This first exercise provides a foundational test of this concept. By analyzing hypothetical data on cricket mating calls, you will practice identifying the tell-tale pattern of trait divergence that occurs only in the zone of interspecific interaction, a process known as reproductive character displacement. [@problem_id:1913168]", "problem": "Two closely related species of field crickets, *Gryllus auralis* and *Gryllus sonorus*, inhabit an archipelago. On some islands, only one of the species is present (allopatric populations), while on other islands, both species coexist (sympatric populations). Male crickets of both species produce a distinctive call to attract females, and this call is a critical component of species recognition. Interspecific mating between *G. auralis* and *G. sonorus* is possible but results in sterile offspring, imposing a strong selective pressure against such pairings.\n\nA team of evolutionary biologists collected data on the dominant frequency of the male mating call for both species from both allopatric and sympatric populations. The mean frequencies are summarized below:\n\n*   **Allopatric Populations:**\n    *   *Gryllus auralis*: 4.8 kHz\n    *   *Gryllus sonorus*: 5.2 kHz\n\n*   **Sympatric Populations:**\n    *   *Gryllus auralis*: 4.5 kHz\n    *   *Gryllus sonorus*: 5.5 kHz\n\nBased on these data, which of the following statements provides the most accurate evolutionary interpretation of the observed pattern?\n\nA. The data show that the call frequencies of the two species diverge in the sympatric zone compared to the allopatric zones. This pattern is a classic example of reproductive character displacement.\n\nB. The data show that the call frequencies converge in the sympatric zone, suggesting that the species are evolving to become more similar due to shared environmental pressures.\n\nC. The data illustrate character release, where the absence of competition in allopatric zones has allowed each species to expand its range of call frequencies, leading to the overlap observed.\n\nD. The data are most consistent with genetic drift being the primary force shaping call frequency, as the observed changes are random and not directionally consistent with selection.\n\nE. The data show no significant difference in the pattern of call frequencies between allopatric and sympatric zones, indicating the calls are under stabilizing selection that is independent of interspecific interactions.", "solution": "Define the mean call frequencies using symbolic labels for population context and species, and then substitute the reported empirical values because the task requires interpreting the observed pattern from the data:\nLet $f_{a}^{\\text{all}}$ and $f_{s}^{\\text{all}}$ be the mean call frequencies of Gryllus auralis and Gryllus sonorus in allopatry, and let $f_{a}^{\\text{sym}}$ and $f_{s}^{\\text{sym}}$ be the corresponding means in sympatry.

Additionally, the shifts are directionally opposite in sympatry (G. auralis shifts downward, G. sonorus shifts upward), reducing acoustic overlap. Given that interspecific matings produce sterile offspring (a strong selective cost), selection should favor increased prezygotic isolation where the species co-occur, specifically via divergence of mate recognition traits. This pattern is the definition of reproductive character displacement (often arising from reinforcement).\n\nEvaluate alternatives:\n- Convergence (option B) is contradicted because the frequencies diverge in sympatry.\n- Character release (option C) predicts broader or more overlapping traits in allopatry due to relaxed interactions; here overlap is smaller in sympatry, not consistent with release.\n- Genetic drift (option D) would not predict consistent, context-dependent directional divergence aligned with selection against hybridization.\n- No difference and stabilizing selection independent of interspecific interactions (option E) is contradicted by $\\Delta^{\\text{sym}}>\\Delta^{\\text{all}}$.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is reproductive character displacement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1913168"}, {"introduction": "Observing trait differences in sympatry is a necessary first step, but not sufficient proof of character displacement. Ecologists must carefully disentangle true displacement from other biological phenomena, such as allometry—the scaling of traits with body size. This practice problem challenges you to act as a critical scientist, using a quantitative index to determine if an observed difference in cichlid jaw morphology is a genuine case of character displacement or simply a byproduct of differences in body size. [@problem_id:1834450]", "problem": "An ecologist is studying resource competition between two species of cichlid fish, the Emerald Cichlid (*Cichla aequa*) and the Ruby Cichlid (*Cichla differa*), in a series of isolated crater lakes. These species feed on gastropods, using their pharyngeal jaws to crush the shells. The researcher hypothesizes that where the two species coexist (in sympatry), they exhibit character displacement in pharyngeal jaw morphology to partition the food resource, with one species evolving larger jaws for harder-shelled snails and the other smaller jaws for softer-shelled snails.\n\nFrom extensive sampling in allopatric lakes (where only one species is present), the baseline allometric relationship between standard body length ($L$, in cm) and pharyngeal jaw width ($J$, in mm) for each species has been firmly established. The relationships, linearized by a natural logarithm transformation, are:\n\nFor *Cichla aequa*: $\\ln(J) = -0.90 + 1.20 \\ln(L)$\nFor *Cichla differa*: $\\ln(J) = -0.70 + 1.20 \\ln(L)$\n\nThe researcher then collects a sample of fish from a specific sympatric lake and measures their average body lengths and jaw widths. The data are as follows:\n- For *Cichla aequa*: average body length is $10.0$ cm, and average pharyngeal jaw width is $6.50$ mm.\n- For *Cichla differa*: average body length is $15.0$ cm, and average pharyngeal jaw width is $12.93$ mm.\n\nBased on the raw jaw sizes, the researcher claims strong evidence for character displacement. You are tasked with critically evaluating this claim. To do so, you must calculate a dimensionless \"displacement index,\" $D$, which quantifies the deviation of the observed jaw size ratio from the ratio that would be expected based purely on the species' allometry and their observed body sizes. The index is defined as:\n\n$$D = \\frac{J_{d,obs}/J_{a,obs}}{J_{d,exp}/J_{a,exp}}$$\n\nwhere the subscript 'a' refers to *C. aequa* and 'd' refers to *C. differa*. The subscript 'obs' indicates the observed mean values from the sympatric lake, and 'exp' indicates the expected mean values calculated from the established allometric equations using the observed mean body lengths. A value of $D=1$ implies that the difference in jaw size is entirely explained by allometry and body size differences, while a value significantly greater than 1 would support the hypothesis of character displacement.\n\nCalculate the value of the displacement index $D$.

The population of *H. ficta* lives in sympatry with a related species, *Hyla aemula* (Species B), whose males call at a constant frequency $f_B$. Cross-species mating attempts are frequent and result in infertile offspring, imposing a selective pressure on *H. ficta* to evolve a call frequency different from $f_B$.

The bat's auditory system is least sensitive to a particular frequency, $f_{opt}$, creating an 'acoustic refuge' for the frogs. Any deviation from this optimal frequency increases predation risk. This imposes stabilizing selection on the call frequency, which is modeled by a selection gradient $G_{stab}(f) = -S_{stab}(f - f_{opt})$, where $S_{stab}$ is a positive constant representing the strength of stabilizing selection.\n\nThe overall selection gradient on the call frequency is the sum of these two components: $G_{total}(f) = G_{div}(f) + G_{stab}(f)$.
