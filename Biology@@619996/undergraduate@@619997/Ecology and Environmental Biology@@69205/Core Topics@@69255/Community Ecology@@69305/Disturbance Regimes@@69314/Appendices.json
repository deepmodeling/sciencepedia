The primary form of disturbance in these fields is the overturning of boulders by wave action, which scours the rock surface clean, forcing new colonization. The sites differ in their exposure to waves:\n\n- **Site A:** Located in a very sheltered cove, where only the most powerful, infrequent storms (occurring once every 5-10 years) can overturn the boulders.\n- **Site B:** Located on a semi-exposed shoreline. Boulders here are overturned by moderate storms, which occur a few times per year.\n- **Site C:** Located on a highly exposed headland, where boulders are overturned by common, strong waves on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.\n\nThe ecologist observes two key space-occupying species in the region:\n1.  A mussel, *Mytilus competitorus*, which is a superior competitor for space. It grows slowly but, once established, can overgrow and eliminate all other species. Its larvae have a low settlement rate on bare rock.\n2.  A barnacle, *Chthamalus rapidus*, which is a poor competitor and is easily overgrown by the mussel. However, it is an excellent pioneer species that matures quickly and releases vast numbers of larvae, allowing it to rapidly colonize any available bare rock.\n\nIn addition to these two, several other species of algae and invertebrates are present in the region, but all are competitively inferior to *M. competitorus* and slower to colonize than *C. rapidus*. Assuming that species diversity is measured by an index that accounts for both the number of different species and their relative abundances, which of the following options correctly ranks the sites from the **lowest** expected species diversity to the **highest** expected species diversity?\n\nA.

This recovery can be modeled as a competition for space between reef-building corals, with fractional cover $C$, and fast-growing macroalgae, with fractional cover $A$. The dynamics are described by the following Lotka-Volterra competition model:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = r_C C (1 - C - \\alpha A) $$\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = r_A A (1 - A - \\beta C) $$\nHere, $t$ is time in years, $r_C$ and $r_A$ are the intrinsic growth rates of corals and algae, respectively. The parameter $\\alpha$ represents the competitive effect of algae on corals, and $\\beta$ represents the competitive effect of corals on algae. The total available space is normalized to 1, so $C+A \\le 1$.\n\nUnder pre-industrial atmospheric conditions ($pCO_2 = 280$ ppm), the reef was highly resilient. The model parameters for this state are $\\alpha = 0.8$ and $\\beta = 1.2$. A major physical disturbance, like a hurricane, can drastically reduce both coral and algal cover, initiating a successional race to recolonize the cleared space.\n\nThe slow press disturbance of ocean acidification due to rising atmospheric $pCO_2$ is known to physiologically stress corals, reducing their competitive ability. This effect can be modeled as a linear decrease in the competition coefficient $\\beta$, while $\\alpha$ is assumed to remain constant. The relationship is given by:\n$$ \\beta(p) = \\beta_{pre-industrial} - k(p - p_{pre-industrial}) $$\nwhere $p$ is the atmospheric $pCO_2$ concentration in parts per million (ppm), $\\beta_{pre-industrial} = 1.2$, $p_{pre-industrial} = 280$ ppm, and $k$ is a positive constant.
