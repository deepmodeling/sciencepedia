One key dimension is niche breadth, which tells us whether a species is a generalist (using many resources) or a specialist (using few).

By working through this problem [@problem_id:1887038], you will gain hands-on practice calculating this important metric and discover how our understanding of a community's niche structure can change dramatically with new information.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the resource utilization of a widespread moth species, *Phalaena ficta*, in a mixed deciduous forest. The ecologist samples the population and records the number of individuals found utilizing five different host plant species. The niche breadth, a measure of the variety of resources a species uses, can be quantified using Levins' index, $B$, given by the formula:\n$$B = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{R} p_i^2}$$\nwhere $R$ is the total number of resource categories (in this case, host plant species) and $p_i$ is the proportion of individuals of the species found utilizing resource category $i$.\n\nInitially, the ecologist collects the following data for what is assumed to be the single species *Phalaena ficta*:\n- Host Plant 1: 250 individuals\n- Host Plant 2: 250 individuals\n- Host Plant 3: 200 individuals\n- Host Plant 4: 150 individuals\n- Host Plant 5: 150 individuals\n\nSubsequent genetic analysis reveals a surprising discovery: *P. ficta* is not a single species but is composed of two morphologically identical cryptic species, Species A and Species B, which are reproductively isolated. The ecologist re-analyzes the original samples using genetic markers and is able to assign each individual to its correct species. The new breakdown of host plant utilization for each specialist species is as follows:\n\n**Species A:**\n- Host Plant 1: 200 individuals\n- Host Plant 2: 200 individuals\n- Host Plant 3: 50 individuals\n- Host Plant 4: 25 individuals\n- Host Plant 5: 25 individuals\n\n**Species B:**\n- Host Plant 1: 50 individuals\n- Host Plant 2: 50 individuals\n- Host Plant 3: 150 individuals\n- Host Plant 4: 125 individuals\n- Host Plant 5: 125 individuals\n\nYour task is to quantify the change in the ecological assessment of niche structure due to this discovery.

The niche breadth is calculated using Levins' index: $B = 1 / \\sum_{i=1}^{R} p_i^2$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the niche breadth of the original \"generalist\" species (*P. ficta*), $B_{total}$.**\n\nFirst, we find the total number of individuals sampled:\n$N_{total} = 250 + 250 + 200 + 150 + 150 = 1000$\n\nNext, we calculate the proportion, $p_i$, of individuals on each host plant:\n$p_1 = 250 / 1000 = 0.25$\n$p_2 = 250 / 1000 = 0.25$\n$p_3 = 200 / 1000 = 0.20$\n$p_4 = 150 / 1000 = 0.15$\n$p_5 = 150 / 1000 = 0.15$\n\nNow, we calculate the sum of the squares of these proportions, $\\sum p_i^2$:\n$\\sum p_{total}^2 = (0.25)^2 + (0.25)^2 + (0.20)^2 + (0.15)^2 + (0.15)^2$\n$\\sum p_{total}^2 = 0.0625 + 0.0625 + 0.0400 + 0.0225 + 0.0225 = 0.2100$\n\nFinally, we calculate $B_{total}$:\n$B_{total} = \\frac{1}{\\sum p_{total}^2} = \\frac{1}{0.2100} \\approx 4.76190$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the niche breadth of Species A, $B_A$.**\n\nFirst, we find the total number of individuals for Species A:\n$N_A = 200 + 200 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 500$\n\nNext, we calculate the proportions, $p_{A,i}$, for Species A:\n$p_{A,1} = 200 / 500 = 0.40$\n$p_{A,2} = 200 / 500 = 0.40$\n$p_{A,3} = 50 / 500 = 0.10$\n$p_{A,4} = 25 / 500 = 0.05$\n$p_{A,5} = 25 / 500 = 0.05$\n\nNow, calculate $\\sum p_{A,i}^2$:\n$\\sum p_A^2 = (0.40)^2 + (0.40)^2 + (0.10)^2 + (0.05)^2 + (0.05)^2$\n$\\sum p_A^2 = 0.1600 + 0.1600 + 0.0100 + 0.0025 + 0.0025 = 0.3350$\n\nFinally, we calculate $B_A$:\n$B_A = \\frac{1}{\\sum p_A^2} = \\frac{1}{0.3350} \\approx 2.98507$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the niche breadth of Species B, $B_B$.**\n\nFirst, we find the total number of individuals for Species B:\n$N_B = 50 + 50 + 150 + 125 + 125 = 500$\n(As a check, $N_A + N_B = 500 + 500 = 1000 = N_{total}$, which is correct.)\n\nNext, we calculate the proportions, $p_{B,i}$, for Species B:\n$p_{B,1} = 50 / 500 = 0.10$\n$p_{B,2} = 50 / 500 = 0.10$\n$p_{B,3} = 150 / 500 = 0.30$\n$p_{B,4} = 125 / 500 = 0.25$\n$p_{B,5} = 125 / 500 = 0.25$\n\nNow, calculate $\\sum p_{B,i}^2$:\n$\\sum p_B^2 = (0.10)^2 + (0.10)^2 + (0.30)^2 + (0.25)^2 + (0.25)^2$\n$\\sum p_B^2 = 0.0100 + 0.0100 + 0.0900 + 0.0625 + 0.0625 = 0.2350$\n\nFinally, we calculate $B_B$:\n$B_B = \\frac{1}{\\sum p_B^2} = \\frac{1}{0.2350} \\approx 4.25532$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final ratio.**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{B_A + B_B}{B_{total}}$.\nFirst, sum the niche breadths of the specialist species:\n$B_A + B_B \\approx 2.98507 + 4.25532 = 7.24039$\n\nNow, compute the ratio:\nRatio $= \\frac{B_A + B_B}{B_{total}} \\approx \\frac{7.24039}{4.76190} \\approx 1.52048$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, we get 1.52. This result indicates that the sum of the niche breadths of the two specialist species is about 52% larger than the niche breadth of the perceived generalist species.

Successfully identifying the most robust experimental design will sharpen your critical thinking and highlight how ecologists use controlled studies to test hypotheses about complex species interactions.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the dynamics of a prairie ecosystem restoration. Two native bunchgrass species, Species A and Species B, are planted in experimental plots. In isolation, both species thrive. However, after the area is unexpectedly colonized by an introduced generalist herbivore, the Fallow Deer, the ecologist observes that plots containing both A and B show a much faster and more severe decline in the biomass of both grass species than plots containing only A or only B. Two primary hypotheses are proposed to explain this enhanced decline when the species coexist:\n\n1.  **Exacerbated Resource Competition:** The Fallow Deer preferentially graze on the most vigorous plants. This selective grazing weakens both Species A and Species B, reducing their ability to compete for limiting resources like soil nitrogen and water. The combined stress of herbivory and intensified resource competition leads to the rapid decline of both.\n2.  **Apparent Competition:** The two grass species do not significantly compete for resources. Instead, the high total plant biomass in the mixed-species plots supports a larger, more concentrated population of deer. This elevated herbivore density leads to greater overall grazing pressure on both species, causing their mutual decline. The competition is \"apparent\" as the species negatively affect each other only through their shared predator.\n\nYou are tasked with designing a field experiment to definitively determine which of these two mechanisms is the primary driver of the observed decline. From the options below, which experimental design is the most robust and complete for distinguishing between exacerbated resource competition and apparent competition? Assume you have access to a large, uniform field area and sufficient fencing materials to create herbivore-proof exclosures.\n\nA. Establish two main treatments: plots with both Species A and B, and plots with only Species A. In half of the plots for each treatment, apply a nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Monitor the biomass of the grasses. This directly tests the role of nutrient limitation.\n\nB. Set up a series of identical mixed-species plots (containing both A and B). Introduce Fallow Deer into these plots at a range of different population densities. Monitor the decline in biomass of both grass species as a function of deer density.\n\nC. Create plots for Species A as the focal species, using a full factorial design with two factors: presence/absence of Species B, and presence/absence of Fallow Deer. This results in four distinct treatment types: (1) Species A alone, deer excluded; (2) Species A with Species B, deer excluded; (3) Species A alone, deer present; (4) Species A with Species B, deer present. The entire setup would be replicated for Species B as the focal species.\n\nD.

Monitor the biomass of the grasses in all plots over several growing seasons.\n\nE. Grow Species A and Species B in a controlled greenhouse environment.

The two hypotheses make distinct, testable predictions about contrasts among these treatment means.\n\nUnder apparent competition:\n1) Mechanism: Negative effects are mediated solely by a shared herbivore via an aggregative or numerical response to higher total biomass; there is little to no direct resource competition.\n2) Predictions:\n   a) With deer excluded, neighbor presence should have negligible effect:\n   $$\n   B_{X}(1,0) \\approx B_{X}(0,0).\n   $$\n   b) With deer present, neighbor presence should reduce focal biomass because mixed plots attract or sustain higher deer pressure:\n   $$\n   B_{X}(1,1) < B_{X}(0,1).\n   $$\n   c) The neighbor effect is therefore strongly deer dependent.

The outcome of their competition can be predicted using Tilman's resource-ratio theory. The key parameters for each species $j$ are its break-even resource concentrations ($R^*_{Si,j}$ and $R^*_{N,j}$), below which net growth is negative, and its per-biomass resource consumption constants ($c_{Si,j}$ and $c_{N,j}$). A species can achieve positive net growth only when the ambient concentrations of both silicate and nitrate are above their respective $R^*$ values.\n\nThe parameters for the two species are as follows:\n\nFor *Thalassiosira competitora* (Species A):\n-   $R^*_{Si,A} = 1.2$ micromoles/liter\n-   $R^*_{N,A} = 5.0$ micromoles/liter\n-   $c_{Si,A} = 0.08$ micromoles of Si per mg of biomass\n-   $c_{N,A} = 0.50$ micromoles of N per mg of biomass\n\nFor *Asterionella ecologica* (Species B):\n-   $R^*_{Si,B} = 3.5$ micromoles/liter\n-   $R^*_{N,B} = 1.8$ micromoles/liter\n-   $c_{Si,B} = 0.30$ micromoles of Si per mg of biomass\n-   $c_{N,B} = 0.20$ micromoles of N per mg of biomass\n\nThese species inhabit a region with a strong environmental gradient, causing the supply ratio of silicate to nitrate to vary significantly.

The outcome of competition between two species for two limiting resources is determined by their respective break-even resource concentrations ($R^*$) and their resource consumption vectors.\n\nFirst, we must determine the competitive abilities of each species for each resource. A species is a superior competitor for a resource if it has a lower $R^*$ value for that resource, meaning it can sustain its population at a lower ambient concentration.\n-   For silicate (Si): $R^*_{Si,A} = 1.2 \\, \\mu\\text{M}$ and $R^*_{Si,B} = 3.5 \\, \\mu\\text{M}$.

Since $R^*_{N,B} < R^*_{N,A}$, *Asterionella ecologica* (Species B) is the superior competitor for nitrate.\n\nBecause each species is a superior competitor for a different resource, there is a possibility for stable coexistence.\n\nThe graphical representation of this theory uses Zero Net Growth Isoclines (ZNGIs). The ZNGI for a species is an L-shaped line in the resource plane (e.g., $R_{Si}$ vs. $R_N$), with the corner at $(R^*_{Si}, R^*_{N})$. A stable coexistence equilibrium can occur at the intersection of the two ZNGIs, where each species' growth is limited by the resource for which it is the poorer competitor. This equilibrium point, E, has coordinates $(R_{Si}, R_N) = (R^*_{Si,B}, R^*_{N,A})$.\n-   At this point, Species A is limited by nitrate ($R_N = R^*_{N,A}$).\n-   At this point, Species B is limited by silicate ($R_{Si} = R^*_{Si,B}$).\n\nCoexistence is stable if the resource supply point, $(S_{Si}, S_N)$, lies within a specific \"coexistence cone\" a region in the supply space. The boundaries of this cone are determined by the consumption vectors of the two species. The consumption vector for a species $j$ reflects the ratio in which it consumes the two resources, and its slope in the ($R_{Si}$, $R_N$) plane is given by $c_{N,j}/c_{Si,j}$.

Let's analyze the regions outside this range:\n-   If $\\frac{S_{Si}}{S_N} < 0.16$, the supply of silicate is very low relative to nitrate. In this scenario, competition is primarily for silicate. The superior competitor for silicate, Species A (*T. competitora*), will drive Species B to extinction.
