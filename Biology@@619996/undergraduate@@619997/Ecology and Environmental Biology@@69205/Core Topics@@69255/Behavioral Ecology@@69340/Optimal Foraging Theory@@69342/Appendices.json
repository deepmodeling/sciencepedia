The bee's strategy is to visit a patch, collect nectar for a certain amount of time, and then fly to the next patch. The cumulative energy, $E$, in microjoules ($\\mu$J), that a bee extracts from a single patch is a function of the time, $t_p$, in seconds, spent foraging within that patch. This relationship is well-described by the saturating function:\n$$E(t_p) = \\frac{A \\cdot t_p}{B + t_p}$$\nwhere $A = 240$ $\\mu$J is the maximum energy that can be extracted from a patch, and $B = 15$ seconds is a time constant related to the nectar extraction rate.\n\nThe time it takes for a bee to travel from one patch to the next, $t_{\\text{travel}}$, is a constant 60 seconds.
