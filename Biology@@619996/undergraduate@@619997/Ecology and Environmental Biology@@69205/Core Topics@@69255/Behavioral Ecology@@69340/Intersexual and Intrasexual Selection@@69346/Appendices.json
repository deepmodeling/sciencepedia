This practice problem explores the fascinating case of the deep-sea anglerfish, where males have evolved to be parasitic dwarfs. By analyzing their unique life cycle, you will learn to distinguish between natural selection for survival, intrasexual \"scramble\" competition for mates, and intersexual mate choice, clarifying which pressures are most potent for each sex in this highly unusual system [@problem_id:1855941].", "problem": "In the abyssal zone of the ocean, a species of anglerfish, *Cryptophotichthys abyssalis*, exhibits one of the most extreme examples of sexual dimorphism known in vertebrates. Upon hatching, both male and female larvae are free-swimming. The female develops into a large, predatory organism, equipped with a bioluminescent lure (esca) to attract prey in the perpetual darkness. The male, however, develops into a dwarf form that is essentially a mobile reproductive system. His primary life goal is to locate a female. Once a female is found, the male bites onto her body, and their tissues and circulatory systems permanently fuse. The male's body then atrophies, leaving him as a parasitic appendage that provides sperm on demand in exchange for nutrients from the female's blood. The environment is vast, and population densities are extremely low, making encounters between individuals a rare event.\n\nConsider the following statements regarding the evolutionary pressures on this species:\n\nI. Males experience intense intrasexual selection primarily in the form of scramble competition, favoring traits that enhance mate-finding ability, such as superior chemosensory organs.\nII. Females experience intense intersexual selection, choosing males based on elaborate courtship displays or physical combat prowess.\nIII. Female fitness is primarily determined by natural selection for traits related to survival and resource acquisition in the challenging deep-sea environment, such as a larger body size and an effective bioluminescent lure.\nIV. Males experience strong selection for larger body size and aggressive behaviors to engage in contest competition for access to females.\nV. Due to the parasitic nature of the males, both sexes experience a relaxation of sexual selection pressures compared to species with independent males and females.\n\nWhich of the following combinations of statements accurately describe the dominant selective pressures acting on the males and females of this species?\n\nA. I and II only\n\nB. I and III only\n\nC. II and IV only\n\nD. III and V only\n\nE. I, III, and IV only", "solution": "First, identify the relevant selection modes. Sexual selection includes intrasexual selection (competition within a sex) and intersexual selection (mate choice). Intrasexual selection can take the form of contest competition (direct fighting for mates) or scramble competition (racing to locate mates). Natural selection here refers to ecological survival and resource acquisition traits that increase survival and fecundity.\n\nEvaluate statement I: In an extremely low-density environment where encounters are rare, males that more effectively locate females will have disproportionate reproductive success. This is the hallmark of intrasexual selection via scramble competition. Traits that enhance detection and localization of females (e.g., enhanced chemosensory or mechanosensory systems) are favored. This is consistent with the described biology of dwarf parasitic males whose sole objective is to find and fuse with a female. Therefore, I is correct.\n\nEvaluate statement II: Intersexual selection on females choosing among males based on elaborate displays or physical combat prowess requires that males present variation in courtship traits and that females exert choice. In this system, males are dwarfed, fuse upon contact, and do not engage in displays or combat; opportunities for female choice are minimal to nonexistent. Therefore, II is incorrect.\n\nEvaluate statement III: Females must survive and secure resources in the deep sea and produce large numbers of eggs. Traits such as larger body size and an effective bioluminescent lure directly increase prey capture and fecundity, indicating strong natural selection on these survival and resource-acquisition traits. Therefore, III is correct.\n\nEvaluate statement IV: Contest competition for access to females selects for larger, aggressive males. In this species, males are extremely small and non-combative; selection favors efficient mate finding rather than fighting ability or large size. Therefore, IV is incorrect.\n\nEvaluate statement V: While female sexual selection likely is reduced due to limited choice, male sexual selection is not relaxed; it is extremely strong because failure to locate a female results in zero fitness. Thus the claim that both sexes experience a relaxation of sexual selection is false. Therefore, V is incorrect.\n\nOnly statements I and III accurately describe the dominant selective pressures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1855941"}, {"introduction": "Sexual selection is not always about males competing for females, and this exercise is designed to challenge that common assumption. You will examine a hypothetical polyandrous bird species where females compete aggressively for resource-rich territories in order to attract males, who are the sole caregivers. This scenario of sex-role reversal requires a precise application of the definition of intrasexual selection, demonstrating that it is fundamentally about competition within one sex for access to the other, regardless of which sex is competing [@problem_id:1855959].", "problem": "In the ecology of the fictional bird species, the Crimson-Throated Sun-Gazer (*Heliornis coccinus*), a peculiar reproductive strategy has been observed. The species is polyandrous, where a female may mate with multiple males in a season. However, males are the sole providers of parental care, incubating the eggs and feeding the nestlings exclusively with nectar from a specific flowering plant. The abundance of this plant varies significantly across different territories.\n\nBefore the breeding season begins, females engage in intense, often aggressive, competition with other females to establish and defend these territories. A female's ability to secure a territory rich in nectar-producing plants is the primary determinant of how many males she can attract to mate with and lay eggs for, as males will only associate with females who control a viable territory.\n\nBased on this scenario, how would an evolutionary biologist most accurately categorize the observed competition among the female Crimson-Throated Sun-Gazers for food-rich territories?\n\nA. Intersexual selection, because the choice of territory by a female is a form of mate choice.\n\nB. Natural selection, because the competition is primarily for a food resource essential for offspring survival, not directly for mates.\n\nC. Intrasexual selection, because a limiting resource (territory) directly controls access to mates, leading to competition within one sex.\n\nD. Kin selection, because females may be indirectly helping related individuals by defending a large territory.\n\nE. Stabilizing selection, because it favors intermediate-sized territories over extremely small or large ones.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the definitions relevant to evolutionary mechanisms:\n- Sexual selection is the component of natural selection that arises from variance in mating success.\n- Intrasexual selection refers to competition among individuals of the same sex for access to mates, which can be mediated directly (fighting) or indirectly via control of resources that grant access to mates.\n- Intersexual selection refers to mate choice, where individuals of one sex prefer certain traits in the other sex.\n- Kin selection involves traits that increase the reproductive success of relatives, weighted by relatedness.\n- Stabilizing selection favors intermediate phenotypes over extremes in a continuous trait distribution.\n\nIn the scenario, key observations are:\n1. The species is polyandrous and males provide exclusive parental care. This commonly leads to a sex-role reversal in which females compete for access to mates and males are choosier, because male parental investment is high and thus males become the limiting reproductive resource.\n2. Males associate only with females who control a viable, nectar-rich territory. Therefore, a femaleâ€™s control of a high-quality territory directly determines her mating success, i.e., how many males she can attract.\n3. Females engage in aggressive competition with other females to secure and defend such territories before breeding.\n\nFrom these observations, the competition among females for food-rich territories is best classified as intrasexual selection: females of the same sex compete over a limiting resource (territory quality) that directly controls access to mates. Although the proximate object of competition is a resource (nectar plants), the ultimate fitness currency being competed over is mating opportunities, as explicitly stated by the link between territory quality and the number of males attracted.\n\nWhy the other options are not the best classification:\n- Option A (Intersexual selection) focuses on mate choice. While males may be exercising intersexual choice by selecting females with good territories, the question asks specifically about the competition among females, which is intrasexual, not intersexual.\n- Option B (Natural selection for food) is incomplete because, despite involving a resource, the selection here is specifically on traits that increase mating success via resource control, a hallmark of sexual selection. The problem states that territory quality is the primary determinant of how many mates a female can secure, directly tying the competition to mating success.\n- Option D (Kin selection) is unsupported; there is no indication that females are helping relatives or that inclusive fitness benefits via kin are driving the behavior.\n- Option E (Stabilizing selection) presumes a continuous distribution of territory sizes with intermediate optima favored; this is not described and does not address the competitive mechanism observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is intrasexual selection within females driven by resource control that grants access to mates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1855959"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a conceptual understanding to a quantitative one is a key skill in evolutionary biology. This problem presents a classic trade-off in intersexual selection, asking you to calculate and compare the fitness of two distinct male strategies: providing a direct nutritional benefit versus displaying an \"honest signal\" of genetic quality. By modeling the expected reproductive success over time, you will gain hands-on experience evaluating the evolutionary outcomes of traits driven by female choice [@problem_id:1855939].", "problem": "In a population of the hypothetical Gilded Thornbird, two distinct male mating strategies, driven by female choice (intersexual selection), have been observed. Ecologists aim to compare the relative fitness of these two strategies.\n\nThe first strategy is that of a \"Provider.\" These males capture a specific type of high-energy insect to present to a female as a nuptial gift. This provides a direct nutritional benefit to the female. A male attempting this strategy has a probability $p_P$ of successfully presenting the gift and mating in a given season, which results in him siring $N_P$ offspring. The significant effort and risk involved in this foraging reduces his probability of surviving to the next breeding season to $S_P$.\n\nThe second strategy is that of a \"Showman.\" These males grow a vibrant, iridescent throat patch called a gorget. This is an \"honest signal\" of genetic quality, an indirect benefit for the female. A male with a competitive gorget has a probability $p_S$ of being chosen by a female in a season, resulting in him siring $N_S$ offspring. The metabolic cost and increased predation risk of maintaining the gorget reduce his seasonal survival probability to $S_S$.\n\nTo quantify the evolutionary success of each strategy, a simplified fitness metric ($W$) is defined as the total expected number of offspring over a two-season period. This is calculated as the expected number of offspring sired in the current season plus the expected number of offspring in the subsequent season. Assume that any male who survives to the next season will achieve a baseline reproductive success of $N_0$ offspring in that second season.\n\nGiven the following field data:\n- Baseline reproductive success for a surviving male, $N_0 = 1.5$ offspring.\n- Provider strategy: $p_P = 0.60$, $N_P = 4.0$ offspring, $S_P = 0.40$.\n- Showman strategy: $p_S = 0.85$, $N_S = 3.0$ offspring, $S_S = 0.25$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the fitness of the Provider strategy to the fitness of the Showman strategy, $W_P / W_S$.

Survival to the next season occurs with probability $S_{X}$, and any survivor sires $N_{0}$ offspring in that second season, so the expected subsequent-season offspring is $S_{X}N_{0}$.
