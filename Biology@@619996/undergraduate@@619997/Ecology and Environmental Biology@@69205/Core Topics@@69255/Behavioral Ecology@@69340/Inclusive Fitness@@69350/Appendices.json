This first exercise [@problem_id:1854629] provides a foundational application of this rule using the classic example of food sharing in vampire bats. By calculating the minimum benefit-to-cost ratio required for altruism to evolve, you will gain a quantitative understanding of the trade-offs involved when an individual's actions benefit a relative at a cost to itself.", "problem": "In a colony of vampire bats (*Desmodus rotundus*), individuals often fail to secure a blood meal on any given night. A bat that goes without food for more than two consecutive nights risks starvation. A common behavior observed is that well-fed bats will regurgitate a portion of their blood meal to feed a starving roost-mate. This act of sharing is considered altruistic, as it carries a fitness cost, denoted by $C$, to the donor bat, while providing a significant fitness benefit, $B$, to the recipient.\n\nConsider a specific instance where a donor bat shares food with a recipient to whom it has a coefficient of relatedness of $r = 0.25$. Assuming this behavior is governed by the principles of inclusive fitness, calculate the minimum required ratio of benefit to cost ($B/C$) for this altruistic act to be evolutionarily advantageous.", "solution": "Under inclusive fitness, Hamilton's rule states that an altruistic act is favored by natural selection if the donor's loss in direct fitness, denoted by $C$, is outweighed by the recipient's gain in fitness, denoted by $B$, weighted by the coefficient of relatedness $r$. The condition is:\n$$\nrB > C.\n$$\nRearranging to express the condition in terms of the benefit-to-cost ratio yields:\n$$\n\\frac{B}{C} > \\frac{1}{r}.\n$$\nGiven $r = 0.25 = \\frac{1}{4}$, we substitute into the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{B}{C} > \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 4.\n$$\nThus, the minimum required ratio of benefit to cost for the altruistic act to be evolutionarily advantageous is $4$ (i.e., $B/C$ must exceed $4$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1854629"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the abstract formula, this practice problem [@problem_id:1854667] challenges you to apply Hamilton's rule to a realistic ecological scenario involving cooperative breeding in Florida Scrub-Jays. Here, the fitness costs ($C$) and benefits ($B$) are not given directly but must be derived from tangible biological data—the number of offspring and their probability of survival. This exercise hones your ability to translate complex life-history trade-offs into the variables of inclusive fitness theory, a crucial skill for any biologist studying social behavior.", "problem": "In a studied population of Florida Scrub-Jays (*Aphelocoma coerulescens*), some individuals delay their own reproduction to act as 'helpers at the nest'. Consider a specific scenario where a helper forgoes its own breeding for a season to assist its parents. If this helper had bred on its own, it would have produced a clutch of $N_C = 3$ offspring. Historical data from the population indicates that the probability of any of the helper's own offspring surviving to reproductive age is $S_C = 0.40$. With the helper's assistance in foraging and territory defense, its parents are able to successfully raise an additional $N_B = 6$ offspring that they would not have been able to raise otherwise. These additional offspring are full siblings to the helper. Assuming the population is diploid and outbred, calculate the minimum survival probability to reproductive age for the siblings, which we will call $S_B$, above which this helping behavior is evolutionarily favored.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "We apply Hamilton's rule, which states that a helping behavior is favored when the inclusive fitness benefit exceeds the cost, expressed as\n$$\nr B > C,\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the coefficient of relatedness between the actor and the beneficiaries, $B$ is the increase in the beneficiaries' reproductive success due to the act, and $C$ is the loss in the actor's own reproductive success.\n\nFor this scenario:\n- The cost is the expected number of the helper's own offspring that would survive to reproductive age if it bred, which is\n$$\nC = N_{C} S_{C}.\n$$\n- The benefit is the expected number of additional full siblings raised to reproductive age due to helping, weighted by relatedness, which is\n$$\nr B = r \\left(N_{B} S_{B}\\right).\n$$\n\nThe threshold condition at which helping is selectively neutral (and thus the minimum $S_{B}$ above which helping is favored) is obtained by setting equality:\n$$\nr N_{B} S_{B}^{\\ast} = N_{C} S_{C}.\n$$\nSolving for $S_{B}^{\\ast}$ gives\n$$\nS_{B}^{\\ast} = \\frac{N_{C} S_{C}}{r N_{B}}.\n$$\n\nFor diploid, outbred full siblings, the coefficient of relatedness is $r = \\frac{1}{2}$.

This problem [@problem_id:1854677] delves into the world of haplodiploid honeybees, where the standard calculations of relatedness do not apply. By calculating the coefficient of relatedness ($r$) between a worker bee and her brother from first principles, you will uncover the genetic asymmetries that drive potential conflicts within the colony and understand why workers are evolutionarily predisposed to favor rearing sisters over brothers.", "problem": "In a honeybee (*Apis mellifera*) colony, the genetic system is haplodiploid. The queen is diploid, having developed from a fertilized egg. She mates with a single haploid male (a drone) during her nuptial flight and stores his sperm. To produce female offspring (workers or new queens), she fertilizes an egg with this stored sperm, resulting in a diploid female. To produce male offspring (drones), she lays an unfertilized egg, which develops into a haploid male. Consequently, a drone has a mother (the queen) but no father.\n\nConsider a single worker bee and her brother (a drone), both offspring of the same queen. Based on this reproductive system, determine the genetic relatedness between the worker and her brother, and the resulting evolutionary pressure on worker behavior. The coefficient of relatedness, $r$, is defined as the probability that a randomly chosen allele in one individual is identical by descent to a randomly chosen allele at the same gene locus in another individual.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the coefficient of relatedness ($r$) between the worker bee and her drone brother, and accurately describes the resulting strategic preference for the worker based on principles of kin selection?\n\nA. $r = 0.25$; this implies workers are evolutionarily biased to favor investment in rearing new sisters over new brothers.\n\nB. $r = 0.50$; this implies workers should invest equally in rearing sisters and brothers, as they are equally related to both.\n\nC. $r = 0.75$; this implies workers are evolutionarily biased to favor investment in rearing new brothers over new sisters.\n\nD. $r = 0.25$; this implies workers are evolutionarily biased to favor investment in rearing new brothers over new sisters.\n\nE. $r = 0.50$; this implies workers are evolutionarily biased to favor investment in rearing new sisters over new brothers.", "solution": "In haplodiploid honeybees, a worker (diploid) has one maternal allele and one paternal allele at each locus, while her drone brother (haploid) has only one allele per locus, inherited from the mother (the queen).\n\nLet $r$ denote the coefficient of relatedness between the worker and her drone brother. By definition, $r$ is the probability that a randomly chosen allele from the worker at a locus is identical by descent to a randomly chosen allele at the same locus in her brother.\n\nPartition on the origin of the worker’s sampled allele:\n- With probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, the worker’s allele is paternal. The brother’s allele is maternally derived, and assuming no inbreeding between the queen and the drone father, these alleles cannot be identical by descent. This branch contributes $0$.\n- With probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, the worker’s allele is maternal. The brother’s allele is also maternal, both drawn from the queen’s two alleles.
