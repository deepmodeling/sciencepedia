This scenario [@problem_id:2277852] requires you to apply the inclusive fitness inequality, often stated as $r \\sum B_i > C$, where the total benefit to multiple relatives is weighted by their genetic relatedness. Mastering this calculation is the first step toward understanding how altruism can evolve even when it comes at a personal cost.", "problem": "In a population of a diploid, sexually-reproducing ground-dwelling mammal, an individual can perform an altruistic act by sounding an alarm call upon spotting a predator. This action alerts other members of its social group but increases the caller's personal probability of being captured.\n\nLet the fitness cost, $C$, to the individual giving the call be defined as $C = 0.05$. The alarm call is heard by a nearby group consisting of four of the caller's full siblings. For each of these four siblings, the warning provides a fitness benefit, $B_{\\text{ind}}$, of $0.10$.\n\nAccording to the principles of kin selection and inclusive fitness, would this altruistic behavior be evolutionarily favored in this specific scenario? Select the option that provides the correct conclusion and reasoning.\n\nA. Yes, because the total benefit to the siblings ($0.40$) is greater than the cost to the caller ($0.05$).\n\nB. Yes, because the relatedness-weighted benefit ($0.20$) is greater than the direct fitness cost to the caller ($0.05$).\n\nC. No, because any behavior that incurs a personal fitness cost, however small, will be selected against by natural selection.\n\nD. No, because the fitness benefit to a single sibling ($0.10$) is not large enough to justify the cost to the caller ($0.05$).\n\nE. No, because the relatedness-weighted benefit ($0.20$) is less than the total benefit accrued by the siblings ($0.40$).", "solution": "Apply Hamilton's rule from kin selection: an altruistic behavior is favored when the inclusive fitness condition $r \\sum B_{i} > C$ holds, where $r$ is the coefficient of relatedness between the actor and each recipient, $B_{i}$ is the fitness benefit to recipient $i$, and $C$ is the fitness cost to the actor.\n\nFor full siblings in a diploid, sexually reproducing species without inbreeding, the coefficient of relatedness is $r = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThere are four full siblings, each receiving a benefit $B_{\\text{ind}} = 0.10$, so the total benefit across recipients is\n$$\nB_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} B_{i} = 4 \\times 0.10 = 0.40.\n$$\nThe relatedness-weighted benefit is therefore\n$$\nr B_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.40 = 0.20.\n$$\nCompare this to the direct cost $C = 0.05$.

This practice [@problem_id:1857688] delves into the social structure of a lion pride, challenging you to determine the relatedness between an uncle and his nephew from their pedigree. By calculating this value of $r$ yourself, you can then use Hamilton's rule to find the precise threshold where a selfless act of defense becomes an evolutionarily sound strategy.", "problem": "In a simplified model of a lion pride's social dynamics, two dominant males, Male A and Male B, cooperate to defend the pride. These two males are half-brothers, sharing the same mother but having different fathers. We can assume the population is large and outbred, meaning their respective fathers are unrelated to each other and to their shared mother.\n\nMale A successfully sires a cub. One day, this cub is cornered by a hyena, and Male B has the opportunity to intervene and defend it. This act of defense is not without risk; undertaking the defense imposes a fitness cost on Male B, which is quantified as a loss of $0.35$ in his expected future reproductive success (i.e., cost $C = 0.35$). For this altruistic act of defense to be an evolutionarily stable strategy favored by kin selection, the fitness benefit to the cub must outweigh the cost to Male B, as weighted by their genetic relatedness.\n\nAssuming diploid genetics, calculate the minimum fitness benefit ($B$) that the cub must receive for Male B's altruistic behavior to be favored. Express your answer as a real number.", "solution": "We use Hamilton’s rule for kin selection: an altruistic act is favored when $rB > C$, where $r$ is the coefficient of relatedness between actor and recipient, $B$ is the fitness benefit to the recipient, and $C$ is the fitness cost to the actor.\n\nFirst, compute the relatedness $r$ between Male B and the cub sired by Male A. Male A and Male B are half-brothers sharing the same mother and unrelated fathers, so their relatedness is\n$$\nr_{\\text{A,B}} = \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nThe cub is the direct offspring of Male A, so the relatedness between Male A and the cub is\n$$\nr_{\\text{A,cub}} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nTherefore, the relatedness between Male B and the cub is the product along the pedigree path (Male B $\\to$ Mother $\\to$ Male A $\\to$ cub), which yields\n$$\nr_{\\text{B,cub}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{8}.\n$$\nEquivalently, $r_{\\text{B,cub}} = r_{\\text{A,B}} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nApplying Hamilton’s rule with cost $C = 0.35$, the minimum benefit $B_{\\min}$ required for the altruistic defense to be favored satisfies\n$$\nrB_{\\min} = C \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad B_{\\min} = \\frac{C}{r} = \\frac{0.35}{\\frac{1}{8}} = 0.35 \\times 8 = 2.8.\n$$\nThus, the minimum fitness benefit to the cub is $2.8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.8}$$", "id": "1857688"}, {"introduction": "Hamilton's rule is not limited to explaining altruism; it is a general framework for any social behavior affecting kin. This final practice [@problem_id:1857680] demonstrates this power by applying inclusive fitness logic to the seemingly paradoxical behavior of siblicide. You will determine the critical environmental conditions, expressed as a relationship between survival probabilities, under which natural selection would favor a chick killing its own sibling, providing a deeper insight into the limits of family cooperation.", "problem": "In a population of eagles, nests typically contain two chicks that are full siblings from a monogamous pairing. During periods of resource scarcity, the physically stronger chick may kill its weaker sibling in an act of siblicide, thereby securing all parental provisions for itself.\n\nLet $P_1$ represent the probability of a single chick surviving to reproductive age if it receives all available resources in the nest.

It can be assumed that $0 < P_2 < P_1 \\le 1$.\n\nFrom the perspective of the stronger chick, the decision to commit siblicide can be analyzed using the principles of kin selection. According to Hamilton's rule, this selfish act is evolutionarily favored when the ratio of the shared-resource survival probability to the full-resource survival probability, $P_2/P_1$, falls below a certain critical threshold.\n\nDetermine this critical threshold as a symbolic expression in terms of the coefficient of relatedness, $r$.", "solution": "Let the stronger chick consider two options. If it commits siblicide, its own survival probability becomes $P_{1}$ and the sibling's survival becomes $0$. If it shares, both chicks have survival probability $P_{2}$. Under inclusive fitness, the payoff to the actor equals its own survival plus $r$ times the sibling's survival.\n\nTherefore, the inclusive fitness when committing siblicide is $P_{1}$, and when sharing is $P_{2} + r P_{2} = P_{2}(1 + r)$.
