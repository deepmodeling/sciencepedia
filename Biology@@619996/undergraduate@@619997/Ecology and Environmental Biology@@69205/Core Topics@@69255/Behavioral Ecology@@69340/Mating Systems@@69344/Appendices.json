{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To understand the evolution of polygyny, we must consider the choices from a female's perspective. The Polygyny Threshold Model provides a powerful framework for this, predicting that a female's choice to mate with an already-mated male hinges on a critical trade-off between territory quality and the cost of sharing a mate. This exercise lets you quantify this trade-off, calculating the precise point at which it becomes more beneficial for a female to be a secondary mate on a superior territory than a sole mate on an inferior one, a core concept in behavioral ecology [@problem_id:1755518].", "problem": "In a population of Saffron-crested Warblers, males establish and defend territories of varying quality. The quality of a territory directly impacts the reproductive success of a female nesting there. Reproductive success, or fitness, is measured by the number of offspring a female successfully fledges in a season.\n\nA newly-arrived female evaluates two potential mating opportunities:\n1.  **Male A** is unmated and defends a territory of standard quality. If the female chooses to mate with him in a monogamous pair bond, her expected reproductive fitness is **5** fledglings.\n2.  **Male B** is already mated to one female but defends a superior, high-quality territory. The resources on this territory are so abundant that if a female were the *sole* mate (i.e., in a monogamous pair), her expected fitness would be **9** fledglings. However, choosing Male B means entering a polygynous relationship and becoming the secondary female. This requires sharing the male's parental assistance and territory resources, which incurs a \"cost of polygyny.\"\n\nThe female's choice is governed by the evolutionary drive to maximize her own reproductive fitness. According to the Polygyny Threshold Model, which of the following statements correctly describes the condition under which the newly-arrived female would choose to mate with the already-mated Male B?\n\nA. The female will choose Male B if the cost of polygyny reduces her expected number of fledglings by exactly 4.\n\nB. The female will choose Male B if the cost of polygyny reduces her expected number of fledglings by 5 or more.\n\nC. The female will choose Male B because his territory is of higher quality, regardless of the cost of polygyny.\n\nD. The female will choose Male B if the cost of polygyny reduces her expected number of fledglings by 3 or less.\n\nE. The female will always choose the unmated Male A to guarantee undivided parental care.", "solution": "Define the female’s expected fitness with each option. Let $W_{A}$ be the expected fitness if she mates monogamously with Male A, and let $W_{B}$ be the expected fitness if she mates polygynously as the secondary female with Male B. Let $C$ denote the cost of polygyny in terms of the reduction in expected fledglings due to sharing the male’s parental care and territory resources.\n\nGiven in the problem:\n- $W_{A} = 5$.\n- If monogamous with Male B on his superior territory, the expected fitness would be $9$ fledglings. Under polygyny, the cost $C$ reduces this, so\n$$\nW_{B} = 9 - C.\n$$\n\nThe female maximizes her own expected fitness, so she will choose Male B if and only if\n$$\nW_{B} > W_{A}.\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions,\n$$\n9 - C > 5 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad C < 4.\n$$\n\nThus, the polygyny threshold (the point of indifference) occurs when $C = 4$, because then $9 - C = 5 = W_{A}$ and the female is indifferent. For a strict preference for Male B (i.e., the case in which she would choose B), we require $C < 4$.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A: If $C = 4$, then $W_{B} = 5$, which equals $W_{A}$; she is indifferent, not strictly choosing B. Hence A is incorrect.\n- B: If $C \\geq 5$, then $W_{B} \\leq 4 < 5$; she would not choose B. Hence B is incorrect.\n- C: Territory quality alone is not sufficient; the cost matters. Hence C is incorrect.\n- D: If $C \\leq 3$, then $W_{B} \\geq 6 > 5$, ensuring she chooses B. This condition is a sufficient and correct description of when she would choose B.\n- E: Always choosing A is not optimal when $C$ is small enough. Hence E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1755518"}, {"introduction": "Mating systems are often shaped by competition between males, where different behavioral strategies can coexist. Game theory offers a formal way to analyze these conflicts, using the concept of an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) to find strategies that are immune to invasion by alternatives. In this problem, you will use a payoff matrix to model the interaction between territorial \"Guarder\" males and non-territorial \"Sneaker\" males, determining the conditions under which the sneaker strategy can become the dominant, stable strategy in the population [@problem_id:1862742].", "problem": "In a population of cichlid fish, two distinct male mating strategies have been observed. The \"Guarder\" (G) strategy involves large males that establish and aggressively defend territories containing nests where females lay eggs. The \"Sneaker\" (S) strategy involves smaller, non-territorial males that attempt to intrude on a Guarder's territory to fertilize some of the eggs.\n\nWe can model the evolutionary dynamics of these strategies using a simple payoff matrix, where payoffs represent reproductive fitness (proportional to the number of successful fertilizations). Let $V$ be the total reproductive value of a nest, $C$ be the fitness cost incurred by a Guarder from an escalated fight, and $\\alpha$ be the fraction of eggs a Sneaker male fertilizes when it successfully intrudes on a Guarder's nest (where $0 < \\alpha < 1$). The interactions are defined as follows:\n\n1.  When a Guarder male encounters another Guarder male over a nest, they engage in an escalated fight. The expected fitness payoff for each Guarder from this interaction is $\\frac{V-C}{2}$.\n2.  When a Guarder male encounters a Sneaker male at its nest, the Guarder defends, and the Sneaker attempts to fertilize eggs. The Guarder's fitness payoff is $(1-\\alpha)V$, while the Sneaker's fitness payoff is $\\alpha V$.\n3.  When a Sneaker male encounters another Sneaker male at the same nest (which is defended by an unnamed Guarder), they compete with each other, effectively \"sharing\" the opportunity. The fitness payoff for each Sneaker from this interaction is $\\frac{\\alpha V}{2}$.\n\nAn Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) is a strategy that, if adopted by nearly all members of a population, cannot be invaded by an alternative \"mutant\" strategy.

Even in socially monogamous pairs, the evolutionary interests of males and females are not perfectly aligned, leading to sexual conflict over how much effort each should invest in their offspring. This practice uses a mathematical model to explore this conflict, allowing you to compare the \"selfish\" investment level each parent would choose on its own versus a hypothetical \"cooperative\" level that maximizes their joint fitness, revealing a fundamental tension in parental partnerships [@problem_id:1862728].", "problem": "In an idealized model of a socially monogamous bird species, parental care is provided by both the male and the female. The success of a breeding attempt, measured by the number of surviving offspring, $N$, depends on the total parental effort, $E$, expended by the pair.

The constant $k$ is a positive parameter related to the quality of the breeding territory.\n\nHowever, exerting effort is costly, as it diminishes a parent's chances of future survival and reproduction. This fitness cost, $C$, for an individual parent is a quadratic function of their own effort level, $e$: $C(e) = \\beta e^2$, where $\\beta$ is a positive constant.\n\nAn individual parent's net fitness, $W$, is the benefit gained from the current brood minus the future cost.
