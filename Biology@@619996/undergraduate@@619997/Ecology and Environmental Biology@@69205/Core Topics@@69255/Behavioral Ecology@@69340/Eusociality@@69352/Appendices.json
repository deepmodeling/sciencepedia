This practice challenges you to apply the formal biological criteria of eusociality to a fascinating and often misunderstood organism, the Portuguese man o' war. By dissecting this borderline case [@problem_id:1846609], you will learn to distinguish between a true society of cooperating individuals and a single, colonial organism with specialized parts, thereby sharpening your understanding of what truly constitutes a eusocial system.", "problem": "Eusociality represents one of the most advanced forms of social organization in animals. Biologists typically define a species as eusocial if its members meet three specific criteria:\n1.  Reproductive division of labor, where some individuals (a \"worker\" caste) are sterile or have significantly reduced fertility and assist the reproductive individuals (a \"queen\" or reproductive caste).\n2.  Overlapping generations, where offspring coexist with and assist their parents.\n3.  Cooperative care of the young (brood).\n\nConsider the Portuguese man o' war (*Physalia physalis*). It is commonly mistaken for a jellyfish but is actually a siphonophore, a colonial organism. A single man o' war colony originates from a single fertilized egg and grows through budding to form a collection of genetically identical, specialized polyps called zooids. These zooids are physically connected and integrated, and cannot survive independently. The colony includes four main types of zooids:\n-   **Pneumatophore**: A single, large, gas-filled polyp that serves as a float.\n-   **Dactylozooids**: Long tentacles armed with stinging cells, used for defense and capturing prey. These are non-reproductive.\n-   **Gastrozooids**: Polyps responsible for digesting prey. These are non-reproductive.\n-   **Gonozooids**: Polyps specialized for reproduction, which release gametes into the water.\n\nBased on the provided definitions, which of the following statements most accurately resolves the classification of the Portuguese man o' war with respect to eusociality?\n\nA. The Portuguese man o' war is not eusocial because the zooids, being genetically identical and physically connected parts of a single colonial body, are not analogous to the separate, individual organisms that form a eusocial society.\n\nB. The Portuguese man o' war is eusocial because the clear division of labor between reproductive gonozooids and non-reproductive dactylozooids and gastrozooids perfectly fulfills the criterion of a reproductive caste system.\n\nC. The Portuguese man o' war is not eusocial because all zooids are produced asexually from the same founding larva, meaning they belong to the same generation, which violates the \"overlapping generations\" criterion.\n\nD. The Portuguese man o' war is eusocial because the coordinated function of its different zooids for hunting, defense, and digestion is a form of advanced cooperative behavior, a key feature of eusociality.", "solution": "We begin by restating the standard definition of eusociality used in biology. A species is considered eusocial if its members meet all three of the following criteria: (i) reproductive division of labor with a worker caste showing sterility or greatly reduced fertility assisting a reproductive caste; (ii) overlapping generations, in which offspring remain with and assist parents; and (iii) cooperative care of the young (brood). Importantly, these criteria are defined for societies composed of multiple, separate, conspecific individuals forming a social group, as in ants, bees, termites, and certain mammals.\n\nNext, we analyze the biological organization of the Portuguese man o' war (Physalia physalis). A single colony originates from one fertilized egg and grows by budding into a set of zooids (pneumatophore, dactylozooids, gastrozooids, gonozooids) that are genetically identical, permanently integrated, and unable to survive independently. Such a colony is a single genetic individual (a modular organism), with zooids functionally analogous to organs rather than autonomous organisms. Therefore, applying eusociality—defined for societies of separate individuals—to this within-body division of labor is a category error.\n\nWe now evaluate the options against the definition and the organism’s biology:\n\n- Option A asserts that the Portuguese man o’ war is not eusocial because its zooids are integrated parts of one colonial body rather than separate individuals in a society. This matches the key conceptual boundary: eusociality concerns social organization among multiple individuals, not division of labor within a single organism. Additionally, the man o’ war does not exhibit cooperative brood care in the social sense—gonozooids broadcast gametes; there is no worker-mediated care of offspring as separate individuals. Hence, A is accurate and most precise.\n\n- Option B claims eusociality based on reproductive division of labor between gonozooids and non-reproductive zooids. While there is a division of labor, it occurs among integrated modules of one organism rather than among separate individuals forming a society. Moreover, eusociality requires all three criteria, including overlapping generations and cooperative brood care among individuals, which are not met. Thus, B is incorrect.\n\n- Option C argues non-eusociality due to lack of overlapping generations because all zooids derive asexually from the founding larva and belong to the same generation. This rationale misapplies the “overlapping generations” criterion, which refers to multiple generations of autonomous individuals cohabiting and cooperating (e.g., parents and adult offspring). In Physalia, zooids are modules of one individual; “generations” in this social sense do not apply. While the conclusion “not eusocial” is correct, the stated reason is not the correct or most accurate justification, so C is not the best answer.\n\n- Option D infers eusociality from coordinated function among zooids. However, such coordination is physiological integration within one organism, not cooperative behavior among multiple individuals in a social group. Furthermore, eusociality requires all three criteria among individuals, which are not satisfied. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate resolution is that the Portuguese man o’ war is not eusocial because its zooids are parts of a single organism rather than separate individuals forming a eusocial society. This corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1846609"}, {"introduction": "A central puzzle in evolution is the existence of altruism, where sterile individuals sacrifice their own reproduction to help others. The theory of kin selection provides a powerful explanation, suggesting that altruism can evolve if the beneficiaries are close relatives. This practice [@problem_id:1846608] delves into the genetic engine of eusociality by having you calculate the coefficient of relatedness ($r$) in a haplodiploid system, which is characteristic of many eusocial insects like honeybees. Mastering this calculation is a fundamental step toward understanding how the seemingly selfless behavior of worker bees can be favored by natural selection.", "problem": "In a colony of honeybees (*Apis mellifera*), a process known as queen supersedure occurs, where an old queen is replaced by one of her daughters. This event alters the genetic fabric of the colony's leadership. Honeybees exhibit a haplodiploid sex-determination system: females (workers and queens) are diploid, developing from fertilized eggs, while males (drones) are haploid, developing from unfertilized eggs.\n\nAssume the original queen was monandrous, meaning she mated with only a single drone. One of her daughters develops into a new queen and takes over the colony. Considering this new queen and one of her brothers (a drone produced by the old queen), calculate the new queen's coefficient of relatedness to her brother. The coefficient of relatedness between two individuals is defined as the probability that a gene randomly sampled from one individual is an identical copy, by descent, of a gene in the other individual.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "We are to compute the coefficient of relatedness $r$ between the new queen (a diploid daughter of the old queen and a single drone father) and her brother (a haploid drone produced by the old queen from an unfertilized egg). By definition, $r$ is the probability that a gene randomly sampled from the queen is identical by descent to the gene in the brother.\n\nAt a locus, the new queen has two alleles: one maternal (from the old queen) and one paternal (from the drone father). The brother has a single allele derived from the old queen. The paternal allele of the new queen cannot be identical by descent to the brother’s allele because the brother has no paternal contribution and the father is unrelated to the mother in the pedigree. Therefore, only the queen’s maternal allele can match the brother’s allele.\n\nUsing the law of total probability:\n- The probability that a randomly sampled allele from the queen is the maternal allele is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Conditional on sampling the maternal allele from the queen, the probability that it is identical by descent to the brother’s allele is $\\frac{1}{2}$, because both independently inherit one of the old queen’s two alleles at that locus.\n\nHence,\n$$\nr \\;=\\; \\Pr(\\text{maternal allele from queen}) \\cdot \\Pr(\\text{match} \\mid \\text{maternal}) \\;+\\; \\Pr(\\text{paternal allele from queen}) \\cdot \\Pr(\\text{match} \\mid \\text{paternal})\n$$\n$$\n=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\;+\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 0 \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nExpressed as a decimal to two significant figures, this is $0.25$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.25}$$", "id": "1846608"}, {"introduction": "Once a eusocial colony is established, how does it function so efficiently without any central command? This question shifts our focus from the ultimate (evolutionary) causes of eusociality to its proximate (mechanistic) workings.

By applying a mathematical model to a hypothetical ant colony, you will gain hands-on experience with how self-organization can create a highly structured and effective society.", "problem": "In the study of eusocial insects, the \"response threshold model\" is a widely accepted framework for explaining division of labor within a colony. This model posits that individual workers possess different internal thresholds for specific stimuli, and an individual will only perform a task when the corresponding stimulus level exceeds its personal threshold.\n\nConsider a hypothetical ant colony being studied for its undertaking behavior (the removal of corpses from the nest).
