Consider a simplified model of blood-sharing in a colony of vampire bats, where fitness gains and losses are quantified in abstract 'energy units'. The cost to a donor bat for sharing a blood meal is denoted by $c$. The benefit to the recipient, which is often near starvation, is denoted by $b$.\n\nNow, consider a single interaction sequence between two unrelated bats, Bat A and Bat B. Bat A is known to be a 'cooperator' and initiates the sequence by sharing its meal with Bat B. Bat B, however, does not always reciprocate. For any given act of kindness it receives, the probability that Bat B will reciprocate in a future encounter is $p$. Assume the act of reciprocation, if it occurs, involves the same cost and benefit values.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- Cost of donation, $c = 8$ energy units\n- Benefit of reception, $b = 30$ energy units\n- Probability of reciprocation, $p = 0.75$\n\nCalculate the expected net fitness change for Bat A and the expected net fitness change for Bat B from this entire interaction sequence, which is initiated by Bat A.
