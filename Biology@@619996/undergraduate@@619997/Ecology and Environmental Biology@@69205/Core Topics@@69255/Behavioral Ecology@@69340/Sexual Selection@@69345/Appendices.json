In many species, a few individuals achieve a disproportionate number of matings, creating intense selective pressure. This practice will guide you through quantifying this phenomenon in a classic example of sexual selection—the sage grouse lek—by calculating an index of mating skew, providing a concrete measure for the strength of selection. [@problem_id:1880228]", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the intensity of sexual selection in a greater sage grouse (*Centrocercus urophasianus*) lek. In this mating system, males gather at a traditional display site (the lek) where they perform elaborate courtship displays. Females visit the lek, assess the males, and choose a mate. Consequently, a small number of males typically achieve the majority of copulations. To quantify this uneven distribution of reproductive success, the ecologist proposes an \"Index of Mating Skew\" ($I_m$), which is a standardized measure of the variance in mating success. The index is defined as:\n$$I_m = \\frac{V}{\\bar{x}^2}$$\nwhere $V$ is the population variance in the number of matings per male, and $\\bar{x}$ is the mean number of matings per male.\n\nThe ecologist observed the lek over the entire breeding season and recorded the number of successful matings for each of the 10 males present.

Two of the most influential hypotheses are Fisherian runaway, which posits that females choose mates who will produce 'sexy sons,' and the good genes model, which suggests chosen males provide genetic benefits for offspring viability. This conceptual problem asks you to analyze a hypothetical experiment and identify the key evidence that would distinguish between these fundamental mechanisms of indirect selection. [@problem_id:1880211]", "problem": "An ecologist is studying sexual selection in a hypothetical species of songbird where males possess long, ornamental tail streamers, and females consistently prefer to mate with males that have the longest streamers. To investigate the evolutionary mechanism driving this preference, the ecologist conducts a large-scale breeding experiment. Females are mated with either long-tailed (attractive) or short-tailed (unattractive) males. The resulting offspring are then tracked throughout their lives to measure key fitness components.\n\nThe two leading hypotheses for the evolution of the female preference are:\n1.  **Fisherian Runaway Selection**: The preference is arbitrary, but a genetic correlation has developed between the female preference and the male trait, leading to a self-reinforcing \"runaway\" process where sons of preferred males are simply more attractive (\"sexy sons\"), inheriting the trait from their fathers.\n2.  **Good Genes Selection**: The tail streamers are an honest indicator of a male's underlying genetic quality (e.g., parasite resistance, metabolic efficiency). By choosing males with long streamers, females produce offspring (both sons and daughters) that inherit these \"good genes\" and thus have higher intrinsic fitness.\n\nWhich of the following potential experimental outcomes would provide the strongest evidence for the good genes model as the primary explanation over the Fisherian runaway model?\n\nA. Daughters sired by long-tailed males exhibit higher fledgling survival rates and lay larger clutches of eggs as adults, compared to daughters sired by short-tailed males.\n\nB. Sons sired by long-tailed males are themselves more likely to be chosen as mates by females in the next generation.\n\nC. A strong positive genetic correlation is found between the length of a male's tail streamers and the strength of his daughters' preference for long streamers.\n\nD. The long tail streamers are shown to be metabolically costly to produce and result in a slight decrease in the male's own foraging efficiency.\n\nE. Females that mate with long-tailed males receive no direct benefits, such as access to a better territory, more food, or increased paternal care for the offspring.", "solution": "I identify the predictions that distinguish the two models. Under Fisherian runaway selection, the main expected benefit to females is indirect via producing sons with higher mating success because the male trait and female preference are genetically correlated. This model does not require intrinsic viability advantages; daughters may inherit preference, but their survival or fecundity need not improve. Under the good genes model, the ornament is an honest indicator of genetic quality, so mating with long-tailed males yields offspring with higher intrinsic fitness. A key discriminating prediction is that daughters—who do not benefit from increased attractiveness to the same extent as sons—should show improved viability and fecundity if good genes are at work.\n\nI evaluate each option against these predictions.\n\nOption A reports that daughters of long-tailed males have higher fledgling survival and lay larger clutches as adults. These are intrinsic fitness components independent of mating attractiveness. Improved viability and fecundity in daughters are a hallmark of good genes effects because these benefits arise from inherited genetic quality rather than from attractiveness. This pattern is not required under Fisherian runaway and directly supports the good genes model over it.\n\nOption B reports that sons of long-tailed males are more likely to be chosen. This is the classic “sexy sons” prediction of Fisherian runaway. Although it could also occur under good genes, it does not discriminate in favor of good genes and aligns most directly with Fisherian dynamics.\n\nOption C reports a strong positive genetic correlation between male tail length and daughters’ preference strength. This is a definitive expectation of Fisherian runaway, not of good genes, and would support Fisherian over good genes.\n\nOption D shows the ornament is costly. Costliness is consistent with handicap-based honesty, which is a component often associated with good genes, but cost alone does not demonstrate that offspring receive viability benefits. Without showing increased offspring fitness, this does not strongly favor good genes over Fisherian.\n\nOption E indicates no direct benefits. This rules out direct-benefit models but does not distinguish between Fisherian runaway and good genes, as both are indirect-benefit models.\n\nTherefore, the outcome that most strongly supports the good genes model over Fisherian runaway is improved intrinsic fitness in daughters of long-tailed males, which is described in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1880211"}]}
