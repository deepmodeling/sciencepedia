A foundational skill is converting survivorship proportions ($l_x$) back into the absolute number of individuals. This exercise demonstrates how to calculate the number of deaths ($d_x$) for a specific age class using the initial cohort size ($n_0$) and survivorship values, bridging the gap between proportional data and concrete demographic events [@problem_id:1860326].", "id": "1860326", "problem": "An ecologist is constructing a cohort life table for a population of a rare biennial plant species. The study began by tracking a cohort of 500 newly germinated seedlings, which are considered to be in age class $x=0$. In life table terminology, $n_x$ represents the number of individuals surviving to the start of age class $x$, and $l_x$ represents survivorship, which is the proportion of the original cohort that survives to the start of age class $x$.\n\nAfter two years of data collection, the ecologist determined that the survivorship to the start of the second year (age class $x=2$) is $l_2 = 0.40$. The survivorship to the start of the third year (age class $x=3$) is $l_3 = 0.30$.\n\nUsing this information, calculate the total number of individuals from the original cohort that are expected to die during the interval between the start of age class 2 and the start of age class 3.

This quantity is denoted as $d_2$ in a life table.\n\nThe number of deaths during an age interval $x$ to $x+1$, denoted $d_x$, is calculated as the difference between the number of individuals alive at the start of age class $x$ ($n_x$) and the number of individuals alive at the start of age class $x+1$ ($n_{x+1}$).\n$$d_x = n_x - n_{x+1}$$\nFor this problem, we need to find $d_2$:\n$$d_2 = n_2 - n_3$$\n\nFirst, we need to calculate $n_2$ and $n_3$. The number of individuals surviving to the start of any age class $x$, $n_x$, can be found by multiplying the survivorship for that age class, $l_x$, by the initial number of individuals in the cohort, $n_0$.\n$$n_x = l_x \\times n_0$$\n\nWe are given:\n- Initial cohort size, $n_0 = 500$.\n- Survivorship to the start of age class 2, $l_2 = 0.40$.\n- Survivorship to the start of age class 3, $l_3 = 0.30$.\n\nNow, we can calculate $n_2$, the number of individuals alive at the start of age class 2:\n$$n_2 = l_2 \\times n_0 = 0.40 \\times 500 = 200$$\nSo, 200 individuals are alive at the beginning of the second year interval.\n\nNext, we calculate $n_3$, the number of individuals alive at the start of age class 3:\n$$n_3 = l_3 \\times n_0 = 0.30 \\times 500 = 150$$\nSo, 150 individuals are alive at the beginning of the third year interval.\n\nFinally, we calculate $d_2$, the number of deaths between the start of age class 2 and the start of age class 3:\n$$d_2 = n_2 - n_3 = 200 - 150 = 50$$\n\nTherefore, 50 individuals from the cohort are expected to die during the age interval from $x=2$ to $x=3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{50}$$"}, {"introduction": "Understanding *when* mortality occurs is as important as knowing *how many* die.
