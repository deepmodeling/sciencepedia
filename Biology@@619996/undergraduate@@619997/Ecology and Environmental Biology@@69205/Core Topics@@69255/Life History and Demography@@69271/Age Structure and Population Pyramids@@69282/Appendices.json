One of the most direct ways to assess the potential economic burden on the working population is by calculating the dependency ratio. This first exercise [@problem_id:1829945] will guide you through calculating this fundamental metric, providing a quantitative snapshot of a population's balance between its productive and dependent members.", "problem": "Two isolated, self-sufficient communities, Veridia and Solara, have been studied by sociologists to understand their long-term stability. The sociologists have collected demographic data, categorizing the populations into three key age groups: children and young adolescents (0-14 years), the primary working-age population (15-64 years), and seniors (65+ years).\n\nThe population breakdown for each community is as follows:\n- **Veridia**:\n    - Population aged 0-14 years: 1,250\n    - Population aged 15-64 years: 3,500\n    - Population aged 65+ years: 950\n- **Solara**:\n    - Population aged 0-14 years: 2,800\n    - Population aged 15-64 years: 4,100\n    - Population aged 65+ years: 320\n\nTo assess the potential economic burden on the productive members of a society, demographers often calculate a specific metric. For the community of Veridia, calculate the ratio of the combined population of individuals in the typically non-working age groups (0-14 years and 65+ years) to the population of individuals in the primary working-age group (15-64 years).\n\nExpress your answer as a numerical value rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We interpret the requested metric as the ratio of the combined population in the typically non-working age groups to the population in the primary working-age group.

The city attracts a massive influx of students from other regions every year. However, due to limited high-skilled job opportunities locally, a phenomenon known as \"brain drain\" occurs, where a vast majority of graduates leave UniverCity shortly after completing their degrees to seek employment elsewhere. The permanent resident population of the city has a low birth rate.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions best characterizes the most likely shape of UniverCity's age-structure pyramid?\n\nA. A classic expansive pyramid with a very broad base that tapers uniformly and smoothly towards the top, indicating a high birth rate and a young, growing population.\n\nB. A constrictive or \"beehive\" shape, with a narrow base and a bulge in the 45-55 year old age cohorts, indicating an aging population with low birth and death rates.\n\nC. A pyramid with a narrow base, a dramatic bulge in the 15-24 year old age cohort, followed by a sharp indentation or \"neck\" in the 25-34 year old cohort, and then tapering in the older age groups.\n\nD.

Each fertile Adult produces, on average, $F_A = 2.0$ offspring (Juveniles) per year.\n\nAt $t=0$, a non-lethal pathogen is introduced into the environment. The pathogen exclusively infects Juveniles. Each year, a fraction $p=0.3$ of the total Juvenile population becomes infected. This infection is permanent and causes complete sterility, but it does not alter the survival rates ($S_J$ or $S_A$). An individual infected as a Juvenile will thus survive to become a sterile Adult. The pathogen's effect begins with the cohort of Juveniles present at $t=0$. All Adults in the initial population at $t=0$ are fertile.\n\nCalculate the aged dependency ratio of the population at time $t=3$ years.
