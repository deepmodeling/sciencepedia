{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the structure of a population often begins with quantifying its composition. The tertiary sex ratio—the proportion of sexually mature males to females—is a crucial indicator of a population's reproductive potential and social dynamics. This first exercise provides a practical application of this concept, allowing you to calculate the tertiary sex ratio from hypothetical field survey data, a fundamental skill for any ecologist studying population structure [@problem_id:1879981].", "problem": "Ecologists are conducting a field study to assess the population structure of a newly discovered species of songbird, the \"Garnet-throated Finch,\" on a remote tropical island. The sex ratio of the mature, reproductive-age individuals in a population is referred to as the tertiary sex ratio. As part of their survey, the research team captured and carefully sampled a portion of the mature finch population. Their sample consisted of 137 mature females and 59 mature males.\n\nBased on this sample, calculate the tertiary sex ratio, expressed as the proportion of males in the sampled adult population.

Although evolutionary pressures often favor a 1:1 ratio, some genetic elements can distort this balance through a process known as meiotic drive. This thought experiment explores a hypothetical \"driving\" chromosome to illustrate how such genetic conflicts can fundamentally alter the proportion of males and females produced in the next generation, offering insight into the genetic underpinnings of sex ratio evolution [@problem_id:1879938].", "problem": "In many species, including the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, sex is determined by the XY chromosome system, where females are XX and males are XY. Typically, a male produces sperm containing either an X or a Y chromosome in a 1:1 ratio. However, certain genetic elements can subvert this fairness, a phenomenon known as meiotic drive.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario involving a \"driving\" X chromosome, denoted as $X_D$. When a male fruit fly with the genotype $X_D Y$ undergoes meiosis to produce sperm, this driving chromosome ensures it is passed on to 80% of the resulting functional sperm cells. Assume these males mate with a population of standard females with a normal XX genotype.\n\nCalculate the primary sex ratio of the subsequent generation, defined as the expected proportion of males among all zygotes at the moment of conception. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Sex in an XY system is determined by which sex chromosome the sperm contributes: an X-bearing sperm with a maternal X yields an XX (female) zygote, and a Y-bearing sperm with a maternal X yields an XY (male) zygote.\n\nGiven a male with genotype $X_{D}Y$ whose driving $X_{D}$ is transmitted to a fraction $0.8$ of functional sperm, the gamete distribution from such a male is:\n$$\nP(\\text{sperm }=X_{D})=0.8, \\quad P(\\text{sperm }=Y)=1-0.8=0.2.\n$$\nStandard females (XX) produce only X-bearing eggs.\n\nAt fertilization:\n- With probability $0.8$, an $X$ egg meets an $X_{D}$ sperm to form an $XX$ zygote (female).\n- With probability $0.2$, an $X$ egg meets a $Y$ sperm to form an $XY$ zygote (male).\n\nTherefore, the primary sex ratio, defined as the proportion of males among all zygotes at conception, is\n$$\nP(\\text{male})=P(\\text{sperm }=Y)=0.2.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2}$$", "id": "1879938"}, {"introduction": "The journey from a primary sex ratio at conception to a tertiary sex ratio in adulthood is shaped by the different life history paths of males and females. Sex-specific differences in survival rates and reproductive longevity can cause the adult sex ratio to deviate significantly from what is observed at birth.

The annual survival probability for a female is a constant $S_F$, while for a male it is a constant $S_M$.\n\nBoth sexes become sexually mature at the beginning of their second year of life (age 1). A key difference in their life history is observed: females remain fertile for their entire lifespan, while males become permanently sterile after their fifth year of life.
