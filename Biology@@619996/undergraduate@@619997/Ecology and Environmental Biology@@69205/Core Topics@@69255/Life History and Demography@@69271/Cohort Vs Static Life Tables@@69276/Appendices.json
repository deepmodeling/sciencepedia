Ecologists often turn to static life tables, which offer a \"snapshot\" of the population's age structure at a single point in time, but this method rests on a critical assumption: a stable age distribution. This problem presents a common scenario where this assumption is violated, leading to a biologically impossible result, forcing you to think critically about the limitations of your tools and the importance of underlying assumptions in ecological analysis [@problem_id:1835582].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the population dynamics of a sessile barnacle species, *Semibalanus balanoides*, on a rocky intertidal shore. Due to the long lifespan of the barnacles, conducting a cohort life table (following individuals from birth to death) is impractical. Instead, the ecologist decides to construct a static life table by taking a \"snapshot\" of the population at a single point in time. The age of each barnacle is determined by counting its annual growth ridges.\n\nFrom a representative sample, the ecologist records the number of individuals in the first few age classes:\n- Age class 0 (individuals aged 0 to 1 year): 350 individuals ($N_0$)\n- Age class 1 (individuals aged 1 to 2 years): 420 individuals ($N_1$)\n- Age class 2 (individuals aged 2 to 3 years): 280 individuals ($N_2$)\n\nThe ecologist begins to calculate the survivorship schedule ($l_x$), defined as the proportion of the original cohort that is still alive at the beginning of age class $x$. An anomalous result is found for $l_1$.\n\nWhich of the following multiple-choice options provides the most scientifically plausible explanation for this anomalous result?\n\nA. In static life tables, it is expected for survivorship to temporarily exceed 1.0 during periods of rapid population growth, before declining in older age classes.\n\nB. The barnacles in Age Class 1 must have undergone asexual fission, which increased their numbers after their initial settlement on the rock.\n\nC. A simple calculation error was made, where the number of individuals in age class 0 ($N_0$) was divided by the number in age class 1 ($N_1$) to find $l_1$.\n\nD. The fundamental assumption of a static life table, that the population has a stable age distribution, has been violated due to immigration or past fluctuations in reproductive success.\n\nE. The method for aging the barnacles systematically overestimates the age of the youngest individuals, incorrectly assigning many from Age Class 0 into Age Class 1.", "solution": "Define survivorship as a cohort-based probability: for a true cohort life table, $l_{x}$ is the proportion of the original cohort alive at the beginning of age class $x$, with $l_{0}=1$ and $0 \\leq l_{x} \\leq 1$ for all $x$. Under a cohort approach one would compute $l_{x}=N_{x}/N_{0}$, where $N_{x}$ is the number of individuals from the original cohort alive at the start of age class $x$. Applying this naive computation to the snapshot counts gives $l_{1}=N_{1}/N_{0}=420/350=6/5>1$, which violates the fundamental bound $0 \\leq l_{x} \\leq 1$. This is the anomalous result.\n\nIn a static life table, however, $N_{x}$ are cross-sectional counts rather than members of a single cohort. Interpreting $N_{x}/N_{0}$ as survivorship is only valid if the population has a stable (and, for direct proportionality, stationary) age distribution with constant vital rates and no net migration; otherwise, age-class abundances conflate survivorship with differences in cohort size and movement. Thus, if the assumption of a stable age distribution is violated by immigration or temporal variability in recruitment (past fluctuations in reproductive success), one can observe $N_{1}>N_{0}$ even though true survivorship cannot exceed $1$.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is false because survivorship is a probability and cannot exceed $1$, regardless of population growth; growth affects age structure, not the probabilistic bound on $l_{x}$.\n- B is biologically implausible for Semibalanus balanoides, which does not increase numbers via asexual fission after settlement.\n- C is inconsistent with the anomaly: dividing $N_{0}$ by $N_{1}$ would yield $l_{1}=\\frac{350}{420}<1$, not an anomalously high value.\n- D correctly identifies the key issue: a static life table relies on a stable age distribution; violations due to immigration or variable recruitment produce cross-sectional $N_{x}$ that do not reflect cohort survivorship and can yield $N_{1}>N_{0}$.\n- E could, in principle, inflate $N_{1}$ at the expense of $N_{0}$, but it requires a systematic aging bias. Given the standard use of growth ridges and the central importance of the stable age distribution assumption in static life tables, demographic instability (D) is the more scientifically plausible and general explanation.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is the violation of the stable age distribution assumption in a static life table (option D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1835582"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how a static life table can produce misleading results when its core assumptions are not met, we now move from diagnosis to solution.

From this static survey data, an *apparent survivorship* schedule is calculated as the ratio $S_x = N_x / N_0$, where $N_0$ is the number of individuals in the youngest age class (age 0).\n\nIndependent long-term monitoring has established that the population has been experiencing exponential change with a constant intrinsic rate of increase, $r$, for a sufficient duration to have achieved a stable age distribution.
