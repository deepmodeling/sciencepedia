Due to its slow life cycle, direct observation of its generation time is impractical. Instead, the researchers have compiled demographic data over several decades to estimate key population parameters. They have determined that the net reproductive rate, defined as the average number of female offspring produced by a female over her entire lifespan, is $R_0 = 2.0$. The intrinsic rate of increase for this population, which represents the per capita growth rate under ideal conditions, has been estimated as $r = 0.010$ per year.\n\nA common approximation in population ecology relates these two parameters to the mean generation time, $T$, which is the average age of the parents of all offspring in a cohort.

It is a critical parameter for understanding population dynamics. For a species with discrete age classes, $T_c$ is defined by the formula:\n\n$$T_c = \\frac{\\sum_{x=0}^{\\omega} x l_x m_x}{\\sum_{x=0}^{\\omega} l_x m_x}$$\n\nwhere $x$ is the age class, $\\omega$ is the maximum age, $l_x$ is the probability of an individual surviving from birth to age $x$, and $m_x$ is the average number of female offspring produced by a female of age $x$.\n\nConsider a simplified model for a species where individuals can live to a maximum age of $\\omega=3$. They are immature at age $x=0$ ($m_0=0$) and reproduce at ages $x=1, 2,$ and $3$.

We need to compare $|E_{m_1}|$ and $|E_{l_3}|$.\n\nFirst, let's write the explicit formula for $T_c$ for the given life history model. The species reproduces at ages $x=1, 2, 3$, so the sums in the formula for $T_c$ run over these age classes.\n\nThe numerator is $\\sum x l_x m_x = 1 \\cdot l_1 m_1 + 2 \\cdot l_2 m_2 + 3 \\cdot l_3 m_3$.\nThe denominator is the net reproductive rate, $R_0 = \\sum l_x m_x = l_1 m_1 + l_2 m_2 + l_3 m_3$.\n\nSo, the expression for $T_c$ is:\n$$T_c = \\frac{l_1 m_1 + 2 l_2 m_2 + 3 l_3 m_3}{l_1 m_1 + l_2 m_2 + l_3 m_3}$$\n\nTo simplify calculations, let's use the notation $S_1 = l_1 m_1 + 2 l_2 m_2 + 3 l_3 m_3$ and $R_0 = l_1 m_1 + l_2 m_2 + l_3 m_3$, so $T_c = S_1/R_0$.\n\nThe elasticity of $T_c$ with respect to a variable $y$ is given by $E_y = \\frac{\\partial T_c}{\\partial y} \\frac{y}{T_c}$.\n\nLet's first calculate the elasticity with respect to $m_1$, $E_{m_1}$. We need the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial T_c}{\\partial m_1}$.\nUsing the quotient rule:\n$\\frac{\\partial T_c}{\\partial m_1} = \\frac{(\\frac{\\partial S_1}{\\partial m_1})R_0 - S_1(\\frac{\\partial R_0}{\\partial m_1})}{R_0^2}$.\nHere, $\\frac{\\partial S_1}{\\partial m_1} = l_1$ and $\\frac{\\partial R_0}{\\partial m_1} = l_1$.\n$\\frac{\\partial T_c}{\\partial m_1} = \\frac{l_1 R_0 - S_1 l_1}{R_0^2} = \\frac{l_1 (R_0 - S_1)}{R_0^2}$.\nSubstituting $S_1 = T_c R_0$:\n$\\frac{\\partial T_c}{\\partial m_1} = \\frac{l_1 (R_0 - T_c R_0)}{R_0^2} = \\frac{l_1 (1 - T_c)}{R_0}$.\nNow we can write the elasticity $E_{m_1}$:\n$E_{m_1} = \\frac{\\partial T_c}{\\partial m_1} \\frac{m_1}{T_c} = \\frac{l_1(1-T_c)}{R_0} \\frac{m_1}{T_c} = \\frac{l_1 m_1 (1 - T_c)}{R_0 T_c}$.\nSince $T_c$ is the average age of reproduction, which occurs at ages 1, 2, and 3, we know that $1 < T_c < 3$. Therefore, $(1-T_c)$ is negative, and so is $E_{m_1}$. The magnitude is $|E_{m_1}| = \\frac{l_1 m_1 (T_c - 1)}{R_0 T_c}$.\n\nNext, let's calculate the elasticity with respect to $l_3$, $E_{l_3}$. We need the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial T_c}{\\partial l_3}$.\n$\\frac{\\partial T_c}{\\partial l_3} = \\frac{(\\frac{\\partial S_1}{\\partial l_3})R_0 - S_1(\\frac{\\partial R_0}{\\partial l_3})}{R_0^2}$.\nHere, $\\frac{\\partial S_1}{\\partial l_3} = 3m_3$ and $\\frac{\\partial R_0}{\\partial l_3} = m_3$.\n$\\frac{\\partial T_c}{\\partial l_3} = \\frac{3m_3 R_0 - S_1 m_3}{R_0^2} = \\frac{m_3 (3R_0 - S_1)}{R_0^2}$.\nSubstituting $S_1 = T_c R_0$:\n$\\frac{\\partial T_c}{\\partial l_3} = \\frac{m_3 (3R_0 - T_c R_0)}{R_0^2} = \\frac{m_3 (3 - T_c)}{R_0}$.\nNow we can write the elasticity $E_{l_3}$:\n$E_{l_3} = \\frac{\\partial T_c}{\\partial l_3} \\frac{l_3}{T_c} = \\frac{m_3(3-T_c)}{R_0} \\frac{l_3}{T_c} = \\frac{l_3 m_3 (3 - T_c)}{R_0 T_c}$.\nSince $1 < T_c < 3$, $(3-T_c)$ is positive, and so is $E_{l_3}$. The magnitude is $|E_{l_3}| = \\frac{l_3 m_3 (3 - T_c)}{R_0 T_c}$.\n\nNow we compare the magnitudes. We want to find the condition for $|E_{m_1}| > |E_{l_3}|$.\n$$\\frac{l_1 m_1 (T_c - 1)}{R_0 T_c} > \\frac{l_3 m_3 (3 - T_c)}{R_0 T_c}$$\nSince all parameters are positive, $R_0 > 0$ and $T_c > 0$. We can cancel the common denominator $R_0 T_c$:\n$$l_1 m_1 (T_c - 1) > l_3 m_3 (3 - T_c)$$\nNow, we substitute the full expression for $T_c$:\n$T_c - 1 = \\frac{l_1 m_1 + 2 l_2 m_2 + 3 l_3 m_3}{l_1 m_1 + l_2 m_2 + l_3 m_3} - 1 = \\frac{(l_1 m_1 + 2 l_2 m_2 + 3 l_3 m_3) - (l_1 m_1 + l_2 m_2 + l_3 m_3)}{R_0} = \\frac{l_2 m_2 + 2 l_3 m_3}{R_0}$.\n$3 - T_c = 3 - \\frac{l_1 m_1 + 2 l_2 m_2 + 3 l_3 m_3}{l_1 m_1 + l_2 m_2 + l_3 m_3} = \\frac{3(l_1 m_1 + l_2 m_2 + l_3 m_3) - (l_1 m_1 + 2 l_2 m_2 + 3 l_3 m_3)}{R_0} = \\frac{2 l_1 m_1 + l_2 m_2}{R_0}$.\n\nSubstituting these back into the inequality:\n$$l_1 m_1 \\left( \\frac{l_2 m_2 + 2 l_3 m_3}{R_0} \\right) > l_3 m_3 \\left( \\frac{2 l_1 m_1 + l_2 m_2}{R_0} \\right)$$\nMultiply by $R_0$ (which is positive):\n$$l_1 m_1 (l_2 m_2 + 2 l_3 m_3) > l_3 m_3 (2 l_1 m_1 + l_2 m_2)$$\nExpand both sides:\n$$l_1 m_1 l_2 m_2 + 2 l_1 m_1 l_3 m_3 > 2 l_1 m_1 l_3 m_3 + l_2 m_2 l_3 m_3$$\nSubtract the common term $2 l_1 m_1 l_3 m_3$ from both sides:\n$$l_1 m_1 l_2 m_2 > l_2 m_2 l_3 m_3$$\nSince $l_2 > 0$ and $m_2 > 0$, we can divide both sides by $l_2 m_2$ without changing the inequality direction:\n$$l_1 m_1 > l_3 m_3$$\nThis is the condition under which the magnitude of the elasticity of $T_c$ with respect to $m_1$ is greater than its magnitude with respect to $l_3$.
