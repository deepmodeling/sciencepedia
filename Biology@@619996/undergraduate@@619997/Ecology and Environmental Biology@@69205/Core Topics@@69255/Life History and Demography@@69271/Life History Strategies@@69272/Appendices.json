This plant completes its entire life cycle in a few months following seasonal rains. By tracking a cohort of 1000 seeds from germination, the ecologist compiled the following data. The age class, $x$, is measured in months. The term $n_x$ represents the number of individuals from the original cohort that are still alive at the start of age class $x$. The term $m_x$ represents the average number of seeds (offspring) produced by an individual plant during the age interval $x$.\n\nThe collected data is as follows:\n- Age 0 ($x=0$): $n_0=1000$, $m_0=0$\n- Age 1 ($x=1$): $n_1=200$, $m_1=0$\n- Age 2 ($x=2$): $n_2=100$, $m_2=5$\n- Age 3 ($x=3$): $n_3=50$, $m_3=20$\n- Age 4 ($x=4$): $n_4=10$, $m_4=10$\n- At the beginning of age 5 ($x=5$), no individuals from the cohort remain.\n\nBased on this life table data, calculate the population's net reproductive rate, $R_0$, and its mean generation time, $T$.

This practice challenges you to move beyond simple calculation and engage with mathematical modeling to explore such a trade-off. By defining a fitness function and using optimization, you will determine the ideal resource allocation strategy for a hypothetical organism, providing insight into how natural selection shapes these fundamental life decisions [@problem_id:1860134].", "problem": "A species of understory tree faces a fundamental life-history trade-off. In its juvenile stage, it must allocate its limited metabolic resources between two competing functions: (1) vertical growth to compete for light and increase its probability of surviving to maturity, and (2) early reproductive effort (e.g., producing cones or flowers). An ecologist proposes a model to understand the optimal allocation strategy.\n\nLet $x$ be the fraction of available resources allocated to vertical growth, such that $0 \\le x \\le 1$. The remaining fraction, $(1-x)$, is allocated to reproduction. The model makes the following assumptions:\n\n1.  The probability of the tree surviving to maturity, $P_S$, is dependent on the investment in growth. This relationship is modeled by the function $P_S(x) = C_S x^{\\alpha}$, where $C_S$ is a positive scaling constant and $\\alpha > 0$ is the \"growth-to-survival\" sensitivity parameter. A higher $\\alpha$ indicates a more intense competitive environment where growth is critically important for survival.\n\n2.  The reproductive output of the tree, measured as the number of viable seeds produced, $N_R$, depends on the resources allocated to it. This is modeled by the function $N_R(x) = C_R (1-x)^{\\beta}$, where $C_R$ is a positive scaling constant and $\\beta > 0$ is the \"reproduction efficiency\" parameter.\n\nThe overall evolutionary fitness of a given strategy is measured by the Lifetime Reproductive Success, $W(x)$, defined as the expected total number of viable seeds produced over the tree's life. This is calculated as the product of the probability of surviving to maturity and the reproductive output at maturity.\n\nDetermine the optimal fraction of resources, $x_{opt}$, that the tree should allocate to vertical growth to maximize its Lifetime Reproductive Success $W(x)$. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.", "solution": "The goal is to find the value of $x$ that maximizes the Lifetime Reproductive Success, $W(x)$. First, we must construct the function for $W(x)$ based on the problem description.\n\nThe Lifetime Reproductive Success, $W(x)$, is defined as the product of the survival probability, $P_S(x)$, and the reproductive output, $N_R(x)$.\n$$W(x) = P_S(x) \\times N_R(x)$$\n\nSubstituting the given model functions for $P_S(x)$ and $N_R(x)$:\n$$P_S(x) = C_S x^{\\alpha}$$\n$$N_R(x) = C_R (1-x)^{\\beta}$$\n\nWe get the expression for $W(x)$:\n$$W(x) = (C_S x^{\\alpha}) \\times (C_R (1-x)^{\\beta})$$\n$$W(x) = C_S C_R x^{\\alpha} (1-x)^{\\beta}$$\n\nTo find the optimal allocation fraction $x_{opt}$ that maximizes $W(x)$, we need to use calculus.

Because $W(x)$ is positive for $x \\in (0,1)$, the function must have a maximum within this interval, and our critical point is the only one in the interval.
