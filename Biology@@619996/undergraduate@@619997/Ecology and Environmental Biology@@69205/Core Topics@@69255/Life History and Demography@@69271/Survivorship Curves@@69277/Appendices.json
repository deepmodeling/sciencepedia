This problem presents a counter-intuitive observation: life expectancy at age one ($e_1$) being greater than life expectancy at birth ($e_0$). Resolving this puzzle requires you to apply your knowledge of Type III survivorship, where surviving an initial high-risk period dramatically improves an individual's future prospects, a key concept in life history theory [@problem_id:2300176].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the population dynamics of a newly discovered species of marine invertebrate. By tracking a cohort of 100,000 individuals from birth, the ecologist constructs a life table to understand its life history strategy. In population ecology, life expectancy at age $x$, denoted as $e_x$, is formally defined as the average number of additional years an individual of age $x$ is expected to live. Upon analyzing the data, the ecologist observes a counter-intuitive result: the life expectancy for an individual that has survived to age 1 ($e_1$) is greater than the life expectancy at birth ($e_0$).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct ecological explanation for the observation that $e_1 > e_0$ and correctly identifies the associated feature of this species' survivorship curve?\n\nA. The species exhibits a Type II survivorship curve, where the mortality rate is constant across all age groups. This means that surviving the first year has no impact on future survival probability, but the mathematical removal of the first-year data point from the average calculation artificially inflates the life expectancy.\nB. The species invests heavily in parental care, leading to a Type I survivorship curve where most mortality occurs late in life. The observation is an anomaly caused by an unusual environmental event that only affected the cohort at birth.\nC. The species experiences a very high mortality rate during its larval or juvenile stage, corresponding to a steep initial drop in its survivorship curve. Individuals that survive this high-risk period have a much higher probability of reaching older ages, so their average remaining lifespan is greater than the initial average for the entire cohort at birth.\nD. The rate of senescence (biological aging) is negligible for the first year of life but increases sharply at age 1. This means individuals at age 1 are physiologically \"younger\" and have a longer future than individuals at birth, who are about to enter a period of rapid aging.\nE. The species has a life history strategy focused on high reproductive output early in life. This exhausts the individuals, but those that survive the first reproductive cycle are genetically superior and thus have a longer subsequent lifespan, which is reflected in a convex survivorship curve.", "solution": "Define the survivorship function $l(a)$ as the probability an individual is alive at exact age $a$, with $l(0)=1$ and $l(a)$ nonincreasing.
