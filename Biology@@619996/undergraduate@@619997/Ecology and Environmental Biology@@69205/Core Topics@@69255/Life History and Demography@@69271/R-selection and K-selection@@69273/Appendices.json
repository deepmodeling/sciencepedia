The environment is rich in nutrients but is highly transient, as the fruit will be fully decomposed or consumed by other organisms within a matter of days. The mold exhibits the following characteristics: it germinates from a spore and grows a visible mycelial network in under 24 hours, it produces millions of microscopic, lightweight spores that are dispersed by the wind, its entire life cycle is completed in 3-5 days, and there is no parental investment beyond the production of spores. The mortality rate for individual spores is extremely high.\n\n**Organism B** is a species of lichen found growing on a granite rock face in a high-altitude, cold desert environment. This environment is extremely stable over geological timescales but is nutrient-poor and subject to harsh weather. The lichen exhibits the following characteristics: it grows at an almost imperceptible rate of less than a millimeter per year, individuals can live for several hundred years, it reproduces infrequently, and when it does, it produces a small number of larger, more robust reproductive propagules that have a higher chance of establishing nearby. It invests heavily in chemical defenses to deter herbivores and withstand environmental stress.\n\nBased on the descriptions provided, which of the following statements most accurately classifies the life history strategies of Organism A and Organism B according to the r/K selection theory?\n\nA.

A fundamental trade-off exists between allocating energy to somatic growth (increasing body size) versus reproductive output.\n\nConsider a simplified model where an organism's lifetime discretionary energy is partitioned between total somatic growth and total reproduction. The total lifetime energy invested in growth, $E_G$, can be modeled as the product of its final adult body mass, $M$, and an energy density constant, $c$, representing the joules required to build one kilogram of tissue. The total lifetime energy invested in reproduction, $E_R$, is the product of the total number of offspring produced over a lifetime, $N$, the average mass of a single offspring at independence, $m$, and the same energy density constant, $c$.\n\nWe can define a dimensionless \"Lifetime Reproductive-to-Growth Investment Ratio\" as $R = \\frac{E_R}{E_G}$.

This simplifies the expression for $R$ to:\n$$R = \\frac{N m}{M}$$\n\nThis simplified expression shows that the investment ratio depends only on the number of offspring, the mass of an offspring, and the adult mass of the parent.\n\nNext, we calculate the investment ratio $R$ for the mouse ($R_{\\text{mouse}}$) using the data from the table.\nFor the mouse:\n$N_{\\text{mouse}} = 40$\n$m_{\\text{mouse}} = 0.0060$ kg\n$M_{\\text{mouse}} = 0.025$ kg\n\n$$R_{\\text{mouse}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{mouse}} m_{\\text{mouse}}}{M_{\\text{mouse}}} = \\frac{40 \\times 0.0060 \\text{ kg}}{0.025 \\text{ kg}} = \\frac{0.24}{0.025}$$\n$$R_{\\text{mouse}} = 9.6$$\n\nNow, we calculate the investment ratio $R$ for the elephant ($R_{\\text{elephant}}$) using the data from the table.\nFor the elephant:\n$N_{\\text{elephant}} = 8$\n$m_{\\text{elephant}} = 400$ kg\n$M_{\\text{elephant}} = 4500$ kg\n\n$$R_{\\text{elephant}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{elephant}} m_{\\text{elephant}}}{M_{\\text{elephant}}} = \\frac{8 \\times 400 \\text{ kg}}{4500 \\text{ kg}} = \\frac{3200}{4500} = \\frac{32}{45}$$\nAs a decimal, $R_{\\text{elephant}} \\approx 0.7111...$\n\nFinally, we calculate the required ratio, $\\frac{R_{\\text{mouse}}}{R_{\\text{elephant}}}$.\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{mouse}}}{R_{\\text{elephant}}} = \\frac{9.6}{\\frac{32}{45}} = 9.6 \\times \\frac{45}{32}$$\nWe can simplify the calculation:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{mouse}}}{R_{\\text{elephant}}} = \\frac{96}{10} \\times \\frac{45}{32} = \\frac{3 \\times 32}{10} \\times \\frac{45}{32} = \\frac{3}{10} \\times 45 = \\frac{135}{10} = 13.5$$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to three significant figures.

This exercise explores a compelling real-world example of fisheries-induced evolution, a major concern in conservation and resource management. You will act as an evolutionary ecologist, analyzing how intense, size-selective fishing acts as a powerful selective force that can favor a shift toward earlier maturation. [@problem_id:2300088]", "problem": "A population of a commercially valuable fish species, the \"Crimson Snapper,\" inhabits a large, remote marine ecosystem. Historically, this population has been subject only to natural predation and has exhibited a stable life history pattern where individuals reach sexual maturity at an average age of 5 years and a body length of 60 cm.\n\nRecently, a new, large-scale commercial fishery has been established in the area. The fishing method primarily uses gillnets with a mesh size that is most effective at catching fish larger than 55 cm. After a decade of sustained, intensive fishing pressure (equivalent to several generations for this species), marine biologists observe a significant shift in the population's characteristics. The average Crimson Snapper now reaches sexual maturity at an age of 3 years and a body length of 45 cm.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete evolutionary explanation for this observed change in the life history of the Crimson Snapper population?\n\nA. The fishing nets create a novel environmental barrier, leading to geographic isolation of different sub-populations. This genetic drift is the primary cause for the rapid shift in maturation traits.\n\nB. The stress induced by the constant presence of fishing gear and boats causes a hormonal response in the fish that accelerates their development. These acquired characteristics are then passed on to their offspring.\n\nC. The removal of large fish reduces competition for food and resources. The remaining smaller fish can therefore grow more quickly and reach a mature state at a younger age. This is a non-heritable, plastic response of the organism to improved environmental conditions.\n\nD. The high mortality rate imposed on larger, older individuals by the fishery creates a strong directional selection pressure. Fish with genetic predispositions for maturing earlier and at a smaller size have a significantly higher probability of reproducing before being caught, causing alleles for early maturation to increase in frequency in the population.\n\nE. The fishery has unintentionally removed the primary natural predators of the Crimson Snapper, which were also being caught in the nets. In the absence of natural predation, the population is expanding rapidly, favoring traits associated with faster reproduction, such as smaller size at maturity.", "solution": "We are asked to explain, in evolutionary terms, why a fish population exposed to decade-long, size-selective, intensive fishing shifted from maturing at about 5 years and 60 cm to maturing at about 3 years and 45 cm. The fishery uses gillnets with mesh that efficiently captures fish larger than 55 cm, thereby imposing high mortality on larger and older individuals.\n\nKey evolutionary principle: when mortality increases disproportionately for a subset of phenotypes, alleles that reduce exposure to that mortality by changing the life-history schedule can increase in frequency. In size-selective harvests, this is a directional selection against late-maturing, large-bodied genotypes and in favor of genotypes that mature earlier and at smaller size.\n\nA concise life-history formulation clarifies the selection direction. Let $t_{m}$ denote age at maturity, $L_{m}$ denote length at maturity, $M$ denote natural mortality, and $F(L)$ denote fishing mortality as a function of body length. Gillnet selectivity implies a selectivity function $s(L)$ with $s(L)\\approx 0$ for $L<55$ cm and $s(L)$ large for $L\\geq 55$ cm, so that $F(L)=s(L)F_{0}$ with $F_{0}>0$ set by fishing intensity. If growth is monotonic, then $L(t)$ increases with $t$, so delaying maturity increases exposure to $F(L)$ once $L(t)$ crosses the selectivity threshold.\n\nIf $S(t_{m})$ is survival to first reproduction and $f(L_{m})$ is fecundity at maturity, a simple proxy for expected lifetime reproductive output is\n$$\nR(t_{m})=\\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t_{m}}\\left[M+F(L(t))\\right]\\,dt\\right)\\,f(L_{m}).\n$$\nBecause $f(L_{m})$ typically increases with size while $F(L(t))$ increases sharply once $L(t)$ exceeds the net’s effective mesh size, increasing $t_{m}$ yields two opposing effects: higher fecundity via larger $L_{m}$ but lower survival to maturity via higher cumulative mortality. Under intense, size-selective fishing, the term involving $F(L(t))$ dominates once $L(t)$ approaches the selectivity threshold, making $\\frac{dR}{dt_{m}}<0$ at the ancestral $t_{m}$. Thus, genotypes with smaller $t_{m}$ and accordingly smaller $L_{m}$ enjoy higher $R$ because they reproduce before entering the high-mortality size classes. This produces a directional evolutionary response toward earlier maturation at smaller size over multiple generations, consistent with fisheries-induced evolution observed empirically.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- A is incorrect. Gillnets do not impose geographic isolation among sub-populations; claiming drift as the primary cause of a consistent, directional shift that aligns exactly with the selectivity regime is implausible. Drift is random and would not predictably target earlier maturation and smaller size across the population.\n- B is incorrect. Stress-induced developmental changes would be phenotypic and non-heritable; the statement invokes inheritance of acquired characteristics, which contradicts standard genetics.\n- C is incomplete and largely incorrect. Reduced competition may alter growth rates phenotypically, but the observed pattern is a population-level shift to smaller size at maturity and earlier age, persisting over several generations under continued selective removal of large fish. That pattern is best explained by heritable evolutionary change under selection rather than purely plastic, non-heritable responses. Moreover, improved conditions typically would not favor smaller size at maturity absent strong opposing mortality selection.\n- D is correct. Intense, size-selective fishing imposes high mortality on large, older fish, creating strong directional selection for earlier maturation at smaller size, because such individuals are more likely to reproduce before being caught. Over multiple generations, alleles for early maturation increase in frequency, matching the observed shift.\n- E is not supported. Even if some predators are bycaught, the dominant mortality in this system is from fishing targeting large fish. Predator release would not specifically predict smaller size at maturity; in many cases reduced predation on juveniles can permit delayed maturation and larger size, contrary to the observation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete evolutionary explanation is the directional selection imposed by size-selective fishing, which is option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2300088"}]}
