Two identical litterbags, A and B, are prepared, each containing an initial dry mass of 50.0 grams of freshly fallen maple leaves. Litterbag A is constructed from a fine mesh with 1.0 mm openings, while litterbag B is constructed from a coarse mesh with 5.0 mm openings. Both bags are placed on the soil surface at the same location. After exactly one year, the bags are retrieved, and the remaining contents are dried and weighed. The final mass of the litter in bag A is 35.0 grams, and the final mass in bag B is 22.5 grams.\n\nThe percentage of mass lost is defined as $\\frac{M_{\\text{initial}} - M_{\\text{final}}}{M_{\\text{initial}}} \\times 100$. Based on the data, calculate the difference in the percentage of mass lost between the two bags (percentage mass loss in B minus percentage mass loss in A), and identify the primary factor responsible for this difference.

This is the standard interpretation of litterbag mesh-size experiments. Therefore, the correct option stating both the numerical difference and the reason is the one indicating 25 percentage points due to macroinvertebrate access.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1838110"}, {"introduction": "Behind the observable mass loss in a litterbag lies a microscopic world of microbial metabolism governed by strict biochemical rules. The relative abundance of carbon and nitrogen in organic matter, often expressed as the C:N ratio, is a key factor controlling decomposition speed and nutrient availability [@problem_id:1838117].

The single exponential decay model is a fundamental tool for this purpose, but its true power lies in connecting the abstract decay constant, $k$, to tangible properties of the litter and its environment [@problem_id:1838090]. This advanced exercise asks you to model the simultaneous decomposition of two different litter types, linking their distinct decay rates to their chemical quality and predicting how the composition of the remaining organic matter changes over time.", "problem": "In terrestrial ecosystems, the decomposition of leaf litter is a critical process for nutrient cycling. A widely used model to describe the mass of decomposing organic matter is the single exponential decay model, $M(t) = M_0 \\exp(-kt)$, where $M(t)$ is the mass at time $t$, $M_0$ is the initial mass, and $k$ is the decomposition rate constant. The value of $k$ is strongly influenced by the chemical composition of the litter.\n\nAn ecologist is studying decomposition in a temperate forest using litterbags. Two dominant tree species in this forest are Aspen and Oak. It is known that the decomposition rate constant, $k$, for a given leaf type is inversely proportional to its initial Lignin-to-Nitrogen (L:N) ratio.\n\nThe ecologist creates a set of identical litterbags, each containing an equal initial dry mass of Aspen leaves and Oak leaves. Through chemical analysis, it is determined that the initial L:N ratio of Oak leaves is exactly twice the initial L:N ratio of Aspen leaves.\n\nCalculate the fraction of the total remaining mass in a litterbag that is composed of Oak leaves at the precise moment when the total mass of all litter in the bag has decreased to 50% of its initial total mass.
