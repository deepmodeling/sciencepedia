The proportion in the diet is $P_1 = 15\\% = 0.15$.\n2.  **Zooplankton**: These are primary consumers that feed on phytoplankton ($TL=1$). Therefore, their trophic level is $TL_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$. The proportion in the diet is $P_2 = 45\\% = 0.45$.\n3.  **Smelt**: These are secondary consumers that feed on zooplankton ($TL=2$). Therefore, their trophic level is $TL_3 = 1 + 2 = 3$.
