This material is known as Coarse Particulate Organic Matter (CPOM). The breakdown of CPOM is a critical process, and it occurs through two main pathways. The first is a baseline process of leaching and microbial decomposition, which occurs at a rate directly proportional to the mass of CPOM present. The second pathway involves consumption by a group of aquatic invertebrates known as \"shredders\" (e.g., certain species of caddisfly and stonefly larvae), which break down the large leaf fragments. The rate of CPOM consumption by shredders is also directly proportional to the mass of CPOM present.\n\nAn ecologist sets up an experiment in two identical, isolated stream channels, A and B. Channel A represents a natural, healthy stream with a stable population of shredders. Channel B is an experimental channel from which all shredder invertebrates have been carefully removed.\n\nAt the start of the experiment (time $t=0$), a single pulse of leaves, representing an initial mass $M_0$ of CPOM, is added to each channel. The breakdown process is then monitored. The parameters for the system are defined as follows:\n- Initial mass of CPOM: $M_0 = 500.0$ grams\n- Microbial decomposition rate constant: $k_m = 0.0080 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}$\n- Shredder processing rate constant: $k_s = 0.025 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}$\n- Duration of the experiment: $T = 60$ days\n\nAssuming the rate constants remain constant throughout the experiment, calculate the additional mass of CPOM that has accumulated in the experimental channel (Channel B) compared to the control channel (Channel A) after the full duration of the experiment.

This final practice moves from ecosystem processes to the molecular and evolutionary scale to answer this pressing environmental question. You will explore the biochemical reasons why the same microbial communities that efficiently recycle cellulose fail to degrade polyethylene, highlighting the profound role of evolutionary history in shaping present-day ecological functions [@problem_id:1878851].", "problem": "A team of environmental biologists is investigating the biodegradability of different polymers in a controlled soil mesocosm. The mesocosm contains a rich and diverse community of decomposers (bacteria and fungi) isolated from a pristine old-growth forest. Two polymers are introduced into separate, identical mesocosms:\n\n1.  **Cellulose:** A natural polysaccharide composed of D-glucose units linked by beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds. Its chemical formula can be represented as $(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{10}\\text{O}_5)_n$.\n2.  **Polyethylene:** A common synthetic polymer created by the polymerization of ethene. Its structure consists of a long chain of repeating $-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-$ units.\n\nAfter one year, analysis reveals that over 95% of the cellulose has been decomposed, while the polyethylene sample shows no measurable signs of degradation. Which of the following statements provides the most fundamental biochemical and evolutionary explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The carbon-carbon single bonds that form the backbone of polyethylene are intrinsically unbreakable by any known biological enzyme, whereas the glycosidic bonds in cellulose are much weaker and easily cleaved.\n\nB. Synthetic polymers like polyethylene are acutely toxic to the vast majority of soil microorganisms, inhibiting all metabolic activity in their immediate vicinity.\n\nC. The degradation of polyethylene is an energy-intensive process that yields very little net energy for the microorganisms, so they preferentially consume the more energy-rich cellulose, ignoring the plastic.\n\nD. The decomposer community lacks enzymes with active sites that are sterically and chemically compatible with the non-polar, uniform hydrocarbon structure of polyethylene, as there has been no historical evolutionary pressure to metabolize such a molecule.\n\nE. The breakdown of large polymers like polyethylene can only be initiated by physical processes such as ultraviolet radiation, which is absent in the soil, whereas cellulose degradation is purely enzymatic.", "solution": "We are asked to choose the most fundamental biochemical and evolutionary explanation for why a diverse soil decomposer community rapidly degrades cellulose, represented as $(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{10}\\text{O}_5)_n$ with $\\beta$-1,4 glycosidic linkages, but shows no measurable degradation of polyethylene, a high-molecular-mass hydrocarbon chain of repeating $-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-$ units, after one year.\n\nFirst, identify the biochemical basis for cellulose biodegradability. Cellulose is a natural polysaccharide produced by plants and many other organisms. Soil decomposers (bacteria and fungi) have evolved sophisticated enzyme systems (e.g., endoglucanases, exoglucanases/cellobiohydrolases, and $\\beta$-glucosidases) that specifically bind to and hydrolyze $\\beta$-1,4 glycosidic bonds. These enzymes possess active sites and accessory domains (e.g., carbohydrate-binding modules) that recognize the stereochemistry, hydrogen-bonding patterns, and repeating polar functional groups in cellulose. The hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds is chemically feasible and proceeds enzymatically via acid-base catalysis or neighboring group participation in the enzyme active site; critically, the determining factor is the evolved specificity of enzyme active sites for the substrate’s chemical features, not the absolute “strength” of the bond in isolation.\n\nSecond, analyze why polyethylene resists biodegradation. Polyethylene presents a non-polar, chemically uniform, highly hydrophobic backbone consisting of $C-C$ and $C-H$ bonds without heteroatoms or hydrolyzable linkages. This structure lacks functional groups that provide handles for common hydrolases or oxidoreductases to bind and catalyze initial scission. In addition, its crystallinity and hydrophobicity reduce accessibility. Most importantly, because polyethylene is anthropogenic and evolutionarily recent relative to geological timescales of microbial evolution, there has been minimal historical selection pressure for microorganisms to evolve enzymes with active sites that complement and catalyze depolymerization of a uniform saturated hydrocarbon chain in solid form. While enzymes exist that oxidize small alkanes (e.g., monooxygenases), they act on soluble substrates and do not generally depolymerize solid, high-crystallinity polyethylene without prior abiotic or enzymatic activation (e.g., oxidation introducing carbonyls). Thus, the fundamental reason is the lack of evolved, compatible enzymatic machinery due to absent evolutionary exposure and selection, rather than an absolute chemical impossibility.\n\nNow evaluate each option:\n\nA. Claiming $C-C$ single bonds are intrinsically unbreakable by enzymes is false. Enzymes can cleave $C-C$ bonds and oxidize hydrocarbons under appropriate conditions. The difference is not bond “unbreakability” versus “weakness” but substrate-enzyme compatibility and evolved catalytic strategies.\n\nB. Polyethylene is generally inert and not acutely toxic to soil microbes. Observed lack of degradation is not due to broad toxicity suppressing metabolism but due to lack of suitable enzymatic attack and poor accessibility.\n\nC. The argument that polyethylene yields little net energy is incorrect. Complete oxidation of hydrocarbons yields substantial energy. The problem is activation and depolymerization, not low energetic payoff. Microbes cannot “preferentially choose” polyethylene if they lack the enzymes to initiate its breakdown.\n\nD. This correctly states that the decomposer community lacks enzymes whose active sites are sterically and chemically compatible with the non-polar, uniform hydrocarbon structure of polyethylene, and that there has been no historical evolutionary pressure to metabolize such a molecule. This is the fundamental biochemical and evolutionary explanation.\n\nE. It is incorrect to state that polyethylene breakdown can only be initiated by ultraviolet radiation. Other pathways (e.g., thermo-oxidation, photo-oxidation, radical chemistry, or certain oxidative enzymes) can introduce functional groups, albeit slowly. Moreover, cellulose degradation is not “purely” enzymatic in all environments, but the key distinction is enzyme availability and compatibility, not the presence or absence of ultraviolet radiation in soil.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental explanation is the absence of evolved, compatible enzymes due to lack of evolutionary pressure to degrade a non-polar synthetic polymer with uniform structure, as stated in option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1878851"}]}
