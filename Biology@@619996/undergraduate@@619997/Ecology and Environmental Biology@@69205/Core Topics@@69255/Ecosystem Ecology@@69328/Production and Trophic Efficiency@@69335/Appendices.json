This exercise introduces a classic experimental technique in aquatic ecology for quantifying the rate at which producers like phytoplankton convert light energy into chemical energy. By simulating conditions with and without light, you will learn to parse the raw data to distinguish between the total energy captured (Gross Primary Production, or $GPP$) and the energy that remains after accounting for metabolic costs (Net Primary Production, or $NPP$) [@problem_id:1876282]. This practice is fundamental for assessing the health and base-level energy availability of aquatic environments.", "problem": "A team of limnologists is investigating the primary productivity of a lake that has been experiencing algal blooms. They use the light and dark bottle method to quantify the metabolic rates of the phytoplankton community at a depth of 2 meters. Water samples are collected from this depth and their initial Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentration is measured to be 8.54 mg/L. The samples are then sealed in two types of bottles: transparent \"light\" bottles and opaque \"dark\" bottles. These bottles are incubated by suspending them at the 2-meter depth for an experimental period of 5.0 hours. After incubation, the final DO concentrations are measured. The average final DO concentration in the light bottles is 10.12 mg/L, and in the dark bottles, it is 7.89 mg/L.\n\nYour task is to calculate the Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) of the phytoplankton community.
