This first practice lays the groundwork by exploring the fundamental energy budget of a consumer. By working through this hypothetical scenario with a sea urchin, you will learn to apply the core equation of secondary production, which accounts for energy intake (ingestion), undigested waste (egestion), and metabolic costs (respiration) to determine the net energy allocated to growth and reproduction [@problem_id:1879369].", "problem": "A marine ecologist is studying the energy budget of the purple sea urchin, *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*, in a kelp forest ecosystem. Over a one-week observation period, an individual urchin is found to have consumed a mass $M_I$ of kelp. During the same period, it egests a mass $M_E$ of fecal pellets. The ecologist determines that the average energy density of the kelp is $C_I$, while the average energy density of the dry fecal matter is $C_E$, as it contains undigested organic material. Furthermore, the total energy expended by the urchin for cellular respiration during this week is measured to be $R$.\n\nGiven the following data:\n- Mass of kelp consumed, $M_I = 125.0$ g\n- Mass of fecal pellets egested, $M_E = 85.0$ g\n- Energy density of kelp, $C_I = 2.50$ kJ/g\n- Energy density of fecal pellets, $C_E = 0.850$ kJ/g\n- Energy lost to respiration, $R = 155.0$ kJ\n\nCalculate the net secondary production (the energy allocated to growth and reproduction) of the sea urchin over this one-week period.

In a controlled laboratory setting, a cohort of caterpillars is found to consume a total of 2000 Joules of leaf biomass over their larval stage. Through careful measurement of their frass (fecal waste), the energy content of the egested, unutilized material is determined to be 1100 Joules. The energy expended by the caterpillars for metabolic activities, such as movement and maintaining body temperature (respiration), is measured to be 630 Joules.

Production efficiency is 70.0%; egested energy is lost as thermal energy during the process of digestion.", "solution": "The problem requires us to calculate the production efficiency of the caterpillar cohort and correctly identify the nature of egested energy. We are given the following values:\n- Ingestion (I) = 2000 J\n- Egestion (F, for feces/frass) = 1100 J\n- Respiration (R) = 630 J\n\nFirst, we must determine the amount of energy that is assimilated (A) by the caterpillars. Assimilated energy is the portion of ingested energy that an organism absorbs across its gut wall. It is calculated by subtracting the egested energy from the total ingested energy.\n$$A = I - F$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$A = 2000 \\, \\text{J} - 1100 \\, \\text{J} = 900 \\, \\text{J}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the energy allocated to secondary production (P), which is the energy used for growth and reproduction. The assimilated energy (A) is partitioned into two main components: energy lost through respiration (R) and energy used for production (P). The relationship is:\n$$A = P + R$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for P:\n$$P = A - R$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for A and the given value for R:\n$$P = 900 \\, \\text{J} - 630 \\, \\text{J} = 270 \\, \\text{J}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the production efficiency. The problem statement defines production efficiency (PE) as the percentage of assimilated energy that is converted into new biomass. The formula is:\n$$\\text{PE} = \\frac{P}{A}$$\nUsing our calculated values for P and A:\n$$\\text{PE} = \\frac{270 \\, \\text{J}}{900 \\, \\text{J}} = 0.3$$\nTo express this as a percentage as given in the options, we multiply by 100:\n$$\\text{PE} = 0.3 \\times 100\\% = 30.0\\%$$\nThis calculation eliminates options B, C, and E.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate the conceptual part of the question regarding the fate of the egested energy (1100 J). Egested energy represents the chemical energy contained in ingested materials that the organism cannot digest and absorb. For an herbivore like a caterpillar eating leaves, this largely consists of complex structural carbohydrates like cellulose, for which it lacks the necessary digestive enzymes. This material passes through the digestive tract and is expelled as waste (frass) without ever crossing the gut wall to enter the body's metabolic pathways.\n\nLet's examine the explanations in the remaining options:\n- Option A states: \"egested energy consists of molecules that were absorbed but were too complex to be used in metabolism.\" This is incorrect. Egested energy, by definition, is *not* absorbed.\n- Option D states: \"egested energy consists of indigestible materials, such as cellulose, that were never absorbed across the gut wall.\" This is the correct description of egested energy.\n\nTherefore, the only option that has both the correct production efficiency (30.0%) and the correct explanation for egested energy is Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1879418"}, {"introduction": "The principles of secondary production scale up from a single organism or population to govern the flow of energy through entire ecosystems.
