The predator alternates between two exclusive activities: searching and handling. Let $a$ denote the predatorâ€™s effective encounter rate per unit search time and per unit area (square meters per second), and let $h$ denote the handling time per prey item (seconds per prey). Assume the following well-tested facts and definitions:\n- During searching, prey encounters occur as a Poisson process whose mean rate is proportional to prey density, so that the expected encounter rate while searching is $aN$ (prey per second of search time).\n- While handling a prey item, the predator cannot search for another prey for a duration $h$ (seconds per prey).\n- Over a long time horizon, define the realized feeding rate as $f(N)$ (prey per second), equal to the long-run average number of prey consumed per unit time.\n- The fraction of time spent searching equals $1 - h f(N)$, because the expected time spent handling per unit time is $h$ times the consumption rate.\n\nStarting from these facts and definitions only (do not assume any particular functional form for $f(N)$), derive an explicit expression for $f(N)$ in terms of $N$, $a$, and $h$.

The realized feeding rate, $f(N)$, is the number of prey consumed per unit of total time. This rate must be equal to the number of prey encountered per unit of total time.\n\nThe number of prey encountered per unit of *search time* is given as $aN$.\nLet $T_{search}$ be the time spent searching and $T_{total}$ be the total time over a long horizon. The fraction of total time spent searching is given as $1 - hf(N)$. Therefore, we can write the relationship:\n$$ \\frac{T_{search}}{T_{total}} = 1 - hf(N) $$\nThe total number of prey consumed, $C$, during the total time $T_{total}$ is by definition $C = f(N) T_{total}$.\nThis same number of consumed prey must equal the number of prey encountered during the search time, $T_{search}$. The encounter rate during searching is $aN$. So, the total number of encounters is:\n$$ C = (aN) \\times T_{search} $$\nWe now have two expressions for the total number of prey consumed, $C$. Equating them gives:\n$$ f(N) T_{total} = aN \\times T_{search} $$\nWe can divide both sides by $T_{total}$ to find the relationship between the rates:\n$$ f(N) = aN \\times \\frac{T_{search}}{T_{total}} $$\nSubstituting the given expression for the fraction of search time, $\\frac{T_{search}}{T_{total}} = 1 - hf(N)$, into this equation gives:\n$$ f(N) = aN (1 - hf(N)) $$\nThis is an equation for $f(N)$ which we must now solve. The equation is algebraic in $f(N)$.\n$$ f(N) = aN - aNhf(N) $$\nCollect all terms containing $f(N)$ on one side of the equation:\n$$ f(N) + aNhf(N) = aN $$\nFactor out $f(N)$:\n$$ f(N)(1 + aNh) = aN $$\nIsolating $f(N)$ yields the explicit expression for the functional response:\n$$ f(N) = \\frac{aN}{1 + aNh} $$\nThis is the Holling Type II functional response.\n\nNext, we must find the saturation feeding rate, which is defined as the limit of $f(N)$ as the prey density $N$ approaches infinity. Let this be $f_{sat}$.\n$$ f_{sat} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} f(N) = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{aN}{1 + aNh} $$\nTo evaluate this limit, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of $N$, which is $N^1$:\n$$ f_{sat} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{aN}{N}}{\\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{aNh}{N}} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{a}{\\frac{1}{N} + ah} $$\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{1}{N}$ approaches $0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ f_{sat} = \\frac{a}{0 + ah} = \\frac{a}{ah} = \\frac{1}{h} $$\nThe saturation feeding rate is therefore $\\frac{1}{h}$. This result is intuitive: at infinite prey density, the predator is never searching, only handling prey. The time to consume one prey is $h$, so the rate of consumption is $\\frac{1}{h}$.\n\nFinally, we must find the prey density $N_{1/2}$ at which the feeding rate $f(N)$ is exactly one-half of its saturation value, $f_{sat}$.\nWe set up the equation:\n$$ f(N_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} f_{sat} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f(N)$ and $f_{sat}$:\n$$ \\frac{aN_{1/2}}{1 + aN_{1/2}h} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{h}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2h} $$\nWe now solve for $N_{1/2}$.
