This introductory exercise guides you through the logic of a fundamental tool in chemical ecology: the bioassay. You will use hypothetical data from a classic setup to calculate an Index of Germination Inhibition, providing a quantitative measure for the allelopathic effect of an invasive plant. This practice is a crucial first step in turning a qualitative ecological observation into testable, hard data.

A bioassay is designed using radish seeds (*Raphanus sativus*) to test the hypothesis that compounds leached from garlic mustard inhibit seed germination.\n\nThe experiment consists of two groups: a control group and a treatment group. For the treatment group, an aqueous extract is prepared by soaking a known mass of garlic mustard roots in a fixed volume of distilled water. For the control group, only distilled water is used.\n\nThe ecologist sets up 10 identical petri dishes, each lined with filter paper and containing 25 radish seeds. Five of these dishes are assigned to the control group and are moistened with 5 mL of distilled water. The other five dishes are assigned to the treatment group and are moistened with 5 mL of the garlic mustard extract. All dishes are then sealed and kept under identical temperature and light conditions for one week.\n\nAfter one week, the number of germinated seeds in each group is counted. The data are as follows:\n- In the five control dishes, a total of 115 seeds germinated.\n- In the five treatment dishes, a total of 42 seeds germinated.\n\nTo quantify the magnitude of the allelopathic effect, we define a dimensionless measure called the Index of Germination Inhibition (IGI). The IGI is calculated using the formula:\n$$ IGI = \\frac{C - T}{C} $$\nwhere $C$ is the total number of germinated seeds in the control group and $T$ is the total number of germinated seeds in the treatment group.\n\nCalculate the value of the Index of Germination Inhibition for this experiment.

A key aspect of plant defense is \"induced indirect defense,\" where the plant, upon being attacked, releases chemical signals that attract predators of the attacking herbivore. The primary predator of *T. urticae* is the predatory mite, *Phytoseiulus persimilis*. The researchers conducted two experiments to identify potential chemical mediators of this defense.\n\n**Experiment 1: Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Analysis**\nTwo groups of tomato plants were used: a 'Control' group kept free of mites, and an 'Infested' group exposed to a controlled population of *T. urticae* for one week. The airborne VOCs released from each group were collected and analyzed. The mean emission rates for four candidate compounds are listed below, along with the p-value from a statistical test comparing the 'Control' and 'Infested' groups.

The answer lies in economics: defense is metabolically expensive. This final practice introduces you to the power of ecological modeling, where we use mathematical principles to understand evolutionary trade-offs. You will develop a cost-benefit model to determine the optimal concentration, $x_{opt}$, of a defensive compound, learning how theoretical frameworks can predict a plant's chemical strategy based on costs like metabolic energy and benefits like reduced herbivory. [@problem_id:1834736]", "problem": "An ecologist is developing a model to understand the chemical defense strategy of a particular plant species against a specialist insect herbivore. The plant produces a phenolic defensive compound at a concentration $x$ (in milligrams per gram of leaf tissue).\n\nThe production of this compound incurs a metabolic cost to the plant. This cost, measured in units of reduced photosynthetic potential, is accurately described by the function $C(x) = \\alpha x^2$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive constant representing the metabolic cost coefficient.\n\nThe benefit of producing the compound is the protection of leaf tissue from herbivory, thereby preserving photosynthetic potential. This benefit, $B(x, H)$, depends on both the compound concentration $x$ and the local herbivore density $H$ (measured as insects per plant). The benefit function is given by $B(x, H) = \\beta H \\frac{x}{K+x}$, where $\\beta$ is a positive constant that scales the impact of herbivory, and $K$ is the compound concentration at which the defensive effect is half-maximal.\n\nBased on field observations, the ecologist hypothesizes that the plant's evolved strategy operates in a regime where the compound is costly to produce, such that the optimal concentration, $x_{opt}$, is significantly lower than the saturation constant $K$ (i.e., $x_{opt} \\ll K$).\n\nAssuming the plant optimizes its fitness by maximizing the net photosynthetic gain, defined as $G(x) = B(x, H) - C(x)$, derive an analytical expression for the optimal concentration of the defensive compound, $x_{opt}$. Your expression should be in terms of the parameters $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $H$, and $K$.", "solution": "We seek the concentration $x$ that maximizes the net photosynthetic gain $G(x) = B(x,H) - C(x)$, where $B(x,H) = \\beta H \\frac{x}{K+x}$ and $C(x) = \\alpha x^{2}$. Thus,\n$$\nG(x) = \\beta H \\frac{x}{K+x} - \\alpha x^{2}.\n$$\nTo find an interior optimum, differentiate $G(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set the derivative to zero. Using the quotient rule,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{x}{K+x}\\right) = \\frac{(K+x)\\cdot 1 - x \\cdot 1}{(K+x)^{2}} = \\frac{K}{(K+x)^{2}}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nG'(x) = \\beta H \\frac{K}{(K+x)^{2}} - 2 \\alpha x.\n$$\nThe first-order condition for an interior optimum is\n$$\n\\beta H \\frac{K}{(K+x)^{2}} - 2 \\alpha x = 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 2 \\alpha x (K+x)^{2} = \\beta H K.\n$$\nThis equation is cubic in $x$. However, the problem states the biologically relevant regime $x_{\\text{opt}} \\ll K$.
