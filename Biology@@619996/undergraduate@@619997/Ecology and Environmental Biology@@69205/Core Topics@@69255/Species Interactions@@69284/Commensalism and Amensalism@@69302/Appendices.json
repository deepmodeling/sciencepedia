This first practice challenges you to dissect a scene from a forest floor and classify the relationships between different organisms based on their described outcomes. Mastering this skill is the first step toward understanding community structure, as it requires you to apply the precise definitions of amensalism $(0/-)$, commensalism $(+/0)$, and exploitation $(+/-)$ to real-world scenarios [@problem_id:1835861].", "problem": "In a temperate forest ecosystem, several species interactions are observed on and around a fallen log. Consider the following three distinct interactions, labeled A, B, and C:\n\n**Interaction A**: A large, mature oak tree casts a dense shadow over the forest floor. At the base of the oak, a small, light-demanding wildflower species attempts to grow. Due to the low light conditions created by the oak's canopy, the wildflower's growth is severely stunted and it fails to produce seeds. The large oak tree is entirely unaffected by the presence of the tiny wildflower beneath it.\n\n**Interaction B**: A species of shelf fungus is growing on a fallen, dead log. The metabolic activity of the fungus breaks down the tough woody material, creating softened pockets and galleries within the log. These modified areas provide a crucial protected habitat for the larvae of a jewel beetle species. Without the fungus's preparatory action, the log would be too hard for the larvae to inhabit. The fungus, in turn, is not measurably harmed or benefited by the beetle larvae living within the wood it is decomposing.\n\n**Interaction C**: After completing their larval stage, the jewel beetles emerge as winged adults. These adult beetles fly to the canopy of the living oak tree described in Interaction A and feed on its leaves for sustenance. This consumption of leaf tissue represents a loss of photosynthetic capacity and biomass for the oak tree.\n\nBased on these descriptions, which of the following options correctly classifies the ecological relationship for Interaction A, Interaction B, and Interaction C, respectively?\n\nA. Interaction A: Amensalism, Interaction B: Commensalism, Interaction C: Exploitation\n\nB. Interaction A: Competition, Interaction B: Mutualism, Interaction C: Parasitism\n\nC. Interaction A: Amensalism, Interaction B: Mutualism, Interaction C: Competition\n\nD. Interaction A: Competition, Interaction B: Commensalism, Interaction C: Exploitation\n\nE. Interaction A: Neutralism, Interaction B: Amensalism, Interaction C: Commensalism", "solution": "We first recall the canonical ecological interaction categories:\n- Amensalism: one species is harmed while the other is unaffected, denoted as negative/zero.\n- Commensalism: one species benefits while the other is unaffected, denoted as positive/zero.\n- Exploitation: one species benefits while the other is harmed, denoted as positive/negative; this includes herbivory, predation, and parasitism.\n- Competition: both species are harmed through shared resource limitation, negative/negative.\n- Mutualism: both species benefit, positive/positive.\n- Neutralism: neither species is affected, zero/zero.\n\nAnalyze each interaction:\n\nInteraction A: The oak casts shade that severely stunts the light-demanding wildflower, preventing seed production. The oak is unaffected by the wildflower’s presence. This is negative for the wildflower and neutral for the oak, which matches amensalism.\n\nInteraction B: The fungus decomposes the dead log, creating softened galleries that enable jewel beetle larvae to inhabit the wood; the fungus is not measurably affected by the larvae’s presence. This is positive for the beetle larvae and neutral for the fungus, which matches commensalism.\n\nInteraction C: Adult beetles feed on leaves of the living oak, reducing its photosynthetic capacity and biomass, while the beetles gain resources. This is positive for the beetles and negative for the oak, which is exploitation (specifically herbivory).\n\nComparing to the options, the sequence Amensalism, Commensalism, Exploitation corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1835861"}, {"introduction": "Ecological relationships are not always direct; often, the effect one species has on another is mediated by a third party. This exercise explores the concept of an indirect interaction, where a fungus, by harming a tree species, inadvertently harms a bird species that relies on that tree. By analyzing this three-species system, you will practice identifying both direct interactions, like parasitism and commensalism, and more subtle indirect ones, such as the resulting amensalism between the fungus and the bird [@problem_id:1835853].", "problem": "In a North American forest ecosystem, a particular species of migratory songbird, the boreal warbler, constructs its nests almost exclusively in the cavities of mature heartwood pine trees. The presence of the warblers and their nests does not measurably impact the health or reproductive success of the pine trees. This forest is experiencing an outbreak of a non-native fungal pathogen, *Forestina destructans*, which is highly specific to the heartwood pine. The fungus infects the trees, leading to a significant decline in the pine population over several years. The boreal warbler is not a host for the fungus, and its activities do not influence the spread or life cycle of the pathogen.\n\nBased on this scenario, which of the following statements correctly identifies the primary ecological interactions between these three species?\n\nA.

Fungus-Pine: Competition; Pine-Warbler: Parasitism; Fungus-Warbler: Commensalism", "solution": "We first recall the standard ecological interaction categories using sign notation for effects on the two species: parasitism is $(+, -)$ where one benefits and the other is harmed; commensalism is $(+, 0)$ where one benefits and the other is unaffected; mutualism is $(+, +)$ where both benefit; competition is $(-, -)$ where both are negatively affected due to shared limitation; amensalism is $(-, 0)$ where one is harmed and the other is unaffected.\n\nBetween the fungus and the pine: the pathogen infects and causes a decline in the pine population, so the fungus gains resources and reproduction from infecting the host while the pine is harmed. This fits parasitism, i.e., $(+, -)$.\n\nBetween the pine and the warbler: the warbler uses pine cavities for nesting, benefiting from the tree as habitat, while the problem states the warbler’s presence does not measurably impact pine health or reproduction; thus the tree is unaffected. This fits commensalism, i.e., $(+, 0)$ from the warbler’s perspective and $(0, +)$ from the pine’s perspective, jointly commensalism.\n\nBetween the fungus and the warbler: the warbler is not a host and does not influence the pathogen’s spread or life cycle, so there is no direct effect of warbler on fungus. However, the fungus reduces the pine population, which removes nesting sites that the warbler relies on almost exclusively, thereby negatively affecting the warbler. The fungus remains unaffected by the warbler. This is amensalism, i.e., $(-, 0)$ with the warbler harmed and the fungus unaffected.\n\nMatching these to the options, the combination is: Fungus-Pine: Parasitism; Pine-Warbler: Commensalism; Fungus-Warbler: Amensalism, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1835853"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative classification to quantitative prediction is a key step in ecological science. This problem asks you to model a commensal relationship between a liana and a tree using a system of differential equations, a powerful tool for understanding population dynamics. You will see how the one-way benefit in a commensal pairing can be mathematically represented by making one species' carrying capacity, $K_L$, a function of the other's population size, $N_T$, allowing you to solve for the stable equilibrium state of the community [@problem_id:1835851].", "problem": "An ecologist is modeling the commensal relationship between a canopy tree (species T) and a non-parasitic liana (species L) in a recovering forest ecosystem. The population dynamics of these two species are described by a coupled system of logistic growth equations.\n\nThe tree population, denoted by $N_T$, is unaffected by the presence of the liana. Its population dynamics follow a standard logistic growth model, with an intrinsic rate of increase $r_T$ and a carrying capacity $K_T$.\n\nThe liana population, denoted by $N_L$, benefits from the structural support provided by the trees, which increases its access to sunlight and other resources. Consequently, its growth is also logistic, with an intrinsic rate of increase $r_L$, but its carrying capacity, $K_L$, is not a fixed value. Instead, it is a linear function of the tree population size:\n$$K_L(N_T) = K_{L0} + \\beta N_T$$\nHere, $K_{L0}$ represents the liana's baseline carrying capacity on the forest floor in the complete absence of trees, and $\\beta$ is a positive constant known as the \"commensal support coefficient,\" which quantifies the additional carrying capacity for the liana population provided by a single tree. All parameters ($r_T, K_T, r_L, K_{L0}, \\beta$) are positive real constants.\n\nAssuming the ecosystem evolves over a long period and reaches a stable coexistence equilibrium where both species maintain positive population sizes, determine the equilibrium population size of the liana, $N_L^*$.
