This exercise challenges you to step into the role of a marine biologist to design an experiment that can effectively distinguish between two competing defensive functions of a single behavior in decorator crabs. By evaluating different experimental setups, you will develop a deeper appreciation for the critical role of controls in isolating variables and drawing valid scientific conclusions [@problem_id:1830747].", "problem": "A marine biologist is studying the defensive strategies of the decorator crab, *Camposcia retusa*. This species is known to meticulously attach materials from its environment, particularly sponges, to its carapace and legs. The biologist observes that the crab preferentially uses the sponge *Spongia toxica*, which is known to contain chemical compounds that are noxious to local predatory fish. This observation leads to two competing hypotheses for the function of this decorating behavior:\n\n1.  **Crypsis Hypothesis**: The sponge decoration serves primarily as camouflage, visually blending the crab into its surroundings and making it harder for predators to detect.\n2.  **Chemical Defense Hypothesis**: The sponge decoration serves primarily as a chemical deterrent, where the noxious compounds in the sponge repel predators upon contact or attempted consumption.\n\nThe biologist has access to a controlled field site with a natural population of the primary predator, a species of predatory wrasse. In addition to *S. toxica*, a second sponge species, *Spongia innocua*, is available. *S. innocua* is non-toxic but shares a similar color, size, and texture to *S. toxica*. The biologist plans to place individual crabs into separate mesh enclosures on the seafloor, which allow predators to see and attack the crabs but prevent the crabs from escaping.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs would most effectively and rigorously distinguish between the crypsis and chemical defense hypotheses?\n\nA. Compare the predation rates between two groups of crabs: (1) crabs with their shells scrubbed clean (undecorated) and (2) crabs decorated with the toxic sponge, *S. toxica*.\n\nB. Compare the predation rates between two groups of crabs: (1) crabs decorated with the toxic sponge, *S. toxica*, and (2) crabs decorated with small, brightly colored, non-toxic plastic beads.\n\nC. Compare the predation rates among three groups of crabs: (1) crabs with their shells scrubbed clean (undecorated), (2) crabs decorated with the non-toxic sponge, *S. innocua*, and (3) crabs decorated with the toxic sponge, *S. toxica*.\n\nD. Place all three types of crabs described in option C (undecorated, decorated with *S. innocua*, and decorated with *S. toxica*) together into a single large enclosure with several predators, and record the order in which the crabs are consumed.\n\nE. In a laboratory aquarium without predators, present crabs with an equal choice of the toxic sponge (*S. toxica*) and the non-toxic sponge (*S. innocua*), and measure which material they preferentially use for decoration.", "solution": "Define the testable predictions of the two hypotheses in terms of predator attack or consumption probability (predation rate). Let $p_{U}$ denote the predation rate on undecorated crabs, $p_{I}$ on crabs decorated with the non-toxic but visually similar sponge S. innocua, and $p_{T}$ on crabs decorated with the toxic sponge S. toxica.\n\nUnder the Crypsis Hypothesis (visual camouflage is primary), the visual match provided by both sponges should reduce detection similarly, regardless of chemical properties. Therefore the prediction is:\n$$\np_{U} > p_{I} \\approx p_{T}.\n$$\n\nUnder the Chemical Defense Hypothesis (chemical deterrence is primary), only S. toxica should reduce predation, while S. innocua, being non-toxic but visually similar, should not reduce predation relative to undecorated crabs. Therefore the prediction is:\n$$\np_{U} \\approx p_{I} > p_{T}.\n$$\n\nTo rigorously distinguish these hypotheses, the experiment must:\n- Control visual appearance while varying chemical deterrence (match color, size, texture across treatments while changing toxicity).\n- Include an undecorated baseline to detect any general effect of decoration itself.\n- Ensure independence of predator decisions across replicates to avoid order effects, learning, or interference.\n\nEvaluate each option relative to these requirements:\n- Option A compares $p_{U}$ and $p_{T}$ only. A difference $p_{U} > p_{T}$ cannot be attributed uniquely to crypsis or chemical defense because both visual and chemical properties differ simultaneously; thus it does not discriminate the hypotheses.\n- Option B compares $p_{T}$ to crabs with brightly colored beads. This fails visual matching, confounding visibility with chemical deterrence; it cannot attribute differences specifically to chemistry versus crypsis.\n- Option C compares $p_{U}$, $p_{I}$, and $p_{T}$ using a visually matched non-toxic control (S. innocua) and the undecorated baseline. This design directly tests the contrasting predictions $p_{U} > p_{I} \\approx p_{T}$ (crypsis) versus $p_{U} \\approx p_{I} > p_{T}$ (chemical defense), thereby rigorously distinguishing the hypotheses when replicated across independent enclosures.\n- Option D pools all treatments in one enclosure, introducing non-independence, competition, predator choice dynamics, order effects, and learning, which confound inference and reduce rigor.\n- Option E measures crab choice rather than predator response; it addresses preference, not defensive function against predation, and thus does not test the hypotheses.\n\nTherefore, the only design that effectively and rigorously distinguishes between crypsis and chemical defense while controlling confounds is the three-way comparison with a visually matched non-toxic control and an undecorated baseline, i.e., Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1830747"}, {"introduction": "The relationship between a Batesian mimic and its toxic model is a classic example of frequency-dependent selection, which can be elegantly described using mathematical models.
