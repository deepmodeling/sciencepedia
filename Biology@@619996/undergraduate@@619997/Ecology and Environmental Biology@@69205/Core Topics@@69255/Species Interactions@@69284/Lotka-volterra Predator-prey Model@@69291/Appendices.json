This moon harbors two primary species of motile organisms: a small, herbivorous creature known as the \"Crystal Crawler\" and its predator, the \"Shadow Stalker.\" The population dynamics of this system can be described by a set of coupled interactions.\n\nLet $N$ be the population size of the Crystal Crawlers and $P$ be the population size of the Shadow Stalkers.\n\nThe growth of the Crystal Crawler population is governed by two factors. In the absence of predators, their population grows at a rate directly proportional to their current numbers, with an intrinsic per-capita growth rate constant of $r = 0.4$ per year. However, predation by Shadow Stalkers causes a decline in their population. The rate of this decline is proportional to the product of the two population sizes, $N \\times P$, with an interaction coefficient of $a = 0.01$ per year per stalker.\n\nThe Shadow Stalker population dynamics are also dependent on the Crystal Crawlers. Without their prey, the Shadow Stalkers' population would decline due to natural causes, with a per-capita death rate of $m = 0.2$ per year. The consumption of Crystal Crawlers allows the Shadow Stalker population to grow. The rate of this growth is proportional to the rate at which they consume prey, with a conversion efficiency factor of $b = 0.1$. This factor represents the fraction of consumed prey biomass that is converted into new predator biomass.\n\nAssuming this system can reach a state where both populations remain constant over time, determine the non-trivial equilibrium population sizes for the Crystal Crawlers and the Shadow Stalkers.
