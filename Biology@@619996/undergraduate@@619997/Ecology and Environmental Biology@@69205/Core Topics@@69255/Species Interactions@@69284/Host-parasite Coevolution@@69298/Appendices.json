The interaction is governed by a simple gene-for-gene model involving a single locus in each species.\n\nIn the host plant, a single locus with two alleles determines resistance. The allele $R$ is dominant and codes for a receptor protein, while the allele $r$ is recessive and does not produce a functional receptor.\n\nIn the parasite fungus, a single locus with two alleles determines its ability to be detected. The allele $A$ is dominant and codes for an avirulence signal protein, while the allele $a$ is recessive and does not produce this signal protein.\n\nA successful host defense (i.e., resistance) occurs if and only if a host plant possesses at least one $R$ allele to produce the receptor, and the infecting fungus possesses at least one $A$ allele to produce the corresponding signal. All other combinations of host and parasite genotypes result in a successful infection.\n\nField surveys indicate that both populations are large, diploid, and can be modeled as being in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. The frequency of the resistance allele $R$ in the host population is 0.75. The frequency of the avirulence allele $A$ in the parasite population is 0.40.\n\nAssuming that any host is equally likely to be encountered by any parasite, calculate the overall proportion of random encounters that will result in a successful infection for the parasite. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the overall proportion of encounters that result in a successful infection. A successful infection occurs in any scenario except for the specific case of resistance. Therefore, it is easier to first calculate the probability of resistance, `P(Resistance)`, and then find the probability of infection, `P(Infection)`, using the relationship `P(Infection) = 1 - P(Resistance)`.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, resistance occurs if and only if the host has a resistant genotype (at least one $R$ allele) AND the parasite has an avirulent genotype (at least one $A$ allele). Since the encounters are random, the probabilities of the host and parasite genotypes are independent.\nTherefore, `P(Resistance) = P(Host is resistant) \\times P(Parasite is avirulent)`.\n\nLet's calculate each of these probabilities.\n\nFirst, consider the host population.\nLet $p_H$ be the frequency of the $R$ allele and $q_H$ be the frequency of the $r$ allele.\nWe are given $f(R) = 0.75$.\nSince there are only two alleles, $q_H = f(r) = 1 - p_H = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$.\n\nThe host is resistant if its genotype is $RR$ or $Rr$. The host is susceptible only if its genotype is $rr$. Since the population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), we can calculate the frequency of the susceptible genotype $rr$ as $f(rr) = q_H^2$.\nThe probability that a randomly chosen host is resistant, `P(Host is resistant)`, is $1 - f(rr)$.\nSymbolically, `P(Host is resistant)` = $1 - q_H^2$.\nSubstituting the value of $q_H$:\n`P(Host is resistant)` = $1 - (0.25)^2 = 1 - 0.0625 = 0.9375$.\n\nNext, consider the parasite population.\nLet $p_P$ be the frequency of the $A$ allele and $q_P$ be the frequency of the $a$ allele.\nWe are given $f(A) = 0.40$.\nSince there are only two alleles, $q_P = f(a) = 1 - p_P = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\n\nThe parasite is avirulent (i.e., it can be detected by a resistant host) if its genotype is $AA$ or $Aa$. The parasite is virulent (stealthy) if its genotype is $aa$. Since the population is in HWE, the frequency of the virulent genotype $aa$ is $f(aa) = q_P^2$.\nThe probability that a randomly chosen parasite is avirulent, `P(Parasite is avirulent)`, is $1 - f(aa)$.\nSymbolically, `P(Parasite is avirulent)` = $1 - q_P^2$.\nSubstituting the value of $q_P$:\n`P(Parasite is avirulent)` = $1 - (0.60)^2 = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64$.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of a resistant interaction.\n`P(Resistance) = P(Host is resistant) \\times P(Parasite is avirulent)`\n`P(Resistance) = (1 - q_H^2) \\times (1 - q_P^2)`\n`P(Resistance) = 0.9375 \\times 0.64 = 0.60`.\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability of a successful infection.\n`P(Infection) = 1 - P(Resistance)`\n`P(Infection) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40`.\n\nThe question asks for the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n`0.40` can be written as `0.4000` to satisfy this requirement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4000}$$", "id": "1938917"}, {"introduction": "When host and parasite populations are locked in an evolutionary struggle, their gene frequencies rarely remain static.

Genotypes $rr$ are susceptible to all pathogen strains, while plants with at least one $R$ allele are resistant unless infected by a pathogen carrying the $v$ allele.\n\nOver the course of the study, researchers tracked the frequencies of the resistance allele $R$ in the grass population and the virulence allele $v$ in the pathogen population. The data revealed a distinct pattern:\n1.  The frequency of the host resistance allele $R$ was not static; it oscillated, rising to a peak and then falling to a trough, with a period of approximately 150 generations.\n2.  The frequency of the parasite virulence allele $v$ also oscillated with a similar period.\n3.  Crucially, the peaks in the frequency of the parasite's $v$ allele were consistently observed to occur approximately 20-25 generations after the peaks in the frequency of the host's $R$ allele.

The evolution of virulence is a central question in disease ecology, governed by a fundamental trade-off between the parasite's replication and its transmission. This practice [@problem_id:1938915] explores how a parasite's transmission strategyâpassing from parent to offspring (vertically) versus spreading among unrelated individuals (horizontally)âprofoundly shapes the optimal level of virulence, highlighting that evolutionary pressures are highly dependent on life history context.", "problem": "Consider a population of insect hosts susceptible to a bacterial parasite that exists in two distinct strains, Strain A and Strain B. The strains are genetically identical except for the genes controlling their mode of transmission.\n\n- **Strain A** is transmitted exclusively *vertically*. The bacteria are passed from a mother insect to her offspring during egg development. For a successful transmission to occur, the mother host must survive long enough to reproduce.\n- **Strain B** is transmitted exclusively *horizontally*. The bacteria replicate within a host and are released into the environment upon the host's death, where they can infect new, unrelated individuals in the population.\n\nIn this system, virulence is defined as the harm inflicted upon the host by the parasite, which is directly proportional to the parasite's replication rate within that host. A higher replication rate leads to a greater reduction in the host's lifespan and total reproductive output, but it also produces a larger number of transmissible bacterial progeny.\n\nGiven these conditions, which of the following statements best describes the expected outcome of natural selection acting on the virulence of these two strains?\n\nA. Strain A will evolve to be more virulent than Strain B because its direct inheritance ensures its presence in the next generation, removing the need for host preservation.\n\nB. Strain B will evolve to be more virulent than Strain A because its fitness is linked to maximizing transmission before or upon host death, which is decoupled from the host's own reproductive success.\n\nC. Both strains will evolve towards negligible virulence, as causing any harm to the host is ultimately detrimental to the parasite's long-term survival.\n\nD. The two strains will evolve to have identical levels of virulence, as the host's immune response, not the transmission mode, is the primary selective pressure on the parasite.\n\nE. Strain A will evolve to be more virulent than Strain B because it does not have to compete with other parasites for new hosts, allowing it to exploit its host more aggressively.", "solution": "Define virulence by a parameter $\\alpha$ proportional to the parasiteâs within-host replication rate. Natural selection favors the value of $\\alpha$ that maximizes the strainâs basic reproductive success $R_{0}$ given its transmission mode.\n\nFor Strain A (vertical transmission), an infected mother produces infected offspring with expected number\n$$\nR_{V}(\\alpha)=\\tau_{V}(\\alpha)\\,F(\\alpha),\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{V}(\\alpha)\\in[0,1]$ is the per-offspring vertical transmission probability and $F(\\alpha)$ is the infected motherâs lifetime fecundity, which already incorporates survival to and through reproduction. By the problemâs assumptions, higher $\\alpha$ shortens lifespan and reduces total reproduction, so $F'(\\alpha)<0$.

Hence\n$$\nR_{V}'(\\alpha)=\\tau_{V}'(\\alpha)F(\\alpha)+\\tau_{V}(\\alpha)F'(\\alpha).\n$$\nBecause $F'(\\alpha)<0$ and $\\tau_{V}$ is bounded (and commonly near $1$ even at low $\\alpha$), the negative term $\\tau_{V}(\\alpha)F'(\\alpha)$ dominates unless $\\tau_{V}'(\\alpha)$ is implausibly large. Therefore, selection on vertically transmitted parasites generally favors lower virulence, with the optimum at or near $\\alpha_{V}^{*}\\to 0$, since parasite fitness is tied directly to host survival and reproduction.\n\nFor Strain B (horizontal transmission), a standard epidemiological trade-off captures that higher $\\alpha$ both increases transmission rate and increases disease-induced mortality.

In this system, transmission occurs upon or before host death, so increased virulence can directly enhance the production and release of infectious progeny even as it shortens host lifespan.\n\nComparing the two, vertical transmission ties parasite fitness to host reproductive success and thus selects for reduced virulence, whereas horizontal transmission allows an exploitationâtransmission trade-off with an optimal positive virulence. Therefore $\\alpha_{H}^{*}>\\alpha_{V}^{*}$, implying the horizontally transmitted Strain B evolves to be more virulent than the vertically transmitted Strain A.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is false: vertical transmission favors lower, not higher, virulence because parasite fitness depends on host survival and reproduction.\n- B is correct: horizontal transmission selects for higher virulence relative to vertical because fitness is decoupled from host reproduction and can be maximized by increased exploitation up to the trade-off optimum.\n- C is false: the trade-off predicts an intermediate optimum for horizontal transmission, not negligible virulence.\n- D is false: transmission mode is a primary selective driver of virulence evolution; identical immune environments do not force identical virulence.\n- E is false: the lack of competition for new hosts does not remove the dependence of vertical transmission on host reproduction; it still disfavors high virulence.\n\nThus, the best choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1938915"}]}
