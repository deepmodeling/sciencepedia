This first practice places you in the role of a field researcher analyzing the results of a classic competition experiment [@problem_id:1848380]. By comparing how a native plant's growth responds to the removal of an invasive competitor, the addition of limiting nutrients, and the neutralization of potential toxins, you will learn to parse complex data to identify the dominant competitive mechanisms at play in a realistic ecological scenario.", "problem": "An ecologist is investigating the competitive interactions between an invasive reed, *Arundo donax* (Species A), and a native willow, *Salix laevigata* (Species B), along a riverbank. The soil in the study area is known to be poor in available nitrogen. To determine the nature of the competition, the ecologist sets up four types of experimental plots, each with an area of 1 square meter. After one growing season, the total dry biomass of Species B is measured in each plot.\n\nThe experimental treatments and the resulting mean biomass of Species B are as follows:\n\n1.  **Control (C):** Species A and Species B are allowed to grow together naturally.\n    -   Final biomass of Species B: 120 g/m²\n\n2.  **Removal (R):** All individuals of Species A are manually removed at the beginning of the season, allowing Species B to grow without its competitor.\n    -   Final biomass of Species B: 300 g/m²\n\n3.  **Nutrient Addition (N):** Species A and Species B grow together, but the plot is regularly fertilized with a nitrogen-based solution, ensuring that nitrogen is not a limiting resource.\n    -   Final biomass of Species B: 250 g/m²\n\n4.  **Carbon Addition (B for Block):** Species A and Species B grow together, but activated carbon is added to the soil. Activated carbon is known to adsorb and neutralize large organic molecules, such as allelopathic chemicals, without significantly altering nutrient availability.\n    -   Final biomass of Species B: 150 g/m²\n\nBased on these results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate interpretation of the competitive interaction between *Arundo donax* and *Salix laevigata*?\n\nA. Exploitative competition for nitrogen is the dominant competitive mechanism, but interference competition (allelopathy) is also occurring.\n\nB. Interference competition (allelopathy) is the dominant competitive mechanism, but exploitative competition for nitrogen is also occurring.\n\nC. The only form of competition occurring between the two species is exploitative competition for nitrogen.\n\nD. The only form of competition occurring between the two species is interference competition (allelopathy).\n\nE. The two species do not appear to be in competition, and the observed differences in biomass are likely due to random environmental variation.\n\nF. The experiment is fundamentally flawed because adding fertilizer and carbon alters soil chemistry, making it impossible to draw conclusions about competition.", "solution": "Define the observed mean biomass of Species B under each treatment as:\n$$\nB_{C}=120,\\quad B_{R}=300,\\quad B_{N}=250,\\quad B_{B}=150\n$$\nwhere $C$ is control (A and B together, nitrogen limited), $R$ is removal of A (no direct competition from A), $N$ is nitrogen addition (A and B together, nitrogen non-limiting), and $B$ denotes activated carbon addition (A and B together, allelochemicals adsorbed, nutrients not significantly altered).\n\nPrinciple: \n- If exploitative competition for nitrogen is important, then alleviating nitrogen limitation should increase $B$’s biomass when A is present; i.e., $B_{N}\\gg B_{C}$, and in the ideal case of nitrogen being the only limiting competitive resource, $B_{N}$ should approach $B_{R}$.\n- If interference competition via allelopathy is important, then neutralizing allelochemicals should increase $B$’s biomass with A present; i.e., $B_{B}\\gg B_{C}$, and if allelopathy were the only mechanism, $B_{B}$ should approach $B_{R}$.\n- If neither mechanism is important, then treatments would not meaningfully change biomass relative to control.\n\nCompute effect sizes relative to control:\n$$\n\\Delta_{R}=B_{R}-B_{C}=300-120=180,\\quad \\Delta_{N}=B_{N}-B_{C}=250-120=130,\\quad \\Delta_{B}=B_{B}-B_{C}=150-120=30.\n$$\nInterpretation:\n1) Nitrogen addition effect is large:\n$$\n\\Delta_{N}=130,\\quad \\frac{\\Delta_{N}}{\\Delta_{R}}=\\frac{130}{180}=\\frac{13}{18},\n$$\nshowing that removing nitrogen limitation recovers a large fraction of the total suppression caused by A in control conditions. This strongly supports exploitative competition for nitrogen as a dominant mechanism.\n\n2) Activated carbon effect is small:\n$$\n\\Delta_{B}=30,\\quad \\frac{\\Delta_{B}}{\\Delta_{R}}=\\frac{30}{180}=\\frac{1}{6},\n$$\nshowing only a modest recovery when allelopathic compounds are adsorbed under otherwise nitrogen-limited conditions. This indicates that allelopathy occurs but is not the dominant mechanism.\n\n3) Residual suppression with nitrogen abundant:\n$$\nB_{R}-B_{N}=300-250=50,\\quad \\frac{B_{R}-B_{N}}{\\Delta_{R}}=\\frac{50}{180}=\\frac{5}{18},\n$$\nshowing that even when nitrogen is not limiting, Species B remains suppressed relative to the no-competitor condition, implying an additional non-nitrogen mechanism (e.g., interference such as allelopathy or other forms of interference like light preemption). The small but positive effect of activated carbon further supports the presence of allelopathy.\n\nLogical elimination of options:\n- C and D are excluded because both mechanisms are implicated: nitrogen competition is evidenced by the large $\\Delta_{N}$, and interference is evidenced by $B_{N}<B_{R}$ and the positive $\\Delta_{B}$.\n- B is excluded because the dominant effect is nitrogen competition, not allelopathy, as shown by $\\Delta_{N}\\gg\\Delta_{B}$.\n- E is excluded because treatment effects are substantial and systematic relative to control.\n- F is excluded given the problem’s stipulation that activated carbon does not significantly alter nutrient availability and fertilizer removes nitrogen limitation; the design allows meaningful inference.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is that exploitative competition for nitrogen is the dominant mechanism, with interference (including allelopathy) also occurring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1848380"}, {"introduction": "Ecological theory provides powerful tools for predicting the outcomes of competition before they happen. This practice moves from observation to prediction by introducing you to Tilman's resource-ratio theory [@problem_id:1848418].

This exercise highlights how a species' physiological traits determine its success in exploitative competition.", "problem": "In a controlled laboratory bioreactor, two species of phytoplankton, Species A and Species B, are grown together. Their growth is limited by a single essential nutrient, phosphate. The population dynamics of each species can be described by Monod kinetics, where the specific growth rate $\\mu$ (in units of day$^{-1}$) depends on the ambient phosphate concentration $R$ (in units of µmol/L). Each species also has a constant, density-independent mortality rate $m$ (in units of day$^{-1}$).\n\nThe parameters for the two species are as follows:\n- **Species A (a rapid-uptake specialist):**\n  - Maximum specific growth rate, $\\mu_{max,A} = 1.2 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n  - Half-saturation constant for growth, $K_A = 15 \\text{ µmol/L}$\n  - Mortality rate, $m_A = 0.3 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n\n- **Species B (a resource-storage specialist, or gleaner):**\n  - Maximum specific growth rate, $\\mu_{max,B} = 0.6 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n  - Half-saturation constant for growth, $K_B = 3 \\text{ µmol/L}$\n  - Mortality rate, $m_B = 0.1 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n\nThe bioreactor is maintained as a well-mixed system where the limiting nutrient, phosphate, is supplied not continuously, but in a series of pulses. The pulsing regime is characterized by a high frequency and a low amplitude, meaning small amounts of phosphate are added very often. This regime maintains a fluctuating, but never very high, concentration of the limiting nutrient in the water.\n\nAssuming no other limiting factors, predation, or interference competition, predict the long-term outcome of the competition between these two species under this specific nutrient supply regime.\n\nA.

When nutrient supply fluctuates with high frequency and low amplitude, the resource concentration remains low and close to a quasi-steady level; the outcome closely matches the continuous-supply case governed by $R^{\\ast}$.\n\nUsing the given parameters,\n$$\nR_{A}^{\\ast}=\\frac{m_{A}K_{A}}{\\mu_{\\max,A}-m_{A}}=\\frac{0.3\\times 15}{1.2-0.3}=5,\n\\qquad\nR_{B}^{\\ast}=\\frac{m_{B}K_{B}}{\\mu_{\\max,B}-m_{B}}=\\frac{0.1\\times 3}{0.6-0.1}=0.6.\n$$\nThus $R_{B}^{\\ast}<R_{A}^{\\ast}$. Under high-frequency, low-amplitude pulsing that keeps phosphate concentrations low and never very high, the system is maintained near low $R$ where Species B, the gleaner with lower $R^{\\ast}$, has positive net growth while Species A does not.

This final exercise explores the economic trade-offs that govern such behaviors [@problem_id:1848431]. By modeling the energetic gains and losses for a bird defending a food patch, you will determine the precise \"indifference point\"—the level of resource richness at which fighting ceases to be the most profitable strategy. This practice reveals that competitive strategies are not fixed, but are dynamic decisions shaped by the costs and benefits of the environment.", "problem": "In a forest ecosystem, a territorial species of bird, the Sun-chaser, defends patches of nectar-producing flowers from an intruding subordinate species, the Nectar-thief. A researcher models the energetic trade-offs for a single Sun-chaser bird over a fixed period, $T$, that it spends in a given patch.\n\nThe quality of a patch is quantified by a dimensionless parameter $Q$, where $Q > 0$. The Sun-chaser's energetic intake rate from foraging is directly proportional to the patch quality. When foraging alone, its intake rate is $I_0 = kQ$, where $k$ is a constant with units of energy per time.\n\nThe Sun-chaser can adopt one of two strategies upon the arrival of a Nectar-thief:\n\n1.  **Aggressive Strategy:** The Sun-chaser spends a time $t_a$ actively chasing the Nectar-thief away. This aggression is assumed to be completely successful, leaving the Sun-chaser to forage alone for the remaining time, $T - t_a$. The time required for this aggression is itself dependent on the patch quality, as richer patches are more fiercely contested by the intruder. This relationship is modeled as $t_a = \\beta Q$, where $\\beta$ is a constant with units of time. Aggressive behavior incurs an additional energetic cost rate of $C_a$ (energy per time) on top of the bird's basal metabolic rate, $B$. This additional cost is only incurred during the time $t_a$.\n\n2.  **Tolerant Strategy:** The Sun-chaser forgoes aggression and shares the patch. It forages for the entire period $T$, but due to exploitative competition from the Nectar-thief, its energetic intake rate is reduced to a fraction of the solitary rate: $I_s = \\alpha I_0$, where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless competition coefficient with $0 < \\alpha < 1$. No additional energetic costs beyond the basal metabolic rate, $B$, are incurred in this strategy.\n\nThe researcher is interested in the \"indifference point,\" which is the specific patch quality, $Q_{ind}$, at which the net energetic gain for the Sun-chaser is identical for both strategies.
