Simply adding fungal spores to a field does not always lead to success. This practice challenges you to think like an agroecologist, identifying potential reasons for the failure of mycorrhizal inoculation by considering the interplay of soil chemistry, biological competition, and management practices. [@problem_id:1865658]", "problem": "A farmer is attempting to adopt more sustainable agricultural practices by reducing synthetic fertilizer use. Based on advice from an agricultural extension service, the farmer decides to inoculate their corn (Zea mays) field with a commercial blend of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The goal is to establish a symbiosis where the fungi extend the root system's reach, improving water and nutrient uptake, especially phosphorus, in exchange for carbohydrates from the plant. The farmer purchases a reputable commercial inoculum and applies it according to the manufacturer's instructions during planting.\n\nHowever, at the end of the growing season, a root analysis shows very poor colonization by the AMF, and the corn yield is no different from a neighboring, uninoculated control plot that received the same low-fertilizer treatment.\n\nWhich of the following factors, if true about the farmer's field and practices, could be valid explanations for the failure of the AMF inoculation to establish a successful symbiosis? Select all that apply.\n\nA. The soil in the field has a naturally high concentration of plant-available phosphorus due to years of previous conventional fertilization.\n\nB. The field is managed under a no-till regimen, where the soil structure has been left undisturbed for several years.\n\nC. The commercial inoculum used was a generalist AMF strain, but the field contains a highly competitive and well-adapted native AMF community.\n\nD. A broad-spectrum fungicide was applied to the soil a month before planting to manage a residual pathogen from the previous season's crop.\n\nE. The corn variety grown is a hybrid specifically bred for high yield under low-light conditions.", "solution": "We analyze each option against established principles of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and agronomic practice.\n\nAMF colonization of roots is strongly regulated by plant nutrient status, particularly phosphorus. When plant-available phosphorus is high, plants reduce carbon allocation to AMF and downregulate signaling (for example, lower strigolactone exudation) and symbiotic interfaces, leading to reduced or negligible colonization and benefits. Therefore, if the field has high plant-available phosphorus, inoculation often fails to establish a meaningful symbiosis and yields remain unchanged. Thus A is a valid explanation.\n\nNo-till management generally maintains soil structure and preserves native mycorrhizal hyphal networks and propagules. This tends to favor AMF presence and colonization, not suppress it. While no-till can make added inoculum unnecessary because a functional native AMF community already exists, it does not by itself explain poor colonization or failure of symbiosis establishment; if anything, it supports AMF. Therefore B is not a valid explanation for the observed failure.\n\nCompetition with a well-adapted native AMF community is a well-documented reason that commercial inocula fail to establish; native strains can occupy infection sites and resources, outcompeting generalist or nonlocal inoculum strains. This can result in no additional colonization by the introduced AMF and no yield response relative to an uninoculated control. Hence C is a valid explanation for inoculum failure to establish.\n\nBroad-spectrum fungicides often have non-target effects that suppress or kill AMF propagules and hyphae. Residual activity from an application a month before planting can reduce viability of both native and introduced AMF, yielding poor colonization and no symbiotic benefit. Thus D is a valid explanation.\n\nBreeding for high yield under low-light conditions is not inherently related to mycorrhizal responsiveness. While plant genotype can influence AMF responsiveness, the trait specified (low-light yield) does not provide a mechanistic basis for suppressed AMF colonization or inoculum failure. Therefore E is not a valid explanation.\n\nCombining these assessments, the options that could validly explain failure of the AMF inoculation to establish a successful symbiosis are A, C, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "1865658"}, {"introduction": "Observing that plants grow better with mycorrhizae is one thing, but how do scientists prove that the plant is actually \"feeding\" the fungus?

Their goal is to quantify the extent to which a dominant grass species, *Festuca arundinacea*, directly provides recently assimilated carbon to a specific species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, *Rhizophagus irregularis*. To achieve this, they conduct a field experiment using a technique known as Stable Isotope Probing (SIP).\n\nAn airtight, transparent chamber is placed over a patch of the grassland dominated by *F. arundinacea*. For a period of 72 hours, the atmosphere within the chamber is continuously replenished with carbon dioxide enriched with the heavy isotope carbon-13 ($^{\\text{13}}\\text{CO}_2$). An adjacent, identical patch of grassland serves as a control and is enclosed in a similar chamber but supplied with air containing carbon dioxide with the natural abundance of isotopes (predominantly $^{\\text{12}}\\text{C}$).\n\nFollowing the labeling period, soil samples containing the plant roots and fungal hyphae are collected from the center of both the labeled and control plots. Total deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is extracted from these soil samples.
