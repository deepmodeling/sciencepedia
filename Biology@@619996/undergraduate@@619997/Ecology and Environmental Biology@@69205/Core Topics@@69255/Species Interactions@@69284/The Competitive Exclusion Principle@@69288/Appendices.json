The ecologist conducts a series of experiments in controlled lab environments, maintaining identical conditions of temperature, light, and initial nutrient supply. The results of the experiments are as follows:\n\n- **Experiment 1**: When *Protozoan alpha* is cultured alone, its population grows and stabilizes at a density of approximately 800 cells per milliliter.\n- **Experiment 2**: When *Protozoan beta* is cultured alone, its population grows and stabilizes at a density of approximately 550 cells per milliliter.\n- **Experiment 3**: When equal numbers of *Protozoan alpha* and *Protozoan beta* are introduced into the same culture, the population of *Protozoan alpha* grows and stabilizes at a density near 800 cells per milliliter, while the population of *Protozoan beta* declines and is eventually eliminated from the culture.\n\nBased on these results, which species is the superior competitor, and which experiment serves as the definitive demonstration of the principle of competitive exclusion?\n\nA.

In the field, simply observing that one species is absent where another thrives is not enough to prove competitive exclusion.

[@problem_id:1886294]", "problem": "An ecologist is studying plant distribution on serpentine soils, which are known for their challenging chemical composition. They observe a specific serpentine outcrop, \"Mount Jasper,\" where a dense, uniform cover of Evergreen Wiregrass (*Aristida perennis*) dominates.

The ecologist measures soil pH, water potential, and heavy metal concentrations on Mount Jasper and finds they are all within the known tolerance range for *P. serpentina*.\n\nTo investigate this observation, the ecologist proposes an experiment based on the hypothesis that the absence of *P. serpentina* is due to competitive exclusion by *A. perennis*.

State the premise about abiotic conditions: The ecologist measured soil pH, water potential, and heavy metal concentrations on Mount Jasper and determined they fall within the known tolerance range of Serpentine Bluegrass. Therefore, abiotic stress via these measured factors is unlikely to be the primary cause of absence. This sets up a test of a biotic mechanism—competition.\n\n2. State the hypothesis: The proposed mechanism is competitive exclusion by Evergreen Wiregrass. The competitive exclusion principle predicts that when two species compete for the same limiting resources, the inferior competitor will be excluded in the presence of the superior competitor; conversely, removal of the superior competitor should release the inferior competitor from suppression.\n\n3. Derive predictions from the hypothesis: If competitive exclusion by Evergreen Wiregrass is preventing establishment of Serpentine Bluegrass, then:\n   - In plots where Evergreen Wiregrass remains (control), Serpentine Bluegrass should exhibit reduced establishment, survival, and growth due to continued competition for limiting resources such as light, water, or nutrients.\n   - In plots where Evergreen Wiregrass is removed (treatment), competitive pressure is relaxed, so Serpentine Bluegrass should show higher germination, survival, and growth, provided seeds are available and abiotic conditions are within tolerance (which is established by measurements).\n\n4. Connect design elements to inference: Equal seeding of Serpentine Bluegrass into both control and treatment plots controls for seed limitation. Thus, differences in establishment between treatments can be attributed to the presence or absence of the competitor, not to dispersal limitation.\n\n5. Evaluate alternative outcomes:\n   - Outcome B (failure in both) would imply either abiotic unsuitability, seed inviability, or other biotic constraints (e.g., pathogens, herbivory) that are independent of competition, contradicting the competitive exclusion hypothesis as the primary mechanism.\n   - Outcome C (success in both) would indicate that competition from Evergreen Wiregrass is not limiting, contradicting the hypothesis.\n   - Outcome D (success only in controls) is the opposite of the competitive exclusion prediction.\n   - Outcome E (Evergreen Wiregrass more abundant in treatment) is inconsistent with its removal and with the timeframe; it cannot become more abundant than in undisturbed controls as a direct consequence of removal.\n\n6. Select the outcome that matches the prediction: The expected result under the competitive exclusion hypothesis is higher establishment of Serpentine Bluegrass in the treatment plots and little to none in the control plots.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1886294"}]}
