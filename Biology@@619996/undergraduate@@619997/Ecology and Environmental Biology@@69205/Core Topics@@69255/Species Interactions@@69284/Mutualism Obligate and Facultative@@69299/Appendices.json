{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the nature of species interactions is fundamental to ecology. This first exercise provides a classic scenario to practice distinguishing between mutualistic relationships that are beneficial versus those that are essential for survival. By analyzing the relationship between a salamander and a protective bacterium, you will learn to apply the definition of facultative mutualism, paying close attention to the role of environmental context in shaping species dependencies [@problem_id:1865370].", "problem": "In ecological studies, interactions between species are categorized based on their outcomes. A **mutualism** is a relationship where both species benefit. This can be further divided into two types. In an **obligate mutualism**, at least one of the species is unable to survive without its partner. In a **facultative mutualism**, the species benefit from the interaction but are not dependent on it for survival. Other interactions include **commensalism**, where one species benefits and the other is unaffected, and **parasitism**, where one species benefits at the expense of the other.\n\nConsider the rough-skinned newt, *Taricha granulosa*. In its natural habitat, its skin is colonized by the bacterium *Janthinobacterium lividum*. This bacterium produces a compound called violacein, which is highly effective at inhibiting the growth of the lethal skin fungus *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*, a major cause of amphibian decline worldwide. The bacterium, in turn, gains a stable habitat and nutrients from the newt's skin secretions. However, scientists have successfully raised and maintained healthy populations of *Taricha granulosa* in sterile laboratory environments that are completely free of both the bacterium and the fungus.\n\nBased on the information provided, how would you classify the relationship for the *Taricha granulosa* newt?\n\nA. Obligate mutualism\n\nB. Facultative mutualism\n\nC. Commensalism\n\nD. Parasitism", "solution": "We begin by identifying the interaction outcomes. The bacterium Janthinobacterium lividum produces violacein that inhibits the lethal fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on the newt’s skin, which benefits the newt by reducing disease risk. The bacterium gains habitat and nutrients from the newt’s skin secretions. Therefore, both species benefit, satisfying the definition of mutualism.\n\nNext, we distinguish between obligate and facultative mutualism. In an obligate mutualism, at least one partner cannot survive without the other. The problem states that scientists have raised and maintained healthy populations of Taricha granulosa in sterile laboratory environments free of both the bacterium and the fungus. This demonstrates that the newt does not depend on the bacterium for survival, so the interaction is not obligate for the newt.\n\nCommensalism is excluded because the newt clearly benefits (disease protection), not merely remains unaffected. Parasitism is excluded because the bacterium does not harm the newt; it benefits it.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and with specific reference to the newt, the relationship is a facultative mutualism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1865370"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to a beneficial but non-essential relationship, some species become so intertwined that one cannot survive without the other. This practice explores a striking example of obligate mutualism that has been shaped not by natural co-evolution, but by human-driven artificial selection. Examining the relationship between domesticated sheep and humans will challenge you to identify an instance where an interaction has become a biological necessity for one of the partners [@problem_id:1865414].", "problem": "Through centuries of artificial selection, humans have bred domestic sheep (*Ovis aries*) to produce exceptionally thick, dense fleece that grows continuously. Unlike their wild ancestors who would naturally shed their winter coats, modern domestic sheep have largely lost this ability. Without regular shearing by humans, the fleece becomes excessively heavy and matted. This can lead to a range of severe health problems for the sheep, including overheating (hyperthermia) during warm months, impaired movement, and a higher risk of parasitic infections on the skin, a condition known as fly-strike. Humans, in turn, harvest the sheared wool as a valuable textile resource.\n\nFrom the perspective of the modern domestic sheep, which of the following terms best classifies its relationship with the humans who shear it?\n\nA. Obligate Mutualism\n\nB. Facultative Mutualism\n\nC. Commensalism\n\nD. Parasitism", "solution": "We classify interspecific interactions by whether each partner is helped, harmed, or unaffected, and by whether the interaction is necessary for survival or reproduction.\n\n- Parasitism: one species benefits while the other is harmed. Here, shearing mitigates overheating, impaired movement, and fly-strike in sheep, so the sheep are not harmed by humans; this option is eliminated.\n- Commensalism: one benefits and the other is unaffected. Humans clearly benefit (wool harvest), so the human partner is not unaffected; this option is eliminated.\n- Mutualism: both benefit. Sheep benefit via essential health maintenance; humans benefit via wool.\n  - Facultative mutualism: both benefit but neither strictly requires the interaction to survive/reproduce. Domestic sheep have largely lost the ability to shed; without shearing they suffer severe health consequences and may die. From the sheep’s perspective, assistance is necessary; thus this is not merely facultative.\n  - Obligate mutualism: at least from the sheep’s perspective, the relationship is necessary to avoid serious morbidity/mortality due to continuous fleece growth. Given the prompt’s explicit statement that modern domestic sheep have largely lost the ability to shed and need regular shearing to avoid severe problems, the interaction is obligate for the sheep.\n\nTherefore, from the perspective of the modern domestic sheep, the best classification is obligate mutualism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1865414"}, {"introduction": "While the categories of \"facultative\" and \"obligate\" are useful, many real-world interactions fall somewhere on a spectrum between the two. This exercise moves beyond simple classification to a quantitative analysis of dependency using a hypothetical paleoecological scenario based on fossil evidence. By calculating a \"Pollinator Dependency Index,\" you will learn how to use probabilistic and fitness-based models to measure the strength of a mutualistic relationship and appreciate its nuances [@problem_id:1865399].", "problem": "Paleoecologists are studying fossil evidence of a co-evolved plant-insect pair from the late Cretaceous period. The extinct plant, designated *Glossoflora singularis*, possesses reproductive structures that are a near-perfect morphological match for the highly specialized mouthparts of an extinct pollinating insect, *Proboscis longus*. This suggests a strong, specialized interaction. However, analysis of *Glossoflora*'s fossilized flowers also reveals features consistent with a capacity for autogamy (self-pollination).\n\nTo quantify the nature of this mutualism, ecologists model the reproductive success of the plant. The model assumes that in any given reproductive cycle, a plant is either cross-pollinated by the insect or it is not. If not visited by the insect, it may still achieve self-pollination. The following parameters are estimated from the fossil record and population models:\n\n- $S_I$: The average number of viable seeds produced by a plant following a successful cross-pollination by *Proboscis longus*.\n- $S_S$: The average number of viable seeds produced by a plant following a successful self-pollination event, which is lower than $S_I$ due to inbreeding depression.\n- $P_I$: The probability that a plant is successfully visited and pollinated by *Proboscis longus* during its flowering season.\n- $P_S$: The probability that a plant which was *not* visited by the insect successfully self-pollinates.\n\nEcologists define a \"Pollinator Dependency Index\" ($D$) for the plant, which represents the fraction of the plant's total expected reproductive output (average number of seeds per plant in the population) that is directly attributable to pollination by the insect.\n\nBased on extensive analysis, the accepted model parameters are:\n- $S_I = 150$ viable seeds\n- $S_S = 40$ viable seeds\n- $P_I = 0.60$\n- $P_S = 0.75$\n\nCalculate the Pollinator Dependency Index, $D$, for *Glossoflora singularis*. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Define $D$ as the fraction of the plant’s total expected seed production attributable to insect pollination. The reproductive outcomes are mutually exclusive: either the plant is cross-pollinated by the insect or, if not, it may self-pollinate. By the law of total expectation, the total expected seeds per plant is the sum over these mutually exclusive events of the product of event probability and corresponding seed yield.\n\nLet the expected contribution from insect pollination be\n$$\nE_{\\text{insect}} = P_{I} S_{I}.\n$$\nIf the plant is not visited by the insect, which occurs with probability $(1 - P_{I})$, it may self-pollinate with probability $P_{S}$ and produce $S_{S}$ seeds. Hence the expected contribution from selfing is\n$$\nE_{\\text{self}} = (1 - P_{I}) P_{S} S_{S}.\n$$\nTherefore, the total expected seed production is\n$$\nE_{\\text{total}} = E_{\\text{insect}} + E_{\\text{self}} = P_{I} S_{I} + (1 - P_{I}) P_{S} S_{S}.\n$$\nBy definition, the Pollinator Dependency Index is the fraction attributable to the insect:\n$$\nD = \\frac{E_{\\text{insect}}}{E_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{P_{I} S_{I}}{P_{I} S_{I} + (1 - P_{I}) P_{S} S_{S}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $S_{I} = 150$, $S_{S} = 40$, $P_{I} = 0.60$, and $P_{S} = 0.75$,\n$$\nD = \\frac{0.60 \\times 150}{0.60 \\times 150 + (1 - 0.60) \\times 0.75 \\times 40} = \\frac{90}{90 + 12} = \\frac{90}{102} = \\frac{15}{17}.\n$$\nConverting to a decimal and rounding to three significant figures gives\n$$\nD \\approx 0.882.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.882}$$", "id": "1865399"}]}
