This exercise guides you through calculating $R_0$ from a classic cohort life table, combining age-specific survivorship ($l_x$) and fecundity ($m_x$) to understand a population's long-term potential.

The probability that a larva survives to become a one-year-old (entering Age Class 2) is $P_1$. Larvae do not reproduce.\n-   **Age Class 2 (1-2 year olds):** These are pupae. The probability that a pupa survives to become a two-year-old (entering Age Class 3) is $P_2$. Pupae do not reproduce.\n-   **Age Class 3 (2-3 year olds):** These are adults. Adults are the only reproductive stage. After laying their eggs, they all die, so their survival probability to the next year is zero. On average, each adult produces $F_3$ new female larvae that are counted in Age Class 1 in the next year's census.\n\nThe population dynamics can be described by a Leslie matrix, $L$, which relates the number of individuals in each age class at time $t+1$ to the number of individuals at time $t$ through the equation $\\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = L \\mathbf{n}_{t}$, where $\\mathbf{n}_t = \\begin{pmatrix} N_1(t) \\\\ N_2(t) \\\\ N_3(t) \\end{pmatrix}$ is the vector of population sizes for the three age classes.\n\nConstruct the 3x3 Leslie matrix $L$ for this moth population using the parameters $P_1$, $P_2$, and $F_3$.", "solution": "We model the age-structured population with a Leslie matrix $L$ such that $\\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = L \\mathbf{n}_{t}$, where $\\mathbf{n}_{t} = \\begin{pmatrix} N_{1}(t) \\\\ N_{2}(t) \\\\ N_{3}(t) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nBy definition of a Leslie matrix:\n- The first row contains fecundities.
