For each quadrat deployed, the total number of individual barnacles, $N$, is counted.\n\nA new research assistant, tasked with calculating the mean population density from a recent survey, misinterprets the data analysis protocol. Instead of calculating density as count per unit area, the assistant establishes a procedure where, for each quadrat, they calculate a \"density index\" by dividing the number of barnacles counted ($N$) by the side length of the quadrat ($L$). They then compute the arithmetic mean of these individual \"density indices\" from all quadrats to report a single value as the final mean population density for the surveyed area.\n\nThe counts from the five quadrats in the recent survey are as follows:\n- Quadrat 1: 12 individuals\n- Quadrat 2: 8 individuals\n- Quadrat 3: 15 individuals\n- Quadrat 4: 11 individuals\n- Quadrat 5: 14 individuals\n\nYour task is to determine the magnitude of the assistant's procedural error.

A common observation is that these bushes exhibit a remarkably uniform dispersion pattern.
