The Verde River has a low-density population of approximately 1,000 individuals in a 10-kilometer stretch. The Azul River has a high-density population of 15,000 individuals in a comparable 10-kilometer stretch. A sudden, short-lived industrial accident releases a novel, water-soluble chemical into the headwaters of both rivers simultaneously. The chemical quickly reaches a uniform concentration throughout both 10-kilometer sections and is lethal to any fish that absorbs it. The chemical's molecular structure and mode of action are such that the probability of any single fish absorbing a lethal dose is constant and independent of the presence of other fish. After the event, ecologists determine that in both rivers, 40% of the *Piscis fictus* population has been killed.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best and most direct explanation for why this chemical spill is considered a density-independent limiting factor?\n\nA. Because the total number of surviving fish is greater in the Azul River than in the Verde River.\n\nB. Because the chemical spill will lead to a decrease in competition for resources in both populations, allowing for future growth.\n\nC. Because the per capita mortality rate (the proportion of the population killed) is the same regardless of the initial population density.\n\nD. Because the absolute number of fish that died was significantly larger in the Azul River (6,000) than in the Verde River (400).\n\nE.

Let $p$ be the probability that any given fish absorbs a lethal dose during the event. The problem states that $p$ is constant and independent of other fish and of density.\n\nBy the independence and constant-probability assumption, the expected number of deaths in a population of size $N$ is\n$$\nD = pN,\n$$\nso the per capita mortality rate (fraction of the population killed) is\n$$\nm = \\frac{D}{N} = \\frac{pN}{N} = p.\n$$\nTherefore, if $p$ is the same in both rivers, then the per capita mortality rates must be equal regardless of the initial density:\n$$\nm_{V} = p, \\quad m_{A} = p.\n$$\nThe observation that the same fraction of fish died in both rivers, namely $m_{V} = m_{A} = 0.40 = \\frac{2}{5}$, is consistent with and directly explained by $m = p$ being independent of density. This equality of per capita impact across different densities is the defining criterion of a density-independent limiting factor.\n\nBy contrast:\n- Statement A refers to absolute survivor counts, which do not define density independence.\n- Statement B discusses future competition dynamics, which is not the criterion for density independence.\n- Statement D highlights absolute numbers of deaths, which scale with $N$ via $D = pN$ but do not define density independence; the defining property is $m = p$ being constant.\n- Statement E speculates about neutralization, which is unnecessary given the stated mechanism and does not define density independence.\n\nThus, the best and most direct explanation is that the per capita mortality rate is the same regardless of initial density.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1838579"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical concepts to practical application is a key step in any scientific discipline.

Using raw data on coral density and mortality following a hurricane, you will apply the method of least squares to calculate a mortality rate. This practice provides hands-on experience in quantitative data analysis and hypothesis testing, skills essential for modern ecology.

Following a severe hurricane, an unusually large volume of freshwater runoff created a plume of low-salinity water over a coastal reef for 48 hours. The team suspects that the resulting osmotic stress caused coral mortality in a density-independent manner.\n\nBefore the hurricane, the team had mapped several permanent square-meter quadrats and recorded the initial density, $D$, of a particular stony coral species. After the storm, they returned to the same quadrats to count the number of dead coral colonies, $N_{dead}$.\n\nThe team hypothesizes that for a density-independent mortality factor, the number of dead colonies per unit area should be directly proportional to the initial density of colonies.

Since $m_{\\text{phage}}(t)$ is independent of $N$, the phage-imposed mortality is density-independent with respect to bacterial density. Although the total number killed per unit time, $\\alpha N P(t)$, is proportional to $N$, density dependence is determined by the per capita rate, not the total number killed.
