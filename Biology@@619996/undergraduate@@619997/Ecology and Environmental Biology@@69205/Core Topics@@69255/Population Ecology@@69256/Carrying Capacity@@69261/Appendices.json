This exercise provides a deeper, more mechanistic understanding of $K$ as an emergent property of the population's own vital rates. By analyzing how a change in per-capita fertility affects the population equilibrium, you will explore how carrying capacity is fundamentally determined by the balance between birth and death rates [@problem_id:1833823].", "problem": "A stable population of river otters in an isolated watershed is being studied. Ecologists have determined that the population dynamics can be well-described by a logistic growth model. In this context, the carrying capacity, $K$, is defined as the maximum population size that the environment can sustain indefinitely. This equilibrium is reached when the per capita birth rate of the population equals its per capita death rate.\n\nA novel, chronic, non-lethal parasite is introduced into the ecosystem and becomes endemic within the otter population. This parasite has a specific biological effect: it lodges in the reproductive system of female otters, causing a permanent reduction in their average litter size. The parasite does not affect the otters' lifespan, their vulnerability to predation, or their susceptibility to other diseases.\n\nAssuming the environment itself (e.g., food supply, habitat space) remains unchanged, what is the expected long-term effect of this fertility-reducing parasite on the carrying capacity ($K$) of the otter population?\n\nA. The carrying capacity ($K$) will increase.\n\nB. The carrying capacity ($K$) will decrease.\n\nC. The carrying capacity ($K$) will remain unchanged because the death rate is not affected.\n\nD. The carrying capacity ($K$) will fluctuate wildly and not settle at a new stable value.\n\nE. The carrying capacity ($K$) will drop to zero, causing the population to go extinct.", "solution": "Let $N(t)$ denote the population size. In a logistic model, the per capita growth rate is written as\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N}\\frac{dN}{dt}=r\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the intrinsic (low-density) per capita growth rate and $K$ is the carrying capacity. By definition, $K$ is the population size at which the per capita birth rate equals the per capita death rate.\n\nTo make the connection explicit, write the per capita birth and death rates as functions of density:\n$$\nb(N), \\quad d(N).\n$$\nThe equilibrium (carrying capacity) satisfies\n$$\nb(N^{*})=d(N^{*}).\n$$\nA standard micro-foundation of the logistic model takes linear density dependence in vital rates:\n$$\nb(N)=b_{0}-\\alpha N, \\qquad d(N)=d_{0}+\\beta N,\n$$\nwith $\\alpha\\ge 0$ and $\\beta\\ge 0$ describing density dependence in births and deaths, respectively. Then the per capita growth rate is\n$$\ng(N)=b(N)-d(N)=\\left(b_{0}-d_{0}\\right)-\\left(\\alpha+\\beta\\right)N,\n$$\nwhich matches the logistic form\n$$\ng(N)=r-\\frac{r}{K}N\n$$\nby the identifications\n$$\nr=b_{0}-d_{0}, \\qquad \\frac{r}{K}=\\alpha+\\beta \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad K=\\frac{b_{0}-d_{0}}{\\alpha+\\beta}.\n$$\n\nNow introduce the chronic, non-lethal parasite that reduces average litter size. This reduces the per capita birth rate at all densities without changing mortality or the density-dependent effects of the environment (food, space). Let the new per capita birth rate be\n$$\nb_{p}(N)=b(N)-\\Delta \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\Delta>0,\n$$\nor, equivalently, a proportional reduction $b_{p}(N)=c\\,b(N)$ with $0<c<1$. In either representation, the effect is a downward shift of the birth-rate function across all $N$. Using the linear form, this changes $b_{0}$ to $b_{0}'=b_{0}-\\Delta$ while leaving $\\alpha$, $d_{0}$, and $\\beta$ unchanged. The new equilibrium $K'$ therefore is\n$$\nK'=\\frac{b_{0}'-d_{0}}{\\alpha+\\beta}=\\frac{(b_{0}-\\Delta)-d_{0}}{\\alpha+\\beta}=K-\\frac{\\Delta}{\\alpha+\\beta},\n$$\nwhich satisfies $K'<K$ because $\\Delta>0$ and $\\alpha+\\beta>0$. The same conclusion follows under a proportional reduction, since $b_{0}'=c\\,b_{0}$ yields\n$$\nK'=\\frac{c\\,b_{0}-d_{0}}{\\alpha+\\beta}<\\frac{b_{0}-d_{0}}{\\alpha+\\beta}=K\n$$\nwhenever $c<1$.\n\nThus, by the definition of carrying capacity as the density where per capita births equal per capita deaths, a persistent reduction in per capita birth rate (with environment and death processes unchanged) lowers the equilibrium population size. The equilibrium remains stable under the same logistic density dependence, so it neither fluctuates wildly nor collapses to zero unless the reduction is so extreme that $b_{0}'\\le d_{0}$, which is not implied by the problemâ€™s description of a non-lethal fertility reduction.\n\nTherefore, the expected long-term effect is a decrease in $K$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1833823"}, {"introduction": "In natural ecosystems, environmental conditions are rarely static, meaning the carrying capacity for a population can change over time.
