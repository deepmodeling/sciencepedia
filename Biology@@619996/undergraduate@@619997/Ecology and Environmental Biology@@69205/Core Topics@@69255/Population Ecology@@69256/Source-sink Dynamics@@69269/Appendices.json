This first exercise challenges you to build a simple but powerful model for a system with a source habitat, governed by logistic growth, and a sink habitat sustained purely by immigration. By calculating the steady-state populations, you will practice the fundamental skill of finding the equilibrium point where population growth, mortality, and dispersal are in balance, a crucial first step in understanding how these connected populations persist over time [@problem_id:1881494].", "problem": "A population of green frogs inhabits a large, stable natural pond, which serves as a \"source\" habitat. The population size in this source habitat is denoted by $N_S$. The dynamics of this population are governed by logistic growth, characterized by an intrinsic annual growth rate of $r_S$ and a carrying capacity of $K_S$.\n\nEach year, a constant fraction, $d_S$, of the frog population from the source pond disperses into an adjacent suburban area. This suburban area functions as a \"sink\" habitat, as the local conditions, particularly predation by introduced fish in backyard ponds, prevent any successful frog reproduction. The total frog population in this sink area is denoted by $N_K$. All frogs that leave the source pond are assumed to arrive in the sink habitat. The frog population within the sink habitat experiences a constant annual per-capita mortality rate of $m_K$.\n\nThe system has been observed for a long time and has reached a steady state where the populations in both the source and sink habitats are stable.\n\nGiven the following parameter values:\n- Intrinsic annual growth rate in the source, $r_S = 0.50$ per year\n- Carrying capacity of the source, $K_S = 2000$ frogs\n- Dispersal fraction from the source, $d_S = 0.10$ per year\n- Per-capita mortality rate in the sink, $m_K = 0.80$ per year\n\nCalculate the number of frogs in the sink habitat at this steady state.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must first translate the described ecological dynamics into a mathematical model. We will formulate a system of two ordinary differential equations representing the rate of change of the frog populations in the source ($N_S$) and sink ($N_K$) habitats. Then, we will find the steady-state solution by setting these rates of change to zero.\n\nFirst, let's model the source population, $N_S$. The problem states its dynamics are governed by logistic growth, with an additional loss due to dispersal. The logistic growth term is $r_S N_S (1 - N_S/K_S)$. The loss due to dispersal is a fraction $d_S$ of the current population, which is a rate of $d_S N_S$. Combining these, the rate of change of the source population is:\n$$ \\frac{dN_S}{dt} = r_S N_S \\left(1 - \\frac{N_S}{K_S}\\right) - d_S N_S $$\n\nNext, let's model the sink population, $N_K$. This population increases due to immigration from the source and decreases due to mortality. The rate of immigration is equal to the rate of emigration from the source, which is $d_S N_S$. The population experiences a per-capita mortality rate of $m_K$, so the total rate of loss is $m_K N_K$. The sink has no reproduction, so there is no growth term. The rate of change of the sink population is:\n$$ \\frac{dN_K}{dt} = d_S N_S - m_K N_K $$\n\nThe problem states that the system reaches a steady state. At steady state, the populations are stable, meaning their rates of change are zero. We denote the steady-state populations as $N_S^*$ and $N_K^*$.\n$$ \\frac{dN_S}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dN_K}{dt} = 0 $$\n\nWe can now solve for the steady-state populations. Let's start with the source population equation:\n$$ r_S N_S^* \\left(1 - \\frac{N_S^*}{K_S}\\right) - d_S N_S^* = 0 $$\nWe are looking for a non-trivial solution where $N_S^* > 0$. We can divide the entire equation by $N_S^*$:\n$$ r_S \\left(1 - \\frac{N_S^*}{K_S}\\right) - d_S = 0 $$\nNow, we solve for $N_S^*$:\n$$ r_S - \\frac{r_S N_S^*}{K_S} = d_S $$\n$$ r_S - d_S = \\frac{r_S N_S^*}{K_S} $$\n$$ N_S^* = \\frac{K_S (r_S - d_S)}{r_S} = K_S \\left(1 - \\frac{d_S}{r_S}\\right) $$\n\nNow we use the steady-state condition for the sink population:\n$$ d_S N_S^* - m_K N_K^* = 0 $$\nSolving for $N_K^*$, we get:\n$$ N_K^* = \\frac{d_S}{m_K} N_S^* $$\n\nWe have an expression for $N_S^*$, which we can substitute into the equation for $N_K^*$:\n$$ N_K^* = \\frac{d_S}{m_K} \\left[ K_S \\left(1 - \\frac{d_S}{r_S}\\right) \\right] $$\n\nNow we have a final symbolic expression for the steady-state sink population. We can substitute the given numerical values: $r_S = 0.50$, $K_S = 2000$, $d_S = 0.10$, and $m_K = 0.80$.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the steady-state source population, $N_S^*$:\n$$ N_S^* = 2000 \\left(1 - \\frac{0.10}{0.50}\\right) = 2000 (1 - 0.2) = 2000(0.8) = 1600 $$\nSo, at steady state, there are 1600 frogs in the source pond.\n\nNow, we can calculate the steady-state sink population, $N_K^*$:\n$$ N_K^* = \\frac{0.10}{0.80} \\times N_S^* = \\frac{0.10}{0.80} \\times 1600 $$\n$$ N_K^* = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 1600 = 200 $$\n\nThe number of frogs in the sink habitat at steady state is 200.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{200}$$", "id": "1881494"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are powerful, but they must be tested against real-world evidence. One of the primary predictions of source-sink theory is an asymmetric pattern of dispersal, with a net flow of individuals from sources to sinks. This practice moves from abstract equations to empirical data, asking you to analyze the results of a classic mark-recapture study to determine the direction of this net flow [@problem_id:1848105]. The exercise emphasizes that it's not just the absolute number of migrants that matters, but the per-capita rate of emigration, which provides the strongest evidence for identifying source and sink habitats.", "problem": "An ecologist is investigating the population dynamics of a species of ground-nesting bird across a fragmented landscape. The landscape consists of two types of habitats: large, undisturbed \"Core\" forest patches, hypothesized to be high-quality source habitats, and small, linear \"Edge\" forest patches along agricultural fields, hypothesized to be low-quality sink habitats. According to source-sink theory, source habitats have a population growth rate greater than one ($\\lambda  1$) and exhibit a net emigration of individuals, while sink habitats have a growth rate less than one ($\\lambda  1$) and are maintained by a net immigration of individuals from sources.\n\nTo test the dispersal prediction of this theory, the ecologist conducts a large-scale mark-recapture study. In the first year, the team captures and uniquely marks 800 juvenile birds in Core patches and 600 juvenile birds in Edge patches. In the second year, extensive surveys are conducted to recapture these marked individuals. The recapture data are as follows:\n- Of the 800 birds originally marked in Core patches, 120 were recaptured within a Core patch (either their original patch or a different Core patch).\n- Of the 800 birds originally marked in Core patches, 56 were recaptured within an Edge patch.\n- Of the 600 birds originally marked in Edge patches, 72 were recaptured within an Edge patch (either their original patch or a different Edge patch).\n- Of the 600 birds originally marked in Edge patches, 18 were recaptured within a Core patch.\n\nBased on these dispersal data, which of the following conclusions is most strongly supported?\n\nA.

The data support the hypothesis that Core patches are sources and Edge patches are sinks.\n\nE. The data suggest both patch types are behaving as sinks, as the recapture rates are low in both.", "solution": "The core of this problem is to evaluate the dispersal patterns between Core and Edge habitats to test a key prediction of source-sink theory: that there is a net movement of individuals from source to sink habitats. We need to analyze the provided mark-recapture data to determine the direction and magnitude of this net movement.\n\nLet $N_C$ be the number of birds initially marked in Core patches, and $N_E$ be the number of birds initially marked in Edge patches.\nFrom the problem statement:\n$N_C = 800$\n$N_E = 600$\n\nLet $D_{C \\to E}$ be the number of birds that dispersed from Core to Edge patches.\nLet $D_{E \\to C}$ be the number of birds that dispersed from Edge to Core patches.\nFrom the recapture data:\n$D_{C \\to E} = 56$\n$D_{E \\to C} = 18$\n\nThe source-sink hypothesis predicts a net flow of individuals from source to sink habitats. Let's calculate the net dispersal between the two habitat types. The net flow of individuals from Core to Edge is the total number of dispersers from Core to Edge minus the total number of dispersers from Edge to Core.\nNet Flow = $D_{C \\to E} - D_{E \\to C} = 56 - 18 = 38$\n\nSince the result is a positive number (38), this indicates a net movement of individuals out of the Core patches and into the Edge patches. This observation is consistent with Core patches acting as sources and Edge patches acting as sinks.\n\nTo make a more rigorous comparison, we can calculate the per capita emigration rate from each patch type. This rate represents the probability that a marked individual in a given habitat type will disperse to the other habitat type.\n\nThe per capita emigration rate from Core to Edge, $e_C$, is the number of dispersers from Core to Edge divided by the initial number of birds marked in Core patches.\n$$e_C = \\frac{D_{C \\to E}}{N_C} = \\frac{56}{800}$$\n$$e_C = 0.07$$\n\nThe per capita emigration rate from Edge to Core, $e_E$, is the number of dispersers from Edge to Core divided by the initial number of birds marked in Edge patches.\n$$e_E = \\frac{D_{E \\to C}}{N_E} = \\frac{18}{600}$$\n$$e_E = 0.03$$\n\nComparing the two rates, we see that the per capita emigration rate from Core patches ($e_C = 0.07$) is more than double the per capita emigration rate from Edge patches ($e_E = 0.03$). This means that an individual bird in a Core patch is substantially more likely to disperse to an Edge patch than an individual in an Edge patch is to disperse to a Core patch. This difference in emigration pressure, along with the positive net flow of 38 individuals from Core to Edge, strongly supports the initial hypothesis.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA. The data are inconclusive because equal numbers of individuals dispersed out of both patch types. This is factually incorrect. The number of emigrants from Core was 56, while the number from Edge was 18.\nB. The data support the hypothesis that Edge patches are sources and Core patches are sinks. This is the opposite of what the data show. The net flow is from Core to Edge, not the other way around.\nC. The data are inconclusive because information on birth and death rates is required to test source-sink theory. While a complete demographic analysis of source-sink dynamics does require birth and death rates to determine if $\\lambda  1$ or $\\lambda  1$, the prediction of net emigration from sources to sinks is a critical and testable component of the theory on its own. The dispersal data provided are sufficient to test this specific prediction.\nD. The data support the hypothesis that Core patches are sources and Edge patches are sinks. This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The net dispersal is from Core to Edge, and the per capita emigration rate from Core is significantly higher than from Edge.\nE. The data suggest both patch types are behaving as sinks, as the recapture rates are low in both. Low recapture rates are expected in any mark-recapture study due to mortality, dispersal to un-surveyed areas, and imperfect detection. This does not automatically mean a habitat is a demographic sink. The crucial information here is the *asymmetry* in dispersal between the habitat types, not the overall recapture rate.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion most strongly supported by the data is that Core patches are acting as sources and Edge patches are acting as sinks.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1848105"}, {"introduction": "Sometimes, a large and stable-looking population can be a \"cryptic sink,\" entirely dependent on unseen immigration.

However, its apparent ecological isolation and periodic susceptibility to drought have led ecologists to hypothesize that Marsh A is a \"cryptic sink\". According to this hypothesis, the population in Marsh A is not self-sustaining and its stability is an illusion maintained by a continuous, one-way influx of individuals from the more resilient Pond B population, which acts as the source.\n\nTo investigate this source-sink dynamic, a population genetics study was conducted using a suite of neutral microsatellite markers. The analysis of genetic diversity provided the following two key metrics:\n1.  The average expected heterozygosity within the subpopulations (i.e., the average of the values for Marsh A and Pond B, considered separately) was calculated to be $H_S = 0.715$.\n2.
