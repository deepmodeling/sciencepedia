It represents the maximum population size that an environment can sustainably support. This first exercise provides a foundational look at how $K$ emerges directly from the interplay between per capita birth rates ($b$) and death rates ($d$), when these rates are themselves dependent on population size ($N$). By modeling a simple linear relationship, you will derive the expression for carrying capacity from first principles, solidifying your understanding of the logistic growth model.

This relationship is described by the equation $b(N) = b_0 - \\alpha N$, where $b_0$ is the intrinsic per capita birth rate and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant representing the strength of intraspecific competition. The per capita death rate, $d$ (measured in deaths per individual per year), is assumed to be constant due to factors independent of population density, and is given by $d(N) = d_c$. For a viable population to exist, it is given that $b_0 > d_c$.\n\nThe carrying capacity, $K$, is defined as the maximum stable population size that the environment can sustain, which corresponds to the non-zero equilibrium point where the population size no longer changes.\n\nDetermine the carrying capacity, $K$, for this fish population.
