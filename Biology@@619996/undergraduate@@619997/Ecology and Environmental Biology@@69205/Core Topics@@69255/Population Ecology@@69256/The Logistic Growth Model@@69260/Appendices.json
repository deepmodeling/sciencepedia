This exercise provides a practical scenario to apply the core logistic equation, helping you understand how the current population size ($N$), intrinsic growth rate ($r$), and environmental carrying capacity ($K$) interact to determine if a population will grow, and how quickly. Mastering this calculation is the first step toward predicting a population's future trajectory.

The meadow's resources, such as soil nutrients and space, are finite, and it is estimated that the carrying capacity ($K$) for this species is 2000 individual plants. A recent, thorough survey determined that the current population size ($N$) is 100 plants.\n\nTo understand the plant's intrinsic growth potential, studies were conducted under optimal laboratory conditions where resources were not limiting. In this ideal environment, the species exhibited a per-capita birth rate of $b = 0.13$ new plants per plant per year and a per-capita death rate of $d = 0.03$ deaths per plant per year.\n\nAssuming the population's growth in the meadow is governed by a logistic model, what is the current instantaneous rate of population growth ($dN/dt$)? Express your answer in units of plants per year, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the instantaneous rate of population growth, $dN/dt$, for a population following a logistic growth model.
