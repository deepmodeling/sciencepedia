This exercise explores the geometric growth model, which is ideal for populations with discrete breeding seasons, like many birds and insects. You will apply this discrete-time model to a realistic conservation scenario where a successful intervention improves growth rates, allowing you to calculate the time required to reach a target population size [@problem_id:1851594].", "problem": "A team of conservation biologists is monitoring a small, isolated population of a newly discovered species of flightless bird, the Sapphire-plumed Rail. The initial census recorded a population of 50 individuals. For the first five years of observation, the population was found to exhibit geometric growth, increasing by exactly 12% each year.\n\nAfter the initial five-year period, a comprehensive habitat restoration program was implemented. This program successfully enhanced the birds' breeding success and survival rates, causing the annual population increase to rise to 20%.\n\nAssuming the population continues to grow geometrically at this new, enhanced rate, determine the minimum number of full years after the conservation program was initiated that it will take for the rail population to first exceed 1000 individuals.", "solution": "Let the initial population be $P_{0}=50$. Geometric growth with annual multiplicative factor $(1+r)$ gives population after $t$ years as $P(t)=P_{0}(1+r)^{t}$.\n\nDuring the first five years, the rate is $r_{1}=0.12$, so the population at the start of the conservation program is\n$$\nP_{5}=P_{0}(1+r_{1})^{5}=50\\,(1.12)^{5}.\n$$\nAfter the program begins, the rate becomes $r_{2}=0.20$. After $n$ full years following the programâ€™s start, the population is\n$$\nP(n)=P_{5}(1+r_{2})^{n}=50\\,(1.12)^{5}(1.20)^{n}.\n$$\nWe need the smallest integer $n$ such that $P(n)1000$:\n$$\n50\\,(1.12)^{5}(1.20)^{n}1000 \\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\; (1.20)^{n}\\frac{1000}{50\\,(1.12)^{5}}=\\frac{20}{(1.12)^{5}}.\n$$\nTaking natural logarithms,\n$$\nn\\,\\ln(1.20)\\ln(20)-5\\ln(1.12),\n$$\nso\n$$\nn\\frac{\\ln(20)-5\\ln(1.12)}{\\ln(1.20)}.\n$$\nNumerically,\n$$\n\\frac{\\ln(20)-5\\ln(1.12)}{\\ln(1.20)}\\approx 13.33,\n$$\nand since $n$ must be an integer and the inequality is strict, the minimum is $n=14$.
