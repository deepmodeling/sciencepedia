The study focuses on the female population, which is categorized into three distinct age classes based on an annual census: Juveniles (first-year birds), Subadults (second-year birds), and Adults (third-year birds). The life cycle is modeled such that all birds die after their third year.\n\nBased on several years of field data, the researchers have determined the following average annual vital rates for the female population:\n- Juveniles do not reproduce.\n- Each subadult female produces 0.8 new female juveniles that survive to be counted in the next census.\n- Each adult female produces 1.5 new female juveniles that survive to be counted in the next census.\n- The probability of a juvenile surviving one year to become a subadult is 0.3.\n- The probability of a subadult surviving one year to become an adult is 0.6.\n\nAt the beginning of the study (year $t=0$), the census records a population of 200 juvenile females, 100 subadult females, and 50 adult females.

[@problem_id:1859251]", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the population dynamics of a species of sessile marine invertebrate. The population is categorized into three distinct life stages: Stage 1 (Recruit), Stage 2 (Juvenile), and Stage 3 (Adult). The population vector at time $t$ is given by $n(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} n_1(t) \\\\ n_2(t) \\\\ n_3(t) \\end{pmatrix}$, where $n_i(t)$ is the number of individuals in stage $i$. The population projection from one year to the next is described by the matrix equation $n(t+1) = A n(t)$, where the projection matrix $A$ is given by:\n\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 2.5 \\\\\n0.3 & 0.4 & 0.1 \\\\\n0 & 0.5 & 0.8\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe ecologist needs to classify this matrix based on standard population modeling theory. The two primary types of projection matrices are defined as follows:\n\n*   **Leslie Matrix**: A model for age-structured populations where individuals can only survive and advance to the next older age class (progression). Individuals cannot skip age classes or revert to a younger age class (retrogression). Fecundity values are located in the first row, and probabilities of survival and advancing to the next age class are on the sub-diagonal.\n\n*   **Lefkovitch Matrix**: A more general model for stage-structured populations (e.g., based on size, developmental stage, or condition). It allows for individuals to remain in the same stage (stasis), advance to a later stage (progression), or even regress to an earlier stage (retrogression).\n\nBased on the structure of the matrix $A$ and the provided definitions, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The matrix is a Leslie matrix because individuals can only progress to the next stage or remain in their current stage.\n\nB. The matrix is a Lefkovitch matrix because it represents an age-structured population model.\n\nC. The matrix is a Lefkovitch matrix because it allows for an individual to regress from a later stage (Adult) to an earlier stage (Juvenile).\n\nD. The matrix is a Leslie matrix because only the oldest stage class (Adult) contributes to reproduction.", "solution": "We consider the projection equation $n(t+1)=A\\,n(t)$ with\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 2.5\\\\\n0.3 & 0.4 & 0.1\\\\\n0 & 0.5 & 0.8\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nBy convention, the entry $a_{ij}$ gives the expected contribution from stage $j$ at time $t$ to stage $i$ at time $t+1$, including reproduction when $i=1$. \n\nFirst, identify the fecundity structure: the first row has $a_{13}=2.5$ and $a_{11}=a_{12}=0$, so only Stage 3 (Adult) contributes offspring to Stage 1 (Recruit). This placement of fecundities in the first row is consistent with both Leslie and Lefkovitch forms, so it does not by itself distinguish the matrix type.\n\nNext, check for stasis and progression. The subdiagonal entries $a_{21}=0.3$ and $a_{32}=0.5$ represent progression from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and from Stage 2 to Stage 3, respectively. The diagonal entries $a_{22}=0.4$ and $a_{33}=0.8$ represent stasis in Stage 2 and Stage 3, respectively.\n\nCrucially, check for retrogression: $a_{23}=0.1$ represents transitions from Stage 3 (Adult) at time $t$ to Stage 2 (Juvenile) at time $t+1$, i.e., regression to a younger stage. In standard population modeling theory:\n- A Leslie matrix (age-structured) permits only survival to the next age class (subdiagonal) and does not allow remaining in the same age class (since age always increases by one per time step) nor regressing to a younger class.\n- A Lefkovitch matrix (stage-structured) allows stasis (diagonal), progression (subdiagonal or possibly beyond), and retrogression (entries above the subdiagonal), reflecting transitions among stages that are not strictly tied to chronological age.\n\nBecause $A$ contains retrogression ($a_{23}>0$) and stasis ($a_{22}>0$, $a_{33}>0$), it cannot be a Leslie matrix and fits the definition of a Lefkovitch matrix.
