The new total number of patches, $H'_{total}$, is:\n$$ H'_{total} = 0.25 \\times H_{total} = \\frac{1}{4} H_{total} $$\nThe problem explicitly states a key assumption: \"the parameter $c$ is directly proportional to the total number of available habitat patches.\" Let this proportionality be represented by $c = k H_{total}$, where $k$ is some constant.
