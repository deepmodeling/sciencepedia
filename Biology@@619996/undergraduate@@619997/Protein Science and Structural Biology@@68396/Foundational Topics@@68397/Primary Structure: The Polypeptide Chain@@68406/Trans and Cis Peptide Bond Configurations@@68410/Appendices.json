The peptide bond preceding a proline residue is the most significant exception, where the *cis* conformation becomes energetically accessible due to proline's unique cyclic structure. This practice challenges you to think like a structural biologist, analyzing the specific steric interactions that make the energetic penalty for a *cis* X-Pro bond much lower than for other peptide bonds. [@problem_id:2149132]", "problem": "In protein structures, the peptide bond connecting two amino acids almost always adopts a *trans* configuration. This is because the *cis* configuration leads to a severe steric clash between the side chains (R-groups) of the adjacent amino acids. A notable exception is the peptide bond preceding a proline residue (an X-Pro bond), where the *cis* form, while less common than *trans*, is observed with a non-negligible frequency of about 5-10%. The relative stability of the *cis* and *trans* forms for an X-Pro bond depends on the identity of the preceding residue, X. Experimental data shows that when X is Glycine (Gly), the *cis* configuration is significantly more frequent than when X is Phenylalanine (Phe).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best explanation for why a *cis* Gly-Pro peptide bond is more favorable than a *cis* Phe-Pro peptide bond?\n\nA. In the *cis* conformation, the side chain of residue X clashes with the C-delta atom of the proline ring. This clash is minimal for Glycine's small hydrogen side chain but severe for Phenylalanine's bulky benzyl group.\n\nB. The intrinsic electronic properties of the *cis* peptide bond are destabilized by the aromatic ring of Phenylalanine, an effect not present with Glycine's aliphatic side chain.\n\nC. In both *cis* and *trans* conformations, the primary steric clash for an X-Pro bond is between the side chain of residue X and the C-alpha atom of Proline. The larger Phenylalanine side chain simply makes this clash worse in all cases.\n\nD. The benzyl group of Phenylalanine forms a stabilizing pi-stacking interaction with the proline ring in the *trans* form, which strongly disfavors the formation of the *cis* isomer. This interaction is absent for Glycine.\n\nE. The primary steric hindrance in the *cis* configuration is between the side chain of residue X and the alpha-carboxyl group of the Proline residue. The planarity of the Phenylalanine ring enhances this unfavorable interaction compared to Glycine.", "solution": "The problem asks for the structural basis behind the observation that *cis* Gly-Pro peptide bonds are more common than *cis* Phe-Pro peptide bonds. We must analyze the steric interactions in the *cis* and *trans* conformations of an X-Pro peptide bond.\n\nStep 1: Understand the unique geometry of the X-Pro peptide bond.\nUnlike other amino acids, Proline's side chain is a five-membered ring that connects its C-alpha atom back to its own backbone nitrogen atom. This cyclic structure has a profound impact on the energetics of the preceding peptide bond (the X-Pro bond). For a generic X-Y peptide bond, the *trans* form is heavily favored because it places the bulky side chains ($R_X$ and $R_Y$) on opposite sides of the peptide bond. In the *cis* form, they are on the same side, causing a significant steric clash. For an X-Pro bond, however, the Proline side chain is linked to the backbone nitrogen. This means that even in the *trans* configuration, there is a steric interaction between the side chain of residue X ($R_X$) and a part of the Proline residue.\n\nStep 2: Identify the specific atoms involved in steric clashes for *trans* and *cis* X-Pro bonds.\nLet's denote the preceding residue as $X_i$ and the Proline as $Pro_{i+1}$.\n- In the *trans* conformation of the $X_i-Pro_{i+1}$ peptide bond, the C-alpha of residue $X_i$ and the C-alpha of Proline ($C\\alpha_{i+1}$) are on opposite sides of the bond. However, the side chain of residue $X_i$ ($R_i$) is on the same side as Proline's C-delta ($C\\delta_{i+1}$) atom, and the side chain of Proline is on the same side as $X_i$'s C-alpha atom. The main clash is between the $R_i$ group and the $C\\alpha_{i+1}$ hydrogen.\n- In the *cis* conformation, the C-alpha atoms of $X_i$ and $Pro_{i+1}$ are on the same side of the peptide bond. This brings the side chain of residue $X_i$ ($R_i$) into close proximity with the C-delta ($C\\delta_{i+1}$) atom of the Proline ring. This is the dominant steric clash in the *cis* form.\n\nThe key is that for any amino acid X (other than Glycine), there is a side chain bulkier than a hydrogen atom. In both *cis* and *trans* forms, this side chain will clash with part of the Proline residue. The energy difference between *cis* and *trans* is therefore much smaller for X-Pro bonds than for non-proline bonds, making the *cis* form more accessible.\n\nStep 3: Compare the steric clashes for Gly-Pro and Phe-Pro.\nNow we apply this understanding to the specific cases of Glycine and Phenylalanine.\n- **Case 1: X = Glycine (Gly).** The side chain of Glycine is a single hydrogen atom (H).\n    - In the *cis* Gly-Pro conformation, the clash is between Glycine's hydrogen side chain and Proline's C-delta ($C\\delta$). This is a very small steric clash.\n    - In the *trans* Gly-Pro conformation, the clash is between Glycine's hydrogen side chain and Proline's C-alpha ($C\\alpha$) hydrogen. This is also a very small steric clash.\n    - Since the steric repulsion is minimal in both conformations, the energy difference between *cis* and *trans* Gly-Pro is very small, allowing the *cis* form to be populated significantly.\n\n- **Case 2: X = Phenylalanine (Phe).** The side chain of Phenylalanine is a large, bulky benzyl group (—$\\text{CH}_2$—Ph).\n    - In the *cis* Phe-Pro conformation, the bulky benzyl group comes into very close contact with the Proline C-delta ($C\\delta$) atom and its attached hydrogens. This creates a severe steric clash, making this conformation energetically very unfavorable.\n    - In the *trans* Phe-Pro conformation, the benzyl group clashes with the C-alpha ($C\\alpha$) hydrogen of Proline. While this is a clash, it is significantly less severe than the clash with the C-delta atom in the *cis* form.\n    - Because the steric penalty for the *cis* form is much greater than for the *trans* form, the *trans* Phe-Pro bond is strongly favored, and the *cis* form is observed much less frequently than *cis* Gly-Pro.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. This statement accurately describes the situation. The clash in the *cis* form is between the side chain of X and the C-delta of Proline. The difference in size between Glycine's H-atom and Phenylalanine's benzyl group directly explains the difference in favorability. This is the correct explanation.\n- B. While electronic effects can play a role in peptide bond stability, the primary determinant for *cis*/*trans* isomerism is steric hindrance. This is not the principal reason.\n- C. This statement incorrectly identifies the C-alpha of Proline as the source of the primary clash in *both* conformations. The major clash in the *cis* form is with the C-delta atom of the ring.\n- D. Pi-stacking between Phenylalanine and the Proline ring is not the dominant interaction that stabilizes the *trans* form. The effect is primarily driven by avoiding the severe repulsive steric clash in the *cis* form.\n- E. The clash is not with the alpha-carboxyl group of Proline, but with atoms on the Proline ring itself, specifically the C-delta in the *cis* case.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is the differential steric clash between the side chain of the preceding residue and the C-delta atom of the Proline ring in the `cis` conformation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2149132"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we bridge the gap from structure to function by examining how this conformational feature impacts biological activity.
