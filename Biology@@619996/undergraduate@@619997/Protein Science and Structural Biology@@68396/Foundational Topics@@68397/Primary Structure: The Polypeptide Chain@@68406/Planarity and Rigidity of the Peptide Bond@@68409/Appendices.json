This practice invites you to quantify this constraint through a thought experiment that compares a natural peptide to a hypothetical analog with a fully flexible backbone [@problem_id:2123779]. By calculating the difference in rotational degrees of freedom, you will gain a concrete appreciation for why the planar peptide bond is essential for narrowing the search space during protein folding.", "problem": "The backbone of a polypeptide chain consists of a repeating sequence of atoms: the amide nitrogen (N), the alpha-carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$), and the carbonyl carbon (C'). The conformational flexibility of this chain, which is critical for protein folding, is determined by rotations around the bonds within this backbone. In a naturally occurring polypeptide, the peptide bond connecting the C' of residue `i` to the N of residue `i+1` exhibits significant partial double-bond character due to electron resonance. This property confers rigidity and planarity to the peptide group, severely restricting rotation around this C'-N bond.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical thought experiment. A bioengineer creates a novel polypeptide analog where the peptide bond has been chemically altered to be a pure, freely rotating single bond, completely eliminating the partial double-bond character.

Mastering this concept is fundamental to understanding the formation of $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, the building blocks of protein architecture.", "problem": "In the study of protein architecture, understanding the nature of the peptide bond is fundamental. The peptide bond, which links amino acids together to form a polypeptide chain, has a unique electronic structure. Due to resonance, the C-N bond has approximately 40% double-bond character, which makes the peptide group (defined by the atoms C', O, N, and H, where C' is the carbonyl carbon) planar and rigid. This structural feature is crucial for the formation of stable secondary structures like $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between different peptide groups along the polypeptide backbone.\n\nConsider a single, isolated \"peptide bond group\" consisting of a carbonyl carbon (C'), a carbonyl oxygen (O), an amide nitrogen (N), and the amide hydrogen (H) to which the nitrogen is covalently bonded.

Applying the donor/acceptor criteria to each atom:\n\nA. Carbonyl oxygen (O) as hydrogen bond donor: False. The carbonyl oxygen in $C'=O$ is not bonded to hydrogen, so there is no $O\\!-\\!H$ bond to donate. Although $O$ is electronegative, donor behavior requires an attached hydrogen, which is absent here.\n\nB. Amide hydrogen (H) as hydrogen bond acceptor: False. Hydrogen has no lone pairs; only atoms with available lone pairs can act as acceptors.\n\nC. Amide nitrogen (N) as hydrogen bond acceptor: False. In an amide, the nitrogen lone pair is delocalized into the carbonyl via resonance, residing in a $p$ orbital contributing to the partial $\\pi$ bond. This resonance substantially reduces the basicity and lone-pair availability, so the amide nitrogen does not act as a hydrogen bond acceptor in proteins.\n\nD. Carbonyl oxygen (O) as hydrogen bond acceptor: True. The carbonyl oxygen is highly electronegative and bears lone pairs with partial negative character $\\delta^{-}$, making it a good acceptor. This is the canonical acceptor in peptide hydrogen bonding.\n\nE. Amide hydrogen (H) as hydrogen bond donor: True. The $N\\!-\\!H$ bond is polarized with $H$ bearing $\\delta^{+}$ due to the electronegativity of nitrogen, so the amide $N\\!-\\!H$ group donates hydrogen bonds to acceptors such as carbonyl oxygens.\n\nF.
