A pentapeptide is a short protein chain composed of five amino acids linked together. The available building blocks for this synthesis are two identical molecules of Serine (S), one molecule of Proline (P), one molecule of Tryptophan (W), and one molecule of Aspartic acid (D). Through experimental analysis, it has been determined that any sequence where Proline is immediately followed by Tryptophan (i.e., the subsequence 'PW') results in a configuration that is sterically unstable and thus does not form. Calculate the total number of unique, stable pentapeptide sequences that can be synthesized from these building blocks.", "solution": "We consider sequences formed from the multiset $\\{S,S,P,W,D\\}$. Since the two serines are identical, the total number of distinct permutations without any constraints is the number of permutations of a multiset:\n$$\n\\frac{5!}{2!}.\n$$\nNext, we count the forbidden sequences in which $P$ is immediately followed by $W$ (the consecutive subsequence $PW$).

This property is fundamental to a protein's function and is exploited in common laboratory techniques like ion-exchange chromatography.

The principle of this technique relies on the net charge of the peptide at a specific pH. For the peptide to bind to the positively charged resin of the anion-exchange column, it must have a net negative charge.\n\nThe primary structure of the synthetic pentapeptide is given by the sequence:\nArg-His-Asp-Glu-Lys\n\nThe separation is to be conducted in a buffer solution with a pH of 11.0. To predict the behavior of the peptide, calculate its approximate net electrical charge at this pH.\n\nFor your calculation, use the following typical pKa values for the ionizable groups in the peptide:\n\n| Ionizable Group             | pKa   |\n|-----------------------------|-------|\n| Terminal α-amino group      | 9.6   |\n| Terminal α-carboxyl group   | 2.2   |\n| Side chain of Arginine (Arg)| 12.5  |\n| Side chain of Histidine (His)| 6.0   |\n| Side chain of Aspartic Acid (Asp)| 3.9   |\n| Side chain of Glutamic Acid (Glu)| 4.3   |\n| Side chain of Lysine (Lys)  | 10.5  |", "solution": "To determine the net charge of the pentapeptide Arg-His-Asp-Glu-Lys at pH 11.0, we must evaluate the protonation state of each ionizable group. The general rule is: if the pH is above the pKa, the group will be predominantly deprotonated; if the pH is below the pKa, the group will be predominantly protonated. We will sum the charges of all individual ionizable groups to find the net charge.\n\nThe peptide has seven ionizable groups: the N-terminal α-amino group, the C-terminal α-carboxyl group, and the side chains (R-groups) of the five amino acids. However, only the side chains of Arginine, Histidine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamic Acid, and Lysine are ionizable.\n\nLet's analyze each group at pH 11.0:\n\n1.  **N-terminal α-amino group (on Arginine):** The pKa of this group is 9.6. Since the pH (11.0) is greater than the pKa (9.6), the group will be deprotonated. The protonated form is $-NH_3^+$ (charge +1), and the deprotonated form is $-NH_2$ (charge 0). Thus, the charge on the N-terminus is 0.\n\n2.  **Side chain of Arginine (Arg):** The side chain (a guanidinium group) has a pKa of 12.5. Since the pH (11.0) is less than the pKa (12.5), the group will be protonated. The protonated form has a charge of +1.\n\n3.  **Side chain of Histidine (His):** The side chain (an imidazole ring) has a pKa of 6.0. Since the pH (11.0) is greater than the pKa (6.0), the group will be deprotonated. The protonated form has a charge of +1, and the deprotonated form is neutral (charge 0). Thus, the charge on the His side chain is 0.\n\n4.  **Side chain of Aspartic Acid (Asp):** The side chain (a carboxyl group) has a pKa of 3.9. Since the pH (11.0) is greater than the pKa (3.9), the group will be deprotonated. The protonated form, $-COOH$, is neutral (charge 0), and the deprotonated form, $-COO^-$, has a charge of -1. Thus, the charge on the Asp side chain is -1.\n\n5.  **Side chain of Glutamic Acid (Glu):** The side chain (a carboxyl group) has a pKa of 4.3. Since the pH (11.0) is greater than the pKa (4.3), this group will also be deprotonated. The deprotonated form, $-COO^-$, has a charge of -1.\n\n6.  **Side chain of Lysine (Lys):** The side chain (an amino group) has a pKa of 10.5. Since the pH (11.0) is greater than the pKa (10.5), this group will be deprotonated. The protonated form, $-NH_3^+$, has a charge of +1, and the deprotonated form, $-NH_2$, is neutral (charge 0). Thus, the charge on the Lys side chain is 0.\n\n7.  **C-terminal α-carboxyl group (on Lysine):** The pKa of this group is 2.2. Since the pH (11.0) is much greater than the pKa (2.2), this group will be deprotonated. The deprotonated form, $-COO^-$, has a charge of -1.\n\nNow, we sum the charges of all the groups to find the net charge of the pentapeptide:\n\nNet Charge = (N-terminus) + (Arg side chain) + (His side chain) + (Asp side chain) + (Glu side chain) + (Lys side chain) + (C-terminus)\nNet Charge = (0) + (+1) + (0) + (-1) + (-1) + (0) + (-1)\nNet Charge = $1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = -2$\n\nTherefore, the approximate net charge of the pentapeptide at pH 11.0 is -2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2}$$", "id": "2331504"}, {"introduction": "Determining the primary structure of a novel protein is a classic biochemical puzzle. One powerful method involves using enzymes, like trypsin and chymotrypsin, that act as molecular scissors, cutting the polypeptide chain at specific amino acid residues.

To determine its amino acid sequence, two separate enzymatic digestion experiments are performed on identical samples of the purified peptide.\n\nIn the first experiment, a sample of Neurostimulin is treated with the endopeptidase trypsin. Trypsin specifically hydrolyzes peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of lysine (Lys, K) and arginine (Arg, R) residues. This digestion yields the following three fragments, whose individual sequences were subsequently determined:\n- Fragment T1: `Ala-Trp-Leu-Pro`\n- Fragment T2: `Ser-Val-Phe-Ile-Arg`\n- Fragment T3: `Met-Gly-Lys`\n\nIn the second experiment, a new sample of Neurostimulin is treated with the endopeptidase chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin is known to hydrolyze peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of large aromatic amino acids, specifically phenylalanine (Phe, F), tryptophan (Trp, W), and tyrosine (Tyr, Y). This treatment yields the following three fragments:\n- Fragment C1: `Ile-Arg-Ala-Trp`\n- Fragment C2: `Leu-Pro`\n- Fragment C3: `Met-Gly-Lys-Ser-Val-Phe`\n\nBased on the fragments obtained from these two enzymatic digests, determine the complete and correct amino acid sequence of the original Neurostimulin peptide.

The given tryptic fragments are:\n- T1: Ala-Trp-Leu-Pro (A-W-L-P), which does not end in K or R, so T1 must be the C-terminal fragment.\n- T2: Ser-Val-Phe-Ile-Arg (S-V-F-I-R), which ends in R, consistent with an internal tryptic fragment.\n- T3: Met-Gly-Lys (M-G-K), which ends in K, consistent with an internal tryptic fragment.\n\nThus, the order imposed by trypsin is that an N-terminal fragment must end in K (T3), followed by a fragment that ends in R (T2), followed by the C-terminal fragment (T1). This yields the assembled sequence:\nM-G-K-S-V-F-I-R-A-W-L-P.\n\nNext, verify this sequence with chymotrypsin, which cleaves on the C-terminal side of aromatic residues phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), and tyrosine (Y). In the sequence M-G-K-S-V-F-I-R-A-W-L-P, the aromatic residues are F and W. Cleaving after F and W yields:\n- From the N-terminus to F: M-G-K-S-V-F, matching C3.\n- From after F to W: I-R-A-W, matching C1.\n- From after W to the C-terminus: L-P, matching C2.\n\nSince both the trypsin and chymotrypsin fragment sets are perfectly consistent with M-G-K-S-V-F-I-R-A-W-L-P, the correct choice is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2064544"}]}
