The genetic code, which translates nucleotide codons into amino acids, exhibits redundancy, a property known as degeneracy.

Their strategy is to introduce a negative charge at a key position on the enzyme's surface, which is currently occupied by a polar, uncharged amino acid.

We must evaluate each option against this requirement.\n\nThe process for each option is as follows:\n1.  Identify the amino acid corresponding to the initial codon and verify it is in the \"Polar, Uncharged\" category.\n2.  Identify the amino acid (or stop signal) corresponding to the final codon.\n3.  Verify that the final amino acid is in the \"Negatively Charged\" category.\n4.  Confirm that the change from the initial codon to the final codon is a single-base substitution.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. `ACA` to `CCA`**\n1.  The initial codon is `ACA`. According to the provided list, `ACA` codes for Threonine (Thr). Threonine is a polar, uncharged amino acid, so this is a valid starting point.\n2.  The final codon is `CCA`. This codon codes for Proline (Pro).\n3.  Proline is classified as a nonpolar, aliphatic amino acid, not a negatively charged one.\n4.  Therefore, this mutation does not produce the desired change in amino acid property. Option A is incorrect.\n\n**B. `UGU` to `UGA`**\n1.  The initial codon is `UGU`. This codon codes for Cysteine (Cys). Cysteine is a polar, uncharged amino acid, so this is a valid starting point.\n2.  The final codon is `UGA`. This is a stop codon.\n3.  A stop codon terminates protein synthesis, it does not code for a negatively charged amino acid. This type of mutation is called a nonsense mutation.\n4.  Therefore, this mutation does not produce the desired amino acid substitution. Option B is incorrect.\n\n**C. `CAG` to `AAG`**\n1.  The initial codon is `CAG`. This codon codes for Glutamine (Gln). Glutamine is a polar, uncharged amino acid, a valid starting point.\n2.  The final codon is `AAG`. This codon codes for Lysine (Lys).\n3.  Lysine is classified as a positively charged amino acid, not a negatively charged one.\n4.  Therefore, this mutation results in the opposite of the desired charge effect. Option C is incorrect.\n\n**D. `UAC` to `GAC`**\n1.  The initial codon is `UAC`. This codon codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). Tyrosine is a polar, uncharged amino acid, a valid starting point.\n2.  The final codon is `GAC`. This codon codes for Aspartic acid (Asp).\n3.  Aspartic acid is a negatively charged amino acid. This matches the desired outcome.\n4.  The mutation is from `UAC` to `GAC`. This involves a single-base change at the first position (`U` is replaced by `G`). This matches the single-base mutation requirement.\n5.  Since all conditions are met, this is a possible correct answer.\n\n**E. `AGU` to `GAC`**\n1.  The initial codon is `AGU`. This codon codes for Serine (Ser). Serine is a polar, uncharged amino acid, a valid starting point.\n2.  The final codon is `GAC`. This codon codes for Aspartic acid (Asp).\n3.  Aspartic acid is a negatively charged amino acid. This matches the desired amino acid property change.\n4.  Let's examine the mutation: `AGU` to `GAC`. The first base changes from `A` to `G`. The third base changes from `U` to `C`. This transformation requires two base substitutions.\n5.  The problem explicitly states the mutation must be a single-base change.

Unlike point mutations that may only change a single amino acid, the insertion or deletion of a nucleotide can disrupt the entire reading frame, leading to catastrophic changes in the resulting protein. This thought experiment guides you through a comparison of two different frameshift mutations, highlighting how the *location* of a mutation is just as critical as its type and revealing a common mechanism behind genetic diseases [@problem_id:2142510].", "problem": "In a molecular biology lab, you are studying a hypothetical gene that codes for an enzyme called \"aromatase-Z,\" which is crucial for the breakdown of a synthetic pollutant. The functional, wild-type version of the aromatase-Z protein is composed of exactly 150 amino acids. The messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) transcribed from this gene has a coding sequence that begins with the start codon AUG and terminates with a stop codon.\n\nA research assistant prepares two separate mutant strains of the organism. Each strain has a single, distinct mutation in the aromatase-Z gene:\n\n*   **Mutation A:** A single guanine (G) nucleotide is inserted into the mRNA sequence immediately following the three nucleotides of the start codon.\n*   **Mutation B:** A single adenine (A) nucleotide is deleted from the codon that is immediately upstream of the original stop codon.\n\nAssuming that both mutant mRNA transcripts are stable and successfully recruited by the ribosome for translation, which of the following statements most accurately compares the protein products resulting from Mutation A and Mutation B?\n\nA. Both Mutation A and Mutation B will produce proteins that are 150 amino acids long, but with a single incorrect amino acid at the site of the mutation.\n\nB. Mutation A will produce a protein with a single incorrect amino acid at the second position, while Mutation B will result in a protein that is truncated by one amino acid at its end.\n\nC. Both mutations will cause a frameshift, resulting in completely altered and non-functional proteins of a length that is unpredictable but likely similar to each other.\n\nD. Mutation A will result in a protein with an amino acid sequence that is altered from the second amino acid onwards, likely leading to premature termination and a severely truncated, non-functional protein. Mutation B will result in a protein that is identical to the wild-type for most of its length, with changes only affecting the very end of the amino acid sequence.\n\nE. Mutation B is more severe than Mutation A because altering the C-terminus of a protein is always more disruptive to its function than altering the N-terminus.", "solution": "Principles: Translation initiates at the first start codon AUG and proceeds in non-overlapping triplets (codons) until a stop codon is encountered. Insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by $3$ causes a frameshift, altering all downstream codons. Frameshifts commonly introduce premature termination codons because there are $3$ stop codons among $64$ possible codons, so out-of-frame translation frequently encounters a stop after a relatively short distance.\n\nWild-type gene: The functional aromatase-Z protein has length $150$ amino acids, so the coding region contains $150$ sense codons. The reading frame is established by the AUG at the start and continues unchanged until the in-frame stop codon that terminates translation.\n\nMutation A (single-nucleotide insertion immediately after AUG): Let the AUG occupy positions $1$–$3$ of the mRNA. Inserting one guanine at position $4$ shifts the reading frame by $+1$ starting at the second codon. Consequences:\n- The first amino acid (methionine) from AUG is unchanged.\n- Every codon from the second codon onward is altered relative to wild-type because the grouping of nucleotides into triplets is shifted.\n- The new frame is highly likely to contain an in-frame stop codon relatively soon, causing premature termination. Therefore, the resulting protein is expected to be severely truncated and non-functional, with its amino acid sequence altered from the second residue onward.\n\nMutation B (single-nucleotide deletion from the codon immediately upstream of the original stop): The codon immediately upstream of the original stop encodes the C-terminal residue of the wild-type protein. Deleting one adenine from this codon causes a frameshift beginning at this last sense codon and abolishes the original in-frame stop codon by shifting it out of frame. Consequences:\n- The amino acid sequence is identical to wild-type up to the point of deletion, i.e., through essentially the entire length of the protein except its very end.\n- The last residue encoded by the mutated codon will change, and because the original stop is out of frame, translation continues in the new frame until the next stop codon is encountered downstream. Thus, only the C-terminus is altered (it may be extended or shortened depending on where the new stop occurs), while most of the protein remains unchanged.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because both mutations are frameshifts, not single-codon missense changes yielding $150$ amino acids.\n- B is incorrect because Mutation A does not produce only a single incorrect amino acid; it alters the frame from the second codon onward and typically truncates early. Mutation B does not necessarily truncate by exactly one amino acid; the length becomes unpredictable due to the frameshift at the end.\n- C is incorrect because although both are frameshifts, Mutation B leaves most of the protein identical to wild-type and only alters the C-terminus; it is not “completely altered” nor necessarily similar in length to the product of Mutation A.\n- D correctly states that Mutation A alters the sequence from the second amino acid onward and likely causes premature termination with a severely truncated, non-functional protein, while Mutation B leaves the protein identical to wild-type for most of its length with changes confined to the very end of the sequence.\n- E is incorrect because the blanket statement that C-terminal changes are always more disruptive than N-terminal changes is false.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate comparison is given by option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2142510"}]}
