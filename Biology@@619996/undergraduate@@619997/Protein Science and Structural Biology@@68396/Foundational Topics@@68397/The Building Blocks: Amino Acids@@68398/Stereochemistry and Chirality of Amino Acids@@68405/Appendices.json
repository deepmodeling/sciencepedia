In biological systems, this three-dimensional structure is crucial for function. A primary source of stereoisomerism in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four distinct chemical groups.\n\nThe amino acid isoleucine, a fundamental component of proteins, is notable for having two such chiral centers. One is the alpha-carbon, which is chiral in all standard amino acids except glycine. The other is the beta-carbon, located within its side chain.

For a molecule with $n$ independent chiral centers and no internal plane of symmetry that would make any stereoisomer identical to its mirror image (i.e., no meso forms), the maximum number of stereoisomers is given by the combinatorial rule for independent binary choices:\n$$\nN = 2^n.\n$$\nIsoleucine has two chiral centers (the $\\alpha$-carbon and the $\\beta$-carbon), so $n=2$.

Fischer projections provide a standardized convention for this purpose, which is essential for unambiguous communication in chemistry and biology. This practice [@problem_id:2139377] asks you to delve into the specifics of this notation by identifying the correct Fischer projection for L-threonine, an amino acid with two distinct chiral centers. This is a practical skill for visualizing and distinguishing between closely related stereoisomers like diastereomers and enantiomers.", "problem": "In the study of protein structure, understanding the precise stereochemistry of the constituent amino acids is fundamental. The 20 common proteinogenic amino acids are, with the exception of glycine, chiral molecules. For amino acids with a single chiral center, this chirality is defined by an L- or D- configuration. Threonine, however, is one of two proteinogenic amino acids that possess two chiral centers, giving rise to four possible stereoisomers. In all known biological systems, only one of these stereoisomers, L-threonine, is incorporated into proteins.\n\nYou are tasked with identifying the correct structure of L-threonine from a set of descriptions. Each description corresponds to a Fischer projection, following the standard convention where the carbon backbone is represented vertically with the most oxidized carbon (the carboxyl group, -COOH) at the top. The chain is numbered C1 (carboxyl), C2 (alpha-carbon), C3 (beta-carbon), and C4 (methyl carbon). For each chiral carbon (C2 and C3), the descriptions specify the groups attached to the left and right.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the Fischer projection of the naturally occurring L-threonine?\n\nA. For the alpha-carbon (C2), the amino group (-NH2) is on the left and a hydrogen atom (-H) is on the right. For the beta-carbon (C3), the hydroxyl group (-OH) is on the left and a hydrogen atom (-H) is on the right.\n\nB. For the alpha-carbon (C2), the amino group (-NH2) is on the right and a hydrogen atom (-H) is on the left. For the beta-carbon (C3), the hydroxyl group (-OH) is on the left and a hydrogen atom (-H) is on the right.\n\nC. For the alpha-carbon (C2), the amino group (-NH2) is on the left and a hydrogen atom (-H) is on the right. For the beta-carbon (C3), a hydrogen atom (-H) is on the left and the hydroxyl group (-OH) is on the right.\n\nD. For the alpha-carbon (C2), the amino group (-NH2) is on the right and a hydrogen atom (-H) is on the left. For the beta-carbon (C3), a hydrogen atom (-H) is on the left and the hydroxyl group (-OH) is on the right.", "solution": "We first fix the Fischer projection conventions for amino acids: place the most oxidized carbon (the carboxyl carbon, C1) at the top and the carbon chain vertically downward. In a Fischer projection, horizontal substituents project toward the observer and vertical substituents project away from the observer.\n\nBy definition of the L series for amino acids, when the carboxyl group is at the top and the side chain is at the bottom, the amino group at the alpha-carbon (C2) is on the left and the hydrogen at C2 is on the right. Therefore, at C2 the correct arrangement is $-\\text{NH}_2$ on the left and $-\\text{H}$ on the right. This immediately eliminates any option that places $-\\text{NH}_2$ on the right at C2. Hence only options A and C satisfy the L configuration at C2.\n\nNext, we determine the correct configuration at the beta-carbon (C3) for L-threonine. The substituents at C3 are:\n- $-\\text{OH}$,\n- the substituent going up to C2 (which leads to $-\\text{NH}_2$ and $-\\text{COOH}$),\n- the substituent going down to C4 (a methyl group $-\\text{CH}_3$),\n- $-\\text{H}$.\n\nBy the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog (CIP) rules, the priorities at C3 are:\n$$1 = -\\text{OH}, \\quad 2 = \\text{the carbon leading to C2}, \\quad 3 = -\\text{CH}_3, \\quad 4 = -\\text{H}.$$\nWe now compare the two candidate Fischer layouts at C3:\n- Option A: $-\\text{OH}$ left, $-\\text{H}$ right (with C2 up, $-\\text{CH}_3$ down).\n- Option C: $-\\text{H}$ left, $-\\text{OH}$ right (with C2 up, $-\\text{CH}_3$ down).\n\nIn a Fischer projection, horizontal substituents are coming out (front), and vertical substituents go back. For option C at C3, assign vectors for the substituents relative to the stereocenter as follows:\n- Right: $-\\text{OH}$ corresponds to $\\mathbf{v}_{1} = (1,0,1)$,\n- Up: path to C2 corresponds to $\\mathbf{v}_{2} = (0,1,-1)$,\n- Down: $-\\text{CH}_3$ corresponds to $\\mathbf{v}_{3} = (0,-1,-1)$,\n- Left: $-\\text{H}$ corresponds to $\\mathbf{v}_{4} = (-1,0,1)$.\n\nUsing the scalar triple product to determine handedness for the ordered set $(1,2,3)$,\n$$\\det\\big[\\mathbf{v}_{1}, \\mathbf{v}_{2}, \\mathbf{v}_{3}\\big] = \\det\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} = -2.$$\nA negative value indicates a left-handed sense for $(1 \\to 2 \\to 3)$ in this viewing, but because the lowest priority group (4, hydrogen) is on a horizontal position (front), the observed sense must be inverted to obtain the true stereochemical assignment. Thus option C yields an $R$ configuration at C3.\n\nIt is known that naturally occurring L-threonine has configurations $(2S,3R)$, whereas L-allo-threonine has $(2S,3S)$. Therefore, the arrangement at C3 with $-\\text{OH}$ on the right and $-\\text{H}$ on the left (option C) corresponds to $3R$ and is the naturally occurring L-threonine. By contrast, option A would place $-\\text{OH}$ left and $-\\text{H}$ right at C3, which, by the same analysis, gives $3S$ (L-allo-threonine).\n\nTherefore, the correct Fischer projection description for naturally occurring L-threonine is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2139377"}, {"introduction": "The structural differences between stereoisomers are not merely theoretical; they lead to distinct physical properties.
