This first practice challenges you to dissect a dipeptide, Trp-Phe, and identify its $sp^2$-hybridized carbon atoms [@problem_id:2099859]. Mastering this skill is crucial for visualizing the planar, rigid nature of aromatic rings and peptide bonds, which are key determinants of protein architecture.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a short peptide chain composed of two aromatic amino acids, Tryptophan followed by Phenylalanine, forming the dipeptide Trp-Phe. To understand its structural properties, the biochemist needs to determine the count of specific types of atoms within the molecule.\n\nAssuming the dipeptide exists in its predominant ionic form in a solution at pH 7.0, calculate the total number of sp²-hybridized carbon atoms present in a single molecule of Trp-Phe. Provide the total count as an integer.", "solution": "We first establish the exact structure of the dipeptide Trp-Phe with Trp at the N-terminus and Phe at the C-terminus. The peptide bond forms between the carboxyl group of Trp and the amino group of Phe, yielding an amide linkage. At pH 7.0 (predominant ionic forms), the N-terminus is protonated ($\\text{NH}_{3}^{+}$), the C-terminus is deprotonated ($\\text{COO}^{-}$), the indole nitrogen of Trp is neutral, and the phenyl ring of Phe is unaffected.\n\nThe hybridization count focuses on carbon atoms that are $sp^{2}$-hybridized. These arise from:\n- Aromatic ring carbons (each is $sp^{2}$).\n- Carbonyl carbons (amide and carboxylate carbons are $sp^{2}$ due to trigonal planar geometry and $\\pi$-bonding).\n\nWe count contributions:\n1. Tryptophan side chain (indole ring): Indole has a fused bicyclic system containing $8$ distinct carbon atoms, all $sp^{2}$. Thus, Trp contributes $8$ $sp^{2}$ carbons from the indole ring.\n2. Phenylalanine side chain (phenyl ring): The benzene ring contains $6$ carbon atoms, all $sp^{2}$. Thus, Phe contributes $6$ $sp^{2}$ carbons from the phenyl ring.\n3. Peptide/backbone carbonyls:\n   - The amide (peptide bond) carbonyl carbon derived from Trp is $sp^{2}$: contributes $1$.\n   - The C-terminal carboxylate carbon on Phe is $sp^{2}$: contributes $1$.\n\nNo other carbons in the backbone (e.g., $\\alpha$-carbons, methylene carbons) are $sp^{2}$; they are $sp^{3}$. Protonation/deprotonation at pH $7.0$ does not change the above hybridizations.\n\nTherefore, the total number of $sp^{2}$-hybridized carbon atoms is $8+6+1+1=16$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "2099859"}, {"introduction": "The aromatic side chains of tryptophan and tyrosine provide a convenient \"handle\" for biochemists to detect and quantify proteins using UV-Vis spectrophotometry.
