This exercise [@problem_id:2104870] explores how the size and shape of amino acid side chains are critical determinants of this packing efficiency. By analyzing a hypothetical mutation from the small amino acid glycine to the bulky valine, you will see how steric clashes can disrupt a protein's intricate architecture and compromise its overall stability.", "problem": "In a structural biology study of a thermostable enzyme, a single point mutation is discovered that significantly lowers the enzyme's melting temperature, indicating a loss of structural stability. The mutation involves the substitution of a glycine (Gly) residue with a valine (Val) residue. X-ray crystallography data for the original (wild-type) enzyme reveals that this specific glycine residue is located deep within the protein's core, an environment characterized by a high density of nonpolar amino acid side chains and very little empty space.\n\nBased on the properties of amino acids and the principles of protein structure, what is the most likely primary reason for the observed destabilization of the protein upon the glycine-to-valine mutation?\n\nA. The bulky, branched side chain of valine introduces significant steric clashes with neighboring residues in the tightly packed core.\nB. The valine side chain is less hydrophobic than the glycine side chain, weakening the overall hydrophobic effect that stabilizes the protein core.\nC. The mutation eliminates a critical hydrogen bond that was originally formed by the side chain of the glycine residue.\nD. Valine's side chain has a different pKa value than glycine's, introducing an unfavorable electrostatic repulsion in the neutral core.\nE. The substitution of a flexible glycine with a more rigid valine excessively restricts the protein's ability to \"breathe\" or undergo small conformational adjustments, leading to instability.", "solution": "We proceed by applying fundamental principles of protein structure and amino acid properties:\n\n1) The interior of globular proteins is typically a tightly packed, hydrophobic environment stabilized primarily by van der Waals packing and the hydrophobic effect. There is very little empty space, and side-chain complementarity is crucial for stability.\n\n2) Glycine has the smallest side chain (a single hydrogen). Its minimal steric bulk allows it to occupy sterically constrained positions and to fit into tight packing environments where larger residues would clash. It also confers high backbone conformational freedom, but in a tightly packed core, the key advantage is its tiny volume.\n\n3) Valine has a branched, bulky isopropyl side chain. Introducing valine in a deep, tightly packed core position where glycine previously resided increases steric volume substantially, especially at the $C_\\beta$ where branching occurs. In a core with very little empty space, this is highly likely to introduce steric clashes or force unfavorable local rearrangements, both of which destabilize the fold and lower the melting temperature.\n\n4) Evaluate the provided options in light of these principles:\n- Option A: The bulky, branched valine side chain causing steric clashes in a tight core is exactly the expected primary destabilizing mechanism. This matches the structural context emphasized in the prompt (deep core, high packing density, little empty space).\n- Option B: This is incorrect because valine is more hydrophobic than glycine. Replacing glycine with valine would not weaken hydrophobic stabilization; if anything, it could strengthen hydrophobic driving forces, but that benefit is outweighed by the severe steric incompatibility in this context.\n- Option C: Glycine’s side chain cannot form hydrogen bonds (it is just hydrogen). Any hydrogen bonding involving glycine would be via the backbone, and the mutation specifically changes the side chain identity; therefore, this explanation is not consistent.\n- Option D: Neither glycine nor valine has a titratable side chain under physiological conditions; there is no relevant side-chain pKa difference that would introduce electrostatic repulsion in the neutral core.\n- Option E: While glycine is indeed more flexible than valine, and a Gly-to-Val substitution restricts backbone conformations, the prompt’s emphasis on a tightly packed, deep core with minimal empty space points to steric overpacking as the dominant, primary destabilizing factor. Any change in dynamic “breathing” is secondary to steric clashes in this specific structural context.\n\nTherefore, the most likely primary reason for destabilization is the introduction of steric clashes from the bulky, branched valine side chain in a tightly packed core.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2104870"}, {"introduction": "Beyond steric bulk, the specific geometry of a side chain—its length and conformational flexibility—plays a sophisticated role in orchestrating a protein's final three-dimensional structure. This practice [@problem_id:2104909] delves into the subtle but critical differences between asparagine and glutamine. By considering their fit within a sterically constrained protein turn, you will develop an appreciation for how an optimal side-chain length is essential for forming the precise, stabilizing hydrogen bonds that define local protein architecture.", "problem": "In the folding of a protein, short polypeptide segments often form compact structures known as tight turns or loops. Consider a specific tight turn where an amino acid at position $i+2$ must use its side chain to form a stabilizing hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the residue at position $i$. The environment within this turn is sterically crowded, demanding a precise geometric arrangement for the hydrogen bond to form.\n\nYou are tasked with evaluating two candidate amino acids for the position $i+2$: asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln). Both possess an amide group in their side chain capable of acting as a hydrogen bond donor. Based on the structural properties of their side chains and the spatial constraints of a tight turn, which of the following statements provides the most accurate reasoning for which amino acid is a better fit?\n\nA. Glutamine is preferred because its longer side chain is more flexible, allowing it to more easily find a suitable orientation for hydrogen bonding.\nB. Asparagine is preferred because its shorter and more conformationally restricted side chain can satisfy the geometric constraints of forming a hydrogen bond over a short distance within a crowded turn.\nC. Glutamine is preferred because its side chain has a larger surface area, leading to more favorable van der Waals contacts that supplement the hydrogen bond.\nD. Asparagine is preferred because the nitrogen atom in its side-chain amide is a stronger hydrogen bond donor than the one in glutamine.\nE. Both asparagine and glutamine are equally suitable because their side-chain functional groups are identical, and side-chain length is irrelevant to the stability of the turn.", "solution": "We are asked to decide whether Asn or Gln at position $i+2$ is better suited to donate a side-chain hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of residue $i$ within a sterically crowded tight turn. The core physical-chemical constraints are hydrogen bond geometry (donor-acceptor distance and angle), steric crowding, and the conformational freedom and reach of the side chain.\n\nFirst, the side-chain structures: Asn has a $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CONH}_2$ side chain (one methylene before the amide), whereas Gln has a $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CONH}_2$ side chain (two methylenes before the amide). Therefore, for reaching back from $i+2$ to the $i$ carbonyl oxygen across a short spatial separation typical of a tight turn, Asn presents a shorter, more compact linkage from the backbone to the amide donor, while Gln presents a longer, more flexible linkage.\n\nSecond, hydrogen bond formation in a tight turn imposes a specific donor-acceptor distance and near-linear geometry between the donor $N-H$ vector and the acceptor oxygen lone pair direction. In a crowded environment, excess side-chain length increases the likelihood of steric clashes with backbone and neighboring side chains and requires more torsional adjustments (more rotamers) to achieve the precise geometry. This greater conformational freedom in Gln raises the entropic cost of fixing the side chain into the required orientation and often makes it harder, not easier, to satisfy the strict geometric constraints over a short distance.\n\nThird, the amide functionality in Asn and Gln is electronically equivalent with respect to hydrogen-bond donor strength; both are neutral primary amides, and the difference between them is the length/flexibility of the aliphatic linker, not the intrinsic donor capability of the amide $N-H$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: in a sterically constrained tight turn with a short required reach, additional length and flexibility are liabilities, not advantages.\n- B is correct: Asn’s shorter, more conformationally restricted side chain is better suited to achieve the precise, short-distance hydrogen bond geometry in a crowded turn.\n- C is incorrect: greater surface area from Gln does not improve fit here and can increase steric clashes; the dominant requirement is precise hydrogen bond geometry.\n- D is incorrect: the side-chain amide $N-H$ donor strength is effectively the same in Asn and Gln; the difference is not donor strength but side-chain length and conformational restraint.\n- E is incorrect: side-chain length is directly relevant to whether the amide can make the required back-bond in a tight, short-distance geometry; Asn is commonly observed in such turns (Asx turns) for this reason.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate reasoning is that Asn is preferred due to its shorter, more conformationally restricted side chain that better satisfies the geometric constraints in a crowded tight turn.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2104909"}]}
