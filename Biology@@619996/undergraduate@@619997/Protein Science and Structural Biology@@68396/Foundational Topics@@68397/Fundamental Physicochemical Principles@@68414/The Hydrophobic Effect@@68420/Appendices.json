{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The hydrophobic effect decisively guides protein folding, creating a structure where nonpolar side chains are hidden from water in a \"hydrophobic core\" while polar ones remain exposed on the surface. Understanding this principle begins with the fundamental skill of classifying amino acids by the chemical nature of their side chains. This exercise [@problem_id:2143756] challenges you to apply this logic by ranking different amino acids based on their propensity to be found in the protein's interior, a key step in predicting protein structure from sequence.", "problem": "The three-dimensional structure of a globular protein in an aqueous solution is largely dictated by the hydrophobic effect, which is the tendency of nonpolar substances to aggregate in water. This effect is a primary driving force in protein folding, causing the polypeptide chain to fold in a way that buries nonpolar amino acid side chains in the interior, forming a hydrophobic core, while exposing polar and charged side chains to the aqueous solvent on the protein's surface.\n\nConsider the following three amino acids, defined by their side chains:\n- **Phenylalanine:** Its side chain is a nonpolar benzyl group, which consists of a phenyl ring attached to a methylene group ($\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-}$).\n- **Glycine:** Its side chain is a single hydrogen atom. It is the smallest of all amino acids.\n- **Glutamic Acid:** Its side chain contains a carboxylic acid group ($\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-COOH}$). In the typical cellular environment (physiological pH), this group is deprotonated and carries a negative charge.\n\nBased on the principles of protein folding driven by the hydrophobic effect, determine the correct ranking of these three amino acids from most likely to be found in the hydrophobic core of a protein to least likely.\n\nA. Phenylalanine > Glycine > Glutamic Acid\n\nB. Glutamic Acid > Glycine > Phenylalanine\n\nC. Glycine > Phenylalanine > Glutamic Acid\n\nD. Phenylalanine > Glutamic Acid > Glycine\n\nE. Glycine > Glutamic Acid > Phenylalanine", "solution": "The governing principle is the hydrophobic effect in aqueous solution: nonpolar side chains tend to be buried in the protein interior to minimize the ordering of surrounding water and reduce the free energy of the system, while polar and especially charged side chains prefer exposure to solvent due to favorable electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions and the high desolvation penalty for burying charge.\n\nApply this to each residue:\n- Phenylalanine has a bulky, nonpolar aromatic side chain. It is strongly hydrophobic and is therefore most likely to be buried in the hydrophobic core.\n- Glycine has a side chain that is only a hydrogen atom. It is neither strongly hydrophobic nor strongly polar; it is often found on the surface or in tight turns due to its high conformational flexibility, and it lacks the hydrophobic surface area that drives burial. It is less likely than a strongly hydrophobic residue to be in the core.\n- Glutamic acid is deprotonated at physiological pH, carrying a negative charge. Charged side chains are strongly disfavored in the hydrophobic core due to desolvation costs and prefer solvent exposure.\n\nTherefore, the ranking from most likely to be in the hydrophobic core to least likely is: Phenylalanine > Glycine > Glutamic Acid, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2143756"}, {"introduction": "While a qualitative feel for amino acid properties is essential, structural biologists often use quantitative tools for more objective predictions. Hydropathy scales assign a numerical value to the hydrophobic or hydrophilic character of each amino acid, allowing for the analysis of entire protein segments. This practice [@problem_id:2143766] will guide you through using a standard hydropathy index to calculate the overall character of a peptide and predict whether it is likely to be buried or exposed to solvent.", "problem": "In structural biology, the hydrophobic effect is a primary driving force for the folding of globular proteins. It describes the tendency of nonpolar molecules or parts of molecules to aggregate in aqueous solution and exclude water molecules. To quantify this tendency for amino acid side chains, various hydropathy scales have been developed. The Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index is one such widely used scale, where a more positive value indicates a more hydrophobic (water-fearing) residue, and a more negative value indicates a more hydrophilic (water-loving) residue.\n\nAn investigator is studying a newly discovered protein and wants to predict the structural location of a specific short peptide segment within it. The sequence of this segment is:\n\nAla-Leu-Ile-Leu-Val-Trp\n\nTo make a prediction, the investigator will calculate the average hydropathy index for this entire segment. Based on this calculation, determine the most likely structural environment for this peptide segment within a folded, water-soluble globular protein. The hydropathy indices for relevant amino acids are provided below:\n\n| Amino Acid | 3-Letter Code | Hydropathy Index |\n|------------|---------------|------------------|\n| Alanine    | Ala           | 1.8              |\n| Arginine   | Arg           | -4.5             |\n| Isoleucine | Ile           | 4.5              |\n| Leucine    | Leu           | 3.8              |\n| Lysine     | Lys           | -3.9             |\n| Proline    | Pro           | -1.6             |\n| Tryptophan | Trp           | -0.9             |\n| Valine     | Val           | 4.2              |\n\nWhich of the following conclusions is the most appropriate?\n\nA. The segment has a strongly negative average hydropathy index, indicating it is highly hydrophilic and most likely exposed on the protein's surface, where it can interact with water.\n\nB. The segment has a strongly positive average hydropathy index, indicating it is highly hydrophobic and most likely buried in the protein's core, shielded from water.\n\nC. The segment has an average hydropathy index close to zero, suggesting it is neutral and has no strong preference for being on the surface or in the core.\n\nD. The segment has a mix of positive and negative index values, so it will exclusively form an amphipathic alpha-helix on the protein surface, with one face pointing towards the core and the other towards the solvent.", "solution": "We use the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index, where positive values indicate hydrophobicity and negative values indicate hydrophilicity. For the sequence Ala-Leu-Ile-Leu-Val-Trp, the indices are: Ala: $1.8$, Leu: $3.8$, Ile: $4.5$, Leu: $3.8$, Val: $4.2$, Trp: $-0.9$.\n\nCompute the average hydropathy index $H_{\\text{avg}}$ over the six residues:\n$$\nH_{\\text{avg}}=\\frac{1.8+3.8+4.5+3.8+4.2+(-0.9)}{6}.\n$$\nSum the numerator stepwise:\n$$\n1.8+3.8=5.6,\\quad 5.6+4.5=10.1,\\quad 10.1+3.8=13.9,\\quad 13.9+4.2=18.1,\\quad 18.1-0.9=17.2.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nH_{\\text{avg}}=\\frac{17.2}{6}=\\frac{172}{60}=\\frac{86}{30}=\\frac{43}{15}.\n$$\nSince $H_{\\text{avg}}=\\frac{43}{15} > 0$ and is substantially positive, the segment is strongly hydrophobic. In a folded, water-soluble globular protein, strongly hydrophobic segments are most likely buried in the protein core, shielded from water. Therefore, among the options given, the correct conclusion is that the segment is highly hydrophobic and most likely buried in the protein core (option B). Options A and C are inconsistent with the positive and sizable average, and D is over-specific and not supported by the largely hydrophobic composition without a clear amphipathic pattern.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2143766"}, {"introduction": "The hydrophobic effect is not merely a structural preference; it is a major energetic contributor to a protein's overall thermodynamic stability. We can quantify this contribution by examining the free energy changes associated with moving amino acid side chains between nonpolar and aqueous environments. This final practice [@problem_id:2143777] explores the energetic consequences of mutations, showing you how to calculate the change in a protein's stability, represented as $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{unfolding}}$, when a residue in the hydrophobic core is substituted.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a small, globular protein. In the wild-type version of this protein, a leucine (Leu) residue is located in the protein's hydrophobic core, completely shielded from the surrounding aqueous solution. A mutation is introduced that replaces this leucine with a serine (Ser) residue at the same position. To estimate the impact of this mutation on the protein's stability, we can use a simplified model based on the free energy of transferring amino acid side chains from a nonpolar environment (approximating the protein core) to water.\n\nThe experimentally determined Gibbs free energy of transfer ($\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}$) for moving the relevant side chains from a nonpolar solvent to water are:\n- For the leucine side chain: $\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(\\text{Leu}) = +10.12 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n- For the serine side chain: $\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(\\text{Ser}) = -4.31 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n\nAssuming that the mutation does not significantly alter the overall protein structure and that the primary energetic consequence arises from the different interactions of the side chain with its environment upon unfolding, calculate the change in the Gibbs free energy of unfolding ($\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{unfolding}}$).
