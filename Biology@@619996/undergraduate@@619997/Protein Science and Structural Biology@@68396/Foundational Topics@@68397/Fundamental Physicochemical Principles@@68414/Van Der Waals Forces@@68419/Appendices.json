Liquid B is neopentane (systematic name: 2,2-dimethylpropane), which has a compact, nearly spherical molecular structure. Since they are isomers, they have the same molar mass.

The task is to predict the relationship between their boiling points by considering the nature of the intermolecular forces.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly predicts the relative boiling points and provides the correct physical reasoning?\n\nA. Neopentane will have a higher boiling point than n-pentane because its spherical shape allows for more efficient packing, increasing the density of the liquid and the strength of intermolecular attractions.\n\nB. n-Pentane will have a higher boiling point than neopentane because its larger surface area allows for more significant intermolecular contact, leading to stronger overall London dispersion forces.\n\nC.

For nonpolar species, the attractive potential between two molecules at separation $r$ is well modeled by a term of the form $U(r) \\sim -\\frac{C_{6}}{r^{6}}$, where $C_{6}$ depends on the molecular polarizabilities and ionization energies. While structural isomers have very similar total polarizability and ionization energy, the magnitude of the net dispersion interaction in the condensed phase also depends on molecular shape because shape controls how much surface area can come into close contact and how molecules can orient to maximize instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions.\n\nRelate shape to dispersion strength: A linear molecule (n-pentane) has a larger accessible surface area and anisotropic polarizability tensor that allows favorable alignment with neighbors, producing larger effective contact area and thus stronger overall dispersion attractions. A compact, nearly spherical molecule (neopentane) minimizes contact area and presents more isotropic polarizability, leading to weaker net dispersion interactions between molecules in the liquid.\n\nConnect intermolecular force strength to boiling point: Stronger intermolecular attractions imply a larger enthalpy of vaporization $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$.

Neopentane, being more compact, exhibits weaker, not stronger, dispersion interactions.\n- B is correct: n-pentane’s greater surface area allows more intermolecular contact and stronger cumulative London dispersion forces, yielding a higher boiling point than neopentane.\n- C is incorrect: van der Waals (dispersion) forces also depend on molecular shape and surface area, not only on molar mass or electron count.\n- D is incorrect: both molecules are essentially nonpolar alkanes with no permanent dipole; dipole–dipole interactions are absent. The difference arises from dispersion forces, not permanent dipoles.\n- E is incorrect: boiling does not require breaking C–C covalent bonds; it overcomes intermolecular forces. Intramolecular bond strength is not the controlling factor for boiling point differences between isomers.\n\nConclusion: n-pentane has the higher boiling point due to its larger surface area and correspondingly stronger London dispersion forces.
