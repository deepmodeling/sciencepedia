Tyrosine > Valine > Glutamine", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must analyze the chemical structure of the side chain for each amino acid and determine its potential to act as a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor. A hydrogen bond donor is a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like oxygen or nitrogen). A hydrogen bond acceptor is an electronegative atom (like oxygen or nitrogen) that has at least one lone pair of electrons. The total hydrogen bonding capacity is the sum of the number of bonds it can donate and the number of bonds it can accept.\n\n- **Valine (Val):** The side chain of valine is an isopropyl group, $-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$. This side chain consists solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. The carbon-hydrogen bonds are not sufficiently polarized for the hydrogen atoms to act as hydrogen bond donors. Furthermore, there are no electronegative atoms with lone pairs of electrons, so it cannot act as a hydrogen bond acceptor. Therefore, the hydrogen bonding capacity of Valine's side chain is 0.\n\n- **Tyrosine (Tyr):** The side chain of tyrosine is $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{–}(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_4)\\text{–OH}$. The functionally relevant part for hydrogen bonding is the terminal hydroxyl group ($-\\text{OH}$) attached to the phenyl ring.\n    - **Donor:** The hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group is bonded to a highly electronegative oxygen atom. This makes it a strong hydrogen bond donor. It can donate 1 hydrogen bond.\n    - **Acceptor:** The oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group possesses two lone pairs of electrons. Each lone pair can accept a hydrogen bond from a suitable donor. Thus, it can act as an acceptor for up to 2 hydrogen bonds.\n    - **Total Capacity:** The total hydrogen bonding capacity of Tyrosine's side chain is the sum of its donor and acceptor roles: 1 (donor) + 2 (acceptors) = 3.\n\n- **Glutamine (Gln):** The side chain of glutamine is $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{–CH}_2\\text{–C(=O)NH}_2$. The key functional group is the terminal amide.\n    - **Donor:** The amide group ($-\\text{NH}_2$) has two hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a nitrogen atom. Both of these hydrogens are capable of acting as hydrogen bond donors. It can donate 2 hydrogen bonds.\n    - **Acceptor:** The carbonyl oxygen ($\\text{C=O}$) of the amide group is highly electronegative and has two lone pairs of electrons, allowing it to accept up to 2 hydrogen bonds. The amide nitrogen also has a lone pair, but its availability as an acceptor is reduced due to resonance with the carbonyl group. For calculating the maximum theoretical capacity, we consider the primary acceptor sites. The carbonyl oxygen is a potent acceptor.\n    - **Total Capacity:** The total hydrogen bonding capacity of Glutamine's side chain is the sum of its donor and acceptor roles: 2 (donors) + 2 (acceptors) = 4.\n\nNow, we can rank the amino acids based on their total hydrogen bonding capacity:\n1. Glutamine: 4\n2. Tyrosine: 3\n3. Valine: 0\n\nThe correct ranking from highest to lowest capacity is Glutamine > Tyrosine > Valine.

The side chain becomes fully protonated and can only act as a hydrogen bond donor, completely losing any ability to be an acceptor.\n\nE. The side chain's geometry is altered so severely that it can no longer participate in any hydrogen bonds.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine how the hydrogen bonding potential of an aspartate side chain changes when the environmental pH drops from 7.0 to 4.0. The key to solving this is to understand the relationship between pH, pKa, and the protonation state of the side chain, and how this state dictates its role in hydrogen bonding.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial state at pH 7.0**\n\nThe protonation state of a weak acid, like the carboxyl group of aspartate, is described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$\n\\text{pH} = \\text{pKa} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $[\\text{A}^-]$ is the concentration of the deprotonated (conjugate base) form and $[\\text{HA}]$ is the concentration of the protonated (acid) form. For aspartate, HA is the neutral carboxylic acid side chain ($-\\text{COOH}$), and A⁻ is the negatively charged carboxylate side chain ($-\\text{COO}^-$).\n\nAt the initial pH of 7.0, we have:\n$$\n7.0 = 3.9 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n3.1 = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} = 10^{3.1} \\approx 1259\n$$\nThis ratio indicates that at pH 7.0, the aspartate side chain is overwhelmingly in its deprotonated, carboxylate ($-\\text{COO}^-$) form. A hydrogen bond acceptor is an electronegative atom (like oxygen or nitrogen) with a lone pair of electrons. The carboxylate anion ($-\\text{COO}^-$) has a negative charge distributed over two highly electronegative oxygen atoms, making it an excellent hydrogen bond acceptor. It cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor because it has no hydrogen atom bonded to an electronegative atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the final state at pH 4.0**\n\nNow, we consider the final pH of 4.0. We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation again:\n$$\n4.0 = 3.9 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n0.1 = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} = 10^{0.1} \\approx 1.26\n$$\nThis ratio shows that at pH 4.0, which is very close to the pKa, there are significant populations of both the protonated (aspartic acid, $-\\text{COOH}$) and deprotonated (aspartate, $-\\text{COO}^-$) forms. The deprotonated form is slightly more abundant, but a substantial fraction of the side chains (approximately $1 / (1+1.26) \\approx 44\\%$) are now in the protonated $-\\text{COOH}$ form.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the change in hydrogen bonding potential**\n\nLet's analyze the hydrogen bonding potential of the newly prominent protonated form, the carboxylic acid ($-\\text{COOH}$).\n- **Hydrogen Bond Donor:** The $-\\text{COOH}$ group has a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. This hydrogen is polarized and can be \"donated\" to form a hydrogen bond with a suitable acceptor. Therefore, the protonated form gains the ability to be a hydrogen bond donor.\n- **Hydrogen Bond Acceptor:** In the protonated form, the carbonyl oxygen (C=O) still has lone pairs and can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor. However, the overall acceptor strength of the $-\\text{COOH}$ group is significantly less than that of the negatively charged $-\\text{COO}^-$ group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the initial and final states:\n- At pH 7.0, the side chain is almost exclusively a strong hydrogen bond acceptor ($-\\text{COO}^-$).\n- At pH 4.0, a significant portion of the side chains convert to the protonated form ($-\\text{COOH}$). This conversion has two main effects:\n    1. The population of strong hydrogen bond acceptors ($-\\text{COO}^-$) is significantly reduced, thus diminishing the side chain's overall ability to act as an acceptor.\n    2. A new capability is introduced: the ability to act as a hydrogen bond donor via the $-\\text{COOH}$ group.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n- **A. The side chain becomes predominantly protonated, significantly diminishing its ability to act as a hydrogen bond acceptor while gaining the ability to act as a hydrogen bond donor.** This statement correctly captures both key changes. While \"predominantly\" might be a slight overstatement as the deprotonated form is still slightly more common, the *change* is driven by the large increase in the protonated population. It correctly identifies the diminished acceptor role and the gained donor role. This is the most accurate description.\n- **B. The side chain becomes predominantly deprotonated, which enhances its ability to act as a hydrogen bond acceptor.** This is incorrect. The shift from pH 7 to 4 causes protonation, not deprotonation.\n- **C. The pH change has no significant effect on the hydrogen bonding potential because the side chain can act as an acceptor in both its protonated and deprotonated forms.** This is incorrect. The change is significant because the acceptor strength is greatly diminished and the donor ability is gained.\n- **D. The side chain becomes fully protonated and can only act as a hydrogen bond donor, completely losing any ability to be an acceptor.** This is incorrect. The side chain is not fully protonated at pH 4.0, and the protonated form can still act as an acceptor at its carbonyl oxygen.\n- **E. The side chain's geometry is altered so severely that it can no longer participate in any hydrogen bonds.** This is a gross exaggeration. Changes in protonation state do not typically prevent hydrogen bonding altogether.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the best description of the change.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2114145"}]}
