Once these side chains are closely packed in the protein's interior, short-range attractive forces known as van der Waals (vdW) interactions, specifically London dispersion forces, contribute significantly to the overall stability of the folded structure.\n\nConsider the following three amino acids with their respective nonpolar side chains: Alanine (side chain: -CH3), Leucine (side chain: -CH2-CH(CH3)2), and Phenylalanine (side chain: -CH2-C6H5).\n\nAssuming these side chains are buried in the hydrophobic core of a globular protein, they will contribute to the protein's stability through vdW interactions.

A salt bridge is an electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged groups. To solve this, we must determine the charge state of each amino acid's side chain at both pH values.\n\nThe charge state of an ionizable group is determined by comparing the solution's pH to the group's pKa. The general rules are:\n1.  If pH  pKa, the group is predominantly in its protonated form.\n2.  If pH  pKa, the group is predominantly in its deprotonated form.\n\nLet's analyze the side chains involved:\n- Aspartate side chain: This is a carboxylic acid group ($R\\text{-COOH}$). Its protonated form is neutral ($R\\text{-COOH}$), and its deprotonated form is negatively charged ($R\\text{-COO}^-$). Its pKa is 4.0.\n- Lysine side chain: This is an amino group ($R\\text{-NH}_2$). Its protonated form is positively charged ($R\\text{-NH}_3^+$), and its deprotonated form is neutral ($R\\text{-NH}_2$). Its pKa is 10.5.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the state at the initial pH of 7.0.**\n- For the aspartate side chain (pKa = 4.0): The pH (7.0) is greater than the pKa (4.0). Therefore, the side chain will be predominantly in its deprotonated form, which is negatively charged ($\\text{COO}^-$).\n- For the lysine side chain (pKa = 10.5): The pH (7.0) is less than the pKa (10.5). Therefore, the side chain will be predominantly in its protonated form, which is positively charged ($\\text{NH}_3^+$).\nAt pH 7.0, we have a negatively charged aspartate ($\\text{COO}^-$) and a positively charged lysine ($\\text{NH}_3^+$). These opposite charges allow for a strong electrostatic attraction, forming a stable salt bridge. This confirms the initial condition stated in the problem.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the state at the final pH of 12.0.**\n- For the aspartate side chain (pKa = 4.0): The pH (12.0) is still much greater than the pKa (4.0). The side chain will remain in its deprotonated form, negatively charged ($\\text{COO}^-$).\n- For the lysine side chain (pKa = 10.5): The pH (12.0) is now greater than the pKa (10.5). Therefore, the side chain will switch to its predominantly deprotonated form, which is neutral ($\\text{NH}_2$).\nAt pH 12.0, we have a negatively charged aspartate ($\\text{COO}^-$) and a neutral lysine ($\\text{NH}_2$).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the consequence for the salt bridge.**\nA salt bridge requires the interaction of oppositely charged groups. At pH 12.0, the lysine side chain has lost its positive charge and become neutral. The electrostatic attraction between the negative charge on the aspartate and the now-neutral lysine is eliminated. Consequently, the salt bridge is broken or disrupted.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n- A. The salt bridge will be disrupted because the aspartate side chain will become protonated, losing its negative charge. This is incorrect. At pH 12.0, aspartate remains deprotonated and negatively charged.\n- B. The salt bridge will remain intact and may even become stronger. This is incorrect. The salt bridge is broken.\n- C. The salt bridge will be disrupted because both side chains will become neutral. This is incorrect. The aspartate side chain remains negatively charged.\n- D. The salt bridge will be disrupted because the lysine side chain will become deprotonated, losing its positive charge. This matches our analysis perfectly. The shift in pH above lysine's pKa causes it to lose its proton and positive charge, breaking the interaction.\n- E. The salt bridge will be unaffected by the change in pH because the pKa values are far from the initial pH. This is incorrect. The final pH (12.0) is on the other side of lysine's pKa, which is the critical factor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2122509"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates your understanding from analysis to design, placing you in the role of a protein engineer with a specific goal.

Structural analysis of Dimerase reveals that a key interaction involves the side chain of an Alanine at position 84 (Ala84) on Monomer A fitting into a tight, hydrophobic pocket on the surface of Monomer B. This pocket is formed by the side chains of a Leucine at position 112 (Leu112) and a Valine at position 115 (Val115). In the isolated monomer, the Ala84 residue is located on a surface-exposed loop and does not participate in the stabilization of the monomer's hydrophobic core.\n\nA protein engineer aims to disrupt the Dimerase quaternary structure by introducing a single point mutation at position 84 on Monomer A. The goal is to select a mutation that is most likely to maximally destabilize the dimer assembly through a combination of two specific mechanisms: (1) creating significant steric repulsion within the binding pocket, and (2) introducing an unsatisfied, buried electrical charge into the hydrophobic interface. The experiment is conducted in a buffer at a physiological pH of 7.4. For your reference, the approximate side-chain pKa values for Aspartic Acid and Lysine are 3.9 and 10.5, respectively.\n\nWhich of the following single point mutations of Ala84 is most likely to achieve this stated goal without significantly compromising the stability of the monomeric fold?\n\nA. Ala84Gly\n\nB. Ala84Phe\n\nC. Ala84Asp\n\nD. Ala84Lys\n\nE.

Thus:\n- For Asp with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a} \\approx 3.9$ at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.4$, $\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}  0$, so Asp is predominantly deprotonated and negatively charged.\n- For Lys with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a} \\approx 10.5$ at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.4$, $\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}  0$, so Lys is predominantly protonated and positively charged.\n\nPrinciple 3 (buried unsatisfied charge): Burying a charged side chain in a hydrophobic environment without a complementary charge or hydrogen-bonding partner incurs a large desolvation penalty and is strongly destabilizing to the interface.\n\nPrinciple 4 (monomer stability constraints): Ala84 is on a surface-exposed loop and does not stabilize the monomeric core. Substitutions that severely alter backbone conformational preferences (e.g., Pro, Gly) can destabilize loops; bulky hydrophobes on solvent-exposed surfaces can reduce solubility; polar or charged residues are generally well tolerated on solvent-exposed surfaces in the monomer.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A. Ala84Gly: Gly is smaller than Ala, reduces steric bulk and increases backbone flexibility. It does not introduce charge. It fails to produce steric repulsion and fails to introduce a buried charge; it may also destabilize the monomeric loop by increasing flexibility.\n- B. Ala84Phe: Phe is bulky and hydrophobic; it can create steric clash in a tight pocket (satisfies mechanism (i)) but does not introduce a charge (fails mechanism (ii)). On the monomer surface, a large hydrophobe may be unfavorable due to solvent exposure and potential aggregation, risking monomer stability/solubility.\n- C. Ala84Asp: Asp introduces a negative charge at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.4$ (satisfies mechanism (ii)). However, Asp’s side chain is relatively short and not especially bulky, so it provides limited steric repulsion compared to larger residues (only partly satisfies mechanism (i)). Asp on a solvent-exposed loop is generally tolerated in the monomer.\n- D. Ala84Lys: Lys introduces a positive charge at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.4$ (satisfies mechanism (ii)) and has a long, bulky side chain that will strongly sterically clash within a tight hydrophobic pocket (satisfies mechanism (i)). In the monomer, Lys on a surface-exposed loop is well tolerated due to favorable solvation and typically does not compromise the monomeric fold; upon dimerization, the now-buried charged group will be highly destabilizing in the hydrophobic interface.\n- E. Ala84Pro: Pro can significantly perturb local backbone dihedral angles and often destabilizes loops or disrupts secondary structure; it is not charged and only modestly bulky. It fails mechanism (ii) and risks compromising monomer stability.\n\nConclusion: Ala84Lys best maximizes both steric repulsion and the introduction of an unsatisfied buried charge in the dimer interface, while being well tolerated on the monomer’s solvent-exposed loop, thereby minimally affecting the monomeric fold.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2122552"}]}
