By considering how a water-soluble protein must readapt its structure within a nonpolar solvent, we can gain a profound appreciation for the hydrophobic effect as a paramount organizing force in our aqueous biological world. This practice will sharpen your intuition for the thermodynamic principles of solvation and how the simple rule of \"like dissolves like\" ultimately dictates a protein's complex three-dimensional architecture [@problem_id:2150392].", "problem": "A biochemist isolates a novel, water-soluble, globular protein named \"Aquaglobin\" from a deep-sea thermophilic bacterium. In its native aqueous environment, buffered at neutral pH, Aquaglobin folds into a stable, compact tertiary structure. An experiment is conducted where a solution of purified Aquaglobin is carefully transferred into an excess volume of a nonpolar organic solvent, octane ($C_{8}H_{18}$). Assuming the protein does not immediately precipitate and is given time to reach a new thermodynamically stable conformation, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected fundamental rearrangement of its tertiary structure?\n\nA. The protein will completely denature into an unstructured random coil, as the nonpolar solvent is incapable of supporting any specific three-dimensional fold.\n\nB. The protein's structure will rearrange into a new, stable fold that is effectively an \"inversion\" of its aqueous structure, where hydrophobic residues are exposed on the surface and hydrophilic residues are buried in the core.\n\nC. The protein's tertiary structure will remain largely unchanged because the sequence of amino acids and the covalent peptide bonds, which are the primary determinants of the fold, are unaffected by the change in solvent.\n\nD. The protein molecules will form large aggregates by sticking their hydrophobic cores together, but the tertiary structure of each individual protein monomer will be preserved.", "solution": "We seek the thermodynamically most stable conformation of a globular protein when transferred from water to a nonpolar solvent (octane), assuming sufficient time to equilibrate and no immediate precipitation. The criterion for stability is minimization of the Gibbs free energy of the protein plus solvent:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{total}} - T \\Delta S_{\\text{total}}.\n$$\nFor a protein fold in a given solvent, this can be partitioned into intramolecular and solvation contributions:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}^{\\text{(solvent)}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{intra}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{solv}},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\text{intra}}$ accounts for intramolecular interactions (hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, salt bridges) and conformational entropy, and $\\Delta G_{\\text{solv}}$ is the change in solvation free energy due to the exposure/burial of different chemical groups at the protein surface.\n\nStep 1: Contrast solvent effects on different residue types.\n- In water, transfer of hydrophobic side chains from solvent to the protein interior is favorable due to the hydrophobic effect (release of structured water), while exposure of polar/charged groups to water is favorable due to strong solvation. Qualitatively, for a hydrophobic side chain, the free energy change to move from water to a nonpolar environment is negative:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(\\text{hydrophobic}; \\text{water} \\to \\text{octane}) < 0,\n$$\nwhereas for polar or charged groups it is positive:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(\\text{polar/charged}; \\text{water} \\to \\text{octane}) > 0.\n$$\nTherefore, in a nonpolar solvent, exposing hydrophobic side chains to solvent is favorable, while exposing polar/charged groups is highly unfavorable.\n\nStep 2: Backbone hydrogen bonding constraints in nonpolar solvent.\nThe peptide backbone contains polar amide N–H and carbonyl C=O groups. In water, these are well solvated; in octane, the solvent cannot donate or accept strong hydrogen bonds. Exposing backbone polar groups without compensation incurs a large positive solvation penalty. Folding into secondary structures that form intramolecular hydrogen bonds (e.g., $\\alpha$ helices, $\\beta$ sheets) reduces this penalty by satisfying backbone donors and acceptors internally, thereby making a compact, internally hydrogen-bonded structure favorable over a random coil in a nonpolar medium.\n\nStep 3: Electrostatics in low dielectric and salt bridges.\nThe electrostatic interaction energy between charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ separated by $r$ is\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon_{r}} \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r}.\n$$\nOctane has a small $\\epsilon_{r}$, so ion pairing (salt bridges) is strengthened once charges are desolvated. However, desolvation of isolated charges from water to octane is strongly unfavorable. A net favorable arrangement in octane is to bury polar and charged side chains in the core where they are mutually compensated via hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, minimizing exposure to the nonpolar solvent.\n\nStep 4: Predicting the rearranged tertiary structure.\nCombining Steps 1–3, the thermodynamically favored rearrangement in a nonpolar solvent is an “inside-out” globule: hydrophobic residues become solvent-exposed because their solvation in octane is favorable, whereas polar and charged residues are buried in the core and engaged in intramolecular networks (hydrogen bonds and ion pairs) to offset desolvation penalties. Symbolically, if $A_{\\text{exp}}^{\\text{hydroph}}$ and $A_{\\text{exp}}^{\\text{polar}}$ denote exposed surface areas of hydrophobic and polar residues, then minimizing\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{solv}} \\approx \\gamma_{\\text{hydroph}}^{\\text{oct}} A_{\\text{exp}}^{\\text{hydroph}} + \\gamma_{\\text{polar}}^{\\text{oct}} A_{\\text{exp}}^{\\text{polar}},\n$$\nwith $\\gamma_{\\text{hydroph}}^{\\text{oct}} < 0$ and $\\gamma_{\\text{polar}}^{\\text{oct}} \\gg 0$, drives $A_{\\text{exp}}^{\\text{hydroph}}$ large and $A_{\\text{exp}}^{\\text{polar}}$ small, i.e., an inverted surface composition relative to the aqueous fold.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the options.\n- Option A (complete denaturation to a random coil) is disfavored because a random coil would expose many backbone and polar side chains to octane without compensating interactions, giving a large positive $\\Delta G_{\\text{solv}}$. Formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and compactness reduce this penalty, so a folded state is favored over a coil in nonpolar media.\n- Option C (structure unchanged) is incorrect because the dominant driving forces for tertiary structure include solvent-dependent solvation terms; changing from water to octane reverses the relative stabilities of exposed/buried residue types, so the fold must adapt to the new environment.\n- Option D (aggregation with preserved monomer tertiary structure) is inconsistent because the aqueous-exposed surface of a native globular protein is rich in polar residues, which are poorly solvated in octane. Preserving that surface while avoiding refolding would be highly unfavorable. Aggregation would not circumvent the need to bury polar surfaces unless substantial refolding occurs, so preservation of the original monomer tertiary structure is unlikely.\n- Option B precisely states the expected rearrangement: an “inversion” where hydrophobic residues are solvent-exposed and polar residues are buried, forming a new, stable, compact fold in the nonpolar solvent.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2150392"}, {"introduction": "A protein's solubility is not a fixed characteristic; it is dynamically tuned by its chemical surroundings, particularly the pH of the solution. This exercise delves into the concept of the isoelectric point ($pI$), the specific pH at which a protein has no net electrical charge, and explores the underlying reasons for its minimal solubility under these conditions. Mastering this principle is crucial, as it underpins many essential laboratory techniques, including protein purification and crystallization [@problem_id:2150379].", "problem": "A fundamental property of a protein is its isoelectric point ($pI$), which is the specific pH at which the protein carries no net electrical charge. A common laboratory observation is that a protein's solubility in an aqueous buffer is at a minimum when the pH of the solution is equal to the protein's $pI$. This phenomenon, known as isoelectric precipitation, is a consequence of the balance between protein-protein interactions and protein-water interactions.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for why a protein is typically least soluble at its isoelectric point?\n\nA. At the isoelectric point, the protein molecules unfold, exposing their hydrophobic interiors. These exposed hydrophobic regions interact with each other, leading to aggregation and a decrease in solubility.\n\nB. At the isoelectric point, the protein molecules have a net charge of zero. This complete lack of charge eliminates all electrostatic interactions with polar water molecules, rendering the protein insoluble.\n\nC. At the isoelectric point, the net charge on the protein molecules is zero. This minimizes electrostatic repulsion between adjacent protein molecules, allowing attractive intermolecular forces to promote aggregation. Concurrently, the diminished net charge reduces the extent of the ordered hydration shell, weakening protein-water interactions relative to protein-protein interactions.\n\nD. At the isoelectric point, the concentration of $H^+$ and $OH^-$ ions is equal, which neutralizes all charged side chains on the protein surface. This neutralization process allows strong intermolecular salt bridges to form between protein molecules, causing them to precipitate.\n\nE. At the isoelectric point, water molecules are forced to form a highly ordered, \"ice-like\" cage structure around the uncharged protein molecules. This energetically unfavorable ordering of water is minimized when protein molecules aggregate, thus driving them out of solution.", "solution": "We consider how protein solubility depends on intermolecular interactions and protein-water interactions as a function of pH. Let $Z_{\\text{net}}(pH)$ denote the protein’s net charge; by definition, at $pH=pI$ one has $Z_{\\text{net}}=0$. The electrostatic repulsion between two proteins in electrolyte solution is well described by screened Coulomb (Debye-Hückel-type) interactions. If $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ is an effective charge of a protein, the repulsive potential at center-to-center separation $r$ has the form\n$$\nU_{\\text{el}}(r)\\approx \\frac{Z_{\\text{eff}}^{2} e^{2}}{4\\pi \\varepsilon r}\\,\\exp(-\\kappa r),\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is the dielectric permittivity of the medium and $\\kappa^{-1}$ is the Debye length set by the ionic strength. This repulsive barrier scales with $Z_{\\text{eff}}^{2}$; near $pH=pI$ one has $Z_{\\text{eff}}\\to 0$ and thus $U_{\\text{el}}(r)$ is minimized.\n\nProteins also experience attractive forces, such as van der Waals interactions, which can be modeled by a Hamaker-type potential $U_{\\text{vdW}}(r)<0$, and additional short-range attractions (e.g., hydrophobic patch interactions, specific salt bridges between localized oppositely charged patches). The total pair potential can be written schematically as\n$$\nU(r)=U_{\\text{el}}(r)+U_{\\text{vdW}}(r)+U_{\\text{other}}(r).\n$$\nA standard measure of net interaction relevant to phase behavior and solubility is the second virial coefficient,\n$$\nB_{2}\\propto \\int \\bigl(1-\\exp[-U(r)/(k_{B}T)]\\bigr)\\,d\\vec{r}.\n$$\nWhen repulsion is strong (large $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ away from $pI$), $U(r)$ is more positive at intermediate $r$, making $B_{2}$ less negative or positive, which stabilizes proteins in solution. At $pH=pI$, $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ is minimized, reducing $U_{\\text{el}}(r)$, so $U(r)$ is dominated by attractive terms, driving $B_{2}$ to more negative values and favoring aggregation and precipitation, hence minimal solubility.\n\nConcurrently, the hydration and protein-water interactions depend on surface charge and the resulting structured water and counterion atmosphere. Reducing the net surface charge density diminishes the electrostatic contribution to the hydration free energy and compresses the diffuse layer; this weakens protein-water interactions relative to protein-protein attractions. Importantly, $Z_{\\text{net}}=0$ does not imply the absence of local charges or dipoles; proteins retain charged and polar patches, so electrostatic interactions with water are not eliminated, only their net long-range effect is minimized.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because proteins do not generally unfold at $pH=pI$; unfolding is not required to explain isoelectric precipitation.\n- B is incorrect because $Z_{\\text{net}}=0$ does not eliminate all electrostatic interactions with water; local charges and dipoles persist, and proteins remain hydrated.\n- C correctly combines the two key effects: minimized electrostatic repulsion between proteins due to $Z_{\\text{net}}=0$, allowing attractive forces to promote aggregation, and a concurrent reduction in the net charge–driven hydration, weakening protein-water interactions relative to protein-protein interactions.\n- D is incorrect because $[H^+]=[OH^-]$ only at $pH=7$, whereas $pI$ is protein-specific and not necessarily equal to $7$, and side chains are not all neutralized; the net charge is zero but individual residues can remain charged.\n- E invokes an “ice-like” water structure mechanism that is not the primary determinant of minimal solubility at $pI$ and misattributes a hydrophobic-clathrate picture to a phenomenon governed mainly by electrostatics and colloidal interactions.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete explanation is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2150379"}, {"introduction": "How can we experimentally \"see\" the molecular-level interactions between a protein and its water solvent? This practice bridges the gap between theoretical models and real-world data by introducing a sophisticated technique, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, used to map these very interactions.

Experimental data confirm that this peptide folds into a stable, monomeric, right-handed alpha-helix in an aqueous buffer at neutral pH.\n\nTo investigate the peptide's interaction with the solvent, a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiment is performed. In this experiment, the strong signal from the protons of the bulk water solvent is selectively saturated using a tailored radiofrequency pulse. Due to a phenomenon called the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE), this saturation can be transferred through space to peptide protons that are in close proximity (typically less than 5 Å) to water molecules. The transfer of saturation results in a quantifiable decrease in the signal intensity of these specific peptide protons.\n\nAssuming the peptide adopts its stable alpha-helical conformation, which of the following groups of amino acid residues is predicted to show the most significant decrease in their side-chain proton signal intensities upon saturation of the water signal?\n\nA.

Under steady-state saturation of water, the decrease in the intensity of a peptide proton signal is proportional to the sum of cross-relaxation rates to nearby water protons and is therefore larger for protons that are, on average, closer to water and/or are associated with longer local correlation times due to bound or structured water.

These charged side chains are strongly solvated by water via electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, resulting in a high local density of water protons within the NOE-effective distance (typically less than $5\\,\\text{\\AA}$) and often with longer residence times, both of which increase the effective $\\sigma_{IW}$ and thus the attenuation upon water saturation.\n\nThe peptide is confirmed to be a stable, monomeric, right-handed alpha-helix. Alpha-helices have a periodicity of approximately $3.6$ residues per turn, so residues $i$, $i+3$, and $i+4$ lie on the same face. The given sequence,\nLeu-Glu-Lys-Leu-Ala-Glu-Lys-Leu-Leu-Glu-Lys-Leu-Ala-Lys,\ndisplays an alternating pattern of hydrophobic (Leu, Ala) and charged (Lys, Glu) residues such that the helix is amphipathic: hydrophobic residues cluster on one face and charged residues on the opposite face. In water, the charged face is preferentially solvent-exposed and hydrated, while the hydrophobic face is comparatively less hydrated. Therefore, the side-chain protons of Lys and Glu experience more frequent and closer contacts with water, leading to larger cross-relaxation rates and stronger decreases in NMR signal intensity upon saturation of the water resonance.\n\nHydrophobic side chains such as Leu and Ala generally have fewer tightly associated waters and shorter water residence times near their methyl and methylene protons, yielding smaller $\\sigma_{IW}$ values and thus smaller intensity decreases. The notion that all residues would be equally affected is inconsistent with the amphipathic structure and solvent-accessibility differences, and restricting the effect only to terminal residues ignores the continuous solvent exposure along the helix surface. Finally, the absence of any significant change contradicts the expected NOE-mediated saturation transfer for solvent-exposed side-chain protons.\n\nTherefore, the residues predicted to show the most significant decrease in side-chain proton signal intensities are the Lysine and Glutamic acid residues.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2150386"}]}
