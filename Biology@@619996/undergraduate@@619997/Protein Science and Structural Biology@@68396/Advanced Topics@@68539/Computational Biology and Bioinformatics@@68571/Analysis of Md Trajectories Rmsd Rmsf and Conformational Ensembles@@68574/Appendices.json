Protein G is a globular enzyme known to possess a well-defined tertiary structure, which includes a stable core composed of alpha-helices and beta-sheets linked by flexible loop regions. Protein I is an Intrinsically Disordered Protein (IDP), which does not adopt a stable three-dimensional structure in its native state and instead exists as a dynamic conformational ensemble.\n\nThe biophysicist performs a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation for each protein under identical physiological conditions to study their dynamic properties. After the simulations, she calculates the per-residue Root-Mean-Square Fluctuation (RMSF) of the alpha-carbon atom for each residue in both proteins. The RMSF for a given residue is a measure of its average positional deviation from a mean position over time, thus quantifying its local flexibility.\n\nBased on the fundamental structural differences between a globular protein and an IDP, which of the following statements provides the most accurate comparison of the expected RMSF plots (RMSF value vs. residue index from 1 to 200) for Protein G and Protein I?\n\nA. Protein G's plot will show low RMSF values for residues in alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with distinct peaks of high RMSF for residues in loop regions and at the N- and C-termini. Protein I's plot will show consistently high RMSF values across most of its sequence, generally lacking the deep troughs seen in Protein G's plot.\n\nB. Both proteins will exhibit nearly identical RMSF plots, characterized by low fluctuations in the central region (residues 50-150) and high fluctuations at the N- and C-termini, as their overall length is the same.\n\nC. Protein G's plot will show uniformly low RMSF values across the entire sequence because it is rigidly folded. Protein I's plot will also show low RMSF values because the average position of each residue over a long simulation will be near the center of mass.\n\nD. Protein I's plot will show low RMSF values in its structured regions and high RMSF values in its loop regions. Protein G's plot will show uniformly high RMSF values because enzymes must be flexible to function.\n\nE. Protein G's plot will have high RMSF values for residues in alpha-helices because they are dynamic structures, and low RMSF values for beta-sheets. Protein I's plot will be a perfectly straight, horizontal line, indicating that every residue experiences the exact same degree of fluctuation.", "solution": "Define the per-residue RMSF for residue index $i$ from an MD trajectory with positions $\\mathbf{r}_{i}(t)$ and time-average $\\langle \\mathbf{r}_{i} \\rangle$ as\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSF}_{i}=\\left\\langle \\left| \\mathbf{r}_{i}(t)-\\langle \\mathbf{r}_{i} \\rangle \\right|^{2} \\right\\rangle^{\\frac{1}{2}},\n$$\nor, in a discrete trajectory with $N$ frames,\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSF}_{i}=\\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\left| \\mathbf{r}_{i}(t_{k})-\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{m=1}^{N}\\mathbf{r}_{i}(t_{m}) \\right|^{2} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n$$\nBy definition, $\\mathrm{RMSF}_{i}$ quantifies the amplitude of local positional fluctuations about the residue’s mean position over time, not its distance from a global reference such as the center of mass.\n\nFor a globular protein with a well-defined tertiary structure, the folded core imposes geometrical and energetic constraints that reduce fluctuations in ordered secondary-structure elements (helices and sheets). Flexible loops and the N- and C-termini lack the same degree of stabilizing contacts and thus exhibit larger excursions from their mean positions. Therefore, the expected RMSF versus residue index for a globular enzyme shows low baselines (troughs) across helices and sheets and pronounced peaks at loop regions and termini.\n\nFor an intrinsically disordered protein lacking a stable three-dimensional fold, residues do not remain in a single well-stabilized conformation. The ensemble is highly dynamic with weak or transient long-range contacts, leading to broadly elevated fluctuations across most of the sequence. While local sequence features can modulate flexibility and the termini can still be among the most mobile, the profile generally lacks the deep, extended troughs characteristic of stable helices and sheets in a folded core.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A matches the above physical picture: Protein G shows low RMSF in helices and sheets with peaks at loops and termini; Protein I shows consistently higher RMSF across most residues without deep troughs.\n- B is incorrect because identical length does not imply similar RMSF profiles; folding state dominates RMSF patterns.\n- C is incorrect because Protein G is not uniformly rigid (loops and termini are flexible), and RMSF measures fluctuations about each residue’s own mean, so extensive sampling does not force low RMSF for an IDP.\n- D is incorrect because it inverts expectations: Protein I lacks persistent structured regions with uniformly low RMSF, and Protein G is not uniformly high in RMSF.\n- E is incorrect because helices in folded proteins are typically relatively rigid (low RMSF), and an IDP will not produce a perfectly flat RMSF line.\n\nThus, the most accurate comparison is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2098847"}, {"introduction": "Building upon a conceptual understanding of $\\text{RMSF}$, this exercise transitions to a quantitative application.
