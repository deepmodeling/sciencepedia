Through structural analysis, they hypothesize that a specific tryptophan residue at position 88 (Trp88) plays a critical role in substrate binding. To test this hypothesis experimentally, the engineer aims to create a comprehensive mutational library where the Trp88 residue is systematically replaced by all 19 other standard proteinogenic amino acids.

It is not targeted to a single codon and will introduce many off-target mutations, producing a heterogeneous library that is inefficient for isolating the specific set of $19$ single-site substitutions at residue $88$. Therefore, it is not the most direct or efficient approach for this specific library.\n\n- Option B (site-directed mutagenesis with a non-degenerate primer to Alanine): This produces a single specific substitution (Trp88 to Ala88). It cannot generate the full set of $19$ substitutions in one step, so it is not suitable for creating the comprehensive library.\n\n- Option C (DNA shuffling): DNA shuffling recombines homologous sequences to redistribute existing mutations among related sequences. It is not designed to introduce all $19$ substitutions at a specific codon in the wild-type gene and would not directly yield the focused single-site variant set.\n\n- Option D (site-directed mutagenesis with a degenerate primer containing an NNK codon at residue $88$): In oligonucleotide notation, $N$ denotes any nucleotide and $K$ denotes $G$ or $T$. An NNK codon ($4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32$ codons) covers all $20$ standard amino acids with minimal stop-codon inclusion. Specifically, among stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA), only TAG fits NNK (third base $G$), so the stop fraction is minimized. Using a degenerate primer bearing NNK exactly at the Trp88 codon generates a focused library comprising all single-codon variants at that position, efficiently covering all $19$ non-tryptophan amino acids (and typically the original Trp as well), with minimal unwanted diversification elsewhere. This is the standard, most direct method for saturation mutagenesis at a single site.\n\n- Option E (random insertion mutagenesis with a transposon): This creates insertions at random positions, often causing frameshifts or disruptive insertions, not single-codon substitutions. It does not generate the desired single-site substitution library.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and efficient technique for generating a comprehensive single-site saturation library at residue $88$ is site-directed mutagenesis using a degenerate NNK codon at the position of interest.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2108788"}, {"introduction": "Directed evolution powerfully demonstrates the principle \"you get what you screen for,\" and the outcomes are dictated entirely by the applied selection pressures. This exercise presents a realistic dataset from a hypothetical evolution experiment, prompting you to analyze the results and identify a common phenomenon in protein engineering: the evolutionary trade-off. Learning to interpret such data is essential for understanding the complex relationship between a protein's function, its stability, and the environment in which it operates. [@problem_id:2108752]", "problem": "A research group is attempting to engineer a wild-type (WT) esterase, which is naturally highly active and stable in an aqueous buffer, to function efficiently in the non-polar organic solvent hexane. They employ directed evolution using yeast display. The process involves creating a library of enzyme variants, displaying them on the surface of yeast cells, and then using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to select for variants that show the highest catalytic activity towards a fluorogenic substrate. The key step in the selection is that the sorting is performed with the yeast cells suspended in pure hexane.\n\nAfter several rounds of selection and evolution, the researchers characterize the original WT enzyme and two promising variants: Variant 1 (V1), isolated from an early round of selection, and Variant 2 (V2), isolated from a late round. The results of their characterization are summarized in the table below. The catalytic efficiency is a relative measure based on the WT enzyme's activity in hexane.\n\n| Enzyme Variant | Relative Catalytic Efficiency ($k_{cat}/K_M$) in Hexane | Relative Catalytic Efficiency ($k_{cat}/K_M$) in Aqueous Buffer | Thermal Stability, $T_m$ (Â°C) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Wild-Type (WT) | 1.0 | 100 | 65 |\n| Variant 1 (V1) | 45.0 | 30 | 58 |\n| Variant 2 (V2) | 150.0 | 5 | 52 |\n\nBased on the data provided, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the observed changes across the enzyme variants?\n\nA. The selection pressure for activity in hexane favors mutations that compromise the enzyme's structural stability and its catalytic function in its native aqueous environment.\n\nB. The process of directed evolution has selected for enzymes with overall enhanced catalytic power and stability, making Variant 2 a superior enzyme under all conditions.\n\nC. The decrease in thermal stability ($T_m$) is the primary reason for the increased activity in hexane, as a more flexible enzyme structure is required for catalysis in non-polar solvents.\n\nD. The experimental results suggest a flaw in the directed evolution methodology, as it is generally expected for catalytic efficiency to improve or remain constant in all environments during selection.\n\nE. The selection for activity in hexane has incidentally also selected for increased thermal stability, which is a common outcome in directed evolution experiments.", "solution": "We proceed by extracting and comparing the reported properties across environments and variants, then applying principles of directed evolution and protein biophysics to infer the most fundamental explanation, and finally testing each option against these principles and the data.\n\nFirst, the relative catalytic efficiencies show strong environment-specific changes. In hexane, the values increase across evolution: WT has $1.0$, V1 has $45.0$, and V2 has $150.0$, indicating that selection in hexane successfully enriched variants with much higher $k_{cat}/K_{M}$ in the selected non-polar solvent. In contrast, in aqueous buffer the values decrease across the same trajectory: WT has $100$, V1 has $30$, and V2 has $5$, showing a substantial loss of catalytic efficiency in the native aqueous environment as variants adapt to hexane. Second, thermal stability, measured as $T_{m}$, decreases monotonically with evolution: WT at 65, V1 at 58, and V2 at 52, indicating that mutations improving hexane activity are associated with reduced thermostability. Together these observations reveal an environment-specific gain in catalytic efficiency coupled to losses in both aqueous catalytic efficiency and thermal stability, a classic tradeoff.\n\nNext, we apply the core principle of directed evolution: selection enriches properties that are advantageous under the specific screening conditions and does not directly optimize properties not coupled to the selection readout. Here, the FACS-based selection was performed with yeast in hexane using a fluorogenic substrate. Therefore, the dominant selection pressure is for catalytic turnover that yields fluorescence in hexane. There is no selection pressure to maintain aqueous activity or thermal stability unless they are mechanistically linked to hexane activity. In protein engineering, activity-stability tradeoffs are common: mutations that shift dynamics, surface polarity, or active-site solvation to favor catalysis in a very different solvent can be destabilizing and can degrade performance in the original environment. For enzymes, solvent polarity strongly affects folding energetics, side-chain packing, and active-site hydration and electrostatics. Mutations that enable catalysis in non-polar solvent (for example, by increasing dynamics in a dehydrated active site or by altering surface hydrophobicity) can compromise the foldâs stability and the finely tuned interactions needed for optimal aqueous catalysis. Thus, the observed patterns are expected from environment-specific selection and negative pleiotropy between traits.\n\nWe now evaluate each statement against the data and principles:\n- Option A states that selection for hexane activity favors mutations that compromise structural stability and catalytic function in the native aqueous environment. This matches the observed increases in hexane $k_{cat}/K_{M}$ together with decreases in aqueous $k_{cat}/K_{M}$ and $T_{m}$, and it correctly attributes these outcomes to the selection pressure being specific to hexane.\n- Option B claims overall enhancement of catalytic power and stability, making V2 superior under all conditions. This is contradicted by the large decreases in aqueous $k_{cat}/K_{M}$ and in $T_{m}$ for V2 relative to WT.\n- Option C attributes increased activity in hexane primarily to decreased $T_{m}$ (increased flexibility). While decreased stability and altered dynamics can accompany shifts in solvent adaptation, the data do not establish causality, and decreased $T_{m}$ is neither generally necessary nor sufficient for increased activity in organic solvents; in fact, enhanced rigidity sometimes benefits enzymes in non-aqueous environments. Thus this mechanistic claim is not the most accurate or fundamental explanation.\n- Option D suggests a flaw because catalytic efficiency should improve or remain constant in all environments. This contradicts the foundational principle that directed evolution optimizes for the specific screening environment and tradeoffs across environments are common.\n- Option E asserts that selection incidentally increased thermal stability, which is directly refuted by the observed decreases in $T_{m}$.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that environment-specific selection for hexane activity drove mutations that improved performance in hexane while compromising stability and aqueous catalytic function, as stated in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2108752"}]}
