The performance of prediction algorithms is often evaluated using the Q3 accuracy metric. This metric measures the percentage of residues correctly predicted across three conformational states: alpha-helix (H), beta-sheet (E), and coil (C). The Q3 accuracy is formally defined as the total number of correctly predicted residues divided by the total number of residues in the protein.\n\nConsider a simple, hypothetical prediction algorithm designed as a baseline for comparison. This algorithm naively assigns the 'coil' state to every single amino acid residue, regardless of the protein's sequence. Suppose this algorithm is used to predict the secondary structure of a particular protein that is known to have a true structural composition of 40% alpha-helix and 25% beta-sheet.

The peptide consists of a repeating sequence of (Gly-Pro-Hyp)$_{10}$, where Gly is Glycine, Pro is Proline, and Hyp is Hydroxyproline. They use a classic, first-generation secondary structure prediction tool based on the Chou-Fasman method. This method relies on assigning statistical propensities for each amino acid to be part of an alpha-helix ($P_{\\alpha}$) or a beta-sheet ($P_{\\beta}$). A residue is generally classified as a \"former\" for a given structure if its propensity is greater than 1.0, and a \"breaker\" if it is significantly less than 1.0.

Prediction: Alpha-helix. Reason: The algorithm identifies the repeating pattern and, despite the low individual propensities, classifies it as a stable helical form, failing to account for Proline's unique ring structure.\n\nB. Prediction: Beta-sheet. Reason: Glycine's propensity for a beta-sheet is the highest among the given options for the repeating unit, causing the algorithm to incorrectly favor this structure over others.\n\nC. Prediction: Random coil or turn. Reason: The algorithm's parameters are derived from statistical data of globular proteins where Glycine and Proline are canonical breakers of regular secondary structures; thus, it is not trained to recognize the specialized polyproline II helix formed by this sequence.\n\nD. Prediction: Polyproline II helix. Reason: The algorithm correctly recognizes that the high concentration of Proline is the defining feature for the formation of a polyproline II helix, demonstrating its specialized training for fibrous proteins.\n\nE. Prediction: Random coil or turn. Reason: The post-translational modification of Proline to Hydroxyproline introduces steric clashes that are known to destabilize any form of regular helix, leading the algorithm to correctly predict a disordered state.", "solution": "The sequence is a 30-residue chain given by the repeating unit $(\\text{Gly-Pro-Hyp})_{10}$. The Chou-Fasman approach classifies residues as formers of a secondary structure when their propensities exceed $1.0$, and as breakers when they are significantly less than $1.0$. For an $\\alpha$-helix prediction it seeks contiguous stretches where $P_{\\alpha} > 1.0$, and for a $\\beta$-sheet prediction it seeks contiguous stretches where $P_{\\beta} > 1.0$. Regions dominated by residues with propensities less than $1.0$ are typically assigned to random coil or turns.\n\nUsing the provided parameters, the residues in this sequence have the following propensities: for glycine, $P_{\\alpha}=0.57$ and $P_{\\beta}=0.75$; for proline, $P_{\\alpha}=0.57$ and $P_{\\beta}=0.55$; for hydroxyproline, $P_{\\alpha}=0.66$ and $P_{\\beta}=0.55$. Each of these values is less than $1.0$ for both $\\alpha$-helix and $\\beta$-sheet. Therefore, across the entire $(\\text{Gly-Pro-Hyp})_{10}$ sequence, there are no runs of residues that meet the Chou-Fasman threshold for forming an $\\alpha$-helix or a $\\beta$-sheet, and the sequence is enriched in residues (especially proline and glycine) historically treated as breakers of regular $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ structure within this framework. Consequently, the algorithm would most likely predict a random coil or turn-rich region rather than an $\\alpha$-helix or $\\beta$-sheet.\n\nExperimentally, a single collagen chain adopts a left-handed polyproline II helix prior to assembling into the collagen triple helix. The fundamental reason for the discrepancy is that the Chou-Fasman parameters were derived from datasets of globular proteins and are tuned to identify only $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, treating proline and glycine as breakers of these canonical structures. The method does not include recognition or scoring for the polyproline II helix characteristic of proline-rich, fibrous protein segments like collagen, and thus misclassifies such sequences as random coil or turns.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2135763"}]}
