The initial design, while catalytically active, exhibits poor thermal stability, limiting its practical application. A computational analysis of the protein's three-dimensional structure reveals a potential source of this instability: a glutamine residue (Gln) at position 112 is located deep within the hydrophobic core of the protein, as part of a central alpha-helix. To improve the enzyme's stability, the team decides to introduce a single-point mutation at this position. The goal is to replace Gln112 with an amino acid that will enhance the thermodynamic stability of the protein by optimizing the packing density and hydrophobicity of the core.\n\nBased on the principles of protein structure and stability, which of the following single-point mutations is most likely to achieve the desired stabilizing effect?\n\nA.

The guiding physical principles are:\n- Hydrophobic effect: Buried core positions favor nonpolar, hydrophobic side chains; burying polar or charged groups without compensating hydrogen bonds is destabilizing due to desolvation penalties and unsatisfied polar interactions.\n- Packing optimization: Side chains that pack efficiently with neighboring residues reduce internal cavities and increase van der Waals interactions, stabilizing the folded state.\n- Secondary structure propensity: For an alpha-helix, residues with high helix-forming propensity support backbone hydrogen bonding and helix integrity; helix breakers (e.g., proline) or residues increasing backbone flexibility (e.g., glycine) typically destabilize helices, especially at interior positions.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- Gln112Asp (Q112D): Asp is negatively charged under typical conditions. Burying a charged side chain in the hydrophobic core incurs a large desolvation cost unless neutralized by specific salt bridges or hydrogen bonds, which are not indicated here. This would generally decrease stability.\n- Gln112Gly (Q112G): Glycine increases conformational entropy of the backbone and has low alpha-helix propensity. In the middle of a helix, it tends to destabilize helical structure and does not contribute hydrophobic packing, thus unfavorable for core stability.\n- Gln112Leu (Q112L): Leucine is a hydrophobic, aliphatic side chain with high alpha-helix propensity and excellent packing characteristics (common in helical cores and leucine zippers). Replacing a buried polar glutamine with leucine increases hydrophobicity, improves packing, and supports helix stability, thus expected to increase thermodynamic stability.\n- Gln112Trp (Q112W): Tryptophan is hydrophobic but bulky and rigid. While it can stabilize some cores, its size may cause steric clashes or require structural rearrangements, potentially disrupting optimal packing in a tightly packed helix core. It is less reliably stabilizing than leucine in such contexts.\n- Gln112Pro (Q112P): Proline is a helix breaker in interior positions; it disrupts backbone hydrogen bonding and introduces kinks. Although it reduces unfolded-state entropy, in a central alpha-helix it typically destabilizes the structure.\n\nTherefore, the mutation most likely to optimize packing and hydrophobicity while preserving helical integrity is Gln112Leu.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2132656"}, {"introduction": "Rational protein design extends beyond creating static, stable structures to engineering dynamic, functional behavior. This exercise challenges you to design a protein that responds to a specific environmental cue—a change in pH—by introducing a charge-switching mechanism.

The primary contact point involves residue SER-95 on the Fab, which forms a hydrogen bond with residue GLN-182 in the binding pocket of Target V. However, preclinical testing shows that the Fab also binds to a human protein homolog, Protein H, which could lead to undesirable side effects.

Serine’s hydroxyl can act as both H-bond donor and acceptor with GLN’s side chain (amide carbonyl oxygen as acceptor, amide NH as donor).\n- Coulombic interactions between charges: The interaction energy between two point charges is\n$$\nE=\\frac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}\\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r} \\, ,\n$$\nso like charges yield $E>0$ (repulsive), opposite charges yield $E<0$ (attractive).

SER to GLY. Glycine removes the side chain hydroxyl, eliminating the specific H-bond to GLN-182. This would reduce binding to Target V and does not specifically disfavor interaction with ARG-182. It sacrifices affinity without adding specificity. Not suitable.\n\nB. SER to ASP. Aspartate introduces a negative charge. With GLN-182 (neutral), ASP could accept an H-bond from GLN’s amide NH, but no salt bridge forms. With ARG-182 (positively charged), ASP would form a favorable salt bridge: by Coulomb’s law, with $q_{1}=-1$ (ASP) and $q_{2}=+1$ (ARG), $E<0$ (attractive), which would increase off-target binding to Protein H—the opposite of the goal. Not suitable.\n\nC. SER to PHE. Phenylalanine is bulky and hydrophobic, removing the polar interaction. This would likely disrupt the H-bond with GLN-182 and reduce binding to Target V. It does not specifically penalize ARG-182 beyond loss of polarity and may create steric issues for both. Not suitable.\n\nD. SER to LYS. Lysine introduces a positively charged side chain that can still serve as a hydrogen bond donor (the terminal amine can donate to GLN’s carbonyl oxygen), preserving or potentially enhancing the interaction with GLN-182 via hydrogen bonding. With ARG-182, the interaction would now involve like charges (LYS $q\\approx+1$, ARG $q\\approx+1$), giving $E>0$ (repulsive) by Coulomb’s law, which disfavors binding to Protein H. This mutation thus maintains favorable interactions with Target V while introducing electrostatic repulsion to prevent binding to the human homolog.\n\nTherefore, the mutation most likely to preserve binding to GLN-182 and eliminate binding to ARG-182 is SER to LYS.\n\nHence, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2132706"}]}
