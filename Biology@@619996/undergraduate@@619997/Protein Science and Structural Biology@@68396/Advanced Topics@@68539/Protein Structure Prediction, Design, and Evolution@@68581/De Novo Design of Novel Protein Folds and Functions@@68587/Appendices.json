After computationally designing a sequence, the primary experimental test is to verify that the polypeptide folds into a stable, well-defined three-dimensional structure.

By interpreting the features of a ${}^{1}\\text{H}$-${}^{15}\\text{N}$ Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectrum, you will learn to distinguish a successfully folded protein from a disordered or aggregated one.", "problem": "A team of biochemists is engaged in *de novo* protein design, aiming to create a completely new protein fold. They have successfully synthesized a small, 60-residue polypeptide. To assess whether their design has successfully folded into a stable three-dimensional structure, they perform a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiment. Specifically, they record a two-dimensional ${}^{1}\\text{H}$-${}^{15}\\text{N}$ Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectrum of the protein dissolved in an aqueous buffer.\n\nThe resulting HSQC spectrum displays approximately 58 sharp, individual cross-peaks. Crucially, these peaks are \"well-dispersed,\" meaning they are spread out over a wide range of chemical shift values in both the proton (${}^{1}\\text{H}$, ~7.5-10.5 ppm) and nitrogen (${}^{15}\\text{N}$, ~105-130 ppm) dimensions.\n\nBased on this experimental observation, what is the most likely conclusion about the structural state of the newly designed protein?\n\nA. The protein is largely unfolded and exists as a flexible random coil, where most residues are exposed to the solvent.\n\nB. The protein has formed large, insoluble aggregates, leading to a loss of signal for most of the residues.\n\nC. The protein has successfully folded into a single, stable, and well-defined three-dimensional tertiary structure.\n\nD. The protein is highly dynamic, rapidly fluctuating between multiple different unfolded states.\n\nE. The protein is composed entirely of alpha-helices, as indicated by the number of peaks observed.", "solution": "An ${}^{1}\\text{H}$-${}^{15}\\text{N}$ HSQC spectrum reports one backbone amide cross-peak per non-proline residue (plus side-chain amide signals for residues like asparagine and glutamine), provided the amide is not exchanging too rapidly with solvent. For a 60-residue protein, the expected number of backbone amide peaks is close to the number of non-proline residues, typically slightly fewer than the total residue count due to prolines (which lack backbone amide protons) and possible exchange-broadened or unobserved termini.\n\nObservation 1: Approximately 58 sharp, individual cross-peaks are present. This number is consistent with a small monomeric protein where nearly all amide groups are observed. The sharpness of peaks indicates relatively fast overall tumbling (short rotational correlation time), which is characteristic of small, soluble, non-aggregated species. Large aggregates would have slow tumbling and lead to extensive line broadening and loss of many peaks, contradicting the observation.\n\nObservation 2: The peaks are well-dispersed over a wide range in the ${}^{1}\\text{H}$ dimension (approximately $7.5$ to $10.5$ ppm) and the ${}^{15}\\text{N}$ dimension (approximately $105$ to $130$ ppm). Chemical shift dispersion in the amide ${}^{1}\\text{H}$ dimension is a hallmark of a structured protein with a well-defined tertiary fold, as different residues experience distinct local magnetic environments due to stable secondary and tertiary structure. In contrast, an unfolded or random coil polypeptide shows poor dispersion, with amide ${}^{1}\\text{H}$ shifts clustering near approximately $8.0$ to $8.5$ ppm. Highly dynamic exchange among multiple unfolded states would also produce averaging and/or exchange broadening rather than a full set of sharp, well-dispersed peaks.\n\nInference: The near-complete count of expected amide peaks, their sharpness, and strong chemical shift dispersion collectively indicate that the protein exists predominantly as a single, folded conformational state with a well-defined tertiary structure. The data do not specify the exact secondary structure composition (for example, the fraction of alpha-helix versus beta-sheet) and therefore cannot justify a claim that it is entirely alpha-helical. The observations also directly contradict scenarios of extensive aggregation, predominant disorder, or rapid interconversion among multiple unfolded states.\n\nTherefore, the most likely conclusion is that the designed protein has successfully folded into a single, stable, and well-defined three-dimensional tertiary structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2107601"}, {"introduction": "Confirming that a protein folds is only the beginning; understanding its stability and the nature of its folding process is equally critical for robust design.

You will apply a thermodynamic formula to quantify the folding cooperativity, measured by the van't Hoff enthalpy ($\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}}$), connecting an experimental measurement to the abstract but powerful concept of the protein's folding energy landscape.", "problem": "A team of bioengineers has performed a *de novo* computational design of a small, 85-residue protein, named \"Artichorin,\" intended to function as a scaffold for a new type of biosensor. To characterize its folding and stability, the team conducted a thermal denaturation experiment monitored by Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The molar ellipticity at 222 nm, $[\\theta]_{222}$, was used to track the loss of alpha-helical secondary structure as a function of temperature.\n\nThe experiment revealed a fully reversible thermal transition with the following characteristics:\n- The melting temperature, $T_m$, defined as the temperature at which the protein is 50% unfolded, was found to be $60.0\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.\n- The transition from the folded state to the unfolded state was notably broad, spanning a wide temperature range.\n- The slope of the fraction of unfolded protein, $f_U$, with respect to temperature, $T$, evaluated at the melting temperature, $(\\frac{d f_U}{dT})_{T=T_m}$, was determined to be $0.0200 \\text{ K}^{-1}$.\n\nThe cooperativity of a two-state folding transition can be quantified by the van't Hoff enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}}$, which is related to the steepness of the denaturation curve at $T_m$ by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = 4 R T_m^2 \\left( \\frac{d f_U}{dT} \\right)_{T=T_m} $$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $R = 8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$, and $T_m$ is in Kelvin.

Artichorin exhibits highly cooperative, two-state folding, characteristic of a smooth folding energy landscape. Its van't Hoff enthalpy is approximately $370 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\n\nB. The broad transition indicates that Artichorin is irreversibly aggregating upon heating, a common failure mode for designed proteins, which invalidates the concept of a folding energy landscape.\n\nC. Artichorin displays low folding cooperativity, suggesting a rugged folding energy landscape with significantly populated intermediate states. Its van't Hoff enthalpy is approximately $74 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\n\nD. The CD data suggests that Artichorin lacks a stable folded structure even at low temperatures and exists as a random coil across the entire temperature range. The calculated van't Hoff enthalpy is thus physically meaningless.\n\nE. Artichorin shows high thermodynamic stability due to its broad melting transition. This is consistent with a highly cooperative folding mechanism and a van't Hoff enthalpy of approximately $150 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.", "solution": "The goal is to interpret the provided experimental data for the designed protein Artichorin and select the most accurate description of its folding properties from the given options. This involves both a qualitative interpretation of the broad denaturation curve and a quantitative calculation of the van't Hoff enthalpy.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the qualitative information. The problem states that the thermal denaturation transition is \"notably broad.\" In protein folding, the sharpness of the melting curve is a direct measure of the cooperativity of the unfolding transition. A sharp, sigmoidal curve indicates high cooperativity, where the protein molecule transitions from a predominantly folded state to a predominantly unfolded state over a narrow temperature range. This is often described as an \"all-or-none\" or two-state transition (Folded $\\rightleftharpoons$ Unfolded). Conversely, a broad transition indicates low cooperativity. This suggests that the unfolding process is not a simple two-state event. Instead, there are likely one or more thermodynamically stable intermediate states that become populated as the temperature increases. This corresponds to a \"rugged\" folding energy landscape, where, in addition to the global minimum of the native state, there are other local minima corresponding to these intermediate states.\n\nSecond, let's perform the quantitative analysis by calculating the van't Hoff enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}}$, which quantifies the cooperativity. The formula is given as:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = 4 R T_m^2 \\left( \\frac{d f_U}{dT} \\right)_{T=T_m} $$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Ideal gas constant, $R = 8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$.\n- Melting temperature, $T_m = 60.0 \\text{ °C}$. We must convert this to Kelvin: $T_m(\\text{K}) = 60.0 + 273.15 = 333.15 \\text{ K}$.\n- Slope of the fraction unfolded at $T_m$, $(\\frac{d f_U}{dT})_{T=T_m} = 0.0200 \\text{ K}^{-1}$. The small value of this slope is the mathematical representation of the \"broad\" transition.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = 4 \\times (8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (333.15 \\text{ K})^2 \\times (0.0200 \\text{ K}^{-1}) $$\nFirst, calculate the square of the temperature:\n$$ (333.15 \\text{ K})^2 = 110989.2225 \\text{ K}^2 $$\nNow, multiply all the terms:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = 4 \\times 8.314 \\times 110989.2225 \\times 0.0200 \\text{ J/mol} $$\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = 73824.9 \\text{ J/mol} $$\nTo compare this with the typical range given in the problem (200-500 kJ/mol), we convert our result to kJ/mol:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = \\frac{73824.9}{1000} \\text{ kJ/mol} \\approx 73.8 \\text{ kJ/mol} $$\nThis calculated value is significantly lower than the typical range for cooperatively folding proteins, which quantitatively confirms the interpretation of low cooperativity.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the given options:\n- **A:** Claims high cooperativity and calculates $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} \\approx 370 \\text{ kJ/mol}$. This is incorrect. The broad curve indicates low cooperativity, and our calculation confirms a low $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}}$.\n- **B:** Suggests irreversible aggregation. The problem explicitly states the transition was \"fully reversible,\" so this option is incorrect.\n- **C:** Claims low folding cooperativity, a rugged energy landscape with intermediates, and calculates $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} \\approx 74 \\text{ kJ/mol}$. This matches both our qualitative interpretation and our quantitative calculation.\n- **D:** Claims the protein lacks a stable folded structure. This contradicts the CD experiment, which shows a transition from a structured state (implied by monitoring ellipticity at 222 nm, which tracks alpha-helices) to an unfolded state. A transition would not be observed if the protein were always a random coil.\n- **E:** Confuses a broad transition with high thermodynamic stability and incorrectly suggests high cooperativity. A broad transition means low cooperativity. The calculation of $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} \\approx 150 \\text{ kJ/mol}$ is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2107610"}, {"introduction": "The pinnacle of *de novo* design is not just creating novel folds, but engineering novel functions, such as the highly specific recognition of a target molecule.

Consider the task of designing a novel protein that serves as a specific sensor for Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) but does not bind its precursor, Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP). The sole structural difference between these molecules is that ATP possesses a terminal (gamma) phosphate group which is absent in ADP.\n\nThe design process utilizes two core principles:\n1.  **Positive Design**: Engineering stabilizing interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, salt bridges) between the protein and the desired target ligand (ATP) to achieve high affinity.\n2.  **Negative Design**: Engineering destabilizing interactions (e.g., steric clashes, electrostatic repulsion) that specifically penalize the binding of undesired, competing ligands (ADP).\n\nAn effective strategy must integrate both principles. Which of the following proposed design strategies for the protein's binding pocket is most likely to achieve high affinity for ATP and high specificity against ADP?\n\nA. Maximize the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors and positive charges (e.g., Lysine, Arginine) throughout the binding pocket to create an extremely high overall affinity for the phosphate groups present in ATP.\n\nB. Introduce several negatively charged residues (e.g., Aspartate, Glutamate) into the binding pocket, positioned to create a general electrostatic repulsion field against the negatively charged phosphate backbone of any nucleotide, but engineer a single, highly specific pocket for the adenine base.\n\nC. Position a positively charged residue (e.g., Arginine) to form a salt bridge specifically with the gamma-phosphate of ATP. Simultaneously, place a negatively charged residue (e.g., Aspartate) nearby such that it forms a stabilizing intra-protein salt bridge with the Arginine when ATP is bound, but would be forced into close, repulsive proximity with the beta-phosphate of ADP if ADP were to bind.\n\nD. Engineer a deep, rigid pocket that perfectly fits the adenosine and ribose moieties. For the phosphate-binding region, introduce a large, non-polar residue (e.g., Tryptophan) that would sterically occupy the space where the gamma-phosphate of ATP would bind, thereby preventing ATP binding but allowing ADP to fit.\n\nE.
