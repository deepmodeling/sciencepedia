The team wants to understand its function, and a key step is to determine its three-dimensional structure. Experimental methods for structure determination are currently proving difficult and time-consuming.\n\nAs a computational biologist on the team, you perform a sequence similarity search against the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository of known protein structures. The search reveals that Ventherin's amino acid sequence shares a maximum of 25% sequence identity with any protein of known structure. This level of identity is often described as being in the \"twilight zone\" for sequence-based comparisons, where evolutionary relationships are ambiguous.\n\nGiven this low but non-zero sequence identity to a potential template, which of the following classical computational structure prediction methods would be the most rational and effective strategy to try *first* to generate a structural model of Ventherin?\n\nA.

The given maximum identity is $25\\%$, which is commonly considered the “twilight zone,” where direct sequence-based evolutionary relationships are ambiguous and alignment errors become frequent if one attempts standard homology modeling without additional evidence.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- Ab Initio Folding (A): This is typically used when no detectable template can be identified. It is computationally intensive and less reliable for larger proteins. Given there is detectable but weak similarity, ab initio is not the first choice.\n- Homology Modeling (B): This method relies on a trustworthy sequence alignment to a template; it performs best when identity is at least roughly above $30\\%$ to $40\\%$. At $25\\%$, the risk of alignment errors and inaccurate models is high, making it a less rational first step without additional fold evidence.\n- X-ray Crystallography (C): This is an experimental technique, not a computational method, and so it does not answer the computational strategy question.\n- Protein Threading (Fold Recognition) (D): This approach is explicitly designed to handle low-identity cases by aligning the query sequence to a library of folds using structural profiles, predicted secondary structure, and environment/packing potentials. It is the standard classical computational choice to identify remote homologs or compatible folds in the twilight zone and to generate an initial model that can later be refined.\n\nTherefore, the most rational and effective computational method to try first, given $25\\%$ identity, is protein threading (fold recognition).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2104531"}, {"introduction": "In template-based methods like homology modeling, the sequence alignment is the blueprint upon which the entire structural model is built.

Before proceeding with more complex analyses like molecular dynamics simulations, the student performs an initial quality assessment by checking the fundamental geometric properties of the polypeptide chains in both models.\n\nIn protein structures, the polypeptide backbone's conformation is largely described by three repeating dihedral angles for each amino acid residue: phi ($\\phi$) which involves the N-C$_\\alpha$ bond, psi ($\\psi$) which involves the C$_\\alpha$-C bond, and omega ($\\omega$) which involves the peptide bond (C-N).\n\nWhen inspecting a region of the protein model that does not involve a proline residue, which of the following observations would represent the most definitive and severe indicator of a non-physical artifact or error in the model's geometry?\n\nA.

Consequently, $\\omega$ is overwhelmingly near either $180^{\\circ}$ (trans) or $0^{\\circ}$ (cis), with only small deviations due to slight pyramidalization. A value of $\\omega = 85^{\\circ}$ implies a grossly non-planar peptide bond far from either trans or cis, which is non-physical for a properly modeled peptide backbone (particularly in a region not involving proline, where even the rare cis state would be near $0^{\\circ}$, not $85^{\\circ}$). This is a definitive and severe indicator of an artifact.\n\n2) The backbone dihedrals $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are constrained by steric exclusion mapped by the Ramachandran plot, but they are not rigidly fixed. For non-glycine residues, positive $\\phi$ values (e.g., $\\phi = +110^{\\circ}$) are highly disfavored and typically flagged as outliers; however, they are not strictly impossible and can be observed in rare, strained conformations or special contexts. Thus, option A, while suspicious, is not as definitive as a non-planar peptide bond.\n\n3) A value of $\\psi = +175^{\\circ}$ (option B) is compatible with an extended backbone conformation and is common in beta-like regions; it is not indicative of an error.\n\n4) A backbone carbonyl O to amide H distance of $3.6$ angstroms (option D) is longer than typical strong hydrogen bonds (often under roughly $3.2$ angstroms), but it is still physically plausible as a weak or non-bonded contact. It does not by itself indicate a non-physical geometry.\n\n5) A rare but clash-free side-chain $\\chi_1$ rotamer (option E), even if observed in less than 1% of high-resolution structures, can still be physically valid; rarity alone is not evidence of a modeling artifact if sterics and bonding are reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the most definitive and severe indicator of a non-physical artifact is an $\\omega$ angle near $85^{\\circ}$, reflecting a non-planar peptide bond.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2104510"}]}
