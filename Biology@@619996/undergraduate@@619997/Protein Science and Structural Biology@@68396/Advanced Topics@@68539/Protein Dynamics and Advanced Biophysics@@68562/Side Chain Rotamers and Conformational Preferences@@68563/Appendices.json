The lysine side chain is a linear chain of four methylene groups followed by an amino group. The structure, starting from the alpha-carbon (C$\\alpha$), is:\n-C$\\alpha$ -- C$\\beta$H$_2$ -- C$\\gamma$H$_2$ -- C$\\delta$H$_2$ -- C$\\epsilon$H$_2$ -- N$\\zeta$H$_3^+$\n\nA $\\chi$ angle corresponds to a rotation around a single bond connecting two non-hydrogen atoms in the side chain. We can identify these bonds sequentially starting from the C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$ bond:\n1.  The C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$ bond. Rotation around this bond is defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_1$ (atoms N-C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$).\n2.  The C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$ bond. Rotation around this bond is defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_2$ (atoms C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$-C$\\delta$).\n3.  The C$\\gamma$-C$\\delta$ bond. Rotation around this bond is defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_3$ (atoms C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$-C$\\delta$-C$\\epsilon$).\n4.  The C$\\delta$-C$\\epsilon$ bond. Rotation around this bond is defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_4$ (atoms C$\\gamma$-C$\\delta$-C$\\epsilon$-N$\\zeta$).\n\nThe final bond is C$\\epsilon$-N$\\zeta$. While there is rotation around this bond, the standard definition of $\\chi$ angles for lysine typically includes the four rotations within its carbon-chain framework. Thus, the lysine side chain has 4 definable $\\chi$ angles.\n\nNext, let's analyze the side chain of tryptophan. The tryptophan side chain consists of a methylene group attached to an indole ring. The structure, starting from the C$\\alpha$, is:\n-C$\\alpha$ -- C$\\beta$H$_2$ -- C$\\gamma$ -- (Indole Ring)\n\nWe identify the rotatable single bonds between heavy atoms:\n1.  The C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$ bond. Rotation around this bond is defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_1$ (atoms N-C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$).\n2.  The C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$ bond. Rotation around this bond is defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_2$ (atoms C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$-C$\\delta_1$). This rotation changes the orientation of the entire indole ring relative to the backbone.\n\nThe indole ring itself is a rigid, planar aromatic system. The bonds within the ring are part of a conjugated system and are not freely rotatable. Therefore, there are no further $\\chi$ angles within the indole group. Thus, the tryptophan side chain has 2 definable $\\chi$ angles.\n\nFinally, we compare the number of $\\chi$ angles for each side chain.\nNumber of $\\chi$ angles for lysine = 4.\nNumber of $\\chi$ angles for tryptophan = 2.\n\nThe difference is $4 - 2 = 2$.\nTherefore, lysine has 2 more $\\chi$ angles than tryptophan.

For an L-amino acid, when viewed from $C_{\\alpha}$ to $C_{\\beta}$, these groups are arranged in a clockwise order: N, C', H$_{\\alpha}$. We can set up a reference Newman projection by placing the main-chain Nitrogen (N) at the 12 o'clock position. Given the clockwise arrangement, the Carbonyl Carbon (C') would be at the 4 o'clock position, and the alpha-hydrogen (H$_{\\alpha}$) at the 8 o'clock position.\n\nThe back carbon is $C_{\\beta}$. Its substituents are H$_{\\beta}$, $C_{\\gamma1}$, and $C_{\\gamma2}$.

A positive dihedral angle corresponds to a clockwise rotation of the substituent on the back carbon ($C_{\\gamma1}$) relative to the substituent on the front carbon (N).\n\nStarting with N at the 12 o'clock position, a +60° rotation places $C_{\\gamma1}$ at the 2 o'clock position.\nNow we can analyze the relationship of $C_{\\gamma1}$ to the substituents on the front carbon:\n-   The angle between $C_{\\gamma1}$ (at 2 o'clock) and N (at 12 o'clock) is 60°.

In our projection, this would place $C_{\\gamma1}$ at the 6 o'clock position. This is not the most favorable conformation.\n\nC. \"The $C_{\\gamma1}$ carbon is positioned such that it is gauche to both the main-chain Nitrogen and the alpha-hydrogen.\" For $C_{\\gamma1}$ to be gauche to N (12 o'clock) and H$_{\\alpha}$ (8 o'clock), it would need to be at the 10 o'clock position. This corresponds to the gauche-minus ($g^-$) rotamer, where $\\chi_1 \\approx -60^{\\circ}$.

By systematically building a mental model of a leucine side chain, you will learn to pinpoint the specific atomic interactions, such as steric clashes, that make certain rotameric states energetically unfavorable.", "problem": "### Problem Statement\n\nThe three-dimensional structure of a protein is largely determined by the energetically favorable conformations of its amino acid side chains, known as rotamers. These rotameric preferences arise from the need to minimize steric hindrance. For the amino acid Leucine, the side-chain conformation is primarily described by two dihedral angles: $\\chi_1$, defined by the atoms N-C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$, and $\\chi_2$, defined by the atoms C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$-C$\\delta$1. The two methyl groups attached to C$\\gamma$ are designated C$\\delta$1 and C$\\delta$2.\n\nConsider a Leucine residue within a polypeptide chain that adopts a specific rotameric state where $\\chi_1 = 180^{\\circ}$ and $\\chi_2 = -60^{\\circ}$. This state is sometimes referred to as the *trans, gauche-minus* ($t, g^-$) rotamer.

The C$\\delta$1 group.\n\nB. The C$\\delta$2 group.\n\nC. Both groups are equally hindered.\n\nD. Neither group is significantly hindered in this conformation.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must determine the three-dimensional arrangement of the Leucine side chain for the specified rotamer ($\\chi_1 = 180^{\\circ}$, $\\chi_2 = -60^{\\circ}$) and identify any resulting steric clashes with the backbone of the same residue. A steric clash typically occurs between atoms separated by four single bonds (a 1,5-interaction) that are forced into close proximity.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the conformation around the C$_{\\alpha}$-C$_{\\beta}$ bond ($\\chi_1 = 180^{\\circ}$).**\n\nThe dihedral angle $\\chi_1$ is defined by the atoms N-$C_{\\alpha}$-$C_{\\beta}$-$C_{\\gamma}$. A value of $180^{\\circ}$ means that the $C_{\\gamma}$ atom is *anti-periplanar* to the backbone nitrogen atom (N). Let's visualize this with a Newman projection looking down the $C_{\\alpha}$-$C_{\\beta}$ bond:\n- The front atom is $C_{\\alpha}$, with its substituents: N, the carbonyl carbon ($C'$), and $H_{\\alpha}$.\n- The back atom is $C_{\\beta}$, with its substituents: $C_{\\gamma}$, and two beta-hydrogens.\n- Since $\\chi_1 = 180^{\\circ}$, $C_{\\gamma}$ on the back carbon is positioned directly opposite N on the front carbon. This is the *trans* ($t$) rotamer.\n- In this arrangement, $C_{\\gamma}$ is *gauche* (dihedral angle of approximately $\\pm 60^{\\circ}$) to both the carbonyl carbon $C'$ and the alpha-hydrogen $H_{\\alpha}$. This means the rest of the side chain, starting from $C_{\\gamma}$, is pointed towards the $C'$/$H_{\\alpha}$ side of the backbone, not the N side.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the conformation around the C$_{\\beta}$-C$_{\\gamma}$ bond ($\\chi_2 = -60^{\\circ}$).**\n\nThe dihedral angle $\\chi_2$ is defined by the atoms $C_{\\alpha}$-$C_{\\beta}$-$C_{\\gamma}$-$C_{\\delta1}$. A value of $-60^{\\circ}$ means that the $C_{\\delta1}$ atom is in a *gauche-minus* ($g^-$) conformation relative to the $C_{\\alpha}$ atom. This indicates that the side chain \"folds back\" on itself.\nLet's trace the key atomic chain that could lead to a clash. The potential clash is between a delta-carbon ($C_{\\delta1}$ or $C_{\\delta2}$) and a backbone atom (N, $C'$, or O). The atoms involved would be separated by four bonds, for example: $C'$—$C_{\\alpha}$—$C_{\\beta}$—$C_{\\gamma}$—$C_{\\delta1}$.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the spatial information to identify the steric clash.**\n\nLet's combine the effects of both dihedral angles:\n1.  **Effect of $\\chi_1 = 180^{\\circ}$:** As established, this orients the side chain away from the backbone N atom and towards the backbone $C'$ atom. The dihedral angle for the chain $C'-C_{\\alpha}-C_{\\beta}-C_{\\gamma}$ is approximately $-60^{\\circ}$.\n2.  **Effect of $\\chi_2 = -60^{\\circ}$:** This orients $C_{\\delta1}$ relative to $C_{\\alpha}$. The dihedral angle for the chain $C_{\\alpha}-C_{\\beta}-C_{\\gamma}-C_{\\delta1}$ is $-60^{\\circ}$ by definition.\n\nThe combination of these two *gauche* relationships in the atomic chain $C'-C_{\\alpha}-C_{\\beta}-C_{\\gamma}-C_{\\delta1}$ forces the two terminal atoms—the backbone carbonyl carbon $C'$ and the side-chain methyl carbon $C_{\\delta1}$—into close proximity. This creates a classic steric clash known as a pentane interference or $\\gamma$-gauche effect.\n\nWhat about $C_{\\delta2}$? For leucine, the $C_{\\delta2}$ methyl group is staggered relative to $C_{\\delta1}$. It will be located at a dihedral angle ($\\chi_2$-like) of approximately $180^{\\circ}$ relative to $C_{\\alpha}$. This places $C_{\\delta2}$ in an extended, anti-conformation ($C_{\\alpha}-C_{\\beta}-C_{\\gamma}-C_{\\delta2}$) which points away from the backbone, thus avoiding any significant steric clash.\n\nTherefore, in the ($\\chi_1=180^\\circ, \\chi_2=-60^\\circ$) rotamer, the $C_{\\delta1}$ methyl group is the one that experiences a significant steric clash with the backbone, specifically with the carbonyl carbon atom ($C'$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2137279"}]}
