{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A primary challenge in cellular cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is the thickness of eukaryotic cells, which are generally opaque to the electron beam. To visualize structures deep within a cell, we must first create an ultra-thin, electron-transparent window without destroying the native cellular architecture preserved by vitrification. This exercise [@problem_id:2114735] explores the crucial role of focused ion beam (FIB) milling, a nanoscale sculpting technique that has become indispensable for preparing cellular samples for high-resolution in situ imaging.", "problem": "A team of structural biologists is investigating a novel protein complex called the \"Cytoskeletal Organizing Nexus\" (CON) that resides deep within the cytoplasm of a specialized mammalian neuron. To visualize the CON in its native cellular environment at high resolution, the team decides to employ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). The initial step involves growing the neurons on a specialized grid and then rapidly freezing them in a process that creates a glass-like, non-crystalline state of ice, preserving the cellular structures. However, a typical neuron cell body is approximately 15 micrometers thick, which is far too thick for the 300 keV electron beam of a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) to penetrate.\n\nTo overcome this thickness limitation, the vitrified cells are transferred into a dual-beam instrument that integrates a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). After identifying a neuron containing the CON, a procedure involving the FIB is performed before the sample is moved to the TEM for tomographic data acquisition.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the primary role of the Focused Ion Beam (FIB) in this specific cryo-ET workflow?\n\nA. The FIB is used to deposit a conductive platinum layer over the cell surface to prevent charging effects during the final imaging in the TEM.\n\nB. The FIB generates the final high-resolution 3D tomogram by scanning the sample with a beam of heavy ions and recording their transmission pattern.\n\nC. The FIB is used to sublimate the amorphous ice surrounding the cell, exposing the underlying cellular plasma membrane for easier targeting.\n\nD. The FIB ablates material from the top and bottom surfaces of the frozen cell, carving out a thin, electron-transparent window (a \"lamella\") centered on the CON.\n\nE. The FIB delivers a dose of low-energy ions to the cell, which acts as a chemical fixative to cross-link proteins and stabilize the cellular architecture before imaging.", "solution": "The central challenge in performing cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) on whole eukaryotic cells is their thickness. The electron beam in a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) has limited penetrating power. For high-resolution imaging, the sample thickness must typically be less than 300 nanometers. Since a mammalian cell is on the order of tens of micrometers thick, it is opaque to the electron beam. Therefore, a method is needed to create a thin, observable section of the cell while maintaining its vitrified, near-native state. This is the specific problem that cryo-Focused Ion Beam (cryo-FIB) milling addresses.\n\nLet's analyze the steps and evaluate each option:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The sample is a whole, vitrified (frozen in non-crystalline ice) cell on an EM grid. It is too thick for TEM.\n\n2.  **The Role of the dual-beam FIB-SEM**: The instrument combines two beams. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) beam (electrons) is used to image the surface of the frozen cell at low magnification to locate the cell and the general region of interest (e.g., the cytoplasm where the CON is located). The Focused Ion Beam (FIB) (heavy ions, e.g., Gallium) is used as a nanoscale sculpting tool.\n\n3.  **The Milling Process**: The high-energy ion beam is directed at the sample to sputter, or mill away, material. To create an electron-transparent window, the FIB is used to remove a large amount of material from in front of and behind the target region. This process is performed in sequential steps, creating two parallel trenches that define a thin, vertical slab of the cell. This slab is called a \"lamella\". This lamella, typically 100-250 nm thick, is thin enough for the TEM's electron beam to pass through. The process is monitored with the SEM to ensure the lamella is of the correct thickness and contains the cellular feature of interest (the CON).\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on this understanding:\n\n*   **A. The FIB is used to deposit a conductive platinum layer over the cell surface to prevent charging effects during the final imaging in the TEM.**\n    This is incorrect. While a platinum layer is often deposited using a gas injection system within the FIB-SEM, its purpose is to protect the surface of the lamella from the ion beam itself during milling and to reduce curtaining artifacts. It is not for preventing charging in the final TEM imaging, and it is a supportive step, not the *primary role* of the FIB, which is material removal.\n\n*   **B. The FIB generates the final high-resolution 3D tomogram by scanning the sample with a beam of heavy ions and recording their transmission pattern.**\n    This is incorrect. The final tomogram is generated in a separate instrument, the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), which uses an *electron* beam, not an ion beam. Using the high-energy ion beam for imaging would rapidly destroy the delicate, frozen biological sample.\n\n*   **C. The FIB is used to sublimate the amorphous ice surrounding the cell, exposing the underlying cellular plasma membrane for easier targeting.**\n    This is incorrect. The FIB is a sputtering process, not a gentle sublimation process. It removes all material in its path, including the ice and the cell itself. Its goal is to go *through* the cell, not just expose its surface.\n\n*   **D. The FIB ablates material from the top and bottom surfaces of the frozen cell, carving out a thin, electron-transparent window (a \"lamella\") centered on the CON.**\n    This is the correct description. The primary and essential function of the FIB is to act as a nanoscale scalpel to physically remove material and create a thin section (lamella) suitable for TEM analysis, precisely at the location of the target structure within the much-thicker cell.\n\n*   **E. The FIB delivers a dose of low-energy ions to the cell, which acts as a chemical fixative to cross-link proteins and stabilize the cellular architecture before imaging.**\n    This is incorrect. The sample is physically preserved by vitrification (rapid freezing), not by chemical fixation. The high-energy ion beam is destructive and is used for material removal (ablation), not for gentle chemical modification. Any interaction with the sample is fundamentally a physical sputtering process.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that accurately describes the primary and critical role of the FIB in the cryo-ET workflow is the creation of a thin lamella by milling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2114735"}, {"introduction": "While FIB milling makes in situ structural analysis possible, working within the crowded and dynamic cellular environment introduces unique challenges that can limit the final resolution. In this problem [@problem_id:2114695], we will quantitatively explore why a structure determined *in situ* might be of lower resolution than one determined from purified proteins *in vitro*. By treating different sources of error as independent factors, you can calculate their combined effect and appreciate the trade-offs between seeing a protein in its native context and achieving the highest possible structural detail.", "problem": "A structural biology team is investigating a large, multi-subunit protein complex using Cellular Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET), a technique that produces three-dimensional reconstructions of cellular landscapes. They employ two distinct experimental strategies to determine the structure of the complex via a process called subtomogram averaging.\n\n**Strategy 1 (In Vitro):** The protein complex is biochemically purified from cells and prepared on an imaging grid in a thin layer of vitrified ice. The primary limitation on the final structural resolution is the precision of the computational algorithms used to determine the orientation of each individual complex. This process is characterized by an angular alignment uncertainty, which can be modeled as a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of $\\sigma_{vitro} = 0.75$ degrees.\n\n**Strategy 2 (In Situ):** The protein complex is imaged directly within its native environment inside a cell. This approach introduces two independent sources of angular uncertainty that degrade the final resolution. First, the crowded and noisy cellular environment reduces the signal-to-noise ratio of each particle, leading to a less precise computational alignment characterized by a standard deviation of $\\sigma_{align} = 1.10$ degrees. Second, the complex is not perfectly rigid and static within the cell; it exhibits minor random orientational fluctuations, or \"wobble,\" due to thermal energy and transient interactions with neighboring macromolecules. This physical heterogeneity contributes an additional, independent angular uncertainty with a standard deviation of $\\sigma_{wobble} = 1.40$ degrees.\n\nAssume a simplified physical model where the achievable resolution, $d$, of the final averaged structure is directly proportional to the total angular uncertainty in orientation assignment, $\\sigma_{total}$. A higher value for $d$ corresponds to a lower-resolution (more blurry) structure.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the ratio of the best possible resolution achievable *in situ* to the best possible resolution achievable *in vitro*, i.e., the value of $d_{in\\_situ} / d_{vitro}$. Report your answer as a dimensionless number rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The final resolution is proportional to the total angular uncertainty, so with $d \\propto \\sigma_{\\text{total}}$, the ratio of resolutions equals the ratio of total angular uncertainties:\n$$\n\\frac{d_{\\mathrm{in\\ situ}}}{d_{\\mathrm{vitro}}}=\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{in\\ situ}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{vitro}}}.\n$$\nIndependent Gaussian angular uncertainties add in quadrature (variances add), so for in situ imaging with independent alignment and wobble contributions,\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{in\\ situ}}=\\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{align}}^{2}+\\sigma_{\\mathrm{wobble}}^{2}}=\\sqrt{1.10^{2}+1.40^{2}}=\\sqrt{1.21+1.96}=\\sqrt{3.17}\\approx 1.78045.\n$$\nFor the in vitro strategy, the total uncertainty is the given alignment uncertainty,\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{vitro}}=0.75.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\frac{d_{\\mathrm{in\\ situ}}}{d_{\\mathrm{vitro}}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{3.17}}{0.75}\\approx \\frac{1.78045}{0.75}\\approx 2.37393,\n$$\nwhich, rounded to three significant figures, is $2.37$. The ratio is dimensionless because the same angular units cancel.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.37}$$", "id": "2114695"}, {"introduction": "Sometimes, a lower-resolution result from cryo-ET is not a technical limitation but a clue to the protein's biological function. In subtomogram averaging, combining images of structurally different or moving particles results in a \"blurry\" map. This is where the synergy of cryo-ET and in-cell NMR becomes powerful, as demonstrated in this problem [@problem_id:2114679]. By analyzing complementary data from both techniques, you can learn to distinguish between technical artifacts and true conformational dynamics, revealing how proteins move and function inside a living cell.", "problem": "A research team is studying a newly discovered protein, the \"FlexiSynthase\" complex, which is crucial for nutrient processing in a specific bacterial species. To understand its mechanism, they employ two advanced structural biology techniques to study the protein directly inside the bacterial cells.\n\nFirst, they use cellular cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), a technique that provides 3D images of the cell's interior in a near-native, frozen-hydrated state. They identify numerous copies of the FlexiSynthase complex within these cellular snapshots. To obtain a high-resolution structure, they apply a computational method called subtomogram averaging, which involves extracting and averaging thousands of these individual complex images. However, the resulting 3D reconstruction is poorly resolved and appears \"blurry,\" preventing the determination of a detailed atomic model.\n\nSecond, they use in-cell Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a technique that probes the structure and dynamics of proteins at an atomic level within the living cell. The NMR spectrum of FlexiSynthase shows a single set of resonance peaks for the entire protein population. These peaks are notably broader than what would be expected for a static protein of its size but become sharper upon data processing.\n\nGiven these two distinct experimental outcomes—a blurry map from cryo-ET subtomogram averaging and a single set of broadened peaks from in-cell NMR—what is the most likely biophysical state of the FlexiSynthase complex inside the cell?\n\nA. The protein is largely unfolded and non-functional within the cellular environment.\n\nB. The protein population exists as a stable, static mixture of two distinct conformations (e.g., 50% \"open\" and 50% \"closed\") that do not interconvert.\n\nC. The protein is rapidly exchanging between two or more distinct conformations on a microsecond-to-millisecond timescale.\n\nD. The protein exists in a single, rigid, well-defined conformation, and the blurriness in the cryo-ET map is purely a result of technical artifacts like sample thickness or poor image alignment.\n\nE. All copies of the protein are aggregating into large, insoluble clumps, which prevents structural determination by either method.", "solution": "- Identify the core observation from cryo-ET subtomogram averaging: averaging many copies yields a blurry 3D map. In subtomogram averaging, the recovered density is a population average,\n$$ \\rho_{\\text{avg}}(\\mathbf{r})=\\sum_{i}p_{i}\\rho_{i}(\\mathbf{r}), $$\nwhere $p_{i}$ are the state populations and $\\rho_{i}(\\mathbf{r})$ are the state-specific densities. If multiple conformations are present and not perfectly separated by classification, or if conformations interconvert during data acquisition, then $\\rho_{i}$ differ and their sum produces smeared features (loss of high-resolution detail), consistent with conformational heterogeneity and dynamics rather than a single rigid structure.\n\n- Interpret the in-cell NMR observation: a single set of resonances for the entire protein population implies that all molecules are indistinguishable on the NMR timescale, i.e., they are in fast or intermediate exchange among conformations. In fast exchange, observed resonances are population-weighted averages,\n$$ \\omega_{\\text{obs}}=p_{A}\\omega_{A}+p_{B}\\omega_{B}+\\cdots, $$\nand line broadening arises from chemical exchange. The exchange contribution to transverse relaxation is increased compared to a static protein, leading to broader lines. Broad peaks that can be partially sharpened by processing are characteristic of exchange broadening in the microsecond-to-millisecond regime, where exchange rates are comparable to or faster than the chemical shift differences. A static mixture of non-interconverting states would instead produce multiple distinct sets of peaks, not one averaged set.\n\n- Evaluate option A (largely unfolded): An unfolded state would typically show chemical shifts near random-coil values and often relatively sharp resonances for small disordered proteins, whereas here the complex is identifiable in cryo-ET as numerous copies of a structured complex and the NMR peaks are a single averaged set with exchange broadening, indicating folded conformational states undergoing exchange rather than a globally unfolded ensemble.\n\n- Evaluate option B (stable, static two-state mixture): If two distinct conformations do not interconvert on the NMR timescale, one expects two separate sets of peaks corresponding to the two states. The observation of a single set rules this out. Moreover, subtomogram averaging of a static mixture could, in principle, be improved by classification into the two states; persistent blurriness suggests interconverting heterogeneity rather than a fixed mixture.\n\n- Evaluate option D (single rigid conformation; ET artifacts only): A single rigid conformation would favor high-resolution subtomogram averaging if sufficient particles and alignment quality are achieved. Independently, a rigid, static conformation would not produce exchange-broadened lines in NMR; the observed broadening specifically points to conformational exchange, not purely technical artifacts in ET.\n\n- Evaluate option E (aggregation into insoluble clumps): Large aggregates in cells would typically yield severely broadened or vanished NMR signals due to very slow tumbling and heterogeneity, rather than a clean single set of peaks that can be sharpened by processing. Cryo-ET would more likely reveal large clumps rather than numerous discrete copies suitable for subtomogram extraction.\n\n- Synthesis: The cryo-ET blurriness is naturally explained by conformational heterogeneity and interconversion that defeats simple averaging, and the in-cell NMR single, broadened set of peaks is the hallmark of rapid exchange on the NMR timescale. Together, these strongly support that the protein is rapidly exchanging among distinct conformations on a microsecond-to-millisecond timescale.\n\nTherefore, the most likely biophysical state is rapid conformational exchange.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2114679"}]}
