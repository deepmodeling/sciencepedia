The goal is to understand the structure of the amyloid fibrils formed by this peptide. The researcher prepares two separate batches of the peptide under slightly different buffer conditions, creating Sample A and Sample B. To investigate the atomic-level structure of the resulting aggregates, the researcher uses solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a technique that probes the local magnetic environment of atomic nuclei. For both samples, a two-dimensional (2D) ${^{13}}\\text{C}$-${^{13}}\\text{C}$ correlation spectrum is recorded.\n\nThe results are distinct:\n- The spectrum for Sample A shows a set of very sharp, well-defined peaks.\n- The spectrum for Sample B shows peaks that are significantly broader and more poorly resolved.\n\nAssuming both experiments were performed correctly under identical instrumental conditions (magnetic field strength, temperature, etc.), what is the most scientifically sound conclusion about the structural nature of the amyloid fibrils in the two samples?\n\nA. The fibrils in Sample A are more flexible and undergo larger amplitude motions than the fibrils in Sample B.\n\nB. The fibrils in Sample A are structurally uniform and homogeneous, whereas the fibrils in Sample B are structurally heterogeneous, possibly consisting of a mixture of different conformations (polymorphs).\n\nC. Sample A contained a significantly higher concentration of the peptide than Sample B, leading to a better quality spectrum.\n\nD. The fibrils in Sample A are structurally disordered and amorphous, while the fibrils in Sample B are highly ordered and crystalline.\n\nE. The peptide in Sample A aggregated much faster than the peptide in Sample B.", "solution": "We analyze the spectral line widths in solid-state NMR under the stated condition that instrumental parameters (magnetic field, temperature, MAS rate, pulse sequences) are identical for both samples. The principal observable is the linewidth and resolution of ${^{13}}\\text{C}$ signals in a two-dimensional ${^{13}}\\text{C}$-${^{13}}\\text{C}$ correlation spectrum.\n\n1) The full width at half maximum of an NMR resonance is governed by\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu_{1/2} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\pi T_{2}^{*}},\n$$\nwhere $T_{2}^{*}$ is the effective transverse relaxation time including both homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions. A standard decomposition is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T_{2}^{*}}=\\frac{1}{T_{2}}+\\Gamma_{\\text{inh}},\n$$\nwhere $1/T_{2}$ collects homogeneous broadening mechanisms (e.g., residual dipolar couplings, chemical shift anisotropy remnants, pulse imperfections), and $\\Gamma_{\\text{inh}}$ reflects inhomogeneous broadening from distributions of local chemical environments (e.g., static conformational heterogeneity leading to a distribution of isotropic chemical shifts). Under magic-angle spinning, major anisotropic interactions are averaged, so differences in $\\Delta \\nu_{1/2}$ across otherwise identical instrumental conditions predominantly report sample-intrinsic factors, especially structural heterogeneity.\n\n2) Structural uniformity versus heterogeneity: If all peptides in the fibrils adopt a single conformation (a single polymorph), then the distribution of isotropic chemical shifts is narrow. This reduces $\\Gamma_{\\text{inh}}$, increases $T_{2}^{*}$, and thus gives sharp, well-resolved peaks. Conversely, if there is a mixture of conformations (polymorphs) or static disorder within fibrils, the isotropic chemical shifts are distributed across multiple nearby values. In a spectrum, this appears as broadened and poorly resolved peaks due to a larger $\\Gamma_{\\text{inh}}$ and hence smaller $T_{2}^{*}$.\n\n3) Role of molecular motions: Larger-amplitude motions can, in some regimes, cause motional narrowing, increasing $T_{2}$ and narrowing lines. However, in rigid amyloid fibrils studied by cross-polarization based ${^{13}}\\text{C}$ detection, increased mobility typically reduces cross-polarization efficiency and often leads to signal attenuation or disappearance rather than uniformly sharper, well-resolved cross-peaks. Furthermore, identical instrumental conditions and the typical rigidity of amyloid fibrils make structural heterogeneity the dominant explanation for broadening rather than enhanced large-amplitude mobility in one sample.\n\n4) Concentration and aggregation rate: Changing concentration predominantly affects signal-to-noise ratio, not intrinsic linewidth under otherwise identical conditions, barring nonstandard effects (e.g., radiation damping) that are not implicated here. The aggregation rate (fast versus slow) is a kinetic parameter and does not by itself determine the final spectral linewidth; rather, the final structural state (homogeneous versus heterogeneous) governs $\\Gamma_{\\text{inh}}$ and thus the observed resolution.\n\n5) Therefore, the best-supported conclusion is that Sample A, with sharp, well-defined peaks, reflects a structurally uniform and homogeneous fibril population (single polymorph), whereas Sample B, with broad, poorly resolved peaks, reflects structural heterogeneity, likely a mixture of conformations or polymorphs.

The carbons in the rigid transmembrane domain have a much higher natural abundance than those in the flexible C-terminal domain.\n\nB. The rapid molecular tumbling of the flexible C-terminal domain averages out the heteronuclear dipolar couplings between ${^1}\\text{H}$ and ${^{13}}\\text{C}$, making the Cross-Polarization transfer process inefficient.\n\nC.

The rigid transmembrane domain, being embedded in the lipid bilayer, is physically closer to the NMR detection coil, leading to stronger signal reception.\n\nE.

The near disappearance is due to CP inefficiency, not shift degeneracy.\n- D is incorrect because NMR coil sensitivity does not selectively favor the embedded rigid domain; the dominant effect is the presence or absence of effective dipolar couplings for CP.\n- E is incorrect because flexible regions generally have longer $T_{1}$; additionally, CP-MAS detects transverse magnetization after transfer, so $T_{1}$ does not cause immediate signal loss in the acquisition window.\n\nTherefore, the correct physical explanation is that fast motion in the flexible C-terminal domain averages the heteronuclear dipolar couplings, suppressing CP efficiency and thus the observed ${^{13}}\\text{C}$ signal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2138540"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative interpretation, solid-state NMR provides a powerful toolkit for determining high-resolution structures by measuring a variety of geometric restraints.
