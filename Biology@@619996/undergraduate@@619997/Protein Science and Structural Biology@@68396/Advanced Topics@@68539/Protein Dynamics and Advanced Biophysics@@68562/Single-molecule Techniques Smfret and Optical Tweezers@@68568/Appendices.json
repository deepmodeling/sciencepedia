When a protein is stretched and then allowed to relax, the force-extension curves for each phase are often not identical, a phenomenon known as hysteresis.

The experiment consists of mechanically stretching the protein from a fully relaxed state at extension $x=0$ to a maximum extension $x=L$, and then allowing it to relax back to $x=0$.\n\nDue to the complex energy landscape of protein folding, the process exhibits hysteresis. The force-extension relationship is different for the pulling (stretching) and relaxation phases. For this particular protein and experimental conditions, these relationships can be effectively modeled by two distinct linear functions over the range $0 \\leq x \\leq L$:\n\n- Pulling phase: $F_{pull}(x) = k_1 x$\n- Relaxation phase: $F_{relax}(x) = k_2 x$\n\nHere, $F$ is the restoring force exerted by the protein, $x$ is the end-to-end extension of the molecule, and $k_1$ and $k_2$ are effective spring constants with $k_1 > k_2$. The difference between $k_1$ and $k_2$ reflects the energy barrier for refolding, which causes the protein to refold at lower forces than the forces at which it was unfolded.\n\nAssuming this model is accurate, calculate the total energy dissipated as heat during one complete cycle of stretching from $x=0$ to $x=L$ and returning to $x=0$.
