The cantilever itself can be modeled as a simple spring.\n\nFor a particular experiment, a cantilever with a spring constant of $k = 0.052 \\text{ N/m}$ is used.

This law states that the restoring force, $F$, exerted by a spring is directly proportional to the displacement, $x$, from its equilibrium position. The formula is given by:\n$$F = kx$$\nwhere $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the magnitude of the displacement (deflection).\n\nIn this problem, the protein exerts a force on the cantilever, causing it to deflect. By Newton's third law, the force exerted by the protein on the cantilever is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the restoring force exerted by the cantilever. We are asked to find the magnitude of this force.\n\nThe given parameters are:\nSpring constant, $k = 0.052 \\text{ N/m}$\nDeflection, $x = d = 15.5 \\text{ nm}$\n\nThe units of the spring constant are in Newtons per meter (N/m), while the deflection is given in nanometers (nm). To ensure consistency of units in our calculation, we must convert the deflection from nanometers to meters.\nThe conversion is $1 \\text{ nm} = 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$.\nSo, the deflection in meters is:\n$$x = 15.5 \\text{ nm} \\times \\frac{10^{-9} \\text{ m}}{1 \\text{ nm}} = 15.5 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$$\n\nNow we can substitute the values of $k$ and $x$ into Hooke's Law to calculate the force in Newtons:\n$$F = (0.052 \\text{ N/m}) \\times (15.5 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m})$$\n$$F = 0.806 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ N}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be in picoNewtons (pN).

This exercise [@problem_id:2100108] challenges you to interpret a descriptive account of such an experiment. By learning to distinguish meaningful unfolding events from the final detachment of the molecule, you can extract valuable structural information, such as the number of folded domains composing a modular protein.", "problem": "A biophysicist is studying a newly discovered protein, \"Flexitin,\" which is thought to possess a modular structure composed of multiple, independently folded domains. To probe this structure, the researcher performs a single-molecule force spectroscopy experiment using an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) apparatus. In this experiment, one end of a single Flexitin molecule is covalently attached to a functionalized surface, and the other end is attached to the AFM tip. The tip is then retracted at a constant velocity, applying a stretching force to the protein.\n\nThe experiment yields a force-extension curve, which plots the measured force as a function of the distance between the surface and the tip. The curve exhibits the following sequence of events:\n\n1.  Initially, the force increases as the protein's native structure is stretched.\n2.  At an extension of 50 nm, the force reaches a peak of 180 pN, then suddenly drops to 40 pN over a very short extension change. The chain is now longer.\n3.  The force then builds up again as the now-partially-unfolded chain is stretched further.\n4.  At an extension of 85 nm, the force reaches a second peak of 175 pN and again drops abruptly to 45 pN.\n5.  This pattern repeats. At an extension of 120 nm, the force peaks at 185 pN and drops suddenly to 50 pN.\n6.  Finally, after the last drop, the force rises once more until, at an extension of 150 nm, the force abruptly falls to 0 pN and remains there.\n\nIn this type of experiment, each distinct, sudden drop in force (where the force does not fall to zero) corresponds to the force-induced unfolding of a single stable domain. The final event where the force drops to zero represents the complete detachment of the protein from either the tip or the surface.\n\nBased on the described experimental observations, determine the number of folded domains in a single molecule of Flexitin.", "solution": "Interpretation principle: In single-molecule AFM pulling of a modular protein, each abrupt force drop that does not go to zero corresponds to the unfolding of one stable domain, while the final drop to zero corresponds to rupture (detachment) rather than a domain unfolding. Thus, the number of folded domains equals the count of nonzero force drops observed before the terminal drop to zero, i.e., $N_{\\text{domains}}=N_{\\text{drops (nonzero)}}$.\n\nApply to the described force-extension sequence:\n- The first nonzero drop occurs at an extension of 50 nm where the force peaks at 180 pN and suddenly drops to 40 pN. Count $1$.\n- The second nonzero drop occurs at 85 nm where the force peaks at 175 pN and drops to 45 pN. Count $2$.\n- The third nonzero drop occurs at 120 nm where the force peaks at 185 pN and drops to 50 pN. Count $3$.\n- The final event at 150 nm is a drop to 0 pN and represents detachment, not a domain unfolding, so it is not counted.\n\nTherefore, the number of folded domains in a single Flexitin molecule is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2100108"}, {"introduction": "In a real AFM experiment, the total distance the instrument's piezo-stage moves, $z$, is not solely due to the protein's extension, $x$; the cantilever itself also bends under force.

The resulting force, $F$, on the cantilever is measured as a function of the distance the piezo-stage has moved, $z$.\n\nThe total extension measured by the piezo-stage, $z$, is the sum of the protein's true end-to-end extension, $x$, and the deflection of the cantilever, $d$. The cantilever itself acts as a Hookean spring with a known spring constant, $k$.\n\nDuring a single pulling trace, a series of force peaks are observed. The data for two consecutive peaks, which correspond to the unfolding of two identical, sequential domains, are recorded.
