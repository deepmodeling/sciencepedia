The RPLC system utilizes a C18 column, which contains a non-polar (hydrophobic) stationary phase. The separation is performed using a gradient elution, where the mobile phase composition changes over time. The experiment starts with Solvent A (an aqueous solution with 0.1% formic acid, making it highly polar) and the percentage of Solvent B (acetonitrile, a less polar organic solvent) is gradually increased. The mobile phase is maintained at a pH of approximately 2.5 throughout the run.\n\nConsider two synthetic tetrapeptides present in the mixture:\n1.  **Peptide F4**: A tetrapeptide with the sequence Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe, composed of four Phenylalanine (F) residues.\n2.  **Peptide E4**: A tetrapeptide with the sequence Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu, composed of four Glutamic Acid (E) residues.\n\nWhich peptide will be retained longer on the column, thus requiring a higher concentration of Solvent B (acetonitrile) to elute, and what is the fundamental reason for this behavior?\n\nA. Peptide E4, because its side chains are more polar, leading to stronger interactions with the non-polar stationary phase.\n\nB.

Peptide F4, because its side chains are aromatic, allowing it to move faster through the polar mobile phase.\n\nE. Both peptides will elute at the same time and concentration of Solvent B because they have the same number of amino acid residues.", "solution": "We identify the chromatographic mode and dominant interactions. In Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography (RPLC) with a C18 stationary phase, the stationary phase is non-polar (hydrophobic), while the starting mobile phase is polar. Retention increases with analyte hydrophobicity: more hydrophobic analytes partition more strongly into the non-polar stationary phase, exhibit larger distribution coefficients, and thus elute later, requiring a higher proportion of the less polar organic solvent (acetonitrile) to disrupt these interactions.\n\nWe analyze the ionization state of the peptide side chains at the stated pH. The glutamic acid side chain has a carboxylic acid group with an acid dissociation constant characterized by $pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}}$. The Henderson–Hasselbalch relation for a weak acid is\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}} + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}\\right),\n$$\nso equivalently\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]} = 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}}}.\n$$\nBecause the run is maintained at $\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 2.5$ with $\\mathrm{pH} < pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}}$, it follows that $10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}}} < 1$, so the side-chain carboxyl groups in glutamic acid residues are predominantly in the protonated (neutral) form. Nevertheless, even when protonated, carboxylic acid groups are polar and hydrogen-bonding, rendering the peptide more hydrophilic than one composed of non-polar side chains.\n\nWe compare the two peptides’ side-chain properties:\n- Peptide F4 (Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe) presents four large, non-polar aromatic side chains, which are highly hydrophobic. Such side chains promote strong hydrophobic interactions with the C18 stationary phase, increasing retention.\n- Peptide E4 (Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu) presents four carboxylic acid side chains. At $\\mathrm{pH} < pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}}$ they are largely protonated (neutral) but remain polar and more compatible with the polar aqueous mobile phase, leading to weaker hydrophobic interactions with the stationary phase and shorter retention relative to F4.\n\nTherefore, the peptide requiring a higher concentration of acetonitrile (Solvent B) to elute will be the more hydrophobic one, namely F4, because its large non-polar aromatic side chains engage in stronger hydrophobic interactions with the non-polar C18 stationary phase.\n\nThis eliminates incorrect alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because greater polarity does not increase interaction with a non-polar stationary phase.\n- C is incorrect because at the given pH the glutamate side chains are mostly protonated and, regardless, the stationary phase is non-ionic.\n- D is incorrect because aromaticity increases hydrophobic interactions with the stationary phase, not mobility in the polar mobile phase.\n- E is incorrect because retention depends on hydrophobicity, not merely on peptide length or residue count.\n\nThus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2101857"}, {"introduction": "Once peptides are separated and introduced into a mass spectrometer, the instrument measures their mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$).

A key challenge is an inability to determine if multiple Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) located far apart on a protein sequence occur on the same single molecule. This advanced conceptual problem asks you to pinpoint the fundamental step in the workflow that leads to this loss of information, pushing you to think critically about the difference between identifying peptides and characterizing complete \"proteoforms\" [@problem_id:2101848].", "problem": "In the field of protein science, a \"proteoform\" refers to a specific molecular form of a protein, distinguished by variations that arise from a single gene, such as genetic mutations, alternative splicing, or Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs). A central challenge in proteomics is characterizing the complete set of proteoforms for a given protein.\n\nConsider a hypothetical 50 kDa protein, \"Signalin,\" which is involved in cellular signaling pathways. Analysis of cell lysates has confirmed that Signalin can be modified by both phosphorylation (a PTM that adds approximately 80 Da to a residue) and acetylation (a PTM that adds approximately 42 Da to a residue). An investigator wants to determine if these two PTMs can occur simultaneously on the same single molecule of Signalin, or if the cell population only contains a mixture of singly phosphorylated Signalin and singly acetylated Signalin.\n\nThe investigator employs a standard bottom-up proteomics workflow. This process involves: (A) extracting and denaturing the total protein from the cells; (B) digesting the proteins into smaller peptides using an enzyme like trypsin; (C) separating these peptides using Liquid Chromatography (LC); (D) analyzing the peptides via tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) to determine their sequence and modifications; and (E) searching the resulting data against a protein database to identify the peptides.\n\nEven if peptides corresponding to a phosphorylated site and peptides corresponding to an acetylated site are both detected, this standard workflow is inherently incapable of distinguishing between a single Signalin molecule carrying both PTMs and a mixed population of Signalin molecules each carrying only one of the PTMs, assuming the two modification sites are far apart on the protein sequence.\n\nWhich step in the standard bottom-up proteomics workflow described is the fundamental reason for this loss of information about the co-occurrence of distant PTMs on a single protein molecule?\n\nA.

Database searching and peptide identification", "solution": "We are asked which step in a standard bottom-up proteomics workflow fundamentally causes the loss of information about whether two distant post-translational modifications (PTMs) co-occur on the same single protein molecule.\n\nIn bottom-up proteomics, the intact protein is first extracted and denatured (A), then cleaved by a protease such as trypsin into shorter peptides (B). These peptides are then separated by liquid chromatography (C), analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry to identify their sequences and any modifications present on each peptide (D), and finally matched to database sequences to identify the parent protein and modified peptides (E).\n\nThe key requirement to determine co-occurrence of PTMs on the same single molecule is to preserve the covalent linkage information across the entire protein sequence, or at least across the region spanning the two modification sites. If the two PTMs are far apart in the primary sequence, a typical protease such as trypsin will cleave at multiple sites and produce separate peptides, each carrying at most one of the distant PTMs if they lie on different peptides. Once the protein is cleaved, the original linkage information that both PTMs resided on the same individual protein molecule is destroyed. All downstream steps (C, D, E) operate on peptide-level analytes and cannot reconstruct whether two modified peptides originated from the same individual protein molecule, because they are analyzed independently and mixed with peptides from all protein copies in the sample. Step A (extraction and denaturation) does not itself break the protein backbone and thus does not inherently destroy this specific co-occurrence information. Therefore, the fundamental cause of the information loss about co-occurrence of distant PTMs is the proteolytic digestion into smaller peptides.\n\nThus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2101848"}]}
