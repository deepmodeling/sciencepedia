{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "At its heart, quantitative proteomics aims to answer a simple question: how do protein levels change in response to a stimulus? The SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture) technique provides an elegant way to do this by using isotopic labels to differentiate proteins from different cell populations within a single experiment. This first exercise walks you through the fundamental calculation in a SILAC experiment, demonstrating how raw data from a mass spectrometer is converted into a clear, quantitative measure of relative protein abundance [@problem_id:2132097].", "problem": "A team of biochemists is investigating how a novel drug affects the cellular level of a target protein, Protein P. To quantify this effect, they employ a quantitative proteomics technique known as Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC).\n\nTwo populations of human cells are cultured. The first, the control group, is grown in a standard \"light\" medium. The second, the experimental group, is treated with the drug and grown in a \"heavy\" medium, in which all lysine amino acids have been replaced with their heavy isotope-labeled counterparts. After the treatment period, equal numbers of cells from both the control and experimental groups are combined. The total protein content is extracted from the mixed cell lysate, and the proteins are digested into peptides using the enzyme trypsin.\n\nThe resulting peptide mixture is analyzed by a mass spectrometer. A specific peptide unique to Protein P is identified for quantification. The mass spectrometer detects two peaks for this peptide: one \"light\" version from the control cells and one \"heavy\" version from the drug-treated cells. The integrated signal intensity for the light peptide peak is measured to be 150,000 units, while the intensity for the heavy peptide peak is 450,000 units.\n\nAssuming the peak intensity in the mass spectrum is directly proportional to the amount of peptide present, calculate the relative abundance of Protein P in the drug-treated cells compared to the control cells.", "solution": "We use the SILAC quantification principle: the integrated MS peak intensity is directly proportional to the amount of the corresponding peptide. With equal numbers of control and drug-treated cells mixed prior to lysis, the ratio of heavy (drug-treated) to light (control) peptide intensities equals the relative abundance of the protein in drug-treated versus control cells.\n\nLet $I_{L}$ be the integrated intensity of the light peptide (control) and $I_{H}$ be the integrated intensity of the heavy peptide (drug-treated). The relative abundance $R$ is\n$$\nR=\\frac{I_{H}}{I_{L}}.\n$$\nGiven $I_{L}=150000$ and $I_{H}=450000$, we compute\n$$\nR=\\frac{450000}{150000}=3.\n$$\nTherefore, Protein P is three times as abundant in the drug-treated cells compared to the control cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2132097"}, {"introduction": "While the ideal experiment provides clean data, real-world proteomics data often contains puzzles that require careful interpretation. One common observation is a \"missed cleavage,\" where the digestive enzyme trypsin fails to cut a protein at an expected site. This practice explores the biochemical reasons behind such events, showing how they can be clues to important post-translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate a protein's function [@problem_id:2132046].", "problem": "A researcher is conducting a bottom-up proteomics experiment to identify proteins in a cell lysate. The protocol involves denaturing the proteins, reducing and alkylating cysteine residues, and finally digesting the entire protein mixture into smaller peptides using the enzyme trypsin. The resulting peptide mixture is then analyzed by tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS).\n\nTrypsin is a protease that specifically cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl-side (C-terminal side) of lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues. However, this cleavage is inhibited if the residue immediately following the lysine or arginine is a proline (P).\n\nDuring data analysis, the researcher identifies a high-confidence peptide with the sequence `A-E-I-K-Q-A-V-R`. This peptide must have been generated by a cleavage event after an upstream arginine and the terminal arginine shown. However, the expected cleavage after the internal lysine (K) residue did not occur, an event known as a \"missed cleavage\". The researcher confirms that the observed mass of the peptide corresponds to the given sequence plus a single, specific chemical modification on the internal lysine residue.\n\nWhich of the following post-translational modifications to the side chain of the internal lysine (K) residue is the most likely reason for the observed missed cleavage by trypsin?\n\nA. Methylation, the addition of a methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$).\n\nB. Acetylation, the addition of an acetyl group ($-\\text{COCH}_3$).\n\nC. Hydroxylation, the addition of a hydroxyl group ($-\\text{OH}$).\n\nD. Phosphorylation, the addition of a phosphate group ($-\\text{PO}_3^{2-}$).", "solution": "The problem asks for the most likely post-translational modification on a lysine residue that would inhibit cleavage by the enzyme trypsin. To solve this, we must understand the molecular basis of trypsin's substrate specificity.\n\nStep 1: Understand the mechanism of trypsin cleavage.\nTrypsin is a serine protease. Its catalytic activity relies on a catalytic triad (serine, histidine, aspartate) in its active site. However, its specificity—why it cleaves only after lysine (K) and arginine (R)—is determined by its substrate-binding pocket, also known as the S1 pocket. The S1 pocket of trypsin is deep and contains a negatively charged aspartate residue (Asp 189) at its bottom.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the properties of trypsin's target residues.\nThe side chains of both lysine and arginine are positively charged at physiological pH. Lysine has a primary amino group ($-\\text{NH}_3^{+}$) at the end of its butyl side chain. Arginine has a guanidinium group, which is also positively charged. This positive charge is crucial for substrate recognition. The long, flexible, positively charged side chains of lysine and arginine fit into the deep S1 pocket of trypsin, where the positive charge on the substrate forms a stabilizing salt bridge with the negative charge of the Asp 189 residue in the enzyme's pocket. This specific binding positions the peptide bond C-terminal to the K/R residue correctly for cleavage by the catalytic triad.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate how each modification affects the lysine side chain and its interaction with trypsin.\nThe peptide sequence is `A-E-I-K-Q-A-V-R`, and the missed cleavage is at the internal lysine (K). The question is which modification on this lysine prevents the enzyme from recognizing and cleaving it.\n\nA. Methylation: This process adds a methyl group to the lysine's epsilon-amino group. Mono- and di-methylation still leave the nitrogen atom with a positive charge. While trimethylation maintains the positive charge, the increased steric bulk can hinder binding to the S1 pocket. However, methylation does not eliminate the fundamental electrostatic attraction, and some level of cleavage might still occur. It is generally considered a less potent inhibitor than modifications that remove the charge entirely.\n\nB. Acetylation: This process involves the transfer of an acetyl group to the epsilon-amino group of the lysine side chain. The chemical reaction is:\n$$ \\text{R}-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2-\\text{NH}_3^+ + \\text{Acetyl-CoA} \\rightarrow \\text{R}-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2-\\text{NH}-\\text{C(O)CH}_3 + \\text{H}^+ + \\text{CoA} $$\nThe key consequence of this modification is that the primary amine is converted into a secondary amide. This conversion neutralizes the positive charge of the side chain. Without the positive charge, the lysine side chain can no longer form the critical salt bridge with the aspartate residue in trypsin's S1 pocket. The electrostatic attraction is lost, preventing the substrate from binding correctly. Therefore, acetylation is a very effective and common mechanism for inhibiting trypsin cleavage at lysine residues.\n\nC. Hydroxylation: This adds a hydroxyl group ($-\\text{OH}$) to the lysine side chain. This modification does not affect the primary amino group at the end of the side chain, which remains protonated and positively charged ($-\\text{NH}_3^{+}$). Thus, the key electrostatic interaction required for trypsin binding is preserved. Hydroxylation would not be expected to inhibit trypsin cleavage.\n\nD. Phosphorylation: This modification adds a bulky, negatively charged phosphate group. While phosphorylation is a critical post-translational modification, it occurs predominantly on the hydroxyl groups of serine (S), threonine (T), and tyrosine (Y) residues. It does not naturally occur on the amino group of lysine. Therefore, it is not a plausible explanation.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the most likely reason.\nBased on the chemical mechanism of trypsin, the neutralization of the positive charge on the lysine side chain is the most direct and effective way to inhibit cleavage. Acetylation accomplishes precisely this. Therefore, it is the most common and chemically sound explanation for a missed cleavage at a lysine site due to a post-translational modification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2132046"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simply measuring protein abundance, quantitative proteomics offers powerful tools to study the dynamics of protein regulation. Post-translational modifications, like phosphorylation, act as molecular switches that control protein activity.

The 'control' population is grown in a medium containing normal, 'light' arginine. The 'treated' population is grown in a medium containing a 'heavy' isotope-labeled version of arginine, and these cells are also exposed to the kinase inhibitor drug.\n\nAfter the treatment period, the light and heavy cell populations are combined in a 1:1 ratio. The proteins are extracted, digested into peptides, and the resulting peptide mixture is analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The analysis focuses on a specific target peptide that can exist in either an unphosphorylated or a singly phosphorylated state.\n\nThe mass spectrometer measures the signal intensity for four distinct species originating from this target peptide:\n- $I_{L,u}$: Signal intensity of the light, unphosphorylated peptide (from control cells).\n- $I_{L,p}$: Signal intensity of the light, phosphorylated peptide (from control cells).\n- $I_{H,u}$: Signal intensity of the heavy, unphosphorylated peptide (from treated cells).\n- $I_{H,p}$: Signal intensity of the heavy, phosphorylated peptide (from treated cells).\n\nAssume that the integrated signal intensity of a given peptide is directly proportional to its molar amount in the sample.
