In this technique, the protein complex is gently transferred into the gas phase, retaining much of its native structure and acquiring multiple positive charges, typically by the addition of protons. The mass spectrometer then separates these ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$). The resulting mass spectrum displays a series of peaks, known as a charge state series, where each peak corresponds to the same protein complex but with a different number of charges.\n\nThe analysis reveals two prominent and adjacent peaks in the charge state distribution. The first peak has a mass-to-charge ratio of $7501.0$ Th (Thomson, where 1 Th = 1 Da/e), and the second adjacent peak has a mass-to-charge ratio of $7143.9$ Th. Assuming that the charge is due to the adduction of protons, and the mass of a single proton ($m_p$) is $1.007$ Daltons (Da), calculate the total mass of the neutral protein complex.\n\nReport your final answer for the mass of the complex in Daltons (Da), rounded to five significant figures.", "solution": "Let $M$ be the unknown mass of the neutral protein complex in Daltons (Da). Let $m_p$ be the mass of a proton, given as $m_p = 1.007$ Da. In the mass spectrometer, the protein complex is observed as ions with a total mass of $M_{ion} = M + z \\cdot m_p$, where $z$ is an integer representing the number of protons added (the charge state). The instrument measures the mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z = \\frac{M_{ion}}{z}$.\n\nWe are given two adjacent peaks from the charge state series. Let's denote their mass-to-charge ratios as $(m/z)_1 = 7501.0$ and $(m/z)_2 = 7143.9$. Adjacent peaks in a charge state series differ by a single charge. A higher charge state ($z+1$) will result in a lower mass-to-charge ratio, assuming $M$ is large compared to $z \\cdot m_p$. Therefore, the peak with the lower $m/z$ value, $(m/z)_2$, corresponds to a higher charge state.\n\nLet the charge state for the peak at $(m/z)_1$ be $z$. Then the charge state for the adjacent peak at $(m/z)_2$ must be $z+1$. We can write two equations based on this:\n\nEquation 1: For the peak with charge $z$:\n$$ (m/z)_1 = \\frac{M + z \\cdot m_p}{z} $$\n\nEquation 2: For the peak with charge $z+1$:\n$$ (m/z)_2 = \\frac{M + (z+1) \\cdot m_p}{z+1} $$\n\nWe have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $M$ and $z$. Our goal is to solve for $M$. First, we can solve for the charge state $z$. Let's rearrange both equations to express $M$ in terms of $z$.\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n$$ z \\cdot (m/z)_1 = M + z \\cdot m_p $$\n$$ M = z \\cdot (m/z)_1 - z \\cdot m_p = z \\left( (m/z)_1 - m_p \\right) $$\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n$$ (z+1) \\cdot (m/z)_2 = M + (z+1) \\cdot m_p $$\n$$ M = (z+1) \\cdot (m/z)_2 - (z+1) \\cdot m_p = (z+1) \\left( (m/z)_2 - m_p \\right) $$\n\nNow we can set the two expressions for $M$ equal to each other to solve for $z$:\n$$ z \\left( (m/z)_1 - m_p \\right) = (z+1) \\left( (m/z)_2 - m_p \\right) $$\n$$ z \\cdot (m/z)_1 - z \\cdot m_p = z \\cdot (m/z)_2 + (m/z)_2 - z \\cdot m_p - m_p $$\nThe term $-z \\cdot m_p$ cancels from both sides:\n$$ z \\cdot (m/z)_1 = z \\cdot (m/z)_2 + (m/z)_2 - m_p $$\nNow, we group the terms with $z$:\n$$ z \\cdot (m/z)_1 - z \\cdot (m/z)_2 = (m/z)_2 - m_p $$\n$$ z \\left( (m/z)_1 - (m/z)_2 \\right) = (m/z)_2 - m_p $$\n$$ z = \\frac{(m/z)_2 - m_p}{(m/z)_1 - (m/z)_2} $$\n\nNow, substitute the given numerical values: $(m/z)_1 = 7501.0$, $(m/z)_2 = 7143.9$, and $m_p = 1.007$.\n$$ z = \\frac{7143.9 - 1.007}{7501.0 - 7143.9} = \\frac{7142.893}{357.1} \\approx 19.9997 $$\nSince the charge state $z$ must be an integer, we can confidently round this to $z=20$.\n\nNow that we have the value of $z$, we can substitute it back into either expression for $M$ to find the mass of the complex.\n\nUsing the first expression (for the peak with charge $z=20$):\n$$ M = 20 \\left( 7501.0 - 1.007 \\right) = 20 \\left( 7499.993 \\right) = 149999.86 \\text{ Da} $$\n\nAs a check, we can also use the second expression (for the peak with charge $z+1=21$):\n$$ M = (20+1) \\left( 7143.9 - 1.007 \\right) = 21 \\left( 7142.893 \\right) = 149999.753 \\text{ Da} $$\n\nThe small discrepancy between the two calculated masses is due to the limited precision of the experimental $m/z$ values provided.
