A critical test of this hypothesis is to determine if the presence of the normal host protein, $PrP^C$, is essential for the propagation of its pathogenic counterpart, $PrP^{Sc}$. This classic thought experiment [@problem_id:2068133] challenges you to predict the outcome of an elegant biological scenario designed to isolate the role of the $PrP^C$ substrate, forcing you to apply the fundamental principle of templated conversion.", "problem": "Prion diseases, such as scrapie in sheep and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, are fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by the misfolding of a native cellular protein. The normal, functional protein is called the cellular Prion Protein (PrP^C), which is encoded by the PRNP gene. The infectious, misfolded isoform is called the scrapie Prion Protein (PrP^Sc). The central pathogenic mechanism involves PrP^Sc acting as a template to induce the conformational conversion of PrP^C into more PrP^Sc, leading to an exponential accumulation of the pathogenic form, subsequent aggregation, and neuronal cell death.\n\nConsider a sophisticated experiment designed to probe the mechanism of prion propagation. A line of genetically engineered mice has been created that completely lacks the PRNP gene; these mice are referred to as PRNP-null mice. Consequently, their cells do not produce any PrP^C. A small piece of brain tissue from a normal, wild-type mouse that expresses PrP^C is surgically implanted into the brain of an adult PRNP-null mouse. The graft successfully integrates with the host's tissue. Following a recovery period, the chimeric mouse is intracerebrally inoculated with a high titer of infectious PrP^Sc.\n\nBased on the established mechanism of prion replication, which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed several months after inoculation?\n\nA. The entire brain of the PRNP-null mouse, including both the host tissue and the graft, will show widespread spongiform degeneration and PrP^Sc accumulation, and the mouse will develop clinical signs of scrapie.\n\nB. The PRNP-null mouse will remain completely asymptomatic, and the inoculated PrP^Sc will be effectively cleared from the brain by microglia without causing any pathology in either the graft or the host tissue.\n\nC. The grafted wild-type tissue will show significant PrP^Sc accumulation, astrocytosis, and spongiform degeneration, but the surrounding PRNP-null host brain tissue will remain entirely free of pathology.\n\nD. The inoculated PrP^Sc will replicate within the graft and then spread into the surrounding PRNP-null host tissue, eventually causing widespread pathology and disease, albeit at a much slower rate than in a wild-type mouse.\n\nE. The inoculated PrP^Sc will accumulate within the graft but will be unable to replicate, leading to a localized, non-progressive plaque without causing significant neuronal loss or clinical symptoms.", "solution": "The core physical principle of prion propagation is templated conformational conversion: the infectious isoform acts as a catalyst that converts the normal isoform into more of the infectious form. This can be represented schematically as a net conversion step,\n$$\n\\text{PrP}^{\\text{Sc}} + \\text{PrP}^{\\text{C}} \\to 2\\,\\text{PrP}^{\\text{Sc}},\n$$\nfollowed by aggregation of $\\text{PrP}^{\\text{Sc}}$ and associated neurotoxicity. A necessary condition for replication is the presence of the substrate $\\text{PrP}^{\\text{C}}$. In cells that lack the PRNP gene, the cellular prion protein is absent, which can be summarized as an effective substrate concentration of $\\text{PrP}^{\\text{C}}=0$. Under this condition, the conversion step cannot proceed, so there is no amplification of $\\text{PrP}^{\\text{Sc}}$ and no prion-driven pathology in those cells.\n\nIn the described chimeric mouse, only the grafted wild-type brain tissue expresses $\\text{PrP}^{\\text{C}}$; the surrounding PRNP-null host brain does not. After intracerebral inoculation with $\\text{PrP}^{\\text{Sc}}$, the seeded conversion and exponential accumulation can occur within the grafted tissue because it provides the required substrate $\\text{PrP}^{\\text{C}}$. Consequently, the graft will show $\\text{PrP}^{\\text{Sc}}$ accumulation, spongiform change, and reactive gliosis.\n\nBy contrast, in the PRNP-null host tissue, there is no $\\text{PrP}^{\\text{C}}$ to convert, so any $\\text{PrP}^{\\text{Sc}}$ that diffuses into the host cannot replicate. Without local replication and accumulation, the characteristic prion pathology does not develop in the host tissue. While innate mechanisms (e.g., microglial uptake) may influence the fate of inoculum, they do not prevent ongoing amplification inside the graft where $\\text{PrP}^{\\text{C}}$ is present.\n\nEvaluating the options: \n- A is incorrect because widespread pathology requires replication throughout the brain, which the PRNP-null host cannot support. \n- B is incorrect because the graft allows replication and pathology; the mouse would not remain entirely normal. \n- C is correct because pathology will localize to the graft that expresses $\\text{PrP}^{\\text{C}}$, with the PRNP-null host tissue remaining free of prion-induced lesions. \n- D is incorrect because spread into PRNP-null tissue cannot yield replication or widespread disease. \n- E is incorrect because the graft supports replication; accumulation there will be replicative and progressive, not a non-replicative, static deposit.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is pathology confined to the grafted wild-type tissue with the PRNP-null host tissue spared.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2068133"}, {"introduction": "While the presence of $PrP^C$ is necessary for prion propagation, not all $PrP^C$ molecules are equally susceptible to conversion.

By analyzing hypothetical data, you will explore the powerful relationship between the thermodynamic stability of the $PrP^C$ fold and the age at which disease manifests, learning how to quantify the impact of destabilizing mutations.", "problem": "Familial human prion diseases, such as Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome and fatal familial insomnia, are fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding the prion protein (PrP). The disease mechanism involves the conformational conversion of the normal cellular prion protein (PrP^C) into a misfolded, aggregation-prone isoform known as scrapie prion protein (PrP^Sc). It is hypothesized that mutations associated with these diseases decrease the thermodynamic stability of the native PrP^C fold, thereby lowering the kinetic barrier for its conversion to PrP^Sc and leading to an earlier age of disease onset.\n\nTo investigate this hypothesis, a biophysicist studied the thermal stability of wild-type (WT) PrP^C and four different pathogenic mutants. The apparent thermal unfolding transition midpoint, $T_m$, for each protein was measured using Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF).
