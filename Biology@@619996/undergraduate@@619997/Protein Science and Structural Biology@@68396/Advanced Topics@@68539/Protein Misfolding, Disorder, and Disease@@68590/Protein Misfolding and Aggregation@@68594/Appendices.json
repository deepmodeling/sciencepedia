This exercise challenges you to think like a protein biochemist by predicting how a single mutation can catastrophically destabilize this core, a common trigger for misfolding and subsequent aggregation. By applying fundamental principles of amino acid chemistry, you will learn to identify the types of changes that are most likely to compromise a protein's structural integrity [@problem_id:2129379].", "problem": "A hypothetical globular protein, named cryostabilin, functions optimally in a cold-water organism and possesses a well-defined, tightly packed hydrophobic core. A key residue for maintaining this core structure is an isoleucine located at position 87 (Ile87), which is completely buried and surrounded by other nonpolar side chains. A researcher aims to create a mutant version of cryostabilin that is significantly more susceptible to misfolding and aggregation when subjected to a moderate increase in temperature (thermal stress). Which of the following single amino acid substitutions at position 87 would be most likely to achieve this goal?\n\nA. Isoleucine to Leucine (Ile87Leu)\n\nB. Isoleucine to Valine (Ile87Val)\n\nC. Isoleucine to Aspartic Acid (Ile87Asp)\n\nD. Isoleucine to Phenylalanine (Ile87Phe)", "solution": "Goal: identify the single substitution at a completely buried, hydrophobic-core isoleucine (Ile87) that most increases susceptibility to misfolding and aggregation under moderate thermal stress. Thermodynamically, this corresponds to choosing the mutation that most destabilizes the native fold.\n\nUse the protein folding free energy framework. The thermodynamic stability is given by\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{fold}} - T \\Delta S_{\\text{fold}},\n$$\nand the mutational effect on stability is\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}^{\\text{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}^{\\text{WT}}.\n$$\nA positive $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ indicates destabilization of the folded state, lowering the barrier to unfolding and thus increasing misfolding and aggregation upon heating.\n\nFor a tightly packed hydrophobic core, stability is dominated by the hydrophobic effect and optimal packing. Consider each substitution:\n\n1) Ile87Leu (A): Both Ile and Leu are aliphatic, nonpolar, and of similar volume and hydrophobicity. Core packing and the hydrophobic effect are largely preserved. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(\\text{Ile} \\to \\text{Leu}) \\approx 0,\n$$\nimplying minimal destabilization.\n\n2) Ile87Val (B): Val is slightly smaller but still nonpolar and hydrophobic. While a small cavity could form, the hydrophobic character is maintained. The destabilization is typically modest:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(\\text{Ile} \\to \\text{Val}) > 0 \\text{ (small)}.\n$$\n\n3) Ile87Asp (C): Aspartic acid carries a negatively charged side chain under physiological conditions. Burying a charged, polar group in a hydrophobic core incurs a large desolvation penalty and often leaves hydrogen-bonding capacity unsatisfied, both strongly destabilizing the folded state. This produces a large positive shift in folding free energy:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(\\text{Ile} \\to \\text{Asp}) \\gg 0.\n$$\nConsequently, $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ becomes much less negative (or even positive), lowering the melting temperature and promoting partial unfolding under moderate heat, which exposes hydrophobic patches and drives aggregation.\n\n4) Ile87Phe (D): Phenylalanine is hydrophobic and often compatible with cores, though bulkier. While it may introduce some steric strain if packing is tight, it maintains the hydrophobic character and can even be stabilizing in some contexts. Thus,\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(\\text{Ile} \\to \\text{Phe}) \\approx 0 \\text{ to modest } > 0,\n$$\nbut typically far less destabilizing than burying a charged residue.\n\nComparative conclusion: Introducing a buried charge (Asp) maximally destabilizes the hydrophobic core due to large enthalpic penalties from desolvation and unsatisfied interactions, producing the largest positive $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ and thus the greatest susceptibility to thermally induced misfolding and aggregation. Therefore, the most effective single substitution is Ile87Asp.\n\nHence, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2129379"}, {"introduction": "While single-point mutations can be destabilizing, a protein's tendency to aggregate is often driven by specific short segments known as Aggregation-Prone Regions (APRs).

Conversely, if the native state is unperturbed, $P_{i}$ and $k_{\\text{obs},i}$ remain approximately unchanged and so does $D(t)$.\n\nThe peptide corresponding to residues 88–102 is a solvent-exposed loop in the native structure. In the control condition at pH 7.4, it incorporates a high number of deuterons (9.60 after the 10-minute exchange), consistent with high solvent accessibility and modest protection in the native ensemble. With Inhibitor A, the uptake drops markedly to 3.12 deuterons. Using the relation above, this large decrease in $D(t)$ implies a substantial decrease in the ensemble-averaged $k_{\\text{obs},i}$ values across the peptide, which corresponds to a significant increase in protection factors $\\{P_{i}\\}$ and/or reduced local opening fluctuations. Such a change is the hallmark of an inhibitor that binds to and stabilizes the native state (Mechanism 1), either by directly occluding the loop or by allosterically rigidifying it, thereby shifting the equilibrium away from aggregation-prone partially unfolded conformations.\n\nWith Inhibitor B, the uptake is 9.51 deuterons, essentially indistinguishable from the control (9.60). Under saturating inhibitor at pH 7.4 where the protein is natively folded, unchanged $D(t)$ indicates that $k_{\\text{obs},i}$ and thus the native-state protection factors for this peptide are unaffected. This observation is inconsistent with a native-state stabilization mechanism, which would predict reduced exchange (increased protection) upon binding. Because Thioflavin T kinetics show that Inhibitor B is effective at preventing aggregation, the most plausible mechanism that reconciles prevention of aggregation with unchanged native-state HDX is selective binding to the aggregation-prone intermediate (Mechanism 2), which is not significantly populated under the HDX conditions and therefore does not alter the native-state HDX pattern.\n\nTherefore, Inhibitor A acts via native-state stabilization, while Inhibitor B acts via intermediate sequestration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2129343"}]}
