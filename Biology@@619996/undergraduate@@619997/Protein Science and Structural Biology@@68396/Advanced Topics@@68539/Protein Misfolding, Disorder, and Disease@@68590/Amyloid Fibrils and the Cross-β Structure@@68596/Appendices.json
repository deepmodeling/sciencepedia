By analyzing these sequences, you will develop an intuition for identifying aggregation-prone regions within proteins [@problem_id:2098268].", "problem": "A team of bioengineers is computationally screening short hexapeptides (peptides made of six amino acids) for their potential to self-assemble into stable β-sheet-rich nanofibrils, a key characteristic of amyloid structures. For a peptide sequence to be a good candidate for forming such fibrils, it is predicted that its core region must be predominantly composed of amino acids that are both highly hydrophobic and have a strong propensity to form β-sheets, while avoiding residues that would introduce electrostatic repulsion or disrupt a regular β-strand conformation.\n\nYou are given a table classifying the 20 standard amino acids based on their side-chain properties at physiological pH (approximately 7.4).\n\n-   **Hydrophobic (Nonpolar):** Alanine (A), Valine (V), Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Phenylalanine (F), Tryptophan (W), Methionine (M), Glycine (G)\n-   **Polar (Uncharged):** Serine (S), Threonine (T), Cysteine (C), Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q), Tyrosine (Y)\n-   **Negatively Charged (Acidic):** Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E)\n-   **Positively Charged (Basic):** Lysine (K), Arginine (R), Histidine (H)\n-   **Special Conformation:** Proline (P) (known to break β-sheet structures)\n\nBased on these principles and the provided information, analyze the following hexapeptide sequences.

F-V-I-W-L-V: All six residues (F, V, I, W, L, V) are hydrophobic. Several (V, I, L, F, W) are well known for high β-sheet propensity. There are no charged residues and no prolines. This sequence optimally matches the criteria for forming a hydrophobic, β-sheet-prone core, favoring amyloid-like fibril formation.\n- B. P-G-V-P-G-V: Contains two prolines (P), which disrupt β-sheet structure; glycine (G) adds flexibility that further destabilizes regular β-strands. Despite some hydrophobic content (V), the presence of P makes this sequence unlikely to form stable amyloid-like fibrils.\n- C. D-E-R-K-H-E: Composed largely of charged residues (D, E, R, K, H). Such sequences are highly solvated and subject to electrostatic interactions that disfavor tight hydrophobic packing and stable β-sheet assembly, making amyloid formation unlikely.\n- D. S-T-Q-N-Y-S: Predominantly polar uncharged residues (S, T, Q, N) and Y, which, while aromatic, is polar; overall this reduces hydrophobic driving force and is less favorable for β-sheet-rich fibril cores compared to a strongly hydrophobic sequence.\n\nTherefore, sequence A best satisfies the hydrophobicity and β-sheet propensity criteria while avoiding charged and β-breaking residues, making it the most likely to form amyloid-like fibrils.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2098268"}, {"introduction": "Once an amyloid-prone sequence is identified, a key question is what forces drive its assembly and stabilize the final fibril structure. This practice explores the critical balance between the hydrophobic effect and electrostatic interactions in a thought experiment [@problem_id:2098242].

The formation of these fibrils is associated with numerous human diseases. A key driving force for fibril assembly is the hydrophobic effect, which promotes the packing of nonpolar amino acid side chains into a stable core, shielded from water.\n\nConsider a hypothetical heptapeptide with the sequence $\\text{NH}_2\\text{-Val-Ala-Ile-Phe-Met-Ala-Cys-COOH}$. Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) and with mild agitation, this peptide is known to readily form stable amyloid fibrils. A researcher decides to investigate the role of the central hydrophobic core by creating a mutant version of this peptide. In the mutant peptide, the Phenylalanine (Phe) at position 4 is replaced by an Arginine (Arg).\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of protein structure and stability, what is the most likely effect of this Phe-to-Arg mutation on the peptide's propensity to form amyloid fibrils under the same physiological conditions?\n\nA.

The peptide will form fibrils that are more stable and more resistant to chemical denaturation than the original fibrils.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of mutating a central hydrophobic residue (Phenylalanine) to a bulky, positively charged residue (Arginine) within an amyloid-forming peptide. To solve this, we must analyze the key interactions that stabilize the amyloid fibril structure and how the mutation alters them.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure and stability of the original (wild-type) fibril.**\nThe original peptide has the sequence $\\text{NH}_2\\text{-Val-Ala-Ile-Phe-Met-Ala-Cys-COOH}$. The core of this sequence, particularly residues like Valine (Val), Isoleucine (Ile), Phenylalanine (Phe), and Methionine (Met), consists of amino acids with nonpolar, hydrophobic side chains. Amyloid fibrils are stabilized by the formation of a cross-β structure. In this arrangement, individual peptide molecules form β-strands, which then align to form extended β-sheets. These sheets stack on top of one another to form the fibril. A major thermodynamic driving force for this process is the hydrophobic effect. The nonpolar side chains from the different peptide layers pack tightly together in the core of the fibril, expelling water molecules. This burial of hydrophobic surfaces from the aqueous solvent is energetically favorable and provides a significant portion of the fibril's stability. The Phenylalanine residue, with its large, aromatic side chain, is a major contributor to this hydrophobic core.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the properties of the mutation.**\nThe mutation replaces Phenylalanine (Phe) with Arginine (Arg) at position 4. Let's compare the side chains of these two amino acids.\n- **Phenylalanine (Phe):** Has a benzyl side chain (-CH₂-C₆H₅). It is large, aromatic, and strongly hydrophobic.\n- **Arginine (Arg):** Has a long side chain ending in a guanidinium group (- (CH₂)₃-NH-C(=NH₂⁺)-NH₂). At physiological pH (7.4), this group is protonated and carries a permanent positive charge. The side chain is large, bulky, and hydrophilic.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the consequences of the Phe-to-Arg mutation on fibril stability.**\nThe substitution of a core hydrophobic residue with a charged, hydrophilic one has two primary destabilizing consequences for the cross-β structure:\n\n1.  **Disruption of the Hydrophobic Core:** The formation of a stable amyloid fibril relies on the favorable packing of nonpolar side chains. Introducing a hydrophilic, charged Arginine side chain into this nonpolar environment is energetically highly unfavorable. It is analogous to trying to force a charged group into an oily, nonpolar solvent. This disrupts the tight, efficient packing of the hydrophobic core that stabilizes the fibril.\n\n2.  **Introduction of Electrostatic Repulsion:** As the mutant peptides attempt to stack into the fibril's layered β-sheet structure, the positively charged Arginine side chains from adjacent layers will be brought into close proximity. This will result in strong electrostatic repulsion (Coulombic repulsion) between the like charges. This repulsive force actively works against the association of peptide chains, destabilizing the ordered, compact fibril structure.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the overall effect and evaluate the given options.**\nThe combination of disrupting the essential hydrophobic core and introducing strong electrostatic repulsion makes the formation of the ordered fibril structure energetically unfavorable. Therefore, the mutant peptide will have a much lower tendency, or propensity, to assemble into amyloid fibrils compared to the original peptide.\n\nLet's review the options:\n- **A. The propensity to form amyloid fibrils will be significantly reduced.** This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The mutation introduces destabilizing forces that oppose fibril formation. This is the correct answer.\n- **B. The propensity to form amyloid fibrils will be significantly increased.** This is incorrect. The mutation is destabilizing, not stabilizing.\n- **C. The mutation will have no discernible effect on the rate or extent of fibril formation.** This is incorrect. The chemical properties of the side chains are fundamentally different, and this will have a profound impact on the intermolecular interactions required for assembly.\n- **D. The peptide will form fibrils that are more stable and more resistant to chemical denaturation than the original fibrils.** This is incorrect. The new interactions are unfavorable, leading to a much less stable structure, if one forms at all. The fibril would be less resistant to denaturation, not more.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2098242"}, {"introduction": "In real-world biology, amyloid-forming segments are often just one part of a large, multi-domain protein.

The full-length NAF protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of 750 amino acid residues. For calculation purposes, you may assume the average mass of a single amino acid residue is 115 Daltons (Da).\n\nTo identify the region of the NAF protein that forms the stable, a researcher performs a limited proteolysis experiment. The NAF fibrils are treated with a protease, which digests the flexible, unstructured parts of the protein while leaving the tightly packed fibril core intact. After digestion, the stable fibrillar material is isolated and denatured, and its constituent polypeptide fragment is analyzed using Mass Spectrometry (MS). This analysis reveals a single dominant fragment with a mass of 20.70 kilodaltons (kDa).\n\nTo map the location of this fragment within the original 750-residue sequence, two additional constructs are created and subjected to the same experimental procedure:\n1.  An N-terminally tagged NAF (N-NAF), where a tag with a mass of 12.00 kDa is fused to the N-terminus of the full-length protein. Proteolysis of N-NAF fibrils followed by MS analysis yields a dominant fragment of 32.70 kDa.\n2.
