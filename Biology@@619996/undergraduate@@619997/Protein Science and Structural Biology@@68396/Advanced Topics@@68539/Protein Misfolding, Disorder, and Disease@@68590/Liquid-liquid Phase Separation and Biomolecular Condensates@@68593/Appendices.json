[@problem_id:2117030]", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a newly discovered protein named 'Coacervin'. This protein is composed of two distinct intrinsically disordered domains: one is a poly-cationic domain rich in positively charged arginine residues, and the other is a poly-anionic domain rich in negatively charged glutamate residues. When Coacervin is placed in a buffer solution with a low salt concentration (10 mM KCl), it spontaneously undergoes Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) to form stable, spherical biomolecular condensates. A researcher then performs an experiment where the concentration of KCl in the buffer is significantly increased to 1 M, while all other conditions, such as protein concentration, pH, and temperature, are held constant.\n\nBased on the described molecular architecture of Coacervin and the fundamental principles governing protein interactions, what is the most probable observation after the addition of the high concentration of salt?\n\nA. The condensates will increase in size and fuse together more readily.\n\nB. The condensates will solidify into an irreversible gel-like state.\n\nC. The condensates will dissolve, resulting in a single, homogeneous solution.\n\nD. The condensates will remain completely unchanged in size, number, and appearance.\n\nE. The condensates will shrink in size but increase in number, keeping the total phase-separated volume constant.", "solution": "The problem describes a protein, Coacervin, that forms biomolecular condensates through Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS). The driving force for this phase separation is explicitly linked to the protein's structure: it possesses a poly-cationic domain (rich in positive charges) and a poly-anionic domain (rich in negative charges). The formation of condensates is therefore primarily stabilized by electrostatic attractions between the oppositely charged regions on different Coacervin molecules.\n\nThe experiment involves a significant increase in the salt (KCl) concentration of the solution. In an aqueous solution, KCl, an ionic salt, dissociates into potassium cations ($K^{+}$) and chloride anions ($Cl^{-}$). These mobile ions permeate the solution and interact with the charged residues on the Coacervin protein.\n\nThe core physical principle at play is electrostatic screening, also known as the Debye screening effect. The dissociated salt ions form a 'cloud' of counter-ions around the charged domains of the protein. Specifically, the negative chloride anions ($Cl^{-}$) will preferentially accumulate around the positively charged poly-cationic arginine domains, while the positive potassium cations ($K^{+}$) will accumulate around the negatively charged poly-anionic glutamate domains.\n\nThis cloud of counter-ions effectively neutralizes, or \"screens,\" the electrostatic charges on the protein domains. The presence of the salt ions weakens the long-range electrostatic attraction between the poly-cationic domain of one Coacervin molecule and the poly-anionic domain of another. Since this electrostatic attraction is the primary interaction holding the condensate together, weakening it destabilizes the phase-separated state.\n\nWhen the salt concentration is increased to a high level (1 M), the screening effect becomes very strong. The attractive forces between Coacervin molecules are reduced to a point where they are no longer sufficient to overcome the entropic cost of demixing. Consequently, the system favors a mixed state over a phase-separated one. The condensates will dissolve back into the bulk solution, resulting in a single, homogeneous phase where the protein molecules are uniformly distributed.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Increasing size would imply stronger attractions, which is the opposite of the effect of salt screening.\nB. Solidification is a different phase transition, not the direct consequence of weakening the transient electrostatic interactions that define LLPS.\nC. Dissolution is the direct consequence of weakening the attractive forces that drive phase separation. This is the correct outcome.\nD. No change is incorrect because a significant change in ionic strength will always have a major impact on dominant electrostatic interactions.\nE. Shrinking but increasing in number is not the expected behavior. This might suggest the formation of smaller, more numerous nucleation sites, but the overall effect of charge screening is to raise the saturation concentration required for LLPS, which leads to dissolution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2117030"}, {"introduction": "Beyond passive environmental influences, cells actively regulate condensate formation and dissolution using sophisticated biochemical tools. This problem introduces post-translational modifications (PTMs) as a key regulatory mechanism, focusing on how phosphorylation can alter the delicate cation-$\\pi$ interactions that drive phase separation. Working through this scenario will help you appreciate how a single chemical modification can act as a molecular switch to control biological organization. [@problem_id:2116975]", "problem": "A hypothetical protein, named \"Assemblin,\" plays a crucial role in cellular organization by undergoing Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS). This process is driven by its Intrinsically Disordered Region (IDR), a segment of the protein that lacks a stable three-dimensional structure. The IDR of Assemblin is notably rich in two types of amino acid residues: arginine, which has a positively charged side chain (a cation), and tyrosine, which has an aromatic side chain with an electron-rich pi ($\\pi$) system. The multivalent cation-$\\pi$ interactions between these many arginine and tyrosine residues are the primary driving force for Assemblin to demix from the cytoplasm and form dense, liquid-like biomolecular condensates.\n\nA cell can regulate this process through Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs). Consider a scenario where a specific kinase enzyme becomes active and phosphorylates every serine residue located within Assemblin's IDR. Phosphorylation is the addition of a bulky, negatively charged phosphate group to an amino acid.\n\nBased on the principles of intermolecular forces, what is the most likely effect of this widespread serine phosphorylation on the ability of Assemblin to undergo LLPS?\n\nA. Phase separation will be enhanced, as the newly introduced phosphate groups will form strong salt bridges with the cationic arginine residues, creating a more stable and extensive interaction network.\n\nB. Phase separation will be unaffected, as the serine residues are not directly involved in the cation-$\\pi$ interactions and their modification only alters the surface charge of the folded protein core.\n\nC. The protein will transition from forming reversible liquid-like condensates to forming solid, irreversible aggregates due to uncontrolled electrostatic cross-linking.\n\nD. Phase separation will be inhibited, as the introduced negative charges will create electrostatic repulsion with the electron-rich $\\pi$ systems of the tyrosine residues, weakening the net attractive forces required for condensation.", "solution": "The driving force for Assemblin’s LLPS is multivalent cation-$\\pi$ interactions between positively charged arginine side chains and the electron-rich $\\pi$ systems of tyrosine rings. Such cation-$\\pi$ attractions are favorable electrostatic interactions between a cation and the quadrupole moment of an aromatic ring; when repeated across many sites in an IDR, they form a percolated network that promotes demixing and liquid-like condensation.\n\nPhosphorylation of serine residues in the IDR introduces bulky, negatively charged phosphate groups throughout the same disordered segment that mediates LLPS. The consequences for the interaction network are as follows, based on intermolecular force principles:\n1) Competitive binding to arginine: The phosphate groups, being anionic, form strong ion pairs (salt bridges) with cationic arginine side chains. These interactions directly compete with and sequester arginine away from participating in cation-$\\pi$ interactions with tyrosine. Reducing the effective number of cation-$\\pi$ contacts lowers multivalent connectivity, thereby disfavoring phase separation.\n2) Electrostatic repulsion and solvation: The added negative charges increase the net polyanionic character of the IDR, enhancing intrachain and interchain electrostatic repulsion among phosphates and increasing favorable interactions with solvent. This expands the chain and raises the saturation concentration for phase separation, again inhibiting LLPS.\n3) Lack of stabilizing anion-$\\pi$ interactions with tyrosine: Tyrosine’s aromatic ring is electron-rich; anions generally do not form favorable anion-$\\pi$ interactions with electron-rich rings. Thus, phosphate groups do not create new stabilizing contacts with tyrosine that could replace or enhance the original cation-$\\pi$ network.\n4) Material state considerations: While arginine-phosphate ion pairs are strong, widespread phosphorylation in IDRs typically reduces, rather than rigidifies, the multivalent network that previously relied on cation-$\\pi$ contacts, making a transition to solid, irreversible aggregates unlikely under the stated mechanism.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because forming arginine-phosphate salt bridges diverts arginine from cation-$\\pi$ interactions with tyrosine and reduces the primary attractive network driving LLPS, thereby not enhancing phase separation.\n- B is incorrect because the modifications occur in the IDR that directly mediates LLPS; altering its charge pattern strongly affects phase behavior.\n- C is unlikely because such phosphorylation more commonly solubilizes and inhibits LLPS rather than generating irreversible, solid aggregates through uncontrolled cross-linking.\n- D is correct in its net prediction of inhibited phase separation; although the most direct mechanism is competition for arginine and increased electrostatic repulsion/solvation, the statement correctly identifies that the modifications weaken the net attractive forces required for condensation rather than creating new stabilizing interactions.\n\nTherefore, widespread serine phosphorylation in the IDR is most likely to inhibit Assemblin’s ability to undergo LLPS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2116975"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the forces that drive and regulate phase separation, we now turn to a design challenge that integrates these concepts.
