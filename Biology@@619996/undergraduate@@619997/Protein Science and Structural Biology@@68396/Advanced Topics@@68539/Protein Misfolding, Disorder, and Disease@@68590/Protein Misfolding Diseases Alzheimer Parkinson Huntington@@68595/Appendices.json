This practice explores a crucial concept in Familial Alzheimer's Disease, where the \"how\" is more important than the \"how much.\" You will apply your knowledge to deduce how a specific genetic mutation in the enzyme γ-secretase alters its function, not by simply increasing or decreasing its overall activity, but by changing the ratio of its products and triggering pathology. [@problem_id:2129514]", "problem": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain. These plaques are primarily composed of aggregated Amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides. The Aβ peptide is a product of the sequential proteolytic cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), a transmembrane protein. The first cleavage is performed by β-secretase. The second and final cleavage is performed by an enzyme complex called γ-secretase, which cleaves the remaining fragment within its transmembrane domain.\n\nA crucial feature of γ-secretase is its imprecise cleavage, leading to the production of Aβ peptides of several different lengths. The two major species produced are a 40-amino-acid peptide (Aβ40) and a 42-amino-acid peptide (Aβ42). While Aβ40 is more abundant, Aβ42 is significantly more hydrophobic and prone to aggregation, and it is considered the primary pathogenic species initiating plaque formation.\n\nCertain rare, aggressive, early-onset forms of the disease are known as Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD). Many FAD cases are linked to autosomal dominant mutations in the *PSEN1* gene, which codes for the Presenilin-1 protein. Presenilin-1 is the catalytic core of the γ-secretase enzyme complex.\n\nGiven this background, what is the most likely biochemical consequence of a pathogenic FAD-associated mutation in Presenilin-1 on the relative production of the two main Aβ peptides?\n\nA. A significant increase in the total production of both Aβ40 and Aβ42, while the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 remains constant.\n\nB. A significant decrease in the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40.\n\nC. A complete inhibition of γ-secretase activity, leading to a halt in the production of both Aβ40 and Aβ42.\n\nD. A significant increase in the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40.\n\nE. The exclusive production of Aβ40, with no Aβ42 being formed.", "solution": "We proceed by explicit biochemical reasoning.\n\n1. γ-secretase cleaves the transmembrane fragment of APP imprecisely, generating multiple peptide lengths, with the two predominant products being $A\\beta_{40}$ and $A\\beta_{42}$. Among these, $A\\beta_{42}$ is more hydrophobic and aggregation-prone, and is more strongly implicated in plaque nucleation.\n\n2. Presenilin-1 is the catalytic core of γ-secretase; thus, mutations in the PSEN1 gene can alter the enzyme’s cleavage specificity and processivity. Familial Alzheimer’s Disease (FAD)-associated PSEN1 mutations characteristically shift the pattern of intramembrane cleavages toward longer $A\\beta$ species.\n\n3. Let the relative production be expressed as the ratio\n$$\nR=\\frac{[A\\beta_{42}]}{[A\\beta_{40}]}.\n$$\nFAD-associated PSEN1 mutations typically increase $R$ by elevating $[A\\beta_{42}]$ relative to $[A\\beta_{40}]$, often even when the total $A\\beta$ output is unchanged or reduced. The key pathogenic consequence is the shift toward the longer, aggregation-prone $A\\beta_{42}$ species, not a uniform increase in both products nor a complete loss of activity.\n\n4. Option analysis:\n- A is inconsistent because the hallmark is a change in proportion (an increased $R$), not a constant ratio with uniform increases.\n- B is the opposite of the established effect; $R$ does not decrease.\n- C is not typical of FAD mutations; complete inhibition of γ-secretase is not the usual pathogenic mechanism and would have broader deleterious developmental consequences.\n- D reflects the canonical effect: an increased $A\\beta_{42}$ to $A\\beta_{40}$ ratio.\n- E contradicts the observed shift toward $A\\beta_{42}$; exclusive $A\\beta_{40}$ production is not the pathogenic signature.\n\nTherefore, the most likely biochemical consequence is an increase in the ratio $[A\\beta_{42}]/[A\\beta_{40}]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2129514"}, {"introduction": "The link between a genetic mutation and its biochemical consequence can often be described mathematically. In Huntington's Disease, the severity is directly tied to the length of a polyglutamine repeat in the huntingtin protein. This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to use a quantitative model to predict the aggregation rate constant, translating a specific genetic detail—the number of repeats—into a tangible kinetic parameter. [@problem_id:2129513]", "problem": "Huntington's Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. This mutation involves an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat, which results in a protein with an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract. The length of this polyQ tract, denoted by $N$, directly correlates with the protein's propensity to misfold and form toxic aggregates.\n\nA simplified kinetic model describes the aggregation rate constant, $k_{agg}$, for the huntingtin protein as a function of the polyQ tract length $N$. According to this model, aggregation is negligible for proteins with a polyQ length up to a critical threshold, $N_c = 36$.

[@problem_id:2129497]", "problem": "A team of biochemists is investigating a potential therapeutic agent, codenamed Compound-Z, for its ability to inhibit the aggregation of the α-synuclein protein. The misfolding and oligomerization of α-synuclein are central to the pathology of Parkinson's disease. The monomeric form of human α-synuclein has a molecular weight of approximately 14.5 kDa.\n\nTo test Compound-Z, the researchers set up an in-vitro experiment. They prepared four different samples and incubated them under conditions known to promote α-synuclein oligomerization. After incubation, the samples were treated with a denaturing agent and analyzed using Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by a protein-specific staining method. SDS-PAGE is a technique that separates proteins primarily based on their molecular weight, with smaller proteins migrating further down the gel than larger ones.\n\nThe contents of the four lanes on the gel were as follows:\n- **Lane 1:** A molecular weight marker, which provides a reference ladder of known protein sizes.\n- **Lane 2:** α-synuclein protein alone.\n- **Lane 3:** α-synuclein protein incubated with Compound-Z.\n- **Lane 4:** Compound-Z alone.\n\nUpon visualizing the stained gel, the researchers observed the following results:\n- **Lane 1:** Displayed a clear ladder a of bands corresponding to known molecular weights.\n- **Lane 2:** Showed a prominent band at ~14.5 kDa, a distinct band at ~29 kDa, and a fainter band at ~43.5 kDa.\n- **Lane 3:** Showed only a single, strong band at ~14.5 kDa.\n- **Lane 4:** Showed no visible bands in the entire lane.\n\nBased on this experimental evidence, what is the most logical conclusion about the effect of Compound-Z on α-synuclein?\n\nA.

SDS-PAGE separates proteins primarily by molecular weight after denaturation; species that persist as higher-mass bands following denaturation represent covalent or SDS-resistant oligomers.

Because samples were denatured before SDS-PAGE, the presence of bands at $29$ kDa and $43.5$ kDa indicates that a fraction of α-synuclein formed SDS-resistant oligomers under the incubation conditions; thus, oligomerization occurred in the absence of Compound-Z.\n- Lane 3 (α-synuclein with Compound-Z) shows only a single, strong band at approximately $14.5$ kDa and no bands at higher molecular weights. Under the same incubation and denaturing conditions, the disappearance of oligomer bands implies that oligomer formation was prevented or reduced below detection. Given that Lane 2 demonstrates oligomers persist through denaturation, the most direct interpretation is that Compound-Z inhibits oligomerization.\n- Lane 4 (Compound-Z alone) shows no bands, which is expected because the stain is protein-specific and Compound-Z is not a protein; therefore, the compound itself does not produce bands that could confound interpretation.\n\nEvaluate the answer options in light of these observations:\n- A (inhibits oligomerization): Consistent with the disappearance of the $29$ kDa and $43.5$ kDa bands in Lane 3 compared to Lane 2.\n- B (ineffective): Contradicted by the absence of oligomer bands in Lane 3.\n- C (accelerates oligomerization): Would predict stronger or additional higher-molecular-weight bands in Lane 3, which are not observed.\n- D (causes degradation into smaller fragments): Would produce bands below $14.5$ kDa, which are not observed.\n- E (inconclusive due to Compound-Z degradation): Lane 4’s absence of bands reflects that the stain detects proteins, not small molecules; moreover, Lane 3’s clear monomer-only pattern is interpretable regardless of Compound-Z visibility on the gel.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is that Compound-Z effectively inhibits the oligomerization of α-synuclein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2129497"}]}
