This exercise hones your ability to predict whether a protein segment is likely to be structured or disordered by analyzing its composition. By recognizing the distinct biochemical properties of different amino acids, you can begin to decipher the \"sequence grammar\" that gives rise to the dynamic ensembles characteristic of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) and Intrinsically Disordered Regions (IDRs) [@problem_id:2143981].", "problem": "In the study of protein science, it is understood that the primary sequence of amino acids dictates its three-dimensional structure and, consequently, its function. However, a significant class of proteins, known as Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs), or proteins containing Intrinsically Disordered Regions (IDRs), do not adopt a stable, folded structure under physiological conditions. Instead, they exist as dynamic conformational ensembles. The propensity for a protein segment to be ordered or disordered can often be predicted by analyzing its amino acid composition.\n\nConsider the two following short octapeptides, presented using their standard one-letter codes:\n\n**Peptide 1:** V-L-I-F-A-W-V-L\n**Peptide 2:** G-S-E-P-K-G-A-G\n\nBased on the general biochemical properties of the constituent amino acids, determine which peptide is more likely to be an IDR and the principal reason for this characteristic.\n\nA. Peptide 1, because its high concentration of large, nonpolar side chains promotes the formation of disorganized aggregates rather than a stable fold.\n\nB. Peptide 2, because the repetitive Glycine-Alanine sequence strongly favors the formation of a rigid, stable alpha-helix, which is a form of local order, not global disorder.\n\nC. Peptide 1, because the alternating pattern of Valine and Leucine creates beta-strands that are unable to pack into a stable sheet, leading to disorder.\n\nD. Peptide 2, because its composition is enriched with residues that confer high conformational flexibility (Glycine) and disrupt regular secondary structures (Proline), alongside charged residues that can cause electrostatic repulsion.\n\nE. Both peptides are equally likely to be disordered, as any peptide this short lacks the necessary long-range interactions to form a stable tertiary structure.", "solution": "We aim to decide which peptide has higher intrinsic disorder propensity by applying established composition-based rules for intrinsic disorder. A widely used criterion is that intrinsically disordered regions are enriched in polar and charged residues and depleted in bulky hydrophobic residues. Mechanistically, high net charge density and low hydrophobicity disfavor hydrophobic collapse, while certain residues modulate local backbone conformational preferences: glycine increases conformational flexibility, and proline disrupts regular secondary structures such as alpha-helices and beta-strands.\n\nFirst, analyze Peptide 1 (V-L-I-F-A-W-V-L). Its composition is dominated by hydrophobic side chains: valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan are all large hydrophobes that stabilize folded cores and favor compact structures in aqueous environments. Such sequences are typically order-promoting and, in isolation, may tend toward aggregation rather than remaining as highly solvated, expanded conformational ensembles. Therefore, Peptide 1 is not compositionally characteristic of an intrinsically disordered region.\n\nSecond, analyze Peptide 2 (G-S-E-P-K-G-A-G). This sequence is enriched in disorder-promoting residues: glycine occurs multiple times and increases backbone flexibility; proline is a well-known breaker of regular secondary structures; serine is polar and solvation-favoring; glutamate and lysine introduce charged side chains that increase solvation and can generate electrostatic repulsion, both of which oppose hydrophobic collapse. The overall depletion of bulky hydrophobes (only alanine is nonpolar and small) and the presence of flexible/disruptive residues confer a high intrinsic disorder propensity.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because hydrophobic richness promotes folding or aggregation, not canonical intrinsic disorder.\n- B is incorrect because glycine and proline destabilize alpha-helices rather than strongly favoring a rigid helix.\n- C is incorrect because the proposed alternating valine/leucine rationale for disorder is not supported; these residues are hydrophobic and typically order-promoting.\n- D is correct: it identifies the enrichment in glycine (flexibility), proline (secondary-structure disruption), and charged residues (electrostatic effects) as the principal reasons for disorder.\n- E is incorrect because disorder propensity can be inferred from composition even in short segments; shortness alone does not make peptides equally likely to be disordered.\n\nTherefore, the peptide more likely to be an IDR is Peptide 2, for the reasons stated in option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2143981"}, {"introduction": "The structural flexibility of an IDP has direct consequences for its physical behavior, which we can observe using standard laboratory techniques. This problem explores a classic and somewhat counter-intuitive experimental outcome related to the size of IDPs [@problem_id:2144022]. By considering how a protein's shape affects its journey through a size-exclusion chromatography column, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the large hydrodynamic radius of disordered proteins compared to their compact, globular counterparts.", "problem": "A protein biochemist is studying two different monomeric proteins: Protein G and Protein D. Protein G is a well-characterized enzyme known to adopt a stable, compact globular fold. Protein D is an Intrinsically Disordered Protein (IDP), meaning it lacks a fixed or ordered three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. Remarkably, through mass spectrometry analysis, the researcher confirms that both Protein G and Protein D have the exact same molecular weight of 45.0 kDa.\n\nThe researcher decides to analyze both proteins individually using the same Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) column. The column separates proteins based on their size as they pass through a porous matrix.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of the SEC experiment and provides the correct scientific reasoning?\n\nA. Protein D will elute at a smaller elution volume than Protein G. This is because the disordered nature of Protein D results in a larger average hydrodynamic radius compared to the compact, globular structure of Protein G.\n\nB. Protein G and Protein D will elute at approximately the same volume. This is because size-exclusion chromatography separates proteins primarily based on their molecular weight, which is identical for both proteins.\n\nC. Protein D will elute at a larger elution volume than Protein G. This is because its flexible and unfolded state allows it to penetrate deeper into the pores of the chromatography resin, increasing its path length.\n\nD. Protein D will elute at a smaller elution volume than Protein G. This is because the exposed polar residues on the disordered protein cause it to bind transiently to the column matrix, effectively shortening its path through the column.", "solution": "Size-exclusion chromatography separates solutes by their hydrodynamic size, not directly by molecular weight. The elution behavior is described by the partition coefficient\n$$\nK_{av}=\\frac{V_{e}-V_{0}}{V_{t}-V_{0}},\n$$\nwhere $V_{e}$ is the elution volume, $V_{0}$ is the column void volume, and $V_{t}$ is the total column volume. For a given resin, $K_{av}$ is a decreasing function of the hydrodynamic radius $R_{h}$: larger $R_{h}$ means less pore access and thus smaller $K_{av}$, giving a smaller $V_{e}$ via\n$$\nV_{e}=V_{0}+K_{av}\\left(V_{t}-V_{0}\\right).\n$$\nThe hydrodynamic radius relates to molecular conformation. For polymers of equal chain length (or equal molecular weight), an expanded disordered coil has a larger characteristic size than a compact globule. Using standard polymer scaling, the radius of gyration scales as $R_{g}\\propto N^{\\nu}$ with $\\nu\\approx \\frac{3}{5}$ for a self-avoiding coil and $\\nu\\approx \\frac{1}{3}$ for a compact globule; the hydrodynamic radius $R_{h}$ tracks $R_{g}$ up to a constant factor. Therefore, for equal molecular weight, an intrinsically disordered protein has a larger $R_{h}$ than a compact globular protein.\n\nBecause $R_{h}(\\text{IDP})>R_{h}(\\text{globular})$, it follows that $K_{av}(\\text{IDP})<K_{av}(\\text{globular})$ and hence $V_{e}(\\text{IDP})<V_{e}(\\text{globular})$. Thus the IDP elutes earlier (at a smaller elution volume).\n\nOption B is incorrect because SEC does not separate primarily by molecular weight but by hydrodynamic size. Option C reverses the size relationship; a disordered chain at the same molecular weight is larger on average, not smaller, so it does not penetrate deeper than the globular protein. Option D provides an incorrect mechanism: non-ideal interactions with the matrix, if present, generally increase retention (larger $V_{e}$), and SEC media are designed to minimize such interactions; in any case, the correct reason is the difference in $R_{h}$, not transient binding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2144022"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the properties of individual IDPs allows us to model their roles within complex cellular networks.
