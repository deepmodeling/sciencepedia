Many soluble proteins are rich in hydrophobic amino acids, which they bury in a central core, away from the aqueous cytosol. This exercise [@problem_id:2119247] explores this crucial distinction, forcing you to consider not just the *what* (hydrophobicity) but the *where* (the sequential arrangement of residues), providing insight into the fundamental differences between a protein designed to be soluble and one destined for the membrane.", "problem": "A biochemistry student is tasked with writing a simple computational script to identify potential $\\alpha$-helical transmembrane proteins from a database of protein sequences. The student's logic is based on the principle that transmembrane segments, which span the nonpolar lipid bilayer, must be hydrophobic. The script they design calculates the overall percentage of hydrophobic amino acids (specifically Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Methionine, and Phenylalanine) in an entire protein sequence. If this percentage exceeds a predefined threshold, the protein is flagged as a potential transmembrane protein.\n\nThe student's script analyzes a specific protein, Protein X, and finds that it has a high overall percentage of hydrophobic residues, leading to its classification as a transmembrane protein. However, subsequent laboratory analysis using cell fractionation and spectroscopy conclusively shows that Protein X is a soluble, globular protein that functions exclusively in the aqueous environment of the cytosol.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most crucial and direct explanation for why the student's simple percentage-based method failed to correctly classify Protein X?\n\nA. The script failed to consider that transmembrane $\\alpha$-helices often contain hydrophilic residues like serine or threonine, which are important for helix-helix packing but would lower the overall hydrophobicity score.\nB. The hydrophobic residues in Protein X, while numerous, are likely distributed throughout the sequence and fold to form a stable, central hydrophobic core, which is a characteristic structural feature of soluble globular proteins.\nC. The student's list of hydrophobic amino acids was incomplete; a correct method must also include tryptophan and tyrosine, which have large nonpolar side chains that contribute significantly to hydrophobicity.\nD. The method is only reliable for $\\beta$-barrel transmembrane proteins, as the alternating pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in their $\\beta$-strands gives a distinct signal that is missed in $\\alpha$-helical proteins.", "solution": "The fundamental reason the student's method failed lies in its oversimplification of the principles governing protein structure in different environments. The method correctly identifies that hydrophobicity is important but fails to account for the critical role of amino acid *distribution* along the polypeptide chain.\n\nFirst, let's consider the structure of a soluble, globular protein like Protein X, which exists in the aqueous cytosol. The folding of such proteins is primarily driven by the hydrophobic effect. In an aqueous environment, it is energetically unfavorable for nonpolar (hydrophobic) side chains to be exposed to water molecules. To achieve a stable, low-energy conformation, the protein chain folds in such a way that these hydrophobic residues are buried in the interior of the structure, forming a compact \"hydrophobic core.\" Meanwhile, the polar and charged (hydrophilic) residues remain on the protein's surface, where they can favorably interact with water. Therefore, a high total number of hydrophobic residues is not only possible but is actually a requirement for the formation of a stable, soluble, globular protein.\n\nNext, let's consider the requirements for an $\\alpha$-helical transmembrane domain. A lipid bilayer is a nonpolar environment, essentially the opposite of the cytosol. For a protein segment to be stably embedded within and span this bilayer, it must present a nonpolar surface to the surrounding lipid tails. This is achieved by a continuous, unbroken stretch of predominantly hydrophobic amino acids. For a standard $\\alpha$-helix to span a typical cell membrane (approximately 30 Å thick), this segment needs to be about 18 to 25 residues long.\n\nThe student's method, which calculates only the overall percentage of hydrophobic residues, treats the protein as a \"bag of amino acids\" and is blind to their sequential arrangement. It cannot distinguish between two fundamentally different scenarios:\n1.  Hydrophobic residues scattered throughout the sequence, which will fold to form the core of a soluble protein.\n2.  Hydrophobic residues clustered together into one or more long, continuous segments, which are capable of forming stable transmembrane domains.\n\nProtein X represents the first scenario. It has a high count of hydrophobic residues, but they are arranged in a pattern that allows for the formation of a soluble protein with a hydrophobic core. The student's script produced a false positive because its logic was unable to differentiate this case from a true transmembrane protein.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. This statement is true in a detailed sense; transmembrane helices are not perfectly hydrophobic. However, this is not the *primary* reason the student's method failed. The method's flaw is much more fundamental—it ignores an entire class of proteins (soluble ones) that also have high hydrophobic content. The presence of a few hydrophilic residues in a true transmembrane helix is a secondary detail.\n\nB. This statement correctly identifies the reason for the method's failure. It explains the alternative fate of the numerous hydrophobic residues in Protein X: they form a hydrophobic core, a hallmark of soluble proteins. This directly addresses why a high overall hydrophobicity does not automatically signify a transmembrane protein and explains the existence of the \"false positive\" that the script detected.\n\nC. This is incorrect. While tryptophan and tyrosine are indeed hydrophobic, omitting them from the list is a minor flaw in the implementation, not the core conceptual error. Including them would likely increase the hydrophobicity score for both soluble and membrane proteins, and would not fix the fundamental problem of failing to distinguish between the two based on residue distribution.\n\nD. This statement is factually incorrect. Predicting $\\beta$-barrel transmembrane structures from sequence is significantly more difficult than predicting $\\alpha$-helical ones. This is because $\\beta$-barrels feature an alternating pattern of hydrophobic (facing lipids) and hydrophilic (facing the pore's interior) residues. A simple hydrophobicity-averaging method like the student's would be even less effective for $\\beta$-barrels, as the presence of many hydrophilic residues would likely cause the segment to fail to meet a high hydrophobicity threshold.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2119247"}, {"introduction": "Nature constructs complex multi-pass membrane proteins not with a single master plan, but by embedding a series of \"instructions\"—topogenic signals—along the polypeptide chain.

The student decides to create a chimeric protein by genetically fusing parts of two different single-pass transmembrane proteins, Protein X and Protein Y.\n\nProtein X is a canonical Type II transmembrane protein. This means it has a single transmembrane domain, its N-terminus is located in the cytosol, and its C-terminus is in the ER lumen. Its topology is determined by a non-cleavable signal-anchor (SA-II) sequence that is flanked by a cluster of positively charged amino acid residues on its N-terminal side.\n\nProtein Y is a canonical Type I transmembrane protein. This means it has a single transmembrane domain, its N-terminus is in the ER lumen, and its C-terminus is in the cytosol. Its topology is established by an N-terminal cleavable signal sequence, which is removed after initiating translocation, followed by a stop-transfer anchor (STA) sequence further down the polypeptide chain.\n\nThe student constructs a chimeric gene, `Gene-XY`. This new gene consists of the DNA sequence encoding the N-terminal portion of Protein X (including its entire SA-II sequence) fused in-frame to the DNA sequence of Protein Y. Crucially, the portion of `Gene-Y` used in the fusion is the one that encodes the mature protein, meaning its original N-terminal cleavable signal sequence has been completely replaced by the N-terminal segment of Protein X.\n\nAfter expressing `Gene-XY` in a suitable cell-free translation/translocation system containing microsomes (vesicles derived from the ER), what will be the final membrane topology of the resulting Chimeric Protein XY?\n\n\nA. The protein will have a Type I topology: N-terminus in the ER lumen, C-terminus in the cytosol, and one transmembrane domain.\nB. The protein will have a Type II topology: N-terminus in the cytosol, C-terminus in the ER lumen, and one transmembrane domain.\nC. The protein will be a multi-pass protein with its N-terminus in the cytosol, its C-terminus in the cytosol, and two transmembrane domains.\nD. The protein will be a multi-pass protein with its N-terminus in the ER lumen, its C-terminus in the ER lumen, and two transmembrane domains.\nE. The entire protein will be fully translocated into the ER lumen and exist as a soluble protein, with no transmembrane domains.", "solution": "1) Identify the topogenic elements present in the chimera. By design, the N-terminal portion of Protein X, including its non-cleavable signal-anchor SA-II with an N-terminal cluster of positive charges, is fused directly to the mature region of Protein Y. Protein Y’s original N-terminal cleavable signal sequence is absent, but its downstream stop-transfer anchor (STA) sequence remains in the mature region.\n\n2) State the governing principles for membrane insertion and orientation.\n- The SA-II (internal signal-anchor) initiates SRP-dependent targeting to the ER translocon and is integrated into the membrane as a transmembrane helix.\n- The “positive-inside” rule dictates that the side of the transmembrane segment with more positive charges remains on the cytosolic side. For SA-II flanked by N-terminal positive charges, the N-terminus remains cytosolic and the C-terminus is translocated into the ER lumen.\n- An STA halts further translocation through the translocon and becomes a transmembrane segment; residues synthesized after the STA remain on the cytosolic side. Orientation around the STA is stabilized by charge bias, typically placing its C-terminal side in the cytosol for a canonical Type I context.\n\n3) Apply these principles to the chimera’s first topogenic signal (the SA-II from Protein X).\n- The SA-II targets the ribosome–nascent chain to the ER and integrates such that the N-terminus (bearing the positive charges) remains in the cytosol and the downstream polypeptide segment enters the ER lumen. Therefore, after insertion of this first transmembrane helix, the topology is: N-terminus in cytosol, segment beyond the SA-II in lumen.\n\n4) Follow the nascent chain past the SA-II into the Protein Y region until the STA is encountered.\n- As translation proceeds, the polypeptide emerging after the SA-II moves through the translocon into the ER lumen until the STA of the Y region is synthesized and engages the translocon.\n- The STA stops further translocation and laterally partitions into the membrane as a second transmembrane helix. By the standard orientation for an STA in a Type I context, and consistent with the positive-inside rule acting on its C-terminal side, the C-terminal side of this STA remains in the cytosol.\n\n5) Conclude the overall topology.\n- First membrane span: SA-II from X, oriented N_cyt/C_lum.\n- Second membrane span: STA from Y, which stops transfer and places the remainder of the chain in the cytosol.\n- Net result: two transmembrane domains; the N-terminus is in the cytosol (set by SA-II), there is a luminal loop between the two helices, and the C-terminus is in the cytosol (set by the STA).\n\n6) Exclude alternative answers.\n- A (Type I single-pass) is not possible because the N-terminal cleavable signal sequence is absent and the first determinant is an SA-II that enforces N_cyt/C_lum orientation; additionally, the retained STA would introduce a second membrane span.\n- B (Type II single-pass) would ignore the downstream STA; since the STA is present, a second membrane insertion occurs, yielding two passes.\n- D (two-pass with both ends luminal) contradicts the positive-inside rule and the established orientations of SA-II and STA here.\n- E (soluble luminal protein) is impossible because the SA-II is non-cleavable and integrates as a membrane anchor.\n\nTherefore, the chimeric protein is a multi-pass protein with N-terminus in the cytosol, C-terminus in the cytosol, and two transmembrane domains.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2119278"}]}
