A positive index indicates a hydrophobic (water-fearing) region, which is likely to be embedded within a cell membrane, while a negative index indicates a hydrophilic (water-loving) region.\n\nA continuous stretch of amino acids is considered a transmembrane domain if it meets two specific criteria:\n1.

The specific non-covalent interactions within this pocket determine a drug's affinity and specificity. This problem challenges you to deduce these critical interactions by analyzing precise structural data, much like a medicinal chemist would, to understand how a ligand like carazolol is anchored within the $\\beta_2$-adrenergic receptor [@problem_id:2139663].", "problem": "The $\\beta_2$-adrenergic receptor ($\\beta_2$AR) is a classic example of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and the target of many drugs used to treat conditions like asthma and high blood pressure. Its function is modulated by ligands binding to a cavity known as the orthosteric pocket, which is formed by several transmembrane (TM) helices.\n\nConsider the binding of the inverse agonist carazolol to the $\\beta_2$AR. Carazolol possesses three key chemical features relevant for its interaction: a bulky, aromatic carbazole group; a secondary amine group, which is protonated at physiological pH; and a hydroxyl group. An analysis of the receptor-ligand complex provides the following information about specific amino acid residues in the binding pocket. For reference, a typical hydrogen bond is characterized by a donor-acceptor distance of approximately 2.7 to 3.3 Ångstroms.\n\n- **Aspartic Acid 113 (Asp113)**, an acidic residue in TM3: The distance from an oxygen atom of its side-chain carboxylate group to the nitrogen atom of carazolol's amine is 2.8 Å.\n- **Valine 114 (Val114)**, a non-polar aliphatic residue in TM3: The shortest distance from its side chain to the carbazole ring of carazolol is 4.5 Å.\n- **Serine 204 (Ser204)**, a polar residue in TM5: The distance from the oxygen atom of its side-chain hydroxyl group to the oxygen atom of carazolol's hydroxyl group is 2.9 Å.\n- **Phenylalanine 290 (Phe290)**, an aromatic non-polar residue in TM7: The distance between the center of its side-chain phenyl ring and the center of carazolol's carbazole ring system is 3.8 Å.\n- **Lysine 305 (Lys305)**, a basic residue in TM7: The distance from its side-chain amine nitrogen to carazolol's hydroxyl oxygen is 6.5 Å.\n\nBased on this information and your knowledge of amino acid properties and non-covalent interactions, determine the triplet of residues that provides the primary anchoring interactions for carazolol.

We need to find one residue for each interaction type: (1) an ionic interaction with the protonated amine, (2) a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group, and (3) a hydrophobic/aromatic interaction with the carbazole ring.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the residue for the ionic interaction.**\nThe ligand carazolol has a secondary amine which is protonated at physiological pH, giving it a positive charge ($-\\text{NH}_2^+-$). This positive charge will form a strong electrostatic interaction, often called a salt bridge or a charge-assisted hydrogen bond, with a negatively charged amino acid residue. Negatively charged (acidic) residues are Aspartic Acid (Asp) and Glutamic Acid (Glu).\n\n- We look at the provided list for acidic residues. Aspartic Acid 113 (Asp113) is an acidic residue.\n- The problem states that the distance between an oxygen atom on Asp113's side-chain carboxylate ($-\\text{COO}^-$) and the nitrogen atom of carazolol's amine is 2.8 Å. This distance is well within the range for a strong hydrogen bond, and the opposite charges make this a favorable ionic interaction.\n- Lysine 305 (Lys305) is a basic residue, which would be positively charged at physiological pH and would electrostatically repel the positively charged amine of carazolol.\n- Therefore, **Asp113** is the residue responsible for the ionic interaction.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the residue for the hydrogen bond.**\nThe ligand carazolol has a hydroxyl ($-\\text{OH}$) group. This group can act as a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor. We need to find a suitable polar residue that is close enough to form a hydrogen bond. The problem specifies a typical H-bond distance is 2.7-3.3 Å.\n\n- We look for polar residues in the list. Serine 204 (Ser204) is a polar residue with a side-chain hydroxyl group ($-\\text{OH}$).\n- The problem states that the distance between the hydroxyl oxygen of Ser204 and the hydroxyl oxygen of carazolol is 2.9 Å. This distance is squarely in the middle of the specified range for a hydrogen bond.\n- The other potential hydrogen bonding residue, Lysine 305, is noted to be 6.5 Å away, which is far too distant to form a hydrogen bond.\n- Therefore, **Serine 204** is the residue that forms a hydrogen bond with carazolol's hydroxyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the residue for the hydrophobic/aromatic interaction.**\nThe ligand carazolol has a large, planar, aromatic carbazole group. This moiety will participate in hydrophobic interactions, and specifically, can form favorable $\\pi$-stacking interactions with aromatic amino acid residues (Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Tryptophan).\n\n- We look for non-polar, and ideally aromatic, residues in the list. Phenylalanine 290 (Phe290) is an aromatic, non-polar residue.\n- The problem states that the distance between the center of its phenyl ring and the center of carazolol's carbazole ring is 3.8 Å. This distance is characteristic of a stabilizing $\\pi$-stacking interaction between two aromatic systems.\n- Valine 114 (Val114) is also a non-polar (hydrophobic) residue. However, it is aliphatic, not aromatic, so it cannot form a $\\pi$-stacking interaction. While it can contribute to the overall hydrophobic environment, the interaction with Phe290 is more specific and stronger. Furthermore, its distance of 4.5 Å suggests a weaker van der Waals contact compared to the one involving Phe290.\n- Therefore, **Phenylalanine 290** is the residue responsible for the key hydrophobic/aromatic interaction.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and select the correct option.**\nWe have identified the three residues and their corresponding interactions:\n1.  Ionic interaction: **Asp113**\n2.  Hydrogen bond: **Ser204**\n3.  Hydrophobic/aromatic interaction: **Phe290**\n\nThe question asks for the triplet of residues in this specific order. The correct triplet is (Asp113, Ser204, Phe290). We now check the given multiple-choice options.\n\n- A. Asp113, Ser204, Phe290\n- B. Lys305, Val114, Phe290\n- C. Asp113, Lys305, Val114\n- D.

Liganol contains a central phenyl ring, and its C4 carbon atom has been identified as a suitable attachment point for chemical modification without disrupting the primary binding interactions. This C4 atom is located at the origin of our coordinate system, `(0, 0, 0)`.\n\nThe goal is to convert Liganol into a targeted covalent inhibitor by adding a reactive chemical moiety that will form an irreversible bond with a nearby cysteine residue.

A core principle in designing targeted covalent inhibitors is to select a non-essential residue to avoid disrupting the receptor's fundamental structure and function. The problem provides two options: `Cys150` and `Cys300`. `Cys300` is described as part of the \"highly conserved `NPxxY` motif, which is known to be absolutely critical for G-protein coupling and signal transduction.\" Targeting this residue would likely abrogate the receptor's essential function, making it an unsuitable choice for developing a specific inhibitor. In contrast, `Cys150` is located on a \"relatively flexible and non-conserved\" extracellular loop. This description implies that it is not critical for the overall fold or function of the receptor, making it an ideal candidate for targeted modification. Therefore, we select `Cys150` as the target. This eliminates options B and E.\n\nSecond, we must select the appropriate reactive group. The problem specifies that the bond should be formed via a Michael addition reaction with the cysteine's thiol group ($-\\text{SH}$). The thiol group is a soft nucleophile. A Michael addition involves the nucleophilic attack on an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n- An `acrylamide` group contains a carbon-carbon double bond conjugated to a carbonyl group, making it an excellent Michael acceptor. The nucleophilic sulfur of the cysteine can attack the β-carbon of the acrylamide to form a stable, irreversible thioether bond.\n- An `aldehyde` group is primarily reactive toward nucleophilic amines (e.g., from lysine residues) to form a Schiff base. Its reaction with a thiol forms a hemithioacetal, which is typically reversible and not the intended stable covalent bond formation mechanism described.\nThus, the `acrylamide` group is the correct choice for the specified reaction type. This eliminates option C.\n\nThird, we calculate the straight-line distance between the ligand's attachment point and the target atom. The attachment point on Liganol is the C4 atom at `P₁ = (0, 0, 0)` Ångstroms. The target atom is the sulfur (`Sγ`) of `Cys150` at `P₂ = (4.0, 2.0, 1.0)` Ångstroms.
