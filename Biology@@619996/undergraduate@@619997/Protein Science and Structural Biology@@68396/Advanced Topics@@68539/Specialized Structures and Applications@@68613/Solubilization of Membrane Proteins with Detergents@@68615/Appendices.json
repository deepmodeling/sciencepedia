This practice challenges you to visualize this process by predicting the changes in a particle size distribution curve measured by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) at key stages of detergent titration. Developing this mental model is crucial for interpreting experimental data and understanding the physical mechanism of membrane disruption.

The resulting proteoliposomes are monodisperse, and an initial Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) experiment on the aqueous suspension reveals a single, sharp peak corresponding to a well-defined average hydrodynamic radius, $R_0$.\n\nThe researcher then performs a titration experiment. A concentrated stock solution of a non-ionic detergent, D, is slowly added to the proteoliposome suspension. The experiment is monitored by DLS at three distinct stages:\n1.  **Stage 1**: The total concentration of detergent D in the suspension is well below its Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC).\n2.  **Stage 2**: The total concentration of detergent D is raised to a level near the effective CMC required for solubilization, a point where the liposomal structures are actively being disrupted.\n3.  **Stage 3**: The total concentration of detergent D is well above the CMC, and the system has reached equilibrium, ensuring the complete solubilization of the proteoliposomes.\n\nAssuming the protein P remains structurally intact throughout the process, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected evolution of the DLS particle size distribution (plotted as scattering intensity versus hydrodynamic radius) from Stage 1 to Stage 3?\n\nA. Stage 1: A single, unimodal peak at a large hydrodynamic radius. Stage 2: The distribution becomes very broad and potentially multimodal, indicating a highly heterogeneous population of particles.

Stage 1: A single, unimodal peak at a large hydrodynamic radius. Stage 2: The peak broadens, and its average hydrodynamic radius increases as detergent molecules adsorb onto the surface of the proteoliposomes. Stage 3: The broad peak sharpens into a single, unimodal peak at a hydrodynamic radius larger than the initial $R_0$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the changes in a Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) particle size distribution during the detergent-mediated solubilization of proteoliposomes. DLS measures the diffusion of particles in a solution, from which a hydrodynamic radius ($R_H$) is calculated. Larger particles diffuse more slowly and correspond to a larger $R_H$. The key is to understand how the population of particles in the suspension changes at each stage of the detergent titration.\n\n**Stage 1: Detergent concentration well below the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC)**\n\nAt concentrations far below the CMC, the detergent molecules (D) exist predominantly as monomers in the aqueous phase. While some monomers may partition into the lipid bilayer of the proteoliposomes, their concentration is too low to cause significant structural disruption. The particles detected by DLS are still the intact proteoliposomes. Since the initial suspension was described as monodisperse, DLS will show a single, relatively narrow (unimodal) peak at a large hydrodynamic radius, $R_0$, corresponding to these large vesicular structures. Therefore, the DLS profile remains essentially unchanged from the initial state without any detergent.\n\n**Stage 2: Detergent concentration near the CMC (active solubilization)**\n\nThis is the most complex stage. As the detergent concentration approaches and surpasses its CMC, the detergent's activity increases dramatically. The process of membrane solubilization is widely understood to occur via a multi-step mechanism. First, detergent monomers saturate the lipid bilayer. Once the membrane is saturated, it becomes unstable and begins to break down. This is not an instantaneous event where all liposomes convert to the final product simultaneously. Instead, it is a highly cooperative and heterogeneous process.\n\nDuring this transition, the solution contains a diverse mixture of species:\n*   Intact or partially saturated proteoliposomes (large particles, ~$R_0$).\n*   Liposome fragments of various sizes.\n*   Growing mixed micelles, which are small aggregates containing lipids, protein, and detergent.\n*   Newly formed protein-detergent complexes (PDCs), where a single protein molecule is encircled by a belt of detergent.\n*   Pure detergent micelles (if the bulk concentration exceeds the CMC).\n\nThis extreme heterogeneity in particle size means that DLS will detect a very wide range of diffusion coefficients. The resulting size distribution plot will no longer be a single sharp peak. Instead, it will appear as a very broad distribution, reflecting the continuum of differently sized particles. It could also appear as multimodal, with several overlapping and poorly resolved peaks.\n\n**Stage 3: Detergent concentration well above the CMC (solubilization complete)**\n\nAt a detergent concentration significantly above that required for solubilization, the system reaches equilibrium. All the original proteoliposome structures have been completely disassembled. The lipids and the membrane protein are now fully solubilized by the detergent. The major species present in the solution are:\n*   **Protein-Detergent Complexes (PDCs):** Each monomeric protein P is now individually encased in a micelle-like shell of detergent D. These complexes are particles of a well-defined size, which is much smaller than the original proteoliposomes.\n*   **Mixed Lipid-Detergent Micelles:** The phospholipids L from the original liposomes are now incorporated into micelles along with detergent molecules. These are also relatively small.\n*   **Pure Detergent Micelles:** The excess detergent in the solution forms its own micelles. These are typically the smallest particles in the system.\n\nThe original large proteoliposomes (size $R_0$) are no longer present. The DLS will now detect a population of much smaller particles. This will result in the appearance of one or more new peaks at significantly smaller hydrodynamic radii. For example, one peak might correspond to the PDCs, and another, smaller peak might correspond to the mixed/pure detergent micelles. Because these resulting particles (PDCs and micelles) are generally uniform in size, these new peaks will be relatively narrow, similar to the initial proteoliposome peak but located at much smaller $R_H$ values.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing this physical description to the given choices:\n*   **Choice A** perfectly matches our analysis: A single large peak in Stage 1; a broad, heterogeneous distribution in Stage 2; and the disappearance of the large peak in favor of new, smaller peaks in Stage 3.\n*   **Choice B** is incorrect because solubilization does not result in a solution of monomers; it results in micelles and PDCs, which are detectable by DLS.\n*   **Choice C** is incorrect because it describes a smooth, continuous shrinking process. This ignores the critical, heterogeneous transition phase where multiple species of different sizes coexist.\n*   **Choice D** is incorrect because it suggests that proteoliposomes remain intact while micelles form independently. In reality, the detergent actively destroys the liposomes to form mixed micelles and PDCs.\n*   **Choice E** is incorrect because solubilization leads to the formation of smaller particles (micelles and PDCs), not larger ones. Adsorption of detergent might cause a slight initial increase in size, but the dominant process at and above the CMC is disassembly and size reduction.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is provided by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2138787"}, {"introduction": "A common challenge in the lab is finding that your target membrane protein has failed to solubilize and remains in the pellet after centrifugation.

In that case, transmembrane proteins such as Integrolin remain embedded in unsolubilized membrane fragments that pellet upon ultracentrifugation, consistent with the observation that over 95% of the protein is in the pellet.\n\nWe now assess the alternatives:\n- Increasing detergent concentration to raise the detergent-to-lipid ratio directly addresses the requirement $R \\ge R_{sol}$, making solubilization likely. This aligns with the model above.\n- Decreasing detergent concentration to near $\\text{CMC}$ would further ensure $R < R_{sol}$ and prevent solubilization; non-ionic detergents like DDM are generally mild and do not typically denature at the concentrations used for solubilization.\n- Ultracentrifugation at $100{,}000 \\times g$ pellets large vesicles and membrane fragments; small detergent micelles and protein–detergent complexes remain in the supernatant.
