This catalysis is primarily mediated by ribosomal RNA (rRNA), making the ribosome a ribozyme. In a wild-type (WT) bacterial ribosome, a crucial universally conserved adenosine nucleotide, which we will label `A2451`, resides in the P-site of the PTC. The primary role of `A2451` is to use its N1 atom to form a critical hydrogen bond with the 2'-hydroxyl group of the peptidyl-tRNA's terminal adenosine, thereby precisely orienting the ester bond of the nascent polypeptide chain for nucleophilic attack by the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A-site.\n\nConsider a scenario where a mutant ribosome is constructed with a single point mutation, `A2451G`. This substitution of adenine with guanine completely ablates the specific hydrogen bond responsible for orienting the peptidyl-tRNA.
