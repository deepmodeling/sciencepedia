{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The activity of protein kinases is highly specific, but how does a kinase find its correct substrate among thousands of other proteins in the cell? The answer lies in sequence recognition, where kinases identify specific amino acid patterns, or consensus motifs, around the target residue. This practice will allow you to apply this principle by scanning a protein's primary sequence to predict the most likely site of phosphorylation, a fundamental skill in studying cell signaling [@problem_id:2133230].", "problem": "A research team is studying a newly identified peptide hormone, which they have named \"Signalin\". They hypothesize that its activity is regulated by phosphorylation. The primary amino acid sequence of Signalin, written from the N-terminus (position 1) to the C-terminus, is:\n\n`V-D-A-R-K-S-I-G-R-R-L-T-A-P-V-S-E-L`\n\nProtein Kinase A (PKA) is a common enzyme that catalyzes phosphorylation. Its consensus recognition motif is `R-R-X-S/T`, where R is Arginine, X can be any amino acid, and phosphorylation occurs on the Serine (S) or Threonine (T) residue within the motif.\n\nBased on the provided sequence and recognition motif, which of the following residues in Signalin is the most likely target for phosphorylation by PKA?\n\nA. S6\nB. R9\nC. T12\nD. S16", "solution": "We first index the amino acid sequence from the N-terminus:\n1: V, 2: D, 3: A, 4: R, 5: K, 6: S, 7: I, 8: G, 9: R, 10: R, 11: L, 12: T, 13: A, 14: P, 15: V, 16: S, 17: E, 18: L.\n\nProtein Kinase A recognizes the consensus motif `R-R-X-S/T`, meaning there must be two consecutive arginines at positions $j$ and $j+1$, any residue at $j+2$, and the phosphoacceptor residue $S$ or $T$ at $j+3$. Phosphorylation occurs on the serine or threonine at position $j+3$ of the motif.\n\nWe scan the sequence for `R-R-X-S/T`:\n- At positions $9$ to $12$, the sequence is `R9-R10-L11-T12`, which matches `R-R-X-T`. Therefore, residue $12$ (T12) is the phosphoacceptor site predicted for PKA.\n- No other consecutive `R-R` pairs appear elsewhere in the sequence, so there are no alternative matches to the consensus motif.\n- Residues S6 and S16 do not satisfy the required preceding `R-R-X` pattern, and R9 is not a phosphoacceptor residue.\n\nThus, the most likely PKA phosphorylation site in Signalin is T12, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2133230"}, {"introduction": "Once a potential phosphorylation site is identified, the next critical step is to determine its functional importance. Researchers use site-directed mutagenesis to create proteins that either cannot be phosphorylated (phospho-null) or that structurally imitate the phosphorylated state (phosphomimetic). This exercise explores the logic behind this powerful technique, challenging you to predict how these mutations will affect a protein's activity and thereby reveal the function of its regulation by phosphorylation [@problem_id:2133240].", "problem": "An enzyme, named \"Catalytic Regulator of Apoptosis\" (CRA), plays a crucial role in a cell signaling pathway. In its basal, non-phosphorylated state, CRA is inactive. The activity of CRA is switched on when a specific kinase phosphorylates a single regulatory serine residue at position 85 (Ser-85). This phosphorylation event induces a conformational change that activates the enzyme.\n\nTo investigate the function of CRA, a researcher genetically engineers two distinct populations of cells. Each population expresses a different mutant form of the CRA protein instead of the wild-type version.\n- **Mutant A**: The serine residue at position 85 has been replaced by an alanine residue.\n- **Mutant B**: The serine residue at position 85 has been replaced by a glutamate residue.\n\nAssuming the mutations do not affect protein folding stability or expression levels, and that the activating kinase is present and functional in both cell populations, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected catalytic activity of the CRA enzyme in these cells?\n\nA. The CRA from Mutant A will be constitutively active, while the CRA from Mutant B will be permanently inactive.\n\nB. The CRA from both Mutant A and Mutant B will be permanently inactive.\n\nC. The CRA from both Mutant A and Mutant B will be regulated by the kinase in the same manner as the wild-type protein.\n\nD. The CRA from Mutant A will be permanently inactive, while the CRA from Mutant B will be constitutively active.\n\nE. The CRA from Mutant A will have normal, regulated activity, while the CRA from Mutant B will be constitutively active.", "solution": "The stated regulatory mechanism is that CRA is inactive when unphosphorylated and becomes active upon phosphorylation of Ser-85 by a kinase. This implies that the hydroxyl group of serine at position 85 is required as the substrate for phosphorylation, and that the resulting phosphate introduces a negative charge that stabilizes an active conformation.\n\nFor Mutant A (S85A), serine is replaced by alanine. Alanine lacks the hydroxyl group required for phosphorylation by a serine/threonine kinase. Therefore, the kinase cannot phosphorylate position 85 in this mutant. Without the phosphate, the activating negative charge and the associated conformational switch cannot occur, so CRA remains in its basal inactive state irrespective of kinase presence. Hence, Mutant A is predicted to be permanently inactive.\n\nFor Mutant B (S85E), serine is replaced by glutamate. Glutamate carries a constitutive negative charge at physiological pH and is commonly used as a phosphomimetic substitution to mimic the effect of phosphorylation. This negative charge at position 85 can stabilize the active conformation even without actual phosphorylation by the kinase, leading to activity independent of kinase regulation. Therefore, Mutant B is predicted to be constitutively active.\n\nComparing these outcomes to the provided choices, the description that matches is that Mutant A is permanently inactive, while Mutant B is constitutively active.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2133240"}, {"introduction": "The principles of phosphorylation and kinase specificity are central to developing and testing new drugs, particularly kinase inhibitors. This practice places you in the role of a researcher tasked with interpreting a Western blot, a core technique in molecular biology used to visualize protein modifications. You will analyze experimental data to determine if a new inhibitor successfully blocks a signaling pathway, learning how to use controls and phospho-specific antibodies to draw clear conclusions [@problem_id:2133244].", "problem": "A research team is investigating a signaling pathway where a specific Growth Factor (GF) induces the activation of Kinase-A (KA), which in turn phosphorylates a target substrate, Protein-S (PS). To develop a new therapeutic, they have designed a small molecule inhibitor, Inh-1, intended to specifically block the catalytic activity of KA.\n\nTo test the efficacy of Inh-1, they perform a Western blot experiment. They culture four identical batches of cells. The cell lysates from each batch are separated by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a membrane, and analyzed. The four treatment conditions are as follows:\n- **Lane 1:** Cells treated with a vehicle solution (negative control).\n- **Lane 2:** Cells stimulated with the Growth Factor (GF).\n- **Lane 3:** Cells treated with the inhibitor Inh-1 alone.\n- **Lane 4:** Cells pre-treated with the inhibitor Inh-1, and then stimulated with the Growth Factor (GF).\n\nTo visualize the results, they use two different primary antibodies on two separate, identical blots prepared from the same four lysates:\n1.  **Blot 1:** Probed with an antibody that recognizes the total amount of Protein-S (anti-PS), regardless of its phosphorylation state.\n2.  **Blot 2:** Probed with a phospho-specific antibody that only binds to Protein-S when it is phosphorylated by Kinase-A (anti-pPS).\n\nAssuming that Inh-1 is a highly effective and specific inhibitor of Kinase-A, that KA is the primary kinase responsible for phosphorylating PS in response to GF, and that the total amount of PS does not change during the short duration of the experiment, which of the following options correctly describes the expected pattern of bands on the Western blots?\n\nA) **Blot 1 (anti-PS):** A band of equal intensity is present in all four lanes. **Blot 2 (anti-pPS):** A strong band is present in Lane 2 and Lane 4. No bands are present in Lane 1 and Lane 3.\n\nB) **Blot 1 (anti-PS):** A band is present only in Lane 2. **Blot 2 (anti-pPS):** A band is present only in Lane 2.\n\nC) **Blot 1 (anti-PS):** A band of equal intensity is present in all four lanes. **Blot 2 (anti-pPS):** A strong band is present only in Lane 2. No bands (or only a very faint basal band) are present in Lanes 1, 3, and 4.\n\nD) **Blot 1 (anti-PS):** A band of equal intensity is present in all four lanes. **Blot 2 (anti-pPS):** A strong band is present in all four lanes.\n\nE) **Blot 1 (anti-PS):** Bands of varying intensity are present across the four lanes. **Blot 2 (anti-pPS):** A strong band is present only in Lane 2.", "solution": "The goal of this experiment is to determine if the inhibitor, Inh-1, effectively blocks the phosphorylation of Protein-S (PS) by Kinase-A (KA). To do this, we must analyze the expected results for two separate Western blots: one for total protein (anti-PS) and one for the phosphorylated form (anti-pPS).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the expected outcome for Blot 1, which is probed with the anti-PS antibody. This antibody detects the total amount of Protein-S in the cell lysate loaded into each lane. The problem states that the total amount of PS is not expected to change during the experiment. Therefore, this blot serves as a loading control, ensuring that roughly equal amounts of total protein from the cell lysates were loaded into each of the four lanes. A successful loading control will show a band of approximately equal intensity in all four lanes. This immediately casts doubt on options B and E, which describe unequal or missing bands for the total protein blot.\n\nNext, let's analyze the expected outcome for Blot 2, which is probed with the phospho-specific anti-pPS antibody. This antibody only detects PS that has been phosphorylated by KA, so it is a direct measure of KA activity. We will analyze each lane:\n\n- **Lane 1 (Negative Control):** These cells were untreated. In the absence of the Growth Factor (GF) stimulus, Kinase-A (KA) should be largely inactive. Therefore, there should be little to no phosphorylation of Protein-S. We expect to see no band, or at most, a very faint band representing basal phosphorylation levels.\n\n- **Lane 2 (Positive Control):** These cells were treated with GF. GF activates KA, which then phosphorylates its substrate, PS. This is the condition where we expect maximum KA activity. Therefore, we should see a strong band in this lane, indicating the presence of phosphorylated PS (pPS).\n\n- **Lane 3 (Inhibitor Alone):** These cells were treated only with the inhibitor Inh-1. Similar to the negative control in Lane 1, there is no GF stimulus, so KA is inactive. The inhibitor's presence further ensures KA inactivity. We expect to see no band in this lane.\n\n- **Lane 4 (Inhibition Test):** These cells were pre-treated with the inhibitor Inh-1 and then stimulated with GF. Although GF is present and would normally activate KA, the problem states that Inh-1 is a highly effective inhibitor of KA's catalytic activity. Therefore, despite the activation signal, KA is blocked from phosphorylating PS. We expect to see no band (or a significantly reduced band compared to Lane 2), demonstrating the inhibitor's efficacy.\n\nCombining these observations:\n- **Blot 1 (anti-PS):** A band of equal intensity should be present in all four lanes (1, 2, 3, and 4).\n- **Blot 2 (anti-pPS):** A strong band should be present only in Lane 2. Lanes 1, 3, and 4 should be empty or show only a very faint band.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on this complete picture:\n- **A)** Incorrect. It suggests that the inhibitor is ineffective, as phosphorylation still occurs in its presence (band in Lane 4 is strong).\n- **B)** Incorrect. It suggests the total protein level changes and is only present upon stimulation, which contradicts the role of a loading control and the problem statement.\n- **C)** Correct. This option perfectly matches our derived expectations: the loading control (Blot 1) shows equal protein amounts in all lanes, and the experimental blot (Blot 2) shows phosphorylation only in the lane with the stimulus (GF) but without the inhibitor. The absence of a band in Lane 4 confirms the inhibitor is effective.\n- **D)** Incorrect. It suggests that Protein-S is constitutively phosphorylated under all conditions, which would mean the signaling pathway is not regulated by GF as described.\n- **E)** Incorrect. It suggests a failure in the experimental procedure, as the loading control shows unequal loading. While possible in a real experiment, this is not the *expected* outcome for a well-performed experiment designed to test inhibitor efficacy.\n\nTherefore, the option that correctly describes the expected results for a successful experiment confirming the inhibitor's efficacy is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2133244"}]}
