{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) acts as the cell's primary factory and quality control checkpoint for a vast number of proteins destined for secretion or insertion into membranes. A key player in this process is the chaperone protein BiP, which assists in proper folding and prevents aggregation. This first exercise invites you to consider a hypothetical but conceptually critical scenario: what happens to a newly made protein when this essential chaperone is removed? By predicting the fate of the protein, you will explore the fundamental principles of protein quality control and the critical role of chaperones in maintaining cellular homeostasis [@problem_id:2130116].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating a newly characterized secreted protein, which we will call Factor-S. The correct folding of Factor-S into its active conformation is critically dependent on the formation of multiple disulfide bonds. The gene for Factor-S is expressed in a genetically engineered mammalian cell line in which the gene for the essential Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) chaperone, BiP (Binding immunoglobulin Protein), has been conditionally knocked out. Assuming the protein is successfully translocated into the ER lumen, what is the most likely fate of the newly synthesized Factor-S molecules in these BiP-deficient cells?\n\nA. Factor-S will be correctly folded and efficiently secreted from the cell, as disulfide bond formation is the only critical step.\n\nB. Factor-S will accumulate in the cytosol, as it cannot be properly processed without BiP.\n\nC. Factor-S will fail to fold correctly, leading to its aggregation in the ER lumen and/or its targeting for degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway.\n\nD. Factor-S will fold correctly but will be retained in the Golgi apparatus, unable to be packaged into secretory vesicles.\n\nE. Factor-S will misfold and be directly transported from the ER to the lysosome for degradation.", "solution": "We are told that Factor-S is successfully translocated into the ER lumen and that its correct folding requires multiple disulfide bonds. In the ER, an oxidizing environment supports disulfide bond formation, which is catalyzed and isomerized by protein disulfide isomerases (PDI). However, proper folding of most secretory proteins requires ER chaperones, prominently BiP (GRP78), an Hsp70-family chaperone. BiP binds exposed hydrophobic segments of nascent and partially folded polypeptides, prevents aggregation, assists productive folding and assembly, and participates in ER quality control. It also helps provide time and context for PDI-mediated disulfide bond isomerization to reach the native pattern. \n\nIn BiP-deficient cells, although disulfide bonds can still form, the absence of BiP leads to several predictable outcomes: unshielded hydrophobic regions on nascent Factor-S will increase nonproductive intermolecular interactions, promoting misfolding and aggregation; non-native disulfide bonds may accumulate because chaperone-assisted cycles of folding and PDI-catalyzed isomerization are impaired; misfolded or aggregated proteins will be retained in the ER by quality control and targeted for ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which retrotranslocates them to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation. While ER-phagy/lysosomal routes can occur under stress, the canonical fate of misfolded ER proteins is ERAD, not direct transport to lysosomes.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because disulfide bond formation alone is not sufficient; chaperone assistance is critical to prevent aggregation and facilitate correct folding and disulfide isomerization.\n- B is inconsistent with the stated assumption that translocation into the ER lumen is successful; therefore, Factor-S will not accumulate in the cytosol for this reason.\n- C is correct: without BiP, Factor-S will fail to fold correctly, leading to aggregation in the ER and/or targeting to ERAD.\n- D is incorrect because BiP deficiency affects ER folding, not post-ER Golgi retention or vesicle packaging after correct folding.\n- E is incorrect because the primary quality control route for misfolded ER proteins is ERAD to the proteasome, not direct routing to lysosomes.\n\nTherefore, the most likely fate of Factor-S in BiP-deficient cells is misfolding with aggregation in the ER and/or ERAD.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2130116"}, {"introduction": "When a protein fails to fold correctly, the cell must dispose of it through a process called ER-Associated Degradation (ERAD). However, ERAD is not a one-size-fits-all system; it is a highly sophisticated pathway that must recognize and handle proteins with defects in different locationsâ€”the ER lumen, the membrane itself, or a cytosolic domain. This practice challenges you to think like a cell biologist by diagnosing the \"lesion\" on several misfolded proteins and assigning them to the correct degradation machinery, specifically the Hrd1 and Doa10 E3 ligase complexes. This task will deepen your understanding of the remarkable specificity and spatial organization of the cell's protein quality control network [@problem_id:2130125].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation (ERAD) pathway is a critical quality control mechanism that identifies and targets misfolded or unassembled proteins within the secretory pathway for proteasomal degradation. This process is topologically segregated into three main branches: ERAD-L for proteins with defects in the ER lumen, ERAD-M for proteins with defects in their transmembrane domains, and ERAD-C for proteins with lesions in their cytosolic domains. Two key multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, Hrd1 and Doa10, orchestrate these pathways. Their substrate recognition strategies are distinct: the Hrd1 complex primarily surveys the ER lumen and membrane for misfolded regions (ERAD-L/M), often by detecting exposed hydrophobic patches, while the Doa10 complex specifically recognizes defects in the cytosolic domains of ER-resident proteins (ERAD-C).\n\nConsider the following four hypothetical scenarios involving different misfolded proteins:\n\n1.  A soluble lysosomal hydrolase is synthesized and translocated into the ER. A mutation prevents the formation of a crucial disulfide bond, causing the protein to remain in a partially unfolded conformation entirely within the ER lumen, exposing its hydrophobic core.\n2.  A Type II single-pass transmembrane protein has its N-terminus in the cytosol and its C-terminus in the ER lumen. The luminal domain and transmembrane helix are correctly folded and stable. However, a mutation within its N-terminal cytosolic tail causes this entire domain to become unstructured and prone to aggregation.\n3.  A multi-pass G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) has several of its transmembrane helices mutated such that they are too short to span the membrane correctly. This results in instability and exposure of hydrophobic residues within the plane of the ER membrane, while its luminal and cytosolic loops remain relatively structured.\n4.  A glycolytic enzyme, which is synthesized on free ribosomes and functions exclusively in the cytosol, acquires a mutation that destabilizes its tertiary structure, leading to its misfolding and inactivation.\n\nBased on the distinct substrate recognition principles of the Hrd1 and Doa10 complexes, which of the following statements is the only correct conclusion?\n\nA. Protein 1 is targeted by Doa10, and Protein 2 is targeted by Hrd1.\n\nB. Protein 2 is targeted by Doa10, and Protein 4 is targeted by Hrd1.\n\nC. Protein 1 is targeted by Hrd1, and Protein 2 is targeted by Doa10.\n\nD. Protein 3 is targeted by Hrd1, and Protein 4 is targeted by Doa10.\n\nE. All four proteins are recognized and targeted for degradation by the Hrd1 complex.", "solution": "We apply the topology-based partitioning of ERAD and substrate recognition by its E3 ligases. The ERAD branches are defined by the location of the folding lesion: ERAD-L for lesions in the ER lumen, ERAD-M for lesions in the membrane domain, and ERAD-C for lesions in cytosolic domains of ER-resident proteins. The Hrd1 complex primarily executes ERAD-L and ERAD-M by recognizing exposed hydrophobic or otherwise misfolded features in the lumen or within transmembrane segments, often with help from luminal adaptors and chaperones. The Doa10 complex primarily executes ERAD-C, recognizing misfolded cytosolic domains of proteins that are ER-resident.\n\nEvaluate each scenario using these rules:\n1. The soluble lysosomal hydrolase is misfolded entirely within the ER lumen due to a disulfide-bond defect, exposing hydrophobic core. This is a classic ERAD-L substrate and is targeted by the Hrd1 complex, not Doa10.\n2. The Type II single-pass membrane protein has a misfolded N-terminal cytosolic tail, while its luminal domain and transmembrane segment are stable. The lesion is cytosolic on an ER-resident protein, defining an ERAD-C substrate recognized by Doa10.\n3. The GPCR has defective transmembrane helices that are too short, causing instability and exposure of hydrophobic residues within the membrane. This is an ERAD-M substrate targeted by Hrd1, not Doa10.\n4. The misfolded glycolytic enzyme is a cytosolic protein synthesized on free ribosomes and does not enter the ER. It is not an ERAD substrate and therefore is not targeted by Hrd1 or Doa10; it is handled by cytosolic protein quality control ubiquitin ligases.\n\nNow test each option:\nA. Protein 1 by Doa10 and Protein 2 by Hrd1 is incorrect; these are reversed relative to ERAD-L and ERAD-C assignments.\nB. Protein 2 by Doa10 is correct, but Protein 4 by Hrd1 is incorrect because Protein 4 is not an ERAD substrate.\nC. Protein 1 by Hrd1 and Protein 2 by Doa10 is correct: ERAD-L/M by Hrd1 for Protein 1 and ERAD-C by Doa10 for Protein 2.\nD. Protein 3 by Hrd1 is correct, but Protein 4 by Doa10 is incorrect for the same reason as in B.\nE. All four by Hrd1 is incorrect because Protein 2 belongs to ERAD-C (Doa10), and Protein 4 is not an ERAD substrate.\n\nThus, the only correct conclusion among the options is that Protein 1 is targeted by Hrd1 and Protein 2 is targeted by Doa10.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2130125"}, {"introduction": "When the accumulation of misfolded proteins overwhelms the ER's folding and degradation capacity, the cell activates a powerful emergency signaling network known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). But how can a researcher tell if this cellular alarm has been triggered? This question moves from theory to experimental design, asking you to devise a strategy to detect UPR activation in the lab. Focusing on the unique molecular signature of the IRE1Î±-XBP1 signaling branch, you will learn how a common biochemical technique, the Western blot, can provide definitive evidence of ER stress, linking a complex cellular pathway to a concrete experimental readout [@problem_id:2130099].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. They treat a culture of mammalian cells with dithiothreitol (DTT), a reducing agent known to disrupt disulfide bond formation and cause the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. This accumulation is expected to trigger the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a complex signaling network designed to restore homeostasis. To confirm the activation of the UPR, the biologist plans to perform a Western blot analysis on lysates from both untreated (control) and DTT-treated cells.\n\nWhich of the following experimental strategies represents the most specific and direct method to confirm the activation of a key UPR signaling branch using a Western blot?\n\nA. Probing for the transcription factor XBP1, expecting to see the appearance of a distinct, higher molecular weight isoform (spliced XBP1) in DTT-treated cells.\n\nB. Probing for the ER chaperone BiP (also known as GRP78), expecting to see a significant overall increase in its protein levels in DTT-treated cells.\n\nC. Probing for the housekeeping protein Î²-actin, expecting to see its levels remain constant between control and DTT-treated samples.\n\nD. Probing for the kinase IRE1Î±, expecting to see a significant decrease in its total protein levels due to activation-induced degradation in DTT-treated cells.\n\nE. Probing for the pro-apoptotic protein Caspase-3, expecting to see the appearance of its cleaved, active fragments in DTT-treated cells.", "solution": "The treatment with dithiothreitol disrupts disulfide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to accumulation of unfolded proteins and activation of the Unfolded Protein Response. The UPR consists of three principal signaling branches initiated by IRE1Î±, PERK, and ATF6. To confirm activation of a specific branch by Western blot, the readout should be both mechanistically proximal to the branchâ€™s activation event and as branch-specific as possible.\n\nFor the IRE1Î± branch, activation triggers its endoribonuclease activity, which performs an unconventional cytosolic splicing of XBP1 mRNA by removing a small intron. This splicing causes a translational frameshift, producing the spliced transcription factor XBP1s, which has a higher molecular weight than the unspliced XBP1u. Therefore, probing for XBP1 and detecting the appearance or increase of the higher molecular weight XBP1s protein in DTT-treated cells is a direct and specific Western blot readout of IRE1Î± RNase activation.\n\nAssessment of the alternatives:\n- Option A directly targets the IRE1Î±-XBP1 branch via the expected appearance of the higher molecular weight XBP1s protein. This is both specific and mechanistically direct for this UPR branch.\n- Option B measures BiP/GRP78 upregulation, which is a general chaperone induction downstream of UPR and can be influenced by multiple branches and stress contexts; it is not branch-specific and is less direct.\n- Option C concerns a loading control (Î²-actin) and does not report on UPR activation.\n- Option D posits a decrease in total IRE1Î± upon activation; this is not a canonical or reliable activation marker. IRE1Î± activation is commonly assessed by its phosphorylation or by XBP1 mRNA splicing, not by reduction of total protein.\n- Option E detects caspase-3 cleavage, which indicates apoptosis rather than specifically confirming UPR activation; apoptosis can occur downstream of unresolved ER stress but is not a specific or direct readout of a UPR signaling branch.\n\nTherefore, the most specific and direct Western blot strategy among the options to confirm activation of a key UPR signaling branch is detecting the spliced XBP1 protein associated with IRE1Î± activation.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2130099"}]}
