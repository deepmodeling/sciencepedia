To determine the protein's turnover rate, a pulse-chase experiment is conducted.\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows:\n1.  **Pulse Phase:** The cell culture is incubated for a brief period in a medium containing the radioactive amino acid $^{35}$S-methionine. During this time, newly synthesized proteins, including Stabilin-Q, incorporate the radioactive label.\n2.  **Chase Phase:** The radioactive medium is removed and replaced with a medium containing a large excess of non-radioactive methionine. This effectively stops the incorporation of $^{35}$S-methionine into new proteins. From this point forward ($t=0$), the amount of radioactivity in the existing pool of Stabilin-Q will decrease only as the protein is degraded.\n\nThe amount of radioactivity associated with isolated Stabilin-Q is then measured at various time points. At the beginning of the chase phase ($t = 0$ hours), the radioactivity measured from the Stabilin-Q sample is 25,600 counts per minute (CPM). After continuing the chase for 18.0 hours, the radioactivity from a newly isolated sample of Stabilin-Q is found to be 7,150 CPM.\n\nAssuming the degradation of Stabilin-Q follows first-order kinetics, calculate the first-order degradation rate constant ($k$) and the half-life ($t_{1/2}$) of the protein.\n\nExpress the degradation rate constant in units of hr$^{-1}$ and the half-life in units of hours.

A protein's amino acid sequence can contain specific signals, or \"degrons,\" that mark it for degradation. This practice problem [@problem_id:2131334] focuses on one of the most well-studied degrons: the identity of the N-terminal amino acid. By exploring the consequences of a single amino acid change at this critical position, you will apply the \"N-end rule\" to predict how cellular machinery decides whether a protein should have a long or short lifespan, a principle with powerful applications in synthetic biology.", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is studying a fast-acting signaling pathway in a mammalian cell line. To monitor the activity of a specific promoter within this pathway, they use a reporter gene encoding a highly stable protein with a half-life greater than 20 hours. The N-terminus of this reporter protein, after the removal of the initial methionine, begins with a valine residue. This long half-life is problematic because the fluorescence signal persists long after the signaling event has concluded, obscuring the dynamics of the pathway.\n\nTo create a reporter protein with a much shorter half-life, a researcher uses site-directed mutagenesis to alter the codon for the second amino acid. The new codon specifies arginine. The modified protein is confirmed to fold correctly and is functional as a reporter.\n\nBased on the established principles governing intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotes, what is the most likely consequence of changing the N-terminal residue from valine to arginine?\n\nA.

Specific N-terminal residues are classified as stabilizing or destabilizing.\n\n- Valine is a stabilizing N-terminal residue in the N-end rule, corresponding to a long half-life. This is consistent with the observed half-life greater than 20 hours for the original reporter that begins (after initiator methionine removal) with valine.\n\n- Arginine is a primary destabilizing N-terminal residue in the N-end rule. Proteins with an N-terminal arginine are recognized by N-recognin E3 ubiquitin ligases, which catalyze polyubiquitination, targeting the protein for rapid degradation by the 26S proteasome.\n\n- Therefore, changing the N-terminal residue from valine (stabilizing) to arginine (primary destabilizing) will markedly increase ubiquitin-proteasome–mediated turnover, leading to a much shorter intracellular half-life.\n\n- This effect is specific to degradation signaling and does not imply misfolding or aggregation (option C) or secretion (option E). The problem states the protein folds correctly and functions as a reporter, ruling out C. N-terminal residue identity does not redirect proteins to the secretory pathway, ruling out E. It also contradicts A and B because arginine is well established as destabilizing.\n\n- Consequently, the most likely outcome is a significant decrease in the protein’s half-life.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2131334"}, {"introduction": "Protein degradation is not a static process but a dynamically regulated one, often involving intricate cellular circuits. This final exercise challenges you to move beyond simple rules and analyze a multi-component regulatory network involving the famous tumor suppressor p53. You will trace the downstream effects of inhibiting a key enzyme, a deubiquitinase, which acts as a crucial \"off-switch\" in the degradation pathway [@problem_id:2131326]. Solving this problem requires systems-level thinking and illustrates how a deep understanding of protein turnover pathways is essential for designing modern therapeutic strategies against diseases like cancer.", "problem": "In cellular biology, the regulation of protein levels is critical for normal function and is often dysregulated in diseases like cancer. A primary mechanism for protein degradation is the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In this pathway, an E3 ubiquitin ligase attaches ubiquitin chains to a target protein, marking it for destruction by the proteasome. Conversely, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) can remove these ubiquitin tags, rescuing the protein from degradation.\n\nConsider the following well-established regulatory network involving the tumor suppressor protein p53:\n1.  The p53 protein's stability is primarily controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, which targets p53 for degradation.\n2.  The MDM2 protein itself is unstable because it can catalyze its own ubiquitination (auto-ubiquitination), leading to its own degradation.\n3.  A specific deubiquitinating enzyme, USP7, counteracts this auto-degradation by removing ubiquitin tags from MDM2, thereby stabilizing the MDM2 protein.\n\nA new cancer therapy involves the administration of a small molecule that is a potent and highly specific inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of USP7. Assuming the therapy is effective and the inhibitor reaches its target in cancer cells, what is the most likely direct consequence on the steady-state cellular concentration of the p53 protein?\n\nA. The cellular levels of p53 will increase.\n\nB. The cellular levels of p53 will decrease.\n\nC. The cellular levels of p53 will remain unchanged.\n\nD. The rate of p53 phosphorylation will increase, but its total level will be unaffected.\n\nE. The cellular levels of MDM2 will accumulate, leading to hyper-ubiquitination of p53.", "solution": "We model the stated regulatory network using standard protein synthesis-degradation balance at steady state and the principles that (i) polyubiquitination by an E3 ligase targets a protein for proteasomal degradation, and (ii) a deubiquitinating enzyme reduces ubiquitin on its substrate, thereby reducing its degradation rate.\n\nLet $P$ denote the cellular concentration of p53, $M$ the concentration of MDM2, and let $U$ denote the effective catalytic activity of USP7. Let $s_{P}$ and $s_{M}$ be the respective synthesis rates of p53 and MDM2. For degradation, we use first-order effective rates that reflect the biology described:\n- p53 degradation is promoted by MDM2. A minimal representation is $k_{P}(M) = k_{P,0} + k_{P,M} M$, with $k_{P,0} \\ge 0$ representing any MDM2-independent turnover and $k_{P,M} > 0$ the contribution from MDM2-dependent ubiquitination.\n- MDM2 degrades via auto-ubiquitination, which is opposed by USP7 deubiquitination. We represent the MDM2 effective degradation rate as $k_{M}(U) = k_{M,\\text{auto}} - k_{M,\\text{USP7}}(U)$, where $k_{M,\\text{auto}} > 0$ is the intrinsic auto-ubiquitination-driven component and $k_{M,\\text{USP7}}(U) \\ge 0$ is the USP7-dependent protective term that increases with $U$. Thus, inhibiting USP7 decreases $U$ and therefore decreases $k_{M,\\text{USP7}}(U)$, which increases $k_{M}(U)$.\n\nSteady states satisfy production equals loss:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{dP}{dt} = s_{P} - k_{P}(M) P \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad P_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{s_{P}}{k_{P}(M)} = \\frac{s_{P}}{k_{P,0} + k_{P,M} M},\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\frac{dM}{dt} = s_{M} - k_{M}(U) M \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad M_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{s_{M}}{k_{M}(U)}.\n$$\n\nIntroduce a potent, specific inhibitor of USP7, which lowers the effective USP7 activity from $U$ to a smaller value $U'$. Because $k_{M,\\text{USP7}}(U)$ is increasing in $U$, we have $k_{M,\\text{USP7}}(U') < k_{M,\\text{USP7}}(U)$, hence\n$$\nk_{M}(U') = k_{M,\\text{auto}} - k_{M,\\text{USP7}}(U') > k_{M,\\text{auto}} - k_{M,\\text{USP7}}(U) = k_{M}(U).\n$$\nTherefore, the MDM2 steady state decreases:\n$$\nM_{\\text{ss}}' = \\frac{s_{M}}{k_{M}(U')} < \\frac{s_{M}}{k_{M}(U)} = M_{\\text{ss}}.\n$$\n\nSince p53 steady state is $P_{\\text{ss}} = s_{P} / (k_{P,0} + k_{P,M} M)$ with $k_{P,M} > 0$, a decrease in $M$ reduces the denominator and increases $P_{\\text{ss}}$. Formally, $\\partial P_{\\text{ss}} / \\partial M = - s_{P} k_{P,M} / (k_{P,0} + k_{P,M} M)^{2} < 0$, so $M_{\\text{ss}}' < M_{\\text{ss}}$ implies $P_{\\text{ss}}' > P_{\\text{ss}}$.\n\nThus, inhibiting USP7 destabilizes MDM2 by allowing its auto-ubiquitination-driven degradation to proceed unopposed, leading to reduced MDM2 levels and, consequently, reduced ubiquitination and degradation of p53. The most likely direct consequence is an increase in the steady-state level of p53.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2131326"}]}
