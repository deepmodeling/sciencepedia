Based on its gene sequence, the predicted molecular weight of the polypeptide chain is 45 kDa. The biochemist purifies Enzyme Z from a culture of human cells and analyzes it using Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a technique that separates proteins based on their molecular weight. Instead of observing a sharp, distinct band at 45 kDa, the gel reveals a broad, diffuse smear spanning a range from approximately 60 kDa to 75 kDa.\n\nWhich of the following post-translational modifications provides the most plausible explanation for this experimental observation?\n\nA. Polyubiquitination\n\nB. Formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds\n\nC. Proteolytic cleavage\n\nD. Phosphorylation\n\nE. N-linked glycosylation", "solution": "SDS-PAGE separates denatured proteins primarily by apparent molecular weight because SDS binds along the polypeptide chain in approximate proportion to length and imparts a nearly uniform charge-to-mass ratio. Therefore, in the absence of unusual factors, a single polypeptide species yields a sharp band at its molecular weight. Post-translational modifications that add mass shift the apparent size upward; if the modification is heterogeneous in extent or composition, the protein population will distribute across a range of apparent sizes, producing a broad, diffuse smear rather than a single band.\n\nEvaluate each option against these principles:\n- Polyubiquitination adds multiples of ubiquitin (approximately 8.5 kDa each). While this can produce higher molecular weight species and smearing in whole-cell lysates, it typically yields ladders or extensive high-molecular-weight smears, often far above the unmodified size. Moreover, polyubiquitination is commonly a transient degradation signal and is less likely to be the dominant feature of a purified enzyme preparation. The observed 60–75 kDa range is consistent with an approximately 15–30 kDa addition but polyubiquitination would more typically generate a ladder with increments, and is less characteristic for a purified enzyme’s principal species.\n- Formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds does not change molecular weight. Under reducing SDS-PAGE, disulfides are cleaved; even under non-reducing conditions, mobility shifts from compaction are minor and do not produce a broad smear spanning 60–75 kDa from a 45 kDa polypeptide.\n- Proteolytic cleavage reduces size, producing bands below 45 kDa rather than larger apparent masses; it does not explain a smear shifted upward.\n- Phosphorylation adds approximately 80 Da per phosphate, which is negligible relative to kilodalton-scale resolution and cannot account for a 15–30 kDa upward shift or a broad smear.\n- N-linked glycosylation adds carbohydrate chains of variable composition and length at consensus sequons. Glycosylation increases the apparent molecular weight, and heterogeneity in glycan processing produces a diffuse band or smear across a range of sizes. A 45 kDa polypeptide appearing as a broad band between approximately 60 kDa and 75 kDa is a classic presentation of heterogeneous N-linked glycosylation; deglycosylation (for example, with PNGase F) typically collapses such smears to a sharp band at the predicted size.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation for the observed diffuse smear shifted upward from the predicted molecular weight is heterogeneous N-linked glycosylation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2124921"}, {"introduction": "Identifying a PTM is only the first step; the next crucial question is understanding its function. Because PTMs like phosphorylation are often transient, studying their effects can be difficult. This practice [@problem_id:2124910] introduces the elegant experimental strategy of site-directed mutagenesis, where specific amino acid substitutions are made to either prevent modification or permanently mimic its effects, allowing scientists to uncover the specific role of a PTM in a protein's function.", "problem": "In cellular signaling pathways, the activity of many proteins is regulated by phosphorylation, a common Post-Translational Modification (PTM). A scientist is studying a key regulatory protein whose function is switched 'on' or 'off' by the phosphorylation of a single, critical tyrosine (Y) residue. To dissect the specific roles of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the protein, the scientist plans to use site-directed mutagenesis to create two distinct mutants.\n\nThe first mutant, termed the \"non-phosphorylatable\" mutant, should structurally resemble the native, unphosphorylated state as closely as possible but be incapable of being phosphorylated. The second mutant, termed the \"phosphomimetic\" mutant, should permanently mimic the structural and electrostatic properties of the phosphorylated state.\n\nWhich of the following pairs of amino acid substitutions for the original tyrosine residue would be the most effective strategy for creating the (non-phosphorylatable, phosphomimetic) mutants, respectively?\n\nA. (Phenylalanine, Glutamate)\n\nB. (Tryptophan, Aspartate)\n\nC. (Alanine, Serine)\n\nD. (Leucine, Arginine)\n\nE. (Phenylalanine, Aspartate)", "solution": "We need two mutations at the key tyrosine site: one that cannot be phosphorylated but preserves the native unphosphorylated structure, and one that mimics the phosphorylated state’s electrostatics and sterics.\n\nFor the non-phosphorylatable mutant, the optimal substitution removes the hydroxyl group required for phosphorylation while preserving the aromatic ring and overall side-chain size to maintain structural similarity. Tyrosine differs from phenylalanine only by the hydroxyl group; replacing tyrosine with phenylalanine preserves the aromatic ring and steric profile but eliminates the phosphorylation site. Alternatives are inferior: tryptophan is bulkier and may disrupt packing; alanine is much smaller and non-aromatic; leucine is aliphatic and lacks the aromatic ring.\n\nFor the phosphomimetic mutant, the goal is to mimic the negative charge and some steric features of the phosphorylated tyrosine. While no amino acid perfectly mimics a phosphate group, glutamate or aspartate are commonly used. Between the two, glutamate generally provides a better mimic of the size and electrostatic distribution relative to a phosphoryl group on tyrosine due to its longer side chain, making it a more effective phosphomimetic than aspartate in many contexts.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A: (Phenylalanine, Glutamate) matches the standard strategy: phenylalanine for non-phosphorylatable and glutamate as the phosphomimetic.\n- B: Tryptophan is too bulky; aspartate is a possible but less optimal phosphomimetic.\n- C: Alanine removes the aromatic character; serine can still be phosphorylated.\n- D: Leucine is non-aromatic; arginine is positively charged, opposite of phosphate’s negative charge.\n- E: (Phenylalanine, Aspartate) is close but glutamate is generally preferred over aspartate for tyrosine phosphomimetics due to better steric mimicry.\n\nThus, the most effective pair is phenylalanine for non-phosphorylatable and glutamate for phosphomimetic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2124910"}, {"introduction": "Modern proteomic techniques can identify thousands of PTMs in a single experiment, but not all of them are functionally significant.
