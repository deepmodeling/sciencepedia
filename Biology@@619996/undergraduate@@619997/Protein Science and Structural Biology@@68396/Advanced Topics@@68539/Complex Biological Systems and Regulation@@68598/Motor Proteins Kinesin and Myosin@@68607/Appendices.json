They are typically built from distinct functional units, or domains: a motor 'head' that determines which cytoskeletal track it binds and a 'tail' domain that attaches to cargo. This thought experiment challenges you to apply this fundamental principle of domain modularity to predict the behavior of a novel, engineered protein, reinforcing your understanding of how structure dictates function at the molecular level. [@problem_id:2121246]", "problem": "In a cell biology research project, a team of scientists aims to study the principles of motor protein function by creating a novel chimeric protein. Motor proteins like kinesin and myosin are composed of distinct functional regions, or domains. Generally, they possess a \"motor domain\" (often called the head) which binds to a specific cytoskeletal filament and hydrolyzes Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to generate force, and a \"stalk/tail domain\" which is typically involved in dimerization and attaching to cellular cargo.\n\nThe natural function of kinesin is to move along microtubules, while the natural function of myosin is to move along actin filaments.\n\nThe scientists construct a chimeric protein by genetically fusing the motor domain from a muscle myosin II protein with the stalk domain from a conventional kinesin-1 protein. Assuming the resulting chimeric protein folds correctly and its domains retain their individual functions, which of the following cytoskeletal structures will it most likely bind to in an ATP-dependent manner?\n\nA. Actin filaments\n\nB. Microtubules\n\nC. Both actin filaments and microtubules\n\nD. Intermediate filaments\n\nE. The plasma membrane", "solution": "Motor proteins are modular: the motor (head) domain both binds the cytoskeletal track and hydrolyzes ATP to generate force, whereas the stalk/tail domain mediates dimerization and cargo attachment and does not determine filament specificity. Myosin motor domains bind actin filaments and undergo ATP-dependent binding and stepping on actin; kinesin motor domains bind microtubules. In the chimera described, the motor domain is from muscle myosin II, so the ATP-dependent binding specificity is dictated by myosin and therefore targets actin filaments. Substituting the kinesin-1 stalk/tail affects dimerization and cargo interactions but does not switch the track preference to microtubules. Intermediate filaments lack motors, and the plasma membrane is not a cytoskeletal track. Hence the chimeric protein will bind actin filaments in an ATP-dependent manner.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2121246"}, {"introduction": "Having established that the motor domain dictates track specificity, we now explore the engine that drives movement: the mechanochemical cycle fueled by ATP. The interaction between a motor protein and its track is not static; it changes dramatically depending on the nucleotide (ATP, ADP, or none) bound to the motor head. This practice problem uses a classic *in vitro* motility assay to investigate what happens when the fuel runs out, revealing the crucial 'rigor-like' state where kinesin binds tightly to microtubules in the absence of ATP. [@problem_id:2121276]", "problem": "An *in vitro* motility assay is prepared to study the action of the motor protein kinesin-1. In this experiment, a glass coverslip is coated with kinesin-1 motor proteins, which are immobilized by their tail domains, leaving their motor \"head\" domains free to interact. Subsequently, a solution containing fluorescently labeled microtubules and a high concentration of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) is added. Under a fluorescence microscope, the microtubules are observed to glide smoothly and continuously across the kinesin-coated surface.\n\nAfter a period of sustained movement, all the ATP in the solution is completely depleted. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the resulting state of the microtubules on the coverslip?\n\nA. The microtubules will detach from the kinesin-coated surface and diffuse freely in the solution.\n\nB. The microtubules will come to a halt, with the various kinesin motors bound to them arrested in random, different conformational states of their mechanochemical cycle.\n\nC. The microtubules will come to a halt and become tightly bound to the kinesin-coated surface.\n\nD. The microtubules will reverse their direction of gliding as the kinesin motors enter a futile, low-energy cycle.\n\nE. The microtubules will continue to glide for a short distance, powered by elastic energy stored in the kinesin proteins from the last ATP hydrolysis event, before stopping.", "solution": "Kinesin-1 driven gliding requires progression through its ATP-driven mechanochemical cycle. The key nucleotide states of a kinesin head and their microtubule (MT) affinities are:\n\n- ADP-bound ($\\text{K}\\cdot \\text{ADP}$): weak MT affinity in solution; microtubule binding catalyzes ADP release.\n- Nucleotide-free (apo, $\\text{K}$): strong MT affinity (rigor-like).\n- ATP-bound ($\\text{K}\\cdot \\text{ATP}$) and, in much of the cycle, $\\text{K}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot \\text{P}_{i}$: generally strong MT affinity during the force-generating and stepping transitions.\n\nThe critical transitions can be summarized schematically as:\n$$\n\\text{K}\\cdot \\text{ADP} + \\text{MT} \\xrightleftharpoons[\\text{weak}]{\\text{bind}} \\text{K}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot \\text{MT} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{ADP off}}} \\text{K}\\cdot \\text{MT} \\,,\n$$\nfollowed (when ATP is present) by\n$$\n\\text{K}\\cdot \\text{MT} + \\text{ATP} \\xrightarrow{} \\text{K}\\cdot \\text{ATP}\\cdot \\text{MT} \\xrightarrow{\\text{hydrolysis and product release}} \\text{stepping}.\n$$\n\nWhen $[\\text{ATP}]=0$ after depletion, the transition $\\text{K}\\cdot \\text{MT} \\to \\text{K}\\cdot \\text{ATP}\\cdot \\text{MT}$ is blocked. However, microtubule binding still promotes ADP release:\n$$\n\\text{K}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot \\text{MT} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{ADP off}}} \\text{K}\\cdot \\text{MT},\n$$\nand with no ATP available, the motor accumulates in the nucleotide-free apo state on the microtubule, which is a strong-binding state. The off-rate from this apo strong-binding state,\n$$\n\\text{K}\\cdot \\text{MT} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{off,apo}}} \\text{K} + \\text{MT},\n$$\nis very small. In a gliding assay with many surface-anchored motors engaging a single microtubule, multivalent strong binding makes the probability that all motors simultaneously detach negligibly small. Therefore, the microtubule motion ceases and the filament remains tightly bound to the kinesin-coated surface.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n\n- A is incorrect because in the absence of ATP, the dominant state is apo strong-binding; the microtubules do not detach and diffuse.\n- B is incorrect because the cycle does not arrest in random states; it accumulates specifically in the strong-binding apo state due to ADP release and the blockade of ATP binding.\n- C is correct: motion stops and the microtubules become tightly bound (rigor-like).\n- D is incorrect: kinesin does not reverse direction and no futile low-energy cycle proceeds without ATP.\n- E is incorrect: any elastic energy stored is insufficient to drive appreciable displacement without ATP, and collective strong binding halts motion essentially immediately.\n\nThus, the most accurate description is that the microtubules halt and become tightly bound to the surface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2121276"}, {"introduction": "We can move beyond qualitative descriptions of motor function to a quantitative analysis of their performance as molecular machines.
