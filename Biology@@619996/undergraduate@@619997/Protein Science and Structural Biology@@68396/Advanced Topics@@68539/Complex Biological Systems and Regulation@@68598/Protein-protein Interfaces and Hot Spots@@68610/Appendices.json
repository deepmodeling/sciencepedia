[@problem_id:2131824]", "problem": "In the field of drug discovery, understanding the principles of protein-protein interactions is crucial for designing effective therapeutic agents. Consider a hypothetical protein complex formed between an enzyme, \"Kinase A,\" and its specific regulatory protein, \"Regulin.\" The interaction interface between these two proteins is characterized by high shape complementarity and is known to be very tightly packed, leaving almost no empty space or cavities. Structural analysis reveals a \"hot spot\" residue, Glycine-72 (Gly72), on the surface of Regulin that fits perfectly into a small, deep pocket on the surface of Kinase A.\n\nA team of researchers decides to probe the importance of this interaction by using site-directed mutagenesis to replace Glycine-72 on Regulin with a Phenylalanine residue, creating the G72F mutant. Glycine is the smallest amino acid, with a single hydrogen atom as its side chain. Phenylalanine is a large, bulky amino acid with an aromatic ring as its side chain. Assume the single point mutation does not cause the overall fold of the Regulin protein to change.\n\nWhat is the most likely outcome of the G72F mutation on the binding interaction between Regulin and Kinase A?\n\nA. A significant increase in binding affinity (lower dissociation constant, $K_d$) because the hydrophobic phenylalanine side chain will be favorably buried in the pocket.\n\nB. No significant change in binding affinity, as Gly72 is a very small residue and likely contributes little to the overall binding energy.\n\nC. A significant decrease in binding affinity (higher dissociation constant, $K_d$) due to unfavorable steric clashes at the interface.\n\nD. The mutation causes both proteins to become covalently linked, resulting in an irreversible complex.\n\nE. The binding affinity will remain the same, but the binding kinetics (association and dissociation rates) will become much faster.", "solution": "We model the binding thermodynamics of Regulin to Kinase A using the standard relation between standard binding free energy and dissociation constant:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ} = RT \\ln K_{d}.\n$$\nDefine the change in binding free energy upon mutation as\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{mut}} - \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{wt}}.\n$$\nA positive $\\Delta\\Delta G$ implies weaker binding for the mutant, and via the exponential relation,\n$$\nK_{d,\\text{mut}} = \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{mut}}}{RT}\\right) > \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{wt}}}{RT}\\right) = K_{d,\\text{wt}}.\n$$\n\nGiven the structural description:\n- The interface is highly shape-complementary and tightly packed with minimal cavities, which indicates that residues at the interface are optimized for steric complementarity and van der Waals packing.\n- Gly72 is identified as a hot spot residue that fits perfectly into a small, deep pocket on Kinase A. A hot spot, by definition, contributes disproportionately to binding free energy; thus, perturbations at this site commonly yield large changes in $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$.\n\nAnalyze the G72F mutation:\n- Glycine has a minimal side chain (hydrogen), which allows close approach of backbone and neighboring side chains to optimize packing and avoid steric clashes in a tight pocket.\n- Phenylalanine has a bulky aromatic side chain. In a pre-optimized, tightly packed pocket with almost no empty space, replacing a minimal side chain with a large aromatic ring will introduce steric clashes unless significant conformational rearrangements occur.\n- Because the problem stipulates no change in the overall fold of Regulin, and the pocket on Kinase A is already small and deep, accommodating the phenylalanine ring would require unfavorable distortions at the interface or partial exclusion of the side chain from the pocket, both of which reduce favorable enthalpic contacts and may add strain.\n- The potential hydrophobic burial of phenylalanine cannot be realized without space; in the absence of a pre-formed cavity, the hydrophobic effect does not compensate for steric penalties. Thus, the net effect is an increase in $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ for binding.\n\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G > 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad K_{d,\\text{mut}} > K_{d,\\text{wt}},\n$$\nwhich corresponds to a significant decrease in binding affinity. This directly supports option C.\n\nThe other options are inconsistent with the given constraints:\n- A is unlikely because there is no available cavity to favorably bury phenylalanine without steric cost.\n- B contradicts the designation of Gly72 as a hot spot.\n- D is incorrect because a Gly-to-Phe substitution does not create covalent bonds between proteins.\n- E is unlikely; steric clashes typically reduce affinity and often slow productive association; maintaining identical affinity with faster kinetics lacks mechanistic support here.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2131824"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple shape, binding is a thermodynamic balancing act. This problem moves from qualitative concepts to quantitative calculation, focusing on the powerful role of entropy.

The binding interface between these two proteins is largely hydrophobic. A key aspect of the binding process involves changes in both solvent organization and protein conformation.\n\nTwo specific, quantifiable contributions to the overall binding free energy have been identified:\n1.  **Solvent Reorganization**: Upon complex formation, a total of 7 structurally ordered water molecules are displaced from the nonpolar surfaces of the two proteins into the bulk solvent. The entropic penalty for ordering a single water molecule at such an interface, relative to its state in bulk water, has been estimated to correspond to a free energy cost of $\\Delta G_{w,penalty} = 0.78$ kcal/mol.\n2.  **Conformational Restriction**: A critical \"hot spot\" interaction involves a methionine residue on Regulon-A fitting snugly into a hydrophobic pocket on Kinase-B. In the unbound state, this methionine side chain can freely adopt any of its 4 common rotameric conformations, which are assumed to be isoenergetic. Upon binding, it becomes locked into a single, specific conformation required for the interaction.\n\nAssuming the binding process occurs at a physiological temperature of $T = 310$ K, calculate the net contribution to the binding free energy ($\\Delta G_{net}$) resulting from only these two effects: the displacement of ordered water and the loss of the methionine side-chain's conformational entropy.\n\nFor your calculations, use the molar gas constant, $R = 1.987 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$.\n\nExpress your answer in kcal/mol, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We consider the net binding free energy as the sum of two contributions: release of ordered water molecules and loss of conformational entropy of the methionine side chain.
