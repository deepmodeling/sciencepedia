To solve this, we must first understand how the ribosome translates the original sequence and then analyze how the specified insertion mutation alters the outcome.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the original, unmutated mRNA translation.**\n\nThe ribosome reads the mRNA sequence in non-overlapping groups of three nucleotides, called codons. This sequence of codons is known as the reading frame. Translation begins at a specific start codon and continues until a stop codon is reached.\n\nThe original mRNA sequence is `5'-GCAUGAACCCGUUAUAGGCUAG-3'`.\nAccording to the problem, translation starts at the first `AUG` codon. We can identify the reading frame by grouping the sequence into codons from this starting point.\n\nStart Codon: `AUG`\nThe codons are:\n- `AUG`\n- `AAC`\n- `CCG`\n- `UUA`\n- `UAG`\n- `GGC`\n- `UAG`\n\nNow, we translate this sequence using the provided genetic code table:\n- `AUG` -> Methionine (Met)\n- `AAC` -> Asparagine (Asn)\n- `CCG` -> Proline (Pro)\n- `UUA` -> Leucine (Leu)\n- `UAG` -> STOP\n\nTranslation terminates at the `UAG` stop codon. Therefore, the polypeptide produced from the original, unmutated mRNA would be Met-Asn-Pro-Leu. This corresponds to option A, which is a common distractor representing the pre-mutation product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the mutated mRNA sequence.**\n\nThe problem states that a single Guanine (G) nucleotide is inserted immediately after the `AUG` start codon. Let's construct the new mRNA sequence.\n\nOriginal sequence: `5'-...AUG AAC CCG UUA UAG...-3'`\nInsertion of 'G' after `AUG`: `5'-...AUG G AAC CCG UUA UAG...-3'`\n\nNow, we must re-evaluate the reading frame starting from the `AUG` start codon. The insertion of a single nucleotide shifts the reading frame for all subsequent codons. This phenomenon is known as a frameshift mutation.\n\nThe new sequence of codons is:\n- `AUG` (The start codon remains unchanged.)\n- `GAA` (The new first codon after the start, formed from the inserted G and the following AA.)\n- `CCC` (Formed from the original C and the following CC.)\n- `GUU` (Formed from the original G and the following UU.)\n- `AUA` (Formed from the original A and the following UA.)\n- `GGC` (Formed from the original G and the following GC.)\n- `UAG` (The final codon is now the stop codon.)\n\n**Step 3: Translate the mutated mRNA sequence.**\n\nUsing the provided genetic code table, we translate the new codon sequence:\n- `AUG` -> Methionine (Met)\n- `GAA` -> Glutamic Acid (Glu)\n- `CCC` -> Proline (Pro)\n- `GUU` -> Valine (Val)\n- `AUA` -> Isoleucine (Ile)\n- `GGC` -> Glycine (Gly)\n- `UAG` -> STOP\n\nThe ribosome will translate the sequence until it reaches the `UAG` stop codon.

This task is performed by the spliceosome, which recognizes specific landmarks at intron-exon boundaries. This practice problem [@problem_id:2116518] moves beyond simple pattern recognition to explore the chemical mechanism at the heart of the spliceosome, asking you to deduce the outcome when a critical nucleophile, the branch point adenosine, is inactivated.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the process of converting a gene's genetic code into a functional protein involves transcribing Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) into a precursor messenger Ribonucleic Acid (pre-mRNA). This pre-mRNA molecule contains both protein-coding regions, known as exons, and non-coding intervening regions, known as introns. Before this transcript can be translated into a protein, it must undergo a process called splicing, where the introns are precisely removed and the exons are ligated together to form a mature messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA).\n\nThis intricate cutting and pasting task is performed by a large molecular machine called the spliceosome. The spliceosome recognizes specific consensus sequences within the pre-mRNA to identify the boundaries of an intron. These key sequences are:\n1.  The **5' splice site**, located at the 5' end of the intron.\n2.  The **3' splice site**, located at the 3' end of the intron.\n3.  The **branch point sequence**, located within the intron (typically 15-45 nucleotides upstream of the 3' splice site), which contains a critical adenosine (A) nucleotide.\n\nThe splicing reaction proceeds in two main chemical steps. In the first step, the 2'-hydroxyl group of the branch point adenosine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the phosphodiester bond at the 5' splice site. This cleaves the upstream exon from the intron and forms a characteristic lariat-shaped intermediate.\n\nConsider a hypothetical eukaryotic gene that contains two exons (Exon 1 and Exon 2) separated by a single intron. A researcher introduces a point mutation that alters the branch point sequence within this intron so that it is no longer recognized by the spliceosome. All other sequences, including the 5' and 3' splice sites, remain intact and functional.\n\nWhat is the most likely outcome for the final mRNA transcript produced from this mutated gene after it undergoes nuclear processing?\n\nA. The intron will be correctly spliced out, as the 5' and 3' splice sites are sufficient for the spliceosome to recognize and remove the intron.\n\nB. The spliceosome will utilize a random adenosine nucleotide within the intron as a substitute branch point, leading to an unpredictably altered but spliced mRNA.\n\nC. The intron will fail to be excised, resulting in a mature mRNA transcript that contains the entire, unprocessed intron sequence located between Exon 1 and Exon 2.\n\nD. The spliceosome will skip over the intron and the adjacent Exon 2, ligating Exon 1 directly to the next exon downstream in the gene, if one exists.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the fate of a pre-mRNA transcript when its intron's branch point sequence is mutated and rendered non-functional. To solve this, we must understand the sequential mechanism of splicing in detail.\n\nThe process of splicing, catalyzed by the spliceosome, is a two-step transesterification reaction.\n\nStep 1: The first transesterification reaction.\nThe spliceosome machinery assembles at the intron, recognizing the 5' splice site, the 3' splice site, and the branch point sequence. The first chemical step is initiated by the 2'-hydroxyl group ($2'$-OH) of a specific adenosine nucleotide within the branch point sequence. This $2'$-OH group performs a nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bond at the 5' splice site. This attack breaks the bond between the end of the first exon (Exon 1) and the beginning of the intron. A new phosphodiester bond is formed between the 5' end of the intron and the branch point adenosine, creating a looped structure called an intron lariat. The Exon 1 is left with a free 3'-hydroxyl group ($3'$-OH).\n\nStep 2: The second transesterification reaction.\nThe free $3'$-OH group of Exon 1 now acts as a nucleophile, attacking the phosphodiester bond at the 3' splice site (the boundary between the intron and Exon 2). This attack joins Exon 1 and Exon 2 together, forming a continuous coding sequence. Concurrently, the intron is released as a lariat, which is subsequently degraded.\n\nAnalysis of the mutation's effect:\nThe problem states that the branch point sequence is inactivated by a mutation. The branch point adenosine is not merely a recognition site; it is an active chemical participant in the very first catalytic step of splicing. Its $2'$-OH group is the nucleophile that initiates the entire process.\n\nIf the spliceosome cannot recognize the branch point, or if the critical adenosine is altered, the first transesterification reaction cannot occur. The nucleophilic attack on the 5' splice site will fail. Without the successful completion of this first step, the second step (ligation of the exons) cannot be initiated because the necessary nucleophile—the free 3'-OH group of Exon 1—is never generated.\n\nTherefore, the splicing reaction is stalled at its inception for this particular intron. The pre-mRNA molecule may still undergo other processing events like 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation, but the intron will remain within the transcript. The final processed mRNA that is exported to the cytoplasm for translation will be aberrant, containing the sequence of Exon 1, followed by the entire unspliced intron, followed by the sequence of Exon 2.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this understanding:\nA. This is incorrect. The branch point is absolutely essential for the first catalytic step of splicing. The 5' and 3' splice sites alone are not sufficient.\nB. This is less likely to be the primary outcome. While the use of \"cryptic\" splice sites can occur, the question states the canonical branch point is *inactivated*, making a complete failure of the reaction the most direct and highly probable consequence. Random substitution is not the default mechanism.\nC. This correctly describes the consequence of blocking the first step of splicing. The spliceosome fails to catalyze the excision, and the intron is retained in the final mRNA product. This is the most direct and certain outcome.\nD. This describes an event called exon skipping, which is a different type of splicing error. It's not the direct consequence of inactivating a branch point within the adjacent intron. Such an event would typically be caused by mutations that weaken the splice sites flanking the skipped exon.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is the retention of the intron in the final mRNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2116518"}, {"introduction": "Large macromolecular machines do not spontaneously materialize; they are constructed through intricate, chaperon-guided assembly pathways.

Its cylindrical structure is formed by four stacked heptameric rings in an α-β-β-α arrangement. The two outer α-rings (composed of subunits α1-α7) act as a gate, while the two inner β-rings (subunits β1-β7) contain the proteolytic active sites. The assembly of this large complex is a highly regulated process, guided by a suite of dedicated assembly chaperones (PACs) and a maturation factor, POMP (Proteasome Maturation Protein), also known as Ump1. The β-subunits are synthesized as inactive precursors with N-terminal propeptides, which must be autocatalytically cleaved to form the active sites.\n\nA research group has conducted a series of biochemical and cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) experiments to elucidate the assembly pathway. Their findings are summarized below.\n\n**Hypothetical Experimental Findings:**\n\n1.  **Fraction I:** When cell lysates were fractionated, a stable complex was isolated containing all seven α-subunits (α1-α7) along with the chaperones PAC1 and PAC2. cryo-EM analysis of this complex revealed a single, complete heptameric α-ring.\n\n2.  **Fraction II:** A separate, less stable complex was identified containing a mixture of unprocessed β-subunits, the chaperones PAC3 and PAC4, and the maturation factor POMP. This complex appeared structurally heterogeneous, resembling an incomplete heptameric ring.\n\n3.  **Fraction III:** In a pulse-chase experiment where labeled β-subunits are incorporated, a large intermediate species is observed that contains two complete α-rings, two complete β-rings, and two molecules of POMP. In this state, the β-subunits still possess their propeptides. The two POMP molecules are located in the central chamber, each stretching across the interface between the two β-rings.\n\n4.  **Fraction IV:** Under conditions that stall the assembly process, a major intermediate accumulates. This \"half-proteasome\" consists of one complete PAC1-PAC2-bound α-ring, one complete PAC3-PAC4-POMP-bound β-ring (with unprocessed β-subunits), but PAC1 and PAC2 are no longer associated with the complex. POMP's structure within this complex suggests it acts as a temporary placeholder, preventing a second α-ring from binding to the exposed face of the β-ring.\n\n5.  **Fraction V:** The final isolated and active 20S proteasome contains no chaperones and no POMP. Further experiments show that the autocatalytic cleavage of the β-subunit propeptides only occurs in a fully assembled, dimeric α-β-β-α intermediate. This cleavage event also triggers the rapid degradation of the entrapped POMP molecules, followed by the release of PAC3 and PAC4.\n\nBased on these findings, determine the correct chronological sequence of the following key events in the 20S proteasome assembly pathway.\n\n**Assembly Events:**\n\n*   **A.** Formation of a complete, stable heptameric α-ring facilitated by PAC1 and PAC2.\n*   **B.** Association of precursor β-subunits with chaperones PAC3, PAC4, and the maturation factor POMP to form a nascent β-ring complex.\n*   **C.** Association of a complete α-ring with a complete β-ring precursor complex to form a stable \"half-proteasome\" intermediate, accompanied by the release of PAC1 and PAC2.\n*   **D.** Dimerization of two half-proteasome intermediates to form the full, but inactive, α-β-β-α pre-proteasome, entrapping two POMP molecules.\n*   **E.** Autocatalytic cleavage of β-subunit propeptides, activation of proteolytic sites, subsequent degradation of POMP, and release of the remaining chaperones.\n\nWhich of the following represents the correct temporal order of these events?\n\nA. B → A → C → D → E\n\nB. A → B → C → E → D\n\nC. A → C → B → D → E\n\nD. A → B → C → D → E\n\nE. B → C → A → D → E\n\nF. A → B → D → C → E", "solution": "We interpret each experimental fraction in terms of the defined assembly events and then order the events by the temporal constraints provided.\n\nFirst, Fraction I isolates a stable complex with all seven α-subunits and PAC1/PAC2 forming one complete heptameric α-ring. This directly corresponds to Event A (formation of a complete, stable heptameric α-ring facilitated by PAC1 and PAC2). Because this complex is stable and discrete, it represents an early and well-defined assembly step.\n\nSecond, Fraction II captures a less stable complex comprising unprocessed β-subunits with PAC3, PAC4, and POMP, forming an incomplete heptameric ring. This matches Event B (association of precursor β-subunits with PAC3, PAC4, and POMP to form a nascent β-ring complex). The presence of POMP at this stage is consistent with its role as a maturation factor associated with β-ring precursors.\n\nThird, Fraction IV reveals a “half-proteasome” that contains one complete α-ring and one PAC3-PAC4-POMP-bound β-ring with unprocessed β-subunits, and importantly, PAC1 and PAC2 are no longer associated. This is exactly Event C (association of a complete α-ring with a complete β-ring precursor complex to form a stable half-proteasome) coupled with the release of PAC1 and PAC2. The structural observation that POMP prevents a second α-ring from binding to the exposed β-ring face further supports this being the single-capped half-proteasome stage.\n\nFourth, Fraction III shows a large intermediate containing two complete α-rings and two complete β-rings, along with two POMP molecules located in the central chamber, with β-subunits still unprocessed. This is Event D (dimerization of two half-proteasomes to yield the full, but inactive, α-β-β-α pre-proteasome that entraps two POMP molecules). The unprocessed state of the β-subunits confirms that activation has not yet occurred at this stage.\n\nFifth, Fraction V demonstrates that the final active 20S proteasome is devoid of chaperones and POMP, and that autocatalytic cleavage of β-subunit propeptides occurs only after the fully assembled dimeric intermediate forms. This is Event E (autocatalytic propeptide removal, activation of proteolytic sites, rapid degradation of POMP, and release of remaining chaperones). The dependency of cleavage on the dimerized state forces D to precede E.\n\nCollectively, these map the temporal order as A (stable α-ring) → B (nascent β-ring with PAC3/4 and POMP) → C (half-proteasome with release of PAC1/2 and POMP acting as a placeholder) → D (dimerization to the full pre-proteasome entrapping two POMP) → E (autocatalytic activation, POMP degradation, and chaperone release). This sequence matches option D.\n\nTo exclude alternatives:\n- Options with E before D (e.g., B) are incompatible with the explicit requirement that autocatalytic cleavage occurs only in the dimerized intermediate.\n- Options placing C before B (e.g., C, E) are impossible because the half-proteasome requires a prior β-ring precursor complex.\n- Options placing D before C (e.g., F) are impossible because dimerization requires two half-proteasomes.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is A → B → C → D → E, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2116549"}]}
