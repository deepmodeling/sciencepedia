This problem delves into the biophysical principles governing antibody-antigen recognition, focusing on the critical role of specific chemical interactions like salt bridges. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario where a single amino acid mutation in a viral protein abolishes antibody binding, you will gain insight into the molecular basis of binding affinity and the mechanisms by which pathogens can evolve to escape the immune response [@problem_id:2140211].", "problem": "A team of virologists is studying the interaction between a novel monoclonal antibody, mAb-2B7, and a specific epitope on the Hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of the Aurelian Flu Virus (AFV). Structural analysis of the antibody-antigen complex reveals that the binding is primarily stabilized by a small number of key interactions within the antibody's Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs).\n\nThe most critical interaction for binding affinity is a salt bridge formed between the side chain of Arginine at position 98 (Arg-98) on the antibody's heavy chain and the side chain of Aspartic Acid at position 124 (Asp-124) on the viral HE protein. A secondary, less critical interaction involves a hydrogen bond between a Glutamine on the antibody and a Tyrosine on the HE protein at a different location within the epitope.\n\nResearchers discover a new, antibody-resistant strain of AFV. Sequencing reveals a single point mutation in the HE protein gene, resulting in the substitution of Aspartic Acid at position 124 with an Alanine (a D124A mutation). Experimental assays confirm that mAb-2B7 can no longer bind to the HE protein of this new strain.\n\nAssuming the antibody mAb-2B7 remains unchanged, what is the primary biophysical reason for the abolition of mAb-2B7 binding to the mutated HE protein?\n\nA. The mutation eliminates a critical electrostatic interaction (salt bridge) between the epitope and the antibody's CDR.\n\nB. The larger side chain of Alanine compared to Aspartic Acid introduces a steric clash that prevents the antibody from docking correctly.\n\nC. The mutation disrupts a network of stabilizing hydrogen bonds involving the residue at position 124.\n\nD. The mutation causes a global conformational change in the entire HE protein, which indirectly alters the shape of the epitope.\n\nE. The mutation replaces a polar residue with a non-polar one, causing the epitope to be buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein.", "solution": "We are told the highest-affinity interaction is a salt bridge between Arg-98 on the antibody and Asp-124 on the HE protein epitope. A salt bridge is a strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged side chains. In this case, the guanidinium group of arginine carries a positive charge and the carboxylate of aspartate carries a negative charge. The dominant physical principle is Coulombic attraction, with pairwise interaction energy scaling as\n$$\nE_{\\text{Coul}} \\propto \\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r} r},\n$$\nwhere $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are the charges of the interacting groups, $r$ is their separation, and $\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}$ accounts for the dielectric environment. The D124A mutation replaces a negatively charged aspartate ($q_{2}<0$) with a neutral alanine ($q_{2}\\approx 0$), thereby eliminating this favorable electrostatic term.\n\nThe overall binding free energy can be represented as a sum of contributions,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{electrostatic}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{H-bond}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{vdW}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{desolvation}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{conformational}} + \\cdots.\n$$\nBecause the salt bridge was identified as the critical stabilizing interaction, the D124A mutation removes a major favorable $\\Delta G_{\\text{electrostatic}}$ contribution. The secondary hydrogen bond (between a glutamine and a tyrosine at a different epitope location) remains unchanged and is insufficient to compensate for the loss of the salt bridge, consistent with the observed abolition of binding.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is correct: replacing Asp with Ala at position 124 removes the negative charge and thus abolishes the salt bridge with Arg-98, eliminating the dominant electrostatic attraction.\n- B is incorrect: alanine has a smaller side chain than aspartic acid; it does not introduce a steric clash and, if anything, creates a small cavity rather than hindrance.\n- C is not the primary reason: while Asp can participate in hydrogen bonding, the problem states the critical interaction is the salt bridge; the secondary hydrogen bond mentioned is at a different site and is less critical.\n- D is unlikely: a single conservative-to-nonpolar surface mutation rarely induces a global conformational change of the entire protein; the observed effect is better explained by the direct loss of the key contact.\n- E is not the main effect: substituting a surface polar residue with alanine does not generally cause the entire epitope to bury in the hydrophobic core; the immediate and sufficient cause for loss of binding is the loss of charge and thus the salt bridge.\n\nTherefore, the primary biophysical reason is the elimination of the critical electrostatic salt bridge interaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2140211"}, {"introduction": "Beyond antibody-mediated immunity, the adaptive immune system relies on T-cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize foreign peptides presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. This exercise explores the unique structural rules that govern peptide-MHC binding, a system fundamentally different from antibody-antigen recognition.
