Initial automatic indexing procedures suggest two possible unit cells that fit the data reasonably well.\n\nCase 1: A monoclinic unit cell with parameters $a=49.8$ Å, $b=101.2$ Å, $c=55.1$ Å, and angles $\\alpha = \\gamma = 90^{\\circ}$, $\\beta = 90.5^{\\circ}$.\nCase 2: An orthorhombic unit cell with parameters $a=49.8$ Å, $b=101.2$ Å, $c=55.1$ Å, and angles $\\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 90^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe crystallographer proceeds to analyze the intensity statistics to check for pathologies. When the data is processed in the orthorhombic setting, statistical tests for twinning, such as an analysis of the cumulative intensity distribution, return a strong positive signal indicating the likely presence of twinning. However, when the same tests are applied assuming the monoclinic setting, the results are negative.\n\nBased on this information, what is the most scientifically sound conclusion about the true nature of the crystal?\n\nA. The orthorhombic space group is the correct choice, as it possesses higher symmetry, and one should always choose the highest possible symmetry that fits the cell parameters.\nB. The true space group of the crystal is likely monoclinic, and the apparent orthorhombic symmetry is an artifact caused by twinning.\nC. The data is fundamentally flawed due to the twinning, and therefore neither indexing scheme can be trusted. The experiment must be repeated with a new crystal.\nD. The ambiguity cannot be resolved with the given information. The structure must be solved and refined independently in both space groups to see which one yields a better final model.", "solution": "The central issue in this problem is to correctly interpret the relationship between crystal symmetry, unit cell indexing, and the phenomenon of twinning.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the relationship between the two proposed unit cells.\nThe monoclinic unit cell has parameters $a \\neq b \\neq c$ and $\\alpha = \\gamma = 90^{\\circ}, \\beta \\neq 90^{\\circ}$. The orthorhombic unit cell has parameters $a \\neq b \\neq c$ and $\\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 90^{\\circ}$. The proposed monoclinic cell has an angle $\\beta = 90.5^{\\circ}$, which is very close to the $90^{\\circ}$ required for an orthorhombic cell. This situation, where a lower-symmetry cell metrically approximates a higher-symmetry cell, is a classic precondition for a specific type of twinning known as pseudo-merohedral twinning.\n\nStep 2: Understand the role of twinning.\nCrystallographic twinning occurs when two or more distinct crystal lattices are intergrown in a specific, symmetrical orientation. A key consequence of twinning is that the diffraction pattern from the composite crystal can exhibit a higher symmetry than the true symmetry of the individual crystals. In this case, the twinning of a monoclinic crystal (where the twin operation relates two lattices) can produce a diffraction pattern that appears to have orthorhombic symmetry. The slight deviation of the $\\beta$ angle from $90^{\\circ}$ is obscured by the overlapping diffraction spots from the twinned domains.\n\nStep 3: Interpret the twinning tests.\nStatistical tests for twinning are designed to detect abnormalities in intensity distributions that arise from such overlaps. The problem states that when the data is treated as orthorhombic, the twinning tests are positive. This is a critical piece of evidence. It means that the observed reflection intensities are not consistent with those expected from a single, untwinned orthorhombic crystal. Instead, the intensity distribution matches the pattern expected from a twinned crystal of a related, lower-symmetry space group—in this case, monoclinic. The fact that the tests are negative for the monoclinic case indicates that the intensity distribution is perfectly normal and consistent with an untwinned crystal *of that symmetry*.\n\nStep 4: Synthesize the evidence to reach a conclusion.\nThe combined evidence points strongly to one conclusion: the crystal's true symmetry is monoclinic. The ability to index the data as orthorhombic, and the positive twinning test in that context, are not evidence for orthorhombic symmetry. Instead, they are classic symptoms of a twinned monoclinic crystal mimicking a higher symmetry. The principle of selecting the highest possible symmetry applies only when it is fully consistent with *all* the experimental data, including the intensity statistics. The positive twinning test shows that the orthorhombic hypothesis is inconsistent with the intensity data.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\nA. This option is incorrect. While the principle of choosing the highest symmetry is a general guideline, it is overridden when there is direct evidence (the positive twinning test) that this higher symmetry is an artifact.\nB. This option correctly synthesizes all the information. The true symmetry is the lower one (monoclinic), and the twinning phenomenon explains why it could be mistaken for the higher symmetry (orthorhombic).\nC. This option is an overreaction. Twinning is a common problem in crystallography, and while it complicates structure solution, modern software contains tools to handle twinned data. The data is not necessarily \"flawed\" or \"untrustable.\"\nD. While solving the structure in both systems is a potential validation step, it is not the initial conclusion. The provided data from the twinning tests is sufficient to make a strong, reasoned choice about which path is the most likely to be correct. The most likely conclusion based on the initial analysis is that the space group is monoclinic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2098606"}, {"introduction": "Once twinning has been identified as a factor, it is essential to quantify its extent using the twin fraction, $\\alpha$.

During data processing, the software indicates the presence of merohedral twinning and calculates a twin fraction of $\\alpha = 0.3$. Based on this information, what is the relationship between the volume of the major twin domain (the larger domain) and the volume of the minor twin domain (the smaller domain)?\n\nA. The volume of the major domain is 3/7 times the volume of the minor domain.\nB. The volume of the major domain is 7/10 times the volume of the minor domain.\nC.

The observation described—significant negative density centered on the modeled positions of the leucine terminal methyls (C$_{\\delta1}$ and C$_{\\delta2}$) immediately adjacent to significant positive density of similar magnitude—is the textbook signature of a coordinate error that can be corrected by shifting the atoms toward the positive peak. This is particularly common for side-chain rotamer adjustments.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\n- A: Replacing leucine with isoleucine would change the branching at C$_{\\beta}$ and the positions of side-chain atoms in a more complex way than a simple local shift at the methyl tips; it would not typically present as a clean adjacent negative-positive pair only at the terminal methyl positions. The described features are more consistent with a rotameric/positional shift rather than residue identity.\n\n- B: If B-factors are too high, $|F_\\text{c}|$ would be too small at the atom locations, typically yielding positive residual density at the modeled positions (missing calculated density), not negative. If B-factors were too low, one could see negative at the atom positions, but that would not by itself explain a well-localized adjacent positive peak; the paired negative-positive lobe of similar magnitude is characteristic of a positional shift rather than purely an isotropic B-factor error.\n\n- C: A slight coordinate error of the side chain causing the methyls to be misplaced will produce negative density at their current positions and positive density where they should be. The remedy is to shift the side chain into the positive density (often into a better rotamer). This directly matches the observation.\n\n- D: An unmodeled water would produce a positive peak where the water should be, not a negative peak on the methyl carbons. Moreover, water near hydrophobic leucine methyls is less likely, and this would not explain the paired negative directly on the methyls.\n\n- E: The features are described as significant and structured (negative on the model, positive adjacent), which is not consistent with random noise.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and likely interpretation is that the leucine side-chain coordinates are slightly incorrect and should be shifted into the positive density.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2098634"}]}
