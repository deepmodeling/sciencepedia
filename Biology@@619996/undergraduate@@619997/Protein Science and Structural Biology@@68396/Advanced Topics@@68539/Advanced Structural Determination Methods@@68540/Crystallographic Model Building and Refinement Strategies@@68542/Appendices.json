This includes bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles. One of the most common covalent cross-links in proteins is the disulfide bridge (or disulfide bond), which is formed by the oxidation of the thiol groups of two cysteine residues.\n\nThe question asks for the expected bond length of the sulfur-sulfur (S-S) covalent bond in such a bridge. We must evaluate the given options based on established values from high-resolution structural studies.\n\n- **Step 1: Identify the bond in question.**\nThe bond is a single covalent bond between two sulfur atoms, forming a cystine residue from two cysteine residues.\n\n- **Step 2: Recall or look up the standard bond length for an S-S bond.**\nThe length of a covalent bond depends on the atoms involved and the bond order. For a single covalent bond between two sulfur atoms, as found in a disulfide bridge, the accepted average bond length is approximately 2.05 Å. High-resolution protein structures show this value typically ranges from about 2.0 Å to 2.1 Å.\n\n- **Step 3: Evaluate the given options against the known value.**\nWe are looking for the option closest to the standard value of ~2.05 Å.\n\n- **Option A: 1.5 Å.** This value is characteristic of a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C), such as the Cα-Cβ bond in an amino acid side chain, which has an average length of about 1.52 Å. This is incorrect for an S-S bond.\n\n- **Option B: 1.8 Å.** This value is the approximate bond length for a carbon-sulfur single bond (C-S), like the Cβ-Sγ bond within a single cysteine or methionine residue. It is a common and plausible distractor but is not the correct length for an S-S bond.\n\n- **Option C: 2.0 Å.** This value is very close to the accepted average of 2.05 Å for a disulfide bond and falls well within the expected range. It is the most chemically realistic value among the choices.\n\n- **Option D: 2.9 Å.** This distance is significantly longer than any typical single covalent bond found in proteins. It is, however, a very typical distance for a hydrogen bond between a donor and an acceptor atom (e.g., N-H···O or O-H···O), which usually range from 2.7 Å to 3.3 Å. This represents a non-covalent interaction, not a covalent bond.\n\n- **Option E: 3.5 Å.** This distance is at the upper limit of van der Waals contact for two sulfur atoms and is far too long for a covalent bond. Interactions at this distance would be non-bonding.\n\n- **Step 4: Conclude the correct answer.**\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate and expected bond length for a disulfide S-S bond from the given options is 2.0 Å. Verifying that such key geometric features are within their expected ranges is a fundamental step in crystallographic model building and refinement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2107395"}, {"introduction": "Model building is not a one-shot process but an iterative cycle of building and refining. A crystallographer's most powerful guide in this cycle is the difference Fourier map ($F_o - F_c$), which highlights discrepancies between the model ($F_c$) and the experimental data ($F_o$). This practice challenges you to interpret the distinct positive and negative signals in a difference map to diagnose and correct a common but subtle modeling error, a key skill for producing an accurate final structure [@problem_id:2107394].", "problem": "In the process of building an atomic model for a newly determined protein crystal structure, a crystallographer encounters a region of unassigned electron density. Based on the shape of the density, they build a glutamine (Gln) side chain into it. Following a round of computational refinement, the crystallographer examines a difference Fourier map, commonly denoted as an $F_o - F_c$ map. In this map, $F_o$ represents the structure factor amplitudes derived from the experimental diffraction data, while $F_c$ represents the structure factor amplitudes calculated from the current atomic model.\n\nThe map reveals two prominent features in the region of the newly built Gln side chain:\n1.  Strong negative density (where $F_c > F_o$) is observed, forming a \"cage\" that precisely overlaps with the positions of the terminal atoms ($C_{\\delta}$, $O_{\\epsilon1}$, $N_{\\epsilon2}$) of the modeled glutamine side chain.\n2.

The glutamine side chain is in an incorrect rotameric conformation; it should be rotated around one of its chi angles to better fit the density.\n\nC. The atomic displacement parameters (B-factors) for the side chain atoms are set too low; they should be increased to account for more thermal motion.\n\nD.

A strong negative density \"cage\" exactly overlapping the modeled Gln terminal atoms ($C_{\\delta}$, $O_{\\epsilon 1}$, $N_{\\epsilon 2}$) implies that the current model has placed too much electron density at those specific positions, i.e., those atoms as placed are not supported by the data.\n2. A distinct, strong positive density blob appears adjacent to the Gln side chain, located roughly one C–C bond length closer to $C_{\\beta}$ along the side-chain axis.

If a Gln is modeled where an Asn should be, the modeled terminal atoms would be placed too far from $C_{\\beta}$ by approximately one C–C bond length, producing negative density at the modeled Gln terminal atom positions and positive density one methylene closer—precisely the observed pattern.\n\nWe exclude alternatives:\n- An incorrect rotamer (option B) would typically produce positive density at a rotated position at roughly the same radial distance from the preceding atom, not a systematic shift exactly one C–C bond length closer along the axis.\n- B-factors too low (option C) can yield negative density at atom sites, but the compensating positive features would not localize as a single strong blob precisely one bond closer along the axis; rather, they would more diffusely surround the atoms.\n- Glutamate (option D) has the same side-chain length as glutamine (both have two methylenes before the terminal group); changing amide to carboxylate does not shorten the side chain by one methylene and thus would not produce the observed axial inward shift of positive density.\n- Low resolution ambiguity and alanine truncation (option E) are not supported by the presence of strong, specific positive and negative features that diagnose a side-chain length mismatch.\n\nTherefore, the most probable error is that the side chain was misidentified as glutamine when it is actually asparagine, and the corrective action is to change the model to Asn.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2107394"}, {"introduction": "Sometimes, even a geometrically sound model fails to refine well, pointing to underlying issues not in the model, but in the diffraction data itself.
