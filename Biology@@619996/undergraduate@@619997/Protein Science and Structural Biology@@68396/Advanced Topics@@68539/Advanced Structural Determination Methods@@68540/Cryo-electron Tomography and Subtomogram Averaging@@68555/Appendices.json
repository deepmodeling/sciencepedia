Cryo-ET produces 3D reconstructions, known as tomograms, of the cell. However, these tomograms have a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which makes individual protein complexes difficult to discern.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, the researcher employs a technique called subtomogram averaging. This process involves locating multiple copies of the same protein complex within the tomograms, computationally extracting these small volumes (subtomograms), aligning them, and then averaging them together. The underlying principle is that the \"signal\" from the protein complex is consistent across all aligned subtomograms, while the \"noise\" is random and uncorrelated. By averaging many noisy copies of the same object, the consistent signal is reinforced while the random noise tends to cancel out.\n\nInitially, the researcher averages $N$ subtomograms, resulting in a final 3D structure with a certain signal-to-noise ratio, which we'll denote as $\\text{SNR}_{N}$. To improve the resolution and clarity of the structure, the researcher decides to collect more data and doubles the number of subtomograms included in the average to $2N$. Assuming the noise in each subtomogram is random and uncorrelated, by what factor does the new signal-to-noise ratio, $\\text{SNR}_{2N}$, change compared to the original $\\text{SNR}_{N}$?\n\nA.

The channel is hypothesized to exist in a closed (apo) state and an open state, which is induced by the binding of a small molecule, \"LigandA.\" To test this, the group prepares two sets of samples: one in the absence of LigandA and one saturated with LigandA. After data collection, subtomograms corresponding to individual channel particles are extracted and subjected to 3D classification and averaging. This process yields three distinct structural classes, labeled Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3.\n\nThe researchers formulate the following hypotheses about the identities of these classes:\n- **Class 1:** Represents the stable, closed apo-conformation of IonChannelX.\n- **Class 2:** Is a processing artifact, resulting from the erroneous inclusion of non-channel features, membrane defects, or misaligned particles.\n- **Class 3:** Represents the LigandA-bound, open conformation of the channel.\n\nWhich of the following sets of analytical observations would provide the most definitive and comprehensive evidence to simultaneously support all three of these hypotheses?\n\nA. In the dataset without LigandA, Class 1 accounts for ~90% of particles, while Class 3 is negligible. In the dataset with LigandA, the population of Class 3 rises to ~70%. The 3D map of Class 1 is well-resolved and shows a closed pore. The map of Class 2 has very low resolution and a poor Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) score. The map of Class 3 is also well-resolved, shows an open pore, and contains a distinct, non-protein density within the known binding site that fits the molecular shape of LigandA.\n\nB.

Class 1 is well-resolved with a closed pore. Class 2 is low-resolution with poor Fourier Shell Correlation, consistent with an artifact. Class 3 is well-resolved, shows an open pore, and contains distinct extra density at the known binding pocket fitting LigandA. This set directly demonstrates apo-closed dominance in the absence of ligand, ligand-induced shift to the open state, structural signatures of open and closed pores at good resolution, and explicit ligand density; it also flags Class 2 as an artifact via poor reconstruction metrics. This satisfies all three hypotheses comprehensively.\n- Option B: Class 2 and Class 3 maps are essentially the same as Class 1, with differences only in resolution or angle distribution, and Class 3’s population does not change with ligand. There is no ligand density and no conformational change, so neither the open-state assignment nor the artifact hypothesis is supported.\n- Option C: Class 2 is a well-resolved structure of a different protein, which is contamination rather than a processing artifact; Class 3 does not increase with LigandA and lacks ligand density. This fails the Class 2 and Class 3 hypotheses.\n- Option D: Populations do not change with ligand; Class 3 shows a closed pore despite a ligand density. This contradicts the expected open conformation and provides no support for Class 1 dominance without ligand or for Class 2 as artifact.\n- Option E: External single-particle evidence supports the open/closed assignments in general, but within the cryo-electron tomography analysis, Class 2 is most populous and is not shown to be an artifact; also, the ligand-induced population shift within the tomography dataset is not shown. Thus it does not simultaneously validate all three hypotheses in the given experiment.\n\nTherefore, the only option that provides definitive, comprehensive, and internally consistent evidence for all three hypotheses is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2106573"}]}
