To assess the quality of the atomic model presented in the paper, the student examines the validation statistics table.\n\nThe problem statement must be entirely self-contained, so here are the necessary definitions:\n- **Resolution**: A measure of the level of detail in the final electron density map, given in units of Ångstroms (Å). A lower numerical value corresponds to a higher resolution (more detail).\n- **R-factor (or R-work)**: A metric that quantifies the agreement between the coordinates of the atomic model and the experimental X-ray diffraction data that was used to build and refine the model. A lower R-factor generally indicates a better fit of the model to the data it was refined against.\n- **R-free**: A crucial cross-validation metric. It is calculated in the same way as the R-factor, but using a small subset of the diffraction data (typically 5-10%) that was intentionally excluded from the refinement process. It measures how well the model predicts data it has not \"seen\" before.\n\nThe paper reports that the final model was refined to a resolution of 2.0 Å, with a final R-factor of 0.22 and an R-free of 0.21.\n\nBased on these three values (Resolution, R-factor, R-free), which of the following statements represents the most significant and immediate reason to be suspicious of the reported model and its validation?\n\nA. The resolution of 2.0 Å is too low to build a scientifically meaningful atomic model.\n\nB. The R-factor and R-free values are both above 0.20, which is generally considered the maximum acceptable threshold for a high-quality structure, regardless of resolution.\n\nC. The R-free value is lower than the R-factor value, suggesting a potential flaw in the refinement or validation procedure.\n\nD. The difference between the R-free and R-factor is only 0.01, which is too small and indicates that the model is severely over-fitted to the experimental data.", "solution": "Given the definitions, the key validation principles are:\n1) Resolution: Lower numerical values correspond to higher detail. A resolution of 2.0 angstroms is considered sufficiently high to construct and validate a reliable atomic model; thus, such a value is not inherently suspicious.\n2) R-factor and R-free: For a properly validated model, the cross-validation metric should satisfy $R_\\text{free} \\geq R_\\text{work}$, because $R_\\text{work}$ is computed on data used in refinement, while $R_\\text{free}$ is computed on a held-out test set. Over-fitting typically manifests as $R_\\text{work}$ decreasing more than $R_\\text{free}$, increasing the gap $R_\\text{free} - R_\\text{work}$.\n3) Typical ranges at approximately 2.0 angstroms: It is common for $R_\\text{work}$ to lie around 0.18 to 0.24 and $R_\\text{free}$ around 0.20 to 0.27, with an expected positive gap $R_\\text{free} - R_\\text{work}$ on the order of roughly 0.02 to 0.07. These are empirical expectations rather than strict rules, but they guide suspicion.\n\nApply to the reported values:\n- Resolution: 2.0 angstroms is acceptable and not a red flag. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.\n- Absolute values of R-factors: $R_\\text{work} = 0.22$ and $R_\\text{free} = 0.21$ are not automatically disqualifying at 2.0 angstroms; a fixed universal threshold of 0.20 regardless of resolution is not valid. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.\n- Relative ordering: Compute the difference $\\Delta R = R_\\text{free} - R_\\text{work} = 0.21 - 0.22 = -0.01$. The negative value violates the expected inequality $R_\\text{free} \\geq R_\\text{work}$. This is a direct and immediate red flag suggesting problems such as leakage of test reflections into refinement or otherwise flawed cross-validation. Therefore, statement C identifies the most significant and immediate reason for suspicion.\n- Gap size interpretation: A small gap of magnitude $|\\Delta R| = 0.01$ does not indicate severe over-fitting; severe over-fitting typically produces a larger positive gap (with $R_\\text{work}$ much smaller than $R_\\text{free}$). Thus, statement D is incorrect both in diagnosing the issue and in its directionality.\n\nTherefore, the most significant and immediate reason to be suspicious is that $R_\\text{free}$ is reported as lower than $R_\\text{work}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2120354"}]}
