One common method, known as Hydrogen/Deuterium (H/D) exchange, involves replacing labile hydrogen atoms (¹H) with their heavier isotope, deuterium (²H or D), to generate contrast in the diffraction experiment.\n\nThe scattering of neutrons by an atomic nucleus is characterized by its coherent scattering cross-section, $\\sigma$. The intensity of neutrons scattered from a single, isolated atom is directly proportional to its scattering cross-section.

To precisely locate this hydrogen atom, the biologist employs neutron diffraction, a technique sensitive to atomic nuclei.\n\nTwo sets of high-quality crystals of the enzyme are prepared. The first set, the H-sample, is grown in a buffer made with normal water ($H_2O$). The second set, the D-sample, is grown in a buffer made with heavy water ($D_2O$), causing all exchangeable protons, including the one on the serine hydroxyl group, to be replaced by deuterium.\n\nThe biologist then collects neutron diffraction data from both samples. To visualize the position of the hydroxyl proton/deuteron, they compute Fourier difference maps ($F_o - F_c$). For this calculation, a structural model is used to generate the calculated structure factors, $F_c$. This model is complete and accurate for all non-hydrogen atoms (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) but deliberately omits the atom at the position of the serine hydroxyl's labile hydrogen/deuterium. The observed structure factors, $F_o$, are taken from the experimental data of the H-sample and D-sample, respectively.\n\nThe coherent neutron scattering length, $b$, which determines the amplitude and phase of scattered neutron waves, is the key parameter for each atom type.

No distinct feature will be visible in the map from the H-sample due to overwhelming incoherent scattering, whereas a strong positive peak will be seen in the map from the D-sample.", "solution": "We use the definition of the nuclear structure factor for neutrons. For a set of atoms indexed by $j$ at positions $\\mathbf{x}_{j}$ with coherent scattering lengths $b_{j}$ and Debye–Waller factors $T_{j}(\\mathbf{h})$, the calculated structure factor is\n$$\nF_{c}(\\mathbf{h})=\\sum_{j} b_{j}\\,T_{j}(\\mathbf{h})\\,\\exp\\!\\left(2\\pi i\\,\\mathbf{h}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}_{j}\\right).\n$$\nIn the given setup, the model used to compute $F_{c}$ deliberately omits the hydroxyl H/D atom.

Therefore, the sign of the feature at the omitted atom’s position in the $F_{o}-F_{c}$ map is determined by $\\operatorname{sgn}(b_{j^{\\ast}})$:\n- For the H-sample, $b_{H}<0$, so the map shows a negative density trough at the hydroxyl hydrogen site.\n- For the D-sample, $b_{D}>0$, so the map shows a positive density peak at the hydroxyl deuterium site.\n\nThe oxygen’s scattering length does not change the sign inference at the omitted H/D site because oxygen is present in both $F_{o}$ and $F_{c}$ and thus cancels in $\\Delta F$. While incoherent scattering from hydrogen increases background and noise, it does not reverse the sign of the coherent difference feature at the correctly modeled resolution and data quality. Hence, the primary observable features are a negative trough for the H-sample and a positive peak for the D-sample at the omitted site.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that the H-sample map shows a significant negative density trough, while the D-sample map shows a significant positive density peak.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2122053"}, {"introduction": "The principles of neutron scattering and data interpretation become truly powerful when applied to biological questions, such as understanding protein stability. By soaking a protein in heavy water ($D_2O$), scientists can trigger a Hydrogen/Deuterium (H/D) exchange for solvent-accessible protons. This final practice challenges you to interpret the results of such an experiment, showing how the *lack* of exchange can reveal critical information about a protein's folded core and internal hydrogen-bonding network.", "problem": "Neutron diffraction is a powerful technique in structural biology for locating hydrogen atoms in proteins. This is because neutrons scatter differently from hydrogen (H, proton) and its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). In a typical Hydrogen-Deuterium (H/D) exchange experiment, a protein is first dissolved in a heavy water ($D_2O$) solvent for a specific period. During this time, solvent-accessible protons, particularly those on main-chain amide groups (part of the protein backbone), can be exchanged for deuterons from the solvent. The protein is then crystallized and analyzed.\n\nImagine such an experiment is performed on a globular protein. After incubation in $D_2O$, analysis of the neutron diffraction data reveals a specific main-chain amide proton located deep within the protein's hydrophobic core has not been exchanged for a deuteron. Based on this experimental observation, what is the most direct and likely inference about this specific proton and its local environment?\n\nA. The proton is located on the hydrophilic surface of the protein, readily accessible to the solvent.\n\nB. The proton is participating in a stable hydrogen bond within a regular secondary structure, such as an alpha-helix or beta-sheet, which is shielded from the solvent.\n\nC. The protein has become completely denatured during the experiment, exposing all its amide groups to the solvent.\n\nD. The proton is part of a highly flexible and disordered loop region of the protein.\n\nE. The amide group containing this proton is part of an amino acid that has an unusually high pKa, making the proton chemically impossible to exchange.", "solution": "The central principle of Hydrogen-Deuterium (H/D) exchange experiments is that the rate of exchange for a given proton is primarily determined by its solvent accessibility and its involvement in stable hydrogen bonds.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the experimental setup and observation. The protein is placed in a $D_2O$ solvent, which creates a large chemical potential gradient favoring the exchange of labile protons (like those on amide groups, $-\\text{NH}-$) with deuterons (D). The observation is that a specific main-chain amide proton in the protein's core did *not* exchange. This implies that the exchange process for this particular proton is extremely slow, on the timescale of the experiment.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this understanding:\n\nOption A states that the proton is on the hydrophilic surface. If a proton were on the surface, it would be highly accessible to the $D_2O$ solvent and would exchange very rapidly. This is the direct opposite of the observation. Thus, A is incorrect.\n\nOption C suggests the protein is denatured. Denaturation involves the unfolding of the protein, which would drastically increase the solvent accessibility of nearly all residues, including those originally in the core. If the protein were denatured, this amide proton (along with most others) would be exposed and would readily exchange with deuterium. This contradicts the observation. Thus, C is incorrect.\n\nOption D posits that the proton is in a highly flexible, disordered loop. Flexible and disordered regions of a protein, even if somewhat buried, experience conformational fluctuations that would transiently expose the amide proton to the solvent, facilitating exchange. While the exchange rate might be slower than for a surface proton, it would generally be much faster than for a proton locked in a stable, buried structure. The lack of exchange suggests a very rigid and protected environment, not a flexible one. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\nOption E suggests an unusual pKa prevents exchange. While the chemical nature (pKa) of the amide group is a factor in the base-catalyzed exchange mechanism, all main-chain amide protons have very similar chemical properties. The several orders of magnitude difference in exchange rates observed in proteins are overwhelmingly dominated by structural factors (solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding), not by intrinsic chemical differences between amide groups. A lack of exchange is a sign of physical protection, not unique chemical inertness. Thus, E is an unlikely explanation.\n\nOption B states that the proton is participating in a stable hydrogen bond within a regular secondary structure (like an alpha-helix or beta-sheet) and is shielded from the solvent. This scenario provides a complete explanation for the observation. Being \"shielded from the solvent\" (i.e., buried in the core) physically prevents $D_2O$ molecules from reaching the proton. Furthermore, being part of a stable hydrogen bond, which is characteristic of secondary structures, means the N-H bond is \"locked\" in place and is not free to interact with the solvent even if a water molecule were to transiently get nearby. This combination of being buried and being part of a stable hydrogen-bonded network makes the exchange rate extremely slow. This is the hallmark of the stable core of a folded protein. Therefore, this is the most direct and likely inference.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2122050"}]}
