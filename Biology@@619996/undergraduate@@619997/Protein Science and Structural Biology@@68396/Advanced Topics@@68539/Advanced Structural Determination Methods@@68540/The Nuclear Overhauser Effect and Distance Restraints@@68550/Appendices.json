The NOE provides a powerful set of 'ground truth' distance restraints, acting as a crucial check on the validity of a theoretical model. This practice problem [@problem_id:2144733] places you in a common scenario where a preliminary model directly contradicts the experimental NOESY data, forcing you to use fundamental principles to decide which piece of evidence to trust.", "problem": "In the process of determining the three-dimensional structure of a novel enzyme using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a structural biology team generates a preliminary computational model. A key part of structure validation involves comparing this model to experimental data from a 2D Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment.\n\nThe fundamental principle of the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is that its signal intensity between two protons is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance ($r$) separating them, i.e., $I_{NOE} \\propto 1/r^6$. Due to this steep distance dependence, a detectable NOE cross-peak is typically only observed for protons that are closer than approximately 5.0 Å.\n\nThe team's preliminary model predicts that the proton on the side chain of a Leucine residue (Leu-78) and a proton on the side chain of a Phenylalanine residue (Phe-150) are separated by a distance of 7.0 Å. However, the experimental NOESY spectrum shows a distinct and strong cross-peak connecting these two specific protons.\n\nGiven this direct contradiction between the computational model and the experimental data, what is the most scientifically sound conclusion?\n\nA. The preliminary computational model is incorrect in this region; the actual distance between the Leu-78 and Phe-150 protons in the folded enzyme must be significantly less than 7.0 Å.\n\nB.

The observed signal is not a through-space NOE but is instead a result of a through-bond J-coupling interaction between the two residues.\n\nD. The experimental cross-peak is most likely a random noise artifact, and the theoretically-derived computational model should be considered more reliable.\n\nE. The two protons are on separate enzyme molecules that have formed a dimer in the NMR sample, and the model, which represents a single molecule, is therefore not applicable.", "solution": "The problem presents a conflict between a theoretical prediction from a computational model and a direct experimental observation from a NOESY experiment. To resolve this, we must critically evaluate the underlying principles and the hierarchy of evidence in structural biology.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core principle of the NOE.**\nThe problem statement explicitly provides the governing physical relationship for the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE): the signal intensity ($I_{NOE}$) is proportional to the inverse sixth power of the distance ($r$) between the two protons.\n$$I_{NOE} \\propto \\frac{1}{r^{6}}$$\nThis relationship signifies an extremely sensitive dependence on distance. A small increase in distance leads to a dramatic decrease in signal intensity. For example, doubling the distance from 3 Å to 6 Å would decrease the expected NOE signal by a factor of $2^6 = 64$. This is why there is a practical upper limit for observing NOEs, stated in the problem as approximately 5.0 Å. Protons separated by more than this distance have an NOE that is too weak to be reliably detected above the background noise of the experiment.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the model's prediction with the experimental result.**\n-   **Model Prediction:** The distance between the specified protons on Leu-78 and Phe-150 is 7.0 Å. Based on the $1/r^6$ rule, a distance of 7.0 Å is well beyond the 5.0 Å cutoff, and therefore, no NOE signal should be observed.\n-   **Experimental Observation:** A \"distinct and strong\" NOE cross-peak is observed between these two protons. A strong signal is unequivocal evidence that the two protons are, in fact, very close to each other in three-dimensional space, certainly within the ~5.0 Å observable limit.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the discrepancy and evaluate the given options.**\nThe experimental data directly contradicts the prediction derived from the model. In scientific practice, direct, high-quality experimental evidence takes precedence over a preliminary theoretical model. The purpose of such experiments is precisely to test and refine these models.\n\n-   **Evaluation of Option A:** This option states that the model is incorrect and the actual distance is much smaller. This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The strong experimental NOE signal is direct proof that the protons are close. Therefore, the model's prediction of a 7.0 Å separation must be wrong. This is the standard interpretation in protein structure determination.\n\n-   **Evaluation of Option B:** This option suggests a different physical law ($I_{NOE} \\propto 1/r^2$). This contradicts the well-established and explicitly stated physical basis of the NOE ($1/r^6$). Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n-   **Evaluation of Option C:** This option confuses different types of NMR interactions. A NOESY experiment is specifically designed to measure through-space dipolar couplings (NOEs). Through-bond scalar couplings (J-couplings) are measured using different experiments, such as COSY or TOCSY. It is incorrect to interpret a NOESY cross-peak as a J-coupling. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n-   **Evaluation of Option D:** This option suggests dismissing the experimental data as an artifact in favor of the model. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the scientific method. While artifacts can occur, a \"distinct and strong\" signal is unlikely to be random noise. Furthermore, preliminary models are hypotheses to be tested, not infallible truths. The experimental data serves as the critical test. Therefore, this option reflects poor scientific reasoning.\n\n-   **Evaluation of Option E:** This option proposes that the NOE is intermolecular (between two different molecules) rather than intramolecular (within the same molecule). While such intermolecular effects can occur if the protein aggregates, the most direct and simplest explanation for a discrepancy in a monomeric model is that the model itself is flawed. Before invoking more complex scenarios like aggregation (which would typically be investigated by other means, like concentration-dependent NMR or light scattering), the primary conclusion is that the intramolecular distance in the model is wrong. Therefore, while plausible under certain conditions, it is not the *most* sound and immediate conclusion. Option A represents the most direct interpretation of the data in the context of refining a structural model.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the most logical choice.**\nBased on the analysis, the observation of a strong NOE signal forces the conclusion that the two protons are close in space (likely < 5.0 Å). This directly refutes the computational model's prediction of 7.0 Å. Thus, the model must be incorrect in that specific region and requires revision based on the experimental restraint. Option A is the only choice that accurately reflects this conclusion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2144733"}, {"introduction": "While simple one-to-one proton interactions are ideal, real NMR spectra are often complicated by signal overlap, or degeneracy, where multiple protons have the same chemical shift.

The intensity, $I$, of an NOE cross-peak between two protons is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance, $r$, between them, i.e., $I \\propto r^{-6}$.\n\nConsider a scenario where a specific proton, $H_A$, in a molecule is spatially close to two other distinct protons, $H_B$ and $H_C$. Due to some form of molecular symmetry or rapid dynamics, protons $H_B$ and $H_C$ are chemically degenerate, meaning they have identical chemical shifts and cannot be resolved in the NMR spectrum. Consequently, a single NOE cross-peak is observed between $H_A$ and the degenerate pair, and its measured intensity, $I_{obs}$, is the sum of the individual intensities from the $H_A-H_B$ and $H_A-H_C$ interactions.\n\nLet the true distance between $H_A$ and $H_B$ be $r_1$, and the true distance between $H_A$ and $H_C$ be $r_2$. In structural biology software, distance restraints derived from NOE data are often used. If an analyst naively treats the observed degenerate cross-peak as arising from an interaction with a single, \"effective\" proton, they would assign a single effective distance, $r_{eff}$, to this restraint. This effective distance is defined as the hypothetical distance that would, by itself, produce an NOE with the observed intensity $I_{obs}$.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the effective distance, $r_{eff}$, in terms of the actual distances $r_1$ and $r_2$.", "solution": "The problem requires us to find an expression for an \"effective\" distance, $r_{eff}$, that corresponds to the total observed intensity of an unresolved Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) cross-peak arising from two separate interactions.\n\nFirst, we begin with the fundamental principle given in the problem statement: the intensity $I$ of an NOE signal is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance $r$ between the interacting protons. We can express this relationship using a proportionality constant, $k$:\n$$I = \\frac{k}{r^6}$$\nThis constant $k$ depends on various experimental parameters and the correlation time of the molecule, but it is the same for all proton pairs within the same experiment.\n\nThe observed cross-peak arises from two distinct interactions: one between proton $H_A$ and proton $H_B$ over a distance $r_1$, and another between $H_A$ and $H_C$ over a distance $r_2$. Let's denote the individual intensities of these interactions as $I_1$ and $I_2$, respectively. Using our fundamental equation, we can write:\n$$I_1 = \\frac{k}{r_1^6}$$\n$$I_2 = \\frac{k}{r_2^6}$$\n\nAs stated in the problem, because protons $H_B$ and $H_C$ are degenerate, their signals overlap completely, and the total observed intensity, $I_{obs}$, is the sum of the individual intensities:\n$$I_{obs} = I_1 + I_2$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_1$ and $I_2$, we get:\n$$I_{obs} = \\frac{k}{r_1^6} + \\frac{k}{r_2^6} = k \\left( \\frac{1}{r_1^6} + \\frac{1}{r_2^6} \\right)$$\n\nThe problem defines the effective distance, $r_{eff}$, as the distance that would yield this total observed intensity $I_{obs}$ if it were from a single interaction. Therefore, we can also write $I_{obs}$ in terms of $r_{eff}$ using the same fundamental relationship:\n$$I_{obs} = \\frac{k}{r_{eff}^6}$$\n\nNow we have two expressions for $I_{obs}$. By equating them, we can solve for $r_{eff}$:\n$$\\frac{k}{r_{eff}^6} = k \\left( \\frac{1}{r_1^6} + \\frac{1}{r_2^6} \\right)$$\nThe proportionality constant $k$ is non-zero and appears on both sides of the equation, so it can be canceled out:\n$$\\frac{1}{r_{eff}^6} = \\frac{1}{r_1^6} + \\frac{1}{r_2^6}$$\n\nTo solve for $r_{eff}$, we first take the reciprocal of both sides of the equation:\n$$r_{eff}^6 = \\left( \\frac{1}{r_1^6} + \\frac{1}{r_2^6} \\right)^{-1}$$\nFinally, we take the sixth root of both sides to obtain the expression for $r_{eff}$:\n$$r_{eff} = \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{r_1^6} + \\frac{1}{r_2^6} \\right)^{-1} \\right]^{1/6}$$\nThis can be written more compactly using negative exponents.
