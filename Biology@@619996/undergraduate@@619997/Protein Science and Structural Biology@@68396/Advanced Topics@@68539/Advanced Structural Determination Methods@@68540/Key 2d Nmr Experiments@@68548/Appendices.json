A common two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiment is the Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY) experiment. The fundamental principle of COSY is to reveal which protons are coupled to each other through the chemical bonds connecting them.\n\nA student is analyzing the COSY spectrum of a small, folded protein. For a particular glycine residue within the protein, the two alpha-protons (attached to the $C_{\\alpha}$ carbon) are found to be chemically non-equivalent due to the chiral environment of the protein backbone. Let's label them $H_{\\alpha2}$ and $H_{\\alpha3}$. The student observes a distinct and strong cross-peak connecting the signals of $H_{\\alpha2}$ and $H_{\\alpha3}$ in the COSY spectrum.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct physical explanation for the presence of this specific cross-peak?\n\nA. The two alpha-protons, $H_{\\alpha2}$ and $H_{\\alpha3}$, are in close proximity in 3D space, which facilitates a strong through-space Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) between them.\n\nB. The $H_{\\alpha2}$ and $H_{\\alpha3}$ protons are geminal, meaning they are attached to the same carbon atom, and they exhibit through-bond scalar (J) coupling.\n\nC. The two protons are part of a rapid chemical exchange process, causing their magnetizations to interconvert on the timescale of the NMR experiment.\n\nD. The non-equivalence of $H_{\\alpha2}$ and $H_{\\alpha3}$ causes them to have identical resonance frequencies, leading to a strong signal on the diagonal that is misinterpreted as a cross-peak.\n\nE. The alpha-protons are strongly coupled to the adjacent amide proton ($H_N$) of the next residue in the peptide chain, which indirectly links $H_{\\alpha2}$ and $H_{\\alpha3}$.", "solution": "A COSY experiment correlates nuclei that are connected by through-bond scalar coupling. The mechanism is coherence transfer mediated by the scalar coupling Hamiltonian. For two spins labeled 1 and 2, the internal Hamiltonian can be written as\n$$\nH=-\\omega_{1} I_{1z}-\\omega_{2} I_{2z}+2\\pi J_{12}\\,\\mathbf{I}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{I}_{2}\\,,\n$$\nand in the weak-coupling limit the relevant scalar-coupling evolution is governed by\n$$\nH_{J}=2\\pi J_{12} I_{1z} I_{2z}\\,.\n$$\nUsing the product-operator formalism for a two-pulse COSY with nominal $90^{\\circ}$ pulses about the x-axis, the initial longitudinal magnetization $I_{1z}+I_{2z}$ is rotated to transverse terms $I_{1y}+I_{2y}$. During the evolution period $t_{1}$, each transverse operator evolves under $H_{J}$ as\n$$\nI_{1y}\\to I_{1y}\\cos\\!\\left(\\pi J_{12} t_{1}\\right)+2 I_{1x} I_{2z}\\sin\\!\\left(\\pi J_{12} t_{1}\\right),\\quad\nI_{2y}\\to I_{2y}\\cos\\!\\left(\\pi J_{12} t_{1}\\right)+2 I_{2x} I_{1z}\\sin\\!\\left(\\pi J_{12} t_{1}\\right).\n$$\nThe second $90^{\\circ}$ pulse about x converts the antiphase terms into terms that involve the partner spin’s transverse magnetization, for example\n$$\n2 I_{1x} I_{2z}\\xrightarrow{90_{x}} 2 I_{1x} I_{2y},\n$$\nwhich, during detection over $t_{2}$, precesses at the resonance frequency $\\omega_{2}$. This yields off-diagonal cross-peaks at coordinates $(\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2})$ and $(\\omega_{2},\\omega_{1})$ with intensity proportional to $\\sin\\!\\left(\\pi J_{12} t_{1}\\right)$, and therefore requires a nonzero scalar coupling $J_{12}\\neq 0$. Thus, a cross-peak in COSY specifically indicates through-bond scalar (J) coupling between the two spins.\n\nFor a glycine residue, the two alpha protons $H_{\\alpha2}$ and $H_{\\alpha3}$ are geminal (both attached to $C_{\\alpha}$) and, in a chiral environment, become diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent). They exhibit a two-bond scalar coupling $^{2}J_{HH}$ across the $C_{\\alpha}$ atom, which is typically nonzero. Therefore, a distinct and strong cross-peak between $H_{\\alpha2}$ and $H_{\\alpha3}$ in a COSY spectrum is correctly explained by their geminal through-bond scalar coupling.\n\nThe alternative options are inconsistent with the COSY mechanism: \n- Option A invokes through-space NOE, which generates cross-peaks in NOESY, not COSY, whose cross-peaks arise from scalar coupling, not cross-relaxation.\n- Option C pertains to chemical exchange (EXSY-type correlations), not the scalar-coupling mediated coherence transfer probed by COSY.\n- Option D contradicts the observation: non-equivalence implies different chemical shifts, and diagonal peaks are auto-correlations, not off-diagonal cross-peaks.\n- Option E suggests an indirect linkage via an adjacent amide proton; while each $H_{\\alpha}$ may couple to $H_N$, the strong geminal cross-peak between $H_{\\alpha2}$ and $H_{\\alpha3}$ in standard COSY is directly due to their mutual $^{2}J_{HH}$, not an indirect pathway typical of relayed experiments.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that $H_{\\alpha2}$ and $H_{\\alpha3}$ are geminal and exhibit through-bond scalar coupling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2116305"}, {"introduction": "While COSY reveals direct coupling neighbors, the TOCSY experiment expands this to show correlations between a proton and all other protons in its spin network.

TOCSY is more useful because it allows for the identification of the entire set of protons belonging to a single residue from one starting point (e.g., the alpha-proton), making it easier to group the side chain signals together for definitive identification.\n\nB. COSY is more useful because by only showing direct connections, it simplifies the spectrum and reduces signal overlap, which is the primary challenge in distinguishing the two similar residues.\n\nC. TOCSY is more useful because the leucine sidechain constitutes a single continuous spin system, whereas the isoleucine sidechain is broken into two distinct spin systems that a TOCSY experiment can differentiate.\n\nD. COSY is more useful because the through-space proximity of the methyl groups is different in the two residues, and COSY is uniquely sensitive to these spatial relationships.\n\nE. Both experiments would be equally useful, as they both rely on J-coupling and will show correlations for all protons in the side chain, just with different patterns.", "solution": "We interpret each residue’s side-chain protons, including the alpha-proton, as nodes in a graph $G=(V,E)$ where $V$ is the set of protons and an edge $(i,j)\\in E$ exists if and only if the two protons $i$ and $j$ are scalar coupled (nonzero $J_{ij}$) over two or three bonds. By the problem’s assumption, for both leucine and isoleucine, the entire set of side-chain protons starting from the alpha-proton forms a single connected component in $G$.\n\nPhysical principles:\n- COSY detects through-bond scalar couplings, giving cross-peaks for pairs $(i,j)$ with direct coupling, i.e., $(i,j)\\in E$ where $J_{ij}\\neq 0$ over two or three bonds.\n- TOCSY uses isotropic mixing to transfer magnetization across the entire coupled network. An effective mixing Hamiltonian can be written symbolically as\n$$\nH_{\\text{mix}} \\propto \\sum_{i<j} J_{ij}\\,\\mathbf{I}_{i}\\cdot \\mathbf{I}_{j},\n$$\nand during the mixing time magnetization can propagate along any path in the graph.

In graph terms, COSY reports the adjacency $(i,j)\\in E$, whereas TOCSY reports the transitive closure: all pairs of nodes in the same connected component.\n\nApplication to leucine versus isoleucine:\n- Leucine side chain: $-{\\rm CH}_{2}-{\\rm CH}({\\rm CH}_{3})_{2}$. There are two methyl groups attached to the same carbon (geminal methyls on the $\\gamma$-carbon), with the alpha-proton coupled stepwise through $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ positions to both methyl groups.\n- Isoleucine side chain: $-{\\rm CH}({\\rm CH}_{3})-{\\rm CH}_{2}-{\\rm CH}_{3}$. There are two methyl groups located at different positions (one on the $\\beta$-carbon, one terminal on the $\\delta$-carbon), again connected to the alpha-proton through a continuous chain of $J$ couplings.\n\nGiven the assumption that both residues’ side-chain protons form a single connected spin system, TOCSY will produce cross-peaks from the alpha-proton to all side-chain protons (including both methyl groups) in one experiment. This allows one to group all resonances belonging to a single residue unambiguously from a single starting peak (e.g., the alpha-proton). That grouping is precisely what facilitates distinguishing the branching patterns of leucine versus isoleucine despite chemical-shift overlap. In contrast, COSY only shows immediate neighbors in $E$; distinguishing the two residues would require stepwise tracing across multiple COSY cross-peaks, which is more susceptible to overlap and ambiguity. \n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is correct: TOCSY reveals the entire spin system from a single starting resonance, enabling clean grouping of all side-chain signals for a residue and facilitating differentiation.\n- B is not the most accurate: while COSY is simpler, the key challenge here is grouping all protons of a residue rather than merely reducing overlap; TOCSY addresses grouping more directly.\n- C is false given the stated assumption: both side chains are single, unbroken $J$-coupled networks, so TOCSY would not show two separate spin systems for isoleucine.\n- D is incorrect: through-space proximity is probed by NOESY/ROESY, not COSY; COSY is through-bond.\n- E is incorrect: COSY does not show correlations for all protons in the side chain; it shows only directly coupled pairs, whereas TOCSY shows correlations across the entire connected network.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate reasoning is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2116280"}, {"introduction": "Beyond mapping connections within a single residue, NMR excels at revealing the three-dimensional architecture of proteins, including interactions between distant parts of a chain or even separate protein subunits.

Due to the protein's symmetry, this single cross-peak could represent either an intra-subunit interaction (within a single monomer) or an inter-subunit interaction (across the dimer interface).\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity, an advanced isotope-labeling experiment is designed. Two batches of Dimerin are produced: one is uniformly enriched with $^{13}$C (all carbons are $^{13}$C), and the other is at natural isotopic abundance (predominantly $^{12}$C, hence 'unlabeled'). The dimers from both batches are then fully dissociated into their constituent monomers. These labeled and unlabeled monomers are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and then allowed to re-associate, forming a statistical mixture of labeled-labeled (LL), labeled-unlabeled (LU), and unlabeled-unlabeled (UU) dimers.\n\nA $^{13}$C F1-filtered/F2-filtered NOESY experiment is performed on this mixed sample. This specific type of experiment is designed to suppress signals from protons attached to $^{13}$C atoms.
