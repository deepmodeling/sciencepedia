{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in experimental phasing methods like MIR is to locate the heavy atoms added to the crystal. The difference Patterson map, which maps all interatomic vectors within the heavy-atom substructure, is the classic tool for this task. The clarity of this map, and thus the success of the entire experiment, critically depends on the heavy atoms binding to a small number of specific sites. This practice ([@problem_id:2119557]) challenges you to think through a common pitfall: what happens when the heavy atoms are distributed non-specifically across many sites?", "problem": "A team of structural biologists is attempting to determine the three-dimensional structure of a novel protein using the Multiple Isomorphous Replacement (MIR) method. They have successfully produced a native protein crystal and collected a high-resolution X-ray diffraction dataset. To solve the phase problem, they prepare a heavy-atom derivative by soaking a native crystal in a solution containing a platinum compound. After collecting a second diffraction dataset from this derivative crystal, they calculate a difference Patterson map, which uses Fourier coefficients of the form $(|F_{PH}| - |F_P|)^2$, where $|F_{PH}|$ and $|F_P|$ are the structure factor amplitudes for the heavy-atom derivative and native protein crystals, respectively.\n\nUpon further investigation using analytical techniques, the team discovers a complication: the platinum atoms did not bind to a small number of specific, high-occupancy sites as hoped. Instead, the heavy atoms have distributed themselves across a very large number, $N$, of non-specific binding sites on the protein surface, where $N$ is on the order of several hundred. Each of these sites has a very low and roughly equal fractional occupancy, $o$, where $o \\ll 1$. Despite the low occupancy at any individual site, the total amount of platinum incorporated into the crystal is significant.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the main features of the calculated difference Patterson map and the resulting implications for solving the protein structure using MIR?\n\nA. The map will be dominated by a single, very strong peak at the origin, while the rest of the map will show a generally noisy and featureless background. Consequently, determining the heavy atom positions will be impossible, and the MIR phasing attempt will fail.\n\nB. The map will exhibit a large number of weak but clearly resolved non-origin peaks, corresponding to the vectors between the many low-occupancy sites. Solving this complex heavy-atom substructure will be computationally challenging but ultimately feasible with modern software.\n\nC. Because the occupancy at each site is very low, the heavy-atom contribution is negligible. The structure factor amplitudes of the derivative and native crystals will be nearly identical ($|F_{PH}| \\approx |F_P|$), resulting in a difference Patterson map that contains only random noise with no significant peaks, including at the origin.\n\nD. The numerous, widely-distributed heavy atoms will effectively act as a random noise source. The resulting difference Patterson map will be indistinguishable from a Patterson map calculated from the native protein data alone, providing no useful information for phasing.\n\nE. The map will show a single, sharp non-origin peak corresponding to the average vector between all platinum sites. This single vector will be sufficient to determine a single phase and subsequently solve the entire structure through density modification.", "solution": "Let the derivative structure factor be written as a sum of protein and heavy-atom contributions,\n$$\nF_{PH}(\\mathbf{h})=F_{P}(\\mathbf{h})+F_{H}(\\mathbf{h}),\n$$\nwhere for a heavy-atom substructure consisting of sites at positions $\\mathbf{r}_{i}$ with equal fractional occupancy $o$ and atomic scattering factor $f_{H}(\\mathbf{h})$, one has\n$$\nF_{H}(\\mathbf{h})=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} o\\,f_{H}(\\mathbf{h})\\exp\\!\\left(2\\pi i\\,\\mathbf{h}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{i}\\right).\n$$\nThe difference Patterson map is computed with Fourier coefficients\n$$\nD(\\mathbf{h})^{2}=\\left(|F_{PH}(\\mathbf{h})|-|F_{P}(\\mathbf{h})|\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nFor isomorphous derivatives where the heavy-atom contribution is superimposed on the native, the standard approximation used in MIR is that, upon averaging over many reflections with essentially random protein phases, the difference-Patterson with coefficients $D(\\mathbf{h})^{2}$ approximates the Patterson of the heavy-atom substructure:\n$$\nP_{\\text{diff}}(\\mathbf{u})\\approx \\sum_{\\mathbf{h}} |F_{H}(\\mathbf{h})|^{2}\\exp\\!\\left(-2\\pi i\\,\\mathbf{h}\\cdot \\mathbf{u}\\right).\n$$\nThe Patterson of a set of point scatterers is a sum over all interatomic vectors with weights equal to products of their scattering powers. Writing the effective weight per heavy-atom site as $w=o\\,f_{H}$, one obtains\n$$\nP_{\\text{diff}}(\\mathbf{u})\\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} w^{2}\\,\\delta\\!\\left(\\mathbf{u}-(\\mathbf{r}_{i}-\\mathbf{r}_{j})\\right).\n$$\nThis immediately gives two key features.\n\n1) The origin peak arises from the self-vectors $i=j$, with total weight\n$$\nP_{\\text{origin}}\\propto \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w^{2}=N\\,o^{2}\\,f_{H}^{2}.\n$$\nSince $N$ is large, this peak scales linearly with $N$ and is therefore very strong.\n\n2) Non-origin peaks arise from $i\\neq j$ pairs, each with weight $w^{2}=o^{2}f_{H}^{2}$. There are $N(N-1)$ such vectors, but for a large number of non-specific, widely distributed sites, these vectors are broadly and quasi-randomly distributed throughout $\\mathbf{u}$-space. Because finite resolution broadens Patterson peaks, the many weak contributions overlap and superpose incoherently over many distinct grid points. The typical local amplitude at a non-origin position does not scale as $N$; instead, it reflects a dense superposition of many small contributions, yielding a generally elevated but noisy and nearly featureless background. Crucially, individual non-origin peaks corresponding to specific inter-site vectors are not clearly resolvable.\n\nTherefore, the dominant feature of the difference Patterson is a very strong origin peak proportional to $N o^{2} f_{H}^{2}$, while the rest of the map lacks discrete, interpretable non-origin peaks due to the random, low-occupancy, high-multiplicity distribution of sites. Without resolvable non-origin peaks, determining heavy-atom positions is effectively impossible, and an MIR phasing attempt cannot proceed.\n\nThis behavior is inconsistent with the claim that the heavy-atom effect is negligible (the strong origin contradicts that), inconsistent with a map indistinguishable from a native Patterson, and inconsistent with a single sharp non-origin peak or a set of many clearly resolved non-origin peaks. It matches the prediction that the map is dominated by a strong origin with a noisy background and that MIR will fail to yield a usable heavy-atom substructure.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2119557"}, {"introduction": "Once initial heavy-atom positions are found, the model must be refined for accuracy.

The second derivative (PH2) is prepared similarly using a platinum compound.

The effective number of electrons is defined as the product of the heavy atom's atomic number ($Z$) and its fractional site occupancy ($q$). For the purposes of this problem, you may ignore the effects of atomic temperature factors (B-factors).\n\nExperimental analysis of the resulting maps yields the following data:\n- In the map for the mercury derivative (PH1), the peak corresponding to the Hg atom has a height of $H_1 = 55.4$ e/Å³.

The primary difference between the two solutions is the placement of the molecule within the unit cell, resulting in distinct crystal packing arrangements.\n\nTo break the ambiguity, an initial, brief round of rigid-body refinement is performed independently for both solutions against the experimental diffraction data. A randomly selected subset of 5% of the total reflections was set aside as a \"free\" set, which was not used during the refinement calculations.
