This pair matches Ala ($C_{\\beta}=19.0$, $C_{\\alpha}=52.5$). Therefore, in strip X, $i-1=$ Ala, so strip X is residue $i=2$ (the residue immediately following the N-terminal Ala).\n- Strip Y (CBCA(CO)NH): peaks at $40.5$ and $54.0$ ppm. This pair matches Asp ($C_{\\beta}=40.5$, $C_{\\alpha}=54.0$). Therefore, in strip Y, $i-1=$ Asp, so strip Y is residue $i=3$, and residue $2$ must be Asp.\n\nThus, from CBCA(CO)NH alone, the sequence must be Ala-Asp-? and the residue at position $3$ must be Asn.\n\nVerify and complete with HNCACB:\n- Strip X (HNCACB): peaks at $19.0$, $40.5$, $52.5$, $54.0$ ppm. The pair {$19.0,52.5$} are $i-1=$ Ala, leaving {$40.5,54.0$} for residue $i$; these match Asp ($C_{\\beta}=40.5$, $C_{\\alpha}=54.0$).

In the spectral plane corresponding to the $H_N$/$^{15}\\text{N}$ of Residue X, a sequential $C_{\\alpha}$ cross-peak is observed near 54.15 ppm. However, due to the near-degeneracy of the $C_{\\alpha}$ shifts for Candidate A and Candidate B, it is impossible to distinguish between them. Furthermore, the sequential $C_{\\beta}$ cross-peak in the HNCACB spectrum is missing or too weak to be interpreted, preventing resolution of the ambiguity.\n\nTo resolve this, a 3D HNCO experiment, which correlates the amide of residue $i$ with the carbonyl carbon of the preceding residue ($i-1$), is performed.

The sequential $C_{\\beta}$ cross-peak is missing or too weak in HNCACB, so these experiments alone cannot distinguish the two candidates.\n\nNext, interpret the HNCO result.

We must first identify which spin system corresponds to Glycine and which to Aspartic Acid, and then establish their connectivity.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the NMR Experiments**\n*   **3D HNCA:** This experiment correlates the amide proton ($H_N$) and nitrogen ($^{15}\\text{N}$) of a given amino acid residue (residue $i$) to two alpha-carbons ($C_{\\alpha}$): its own $C_{\\alpha}(i)$ (this is called the intra-residue correlation) and the $C_{\\alpha}$ of the preceding residue, $C_{\\alpha}(i-1)$ (the inter-residue correlation).\n*   **3D HNCO:** This experiment correlates the amide ($H_N$, $^{15}\\text{N}$) of residue $i$ to the carbonyl carbon ($C'$) of the preceding residue, $C'(i-1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Residues using HNCA Data**\nWe analyze the HNCA data for each spin system to identify the residue type. The intra-residue $C_{\\alpha}$ correlation will have a chemical shift characteristic of that amino acid.\n\n*   **Spin System 1 (Amide at 8.7, 119 ppm):** The HNCA data for this system shows correlations to two $C_{\\alpha}$ nuclei at 54.8 ppm and 50.5 ppm. We compare these to the reference values. The value 54.8 ppm is the characteristic $C_{\\alpha}$ shift for Aspartic Acid. Therefore, this must be the intra-residue peak. This allows us to identify **Spin System 1 as Aspartic Acid (Asp)**. The other peak at 50.5 ppm corresponds to the $C_{\\alpha}$ of the residue preceding this Asp.\n\n*   **Spin System 2 (Amide at 8.1, 109 ppm):** The HNCA data for this system shows correlations to $C_{\\alpha}$ nuclei at 45.2 ppm and 54.8 ppm. The reference value of 45.2 ppm is characteristic of Glycine. This must be the intra-residue peak. This allows us to identify **Spin System 2 as Glycine (Gly)**. The other peak at 54.8 ppm corresponds to the $C_{\\alpha}$ of the residue preceding this Gly.\n\nSo far, we have established: Spin System 1 = Asp and Spin System 2 = Gly.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Sequence using HNCA Connectivity**\nNow we establish the sequential order of the two residues. The principle of sequential assignment (or \"walking\") via HNCA relies on finding a shared $C_{\\alpha}$ frequency between the HNCA spectra of two adjacent residues. Specifically, the inter-residue $C_{\\alpha}(i-1)$ peak for residue $i$ must match the frequency of the intra-residue $C_{\\alpha}(i-1)$ peak for residue $i-1$.\n\n*   Let's analyze the inter-residue correlation for Spin System 2 (Gly). The data shows it has an inter-residue peak at 54.8 ppm. This means the residue preceding Gly has a $C_{\\alpha}$ chemical shift of 54.8 ppm.\n*   From Step 2, we identified that Spin System 1 (Asp) has an intra-residue $C_{\\alpha}$ chemical shift of 54.8 ppm.\n*   The connection is clear: The amide of Spin System 2 (Gly) \"sees\" the $C_{\\alpha}$ of Spin System 1 (Asp) as its preceding neighbor.\n*   Therefore, Spin System 1 (Asp) must immediately precede Spin System 2 (Gly) in the protein sequence.\n*   The dipeptide sequence is **Asp-Gly**.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the Sequence using HNCO Data**\nThe HNCO data provides an independent confirmation of the sequence.\n\n*   The problem states that for the amide of Spin System 2 (Gly), an HNCO peak is observed at a $C'$ chemical shift of 177.1 ppm.\n*   The HNCO experiment links the amide of residue $i$ (in this case, Gly) to the carbonyl carbon of the preceding residue, $C'(i-1)$.\n*   Thus, the residue preceding Gly must have a $C'$ shift of 177.1 ppm.\n*   Consulting the reference data, the characteristic $C'$ shift for Asp is ~177.1 ppm.\n*   This confirms that an Aspartic Acid residue precedes the Glycine residue, corroborating the Asp-Gly sequence determined from the HNCA data.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nCombining all the evidence:\n1.  Spin System 1 is Aspartic Acid.\n2.  Spin System 2 is Glycine.\n3.
