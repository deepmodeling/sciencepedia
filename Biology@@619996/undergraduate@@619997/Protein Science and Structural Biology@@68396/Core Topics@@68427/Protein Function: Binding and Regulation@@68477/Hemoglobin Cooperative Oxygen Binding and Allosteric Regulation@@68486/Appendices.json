This exercise presents a thought experiment to solidify your understanding of this fundamental principle. By considering a hypothetical hemoglobin mutant that is permanently locked in the $R$-state, you can explore the direct consequences of eliminating the $T-R$ transition on the protein's oxygen-binding curve and its cooperativity [@problem_id:2113011].", "problem": "Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. It is a tetramer composed of four subunits, each capable of binding one oxygen molecule. The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is cooperative, a phenomenon described by the protein's ability to switch between a low-affinity \"Tense\" (T) state and a high-affinity \"Relaxed\" (R) state. In the T-state, hemoglobin has a low affinity for oxygen, whereas in the R-state, its affinity is significantly higher. The transition from T to R is promoted by oxygen binding, meaning that when one subunit binds oxygen, it becomes more likely that the other subunits will also bind oxygen. This cooperative behavior results in a characteristic sigmoidal oxygen-binding curve.\n\nThe degree of cooperativity is quantified by the Hill coefficient, $n_H$. A value of $n_H > 1$ indicates positive cooperativity, $n_H = 1$ indicates non-cooperative binding, and $n_H  1$ indicates negative cooperativity. For normal human hemoglobin, the Hill coefficient is typically around 2.8.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutant form of hemoglobin that is unable to transition into the T-state. This mutant protein is permanently \"stuck\" in the high-affinity R-state, regardless of whether oxygen is bound. Which of the following best describes the oxygen-binding curve and the approximate Hill coefficient ($n_H$) for this mutant hemoglobin?\n\nA. Sigmoidal curve with a Hill coefficient ($n_H$) of approximately 2.8.\n\nB. Hyperbolic curve with a Hill coefficient ($n_H$) of approximately 1.0.\n\nC.

Left-shifted sigmoidal curve with a Hill coefficient ($n_H$) greater than 3.0.", "solution": "Cooperative oxygen binding in hemoglobin arises from a ligand-linked equilibrium between two conformations, the low-affinity T state and the high-affinity R state. In the Monod-Wyman-Changeux framework, cooperativity requires the possibility of a T to R transition that is stabilized by ligand binding. The Hill coefficient $n_{H}$ quantifies the effective cooperativity; for normal human hemoglobin, $n_{H}\\approx 2.8$, reflecting positive cooperativity from the T to R transition.\n\nFor the mutant hemoglobin that is permanently in the R state, there is no T to R equilibrium to modulate affinity as ligand binds. Consequently, the binding sites behave as independent and identical high-affinity sites without cooperativity. For independent binding, the fractional saturation $Y$ as a function of ligand activity (or partial pressure) $p$ has the hyperbolic form\n$$\nY=\\frac{p}{P_{50}+p},\n$$\nwhere $P_{50}$ is the ligand partial pressure at half-saturation. The Hill plot $\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{Y}{1-Y}\\right)$ versus $\\ln p$ has slope equal to the Hill coefficient $n_{H}$, and for non-cooperative binding this slope is $n_{H}=1$.\n\nTherefore:\n- The curve is hyperbolic (not sigmoidal), reflecting non-cooperative binding.\n- The effective Hill coefficient is approximately $1.0$.\n- Relative to normal hemoglobin, the high-affinity R-state would be left-shifted, but the dominant distinguishing feature here is the loss of sigmoidal shape and $n_{H}=1$.\n\nAmong the options, only B correctly states a hyperbolic curve with $n_{H}\\approx 1.0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2113011"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its intrinsic cooperativity, hemoglobin's function is finely tuned by its environment through allosteric regulation. This practice focuses on the Bohr effect, a critical physiological mechanism where blood pH modulates hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen.

The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is cooperative, resulting in a characteristic sigmoidal (S-shaped) oxygen-dissociation curve when plotting the percent saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen against the partial pressure of oxygen ($p\\text{O}_2$).

Hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases, causing the oxygen-dissociation curve to shift to the left and leading to reduced oxygen release in the tissues.\n\nC.

A leftward shift of the oxygen-dissociation curve corresponds to a decrease in $P_{50}$ (higher affinity), whereas a rightward shift corresponds to an increase in $P_{50}$ (lower affinity).\n\nBy the Bohr effect, an increase in $\\text{H}^{+}$ concentration (lower pH) decreases oxygen affinity (right shift, larger $P_{50}$), and a decrease in $\\text{H}^{+}$ concentration (higher pH) increases oxygen affinity (left shift, smaller $P_{50}$). Symbolically:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P_{50}}{\\partial \\text{pH}}  0.\n$$\nTherefore, when pH increases from $7.4$ to $7.6$, $P_{50}$ decreases, shifting the curve to the left and increasing hemoglobinâ€™s affinity for oxygen.\n\nTo assess oxygen delivery, compare saturation in lungs and tissues. Let $p\\text{O}_{2,\\text{L}}$ and $p\\text{O}_{2,\\text{T}}$ denote the partial pressures in lungs and tissues, respectively, with corresponding saturations $Y_{\\text{L}}$ and $Y_{\\text{T}}$.

In the lungs ($pO_2 = 100$ torr), myoglobin is significantly less saturated with oxygen than hemoglobin.**\nOur calculations show $Y_{Mb, lungs} \\approx 0.973$ and $Y_{Hb, lungs} \\approx 0.974$. These values are nearly identical. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**B. Hemoglobin's higher $p_{50}$ value indicates that it binds oxygen more tightly than myoglobin at all partial pressures.**\nThe $p_{50}$ value is the partial pressure required to achieve 50% saturation. A *lower* $p_{50}$ indicates a *higher* affinity for the ligand (oxygen). Since $p_{50,Mb} (2.8 \\text{ torr})  p_{50,Hb} (26 \\text{ torr})$, myoglobin has a much higher affinity for oxygen than hemoglobin. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**C. The total amount of oxygen released by myoglobin as $pO_2$ drops from 100 torr to 20 torr is greater than the amount released by hemoglobin.**\nThe amount of oxygen released is proportional to the change in fractional saturation ($\\Delta Y = Y_{lungs} - Y_{muscle}$).\nFor myoglobin: $\\Delta Y_{Mb} = Y_{Mb, lungs} - Y_{Mb, muscle} \\approx 0.9728 - 0.8772 = 0.0956$.\nFor hemoglobin: $\\Delta Y_{Hb} = Y_{Hb, lungs} - Y_{Hb, muscle} \\approx 0.9741 - 0.2944 = 0.6797$.\nHemoglobin releases a much larger fraction of its bound oxygen ($\\approx 68\\%$) than myoglobin ($\\approx 10\\%$) over this range of partial pressures. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**D. In muscle tissue ($pO_2 = 20$ torr), myoglobin has a much higher fractional saturation than hemoglobin, which creates a pressure gradient that facilitates the transfer of oxygen from the blood to the muscle cells.**\nOur calculations show $Y_{Mb, muscle} \\approx 0.877$ and $Y_{Hb, muscle} \\approx 0.294$. Myoglobin's saturation is indeed much higher. This high affinity (low $p_{50}$) of myoglobin ensures that it can effectively bind the oxygen released by the lower-affinity hemoglobin in the blood. This difference in affinity drives the net movement of oxygen from blood (hemoglobin) to muscle tissue (myoglobin). This statement accurately describes the physiological function and is supported by our calculations. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n**E. At the $p_{50}$ of hemoglobin ($pO_2 = 26$ torr), myoglobin is also approximately 50% saturated.**\nAt $pO_2 = 26$ torr, hemoglobin is by definition 50% saturated. Let's calculate myoglobin's saturation at this pressure:\n$$Y_{Mb (at\\;26\\;torr)} = \\frac{26}{2.8 + 26} = \\frac{26}{28.8} \\approx 0.9028$$\nAt 26 torr, myoglobin is over 90% saturated, not 50%. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nConclusion: Statement D is the only one that is factually correct and that accurately describes the functional interplay between hemoglobin and myoglobin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2113020"}]}
