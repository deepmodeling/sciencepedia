This practice problem uses a hypothetical clinical scenario to explore the crucial role of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) as a negative allosteric effector. By considering the physiological consequences of its absence, you can reinforce your understanding of why finely-tuned allosteric regulation is essential for efficient oxygen delivery from the lungs to the tissues [@problem_id:2141689].", "problem": "Hemoglobin (Hb) is the protein in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the peripheral tissues. The binding and release of oxygen by hemoglobin are allosterically regulated by several factors, which ensures efficient oxygen delivery. One of the most important allosteric regulators is 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG), a small molecule present in high concentrations within red blood cells. BPG binds to the deoxygenated form of hemoglobin, stabilizing it and thereby decreasing hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. This effect is crucial for releasing oxygen in the tissues where it is needed.\n\nImagine a hypothetical clinical case where a patient is diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder that completely eliminates the production of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) in their red blood cells. Assume that the structure of the hemoglobin protein itself, its concentration, the red blood cell count, and all other physiological systems are otherwise normal.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately describes the primary physiological consequence for this patient?\n\nA. Impaired oxygen delivery to tissues, leading to symptoms of hypoxia, despite normal oxygen uptake in the lungs.\n\nB. Enhanced oxygen unloading in peripheral tissues, leading to an unusually high level of tissue oxygenation.\n\nC. A significant reduction in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, as hemoglobin would be unable to bind oxygen effectively in the lungs.\n\nD. A complete loss of the Bohr effect, meaning that changes in blood pH and carbon dioxide levels would no longer influence hemoglobin's oxygen affinity.\n\nE. The red blood cells would become fragile and lyse easily, leading to hemolytic anemia.", "solution": "BPG is a negative allosteric effector that binds deoxyhemoglobin, stabilizes the T state, and thereby decreases oxygen affinity. Removing BPG shifts the T-R equilibrium toward the R state and increases oxygen affinity. In terms of the oxygen dissociation curve, this is a left shift, which can be represented by a decrease in $P_{50}$.\n\nUsing the Hill equation for saturation as a function of partial pressure,\n$$\nS(P_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}})=\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}}{P_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}+P_{50}^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}},\n$$\neliminating BPG lowers $P_{50}$ to $P_{50}^{\\ast}$ with $P_{50}^{\\ast}  P_{50}$, increasing $S$ at any given $P_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}$. In the lungs (high $P_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}$), $S$ is already close to $1$, so oxygen loading is normal or slightly increased. In peripheral tissues (lower $P_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}$), the left shift reduces the drop in saturation from arterial to venous blood, thus reducing oxygen unloading.\n\nOxygen delivery to tissues depends on the arteriovenous content difference:\n$$\n\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}=Q\\left(C_{a\\mathrm{O_{2}}}-C_{v\\mathrm{O_{2}}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}$ depends on $[\\mathrm{Hb}]$ and $S$.

The primary physiological consequence is impaired tissue oxygen delivery with normal pulmonary oxygen uptake.\n\nExcluding alternatives:\n- Enhanced unloading (option B) is the opposite of the left shift outcome.\n- Oxygen-carrying capacity (option C) depends primarily on $[\\mathrm{Hb}]$ and binding sites; it is not reduced by increased affinity.\n- The Bohr effect (option D), driven by $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ interactions, persists without BPG.\n- Red cell fragility and hemolysis (option E) are not primary consequences of BPG absence.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is impaired oxygen delivery to tissues with normal lung uptake.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2141689"}, {"introduction": "The Bohr effect, which links blood pH to hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, is a classic example of allosteric regulation rooted in fundamental chemical principles.

This advanced problem challenges you to think like a protein designer, applying your knowledge of hemoglobin's structure, dynamics, and electrostatic principles. Your task is to devise a set of mutations that rationally inverts the function of BPG, turning it from a negative to a positive regulator of oxygen binding, thereby demonstrating a deep, integrated understanding of allosteric control [@problem_id:2141731].", "problem": "In a bioengineering project, researchers aim to develop a novel variant of human hemoglobin (Hb) that exhibits an inverted response to the allosteric effector 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG). Normally, BPG, a highly anionic molecule carrying a charge of approximately -5 at physiological pH, binds preferentially to the deoxygenated T-state of hemoglobin, stabilizing it and thus decreasing oxygen affinity. The goal is to design a mutant hemoglobin where BPG preferentially binds to and stabilizes the oxygenated R-state, effectively transforming BPG from a negative to a positive allosteric regulator of oxygen binding.\n\nYou are provided with the following structural information about the interface between the two beta-subunits (β1 and β2), where the BPG binding pocket is located:\n\n1.  In the T-state, the BPG binding pocket is a relatively wide central cavity lined by a cluster of positively charged amino acid side chains from both β-subunits. Key residues contributing to this cationic pocket are His2(β), Lys82(β), and His143(β).\n2.  Upon transition from the T-state to the R-state, the β-subunits slide and rotate relative to each other. This conformational change narrows the central cavity and increases the distance between the His143(β) side chains on opposite subunits, disrupting the geometry of the binding pocket and leading to the expulsion of BPG.\n3.  The residue Asp94(β) resides on the FG corner of the beta-subunit, with its side chain oriented towards the central cavity. Structural analysis reveals that in the T-state, the distance between the alpha-carbon atoms of Asp94 on the β1 subunit and Asp94 on the β2 subunit is approximately 14 Å. In the R-state, this distance decreases to approximately 10 Å.\n\nConsidering this information, which of the following minimal sets of site-directed mutations applied to both beta-subunits is most likely to achieve the desired inversion of BPG function, causing BPG to act as a stabilizer of the R-state?\n\nA. `Lys82(β) -> Glu`, `His143(β) -> Asp`, `Asp94(β) -> Lys`\nB. `His2(β) -> Asp`, `Lys82(β) -> Glu`, `His143(β) -> Glu`\nC. `His146(β) -> Lys`, `Asp94(β) -> Glu`\nD. `Asp94(β) -> Lys`\nE. `His2(β) -> Ala`, `Lys82(β) -> Ala`, `Asp94(β) -> Arg`, `His143(β) -> Ala`", "solution": "The objective is to re-engineer hemoglobin such that 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG), a strongly negative molecule, preferentially binds to the R-state instead of the T-state. This requires a two-part strategy: (1) eliminate the natural high-affinity binding site for BPG in the T-state, and (2) introduce a new, high-affinity binding site that is specific to the R-state conformation.\n\n**Part 1: Eliminating the T-state Binding Site**\n\nThe problem states that the T-state binding site for BPG is a cationic pocket formed by positively charged residues His2(β), Lys82(β), and His143(β). To eliminate binding at this site, we must remove these positive charges. A simple way is to mutate them to neutral residues (e.g., Alanine). However, a more effective strategy to prevent the binding of the highly anionic BPG (-5 charge) is to introduce electrostatic repulsion by mutating these key residues to negatively charged amino acids, such as Glutamate (Glu) or Aspartate (Asp). This will actively repel BPG from its canonical binding site in the T-state conformation.\n\n**Part 2: Engineering an R-state Specific Binding Site**\n\nWe need to create a new cationic pocket that is geometrically favorable for BPG binding only in the R-state. The problem provides a crucial clue about the residue Asp94(β). The distance between the alpha-carbons of the two Asp94(β) residues on opposite chains changes from a wide ~14 Å in the T-state to a narrower ~10 Å in the R-state.\n\nBy mutating the negatively charged Aspartate at position 94 to a positively charged residue like Lysine (Lys) or Arginine (Arg), we introduce new positive charges into the central cavity.\n- In the T-state, these two new positive charges would be ~14 Å apart. This distance is too large to allow for strong, cooperative electrostatic interaction with a single, relatively small BPG molecule.\n- In the R-state, these positive charges move to ~10 Å apart. This closer proximity creates a geometrically ideal cationic \"clamp\" that can effectively chelate the multiple phosphate groups of BPG. The long, flexible side chain of Lysine is particularly well-suited for this role.\n\nTherefore, the mutation `Asp94(β) -> Lys` (or Arg) creates a BPG binding site that is preferentially formed in the R-state.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A. `Lys82(β) -> Glu`, `His143(β) -> Asp`, `Asp94(β) -> Lys`**: This option perfectly implements the two-part strategy. The `K82E` and `H143D` mutations introduce strong electrostatic repulsion, destroying the native T-state binding site. The `D94K` mutation simultaneously creates a new binding site that is only geometrically viable in the R-state due to the closer proximity of the\n    two engineered Lysine residues. This is the most rational and complete design to invert BPG function.\n\n*   **B. `His2(β) -> Asp`, `Lys82(β) -> Glu`, `His143(β) -> Glu`**: This set of mutations successfully destroys the T-state binding site by introducing negative charges. However, it fails to create any new binding site for the R-state. The result would be a hemoglobin variant that does not bind BPG in either state, thus losing all BPG-mediated allosteric regulation, not inverting it.\n\n*   **C. `His146(β) -> Lys`, `Asp94(β) -> Glu`**: This is incorrect. His146(β) is primarily involved in the Bohr effect (proton binding), not the main BPG binding site. The mutation `D94E` would make the central cavity even more negative, further repelling BPG in both states.\n\n*   **D. `Asp94(β) -> Lys`**: This option is incomplete. It correctly introduces a potential R-state specific binding site. However, it leaves the original, high-affinity T-state binding site (composed of His2, Lys82, and His143) intact. Since the T-state site is very effective, BPG would likely still bind preferentially to the T-state, or perhaps bind to both states with similar affinity. This would not result in a clear *inversion* of function where the R-state is preferentially stabilized. The effect of the T-state stabilization would likely overwhelm the weaker, newly introduced R-state stabilization.\n\n*   **E. `His2(β) -> Ala`, `Lys82(β) -> Ala`, `Asp94(β) -> Arg`, `His143(β) -> Ala`**: This option is a plausible alternative to A. It uses neutral Alanine substitutions to abolish the T-site and a long-chain Arginine to create the R-site. While this would likely also work, option A is arguably superior because the Glu/Asp mutations provide active electrostatic repulsion against BPG in the T-site, rather than just removing the attraction. This creates a stronger energetic preference for the R-state binding. Between A and E, A represents a more robust engineering strategy. However, the question asks for the \"most likely\" set, and A's use of charge repulsion is a stronger method for abolishing the T-site binding than simple neutralization. Therefore, A remains the best choice.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, option A is the only choice that combines both necessary steps—destruction of the old site and creation of a new, conformation-specific site—in a rational and effective manner.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2141731"}]}
