The entropy change $\\Delta S_{H}$ could be unfavorable or weakly favorable, but the key mechanistic inference is that binding is enthalpically driven, consistent with formation of specific polar or electrostatic contacts (e.g., hydrogen bonds, van der Waals packing, salt bridges), often accompanied by an entropy penalty from loss of conformational freedom or ordering of desolvation layers.\n\n- Inhibitor-S has $\\Delta H_{S} = +5.0\\ \\text{kJ/mol}$ (endothermic). With the same $\\Delta G^{\\circ}  0$, the relation $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = \\Delta H_{S} - T \\Delta S_{S}  0$ with $\\Delta H_{S} > 0$ requires that $T \\Delta S_{S} > \\Delta H_{S} \\Longrightarrow \\Delta S_{S} > 0$, i.e., binding must be entropy driven.
