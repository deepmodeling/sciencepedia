The final total concentration of ChromoRead in the solution is 5.0 µM, and the final total concentration of Toxiphen is 8.0 µM. Through separate kinetic measurements, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) for the ChromoRead-Toxiphen complex has been determined to be 2.0 µM. Assuming the system has reached equilibrium, calculate the concentration of the ChromoRead-Toxiphen complex.\n\nExpress your answer in units of µM, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let P represent the protein ChromoRead, L represent the ligand Toxiphen, and PL represent the protein-ligand complex. The binding reaction at equilibrium is:\n$$P + L \\rightleftharpoons PL$$\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the equilibrium concentrations of the free protein, $[P]$, free ligand, $[L]$, and the protein-ligand complex, $[PL]$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[P][L]}{[PL]}$$\n\nWe are given the total concentrations of the protein, $[P]_{total}$, and the ligand, $[L]_{total}$. These are related to the free and bound concentrations by the mass balance equations:\n$$[P]_{total} = [P] + [PL]$$\n$$[L]_{total} = [L] + [PL]$$\n\nWe can express the free concentrations, $[P]$ and $[L]$, in terms of the total concentrations and the complex concentration, $[PL]$:\n$$[P] = [P]_{total} - [PL]$$\n$$[L] = [L]_{total} - [PL]$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $[P]$ and $[L]$ into the equation for the dissociation constant:\n$$K_d = \\frac{([P]_{total} - [PL])([L]_{total} - [PL])}{[PL]}$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for $[PL]$. First, multiply both sides by $[PL]$:\n$$K_d [PL] = ([P]_{total} - [PL])([L]_{total} - [PL])$$\n\nExpand the right side of the equation:\n$$K_d [PL] = [P]_{total}[L]_{total} - [P]_{total}[PL] - [L]_{total}[PL] + [PL]^2$$\n\nRearrange this into the standard form of a quadratic equation, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $x = [PL]$:\n$$[PL]^2 - ([P]_{total} + [L]_{total} + K_d)[PL] + [P]_{total}[L]_{total} = 0$$\n\nWe can solve for $[PL]$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$[PL] = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nHere, $a=1$, $b = -([P]_{total} + [L]_{total} + K_d)$, and $c = [P]_{total}[L]_{total}$.\nSubstituting these into the quadratic formula:\n$$[PL] = \\frac{([P]_{total} + [L]_{total} + K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{([P]_{total} + [L]_{total} + K_d)^2 - 4[P]_{total}[L]_{total}}}{2}$$\n\nWe must choose the physically correct root. The concentration of the complex, $[PL]$, cannot be greater than the total concentration of either the protein or the ligand. The sum $([P]_{total} + [L]_{total} + K_d)$ is larger than both $[P]_{total}$ and $[L]_{total}$. Choosing the positive sign in the numerator would result in a value for $[PL]$ that is larger than $([P]_{total} + [L]_{total} + K_d)/2$, which would be non-physical as it would exceed the initial concentrations of the reactants. Therefore, we must choose the negative sign.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$[P]_{total} = 5.0$ µM\n$[L]_{total} = 8.0$ µM\n$K_d = 2.0$ µM\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the solution:\nThe sum in the numerator is $[P]_{total} + [L]_{total} + K_d = 5.0 + 8.0 + 2.0 = 15.0$ µM.\nThe product for the term $c$ is $[P]_{total}[L]_{total} = (5.0)(8.0) = 40.0$ (µM)$^2$.\n\nSubstitute these into our chosen solution for $[PL]$:\n$$[PL] = \\frac{15.0 - \\sqrt{(15.0)^2 - 4(1)(40.0)}}{2}$$\n$$[PL] = \\frac{15.0 - \\sqrt{225 - 160}}{2}$$\n$$[PL] = \\frac{15.0 - \\sqrt{65}}{2}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{65} \\approx 8.062257...$$\n$$[PL] = \\frac{15.0 - 8.062257...}{2}$$\n$$[PL] = \\frac{6.937742...}{2}$$\n$$[PL] \\approx 3.468871... \\text{ µM}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$[PL] \\approx 3.47 \\text{ µM}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.47}$$", "id": "2128859"}, {"introduction": "While some proteins simply bind, enzymes catalyze reactions, and their behavior is described by the Michaelis-Menten model.
