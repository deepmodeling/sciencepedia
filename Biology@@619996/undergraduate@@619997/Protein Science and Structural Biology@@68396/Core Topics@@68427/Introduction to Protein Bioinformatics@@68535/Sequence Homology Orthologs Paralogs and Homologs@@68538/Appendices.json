This first exercise challenges you to be precise by examining a common biological process: alternative splicing. By determining why protein isoforms are not classified as paralogs, you will reinforce the critical distinction that paralogy arises specifically from gene duplication events, not from post-transcriptional processing [@problem_id:2136510].", "problem": "In evolutionary biology and bioinformatics, the relationships between proteins are categorized based on their evolutionary origin. The fundamental definitions are as follows:\n- **Homologs**: A general term for proteins related by descent from a common ancestor.\n- **Orthologs**: Homologs found in different species that arose from a single ancestral gene during a speciation event. They often retain the same function.\n- **Paralogs**: Homologs found within the same species that arose from a gene duplication event. After duplication, the two gene copies can diverge and may acquire new, though often related, functions.\n\nConsider a single gene, which we will call `Gene-X`, within the genome of a specific organism. Through the process of alternative splicing, the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript from `Gene-X` can be processed in two different ways, yielding two distinct, functional protein products: `Protein-X1` and `Protein-X2`. These two proteins are known as protein isoforms or splice variants.\n\nBased on the provided definitions, which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between `Protein-X1` and `Protein-X2`?\n\nA. They are paralogs because they are two distinct, functional proteins encoded within the same genome.\n\nB. They are orthologs because they both originate from the same species and share a related function.\n\nC. They are not considered paralogs because this classification requires the originating genes to have arisen from a gene duplication event, not from post-transcriptional processing of a single gene.\n\nD. They are non-homologous proteins because their different primary sequences, resulting from alternative splicing, mean they did not descend from a common ancestor.\n\nE. They are best described as a specific subclass of paralogs, since alternative splicing is functionally equivalent to gene duplication in creating protein diversity.", "solution": "We begin from the standard evolutionary definitions. Homologs are proteins related by descent from a common ancestor. Among homologs, orthologs are those that diverged due to a speciation event and are therefore typically found in different species, while paralogs are those that diverged due to a gene duplication event and can coexist within the same genome. \n\nAlternative splicing produces multiple protein isoforms from a single gene without any gene duplication. The resulting proteins, although differing in primary sequence due to differential exon inclusion, derive from the same genomic locus and the same ancestral gene. Therefore, they are isoforms (splice variants) rather than paralogs or orthologs. They are certainly homologous in the broad sense, since both sequences come from the same ancestral gene; having different primary sequences does not negate common ancestry.\n\nEvaluating the options: A is incorrect because paralogy requires a gene duplication event, which is absent in alternative splicing. B is incorrect because orthologs are defined across species after speciation, not within a single species. C correctly states that they are not considered paralogs because paralogy requires gene duplication, not post-transcriptional processing. D is incorrect because the isoforms are homologous; they share a common origin from the same gene. E is incorrect because alternative splicing is not functionally equivalent to gene duplication in evolutionary terms; isoforms are not categorized as paralogs.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2136510"}, {"introduction": "With the core definitions established, the next step is to interpret them visually within a phylogenetic tree, the primary tool for depicting evolutionary relationships. This problem uses the textbook example of the globin gene family—including alpha-globins, beta-globins, and myoglobin—to build your skill in reading tree diagrams. Identifying the specific node that represents the ancestral gene duplication event separating the alpha- and beta-globin lineages is a fundamental skill for inferring the evolutionary history of any gene family [@problem_id:2136489].", "problem": "In molecular evolution, genes that share a common ancestor are called homologs. Homology can be further subdivided. Orthologs are homologous genes found in different species that diverged from a common ancestral gene during a speciation event. Paralogs are homologous genes within a single species (or across species) that arose from a gene duplication event. Understanding the distinction is key to interpreting gene function and evolutionary history.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist has reconstructed the phylogeny of several globin genes from humans and chickens. The resulting unscaled phylogenetic tree, showing only the branching pattern (topology), is represented in a nested text format as follows:\n\n`(Myoglobin_Human, ((Alpha_Human, Alpha_Chicken), (Beta_Human, Beta_Chicken)));`\n\nIn this format, items grouped within a pair of parentheses share a more recent common ancestor with each other than with items outside the parentheses. For example, `(A, B)` means A and B are each other's closest relatives in the tree.\n\nGiven this phylogenetic tree, which of the following nodes represents the ancestral gene duplication event that gave rise to the distinct alpha- and beta-globin gene families?\n\nA. The most recent common ancestor of Alpha_Human and Alpha_Chicken.\n\nB. The most recent common ancestor of Beta_Human and Beta_Chicken.\n\nC. The most recent common ancestor of all the alpha- and beta-globins in the tree.\n\nD. The most recent common ancestor of all genes in the tree, including Myoglobin_Human.", "solution": "The goal is to identify the node on the phylogenetic tree that corresponds to the gene duplication event separating the alpha-globin and beta-globin lineages. To do this, we must analyze the relationships described by the tree structure: `(Myoglobin_Human, ((Alpha_Human, Alpha_Chicken), (Beta_Human, Beta_Chicken)))`.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the tree topology tells us.\n- The outermost branching splits `Myoglobin_Human` from the rest of the genes. This means myoglobin is the outgroup to this set of alpha- and beta-globins.\n- The next level of branching is `((Alpha_Human, Alpha_Chicken), (Beta_Human, Beta_Chicken))`. This node splits the tree into two main clades (groups): one containing all the alpha-globins and another containing all the beta-globins.\n- Within the alpha-globin clade, the structure is `(Alpha_Human, Alpha_Chicken)`. This means the human alpha-globin and chicken alpha-globin share a common ancestor.\n- Similarly, within the beta-globin clade, the structure is `(Beta_Human, Beta_Chicken)`, meaning the human and chicken beta-globins share a common ancestor.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on the definitions of orthologs and paralogs.\n- Orthologs arise from speciation. On a tree, a speciation node is the common ancestor of the same gene in different species.\n- Paralogs arise from gene duplication. On a tree, a duplication node is the common ancestor of different (but homologous) genes. This split predates the subsequent speciation events of the organisms carrying those genes.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\nA. The most recent common ancestor of Alpha_Human and Alpha_Chicken.\nThis node represents the event that led to the divergence of the human alpha-globin gene and the chicken alpha-globin gene. Since these are the *same type* of gene (alpha-globin) in two different species, their divergence is due to the speciation event that separated the evolutionary lineages leading to humans and chickens. Therefore, Alpha_Human and Alpha_Chicken are orthologs, and this node represents a speciation event.\n\nB. The most recent common ancestor of Beta_Human and Beta_Chicken.\nSimilar to option A, this node represents the divergence of the *same type* of gene (beta-globin) in two different species. This is also a speciation event, and Beta_Human and Beta_Chicken are orthologs.\n\nD. The most recent common ancestor of all genes in the tree, including Myoglobin_Human.\nThis node represents the deepest split in the tree, which separates the myoglobin lineage from the hemoglobin (alpha and beta) lineage. This is indeed a gene duplication event, but it is a much more ancient one that created the myoglobin and globin gene families, not the one that separated alpha-globins from beta-globins.\n\nC. The most recent common ancestor of all the alpha- and beta-globins in the tree.\nThis node is the ancestor of two distinct groups: the alpha-globins `(Alpha_Human, Alpha_Chicken)` and the beta-globins `(Beta_Human, Beta_Chicken)`. The event at this node created two separate lineages, one of which would evolve into alpha-globins and the other into beta-globins. This is the definition of a gene duplication event. After this duplication, the two gene copies (pre-alpha and pre-beta) existed in the common ancestor of humans and chickens. Then, as humans and chickens later diverged (speciated), they each inherited a copy of the alpha-globin gene and a copy of the beta-globin gene. Therefore, any alpha-globin is a paralog to any beta-globin (e.g., Alpha_Human is a paralog of Beta_Human). This node correctly identifies the gene duplication event that created the alpha- and beta-globin families.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2136489"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary histories can be complex, often involving large-scale events that create many-to-one or many-to-many gene relationships between species. This final practice explores a realistic scenario involving a whole-genome duplication event that occurred in the fish lineage after its divergence from mammals. By analyzing the relationship between a human protein and its two zebrafish homologs, you will apply your knowledge to a more nuanced case and encounter the important concept of co-orthologs, where one gene in a species is orthologous to multiple paralogous genes in another [@problem_id:2136482].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying a human protein, which we will call h-ProteinX. To find related proteins in other species, the researcher performs a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search using the amino acid sequence of h-ProteinX as a query against the entire translated genome of the zebrafish (*Danio rerio*). The search yields two distinct and statistically significant hits, which we will call z-ProteinY and z-ProteinZ.\n\nFrom evolutionary studies, it is well-established that a whole-genome duplication event occurred in the lineage leading to teleost fishes (including zebrafish) *after* this lineage diverged from the one leading to tetrapods (including humans).\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements most accurately describes the evolutionary relationships between h-ProteinX, z-ProteinY, and z-ProteinZ?\n\nA. h-ProteinX is an ortholog of z-ProteinY, and h-ProteinX is a paralog of z-ProteinZ.\n\nB. z-ProteinY and z-ProteinZ are orthologs of each other.\n\nC. h-ProteinX is a co-ortholog to both z-ProteinY and z-ProteinZ; z-ProteinY and z-ProteinZ are paralogs.\n\nD. h-ProteinX, z-ProteinY, and z-ProteinZ are all paralogs of each other.\n\nE. h-ProteinX is a paralog of both z-ProteinY and z-ProteinZ.", "solution": "Define orthology and paralogy. Orthologs are homologous genes that diverged due to a speciation event, whereas paralogs are homologous genes that diverged due to a duplication event within a lineage.\n\nEstablish the species history and timing of events. The teleost-specific whole-genome duplication occurred in the lineage leading to zebrafish after the divergence from the lineage leading to humans. Therefore, consider an ancestral gene in the common ancestor of tetrapods and teleosts. After the human-teleost split, the zebrafish lineage experienced a duplication producing two copies, which are now observed as z-ProteinY and z-ProteinZ. The human lineage retained a single copy, h-ProteinX.\n\nInfer gene relationships from event timing. Because the duplication producing z-ProteinY and z-ProteinZ occurred after the human-teleost split, both zebrafish genes trace back to the single pre-duplication ancestral gene that is also ancestral to h-ProteinX. Consequently, h-ProteinX is orthologous to each of z-ProteinY and z-ProteinZ; specifically, they are co-orthologs of h-ProteinX. Within zebrafish, z-ProteinY and z-ProteinZ arose by duplication and are therefore paralogs (often called ohnologs following whole-genome duplication).\n\nEvaluate answer choices:\n- A is incorrect because the duplication occurred after speciation; thus h-ProteinX cannot be a paralog of z-ProteinZ.\n- B is incorrect because z-ProteinY and z-ProteinZ are not orthologs; they are paralogs.\n- C is correct: h-ProteinX is a co-ortholog to both z-ProteinY and z-ProteinZ, and z-ProteinY and z-ProteinZ are paralogs.\n- D is incorrect because not all three are paralogs; cross-species relationships here are orthology.\n- E is incorrect because h-ProteinX is not a paralog of the zebrafish genes given the post-speciation duplication.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2136482"}]}
