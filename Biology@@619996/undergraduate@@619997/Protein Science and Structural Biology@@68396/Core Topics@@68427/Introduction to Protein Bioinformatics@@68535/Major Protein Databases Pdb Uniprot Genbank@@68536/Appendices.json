Researchers frequently encounter conflicting information across databases, and reconciling these differences requires a deep understanding of the underlying biology and experimental methods. This advanced problem challenges you to deduce the origins of several sequence discrepancies by considering concepts like signal peptides, genetic polymorphisms, site-directed mutagenesis, and protein purification tags, showcasing how these databases work together to tell a complete molecular story [@problem_id:2118098].", "problem": "An advanced undergraduate student is conducting a bioinformatic analysis of a hypothetical human protein, Neuregulin-X (NRGX), which is known to be a secreted signaling molecule. The student gathers sequence information from three primary public databases: the Protein Data Bank (PDB), UniProt, and GenBank. Upon aligning the sequences, the student identifies four key discrepancies.\n\nThe sequences under consideration are:\n-   **S_UniProt**: The canonical sequence for human NRGX from its UniProt entry, which is considered the reference proteome sequence.\n-   **S_GenBank**: The protein sequence obtained by translating the an open-access Coding DNA Sequence (CDS) from a large-scale population sequencing study, deposited in the GenBank database.\n-   **S_PDB**: The amino acid sequence listed in the `SEQRES` records of a recently deposited PDB entry, which reports the crystal structure of NRGX expressed in an *Escherichia coli* host system.\n\nThe student makes the following four observations. All residue numbering is based on the full-length S_UniProt sequence.\n\nI. S_PDB is missing the first 22 amino acids that are present at the N-terminus of S_UniProt. The S_GenBank sequence, when inferred from the full gene, contains these same 22 amino acids.\nII. At position 95, S_UniProt contains a Valine (V), while both S_GenBank and S_PDB contain an Isoleucine (I).\nIII. At position 314, S_PDB contains an Alanine (A), while both S_UniProt and S_GenBank contain a Cysteine (C).\nIV. S_PDB has an additional six-residue tail at its C-terminus (`-HHHHHH`) that is absent in both S_UniProt and S_GenBank.\n\nBased on your knowledge of molecular biology, protein biochemistry, and bioinformatics, select the option below that presents the most scientifically plausible and consistent set of explanations for all four discrepancies.\n\nA. I: The protein underwent alternative splicing, removing the first exon. II: The Valine in UniProt is a result of post-translational deamination. III: A sequencing error occurred during the PDB structure determination. IV: The C-terminal tail is a naturally occurring, but rare, isoform.\n\nB. I: An alternative, downstream start codon was used for transcription. II: The UniProt entry has a known annotation error at position 95. III: This is a common Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP). IV: The C-terminal tail is a small molecule ligand that co-crystallized with the protein.\n\nC. I: The N-terminus was proteolytically degraded during the purification process for crystallization. II: The Isoleucine at position 95 is the result of an RNA editing event. III: The Alanine at 314 is due to a post-translational modification. IV: The C-terminal tail is the result of translational read-through of the stop codon.\n\nD. I: The construct for the PDB entry was designed to express only the mature form of the protein, omitting the N-terminal signal peptide. II: The V95I variation represents a common Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), and the PDB experiment used a construct based on the allele found in the GenBank population study. III: The C314A mutation was a deliberate site-directed mutation introduced to improve protein stability or prevent aggregation during crystallization. IV: The C-terminal tail is a poly-histidine affinity tag, a common cloning artifact used for protein purification.\n\nE. I: The N-terminus of S_PDB was too disordered to be modeled in the crystal structure. II: The S_GenBank entry is from a different primate species. III: The C314A change is due to a different alternative splicing event. IV: The C-terminal tail is part of a fusion protein construct that was not cleaved.", "solution": "We analyze each discrepancy in light of standard molecular biology and structural biology practices, ensuring consistency across S_UniProt (canonical human sequence), S_GenBank (population-derived CDS translation), and S_PDB (SEQRES of an E. coli-expressed crystallization construct).\n\nFor observation I (S_PDB missing the first 22 residues present in S_UniProt, while S_GenBank retains them): Secreted human proteins typically include an N-terminal signal peptide of approximately 20 to 30 residues that directs secretion and is not part of the mature secreted form. For recombinant expression and crystallography in E. coli, it is standard practice to design constructs that omit the eukaryotic signal peptide to express the soluble mature domain in the bacterial cytoplasm. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that the PDB construct was designed without the signal peptide. This aligns with option D.I. Alternative splicing removing the first exon (A.I) is inconsistent with S_GenBank containing the same N-terminus as S_UniProt. Use of a downstream start codon for transcription (B.I) is conceptually incorrect (start codons are used in translation) and would not selectively affect only the PDB construct if the gene sequence itself encodes the signal peptide. Proteolytic degradation (C.I) is less likely to remove exactly the signal peptide region reproducibly, and SEQRES absence implies the segment was not present in the construct. Disorder preventing modeling (E.I) does not apply because SEQRES lists the intended construct sequence; disordered regions fail to appear in ATOM records, not SEQRES.\n\nFor observation II (V at position 95 in S_UniProt versus I in both S_GenBank and S_PDB): Valine to isoleucine is a conservative amino acid substitution compatible with a common single nucleotide polymorphism. A population sequencing study (source of S_GenBank) often reports allelic variants, and a lab may clone and express the allele they have access to, producing the same variant in S_PDB. This is well explained by option D.II. Post-translational deamination (A.II) does not convert valine to isoleucine; deamination affects side chains like asparagine to aspartate or glutamine to glutamate, not aliphatic residues. Claiming a UniProt annotation error (B.II) is ad hoc without evidence and is less plausible than a known SNP reflected in population data. RNA editing (C.II) typically involves A-to-I (read as G) or C-to-U changes and is not known to convert codons encoding valine (GUU/GUC/GUA/GUG) to codons for isoleucine (AUU/AUC/AUA) in a manner consistent with human mRNA editing. Different species (E.II) contradicts the stated human origin of the GenBank population dataset.\n\nFor observation III (A at position 314 in S_PDB versus C in S_UniProt and S_GenBank): Cysteines can cause heterogeneity via disulfide formation, oxidation, or mispairing, which can impair folding, solubility, or crystallization. It is a standard protein engineering practice to mutate nonessential cysteines to alanine or serine to improve stability and crystallizability. Therefore, a deliberate C314A mutation introduced for stability or aggregation prevention during crystallization is most consistent (D.III). A sequencing error during structure determination (A.III) is unlikely because PDB entries report the construct sequence used; structure determination itself does not typically produce a different residue identity in SEQRES. Calling it a common SNP (B.III) is inconsistent with both UniProt and the population GenBank sequence having cysteine. Post-translational modifications (C.III) do not convert cysteine into alanine; PTMs add chemical groups but do not change the amino acid identity in the sequence. Alternative splicing (E.III) does not yield a single-residue substitution at an identical position; it changes exon composition and often domain architecture.\n\nFor observation IV (a C-terminal -HHHHHH tail present only in S_PDB): A hexahistidine tail is a canonical polyhistidine affinity tag used for immobilized metal affinity chromatography, commonly appended at the C-terminus for purification, especially in bacterial expression systems. This exactly matches D.IV. It is not a natural isoform (A.IV), not a small-molecule ligand (B.IV), not translational read-through (C.IV), and while it is a type of fusion-derived tag (E.IV), option E fails on the other parts.\n\nThus, only option D provides a complete, scientifically standard, and internally consistent explanation for all four observations: omission of a signal peptide in the PDB construct, a common SNP explaining V95I mirrored in the population dataset and PDB construct, a deliberate C314A stabilizing mutation for crystallization, and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag for purification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2118098"}]}
