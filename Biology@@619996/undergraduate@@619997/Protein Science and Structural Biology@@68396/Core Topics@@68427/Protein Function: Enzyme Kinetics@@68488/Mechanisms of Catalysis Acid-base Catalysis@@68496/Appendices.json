This first practice explores a cornerstone of acid-base catalysis: how the local environment alters the chemical properties of amino acid side chains. Understanding the principles behind pKa shifts is crucial, as it explains how enzymes can fine-tune residues to perform specific catalytic roles at physiological pH, a concept clearly illustrated in this thought experiment about a catalytic histidine [@problem_id:2118377].", "problem": "In the active site of a hypothetical enzyme operating at a physiological pH of 7.4, a histidine residue is crucial for catalysis. Its imidazole side chain (with a typical pKa of 6.0 in isolation) must function as a general acid catalyst, meaning it must donate a proton. Structural analysis reveals that this catalytic histidine is located in close proximity to the side chain of an aspartate residue, which is negatively charged at this pH.\n\nConsidering the electrostatic interaction between these two residues, how does the presence of the nearby negatively charged aspartate affect the ability of the histidine to function as a general acid catalyst at physiological pH?\n\nA. It enhances this ability because the aspartate's negative charge stabilizes the protonated (positively charged) form of histidine, increasing its pKa and thus increasing the concentration of the protonated form available to act as an acid at physiological pH.\n\nB. It hinders this ability because the aspartate stabilizes the protonated form of histidine, increasing its pKa. This makes the histidine a weaker acid, and therefore less effective at proton donation.\n\nC. It enhances this ability because the aspartate's negative charge repels the proton on the histidine, lowering its pKa and making it a stronger acid and a more potent proton donor.\n\nD. It has no significant effect, because the catalytic activity of histidine is an intrinsic chemical property and is not influenced by non-covalent interactions with neighboring residues.\n\nE. It hinders this ability because the aspartate extracts the proton from the histidine before the substrate can bind, rendering the histidine incapable of acting as a general acid.", "solution": "We identify the relevant acid-base equilibrium for the histidine side chain:\n$$\\text{HisH}^{+} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{His} + \\text{H}^{+}.$$\nFor general acid catalysis, the residue must be in the conjugate acid form $\\text{HisH}^{+}$ so that it can donate $\\text{H}^{+}$.\n\nAt a fixed $pH$, the ratio of deprotonated to protonated forms is governed by the Hendersonâ€“Hasselbalch relation:\n$$pH = pK_{a} + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\text{His}]}{[\\text{HisH}^{+}]}\\right).$$\nRearranging gives\n$$\\frac{[\\text{His}]}{[\\text{HisH}^{+}]} = 10^{\\,pH - pK_{a}}.$$\nDefine $R \\equiv \\frac{[\\text{His}]}{[\\text{HisH}^{+}]}$.

This stabilization increases $pK_{a}$ by some positive shift $\\Delta pK_{a}$, giving an effective $pK_{a}^{\\prime} = pK_{a} + \\Delta pK_{a}$ with $\\Delta pK_{a} > 0$. Substituting $pK_{a}^{\\prime}$ into the expression for $R$,\n$$R^{\\prime} = 10^{\\,pH - pK_{a}^{\\prime}} = 10^{\\,pH - (pK_{a} + \\Delta pK_{a})} = 10^{\\,pH - pK_{a}} \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta pK_{a}}.$$\nSince $\\Delta pK_{a} > 0$, it follows that $R^{\\prime} < R$, hence\n$$f_{\\text{HisH}^{+}}^{\\prime} = \\frac{1}{1 + R^{\\prime}} > \\frac{1}{1 + R} = f_{\\text{HisH}^{+}}.$$\n\nTherefore, at physiological $pH$, increasing $pK_{a}$ via stabilization by the nearby aspartate increases the fraction of histidine in the protonated form that can act as a general acid. This enhances its ability to donate a proton during catalysis. This corresponds to option A; options B, C, D, and E either misstate the effect of a negative charge on $pK_{a}$, conflate intrinsic acidity with availability of the protonated form at given $pH$, deny local electrostatic effects, or posit an obligatory deprotonation that is not necessitated by the interaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2118377"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of pKa modulation, this next practice provides a quantitative challenge to connect theory to measurable outcomes.

This exercise will challenge you to synthesize chemical principles with structural biology to make a well-reasoned prediction about catalytic activity.", "problem": "A hypothetical enzyme, xylo-isomerase, catalyzes the conversion of its substrate via a mechanism involving general acid-base catalysis. The active site features a critical Glutamate residue (Glu-35) that acts as a general base, abstracting a proton from the substrate's hydroxyl group in the rate-limiting step. The optimal activity for this enzyme is observed at a physiological pH of 7.4. In the unique microenvironment of the active site, the side chain of Glu-35 has a pKa of 4.6.\n\nA research team creates a mutant version of the enzyme where Glu-35 is replaced by an Aspartate residue (a G35D mutation). The overall three-dimensional structure of the mutant enzyme is found to be nearly identical to the wild-type enzyme. In the mutant's active site, the side chain of the new Asp-35 residue has a pKa of 4.1.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the effect of the G35D mutation on the enzyme's catalytic activity at pH 7.4?\n\nA. The catalytic activity will likely decrease significantly because Aspartate is a weaker base than Glutamate and its shorter side chain may be sub-optimally positioned to abstract the proton.\n\nB.

The catalytic activity will be completely abolished because the Aspartate side chain is too short to reach the substrate.\n\nE. The catalytic activity will likely decrease because the Aspartate side chain is bulkier than Glutamate, causing steric hindrance in the active site.", "solution": "We identify the catalytic role: Glu-35 acts as a general base in the rate-limiting step, so it must be in its deprotonated carboxylate form to abstract a proton from the substrate hydroxyl.

Therefore, the availability of the deprotonated base is not limiting for either Glu-35 or Asp-35 at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$.\n\nNext, consider intrinsic basicity. For general base catalysis, the ability to abstract a proton scales with the basicity of the side chain, which correlates with the $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ of its conjugate acid: higher $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ indicates a stronger base. Here, $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}^{\\text{Glu-35}}=4.6$ is greater than $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}^{\\text{Asp-35}}=4.1$, so Glu-35 is the stronger base than Asp-35. When proton transfer is part of the rate-limiting step, a weaker base is expected to increase the activation barrier, decreasing the catalytic rate, all else equal.\n\nFurthermore, geometric positioning is critical in general acid-base catalysis. Proton transfer rates typically decay with increasing donorâ€“acceptor distance, often modeled qualitatively as\n$$\nk \\propto \\exp(-\\alpha r),\n$$\nwith $r$ the donorâ€“acceptor distance and $\\alpha>0$ a decay parameter. Aspartate has a side chain shorter by one methylene group relative to glutamate, which may render the carboxylate sub-optimally positioned to abstract the substrate proton in an active site whose overall fold is unchanged. This geometric shortening can further reduce the rate of proton abstraction even if the residue remains deprotonated at the working pH.\n\nCombining these effects:\n- Protonation state at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$ is favorable for both residues, so not determinative.\n- Intrinsic basicity is lower for Asp-35 than Glu-35, disfavouring proton abstraction in the rate-limiting step.\n- The shorter side chain of Asp-35 can impair optimal positioning for proton transfer.\n\nTherefore, the mutation is expected to decrease catalytic activity, but not abolish it outright, and not increase it. Among the options, the statement that matches these considerations is that activity will likely decrease significantly due to the weaker base and suboptimal positioning of the shorter Asp side chain.\n\nOptions B, C, D, and E are inconsistent with these principles: B incorrectly equates greater acidity with improved general base catalysis; C ignores differences in basicity and geometry; D overstates the effect to complete loss of activity despite near-identity of the structure; E incorrectly claims increased bulk for Asp relative to Glu.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2118366"}]}
