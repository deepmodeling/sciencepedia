This exercise [@problem_id:2110056] walks you through a classic biochemical experiment that uses dialysis to determine if an enzyme is active on its own (as an apoenzyme) or if it requires a small, non-covalently bound molecule to form a catalytically active holoenzyme. Mastering this experimental logic is a fundamental skill for characterizing any newly discovered enzyme.", "problem": "A biochemist has isolated and purified a novel enzyme, which she names \"Fructo-isomerase X,\" from a bacterial source. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of substrate F to product I. The initial preparation of the enzyme shows a high catalytic rate. To investigate the enzyme's composition and requirements for activity, the biochemist performs the following experiment.\n\nA solution containing the purified Fructo-isomerase X is placed inside a dialysis bag. This bag is made of a semipermeable membrane that allows the passage of small molecules and ions but retains large molecules like proteins. The bag is then submerged in a large volume of buffer solution and allowed to equilibrate for an extended period, a process known as dialysis.\n\nAfter dialysis, the enzyme solution from inside the bag is collected (let's call this \"Dialyzed Enzyme\"). The buffer solution from outside the bag, which now contains any small molecules that diffused out of the bag, is also collected and concentrated (let's call this the \"Dialysate\").\n\nThe biochemist then measures the catalytic activity in three different setups:\n1. The original, undialyzed enzyme solution.\n2. The \"Dialyzed Enzyme\" solution.\n3. The \"Dialyzed Enzyme\" solution with the concentrated \"Dialysate\" added back to it.\n\nAssuming Fructo-isomerase X is an enzyme that requires a small, non-covalently bound organic molecule as a coenzyme to be active, which of the following outcomes would be expected from this experiment?\n\nA. The activity of the Dialyzed Enzyme will be high, and adding the Dialysate will cause a decrease in activity.\n\nB. The activity of the Dialyzed Enzyme will be low, and adding the Dialysate will restore the high activity.\n\nC. The activity of the Dialyzed Enzyme will remain high, and adding the Dialysate will have no effect.\n\nD. The activity of the Dialyzed Enzyme will be low, and adding the Dialysate will have no effect.\n\nE. All three setups will show no enzymatic activity as the purification process must have denatured the enzyme.", "solution": "Define the active species and binding equilibrium. Let $E$ denote the apoenzyme (protein alone), $C$ the required small, non-covalently bound organic coenzyme, and $EC$ the holoenzyme complex that is catalytically active. The binding equilibrium is\n$$\nE + C \\rightleftharpoons EC,\n$$\nwith dissociation constant\n$$\nK_{d} = \\frac{[E][C]}{[EC]}.\n$$\nFor a given total enzyme concentration $[E]_{T} = [E] + [EC]$, the fraction of enzyme present as active holoenzyme is\n$$\nf = \\frac{[EC]}{[E]_{T}} = \\frac{[C]}{[C] + K_{d}},\n$$\nand at fixed, saturating substrate $F$, the catalytic rate is proportional to $[EC]$, so\n$$\nv \\propto [EC] = [E]_{T}\\,\\frac{[C]}{[C] + K_{d}}.\n$$\n\nAnalyze the effect of dialysis using physical principles of diffusion through a semipermeable membrane. Dialysis employs a membrane permeable to small molecules (such as $C$) but not to proteins (such as $E$ or $EC$), and the external buffer volume is large, acting effectively as a sink. Small molecules inside the bag diffuse out down their concentration gradients until equilibrium is reached. Because $C$ is small and non-covalently bound, the equilibrium $E + C \\rightleftharpoons EC$ will shift as $C$ is removed from the interior; by Le Chatelier’s principle and mass action, lowering $[C]$ drives dissociation of $EC$ to release $C$. Consequently, after extensive dialysis, the interior $[C]$ approaches zero and\n$$\n\\lim_{[C]\\to 0} [EC] = [E]_{T}\\,\\frac{[C]}{[C] + K_{d}} \\to 0,\n$$\nso the dialyzed enzyme has low activity.\n\nAccount for the dialysate and reconstitution. The dialysate (the external buffer collected and concentrated) now contains the small molecules that diffused out, including the coenzyme $C$. Adding the concentrated dialysate back to the dialyzed enzyme increases $[C]$ in the enzyme solution. As $[C]$ increases, the equilibrium shifts toward complex formation, and\n$$\n[EC] = [E]_{T}\\,\\frac{[C]}{[C] + K_{d}}\n$$\nrises toward its original value, restoring activity. Therefore:\n- Original undialyzed enzyme: high activity (initial $[C]$ present, $f$ high).\n- Dialyzed enzyme: low activity (small $[C]$, $f \\approx 0$).\n- Dialyzed enzyme plus concentrated dialysate: restored high activity (added $C$ raises $[C]$, $f$ increases).\n\nThese expectations match the outcome where removing a non-covalently bound coenzyme by dialysis reduces activity, and re-adding it via the dialysate restores activity. This corresponds to option B. (Options A, C, D, and E conflict with the principles above: A predicts inhibition by dialysate; C would fit a covalently or tightly bound prosthetic group not removed by dialysis; D would require that the necessary small factor not be present in the dialysate or not required; E contradicts the initial observation of high activity.)", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2110056"}, {"introduction": "Beyond cofactors, the specific amino acids lining the active site are the primary architects of an enzyme's catalytic power. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2110043] introduces the powerful technique of site-directed mutagenesis to probe the crucial role of electrostatic interactions in catalysis. By predicting how a single mutation that reverses a residue's charge will affect substrate binding ($K_M$) and turnover ($k_{cat}$), you will forge a direct link between the chemical properties of amino acids and an enzyme's kinetic profile.", "problem": "An enzyme, \"substratase,\" catalyzes the conversion of a specific substrate, molecule S, into a product. The active site of substratase contains a key aspartate residue at position 95 (Asp-95). At physiological pH, this Asp-95 residue is known to form a crucial ionic bond with a positively charged region of the substrate S, thereby anchoring it in the correct orientation for catalysis. A researcher performs a site-directed mutagenesis experiment and creates a mutant version of substratase where Asp-95 is replaced by a lysine residue (Lys-95).\n\nAssume standard physiological pH for all enzyme activity assays. Let $K_M$ be the Michaelis constant and $k_{cat}$ be the turnover number for the reaction. Which of the following statements most accurately predicts the change in the kinetic parameters for the mutant enzyme compared to the wild-type enzyme?\n\nA. $K_M$ will increase, and $k_{cat}$ will decrease.\n\nB. $K_M$ will decrease, and $k_{cat}$ will increase.\n\nC. $K_M$ will increase, and $k_{cat}$ will remain relatively unchanged.\n\nD. $K_M$ will decrease, and $k_{cat}$ will decrease.\n\nE. $K_M$ will remain relatively unchanged, and $k_{cat}$ will decrease.", "solution": "Consider the standard Michaelis–Menten scheme:\n$$\nE + S \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{-1}]{k_{1}} ES \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{cat}}} E + P\n$$\nwith\n$$\nv=\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{T}[S]}{K_{M}+[S]}, \\quad K_{M}=\\frac{k_{-1}+k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{1}}.\n$$\nAt physiological pH, an aspartate side chain is deprotonated and negatively charged, whereas a lysine side chain is protonated and positively charged. In the wild-type enzyme, Asp-95 engages in a favorable ionic interaction with a positively charged region of the substrate, stabilizing the ES complex and orienting the substrate for catalysis. Replacing Asp-95 with Lys-95 removes this favorable electrostatic attraction and instead introduces an electrostatic repulsion with the same positively charged substrate region.\n\nConsequences for binding and thus for $K_{M}$:\n- Loss of the favorable ionic bond and introduction of repulsion will weaken ES binding. In kinetic terms, the association step becomes less favorable (effective decrease in $k_{1}$) and/or the ES complex becomes less stable (effective increase in $k_{-1}$).\n- From $K_{M}=(k_{-1}+k_{\\text{cat}})/k_{1}$, a decrease in $k_{1}$ and/or an increase in $k_{-1}$ increases $K_{M}$.\nTherefore, $K_{M}$ is expected to increase.\n\nConsequences for $k_{\\text{cat}}$:\n- The prompt specifies that the ionic bond at Asp-95 is “crucial” for anchoring the substrate in the correct orientation for catalysis. Loss of correct orientation typically slows the chemical step in the active site because properly aligned catalytic groups are required to lower the activation barrier. Thus, even if Asp-95 is not a direct acid/base or covalent catalyst, disrupting orientation commonly reduces $k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n- Introducing a positively charged Lys at that position may further distort the active site electrostatics, compounding misorientation and possibly destabilizing the transition state, which also tends to decrease $k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n\nPutting these effects together, the most accurate prediction is that $K_{M}$ will increase and $k_{\\text{cat}}$ will decrease.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2110043"}, {"introduction": "An enzyme's function is defined as much by the substrates it rejects as by the one it accepts—a property known as substrate specificity. This problem [@problem_id:2110055] delves into the principle of steric hindrance, challenging you to predict how altering the size of an active site residue impacts the enzyme's preference for different substrates. This practice illuminates the structural basis of enzyme specificity and offers a glimpse into the foundational principles of rational protein engineering.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a hypothetical enzyme, \"Malonate Decarboxylase,\" which catalyzes the conversion of its primary substrate, malonate, to acetate and carbon dioxide. The active site of this enzyme contains a deep binding pocket perfectly contoured to fit the small malonate molecule (structure: HOOC-CH₂-COOH). At the base of this pocket lies a glycine residue, whose small size (side chain: -H) provides the necessary space for malonate to bind optimally.\n\nThe biochemist observes that the wild-type enzyme also exhibits a very low level of activity towards a larger, structurally similar molecule, ethylmalonate (structure: HOOC-CH(CH₂CH₃)-COOH). To investigate the structural basis of this specificity, a site-directed mutagenesis experiment is performed, replacing the glycine residue at the base of the pocket with a phenylalanine residue (side chain: a bulky, nonpolar benzyl group).\n\nThe catalytic efficiency of an enzyme for a particular substrate is quantified by the specificity constant, which is the ratio of the catalytic rate constant ($k_{cat}$) to the Michaelis constant ($K_M$). A higher specificity constant indicates a greater catalytic efficiency. The enzyme's preference for one substrate (A) over another (B) can be evaluated by comparing their respective specificity constants, i.e., by the ratio $(k_{cat}/K_M)_A / (k_{cat}/K_M)_B$.\n\nBased on the principles of enzyme structure and function, how would this glycine-to-phenylalanine mutation most likely alter the enzyme's substrate preference?\n\nA. The enzyme’s preference for malonate over ethylmalonate will increase.\n\nB. The enzyme’s preference for ethylmalonate over malonate will increase.\n\nC. The mutation will decrease catalytic efficiency for both substrates to a similar degree, leaving the substrate preference largely unchanged.\n\nD. The enzyme will become completely inactive towards both substrates.\n\nE. The mutation will increase the catalytic efficiency for both substrates due to new hydrophobic interactions.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of mutating a small glycine (Gly) residue to a bulky phenylalanine (Phe) residue in the substrate-binding pocket of Malonate Decarboxylase. We need to assess how this change affects the enzyme's preference for its small native substrate, malonate, versus a larger alternative substrate, ethylmalonate.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Wild-Type Enzyme:** The wild-type enzyme has a glycine at the base of its active site pocket. Glycine's side chain is just a hydrogen atom, making it the smallest amino acid. This creates a pocket with maximal space, perfectly accommodating the small malonate substrate. The larger ethylmalonate can also bind, but its bulkier ethyl group likely causes a suboptimal fit, resulting in a lower binding affinity (higher $K_M$) and/or a less efficient catalysis (lower $k_{cat}$) compared to malonate. Therefore, for the wild-type enzyme, the specificity constant for malonate, $(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{malonate}}$, is significantly higher than for ethylmalonate, $(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{ethylmalonate}}$. The enzyme strongly prefers malonate.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mutation:** The mutation replaces glycine with phenylalanine. Phenylalanine has a large, rigid, and nonpolar benzyl side chain. This bulky group will now protrude into the space at the base of the active site pocket that was previously unoccupied. This is a classic example of introducing steric hindrance.\n\n3.  **Effect on Malonate (Small Substrate):** The binding of malonate will be affected by the new bulky phenylalanine. The pocket is now more crowded. While malonate is small and may still be able to bind, the fit will be less ideal than in the wild-type enzyme. This steric clash will likely decrease its binding affinity (increase its $K_M$) and could also distort the geometry required for the catalytic reaction, thus decreasing the catalytic rate (lower $k_{cat}$). The overall catalytic efficiency, $(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{malonate}}$, for the mutant enzyme is expected to decrease compared to the wild-type.\n\n4.  **Effect on Ethylmalonate (Large Substrate):** The binding of ethylmalonate, which was already a tight fit in the wild-type enzyme due to its ethyl group, will be much more severely affected. The large phenylalanine side chain will clash significantly with the ethyl group of the substrate. This severe steric hindrance will make it extremely difficult for ethylmalonate to enter and bind productively in the active site. This will cause a very large increase in its $K_M$ (dramatically reduced binding affinity) and likely a very large decrease in its $k_{cat}$, as correct positioning for catalysis will be nearly impossible. The reduction in the specificity constant, $(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{ethylmalonate}}$, will be much more drastic than the reduction seen for malonate.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Change in Preference:** We are interested in the ratio of the specificity constants, which represents substrate preference:\n    $$ \\text{Preference for Malonate} = \\frac{(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{malonate}}}{(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{ethylmalonate}}} $$\n    Let's compare this ratio for the wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) enzymes.\n    - For the WT, this ratio is large and positive, indicating a strong preference for malonate.\n    - For the MUT, the numerator, $(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{malonate}}$, decreases. However, the denominator, $(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{ethylmalonate}}$, decreases much more dramatically, possibly approaching zero.\n    When a fraction's numerator decreases slightly but its denominator decreases drastically, the value of the fraction as a whole increases.\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{malonate}}}{(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{ethylmalonate}}} \\right)_{\\text{MUT}} > \\left( \\frac{(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{malonate}}}{(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{ethylmalonate}}} \\right)_{\\text{WT}} $$\n    Therefore, the mutant enzyme's relative preference for malonate over ethylmalonate will increase. It becomes an even more selective (though less efficient overall) catalyst for the smaller substrate.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A. The enzyme’s preference for malonate over ethylmalonate will increase. This matches our reasoning. The enzyme's ability to process the larger substrate is almost eliminated, while its ability to process the smaller substrate is only moderately hindered, thus increasing the relative selectivity.\n    *   B. The enzyme’s preference for ethylmalonate over malonate will increase. This is incorrect. The bulky Phe group would clash with the ethyl group, not favor it.\n    *   C. The mutation will decrease catalytic efficiency for both substrates to a similar degree... This is incorrect because the steric effect is highly dependent on the size of the substrate. The larger substrate is affected disproportionately.\n    *   D. The enzyme will become completely inactive towards both substrates. This is too extreme. While the activity will decrease, complete inactivation from a single, non-catalytic residue mutation is not guaranteed, especially for the small native substrate.\n    *   E. The mutation will increase the catalytic efficiency for both substrates... This is incorrect. The introduction of steric bulk into a well-defined pocket is almost always detrimental to binding and catalysis for the original substrates.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the mutation makes the enzyme more selective for the smaller substrate, malonate, by disproportionately penalizing the binding and turnover of the larger substrate, ethylmalonate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2110055"}]}
