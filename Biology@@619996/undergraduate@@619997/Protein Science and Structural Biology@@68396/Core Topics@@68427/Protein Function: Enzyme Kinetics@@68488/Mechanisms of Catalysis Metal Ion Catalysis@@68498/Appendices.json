It is hypothesized that FKM is a metalloenzyme, requiring a divalent metal cation for its activity. To test this hypothesis, a series of kinetic assays are performed. The initial reaction rate ($v_0$) is measured under four different conditions, each with constant and saturating concentrations of the substrates, fructose and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nThe conditions and the resulting initial rates are as follows:\n\n*   **Condition A (Control):** A standard reaction buffer containing the FKM enzyme. The measured initial rate is $v_A = 150.0$ $\\mu \\text{M/min}$.\n*   **Condition B (Chelation):** The standard reaction buffer from Condition A with the addition of a high concentration of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a molecule that strongly binds and sequesters divalent metal cations. The measured initial rate is $v_B = 5.0$ $\\mu \\text{M/min}$.\n*   **Condition C (Mg²⁺ Restoration):** The mixture from Condition B is further supplemented with a large excess of magnesium chloride (MgCl₂), a source of Mg²⁺ ions. The measured initial rate is $v_C = 145.0$ $\\mu \\text{M/min}$.\n*   **Condition D (Ca²⁺ Trial):** A separate mixture identical to Condition B is supplemented with a large excess of calcium chloride (CaCl₂), a source of Ca²⁺ ions, instead of MgCl₂. The measured initial rate is $v_D = 6.0$ $\\mu \\text{M/min}$.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following conclusions is the most strongly supported?\n\nA. FKM does not require a metal ion for activity; its activity is directly inhibited by EDTA.\n\nB. FKM is a metalloenzyme that requires Ca²⁺ for its catalytic activity.\n\nC. FKM is a metalloenzyme that requires Mg²⁺ for its catalytic activity.\n\nD. FKM activity is enhanced by the presence of EDTA.\n\nE. FKM requires a divalent metal ion for activity and can use either Mg²⁺ or Ca²⁺ interchangeably.", "solution": "The problem asks us to interpret the results of a set of enzyme kinetics experiments to determine the role of metal ions in the function of the enzyme FructoKinase-M (FKM). We will analyze the result from each condition step-by-step.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the control condition (Condition A).\nThe initial rate in the standard buffer, $v_A = 150.0$ $\\mu \\text{M/min}$, represents the baseline or maximal activity of the enzyme under the given substrate concentrations. This is our reference point.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the effect of the chelating agent (Condition B).\nEDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds tightly to divalent metal ions like Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺, effectively removing them from the solution and preventing them from interacting with the enzyme. In Condition B, the addition of EDTA caused the enzyme's activity to drop drastically to $v_B = 5.0$ $\\mu \\text{M/min}$, which is only about 3.3% of the control activity ($5.0 / 150.0 \\approx 0.033$). This profound loss of activity strongly suggests that a divalent metal ion, which was removed by EDTA, is essential for FKM's catalytic function.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the effect of metal ion restoration (Condition C).\nIn Condition C, an excess of Mg²⁺ was added to the EDTA-treated enzyme solution. This addition restored the enzyme's activity to $v_C = 145.0$ $\\mu \\text{M/min}$, which is approximately 97% of the original activity. The excess Mg²⁺ ions effectively reverse the effect of EDTA by either replenishing the enzyme's essential metal cofactor or by providing the necessary Mg²⁺ for the ATP substrate to form the biologically active Mg-ATP complex. This result confirms that the loss of activity in Condition B was due to the absence of a metal ion and that Mg²⁺ can fulfill the role of this required ion.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the specificity of the metal ion requirement (Condition D).\nIn Condition D, Ca²⁺ was added instead of Mg²⁺ to the EDTA-treated enzyme. The activity remained very low at $v_D = 6.0$ $\\mu \\text{M/min}$, which is almost identical to the inhibited rate in Condition B. This demonstrates that Ca²⁺ cannot restore the enzyme's function. Therefore, the enzyme has a specific requirement for the metal ion; it cannot use just any divalent cation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the conclusions.\n- Option A is incorrect. The restoration of activity by adding Mg²⁺ (Condition C) shows that the enzyme does require a metal ion. EDTA's effect is due to metal chelation, not direct inhibition.\n- Option B is incorrect. Condition D clearly shows that Ca²⁺ fails to restore the enzyme's activity.\n- Option C is correct. The loss of activity with EDTA and its near-full restoration specifically by Mg²⁺ strongly supports the conclusion that FKM is a metalloenzyme that requires Mg²⁺ for its activity.\n- Option D is incorrect. The data shows that EDTA drastically reduces, rather than enhances, FKM activity.\n- Option E is incorrect. The enzyme's requirement is specific. While it requires a divalent metal ion (as shown by EDTA's effect), it cannot use Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ interchangeably, as demonstrated by the results of Condition C versus Condition D.\n\nTherefore, the combined results of the experiments provide strong evidence that FructoKinase-M is a metalloenzyme with a specific requirement for the Mg²⁺ cation for its catalytic activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2118789"}, {"introduction": "A primary role of a catalytic metal ion is to function as a Lewis acid, often by activating a water molecule to become a more potent nucleophile. This exercise explores how the intrinsic properties of the metal, specifically its charge density, dictate its catalytic power. By comparing the effects of zinc ($Zn^{2+}$) and cadmium ($Cd^{2+}$) ions, you will connect a fundamental chemical principle to the efficiency of an enzyme like carbonic anhydrase [@problem_id:2118825].", "problem": "Carbonic anhydrase is a metalloenzyme that plays a crucial role in respiration by catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. The active site of a representative carbonic anhydrase features a Zinc ion ($Zn^{2+}$) coordinated by three histidine residues and a water molecule. A critical step in the catalytic mechanism involves the $Zn^{2+}$ ion acting as a Lewis acid to lower the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ of the coordinated water molecule, thereby generating a potent hydroxide ion nucleophile at physiological pH.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where the native $Zn^{2+}$ ion, which has an ionic radius of approximately 74 pm, is replaced by a Cadmium ion ($Cd^{2+}$), which has an ionic radius of approximately 95 pm. This substitution is known to severely inhibit the enzyme's catalytic activity. Based on the principles of metal ion catalysis, which of the following statements provides the most direct and fundamental chemical explanation for the observed inhibition?\n\nA. The larger $Cd^{2+}$ ion is too big to fit within the catalytic pocket, causing it to be readily displaced by smaller, more abundant ions like $Mg^{2+}$ or $Ca^{2+}$.\n\nB. The $Cd^{2+}$ ion is redox-active under physiological conditions, unlike the redox-inactive $Zn^{2+}$ ion. This leads to the generation of damaging reactive oxygen species that inactivate the enzyme.\n\nC. The larger ionic radius of $Cd^{2+}$ results in a lower charge density compared to $Zn^{2+}$. This makes $Cd^{2+}$ a weaker Lewis acid, and thus less effective at lowering the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ of the coordinated water molecule.\n\nD. The $Cd^{2+}$ ion prefers an octahedral coordination geometry, which is incompatible with the tetrahedral coordination site provided by the three histidine residues, leading to a complete disruption of the active site structure.\n\nE. The bulkier $Cd^{2+}$ ion sterically blocks the narrow channel through which the substrate, carbon dioxide, must travel to reach the active site.", "solution": "We identify the catalytic role of the metal in carbonic anhydrase: the metal ion acts as a Lewis acid to polarize and deprotonate a coordinated water molecule, generating a bound hydroxide nucleophile at physiological pH.

For a point charge $q$ the electric field scales as\n$$\nE(r)=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\frac{q}{r^{2}},\n$$\nso, for two divalent ions with the same $q=2e$, the larger ionic radius leads to a smaller field at comparable metal–ligand distances and thus weaker polarization of the O–H bond in coordinated water. Consequently, replacing $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ with the larger $\\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ (same charge, larger radius) lowers the charge density and weakens Lewis acidity, raising the $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ of the coordinated water and decreasing the fraction of the active hydroxide at physiological pH, directly inhibiting catalysis.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is not the most direct chemical explanation; displacement by $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ or $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is neither required nor fundamental to the observed inhibition.\n- B is incorrect because $\\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$, like $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$, is a $\\mathrm{d}^{10}$ ion and is not redox-active under physiological conditions; reactive oxygen species generation is not the cause.\n- C directly states the fundamental principle: larger radius implies lower charge density, weaker Lewis acidity, and less effective $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ lowering of bound water.\n- D overstates coordination preferences; while $\\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ may more readily adopt higher coordination numbers, tetrahedral coordination by histidines and a water/hydroxide is possible, and this is not the primary reason for loss of activity.\n- E is a steric argument unrelated to the primary chemical role of the metal in acidifying water; the size difference is not expected to block substrate access.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and fundamental chemical explanation is that the larger $\\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ has a lower charge density and is a weaker Lewis acid, making it less effective at lowering the $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ of the coordinated water.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2118825"}, {"introduction": "The catalytic activity of a metal ion is not determined in isolation; it is exquisitely fine-tuned by the protein environment that surrounds it. The specific amino acid residues that coordinate the metal are crucial for positioning it and modulating its electronic properties.

The active site of wild-type Zincolysin contains a single zinc ion (Zn²⁺) that is essential for catalysis. X-ray crystallography reveals that this Zn²⁺ ion is coordinated by the side chains of three amino acid residues: His-69, His-73, and Asp-170. The fourth coordination site is occupied by a water molecule, which acts as the nucleophile in the peptide bond hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by the enzyme.\n\nTo probe the catalytic mechanism, a mutant version of Zincolysin is created using site-directed mutagenesis, where the aspartate residue at position 170 is replaced by an asparagine residue. This mutant is referred to as D170N.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected effect of the D170N mutation on the catalytic activity of Zincolysin?\n\nA. The catalytic rate will be substantially reduced because the neutral amide side chain of asparagine is a less effective ligand and cannot stabilize the positive charge of the Zn²⁺ ion as well as the negatively charged carboxylate of aspartate. This impairs the ion's ability to lower the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ of the coordinated water molecule.\n\nB. The catalytic rate will be substantially increased because the asparagine side chain is less bulky than the aspartate side chain, allowing the substrate to bind with higher affinity.\n\nC. The catalytic rate will be unaffected because both aspartate and asparagine have side chains of similar size and both contain an oxygen atom capable of coordinating the Zn²⁺ ion.\n\nD. The enzyme will be completely inactivated because the mutation prevents the Zn²⁺ ion from binding in the active site, causing the protein to unfold.\n\nE. The optimal pH for the enzyme's activity will shift to a more acidic value (lower pH) to compensate for the loss of the acidic aspartate residue.", "solution": "We identify the catalytic architecture: in the wild-type enzyme the active site houses a single $ \\mathrm{Zn^{2+}} $ coordinated by three protein ligands (His-69, His-73, Asp-170) plus a water molecule.

At fixed $ \\mathrm{pH} $, an increase in $ \\mathrm{p}K_{a}^{\\mathrm{bound}} $ decreases $ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{OH^{-}}} $, reducing the steady-state concentration of the nucleophile. Because the catalytic rate depends on the availability of the metal-bound hydroxide, one expects a substantial reduction in $ k_{\\mathrm{cat}} $ and overall catalytic activity.\n\nWe now evaluate the options in light of these principles:\n- Option A asserts that replacing Asp with Asn reduces the ability to stabilize $ \\mathrm{Zn^{2+}} $ and to lower the $ \\mathrm{p}K_{a} $ of the coordinated water, thereby lowering the catalytic rate. This matches the analysis above.\n- Option B invokes reduced steric bulk to increase activity. However, the dominant effect here is electrostatics and metal coordination strength, not sterics; reduced bulk does not compensate for the loss of an anionic ligand and would not be expected to increase activity.\n- Option C claims no effect because both have oxygen donors. This ignores the crucial difference between an anionic carboxylate and a neutral amide; the effect will not be negligible.\n- Option D predicts complete inactivation and unfolding due to loss of $ \\mathrm{Zn^{2+}} $ binding.
