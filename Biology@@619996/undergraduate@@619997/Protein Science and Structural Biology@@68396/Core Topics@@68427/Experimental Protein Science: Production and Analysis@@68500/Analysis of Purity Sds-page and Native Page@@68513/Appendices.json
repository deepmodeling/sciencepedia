However, achieving clear separation, or resolution, requires careful tuning of the experimental conditions. This practice challenges you to apply your understanding of the gel matrix to a common laboratory problem: choosing the optimal acrylamide concentration to distinguish between two large proteins with only a small difference in mass [@problem_id:2099095].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a novel dimeric enzyme, \"Chaperonin-Y\". Preliminary analysis by mass spectrometry indicated that the monomeric subunit of Chaperonin-Y has a molecular weight of approximately 80 kDa. To characterize its quaternary structure, the biochemist performs Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). When the purified protein is run on an SDS-PAGE gel without any reducing agent, a single band is observed at a position corresponding to 160 kDa. When a reducing agent, beta-mercaptoethanol (BME), is added to the sample before loading, the gel shows a single band at 80 kDa.\n\nThe biochemist then receives a sample from a collaborator that is a mixture of wild-type Chaperonin-Y and a mutant variant. The mutation is a small insertion that increases the molecular weight of the monomeric subunit to 85 kDa, but it does not affect the protein's ability to form a disulfide-linked dimer. The goal is to visually confirm the presence of both the wild-type (160 kDa dimer) and mutant (170 kDa dimer) in the mixture.\n\nWhich of the following experimental setups would provide the best resolution to distinguish between the 160 kDa wild-type dimer and the 170 kDa mutant dimer?\n\nA. A 12% SDS-PAGE gel, because the smaller pores provide a stronger sieving effect, which is necessary to distinguish proteins with a small mass difference.\n\nB. A 15% Native PAGE gel, because it preserves the native protein shape and the high gel density is required to resolve large complexes.\n\nC. A 6% SDS-PAGE gel, because the larger pores will allow both large proteins to migrate a sufficient distance into the gel, enabling their separation based on the difference in mass.\n\nD. A 6% Native PAGE gel, because it is the standard method for analyzing large native protein complexes, and the low density is appropriate for this size range.\n\nE. It is not possible to resolve these two proteins using PAGE, as the 10 kDa difference is less than 10% of the total mass, which is below the typical resolution limit of the technique.", "solution": "We want to distinguish two disulfide-linked dimers at approximately 160 kDa (wild-type) and 170 kDa (mutant). Because the dimers are disulfide-linked, the appropriate electrophoretic mode to resolve them by mass is non-reducing SDS-PAGE, where Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate binds to polypeptides and renders the charge-to-mass ratio approximately constant. Under SDS-PAGE, migration depends primarily on the hydrodynamic size (and thus molecular mass) in a sieving gel matrix.\n\nKey physical principles for SDS-PAGE:\n- In the presence of SDS, protein mobility depends primarily on size because SDS confers a roughly uniform charge density. The electrophoretic mobility is $\\mu = v/E$, and under sieving conditions the observed migration distance $d$ at a fixed acrylamide concentration is empirically linear with $\\ln M$:\n$$\nd = a - b \\ln M,\n$$\nwith $a$ and $b$ constants for a given gel composition and running condition. Hence, the separation between two proteins with masses $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ is\n$$\n\\Delta d = b \\left|\\ln\\left(\\frac{M_{2}}{M_{1}}\\right)\\right|.\n$$\n- The gel acrylamide concentration controls pore size. Lower acrylamide fraction (e.g., 6%) gives larger pores, allowing high-mass proteins to enter and migrate a longer distance. This increases the available path length and practical resolution for large proteins. Higher acrylamide fraction (e.g., 12% to 15%) yields smaller pores that impede large proteins, causing them to remain near the top of the gel with compressed, poorly resolved bands.\n\nApply these principles to the options:\n- For the target masses $M_{1} = 160$ and $M_{2} = 170$, the mass ratio is $M_{2}/M_{1} = 17/16$, and\n$$\n\\Delta d = b \\ln\\left(\\frac{17}{16}\\right).\n$$\nTo maximize the observable $\\Delta d$ on the gel, one must allow these large proteins to migrate sufficiently far into the matrix; this is best accomplished by using a low acrylamide fraction in SDS-PAGE. A higher fraction like 12% reduces pore size and compresses large proteins near the well, decreasing the effective $d$ and rendering $\\Delta d$ difficult to resolve. Thus:\n- Option A (12% SDS-PAGE) is suboptimal for 160 to 170 kDa because the pores are too small for good separation at high mass.\n- Option B (15% Native PAGE) is inappropriate because native PAGE preserves charge and shape, making mobility depend on conformation and net charge rather than primarily on mass; additionally, 15% is too dense for such large complexes, likely preventing adequate entry and separation.\n- Option C (6% SDS-PAGE) provides large pores so that both 160 and 170 kDa species migrate sufficiently into the gel under denaturing, uniform charge conditions, maximizing practical resolution of a small mass difference at high mass.\n- Option D (6% Native PAGE) is inferior to SDS-PAGE for resolving a small mass difference because native conditions confound mass-based separation with shape and charge effects.\n- Option E is incorrect; PAGE can resolve a 10 kDa difference at this mass range when using an appropriate low-percentage SDS-PAGE gel (and gradient SDS-PAGE would improve resolution further, though not listed).\n\nTherefore, the best choice is a low-percentage SDS-PAGE gel to separate 160 kDa from 170 kDa under non-reducing conditions, which corresponds to Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2099095"}, {"introduction": "While SDS-PAGE is excellent for estimating molecular weight, it's crucial to remember that migration distance is a proxy for size, not a direct measurement of mass. This exercise presents a common yet puzzling scenario where a protein's apparent molecular weight on a gel differs from its true mass confirmed by another method [@problem_id:2099130]. By working through this discrepancy, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the underlying assumptions of SDS-PAGE and the factors that can lead to anomalous migration.", "problem": "A research team is studying a newly discovered protein named \"Kinase Associated Protein 60\" (KAP60). The theoretical molecular weight of the full-length KAP60 polypeptide, calculated from its gene sequence, is 60.0 kDa.\n\nTo characterize the protein, the team purifies KAP60 and performs two separate analyses. First, they run the purified protein on a Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel under reducing conditions. On this gel, KAP60 migrates as a single, sharp band with an apparent molecular weight of 50.0 kDa, as determined by comparison to a standard protein ladder.\n\nPuzzled by this result, the team then analyzes an aliquot of the same purified sample using high-resolution mass spectrometry. This analysis confirms that the actual molecular mass of the protein present in the sample is indeed 60.0 kDa.\n\nGiven these experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most plausible explanation for the discrepancy between the apparent molecular weight on the SDS-PAGE gel and the actual molecular mass?\n\nA. A 10.0 kDa fragment is proteolytically cleaved from KAP60 after translation, and this mature form was the one analyzed.\n\nB. KAP60 is a highly flexible protein that fails to adopt a stable structure, causing it to bind more SDS per unit mass than typical proteins.\n\nC. KAP60 in its native state exists as a stable, non-covalent homodimer with a total mass of 120.0 kDa.\n\nD. KAP60 is heavily glycosylated, and the attached carbohydrate chains alter its electrophoretic mobility.\n\nE. KAP60 possesses an unusually high proportion of acidic amino acid residues (aspartate and glutamate), leading to a greater intrinsic negative charge.", "solution": "We are given:\n- Theoretical molecular weight from gene sequence: $M_{\\text{theory}} = 60.0$ kDa.\n- SDS-PAGE (reducing) shows a single band with apparent molecular weight $M_{\\text{app}} = 50.0$ kDa.\n- High-resolution mass spectrometry confirms actual molecular mass $M_{\\text{true}} = 60.0$ kDa for the purified protein.\n\nKey principle of SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions:\n- SDS binds to polypeptides approximately uniformly by mass, yielding an approximately constant negative charge-to-mass ratio, so that electrophoretic mobility primarily reflects molecular size. Let $q$ denote the net charge on the SDSâ€“protein complex and $f$ the frictional coefficient in the gel. The electrophoretic mobility is $\\mu = \\frac{q}{f}$. Under ideal SDS binding, $q$ is proportional to mass and $f$ scales with size, producing a roughly linear relationship between migration distance and $\\log(M)$ for typical proteins. Deviations occur if SDS binding per unit mass or the effective charge or friction deviates from the typical values due to sequence or post-translational features.\n\nWe compare each option against the data and the above principle:\n\nA. If a $10.0$ kDa fragment were proteolytically cleaved post-translationally, the mature product analyzed would have $M \\approx 50.0$ kDa. This contradicts the mass spectrometry result $M_{\\text{true}} = 60.0$ kDa on the same purified sample. Therefore A is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry and is rejected.\n\nB. Claim: a highly flexible protein binds more SDS per unit mass than typical, leading to faster migration. Empirically, intrinsically disordered or highly flexible proteins often have atypical amino acid compositions (enriched in charged, depleted in hydrophobic residues) and tend to bind less SDS per unit mass and migrate anomalously slowly on SDS-PAGE, appearing heavier, i.e., $M_{\\text{app}} > M_{\\text{true}}$, not $M_{\\text{app}}  M_{\\text{true}}$. Thus this mechanism predicts the opposite trend and is not a plausible explanation here.\n\nC. A non-covalent homodimer of total mass $120.0$ kDa in native conditions is irrelevant under SDS-PAGE with reducing agents: SDS denatures and the reducing agent breaks disulfides, so non-covalent dimers dissociate, yielding monomers that migrate according to monomer properties. This does not explain why a $60.0$ kDa monomer would appear at $50.0$ kDa. Therefore C does not resolve the discrepancy.\n\nD. Heavy glycosylation increases mass and typically decreases SDS binding per unit mass (carbohydrates do not bind SDS), reducing $|q|$ per mass and increasing $f$ relative to charge. This yields decreased mobility, so $M_{\\text{app}}$ tends to be larger than $M_{\\text{true}}$. The observation is the opposite ($M_{\\text{app}}  M_{\\text{true}}$), and mass spectrometry confirms $60.0$ kDa without extra mass. Therefore D is implausible.\n\nE. An unusually high proportion of acidic residues increases the intrinsic negative charge of the polypeptide. Although SDS largely standardizes the charge-to-mass ratio, extreme amino acid compositions can cause anomalous migration. If the intrinsic negative charge adds to the SDS-derived negative charges, the magnitude of $q$ per unit mass can be greater than typical, while $f$ remains similar, increasing $\\mu = \\frac{q}{f}$. On a gel calibrated with typical proteins, this higher mobility will be interpreted as a smaller apparent molecular weight, i.e., $M_{\\text{app}}  M_{\\text{true}}$. This explains why SDS-PAGE reports $50.0$ kDa while mass spectrometry, which directly measures mass, confirms $60.0$ kDa. Therefore E provides the most plausible explanation among the options.\n\nConclusion: The discrepancy arises from anomalous SDS-PAGE migration caused by unusual amino acid composition (high acidity), which increases mobility and yields an underestimated apparent molecular weight, while mass spectrometry correctly reports the true mass.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2099130"}, {"introduction": "The true power of electrophoresis is revealed when different PAGE techniques are used in concert to unravel the complex architecture of multi-subunit proteins.

To determine its quaternary structure, they perform a series of gel electrophoresis experiments. The results are as follows:\n\n1.  **Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE):** When the purified, active enzyme is run on a native gel, which preserves the protein's folded state and non-covalent subunit interactions, it migrates as a single distinct band with an apparent molecular weight of 180 kDa.\n\n2.  **Non-reducing Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE):** The enzyme is first treated with the detergent SDS to denature it but not with a reducing agent. This process dissociates non-covalently linked subunits. Electrophoresis then reveals two distinct bands with apparent molecular weights of 110 kDa and 70 kDa.\n\n3.  **Reducing SDS-PAGE:** The enzyme is treated with both SDS and a reducing agent (e.g., Î²-mercaptoethanol), which breaks all disulfide bonds in addition to disrupting non-covalent interactions. This experiment reveals the fundamental polypeptide chains of the complex. Two bands are observed, with apparent molecular weights of 70 kDa and 40 kDa.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, you should assume that for all SDS-PAGE experiments, the protein subunits are fully denatured and their electrophoretic mobility provides an accurate measure of their polypeptide mass. Let the fundamental polypeptide chain with a mass of 70 kDa be denoted as the Î±-subunit, and the chain with a mass of 40 kDa be denoted as the Î²-subunit.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following options correctly describes the subunit stoichiometry and linkage pattern of the native Quatro-Synthase enzyme?\n\nA. The enzyme is a heterotrimer with an Î±â‚‚Î² stoichiometry. One Î±-subunit is covalently linked to the Î²-subunit via a disulfide bond, and this Î±-Î² heterodimer associates non-covalently with the second Î±-subunit.\n\nB.

Within each heterodimer, the subunits are also linked by a disulfide bond.\n\nD. The enzyme is a heterotrimer with an Î±Î²â‚‚ stoichiometry. The Î±-subunit is covalently linked to one Î²-subunit via a disulfide bond, and this dimer associates non-covalently with the second Î²-subunit.\n\nE. The enzyme is a simple heterodimer of two polypeptide chains with masses of 110 kDa and 70 kDa. The 110 kDa chain possesses an internal disulfide bond that, upon reduction, causes a major change in its tertiary structure, leading it to migrate with an apparent mass of 40 kDa.", "solution": "Define the fundamental polypeptide masses from reducing SDS-PAGE: the enzyme contains two distinct chains, an $\\alpha$ of mass $70$ and a $\\beta$ of mass $40$. Let $a$ be the number of $\\alpha$ subunits and $b$ be the number of $\\beta$ subunits in the native complex.\n\nFrom native PAGE, the intact complex migrates at $180$. Assuming additivity of subunit masses, the total mass satisfies\n$$\n70a + 40b = 180.\n$$\nDivide by $10$ to simplify:\n$$\n7a + 4b = 18.\n$$\nSeek nonnegative integer solutions. Testing $a=0,1,2,3$:\n- $a=0 \\Rightarrow 4b=18$ is impossible.\n- $a=1 \\Rightarrow 7+4b=18 \\Rightarrow 4b=11$ is impossible.\n- $a=2 \\Rightarrow 14+4b=18 \\Rightarrow 4b=4 \\Rightarrow b=1$ is valid.\n- $a\\geq 3$ yields $7a \\geq 21 > 18$, impossible.\n\nThus the unique feasible stoichiometry is $\\alpha_{2}\\beta_{1}$.\n\nNext, interpret the non-reducing SDS-PAGE result: bands at $110$ and $70$. In SDS (non-reducing), non-covalent interactions are disrupted while disulfide bonds remain. Therefore, any species migrating at $110$ must be a disulfide-linked covalent unit whose mass equals the sum of its polypeptide constituents. Given the fundamental polypeptides are $70$ ($\\alpha$) and $40$ ($\\beta$), the only way to obtain $110$ is a disulfide-linked $\\alpha\\beta$ pair since $70+40=110$. The remaining $70$ band corresponds to the second $\\alpha$ subunit, which is not disulfide-linked and therefore runs as a monomer in non-reducing SDS-PAGE. These two species together account for the native mass because $110+70=180$.\n\nTherefore, the native complex is a heterotrimer with $\\alpha_{2}\\beta$ stoichiometry in which one $\\alpha$ is covalently linked to the $\\beta$ via a disulfide bond, and this $\\alpha\\text{-}\\beta$ heterodimer associates non-covalently with the second $\\alpha$.\n\nCheck each option against these deductions:\n- A matches exactly: $\\alpha_{2}\\beta$ with one $\\alpha$ disulfide-linked to $\\beta$ (110) plus a non-covalently associated $\\alpha$ (70).\n- B would give a disulfide-linked $\\alpha\\alpha$ at $140$ and a free $\\beta$ at $40$ in non-reducing SDS-PAGE, contradicting the observed $110$ and $70$.\n- C implies $\\alpha_{2}\\beta_{2}$ with total mass $2(70+40)=220$, contradicting the native $180$.\n- D implies $\\alpha\\beta_{2}$ with total mass $70+2\\cdot 40=150$, contradicting the native $180$, and would yield $110$ and $40$ in non-reducing SDS-PAGE, not $110$ and $70$.\n- E contradicts the principle that reducing an internal disulfide does not change polypeptide chain length; moreover, reducing SDS-PAGE revealed distinct $70$ and $40$ chains, not a $110$ chain converting to $40$.\n\nThus, the correct description is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2099148"}]}
