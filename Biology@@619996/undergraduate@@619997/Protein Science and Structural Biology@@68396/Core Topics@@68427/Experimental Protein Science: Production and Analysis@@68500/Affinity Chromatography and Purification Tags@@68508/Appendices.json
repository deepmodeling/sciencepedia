The fusion protein carries an N-terminal Maltose-Binding Protein (MBP) tag. MBP specifically binds maltose and related maltodextrins with high affinity. In commonly used affinity purification systems, the solid support matrix is functionalized with a ligand that mimics MBP’s natural substrate.\n\nThe standard resin for MBP-tag purification presents amylose, which is a linear polymer of glucose residues linked by alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds and effectively serves as a high-affinity ligand for MBP due to its maltodextrin-like structure. Therefore, an amylose resin specifically captures MBP-fusion proteins and allows their elution with maltose.\n\nWe eliminate distractors by matching each to its canonical tag:\n- Glutathione is the ligand for GST-tagged proteins, not MBP.\n- Nickel chelates (e.g., Ni-NTA) capture His-tagged proteins, not MBP.\n- Glucose is not used as a ligand for MBP purification; MBP requires maltose/maltodextrin-like ligands with higher affinity.\n- Lactose binds galactose-binding proteins and is not standard for MBP purification.\n\nThus, the molecule that should be covalently attached to the resin is amylose.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2097105"}, {"introduction": "Once you have eluted your protein, the next step is to assess its purity, a task commonly performed using Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This practice challenges you to think critically about the information an SDS-PAGE gel can provide. By analyzing a hypothetical result showing a single, correctly sized band, you will learn to draw scientifically sound conclusions while recognizing the limitations of this technique regarding the protein's native structure and function [@problem_id:2097161].", "problem": "A biochemistry student is working to purify a hypothetical enzyme called \"Glucovorin,\" which they have successfully expressed in an *Escherichia coli* host system. The gene sequence for Glucovorin predicts a molecular weight of 48 kilodaltons (kDa). For purification, the Glucovorin protein was engineered to include a C-terminal hexahistidine-tag (His-tag), which is a short peptide sequence that adds an additional mass of approximately 1 kDa to the total protein size.\n\nThe student performs a purification using Nickel-Nitriloacetic Acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography, which specifically binds proteins containing a His-tag. After collecting and concentrating the final fraction eluted from the chromatography column, the student analyzes its contents using Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a technique that separates proteins primarily based on their molecular weight after denaturing them.\n\nUpon staining the gel with Coomassie blue, the student observes the lane corresponding to their purified sample. The lane shows a single, strong, distinct band at an apparent molecular weight of approximately 49 kDa. No other bands are visible.\n\nBased *solely* on this SDS-PAGE result, which of the following statements represents the most scientifically sound and cautious conclusion?\n\nA. The purification was completely successful, and the eluate contains 100% pure, correctly folded, and functionally active Glucovorin.\n\nB. The purification has likely isolated a polypeptide of the expected molecular weight for His-tagged Glucovorin, but this result alone does not confirm the protein's native three-dimensional structure or its enzymatic activity.\n\nC. The eluted sample contains the target protein, but it is heavily contaminated with native *E. coli* proteins that coincidentally also have a molecular weight of 49 kDa.\n\nD. The protein in the elution tube is now permanently denatured and non-functional because a sample of it was treated with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate for the gel analysis.\n\nE. The single band on the gel proves that the native, functional Glucovorin enzyme exists as a monomer and does not form dimers or other higher-order oligomers.", "solution": "We begin by computing the expected apparent molecular weight of the engineered protein. The predicted mass of Glucovorin from its gene sequence is $48$ kDa, and the engineered C-terminal hexahistidine tag contributes approximately $1$ kDa. Therefore,\n$$\nM_{\\text{expected}} = 48 \\text{ kDa} + 1 \\text{ kDa} = 49 \\text{ kDa}.\n$$\nNi-NTA affinity chromatography selectively retains His-tagged proteins, so the eluate is expected to be enriched for His-tagged species. SDS-PAGE separates polypeptides by apparent molecular mass under denaturing conditions due to the binding of sodium dodecyl sulfate, which unfolds proteins and imposes a near-uniform charge-to-mass ratio. Coomassie blue staining visualizes the polypeptide bands but does not report on protein folding or catalytic function.\n\nThe observation of a single, strong, distinct band at approximately $49$ kDa indicates that the major species in the purified fraction has an apparent molecular mass matching $M_{\\text{expected}}$ for His-tagged Glucovorin. This is consistent with successful enrichment of the intended polypeptide.\n\nHowever, several limitations apply:\n- SDS-PAGE is denaturing and does not assess native three-dimensional structure or enzymatic activity; thus, folding state and function remain untested and cannot be inferred from this gel alone.\n- A single Coomassie-stained band does not prove absolute purity; low-abundance contaminants, co-migrating proteins of similar mass, or species below the detection limit might still be present. Additional orthogonal purity assessments (e.g., mass spectrometry, analytical size-exclusion chromatography, activity assays) would be required to establish purity and function.\n- Denaturing SDS-PAGE cannot reveal the native oligomeric state; a monomeric band on SDS-PAGE provides no evidence about whether the protein oligomerizes under native conditions.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is not justified because SDS-PAGE alone cannot establish $100$ percent purity, correct folding, or enzymatic activity; functional assays and biophysical characterization are required.\n- B accurately states that the isolated polypeptide is of the expected mass for His-tagged Glucovorin and appropriately cautions that this alone does not confirm native structure or activity. This aligns with the principles above.\n- C claims heavy contamination with native host proteins of the same mass, which is not supported by the single distinct band and the specificity of Ni-NTA; while minor contaminants cannot be excluded, “heavily contaminated” is not evidenced.\n- D is incorrect because only the aliquot loaded onto the gel is exposed to SDS, and SDS exposure in the gel sample does not imply that the remaining eluted protein is permanently denatured or non-functional.\n- E is incorrect because SDS-PAGE is denaturing and cannot be used to conclude anything about native oligomeric state.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically sound and cautious conclusion is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2097161"}, {"introduction": "In practice, initial purification attempts often yield a target protein that is contaminated with other cellular proteins. This final exercise simulates a common troubleshooting scenario where your eluted sample is impure. You will learn to diagnose the likely cause of the contamination and evaluate different strategies to optimize the protocol, focusing on how to modify the wash step to remove non-specifically bound proteins and achieve higher purity [@problem_id:2097102].", "problem": "A student in an introductory biochemistry lab is attempting to purify a recombinant enzyme called \"hexokinase-H6\" from a crude *E. coli* cell lysate. The enzyme has been engineered to include a polyhistidine tag (His-tag) on its C-terminus, which allows for purification using Nickel-Nitrilotriacetic Acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography. The principle of this technique is that the His-tag binds with high affinity to the nickel ions immobilized on the chromatography resin.\n\nThe standard protocol involves three main steps:\n1.  **Loading:** The crude cell lysate is passed through the Ni-NTA column, allowing the His-tagged hexokinase-H6 to bind to the resin.\n2.  **Washing:** A wash buffer is passed through the column to remove proteins from the lysate that are unbound or have bound non-specifically (_i.e._, with low affinity) to the resin.\n3.  **Elution:** An elution buffer, containing a high concentration of imidazole, is used to release the hexokinase-H6 from the resin. Imidazole's chemical structure is similar to the side chain of histidine and it competes with the His-tag for binding to the nickel ions.\n\nAfter performing the purification, the student analyzes the collected elution fraction using Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gel shows a strong band at the correct molecular weight for hexokinase-H6, but it is accompanied by a significant number of other fainter protein bands, indicating substantial contamination.\n\nTo improve the purity of the hexokinase-H6 in the final eluted sample, which of the following single modifications to the chromatography protocol represents the most logical and effective first step to implement?\n\nA. Decrease the concentration of imidazole in the elution buffer.\n\nB. Increase the stringency of the wash step by including a low concentration of imidazole in the wash buffer.\n\nC. Decrease the flow rate during the loading of the crude lysate onto the column to maximize binding time.\n\nD. Immediately repeat the entire chromatography procedure on the already eluted sample a second time.\n\nE. Switch to a different expression host, such as yeast, as *E. coli* is known to have many histidine-rich proteins.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most effective initial step to optimize an affinity chromatography protocol that is yielding an impure protein sample. The presence of numerous contaminating bands in the elution fraction, as observed on the SDS-PAGE gel, indicates that proteins other than the target His-tagged hexokinase-H6 are binding to the Ni-NTA resin and remaining bound until the final elution step. The goal is to remove these non-specifically bound proteins before eluting the target protein.\n\nLet's analyze the function of each step and evaluate the proposed modifications:\n\n1.  **The Core Problem:** The contaminants are proteins that bind weakly or non-specifically to the Ni-NTA resin. The wash step is specifically designed to remove such proteins. The fact that they appear in the elution fraction means the wash step was not stringent enough to remove them.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Option A (Decrease elution imidazole):** The elution buffer uses a high concentration of imidazole to out-compete the His-tag and release the target protein. Decreasing the imidazole concentration would make the elution less efficient. While this might prevent some very weakly bound contaminants from eluting, it would also likely reduce the recovery (yield) of the desired hexokinase-H6. It doesn't address the root cause, which is that the contaminants are on the column in the first place.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Option B (Increase wash stringency):** This is the most direct solution to the problem. The wash step's purpose is to remove non-specifically bound proteins. By adding a low, carefully chosen concentration of imidazole (e.g., 20-50 mM) to the wash buffer, a competitive pressure is introduced. This concentration is high enough to displace proteins that are weakly bound to the resin (the contaminants) but too low to displace the target protein, which is strongly bound via its high-affinity His-tag. This makes the wash more \"stringent\" and is the standard first-line strategy for improving purity in His-tag affinity chromatography.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Option C (Decrease loading flow rate):** Decreasing the flow rate increases the residence time of the lysate on the column. This would generally improve the binding efficiency of the target protein, potentially increasing yield. However, it would also give the contaminating proteins more time to bind non-specifically. Therefore, this change is unlikely to improve purity and might even worsen it.\n\n5.  **Analysis of Option D (Repeat chromatography):** Running the eluted sample through a second, identical chromatography procedure is a valid strategy for increasing purity, sometimes called \"polishing.\" However, it is not the most effective *first* step. It is better to optimize the single-pass protocol first to make it as efficient as possible. If the first pass is fundamentally flawed (e.g., has a non-stringent wash), the second pass will also be suboptimal and lead to unnecessary loss of protein yield. Optimizing the initial protocol (as in option B) is more efficient and addresses the problem at its source.\n\n6.  **Analysis of Option E (Switch expression host):** This is a drastic, time-consuming, and expensive change. While it is true that different organisms have different protein profiles, it is far from the *first logical step*. It is a last-resort option to be considered only after exhausting all possibilities for optimizing the existing purification protocol. Simple modifications to buffer composition are much easier and faster to test.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of contaminants in the eluate points directly to an insufficiently stringent wash step. The most effective and logical first step to improve purity is to enhance the ability of the wash step to remove these non-specifically bound proteins. This is achieved by adding a competitive agent, like a low concentration of imidazole, to the wash buffer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2097102"}]}
