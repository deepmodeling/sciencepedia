The first step of their purification scheme involves fractionating a homogenate of eukaryotic cells using differential centrifugation. The standard procedure to obtain a crude nuclear fraction is to centrifuge the initial cell lysate at 1,000 x g for 10 minutes. This low-speed spin is designed to pellet the nuclei while leaving smaller organelles in the supernatant.\n\nHowever, the student accidentally sets the refrigerated ultracentrifuge to 100,000 x g for 60 minutes. Assuming the initial homogenate was prepared correctly and contained all subcellular components, which of the following groups of organelles and structures would be most comprehensively found in the resulting pellet, in addition to the desired nuclei?\n\nFor reference, here are the typical conditions required to pellet major subcellular fractions from a supernatant *after* the preceding fraction has been removed:\n- **Nuclei and cytoskeleton:** 1,000 x g for 10 minutes\n- **Mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes:** 20,000 x g for 20 minutes\n- **Microsomes (fragments of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus):** 80,000 x g for 60 minutes\n- **Ribosomes:** 150,000 x g for 180 minutes\n\nA.

For a fixed tube length, whether a component pellets depends on the product of field strength and time; higher relative centrifugal force and longer time pellet progressively smaller particles. Therefore, if the applied $g$ and time exceed the typical threshold conditions for a given component, that component will pellet from a crude homogenate; any components that pellet under milder conditions will also pellet when stronger conditions are applied.\n\n2) Compare the student’s setting ($100{,}000 \\times g$ for $60$ minutes) to standard thresholds:\n- Nuclei (and cytoskeleton) require $1{,}000 \\times g$ for $10$ minutes. Since $100{,}000 \\times g$ for $60$ minutes is far greater in both force and time, nuclei will pellet.\n- Mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes require $20{,}000 \\times g$ for $20$ minutes. The student’s conditions are stronger and longer, so these will pellet.\n- Microsomes (ER/Golgi fragments) require $80{,}000 \\times g$ for $60$ minutes. The student used $100{,}000 \\times g$ for $60$ minutes, which meets and exceeds this threshold, so microsomes will pellet.\n- Ribosomes require $150{,}000 \\times g$ for $180$ minutes. The student used a lower force and shorter time ($100{,}000 \\times g$ for $60$ minutes), which does not meet this threshold; thus ribosomes would not be comprehensively pelleted.\n\n3) Conclusion: Applying $100{,}000 \\times g$ for $60$ minutes to the initial homogenate would pellet nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and microsomes, but not ribosomes.
