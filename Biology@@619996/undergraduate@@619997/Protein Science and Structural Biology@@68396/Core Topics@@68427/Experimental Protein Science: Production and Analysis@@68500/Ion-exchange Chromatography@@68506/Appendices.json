By predicting the outcome, you will solidify your understanding of ionic competition and the importance of each step in the chromatography workflow.", "problem": "A biochemist is attempting to purify a target protein, designated Protein B, from a crude cellular extract containing two other major contaminants, Protein A and Protein C. The isoelectric points (pI) of these proteins are known: Protein A (pI = 6.0), Protein B (pI = 7.5), and Protein C (pI = 9.0).\n\nThe purification strategy involves anion-exchange chromatography using a column packed with Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose. The standard protocol requires equilibrating the column with a starting buffer at pH 8.0 containing a negligible salt concentration, loading the protein mixture (also in the starting buffer), and then eluting the bound proteins with a linear gradient of sodium chloride (NaCl) from 0 M to 1.0 M, all at pH 8.0.\n\nHowever, a critical error is made. After regenerating the column with a high-salt buffer (1.0 M NaCl, pH 8.0), the researcher forgets to perform the equilibration step with the low-salt starting buffer. Instead, they proceed to load the protein mixture directly onto the column, which is still saturated with the 1.0 M NaCl regeneration buffer. The eluate is monitored continuously by measuring its absorbance at 280 nm.\n\nWhich of the following options best describes the resulting chromatogram showing absorbance versus elution volume?\n\nA.

A single peak containing Protein C will appear in the flow-through, while Proteins A and B will be irreversibly denatured and precipitated on the column by the high salt, resulting in no further eluted peaks.\n\nE. Two distinct peaks will be observed in the initial flow-through. The first peak will contain Protein C, and the second peak will contain both Proteins A and B. No proteins will be eluted during the salt gradient.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the outcome of an anion-exchange chromatography experiment where a critical procedural error was made. To solve this, we must analyze the principles of anion-exchange chromatography and the effect of the high salt concentration present during sample loading.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the charge of the column and proteins at the operating pH.**\nThe chromatography is performed at a buffer pH of 8.0. The stationary phase is Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose, which is a weak anion exchanger. Its functional group is an amine, which is protonated and thus positively charged at pH values below its pKa (which is around 9.5). Therefore, at pH 8.0, the DEAE-cellulose matrix is positively charged.\n\nNext, we determine the net charge of each protein at pH 8.0 by comparing the pH to their isoelectric points (pI). A protein is negatively charged if the pH is above its pI, positively charged if the pH is below its pI, and has no net charge at its pI.\n\n- **Protein A (pI = 6.0):** At pH 8.0, pH > pI, so Protein A has a net negative charge.\n- **Protein B (pI = 7.5):** At pH 8.0, pH > pI, so Protein B has a net negative charge.\n- **Protein C (pI = 9.0):** At pH 8.0, pH < pI, so Protein C has a net positive charge.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the intended (correct) separation principle.**\nIn a standard anion-exchange protocol, the column is equilibrated with a low-salt buffer. Upon loading the sample, the negatively charged proteins (A and B) would bind to the positively charged DEAE matrix due to electrostatic attraction. The positively charged protein (C) would be repelled by the matrix and would not bind, passing straight through the column in the initial buffer volume, known as the flow-through or void volume. Subsequently, a gradient of increasing salt concentration (NaCl) would be applied. The chloride anions ($Cl^-$) from the salt would compete with the bound proteins for the positive sites on the resin. As the $Cl^-$ concentration increases, it would first displace the weakly bound protein, and then the more strongly bound protein, leading to their separation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the effect of the procedural error.**\nThe error is that the sample is loaded onto a column that is still saturated with the high-salt regeneration buffer (1.0 M NaCl). This means that the mobile phase surrounding the DEAE-cellulose beads has a very high ionic strength from the moment the proteins are introduced.\n\nThe fundamental principle of elution in ion-exchange chromatography is competition. In this case, the mobile phase is flooded with a very high concentration of small, mobile anions ($Cl^-$ from 1.0 M NaCl). These $Cl^-$ ions will effectively occupy or shield the positively charged binding sites on the DEAE resin.\n\nWhen the protein mixture is loaded, here is what happens to each protein:\n- **Protein C:** Being positively charged, it would be electrostatically repelled from the positive DEAE matrix anyway. It will not bind and will pass through the column in the flow-through.\n- **Proteins A and B:** Although these proteins are negatively charged and have an affinity for the DEAE matrix, they cannot bind. The overwhelming concentration of $Cl^-$ ions in the buffer outcompetes the protein molecules for access to the positively charged sites on the resin. The electrostatic interactions between the proteins and the resin are effectively screened by the high salt concentration. Consequently, Proteins A and B are unable to displace the $Cl^-$ ions and bind to the column. They will also pass directly through the column, along with the non-binding Protein C.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the resulting chromatogram.**\nSince none of the three proteins (A, B, or C) bind to the column matrix under these high-salt conditions, they all travel with the mobile phase at roughly the same rate and emerge from the column together in the void volume. A UV detector monitoring the eluate at 280 nm (which detects proteins) will register a single, large, unresolved peak as this mixture of all three proteins exits the column.\n\nAfter this initial peak, the column is essentially empty of the loaded protein. Applying a salt gradient from 0 M to 1.0 M (or any other gradient) would be pointless, as there are no bound proteins to elute. Therefore, no subsequent peaks will be observed.\n\n**Step 5: Match the prediction to the given options.**\n- Option A is incorrect because it describes the outcome of a *successful* separation, where A and B bind and C does not.\n- Option B is incorrect. High salt *prevents* binding, it does not cause it.\n- Option C accurately describes the predicted outcome: a single, large, unresolved peak containing all three proteins in the flow-through, with no subsequent peaks.\n- Option D is incorrect. While extremely high salt can cause some proteins to precipitate (\"salting out\"), the primary effect in chromatography is the prevention of binding due to ionic competition. There is no information to suggest irreversible denaturation, and the most direct consequence is that the proteins simply do not bind.\n- Option E is incorrect because all unbound components will elute together in the void volume, not as separate peaks. Separation does not occur in the flow-through based on charge in this context.\n\nThus, the correct description of the chromatogram is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2115719"}]}
