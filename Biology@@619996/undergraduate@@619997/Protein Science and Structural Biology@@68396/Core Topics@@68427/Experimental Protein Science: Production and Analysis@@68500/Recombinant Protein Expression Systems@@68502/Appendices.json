The plasmid vector carries the gene for the protein of interest as well as a gene that provides resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin. The transformation process, which introduces the plasmid into the bacterial cells, is not perfectly efficient. Immediately after transformation and before any growth, it is determined that only 0.100% of the bacterial cells in the population have successfully taken up the plasmid.\n\nThe student uses this mixed population to inoculate a large batch of liquid growth medium. In a crucial error, the student forgets to add ampicillin to the medium. This oversight means there is no selective pressure to favor the growth of plasmid-containing cells. The culture is left to grow for a total duration of $T = 12.0$ hours.\n\nThe metabolic load of replicating the plasmid and expressing the foreign protein slows the growth of the host cells. Assume that cells without the plasmid have a doubling time of $t_{-} = 20.0$ minutes, while cells that contain the plasmid have a doubling time of $t_{+} = 25.0$ minutes. Both cell populations exhibit continuous exponential growth.\n\nCalculate the fraction of the total cell population that contains the expression plasmid at the end of the 12.0-hour growth period. Express your final answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the final fraction of plasmid-containing cells in a mixed culture where there is no antibiotic selection. We need to model the exponential growth of two distinct populations: those with the plasmid ($N_{+}$) and those without ($N_{-}$).\n\nFirst, let's establish the initial conditions. Let $N_{0}$ be the total initial number of cells. The problem states that 0.100% of the cells initially contain the plasmid.\nThe initial number of plasmid-containing cells is $N_{+,0} = 0.00100 \\cdot N_{0}$.\nThe initial number of cells without the plasmid is $N_{-,0} = (1 - 0.00100) \\cdot N_{0} = 0.999 \\cdot N_{0}$.\n\nThe formula for exponential growth based on doubling time $t_d$ is $N(t) = N_{initial} \\cdot 2^{t/t_d}$.\n\nLet's convert the total growth time $T$ from hours to minutes:\n$T = 12.0 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \\text{ minutes}$.\n\nNow, we can write the expressions for the number of cells in each population after time $T$:\nFor the plasmid-containing cells, with doubling time $t_{+} = 25.0$ minutes:\n$$N_{+}(T) = N_{+,0} \\cdot 2^{T/t_{+}} = (0.00100 \\cdot N_{0}) \\cdot 2^{720/25.0}$$\n\nFor the cells without the plasmid, with doubling time $t_{-} = 20.0$ minutes:\n$$N_{-}(T) = N_{-,0} \\cdot 2^{T/t_{-}} = (0.999 \\cdot N_{0}) \\cdot 2^{720/20.0}$$\n\nLet's calculate the exponents:\nThe number of generations for the plasmid-containing cells is $g_{+} = \\frac{720}{25.0} = 28.8$.\nThe number of generations for the cells without the plasmid is $g_{-} = \\frac{720}{20.0} = 36.0$.\n\nSo, the final population sizes are:\n$$N_{+}(T) = (0.00100 \\cdot N_{0}) \\cdot 2^{28.8}$$\n$$N_{-}(T) = (0.999 \\cdot N_{0}) \\cdot 2^{36.0}$$\n\nThe total final population, $N_{total}(T)$, is the sum of these two populations:\n$$N_{total}(T) = N_{+}(T) + N_{-}(T) = (0.00100 \\cdot N_{0}) \\cdot 2^{28.8} + (0.999 \\cdot N_{0}) \\cdot 2^{36.0}$$\n\nThe desired fraction, $F$, is the ratio of the final number of plasmid-containing cells to the total final number of cells:\n$$F = \\frac{N_{+}(T)}{N_{total}(T)} = \\frac{(0.00100 \\cdot N_{0}) \\cdot 2^{28.8}}{(0.00100 \\cdot N_{0}) \\cdot 2^{28.8} + (0.999 \\cdot N_{0}) \\cdot 2^{36.0}}$$\n\nThe initial total number of cells, $N_{0}$, cancels from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$F = \\frac{0.00100 \\cdot 2^{28.8}}{0.00100 \\cdot 2^{28.8} + 0.999 \\cdot 2^{36.0}}$$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the term $0.00100 \\cdot 2^{28.8}$:\n$$F = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{0.999}{0.00100} \\cdot \\frac{2^{36.0}}{2^{28.8}}}$$\n$$F = \\frac{1}{1 + 999 \\cdot 2^{36.0 - 28.8}}$$\n$$F = \\frac{1}{1 + 999 \\cdot 2^{7.2}}$$\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation:\nFirst, evaluate $2^{7.2}$:\n$2^{7.2} \\approx 147.025$\n\nNext, substitute this value into the expression for $F$:\n$$F \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 999 \\cdot 147.025}$$\n$$F \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 146877.975}$$\n$$F \\approx \\frac{1}{146878.975}$$\n$$F \\approx 6.8083 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n\nFinally, we round the answer to three significant figures as requested:\n$$F \\approx 6.81 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n\nThis result demonstrates that even a small growth advantage for the non-plasmid-containing cells leads to them completely dominating the culture over time, highlighting the critical importance of antibiotic selection in recombinant protein expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.81 \\times 10^{-6}}$$", "id": "2132915"}, {"introduction": "Once you have a robust culture, the next challenge is to express the protein in a soluble, correctly folded state. A frequent hurdle in high-yield bacterial expression is the formation of insoluble aggregates known as inclusion bodies. This problem presents a classic troubleshooting scenario, prompting you to identify the most effective initial strategy for improving protein solubility and developing a crucial skill for any protein scientist [@problem_id:2132935].", "problem": "A biomedical researcher is attempting to produce a human enzyme, which has a molecular weight of 65 kilodaltons (kDa), using a common recombinant protein expression system. The gene for the enzyme has been cloned into a pET plasmid, which places a gene under the control of a T7 promoter. This plasmid was transformed into an *Escherichia coli* (E. coli) BL21(DE3) host strain. The bacterial culture was grown in Luria-Bertani broth at 37°C to an optimal cell density. Subsequently, protein expression was induced by adding Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to the culture.\n\nAfter four hours of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and then lysed. The resulting cell lysate was separated into a soluble fraction (supernatant) and an insoluble fraction (pellet) by high-speed centrifugation. Analysis of both fractions using Sodium Dodecyl-Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealed that a prominent band at 65 kDa, corresponding to the target enzyme, was found almost exclusively in the insoluble pellet. The presence of the protein in this fraction suggests it has aggregated into insoluble inclusion bodies.\n\nFrom the options below, which represents the most common, cost-effective, and logical initial experimental strategy the researcher should attempt to increase the yield of soluble, correctly folded protein?\n\nA.

In BL21(DE3), IPTG induces the lacUV5-controlled T7 RNA polymerase, which then drives very high-level transcription from the T7 promoter. A very high translation rate can exceed the cellular folding capacity, causing misfolding and aggregation into inclusion bodies. The SDS-PAGE result shows the 65 kDa enzyme predominantly in the insoluble pellet, indicating that expression is strong but folding/solubility is limiting.\n\nTo increase the yield of soluble, correctly folded protein, the most common and cost-effective initial strategy is to slow down synthesis and allow more time for proper folding and for chaperone assistance. Decreasing the post-induction temperature to approximately 16°C to 25°C and extending the induction duration achieves this by reducing both transcriptional and translational rates and modulating protein folding kinetics in favor of solubility.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n- A changes the expression host to insect cells, which is more complex and costly and is not the logical first step when expression in *Escherichia coli* already yields high amounts of protein (albeit insoluble).\n- B increases IPTG concentration, which typically increases expression rate further and often exacerbates inclusion body formation.\n- C lowers the temperature post-induction and extends induction time, a standard, inexpensive, and widely effective first-line approach to improve solubility and folding in *Escherichia coli* expression systems.\n- D proposes adding 8 M urea to the growth medium, which would denature proteins and compromise cell viability; it is not an in vivo solubility strategy.\n- E suggests purification from the soluble fraction, but the SDS-PAGE indicates minimal protein is soluble; this does not address the underlying solubility problem.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate initial experimental strategy is to decrease post-induction temperature and extend induction time.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2132935"}, {"introduction": "After successful expression and initial purification, a common final step is to remove affinity tags to obtain the native protein. This practice explores a frustrating but common setback: the failure of a specific protease to cleave its recognition site, even when all components seem correct. Analyzing this scenario will deepen your understanding of how a protein's native three-dimensional structure can directly impact downstream processing and purification outcomes [@problem_id:2132980].", "problem": "A biotechnology researcher is working on the production of a novel enzyme, \"Kinase-Y,\" using a prokaryotic expression system. A synthetic gene for Kinase-Y was cloned into an expression vector designed to fuse a polyhistidine-tag (His-tag) to the N-terminus of the expressed protein. The design incorporates a specific recognition sequence for the thrombin protease, located between the His-tag and the Kinase-Y protein sequence. The intended structure is: (N-terminus)-His-tag--Thrombin Site--Kinase-Y-(C-terminus).\n\nThe researcher successfully expresses the fusion protein in *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*). The cells are lysed, and the soluble fraction of the lysate is applied to a Nickel-Nitriloacetic Acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography column. Subsequent analysis confirms that the ~55 kDa fusion protein has bound efficiently to the column, while most other *E. coli* proteins have been washed away.\n\nTo separate the Kinase-Y protein from its His-tag, the researcher performs an \"on-column cleavage\" by incubating the resin-bound protein with a buffered solution containing active thrombin. After the incubation period, the column is washed with a buffer to collect the cleaved Kinase-Y, which should no longer bind to the Ni-NTA resin. However, upon analyzing the collected fraction using gel electrophoresis, the researcher finds almost exclusively the original ~55 kDa uncleaved fusion protein. It is confirmed that the thrombin used in the experiment is fully active via a separate control assay, and sequencing of the expression plasmid verifies that the thrombin recognition site is correct.\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely biochemical reason for the failure of the thrombin cleavage?\n\nA. The majority of the Kinase-Y protein was expressed in an insoluble form as inclusion bodies.\n\nB. The thrombin cleavage site is sterically inaccessible to the protease, likely because it is obscured by the native three-dimensional fold of the Kinase-Y protein.\n\nC. The polyhistidine-tag directly binds to and inhibits the catalytic site of the thrombin protease.\n\nD. The Kinase-Y protein was rapidly degraded by endogenous proteases present in the *E. coli* lysate.\n\nE. The nickel ions leaching from the Ni-NTA resin chelated a critical cofactor required for thrombin activity.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most probable cause for the failure of thrombin to cleave the His-tag from the Kinase-Y fusion protein, given a set of specific experimental observations. We must evaluate each option based on the information provided.\n\nThe key observations are:\n1.  The protein is expressed in *E. coli*.\n2.  The protein is soluble and binds to the Ni-NTA column, indicating it has a functional His-tag and is not primarily in inclusion bodies.\n3.  The fusion protein has the correct mass (~55 kDa) and is intact after binding to the column.\n4.  The thrombin enzyme is active, and the cleavage site sequence is correct.\n5.  The result of the cleavage reaction is the recovery of the full-length, uncleaved fusion protein.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\n**A. The majority of the Kinase-Y protein was expressed in an insoluble form as inclusion bodies.**\nThis option is inconsistent with the experimental description. The problem states that the *soluble fraction* of the cell lysate was applied to the Ni-NTA column and that the fusion protein *bound efficiently*. If the protein were primarily in insoluble inclusion bodies, it would have been pelleted during centrifugation after cell lysis and would not have been present in the soluble fraction applied to the column. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**B. The thrombin cleavage site is sterically inaccessible to the protease, likely because it is obscured by the native three-dimensional fold of the Kinase-Y protein.**\nThis is a very plausible explanation. Proteases are large enzymes that require physical access to their specific, short amino acid recognition sequences. In this construct, the cleavage site is located between the His-tag and the main body of the Kinase-Y protein. If the N-terminal region of the fully folded Kinase-Y protein tucks into the core of its structure or is surrounded by other domains, the short linker containing the thrombin site may be buried or sterically hindered. This would prevent the bulky thrombin enzyme from binding to its recognition site and performing the cleavage. This scenario is a common problem in recombinant protein engineering and is consistent with all the observations: the protein is full-length, folded, and functional (at least in its ability to bind the column via the tag), but the cleavage site is not available.\n\n**C. The polyhistidine-tag directly binds to and inhibits the catalytic site of the thrombin protease.**\nThis is biochemically unlikely. Thrombin's substrate specificity is determined by its active site cleft, which recognizes the specific sequence Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser. A simple chain of histidine residues (the His-tag) does not resemble this substrate and is not a known general inhibitor of thrombin. While non-specific interactions can occur, direct inhibition of the catalytic site by a His-tag is not a documented or common phenomenon. This makes it a much less likely cause than steric hindrance.\n\n**D. The Kinase-Y protein was rapidly degraded by endogenous proteases present in the *E. coli* lysate.**\nThis is contradicted by the evidence. The analysis showed the recovery of the *full-length ~55 kDa fusion protein*. If widespread degradation by endogenous proteases had occurred, the result would be a smear on the gel, smaller protein fragments, or a complete loss of the protein band. The observation of an intact, uncleaved protein rules out significant degradation.\n\n**E. The nickel ions leaching from the Ni-NTA resin chelated a critical cofactor required for thrombin activity.**\nThrombin is a serine protease and does not require metal ion cofactors for its catalytic activity. Its function depends on a catalytic triad of amino acids (serine, histidine, and aspartate) in its active site. Therefore, the presence or absence of nickel ions would not directly impact its enzymatic function. This makes the proposed mechanism of inhibition incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy eliminating the other options, we are left with steric hindrance as the most scientifically sound explanation. The observation that a full-length, properly tagged protein fails to be cleaved by an active protease strongly points to a problem of accessibility of the cleavage site within the protein's native three-dimensional structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2132980"}]}
