The initial sample consists of the protein dissolved in a buffer solution, with a total volume of 15.0 mL. To prepare the sample for crystallization, it needs to be concentrated. The biochemist uses a centrifugal ultrafiltration device, which employs a semi-permeable membrane to allow the passage of water and small buffer salts while retaining the larger protein molecules. After centrifugation, the final volume of the concentrated protein solution is 750 µL.\n\nAssuming that no protein was lost during the ultrafiltration process (i.e., all protein molecules were retained by the membrane), calculate the theoretical concentration factor achieved.

Mass conservation during ultrafiltration implies no loss of protein, so the number of moles before and after are equal:\n$$\nn_{i} = n_{f}.\n$$\nUsing $n = C V$, this gives\n$$\nC_{i} V_{i} = C_{f} V_{f}.\n$$\nTherefore, the concentration factor (ratio of final to initial concentration) is\n$$\n\\frac{C_{f}}{C_{i}} = \\frac{V_{i}}{V_{f}}.\n$$\nTo compute this ratio, express both volumes in the same units.

This can be to remove salts, change the pH, or introduce specific cofactors. The following practice [@problem_id:2108497] simulates a common and powerful technique called discontinuous diafiltration, where a sample is repeatedly diluted and re-concentrated to efficiently wash away small, unwanted solutes.", "problem": "A biochemist is preparing a protein sample for a structural biology experiment. The protein is initially in a 1.00 mL solution containing a high concentration of sodium chloride, specifically 1.00 M NaCl, which needs to be reduced. The biochemist performs a single cycle of diafiltration. First, the 1.00 mL sample is diluted by adding a salt-free buffer until the total volume reaches 15.0 mL. Subsequently, this diluted solution is concentrated back down to a final volume of 1.00 mL using an ultrafiltration device. The ultrafiltration membrane used has a Molecular Weight Cutoff (MWCO) that is small enough to completely retain the protein but large enough to allow for the free passage of water and small solutes like sodium and chloride ions.\n\nWhat is the final molar concentration of NaCl in the 1.00 mL protein sample after this procedure?

This final practice [@problem_id:2108464] delves into a more complex and realistic scenario, challenging you to combine your understanding of ultrafiltration with the principles of chemical equilibrium. By considering a system of interacting proteins, you will see how a molecule's behavior during filtration depends not just on its own size, but also on the dynamic complexes it forms.", "problem": "A biochemist is preparing a sample for a structural biology experiment.
