The starting material is a concentrated stock solution of the enzyme with a concentration of $C_{stock} = 10.0$ mg/mL. For the experiment to yield reliable data, the enzyme concentration needs to be adjusted so that its absorbance at 280 nm is within the optimal linear range of the spectrophotometer.

This problem presents a common experimental challenge: obtaining an absorbance reading that is outside the valid range of your standard curve. Solving it requires critical thinking about the principles of assay validation and demonstrates the proper procedure for ensuring your final measurement is accurate and meaningful.", "problem": "A biochemistry student is tasked with determining the concentration of an unknown protein sample using a Bradford assay. The student prepares a series of standards using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and constructs a standard curve by plotting absorbance at 595 nm ($A_{595}$) versus protein concentration. The standard curve is found to be linear and reliable for absorbance values up to $A_{595} = 1.20$. When the student measures the absorbance of the undiluted unknown protein sample, the spectrophotometer reading is $A_{595} = 1.95$. What is the most appropriate and scientifically rigorous next step for the student to take to accurately determine the concentration of the unknown protein sample?\n\nA. Extrapolate the linear portion of the standard curve to find the concentration that corresponds to an absorbance of 1.95.\n\nB.

Let $A_{595}$ denote the absorbance at 595 nm and $c$ denote the protein concentration. Within the linear range, the relationship can be modeled as $A_{595} = mc + b$. For the dye-protein complex, the absorbance also follows the Beer-Lambert law, $A = \\epsilon c l$, where $\\epsilon$ is the apparent molar absorptivity and $l$ is the path length. The key constraint given is that the standard curve is linear and reliable only up to $A_{595} = 1.20$.\n\nThe measured absorbance for the undiluted unknown is $A_{595} = 1.95$, which lies outside the validated linear range. Therefore:\n- Extrapolating beyond the linear range (Option A) violates the established validity of the linear model and yields an unreliable concentration estimate.\n- Preparing more concentrated standards to extend the curve (Option B) does not resolve that the Bradford response often becomes nonlinear at higher protein concentrations due to dye saturation and other effects; the method’s validated linear range is explicitly capped at $A_{595} = 1.20$. Extending requires revalidation and is not the rigorous immediate step to quantify this unknown.\n- Measuring at 465 nm (Option C) targets the unbound dye and does not provide a calibrated linear relationship for protein concentration in the Bradford assay; it does not solve the nonlinearity at 595 nm for the protein–dye complex.\n- Changing path length (Option E) affects absorbance as $A \\propto l$; using a longer path length increases $A$, which worsens the problem and does not decrease the measured absorbance.\n\nThe scientifically rigorous approach is to dilute the unknown so that its measured absorbance falls within the validated linear range.
