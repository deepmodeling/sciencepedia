Lane 3 is empty or shows only very faint bands.", "solution": "The goal of this problem is to predict the outcome of a protein purification step as visualized by SDS-PAGE. The key principles are fractional precipitation (\"salting out\") and the mechanism of SDS-PAGE.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Principle of Fractional Precipitation.**\nAmmonium sulfate is a salt commonly used to purify proteins. At high concentrations, it sequesters water molecules that would otherwise hydrate the protein's surface. This reduces the protein's solubility, causing it to \"salt out\" or precipitate from the solution. Different proteins have different solubility characteristics and will precipitate at different salt concentrations. A \"successful\" fractional precipitation, as stated in the problem, means that the chosen ammonium sulfate concentration was effective at causing the target protein (FKZ) to precipitate while leaving many other \"contaminant\" proteins in solution.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Information Provided by Each Sample Lane.**\n- **Lane 1 (Crude Lysate):** This is the starting material. It represents the entire population of soluble proteins in the E. coli cell extract. Therefore, on an SDS-PAGE gel, this lane should display a large number of bands corresponding to the many different proteins of various molecular weights present in the cell. One of these bands, at 45 kDa, will be our target protein, FKZ.\n- **Lane 2 (Supernatant):** This sample is the liquid portion after the precipitation and centrifugation. It contains all the components that remained soluble at the specific ammonium sulfate concentration used. Since the precipitation of FKZ was successful, most of the FKZ protein should no longer be in the solution; it should be in the pellet. Therefore, this lane should still show bands for the contaminant proteins that remained soluble, but the specific band at 45 kDa corresponding to FKZ should be significantly fainter or missing entirely.\n- **Lane 3 (Re-dissolved Pellet):** This sample is the solid material that was precipitated by the ammonium sulfate and collected by centrifugation. Because the conditions were chosen to selectively precipitate FKZ, this pellet should be highly enriched in FKZ. When re-dissolved and loaded onto the gel, this lane should show a very prominent, strong band at 45 kDa. Any other bands present would be from contaminant proteins that co-precipitated, but for a successful step, these should be much fainter than the FKZ band.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options Based on the Analysis.**\n\n- **Option A:** This describes a scenario where no precipitation occurred. The supernatant (Lane 2) is identical to the crude lysate (Lane 1), and the pellet (Lane 3) is empty. This contradicts the premise that the precipitation was successful.\n- **Option B:** This description perfectly matches our analysis.\n    - Lane 1 (Crude): \"many bands... including one at 45 kDa.\" This is correct for the starting material.\n    - Lane 2 (Supernatant): \"45 kDa band is significantly reduced in intensity or absent.\" This correctly reflects the removal of FKZ from the solution.\n    - Lane 3 (Pellet): \"a single, highly prominent band at 45 kDa and very few, faint bands.\" This correctly describes the enrichment of the target protein in the precipitated fraction.\n- **Option C:** This describes a scenario where everything precipitated out of the solution. The supernatant (Lane 2) is empty, and the pellet (Lane 3) contains all the proteins from the crude lysate. This would not be considered a \"fractional\" or \"selective\" precipitation; it is total precipitation and does not achieve any purification.\n- **Option D:** This describes the opposite of what should happen. It suggests that the target protein, FKZ, was the most soluble protein and was enriched in the supernatant (Lane 2), while other proteins precipitated into the empty pellet (Lane 3). This is the reverse of a successful salting-out procedure for FKZ.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the principles of fractional precipitation and SDS-PAGE, Option B is the only choice that accurately describes the expected outcome of a successful purification step where the target protein is selectively precipitated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2134938"}]}
