By running a set of standard proteins with known masses, we can create a calibration curve that plots the elution volume ($V_e$) against the logarithm of the molecular weight. This exercise [@problem_id:2138002] guides you through the process of using data from two standards to define a linear relationship and then applying it to determine the size of a novel protein from its elution volume.", "problem": "A biochemist is working to determine the molecular weight of a newly discovered protein using size-exclusion chromatography. In this technique, a mixture of proteins is passed through a column packed with porous beads. Larger proteins are excluded from the pores and thus travel a shorter path, eluting from the column earlier (at a lower elution volume). Conversely, smaller proteins can enter the pores, increasing their path length and causing them to elute later (at a higher elution volume).\n\nFor a given column, there is a linear relationship between the elution volume ($V_e$) and the base-10 logarithm of the molecular weight (MW) of a protein over a specific range. To calibrate the column, the biochemist first runs two standard proteins with known molecular weights:\n- Standard A (Thyroglobulin): MW = 669 kDa, Elution Volume = 12.5 mL\n- Standard B (Bovine Serum Albumin, BSA): MW = 66.5 kDa, Elution Volume = 18.0 mL\n\nAfter calibration, the biochemist runs their unknown protein through the same column and finds that it elutes at a volume of 15.2 mL.\n\nAssuming the unknown protein falls within the linear separation range of the column, calculate the approximate molecular weight of this protein.

This distinction is critical when analyzing molecules with different shapes. This conceptual problem [@problem_id:2138013] presents a common real-world scenario where a compact, globular protein is mixed with elongated, rod-like DNA fragments of a similar mass, challenging you to predict the elution order by considering their effective sizes in solution.", "problem": "A biochemist is working with a purified preparation of a monomeric, globular protein which has a molecular weight of 66 kDa. During quality control analysis, it is discovered that the sample is contaminated with small, double-stranded fragments of DNA. The average length of these DNA fragments is 100 base pairs (bp). To separate the protein from the contaminant, the biochemist runs the mixture through a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column. The SEC column operates under ideal conditions, where separation is based solely on the hydrodynamic radius of the molecules, and there are no electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions between the analytes and the column matrix. The molecular weight of a single DNA base pair is approximately 650 Da.\n\nBased on the principles of SEC and the nature of the molecules involved, which of the following outcomes is most likely?\n\nA.

Under ideal SEC, analytes partition between the interstitial space and the interior of porous beads solely according to hydrodynamic size. The relevant elution relation is\n$$\nV_{e} \\;=\\; V_{0} \\;+\\; K_{d}\\,\\bigl(V_{t}-V_{0}\\bigr),\n$$\nwhere $V_{e}$ is the elution volume, $V_{0}$ is the void volume (interstitial volume), $V_{t}$ is the total column volume, and $K_{d}$ is the distribution coefficient, which is a monotonically decreasing function of the hydrodynamic radius $R_{h}$. Larger $R_{h}$ implies greater exclusion from pores, smaller accessible volume, smaller $K_{d}$, and thus smaller $V_{e}$; consequently, larger particles elute earlier.\n\nNext, compare the analytes by hydrodynamic size rather than molecular weight, because SEC resolves species by $R_{h}$, not mass. The protein is a monomeric, globular species of molecular weight $M_{\\text{prot}} = 66 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{Da}$, and globular proteins approximate compact spheres; for a given mass, this geometry minimizes $R_{h}$.\n\nThe DNA contaminants are double-stranded fragments of average length $n=100$ base pairs with mass\n$$\nM_{\\text{DNA}} \\;\\approx\\; n \\times 650\\ \\text{Da},\n$$\nwhich is comparable to $M_{\\text{prot}}$.
