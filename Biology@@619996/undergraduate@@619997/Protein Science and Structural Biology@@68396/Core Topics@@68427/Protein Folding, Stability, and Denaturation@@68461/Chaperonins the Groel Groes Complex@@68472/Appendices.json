The GroEL component consists of two heptameric rings stacked back-to-back, forming a central cavity. In its substrate-receptive state (often called the *trans* ring or the \"open\" ATP-bound state), the apical domains of the GroEL subunits line this cavity with hydrophobic amino acid residues. This architecture is crucial for capturing unfolded or misfolded substrate proteins, which are characterized by the exposure of their own hydrophobic amino acid side chains to the aqueous environment.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered variant of GroEL in which a series of site-directed mutations have been introduced into the apical domains. These mutations systematically replace the key hydrophobic residues lining the central cavity (such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine) with polar and charged residues (such as aspartate, glutamate, and lysine). This modification results in a central cavity that is strongly and permanently hydrophilic, even in its \"open\", substrate-receptive conformation.\n\nAssuming all other aspects of the GroEL structure and its ability to bind ATP and GroES remain intact, what is the most direct and significant consequence of this hydrophilic-cavity mutation for the substrate capture step of the chaperonin cycle?\n\nA.

The mutant GroEL would lose its ability to bind to the co-chaperonin GroES cap.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the effect of changing the GroEL folding cavity from hydrophobic to hydrophilic on its ability to capture substrate proteins.\n\nStep 1: Understand the principle of substrate recognition by wild-type GroEL.\nThe substrates for the GroEL/GroES system are proteins that are not in their native, folded conformation. A key feature of such unfolded or misfolded proteins is the exposure of hydrophobic amino acid residues (like leucine, valine, phenylalanine) to the aqueous solvent of the cell's cytoplasm. This exposure is thermodynamically unfavorable, driving these proteins to aggregate in a non-specific manner. The GroEL chaperonin prevents this by providing a binding site for these aggregation-prone proteins.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the nature of the wild-type GroEL-substrate interaction.\nThe \"open\" or substrate-receptive form of GroEL has a central cavity lined with hydrophobic amino acid residues. This creates a non-polar environment. When an unfolded protein with exposed hydrophobic patches encounters this cavity, the hydrophobic patches can partition from the aqueous cytosol into the hydrophobic cavity. This is driven by the hydrophobic effect: the system's entropy increases as water molecules, previously ordered around the hydrophobic patches, are released. This favorable hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction is the primary driving force for the capture of the substrate protein by GroEL.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the effect of the specified mutation.\nThe problem describes a mutant GroEL where the hydrophobic lining of the cavity has been replaced with hydrophilic (polar and charged) residues. The cavity's environment is now polar and solvated, much like the surrounding cytosol.\n\nStep 4: Predict the interaction between the mutant GroEL and an unfolded substrate.\nAn unfolded substrate protein still presents its exposed hydrophobic patches. When this substrate encounters the now-hydrophilic cavity of the mutant GroEL, there is no longer a favorable interaction. Trying to bind a hydrophobic patch to a hydrophilic surface is energetically unfavorable, akin to trying to dissolve oil in water. The thermodynamic driving force for binding, the hydrophobic effect, has been eliminated and replaced with a repulsive or unfavorable interaction. Consequently, the substrate protein will have a very low affinity for the binding cavity.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n- A. The binding affinity of the mutant GroEL for its typical unfolded protein substrates would be dramatically reduced. This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The loss of the hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction severely impairs the ability of GroEL to capture its substrates. This is the correct answer.\n\n- B. The binding affinity of the mutant GroEL for its typical unfolded protein substrates would be dramatically increased. This is incorrect. It represents a misunderstanding of the chemical principles involved. A hydrophilic cavity would repel, not attract, the hydrophobic patches of an unfolded protein.\n\n- C. The mutant GroEL would now preferentially bind to correctly folded proteins instead of unfolded ones. This is incorrect for two reasons. First, correctly folded proteins typically bury their hydrophobic residues and present a largely hydrophilic surface; there would be no strong specific attraction to the new hydrophilic cavity. Second, the primary function of GroEL is to act on non-native proteins, and this mutation does not provide a plausible mechanism to switch its specificity to native ones.\n\n- D. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by the mutant GroEL would become constitutively high, even in the absence of substrate or GroES. This is incorrect. The GroEL ATPase cycle is complex and allosterically regulated. While substrate binding influences the cycle, large-scale ATP hydrolysis is primarily triggered by the binding of the GroES cap. The inability to bind substrate would likely lead to a stalled or futile cycle, not constitutive activation.\n\n- E. The mutant GroEL would lose its ability to bind to the co-chaperonin GroES cap. The problem states that the mutations are in the residues *lining the central cavity*. The binding surface for GroES is at the *rim* of the apical domain. While these regions are part of the same domain, it is assumed in the problem (\"Assuming all other aspects...remain intact\") and generally true that the cavity lining and the GroES binding interface are formed by different sets of residues. Therefore, altering the cavity's hydrophobicity does not necessarily disrupt GroES binding.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and significant consequence is the near-total loss of the ability to capture unfolded protein substrates due to the removal of the critical hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2103565"}, {"introduction": "Once a substrate protein is captured, it is encapsulated within the GroEL central cavity—an \"Anfinsen cage\"—to fold in isolation.

The GroEL component is a large, barrel-shaped complex made of two stacked rings. Each ring is a heptamer, meaning it is composed of seven identical subunits. The GroES component is a smaller, cap-like complex, also a heptamer, that binds to and unbinds from the ends of the GroEL barrel.\n\nThe protein folding cycle, powered by the hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), proceeds as follows:\n1.  A misfolded substrate protein and seven molecules of ATP bind to the subunits of one of the GroEL rings (the 'cis' ring).\n2.  The GroES cap binds to this 'cis' ring, encapsulating the substrate protein inside an isolated folding chamber.\n3.

The release of the GroES cap, the seven ADP molecules, and the substrate protein from the 'cis' ring is allosterically triggered by the binding of a new set of seven ATP molecules to the opposite ring (the 'trans' ring).
