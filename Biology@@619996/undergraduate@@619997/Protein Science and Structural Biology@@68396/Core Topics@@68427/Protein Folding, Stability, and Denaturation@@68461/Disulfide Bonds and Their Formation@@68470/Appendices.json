In its final, biologically active form, it is known that all eight of these cysteine residues are paired up to form four disulfide bonds. Calculate the total number of distinct ways these eight cysteine residues can be linked to form four disulfide bonds.", "solution": "We have eight distinguishable cysteine residues that must be partitioned into four unordered pairs. This is the number of perfect matchings on a set of size eight.\n\nA direct counting method uses permutations with symmetry corrections:\n- Arrange the eight residues in all possible orders: there are $8!$ permutations.\n- Group the sequence into four adjacent ordered pairs: $(1,2),(3,4),(5,6),(7,8)$.\n- Within each pair, the order does not matter, so divide by $2$ for each of the four pairs, giving a factor $2^{4}$.\n- The four pairs themselves are unordered, so divide by $4!$.\n\nThus, the total number of distinct pairings is\n$$\n\\frac{8!}{2^{4}4!}.\n$$\nEvaluating,\n$$\n\\frac{8!}{2^{4}4!}=105.\n$$\nEquivalently, this equals the double factorial $(8-1)!!=7!!=7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=105$, obtained by successively choosing a partner for the least-indexed unpaired residue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{105}$$", "id": "2108973"}, {"introduction": "Once a protein is folded and its disulfide bonds are formed, a key experimental question is to verify their structural role. This problem simulates a common biochemical approach used to determine if a protein's quaternary structure is maintained by disulfide linkages. By interpreting the results from a size-exclusion chromatography experiment before and after treatment with a reducing agent [@problem_id:2108987], you will practice thinking like an experimental biochemist to deduce protein architecture.", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating a newly characterized protein, which we will call \"Oligomerin\". Initial experiments suggest that Oligomerin is an oligomer, meaning it is composed of multiple polypeptide subunits. To investigate the nature of the forces holding the oligomer together, the biochemist performs a size-exclusion chromatography (also known as gel filtration chromatography) experiment.\n\nTwo samples of purified Oligomerin are prepared:\n1.  **Sample A (Control):** Oligomerin is dissolved in a standard phosphate buffer.\n2.  **Sample B (Treated):** Oligomerin is dissolved in the same phosphate buffer, to which a high concentration of the reducing agent Dithiothreitol (DTT) has been added.\n\nEach sample is injected separately onto a calibrated size-exclusion chromatography column. The protein concentration in the eluate is monitored, and the elution volume at which the protein peak appears is recorded. The column has a void volume (the elution volume for very large, fully excluded molecules) of 8.0 mL.\n\nThe experimental results are as follows:\n-   For **Sample A**, a single, sharp protein peak is observed at an elution volume of 14.5 mL.\n-   For **Sample B**, a single, sharp protein peak is observed at an elution volume of 19.0 mL.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion about the structure of Oligomerin?\n\nA. The subunits of Oligomerin are linked by covalent disulfide bonds.\n\nB. Oligomerin is a monomeric protein that becomes more compact in the presence of DTT.\n\nC. The subunits of Oligomerin are linked by non-covalent interactions, and the addition of DTT causes the protein to aggregate into a larger complex.\n\nD. The subunits of Oligomerin are linked by non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.\n\nE. Oligomerin is a monomeric protein, and DTT causes it to partially unfold, increasing its hydrodynamic radius.", "solution": "Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) separates species by hydrodynamic radius. The elution volume $V_{e}$ relates to the partition coefficient $K_{av}$ by\n$$\nK_{av}=\\frac{V_{e}-V_{0}}{V_{t}-V_{0}},\n$$\nwhere $V_{0}$ is the void volume and $V_{t}$ is the total column volume. For a given column, larger hydrodynamic radius implies smaller $K_{av}$ and therefore smaller $V_{e}$; conversely, smaller hydrodynamic radius implies larger $K_{av}$ and larger $V_{e}$. Equivalently, for two species $a$ and $b$ on the same column,\n$$\nV_{e,a}<V_{e,b}\\iff R_{h,a}>R_{h,b}.\n$$\n\nGiven $V_{0}=8.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, Sample A elutes at $V_{e,A}=14.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ and Sample B (with DTT) at $V_{e,B}=19.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. Since $V_{e,B}>V_{e,A}$, it follows that the species in Sample B has a smaller hydrodynamic radius than the species in Sample A:\n$$\nV_{e,B}>V_{e,A}\\implies R_{h,B}<R_{h,A}.\n$$\n\nDithiothreitol (DTT) is a reducing agent that specifically reduces disulfide bonds. The relevant chemical transformation is\n$$\n\\mathrm{R{-}S{-}S{-}R'}+\\mathrm{DTT}_{\\mathrm{red}}\\to \\mathrm{R{-}SH}+\\mathrm{R'{-}SH}+\\mathrm{DTT}_{\\mathrm{ox}}.\n$$\nIf Oligomerin subunits are covalently linked by intersubunit disulfide bonds, reduction by DTT would break these covalent links, converting a larger disulfide-linked oligomer into smaller subunits or a smaller oligomer. This predicts a decrease in hydrodynamic radius upon DTT treatment, which matches the observation $V_{e,B}>V_{e,A}$.\n\nAlternative explanations are inconsistent with the SEC results:\n- If Oligomerin were monomeric and became more compact with DTT (option B), $R_{h}$ would decrease and $V_{e}$ should decrease, not increase.\n- If DTT induced aggregation (option C), $R_{h}$ would increase and $V_{e}$ would decrease, contrary to the data.\n- If subunits were held only by non-covalent interactions (option D), DTT would not be expected to alter oligomerization, yet a clear shift is observed.\n- If DTT caused partial unfolding of a monomer (option E), $R_{h}$ would increase and $V_{e}$ would decrease, not increase.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the subunits are linked by covalent disulfide bonds that are reduced by DTT, yielding smaller species that elute later on SEC.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2108987"}, {"introduction": "Disulfide bonds are not merely structural \"staples\"; they are major contributors to the overall stability of a protein. This practice problem delves into the energetic consequences of these covalent cross-links by examining the impact of a specific mutation on a protein's melting temperature ($T_m$) [@problem_id:2109003]. Analyzing this hypothetical scenario allows us to understand the significant stabilizing effect of a disulfide bond and its importance for proteins that must function in extreme environments.", "problem": "A team of biochemists is studying a novel enzyme, thermolysin-X, isolated from a thermophilic archaeon living near hydrothermal vents. This enzyme shows remarkable stability at high temperatures. The native, wild-type enzyme has a melting temperature ($T_m$), defined as the temperature at which 50% of the enzyme molecules are unfolded, of 95.0 °C. To investigate the structural features responsible for this stability, the researchers create a mutant version of the enzyme where a specific cysteine residue at position 88 is replaced by a serine residue (Cys88Ser). Upon characterization, they find that the mutant enzyme has a dramatically reduced melting temperature of 62.0 °C, although it still retains some catalytic activity at lower temperatures.\n\nBased on this experimental observation, what is the most likely structural role of the original cysteine residue at position 88 in the wild-type enzyme?\n\nA. The cysteine residue's sulfhydryl group was a critical nucleophile in the enzyme's active site, and its replacement by a hydroxyl group altered the catalytic mechanism.\n\nB. The cysteine residue was located in the hydrophobic core, and its replacement by the more hydrophilic serine disrupted crucial non-polar interactions.\n\nC. The cysteine residue formed a covalent disulfide bond with another cysteine residue elsewhere in the protein, creating a cross-link that stabilized the folded tertiary structure.\n\nD. The larger van der Waals radius of the sulfur atom in cysteine compared to the oxygen atom in serine was essential for the tight packing of the protein's interior.\n\nE. The serine residue's hydroxyl group formed new, unfavorable hydrogen bonds within the protein structure that actively destabilized the folded state.", "solution": "We interpret the melting temperature $T_{m}$ as the temperature at which the folded and unfolded states have equal Gibbs free energy, so $\\Delta G_{\\text{unf}}(T_{m}) = 0$. Using $\\Delta G_{\\text{unf}}(T) = \\Delta H_{\\text{unf}} - T \\Delta S_{\\text{unf}}$, the condition at $T_{m}$ gives\n$$\nT_{m} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{unf}}}{\\Delta S_{\\text{unf}}}.\n$$\nA large decrease in $T_{m}$ upon mutation indicates a substantial destabilization of the folded state relative to the unfolded state, which can arise from either a decrease in $\\Delta H_{\\text{unf}}$ (loss of favorable interactions in the folded state) or an increase in $\\Delta S_{\\text{unf}}$ (greater entropy of the unfolded state), or both.\n\nA covalent disulfide bond between two cysteines provides a strong enthalpic contribution to the folded state and, critically, reduces the entropy of the unfolded ensemble by covalently constraining the polypeptide chain. In the standard thermodynamic framework, introducing a disulfide decreases $\\Delta S_{\\text{unf}}$ (because the unfolded state is constrained), thereby increasing $T_{m}$ via $T_{m} = \\Delta H_{\\text{unf}} / \\Delta S_{\\text{unf}}$. Conversely, removing a disulfide increases $\\Delta S_{\\text{unf}}$, which lowers $T_{m}$ markedly. The observed dramatic drop in $T_{m}$ is thus most consistent with disruption of a disulfide cross-link.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A suggests an active-site nucleophile role. While a Cys to Ser change can alter catalytic mechanism, the data specifically emphasize a large decrease in thermal stability ($T_{m}$), and the mutant still retains some catalytic activity. This points to a structural rather than catalytic function.\n- Option B posits hydrophobic core disruption. Although Cys is more hydrophobic than Ser, a single Cys to Ser swap without a covalent cross-link typically does not reduce $T_{m}$ so drastically.\n- Option C explains the large stabilization effect via a disulfide bond, which both strengthens enthalpic interactions and reduces unfolded-state entropy, aligning with the large $T_{m}$ shift.\n- Option D attributes stability to van der Waals packing differences between sulfur and oxygen. Such subtle packing effects generally do not produce a large $T_{m}$ decrease.\n- Option E proposes new unfavorable hydrogen bonds by Ser; proteins typically avoid strongly unfavorable internal hydrogen bonding, and such an effect is less likely and would be idiosyncratic rather than a general, strong stabilizer/destabilizer like a disulfide.\n\nTherefore, the most likely structural role of Cys88 is participation in a disulfide bond that stabilizes the folded structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2109003"}]}
