The steepness of the transition is mathematically defined as the derivative of the fraction of unfolded protein, $f_u$, with respect to temperature, $T$, evaluated at the melting temperature, $T_m$.\n\nFirst, let's define the equilibrium for the two-state model: $N \\rightleftharpoons U$.\nThe equilibrium constant for unfolding is given by $K_u = \\frac{[U]}{[N]}$, where $[U]$ and $[N]$ are the concentrations of the unfolded and native states, respectively.\n\nThe fraction of unfolded protein, $f_u$, can be expressed in terms of the equilibrium constant:\n$$f_u = \\frac{[U]}{[N] + [U]}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[N]$, we get:\n$$f_u = \\frac{[U]/[N]}{[N]/[N] + [U]/[N]} = \\frac{K_u}{1 + K_u}$$\n\nThe steepness of the melting curve at any temperature $T$ is the derivative $\\frac{df_u}{dT}$.

By definition, at $T=T_m$, the concentrations of folded and unfolded proteins are equal, so $[N]=[U]$. This implies that the equilibrium constant at the melting temperature is $K_u(T_m) = 1$.\nSubstituting $K_u=1$ into the expression for the steepness at $T_m$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{df_u}{dT}\\right)_{T=T_m} = \\frac{1}{(1+1)^2} \\left(\\frac{dK_u}{dT}\\right)_{T=T_m} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{dK_u}{dT}\\right)_{T=T_m}$$\n\nTo find the term $\\frac{dK_u}{dT}$, we use the van 't Hoff equation, which relates the temperature dependence of an equilibrium constant to the standard enthalpy change of the reaction. For the unfolding process:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln K_u)}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_u}{RT^2}$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $\\Delta H_u$ is the standard molar enthalpy of unfolding.\n\nUsing the chain rule for derivatives, $\\frac{d(\\ln K_u)}{dT} = \\frac{1}{K_u} \\frac{dK_u}{dT}$.

For this particular experiment, the signals for the pure states are constant and do not depend on the denaturant concentration. The true values are $S_N = 1.00$ and $S_U = 3.00$ (in arbitrary fluorescence units).\n\nHowever, due to an experimental error in establishing the post-transition baseline, the biophysicist incorrectly assumes the signal for the pure unfolded state is $S'_U = 2.80$. The native state baseline signal $S_N$ is determined correctly. The biophysicist then calculates the apparent transition midpoint, $C'_m$, as the denaturant concentration where the observed signal is exactly halfway between their assumed native and unfolded baselines.\n\nCalculate the value of this apparent transition midpoint, $C'_m$.

The observed signal at any concentration $C$ is given by the true physical relationship:\n$$ S_{obs}(C) = (1 - f_U(C)) S_N + f_U(C) S_U $$\nHere, we must use the true value of the unfolded signal, $S_U = 3.00$.
