This exercise explores this principle through a thought experiment involving a mutation in a structurally critical region of a protein. By considering the unique properties of glycine versus tryptophan, you will practice predicting how a change at a single position can have dramatic consequences for the protein's overall thermal stability ($T_m$), a key concept in protein design and evolution [@problem_id:2128005].", "problem": "A team of biochemists is studying a thermostable enzyme isolated from a thermophilic bacterium. The enzyme's three-dimensional structure reveals that its catalytic activity depends on the precise orientation of two domains, which are connected by a short, flexible linker region. A key structural feature of this linker is a tight reverse turn, often called a beta-turn. At a crucial position within this turn, where the polypeptide chain must make a very sharp change in direction, a glycine residue is found. To investigate the structural importance of this residue, the researchers use site-directed mutagenesis to create a mutant version of the enzyme in which the glycine residue is replaced by a tryptophan residue. They then measure the thermal stability of both the wild-type and the mutant enzyme. The thermal stability is quantified by the melting temperature ($T_m$), defined as the temperature at which half of the enzyme molecules are in the unfolded state.\n\nBased on the principles of protein structure and stability, predict the most likely effect of this Glycine-to-Tryptophan mutation on the enzyme's melting temperature ($T_m$).\n\nA. The $T_m$ will significantly increase because the larger, hydrophobic tryptophan side chain will be buried from the solvent, strengthening the hydrophobic core.\n\nB. The $T_m$ will significantly decrease because the bulky tryptophan side chain will cause severe steric clashes within the constrained geometry of the tight turn.\n\nC. The $T_m$ will remain essentially unchanged because the mutation occurs in a flexible linker region, which does not contribute significantly to the overall stability of the protein.\n\nD. The $T_m$ will slightly increase due to stabilizing pi-stacking interactions that the aromatic tryptophan ring can form with the peptide backbone.\n\nE. The $T_m$ will be unpredictable, as the effect could be either stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the surrounding amino acid sequence.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect on a protein's melting temperature ($T_m$) when a glycine residue in a tight turn is mutated to a tryptophan residue. This requires an understanding of amino acid properties, protein secondary structure, and the thermodynamic basis of protein stability.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the properties of the amino acids involved.\n- **Glycine (Gly):** Glycine is the smallest amino acid. Its side chain is simply a hydrogen atom. This makes it unique in two ways: it is achiral, and it is extremely flexible. The lack of a bulky side chain allows the polypeptide backbone around a glycine residue to adopt a much wider range of Ramachandran angles (phi ($\\phi$) and psi ($\\psi$) dihedral angles) than any other amino acid.\n- **Tryptophan (Trp):** Tryptophan has the largest side chain of all the common amino acids. It consists of a bulky bicyclic indole group. This large, rigid side chain sterically restricts the possible conformations of the local polypeptide backbone.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the structural context of the mutation.\nThe mutation occurs in a \"tight reverse turn\" or \"beta-turn\". These are common secondary structure motifs where the polypeptide chain reverses its direction over a span of just four amino acid residues. To achieve this sharp turn, at least one of the central residues (positions i+1 or i+2) must adopt dihedral angles that fall into regions of the Ramachandran plot that are sterically forbidden for most amino acids with a $C_{\\beta}$ atom in their side chain.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the suitability of Glycine and Tryptophan in this context.\n- **Glycine in a turn:** Glycine's conformational flexibility makes it ideally suited for tight turns. It can easily adopt the \"forbidden\" dihedral angles required to form the turn without introducing any steric strain. For this reason, glycine is statistically overrepresented in beta-turns in known protein structures.\n- **Tryptophan in a turn:** In contrast, the large and rigid indole side chain of tryptophan would clash severely with the backbone atoms of itself and its neighboring residues if it were forced to adopt the dihedral angles required for a tight turn. It is sterically incompatible with the constrained geometry of such a structural element.\n\nStep 4: Connect the structural change to thermodynamic stability.\nProtein stability is a function of the Gibbs free energy of folding ($\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$), which is the difference in free energy between the folded state ($G_{\\text{folded}}$) and the unfolded state ($G_{\\text{unfolded}}$). A more stable protein has a more negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$.\nThe introduction of the bulky tryptophan into the tight turn will introduce significant steric strain and unfavorable van der Waals repulsions. This will raise the energy of the folded state ($G_{\\text{folded}}$). The energy of the unfolded state ($G_{\\text{unfolded}}$) is largely unaffected as the side chain is free to move. Therefore, the overall $\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}} = G_{\\text{folded}} - G_{\\text{unfolded}}$ will become less negative (i.e., it will increase, moving closer to zero). This signifies a destabilization of the protein.\n\nStep 5: Relate thermodynamic stability to the melting temperature ($T_m$).\nThe melting temperature ($T_m$) is the temperature where the folded and unfolded states are equally populated, meaning $\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}(T_m) = 0$. A protein that has been destabilized (has a less negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$ at a reference temperature) will require less thermal energy to reach the point where unfolding is favored. As temperature increases, entropy favors the unfolded state. For the destabilized mutant, the entropic contribution will overcome the enthalpic stability of the folded state at a lower temperature compared to the wild-type protein. Consequently, the melting temperature ($T_m$) will decrease.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the options.\n- A is incorrect. While tryptophan is hydrophobic, its destabilizing steric effect in this specific structural context far outweighs any potential stabilizing hydrophobic effect. The location is not in the hydrophobic core but in a turn.\n- B is correct. It accurately identifies that the primary effect will be destabilization due to steric hindrance from the bulky side chain in a spatially constrained position, leading to a decrease in $T_m$.\n- C is incorrect. Even though it's in a linker, the turn is structurally critical. Disrupting it will destabilize the protein. Linker regions are not necessarily devoid of important structure.\n- D is incorrect. While tryptophan can form pi-stacking interactions, it is highly unlikely to be able to do so in a conformation that would both form a tight turn and be energetically favorable. The steric clash is the dominant energetic term.\n- E is incorrect. While the exact magnitude of the change depends on the local environment, the fundamental principles of steric hindrance make the qualitative prediction of destabilization (and thus a decreased $T_m$) very reliable.\n\nTherefore, the mutation will significantly destabilize the protein, resulting in a lower melting temperature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2128005"}, {"introduction": "While some proteins fold in a simple, cooperative step, many navigate a more complex energy landscape involving one or more intermediate states. A crucial skill for a protein scientist is interpreting experimental data to distinguish between these pathways.
