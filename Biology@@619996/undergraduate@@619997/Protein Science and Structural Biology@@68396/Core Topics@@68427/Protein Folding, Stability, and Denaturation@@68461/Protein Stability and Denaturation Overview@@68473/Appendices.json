This practice explores this fundamental principle by asking you to predict the stability change, measured by melting temperature ($T_m$), when a charged residue is forced into the core [@problem_id:2130662].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a small, globular, water-soluble protein that is known to be highly stable. The three-dimensional structure reveals a densely packed hydrophobic core composed entirely of nonpolar amino acid residues. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the biochemist creates a mutant version of the protein by replacing a single leucine residue, located in the geometric center of this hydrophobic core, with a glutamate residue. The thermal stability of both the original (wild-type) and the mutant protein is then compared by measuring their melting temperature ($T_m$), defined as the temperature at which half of the protein population is in the unfolded state. The experiment is conducted in an aqueous buffer at a constant pH of 7.4.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the effect of this Leu-to-Glu mutation on the protein's melting temperature?\n\nA. The $T_m$ will significantly increase because the glutamate residue will form a stabilizing salt bridge within the core.\n\nB. The $T_m$ will significantly decrease because introducing a charged residue into a nonpolar environment is energetically unfavorable.\n\nC. The $T_m$ will remain essentially unchanged because the alteration of a single amino acid residue out of many has a negligible impact on overall protein stability.\n\nD. The $T_m$ will slightly increase because glutamate has a larger side chain than leucine, leading to more favorable van der Waals interactions and better packing within the core.\n\nE. The $T_m$ will significantly decrease because the larger glutamate side chain will cause steric clashes that disrupt the core packing.", "solution": "Define the folding free energy of the protein as $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(T)=\\Delta H-\\!T\\,\\Delta S$ under a two-state assumption. The melting temperature $T_{m}$ is the temperature at which $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(T_{m})=0$, hence\n$$\nT_{m}=\\frac{\\Delta H}{\\Delta S}.\n$$\nA mutation that destabilizes the folded state makes $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ less negative (or more positive) at a given temperature and typically lowers $T_{m}$ by reducing the favorable enthalpic and/or entropic contributions that stabilize the native state.\n\nReplacing a buried leucine (nonpolar) at the geometric center of a densely packed hydrophobic core with glutamate introduces a polar/charged side chain into a low-dielectric, nonpolar environment. At pH $7.4$, glutamate is deprotonated in water (nominal charge $q=-1$), and even if its $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ shifts upward in the hydrophobic core, there remains a large penalty associated with burying a charged or strongly polar group without compensating interactions. The electrostatic cost of transferring a charge from water (dielectric $\\epsilon_{\\text{out}}$) to a hydrophobic core (dielectric $\\epsilon_{\\text{in}}\\ll\\epsilon_{\\text{out}}$) can be approximated by the Born desolvation energy:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{Born}}=\\frac{q^{2}}{8\\pi\\epsilon_{0}r}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\text{in}}}-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\text{out}}}\\right)>0,\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity and $r$ is the effective radius of the charge. Because $\\epsilon_{\\text{in}}\\ll\\epsilon_{\\text{out}}$, this term is strongly positive, indicating a substantial destabilization of the folded state when the charged/polar group is buried without partners for salt bridges or hydrogen bonds. The problem statement specifies a nonpolar core and gives no partner for a salt bridge; placing the mutation at the geometric center minimizes access to solvent or polar groups, so no compensating stabilization is expected.\n\nConsequently, in the mutant, the folded stateâ€™s enthalpy is less favorable (loss of hydrophobic packing plus desolvation penalty), and there is no compensatory interaction. This raises $G_{\\text{folded}}$ relative to $G_{\\text{unfolded}}$, making $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ less negative and lowering $T_{m}$ via\n$$\nT_{m,\\text{mut}}=\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{mut}}}{\\Delta S_{\\text{mut}}}<\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{wt}}}{\\Delta S_{\\text{wt}}}=T_{m,\\text{wt}},\n$$\ngiven that the dominant effect is a decrease in stabilizing $\\Delta H$ (and no reason to expect a compensatory decrease in $\\Delta S$ sufficient to raise the ratio). Therefore, the mutation is predicted to significantly decrease the melting temperature.\n\nAssessment of the options:\n- A is incorrect: there is no basis for a stabilizing salt bridge in a nonpolar core lacking complementary charges.\n- B is correct: burying a charged residue in a hydrophobic core is energetically unfavorable, leading to a significant decrease in $T_{m}$.\n- C is incorrect: single substitutions in a protein core often have large effects on stability.\n- D is incorrect: glutamate does not improve packing in a hydrophobic core; its polarity dominates and disfavors burial.\n- E is less accurate: while steric effects can matter, glutamate is not reliably larger than leucine, and the principal, well-established destabilizing factor is the electrostatic desolvation penalty, not steric clash per se.\n\nHence, the most accurate prediction is a significant decrease in $T_{m}$ due to the unfavorable burial of a charged/polar residue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2130662"}, {"introduction": "The impact of an amino acid mutation is not fixed; it depends critically on its location and structural role.

It functions optimally at pH 7.4, but its biological role requires it to maintain structural integrity during transient exposure to acidic cellular compartments where the pH can drop to 5.0. Biophysical characterization reveals that the enzyme's denaturation at low pH is a highly specific process. The native structure at pH 7.4 is stabilized by a critical, buried salt bridge between the side chains of an Arginine at position 121 (Arg121) and an Aspartate at position 85 (Asp85). In the vicinity of this salt bridge is a Histidine residue at position 88 (His88). The local environment dictates that the pKa of the His88 side chain is 6.5.\n\nAt pH 7.4, His88 is predominantly neutral and packs favorably within the protein core. However, as the pH drops to 5.0, His88 becomes protonated. The resulting positive charge on the His88 side chain introduces a strong electrostatic repulsion with the positively charged side chain of Arg121. This repulsion is sufficient to break the Arg121-Asp85 salt bridge, triggering a conformational cascade that leads to the unfolding and inactivation of the enzyme.\n\nA team of protein engineers aims to increase the stability of CryoAdaptase at pH 5.0.

The denaturation pathway at low $\\mathrm{pH}$ arises because His88 becomes protonated and positively charged at $\\mathrm{pH}=5.0$, introducing electrostatic repulsion with Arg121 that breaks the Arg121â€“Asp85 salt bridge.\n\nFirst, we formalize the protonation behavior of His88 using the Hendersonâ€“Hasselbalch relation. For a titratable group with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, the fraction protonated is\n$$\nf_{H^{+}}=\\frac{1}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}}.\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4>\\mathrm{p}K_{a}=6.5$, we have $10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}>1$ and thus $f_{H^{+}}$ is small; His88 is predominantly neutral at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$. Since $\\mathrm{pH}=5.0<\\mathrm{p}K_{a}=6.5$, we have $10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}<1$ and thus $f_{H^{+}}$ is large; His88 is predominantly protonated and positively charged at $\\mathrm{pH}=5.0$.\n\nElectrostatically, the interaction energy between two point charges is, up to a proportionality constant,\n$$\nE \\propto \\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{\\epsilon r},\n$$\nso like charges ($q_{1}q_{2}>0$) repel and opposite charges attract. At $\\mathrm{pH}=5.0$, His88 becomes positively charged and therefore repels Arg121, which destabilizes the Arg121â€“Asp85 salt bridge. The engineering goal is to prevent this specific repulsion while preserving the favorable salt bridge and the overall fold at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$.\n\nTherefore, an optimal single-point mutation should:\n- Remove the pH-dependent positive charge at position 88 (so that at low $\\mathrm{pH}$ no new positive charge appears near Arg121),\n- Preserve the local packing and hydrophobic character of the buried site to maintain stability at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$,\n- Avoid disrupting the existing Arg121â€“Asp85 salt bridge.\n\nEvaluate each proposed mutation:\n\nA. Arg121 to Lysine (Arg121 $\\rightarrow$ Lys). Lysine has $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ significantly greater than both $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$ and $\\mathrm{pH}=5.0$, so it remains positively charged at both $\\mathrm{pH}$ values. This does not remove the low-$\\mathrm{pH}$ repulsion with protonated His88. Moreover, Arg makes a stronger, more geometrically favorable salt bridge with Asp than Lys; replacing Arg with Lys tends to weaken the salt bridge at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$. This fails the design criteria.\n\nB. Asp85 to Glutamate (Asp85 $\\rightarrow$ Glu). Both Asp and Glu are negatively charged at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$, and this change does not address the source of denaturation: the like-charge repulsion between His88 (when protonated) and Arg121. The repulsive interaction remains, so the salt bridge can still be disrupted at low $\\mathrm{pH}$. This fails the design criteria.\n\nC. His88 to Phenylalanine (His88 $\\rightarrow$ Phe). Phenylalanine is non-ionizable in the physiological and mildly acidic $\\mathrm{pH}$ range and is hydrophobic. It is similar in size and aromatic character to histidine, thereby preserving core packing at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$ where His88 is already neutral. Crucially, at $\\mathrm{pH}=5.0$ Phe cannot become positively charged, so it eliminates the pH-dependent repulsion with Arg121 and thereby prevents breaking the Arg121â€“Asp85 salt bridge. This directly interrupts the identified denaturation pathway with minimal perturbation to the native fold and stability.\n\nD. His88 to Aspartate (His88 $\\rightarrow$ Asp). Aspartate has $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ well below $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$, so it is negatively charged at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$. Introducing a buried negative charge is typically destabilizing in a hydrophobic core and may create new electrostatics that compete with or perturb the Arg121â€“Asp85 salt bridge. At $\\mathrm{pH}=5.0$, Asp may be partially protonated, leading to complex behavior not guaranteed to prevent the original repulsion pathway while likely compromising stability at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$.

This abolishes the stabilizing salt bridge with Asp85, directly reducing stability at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$, contrary to the requirement to minimize disruption at the optimal $\\mathrm{pH}$.
