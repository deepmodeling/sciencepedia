This can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{\\text{Mass of the ion}}{\\text{Charge of the ion}}\n$$\n\nIn Electrospray Ionization (ESI) of peptides, ionization is typically achieved by adding protons. If the neutral peptide has a mass $M$ and it acquires $z$ protons to form the ion, the mass of the ion will be the sum of the mass of the neutral peptide and the total mass of the added protons. Let $m_p$ be the mass of a single proton.\n\nMass of the ion = $M + z \\cdot m_p$\n\nThe charge of the ion is simply $z$, representing the number of elementary charges (protons) added.\n\nSubstituting these into the mass-to-charge ratio equation, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{M + z \\cdot m_p}{z}\n$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Neutral monoisotopic mass, $M = 2430.5$ Da\n- Observed mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z = 487.1$\n- Mass of a proton, $m_p = 1.008$ Da\n\nOur goal is to solve the equation for the charge state, $z$.\n$$\n487.1 = \\frac{2430.5 + z \\cdot 1.008}{z}\n$$\n\nTo solve for $z$, we can first multiply both sides by $z$:\n$$\n487.1 \\cdot z = 2430.5 + 1.008 \\cdot z\n$$\n\nNext, we group the terms containing $z$ on one side of the equation:\n$$\n487.1 \\cdot z - 1.008 \\cdot z = 2430.5\n$$\n\nFactor out $z$:\n$$\nz \\cdot (487.1 - 1.008) = 2430.5\n$$\n$$\nz \\cdot (486.092) = 2430.5\n$$\n\nFinally, isolate $z$ by dividing by 486.092:\n$$\nz = \\frac{2430.5}{486.092}\n$$\n$$\nz \\approx 5.00004113\n$$\n\nSince the charge state must be an integer (representing a discrete number of protons), we can round the result to the nearest integer.
