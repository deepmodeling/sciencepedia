In a typical setup, a solution of a ligand is placed in an injection syringe and titrated into a solution of a macromolecule (e.g., a protein) in a sample cell. The instrument measures the minute amount of heat that is either released (exothermic) or absorbed (endothermic) upon each injection. The integrated heat from each injection is then plotted against the molar ratio of the total ligand to the total macromolecule in the cell to create a binding isotherm.\n\nConsider a hypothetical ITC experiment where a researcher is testing the interaction between a small molecule and a target protein. The protein is in the sample cell at a known concentration, and the small molecule is in the syringe, also at a known concentration. However, suppose that, for the buffer and temperature conditions used, there is absolutely no specific binding interaction between the small molecule and the protein. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the binding isotherm that would be generated from this experiment?\n\nA. A distinct sigmoidal curve, which plateaus as the molar ratio increases, indicating that the protein binding sites have become saturated.\n\nB.

When the integrated heat per injection $q_{i}$ is plotted against the molar ratio, the result is thus a set of points that lie nearly horizontally at a small value, reflecting only the roughly constant heat of dilution without any binding signature.\n\nThis behavior matches a nearly horizontal line of small, roughly constant signals. A sigmoidal curve with saturation (option A) requires nonzero $\\Delta H$ and changing $\\theta$ due to binding, which is absent.
