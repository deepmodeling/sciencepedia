This exercise [@problem_id:2095813] uses a thought experiment involving site-directed mutagenesis—a common technique in protein science—to illustrate how the aromatic region of the spectrum is directly tied to the presence of specific aromatic amino acids. By considering the effect of removing a tryptophan residue, you will practice connecting a protein's primary sequence to its spectral fingerprint.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a small, soluble protein named \"Protein-X\" using one-dimensional (1D) proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The $^{1}$H-NMR spectrum of the wild-type protein shows a number of distinct signals in the 'aromatic region', which is defined as the chemical shift range from 6.5 ppm to 8.5 ppm. To investigate the role of a specific tryptophan residue at position 42 (Trp42), which is located on the protein's surface, the biochemist creates a mutant version of the protein where this tryptophan is replaced by an alanine (the W42A mutant). A new 1D $^{1}$H-NMR spectrum is then acquired for the W42A mutant under identical conditions.\n\nAssuming the overall fold of the protein is not significantly perturbed by this single mutation, which of the following is the most likely and direct consequence observed in the aromatic region of the W42A mutant's spectrum compared to the wild-type spectrum?\n\nA. There will be no change in the aromatic region of the spectrum.\n\nB. Several new signals will appear in the aromatic region.\n\nC. The total number of signals in the aromatic region will decrease.\n\nD. All signals in the aromatic region will shift significantly upfield (to lower ppm values).\n\nE. All signals in the aromatic region will disappear completely.", "solution": "The one-dimensional $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$-NMR aromatic region (6.5 to 8.5 ppm) primarily contains signals from aromatic side-chain protons of residues such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and histidine. These protons are typically deshielded by the diamagnetic ring-current effect of aromatic systems, placing their resonances downfield in this region.\n\nIn the wild-type protein, the tryptophan at position 42 contributes multiple aromatic protons from its indole ring that resonate within the aromatic region. When Trp42 is replaced by alanine (which lacks an aromatic ring and has no aromatic protons), all aromatic protons from that particular side chain are removed from the spectrum.\n\nUnder the stated assumption that the overall fold is not significantly perturbed, the local environments of the remaining aromatic residues are largely preserved. Therefore:\n- There is no reason to expect the creation of new aromatic resonances, because no new aromatic protons are introduced by the mutation.\n- Global or uniform large chemical shift changes across all aromatic signals are not expected; at most, small chemical shift perturbations could occur for nearby residues, but not a concerted shift of all aromatic peaks.\n- The direct and most specific spectral consequence is the loss of the signals arising from the Trp42 indole protons that lie in the 6.5 to 8.5 ppm region, reducing the total number of signals observed in that region.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because removing an aromatic side chain removes its signals.\n- B is incorrect because no new aromatic protons are introduced.\n- C is correct because the total number of aromatic signals decreases due to loss of Trp42 resonances.\n- D is incorrect because a uniform significant upfield shift of all aromatic peaks is not implied by a single surface mutation with conserved fold.\n- E is incorrect because other aromatic residues remain and their signals persist.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and direct consequence is a decrease in the total number of signals in the aromatic region.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2095813"}, {"introduction": "A proton's chemical shift is exquisitely sensitive to its local electronic environment, making NMR a powerful tool for probing subtle structural and chemical changes. This practice problem [@problem_id:2095829] explores how the protonation state of an acidic residue, controlled by the solution's pH, influences the chemical shifts of nearby protons through inductive effects. Understanding this principle is crucial for studying enzyme mechanisms, protein stability, and ligand binding.", "problem": "A protein biochemist is investigating the structural properties of a small, synthetic peptide using one-dimensional (1D) proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The peptide sequence contains a single aspartic acid residue, which is located in a flexible region of the peptide and fully exposed to the solvent. The side chain of an aspartic acid residue consists of a methylene group ($-\\text{CH}_2-$) and a terminal carboxyl group ($-\\text{COOH}$). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the peptide backbone are designated as α-protons, and the protons on the subsequent carbon of the side chain are designated as β-protons.\n\nThe biochemist prepares two samples of the peptide, one dissolved in a buffer at pH 7.0 and the other in a buffer at pH 3.0. For the purposes of this problem, assume the pKa of the aspartic acid side chain's carboxyl group is 3.9.\n\nBased on the principles of NMR spectroscopy and the effect of protonation on the electronic environment, how is the chemical shift (δ value) of the aspartic acid's β-protons expected to change when the spectrum is compared from the pH 7.0 sample to the pH 3.0 sample?\n\nA. The chemical shift will increase (move downfield).\n\nB. The chemical shift will decrease (move upfield).\n\nC. The chemical shift will remain unchanged, as the β-protons do not directly titrate.\n\nD. The NMR signal for the β-protons will broaden and disappear completely due to the pH change.\n\nE. The chemical shift will first decrease as the pH is lowered towards the pKa, and then increase as the pH is lowered further to 3.0.", "solution": "We analyze how the chemical shift of the aspartic acid $\\beta$-protons depends on the protonation state of the side-chain carboxyl group by combining acid–base equilibria with NMR shielding principles.\n\nFirst, determine the predominant protonation state at each pH using the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation for the side-chain carboxyl group:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH}=\\mathrm{p}K_{a}+\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}\\right).\n$$\nWhen $\\mathrm{pH}>\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, one has $[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]/[\\mathrm{HA}]=10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}>1$, so the deprotonated carboxylate $\\text{COO}^{-}$ predominates. When $\\mathrm{pH}<\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, one has $[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]/[\\mathrm{HA}]=10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}<1$, so the protonated carboxylic acid $\\text{COOH}$ predominates. Therefore, at pH $7.0$ the side chain is predominantly $\\text{COO}^{-}$, while at pH $3.0$ it is predominantly $\\text{COOH}$.\n\nNext, connect protonation to chemical shift. The observed proton chemical shift $\\delta$ increases (moves downfield) as local electron shielding decreases. Formally, if $\\sigma$ is the shielding constant, then a decrease in $\\sigma$ yields an increase in $\\delta$. The electronic effect of the side-chain group on the adjacent $\\beta$-carbon is as follows:\n- In the deprotonated state $\\text{COO}^{-}$, the negative charge is delocalized over the oxygens and, via inductive and resonance effects, the adjacent $\\beta$-carbon experiences relatively higher electron density, i.e., greater shielding. Denote this shielding by $\\sigma_{\\beta}^{-}$.\n- In the protonated state $\\text{COOH}$, the group exerts a stronger net electron-withdrawing effect on the adjacent $\\beta$-carbon, reducing electron density and thus shielding. Denote this by $\\sigma_{\\beta}^{0}$.\n\nThus one expects $\\sigma_{\\beta}^{0}<\\sigma_{\\beta}^{-}$, which implies $\\delta_{\\beta}^{0}>\\delta_{\\beta}^{-}$. Consequently, when the sample is changed from pH $7.0$ (mostly $\\text{COO}^{-}$) to pH $3.0$ (mostly $\\text{COOH}$), the $\\beta$-protons become more deshielded and their chemical shift increases (moves downfield).\n\nThis change is monotonic across the titration (the observed $\\delta$ is the population-weighted average of the limiting shifts and tracks the protonation fraction), so there is no nonmonotonic behavior. The $\\beta$-protons themselves are not exchangeable and therefore do not disappear; substantial line broadening to the point of complete loss is not expected under these conditions for a small, flexible peptide in 1D proton NMR.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that the chemical shift increases (moves downfield) from pH $7.0$ to pH $3.0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2095829"}, {"introduction": "Beyond local effects, the overall three-dimensional and quaternary structure of a protein profoundly shapes its NMR spectrum.

In its native state under specific buffer conditions (Condition M), Monopro exists as a stable monomer.

The spectrum will show two sharp signals for Trp-15 and Trp-94, and two very broad signals for Trp-32 and Trp-58 due to their location at the interface.", "solution": "1) Identify the relevant NMR principles.\n- Chemical shift reflects the local electronic environment; residues at a new interface commonly undergo significant chemical shift perturbations due to changes in hydrogen bonding, ring-current effects, desolvation, and proximity to binding partners.\n- In a symmetric homodimer, residues related by the symmetry operation are chemically equivalent and contribute a single resonance per residue type (per unique position), not one per subunit.\n- Slow exchange on the NMR timescale means separate resonances are observed for distinct states; however, under Condition D the protein is a highly stable dimer, so the observed spectrum corresponds to the dimer state only (no time-averaging with the monomer).\n- Line width is determined by molecular tumbling and local exchange; without evidence of site-specific exchange broadening at the interface, one does not selectively broaden only interface residues.\n\n2) Apply symmetry and count expected signals.\n- The dimer is symmetric; Trp-15 in chain A and Trp-15 in chain B are chemically equivalent and produce one resonance. The same equivalence applies to Trp-32, Trp-58, and Trp-94 across the two subunits.\n- Therefore, the number of distinct Trp indole N-H signals in the dimer is four, not eight (reject option B) and not two (reject option A).\n\n3) Predict chemical shift perturbations upon dimerization.\n- Trp-32 and Trp-58 participate directly in the interface; their environments change substantially relative to the monomer, so their indole N-H chemical shifts should be significantly perturbed compared to Condition M.\n- Trp-15 and Trp-94 are solvent-exposed and far from the interface, and the problem states no major conformational change except at the interface. Thus, their environments should remain similar to the monomer, leading to minimal chemical shift changes.\n\n4) Evaluate the remaining options against these predictions.\n- Option C (spectrum identical to monomer) is inconsistent because interface residues must shift.\n- Option E (two sharp plus two very broad interface signals) is not supported by the given assumptions; selective broadening at only the interface is not implied, and slow exchange refers to monomer-dimer interconversion (which is not observed in D due to stability), not to site-specific exchange within the dimer. Absent evidence of local exchange at the interface, significant broadening specifically for Trp-32 and Trp-58 is not justified.\n\n5) Conclusion.\n- The dimer spectrum should show four distinct signals, with significant chemical shift changes for the two interface residues (Trp-32 and Trp-58), while the two surface residues (Trp-15 and Trp-94) remain similar to the monomer.
