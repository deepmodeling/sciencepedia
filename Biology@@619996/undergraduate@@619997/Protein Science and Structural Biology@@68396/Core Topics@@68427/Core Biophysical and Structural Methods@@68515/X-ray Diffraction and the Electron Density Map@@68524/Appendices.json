The next crucial step is to interpret this map by fitting the known amino acid sequence of the protein into the corresponding density. This practice problem hones a fundamental skill in model building: learning to distinguish between different amino acid residues based on the size and shape of their electron density, a task that is essential for building an accurate initial model [@problem_id:2150898].", "problem": "In a structural biology lab, you are interpreting an electron density map for a protein, calculated from X-ray diffraction data to a resolution of 2.0 Ångströms (Å). During the process of fitting the amino acid sequence into the map, you must assign a residue to a particular region of density. The protein's primary sequence indicates that this residue is either an alanine (Ala) or a tryptophan (Trp).\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describe the key features within the electron density map that would allow you to distinguish between an alanine side chain and a tryptophan side chain at this position?\n\nA. The volume of electron density corresponding to the tryptophan side chain would be significantly larger than that for the alanine side chain.\n\nB. The electron density for the tryptophan side chain would exhibit a distinct, planar, ring-like shape, whereas the density for alanine's side chain would be small and roughly spherical.\n\nC. The peak value of electron density (measured in electrons/Å³) within the side chain region would be identical for both residues, as the map is globally normalized.\n\nD. A resolution of 2.0 Å is too low to distinguish the shapes of any side chains, so the assignment must be based on other factors entirely.\n\nE. The alanine side chain would appear as a forked or branched density, while the tryptophan side chain would appear as a long, unbranched chain.", "solution": "We base the interpretation on how electron density maps arise from X-ray diffraction and how resolution constrains observable features. The electron density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ is reconstructed from structure factors and phases, and at typical practice is displayed as a contour map. At identical occupancy and similar atomic displacement parameters (B-factors), residues with more electrons and more atoms produce larger contiguous volumes of density and more distinctive shapes. Global map normalization commonly rescales $\\rho$ to have a chosen mean and standard deviation, but this does not equalize the local peak heights for different residues; local peak height depends on the number of electrons, atomic displacement, and model agreement.\n\nAt a resolution of $2.0$ angstroms, side-chain shapes are generally resolvable for standard amino acids, especially aromatic residues, whose planar ring systems are distinctive. Aromatic rings (such as the indole of tryptophan) typically appear as planar, ring-like densities; small aliphatic groups (such as alanine’s methyl group) appear as compact, roughly spherical blobs.\n\nEvaluate each statement:\n- A. True. Tryptophan has many more electrons and a much larger side chain than alanine. Consequently, the integrated side-chain density and visible volume for tryptophan would be significantly larger than for alanine, assuming similar occupancy and B-factors.\n- B. True. Tryptophan’s indole ring system yields a distinct, planar, ring-like density, while alanine’s side chain is a single methyl group that appears as a small, roughly spherical density near the $C_{\\alpha}$.\n- C. False. Although maps may be normalized so that $\\rho$ has a set mean and standard deviation, the peak value of density in a local region depends on electron count, occupancy, and B-factors; it is not identical for different residues.\n- D. False. A resolution of $2.0$ angstroms is sufficient to distinguish side-chain shapes, particularly to recognize aromatic rings versus small aliphatic groups.\n- E. False. Alanine’s side chain is not forked or branched; it is a single methyl group. Tryptophan does not appear as a long, unbranched chain; it is characterized by fused aromatic rings.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are A and B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2150898"}, {"introduction": "Building a protein model is an iterative process of refinement and validation.

A single ordered water molecule can produce a positive peak, but waters are small scatterers and typically produce modest peaks, with many such peaks appearing throughout the map rather than one uniquely strong peak. A “single, strong” peak localized in the active site is more consistent with a heavier or larger ligand than with a solitary water.\n\nB. A misidentified side chain that should be a larger residue would usually produce a pattern of both positive and negative difference density: positive where extra atoms should be, and negative where the current (too-small) side chain is modeled. Moreover, such density would generally be contiguous with the protein model rather than not overlapping it at all. The problem specifies no spatial overlap, arguing against this.\n\nC. An incorrectly modeled backbone segment would produce an extended series of alternating positive and negative features along the misplaced chain trace, not a single isolated, well-defined peak.\n\nD. A molecule from the crystallization buffer, a cofactor, a metal ion, or a substrate analog bound in the active site commonly appears as a strong, localized positive difference peak when omitted from the model. The active site is the expected location for such binding, and a single, strong, well-defined positive feature is characteristic of an unmodeled ligand or bound small molecule.\n\nE. Random noise typically leads to weak, poorly defined, and non-reproducible features, not a single strong and well-resolved peak centered in a chemically meaningful site such as the active site.\n\nTherefore, by the definition of the $F_{o}-F_{c}$ map and the characteristic signatures of missing density, the most probable identity of the unmodeled density is a bound small molecule from the crystallization condition or an endogenous/analog ligand in the active site, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2107371"}]}
