A crucial step in this process is sample preparation by vitrification, where a thin film of the protein solution is rapidly frozen on a grid, trapping the particles in amorphous ice.\n\nConsider a sample of the protein aldolase being prepared for cryo-EM. The protein solution has an initial concentration $C$. This solution is applied to a cryo-EM grid, which has circular holes of diameter $D$. After blotting away excess liquid, a thin film of the solution remains suspended across these holes. This film is then vitrified, forming a solid layer of amorphous ice with a uniform thickness $h$.\n\nAssuming the protein molecules are distributed uniformly throughout the solution and their individual volumes are negligible, calculate the expected number of aldolase particles that would be found within the cylindrical volume of ice in a single grid hole.\n\nUse the following parameters for your calculation:\n- Protein concentration, $C = 2.50 \\, \\text{mg/mL}$\n- Molecular weight of aldolase, $M_w = 1.58 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{g/mol}$\n- Diameter of the grid hole, $D = 1.20 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$\n- Thickness of the vitrified ice layer, $h = 50.0 \\, \\text{nm}$\n- Avogadro's constant, $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\, \\text{mol}^{-1}$\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Because the molecules are uniformly distributed and individual molecular volumes are negligible, the expected number of particles equals the molecular number density times the volume.

This exercise focuses on interpreting a classic visual artifact: particles that present with unusually high contrast and are surrounded by a distinct bright halo. Understanding the underlying principles of image formation will allow you to correctly identify this as a symptom of the ice being too thin [@problem_id:2135229], a frequent problem stemming from the blotting process.", "problem": "A structural biology student is learning to prepare samples for cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM), a technique used to determine the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules. The student flash-freezes a grid coated with a purified protein sample, aiming to create a thin layer of vitrified (non-crystalline) ice.\n\nUpon inserting the grid into the electron microscope for initial screening, the student observes that a vast majority of the individual protein particles across the grid exhibit two distinct characteristics: they possess an unusually high contrast against the background, and each particle is surrounded by a stark, bright \"halo.\"\n\nBased on these specific visual artifacts, what is the most probable issue with the sample preparation, specifically concerning the ice layer?\n\nA. The vitrified ice layer is excessively thick, leading to a high degree of inelastic scattering which amplifies the signal from the particles.\n\nB. The protein sample was too concentrated, causing particles to stack on top of each other and create interference patterns.\n\nC. The vitrification process failed, and the water formed crystalline ice instead of amorphous ice.\n\nD. The vitrified ice layer is critically thin, to the point of being absent around the particles, leaving them partially or fully exposed to the microscope's vacuum.\n\nE. The microscope was operated with a very large defocus value, which is known to artificially enhance the contrast of all features in the image.", "solution": "We interpret the imaging contrast in cryo-EM using standard phase-contrast TEM principles. For a weak-phase object (a protein) embedded in vitreous ice, the image contrast arises from the contrast transfer function acting on the projected electrostatic potential. If the embedding medium is vitreous ice of suitable thickness, proteins typically show low intrinsic contrast without strong halos.\n\nWe evaluate each option against known physical and imaging behaviors.\n\n1) If the ice is excessively thick (Option A), the transmitted intensity follows Beer–Lambert-like attenuation, $I = I_{0}\\exp(-t/\\lambda_{\\text{inel}})$, where $t$ is thickness and $\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}$ is the inelastic mean free path. Increasing $t$ increases inelastic scattering and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and apparent contrast of the particles. Thus, thick ice produces low contrast and a foggy background, not unusually high particle contrast or sharp, bright halos around each particle. Therefore A is inconsistent with the observation.\n\n2) If the protein is too concentrated (Option B), one expects overlapping particles, aggregation, or preferred orientation crowding, but not a uniform bright halo around each particle. Overlap does not create consistent, particle-specific bright halos; cryo-EM images are not typically coherent enough to produce stable “interference patterns” from stacking that would manifest as halos around each single particle across the grid. Therefore B does not match the specific artifact described.\n\n3) If vitrification failed and crystalline ice formed (Option C), one expects crystalline features: in real space, faceted crystals or strong texture, and in Fourier space, Bragg spots or rings at the characteristic spacings of hexagonal ice. The dominant artifact is crystalline ice patterns across the field rather than a bright halo around each protein particle. The description of “each particle is surrounded by a stark, bright halo” is not the signature of crystalline ice. Therefore C is not the best match.\n\n4) If the ice is critically thin or absent around particles (Option D), the local environment of a particle transitions from protein-in-ice to protein-at-vacuum. The phase shift at an interface drives edge contrast under defocused phase-contrast imaging via Fresnel diffraction. Under defocus $\\Delta f$, the contrast transfer function is\n$$\n\\text{CTF}(k) = -\\sin\\!\\big(\\pi \\lambda \\Delta f\\, k^{2} + \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}C_{s}\\lambda^{3}k^{4} + \\phi\\big),\n$$\nwhere $k$ is spatial frequency, $\\lambda$ is the electron wavelength, $C_{s}$ is spherical aberration, and $\\phi$ is any additional phase shift. A larger potential (index) step at the boundary yields stronger edge-enhanced contrast. The jump from vacuum to protein is larger than from vitreous ice to protein, so particles partially or fully exposed to vacuum display unusually high contrast and pronounced bright (or dark, depending on defocus sign) halos due to edge enhancement. The observation of a “stark, bright ‘halo’” around most particles, along with unusually high particle contrast, is a classic indicator that the ice is too thin or missing locally, leaving particles exposed or protruding. Therefore D matches both features described.\n\n5) Large defocus (Option E) increases low-frequency contrast globally via the CTF, but it affects all features, not specifically particles, and typically produces alternating bright/dark fringes depending on the CTF phase. While defocus can cause edge fringes, it would not selectively cause stark bright halos specifically around each particle while simultaneously implying unusually high intrinsic particle contrast unless there is a strong potential step at the particle boundary (as in D). Moreover, with large defocus the background, edges of holes, and contamination also exhibit strong halos, not isolated to particles. Thus E alone does not best explain the combination of observations.\n\nBy elimination using the physical mechanisms of scattering, attenuation, and phase-contrast edge enhancement, the only option that directly explains both unusually high particle contrast and a bright halo around each particle is that the ice is critically thin or absent around the particles, exposing them to vacuum.\n\nTherefore, the most probable issue is Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2135229"}, {"introduction": "Some critical sample defects are not immediately obvious from a simple visual inspection of the micrograph.
