Electrons that pass through the sample without scattering or by scattering elastically contribute to a high-resolution image. However, electrons can also scatter inelastically, losing energy and contributing to background noise, which degrades the final image quality.\n\nThe probability that an electron travels a distance $x$ through the vitrified ice without undergoing an inelastic scattering event can be modeled by the equation $P_{\\text{unscattered}}(x) = \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the inelastic mean free path of the electron in the material.\n\nConsider a 300 keV electron beam passing through a particularly thick region of a vitrified ice sample.

This thought experiment investigates the artifacts that arise from incorrectly enforcing a higher symmetry ($C4$) on a complex that only possesses a lower symmetry ($C2$).

When a molecule possesses rotational symmetry, this averaging can be extended to include different rotational views of the same particle, a process known as symmetry enforcement. However, imposing an incorrect symmetry can lead to significant artifacts in the final three-dimensional map.\n\nA structural biology research group is studying a newly isolated tetrameric protein complex. An initial, high-quality, asymmetric (C1) reconstruction reveals that the complex consists of four identical subunits. The centers of mass of these subunits lie in a single plane and form a rectangle. Relative to the center of the complex at the origin $(0,0,0)$, the subunit centers are located at coordinates $(\\pm L, \\pm W, 0)$, where $L$ and $W$ are positive constants with $L > W$. The rotational symmetry axis of the complex is the z-axis. We can model the electron density of each subunit as a localized distribution with a peak value of $\\rho_0$.\n\nA researcher on the team hypothesizes that the complex might possess 4-fold (C4) rotational symmetry. To test this, they generate a C4-symmetrized density map, $\\rho_{C4}$, by computationally averaging the asymmetric (C1) map. The C4-symmetrized map is defined as the average of the C1 map and the C1 map rotated by 90, 180, and 270 degrees about the z-axis.\n\nTo visualize the consequence of imposing this potentially incorrect symmetry, a difference map is calculated: $\\rho_{diff} = \\rho_{C1} - \\rho_{C4}$.
