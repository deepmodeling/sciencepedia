Globulin-X is known to adopt a compact, nearly spherical (globular) conformation in solution. In contrast, Fibrillin-Y is a structural protein that forms a highly elongated, rod-like shape.\n\nAn investigator plans to perform a Sedimentation Velocity Analytical Ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) experiment on separate samples of each protein, under identical buffer conditions (solvent density $\\rho$) and temperature.
