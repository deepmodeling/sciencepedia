This fundamental skill is crucial for interpreting real Patterson maps derived from experimental data.", "problem": "In the field of X-ray crystallography, a Patterson map provides crucial information for solving the phase problem, especially when dealing with structures containing heavy atoms or known molecular fragments. A Patterson map is calculated from the experimentally measured diffraction intensities and its peaks correspond to the set of all interatomic vectors within the crystal's unit cell.\n\nConsider a hypothetical homodimeric protein, Dimerin, which crystallizes in the space group P1 (i.e., with no symmetry operations other than lattice translations) in an orthorhombic unit cell with dimensions $a, b, c$. Each unit cell contains exactly one Dimerin molecule. The two identical monomers that form the dimer, M1 and M2, are related to each other by a single, pure translation vector $\\vec{T} = (\\frac{a}{2}, 0, 0)$.\n\nLet the complete set of non-zero, intra-monomer vectors (i.e., vectors from one atom to another atom within the same monomer) be denoted by the set $\\mathcal{V}_{intra}$. These vectors, along with their centrosymmetric counterparts, define the \"self-Patterson\" of a single monomer. Based on this information, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected pattern of non-origin peaks in the native Patterson map computed from the Dimerin crystal?\n\nA. The non-origin peaks are found only at positions corresponding to the vectors in $\\mathcal{V}_{intra}$ and their inverses.\n\nB. The map contains two clusters of peaks: one centered at the vector position $\\vec{T}$ and an identical, inverted cluster centered at $-\\vec{T}$.\n\nC. The only non-origin peaks are a single strong peak at the position $\\vec{T}$ and its centrosymmetric partner at $-\\vec{T}$.\n\nD. The non-origin peaks are distributed in three main clusters. One cluster is centered at the origin $(0,0,0)$ and corresponds to vectors in $\\mathcal{V}_{intra}$. A second, identical cluster is centered at $\\vec{T}$. A third, centrosymmetrically-related cluster is centered at $-\\vec{T}$.\n\nE. The Patterson map is completely uniform except for the origin peak, because the translational relationship between the monomers causes all interatomic vector contributions to destructively interfere.", "solution": "The Patterson function, $P(\\vec{u})$, gives the distribution of interatomic vectors within the unit cell. It can be defined as the auto-correlation of the electron density, $\\rho(\\vec{r})$:\n$$P(\\vec{u}) = \\int_{\\text{unit cell}} \\rho(\\vec{r}) \\rho(\\vec{r}+\\vec{u}) d\\vec{r}$$\nA peak at a position $\\vec{u}$ in the Patterson map indicates that there is a pair of atoms in the unit cell separated by the vector $\\vec{u}$.\n\nIn this problem, the total electron density in the unit cell, $\\rho_{cell}(\\vec{r})$, is the sum of the electron densities of the two monomers, M1 and M2. Let's denote the electron density of monomer M1 as $\\rho_1(\\vec{r})$. Since monomer M2 is a translated copy of M1 by the vector $\\vec{T}$, its electron density, $\\rho_2(\\vec{r})$, can be written in terms of $\\rho_1(\\vec{r})$:\n$$\\rho_2(\\vec{r}) = \\rho_1(\\vec{r}-\\vec{T})$$\nThe total electron density is:\n$$\\rho_{cell}(\\vec{r}) = \\rho_1(\\vec{r}) + \\rho_2(\\vec{r}) = \\rho_1(\\vec{r}) + \\rho_1(\\vec{r}-\\vec{T})$$\n\nThe Patterson function is the auto-correlation (or, equivalently, the convolution with the inverted function) of the total electron density:\n$$P(\\vec{u}) = \\rho_{cell}(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_{cell}(-\\vec{r})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\rho_{cell}(\\vec{r})$:\n$$P(\\vec{u}) = [\\rho_1(\\vec{r}) + \\rho_2(\\vec{r})] * [\\rho_1(-\\vec{r}) + \\rho_2(-\\vec{r})]$$\nUsing the distributive property of convolution, we can expand this into four terms:\n$$P(\\vec{u}) = [\\rho_1(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_1(-\\vec{r})] + [\\rho_2(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_2(-\\vec{r})] + [\\rho_1(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_2(-\\vec{r})] + [\\rho_2(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_1(-\\vec{r})]$$\n\nLet's analyze each term:\n\n1.  **Term 1: $\\rho_1(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_1(-\\vec{r})$**\n    This is the auto-correlation of monomer M1 with itself. The peaks of this function correspond to all the intra-monomer vectors within M1. This set of vectors is exactly what the problem defines as the \"self-Patterson\" of the monomer, which includes the vectors in $\\mathcal{V}_{intra}$ and their inverses. This cluster of peaks is centered at the origin $\\vec{u}=(0,0,0)$ of the Patterson map.\n\n2.  **Term 2: $\\rho_2(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_2(-\\vec{r})$**\n    This is the auto-correlation of monomer M2 with itself. Since M2 is identical to M1, this term produces the exact same set of peaks as Term 1, also centered at the origin. Therefore, the peaks corresponding to intra-monomer vectors are superimposed and strengthened.\n\n3.  **Term 3: $\\rho_1(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_2(-\\vec{r})$**\n    This \"cross-Patterson\" term corresponds to vectors pointing from an atom in M2 to an atom in M1. Let $\\vec{r}_j$ be the position of an atom in M1 and $\\vec{r}_k$ be the position of an atom in M2. The corresponding Patterson peak is at $\\vec{u} = \\vec{r}_j - \\vec{r}_k$. Since M2 is a translated copy of M1, we can write $\\vec{r}_k = \\vec{r}_{k'} + \\vec{T}$, where $\\vec{r}_{k'}$ is the position of the equivalent atom in M1.\n    Substituting this, we get $\\vec{u} = \\vec{r}_j - (\\vec{r}_{k'} + \\vec{T}) = (\\vec{r}_j - \\vec{r}_{k'}) - \\vec{T}$.\n    The term $(\\vec{r}_j - \\vec{r}_{k'})$ represents an intra-monomer vector (a vector within the reference frame of M1). The set of all such vectors is the self-Patterson of the monomer. Therefore, this entire collection of cross-vectors is the set of all intra-monomer vectors shifted by $-\\vec{T}$. This forms a cluster of peaks identical to the self-Patterson, but centered at $\\vec{u}=-\\vec{T}$.\n\n4.  **Term 4: $\\rho_2(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_1(-\\vec{r})$**\n    This cross-Patterson term corresponds to vectors pointing from an atom in M1 to an atom in M2. Let $\\vec{r}_j$ be in M2 and $\\vec{r}_k$ be in M1. A peak is at $\\vec{u} = \\vec{r}_j - \\vec{r}_k$.\n    We can write $\\vec{r}_j = \\vec{r}_{j'} + \\vec{T}$, where $\\vec{r}_{j'}$ is the equivalent atom in M1.\n    Substituting this gives $\\vec{u} = (\\vec{r}_{j'} + \\vec{T}) - \\vec{r}_k = (\\vec{r}_{j'} - \\vec{r}_k) + \\vec{T}$.\n    Similar to the previous case, the term $(\\vec{r}_{j'} - \\vec{r}_k)$ represents an intra-monomer vector. The full set of these cross-vectors is the set of all intra-monomer vectors shifted by $+\\vec{T}$. This forms another cluster of peaks identical to the self-Patterson, but centered at $\\vec{u}=+\\vec{T}$.\n\n**Summary of Peak Locations:**\n-   **Intra-monomer vectors (Terms 1 & 2):** A cluster of peaks corresponding to the monomer self-Patterson ($\\mathcal{V}_{intra}$ and its inverse), centered at the origin $(0,0,0)$.\n-   **Inter-monomer vectors M1 $\\rightarrow$ M2 (Term 4):** A copy of the monomer self-Patterson, where the entire cluster is shifted to be centered at $\\vec{T} = (\\frac{a}{2}, 0, 0)$. These are often called Harker peaks in cases with crystallographic symmetry, but here they arise from non-crystallographic symmetry.\n-   **Inter-monomer vectors M2 $\\rightarrow$ M1 (Term 3):** A copy of the monomer self-Patterson, where the entire cluster is shifted to be centered at $-\\vec{T} = (-\\frac{a}{2}, 0, 0)$.\n\nThus, the Patterson map contains three distinct clusters of peaks, all exhibiting the same internal pattern of the monomer's self-Patterson. One is at the origin, one at $\\vec{T}$, and one at $-\\vec{T}$.\n\nComparing this to the options:\n-   A is incorrect as it ignores the inter-monomer (cross-Patterson) vectors.\n-   B is incorrect as it ignores the intra-monomer (self-Patterson) vectors centered at the origin.\n-   C is incorrect as it falsely simplifies the cross-Patterson to a single peak. The cross-Patterson is a whole set of peaks.\n-   D correctly describes the three clusters: the self-Patterson at the origin, and two cross-Patterson clusters shifted by $\\vec{T}$ and $-\\vec{T}$. A Patterson map is always centrosymmetric, so the cluster at $-\\vec{T}$ is centrosymmetrically related to the one at $\\vec{T}$. Since the monomer self-Patterson is itself centrosymmetric, all three clusters of peaks are actually identical.\n-   E is incorrect; the vectors add constructively to form distinct features.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the most accurate description.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2145243"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of inter-atomic vectors, this practice explores how crystallographic symmetry can be exploited to pinpoint the location of heavy atoms.

The crystals are found to belong to the monoclinic space group $P2_1$. The symmetry operation for this space group relates an atom at fractional coordinates $(x, y, z)$ to a symmetry-equivalent atom at $(-x, y + 1/2, -z)$ within the unit cell. To solve the structure, a heavy-atom derivative is prepared by soaking the crystal in a solution containing mercury. After collecting diffraction data from both the native and derivative crystals, a difference Patterson map, denoted as $P(u, v, w)$, is calculated.

This section directly reveals the electron density of the mercury atom at its coordinates $(x_H, y_H, z_H)$, where the screw axis forces its $y_H$ coordinate to be $1/2$.\n\nB.
