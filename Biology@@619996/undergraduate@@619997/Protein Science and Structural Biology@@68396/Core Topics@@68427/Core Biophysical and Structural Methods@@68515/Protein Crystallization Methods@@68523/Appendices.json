This practice is essential for building an intuition about how to manipulate solution conditions to achieve the desired outcome.", "problem": "A researcher is attempting to crystallize a newly purified protein for structural studies. The protein is initially dissolved in a solution containing a buffer to maintain a pH of 7.4 and a salt, ammonium sulfate, at a concentration of 0.5 M. It is known that for this protein, crystallization is favored under conditions of high protein concentration and high salt concentration.\n\nThe experimental setup involves placing 1 mL of this protein solution into a dialysis bag. The dialysis membrane has a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) specifically chosen to be much smaller than the molecular weight of the protein, but large enough to allow free passage of water molecules, buffer components, and ammonium sulfate ions. This sealed dialysis bag is then submerged into a very large, well-stirred reservoir containing 5 liters of pure, deionized water.\n\nThe objective of the experiment is to induce the formation of protein crystals. Based on the principles of thermodynamics and mass transport, which of the following statements most accurately explains the outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. The high concentration of protein inside the bag will create a strong osmotic pressure, drawing water out of the bag, concentrating the protein and salt further, and leading to rapid, amorphous precipitation instead of ordered crystals.\n\nB. The dialysis membrane will become clogged by the protein molecules, preventing any exchange with the external solution and thus leaving the conditions inside the bag unchanged, so no crystallization will occur.\n\nC. The ammonium sulfate and buffer salts will diffuse out of the dialysis bag, while water diffuses in, causing both the protein and salt concentrations inside the bag to decrease. This leads to an increase in protein solubility, moving the system away from the conditions required for crystallization.\n\nD. The large volume of pure water will rapidly neutralize the buffer inside the bag, causing a drastic pH shift that denatures the protein, making it unable to form an ordered crystalline lattice.\n\nE. The protein molecules will slowly diffuse through the membrane pores into the external reservoir, lowering the protein concentration inside the bag to a point where crystallization is impossible.", "solution": "We identify which species can cross the membrane and what thermodynamic forces drive transport. The dialysis membrane has a molecular weight cut-off much smaller than the protein’s molecular weight, so the protein is non-permeant, while water, buffer components, and ammonium sulfate are permeant. For each permeant species $i$, equilibrium across the membrane requires equality of chemical potentials:\n$$\n\\mu_{i}^{\\text{in}}=\\mu_{i}^{\\text{out}},\\quad \\mu_{i}=\\mu_{i}^{0}+RT\\ln a_{i}.\n$$\nWith a very large, well-stirred external reservoir of pure water, the external activities $a_{i}^{\\text{out}}$ of buffer ions and ammonium sulfate are maintained near zero. The only way to approach $\\mu_{i}^{\\text{in}}=\\mu_{i}^{\\text{out}}$ is for $a_{i}^{\\text{in}}$ to decrease toward $a_{i}^{\\text{out}}$. This decrease occurs kinetically by diffusion driven by concentration gradients. For a permeant solute of concentration $c(x,t)$, Fick’s law gives the flux $J_{i}=-D_{i}\\nabla c_{i}$. Because $c_{i}^{\\text{out}}\\approx 0$, the net flux is outward and the total moles inside decay approximately as\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{i}}{dt}\\approx -k_{i}N_{i}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad N_{i}(t)=N_{i}(0)\\exp(-k_{i}t)\\to 0,\n$$\nwhere $k_{i}$ encapsulates membrane area, thickness, and diffusivity. Thus the internal concentrations of ammonium sulfate and buffer salts decrease over time.\n\nWater flow is governed by osmotic and hydrostatic pressure differences. The volumetric flux can be written as\n$$\nJ_{w}=L_{p}\\left(\\Delta P-\\Delta\\Pi\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the hydrostatic pressure difference (inside minus outside) and $\\Delta\\Pi$ is the osmotic pressure difference. Only non-permeant solutes sustain an osmotic pressure; to leading order (van ’t Hoff),\n$$\n\\Pi\\approx RT\\sum_{j\\in \\text{non-permeant}} c_{j}.\n$$\nSince salts and buffer ions are permeant, their contributions to $\\Delta\\Pi$ vanish as they dialyze out. The protein is non-permeant, so initially $\\Delta\\Pi\\approx RT\\,c_{p}$, where $c_{p}=n_{p}/V$ with $n_{p}$ the fixed moles of protein. With $\\Delta P$ initially small, water enters the bag (from lower to higher osmotic pressure), increasing $V(t)$ until either a small $\\Delta P$ develops or $c_{p}$ is reduced by dilution, decreasing $\\Delta\\Pi$. In either case, $c_{p}(t)=n_{p}/V(t)$ decreases relative to the initial value.\n\nCombining these effects:\n- Ammonium sulfate and buffer ions diffuse out, so their internal concentrations decrease due to both loss of moles and dilution.\n- Water diffuses in, increasing the internal volume and decreasing the protein concentration because $n_{p}$ is constant but $V$ increases.\nTherefore both salt concentration and protein concentration decrease. Because crystallization of this protein is favored by high protein concentration and high salt concentration, the system is driven away from the crystallization region of the phase diagram.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect: osmotic water flow is into, not out of, the bag, and salts are permeant, so they do not build up; the direction and mechanism asserted are wrong.\n- B is incorrect: the membrane is designed to exclude protein while permitting small solutes; clogging is not implied and exchange will occur.\n- C is correct: permeant salts diffuse out and water diffuses in, decreasing both salt and protein concentrations and increasing protein solubility, moving away from crystallization conditions.\n- D is incorrect: pure water does not “neutralize” the buffer; buffer components dialyze out together, and the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation, $pH=pK_{a}+\\log_{10}([A^{-}]/[HA])$, shows the ratio (and thus pH) is not driven to a drastic shift by pure water; denaturation is not the expected dominant outcome.\n- E is incorrect: the MWCO is chosen below the protein’s size, so protein does not diffuse out.\n\nThus the most accurate explanation is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2126750"}, {"introduction": "The hanging-drop vapor diffusion method is a cornerstone of modern protein crystallography, relying on the gentle equilibration of water between a protein droplet and a larger reservoir. This practice challenges you to predict the outcome of a common experimental error, forcing a deeper look at the underlying principle: water activity ($a_w$) and its relationship to vapor pressure ($p_w$). Mastering this concept is key to designing and troubleshooting your own crystallization experiments, ensuring you can precisely control the path to supersaturation [@problem_id:2126767].", "problem": "A student is attempting to crystallize a protein using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. They prepare a sealed chamber containing a large reservoir solution. The reservoir solution consists of 1.0 M sodium chloride. For the experiment, they mix their purified protein with a crystallization buffer to create a small drop on a siliconized coverslip, which is then inverted and suspended over the reservoir. Due to a mistake in preparing the buffer, the final concentration of sodium chloride in the protein drop is 2.5 M.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary change that will occur to the protein drop over the first few hours, assuming the chamber remains perfectly sealed and at a constant temperature?\n\nA. The volume of the drop will decrease as water evaporates from the drop and condenses into the reservoir, concentrating the protein.\n\nB. The volume of the drop will increase as water evaporates from the reservoir and condenses into the drop, making the protein solution more dilute.\n\nC. The volume of the drop will remain unchanged because the system is sealed, preventing any net movement of water between the drop and the reservoir.\n\nD. Salt from the drop will be transported through the vapor phase to the reservoir until the salt concentrations are equal, with no significant change in drop volume.\n\nE. The protein in the drop will rapidly denature and precipitate due to the incorrect salt concentration, while the drop volume remains constant.", "solution": "Define the water chemical potential in each phase and use equilibrium conditions to determine the direction of water transfer. For water in an ideal (or activity-accounted) solution at temperature $T$, the chemical potential in the liquid is\n$$\n\\mu_{w}^{(l)}=\\mu_{w}^{\\circ}(l)+RT\\ln a_{w},\n$$\nand in the vapor it is\n$$\n\\mu_{w}^{(g)}=\\mu_{w}^{\\circ}(g)+RT\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{w}}{p^{\\circ}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $a_{w}$ is the water activity in the solution, $p_{w}$ is the partial pressure of water vapor, $p^{\\circ}$ is a standard pressure, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

Thus, higher solute concentration lowers $a_{w}$ and therefore lowers $p_{w}^{\\text{eq}}$.\n\nLet the reservoir be subscript $r$ and the drop be subscript $d$.

The drop is then exposed to a vapor partial pressure $p_{w}$ satisfying\n$$\np_{w} \\approx p_{w,r}^{\\text{eq}} > p_{w,d}^{\\text{eq}}.\n$$\nWhen the ambient vapor pressure exceeds the equilibrium vapor pressure over the drop, the chemical potential of water in the vapor above the drop is higher than that required for equilibrium with the drop, so net condensation occurs onto the drop. Equivalently, there is net water transfer from the reservoir to the drop via the vapor phase.\n\nTherefore, the primary change over the first few hours is an increase in the drop volume, which dilutes the protein solution. Salt transport through the vapor is negligible because the salt is nonvolatile, so there is no direct salt transfer through the gas phase. The system being sealed does not prevent redistribution of water between the reservoir and drop; it only prevents net loss or gain of water from the chamber as a whole. Any curvature (Kelvin) effects alter $p_{w}^{\\text{eq}}$ by a factor $\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\gamma V_{m}}{rRT}\\right)$, but the dominant effect here is the much lower $a_{w}$ (and thus $p_{w}^{\\text{eq}}$) of the more concentrated drop relative to the reservoir, which sets the direction of net water transfer from reservoir to drop.\n\nHence, the correct choice is that the drop volume increases and the protein becomes more dilute.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2126767"}, {"introduction": "Successfully navigating a crystallization screen involves more than just setting up experiments; it requires skillfully interpreting the outcomes. This final practice moves from setup to analysis by presenting a common yet often misunderstood observation: Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS). By learning to identify LLPS and distinguish it from amorphous precipitation, you will discover how what might seem like a failed experiment is often a highly promising result, indicating that your conditions are very close to the ideal \"sweet spot\" for crystal nucleation [@problem_id:2126782].", "problem": "A biomedical researcher is performing a crystallization screen for a newly purified enzyme using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. In this technique, a small drop containing a mixture of the purified protein solution and a precipitant solution is sealed over a larger reservoir of the precipitant solution. Over a period of several days, water vapor diffuses from the drop to the reservoir, slowly increasing the concentration of both the protein and the precipitant within the drop, ideally driving the system towards a supersaturated state suitable for crystal formation.\n\nAfter one week of incubation, the researcher examines a specific drop under a light microscope. The drop, which was initially a single, clear, homogeneous liquid, shows no signs of crystalline solids or the cloudy, amorphous precipitate typically associated with failed conditions. Instead, the drop has separated into two distinct, optically clear liquid phases. One phase exists as a collection of small, dense, spherical droplets suspended within the bulk of the second, less dense liquid phase.\n\nBased on this observation, which of the following statements most accurately identifies the phenomenon and its significance for the crystallization trial?\n\nA. The phenomenon is denaturation, indicating that the precipitant has unfolded the protein. This condition is highly unfavorable and far from the conditions required for crystallization.\n\nB. The phenomenon is biphasic precipitation, where the protein has formed an amorphous, liquid-like precipitate. This is a terminal state that prevents any possibility of crystallization.\n\nC. The phenomenon is called salting in, where the precipitant has dramatically increased the protein's solubility, causing it to separate from the solvent. This condition is far from the supersaturation state needed for crystal growth.\n\nD. The phenomenon is Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS), where the solution has partitioned into a protein-rich dense phase and a protein-poor light phase. This is often a highly promising result, as the conditions are typically very close to those required for crystal nucleation.\n\nE. The phenomenon is osmotic shock, where the rapid diffusion of water has lysed the protein into insoluble fragments. This indicates a procedural failure and provides no useful information about crystallization propensity.", "solution": "We begin by interpreting the experimental setup and the observed outcome. In hanging-drop vapor diffusion, water evaporates from the drop into the reservoir, increasing the concentrations of both protein and precipitant in the drop over time. This process moves the system across the protein phase diagram, potentially into the supersaturated regime where crystal nucleation and growth are possible. Typical outcomes include clear drops (undersaturated), crystals (within the nucleation and growth zone), amorphous precipitate (nonspecific aggregation in the precipitation zone), or liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), where the system demixes into two liquid phases.\n\nThe observation described is: after one week, the drop shows no crystals or cloudiness, but instead two clear liquid phases are present, with small, dense, spherical droplets dispersed in a less dense continuous phase. The droplets are optically clear and spherical, consistent with a phase-separated dense liquid phase stabilized by surface tension, suspended within a protein-poor light phase. This is the characteristic signature of LLPS in protein solutions: demixing into a protein-rich dense liquid and a protein-poor dilute liquid.\n\nThe significance of LLPS in protein crystallization is grounded in the protein phase diagram. LLPS typically occurs near or overlapping the supersaturation region where crystal nucleation can occur; the binodal (liquid-liquid coexistence) region often lies adjacent to the metastable zone for nucleation. Conditions that yield LLPS are therefore frequently close to those required for crystallization, and microenvironments within or at the interface of droplets can promote nucleation. Practically, small adjustments (e.g., slight changes in precipitant concentration, pH, temperature, or additives) can shift from LLPS to productive crystal nucleation and growth.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- Option A (denaturation): Denaturation generally leads to loss of native structure and often to aggregation and turbidity or irreversible precipitation, not two clear liquid phases with spherical droplets. The observation does not match denaturation.\n- Option B (biphasic precipitation): Amorphous precipitation is typically cloudy or flocculent, not optically clear droplets. Moreover, calling it a terminal state that precludes crystallization conflicts with the well-established utility of conditions near LLPS for crystallization optimization.\n- Option C (salting in): Salting in increases solubility and would favor a single homogeneous phase with less propensity for demixing. It does not cause separation into two liquid phases.\n- Option D (LLPS): Correctly describes two clear phases with dense spherical droplets representing a protein-rich phase coexisting with a protein-poor phase, and correctly notes that such conditions are often close to crystallization conditions.\n- Option E (osmotic shock): Osmotic shock pertains to cells; purified proteins are not lysed by osmotic gradients into fragments yielding clear liquid droplets. This is inapplicable and inconsistent with the observation.\n\nTherefore, the phenomenon is LLPS, and it is often a promising indicator that conditions are near those needed for crystal nucleation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2126782"}]}
