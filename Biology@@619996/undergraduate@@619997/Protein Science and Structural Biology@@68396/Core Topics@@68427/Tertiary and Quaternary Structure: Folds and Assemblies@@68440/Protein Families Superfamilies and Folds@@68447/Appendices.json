To investigate a potential evolutionary relationship, a sequence alignment is performed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm. The search compares the amino acid sequence of Protein Alpha against the sequence of Protein Beta. The result of this alignment yields an Expect-value ($E$-value) of 15. The $E$-value in this context represents the number of alignments with the observed level of similarity that would be expected to occur by random chance. A lower $E$-value indicates a more statistically significant alignment.\n\nBased solely on this $E$-value, select the most appropriate conclusion regarding the relationship between Protein Alpha and Protein Beta.\n\nA. Protein Alpha and Protein Beta are almost certainly members of the same protein family.\n\nB.

By definition, the E-value, denoted $E$, is the expected number of alignments with a score at least as high as the observed score that would occur by random chance under a suitable null model of unrelated sequences. Under the Karlin–Altschul statistics for local alignments, the expected count of random hits with score at least $S$ scales as\n$$\nE = K m n \\exp(-\\lambda S),\n$$\nwhere $m$ and $n$ are the effective lengths of the query and database (or target) sequences, $\\lambda$ and $K$ are positive parameters determined by the scoring system and background frequencies, and $S$ is the raw alignment score. Equivalently, the number of such random hits can be modeled as a Poisson random variable with mean $E$, so the probability of observing at least one random hit at that score or higher is\n$$\nP(\\text{at least one random hit}) = 1 - \\exp(-E).\n$$\nSignificance for homology inference typically requires $E \\le \\alpha$ for a small threshold $\\alpha$ with $\\alpha \\ll 1$, so that $1 - \\exp(-E) \\approx E$ is also $\\ll 1$ and the null hypothesis of random similarity is unlikely.\n\nIn the present case, the reported E-value is $E=15$. Since $E \\gg 1$, the Poisson model implies\n$$\nP(\\text{at least one random hit}) = 1 - \\exp(-E) \\approx 1,\n$$\nwhich indicates that alignments of the observed similarity level are expected to occur frequently by chance alone. Therefore, the alignment is not statistically significant, and one cannot infer homology or membership in the same family or superfamily based on this sequence similarity.\n\nEvaluating the options under this interpretation:\n- Option A claims strong homology at the family level, which is not supported because $E \\gg 1$.\n- Option B suggests superfamily-level relatedness, which also requires statistical support not present at $E \\gg 1$.\n- Option C states that it is highly improbable that they are members of the same family based on sequence similarity alone, which correctly reflects the lack of statistical significance when $E$ is large.\n- Option D asserts the absence of any evolutionary relationship, which is too strong; lack of sequence-level significance does not rule out remote homology undetectable by BLAST or detectable via structure.\n- Option E asserts structural fold identity, which cannot be concluded from a non-significant alignment.\n\nThus, based solely on the given E-value, the most appropriate conclusion is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2127737"}, {"introduction": "Since protein structure is more conserved throughout evolution than sequence, structural comparison is a powerful tool for identifying distant evolutionary relationships. When we superimpose two protein structures, we need a quantitative measure of how well they match. This practice introduces the Root Mean Square Deviation ($RMSD$), the standard metric for this purpose, and challenges you to interpret its value in the context of the fold classification hierarchy. [@problem_id:2127718]", "problem": "A structural biologist is investigating the relationship between two single-domain proteins, Protein A and Protein B. After obtaining their three-dimensional atomic coordinates, the biologist performs a structural alignment by superimposing the backbone C-alpha atoms of the two proteins. The Root Mean Square Deviation ($RMSD$) between the corresponding C-alpha atoms is calculated to be 6.5 Å. In structural biology, protein structures are often classified into a hierarchy: proteins with significant sequence and structural similarity are grouped into 'families'; families with a probable common evolutionary origin but low sequence similarity are grouped into 'superfamilies'; and superfamilies with the same major secondary structure elements in the same spatial arrangement are grouped into the same 'fold' class.\n\nBased on the conventional interpretation of $RMSD$ values in structural comparison, what is the most likely conclusion about the relationship between Protein A and Protein B?\n\nA. Protein A and Protein B belong to the same protein family.\n\nB. Protein A and Protein B belong to the same protein superfamily.\n\nC. Protein A and Protein B most likely have different folds.\n\nD. Protein A and Protein B have a high degree of sequence identity, but their folds have diverged.\n\nE. The $RMSD$ value alone is insufficient to conclude anything about their fold; their sequence identity must also be known.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the definition of the backbone C-alpha RMSD used after optimal rigid-body superposition. For $N$ aligned C-alpha positions $\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i}^{A}\\}$ and $\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i}^{B}\\}$, the RMSD is\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSD}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left\\|\\mathbf{r}_{i}^{A}-\\mathbf{r}_{i}^{B}\\right\\|^{2}}.\n$$\nBy construction, a lower RMSD indicates a closer three-dimensional match between corresponding atoms after optimal superposition. In conventional structural biology practice for single-domain proteins, typical interpretive ranges are as follows: RMSD values on the order of $1$–$2$ (in angstroms) are characteristic of very similar structures often within the same family; RMSD values in the range of approximately $2$–$4$ are consistent with structural similarity that could extend across low sequence identity, often seen within the same superfamily; RMSD values above approximately $4$–$5$ generally indicate substantial structural divergence, often associated with different folds, especially when the comparison is over a comparable domain-sized alignment of C-alpha atoms.\n\nGiven the reported RMSD of $6.5$, which is substantially larger than the typical thresholds associated with family- or even superfamily-level similarity for single-domain comparisons, the most likely interpretation is that the two proteins do not share the same overall fold. While RMSD alone does not prove evolutionary relationships and can be influenced by alignment length and flexible regions, the question asks for the most likely conclusion based on conventional interpretation, and an RMSD of $6.5$ strongly argues against the proteins belonging to the same fold.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A (same family) is unlikely because family-level similarity generally yields much lower RMSD.\n- B (same superfamily) is also unlikely; superfamily-level similarities typically yield lower RMSD than $6.5$ for single domains.\n- C (different folds) is the most consistent with an RMSD of $6.5$ for single-domain proteins.\n- D (high sequence identity but divergent folds) is generally implausible; high sequence identity rarely corresponds to different folds.\n- E (RMSD alone is insufficient to conclude anything about fold) is too strong a statement; while RMSD is not definitive alone, a value as high as $6.5$ for single-domain C-alpha alignment conventionally suggests different folds as the most likely scenario.\n\nTherefore, the most likely conclusion is that the proteins have different folds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2127718"}, {"introduction": "Theory becomes practice when faced with a true unknown.

PSI-BLAST builds a position-specific scoring matrix iteratively, increasing sensitivity to remote homologs compared to standard BLAST. This is a logical next step after no hits with standard BLAST.\n- B: Submitting the 3D coordinates to structural alignment servers such as DALI or Foldseek is directly aligned with structure-based classification, identifying structural neighbors in the PDB that are often already mapped to CATH/SCOP.\n- C: Concluding a new fold purely because BLAST failed is inappropriate and illogical; many remote homologs evade standard BLAST yet share established folds detectable by profile or structure-based methods.\n- D: Discarding a high-confidence AI model is not justified. While threading can be used as complementary evidence, the option explicitly instructs to discard the existing model, which is not a sound step in a standard workflow given a high-confidence structure.\n- E: Calculating isoelectric point and molecular weight and searching by these properties does not aid fold/superfamily classification; these features are not fold-specific and are not used by CATH/SCOP.\n- F: Visual inspection of secondary structure arrangement and topology using molecular graphics is a standard and valuable step to verify and interpret automated structural matches and to map to CATH/SCOP architectural and topological terms.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate and logical actions are A, B, and F.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABF}$$", "id": "2127725"}]}
