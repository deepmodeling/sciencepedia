This packing is often mediated by a \"knobs-into-holes\" arrangement, where a residue from one helix (the knob) fits into a depression on the surface of an adjacent helix (the hole). At certain critical intersections, a very small residue is required to allow the helices to approach each other closely.\n\nConsider a hypothetical globin-like protein where a highly conserved glycine (Gly) residue is located at such a tight helix-helix interface. We wish to estimate the energetic consequence of mutating this glycine to a tryptophan (Trp), the bulkiest natural amino acid.\n\nAssume that the primary energetic penalty for this mutation arises from the steric cost of creating space within the protein's hydrophobic core to accommodate the much larger tryptophan sidechain. This cost can be modeled as a destabilization free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{destab}$, which is proportional to the additional volume the protein must create.\n\nUsing the simplified model and parameters below, calculate the destabilization free energy for this Gly-to-Trp mutation.\n\n**Given Parameters:**\n- The van der Waals volume of a glycine sidechain: $V_{Gly} = 4.0$ Å³\n- The van der Waals volume of a tryptophan sidechain: $V_{Trp} = 162.9$ Å³\n- The effective free energy penalty for creating a cavity in the protein's hydrophobic core, per unit volume: $\\gamma = 0.18$ kJ/mol per Å³\n\nExpress your final answer for the destabilization free energy in kJ/mol, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the destabilization free energy ($\\Delta\\Delta G_{destab}$) resulting from a Glycine to Tryptophan mutation in a tightly packed protein core.
