Residues 13-15 (F-V-I)", "solution": "First, apply the stated principle that amino acid side-chain propensities strongly bias secondary structure formation: alanine, leucine, glutamate, and lysine favor an α-helix; valine, isoleucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and threonine favor β-strands; glycine and proline tend to break helices or form turns. For a central helix in a β-α-β motif, we expect a contiguous run enriched in helix formers and free of glycine and proline, ideally flanked by beta-prone residues that can serve as strands and by turn-favoring residues at the helix boundaries.\n\nExamine each candidate segment using these rules:\n- Option A (residues 1–5: V-I-T-Y-G) contains several β-strand formers (V, I, T, Y) and ends with glycine, which disfavors helix formation; this is unlikely to be a stable α-helix segment.\n- Option B (residues 3–8: T-Y-G-P-A-L) contains both glycine and proline in the middle; either can disrupt helices, and together they strongly disfavor a continuous α-helix through this span.\n- Option C (residues 7–11: A-L-E-K-A) comprises only strong helix-promoting residues (A, L, E, K, A) with no glycine or proline; this is an ideal helical core, and five residues provide a sufficient minimal length for an α-helix segment.\n- Option D (residues 11–15: A-G-F-V-I) includes glycine immediately after position 11 and then β-strand-prone residues (F, V, I), which disfavors α-helix formation.\n- Option E (residues 13–15: F-V-I) is only three residues long and composed of β-prone residues; it is too short and compositionally unfavorable for a stable α-helix.\n\nAdditionally, for a β-α-β motif, the α-helix is central and typically flanked by β-prone regions and turn-forming residues. The sequence positions 1–4 (V, I, T, Y) and 13–15 (F, V, I) are enriched in β-prone residues, while positions 5–6 (G, P) can form a turn leading into an α-helix that begins at residue 7. This pattern further supports residues 7–11 as the most likely central α-helix segment.\n\nTherefore, the most likely contiguous helical segment is residues 7–11 (A-L-E-K-A).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2148006"}, {"introduction": "The stability of a $\\beta$-$\\alpha$-$\\beta$ motif relies not only on the correct sequence of secondary structures but also on the precise geometry of the loops connecting them. This practice problem [@problem_id:2148012] uses a thought experiment to explore the critical role that specific residues play in maintaining this architecture, focusing on the unique properties of glycine in forming tight turns. You will analyze how steric constraints dictate protein foldability and discover why even a single amino acid change in a critical position can have drastic consequences for the entire structure.", "problem": "In many globular proteins, a common supersecondary structure known as the β-α-β motif is observed. This motif consists of two parallel β-strands connected by an intervening α-helix. The polypeptide chain must form tight turns in the loop regions that connect the end of the first β-strand to the start of the α-helix, and the end of the α-helix to the start of the second β-strand.\n\nConsider a specific β-α-β motif where a particular glycine residue in the first loop (connecting the first β-strand to the α-helix) is conserved across a wide range of species. Structural analysis reveals this glycine adopts a main-chain conformation with dihedral angles (φ, ψ) that fall into a region of the Ramachandran plot that is generally disallowed for all amino acids except glycine. A site-directed mutagenesis experiment is performed, replacing this critical glycine with a tryptophan residue.\n\nBased on the principles of protein structure, which of the following statements describes the most likely consequence of this Gly-to-Trp mutation on the structure of the β-α-β motif?\n\nA. The bulky tryptophan side chain will not fit in the tight turn, leading to severe steric clashes that disrupt the proper folding and packing of the entire motif.\n\nB. The mutation will have no significant effect on the overall structure, as it occurs in a flexible loop region that can easily accommodate the larger side chain.\n\nC. The tryptophan side chain will form new, stabilizing hydrophobic interactions with the core of the protein, making the motif more stable than the original.\n\nD. The polypeptide chain will compensate by elongating the α-helix by two turns, creating more space for the tryptophan side chain.\n\nE. The tryptophan will induce the loop to adopt a β-sheet conformation, resulting in a three-stranded parallel β-sheet instead of a β-α-β motif.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most likely structural consequence of replacing a conserved glycine with a tryptophan in a tight turn of a β-α-β motif. To determine this, we must analyze the properties of glycine and tryptophan and their roles in protein structure.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the role of the conserved glycine.\nThe problem states that the glycine residue is located in a tight turn and adopts dihedral angles (φ, ψ) in a region of the Ramachandran plot that is \"disallowed for all amino acids except glycine.\" The Ramachandran plot illustrates the sterically allowed combinations of φ and ψ backbone dihedral angles for a polypeptide chain. Most amino acids are restricted to specific regions due to steric clashes between their side chain ($C_{\\beta}$ atom and beyond) and the backbone atoms. Glycine is unique because its side chain is a single hydrogen atom. This lack of a bulky side chain means it experiences far fewer steric constraints and can adopt a much wider range of φ and ψ angles, including those in the \"disallowed\" regions for other amino acids. The fact that this specific glycine is conserved and occupies such a conformation strongly implies that this unusual backbone geometry is essential for creating the sharp turn needed to connect the β-strand to the α-helix.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the properties of the substituting amino acid, tryptophan.\nTryptophan has the largest and bulkiest side chain of the 20 common amino acids, consisting of a large, aromatic indole ring. Due to its size, tryptophan is highly sterically hindered and is restricted to a much smaller set of allowed φ and ψ angles compared to glycine.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the consequence of the mutation.\nThe mutation replaces the small, flexible glycine with the extremely bulky tryptophan at a position that requires a conformation only glycine can adopt. When tryptophan is placed at this position, its large side chain will inevitably clash with the local backbone atoms of the polypeptide chain. The chain simply cannot bend into the required sharp turn because the tryptophan side chain physically gets in the way. This is a severe steric hindrance.\n\nStep 4: Predict the impact on the overall motif structure.\nThe inability to form this critical turn has cascading effects. If the first loop cannot connect the first β-strand and the α-helix correctly, the α-helix cannot be positioned properly relative to the β-sheet. The correct packing of the secondary structure elements, which is essential for the stability and function of the motif, will be prevented. Therefore, the entire three-dimensional structure of the β-α-β motif is likely to be destabilized, disrupted, or completely unable to form. This leads directly to the conclusion in option A.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the other options.\n- Option B is incorrect. While loops are generally more flexible than secondary structure elements, positions with conserved residues are often structurally critical. A position requiring glycine-specific angles is a prime example of such a critical site, and a mutation there is expected to have a significant effect.\n- Option C is incorrect. While tryptophan can participate in favorable hydrophobic interactions, this is irrelevant if the fundamental backbone conformation is sterically forbidden. The severe energetic penalty from the steric clash will far outweigh any potential stabilizing energy from new interactions. The structure must be able to form in the first place for those interactions to occur.\n- Option D is incorrect. Local mutations do not typically cause large-scale, coordinated changes like the uniform elongation of an entire secondary structure element. This would require a concerted change in the hydrogen bonding pattern of the helix and is not a direct or likely consequence of a single point mutation.\n- Option E is incorrect. A change in secondary structure from a loop to a β-strand is a drastic rearrangement and is not the expected outcome of a simple steric clash. The most direct result of the clash is the failure to adopt the native fold, not the formation of an entirely different one.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and certain consequence is the structural disruption caused by the steric clash.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2148012"}]}
