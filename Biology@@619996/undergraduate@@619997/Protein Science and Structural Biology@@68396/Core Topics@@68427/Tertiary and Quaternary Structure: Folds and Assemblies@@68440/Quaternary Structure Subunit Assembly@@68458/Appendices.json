Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) analysis of the purified complex indicates a total molecular weight of approximately 330 kDa for the native, fully assembled state. To determine its subunit composition, the complex was subjected to Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under denaturing conditions. This experiment revealed the presence of two distinct polypeptide chains: subunit alpha (CatA) and subunit beta (CatB).\n\nMass spectrometry confirmed the molecular weights of the individual subunits to be 60 kDa for CatA and 45 kDa for CatB. Further biochemical assays suggest that the molar ratio of CatA to CatB subunits in the functional complex is greater than 1. Assuming the complex consists only of CatA and CatB subunits and the given masses are precise, which of the following represents the correct stoichiometry ($(\\text{CatA})_x(\\text{CatB})_y$) of the Catalysozyme complex?\n\nA. $(\\text{CatA})_1(\\text{CatB})_6$\n\nB. $(\\text{CatA})_2(\\text{CatB})_5$\n\nC. $(\\text{CatA})_3(\\text{CatB})_4$\n\nD. $(\\text{CatA})_4(\\text{CatB})_2$\n\nE. $(\\text{CatA})_5(\\text{CatB})_1$", "solution": "Let $m_{\\text{A}}$ and $m_{\\text{B}}$ denote the molecular masses of CatA and CatB, respectively, and let $x$ and $y$ be their stoichiometric counts in the complex.

Structural analysis reveals that rotamerin is a homotetramer, meaning it is composed of four identical polypeptide subunits. These subunits are arranged in a highly symmetric fashion. The molecule possesses a single, principal axis of 4-fold rotational symmetry. A rotation of 90 degrees around this axis leaves the molecule's appearance unchanged. Additionally, the molecule has four distinct 2-fold rotational symmetry axes, each of which is perpendicular to the principal 4-fold axis.

We will use the Schoenflies notation for point groups.\n\nStep 1: Identify the principal axis of rotation.\nThe problem states that the protein has a single, principal axis of 4-fold rotational symmetry. This is denoted as a $C_4$ axis. The presence of a $C_n$ axis is a fundamental feature of many point groups.\n\nStep 2: Identify any other symmetry elements, particularly perpendicular rotational axes.\nThe problem specifies that there are four 2-fold rotational symmetry axes ($C_2$) and that each of these axes is perpendicular to the principal $C_4$ axis.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of point group classification.\nPoint groups are categorized based on their collection of symmetry elements.\n- **Cyclic groups ($C_n$)**: These groups possess only one $n$-fold rotational axis. Option A, $C_4$, represents a group with only a single $C_4$ axis. Since our protein has additional $C_2$ axes, it cannot belong to the $C_4$ group.\n- **Dihedral groups ($D_n$)**: These groups are defined by the presence of a principal $n$-fold axis ($C_n$) and exactly $n$ 2-fold axes ($C_2$) that are perpendicular to the principal axis. In our case, $n=4$. The protein has a principal $C_4$ axis and four perpendicular $C_2$ axes. This perfectly matches the definition of the $D_4$ point group.\n- **Other groups**: Let's examine the other options to confirm our choice.\n    - Option B, $D_2$: This group has a principal $C_2$ axis and two perpendicular $C_2$ axes. Our protein has a $C_4$ principal axis, so this is incorrect.\n    - Option D, $T$ (Tetrahedral group): This is a high-symmetry cubic group. Its characteristic symmetry elements include four $C_3$ axes and three $C_2$ axes. The protein described has a $C_4$ axis, not $C_3$ axes, so this is incorrect.\n    - Option E, $C_{4v}$: This group contains a principal $C_4$ axis, but its secondary symmetry elements are four vertical mirror planes ($\\sigma_v$) that contain the $C_4$ axis, not perpendicular $C_2$ axes. The problem explicitly states that mirror planes are absent. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the point group assignment.\nThe combination of one principal $C_4$ axis and four perpendicular $C_2$ axes uniquely defines the $D_4$ point group.\n\nTherefore, the correct point group for the rotamerin protein is $D_4$.
