Consider a $\\beta$-sheet composed of four antiparallel $\\beta$-strands. The strands are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 according to their sequence along the polypeptide chain.

To do this, we must compare the given descriptions with the standard definitions of the $\\beta$-meander and Greek key motifs.\n\nFirst, let's define the key motifs.\nA **$\\beta$-meander** motif consists of two or more consecutive antiparallel $\\beta$-strands linked together by short turns or loops. If we number the strands sequentially along the polypeptide chain (1, 2, 3, 4, ...), the strands in a $\\beta$-meander are arranged sequentially in space as well. For a four-stranded meander, strands 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all adjacent to one another in a simple back-and-forth, or \"meandering,\" pattern.\n\nA **Greek key** motif is a more complex arrangement of four or more antiparallel $\\beta$-strands. The defining characteristic is that the polypeptide chain \"folds over\" on itself. For a classic four-stranded Greek key, strands 1 and 2 are adjacent, and strands 3 and 4 are adjacent. However, the loop connecting strand 2 to strand 3 is long, crossing over the top of the sheet to bring strand 3 adjacent to strand 4. This results in a non-sequential arrangement of the strands in the final sheet. A common arrangement for a Greek key is 4-1-2-3 (or its mirror image 2-3-4-1, etc.), where the outer strands (1 and 4) are hydrogen-bonded to each other.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given topologies.\n\n**Analysis of Topology I:**\nThe description states: \"The polypeptide chain forms strand 1, followed by a short turn to form the adjacent strand 2. Another short turn connects strand 2 to the adjacent strand 3. A final short turn connects strand 3 to the adjacent strand 4.\" This describes a simple, consecutive connection pattern: 1 is connected to 2, 2 is connected to 3, and 3 is connected to 4. The resulting spatial arrangement is 1-2-3-4. This perfectly matches the definition of a **$\\beta$-meander** motif.\n\n**Analysis of Topology II:**\nThe description states: \"The polypeptide chain forms strand 1, followed by a short turn to form the adjacent strand 2. The chain then forms a long loop or crossover connection... where it forms strand 3. Strand 3 is then connected by a short turn to the adjacent strand 4.\" The crucial information is the final strand order: \"the final strand order in the sheet of 4-1-2-3.\" This non-sequential arrangement, where the first and last strands in the sequence (1 and 4) end up adjacent in the middle of the sheet due to a long crossover connection, is the hallmark of the **Greek key** motif.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Topology I is a $\\beta$-meander motif.\n- Topology II is a Greek key motif.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA. Topology I is a Greek key motif; Topology II is a $\\beta$-meander motif. (Incorrect)\nB. Topology I is a Jelly roll motif; Topology II is a Greek key motif. (Incorrect, Topology I is a meander)\nC.

In an antiparallel hairpin, the hydrogen-bonded registry places residue 1 opposite 10, 2 opposite 9, 3 opposite 8, and 4 opposite 7.\n\nPrinciples for stability:\n1) Turn propensity: Two-residue turns in $\\beta$-hairpins are strongly favored by a Pro-Gly motif at positions 5 and 6. Proline at position i restricts the backbone dihedral angle, and glycine at position i plus 1 accommodates the required positive phi angle in type II or II-prime turns. Alternatives such as Asn-Gly or Asp-Gly can also nucleate turns, but Pro-Gly is a classic strong nucleator; Gly-Asn is less favorable than Asn-Gly.\n2) Strand patterning: Alternating polar and nonpolar side chains along each strand promotes amphipathic $\\beta$-strands with good solubility and packing. Hydrophobic-hydrophobic cross-strand contacts (e.g., 4 with 7, 3 with 8, 2 with 9, 1 with 10) stabilize the hairpin interior. Favorable polar or salt-bridge interactions across strands can also stabilize; like-charge across from each other can destabilize.\n3) Aqueous solubility: Excessive hydrophobicity (e.g., fully hydrophobic sequences) risks aggregation in water rather than forming a defined monomeric hairpin.\n\nEvaluate each option, setting the putative turn at positions 5 and 6 and assessing turn propensity, strand patterning, and cross-strand complementarity.\n\nA.

Consider two common supersecondary structures, or motifs, each composed of four identical, antiparallel $\\beta$-strands of equal length.\n\nThe first motif is a **$\\beta$-meander**. In this topology, the strands are arranged sequentially within the sheet, such that strand 1 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 2, strand 2 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 3, and strand 3 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 4. The polypeptide chain connects the strands in numerical order, with the N-terminus at the beginning of strand 1 and the C-terminus at the end of strand 4.\n\nThe second motif is a **Greek key**. In this topology, the polypeptide chain also connects strands in the order 1-2-3-4. However, the spatial arrangement of the strands within the final hydrogen-bonded sheet is 4-1-2-3. Consequently, strand 4 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 1, strand 1 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 2, and strand 2 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 3. The N-terminus is at the beginning of strand 1, and the C-terminus is at the end of strand 4.\n\nA theoretical experiment is conducted where a tensile force is applied to the termini of each motif, pulling on the N-terminus of strand 1 and the C-terminus of strand 4. The mechanical resistance to unfolding is defined by the motif's ability to resist separation. This resistance is primarily determined by the number of backbone hydrogen bonds that are loaded in parallel by the pulling force and must be broken simultaneously to initiate unfolding.\n\nBased on this principle, which motif would exhibit greater mechanical resistance to the pulling force, and what is the underlying topological reason?\n\nA. The $\\beta$-meander, because the pulling force is distributed more evenly across the three separate hydrogen-bonded interfaces.\n\nB. The Greek key, because the polypeptide termini are located on strands that are spatially adjacent and hydrogen-bonded, placing these bonds directly in the line of force.\n\nC. The $\\beta$-meander, because the longer polypeptide loops connecting the non-adjacent strands absorb more strain, protecting the hydrogen-bond network.\n\nD. The Greek key, because its topology necessitates breaking hydrogen bonds at two separate interfaces (between strands 4-1 and 2-3) simultaneously to cause separation.\n\nE. Both motifs have equal mechanical resistance because they are composed of the same number of strands and have approximately the same total number of hydrogen bonds.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which of two four-stranded antiparallel $\\beta$-sheet motifs, a $\\beta$-meander or a Greek key, has greater mechanical resistance when pulled by its termini. The resistance is related to the number of hydrogen bonds that must be broken simultaneously.\n\nLet's analyze the topology and the effect of the applied force for each motif. The force is applied to the N-terminus of strand 1 and the C-terminus of strand 4 in both cases.\n\n**1. Analysis of the $\\beta$-Meander Motif:**\n- **Topology:** The strands are arranged sequentially in space: 1-2-3-4.\n- **Connectivity:** The polypeptide chain runs from strand 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4.\n- **Hydrogen Bonding:** Strands 1 and 2 are H-bonded. Strands 2 and 3 are H-bonded. Strands 3 and 4 are H-bonded.\n- **Force Application:** The pulling force is applied at the beginning of strand 1 and the end of strand 4. These two strands are at opposite ends of the sheet and are not hydrogen-bonded to each other.\n- **Force Propagation and Unfolding:** The tensile force is transmitted through the covalent backbone of the polypeptide chain: through strand 1, the turn to strand 2, strand 2, the turn to strand 3, strand 3, the turn to strand 4, and finally strand 4. The force acts to pull the entire chain straight. This puts stress on the turns and can lead to an \"unzipping\" or \"shear\" mechanism. For instance, the hydrogen bonds holding the sheet together (e.g., between strands 2 and 3) are not directly in the primary line of force between the two termini. The structure can be peeled apart more easily because the force is not directly opposing a large bank of hydrogen bonds in parallel. The unfolding pathway involves breaking a few hydrogen bonds at a time, or shearing one interface. This is a \"series\" loading configuration for the H-bond interfaces.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Greek Key Motif:**\n- **Topology:** The strands are arranged in space as 4-1-2-3.\n- **Connectivity:** The polypeptide chain connects the strands in the order 1-2-3-4.\n- **Hydrogen Bonding:** Strand 4 is H-bonded to strand 1. Strand 1 is H-bonded to strand 2. Strand 2 is H-bonded to strand 3.\n- **Force Application:** The pulling force is applied at the N-terminus of strand 1 and the C-terminus of strand 4.\n- **Force Propagation and Unfolding:** Critically, in the Greek key's spatial arrangement (4-1-2-3), the strands being pulled (1 and 4) are physically adjacent and directly hydrogen-bonded to each other. The applied tensile force therefore acts directly across the interface between strand 1 and strand 4. To pull the N-terminus of strand 1 away from the C-terminus of strand 4, all the hydrogen bonds connecting these two strands must be broken simultaneously. This constitutes a \"parallel\" loading of these specific hydrogen bonds. Breaking many bonds at once requires a significantly higher peak force than breaking them one by one (unzipping) or shearing an interface not directly held by the termini.\n\n**3. Comparison and Conclusion:**\n- In the $\\beta$-meander, the force is transmitted along the backbone, and the hydrogen bonds are loaded in a way that allows for sequential failure (unzipping or shear). The pulling points are far apart in the hydrogen-bonding network.\n- In the Greek key, the pulling points (on strands 1 and 4) are on spatially adjacent strands, placing the hydrogen bonds between them directly in the line of force. These bonds are loaded in parallel and must fail simultaneously, leading to high mechanical resistance.\n- Therefore, the Greek key motif is mechanically more resistant to this specific mode of pulling.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n- A. Incorrect. The force is not distributed evenly; the meander topology is weaker against this type of force.\n- B. Correct. This accurately describes the situation in the Greek key. The termini are on adjacent strands (1 and 4), placing the H-bonds between them directly in the line of force, acting as a parallel set of interactions that must be broken at once.\n- C. Incorrect. While loops can have complex mechanical properties, the primary reason for the meander's lower resistance is the force pathway, not strain absorption in the loops.\n- D. Incorrect. This MISINTERPRETS the failure mechanism. The primary resistance in the Greek key comes from the interface that is directly stressed by the pulling force (the 4-1 interface), not from the need to break multiple interfaces simultaneously. The force is concentrated on one key interface.\n- E. Incorrect. This ignores the crucial role of topology in determining how forces are distributed across the non-covalent interactions. The total number of bonds is not the sole determinant of mechanical strength; their arrangement is key.\n\nThe correct choice is B, as it correctly identifies the stronger motif and the correct topological reason for its enhanced stability under tensile load.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2140395"}]}
