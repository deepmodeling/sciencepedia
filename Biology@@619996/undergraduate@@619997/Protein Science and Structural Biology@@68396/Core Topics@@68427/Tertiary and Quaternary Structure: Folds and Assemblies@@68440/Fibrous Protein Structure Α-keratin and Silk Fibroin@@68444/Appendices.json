This strength arises from its hierarchical structure, beginning with two α-helices wrapping around each other to form a left-handed coiled-coil. This association is stabilized by a hydrophobic interface between the two helices. The primary sequence of α-keratin exhibits a characteristic seven-residue repeat, known as a heptad repeat, which can be denoted as $(a-b-c-d-e-f-g)_n$. In this pattern, the residues at positions 'a' and 'd' are predominantly non-polar and are oriented to form the buried, hydrophobic seam that holds the two helices together. The residues at other positions are typically more polar and face the aqueous solvent.\n\nConsider the following 14-residue peptide sequence, which is a hypothetical segment from an α-keratin chain:\n\nSequence: Leu-Gln-Ser-Ile-Glu-Ala-Lys-Val-Asn-Thr-Leu-Asp-Gly-Arg\n\nAssuming this peptide adopts an α-helical conformation and forms a coiled-coil with an identical peptide, identify the set of amino acid residues that would most likely form the core hydrophobic interface.

Its structure is primarily composed of long polypeptide chains that adopt a right-handed α-helical conformation. Two of these α-helices then intertwine to form a left-handed supercoiled structure known as a coiled-coil, which serves as the basic building block for larger filaments. This coiled-coil structure is stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding within each α-helix and hydrophobic interactions between the two helices.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic mutation that results in the insertion of a single proline residue into the central region of an otherwise normal α-keratin polypeptide chain.

The insertion will enhance the hydrogen bonding network of the α-helix, making it more rigid and thermally stable.", "solution": "An $\\alpha$-helix is stabilized by a regular pattern of backbone hydrogen bonds in which the carbonyl oxygen of residue $i$ accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide hydrogen of residue $i+4$. This continuous intrahelical hydrogen-bond network requires each residue (except at the termini) to contribute a backbone amide hydrogen donor and to adopt backbone dihedral angles compatible with the helical geometry.\n\nProline is unique because its side chain covalently bonds to its backbone nitrogen, forming an imino acid. As a result:\n- The backbone amide nitrogen of proline lacks a hydrogen and therefore cannot donate the required intrahelical hydrogen bond.\n- The cyclic structure imposes a rigid constraint on the backbone $\\phi$ dihedral angle, which is generally incompatible with the regular $\\alpha$-helical geometry in the middle of a helix.\n\nTherefore, insertion of a single proline into the central region of an $\\alpha$-helical segment of $\\alpha$-keratin will disrupt the local hydrogen-bonding pattern and the helical backbone dihedral angles, producing a localized distortion.

This exceptional packing is only possible due to a primary sequence rich in amino acids with very small side chains. This hypothetical exercise [@problem_id:2111342] explores the principle of steric hindrance by asking you to consider the consequence of replacing small glycine residues with bulky ones, reinforcing the critical link between amino acid size and the formation of crystalline-like protein assemblies.", "problem": "The primary protein component of silk produced by the *Bombyx mori* silkworm is fibroin. Its remarkable strength and flexibility are derived from its higher-order structure, which consists of extended polypeptide chains in an antiparallel β-sheet conformation. These sheets are stacked in layers. The primary sequence of silk fibroin is characterized by a highly repetitive pattern, predominantly composed of the amino acid sequence (Gly-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala)$_n$. The small side chains of glycine (a hydrogen atom) and alanine (a methyl group) are crucial for allowing the β-sheets to pack together in a very dense, crystalline-like arrangement.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a genetic engineering experiment results in a modified silkworm that produces fibroin in which 50% of the glycine residues in the repetitive regions are systematically replaced with valine residues. Valine is an amino acid with a bulky, nonpolar side chain.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary structural consequence of this substitution on the higher-order arrangement of the fibroin protein?\n\nA. The bulky side chains of valine will cause significant steric hindrance, preventing the close packing of β-sheets and leading to a more disordered, amorphous structure.\n\nB. The hydrophobic nature of the valine side chains will enhance the hydrophobic interactions between the β-sheets, leading to a more stable and tightly packed structure.\n\nC. The presence of valine will disrupt the β-sheet tendency of the polypeptide chain, causing the modified segments to refold into α-helices.\n\nD. The substitution will have no significant effect on the overall structure because both glycine and valine are amino acids with nonpolar side chains.\n\nE. The valine residues will facilitate the formation of new covalent cross-links between the β-sheets, resulting in a much more rigid and brittle fiber.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the structural impact of replacing a significant number of glycine residues with valine residues in silk fibroin. To do this, we must compare the properties of glycine and valine and understand their roles in the native fibroin structure.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the native structure of silk fibroin.\nThe key structural feature of silk fibroin is the stacking of antiparallel β-sheets. The mechanical properties of silk depend on this highly ordered, quasi-crystalline arrangement. This arrangement is possible because of the specific amino acid composition. The primary sequence is rich in glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), and serine (Ser), which have the three smallest side chains among the common amino acids.\n\nStep 2: Understand the specific role of glycine.\nGlycine is unique among the 20 common amino acids because its side chain is just a single hydrogen atom. This minimal size is the critical factor that allows the β-sheets in fibroin to pack together with extraordinary tightness. The side chains from one sheet fit neatly into the spaces between the side chains of the adjacent sheet, a concept often described as \"knobs-into-holes\" packing. Glycine's small size minimizes steric repulsion between the stacked sheets, permitting a very small inter-sheet distance and maximizing stabilizing van der Waals interactions.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the properties of the substituting amino acid, valine.\nValine has a side chain group of $-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$. This isopropyl group is nonpolar, but more importantly, it is much larger and bulkier than glycine's hydrogen atom.\n\nStep 4: Predict the effect of the Glycine to Valine substitution.\nWhen a glycine residue is replaced by a valine residue, the small hydrogen atom side chain is swapped for the large, branched isopropyl group. This bulky group will protrude from the β-sheet. When two such modified sheets attempt to stack, the valine side chains from one sheet will physically clash with the side chains of the opposing sheet. This is known as steric hindrance or steric repulsion. This clash will prevent the sheets from achieving the close, tight packing characteristic of native fibroin. The well-ordered, crystalline lattice will be disrupted.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n\nOption A: \"The bulky side chains of valine will cause significant steric hindrance, preventing the close packing of β-sheets and leading to a more disordered, amorphous structure.\" This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The steric clash from the bulky valine side chains is the dominant effect, which would disrupt the ordered packing and lead to a less structured, or amorphous, protein arrangement. This is the most likely outcome.\n\nOption B: \"The hydrophobic nature of the valine side chains will enhance the hydrophobic interactions between the β-sheets, leading to a more stable and tightly packed structure.\" This is incorrect. While valine is indeed hydrophobic, the stabilization from hydrophobic interactions requires the nonpolar groups to be in close proximity. The steric repulsion caused by the sheer size of the valine side chain would prevent the sheets from getting close enough for these interactions to be effective or to overcome the repulsive forces. Steric clash is the overriding factor here.\n\nOption C: \"The presence of valine will disrupt the β-sheet tendency of the polypeptide chain, causing the modified segments to refold into α-helices.\" While different amino acids have different propensities for forming α-helices or β-sheets, valine, being a β-branched amino acid, actually has a relatively high propensity to be in β-sheets. More importantly, the overall (Gly-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala)$_n$ pattern strongly favors a β-sheet conformation. A few substitutions are highly unlikely to cause a complete secondary structure transition from a β-sheet to an α-helix. The primary effect will be on the *packing* of the sheets (tertiary/quaternary structure), not the secondary structure of the chain itself.\n\nOption D: \"The substitution will have no significant effect on the overall structure because both glycine and valine are amino acids with nonpolar side chains.\" This is incorrect because it ignores the critical role of side chain size and shape (sterics) in protein packing. While polarity is an important property, in the context of the densely packed fibroin structure, the physical volume occupied by the side chain is paramount.\n\nOption E: \"The valine residues will facilitate the formation of new covalent cross-links between the β-sheets, resulting in a much more rigid and brittle fiber.\" This is fundamentally incorrect. Covalent disulfide cross-links are formed by the amino acid cysteine, which contains a sulfhydryl (-SH) group. Valine does not have a side chain capable of forming covalent cross-links.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate prediction is that the steric hindrance from the bulky valine side chains will disrupt the tight packing of the β-sheets, leading to a disordered structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2111342"}]}
