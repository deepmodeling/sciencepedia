A canonical Rossmann fold domain is constructed from a polypeptide chain that forms a six-stranded parallel $\\beta$-sheet, with the strands connected by $\\alpha$-helices that pack on both sides of the sheet.\n\nImagine you are analyzing a protein containing a single, canonical Rossmann fold. The six $\\beta$-strands are numbered sequentially along the polypeptide chain from the N-terminus to the C-terminus as $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_4, \\beta_5,$ and $\\beta_6$.

The strands are numbered $\\beta_1$ to $\\beta_6$ based on their order of appearance in the primary amino acid sequence. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the connectivity and the principle of right-handed crossover connections in parallel $\\beta$-sheets.\n\nThe Rossmann fold is composed of two repeating structural units, each being a $\\beta-\\alpha-\\beta$ motif. The overall connectivity along the chain is $\\beta_1 - \\alpha_A - \\beta_2 - \\alpha_B - \\beta_3$, which forms the first half of the domain, followed by a connecting linker (often another helix) to the second half, $\\beta_4 - \\alpha_D - \\beta_5 - \\alpha_E - \\beta_6$.\n\nLet's trace the formation of the sheet based on the principle of right-handed crossover connections. This energetic preference dictates that the connecting loop or helix between two adjacent parallel strands will almost always cross over the top of the sheet in a right-handed manner.\n\n1.  The polypeptide chain begins with strand $\\beta_1$. This strand forms the center of one of the two $\\beta-\\alpha-\\beta$ motifs.\n2.  The chain then forms a helix ($\\alpha_A$) that connects the C-terminus of $\\beta_1$ to the N-terminus of $\\beta_2$. To make a right-handed connection, strand $\\beta_2$ must be placed adjacent to $\\beta_1$. Let's place $\\beta_2$ to the \"left\" of $\\beta_1$. The sheet arrangement so far is $\\beta_2 - \\beta_1$.\n3.  Next, another helix ($\\alpha_B$) connects the C-terminus of $\\beta_2$ to the N-terminus of $\\beta_3$. Following the same right-handed rule, $\\beta_3$ must be placed adjacent to and to the \"left\" of $\\beta_2$. The sheet arrangement for this first motif is now $\\beta_3 - \\beta_2 - \\beta_1$. Here, strand $\\beta_1$ is at the center of the sheet formed by this first half of the fold.\n\n4.  The polypeptide chain now continues to form the second half of the Rossmann fold. A connecting helix links the C-terminus of $\\beta_3$ to the N-terminus of $\\beta_4$. This connection is a longer crossover that brings the chain from the edge of the first motif (at $\\beta_3$) over to the other side of the central strand $\\beta_1$. The strand $\\beta_4$ is thus placed adjacent to $\\beta_1$ on its \"right\" side. The sheet now has the arrangement $\\beta_3 - \\beta_2 - \\beta_1 - \\beta_4$.\n\n5.  A helix ($\\alpha_D$) connects the C-terminus of $\\beta_4$ to the N-terminus of $\\beta_5$. Following the right-handed rule, $\\beta_5$ is placed adjacent to and to the \"right\" of $\\beta_4$. The sheet arrangement becomes $\\beta_3 - \\beta_2 - \\beta_1 - \\beta_4 - \\beta_5$.\n\n6.  Finally, a helix ($\\alpha_E$) connects the C-terminus of $\\beta_5$ to the N-terminus of $\\beta_6$. $\\beta_6$ is placed adjacent to and to the \"right\" of $\\beta_5$.\n\nCombining all the strands, the final spatial order across the entire six-stranded parallel $\\beta$-sheet, from one edge to the other, is $\\beta_3 - \\beta_2 - \\beta_1 - \\beta_4 - \\beta_5 - \\beta_6$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. $\\beta_1 - \\beta_2 - \\beta_3 - \\beta_4 - \\beta_5 - \\beta_6$: This represents a sequential arrangement, which is incorrect for a Rossmann fold due to the crossover connections.\nB. $\\beta_6 - \\beta_5 - \\beta_4 - \\beta_3 - \\beta_2 - \\beta_1$: This is the reverse of the sequential arrangement and is also incorrect.\nC. $\\beta_3 - \\beta_2 - \\beta_1 - \\beta_4 - \\beta_5 - \\beta_6$: This matches our derived structure. It shows the two $\\beta-\\alpha-\\beta$ motifs packed together, with strand $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_4$ in the middle of the sheet.\nD. $\\beta_1 - \\beta_3 - \\beta_5 - \\beta_2 - \\beta_4 - \\beta_6$: This is an incorrect jumbled order.\nE. $\\beta_2 - \\beta_1 - \\beta_3 - \\beta_5 - \\beta_4 - \\beta_6$: This is another incorrect jumbled order.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2146026"}, {"introduction": "Having established the overall topology, let's delve into the biophysical principles that make this structure stable.

This final practice uses a hypothetical mutagenesis experiment to explore why the specific sequence and structure of the Rossmann fold are critical for binding its nucleotide cofactor, NAD$^+$. It focuses on the crucial role of highly conserved glycine residues within the phosphate-binding loop, whose unique properties allow for the formation of a tight, precise binding pocket. Answering this question will demonstrate how even a single amino acid change at a critical position can have drastic functional consequences, highlighting the elegance of evolutionary molecular design [@problem_id:2145999].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a hypothetical bacterial dehydrogenase enzyme that utilizes Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide ($NAD^+$) as a cofactor. Sequence analysis reveals that the enzyme's $NAD^+$-binding domain contains a classic Rossmann fold. This fold features a highly conserved phosphate-binding loop, often called a P-loop or Walker A motif, with a consensus sequence of Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly, where X can be any amino acid. This loop is known to form a sharp turn that creates a specific pocket for the pyrophosphate group of $NAD^+$.\n\nTo investigate the role of this conserved sequence, the biochemist performs a site-directed mutagenesis experiment, replacing the first glycine residue of the Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif with a tryptophan residue. The resulting mutant enzyme is properly folded, but functional assays show its affinity for $NAD^+$ is virtually eliminated.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct and primary structural reason for this drastic loss of $NAD^+$ binding?\n\nA. The bulky side chain of tryptophan introduces severe steric hindrance within the tight phosphate-binding pocket, physically blocking the cofactor.\n\nB. The mutation from a nonpolar glycine to a polar tryptophan introduces an unfavorable positive charge into the binding site, which electrostatically repels the $NAD^+$ cofactor.\n\nC. The replacement of glycine removes a critical hydrogen bond donor from its side chain that is essential for coordinating with the negative charges of the phosphate groups.\n\nD. The substitution disrupts the hydrophobic core of the entire Rossmann fold, leading to global misfolding and inactivation of the enzyme.\n\nE. The aromatic ring of tryptophan engages in pi-stacking interactions with the protein backbone, overly stabilizing a non-functional loop conformation.", "solution": "The Rossmann fold phosphate-binding loop (Walker A/P-loop) uses the consensus Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly to create a tight turn that positions multiple backbone amide NH groups to hydrogen bond with the pyrophosphate of $NAD^+$. The glycine residues are critical because glycine lacks a side chain beyond hydrogen, allowing the loop to adopt sterically restricted backbone conformations and to pack extremely close to the phosphate groups without clashes. In this motif, phosphate coordination is dominated by backbone amide NH donors (and frequently a conserved Lys/Ser/Thr), not by glycine side chains.\n\nReplacing the first glycine with tryptophan introduces the bulkiest aromatic side chain at a position that must be sterically permissive. This substitution causes severe steric hindrance in the narrow phosphate-binding pocket and prevents the loop from adopting its native tight conformation and from positioning backbone NH groups appropriately for phosphate binding. The result is a drastic loss of $NAD^+$ affinity.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is correct: the bulky tryptophan side chain introduces steric clashes in a sterically constrained pocket, directly blocking or distorting pyrophosphate binding.\n- B is incorrect: tryptophan is neutral under physiological conditions; it does not introduce a positive charge that would repel $NAD^+$.\n- C is incorrect: glycine’s side chain does not supply a hydrogen bond donor; phosphate coordination arises from backbone amides and other residues.\n- D is inconsistent with the observation that the mutant is properly folded; the effect is local to the loop, not global misfolding.\n- E is speculative and not the primary structural cause; pi-stacking with the backbone is not a defining feature here, and steric hindrance is the dominant effect.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and primary structural reason is the steric hindrance introduced by tryptophan in the tight phosphate-binding loop.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2145999"}]}
