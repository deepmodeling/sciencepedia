[@problem_id:2110981]", "problem": "In a protein engineering experiment, a researcher synthesizes a large quantity of a short, purified polypeptide. Each chain consists of ten repeats of a specific tripeptide unit, resulting in the sequence (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10. Here, Pro represents Proline, Hyp represents 4-Hydroxyproline, and Gly represents Glycine. The researcher places these polypeptide chains in a neutral aqueous buffer at a physiological temperature to investigate whether they can spontaneously self-assemble into a stable, collagen-like triple helix structure, which is a right-handed superhelix composed of three left-handed polypeptide chains.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of protein structure, select the statement below that provides the most accurate prediction and correct biophysical justification for the behavior of these polypeptide chains.\n\nA. No, the polypeptide chains will not form a stable triple helix because the presence of Proline, a known alpha-helix breaker, would disrupt any regular helical structure required for assembly.\n\nB. Yes, the polypeptide chains will form a stable triple helix. This is because the sequence places the small Glycine residue at every third position, allowing it to fit into the sterically crowded core of the helix, while the Proline and Hydroxyproline residues promote the necessary helical twist and provide extensive inter-chain hydrogen bonding for stability.\n\nC. No, the polypeptide chains will not form a stable triple helix because the a-carbons of Glycine are too flexible, which would prevent the chains from adopting the rigid conformation needed for the structure.\n\nD. Yes, the polypeptide chains will form a stable triple helix, but only if an enzyme is added to convert all the Proline residues to Hydroxyproline, as a stable structure requires the maximum possible number of hydroxyl groups for hydrogen bonding.", "solution": "Goal: Determine whether the polypeptide sequence $(\\text{Pro-Hyp-Gly})_{10}$ will spontaneously form a stable collagen-like triple helix in neutral aqueous buffer at physiological temperature, and select the option with the most accurate prediction and correct biophysical justification.\n\nStep 1: Recall the fundamental structural requirement for collagen triple helix formation. Collagen triple helices are composed of three left-handed chains that supercoil into a right-handed triple helix. A key sequence motif is the repeat Gly-X-Y, where Gly appears at every third residue. Glycine, being the smallest residue, is essential at every third position to occupy the sterically constrained core of the triple helix. The X and Y positions commonly contain Proline and 4-Hydroxyproline, respectively.\n\nStep 2: Map the given sequence to the collagen motif. The sequence $(\\text{Pro-Hyp-Gly})_{10}$ is equivalent to the canonical Gly-X-Y pattern when read in triplets: each triplet ends in Gly, so Gly occupies every third position. Thus, the chain has the required Gly periodicity. Moreover, the X position is Pro and the Y position is Hyp, which is the most stabilizing natural motif in collagen-like peptides.\n\nStep 3: Biophysical roles of Pro and Hyp. Proline and Hydroxyproline promote the polyproline II-like conformation needed for each chain and preorganize the backbone via ring constraints and stereoelectronic effects, thereby increasing the entropy-favored preorganization and overall stability of the triple helix. Hydroxyproline, in particular, stabilizes the triple helix through stereoelectronic effects that favor the trans peptide bond and specific ring puckers, and through hydration networks; it is not primarily required to maximize direct inter-chain hydrogen bonds.\n\nStep 4: Hydrogen bonding pattern. The principal inter-chain hydrogen bonds in the collagen triple helix are formed by the amide hydrogen of Gly at position i in one chain donating to a carbonyl oxygen (typically of the X position) on an adjacent chain. Proline and Hydroxyproline residues do not donate main-chain amide hydrogens at those positions (Pro lacks an amide hydrogen), so they are not the primary providers of inter-chain hydrogen bonding, although their presence promotes the correct geometry for hydrogen bonding and enhances stability.\n\nStep 5: Length and conditions. Synthetic peptides consisting of approximately ten Gly-X-Y repeats are sufficient to form stable triple helices, especially when X and Y are Pro and Hyp, under neutral aqueous conditions near physiological temperature.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the options.\n- Option A is incorrect: Proline disrupts alpha-helices, but collagen is not an alpha-helix; Pro and Hyp actually favor collagen triple-helix formation.\n- Option B correctly predicts triple-helix formation and correctly cites glycine at every third position and the role of Pro/Hyp in promoting the necessary conformation. The clause stating that Pro/Hyp provide extensive inter-chain hydrogen bonding is imprecise, as the key inter-chain donors are the Gly amide hydrogens; however, among the given choices, this option best captures the essential requirements and provides the closest correct biophysical justification.\n- Option C is incorrect: Glycine’s small size and conformational freedom are required for fitting into the crowded core; flexibility does not prevent triple-helix formation.\n- Option D is incorrect: Hydroxylation enhances stability but is not strictly required, and conversion of all Pro to Hyp is unnecessary; triple helices form without complete hydroxylation.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate prediction with the closest correct justification is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2110981"}, {"introduction": "The formation of functional tissues requires not only the folding of individual protein molecules but also their precise assembly into larger, hierarchical structures. This practice explores the critical process of collagen fibrillogenesis, where precursor molecules are modified to enable their assembly. By considering a scenario where this process is disrupted, you will see how cleavage of propeptides acts as a crucial regulatory switch, illustrating a common principle in biology where protein function is controlled through post-translational processing. [@problem_id:2110975]", "problem": "In the extracellular matrix, the structural protein collagen provides immense tensile strength. Its fundamental unit, the tropocollagen molecule, is a rigid, rod-like triple helix. This molecule is initially synthesized and folded inside the cell as a larger precursor called procollagen. Procollagen possesses additional globular domains at its ends, known as the N-terminal and C-terminal propeptides. After secretion from the cell, these propeptides are normally cleaved by specific enzymes, yielding mature tropocollagen molecules that can then self-assemble into large, ordered structures called collagen fibrils.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in a developing connective tissue where the enzymes responsible for cleaving both the N- and C-terminal propeptides from procollagen are non-functional due to a genetic defect. Which of the following options describes the most direct and significant structural consequence of this enzymatic failure on the formation of the collagen network in the extracellular matrix?\n\nA. The individual procollagen molecules will be unable to assemble into organized, staggered collagen fibrils.\n\nB. The initial formation of the triple helix structure from three individual alpha-chains will be prevented inside the cell.\n\nC. The procollagen molecules will assemble into fibrils that are much thicker and less organized than normal collagen fibrils.\n\nD. The procollagen molecules will fail to be secreted from the cell into the extracellular matrix.\n\nE. The covalent cross-links between adjacent collagen molecules will form prematurely, resulting in a brittle matrix.", "solution": "Identify the normal sequence of collagen biosynthesis and assembly:\n- Inside the cell, three procollagen $\\alpha$-chains form a triple helix, guided by the C-terminal propeptide. This step does not require extracellular propeptide-cleaving enzymes.\n- Procollagen is secreted into the extracellular matrix, where specific N- and C-procollagen peptidases cleave the terminal propeptides.\n- Removal of both propeptides exposes the sticky, rod-like tropocollagen, allowing lateral assembly into staggered collagen fibrils, followed by covalent cross-linking mediated by lysyl oxidase.\n\nState the defect and its immediate biochemical consequence:\n- In the hypothetical scenario, both N- and C-terminal propeptides are not cleaved due to non-functional enzymes.\n- Therefore, procollagen retains its terminal propeptides after secretion.\n\nInfer the direct structural impact on fibrillogenesis:\n- Retained propeptides sterically and electrostatically hinder the lateral aggregation necessary for the staggered alignment of tropocollagen into fibrils.\n- As a result, the fundamental step of fibril assembly fails; mature, organized collagen fibrils do not form.\n\nEvaluate each option against the mechanism:\n- Option A: Correct. Without propeptide removal, procollagen cannot assemble into organized, staggered collagen fibrils.\n- Option B: Incorrect. Triple helix formation occurs intracellularly and precedes extracellular propeptide cleavage; it is not prevented by the extracellular enzyme defect.\n- Option C: Incorrect. The defect blocks fibril assembly rather than producing thicker fibrils.\n- Option D: Incorrect. Procollagen is typically secreted; the propeptides actually enhance solubility, so secretion is not the blocked step here.\n- Option E: Incorrect. Cross-linking requires proper fibril assembly and lysyl oxidase; with propeptides intact, alignment is impaired and cross-links do not form prematurely.\n\nThus, the most direct and significant structural consequence is failure of fibril assembly.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2110975"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a protein's structure also means understanding its limits, such as how it responds to changes like heat.
