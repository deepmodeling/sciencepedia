In a β-sheet, the constituent β-strands are characterized by a repeating pattern where the side chains of adjacent amino acid residues point in opposite directions relative to the plane of the sheet.\n\nConsider a seven-residue peptide segment, `Val-Thr-Leu-Thr-Cys-Leu-Ile`, which forms a single β-strand that is part of one of the β-sheets in an Ig-like domain. The side chain of the first residue, Valine (Val), is oriented inward, pointing directly into the hydrophobic core of the protein. The relevant amino acids have the following properties: Valine (Val), Leucine (Leu), and Isoleucine (Ile) are strongly hydrophobic; Threonine (Thr) is polar; Cysteine (Cys) is also generally hydrophobic and is frequently found within the core of Ig domains.\n\nBased on the principle of alternating side-chain orientation in a β-strand, which of the following choices correctly identifies the complete set of residues from this segment that are buried in the hydrophobic core?\n\nA.

This exercise uses a thought experiment involving site-directed mutagenesis to explore the thermodynamic consequences of breaking this bond. By predicting the change in the protein's melting temperature ($T_m$), you will gain insight into how covalent cross-links contribute to overall protein stability, primarily through their effect on the entropy of the unfolded state.", "problem": "The Immunoglobulin (Ig) domain is one of the most common protein folds found in nature, forming the basis for antibodies and a vast array of cell surface receptors. The canonical Ig domain structure consists of a beta-sandwich, where two anti-parallel beta-sheets are packed against each other. A key, highly conserved feature of most Ig domains is a single intradomain disulfide bond that covalently links a cysteine residue on one beta-sheet to a cysteine residue on the other, effectively \"stapling\" the sandwich together.\n\nThe thermal stability of a protein is often characterized by its melting temperature ($T_m$), which is the temperature at which 50% of the protein population is in the denatured (unfolded) state. A higher $T_m$ indicates greater stability.\n\nImagine a biochemical experiment where a specific Ig domain is subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. One of the two conserved cysteine residues forming the disulfide bond is mutated to an alanine residue. Alanine is a small, non-polar amino acid that cannot form disulfide bonds.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the effect of this Cys-to-Ala mutation on the structural integrity and melting temperature ($T_m$) of the Ig domain, compared to the wild-type (unmutated) protein?\n\nA. The protein will likely still fold into a recognizably correct beta-sandwich structure, but its thermodynamic stability will be significantly reduced, resulting in a lower melting temperature ($T_m$).\n\nB. The protein will be completely unable to fold into the correct beta-sandwich structure and will primarily exist as an unfolded random coil at physiological temperatures.\n\nC. The melting temperature ($T_m$) of the protein will increase because breaking the rigid covalent disulfide bond allows the beta-sheets more conformational freedom to form stronger, more optimal hydrophobic interactions.\n\nD. The overall structure and the melting temperature ($T_m$) will be virtually unchanged because the hydrophobic interactions between the beta-sheets are the sole determinants of the protein's fold and stability.\n\nE. The protein will fold correctly into two separate beta-sheets, but these sheets will no longer associate with each other to form the beta-sandwich and will exist as independent structures in solution.", "solution": "We consider the Ig domain as a two-state folder with folded (F) and unfolded (U) states in equilibrium. The thermodynamic stability is governed by the Gibbs free energy change on folding,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{fold}} - T \\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}.\n$$\nAt the melting temperature, by definition, the populations of F and U are equal, so the equilibrium constant is $K=1$, which implies\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(T_{m}) = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad T_{m} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{fold}}}{\\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}}.\n$$\nA covalent disulfide bond within a domain acts as an intramolecular crosslink that reduces the conformational entropy of the unfolded ensemble. In folding thermodynamics, the entropic term is dominated by the loss of conformational entropy upon folding, so $\\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}<0$. Introducing a disulfide reduces the magnitude of the entropic penalty, making $\\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}$ less negative (i.e., increases $\\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}$ toward zero), which stabilizes the folded state (more negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ at a given $T$) and increases $T_{m}$ if $\\Delta H_{\\text{fold}}$ is approximately unchanged.\n\nConversely, mutating one cysteine to alanine eliminates the disulfide, increasing the conformational entropy of the unfolded state and thereby making the entropic penalty of folding larger in magnitude. In the sign convention above, this makes $\\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}$ more negative. With $\\Delta H_{\\text{fold}}$ not dramatically compensated, the ratio $\\Delta H_{\\text{fold}}/\\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}$ decreases in magnitude, so\n$$\nT_{m,\\ \\text{mut}} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{fold, mut}}}{\\Delta S_{\\text{fold, mut}}} < \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{fold, WT}}}{\\Delta S_{\\text{fold, WT}}} = T_{m,\\ \\text{WT}},\n$$\npredicting a lower melting temperature for the mutant.\n\nStructurally, the Ig beta-sandwich is also stabilized by hydrogen bonding within beta-sheets and hydrophobic packing between sheets. While the disulfide is a conserved stabilizing element, many Ig-like domains can still adopt a recognizably correct fold without it, albeit with reduced thermodynamic stability and increased susceptibility to unfolding and aggregation. Therefore, complete inability to fold is unlikely in general, and claims that $T_{m}$ increases or remains unchanged contradict the thermodynamic role of the disulfide crosslink. The notion that the two beta-sheets would exist as independent structures in solution is incompatible with a single polypeptide chain and the cooperative nature of the fold.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is that the domain can still fold into a recognizably correct beta-sandwich but with significantly reduced stability and a lower $T_{m}$ compared to wild type.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2144237"}, {"introduction": "The integrity of the hydrophobic core is paramount, but not all disruptions are created equal. This final practice delves deeper into the principles of protein stability by asking you to evaluate the impact of various mutations on a critical, buried tryptophan residue.

The stability of this fold relies heavily on a well-packed hydrophobic core between the two sheets. A key residue in many Ig domains is a tryptophan that is completely buried within this core, its large indole side chain making extensive van der Waals contacts with surrounding non-polar residues, acting as a structural pin.\n\nAn investigator is studying the structural importance of this buried tryptophan (Trp) in a specific Ig domain.

The buried Trp contributes primarily through the hydrophobic effect and tight van der Waals packing within the core between the two antiparallel beta-sheets.

This reduces $\\Delta G_{\\text{lost VDW}}$ somewhat and introduces a modest $\\Delta G_{\\text{cavity}}$, but $\\Delta G_{\\text{electrostatic}} \\approx 0$ and $\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv}} \\approx 0$ remain minimal due to hydrophobic character. This is expected to be among the least destabilizing substitutions.\n\n- Trp to Leu: Leucine is hydrophobic but aliphatic and smaller. This increases $\\Delta G_{\\text{cavity}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\text{lost VDW}}$ relative to Phe, but still no significant $\\Delta G_{\\text{electrostatic}}$ or $\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv}}$. Destabilizing, but typically less than introducing a polar/charged residue.\n\n- Trp to Asp: Aspartate introduces a carboxylate group that is ionized at neutral pH in solution. Burying an ionizable group in the hydrophobic core incurs a very large positive $\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv}}$ and unfavorable $\\Delta G_{\\text{electrostatic}}$ unless there are compensating hydrogen bonds or salt bridges, which are not expected at a site optimized for a bulky hydrophobe.

Therefore,\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G(\\text{Asp}) \\gg \\Delta \\Delta G(\\text{hydrophobics}),\n$$\nmaking this the most destabilizing among the listed options.\n\n- Trp to Gly: Glycine removes nearly all side-chain bulk, creating a large cavity (large $\\Delta G_{\\text{cavity}}$) and losing extensive van der Waals contacts (large $\\Delta G_{\\text{lost VDW}}$). It may also alter local backbone preferences ($\\Delta G_{\\text{conformational}}$) by increasing flexibility. However, it does not introduce a buried polar or charged group, so $\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv}} \\approx 0$. Although strongly destabilizing, this is generally less unfavorable than burying a charged residue.\n\n- Trp to Met: Methionine is hydrophobic and relatively bulky, offering decent core packing with smaller $\\Delta G_{\\text{cavity}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\text{lost VDW}}$ than Leu or Gly, and with negligible $\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv}}$. This is destabilizing but moderate.\n\nRanking by expected destabilization based on fundamental principles of hydrophobic core packing and desolvation penalties:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G(\\text{Asp}) \\gg \\Delta \\Delta G(\\text{Gly}) > \\Delta \\Delta G(\\text{Leu}) \\approx \\Delta \\Delta G(\\text{Met}) > \\Delta \\Delta G(\\text{Phe}).\n$$\nTherefore, the most destabilizing mutation is Trp to Aspartate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2144224"}]}
