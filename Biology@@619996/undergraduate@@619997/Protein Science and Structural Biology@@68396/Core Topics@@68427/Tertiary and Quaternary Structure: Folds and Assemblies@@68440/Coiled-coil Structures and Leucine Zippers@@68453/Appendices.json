Its primary amino acid sequence, given in single-letter code from the N-terminus to the C-terminus, is:\n\n`LEKVAQILNLEKEMSQIVD`\n\nThis peptide is hypothesized to be involved in forming a stable protein complex. To understand its structural properties, you are asked to analyze its sequence. Assume that if the peptide forms a helical structure, it will be an alpha-helix, which is characterized by having 7 amino acid residues for every 2 full turns.\n\nFor your analysis, the properties of the relevant amino acids are provided:\n*   **Nonpolar, Hydrophobic**: Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), Methionine (M), Alanine (A)\n*   **Polar, Uncharged**: Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q), Serine (S)\n*   **Positively Charged (Basic)**: Lysine (K), Arginine (R)\n*   **Negatively Charged (Acidic)**: Aspartic Acid (D), Glutamic Acid (E)\n\nBased on the arrangement of amino acids in its sequence, which of the following statements most accurately describes the likely structural behavior of the Extremo-dimerin peptide in a typical aqueous buffer?\n\nA. The peptide is likely to form an alpha-helix that associates with another identical helix to form a dimeric coiled-coil structure.\n\nB. The peptide is likely to form a stable, monomeric alpha-helix that does not associate with other peptides.\n\nC. The peptide is likely to adopt a beta-sheet conformation, stabilized by hydrogen bonds between adjacent peptide strands.\n\nD. The peptide is likely to remain as a structurally undefined, random coil due to its short length and mix of residue types.\n\nE. Although it forms an alpha-helix, its hydrophobic residues are distributed randomly around the helical axis, allowing it to be soluble as a monomer.", "solution": "The key to solving this problem is to analyze the periodicity of the amino acid properties along the peptide sequence, in the context of an alpha-helical structure. A repeating pattern of 7 amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, is the fundamental unit for analyzing interactions between such helices. A heptad repeat is conventionally denoted by the letters `(abcdefg)n`.\n\nStructures known as \"coiled-coils\" or \"leucine zippers\" are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between two or more alpha-helices. This interaction is mediated by a specific arrangement where the residues at positions `a` and `d` of the heptad repeat are predominantly nonpolar and hydrophobic. These residues form a \"hydrophobic stripe\" along one face of the helix.\n\nLet's map the given peptide sequence to the heptad repeat positions:\nSequence:    `L E K V A Q I L N L E K E M S Q I V D`\nPosition #:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19\nHeptad pos:  `a b c d e f g a b c d e f  g  a  b  c  d  e`\n\nNow, we identify the residues at the critical `a` and `d` positions:\n*   **Residues at position `a`**:\n    *   Position 1: `L` (Leucine)\n    *   Position 8: `L` (Leucine)\n    *   Position 15: `M` (Methionine)\n*   **Residues at position `d`**:\n    *   Position 4: `V` (Valine)\n    *   Position 11: `L` (Leucine)\n    *   Position 18: `V` (Valine)\n\nAll the residues at the `a` and `d` positions (L, L, M and V, L, V) are nonpolar and hydrophobic. When this peptide folds into an alpha-helix, these residues align to form a continuous hydrophobic stripe on one face. An exposed hydrophobic surface is thermodynamically unstable in an aqueous solution. To minimize contact with water, two such helices will associate, burying their hydrophobic faces together at the interface. This creates a stable, intertwined coiled-coil.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n*   **A. The peptide is likely to form an alpha-helix that associates with another identical helix to form a dimeric coiled-coil structure.** This matches our conclusion. The hydrophobic stripe drives dimerization.\n*   **B. The peptide is likely to form a stable, monomeric alpha-helix...** This is incorrect because a monomeric helix would leave the hydrophobic stripe exposed to the solvent, which is energetically unfavorable.\n*   **C. The peptide is likely to adopt a beta-sheet conformation...** This is incorrect. The heptad repeat is the signature of an alpha-helical coiled-coil, not a beta-sheet.\n*   **D. The peptide is likely to remain as a structurally undefined, random coil...** This is incorrect. The strong, regular pattern of hydrophobic residues provides a powerful thermodynamic driving force for folding.\n*   **E. Although it forms an alpha-helix, its hydrophobic residues are distributed randomly...** This is incorrect. The hydrophobic residues are arranged in a specific, non-random pattern.\n\nTherefore, the formation of a dimeric coiled-coil is the most accurate prediction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2105802"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply forming a coiled-coil, the specific arrangement of helices is governed by subtle interactions. While hydrophobic residues at the core positions $a$ and $d$ provide the primary driving force for assembly, charged residues at the flanking $e$ and $g$ positions often act as 'steering' elements. This practice [@problem_id:2105806] demonstrates how the strategic placement of acidic and basic residues can create electrostatic salt bridges that determine the final orientation of the helices, a key principle in designing predictable protein architectures.", "problem": "Coiled-coils are a common structural motif in proteins, where two or more alpha-helices twist around each other to form a stable supercoil. The primary sequence of proteins that form coiled-coils often exhibits a characteristic seven-residue pattern known as a heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. In a canonical coiled-coil, the residues at positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic and pack together to form a buried core. The residues at positions `e` and `g`, which flank the hydrophobic core, are often charged and can form stabilizing or destabilizing electrostatic interactions between helices.\n\nConsider a synthetic peptide with the repeating sequence `(LEALEGK)n`, which is known to be highly alpha-helical in solution.

Here, $a=\\mathrm{L}$ and $d=\\mathrm{L}$, giving a strong hydrophobic stripe that disfavors exposure to water and thus promotes oligomerization via a coiled-coil rather than a monomeric helix.\n- Positions $e$ and $g$ flank the core and often form interhelical electrostatic pairs. At neutral pH, $\\mathrm{E}$ is negatively charged (denote $\\mathrm{E}^{-}$) and $\\mathrm{K}$ is positively charged (denote $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$). Thus $e=\\mathrm{E}^{-}$ and $g=\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ provide complementary charges.\n\nOrientation determination by electrostatics:\n- In a parallel two-helix coiled-coil, the geometric register places $g$ of one helix opposite $e'$ of the partner and $e$ opposite $g'$ (where primes denote the facing positions on the partner helix). Therefore, the interhelical pairs are $g^{+}\\leftrightarrow e'^{-}$ and $e^{-}\\leftrightarrow g'^{+}$, both attractive salt bridges that stabilize the interface.\n- In an antiparallel two-helix coiled-coil, the register places like positions opposite each other across the interface, leading to $e^{-}\\leftrightarrow e'^{-}$ and $g^{+}\\leftrightarrow g'^{+}$, which are electrostatically repulsive and thus destabilizing.\n\nOligomeric state:\n- The presence of leucine at both $a$ and $d$ positions is characteristic of leucine zippers, which predominantly form dimers due to favorable knobs-into-holes packing in a two-helix interface. Trimers or higher oligomers typically require different core residue patterns at $a$ and $d$ to alter the supercoil geometry and packing; the given $a/d=\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{L}$ pattern most strongly supports a dimer.\n- A monomeric alpha-helix would expose the hydrophobic $a/d$ stripe to solvent and is disfavored in aqueous solution. A random coil is inconsistent with the high alpha-helical propensity of leucine, alanine, glutamate, and lysine, and with the designed heptad pattern promoting coiled-coils.\n\nTherefore, the most stable assembly at neutral pH is a parallel coiled-coil dimer stabilized by complementary $e/g$ interhelical salt bridges and a leucine-based $a/d$ hydrophobic core.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2105806"}, {"introduction": "Protein design often requires moving beyond qualitative predictions to quantitative assessment of interaction specificity.
