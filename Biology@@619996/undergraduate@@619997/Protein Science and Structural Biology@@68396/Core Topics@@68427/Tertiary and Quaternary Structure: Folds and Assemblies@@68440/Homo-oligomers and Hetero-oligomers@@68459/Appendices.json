This first practice explores the hydrophobic effect, one of the most powerful driving forces in structural biology. By considering a hypothetical mutagenesis experiment, you will deduce the dominant interactions that stabilize a protein complex, sharpening your intuition for how a protein's sequence dictates its quaternary structure in an aqueous environment [@problem_id:2113576].", "problem": "A hypothetical protein, called Quartzin, naturally assembles into a stable homo-tetramer, which is a complex formed by four identical protein subunits. Biophysical analysis reveals that the interfaces where these subunits contact each other are predominantly lined with non-polar amino acid residues. A scientist uses site-directed mutagenesis to create a mutant version of Quartzin. In this mutant, a single leucine residue, located at the very center of a subunit-subunit interface, is replaced with an aspartate residue. When this mutant protein is placed in a buffered aqueous solution at physiological pH, it fails to form the tetramer and exists solely as monomers.\n\nBased on this experimental observation, which of the following is the most significant stabilizing interaction responsible for the assembly of the wild-type Quartzin homo-tetramer?\n\nA. Covalent disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues on adjacent subunits.\n\nB. A network of salt bridges involving electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged residues at the interface.\n\nC. The hydrophobic effect, which drives the association of non-polar surfaces to minimize their contact with water.\n\nD. An extensive array of hydrogen bonds between polar, uncharged residues at the interface.\n\nE. Coordination of a divalent metal cation that bridges the subunits.", "solution": "We are told the wild-type homo-tetramer interface is predominantly non-polar and that replacing a central leucine (hydrophobic, uncharged) with an aspartate (charged, polar at physiological pH due to deprotonated side chain carboxylate) abolishes tetramerization in aqueous buffer at physiological pH. The key physical principle is the hydrophobic effect: non-polar surfaces tend to associate to minimize exposure to water, reducing the ordering of surrounding water and lowering the free energy. Burial of non-polar side chains at a proteinâ€“protein interface is stabilized largely by this effect and by van der Waals packing.\n\nIntroducing a charged residue (aspartate) at the center of a hydrophobic interface imposes a large desolvation penalty and creates an unfavorable energetic environment for a charged group in a non-polar context, thereby destabilizing the interface and preventing oligomerization. This specific sensitivity to replacing a hydrophobic residue with a charged residue at the interface strongly implicates hydrophobic interactions as the dominant stabilizing force.\n\nWe evaluate the options:\n- A: Disulfide bonds are covalent and would not be disrupted by a single Leu to Asp substitution unless cysteines were directly involved. The description emphasizes non-polar interfaces rather than cysteine-mediated covalent crosslinks, so this is inconsistent.\n- B: Salt bridges require complementary charged residues; a non-polar interface argues against a dense network of salt bridges. Moreover, introducing a negatively charged aspartate could, in principle, create rather than abolish a salt bridge if positives were present; the observed disruption argues the interface was not stabilized primarily by salt bridges.\n- C: The hydrophobic effect matches both observations: a non-polar interface and disruption upon introducing a polar/charged residue centrally.\n- D: Hydrogen bond networks would suggest many polar, uncharged residues at the interface, which contradicts the stated predominance of non-polar residues.\n- E: Metal coordination typically involves residues such as His, Asp, or Glu; a predominantly non-polar interface and a central leucine are inconsistent with metal-mediated assembly. Introducing Asp would more likely create a potential metal-binding site rather than eliminate an existing one.\n\nTherefore, the most significant stabilizing interaction is the hydrophobic effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2113576"}, {"introduction": "Building on the forces that hold oligomers together, we now turn to the combinatorial possibilities when different subunits are present.

The analysis reveals the presence of four distinct species corresponding to monomers ($M$), dimers ($D$), trimers ($T$), and tetramers ($Q$).\n\nThe self-assembly mechanism is well-described by a linear, sequential monomer addition model, with the following elementary steps:\n1.  $M + M \\rightleftharpoons D$\n2.  $D + M \\rightleftharpoons T$\n3.  $T + M \\rightleftharpoons Q$\n\nThe equilibrium association constants for these reaction steps are defined as $K_{a1} = \\frac{[D]}{[M]^2}$, $K_{a2} = \\frac{[T]}{[D][M]}$, and $K_{a3} = \\frac{[Q]}{[T][M]}$, where square brackets denote molar concentrations of the respective species at equilibrium.\n\nQuantitative analysis of the mass photometry data indicates that the molar concentration of the dimer species is 18.0 times the molar concentration of the trimer species.
