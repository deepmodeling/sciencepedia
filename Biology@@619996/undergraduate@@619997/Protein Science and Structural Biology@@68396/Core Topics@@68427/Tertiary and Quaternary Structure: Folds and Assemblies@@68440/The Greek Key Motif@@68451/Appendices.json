The specific three-dimensional arrangement of these strands is known as the sheet's topology. We can represent this topology with a simple notation. If we number the beta-strands sequentially (1, 2, 3, ..., n) as they appear along the polypeptide chain from the N-terminus to the C-terminus, the topology can be described by listing these numbers in the order that the strands are arranged spatially in the final, hydrogen-bonded sheet. For example, in a four-strand sheet, the topology '1-2-3-4' indicates that strand 1 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 2, strand 2 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 3, and strand 3 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 4, forming a simple sequential arrangement.\n\nThe Greek key motif is a particularly stable and widespread supersecondary structure composed of four adjacent antiparallel beta-strands.

The notation describes the spatial arrangement of beta-strands in a sheet, where the strands are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 according to their order in the primary amino acid sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the definition of a Greek key motif and then evaluate each option. A Greek key motif is formed from four antiparallel beta-strands. The characteristic feature is the path the polypeptide chain takes to connect these strands. In a typical Greek key, two hairpins are formed by sequentially adjacent strands (e.g., 1 and 2, and 3 and 4, or 2 and 3), but the connection between these hairpin pairs involves a long loop that \"folds over\" the structure. This fold-over is what creates the namesake pattern.\n\nLet's trace the path for each option to see if it matches this description.\n\n**Option A: 1-2-3-4**\nIn this topology, strand 1 is adjacent to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4.\n- The connection from strand 1 to 2 is a short loop (hairpin).\n- The connection from strand 2 to 3 is a short loop (hairpin).\n- The connection from strand 3 to 4 is a short loop (hairpin).\nThe polypeptide chain simply goes \"up-and-down\" along the sheet. There is no long crossover loop. This topology is known as a simple up-and-down beta-sheet, not a Greek key.\n\n**Option B: 1-3-4-2**\nIn this topology, the hydrogen bonding pairs are (1,3), (3,4), and (4,2).\n- The connection from strand 1 to 2 requires a long loop that must span across strands 3 and 4.\n- The connection from strand 2 to 3 is a short loop.\n- The connection from strand 3 to 4 is a short loop (hairpin).\nThis topology is complex but does not match the typical pattern of a Greek key, which usually involves two hairpins connected in a specific folded-over manner. It is sometimes referred to as a \"psi-loop\" ($\\psi$-loop) connection.\n\n**Option C: 3-2-1-4**\nIn this topology, the hydrogen bonding pairs are (3,2), (2,1), and (1,4). Let's trace the connections made by the polypeptide chain:\n- The chain first forms strand 1.\n- To form the adjacent strand 2, the polypeptide must make a short turn (hairpin). Now we have a 2-1 unit.\n- To form strand 3, which is adjacent to strand 2, the chain makes another short turn (hairpin). Now we have the 3-2-1 unit of the sheet.\n- Finally, to form strand 4 adjacent to strand 1, the chain must make a long connection, looping over the top of the entire 3-2-1 structure.\nThis path, with the long crossover loop connecting strand 3 to strand 4, is the defining characteristic of a Greek key motif. When drawn in a 2D topology diagram, the polypeptide path clearly resembles the classic Greek key pattern. Therefore, this is a correct representation.\n\n**Option D: 1-4-2-3**\nIn this topology, the hydrogen bonding pairs are (1,4), (4,2), and (2,3).\n- The connection from strand 1 to 2 requires a long loop spanning strand 4.\n- The connection from strand 2 to 3 is a short loop (hairpin).\n- The connection from strand 3 to 4 requires a long loop spanning strand 2.\nThis involves two long loops and one hairpin, which is not the structure of a standard Greek key motif.\n\nBased on the analysis, the topology notation `3-2-1-4` correctly describes the spatial arrangement and polypeptide path of a canonical Greek key motif.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2143012"}, {"introduction": "Now that you can identify a Greek key by its topology, let's explore how a polypeptide chain achieves this non-intuitive fold.

Consider a hypothetical polypeptide chain that folds into a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. The strands are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 according to their sequential order along the primary sequence of the polypeptide.\n\nInitially, the strands form a simple \"up-and-down\" topology, consisting of two adjacent hairpin turns. In this configuration, the strands are arranged spatially side-by-side in the numerical order [1, 2, 3, 4], meaning strand 1 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 2, strand 2 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 3, and strand 3 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 4.\n\nThe problem asks you to identify the specific topological feature that distinguishes a classic Greek key motif from this simple up-and-down beta-sheet. For a Greek key motif, the spatial arrangement of the same four strands is [4, 1, 2, 3]. Which of the following statements accurately describes the necessary feature of the polypeptide chain's fold to achieve this Greek key topology, starting from the same primary sequence?\n\nA. The connecting loop between strand 3 and strand 4 must be a long crossover connection that allows strand 4 to be positioned adjacent to strand 1.\n\nB. All four beta-strands must change from an antiparallel to a parallel orientation relative to one another.\n\nC. The order of the strands in the primary sequence must be physically rearranged from (1, 2, 3, 4) to (4, 1, 2, 3) through a post-translational modification.\n\nD. The connecting loop between strand 1 and strand 2 must be significantly elongated to allow strand 1 to hydrogen-bond with strand 4.\n\nE. The connecting loop between strand 2 and strand 3 must be cleaved, and the two resulting dipeptides (1-2 and 3-4) re-associate to form the Greek key.", "solution": "We begin by formalizing the initial and target strand organizations in terms of sequence connectivity and sheet adjacency.\n\nBy assumption, the four strands are antiparallel and ordered in the primary sequence as 1, 2, 3, 4. In the simple up-and-down topology, the spatial arrangement is [1, 2, 3, 4], which means the antiparallel hydrogen-bond adjacency pairs are (1–2), (2–3), and (3–4). In antiparallel beta-sheets, adjacent strands are most commonly connected by short hairpin loops; thus, the up-and-down sheet implies that the sequence connections 1–2, 2–3, and 3–4 can be realized as short hairpins that keep the same adjacent order in the sheet.\n\nThe Greek key target requires the spatial arrangement [4, 1, 2, 3]. In this arrangement, the antiparallel adjacency pairs are (4–1), (1–2), and (2–3). Notably, the sequence-neighbor pair 3–4 is no longer adjacent in the sheet; instead, strand 4 must be brought to the opposite edge so that it lies adjacent to strand 1. Therefore, compared to the up-and-down sheet, the key topological change is to remove the sheet-adjacency between 3 and 4 and instead create adjacency between 4 and 1.\n\nGiven that the primary sequence order is fixed as 1–2–3–4, the only way to achieve this reordering of sheet adjacency without altering primary sequence or strand orientation is through modifying the loop geometry, specifically the connection from strand 3 to strand 4. A short hairpin between 3 and 4 would force 3 and 4 to remain adjacent, which contradicts the Greek key adjacency pattern. Consequently, the 3–4 connection must be a long crossover loop that traverses across the existing sheet to place strand 4 on the far side next to strand 1. This is the characteristic feature of the classical Greek key motif: two short adjacent hairpins (typically 1–2 and 2–3) combined with a longer crossover connection that brings the last strand back alongside the first.\n\nWe now assess the options:\n- Option A states that the 3–4 connection must be a long crossover to position 4 adjacent to 1. This matches the required topological change and is the defining feature of the Greek key.\n- Option B requires switching to parallel orientation, which contradicts the problem statement that the motif is antiparallel and is unnecessary for the Greek key.\n- Option C suggests rearranging primary sequence order, which does not occur in normal folding and is not required for the Greek key.\n- Option D proposes elongating the 1–2 loop; this does not change the adjacency of 3–4 and would not, by itself, place 4 next to 1. It is not the defining or necessary change.\n- Option E proposes cleavage and re-association, which is not a feature of normal folding and is unnecessary.\n\nTherefore, the necessary topological feature is the long crossover connection between strands 3 and 4 that repositions strand 4 adjacent to strand 1, as described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2143024"}, {"introduction": "Our knowledge of protein topology is not just for classification; it is a powerful tool for protein engineering. This final practice asks you to solve a design puzzle: how can you force a protein that naturally forms a simple β-meander to fold into a Greek key? By strategically introducing a disulfide bond, you will learn to apply topological principles to manipulate and control protein structure, a core concept in modern synthetic biology [@problem_id:2143035].", "problem": "An engineered polypeptide is designed with four segments (S1, S2, S3, S4) predisposed to form antiparallel β-strands, connected by flexible loops (L1, L2, L3).

In its native state, this polypeptide folds into a simple β-meander, where the strands are arranged sequentially in the sheet, resulting in a strand order of S1-S2-S3-S4 with H-bonds between adjacent pairs (S1-S2, S2-S3, S3-S4).\n\nYour goal is to re-engineer this protein to force it to adopt a specific Greek key topology. The target Greek key motif has a strand arrangement in the final β-sheet of S4-S1-S2-S3 (i.e., S4 is H-bonded to S1, S1 to S2, and S2 to S3).

One cysteine in strand S1 and one in strand S3.", "solution": "The problem asks for the optimal placement of a disulfide bond to convert a four-stranded β-meander into a specific Greek key motif. This requires analyzing the topological differences between the two folds and determining which covalent constraint would most effectively favor the target structure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial and target topologies.**\n\nThe initial fold is a β-meander with a strand order of S1-S2-S3-S4 in the sheet. The chain connectivity is N-S1-L1-S2-L2-S3-L3-S4-C. In a meander, strands that are adjacent in sequence are also adjacent in the 3D structure. The loops L1, L2, and L3 are simple hairpin turns connecting adjacent strands. The strands S1 and S4 are at opposite ends of the sheet and are far apart.\n\nThe target fold is a Greek key with a strand order of S4-S1-S2-S3 in the sheet. The chain connectivity remains N-S1-L1-S2-L2-S3-L3-S4-C. Let's trace the path of the polypeptide chain to form this structure:\n- S1 is connected to S2 by loop L1. In the S4-S1-S2-S3 sheet, S1 and S2 are adjacent. Therefore, L1 is a short hairpin turn.\n- S2 is connected to S3 by loop L2. In the sheet, S2 and S3 are adjacent. Therefore, L2 is also a short hairpin turn.\n- S3 is connected to S4 by loop L3. In the sheet, S3 and S4 are at opposite ends, separated by S1 and S2. For S3 to connect to S4, the loop L3 must be a long connection that traverses across the top or bottom of the sheet, spanning the width of the S1-S2 pair.\n- The defining, non-local feature of this specific Greek key is that the first strand in the sequence (S1) is hydrogen-bonded to the last strand in the sequence (S4).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the engineering principle.**\n\nThe disulfide bond must introduce a covalent constraint that is satisfied in the target Greek key structure but is highly unfavorable or impossible to satisfy in the initial β-meander structure. By forming early in the folding process, this bond will bias the folding landscape, making the Greek key conformation energetically much more favorable than the meander. The most effective constraint will be one that directly enforces a key long-range interaction specific to the target fold.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the proposed placement strategies.**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on the principle above:\n\n*   **A. One cysteine in strand S1 and one in strand S2:** This disulfide bond would lock the S1-S2 hairpin. This hairpin exists in *both* the meander and the target Greek key. Therefore, this constraint does not provide any specific bias to favor the Greek key over the meander. It simply stabilizes a local structural element common to both.\n\n*   **B. One cysteine in loop L1 and one in loop L3:** In the target S4-S1-S2-S3 Greek key, L1 is a short hairpin between S1 and S2, while L3 is the long crossover loop connecting S3 to S4. These two loops are located on opposite sides of the β-sheet. Bringing them together to form a disulfide bond would be sterically difficult and is inconsistent with the target topology. This placement would likely prevent the formation of the desired Greek key.\n\n*   **C. One cysteine in strand S2 and one in strand S4:** In the target S4-S1-S2-S3 sheet, S2 and S4 are not adjacent. They are separated by strand S1. Placing a disulfide bond between them would force an unnatural and strained conformation, which is incompatible with the target fold.\n\n*   **D. One cysteine in strand S1 and one in strand S4:** This strategy places a covalent link between the first and the last strands of the four-strand motif.\n    - In the initial β-meander, S1 and S4 are at opposite ends of the sheet and are spatially distant. Forming a disulfide bond between them would require a massive, energetically costly distortion of the meander fold, effectively preventing its formation.\n    - In the target S4-S1-S2-S3 Greek key, S1 and S4 are adjacent and form the central hydrogen-bonding interface of the sheet. Placing a disulfide bond between the interacting faces of S1 and S4 would directly and strongly stabilize this defining non-local interaction.\n    - Therefore, this constraint perfectly satisfies our engineering principle: it destabilizes the default fold while stabilizing the target fold. It forces the N-terminal and C-terminal strands of the motif to associate, which is the quintessential event in forming this type of Greek key.\n\n*   **E. One cysteine in strand S1 and one in strand S3:** In the target S4-S1-S2-S3 sheet, S1 and S3 are not adjacent; they are separated by S2. A disulfide bond between S1 and S3 would be incompatible with the hydrogen bonding pattern of the target structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most strategic and effective placement is to introduce the cysteine residues in strand S1 and strand S4. This creates a powerful topological constraint that prevents the formation of the default meander and directly promotes the key long-range interaction required for the formation of the desired S4-S1-S2-S3 Greek key motif.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2143035"}]}
