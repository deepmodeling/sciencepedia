Each residue contributes a length $d$ to the total length $L$. Therefore, the total length is the product of the number of residues and the axial rise per residue.\n\nThe formula for the total length is:\n$$L = N \\times d$$\n\nThe number of residues per turn, $n=3.6$, is a characteristic property of the $\\alpha$-helix that defines its pitch (the length of one full turn), but it is not directly needed to calculate the total length of the helix given the number of residues. The pitch, $P$, would be $P = n \\times d = 3.6 \\times 0.15 \\text{ nm} = 0.54 \\text{ nm}$, but the total length is independent of the number of turns.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the length equation:\n$$L = 45 \\times 0.15 \\text{ nm}$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$L = 6.75 \\text{ nm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

This final practice, [@problem_id:2135532], delves into the critical concept of amino acid propensity, asking you to identify which residue would most effectively destabilize a pre-existing $\\alpha$-helix. Successfully solving this problem demonstrates a core principle of protein folding: the primary sequence dictates the stability of the resulting secondary structure.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a short, eight-residue peptide with the sequence Ala-Glu-Val-Ala-Lys-Leu-Met-Ala. Experimental data from Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirms that this peptide readily adopts an $\\alpha$-helical conformation in an aqueous buffer at physiological pH. The researcher aims to engineer a variant of this peptide that is significantly less likely to form an $\\alpha$-helix. They decide to achieve this by introducing a single point mutation at the fourth position, replacing the original Alanine (Ala) residue.\n\nWhich of the following single amino acid substitutions at position 4 would be the most effective at disrupting the $\\alpha$-helical structure of the peptide?\n\nA. Proline (Pro)\n\nB. Glycine (Gly)\n\nC. Aspartic Acid (Asp)\n\nD. Tryptophan (Trp)\n\nE. Leucine (Leu)", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the single amino acid substitution at position 4 of the peptide `Ala-Glu-Val-Ala-Lys-Leu-Met-Ala` that would be most disruptive to its $\\alpha$-helical structure. The original amino acid at position 4 is Alanine (Ala), which has a high propensity to form $\\alpha$-helices. We must evaluate the properties of each potential substitute amino acid in the context of $\\alpha$-helix stability.\n\nAn $\\alpha$-helix is a stable secondary structure characterized by specific backbone dihedral angles (phi, $\\phi \\approx -57^\\circ$ and psi, $\\psi \\approx -47^\\circ$) and a regular hydrogen-bonding pattern where the carbonyl oxygen of residue $i$ forms a hydrogen bond with the amide hydrogen of residue $i+4$. Any substitution that interferes with these structural requirements will destabilize the helix.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. Proline (Pro)**\nProline is unique among the 20 common amino acids because its side chain is a five-membered ring that covalently bonds back to the backbone nitrogen atom. This has two major consequences for $\\alpha$-helices:\n1.  **Conformational Rigidity:** The ring structure restricts the possible values for the phi ($\\phi$) dihedral angle to approximately $-65^\\circ$. This value is outside the allowed range for a stable right-handed $\\alpha$-helix, introducing a severe kink in the backbone.\n2.  **Loss of Hydrogen Bond Donor:** The backbone nitrogen of proline is a secondary amine and lacks the hydrogen atom necessary to act as a hydrogen bond donor. Therefore, it cannot participate in the crucial $i \\to i+4$ hydrogen bonding pattern that stabilizes the helix.\nDue to these two factors, proline is known as a potent \"helix breaker\" and its presence in the middle of a helical segment is extremely disruptive.\n\n**B. Glycine (Gly)**\nGlycine has the simplest side chain, a single hydrogen atom. This lack of a bulky side chain gives glycine a very high degree of conformational flexibility. While it can technically adopt the phi/psi angles of an $\\alpha$-helix, it is not conformationally restricted to this state like other amino acids. There is a significant entropic cost to constraining the highly flexible glycine residue into the rigid helical conformation. Therefore, glycine tends to destabilize $\\alpha$-helices and is often found in flexible loops and turns. However, its disruptive effect is generally considered less severe than that of proline, which imposes a direct structural clash.\n\n**C. Aspartic Acid (Asp)**\nAspartic acid is a negatively charged amino acid at physiological pH. Replacing a small, non-polar residue like Alanine with a charged residue can be destabilizing, particularly if it is placed near other residues of like charge (though none are immediately adjacent here) or in a hydrophobic environment. However, aspartic acid itself does not have an intrinsic structural feature that prevents it from participating in an $\\alpha$-helix. Its helix propensity is lower than Alanine's but it is not considered a strong helix breaker.\n\n**D. Tryptophan (Trp)**\nTryptophan has a very large and bulky aromatic side chain. While extreme bulk can sometimes cause steric hindrance, Tryptophan is actually considered a moderate helix-former. Its bulk is not at the beta-carbon (unlike Val or Ile), so it does not sterically clash with the peptide backbone as severely. It can be readily accommodated within an $\\alpha$-helix.\n\n**E. Leucine (Leu)**\nLeucine is a hydrophobic amino acid with a branched aliphatic side chain. Along with Alanine and Methionine, Leucine is one of the strongest $\\alpha$-helix formers. Replacing one strong helix former (Ala) with another (Leu) would likely either maintain or even increase the stability of the $\\alpha$-helix, which is the opposite of the desired effect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the options, Proline is the most disruptive substituent. It introduces a direct structural incompatibility by forcing an incorrect backbone angle and breaks the essential hydrogen-bonding network. While Glycine is also destabilizing due to entropic effects, the structural constraints imposed by Proline make it the most powerful and reliable helix breaker. Therefore, substituting Alanine at position 4 with Proline would be the most effective strategy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2135532"}]}
