The protein collagen, a major component of connective tissue in animals, possesses a distinctive triple helix structure. This unique quaternary structure is stabilized by a characteristic, highly repetitive motif within its primary sequence.\n\nImagine a biochemist is studying a synthetic peptide segment intended to self-assemble into a collagen-like fibril. The primary sequence of this peptide segment is given as:\n\nGlycine(G)-Proline(P)-Histidine(H)-Glycine(G)-Alanine(A)-Proline(P)-Glycine(G)-Leucine(L)-Methionine(M)\n\nBased on this sequence, identify the most general and consistently repeating tripeptide (three-amino-acid) motif that is characteristic of collagen and is present throughout this entire segment.\n\nA.

Pro-X-Gly, where X represents any amino acid.\n\nE. Gly-X-Gly, where X represents any amino acid.", "solution": "The solution to this problem involves identifying the repeating amino acid pattern in the given sequence that is characteristic of collagen's structure.\n\nFirst, let's state the foundational principle of collagen structure. The stability of the collagen triple helix requires a specific repeating tripeptide motif, which is Gly-X-Y. In this motif, Glycine (G) must occupy every third position. The 'X' and 'Y' positions can be filled by any amino acid, but are frequently occupied by Proline (P) and Hydroxyproline (a modified version of Proline), respectively. The requirement for Glycine at every third position is absolute because Glycine is the only amino acid with a side chain small enough (a single hydrogen atom) to fit into the sterically crowded center of the tightly packed triple helix. Any other amino acid at this position would disrupt the helical structure.\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided peptide sequence:\nG-P-H-G-A-P-G-L-M\n\nWe can examine the sequence for a repeating pattern of three amino acids. Let's list the amino acids by their position number:\n1: G (Glycine)\n2: P (Proline)\n3: H (Histidine)\n4: G (Glycine)\n5: A (Alanine)\n6: P (Proline)\n7: G (Glycine)\n8: L (Leucine)\n9: M (Methionine)\n\nWe observe that Glycine (G) appears at positions 1, 4, and 7. This is a consistent pattern where Glycine appears at every third residue ($1, 1+3, 1+2 \\times 3$). This strongly suggests that the repeating unit is a triplet that begins with Glycine.\n\nLet's break the sequence into triplets based on this observation:\n- Triplet 1: Positions 1-3 form `G-P-H`\n- Triplet 2: Positions 4-6 form `G-A-P`\n- Triplet 3: Positions 7-9 form `G-L-M`\n\nNow we can evaluate the given options:\n\nA. **Gly-Pro-X**: The first triplet is `G-P-H`, which fits this pattern (X = H). However, the second triplet is `G-A-P`. Here, the amino acid in the second position is Alanine (A), not Proline (P). Therefore, the `Gly-Pro-X` motif is not consistently found throughout the sequence.\n\nB. **Gly-X-Y**: Let's check this against our parsed triplets.\n- Triplet 1: `G-P-H`. This fits the pattern with X = P and Y = H.\n- Triplet 2: `G-A-P`. This fits the pattern with X = A and Y = P.\n- Triplet 3: `G-L-M`. This fits the pattern with X = L and Y = M.\nThis motif is consistent for every triplet in the sequence.\n\nC. **X-Pro-Gly**: This motif requires Glycine (G) to be at the end of each triplet (positions 3, 6, 9, etc.). In our sequence, Glycine is at positions 1, 4, and 7. This option is incorrect.\n\nD. **Pro-X-Gly**: This motif requires the triplet to start with Proline (P) and end with Glycine (G). This is inconsistent with the observed sequence where triplets start with Glycine. This option is incorrect.\n\nE. **Gly-X-Gly**: This motif requires Glycine to be at the first and third positions of each triplet. \n- Triplet 1 is `G-P-H`. The third position is Histidine (H), not Glycine (G).\nTherefore, this motif is not present.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only motif that is consistently repeated throughout the entire peptide segment is Gly-X-Y, where X and Y can be any amino acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2098061"}, {"introduction": "A protein's final structure is not determined by its sequence alone; the surrounding chemical environment is equally crucial.

The PPII helix is a left-handed, extended conformation stabilized primarily by steric constraints and favorable solvation rather than by backbone hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions. For a long homopolypeptide, terminal group ionizations have negligible effect on the bulk conformation. Consequently, changing pH from $7.0$ to $2.0$ does not substantially alter the charge state of residues nor the forces stabilizing the PPII helix, so its stability remains largely unchanged.\n\nCombining these outcomes: poly-L-glutamate $\\alpha$-helix stability increases markedly with decreasing pH, while poly-L-proline PPII helix stability is largely unchanged.

A crucial component of this process is the Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment, which detects pairs of protons that are in close spatial proximity (typically less than 5 Ångstroms), regardless of their connectivity in the primary sequence. These observed proximities serve as geometric constraints for calculating the protein's fold.\n\nFor a polypeptide chain, distinct patterns of short-range NOE connectivities involving backbone protons act as fingerprints for different types of secondary structure. We will use the notation $d_{XY}(i, j)$ to represent an observed NOE cross-peak between a proton of type $X$ on amino acid residue $i$ and a proton of type $Y$ on amino acid residue $j$. For the backbone, $X$ and $Y$ can be 'N' for the amide proton (H$^\\text{N}$) or '$\\alpha$' for the alpha-proton (H$^\\alpha$).

Therefore, a “strong” NOE implies a systematically short interproton distance, and recurring strong sequential NOEs over a run of residues signal a stable, repeating geometry such as a regular secondary structure.\n\nKnown NMR fingerprints for helices arise from their characteristic helical geometry (residues per turn and hydrogen-bond pattern). For an $\\alpha$-helix, the hydrogen bond is $i \\rightarrow i+4$ and there are about $3.6$ residues per turn. Empirically and canonically, this yields strong sequential $d_{NN}(i,i+1)$ and strong $d_{\\alpha N}(i,i+3)$ NOEs, because $H^{N}(i)$ and $H^{N}(i+1)$ are close along the helix axis and $H^{\\alpha}(i)$ is brought near $H^{N}(i+3)$ by the helical rotation and radius. This pattern is explicitly given in the prompt as the $\\alpha$-helix signature, which directly identifies option B as the $\\alpha$-helix and thus not diagnostic of a $3_{10}$ helix.\n\nFor a $3_{10}$ helix, the hydrogen bond is $i \\rightarrow i+3$ and there are $3$ residues per turn. This tighter turn shifts the closest recurring $H^{\\alpha}(i)$ to $H^{N}(i+m)$ contact from $m=3$ (as in an $\\alpha$-helix) to $m=2$, producing strong $d_{\\alpha N}(i,i+2)$ NOEs rather than $d_{\\alpha N}(i,i+3)$. As in all helices, contiguous backbone amides remain axially close, maintaining strong $d_{NN}(i,i+1)$ NOEs. Therefore, the most unambiguous sequential pattern for a $3_{10}$ helix is the combination of strong $d_{NN}(i,i+1)$ with strong $d_{\\alpha N}(i,i+2)$ across a run of residues.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- A: Strong sequential $d_{\\alpha N}(i,i+1)$ NOEs are characteristic of extended (beta-strand) conformations where $H^{\\alpha}(i)$ lies near $H^{N}(i+1)$; this is not a $3_{10}$-helix fingerprint.\n- B: Strong $d_{NN}(i,i+1)$ and $d_{\\alpha N}(i,i+3)$ NOEs identify an $\\alpha$-helix, not a $3_{10}$ helix.\n- C: Strong $d_{NN}(i,i+1)$ and $d_{\\alpha N}(i,i+2)$ NOEs match the expected $3_{10}$-helix fingerprint derived above.\n- D: Strong $d_{\\alpha N}(i,i+4)$ NOEs would suggest a helix with a larger residues-per-turn value (e.g., a $\\pi$-helix), not a $3_{10}$ helix.\n- E: Strong $d_{\\alpha\\alpha}(i,i+1)$ NOEs are not a specific helical signature and can occur in various contexts; they are not the diagnostic pattern for a $3_{10}$ helix.\n\nTherefore, the most unambiguous signature for a $3_{10}$-helical conformation among the given choices is the pattern in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2098039"}]}
