This first practice focuses on the fundamental question: what makes a particular sequence of amino acids likely to form a β-strand? By analyzing short peptide sequences [@problem_id:2113850], you will learn to apply the principles of amino acid propensity, where factors like side-chain size, branching, and charge influence the backbone's preference for an extended conformation. Mastering this skill is the first step toward predicting protein structure from its primary sequence.", "problem": "In protein structural biology, the secondary structure of a polypeptide chain, such as an α-helix or a β-strand, is largely determined by the intrinsic propensities of its constituent amino acid residues. A β-strand is characterized by a relatively extended backbone conformation. The side chains of adjacent residues in a β-strand point in opposite directions from the plane of the sheet. Certain amino acid side chains, due to their size, shape, or charge, are more favorable for this extended conformation than others.\n\nConsider the following five short peptide sequences, presented with their three-letter and one-letter codes. Assuming each peptide is in a solution at a physiological pH of approximately 7.4, which sequence is most likely to adopt a stable β-strand conformation?\n\nA.

Phe-Trp-Pro-Val-His-Trp-Phe (F-W-P-V-H-W-F)", "solution": "We aim to identify which sequence has the highest intrinsic propensity to adopt a stable beta-strand conformation at physiological pH.\n\nPrinciples used:\n1) Residue propensities: Beta-strands are favored by beta-branched aliphatic residues (Val, Ile, Thr) and aromatics (Tyr, Trp, Phe). Helix-favoring residues (Ala, Leu) are less favorable for strands. Gly destabilizes due to high conformational entropy, and Pro disrupts due to its rigid ring and lack of a backbone amide hydrogen, which prevents donating an interstrand hydrogen bond.\n2) Alternating side-chain pattern: In a beta-strand, adjacent side chains alternate to opposite faces. Sequences with an alternating pattern of hydrophobic and polar residues stabilize beta-sheets by allowing one face to be hydrophobic and the other polar/charged.\n3) Electrostatics at physiological pH: At approximately neutral pH, Asp and Glu are negatively charged, Lys is positively charged, and His is near its pKa and partially protonated. High local charge density or repeating like charges destabilize strands due to electrostatic repulsion and solvent exposure if not counterbalanced.\n\nNow evaluate each option:\n\nA. Ala-Leu-Glu-Ala-Lys-Ala-Leu\n- Composition: Multiple Ala and Leu, both helix-favoring; includes charged Glu and Lys but without a clear alternating pattern.\n- Pattern: Nonpolar-nonpolar-negative-nonpolar-positive-nonpolar-nonpolar; lacks strong hydrophobic/polar alternation.\n- Conclusion: Weaker beta-strand propensity due to helix bias and irregular polarity pattern.\n\nB. Val-Thr-Ile-Tyr-Val-Thr-Ile\n- Composition: Val and Ile are classic beta-strand formers (beta-branched). Thr and Tyr are compatible with strands; Tyr is aromatic with polar character; Thr is polar and often strand-favoring.\n- Pattern: Hydrophobic (Val) – polar (Thr) – hydrophobic (Ile) – polar/aromatic (Tyr) – hydrophobic (Val) – polar (Thr) – hydrophobic (Ile). This is a strong hydrophobic/polar alternation, ideal for a beta-strand with one hydrophobic face and one polar face.\n- Conclusion: Strong beta-strand propensity by both residue types and alternation.\n\nC. Asp-Glu-Asp-Asp-Glu-Asp-Glu\n- Composition: Almost entirely negatively charged residues at physiological pH, leading to strong like-charge repulsion.\n- Pattern: Highly charged, no hydrophobic/polar alternation, very unfavorable for forming a stable strand unless extensively compensated, which is not implied here.\n- Conclusion: Poor beta-strand propensity due to charge clustering and electrostatics.\n\nD. Gly-Pro-Ser-Gly-Asn-Gly-Asp\n- Composition: Multiple Gly and a Pro. Gly destabilizes extended conformations due to high flexibility; Pro disrupts strand hydrogen bonding by lacking the backbone amide hydrogen and restricting backbone angles.\n- Pattern: No strong hydrophobic/polar alternation and contains known strand breakers.\n- Conclusion: Unfavorable for a stable beta-strand.\n\nE. Phe-Trp-Pro-Val-His-Trp-Phe\n- Composition: Phe and Trp can favor beta-strands; however, Pro in the middle disrupts strand hydrogen bonding.\n- Pattern: No clear hydrophobic/polar alternation; presence of Pro significantly reduces strand stability.\n- Conclusion: Less favorable than an optimal strand-forming sequence.\n\nBy comparing all sequences against the principles above, sequence B exhibits both optimal residue types and an ideal alternating pattern, making it the most likely to adopt a stable beta-strand conformation at physiological pH.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2113850"}, {"introduction": "Once individual β-strands form, they assemble into β-sheets through a precise network of backbone hydrogen bonds. The relative orientation of these strands—either parallel or antiparallel—gives rise to unique geometric and hydrogen-bonding \"fingerprints.\" This exercise [@problem_id:2113875] challenges you to act as a structural detective, deducing the orientation of strands within a mixed sheet by interpreting descriptions of their hydrogen-bonding patterns.

The association is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the backbone carbonyl oxygen and amide hydrogen atoms of the adjacent strands.\n\nA biochemist is studying a newly isolated protein and has identified a three-stranded β-sheet. The strands are adjacent to each other in the order S1, S2, S3. Through a detailed structural analysis, the following hydrogen-bonding patterns have been elucidated:\n\n1.  For the interaction between strand S1 and strand S2, the backbone atoms of a single amino acid residue on S1 form hydrogen bonds exclusively with the backbone atoms of a single amino acid residue on S2. This pattern is repeated along the length of the interacting strands.\n2.  For the interaction between strand S2 and strand S3, the backbone atoms of a single amino acid residue on S2 are observed to form hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms of two different, non-adjacent amino acid residues on S3.\n\nBased on these characteristic hydrogen-bonding patterns, determine the relative orientation of the strands within this mixed β-sheet.\n\nA.

S1 is antiparallel to S2; S2 is parallel to S3.\n\nE. The described hydrogen-bonding patterns are not physically possible for a β-sheet.", "solution": "We use the characteristic hydrogen-bonding registries of beta-sheets:\n- In an antiparallel beta-sheet, a single residue $i$ on one strand forms its two backbone hydrogen bonds (its $N\\!-\\!H$ donor and its $C\\!=\\!O$ acceptor) with the corresponding two backbone groups of a single residue $j$ on the opposing strand. Symbolically, $i$ on one strand pairs $1{:}1$ with $j$ on the other: both $N\\!-\\!H_{i}\\to O_{j}$ and $O_{i}\\leftarrow N\\!-\\!H_{j}$ occur between the same residue pair. This yields an exclusive, residue-to-residue pattern repeated along the sheet.\n- In a parallel beta-sheet, a single residue $i$ on one strand cannot make both its backbone hydrogen bonds to the same residue on the opposing strand because the strands run in the same direction and the donor and acceptor groups are offset. Instead, $i$ donates and accepts hydrogen bonds to two different residues on the opposing strand, e.g., $N\\!-\\!H_{i}\\to O_{j}$ and $O_{i}\\leftarrow N\\!-\\!H_{j+k}$ with $k\\neq 0$, so the partners are different and typically non-adjacent along sequence. Thus each residue on one strand bonds to two different residues on the opposing strand.\n\nMapping the given observations:\n1. S1–S2 shows an exclusive $1{:}1$ residue pairing repeated along the length. This matches the antiparallel hallmark, so S1 is antiparallel to S2.\n2. S2–S3 shows that a single residue on S2 hydrogen-bonds to two different, non-adjacent residues on S3. This matches the parallel hallmark, so S2 is parallel to S3.\n\nTherefore, the mixed beta-sheet has S1 antiparallel to S2, and S2 parallel to S3, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2113875"}, {"introduction": "While we often study idealized protein structures, real proteins are dynamic and must often accommodate imperfections such as mutations. This advanced problem explores the concept of structural plasticity within a β-sheet. Presented with a hypothetical deletion in a central strand [@problem_id:2113901], you will use the rules of β-sheet geometry to predict how the structure adapts to maintain stability. This exercise introduces the β-bulge, a common structural motif, and sharpens your ability to reason about how proteins solve complex topological puzzles to preserve their fold and function.", "problem": "Consider a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, a common structural motif in proteins. The strands are labeled S1, S2, and S3, with S2 being the central strand. The residues in each strand are numbered sequentially: S1 consists of residues 1 to 10, S2 consists of residues 21 to 30, and S3 consists of residues 41 to 50. In this idealized sheet, a residue on the central strand S2 forms hydrogen bonds with exactly one residue on S1 and one residue on S3. For example, residue 25 on strand S2 is hydrogen-bonded to residue 6 on strand S1 and to residue 46 on strand S3. Similarly, residue 23 on S2 is hydrogen-bonded to residue 8 on S1 and residue 48 on S3.\n\nNow, imagine a single-residue deletion mutation occurs, removing residue 25 from the central strand S2. The protein structure adapts to this deletion by locally rearranging the hydrogen bonding network to maximize thermodynamic stability. This adaptation results in the formation of a complex β-bulge, which allows for a new, direct hydrogen bond to form between the outer strands, S1 and S3, thereby bridging the gap left by the deleted residue.\n\nBased on the principles of β-sheet geometry and the drive to satisfy hydrogen bonding potential, which of the following options represents the most plausible new hydrogen bond that forms as a direct consequence of this deletion?\n\nA. Residue 7 on S1 pairs with residue 47 on S3.\n\nB. Residue 6 on S1 pairs with residue 45 on S3.\n\nC. Residue 6 on S1 pairs with residue 46 on S3.\n\nD. Residue 24 on S2 pairs with residue 26 on S2.\n\nE. No new hydrogen bond forms; residues S1(6) and S3(46) remain unpaired.", "solution": "We begin by formalizing the hydrogen bonding register implied by the given examples for an antiparallel $\\beta$-sheet. Let $j$ denote a residue index on the central strand S2, and let $i_{1}$ and $i_{3}$ denote the indices of the residues on S1 and S3 that hydrogen bond to S2 residue $j$, respectively. From the examples:\n- S2 residue $j=25$ pairs with S1 residue $i_{1}=6$ and S3 residue $i_{3}=46$,\n- S2 residue $j=23$ pairs with S1 residue $i_{1}=8$ and S3 residue $i_{3}=48$.\nIn an antiparallel $\\beta$-sheet, the hydrogen bonds maintain a constant sum of indices along each pair of strands. Solving for the register constants using the two examples gives:\n$$i_{1}+j=31 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad i_{1}=31-j,$$\n$$i_{3}+j=71 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad i_{3}=71-j.$$\nThus, in the ideal sheet, each S2 residue $j$ pairs with S1 residue $31-j$ and S3 residue $71-j$. In particular,\n- $j=24$ pairs with S1(7) and S3(47),\n- $j=25$ pairs with S1(6) and S3(46),\n- $j=26$ pairs with S1(5) and S3(45).\n\nNow consider the deletion of residue $j=25$ on S2. This deletion removes the partners for S1(6) and S3(46), leaving those two residues unpaired in the local network. To maximize hydrogen bond satisfaction and minimize global disruption, a local $\\beta$-bulge can form that inserts a direct interstrand hydrogen bond between the two outer strands across the missing central partner. The most favorable new bond is therefore between the two residues that lost their partners due to the deletion, namely S1(6) and S3(46), because:\n- it bridges exactly the rung corresponding to the deleted S2 residue,\n- it preserves the existing register on the adjacent rungs (e.g., $j=24$ still pairs S1(7) and S3(47); $j=26$ still pairs S1(5) and S3(45)),\n- it maximizes hydrogen bonding with the least perturbation.\n\nBy contrast:\n- Option A (S1(7) with S3(47)) would co-opt residues that remain appropriately paired with S2(24), unnecessarily disrupting an intact rung.\n- Option B (S1(6) with S3(45)) would disrupt two rungs by involving S3(45), which is paired with S2(26).\n- Option D proposes an intrastrand hydrogen bond within S2 between adjacent residues, which is not characteristic of $\\beta$-sheet backbone hydrogen bonding.\n- Option E contradicts the stated adaptation via a $\\beta$-bulge and the general drive to satisfy backbone hydrogen bonding.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible new hydrogen bond is S1(6) with S3(46).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2113901"}]}
