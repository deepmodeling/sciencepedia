The conformation of the turn is largely determined by the Ramachandran dihedral angles ($\\phi, \\psi$) of the two central residues, $i+1$ and $i+2$.\n\nTwo of the most common types of β-turns are Type I and Type II. They are distinguished by the angles of the central residues:\n- **Type I turn**: The residue at position $i+1$ has typical dihedral angles of ($\\phi_{i+1}, \\psi_{i+1}$) $\\approx$ ($-60^\\circ, -30^\\circ$).\n- **Type II turn**: The residue at position $i+1$ has typical dihedral angles of ($\\phi_{i+1}, \\psi_{i+1}$) $\\approx$ ($-60^\\circ, +120^\\circ$).\n\nProline is a unique amino acid because its side chain is covalently bonded to its own backbone amide nitrogen, forming a five-membered ring.

As an imino acid, proline lacks the amide proton necessary to form a hydrogen bond, and this bond is a critical stabilizing interaction for the residue at the $i+1$ position in a Type II turn.\n\nD. A Type II turn requires a small, flexible residue like glycine at the $i+1$ position to accommodate the unusual backbone angles, making the bulky proline residue sterically unfavorable.\n\nE.

Hence statement A, which claims incompatibility with $\\phi_{i+1} \\approx -60^{\\circ}$ in Type II, is incorrect.\n\n2. The hydrogen bond that stabilizes the turn is between residue $i$ and residue $i+3$. The residue at $i+1$ does not donate this hydrogen bond; thus the absence of an amide proton on proline at $i+1$ is irrelevant to this key interaction. Therefore statement C is incorrect.\n\n3. In Type II turns, the second central residue often adopts $(\\phi_{i+2}, \\psi_{i+2}) \\approx (80^{\\circ}, 0^{\\circ})$, which favors glycine at $i+2$ (or, in some conventions, at the adjacent position) due to the steric difficulty L-amino acids have with positive $\\phi$.

Hence statements D (which incorrectly assigns glycine necessity to $i+1$) and E (which incorrectly ties $\\psi_{i+1} > 0$ to the identity of residue $i+2$) are incorrect.\n\n4. The specific stereochemical reason proline is disfavored at $i+1$ in Type II turns arises from steric clash.
