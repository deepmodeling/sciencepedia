This first exercise challenges you to apply your knowledge of amino acid properties to design a peptide that forms an amphipathic β-strand, where one face is hydrophobic and the other is hydrophilic. Mastering this task requires understanding the fundamental principle of alternating side-chain orientation which is characteristic of the β-strand conformation. [@problem_id:2147650]", "problem": "In protein structural biology, a β-strand is a stretch of polypeptide chain typically 3 to 10 amino acids long with a backbone in an extended conformation. An amphipathic β-strand is one that has a distinct separation of character on its two faces: one face presents primarily hydrophobic side chains to the protein's core, while the opposite face presents primarily hydrophilic side chains to the aqueous solvent.\n\nConsidering the following simplified classification of amino acids:\n- **Hydrophobic (Nonpolar):** Leucine (L), Valine (V), Isoleucine (I), Phenylalanine (F), Alanine (A)\n- **Hydrophilic (Polar/Charged):** Lysine (K), Arginine (R), Glutamic Acid (E), Aspartic Acid (D), Serine (S)\n- **Structure-Disrupting:** Proline (P)\n\nWhich one of the following 7-residue peptide sequences, written from N-terminus to C-terminus, is most likely to form a stable, amphipathic β-strand?\n\nA.

Lys-Leu-Leu-Glu-Arg-Phe-Ile", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify which 7-residue peptide sequence is most likely to form a stable, amphipathic β-strand. To solve this, we must consider the specific geometry of a β-strand and the chemical properties of the given amino acids.\n\nFirst, let's recall the fundamental structural property of a β-strand. The peptide backbone is in an extended, pleated conformation. A key consequence of this structure is that the side chains (R-groups) of adjacent amino acid residues point in opposite directions relative to the plane of the β-sheet. That is, the side chain of residue `i` points \"up,\" the side chain of residue `i+1` points \"down,\" the side chain of residue `i+2` points \"up\" again, and so on.\n\nFor a β-strand to be amphipathic, one face must be hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic. Based on the alternating side-chain arrangement, this means that the amino acids at positions `i`, `i+2`, `i+4`, etc., must share a similar chemical property (e.g., all hydrophobic) because their side chains all point in the same direction. Likewise, the amino acids at positions `i+1`, `i+3`, `i+5`, etc., must share the opposite chemical property (e.g., all hydrophilic) as their side chains all point in the opposite direction.\n\nTherefore, the defining characteristic of an amphipathic β-strand is an alternating pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues along the primary sequence. We will now analyze each of the given options based on this principle, using the provided classification:\n- **H:** Hydrophobic (L, V, I, F, A)\n- **P:** Hydrophilic (K, R, E, D, S)\n- **X:** Structure-Disrupting (P)\n\n**Option A: Leu-Lys-Val-Glu-Ile-Arg-Phe**\nLet's map the properties of the residues in this sequence.\n- Position 1: Leu (H)\n- Position 2: Lys (P)\n- Position 3: Val (H)\n- Position 4: Glu (P)\n- Position 5: Ile (H)\n- Position 6: Arg (P)\n- Position 7: Phe (H)\nThe pattern is H-P-H-P-H-P-H. This is a perfect alternating pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. The side chains at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 (Leu, Val, Ile, Phe) are all hydrophobic and would form one face of the strand. The side chains at positions 2, 4, and 6 (Lys, Glu, Arg) are all hydrophilic and would form the opposite face. This sequence is an excellent candidate for an amphipathic β-strand.\n\n**Option B: Leu-Val-Ile-Lys-Glu-Arg-Phe**\nLet's map the properties.\n- Pattern: H-H-H-P-P-P-H\nThis sequence groups the hydrophobic residues together and the hydrophilic residues together. In a β-strand conformation, this would not result in two distinct faces. For example, the side chains at positions 1 (Leu, H) and 3 (Ile, H) would be on the same face, but the side chain at position 2 (Val, H) would be on the opposite face, mixing the properties. This sequence is not amphipathic.\n\n**Option C: Leu-Lys-Val-Pro-Ile-Arg-Phe**\nLet's map the properties.\n- Pattern: H-P-H-X-H-P-H\nThis sequence contains Proline (P) at position 4. Proline's side chain forms a rigid ring that connects back to the amide nitrogen of the peptide backbone. This cyclic structure restricts the backbone dihedral angle phi ($\\phi$) to a narrow range (around -60 degrees), which is incompatible with the extended conformation required for a β-strand (typically $\\phi \\approx -120$ to $-140$ degrees). Therefore, the presence of Proline will disrupt or \"break\" the β-strand structure, making it unstable. Regardless of the hydrophobicity pattern, this sequence is unlikely to form a stable β-strand.\n\n**Option D: Leu-Val-Leu-Ile-Leu-Phe-Val**\nLet's map the properties.\n- Pattern: H-H-H-H-H-H-H\nAll residues in this sequence are hydrophobic. This sequence would form a stable β-strand, but it would be entirely hydrophobic on both faces, not amphipathic. It would likely be found buried completely within the core of a protein.\n\n**Option E: Lys-Leu-Leu-Glu-Arg-Phe-Ile**\nLet's map the properties.\n- Pattern: P-H-H-P-P-H-H\nThis sequence has no clear alternating pattern. For example, residues at positions 2 (Leu, H) and 3 (Leu, H) are adjacent and both hydrophobic. Residues on the same face, like at positions 1 (Lys, P) and 3 (Leu, H), have different properties. This strand would have a mixed, non-amphipathic character.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing all the options, we find that only sequence A exhibits the strict alternating pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues required to form an amphipathic β-strand. Furthermore, it does not contain any structure-disrupting residues like Proline. Therefore, it is the most likely sequence to form the desired structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2147650"}, {"introduction": "Individual β-strands rarely exist in isolation; they assemble into larger β-sheets with specific topologies.

For a β-sheet, these diagrams follow a set of conventions:\n1. Each β-strand is represented by an arrow, with the arrowhead pointing from the N-terminus towards the C-terminus.\n2. The arrows are placed side-by-side to reflect their spatial arrangement in the folded protein.\n3. Hydrogen bonds determine the relative orientation: adjacent antiparallel strands are shown with arrows pointing in opposite directions, while adjacent parallel strands have arrows pointing in the same direction.\n4. Lines or curves represent the polypeptide loops connecting the C-terminus of one strand to the N-terminus of the next strand in the primary sequence.\n\nConsider a mixed β-sheet composed of four strands, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the final three-dimensional structure, the strands are arranged spatially in the sequential order 1-2-3-4. The polypeptide chain connects the strands sequentially, meaning the C-terminus of strand 1 is connected to the N-terminus of strand 2, the C-terminus of strand 2 to the N-terminus of strand 3, and the C-terminus of strand 3 to the N-terminus of strand 4.\n\nThe hydrogen-bonding pattern is as follows:\n- Strand 1 is antiparallel to strand 2.\n- Strand 2 is parallel to strand 3.\n- Strand 3 is antiparallel to strand 4.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the topology diagram for this β-sheet?\n\nA.

The directions are up, down, down, and up, respectively. The connections between all adjacent strands (1-2, 2-3, and 3-4) are represented by short hairpin loops.\n\nC. The diagram shows four arrows in the spatial order 1-2-3-4. The directions are up, down, down, and up, respectively.

The diagram shows the arrows for strands 1 and 3 pointing up, and the arrows for strands 2 and 4 pointing down. The spatial arrangement of the strands in the diagram is 1-3-2-4, and all connections are short loops.", "solution": "We use the conventions of β-sheet topology diagrams: (i) arrows represent β-strands with arrowheads pointing from N-terminus to C-terminus; (ii) adjacent antiparallel strands are drawn with opposite arrow directions, and adjacent parallel strands with the same direction; (iii) sequential connections between strands in the primary sequence are drawn as loops, where antiparallel sequential neighbors can form short hairpin loops, while parallel sequential neighbors typically require longer crossover loops.\n\nGiven the spatial order of strands is 1-2-3-4 and the chain connects sequentially 1 to 2 to 3 to 4, we impose the hydrogen-bonding constraints: strand 1 is antiparallel to 2, strand 2 is parallel to 3, and strand 3 is antiparallel to 4. Assign an arbitrary direction to strand 1, for instance “up.” Because 1 is antiparallel to 2, strand 2 must be “down.” Because 2 is parallel to 3, strand 3 must also be “down.” Because 3 is antiparallel to 4, strand 4 must be “up.” Therefore, the arrow directions in spatial order 1-2-3-4 are up, down, down, up.\n\nNext, analyze the loop types for the sequential connections. The 1-2 connection links antiparallel adjacent strands, which is compatible with a short hairpin loop between the C-terminus of 1 and the N-terminus of 2. The 2-3 connection links parallel adjacent strands; in such a case, a short hairpin is not geometrically feasible for a direct connection because the C-terminus of 2 and the N-terminus of 3 lie on opposite edges relative to the sheet direction, so the polypeptide typically executes a longer crossover loop (often a β-α-β connection). The 3-4 connection again links antiparallel adjacent strands, which supports a short hairpin loop.\n\nComparing with the options: A is incorrect because it imposes alternating directions, contradicting the required parallel relationship between 2 and 3. B is incorrect because it assigns only short hairpins, contradicting the need for a long crossover in the parallel 2-3 connection. C matches both the directions (up, down, down, up) and the loop types (short for 1-2 and 3-4; long crossover for 2-3). D is incorrect because it forces all strands to be parallel, contradicting the given antiparallel relationships.

[@problem_id:2147655]", "problem": "In protein architecture, antiparallel β-sheets are secondary structures formed by two or more polypeptide chains (β-strands) running in opposite N-terminus to C-terminus directions. These strands are linked by short loops or tight turns, known as β-turns. A common type of β-turn requires a specific sequence of four amino acid residues to execute a sharp 180-degree reversal of the polypeptide chain. The conformational angles required for this tight turn are sterically demanding. Glycine, with its single hydrogen atom as a side chain, is frequently found in these turns because its small size and conformational flexibility allow it to adopt angles that are forbidden for most other amino acids. In contrast, Tryptophan has the largest side chain among the standard amino acids, featuring a bulky indole group.\n\nConsider a stable, naturally occurring protein that contains a critical antiparallel β-sheet.

The β-sheet will become more stable due to new hydrophobic interactions introduced by the tryptophan side chain.\n\nB. The mutation will have no significant effect on the β-sheet's structure, as the change involves only a single amino acid.\n\nC.

Such a turn imposes stringent dihedral angle constraints on the residues, especially at a key position often requiring conformations with $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ values that are disallowed for most residues.\n\nState the principle of residue suitability: Glycine, having only a hydrogen as a side chain, has minimal steric hindrance and an unusually broad allowed region on the Ramachandran plot, enabling it to adopt the sterically demanding $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ angles required in tight β-turns (notably Type I and Type II, particularly at the $i+2$ position). In contrast, tryptophan has the bulkiest side chain (indole group), severely restricting its accessible conformational space and making such tight dihedral angles energetically unfavorable due to steric clashes.\n\nInfer the effect of the mutation: Replacing the critical glycine with tryptophan at the key turn position will introduce steric hindrance that prevents the residue from adopting the necessary $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ angles. This will hinder or prevent formation of the tight β-turn, thereby misaligning the strands and disrupting the interstrand hydrogen-bonding pattern required for a stable antiparallel β-sheet.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because adding a bulky hydrophobic side chain at a sterically constrained turn does not stabilize the sheet; instead, it disrupts the turn and the sheet’s registry.\n- B is incorrect because single-residue substitutions at structurally critical positions (tight turns) can have large effects.\n- C is correct because steric hindrance from tryptophan will likely prevent the tight β-turn, thereby impeding proper sheet formation.\n- D is incorrect because loss of a tight turn will not spontaneously reconfigure the architecture into a parallel β-sheet; such a rearrangement requires a different topology.\n- E is incorrect because tryptophan reduces, not increases, conformational flexibility in tight turns.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is disruption of the tight turn, preventing correct antiparallel β-sheet formation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2147655"}]}
