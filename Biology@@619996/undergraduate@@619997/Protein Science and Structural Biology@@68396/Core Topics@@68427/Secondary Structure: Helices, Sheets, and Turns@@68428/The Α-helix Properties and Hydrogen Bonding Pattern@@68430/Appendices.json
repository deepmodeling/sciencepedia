It is a right-handed coiled conformation stabilized by a specific and repeating pattern of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. In an ideal α-helix, a hydrogen bond forms between the electronegative carbonyl oxygen atom of one amino acid residue and the electropositive amide hydrogen atom of a different residue located further along the polypeptide sequence.\n\nConsider a segment of a polypeptide that forms a long, ideal α-helix. The amino acid residues are numbered sequentially starting from the N-terminus. If the carbonyl oxygen of the amino acid at position 25 is observed to participate in such a stabilizing hydrogen bond, identify the residue number of the amino acid that provides the corresponding amide hydrogen for this bond.", "solution": "In an ideal alpha-helix, the stabilizing hydrogen bond pattern is such that the carbonyl oxygen of residue $i$ accepts a hydrogen bond from the amide hydrogen of residue $i+4$. Symbolically, if the carbonyl oxygen is at residue $i$, then the donor residue index $j$ satisfies\n$$\nj=i+4.\n$$\nHere, the carbonyl oxygen is from residue $i=25$.
