This first exercise provides a direct way to connect the one-dimensional information of a polypeptide sequence to its three-dimensional length when folded into a canonical $\\alpha$-helix. By understanding the consistent 'rise per residue', we can calculate the overall length of a helix, a crucial parameter for understanding how proteins span membranes or bridge domains [@problem_id:2112704].", "problem": "A crucial transmembrane domain of a particular ion channel protein consists of a single polypeptide segment that is 40 amino acid residues long. Biophysical measurements indicate that this entire segment adopts a stable, canonical alpha-helical conformation to span the lipid bilayer. For a canonical alpha-helix, the translation along the helical axis (rise) is 1.5 Å per residue. Calculate the total length of this helical segment, which corresponds to the thickness of the membrane it traverses. Express your final answer in nanometers (nm) and round it to two significant figures. Note that 1 nanometer (nm) is equal to 10 angstroms (Å).", "solution": "The problem asks for the total length of a polypeptide segment that is folded into a canonical alpha-helix. The length of an ideal helix is determined by the number of repeating units (amino acid residues in this case) and the translation along the helical axis for each unit (the rise per residue).\n\nLet $N$ be the number of amino acid residues in the polypeptide segment, and let $d$ be the rise per residue for an alpha-helix. The total length, $L$, of the helix can be calculated using the following relation:\n$$L = N \\times d$$\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The number of residues, $N = 40$.\n- The rise per residue, $d = 1.5$ Å.\n\nFirst, we calculate the length of the helix in angstroms (Å) by substituting the given values into the formula:\n$$L = 40 \\times 1.5 \\text{ Å} = 60 \\text{ Å}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in nanometers (nm). We are given the conversion factor:\n$$1 \\text{ nm} = 10 \\text{ Å}$$\nTo convert the length from angstroms to nanometers, we divide the value in angstroms by 10:\n$$L_{\\text{nm}} = \\frac{60 \\text{ Å}}{10 \\text{ Å/nm}} = 6.0 \\text{ nm}$$\nFinally, the problem specifies that the answer should be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value of 6.0 nm has two significant figures (the '6' and the '0' after the decimal point). Therefore, no further rounding is needed.

The hallmark of the $\\alpha$-helix is a precise and repeating pattern of intramolecular hydrogen bonds that lock the polypeptide backbone into its coiled conformation. This practice focuses on quantifying this stability by calculating the total number of these crucial hydrogen bonds based on a simple but powerful rule governing their formation [@problem_id:2112691].", "problem": "In a structural biology lab, a researcher synthesizes a short peptide designed to adopt a specific secondary structure. The peptide consists of 20 amino acid residues. Biophysical measurements confirm that the entire peptide folds into a single, continuous, and perfectly formed $\\alpha$-helix under experimental conditions.\n\nAn $\\alpha$-helix is stabilized by a specific pattern of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Within a standard right-handed $\\alpha$-helix, a backbone hydrogen bond forms between the carbonyl oxygen atom (C=O) of an amino acid residue, denoted as residue $i$, and the amide hydrogen atom (N-H) of the amino acid residue at position $i+4$.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of intramolecular backbone hydrogen bonds that stabilize this 20-residue helical peptide.", "solution": "An ideal right-handed $\\alpha$-helix exhibits a backbone hydrogen bond pattern where the carbonyl oxygen of residue $i$ accepts a hydrogen bond from the amide hydrogen of residue $i+4$. For a peptide of length $n$, such hydrogen bonds can only form when both residues $i$ and $i+4$ exist within the chain. This imposes the constraint that $i$ must satisfy $1 \\leq i \\leq n-4$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct intramolecular backbone hydrogen bonds is the number of integers in the inclusive range $[1, n-4]$, which equals $n-4$.\n\nFor the given peptide with $n=20$ residues, the total number of hydrogen bonds is\n$$\n20 - 4 = 16.\n$$\nEach such bond is unique and corresponds to the $(i, i+4)$ pair for $i=1,2,\\ldots,16$, stabilizing the single continuous $\\alpha$-helix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "2112691"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of helical geometry and stability, we can now use these principles in a predictive capacity. The helical wheel is a powerful conceptual tool that allows us to visualize the distribution of side chains along the helix, revealing functional faces such as those in amphipathic helices. This exercise presents a hypothetical scenario involving a mutation, challenging you to use the principles of the helical wheel to predict the functional consequences and demonstrate how structure directly dictates biological activity [@problem_id:2112646].", "problem": "A hypothetical 18-residue peptide, named Membindin-18, is found to form a stable, amphipathic alpha-helix that is crucial for its function of partially inserting into a cell membrane. For the purpose of analysis, this peptide can be modeled as an ideal alpha-helix, where each consecutive amino acid residue is rotated by 100 degrees around the helical axis relative to its predecessor.\n\nStructural analysis of the wild-type Membindin-18 reveals that its hydrophobic amino acids (Leucine and Isoleucine) are specifically located at positions 1, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 15, and 16 along the peptide chain. The remaining positions are occupied by hydrophilic amino acids (such as Lysine and Aspartate).\n\nTo investigate the role of a specific residue, a genetic engineer creates a mutant version of the peptide by replacing the Isoleucine at position 8 with a Glutamic acid residue (an I8E mutation). At physiological pH, Glutamic acid is hydrophilic and carries a negative charge.\n\nBased on a helical wheel projection and the principles of protein structure, predict the most direct and immediate consequence of the I8E mutation on the properties of Membindin-18.\n\nA. The mutation will enhance the amphipathic character of the helix, leading to stronger membrane binding.\n\nB. The mutation will disrupt the amphipathic character of the helix by introducing a hydrophilic residue onto the hydrophobic face.\n\nC. The mutation will have no significant effect on the peptide's amphipathicity, as position 8 lies on the boundary between the polar and nonpolar faces.\n\nD. The mutation will invert the amphipathicity of the helix, causing the face that was previously polar to become nonpolar.\n\nE. The mutation will cause the entire peptide to lose its helical structure and adopt a random coil conformation.", "solution": "The ideal alpha-helix model specifies that successive residues are rotated by 100 degrees around the helical axis. This implies there are $360/100=3.6$ residues per turn, and residues separated by $3$ to $4$ positions lie on approximately the same face of the helix. Let the angular position (in degrees) of residue $k$ relative to residue $1$ be $\\theta_{k}=((k-1)\\times 100) \\bmod 360$.\n\nSet $\\theta_{1}=0^\\circ$ by convention.

In particular, residue $8$ at $\\theta_{8}=340^\\circ$ lies well within this hydrophobic face.\n\nNow consider the I8E mutation. Isoleucine at position $8$ is hydrophobic and contributes to the hydrophobic face. Replacing it with glutamate at physiological pH introduces a negatively charged, hydrophilic side chain at $\\theta_{8}=340^\\circ$ on the hydrophobic face. By the principles of amphipathic helices and helical wheel projections, introducing a hydrophilic, charged residue into the hydrophobic sector diminishes the segregation of polar and nonpolar residues, thereby reducing the hydrophobic moment and disrupting the amphipathic character. This is a local, direct effect on the helix’s amphipathicity; it neither enhances nor inverts the amphipathicity, and a single point mutation of this type does not typically abolish helicity altogether.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is the disruption of the amphipathic character by placing a hydrophilic residue on the hydrophobic face.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2112646"}]}
