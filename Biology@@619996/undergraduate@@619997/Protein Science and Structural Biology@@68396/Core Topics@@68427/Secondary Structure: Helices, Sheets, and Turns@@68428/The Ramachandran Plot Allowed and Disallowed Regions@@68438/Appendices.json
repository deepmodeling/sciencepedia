To assess the quality and stereochemical validity of the protein model, they decide to generate a Ramachandran plot.

The plot visualizes the conformational space occupied by the backbone of the protein chain.\n\nWhich of the following pairs of parameters, corresponding to a single amino acid residue, is extracted or calculated from the atomic coordinates in a PDB file to serve as the x and y coordinates for a single point on a standard Ramachandran plot?\n\nA.

The protein backbone is a chain of repeating units, with each unit corresponding to an amino acid residue. The core of this repeating unit is the sequence of atoms: $N-C_{\\alpha}-C$.\n\nWhile the bond lengths and bond angles within this backbone are relatively rigid, significant rotational freedom exists around some of the single bonds. These rotations are described by torsion angles, also known as dihedral angles. The conformation of the protein backbone is primarily determined by three such torsion angles per residue:\n\n1.  **Phi ($\\phi$) angle**: This is the torsion angle around the $N-C_{\\alpha}$ bond. It describes the rotation of the peptide plane preceding the $C_{\\alpha}$ atom relative to the plane containing the $C_{\\alpha}$ and its substituents.\n2.  **Psi ($\\psi$) angle**: This is the torsion angle around the $C_{\\alpha}-C$ bond. It describes the rotation of the peptide plane succeeding the $C_{\\alpha}$ atom.\n3.  **Omega ($\\omega$) angle**: This is the torsion angle around the peptide bond itself ($C-N$). Due to the partial double-bond character of the peptide bond, this rotation is highly restricted. The bond is almost always in the planar *trans* configuration ($\\omega \\approx 180^\\circ$), with the *cis* configuration ($\\omega \\approx 0^\\circ$) being very rare (mostly preceding proline residues).\n\nA Ramachandran plot is a two-dimensional scatter plot that visualizes the distribution of the primary degrees of freedom of the protein backbone. It plots the psi ($\\psi$) angle on the y-axis against the phi ($\\phi$) angle on the x-axis for each residue in the protein. Not all combinations of ($\\phi, \\psi$) are possible due to steric clashes between atoms. The plot, therefore, has \"allowed\" regions where most points are expected to fall (corresponding to structures like alpha-helices and beta-sheets) and \"disallowed\" regions. Each point on the plot represents the ($\\phi, \\psi$) pair for one residue. These angles are calculated from the 3D Cartesian coordinates of the relevant backbone atoms ($N, C_{\\alpha}, C$) stored in the PDB file.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A. The backbone torsion angles phi ($\\phi$) and psi ($\\psi$)**: This is the correct definition of the axes of a Ramachandran plot. These two angles represent the most significant conformational variables of the protein backbone.\n\n*   **B. The Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) of the alpha-carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$) atom**: While these coordinates are the fundamental data in a PDB file from which the angles are calculated, plotting them directly would simply trace the 3D path of the protein's backbone in space. This is not a Ramachandran plot.\n\n*   **C. The sidechain torsion angles, primarily chi-1 ($\\chi_1$) and chi-2 ($\\chi_2$)**: Chi angles describe the conformation of the amino acid sidechain, not the main backbone. While plots of chi angles (called rotamer plots) are also used in structural analysis, they are distinct from the Ramachandran plot, which focuses exclusively on the backbone.\n\n*   **D. The peptide bond torsion angle omega ($\\omega$) and the $N-C_{\\alpha}-C$ bond angle**: The $\\omega$ angle is generally not plotted because it is conformationally restricted to be near 180° and thus provides little information about structural variability. The $N-C_{\\alpha}-C$ angle is a bond angle, not a torsion angle. While its value is important, it has much less variability than $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ and is not a variable on the Ramachandran plot.\n\nTherefore, the specific data used to generate the points on a Ramachandran plot are the phi ($\\phi$) and psi ($\\psi$) torsion angles for each residue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2145805"}, {"introduction": "The 'allowed' and 'disallowed' regions of a Ramachandran plot are a direct consequence of steric hindrance. This thought experiment explores the unique case of glycine, whose minimal side chain provides the ultimate test of this principle.

The underlying principle is minimization of steric clashes; conformations with severe van der Waals overlap are disallowed, while those avoiding steric hindrance are allowed.\n\n2) Mechanistic determinant of allowed area: The size and geometry of the side chain set the degree of steric hindrance to rotations about the $N-C_{\\alpha}$ and $C_{\\alpha}-C$ bonds, and thus the extent of the allowed regions in $(\\phi,\\psi)$ space. A smaller side chain reduces steric clashes with the backbone carbonyl and amide, enlarging the allowed regions.\n\n3) Glycine’s unique side chain: Glycine’s side chain is a single hydrogen atom. This is the minimal possible side chain and therefore imposes the least steric hindrance on the backbone. Consequently, glycine exhibits markedly larger allowed regions on the Ramachandran plot relative to other amino acids with bulkier R-groups.\n\n4) Symmetry consideration: The observed point symmetry about $(\\phi,\\psi)=(0^{\\circ},0^{\\circ})$ for glycine arises because glycine is achiral; mirror-related conformations $(\\phi,\\psi)$ and $(-\\phi,-\\psi)$ are equivalent. This explains the symmetry feature specifically. However, the fundamental determinant of the enlarged allowed regions (the most prominent unique feature) is the reduction in steric hindrance due to the hydrogen side chain.\n\n5) Assessment of options:\n- A (achirality) correctly explains the symmetry but does not directly explain the enlarged allowed regions; it is not the most fundamental determinant of the plot’s broad permissiveness.\n- B (hydrogen side chain minimizing steric hindrance) directly addresses the core physical principle governing Ramachandran plots—steric exclusion—and explains the enlarged allowed regions; it is therefore the most direct and fundamental explanation.\n- C (nonpolar, uncharged) does not govern $(\\phi,\\psi)$ steric constraints.\n- D (smallest amino acid allowing tighter packing) refers to tertiary packing, not backbone dihedral constraints.\n- E (disrupts secondary structure) is a downstream structural tendency and not the fundamental basis of Ramachandran allowed regions.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and fundamental explanation is that glycine’s side chain is a single hydrogen atom, minimizing steric hindrance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2145800"}, {"introduction": "In sharp contrast to glycine's exceptional flexibility, the amino acid proline represents a case of extreme rigidity. Its unique cyclic structure, which covalently links the side chain back to the main-chain nitrogen, imposes severe limitations on backbone rotation.

The sterically allowed regions on a Ramachandran plot for any residue reflect the torsional freedom around these bonds subject to covalent geometry and steric constraints.\n\nProline’s side chain forms a pyrrolidine ring by covalently bonding to its own backbone nitrogen, making the amide nitrogen part of a five-membered ring. This has two key structural consequences:\n- The N is tertiary, lacking an amide proton, and is geometrically constrained by the ring. The most direct torsion affected by this ring closure is the $N-C_{\\alpha}$ bond, i.e., the $\\phi$ angle. Rotation around $N-C_{\\alpha}$ is severely restricted because twisting $\\phi$ distorts the ring, which has a high energetic penalty due to ring strain and steric clashes within the ring.\n- In contrast, the $C_{\\alpha}-C'$ bond, i.e., the $\\psi$ angle, is not part of the ring and retains comparatively greater conformational freedom, though still subject to steric limits.\n\nEmpirically and mechanistically, proline’s Ramachandran distribution is characterized by a narrow band of $\\phi$ values centered near $\\phi \\approx -75^{\\circ}$ with allowed $\\psi$ values predominantly in the positive region, including the polyproline II basin (e.g., $\\psi \\approx +145^{\\circ}$).
