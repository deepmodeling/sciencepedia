This first practice presents a thought experiment to illustrate a fundamental challenge in RNA-sequencing analysis: the compositional nature of the data. By considering a hypothetical comparison between organisms with different ploidy levels, this exercise [@problem_id:1740495] forces us to confront why directly comparing raw gene counts can be profoundly misleading and highlights the absolute necessity of normalization.", "problem": "Dr. Evelyn Reed, a botanist, is investigating the molecular basis of fruit size by comparing a wild, diploid strawberry species (*Fragaria vesca*, with 2 sets of chromosomes) and a large-fruited commercial, octoploid strawberry (*Fragaria x ananassa*, with 8 sets of chromosomes). Her experiment involves extracting the total messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) from an equal number of leaf cells ($10^6$ cells) from each species. She then prepares a ribonucleic acid-sequencing (RNA-seq) library for each sample. Both libraries are sequenced on the same machine to an identical total depth, meaning the total number of reads generated for the diploid sample is equal to the total number of reads generated for the octoploid sample.\n\nDr. Reed focuses on a specific gene, *Gene-X*, which is known to be a single-copy gene in the diploid species and has a clear one-to-one ortholog in the octoploid species. Assume that for the specific conditions tested, *Gene-X* is expressed at the exact same level in both species, meaning there is an identical number of *Gene-X* mRNA transcripts per individual cell.\n\nWhen Dr. Reed performs a direct comparison of the raw read counts for *Gene-X* between the two species, which of the following outcomes is the most likely consequence of the ploidy difference?\n\nA. The raw read count for *Gene-X* will be approximately four times higher in the octoploid compared to the diploid, reflecting the four-fold increase in chromosome sets.\n\nB. The raw read count for *Gene-X* will be approximately the same in both species because the per-cell transcript number is identical and the same number of cells were used.\n\nC. The comparison is invalid because the octoploid strawberry possesses multiple similar gene copies (homeologs) from its different subgenomes, making it impossible to uniquely assign reads to the true ortholog of *Gene-X*.\n\nD. The raw read count for *Gene-X* will be significantly lower in the octoploid species compared to the diploid species.\n\nE. The raw read counts will be highly variable and show no clear trend due to increased rates of transcription errors in polyploid organisms.", "solution": "Define $n$ as the number of cells per sample, $m_{X}$ as the number of Gene-X transcripts per cell (assumed identical in both species), and $D$ as the total number of sequencing reads per library (equal across species).\n\nThen the absolute number of Gene-X transcripts in each library is\n$$\nM_{X} = n m_{X}.\n$$\nLet $M_{\\text{tot,d}}$ and $M_{\\text{tot,o}}$ denote the total number of mRNA molecules in the diploid and octoploid libraries, respectively. Due to higher ploidy and transcriptome complexity, it is most reasonable to have\n$$\nM_{\\text{tot,o}} > M_{\\text{tot,d}}.\n$$\n\nAssuming unbiased library preparation and sequencing, reads are sampled approximately in proportion to transcript abundances. The expected raw read counts for Gene-X are therefore\n$$\nR_{d} = D \\cdot \\frac{M_{X}}{M_{\\text{tot,d}}}, \\qquad R_{o} = D \\cdot \\frac{M_{X}}{M_{\\text{tot,o}}}.\n$$\nTaking the ratio gives\n$$\n\\frac{R_{o}}{R_{d}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{tot,d}}}{M_{\\text{tot,o}}} < 1,\n$$\nbecause $M_{\\text{tot,o}} > M_{\\text{tot,d}}$ while $D$ and $M_{X}$ are equal between species. Thus, even though the absolute number of Gene-X transcripts ($M_{X}$) is the same in both samples, the fraction of Gene-X molecules in the octoploid library is smaller, so its raw read count is expected to be lower under equal sequencing depth.\n\nThis rules out:\n- A, because per-cell expression is fixed and not four-fold higher in the octoploid.\n- B, because raw counts reflect relative abundance under fixed depth, not absolute molecule numbers alone.\n- C, because the problem stipulates a clear one-to-one ortholog, removing mapping ambiguity.\n- E, because increased transcription error rates are neither implied nor a driver of systematic raw-count differences under these assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is a lower raw read count for Gene-X in the octoploid sample compared to the diploid sample.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1740495"}, {"introduction": "Having established the need for normalization, we can now move to the quantitative skills required to implement it.

A common technique is RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), which quantifies the abundance of messenger RNA molecules for every gene. To compare expression levels accurately, raw read counts must be normalized. One widely used normalization method is Transcripts Per Million (TPM). The TPM for a gene $i$ is calculated as:\n$$TPM_i = \\left( \\frac{N_i / L_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{M} (N_j / L_j)} \\right) \\times 10^6$$\nwhere $N_i$ is the raw read count for gene $i$, $L_i$ is the length of gene $i$'s transcript, and the sum in the denominator is taken over all $M$ genes in the transcriptome.\n\nConsider an experiment comparing a sun-adapted cactus (*Opuntia ficus-indica*) and a shade-adapted fern (*Asplenium nidus*).
