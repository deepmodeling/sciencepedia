They perform Whole-Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequencing, which generates a large number of short DNA reads randomly sampled from the genome. To estimate the size of the genome, they use k-mer analysis. A 'k-mer' is a subsequence of length $k$ from a DNA read. For this project, a k-mer size of $k=21$ was used.\n\nThe total amount of sequence data generated by the sequencer is $125.8$ Gigabase pairs (Gbp). The reads are then broken down into all possible k-mers, and the frequency of each unique k-mer is counted and plotted on a histogram (frequency vs. coverage depth). The analysis reveals a major, well-defined peak corresponding to k-mers from homozygous regions of the genome. The center of this peak is located at a coverage depth of $55\\text{x}$.\n\nAssuming this peak accurately represents the average sequencing coverage across the genome, calculate the estimated haploid genome size of this plant.

This cost can be broken down into two main components: the *de novo* synthesis of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), the building blocks of DNA, and the polymerization of these dNTPs into new DNA strands.\n\nConsider the energetic cost in terms of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecules for replicating the genomes of two plant species: common barley (*Hordeum vulgare*) and thale cress (*Arabidopsis thaliana*).\n\nAssume the following data for the analysis:\n1.
