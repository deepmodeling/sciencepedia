This conceptual exercise challenges you to apply the evolutionary principle of \"use it or lose it\" to a classic biological scenario. By analyzing the fate of osmoregulatory genes in a newly landlocked salmon population, you will sharpen your intuition for how natural selection's focus shifts when previously crucial adaptations become obsolete [@problem_id:1772867].", "problem": "Anadromous fish, such as salmon, have a remarkable life cycle that involves migrating from their freshwater birthplace to the ocean to mature, and then returning to freshwater to reproduce. This dual-habitat life requires two distinct and complex sets of physiological machinery for osmoregulation. In freshwater, which is hypotonic to the fish's body fluids, the fish must actively uptake salts from the environment and excrete a large volume of dilute urine to combat the constant influx of water. In the ocean, which is hypertonic, the fish must drink seawater, actively excrete excess salts through specialized cells in its gills, and produce minimal, concentrated urine to conserve water.\n\nConsider a large, genetically diverse population of salmon that becomes permanently trapped in a vast, stable freshwater lake after a geological event (e.g., a landslide) blocks their migratory route to the sea. Over many generations, this population successfully establishes itself as a self-sustaining, purely freshwater species.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary evolutionary pressure acting on the two sets of osmoregulatory genes (one for saltwater adaptation, one for freshwater adaptation) in this now landlocked population?\n\nA. The genes for saltwater osmoregulation will be under relaxed selection, as the functions they encode are no longer required and maintaining them incurs a metabolic cost without providing any fitness benefit.\n\nB. The genes for freshwater osmoregulation will be under relaxed selection, as the stable, predictable environment of the lake is less osmotically challenging than a variable river system.\n\nC. Both the freshwater and saltwater osmoregulatory gene sets will be under intensified purifying selection, as the fish must fine-tune their physiology to the specific ionic composition of their new, permanent home.\n\nD. Both sets of genes will be under disruptive selection, favoring individuals at the extremes of either high-salt or low-salt tolerance to exploit different micro-niches within the lake.\n\nE. All genes related to osmoregulation will become effectively neutral, as the primary selective pressures will shift entirely to foraging and avoiding predation in the new lacustrine environment.", "solution": "Key evolutionary principle: selection acts on variation affecting fitness in the prevailing environment. When a trait no longer contributes to fitness because its associated environment is absent, its underlying genes experience relaxed selection; deleterious mutations are no longer efficiently purged, and costs of maintaining unused machinery can favor reduction or loss. Conversely, genes essential for survival in the current environment remain under purifying selection to maintain function.\n\nApplication to the scenario:\n- In the ocean, anadromous salmon require saltwater osmoregulation (drinking seawater, active ion excretion through gill chloride cells, concentrated urine). In permanent freshwater isolation, that functionality provides no fitness benefit because saltwater is never encountered.\n- Maintaining the saltwater program entails costs (e.g., transcription/translation, regulatory maintenance, potential pleiotropic side effects). Without benefits, selection no longer favors its retention; therefore, variants that reduce or disable the saltwater pathway will not be selected against unless they harm freshwater performance. This is the definition of relaxed selection and often leads to pseudogenization via drift or even positive selection for loss if expression is costly.\n- Freshwater osmoregulation remains essential (active ion uptake, dilute urine production), so mutations impairing these functions reduce fitness and are removed by purifying selection, not relaxed selection.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A correctly identifies relaxed selection on saltwater osmoregulatory genes due to loss of use and cost without benefit.\n- B is incorrect: freshwater osmoregulation remains necessary; a stable lake does not eliminate osmotic challenges.\n- C is incorrect: saltwater genes would not be under intensified purifying selection when unused.\n- D is unlikely: disruptive selection on salt tolerance requires distinct fitness peaks within the lake; here, the key axis (marine vs freshwater) has collapsed to a single regime.\n- E is incorrect: osmoregulation is still vital in freshwater; those genes are not neutral.\n\nTherefore, the primary evolutionary pressure is relaxed selection on the saltwater osmoregulatory gene set, while freshwater genes remain under purifying selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1772867"}, {"introduction": "Once a gene is no longer under selection to maintain its function, it doesn't disappear instantly. Instead, it begins a slow process of decay. This practice moves from qualitative concepts to quantitative modeling, allowing you to calculate the probability that a gene will survive over a long evolutionary timescale [@problem_id:1772846]. By modeling the accumulation of random, loss-of-function mutations, you will gain a tangible understanding of the \"molecular clock\" that governs the decay of now-useless genetic information.", "problem": "A lineage of aquatic insects, previously reliant on an oxygen-transport protein for survival in deep water, colonizes a new, highly-aerated, shallow water environment. Due to a concurrent evolutionary trend towards microscopic size, these insects can now meet all their metabolic oxygen requirements through simple gas diffusion across their body surface. Consequently, the gene encoding their primary oxygen-transport protein is no longer under purifying (negative) selection, as its function has become redundant.\n\nAssume that the rate at which random mutations cause a complete loss of function in this specific gene is $\\mu = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ per gene, per generation. Any such mutation is now selectively neutral, meaning it has no effect on the insect's survival or reproduction.\n\nCalculate the probability that the functional version of this gene will persist in a given lineage after $G = 200,000$ generations have passed since the shift in environment.

In each generation, the probability that this copy does not acquire a loss-of-function mutation is $1-\\mu$.

This exercise bridges the gap between evolutionary theory and real-world genomic analysis.", "problem": "A population biologist is studying the evolution of an antiviral gene, *Oas1* (Oligoadenylate synthetase 1), in the blue finch, *Fringilla caerulea*. The species has three distinct subspecies with a well-established phylogeny: the island subspecies (*F. c. insularis*) and the eastern subspecies (*F. c. orientalis*) are sister taxa, and together they form a clade with the mainland subspecies (*F. c. continentalis*) as the outgroup.\n\nHistorically, a pathogen known as Calicivirus Fringillidae (CVF) was endemic in the habitats of both *F. c. insularis* and *F. c. orientalis*, and the *Oas1* gene is known to be crucial for conferring resistance. The *F. c. continentalis* population has never been exposed to CVF. A successful eradication program eliminated CVF from the island habitat of *F. c. insularis* in the recent past, while the virus remains endemic in the eastern population.\n\nThe biologist wants to determine if the *Oas1* gene in the island population is now evolving under relaxed selection (i.e., its antiviral function is obsolete, and it is accumulating mutations neutrally) or if it is being maintained by pleiotropic constraint (i.e., it has other essential functions that are still under purifying selection).\n\nTo investigate this, the biologist sequenced the *Oas1* gene from all three subspecies and calculated the pairwise evolutionary distances, corrected for multiple hits. The rates of non-synonymous substitutions ($d_N$) and synonymous substitutions ($d_S$) per site are given in the table below.\n\n| Pairwise Comparison | $d_N$ (substitutions/site) | $d_S$ (substitutions/site) |\n|---|---|---|\n| *insularis* vs. *orientalis* | 0.030 | 0.050 |\n| *insularis* vs. *continentalis* | 0.090 | 0.120 |\n| *orientalis* vs. *continentalis* | 0.112 | 0.130 |\n\nCalculate the non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio ($\\omega$) for the *Oas1* gene specifically along the *F. c. insularis* lineage since its divergence from *F. c. orientalis*.
