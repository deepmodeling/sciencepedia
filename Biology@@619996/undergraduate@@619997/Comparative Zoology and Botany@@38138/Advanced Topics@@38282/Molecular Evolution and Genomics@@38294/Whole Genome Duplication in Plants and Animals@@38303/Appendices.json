This exercise provides a foundational practice in cytogenetics, the study of chromosome structure and number. By analyzing the somatic chromosome counts from a group of related species, you will learn to identify a polyploid series and determine the basic chromosome number, or monoploid number ($x$), an essential first step in investigating WGD events in nature. [@problem_id:1783434]", "problem": "A field biologist is investigating the evolutionary relationships within the genus *Leucanthemum*, commonly known as ox-eye daisies. Through cytogenetic analysis, the biologist determines the somatic chromosome numbers for three distinct but closely related species co-existing in an alpine ecosystem. The results are as follows:\n\n- *Leucanthemum vulgare*: The total number of chromosomes in a somatic cell is 18.\n- *Leucanthemum ircutianum*: The total number of chromosomes in a somatic cell is 36.\n- *Leucanthemum atratum*: The total number of chromosomes in a somatic cell is 54.\n\nIt is hypothesized that this species group arose from a common ancestor through a series of whole genome duplication events, a process known as polyploidy. In such a series, species with a lower chromosome number are generally considered more ancestral. Based on the provided data, which of the following statements offers the most scientifically accurate description of these three species?\n\nA. The basic monoploid chromosome number for this genus is $x=18$. *L. vulgare* is diploid, *L. ircutianum* is tetraploid, and *L. atratum* is hexaploid.\n\nB. The basic monoploid chromosome number for this genus is $x=9$. *L. vulgare* is a diploid, *L. ircutianum* is a tetraploid, and *L. atratum* is a hexaploid.\n\nC. The basic monoploid chromosome number for this genus is $x=9$. *L. vulgare* is a haploid, *L. ircutianum* is a diploid, and *L. atratum* is a triploid.\n\nD. This is an example of aneuploidy. The common ancestor had 18 chromosomes, and subsequent non-disjunction events led to the creation of the other two species.\n\nE. All three species are diploids that evolved from different ancestors, and the similarity in chromosome numbers is coincidental.", "solution": "Let $x$ denote the basic monoploid chromosome number (the number of distinct chromosomes in one complete set). In cytogenetics, the somatic chromosome number is conventionally denoted $2n$ for all ploidy levels, with:\n- diploid: $2n=2x$\n- tetraploid: $2n=4x$\n- hexaploid: $2n=6x$\n\nGiven the observed somatic counts $18$, $36$, and $54$, assume the lowest count represents the diploid condition under a polyploid series (consistent with the hypothesis that higher counts arose by whole-genome duplications from a common ancestor).

Building on an understanding of polyploid chromosome sets, this next exercise explores the consequences for genetic transmission. You will apply principles of combinatorics to model meiotic segregation in an autotetraploid and calculate the probabilities of different gamete genotypes, highlighting a key departure from simple Mendelian genetics. [@problem_id:1783436]", "problem": "A team of plant geneticists is developing a new ornamental potato variety. They start with a standard diploid potato plant that is heterozygous ($Aa$) at a specific locus controlling tuber skin color. The allele $A$ results in purple skin, while the recessive allele $a$ results in red skin. To create a more robust plant with larger tubers, they treat the diploid plant with colchicine, an agent that induces whole genome duplication. This process results in a viable autotetraploid plant with four sets of homologous chromosomes. The genotype of this new autotetraploid plant at the skin color locus is therefore $AAaa$.\n\nDuring meiosis, the four homologous chromosomes at this locus segregate. Assume that two chromosomes migrate to one pole and the other two migrate to the opposite pole randomly and with equal probability. This process, known as random chromosomal segregation, ultimately produces diploid gametes.\n\nCalculate the probability that a randomly selected gamete from this $AAaa$ autotetraploid plant carries the genotype $aa$. Express your answer as a single fraction in its simplest form.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability of forming an $aa$ gamete from an autotetraploid plant with genotype $AAaa$.\n\nFirst, let's identify the genetic material at the locus of interest. The plant's genotype is $AAaa$, which means it possesses four homologous chromosomes carrying the alleles for this gene. For clarity, let's label these four chromosomes based on the allele they carry: $A_1$, $A_2$, $a_1$, and $a_2$.\n\nThe problem states that during meiosis I, two of these four chromosomes migrate to one pole, and the other two migrate to the opposite pole. A gamete's genotype is determined by the two chromosomes it receives after both meiotic divisions. We can model this by considering all possible combinations of two chromosomes that can be segregated together into a pre-gamete cell.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 2 chromosomes out of the 4 available is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n=4$ is the total number of chromosomes and $k=2$ is the number of chromosomes segregating to one pole.\n\nTotal number of combinations = $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(2 \\times 1)} = 6$.\n\nThese 6 combinations are equally likely under the assumption of random chromosomal segregation. Let's list these combinations and the resulting gamete genotype for each.\n\n1.  The two chromosomes carrying the $A$ allele are chosen: $\\{A_1, A_2\\}$. After meiosis II, this will result in a gamete with the genotype $AA$.\n2.  One chromosome with $A$ and one with $a$ are chosen: $\\{A_1, a_1\\}$. This results in a gamete with the genotype $Aa$.\n3.  One chromosome with $A$ and the other with $a$ are chosen: $\\{A_1, a_2\\}$. This also results in a gamete with the genotype $Aa$.\n4.  The other chromosome with $A$ and one with $a$ are chosen: $\\{A_2, a_1\\}$. This also results in a gamete with the genotype $Aa$.\n5.  The other chromosome with $A$ and the other with $a$ are chosen: $\\{A_2, a_2\\}$. This also results in a gamete with the genotype $Aa$.\n6.  The two chromosomes carrying the $a$ allele are chosen: $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$. This results in a gamete with the genotype $aa$.\n\nSo, we have the following distribution of possible gamete genotypes from these 6 equally likely segregation events:\n-   $AA$: 1 case\n-   $Aa$: 4 cases\n-   $aa$: 1 case\n\nThe question asks for the probability of producing a gamete with genotype $aa$. Out of the 6 possible and equally likely outcomes, only one results in an $aa$ gamete.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n$P(aa) = \\frac{\\text{Number of ways to form an } aa \\text{ gamete}}{\\text{Total number of possible gametes}} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nThe problem can also be solved by finding the number of ways to choose 2 `$a$` alleles from the 2 available `$a$` alleles, and dividing it by the total number of ways to choose 2 alleles from the 4 available alleles.\n-   Number of ways to choose 2 `$a$` alleles from the available 2 is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$.\n-   Total number of ways to choose any 2 alleles from the 4 available is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n\nThe probability is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$P(aa) = \\frac{\\binom{2}{2}}{\\binom{4}{2}} = \\frac{1}{6}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$$", "id": "1783436"}, {"introduction": "Whole genome duplication is not just a genetic curiosity; it is a major evolutionary force.
