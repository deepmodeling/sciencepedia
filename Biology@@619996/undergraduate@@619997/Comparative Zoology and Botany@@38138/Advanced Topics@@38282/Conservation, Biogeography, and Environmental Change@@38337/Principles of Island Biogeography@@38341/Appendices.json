{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The equilibrium theory of island biogeography, developed by Robert H. MacArthur and E. O. Wilson, provides a foundational framework for understanding the distribution of species. It posits that the number of species on an island represents a dynamic balance between the rate of immigration of new species and the rate of extinction of existing ones. This first exercise [@problem_id:1770881] is a conceptual test of these core principles, asking you to qualitatively rank islands based on their size and isolation, the two key factors that govern extinction and immigration rates, respectively.", "problem": "A team of herpetologists is studying a newly formed volcanic archipelago located off a large, species-rich continent. They identify four islands of interest that are ecologically similar in all respects except for their size and distance from the mainland. The islands are cataloged as follows:\n\n*   **Island Alpha:** A large island near the continent.\n*   **Island Beta:** A small island near the continent.\n*   **Island Gamma:** A large island far from the continent.\n*   **Island Delta:** A small island far from the continent.\n\nThe team's research focuses on amphibians (such as frogs and salamanders), which are the primary terrestrial vertebrates colonizing these islands. It is known that amphibians, as a group, are generally poor at dispersing across saltwater barriers. Assuming the islands have been present long enough to approach a stable number of species, which of the following options correctly ranks the islands from the highest predicted number of resident amphibian species to the lowest?\n\nA.

Beta > Alpha > Delta > Gamma", "solution": "We apply the MacArthurâ€“Wilson island biogeography framework, which models equilibrium species richness as the point where the immigration rate equals the extinction rate. Let $S$ denote the number of species present, $S_{pool}$ the size of the mainland species pool, $d$ the island-mainland distance, and $A$ the island area. Let $I(S; d)$ be the immigration rate and $E(S; A)$ the extinction rate. The standard linear forms are\n$$\nI(S; d) = I_{0}(d)\\left(1 - \\frac{S}{S_{pool}}\\right), \\quad E(S; A) = E_{0}(A)\\left(\\frac{S}{S_{pool}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $I_{0}(d)$ is the maximum immigration rate when $S=0$, and $E_{0}(A)$ is the maximum extinction rate when $S=S_{pool}$. By ecological principles:\n- $I_{0}(d)$ is strictly decreasing in $d$ (near islands have higher colonization).\n- $E_{0}(A)$ is strictly decreasing in $A$ (larger islands have lower extinction).\n\nAt equilibrium $S^{*}$, we set $I(S^{*}; d) = E(S^{*}; A)$:\n$$\nI_{0}(d)\\left(1 - \\frac{S^{*}}{S_{pool}}\\right) = E_{0}(A)\\left(\\frac{S^{*}}{S_{pool}}\\right).\n$$\nSolve for $S^{*}$ algebraically:\n$$\nI_{0}(d) - I_{0}(d)\\frac{S^{*}}{S_{pool}} = E_{0}(A)\\frac{S^{*}}{S_{pool}}\n\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\nI_{0}(d) = \\left(I_{0}(d) + E_{0}(A)\\right)\\frac{S^{*}}{S_{pool}},\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{S^{*}}{S_{pool}} = \\frac{I_{0}(d)}{I_{0}(d) + E_{0}(A)}\n\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\nS^{*}(A,d) = \\frac{I_{0}(d)}{I_{0}(d) + E_{0}(A)}\\,S_{pool}.\n$$\nFrom this expression, $S^{*}$ increases with $I_{0}(d)$ (hence decreases with $d$) and increases as $E_{0}(A)$ decreases (hence increases with $A$). Therefore, holding other factors constant:\n- Nearer islands (smaller $d$) have larger $I_{0}(d)$ and thus larger $S^{*}$.\n- Larger islands (larger $A$) have smaller $E_{0}(A)$ and thus larger $S^{*}$.\n\nAmphibians are poor dispersers across saltwater, which implies that $I_{0}(d)$ declines very rapidly with increasing $d$; equivalently, the effect of isolation is strong. In comparative terms, for near distance $d_{n}$ and far distance $d_{f}$ with $d_{f} > d_{n}$, amphibians satisfy $I_{0}(d_{f}) \\ll I_{0}(d_{n})$. For large area $A_{L}$ and small area $A_{S}$ with $A_{L} > A_{S}$, we have $E_{0}(A_{L}) < E_{0}(A_{S})$, but the isolation effect on $I_{0}(d)$ dominates for poor dispersers.\n\nRank each island by $S^{*}(A,d) = \\frac{I_{0}(d)}{I_{0}(d) + E_{0}(A)}S_{pool}$:\n- Island Alpha (large, near): $A=A_{L}$, $d=d_{n}$ gives large $I_{0}(d_{n})$ and small $E_{0}(A_{L})$, thus the largest $S^{*}$.\n- Island Delta (small, far): $A=A_{S}$, $d=d_{f}$ gives small $I_{0}(d_{f})$ and large $E_{0}(A_{S})$, thus the smallest $S^{*}$.\n- Island Beta (small, near) versus Island Gamma (large, far): \n  $$S^{*}_{\\text{Beta}} = \\frac{I_{0}(d_{n})}{I_{0}(d_{n}) + E_{0}(A_{S})}S_{pool}, \\quad S^{*}_{\\text{Gamma}} = \\frac{I_{0}(d_{f})}{I_{0}(d_{f}) + E_{0}(A_{L})}S_{pool}.$$\n  For amphibians, $I_{0}(d_{f})$ is very small, making $S^{*}_{\\text{Gamma}}$ small even with $A_{L}$, while $I_{0}(d_{n})$ is large enough that $S^{*}_{\\text{Beta}}$ exceeds $S^{*}_{\\text{Gamma}}$. Hence $S^{*}_{\\text{Beta}} > S^{*}_{\\text{Gamma}}$.\n\nPutting these together: Alpha > Beta > Gamma > Delta, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1770881"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a qualitative understanding to a quantitative application allows us to appreciate the predictive power of the equilibrium model.
