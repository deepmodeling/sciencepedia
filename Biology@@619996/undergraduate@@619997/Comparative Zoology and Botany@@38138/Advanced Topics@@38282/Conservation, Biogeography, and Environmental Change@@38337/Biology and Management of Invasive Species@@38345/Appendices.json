This exercise explores the concept of phenotypic plasticity—the ability of an organism to change its form or function in response to the environment—as a key invasive trait. By calculating and comparing a plasticity index for an invasive and a native plant species, you will gain hands-on experience in quantifying this important biological characteristic and understanding how it can confer a competitive advantage across different environmental conditions [@problem_id:1734064].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the success of an invasive plant species, *Acanthus fulgur*, in a temperate grassland ecosystem where the native species *Silene tranquilla* is common. The ecologist hypothesizes that the invasive species exhibits greater phenotypic plasticity in resource allocation, allowing it to outcompete the native species across different soil conditions. To test this, a controlled greenhouse experiment was conducted. Seedlings of both species were grown in two soil treatments: nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich. After several weeks, the plants were harvested, and the dry mass of their roots and shoots were measured.\n\nThe trait of interest is the root-to-shoot ratio (R:S ratio), calculated as the dry mass of the roots divided by the dry mass of the shoots. A measure of phenotypic plasticity for a given trait is the Phenotypic Plasticity Index (PI), which is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{PI} = \\frac{|\\text{mean value in environment 1} - \\text{mean value in environment 2}|}{\\text{maximum of the two mean values}}\n$$\nHere are the mean dry mass values (in grams) from the experiment:\n\n**Invasive Species: *Acanthus fulgur***\n-   Nutrient-Poor Soil: Mean Root Mass = 8.12 g, Mean Shoot Mass = 3.98 g\n-   Nutrient-Rich Soil: Mean Root Mass = 9.85 g, Mean Shoot Mass = 25.26 g\n\n**Native Species: *Silene tranquilla***\n-   Nutrient-Poor Soil: Mean Root Mass = 6.45 g, Mean Shoot Mass = 5.29 g\n-   Nutrient-Rich Soil: Mean Root Mass = 7.02 g, Mean Shoot Mass = 13.77 g\n\nCalculate the ratio of the Phenotypic Plasticity Index of the invasive species to that of the native species (i.e., $\\text{PI}_{\\text{invasive}} / \\text{PI}_{\\text{native}}$).
