This exercise introduces the crucial concept of effective population size ($N_e$), the number of individuals that contribute genes to the next generation. By calculating $N_e$ from demographic data, you will see how factors like fluctuating population sizes and skewed sex ratios can dramatically reduce a population's genetic health, a principle demonstrated here using the case of a cryptic salamander species [@problem_id:1770015].", "problem": "A team of conservation biologists has been studying a widespread salamander species, *Ambystoma unitum*, which was thought to have a stable total population of approximately 500,000 individuals. However, recent genetic sequencing has revealed that this is not a single species but a cryptic species complex consisting of five distinct, reproductively isolated species. One of these newly identified species, *Ambystoma relictus*, is found to have a total census population size ($N_c$) of only 2,500 individuals, restricted to a few high-altitude springs.\n\nTo assess its genetic viability and risk of extinction, a monitoring program was conducted over three consecutive breeding seasons (which correspond to three generations for this species). The program recorded the number of sexually mature males ($N_m$) and females ($N_f$) that contributed to the next generation each year. The data are as follows:\n- Year 1: 120 breeding males, 80 breeding females.\n- Year 2: 90 breeding males, 65 breeding females.\n- Year 3: 150 breeding males, 50 breeding females.\n\nThe rate of genetic drift in a population is not determined by its census size ($N_c$) but by its effective population size ($N_e$), which is the size of an idealized population that would experience the same amount of genetic drift as the actual population.\n\nFor a population with an unequal number of breeding males and females in a given generation, the effective population size for that generation is given by:\n$$N_e = \\frac{4 N_m N_f}{N_m + N_f}$$\n\nWhen the effective population size fluctuates across generations, the long-term effective population size ($N_{e, \\text{long-term}}$) is determined by the harmonic mean of the per-generation effective sizes.

This practice explores the dangerous phenomenon of an 'ecological trap,' where animals are lured into seemingly attractive areas that actually reduce their fitness.

The species' habitat has been reduced to a single, small remnant of a natural wetland. A larger wetland has been restored nearby to increase the available habitat. At the beginning of each breeding season, the entire adult frog population distributes itself between the natural and restored wetlands to breed. The restored wetland, due to its apparently ideal vegetation density and water depth, is four times more attractive to the frogs than the remnant natural wetland, meaning four times as many adults choose to breed there.\n\nLet the total adult population at the start of the breeding season be $N_t$. The life cycle dynamics of the frog metapopulation are described by the following parameters:\n- The annual survival probability for an adult frog from one breeding season to the next is $s_A = 0.40$. This rate is independent of where the frog bred.\n- An adult frog produces, on average, $b=10$ offspring that successfully hatch into tadpoles, regardless of the wetland type.\n- The probability of a tadpole surviving to become a breeding adult in the next season is dependent on the wetland. In the natural wetland, this juvenile survival probability is $s_N = 0.15$. However, the restored wetland contains a high density of a cryptic, invasive crayfish species, which preys heavily on tadpoles, reducing the juvenile survival probability to $s_R = 0.02$.\n\nAssuming these parameters remain constant and the frogs continue to distribute themselves according to the attractiveness of the wetlands, calculate the overall metapopulation's annual finite rate of increase, $\\lambda$, defined as the ratio of the total population in the next year to the total population in the current year ($\\lambda = N_{t+1}/N_t$).
