They both grow to a similar maximum height.\n\nThe seeds of *A. volans* are very light and have wing-like structures, allowing for effective wind dispersal. Consider a seed from this species being released from a height $H = 25.0$ m into a steady horizontal wind of speed $v_{wind} = 5.00$ m/s. Due to its low mass and high air resistance, the seed is assumed to fall vertically at its constant terminal velocity, $v_{t} = 0.400$ m/s, relative to the air around it. The horizontal motion of the seed is determined solely by the wind.\n\nThe seeds of *Z. ponderosa* are heavy nuts. They are primarily dispersed by a species of forest rodent that collects the nuts and buries them in caches for later consumption. This rodent forages within a circular home range of radius $R_{home} = 215$ m, centered on the parent tree. For the purpose of this problem, the characteristic dispersal distance for *Z. ponderosa* is defined as the average distance from the center of a circle to any randomly chosen point within that circle.

The Theory of Island Biogeography, developed by Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson, posits that species richness on an island represents a dynamic balance between immigration and extinction. A key related concept is \"faunal relaxation,\" the loss of species that occurs when a habitat fragment, like a newly formed island, is isolated from a larger landmass.

Approximately 10,000 years ago, post-glacial sea-level rise inundated coastal lowlands, isolating a mountainous peninsula and forming the island of Borealis. The newly formed island has an area of $A_I = 40,000$ square kilometers. At the moment of its formation ($t=0$), the island of Borealis retained the full complement of the mainland's 50 large mammal species ($S_0 = 50$).\n\nThe equilibrium number of species, $S_{eq}$, that an isolated area can support is governed by the species-area relationship, given by $S = cA^z$, where $c$ is a constant specific to the taxonomic group and region, $A$ is the area, and $z$ is an exponent. For large mammals in continental-type habitats, the value of the exponent is $z = 0.15$.\n\nFollowing isolation, the island undergoes \"faunal relaxation,\" a process where the species number declines from its initial supersaturated state towards the new, lower equilibrium number. The number of species at a time $t$ after isolation, $S(t)$, can be modeled by the equation:\n$$S(t) = S_{eq} + (S_0 - S_{eq}) \\exp(-k_{rel} t)$$\nwhere $k_{rel}$ is the relaxation rate constant. The process is characterized by a relaxation half-life, $T_{1/2}$, which is the time required for the number of species in excess of the final equilibrium value to be reduced by half. For the large mammals on Borealis, this half-life is estimated to be $T_{1/2} = 4000$ years.\n\nCalculate the predicted number of large mammal species present on the island of Borealis today, 10,000 years after its isolation.
