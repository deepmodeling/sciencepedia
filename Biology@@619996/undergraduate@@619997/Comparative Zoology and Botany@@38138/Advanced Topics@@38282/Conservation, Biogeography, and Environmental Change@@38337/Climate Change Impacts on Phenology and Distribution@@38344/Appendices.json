A critical issue arises when interacting species shift their timing at different rates, leading to a \"phenological mismatch.\" This exercise provides a foundational model for this concept, exploring a hypothetical interaction between a frog species whose breeding is cued by temperature and its invertebrate prey whose life cycle is cued by day length. By calculating the growing asynchrony over several decades, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how differential responses to environmental cues can disrupt historically synchronized ecological relationships, such as those between predators and prey.

Ecologists have been studying the interaction between these frogs and their primary food source during the tadpole stage, which consists of aquatic invertebrates.\n\nIn a reference year, designated as Year 0, the following baseline observations were made:\n- The pond ice melts completely (ice-off) on April 15th, which is the 105th day of the year.\n- The frogs begin their breeding rituals exactly 5 days after ice-off.\n- The frog eggs hatch into tadpoles, which require immediate food, 10 days after breeding begins.\n- In Year 0, the peak abundance of the aquatic invertebrate prey is perfectly synchronized with the hatching of the tadpoles. This invertebrate peak is primarily cued by photoperiod and thus occurs on the same calendar day each year.\n\nDue to regional climate warming, the date of ice-off has been advancing (occurring earlier) at a steady rate of 0.45 days per year.\n\nAssuming this rate of advance remains constant, calculate the phenological mismatch after 40 years of warming. The phenological mismatch is defined as the absolute difference in days between the date of tadpole hatching and the date of the invertebrate peak.\n\nExpress your final answer in days, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "In Year 0, ice-off is on day 105, breeding begins 5 days later on day 110, and tadpoles hatch 10 days after breeding begins, on day 120. The invertebrate peak is photoperiod-cued and fixed on day 120 each year.\n\nLet $t$ be the number of years after Year 0. The ice-off date advances earlier at a constant rate of $0.45$ days per year, so the ice-off day is\n$$105 - 0.45 t.$$\nBreeding begins 5 days after ice-off, on\n$$105 - 0.45 t + 5 = 110 - 0.45 t,$$\nand hatching occurs 10 days after breeding begins, on\n$$110 - 0.45 t + 10 = 120 - 0.45 t.$$\nThe invertebrate peak remains fixed at day 120.

However, a species' success in colonizing new habitats is not solely determined by its climatic tolerances; it is also heavily dependent on its intrinsic biological traits. This practice examines a crucial limiting factor: the reproductive system. Through a comparative thought experiment, you will analyze how mating systems—specifically self-compatibility versus self-incompatibility—can determine the fate of a founder individual in an isolated patch. Understanding this principle, often encapsulated in Baker's Law, is essential for predicting which species are likely to be successful colonizers in a fragmented, changing world. [@problem_id:1736614]", "problem": "A large-scale habitat restoration project has created several new, isolated patches of prairie habitat separated by vast stretches of agricultural land. A single viable seed of a wind-pollinated grass, *Andropogon gerardii* (Species G), lands and germinates in one new patch. In another identical but separate patch, a single viable seed of an insect-pollinated flowering plant, *Echinacea angustifolia* (Species F), also lands and germinates. Both plants grow to maturity. Key biological traits of these species are as follows:\n- *Andropogon gerardii* (Species G) is self-compatible, meaning it can produce viable offspring through self-pollination.\n- *Echinacea angustifolia* (Species F) is genetically self-incompatible, meaning it requires pollen from a genetically different individual of the same species to produce seeds.\n\nAssume no other individuals of either species are present in the new patches or in the immediate surroundings, and both individuals are capable of producing both male (pollen) and female (ovules) gametes.\n\nWhich of the following statements best predicts the immediate reproductive fate of these two founder individuals in their respective patches?\n\nA. Both Species G and Species F will successfully establish a new population, as a single plant can produce both male and female gametes.\n\nB. Species F (*Echinacea*) will be more successful because insect pollination is more targeted and effective than wind pollination, ensuring any available pollen fertilizes the plant.\n\nC. Both species will fail to establish a population because of the severe genetic bottleneck and resulting inbreeding depression from a single founder.\n\nD. Species G (*Andropogon*) can establish a new population through self-pollination, whereas Species F (*Echinacea*) will fail to reproduce due to its self-incompatibility system.\n\nE.

Define species and their mating systems:\n- Species G is self-compatible. By definition, self-compatibility permits fertilization by self-pollen, so the probability that an ovule is fertilized by pollen from the same plant is strictly positive, i.e., $P_{\\text{self}}^{G} > 0$.\n- Species F is genetically self-incompatible. By definition, self-incompatibility prevents fertilization by self-pollen due to recognition at incompatibility loci (e.g., $S$-locus), so the probability that an ovule is fertilized by pollen from the same plant is zero, i.e., $P_{\\text{self}}^{F} = 0$.\n\n2. Environmental context:\n- Each patch contains exactly one conspecific individual: one $G$ individual in one patch and one $F$ individual in the other. There are no other conspecifics nearby, so there is no external pollen source for either species.\n\n3. Consequences for fertilization:\n- For Species G: Because $P_{\\text{self}}^{G} > 0$ and self-pollen is available from the same individual, expected seed set is positive. Symbolically, the expected seed production satisfies $E[\\text{seeds} \\mid G] > 0$ in the immediate generation.\n- For Species F: Because $P_{\\text{self}}^{F} = 0$ and there are no genetically distinct conspecifics ($g' \\neq g$) to provide compatible pollen, the probability of any ovule receiving compatible pollen is zero. Hence, $E[\\text{seeds} \\mid F] = 0$ in the immediate generation.\n\n4. Pollination vector considerations:\n- Wind versus insect pollination affects pollen transfer between individuals, but with only one conspecific present, the pollination vector cannot create compatible outcross pollen for Species F. Thus, insect pollination does not alter $E[\\text{seeds} \\mid F] = 0$.\n- For Species G, wind pollination is not a limiting factor for selfing because self-pollen is produced by the same plant and can effect fertilization without requiring conspecific neighbors.\n\n5. Genetic bottleneck and inbreeding depression:\n- A single-founder scenario entails a bottleneck and potential inbreeding depression. However, these factors do not prevent the immediate production of seeds in a self-compatible species; they may reduce fitness components but do not force $E[\\text{seeds} \\mid G]$ to zero. In contrast, self-incompatibility in Species F imposes a strict barrier to any seed production with only one individual.\n\n6. Conclusion:\n- Species G can establish by self-fertilization and produce seeds immediately.\n- Species F cannot produce seeds immediately due to the self-incompatibility requirement for genetically distinct pollen.\n\nTherefore, the best prediction is that Species G can establish via selfing, whereas Species F fails to reproduce due to self-incompatibility, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1736614"}, {"introduction": "Beyond immediate ecological impacts, climate change imposes powerful selective pressures that can drive rapid evolution. This becomes particularly complex for species expanding their range into novel environments where historical environmental cues may become decoupled. This advanced practice explores such a scenario, modeling the evolutionary challenge for a plant moving to higher latitudes where the timing of spring warmth ($t_T$) has shifted relative to the day-length cycle ($t_L$). You will determine an evolutionarily optimal strategy, represented by a weighting parameter $\\alpha$, for integrating these conflicting cues to achieve maximum reproductive fitness. This exercise brilliantly synthesizes concepts of phenology, stabilizing selection, and local adaptation, providing insight into the genetic adjustments species may undergo in response to global change. [@problem_id:1736583]", "problem": "A species of perennial plant, *Silene borealis*, is expanding its range poleward in response to a warming climate. Its reproductive success is critically dependent on the timing of its flowering, known as phenology. In its new, higher-latitude expansion range, the plant faces a novel combination of temperature and day-length cues.\n\nThe flowering time, $t_{flower}$, measured in days after the vernal equinox, is determined by a genetically controlled mechanism that integrates information from two independent pathways: a thermal pathway and a photoperiodic pathway. The relative influence of these two pathways is governed by a single, continuously variable trait, the weighting parameter $\\alpha$, where $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1$. The resulting flowering time is a linear combination:\n$$t_{flower}(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\cdot t_{T} + (1-\\alpha) \\cdot t_{L}$$\nHere, $t_T$ is the flowering time that would be induced by the thermal pathway alone, and $t_L$ is the flowering time that would be induced by the photoperiodic pathway alone.\n\nField observations and controlled-environment studies for the population in the new expansion range have established the following parameters:\n- The thermal cue, based on accumulated warmth, would trigger flowering at $t_{T} = 35$ days.\n- The photoperiodic cue, based on critical day-length, would trigger flowering at $t_{L} = 65$ days.\n\nEcological analysis has shown that the reproductive fitness, $W$, of an individual plant is maximized at an optimal flowering time, $t_{opt}$. Fitness declines for plants flowering either earlier or later than this optimum. The fitness function is well-approximated by a Gaussian model:\n$$W(t_{flower}) = \\exp\\left( -k (t_{flower} - t_{opt})^2 \\right)$$\nwhere $k$ is a positive constant representing the strength of stabilizing selection, and the optimal flowering time in the new range is $t_{opt} = 55$ days.\n\nAssuming that natural selection will favor the genotype that confers the highest possible fitness in this new environment, determine the evolutionarily optimal value of the weighting parameter, $\\alpha_{opt}$.", "solution": "The flowering time as a function of the weighting parameter is given by\n$$t_{flower}(\\alpha) = \\alpha t_{T} + (1-\\alpha) t_{L} = t_{L} + \\alpha\\left(t_{T} - t_{L}\\right).$$\nFitness is\n$$W(t_{flower}) = \\exp\\left(-k\\left(t_{flower} - t_{opt}\\right)^{2}\\right),$$\nwith $k>0$.
