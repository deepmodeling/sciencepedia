A foundational skill is the ability to apply its rules to predict the outcome of genetic alterations.

According to this model, the identity of organs developing in four concentric whorls (numbered 1 to 4 from outermost to innermost) is determined by the combinatorial expression of three classes of genes (A, B, and C).\n\nIn a wild-type flower, the gene expression and resulting organ identity are as follows:\n*   **Whorl 1**: A-class gene expression alone determines **sepal** identity.\n*   **Whorl 2**: Co-expression of A-class and B-class genes determines **petal** identity.\n*   **Whorl 3**: Co-expression of B-class and C-class genes determines **stamen** identity.\n*   **Whorl 4**: C-class gene expression alone determines **carpel** identity.\n\nA key regulatory principle of the model is that A-class and C-class gene activities are mutually antagonistic; the presence of A-class function represses C-class gene expression, and vice-versa. In a wild-type flower, this confines A-class activity to whorls 1 and 2, and C-class activity to whorls 3 and 4.\n\nImagine a genetic engineering experiment where a researcher successfully introduces a construct that causes the constitutive expression of an A-class gene throughout the entire floral meristem. As a result, A-class gene function is ectopically present in all four whorls (1, 2, 3, and 4), while the expression patterns of B-class and C-class genes remain under their normal control.\n\nBased on the rules of the ABC model, predict the sequence of floral organs from the outermost whorl to the innermost whorl (Whorl 1, Whorl 2, Whorl 3, Whorl 4) in this transgenic plant.\n\nA.

The B-class dosage sensitivity is whorl-specific: petals form in whorl 2 only if B exceeds 0.6 of wild type, and stamens form in whorl 3 only if B exceeds 0.35 of wild type.

The wild-type version of this plant has a standard flower structure of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Two competing hypotheses are proposed to explain the all-carpel mutant phenotype:\n\n**Hypothesis I:** The phenotype is caused by simultaneous recessive loss-of-function mutations in both a Class A gene and a Class B gene.\n**Hypothesis II:** The phenotype is caused by a single, dominant gain-of-function allele of the Class C gene, which leads to its expression in all four whorls and simultaneously represses the function of both Class A and Class B genes.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, a researcher performs a cross between a true-breeding all-carpel mutant and a true-breeding wild-type plant. Assuming standard Mendelian inheritance where wild-type alleles are dominant over loss-of-function alleles, which of the following outcomes for the F1 generation would provide definitive support for Hypothesis I?\n\nA.

The F1 generation will consist of a 1:1 phenotypic ratio of wild-type to all-carpel plants, indicating codominance.\n\nE. All F1 plants will exhibit a floral phenotype of Carpel-Stamen-Stamen-Carpel, the classic phenotype for ectopic C-gene expression.", "solution": "We formalize the ABC model genetics and the two hypotheses using standard Mendelian notation. Let $A,a$ denote functional and loss-of-function alleles of the Class A gene, $B,b$ the corresponding alleles of the Class B gene, and $C,c$ for the Class C gene. Wild-type alleles $A,B,C$ are dominant over their recessive loss-of-function counterparts $a,b,c$.\n\nBy the ABC model and mutual antagonism:\n- Whorl 1: $A$ alone specifies sepals; $C$ is repressed where $A$ is expressed.\n- Whorl 2: $A+B$ specifies petals; $C$ is repressed where $A$ is expressed.\n- Whorl 3: $B+C$ specifies stamens.\n- Whorl 4: $C$ alone specifies carpels.\nMoreover, in the absence of $A$ function, $C$ expands into whorls 1 and 2 and, where $C$ is expressed, it represses $A$.\n\nWe analyze the genotypes and F1 predictions under each hypothesis for a cross between a true-breeding all-carpel mutant and a true-breeding wild-type.\n\nStep 1: Genotype under Hypothesis I (simultaneous recessive loss-of-function in Class A and Class B).\n- A true-breeding all-carpel mutant consistent with this hypothesis has genotype $aa\\,bb\\,CC$. The necessity of carpels in all whorls implies functional $C$; true-breeding implies homozygosity, so take $CC$.\n- A true-breeding wild type is $AA\\,BB\\,CC$.\n\nStep 2: F1 genotype and phenotype under Hypothesis I.\n- Cross: ($aa\\,bb\\,CC$) $\\times$ ($AA\\,BB\\,CC$) $\\to$ F1: $Aa\\,Bb\\,CC$.\n- Because wild-type alleles are dominant, $A$ and $B$ functions are present in the F1 ($A\\_$ and $B\\_$).\n- Antagonism restricts $C$ where $A$ is expressed: $C$ is repressed in whorls 1 and 2, restoring the canonical ABC pattern:\n  - Whorl 1: $A$ alone $\\Rightarrow$ sepals.\n  - Whorl 2: $A+B$ $\\Rightarrow$ petals.\n  - Whorl 3: $B+C$ $\\Rightarrow$ stamens.\n  - Whorl 4: $C$ alone $\\Rightarrow$ carpels.\nThus, all F1 exhibit wild-type flowers. This outcome is the hallmark of genetic complementation of recessive mutations in different genes and provides definitive support for Hypothesis I.\n\nStep 3: Exclusion of alternatives for Hypothesis I.\n- Option B (all F1 all-carpel) would require a dominant effect in the F1, contradicting the recessive-loss hypothesis; it supports a dominant gain-of-function in $C$.\n- Option C (Sepal-Sepal-Carpel-Carpel) would imply only $B$ remained mutant in F1 (i.e., $A$ complemented but $B$ not), which cannot occur when crossing $aa\\,bb$ to $AA\\,BB$; both $A$ and $B$ are complemented in all F1.\n- Option D (1:1 ratio) cannot arise from a cross of two true-breeding homozygotes; such a ratio requires a different cross (e.g., heterozygote testcross).\n- Option E (Carpel-Stamen-Stamen-Carpel) is the classic phenotype of ectopic $C$ in whorls 1 and 2 with $B$ intact in whorl 2, consistent with a dominant $C$ gain-of-function, not with recessive $A$ and $B$ loss.\n\nTherefore, the F1 outcome that definitively supports Hypothesis I is that all F1 are wild type due to complementation.\n\nConclusion: The correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1778211"}]}
