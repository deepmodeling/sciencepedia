This problem [@problem_id:1746271] explores one of the key mechanisms: differential DNA methylation. By analyzing a hypothetical gene's expression pattern, you will practice the fundamental skill of inferring biological function from epigenetic regulation, connecting molecular data to organism-level traits.", "problem": "In many eukaryotes, gene expression is regulated by epigenetic modifications, which do not alter the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequence itself. One common modification is DNA methylation, where the addition of methyl groups to a gene's promoter region typically leads to transcriptional silencing, effectively turning the gene \"off\".\n\nA molecular biologist is investigating gene regulation in a model plant species. They focus on a gene named *FLOR1*. Their research reveals that the promoter of the *FLOR1* gene is heavily methylated in root cells, and consequently, the gene is not transcribed in these cells. Conversely, in the cells of the flower's petals, the *FLOR1* promoter is found to be unmethylated, and the gene is actively transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA).\n\nBased solely on this pattern of differential gene expression, which of the following describes the most probable function of the protein encoded by the *FLOR1* gene?\n\nA. Facilitating the transport of water and minerals through the plant's vascular tissue.\nB. Synthesizing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) through glycolysis in the cytoplasm.\nC. Producing a volatile organic compound that functions to attract pollinators.\nD. Repairing DNA damage from various mutagens in all living tissues of the plant.\nE. It is fundamentally impossible to infer any aspect of a gene's function from its expression pattern.", "solution": "Principle: Epigenetic DNA methylation at a geneâ€™s promoter typically represses transcription; an unmethylated promoter permits transcription. Therefore, promoter methylation status correlates inversely with gene expression.\n\nGiven observations: In root cells, the *FLOR1* promoter is heavily methylated and the gene is not transcribed; in petal cells, the promoter is unmethylated and the gene is actively transcribed into mRNA. Thus, *FLOR1* exhibits tissue-specific expression: off in roots, on in petals.\n\nInference: A gene that is silenced in roots but active in petals most likely encodes a function required in petals, not a housekeeping or ubiquitous function. Housekeeping functions (e.g., glycolysis, DNA repair, core transport in vascular tissues) are generally required in most or all living cells and therefore are typically expressed broadly and constitutively, not restricted to petals via promoter methylation.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A. Facilitating transport of water and minerals through vascular tissue is a ubiquitous function involving xylem/phloem throughout the plant, including roots and stems. This should not be restricted to petals; inconsistent with petal-specific expression.\n- B. ATP synthesis via glycolysis is a core metabolic pathway required in nearly all cells, including roots; inconsistent with repression in roots.\n- C. Producing a volatile organic compound to attract pollinators is a classic petal-associated function, often enriched in floral tissues where scent is produced; consistent with expression in petals and repression in non-floral tissues like roots.\n- D. DNA repair is essential in all living tissues; such genes are typically broadly expressed; inconsistent with silencing in roots.\n- E. It is not fundamentally impossible to infer function from expression; tissue-specific expression patterns are routinely used to hypothesize gene function.\n\nConclusion: The observed petal-specific expression pattern most strongly supports a role in producing compounds for pollinator attraction.\n\nTherefore, the most probable function is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1746271"}, {"introduction": "The principles of epigenetic inheritance are not universally applied across the tree of life. This exercise [@problem_id:1746264] presents a comparative thought experiment, challenging you to predict the consequences of a specific genetic mutation in both a plant and an animal. Solving it requires contrasting the distinct strategies of germline development and epigenetic reprogramming between these two major kingdoms, revealing the elegant diversity of biological solutions to maintaining genome integrity.", "problem": "In both plants and animals, the activity of mobile genetic elements known as transposons is typically suppressed by epigenetic mechanisms to ensure genome stability. A key pathway for this suppression is RNA interference (RNAi), where an enzyme called Dicer plays a crucial role. Dicer cleaves double-stranded RNA precursors into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which then guide protein complexes to silence transposon expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment in two model organisms: the thale cress, *Arabidopsis thaliana* (a plant), and the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster* (an animal). In each species, a homozygous recessive mutation completely inactivates the primary Dicer enzyme responsible for transposon-derived siRNA production. A female homozygous for this mutation is crossed with a wild-type male who has two functional copies of the Dicer gene. All resulting F1 progeny are therefore heterozygous for the Dicer allele.\n\nBased on the fundamental differences in germline development and epigenetic inheritance between plants and animals, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome for transposon activity in the F1 progeny of these crosses?\n\nA. Transposon silencing will be largely maintained in the *Arabidopsis* F1 progeny but will be significantly compromised in the *Drosophila* F1 progeny.\nB. Transposon silencing will be fully restored in the F1 progeny of both species because the presence of one wild-type Dicer allele is sufficient for normal silencing.\nC. Transposon silencing will be significantly compromised in the F1 progeny of both species because the maternal contribution of the mutant allele disrupts silencing establishment.\nD. Transposon silencing will be significantly compromised in the *Arabidopsis* F1 progeny but will be largely maintained in the *Drosophila* F1 progeny.\nE. Transposon activity will not change in the F1 progeny of either species, as epigenetic silencing patterns are always completely reset between generations.", "solution": "Define parental genotypes and inheritance. Let the mutant Dicer allele be $d$ and the wild-type allele be $D$. The female parent is $dd$ (homozygous mutant) and the male parent is $DD$ (homozygous wild-type). All F1 progeny are $Dd$ (heterozygous). Because the maternal parent is $dd$, there is no maternal production or deposition of Dicer-dependent siRNAs into the egg.\n\nState fundamental principles about small-RNA-based transposon silencing and epigenetic inheritance in the two lineages.\n- In animals such as Drosophila, small-RNA-mediated transposon silencing in early embryos and the germline relies critically on maternally deposited small RNAs and effector proteins; the germline is set aside early, and there is extensive epigenetic reprogramming. Zygotic transcription and restoration of silencing components occur after early embryonic stages in which transposons can become active if maternal small RNAs are absent. Consequently, a maternal-effect requirement exists: even if the zygote is $Dd$, the absence of maternally provided Dicer-dependent siRNAs compromises the establishment of silencing in the F1.\n- In plants such as Arabidopsis, there is no global erasure of DNA methylation between generations; CG and CHG methylation are maintained through gametogenesis and after fertilization by maintenance methyltransferases, while CHH methylation and de novo DNA methylation are guided by siRNAs (RNA-directed DNA methylation). Silencing at many transposons is preserved by maintenance methylation independent of immediate maternal siRNA supply, and zygotic expression of a single $D$ allele can regenerate siRNAs. Thus, even when the mother is $dd$, inherited DNA methylation marks on transposons are largely preserved and can be reinforced post-fertilization in the $Dd$ embryo.\n\nPredict outcomes for each cross using these principles.\n- Drosophila cross ($dd \\times DD \\rightarrow Dd$): The $dd$ mother cannot produce or deposit Dicer-dependent siRNAs into the oocyte. Early embryos lack maternal siRNAs, so the initiation of small-RNA-guided transposon silencing is impaired during the critical early window. Although the F1 is $Dd$ and will eventually express Dicer zygotically, this is temporally too late to fully prevent early transposon activation. Therefore, transposon silencing is significantly compromised in the F1.\n- Arabidopsis cross ($dd \\times DD \\rightarrow Dd$): Despite the maternal $dd$ genotype, transposon silencing is largely preserved because methylation marks (especially CG and CHG) are maintained across generations and are not globally reset. After fertilization, the $Dd$ zygote can produce siRNAs to sustain or reestablish RdDM where needed. Consequently, transposon silencing is largely maintained in the F1.\n\nEvaluate options.\n- Option A matches the predicted differential: largely maintained in Arabidopsis F1, significantly compromised in Drosophila F1.\n- Options B and E incorrectly assume complete restoration or complete reset across generations in both species.\n- Option C incorrectly predicts compromise in both species.\n- Option D inverts the expected lineage-specific outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1746264"}, {"introduction": "Epigenetic memory is rarely an all-or-nothing phenomenon; it can decay or be reinforced over time. This problem [@problem_id:1746285] moves beyond qualitative descriptions to build a quantitative model of epigenetic stability across cell divisions. By deriving and comparing mathematical expressions for inheritance probability, you will develop a more nuanced understanding of how passive dilution and active maintenance mechanisms contribute to the persistence of an epigenetic mark through generations.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the transgenerational effects of a rare environmental stressor on two model organisms: a simple invertebrate (Species A) and an annual plant (Species P). The stressor induces a specific DNA methylation pattern, or 'epigenetic mark', at a single genetic locus.\n\nIn Species A, which has a segregated germline, the mark is successfully induced in a single germline stem cell. This cell then undergoes $n$ synchronous rounds of mitosis to generate the population of gamete precursors. The inheritance of this epigenetic mark is imperfect. At each cell division, a daughter cell of a marked parent has a probability $p$ of correctly inheriting the mark. If a cell does not inherit the mark, it and all its descendants will remain unmarked.\n\nIn Species P, the epigenetic mark is induced in a single apical meristem cell. This cell and its descendants also undergo $n$ synchronous rounds of mitosis to form the tissue that will eventually produce gametes. The inheritance in Species P involves two processes. First, there is a passive inheritance step identical to that in Species A, where the mark is passed to a daughter cell with probability $p$. Second, if a daughter cell *fails* to inherit the mark passively (an event with probability $1-p$), an active maintenance mechanism specific to the plant has a probability $q$ of recognizing the locus and re-establishing the mark. This active reinforcement occurs immediately after the division and only acts on cells that would have otherwise become unmarked.\n\nLet $P_A(n)$ be the probability that a single descendant cell, chosen at random after $n$ divisions, carries the epigenetic mark in Species A. Let $P_P(n)$ be the corresponding probability for Species P. Assume the initial single cell in both cases is marked before the first division.\n\nDerive a concise, closed-form analytic expression for the ratio $R(n) = \\frac{P_P(n)}{P_A(n)}$ as a function of $n$, $p$, and $q$ for $n \\ge 1$.", "solution": "We model the probability that a randomly chosen descendant after $n$ synchronous divisions is marked by following a single random lineage from the initially marked cell through $n$ successive divisions. Due to symmetry and exchangeability among the $2^{n}$ descendants, the probability that a uniformly chosen terminal cell is marked equals the probability that the mark persists along a single ancestral path of length $n$. Moreover, once the mark is lost at any division along the lineage, all descendants on that path remain unmarked.\n\nSpecies A:\nLet $P_A(n)$ denote the probability a random descendant is marked after $n$ divisions, starting from a marked initial cell. At each division along the lineage, conditional on the parent being marked, the daughter inherits the mark with probability $p$. Therefore, the mark persists through $n$ consecutive divisions if and only if inheritance succeeds at all $n$ steps. This yields the recurrence\n$$\nP_A(n+1) = p\\,P_A(n), \\quad P_A(0)=1,\n$$\nwhose solution is\n$$\nP_A(n) = p^{n}.\n$$\n\nSpecies P:\nLet $P_P(n)$ denote the analogous probability for the plant. For a marked parent, the daughter ends marked after one division if either the passive step succeeds (probability $p$) or the passive step fails (probability $1-p$) but the active maintenance restores the mark (probability $q$). Thus the effective per-division transmission probability from a marked parent is\n$$\np+(1-p)q = 1 - (1-p)(1-q).\n$$\nAs loss remains irreversible (no acquisition from an unmarked parent), the lineage-level recurrence is\n$$\nP_P(n+1) = \\big(p+(1-p)q\\big)\\,P_P(n), \\quad P_P(0)=1,\n$$\ngiving\n$$\nP_P(n) = \\big(p+(1-p)q\\big)^{n}.\n$$\n\nRatio:\nTherefore, for $n \\ge 1$,\n$$\nR(n) = \\frac{P_P(n)}{P_A(n)} = \\left(\\frac{p+(1-p)q}{p}\\right)^{n}.\n$$\nThis expression also equals $\\left(1+\\frac{(1-p)q}{p}\\right)^{n}$ or $\\left(\\frac{1-(1-p)(1-q)}{p}\\right)^{n}$, all algebraically equivalent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{p+(1-p)q}{p}\\right)^{n}}$$", "id": "1746285"}]}
