This model posits that three classes of homeotic genes, known as MADS-box genes (named after the first four discovered: MCM1, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS, and SERUM RESPONSE FACTOR), work in a combinatorial manner to specify the development of the four concentric whorls of a typical flower.\n\nThe model is defined by the following rules:\n-   The four whorls are numbered 1 to 4, from outermost to innermost.\n-   **Whorl 1** (Sepals) develops where only **Class A** genes are expressed.\n-   **Whorl 2** (Petals) develops where **Class A** and **Class B** genes are expressed together.\n-   **Whorl 3** (Stamens) develops where **Class B** and **Class C** genes are expressed together.\n-   **Whorl 4** (Carpels) develops where only **Class C** genes are expressed.\n-   An additional rule states that Class A and Class C functions are mutually antagonistic: in their respective domains, they inhibit each other. Consequently, if a Class A gene has a loss-of-function mutation, Class C gene expression expands into whorls 1 and 2. Conversely, if a Class C gene has a loss-of-function mutation, Class A gene expression expands into whorls 3 and 4. Class B gene expression is not affected by this antagonism.\n\nA botanist studying a species of *Antirrhinum* (snapdragon) discovers a mutant plant. Upon dissecting its flowers, she observes the following pattern of organs from the outside in: the first whorl consists of sepals, the second whorl consists of petals, the third whorl also consists of petals, and the fourth and innermost whorl consists of sepals.\n\nBased on the ABC model as described, a loss-of-function mutation in which single class of genes is the most parsimonious explanation for this observed floral phenotype?\n\nA.

Loss of A allows C to expand outward into whorls 1 and 2. Loss of C allows A to expand inward into whorls 3 and 4. B is unaffected by A–C antagonism.\n\nObserved phenotype is, from outer to inner: whorl 1 sepals, whorl 2 petals, whorl 3 petals, whorl 4 sepals.\n\nTest Class C loss-of-function.

Predicted organs are whorl 1 C alone gives carpels, whorl 2 B with C gives stamens, whorl 3 B with C gives stamens, whorl 4 C alone gives carpels. This does not match.\n- Class B loss-of-function: B absent; A in whorls 1 and 2, C in whorls 3 and 4.

This does not match.\n- Simultaneous losses (options D or E) are not single-class mutations and also yield mismatching phenotypes: A and B loss gives carpels in all whorls; B and C loss gives sepals in all whorls.\n\nTherefore, the most parsimonious single-class loss-of-function explaining the observed phenotype is Class C genes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1754371"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the classic model, this problem introduces the crucial role of Class E genes and explores the developmental \"ground state\" of the flower. By considering a hypothetical scenario where all major floral identity genes are absent, you can uncover the evolutionary foundation of the ABC(E) model. This thought experiment reinforces the concept that all floral organs are modified leaves and demonstrates why E-class genes are considered master regulators of floral development. [@problem_id:1754420]", "problem": "In the study of plant developmental genetics, the ABC model provides a framework for understanding how floral organs are specified. This model is based on the expression of different classes of homeotic genes in four concentric whorls of a developing flower, numbered 1 (outermost) to 4 (innermost). The identity of the organ in each whorl is determined by a unique combination of these gene products. The model has since been updated to the ABC(E) model, incorporating a fourth class of genes, E, which are essential for the proper development of all floral organs.\n\nThe rules of the ABC(E) model for a typical eudicot flower are as follows:\n- **Whorl 1 (Sepals):** Expression of A-class + E-class genes.\n- **Whorl 2 (Petals):** Expression of A-class + B-class + E-class genes.\n- **Whorl 3 (Stamens):** Expression of B-class + C-class + E-class genes.\n- **Whorl 4 (Carpels):** Expression of C-class + E-class genes.\n\nA foundational concept in botany is that all floral organs are evolutionarily derived from modified leaves. This implies a \"ground state\" or default developmental pathway. In the absence of the specific combination of gene products that define a floral organ, the structure develops into this default state. The E-class genes are considered fundamental floral organ identity genes; their function is required for any of the A, B, or C class genes to specify organ identity.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered plant where a complete loss-of-function mutation has been induced in all A-class, all B-class, all C-class, and all E-class genes (a quadruple mutant). Assuming the plant is still able to initiate the flowering process and produce floral primordia, what would be the phenotype of the resulting structures that develop in place of the normal flowers?\n\nA. The structure would consist of four whorls of sepals.\n\nB. The structure would consist of four whorls of carpels.\n\nC. The structure would consist of four whorls of leaf-like structures.\n\nD.

A foundational botanical concept is that, in the absence of specific floral organ identity programs, the default developmental outcome is a leaf-like structure (the ground state), reflecting the evolutionary derivation of floral organs from leaves.\n\nIn the engineered quadruple mutant, all $A$-, $B$-, $C$-, and $E$-class gene functions are lost; symbolically, $A=B=C=E=0$. Evaluating each whorl:\n- Whorl 1 requires $A+E$, but $E=0$ (and $A=0$), so sepal identity cannot be specified.\n- Whorl 2 requires $A+B+E$, but $E=0$ (and $A=B=0$), so petal identity cannot be specified.\n- Whorl 3 requires $B+C+E$, but $E=0$ (and $B=C=0$), so stamen identity cannot be specified.\n- Whorl 4 requires $C+E$, but $E=0$ (and $C=0$), so carpel identity cannot be specified.\n\nBecause $E=0$ prevents any floral organ identity and no $A$, $B$, or $C$ inputs remain to drive alternative floral identities, all primordia follow the default ground state and develop as leaf-like organs (phyllody). The problem stipulates that flowering initiates and floral primordia form, so the apex will still produce organ primordia arranged in the typical whorled pattern, but each will be leaf-like rather than a floral organ.\n\nTherefore, the resulting structure consists of four whorls of leaf-like structures.\n\nChecking options:\n- A (four whorls of sepals) requires $A+E$; invalid since $E=0$.\n- B (four whorls of carpels) requires $C+E$; invalid since $E=0$.\n- C (four whorls of leaf-like structures) matches the default ground state when $A=B=C=E=0$.\n- D (indeterminate whorls of petal-like structures) requires $A+B+E$; invalid since $E=0$ and $A=B=0$.\n- E (no structures; growth terminates) contradicts the assumption that floral primordia are produced.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1754420"}, {"introduction": "Genetic models like the ABC(E) framework describe developmental logic, but they are ultimately driven by physical interactions between proteins. This practice delves into the molecular mechanisms, asking you to design a key experiment to test the protein-protein interactions predicted by the floral quartet model. By applying your knowledge to a common laboratory technique—the Yeast Two-Hybrid assay— you will bridge the gap from abstract genetic theory to concrete experimental validation. [@problem_id:1754429]", "problem": "A botanist is investigating the molecular basis of floral organ identity in a newly discovered plant species, *Virensis hypothetica*. They have identified four key MADS-box genes critical for flower development: `FLORA1` (F1), a Class A gene; `FLORA2` (F2), a Class B gene; `PISTON` (PS), another Class B gene; and `SEEDBOX` (SB), a Class C gene.\n\nAccording to the prevailing floral quartet model, the identity of a floral organ is determined by a specific tetrameric (four-protein) complex of these MADS-box transcription factors. The botanist hypothesizes that in *V. hypothetica*, the development of petals in the second floral whorl is specified by a quartet composed of two F1 proteins, one F2 protein, and one PS protein.\n\nTo begin testing this hypothesis, the botanist decides to investigate the necessary protein-protein interactions required for the assembly of this proposed quartet. They employ a Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) assay. In this system, one target protein is fused to a DNA-Binding Domain (BD) to act as 'bait', and a second target protein is fused to a transcriptional Activation Domain (AD) to act as 'prey'. If the bait and prey proteins physically interact, they bring the BD and AD into close proximity, reconstituting a functional transcription factor that activates a reporter gene. A positive result, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction, is observed as robust yeast cell growth on a selective medium.\n\nBased on the established principles of how floral MADS-box proteins, particularly those of Class B, are known to function, which one of the following Y2H experiments is most critically expected to yield a positive result if the botanist's hypothesis about the petal-specifying quartet is correct?\n\nA.

Bait: SB fused to BD, Prey: SB fused to AD", "solution": "The hypothesis states that petals (whorl 2) in Virensis hypothetica are specified by a quartet containing two Class A proteins (two F1) and two Class B proteins (one F2 and one PS). According to the floral quartet model and extensive data from model systems such as Arabidopsis, MADS-box proteins first form obligate dimers, and two dimers then associate on adjacent CArG-boxes to form a tetramer. Therefore, the tetramer’s feasibility depends on specific pairwise dimerization capabilities.\n\nA key, well-established principle for Class B MADS-box proteins is that the two canonical B partners (AP3-like and PI-like proteins) form an obligate heterodimer. They typically do not homodimerize detectably in standard assays like yeast two-hybrid. This obligate heterodimer is essential for their function in specifying petals and stamens and forms the B-class dimer that then associates with A-class proteins to specify petals. Translating to the present system, F2 and PS are the two Class B proteins, so their direct heterodimerization is a critical prerequisite for assembling the proposed petal quartet that contains one F2 and one PS together with two F1.\n\nA Y2H assay detects direct protein-protein interactions. Therefore, the most critically expected positive interaction, if the hypothesis is correct and consistent with known Class B behavior, is the heterodimer between the two B-class proteins, F2 and PS.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A (F2-F2) tests a B-class homodimer; B-class proteins generally do not homodimerize in Y2H, so this is not expected to be positive.\n- B (F1-SB) tests an A–C interaction; A and C functions are typically antagonistic and not known for a defining direct dimer in petal specification; this is not expected to be a required interaction for petals.\n- C (PS-PS) tests a B-class homodimer; as with A, this is generally not expected to be positive.\n- D (F2-PS) tests the B-class heterodimer; this is the canonical and essential interaction for petal identity complexes and is thus the most critically expected positive result.\n- E (SB-SB) tests a C-class homodimer; even if some C-class proteins can homodimerize, this is not critical for petal specification and does not test the central B–B heterodimer required by the hypothesis.\n\nHence, the most critically expected positive Y2H result is the heterodimer between the two B-class proteins, F2 and PS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1754429"}]}
