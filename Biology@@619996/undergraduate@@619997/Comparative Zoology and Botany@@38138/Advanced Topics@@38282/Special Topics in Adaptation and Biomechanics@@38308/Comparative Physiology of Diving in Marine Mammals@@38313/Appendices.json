The Aerobic Dive Limit (ADL), defined as the maximum dive duration sustained by aerobic metabolism, is given by the ratio of total usable oxygen stores ($O_{2,total}$) to the Diving Metabolic Rate (DMR).\n\nThe model is based on the following relationships for an individual seal of body mass $M_{body}$:\n1.
