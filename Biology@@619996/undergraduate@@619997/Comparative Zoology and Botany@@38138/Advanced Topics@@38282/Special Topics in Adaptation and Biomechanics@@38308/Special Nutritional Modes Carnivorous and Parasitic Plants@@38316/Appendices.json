This first practice challenges you to think like an experimental biologist. By analyzing a hypothetical experiment on the sundew *Drosera*, you will explore how scientists can distinguish between two competing hypotheses: digestion by the plant's own enzymes versus digestion by symbiotic bacteria. This exercise emphasizes the power of proper experimental design, particularly the critical role of controls in isolating variables and drawing valid scientific conclusions [@problem_id:1775673].", "problem": "A botanist is investigating the digestive mechanism of the Cape sundew, *Drosera capensis*. When an insect is trapped by the plant's sticky tentacles, it is slowly digested. Two primary hypotheses exist for this process: (1) the plant secretes its own digestive enzymes, or (2) the digestion is primarily carried out by a community of symbiotic bacteria living in the plant's mucilage.\n\nTo distinguish between these hypotheses, the botanist conducts an experiment on three groups of mature, healthy *Drosera* leaves. The antibiotic used, chloramphenicol, is known to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis but has been verified in separate tests to have no direct toxic or inhibitory effect on the plant's own cellular processes at the concentration used.\n\n- **Group A (Control):** Ten leaves are left untreated.\n- **Group B (Antibiotic Treatment):** Ten leaves are treated with a sterile solution of chloramphenicol.\n- **Group C (Vehicle Control):** Ten leaves are treated with a sterile water solution, the solvent used for the antibiotic.\n\nImmediately after treatment, a single, anaesthetized fruit fly of a standardized mass is placed on each leaf. After 72 hours, the remaining undigested portion of each fly is removed and weighed. The average percentage of biomass digested for each group is calculated and reported below:\n\n- **Group A:** 88% digested\n- **Group B:** 41% digested\n- **Group C:** 87% digested\n\nBased on these results, which of the following conclusions is the most scientifically valid?\n\nA. Digestion in *Drosera* is accomplished exclusively by the plant's own secreted enzymes.\n\nB. Digestion in *Drosera* is accomplished exclusively by symbiotic bacteria.\n\nC. Digestion in *Drosera* involves a significant contribution from both the plant's own enzymes and symbiotic bacteria.\n\nD. The chloramphenicol directly inhibited the plant's ability to secrete enzymes, invalidating the results.\n\nE. The physical application of a liquid solution, regardless of its contents, enhances the digestive process.", "solution": "We seek to infer the relative roles of plant-secreted enzymes and symbiotic bacteria in digestion by comparing digestion outcomes across controls and an antibiotic treatment that selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis without directly affecting plant processes at the tested concentration.\n\nLogical analysis of controls:\n- Group A (untreated) shows digestion fraction $0.88$.\n- Group C (vehicle control) shows digestion fraction $0.87$.\nThese nearly identical values indicate that the application of sterile water (the solvent) does not alter digestion relative to untreated leaves. Therefore, the physical application of liquid, per se, does not enhance digestion, which contradicts option E.\n\nEffect of antibiotic treatment:\n- Group B (chloramphenicol) shows digestion fraction $0.41$, a substantial reduction relative to Groups A and C.\nGiven that chloramphenicol inhibits bacterial protein synthesis and has been independently verified to have no direct inhibitory effect on the plant at the used concentration, the most parsimonious interpretation is that symbiotic bacteria normally contribute significantly to digestion. This reduction rules out option A (exclusively plant enzymes), because if digestion were exclusively plant-mediated, Group B should have resembled Group A/C rather than dropping to $0.41$.\n\nResidual digestion under antibiotic:\n- Despite bacterial inhibition, Group B still achieves $0.41$ digestion, which is far above zero. If bacteria alone accomplished digestion (option B), then blocking bacterial protein synthesis should have reduced digestion to near zero; the observed residual digestion implies a substantial plant-derived digestive capacity persists under bacterial inhibition. Thus, option B is ruled out.\n\nConsideration of direct antibiotic effects on the plant:\n- Option D posits that chloramphenicol directly inhibited plant enzyme secretion. This is explicitly contradicted by the experimental verification provided: at the concentration used, chloramphenicol has no direct toxic or inhibitory effect on plant cellular processes. The proper vehicle control further ensures that any effect is not due to the solvent. Therefore, option D is invalid.\n\nSynthesis:\n- The large decrease from approximately $0.88$ to approximately $0.41$ with bacterial inhibition indicates an important bacterial contribution under normal conditions.\n- The substantial digestion remaining at $0.41$ under antibiotic indicates an important plant enzymatic contribution independent of bacteria.\nTogether, these observations support the conclusion that digestion in Drosera involves significant contributions from both plant enzymes and symbiotic bacteria.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically valid conclusion is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1775673"}, {"introduction": "While many carnivorous plants share the goal of digesting prey, evolution has produced diverse biochemical solutions to this challenge. This problem moves from a single species to a comparative analysis across three distinct genera: *Nepenthes*, *Sarracenia*, and *Drosera*. You will act as a comparative biochemist, interpreting data on how the activity of digestive enzymes changes with pH. Your task is to match the unique pH profile of each plant to a hypothesis about its dominant class of protease, providing insight into how these plants have adapted to the specific chemical environments of their traps [@problem_id:1775676].", "problem": "A comparative biochemist is investigating the digestive strategies of three genera of carnivorous plants: *Nepenthes*, *Sarracenia*, and *Drosera*. The primary mechanism for digesting captured prey involves the secretion of proteases into a digestive fluid. The scientist hypothesizes that the dominant class of protease in each genus has evolved to function optimally in the specific chemical environment of its digestive trap. The scientist prepares a standardized protein substrate and measures the relative rate of its digestion by fluid collected from each plant across a range of pH values. The results of the experiment are summarized as follows:\n\n-   **Fluid from *Nepenthes***: The protease activity is negligible below pH 1.5 and above pH 4.0. The activity increases sharply from pH 1.5 to a distinct maximum at pH 2.5, then decreases rapidly. At pH 3.5, the activity is approximately 50% of the maximum.\n-   **Fluid from *Sarracenia***: The protease activity is observed between pH 3.0 and pH 6.5. The activity curve is broad, showing a peak reaction rate at a pH of approximately 4.5. At pH 3.5 and pH 5.5, the activity is roughly 70% of the maximum.\n-   **Fluid from *Drosera***: The protease activity is most prominent in a narrow range. It is first detected at pH 5.0, rises to a sharp maximum at pH 6.0, and becomes undetectable above pH 7.0.\n\nThe scientist considers three-leading hypotheses for the dominant protease complements in these genera, based on known enzyme families:\n-   **Hypothesis I**: The fluid is dominated by pepsin-like aspartic proteases, which are known to function optimally in highly acidic environments (pH < 3.5).\n-   **Hypothesis II**: The fluid is dominated by a class of cysteine or serine proteases that exhibit maximal activity in slightly acidic to neutral conditions (pH 5.5 - 7.0).\n-   **Hypothesis III**: The fluid is dominated by a distinct group of acid proteases that function optimally in moderately acidic conditions (pH 4.0 - 5.0).\n\nBased on the experimental data, determine the most plausible match between each plant genus and one of the three hypotheses.\n\nA. *Nepenthes* - I, *Sarracenia* - II, *Drosera* - III\n\nB. *Nepenthes* - I, *Sarracenia* - III, *Drosera* - II\n\nC. *Nepenthes* - II, *Sarracenia* - I, *Drosera* - III\n\nD. *Nepenthes* - III, *Sarracenia* - I, *Drosera* - II\n\nE. *Nepenthes* - II, *Sarracenia* - III, *Drosera* - I", "solution": "The goal is to match each plant genus (*Nepenthes*, *Sarracenia*, *Drosera*) to the most fitting hypothesis (I, II, or III) based on the pH profile of their digestive protease activity.

The active range is highly acidic, from pH 1.5 to 4.0. We need to compare this optimal pH of 2.5 to the three hypotheses.\n-   Hypothesis I describes proteases optimal at pH < 3.5. An optimum of 2.5 falls squarely within this range.\n-   Hypothesis II describes proteases optimal at pH 5.5 - 7.0. A pH of 2.5 is far outside this range.\n-   Hypothesis III describes proteases optimal at pH 4.0 - 5.0. A pH of 2.5 is outside this range.\nTherefore, the data for *Nepenthes* strongly supports Hypothesis I.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the data for *Sarracenia*.\nThe problem states that the digestive fluid from *Sarracenia* has a peak reaction rate at a pH of approximately 4.5. The active range is between pH 3.0 and 6.5. We compare this optimal pH of 4.5 to the three hypotheses.\n-   Hypothesis I describes proteases optimal at pH < 3.5. A pH of 4.5 is outside this range.\n-   Hypothesis II describes proteases optimal at pH 5.5 - 7.0. A pH of 4.5 is outside this range.\n-   Hypothesis III describes proteases optimal at pH 4.0 - 5.0. An optimum of 4.5 is directly in the middle of this range.\nTherefore, the data for *Sarracenia* strongly supports Hypothesis III.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the data for *Drosera*.\nThe problem states that the digestive fluid from *Drosera* exhibits maximum protease activity at a pH of 6.0. The active range is narrow, from pH 5.0 to 7.0. We compare this optimal pH of 6.0 to the three hypotheses.\n-   Hypothesis I describes proteases optimal at pH < 3.5. A pH of 6.0 is far outside this range.\n-   Hypothesis II describes proteases optimal at pH 5.5 - 7.0.
