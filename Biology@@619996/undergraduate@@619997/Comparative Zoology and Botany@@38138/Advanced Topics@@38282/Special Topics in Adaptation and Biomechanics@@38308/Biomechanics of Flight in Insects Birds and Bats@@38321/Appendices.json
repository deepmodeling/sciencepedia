Animals must constantly adjust their aerodynamic forces, primarily lift, to maneuver. This practice delves into the practical application of the lift equation, $L = \\frac{1}{2} C_L \\rho S v^2$, showing how a bird preparing to land must strategically change its wing area ($S$) and angle of attack (related to $C_L$) to compensate for a necessary reduction in speed ($v$) [@problem_id:1734386].", "problem": "A bird in flight must constantly adjust its wings to control the aerodynamic forces acting upon it. The primary upward force, lift, is described by the equation $L = \\frac{1}{2} C_L \\rho S v^2$, where $L$ is the lift force, $C_L$ is the dimensionless lift coefficient (which depends on the wing's shape and its angle relative to the air), $\\rho$ is the density of the air, $S$ is the effective surface area of the wings, and $v$ is the bird's speed relative to the air.\n\nConsider a large raptor in steady, level flight.
