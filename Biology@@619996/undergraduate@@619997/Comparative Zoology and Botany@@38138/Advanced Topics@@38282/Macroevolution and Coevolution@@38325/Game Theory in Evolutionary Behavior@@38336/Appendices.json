Consider a simplified model of two symbiotic gut microbes, which we will call Microbe 1 and Microbe 2. They live as a pair and depend on a specific digestive enzyme to process nutrients. Each microbe has two possible strategies: 'Produce', where it synthesizes the enzyme, or 'Free-ride', where it does not.\n\nThe rules for fitness payoffs are as follows:\n- Producing the enzyme incurs a fitness cost of $c$ to the individual producer.\n- The enzyme is a \"public good.\" When one unit of the enzyme is produced by either microbe, both microbes in the pair experience a fitness benefit of $b$.\n- The benefits are additive. If both microbes choose 'Produce', two units of the enzyme are created, and each microbe receives a total fitness benefit of $2b$.\n- The interaction is a social dilemma, characterized by the condition $b < c < 2b$.\n\nYour task is to determine the fitness payoff for Microbe 1 for all four possible combinations of strategies. Present your answer as a single row matrix containing the four payoffs. The payoffs must be ordered corresponding to the following scenarios:\n1.  Microbe 1 chooses 'Produce', Microbe 2 chooses 'Produce'.\n2.  Microbe 1 chooses 'Produce', Microbe 2 chooses 'Free-ride'.\n3.  Microbe 1 chooses 'Free-ride', Microbe 2 chooses 'Produce'.\n4.  Microbe 1 chooses 'Free-ride', Microbe 2 chooses 'Free-ride'.\n\nExpress the payoffs in terms of $b$ and $c$.", "solution": "Each microbe’s fitness payoff equals the total benefit it receives from the enzyme units available to the pair minus any production cost it personally incurs. By the rules:\n- Producing incurs a cost $c$ to the producer.\n- Each unit of enzyme confers a benefit $b$ to each microbe.\n- If $n$ microbes produce, then $n$ units are created and each microbe receives total benefit $nb$.\n- Microbe 1’s payoff is therefore $nb$ minus $c$ if it produces, and $nb$ with no subtraction if it does not.\n\nCompute Microbe 1’s payoff in each scenario:\n1.

Often, the best strategy depends on what others are doing, leading to the stable coexistence of multiple behaviors. This practice problem [@problem_id:1748810] models a classic foraging conflict as a \"Hawk-Dove\" game, where you will calculate the equilibrium frequency of \"aggressive\" and \"passive\" foragers, demonstrating a core concept known as a mixed-strategy Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS).", "problem": "In a simplified ecological model, two desert foxes must independently decide where to forage for the night. They each have two choices: go to a single, large Oasis or to the surrounding sparse Scrubland, which contains numerous isolated foraging patches.\n\nThe total energy gain from the Oasis is a constant $H$. The energy gain from a single patch in the Scrubland is a constant $L$. The following rules determine the energy payoff for each fox:\n1.  If both foxes choose the Scrubland, they forage in separate patches, and each gains $L$ units of energy.\n2.  If one fox chooses the Oasis and the other chooses the Scrubland, the fox at the Oasis obtains all its resources, gaining $H$ energy, while the fox in the Scrubland gains $L$ energy.\n3.  If both foxes choose the Oasis, they must compete. They divide the resources equally, but the conflict itself costs each fox an amount of energy $c$. Thus, each fox's net energy gain is $H/2 - c$.\n\nThe scenario is interesting when the Oasis is richer than a scrubland patch ($H > L$), but sharing the Oasis is less profitable than having a scrubland patch to oneself ($H/2 - c  L$). Assume these conditions hold. In a large population of such foxes where individuals are randomly paired for this foraging game, the population can evolve to a stable state where both strategies (choosing the Oasis and choosing the Scrubland) coexist.\n\nDetermine the equilibrium fraction of the fox population that chooses to forage at the Oasis. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $H$, $L$, and $c$.", "solution": "This problem can be analyzed using the framework of evolutionary game theory. We have two players (the foxes) and two strategies: \"Oasis\" and \"Scrubland\". We first need to construct the payoff matrix, which represents the energy gain for Player 1 (row player) given the strategy of Player 2 (column player).\n\nLet's denote the payoff to a player as `Payoff(Strategy1, Strategy2)`, where `Strategy1` is the player's own strategy and `Strategy2` is the opponent's strategy.\n\nFrom the problem description:\n- If Player 1 chooses \"Oasis\" and Player 2 also chooses \"Oasis\", the payoff is $H/2 - c$. So, `Payoff(Oasis, Oasis)` is $H/2 - c$.\n- If Player 1 chooses \"Oasis\" and Player 2 chooses \"Scrubland\", the payoff is $H$. So, `Payoff(Oasis, Scrubland)` is $H$.\n- If Player 1 chooses \"Scrubland\" and Player 2 chooses \"Oasis\", the payoff is $L$. So, `Payoff(Scrubland, Oasis)` is $L$.\n- If Player 1 chooses \"Scrubland\" and Player 2 also chooses \"Scrubland\", the payoff is $L$. So, `Payoff(Scrubland, Scrubland)` is $L$.\n\nWe can summarize this in a payoff matrix for Player 1:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n\\text{Player 1}  \\text{Player 2: Oasis}  \\text{Player 2: Scrubland} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Oasis}  H/2 - c  H \\\\\n\\text{Scrubland}  L  L \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that an evolutionarily stable mixed-strategy equilibrium exists where both strategies coexist. This occurs when the expected payoff (or fitness) for an individual choosing the \"Oasis\" strategy is equal to the expected payoff for an individual choosing the \"Scrubland\" strategy.\n\nLet $p$ be the fraction of the population that plays \"Oasis\". Consequently, the fraction of the population that plays \"Scrubland\" is $1-p$.\n\nNow, we calculate the expected payoff for each strategy for an individual playing against a random member of this mixed-population.\n\nThe expected payoff for playing \"Oasis\", $E(\\text{Oasis})$, is the sum of the payoffs for playing against an \"Oasis\" player and a \"Scrubland\" player, weighted by their respective frequencies in the population:\n$$ E(\\text{Oasis}) = p \\cdot \\text{Payoff(Oasis, Oasis)} + (1-p) \\cdot \\text{Payoff(Oasis, Scrubland)} $$\nSubstituting the payoff values:\n$$ E(\\text{Oasis}) = p \\left(\\frac{H}{2} - c\\right) + (1-p)H $$\n\nThe expected payoff for playing \"Scrubland\", $E(\\text{Scrubland})$, is similarly calculated:\n$$ E(\\text{Scrubland}) = p \\cdot \\text{Payoff(Scrubland, Oasis)} + (1-p) \\cdot \\text{Payoff(Scrubland, Scrubland)} $$\nSubstituting the payoff values:\n$$ E(\\text{Scrubland}) = p \\cdot L + (1-p)L $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ E(\\text{Scrubland}) = L(p + 1 - p) = L $$\n\nAt equilibrium, the expected payoffs must be equal: $E(\\text{Oasis}) = E(\\text{Scrubland})$.\n$$ p \\left(\\frac{H}{2} - c\\right) + (1-p)H = L $$\n\nNow, we solve for $p$:\n$$ p \\frac{H}{2} - pc + H - pH = L $$\nRearrange the equation to isolate terms with $p$:\n$$ H - L = pH - p \\frac{H}{2} + pc $$\nFactor out $p$ from the right-hand side:\n$$ H - L = p \\left(H - \\frac{H}{2} + c\\right) $$\n$$ H - L = p \\left(\\frac{H}{2} + c\\right) $$\n\nFinally, we solve for $p$, which is the equilibrium fraction of the population choosing \"Oasis\":\n$$ p = \\frac{H - L}{\\frac{H}{2} + c} $$\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n$$ p = \\frac{2(H - L)}{H + 2c} $$\n\nThe conditions given in the problem, $H > L$ and $L > H/2 - c$, ensure that $p$ is a valid fraction between 0 and 1. $H > L$ ensures the numerator is positive. $L > H/2 - c$ is equivalent to $c > H/2 - L$. Let's check the condition $p  1$:\n$2(H-L)  H+2c$\n$2H - 2L  H + 2c$\n$H - 2L  2c$\n$H/2 - L  c$, which is equivalent to the given condition $L > H/2 - c$.
