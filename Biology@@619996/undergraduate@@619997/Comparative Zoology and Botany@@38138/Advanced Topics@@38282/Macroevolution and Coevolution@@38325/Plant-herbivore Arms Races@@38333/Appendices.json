This exercise applies the principles of Optimal Defense Theory, which treats defense as an economic decision where resources are allocated to maximize overall fitness. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario, you will calculate the expected fitness outcomes of different defense strategies, learning to evaluate the trade-offs between a tissue's value, its vulnerability to herbivores, and the metabolic cost of protecting it [@problem_id:1768178].", "problem": "A botanist is studying a hypothetical plant species, *Solanum aenigma*, to understand its resource allocation strategies against herbivores. The plant's overall fitness is the sum of the fitness contributions from its various tissues. The botanist develops a model based on the following parameters:\n\n1.  **Fitness Contribution (V)**: The value of a tissue to the plant's overall fitness if it is not damaged.\n    *   Young Leaves: $V_{YL} = 120$ fitness units\n    *   Old Leaves: $V_{OL} = 30$ fitness units\n    *   Roots: $V_{R} = 90$ fitness units\n\n2.  **Probability of Destruction (P)**: The probability that a tissue will be completely destroyed by herbivores during its lifespan if it is undefended.\n    *   Young Leaves: $P_{YL} = 0.60$\n    *   Old Leaves: $P_{OL} = 0.20$\n    *   Roots: $P_{R} = 0.40$\n\n3.  **Cost of Defense (C)**: The plant can produce a chemical defense that makes a tissue unpalatable, reducing its probability of destruction to zero. The metabolic cost of this defense is a fixed value subtracted from that tissue's fitness contribution. The cost is $C = 25$ fitness units for any tissue type.\n\nDue to limited resources, the plant can only allocate enough energy to fully defend **one** of the three tissue types (Young Leaves, Old Leaves, or Roots). Assuming the plant evolves to maximize its total expected fitness, which of the following strategies is optimal?\n\nA. Defend the young leaves.\n\nB. Defend the old leaves.\n\nC. Defend the roots.\n\nD. Defend no tissues, as the cost of defense is always greater than the expected loss from herbivory.\n\nE. Defend both young leaves and roots simultaneously.", "solution": "Let tissues be indexed by $i \\in \\{\\text{YL}, \\text{OL}, \\text{R}\\}$ with fitness contribution $V_{i}$ and probability of destruction if undefended $P_{i}$. If tissue $i$ is undefended, its expected contribution is\n$$\nE_{i}^{\\text{undef}}=(1-P_{i})V_{i}.\n$$\nIf tissue $i$ is defended, destruction probability is reduced to zero but incurs a metabolic cost $C$, so the expected contribution is\n$$\nE_{i}^{\\text{def}}=V_{i}-C.\n$$\nThe plant can defend at most one tissue, so the total expected fitness under a strategy that defends tissue $j$ is\n$$\nE^{\\text{total}}(j)=\\sum_{i \\neq j}(1-P_{i})V_{i}+(V_{j}-C).\n$$\nThe parameters are $V_{YL}=120$, $P_{YL}=0.60$; $V_{OL}=30$, $P_{OL}=0.20$; $V_{R}=90$, $P_{R}=0.40$; and $C=25$.\n\nFirst compute the expected contributions if no tissue is defended:\n$$\nE_{YL}^{\\text{undef}}=(1-0.60)\\cdot 120=0.40\\cdot 120=48,\n$$\n$$\nE_{OL}^{\\text{undef}}=(1-0.20)\\cdot 30=0.80\\cdot 30=24,\n$$\n$$\nE_{R}^{\\text{undef}}=(1-0.40)\\cdot 90=0.60\\cdot 90=54.\n$$\nThus the total with no defense is\n$$\nE^{\\text{total}}(\\text{none})=48+24+54=126.\n$$\n\nNow evaluate each allowed defense choice:\n\nDefend young leaves:\n$$\nE^{\\text{total}}(\\text{YL})=(V_{YL}-C)+E_{OL}^{\\text{undef}}+E_{R}^{\\text{undef}}=(120-25)+24+54=95+24+54=173.\n$$\n\nDefend old leaves:\n$$\nE^{\\text{total}}(\\text{OL})=(V_{OL}-C)+E_{YL}^{\\text{undef}}+E_{R}^{\\text{undef}}=(30-25)+48+54=5+48+54=107.\n$$\n\nDefend roots:\n$$\nE^{\\text{total}}(\\text{R})=(V_{R}-C)+E_{YL}^{\\text{undef}}+E_{OL}^{\\text{undef}}=(90-25)+48+24=65+48+24=137.\n$$\n\nCompare totals: $E^{\\text{total}}(\\text{YL})=173$, $E^{\\text{total}}(\\text{R})=137$, $E^{\\text{total}}(\\text{none})=126$, $E^{\\text{total}}(\\text{OL})=107$.

This problem challenges you to apply the influential Resource Availability Hypothesis, which predicts how the availability of key nutrients like nitrogen and carbon shapes a plant's defensive chemical profile. You will deduce the most likely defense strategy—nitrogen-based alkaloids versus carbon-based tannins—for plants adapted to contrasting nutrient environments, connecting ecological constraints to evolutionary outcomes [@problem_id:1768172].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying two closely related, hypothetical perennial plant species, *Petroflorus vulcanis* (Species V) and *Psammoflorus aridus* (Species S). Species V is adapted to grow in nutrient-rich volcanic loam, which has high concentrations of available nitrogen and phosphorus. Species S is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor coastal sand, where nitrogen is severely limited, but sunlight for photosynthesis is abundant. Both species are subject to similar levels of herbivory from generalist insects.\n\nYour task is to predict the primary chemical defense strategy for each species by applying the principles of the Resource Availability Hypothesis (RAH). The RAH provides a framework for understanding plant defense investment based on the following core tenets:\n1.  **Growth-Defense Trade-off:** There is a fundamental trade-off between a plant's investment in growth and its investment in defense. Resources allocated to one cannot be used for the other.\n2.  **Resource Limitation and Growth Rate:** A plant's maximum potential growth rate is determined by the availability of its most limiting resource. Plants in high-resource environments tend to be fast-growing, while plants in low-resource environments tend to be slow-growing.\n3.  **Defense Investment Strategy:** Slow-growing plants from low-resource environments will invest more heavily in defense than fast-growing plants from high-resource environments. This is because the cost of replacing tissues lost to herbivores is prohibitively high for slow-growers.\n4.  **Defense Type Selection:** The type of chemical defense compound a plant produces is influenced by the relative availability of the constituent elements (e.g., carbon vs. nitrogen). Plants are expected to evolve defenses based on elements that are relatively abundant and non-limiting to their growth.\n\nYou are to consider two major classes of defensive compounds:\n*   **Alkaloids:** Nitrogen-based compounds that are typically small, metabolically active (\"mobile\" defenses), and have a high turnover rate within the plant. They are highly toxic in small doses but can be costly if nitrogen is a limiting resource.\n*   **Tannins:** Carbon-based phenolic compounds that are typically large, structurally integrated into tissues like leaves and bark (\"immobile\" defenses), and have a low turnover rate. They function by reducing the digestibility of plant tissues and are built from carbon, which is acquired via photosynthesis.\n\nBased on an application of the Resource Availability Hypothesis, which of the following predictions about the primary defensive strategy of Species V and Species S is the most likely?\n\nA. Species V will primarily utilize tannins; Species S will primarily utilize alkaloids.\n\nB. Species V will primarily utilize alkaloids; Species S will primarily utilize tannins.\n\nC. Both species will primarily utilize tannins, as this immobile defense provides the most durable protection for perennial plants.\n\nD. Both species will primarily utilize alkaloids, as their high toxicity offers a more effective deterrent per unit mass.\n\nE. The defensive strategy is indeterminate, as the shared evolutionary history of the two species is a stronger determinant of defense type than their current environment.", "solution": "Apply the Resource Availability Hypothesis (RAH) step-by-step:\n\nFirst, diagnose resource environments and growth rates. Species V grows in nutrient-rich volcanic loam with high available nitrogen and phosphorus, so its most limiting resource is unlikely to be $N$ or $P$. By RAH tenet 2, high resource availability implies a fast potential growth rate. Species S grows in nutrient-poor coastal sand with severe nitrogen limitation but abundant light; by RAH tenet 2, nitrogen limitation constrains growth, so Species S is slow-growing despite high carbon assimilation potential from abundant light.\n\nSecond, infer defense investment levels from growth rates. By RAH tenet 3, slow-growing plants invest more in defense because tissue replacement is costly, whereas fast-growing plants invest less because they can more readily regrow after herbivory. Therefore, Species S should invest more in defense overall, and Species V should invest less.\n\nThird, select defense type based on elemental economy. By RAH tenet 4, plants evolve defenses built from relatively abundant, non-limiting elements.\n- For Species V, nitrogen is abundant and not strongly limiting, making nitrogen-based alkaloids relatively inexpensive. Moreover, alkaloids are small, metabolically active, and have high turnover, which aligns with fast-growing plants that favor mobile defenses they can readily synthesize and replace.\n- For Species S, nitrogen is severely limiting, so nitrogen-based alkaloids are costly. However, abundant sunlight allows robust carbon fixation, making carbon relatively more available than nitrogen. Thus, carbon-based tannins are favored. Tannins are large, structurally integrated, and have low turnover, consistent with the needs of slow-growing plants to protect long-lived tissues with durable, immobile defenses that reduce digestibility.\n\nFinally, herbivory levels are similar across both species, so differences in defense strategy should be driven primarily by resource availability rather than differential herbivore pressure.\n\nEvaluating the options: Option B states that Species V primarily utilizes alkaloids and Species S primarily utilizes tannins, which matches the RAH-based predictions above. Options A, C, and D ignore or contradict the resource-based allocation logic; Option E dismisses environmental effects despite the framework explicitly predicting environment-driven defense strategies, especially among closely related species.\n\nTherefore, the most likely prediction is that Species V primarily uses alkaloids and Species S primarily uses tannins.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1768172"}, {"introduction": "A coevolutionary arms race is ultimately a story written in the language of genes and populations. This problem elevates our analysis to the evolutionary level, examining how a novel defensive trait, such as egg mimicry, can invade a population. By modeling the fitness of plants with and without this new trait, you will determine the minimum level of herbivore pressure required for the benefits of the mimicry to outweigh its inherent metabolic costs, providing a quantitative look at natural selection in action [@problem_id:1768202].", "problem": "A species of tropical vine exhibits a classic evolutionary arms race with its primary herbivore, a species of butterfly. A rare mutation gives rise to a new allele, `M`, which is dominant over the ancestral wild-type allele, `m`. Plants with at least one `M` allele (genotypes `MM` or `Mm`) develop small, yellow glandular structures on their leaves that visually mimic the eggs of the butterfly. The butterfly has evolved a behavior to avoid laying eggs on leaves that appear to be already occupied, thus reducing future larval competition.\n\nConsider a large, panmictic (randomly mating) population of these diploid vines. The development of the egg-mimic structures incurs a constant metabolic cost, reducing the plant's baseline fitness by a fraction `c`. The damage from a single clutch of butterfly larvae feeding on a plant reduces its fitness by a fraction `d`.\n\nThe butterfly's avoidance behavior can be quantified by a dimensionless preference parameter, $\\beta$, where $0 < \\beta < 1$. A butterfly is $\\beta$ times as likely to lay its eggs on a plant with egg mimics as on a plant without them. Therefore, a smaller value of $\\beta$ indicates a more effective mimic. In a given generation, the total number of egg clutches laid by the entire butterfly population in the area is $H$, distributed among a total of $N$ plants.\n\nAssuming the mimic allele `M` is initially very rare in the population, determine the minimum herbivore pressure, defined as the average number of clutches per plant ($H/N$), that is required for this new allele to successfully invade and begin to spread through the plant population.", "solution": "Let the baseline fitness of a plant (without cost or herbivory) be normalized to 1.

We treat these reductions additively as stated: a plant with expected clutch load $h$ has fitness $1 - c - d h$ if it bears mimics, and $1 - d h$ if it does not.\n\nLet $H$ be the total number of clutches laid over $N$ plants in a generation.
