To do this, an experiment is conducted using controlled environment chambers. Genetically identical clones of the unknown grass species are grown from seedlings, alongside seedlings of a known C3 plant (wheat, *Triticum aestivum*) and a known C4 plant (maize, *Zea mays*) which serve as controls. All seedlings start with an identical initial dry biomass of $m_0 = 0.50$ grams.\n\nThe seedlings are divided into two groups. The first group is placed in a \"cool\" chamber maintained at a constant temperature of 20°C. The second group is placed in a \"hot\" chamber maintained at 35°C. All other environmental conditions, including light intensity, photoperiod, atmospheric Carbon Dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) concentration, and nutrient and water availability, are kept optimal and identical for all plants in both chambers.\n\nAfter a growth period of 30 days, the plants are harvested, and their final dry biomass is measured.

Let $A_{3}$ and $A_{4}$ denote the net assimilation rates of C3 and C4 plants, respectively, under the same incident light $I$ and electron transport rate $J=J(I)$. For a given $J$, the effective ATP cost per net $\\text{CO}_{2}$ fixed can be written symbolically.\n\nFor C3 photosynthesis, the net rate can be represented as\n$$\nA_{3} = A_{3}^{\\ast} - R_{p}(T,C_{i}) - R_{d},\n$$\nwhere $A_{3}^{\\ast}$ is the gross carboxylation rate in the absence of photorespiration, $R_{p}(T,C_{i})$ is the photorespiratory loss that increases with temperature $T$ and decreases with intercellular $\\text{CO}_{2}$ concentration $C_{i}$, and $R_{d}$ is day respiration.

Photorespiration $R_{p}$ decreases when temperature is lower and intercellular $\\text{CO}_{2}$ concentration $C_{i}$ is higher. High $C_{i}$ occurs with high stomatal conductance, which is promoted by moist soils and the absence of water or osmotic stress. Additionally, under low light, the extra ATP cost of the C4 pump becomes particularly disadvantageous relative to C3, because ATP supply per unit time is limited by $I$.\n\nEvaluate each scenario against the inequality:\n\nA. High temperature and intermittently dry soil decrease $C_{i}$ via stomatal closure and increase $R_{p}$, violating the criterion; favors C4.\n\nB. High altitude reduces atmospheric $\\text{CO}_{2}$, lowering $C_{i}$ and increasing $R_{p}$, despite cooler temperatures; the low $C_{i}$ drives the system toward C4 advantage.\n\nC. Low light, moderate temperature, and moist soil jointly minimize $R_{p}$ (cooler, high $C_{i}$ due to open stomata) while making the extra ATP cost $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ of C4 particularly burdensome; satisfies the criterion for C3 advantage.\n\nD. High salinity imposes osmotic stress, reducing stomatal conductance and $C_{i}$ even if humidity is high, increasing $R_{p}$; with full sun, the C4 ATP cost is less limiting; favors C4.\n\nE.
