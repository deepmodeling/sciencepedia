This event provides an opportunity to study the initiation of a coevolutionary arms race, often described by the Red Queen hypothesis.\n\nWe model the interaction using a simplified gene-for-gene system:\n- The host plant population has a single gene for resistance, $G$, with two alleles: a dominant resistance allele $R$ and a recessive susceptibility allele $r$.\n- The pathogenic fungus population has a single gene for virulence, $A$, with two alleles: an avirulent allele $v$ and a virulent allele $V$.\n\nThe rules of infection are as follows:\n- Plants with at least one $R$ allele (genotypes $RR$ or $Rr$) are resistant to infection by fungi with the $v$ allele, but are susceptible to fungi with the $V$ allele.\n- Plants with the $rr$ genotype are susceptible to infection by fungi with either the $v$ or $V$ allele.\n\nThe fitness consequences are defined by the following parameters, where host fitness is defined on a scale from 0 to 1:\n- Any successful infection reduces the host plant's fitness by a fraction $L = 0.45$.\n- A plant carrying the $R$ allele incurs a constitutive fitness cost of $c_R = 0.060$, regardless of whether it is infected.\n\nThe founding population of the fungus that colonizes the new host has an avirulent allele frequency of $q_v = 0.70$.\n\nAssuming the $R$ allele is initially very rare in the naive host population, a strong selective pressure to increase its frequency will arise. This pressure can be quantified by the initial selection coefficient, $s_R$, for the $R$ allele. The selection coefficient is defined as the difference between the average fitness of the resistance allele ($W_R$) and the average fitness of the susceptible allele ($W_r$).\n\nCalculate the numerical value of the initial selection coefficient, $s_R$.

Every 20 generations, they collect and freeze samples of both the yeast population and the virus population.\n\nAfter the 200 generations are complete, they conduct a \"time-shift\" experiment to test predictions of different coevolutionary models. They thaw the virus population that was isolated at generation 100 (abbreviated as $V_{100}$). They then measure the infectivity of $V_{100}$ against three different yeast populations:\n1.  A \"past\" host population, isolated at generation 60 ($H_{60}$).\n2.  A \"contemporary\" host population, isolated at generation 100 ($H_{100}$).\n3.  A \"future\" host population, isolated at generation 140 ($H_{140}$).\n\nInfectivity is quantified by measuring the \"lysis efficiency,\" which is the proportion of host cells destroyed by the virus in a standard assay. A higher lysis efficiency indicates that the virus is better adapted to that specific host population.

[@problem_id:1751952]", "problem": "A population of a fictional fish species, the Emerald Darter (*Etheostoma smaragdinus*), inhabits an isolated freshwater lake. For thousands of years, this population has been engaged in a coevolutionary arms race with a specialist parasitic fluke, *Clinostomum letalis*, which encysts in the fish's muscle tissue, severely impairing its motor function and reducing its reproductive fitness. The darter's primary defense is mediated by a single gene locus, known as the \"ImmunoLocus-A\" (ILA), which exhibits exceptionally high allelic diversity. This diversity is maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection, as the parasite continually evolves to target the most common ILA allele in the host population. Scientific studies have confirmed that the production and maintenance of the proteins encoded by resistance-conferring ILA alleles carry a significant metabolic cost for the fish, diverting energy from growth and reproduction.\n\nImagine a sudden and permanent geological event alters the lake's chemistry, leading to the complete and irreversible extinction of the parasitic fluke, *C. letalis*. The Emerald Darter population is able to survive and adapt to the new water chemistry.\n\nConsidering the established metabolic cost of resistance, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the evolutionary trajectory of the ILA locus in the Emerald Darter population several hundred generations after the parasite's extinction?\n\nA. The allelic diversity at the ILA locus will increase as the population is freed from the constraints of parasitic selection.\n\nB. The ILA locus will become functionally dormant, and its alleles will no longer be expressed, as they serve no purpose.\n\nC. The single most effective resistance allele that was present before the extinction will rapidly become fixed in the population.\n\nD. The frequencies of costly resistance-conferring alleles will decrease, leading to an overall reduction in allelic diversity at the ILA locus.\n\nE. The allelic frequencies at the ILA locus will remain largely unchanged, as the locus is now subject only to the slow process of genetic drift.", "solution": "We start by identifying the original selective regime: allelic diversity at the ILA locus was maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection because the parasite evolved to target the most common host allele, giving rare alleles a transient advantage. This is balancing selection that sustains many alleles.\n\nAfter the parasite’s extinction, the ecological interaction that created the negative frequency-dependent advantage disappears. The remaining selective force on the ILA locus is the documented metabolic cost of resistance. Let $c_{i}>0$ denote the per-allele metabolic cost associated with allele $i$. In the absence of any benefit from resistance, the relative fitness of carriers of allele $i$ is reduced. Symbolically, if $w_{i}$ denotes the marginal fitness effect of allele $i$ in the new environment, then\n$$\nw_{i}=1-c_{i},\n$$\nand for two alleles $A$ and $a$ with costs $c_{A}$ and $c_{a}$, genotype fitnesses (under standard diploid selection with additive costs for illustration) can be written as\n$$\nw_{AA}=1-2c_{A},\\quad w_{Aa}=1-(c_{A}+c_{a}),\\quad w_{aa}=1-2c_{a}.\n$$\nIf there exists a low-cost or effectively nonfunctional allele with $c_{a}\\approx 0$, then\n$$\nw_{aa}\\approx 1,\\quad w_{Aa}\\approx 1-c_{A},\\quad w_{AA}=1-2c_{A},\n$$\nwhich implies a negative selection coefficient against the costly resistance allele(s). In general, for allele frequency $p$ of a costly allele $A$ and mean fitness $\\bar{w}$, the standard selection recursion\n$$\np'=\\frac{p\\,w_{A}}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\nwith $w_{A}<1$ implies $p'<p$ whenever there exists a competing allele with lower cost (higher fitness). Because the parasite-driven negative frequency-dependent advantage has vanished, there is no counterbalancing force to maintain high diversity; instead, directional (purifying) selection favors alleles with the smallest $c_{i}$ and disfavors costly resistance variants.\n\nConsequently, over hundreds of generations, the frequencies of costly resistance-conferring alleles will decline. As multiple costly alleles are purged or reduced, the overall allelic diversity at the ILA locus will decrease. This process is faster than drift because it is driven by direct fitness differences $c_{i}>0$ rather than by random sampling. Complete silencing of the locus (functional dormancy) is not required and is not guaranteed; rather, selection will favor lower-expression or loss-of-function variants if they reduce cost, but the necessary prediction is a decline in costly alleles and a reduction in diversity.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the balancing mechanism maintaining diversity (negative frequency-dependent selection from the parasite) is gone; without a benefit, diversity will not increase.\n- B is too strong and mechanistically unwarranted; selection need not eliminate expression entirely, only reduce costly alleles.\n- C is incorrect because the most effective resistance allele confers no benefit post-extinction and remains costly, so it will not fix.\n- D is correct: costly resistance alleles decline in frequency, reducing overall allelic diversity at the ILA locus.\n- E is incorrect because selection against costs ($c_{i}>0$) will change allele frequencies more rapidly than drift alone.\n\nTherefore, the best prediction is that the frequencies of costly resistance-conferring alleles will decrease, leading to reduced allelic diversity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1751952"}]}
