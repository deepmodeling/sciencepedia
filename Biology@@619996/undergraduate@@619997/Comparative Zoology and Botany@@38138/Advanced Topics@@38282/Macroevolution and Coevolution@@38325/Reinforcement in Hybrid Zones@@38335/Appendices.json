Your goal is to identify the specific pattern of mating preference that provides the strongest evidence for reinforcement. This exercise highlights the core prediction of reinforcement theory: prezygotic reproductive barriers should be stronger in areas where two species coexist and risk producing unfit hybrids. [@problem_id:1772606]", "problem": "An ecologist is studying two closely related species of fruit fly, *Drosophila montanus* and *Drosophila vallis*. The geographic range of *D. montanus* is primarily at high altitudes, while *D. vallis* is found in low-altitude valleys. However, there is a narrow region of intermediate altitude where their ranges overlap, known as a sympatric zone. In all other parts of their ranges, the species are allopatric (they do not occur together). Field and laboratory studies have confirmed that when *D. montanus* and *D. vallis* interbreed in the sympatric zone, they produce hybrid offspring that are viable but completely sterile. This sterility represents a fitness cost to the parent flies.\n\nTo investigate whether natural selection is strengthening reproductive barriers in the zone of overlap—a process known as reinforcement—the ecologist conducts a mate-choice experiment. For the experiment, individual female flies are placed in a chamber with two males: one conspecific (same species as the female) and one heterospecific (the other species). The males are from populations that are also from the same type of geographic region (allopatric or sympatric) as the female. The first male the female chooses to mate with is recorded. This experiment is repeated with females from four distinct populations:\n1.  Allopatric *D. montanus*\n2.  Sympatric *D. montanus*\n3.  Allopatric *D. vallis*\n4.  Sympatric *D. vallis*\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would provide the strongest evidence for the occurrence of reinforcement?\n\nA. Females from both allopatric and sympatric populations of both species show an equally strong preference for mating with conspecific males.\n\nB. Females from the sympatric populations of both species show a significantly stronger preference for mating with conspecific males compared to the females from the allopatric populations.\n\nC. Females from the allopatric populations of both species show a significantly stronger preference for mating with conspecific males compared to the females from the sympatric populations.\n\nD. Females from all populations mate indiscriminately with both conspecific and heterospecific males, but no fertile offspring are produced from heterospecific pairings.\n\nE. Sympatric females of *D. montanus* show a strong preference for conspecific males, but sympatric females of *D. vallis* mate indiscriminately. Allopatric females of both species also mate indiscriminately.", "solution": "Reinforcement is the process by which natural selection strengthens prezygotic reproductive isolation in regions of sympatry when hybridization imposes a fitness cost. Here, field and lab data establish postzygotic isolation: hybrids are viable but completely sterile, imposing a fitness cost on parents that mate heterospecifically. By the principle of reinforcement, this cost generates selection favoring traits that reduce heterospecific matings (e.g., greater mate discrimination or assortative mating), specifically in sympatric populations where the risk of hybridization is present, and not necessarily in allopatric populations where such selection is absent.\n\nTherefore, the key prediction is that females from sympatric populations of both species will show stronger preference for conspecific males than females from allopatric populations. Evaluating the options:\n\n- Option A (equal preference in both allopatry and sympatry) shows no increase in prezygotic isolation in sympatry and thus does not support reinforcement.\n- Option B (sympatric females of both species show significantly stronger conspecific preference than allopatric females) matches the core prediction of reinforcement and provides the strongest evidence.\n- Option C (allopatric females show stronger conspecific preference) contradicts reinforcement.\n- Option D (indiscriminate mating with sterile hybrids) indicates postzygotic isolation only, not reinforcement of prezygotic barriers.\n- Option E (asymmetric pattern: only sympatric D. montanus shows conspecific preference) could indicate asymmetric or incomplete reinforcement, but it is weaker evidence than a parallel sympatric increase in both species.\n\nThus, the outcome most consistent with and most strongly evidencing reinforcement is that sympatric females of both species show stronger conspecific mate preference than allopatric females.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1772606"}, {"introduction": "Observing trait divergence in a hybrid zone is a crucial first step, but it is not definitive proof of reinforcement. This next exercise challenges you to distinguish reinforcement from a major alternative hypothesis known as ecological character displacement. By evaluating different experimental designs, you will learn how to isolate the effect of selection against hybridization from the effects of competition for resources. [@problem_id:1772549]", "problem": "An ecologist is studying two species of freshwater snails, *Helisoma atrox* and *Helisoma mitis*. In most of their ranges, the two species are allopatric (they do not live in the same geographic area). In these allopatric zones, both species exhibit a similar, rounded shell morphology with an average shell thickness of approximately 2.0 mm.\n\nHowever, there is a relatively large watershed where the species are sympatric (their ranges overlap). In this sympatric zone, the ecologist observes a striking pattern of divergence: *H. atrox* shells are significantly thicker, averaging 3.5 mm, while *H. mitis* shells are significantly thinner, averaging 0.5 mm. Genetic analysis confirms that hybridization occurs in the sympatric zone, and the resulting hybrid offspring have significantly reduced viability and fertility compared to purebred individuals.\n\nTwo primary hypotheses are proposed to explain this pattern of character displacement in the sympatric zone:\n1.  **Reinforcement**: The divergence in shell thickness is a prezygotic reproductive barrier. Snails use shell morphology as a tactile cue during mating, and the divergence reduces the frequency of costly hybridization events.\n2.  **Ecological Character Displacement (ECD)**: The divergence in shell thickness is related to resource partitioning. Thicker shells may allow *H. atrox* to consume harder-shelled prey (like small bivalves), while thinner shells may allow *H. mitis* to be more mobile and efficiently graze on soft algae, thus reducing interspecific competition for food.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs is the most direct and effective test to distinguish whether reinforcement is the primary driver of shell thickness divergence, as opposed to ecological character displacement?\n\nA. Place equal numbers of sympatric *H. atrox* and sympatric *H. mitis* in aquatic enclosures. To one set of enclosures, add only hard-shelled prey. To another set, add only soft algae. Measure the growth rate and survival of each snail species in both treatments over several months.\n\nB. Conduct mate-choice trials in a controlled lab setting. For each trial, place a single female in an aquarium with one male of her own species and one male of the other species. Compare the mating preferences (i.e., the proportion of time spent near or copulating with conspecific vs. heterospecific males) of females collected from the sympatric zone versus females collected from allopatric zones.\n\nC. Sequence the genomes of a large sample of snails from the sympatric and allopatric populations. Identify the specific genes responsible for shell thickness and determine the allele frequencies in each population to quantify the strength of selection.\n\nD. Measure the crushing force of a common crab predator on shells of varying thickness, from 0.5 mm to 3.5 mm. Correlate shell thickness with the probability of survival to determine the anti-predator advantage conferred by a thicker shell.\n\nE. Reciprocally transplant snails between allopatric and sympatric zones. That is, move allopatric snails to the sympatric zone and sympatric snails to an allopatric zone inhabited by the other species. Monitor their populations for multiple generations to see if their shell morphologies converge or diverge.", "solution": "We identify the key, discriminating predictions of the two hypotheses and then match them to the experimental designs provided.\n\nFirst, under reinforcement, postzygotic costs of hybridization in sympatry select for increased prezygotic isolation. The specific, testable prediction is that individuals from sympatric populations will show stronger assortative mating (prezygotic isolation) than individuals from allopatric populations, often termed reproductive character displacement in mating traits. The most direct experimental test is therefore to measure mate preferences and compare the strength of conspecific preference in sympatric versus allopatric populations. If reinforcement is the primary driver, sympatric individuals should exhibit significantly stronger preference for conspecifics than allopatric individuals, especially if shell morphology is used as a mating cue.\n\nSecond, under ecological character displacement (ECD), the primary prediction concerns resource-use performance and reduced interspecific competition via trait divergence, not necessarily any change in mating preferences. ECD predicts that each species will perform better on its preferred resource type, with trait differences aligning with resource specialization. However, ECD alone does not require or predict stronger prezygotic isolation in sympatry than allopatry.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\n- Option A manipulates resource environments (hard-shelled prey versus soft algae) and measures growth and survival. This directly tests the performance component central to ECD but does not assess prezygotic isolation or mating preferences. It therefore cannot directly determine whether reinforcement is the primary driver.\n\n- Option B conducts mate-choice trials comparing sympatric versus allopatric females’ preferences for conspecific versus heterospecific males. This directly measures prezygotic isolation and specifically tests the hallmark of reinforcement: stronger assortative mating in sympatry relative to allopatry. Because ECD does not require increased assortative mating, finding a sympatry-specific increase in conspecific preference would support reinforcement as the primary driver. Thus, Option B is the most direct and effective test to distinguish reinforcement from ECD.\n\n- Option C quantifies allele frequencies at shell-thickness loci and strength of selection. While informative about selection on morphology, it does not resolve whether selection is acting via mating isolation (reinforcement) or via resource competition (ECD).\n\n- Option D tests predation-related selection on shell thickness, which is orthogonal to distinguishing reinforcement from ECD, and therefore not a direct test of the focal hypotheses.\n\n- Option E uses reciprocal transplants across zones for multiple generations. This mixes many ecological and evolutionary processes, is slow and confounded, and still does not directly assess prezygotic isolation via mate preference. It is not the most direct test.\n\nTherefore, the experimental design that most directly and effectively distinguishes reinforcement as the primary driver, as opposed to ECD, is the mate-choice comparison between sympatric and allopatric populations described in Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1772549"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand an evolutionary process, it is often helpful to build a quantitative model. This practice moves beyond qualitative predictions and asks you to calculate the strength of selection driving reinforcement under a specific ecological scenario. By modeling how a \"satellite\" mating strategy affects the evolution of female choosiness, you can explore how real-world complexities can accelerate or inhibit this important evolutionary process. [@problem_id:1772579]", "problem": "In a stable hybrid zone, two sympatric species of field cricket, *Gryllus primus* (Species P) and *Gryllus secundus* (Species S), have equal population densities. Matings between these two species produce hybrid offspring with zero fitness. Purebred offspring have a baseline relative fitness of 1.\n\nThe mating system involves males of Species S producing a specific calling song to attract females. In response, some males of Species P have adopted a \"satellite\" mating tactic: they remain silent near a calling S male and attempt to intercept any approaching females for a mating.\n\nWe are interested in the evolution of female preference within Species S, which is governed by a single genetic locus. This locus has two alleles:\n-   **Allele $C$ (Choosy):** A female with at least one $C$ allele can perfectly distinguish between males of her own species (S) and satellite males (P), even at close range. If intercepted by a satellite P male, she will reject him and successfully locate and mate with the calling S male she was initially attracted to.\n-   **Allele $c$ (Non-choosy):** A homozygous $cc$ female is attracted to the calling song of S males, but she cannot distinguish an S male from a P male upon a close encounter. If intercepted by a satellite P male, she will mate with him.\n\nLet $k$ be the probability that a female (of either genotype) who is attracted to a calling S male is successfully intercepted by a satellite P male. If no interception occurs (with probability $1-k$), she proceeds to mate with the S male caller.\n\nTo evaluate the evolutionary impact of this satellite system, we compare it to a baseline \"random-mating\" scenario. In this baseline scenario, there are no satellite males, and non-choosy females simply mate randomly with any male they encounter in the environment. The strength of selection for an allele is defined as the difference in relative fitness between individuals with the allele and those without. Reinforcement is considered \"accelerated\" if the strength of selection for the choosy allele $C$ is greater in the satellite system than in the baseline scenario. Conversely, it is \"inhibited\" if the strength of selection is lower.\n\nCalculate the critical value of the interception probability, $k_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, at which the satellite system neither accelerates nor inhibits reinforcement compared to the baseline random-mating scenario. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "We compare the strength of selection on the choosy allele $C$ between the satellite system and the baseline random-mating scenario, defining strength of selection as the difference in relative fitness between $C$-carrying females and non-choosy $cc$ females.\n\nIn the satellite system:\n- A choosy $C$ female always mates with an S male because she rejects any intercepted P male and then mates with the S caller. Hence her expected fitness is\n$$\nW_{C}^{\\mathrm{sat}}=1.\n$$\n- A non-choosy $cc$ female mates with an S male if not intercepted (probability $1-k$) and with a P male if intercepted (probability $k$).
