This exercise challenges you to think like a field biologist studying a classic case of zoopharmacognosyâ€”chimpanzee leaf-swallowing. Your task is to select the most appropriate control group to test whether the medicinal benefit comes from the leaf's rough physical texture, rather than its chemical or nutritional properties. [@problem_id:1783702]", "problem": "A field biologist is studying a population of wild chimpanzees and observes a peculiar behavior. During certain times of the year, particularly when individuals appear lethargic or unwell, they are seen to seek out and swallow the whole, unchewed leaves of a specific plant species, *Aspilia mossambicensis*. These leaves are notable for their very rough, sandpaper-like texture due to the presence of stiff hairs called trichomes. Fecal analysis confirms that these whole leaves pass through the digestive tract largely intact, and also shows high concurrent expulsion of intestinal nematodes (a type of parasitic roundworm).\n\nThe biologist hypothesizes that this \"leaf-swallowing\" behavior is a form of self-medication (zoopharmacognosy) where the rough physical texture of the leaves mechanically purges worms from the gut, rather than providing a chemical or nutritional benefit.\n\nTo scientifically test this specific mechanical-purging hypothesis, the biologist needs to design an experiment involving a control group. The experimental group will consist of parasite-infected chimpanzees that are observed consuming the rough *Aspilia* leaves. Which of the following would be the most appropriate and rigorous control group to isolate the effect of the leaf's texture?\n\nA. A group of healthy, parasite-free chimpanzees from the same population.\n\nB. A group of parasite-infected chimpanzees that are fed a different, nutritionally common plant food that they normally chew.\n\nC. A group of parasite-infected chimpanzees that are administered a standard veterinary anti-parasitic drug.\n\nD. A group of parasite-infected chimpanzees that are given the same rough *Aspilia* leaves but are induced to chew them thoroughly before swallowing.\n\nE. A group of parasite-infected chimpanzees that are induced to swallow whole leaves from a naturally occurring smooth-leaf variant of the *Aspilia* species, which is chemically and nutritionally almost identical to the rough-leaf version.", "solution": "The core of this problem is to identify the control group that best isolates the variable of interest, which is the *mechanical action* of the leaf's rough texture. A well-designed control group should be identical to the experimental group in all respects except for the one variable being tested.\n\nThe hypothesis states that the *rough texture* of the leaves is responsible for mechanically removing parasites. The experimental group consists of parasite-infected chimpanzees swallowing rough leaves. Let's analyze each potential control group:\n\n**Option A: A group of healthy, parasite-free chimpanzees from the same population.**\nThis group is not a suitable control for testing the treatment. The initial condition (parasite infection) is absent. This group would serve as a baseline for what a healthy chimpanzee's fecal sample looks like, but it cannot tell us if the leaf treatment is effective or not, because there is no problem to treat. A proper control group must also be infected with parasites to see if the control \"treatment\" fails to cure them.\n\n**Option B: A group of parasite-infected chimpanzees that are fed a different, nutritionally common plant food that they normally chew.**\nThis is a poor control because it introduces multiple confounding variables. The plant is a different species, so its nutritional content and chemical composition (secondary metabolites) will be different from *Aspilia*. Furthermore, the behavior (chewing vs. swallowing whole) is different. If this control group showed a different outcome, it would be impossible to determine if the difference was due to the lack of rough texture, a different chemical profile, a different nutritional profile, or the act of chewing.\n\n**Option C: A group of parasite-infected chimpanzees that are administered a standard veterinary anti-parasitic drug.**\nThis group is known as a *positive control*. It is used to validate the experiment by showing that a known effective treatment works in the current experimental setup. While useful for comparing the *efficacy* of leaf-swallowing to modern medicine, it does not help in understanding the *mechanism* of the leaf-swallowing. It doesn't isolate the variable of leaf texture; instead, it introduces a completely different treatment.\n\n**Option D: A group of parasite-infected chimpanzees that are given the same rough *Aspilia* leaves but are induced to chew them thoroughly before swallowing.**\nThis is a better control than A, B, or C, as it uses the same plant. Chewing would destroy the whole-leaf structure and its sandpaper-like surface, thus eliminating the proposed mechanical mechanism. However, chewing also fundamentally changes how the leaf is digested and which chemical compounds are released and absorbed. It is possible that chewing releases chemicals that are toxic to the parasites (or to the chimp), or that it makes nutrients more available. Therefore, this control group tests the importance of \"swallowing whole\" but does not perfectly isolate the \"texture\" variable from the \"chemical release\" variable.\n\n**Option E: A group of parasite-infected chimpanzees that are induced to swallow whole leaves from a naturally occurring smooth-leaf variant of the *Aspilia* species, which is chemically and nutritionally almost identical to the rough-leaf version.**\nThis is the most scientifically rigorous control group. It directly isolates the variable of interest: surface texture.\n- Both the experimental group (rough leaves) and control group (smooth leaves) are parasite-infected.\n- Both groups perform the same behavior (swallowing whole leaves).\n- Both groups consume leaves from the same plant species, meaning the nutritional value and, most importantly, the chemical composition are as close to identical as possible.\nThe only significant difference between the two groups is the presence or absence of the rough trichomes. Therefore, any statistically significant difference in parasite expulsion between the two groups can be confidently attributed to the mechanical action of the leaf's surface texture.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1783702"}, {"introduction": "The line between a medicine and a poison is often a matter of dose, a principle that is fundamental to zoopharmacognosy.

They have established the following baseline information:\n\n1.  **Dietary Sources and Isotopic Signatures**: The bears' potential food sources in this ecosystem have been analyzed for their stable isotope ratios of carbon ($\\delta^{13}\\text{C}$) and nitrogen ($\\delta^{15}\\text{N}$).

Let the hair grow at rate $r=1.2$ cm per month, with collection at time $T$ (October 1). A position $x$ cm from the base corresponds to growth completed at time $T-x/r$. Therefore, a segment $[a,b]$ cm maps to the interval $[T-b/r,\\,T-a/r]$.\n\nApplying this to the three segments of a 6.0 cm hair:\n- Segment $[0.0,1.2]$ cm maps to $[T-1.2/r,\\,T] = [T-1,\\,T]$, i.e., September.\n- Segment $[1.2,3.6]$ cm maps to $[T-3,\\,T-1]$, i.e., Julyâ€“August.\n- Segment $[3.6,6.0]$ cm maps to $[T-5,\\,T-3]$, i.e., Mayâ€“June.\n\nParasite load is low in Mayâ€“June, peaks in Julyâ€“August, and declines in September.\n\nWe use trophic discrimination to infer diet from hair isotope values.

Thus a salmonâ€“greens mix cannot reproduce the Julyâ€“August isotope pair; the Angelica-root match remains the only consistent source.\n\n- Option C (inconclusive due to similarity of roots and greens) is not supported because $\\delta^{13}C$ values of roots ($-24$) and greens ($-28$) are sufficiently distinct, and the Julyâ€“August hair $\\delta^{13}C_{h}=-23.8$ falls squarely in the root-consistent interval and outside the greens-consistent interval.\n\n- Option D (prophylactic spring consumption) is contradicted by Mayâ€“June data indicating greens, not roots.\n\n- Option E (physiological stress elevating $\\delta^{15}N$ rather than diet change) is inconsistent with the observed mid-summer $\\delta^{15}N$ drop relative to salmon-rich and even greens-like consumer values; catabolic stress typically increases $\\delta^{15}N$, not decreases it.\n\nTherefore, the data most strongly support a dietary shift toward Angelica roots specifically during the parasite peak, consistent with the zoopharmacognosy hypothesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1783689"}]}
