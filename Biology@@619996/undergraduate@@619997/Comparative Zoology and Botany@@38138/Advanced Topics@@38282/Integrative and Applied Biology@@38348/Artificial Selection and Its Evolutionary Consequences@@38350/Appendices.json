Its 'exploratory score' is the number of unique grid squares the mouse enters within a 5-minute observation period.\n\nThe initial parental generation has a mean exploratory score of 52.0. From this population, the researchers select a specific group of individuals with the highest scores to be the parents of the next generation.

This exercise explores the profound trade-offs that can arise, where traits beneficial in a domesticated environment become severe liabilities in the wild. By calculating the overall relative fitness of the domesticated silk moth in its ancestral habitat, you will learn how to quantify the cumulative impact of various maladaptive traits on survival and reproduction, providing a stark illustration of the hidden costs of domestication [@problem_id:1731941].", "problem": "The domestic silk moth, *Bombyx mori*, has been subject to thousands of years of artificial selection for traits that maximize silk production. This process has resulted in significant divergence from its wild ancestor, *Bombyx mandarina*. Consider a hypothetical scenario where a large population of *Bombyx mori* is accidentally released into a protected nature reserve, which constitutes the native habitat of *Bombyx mandarina*.\n\nTo assess the potential impact and long-term viability of the released population, we want to calculate its overall fitness relative to its wild ancestor. The fitness of an organism is a measure of its total reproductive success and can be modeled as the product of the probabilities of surviving through different life stages and the number of offspring produced.\n\nThe wild ancestor, *Bombyx mandarina*, is perfectly adapted to this environment, and we define its overall fitness as a baseline value of 1.0. The domesticated traits of *Bombyx mori* alter its fitness components as follows when placed in this wild environment:\n\n1.  **Larval Survival:** The conspicuous white coloration of *B. mori* larvae, a trait selected for by humans, makes them highly visible to predators. Consequently, their probability of surviving from hatching to pupation is only 4.0% of that of the well-camouflaged *B. mandarina* larvae.\n\n2.  **Adult Success (Survival and Mating):** Adult *B. mori* moths have lost the ability to fly. The females are sedentary, and males exhibit only a weak, fluttering flight. This drastically impairs their ability to evade predators and for males to locate the stationary females. The combined effect is that the probability of a *B. mori* adult surviving long enough to mate *and* successfully finding a mate is a mere 0.50% of that for a wild *B. mandarina* adult.\n\n3.  **Fecundity:** Artificial selection has resulted in larger *B. mori* females that produce more eggs. A *B. mori* female that successfully mates will lay, on average, 1.8 times the number of eggs as a wild *B. mandarina* female.\n\nAssuming these three factors are multiplicative in their effect on overall fitness, calculate the overall relative fitness value of the released *Bombyx mori* population.

This problem delves into the genetic consequences of changing the selective landscape by modeling a captive breeding program where sexual selection is nullified. You will track the frequency of an allele for a costly courtship display over several generations, revealing how the removal of one selective pressure can unmask and amplify another. This practice provides insight into the subtle, yet powerful, ways that population genetics governs the fate of traits when evolutionary \"rules\" are changed [@problem_id:1731912].", "problem": "A conservation program is established for a rare species of bird-of-paradise. In their natural habitat, males perform an elaborate and energetically demanding courtship dance to attract mates. The complexity of this dance is determined by a single autosomal gene with two alleles: a dominant allele `D` and a recessive allele `d`. Birds with at least one `D` allele (genotypes `DD` or `Dd`) perform the complex dance, while homozygous recessive birds (`dd`) perform a much simpler, less costly version.\n\nThe initial captive population is large and in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), with the frequency of the recessive allele `d` being $q_0 = 0.1$. To maximize genetic diversity, the conservationists implement a strict random-mating protocol, where breeding pairs are chosen without regard to courtship displays. This practice effectively nullifies the mating advantage previously conferred by the complex dance.\n\nHowever, the complex dance still imposes a significant metabolic cost, which slightly reduces the viability of individuals performing it. This manifests as a selective pressure against the `D` allele. The relative fitness of individuals performing the complex dance (`DD` and `Dd` genotypes) is $w_{complex} = 1 - s$, while the fitness of individuals with the simple dance (`dd` genotype) is $w_{simple} = 1$. The selection coefficient is given as $s = 0.05$.\n\nAssuming the population remains large and mating is random in each generation, calculate the frequency of the recessive allele `d` after 5 generations of this captive breeding program.

The viability fitnesses are $w_{DD} = 1 - s$ for `DD`, $w_{Dd} = 1 - s$ for `Dd`, and $w_{dd} = 1$ for `dd`. Under random mating and viability selection, before selection the genotype frequencies are Hardy-Weinberg: $p^2$, $2pq$, $q^2$. After selection, the unnormalized genotype frequencies are $p^2(1 - s)$, $2pq(1 - s)$, $q^2$, with mean fitness\n$$\n\\bar{w} = p^2(1 - s) + 2pq(1 - s) + q^2 = (1 - s)(p^2 + 2pq) + q^2 = (1 - s)(1 - q^2) + q^2 = 1 - s + sq^2.\n$$\nThe frequency of $d$ after selection is\n$$\nq' = \\frac{q^2 \\cdot 1 + pq \\cdot (1 - s)}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{q\\left[q + (1 - q)(1 - s)\\right]}{1 - s + sq^2} = \\frac{q\\left(1 - s + sq\\right)}{1 - s + sq^2}.\n$$\nThus, with $s = 0.05$, the recurrence is\n$$\nq_{t+1} = \\frac{q_t\\left(0.95 + 0.05 q_t\\right)}{0.95 + 0.05 q_t^2}.\n$$\nStarting from $q_0 = 0.1$, iterate for five generations:\n\nGeneration 1:\n$$\nA_0 = 0.95 + 0.05(0.1) = 0.955, \\quad B_0 = 0.95 + 0.05(0.1)^2 = 0.9505,\n$$\n$$\nq_1 = 0.1 \\cdot \\frac{0.955}{0.9505} \\approx 0.100473593.\n$$\n\nGeneration 2:\n$$\nA_1 = 0.95 + 0.05(0.100473593) \\approx 0.95502367965,\n$$\n$$\nq_1^2 \\approx 0.0100949429, \\quad B_1 = 0.95 + 0.05(0.0100949429) \\approx 0.950504747145,\n$$\n$$\nq_2 = 0.100473593 \\cdot \\frac{0.95502367965}{0.950504747145} \\approx 0.100951269.\n$$\n\nGeneration 3:\n$$\nA_2 = 0.95 + 0.05(0.100951269) \\approx 0.95504756345,\n$$\n$$\nq_2^2 \\approx 0.010191158713, \\quad B_2 = 0.95 + 0.05(0.010191158713) \\approx 0.95050955793565,\n$$\n$$\nq_3 = 0.100951269 \\cdot \\frac{0.95504756345}{0.95050955793565} \\approx 0.10143324.\n$$\n\nGeneration 4:\n$$\nA_3 = 0.95 + 0.05(0.10143324) \\approx 0.955071662,\n$$\n$$\nq_3^2 \\approx 0.0102887021768976, \\quad B_3 = 0.95 + 0.05(0.0102887021768976) \\approx 0.9505144351088449,\n$$\n$$\nq_4 = 0.10143324 \\cdot \\frac{0.955071662}{0.9505144351088449} \\approx 0.10191956.\n$$\n\nGeneration 5:\n$$\nA_4 = 0.95 + 0.05(0.10191956) \\approx 0.955095978,\n$$\n$$\nq_4^2 \\approx 0.0103875967105936, \\quad B_4 = 0.95 + 0.05(0.0103875967105936) \\approx 0.9505193798355297,\n$$\n$$\nq_5 = 0.10191956 \\cdot \\frac{0.955095978}{0.9505193798355297} \\approx 0.102410286.\n$$\n\nRounded to four significant figures, the allele frequency after five generations is $0.1024$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1024}$$", "id": "1731912"}]}
