The Gram stain is arguably the most critical differential staining technique in bacteriology, and mastering it requires understanding the function of each reagent. This practice challenges you to think critically about the procedure by diagnosing the outcome of a common experimental error, reinforcing the chemical principles that make the technique work [@problem_id:1753621].", "problem": "In a microbiology laboratory, a student is tasked with identifying the components of a mixed bacterial culture using the Gram stain technique. The culture is known to contain two species: *Staphylococcus epidermidis*, a spherical bacterium (coccus), and *Escherichia coli*, a rod-shaped bacterium (bacillus).\n\nThe standard Gram stain procedure, which differentiates bacteria based on their cell wall composition, involves the following four sequential steps:\n1.  Application of the primary stain, crystal violet, which stains all cells purple.\n2.  Application of a mordant, Gram's iodine, which forms an insoluble complex with the crystal violet.\n3.  Application of a decolorizer (an alcohol-acetone mixture), which removes the stain from certain types of cells.\n4.  Application of a counterstain, safranin, which stains the now-decolorized cells pink or red.\n\nProperly executed, this procedure results in Gram-positive bacteria (with thick peptidoglycan cell walls that trap the crystal violet-iodine complex) appearing purple, and Gram-negative bacteria (with thin peptidoglycan walls) appearing pink or red.\n\nThe student performs the staining procedure, but accidentally omits Step 2, the application of Gram's iodine. All other steps, including the application of crystal violet, the decolorizer, and the safranin, are performed correctly and in the proper sequence.\n\nGiven this specific error, what will the student observe when viewing the prepared slide under a light microscope?\n\nA. Both *S. epidermidis* (cocci) and *E. coli* (bacilli) will appear purple.\n\nB. *S. epidermidis* (cocci) will appear purple, and *E. coli* (bacilli) will appear pink.\n\nC.

Both *S. epidermidis* (cocci) and *E. coli* (bacilli) will be colorless.", "solution": "The purpose of the Gram stain is to differentiate bacteria based on the physical and chemical properties of their cell walls. Let's analyze the function of each step and the consequence of omitting the mordant, Gram's iodine.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Application of Crystal Violet.** The primary stain, crystal violet, is a positively charged dye that enters all bacterial cells, staining both the Gram-positive *Staphylococcus epidermidis* and the Gram-negative *Escherichia coli* purple. This step was performed correctly.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Application of Gram's Iodine (Omitted).** This is the critical error. Gram's iodine acts as a mordant. Its function is to complex with the crystal violet inside the cell, forming a large, insoluble crystal violet-iodine (CV-I) complex. In a correct procedure, this large complex becomes trapped within the thick, highly cross-linked peptidoglycan layer of Gram-positive cells but not in the thin peptidoglycan layer of Gram-negative cells. Since this step was omitted, no CV-I complex is formed. The crystal violet molecules remain small and soluble within both cell types.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Application of Decolorizer (Alcohol-Acetone).** The decolorizer's role is to dissolve lipids in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and dehydrate the peptidoglycan layer of Gram-positive bacteria. In a normal procedure, this dehydrating effect shrinks the pores of the Gram-positive cell wall, trapping the large CV-I complexes inside. However, because the iodine was omitted, there are no large complexes to trap. The small, soluble crystal violet molecules are not retained by the thick peptidoglycan wall of *S. epidermidis* and are readily washed out by the alcohol. Similarly, the crystal violet is washed out from the *E. coli* cells. Therefore, after this step, both the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria will be left colorless.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Application of Safranin.** The counterstain, safranin, is applied to the slide. Since both the *S. epidermidis* and *E. coli* cells were rendered colorless by the decolorization step, they are both available to take up the safranin stain. Safranin is a pink/red dye.\n\n**Conclusion:** As a result of this procedural error, both the Gram-positive *S. epidermidis* (cocci) and the Gram-negative *E. coli* (bacilli) will be stained by the safranin and will appear pink. Therefore, the student will observe pink cocci and pink bacilli under the microscope.

In microscopy, this is achieved through micrometry, the process of using a calibrated ruler in the eyepiece to measure specimens.

To measure the size of stomata, the student must first calibrate the ocular micrometer (the ruler visible in the eyepiece) at a specific magnification.

The smallest division on the stage micrometer is known to be 10 micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$) long.

Using the same 40x objective, they measure the length of several stomata on each slide. The average length of a monocot stoma is measured to be 25 ocular divisions. The average length of a dicot stoma is measured to be 18 ocular divisions.\n\nCalculate the physical lengths of the stomata and their relative size.
