For this model, assume that the flow rates of water across the gills and blood through the gill lamellae are identical and that the gas exchange surface is perfectly efficient, meaning diffusion is not a limiting factor.\n\nWe define the oxygen extraction efficiency of the gill as the ratio of the actual increase in the blood's oxygen partial pressure to the maximum possible increase.

This exercise places you in the role of a historical biogeographer, tasked with deciphering the story behind the disjunct distribution of pipid frogs across South America and Africa.

Two primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain this pattern. The first is the Gondwanan vicariance hypothesis, which posits that a common ancestor was widespread across West Gondwana, and the subsequent separation of the South American and African tectonic plates isolated these populations, leading to their divergence. The second is the oceanic dispersal hypothesis, which suggests that pipid frogs originated on one of the continents (e.g., Africa) and later dispersed across the Atlantic Ocean to colonize the other continent after they were already separated.\n\nYou are provided with the following historical and phylogenetic data:\n1.  **Paleogeographic Record:** Geological evidence indicates that the final separation of South America and Africa, resulting in a permanent, deep-water marine barrier between the two continents, was complete by approximately 100 million years ago (Ma).\n2.  **Molecular Phylogeny:** A recent, time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of the family Pipidae, constructed using multiple nuclear and mitochondrial genes, robustly places the divergence time for the last common ancestor of the South American Pipinae and the African Xenopodinae at 85 Ma, with a 95% confidence interval of 78 Ma to 92 Ma.\n\nBased solely on a critical evaluation of the provided chronological data, which of the following statements represents the most scientifically sound conclusion?\n\nA.

Therefore, the age of the last common ancestor of the two clades should be approximately equal to, or slightly older than, the time of the final geographic separation. The divergence of the lineages cannot happen millions of years *after* the barrier is already in place if the barrier itself is the cause of divergence. So, for the vicariance hypothesis to be supported, the divergence time should be around 100 Ma.\n\n*   **Dispersal Hypothesis Prediction:** If the frogs originated on one continent and then crossed the ocean to the other (dispersal), this event must have occurred *after* the continents were already separated by a marine barrier. An ancestral population would exist on one continent, and a founder group would disperse to the other. The divergence between the new colonizing population and the source population would begin only after this dispersal event. Therefore, for the dispersal hypothesis to be supported, the biological divergence time must be *younger* than the time of final geologic separation.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the provided data with the predictions.**\n*   Geological separation date: ~100 Ma.\n*   Biological divergence date: 85 Ma (with a 95% confidence interval of 78-92 Ma).\n\nLet's analyze the timeline. The biological divergence at 85 Ma is 15 million years *after* the continents were fully separated at 100 Ma. Crucially, the entire 95% confidence interval for the divergence (78 Ma to 92 Ma) lies well after the 100 Ma separation event. The upper limit of the confidence interval, 92 Ma, is still 8 million years after the continents were definitively separated.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the hypotheses based on the comparison.**\n*   The data contradict the prediction of the vicariance hypothesis. The divergence of the frogs happened long after the vicariant event (the continental split) was complete. If vicariance were the cause, the divergence should have been dated to ~100 Ma, but the molecular data confidently places it as being much younger.\n*   The data are consistent with the prediction of the dispersal hypothesis. The continents were separated by 100 Ma, creating the Atlantic Ocean. Subsequently, around 85 Ma, a dispersal event from one continent to the other could have occurred, establishing a new population that then diverged from its ancestral stock. This scenario perfectly fits the observation that the biological divergence is younger than the geological separation.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the given multiple-choice options.**\n*   **A. The vicariance hypothesis is supported because the estimated organismal divergence at 85 Ma occurred before the geological separation at 100 Ma.** This statement incorrectly states the temporal relationship. 85 Ma is *after* 100 Ma.\n*   **B. The dispersal hypothesis is supported because the estimated organismal divergence at 85 Ma occurred significantly after the geological separation at 100 Ma.** This statement correctly identifies the temporal relationship (85 Ma is after 100 Ma) and draws the correct conclusion based on that relationship. The divergence happening *after* the separation is the key evidence for dispersal.\n*   **C. The vicariance hypothesis is supported because the biological divergence date (85 Ma) is relatively close to the geological separation date (100 Ma), with the discrepancy attributable to statistical uncertainty in the molecular clock.** This is incorrect. The 95% confidence interval (78-92 Ma) is provided to account for statistical uncertainty, and the entire interval falls after the separation date. Therefore, the discrepancy is statistically significant and cannot be dismissed.\n*   **D. The dispersal hypothesis is supported because the organismal divergence at 85 Ma occurred before the geological separation at 100 Ma, allowing the ancestral group to disperse before the continents moved too far apart.** This statement uses faulty logic. It confuses the timeline (85 Ma is not before 100 Ma) and misunderstands the dispersal hypothesis, which requires dispersal *across* an existing barrier.\n*   **E. The data are inconclusive because both dates fall within the Cretaceous Period, making it impossible to determine the sequence of events.** This is incorrect. The specific timing of events, not just the geological period they fall into, is the crucial information for distinguishing between the hypotheses. The sequence is clearly determinable from the given dates.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B is the only one that correctly interprets the data and applies the principles of historical biogeography.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1743769"}]}
