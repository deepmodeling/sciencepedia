Both specimens exhibit a distinct head followed by a long, segmented trunk with numerous legs.\n\nSpecimen A possesses a body that is clearly flattened in the dorsoventral plane. The first pair of its trunk appendages are not used for walking; instead, they are enlarged, hardened, and modified into sharp, pincer-like structures called forcipules that curve forward and meet in the ventral midline beneath the head.\n\nSpecimen B has a body that is approximately circular in cross-section. Its first few trunk segments bear simple, unmodified walking legs, indistinguishable in form from the legs on subsequent segments.\n\nBased solely on these morphological observations, which of the following statements most accurately contrasts the primary feeding strategies of Specimen A and Specimen B?\n\nA. Specimen A is a predator, while Specimen B is a detritivore or herbivore.\n\nB. Specimen A is a detritivore or herbivore, while Specimen B is a predator.\n\nC. Both specimens are predators, with the forcipules of Specimen A being used for prey capture and the cylindrical body of Specimen B being an adaptation for ambushing prey in burrows.\n\nD. Both specimens are detritivores or herbivores, with the forcipules of Specimen A being a defensive structure and the cylindrical body of Specimen B being adapted for burrowing through substrate.\n\nE. The observed differences in body shape and appendage modification are primarily related to locomotion and habitat selection (e.g., speed vs. burrowing force) and are not reliable indicators of their primary feeding strategies.", "solution": "Identify diagnostic morphology of Specimen A: a dorsoventrally flattened body and the first pair of trunk appendages modified into forcipules that curve forward and meet beneath the head. In myriapods, forcipules are a hallmark of class Chilopoda (centipedes). Functional inference: forcipules are not used for locomotion; they are hardened, fang-like appendages derived from maxillipeds, specialized for seizing and envenomating prey. Therefore, their primary function is prey capture and subjugation, indicating a predatory feeding strategy.\n\nIdentify diagnostic morphology of Specimen B: a body approximately circular in cross-section and the first trunk segments bearing simple, unmodified walking legs like subsequent segments, with no forcipules. This configuration is characteristic of class Diplopoda (millipedes), which typically have unmodified walking legs (often two pairs per diplosegment after the anterior segments) and lack venom claws. Functional inference: millipedes generally possess mouthparts adapted for processing plant material and detritus and rely on chemical defenses (e.g., repugnatorial glands) rather than offensive predation. Thus their primary feeding strategy is detritivory or herbivory.\n\nEvaluate options against these inferences:\n- A states Specimen A is a predator and Specimen B is a detritivore or herbivore; this matches the functional-morphological conclusions.\n- B reverses the assignments and contradicts the role of forcipules.\n- C incorrectly assigns predation to both; cylindrical body in Diplopoda is not an adaptation for ambush predation, and they lack forcipules.\n- D incorrectly assigns detritivory/herbivory to both and mischaracterizes forcipules as merely defensive; forcipules are offensive prey-capture structures.\n- E is incorrect because the presence or absence of forcipules is a reliable indicator of feeding strategy, not just locomotion or habitat.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate contrast is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1761903"}, {"introduction": "The incredible success of arthropods includes several independent transitions from water to land, each with unique challenges. This exercise [@problem_id:1761909] explores the concept of evolutionary constraint by focusing on terrestrial isopods, or pill bugs. You will analyze how their ancestrally aquatic respiratory structures create a critical physiological trade-off that restricts them to moist habitats, demonstrating how morphology can define a species' ecological boundaries.", "problem": "Terrestrial isopods, commonly known as pill bugs or sow bugs, represent a uniquely successful lineage of crustaceans that have adapted to a fully terrestrial existence. Unlike insects and arachnids, which evolved on land and developed highly efficient respiratory systems for conserving water (like tracheal systems), isopods have ancestrally aquatic respiratory organs. Their gas exchange occurs via delicate, flattened appendages on their abdomen known as pleopods, which function as gills. Despite their terrestrial success, these animals are conspicuously absent from dry, arid environments and are almost exclusively found in damp soil, under logs, or in leaf litter.\n\nGiven this information, what is the primary physiological reason that the structure of their pleopodal gills restricts most terrestrial isopods to moist environments?\n\nA. The large, moist surface area of the pleopods, necessary for gas diffusion, results in a high rate of evaporative water loss (desiccation) in dry air.\n\nB. Their open circulatory system, containing hemolymph, cannot generate sufficient pressure to transport oxygen effectively unless the external environment is saturated with water vapor.\n\nC. The pleopods are also the primary site for excreting nitrogenous waste as highly toxic ammonia, a process which requires large volumes of environmental water for safe dilution.\n\nD. The thin chitin of the pleopodal gills is permeable to atmospheric pollutants that are neutralized in moist conditions but become toxic in dry air.\n\nE. Gas exchange in isopods relies on dissolved oxygen in a film of water on the gills, and they are incapable of extracting gaseous oxygen directly from the air.", "solution": "We identify the constraint from respiratory anatomy and the physics of diffusion and evaporation. Terrestrial isopods retain ancestrally aquatic respiratory organs: thin, flattened pleopods that function as gills and must be kept moist for gas exchange. Gas exchange across a membrane follows Fick’s law, so the diffusive flux of oxygen through a thin, moist pleopod surface can be written as\n$$\nJ_{\\text{O}_{2}}=-D_{\\text{O}_{2}}\\frac{dC_{\\text{O}_{2}}}{dx},\n$$\nand the total oxygen transfer rate scales as $J_{\\text{O}_{2}}A$, where $A$ is the effective surface area and $x$ is the path length (thickness). Efficient gas exchange requires a large $A$ and a small $x$, and the surface must remain moist to maintain a dissolved phase for molecular diffusion and to prevent collapse of the delicate exchange surface.\n\nThe same physical properties that maximize $J_{\\text{O}_{2}}$—large area, thin barrier, and a moist surface—also drive high evaporative water loss. The diffusive flux of water vapor away from a moist surface into air is\n$$\nJ_{\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}}=-D_{\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}}\\frac{d\\rho_{v}}{dx},\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{v}$ is the water vapor density. In dry air, the external $\\rho_{v}$ is low, so the gradient $\\frac{d\\rho_{v}}{dx}$ at the pleopod surface is large, and evaporative loss $\\Phi_{\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}}=J_{\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}}A$ becomes substantial. Because pleopods cannot be sealed off without halting gas exchange, this evaporative flux leads to rapid desiccation unless ambient humidity is high enough to reduce the gradient. Thus, the primary physiological reason for the restriction to moist environments is that the pleopods’ large, moist respiratory surface area, necessary for diffusion, inherently causes high water loss in dry air.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A directly states the above mechanism: large, moist surface for diffusion results in high evaporative water loss in dry air. This aligns with Fickian diffusion and evaporation.\n- B is not the limiting factor; an open circulatory system does not require saturated external humidity to transport oxygen.\n- C misattributes a primary constraint to nitrogen excretion; while some crustaceans excrete ammonia, terrestrial isopods are not primarily limited by the need for bulk environmental water for excretion at the respiratory surface.\n- D is unsupported; permeability to pollutants is not the key determinant of habitat moisture requirements.\n- E is incorrect; isopods can extract oxygen from air via a moist film; they do not require dissolved oxygen in bulk external water, only a moist surface to sustain diffusion and prevent desiccation.\n\nTherefore, the primary physiological reason is the evaporative water loss from the large, moist pleopodal respiratory surfaces in dry air.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1761909"}, {"introduction": "The diversity of arthropod body plans is a product of changes in the underlying genetic toolkit that patterns the embryo. This problem [@problem_id:1761919] places you in the role of an evolutionary developmental biologist to explore how tagmosis—the grouping of segments into functional units—is genetically controlled. By simulating an experiment that manipulates a key *Hox* gene, you will make a quantitative prediction about how changes in gene expression can reshape an animal's morphology.", "problem": "An evolutionary developmental biologist is studying tagmosis in a hypothetical branchiopod crustacean, *Branchipodus experimentalis*. The adult body plan of this species consists of a head followed by 20 post-cephalic segments. These 20 segments are organized into two tagmata: an anterior thorax comprising 11 segments, each bearing a pair of phyllopods (flattened, leaf-like appendages used for swimming and feeding), and a posterior abdomen comprising 9 limbless segments.\n\nGenetic analysis reveals that the identity of the abdominal segments is determined by the expression of the Hox gene *Abdominal-A* (*abd-A*), which is expressed exclusively in segments 12 through 20. In these segments, *abd-A* functions to repress the limb development pathway. The default developmental fate for a post-cephalic segment, in the absence of *abd-A* expression, is to form a thoracic-type segment with a pair of phyllopods.\n\nTo test the role of *abd-A* in appendage suppression, the biologist performs an experiment using RNA interference (RNAi), a technique that silences gene expression. The RNAi treatment targeting *abd-A* is applied during embryonic development. The treatment is effective but incomplete: on average, it successfully silences the *abd-A* gene in 70.0% of the abdominal segments in any given animal. The treatment has no effect on the 11 thoracic segments.\n\nAssuming the experiment is performed on a large population of *B. experimentalis* embryos, calculate the average total number of phyllopod-bearing segments per individual in the treated population. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the average total number of phyllopod-bearing segments on an animal after an RNA interference (RNAi) treatment. We can solve this by first determining the number of such segments in a normal animal and then calculating the additional number of segments that develop phyllopods due to the experimental treatment.\n\nFirst, let's establish the baseline morphology of an untreated *Branchipodus experimentalis*. The problem states that the animal has a thorax of 11 segments, and each of these segments bears a pair of phyllopods. The abdomen has 9 segments and is limbless. Therefore, in a normal, untreated animal, the number of phyllopod-bearing segments is 11.\n\nNext, we analyze the effect of the experimental treatment. The RNAi treatment targets the *abd-A* gene. This gene is expressed in the 9 abdominal segments (segments 12 through 20) and its function is to repress limb development. The RNAi treatment aims to silence this gene.\n\nThe problem states that when *abd-A* is absent or silenced, the default developmental program for a segment is to become a thoracic-type segment and grow a pair of phyllopods. This means that any abdominal segment in which the RNAi successfully silences *abd-A* will develop phyllopods.\n\nThe experiment is conducted on the 9 abdominal segments. The efficiency of the RNAi treatment is given as 70.0%. This means that, on average, the *abd-A* gene will be silenced in 70.0% of the 9 target abdominal segments.\n\nWe can calculate the average number of abdominal segments that will be converted to a limb-bearing state.\nLet $N_{ab}$ be the number of abdominal segments, so $N_{ab} = 9$.\nLet $\\eta$ be the efficiency of the RNAi treatment, so $\\eta = 70.0\\% = 0.700$.\n\nThe average number of abdominal segments that will newly develop phyllopods, $\\Delta N_{phyllopod}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta N_{phyllopod} = N_{ab} \\times \\eta $$\n$$ \\Delta N_{phyllopod} = 9 \\times 0.700 = 6.30 $$\n\nNow, we can find the total average number of phyllopod-bearing segments per animal, $N_{total}$. This is the sum of the original phyllopod-bearing thoracic segments and the newly formed phyllopod-bearing abdominal segments.\nLet $N_{thorax}$ be the number of thoracic segments, so $N_{thorax} = 11$.\n\n$$ N_{total} = N_{thorax} + \\Delta N_{phyllopod} $$\n$$ N_{total} = 11 + 6.30 = 17.30 $$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is 17.30. The three significant figures are 1, 7, and 3. Therefore, the final answer is 17.3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{17.3}$$", "id": "1761919"}]}
