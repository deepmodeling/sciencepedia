This skill is the bedrock upon which a deeper understanding of plant life cycles is built.

This involves a cycle between a multicellular diploid ($2n$) sporophyte generation and a multicellular haploid ($n$) gametophyte generation. The ploidy level refers to the number of sets of chromosomes in a cell. Haploid cells ($n$) contain one set, while diploid cells ($2n$) contain two sets.\n\nConsider the life cycles of both angiosperms (flowering plants) and gymnosperms (e.g., conifers).

A nucleus within the growing pollen tube of an angiosperm is part of the male gametophyte (the pollen grain develops into the pollen tube). Both the tube (vegetative) nucleus and the generative/sperm nuclei are products of the haploid microspore and remain haploid. Therefore, the nucleus is $n$.\n\n2. An antipodal cell within the mature embryo sac of an angiosperm belongs to the female gametophyte (the embryo sac arises from mitoses of a single haploid megaspore). Thus all its cells (egg, synergids, antipodals, and the nuclei prior to fertilization) are haploid. Therefore, the antipodal cell is $n$.\n\n3. A cell from the seed coat of a mature pine seed (gymnosperm) is derived from the integument of the ovule, which is maternal sporophytic tissue. Sporophyte tissues are diploid.

This thought experiment focuses on a critical, and often misunderstood, aspect: how haploid gametes are produced from a haploid organism.

The haploid spore germinates into a haploid gametophyte, which then produces haploid gametes (sperm and eggs) via meiosis. Self-fertilization between these gametes forms a diploid zygote that develops into the sporophyte.\n\nB. The haploid spore germinates via mitosis into a bisexual, haploid gametophyte. This gametophyte produces both haploid sperm and haploid eggs via mitosis. Fertilization between these gametes on the same gametophyte creates a diploid zygote, which then develops into the sporophyte.\n\nC. The fern spore is diploid and germinates directly into a new diploid sporophyte through mitotic divisions, representing a form of asexual reproduction that bypasses the gametophyte generation.\n\nD.

Meiosis would halve ploidy and therefore occurs only in diploid tissue; haploid tissue cannot undergo meiosis to make gametes.\n\n4) Fertilization and development to sporophyte:\n- On a moist substrate, motile sperm from antheridia can swim to the archegonia on the same gametophyte (self-fertilization).\n- Fusion of haploid gametes ($n + n$) forms a diploid zygote, $2n$.\n- The zygote develops by mitosis (ploidy-preserving) into a new diploid sporophyte, $2n$.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A: Incorrect, because it claims the haploid gametophyte produces gametes via meiosis. Gametes in plants arise by mitosis from the haploid gametophyte; meiosis is restricted to the diploid sporophyte to make spores.\n- B: Correct. It states that the spore (haploid) germinates by mitosis into a bisexual haploid gametophyte, which produces haploid gametes via mitosis; self-fertilization on the same gametophyte yields a diploid zygote that develops into the sporophyte.\n- C: Incorrect. Fern spores are haploid, not diploid, and the life cycle does not skip the gametophyte generation in standard sexual reproduction.\n- D: Incorrect. A single spore need not asexually produce a second gametophyte; a single bisexual gametophyte can self-fertilize.
