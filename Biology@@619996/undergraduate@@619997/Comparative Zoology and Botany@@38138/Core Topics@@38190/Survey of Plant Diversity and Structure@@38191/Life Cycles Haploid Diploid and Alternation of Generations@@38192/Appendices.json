This practice problem focuses on the distinct ploidy levels found in different tissues of an angiosperm throughout its reproductive cycle. By determining the chromosome numbers in key structures like the pollen grain, seed coat, and endosperm, you will solidify your understanding of how meiosis and the unique process of double fertilization give rise to haploid ($n$), diploid ($2n$), and triploid ($3n$) tissues within a single organism's life history.

Through microscopic examination of root tip cells undergoing mitosis, the ecologist determines that the diploid chromosome number for this species' sporophyte is $2n=54$. The plant follows a typical alternation of generations with double fertilization. What are the respective chromosome numbers for a cell in the mature male gametophyte (the pollen grain), a cell in the seed coat (which develops from the maternal ovule's integuments), and a cell in the nutritive endosperm tissue within the seed?\n\nSelect the correct list of chromosome numbers corresponding to the pollen grain, seed coat, and endosperm, in that order.\n\nA. 27, 27, 54\n\nB. 54, 27, 81\n\nC. 27, 54, 54\n\nD. 27, 54, 81\n\nE. 54, 54, 108", "solution": "The sporophyte of the angiosperm has diploid chromosome number $2n=54$. Therefore the haploid number is obtained by dividing by $2$, giving $n=\\frac{2n}{2}=27$.\n\nA mature male gametophyte (pollen grain) is produced by meiosis and is haploid, so any cell in the pollen grain has $n$ chromosomes, which here is $n=27$.\n\nThe seed coat develops from the maternal ovule integuments, which are part of the maternal sporophyte.

This exercise shifts our focus to the world of mosses, which are characterized by a gametophyte-dominant life cycle where the main, leafy plant is haploid. You will compare the outcomes of both asexual and sexual reproduction in a moss, tracing the ploidy level and genotype of the resulting offspring. This practice is valuable for highlighting the diversity of life cycles in the plant kingdom and reinforcing the fundamental genetic differences between mitotic and meiotic pathways. [@problem_id:1753314]", "problem": "A botanist is investigating the life cycle of a species of moss, which exhibits alternation of generations between a haploid gametophyte and a diploid sporophyte. The botanist isolates a single female gametophyte and confirms through genetic analysis that it possesses the allele `R1` for a gene associated with rhizoid structure. This gametophyte then reproduces in two distinct ways.\n\nFirst, it undergoes asexual reproduction by forming a gemma, a small clump of cells that detaches and develops through mitosis into a new, independent moss plant, which we will call Plant A.\n\nSecond, sperm from a distant male moss plant, which possesses the allele `R2` for the same rhizoid gene, fertilizes an egg produced by the original female gametophyte. The resulting zygote develops into a mature sporophyte, which we will call Plant B. This sporophyte remains physically attached to the parent female gametophyte.\n\nBased on this scenario, what are the respective ploidy levels (haploid or diploid) and genotypes of Plant A and Plant B?\n\nA. Plant A is haploid with genotype `R1`; Plant B is diploid with genotype `R1 R2`.\n\nB. Plant A is haploid with genotype `R1`; Plant B is diploid with genotype `R1 R1`.\n\nC. Plant A is diploid with genotype `R1 R1`; Plant B is diploid with genotype `R1 R2`.\n\nD. Plant A is haploid with genotype `R1`; Plant B is haploid with genotype `R2`.\n\nE. Both Plant A and Plant B are diploid; Plant A has genotype `R1 R1` and Plant B has genotype `R1 R2`.", "solution": "In bryophytes such as mosses, there is alternation of generations: the gametophyte is haploid ($n$) and produces gametes, while the sporophyte is diploid ($2n$) and results from fertilization (syngamy).\n\nThe isolated female gametophyte is haploid and carries allele R1 at the rhizoid locus. Because it is haploid, every cell, including any gamete or vegetative propagule it produces, carries allele R1 at this locus unless mutation occurs (assumed absent here).\n\nFirst reproduction mode (asexual via gemma): A gemma forms by mitosis from the haploid gametophyte. Mitosis preserves both ploidy and genotype at the locus, so the resulting plant (Plant A) is a haploid ($n$) gametophyte with genotype R1.\n\nSecond reproduction mode (sexual via fertilization): The female gametophyte produces an egg by mitosis (gametes in haploid gametophytes are formed without meiosis and retain the same allele at the locus). Therefore, the egg carries allele R1. The sperm from a male gametophyte that carries allele R2 contributes allele R2. Fertilization combines these to form a diploid ($2n$) zygote with genotype R1 R2. This zygote develops into the sporophyte (Plant B), which remains attached to the gametophyte, as is characteristic for mosses.\n\nThus, Plant A is haploid with genotype R1, and Plant B is diploid with genotype R1 R2, matching option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1753314"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the rules of sexual reproduction also means appreciating the exceptions that illuminate the underlying principles. This exercise explores apomixis, a fascinating mode of asexual reproduction where viable seeds are produced without fertilization, a process observed in various plant species. Based on a hypothetical scenario involving the failure of meiosis (diplospory), you will deduce the genetic consequences for the resulting embryo. This practice challenges you to think critically about the roles of meiosis and gamete fusion, thereby deepening your understanding of why these processes are fundamental to generating genetic variation in most sexually reproducing organisms. [@problem_id:1753354]", "problem": "In most flowering plants (angiosperms), sexual reproduction involves a process called double fertilization. A diploid (2n) parent plant produces a haploid (n) embryo sac through meiosis. An egg cell within this sac is fertilized by one haploid sperm nucleus to form a diploid (2n) embryo, while the central cell is fertilized by another sperm nucleus to form a triploid (3n) endosperm, which serves as a nutritive tissue. The resulting embryo is genetically distinct from its parent.\n\nConsider a species of hawkweed that can reproduce via a specific type of apomixis known as diplospory. In this process, the diploid (2n) megaspore mother cell within the ovule fails to undergo meiosis and instead develops directly into a diploid (2n) embryo sac. An unfertilized egg cell within this diploid embryo sac then develops into a viable embryo through parthenogenesis.\n\nBased on this mechanism, what is the ploidy level and genetic relationship of the resulting embryo compared to the maternal parent plant?\n\nA. The embryo is haploid (n) and genetically identical to the parent plant.\n\nB. The embryo is diploid (2n) and genetically identical to the parent plant.\n\nC. The embryo is diploid (2n) and represents a new genetic combination, distinct from the parent plant.\n\nD. The embryo is triploid (3n) and genetically identical to the parent plant.\n\nE. The embryo is haploid (n) and represents a new genetic combination, distinct from the parent plant.", "solution": "We analyze the reproductive mechanism described: diplospory with parthenogenesis.\n\n1) State the baseline for sexual reproduction in angiosperms:\n- In typical sexual reproduction, the megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis to produce haploid ($n$) megaspores that give rise to a haploid ($n$) embryo sac. Fertilization combines a haploid egg ($n$) with a haploid sperm ($n$) to form a diploid ($2n$) zygote, introducing new genetic combinations through segregation and recombination during meiosis and the fusion of distinct gametes.\n\n2) Define diplospory:\n- In diplospory, the megaspore mother cell fails to undergo meiosis; therefore, there is no reduction in chromosome number and no meiotic recombination. Consequently, the embryo sac develops directly as diploid ($2n$), retaining the maternal genotype (barring somatic mutations).\n\n3) Identify the nature of the egg and its development:\n- Because the embryo sac is diploid ($2n$), the egg cell within it is also unreduced and diploid ($2n$).\n- Parthenogenesis means the embryo develops from the unfertilized egg, so there is no paternal genetic contribution.\n\n4) Deduce ploidy and genetic relationship:\n- Ploidy: The embryo develops from a diploid ($2n$) egg without fertilization, so the embryo remains diploid ($2n$).\n- Genetic relationship: With no meiosis (no segregation/recombination) and no fertilization (no paternal alleles), the embryo is genetically identical to the maternal parent plant.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is that the embryo is diploid and genetically identical to the parent plant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1753354"}]}
