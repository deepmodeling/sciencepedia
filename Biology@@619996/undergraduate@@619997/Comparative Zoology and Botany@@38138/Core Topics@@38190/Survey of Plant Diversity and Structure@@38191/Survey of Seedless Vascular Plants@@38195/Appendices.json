The slide contains both mature gametophytes (prothalli) and very young, recently developed sporophytes that are still attached to their parent gametophyte. To earn full credit, the student must correctly identify all the features from the list below that are exclusively characteristic of the mature gametophyte generation and not the sporophyte generation (at any stage of its development).

The mature gametophyte (prothallus) is a small, thin, photosynthetic, non-vascular body that arises directly from the germination of a single haploid spore (ploidy $n$). It bears the multicellular sex organs, antheridia (producing sperm) and archegonia (housing the egg). It is anchored to the substrate by rhizoids, which are simple, filamentous structures without vascular tissues. The sporophyte generation (ploidy $2n$) arises from the zygote retained within the archegonium on the gametophyte, grows into the dominant, vascular plant with true roots, stems, and leaves, and bears sporangia; it is photosynthetic and free-living in its mature form.\n\nEvaluate each option against features exclusive to the mature gametophyte and absent from the sporophyte at any stage.\n\nA. Photosynthetic and capable of independent, free-living existence is not exclusive to the gametophyte, because the sporophyte is also photosynthetic and free-living when mature. Therefore, A is not exclusively gametophytic.\n\nB. A dominant, multicellular body composed of diploid ($2n$) cells characterizes the sporophyte, not the gametophyte. Therefore, B is not gametophyte-exclusive.\n\nC. Bearing multicellular sex organs (archegonia and antheridia) is a defining feature of the gametophyte. The sporophyte bears sporangia, not sex organs. Therefore, C is exclusive to the mature gametophyte.\n\nD. Anchoring by simple, filamentous rhizoids is characteristic of the gametophyte. The sporophyte has true roots (and other vascular organs), not rhizoids. Therefore, D is exclusive to the mature gametophyte.\n\nE. Presence of specialized vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) is a feature of the sporophyte. The fern gametophyte is non-vascular. Therefore, E is not gametophyte-exclusive.\n\nF. Development directly from the germination of a haploid ($n$) spore defines the gametophyte in homosporous ferns. The sporophyte develops from a zygote within the archegonium.

You will act as a botanist, analyzing morphological evidence from two different specimens to determine if they are homosporous or heterosporous. This practice is crucial for recognizing heterospory, the evolutionary precursor to the seed habit [@problem_id:1777627].", "problem": "An undergraduate student in a comparative botany lab is tasked with examining two unidentified seedless vascular plant specimens, labeled Specimen A and Specimen B. The student records the following morphological observations.\n\n**Specimen A:** The specimen has large, pinnately compound leaves (fronds). On the abaxial (lower) surface of its fertile fronds, there are distinct, organized clusters of sporangia, known as sori. Microscopic inspection of several sori reveals that all the sporangia within are uniform in size and morphology. When mature, these sporangia release spores that are also indistinguishable from one another in size.\n\n**Specimen B:** The specimen is a small, herbaceous plant with simple, scale-like leaves arranged spirally on the stem. At the apex of the fertile branches, there are compact, cone-like structures called strobili. A careful dissection of a strobilus shows that it is composed of modified leaves (sporophylls), each bearing a single sporangium. Upon closer inspection, two types of sporangia are found within the same strobilus: larger sporangia (megasporangia) that contain a few large spores, and smaller sporangia (microsporangia) that contain a great number of minute spores.\n\nBased on these detailed observations, which of the following conclusions is the most accurate and correctly justified?\n\nA. Specimen A is heterosporous because its sporangia are aggregated into complex structures called sori.\n\nB. Specimen B is heterosporous because it produces two morphologically distinct types of spores in two different types of sporangia.\n\nC. Both Specimen A and Specimen B are homosporous because they both reproduce via spores instead of seeds.\n\nD. Specimen B is homosporous because all of its reproductive structures are contained within a single type of strobilus.\n\nE. Specimen A is heterosporous because its large fronds can support sporangia of different energy investments.", "solution": "Define the key terms. Homospory is the condition in which a plant produces one kind of spore; diagnostic observations include sporangia that are uniform in morphology and spores that are uniform in size, typically yielding bisexual or potentially bisexual gametophytes. Heterospory is the condition in which a plant produces two distinct kinds of spores: microspores (numerous, small) in microsporangia that give rise to male gametophytes, and megaspores (few, large) in megasporangia that give rise to female gametophytes. The presence or arrangement of sporangia into compound organs (such as sori or strobili) does not, by itself, determine homo- versus heterospory; rather, the decisive criterion is whether two discrete spore types are produced in distinct sporangia.\n\nApply these definitions to the observations.\n\nFor Specimen A: The plant bears sori on the abaxial surface of fertile fronds, and all sporangia within the sori are uniform in size and morphology; the released spores are indistinguishable in size. This satisfies the definition of homospory. The aggregation of sporangia into sori is a morphological feature typical of many ferns but does not imply heterospory. Therefore, any claim that Specimen A is heterosporous based on the presence of sori or frond size is incorrect.\n\nFor Specimen B: The plant bears strobili composed of sporophylls, each with a single sporangium, and within the same strobilus there are two sporangial types: megasporangia with a few large spores and microsporangia with many small spores. This matches the definition of heterospory. The fact that both sporangial types occur within a single strobilus does not negate heterospory; heterospory is defined by the production of two distinct spore types in distinct sporangia, irrespective of whether these sporangia are intermixed within one strobilus or segregated among separate strobili.\n\nEvaluate the answer choices against these conclusions.\n\nA is incorrect because the presence of sori does not define heterospory, and the uniform spores indicate homospory in Specimen A.\nB is correct because Specimen B produces two morphologically distinct spore types (microspores and megaspores) in two distinct sporangial types (microsporangia and megasporangia), which is the definition of heterospory.\nC is incorrect because both being spore-bearing does not imply both are homosporous; homospory versus heterospory concerns spore type diversity, not presence versus absence of seeds.\nD is incorrect because having all reproductive structures within a single strobilus does not imply homospory; the key is the presence of two distinct spore types, which are present in Specimen B.\nE is incorrect because frond size and hypothetical energy investment do not determine heterospory, and Specimen A shows uniform sporangia and spore size consistent with homospory.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and correctly justified conclusion is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1777627"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice integrates your knowledge of reproductive strategies with evolutionary analysis. Using a provided phylogenetic tree and the distribution of reproductive modes, you will apply the principle of parsimony to infer the evolutionary history of heterospory. This exercise demonstrates how scientists reconstruct the past, revealing patterns of trait evolution like independent origins or reversals across lineages [@problem_id:1777626].", "problem": "A botanist is investigating the evolution of reproductive strategies within the phylum Lycopodiophyta. After sequencing several key chloroplast genes, a phylogenetic tree is constructed for five representative taxa, labeled A, B, C, D, and E. The analysis also includes data on their reproductive mode, classifying each as either homosporous (producing one type of spore) or heterosporous (producing two types of spores: microspores and megaspores). The ancestral state for all vascular plants, including the common ancestor of these five taxa, is known to be homospory.\n\nThe relationships derived from the genetic data are as follows:\n- Taxon A is the most basal lineage, serving as an outgroup to the other four taxa.\n- Taxa B, C, D, and E form a monophyletic clade.\n- Within this clade, Taxon B is the earliest diverging lineage.\n- The remaining taxa (C, D, and E) form another monophyletic clade.\n- Within this latter clade, Taxon C is the outgroup to the sister taxa D and E.\n\nThe reproductive modes for these taxa are:\n- Taxon A: Homosporous\n- Taxon B: Heterosporous\n- Taxon C: Homosporous\n- Taxon D: Heterosporous\n- Taxon E: Heterosporous\n\nUsing the principle of parsimony, which seeks the simplest explanation requiring the fewest evolutionary events, determine the minimum total number of evolutionary steps required to explain the observed distribution of homospory and heterospory on this tree. An evolutionary step is defined as either a single gain of heterospory from a homosporous ancestor or a single loss of heterospory (a reversal to homospory) from a heterosporous ancestor.\n\nWhat is the minimum total number of steps?\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 3\n\nD. 4\n\nE. 5", "solution": "We encode the binary character as homospory $=0$ and heterospory $=1$.
