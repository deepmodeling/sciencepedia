This exercise challenges you to act as a botanist, connecting the specialized function of a plant tissue—such as a photosynthetic leaf versus a storage tuber—to the type of plastid you would expect to find. By predicting the outcomes of a classic staining procedure, you will sharpen your ability to interpret microscopic evidence and solidify your understanding of how structure dictates function at the cellular level [@problem_id:1768827].", "problem": "A botanist is investigating cellular differentiation and function in a newly discovered plant species. To do this, they prepare two different tissue samples for observation under a light microscope.\n\n- **Sample 1**: A thin cross-section is taken from the plant's primary storage organ, a non-photosynthetic tuber that grows underground.\n- **Sample 2**: A thin epidermal peel is taken from a mature leaf, which is the primary site of photosynthesis.\n\nBoth samples are mounted on separate slides and treated with Lugol's solution, an aqueous solution of iodine-potassium iodide that is commonly used as a biological stain. The botanist then observes the plastids within the cells of each sample.\n\nBased on the established functions of different plastid types in vascular plants, which of the following sets of observations and corresponding interpretations is the most scientifically sound?\n\nA. Cells in Sample 1 show numerous small, distinctly green organelles. Cells in Sample 2 contain large granules that stain a dark blue-black color. This suggests the tuber is specialized for photosynthesis and the leaf for long-term starch storage.\n\nB. Cells in both Sample 1 and Sample 2 show a uniform faint yellow-brown color throughout the cytoplasm, with no distinct, colored, or stained organelles visible. This indicates that this plant species lacks specialized plastids.\n\nC. Cells in Sample 1 contain numerous large, colorless organelles that stain a deep blue-black color with the addition of Lugol's solution. Cells in Sample 2 contain a high density of small, inherently green organelles that do not stain blue-black. This indicates the presence of amyloplasts in the tuber and chloroplasts in the leaf.\n\nD. Cells in Sample 1 are observed to be packed with organelles that stain a bright red color. Cells in Sample 2 contain organelles that remain colorless even after staining. This implies that the tuber contains chromoplasts for signaling, and the leaf uses a non-plastid-based mechanism for photosynthesis.\n\nE. Cells in both Sample 1 and Sample 2 contain an abundance of large organelles that stain deep blue-black. This indicates that both the leaf and the tuber are equally specialized for long-term, high-capacity starch storage.", "solution": "The task is to match expected plastid types and Lugol’s iodine staining behavior with the tissue sources and observations.\n\nFundamental principles:\n1) Plastids differentiate by function:\n- Chloroplasts are photosynthetic plastids containing chlorophyll; they are inherently green and typical of photosynthetic tissues such as leaves.\n- Amyloplasts are non-pigmented storage plastids specialized for starch accumulation; they are typical of storage organs such as tubers.\n- Chromoplasts contain carotenoid pigments (red, orange, yellow) and are typically found in petals and fruits used for signaling, not in underground storage organs.\n\n2) Lugol’s iodine-potassium iodide solution stains starch by forming a polyiodide-amylose complex that appears dark blue-black. Therefore:\n- Organelles rich in starch (amyloplasts) will show blue-black staining.\n- Chloroplasts, while they can transiently contain starch grains, are identified by their inherent green color due to chlorophyll; their defining feature is photosynthetic pigment, not blue-black staining. In general, the expectation in an epidermal peel is to observe chloroplasts in guard cells and minimal starch storage compared to a tuber.\n\nAssessment of options against these principles:\n- Option A: Sample 1 (tuber) with numerous small green organelles implies chloroplasts in a non-photosynthetic, underground organ, which is inconsistent. Sample 2 (leaf epidermis) with large blue-black granules implies major starch storage specialization in the leaf epidermis, which is not the primary function; this interpretation is incorrect.\n- Option B: Uniform faint yellow-brown with no distinct organelles and the conclusion that the species lacks specialized plastids contradicts the universal presence of plastids in vascular plants; also Lugol’s typically reveals starch in a tuber.\n- Option C: Sample 1 (tuber) shows large, colorless organelles staining deep blue-black with Lugol’s, matching amyloplasts. Sample 2 (leaf) shows many small, inherently green organelles that do not stain blue-black, matching chloroplasts. The interpretation (amyloplasts in tuber, chloroplasts in leaf) is scientifically sound.\n- Option D: Bright red-staining organelles in an underground tuber suggests chromoplasts, which is atypical for non-photosynthetic storage organs; moreover, asserting a non-plastid-based mechanism for photosynthesis is incorrect since photosynthesis in plants occurs in chloroplasts.\n- Option E: Both samples with abundant blue-black staining implying equal specialization for long-term starch storage contradicts the primary roles of leaves (photosynthesis) and tubers (storage), and is especially unlikely for a leaf epidermal peel.\n\nTherefore, the only option that aligns with established plastid functions and Lugol’s staining behavior is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1768827"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their metabolic roles, plastids can also act as physical sensors. This practice delves into the \"statolith-starch\" hypothesis of gravitropism, where dense amyloplasts are thought to signal the direction of gravity by settling within the cell. You will apply fundamental principles of physics to calculate the minute, yet significant, force that a single amyloplast exerts, providing a tangible sense of the biomechanical interactions that govern plant growth and orientation [@problem_id:1768774].", "problem": "The gravitropic response in plant roots, which directs their growth in alignment with the gravitational field, is primarily mediated by specialized cells in the root cap called columella cells. The prevailing \"statolith-starch\" hypothesis posits that dense, starch-filled amyloplasts, acting as statoliths, sediment within the cytoplasm of these cells. This sedimentation process is thought to culminate in the amyloplasts pressing against the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating mechanosensitive ion channels and initiating a signaling cascade that leads to differential growth.\n\nTo explore the physical basis of this hypothesis, model a single columella cell where a spherical amyloplast sediments through the cytoplasm, which is treated as a Newtonian fluid. The amyloplast eventually comes to rest upon the ER, which is distributed near the cell floor. Your task is to calculate the magnitude of the steady-state force exerted by one such amyloplast on the underlying ER membrane after it has fully settled.\n\nUse the following parameters for your calculation:\n- Radius of the spherical amyloplast, $r_a = 2.00 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$\n- Density of the amyloplast, $\\rho_a = 1.55 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3$\n- Density of the surrounding cytoplasm, $\\rho_c = 1.04 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3$\n- Viscosity of the cytoplasm, $\\eta = 8.50 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}$\n- Acceleration due to gravity, $g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$\n\nExpress your final answer for the force in piconewtons (pN).
