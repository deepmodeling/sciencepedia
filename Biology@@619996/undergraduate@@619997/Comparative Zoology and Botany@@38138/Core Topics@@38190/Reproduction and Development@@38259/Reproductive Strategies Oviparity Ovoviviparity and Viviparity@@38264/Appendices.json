This practice problem places you in the role of a conservation biologist to quantitatively compare these strategies. By calculating the net number of surviving offspring for two hypothetical lizard species, you will explore how environmental pressures, such as predation, can determine the most advantageous reproductive mode [@problem_id:1773098].", "problem": "A conservation team is tasked with establishing a new population of lizards on a remote island sanctuary. The primary challenge on this island is a high density of native, ground-foraging birds that are aggressive nest predators. The team has two closely related candidate species, *Gekkolis oviparus* and *Gekkolis vivanus*, which are ecologically identical in all aspects except for their reproductive strategy. The team has collected the following averaged reproductive data from mainland populations for a single reproductive season per female:\n\n** *Gekkolis oviparus* (Oviparous - egg-laying):**\n- Average clutch size: 10 eggs\n- On-island projected egg survival to hatching (accounting for nest predation): 15%\n- Post-hatching survival of an individual to one year of age: 50%\n\n** *Gekkolis vivanus* (Viviparous - live-bearing):**\n- Average litter size: 4 young\n- Post-birth survival of an individual to one year of age: 80%\n\nTo maximize the chance of successful population establishment, the team should select the species with the greater number of offspring expected to survive to one year of age per female. Based on the data provided, which species should be introduced and why?\n\nA. *Gekkolis oviparus*, because its significantly larger clutch size results in a greater absolute number of offspring being produced initially, which is the most critical factor for colonization.\n\nB. *Gekkolis vivanus*, because its viviparous strategy allows it to entirely bypass the main environmental challenge of nest predation, guaranteeing its success over the egg-laying species.\n\nC. *Gekkolis vivanus*, because despite having a smaller litter, the higher survival rate of its young leads to a greater net number of offspring surviving to one year per female.\n\nD. *Gekkolis oviparus*, because the energetic demands of live birth on *Gekkolis vivanus* females likely reduce their own survival, making the overall population less resilient than the egg-laying species.\n\nE. The two species are equally suitable, as the high fecundity of *Gekkolis oviparus* is effectively balanced by the higher offspring survivorship of *Gekkolis vivanus*, leading to nearly identical net reproductive outcomes.", "solution": "Goal: choose the species with the greater expected number of offspring per female surviving to one year, given the stage-specific survivals. Principle: expected survivors across sequential stages multiply, i.e., expected survivors equals initial number produced times survival probabilities at each subsequent stage, assuming stage-wise independence.\n\nFor Gekkolis oviparus (egg-laying), define clutch size $N_{o}=10$, egg-to-hatching survival $s_{\\text{egg}\\to\\text{hatch}}=0.15=\\frac{3}{20}$, and post-hatching survival to one year $s_{\\text{hatch}\\to 1\\text{yr}}=0.50=\\frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, despite the smaller litter, its higher survival produces a greater net number of yearlings, which best maximizes establishment probability. This corresponds to option C. Options A, B, D, and E are not supported: A focuses on initial fecundity rather than net survivors; B asserts an unwarranted guarantee; D invokes unprovided assumptions about maternal costs; E is false given the computed expectations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1773098"}, {"introduction": "Large-scale evolutionary transitions do not happen in a single leap but through a sequence of smaller, advantageous steps. This thought experiment challenges you to reconstruct the most plausible evolutionary pathway from oviparity with external fertilization to ovoviviparity with internal fertilization. Evaluating the selective logic of each step will sharpen your understanding of how complex adaptations arise over time [@problem_id:1773087].", "problem": "In a hypothetical lineage of ancient fish, the ancestral condition is oviparity with external fertilization. In this mode, females release a large number of small, yolk-poor eggs into the water, and males release clouds of sperm nearby. Fertilization and development occur in the open water. Over evolutionary time, this lineage transitions to ovoviviparity with internal fertilization, where females give birth to live, well-developed young that hatched from eggs retained within the mother's body, nourished only by their own yolk sac. This evolutionary shift occurred in an environment with significant predation pressure on both free-floating gametes and externally developing eggs.\n\nWhich of the following sequences represents the most evolutionarily plausible series of major adaptations that would lead this lineage from external fertilization and oviparity to internal fertilization and ovoviviparity?\n\nA. (i) Females evolve the capacity to retain unfertilized eggs within their reproductive tract for protection. (ii) Males evolve a copulatory organ to deliver sperm internally to fertilize these retained eggs. (iii) The yolk content per egg increases to support longer development.\n\nB. (i) A mutation causes a drastic reduction in the number of eggs produced, making each individual egg more \"valuable\". (ii) To ensure the fertilization of these few valuable eggs, males evolve a copulatory organ for internal sperm transfer. (iii) To protect the fertilized eggs, females evolve to retain them internally until hatching.\n\nC. (i) Males evolve a copulatory organ (an intromittent organ) for internal sperm delivery. (ii) With fertilization now more certain, selection favors females who produce fewer, larger eggs with more yolk. (iii) Females evolve the capacity to retain these fertilized eggs internally through development, protecting them from predation.\n\nD. (i) To provide better nourishment, a primitive placenta-like tissue evolves, allowing nutrient transfer from the mother to the eggs within her body. (ii) Internal fertilization evolves to ensure sperm can reach these internally-developing eggs. (iii) The egg's own yolk supply diminishes as the reliance on maternal nutrients increases.", "solution": "Ancestral condition: external fertilization and oviparity with many small, yolk-poor eggs released into open water. In an environment with high predation on both free gametes and externally developing eggs, selection will first favor traits that increase the probability that sperm meet eggs and that embryos avoid external predation.\n\nLogical pathway under natural selection:\n1) Ensuring fertilization under predation pressure. When free gametes are heavily preyed upon, the most direct way to increase fertilization success is to move fertilization into the female reproductive tract. In fishes, this commonly occurs via the evolution of a male intromittent organ (e.g., claspers, gonopodium) that permits internal sperm transfer. This step directly addresses predation on gametes by removing them from the open water column at the time of fertilization.\n2) Shift in egg size-number trade-off once fertilization is more certain. With internal fertilization, the variance and uncertainty of fertilization decrease; carrying embryos imposes spatial and energetic constraints within the female, favoring fewer, larger eggs with more yolk. This increases per-embryo survival probability during longer internal development, consistent with selection on the egg size-number trade-off toward increased investment per offspring when offspring are better protected and maternal carrying capacity is limited.\n3) Evolution of egg retention leading to ovoviviparity. After fertilization occurs internally and eggs are larger and yolk-richer, selection favors females that retain the fertilized eggs in the reproductive tract until hatching, thereby reducing predation risk on externally developing eggs. This completes the transition to ovoviviparity, where embryos are nourished only by yolk (no maternal provisioning), and birth is of live, well-developed young.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A places egg retention of unfertilized eggs before internal fertilization. Retaining unfertilized eggs provides little benefit if sperm still must meet eggs externally; without a way for sperm to reach retained eggs, this step is maladaptive or neutral at best. Only after internal sperm delivery would retention be advantageous.\n- B begins with a drastic reduction in egg number under external fertilization. With high predation on gametes and external embryos, reducing fecundity first would sharply reduce fitness; there is no mechanism yet to ensure those few eggs are fertilized or protected, making this sequence implausible as an initial step.\n- C starts with the evolution of a male intromittent organ enabling internal fertilization, then favors fewer, larger, more yolk-rich eggs, and finally evolves female retention of fertilized eggs until hatching. This sequence directly addresses the selective pressures in the stated environment and matches the known order of trait evolution in many lineages transitioning to internal fertilization and ovoviviparity.\n- D posits a placenta-like maternal provisioning first and a reduction in yolk, which characterizes viviparity with matrotrophy, not ovoviviparity. It also reverses the likely order by adding maternal provisioning before internal fertilization and retention are established.\n\nTherefore, the most evolutionarily plausible sequence is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1773087"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary history is written not only in fossils but also in an organism's DNA. When a biological function is lost, the genes that coded for it are no longer conserved by selection and begin to accumulate mutations, acting as a \"molecular clock\". In this problem, you will use this principle to date the evolutionary shift to viviparity in a lizard lineage by analyzing a defunct eggshell gene, providing a window into the deep past [@problem_id:1773073].", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is studying the transition from oviparity (egg-laying) to viviparity (live-birth) in a lineage of lizards. They focus on two closely related species: *Sceloporus ovifer*, which is oviparous, and *Sceloporus viviparus*, which is viviparous. The transition to viviparity renders genes for eggshell formation obsolete, leading to their degradation into pseudogenes through neutral mutation accumulation.\n\nThe biologists analyze a gene named *Ovocleidin-17* (OC-17), which codes for a crucial protein in the formation of the hard, calcareous eggshell. The gene is fully functional in *S. ovifer*. In *S. viviparus*, the corresponding gene has become a non-functional pseudogene.\n\nGenetic sequencing provides the following data:\n- The length of the functional *OC-17* coding sequence in *S. ovifer* is $L = 750$ base pairs.\n- A comparison between the functional *OC-17* gene in *S. ovifer* and the *OC-17* pseudogene in *S. viviparus* reveals a total of $D = 24$ nucleotide substitutions.\n- Based on analysis of neutrally evolving regions across the genome (like four-fold degenerate sites and introns), the background rate of neutral substitution for this lizard lineage is determined to be $\\mu = 1.6 \\times 10^{-9}$ substitutions per site per year.\n\nAssume that before the evolutionary transition to viviparity, the *OC-17* gene was under strong purifying selection, which prevented any substitutions from becoming fixed. After the transition, the selective pressure was completely relaxed, and the gene began accumulating substitutions at the neutral rate, $\\mu$.\n\nBased on this information, estimate the time that has passed since the *OC-17* gene lost its function in the lineage leading to *S. viviparus*. This time serves as a molecular estimate for when the transition to viviparity occurred. Express your answer in millions of years (Myr). Round your final answer to two significant figures.", "solution": "We are comparing the functional gene in the oviparous species to a pseudogene in the viviparous species. By assumption, before loss of function the gene was under strong purifying selection (no fixed substitutions), and after loss of function the pseudogene in the viviparous lineage accumulated substitutions at the neutral rate. The oviparous lineage remains constrained, so observed differences are attributed to the neutral accumulation in the pseudogene lineage only. Therefore, the expected number of substitutions is\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[D]=\\mu L t,\n$$\nwhere $L$ is the sequence length, $\\mu$ is the neutral substitution rate per site per year, and $t$ is the time since loss of function (years).
