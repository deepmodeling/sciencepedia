This process can mask the effects of harmful recessive alleles, a phenomenon that stands in stark contrast to self-fertilization, which often leads to inbreeding depression.

By working through this model, you will gain a concrete understanding of why selection often favors mechanisms that promote outcrossing over selfing.", "problem": "Consider a large population of a hermaphroditic plant species that is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A single gene with two alleles, a dominant allele $A$ and a recessive allele $a$, controls a specific physiological trait. The presence of the homozygous recessive genotype ($aa$) leads to a deleterious, though non-lethal, condition. The frequency of the recessive allele $a$ in the population's gene pool is denoted by $q$, where $0 < q < 1$.\n\nAn individual plant from this population can reproduce in two ways: by self-fertilization or by outcrossing with a randomly selected plant from the same population.\n\nWe are interested in comparing the likelihood of producing an offspring with the deleterious condition under these two reproductive strategies. Let $P_{\\text{self}}$ be the average probability that an offspring produced by self-fertilization will have the $aa$ genotype, where the average is taken over all possible parental genotypes in the population according to their frequencies.

For hermaphroditic species, a fundamental trade-off exists between investing in male function (e.g., pollen) and female function (e.g., ovules). This practice [@problem_id:1773865] challenges you to step into the role of an evolutionary modeler, using optimization principles to determine the ideal energy allocation for a hypothetical wind-pollinated plant. This problem beautifully illustrates how natural selection sculpts reproductive strategies to find a balance between competing demands.", "problem": "A botanist is modeling the reproductive strategy of a hypothetical wind-pollinated plant, *Aetheria graminis*. The plant has a fixed total energy budget for reproduction in a given season. It must allocate this energy between producing pollen (male function) and producing ovules (female function). Let $p$ be the fraction of the reproductive energy budget allocated to pollen production, where $0 \\le p \\le 1$. Consequently, the fraction of energy allocated to ovule production is $(1-p)$.\n\nThe model makes the following assumptions based on the plant's biology:\n1.  The total number of ovules the plant produces is directly proportional to the energy invested in them. Thus, the number of ovules can be written as $N_{\\text{ovules}} = C(1-p)$, where $C$ is a positive constant representing the maximum possible number of ovules.\n2.  The probability of any single one of its ovules being successfully pollinated depends on the amount of pollen it produces.

Determine the optimal fraction of energy, $p_{opt}$, that the plant should allocate to pollen production to maximize its seasonal reproductive success. Your answer should be expressed as an analytical expression in terms of $\\alpha$.", "solution": "The plant’s seasonal reproductive success (fitness) is proportional to the total number of its ovules that are successfully pollinated, which is the product of the number of ovules and the probability of pollination of a single ovule.
