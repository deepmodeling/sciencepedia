This practice problem challenges you to apply your knowledge of the distinct EC coupling mechanisms in cardiac and skeletal muscle to predict the effects of a specific drug [@problem_id:1731307]. By working through this pharmacological scenario, you will solidify your understanding of why these two striated muscles, despite their similar appearances, respond differently to calcium signaling.", "problem": "A pharmacologist is developing a new drug, \"Cardiostatin,\" intended to treat certain cardiac arrhythmias by reducing the force of heart muscle contraction. The drug's mechanism of action is a highly specific blockage of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which are a key component in the process of Excitation-Contraction (EC) coupling in muscle cells. To assess the drug's specificity and potential side effects, the pharmacologist designs an experiment using isolated, viable preparations of ventricular cardiac muscle and fast-twitch skeletal muscle from the same vertebrate species.\n\nBoth muscle preparations are placed in separate baths containing a physiological saline solution and are stimulated electrically to produce maximal, consistent contractions. After establishing a stable baseline of contractile force for both tissues, a therapeutic concentration of Cardiostatin is added to each bath.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of EC coupling in these two distinct muscle types, predict the most likely effect of Cardiostatin on the contractile force generated by the cardiac muscle and the skeletal muscle preparations.\n\nA. Contractility will be significantly reduced in both cardiac and skeletal muscle.\n\nB. Contractility will be significantly reduced in cardiac muscle, but largely unaffected in skeletal muscle.\n\nC. Contractility will be largely unaffected in cardiac muscle, but significantly reduced in skeletal muscle.\n\nD. Contractility will be largely unaffected in both cardiac and skeletal muscle.\n\nE. Contractility will be significantly increased in cardiac muscle, and largely unaffected in skeletal muscle.", "solution": "Cardiostatin is specified to block L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The effect on contractility depends on how L-type channels contribute to excitation-contraction coupling in each muscle type.\n\nIn ventricular cardiac muscle, depolarization during the action potential opens L-type channels in the T-tubule membrane, producing an inward calcium current that provides the trigger calcium required for calcium-induced calcium release from ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This L-type calcium influx is necessary to initiate substantial sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release. Blocking L-type channels therefore reduces or abolishes the trigger calcium, leading to a marked decrease in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, a reduction in cytosolic calcium binding to troponin C, fewer cross-bridge interactions, and thus a significant reduction in developed force.\n\nIn fast-twitch skeletal muscle, the dihydropyridine receptor (the L-type channel) functions primarily as a voltage sensor mechanically coupled to ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The coupling between the dihydropyridine receptor and ryanodine receptor in skeletal muscle enables sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release to be triggered by the conformational change of the voltage sensor without requiring calcium influx through the L-type channel pore. Therefore, blockade of the L-type channel’s ion conduction does not materially impair the voltage-sensor function, and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release—and thus contractile force—remains largely unchanged under typical conditions.\n\nConsequently, the expected outcome is a significant reduction in cardiac muscle contractility and little to no change in fast-twitch skeletal muscle contractility. The correct choice is that contractility will be significantly reduced in cardiac muscle, but largely unaffected in skeletal muscle.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1731307"}, {"introduction": "A single hormone can trigger opposite outcomes in different parts of the body, a testament to the specificity of cellular signaling. This exercise explores how epinephrine, the ‘fight-or-flight’ hormone, can cause smooth muscle to either contract or relax depending on its location [@problem_id:1731316]. This case study is crucial for appreciating how diverse receptor subtypes and intracellular pathways, such as the $IP_3/\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\\text{cAMP}$ pathways, allow for nuanced physiological control.", "problem": "During a classic \"fight-or-flight\" response, an animal's adrenal gland releases the hormone epinephrine into the bloodstream. This single hormone coordinates a complex physiological response by acting on smooth muscle in various organs. Two observed effects are the constriction of small arteries (arterioles) that supply blood to the digestive system and the relaxation of the smooth muscle lining the airways (bronchioles). These differential responses are possible because epinephrine binds to different subtypes of adrenergic receptors, which in turn activate distinct intracellular signaling pathways.\n\nAssume there are two primary signaling cascades involved:\n1.  The **$\\text{cAMP}$ pathway**: Activation of this pathway leads to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate ($\\text{cAMP}$), which generally promotes smooth muscle relaxation.\n2.  The **$IP_3/\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ pathway**: Activation of this pathway involves the Gq protein and Phospholipase C (PLC), leading to the generation of inositol trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and a subsequent increase in intracellular calcium ion ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$) concentration, which generally triggers smooth muscle contraction.\n\nThe main adrenergic receptor subtypes on these tissues are $\\alpha_1$-receptors and $\\beta_2$-receptors.

Smooth > Skeletal > Cardiac; because smooth muscle has the simplest structure, allowing it to function for long periods without the complex energy demands of striated muscle.", "solution": "Fatigue resistance is the ability to sustain force over time without a significant decline in performance, which depends on the balance between $\\text{ATP}$ demand during cross-bridge cycling and the efficiency and capacity of $\\text{ATP}$ supply. Let the $\\text{ATP}$ demand rate be denoted by $\\dot{n}_{\\text{ATP}}$ and the sustainable $\\text{ATP}$ supply rate by $\\dot{n}_{\\text{ATP,supply}}$. High fatigue resistance corresponds to a small ratio $\\dot{n}_{\\text{ATP}}/\\dot{n}_{\\text{ATP,supply}}$ during the required mechanical task.\n\nSmooth muscle exhibits very high fatigue resistance because it uses the latch-bridge mechanism: after myosin light chain dephosphorylation, cross-bridges can remain attached with greatly reduced cycling, so $\\dot{n}_{\\text{ATP}}$ is very low for a given maintained force. Smooth muscle myosin ATPase activity is slow, and tonic contractions can be maintained with minimal $\\text{ATP}$ turnover, making sustained tone highly economical.\n\nCardiac muscle has high fatigue resistance due to a very high oxidative capacity: it has a high mitochondrial density, abundant myoglobin, rich capillary supply, and relies predominantly on aerobic metabolism with a large and continuous $\\dot{n}_{\\text{ATP,supply}}$ matched to its demand. Although its $\\text{ATP}$ turnover is continuous and substantial, its oxidative machinery supports ongoing activity with minimal fatigue under physiological conditions. However, it lacks a latch state and its cross-bridge cycling remains relatively faster than smooth muscle during each beat, so for sustained force maintenance, it is less $\\text{ATP}$-economical than smooth muscle.\n\nSkeletal muscle as a tissue class is least fatigue-resistant because it comprises a mix of fiber types: type I (slow oxidative) fibers are relatively fatigue-resistant, but type IIx (fast glycolytic) fibers fatigue quickly due to high $\\dot{n}_{\\text{ATP}}$ and limited oxidative capacity, relying on anaerobic glycolysis and exhibiting faster metabolite accumulation and glycogen depletion. Thus, when considering skeletal muscle broadly, it includes easily fatigable components and demonstrates lower overall fatigue resistance than smooth or cardiac muscle.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: voluntary control and training do not make skeletal muscle more fatigue-resistant than cardiac or smooth muscle; the ranking is wrong.\n- B is incorrect: while the heart must beat continuously, smooth muscle’s latch mechanism yields greater $\\text{ATP}$ economy for sustained tone, and skeletal should not outrank smooth.\n- C is correct: Smooth $>$ Cardiac $>$ Skeletal, with accurate justifications (latch-bridge $\\text{ATP}$ efficiency for smooth, high oxidative capacity for cardiac, mixed and often anaerobic fast-fatigable fibers in skeletal).\n- D is incorrect: maximal force does not imply fatigue resistance; the ranking is wrong.\n- E is incorrect: “simplest structure” is not a valid physiological basis, and the ranking is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1731323"}]}
