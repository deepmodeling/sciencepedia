While the cells are the bricks, what serves as the mortar, especially in a tissue that must withstand constant physical force? This practice explores the cellular \"rivets,\" known as desmosomes, that grant tissues like skin their remarkable mechanical strength. This exercise challenges you to diagnose the direct consequences of selectively breaking these connections, helping to clarify the specific function of desmosomes in maintaining the integrity of stratified epithelia. [@problem_id:1730257]", "problem": "An animal is exposed to a newly discovered aquatic bacterium that produces an exotoxin. Laboratory analysis reveals that this toxin is a highly specific protease that exclusively targets and degrades the cadherin proteins (desmoglein and desmocollin) that constitute the core of desmosomes. This bacterium colonizes the animal's skin, which is a classic example of a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Assuming the toxin diffuses through the outer layers and becomes active throughout the epithelium, which of the following choices describes the most direct and immediate pathological consequence for the affected tissue?\n\nA. The epithelial cells will lose their apical-basal polarity, disrupting the organized layering of the tissue.\n\nB. The selective barrier function of the epithelium will be lost, allowing for uncontrolled leakage of interstitial fluid and solutes between the cells.\n\nC. Communication and metabolic coupling between adjacent epithelial cells via the passage of small ions and signaling molecules will be terminated.\n\nD. The epithelial cells will lose their strong adhesion to one another, leading to the separation of cells and the formation of intraepithelial blisters under mechanical stress.\n\nE. The entire epithelial sheet will detach from the underlying basement membrane, leading to a complete sloughing off of the skin.", "solution": "Identify the molecular target: the toxin is a protease specific for cadherins that form desmosomes in epithelia, namely desmoglein and desmocollin. These are the transmembrane adhesion molecules that mediate cell-cell adhesion in desmosomes by homophilic interactions and link to intermediate filaments via plakoglobin and desmoplakin, conferring mechanical strength.\n\nState the physiological role of desmosomes: desmosomes are spot-like intercellular junctions that provide strong mechanical coupling between epithelial cells, especially in stratified squamous epithelia such as skin. They are critical for withstanding shear and tensile forces. Loss of desmosomal function leads to acantholysis (loss of cohesion between keratinocytes) and intraepithelial blister formation.\n\nMap each option to the corresponding junctional complex and consequence:\n- Option A (loss of apical-basal polarity) primarily involves adherens junctions and polarity complexes (e.g., cadherin-catenin complexes at zonula adherens and Par/Crumbs/Scribble complexes), not desmosomes.\n- Option B (loss of selective barrier function with paracellular leakage) is a function of tight junctions (zonula occludens), composed of claudins and occludin, not desmosomes.\n- Option C (loss of intercellular communication via small ions and signaling molecules) is mediated by gap junctions formed by connexins, not desmosomes.\n- Option D (loss of strong adhesion between epithelial cells leading to separation and intraepithelial blisters under mechanical stress) is the direct consequence of desmosome disruption, as seen pathophysiologically in conditions like pemphigus where desmoglein function is impaired.\n- Option E (detachment of the epithelial sheet from the basement membrane) reflects failure of hemidesmosomes and integrin-mediated adhesion to the basal lamina components (e.g., laminin 332), not desmosomes.\n\nConclude the direct and immediate consequence: selective proteolysis of desmoglein and desmocollin abolishes desmosomal adhesion, causing loss of intercellular cohesion in the epithelium and intraepithelial blistering under stress.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1730257"}, {"introduction": "If desmosomes provide mechanical strength, other junctions, known as tight junctions, serve as the selective sealant that controls what passes between cells. In absorptive epithelia, this barrier function is paramount, creating a tightly regulated gate that dictates the path of nutrients and fluids. This comparative problem asks you to predict the functional outcome when this sealant is compromised in a simple absorptive tissue versus a stratified protective one, sharpening your understanding of how cellular architecture is tailored to specific physiological demands. [@problem_id:1730218]", "problem": "A team of marine biologists is studying a newly discovered species of sea sponge that produces a potent compound, named Poriferatoxin-C. Laboratory analysis reveals that this toxin selectively and rapidly inactivates claudin proteins in vertebrate tissues by preventing their polymerization. Claudin proteins are the primary structural components of tight junctions, which act as a selective barrier by regulating the passage of molecules and ions through the space between cells (the paracellular pathway).\n\nConsider two distinct types of epithelial tissues exposed to a physiologically relevant dose of Poriferataxin-C:\n1.  A simple columnar absorptive epithelium, whose primary function is the selective transport of nutrients from a lumen into the bloodstream.\n2.  A non-keratinized stratified squamous protective epithelium, whose primary function is to protect underlying tissues from mechanical abrasion.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the immediate primary consequence for the function of these two tissues?\n\nA. The stratified squamous epithelium would be more severely affected, as the loss of cell-cell adhesion would cause the multiple layers to immediately slough off, completely compromising its protective barrier.\n\nB. The simple columnar epithelium would suffer a catastrophic failure of function due to uncontrolled paracellular leakage, while the stratified squamous epithelium's primary protective function against abrasion would remain largely intact.\n\nC. Both tissues would be equally and catastrophically affected, as the disruption of tight junctions would lead to a complete loss of tissue integrity and massive, immediate cell death in both.\n\nD. The function of the simple columnar epithelium would be largely unaffected because its primary absorptive role relies on transcellular transport (through the cells), not paracellular transport (between the cells).\n\nE. The stratified squamous epithelium would begin to uncontrollably secrete mucus, while the simple columnar epithelium would lose its ability to absorb water but not solutes.", "solution": "Poriferatoxin-C inactivates claudins, which are the principal polymerizing components of tight junction strands. Tight junctions (zonulae occludentes) function to:\n1) seal the paracellular pathway to regulate ion and solute permeability across epithelia, thereby generating high transepithelial resistance; and\n2) maintain epithelial polarity by restricting lateral diffusion of membrane proteins between apical and basolateral domains. Preventing claudin polymerization acutely disrupts these tight junction functions, increasing paracellular permeability and compromising polarity.\n\nIn a simple columnar absorptive epithelium, the primary physiological transport is transcellular via apical and basolateral transporters and channels; however, the integrity of this transcellular absorption critically depends on tight junctions to:\na) prevent back-leak of absorbed solutes and water through the paracellular route,\nb) maintain the steep electrochemical gradients that drive secondary active transport, and\nc) preserve apical-basal polarity necessary for vectorial transport.\nAcute claudin disruption would therefore cause uncontrolled paracellular leak, collapse of transepithelial gradients, and loss of vectorial transport. The immediate primary consequence is a severe, effectively catastrophic failure of absorptive function.\n\nIn a non-keratinized stratified squamous protective epithelium, the primary function is mechanical protection against abrasion. Cohesion and mechanical integrity are mediated predominantly by desmosomes and adherens junctions, with tight junctions being sparse or limited to superficial cells and not forming a continuous circumferential belt across multiple layers. Acute loss of claudin-based tight junctions increases paracellular permeability but does not abolish desmosomal adhesion; thus, there is no immediate sloughing of layers, and the mechanical protective function remains largely intact in the short term.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because loss of tight junctions does not eliminate the desmosomal adhesion that holds stratified layers together; immediate sloughing is unlikely.\n- B is correct: simple columnar absorptive epithelium exhibits catastrophic functional failure due to uncontrolled paracellular leak, whereas the stratified squamous epithelium retains its primary protective role.\n- C is incorrect because tight junction disruption does not cause equal, immediate loss of tissue integrity or massive cell death in both tissues.\n- D is incorrect because, although absorption is transcellular, it depends on tight junctions to prevent paracellular back-leak and maintain polarity.\n- E is incorrect because non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium is not characterized by uncontrolled mucus secretion under tight junction disruption, and the water-versus-solute absorption distinction given for simple columnar is unfounded here.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1730218"}, {"introduction": "Beyond forming barriers and protective layers, epithelial cells assemble into complex glands designed for secretion.
