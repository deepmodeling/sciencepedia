The parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are coefficients related to the worm's method of locomotion, which relies on its hydrostatic skeleton. From a detailed analysis of the worm's movement, $\\alpha$ is found to be a dimensionless shape factor, while $\\beta$ is a characteristic length related to the mechanics of friction generation.
