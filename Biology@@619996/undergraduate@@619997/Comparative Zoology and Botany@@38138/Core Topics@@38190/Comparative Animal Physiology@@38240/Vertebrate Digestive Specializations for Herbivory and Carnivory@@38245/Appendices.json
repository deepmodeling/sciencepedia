This first exercise allows you to quantify this principle directly by comparing the gut mass of two primates with different herbivorous diets: a leaf-eating folivore and a fruit-eating frugivore. By considering hypothetical animals of the same total body mass, this problem isolates the impact of diet on the relative investment in digestive tissues [@problem_id:1783214].", "problem": "A comparative zoologist is investigating the relationship between diet and digestive system morphology in primates. The study focuses on two herbivorous species with distinct feeding strategies: the Bornean orangutan (*Pongo pygmaeus*), which is primarily a frugivore (fruit-eater), and the black-and-white colobus monkey (*Colobus guereza*), which is a folivore (leaf-eater).\n\nTo isolate the effect of diet, the zoologist considers two hypothetical individuals, one of each species, with an identical total body mass, $M_{total} = 70.0 \\text{ kg}$.\n\nBased on extensive physiological data, it is known that for a typical colobus monkey, the mass of the entire digestive tract (stomach, small intestine, and large intestine) constitutes approximately $P_C = 27\\%$ of its total body mass. For a typical orangutan, this value is significantly lower, with the digestive tract accounting for $P_O = 13\\%$ of its total body mass.\n\nCalculate the absolute difference in the mass of the digestive tracts between the hypothetical colobus monkey and the orangutan. Express your answer in kilograms (kg), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the absolute difference in the mass of the digestive tracts between a colobus monkey and an orangutan, given their total body mass and the percentage of body mass their digestive tracts represent.\n\nLet $M_{total}$ be the total body mass of each animal, which is given as $70.0 \\text{ kg}$.\nLet $P_C$ be the percentage of total body mass that the digestive tract represents for the colobus monkey, given as $27\\%$.\nLet $P_O$ be the percentage of total body mass that the digestive tract represents for the orangutan, given as $13\\%$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the mass of the digestive tract for the colobus monkey, denoted as $M_{gut, C}$. To do this, we convert the percentage $P_C$ into a decimal by dividing by 100, and then multiply by the total body mass.\n$$M_{gut, C} = M_{total} \\times \\frac{P_C}{100}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{gut, C} = 70.0 \\text{ kg} \\times \\frac{27}{100} = 70.0 \\text{ kg} \\times 0.27 = 18.9 \\text{ kg}$$\n\nNext, we perform the same calculation for the orangutan to find the mass of its digestive tract, $M_{gut, O}$. We convert the percentage $P_O$ into a decimal.\n$$M_{gut, O} = M_{total} \\times \\frac{P_O}{100}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{gut, O} = 70.0 \\text{ kg} \\times \\frac{13}{100} = 70.0 \\text{ kg} \\times 0.13 = 9.1 \\text{ kg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the absolute difference in these masses, which we will denote as $\\Delta M_{gut}$.\n$$\\Delta M_{gut} = |M_{gut, C} - M_{gut, O}|$$\nSubstituting the calculated masses:\n$$\\Delta M_{gut} = |18.9 \\text{ kg} - 9.1 \\text{ kg}| = 9.8 \\text{ kg}$$\n\nAlternatively, one could first calculate the difference in percentages and then find the corresponding mass.\nThe difference in percentage, $\\Delta P$, is:\n$$\\Delta P = P_C - P_O = 27\\% - 13\\% = 14\\%$$\nNow, we find the mass that corresponds to this percentage of the total body mass:\n$$\\Delta M_{gut} = M_{total} \\times \\frac{\\Delta P}{100}$$\n$$\\Delta M_{gut} = 70.0 \\text{ kg} \\times \\frac{14}{100} = 70.0 \\text{ kg} \\times 0.14 = 9.8 \\text{ kg}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the final answer should be rounded to three significant figures.
