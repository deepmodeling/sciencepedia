This exercise uses a hypothetical scenario with a marine mussel to explore the immediate, physical consequences of a sudden shift in external salinity. By predicting the direction of water flow, you will apply the core concept of water potential to a real biological system, distinguishing between instantaneous osmotic effects and longer-term physiological adjustments. [@problem_id:1759157]", "problem": "A marine biologist is studying the physiological challenges faced by intertidal organisms. The study focuses on the blue mussel, *Mytilus edulis*, which is known to be a stenohaline osmoconformer. This means it conforms to the osmotic concentration of its environment but can only tolerate a narrow range of salinities. A specimen is collected from its natural habitat in the open ocean, where the seawater has a stable osmolarity of 1000 mOsm/L (milliosmoles per liter). The mussel is then abruptly transferred to a tank containing water from a brackish estuary, which has a much lower osmolarity of 400 mOsm/L.\n\nAssuming the mussel's cell membranes are permeable to water but not immediately to solutes, which of the following statements correctly describes the primary and immediate physiological consequence for the mussel's cells upon this transfer?\n\nA. There will be a net movement of water out of the mussel's cells and into the surrounding brackish water.\n\nB. There will be a net movement of water from the surrounding brackish water into the mussel's cells.\n\nC. The mussel will immediately begin actively transporting salts out of its cells to lower its internal osmolarity.\n\nD. There will be no net movement of water because, as an osmoconformer, the mussel's internal osmolarity is independent of the external environment.\n\nE. There will be no net movement of water or ions, as the mussel's shell provides a complete and impermeable barrier to the external environment.", "solution": "The mussel originates from seawater with osmolarity $C_{i}=1000$ mOsm/L and is abruptly placed into brackish water with osmolarity $C_{e}=400$ mOsm/L. Because the membranes are permeable to water but not immediately to solutes, the intracellular solute concentration remains at $C_{i}$ immediately after transfer, while the extracellular concentration is $C_{e}$. Thus, at the moment of transfer, $C_{i}>C_{e}$.\n\nOsmosis is driven by differences in the chemical potential of water across a semipermeable membrane. The chemical potential of water is\n$$\n\\mu_{w}=\\mu_{w}^{0}+RT\\ln a_{w},\n$$\nwhere $a_{w}$ is water activity, which decreases as solute concentration increases. Therefore, when $C_{i}>C_{e}$, we have $a_{w,i}<a_{w,e}$ and hence $\\mu_{w,i}<\\mu_{w,e}$. Water diffuses spontaneously from higher to lower water chemical potential, so water moves from the external medium into the cells.\n\nEquivalently, using the van't Hoff relation for osmotic pressure,\n$$\n\\Pi=RTC,\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the total osmolarity (already incorporating any van't Hoff factors). Immediately after transfer,\n$$\n\\Pi_{i}=RTC_{i}>RTC_{e}=\\Pi_{e}.\n$$\nWater flows into the compartment with higher osmotic pressure (higher solute concentration), i.e., from the brackish water into the mussel’s cells, causing them to swell.\n\nAs an osmoconformer, the mussel may eventually adjust its internal osmolarity to match the environment, but that is not immediate and does not prevent the initial osmotic influx. The shell does not provide a complete impermeable barrier to water movement across cell membranes within the organism.\n\nTherefore, the correct immediate consequence is a net movement of water into the mussel’s cells.\n\nMapping to the options, this corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1759157"}, {"introduction": "Moving from osmoconformers, we now turn our attention to osmoregulators, such as humans, who expend energy to maintain a stable internal milieu. This practice problem presents a classic survival scenario: can a dehydrated person drink seawater to rehydrate? By moving beyond qualitative reasoning to a quantitative analysis, you will use a simple solute balance to calculate why this seemingly logical action is physiologically disastrous, reinforcing the critical concept of an organism's osmoregulatory limits. [@problem_id:1759138]", "problem": "A fundamental challenge in animal physiology is maintaining a stable internal environment, a process known as homeostasis. Osmoregulation, the control of solute concentrations and water balance, is a critical aspect of this process. Humans are terrestrial osmoregulators, meaning their bodies actively manage their internal water and salt levels, which are significantly less concentrated than seawater.\n\nConsider a dehydrated individual who, in a survival scenario, drinks a volume $V_{drink}$ of seawater. To return the body's fluids to their normal concentration, the kidneys must excrete the ingested salt. However, the kidneys can only concentrate urine up to a certain maximum limit.\n\nFor this problem, use the following parameters:\n- The volume of seawater consumed is $V_{drink} = 0.750 \\text{ L}$.\n- The total solute concentration (osmolarity) of this particular seawater is $C_{sea} = 1400 \\text{ mOsm/L}$.\n- The maximum osmolarity the individual's kidneys can produce in urine is $C_{urine,max} = 1200 \\text{ mOsm/L}$.\n\nTo simplify the analysis, assume that the body must excrete all of the solutes ingested from the seawater to restore osmotic balance. For the purpose of this calculation, ignore other physiological factors such as metabolic water production, insensible water loss (e.g., from breathing), and sweating.\n\nCalculate the net change in the person's total body water, $\\Delta V_{body}$, after consuming the seawater and once the kidneys have fully processed the additional salt load.

The answer lies in sophisticated molecular machinery within specialized cells. This final practice delves into the cellular mechanism of salt secretion in the shark rectal gland, a classic model system for epithelial transport. By analyzing how a specific toxin disrupts this process, you will dissect the elegant interplay between primary active transport, which consumes ATP, and secondary active transport, which harnesses the resulting electrochemical gradients. [@problem_id:1759091]", "problem": "The dogfish shark, despite living in seawater, maintains an internal fluid environment that is hypoionic with respect to the surrounding ocean. To counteract the continuous influx of salt, it utilizes a specialized organ called the rectal gland to secrete a concentrated sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. The epithelial cells lining this gland employ a specific set of transport proteins to move NaCl from the blood to the gland's lumen.\n\nThe key proteins and their locations are as follows:\n1.  On the basolateral membrane (facing the blood): A Sodium-Potassium Adenosine Triphosphatase (Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase) pump and a Na$^+$-K$^+$-2Cl$^-$ (NKCC) cotransporter.\n2.  On the apical membrane (facing the lumen): A chloride ion channel.\n\nThe entire process of salt secretion is initiated by the activity of the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase.\n\nImagine an experiment where a living dogfish shark is administered a dose of ouabain, a highly specific toxin that immediately and completely inhibits the function of the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase pump in all its cells, including those of the rectal gland. Assuming all other cellular components are initially unaffected, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate consequence on the ion transport mechanism in the rectal gland's epithelial cells?\n\nA. Chloride ions will continue to be transported into the cell by the NKCC cotransporter, building up to a toxic intracellular concentration because their exit through the apical channel is blocked.\n\nB. The intracellular concentration of sodium ions will rapidly decrease, causing the cell to hyperpolarize and preventing any further ion transport.\n\nC. The electrochemical gradient for sodium entry into the cell will be dissipated, which in turn halts the secondary active transport of chloride ions into the cell via the NKCC cotransporter, thereby stopping salt secretion.\n\nD. To compensate for the loss of the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase, the cell will begin to actively transport sodium ions from the lumen into the cell through the apical membrane.\n\nE. The apical chloride channel will reverse its direction of transport, actively pumping chloride ions from the lumen back into the epithelial cell to restore the ion balance.", "solution": "In the normal rectal gland epithelial cell, the basolateral Na^{+}/K^{+}-ATPase uses ATP hydrolysis to export sodium and import potassium with the stoichiometry 3 Na^{+} out : 2 K^{+} in per ATP. This establishes and maintains low intracellular sodium and high intracellular potassium, and generates an electrogenic current that contributes to a negative membrane potential. The Na^{+} electrochemical potential difference for entry into the cell is\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Na}} = RT \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Na}]_{\\text{in}}}{[\\text{Na}]_{\\text{out}}}\\right) + z_{\\text{Na}} F \\Delta \\psi,\n$$\nwith $z_{\\text{Na}}=+1$ and $\\Delta \\psi = \\psi_{\\text{in}} - \\psi_{\\text{out}}$ typically negative, making $\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Na}}<0$ and strongly favorable for inward Na^{+} movement.\n\nThe basolateral NKCC cotransporter couples the movements of 1 Na^{+}, 1 K^{+}, and 2 Cl^{-} into the cell. Its net thermodynamic driving force for inward cotransport is the sum of the constituent electrochemical potential differences:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{NKCC}} = \\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Na}} + \\Delta \\mu_{\\text{K}} + 2\\,\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Cl}}.\n$$\nInward cotransport requires $\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{NKCC}}<0$. The large negative $\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Na}}$ generated by the Na^{+}/K^{+}-ATPase is the primary energy source that renders $\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{NKCC}}$ negative, permitting secondary active accumulation of Cl^{-} in the cytosol. On the apical side, a Cl^{-} channel provides passive Cl^{-} efflux down its electrochemical gradient; channels do not use ATP and do not actively pump, so their flux direction follows the sign of\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Cl}} = RT \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{in}}}{[\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{out}}}\\right) - F \\Delta \\psi.\n$$\n\nUpon administration of ouabain, the Na^{+}/K^{+}-ATPase is immediately and completely inhibited, so the pump flux is set to zero. Without active Na^{+} extrusion, the intracellular sodium begins to rise due to ongoing passive leaks and cotransporter-mediated movements, making\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{Na}]_{\\text{in}}}{dt} > 0,\n$$\nand the electrogenic contribution of the pump to a negative membrane potential ceases, favoring depolarization rather than hyperpolarization. As $[\\text{Na}]_{\\text{in}}$ rises and $\\Delta \\psi$ becomes less negative, $\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Na}}$ becomes less negative in magnitude (approaches zero). Consequently, the sum\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{NKCC}} = \\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Na}} + \\Delta \\mu_{\\text{K}} + 2\\,\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Cl}}\n$$\nincreases toward zero and cannot remain negative to drive inward NKCC flux. Thermodynamically, when $\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{NKCC}} \\ge 0$, net inward secondary active transport of Cl^{-} (and its coupled Na^{+} and K^{+}) halts. Therefore, the NKCC-mediated entry of Cl^{-} into the cell stops, and without continued Cl^{-} loading, apical Cl^{-} secretion quickly diminishes as the cytosolic Cl^{-} driving force dissipates. The apical Cl^{-} channel does not reverse to actively pump; it remains a passive conduit whose flux depends on the existing gradient.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is false because NKCC requires the Na^{+} gradient; once the pump is inhibited, Cl^{-} loading via NKCC ceases, and the apical channel is not blocked.\n- B is false because intracellular Na^{+} will rise, not decrease, and the membrane tends to depolarize, not hyperpolarize.\n- C is correct: dissipation of the Na^{+} electrochemical gradient halts secondary active NKCC-mediated Cl^{-} entry, stopping salt secretion.\n- D is false: there is no apical active Na^{+} pump to compensate.\n- E is false: channels do not actively pump and do not reverse independent of the gradient.\n\nThus, the immediate consequence is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1759091"}]}
