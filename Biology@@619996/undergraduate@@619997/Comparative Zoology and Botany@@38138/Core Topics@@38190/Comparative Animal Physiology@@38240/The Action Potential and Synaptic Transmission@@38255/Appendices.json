By considering the relationship between the resting membrane potential and the ion's equilibrium potential, you will predict the direction of change and solidify your understanding of hyperpolarization and the basis of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs).", "problem": "A neuron is observed to have a steady resting membrane potential of $V_{m} = -70 \\text{ mV}$. This neuron forms a synapse with another neuron that releases a specific neurotransmitter. When this neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, it exclusively opens ligand-gated ion channels that are permeable to a single species of ion. Through independent measurement, the equilibrium potential for this specific ion has been determined to be $E_{ion} = -90 \\text{ mV}$.\n\nWhat will be the immediate effect on the postsynaptic neuron's membrane potential at the site of the synapse when these channels open?\n\nA. The membrane will depolarize, becoming less negative.\n\nB. The membrane will hyperpolarize, becoming more negative.\n\nC. The membrane potential will not change.\n\nD. The neuron will immediately fire an action potential.\n\nE. The membrane will repolarize.", "solution": "Principle: When ligand-gated channels selective for a single ion open, the membrane potential $V_{m}$ is driven toward that ionâ€™s equilibrium potential $E_{\\text{ion}}$ by the ionic current. For a channel with conductance $g_{\\text{ion}}$, the ionic current is\n$$\nI_{\\text{ion}} = g_{\\text{ion}}\\left(V_{m} - E_{\\text{ion}}\\right),\n$$\nand the membrane equation gives\n$$\nC_{m}\\frac{dV_{m}}{dt} = - I_{\\text{ion}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{dV_{m}}{dt} = - \\frac{g_{\\text{ion}}}{C_{m}}\\left(V_{m} - E_{\\text{ion}}\\right).\n$$\nUpon channel opening, $g_{\\text{ion}} > 0$. Given that $E_{\\text{ion}}$ is more negative than the resting $V_{m}$ (specifically, $E_{\\text{ion}} = -90 \\text{ mV}$ and $V_{m} = -70 \\text{ mV}$, so $E_{\\text{ion}} < V_{m}$), it follows that\n$$\nV_{m} - E_{\\text{ion}} > 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{dV_{m}}{dt} < 0.\n$$\nTherefore, immediately after the channels open, $V_{m}$ becomes more negative at the synapse and is driven toward $E_{\\text{ion}}$. This is a hyperpolarization (an inhibitory postsynaptic potential).\nHence, the correct choice is that the membrane will hyperpolarize, becoming more negative.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1778465"}, {"introduction": "A single neuron in the brain can receive thousands of inputs, both excitatory and inhibitory. This practice challenges you to model how a neuron processes these competing signals through a process called synaptic integration [@problem_id:1778427]. By calculating the net effect of a simultaneous excitatory and inhibitory potential, you will determine whether the neuron reaches its firing threshold, illustrating the fundamental computation that underlies neural decision-making.", "problem": "A spinal motoneuron in a simple reflex arc has a stable resting membrane potential of $-70$ mV. For an action potential to be initiated at its axon hillock, the membrane potential must reach a threshold value of $-55$ mV. This neuron simultaneously receives inputs from two presynaptic neurons. The first input is from an excitatory synapse, which generates an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP). If this were the only input, it would cause a peak depolarization of $+17$ mV at the axon hillock. The second input is from an inhibitory synapse, which generates an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP). If this were the only input, it would cause a peak hyperpolarization of $-5$ mV at the axon hillock.\n\nAssuming the effects of these two potentials are spatially and temporally summed in a perfectly linear fashion at the axon hillock, calculate the resulting peak membrane potential.

This thought experiment explores the cellular machinery behind this process by examining a hypothetical scenario where vesicle recycling is impaired [@problem_id:1778420]. Analyzing the consequences of sustained stimulation without vesicle replenishment will illuminate the concept of synaptic depression and the importance of the vesicle cycle in maintaining synaptic function.", "problem": "In the central nervous system of a particular species of snail, a specific population of neurons utilizes acetylcholine as their primary neurotransmitter. A researcher discovers a strain of these snails with a genetic mutation that results in a non-functional version of the protein clathrin. Clathrin is essential for mediating the endocytosis required to form new synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic membrane after neurotransmitter release.\n\nConsider a presynaptic neuron from this mutant snail forming a synapse with a postsynaptic neuron. The presynaptic neuron is subjected to a continuous, high-frequency train of action potentials. All other cellular processes, including action potential propagation, ion channel function (excluding processes directly dependent on vesicle recycling), and neurotransmitter synthesis within the cytoplasm, are assumed to be normal.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected response observed in the postsynaptic neuron during this period of sustained, high-frequency stimulation?\n\nA. No postsynaptic potential will be generated, even in response to the very first presynaptic action potential.\n\nB. An initial series of postsynaptic potentials will be generated, but their magnitude will rapidly decrease, eventually falling to zero despite the ongoing presynaptic stimulation.\n\nC. The magnitude of the postsynaptic potentials will grow progressively larger with each successive presynaptic action potential, a phenomenon known as facilitation.\n\nD. The neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, will accumulate in the synaptic cleft, leading to a single, prolonged, and non-diminishing postsynaptic potential.\n\nE. The presynaptic neuron will fail to fire action potentials after the first few stimuli due to a buildup of membrane at the axon terminal.", "solution": "Clathrin mediates endocytosis that regenerates synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic membrane after exocytosis. In the mutant, clathrin is non-functional, so the rate of vesicle regeneration is effectively zero. Let $N(t)$ denote the number of fusion-competent synaptic vesicles available for release at time $t$, with initial pool $N(0)=N_{0}>0$ coming from the pre-existing readily releasable and reserve pools.\n\nUnder a high-frequency train of action potentials at frequency $f$, each action potential releases, on average, a quantal content $m(t)$ that depends on release probability $p(t)$ and the number of available release sites populated by vesicles $n_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$, so $m(t)=p(t)\\,n_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$ with $n_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)\\leq N(t)$. Because there is no clathrin-mediated endocytosis, vesicle recycling is absent, so vesicle availability evolves according to\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=-f\\,m(t), \\quad N(0)=N_{0}, \\quad \\text{with no positive replenishment term.}\n$$\nThis implies $N(t)$ is monotonically decreasing and bounded below by $0$. Since $m(t)\\leq N(t)$ and $p(t)>0$ while $N(t)>0$, continued stimulation causes $N(t)\\to 0$ in finite time, after which $m(t)=0$.\n\nThe postsynaptic potential amplitude $A(t)$ is proportional to the quantal content times the postsynaptic response per quantum $q$, so\n$$\nA(t)=q\\,m(t).\n$$\nInitially, $N(0)>0$ so $m(0)>0$ and postsynaptic potentials are generated. During sustained high-frequency stimulation, $N(t)$ depletes because there is no vesicle recycling, so $m(t)$ and hence $A(t)$ decrease and ultimately reach $0$ despite ongoing presynaptic action potentials.\n\nBrief facilitation due to residual $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ could transiently increase $p(t)$ over the first few spikes, but without vesicle recycling the dominant effect is rapid synaptic depression as $n_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$ and $N(t)$ are depleted, causing $A(t)\\to 0$. Accumulation of acetylcholine in the cleft does not occur because release ceases as vesicles deplete and acetylcholine is continuously cleared by acetylcholinesterase and diffusion; a simple clearance model,\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt}=R_{\\mathrm{release}}(t)-\\lambda C(t),\n$$\nwith $\\lambda>0$ and $R_{\\mathrm{release}}(t)\\to 0$, yields $C(t)\\to 0$ rather than a sustained plateau. Presynaptic action potential propagation remains intact by assumption, so the failure is not at the level of axonal excitability.\n\nTherefore, the postsynaptic neuron will show initial postsynaptic potentials that rapidly diminish to zero during sustained stimulation.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A is false because $N_{0}>0$ permits initial release.\n- B is correct: initial postsynaptic potentials occur but rapidly decrease to zero as vesicles are depleted.\n- C is false: any early facilitation is transient and overridden by depletion.\n- D is false: acetylcholine does not accumulate; it is cleared while release ceases.\n- E is false: action potential propagation is normal and not limited by membrane accumulation.\n\nThus the most accurate choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1778420"}]}
