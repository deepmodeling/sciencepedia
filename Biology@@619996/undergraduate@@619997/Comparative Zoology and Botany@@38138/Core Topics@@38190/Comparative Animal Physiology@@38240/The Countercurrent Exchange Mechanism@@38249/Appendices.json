Nature has evolved elegant solutions to maximize this efficiency, and the countercurrent mechanism is one of its most widespread and effective strategies. This introductory practice challenges you to think like an evolutionary biologist by comparing different possible circulatory arrangements in a hypothetical organism to deduce which one provides the most effective oxygen uptake, thereby revealing the core principle that makes countercurrent exchange superior. [@problem_id:1780159]", "problem": "A hypothetical, vermiform (worm-like) animal has been discovered living in the sediments of a deep, cold lake. The sediment is hypoxic, meaning the partial pressure of oxygen in the surrounding water is very low. This organism breathes through its skin, which is perfused by a dense network of capillaries. A gentle, continuous current of water flows over the animal's body surface from its anterior (head) to its posterior (tail) end. The deoxygenated blood from the body enters the skin's capillary network with a very low initial partial pressure of oxygen, $P_{\\text{O}_2, \\text{blood, in}}$, and leaves as oxygenated blood with a final pressure, $P_{\\text{O}_2, \\text{blood, out}}$. The water flowing over the skin has an initial oxygen partial pressure of $P_{\\text{O}_2, \\text{water, in}}$ at the anterior end.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist proposes four possible models for the arrangement and function of the capillary network in the skin to facilitate gas exchange. Assume all other factors, such as skin thickness, total capillary surface area, and the flow rates of both blood and water, are identical for each model.\n\nWhich of the following proposed models would allow the animal to achieve the highest possible partial pressure of oxygen in the blood leaving the respiratory capillaries ($P_{\\text{O}_2, \\text{blood, out}}$)?\n\nA. **Cocurrent Model**: The blood in the skin capillaries flows from the animal's anterior to its posterior end, in the same direction as the external water flow.\nB. **Countercurrent Model**: The blood in the skin capillaries flows from the animal's posterior to its anterior end, in the opposite direction to the external water flow.\nC. **Avascular Model**: The animal has no circulatory system. Oxygen from the water diffuses directly through the skin and other tissues to the cells where it is consumed. The question is interpreted as asking which model provides the highest $P_{\\text{O}_2}$ to the deepest tissues.\nD. **Pool Model**: The capillaries form a large, shallow sinus beneath the skin. Blood enters this sinus, pools, and mixes completely before being collected into an outgoing vessel. The pooled blood equilibrates with the average oxygen partial pressure of the water flowing over the entire surface.", "solution": "Let the water flow from the anterior to the posterior be along a coordinate $x \\in [0,L]$, with $x=0$ at the anterior. Let $P_{w}(x)$ and $P_{b}(x)$ denote the local partial pressures of oxygen in water and blood at the respiratory surface, respectively. Oxygen transfer across the skin is driven by the local difference $P_{w}(x) - P_{b}(x)$. For a thin membrane with overall mass transfer coefficient per unit length-times-area $M$ (a constant that subsumes the product of mass transfer coefficient and surface area per unit length), the local molar flux per unit length is\n$$\nJ(x) \\;=\\; M\\,[P_{w}(x) - P_{b}(x)].\n$$\nConvection carries oxygen along each stream according to its capacity (solubility-times-flow) to store oxygen per unit partial pressure. Define the capacity flow rates\n$$\nG_{w} \\equiv Q_{w} H_{w}, \\qquad G_{b} \\equiv Q_{b} H_{b},\n$$\nwhere $Q_{w}$ and $Q_{b}$ are volumetric flow rates and $H_{w}$ and $H_{b}$ are the oxygen capacitance coefficients (oxygen content per unit volume per unit partial pressure) in water and blood, respectively. These definitions imply that a small change in oxygen partial pressure corresponds to a convective oxygen content change $G\\,dP$ in each stream.\n\nCocurrent model (A): Both streams flow in the $+x$ direction, entering at $x=0$ with $P_{w}(0)=P_{\\text{O}_2,\\text{water,in}}$ and $P_{b}(0)=P_{\\text{O}_2,\\text{blood,in}}$. A differential material balance on oxygen over a slice $dx$ gives\n$$\nG_{w}\\,\\frac{dP_{w}}{dx} \\;=\\; -M\\,[P_{w} - P_{b}], \\qquad\nG_{b}\\,\\frac{dP_{b}}{dx} \\;=\\; +M\\,[P_{w} - P_{b}].\n$$\nDefine the driving-force difference $\\Delta(x) \\equiv P_{w}(x) - P_{b}(x)$.

A standard and exact way to compare outlet performance for fixed $G_{w},G_{b}$ and total transfer conductance $U A$ (the integral of $M$ over length) is to use the two-stream exchanger effectiveness.

By Fick’s law with consumption, the deepest tissues necessarily have $P_{\\text{O}_2}$ below the boundary value at the skin; there is no blood outlet to consider, and even under the interpretation given, diffusion alone yields lower $P_{\\text{O}_2}$ at depth than a perfused respiratory surface can deliver convectively.\n\nTherefore, for fixed $U A$, $G_{w}$, and $G_{b}$, the countercurrent model maintains the largest mean driving force and achieves the highest possible partial pressure of oxygen in the blood leaving the respiratory capillaries.
