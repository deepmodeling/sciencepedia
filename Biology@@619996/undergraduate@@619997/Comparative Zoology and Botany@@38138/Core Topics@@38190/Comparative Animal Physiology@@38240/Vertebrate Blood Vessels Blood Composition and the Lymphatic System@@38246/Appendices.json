This maneuver subjects the bird to extreme decelerative forces. To survive, the gannet's cardiovascular system must execute rapid adjustments to maintain stable blood flow to the brain, preventing both ischemia (underperfusion) and hemorrhage (overperfusion).\n\nConsider a simplified physiological model of a gannet at the moment of impact with the water. The bird is oriented vertically, and the impact induces a nearly instantaneous, uniform vertical deceleration of magnitude $a$. The primary challenge is to counteract the inertial effects on the column of blood between the heart and the brain. We assume that to maintain consciousness, the cerebral blood flow rate, $Q_{brain}$, must be held constant. This is achieved by an immediate reflexive change in the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) at the aortic arch, generated by a change in the total systemic vascular resistance.\n\nAssume the following:\n- The perfusion pressure driving blood to the brain is the difference between the MAP at the aortic arch and the hydrostatic/inertial pressure at the level of the brain.\n- The vascular resistance of the cerebral circulation, $R_{brain}$, remains constant during the instantaneous impact event.\n- The compression of the thorax during impact causes the cardiac output (CO) to instantaneously increase by a factor $k$.\n- The relationship between MAP, cardiac output (CO), and total systemic vascular resistance ($R_{sys}$) is given by $MAP = CO \\times R_{sys}$.\n\nGiven the following parameters for a diving gannet:\n- Magnitude of deceleration at impact, $a = 365 \\text{ m/s}^2$.\n- Vertical distance from the aortic arch to the brain, $h = 0.200 \\text{ m}$.\n- Density of blood, $\\rho_{blood} = 1060 \\text{ kg/m}^3$.\n- Baseline MAP before impact, $P_{base} = 2.00 \\times 10^4 \\text{ Pa}$.\n- Baseline total systemic vascular resistance before impact, $R_{sys\\_base} = 4.00 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa} \\cdot \\text{s/m}^3$.\n- Cardiac output multiplication factor upon impact, $k = 1.50$.\n- Acceleration due to gravity, $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$.\n\nCalculate the required new total systemic vascular resistance, $R_{sys\\_new}$, that the gannet's body must achieve instantaneously upon impact to keep cerebral blood flow constant.
