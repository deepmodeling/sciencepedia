{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Phototropism, a plant's growth towards light, is a fundamental survival mechanism. This hands-on practice revisits the logic of classic experiments that first uncovered how plants achieve this feat. By analyzing a series of hypothetical manipulations on a seedling, you will deconstruct the phototropic signaling pathway into its core components: perception of the light stimulus, transmission of a chemical signal, and the resulting differential growth response [@problem_id:1765626]. This exercise sharpens your ability to think like an experimental scientist, isolating variables to understand a complex biological process.", "problem": "A botanist is investigating the mechanism of phototropism in a newly discovered plant species, *Avena ficticia*. The seedlings of this plant consist of a single, upright shoot known as a coleoptile. Preliminary studies have established two key facts: 1) A growth-promoting hormone, which we will call \"auxilin,\" is synthesized exclusively in the apical tip of the coleoptile and is required for cell elongation in the region below the tip. 2) The perception of light direction occurs only at the apical tip.\n\nTo further explore this phenomenon, the botanist sets up an experiment with five groups of genetically identical seedlings. All groups are placed in a dark environment and are illuminated by a single, unidirectional light source from the right side for 24 hours. The five groups are treated as follows:\n\n- **Group 1 (Control):** The seedlings are left entirely unmodified.\n- **Group 2 (Decapitated):** The apical tip of each seedling is surgically removed.\n- **Group 3 (Capped Tip):** The apical tip is covered with a small, opaque cap that prevents any light from reaching the tip, but does not cover the lower region of the coleoptile.\n- **Group 4 (Permeable Insert):** The apical tip is surgically separated from the lower part of the coleoptile, and a thin, sterile layer of permeable agar gel is inserted into the gap, re-establishing contact.\n- **Group 5 (Transport Inhibitor):** The entire seedling is sprayed with a chemical solution called \"Transhibin.\" This substance is known to completely and specifically block the downward transport of auxilin from the tip to the lower regions, without affecting auxilin production or the ability of cells to respond to it.\n\nBased on the established principles of plant phototropism, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the observable outcomes for the five groups?\n\nA. Group 1 bends towards the light. Group 3 grows straight up. Groups 2, 4, and 5 show no significant growth or bending.\nB. Groups 1 and 4 bend towards the light. Group 3 grows straight up. Groups 2 and 5 show no significant growth or bending.\nC. Groups 1, 3, and 4 bend towards the light. Group 2 shows no significant growth or bending. Group 5 grows straight up.\nD. Group 1 bends towards the light. Groups 3 and 4 grow straight up. Groups 2 and 5 show no significant growth or bending.\nE. Groups 1 and 4 bend towards the light. Group 2 shows no significant growth or bending. Groups 3 and 5 grow straight up.", "solution": "The solution to this problem lies in applying the Cholodny-Went hypothesis, which is the standard model for phototropism in coleoptiles. The hypothesis states that a unidirectional light stimulus on the tip of a coleoptile causes a growth-promoting hormone (in this case, \"auxilin\") to migrate from the illuminated side to the shaded side within the tip. This hormone is then transported down the coleoptile. The higher concentration of auxilin on the shaded side stimulates greater cell elongation compared to the illuminated side. This differential rate of growth causes the coleoptile to bend towards the light source.\n\nLet's analyze each experimental group based on this model:\n\n**Group 1 (Control):** This group has an intact system. The tip perceives the light, auxilin migrates to the shaded (left) side, it's transported downwards, and causes greater elongation on the left side. Therefore, Group 1 will bend towards the right, where the light source is.\n\n**Group 2 (Decapitated):** The apical tip is the exclusive site of auxilin production. By removing the tip, the source of the growth hormone is eliminated. Without auxilin, the cells in the lower region of the coleoptile cannot elongate. Consequently, the seedlings in Group 2 will show no significant growth and, therefore, no bending.\n\n**Group 3 (Capped Tip):** The opaque cap prevents the tip from perceiving the unidirectional light. The tip will continue to produce auxilin, but because there is no light stimulus to cause its lateral redistribution, the auxilin will be transported downwards symmetrically. Both sides of the coleoptile will receive equal amounts of the hormone and will elongate at the same rate. This results in vertical growth without any bending. The seedling will grow straight up.\n\n**Group 4 (Permeable Insert):** The agar gel is permeable to water-soluble molecules like the auxilin hormone. The tip perceives the light stimulus and redistributes auxilin to the shaded side. This asymmetrically distributed auxilin then diffuses across the agar gel into the lower part of the coleoptile. The concentration gradient is maintained, with more auxilin on the shaded side. This leads to differential growth, and the coleoptile will bend towards the light. This classic experimental setup demonstrates that the signal for phototropism is a mobile chemical substance.\n\n**Group 5 (Transport Inhibitor):** The \"Transhibin\" chemical blocks the downward transport of auxilin. Although the tip perceives the light and produces auxilin (and may even redistribute it laterally within the tip), the hormone cannot travel from the tip to the zone of cell elongation below. Since the growth signal cannot reach the cells that are supposed to respond, no elongation will occur. The effect is functionally equivalent to decapitation or inserting an impermeable barrier. Therefore, the seedlings in Group 5 will show no significant growth or bending.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Group 1: Bends towards light.\n- Group 2: No significant growth or bending.\n- Group 3: Grows straight up.\n- Group 4: Bends towards light.\n- Group 5: No significant growth or bending.\n\nComparing these conclusions with the given options:\n- A is incorrect because it claims Group 4 will not grow or bend.\n- B correctly states that Groups 1 and 4 will bend, Group 3 will grow straight up, and Groups 2 and 5 will show no significant growth or bending.\n- C is incorrect as it claims Group 3 bends and Group 5 grows straight up.\n- D is incorrect because it claims Group 4 grows straight up.\n- E is incorrect as it claims Group 5 grows straight up.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that accurately describes the expected outcomes for all five groups is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1765626"}, {"introduction": "Just as shoots grow towards light, roots typically grow in the direction of gravityâ€”a response called positive gravitropism. While this process also relies on the hormone auxin, its action in roots differs critically from its role in shoots. This practice invites you to explore the gravitropic mechanism by considering a scenario where a key step, the transport of auxin to the growth region, is blocked [@problem_id:1765604]. Successfully predicting the outcome requires a precise understanding of how the perception of gravity in the root cap is translated into a directed growth response in the zone of elongation.", "problem": "In plant roots, the perception of gravity and the subsequent growth response, known as positive gravitropism, is a well-coordinated physiological process. This process ensures that roots grow downwards, anchoring the plant and accessing water and nutrients. The currently accepted model for this phenomenon involves the hormone auxin. In a horizontally oriented root, gravity is perceived in the root cap, leading to a higher concentration of auxin accumulating along the lower side of the root. This auxin is then transported to the region of active growth, the zone of elongation. In root cells, unlike in shoot cells, high concentrations of auxin inhibit cell elongation.\n\nConsider a healthy seedling of a typical dicot plant that is placed horizontally in otherwise optimal growth conditions. An experiment is conducted where a potent, localized inhibitor of polar auxin transport is carefully applied directly and exclusively to the root's zone of elongation. The root cap and the meristematic zone remain unaffected by this inhibitor. All other physiological processes are assumed to remain normal.\n\nBased on your understanding of the mechanism of root gravitropism, which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed after the application of the inhibitor?\n\nA. The root will exhibit an exaggerated downward curvature compared to an untreated root.\nB. The root will exhibit a normal downward curvature, as gravity perception in the root cap is unaffected.\nC. The root will fail to curve downwards and will instead continue to grow horizontally.\nD. The root will curve upwards, exhibiting negative gravitropism.\nE. The root will cease all growth in length immediately.", "solution": "1) In a horizontally oriented root, gravity is perceived by statolith-containing columella cells in the root cap. This perception triggers a lateral redistribution of auxin so that auxin accumulates on the lower side of the root cap.\n\n2) For the gravitropic response to occur, the auxin asymmetry must be conveyed from the root cap to the zone of elongation via polar auxin transport. This delivery establishes an auxin gradient across the upper and lower sides of the zone of elongation.\n\n3) In roots, elevated auxin concentration inhibits cell elongation. Therefore, when the auxin gradient reaches the zone of elongation, cells on the lower side elongate less, and cells on the upper side elongate more, producing downward curvature (positive gravitropism).\n\n4) In the experiment, a potent inhibitor of polar auxin transport is applied directly and exclusively to the zone of elongation, while the root cap and meristematic zone remain unaffected. Thus, gravity perception and initial auxin asymmetry in the root cap proceed normally.\n\n5) However, the gravitropic bending requires that the auxin asymmetry be transmitted to and maintained within the zone of elongation. Blocking polar auxin transport in the zone of elongation prevents the asymmetric auxin signal from entering and/or being differentially distributed across this region.\n\n6) As a result, the zone of elongation does not experience the requisite lateral auxin gradient; elongation remains symmetric across upper and lower sides. Growth machinery per se is not globally inhibited, so elongation can continue, but without curvature.\n\n7) Therefore, the root will fail to curve downwards and will instead continue to grow along its original (horizontal) direction.\n\nGiven the options, this corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1765604"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the directional movements of tropisms, plants exhibit nastic movements, such as the daily folding and unfolding of leaves, which are independent of the stimulus's direction. This exercise examines the control mechanism behind these \"sleep movements,\" or nyctinasty, by analyzing a plant's behavior under constant environmental conditions [@problem_id:1765631]. Your task is to interpret the evidence to determine whether the movement is a simple reaction to external cues or is governed by an endogenous, self-sustaining biological clock, a concept central to the field of chronobiology.", "problem": "A plant physiologist is studying nyctinasty, the rhythmic \"sleep movements\" of leaves, in a bean plant (*Phaseolus vulgaris*). Under a standard 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle, the plant's leaves are held horizontally during the light period and fold downwards during the dark period. To investigate the underlying control mechanism, the physiologist moves a healthy, well-watered specimen into a growth chamber that is maintained in complete, uninterrupted darkness and at a constant temperature and humidity for 96 hours. The observation is that the leaves continue to perform their up-and-down movements rhythmically, with a consistent cycle length of approximately 23.5 hours.\n\nBased on this experimental observation, which of the following statements provides the most accurate scientific conclusion about the control mechanism of nyctinasty?\n\nA. The movement is a direct response to a subtle environmental cue that was not controlled, such as minute fluctuations in Earth's magnetic field or atmospheric pressure, which follow a 24-hour cycle.\nB. The plant possesses a form of cellular \"memory,\" allowing it to repeat the behavior it was entrained to in the previous light-dark cycle for a few days.\nC. The rhythmic movement is controlled by an endogenous, self-sustaining biological oscillator (a circadian rhythm), which does not require external environmental cycles to function.\nD. The movement is a passive process driven by the gradual depletion and subsequent slow regeneration of a specific chemical required for maintaining turgor pressure, a process that coincidentally takes about a day.\nE. The plant must have stored enough light energy in its photoreceptors to power the movements for several days, with a gradual release of this energy triggering the motion.", "solution": "Define the observed period in constant conditions as the free-running period, denoted $\\tau$. In the experiment, the plant is kept in continuous darkness with constant temperature and humidity for $96$ hours, and the leaf movements persist rhythmically with $\\tau \\approx 23.5$ hours. The environmental cycle period (when present) is $T=24$ hours.\n\nLogical steps:\n\n1. Criterion for an endogenous circadian rhythm: By definition, a circadian oscillator is an endogenous, self-sustaining biological clock that (i) persists in constant conditions without external cues, (ii) has a free-running period $\\tau$ close to, but not necessarily equal to, $24$ hours, (iii) is entrainable to external zeitgebers such as light-dark cycles, and (iv) is approximately temperature compensated. The observation that rhythmic movement continues in the absence of external cycles directly satisfies criterion (i), and the measured $\\tau \\approx 23.5$ hours satisfies criterion (ii).\n\n2. Evaluate Option A (uncontrolled environmental cue): If an external cue with a $24$-hour cycle were driving the rhythm, the observed period would match $T=24$ hours. The measured $\\tau \\approx 23.5$ hours deviates from $24$ hours, which argues against a direct exogenous driver. Moreover, the chamber conditions are controlled to eliminate conventional zeitgebers, and putative subtle cues would still not explain the specific free-running period differing from $24$ hours. Therefore, A is inconsistent with the non-$24$-hour period.\n\n3. Evaluate Option B (cellular memory of prior entrainment): A transient memory of past light-dark cycles would not generate a stable, self-sustaining oscillation with a consistent non-$24$-hour period over multiple days; instead, one would expect damping or drift toward arrhythmicity, or, if memory merely reproduces past timing, a $24$-hour period rather than $\\tau \\approx 23.5$ hours. The persistence and stability of a near-$24$-hour but distinct period in constant conditions is a hallmark of an endogenous oscillator rather than short-term memory. Therefore, B is not supported.\n\n4. Evaluate Option C (endogenous circadian oscillator): The continuation of rhythmic nyctinastic movements in constant darkness and constant environment, with a stable $\\tau \\approx 23.5$ hours, directly supports the existence of an endogenous circadian oscillator that can free-run without external cues. This matches canonical circadian behavior (free-running period near $24$ hours and entrainability to light-dark cycles). Therefore, C is supported.\n\n5. Evaluate Option D (passive chemical depletion-regeneration with coincidental day-length timescale): A passive process tied to depletion and slow regeneration lacks the properties of a self-sustained oscillator; such processes typically show damping and are strongly sensitive to metabolic rate and temperature, rather than producing a robust, sustained, and precise rhythm with a characteristic $\\tau$ in constant conditions. The observed stability and persistence argue against a simple passive mechanism. Therefore, D is not supported.\n\n6. Evaluate Option E (stored light energy in photoreceptors powering motion): Nyctinastic movements are driven by changes in turgor in pulvinar motor cells regulated by ion fluxes and metabolic activity; they do not depend on stored photon energy in photoreceptors to trigger multi-day oscillations. Additionally, the maintenance of rhythmicity with $\\tau \\approx 23.5$ hours over several days in the dark is not plausibly explained by gradual release of stored photonic energy. Therefore, E is not supported.\n\nConclusion: The observation of a free-running rhythm in constant conditions with $\\tau \\approx 23.5$ hours most accurately supports an endogenous circadian oscillator controlling nyctinasty.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1765631"}]}
