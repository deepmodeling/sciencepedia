This exercise focuses on a core quantitative aspect: the ratio of maternal to paternal genomes in the two key products, the zygote and the endosperm. By calculating these ratios, we can precisely define the distinct genetic architecture that sets angiosperms apart from other plant groups. [@problem_id:1744374]", "problem": "In a typical angiosperm, the sexual reproduction process, known as double fertilization, involves two distinct fusion events within the ovule. The male gametophyte (pollen grain) delivers two haploid sperm nuclei. The female gametophyte (embryo sac) contains, among other cells, a haploid egg cell and a central cell which itself contains two haploid polar nuclei.\n\nThe first fertilization event is the fusion of one sperm nucleus with the egg cell, forming the diploid zygote which develops into the embryo. The second event is the fusion of the other sperm nucleus with the central cell (containing the two polar nuclei), forming the triploid endosperm, a nutritive tissue for the developing embryo.\n\nLet $R_{zygote}$ be defined as the ratio of the number of maternal genomes to the number of paternal genomes in the resulting diploid zygote. Similarly, let $R_{endosperm}$ be defined as the ratio of the number of maternal genomes to the number of paternal genomes in the resulting triploid endosperm.\n\nCalculate the numerical value of the expression $\\frac{R_{endosperm}}{R_{zygote}}$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to compute the ratio of two other ratios, which are related to the genomic contributions in the zygote and the endosperm of an angiosperm. Let's break down the problem into steps.\n\nFirst, we determine the genomic composition of the diploid zygote. The zygote forms from the fusion of one haploid sperm nucleus and one haploid egg cell. The sperm nucleus originates from the pollen grain, which is part of the male parent, so its genomic contribution is paternal. The egg cell is part of the embryo sac, which is part of the female parent, so its genomic contribution is maternal.\n- Number of maternal genomes in the zygote = 1 (from the egg cell).\n- Number of paternal genomes in the zygote = 1 (from the sperm nucleus).\n\nThe ratio of maternal to paternal genomes in the zygote, $R_{zygote}$, is therefore:\n$$R_{zygote} = \\frac{\\text{Number of maternal genomes}}{\\text{Number of paternal genomes}} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$$\n\nSecond, we determine the genomic composition of the triploid endosperm. The endosperm forms from the fusion of the second haploid sperm nucleus with the central cell of the embryo sac. The problem states that the central cell contains two haploid polar nuclei. Both polar nuclei are derived from the female parent.\n- The paternal contribution to the endosperm comes from the single sperm nucleus.\n- The maternal contribution to the endosperm comes from the two polar nuclei within the central cell.\n\nSo, for the endosperm:\n- Number of maternal genomes in the endosperm = 2 (from the two polar nuclei).\n- Number of paternal genomes in the endosperm = 1 (from the second sperm nucleus).\n\nThe ratio of maternal to paternal genomes in the endosperm, $R_{endosperm}$, is therefore:\n$$R_{endosperm} = \\frac{\\text{Number of maternal genomes}}{\\text{Number of paternal genomes}} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$$\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the value of the expression $\\frac{R_{endosperm}}{R_{zygote}}$. Using the values we just calculated:\n$$\\frac{R_{endosperm}}{R_{zygote}} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$$\n\nThus, the final numerical value is 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1744374"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple chromosome counts, the real power of understanding double fertilization lies in its genetic implications. This practice bridges the gap between cellular mechanisms and Mendelian genetics, asking you to predict the possible genotypes of the endosperm from a self-pollinating heterozygous plant. This skill is fundamental for plant breeders and geneticists studying how traits are inherited and expressed in seeds. [@problem_id:1744320]", "problem": "In flowering plants (angiosperms), double fertilization is a complex process where two male gametes (sperm nuclei) from a single pollen grain fertilize two different female cells within the ovule. One sperm nucleus fuses with the egg cell to form the diploid ($2n$) zygote, which develops into the embryo. The other sperm nucleus fuses with the large central cell of the ovule, which contains two haploid polar nuclei. This fusion results in the formation of a triploid ($3n$) primary endosperm nucleus, which develops into the endosperm, a nutritive tissue for the embryo.\n\nConsider a hypothetical plant that is heterozygous for a gene controlling seed coat texture, with alleles for smooth ($A$) and wrinkled ($a$) textures. The plant's genotype is $Aa$. This plant undergoes self-pollination, meaning its ovules are fertilized by its own pollen. Assuming standard Mendelian inheritance and that the two polar nuclei in the central cell are genetically identical, which of the following options represents the complete set of all possible genotypes for the endosperm tissue in the resulting seeds?\n\nA. $AAa, Aaa$\n\nB. $AAA, AA, aa$\n\nC. $AAa, Aaa, AA, Aa, aa$\n\nD. $AAA, AAa, Aaa, aaa$\n\nE. $AA, Aa, aa$", "solution": "In angiosperms, the endosperm is formed by the fusion of one sperm nucleus (haploid) with the two polar nuclei in the central cell. The two polar nuclei are haploid and, as specified, genetically identical because they derive from the same haploid megaspore that undergoes mitotic divisions during megagametogenesis. Therefore, before fertilization, the central cell effectively carries two identical haploid copies of the same allele; after fusion with a haploid sperm, the primary endosperm nucleus is triploid.\n\nLet the maternal plant genotype be $Aa$. By Mendelian segregation during gametogenesis:\n- The female gametophyte (embryo sac) is haploid with allele $A$ or $a$.\n- The two polar nuclei are genetically identical to each other and to the embryo sacâ€™s haploid genotype. Thus, the maternal contribution to the endosperm is either $AA$ (if the embryo sac is $A$) or $aa$ (if the embryo sac is $a$).\n- The male gametophyte (pollen) from the same $Aa$ plant produces sperm carrying allele $A$ or $a$.\n\nEnumerate all combinations for endosperm genotype (two identical maternal copies from the polar nuclei plus one paternal copy from the sperm):\n- If the embryo sac is $A$, the polar nuclei contribute $AA$; fertilization by sperm $A$ gives $AAA$, and by sperm $a$ gives $AAa$.\n- If the embryo sac is $a$, the polar nuclei contribute $aa$; fertilization by sperm $A$ gives $Aaa$, and by sperm $a$ gives $aaa$.\n\nThus, the complete set of possible triploid endosperm genotypes is {$AAA, AAa, Aaa, aaa$}, which corresponds to option D.\n\nAny options listing diploid genotypes (such as $AA$, $Aa$, $aa$) are invalid for endosperm, which is triploid, and any set omitting one of the four triploid possibilities is incomplete.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1744320"}, {"introduction": "The term \"double fertilization\" implies that both fertilization events are crucial for successful reproduction. This problem presents a thought experiment where the process is incomplete, challenging you to predict the developmental consequences.

The pollen tube delivers two haploid sperm nuclei (n) into the embryo sac. One sperm nucleus fuses with the haploid egg cell (n) to form a diploid zygote (2n), which develops into the embryo. The second sperm nucleus fuses with the diploid central cell (which contains two fused polar nuclei, n+n) to form a triploid endosperm (3n), a nutritive tissue essential for seed development.\n\nA botanist discovers a mutant strain of *M. singularis* where a genetic defect causes the pollen tube to successfully deliver only one functional sperm nucleus into the embryo sac. Assuming this single sperm nucleus is capable of fertilization and that all female gametes in the embryo sac are normal, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the developmental fate of the egg cell and the central cell after pollination?\n\nA. The central cell will be fertilized to form a diploid endosperm, but the egg cell will not be fertilized and will degenerate.\n\nB. The egg cell will be fertilized to form a viable diploid embryo, but the central cell will not be fertilized and will fail to develop into nutritive endosperm.\n\nC. The single sperm nucleus will undergo mitosis after entering the embryo sac, allowing for the normal formation of both a diploid embryo and a triploid endosperm.\n\nD. Both the egg cell and the central cell will degenerate because the absence of the second sperm nucleus prevents any fertilization event from initiating.\n\nE. The egg cell will develop parthenogenetically into a haploid embryo, and the single sperm nucleus will fertilize the central cell to form a diploid endosperm.", "solution": "The canonical angiosperm process of double fertilization involves two haploid sperm nuclei, each of ploidy $n$, delivered by the pollen tube into the embryo sac. One sperm fuses with the haploid egg cell ($n$) to form a diploid zygote ($2n$) that develops into the embryo, and the other sperm fuses with the diploid central cell (containing two fused polar nuclei, $n+n$) to form a triploid endosperm ($3n$) that provides nutritive support for seed development.\n\nIn the mutant described, only one functional sperm nucleus reaches the embryo sac. Therefore, at most one of the two fertilization events can occur.\n\nEvaluate each option against ploidy rules and developmental consequences:\n- If the single sperm fertilizes the central cell, the fusion is $n$ (sperm) with the central cell $(n+n)$, yielding $3n$ endosperm, not diploid. Thus, any outcome asserting a diploid endosperm from fertilization of a diploid central cell is incorrect. Therefore, option A is false due to incorrect ploidy (it claims diploid endosperm).\n- If the single sperm fertilizes the egg, the fusion $n + n \\to 2n$ produces a diploid zygote (a viable embryo initially), while the central cell remains unfertilized and therefore fails to develop into endosperm. This leads to absence of nutritive tissue, typically causing embryo abortion at later stages, but it correctly describes the immediate developmental fates. This matches option B.\n- Post-entry mitosis of the sperm nucleus to regenerate two functional sperm is not part of normal angiosperm fertilization; sperm cells are terminally differentiated gametes that do not undergo mitosis in the embryo sac. Hence, option C is not supported biologically.\n- The presence of one functional sperm suffices for at least one fertilization event; thus, it is incorrect to claim that both the egg and central cell will degenerate due to a complete absence of fertilization. Therefore, option D is false.\n- Parthenogenetic development of the egg and formation of a diploid endosperm from fertilization of a diploid central cell are not implied by the problem. Moreover, fertilization of a diploid central cell by a haploid sperm would yield a triploid ($3n$), not diploid, endosperm. Hence, option E is incorrect both mechanistically and by ploidy.\n\nTherefore, the only outcome consistent with the given constraints and correct ploidy is that the egg is fertilized to form a diploid embryo, while the central cell is not fertilized and fails to develop into nutritive endosperm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1744365"}]}
