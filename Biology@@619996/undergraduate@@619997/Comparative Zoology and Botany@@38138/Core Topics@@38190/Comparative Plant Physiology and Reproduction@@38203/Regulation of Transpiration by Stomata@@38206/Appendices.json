The primary mechanism for water conservation in plants is the closing of stomata, the small pores on the leaf surface responsible for gas exchange. To quantify this response, the physiologist models the stomatal pore as a perfect ellipse.\n\nUnder well-watered (turgid) conditions, a typical stomatal pore has a major axis of length $L_t = 20.0$ micrometers and a minor axis of length $W_t = 5.00$ micrometers. After a period of drought, the leaves become water-stressed (wilted), and the pore dimensions change. In the wilted state, the major axis length is $L_w = 18.0$ micrometers, and the minor axis length is $W_w = 0.500$ micrometers.\n\nAssuming that the rate of transpiration (water loss through diffusion) for the entire leaf is directly proportional to the total area of all stomatal pores, calculate the ratio of the total transpiration rate of the wilted leaf to that of the turgid leaf.
