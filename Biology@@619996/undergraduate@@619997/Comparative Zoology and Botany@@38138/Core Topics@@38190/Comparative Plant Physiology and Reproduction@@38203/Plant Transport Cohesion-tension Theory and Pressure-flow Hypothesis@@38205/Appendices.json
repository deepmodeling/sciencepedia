Initially, under well-watered conditions, the cell is in hydraulic equilibrium with the adjacent xylem, which has a water potential ($\\Psi$) of -0.50 MPa. The cell's solute potential ($\\Psi_s$) in this state is -0.80 MPa.\n\nThe plant is then subjected to a period of mild water stress. In response, two changes occur. First, the water potential of the xylem decreases to a new, stable value of -0.70 MPa. Second, the parenchyma cell actively increases its internal solute concentration, causing its solute potential to drop to -1.10 MPa. In this new state of water stress, a steady flow of water is established from the xylem into the parenchyma cell, driven by a net water potential difference of 0.05 MPa between the two.\n\nCalculate the final turgor pressure (pressure potential, $\\Psi_p$) inside the parenchyma cell under these mild water stress conditions.

They synthesize a novel experimental compound, which they call \"SucroStop,\" that acts as a highly specific inhibitor. When applied to the leaves of a plant, which act as the \"source\" of sugar production, SucroStop is observed to completely and exclusively block the action of the H+-ATPase proton pumps located on the plasma membranes of the companion cells.

The active transport of sucrose from the apoplast into the companion cells will be severely impaired.\n\nE. The concentration of protons (H+) inside the companion cells will decrease significantly.", "solution": "Phloem loading at source leaves in many plants uses an apoplastic loading mechanism in which the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$-ATPase of companion cells extrudes protons to the apoplast, establishing a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient (proton motive force) that drives secondary active sucrose uptake via $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$/sucrose symporters (SUT/SUC) on the companion cell membrane.\n\nThe relevant physical description is that the proton electrochemical potential difference across the companion cell plasma membrane is\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}} = RT \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]_{\\text{in}}}{[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]_{\\text{out}}}\\right) + zF \\Delta \\psi,\n$$\nwith $z=+1$ for $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$, where $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is absolute temperature, $F$ is Faradayâ€™s constant, and $\\Delta \\psi$ is the transmembrane electrical potential (cytosol relative to apoplast). The $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$-ATPase uses ATP hydrolysis to pump $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$ out, decreasing $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]_{\\text{out}}$ in the apoplast and hyperpolarizing the membrane (more negative cytosol), thereby making $\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}}$ strongly favorable for proton influx. The sucrose symporter couples sucrose import to $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$ influx so that the sucrose flux $J_{\\text{suc}}$ depends directly on the magnitude of $\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}}$ (i.e., $J_{\\text{suc}} \\propto f(\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}})$ for the symport mechanism).\n\nApplying SucroStop specifically blocks the $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$-ATPase on companion cells. Immediately upon inhibition, outward proton pumping ceases, so the proton motive force decays toward zero because both the pH gradient and the electrical component cannot be maintained without active pumping. As $\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}}$ collapses, the driving force for the $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$/sucrose symporter vanishes, and secondary active uptake of sucrose from the apoplast into companion cells is severely impaired.\n\nConsequences for the answer choices follow:\n- A: A decrease in hydrostatic pressure in sieve-tube elements could occur secondarily if sucrose loading and thus water influx decrease, but this is not the most immediate and direct effect; it is downstream of impaired loading.\n- B: Sucrose movement from companion cells into sieve-tube elements is predominantly symplastic via plasmodesmata and does not rely on membrane $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$-ATPases for active transport; thus it would not be directly halted by the pump inhibition.\n- C: Photosynthesis in mesophyll cells is stated to be unaffected by the compound; moreover, companion cell $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$-ATPase inhibition does not directly target mesophyll photosynthetic machinery.\n- D: This precisely describes the immediate, direct effect: collapse of the proton motive force disables the $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$/sucrose symporters responsible for apoplastic loading into companion cells.\n- E: Blocking the $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$-ATPase would not decrease cytosolic $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$; if anything, reduced proton efflux would tend to increase or maintain cytosolic $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$, and the reduced symporter activity would also reduce proton influx. A significant decrease is not the immediate consequence.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and direct consequence is severe impairment of active sucrose transport from the apoplast into companion cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1767501"}, {"introduction": "While the cohesion-tension theory explains how water is pulled up the xylem, the structure of the xylem itself reflects a critical evolutionary compromise between transport efficiency and safety from catastrophic failure.

Consider two hypothetical plant species, Species A adapted to a consistently moist environment and Species B adapted to a drought-prone environment. Species A has evolved wider xylem vessels of radius $r_A$, while Species B has narrower vessels of radius $r_B$.\n\nThe hydraulic conductance ($K_h$), a measure of the ease of water flow, for a single vessel is well-described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$K_h = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8 \\eta}$$\nwhere $r$ is the vessel radius and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the sap.\n\nThe vulnerability to cavitation is determined by the critical negative pressure (tension), $\\Delta P_{crit}$, at which air is pulled from an adjacent air-filled space into a water-filled vessel, causing an embolism.
