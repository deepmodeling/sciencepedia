The analysis focuses on two idealized models: an anemochorous (wind-dispersed) seed and a hydrochorous (water-dispersed) seed. Both are designed to carry an identical payload mass, $m_p$, consisting of the embryo and endosperm.\n\n**Model A (Anemochory):** The wind-dispersed seed is a flat, uniform disk (a samara) of total mass $m_A$ and area $A_A$. The total mass is the sum of the payload mass $m_p$ and the structural mass of the wing, $m_{s,A}$. The structural mass is assumed to be directly proportional to the wing's area, given by $m_{s,A} = \\sigma A_A$, where $\\sigma$ is the surface mass density of the wing material. The seed is designed to achieve a specific terminal velocity, $v_T$, in vertical descent through air of density $\\rho_{air}$. The aerodynamic drag force is given by $F_D = \\frac{1}{2} C_D \\rho_{air} A_A v^2$, where $C_D$ is the drag coefficient and $v$ is the speed of the seed.\n\n**Model H (Hydrochory):** The water-dispersed seed is a spherical drupe of total mass $m_H$ and total volume $V_H$. The total mass is the sum of the payload mass $m_p$ and the structural mass of the buoyant husk, $m_{s,H}$. The structural mass is provided by a fibrous material of uniform density $\\rho_s$ that fills the entire volume, so $m_{s,H} = \\rho_s V_H$. The seed is designed to be neutrally buoyant in seawater of density $\\rho_{sw}$.\n\nAssuming the acceleration due to gravity is $g$, determine the ratio of the total mass of the hydrochorous seed to the total mass of the anemochorous seed, $\\frac{m_H}{m_A}$.

The seeds of this plant possess small, wing-like structures, suggesting they might be dispersed by wind (anemochory), but their proximity to water also suggests dispersal by river currents (hydrochory). To quantify the relative importance of these two mechanisms, two simple experiments are conducted.\n\nFirst, a set of seeds are dropped in a controlled, windless environment from a height. Their fall time is measured, and their average terminal velocity in air is determined to be $v_t = 0.75$ m/s.\n\nSecond, another set of seeds are placed in a tank of fresh water. It is observed that, on average, a seed remains buoyant for a time of $T_{float} = 18.0$ hours before it becomes waterlogged and sinks.\n\nThe typical habitat of *Ventusflumen riparium* has the following characteristics: the average height of a mature plant (and thus the seed release height) is $h = 2.0$ m, the typical wind speed is $v_{wind} = 3.0$ m/s, and the typical river surface current is $v_{river} = 1.2$ m/s.\n\nLet $d_{wind}$ be the characteristic horizontal distance a seed travels via wind, assuming it is released from height $h$ and travels in a constant horizontal wind $v_{wind}$ until it hits the ground.

Two distinct phenotypes of this species, P1 and P2, have evolved different dispersal strategies.\n\n**Phenotype P1 (Specialist Autochore):** This phenotype utilizes a single, powerful explosive mechanism (autochory). The final landing position, $x$, of a seed is a random variable uniformly distributed over the interval $[-D_1, D_1]$.\n\n**Phenotype P2 (Diplochore):** This phenotype uses a less powerful explosive primary dispersal followed by a secondary dispersal via water (hydrochory).\n1.  **Primary Dispersal (Autochory):** A seed's position after the initial explosion is uniformly distributed over a smaller interval $[-D_2, D_2]$.\n2.  **Secondary Dispersal (Hydrochory):** The habitat is adjacent to a river flowing in the positive x-direction. Any seed whose primary dispersal lands it in the positive region, $(0, D_2]$, is immediately carried by the river an additional fixed distance $L$ downstream (in the positive x-direction). Seeds landing in the negative region, $[-D_2, 0]$, are not affected by the river and remain at their primary landing site.\n\nA dispersal event is defined as a \"successful long-distance colonization\" if the seed's final position, $x_f$, is farther than a critical distance $d_c$ from the parent plant, i.e., $|x_f| > d_c$.
