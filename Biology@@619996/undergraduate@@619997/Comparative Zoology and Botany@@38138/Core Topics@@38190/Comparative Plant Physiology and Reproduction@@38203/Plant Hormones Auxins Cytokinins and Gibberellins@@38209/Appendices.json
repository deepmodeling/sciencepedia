{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "One of the most powerful methods in biology for understanding a component's function is to observe the system when that component is missing or non-functional. This thought experiment applies that logic to plant hormones. By imagining a plant with a defective auxin receptor, we can deduce the fundamental roles that auxin plays in orchestrating plant architecture. This practice will challenge you to predict the widespread consequences of losing all auxin signaling, touching upon key processes like apical dominance and the formation of adventitious roots [@problem_id:1765069].", "problem": "A plant biologist is studying the genetic basis of plant architecture. They discover a novel mutant strain of a common herbaceous plant. Through molecular analysis, they determine that this mutant possesses a single gene defect that results in the synthesis of a non-functional auxin receptor protein. This defective receptor is expressed in all tissues where the wild-type receptor would normally be found, but it is completely unable to bind to its ligand, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the primary native auxin.\n\nAssuming all other hormone signaling pathways (e.g., for cytokinins and gibberellins) are initially normal, which of the following phenotypes is most likely to be observed in this mutant plant compared to its wild-type counterpart?\n\nA. Enhanced apical dominance, leading to a taller, less branched plant, and a significant increase in adventitious root formation on stem cuttings.\n\nB. A complete loss of apical dominance, resulting in a bushy, highly branched phenotype, and a severe impairment of adventitious root formation on stem cuttings.\n\nC. A dwarf phenotype with shortened internodes, but with normal apical dominance and normal adventitious root formation.\n\nD. Excessive elongation of the main stem, a loss of apical dominance, but with a normal capacity for adventitious root formation.\n\nE. Enhanced apical dominance, but a complete inability to form adventitious roots on stem cuttings.", "solution": "The mutant expresses a non-functional auxin receptor in all tissues, which cannot bind indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Hormone action requires ligand-receptor binding to initiate signal transduction; therefore, if the receptor cannot bind IAA, auxin signaling is effectively abolished throughout the plant.\n\nAuxinâ€™s major roles relevant here include:\n1) Maintenance of apical dominance: In wild-type shoots, auxin produced by the apical meristem moves basipetally and suppresses axillary bud outgrowth, in part via interactions that promote strigolactone signaling and suppress cytokinin effects in buds. If auxin cannot be perceived, this inhibitory signal fails in axillary buds and stem tissues, leading to loss of apical dominance and increased lateral branching (a bushy phenotype).\n\n2) Adventitious root formation: Auxin is necessary and typically sufficient to induce adventitious root initiation on stem cuttings. Without auxin perception, the transcriptional and cellular programs for root initiation cannot be activated, resulting in severely impaired adventitious root formation.\n\n3) Stem elongation: Auxin promotes cell elongation via the acid growth mechanism and auxin-responsive gene expression. Loss of auxin signaling generally reduces elongation (dwarfing). Although this aspect is not required to select among the options, it helps eliminate choices that propose excessive elongation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A and E (enhanced apical dominance) require heightened auxin signaling or sensitivity, which contradicts a null auxin perception state.\n- D (excessive elongation and normal rooting) contradicts the expected reduction in elongation and the required role of auxin in adventitious rooting.\n- C includes dwarfism but incorrectly claims normal apical dominance and rooting, both of which require auxin perception.\n- B correctly predicts loss of apical dominance (bushy, highly branched) and severely impaired adventitious root formation, matching the consequences of a global loss of auxin signaling.\n\nTherefore, B is the most consistent phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1765069"}, {"introduction": "Plant development is often governed not by a single hormone, but by the relative balance between several. Building on the concept of apical dominance, which is maintained by auxin, this exercise explores the direct antagonistic relationship between auxin and cytokinin. You will analyze a scenario where a dormant bud is directly treated with cytokinin, tasking you with predicting how this local change can override the plant-wide suppressive signal from the apex. This practice highlights the critical role of the auxin-to-cytokinin ratio in developmental decision-making, such as whether a bud grows into a branch [@problem_id:1765054].", "problem": "In an experimental setup, a healthy, intact bean plant (*Phaseolus vulgaris*) is grown under optimal conditions for vegetative growth. The apical bud at the top of the main stem is left undisturbed, ensuring it is actively producing hormones. A botanist prepares a solution with a high concentration of zeatin, a naturally occurring cytokinin, and directly and repeatedly applies it to a single, dormant axillary (lateral) bud located midway down the main stem. All other parts of the plant are left untouched.\n\nAssuming the plant remains otherwise healthy and the zeatin concentration is stimulatory but not toxic, what is the most likely developmental outcome for the treated axillary bud?\n\nA. The treated axillary bud will show no change and remain dormant.\n\nB. The entire plant will senesce (age and deteriorate) prematurely, starting from the leaves nearest the treated bud.\n\nC. The treated axillary bud will be released from dormancy and grow into a lateral branch.\n\nD. The section of the main stem just below the treated bud will exhibit significant elongation (internode stretching) without the bud itself growing.\n\nE. The treated axillary bud will immediately differentiate into a flower.", "solution": "1. Identify the relevant hormonal controls on axillary bud outgrowth. In intact shoots with an active apical bud, basipetal auxin transport from the shoot apex enforces apical dominance, suppressing axillary (lateral) buds. Thus, under control conditions, a mid-stem axillary bud remains dormant due to auxin-mediated suppression.\n\n2. Recall the principal actions of cytokinins, specifically zeatin. Cytokinins promote cell division and can release axillary buds from apical dominance. They act antagonistically to auxin with respect to axillary bud outgrowth: increasing cytokinin relative to auxin at the bud favors activation of the bud meristem and shoot initiation.\n\n3. Analyze the experimental manipulation. Direct, repeated application of zeatin at high but non-toxic, stimulatory concentration specifically to a single dormant axillary bud will elevate cytokinin signaling locally at that bud without altering the rest of the plant. This raises the local cytokinin to auxin balance at the treated site, effectively increasing the local ratio $R_{\\text{CK:IAA}}$ at the bud.\n\n4. Deduce the local developmental consequence at the treated bud. An increased $R_{\\text{CK:IAA}}$ at the axillary bud counteracts apical dominance locally, activating the cell cycle in the bud meristem, breaking dormancy, and initiating outgrowth. This results in vegetative shoot development from that bud, forming a lateral branch.\n\n5. Exclude alternative outcomes based on cytokinin physiology:\n- No change (Option A) is unlikely because exogenous cytokinin applied directly to a dormant bud is a classic treatment to overcome apical dominance locally.\n- Premature senescence (Option B) contradicts cytokinin function; cytokinins delay leaf senescence rather than induce it.\n- Internode elongation below the bud without bud outgrowth (Option D) is more characteristic of gibberellin or auxin effects; cytokinins primarily stimulate cell division and bud activation rather than promoting isolated internode elongation in this context.\n- Immediate floral differentiation (Option E) is not the typical response of an axillary bud to cytokinin in an intact, vegetatively growing bean plant; floral induction involves additional systemic signals (e.g., photoperiodic pathways and florigen), and cytokinin application to a single bud is expected to promote vegetative branching.\n\n6. Therefore, the most likely developmental outcome for the treated axillary bud is release from dormancy and vegetative outgrowth into a lateral branch.\n\nConclusion: Option C is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1765054"}, {"introduction": "Beyond regulating growth and branching, hormones are also key players in managing the life cycle of plant organs, including the process of aging or senescence. This hands-on scenario recreates a classic experiment that demonstrates cytokinin's role as an anti-aging agent for plant tissues. By predicting the outcome for a detached leaf partially treated with cytokinin, you will explore the famous Richmond-Lang effect, visualizing how this hormone class helps maintain cellular health and postpone the breakdown of chlorophyll [@problem_id:1765066].", "problem": "A botany student conducts an experiment on a single, healthy, mature spinach leaf recently detached from the plant. The student carefully applies a thin, waterproof, inert barrier along the entire length of the leaf's central midrib, effectively isolating the two halves. The student then paints the top surface of one half of the leaf with a solution containing a synthetic cytokinin (kinetin). The other half is painted with an identical solution that lacks the cytokinin, serving as a control. The entire leaf is then placed on a moist filter paper inside a sealed, light-proof container and is kept at room temperature for two weeks.\n\nAssuming the leaf does not desiccate or become infected by microbes, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected visual state of the leaf after the two-week period?\n\nA. The half treated with cytokinin will be yellow and withered, while the untreated control half will remain green.\n\nB. The half treated with cytokinin will remain largely green, while the untreated control half will turn yellow.\n\nC. Both halves of the leaf will turn yellow at approximately the same rate.\n\nD. The half treated with cytokinin will develop numerous small, adventitious roots.\n\nE. The half treated with cytokinin will show a noticeable increase in surface area compared to the control half.", "solution": "The experimental design isolates two halves of a detached, mature spinach leaf by placing a waterproof barrier along the midrib, preventing vascular and apoplastic exchange between halves. One half receives exogenous cytokinin (kinetin) on the upper surface; the other half receives a cytokinin-free control solution. The leaf is kept moist, sealed, and in complete darkness at room temperature for two weeks, so it does not desiccate and is not photosynthesizing.\n\nPrinciple of leaf senescence: Once detached from the plant and kept in darkness, a mature leaf undergoes senescence. Key features include degradation of chlorophyll and proteins, leading to visible yellowing. In intact plants, endogenous cytokinins synthesized primarily in roots and transported via xylem delay senescence. In a detached leaf deprived of that source, senescence proceeds unless counteracted by exogenous cytokinin.\n\nCytokinin action (Richmond-Lang effect): Exogenous cytokinins delay senescence by maintaining chlorophyll and protein content, stabilizing photosynthetic apparatus, and mobilizing nutrients to treated tissue. This results in retention of green coloration in treated regions compared to untreated regions under identical stress conditions (darkness and detachment).\n\nRole of the midrib barrier: The waterproof barrier prevents lateral movement of the applied cytokinin across the midrib, ensuring that any effect remains confined to the treated half and does not rescue the control half.\n\nPredictions and evaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because cytokinin does not promote yellowing; it retards senescence.\n- B is correct: the cytokinin-treated half will remain largely green (delayed senescence), while the untreated control half will yellow due to senescence in darkness.\n- C is incorrect because the differential presence of cytokinin will produce different senescence rates.\n- D is incorrect: adventitious root formation is promoted by auxin, not cytokinin, and a mature leaf blade in darkness would not develop numerous roots from cytokinin application.\n- E is incorrect: cytokinins primarily promote cell division in meristematic tissues and delay senescence; they do not appreciably increase the surface area of a mature leaf half, especially in darkness where growth is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate expected visual outcome is that the cytokinin-treated half remains largely green while the untreated half turns yellow.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1765066"}]}
