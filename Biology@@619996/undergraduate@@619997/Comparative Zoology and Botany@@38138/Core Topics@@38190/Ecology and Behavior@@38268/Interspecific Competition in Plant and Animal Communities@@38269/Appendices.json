By working through this problem, you will learn how the competition coefficient, $\\alpha$, directly translates the population of a competing species into a reduction of the environment's carrying capacity for the focal species.", "problem": "In an ecological study of a grassland ecosystem, two species of perennial grasses, Species A (a native species) and Species B (an invasive species), are observed to be in competition for shared resources like water and soil nutrients. The population dynamics of Species A are described by a logistic growth model that is modified to account for the competitive pressure from Species B.\n\nThe model dictates that the per capita growth rate of Species A becomes zero when the combined competitive load on the environment reaches Species A's carrying capacity. This total competitive load is quantified as an \"effective population size\" of Species A. This effective population is calculated as the actual population of Species A, denoted by $N_A$, plus the population of Species B, denoted by $N_B$, where each individual of Species B is weighted by a competition coefficient, $\\alpha_{AB}$. This coefficient, $\\alpha_{AB}$, represents the per capita competitive effect of an individual of Species B on Species A relative to the effect of an individual of Species A on its own population.\n\nField measurements have established the following parameters:\n- The carrying capacity of the habitat for Species A in the complete absence of Species B is $K_A = 4800$ individual plants.\n- The competition coefficient representing the impact of Species B on Species A is $\\alpha_{AB} = 0.60$.\n- A stable, persistent population of the invasive Species B has established itself in the area, with a constant population size of $N_B = 2500$ individual plants.\n\nAssuming the system has reached a state where the population of Species A is stable (i.e., its population growth rate is zero), calculate the equilibrium population size of Species A that can coexist with the established population of Species B. Express your answer as a number of individual plants.", "solution": "The problem describes the population dynamics of Species A in the presence of a competitor, Species B, using a modified logistic growth model. The core principle stated is that the population of Species A stabilizes (i.e., its growth rate, $\\frac{dN_A}{dt}$, becomes zero) when the total competitive load equals its carrying capacity, $K_A$.\n\nThe total competitive load, or \"effective population size,\" is given by the expression $N_A + \\alpha_{AB} N_B$. Here, $N_A$ is the population of Species A, $N_B$ is the population of Species B, and $\\alpha_{AB}$ is the competition coefficient that translates individuals of Species B into equivalent competitive units of Species A.\n\nThe condition for a stable equilibrium population of Species A is that its per capita growth rate is zero. This occurs when the effective population size equals the carrying capacity:\n$$N_{A, \\text{effective}} = K_A$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for the effective population size, we get:\n$$N_A + \\alpha_{AB} N_B = K_A$$\n\nWe are asked to find the equilibrium population size of Species A, which we can denote as $N_{A, \\text{eq}}$. This is the value of $N_A$ that satisfies the equation above when the system is stable. We can solve for $N_A$ by rearranging the equation:\n$$N_{A, \\text{eq}} = K_A - \\alpha_{AB} N_B$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this equation:\n- Carrying capacity for Species A, $K_A = 4800$ individuals.\n- Competition coefficient, $\\alpha_{AB} = 0.60$.\n- Population of the competitor Species B, $N_B = 2500$ individuals.\n\nPlugging these values into the derived formula:\n$$N_{A, \\text{eq}} = 4800 - (0.60) \\times (2500)$$\n\nFirst, calculate the competitive effect of Species B in terms of Species A individuals:\n$$\\text{Competitive effect} = 0.60 \\times 2500 = 1500$$\nThis means that the population of 2500 individuals of Species B has a competitive impact on Species A that is equivalent to having an additional 1500 individuals of Species A.\n\nNow, subtract this competitive effect from the carrying capacity of Species A to find the equilibrium population of Species A:\n$$N_{A, \\text{eq}} = 4800 - 1500$$\n$$N_{A, \\text{eq}} = 3300$$\n\nThus, the equilibrium population size of Species A that can coexist with 2500 individuals of Species B is 3300 plants.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3300}$$", "id": "1753160"}, {"introduction": "The Lotka-Volterra model's competition coefficients ($\\alpha$) are powerful but abstract.
