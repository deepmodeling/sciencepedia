The focus is a 10.0-hectare field that is left fallow over a 90-day winter period. The farmer is considering two alternative ecological management strategies to enhance soil fertility for the next growing season. Your task is to quantify the nutrient inputs from each strategy.\n\n**Scenario 1: The Starling Roost**\nA massive migratory flock of 5.00 x 10^5 European starlings (*Sturnus vulgaris*) establishes a winter roost in the trees bordering the field. The birds forage in a wide surrounding area but return to roost over the field each night for the entire 90-day period.\n- Each starling deposits an average of 2.50 grams of dry guano per day within the 10.0-hectare field.\n- The dry guano has a nutrient composition of 5.00% nitrogen (N) by mass and 1.50% phosphorus (P) by mass.\n\n**Scenario 2: The Cover Crop**\nInstead of allowing the starlings to roost, the farmer could plant a nitrogen-fixing cover crop, such as winter vetch (*Vicia villosa*), at the beginning of the 90-day period.\n- The vetch is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen at a rate of 40.0 kilograms of N per hectare over the 90-day growth period.\n- The cover crop primarily accesses phosphorus already present in the soil. For this analysis, assume that planting the cover crop results in no net addition of new phosphorus to the total soil-plant system of the field; it only cycles the existing phosphorus.\n\nCalculate the total mass of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) added to the entire 10.0-hectare field under each scenario. Present your final answer as a 2x2 matrix where the first row contains the mass of N and P (in that order) from the starling scenario, and the second row contains the mass of N and P from the cover crop scenario.
