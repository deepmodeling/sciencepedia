This first practice explores the powerful concept of a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade, where the mere presence or perceived risk of a predator can dramatically alter an ecosystem.

The study focuses on a population of white-tailed deer within a defined research area. Under normal conditions, without any perceived threats, the deer population consists of $N_D = 50$ individuals, and each deer is observed to browse an average of $R_B = 10$ aspen saplings per day.\n\nTo investigate the non-lethal effects of predators, the ecologist introduces the scent of wolves, the deer's natural predator, throughout the area. This experimental manipulation creates a \"landscape of fear,\" which does not directly harm the deer but causes them to become more vigilant and reduce their time spent foraging. This behavioral modification results in a 60% reduction in the daily browsing rate for each deer.\n\nAssuming the deer population remains constant and this fear-induced behavior is consistently maintained over a study period of $T = 14$ days, calculate the total number of aspen saplings that are saved from being browsed due to this behavioral cascade.", "solution": "Let the baseline daily browsing per deer be $R_{B}$ and the number of deer be $N_{D}$.

The herbicide has no direct effect on the algae but impairs the motor functions of the tadpoles, reducing their foraging effectiveness. This sublethal effect is quantified as a 35% reduction in their consumption rate constant, $c$.\n\nCalculate the new equilibrium biomass density of the algae after the herbicide has taken effect and the system has settled into its new steady state.

In this initial state, the pika population is 250 individuals, and the wildflower population is stable at 12,500 plants. The stability of the wildflower population implies that its intrinsic per-capita growth rate is exactly balanced by the mortality rate from pika grazing, which is directly proportional to the size of the pika population.\n\nAn invasive species of grass, *Gramen externus*, is introduced to the island. It is highly successful and establishes a large, stable population of 3,550 plants. The pikas can also eat this grass. The carrying capacity of the pika population is directly proportional to the total food energy available from all plant sources. The invasive grass is a superior food source; the energy content of a single *Gramen externus* plant is 2.2 times the energy content of a single *Flora nativus* plant.\n\nAfter the introduction of the invasive grass, the ecosystem eventually settles into a new equilibrium.
