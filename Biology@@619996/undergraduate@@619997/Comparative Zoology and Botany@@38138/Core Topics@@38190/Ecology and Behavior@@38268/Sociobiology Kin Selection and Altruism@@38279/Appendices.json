This first exercise [@problem_id:1775125] provides practice in calculating $r$ for a direct-lineage relationship in a standard diploid species, a foundational skill for any analysis of social evolution.", "problem": "In sociobiological studies, the evolution of altruism can often be explained by kin selection, a concept formalized by Hamilton's rule, which depends on the coefficient of relatedness ($r$) between individuals. The coefficient of relatedness is defined as the probability that a gene picked randomly from each of two individuals is identical by descent.\n\nConsider a hypothetical, long-lived, diploid, and sexually reproducing species that is not inbred. In this species, individuals often survive long enough to interact with several generations of their descendants. An elderly individual (the great-grandparent) is observed performing a potentially altruistic act towards one of its great-grandchildren. To analyze this behavior using the framework of kin selection, one must first determine the coefficient of relatedness between the two.\n\nWhat is the coefficient of relatedness ($r$) between the great-grandparent and its great-grandchild?\n\nA. $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nB. $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nC. $\\frac{1}{8}$\n\nD. $\\frac{1}{16}$\n\nE. $\\frac{1}{32}$", "solution": "We aim to compute the coefficient of relatedness $r$ between a great-grandparent and a great-grandchild in a diploid, sexually reproducing, non-inbred species.

Consuming the fruit would provide a significant fitness benefit to the recipient, quantified as an increase of $B = 1.10$ in their expected number of offspring. However, foregoing the fruit imposes a fitness cost on the altruistic individual, quantified as a decrease of $C = 0.35$ in their own expected number of offspring.\n\nIn this species, individuals are diploid and reproduce sexually.
