{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The evolution of mating systems is fundamentally about maximizing reproductive success under specific ecological constraints. This first exercise explores a powerful selective force that can favor the evolution of monogamy: the necessity of biparental care. By analyzing a scenario where environmental changes dramatically increase the energetic demands of raising offspring, you will explore the fitness payoffs of different male and female strategies, revealing why abandoning a solitary lifestyle for a cooperative pair bond can become an evolutionary imperative [@problem_id:1755535].", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, mating systems describe the patterns of mating and parental care within a species. The evolution of these systems is heavily influenced by ecological pressures and the energetic requirements of reproduction. Key systems include: **Polygyny**, where one male mates with multiple females; **Polyandry**, where one female mates with multiple males; and **Monogamy**, where one male and one female form a pair bond and often cooperate in raising offspring.\n\nConsider a hypothetical species of solitary, herbivorous mammal. Historically, food resources were abundant, and females were able to independently acquire sufficient energy for both gestation and lactation. Consequently, males provided no parental care, and individuals lived and foraged alone outside of brief mating encounters.\n\nA sudden, permanent environmental shift occurs, leading to a significant decrease in the nutritional quality of the available vegetation. As a result, the energetic cost of producing milk has effectively doubled for lactating females. A female can no longer gather enough food for herself and her offspring while also providing the necessary protection and warmth for the young. Without assistance, offspring mortality in the first few weeks after birth has risen to nearly 100%. However, if a second adult consistently provides food to the female and/or the offspring, the young have a high chance of survival.\n\nGiven this new, intense selective pressure, which mating system is most likely to be favored by natural selection and become dominant in this population over many generations?\n\nA. Polygyny, as this strategy allows a successful male to maximize his number of potential offspring.\n\nB. A continuation of the ancestral solitary, non-parental care system, as evolutionary change is slow.\n\nC. Monogamy, where a male provides dedicated parental care to a single female and her brood.\n\nD. Polyandry, where the female mates with multiple males to confuse paternity and prevent infanticide.", "solution": "1) State the core evolutionary principle. Natural selection favors strategies that maximize expected reproductive success (fitness). For mating systems, the Emlen-Oring framework and parental investment theory predict that ecological constraints on resource acquisition and the dependence of offspring survival on parental care shape whether polygyny, monogamy, or polyandry is favored.\n\n2) Translate the ecological shift into fitness parameters. Let $m$ be the number of offspring produced per breeding attempt by a female. Let $S_{0}$ be the survival probability of offspring when the female receives no consistent assistance; the problem states that offspring mortality is nearly total, so $S_{0}\\approx 0$. Let $S_{1}$ be the survival probability when a second adult consistently provisions the female and/or offspring; the problem states this is high, so $S_{1}\\gg S_{0}$ with $0<S_{1}\\le 1$. Energetic and time constraints implied by doubled lactation costs and solitary ecology mean one adult cannot effectively provision multiple broods simultaneously; thus, sustained care is effectively limited to one breeding unit at a time.\n\n3) Compare male fitness payoffs under candidate systems.\n- Polygyny without paternal care: If a male mates with $k$ females but provides no sustained care (as per the ancestral system), each female’s offspring survive with probability $S_{0}\\approx 0$. The male’s expected surviving offspring is\n$$\nW_{M}^{\\text{polygyny}}=k\\,m\\,S_{0}\\approx 0.\n$$\n- Monogamy with dedicated male care: If a male pairs with one female and provides sustained provisioning, offspring survival is $S_{1}$. The male’s expected surviving offspring is\n$$\nW_{M}^{\\text{monogamy}}=m\\,S_{1}>0.\n$$\nGiven $S_{1}\\gg S_{0}$ and care being effectively indivisible across multiple broods, we have\n$$\nW_{M}^{\\text{monogamy}}>W_{M}^{\\text{polygyny}}.\n$$\n\n4) Compare female fitness payoffs. A female without assistance has fitness\n$$\nW_{F}^{\\text{solitary}}=m\\,S_{0}\\approx 0,\n$$\nwhereas with a dedicated helper (a monogamous partner) she attains\n$$\nW_{F}^{\\text{monogamy}}=m\\,S_{1}>0.\n$$\nThus, strong selection favors females that secure consistent help from a single male.\n\n5) Evaluate polyandry. Polyandry can sometimes reduce infanticide via paternity confusion, but the limiting factor here is provisioning, not male infanticide. Moreover, paternal care typically scales with paternity certainty. Let $p$ denote paternity certainty; under polyandry $p$ is low, reducing expected male effort, so sustained provisioning sufficient to achieve $S_{1}$ is unlikely. Therefore, expected offspring survival under polyandry remains near $S_{0}$ if male care is not reliably provided, yielding no advantage over monogamy in this ecological context.\n\n6) Rule out inertia. The option that evolution will not respond (continuation of the ancestral system) is inconsistent with the described intense selection: when $S_{0}\\approx 0$ and $S_{1}$ is high, genotypes and behaviors that produce monogamous, biparental care will spread rapidly because they confer a large fitness advantage.\n\n7) Synthesize prediction. Under the new environment, offspring survival is contingent on consistent biparental care; males cannot productively spread care across multiple females; females benefit from securing a single committed caregiver; and paternity certainty promotes male investment. These conditions jointly predict the evolution and dominance of monogamy with dedicated male parental care.\n\nTherefore, the mating system most likely to be favored is monogamy with male parental care.\n\nOptions assessment:\n- A (Polygyny): Not favored because care cannot be effectively divided and offspring without care nearly all die.\n- B (No change): Not favored due to strong selection against strategies yielding $S_{0}\\approx 0$.\n- C (Monogamy with male care): Matches the predicted ESS under high need for biparental care.\n- D (Polyandry): Does not solve the provisioning bottleneck and reduces paternity certainty, undermining male care.\n\nHence, C is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1755535"}, {"introduction": "While some environments select for monogamy, others create opportunities for polygyny, where one individual mates with multiple partners. This problem introduces a classic scenario for the evolution of resource-defense polygyny, guided by the principles of the Emlen-Oring socioecological model. You will examine how a patchy, uneven distribution of high-quality territories can lead females to achieve greater reproductive success by mating with an already-paired male in a prime location, a concept at the core of the polygyny threshold model [@problem_id:1755552].", "problem": "In a population of a hypothetical bird species, the Crimson-crested Reed-warbler, males establish and defend breeding territories along a riverbank. The quality of these territories varies significantly; some are resource-rich with abundant insect life and well-concealed nesting sites, while others are resource-poor and more exposed to predators. Extensive field studies have shown that a female's reproductive success (the number of chicks she successfully fledges) is almost entirely determined by the quality of the territory in which she nests, rather than any intrinsic quality of the male himself. Females survey multiple territories before selecting a mate. Given this strong selective pressure where female mate choice is driven primarily by the benefits of a high-quality territory, which of the following mating systems is most likely to evolve in the Crimson-crested Reed-warbler?\n\nA. Monogamy, where one male and one female form an exclusive pair bond for a breeding season.\n\nB.

Lek polygyny, where males gather at a communal display area to attract females, but do not provide any territory or parental care.\n\nE. Serial monogamy, where individuals have only one partner at any one time, but have different partners in different breeding seasons.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the fitness currency and causal driver. Let a female’s reproductive success be $F$, and let territory quality be $Q$. The problem states that $F$ is almost entirely a function of $Q$ and not of male intrinsic quality, so we write $F=F(Q)$ and assume $\\frac{dF}{dQ}>0$.\n\nStep 2: Establish ecological preconditions. There is substantial spatial variation in $Q$ along the riverbank, and males establish and defend territories. Therefore, high-$Q$ patches are discrete, defendable resources that can be monopolized by males.\n\nStep 3: Female choice rule. Females survey multiple territories and choose locations that maximize $F(Q)$. If multiple females can obtain high $F(Q)$ within a single male’s defended area (i.e., the defended resource is sufficiently extensive or productive), then several females will select the same high-$Q$ territory even if it entails sharing a male.\n\nStep 4: Male fitness strategy. Because $F$ depends on $Q$ rather than male intrinsic traits, male reproductive success is maximized by acquiring and defending the highest-$Q$ territory that can accommodate multiple nesting females. This favors defense of resource-rich territories over other strategies (e.g., display arenas without resources).\n\nStep 5: Polygyny threshold logic. Let the fitness difference in moving from a lower-quality territory to a higher-quality territory be $\\Delta F=F(Q_{\\text{high}})-F(Q_{\\text{low}})$. Let the cost to a female of sharing a male (e.g., reduced male attention) be $C$. If $\\Delta F>C$, a female gains higher $F$ by nesting in the high-$Q$ territory even if it is already occupied by another female. Given substantial $Q$ variation and female assessment, this inequality is likely to be met, leading multiple females to choose the same defended high-quality resource.\n\nStep 6: Predicted mating system. The combination of (i) defendable, heterogeneous resources, (ii) female fitness determined by resource quality, and (iii) female sampling and settlement on high-$Q$ sites, predicts resource-defense polygyny: males defend high-quality territories that attract and contain multiple nesting females.\n\nStep 7: Exclude alternatives.\n- A (Monogamy): More likely when resources are uniformly distributed or when biparental care is essential and cannot be shared; here, female fitness depends on $Q$ and high-$Q$ patches can attract multiple females.\n- C (Polyandry): Typically evolves when male-only care limits female reproductive rate or when females compete for males that provide care; not supported by resource-driven female fitness.\n- D (Lek polygyny): Arises when males cannot defend resources or provide parental care and females choose based on displays; contradicted by strong territory-quality effects on female fitness and defendable territories.\n- E (Serial monogamy): Describes partner turnover across seasons but does not capitalize on spatial heterogeneity in $Q$ within a season; it does not explain aggregation of multiple females on a single high-$Q$ territory.\n\nConclusion: The conditions match resource-defense polygyny.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1755552"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary strategies are dynamic, governed by a delicate balance of costs and benefits that can shift with changing ecological conditions. This final practice moves beyond qualitative reasoning to a quantitative analysis, asking you to model the trade-offs between polyandry and monogamy. By calculating the precise threshold at which biparental care becomes more advantageous than laying multiple clutches for different mates, you will develop skills in using mathematical models to predict evolutionary tipping points in animal behavior [@problem_id:1755531].", "problem": "A species of shorebird, the Spotted Sandpiper (*Actitis macularius*), often exhibits a polyandrous mating system. In this system, a female may mate with multiple males during a single breeding season. A particularly successful female can lay a maximum of $N_{max} = 4$ clutches of eggs per season. After laying a clutch for one male, she leaves the eggs in his care (uniparental care) and attempts to find a new mate. The probability that she successfully finds a new, available male for each subsequent clutch is a constant, $p_m = 0.75$. The probability of a clutch surviving to fledge at least one chick under uniparental care is denoted by $S_u$.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical ecological shift that makes an alternative strategy, monogamy, possible. In a monogamous pairing, a female and a male bond for the season. They collaborate to raise a single clutch of eggs. This biparental care is more effective, raising the clutch survival probability to $S_b$.\n\nFrom an evolutionary fitness perspective, natural selection will favor the mating strategy that maximizes the female's expected number of surviving clutches per season.
