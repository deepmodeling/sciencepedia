Animals must balance the benefits gained from a resource, like food or nesting sites, against the costs of acquiring and defending it. This practice introduces the powerful concept of cost-benefit analysis, a cornerstone of behavioral ecology, by asking you to model the net fitness of a territorial bird. By applying basic calculus to a biological scenario [@problem_id:1774779], you will determine the optimal territory size that maximizes an animal's reproductive success.", "problem": "In an ecological study of the fictional Crimson-crested Warbler (*Sylvia coccinnus*), biologists model the net fitness of a male bird as a function of the size of its territory. Fitness, in this context, is a measure of reproductive success. The total benefit gained from a territory of area $A$ is related to the amount of food and nesting sites it contains. This benefit, $B(A)$, is found to follow a saturation model:\n$$B(A) = \\frac{B_{\\text{max}} A}{K_{A} + A}$$\nwhere $B_{\\text{max}} = 120.0$ fitness units is the maximum possible benefit from an infinitely large territory, and $K_{A} = 2.00$ hectares is the half-saturation constant, representing the territory area at which the benefit is half of the maximum.\n\nThe total cost of maintaining the territory, $C(A)$, is primarily due to the energy expended in patrols and disputes with neighbors. This cost is modeled as being directly proportional to the area of the territory:\n$$C(A) = c A$$\nwhere the cost coefficient is $c = 5.00$ fitness units per hectare.\n\nThe net fitness, $F(A)$, of the warbler is the difference between the total benefit and the total cost.

Sun-petal Bees emit a specific \"rich-patch buzz\" upon returning to their nest after finding a high-yield nectar source. An eavesdropping Raider uses this signal. The average time a Raider must wait to detect one of these buzzes is 60 minutes. Once a buzz is detected, the Raider immediately attempts to follow the bee on its return flight to the patch. This follow-flight takes 10 minutes. The probability of successfully tracking the bee to the rich patch is 80%. A successful follow always leads to a rich patch, yielding 50 microliters of nectar.

The distribution of parental care between the sexes is a critical factor that shapes mating systems and the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics. This conceptual problem [@problem_id:1774811] presents a hypothetical scenario of sex-role reversal, where males provide all parental care. By applying the principles of parental investment theory and sexual selection, you will deduce the resulting mating system and ornamental traits, challenging common assumptions and deepening your understanding of the forces that drive social evolution.", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical avian species, the Glimmerwing Sandpiper (*Actitis fulgens*), which inhabits a high-altitude marshland ecosystem where suitable nesting sites are a scarce and patchily distributed resource. In this species, a female lays a clutch of eggs in a nest, but the male exclusively performs all subsequent parental care, including incubating the eggs and protecting the precocial chicks until they fledge. This parental care period is lengthy, rendering the male unavailable for any further mating attempts during that entire breeding season. Females, however, are physiologically capable of producing multiple clutches of eggs per season. Given this life history strategy, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected evolutionary consequences for the mating system and secondary sexual characteristics of the Glimmerwing Sandpiper?\n\nA. Females will be under strong selective pressure to compete for access to males. This will likely lead to the evolution of elaborate ornamental traits and aggressive behaviors in females, while males will be comparatively drab and choosy. The resulting mating system will be polyandrous.\n\nB. Males will be under intense selective pressure to compete for access to multiple females. This will favor the evolution of large body size and conspicuous ornamental plumage in males, while females will be drab and choosy. The resulting mating system will be polygynous.\n\nC. The high investment required from the male will create strong selective pressure for both sexes to form long-term pair bonds to ensure successful reproduction. This will lead to social monogamy with mutual mate choice and minimal sexual dimorphism in ornamentation.\n\nD. Both males and females will experience similar levels of competition for high-quality partners and nesting sites. This will result in both sexes evolving equally elaborate courtship displays and ornaments, leading to a system of mutual mate choice and serial monogamy.\n\nE. Males will gather in communal display areas called leks, where they perform elaborate courtship rituals. Females will visit these leks to select the most impressive male for mating, after which they will raise the young alone. This system results in extreme polygyny and pronounced male ornamentation.", "solution": "We analyze the expected direction of sexual selection and mating system using parental investment theory, potential reproductive rates, and operational sex ratio.\n\nFirst, define the relative parental investment per sex. Let $T_{\\text{care},m}$ be the duration of male-only parental care post-copulation, and $T_{\\text{care},f}$ be the duration of female parental care. By the problem statement, the male performs all care through fledging, so $T_{\\text{care},m}$ is long, and $T_{\\text{care},f} \\approx 0$ after laying. Because males are engaged in care for the entire breeding season, each male’s potential reproductive rate satisfies $PRR_{m} \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{care},m}}$, which is small. Females, being physiologically able to produce multiple clutches, have $PRR_{f} \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{cycle},f}}$, where $T_{\\text{cycle},f}$ is the time to form and lay a clutch; since females can lay multiple clutches without caring for offspring, $PRR_{f} \\gg PRR_{m}$.\n\nSecond, the operational sex ratio is defined as $OSR = \\frac{N_{m,\\text{ready}}}{N_{f,\\text{ready}}}$, where $N_{m,\\text{ready}}$ and $N_{f,\\text{ready}}$ are the numbers of sexually active, ready-to-mate males and females at a given time. Because many males are unavailable due to extended care while many females can be ready to lay again, we expect $OSR  1$ (female-biased).\n\nThird, by Bateman’s principle and the concept of the Bateman gradient, the sex whose reproductive success increases more steeply with additional matings experiences stronger sexual selection. Here, because males become unavailable after one mating due to $T_{\\text{care},m}$ being long, the male Bateman gradient becomes shallow after the first mating, while females can increase reproductive success by sequential matings with additional males to place multiple clutches, so the female Bateman gradient is steeper. Symbolically, beyond the first mating opportunity, $\\beta_{f} > \\beta_{m}$.\n\nFourth, parental investment theory predicts that the sex with lower $PRR$ (here, males) becomes the limiting resource and hence more choosy, while the sex with higher $PRR$ (here, females) competes for access to the limiting sex. Therefore, selection favors female competition, female ornaments, and female aggression, with males being choosy and relatively drab.\n\nFifth, the ecology of scarce, patchily distributed nesting sites intensifies this pattern. Males that secure a suitable nest site and then provide care represent a limiting, high-value resource. Because $N_{m,\\text{ready}}$ is low and suitable nest sites are limited, competition among females for access to available caring males at good sites is expected to be strong, reinforcing sex-role reversal.\n\nSixth, the mating system consequence of male-only prolonged care with high female $PRR$ is typically polyandry, often sequential, in which females mate with multiple males across the season, each male caring for one clutch. This pattern is well established in sex-role reversed shorebirds.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A matches the predicted sex-role reversal: females compete and evolve ornaments/aggression; males are choosy and drab; resulting mating system is polyandrous.\n- B contradicts the predicted direction of sexual selection and care; polygyny with ornate males is not expected when males are the sole caregivers and the limiting sex.\n- C is unlikely because females benefit from desertion to remate; long-term pair bonds are not favored given $PRR_{f} \\gg PRR_{m}$ and $OSR  1$.\n- D is incorrect because the OSR is female-biased, not symmetric; competition is asymmetric.\n- E describes lekking with no male care, the opposite of the scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1774811"}]}
