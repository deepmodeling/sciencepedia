The Operational Sex Ratio (OSR), a key metric in sexual selection studies, is defined as the ratio of sexually active males to sexually receptive females in a population at any given time.\n\nDuring the peak of the breeding season, the team conducts a census. They determine the total population in the pond consists of 450 adult damselflies, with 250 being males and 200 being females. However, not all individuals are involved in mating activities. The researchers observe that only males that can successfully defend a perch site along the water's edge are actively competing for mates. The number of these territory-holding, sexually active males is counted to be 180. Similarly, only females that have recently molted into their mature, gravid form are sexually receptive. The team identifies 75 such females in the population.\n\nUsing the data gathered by the ecologists, calculate the Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) for this damselfly population.

According to Robert Trivers's influential theory, the sex that invests more in offspring (from gestation to care) becomes a limiting resource, compelling the other sex to compete more intensely for mating opportunities. This exercise presents a classic thought experiment involving a species with sex-role reversal, challenging you to apply the principles of parental investment to predict which sex will evolve elaborate competitive traits [@problem_id:1774112].", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, parental investment is defined as any investment by a parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring. The operational sex ratio (OSR) is the ratio of sexually receptive males to sexually receptive females at any given time. These concepts are central to theories of sexual selection.\n\nConsider a hypothetical marine species, the Gilded Seahorse (*Hippocampus aureus*). In this species, the reproductive process is as follows: the female produces a clutch of eggs and, through an elaborate courtship dance, deposits them into a specialized brood pouch on the male's abdomen. The male then fertilizes the eggs internally and undergoes a gestation period, providing oxygen and nutrients to the developing embryos. After several weeks, the male gives birth to live, independent young. A male cannot mate again until after he has given birth. A female, however, can begin producing her next clutch of eggs shortly after mating. Consequently, the OSR is heavily skewed, with many more sexually receptive females than receptive males being available at any one time.\n\nBased on the principles of sexual selection driven by parental investment and the operational sex ratio, which of the following outcomes is the most likely evolutionary result in the Gilded Seahorse?\n\nA. Both sexes will be of similar size and dull coloration, with minimal courtship behavior.\n\nB. Males will be significantly larger and more brightly colored than females and will perform elaborate displays to attract females.\n\nC. Females will be significantly larger and more brightly colored than males and will actively compete with one another for access to males.\n\nD. Males will reject the majority of females but will not be the focus of competition, as females primarily invest in egg production.\n\nE. Both sexes will be highly ornamented and engage in mutual, simultaneous courtship displays of equal intensity.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify relative parental investment using Trivers’s definition. Parental investment is any investment that increases offspring survival at a cost to future reproduction. In the Gilded Seahorse, males receive eggs into a brood pouch, fertilize them internally, and carry them through gestation, providing oxygen and nutrients. Males cannot mate again until after giving birth. Let $T_{m}$ be the male’s recovery plus gestation interval per brood and $T_{f}$ be the female’s interclutch interval; the description implies $T_{m} \\gg T_{f}$. Therefore, males have higher per-offspring parental investment and a lower potential reproductive rate than females.\n\nStep 2: Determine the operational sex ratio (OSR) and its implications. The OSR is the ratio of sexually receptive males to receptive females at a given time. Let $N_{m}^{*}$ and $N_{f}^{*}$ be the numbers of receptive males and females at a snapshot in time. Because males are unavailable for a longer period, $N_{m}^{*} \\ll N_{f}^{*}$, so\n$$\n\\text{OSR} \\equiv \\frac{N_{m}^{*}}{N_{f}^{*}}  1,\n$$\nindicating a female-biased OSR.\n\nStep 3: Apply Bateman-Trivers principles of sexual selection. The sex with higher parental investment and lower potential reproductive rate should be choosier, while the sex with lower parental investment and higher potential reproductive rate should compete more intensely for mates and evolve ornaments and armaments. Let $\\beta_{m}$ and $\\beta_{f}$ denote the Bateman gradients (the slope of reproductive success versus number of mates) for males and females, respectively. In this system, male reproductive output is limited by pregnancy duration and brood capacity, so $\\beta_{m}$ is relatively shallow. Females can produce new clutches quickly after mating, so their reproductive success increases more strongly with access to mates, implying $\\beta_{f} > \\beta_{m}$. Combined with an $OSR  1$, sexual selection is predicted to act more strongly on females.\n\nStep 4: Predict behavioral and morphological outcomes. With males as the limiting sex (choosy sex) and females as the competing sex:\n- Females are expected to show intensified competition for access to receptive males.\n- Females are predicted to evolve larger size and brighter ornamentation to attract or secure mates.\n- Males are predicted to be more discriminating in mate choice due to their higher parental investment and time-limited availability.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate options against predictions.\n- Option A: Predicts minimal courtship and similar dull phenotypes; inconsistent with strong sexual selection on females under an $OSR  1$.\n- Option B: Predicts male-biased ornamentation and displays; contradicts the reversed-investment system.\n- Option C: Predicts female-biased ornamentation, larger female size, and active female-female competition for males; matches the predictions from parental investment and an $OSR  1$.\n- Option D: Claims males will not be the focus of competition; contradicts the limiting-sex logic given an $OSR  1$, although males may be choosy, they are indeed the focus of competition.\n- Option E: Predicts mutual equal ornamentation; typical of similar investment and an $OSR \\approx 1$, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the most likely evolutionary result is female-biased ornamentation and competition: Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1774112"}, {"introduction": "The contest for reproductive success often continues long after mating has occurred. This leads to post-copulatory sexual selection, where competition occurs between the ejaculates of different males to fertilize a female's eggs.

Subsequently, she mates with a second male, M2. During this second copulation, M2 first physically removes a proportion of M1's sperm and then transfers his own standard quantity of sperm, which is identical in volume to M1's initial transfer.\n\nField and laboratory observations have determined that the second male, M2, successfully removes 70% of the first male's sperm. Assuming that the probability of an egg being fertilized by a given male is directly proportional to the fraction of his sperm present in the female's storage organ at the time of fertilization (a principle known as a 'fair raffle'), calculate the paternity share of the second male, denoted as $P_2$.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $S$ denote the standard quantity of sperm transferred by a male in a copulation.
