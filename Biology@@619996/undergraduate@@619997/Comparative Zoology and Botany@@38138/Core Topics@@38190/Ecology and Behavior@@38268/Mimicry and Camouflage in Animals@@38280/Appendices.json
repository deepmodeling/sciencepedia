{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The evolution of mimicry often involves a harmless species deceiving predators by adopting the warning signals of a dangerous one, a strategy known as Batesian mimicry. This principle is not limited to visual cues; it can extend to other sensory modalities like sound. This exercise [@problem_id:1757214] challenges you to analyze a fascinating case of acoustic mimicry and apply evolutionary reasoning to determine its primary adaptive advantage.", "problem": "The burrowing owl (*Athene cunicularia*) is a small owl that nests and roosts in underground burrows, often those excavated by prairie dogs or badgers. In many parts of its range, its habitat overlaps with that of the prairie rattlesnake (*Crotalus viridis*), a venomous predator. A primary threat to burrowing owl eggs and nestlings is predation by mammals such as the American badger (*Taxidea taxus*), which is also a known predator of rattlesnakes but is vulnerable to their venomous bite. When a potential predator, like a badger, investigates an occupied owl burrow, the owls inside (both adults and chicks) produce a loud, raspy, protracted hissing sound. Acoustic analysis reveals that the structure and frequency of this owl hiss are remarkably similar to the defensive warning sounds produced by a cornered prairie rattlesnake.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most likely evolutionary explanation for the primary adaptive advantage of this specific vocalization in burrowing owls?\n\nA. The owl is relatively harmless to the predator, and the hiss deceives the predator into believing it is encountering a dangerous rattlesnake, causing the predator to retreat.\n\nB. The owl and the rattlesnake are both dangerous to the predator, and they have evolved a similar warning sound to more effectively teach the predator to avoid burrows.\n\nC. The hissing sound serves as an internal alarm call within the burrow, warning owl nestlings to crouch down and remain silent to avoid detection by the predator outside.\n\nD. The sound is an aggressive display used to intimidate and startle smaller competitors, such as rodents or other birds, preventing them from attempting to take over the burrow.\n\nE. The vocalization is a physiological byproduct of the owl’s state of fear and has no specific adaptive function; its resemblance to a rattlesnake's sound is purely coincidental.", "solution": "We identify the key ecological relationships described. Burrowing owls share habitat with prairie rattlesnakes, which possess a well-known defensive warning sound. A major predator of owl nests is the American badger, which preys on rattlesnakes but is also at risk from their venom and thus has a strong incentive to avoid a confrontation when detecting rattlesnake warning cues. When threatened at the burrow, owls produce a hiss acoustically similar to rattlesnake warnings. This sets the stage for deceptive signaling to deter predators.\n\nWe invoke the evolutionary principle of Batesian mimicry: a relatively harmless or less dangerous species gains a fitness advantage by mimicking the warning signals of a more dangerous species, thereby deceiving predators and reducing predation. Selection favors individuals whose signals more effectively elicit predator avoidance, because those individuals experience higher survival and reproductive success (e.g., greater survival of eggs and nestlings).\n\nWe evaluate the options against this framework.\n\nOption A states that a relatively harmless owl deceives the predator into believing it has encountered a dangerous rattlesnake, causing retreat. This matches the definition of Batesian mimicry and directly reduces predation risk at the nest, providing a primary adaptive advantage.\n\nOption B posits Müllerian mimicry, in which two dangerous species converge on a shared warning. This does not apply because owls are not venomous and are far less dangerous to a badger than rattlesnakes; thus, they are not co-teaching the predator in a mutualistic warning system.\n\nOption C proposes an internal alarm function. While alarm calls can occur in birds, the salient point here is the striking acoustic resemblance to rattlesnake warnings and the target audience being the external predator whose behavior is influenced. Thus, although an internal effect could be incidental, it does not best explain the primary adaptive advantage of the snake-like acoustic structure.\n\nOption D emphasizes deterring smaller competitors. The primary selective pressure specified is predation by mammals like badgers, not competition from smaller species, and the rattlesnake-like morphology of the sound is specifically suited to deterring rattlesnake-averse predators rather than competitors.\n\nOption E claims non-adaptive byproduct. Given the documented acoustic convergence to rattlesnake warning sounds and the clear benefit of predator deterrence, this is unlikely; selection would reinforce and refine such resemblance if it reduces predation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely evolutionary explanation for the primary adaptive advantage is deceptive signaling via Batesian mimicry, as in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1757214"}, {"introduction": "The success of a Batesian mimic is not absolute and critically depends on its abundance relative to the dangerous model species. This relationship is governed by a principle called negative frequency-dependent selection, where the mimic's protective benefit declines as it becomes more common. This practice [@problem_id:1757212] invites you to predict the ecological consequences of this dynamic, enhancing your understanding of how predator learning and population frequencies interact to define the stability of mimicry.", "problem": "In many ecosystems, Batesian mimicry provides a survival advantage to a harmless species (the mimic) that has evolved to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species (the model). The effectiveness of this strategy depends heavily on the local populations of the model, mimic, and their shared predators.\n\nConsider a stable, isolated ecosystem where a population of venomous coral snakes (*Micrurus fulvius*, the model) coexists with a population of harmless scarlet kingsnakes (*Lampropeltis elapsoides*, the mimic). The predators in this system, primarily various species of hawks and predatory mammals, are visual learners and possess no innate aversion to the red, yellow, and black banding pattern shared by both snakes. Their avoidance of this pattern is a learned behavior based on negative encounters with the venomous coral snakes. Initially, the coral snake population is substantially larger than the scarlet kingsnake population.\n\nNow, imagine a sudden environmental change leads to a massive and sustained population boom for the scarlet kingsnakes, such that their population density becomes far greater than that of the coral snakes. Based on the principles of predator learning and frequency-dependent selection, what is the most likely long-term consequence of this dramatic shift in relative abundance on the predation rates experienced by both snake species?\n\nA. The predation rate will increase for both the coral snake and the scarlet kingsnake.\n\nB. The predation rate will decrease for both the coral snake and the scarlet kingsnake.\n\nC. The predation rate will increase for the scarlet kingsnake but decrease for the coral snake.\n\nD. The predation rate will decrease for the scarlet kingsnake but increase for the coral snake.\n\nE. The predation rates for both species will remain effectively unchanged because the warning coloration is a fixed signal.", "solution": "Principle and setup: In Batesian mimicry, predator avoidance of a warning signal is a learned behavior maintained by negative reinforcement from encounters with genuinely harmful models. Let $p$ denote the frequency of the venomous model among all individuals displaying the warning pattern, i.e., $p = \\frac{N_{\\text{model}}}{N_{\\text{model}} + N_{\\text{mimic}}}$. Predators decide whether to attack a banded snake based on learned estimates of expected payoff. Let $B>0$ be the benefit from successfully attacking a harmless prey and $C>0$ the cost from attacking a venomous model (injury, illness). The expected net payoff to attacking a banded snake can be written as\n$$\nU_{\\text{attack}} = (1-p)B - pC.\n$$\nA predator will be more likely to attack when $U_{\\text{attack}}$ is larger, particularly when $U_{\\text{attack}} > 0$, which occurs when\n$$\np < \\frac{B}{B+C}.\n$$\nLearning dynamics: Predators have no innate aversion; avoidance arises when $p$ is sufficiently high that attacks are often punished (negative reinforcement), causing learned avoidance of the banded pattern. When mimics are rare, $p$ is high and many attacks result in cost $C$, so predators learn to avoid the pattern, reducing predation on both species.\n\nEffect of mimic population boom: A massive increase in mimic abundance drives $p$ downward because $N_{\\text{mimic}}$ increases while $N_{\\text{model}}$ remains comparatively small. As $p$ decreases, $U_{\\text{attack}}$ increases and can exceed zero, making attacks on banded snakes advantageous to predators. Two coupled consequences follow:\n- Predators experience many successful attacks on mimics, which positively reinforces attacking and extinguishes previously learned avoidance. This increases predation on mimics.\n- The degradation of the warning signal (lower $p$) causes predators to sample and attack more often overall, which also increases predation on the models despite their venom, because the association between the pattern and high cost weakens and exploratory attacks rise.\n\nFrequency-dependent selection: Batesian mimicry is negatively frequency-dependent; mimics gain the most protection when rare and lose it when common. As mimics become common, their protection erodes and the model’s signal reliability declines, increasing predation risk for both species.\n\nConclusion: In the long term, with mimics far more abundant than models, the learned avoidance of the banded pattern diminishes and predators attack banded snakes more frequently. Thus, predation rates increase for both the scarlet kingsnake and the coral snake.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1757212"}, {"introduction": "When a single habitat contains multiple dangerous species, some mimics evolve the remarkable ability to imitate more than one model, resulting in distinct forms, or polymorphisms, within the same population. This phenomenon is often enabled by a genetic architecture known as a \"supergene,\" which links multiple genes controlling the pattern into a single inherited block. Through a direct calculation [@problem_id:1757221], you will explore how this genetic setup creates a fitness landscape that penalizes intermediate phenotypes, providing a quantitative grasp of the disruptive selection that maintains polymorphism.", "problem": "In the study of Batesian mimicry, it is observed that some butterfly species, like the hypothetical *Heliconius disruptivus*, exhibit discrete polymorphism rather than a continuous range of patterns. These butterflies mimic two different, unpalatable model species, let's call them Model A and Model B, to avoid predation. This phenomenon is often attributed to the architecture of a \"supergene,\" a cluster of tightly linked genes that controls the entire wing pattern and is inherited as a single unit.\n\nTo model this, we represent a butterfly's complex wing pattern as a single point `P = (x, y, z)` in a 3-dimensional \"phenotype space.\" The coordinates `x`, `y`, and `z` quantify the expression levels of three distinct gene products responsible for pigment deposition, spot formation, and band structure, respectively.\n\nThe ideal phenotype for mimicking Model A is `P_A = (95.0, 30.0, 10.0)`.\nThe ideal phenotype for mimicking Model B is `P_B = (15.0, 110.0, 50.0)`.\n\nThe supergene has two main allelic configurations, `H_A` and `H_B`.\n- An individual with genotype `H_A H_A` develops the perfect `P_A` phenotype.\n- An individual with genotype `H_B H_B` develops the perfect `P_B` phenotype.\n- In a heterozygous individual (`H_A H_B`), the expression of the gene products is intermediate due to the co-dominant nature of the underlying regulatory elements. Its phenotype, `P_{AB}`, is the geometric midpoint of the two homozygous phenotypes: `P_{AB} = (\\frac{x_A+x_B}{2}, \\frac{y_A+y_B}{2}, \\frac{z_A+z_B}{2})`.\n\nThe evolutionary fitness, `W`, of a butterfly is a function of its phenotype, `P`, and is determined by predator perception. Predators learn to avoid the distinct patterns of the toxic models, so any intermediate or imperfect pattern suffers higher predation. The fitness is modeled by the function:\n$$W(P) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d_{\\text{min}}^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\nwhere `d_{min} = \\min\\left(\\|P - P_A\\|, \\|P - P_B\\|\\right)` is the minimum Euclidean distance from the individual's phenotype `P` to either of the two ideal mimic phenotypes. The parameter `\\sigma` represents the stringency of selection (i.e., the predators' perceptual tolerance for deviation), and for this population, it has a value of `\\sigma = 50.0`.\n\nGiven that the fitness of the homozygous individuals `W(P_A)` and `W(P_B)` is maximal (equal to 1.0, as their distance to their ideal phenotype is zero), calculate the relative fitness of a heterozygous individual, `W(P_{AB})`.
