By working through it, you will solidify your understanding that the branching order, or topology, is the crucial information, not the arbitrary orientation of the branches [@problem_id:2311348].", "problem": "An exo-biologist is studying the evolutionary history of five newly discovered alien species on a distant planet. Let's call them Species V, W, X, Y, and Z. Two different graduate students, using the same genetic dataset but different visualization software, produce two textual descriptions of the phylogenetic tree. Your task is to determine if their conclusions about the evolutionary relationships are the same or different.\n\n**Tree 1 Description:**\nThe tree is rooted with Species Z as the outgroup, meaning it is the most distantly related to all other species. The remaining four species form a monophyletic group which splits into two main branches. The first branch leads to Species Y. The second branch leads to a smaller group containing Species V, W, and X. Within this smaller group, Species X is the sister taxon to a clade containing Species V and Species W, which are each other's closest relatives.\n\n**Tree 2 Description:**\nThe tree is rooted with Species Z as the outgroup. The lineage leading to the other four species immediately splits into two clades. The first clade is composed of Species V, W, and X. The second clade consists solely of Species Y. Within the first clade, Species V and Species W are sister taxa, and this pair shares a more recent common ancestor with Species X than with any other species.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly evaluates the two trees?\n\nA. The trees represent different evolutionary histories because the positions of Species Y and the (V, W, X) clade are swapped.\n\nB. The trees represent different evolutionary histories because in Tree 1, Species Y appears to be more \"advanced\" than Species X, while their relationship is ambiguous in Tree 2.\n\nC. The trees represent the same evolutionary history because the pattern of sister-group relationships is identical in both.\n\nD.
