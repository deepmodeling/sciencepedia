The second gene, the Pigment locus, has a dominant allele $B$ for black fur and a recessive allele $b$ for brown fur. The albino allele $c$ is recessively epistatic to the Pigment locus; that is, an individual with genotype $cc$ will be albino regardless of its genotype at the Pigment locus ($BB$, $Bb$, or $bb$).\n\nA geneticist performs a cross between a true-breeding black mouse ($BBCC$) and a true-breeding albino mouse of genotype $bbcc$.
