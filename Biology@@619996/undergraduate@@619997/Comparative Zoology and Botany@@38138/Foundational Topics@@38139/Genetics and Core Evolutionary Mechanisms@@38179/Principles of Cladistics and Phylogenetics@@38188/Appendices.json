With the designated outgroup, the ancestral state at the root for each character is fixed as the plesiomorphic state, coded as $0$. For unordered binary characters, the minimal number of steps for a given topology can be computed using Fitch parsimony.\n\nLet $T_{A}$, $T_{B}$, and $T_{C}$ denote the three candidate topologies:\n- $T_{A}$: $(\\text{VS},(\\text{CL},(\\text{SV},\\text{CP})))$,\n- $T_{B}$: $(\\text{VS},(\\text{SV},(\\text{CL},\\text{CP})))$,\n- $T_{C}$: $(\\text{VS},(\\text{CP},(\\text{CL},\\text{SV})))$,\n\nwhere VS is the outgroup and $\\{\\text{CL},\\text{SV},\\text{CP}\\}$ is the ingroup.\n\nFor each character $k$, let $S_{k}(T)$ be the minimal number of changes on topology $T$.

With the root fixed at $0$, the minimal reconstruction is a single change $0\\to 1$ on the branch leading to the ingroup, regardless of ingroup topology.

If SV and CP are sisters, a single change $0\\to 1$ on their shared ancestral branch explains both $1$ states with no extra changes; otherwise, two independent gains are required (or a gain plus a reversal), yielding a minimal count of $2$. Therefore,\n$$\nS_{2}(T_{A})=1,\\quad S_{2}(T_{B})=2,\\quad S_{2}(T_{C})=2.\n$$\n\nCharacter $3$ (Dorsal Crest): VS $0$; CL $1$, SV $0$, CP $0$. Only CL is derived.

Based on morphological and genetic data, she constructs a phylogenetic tree, also known as a cladogram. The branching pattern, representing the hypothesized relationships, can be described using a nested parenthetical notation. In this notation, a pair of parentheses encloses a clade, which consists of an ancestor and all its descendants. Sister taxa (groups that share a more recent common ancestor with each other than with any other group) are placed together within a set of parentheses, separated by a comma.\n\nThe exobotanist's proposed cladogram for the five species—*Aethelflora singularis* (A), *Borealis petran* (B), *Coriolis undulata* (C), *Densus ramulosus* (D), and *Echinus volutus* (E)—is represented by the following structure:\n\n`((A, B), (C, (D, E)))`\n\nThis structure indicates that species A and B are sister taxa.

Rotation allows swapping the order of sister groups within any parentheses without changing the topology.\n\nEvaluate each option against the required clades:\n\nOption A: \"((A, C), (B, (D, E)))\" places A and C as sisters and B sister to \"(D, E)\". This violates the required sister pairing of A with B and is not equivalent.\n\nOption B: \"((C, (E, D)), (A, B))\" preserves the clade \"(A, B)\".
