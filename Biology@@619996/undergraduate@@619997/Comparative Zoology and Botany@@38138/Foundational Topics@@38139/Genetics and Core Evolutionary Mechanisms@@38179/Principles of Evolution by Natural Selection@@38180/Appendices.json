This exercise explores the concept of stabilizing selection, where individuals at both extremes of a trait's distribution are at a disadvantage. By analyzing the energetic challenges faced by a nectar-feeding bat, you will learn to identify the signature of stabilizing selection from ecological data and understand how it shapes populations around an optimal state. [@problem_id:1770610]", "problem": "In a high-altitude neotropical cloud forest, a species of nectar-feeding bat, *Aerobatus optimus*, relies exclusively on the nectar of the bell-shaped flower *Floris profundus*. To feed, the bat must hover in front of the flower and insert its long tongue. An ecological study reveals a strong relationship between the bat's body mass and its foraging efficiency, which is a primary determinant of its overall fitness (survival and reproductive success).\n\nThe study found the following:\n- Bats with a very low body mass, while agile, have a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, leading to significant metabolic heat loss in the cool mountain air. To compensate and generate enough lift to hover, they must maintain an extremely high wing-beat frequency, which is energetically unsustainable and leads to rapid exhaustion, limiting their ability to collect sufficient nectar.\n- Bats with a very high body mass possess greater energy reserves, but their size imposes a severe penalty on flight energetics. The power required to hover increases dramatically with mass, making it difficult for the largest bats to remain airborne long enough to drain a flower's nectar reserves. Their reduced maneuverability also makes them less efficient at moving between flowers.\n- Bats of an intermediate body mass appear to strike an optimal balance, maximizing their net energy gain per foraging trip.\n\nGiven this information, what mode of natural selection is acting on the body mass of this bat population?\n\nA. Stabilizing selection\n\nB. Directional selection\n\nC. Disruptive selection\n\nD. Sexual selection\n\nE. Frequency-dependent selection", "solution": "We identify the trait under selection as body mass and the fitness outcome as net energy gain and foraging efficiency, which directly determine survival and reproduction. The study describes that individuals with very low mass have reduced fitness due to high metabolic costs and unsustainable hovering demands, and individuals with very high mass have reduced fitness due to high power requirements for hovering and reduced maneuverability. Therefore, both extremes of the trait distribution have lower fitness, while individuals with intermediate mass maximize net energy gain and hence fitness.\n\nFormally, let $m$ denote body mass and $W(m)$ denote fitness. The description implies that $W(m)$ is maximized at an intermediate $m$ and decreases toward both lower and higher $m$, i.e., $W(m)$ has a single peak at an intermediate value. This pattern corresponds to selection against both extremes and favors the mean phenotype, which is the definition of stabilizing selection. By contrast, directional selection would favor one extreme (not supported here), disruptive selection would favor both extremes over intermediates (opposite of the observation), sexual selection involves mate choice traits rather than viability or foraging energetics per se, and frequency-dependent selection depends on trait frequencies altering fitness, which is not described.\n\nTherefore, the mode of natural selection acting on body mass in this population is stabilizing selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1770610"}, {"introduction": "A core challenge in evolutionary biology is disentangling the effects of different evolutionary mechanisms. Is a trait's high frequency in a population the result of adaptation by natural selection, or is it merely a product of random chance, known as genetic drift? This problem presents a classic scenario requiring you to think like an evolutionary biologist, evaluating different lines of evidence to distinguish the deterministic process of selection from the stochastic process of drift in a founder population. [@problem_id:1770590]", "problem": "A mainland population of a flowering plant, *Petalidium grandiflorum*, is primarily pollinated by a nocturnal moth species. This plant has two alleles for flower color: a dominant allele `W` that produces white flowers, and a recessive allele `p` that produces purple flowers. On the mainland, the white-flowered phenotype has a significant fitness advantage as the moths are strongly attracted to white petals in low light, leading to much higher rates of pollination and seed production. Consequently, the recessive `p` allele is found at a very low frequency in the vast mainland population.\n\nA small group of seeds from this mainland population is transported by a storm and colonizes a remote, isolated island that has no native *Petalidium* plants. After several generations, botanists discover this new island population and are surprised to find that the frequency of the purple-flowered `p` allele is extremely high. The botanists wish to determine whether this high frequency is a result of genetic drift (specifically, the founder effect) or a result of natural selection acting differently in the new island environment.\n\nWhich of the following subsequent observations would provide the strongest evidence that the high frequency of the `p` allele on the island is a consequence of genetic drift rather than natural selection?\n\nA. A native bee species on the island is discovered to be the primary pollinator, and it shows a strong preference for visiting purple flowers over white flowers.\n\nB. The population size on the island remains small, and over the next several decades, the frequency of the `p` allele is observed to fluctuate unpredictably, with no clear correlation to rainfall, temperature, or pollinator activity.\n\nC. Seeds and pollen from the mainland are found to be arriving on the island at a steady rate, and the frequency of the `p` allele begins to decline, approaching the low frequency seen on the mainland.\n\nD. A detailed study of reproductive success reveals that, on average, individual purple-flowered plants on the island produce significantly more viable seeds per season than white-flowered plants.\n\nE. Genetic sequencing reveals that the rate at which the `W` allele mutates into the `p` allele is an order of magnitude higher in the island's environmental conditions than on the mainland.", "solution": "Define $q$ as the frequency of the recessive purple allele $p$ in the island population. The relevant population-genetic expectations under different evolutionary forces are:\n\n- Genetic drift in a diploid population of effective size $N_{e}$ causes random changes in allele frequency with\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta q]=0,\\quad \\operatorname{Var}(\\Delta q)=\\frac{q(1-q)}{2N_{e}}$$\nper generation (Wright-Fisher model). Drift is strongest when $N_{e}$ is small and produces unpredictable, non-directional fluctuations with no necessary correlation to environmental variables or fitness differences.\n\n- Directional natural selection generates a systematic change in allele frequency. If the purple allele increases fitness by selection coefficient $s$ (for concreteness, suppose purple has higher fitness), then, ignoring dominance for illustration, the expected change is approximately\n$$\\Delta q \\approx \\frac{s\\,p\\,q}{\\bar{w}},\\quad p=1-q,$$\nwhich is directional and should correlate with measurable fitness differences (e.g., pollinator preference, seed output).\n\n- Founder effect is a special case of drift: an initial sampling event from a large source population into a small number of colonists can produce a high $q$ by chance; subsequent dynamics in a small, isolated population will continue to reflect drift unless selection or migration dominates.\n\nEvaluate each observation:\n\nA. A strong pollinator preference for purple indicates a fitness advantage to purple flowers, predicting directional selection for the $p$ allele (nonzero average $\\Delta q$ correlated with pollinator behavior), which supports selection, not drift.\n\nB. Persistently small population size and allele-frequency fluctuations that are unpredictable and uncorrelated with environmental factors or pollinator activity match the drift signature: $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta q]=0$ with variance inversely proportional to $N_{e}$, consistent with founder effect establishing a high initial $q$ and ongoing random changes.\n\nC. Steady gene flow from the mainland causing $q$ to decline toward the mainland value indicates migration overriding island dynamics. This does not distinguish drift from selection as the initial cause; migration can counter either.\n\nD. Higher average viable seed production by purple plants directly demonstrates a fitness advantage to the $p$ allele, predicting directional selection ($\\Delta q > 0$ on average), not drift.\n\nE. An elevated mutation rate from $W$ to $p$ points to mutation pressure as the cause of high $q$, not drift; this is a different mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the observation that most strongly supports genetic drift (founder effect) rather than natural selection is the small population with unpredictable, uncorrelated allele-frequency fluctuations.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1770590"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative descriptions, evolutionary biology uses quantitative tools to make testable predictions about how populations will change over time. The breeder's equation, $R = h^2 S$, is a cornerstone of this predictive framework, linking the response to selection ($R$), the heritability of a trait ($h^2$), and the strength of selection ($S$). This problem provides a hands-on opportunity to apply this fundamental equation, allowing you to calculate the expected evolutionary response in a plant population under intense pressure from herbivores.

The plant produces a class of phenolic compounds in its petals that deter feeding by the weevil. The concentration of these compounds is a quantitative trait.\n\nA team of evolutionary biologists established that the mean concentration of these defensive phenolics across the entire plant population at the beginning of the flowering season was 88.0 micrograms per gram ($\\mu g/g$) of petal tissue. The narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) of this trait in this specific population and environment was previously determined to be 0.40.\n\nDuring one particularly harsh season, an unusually large population of *Miarus campanulae* emerged, leading to intense selective pressure. The weevils preferentially consumed the petals of plants with lower phenolic concentrations. Consequently, only the plants that survived this intense herbivory were able to successfully reproduce. The mean phenolic concentration of these surviving, reproductive individuals was measured to be 103.0 $\\mu g/g$.\n\nAssuming this instance of herbivory is the only source of selection on this trait, predict the expected mean concentration of defensive phenolics in the immediate offspring generation.
