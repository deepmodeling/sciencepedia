{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "While mutation is the ultimate origin of brand-new alleles, genetic recombination is a powerful engine for shuffling existing variation into novel combinations. This first practice problem [@problem_id:1775350] explores the fascinating mechanism of intragenic recombination, where a crossover event occurs *within* the boundaries of a single gene. By analyzing a classic scenario in snapdragons, you will learn to visualize how meiosis can generate a fully functional, wild-type allele from two different non-functional parental alleles, providing a powerful source of genetic and phenotypic novelty.", "problem": "In snapdragons, petal color is controlled by a single gene, `PIGMENT-SYNTHASE` (`PDS`), which codes for a crucial enzyme in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. The wild-type allele, `PDS_wt`, produces a functional enzyme leading to red petals. Genetic screening has identified two different non-functional, recessive alleles. The first, `pds_1`, contains a nonsense mutation at a position 20% of the way into the gene's coding sequence from the 5' end. The second, `pds_2`, contains a single-nucleotide deletion causing a frameshift mutation at a position 80% of the way into the coding sequence. Plants homozygous for either `pds_1` or `pds_2` have white petals.\n\nAn experiment is conducted using a true-breeding `pds_1` plant and a true-breeding `pds_2` plant. They are crossed to produce an F1 generation. These F1 plants are all found to have white petals. The F1 plants are then self-pollinated to produce an F2 generation. While the vast majority of F2 offspring have white petals, a very small fraction, approximately 0.09%, are observed to have red petals.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most plausible molecular explanation for the appearance of red-petaled plants in the F2 generation?\n\nA. The protein products of the `pds_1` and `pds_2` alleles in the F1 parent engage in intergenic complementation, folding together to form a small number of functional enzymes that are passed to the F2 generation.\n\nB. A spontaneous back-mutation occurs in the germline of the F1 parent, reverting the `pds_1` allele to `PDS_wt` at a frequency that accounts for the observed red-petaled F2 offspring.\n\nC. A meiotic crossover event occurs within the `PDS` gene in the F1 parent, between the sites of the `pds_1` and `pds_2` mutations, generating a gamete with a `PDS_wt` allele.\n\nD. Chromosomal nondisjunction during meiosis in the F1 parent leads to some gametes being diploid for the chromosome carrying the `PDS` gene, allowing for a gene dosage effect that overcomes the mutations.\n\nE. The F1 plants exhibit a high rate of somatic recombination, and these somatic changes are heritable, allowing for the transmission of a restored `PDS_wt` allele to the F2 generation.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most plausible explanation for the appearance of a small number of wild-type (red-petaled) offspring from a parent that is heterozygous for two different mutant alleles of the same gene.\n\nLet's first establish the genetic makeup of the F1 parent. The F1 plant is a heterozygote produced from a cross between `pds_1/pds_1` and `pds_2/pds_2` parents. Therefore, the F1 genotype is `pds_1 / pds_2`. This means that on one homologous chromosome, the plant has the `pds_1` allele, and on the other homologous chromosome, it has the `pds_2` allele. The fact that the F1 plant has white petals indicates that these two mutations do not complement each other; they are alleles of the same gene (i.e., they are in the same cistron), and both produce non-functional products.\n\nWe can represent the two homologous chromosomes in the F1 parent. Let `m1` be the mutation site for `pds_1` and `m2` be the mutation site for `pds_2`. Let `+` represent the corresponding wild-type sequence at that location. Since `pds_1` has a mutation at the 20% mark and is normal elsewhere, and `pds_2` has a mutation at the 80% mark and is normal elsewhere, the arrangement on the homologous chromosomes is:\n\nChromosome 1: `---[m1]----------[+]---`\nChromosome 2: `---[+]----------[m2]---`\n\nHere, the bracketed region represents the `PDS` gene. The F1 parent produces gametes through meiosis. For a red-petaled F2 plant to appear, a gamete carrying a fully functional `PDS_wt` allele must have been produced by the F1 parent. A `PDS_wt` allele would have the structure `---[+]----------[+]---`.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Intergenic complementation is incorrect. Complementation is a phenomenon typically observed between mutations in *different* genes. Since `pds_1` and `pds_2` are alleles of the *same* gene, this is a test for *intragenic* complementation. The problem states that the F1 heterozygote (`pds_1 / pds_2`) has white petals, which is direct experimental evidence that complementation does *not* occurâ€”the two mutant protein products cannot combine to form a functional enzyme.\n\nB. A spontaneous back-mutation (reversion) is a possible source of wild-type alleles, but it is an extremely rare event. The frequency of a single point mutation reverting is typically on the order of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-8}$ per gene per generation. The problem describes a scenario where red-petaled plants appear at a frequency of 0.09%, or $9 \\times 10^{-4}$. This frequency is significantly higher than typical back-mutation rates, making it an unlikely explanation, especially when a more common meiotic mechanism exists.\n\nC. This option describes intragenic recombination. During prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes align and can exchange genetic material through crossing over. If a crossover event occurs *within* the `PDS` gene, specifically in the region between the `m1` and `m2` mutation sites, it can generate new combinations of alleles.\n\nLet's visualize the crossover:\n```\nParental Chromosomes Aligned in Prophase I:\n---[m1]----------|----------[+]---\n                 X\n---[+]----------|----------[m2]---\n```\nThe vertical bar `|` marks the crossover point between the two mutation sites. After this exchange, the resulting chromatids that will segregate into gametes are:\n1.  Parental chromatid: `---[m1]----------[+]---` (allele `pds_1`)\n2.  Parental chromatid: `---[+]----------[m2]---` (allele `pds_2`)\n3.  Recombinant chromatid (double mutant): `---[m1]----------[m2]---`\n4.  Recombinant chromatid (wild-type): `---[+]----------[+]---` (allele `PDS_wt`)\n\nThis process successfully generates a gamete containing a fully functional `PDS_wt` allele. The frequency of such an event is proportional to the distance between the mutation sites. A frequency of recombinant phenotypes of 0.09% is a plausible outcome for intragenic recombination between two sites within a single gene. This is the most consistent and plausible explanation for the observations.\n\nD. Nondisjunction is the failure of chromosomes to separate properly during meiosis. This leads to aneuploidy (e.g., trisomy or monosomy), which typically results in severe developmental defects or lethality, not the restoration of a wild-type phenotype. A gamete that is diploid for the chromosome would have genotype `pds_1 / pds_2`, and fertilization would result in a trisomic individual that would still lack a `PDS_wt` allele and likely be white-petaled, if viable at all.\n\nE. Somatic mutations/recombination occur in the body cells of an organism, not the germline (cells that produce gametes). While somatic recombination could potentially create a patch of red tissue on a white-petaled F1 plant, these changes are not heritable in animals and are not the standard mechanism for passing traits to offspring in plants. The question asks for the origin of red-petaled F2 *plants*, which requires the formation of a functional gamete in the F1 parent's germline. Therefore, a somatic event is not the correct explanation for a heritable trait.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only mechanism that correctly and plausibly explains the generation of a `PDS_wt` allele at the observed frequency is intragenic recombination via meiotic crossing over.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1775350"}, {"introduction": "Mutations are the raw material for evolution, but their introduction into a population is not always a uniform process.
