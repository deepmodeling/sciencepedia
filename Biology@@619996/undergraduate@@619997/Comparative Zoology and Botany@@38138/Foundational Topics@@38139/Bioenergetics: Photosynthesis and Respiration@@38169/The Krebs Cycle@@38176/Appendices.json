This organism is being studied for its potential in bioremediation due to its ability to completely oxidize organic acetyl groups. The primary pathway for this oxidation is the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle, commonly known as the Krebs cycle. This cycle begins when a two-carbon acetyl group, delivered by acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), condenses with a four-carbon molecule of oxaloacetate. In the subsequent series of enzymatic reactions, the acetyl group is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide, and high-energy electrons are captured by the primary electron carriers, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide ($NAD^+$) and Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD).\n\nAssuming the TCA cycle in *Acidovorax syntheticus* operates identically to the canonical pathway found in textbooks, determine the total number of electrons harvested by both $NAD^+$ and FAD combined during one complete turn of the cycle, starting from the entry of a single acetyl-CoA molecule.\n\n", "solution": "The canonical tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle oxidizes the two-carbon acetyl group from one acetyl-CoA completely to carbon dioxide while reducing the electron carriers $\\mathrm{NAD^{+}}$ and $\\mathrm{FAD}$.

This pyruvate is isotopically labeled with Carbon-14 ($^{14}$C) exclusively at its carboxyl carbon atom. The labeled pyruvate is then transported into the mitochondrial matrix where it is converted to acetyl-CoA, which subsequently enters the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle).\n\nAssuming the cycle proceeds for one full turn, which of the following statements correctly describes the fate of the $^{14}$C label with respect to the carbon dioxide ($CO_{2}$) molecules produced?\n\nA. The first molecule of $CO_{2}$ released *during the Krebs cycle* is radioactive.\nB. The labeled carbon atom is released as $CO_{2}$ *before* the Krebs cycle begins.\nC. The second molecule of $CO_{2}$ released *during the Krebs cycle* is radioactive, but the first is not.\nD. Both molecules of $CO_{2}$ released *during the Krebs cycle* are radioactive.\nE.
