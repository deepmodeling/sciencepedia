Mastering this type of energy accounting is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of metabolic pathways and understanding how cells harvest chemical energy.", "problem": "In an experimental study on cellular metabolism, a researcher prepares an in-vitro system containing all the necessary enzymes, cofactors, and substrates for the glycolytic pathway to function. A single molecule of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is introduced into this system. The pathway is allowed to proceed to completion, resulting in the full conversion of the initial substrate into pyruvate.\n\nCalculate the gross number of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecules generated through substrate-level phosphorylation during this specific process, starting from one molecule of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and ending with pyruvate.", "solution": "We consider glycolysis beginning with fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The aldolase reaction splits one molecule of FBP into two triose phosphates: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP). Triose phosphate isomerase rapidly interconverts DHAP and GAP, so the carbon flux proceeds as two molecules of GAP.\n\nEach GAP proceeds through the following sequence:\n1) GAP is converted to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, using inorganic phosphate and reducing NAD^{+} to NADH. This step does not involve ATP formation or consumption.\n2) 1,3-BPG donates a high-energy phosphate to ADP via phosphoglycerate kinase:\n$$\\text{1,3-BPG} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow \\text{3-phosphoglycerate} + \\text{ATP}.$$\nThis yields one ATP per GAP.\n3) Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), formed downstream from 3-phosphoglycerate via phosphoglycerate mutase and enolase, donates its phosphate to ADP via pyruvate kinase:\n$$\\text{PEP} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow \\text{pyruvate} + \\text{ATP}.$$\nThis yields one additional ATP per GAP.\n\nTherefore, per molecule of GAP, substrate-level phosphorylation generates\n$$1\\ \\text{ATP (phosphoglycerate kinase)} + 1\\ \\text{ATP (pyruvate kinase)} = 2\\ \\text{ATP}.$$\nSince one molecule of FBP yields two molecules of GAP, the gross ATP produced is\n$$2 \\times 2 = 4.$$\n\nBecause the problem starts at FBP, there is no ATP investment to subtract from earlier steps (hexokinase and phosphofructokinase), and the requested quantity is explicitly the gross ATP generated via substrate-level phosphorylation.

This exercise explores the toxic effects of arsenate, a chemical analog of phosphate, on the glycolytic pathway [@problem_id:1735485]. By analyzing how arsenate \"uncouples\" a key energy-conserving reaction, you will gain a clearer appreciation for the elegant chemical logic behind substrate-level phosphorylation.", "problem": "A toxicologist is investigating the metabolic impact of arsenate ($\\text{AsO}_4^{3-}$) on mammalian cells. It is known that arsenate is a chemical analogue of inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) and can interfere with glycolysis. Specifically, during the payoff phase of glycolysis, the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) normally catalyzes the oxidation and phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. In the presence of arsenate, the enzyme mistakenly uses arsenate instead of phosphate, producing 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate. This arsenate-containing product is highly unstable in the aqueous environment of the cytosol and immediately and spontaneously hydrolyzes to 3-phosphoglycerate and free arsenate, without the action of any enzyme.\n\nConsider a single molecule of glucose being metabolized by a cell under conditions where arsenate is present in sufficient concentration to fully substitute for inorganic phosphate in the GAPDH-catalyzed reaction. Assuming the rest of the glycolytic pathway proceeds without inhibition, calculate the net yield of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecules generated from this single glucose molecule through glycolysis.", "solution": "Glycolysis of one glucose involves an investment phase and a payoff phase. In the investment phase, two ATP are consumed: one at hexokinase converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and one at phosphofructokinase-1 converting fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Thus the ATP cost is $2$.\n\nIn the normal payoff phase (without arsenate), two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate are converted to two molecules of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase using inorganic phosphate, and then phosphoglycerate kinase generates ATP from each 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, yielding $2$ ATP total at this step per glucose. Subsequently, pyruvate kinase generates one ATP per phosphoenolpyruvate, giving $2$ more ATP per glucose. Hence, normally $4$ ATP are produced and the net is $2$.\n\nWith arsenate present at sufficient concentration to fully substitute for inorganic phosphate at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step, the enzyme forms 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate instead of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This arsenate ester spontaneously hydrolyzes to 3-phosphoglycerate and free arsenate without passing through the phosphoglycerate kinase reaction, so the substrate-level phosphorylation that would generate ATP at phosphoglycerate kinase does not occur. Carbon flux continues from 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate kinase still generates $2$ ATP per glucose (one per triose).\n\nTherefore, in the arsenate condition:\n- ATP produced in the payoff phase comes only from pyruvate kinase: $2$.\n- ATP consumed in the investment phase remains $2$.\n\nThe net ATP yield is\n$$\n\\text{ATP}_{\\text{net}}=2-2=0.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1735485"}, {"introduction": "The flow of metabolites through glycolysis is not constant; it is exquisitely regulated to meet the cell's energetic demands. This final practice delves into the heart of glycolytic control by examining phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), a key allosteric enzyme [@problem_id:1735464].
