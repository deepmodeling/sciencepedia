By translating a textual description of evolutionary history into a mental map of relationships, you will practice the foundational logic used by biologists to navigate the tree of life.", "problem": "In modern biology, the evolutionary relationships between different groups of organisms are visualized using phylogenetic trees or cladograms. The branching patterns of these diagrams represent a hypothesis about the sequence of divergence events from common ancestors. The principle of cladistics states that two taxa are considered more closely related to each other than to a third taxon if they share a more recent common ancestor.\n\nConsider the following simplified textual description of the phylogeny of a subset of vertebrate animals:\n\nThe group known as bony vertebrates (Osteichthyes) is divided into two major lineages. The first lineage is the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), a group that includes the modern Salmon. The second lineage is the lobe-finned fishes (Sarcopterygii). The sarcopterygian lineage itself gave rise to the tetrapods, or four-limbed vertebrates. The earliest tetrapods eventually diverged into two principal groups: the amphibians and the amniotes. The amniotes, characterized by eggs adapted for life on land, subsequently split into two major clades. One clade, the synapsids, includes all mammals. The other clade, the sauropsids, further diversified. Within the sauropsids, a key divergence separated the lepidosaurs, which include the modern Lizard, from the archosaurs. This archosaur group is the ancestral lineage that includes both crocodilians and birds, such as the modern Sparrow.\n\nBased solely on this textual description of evolutionary relationships, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The lizard is more closely related to the salmon than to the sparrow.\n\nB. The lizard is more closely related to the sparrow than to the salmon.\n\nC. The lizard is equally related to the salmon and the sparrow.\n\nD. The relationship cannot be determined from the information provided.", "solution": "We apply the cladistic principle: among three taxa, the pair that shares a more recent common ancestor is more closely related.\n\nFrom the description, the sequence of splits is:\n- Osteichthyes divides into Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes, including Salmon) and Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes).\n- Sarcopterygii gives rise to Tetrapods.\n- Tetrapods split into Amphibians and Amniotes.\n- Amniotes split into Synapsids (mammals) and Sauropsids.\n- Sauropsids split into Lepidosaurs (including Lizard) and Archosaurs (including birds such as Sparrow).\n\nLet $L$ denote Lizard (a lepidosaur within Sauropsida), $Sp$ denote Sparrow (an archosaur within Sauropsida), and $Sa$ denote Salmon (an actinopterygian).\n\n- The most recent common ancestor $\\operatorname{MRCA}(L,Sp)$ lies within Sauropsida, i.e., after the Amniote split and specifically at the Sauropsid node preceding the Lepidosaur–Archosaur divergence.\n- The most recent common ancestor $\\operatorname{MRCA}(L,Sa)$ lies at the base of Osteichthyes, at the split between Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii, because $L$ descends from Sarcopterygii via Tetrapods and $Sa$ is Actinopterygii.\n\nSince the Sauropsid node is a descendant of the Osteichthyan node along the lizard’s lineage, we have that $\\operatorname{MRCA}(L,Sp)$ is more recent than $\\operatorname{MRCA}(L,Sa)$. By the cladistic criterion, $L$ is more closely related to $Sp$ than to $Sa$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the lizard is more closely related to the sparrow than to the salmon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1769766"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand how to read a phylogenetic tree, the next question is how biologists construct them, especially when faced with conflicting possibilities. This exercise [@problem_id:1769709] introduces the powerful principle of maximum parsimony, which applies Occam's razor to evolution by favoring the simplest explanation—the one requiring the fewest evolutionary changes. By working with a hypothetical scenario, you can focus purely on the logical method of tallying character changes on competing trees to determine the most parsimonious hypothesis, a core skill in phylogenetic inference.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the relationships among three newly discovered species of extraterrestrial vertebrates: *Aquasaurus fluitans* (Species A), *Arboraptor saltans* (Species B), and *Xerocolossus lapis* (Species C).

We count the minimum number of state changes (Fitch parsimony) required on each hypothesized rooted topology with the outgroup attached at the root.\n\nTaxon states:\n- Outgroup (ancestral state at root): Skin = Smooth; Diet = Herbivore; Limbs = 4; Bioluminescence = Absent.\n- A: Smooth, Carnivore, 6, Present.\n- B: Scaly, Carnivore, 4, Absent.\n- C: Plated, Herbivore, 4, Absent.\n\nDefine the two ingroup topologies:\n- Hypothesis 1 (H1): $(A,(B,C))$.\n- Hypothesis 2 (H2): $(C,(A,B))$.\n\nCharacter-by-character parsimony counts under each hypothesis:\n\n1) Skin texture (Smooth/Scaly/Plated), root = Smooth.\n- H1 $(A,(B,C))$: Assign the ingroup root as Smooth to match A without change. In clade $(B,C)$ the tips are Scaly and Plated, so each terminal requires a change from their ancestor to its tip. Minimum changes: $2$.\n- H2 $(C,(A,B))$: With root = Smooth, place one change to Plated on the branch to C and one change to Scaly on the branch to B (keeping A Smooth). Minimum changes: $2$.\nThus, Skin costs $2$ for both H1 and H2.\n\n2) Primary diet (Herbivore/Carnivore/Omnivore), present states: Herbivore and Carnivore only, root = Herbivore.\n- H1 $(A,(B,C))$: Let the ingroup root be Herbivore. Then A (Carnivore) requires $1$ change on its branch. In $(B,C)$, choose the internal state Herbivore (to match root); B (Carnivore) requires $1$ change; C (Herbivore) requires $0$. Total: $2$ changes.\n- H2 $(C,(A,B))$: With root = Herbivore, set the internal state of $(A,B)$ to Carnivore via a single change on the branch leading to the $(A,B)$ clade; then A and B require $0$ changes each; C (Herbivore) requires $0$. Total: $1$ change.\nThus, Diet costs $2$ for H1 and $1$ for H2.\n\n3) Limb number (4 or 6), root = $4$.\n- H1 $(A,(B,C))$: Set ingroup root $=4$; A $=6$ requires $1$ change on A’s branch; $(B,C)$ both $=4$ so $0$ additional changes.

This thought experiment [@problem_id:1769715] explores a classic case: the evolution of endothermy (\"warm-bloodedness\") in birds and mammals. You will analyze why a parsimony analysis, under certain conditions, might mistakenly treat this trait as evidence for a close relationship, revealing the crucial distinction between traits shared due to common ancestry (synapomorphy) versus those that evolved independently (homoplasy).", "problem": "A student of comparative biology is investigating the evolution of thermoregulation using the principle of maximum parsimony. The principle of maximum parsimony states that the phylogenetic tree and a corresponding hypothesis of character evolution that require the fewest evolutionary changes are to be preferred. The student considers three vertebrate groups: Mammals, Birds, and Lizards. It is known that Mammals and Birds are endothermic (\"warm-blooded\"), while Lizards are ectothermic (\"cold-blooded\").\n\nThe student performs a phylogenetic analysis focused on the relationship between Birds and Mammals, selecting the Lizard as the outgroup. The use of an outgroup helps to root the tree and determine the polarity of character state changes (i.e., which state is ancestral). In this analysis, the resulting tree topology is (Lizard, (Bird, Mammal)).\n\nBased on this specific analysis (using the Lizard as the outgroup for the Bird-Mammal pair), the student concludes that endothermy is a synapomorphy—a shared derived character—that defines a monophyletic clade of Birds and Mammals. This conclusion is, in fact, an artifact of the analysis, as modern biology considers endothermy in birds and mammals to be a case of convergent evolution (homoplasy).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct reasoning for why the student's maximum parsimony analysis incorrectly inferred endothermy as a synapomorphy?\n\nA. With an ectothermic outgroup (Lizard), postulating a single evolutionary gain of endothermy on the branch leading to the common ancestor of Birds and Mammals requires only one evolutionary step, whereas postulating two independent gains requires two steps. Parsimony favors the one-step hypothesis.\n\nB. The Lizard, being ectothermic, represents the ancestral state. Therefore, any deviation from this state, like endothermy, must have occurred only once in the most recent common ancestor of all endothermic groups in the analysis.\n\nC. Parsimony analysis would show that a reversal from endothermy to ectothermy in the lizard lineage is more costly than a single gain of endothermy in the Bird-Mammal ancestor, thus favoring the synapomorphy model.\n\nD. The principle of maximum parsimony inherently favors grouping organisms by shared traits, and since both Birds and Mammals are endothermic, they are automatically grouped together, making the character a synapomorphy by definition.\n\nE. With an ectothermic outgroup, the most parsimonious explanation is that endothermy evolved independently in Birds and Mammals (two steps), but the student misinterpreted the result as indicating a single step.", "solution": "Encode the binary thermoregulation character as follows: ectothermy is state $0$ and endothermy is state $1$. The fixed rooted topology is $(\\text{Lizard},(\\text{Bird},\\text{Mammal}))$ with the outgroup Lizard in state $0$ and the ingroup leaves Bird and Mammal both in state $1$.\n\nUnder maximum parsimony (e.g., Fitch parsimony), we assign state sets to internal nodes to minimize the total number of state changes. Let $v$ be the most recent common ancestor of Bird and Mammal, and let $r$ be the root where Lizard joins the ingroup. At $v$, the child states are $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{1\\}$, so the intersection is $\\{1\\}$, implying $v$ is assigned $\\{1\\}$ without forcing any change on the branches to Bird or Mammal. At $r$, the child state sets are $\\{0\\}$ (Lizard) and $\\{1\\}$ (node $v$), whose intersection is empty, so we take the union $\\{0,1\\}$ and count exactly one change on one of the two branches leading to these children. Biologically, this corresponds to a single gain of endothermy ($0 \\to 1$) on the branch leading to the common ancestor of Birds and Mammals. The minimum number of steps is therefore $1$.\n\nConsider the alternative of two independent gains: to realize this on the same topology and polarity, the ancestor of Bird and Mammal would have to be $0$, followed by two separate changes $0 \\to 1$ on the Bird and Mammal branches. This requires $2$ steps, which is less parsimonious than $1$ step.\n\nThus, with an ectothermic outgroup and both ingroup taxa endothermic on the topology $(\\text{Lizard},(\\text{Bird},\\text{Mammal}))$, maximum parsimony prefers the single gain on the shared ancestor over two independent gains, thereby (incorrectly, given external knowledge) inferring endothermy as a synapomorphy for Birds and Mammals. This is precisely the reasoning described in option A. Options B, C, D, and E misstate how parsimony evaluates changes or what it inherently favors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1769715"}]}
