They hypothesize that the evolution of the femoral bone's structure was primarily constrained by the mechanical stress it could endure during locomotion.\n\nThe compressive stress, $\\sigma$, on a bone is defined as the force applied per unit cross-sectional area. The material comprising the femurs of this animal lineage is known to have a maximum tolerable compressive stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}$. The central hypothesis is that, through natural selection, the femur of any animal in this lineage is built such that the peak stress experienced during its most strenuous, typical movement is approximately equal to this constant value, $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nThe peak force, $F_{\\text{peak}}$, on a single femur is not simply one-quarter of the animal's weight. Dynamic effects from running and jumping amplify this force. The paleontologists' model proposes that this peak force is given by $F_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{1}{4} M g \\cdot f(M)$, where $M$ is the total body mass of the animal, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $f(M)$ is a dimensionless dynamic load factor that depends on the animal's mass.\n\nFurther analysis suggests that larger animals in this lineage evolved to move more cautiously to mitigate the risk of bone fracture from high-impact forces. This behavioral and physiological adaptation is captured by a dynamic load factor that scales with mass according to the relation $f(M) = \\beta M^{-1/6}$, where $\\beta$ is a dimensionless proportionality constant.\n\nAssuming this model is correct and that the peak stress $\\sigma$ is constant across all species of varying mass within this lineage, determine the value of the scaling exponent $k$ in the allometric equation $A = cM^k$, which relates the femur's cross-sectional area, $A$, to the animal's body mass, $M$.

This problem quantitatively compares the power requirements for two distinct strategies: prey luring in the aphotic zone and counter-illumination camouflage in the mesopelagic zone.\n\n**Model 1: The Luring Anglerfish**\nA deep-sea anglerfish uses a single bioluminescent lure (esca) to attract prey in the dark. For the lure to be effective, its light must be detectable by a prey animal from a characteristic distance. Assume the esca acts as a perfect isotropic point source. The minimum irradiance (power per unit area) that a typical prey organism can detect is denoted by $I_{min}$. The prey's characteristic detection distance from the lure is $r_{prey}$. The water is not perfectly transparent and absorbs and scatters light, a phenomenon described by the diffuse attenuation coefficient, $k$.\n\n**Model 2: The Camouflaged Hatchetfish**\nA mesopelagic hatchetfish employs counter-illumination to hide from predators looking up from below. It uses an array of ventral photophores to produce light that matches the faint, downwelling sunlight filtering through the water column. For perfect camouflage at a depth $z$, the total luminous power emitted by the fish's ventral surface must produce an irradiance equal to the ambient downwelling irradiance, $I_{ambient}(z)$. The relationship between ambient irradiance and depth is given by $I_{ambient}(z) = I_{surf} \\exp(-kz)$, where $I_{surf}$ is the irradiance at the ocean surface.

The general solution $\\vec{E}$ can be decomposed into a component in the row space of $\\mathbf{M}$ and a component in the null space of $\\mathbf{M}$. The minimal norm solution is the one that lies entirely in the row space of $\\mathbf{M}$. Alternatively, we can find the general solution and then minimize its norm.\n\n**Step 1: Find the null space of M.**\nWe solve $\\mathbf{M}\\vec{E} = \\vec{0}$.
