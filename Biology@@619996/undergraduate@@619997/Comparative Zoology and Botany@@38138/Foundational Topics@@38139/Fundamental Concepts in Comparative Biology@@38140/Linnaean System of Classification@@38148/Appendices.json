Just as grammar brings clarity to language, a set of universal rules governs how scientific names are written, ensuring that any scientist, anywhere in the world, can unambiguously identify a specific organism. This first exercise focuses on these essential \"grammatical\" rules of capitalization and formatting, which are the first step toward mastering the language of taxonomy [@problem_id:1753818].", "problem": "In the Linnaean system of binomial nomenclature, every recognized species is assigned a two-part scientific name. A first-year biology student is writing a report on the giant sequoia and needs to correctly write its scientific name, which consists of the genus \"Sequoiadendron\" and the specific epithet \"giganteum\". Below are several attempts the student has made, each with a corresponding justification for the formatting used. Identify the *only* option that presents both the correctly formatted scientific name and the correct justification based on standard taxonomic conventions.\n\nA. *Sequoiadendron Giganteum*. The genus is capitalized, the specific epithet is capitalized because it is a significant descriptor, and the entire name is italicized.\n\nB. *Sequoiadendron giganteum*. The genus is capitalized, the specific epithet is always written in lowercase, and the entire name is italicized.\n\nC. Sequoiadendron giganteum. The genus is capitalized and the specific epithet is lowercase. Italicization is optional and used only for emphasis.\n\nD. _Sequoiadendron giganteum_. The genus is capitalized and the specific epithet is lowercase. The name must be underlined, as this is the standard for all scientific publications.\n\nE. *sequoiadendron giganteum*. Both the genus and specific epithet are written in lowercase to distinguish them from common names, and the entire name is italicized.", "solution": "First, recall the standard conventions of binomial nomenclature as governed by the relevant codes (e.g., ICN for algae, fungi, and plants; ICZN for animals), which are consistent on basic formatting:\n- The scientific name of a species is a binomial: genus name followed by specific epithet.\n- The genus name is capitalized; the specific epithet is written in lowercase.\n- The entire binomial is italicized when typeset. When italics are unavailable (e.g., handwriting or typewriter), each part is underlined separately; underlining is not required when italics are available.\n\nEvaluate each option against these rules:\nA. Capitalizes the specific epithet and claims capitalization is justified by significance. This is incorrect: the specific epithet is not capitalized, even if descriptive or derived from a proper noun; it remains lowercase.\nB. Capitalizes the genus, uses lowercase for the specific epithet, and italicizes the entire binomial with correct justification. This matches the standard conventions and is correct.\nC. Claims italicization is optional and only for emphasis. This is incorrect; italicization is required in formal scientific writing when italics are available.\nD. Uses underlining and claims it is the standard for all scientific publications. This is incorrect; underlining is only a substitute when italics are unavailable, not a universal requirement.\nE. Puts the genus in lowercase. This violates the rule that the genus name is capitalized.\n\nTherefore, only option B presents both the correctly formatted scientific name and the correct justification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1753818"}, {"introduction": "With millions of species named over more than 250 years, it is inevitable that some names have been unintentionally reused. To prevent the chaos of having two different types of animals sharing the same genus name, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature enforces the Principle of Homonymy. This practice presents a realistic scenario where a newly discovered fossil is given a name already in use, forcing us to apply the rules of priority to determine which name is valid and what must be done to resolve the conflict [@problem_id:1753843].", "problem": "A paleontologist, Dr. Anya Sharma, discovers the fossilized remains of a previously unknown Eocene mammal. After careful study, she publishes a formal description, establishing a new genus which she names *Pinguinus*, in reference to its somewhat penguin-like robust forelimbs adapted for digging. However, she is unaware that the genus name *Pinguinus* was already validly established by Bonnaterre in 1791 for a genus of bird (the now-extinct Great Auk). Both the fossil mammal and the bird are classified within the kingdom Animalia.\n\nAccording to the rules set forth by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), what is the correct nomenclatural status and outcome for a) Dr. Sharma's new fossil mammal genus and b) the existing bird genus?\n\nA. The fossil mammal genus name is a junior homonym and must be replaced with a new name. The bird genus name *Pinguinus* is unaffected.\n\nB. Both names are considered valid because one refers to a bird (Class Aves) and the other to a mammal (Class Mammalia), and the ICZN only considers homonymy within the same taxonomic Class.\n\nC. The case must be referred to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, which will decide which genus is more scientifically significant and therefore gets to keep the name *Pinguinus*.\n\nD. The fossil mammal's name is automatically amended by the ICZN to *Neopinguinus* to resolve the conflict, while the bird genus name *Pinguinus* is conserved.\n\nE. The bird genus name *Pinguinus* (1791) becomes a *nomen oblitum* (a \"forgotten name\") because it refers to an extinct species, and Dr. Sharma's new fossil genus *Pinguinus* becomes the valid name as the *nomen protectum* (a \"protected name\").", "solution": "We apply the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) rules on homonymy and priority.\n\n1) Principle of Homonymy (ICZN Art. 52): Two names that are spelled identically and refer to different taxa within the animal kingdom are homonyms. This principle is not restricted by taxonomic rank beyond the relevant name-group nor by class; it applies across all animals. Therefore, a mammal genus name and a bird genus name that are identical are homonyms.\n\n2) Genus-group homonymy (ICZN Art. 53): Identical genus-group names established for different taxa are homonyms; the later name is the junior homonym and is invalid.\n\n3) Priority and status (ICZN Art. 23 and Art. 52.3): The older name has priority and is the senior homonym; the later one is the junior homonym and is invalid for use as a valid name.\n\n4) Consequence for the junior homonym (ICZN Art. 60.1): A junior homonym must be replaced by an available and valid substitute name (a nomen novum or by adopting the oldest available synonym if applicable). There is no automatic amendment by the ICZN; a new name must be proposed by an author.\n\nApplying these rules:\n- The bird genus name Pinguinus Bonnaterre, 1791 is the senior homonym and remains valid and unaffected.\n- Dr. Sharma’s new mammal genus name Pinguinus, being later, is a junior homonym and cannot be used as a valid name; it must be replaced with a new, available name.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n- A is correct: the mammal genus is a junior homonym that must be replaced; the bird genus is unaffected.\n- B is incorrect because homonymy is not restricted to the same Class; it applies across Animalia.\n- C is incorrect because the Commission does not choose based on scientific significance; default rules of priority apply unless a formal case justifying the use of plenary power is submitted and accepted.\n- D is incorrect because there is no automatic ICZN amendment to Neopinguinus; replacement names are proposed by authors, not automatically assigned.\n- E is incorrect because extinction does not render a name a nomen oblitum; nomen oblitum status requires specific conditions under ICZN Art. 23.9, which are not met here, and Pinguinus (1791) is well established in the literature.\n\nTherefore, the correct outcome is described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1753843"}, {"introduction": "The work of a taxonomist often resembles that of a detective, piecing together clues from centuries of scientific literature to determine a species' single valid name. Nomenclatural histories can be tangled webs of forgotten publications, synonyms, homonyms, and formal legalistic rulings from the Commission. This advanced case study challenges you to navigate one such complex history, applying multiple principles of the Code—including priority, homonymy, and conserved names—to uncover the correct binomial for a species after a modern taxonomic revision [@problem_id:1753853].", "problem": "A taxonomist is undertaking a revision of a group of Asian longhorn beetles and must determine the correct scientific name for a species with a convoluted nomenclatural history. The historical records present the following timeline of events:\n\n1.  **1795**: In an obscure German journal, naturalist Klaus von Richter describes a new beetle species from Sumatra, naming it *Carabus splendidus*. This is the first published name for the organism.\n2.  **1830**: Unaware of Richter's publication, the influential French entomologist Jean-Luc Dubois describes what he believes to be a new species from Java. Taxonomically, it is the same species as Richter's. Dubois places it in his newly established genus *Stenochroma* and names it *Stenochroma elegans*. This name gains wide acceptance and is used in most collections and publications for the next century.\n3.  **1890**: A subsequent review reveals that the genus name *Stenochroma* Dubois, 1830 is a junior homonym of *Stenochroma* Gyllenhal, 1817, a pre-existing name for a genus of weevils. To resolve this, a replacement genus name, *Callichroma*, is proposed for Dubois's genus. The species then becomes known to some specialists as *Callichroma elegans*.\n4.  **1950**: To preserve stability due to over a century of widespread use, an appeal is made to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (the Commission). The Commission issues a binding ruling that conserves the genus name *Stenochroma* Dubois, 1830 (making it a *nomen conservandum*), and suppresses the senior homonym *Stenochroma* Gyllenhal, 1817.\n5.  **2022**: A comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis of the beetle family is published. The results demonstrate that the genus *Stenochroma* is polyphyletic. The species described by Richter and Dubois is shown to belong to a distinct clade that corresponds to the genus *Eucolorus*, which was first proposed as a subgenus in 1845 and is available to be used as a valid genus.\n\nGiven this history and adhering to the formal principles of zoological nomenclature, what is the single correct binomial name (Genus and specific epithet) for this species following the 2022 study?", "solution": "We proceed chronologically, applying the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) at each step and then combine the outcomes to determine the correct post-2022 binomen.\n\n1) Establish the oldest available species-group name and its priority. In 1795, Richter established the species as Carabus splendidus. This constitutes the first available species-group name for the taxon. In 1830, Dubois named the same species Stenochroma elegans. Under the Principle of Priority (ICZN Art. 23), the older available specific epithet has precedence. Therefore, at the species level, splendidus (Richter, 1795) is the senior synonym and takes priority over elegans (Dubois, 1830), unless the senior name is formally suppressed or a valid reversal of precedence under ICZN Art. 23.9 is demonstrated. The record provided contains no ruling or evidence that the senior epithet was suppressed or that Art. 23.9 was invoked for the species name; thus, splendidus remains the correct specific epithet.\n\n2) Address the genus-group homonymy and its resolution. In 1890, Stenochroma Dubois, 1830 was found to be a junior homonym of Stenochroma Gyllenhal, 1817, and Callichroma was proposed as a replacement. In 1950, the Commission conserved Stenochroma Dubois, 1830 and suppressed the senior homonym, stabilizing Stenochroma as an available and conserved genus name (nomen conservandum). This ruling affects only the availability of the genus-group name Stenochroma and does not alter species-level priority between splendidus and elegans.\n\n3) Apply the 2022 phylogenetic reclassification. The 2022 analysis demonstrates that the species in question belongs to a clade corresponding to the genus Eucolorus, an available genus-group name originally proposed as a subgenus in 1845 and eligible for use at full genus rank. The ICZN does not govern taxonomic circumscription, so if the species is transferred to Eucolorus on taxonomic grounds, the correct combination must reflect that genus. The Commission’s conservation of Stenochroma does not prevent recognizing Eucolorus as a distinct valid genus for a segregate clade.\n\n4) Form the correct new combination and ensure grammatical agreement. On transfer to Eucolorus, the oldest available specific epithet for the species is splendidus (Richter, 1795). Under ICZN Art. 31.2, adjectival species-group names must agree in gender with the generic name. Eucolorus (ending in -us) is masculine; the adjective splendidus is already masculine nominative singular, so no change in ending is required. Therefore, the correct binomen after the 2022 reclassification is *Eucolorus splendidus*. (Author citation is not requested, but would be in parentheses given the change of genus.)\n\nConclusion: Applying the Principle of Priority for the species epithet, acknowledging the conserved status of Stenochroma but the taxonomic reassignment to Eucolorus, and enforcing gender agreement of the adjectival epithet, the correct post-2022 binomial name is *Eucolorus splendidus*.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\textit{Eucolorus splendidus}}$$", "id": "1753853"}]}
