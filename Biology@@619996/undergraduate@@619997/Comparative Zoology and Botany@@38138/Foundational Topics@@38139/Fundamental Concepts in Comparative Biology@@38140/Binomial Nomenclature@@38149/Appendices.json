The student lists the organisms in the materials section as follows:\n- `drosophila melanogaster`\n- `Zea Mays`\n- `e. coli`\n\nAccording to the rules of binomial nomenclature and standard scientific writing conventions, several formatting errors are present in this list. Below is a list of potential formatting rules. Your task is to identify which of these rules were violated in the student's list. Select all options that correspond to a violated rule.\n\nA. The genus name, or its abbreviation, must always be capitalized.\n\nB. The specific epithet must always be in lowercase.\n\nC. The genus name is always written out in full and never abbreviated.\n\nD. The entire scientific name (both genus and specific epithet, or genus abbreviation and specific epithet) must be italicized or underlined.\n\nE.

When a species is moved to a new genus, its specific epithet, if it is an adjective, must be adjusted to agree grammatically with the gender of the new genus name. In this exercise [@problem_id:1733325], you will apply this rule of grammatical agreement, gaining insight into the linguistic structure of scientific names and the dynamic process of taxonomic revision.", "problem": "A botanist is performing a taxonomic revision based on new phylogenetic evidence. This requires moving three plant species to new genera. According to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), a specific epithet that is an adjective must be grammatically adjusted to agree in gender with the new genus name. However, a specific epithet that is a noun in the genitive case does not change its ending.\n\nYou are given the following reclassification scenarios:\n\n1.  **Species 1:** *Prunus nigra* is to be reclassified. The genus *Prunus* is feminine. The specific epithet *nigra* is the feminine form of the first/second-declension adjective meaning \"black\" (*niger*, *nigra*, *nigrum*). The species will be moved to the feminine genus *Padus*.\n\n2.  **Species 2:** *Cornus canadensis* is to be reclassified. The genus *Cornus* is feminine. The specific epithet *canadensis* is a third-declension adjective where the masculine/feminine nominative singular form is *canadensis* and the neuter nominative singular is *canadense*. The species will be moved to the neuter genus *Chamaepericlymenum*.\n\n3.  **Species 3:** *Salix hookeriana* is to be reclassified. The genus *Salix* is feminine. The specific epithet *hookeriana* is an adjective formed from the name of the botanist Hooker. For this problem, consider it a standard first/second-declension adjective. The species will be moved to the masculine genus *Pinus*.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following proposed new names are grammatically correct?\n\nA. *Padus nigra*\n\nB. *Chamaepericlymenum canadensis*\n\nC. *Pinus hookerianus*\n\nD. *Padus niger*\n\nE. *Chamaepericlymenum canadense*\n\nF. *Pinus hookeriana*", "solution": "Apply the ICN grammatical agreement rule: if the specific epithet is an adjective, it must agree in gender with the new generic name; if it is a noun in the genitive, it remains unchanged. In all three scenarios, the epithets are adjectives, so they must change (or be confirmed) to match the gender of the new genus.\n\nSpecies 1: The epithet is the first/second-declension adjective meaning \"black\" with forms niger (masculine), nigra (feminine), nigrum (neuter). The new genus Padus is feminine, so the correct epithet form is the feminine nigra. Among the options, Padus nigra (A) agrees in gender and is correct, while Padus niger (D) is masculine and therefore incorrect.\n\nSpecies 2: The epithet canadensis is a third-declension adjective whose masculine/feminine nominative singular is canadensis and neuter nominative singular is canadense. The new genus Chamaepericlymenum is neuter, so the epithet must be neuter canadense. Among the options, Chamaepericlymenum canadense (E) is correct, while Chamaepericlymenum canadensis (B) is the masculine/feminine form and is therefore incorrect.\n\nSpecies 3: The epithet hookeriana is treated as a first/second-declension adjective derived from a personal name, with forms hookerianus (masculine), hookeriana (feminine), hookerianum (neuter). The new genus *Pinus* is masculine, so the epithet must be the masculine *hookerianus*. Among the options, *Pinus hookerianus* (C) is correct, while *Pinus hookeriana* (F) is feminine and therefore incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the grammatically correct new combinations are A, C, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "1733325"}, {"introduction": "The stability of scientific names rests on the Principle of Priority, which dictates that the first validly published name for a taxon is the correct one. However, the digital age has introduced new, specific criteria for what constitutes a \"valid publication,\" particularly for works distributed electronically. This final practice [@problem_id:1733296] presents a realistic scenario of competing publications, challenging you to determine which name has priority by correctly applying the modern rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN).", "problem": "Two independent teams of entomologists discover and describe what is later determined to be the same new species of ground beetle. The \"digital team\" and the \"print team\" publish their findings unaware of each other's work.\n\nThe digital team publishes their description of the species, which they name *Aptus digitalis*, in an online-only, peer-reviewed, open-access journal. The article is posted online and becomes publicly accessible on October 1, 2018. However, at the time of this initial online posting, the authors had not yet registered the new name with the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature (ZooBank), and the publication consequently lacked a ZooBank registration identifier. The authors complete the ZooBank registration for the name *Aptus digitalis* on November 15, 2018.\n\nThe print team publishes their description of the species, naming it *Aptus impressus*, in a long-established, peer-reviewed print journal. According to the journal's colophon and distribution records, the printed volume containing the description was mailed to subscribers and made available for purchase on October 20, 2018. This publication fully complies with all traditional standards for a valid nomenclatural act.\n\nA subsequent coleopterist, upon reviewing the literature, recognizes that *Aptus digitalis* and *Aptus impressus* refer to the same biological species. According to the Principle of Priority as governed by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), which of the following statements correctly identifies the valid name for this species?\n\nA. *Aptus digitalis*, because its online publication date of October 1, 2018, predates the publication of *Aptus impressus*.\n\nB. *Aptus impressus*, because the electronic publication of *Aptus digitalis* only became nomenclaturally available on November 15, 2018, after its ZooBank registration.\n\nC. *Aptus digitalis*, because electronic publication is officially preferred and always has priority over print publication in cases of dispute, as per a 2012 ICZN amendment.\n\nD. Neither name has priority. The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature must issue a ruling to resolve the conflict since the publications are from different media.\n\nE. The \"Principle of the First Reviser\" applies, allowing the next author who addresses the synonymy to choose which name has precedence based on its appropriateness.", "solution": "By the ICZN Principle of Priority (Article 23), the valid name for a species is the oldest available name. Therefore, we must determine the dates on which each name became available under the Code.\n\nFor the print publication, availability follows the traditional standard: a printed work is published when it is issued and distributed (Articles 8.1 and 21.2). The print team’s work was mailed and made available on October 20, 2018, and it fully complies with the Code; therefore, the name Aptus impressus became available on October 20, 2018.\n\nFor the electronic-only publication, the 2012 ICZN Amendment (Article 8.5) specifies that a work issued electronically is only considered published (and its names available) if, among other requirements, it is registered in ZooBank and the work itself contains evidence of that registration (Article 8.5.3). Because the digital team’s article posted on October 1, 2018 lacked ZooBank registration at that time, it did not make the name Aptus digitalis available on October 1. The authors completed the ZooBank registration on November 15, 2018; only from the date when the electronic publication met the registration requirements could the name be considered available. Thus, Aptus digitalis became available on November 15, 2018.\n\nComparing the availability dates, Aptus impressus (October 20, 2018) predates Aptus digitalis (November 15, 2018). By Article 23, Aptus impressus has priority.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because the October 1 electronic posting did not meet Article 8.5 requirements and did not establish availability on that date.\n- Option B is correct: the electronic name only became available on November 15, 2018, which postdates the print name’s availability on October 20, 2018.\n- Option C is incorrect; the 2012 amendment does not prefer electronic over print publication; it only permits electronic publication under specified conditions.\n- Option D is incorrect; no Commission ruling is needed because the dates are not simultaneous and the Code resolves the case by priority.\n- Option E is incorrect; the First Reviser applies only to simultaneously published names, which is not the case here.\n\nHence, the valid name is Aptus impressus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1733296"}]}
