The procedure involves a two-step enzymatic treatment in an osmotically balanced buffer solution. In Step 1, the tissue cube is incubated with Enzyme 1. The resulting material is then collected and, in Step 2, incubated with Enzyme 2. The two enzymes available are pectinase, which degrades pectin, and cellulase, which degrades cellulose. Assuming the procedure is successful, which of the following statements correctly describes the macroscopic and microscopic observations at the end of each step?\n\nA. Step 1: The tissue cube remains structurally intact. Step 2: The tissue cube rapidly dissociates into a suspension of free-floating, spherical protoplasts.\n\nB.

The key structural features are:\n- Adjacent plant cells in a tissue are held together primarily by the middle lamella, which is rich in pectins.\n- Each cell is surrounded by a primary cell wall whose main load-bearing component is cellulose microfibrils.\n\nThe key enzymatic activities are:\n- Pectinase hydrolyzes pectic polysaccharides, disrupting the pectin-rich middle lamella and thereby separating cells from one another without removing individual cell walls.\n- Cellulase hydrolyzes cellulose, degrading the primary cell wall and thereby releasing the plasma membrane-bound protoplasts. Protoplasts adopt a spherical morphology due to surface tension when the rigid wall is removed, provided the buffer is osmotically balanced to prevent lysis.\n\nReasoning step by step:\n1. To dissociate a solid tissue into a suspension of individual cells, the adhesion between cells must be removed. This is achieved by degrading the middle lamella with pectinase. Therefore, after Step 1 with pectinase, the macroscopic observation is that the tissue cube breaks apart and disperses; the microscopic observation is a suspension of individual, walled plant cells, because the cellulose-rich walls remain intact.\n2. To convert individual walled cells into protoplasts, the cellulose-based cell wall must be digested by cellulase. Therefore, after Step 2 with cellulase, the microscopic observation is the appearance of free-floating, spherical protoplasts; macroscopically, the suspension consists of small, refractile spheres. The osmotically balanced buffer prevents lysis in Step 2, maintaining protoplast integrity.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A implies cellulase first leaving the cube intact, then pectinase releasing protoplasts. However, the middle lamella binds cell walls, not protoplasts, and cellulase acting first would not yield protoplasts while the pectin-bound wall network remains; moreover, protoplast formation requires wall removal around individual cells, which is impeded in an intact cube.\n- Option B matches the standard, effective sequence: Step 1 pectinase causes dissociation into individual walled cells; Step 2 cellulase digests the walls to yield spherical protoplasts.\n- Option C describes uncontrolled dissolution into debris and free protoplasts, which is inconsistent with a controlled, osmotically balanced, two-step enzymatic protocol.\n- Option D states that protoplasts appear in Step 1 and then lyse in Step 2; lysis is unlikely in an osmotically balanced buffer, and protoplast formation before removing intercellular pectin is not expected.\n- Option E ends with walled cells rather than protoplasts, contradicting the stated goal and expected outcome.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that Step 1 produces a suspension of individual, walled plant cells (after pectinase), and Step 2 releases spherical protoplasts (after cellulase), which corresponds to Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1781557"}, {"introduction": "Beyond basic structure, the plant cell wall is an engineering marvel, especially in tissues like xylem that must withstand extreme physical forces. This exercise [@problem_id:1781579] invites you to apply a biomechanical model to quantify the importance of lignin, a key polymer that reinforces secondary cell walls.
