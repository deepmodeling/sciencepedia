This drug is known to be a highly specific inhibitor of the peptidyl transferase center of 70S ribosomes, effectively halting protein synthesis by these ribosomes. The drug can freely pass through the plasma membrane and the double membranes of organelles, but it cannot cross the nuclear envelope. Consider an *in vitro* experiment where two separate cultures of healthy, metabolically active cells are treated with a sufficient concentration of Ribostatin-70: one culture contains typical mammalian somatic cells (animal cells) and the other contains photosynthetic leaf mesophyll cells (plant cells).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary, differential effects of Ribostatin-70 on these two cell types?\n\nA. Neither cell type will be affected, as both are eukaryotic and primarily utilize 80S ribosomes for protein synthesis.\n\nB. Protein synthesis in the cytoplasm will be halted in both cell types, but the plant cell will be more resilient due to its ability to photosynthesize.\n\nC. Only the plant cell will be affected, leading to a shutdown of photosynthesis due to the inhibition of chloroplast function.\n\nD. In the animal cell, mitochondrial protein synthesis will be inhibited. In the plant cell, protein synthesis within both mitochondria and chloroplasts will be inhibited.\n\nE. The animal cell's energy production will be halted, while the plant cell will be unaffected as it can rely entirely on photosynthesis, a process localized in the cytoplasm.", "solution": "The drug Ribostatin-70 is specified to be a highly specific inhibitor of the peptidyl transferase center of 70S ribosomes. The peptidyl transferase center resides in the large rRNA of the ribosome and catalyzes peptide bond formation during translation. Therefore, inhibiting it will block protein synthesis only in ribosomes of the 70S type.\n\nIn eukaryotic cells:\n1) Cytosolic ribosomes are 80S, not 70S. Thus, cytoplasmic protein synthesis will not be directly inhibited by a 70S-specific drug.\n2) Mitochondria contain bacterial-type 70S ribosomes. Therefore, mitochondrial protein synthesis will be inhibited.\n3) In plant cells, chloroplasts also contain 70S ribosomes. Therefore, chloroplast protein synthesis will be inhibited in addition to mitochondrial protein synthesis.\n\nMembrane permeability considerations given in the problem:\n- The drug can cross the plasma membrane and the double membranes of organelles, so it will reach mitochondria and, in plant cells, chloroplasts. Hence, it can access mitochondrial and chloroplast ribosomes.\n- The drug cannot cross the nuclear envelope, but this does not affect the conclusion because translation does not occur in the nucleus. The nuclear restriction does not protect mitochondria or chloroplasts.\n\nConsequences by cell type:\n- Animal (mammalian somatic) cell: Only mitochondria possess 70S ribosomes. Thus, mitochondrial translation will be inhibited, impairing synthesis of mitochondrially encoded components of the oxidative phosphorylation system.\n- Plant (photosynthetic mesophyll) cell: Both mitochondria and chloroplasts possess 70S ribosomes. Thus, translation will be inhibited in both organelles, impairing mitochondrial function and chloroplast function (including photosynthetic complexes with chloroplast-encoded subunits).\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Incorrect. Although cytosolic ribosomes are 80S, organelles have 70S ribosomes that will be inhibited.\n- B: Incorrect. Cytoplasmic translation will not be halted by a 70S-specific inhibitor, and plant resilience via photosynthesis is undermined because chloroplast translation is inhibited.\n- C: Incorrect. The animal cell is also affected via mitochondrial 70S ribosomes; additionally, in plants the effect is not limited to photosynthesis alone since mitochondria are also affected.\n- D: Correct. Animal cells lose mitochondrial protein synthesis; plant cells lose both mitochondrial and chloroplast protein synthesis.\n- E: Incorrect. Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, not in the cytoplasm, and plant cells are affected at both mitochondria and chloroplasts.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that mitochondrial translation is inhibited in animal cells, and both mitochondrial and chloroplast translation are inhibited in plant cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1781078"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying the prokaryotic origins of organelles, it is essential to understand *why* this evolutionary partnership was so transformative for life on Earth. This exercise guides you through a simplified quantitative model to estimate the immense metabolic advantage conferred by harboring mitochondria [@problem_id:1781052]. By calculating the increase in total membrane surface area available for energy production, you will develop a tangible appreciation for the bioenergetic revolution that endosymbiosis ignited.", "problem": "The endosymbiotic theory proposes that mitochondria originated from free-living aerobic alphaproteobacteria that were engulfed by an ancestral anaerobic host cell. This event provided a profound metabolic advantage to the host. In this problem, we will build a simplified quantitative model to estimate the magnitude of this advantage in terms of available surface area for metabolism.\n\nConsider a hypothetical anaerobic proto-eukaryotic host cell and a species of aerobic alphaproteobacterium.

For the original host, this is its outer surface. For the final cell, the total metabolic surface area is the sum of the host's outer surface area and the surface areas of all its internal mitochondria. For this simplified model, we will assume that the relevant surface area of each mitochondrion is equal to the surface area of the original alphaproteobacterium it evolved from, neglecting the complex folding (cristae) of the actual inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nCalculate the metabolic amplification factor, which is defined as the ratio of the final total metabolic surface area of the mature eukaryotic cell to the initial metabolic surface area of the proto-eukaryotic host cell alone.

This final practice challenges you to think like an evolutionary genomicist, designing a strategy to parse the complex history written in a cell's genome [@problem_id:1781025]. Evaluating different bioinformatic approaches will reveal how modern phylogenetic analysis provides the most rigorous and conclusive evidence for the specific alphaproteobacterial ancestry of mitochondria, distinguishing it from other potential gene sources.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the genome of a newly discovered, deeply-branching phagotrophic protist, *Cryptophagus protogenos*. Initial genomic analysis has identified a set of approximately 500 nuclear genes that lack clear eukaryotic orthologs but show high sequence similarity to bacterial genes. The biologist proposes two primary hypotheses for the origin of these genes:\n\n1.  **Endosymbiotic Gene Transfer (EGT)**: These genes were transferred to the nucleus from the genome of the ancestral proto-mitochondrion, which is widely accepted to have been an Alphaproteobacterium, following the initial endosymbiotic event.\n2.  **General Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT)**: As a phagotroph, the ancestor of *C. protogenos* regularly consumed a wide variety of bacteria. These genes were acquired sporadically through HGT from these diverse ingested bacteria, which served as food sources but did not establish a stable endosymbiosis.\n\nThe goal is to design a bioinformatic pipeline that can most reliably distinguish genes that arose from the singular EGT event (Alphaproteobacterial origin) from those that arose via general HGT from other bacterial sources (e.g., Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes).\n\nGiven the following proposed strategies, which one represents the most rigorous and conclusive approach for differentiating between these two hypotheses?\n\nA. For each gene of interest, use its protein sequence to search against a comprehensive protein database (including sequences from all major domains of life) to identify a large set of homologous sequences. Construct a multiple sequence alignment from these homologs and use it to infer a detailed phylogenetic tree. Classify a gene as a strong EGT candidate if it robustly groups within the Alphaproteobacteria clade, to the exclusion of other bacterial clades.\n\nB. For each gene of interest, determine its putative function by searching for conserved protein domains. Classify a gene as an EGT candidate if its function is related to core mitochondrial processes, such as the electron transport chain, ATP synthesis, or cofactor metabolism. Classify all other genes with bacterial homology as general HGT products.\n\nC. For each gene of interest, use its protein sequence to perform a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search against a bacterial-only protein database. If the single top-scoring hit is from a species belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria, classify the gene as an EGT candidate. Otherwise, classify it as a general HGT candidate.\n\nD. For each gene of interest, determine its subcellular localization predicted from its amino acid sequence or observed via fluorescent protein tagging. Classify a gene as an EGT candidate if and only if its protein product is targeted to the mitochondrion.\n\nE. For each gene of interest, search for its presence across a wide range of sequenced eukaryotic genomes. Classify a gene as an EGT candidate only if it has a detectable ortholog in at least 95% of other mitochondriate eukaryotes, assuming a single ancient origin should lead to near-universal conservation.", "solution": "I proceed by evaluating each proposed strategy against the core requirement: reliably distinguishing nuclear genes derived from a single ancient endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) from the ancestral proto-mitochondrion (expected to trace to Alphaproteobacteria) versus sporadic horizontal gene transfers (HGT) from diverse bacteria. The most rigorous and conclusive discriminator is a gene-by-gene phylogenetic test of ancestry that places each gene within the bacterial tree with robust support and comprehensive taxon sampling.\n\n1. Principles for distinguishing EGT from general HGT:\n- EGT prediction: Nuclear genes of EGT origin should phylogenetically trace back to Alphaproteobacteria, ideally showing eukaryotic sequences nested within or sister to Alphaproteobacterial clades with strong statistical support, consistent with a single endosymbiotic source. Gene tree placement, not mere sequence similarity or function, is the evidential standard.\n- General HGT prediction: Genes acquired from non-Alphaproteobacterial donors should group within those donor bacterial clades (e.g., Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes), again with strong support and appropriate taxon sampling.\n- Required methodological rigor: Broad, representative sampling across bacteria (especially dense Alphaproteobacterial sampling), inclusion of relevant eukaryotic homologs, high-quality multiple sequence alignment of homologous domains, model adequacy (site-heterogeneous models when needed), removal or masking of non-homologous or fast-evolving regions (e.g., N-terminal targeting peptides), and robust support assessment (bootstrap or posterior probabilities). Gene tree–species tree discordance must be interpreted in light of HGT and LBA; contamination must be excluded.\n\n2. Assessment of each strategy:\n- Option A (comprehensive phylogenetic inference on homolog sets): This directly reconstructs gene ancestry. With proper database breadth, alignment, model selection, and support testing, it is the standard and most conclusive approach to distinguish Alphaproteobacterial EGT from other bacterial HGT. It operationalizes the key discriminator: robust monophyly or sisterhood within Alphaproteobacteria to the exclusion of other bacterial clades.\n- Option B (function-based classification): Function is not diagnostic of ancestry. Many EGT-derived genes do not encode core mitochondrial functions, and genes with mitochondrial functions can be recruited from non-Alphaproteobacterial sources. Convergent functional recruitment and replacement further undermine specificity. This approach is neither sufficient nor necessary.\n- Option C (top BLAST hit to bacterial-only database): Top-hit similarity is not a phylogenetic test and is sensitive to database composition, rate variation, and stochastic similarity. It can misidentify donors and cannot distinguish deep ancestry versus recent HGT; thus, it is not rigorous or conclusive.\n- Option D (mitochondrial localization): Subcellular localization reflects current cellular routing, not historical origin. EGT-derived proteins may no longer target mitochondria, and HGT-derived proteins can be retargeted to mitochondria. Localization is neither necessary nor sufficient for EGT inference.\n- Option E (broad conservation across eukaryotes): EGT-derived genes exhibit lineage-specific retention and loss, duplication, neofunctionalization, and replacement; near-universal presence is not expected and absence of detection is uninformative due to divergence. This criterion is overly stringent and not diagnostic of Alphaproteobacterial ancestry.\n\n3. Conclusion:\nOnly Option A implements the phylogenetic, ancestry-informative test with the necessary breadth and rigor to reliably distinguish EGT from general HGT. While further best practices (e.g., testing alternative topologies, accounting for compositional bias, trimming non-homologous regions, using site-heterogeneous models, and verifying against contamination) strengthen the pipeline, among the proposed strategies, Option A is the most rigorous and conclusive.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1781025"}]}
