This process involves reading the mRNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides, called codons, and translating each codon into a specific amino acid according to the genetic code.\n\nThe provided mRNA sequence is `5'-AUGCAUACCUACGGGUAG-3'`.\n\nStep 1: Identify the start codon.\nTranslation begins at the start codon, which is almost universally AUG. This codon also codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met). We scan the mRNA from the 5' end to find the first AUG. The sequence begins with AUG, so translation will start from the very first nucleotide.\n\nStep 2: Establish the reading frame.\nOnce the start codon is identified, the mRNA is read in non-overlapping groups of three nucleotides. This is called the reading frame.\nThe sequence is grouped into codons as follows:\n`AUG CAU ACC UAC GGG UAG`\n\nStep 3: Translate each codon sequentially using the provided genetic code table.\nWe translate each codon one by one until a stop codon is reached.\n\n*   First codon: `AUG`\n    Looking at the table, `AUG` codes for Methionine (Met).\n    Polypeptide so far: Met\n\n*   Second codon: `CAU`\n    Looking at the table, `CAU` codes for Histidine (His).\n    Polypeptide so far: Met-His\n\n*   Third codon: `ACC`\n    Looking at the table, `ACC` codes for Threonine (Thr).\n    Polypeptide so far: Met-His-Thr\n\n*   Fourth codon: `UAC`\n    Looking at the table, `UAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr).\n    Polypeptide so far: Met-His-Thr-Tyr\n\n*   Fifth codon: `GGG`\n    Looking at the table, `GGG` codes for Glycine (Gly).\n    Polypeptide so far: Met-His-Thr-Tyr-Gly\n\n*   Sixth codon: `UAG`\n    Looking at the table, `UAG` is a STOP codon. Stop codons signal the termination of translation. The ribosome detaches from the mRNA, and the completed polypeptide is released. The stop codon itself does not code for an amino acid.\n\nStep 4: Determine the final polypeptide sequence.\nThe final polypeptide chain consists of the amino acids translated before the stop codon. Therefore, the sequence is Met-His-Thr-Tyr-Gly.\n\nStep 5: Compare the resulting sequence with the given options.\nA. Met-His-Thr-Tyr-Gly - This matches our derived sequence.\nB. His-Thr-Tyr-Gly - This is incorrect as it omits the initial Methionine from the start codon.\nC. Cys-Ile-Pro-Thr-Gly - This would result from an incorrect reading frame, shifted by one nucleotide to the right (starting from the 'U' of AUG: `UGC AU...`).\nD. Met-His-Thr-Tyr-Gly-STOP - This is incorrect because \"STOP\" is a signal to terminate synthesis, not an amino acid to be incorporated into the polypeptide chain.\nE. Met-Cys-Ile-Pro-Thr - This is incorrect and results from a combination of reading frame errors and misinterpretation.\n\nThe correct amino acid sequence is Met-His-Thr-Tyr-Gly, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1749536"}, {"introduction": "In eukaryotic cells, the journey from gene to protein involves an important \"editing\" step known as RNA splicing.

We will solve this in two parts.\n\n**Part 1: Determining the Original Polypeptide Sequence**\n\nFirst, we must derive the Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) sequence from the given DNA non-template (coding) strand. The DNA coding strand has the same sequence and polarity as the mRNA transcript, with the exception that thymine (T) in DNA is replaced by uracil (U) in RNA.\n\nGiven DNA coding strand: `5'-ATG GCA TAC CTG AAG TAG-3'`\n\nBy replacing each T with a U, we obtain the mRNA sequence:\n`5'-AUG GCA UAC CUG AAG UAG-3'`\n\nNext, we translate this mRNA sequence into a polypeptide. Translation starts at the initiation codon (start codon) and proceeds by reading codons (groups of three nucleotides) until a termination codon (stop codon) is reached.\n\nUsing the provided genetic code table:\n- The first codon, AUG, codes for Methionine (Met) and also serves as the start codon.\n- The second codon, GCA, codes for Alanine (Ala).\n- The third codon, UAC, codes for Tyrosine (Tyr).\n- The fourth codon, CUG, codes for Leucine (Leu).\n- The fifth codon, AAG, codes for Lysine (Lys).\n- The sixth codon, UAG, is a stop codon. This signals the termination of translation.\n\nTherefore, the original polypeptide sequence is Met-Ala-Tyr-Leu-Lys.\n\n**Part 2: Determining the Mutated Polypeptide Sequence**\n\nA mutation occurs that deletes the guanine (G) at the 4th position from the $5'$ end of the DNA coding strand.\n\nOriginal DNA coding strand: `5'-A T G G C A T A C C T G A A G T A G-3'`\nThe nucleotide at the 4th position is G. After its deletion, the strand becomes:\n`5'-A T G C A T A C C T G A A G T A G-3'`\n\nThis deletion causes a frameshift mutation, meaning the three-nucleotide reading frame is altered from the point of the mutation onwards. We must regroup the new sequence into codons:\n\nNew DNA coding strand: `5'-ATG CAT ACC TGA AGT AG...-3'`\n\nNow, we transcribe this new DNA coding strand into its corresponding mRNA sequence by replacing T with U:\nNew mRNA sequence: `5'-AUG CAU ACC UGA AGU AG...-3'`\n\nNext, we translate this a new mRNA sequence:\n- The first codon, AUG, codes for Methionine (Met).\n- The second codon, CAU, codes for Histidine (His).\n- The third codon, ACC, codes for Threonine (Thr).\n- The fourth codon, UGA, is a stop codon. This leads to premature termination of translation.\n\nThe resulting mutated polypeptide is significantly shorter and has a different amino acid sequence after the point of mutation. The mutated polypeptide sequence is Met-His-Thr.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe original polypeptide is Met-Ala-Tyr-Leu-Lys, and the mutated polypeptide is Met-His-Thr.
