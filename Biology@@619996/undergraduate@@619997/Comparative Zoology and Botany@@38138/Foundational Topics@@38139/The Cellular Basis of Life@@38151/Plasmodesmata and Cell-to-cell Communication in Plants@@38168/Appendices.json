Consider two adjacent parenchyma cells, a \"source\" cell and a \"sink\" cell, separated by a cell wall of uniform thickness. A small, water-soluble signaling molecule is produced in the source cell and consumed in the sink cell, maintaining a constant concentration $C_1$ in the source cell's cytoplasm and a lower constant concentration $C_2$ in the sink cell's cytoplasm.\n\nAssume that transport of this molecule between the cells occurs exclusively through the plasmodesmata. Each plasmodesma can be modeled as a cylindrical channel of radius $r_p$ and length $L$ (equal to the cell wall thickness). Inside each channel is a central, impermeable cylindrical structure called a desmotubule, with radius $r_d$. The molecule diffuses only through the annular region between the channel wall and the desmotubule, known as the cytoplasmic sleeve. The plasmodesmata are distributed uniformly over the cell wall with a density of $\\rho_{pd}$ (number of plasmodesmata per unit area of the cell wall). The diffusion coefficient of the molecule within the cytoplasm of the sleeve is $D$.\n\nDerive a closed-form analytic expression for the net flux of the signaling molecule, $J_{net}$, across the cell wall. This flux should be defined as the total number of moles of the molecule passing from the source cell to the sink cell per unit time, per unit area of the cell wall.

Plants actively modify the size of these channels in response to threats, such as viral infections, by depositing a polymer called callose. In this scenario [@problem_id:1768486], you will model how this gating mechanism impacts the velocity of a pathogen's spread, linking the physical properties of plasmodesmata directly to a critical function in plant immunity.", "problem": "A plant biologist is investigating the spread of a viral pathogen through phloem tissue, which can be modeled as a one-dimensional chain of cells connected by plasmodesmata. The viral infection begins in the first cell at time $t=0$. The virus has a characteristic replication time, $T_{rep}$, which is the time it requires to replicate within a host cell to a sufficient concentration to begin infecting adjacent cells.\n\nAfter replication is complete, the virus moves to an adjacent cell through a plasmodesma. The time taken for this transit, $T_{move}$, is found to be inversely proportional to the effective cross-sectional area of the plasmodesmatal pore.\n\nThe biologist compares two types of plants: a wild-type (WT) and a mutant (MT).\n- In the **wild-type (WT)** plant, the cell's defense mechanism responds to infection by depositing callose, a polysaccharide that constricts the plasmodesmatal pore to a smaller, stable radius $r_{WT}$.\n- The **mutant (MT)** plant is deficient in the enzyme callose synthase, meaning it cannot produce callose to constrict its plasmodesmata. Consequently, the pores remain at their initial, unconstricted radius, $r_0$.\n\nFor the MT plant with its open plasmodesmata, the movement time is observed to be a fraction of the replication time, given by $T_{move, MT} = \\beta T_{rep}$. The ratio of the constricted radius in the WT plant to the open radius in the MT plant is given by the dimensionless constant $\\gamma = \\frac{r_{WT}}{r_0}$.\n\nThe velocity of the infection front, $v$, is defined as the number of new cells infected per unit time.

This final practice puts you in the role of a research scientist interpreting a forward genetic screen [@problem_id:1768449]. By analyzing this experimental setup, you will see how modern molecular tools, like fluorescent reporter proteins, are used to identify the specific genes responsible for establishing symplastic domains, which are essential for organized plant development.", "problem": "A plant biologist is investigating the process of symplastic isolation during lateral root development in the model organism *Arabidopsis thaliana*. Lateral roots initiate deep within the parent root from pericycle cells and must grow through the surrounding endodermis, cortex, and epidermis layers. During their development, the lateral root primordia (LRP) become symplastically isolated, meaning the plasmodesmata connecting them to the surrounding parent root tissues are functionally closed.\n\nTo find genes involved in this isolation process, the biologist performs a forward genetic screen. They first create a transgenic reporter line of *Arabidopsis*. This line contains a genetic construct, `ProCASP1::3xGFP`, which expresses three tandem copies of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under the control of the *CASP1* promoter. The `ProCASP1` promoter is active exclusively in the endodermis, the cell layer directly surrounding the pericycle from which the LRP develops. The resulting 3xGFP fusion protein is large and cannot diffuse through plasmodesmata with a normal size exclusion limit.\n\nSeeds from this stable transgenic line are mutagenized with Ethyl Methane Sulfonate (EMS) to induce random point mutations throughout the genome. These M1 plants are allowed to self-fertilize, and their progeny (the M2 generation) are screened for developmental defects using fluorescence microscopy. The goal is to identify mutants that are specifically defective in establishing symplastic isolation of the LRP from the surrounding endodermis.\n\nWhich of the following phenotypes, observed in an M2 seedling, would be the most direct and specific indicator of a mutation in a gene required for establishing symplastic isolation of the lateral root primordium?\n\nA. No GFP signal is observed anywhere in the root tissues.\n\nB. GFP signal is observed in the endodermal cell layer, and also appears within the cells of the developing lateral root primordium.\n\nC. GFP signal is observed in all cell types throughout the root, including the epidermis, cortex, endodermis, and the central vascular tissues.\n\nD. GFP signal is confined to the endodermal cell layer as expected, but the lateral roots fail to physically emerge from the parent root.\n\nE. GFP signal is observed in the endodermal cell layer, and a faint signal is also detected in the adjacent cortex cell layer, which lies outside the endodermis.", "solution": "We identify the experimental logic and the specific readout that would directly report a failure to establish symplastic isolation between the endodermis (the ProCASP1-expressing tissue) and the lateral root primordium (LRP).\n\n1. Reporter design and expected wild-type behavior:\n- The construct ProCASP1::3xGFP drives expression specifically in endodermal cells surrounding the pericycle/LRP.\n- The 3xGFP fusion is sufficiently large to be excluded by plasmodesmata under normal size exclusion limits and is commonly used as a symplastic tracer that does not passively move through plasmodesmata.\n- In wild type, during lateral root development, the LRP becomes symplastically isolated from surrounding tissues, including the endodermis. Therefore, GFP produced in the endodermis should remain confined to the endodermis and should not appear inside LRP cells.\n\n2. Defining the phenotype of interest:\n- A mutation that specifically disrupts the establishment of symplastic isolation between the endodermis and the LRP would result in functionally open or improperly closed plasmodesmata at this interface. The most direct and specific indicator of this failure is the appearance of endodermis-derived 3xGFP inside cells of the LRP.\n\n3. Evaluation of options:\n- Option A (no GFP anywhere): Indicates loss of reporter expression or transgene silencing; not specific to symplastic isolation.\n- Option B (GFP in endodermis and also within LRP cells): Directly indicates that GFP originating in the endodermis is able to enter the LRP, consistent with failed establishment of symplastic isolation at the endodermis–LRP interface. This is the most specific readout for the process under investigation.\n- Option C (GFP in all root cell types): Indicates misexpression of the reporter or promoter deregulation; not specific to isolation.\n- Option D (GFP confined to endodermis, but lateral roots fail to emerge): Reflects a morphogenetic/emergence defect, which can arise from numerous pathways unrelated to symplastic isolation; not specific.\n- Option E (GFP in endodermis and faint signal in adjacent cortex): Suggests altered plasmodesmal permeability between endodermis and cortex, but does not report on endodermis–LRP isolation specifically; hence not the most direct indicator of the process of interest.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n- The most direct and specific indicator of a mutation disrupting symplastic isolation of the LRP is observing endodermis-derived 3xGFP inside LRP cells.\n\nThus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1768449"}]}
