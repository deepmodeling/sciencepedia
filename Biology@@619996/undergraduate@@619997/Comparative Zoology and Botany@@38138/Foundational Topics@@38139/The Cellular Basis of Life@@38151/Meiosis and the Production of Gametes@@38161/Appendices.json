{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding meiosis begins with its most fundamental consequence: the reduction of chromosome number. The first meiotic division is specifically called a 'reductional division' because it separates homologous chromosomes, halving the chromosome set for the daughter cells. This exercise provides a clear, practical application of this principle by asking you to determine the chromosome count in a key intermediate cell during animal spermatogenesis [@problem_id:1756277].", "problem": "The somatic cells of the domestic dog, *Canis lupus familiaris*, are diploid and contain a total of 78 chromosomes. This set includes 38 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. In a male dog, the process of spermatogenesis occurs in the testes to produce sperm. This process begins with a diploid cell, a primary spermatocyte, which undergoes two successive meiotic divisions (Meiosis I and Meiosis II). The first meiotic division of a primary spermatocyte results in the formation of two secondary spermatocytes. Each of these secondary spermatocytes then proceeds to undergo the second meiotic division.\n\nConsidering this process, determine the number of chromosomes present in a single secondary spermatocyte of a male dog.\n\nA. 156\n\nB. 78\n\nC. 39\n\nD. 38\n\nE. 23", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of chromosomes in a secondary spermatocyte of a male dog, given that its somatic cells have 78 chromosomes.\n\nFirst, let's establish the ploidy level of the somatic cells. Somatic cells are diploid, meaning they contain two sets of chromosomes. The diploid number is denoted as $2n$. We are given that for a dog, $2n = 78$.\n\nThe process of spermatogenesis involves meiosis, which reduces the chromosome number by half to produce haploid gametes. The process starts with a diploid primary spermatocyte. Before meiosis begins, the cell's DNA replicates during the S phase of interphase. At this point, the primary spermatocyte still has a chromosome number of $2n=78$, but each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids.\n\nMeiosis I is the first meiotic division, and it is a reductional division. During Meiosis I, homologous chromosome pairs separate from each other and move to opposite poles of the cell. The primary spermatocyte ($2n$) divides to form two secondary spermatocytes. Because the homologous pairs have been separated, each resulting secondary spermatocyte is haploid, meaning it contains only one set of chromosomes. The chromosome number in a haploid cell is denoted as $n$.\n\nWe can calculate the haploid number ($n$) from the diploid number ($2n$):\n$$n = \\frac{2n}{2}$$\nGiven $2n = 78$, we find:\n$$n = \\frac{78}{2} = 39$$\n\nTherefore, a secondary spermatocyte contains 39 chromosomes. It is important to note that at this stage (after Meiosis I but before Meiosis II), each of these 39 chromosomes still consists of a pair of sister chromatids. The sister chromatids will separate during Meiosis II, resulting in spermatids that also have $n=39$ chromosomes, but each chromosome is now a single chromatid. However, the question specifically asks for the number of chromosomes in a secondary spermatocyte, which is the haploid number, $n$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. 156: This would be the total number of chromatids in a primary spermatocyte after DNA replication ($78 \\text{ chromosomes} \\times 2 \\text{ chromatids/chromosome} = 156 \\text{ chromatids}$). This is incorrect.\nB. 78: This is the diploid number ($2n$), which is the number of chromosomes in a somatic cell or a primary spermatocyte. It is also the number of chromatids in a secondary spermatocyte ($39 \\text{ chromosomes} \\times 2 \\text{ chromatids/chromosome} = 78 \\text{ chromatids}$). This is incorrect as the question asks for the chromosome count.\nC. 39: This is the haploid number ($n$), which is the correct number of chromosomes in a secondary spermatocyte.\nD. 38: This represents the number of autosomes in a haploid set. A gamete or secondary spermatocyte contains 38 autosomes plus one sex chromosome (either X or Y), for a total of 39 chromosomes. This option incorrectly excludes the sex chromosome.\nE. 23: This is the haploid number of chromosomes for humans ($n=23$), not for dogs.\n\nThus, the correct number of chromosomes in a dog's secondary spermatocyte is 39.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1756277"}, {"introduction": "While chromosome number is a key metric, a deeper understanding of meiosis requires tracking the total amount of DNA within the cell. The 'C-value' helps us quantify this genetic material as it is replicated and subsequently divided. This practice challenges you to trace the journey of DNA through both meiotic divisions, clarifying the crucial distinction between chromosome number and DNA content [@problem_id:1756329].", "problem": "A cytogeneticist is studying the reproductive cycle of a newly discovered flowering plant, *Solanum novum*. This plant is diploid. The amount of DNA in one of its haploid gametes (e.g., a mature pollen nucleus) is defined as having a value of C. Consequently, a diploid somatic cell from this plant in the G1 phase of the cell cycle contains a DNA content of 2C.\n\nThe cytogeneticist isolates a specific diploid reproductive cell, a microspore mother cell, which is about to undergo meiosis to produce microspores. At the beginning of prophase I, this cell has completed DNA replication and its total DNA content is 4C.\n\nWhat is the DNA content of a single cell immediately upon the completion of meiosis I (after the first cytokinesis), and what is the DNA content of a single resulting microspore immediately upon the completion of meiosis II (after the second cytokinesis), respectively?\n\nA. 4C, 2C\n\nB. 2C, 2C\n\nC. 2C, C\n\nD. C, C\n\nE. 4C, C", "solution": "The problem asks for the DNA content at two key stages of meiosis, starting from a diploid cell in prophase I with a DNA content of 4C. The value C represents the amount of DNA in a single, unreplicated haploid set of chromosomes.\n\nThe initial cell is a diploid microspore mother cell. Before meiosis, it undergoes the S phase of interphase, where its DNA is replicated.\n- A G1 diploid cell has a chromosome number of 2n and a DNA content of 2C.\n- After DNA replication (S phase), the cell enters meiosis I. The chromosome number is still considered 2n (as the centromere count has not changed), but each chromosome now consists of two identical sister chromatids. This doubles the amount of DNA.\n- Therefore, the starting state in prophase I is a cell with 2n chromosomes (each replicated) and a DNA content of 4C.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the DNA content after Meiosis I and Cytokinesis I.**\nMeiosis I is characterized by the separation of homologous chromosomes. The parent cell (2n, 4C) divides into two daughter cells. Each daughter cell receives one chromosome from each homologous pair.\n- The key event is that homologous pairs separate, but sister chromatids remain attached.\n- As a result, each of the two daughter cells is now haploid (n) in terms of chromosome number.\n- Since each chromosome in these daughter cells still consists of two sister chromatids, the DNA content of each cell is half that of the original parent cell.\n- DNA content per cell after Meiosis I = (Total DNA at start) / 2 = 4C / 2 = 2C.\n\nSo, the DNA content of a single cell immediately after the first meiotic division is 2C.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the DNA content after Meiosis II and Cytokinesis II.**\nMeiosis II is analogous to mitosis. It involves the separation of sister chromatids. Each of the two cells produced from meiosis I (each being n, 2C) undergoes this second division.\n- In each cell, the chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, and the sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles.\n- Each cell then divides, resulting in a total of four cells from the original parent cell.\n- Each of these final four cells (microspores) is haploid (n) and contains chromosomes consisting of a single chromatid.\n- The DNA content of each final cell is therefore half that of the cells entering meiosis II.\n- DNA content per cell after Meiosis II = (DNA content after Meiosis I) / 2 = 2C / 2 = C.\n\nSo, the DNA content of a single microspore after the second meiotic division is C.\n\nCombining the results, the DNA content is 2C after meiosis I and C after meiosis II. This corresponds to the ordered pair (2C, C).

This thought experiment explores a specific form of 'automixis' in lizards, where the fusion of meiotic products creates a diploid offspring. By analyzing this scenario, you will uncover how events like crossing over directly influence the genetic relationship between parent and offspring, revealing important concepts such as the loss of heterozygosity [@problem_id:1756278].", "problem": "Certain species of whiptail lizards (genus *Aspidoscelis*) reproduce through a form of parthenogenesis known as terminal fusion automixis. In this process, a diploid female produces a diploid offspring without fertilization. The process begins with standard oogenesis: a diploid primary oocyte undergoes Meiosis I to produce a haploid secondary oocyte and a haploid first polar body. The secondary oocyte then proceeds to Meiosis II, producing a large haploid ovum and a small haploid second polar body. In this specific type of parthenogenesis, the diploid state of the offspring is restored by the fusion of the ovum with the second polar body.\n\nConsider a mother lizard that is heterozygous for a specific gene locus, with alleles denoted as $A$ and $a$. Assume that crossing over occurs during Meiosis I between this gene's locus and the centromere. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the genetic relationship between the mother and the resulting offspring?\n\nA. The offspring will be genetically identical to the mother, as the fusion of the ovum and the second polar body perfectly restores the mother's diploid genome.\n\nB. The offspring will be genetically identical to the mother, but only if no crossing over had occurred during Meiosis I.\n\nC. The offspring will be a clone of the mother, but will be haploid due to the nature of meiosis.\n\nD. The offspring will not be genetically identical to the mother, because for any gene loci where crossing over did not occur, the offspring would become homozygous.\n\nE. The offspring cannot be viable, as polar bodies are programmed to degrade and cannot successfully fuse with an ovum.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the genetic relationship between a mother lizard and her offspring produced by a specific type of parthenogenesis (terminal fusion automixis), considering the effects of genetic crossing over.\n\nLet the mother lizard be diploid and heterozygous for a gene locus, with alleles denoted as $A$ and $a$.\n\nFirst, let's trace the alleles through meiosis. Before Meiosis I, the primary oocyte ($Aa$) replicates its DNA. The cell now contains one replicated chromosome carrying two $A$ alleles and its homologous partner carrying two $a$ alleles.\n\nThe problem states to consider the case where crossing over occurs between the gene's locus and the centromere. When this happens, it results in an exchange of alleles between non-sister chromatids. After Meiosis I, the secondary oocyte receives a replicated chromosome whose sister chromatids are now different from each other; one carries allele $A$ and the other carries allele $a$.\n\nNow, this secondary oocyte undergoes Meiosis II, where these non-identical sister chromatids separate.\n- The ovum will receive one chromatid (e.g., with allele $A$).\n- The second polar body will receive the other chromatid (e.g., with allele $a$).\n\nAccording to the problem, the offspring is formed by the fusion of this ovum ($A$) and the second polar body ($a$). Their fusion results in an offspring with genotype $Aa$. At this specific locus where crossing over occurred, the offspring's genotype ($Aa$) is identical to the mother's genotype ($Aa$).\n\nHowever, the question asks if the *entire offspring* is genetically identical. The mother is heterozygous at many gene loci across her genome. For the offspring to be a perfect clone, it must retain the mother's heterozygosity at *all* these loci. This would require crossing over to occur between the centromere and the gene locus for *every single heterozygous gene* the mother possesses.\n\nLet's consider what happens at a different heterozygous locus, say $Bb$, where *no crossing over* occurs between the gene and the centromere.\n- After replication, the primary oocyte contains a homologous pair with replicated chromosomes $BB$ and $bb$.\n- In Meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate. The secondary oocyte receives one (e.g., the $B$ chromosome, which is made of two $B$ chromatids), and the first polar body receives the other ($b$ chromosome, made of two $b$ chromatids).\n- In Meiosis II, the secondary oocyte divides. The sister chromatids separate. The ovum receives a chromatid with allele $B$, and the second polar body also receives a chromatid with allele $B$.\n- The fusion of this ovum ($B$) and second polar body ($B$) results in an offspring with genotype $BB$.\n\nIn this case, the offspring is homozygous ($BB$) at this locus, while the mother was heterozygous ($Bb$). This phenomenon is called \"loss of heterozygosity\".\n\nTherefore, although the offspring may be heterozygous at loci where crossing over occurred, it will be homozygous at any heterozygous loci where crossing over did not occur. Because it is statistically impossible for crossing over to occur at every single heterozygous locus throughout the genome, the resulting offspring will have a different overall genotype from its mother. The offspring will exhibit reduced heterozygosity compared to its parent. Thus, the offspring is not a genetically identical clone of the mother.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. This is incorrect. The fusion does not perfectly restore the genome, as shown by the loss of heterozygosity at loci without crossing over.\nB. This is incorrect. If no crossing over occurs, the offspring becomes homozygous ($AA$ or $aa$) at that locus, which is different from the heterozygous ($Aa$) mother.\nC. This is incorrect. The fusion of the haploid ovum and haploid polar body restores the diploid state.\nD. This is the correct statement. The offspring's genome will differ from the mother's due to the loss of heterozygosity at loci that did not experience crossing over.\nE. This is incorrect because the premise of the problem requires us to assume that fusion is a part of this specific reproductive mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1756278"}]}
