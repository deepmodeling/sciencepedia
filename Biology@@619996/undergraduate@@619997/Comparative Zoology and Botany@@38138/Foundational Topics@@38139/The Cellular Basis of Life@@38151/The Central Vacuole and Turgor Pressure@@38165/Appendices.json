An experimenter observes that spraying the petals and leaves with a fine mist of pure water does little to restore the flowers' firmness. However, when the cut stems of the same wilted flowers are placed in a vase of pure water, they regain their turgidity and stand upright again within a few hours.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and primary biophysical reason for this significant difference in outcomes?\n\nA. The water potential gradient between the sprayed water and the leaf cells is insufficient to drive absorption, whereas the gradient at the stem is much larger.\n\nB. Water absorption into plant cells is an active transport process requiring metabolic energy from ATP, and the cells in the stem are more metabolically active than the cells in the petals and leaves.\n\nC. The stomata, which are pores on the leaf surfaces, close when they come into contact with liquid water, forming a seal that prevents any water from entering the plant tissues.\n\nD. The epidermal cells of petals and leaves are covered by a waxy, hydrophobic cuticle that is largely impermeable to water, while the cut stem exposes the xylem, a specialized vascular tissue designed for efficient bulk water transport.\n\nE. The water sprayed on the petals and leaves evaporates from the surface much faster than it can be absorbed, whereas the water in the vase provides a stable, non-evaporating source.", "solution": "Turgor pressure in plant cells arises from water uptake driven by water potential differences. The total water potential is given by\n$$\n\\Psi = \\Psi_{s} + \\Psi_{p} + \\Psi_{g} + \\Psi_{m},\n$$\nwhere $\\Psi_{s}$ is the solute (osmotic) potential, $\\Psi_{p}$ is the pressure potential, $\\Psi_{g}$ is the gravitational potential, and $\\Psi_{m}$ is the matric potential. In wilted tissue, $\\Psi$ is substantially negative, so contact with pure water (with $\\Psi=0$) creates a favorable driving force for water entry.\n\nAt any interface, volumetric water flux can be expressed phenomenologically by\n$$\nJ_{v} = L_{p}\\,\\Delta \\Psi,\n$$\nwhere $L_{p}$ is the hydraulic conductivity (permeability) of the interface and $\\Delta \\Psi$ is the water potential difference across it. Even if $\\Delta \\Psi$ is large, $J_{v}$ remains negligible if $L_{p}$ is very small.\n\nWhen pure water is sprayed on petals and leaves, the external water potential is high (approximately zero), and the internal cell water potential is more negative, so $\\Delta \\Psi$ is favorable. However, the outer surfaces of petals and leaves are covered by a waxy, hydrophobic cuticle. This cuticle confers an extremely low $L_{p}$ for liquid water entry across the epidermis; stomata do not provide an efficient entry route for bulk water, and their state does not change the fundamental barrier posed by the cuticle. Therefore, despite a favorable $\\Delta \\Psi$, the product $L_{p}\\,\\Delta \\Psi$ remains very small and $J_{v}$ is negligible. Evaporation of sprayed water may occur, but the primary bottleneck is the very low $L_{p}$ of the cuticle, not an insufficient $\\Delta \\Psi$.\n\nBy contrast, placing the cut stems in pure water directly exposes the xylem at the cut surface. Xylem vessels provide a continuous, low-resistance apoplastic pathway specialized for bulk water transport, implying a high effective $L_{p}$ at the water–xylem interface and along the vascular pathway. With the cut end in pure water, the local xylem water potential is raised toward $\\Psi \\approx 0$, establishing a favorable $\\Delta \\Psi$ from the vase water into the vascular system and, subsequently, from the xylem into surrounding tissues. Thus, $J_{v} = L_{p}\\,\\Delta \\Psi$ becomes large because both $\\Delta \\Psi$ is favorable and $L_{p}$ is high. Water is then redistributed to dehydrated cells, increasing $\\Psi_{p}$ (turgor) as osmotic uptake proceeds, restoring firmness.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because the water potential gradient at the leaf surface is not the main limiting factor; the gradient is favorable but the permeability is extremely low.\n- Option B is incorrect because water movement into cells and through xylem is passive (driven by $\\Delta \\Psi$), not an ATP-requiring active transport.\n- Option C is incorrect because stomatal closure upon liquid contact is not the mechanism preventing water entry; the cuticle is the principal barrier.\n- Option E describes a secondary effect (evaporation) and does not capture the primary biophysical constraint on flux, which is the very low $L_{p}$ of the cuticle compared to the xylem pathway.\n\nThe most accurate and primary biophysical reason is that the leaf and petal surfaces are cuticle-covered and largely impermeable to liquid water, whereas the cut stem exposes xylem designed for efficient bulk water transport, yielding a high $L_{p}$ and substantial $J_{v}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1779631"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the pathways of water entry, we now turn to quantifying its effects within a cell. This exercise uses a simplified physical model—an elastic, semi-permeable bag—to represent a plant cell and its vacuole.

The model consists of a spherical, elastic bag made of a semi-permeable membrane that is permeable only to water. Initially, the spherical bag has a radius $r_0$ and is filled with a sucrose solution of an unknown initial molar concentration, $C_0$. The bag is then submerged in a large beaker of pure water at a constant absolute temperature $T$.\n\nDue to the influx of water, the bag swells and eventually reaches a stable, larger equilibrium radius, $r_f$. The elastic properties of the bag's membrane are such that it exerts an outward-pushing hydrostatic pressure, known as turgor pressure $P_T$, which is directly proportional to the fractional increase in the bag's volume. This relationship is given by the equation $P_T = K \\frac{V - V_0}{V_0}$, where $V_0$ is the initial volume, $V$ is the current volume, and $K$ is a volumetric elastic modulus for the membrane.\n\nAssume the sucrose does not dissociate in water.
