The cell elongates along a single axis, while its square cross-section perpendicular to that axis remains unchanged. Let the volume of the cell at the end of this normal growth phase be $V_{aniso}$.\n\nNow, consider a scenario where the developing cell is treated with a novel herbicide. This herbicide's sole mechanism of action is to prevent the polymerization of cortical microtubules, leading to a loss of directional guidance for cellulose microfibril deposition. As a consequence, the cell expands isotropically, maintaining its perfect cubical shape as it grows. Let the volume of the cell at the end of this isotropic growth phase (for the same amount of added surface area $\\Delta A$) be $V_{iso}$.\n\nDerive an expression for the ratio $\\frac{V_{iso}}{V_{aniso}}$ in terms of the growth factor $\\alpha$.", "solution": "Let the initial cube have side length $S_{0}$.

A structure called the preprophase band establishes a location early in mitosis and then disappears, yet the new cell plate is guided to that exact site later on. This advanced thought experiment asks you to evaluate several hypothetical mechanisms for this \"cellular memory,\" sharpening your ability to assess the biophysical feasibility of molecular models for complex biological phenomena [@problem_id:1776464].", "problem": "In plant cells, the plane of cell division is determined early in mitosis by the formation of a transient ring of microtubules and actin filaments at the cell cortex, known as the Preprophase Band (PPB). The PPB disassembles before the mitotic spindle forms, yet its position is \"remembered\" by the cell. During late anaphase and telophase, a completely new microtubule structure, the phragmoplast, expands centrifugally to form the new cell wall (cell plate). The expanding edge of this phragmoplast is precisely guided to fuse with the parental cell wall at the exact location previously occupied by the PPB, a cortical site now referred to as the Cortical Division Zone (CDZ). This phenomenon implies the existence of a \"cellular memory\" mechanism that persists at the CDZ long after the PPB has vanished.\n\nWhich of the following hypothetical molecular mechanisms provides the most plausible explanation for this stable, long-lived positional memory at the Cortical Division Zone?\n\nA. A set of membrane-bound proteins is directly recruited to the CDZ by the PPB. After the PPB disassembles, these proteins remain at the CDZ, acting as specific docking sites that capture components on the leading edge of the expanding phragmoplast.\n\nB. The PPB locally alters the fluidity of the plasma membrane by concentrating cholesterol and sphingolipids, forming a highly stable lipid raft. This raft persists throughout mitosis and acts as a physical barrier that channels the growing phragmoplast to the correct fusion site.\n\nC. The disassembly of the PPB microtubules releases a high local concentration of free tubulin monomers at the CDZ. This pool of monomers is sequestered and does not diffuse away, creating a chemical gradient that the phragmoplast's microtubules follow via treadmilling.\n\nD. The activity of the PPB triggers a localized and self-sustaining wave of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ release from endoplasmic reticulum cisternae situated just beneath the plasma membrane at the CDZ. This standing wave of high $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration persists until telophase and attracts $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$-binding proteins on the phragmoplast.\n\nE. The PPB physically presses against the nucleus before disassembling, triggering site-specific histone methylation on chromatin regions adjacent to the CDZ. This epigenetic mark leads to the expression of transmembrane attractant proteins, but only once the cell enters telophase.", "solution": "The question asks for a mechanism that can stably encode positional information at the cortex—specifically at the Cortical Division Zone (CDZ)—from preprophase through telophase, long after the Preprophase Band (PPB) has disassembled, and that can guide the expanding phragmoplast to the exact cortical site. Such a mechanism must satisfy the following constraints: it must be spatially localized at the cortex, molecularly stable over the timescale of mitosis, compatible with known dynamics of microtubules and actin, and able to interact with or recruit components of the phragmoplast.\n\nFirst, assess the plausibility of persistent cortical markers. Membrane-associated protein complexes can remain localized via anchoring to the plasma membrane and cell wall matrix, via interactions with cortical cytoskeletal remnants, and via multivalent scaffolding that reduces diffusion. Such complexes can serve as durable docking sites that guide or capture the edges of the expanding phragmoplast. This general strategy is consistent with known biology in plant division: proteins retained at the division site after PPB disassembly mark the CDZ and recruit factors that help align the phragmoplast for correct fusion.\n\nEvaluate the options against these constraints:\n\n1. Option A posits that membrane-bound proteins are recruited by the PPB to the CDZ and persist as docking sites to capture phragmoplast components. This mechanism is intrinsically cortical, can be long-lived due to anchoring and scaffolding, and mechanistically explains how the expanding phragmoplast is precisely guided to the prior PPB site. It is consistent with the general principle that stable protein complexes can encode spatial memory at membranes and with evidence that specific cortical proteins remain at the division site and interact with the phragmoplast.\n\n2. Option B proposes a highly stable lipid raft that persists through mitosis to channel the phragmoplast. Lipid rafts are generally dynamic, nanoscale, and transient microdomains rather than long-lived, macroscopic, annular structures. A raft functioning as a physical barrier does not provide a specific capture or recruitment mechanism for phragmoplast microtubules; it would not inherently encode a precise landing site around the cell circumference. The persistence and scale required here are biologically implausible.\n\n3. Option C invokes a sequestered pool of free tubulin at the cortex forming a gradient that guides microtubules via treadmilling. Free tubulin is a small, freely diffusing protein, and in the absence of binding sinks, any local concentration excess would dissipate rapidly by diffusion. Using the diffusion timescale estimate, a localized excess over a characteristic length $L$ dissipates in time $t \\sim L^2/D$, with $D$ the diffusion coefficient; for micron-scale $L$, $t$ is short relative to the duration of mitosis, so a stable gradient is not achievable without binding, which reduces the argument to stable cortical binding sites as in Option A. Moreover, phragmoplast microtubules nucleate and grow within the phragmoplast and are not guided by following a tubulin monomer gradient at the cortex.\n\n4. Option D suggests a self-sustaining standing wave of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ localized to the CDZ that persists until telophase and attracts $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$-binding proteins. Cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signals are typically transient, tightly buffered, and diffusive; maintaining a spatially fixed, long-lived standing wave at a specific cortical location throughout mitosis is not supported by known calcium dynamics. Diffusion and buffering would flatten such gradients over times much shorter than required. Additionally, a generic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ elevation lacks the specificity to encode a precise cortical docking interface for the phragmoplast.\n\n5. Option E proposes nucleus-proximal histone methylation triggered by PPB contact, leading to site-specific expression of attractant proteins only at telophase. Gene expression and protein trafficking are not spatially restricted to a precise cortical annulus by mere nuclear positioning in this manner, and the timing of transcription, translation, and targeted membrane delivery is unlikely to achieve the needed precision and kinetics. Furthermore, the PPB does not function by pressing on the nucleus to establish positional cues; cortical memory is encoded at the membrane/cell wall, not via chromatin marks that would have to be translated into highly localized membrane patterning de novo.\n\nBy process of elimination using physical and biological constraints—stability, spatial specificity at the cortex, compatibility with known cytoskeletal and signaling dynamics—Option A uniquely provides a plausible, mechanistically coherent explanation: persistent, membrane-associated protein complexes at the CDZ serve as cortical landmarks that dock and align the phragmoplast for correct cell plate fusion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1776464"}]}
