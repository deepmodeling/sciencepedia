This practice explores how the speed of passive diffusion becomes a limiting factor as a cell's volume increases. By calculating and comparing the time it takes a molecule to travel within a small prokaryote versus a large eukaryote, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for why the evolution of complex intracellular transport systems was a necessity for eukaryotic life [@problem_id:2288081].", "id": "2288081", "problem": "To understand the physical constraints that shape cellular architecture, consider the process of passive diffusion within a cell. We will model a typical prokaryotic cell and a typical eukaryotic cell as simple spheres. The prokaryotic cell has a diameter of $1.0\\ \\mu\\text{m}$, while the eukaryotic cell has a diameter of $20\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nA small molecule, such as glucose, must travel from the cell membrane to various locations within the cell to be utilized. The characteristic time for a molecule to diffuse across a certain distance is a key factor in the efficiency of cellular processes. Assume the cytoplasm in both cells has a consistency such that the diffusion coefficient for this small molecule is $D = 5.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$.\n\nCalculate the approximate time it would take for the molecule to diffuse from the cell periphery (membrane) to the cell's geometric center for both the prokaryote and the eukaryote. Based on your calculations, select the option below that presents the correct approximate times and the most accurate biological conclusion. For the purposes of this problem, the time values presented in the options have been rounded to two significant figures.\n\nA. Prokaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $1.0\\ \\text{s}$. The substantial increase in diffusion time for the eukaryote suggests that passive diffusion is too slow to support the metabolic needs of a large cell, necessitating the evolution of active intracellular transport systems.\n\nB. Prokaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $0.050\\ \\text{s}$. The diffusion time scales linearly with cell radius, so the 20-fold increase in radius leads to a 20-fold increase in time, a manageable difference that does not require specialized transport.\n\nC. Prokaryote: $5.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $0.20\\ \\text{s}$. The much longer diffusion time in eukaryotes is primarily due to their more structured and dense cytoplasm, which increases the effective diffusion distance.\n\nD. Prokaryote: $1.0\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$. The faster diffusion in eukaryotes demonstrates that their complex endomembrane system creates efficient channels for molecular transport, making them superior to prokaryotes.\n\nE. Prokaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $1.0\\ \\text{s}$. On a biological timescale, these two durations are functionally equivalent. Therefore, active transport systems in eukaryotes must have evolved for purposes other than overcoming diffusion limitations, such as targeted delivery to specific organelles.\n\n", "solution": "The characteristic diffusive time across a distance is estimated from the mean-square displacement relation for diffusion. For motion along one coordinate (appropriate for a radial estimate from membrane to center), the relation is $\\langle x^{2} \\rangle = 2 D t$, giving a characteristic time\n$$\nt \\approx \\frac{L^{2}}{2 D}.\n$$\nHere, the distance from the cell periphery to the geometric center is the cell radius $R$, so take $L = R$.\n\nFor the prokaryote, the diameter is $1.0\\ \\mu\\text{m}$, so the radius is $R_{p} = 0.5\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{m}$.

Moreover, diffusion time scales as $t \\propto L^{2}$, so the 20-fold increase in radius from prokaryote to eukaryote yields roughly a 400-fold increase in diffusion time (from milliseconds to about one second), indicating that passive diffusion becomes limiting over eukaryotic length scales and supporting the biological conclusion that active intracellular transport systems are necessary in larger cells.

This exercise contrasts how prokaryotes and eukaryotes perform the essential process of cellular respiration by localizing the reactions in different parts of the cell.

Both Organism A and Organism B are eukaryotes.\n\n", "solution": "Principle 1: Prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles (including mitochondria). Consequently, glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, the Krebs cycle enzymes are cytosolic or associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane, and the electron transport chain resides in the plasma membrane. Thus, oxidative phosphorylation uses the proton motive force across the plasma membrane.\n\nPrinciple 2: Eukaryotic cells possess mitochondria, which are double-membrane-bound organelles. In eukaryotes, glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, the Krebs cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, and the electron transport chain with ATP synthase (oxidative phosphorylation) is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nApplication to Organism A: The description states that glycolysis is in the cytoplasm, with subsequent Krebs cycle reactions in the cytoplasm and the electron transport chain at the inner surface of the cell membrane.

This final practice challenges you to apply your knowledge of cell wall composition to a classic microbiology puzzle involving the Gram stain. You will predict the outcome of this bacterial staining procedure when applied to a eukaryotic yeast cell, requiring you to reason from first principles about the physical and chemical interactions between the dyes and the distinct biopolymers of prokaryotic versus eukaryotic cell walls [@problem_id:2288061].", "id": "2288061", "problem": "A microbiology student is conducting research on symbiotic relationships and is analyzing a co-culture containing both a species of Gram-positive bacteria and a species of budding yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*), a unicellular eukaryotic fungus. To visualize the organisms, the student performs a standard Gram stain. This procedure involves four key steps applied sequentially:\n\n1.  Application of crystal violet (the primary stain).\n2.  Application of Gram's iodine (a mordant that complexes with crystal violet).\n3.  A wash with an alcohol-acetone mixture (the decolorizer).\n4.  Application of safranin (a counterstain).\n\nIt is known that the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria consists of a very thick, highly cross-linked layer of peptidoglycan, which retains the crystal violet-iodine complex during the decolorization step, making them appear purple. In contrast, the cell wall of the yeast is a thick structure composed primarily of polysaccharides like chitin and glucans, and it completely lacks peptidoglycan.\n\nBased on an understanding of the molecular interactions during the Gram stain procedure and the fundamental chemical differences between the bacterial peptidoglycan wall and the eukaryotic yeast cell wall, select the most accurate prediction for the appearance of the yeast cells and the correct reasoning behind it.\n\nA. The yeast cells will appear pink. The absence of peptidoglycan means they function as Gram-negative cells, as the crystal violet-iodine complex cannot be anchored and is easily washed out by the decolorizer, allowing the cells to take up the safranin counterstain.\nB. The yeast cells will appear purple. Their thick, robust cell wall, although made of chitin and glucans, dehydrates and shrinks during the alcohol wash, which reduces its porosity and traps the large crystal violet-iodine complexes inside, thus resisting decolorization.\nC. The yeast cells will appear colorless. The unique composition of the chitin-glucan wall prevents the entry of the charged crystal violet dye molecules in the first place, so the cells are never stained and remain invisible under bright-field microscopy.\nD. The yeast cells will appear brown. The Gram's iodine mordant chemically reacts with the chitin polymer, forming a stable, dark brown precipitate that permanently stains the cell wall and masks any effect from the crystal violet or safranin.\n\n", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the outcome of a Gram stain procedure on yeast cells (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) and to provide the correct underlying reason, considering their cell wall composition. To do this, we must analyze how each step of the Gram stain interacts with the yeast cell's structure compared to a bacterium's.\n\n**Step 1: Role of the Primary Stain (Crystal Violet)**\nCrystal violet is a small, positively charged dye that can pass through the cell walls and plasma membranes of most cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. It stains the cytoplasm of all cells in the sample, including the bacteria and the yeast. At this stage, everything appears purple.\n\n**Step 2: Role of the Mordant (Gram's Iodine)**\nIodine is added as a mordant. It enters the cells and forms a large, insoluble complex with the crystal violet molecules (the CV-I complex). These complexes are much larger than the individual dye molecules and become trapped within the cytoplasm. At this point, all cells are still purple.\n\n**Step 3: The Decolorization Step (Alcohol-Acetone)**\nThis is the critical differential step. The alcohol-acetone mixture acts as a lipid solvent and a dehydrating agent. Its effect depends entirely on the cell wall's structure.\n-   In Gram-positive bacteria, the decolorizer dehydrates the thick, multi-layered peptidoglycan wall. This causes the pores in the wall to shrink, making it impermeable to the large CV-I complexes, which are then trapped inside. The cells remain purple.\n-   In Gram-negative bacteria, the decolorizer dissolves the outer lipid membrane and also damages the very thin peptidoglycan layer, which cannot be sufficiently dehydrated to trap the CV-I complex. The CV-I complex is washed out, leaving the cells colorless.\n-   Now consider the yeast cell. It has a thick wall composed of chitin and glucans. Like peptidoglycan, this polysaccharide network is susceptible to dehydration by alcohol. The alcohol wash causes the yeast cell wall to shrink and its porosity to decrease significantly. This physical change traps the large CV-I complexes within the yeast cell, preventing them from being washed out. Therefore, the yeast cell behaves analogously to a Gram-positive bacterium in this step, retaining the primary stain.\n\n**Step 4: Role of the Counterstain (Safranin)**\nSafranin is a pink/red dye that is applied last.\n-   The colorless Gram-negative bacteria will take up the safranin and appear pink/red.\n-   The Gram-positive bacteria, which are already stained a deep purple, will also take up the safranin, but the purple color of the CV-I complex is much more intense and masks the pink color. They remain purple.\n-   Similarly, the yeast cells, having retained the purple CV-I complex, will not show the pink safranin stain. They will remain purple.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options:**\nBased on this analysis, the yeast cells will appear purple after the full Gram stain procedure. They are often described as being \"Gram-positive\" or \"Gram-variable\" for this reason, although the biochemical basis (chitin/glucan dehydration) is distinct from that of true Gram-positive bacteria (peptidoglycan dehydration).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n-   **A is incorrect.** While it is true that yeast lack peptidoglycan, this does not automatically make them functionally Gram-negative. The physical properties of the yeast's own thick wall are what determine the outcome of the decolorization step, not simply the absence of peptidoglycan.\n-   **B is correct.** It accurately predicts the final color (purple) and provides the correct mechanism: the thick chitin-glucan wall dehydrates and shrinks in the presence of alcohol, reducing its permeability and trapping the large crystal violet-iodine complexes inside, thus preventing decolorization.\n-   **C is incorrect.** Crystal violet and other biological stains readily penetrate the yeast cell wall. If this were true, staining yeast for microscopy would be impossible with common dyes, which is not the case.\n-   **D is incorrect.** This describes a fictitious chemical reaction. While iodine can be used in tests for polysaccharides like starch (the iodine-starch test), it does not form a permanent brown precipitate with chitin in the context of a Gram stain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}]}
