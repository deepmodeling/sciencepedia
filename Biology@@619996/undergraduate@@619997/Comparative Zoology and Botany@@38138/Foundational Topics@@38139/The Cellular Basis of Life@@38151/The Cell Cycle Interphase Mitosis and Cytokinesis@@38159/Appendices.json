This first exercise introduces a fundamental quantitative method used by cell biologists to estimate the duration of different phases. By analyzing a population of asynchronously dividing cells, such as those in a plant meristem, we can directly relate the number of cells observed in a given phase to the time spent in that phase, allowing us to translate a microscopic snapshot into a temporal map of the cell cycle [@problem_id:1778982].", "problem": "A botany student is investigating the cell cycle in the apical meristem of a broad bean (*Vicia faba*) root tip. It is known from previous studies that the complete cell cycle for these meristematic cells takes 22.0 hours. The student prepares a microscope slide of a longitudinal section of the root tip, stains it to visualize the chromosomes, and observes a total of 1250 cells in the field of view. The student's counts for each phase of the cell cycle are as follows: 1045 cells in interphase, 110 cells in prophase, 42 cells in metaphase, 18 cells in anaphase, and 35 cells in telophase. Assuming the population of cells is asynchronous and uniformly distributed throughout the cycle, calculate the approximate duration of anaphase. Express your answer in minutes, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "For an asynchronous, uniformly cycling population, the fraction of cells observed in a given phase equals the fraction of the total cycle time spent in that phase. If $N_{\\text{A}}$ is the number of cells in anaphase, $N$ is the total number of cells observed, and $T$ is the total cell cycle duration, then the anaphase duration $t_{\\text{A}}$ is\n$$\nt_{\\text{A}}=\\frac{N_{\\text{A}}}{N}\\,T.\n$$\nWith $N_{\\text{A}}=18$, $N=1250$, and $T=22.0$ hours,\n$$\nt_{\\text{A}}=\\frac{18}{1250}\\times 22.0\\ \\text{hours}=0.3168\\ \\text{hours}.\n$$\nConverting hours to minutes by multiplying by $60$,\n$$\nt_{\\text{A}}=0.3168\\times 60=19.008\\ \\text{minutes}.\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $19.0$ minutes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{19.0}$$", "id": "1778982"}, {"introduction": "While timing the stages is crucial, it is equally important to precisely account for the genetic material as it is duplicated and segregated. This problem challenges you to track two key metrics—chromosome number and DNA content ($C$)—throughout the mitotic cycle of a haploid cell [@problem_id:1778993]. Accurately distinguishing between these two quantities, especially during the G2 phase and anaphase, is fundamental to mastering the mechanics of cell division and preventing common misconceptions.", "problem": "In the life cycle of a typical moss (Phylum Bryophyta), the dominant generation is the haploid gametophyte, which develops from a haploid spore. A single haploid moss spore lands on a suitable moist substrate and begins to germinate, eventually forming a filamentous structure called a protonema. Consider a single cell from this developing protonema as it undergoes its first mitotic cell cycle.\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, let $n$ represent the haploid number of chromosomes (the number of chromosomes in one complete, unreplicated set) and let $C$ represent the amount of DNA, by mass, in that same unreplicated haploid set.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the state of the cell, represented as an ordered pair (Chromosome Number, DNA Content), at four distinct stages: 1) the initial spore before germination, 2) the cell in the G2 phase of interphase, 3) the cell during the anaphase stage of mitosis, and 4) one of the two identical daughter cells immediately after cytokinesis is complete?\n\nA.

Stage 1: $(n, C)$; Stage 2: $(n, 2C)$; Stage 3: $(2n, 4C)$; Stage 4: $(n, 2C)$", "solution": "We are tracking two quantities through the first mitotic cycle of a haploid moss gametophyte cell: chromosome number, defined operationally by the number of centromeres present in the cell, and DNA content by mass relative to one unreplicated haploid set. By definition, the haploid number is $n$ and the DNA content of one unreplicated haploid set is $C$.\n\nStage 1 (initial spore before germination): The spore is haploid and its chromosomes are unreplicated prior to entering S phase. Therefore its chromosome number is $n$ and its DNA content is $C$. Hence Stage 1 is $(n, C)$.\n\nStage 2 (G2 phase of interphase): After S phase but before mitosis, the cell remains haploid with respect to homolog number, so the chromosome number, counted by centromeres, remains $n$. However, each chromosome has been replicated to form two sister chromatids, doubling the DNA mass. Therefore DNA content is $2C$. Hence Stage 2 is $(n, 2C)$.\n\nStage 3 (anaphase of mitosis): During anaphase, sister chromatids separate and each chromatid becomes an independent chromosome by centromere count. Thus the chromosome number doubles to $2n$. No DNA synthesis occurs during mitosis, and the total DNA in the single cell remains that present in G2 until cytokinesis partitions it; therefore the DNA content at this instant is $2C$. Hence Stage 3 is $(2n, 2C)$.\n\nStage 4 (one daughter cell immediately after cytokinesis): Cytokinesis partitions the chromatids equally into two daughter cells. Each daughter cell receives $n$ chromosomes (one chromatid per original chromosome) and the corresponding DNA content per daughter is $C$. Hence Stage 4 is $(n, C)$.\n\nThe only option matching $(n, C)$; $(n, 2C)$; $(2n, 2C)$; $(n, C)$ is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1778993"}, {"introduction": "The process of mitosis is remarkably accurate, but errors can and do occur. This final practice explores the consequences of one such error: nondisjunction during anaphase [@problem_id:1778956]. By tracing the fate of chromosomes following a failure of sister chromatid separation in a single plant meristem cell, you will predict the genetic makeup of the resulting daughter cells and the large-scale, visible phenotype that emerges from their proliferation. This exercise provides a concrete example of how a microscopic mistake can lead to somatic mosaicism, bridging the gap between cell biology, genetics, and organismal development.", "problem": "A hypothetical diploid flowering plant, *Botanica exemplar*, has a diploid chromosome number of $2n=20$. A single gene, CHL, which controls chlorophyll synthesis, is located on chromosome 3. The dominant allele C results in normal green leaves, while the recessive allele c leads to non-pigmented (white) tissue. You are studying a plant that is heterozygous for this gene (Cc) and therefore uniformly green.\n\nIn a single cell within the shoot apical meristem (SAM), a mitotic error occurs. During anaphase, the two sister chromatids of the chromosome 3 that carries the dominant C allele fail to separate and are pulled to the same pole. The sister chromatids of the homologous chromosome 3 carrying the recessive c allele, as well as all other chromosomes, separate normally. Assume that both daughter cells resulting from this division are viable and continue to divide, contributing to the growth of a new shoot.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the genotypes of the two daughter cells produced by this abnormal division and the most likely visible outcome on the shoot that develops from this meristem?\n\nA. The daughter cells have genotypes C ($2n-1=19$) and Ccc ($2n+1=21$). The resulting shoot will have sectors of green tissue and sectors of lethal tissue, causing stunted growth.\n\nB. The daughter cells have genotypes CC ($2n=20$) and cc ($2n=20$). The resulting shoot will exhibit \"twin spotting,\" with adjacent small sectors of dark green and white tissue.\n\nC. One daughter cell is normal with genotype Cc ($2n=20$) and the other undergoes apoptosis. The resulting shoot will be phenotypically normal and uniformly green.\n\nD. The daughter cells have genotypes c ($2n-1=19$) and Ccc ($2n+1=21$). The resulting shoot will be variegated, with distinct sectors of white tissue and green tissue.\n\nE. Both daughter cells have the genotype Ccc ($2n+1=21$). The entire resulting shoot will be green but may show morphological abnormalities due to trisomy.", "solution": "The starting somatic cell is diploid with $2n=20$ and heterozygous at the CHL locus on chromosome 3, genotype Cc. After S phase, chromosome 3 consists of two sister chromatids for the homolog carrying C and two sister chromatids for the homolog carrying c.\n\nDuring mitotic anaphase, the specified error is nondisjunction of the two sister chromatids of the C-bearing chromosome 3: both C sister chromatids move to the same pole. The sister chromatids of the homolog carrying c separate normally, so one c chromatid goes to each pole. All other chromosomes segregate normally, contributing one sister chromatid to each pole.\n\nTherefore, at telophase/cytokinesis:\n- One daughter cell receives two C sister chromatids and one c chromatid for chromosome 3. Counting the rest of the genome (which segregated normally), this cell is trisomic for chromosome 3, with $2n+1=21$ chromosomes and CHL genotype Ccc (i.e., at least one dominant C present).\n- The other daughter cell receives zero C chromatids and one c chromatid for chromosome 3. With the rest of the genome normal, this cell is monosomic for chromosome 3, with $2n-1=19$ chromosomes and CHL genotype c (i.e., no dominant allele present).\n\nPhenotypically, CHL shows dominance of C for green tissue, and c confers white tissue only when no C allele is present. The trisomic Ccc lineage will be green, while the monosomic c lineage will be white, assuming viability as stated. Because both daughter cells are viable and contribute to the shoot, clonal proliferation from each will create distinct somatic sectors with different pigmentation. This yields variegation with sectors of white tissue (from the monosomic c clone) and green tissue (from the trisomic Ccc clone).\n\nThis outcome matches the genotypes and visible phenotype described in option D. The other options are inconsistent: A assigns the monosomic genotype as C rather than c; B posits euploid CC and cc and invokes twin spotting, which arises from mitotic recombination rather than the described nondisjunction; C contradicts the assumption that both daughters are viable; E is impossible because both daughters cannot become trisomic from a single sister-chromatid nondisjunction event.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1778956"}]}
