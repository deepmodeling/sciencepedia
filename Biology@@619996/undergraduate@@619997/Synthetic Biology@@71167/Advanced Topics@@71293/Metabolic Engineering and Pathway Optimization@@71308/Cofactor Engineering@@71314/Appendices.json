Unstable cofactors can be lost to side reactions, creating a metabolic drain that reduces pathway efficiency and increases the overall cost to the cell. In this practice problem [@problem_id:2026814], you will quantify this cost by comparing two pathway designs: one using a degradation-prone $FADH_2$ intermediate and another using the more stable $NADPH$, translating the chemical instability into a concrete $ATP$ burden.", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is engineering an *Escherichia coli* strain to produce a valuable specialty chemical, 'P', from a substrate 'S'. The final step in their biosynthetic pathway is an oxidation reaction.\n\n**Original Pathway (System 1):** The initial design uses an engineered FADH2-dependent oxidase. The overall stoichiometry is such that one mole of substrate S is converted to one mole of product P, requiring the consumption of one mole of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH). The reaction mechanism involves an FADH2 intermediate, which is regenerated from Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) using NADH. However, under the high-aeration conditions required for the bioprocess, the free FADH2 cofactor is highly unstable and undergoes oxidative degradation. This degradation is a wasteful side-reaction that consumes FADH2 without producing any P. The kinetics of FADH2 consumption within the cell can be modeled as follows:\n- The rate of the productive reaction leading to P is first-order with respect to the FADH2 concentration, governed by a pseudo-first-order rate constant $k_p = 250 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n- The rate of FADH2 degradation is also first-order with respect to the FADH2 concentration, with a rate constant $k_d = 80 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n\n**Engineered Pathway (System 2):** To address the cofactor instability, the team redesigns the pathway by replacing the FADH2-dependent oxidase with a different enzyme that directly uses the more stable Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) as a cofactor. The stoichiometry of this new reaction is one mole of S and one mole of NADPH consumed to produce one mole of P. Under the process conditions, the stability of NADPH is excellent, and its non-productive degradation can be considered negligible.\n\n**Metabolic Cost:** In this particular *E. coli* strain, the metabolic burden of regenerating these cofactors from central metabolism can be quantified in terms of an opportunity cost in Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) equivalents.\n- The metabolic cost to regenerate 1 mole of NADH is $C_{\\text{NADH}} = 2.5$ moles of ATP.\n- The metabolic cost to regenerate 1 mole of NADPH is $C_{\\text{NADPH}} = 3.5$ moles of ATP.\n\nAssuming both pathways operate at a steady state where the rate of cofactor regeneration from central metabolism is perfectly balanced by its total consumption rate, calculate the ratio of the total ATP cost per mole of product P for the original pathway (System 1) to the engineered pathway (System 2).
