This strain has a gene encoding a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) stably integrated into its chromosome. The GFP gene is expressed from a constitutive promoter, acting as a reporter for the general protein synthesis capacity of the cell.\n\nThe researcher then introduces a high-copy-number plasmid into this strain. The plasmid carries a synthetic gene circuit which can be activated by adding an inducer molecule to the growth medium. The expression of both the chromosomal GFP and the plasmid-based circuit depends on a shared, limited pool of cellular resources.\n\nA simplified model is proposed to describe this resource competition. The allocation of resources to any given gene is proportional to its \"expression demand.\" The total demand is the sum of the demands from all active genes. The key parameters of the system, defined relative to the expression demand of the single chromosomal GFP reporter gene, are as follows:\n\n- The total expression demand of all essential native host genes is $\\gamma$ times the demand of the single GFP reporter gene, with $\\gamma = 2000$.\n- The plasmid is maintained at an average copy number of $N_p = 25$ per cell.\n- When fully induced, the expression-demand-per-gene of the plasmid circuit is $\\alpha$ times that of the chromosomal GFP reporter gene, with $\\alpha = 50$.\n- In the absence of an inducer, the plasmid circuit is not completely silent and exhibits a basal \"leaky\" expression. In this uninduced state, its expression-demand-per-gene is $\\beta$ times that of the chromosomal GFP reporter gene, with $\\beta = 0.5$.\n\nThe metabolic burden, $M$, is defined as the fractional reduction in the steady-state GFP fluorescence observed when the system is shifted from the uninduced state to the fully induced state. This is given by the formula $M = \\frac{F_{\\text{uninduced}} - F_{\\text{induced}}}{F_{\\text{uninduced}}}$, where $F_{\\text{uninduced}}$ and $F_{\\text{induced}}$ are the steady-state fluorescence levels in the uninduced and induced conditions, respectively.\n\nAssuming that the steady-state fluorescence is directly proportional to the rate of GFP synthesis, calculate the metabolic burden $M$. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The model states that allocation of the limited cellular resources to any gene is proportional to its expression demand, and the fraction allocated equals the demand of that gene divided by the total demand from all active genes.

The core of their design is an epigenetic switch coupled to a resource-sensitive expression system.\n\nThe epigenetic switch is built around a synthetic histone modifier protein, $M$, which promotes its own expression by maintaining its own gene in an active chromatin state. The concentration of $M$, denoted as $m(t)$, is governed by the following dynamical equation, which models its autocatalytic production and first-order degradation:\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\alpha_m \\frac{m^2}{K_m^2 + m^2} - \\gamma_m m\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha_m$ is the maximum production rate of $M$, $K_m$ is the concentration of $M$ required for half-maximal self-activation (a measure of feedback sensitivity), and $\\gamma_m$ is the effective first-order degradation and dilution rate constant of $M$. The Hill coefficient for self-activation is fixed at 2.\n\nTo sense metabolic stress, a \"burden\" protein, $B$, is expressed from an inducible promoter. High-level expression of $B$ sequesters a significant fraction of the cell's translational machinery (e.g., ribosomes), imposing a metabolic load. This resource competition negatively impacts the production of all other proteins, including $M$. This effect is modeled by making the maximum production rate of $M$ a decreasing function of the steady-state concentration of the burden protein, $B$. Specifically, the effective maximum production rate is given by:\n$$\n\\alpha_m(B) = \\frac{\\alpha_{m,0}}{1 + B/K_B}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{m,0}$ is the basal maximum production rate in the absence of any burden ($B=0$), and $K_B$ is a constant representing the cell's tolerance to the metabolic burden.\n\nInitially, with no burden protein present ($B=0$), the system is designed to be bistable and is resting in the stable high-expression \"ON\" state, characterized by a high concentration of $M$. An experiment is then conducted where the concentration of the burden protein $B$ is slowly increased from zero. This increase in metabolic load will eventually destabilize the \"ON\" state.\n\nDetermine the critical concentration of the burden protein, $B_{crit}$, at which the high-expression \"ON\" state of the modifier $M$ vanishes through a saddle-node bifurcation, causing the system to irreversibly collapse into the \"OFF\" state (where $m=0$).
