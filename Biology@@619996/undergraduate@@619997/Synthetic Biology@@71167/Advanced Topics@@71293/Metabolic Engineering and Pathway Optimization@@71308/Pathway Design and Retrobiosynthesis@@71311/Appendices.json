Your task is to select the best enzyme homolog based on a specific performance goal, learning to distinguish between important metrics like final product concentration (titer), per-cell productivity, and the overall metabolic burden on the host.", "problem": "A team of bioengineers is working to produce a novel, high-value blue pigment called \"cyanthocyanin\" in the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. The production of cyanthocyanin from a common cellular precursor requires a two-step synthetic pathway involving enzymes EncA and EncB. Through previous experiments, a highly efficient version of EncA has already been identified. However, the reaction catalyzed by EncB is the rate-limiting step in the pathway.\n\nTo optimize this step, the team has identified three different homologs of the gene for enzyme EncB from different microorganisms: `encB_1`, `encB_2`, and `encB_3`. The goal is to determine which of these three enzyme variants yields the highest final concentration (titer) of cyanthocyanin.\n\nThe engineers constructed four different plasmids:\n1.  **pControl**: Contains the gene for EncA only. This serves as a negative control for cyanthocyanin production.\n2.  **pEncB1**: Contains the genes for EncA and `encB_1`.\n3.  **pEncB2**: Contains the genes for EncA and `encB_2`.\n4.  **pEncB3**: Contains the genes for EncA and `encB_3`.\n\nEach plasmid was transformed into the same strain of *E. coli*. The four resulting strains were then cultivated in flasks for 72 hours under identical conditions (temperature, medium, and aeration). After 72 hours, two measurements were taken for each culture: the final cell density, measured as the Optical Density at 600 nm (OD600), and the cyanthocyanin concentration in the culture supernatant, quantified using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The results are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Strain ID | Plasmid Used | Final OD600 | Cyanthocyanin Titer (g/L) |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|\n| E.c-Ctrl  | pControl     | 5.2         | 0.00                      |\n| E.c-Test1 | pEncB1       | 4.8         | 2.15                      |\n| E.c-Test2 | pEncB2       | 2.5         | 2.45                      |\n| E.c-Test3 | pEncB3       | 4.6         | 1.85                      |\n\nBased on the experimental objective to identify the enzyme variant that results in the highest product titer, which of the following conclusions is the most accurate?\n\nA. Enzyme `encB_1` is the best choice because its strain (E.c-Test1) shows a good balance between high cell growth and high product formation.\n\nB. Enzyme `encB_2` is the best choice because it produces the highest final concentration of cyanthocyanin.\n\nC. Enzyme `encB_2` is the best choice because it has the highest per-cell productivity (specific productivity).\n\nD. The experiment is flawed because the significant drop in OD600 for strain E.c-Test2 indicates that the `encB_2` enzyme or the cyanthocyanin product is highly toxic, making it unsuitable for production.\n\nE. Enzyme `encB_3` is the least effective variant, and its performance is similar to that of `encB_1`, indicating a similar catalytic efficiency.", "solution": "The primary objective of the experiment is explicitly stated: to identify the enzyme variant that \"yields the highest final concentration (titer) of cyanthocyanin.\" To answer this question, we must directly compare the final cyanthocyanin titers produced by the three test strains.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the data for the primary objective.\nWe look at the \"Cyanthocyanin Titer (g/L)\" column in the provided table.\n- Strain E.c-Test1 (with `encB_1`) produced 2.15 g/L.\n- Strain E.c-Test2 (with `encB_2`) produced 2.45 g/L.\n- Strain E.c-Test3 (with `encB_3`) produced 1.85 g/L.\n\nComparing these values, 2.45 g/L is the highest titer. This was achieved by the strain E.c-Test2, which expresses the enzyme `encB_2`. Therefore, based solely on the stated objective, `encB_2` is the best-performing enzyme. This directly supports option B.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the other options to confirm they are incorrect.\n\nOption A states that `encB_1` is the best choice due to a \"balance\" between growth and production. While E.c-Test1 does show robust growth (OD600 of 4.8) and good production (2.15 g/L), the objective was not to find a \"balance\" but to find the \"highest product titer.\" Since 2.15 g/L is less than 2.45 g/L, this option is incorrect as it deviates from the primary goal.\n\nOption C suggests `encB_2` is best because it has the highest \"specific productivity\" (titer per unit of cell density). Let's calculate this metric for each strain:\n- Specific Productivity of E.c-Test1: $\\frac{2.15 \\text{ g/L}}{4.8 \\text{ OD600}} \\approx 0.448 \\text{ g/L per OD unit}$.\n- Specific Productivity of E.c-Test2: $\\frac{2.45 \\text{ g/L}}{2.5 \\text{ OD600}} = 0.980 \\text{ g/L per OD unit}$.\n- Specific Productivity of E.c-Test3: $\\frac{1.85 \\text{ g/L}}{4.6 \\text{ OD600}} \\approx 0.402 \\text{ g/L per OD unit}$.\nThe calculation confirms that `encB_2` does indeed result in the highest specific productivity. However, the question asks for the highest *titer* (absolute concentration), not the highest *specific productivity* (rate per cell). Although in this specific case the same enzyme happens to be the best by both metrics, the reasoning given in option C is different from the reasoning required by the problem statement. Option B is more direct and accurate because it refers to the final concentration, which is what \"titer\" means. In a scenario where an enzyme yielded the highest specific productivity but not the highest overall titer (e.g., due to extreme toxicity causing very low cell density), option C would be incorrect. Option B remains correct as it directly addresses the stated goal of highest titer.\n\nOption D claims the experiment is \"flawed\" due to the toxicity observed in E.c-Test2. The OD600 of 2.5 is significantly lower than the control (5.2) and the other test strains, indicating a high metabolic burden or toxicity. While this is a critical consideration for scaling up a bioprocess, it does not invalidate the conclusion of this initial screening experiment. The experiment successfully identified the variant that produces the highest titer under these specific conditions. It is not \"flawed\"; rather, it has yielded an important result that also reveals a challenge (toxicity) for future optimization. Therefore, this option is an overstatement and incorrect.\n\nOption E claims that `encB_3` and `encB_1` have similar performance. Comparing their titers (1.85 g/L for `encB_3` vs. 2.15 g/L for `encB_1`), there is a noticeable difference of about 16%. In the context of metabolic engineering, this is a significant difference, not a similar performance. Thus, this statement is inaccurate.\n\nConclusion: Option B is the most accurate conclusion because it directly addresses the experimental objective using the correct data (final titer) and makes a correct claim (that `encB_2` resulted in the highest concentration of cyanthocyanin).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2054376"}]}
