This exercise [@problem_id:2043417] presents a typical Western blot result and asks you to diagnose the underlying molecular events, helping you connect the theoretical concept of amber suppression to the practical reality of competition within the cell's translation machinery.", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is working to create a novel biosensor in *Escherichia coli*. Their strategy involves incorporating a fluorescent non-standard amino acid (nsAA) into a specific site within a target protein, let's call it Sensor Protein X (SPX). To achieve this, they are using the amber suppression technique.\n\nThe team has engineered their *E. coli* strain to express an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and its corresponding transfer RNA, which has a CUA anticodon ($\\mathrm{tRNA}_{\\mathrm{CUA}}$). The gene encoding SPX was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to replace the codon for a specific internal amino acid with a UAG (amber) stop codon. The cells are cultured in a minimal medium supplemented with the necessary nutrients and the nsAA.\n\nAfter inducing protein expression, the team prepares a lysate from the cells and analyzes the protein products using a Western blot with an antibody that specifically targets SPX. The blot reveals two distinct bands. One band appears at the expected molecular weight for the full-length SPX containing the nsAA. A second, equally prominent band is observed at a lower molecular weight, which corresponds precisely to the size of the SPX protein if it were truncated at the position of the engineered UAG codon.\n\nAssuming the experimental setup (plasmids, sequences, and culture conditions) is correct, what is the most probable molecular explanation for the presence of the shorter, truncated protein band?\n\nA. The native *E. coli* Release Factor 1 (RF1) is competing with the engineered $\\mathrm{tRNA}_{\\mathrm{CUA}}$ for binding to the UAG codon at the ribosome, causing premature termination of translation.\n\nB. The introduced orthogonal aaRS is unstable and being rapidly degraded, leading to a population of uncharged $\\mathrm{tRNA}_{\\mathrm{CUA}}$ that cannot participate in translation.\n\nC. The gene for SPX has spontaneously mutated, creating a second stop codon upstream of the intended UAG site.\n\nD. The non-standard amino acid is cytotoxic, causing a global reduction in translational fidelity and leading to random protein truncation.\n\nE. The orthogonal aaRS is exhibiting promiscuity and is incorrectly charging the $\\mathrm{tRNA}_{\\mathrm{CUA}}$ with one of the 20 canonical amino acids instead of the nsAA.", "solution": "Given: The engineered system uses an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to charge an orthogonal $\\mathrm{tRNA}_{\\mathrm{CUA}}$, and the SPX gene contains an internal $UAG$ codon. Western blot shows two bands: a full-length SPX (indicative of successful suppression and nsAA incorporation) and a truncated SPX exactly corresponding to termination at the engineered $UAG$ site.\n\nStep 1: State the fundamental molecular principle of bacterial translation termination. In wild-type $\\mathrm{Escherichia\\ coli}$, $\\mathrm{RF1}$ recognizes $UAG$ and $UAA$ stop codons at the ribosomal A site and catalyzes peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, terminating translation precisely at the stop codon.\n\nStep 2: State the principle of amber suppression. Amber suppression relies on an introduced suppressor $\\mathrm{tRNA}_{\\mathrm{CUA}}$ that base-pairs with the $UAG$ codon and, when charged by an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase with the nsAA, allows insertion of the nsAA at that position and continuation of translation to yield full-length protein.\n\nStep 3: Describe the kinetic competition at the ribosome. At each $UAG$ codon, there is a kinetic competition at the A site between $\\mathrm{RF1}$ binding to induce termination and the suppressor $\\mathrm{tRNA}_{\\mathrm{CUA}}$ binding to insert the nsAA. The outcome is a mixture of products: when $\\mathrm{RF1}$ wins, translation terminates at $UAG$, yielding a truncated protein whose size matches termination at that exact position; when the suppressor $\\mathrm{tRNA}_{\\mathrm{CUA}}$ wins, full-length SPX is produced with the nsAA incorporated.\n\nStep 4: Connect the observed bands to this mechanism. The presence of two bands—one full-length and one truncated at exactly the engineered $UAG$—is the hallmark of incomplete amber suppression due to competition between $\\mathrm{RF1}$ and the suppressor $\\mathrm{tRNA}_{\\mathrm{CUA}}$.\n\nStep 5: Exclude alternatives by their predicted molecular consequences:\n- Option B (unstable aaRS leading to uncharged $\\mathrm{tRNA}_{\\mathrm{CUA}}$): An uncharged suppressor $\\mathrm{tRNA}$ would cause ribosomal stalling at $UAG$ and likely invoke trans-translation or quality control, reducing overall yield; it would not specifically produce a clean, precise truncation band coincident with $UAG$ while still also producing robust full-length product. The observed full-length band indicates that charged suppressor $\\mathrm{tRNA}$ is available.\n- Option C (second upstream stop codon): This would produce a shorter truncation than the one matching the engineered $UAG$, not a band that matches exactly the position of the engineered $UAG$. Moreover, a spontaneous upstream stop codon is unlikely and would not simultaneously explain the strong full-length band.\n- Option D (nsAA cytotoxicity causing global fidelity reduction): Global fidelity defects would lead to heterogeneous products and smearing or multiple aberrant bands, not a single, precise truncation exactly at $UAG$.\n- Option E (aaRS promiscuity charging with a canonical amino acid): Misacylation with a canonical amino acid would still yield full-length SPX (albeit with an incorrect residue at the site), not a truncated product. It cannot explain the strong band truncated precisely at $UAG$.\n\nConclusion: The most probable molecular explanation is competition between native $\\mathrm{RF1}$ and the suppressor $\\mathrm{tRNA}_{\\mathrm{CUA}}$ at the $UAG$ codon, producing a mixture of terminated (truncated) and suppressed (full-length) translation products.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2043417"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of incorporating non-standard amino acids is the ability to engineer the core molecular machinery. This practice moves beyond analyzing systems to designing them, which is a cornerstone of synthetic biology.

This is often achieved by engineering an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. Consider the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) from the archaeon *Methanocaldococcus jannaschii*. This enzyme is responsible for charging its cognate tRNA with the natural amino acid L-tyrosine.\n\nThe active site of the wild-type *M. jannaschii* TyrRS has evolved to specifically recognize L-tyrosine. A critical interaction for this recognition is a hydrogen bond network involving the phenolic hydroxyl group of the L-tyrosine substrate. Specifically, the side chain of residue Tyr32 in the enzyme's active site acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor from the hydroxyl group of the substrate L-tyrosine. This interaction contributes significantly to the binding affinity and specificity for L-tyrosine over other amino acids.\n\nA researcher wants to engineer this TyrRS to preferentially charge its tRNA with the non-canonical amino acid O-methyl-L-tyrosine (OmeTyr). In OmeTyr, the phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) of L-tyrosine is replaced by a methoxy group (-OCH3).\n\nBased on the principles of rational protein design, which of the following single point mutations to the *M. jannaschii* TyrRS is most likely to decrease the enzyme's affinity for L-tyrosine while simultaneously favoring the binding of O-methyl-L-tyrosine?\n\nA.

Let $E$ denote the enzyme active site and $S_{\\mathrm{Tyr}}$ the L-tyrosine substrate. The binding free energy in the wild type can be decomposed as\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}(S_{\\mathrm{Tyr}})=\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{vdW}}+\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{electrostatic}}+\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{HB}}+\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{desolv}}+\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{conf}} ,\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{HB}}<0$ arises from a specific hydrogen bond in which the side chain of residue Tyr32 acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor for the phenolic hydroxyl group of $S_{\\mathrm{Tyr}}$. This term contributes significantly to specificity for L-tyrosine.\n\nThe target non-canonical substrate is O-methyl-L-tyrosine, $S_{\\mathrm{Ome}}$, in which the phenolic $-{\\mathrm{OH}}$ is replaced by $-{\\mathrm{OCH_{3}}}$. This modification removes the hydrogen bond donor capability at that position and adds steric bulk and hydrophobic character near the phenolic oxygen. Consequently, a mutation that both removes the enzyme’s acceptor at position 32 and creates space or hydrophobic complementarity for the methyl substituent should reduce affinity for $S_{\\mathrm{Tyr}}$ while favoring $S_{\\mathrm{Ome}}$.\n\nWe now consider the effect of each single substitution on the change in binding free energy, $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$, relative to wild type. A positive $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$ indicates weakened binding; a negative value indicates strengthened binding.\n\nA. Y32A removes the Tyr32 phenolic oxygen (eliminating the acceptor), reduces side-chain volume at position 32, and increases local hydrophobicity.

Thus Y32A both disfavors L-tyrosine and favors O-methyl-L-tyrosine.\n\nB. Y32F removes the hydrogen bond acceptor but retains a bulky aromatic side chain with approximately the same volume as tyrosine (minus the hydroxyl). For $S_{\\mathrm{Tyr}}$, eliminating the acceptor raises $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}>0$, but for $S_{\\mathrm{Ome}}$ the retained bulk at position 32 may increase steric clash with the methoxy group and does not create a cavity to accommodate the methyl, making favorable accommodation less likely than with alanine.\n\nC. D182N alters a residue not implicated in the described phenolic recognition network; absent a specific counter-interaction for the methoxy group, the effect on selective recognition at the phenol pocket is unlikely to provide the desired tradeoff.\n\nD. G31A introduces extra steric bulk near the active site backbone, which can reduce space and flexibility without directly addressing the loss of the phenolic hydrogen bond; this risks weakening binding for both substrates.\n\nE. K210R is a conservative substitution distant from the phenolic recognition described; it is unlikely to modulate the critical interaction or create space for the methoxy group.\n\nTherefore, the mutation that most directly removes the critical hydrogen bond that favors L-tyrosine and simultaneously provides steric and hydrophobic accommodation for the methoxy substituent of O-methyl-L-tyrosine is Y32A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2043428"}, {"introduction": "Successfully expressing a protein of the expected size is a promising first step, but how can we be certain that the non-standard amino acid was actually incorporated?
