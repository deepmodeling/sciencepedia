This first exercise challenges you to diagnose and solve a common and critical issue arising from codon usage bias. By thinking like a synthetic biologist troubleshooting an engineered organism, you will explore why a simple synonymous codon swap can have drastic consequences for cell viability and how to restore balance to the system [@problem_id:2079126].", "problem": "In synthetic biology, whole-genome recoding is a technique used to alter an organism's genetic code, often to introduce new functionalities or to create genetic firewalls. Consider a hypothetical experiment where a strain of the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is created. In this synthetic strain, every single instance of the codon UAC, which codes for the amino acid Tyrosine, has been replaced with the synonymous codon UAU, which also codes for Tyrosine. The transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) that recognizes the UAC codon has the anticodon GUA, while the tRNA that recognizes the UAU codon has the anticodon AUA.\n\nIn wild-type yeast, the UAC codon is used significantly more often than the UAU codon to specify Tyrosine. Consequently, the cellular concentration of the tRNA with the GUA anticodon is much higher than that of the tRNA with the AUA anticodon. Upon creating the fully recoded UAC-to-UAU strain, investigators observe that it grows much more slowly than the wild-type strain.\n\nBased on the principles of protein translation, which of the following single genetic modifications is most likely to rescue the growth rate of this recoded yeast strain?\n\nA. Overexpress the gene encoding the tRNA with the anticodon AUA.\n\nB. Delete the gene encoding the tRNA with the anticodon GUA.\n\nC. Overexpress the gene encoding the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, the enzyme that attaches Tyrosine to all Tyrosine-tRNAs.\n\nD. Overexpress the gene encoding a tRNA that recognizes a Leucine codon.\n\nE. Introduce mutations in ribosomal proteins to globally decrease the fidelity of codon-anticodon pairing.", "solution": "The problem describes a synthetic yeast strain where all UAC codons (for Tyrosine) have been replaced by the synonymous UAU codon. This strain exhibits slow growth. We need to identify the most likely genetic modification to restore a normal growth rate.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the core problem.\nThe central dogma of molecular biology states that codons on a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript are read by ribosomes, and corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, carrying specific amino acids, bind to these codons. The efficiency of this process, called translation, is critical for protein synthesis and, by extension, for cell growth.\n\nStep 2: Understand the concept of codon usage bias and tRNA abundance.\nOrganisms do not use all synonymous codons with equal frequency. This phenomenon is known as codon usage bias. The cellular abundance of different tRNA species (isoacceptors) is often correlated with the frequency of their corresponding codons. A frequently used codon is typically decoded by a more abundant tRNA, leading to faster and more efficient translation.\n\nStep 3: Apply the concepts to the specific scenario.\nIn wild-type yeast, the UAC codon for Tyrosine is used more frequently than UAU. This implies that the cell maintains a higher concentration of the tRNA that recognizes UAC (the one with the GUA anticodon) and a lower concentration of the tRNA that recognizes UAU (the one with the AUA anticodon).\n\nIn the recoded strain, the situation is reversed. Every Tyrosine in every protein must now be encoded by a UAU codon. This creates a massive demand for the tRNA with the AUA anticodon, which is naturally scarce. The ribosomes will frequently pause at UAU codons, waiting for a rare AUA-tRNA to become available. This stalling effect drastically slows down overall protein synthesis, leading to the observed slow growth phenotype. The fundamental issue is a supply-demand mismatch: high demand for a low-supply resource (the AUA-tRNA).\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the proposed modifications.\n\nA. Overexpress the gene encoding the tRNA with the anticodon AUA.\nThis modification directly addresses the bottleneck. By increasing the transcription of the gene for the AUA-tRNA, the cellular concentration of this specific tRNA will rise. With a larger pool of AUA-tRNAs available, ribosomes will no longer have to wait as long at UAU codons. This will speed up translation, increase the rate of protein synthesis, and is therefore very likely to rescue the growth rate.\n\nB. Delete the gene encoding the tRNA with the anticodon GUA.\nThe GUA-tRNA recognizes the UAC codon, which is no longer present in the genome of the recoded strain. Deleting this now-obsolete tRNA might free up some cellular resources involved in its synthesis. However, it does nothing to alleviate the shortage of the AUA-tRNA, which is the direct cause of the slow growth. Therefore, this modification would not solve the problem.\n\nC. Overexpress the gene encoding the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase.\nThis enzyme is responsible for \"charging\" all Tyrosine-tRNAs (both GUA- and AUA-anticodon species) by attaching a Tyrosine molecule to them. While having properly charged tRNAs is essential for translation, the primary bottleneck in this scenario is the physical scarcity of the AUA-tRNA molecule itself, not the process of charging it. Increasing the amount of synthetase will not create more AUA-tRNA molecules. The factory is waiting for more trucks (tRNA), not for a faster way to load the few trucks that are available. So, this is not the most effective solution.\n\nD. Overexpress the gene encoding a tRNA that recognizes a Leucine codon.\nThis modification is irrelevant to the problem at hand. The issue is with the translation of Tyrosine codons, and changing the abundance of a tRNA for a completely different amino acid (Leucine) will not resolve the Tyrosine-specific bottleneck.\n\nE. Introduce mutations in ribosomal proteins to globally decrease the fidelity of codon-anticodon pairing.\nDecreasing the fidelity, or \"proofreading\" accuracy, of the ribosome might allow other, non-cognate tRNAs (or perhaps even the abundant GUA-tRNA) to occasionally misread the UAU codon. However, this is a highly detrimental strategy. It would lead to widespread errors in protein synthesis (mistranslation) for all codons, not just UAU. The resulting non-functional or misfolded proteins would likely be toxic to the cell, further inhibiting growth or even causing cell death. This is the opposite of a rescue strategy.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and logical solution to the problem of a high demand for a scarce tRNA is to increase the supply of that specific tRNA. Therefore, overexpressing the gene for the tRNA with the AUA anticodon is the correct strategy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2079126"}, {"introduction": "A successful recoding project effectively erases a codon from an organism's genetic dictionary, creating a \"blank\" codon. This exercise demonstrates a clever and practical method for verifying this erasure using a fluorescent reporter gene. By calculating the difference in protein expression between a wild-type and a recoded cell, you will quantify the \"leakiness\" of the vacant codon, a concept crucial for quality control and for ensuring the integrity of the newly orthogonal system [@problem_id:2079082].", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team is developing a quality control system to distinguish between a wild-type bacterium and a specially engineered, genomically recoded version of the same bacterium. The recoded strain (REC) has had all 7,659 instances of the TCG codon in its genome replaced with the synonymous AGC codon, and the gene for the tRNA that recognizes TCG has been deleted.\n\nTo create the detection system, the team designed a plasmid containing a gene for a variant of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which we will call *gfp'*. This *gfp'* gene is identical to the wild-type version, except for the introduction of a single TCG codon at a position within the coding sequence. The insertion of this codon, if translated correctly as the amino acid serine, does not affect the protein's ability to fold and fluoresce.\n\nThis plasmid is transformed into two bacterial populations: the wild-type (WT) strain and the recoded (REC) strain. Both cultures are grown under identical conditions, ensuring that the plasmid copy number and the transcription rate of the *gfp'* gene are the same in both strains.\n\nIn the WT strain, the TCG codon is translated into serine with 100% efficiency, producing a functional GFP molecule. In the REC strain, lacking the cognate tRNA, the ribosome stalls at the TCG codon. However, translational read-through can occur with a low efficiency, where a different, near-cognate tRNA incorrectly binds and allows translation to continue, ultimately producing a full-length, functional GFP molecule.\n\nAssume the following:\n- The total fluorescence signal ($F$) measured from a bacterial culture is directly proportional to the total number of functional GFP molecules present.\n- For every one million translation initiation events on the *gfp'* messenger RNA (mRNA) in the REC strain, 350 full-length, functional GFP molecules are produced due to read-through.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total fluorescence from the REC strain culture to the total fluorescence from the WT strain culture, $F_{REC} / F_{WT}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of fluorescence signals, $F_{REC} / F_{WT}$. The fluorescence signal $F$ from a culture is stated to be directly proportional to the total number of functional Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) molecules, $N_{GFP}$. We can write this relationship as $F = k \\cdot N_{GFP}$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe ratio of fluorescence signals can therefore be expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{REC}}{F_{WT}} = \\frac{k \\cdot N_{GFP, REC}}{k \\cdot N_{GFP, WT}} = \\frac{N_{GFP, REC}}{N_{GFP, WT}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{GFP, REC}$ and $N_{GFP, WT}$ are the number of functional GFP molecules in the recoded (REC) and wild-type (WT) strains, respectively.\n\nLet's define $N_{init}$ as the total number of translation initiation events on the *gfp'* messenger RNA (mRNA) in a given period. The problem states that the experimental conditions are identical for both strains, so $N_{init}$ is the same for both WT and REC cultures.\n\nIn the WT strain, the TCG codon is translated with 100% efficiency. This means that every translation initiation event successfully leads to the production of one functional GFP molecule. Therefore, the number of functional GFP molecules in the WT strain is equal to the number of initiation events:\n$$\nN_{GFP, WT} = N_{init} \\cdot 1.0 = N_{init}\n$$\n\nIn the REC strain, a functional GFP molecule is produced only when translational read-through occurs at the TCG codon. The problem provides the efficiency of this process. It states that for every one million ($1 \\times 10^6$) translation initiation events, 350 functional GFP molecules are produced. We can use this to calculate the read-through efficiency, $\\epsilon$.\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{\\text{Number of successful read-through events}}{\\text{Total number of initiation events}} = \\frac{350}{1,000,000} = 350 \\times 10^{-6} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nThis efficiency $\\epsilon$ is the probability that any single translation initiation event will result in a functional protein in the REC strain.\n\nThe total number of functional GFP molecules in the REC strain is the total number of initiation events multiplied by this efficiency:\n$$\nN_{GFP, REC} = N_{init} \\cdot \\epsilon\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the desired ratio by substituting the expressions for $N_{GFP, WT}$ and $N_{GFP, REC}$:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{REC}}{F_{WT}} = \\frac{N_{GFP, REC}}{N_{GFP, WT}} = \\frac{N_{init} \\cdot \\epsilon}{N_{init}}\n$$\nThe term $N_{init}$ cancels out, leaving:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{REC}}{F_{WT}} = \\epsilon\n$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value for $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{REC}}{F_{WT}} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.00035\n$$\nThus, the ratio of the total fluorescence from the REC strain culture to that of the WT strain culture is 0.00035.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00035}$$", "id": "2079082"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of many recoding efforts is to give a newly freed codon a brand-new function, most notably the incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA).
