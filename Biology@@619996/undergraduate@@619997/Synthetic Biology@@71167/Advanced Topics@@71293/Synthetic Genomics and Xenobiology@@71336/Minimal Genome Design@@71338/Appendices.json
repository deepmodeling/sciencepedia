This strain is designed to be incapable of surviving in natural environments, thus preventing accidental release. The starting point is a wild-type bacterium that is prototrophic, meaning it can grow on a minimal medium. This minimal medium consists of glucose as the sole carbon source, ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source, and a buffered solution of essential mineral salts.\n\nTo create the safe chassis, the researchers perform a series of precise genomic deletions, removing all genes responsible for the biosynthetic pathways of all 20 canonical amino acids.

Adding a balanced mixture of purine and pyrimidine bases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, uracil).\n\n", "solution": "We begin with a wild-type prototrophic bacterium that can grow on a minimal medium containing glucose (sole carbon source), ammonium chloride (sole nitrogen source), and mineral salts. Prototrophy implies that, given these inputs, the organism synthesizes all cellular building blocks internally, including all 20 canonical amino acids, nucleotides, and vitamins.\n\nThe engineered modification removes all genes responsible for the biosynthetic pathways of the 20 canonical amino acids, while leaving intact pathways for central carbon metabolism (e.g., glycolysis and the Citric Acid Cycle), nucleotide synthesis, and vitamin/cofactor synthesis. Therefore, the engineered strain becomes auxotrophic for each of the 20 amino acids. In physiological terms, protein synthesis requires charged tRNAs, and tRNA charging requires the corresponding free amino acids; without an exogenous supply of the complete set, translation cannot proceed to build the proteome needed for biomass accumulation and cell division, regardless of the availability of carbon or inorganic nitrogen.\n\nHence, to permit growth, the minimal medium must supply all 20 canonical amino acids exogenously. This is the most essential and direct modification because it targets the exact deficit created by the genomic deletions.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n- A. Supplementing the medium with a complete mixture of all 20 canonical amino acids directly supplies the essential building blocks that the strain can no longer synthesize. This is necessary and sufficient (given that nucleotide and vitamin synthesis remain intact).\n- B. Increasing glucose does not address the inability to synthesize amino acids; more carbon cannot compensate for missing biosynthetic pathways.\n- C. Replacing ammonium chloride with a complex nitrogen source such as yeast extract is not the most direct or minimal change. While yeast extract contains amino acids and peptides, it introduces a complex, undefined mixture beyond what is required; the essential requirement is specifically the amino acids.\n- D. Adding vitamins and cofactors is unnecessary because the strain retains vitamin and cofactor biosynthetic capacity.\n- E. Adding purine and pyrimidine bases is unnecessary because nucleotide synthesis is intact.\n\nTherefore, the most essential and direct modification is the addition of all 20 canonical amino acids to the medium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to practice, the next challenge in minimal genome design is the experimental execution of multiple, precise deletions. This problem puts you in the role of an experimental designer tasked with planning a sequential gene deletion strategy using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. You must consider the practical limitations of the available tools, such as the logistics of using selectable markers and the necessity of plasmid \"curing,\" to devise a robust and successful multi-step workflow.

They have a robust toolkit at their disposal:\n\n1.  A master strain of *B. syntheticus* that has been engineered to stably and constitutively express the Cas9 nuclease from *Streptococcus pyogenes*.\n2.  A standard gRNA delivery plasmid. This plasmid has a temperature-sensitive origin of replication, meaning it replicates normally at a permissive temperature of 30°C but is rapidly lost from the cell population when cultured at a non-permissive temperature of 42°C. The plasmid also carries a single selectable marker gene conferring chloramphenicol resistance.\n3.  The ability to synthesize linear double-stranded DNA fragments to serve as repair templates for the cell's Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) pathway. For each targeted deletion, a corresponding repair template is designed to bridge the gap left by the excised DNA.\n\nThe team's goal is to generate a final strain that has all five regions precisely deleted from its chromosome, without any residual plasmid DNA or extra antibiotic resistance markers. They are considering several different high-level strategies.\n\nGiven the tools available, which of the following proposed strategies represents the most viable and effective approach for achieving the sequential deletion of the five targeted regions?\n\nA. Create five distinct gRNA plasmids, one for each target region, using the same temperature-sensitive plasmid backbone. Sequentially transform the Cas9-expressing strain with the plasmid for Region 1, then Region 2, and so on, selecting for chloramphenicol-resistant colonies at 30°C after each transformation step.\n\nB. Construct a single, complex plasmid that contains five separate expression cassettes, each producing a different gRNA for one of the five target regions. Perform a single transformation of the Cas9-expressing strain with this multiplex plasmid and the five corresponding repair templates, then screen for the rare clones that have successfully deleted all five regions.\n\nC. For each of the five target regions, execute a complete engineering cycle: (i) Co-transform the Cas9-expressing cells with the appropriate gRNA plasmid and its corresponding repair template. (ii) Select for successful transformants on chloramphenicol at 30°C and screen a resulting colony to confirm the chromosomal deletion. (iii) Take the confirmed mutant colony and culture it at 42°C in a medium without chloramphenicol to eliminate the gRNA plasmid. (iv) Use the resulting \"cured\" strain as the starting point for the next deletion cycle.\n\nD. Sequentially transform the Cas9-expressing strain, but alternate between two different selectable markers. For example, use chloramphenicol resistance for deleting Region 1, re-engineer the plasmid backbone to use kanamycin resistance for Region 2, switch back to chloramphenicol for Region 3, and so on.\n\n", "solution": "Goal: sequentially delete five non-essential regions while ending with a chromosome free of plasmid and extra selectable markers. Available tools: a strain constitutively expressing Cas9, a single gRNA delivery plasmid with a temperature-sensitive origin and chloramphenicol resistance, and linear double-stranded DNA repair templates for HDR.\n\nPrinciple 1: Selection logic with a single antibiotic marker. If a cell already carries a plasmid conferring chloramphenicol resistance, plating on chloramphenicol cannot distinguish whether it has acquired a new plasmid that uses the same marker. Thus, to reuse the same selectable marker for a subsequent round, the previous plasmid must be eliminated prior to transformation.\n\nPrinciple 2: Temperature-sensitive origin enables deterministic plasmid curing. Cultivation at a non-permissive temperature (e.g., 42 C) without antibiotic selection causes the loss of the plasmid with a temperature-sensitive origin, enabling reuse of the same selectable marker in subsequent cycles and ensuring that the final strain is plasmid-free.\n\nPrinciple 3: Multiplex DSB burden and probability compounding. If the probability of correctly repairing and deleting a target region per event is $p \\in (0,1)$, the probability of simultaneously achieving five independent deletions in one step is $p^{5}$, which is typically very small. Additionally, introducing $5$ simultaneous double-strand breaks can severely reduce viability, decreasing the effective yield of desired clones.\n\nEvaluate options:\n\nA. Sequentially transforming with five gRNA plasmids using the same marker and selecting on chloramphenicol at 30 C without curing in between is not viable. After the first transformation, cells already resistant to chloramphenicol will grow regardless of uptake of subsequent plasmids, so selection does not enrich for new transformants. Maintaining multiple plasmids with the same origin is unstable, and this strategy does not ensure plasmid elimination, contradicting the final goal.\n\nB. A single multiplex plasmid expressing five gRNAs with co-delivery of five repair templates relies on achieving $5$ correct HDR events in one step, with an expected success on the order of $p^{5}$, where $p$ is the per-deletion success rate. This compounded probability is typically very low, and multiple simultaneous double-strand breaks increase lethality. Although theoretically possible, it is inefficient and impractical relative to a sequential strategy, and plasmid curing would still be required afterward.\n\nC. A cycle of: co-transform gRNA plasmid plus corresponding repair template; select at 30 C on chloramphenicol and confirm the deletion; then cure the plasmid by growth at 42 C without chloramphenicol; and use the cured strain for the next round is directly aligned with Principles 1 and 2. Each round uses selection to enrich for the correct plasmid uptake and editing event, then reliably eliminates the plasmid via the temperature-sensitive origin, restoring the ability to select in the next round with the same marker and ensuring no residual plasmid. Repeating this cycle five times yields the desired genome with no extra markers.\n\nD. Alternating selectable markers is unnecessary and conflicts with the stated toolkit, which provides a single plasmid with chloramphenicol resistance. Even if re-engineered, alternating markers without explicit curing does not solve plasmid accumulation, and adds avoidable cloning burden. The temperature-sensitive curing approach renders marker alternation superfluous.\n\nConclusion: The only strategy that is both operationally robust with the given tools and guarantees a final strain free of plasmid and extra markers is the iterative edit-and-cure workflow in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$"}, {"introduction": "While minimizing a genome can increase efficiency, it often comes at the cost of reduced robustness against environmental stress.

To streamline the genome, they have retained only a single fatty acid desaturase gene, `desA`. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), which is essential for regulating cell membrane fluidity.\n\nThe cell membrane's physical state can be characterized by its phase transition temperature, $T_m$. The membrane is fluid above $T_m$ and enters a non-functional gel state below $T_m$.

The total number of fatty acid molecules in a single cell's membrane, $N_{total}$, is constant.\n\nThe activity of the `desA` enzyme is highly dependent on the ambient temperature, $T$.

At this temperature, the production of MUFAs is balanced by their degradation and dilution due to cell growth. At time $t=0$, a cooling system failure causes an instantaneous drop in the culture's temperature to a lower value, $T_{low}$. For the moments immediately following this temperature shock, you can assume that the rate of MUFA degradation and dilution becomes negligible compared to the enzymatic production rate.\n\nGiven the following parameters, calculate the initial rate of change of the membrane's transition temperature, $\\frac{dT_m}{dt}$, at time $t=0^+$, immediately after the temperature drop.\n- Optimal temperature, $T_{opt} = 310 \\text{ K}$\n- Low temperature, $T_{low} = 290 \\text{ K}$\n- Enzyme temperature sensitivity, $\\sigma = 10 \\text{ K}$\n- SFA membrane transition temperature, $T_{m,S} = 320 \\text{ K}$\n- MUFA membrane transition temperature, $T_{m,U} = 260 \\text{ K}$\n- Maximum enzyme rate, $V_{max} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{ mol/s}$\n- Total fatty acids per cell, $N_{total} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ mol}$\n\nExpress your answer in units of Kelvin per second (K/s).
