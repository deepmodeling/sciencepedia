It refers to the inability of molecular components from one part of a circuit to interact with components from another part. A common failure of orthogonality is \"crosstalk,\" where a signaling molecule unintentionally interacts with a non-target component.\n\nA bioengineer is characterizing a newly designed system composed of two engineered zinc-finger transcription factors, Z-TF1 and Z-TF2, and their cognate promoters, P1 and P2. The design goal is for Z-TF1 to exclusively activate P1 and Z-TF2 to exclusively activate P2. To quantify the orthogonality of Z-TF1, the engineer measures the expression level of a reporter gene downstream of the promoters.\n\nWhen Z-TF1 is expressed in cells containing promoter P1, the reporter gene output is measured to be 2130 arbitrary units (a.u.). This is the intended, or cognate, activation. When Z-TF1 is expressed in cells containing promoter P2, a non-zero reporter output of 98 a.u. is measured. This is the unintended, or non-cognate, activation due to crosstalk.\n\nThe crosstalk of Z-TF1 on promoter P2 is defined as the ratio of the non-cognate activation (Z-TF1 on P2) to the cognate activation (Z-TF1 on P1).\n\nCalculate the crosstalk of Z-TF1 on promoter P2.

This practice explores how this \"switch-like\" behavior, often termed ultrasensitivity, is governed by cooperativity in molecular interactions, a feature mathematically captured by the Hill coefficient, $n$. By comparing two systems, you will quantify how a higher Hill coefficient creates a much sharper and more useful biological device [@problem_id:2053032].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is designing a whole-cell biosensor to detect a toxic environmental pollutant, Compound X. The sensor is based on a genetic circuit in *E. coli* where the production of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is controlled by an orthogonal transcriptional repressor. In the absence of Compound X, the repressor binds to a specific DNA operator site, preventing transcription of the GFP gene. Compound X acts as an inducer: it binds to the repressor, causing it to detach from the DNA and allowing GFP to be produced. The steady-state concentration of GFP, denoted $[GFP]$, as a function of the inducer concentration, $[I]$, is well-described by the following activation model:\n\n$$\n\\frac{[GFP]}{[GFP]_{max}} = \\frac{[I]^n}{K^n + [I]^n}\n$$\n\nHere, $[GFP]_{max}$ is the maximum possible GFP concentration, $K$ is the effective activation constant (the inducer concentration required to achieve half-maximal expression), and $n$ is the Hill coefficient, which describes the cooperativity of the interaction.\n\nThe biologist is choosing between two available orthogonal repressor systems, which are identical in all aspects except for their Hill coefficients.\n- **System A**: Uses a repressor with non-cooperative binding, characterized by a Hill coefficient $n_A = 1$.\n- **System B**: Uses a repressor with strong cooperative binding, characterized by a Hill coefficient $n_B = 4$.\n\nTo quantitatively compare the \"switch-like\" behavior of the two systems, you are tasked with calculating a metric based on the range of inducer concentrations required to transition the system from its \"off\" state to its \"on\" state.

The biosensor consists of a single gene encoding a fluorescent reporter protein. The expression of this gene is regulated by two distinct, orthogonal riboswitches, RS1 and RS2, placed in series within the gene's 5' untranslated region (5' UTR).\n\nThe mechanism of these riboswitches is as follows:\n- RS1 is a theophylline-dependent \"OFF-switch\". In the absence of L1, its structure allows transcription to proceed. In the presence of L1, it binds the metabolite and refolds into a transcriptional terminator, halting transcription.\n- RS2 is a tetracycline-dependent \"OFF-switch\". It operates identically to RS1 but responds exclusively to L2.\n- The term \"orthogonal\" signifies that RS1 does not interact with L2, and RS2 does not interact with L1.\n\nFor the fluorescent reporter protein to be produced, the RNA polymerase must successfully transcribe through both the RS1 and RS2 regions to reach the coding sequence of the gene.

Orthogonality means RS1 responds only to L1 and RS2 responds only to L2, with no cross-interaction.\n\nDefine Boolean variables $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ with $x_{i}=1$ if ligand $L_{i}$ is present and $x_{i}=0$ if $L_{i}$ is absent. Let $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ denote the pass-through condition (transcription permitted) of RS1 and RS2, respectively.
