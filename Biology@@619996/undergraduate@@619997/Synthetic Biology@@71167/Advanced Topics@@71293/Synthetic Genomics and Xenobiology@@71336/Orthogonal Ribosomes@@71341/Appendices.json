This is mediated by the interaction between a specific nucleotide sequence on the mRNA, known as the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, and a complementary sequence at the 3' end of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), called the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (aSD) sequence.\n\nSynthetic biologists often engineer \"orthogonal\" ribosome-mRNA pairs to control the expression of specific genes independently of the host cell's native machinery. This is achieved by creating a unique, non-native SD/aSD pair. An engineered orthogonal ribosome will only translate mRNAs containing the corresponding orthogonal SD sequence, and vice versa.\n\nSuppose a researcher has successfully constructed an orthogonal ribosome whose 16S rRNA contains the 5-nucleotide orthogonal anti-Shine-Dalgarno (o-aSD) sequence $5'\\text{-ACCUA-}3'$.

This system consists of an engineered orthogonal ribosome (o-ribosome) and a corresponding orthogonal messenger RNA (o-mRNA). The o-mRNA is designed to be translated exclusively by the o-ribosome, and the o-ribosome is designed to avoid translating the host cell's native mRNAs.\n\nTo quantify the performance of their system, the group conducts a series of experiments using fluorescent reporter proteins. The o-mRNA is engineered to encode Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). A native gene that produces Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) is constitutively expressed and used as a reporter for the translation of endogenous mRNA. Fluorescence is measured in arbitrary units (a.u.).\n\nThe experiments yield the following data:\n1.  In a strain containing both the o-ribosome and the o-mRNA-GFP plasmid, the total measured green fluorescence is $F_{GFP,total} = 850.0$ a.u.\n2.

This corresponds to the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) produced specifically by the o-ribosome translating the o-mRNA. We can determine this value by subtracting the leaky GFP fluorescence (produced by native ribosomes) from the total GFP fluorescence measured in the full system.\nLet $F_{GFP,ortho}$ be the desired orthogonal GFP fluorescence.\n$$F_{GFP,ortho} = F_{GFP,total} - F_{GFP,leak}$$\nUsing the values provided in the problem statement:\n$$F_{GFP,ortho} = 850.0 \\text{ a.u.} - 45.0 \\text{ a.u.} = 805.0 \\text{ a.u.}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the total undesired off-target fluorescence, which is the sum of leakiness and crosstalk.\n\nThe fluorescence from leaky translation is explicitly given from the second experiment:\n$$F_{leak} = F_{GFP,leak} = 45.0 \\text{ a.u.}$$\n\nThe fluorescence from crosstalk translation corresponds to the amount of Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) produced by the o-ribosome incorrectly translating a native mRNA.
