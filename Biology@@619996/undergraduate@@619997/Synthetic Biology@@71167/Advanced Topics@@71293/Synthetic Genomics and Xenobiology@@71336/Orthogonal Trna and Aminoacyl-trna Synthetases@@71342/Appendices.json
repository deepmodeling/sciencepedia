This first practice challenges you to construct the genetic blueprint for an orthogonal translation system [@problem_id:2053848]. Success hinges on understanding the core differences in expressing a protein (the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase) versus a functional RNA (the transfer RNA), requiring you to correctly apply your knowledge of promoters, ribosome binding sites, and terminators.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is designing a system to incorporate a non-canonical amino acid into a target protein expressed in *Escherichia coli*. This requires the co-expression of an orthogonal pair: a unique aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) that charges the non-canonical amino acid, and its corresponding orthogonal transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA). Both genes are to be placed on a single plasmid for stable maintenance and expression in the bacterial host. The plasmid backbone already contains a necessary origin of replication (`ori`) and an antibiotic resistance marker.\n\nYou are provided with the following genetic parts to construct the expression cassettes:\n*   `P_const`: A strong, constitutive bacterial promoter that initiates transcription.\n*   `RBS`: A ribosome binding site, required for initiating translation in prokaryotes.\n*   `CDS_aaRS`: The protein-coding sequence for the orthogonal aaRS.\n*   `Gene_tRNA`: The gene sequence that is transcribed into the functional orthogonal tRNA.\n*   `T`: A rho-independent transcriptional terminator.\n\nAssuming the most standard and efficient design for robust expression of both components, which of the following linear arrangements correctly represents the genetic cassettes required on the plasmid? The notation `[A -> B -> C]` indicates that part A is placed immediately upstream of part B, which is upstream of part C.\n\nA.

Single Operon: `[P_const -> RBS -> CDS_aaRS -> Gene_tRNA -> T]`", "solution": "To design robust expression of both an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and its orthogonal tRNA in bacteria, we apply the following standard principles of prokaryotic gene expression. A protein-coding gene requires a transcriptional promoter to recruit RNA polymerase, a ribosome binding site (RBS) to recruit the ribosome for translation initiation, the coding sequence, and a transcriptional terminator to ensure proper termination; the canonical architecture is therefore promoter followed by RBS, coding sequence, and terminator. In contrast, a tRNA is a non-coding RNA that is transcribed but not translated; it therefore requires a promoter and terminator for transcription, but it must not include an RBS because an RBS is only used for translation of mRNA into protein and is inappropriate for tRNA expression. For robust and modular control, the aaRS and tRNA are typically placed in separate expression cassettes on the same plasmid, each with its own promoter and terminator.\n\nEvaluate each option against these rules. Option A places an RBS upstream of the tRNA gene, which is incorrect because tRNA is not translated and does not require or use an RBS; including an RBS is unnecessary and non-standard. Option B provides the aaRS cassette as promoter, RBS, coding sequence, and terminator, and provides the tRNA cassette as promoter, tRNA gene, and terminator; this matches the standard and efficient design for expressing a protein-coding gene and a non-coding tRNA gene in bacteria. Option C omits the RBS for the aaRS, which would prevent efficient translation initiation of the aaRS and is therefore incorrect. Option D lacks a promoter for the tRNA gene, which would prevent transcription of the tRNA and is therefore incorrect. Option E places both elements in a single operon with one promoter and one RBS upstream of the aaRS, directly followed by the tRNA gene and a single terminator. This is non-standard for reliable tRNA expression because the tRNA should be transcribed as a functional RNA with its own promoter and processing context, not embedded downstream of a protein-coding sequence in a polycistronic mRNA architecture lacking a dedicated tRNA promoter; such an arrangement risks improper transcriptional control and RNA processing for the tRNA.\n\nTherefore, the correct and most standard arrangement is separate cassettes with promoter-RBS-coding-terminator for the aaRS and promoter-gene-terminator for the tRNA, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2053848"}, {"introduction": "With a design in hand, the next critical step is experimental verification. This exercise simulates a common method for testing an orthogonal system's function using a reporter protein [@problem_id:2053821]. By predicting the results of a protein gel electrophoresis experiment under different conditions, you will learn to think critically about experimental controls and how to interpret biochemical data to confirm stop codon suppression.", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team is working on expanding the genetic code of *E. coli*. Their goal is to incorporate a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) in response to the UAG amber stop codon. To do this, they use an orthogonal system composed of an engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (`aaRS_o`) and its cognate transfer RNA (`tRNA_o`). The `aaRS_o` specifically charges the `tRNA_o` with the ncAA, and the `tRNA_o` has an anticodon that recognizes the UAG codon.\n\nTo test their system, they use a reporter gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The wild-type GFP protein has a molecular weight of approximately 27 kDa. They create a mutant version of the gene, `GFP-UAG`, where a tyrosine codon in the middle of the coding sequence has been replaced by a UAG stop codon. If translation terminates at this premature stop codon, the resulting truncated protein fragment has a molecular weight of 15 kDa.\n\nThe team sets up four different experimental conditions, transforming *E. coli* with different combinations of plasmids and growing them in specific media. After inducing protein expression, they lyse the cells and analyze the protein content from each culture using Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate - Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a technique that separates proteins based on their molecular weight.\n\nThe four conditions are as follows:\n- **Condition A:** Cells contain a plasmid for expressing the `GFP-UAG` gene only.\n- **Condition B:** Cells contain a plasmid for `GFP-UAG` and a second plasmid for the orthogonal system (`aaRS_o` and `tRNA_o`). These cells are grown in media supplemented with the ncAA.\n- **Condition C:** Cells contain a plasmid for `GFP-UAG` and a second plasmid for the orthogonal system (`aaRS_o` and `tRNA_o`). These cells are grown in media that *lacks* the ncAA.\n- **Condition D:** Cells contain a plasmid for expressing the wild-type `GFP` gene (with no UAG mutation). This serves as a positive control.\n\nAssuming the orthogonal system is 100% efficient and there are no read-through events by native tRNAs, which condition(s) will result in a distinct band on the SDS-PAGE gel corresponding to the full-length protein of ~27 kDa?\n\nA.

A, B, C, and D", "solution": "We interpret the system using the stated assumptions: the orthogonal pair suppresses the UAG stop codon only when the orthogonal tRNA is charged with the non-canonical amino acid, and this suppression is perfectly efficient when enabled. The condition of no read-through by native tRNAs implies that without suppression, translation at UAG terminates, yielding the truncated product.\n\nFor Condition A, only the GFP-UAG gene is present. There is no orthogonal aaRS or tRNA. With no suppressor tRNA and no read-through, the UAG codon is recognized by release factors, translation terminates at the premature stop, and only the truncated protein of approximately 15 kDa is produced. Therefore, no band at approximately 27 kDa appears.\n\nFor Condition B, the GFP-UAG gene and the orthogonal aaRS and tRNA are present, and the medium contains the non-canonical amino acid. The orthogonal aaRS charges the orthogonal tRNA with the ncAA, and with the given assumption of 100 percent efficiency, the UAG codon is always suppressed. Translation proceeds to completion, producing full-length GFP of approximately 27 kDa. Therefore, a distinct band at approximately 27 kDa is observed.\n\nFor Condition C, the GFP-UAG gene and the orthogonal aaRS and tRNA are present, but the medium lacks the ncAA. The orthogonal aaRS cannot charge the orthogonal tRNA in the absence of substrate, so suppression cannot occur. With no read-through, translation terminates at UAG, producing only the truncated 15 kDa fragment. Therefore, no band at approximately 27 kDa appears.\n\nFor Condition D, the wild-type GFP gene has no UAG interruption. Translation proceeds to the natural stop codon, producing full-length GFP of approximately 27 kDa. Therefore, a band at approximately 27 kDa is observed.\n\nCombining these results, the conditions yielding a distinct band at approximately 27 kDa are Condition B and Condition D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2053821"}, {"introduction": "While reporter assays suggest functionality, definitive proof requires more precise tools.

They are using an orthogonal translation system (OTS), which consists of a unique aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and its cognate transfer RNA (tRNA). This OTS is engineered to uniquely recognize the amber stop codon, UAG (transcribed from a TAG codon in the DNA), and charge the orthogonal tRNA with pAzF.\n\nThe wild-type protein contains the amino acid sequence fragment `-Lys-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Arg-`. The researchers have mutated the gene encoding this protein to replace the codon for Tyrosine (Tyr) with the amber stop codon TAG, resulting in a mutant gene sequence that encodes for `-Lys-Ala-(TAG)-Gly-Arg-`.\n\nTwo separate experiments are conducted:\n1.  **Wild-Type Control:** The unmodified, wild-type gene is expressed in host cells.\n2.  **ncAA Experiment:** The mutated gene is expressed in host cells that also contain the pAzF-specific OTS, and the growth medium is supplemented with pAzF.\n\nAfter expression, the target protein from both experiments is purified, digested with the enzyme trypsin (which cleaves the peptide chain on the C-terminal side of Lysine (K) and Arginine (R) residues), and the resulting peptide fragments are analyzed by mass spectrometry.\n\nFor your analysis, use the following integer-rounded residue masses (the mass of the amino acid once it is part of a peptide chain):\n- Alanine (Ala): 71 Da\n- Glycine (Gly): 57 Da\n- Tyrosine (Tyr): 163 Da\n- p-azidophenylalanine (pAzF): 189 Da\n\nWhich of the following outcomes would provide definitive proof that the site-specific incorporation of pAzF was successful?\n\nA.

This matches the precise, site-localized tryptic fragment mass shift of 26 Da, demonstrating specific replacement of Tyr with pAzF at the engineered site. This is definitive proof.\n- B: A 26 Da increase in the intact protein mass does not localize the modification to the intended site; it is not definitive for site-specific incorporation.\n- C: Peaks at both 291 Da and 317 Da indicate a mixed population (incomplete or heterogeneous incorporation), not definitive proof of exclusive site-specific pAzF incorporation.\n- D: Presence of 291 Da and a truncated fragment indicates termination at the amber codon, not successful incorporation of pAzF.\n- E: Only 291 Da in both samples indicates no incorporation of pAzF.\n\nTherefore, only option A provides definitive proof of successful site-specific incorporation of pAzF at the targeted site.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2053849"}]}
