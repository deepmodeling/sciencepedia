Since current technology cannot synthesize an entire chromosome at once, it must be built from smaller DNA fragments.

This requires assembling a large synthetic Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) construct and inserting it into the yeast's genome. The total length of the target DNA sequence to be assembled is 15 kilobases (kb).\n\nThe team plans to use a one-pot assembly method, such as Gibson Assembly, where all DNA fragments are mixed together and join simultaneously. The commercial DNA synthesis provider can produce linear DNA fragments up to a maximum length of 1.5 kb. For the assembly to be successful, any two adjacent fragments must share a common sequence, or overlap region, of exactly 40 base pairs (bp).\n\nTo construct the full 15 kb sequence, fragments are designed to tile across the target sequence. The first fragment covers the beginning of the sequence. The second fragment starts 40 bp before the end of the first fragment's sequence coverage, and so on for all subsequent fragments. To minimize costs, the team wants to use the minimum number of synthesized DNA fragments possible.\n\nGiven these constraints, determine the absolute minimum number of individual DNA fragments that need to be synthesized to create the complete 15 kb target sequence.\n\n(Note: 1 kb = 1000 bp)", "solution": "Convert the target length to base pairs: $15\\,\\text{kb} = 15000\\,\\text{bp}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of fragments, and let the length of fragment $i$ be $L_{i}$ with $0 < L_{i} \\leq 1500$ for all $i$. With an exact $40\\,\\text{bp}$ overlap between each adjacent pair, the assembled length $L_{\\text{assembled}}$ from $N$ fragments is\n$$\nL_{\\text{assembled}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}L_{i}-40(N-1).\n$$\nTo minimize $N$, maximize fragment lengths subject to the $1500\\,\\text{bp}$ limit. The maximum assembled length achievable with $N$ fragments is obtained by setting $L_{i}=1500$ for all $i$, giving\n$$\nL_{\\text{max}}(N)=1500N-40(N-1)=1460N+40.\n$$\nWe require $L_{\\text{max}}(N)\\geq 15000$ so that suitable choices of $L_{i}\\leq 1500$ can reach $15000\\,\\text{bp}$ exactly. Solve\n$$\n1460N+40\\geq 15000 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; 1460N\\geq 14960 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; N\\geq \\frac{14960}{1460}=\\frac{748}{73}.\n$$\nThus the minimal integer is $N=11$.\n\nTo verify feasibility and minimality, choose $L_{1}=\\cdots=L_{10}=1500$ and solve for $L_{11}$ from\n$$\n15000=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{11}L_{i}\\right)-40\\cdot 10= \\left(1500\\cdot 10+L_{11}\\right)-400=14600+L_{11},\n$$\nwhich yields\n$$\nL_{11}=15000-14600=400 \\leq 1500.\n$$\nHence $N=11$ is feasible. For $N=10$, the required eleventh-fragment analogue would be $L_{10}=15000-1460\\cdot 9=1860>1500$, which is infeasible. Therefore, the absolute minimum number of fragments is $11$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11}$$", "id": "2071478"}, {"introduction": "Once a synthetic chromosome is built and delivered to a cell, how do we confirm the replacement was successful? This problem puts you in the role of an experimentalist in the \"Test\" phase, asking you to interpret data from a fundamental molecular biology technique used to separate entire chromosomes. You will see how a deliberate design choice—making the synthetic chromosome a different size—enables clear verification [@problem_id:2071480].", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is working on the Synthetic Yeast Genome Project (Sc2.0), which aims to build the world's first synthetic eukaryotic genome from scratch. Their current task is to replace the native chromosome V of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* with its corresponding synthetic version, `synV`.\n\nThe `synV` chromosome was designed to be fundamentally different from its native counterpart. While largely preserving the essential gene content, the designers incorporated hundreds of loxPsym sites, which are specific DNA sequences recognized by the Cre recombinase enzyme. These sites are intended for a future genome scrambling system. The addition of these numerous, non-coding sequences makes the synthetic `synV` chromosome approximately 5% shorter than the native chromosome V.\n\nAfter transforming yeast cells with the synthetic `synV` DNA and using a selection marker to identify colonies that have potentially undergone the replacement, a researcher isolates one promising candidate strain. To verify whether the native chromosome V has been successfully and completely replaced by `synV`, the researcher extracts intact chromosomes from the candidate strain and analyzes them using Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), a technique that separates very large DNA molecules.\n\nWhich of the following statements describes the primary and most direct information the researcher seeks to obtain by performing this PFGE analysis?\n\nA.

In a yeast karyotype PFGE, each chromosome typically appears as a discrete band whose position reflects its length.

Therefore, complete replacement of the native chromosome V by `synV` would be evidenced by the disappearance of the band at the native chromosome V position and the appearance of a new band that migrates slightly faster, consistent with the smaller size.\n\nPFGE does not provide base-level sequence verification, so it cannot confirm exact sequence identity (eliminating A). It does not measure transcript or protein levels, so it cannot assess expression of essential genes (eliminating B). It does not assay enzymatic activity of Cre or its recombination outcomes directly (eliminating C). It also cannot resolve the precise number or genomic locations of loxPsym sites (eliminating E).

As a milestone, they have successfully replaced the native chromosome III with its synthesized counterpart, `synIII`. The initial \"test\" phase reveals a significant problem: the engineered yeast strain exhibits a markedly slower growth rate compared to the wild-type strain. The `synIII` was designed with numerous modifications, including the removal of all introns and the relocation of all transfer RNA (tRNA) genes to a dedicated \"tRNA neochromosome.\" Additionally, a system called SCRaMbLE (Synthetic Chromosome Recombination and Modification by LoxP-mediated Evolution) was embedded throughout `synIII`. This system can be activated to induce a high rate of random deletions and rearrangements specifically within the synthetic chromosome.\n\nThe team's goal is to debug `synIII` to identify the genetic element(s) causing the slow-growth phenotype and restore the strain's fitness. According to the principles of the \"Design-Build-Test\" cycle central to engineering and synthetic biology, which of the following strategies represents the most logical and efficient next step?\n\nA.

The ideal approach is targeted to the engineered component (`synIII`), high-throughput, selection-based for the desired phenotype (faster growth), and immediately yields causal genomic hypotheses.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A leverages the embedded SCRaMbLE system, which is specifically designed to induce targeted, high-diversity rearrangements (deletions/inversions/duplications/translocations) within the synthetic chromosome using site-specific recombination at designed sites. Activating SCRaMbLE in a large population, then selecting for fast-growing colonies, directly couples genotype-to-phenotype through selection. Sequencing `synIII` from independent “winner” isolates and identifying recurrently altered regions pinpoints the deleterious design element(s). This is efficient, focused on `synIII`, and maximizes information gain per iteration, tightly matching the Test-to-Design feedback loop.\n- Option B discards the current design without extracting learning. It is inefficient, abandons hard-won Build/Test information, and restarts the cycle prematurely.\n- Option C (global proteomics) yields correlative expression differences but does not directly identify which `synIII` design change is causal. Many differences may reflect downstream effects; mapping back to specific `synIII` elements would remain indirect and time-consuming, with lower efficiency in closing the loop.\n- Option D (whole-genome resequencing of slow growers) is a quality-control step to rule out off-target mutations but does not by itself identify which `synIII` features cause slow growth. It can be complementary, but it does not efficiently achieve the primary goal of debugging `synIII`’s design.\n- Option E (one-by-one reversion of hundreds of edits) is a brute-force, low-throughput approach that is impractically slow and inefficient relative to SCRaMbLE-based selection and convergence analysis.\n\nConclusion:\nOption A is the most logical and efficient next step aligned with the Design-Build-Test cycle: induce diversity specifically in `synIII`, select for improved growth, and read out convergent genetic changes to identify and correct the causative design flaws.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2071455"}]}
