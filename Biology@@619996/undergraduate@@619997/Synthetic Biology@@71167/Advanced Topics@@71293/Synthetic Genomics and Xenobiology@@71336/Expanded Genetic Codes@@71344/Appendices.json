Their goal is to evolve a tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from the archaeon *Methanocaldococcus jannaschii* (MjTyrRS) to charge the UAA *p*-azido-L-phenylalanine (pAzF) instead of its natural substrate, tyrosine.\n\nThe researchers use a directed evolution strategy. First, they create a large library of MjTyrRS gene variants. This library is then transformed into a specialized *E. coli* strain. This host strain is engineered to express an orthogonal tRNA (tRNA_CUA), which is the cognate partner for MjTyrRS, and a reporter gene for chloramphenicol resistance. Crucially, the chloramphenicol resistance gene has been modified to contain an in-frame amber stop codon (UAG) at a position that is essential for the protein's function.\n\nFor the selection step, the transformed *E. coli* cells are plated on a solid growth medium that contains both the antibiotic chloramphenicol and the unnatural amino acid pAzF. Only a small fraction of the transformed cells are observed to grow into colonies.\n\nWhat is the primary purpose of this selection step in the experiment?\n\nA. To identify and isolate MjTyrRS variants that successfully charge pAzF onto the tRNA_CUA, thereby enabling the synthesis of a full-length, functional chloramphenicol resistance protein.\n\nB. To eliminate MjTyrRS variants that incorrectly charge one of the 20 canonical amino acids onto the tRNA_CUA, which would lead to the synthesis of a misfolded and non-functional protein.\n\nC. To create a diverse population of MjTyrRS mutants by introducing random mutations into the synthetase gene.\n\nD. To confirm that the orthogonal tRNA_CUA is not recognized by any of the endogenous *E. coli* aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.\n\nE. To precisely quantify the enzymatic activity of each MjTyrRS variant towards the unnatural amino acid pAzF.", "solution": "The experimental logic relies on amber suppression using an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. The host cell contains:\n- An orthogonal tRNA with anticodon CUA that can decode the amber codon UAG only if it is aminoacylated.\n- A reporter gene for chloramphenicol resistance containing an in-frame UAG at an essential position; without suppression, translation terminates prematurely and the protein is nonfunctional, so cells cannot grow in chloramphenicol.\n- A library of MjTyrRS variants intended to charge the orthogonal tRNA with the unnatural amino acid p-azido-L-phenylalanine (pAzF).\n\nOn plates containing chloramphenicol and pAzF, survival requires successful amber suppression at the essential UAG site. This occurs if and only if an MjTyrRS variant specifically recognizes pAzF and charges it onto the orthogonal tRNA, enabling insertion of pAzF at UAG and synthesis of the full-length, functional chloramphenicol resistance protein. Most variants do not accomplish this and the corresponding cells fail to grow.\n\nTherefore, the primary purpose of the selection is positive selection for aaRS variants that efficiently aminoacylate the orthogonal tRNA with pAzF to restore reporter function. Evaluating the options:\n- A correctly describes this positive selection outcome.\n- B pertains to negative selection against mischarging with canonical amino acids, which would typically require a different selective setup (e.g., a toxic gene under amber control) and is not the primary purpose of plating on chloramphenicol plus pAzF.\n- C describes library creation, which occurs before the selection step.\n- D concerns orthogonality validation, which is not the function of this selection plate.\n- E implies precise quantitation of enzymatic activity, whereas this selection is qualitative/threshold-based (growth vs. no growth), not a precise kinetic assay.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2037019"}, {"introduction": "Once a functional orthogonal translation system is established, the next critical question is one of efficiency. The production of a full-length protein containing ncAAs is not guaranteed, as the engineered machinery must compete with the cell's natural processes, particularly translation termination. This problem [@problem_id:2037028] challenges you to build a simple kinetic model that quantifies this competition, allowing you to predict the fractional yield of your desired protein. This type of modeling is essential for optimizing ncAA incorporation and understanding the fundamental limitations of the system, especially when incorporating multiple ncAAs into a single protein.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is developing a process to produce a therapeutic Protein of Interest (POI) that has been engineered to contain a Non-Canonical Amino acid (ncAA). The genetic code is expanded using an orthogonal translation system that reassigns the amber stop codon (UAG, written as TAG in the corresponding DNA sequence) to the ncAA.\n\nThe system's overall efficiency is limited by competition at the ribosome. When a UAG codon enters the ribosomal A-site, the correctly charged orthogonal tRNA ($tRNA^{ncAA}$) must compete with Release Factor 1 (RF1), which would otherwise bind to the codon and terminate translation.\n\nThe probability of successful ncAA incorporation at a single UAG codon is determined by the relative rates of binding of these two molecules. The effective rate of incorporation can be modeled as $R_{inc} = k_{inc}[tRNA^{ncAA}]$, and the effective rate of termination as $R_{term} = k_{term}[RF1]$. Here, $k_{inc}$ and $k_{term}$ are the respective second-order rate constants, while $[tRNA^{ncAA}]$ and $[RF1]$ are the intracellular concentrations of the charged orthogonal tRNA and Release Factor 1.\n\nThe gene encoding the POI has been engineered to contain $N$ separate TAG codons. Assume that translation initiation occurs successfully for all messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and that the incorporation events at each of the $N$ TAG codons are independent and have an identical probability of success. Any failure to incorporate the ncAA at any of the $N$ sites results in a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the fractional yield ($Y$) of the full-length POI. The yield is defined as the fraction of initiated translations that result in a complete, full-length protein. Express your answer in terms of $N$, $k_{inc}$, $k_{term}$, $[tRNA^{ncAA}]$, and $[RF1]$.", "solution": "For a single UAG codon in the ribosomal A-site, there are two competing, mutually exclusive events: ncAA incorporation with effective rate $R_{inc}$ and termination with effective rate $R_{term}$. For competing memoryless processes, the probability that incorporation occurs before termination is given by the ratio of its rate to the sum of the competing rates:\n$$\np \\equiv P(\\text{incorporation at one UAG}) = \\frac{R_{inc}}{R_{inc} + R_{term}}.\n$$\nUsing the given effective rates $R_{inc} = k_{inc}[tRNA^{ncAA}]$ and $R_{term} = k_{term}[RF1]$, this becomes\n$$\np = \\frac{k_{inc}[tRNA^{ncAA}]}{k_{inc}[tRNA^{ncAA}] + k_{term}[RF1]}.\n$$\nThe gene contains $N$ independent TAG codons with identical incorporation probability $p$ at each site, and any failure yields a truncated protein.
