A common application is the creation of microbial biosensors that respond to specific environmental cues.\n\nImagine you are tasked with designing a bacterial biosensor that produces a fluorescent signal only under a specific combination of conditions: it must detect the presence of an industrial pollutant (Molecule A) but remain inactive if a common nutrient (Molecule B) is also present in the environment. This prevents the cell from expending energy on fluorescence when it is actively growing. The desired output is the expression of a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), which makes the cell glow red.\n\nYour available genetic parts are:\n1.  The gene for RFP.\n2.  A gene coding for an `A-responsive activator`: a protein that functions as a transcriptional activator only when bound to Molecule A.\n3.  A gene coding for a `B-responsive repressor`: a protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor only when bound to Molecule B.\n4.  Various promoters that can be placed upstream of a gene to control its expression.\n\nThe behavior of the biosensor can be described by the logic function `(Presence of A) AND (Absence of B)`. Which of the following descriptions accurately represents the design of the genetic circuit that controls the RFP gene to achieve this specific logical behavior?\n\nA. The `RFP` gene is placed under the control of a single promoter that is positively regulated by the `A-responsive activator` and negatively regulated by the `B-responsive repressor`.\n\nB. The `RFP` gene is placed under the control of a single promoter that requires two distinct activator proteins for transcription: the `A-responsive activator` and a second, `B-responsive activator`.\n\nC. The `RFP` gene is placed under the control of a constitutive promoter (a promoter that is always active by default) that is repressed by two distinct repressor proteins: an `A-responsive repressor` and the `B-responsive repressor`.\n\nD. The `RFP` gene is placed under the control of a promoter that is solely activated by the `A-responsive activator`, with no regulatory elements responsive to Molecule B.\n\nE. The `RFP` gene is placed under the control of a constitutive promoter that is solely repressed by the `B-responsive repressor`, with no regulatory elements responsive to Molecule A.", "solution": "We formalize the desired behavior as the Boolean function $F = A \\land \\lnot B$, where $A$ denotes the presence of Molecule A and $B$ denotes the presence of Molecule B. The output $F$ should be $1$ (RFP expressed) only when $A=1$ and $B=0$.\n\nWe map genetic regulation to logic:\n- An A-responsive activator is active only when $A=1$; it provides positive regulation that enables transcription when bound.\n- A B-responsive repressor is active only when $B=1$; it provides negative regulation that blocks transcription when bound.\n\nFor a promoter controlled by both an activator and a repressor, transcription is expected only when activation is present and repression is absent. Enumerating cases for a promoter that is positively regulated by the A-responsive activator and negatively regulated by the B-responsive repressor:\n- If $A=0$, $B=0$: no activator is present, so transcription does not initiate; output $0$.\n- If $A=1$, $B=0$: activator is present and repressor absent; transcription proceeds; output $1$.\n- If $A=0$, $B=1$: repressor is present and no activator; transcription is blocked; output $0$.\n- If $A=1$, $B=1$: repressor is present and blocks transcription despite activation; output $0$.\nThis truth pattern matches $A \\land \\lnot B$.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- Option A places RFP under a promoter positively regulated by the A-responsive activator and negatively regulated by the B-responsive repressor. As shown above, this yields $A \\land \\lnot B$, which matches the desired logic.\n- Option B requires two activators (A-responsive and B-responsive); this implements $A \\land B$, not $A \\land \\lnot B$.\n- Option C uses repressors responsive to both A and B on a constitutive promoter; expression occurs only when neither repressor is active, i.e., $\\lnot A \\land \\lnot B$, not the target function.\n- Option D uses only A-dependent activation; this yields $A$, independent of $B$, not the target function.\n- Option E uses only B-dependent repression on a constitutive promoter; this yields $\\lnot B$, independent of $A$, not the target function.\n\nTherefore, the correct design is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2047013"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the initial design, understanding a circuit's performance is crucial for its practical application. This problem delves into the concept of a \"switching threshold,\" a key metric that defines a biosensor's sensitivity. You will explore how a fundamental molecular property, the binding affinity ($K_d$) of a repressor protein, directly influences the overall system-level behavior of a two-repressor cascade [@problem_id:2046991].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is constructing a genetic circuit in *E. coli* to act as a biosensor. The circuit is a two-repressor cascade designed to produce a fluorescent signal in response to a specific input molecule.\n\nThe circuit operates as follows:\n1.  An input signaling molecule, acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), is added to the bacterial culture. It passively enters the cells and induces the expression of the tetracycline repressor protein (TetR). The steady-state concentration of active TetR inside the cell is directly proportional to the external concentration of AHL.\n2.  The TetR protein acts as a repressor, binding to an operator site that controls the expression of the lactose repressor protein (LacI). Thus, higher concentrations of TetR lead to lower concentrations of LacI.\n3.  The LacI protein, in turn, represses the expression of a reporter gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).\n\nThe \"switching threshold\" of this biosensor is defined as the external concentration of AHL required to make the steady-state GFP fluorescence reach exactly half of its maximum possible level.\n\nAfter characterizing the initial circuit, the biologist modifies it by replacing the gene for the wild-type LacI protein with a gene for an engineered variant, LacI*. This LacI* variant is known to have a much higher binding affinity for its target operator sequence on the DNA. A higher binding affinity corresponds to a lower dissociation constant ($K_d$). All other parts of the circuit, including the promoters and the TetR protein, remain identical.\n\nHow does this modification affect the switching threshold of the biosensor?\n\nA. The switching threshold will decrease, making the circuit more sensitive to AHL.\n\nB. The switching threshold will increase, making the circuit less sensitive to AHL.\n\nC. The switching threshold will remain anchanged, because the modification only affects the properties of the second repressor.\n\nD. The modification will cause the GFP output to be permanently ON at its maximum level, regardless of the AHL concentration.\n\nE. The modification will cause the GFP output to be permanently OFF, regardless of the AHL concentration.", "solution": "Let $S$ denote the external AHL concentration, $T$ the intracellular TetR concentration, $L$ the LacI (or LacI$^{*}$) concentration, and $G$ the GFP level at steady state.\n\nBy the statement, TetR is directly proportional to AHL, so we write\n$$\nT(S) = \\alpha S,\n$$\nwith $\\alpha>0$ a proportionality constant.\n\nTetR represses LacI; a standard Hill repression form gives a strictly decreasing function of $T$:\n$$\nL(T) = \\frac{L_{\\max}}{1+\\left(\\frac{T}{K_{T}}\\right)^{n_{T}}},\n$$\nwith $L_{\\max}>0$, $K_{T}>0$, and $n_{T}\\geq 1$.\n\nLacI represses GFP; likewise,\n$$\nG(L) = \\frac{G_{\\max}}{1+\\left(\\frac{L}{K_{L}}\\right)^{n_{L}}},\n$$\nwith $G_{\\max}>0$, $K_{L}>0$, and $n_{L}\\geq 1$. The composite input-output map is $G(S)=G(L(T(S)))$, which is strictly increasing in $S$ because $T$ increases with $S$, $L$ decreases with $T$, and $G$ decreases with $L$.\n\nThe switching threshold $S_{1/2}$ is defined by $G(S_{1/2})=\\frac{G_{\\max}}{2}$. Solving this condition in terms of $L$,\n$$\n\\frac{G_{\\max}}{1+\\left(\\frac{L}{K_{L}}\\right)^{n_{L}}}=\\frac{G_{\\max}}{2}\n\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\n1+\\left(\\frac{L}{K_{L}}\\right)^{n_{L}}=2\n\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\n\\left(\\frac{L}{K_{L}}\\right)^{n_{L}}=1\n\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\nL=K_{L}.\n$$\nThus the half-maximum GFP occurs precisely when the LacI concentration equals its dissociation constant for the GFP promoter.\n\nTherefore, the threshold $S_{1/2}$ is the unique solution of\n$$\nL(T(S_{1/2}))=K_{L}.\n$$\n\nAfter replacing LacI by LacI$^{*}$ with higher binding affinity, its dissociation constant decreases: $K_{L}^{*}<K_{L}$. The new threshold $S_{1/2}^{*}$ satisfies\n$$\nL(T(S_{1/2}^{*}))=K_{L}^{*}.\n$$\nSince $L(T(S))$ is strictly decreasing in $S$, a smaller target on the right-hand side requires a larger $S$ to satisfy the equality. Hence\n$$\nS_{1/2}^{*}>S_{1/2}.\n$$\nThus the switching threshold increases, making the circuit less sensitive to AHL.\n\nFinally, the modification cannot make GFP permanently ON (option D) because at low $S$ the cascade yields high $L$, which represses $G$. Nor can it make GFP permanently OFF (option E) because at sufficiently high $S$, $T$ becomes large, $L$ is driven low, and $G$ approaches $G_{\\max}$. The dependence on $S$ remains monotonic, with an increased threshold.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2046991"}, {"introduction": "Engineered biological systems, like any complex machine, can experience component failures.

The presence of specific inducer molecules serves as the inputs ('1' state), and their absence as the '0' state. The output is the expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), where high fluorescence is a '1' state and no fluorescence is a '0' state.\n\nThe circuit is constructed as follows:\n1.  A hybrid promoter, P_hybrid, drives the expression of the LacI repressor protein. This promoter is only activated when **two distinct** activator proteins, ActA and ActB, are simultaneously present.\n2.  The expression of ActA is regulated by the input molecule anhydrotetracycline (aTc). A promoter, P_tet, drives the expression of a small RNA (sRNA) that inhibits the translation of the ActA messenger RNA (mRNA). P_tet itself is repressed by the TetR protein. The inducer aTc inactivates TetR.\n3.  The expression of ActB is regulated in an analogous manner by the input molecule isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), using a separate and independent sRNA system. The presence of IPTG leads to the production of ActB.\n4.  The LacI repressor, produced from the P_hybrid promoter, binds to and strongly represses a final promoter, P_out, which drives the expression of GFP.\n\nDuring routine sequencing, a mutant strain is discovered. In this mutant, the P_tet promoter has been completely deleted, but all other components of the circuit, including the gene for the sRNA it was supposed to transcribe, are intact.\n\nHow does this mutated circuit now function as a logic gate?\n\nA.
