The goal is to create a genetic circuit where a reporter protein is produced only when two specific signaling molecules, Inducer A and Inducer B, are *not* simultaneously present at high concentrations. The circuit is constructed from three modules integrated into a single plasmid.\n\n**Module 1: The Sensor-Activator**\nThis module uses a split protein system.\n- The gene for the N-terminal fragment of T7 RNA polymerase (N-T7) is placed under the control of a promoter, $P_A$, which is only activated by a high concentration of Inducer A.\n- The gene for the C-terminal fragment of T7 RNA polymerase (C-T7) is placed under the control of a promoter, $P_B$, which is only activated by a high concentration of Inducer B.\n- A fully functional T7 RNA polymerase enzyme can only be formed when both the N-T7 and C-T7 fragments are present in the cell and assemble together.\n\n**Module 2: The Inverter**\n- The gene for a repressor protein, TetR, is placed under the control of a T7-specific promoter, $P_{T7}$. This promoter is only transcribed by a functional, assembled T7 RNA polymerase.\n\n**Module 3: The Reporter**\n- The gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is placed under the control of the promoter $P_{Tet}$.\n- The promoter $P_{Tet}$ is constitutively active (always \"ON\") in the absence of the TetR protein. However, when TetR is present, it binds to $P_{Tet}$ and strongly represses its activity, turning it \"OFF\".\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, assume that \"Low\" concentration of an inducer means the corresponding promoter is completely inactive, and \"High\" concentration means it is fully active. Similarly, \"High\" GFP expression corresponds to an un-repressed $P_{Tet}$ promoter, and \"Low\" GFP expression corresponds to a fully repressed promoter.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the level of GFP expression for each combination of inducer concentrations?\n\nA. \n- Inducer A: Low, Inducer B: Low → GFP Expression: Low\n- Inducer A: Low, Inducer B: High → GFP Expression: Low\n- Inducer A: High, Inducer B: Low → GFP Expression: Low\n- Inducer A: High, Inducer B: High → GFP Expression: High\n\nB. \n- Inducer A: Low, Inducer B: Low → GFP Expression: High\n- Inducer A: Low, Inducer B: High → GFP Expression: Low\n- Inducer A: High, Inducer B: Low → GFP Expression: Low\n- Inducer A: High, Inducer B: High → GFP Expression: Low\n\nC. \n- Inducer A: Low, Inducer B: Low → GFP Expression: Low\n- Inducer A: Low, Inducer B: High → GFP Expression: High\n- Inducer A: High, Inducer B: Low → GFP Expression: High\n- Inducer A: High, Inducer B: High → GFP Expression: High\n\nD. \n- Inducer A: Low, Inducer B: Low → GFP Expression: High\n- Inducer A: Low, Inducer B: High → GFP Expression: High\n- Inducer A: High, Inducer B: Low → GFP Expression: High\n- Inducer A: High, Inducer B: High → GFP Expression: Low\n\nE.\n- Inducer A: Low, Inducer B: Low → GFP Expression: High\n- Inducer A: Low, Inducer B: High → GFP Expression: High\n- Inducer A: High, Inducer B: Low → GFP Expression: Low\n- Inducer A: High, Inducer B: High → GFP Expression: High", "solution": "Let the promoter activities be represented by binary variables: $A \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for $P_{A}$ (with $A=1$ if Inducer A is High, $A=0$ if Low) and $B \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for $P_{B}$ (with $B=1$ if Inducer B is High, $B=0$ if Low). Define the GFP output $G \\in \\{0,1\\}$ with $G=1$ for High GFP expression and $G=0$ for Low GFP expression.\n\nBy Module 1, a functional T7 RNA polymerase forms only when both N-T7 and C-T7 are expressed. Therefore the presence of functional T7 is the logical AND of $A$ and $B$:\n$$\n\\text{T7} = A \\cdot B.\n$$\n\nBy Module 2, TetR is produced only from $P_{T7}$ when T7 is present, hence\n$$\n\\text{TetR} = \\text{T7} = A \\cdot B.\n$$\n\nBy Module 3, $P_{Tet}$ is constitutively ON but is fully repressed when TetR is present.

This exercise introduces the \"repressilator,\" a classic design that uses a closed-loop of three repressors to create a biological clock.

The circuit consists of three genes, which we will call Gene A, Gene B, and Gene C. The protein products of these genes are P_A, P_B, and P_C, respectively. The regulatory network is designed as a cascade of repression:\n- Protein P_A represses the promoter of Gene B.\n- Protein P_B represses the promoter of Gene C.\n- Protein P_C represses the promoter of Gene A, thus closing a negative feedback loop.\n\nTo analyze the system's dynamics, we will use a simplified time-delay model. Let's make the following assumptions:\n1.  Once a gene's promoter is de-repressed (i.e., becomes active), it takes a characteristic time, $\\tau_p$, for the processes of transcription and translation to produce a sufficient concentration of the corresponding protein to repress its target.\n2.  Once a gene's expression is turned off, it takes a characteristic time, $\\tau_d$, for its protein product to be degraded or diluted to a concentration low enough to de-repress its target promoter.\n3.  The acts of repression and de-repression at the promoter site are considered to occur instantaneously once the protein concentration crosses the required threshold.\n\nAssume the system has reached a stable oscillatory state. Starting from the exact moment ($t=0$) that the concentration of P_C drops low enough to de-repress the promoter for Gene A, determine the period, $T$, of the resulting oscillation. Express your answer as an analytical expression in terms of $\\tau_p$ and $\\tau_d$.", "solution": "We model promoter state changes as instantaneous once thresholds are crossed, with two characteristic delays:\n- Production delay: when a promoter is derepressed and a gene turns on, it takes time $\\tau_p$ before its protein reaches the threshold to repress its target.\n- Decay delay: when a gene turns off, it takes time $\\tau_d$ for its protein to decay sufficiently to relieve repression of its target.\n\nStarting at $t=0$, protein $P_C$ is low enough to derepress Gene A, so A turns on at $t=0$. We then follow the sequence of threshold-crossing events driven by the repressing interactions:\n1. A turns on at $t=0$. After $\\tau_p$, $P_A$ accumulates to repress B: B turns off at $t=\\tau_p$.\n2. After B turns off, it takes $\\tau_d$ for $P_B$ to decay and derepress C: C turns on at $t=\\tau_p+\\tau_d$.\n3. After C turns on, it takes $\\tau_p$ for $P_C$ to accumulate and repress A: A turns off at $t=2\\tau_p+\\tau_d$.\n4. After A turns off, it takes $\\tau_d$ for $P_A$ to decay and derepress B: B turns on at $t=2\\tau_p+2\\tau_d$.\n5.

Consider a scenario where a circuit must differentiate between a sustained, low-amplitude chemical exposure and a transient, high-amplitude pulse of the same chemical. Both signals deliver the exact same total molecular dose over time.\n\nYou are tasked with comparing the signal-discrimination capabilities of two different genetic circuits. Both circuits produce an output protein, $P$, in response to an input chemical inducer, $I$. The concentration of the inducer is denoted by $[I](t)$.\n\n**Circuit 1 (Linear Response):** The production of protein $P_1$ is linearly proportional to the inducer concentration. Its dynamics are described by the equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[P_1]}{dt} = \\alpha [I](t) - \\delta [P_1] $$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a production constant and $\\delta$ is the first-order degradation and dilution rate constant for the protein.\n\n**Circuit 2 (Ultrasensitive Response):** This circuit employs a promoter that is cooperatively activated by the inducer, exhibiting a sigmoidal response. The production of protein $P_2$ is governed by a Hill-type equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[P_2]}{dt} = \\beta \\frac{[I](t)^2}{K^2 + [I](t)^2} - \\delta [P_2] $$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the maximal production rate, $K$ is the activation coefficient (the concentration of $[I]$ required for half-maximal activation), and $\\delta$ is the same degradation/dilution rate constant as in Circuit 1.\n\nThe two input signals to be distinguished are:\n- **Signal A (Sustained):** A rectangular pulse of low amplitude $[I](t) = I_0$ for a duration $0 \\le t \\le T$.\n- **Signal B (Transient):** A rectangular pulse of high amplitude $[I](t) = N I_0$ for a duration $0 \\le t \\le T/N$, where $N > 1$.\n\nNote that the total integrated dose, $\\int_0^\\infty [I](t) dt$, is identical for both signals ($I_0 T = (NI_0) \\cdot (T/N)$).\n\nTo solve this problem, you should work under the following set of approximations, which are common in the analysis of such circuits:\n1. The low amplitude $I_0$ is much smaller than the activation coefficient $K$, i.e., $I_0 \\ll K$.\n2. The high amplitude $N I_0$ is much larger than the activation coefficient $K$, i.e., $N I_0 \\gg K$.\n3.
