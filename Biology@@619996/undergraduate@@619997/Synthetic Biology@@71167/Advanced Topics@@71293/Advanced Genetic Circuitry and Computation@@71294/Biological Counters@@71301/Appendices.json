The state of one bit in this counter is represented by the concentration of a reporter protein. When the bit is '0', the gene for this protein is completely repressed. When the bit flips to '1', this repression is removed, and the gene is expressed.\n\nConsider a simplified model of this \"flip\" process. At time $t < 0$, the system is in the '0' state, so the concentrations of both the reporter's messenger RNA (mRNA) and the reporter protein itself are zero. At $t = 0$, an inducer molecule is introduced, which instantly and completely lifts the repression. The gene begins to be transcribed and subsequently translated.\n\nThe dynamics of the system for $t \\ge 0$ can be modeled by the following processes:\n1.  The concentration of mRNA, $M(t)$, is produced at a constant rate $\\alpha_M$ and degrades with a first-order rate constant $\\delta_M$.\n2.  The concentration of the reporter protein, $P(t)$, is translated from the mRNA at a rate proportional to $M(t)$ with a rate constant $\\alpha_P$, and it degrades with a first-order rate constant $\\delta_P$.\n\nTo simplify the analysis, assume that the degradation rate constants for the mRNA and the protein are equal: $\\delta_M = \\delta_P = \\delta$.\n\nThe bit is considered to have successfully flipped from '0' to '1' when the protein concentration $P(t)$ reaches exactly half of its final, long-term steady-state value.

The objective is to create a circuit where the cell population cycles through three distinct fluorescent states: Red, then Green, then Blue, and then back to Red. Each state transition should be triggered by a discrete external pulse of the sugar arabinose (Ara).\n\nThe circuit consists of three genes: `gR`, `gG`, and `gB`, which code for a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), and a Blue Fluorescent Protein (BFP), respectively. In a clever design twist, these fluorescent proteins have also been engineered to function as transcription factors. The arabinose pulse is detected by the protein AraC; when arabinose is present, the complex `AraC-Ara` is formed, which acts as a universal co-activator for all state-advancing transcription events. The circuit is designed such that protein degradation is sufficiently rapid, ensuring that only the protein of the current state is present in significant quantities when the next pulse arrives.\n\nThe operational logic for the counter is based on a series of transcriptional `AND` gates, where a state transition requires both the protein of the current state and the `AraC-Ara` pulse signal to be present. The team has already successfully implemented parts of the circuit:\n- **Transition R → G:** The promoter of `gG` (`pG`) is activated only by the simultaneous presence of both RFP and the `AraC-Ara` complex.\n- **Transition B → R:** The promoter of `gR` (`pR`) is activated only by the simultaneous presence of both BFP and the `AraC-Ara` complex.\n- **Self-Repression:** To ensure a clean switch, the promoter of the current state's gene is repressed when a transition is triggered. For example, during the R → G transition, the promoter `pR` is repressed by the combination of RFP and `AraC-Ara`.\n\nThe final step is to design the promoter for the gene `gB`, denoted `pB`, to handle the transition from the Green state to the Blue state.

This would activate $pB$ even when $A=0$, causing spontaneous $G \\rightarrow B$ without a pulse, violating the counting-by-pulses requirement.\n- Option B: $P_{B} = A$. This would activate $pB$ on any pulse regardless of state, e.g., from $R$ or $B$, corrupting the cycle order.\n- Option C: $P_{B} = G \\land A$. This exactly implements the required AND gate for $G \\rightarrow B$ and preserves the intended $R \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow R$ sequence.\n- Option D: $P_{B} = \\lnot(G \\land A)$.

The system consists of four distinct, invertible DNA segments, labeled 1 to 4 from innermost to outermost. The orientation of each segment can be flipped by a specific recombinase enzyme. There are two types of recombinases available: Cre, which acts exclusively on `loxP` sites, and Flp, which acts on `FRT` sites. A segment flanked by `loxP` sites is called a 'Cre-unit', and one flanked by `FRT` sites is a 'Flp-unit'.\n\nThe segments are arranged in a nested 'Russian doll' architecture: Segment 2 contains Segment 1, Segment 3 contains Segment 2, and Segment 4 contains Segment 3. The state of the counter is defined by the orientation vector of the four segments relative to the main chromosome (the external frame of reference). For example, a state might be (forward, reverse, forward, forward). It has been established that when a segment is flipped by its corresponding recombinase, all segments nested inside it are also inverted with respect to the external frame.
