The timer's state is monitored by the concentration of a fluorescent protein, which we'll call Fluor-P. At time $t=0$, the system is in a steady state with a high concentration of Fluor-P. An external signal is then applied, which completely halts the production of any new Fluor-P molecules. The existing Fluor-P molecules within the cell are naturally degraded. This degradation process follows first-order kinetics, and the protein is known to have a half-life of $t_{1/2} = 30.0$ minutes.\n\nCalculate the time at which the concentration of Fluor-P will have decreased to 5.00% of its initial value at $t=0$.

This process is stated to follow first-order kinetics. The concentration of the protein, $C(t)$, at any time $t$ can be described by the first-order decay equation:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nwhere $C_0$ is the initial concentration of the protein at $t=0$, and $\\lambda$ is the first-order decay constant.\n\nThe problem provides the half-life of the protein, $t_{1/2}$, which is the time required for the concentration to fall to half of its initial value. We can use this information to find the decay constant $\\lambda$. By definition, at $t=t_{1/2}$, the concentration is $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}C_0$. Substituting this into the decay equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t_{1/2})$$\nDividing both sides by $C_0$ gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-\\lambda t_{1/2})$$\nTo solve for $\\lambda$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\lambda t_{1/2}$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, we get:\n$$-\\ln(2) = -\\lambda t_{1/2}$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$, we find the relationship between the decay constant and the half-life:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the time $t$ when the concentration $C(t)$ has decreased to 5.00% of its initial value $C_0$. This can be written as $C(t) = 0.0500 C_0$. We substitute this condition into the primary decay equation:\n$$0.0500 C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nAgain, we can cancel $C_0$ from both sides:\n$$0.0500 = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for $t$:\n$$\\ln(0.0500) = -\\lambda t$$\n$$t = -\\frac{\\ln(0.0500)}{\\lambda}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\lambda$ that we derived from the half-life:\n$$t = -\\frac{\\ln(0.0500)}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}}$$\nRearranging the expression gives:\n$$t = -t_{1/2} \\frac{\\ln(0.0500)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nThe problem states that $t_{1/2} = 30.0$ minutes.

This exercise walks you through a simple genetic timer circuit that uses this very principle [@problem_id:2061398]. By considering a hypothetical scenario where the key delay protein is made perfectly stable, you will uncover the crucial design role of degradation in creating tunable and predictable delays.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist designs a genetic timer circuit in a bacterium. The circuit is designed to activate an output only after a specific time delay following the introduction of an inducer molecule.\n\nThe circuit operates as follows:\n1.  At time $t=0$, an inducer molecule, `Inducer-X`, is added to the cell culture.\n2.  `Inducer-X` activates a promoter, `P_act`, which simultaneously drives the transcription of two genes: `geneR` and `geneD`.\n3.  `geneR` produces a repressor protein, `ProtR`. `ProtR` immediately binds to an output promoter, `P_out`, strongly inhibiting the expression of a fluorescent reporter gene, `geneZFP`.\n4.  `geneD` produces a delay protein, `ProtD`. In its normal, wild-type configuration, `ProtD` is subject to active cellular degradation, giving it a characteristic half-life. It must accumulate to a critical concentration, $C_{crit}$, before it can bind to and inactivate `ProtR`.\n5.  When the concentration of `ProtD` reaches $C_{crit}$, `ProtR` is sequestered, `P_out` is de-repressed, and `geneZFP` is expressed, causing the bacterium to fluoresce. The time taken for this to occur is the characteristic delay, $T_{delay}$.\n\nNow, consider a mutant version of this circuit where `geneD` has been altered. The resulting mutant protein, `ProtD_mut`, is completely stable and is no longer subject to any cellular degradation. Its ability to bind and inactivate `ProtR` is identical to the wild-type `ProtD`.\n\nAssuming the cells are non-fluorescent at $t=0$ and `Inducer-X` is continuously present for all $t > 0$, how will the fluorescent output of the cells containing the mutant circuit behave compared to the wild-type circuit?\n\nA. The fluorescent output will turn on after a delay that is shorter than the normal $T_{delay}$, and it will then remain on indefinitely.\n\nB. The fluorescent output will never turn on.\n\nC. The fluorescent output will turn on after a delay that is longer than the normal $T_{delay}$, and it will then remain on indefinitely.\n\nD. The circuit will produce a single, brief pulse of fluorescence after a delay shorter than $T_{delay}$, and then turn off permanently.\n\nE. The circuit will behave identically to the wild-type circuit, turning on after the normal delay $T_{delay}$.", "solution": "Let the production of the delay protein from the activated promoter be constant for $t>0$ with rate $k_{D}$, and let the wild-type delay protein undergo first-order degradation with rate constant $\\gamma>0$.

The output turns on when the relevant delay protein concentration reaches the threshold $C_{\\text{crit}}$.\n\nFor the wild-type delay protein, the mass balance under continuous induction is\n$$\n\\frac{dD}{dt}=k_{D}-\\gamma D,\\quad D(0)=0.\n$$\nSolving yields\n$$\nD(t)=\\frac{k_{D}}{\\gamma}\\left(1-\\exp(-\\gamma t)\\right).\n$$\nThe time to reach the threshold $C_{\\text{crit}}$ satisfies\n$$\nC_{\\text{crit}}=\\frac{k_{D}}{\\gamma}\\left(1-\\exp(-\\gamma T_{\\text{wt}})\\right)\n\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\nT_{\\text{wt}}=\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{k_{D}}{k_{D}-\\gamma C_{\\text{crit}}}\\right),\n$$\nwhich requires $C_{\\text{crit}}<\\frac{k_{D}}{\\gamma}$ for the threshold to be reachable.\n\nFor the mutant delay protein, which has no degradation, the mass balance is\n$$\n\\frac{dD_{\\text{mut}}}{dt}=k_{D},\\quad D_{\\text{mut}}(0)=0,\n$$\nso\n$$\nD_{\\text{mut}}(t)=k_{D}t.\n$$\nThe mutant threshold time is then\n$$\nT_{\\text{mut}}=\\frac{C_{\\text{crit}}}{k_{D}}.\n$$\n\nCompare $T_{\\text{mut}}$ with $T_{\\text{wt}}$.

In the mutant, $D_{\\text{mut}}(t)$ continues to increase without bound for as long as the inducer is present, ensuring persistent sequestration of newly produced repressor and sustained derepression. Therefore, the fluorescent output turns on after a shorter delay than the normal $T_{\\text{delay}}$ and remains on indefinitely.\n\nHence, among the options, the correct behavior is that described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2061398"}, {"introduction": "Sophisticated cellular behaviors are often achieved by integrating simple genetic modules into more complex networks.

When exposed to a constant inducer signal, the circuit produces periodic pulses of an output protein. A key design feature is a shutdown mechanism that ensures the circuit produces a predetermined number of pulses and then ceases activity permanently.\n\nThe shutdown mechanism relies on an \"accumulator\" protein, $A$. In the presence of the inducer, $A$ is produced and accumulates. The concentration of $A$, denoted $A(t)$, is described by the first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = k_{\\text{prod}} - k_{\\text{deg}}A $$\nHere, $k_{\\text{prod}}$ is the constant production rate, $k_{\\text{deg}}$ is the first-order degradation rate constant, and we assume $A(0) = 0$.

The periodic pulses are generated with a fixed period $T_{\\text{osc}}$.\n\nThe goal is to tune the circuit to produce exactly three pulses.
