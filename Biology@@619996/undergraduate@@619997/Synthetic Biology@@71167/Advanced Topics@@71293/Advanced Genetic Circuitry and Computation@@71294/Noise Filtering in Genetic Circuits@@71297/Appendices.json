Consider a simple transcriptional cascade designed in a bacterium, where a protein X acts as a transcriptional activator for a downstream gene that produces protein Y.\n\nThe dynamics of the system at the protein level are modeled as follows:\n- Protein X is produced at a constant average rate and is degraded or diluted with a first-order rate constant $\\gamma_X$. At steady state, a consequence of these stochastic birth-death processes is that the number of X molecules, $n_X$, can be modeled by a Poisson distribution. This results in a squared coefficient of variation (a measure of noise strength) of $CV_X^2 = 1/\\langle n_X \\rangle$, where $\\langle n_X \\rangle$ is the mean number of X molecules.\n- The production rate of protein Y is linearly dependent on the number of X activator molecules, such that the instantaneous rate is $k_{s,Y} = \\beta n_X$, for some constant $\\beta$. Protein Y is degraded or diluted with a first-order rate constant $\\gamma_Y$.\n\nFor such a linear cascade, the total noise strength of the downstream protein Y, $CV_Y^2 = \\sigma_Y^2 / \\langle n_Y \\rangle^2$, is the sum of its intrinsic noise (from its own stochastic production and degradation) and the extrinsic noise propagated from the upstream activator X.

Consider a synthetic gene circuit designed to produce a protein $P$. The production of this protein is activated by the cell's energetic state, which we represent by the concentration of a signaling molecule $A$ (conceptually related to the ratio of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP)). To buffer against rapid fluctuations, or \"noise\", in the energy state, the circuit employs a negative feedback loop where the protein $P$ represses its own transcription.\n\nThe dynamics of this system can be modeled by a set of linearized differential equations describing the fluctuations of the messenger RNA (mRNA) concentration, $\\delta m(t)$, and the protein concentration, $\\delta p(t)$, around their stable steady-state operating point. These equations are given by:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\delta m)}{dt} = G_A \\delta A(t) - G_p \\delta p(t) - \\gamma_m \\delta m(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{d(\\delta p)}{dt} = k_{tln} \\delta m(t) - \\gamma_p \\delta p(t) $$\n\nHere, $\\delta A(t)$ represents the fluctuation in the signaling molecule concentration around its mean value. The parameters of the model are all positive real constants:\n-   $G_A$: The gain that quantifies how strongly the signaling molecule $A$ activates transcription.\n-   $G_p$: The gain of the negative feedback loop from the protein $P$ to its own transcription.\n-   $\\gamma_m$: The effective degradation and dilution rate of the mRNA.\n-   $\\gamma_p$: The effective degradation and dilution rate of the protein.\n-   $k_{tln}$: The rate of protein translation from mRNA.\n\nThe fluctuations in the cellular energy state, $\\delta A(t)$, are modeled as a white noise process. This means the fluctuations have no temporal correlation and their power is distributed uniformly across all frequencies.
