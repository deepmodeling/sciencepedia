The architecture is as follows: an external chemical signal, $S$, induces the expression of Gene X, leading to the production of Protein X. Protein X, a transcription factor, then activates the expression of Gene Y, leading to the production of Protein Y. The expression of a final output, Gene Z, which produces a fluorescent Protein Z, requires the simultaneous presence of both Protein X and Protein Y acting as co-activators at the promoter of Gene Z.\n\nThis circuit filters out transient or short-lived signals. An output (fluorescence from Protein Z) is only observed if the signal $S$ persists for a duration longer than a specific minimum time, which we define as $T_{min}$. This delay is primarily due to the time it takes for Protein Y to be synthesized and accumulate to its required concentration.\n\nFor the system to function, the concentrations of the proteins must exceed certain activation thresholds. The activation of Gene Y's promoter by Protein X requires the concentration of X, $[X]$, to be above a threshold $K_X$. For Gene Z's promoter to be activated, $[X]$ must be above $K_X$ AND the concentration of Y, $[Y]$, must be above a threshold $K_Y$. The value of the threshold constant $K_Y$ is inversely related to the binding affinity of Protein Y for the promoter of Gene Z; a weaker binding affinity corresponds to a higher value of $K_Y$.\n\nA mutation is introduced into the DNA sequence of the promoter for Gene Z.
