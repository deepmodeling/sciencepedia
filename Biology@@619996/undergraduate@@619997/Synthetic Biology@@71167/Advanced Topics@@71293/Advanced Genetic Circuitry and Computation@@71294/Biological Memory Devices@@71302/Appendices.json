This circuit's ability to exist in one of two stable states—a property known as bistability—is key to its function. This exercise [@problem_id:2022827] challenges you to connect this theoretical concept to tangible experimental data, interpreting a common result from flow cytometry to understand what memory looks like at the single-cell level within a large population.", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is engineering a bacterial whole-cell biosensor capable of remembering a transient exposure to a specific chemical. They construct a genetic circuit in *E. coli* known as a toggle switch. This circuit consists of two genes, Gene A and Gene B, whose protein products, Repressor A and Repressor B, are mutual transcriptional repressors. That is, Repressor A binds to the promoter of Gene B to inhibit its transcription, and Repressor B binds to the promoter of Gene A to inhibit its transcription.\n\nTo visualize the state of the switch, the gene for a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is placed under the control of the same promoter as Gene B, such that high expression of Gene B results in a high level of fluorescence. The system is designed such that initially, a population of cells is stabilized in a \"memory-OFF\" state, characterized by high levels of Repressor A and consequently low levels of Repressor B and GFP.\n\nThe circuit can be switched to a \"memory-ON\" state (low Repressor A, high Repressor B and GFP) by the transient presence of an inducer molecule, Inducer X, which specifically inhibits the function of Repressor A. In an experiment, the population of cells, initially in the memory-OFF state, is exposed to a brief pulse of Inducer X. The inducer is then thoroughly washed away, and the cells are cultured for several generations. The fluorescence intensity of thousands of individual cells from the resulting population is then measured using flow cytometry.\n\nThe analysis of the flow cytometry data reveals a bimodal distribution of fluorescence intensities: a significant peak at a low fluorescence level, corresponding to the initial memory-OFF state, and another significant peak at a much higher fluorescence level. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate physical interpretation of this observed bimodal distribution?\n\nA. Each cell in the population is in a state of 'mixed expression', simultaneously producing both low and high amounts of GFP. The two peaks represent the two most probable expression levels within this mixed state.\n\nB. The inducer was not fully removed, causing all cells to express an intermediate, unstable level of GFP, which then randomly resolves into either a low or high fluorescence group upon measurement.\n\nC. The cell population has partitioned into two distinct and stable subpopulations. One subpopulation consists of cells that remained in the memory-OFF state, while the other consists of cells that successfully switched to and latched into the stable memory-ON state.\n\nD. All cells in the population are continuously and rapidly oscillating between the low and high fluorescence states. The two peaks correspond to the points in the oscillation cycle where the cells spend the most time.\n\nE. The bimodal distribution is a result of random genetic mutations that occurred during cell culture, creating two distinct genotypes with different baseline GFP expression levels.", "solution": "Let $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ denote the intracellular concentrations of Repressor A and Repressor B, respectively. In a standard mutual-repression toggle switch, the deterministic dynamics can be represented by Hill-type regulatory functions:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt}=\\frac{\\alpha_{A}}{1+\\left(\\frac{B}{K_{B}}\\right)^{n_{B}}}-\\delta_{A}A,\\qquad\n\\frac{dB}{dt}=\\frac{\\alpha_{B}}{1+\\left(\\frac{A}{K_{A}}\\right)^{n_{A}}}-\\delta_{B}B,\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{A},\\alpha_{B}$ are maximal production rates, $K_{A},K_{B}$ are dissociation constants, $n_{A},n_{B}$ are Hill coefficients (cooperativity), and $\\delta_{A},\\delta_{B}$ are effective degradation/dilution rates. GFP is under the control of Gene B’s promoter, so GFP fluorescence is a monotonic reporter of $B$; therefore low fluorescence corresponds to low $B$ and high fluorescence corresponds to high $B$.\n\nSteady states satisfy $dA/dt=0$ and $dB/dt=0$, i.e., the intersections of the nullclines\n$$\nA=\\frac{\\alpha_{A}}{\\delta_{A}}\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{B}{K_{B}}\\right)^{n_{B}}},\\qquad\nB=\\frac{\\alpha_{B}}{\\delta_{B}}\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{A}{K_{A}}\\right)^{n_{A}}}.\n$$\nFor sufficiently strong cooperativity and production relative to degradation (e.g., $n_{A}>1$ and $n_{B}>1$ with appropriate parameter magnitudes), these nullclines typically intersect at three points: two stable fixed points (attractors) and one unstable saddle. The two stable equilibria correspond to the “memory-OFF” state (high $A$, low $B$ and thus low GFP) and the “memory-ON” state (low $A$, high $B$ and thus high GFP). This arises from positive feedback inherent in mutual repression, which yields bistability and hysteresis.\n\nThe inducer $X$ inhibits Repressor A function during a transient pulse. Mathematically, this shifts the effective repression term on Gene B or reduces the effective activity of $A$, transiently deforming the nullclines and moving the system’s state across the separatrix (the stable manifold of the saddle) into the basin of attraction of the high-$B$ equilibrium. After $X$ is washed out, the nullclines return to their original configuration, but cells that crossed the separatrix remain in the high-$B$ basin and relax to the high-$B$ steady state; cells that did not cross remain in the low-$B$ state. Because single-cell gene expression is subject to intrinsic and extrinsic noise and cells differ in initial conditions and parameter values, only a fraction of the population crosses the separatrix during the pulse. Consequently, after washout and several generations, the population partitions into two stable subpopulations: one at the low-$B$ (low fluorescence) attractor and one at the high-$B$ (high fluorescence) attractor. Flow cytometry, which measures single-cell fluorescence snapshots, therefore yields a bimodal distribution with peaks near the two stable steady-state expression levels.\n\nThis physical picture directly supports the interpretation that the bimodality reflects two distinct, stable cellular states of the same genetic circuit. The alternative options are inconsistent with the mechanism and measurements:\n- Against A: At the time of measurement each cell occupies a single expression state; the two peaks arise from population-level heterogeneity between two stable attractors, not from a mixed expression state within individual cells.\n- Against B: Incomplete removal would bias all cells toward reduced effective $A$ activity during measurement; moreover, the observed persistence over generations after thorough washout and the known bistability argue for stable latching rather than random post-measurement resolution of an unstable intermediate.\n- Against D: The canonical mutual-repression toggle is bistable, not an oscillator; oscillations typically require negative feedback with delay. Unsynchronized rapid oscillations would yield a broadened unimodal distribution or time-averaged fluorescence, not two sharp stable peaks corresponding to steady states.\n- Against E: Random mutations on the experimental timescale would not reproducibly generate two discrete high-occupancy peaks aligned with the designed ON and OFF states; sorting and regrowth experiments in such systems demonstrate heritable, epigenetic memory consistent with bistability rather than genetic divergence.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate physical interpretation is that the population has split into two distinct, stable subpopulations corresponding to the OFF and ON attractors of the bistable toggle switch, with GFP high in the ON state and low in the OFF state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2022827"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply storing a bit of information, a key goal in synthetic biology is to build circuits with robust control mechanisms. This problem [@problem_id:2022846] moves from analyzing a basic toggle switch to actively designing an enhancement: a global 'reset' function. This practice will deepen your understanding of circuit logic and the power of using orthogonal components to add new layers of control without disrupting the core system.", "problem": "In synthetic biology, a genetic toggle switch is a classic example of an engineered bistable system that can serve as a simple memory device. Consider a standard toggle switch constructed in *E. coli*. The circuit consists of two genes encoding repressor proteins, which we will call Repressor 1 (`R1`) and Repressor 2 (`R2`). The gene for `R1` is transcribed from Promoter A (`P_A`), and the gene for `R2` is transcribed from Promoter B (`P_B`). The key interaction is mutual repression: the `R1` protein represses `P_B`, and the `R2` protein represses `P_A`.\n\nThis mutual repression creates two stable steady states:\n- State I: High concentration of `R1`, low concentration of `R2`.\n- State II: Low concentration of `R1`, high concentration of `R2`.\n\nThe system can be \"toggled\" between these states using external inducers that temporarily inactivate one of the repressors.\n\nYour task is to design a modification to this circuit that introduces a global \"reset\" function. This reset, when triggered by a specific external chemical signal, must reliably force the system into a well-defined 'OFF' state, characterized by low concentrations of both `R1` and `R2`. The system should remain in this 'OFF' state as long as the reset signal is present and should be capable of being set to State I or State II once the signal is removed.\n\nWhich of the following proposed genetic modifications would correctly and specifically implement such a global reset mechanism?\n\nA. Modify `P_A` to include an additional operator site that binds `R1`, thereby making the expression of `R1` self-repressing.\n\nB. Replace `P_B` with a promoter that is activated, rather than repressed, by the `R1` protein.\n\nC. Introduce a third gene into the cell that codes for an orthogonal repressor protein, `R3` (i.e., one that does not interact with `R1` or `R2`). Place this gene under the control of a promoter that is inducible by an external chemical signal, `S`. Then, add operator sites for `R3` to both `P_A` and `P_B`.\n\nD. Use strong, constitutive promoters for both the `R1` and `R2` genes, removing the original `P_A` and `P_B` promoters.\n\nE.

A standard deterministic model of the unmodified toggle switch uses Hill-type repression of transcription with degradation-dilution, for example\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{1}}{dt}=\\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{1+\\left(\\frac{R_{2}}{K_{2}}\\right)^{n_{2}}}-\\delta_{1}R_{1},\\qquad\n\\frac{dR_{2}}{dt}=\\frac{\\alpha_{2}}{1+\\left(\\frac{R_{1}}{K_{1}}\\right)^{n_{1}}}-\\delta_{2}R_{2},\n$$\nwith production rate constants $\\alpha_{1},\\alpha_{2}>0$, repression thresholds $K_{1},K_{2}>0$, Hill coefficients $n_{1},n_{2}\\geq 1$, and linear loss rates $\\delta_{1},\\delta_{2}>0$. Mutual repression yields bistability with two stable steady states: $(R_{1}^{\\ast}\\text{ high},R_{2}^{\\ast}\\text{ low})$ and $(R_{1}^{\\ast}\\text{ low},R_{2}^{\\ast}\\text{ high})$.\n\nA global reset requires that, upon application of an external signal $S$, both production terms are strongly suppressed so that the dynamics reduce to linear decay,\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{1}}{dt}\\approx -\\delta_{1}R_{1},\\qquad \\frac{dR_{2}}{dt}\\approx -\\delta_{2}R_{2},\n$$\nwhich has the unique, exponentially stable steady state $R_{1}^{\\ast}=0$ and $R_{2}^{\\ast}=0$; the Jacobian has eigenvalues $-\\delta_{1}$ and $-\\delta_{2}$, both negative, ensuring stability. When $S$ is removed, the system must revert to the original toggle dynamics so it can again support State I or State II and be set by transient inducers.\n\nEvaluate each proposed modification against these requirements:\n\nOption A adds negative autoregulation of $R_{1}$ by modifying $P_{A}$ to bind $R_{1}$. This changes the first equation to include an extra repression factor, for instance\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{1}}{dt}=\\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{R_{2}}{K_{2}}\\right)^{n_{2}}\\right)\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{R_{1}}{K_{1a}}\\right)^{p}\\right)}-\\delta_{1}R_{1},\n$$\nwith $K_{1a}>0$ and $p\\geq 1$. There is no dependence on an external $S$, and even if $R_{1}$ is reduced, $R_{2}$ is derepressed because its production term remains $\\alpha_{2}/(1+(R_{1}/K_{1})^{n_{1}})\\approx \\alpha_{2}$ when $R_{1}$ is low. Thus both $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ cannot be simultaneously forced low. This fails the reset requirement.\n\nOption B replaces $P_{B}$ with an $R_{1}$-activated promoter, yielding a production term such as\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{2}}{dt}=\\alpha_{2}\\frac{\\left(\\frac{R_{1}}{K_{a}}\\right)^{q}}{1+\\left(\\frac{R_{1}}{K_{a}}\\right)^{q}}-\\delta_{2}R_{2},\n$$\nwith $K_{a}>0$ and $q\\geq 1$. This alters the network topology to mixed repression-activation and removes the basis for an externally controlled global reset; there is no mechanism for $S$ to suppress both productions, and in general one cannot obtain an $R_{1}$ low and $R_{2}$ low steady state enforced by $S$. This fails the reset requirement.\n\nOption C introduces an orthogonal repressor $R_{3}$, produced from an $S$-inducible promoter. Let $R_{3}$ satisfy\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{3}}{dt}=\\beta(S)-\\delta_{3}R_{3},\n$$\nwith $\\beta(S)$ large when $S$ is present and $\\beta(S)=0$ when $S$ is absent, and $\\delta_{3}>0$. Adding operator sites for $R_{3}$ to both $P_{A}$ and $P_{B}$ introduces additional repression factors. For independent operators that must both be unbound for transcription, a standard model is multiplicative:\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{1}}{dt}=\\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{R_{2}}{K_{2}}\\right)^{n_{2}}\\right)\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{R_{3}}{K_{3A}}\\right)^{m}\\right)}-\\delta_{1}R_{1},\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{2}}{dt}=\\frac{\\alpha_{2}}{\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{R_{1}}{K_{1}}\\right)^{n_{1}}\\right)\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{R_{3}}{K_{3B}}\\right)^{m}\\right)}-\\delta_{2}R_{2},\n$$\nwith $K_{3A},K_{3B}>0$ and $m\\geq 1$. Under reset ($S$ present), the $R_{3}$ steady state is $R_{3}^{\\ast}=\\beta(S)/\\delta_{3}$, which can be made sufficiently large such that $\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{R_{3}^{\\ast}}{K_{3A}}\\right)^{m}\\right)$ and $\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{R_{3}^{\\ast}}{K_{3B}}\\right)^{m}\\right)$ are large. Consequently, both production terms are driven arbitrarily close to zero, and the dynamics reduce to\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{1}}{dt}\\approx -\\delta_{1}R_{1},\\qquad \\frac{dR_{2}}{dt}\\approx -\\delta_{2}R_{2},\n$$\nso $R_{1}^{\\ast}=0$ and $R_{2}^{\\ast}=0$ is the unique, globally attracting equilibrium while $S$ is present. When $S$ is removed, $\\beta(S)=0$, so $R_{3}(t)=R_{3}(0)\\exp(-\\delta_{3}t)\\to 0$, the $R_{3}$ repression factors disappear, and the system reverts to the original bistable toggle that can be set to State I or State II by transient inputs. This precisely implements a specific, global, and reversible reset.\n\nOption D replaces both regulated promoters with strong constitutive promoters. The equations become\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{1}}{dt}=\\alpha_{1c}-\\delta_{1}R_{1},\\qquad \\frac{dR_{2}}{dt}=\\alpha_{2c}-\\delta_{2}R_{2},\n$$\nwith constants $\\alpha_{1c},\\alpha_{2c}>0$. The steady state is $R_{1}^{\\ast}=\\alpha_{1c}/\\delta_{1}$ and $R_{2}^{\\ast}=\\alpha_{2c}/\\delta_{2}$, typically both high, eliminating bistability and failing to provide an $S$-dependent OFF state. This fails the reset requirement.\n\nOption E introduces an $S$-inducible enzyme that specifically degrades $R_{1}$, adding an $S$-dependent loss term to the $R_{1}$ equation, for example\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{1}}{dt}=\\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{1+\\left(\\frac{R_{2}}{K_{2}}\\right)^{n_{2}}}-\\left(\\delta_{1}+\\gamma(S)\\right)R_{1},\n$$\nwith $\\gamma(S)>0$ when $S$ is present. Under reset, $R_{1}$ is driven low, but then $R_{2}$ is derepressed, giving $\\frac{dR_{2}}{dt}\\approx \\alpha_{2}-\\delta_{2}R_{2}$ and hence $R_{2}^{\\ast}\\approx \\alpha_{2}/\\delta_{2}$ high. Therefore the system is forced to the one-sided State II rather than both low. This fails the reset requirement.\n\nOnly Option C introduces an $S$-controlled, orthogonal repressor that can simultaneously and specifically shut off both promoters to produce a stable, reversible global OFF state and restore the original toggle behavior upon removal of $S$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2022846"}, {"introduction": "Biological memory is not a monolithic concept; the physical medium used to store information dictates the memory's characteristics, such as its permanence and reversibility. This practice [@problem_id:2022788] presents a critical comparison between two major classes of memory devices: a dynamic memory system based on protein concentrations and a permanent one written into the DNA sequence itself. By analyzing how each system is 'erased,' you will explore the fundamental trade-offs that engineers face when choosing the right memory architecture for a specific application.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is comparing two different cellular memory systems engineered in a bacterial host.\n\n**System 1: The Transcriptional Toggle Switch.** This system is built from a genetic circuit containing two genes, `geneA` and `geneB`. The protein product of `geneA`, called `RepA`, represses the promoter of `geneB`. Conversely, the protein product of `geneB`, called `RepB`, represses the promoter of `geneA`. This mutual repression creates two stable states: a \"State A\" where the concentration of `RepA` is high and `RepB` is low, and a \"State B\" where `RepB` is high and `RepA` is low. The memory state is defined by which repressor is dominant. The system can be externally manipulated by two small molecules: `InducerA`, which binds to and inactivates the `RepA` protein, and `InducerB`, which binds to and inactivates the `RepB` protein.\n\n**System 2: The CRISPR DNA Writer.** This system is designed to record the occurrence of a specific event, marked by the presence of a molecule called `WriteSignal`. When `WriteSignal` is present, it triggers the co-expression of a Cas nuclease and a specific guide RNA (gRNA). This complex is programmed to target a specific DNA sequence on a plasmid, known as the \"data locus\". The Cas nuclease creates a double-strand break at this locus. The cell's native repair machinery then fixes the break, which reliably results in a small, permanent insertion or deletion (indel) in the DNA sequence. This permanently changes the data locus from its initial `State_0` to a recorded `State_1`. The memory is the physical state of the DNA at this locus.\n\nThe biologist's goal is to \"erase\" the memory in each system, which is defined as returning the system to a neutral or baseline state (a low-repressor state for System 1, and the `State_0` DNA sequence for System 2). Which of the following statements most accurately describes the fundamental difference in the erasure process for these two systems?\n\nA. Both systems can be erased by introducing a universal chemical \"reset\" agent that degrades all synthetic proteins, as both memory states are ultimately dependent on protein concentrations.\n\nB. Erasing System 1 requires introducing transient chemical signals (inducers) to temporarily disrupt the protein feedback loop, while erasing System 2 requires a second, distinct genetic engineering process to revert the DNA sequence modification.\n\nC. Erasing System 1 requires a targeted genetic editing tool to remove the repressor genes, while erasing System 2 simply requires the addition of a chemical that washes out the `WriteSignal` molecule.\n\nD. Both systems are erased by simply removing the signal that was used to set their current state. The memory state will naturally decay back to a baseline once the input is gone.\n\nE. Erasure of System 1 is achieved by adding a high concentration of `InducerA`, while erasure of System 2 is achieved by adding a high concentration of `InducerB`.", "solution": "We first identify the physical substrate of memory in each system. In System 1 (toggle switch), the memory is stored in protein concentrations: high $A$ (RepA) and low $B$ (RepB) or vice versa.

In the absence of inducers, these nonlinear equations support two stable fixed points (bistability), corresponding to the two memory states. Introducing InducerA and InducerB transiently reduces the effective activity of RepA and RepB.
