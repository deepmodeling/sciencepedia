To rapidly assess their relative transcriptional strengths before engaging in slower in-vivo cloning, the team uses a commercial cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system.\n\nFor each promoter, a linear DNA template is prepared using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Each template consists of one of the five promoter sequences followed by an identical, strong ribosome binding site and the coding sequence for a destabilized Green Fluorescent Protein (deGFP). The concentration of each of the five linear DNA templates is carefully normalized to be identical across all experiments.\n\nFive separate reactions are prepared, each containing one of the DNA templates (P1-deGFP, P2-deGFP, etc.) in the TX-TL master mix. A sixth reaction is prepared as a negative control, containing only the master mix with no added DNA. All reactions are incubated for 2 hours at a constant temperature. After incubation, the fluorescence of each sample is measured in a plate reader, yielding the following data in arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU):\n\n*   Reaction with P1 and P2 templates were accidentally cross-contaminated prior to the experiment.

This is where cell-free systems excel as a diagnostic tool, allowing researchers to deconstruct a biological pathway into its core components. This problem challenges you to design an experiment that systematically isolates transcription, translation, and protein stability issues, demonstrating how cell-free systems enable a \"divide and conquer\" strategy for troubleshooting complex biological systems [@problem_id:2017801].", "problem": "A synthetic biology student is attempting to express a novel fluorescent protein, \"ChronoGlow,\" in *Escherichia coli*. The gene for ChronoGlow is encoded on a plasmid with an appropriate promoter and ribosome binding site. Despite successfully transforming the *E. coli* and inducing expression, the student observes very low fluorescence from the bacterial culture, indicating a disappointingly low yield of functional ChronoGlow protein. The student hypothesizes three possible reasons for this failure:\n1.  **Poor Transcription**: The promoter on the plasmid is not efficiently recognized by the *E. coli* RNA polymerase, leading to very little ChronoGlow messenger RNA (mRNA) being produced.\n2.  **Poor Translation**: The mRNA is produced, but its sequence (e.g., codon usage or secondary structure) prevents efficient translation into protein by the ribosomes.\n3.  **Rapid Protein Degradation**: The ChronoGlow protein is successfully synthesized but is unstable in the cellular environment and is quickly destroyed by native *E. coli* proteases.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, the student has access to a commercial *E. coli*-based cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system. This system contains all the necessary molecular machinery (ribosomes, polymerases, amino acids, nucleotides, etc.) for gene expression in a test tube but lacks the complex regulatory and degradation networks of a living cell. The student also has the ability to synthesize and purify the specific mRNA for ChronoGlow.\n\nWhich of the following experimental plans provides the most direct and systematic approach to distinguish between the three hypothesized failure modes using the available resources?\n\nA.  Perform two separate cell-free experiments. In Experiment 1, add the ChronoGlow DNA plasmid to the TX-TL system. In Experiment 2, add purified ChronoGlow mRNA to the TX-TL system. Compare the final fluorescence from both experiments. If Exp 1 is low and Exp 2 is high, the issue is transcription. If both are low, the issue is translation. If both are high, the issue is likely in vivo protein degradation.\n\nB.  Perform one cell-free experiment by adding the ChronoGlow DNA plasmid to the TX-TL system. If fluorescence is high, conclude that the problem in the live cells is protein degradation. If fluorescence is low, conclude the problem is either transcription or translation, but these cannot be distinguished further.\n\nC.  Focus on the in vivo system. Use quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) to measure ChronoGlow mRNA levels in the *E. coli* cells. Then, run a Western blot to detect the presence of the ChronoGlow protein. A low mRNA level indicates a transcription problem, while high mRNA and low protein levels indicate a translation or degradation problem.\n\nD.  Perform two separate cell-free experiments. In Experiment 1, add the ChronoGlow DNA plasmid to the TX-TL system. In Experiment 2, add the ChronoGlow DNA plasmid along with a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor cocktail. If fluorescence is significantly higher in Experiment 2, conclude that the protein is unstable.\n\nE.  Purify the ChronoGlow protein produced from the cell-free reaction (assuming some is made). Re-introduce this purified protein into a fresh culture of the live *E. coli* cells (that do not contain the plasmid) and measure how quickly the fluorescence disappears to directly measure the degradation rate.", "solution": "We need an approach that isolates each hypothesized failure point by controlling where transcription, translation, and proteolysis can occur, using the provided TX-TL system and purified mRNA.\n\n- To test transcription directly, compare expression from plasmid DNA versus pre-made mRNA in the cell-free TX-TL system. The plasmid requires transcription and translation in the TX-TL, while the purified mRNA bypasses transcription and tests translation alone. Therefore:\n  - If plasmid in TX-TL yields low fluorescence but purified mRNA in TX-TL yields high fluorescence, transcription is the bottleneck.\n  - If both plasmid and mRNA in TX-TL yield low fluorescence, translation is likely the bottleneck (sequence or structure inhibits translation).\n  - If both plasmid and mRNA in TX-TL yield high fluorescence, then the cell-free system can produce stable, fluorescent protein, whereas in vivo it is low, which most directly implicates in vivo protein instability or degradation.\n\n- Evaluate the options:\n  - A explicitly performs these two TX-TL experiments, directly isolating transcription versus translation, and uses the known reduced proteolysis in TX-TL to infer in vivo degradation if TX-TL is successful. This is systematic and directly maps outcomes to each hypothesis.\n  - B cannot distinguish transcription from translation when TX-TL is low and is therefore not sufficiently diagnostic.\n  - C uses in vivo qPCR and Western; while informative, it does not leverage the TX-TL and purified mRNA to isolate translation, and it cannot cleanly separate translation from degradation without additional controls.\n  - D adds protease inhibitors to TX-TL; the TX-TL context already has reduced proteolysis, and this plan does not distinguish transcription versus translation.\n  - E introduces purified protein into live cells; this is confounded by uptake and cellular context and does not diagnose expression pathway failures.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and systematic plan with the given resources is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2017801"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple expression failures, synthetic circuits can sometimes fail because they harm their cellular host. Distinguishing between a circuit that is toxic or imposes a heavy metabolic burden from one that is simply being repressed by the cell can be difficult in vivo. This exercise explores how a cell-free system, which decouples gene expression from cell growth and viability, serves as a powerful environment to diagnose such host-circuit interactions. By comparing in vivo observations with in vitro results, you can unravel the complex interplay between a synthetic construct and its cellular context [@problem_id:2017839].", "problem": "A synthetic biology student designs a genetic circuit intended for high-level protein expression in *Escherichia coli*. The circuit consists of a very strong, constitutive promoter (`P_strong`), a strong ribosome binding site (RBS), and the gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). This entire construct is placed on a high-copy-number plasmid.\n\nUpon transforming the plasmid into an *E. coli* host strain, the student observes two unexpected outcomes:\n1. The bacterial colonies exhibit a significantly slower growth rate compared to control cells containing a similar plasmid without the GFP gene.\n2. The fluorescence measured from the culture is very low, far below the expected output for such a strong expression circuit.\n\nThe student proposes two competing hypotheses to explain this failure:\n- **Hypothesis I (Metabolic Burden):** The high transcriptional and translational load imposed by the circuit is draining the cell's essential resources (e.g., ATP, amino acids, ribosomes), leading to a global slowdown of cellular processes, which in turn limits both cell growth and the production of GFP itself.\n- **Hypothesis II (Cryptic Silencing):** A previously unknown repressor protein native to the host *E. coli* strain is binding to a specific sequence within the synthetic `P_strong` promoter, actively inhibiting the transcription of the GFP gene.\n\nTo distinguish between these two hypotheses, the student adds the purified plasmid DNA to a commercial *E. coli*-based cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system. This system contains a concentrated lysate of *E. coli* (providing ribosomes, RNA polymerase, etc.) and is supplemented with a buffer containing a saturating concentration of all necessary amino acids, nucleotides (NTPs), and an efficient ATP regeneration system. In this cell-free reaction, the student observes a very high level of GFP fluorescence, indicating successful and robust protein expression.\n\nBased on this experimental result, which of the following conclusions is the most direct and strongly supported explanation for the circuit's failure in vivo?\n\nA. The failure in vivo was primarily caused by metabolic burden.\n\nB. The failure in vivo was primarily caused by cryptic silencing.\n\nC. The GFP protein is cytotoxic to living *E. coli* cells.\n\nD. The plasmid was unstable and was being lost from the cell population in vivo.\n\nE. The RBS used in the circuit is inefficient in vivo but functions well in the cell-free system.", "solution": "We begin by enumerating the in vivo observations: (i) cells harboring the high-copy, strong promoter/RBS GFP circuit grow significantly slower than a control plasmid lacking GFP, and (ii) fluorescence is far lower than expected for such a strong expression cassette. The student tests the same plasmid DNA in an *E. coli*-based cell-free TX-TL system that provides saturating amino acids, NTPs, and an ATP regeneration system, and observes very high GFP expression.\n\nWe now derive predictions under each hypothesis and compare them to both in vivo and cell-free outcomes.\n\n1) Hypothesis I (metabolic burden) predicts that very strong transcription and translation from a high-copy plasmid will sequester core resources (ribosomes, RNA polymerase, amino acids, ATP). Consequences:\n- In vivo: global resource competition slows growth and, paradoxically, can reduce the expression of the burdening gene itself because the same limited pool of ribosomes, ATP, and precursors must support both growth and the circuit. Thus, slow growth and low GFP are expected simultaneously.\n- In a cell-free TX-TL with saturating substrates and ATP regeneration, the constraint on resources is relieved. Therefore, the same DNA template should yield high GFP production.\n\n2) Hypothesis II (cryptic silencing by a native repressor) predicts that a host-encoded repressor binds the synthetic promoter and blocks transcription.\n- In vivo: GFP transcription would be actively repressed, yielding low fluorescence. Because repression reduces transcriptional and translational load, it should not cause slower growth relative to a control plasmid lacking the GFP gene; if anything, reduced burden could preserve or improve growth.\n- In a cell-free TX-TL made from *E. coli* lysate, if the putative native repressor were abundant and active, it would also be present and inhibit transcription. High GFP expression in TX-TL is inconsistent with strong active repression under the same transcriptional machinery. Even if one speculated that the repressor is absent, degraded, or too diluted in the lysate, the cell-free result still does not explain the observed slow growth in vivo that repression alone would not produce.\n\nThe TX-TL outcome—very high GFP with saturating resources—directly supports the burden model: when resource limitations are lifted, the circuit expresses strongly; when resources are limiting in vivo, the same circuit both slows growth and under-expresses due to competition.\n\nWe now assess the alternative answer choices for completeness:\n- C (GFP cytotoxic): High expression in cell-free cannot distinguish cytotoxicity from burden, but the specific pairing of slow growth with low fluorescence in vivo is classically explained by resource competition; cryptic toxicity of standard GFP is not directly supported by the TX-TL result and would not be the most direct inference from the experiment performed.\n- D (plasmid instability): If the plasmid were frequently lost, the average burden would decrease and growth would tend to improve, not slow, and the observation of robust expression in TX-TL using the purified plasmid says nothing about in vivo segregation. The in vivo phenotype contradicts plasmid loss as the primary cause.\n- E (RBS inefficient in vivo but efficient in TX-TL): Both contexts use *E. coli* ribosomes; an RBS that fails in vivo but works in an *E. coli* lysate is not a parsimonious explanation, and it does not account for the slowed growth.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and strongly supported conclusion from the TX-TL result, in light of the in vivo phenotype, is that the failure in vivo was primarily due to metabolic burden.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2017839"}]}
