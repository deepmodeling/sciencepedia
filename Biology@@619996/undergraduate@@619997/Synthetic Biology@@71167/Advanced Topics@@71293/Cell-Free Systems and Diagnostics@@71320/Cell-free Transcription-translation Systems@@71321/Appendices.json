Understanding which DNA elements are essential and which are irrelevant in a TX-TL context is crucial for effective experimental design and for appreciating the differences between *in vitro* and *in vivo* environments.", "problem": "A synthetic biology student is designing an experiment to express Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) using a commercial *Escherichia coli*-based cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system. The experiment will be conducted in a batch-mode reaction, where all components are mixed at the beginning and incubated for 2 hours. The student prepares two circular plasmids:\n\n- **Plasmid A**: Contains a gene for GFP expression (driven by a strong promoter and ribosome binding site) and a standard high-copy ColE1 origin of replication (ori).\n- **Plasmid B**: Is identical to Plasmid A in every way, except the DNA sequence corresponding to the ColE1 origin of replication has been deleted.\n\nThe student adds an identical molar concentration of Plasmid A and Plasmid B to two separate, identical TX-TL reactions. Assume that the concentrations of all other necessary resources in the TX-TL system, such as RNA polymerase, ribosomes, amino acids, and nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), are not limiting within the 2-hour reaction time.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the final amount of GFP produced in the two reactions?\n\nA. Reaction A will produce significantly more GFP than Reaction B, as the ColE1 origin will lead to the replication of Plasmid A, thereby increasing the number of available DNA templates for transcription.\n\nB. Reaction A and Reaction B will produce a nearly identical amount of GFP, as the origin of replication's function is not relevant in a standard batch-mode TX-TL system.\n\nC. Reaction B will produce significantly more GFP than Reaction A, because without the need to replicate the plasmid, more of the system's energy and resources can be allocated to transcription and translation.\n\nD. Neither reaction will produce a significant amount of GFP. The absence of the origin of replication in Plasmid B will render it unstable and cause its rapid degradation by nucleases present in the cell extract.\n\nE. Reaction A will produce GFP, but Reaction B will not. The origin of replication is a required element for RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription at the promoter.", "solution": "First, identify the functional elements required for transcription and translation in an Escherichia coli-based cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system operating in batch mode. The necessary elements on the DNA template are a promoter recognized by the supplied RNA polymerase, a ribosome binding site, an open reading frame encoding GFP, and a transcription terminator. An origin of replication is not required for transcription or translation, as it serves in DNA replication initiation in vivo, not in transcription initiation.\n\nSecond, analyze whether plasmid replication will occur in a standard batch-mode TX-TL reaction. ColE1-type replication in vivo requires host replication machinery (e.g., RNase H, DNA polymerase I, DNA ligase, DNA gyrase, primase) and an RNA-based initiation mechanism. Standard TX-TL extracts and commercial kits are designed to support transcription and translation, not robust DNA replication; they typically do not provide the coordinated replication apparatus nor the conditions for ori-dependent plasmid copy number amplification. Therefore, in a batch-mode TX-TL without added replication system, plasmid copy number remains essentially constant over the reaction time, so the presence or absence of a ColE1 origin does not increase template number.\n\nThird, use the stated assumption that transcriptional and translational resources (RNA polymerase, ribosomes, amino acids, NTPs) are not limiting over the 2-hour reaction. With equal initial molar concentrations of Plasmid A and Plasmid B, and no replication, the number of transcriptionally competent templates is effectively equal between the reactions. Since both plasmids have identical promoter and ribosome binding site driving the same GFP coding sequence, the transcription rate per template and translation rate per mRNA are the same, yielding comparable GFP production.\n\nFourth, evaluate potential degradation concerns. Both templates are circular plasmids; circular DNA is generally more resistant to exonucleases than linear DNA in cell extracts. The ColE1 origin sequence is not a protective element against nucleases; deleting it does not intrinsically render a circular plasmid unstable. Thus, there is no mechanistic basis for expecting rapid degradation specifically due to the absence of an origin of replication.\n\nFifth, assess each option against these principles:\n- Option A is incorrect because ori-dependent replication is not expected in standard batch-mode TX-TL, so Plasmid A will not amplify to increase template copy number.\n- Option B is correct because the origin of replication is functionally irrelevant for transcription and translation in this context, leading to nearly identical GFP production given equal initial template concentrations and non-limiting resources.\n- Option C is incorrect because there is no diversion of resources to replication in either reaction; replication is not occurring.\n- Option D is incorrect because the absence of an origin does not cause specific instability of circular DNA in extracts; both plasmids should remain sufficiently stable for expression.\n- Option E is incorrect because RNA polymerase recognizes the promoter, not the origin of replication; ori is not required for transcription initiation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that both reactions produce nearly identical amounts of GFP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2025444"}, {"introduction": "With our reaction set up and our DNA template understood, we can now probe the core molecular machinery at work.

We need to analyze the two key processes: transcription (DNA to mRNA) and translation (mRNA to protein).\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of Transcription**\n\nTranscription is the process of synthesizing mRNA from a DNA template. The necessary components for this process are:\n1.  A DNA template (the GFP plasmid).\n2.  RNA polymerase.\n3.  Ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTPs: ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP) as building blocks.\n4.  A suitable buffer and energy source.\n\nThe problem states that all of these components are present in the reaction mixture. The absence of amino acids does not affect the process of transcription. Therefore, we expect mRNA molecules to be synthesized. We can calculate the total number of mRNA molecules produced.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of DNA plasmid molecules in the reaction volume.\nThe concentration of the plasmid is $[DNA] = 1.0 \\text{ nM} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ mol/L}$.\nThe volume of the reaction is $V = 15.0 \\text{ µL} = 15.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ L}$.\n\nThe number of moles of the plasmid, $n_{DNA}$, is given by the product of concentration and volume:\n$$n_{DNA} = [DNA] \\times V = (1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ mol/L}) \\times (15.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ L}) = 1.5 \\times 10^{-14} \\text{ mol}$$\n\nTo find the number of individual plasmid molecules, $N_{DNA}$, we multiply the number of moles by Avogadro's constant, $N_A$:\n$$N_{DNA} = n_{DNA} \\times N_A = (1.5 \\times 10^{-14} \\text{ mol}) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1}) = 9.033 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ plasmids}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of mRNA molecules, $N_{mRNA}$, produced over the duration of the reaction. The problem states a constant transcription rate, $k_{tx}$, and a reaction time, $t$.\nThe transcription rate is $k_{tx} = 5.0 \\text{ mRNA / (plasmid} \\cdot \\text{min)}$.\nThe reaction time is $t = 90 \\text{ minutes}$.\n\nThe total number of mRNA molecules is the product of the number of plasmids, the transcription rate, and the time:\n$$N_{mRNA} = N_{DNA} \\times k_{tx} \\times t$$\n$$N_{mRNA} = (9.033 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ plasmids}) \\times (5.0 \\frac{\\text{mRNA}}{\\text{plasmid} \\cdot \\text{min}}) \\times (90 \\text{ min})$$\n$$N_{mRNA} = 9.033 \\times 10^{9} \\times 450 \\text{ mRNA}$$\n$$N_{mRNA} = 4064.85 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ mRNA} = 4.06485 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ mRNA}$$\nRounding this to two significant figures gives approximately $4.1 \\times 10^{12}$ mRNA molecules.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of Translation**\n\nTranslation is the process of synthesizing a protein from an mRNA template. The key components for this process are:\n1.  An mRNA template (produced during transcription).\n2.  Ribosomes.\n3.  Amino acids as building blocks for the polypeptide chain.\n4.  Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) to carry the amino acids.\n5.  An energy source.\n\nThe problem explicitly states that the researcher omitted the amino acid mixture from the reaction. Amino acids are the fundamental monomers of proteins. Without them, the ribosomes cannot assemble the polypeptide chain, even if they bind to the mRNA. Therefore, the process of translation is completely stalled.\n\nAs a result, no full-length GFP protein molecules can be synthesized.\n$$N_{GFP} = 0 \\text{ molecules}$$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the results from both parts, we find that approximately $4.1 \\times 10^{12}$ mRNA molecules are produced, while 0 GFP protein molecules are produced.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. mRNA: $4.1 \\times 10^{12}$ molecules; GFP: $8.2 \\times 10^{14}$ molecules (Incorrect GFP count)\nB. mRNA: $4.1 \\times 10^{12}$ molecules; GFP: $0$ molecules (Correct)\nC. mRNA: $0$ molecules; GFP: $0$ molecules (Incorrect mRNA count)\nD. mRNA: $4.5 \\times 10^{10}$ molecules; GFP: $0$ molecules (Incorrect mRNA count, this corresponds to forgetting the time `t` in the calculation)\nE. mRNA: $9.0 \\times 10^{9}$ molecules; GFP: $9.0 \\times 10^{9}$ molecules (Incorrect mRNA and GFP counts, this only uses the initial plasmid count)\n\nThe correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2025428"}]}
