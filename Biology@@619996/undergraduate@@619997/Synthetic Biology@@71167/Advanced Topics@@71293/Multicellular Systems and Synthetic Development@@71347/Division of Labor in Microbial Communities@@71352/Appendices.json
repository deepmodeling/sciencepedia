Consider a two-strain system designed for robust production of a valuable compound 'X'. The system consists of a \"Producer\" strain and a \"Police\" strain.\n\nThe Producer strain is engineered to synthesize compound 'X'. However, this synthesis is metabolically costly, creating an evolutionary pressure for \"Cheater\" mutants to arise. Cheaters are Producer cells that have lost the ability to synthesize 'X' and thus grow faster, eventually taking over the culture.\n\nTo counteract this, a Police strain is co-cultured with the Producers. The Police strain's role is to selectively eliminate any Cheater cells. The system is designed as follows:\n1.  The Police strain constantly secretes a toxin into the shared environment, creating a constant external toxin concentration of $T_{ext}$.\n2.  The Producer strain is engineered with a genetic circuit that co-expresses the pathway for compound 'X' and an antitoxin. The antitoxin neutralizes the toxin from the Police strain.\n3.  A Cheater is a mutant Producer that has lost the function of this entire circuit, meaning it produces neither compound 'X' nor the antitoxin.\n\nLet's model the toxin-antitoxin dynamics within a single cell (which could be a Producer or a Cheater). Let $T(t)$ be the intracellular concentration of the free toxin, and $A(t)$ be the intracellular concentration of the free antitoxin at time $t$.\n\nThe dynamics are governed by the following principles:\n-   Toxin enters the cell from the environment at a rate proportional to the external concentration, given by the term $k_{in} T_{ext}$, where $k_{in}$ is the transport rate constant.\n-   Antitoxin is produced at a constant rate $\\alpha_A$ within the cell. For a Cheater, $\\alpha_A = 0$.\n-   Inside the cell, the toxin ($T$) and antitoxin ($A$) bind to form an inert, non-toxic complex. This neutralization process removes free toxin and antitoxin at a rate given by the term $\\beta T A$, where $\\beta$ is the binding rate constant.\n-   Both free toxin and free antitoxin are cleared from the cell (due to degradation and cell division) at a rate proportional to their own concentration, with the same rate constant $\\delta$.\n\nCombining these effects, the system is described by the following coupled differential equations:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = k_{in} T_{ext} - \\beta T A - \\delta T $$\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\alpha_A - \\beta T A - \\delta A $$\n\nA cell can only survive if the steady-state concentration of intracellular free toxin, $T_{ss}$, remains strictly below a critical toxic threshold, $T_{crit}$.
