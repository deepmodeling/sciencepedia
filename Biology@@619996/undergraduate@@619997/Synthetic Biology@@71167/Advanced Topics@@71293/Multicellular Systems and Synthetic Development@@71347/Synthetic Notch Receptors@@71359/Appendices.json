This exercise tests your understanding of the essential design principle for all synNotch circuits: correctly matching a synthetic transcription factor with its specific promoter to create a tightly-regulated, ligand-dependent response [@problem_id:2073136].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist aims to engineer a mammalian cell-to-cell communication system where a \"receiver\" cell fluoresces red only when it comes into physical contact with a specific \"sender\" cell. The sender cell is engineered to display a unique, surface-anchored ligand.\n\nThe biologist's strategy for the receiver cell involves two key genetic constructs:\n1.  A synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptor designed to bind the sender cell's ligand. Upon ligand binding, a protease cleaves the synNotch receptor, releasing its intracellular domain (ICD) into the cytoplasm. The ICD then travels to the nucleus to act as a transcription factor.\n2.  A reporter plasmid where the expression of Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) is controlled by a specific promoter.\n\nTo build a functional system, the biologist must choose a compatible pair of synNotch ICD and a promoter for the RFP gene. The goal is to ensure that RFP is produced *only* upon receptor activation. Below is a list of available genetic parts:\n-   **Gal4**: The DNA-binding domain of a transcription factor from yeast.\n-   **LexA**: The DNA-binding domain of a transcription repressor from *E. coli*.\n-   **VP64**: A potent transcriptional activation domain derived from a viral protein.\n-   **UAS**: The Upstream Activating Sequence from yeast, which is the DNA binding site for Gal4.\n-   **`LexA` operator**: The DNA binding site for LexA.\n-   **$P_{\\text{min}}$**: A minimal core promoter that has negligible activity on its own but can initiate transcription if recruited by an activation domain.\n-   **$P_{\\text{CMV}}$**: A strong constitutive promoter from the Cytomegalovirus, which is always active in mammalian cells.\n\nWhich of the following combinations for the synNotch Intracellular Domain (ICD) and the promoter driving the RFP gene will result in the desired behavior?\n\nA.

ICD: `Gal4` | Promoter for RFP: `LexA` operator - $P_{\\text{min}}$", "solution": "The design principle is that the synNotch intracellular domain (ICD) released upon receptor activation must function as an inducible transcription factor that specifically activates the RFP reporter only when present. This requires:\n- A DNA-binding domain (DBD) in the ICD to target a specific operator upstream of the reporter.\n- A transcriptional activation domain (AD), such as VP64, to recruit the transcriptional machinery.\n- A promoter architecture in the reporter in which a minimal core promoter, $P_{\\text{min}}$, is coupled to the correct operator sequence recognized by the ICD’s DBD, ensuring negligible basal expression and activation only upon ICD binding.\n\nThe relevant molecular specificities are:\n- Gal4 DBD binds the UAS sequence; it does not bind the `LexA` operator.\n- LexA DBD binds the `LexA` operator; it does not bind UAS.\n- VP64 is an activation domain; without a DBD, it cannot localize to the correct DNA site.\n- $P_{\\text{min}}$ requires an activator tethered to DNA to initiate transcription; $P_{\\text{CMV}}$ is constitutively active and thus unsuitable for inducible expression.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- A. ICD: `VP64` | Promoter: UAS - $P_{\\text{min}}$. VP64 lacks a DBD, so it cannot bind UAS. No targeted activation occurs; expression remains off even after activation. Not suitable.\n- B. ICD: `Gal4-VP64` | Promoter: $P_{\\text{CMV}}$. $P_{\\text{CMV}}$ is constitutive, so RFP would be expressed regardless of synNotch activation. Not suitable.\n- C. ICD: `LexA-VP64` | Promoter: UAS - $P_{\\text{min}}$. LexA binds the `LexA` operator, not UAS; mismatch prevents activation. Not suitable.\n- D. ICD: `Gal4-VP64` | Promoter: UAS - $P_{\\text{min}}$. Gal4 targets UAS, and VP64 activates transcription at $P_{\\text{min}}$. This yields RFP expression only upon synNotch activation. Suitable.\n- E. ICD: `Gal4` | Promoter: `LexA` operator - $P_{\\text{min}}$. Gal4 does not bind the `LexA` operator, and Gal4 without an activation domain would not robustly activate $P_{\\text{min}}$. Not suitable.\n\nTherefore, the only combination that ensures RFP is produced only upon receptor activation is ICD `Gal4-VP64` with the UAS - $P_{\\text{min}}$ promoter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2073136"}, {"introduction": "A successful design on paper does not always guarantee a working system inside a living cell, making troubleshooting a critical skill for any synthetic biologist. This exercise presents a common experimental hurdle: a synNotch circuit that fails to produce its output despite evidence of initial activation. By analyzing the provided data, you'll learn to diagnose a circuit failure, moving beyond the schematic to consider crucial underlying biological processes like protein transport that dictate function in a eukaryotic context [@problem_id:2073115].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a researcher designs a circuit in a mammalian cell line using a synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptor system. The goal is for the cell to detect a specific ligand on a \"sender\" cell and respond by expressing a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter.\n\nThe engineered synNotch receptor has three main parts:\n1.  An extracellular domain that specifically binds to the target ligand.\n2.  A transmembrane domain that anchors the receptor in the cell membrane.\n3.  An intracellular domain (ICD) that consists of a custom-designed synthetic transcription factor (TF).\n\nThe signaling pathway is designed as follows: Upon ligand binding, the synNotch receptor undergoes a conformational change that exposes a cleavage site. Intracellular proteases then cleave the receptor, releasing the ICD (the synthetic TF) into the cytoplasm. This TF is supposed to travel to the nucleus, bind to a specific promoter sequence, and activate the transcription of the GFP gene.\n\nThe researcher observes that when the engineered cells are co-cultured with the sender cells, the synNotch receptor is successfully cleaved. This is confirmed by a Western blot analysis showing the presence of the released ICD fragment in the cytoplasmic lysate. However, no GFP expression is detected via fluorescence microscopy.\n\nAssuming the reporter gene construct (promoter and GFP gene) is free of errors, which of the following options presents the most direct and primary reason related to the properties of the synthetic transcription factor that could explain this failure?\n\nA. The extracellular domain of the synNotch receptor has a low affinity for the sender cell's ligand, preventing receptor activation.\n\nB. The synthetic transcription factor was designed using a DNA-binding domain that is incompatible with the promoter sequence of the reporter gene.\n\nC. The amino acid sequence of the synthetic transcription factor lacks a functional Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS).\n\nD. The cell line used in the experiment does not express the specific proteases required to cleave the synNotch receptor.\n\nE. The synthetic transcription factor is too large to be translated efficiently by the cell's ribosomes.", "solution": "We analyze the causal chain required for GFP expression with a synNotch-synthetic transcription factor (TF) system and use established cell biology principles to exclude options that contradict the provided observations.\n\n1. Receptor activation and proteolysis:\n- Observation: A Western blot detects the released intracellular domain (ICD) in the cytoplasmic lysate after co-culture with sender cells.\n- Principle: Detection of the cleaved ICD indicates successful ligand-induced activation of synNotch and the presence of the necessary proteolytic activity.\n- Implication: This directly rules out A (insufficient ligand binding leading to no activation) and D (absence of required proteases), since cleavage demonstrably occurred.\n\n2. Requirement for transcriptional activation:\n- Principle: For transcriptional activation of the GFP reporter, the TF must (i) enter the nucleus and (ii) bind the cognate promoter sequence to recruit transcriptional machinery.\n- Nuclear import requirement: Proteins larger than the passive diffusion threshold require a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) to be recognized by importins for active transport through the nuclear pore complex. A TF lacking a functional NLS remains in the cytoplasm and cannot access chromatin to drive transcription.\n- Observation alignment: The ICD is detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, and no GFP expression is observed. If the TF lacks an NLS, it would be retained in the cytoplasm and fail to activate transcription even if the DNA-binding specificity were otherwise correct.\n- Therefore, a missing or nonfunctional NLS in the synthetic TF provides a direct and primary mechanistic explanation for the failure.\n\n3. Alternative TF property: DNA-binding domain compatibility:\n- Option B suggests the TF’s DNA-binding domain does not match the promoter sequence. While this would prevent transcription if the TF reached the nucleus, the problem states the reporter construct (promoter and GFP gene) is free of errors, implying correct design and sequence fidelity for the intended TF-promoter pair. Although “free of errors” does not logically guarantee matched specificity, the presence of the ICD in the cytoplasm specifically highlights nuclear import as the immediate bottleneck, making B less direct than a nuclear localization defect.\n\n4. Translation efficiency concern:\n- Option E is inconsistent with observed receptor expression and cleavage, which require successful translation of the receptor-TF fusion protein.\n\nGiven these points, the most direct and primary TF-related reason consistent with the data is the absence of a functional NLS in the synthetic TF, preventing nuclear entry and thereby blocking GFP transcription despite successful receptor activation and ICD release.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2073115"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple ON/OFF switches, this advanced practice explores the true power of synNotch receptors in engineering sophisticated cellular logic. Your task is to design a \"neighbor-counting\" cell that can distinguish between low, medium, and high cell densities and report each state with a unique fluorescent protein. Success requires integrating the core synNotch mechanism with more complex genetic circuit motifs, like cross-repression, to generate a precise, multi-tiered cellular response from a simple input gradient [@problem_id:2073113].", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team aims to engineer a cell line that can sense the density of its local environment and report it using three distinct colors.

A \"receiver\" cell line that constitutively expresses a synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptor.\n2.  A \"sender\" cell line that expresses the corresponding ligand on its surface.\n3.  Upon binding of the synNotch receptor to the ligand on a neighboring sender cell, the receptor is cleaved, releasing a single type of synthetic Transcription Factor, which we will call `TF_A`. The intracellular concentration of active `TF_A` is assumed to be directly proportional to the number of sender cells in contact with the receiver cell.\n4.  Genes for the three reporters: `gfp`, `yfp`, and `rfp`.\n5.  The ability to design synthetic promoters that can be activated by `TF_A`. The sensitivity and response of these promoters can be tuned. A promoter with a single binding site for `TF_A` will have a high sensitivity (low activation threshold).

The ability to create synthetic repressor proteins (`TF_Rep`) and design promoters that are repressed by them. Repressors can be expressed as part of the same transcript as a reporter gene.\n\nWhich of the following genetic circuit designs, when engineered into the receiver cell, would most effectively achieve the desired three-tiered, exclusive reporting of neighbor density (i.e., green for low, yellow for medium, red for high)?\n\nA. The circuit consists of three modules.\n    - Promoter `P1` has a single, high-affinity binding site for `TF_A` and drives the expression of `gfp`.\n    - Promoter `P2` has multiple cooperative binding sites for `TF_A`, giving it a medium activation threshold. It drives the expression of both `yfp` and a repressor `TF_Rep1`. `TF_Rep1` is designed to repress `P1`.\n    - Promoter `P3` has a higher number of cooperative binding sites for `TF_A`, giving it a high activation threshold. It drives the expression of both `rfp` and a repressor `TF_Rep2`. `TF_Rep2` is designed to repress `P2`.\n\nB. The circuit consists of three independent modules.\n    - Promoter `P1` has a single binding site for `TF_A` and drives `gfp`.\n    - Promoter `P2` has two binding sites for `TF_A` and drives `yfp`.\n    - Promoter `P3` has four binding sites for `TF_A` and drives `rfp`.\n    - There is no cross-regulation or repression between these three modules.\n\nC. The circuit uses an inverted repression cascade.\n    - Promoter `P1` has a single binding site for `TF_A`. It drives expression of both `gfp` and a repressor `TF_Rep1` that targets `P2`.\n    - Promoter `P2` has multiple cooperative binding sites for `TF_A`. It drives expression of both `yfp` and a repressor `TF_Rep2` that targets `P3`.\n    - Promoter `P3` has a very high number of cooperative binding sites for `TF_A` and drives the expression of `rfp`.\n\nD. The circuit relies on varying protein production rates.\n    - Three identical promoters (`P1`, `P2`, `P3`), all with a single `TF_A` binding site, are used.\n    - `P1` drives the `gfp` gene, `P2` drives the `yfp` gene, and `P3` drives the `rfp` gene.\n    - The desired behavior is achieved by integrating a different number of copies of each reporter gene into the genome (e.g., 20 copies of `gfp`, 5 copies of `yfp`, and 1 copy of `rfp`).", "solution": "Let the number of contacting sender neighbors be $n$ and the intracellular concentration of active transcription factor be $c = \\alpha n$, with proportionality constant $\\alpha$. Each promoter’s activation by $\\text{TF}_{\\text{A}}$ is modeled by a Hill function\n$$\nf_{i}(c)=\\frac{c^{h_{i}}}{K_{i}^{h_{i}}+c^{h_{i}}},\n$$\nwhere $K_{i}$ is the activation threshold and $h_{i}$ is the Hill coefficient reflecting cooperativity (single site: $h_{i}=1$; multiple cooperative sites: $h_{i}>1$ and sharper transitions). Repression by a repressor $R$ acting on promoter $P$ is modeled multiplicatively with a repression term\n$$\ng(R)=\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{R}{K_{R}}\\right)^{m}},\n$$\nwhere $K_{R}$ is the repression constant and $m$ is the cooperativity of repression. Reporter output from a promoter under activation by $\\text{TF}_{\\text{A}}$ and repression by a repressor thus follows\n$$\n\\text{Output}\\propto f_{i}(c)\\,g(R).\n$$\n\nWe seek three exclusive regimes in $c$ (equivalently $n$): low $c$ yields only GFP, medium $c$ yields only YFP, and high $c$ yields only RFP. This requires (i) staggered activation thresholds $K_1 < K_2 < K_3$ with increasing $h_i$ to sharpen transitions, and (ii) cross-repression to actively silence lower-tier outputs once a higher-tier turns on, preventing overlaps inherent to graded activation.\n\nAnalysis of designs:\n- Design A implements hierarchical activation with feedforward cross-repression. Choose $K_1 < K_2 < K_3$ with $h_1 = 1$, $h_2 > 1$, $h_3 > 1$ sufficiently large for switch-like responses.\n  • Low $c$: $f_1(c) \\approx 1$, $f_2(c) \\approx 0$, $f_3(c) \\approx 0$. No repressors are produced, so $g(\\cdot) \\approx 1$ for all. Result: GFP on, YFP off, RFP off.\n  • Medium $c$: $f_2(c)$ crosses its threshold, producing YFP and $\\text{TF}_{\\text{Rep1}}$. Then $g_{P1}(\\text{TF}_{\\text{Rep1}}) \\ll 1$, so $P_1$ is repressed even though $f_1(c)$ remains high. With $f_3(c) \\approx 0$ still, result: GFP off, YFP on, RFP off.\n  • High $c$: $f_3(c)$ crosses its threshold, producing RFP and $\\text{TF}_{\\text{Rep2}}$, which yields $g_{P2}(\\text{TF}_{\\text{Rep2}}) \\ll 1$, turning off $P_2$. Since $P_2$ off reduces $\\text{TF}_{\\text{Rep1}}$, one can ensure $P_1$ remains off either via residual $\\text{TF}_{\\text{Rep1}}$ and/or by designing $P_3$ to also encode repression of $P_1$ if needed; however, in the given A design, $P_1$ remains off because $\\text{TF}_{\\text{Rep1}}$ is present across the medium-to-high regime until $P_3$ dominates. With appropriate repressor strength and degradation tuning, steady state at high $c$ is RFP only. Thus A achieves exclusive tiered outputs through thresholding plus feedforward repression that silences lower tiers upon activation of a higher tier.\n\n- Design B uses independent Hill activations with no cross-regulation. With $K_1 < K_2 < K_3$ and $h_1 \\le h_2 \\le h_3$, the functions $f_1(c)$, $f_2(c)$, and $f_3(c)$ inevitably overlap in $c$, causing co-expression near thresholds; without repression terms $g(\\cdot)$ to enforce exclusivity, one cannot prevent green-yellow or yellow-red overlaps.\n\n- Design C makes $P_1$ repress $P_2$, and $P_2$ repress $P_3$, but does not include repression of $P_1$ by higher tiers. Since $P_1$ has the lowest threshold, $f_1(c)$ remains high for medium and high $c$. Thus $\\text{TF}_{\\text{Rep1}}$ persists and $g_{P2}(\\text{TF}_{\\text{Rep1}}) \\ll 1$, suppressing $P_2$ across the very ranges where $P_2$ must be active. This blocks progression to the yellow and red states or requires repression so weak that exclusivity fails. Therefore C is not robust for the desired tiered exclusivity.\n\n- Design D uses identical promoters with identical thresholds and varies only gene copy number. Since activation thresholds are equal, once $c$ crosses that threshold, all three reporters express with different amplitudes, not exclusive states. Below threshold, all off; above threshold, all on to varying degrees. This cannot produce three distinct, exclusive tiers.\n\nTherefore, only Design A combines staggered activation thresholds with feedforward cross-repression to enforce clean, exclusive state transitions: GFP only at low $c$, YFP only at medium $c$, and RFP only at high $c$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2073113"}]}
