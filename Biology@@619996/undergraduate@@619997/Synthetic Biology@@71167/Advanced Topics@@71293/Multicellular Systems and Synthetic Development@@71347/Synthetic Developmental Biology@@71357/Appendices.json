The goal is to create a cell line that differentiates into a specific cell type, a \"reporter cell,\" if and only if it detects the presence of *either* of two distinct pollutant molecules, Pollutant Alpha ($\\alpha$) or Pollutant Beta ($\\beta$), in its culture medium.\n\nTo achieve this, the team has access to a pre-engineered host cell line and a library of genetic parts.\n\n**Host Cell Sensing System:**\nThe host stem cell is equipped with two independent, built-in sensing pathways:\n1.  The presence of Pollutant $\\alpha$ causes the activation of an endogenous, otherwise inactive, Transcription Factor A (`TF_A`).\n2.  The presence of Pollutant $\\beta$ causes the activation of a second endogenous Transcription Factor B (`TF_B`).\n\n**Available Genetic Parts Library:**\nThe team can assemble the following DNA parts into one or more plasmids (constructs) to transfect into the host cells.\n*   `P_A`: A synthetic promoter that is activated to initiate transcription exclusively by `TF_A`.\n*   `P_B`: A synthetic promoter that is activated to initiate transcription exclusively by `TF_B`.\n*   `gene_C`: A gene that encodes a synthetic Transcription Factor C (`TF_C`).\n*   `P_C`: A synthetic promoter that is activated to initiate transcription exclusively by `TF_C`.\n*   `gene_D`: A gene encoding the \"Differentiation\" master regulator protein (`Diff`). The expression of `Diff` is sufficient to trigger the irreversible differentiation of the stem cell into the desired reporter cell.\n\n**Assumptions and Notation:**\n*   All promoters have zero basal (\"leaky\") expression. They are completely off in the absence of their specific activator.\n*   All transcription factors become functional immediately after they are synthesized.\n*   The notation `P_X -> gene_Y` represents a genetic construct where the promoter `P_X` is placed upstream of the gene `Y`, such that the activation of `P_X` drives the expression of `gene_Y`.\n\nWhich of the following sets of constructs, when introduced into the host stem cells, will correctly program the cells to differentiate upon sensing Pollutant $\\alpha$ or Pollutant $\\beta$?\n\nA.

The core of this system is a synthetic genetic counter that relies on the dilution of a repressor protein during cell division.\n\nThe circuit is designed as follows:\n1.  At time $t=0$ (Generation 0), a brief pulse of an external inducer molecule triggers the synthesis of a stable repressor protein, RepA, establishing a uniform initial intracellular concentration of $C_0$. Immediately after this pulse, the gene for RepA is permanently silenced, and no further production of RepA occurs.\n2.  The RepA protein is exceptionally stable, so its degradation is negligible over the course of the experiment. Its concentration within a cell lineage decreases only through dilution. Assume that each cell division is perfectly symmetric, halving the cytoplasmic content, and thus halving the concentration of RepA in each of the two daughter cells.\n3.  The RepA protein acts as a repressor for a promoter, $P_{out}$. This promoter controls the expression of a gene cassette that, when expressed, halts cell division and initiates a differentiation program.\n4.
