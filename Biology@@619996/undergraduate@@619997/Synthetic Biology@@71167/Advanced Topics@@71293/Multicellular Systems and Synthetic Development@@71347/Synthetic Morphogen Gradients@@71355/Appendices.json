This first exercise grounds you in the fundamental principles of morphogen gradient formation using a classic one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model. By manipulating the morphogen production rate, you will explore how the key characteristics of a gradient—its amplitude ($C_0$) and characteristic length ($\\lambda$)—are determined by the underlying physical parameters of production, diffusion, and degradation. This practice is essential for building an intuition for how to tune and control synthetic patterns at the most basic level [@problem_id:2072847].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a one-dimensional colony of cells is engineered to study pattern formation. A single \"source\" cell, located at position $x=0$, is designed to produce a signaling molecule that acts as a morphogen. This molecule diffuses away from the source and is uniformly degraded by all cells in the colony.\n\nThe steady-state concentration profile of the morphogen, $C(x)$, for $x \\ge 0$ is well-described by the solution to a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model. The concentration decays exponentially from the source according to the function:\n$$C(x) = C_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nHere, $C_0$ is the amplitude of the gradient (the concentration at the source, $x=0$), and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic spatial extent of the gradient.\n\nThese two parameters are determined by the underlying physical properties of the system: the production rate of the morphogen at the source, $P$; the effective diffusion coefficient of the morphogen, $D$; and the first-order degradation rate constant of the morphogen, $k$.

This advanced problem moves from simply creating a gradient to using it for programming a lasting cellular response, which lies at the heart of developmental biology and synthetic morphogenesis. You will analyze a system where receiver cells are equipped with a synthetic gene circuit that acts as a memory switch, exhibiting bistability and hysteresis. This exercise beautifully demonstrates how a transient spatial signal can be translated into a permanent, imprinted pattern of gene expression, providing a powerful mechanism for building stable biological structures [@problem_id:2072867].", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is designing a system for developmental patterning. They have engineered a one-dimensional line of cells arranged along the $z$-axis for $z \\ge 0$.

The circuit is designed to function as a memory switch. For this memory function to be possible, the parameters must satisfy the condition $\\beta  \\sqrt{3} \\gamma K$, which you can assume to be true. Under this condition, if a high enough concentration of $S$ drives $P$ to a 'high' expression state, the cell will remain in a stable 'high' state even after the morphogen $S$ is completely removed. Initially, at $t=0$, all cells are in the 'low' expression state, where $P \\approx 0$.\n\nTo create a pattern, a transient morphogen gradient is applied. The morphogen concentration at position $z$ and time $t$ is given by $S(z, t) = S_{\\max}(t) \\exp(-z/\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the characteristic decay length of the gradient. The amplitude of the gradient, $S_{\\max}(t)$, is ramped up linearly from $0$ to a peak value of $S_0$ over a time interval $T$, and then ramped down linearly back to $0$ over an equal interval, such that:\n-   $S_{\\max}(t) = S_0 (t/T)$ for $0 \\le t \\le T$\n-   $S_{\\max}(t) = S_0 (2 - t/T)$ for $T  t \\le 2T$\n-   $S_{\\max}(t) = 0$ for $t  2T$\n\nThe process is carried out slowly, meaning the timescale $T$ is much longer than the intrinsic timescale of the gene circuit ($1/\\gamma$).
