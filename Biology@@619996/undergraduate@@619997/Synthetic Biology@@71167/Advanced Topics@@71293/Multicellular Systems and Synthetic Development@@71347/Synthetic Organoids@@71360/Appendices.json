This exercise [@problem_id:2073361] challenges you to design a simple but effective genetic reporter circuit, focusing on how to choose the correct molecular parts to link cellular identity with a fluorescent signal. The core principle you will apply is the use of a cell-type-specific promoter to drive targeted gene expression.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology laboratory, a research team is developing cardiac organoids from induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs). A critical part of their workflow is to monitor the efficiency of differentiation, a process where iPSCs mature into specialized heart muscle cells called cardiomyocytes. To achieve this, they aim to engineer a genetic circuit that will cause only the successfully differentiated cardiomyocytes to produce a visible signal.\n\nYou are tasked with selecting the most appropriate design for this reporter circuit. The circuit will be delivered into the iPSCs before the differentiation process begins. The desired outcome is for successfully formed cardiomyocytes to fluoresce green, while the initial iPSCs and any other cell types remain non-fluorescent.\n\nYou are provided with the following biological components and their characteristics:\n- **`pTNNT2`**: The promoter for the cardiac Troponin T gene (`TNNT2`). This gene is a well-established marker for mature cardiomyocytes and is transcriptionally active almost exclusively in this cell type.\n- **`pOCT4`**: The promoter for the `OCT4` gene, a key transcription factor that maintains pluripotency. This promoter is highly active in iPSCs but is silenced upon successful differentiation.\n- **`pCMV`**: A strong constitutive promoter derived from the Cytomegalovirus (CMV). It is considered \"always on,\" driving high levels of gene expression in a wide variety of mammalian cell types, including both iPSCs and cardiomyocytes.\n- **`GFP`**: The coding sequence for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a protein that emits green light when illuminated with blue light.\n- **`NeoR`**: The coding sequence for a neomycin resistance protein, which allows cells to survive in the presence of the antibiotic neomycin.\n\nWhich of the following genetic constructs is the most effective and direct design for making only mature cardiomyocytes fluoresce green?\n\nA. A construct where the `pTNNT2` promoter drives the expression of the `GFP` gene.\n\nB. A construct where the constitutive `pCMV` promoter drives the expression of the `GFP` gene.\n\nC. A construct where the `pOCT4` promoter drives the expression of the `GFP` gene.\n\nD. A construct where the `pTNNT2` promoter drives the expression of the `NeoR` gene.\n\nE. A construct where the `pCMV` promoter drives the expression of the `TNNT2` gene.", "solution": "Goal: Introduce a reporter construct into iPSCs before differentiation such that only successfully differentiated mature cardiomyocytes express a visible green signal. The design must rely on cell-type-specific transcriptional control to ensure that GFP is expressed exclusively in cardiomyocytes and remains off in iPSCs and other non-cardiomyocyte lineages.\n\nPrinciple: Gene expression is driven by promoter activity. A promoter that is active only in the desired cell type will transcriptionally restrict reporter expression to that cell type. Conversely, a constitutive promoter drives expression in all cells, and a pluripotency-specific promoter drives expression in undifferentiated cells, both of which fail the specificity requirement. A reporter must directly place GFP under the control of a cell-type-specific promoter to produce the desired fluorescence pattern.\n\nEvaluate each option by expected promoter activity pattern:\n\n1) Option A: pTNNT2 → GFP.\n- pTNNT2 is active almost exclusively in mature cardiomyocytes.\n- In iPSCs and non-cardiomyocytes, pTNNT2 is inactive, so GFP is not transcribed.\n- In mature cardiomyocytes, pTNNT2 is active, so GFP is transcribed and cells fluoresce green.\n- This directly implements the desired logic: only mature cardiomyocytes fluoresce.\n\n2) Option B: pCMV → GFP.\n- pCMV is constitutively active in a wide range of mammalian cells, including iPSCs and cardiomyocytes.\n- This yields GFP expression in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells, violating the requirement for specificity. Therefore, it will not restrict fluorescence to cardiomyocytes.\n\n3) Option C: pOCT4 → GFP.\n- pOCT4 is active in iPSCs and silenced upon successful differentiation.\n- This design inverts the desired pattern: undifferentiated iPSCs would fluoresce, while mature cardiomyocytes would not.\n\n4) Option D: pTNNT2 → NeoR.\n- While pTNNT2 specificity is suitable for cardiomyocytes, NeoR confers antibiotic resistance and does not produce green fluorescence.\n- This is not a fluorescent reporter for cardiomyocytes and therefore does not meet the stated outcome, even though it could, in principle, be used for selection.\n\n5) Option E: pCMV → TNNT2.\n- This forces expression of a cardiomyocyte marker gene broadly, which is not a reporter design and risks ectopic expression that could perturb cell fate.\n- It does not implement selective GFP fluorescence in mature cardiomyocytes.\n\nConclusion: The only construct that directly and specifically causes mature cardiomyocytes to fluoresce green, while keeping iPSCs and other cell types non-fluorescent, is the design where pTNNT2 drives GFP expression.\n\nTherefore, the most effective and direct design is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2073361"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply observing cell fates, synthetic biology aims to actively control them. The development of an organoid often depends on the precise expression level of key regulatory genes—too much or too little can lead to failure. This practice [@problem_id:2073396] explores how to build a tunable \"dial\" for a critical gene using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), a powerful modern technique. You will need to think critically about the design of an inducible system to achieve robust and fine-grained control over gene expression.", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is developing a protocol to grow liver organoids from human pluripotent stem cells. A critical step in the early differentiation process is the precise regulation of a transcription factor, let's call it Hepatic Patterning Factor 1 (HPF1). Overexpression of the *HPF1* gene leads to aberrant, tumor-like growth, while underexpression results in failed differentiation. The team's goal is to create a \"tunable dial\" for *HPF1* expression, allowing them to dynamically adjust its level during organoid development. They decide to use a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system. A CRISPRi system consists of a catalytically \"dead\" Cas9 protein (dCas9), which can bind to DNA but cannot cut it, and a guide RNA (gRNA) that directs the dCas9 to a specific target sequence. When the dCas9-gRNA complex binds to a gene's promoter region, it physically blocks transcription, thereby reducing the gene's expression.\n\nThe team has access to standard molecular biology tools, including plasmids, constitutive promoters (which are always \"on\"), and inducible promoters that can be activated by adding a specific small molecule to the cell culture medium. For this project, they have a tetracycline-inducible system, where gene expression can be turned on and controlled by the concentration of the antibiotic doxycycline.\n\nGiven the goal of creating a finely tunable system to control the expression level of the endogenous *HPF1* gene in the stem cells, which of the following strategies represents the most effective and robust design?\n\nA. Engineer the cells to express both dCas9 and a gRNA targeting the *HPF1* promoter from a single, strong constitutive promoter.\n\nB. Engineer the cells to express a nuclease-active, wild-type Cas9 protein and a gRNA targeting a critical exon within the *HPF1* gene's coding sequence.\n\nC.

Repression strength at the promoter depends on the occupancy of the promoter by the dCas9–gRNA complex, which is governed by the concentration of functional complexes and their binding affinity to the target site. Fine control is obtained by modulating the amount of active dCas9–gRNA complexes.\n\nDesign constraints for tunability:\n1) The component under inducible control should provide fast, graded, and low-leak modulation of active complex levels.\n2) dCas9 is a large, relatively stable protein with slow accumulation and clearance dynamics; placing it under induction can produce delayed responses, higher basal leak effects due to protein stability, and threshold-like behavior rather than smooth titration.\n3) gRNA is small and typically turns over more rapidly; inducible control of gRNA allows rapid, graded, and reversible changes in the number of dCas9–gRNA complexes given a constitutive pool of dCas9, minimizing background because dCas9 without gRNA does not bind target DNA specifically.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Constitutive co-expression of dCas9 and gRNA from a strong promoter yields maximal, non-tunable repression. This fails the fine-tuning requirement and risks underexpression.\n- B: Wild-type Cas9 targeting a coding exon will introduce double-strand breaks, leading to permanent edits and loss-of-function outcomes. This is not reversible or tunable and is inconsistent with CRISPRi.\n- C: Constitutive dCas9 with gRNA under tetracycline-inducible control allows precise, dose-dependent tuning of active complexes by adjusting doxycycline concentration. This design gives rapid, reversible modulation with low basal repression in the absence of inducer, meeting robustness and tunability goals.\n- D: Constitutive gRNA with inducible dCas9 places the slower, stable component under induction, often resulting in slower kinetics, potential leaky repression due to residual dCas9, and less linear titration; thus less optimal than C.\n- E: Promoter replacement with a tetracycline-inducible promoter can enable tunability but is invasive, permanently rewires the locus, can disrupt native regulatory context, and is not a CRISPRi approach as specified in the setup.\n\nConclusion: The most effective and robust CRISPRi design for fine tuning is to express dCas9 constitutively and place the gRNA under tetracycline-inducible control.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2073396"}, {"introduction": "Advanced synthetic circuits can implement logic and memory, allowing cells to respond to the history of signals they have received.

Once flipped, the state is designed to be permanent.\n\nThe toggle switch consists of two mutually repressing genes:\n1.  **Gene T**: Encodes the TetR repressor protein. The expression of this gene is repressed by the LacI protein.\n2.  **Gene L**: Encodes the LacI repressor protein. The expression of this gene is repressed by the TetR protein. A Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene is placed under the same promoter, so its expression is coupled with LacI. The \"ON\" state corresponds to high LacI and GFP concentrations.\n\nThe steady-state behavior of the repressors can be modeled using Hill functions.

To flip the switch to the \"ON\" state, aTc is added. The flip becomes irreversible once the concentration of LacI produced is sufficient to permanently suppress TetR production.
