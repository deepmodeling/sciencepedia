The colony grows to a uniform circular disk of radius $R$. The goal is to create a glowing ring by having the bacteria express a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) only within a specific annular region.\n\nThe expression of GFP is controlled by a genetic \"AND\" gate, meaning that the gene for GFP is transcribed only when two conditions are met simultaneously. These conditions depend on the local concentrations of two different molecules: an internal signaling molecule, `A`, and an external nutrient, `N`.\n\n1.  **Molecule A**: This molecule is produced by the bacteria and diffuses outwards from the center of the colony. Its steady-state concentration, $C_A(r)$, at a radial distance $r$ from the colony's center is modeled by the linear function:\n    $$C_A(r) = C_{A,0} \\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right)$$\n    where $C_{A,0}$ is the concentration at the center ($r=0$). The first condition for GFP expression is that the local concentration of `A` must exceed a threshold value $K_A$.\n\n2.  **Nutrient N**: This nutrient is supplied from the growth medium at the edge of the colony and diffuses inwards, being consumed by the cells along the way.

By solving for the optimal signal level [@problem_id:2069394], you will see how this circuit can implement complex logic, such as an XOR gate, enabling a population of cells to function as a simple but powerful cellular automaton.", "problem": "Synthetic biologists aim to engineer collective behaviors in cell populations by designing genetic circuits that process local information. Consider a one-dimensional filament of engineered cells designed to function as a simple Cellular Automaton (CA), where each cell's state in the next time step is determined by the present states of its immediate neighbors.\n\nThe state of a cell is defined by its fluorescence: ON (fluorescent) or OFF (non-fluorescent). A cell's circuit is designed to implement an \"exclusive OR\" (XOR) logic rule for its next state: a cell will turn ON if and only if exactly one of its two neighbors is currently ON. This behavior is achieved through a \"band-pass\" response to an input signal.\n\nAn ON cell emits a signal that is detected by its neighbors. The total input signal concentration, $S$, within a given cell is directly proportional to the number of its currently ON neighbors.

Therefore, we discard the negative root.\nThe optimal signal concentration $S_{opt}$ is:\n$$S_{opt} = \\sqrt{K_{A}K_{R}}$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we can check the sign of the second derivative or analyze the first derivative. The denominator of $\\frac{dY}{dS}$ is always positive. The numerator, $-S^{2} + K_{A}K_{R}$, is positive for $S < \\sqrt{K_{A}K_{R}}$ and negative for $S > \\sqrt{K_{A}K_{R}}$. This means $Y(S)$ is increasing before $S_{opt}$ and decreasing after $S_{opt}$, confirming that $S_{opt}$ is indeed a local maximum.

Each bacterium is equipped with a genetic toggle switch controlled by two mutually repressing proteins, U and V. A cell is defined to be in an 'ON' state when the concentration of protein U is high and V is low. Conversely, a cell is in an 'OFF' state when protein V is high and U is low.\n\n'ON' cells are engineered to produce a diffusible signaling molecule, S. This molecule can trigger adjacent 'OFF' cells to switch to the 'ON' state, allowing a pattern, once initiated by a transient local stimulus, to become stable and self-propagating. To make the pattern rewritable, a global chemical 'B' can be introduced to the system to erase the pattern by forcing all 'ON' cells to switch 'OFF'.\n\nThe dynamics of the toggle switch are approximated by a simplified model assuming very high cooperativity, where production rates behave as step functions:\n- The production rate of U is $P_U = \\alpha_U$ if the concentration of V, denoted $[V]$, is less than the repression threshold $K_V$. Otherwise, $P_U = 0$.\n- The production rate of V is $P_V = \\alpha_V$ if the concentration of U, denoted $[U]$, is less than the repression threshold $K_U$. Otherwise, $P_V = 0$.\n\nThe external molecules affect the protein degradation rates:\n- The global eraser 'B', at a uniform concentration $b$, enhances the degradation of protein U. The total degradation rate of U is $(\\delta_U + k_B b)$, where $\\delta_U$ is the basal degradation rate and $k_B$ is a constant of effectiveness.\n- The local signaling molecule 'S', at a local concentration $s$, enhances the degradation of protein V. The total degradation rate of V is $(\\delta_V + k_S s)$, where $\\delta_V$ is the basal degradation rate and $k_S$ is a constant.\n\nIn a steady state, the concentration of a protein is constant, meaning its production rate equals its degradation rate. For example, for protein U, $P_U - (\\delta_U + k_B b)[U] = 0$.\n\nConsider a stable, established pattern where a line of 'ON' cells is adjacent to 'OFF' cells.
