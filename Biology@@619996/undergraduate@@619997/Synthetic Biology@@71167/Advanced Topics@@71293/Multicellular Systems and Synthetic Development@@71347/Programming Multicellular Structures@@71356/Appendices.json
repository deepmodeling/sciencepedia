The goal is for the colony to automatically stop growing once it reaches a predetermined size. This control is implemented via a negative feedback circuit based on quorum sensing.\n\nConsider the following simplified model for the process:\n1.  The bacterial colony maintains a perfect spherical shape with radius $R$ and a constant, uniform cell density $n_v$ (cells per unit volume).\n2.  Each bacterium within the colony produces a signaling molecule, an Acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), at a constant rate $p$ (molecules per cell per unit time).\n3.  For this model, we assume the concentration of the AHL signal, $C$, is uniform throughout the colony's volume. The signal molecules are lost from the colony as they diffuse out through its surface. The total rate of AHL loss is proportional to the colony's surface area $A$ and the internal concentration $C$, governed by a signal export coefficient $k_{\\text{loss}}$ (with units of velocity).\n4.  The bacteria have a maximum cell division rate $k_{\\text{div,max}}$ which occurs in the absence of the AHL signal. The bacteria also experience a constant cell death rate $k_{\\text{death}}$.\n5.  The AHL signal inhibits cell division. The effective division rate, $k_{\\text{div,eff}}$, is given by the inhibitory function:\n    $$k_{\\text{div,eff}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{div,max}}}{1 + C/K_I}$$\n    where $K_I$ is the inhibition constant, representing the AHL concentration at which the effective division rate is halved.\n6.  The colony's size is considered to be at equilibrium when its radius is constant. This occurs when the total rate of cell creation from division exactly balances the total rate of cell loss from death throughout the colony.\n\nAssuming that $k_{\\text{div,max}} > k_{\\text{death}}$, derive an expression for the equilibrium radius, $R_{\\text{eq}}$, of the colony.

This problem challenges you to design a \"biological wire\" capable of transmitting a signal unidirectionally along a line of cells, a key component for creating sophisticated spatial patterns. The core task is to devise a genetic circuit that induces a temporary \"refractory period\" in each cell after it fires, preventing backward signal propagation and forcing the information to flow in a single direction [@problem_id:2057961].", "id": "2057961", "problem": "In synthetic biology, designing multicellular systems that execute complex spatio--temporal programs is a major goal. A fundamental building block for such systems is a \"biological wire\" capable of transmitting a signal unidirectionally along a line of cells. Consider a one-dimensional array of engineered cells. Your task is to select a genetic circuit design that ensures a signal, once initiated, propagates sequentially from one cell to the next without propagating backward. This requires that after a cell activates and signals its downstream neighbor, it enters a temporary \"refractory\" state during which it is insensitive to re-activation by a signal from that downstream neighbor.\n\nAll cells are engineered with the following potential genetic components:\n- **`luxI`**: A gene encoding an enzyme that synthesizes a small, diffusible signaling molecule, Acyl-Homoserine Lactone (AHL).\n- **`luxR`**: A gene encoding a transcriptional activator protein, LuxR. In the presence of AHL, LuxR binds to it, forming an active complex `(AHL-LuxR)` that can activate specific promoters.\n- **`gfp`**: A gene encoding the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which makes the cell glow green when expressed, serving as a reporter of activation.\n- **`rep`**: A gene encoding a generic transcriptional repressor protein, Rep.\n- **Promoters and Operators**: DNA sequences that control gene expression. Promoters are sites where transcription is initiated, and operators are sites where repressors can bind to block transcription.\n\nAssume an initial signal comes from an external source activating only the first cell in the line. Assume all expressed proteins (LuxR, GFP, Rep) are unstable and are continuously degraded by the cell, meaning their presence is transient unless their corresponding genes are actively being expressed.\n\nWhich of the following circuit designs, when implemented in each cell, would achieve unidirectional signal propagation by inducing a temporary refractory state?\n\nA. A promoter, `P_out`, drives the expression of `luxI`, `gfp`, and `rep`. `P_out` is activated by the `(AHL-LuxR)` complex. A separate promoter, `P_receptor`, drives the expression of `luxR`. The `Rep` protein represses `P_receptor`.\n\nB. A promoter, `P_out`, drives the expression of `luxI`, `gfp`, and `rep`. `P_out` is activated by the `(AHL-LuxR)` complex. The `Rep` protein represses `P_out`. The `luxR` gene is constitutively expressed from a different promoter that is always active.\n\nC. A promoter, `P_out`, drives the expression of `luxI` and `gfp`. `P_out` is activated by the `(AHL-LuxR)` complex. There is no `rep` gene in this circuit.

The `luxR` gene is constitutively expressed.\n\n", "solution": "The goal is to design a circuit that propagates a signal forward (`cell n` -> `cell n+1`) but not backward (`cell n+1` -/> `cell n`). To achieve this, a cell that has just been activated (`cell n`) must become temporarily insensitive to the same signal (AHL) that it uses to activate its neighbor (`cell n+1`). This period of insensitivity is known as a refractory period. Let's analyze the behavior of each proposed circuit.\n\nThe core activation mechanism common to most options is: AHL from an upstream cell diffuses into the target cell, binds with the constitutively available LuxR protein, and the resulting `(AHL-LuxR)` complex activates the promoter `P_out`.\n\n**Analysis of Circuit A:**\n1.  **Activation:** An incoming AHL signal from `cell n-1` enters `cell n`. It binds to LuxR. The `(AHL-LuxR)` complex activates `P_out`.\n2.  **Response:** `cell n` begins to express `luxI` (producing AHL to signal `cell n+1`), `gfp` (glowing green), and `rep` (producing Rep protein).\n3.  **Refractory Mechanism:** The newly synthesized `Rep` protein begins to repress `P_receptor`, the promoter responsible for producing the LuxR receptor protein.\n4.  **Entering the Refractory State:** As `Rep` concentration increases, the production of new LuxR protein is shut down. Due to natural protein degradation, the total amount of LuxR in `cell n` decreases significantly. Without the LuxR receptor, the cell becomes insensitive to AHL.\n5.  **Preventing Backward Propagation:** When `cell n+1` becomes active, it releases AHL, some of which diffuses back to `cell n`. However, since `cell n` now has very little LuxR, this incoming AHL cannot trigger re-activation. The cell is refractory.\n6.  **Reset:** Eventually, the initial signal from `cell n-1` disappears. The `(AHL-LuxR)` complex concentration drops, and `P_out` activity ceases. Production of `Rep` stops. The existing `Rep` protein degrades, lifting the repression on `P_receptor`. The cell then resumes production of LuxR and returns to its initial, sensitive state, ready for a potential future signal wave.\nThis circuit correctly implements a temporary refractory state by targeting the cell's ability to sense the signal, thus ensuring unidirectional propagation.\n\n**Analysis of Circuit B:**\nIn this design, the `Rep` protein represses `P_out`, the same promoter it is expressed from. This is a negative feedback loop on the output. When `(AHL-LuxR)` activates `P_out`, the cell produces `luxI`, `gfp`, and `Rep`. The `Rep` protein then quickly shuts down `P_out`. This will create a pulse of output. However, the `luxR` gene is constitutively expressed. So, the cell always has LuxR protein and remains sensitive to AHL. If `cell n+1` sends AHL back to `cell n`, the `(AHL-LuxR)` complex will form and try to activate `P_out` again. While `Rep` might be present, a strong enough backward signal could still cause re-activation or at least a complex dynamic, but critically, the cell is not made insensitive to the input signal itself. The refractory mechanism is on the output, not the input sensitivity. This is less robust and does not guarantee a refractory state with respect to activation.\n\n**Analysis of Circuit C:**\nThis circuit lacks a `rep` gene and any negative feedback. `(AHL-LuxR)` activates `P_out`, leading to the production of more AHL (via LuxI) and GFP. This is a simple positive feedback loop. When `cell n` activates `cell n+1`, `cell n+1` will produce AHL that diffuses in all directions, including back to `cell n`. Since `cell n` is still fully sensitive, it will be re-activated, perpetuating the signal. This leads to bidirectional propagation and a \"latched\" ON state for all activated cells, not a transient wave.\n\n**Analysis of Circuit D:**\nHere, the `Rep` protein specifically represses the reporter gene `gfp`. Upon activation, the cell produces `luxI`, `gfp`, and `rep`. The `Rep` protein shuts down `gfp` expression. This means the cell will flash green only briefly. However, the production of `luxI` from `P_out` is unaffected by `Rep`. The cell remains fully sensitive to AHL (since `luxR` is constitutive) and fully capable of producing more AHL signal (`luxI` expression is not repressed). A backward signal from `cell n+1` would cause `cell n` to produce more AHL, even if it doesn't glow. This fails the primary goal of preventing backward signal propagation.\n\n**Analysis of Circuit E:**\nIn this circuit, `Rep` represses its own gene. This is a form of negative autoregulation. When `P_out` is activated, `Rep` is produced, which then reduces its own rate of production. This helps to stabilize the level of `Rep` protein, preventing it from accumulating too much. It does not, however, create a refractory period for the cell's sensitivity to external AHL. The cell's `LuxR` is always present, and the `luxI`/`gfp` outputs are not repressed. The cell remains sensitive to backward signals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly Circuit A correctly establishes a refractory period by temporarily removing the signal receptor (LuxR) after activation. This makes the cell \"blind\" to subsequent signals for a short time, effectively preventing backward propagation and ensuring the signal wave moves in one direction only.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}]}
