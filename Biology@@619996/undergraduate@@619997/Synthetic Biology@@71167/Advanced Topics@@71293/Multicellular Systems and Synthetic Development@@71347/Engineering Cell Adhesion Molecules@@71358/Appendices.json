{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in engineering cell adhesion is to understand the fundamental modes of interaction between cells. This practice challenges you to think like an experimentalist by designing a classic differential adhesion assay to distinguish between homophilic ('self-loving') and heterophilic ('other-loving') binding mechanisms. Mastering this logic is crucial for interpreting experimental data and verifying that your engineered proteins behave as designed.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project aiming to engineer self-assembling tissues, a researcher has created two distinct populations of non-adherent mammalian cells. The first population, Cell-A, has been engineered to express a novel surface protein called Adhesin-Alpha ($\\alpha$). The second population, Cell-B, has been engineered to express a different novel surface protein, Adhesin-Beta ($\\beta$). The researcher wants to determine if the adhesion mechanism between these proteins is homophilic or heterophilic. Homophilic adhesion occurs when a protein on one cell binds to an identical protein on another cell (e.g., $\\alpha$ binds to $\\alpha$). Heterophilic adhesion occurs when a protein on one cell binds to a different type of protein on another cell (e.g., $\\alpha$ binds to $\\beta$).\n\nTo test this, the researcher prepares three separate suspensions, each placed in a test tube and gently agitated to promote cell-cell interactions:\n- **Tube 1**: Contains only Cell-A.\n- **Tube 2**: Contains only Cell-B.\n- **Tube 3**: Contains an equal mixture of Cell-A and Cell-B.\n\nAfter a period of incubation, the tubes are observed for the formation of macroscopic cell aggregates. Which of the following outcomes would provide the most conclusive evidence that the interaction between Adhesin-Alpha and Adhesin-Beta is strictly heterophilic?\n\nA. Macroscopic aggregates form in Tube 1 and Tube 2, but not in Tube 3.\n\nB. Macroscopic aggregates form in Tube 1 and Tube 3, but not in Tube 2.\n\nC. Macroscopic aggregates form in all three tubes.\n\nD. Macroscopic aggregates form only in Tube 3.\n\nE. No macroscopic aggregates form in any of the tubes.", "solution": "To determine whether the interaction between Adhesin-Alpha ($\\alpha$) and Adhesin-Beta ($\\beta$) is strictly heterophilic, we analyze the expected aggregation outcomes under the assumption that only heterophilic binding occurs and that no homophilic binding is possible. By definition, strictly heterophilic adhesion means $\\alpha$ binds only to $\\beta$, and neither $\\alpha$ binds to $\\alpha$ nor $\\beta$ binds to $\\beta$.\n\nConsider each tube:\nTube 1 contains only Cell-A, which displays $\\alpha$ on all cells. Under strictly heterophilic adhesion, $\\alpha$ cannot bind to $\\alpha$, so no intercellular adhesion occurs, and no macroscopic aggregates are expected.\nTube 2 contains only Cell-B, which displays $\\beta$ on all cells. Under strictly heterophilic adhesion, $\\beta$ cannot bind to $\\beta$, so no intercellular adhesion occurs, and no macroscopic aggregates are expected.\nTube 3 contains a mixture of Cell-A and Cell-B, providing both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ on different cells. Under strictly heterophilic adhesion, $\\alpha$ on Cell-A can bind to $\\beta$ on Cell-B, enabling crosslinking between the two populations and producing macroscopic aggregates.\n\nTherefore, the outcome that most conclusively indicates strictly heterophilic interaction is that macroscopic aggregates form only in the mixed tube (Tube 3) and not in the single-population tubes (Tubes 1 and 2). Among the provided choices, this corresponds uniquely to option D.\n\nAlternative options are inconsistent: aggregation in Tubes 1 and 2 implies homophilic interactions; aggregation in all tubes suggests combined homo- and heterophilic interactions or nonspecific stickiness; absence of aggregation in all tubes suggests no effective adhesion under the tested conditions. Hence only D provides conclusive evidence for strictly heterophilic adhesion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2035216"}, {"introduction": "A successful adhesion protein must not only bind correctly but also be in the right place at the right time. This exercise [@problem_id:2035215] delves into the molecular architecture of a synthetic protein, focusing on the critical role of the transmembrane domain in anchoring it to the cell surface. By considering the consequences of deleting this domain, you will apply your knowledge of the cellular secretory pathway to predict a protein's ultimate fate and function.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a research team designs a synthetic cadherin-like protein, named SynCad-1, to induce specific adhesion between engineered mammalian cells. The wild-type SynCad-1 protein is composed of four distinct functional domains, listed in order from the N-terminus to the C-terminus:\n\n1.  A signal peptide that directs the protein to the secretory pathway.\n2.  An extracellular domain (EC) that mediates strong, calcium-dependent, homophilic (like-with-like) binding.\n3.  A single-pass transmembrane domain (TM) that anchors the protein in the cell's plasma membrane.\n4.  An intracellular domain (IC) fused to a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which allows for visualization and has no other known function in this context.\n\nA new variant of this protein, SynCad-1-ΔTM, is created by deleting the gene sequence that codes for the transmembrane (TM) domain. All other domains (signal peptide, EC, and IC-GFP) remain intact and are translated in their correct order.\n\nAssuming the SynCad-1-ΔTM protein is successfully expressed in a population of cells that also express the wild-type SynCad-1, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the final cellular localization and functional consequence of the SynCad-1-ΔTM protein?\n\nA. The protein will be found diffuse in the cytoplasm and will have no effect on cell adhesion.\n\nB. The protein will be correctly inserted into the plasma membrane and will enhance overall cell adhesion.\n\nC. The protein will be secreted from the cell into the extracellular medium and will act as a competitive inhibitor, reducing cell adhesion.\n\nD. The protein will become permanently trapped within the lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and will not affect cell adhesion.\n\nE. The protein will be misfolded due to the deletion and rapidly degraded by the proteasome, thus having no effect on the cells.", "solution": "1) Identify the targeting information and its consequence. The N-terminal signal peptide directs the nascent polypeptide to the secretory pathway via the signal recognition particle and co-translational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Signal peptidase cleaves the signal peptide in the ER membrane, after which the remaining polypeptide continues to translocate into the ER lumen unless a membrane-anchoring feature halts translocation.\n\n2) Determine the role of the transmembrane (TM) domain in wild type. In the wild-type SynCad-1, the single-pass TM domain functions as a stop-transfer/anchor sequence that retains the protein in the membrane, producing a type I topology with the N-terminus (extracellular domain) luminal/extracellular and the C-terminus (intracellular domain fused to GFP) cytosolic.\n\n3) Predict the effect of TM deletion on topology and localization. In SynCad-1-ΔTM, the TM domain is absent. After signal peptide–mediated entry into the ER and its cleavage, there is no stop-transfer/anchor sequence. Thus, the entire remaining polypeptide (EC plus IC-GFP) is fully translocated into the ER lumen, becoming a soluble luminal protein rather than a membrane protein.\n\n4) Determine the default trafficking fate. In the absence of an ER retention signal (such as a C-terminal KDEL or KKXX motif), soluble proteins in the ER lumen typically traffic anterograde through the Golgi and are secreted by the constitutive secretory pathway. Therefore, SynCad-1-ΔTM will be secreted into the extracellular space.\n\n5) Infer functional consequence based on domain function. The extracellular (EC) domain mediates strong, calcium-dependent homophilic binding. As a soluble, secreted ectodomain, SynCad-1-ΔTM can bind to the EC domains of membrane-anchored wild-type SynCad-1 molecules on cell surfaces. This constitutes competitive inhibition (a decoy effect), occupying binding sites and thereby reducing productive cell-cell adhesion mediated by membrane-anchored SynCad-1.\n\n6) Exclude alternative options. It will not be diffuse in the cytoplasm (signal peptide routes it to the ER), will not insert into the membrane without a TM domain, will not be permanently retained in the ER without a retention signal, and there is no basis to conclude obligatory misfolding and proteasomal degradation given intact signal peptide and secretory routing.\n\nConclusion: The SynCad-1-ΔTM variant will be secreted and function as a competitive inhibitor of adhesion, reducing overall cell-cell adhesion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2035215"}, {"introduction": "To engineer predictable, self-assembling tissues, we must be able to model the collective behavior of a cell population.
