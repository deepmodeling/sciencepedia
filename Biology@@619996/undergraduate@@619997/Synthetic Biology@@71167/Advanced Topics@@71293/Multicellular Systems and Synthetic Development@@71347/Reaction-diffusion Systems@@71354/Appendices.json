A fundamental question in cell biology is how long it takes for a molecule, like a transcription factor, to travel from where it's made to where it acts. This exercise will guide you through estimating this characteristic time using the principles of Brownian motion, providing a crucial intuition for the speed of intracellular communication.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a researcher designs a simple genetic circuit within a spherical bacterium. The circuit is designed to activate a gene located at the very center of the bacterium in response to an external chemical signal. When the signal molecule is introduced into the medium, a transcription factor protein is immediately produced at a point on the inner surface of the cell's membrane. For the gene to be activated, this transcription factor must diffuse through the cytoplasm and reach the cell's center.\n\nLet's model the bacterium as a perfect sphere of radius $R$. The motion of the transcription factor through the viscous cytoplasm can be described as three-dimensional Brownian motion, characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D$.\n\nBased on the physics of diffusion, provide a symbolic expression for the characteristic time, $t$, that it takes for the transcription factor to travel from its point of creation on the membrane to the center of the cell. Express your answer in terms of the given parameters $R$ and $D$.", "solution": "We model the transcription factor as undergoing three-dimensional Brownian motion with diffusion coefficient $D$. A standard result from the diffusion equation (or equivalently from the properties of Brownian motion) is that in $d$ spatial dimensions the mean squared displacement grows linearly with time as\n$$\n\\langle r^{2}(t) \\rangle = 2 d D t.\n$$\nFor $d=3$, this gives\n$$\n\\langle r^{2}(t) \\rangle = 6 D t.\n$$\nThe transcription factor is created at the inner surface of the spherical cell, a distance $R$ from the center, and must traverse a distance of order $R$ to reach the center. A characteristic diffusion time to cover this distance is obtained by equating the mean squared displacement to the squared distance,\n$$\nR^{2} \\sim \\langle r^{2}(t) \\rangle = 6 D t,\n$$\nand solving for $t$, which yields\n$$\nt = \\frac{R^{2}}{6 D}.\n$$\nThis expression has the correct dimensional form since $D$ has dimensions of length squared per time. Note that a precise mean first-passage time to a point target in three dimensions is not finite; however, for a finite-sized target at the center or for a characteristic time estimate, the above result provides the appropriate scaling and the standard prefactor for three-dimensional diffusion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{R^{2}}{6D}}$$.", "id": "2062615"}, {"introduction": "While diffusion spreads molecules out, many biological signals are simultaneously degraded.
