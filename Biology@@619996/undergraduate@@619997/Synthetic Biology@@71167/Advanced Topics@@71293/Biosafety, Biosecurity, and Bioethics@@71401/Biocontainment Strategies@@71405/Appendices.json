To prevent the uncontrolled spread of the organism, they must implement a biocontainment strategy based on auxotrophy. The engineered bacterium is designed to perform its function in a contained environment where specific nutrients can be supplied.\n\nTwo strategies are being considered:\n1.  **Single Auxotroph Strategy:** The *E. coli* is engineered to be unable to synthesize the amino acid tryptophan ($\\text{Trp}^-$). This is achieved by deleting a key gene in the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway.\n2.  **Dual Auxotroph Strategy:** The *E. coli* is engineered to be unable to synthesize both tryptophan ($\\text{Trp}^-$) and arginine ($\\text{Arg}^-$). This is achieved by deleting key genes in both respective biosynthetic pathways.\n\nThe reversion of an auxotrophic strain to prototrophy (the ability to synthesize the required nutrient) occurs due to spontaneous mutations. The probability of a single auxotrophic gene reverting to a functional state in any a given cell is given by $\\mu = 4.0 \\times 10^{-9}$. The biosynthetic pathways for tryptophan and arginine are metabolically distinct and the genes controlling them are located on distant parts of the bacterial chromosome. Therefore, the reversion events for the two pathways can be considered genetically independent.\n\nA large-scale bioreactor is inoculated and grows to a final population of $N = 2.5 \\times 10^{13}$ cells. Assuming this final population size, calculate the containment improvement factor, defined as the ratio of the expected number of escapee cells (revertants) in the single auxotroph system to the expected number of escapee cells in the dual auxotroph system.\n\nExpress your answer as a real number rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "We are given that the probability of reversion of a single auxotrophic gene in any given cell is $\\mu$, and that reversion events for tryptophan and arginine are independent.\n\nFor the single auxotroph strategy, a cell escapes if its single defective gene reverts.

The strategy is designed to ensure that any cell that loses its engineered plasmid will die.\n\nThe system is constructed as follows:\n1.  A toxin-encoding gene is integrated into the bacterium's chromosome. This results in the continuous production of a toxin protein, T, at a constant rate $P_T$ (concentration per unit time).\n2.  An antitoxin-encoding gene is placed on a plasmid. As long as the cell contains the plasmid, it produces an antitoxin protein, A, at a constant rate $P_A$.\n3.  Both the toxin and antitoxin proteins are cleared from the cell (through a combination of active degradation and dilution due to cell growth) at a rate proportional to their own concentration. The effective first-order rate constant for this removal process is $\\lambda$ for both proteins.\n4.  The antitoxin binds to the toxin in a 1:1 molar ratio, forming a harmless complex. This binding is assumed to be instantaneous. The cell remains viable only as long as the concentration of free, unbound toxin is below a critical lethal threshold, $C_{lethal}$.\n\nConsider a cell that is part of a culture that has been growing for a long time, allowing the intracellular concentrations of toxin and antitoxin to reach a steady state. The system is designed such that $P_A > P_T$, ensuring the viability of plasmid-containing cells. At time $t=0$, this cell divides, but one of the daughter cells fails to inherit the plasmid, ceasing all production of the antitoxin.\n\nAssuming that the steady-state concentration of the toxin produced from the chromosome is itself above the lethal threshold (i.e., $P_T / \\lambda > C_{lethal}$), derive a symbolic expression for the time, $t_{death}$, that elapses between the loss of the plasmid (at $t=0$) and the moment the concentration of free toxin reaches $C_{lethal}$.
