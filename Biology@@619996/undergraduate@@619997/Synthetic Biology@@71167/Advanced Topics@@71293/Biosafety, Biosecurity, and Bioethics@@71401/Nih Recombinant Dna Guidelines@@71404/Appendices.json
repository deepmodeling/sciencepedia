According to Section III-F of these guidelines, certain experiments are considered \"exempt\" because they present a very low risk to researchers and the environment. These exempt experiments do not require review and approval by an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) before initiation.\n\nYou are considering four different experiments, all of which will use the non-pathogenic, Risk Group 1 bacterium *Escherichia coli* strain K-12 as the host organism. Which of the following proposed experiments would **NOT** be considered exempt under Section III-F and would therefore require, at a minimum, registration with the IBC?\n\nA. An experiment to create a novel fusion protein by ligating the coding sequence of the *araB* gene to the coding sequence of the *phoA* gene, both of which are native to *E. coli* K-12. The resulting recombinant DNA construct will be expressed in an *E. coli* K-12 host.\n\nB. An experiment to express a gene coding for a fluorescent protein, isolated from the non-pathogenic jellyfish *Aequorea victoria* (a Risk Group 1 organism), in an *E. coli* K-12 host using a standard, certified non-conjugative plasmid vector.\n\nC. An experiment to clone and express a gene encoding a non-toxic structural protein that was isolated from the bacterium *Listeria monocytogenes*. *L. monocytogenes* is classified as a Risk Group 2 pathogen. The gene will be expressed in *E. coli* K-12.\n\nD. An experiment involving the expression of a synthetically constructed DNA molecule in an *E. coli* K-12 host. The sequence of this synthetic gene is designed to be identical to the native *E. coli* K-12 gene for beta-galactosidase (*lacZ*).", "solution": "I begin by identifying the controlling principle: NIH Guidelines Section III-F defines categories of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid research that are exempt from IBC review. In general, experiments are exempt if they (i) use non-pathogenic Risk Group 1 hosts, (ii) use well-characterized, non-conjugative vectors, and (iii) involve DNA segments that are either from a single non-pathogenic source or from Risk Group 1 sources, or are synthetic constructs that are identical to such sequences, and do not involve genes encoding toxins or traits that increase virulence or environmental spread. By contrast, cloning or expressing DNA from Risk Group 2 or higher organisms in any host is not exempt and requires IBC oversight.\n\nI now evaluate each proposed experiment against these criteria and Section III-F.\n\nFor option A, the coding sequences are both from Escherichia coli K-12, a Risk Group 1 organism, and the host is E. coli K-12. This falls under the exemption for constructs consisting entirely of DNA segments from a single non-pathogenic prokaryotic source propagated in that host or a closely related strain, and does not introduce pathogenic traits or mobilization. Therefore, this is exempt under Section III-F.\n\nFor option B, the gene originates from Aequorea victoria, a Risk Group 1 organism, and is expressed in E. coli K-12 using a standard certified non-conjugative plasmid. This aligns with Section III-F exemptions permitting introduction of non-toxic genes from Risk Group 1 organisms into a Risk Group 1 host using non-mobilizable vectors, as no pathogenicity or toxin functions are involved. Therefore, this is exempt under Section III-F.\n\nFor option C, the gene source is Listeria monocytogenes, a Risk Group 2 pathogen, even though the gene encodes a non-toxic structural protein. NIH Guidelines do not exempt experiments that clone or express DNA from Risk Group 2 (or higher) organisms into other hosts; such experiments fall outside Section III-F and require, at minimum, IBC registration and typically IBC review and approval prior to initiation. Therefore, this is not exempt.\n\nFor option D, the DNA is synthetically constructed but is designed to be identical to the native E. coli K-12 lacZ gene and is expressed in an E. coli K-12 host. Synthetic nucleic acids identical to sequences from a Risk Group 1 organism and expressed in a Risk Group 1 host, without features that increase risk (e.g., mobilization, toxin genes), meet the intent of the III-F exemptions. Therefore, this is exempt.\n\nFrom these evaluations, only option C does not qualify as exempt under Section III-F and would require IBC oversight.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2050698"}, {"introduction": "Modern synthetic biology often utilizes powerful tools, like viral vectors, which may be derived from pathogenic agents. This requires a nuanced risk assessment that considers not just the origin of the tool, but also the engineering controls that mitigate its danger. This case study focuses on a common example, a lentiviral vector, to build your skills in classifying research that involves these sophisticated molecular systems [@problem_id:2050711].", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team is designing an experiment to study gene expression in the human immune system. The plan is to use a third-generation, replication-incompetent lentiviral vector to deliver a gene into primary human T-cells cultured *in vitro*. The lentiviral vector system is derived from the Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1). The gene to be delivered encodes for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a non-toxic reporter protein with no known pathogenic activity. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, what is the appropriate Risk Group (RG) classification that dictates the minimum required biosafety containment level for conducting this experiment?\n\nA. RG1\n\nB. RG2\n\nC. RG3\n\nD. RG4\n\nE. Exempt from NIH Guidelines", "solution": "1) Identify the parental agent and its Risk Group under NIH Guidelines. The lentiviral vector system is derived from HIV-1. HIV-1 as an agent is classified as Risk Group 3 (RG3) because it is associated with serious or lethal human disease, although preventive or therapeutic interventions exist.\n\n2) Determine whether the derivative vector retains the RG of the parental agent. The system described is a third-generation, replication-incompetent lentiviral vector. In such systems, essential genes for replication are split across multiple plasmids and deleted from the transfer vector, and self-inactivating long terminal repeats are commonly used. This design prevents the production of replication-competent virus in the experimental setting, significantly reducing risk relative to the parental RG3 agent.\n\n3) Incorporate the nature of the transgene into the risk assessment. The transgene is GFP, a non-toxic reporter with no known pathogenic activity or toxicity. The absence of hazardous gene products further reduces risk and does not elevate the classification.\n\n4) Apply NIH Guidelines for recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid research with non-replicating lentiviral vectors. Under the NIH Guidelines, replication-incompetent lentiviral vectors derived from RG3 agents (such as HIV-1) are generally handled at Biosafety Level 2 with appropriate enhancements, and are considered RG2 agents for containment purposes when the insert does not increase hazard. This reflects that such vectors can infect and integrate into human cells but do not replicate or cause the disease associated with the RG3 parental virus.\n\n5) Consider the host system and setting. The work is conducted in vitro with primary human T-cells. Use of human primary cells is managed at a minimum of BSL-2 due to potential exposure to human materials and the integration-competent but replication-incompetent vector. There is no feature in this scenario (e.g., hazardous transgene, replication-competence, in vivo work) that would elevate the RG beyond RG2 or justify RG1 or exemption.\n\n6) Exclusion of other options. It is not RG1 because the vector can infect human cells and integrates into the genome, posing risks inconsistent with RG1. It is not RG3 or RG4 because the vector is replication-incompetent and lacks the disease-causing potential of HIV-1. It is not exempt from NIH Guidelines because experiments using replication-incompetent viral vectors fall under the purview of the Guidelines and require IBC review and BSL-2 containment.\n\n7) Conclusion. The appropriate Risk Group classification for this experiment, which dictates the minimum required biosafety containment level, is RG2.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2050711"}, {"introduction": "Biosafety is a dynamic responsibility, not a static, one-time approval. Scientific discovery is inherently unpredictable, and a researcher must be prepared to act when an experiment's risk profile changes unexpectedly. This advanced practice explores a researcher's most critical duties in such a scenario: ceasing work, securing materials, and properly reporting the event to the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) for re-assessment [@problem_id:2050689].", "problem": "Dr. Aris Thorne is a Principal Investigator (PI) conducting a Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) to study the development of antibiotic resistance. The experiment involves serially passaging a non-pathogenic, laboratory-adapted strain of *Escherichia coli* K-12 in a chemostat containing sub-lethal concentrations of a novel synthetic antibiotic. *E. coli* K-12 is classified as a Risk Group 1 (RG1) agent, and accordingly, the research protocol was registered with the university's Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) under Section III-E of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules. The work is being conducted at Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1).\n\nAfter 1,500 generations, Dr. Thorne isolates a clone that exhibits an exceptionally high level of resistance to the antibiotic. To characterize this evolved strain further, he initiates a collaboration with a colleague to test its effects in a standard C57BL/6 murine model, a procedure approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) based on the use of an RG1 agent. To his surprise, intravenous inoculation with the evolved strain results in systemic infection and mortality within 48 hours in all tested mice. The ancestral *E. coli* K-12 strain, used as a control, remains completely avirulent. This result strongly suggests that in the process of evolving antibiotic resistance, the strain has inadvertently acquired novel virulence factors, warranting its reclassification as, at minimum, an RG2 agent.\n\nAccording to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, which of the following sequences of actions represents the most appropriate and compliant immediate response for Dr. Thorne?\n\nA. Continue the LTEE experiment as planned to gather more data on the emergence of virulence, while beginning to draft a new protocol amendment to be submitted to the IBC at the next scheduled meeting.\n\nB. Immediately terminate the experiment by autoclaving all evolved bacterial cultures, sterilizing the chemostat, and then reporting the incident and the corrective actions taken to the IBC.\n\nC. Immediately cease all experimental manipulations involving the evolved virulent strain, secure all existing cultures within the BSL-1 laboratory, report the findings to the institution's Biosafety Officer and IBC, and prepare a new registration document to reclassify the experiment under Section III-D for work at BSL-2.\n\nD. Bypass the local IBC and report the unexpected evolution of a virulent agent directly to the NIH Office of Science Policy (OSP), as the Guidelines are a federal policy.\n\nE. Report the findings only to the IACUC, since the virulence was discovered in an animal model and directly impacts the approved animal protocol.\n\nF. Argue to the IBC that since the virulence has only been shown in mice and not humans, and the parental strain is RG1, the experiment can continue at BSL-1 with enhanced personal protective equipment.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the regulatory framework and risk classification. The ancestral agent is Escherichia coli K-12, a Risk Group 1 (RG1) organism, registered under Section III-E of the NIH Guidelines and handled at Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1). The unexpected result—systemic infection and uniform mortality in a standard murine model after intravenous challenge with the evolved clone—indicates that the evolved strain has acquired virulence consistent with, at minimum, Risk Group 2 (RG2) characteristics. Under the NIH Guidelines, RG classification informs the biosafety containment level, with RG2 agents requiring BSL-2 practices and facilities.\n\nNext, we apply the PI responsibilities under the NIH Guidelines. The Guidelines require PIs to:\n- Immediately report significant problems, violations, or research-related accidents and illnesses to the Biological Safety Officer (BSO), the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), and other appropriate institutional officials.\n- Not initiate or continue experiments that require IBC approval until such approval has been obtained (Section III-D experiments require IBC approval prior to initiation).\n- Implement appropriate containment and cease manipulations when risk changes indicate current containment is insufficient.\n\nBecause the evolved strain plausibly reclassifies the work from a Section III-E activity to a Section III-D activity (work with RG2 agents or work that requires BSL-2 containment), any continuation without prior IBC review and approval would be non-compliant. Therefore, the immediate actions must include halting manipulations, securing the agent to prevent exposure or release, and promptly notifying the BSO and IBC so that risk assessment, containment upgrades (to BSL-2), and re-registration under Section III-D can proceed.\n\nWe now evaluate the options against these requirements:\n\n- Option A (continue experiment while drafting an amendment for the next IBC meeting) is non-compliant because it proposes continuing work that now requires higher containment and prior IBC approval. Immediate continuation at BSL-1 after discovering a shift to RG2-level risk violates the Guidelines.\n- Option B (immediately autoclave all evolved cultures and sterilize, then report) is not the most appropriate immediate response under the Guidelines. While risk mitigation is essential, unilateral destruction precludes confirmatory analyses and appropriate institutional review of the event; the Guidelines emphasize immediate cessation, securing materials, and reporting for IBC-directed corrective action and reclassification rather than automatically destroying all materials without institutional oversight.\n- Option C (cease manipulations, secure cultures, report to BSO and IBC, and prepare new III-D registration for BSL-2 work) exactly matches the NIH Guidelines’ expectations: stop work when risk changes, secure materials, promptly notify institutional biosafety authorities, and obtain IBC approval for the appropriate containment (BSL-2) before any further work.\n- Option D (bypass IBC and report directly to NIH OSP) is improper. The institution and IBC oversee local compliance and reporting. Institutional officials, not the PI acting alone, are responsible for required reporting to NIH OSP when applicable.\n- Option E (report only to IACUC) is incomplete and non-compliant; IBC/BSO notification is required because the biosafety risk classification and containment requirements have changed.\n- Option F (continue at BSL-1 with enhanced PPE) is non-compliant; RG2 work demands BSL-2 facilities and procedures and IBC approval under Section III-D, not ad hoc PPE enhancements within BSL-1.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate and compliant immediate response under the NIH Guidelines is to stop manipulations, secure the materials, notify the BSO and IBC, and re-register the work under Section III-D for BSL-2 containment before proceeding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2050689"}]}
