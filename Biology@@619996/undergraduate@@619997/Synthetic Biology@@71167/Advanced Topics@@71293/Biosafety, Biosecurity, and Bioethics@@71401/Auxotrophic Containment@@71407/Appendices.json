The design intended to make the bacterium an auxotroph for a specific non-standard amino acid, preventing its survival outside the lab.

The strain does grow, however, on MM supplemented with a complete mixture of all 20 standard proteinogenic amino acids. This indicates an unintended auxotrophy for one or more standard amino acids.\n\nTo efficiently identify the required amino acid(s), the researchers employed a combinatorial pooling strategy. They divided the 20 standard amino acids into four pools, labeled A, B, C, and D.\n\n- **Pool A**: Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine\n- **Pool B**: Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Tryptophan, Serine, Threonine\n- **Pool C**: Cysteine, Methionine, Asparagine, Glutamine, Proline\n- **Pool D**: Lysine, Arginine, Histidine, Aspartic acid, Glutamic acid\n\nThey then streaked the engineered strain onto five different agar plates and observed the following results after incubation:\n\n- **Plate 1**: MM only. **Result**: No growth.\n- **Plate 2**: MM + Pool A + Pool B. **Result**: No growth.\n- **Plate 3**: MM + Pool A + Pool C. **Result**: No growth.\n- **Plate 4**: MM + Pool B + Pool C. **Result**: Growth.\n- **Plate 5**: MM + Pool C + Pool D. **Result**: No growth.\n\nBased on this set of experimental results, which of the following conclusions is the most accurate?\n\nA.

This thought experiment explores a powerful engineering principle for enhancing biosafety: redundancy. By applying basic probability theory, you will calculate how incorporating multiple, independent auxotrophic requirements can drastically reduce the overall probability of a containment failure, showcasing a fundamental strategy for building more secure genetically modified organisms [@problem_id:2019185].", "problem": "A key strategy in synthetic biology for ensuring the safe containment of genetically modified organisms is to engineer auxotrophy for a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA). An ncAA is an amino acid that is not one of the 20 commonly used in protein synthesis. This is typically achieved by reassigning a rare codon, such as a stop codon, to encode the ncAA. The engineered organism can only survive if this specific ncAA is provided in its environment, as it is required for the synthesis of one or more essential proteins.\n\nAn \"escape event\" is defined as a mutation that allows the organism to survive and replicate in a natural environment lacking the ncAA. For this problem, we will consider that the only mechanism for an escape event is a spontaneous point mutation at an engineered codon site, causing it to revert to a codon that specifies one of the standard 20 amino acids.\n\nLet $p$ be the probability of such a reversionary mutation occurring at any single engineered ncAA-encoding codon site, per organism, per generation. You may assume that $p$ is much less than 1 ($p \\ll 1$) and that mutation events at different codon sites are statistically independent.\n\nConsider two different engineered bacterial strains:\n- **Strain A**: This strain is engineered to incorporate the ncAA at a single, critical site within one essential protein.\n- **Strain B**: To enhance containment, this strain is engineered to incorporate the ncAA at one critical site in each of $N$ different essential proteins. For Strain B to escape containment, all $N$ of these dependent sites must undergo a reversionary mutation.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the ratio of the escape probability of Strain B to that of Strain A.", "solution": "Define $E_{A}$ as the event that Strain A escapes in a given organism in a given generation, and $E_{B}$ as the event that Strain B escapes under the same conditions.\n\nBy definition, for a single engineered ncAA-encoding codon site, the probability that it undergoes a reversionary point mutation in one generation is $p$, with $p \\ll 1$. For Strain A, which has exactly one such critical site in an essential protein, the escape event requires that this single site reverts. Therefore, using the given definition,\n$$\nP(E_{A}) = p.\n$$\n\nFor Strain B, there are $N$ distinct engineered ncAA-encoding sites, one in each of $N$ different essential proteins, and all $N$ must revert to standard amino-acid-encoding codons for escape. The problem states that mutation events at different codon sites are statistically independent. Thus, if we denote by $E_{i}$ the event that site $i$ reverts in a generation, with $P(E_{i}) = p$ for each $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,N\\}$, then the escape event for Strain B is the intersection $\\bigcap_{i=1}^{N} E_{i}$. By the multiplication rule for independent events,\n$$\nP(E_{B}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(E_{i}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} p = p^{N}.\n$$\n\nThe requested ratio of the escape probability of Strain B to that of Strain A is therefore\n$$\n\\frac{P(E_{B})}{P(E_{A})} = \\frac{p^{N}}{p} = p^{N-1}.\n$$\n\nThis result relies on the independence of mutations across sites and the definition of $p$ as the per-site, per-organism, per-generation reversion probability.
