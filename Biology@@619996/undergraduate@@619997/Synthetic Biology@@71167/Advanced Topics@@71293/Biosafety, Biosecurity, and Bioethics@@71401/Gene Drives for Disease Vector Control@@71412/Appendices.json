The system is designed to insert a large DNA cassette into a specific target locus on an autosome. The wild-type (WT) allele at this locus contains a 200 base pair (bp) sequence that is crucial for a non-essential metabolic process. The gene drive (GD) allele is created by replacing this entire 200 bp sequence with a 4,500 bp cassette containing the genes for a Cas9 nuclease and a guide RNA (gRNA).\n\nTo monitor the spread of the gene drive in a mosquito population, the researchers need a robust genotyping method based on the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Their goal is to design a single PCR experiment that can unambiguously distinguish among the three possible genotypes: homozygous wild-type (WT/WT), heterozygous (GD/WT), and homozygous gene drive (GD/GD).\n\nFour primers have been designed with the following binding characteristics:\n- **Primer F:** A forward primer that binds to the genomic region 150 bp upstream of the 200 bp replacement site.\n- **Primer R_WT:** A reverse primer that binds within the 200 bp sequence that is present only in the wild-type allele. Its binding site is 50 bp from the downstream end of this sequence.\n- **Primer R_GD:** A reverse primer that binds to a sequence located 450 bp inside the 4,500 bp gene drive cassette, relative to the upstream insertion point.\n- **Primer R_Far:** A reverse primer that binds to the genomic region 200 bp downstream of the 200 bp replacement site.\n\nAssuming standard PCR conditions are used where products up to approximately 2,000 bp are efficiently amplified, but products significantly larger than that are not, which of the following primer combinations, when used together in a single reaction tube, would be the most effective strategy for distinguishing all three genotypes?\n\nA.

The spread of a drive allele is a dynamic process governed by a tug-of-war between its self-propagating homing mechanism, characterized by efficiency $e$, and the fitness costs it imposes on the host ($s_h$ and $s_d$).

The drive system is based on the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology. It is modeled as a single genetic locus with two alleles: the wild-type allele `w` and the drive allele `D`.\n\nIn a large, randomly mating population with discrete, non-overlapping generations, the relative fitnesses of the three possible genotypes (`ww`, `wD`, `DD`) are given by $W_{ww}=1$, $W_{wD}=1-s_h$, and $W_{DD}=1-s_d$. The drive allele `D` is designed to be suppressive, leading to fitness costs for individuals that carry it.\n\nIn `wD` heterozygotes, the CRISPR-based drive mechanism attempts to convert the `w` allele into a `D` allele in the germline before gamete formation. This process, known as homing, is not perfectly efficient. The homing efficiency, $e$, is the probability that a `w` allele is successfully converted to a `D` allele in the germline of a heterozygote. Consequently, a `wD` individual produces gametes containing the `D` allele with a proportion of $\\frac{1+e}{2}$.\n\nAnalysis reveals that for certain parameter values, the drive can only spread through the population if its initial allele frequency exceeds a specific threshold, known as the critical introduction allele frequency. Below this frequency, the drive is eliminated by natural selection.\n\nGiven the following parameters for the designed drive system:\n- Heterozygous fitness cost, $s_h = 0.10$\n- Homozygous fitness cost, $s_d = 0.15$\n- Homing efficiency, $e = 0.08$\n\nCalculate the critical introduction allele frequency for this suppression drive.

The system is designed to target a specific 20-nucleotide DNA sequence, known as the protospacer, within a vital gene of the mosquito. The chosen protospacer sequence is `5'-GCATTGTACCGGTAATGCAG-3'`. For cleavage to occur, the SpCas9-guide RNA (gRNA) complex must recognize this protospacer sequence as well as an adjacent `NGG` sequence (where N is any nucleotide) located immediately to the 3' end of the protospacer. This adjacent sequence is called the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM).\n\nA critical step in bio-safety assessment is to evaluate the risk of the gene drive affecting non-target organisms. The genomes of five sympatric, non-target insect species (labeled A, B, C, D, and E) were computationally screened for potential off-target sites. An off-target site is defined as a 20-nucleotide sequence followed by a valid `NGG` PAM that has some sequence similarity to the intended protospacer.\n\nTo quantify the risk, an empirical model is used. The model defines a \"Cleavage Potential\" ($C$) for each potential off-target site based on the number and location of nucleotide mismatches relative to the intended protospacer. Mismatches in the 10 nucleotides proximal to the PAM (positions 11-20, called the \"seed region\") are known to be more detrimental to binding and cleavage than mismatches in the 10 nucleotides distal to the PAM (positions 1-10, the \"non-seed region\").\n\nThe Cleavage Potential for a single site is calculated using the formula:\n$$C = 100 \\times (0.2)^{m_s} \\times (0.8)^{m_n}$$\nwhere $m_s$ is the number of mismatches in the seed region and $m_n$ is the number of mismatches in the non-seed region.\n\nThe results of the genomic screen are summarized in the table below, which lists the number of potential off-target sites ($N$) found for each combination of seed and non-seed mismatches across the five species.\n\n| Species | Seed Mismatches ($m_s$) | Non-Seed Mismatches ($m_n$) | Number of Sites Found ($N$) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| A | 0 | 1 | 2 |\n| A | 1 | 2 | 5 |\n| B | 1 | 1 | 8 |\n| C | 0 | 2 | 1 |\n| C | 2 | 1 | 10 |\n| D | 1 | 3 | 4 |\n| E | 2 | 2 | 7 |\n| E | 3 | 0 | 3 |\n\nCalculate the total aggregate off-target risk score for this ecosystem, which is the sum of the Cleavage Potentials of all identified off-target sites across all five species.
