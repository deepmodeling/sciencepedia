This first exercise challenges you to apply your knowledge to a common scenario: the safe disposal of an engineered Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) bacterial culture. Mastering this procedure is a crucial first step for any researcher, ensuring that genetically modified organisms are contained and do not pose a risk to the environment outside the lab. [@problem_id:2023120]", "problem": "A team of undergraduate students is participating in a synthetic biology competition. They have successfully engineered a strain of *Escherichia coli* to produce a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). This engineered strain is classified as Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1), which means it is not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adult humans and presents minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment.\n\nAfter completing their final measurements, a student is tasked with disposing of 500 mL of liquid culture containing this BSL-1 engineered *E. coli*. The lab is equipped with standard supplies, including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), household bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution), 70% ethanol, biohazard bags, and an autoclave.\n\nWhich of the following describes the correct and safest standard procedure for the disposal of this liquid culture in a typical BSL-1 teaching laboratory?\n\nA. Pour the entire 500 mL of liquid culture directly down a designated laboratory sink, followed by flushing the sink with a large volume of cold water for two minutes.\n\nB. Tightly seal the flask containing the liquid culture with a screw cap and place it in a solid biohazard waste container for incineration.\n\nC. Don appropriate PPE, such as a lab coat and gloves.

Pour the liquid culture directly into an open, shallow autoclave-safe pan, place the pan in an autoclave, and run a standard liquid sterilization cycle. After the cycle is complete, pour the sterilized liquid down the sink.\n\nE. Don appropriate PPE. Add 100 mL of 70% ethanol to the 500 mL of liquid culture, swirl to mix, and immediately pour the solution down a designated laboratory sink.", "solution": "The goal is to identify the correct and safest procedure for decontaminating and disposing of a Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) liquid culture of engineered *E. coli*. Even though BSL-1 organisms pose a minimal risk, standard laboratory practice requires that they be inactivated before disposal to prevent the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. We will analyze each option to determine its validity.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis procedure involves pouring a live bacterial culture directly into the sewer system. This is a major biosafety violation. While wastewater treatment plants can handle some microorganisms, it is against standard practice to intentionally dispose of large volumes of live cultures, especially genetically modified ones, without prior decontamination. This option fails to inactivate the microorganisms.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis procedure involves sealing the culture and placing it in a solid waste container. There are two major issues here. First, disposing of a large volume of liquid in solid waste containers is improper and can lead to leaks and spills. Second, if this container were to be autoclaved (a common treatment for solid biohazard waste), sealing the flask tightly is extremely dangerous. Heating a sealed container of liquid will cause a massive pressure buildup, creating an explosion hazard. The primary culture is also not decontaminated by this action alone.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis procedure outlines a standard chemical decontamination protocol.\n1.  **Don appropriate PPE:** This is the correct first step for any laboratory procedure to protect the user from splashes.\n2.  **Add bleach to a final concentration of 10%:** Household bleach (sodium hypochlorite) is a broad-spectrum, effective, and inexpensive disinfectant. A 10% final concentration (1 part bleach to 9 parts culture) is a standard recommendation for inactivating most bacterial cultures.\n3.  **Let it sit for at least 20 minutes:** This provides the necessary contact time for the bleach to effectively kill the bacteria. Inactivation is not instantaneous. 20-30 minutes is a standard recommended time.\n4.  **Pour the treated mixture down the sink with running water:** Once the culture is chemically inactivated, the liquid is considered non-hazardous and can be safely disposed of down a designated laboratory sink. The running water helps to dilute the bleach, protecting the plumbing.\nThis option describes a complete, safe, and effective method for liquid waste decontamination in a BSL-1 setting.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis procedure describes using an autoclave, which is a valid method of sterilization. However, the procedure as described is flawed and less practical for this specific scenario than chemical decontamination. Pouring the liquid into an open, shallow pan creates a significant risk of aerosol generation and spillage during transport to the autoclave. The standard practice is to autoclave liquids in a loosely capped, crack-resistant bottle (like borosilicate glass) placed inside a secondary containment tray. While autoclaving works, the method described is hazardous. For a single flask of liquid in a teaching lab, chemical decontamination (Option C) is often more efficient and straightforward.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\nThis procedure uses 70% ethanol as the decontaminant. While 70% ethanol is an effective surface disinfectant, it is a poor choice for decontaminating a large volume of liquid culture. The final concentration of ethanol after adding 100 mL to 500 mL of culture would be `100 mL / (100 mL + 500 mL) * 70% = 11.7%`, which is far too low to be an effective biocide. Furthermore, the procedure specifies immediate disposal, which provides no contact time for any potential inactivation to occur. This method is ineffective.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing all options, Option C is the only one that describes a complete, safe, effective, and standard procedure for the chemical decontamination and disposal of a BSL-1 liquid culture in a typical laboratory environment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2023120"}, {"introduction": "A more robust approach to biosafety involves engineering containment directly into the organism's genome, a strategy known as intrinsic biocontainment. In this problem, we explore auxotrophy, where an engineered alga is made dependent on a high concentration of a specific nutrient for survival.
