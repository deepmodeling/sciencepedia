{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Gene drives function by breaking the traditional rules of Mendelian inheritance, which predict a 50% chance of passing on an allele from a heterozygous parent. This first exercise focuses on the core mechanism of \"homing,\" where the drive machinery converts a wild-type allele into a drive allele, biasing inheritance. By working through this problem, you will learn to calculate the expected inheritance frequency of a gene drive allele from a heterozygous individual, providing a quantitative foundation for understanding its powerful ability to spread [@problem_id:2072273].", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is designing a system for population control of an invasive insect species. They have created a synthetic gene drive system based on CRISPR-Cas9 technology. In this system, there are two alleles for a specific gene locus: the gene drive allele, denoted as $GD$, and the wild-type allele, denoted as $+$.\n\nThe gene drive operates through a process called \"homing\" which occurs in the germline cells of heterozygous individuals ($GD/+$). During gamete formation, the $GD$ allele on one chromosome produces an enzyme that cuts the other chromosome at the site of the wild-type $+$ allele. The cell's repair mechanism then uses the chromosome carrying the $GD$ allele as a template, converting the $+$ allele into a $GD$ allele. In this particular system, the homing process has an efficiency of 90%; that is, in 90% of the cases where a $+$ allele could be converted, it is successfully changed to a $GD$ allele.\n\nConsider a cross between a heterozygous male ($GD/+$) and a wild-type female ($+/+$). Assuming Mendelian segregation for the alleles that do not undergo homing, calculate the expected proportion of the offspring that will inherit the gene drive allele ($GD$). Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Let $h$ denote the homing efficiency in the $GD/+$ male germline. In a germline cell:\n- With probability $h$, homing converts the $+$ allele to $GD$, yielding a $GD/GD$ cell that produces only $GD$ gametes, i.e., probability $1$ of a $GD$ gamete.\n- With probability $1-h$, homing fails and the cell remains $GD/+$, producing gametes by Mendelian segregation, i.e., $\\frac{1}{2}$ $GD$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ $+$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a sperm carries $GD$ is\n$$\np_{GD}^{\\text{sperm}}=h\\cdot 1+(1-h)\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{h}{2}=\\frac{1+h}{2}.\n$$\nMating with a $+/+$ female (all eggs are $+$) means the proportion of offspring inheriting $GD$ equals the proportion of paternal gametes carrying $GD$:\n$$\np_{GD}^{\\text{offspring}}=p_{GD}^{\\text{sperm}}=\\frac{1+h}{2}.\n$$\nWith $h=0.9$,\n$$\np_{GD}^{\\text{offspring}}=\\frac{1+0.9}{2}=0.95.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.95}$$", "id": "2072273"}, {"introduction": "Having established how a gene drive biases inheritance in a single genetic cross, we now scale up our analysis to the population level. This practice explores how the introduction of a small number of gene drive carriers can alter the allele frequency of an entire population in just one generation.

The population is assumed to be very large and to mate randomly. Initially, the population consists exclusively of individuals homozygous for the wild-type allele, 'w'.\n\nTo test the drive, a group of individuals heterozygous for a synthetic gene drive allele, 'D', are introduced into the population. After they are introduced and have thoroughly mixed with the native population, these heterozygous 'Dw' individuals make up exactly 1.0% of the total breeding population for the first generation. The remaining 99.0% of the breeding population consists of the original wild-type 'ww' individuals.\n\nThe gene drive is designed to be perfectly efficient. This means it has a 100% homing efficiency: in the germline of any 'Dw' heterozygote, the 'w' allele is converted into a 'D' allele, so that the individual produces only 'D' gametes.

The drive system, denoted GD, targets a haplosufficient essential gene. When an individual heterozygous for the drive (GD/+) produces germline cells, the GD element on one chromosome cuts the wild-type (+) allele on the homologous chromosome. This double-strand break can be repaired in one of several ways:\n\n1.  **Homing/Drive Conversion**: The cell uses the GD-carrying chromosome as a template to repair the break, converting the + allele into a GD allele.\n2.  **r1 Allele Formation**: The break is repaired by error-prone Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), introducing an indel that disrupts the gene's function and also prevents the GD from cutting the site again. These are called non-functional resistance alleles (r1).\n3.  **r2 Allele Formation**: The break is repaired by NHEJ, introducing an in-frame indel that preserves the gene's function but still prevents the GD from re-cutting the site. These are called functional resistance alleles (r2).\n\nTo quantify the efficiency and outcomes of their system, the researchers performed deep sequencing on a large population of gametes produced by heterozygous (GD/+) male mosquitoes. The sequencing reads corresponding to the target locus were categorized, yielding the following counts:\n\n-   Number of GD allele reads: $N_{GD} = 485,000$\n-   Number of + allele reads: $N_{+} = 5,000$\n-   Number of r1 allele reads: $N_{r1} = 8,000$\n-   Number of r2 allele reads: $N_{r2} = 2,000$\n\nYour task is to calculate three key parameters from this data:\n-   The drive conversion rate, $c$, defined as the proportion of initial wild-type alleles that are converted to GD alleles.\n-   The r1 formation rate, $f_{r1}$, defined as the proportion of initial wild-type alleles that are converted to r1 alleles.\n-   The r2 formation rate, $f_{r2}$, defined as the proportion of initial wild-type alleles that are converted to r2 alleles.\n\nProvide your three numerical answers in the order $c$, $f_{r1}$, and $f_{r2}$.
