They have cloned the candidate toxin gene into a plasmid, pTOX, under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter (P_ara). They have also cloned the candidate antitoxin gene into a second plasmid, pANTI, under the control of an Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible promoter (P_lac). Both plasmids carry different antibiotic resistance markers, and they are co-transformed into a suitable strain of *E. coli* that does not have these genes natively.\n\nAn overnight liquid culture of the co-transformed *E. coli* is grown in a medium containing both antibiotics but without any inducers. This culture is then diluted and spread-plated onto four different types of solid agar plates. Each plate contains the necessary antibiotics to maintain the plasmids. The plates are supplemented with inducers as follows:\n- Plate 1: No inducers\n- Plate 2: Arabinose only\n- Plate 3: IPTG only\n- Plate 4: Arabinose and IPTG\n\nAfter incubation, the number of viable colonies on each plate is observed. Assuming the genes function as a genuine TA pair, where the toxin is lethal unless neutralized by the antitoxin, and the antitoxin itself is not harmful, which of the following outcomes would be expected?\n\nA. A significant number of colonies grow on Plate 4 only.\n\nB. A significant number of colonies grow on Plates 1, 3, and 4, but no or very few colonies grow on Plate 2.\n\nC.

The stated biological principles are:\n- Inducible promoters drive expression only in the presence of their specific inducer; without inducer, expression is minimal and not expected to affect viability in a way that produces many colonies unless stated otherwise.\n- The toxin is lethal unless neutralized by the antitoxin.\n- The antitoxin alone is not harmful.\n\nEvaluate each plate:\n- Plate 1 (no inducers): Neither toxin nor antitoxin is induced. With no toxin produced, cells remain viable. Expect many colonies.\n- Plate 2 (arabinose only): Toxin is induced, antitoxin is not. The toxin is lethal in the absence of antitoxin, so cells die. Expect no or very few colonies.\n- Plate 3 (IPTG only): Antitoxin is induced, toxin is not. Antitoxin alone is not harmful, and no toxin is present. Expect many colonies.\n- Plate 4 (arabinose and IPTG): Both toxin and antitoxin are induced; the antitoxin neutralizes the toxin, restoring viability.

This phenomenon relies on a simple yet elegant dynamic principle: the antitoxin is much less stable than the toxin. This practice challenges you to quantify the consequences of this differential stability. By deriving an expression for the time until toxicity after a cell loses its TA-encoding plasmid, you will translate a biological concept into a mathematical model, giving you a powerful tool to understand the temporal dynamics that govern cell fate.

This system produces two proteins: a stable toxin (T) and a labile antitoxin (A).

The synthesis machinery produces the antitoxin at a rate that is 2.5 times the production rate of the toxin. The antitoxin is selectively targeted for degradation by a specific protease whose function is dependent on Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).

Both proteins are diluted as the cell grows and divides.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the culture is subjected to a severe metabolic shock. This shock is assumed to instantaneously halt all new protein synthesis and cause the intracellular ATP concentration to plummet. The reduced ATP availability cripples the protease, reducing its first-order rate constant for antitoxin degradation to just 10% of its normal value.\n\nAssuming the binding between toxin and antitoxin is extremely tight and rapid, free toxin will only begin to accumulate once the total intracellular concentration of toxin exceeds the total concentration of antitoxin.
