However, this process must obey the fundamental rules of molecular biology. This exercise explores the most critical of these rules: maintaining the genetic reading frame. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario where an exon of a specific length is skipped, you will discover why the number of nucleotides in an exon is not arbitrary and what happens when the 'rule of three' is broken [@problem_id:1468325].", "problem": "In a particular line of eukaryotic cells, a gene responsible for producing a cytoskeletal protein called \"Structrin\" is actively transcribed. The initial transcript, or pre-messenger Ribonucleic Acid (pre-mRNA), contains five exons. In most cell types, all five exons are spliced together to produce a functional mRNA sequence. However, in response to a specific signaling molecule, a specialized splicing factor causes Exon 4 to be excluded from the final mature mRNA transcript. This alternatively spliced mRNA is then translated into a variant of the Structrin protein. The length of Exon 4 is exactly 50 nucleotides.\n\nAssuming that the splicing of Exon 3 to Exon 5 is successful and does not introduce or remove any additional nucleotides at the splice junction, which of the following statements describes the most direct and certain consequence for the reading frame of the mature mRNA?\n\nA. The reading frame will be preserved, but the resulting protein will be shorter by 16 amino acids.\n\nB. The reading frame will be shifted for all codons downstream of the splice junction.\n\nC. The reading frame will be unaffected because the ribosome can skip over the altered splice junction.\n\nD. Splicing will be completely blocked, as exons that are not a multiple of three nucleotides in length cannot be removed.\n\nE. The reading frame will be preserved, but the resulting protein will be shorter by 17 amino acids.", "solution": "The central principle required to solve this problem is the nature of the genetic code and the concept of a reading frame. The genetic code is a triplet code, meaning that the sequence of nucleotides in a messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) molecule is read by the ribosome in successive, non-overlapping groups of three. Each group of three nucleotides is called a codon, and it specifies a particular amino acid (or a stop signal).\n\nThe reading frame is the specific way in which the sequence of nucleotides is partitioned into codons. A continuous coding sequence is established when the ribosome initiates translation at a start codon (usually AUG) and reads in triplets from that point onwards.\n\nIn this problem, a gene's pre-mRNA is processed. The process of splicing removes introns and joins exons together to form the mature mRNA. In the standard case, all five exons are joined, creating a continuous reading frame. In the case of alternative splicing described, Exon 4 is skipped. This means that Exon 3 is ligated directly to Exon 5.\n\nThe length of the skipped Exon 4 is 50 nucleotides. For the reading frame to be maintained across the new splice junction (between Exon 3 and Exon 5), the number of nucleotides removed must be an integer multiple of 3. If a multiple of 3 nucleotides is removed, an integer number of codons is removed, and the reading frame downstream of the deletion remains aligned as before.\n\nLet's analyze the number of nucleotides removed: 50. We check if 50 is a multiple of 3.\n$$\n\\frac{50}{3} = 16.666...\n$$\nSince 50 is not an integer multiple of 3, removing this exon will cause a frameshift mutation. After Exon 3, the ribosome will continue reading in triplets, but because 50 nucleotides are missing, the grouping of nucleotides into codons will be shifted. For example, if the original sequence was `...AAA GGG CCC TTT...` where `AAA` is the last codon in Exon 3 and `GGG` is the first codon in Exon 4, and let's say after 50 nucleotides the sequence at the start of Exon 5 is `UUU`, the new sequence becomes `...AAA UUU...`. However, the shift is more complex. The removal of 50 nucleotides means the removal of 16 full codons and 2 extra nucleotides ($50 = 16 \\times 3 + 2$). This 2-nucleotide deficit will cause all subsequent codons to be read out of frame. This altered sequence of codons will almost certainly code for a completely different sequence of amino acids. Furthermore, a frameshift mutation very often introduces a premature stop codon, leading to the synthesis of a truncated and non-functional protein.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. This option claims the reading frame is preserved. This is incorrect, as 50 is not a multiple of 3. The calculation of 16 amino acids comes from $50 \\div 3 \\approx 16$, which ignores the remainder and its effect on the reading frame.\n\nB. This option correctly states that the reading frame will be shifted for all codons downstream of the splice junction. This is the direct and unavoidable consequence of deleting a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of 3.\n\nC. This option suggests the ribosome can compensate for the change. Ribosomes do not have such a mechanism; they slavishly read the mRNA in triplets from the start codon. They cannot \"skip over\" or correct a frameshift in the mRNA template.\n\nD. This option claims splicing is blocked. This is incorrect. The splicing machinery recognizes specific sequences at the exon-intron boundaries (splice donor and acceptor sites), not the length of the exon in relation to the genetic code. Alternative splicing is a regulated process that allows for the skipping of exons regardless of their length.\n\nE. This option, like A, incorrectly claims the reading frame is preserved. The calculation of 17 amino acids is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and certain consequence is a shift in the reading frame.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1468325"}, {"introduction": "When a cassette exon is included in a transcript while preserving the reading frame, it adds a new segment to the resulting protein.
