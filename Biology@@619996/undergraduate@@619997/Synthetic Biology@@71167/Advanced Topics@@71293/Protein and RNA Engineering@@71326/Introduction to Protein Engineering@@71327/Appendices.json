[@problem_id:2045950]", "problem": "A bioengineering student is working on a project involving a globular enzyme essential for a metabolic pathway. A specific leucine (Leu) residue has been identified deep within the enzyme's hydrophobic core. For experimental purposes, the student needs to create a conservative point mutation at this position. A conservative mutation is defined as a substitution that is least likely to significantly disrupt the protein's native three-dimensional structure and overall stability.\n\nGiven the standard amino acids listed below, which one would be the most suitable replacement for this leucine residue to minimize perturbation of the hydrophobic core?\n\nA. Isoleucine (Ile)\n\nB. Valine (Val)\n\nC. Tryptophan (Trp)\n\nD. Serine (Ser)\n\nE. Methionine (Met)", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the amino acid that would serve as the most conservative substitution for a leucine residue located in a protein's hydrophobic core. A conservative substitution minimizes changes in the physicochemical properties of the side chain, thereby minimizing disruption to the protein's structure and function. The key properties to consider for a residue in a hydrophobic core are size, shape, and polarity.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the original amino acid, Leucine (Leu). Its side chain is `-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. This is a nonpolar, aliphatic side chain. It contributes to the hydrophobic interactions that drive protein folding and stabilize the core. Therefore, the ideal replacement should also be nonpolar and of a similar size and shape to maintain the dense packing within the core.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given options:\n\n**A. Isoleucine (Ile):** The side chain of isoleucine is `-CH(CH3)CH2CH3`. Isoleucine is a constitutional isomer of leucine; they have the same chemical formula (`C6H13NO2`) and thus the same mass and volume. Like leucine, its side chain is nonpolar and aliphatic. The only difference is the branching pattern (branched at the beta-carbon for Ile, versus the gamma-carbon for Leu). Because its size, shape, and hydrophobicity are extremely similar to leucine's, substituting leucine with isoleucine is expected to cause a very minimal structural perturbation. These two amino acids are often interchanged naturally in homologous proteins.\n\n**B. Valine (Val):** The side chain of valine is `-CH(CH3)2`. Valine is also nonpolar and aliphatic. However, it is significantly smaller than leucine, as it lacks a methylene (`-CH2-`) group. Replacing the bulkier leucine with the smaller valine would create a cavity or void in the tightly packed hydrophobic core. Such cavities are energetically unfavorable and can lead to a collapse of the local structure, thus destabilizing the protein. This makes it a less conservative substitution than one that preserves the original volume.\n\n**C. Tryptophan (Trp):** The side chain of tryptophan contains a large, rigid indole ring. While tryptophan is hydrophobic and often found buried in proteins, its side chain is much larger and bulkier than leucine's. Its aromatic and planar structure is also very different from leucine's flexible aliphatic chain. Substituting leucine with tryptophan would likely cause significant steric clashes with neighboring residues, forcing a major rearrangement of the protein's core and severely disrupting its structure.\n\n**D. Serine (Ser):** The side chain of serine is `-CH2-OH`. The hydroxyl (`-OH`) group makes serine a polar amino acid. Introducing a polar group into the nonpolar environment of the hydrophobic core is highly energetically unfavorable. The hydrophobic effect, which stabilizes the core, would be disrupted, and the polar hydroxyl group would be unable to form its preferred hydrogen bonds with water. This would be a highly destabilizing mutation.\n\n**E. Methionine (Met):** The side chain of methionine is `-CH2-CH2-S-CH3`. Methionine is hydrophobic and has a volume comparable to leucine. However, its side chain is a flexible, unbranched chain containing a sulfur atom, whereas leucine's side chain is a branched hydrocarbon. This difference in shape and flexibility would lead to different packing interactions within the core compared to leucine. While it is a better choice than serine or tryptophan, the near-identical size and shape of isoleucine make isoleucine a more conservative choice.\n\nComparing all the candidates, Isoleucine (Ile) is the most similar to Leucine (Leu) in terms of its crucial properties: hydrophobicity, size, and branched aliphatic character. Therefore, it is the substitution that will least perturb the structure of the hydrophobic core.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2045950"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply preserving structure, protein engineers often aim to purposefully alter a protein's function. This problem shifts our focus from structural stability to catalytic activity, which lies at the heart of enzyme engineering. By predicting the outcome of mutating a key residue in an enzyme's active site, you will learn to distinguish between amino acids responsible for folding and those essential for function, a critical skill for redesigning enzymes for novel purposes. [@problem_id:2045919]", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a team is engineering a novel protease, named 'SynthasePro', designed to specifically degrade a toxic peptide byproduct in a bacterial culture. Through structural analysis and previous experiments, they have identified that a serine residue at position 94 (Ser-94) is a critical component of the enzyme's catalytic active site, acting as the primary nucleophile during the cleavage of the peptide bond. A researcher decides to perform site-directed mutagenesis to replace this Ser-94 with an alanine residue (Ala). Which of the following is the most likely and direct functional consequence of this Ser94Ala mutation?\n\nA. The protein will fail to fold into its correct three-dimensional structure and will be degraded by the cell.\n\nB. The enzyme's catalytic activity will be severely diminished or completely abolished, while its overall structure and substrate binding ability remain largely intact.\n\nC. The mutation will cause the enzyme to bind to its substrate with much higher affinity, effectively trapping the substrate in the active site.\n\nD. The enzyme will switch its substrate specificity to cleave a different type of peptide bond.\n\nE. The mutation will significantly increase the enzyme's optimal operating temperature.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most likely functional consequence of mutating a catalytic serine to an alanine in a protease. To determine this, we must analyze the chemical properties of both amino acids and their roles within the enzyme's active site.\n\n1.  **Analyze the original residue: Serine (Ser)**\n    The side chain of serine is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). The crucial feature of this side chain is the terminal hydroxyl (-OH) group. This group is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding. More importantly, in the context of a serine protease active site, the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group is a potent nucleophile. The problem statement explicitly confirms this, stating Ser-94 \"act[s] as the primary nucleophile during the cleavage of the peptide bond.\" This nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate's peptide bond is the essential first step of the catalytic mechanism.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mutant residue: Alanine (Ala)**\n    The side chain of alanine is a simple methyl group (-CH3). This group is small, non-polar (hydrophobic), and chemically inert. It cannot act as a nucleophile, nor can it participate in hydrogen bonding as a donor or acceptor.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the consequences of the mutation (Ser94Ala)**\n\n    *   **Effect on Catalysis:** The core function of Ser-94 is to provide the nucleophilic hydroxyl group necessary for catalysis. By replacing serine with alanine, this essential functional group is removed and substituted with a non-reactive methyl group. Without the nucleophile, the chemical reaction (peptide bond cleavage) cannot be initiated. Therefore, the enzyme's catalytic activity will be drastically reduced, likely to a negligible level or completely abolished.\n\n    *   **Effect on Protein Structure and Folding:** Alanine is a small amino acid, even smaller than serine. The substitution of serine with alanine is considered a relatively conservative change in terms of steric bulk. While it changes the local chemical environment from polar to non-polar, a single mutation of this type on the surface of a protein or in an active site cleft is highly unlikely to disrupt the global three-dimensional fold of the entire protein. We would expect the overall structure to remain largely intact. This makes option A incorrect.\n\n    *   **Effect on Substrate Binding:** An enzyme's active site typically has residues for substrate binding (which confer specificity) and residues for catalysis. The problem identifies Ser-94 as a *catalytic* residue. While it is part of the active site, its primary role is not substrate recognition. The substrate would likely still be able to bind to the active site pocket, which is formed by other residues. However, once bound, the catalytic step cannot proceed. Therefore, the mutation is unlikely to prevent binding or significantly increase binding affinity (trapping the substrate). This makes options C and D incorrect. Option D, a change in specificity, would typically require more substantial changes in the binding pocket, not just the removal of a catalytic group.\n\n    *   **Effect on Stability:** While mutations can affect protein stability (e.g., thermal stability), it is not the most direct or primary *functional* consequence of removing a key catalytic residue. The primary function of a protease is catalysis, and the most certain outcome of removing the catalytic machinery is the loss of that function. Thus, option E is not the best description of the outcome.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The most direct and certain consequence of replacing the catalytic nucleophile (Ser-94) with a non-reactive group (Ala) is the loss of catalytic function. The overall protein structure and its ability to bind the substrate are expected to be largely unaffected.
