As part of this work, they need to express a short marker tetrapeptide with the sequence `Met-Asn-Trp-Gly`. The biologist uses a codon optimization algorithm that is naively based on the organism's genomic codon usage frequency, selecting the single most frequent codon for each amino acid.\n\nThe codon usage table for `T. editanus`, derived from genomic analysis, is as follows:\n- **Met (Start):** `AUG` (100%)\n- **Asn:** `AAU` (85%), `AAC` (15%)\n- **Trp:** `UGG` (100%)\n- **Gly:** `GGU` (40%), `GGC` (40%), `GGA` (10%), `GGG` (10%)\n\nHowever, `T. editanus` possesses a highly active Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR) enzyme. This enzyme post-transcriptionally edits messenger RNA (mRNA) by converting Adenosine (A) to Inosine (I). For the purpose of translation, the ribosome interprets Inosine (I) as Guanine (G). The editing activity in this organism is highly specific: any Adenosine that is immediately followed by a Uridine in the mRNA sequence (i.e., within any `5'-AU-3'` dinucleotide context) has a probability $p_{\\text{edit}} = 0.92$ of being edited. Editing events at different sites on the same mRNA molecule are statistically independent.\n\nAssume that if the `AUG` start codon is modified by editing, translation initiation fails completely for that mRNA molecule. Any other editing event results in the synthesis of an incorrect peptide. What is the probability that a single mRNA transcript, generated from the gene sequence designed by the naive algorithm, will be successfully translated into the correct `Met-Asn-Trp-Gly` peptide?\n\nRound your final answer to two significant figures.", "solution": "The naive codon optimization selects, for each residue, the most frequent codon in the provided table:\n- Met: AUG (unique and 100%).\n- Asn: AAU (85%).\n- Trp: UGG (unique and 100%).\n- Gly: the most frequent codons are GGU and GGC (both 40%). Although the tie-breaking rule is unspecified, either choice yields the same analysis below because neither introduces additional adenosines or creates an inter-codon 5'-AU-3' context.\n\nThus, the designed coding sequence is\n$$\n5'\\text{-} \\mathrm{AUG}\\text{-}\\mathrm{AAU}\\text{-}\\mathrm{UGG}\\text{-}\\mathrm{GGX}\\text{-}3',\n$$\nwith $X \\in \\{ \\mathrm{U}, \\mathrm{C} \\}$.\n\nADAR edits any adenine that is immediately followed by uridine (an AU dinucleotide) with probability $p_{\\mathrm{edit}}$, independently across sites. Successful, correct translation requires that no such AU-site editing occurs anywhere in the mRNA; in particular, if the A in AUG is edited, initiation fails entirely, and if the A in AAU at the second position is edited, the Asn codon becomes AGU (Ser), yielding an incorrect peptide.\n\nIdentify all AU dinucleotides in the sequence:\n- In AUG, the first two bases are A followed by U, giving one AU site.\n- In AAU, the first A is followed by A (not AU), but the second A is followed by U, giving one AU site.\n- Across codon boundaries: AUG→AAU gives GA; AAU→UGG gives UU; UGG→GGX gives GG.

By independence, the probability of no edits at all AU sites (and hence correct translation) is\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{success}} = (1 - p_{\\mathrm{edit}})^{n}.\n$$\nSubstituting $p_{\\mathrm{edit}} = 0.92$ and $n=2$,\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{success}} = (1 - 0.92)^{2} = 0.08^{2} = 0.0064.\n$$\nRounded to two significant figures, this is $6.4 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nNote on the glycine codon tie: although GGU and GGC are tied at 40 percent, both choices produce the same number of AU sites and thus the same success probability; the result is unaffected by the tie.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.4 \\times 10^{-3}}$$", "id": "2026523"}]}
