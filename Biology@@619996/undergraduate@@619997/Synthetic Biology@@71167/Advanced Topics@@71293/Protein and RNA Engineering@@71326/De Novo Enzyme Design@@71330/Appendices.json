{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey from a digital enzyme blueprint to a functioning biocatalyst is often met with practical challenges. A common and critical hurdle is protein insolubility, where the designed protein fails to fold correctly or aggregates upon expression in a host organism. This exercise tackles this very problem, forcing us to think beyond the active site and consider the overall physicochemical properties of the protein, particularly its surface chemistry. By learning to diagnose and propose solutions for insolubility, you gain a crucial skill in translating computational designs into tangible, functional enzymes [@problem_id:2029207].", "problem": "A bioengineering student is working on a *de novo* enzyme design project. Using computational modeling, she has designed a small, single-domain protein with a predicted stable fold and a novel active site. The design relies on a tightly packed hydrophobic core to maintain structural integrity and a specific arrangement of polar residues in a surface cleft to perform catalysis. When the gene for this enzyme is expressed in a standard *Escherichia coli* host, the protein is produced at high levels but is found to be completely insoluble, forming aggregates known as inclusion bodies.\n\nAssuming the computational model of the folded structure is accurate, the student hypothesizes that the insolubility is due to unfavorable surface properties rather than an unstable fold. She aims to improve solubility by making a single amino acid substitution. This change must have the highest probability of increasing the protein's solubility in an aqueous environment while being least likely to disrupt the folded core's stability.\n\nWhich of the following single amino acid substitutions represents the most effective and safest strategy to achieve this goal?\n\nA. Replace a surface Leucine with an Arginine.\n\nB. Replace a surface Aspartate with an Alanine.\n\nC. Replace a core Valine with a Tryptophan.\n\nD. Replace a surface Serine with a Threonine.\n\nE. Replace a core Glycine with a Proline.", "solution": "We interpret the phenotype (high-level expression, insolubility, inclusion bodies) as aggregation driven by unfavorable surface properties rather than a misfolded or unstable core, consistent with the assumption that the designed fold is accurate. Aggregation of newly synthesized polypeptides in bacteria often arises from exposed hydrophobic patches on the protein surface, which promote intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. A robust strategy to improve solubility without disrupting the folded core is therefore to increase surface polarity/charge and reduce exposed hydrophobicity, while avoiding changes to core packing.\n\nPrinciples to apply:\n- Hydrophobic effect and residue distribution: Correctly folded water-soluble proteins bury hydrophobic residues (e.g., Leu, Val, Ile, Phe) in the core and present polar/charged residues on the surface. Exposed hydrophobic residues on the surface increase aggregation propensity.\n- Mutational tolerance by location: Surface residues are generally more tolerant to substitutions; core residues require precise packing, and perturbations often destabilize the fold.\n- Improving solubility: Introducing or increasing surface charge/polarity (e.g., Lys, Arg, Asp, Glu) and removing surface hydrophobics reduces aggregation propensity. “Supercharging” via additional surface charges can enhance solubility by promoting electrostatic repulsion between protein molecules and favorable hydration.\n- Risk minimization: Avoid mutations in the hydrophobic core and avoid substitutions that reduce surface charge or increase surface hydrophobicity.\n\nEvaluate each option:\nA. Replace a surface Leucine (hydrophobic) with an Arginine (positively charged, highly solvated, capable of multiple hydrogen bonds and salt bridges). This directly reduces exposed hydrophobicity and increases favorable surface charge, strongly increasing solubility. Because the change is on the surface, it is least likely to disrupt core packing or global fold.\nB. Replace a surface Aspartate (negatively charged) with an Alanine (hydrophobic). This decreases surface charge and increases hydrophobic character, worsening solubility and increasing aggregation propensity. Contraindicated.\nC. Replace a core Valine with a Tryptophan. This substantially alters side-chain size and shape in the core, likely disrupting tight packing, creating steric clashes or cavities elsewhere, and destabilizing the fold. High risk with no solubility benefit.\nD. Replace a surface Serine with a Threonine. This is a conservative polar-to-polar substitution with minimal effect on solubility; while generally safe, it does not address exposed hydrophobic patches and thus has a low probability of significantly improving solubility.\nE. Replace a core Glycine with a Proline. Proline imposes conformational constraints on the backbone and can disrupt secondary structure and tight turns; Glycine often occupies conformationally restricted regions. This is high risk for destabilizing the fold.\n\nConclusion: The substitution that maximally increases solubility while minimizing risk to the folded core is replacing a surface hydrophobic residue with a charged residue. Among the options, replacing a surface Leucine with an Arginine best fits this strategy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2029207"}, {"introduction": "Once a soluble *de novo* enzyme has been successfully expressed and purified, the pivotal moment arrives: testing for catalytic activity.
