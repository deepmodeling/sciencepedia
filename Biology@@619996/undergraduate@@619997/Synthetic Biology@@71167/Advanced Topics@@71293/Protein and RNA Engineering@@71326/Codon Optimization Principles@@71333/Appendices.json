The efficiency of protein translation is heavily influenced by codon usage bias, where the host organism shows a preference for certain codons over others for the same amino acid. The presence of \"rare\" codons, those used infrequently by the host, can lead to ribosome stalling and significantly reduce protein yield. The team hypothesizes that a cluster of consecutive rare codons is a major bottleneck.\n\nYour task is to identify the highest-priority site for codon optimization within a specific segment of the `gfpX` gene.
