{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The concept of protein domains as modular units is powerful because it allows us to make educated predictions about a protein's function, even before it's studied in a lab. By identifying known domains, such as those that direct a protein to a specific cellular compartment or enable it to bind DNA, we can piece together a functional hypothesis. This exercise challenges you to apply this logic by deducing the role and location of a hypothetical protein based on its predicted domains [@problem_id:2332920].", "problem": "In a study of protein function within a eukaryotic cell line, researchers identify a novel protein they name \"Regulon-X\". Through bioinformatic analysis of its amino acid sequence, they predict the presence of two distinct and well-characterized structural regions or motifs within the protein:\n\n1.  A **Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS)**, which is a short sequence of amino acids that serves as a tag for targeting proteins for import into the cell nucleus from the cytoplasm.\n2.  A **DNA-Binding Domain (DBD)**, which is a protein structural motif that exhibits a high affinity for binding to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA).\n\nBased on the presence of these two domains, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary subcellular location and general function of the Regulon-X protein?\n\nA. Located in the nucleus; functions as a regulator of gene expression.\n\nB. Located in the cytoplasm; functions by degrading viral DNA that enters the cell.\n\nC. Located within the rough endoplasmic reticulum; functions to assist in the folding of newly synthesized proteins.\n\nD. Secreted from the cell; functions as a hormone to signal other cells.\n\nE. Embedded in the plasma membrane; functions as an ion channel.", "solution": "Identify the implications of the predicted motifs. A Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) is a targeting sequence that directs a protein to the nucleus via the importin pathway, indicating the primary subcellular location is the nucleus. A DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) confers the ability to directly bind DNA, a hallmark of transcription factors and other nuclear regulators of gene expression.\n\nMatch these implications to the options. Option A states nuclear localization and regulation of gene expression, which directly follows from the presence of an NLS and a DBD. Option B suggests a cytoplasmic location and viral DNA degradation; this would require nuclease activity and does not align with an NLS or a DBD geared toward genomic DNA regulation. Option C suggests ER localization and protein folding; ER-resident chaperones typically have an N-terminal signal peptide and ER retention signals (for example, KDEL), not an NLS or a DBD. Option D suggests secretion and hormonal function, which would require a signal peptide for the secretory pathway, not an NLS or a DBD. Option E suggests a plasma membrane ion channel, which would feature multiple transmembrane domains, not a DBD nor an NLS.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that Regulon-X localizes to the nucleus and functions as a regulator of gene expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2332920"}, {"introduction": "Building on the idea of predictive domains, we now consider a more complex scenario: what happens when a protein is engineered with multiple targeting signals? A cell is not a well-mixed bag of components; its trafficking pathways are highly organized in space and time. This thought experiment asks you to resolve the outcome of seemingly conflicting signals by considering the specific cellular machinery and logic that governs where a protein ultimately ends up [@problem_id:2059401].", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is designing a novel fluorescent reporter protein for use in mammalian cells. They start with the sequence for a standard Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). To control its location, they genetically fuse two different signal peptides to it:\n1.  An N-terminal Mitochondrial Targeting Signal (MTS), which directs proteins to the mitochondrial matrix.\n2.  An internal, leucine-rich Nuclear Export Signal (NES), which is recognized by exportin proteins to move cargo from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.\n\nThe final engineered protein is too large to diffuse passively through the nuclear pore complex. Assuming all signals are properly folded and functional, and the cell's protein trafficking machinery is operating normally, what is the most likely primary, steady-state location of this engineered GFP?\n\nA. The protein will be found exclusively in the nucleus.\n\nB. The protein will be found exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nC. The protein will be found diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm.\n\nD. The protein will be continuously shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.\n\nE. The protein will be degraded immediately upon synthesis due to conflicting signals.\n\nF. The protein will be found at the outer mitochondrial membrane, but not imported.", "solution": "The engineered protein contains two distinct trafficking signals whose mechanisms must be evaluated in order. An N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) is an amphipathic helix recognized post-translationally in the cytosol by receptors of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM complex), followed by transfer through the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM complex), resulting in import into the mitochondrial matrix. This pathway requires that the protein be synthesized in the cytosol and remain import-competent; under normal conditions and with a properly folded signal, the MTS is sufficient and dominant for delivery to the mitochondrial matrix, where such targeting signals are often cleaved and the protein accumulates at steady state.\n\nThe internal leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) is recognized by exportin (CRM1) in the presence of Ran-GTP, but this pathway only functions on cargo that is already inside the nucleus. The NES does not mediate nuclear import. Nuclear entry of large proteins requires a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to engage importins; passive diffusion is ruled out here by the stated size constraint. Because the engineered protein lacks an NLS and is too large to diffuse through the nuclear pore complex, it will not enter the nucleus, rendering the NES functionally irrelevant in determining initial localization.\n\nGiven that all signals are functional and the cell’s trafficking machinery operates normally, the MTS will direct the protein from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix. There is no basis for exclusive nuclear localization, cytoplasmic diffusion, continuous nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, immediate degradation due to conflicting signals, or stalling at the outer membrane under these assumptions. Therefore, the most likely primary, steady-state location is the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2059401"}, {"introduction": "Bioinformatic predictions are invaluable for generating hypotheses, but they must be confirmed with experimental evidence. How can we definitively determine which of several potential motifs is the one responsible for a protein's function? This final practice places you in the role of an experimental biologist, tasking you with interpreting data from a co-immunoprecipitation experiment to pinpoint the dominant functional signal within a protein, a foundational skill in molecular and cell biology [@problem_id:2066201].", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of a newly discovered human protein, \"Shuttlin\". Sequence analysis of Shuttlin reveals three potential canonical leucine-rich Nuclear Export Signals (NESs), which are peptide motifs that target proteins for export from the nucleus via the exportin protein CRM1. These motifs conform to the degenerate consensus sequence `Φ-X-X-X-Φ-X-X-Φ-X-Φ`, where `Φ` is a large hydrophobic residue (L, I, V, F, or M) and `X` is any amino acid. The three potential NES motifs are located at different positions in the protein sequence.\n\nTo determine which of these motifs is the functionally dominant NES, the researcher performs an experiment using site-directed mutagenesis and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Four constructs are created, each encoding a version of Shuttlin fused to a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) tag at its C-terminus:\n1.  **WT**: Wild-Type Shuttlin-GFP.\n2.  **Mut1**: Shuttlin-GFP where the four key hydrophobic residues (`Φ`) of the first potential NES motif have been mutated to alanine (A).\n3.  **Mut2**: Shuttlin-GFP where the four key hydrophobic residues (`Φ`) of the second potential NES motif have been mutated to alanine (A).\n4.  **Mut3**: Shuttlin-GFP where the four key hydrophobic residues (`Φ`) of the third potential NES motif have been mutated to alanine (A).\n\nEach construct is expressed in cultured human cells. The cells are then lysed, and the protein complexes are subjected to Co-IP using magnetic beads coated with anti-GFP antibodies. The immunoprecipitated material (the \"pull-down\") is then separated by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by western blot using an antibody specific for the exportin protein CRM1.\n\nThe western blot analysis of the co-immunoprecipitated samples yields the following results, with band intensity representing the amount of CRM1 pulled down:\n-   **WT Pull-down**: A strong, distinct band for CRM1 is observed.\n-   **Mut1 Pull-down**: A strong, distinct band for CRM1 is observed, with an intensity comparable to the WT.\n-   **Mut2 Pull-down**: No detectable band for CRM1 is observed.\n-   **Mut3 Pull-down**: A weak, but detectable, band for CRM1 is observed, with an intensity significantly less than the WT but greater than zero.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following conclusions is the most accurate?\n\nA. Motif 1 is the sole functional NES for Shuttlin.\n\nB. Motif 2 is the sole functional NES for Shuttlin.\n\nC. Motif 1 and Motif 2 work together cooperatively as the functional NES.\n\nD. Motif 2 is the primary functional NES, while Motif 3 plays a secondary, minor role in CRM1 binding.\n\nE. Motif 3 is the primary functional NES, while Motif 2 plays a secondary, minor role in CRM1 binding.\n\nF. All three motifs are redundant and contribute equally to nuclear export.", "solution": "The experimental logic is as follows: CRM1 recognizes leucine-rich Nuclear Export Signals (NESs) on cargo proteins. In a Co-IP using anti-GFP to pull down Shuttlin-GFP variants, the presence and intensity of a CRM1 band on the western blot reflect the ability of that Shuttlin variant to bind CRM1. Mutating the key hydrophobic residues in a functional NES should reduce or abolish CRM1 binding. Therefore:\n- If mutating a motif’s hydrophobic residues leads to a loss of CRM1 in the pull-down, that motif is necessary for CRM1 binding and thus functionally important.\n- If mutating a motif’s hydrophobic residues does not change CRM1 binding relative to wild type, that motif is dispensable for CRM1 binding under these conditions.\n- If mutating a motif reduces but does not abolish CRM1 binding, that motif contributes to binding but is not the primary determinant.\n\nApply this to the results:\n1. WT shows a strong CRM1 band, confirming that Shuttlin interacts with CRM1 via one or more NESs.\n2. Mut1 shows a strong band comparable to WT, indicating that mutating the first motif does not impair CRM1 binding. Thus, Motif 1 is not required for CRM1 interaction and is unlikely to be the dominant functional NES.\n3. Mut2 shows no detectable CRM1 band, indicating that mutating the second motif abolishes CRM1 binding. Therefore, Motif 2 is necessary and is the primary functional NES for CRM1 interaction.\n4. Mut3 shows a weak but detectable CRM1 band, indicating partial reduction of binding. Thus, Motif 3 contributes to CRM1 binding but is not essential; it plays a secondary or minor role.\n\nEvaluate options against these deductions:\n- A is false because mutation of Motif 1 does not reduce CRM1 binding.\n- B is too strong because although Motif 2 is necessary, the reduced binding in Mut3 implies Motif 3 also contributes; hence Motif 2 is not the sole contributor.\n- C is false because Motif 1 mutation has no effect, so cooperation between Motif 1 and Motif 2 is not supported.\n- D is consistent with the data: Motif 2 is primary (loss eliminates binding), and Motif 3 is secondary (loss reduces but does not abolish binding).\n- E contradicts the loss of binding upon Mut2.\n- F is false because the three motifs are not equal in contribution; Motif 2 is dominant, Motif 3 minor, Motif 1 dispensable.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that Motif 2 is the primary functional NES, while Motif 3 has a secondary, minor role in CRM1 binding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2066201"}]}
