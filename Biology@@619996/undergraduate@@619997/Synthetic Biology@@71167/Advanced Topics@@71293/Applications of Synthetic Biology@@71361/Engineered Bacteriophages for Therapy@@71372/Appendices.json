A key challenge is programming a phage to specifically recognize a desired bacterial host while avoiding others. Consider a wild-type (WT) bacteriophage that can bind to two different outer membrane porins on the surface of an *E. coli* strain: OmpC and OmpF.\n\nA researcher aims to computationally guide the engineering of this phage's tail fiber protein to switch its binding preference. The goal is to modify the phage so that it preferentially binds to OmpF instead of OmpC. We will model the binding events as reaching a thermodynamic equilibrium in which the phage (P) competitively binds to the surface receptors OmpC (C) and OmpF (F). For the purpose of this model, assume the surface concentrations of OmpC and OmpF porins on the bacterial cell are equal. The engineering modifications are designed to only alter the binding affinity for OmpF, leaving the interaction with OmpC unaffected.\n\nAt a physiological temperature of $310$ K, the Gibbs free energy of binding for the WT phage to its receptors are:\n- Phage-OmpC binding: $\\Delta G_{C,\\text{wt}} = -55.0$ kJ/mol\n- Phage-OmpF binding: $\\Delta G_{F,\\text{wt}} = -40.0$ kJ/mol\n\nThe engineering objective is to achieve a state where, at equilibrium, the number of phages bound to OmpF is 100 times greater than the number of phages bound to OmpC.\n\nUsing the ideal gas constant $R = 8.314 \\times 10^{-3}$ kJ/(mol·K), calculate the necessary change in the Gibbs free energy of binding for the phage-OmpF interaction ($\\Delta G_{F,\\text{eng}} - \\Delta G_{F,\\text{wt}}$) to meet this objective.

The original, wild-type phage, `Phage-WT`, is highly effective at infecting a non-pathogenic laboratory host, `Strain-S`, but shows negligible activity against `Strain-R`. The engineering strategy focuses on modifying the phage's tail fiber proteins to switch its host preference from `Strain-S` to `Strain-R`.\n\nAfter performing genetic modifications, the team has produced three promising engineered variants: `Phage-E1`, `Phage-E2`, and `Phage-E3`. To evaluate their success, they conduct quantitative plaque assays. This involves preparing separate agar plates with a uniform lawn of each bacterial strain (`Strain-S` and `Strain-R`) and then applying serial dilutions of each phage stock to determine the concentration of infectious particles. This concentration, or titer, is measured in Plaque-Forming Units per milliliter (PFU/mL).
