By mapping the flow of carbons, you will build a mental model of how PKS modules collaborate to construct complex backbones.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is designing an engineered modular Polyketide Synthase (PKS) to produce a novel linear molecule. The design specifies a loading module that utilizes propionyl-Coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA) as the starter unit. This is followed by three extension modules arranged sequentially. Each of these three extension modules is programmed to incorporate one molecule of malonyl-CoA as the extender unit. Critically, these extension modules contain only the minimal set of catalytic domains required for chain elongation (Ketosynthase, Acyltransferase, and Acyl Carrier Protein) and lack any domains for ketoreduction, dehydration, or enoyl reduction. The process is terminated by a thioesterase domain that hydrolyzes the final polyketide chain from the PKS, yielding a linear carboxylic acid.\n\nBased on this design, which of the following statements accurately describes the chemical structure of the final linear polyketide product?\n\nA. A linear nine-carbon chain containing a terminal carboxylic acid and ketone groups at the C-3, C-5, and C-7 positions (numbering from the carboxylic acid carbon as C-1).\n\nB.

A linear nine-carbon chain containing a terminal carboxylic acid and ketone groups at the C-2, C-4, and C-6 positions.", "solution": "The problem asks for the structure of a polyketide synthesized by a specific modular Polyketide Synthase (PKS). We can determine this structure by tracking the assembly process step-by-step, from the starter unit through each extension module.\n\n**Step 1: The Starter Unit**\nThe process begins at the loading module, which primes the PKS with a starter unit. The specified starter unit is propionyl-CoA. The propionyl group, which is a three-carbon acyl group ($CH_3-CH_2-CO-$), is loaded onto the PKS. This forms the initial segment of the growing polyketide chain.\nChain after loading: $CH_3-CH_2-CO-S-PKS$\n\n**Step 2: First Extension Module**\nThe first extension module performs a Claisen condensation. The Acyltransferase (AT) domain of this module loads a malonyl-CoA extender unit. Malonyl-CoA contributes a three-carbon malonate group ($HOOC-CH_2-CO-$). The Ketosynthase (KS) domain then catalyzes the condensation reaction between the propionyl group (from the loading module) and the malonyl group. This condensation is accompanied by the decarboxylation (loss of $CO_2$) of the malonyl group. Thus, each malonyl-CoA extender unit effectively adds a two-carbon unit (an acetyl group, $-CH_2-CO-$) to the growing chain.\n- Starter chain: $CH_3-CH_2-CO-S-PKS$\n- Extender unit added: $-CH_2-CO-$\n- Chain after 1st extension: $CH_3-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-S-PKS$\nThis condensation creates a $\\beta$-keto group. The problem states that there are no reductive domains (Ketoreductase, Dehydratase, Enoylreductase), so this ketone is not modified. The chain now has $3 + 2 = 5$ carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Second Extension Module**\nThe 5-carbon chain is passed to the second extension module. This module repeats the same process: it loads another malonyl-CoA, which adds another two-carbon unit via a decarboxylative Claisen condensation.\n- Chain before 2nd extension: $CH_3-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-S-PKS$\n- Extender unit added: $-CH_2-CO-$\n- Chain after 2nd extension: $CH_3-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-S-PKS$\nAgain, a new $\\beta$-keto group is formed and remains unmodified. The chain length is now $5 + 2 = 7$ carbons.\n\n**Step 4: Third Extension Module**\nThe 7-carbon chain is passed to the third and final extension module. The process is repeated one last time.\n- Chain before 3rd extension: $CH_3-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-S-PKS$\n- Extender unit added: $-CH_2-CO-$\n- Chain after 3rd extension: $CH_3-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-S-PKS$\nThe final chain attached to the PKS now contains $7 + 2 = 9$ carbons. It has three unmodified ketone groups.\n\n**Step 5: Termination**\nA thioesterase (TE) domain hydrolyzes the thioester bond, releasing the final product from the PKS as a free carboxylic acid.\n- Final chain on PKS: $CH_3-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-S-PKS$\n- Released product: $CH_3-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-CH_2-COOH$\n\n**Step 6: Analyzing the Final Structure**\nThe final product is $CH_3-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-CH_2-CO-CH_2-COOH$. Let's analyze its features:\n- **Total Carbons:** The starter unit provided 3 carbons. Each of the three extension modules added 2 carbons ($3 \\times 2 = 6$). The total number of carbons in the final molecule is $3 + 6 = 9$.\n- **Functional Groups:** The chain is terminated by a carboxylic acid group ($-COOH$). Due to the lack of reductive domains, each of the three extension steps resulted in a ketone group ($-CO-$).\n- **Position of Ketones:** According to IUPAC nomenclature, we number the carbon chain starting from the carboxylic acid carbon as C-1. The ketone groups are located at positions C-3, C-5, and C-7.\n\n**Step 7: Comparing with Options**\n- **A:** A linear nine-carbon chain with a terminal carboxylic acid and ketones at C-3, C-5, and C-7. This matches our derived structure perfectly.\n- **B:** Incorrectly states a twelve-carbon chain. This would happen if one mistakenly assumes that malonyl-CoA adds three carbons instead of two.\n- **C:** Incorrectly states an eight-carbon chain. This would result from using an acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) starter unit instead of propionyl-CoA ($2 + 3 \\times 2 = 8$).\n- **D:** Incorrectly states the chain is saturated. This would happen if all ketone groups were fully reduced, which is explicitly ruled out.\n- **E:** States the correct carbon count but incorrect ketone positions (C-2, C-4, C-6). This is mechanistically incorrect, as the Claisen condensation always forms a $\\beta$-ketoacyl intermediate, placing the new ketone at the C-3 position relative to the thioester.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is given in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2055266"}, {"introduction": "Beyond creating the carbon backbone, PKS modules can precisely tailor a molecule's chemical properties through reductive modifications.

The synthesis pathway is designed to start with one molecule of acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) as the \"starter unit,\" which provides the initial two carbons of the chain. The fatty acid chain is then extended by the sequential addition of two-carbon units derived from malonyl-Coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) \"extender units.\" For the fatty acid to be fully saturated, each newly added keto group must be completely reduced to a methylene group ($-CH_2-$). This full reduction in each elongation module is catalyzed by a ketoreductase, a dehydratase, and an enoyl reductase domain, and it consumes the cofactor Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) as the reducing agent.\n\nDetermine the total number of malonyl-CoA molecules and the total number of NADPH molecules required for the complete synthesis of one molecule of the 12-carbon saturated fatty acid from the initial acetyl-CoA starter unit.

The ketoreductase consumes $1$ NADPH and the enoyl reductase consumes $1$ NADPH, while the dehydratase consumes none. Therefore, each elongation cycle consumes $2$ NADPH. If $n=5$ cycles are performed, the total NADPH required is\n$n_{\\text{NADPH}}=2n=2\\times 5=10$.\n\nThus, the total requirements are $5$ malonyl-CoA molecules and $10$ NADPH molecules.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}5 & 10\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2055263"}, {"introduction": "In synthetic biology, experiments don't always proceed as planned, and understanding potential failure modes is a key engineering skill.

The wild-type PKS is known to initiate biosynthesis with an acetyl-CoA starter unit and consists of two elongation modules followed by a terminal thioesterase (TE) domain for product release.\n\nThe domain organization is as follows:\n- **Loading Domain:** Utilizes acetyl-CoA.\n- **Module 1:** Comprises Ketosynthase (KS), Acyltransferase (AT), Ketoreductase (KR), and Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP) domains. The AT domain is specific for loading methylmalonyl-CoA as the extender unit, and the KR domain is fully active.\n- **Module 2:** Comprises KS, AT, and ACP domains.

It lacks any reductive domains (KR, Dehydratase, Enoylreductase).\n\nThe researcher constructs a mutant version of this PKS in which the AT domain of Module 2 (AT$_2$) is rendered catalytically inactive through site-directed mutagenesis. This engineered PKS is expressed in a host organism that provides an ample supply of all necessary precursors: acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and methylmalonyl-CoA.\n\nDue to the engineered inactivation, the polyketide chain, after being synthesized by Module 1, is successfully transferred to the KS domain of Module 2, but the biosynthesis stalls because no extender unit can be loaded onto the ACP of Module 2. It is observed that the stalled acyl-KS intermediate is prematurely released from the enzyme, predominantly via hydrolysis of the thioester bond.\n\nBased on this information, what is the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for the major offloaded chemical product?\n\nA. 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic acid\n\nB. 5-hydroxy-4-methyl-3-oxohexanoic acid\n\nC. 3-methyl-2-butanol\n\nD. 3-hydroxybutanoic acid\n\nE. 2-methyl-3-oxobutanoic acid\n\nF. 3,4-dimethyloxetan-2-one", "solution": "The loading domain transfers an acetyl starter to the enzyme, generating an acetyl group on the first ketosynthase (KS1), written as $S-KS1-C(=O)-CH_3$.\n\nIn Module 1, the acyltransferase AT1 loads methylmalonyl-CoA onto ACP1. KS1 catalyzes a decarboxylative Claisen condensation between the acetyl-KS1 thioester and the methylmalonyl-ACP1 extender. This yields a beta-ketoacyl-ACP1 bearing an alpha-methyl substituent. Structurally, the newly formed ACP-bound product has the thioester carbonyl at the ACP end and a beta-keto at the position two carbons away, with an alpha-methyl branch: $O=C-CH(CH_3)-C(=O)-CH_3$, i.e., a 3-oxo-2-methylbutanoyl-ACP.\n\nThe KR domain in Module 1 is fully active and reduces the beta-keto group to a beta-hydroxyl. Therefore, the ACP1-bound intermediate after Module 1 is the beta-hydroxyacyl thioester with structure $O=C-CH(CH_3)-CH(OH)-CH_3$, i.e., 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoyl-ACP.\n\nThis reduced intermediate is then translocated to the KS of Module 2 (KS2), forming the corresponding KS-bound thioester $S-KS2-C(=O)-CH(CH_3)-CH(OH)-CH_3$.\n\nBecause AT2 is catalytically inactive, no malonyl extender is loaded onto ACP2, so chain elongation in Module 2 cannot occur. The acyl-KS2 intermediate stalls and is offloaded predominantly via hydrolysis of the thioester bond, yielding the free carboxylic acid corresponding to the KS2-bound acyl chain. Hydrolysis of $S-KS2-C(=O)-CH(CH_3)-CH(OH)-CH_3$ gives $HOOC-CH(CH_3)-CH(OH)-CH_3$, which is 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic acid.\n\nAmong the options, this corresponds to option A. Options D and E would arise if Module 1 used malonyl-CoA (no methyl branch) or if KR were inactive (beta-keto not reduced), respectively; neither matches the stated module specificities and activities. The other options do not correspond to an acid offloaded after a single methylmalonyl extension followed by KR reduction.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name for the major offloaded product is 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2055218"}]}
