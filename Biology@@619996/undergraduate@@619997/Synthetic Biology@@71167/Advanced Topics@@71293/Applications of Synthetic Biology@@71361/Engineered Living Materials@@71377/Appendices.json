This exercise [@problem_id:2034620] tests your understanding of a classic inducible system, the arabinose-controlled $pBAD$ promoter, and its regulatory protein, AraC. It underscores a critical principle in synthetic biology: a successful design depends not only on the engineered plasmid but also on the genetic context of the host cell.", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists aims to create an \"on-demand\" engineered living material using the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. The goal is to have the bacteria produce a structural biofilm only when a specific chemical inducer is present in their growth medium. To achieve this, they construct a plasmid containing the gene `csgA`, which codes for the primary protein subunit of curli fibers responsible for biofilm formation. The expression of `csgA` is placed under the control of the arabinose-inducible promoter, pBAD.\n\nThe pBAD system functions as follows:\n- The protein AraC is a transcriptional activator.\n- In the presence of the sugar L-arabinose, AraC binds to the pBAD promoter and activates the transcription of the downstream gene (`csgA` in this case).\n- In the absence of L-arabinose, the AraC protein does not activate the pBAD promoter.\n\nThe engineered plasmid is successfully transformed into a special strain of *E. coli*. However, unknown to the researchers, this particular *E. coli* strain harbors a mutation that results in a complete loss-of-function of its native `araC` gene, meaning no functional AraC protein is produced by the cell.\n\nWhat is the expected phenotype of this engineered *E. coli* strain when it is grown in a liquid medium supplemented with a high concentration of L-arabinose?\n\nA. The bacteria will form a robust biofilm constitutively, both with and without L-arabinose.\n\nB. The bacteria will form a robust biofilm only in the presence of L-arabinose.\n\nC. The bacteria will be unable to form a biofilm, regardless of the presence of L-arabinose.\n\nD. The bacteria will lyse due to the toxic overexpression of the CsgA protein.\n\nE. The bacteria will metabolize the L-arabinose but will otherwise behave identically to a wild-type strain without the plasmid.", "solution": "The regulatory logic of the pBAD system is as follows: activation of transcription from the pBAD promoter requires the transcription factor AraC bound to L-arabinose. Specifically, AraC in complex with L-arabinose binds to the pBAD promoter region and recruits RNA polymerase to initiate transcription of the downstream gene. In the absence of L-arabinose, AraC does not activate pBAD, and transcription remains off or at very low basal levels.\n\nIn the engineered construct, the gene under pBAD control is csgA, encoding the main subunit of curli fibers required for robust biofilm formation. Robust biofilm formation therefore requires activated transcription from pBAD, which in turn requires functional AraC protein.\n\nThe host strain has a complete loss-of-function mutation in its native araC gene, meaning no functional AraC protein is produced. Without AraC, the pBAD promoter cannot be activated, even if L-arabinose is present at high concentration, because the activation mechanism specifically depends on the AraC-arabinose complex. Consequently, csgA expression will not be induced. Any basal leakiness, if present, would be insufficient for robust curli fiber assembly and biofilm formation as intended by the design.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotype is that the bacteria will be unable to form a robust biofilm, regardless of the presence of L-arabinose.\n\nAlternative options are inconsistent with the regulatory logic: constitutive expression (A) would require promoter activity without AraC; induction by L-arabinose (B) requires AraC; lysis due to toxic overexpression (D) presupposes strong expression that cannot occur without AraC; and arabinose metabolism as in wild type (E) is not guaranteed and is irrelevant to csgA expression from pBAD in the absence of AraC.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2034620"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple \"on-off\" logic, predicting the quantitative output of an engineered system is a key design step.

The bandage contains a strain of non-pathogenic bacteria, `E. vivens`, embedded within a hydrogel. This engineered bacterium is designed to detect the presence of a pathogenic species, `P. nocens`, and release a therapeutic protein in response.\n\nThe detection mechanism relies on a specific autoinducer (AI), a quorum-sensing molecule, secreted by `P. nocens`. The genetic circuit within `E. vivens` is designed such that the production rate of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) is activated by the AI. The rate of AMP production can be modeled using a Hill function that depends on the concentration of the AI. The AMP is also subject to natural degradation within the hydrogel.\n\nAssume the system operates under the following conditions:\n1.  The concentration of the AI secreted by the pathogen has reached a steady-state level of $[\\text{AI}] = 120 \\text{ nM}$.\n2.
