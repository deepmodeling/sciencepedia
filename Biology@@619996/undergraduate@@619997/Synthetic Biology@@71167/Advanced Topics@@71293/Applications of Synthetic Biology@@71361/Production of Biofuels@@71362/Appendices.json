This practice guides you through calculating the maximum theoretical yield of n-butanol from glucose by applying the principles of stoichiometric balancing. By ensuring redox cofactors like $NADH$ are in balance across competing metabolic routes, you can establish a vital performance benchmark for your engineered system [@problem_id:2057174].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology endeavor, a strain of bacteria is engineered to produce n-butanol ($C_4H_{10}O$) from glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) as the sole carbon source. The engineered metabolic network simplifies the cell's entire glucose catabolism into two distinct, competing routes: a Butanologenic Route for production and a Redox-Balancing Route for generating essential cofactors.\n\n1.  **Butanologenic Route**: A sequence of enzymatic reactions that convert glucose into n-butanol. This process can be described by the following two stages:\n    a) Glycolysis via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, where NAD$^+$ is the oxidized form and NADH is the reduced form of the cofactor Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide:\n    $$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 2 \\text{NAD}^+ + 2 \\text{ADP} + 2 P_i \\rightarrow 2 \\text{Pyruvate} + 2 \\text{NADH} + 2 H^+ + 2 \\text{ATP} + 2 H_2O$$\n    b) Conversion of pyruvate to n-butanol and byproducts through a modified fermentation pathway:\n    $$2 \\text{Pyruvate} + 4 \\text{NADH} + 4 H^+ \\rightarrow C_4H_{10}O + 2 CO_2 + H_2O + 4 \\text{NAD}^+$$\n\n2.  **Redox-Balancing Route**: To generate the reducing equivalents (NADH) needed by the Butanologenic Route, a fraction of the glucose is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide. The net reaction for this aerobic-like respiration process is:\n    $$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6 H_2O + 10 \\text{NAD}^+ \\rightarrow 6 CO_2 + 10 \\text{NADH} + 10 H^+$$\n\nAssuming the overall metabolism operates at a steady state where there is no net accumulation or depletion of NADH, calculate the maximum theoretical molar yield of n-butanol from glucose (defined as moles of n-butanol produced per mole of glucose consumed). All carbon from the consumed glucose must be accounted for in the products (n-butanol and carbon dioxide).\n\nExpress your answer as an exact fraction.", "solution": "Let $x$ be the moles of glucose processed by the Butanologenic Route (BR) and $y$ be the moles processed by the Redox-Balancing Route (RR), with the total glucose consumed normalized to one mole, so $x + y = 1$.\n\nFrom the given stoichiometry, we determine the net change of NADH for each route:\n- **Butanologenic Route (BR):** Per mole of glucose, glycolysis produces 2 moles of NADH, and the subsequent conversion step consumes 4 moles of NADH. This results in a net consumption of $4 - 2 = 2$ moles of NADH. The contribution to the NADH balance is therefore $-2x$.\n- **Redox-Balancing Route (RR):** This route generates 10 moles of NADH per mole of glucose. The contribution to the NADH balance is $+10y$.\n\nAt a steady state, there is no net accumulation of NADH, so the balances must sum to zero:\n$$-2x + 10y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = \\frac{1}{5}x.$$\n\nSubstitute this into the conservation equation $x + y = 1$:\n$$x + \\frac{1}{5}x = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{6}{5}x = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{5}{6}.$$\nThis means $y = 1 - x = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nThe Butanologenic Route produces 1 mole of n-butanol per mole of glucose it consumes. Since a fraction $x$ of the total glucose enters this route, the overall molar yield (moles of n-butanol produced per total moles of glucose consumed) is equal to $x$.\n$$Y_{\\text{butanol}/\\text{glucose}} = x = \\frac{5}{6}.$$\n\nCarbon accounting check to ensure feasibility:\n- Carbon in butanol: $4x = 4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{20}{6} = \\frac{10}{3}$.\n- Carbon in carbon dioxide (from BR and RR): $2x + 6y = 2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} + 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{10}{6} + 1 = \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{8}{3}$.\n- Total carbon out: $\\frac{10}{3} + \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6$, matching the 6 carbons of one mole of glucose.\n\nTherefore, the maximum theoretical molar yield is $\\frac{5}{6}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}$$", "id": "2057174"}, {"introduction": "With a theoretical yield established, the next step is to engineer a host organism by constructing the necessary genetic tools.

The provided yeast promoters are [P_TDH3] and [P_TEF1]; the provided yeast terminators are [T_CYC1] and [T_ADH1]. The bacterial promoter [P_lac] is not functional for transcription initiation by the yeast RNA polymerase II and therefore should not be used to drive expression in yeast.\n5) Each ORF should have its own complete expression cassette, i.e., [Yeast promoter - ORF - Yeast terminator], to ensure proper transcription termination and mRNA stability.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A includes [pUC ori], [AmpR] for E. coli propagation; [ARS/CEN] for yeast replication; [URA3] for selection in the ura3 deletion strain; and two complete yeast expression cassettes: [P_TDH3 - bldH ORF - T_CYC1] and [P_TEF1 - bdhB ORF - T_ADH1]. This satisfies all requirements.\n- Option B uses [P_lac] to drive bldH. Because [P_lac] is a bacterial promoter not recognized by yeast RNA polymerase II, bldH would not be expressed in yeast. Therefore, it is not a fully functional co-expression construct in yeast.\n- Option C lacks a terminator for the bdhB cassette. Absence of a proper yeast terminator compromises proper transcription termination and mRNA processing, so it is not a complete expression cassette and thus not fully functional by design criteria.\n- Option D omits [ARS/CEN]. Without a yeast origin/centromere, the plasmid will not be stably maintained in yeast as an autonomously replicating plasmid. Therefore, it is not a fully functional construct for the stated goal.\n- Option E lacks [URA3]. In the ura3 deletion host, this prevents selection for the plasmid in yeast, making the construct unsuitable for the specified strain and selection scheme.\n\nConclusion: Only option A meets all replication, selection, and expression requirements for co-expression of bldH and bdhB in the ura3 deletion Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2057175"}, {"introduction": "A common challenge in biofuel production is that the desired product is often toxic to the microbial host, placing a ceiling on production titers.
