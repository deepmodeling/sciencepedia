A CAR is a synthetic receptor protein engineered to be expressed on the surface of a T-cell. When a CAR binds to its specific target antigen on another cell, it triggers the T-cell to activate and kill the target cell.\n\nA major challenge in cancer therapy is tumor heterogeneity, where different cancer cells within the same tumor express different surface antigens. To address this, a single T-cell is engineered to simultaneously express two distinct CARs on its surface:\n1.  **CAR-A**: specifically recognizes and binds to Antigen A.\n2.  **CAR-B**: specifically recognizes and binds to Antigen B.\n\nThe T-cell's activation mechanism is designed such that binding of *either* CAR-A to Antigen A *or* CAR-B to Antigen B is sufficient to initiate a killing response.\n\nThis dual-CAR T-cell is introduced into a patient with a heterogeneous tumor containing three distinct subpopulations of cancer cells:\n-   **Population 1**: Expresses only Antigen A.\n-   **Population 2**: Expresses only Antigen B.\n-   **Population 3**: Expresses both Antigen A and Antigen B.\n\nHealthy host cells do not express either Antigen A or Antigen B.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the targeting capability of this engineered dual-CAR T-cell against the described tumor?\n\nA.

The engineered T-cell expresses two receptors: CAR-A that binds Antigen A, and CAR-B that binds Antigen B. The design stipulates an OR-gate activation, meaning the T-cell activates if either CAR-A binds A or CAR-B binds B. Using propositional logic, let $A$ denote the presence of Antigen A on a target cell and $B$ denote the presence of Antigen B. The activation condition is therefore $A \\lor B$.\n\nEvaluate each tumor subpopulation:\n- Population 1: expresses only Antigen A, so $A=\\text{true}$ and $B=\\text{false}$.

This therapy involves engineering a patient's T-cells to express CARs that recognize specific antigens on tumor cells. A major challenge is designing CARs that are highly effective against tumor cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues that may express the same antigen at lower levels, a phenomenon known as on-target, off-tumor toxicity.\n\nConsider a simplified model for CAR T-cell activation. The number of CAR-antigen bonds, $B$, formed at equilibrium when a T-cell interacts with a target cell is given by:\n$$B(C_{Ag}, K_D) = \\frac{N_{CAR} \\cdot C_{Ag}}{K_D + C_{Ag}}$$\nwhere:\n- $N_{CAR}$ is the total number of CARs on the T-cell surface.\n- $C_{Ag}$ is the surface density of the target antigen on the target cell (in $\\text{molecules}/\\mu\\text{m}^2$).\n- $K_D$ is the two-dimensional dissociation constant of the CAR for the antigen (in $\\text{molecules}/\\mu\\text{m}^2$), which is a measure of binding affinity (lower $K_D$ means higher affinity).\n\nA T-cell is activated and kills the target cell only if the number of bonds $B$ exceeds a critical threshold, $B_{crit}$. An ideal therapy must be both effective (kills tumor cells) and safe (does not kill healthy cells).

This exercise [@problem_id:2026100] models a critical trade-off in CAR T-cell design: the balance between high initial potency and long-term cell persistence, which is often limited by T-cell exhaustion. By calculating a 'crossover time,' you will discover how a moderate-strength promoter can lead to better overall effectiveness than a strong one, illustrating a key lesson in sustainable cellular engineering.", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, the design of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells for cancer therapy involves a critical choice of promoter to drive the expression of the CAR construct. A strong viral promoter, like the one from Cytomegalovirus (CMV), leads to high levels of CAR expression and potent initial anti-tumor activity. However, this high expression can also cause \"tonic signaling,\" a low-level, antigen-independent activation of the T-cell that leads to premature exhaustion and reduced long-term persistence. Conversely, a moderate-strength endogenous promoter, such as the Elongation Factor 1-alpha (EF1$\\alpha$) promoter, results in lower initial potency but may improve the long-term survival and function of the T-cells.\n\nTo quantify this trade-off, a research group develops a simplified mathematical model. The \"therapeutic effectiveness\" of the CAR T-cell population at any time $t$ is defined as the product of the average CAR expression level per cell and the number of surviving CAR T-cells.\n\nThe model assumes the following:\n1.  The average CAR expression level is directly proportional to the transcriptional strength of the chosen promoter, denoted by $k$.\n2.  The population of CAR T-cells, $N(t)$, which starts at an initial population $N_0$, decays over time due to a combination of basal apoptosis and exhaustion. The decay is modeled as an exponential process, $N(t) = N_0 \\exp(-\\delta t)$, where the decay rate constant, $\\delta$, depends on the promoter strength. Specifically, it is given by $\\delta = \\delta_0 + \\alpha k$, where $\\delta_0$ is the basal decay rate (independent of CAR expression) and the term $\\alpha k$ represents the additional decay due to tonic signaling-induced exhaustion. The parameter $\\alpha$ is the exhaustion coefficient.\n\nThe group has characterized the relative transcriptional strengths of the two promoters as $k_{\\text{CMV}} = 15.0$ and $k_{\\text{EF1}\\alpha} = 3.50$, in arbitrary strength units.
