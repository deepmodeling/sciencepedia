The bacteria are designed to produce a repair protein, $H$, in response to mechanical damage. The underlying genetic circuit is a coherent Type-1 Feed-Forward Loop (FFL).\n\nThe circuit operates as follows: A damage signal, $S$, is generated within the material upon stress. The presence of this signal initiates the synthesis of a regulatory protein, $X$. The concentration of $X$, denoted as $[X]$, evolves according to the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[X]}{dt} = \\alpha - \\gamma [X] $$\nwhere $t$ is time, $\\alpha$ is the constant production rate of $X$ while the signal $S$ is present, and $\\gamma$ is the first-order degradation rate constant for $X$.\n\nThe production of the repair protein $H$ is controlled by a promoter that functions like an AND gate: it is activated only when both the damage signal $S$ is present AND the concentration of the regulatory protein $X$ exceeds a specific threshold, $K_X$.\n\nAssuming the material is undamaged and at equilibrium before time $t=0$, so $[X](0)=0$. At $t=0$, the material is damaged, and the signal $S$ remains continuously present thereafter. Given that the system parameters are such that the steady-state concentration of $X$ is greater than the activation threshold (i.e., $\\alpha/\\gamma > K_X$), determine the time delay, $T_{delay}$, before the production of the repair protein $H$ begins.\n\nExpress your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\alpha$, $\\gamma$, and $K_X$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the time delay, $T_{delay}$, until the production of the repair protein $H$ begins. According to the problem description, this occurs when the concentration of the regulatory protein $X$ first reaches the threshold $K_X$, while the signal $S$ is active.\n\nThe dynamics of the concentration of $X$, denoted $[X](t)$, are given by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[X]}{dt} = \\alpha - \\gamma [X] $$\nThe initial condition is that the concentration of $X$ is zero at time $t=0$, so $[X](0) = 0$.\n\nWe need to solve this differential equation to find $[X](t)$. We can rearrange the equation to separate variables:\n$$ \\frac{d[X]}{\\alpha - \\gamma [X]} = dt $$\n\nNow, we integrate both sides.
