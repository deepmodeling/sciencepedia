The production pathway's efficiency is limited by a native competing metabolic pathway that consumes a shared precursor. To address this, the team has designed a genetic regulatory circuit to dynamically suppress the competing pathway.\n\nThe circuit consists of a DNA construct that expresses a single RNA molecule containing both a riboswitch and a small RNA (sRNA). The system is designed as follows:\n1.  An intermediate metabolite, denoted by $I$, which is specific to the desired production pathway, acts as an input signal.\n2.  The intermediate $I$ binds to the riboswitch aptamer on the transcribed RNA. This binding event prevents the formation of a transcriptional terminator, allowing the transcription of the full-length sRNA, denoted by $S$.\n3.  The sRNA, $S$, is designed to be complementary to the messenger RNA (mRNA) of a key enzyme in the competing pathway. This target mRNA is denoted by $M$.\n4.  Binding of the sRNA to the target mRNA leads to the rapid and irreversible degradation of the mRNA-sRNA complex by cellular nucleases.\n\nThe dynamics of the concentrations of the sRNA, $[S]$, and the target mRNA, $[M]$, can be described by the following differential equations, based on a simplified kinetic model:\n$$\n\\frac{d[S]}{dt} = P_S - \\delta_S [S] - k_{bind}[S][M]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[M]}{dt} = k_M - \\delta_M [M] - k_{bind}[S][M]\n$$\nHere, the production rate of the sRNA, $P_S$, is dependent on the concentration of the intermediate, $[I]$, according to the riboswitch activation function:\n$$\nP_S = k_{S,max} \\frac{[I]}{K_D + [I]}\n$$\nThe parameters of the system have been characterized experimentally:\n- Maximum sRNA transcription rate, $k_{S,max} = 30.0 \\text{ nM/min}$\n- Dissociation constant for intermediate $I$ binding to the riboswitch, $K_D = 100 \\text{ nM}$\n- Basal transcription rate of the target mRNA, $k_M = 2.00 \\text{ nM/min}$\n- First-order degradation rate constant of the sRNA, $\\delta_S = 0.500 \\text{ min}^{-1}$\n- First-order degradation rate constant of the target mRNA, $\\delta_M = 0.100 \\text{ min}^{-1}$\n- Second-order rate constant for sRNA-mRNA binding and degradation, $k_{bind} = 0.0200 \\text{ nM}^{-1}\\text{min}^{-1}$\n\nThe concentration of the intermediate $I$ is held constant at $[I] = 200 \\text{ nM}$ due to the steady operation of the production pathway.
