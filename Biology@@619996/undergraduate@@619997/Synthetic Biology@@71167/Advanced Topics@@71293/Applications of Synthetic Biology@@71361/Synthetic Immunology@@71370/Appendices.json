This \"counter\" is based on a sequential genetic circuit. The core of the circuit consists of a strong constitutive promoter (`P_const`) followed by three sequential Recombinase-Addressable Gates (RAG-1, RAG-2, and RAG-3) and finally the gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which serves as a reporter for activation. The genetic layout is: `P_const -> RAG-1 -> RAG-2 -> RAG-3 -> GFP`.\n\nEach RAG contains a transcriptional terminator that prevents `P_const` from expressing any downstream genes. The cell's state is defined by the number of terminators that have been removed.\n- **State 0:** All three RAGs are intact. The cell is OFF.\n- **State 1:** The terminator in RAG-1 is removed. The cell is OFF.\n- **State 2:** The terminators in RAG-1 and RAG-2 are removed. The cell is OFF.\n- **State 3:** All three terminators are removed. `P_const` can now drive expression of the `GFP` gene. The cell is considered ON (activated) and fluoresces green.\n\nThe removal of each terminator is an irreversible event mediated by a specific recombinase enzyme (`Rec1`, `Rec2`, or `Rec3`). The expression of these recombinases is triggered by a signaling cascade initiated by an antigen encounter. The system is designed to be sequential:\n- A cell in **State 0** that encounters an antigen will express `Rec1`, which removes the terminator in RAG-1, causing the cell to transition to **State 1**.\n- A cell in **State 1** that encounters an antigen will express `Rec2`, which removes the terminator in RAG-2, causing the cell to transition to **State 2**.\n- A cell in **State 2** that encounters an antigen will express `Rec3`, which removes the terminator in RAG-3, causing the cell to transition to **State 3**.\n- A cell already in **State 3** remains in State 3 upon further antigen encounters.\n\nA researcher prepares a large population of these engineered cells.
