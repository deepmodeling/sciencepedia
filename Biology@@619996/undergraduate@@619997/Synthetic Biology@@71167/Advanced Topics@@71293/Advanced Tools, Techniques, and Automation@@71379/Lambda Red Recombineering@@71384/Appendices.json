The goal is to precisely replace the native chromosomal gene, `catG`, with a tetracycline resistance cassette, `tetA`.\n\nThe relevant physical parameters of the DNA sequences are as follows:\n- The length of the `catG` gene's coding sequence that will be replaced is 1150 base pairs (bp).\n- The length of the `tetA` cassette's coding sequence that is being inserted is 920 bp.\n- The linear DNA fragment used for recombination consists of the `tetA` cassette flanked by homology arms that match the sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the `catG` gene, ensuring that the 1150 bp of `catG` is exactly replaced by the 920 bp of `tetA`.\n\nTo verify that the recombination was successful, the biologist will screen individual colonies using colony Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The screening strategy employs a primer pair with the following characteristics:\n1.  A forward primer, `P_fwd`, which anneals to the *E. coli* chromosome at a position where its 3' end is exactly 310 bp upstream of the original `catG` start codon.\n2.  A reverse primer, `P_rev`, which anneals within the inserted `tetA` cassette. The 3' end of this primer is located 180 bp upstream from the 3' end of the `tetA` coding sequence.\n\nAssuming the Lambda Red recombineering was successful and the `catG` gene was correctly replaced by the `tetA` cassette, calculate the expected size of the PCR product.

Therefore, after recombination, the junction between the chromosome and the insert places the $5'$ end of `tetA` exactly at the original `catG` start position.\n\nThe forward primer $P_{\\text{fwd}}$ anneals with its $3'$ end located $310$ bp upstream of the original `catG` start.

A frequent outcome in recombineering is abundant growth on non-selective media but a complete absence of colonies on the selective plate. This practice problem [@problem_id:2046773] asks you to diagnose the most likely cause of this specific failure, reinforcing your understanding of each critical step in the recombineering protocol.", "problem": "A student in a synthetic biology lab is attempting to perform a gene knockout in *Escherichia coli* using the Lambda Red recombineering system. The objective is to replace a specific non-essential gene on the bacterial chromosome with a linear, double-stranded DNA cassette that contains a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin.\n\nThe standard protocol involves the following key stages:\n1.  Inducing the expression of the Lambda Red proteins (Exonuclease, Beta, and Gam) from a temperature-sensitive helper plasmid within the *E. coli* cells.\n2.  Harvesting the cells and making them electrocompetent.\n3.  Introducing the linear kanamycin resistance DNA cassette into the cells via electroporation.\n4.  Allowing the cells to recover for one hour in a rich, non-selective liquid medium to allow for recombination and expression of the resistance gene.\n5.  Plating a small, diluted aliquot of the cell culture onto a non-selective agar plate (Plate 1) to assess overall cell viability post-electroporation.\n6.  Plating the remainder of the culture onto a selective agar plate containing kanamycin (Plate 2) to select for cells that have successfully integrated the DNA cassette.\n\nAfter overnight incubation, the student observes that Plate 1 has a dense lawn of bacterial growth. However, Plate 2 is completely devoid of any colonies. Assuming the kanamycin resistance cassette was correctly designed with the appropriate homology arms and was not degraded before the experiment, which of the following options presents the most likely reason for this specific outcome?\n\nA. The *E. coli* strain used for the experiment was already resistant to kanamycin prior to the procedure.\n\nB. The electroporation step failed due to an equipment malfunction, resulting in the immediate death of all cells.\n\nC. The recovery period in non-selective medium was too short, preventing the cells from expressing the kanamycin resistance protein.\n\nD. The selective plates contained an incorrect antibiotic, such as ampicillin, to which the host strain is sensitive.\n\nE. The initial induction step was missed, and the Lambda Red proteins were not present in the cells during the experiment.", "solution": "We interpret the observations relative to each step and option:\n\n- Plate 1 (non-selective) has a dense lawn. This demonstrates that cells survived the electroporation and recovery, and that plating and media quality were adequate for growth. Therefore, immediate cell death from electroporation failure is inconsistent with the data.\n\n- If the strain were already kanamycin resistant prior to the procedure (Option A), then cells would grow on Plate 2; the absence of any colonies contradicts this, so A is unlikely.\n\n- If the electroporation step had failed due to equipment malfunction causing immediate death (Option B), Plate 1 would also lack growth. Because Plate 1 shows a dense lawn, B is inconsistent.\n\n- If the recovery period were too short to allow expression of the kanamycin resistance gene (Option C), then even correctly recombined cells might not survive selection. However, one hour is the standard and generally sufficient outgrowth period for expression of the common kanamycin resistance gene (e.g., aph), and complete absence of colonies is more parsimoniously explained by a failure to generate recombinants at all rather than a universal failure of expression after a standard recovery time. Thus C is less likely than E.\n\n- If the selective plates contained the wrong antibiotic (Option D), such as ampicillin, then sensitive cells would not grow, producing zero colonies on the “selective” plate. While this could produce the observed outcome, it is an external plate-preparation error not specific to recombineering and is generally less likely than a failure intrinsic to the recombineering process given that Plate 1 grew well and the protocol otherwise appears correct.\n\n- If the Lambda Red induction step was missed (Option E), the Red proteins (Exo, Beta, Gam) would not be present. In that case, linear double-stranded DNA introduced by electroporation is rapidly degraded by host nucleases (notably RecBCD, which Gam normally inhibits), and homologous recombination into the chromosome is extremely rare. Cells would remain kanamycin sensitive, yielding no colonies on Plate 2, while still growing robustly on Plate 1. This directly explains the observed outcome and is the most likely cause given the assumptions that the cassette design and integrity were correct.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason is that the induction step was missed and the Lambda Red proteins were absent (Option E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2046773"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond a simple \"yes/no\" outcome, a quantitative understanding of your experiment allows for systematic optimization.
