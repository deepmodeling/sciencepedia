They plan to introduce a single, specific point mutation into a gene that regulates protein expression. To achieve this, they are using a technique called Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE). The team starts with a liquid culture containing a total of $5.0 \\times 10^8$ viable bacterial cells. Based on previous experiments, the efficiency of a single MAGE cycle for introducing a specific mutation at the target genetic locus, known as the allelic replacement frequency, is $1.5\\%$.

This practice moves from theory to a realistic troubleshooting scenario, where you must act as a detective to diagnose why a MAGE experiment is not working.

However, the experiment consistently fails, with sequencing results showing a near-zero mutation incorporation rate. The researcher suspects that the inducible lambda Red recombination system (Gam, Beta, Exo proteins), which is essential for MAGE and is under the control of an L-arabinose inducible promoter, may not be functionally active despite following the standard induction protocol.\n\nTo diagnose the problem, a reporter system is designed. The *E. coli* strain containing the lambda Red system is transformed with a reporter plasmid, pReporter. This plasmid has two key features: a gene for chloramphenicol resistance ($Cm^R$) that serves as a stable plasmid marker, and a kanamycin resistance gene ($Kan^R$) that has been intentionally inactivated with a premature TAG stop codon ($Kan^R_{TAG}$). A single-stranded DNA repair oligonucleotide (oligo) is designed to revert the TAG codon back to a functional CAG codon, which would restore kanamycin resistance.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where a culture of cells carrying both the lambda Red system and the pReporter plasmid is split into two. One sample is induced with L-arabinose to express the recombination proteins, while the other serves as an uninduced control. Both cultures are then made electrocompetent and electroporated with the repair oligo. After a recovery period, serial dilutions of the cultures are plated to determine cell counts.\n\nThe following data were collected:\n\nFor the **induced sample** (with L-arabinose):\n- Plating $100 \\, \\mu\\text{L}$ of a $10^{-6}$ dilution onto agar with chloramphenicol resulted in an average of $152$ colonies.\n- Plating $100 \\, \\mu\\text{L}$ of a $10^{-4}$ dilution onto agar with chloramphenicol and kanamycin resulted in an average of $73$ colonies.\n\nFor the **uninduced sample** (without L-arabinose):\n- Plating $100 \\, \\mu\\text{L}$ of a $10^{-6}$ dilution onto agar with chloramphenicol resulted in an average of $148$ colonies.\n- Plating $100 \\, \\mu\\text{L}$ of a $10^{-1}$ dilution onto agar with chloramphenicol and kanamycin resulted in an average of $1$ colony.\n\nThe recombination efficiency is defined as the ratio of the concentration of recombinant cells (those that acquired kanamycin resistance) to the concentration of total viable plasmid-bearing cells.

This efficiency is defined as the ratio of the concentration of recombinant cells ($C_{recomb}$) to the concentration of total viable plasmid-bearing cells ($C_{total}$).\n\nFirst, we must determine the concentration of total viable cells and recombinant cells in the original culture from the plating data. The concentration of cells in the original culture (in Colony Forming Units per mL, CFU/mL) can be calculated using the formula:\n$$C = \\frac{N}{V_{plate} \\times D}$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of colonies counted, $V_{plate}$ is the volume plated, and $D$ is the dilution factor.\n\nThe problem provides the volume plated as $V_{plate} = 100 \\, \\mu\\text{L}$.

This final, advanced exercise challenges you to think beyond the current state-of-the-art by designing a novel MAGE system that overcomes this physical constraint. You will develop a quantitative model to argue for your design, showing how tethering the recombination machinery directly to the replication fork can dramatically enhance engineering efficiency.", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) is a powerful technique for introducing numerous genetic modifications into a bacterial population simultaneously. The process relies on electroporating short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides into cells expressing the Î»-Red recombination system. A key component of this system, the Beta protein, binds to the ssDNA oligos and facilitates their annealing to the exposed lagging strand at the DNA replication fork during cell division.\n\nA primary factor limiting the efficiency of conventional MAGE is the reliance on random diffusion. A Beta-ssDNA complex formed in the cytoplasm must diffuse and successfully encounter the transiently available single-stranded region at one of the cell's replication forks. To overcome this, a research group proposes an engineered system where the Beta protein is tethered directly to the replisome. They design a fusion protein by linking Beta to the C-terminus of DnaN, the protein that forms the sliding clamp which encircles DNA and is an integral part of the replication machinery.\n\nYour task is to develop a simplified quantitative model to compare the two systems. Derive an expression for the enhancement factor, $\\mathcal{E}$, defined as the ratio of the initial rate of successful oligo annealing in the engineered system (with Beta-DnaN fusions) to that in the traditional system (with free Beta protein).\n\nFor your model, use the following parameters and assumptions:\n\n**Parameters:**\n-   $N_B$: The total number of free Beta protein molecules expressed per cell in the traditional system.\n-   $N_{DN}$: The total number of Beta-DnaN fusion protein molecules expressed per cell in the engineered system, which are all successfully loaded onto the replisome.\n-   $N_O$: The total number of ssDNA oligo molecules introduced into the cell.\n-   $V_c$: The total cytoplasmic volume of the cell.\n-   $V_f$: The effective reaction volume associated with a single replication fork, where strand annealing can occur.\n-   $K_D$: The thermodynamic dissociation constant for the equilibrium between the Beta protein (or Beta-DnaN fusion) and an ssDNA oligo.\n-   $k_{ann}$: The intrinsic rate constant for the strand annealing reaction once a Beta-ssDNA complex is correctly positioned at the target site on the lagging strand.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1.  For simplicity, consider a cell with only one active replication fork.\n2.  The binding and unbinding of ssDNA oligos to Beta (or the Beta-DnaN fusion) is a very fast process that reaches a quasi-equilibrium state almost instantaneously compared to the much slower strand annealing event.\n3.  The cell is flooded with oligos, such that the total number of oligos is much greater than the number of Beta or Beta-DnaN proteins ($N_O \\gg N_B$ and $N_O \\gg N_{DN}$). Consequently, the concentration of free oligos is not significantly depleted by binding and can be considered constant.\n4.  In the traditional system, all molecules (Beta, oligos, and Beta-ssDNA complexes) are distributed uniformly throughout the cell volume $V_c$.\n5.  In the engineered system, all $N_{DN}$ Beta-DnaN fusion proteins are strictly localized within the replication fork volume $V_f$. The ssDNA oligos, however, remain uniformly distributed throughout the cell volume $V_c$.\n6.  The strand annealing reaction can only occur within the volume $V_f$.\n7.  The fusion of Beta to DnaN does not alter its affinity for ssDNA, so $K_D$ is the same for both systems. Similarly, the intrinsic annealing rate constant $k_{ann}$ is unchanged.", "solution": "The strand annealing event is assumed to be first order in the number of correctly positioned BetaâssDNA complexes within the reactive fork volume, with intrinsic rate constant $k_{ann}$.
