The center of this detection zone is located a distance $L$ upstream from the leading edge of a pair of sorting electrodes. The electrodes themselves have a length of $d_e$.

The detection occurs when the droplet's center is at the detection zone. The sorting is intended to happen when the droplet's center is at the longitudinal center of the sorting electrodes. The distance from the detection point to the beginning (leading edge) of the electrodes is $L$. The electrodes have a length $d_e$, so their center is located at a distance of $\\frac{d_e}{2}$ from the leading edge.
