This practice challenges you to think critically about experimental design by diagnosing a common issue in RT-qPCR. Understanding the role of the 'no reverse transcriptase' (-RT) control is crucial for distinguishing a true signal from RNA from a false positive caused by contaminating genomic DNA. [@problem_id:2064629]", "problem": "A student in a synthetic biology lab is tasked with quantifying the expression level of a specific gene, *syn-alpha*, in engineered yeast cells. The student isolates total Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) from the cell culture and sets up a Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) experiment. The standard protocol involves two main stages: first, using a reverse transcriptase enzyme to synthesize complementary Deoxyribonucleic Acid (cDNA) from the messenger RNA (mRNA) template; second, using qPCR to amplify and quantify the *syn-alpha* cDNA.\n\nTo ensure the validity of the results, the student includes a critical negative control: a \"no reverse transcriptase\" (-RT) reaction. This control tube contains the isolated RNA, primers specific for the *syn-alpha* gene, DNA polymerase, and all other necessary reagents for qPCR, but critically, the reverse transcriptase enzyme is omitted and replaced with water.\n\nUpon analyzing the results, the student observes a clear amplification signal for the *syn-alpha* gene in the -RT control tube, which should ideally show no amplification. Which of the following is the most probable explanation for this unexpected result?\n\nA. The initial RNA sample was contaminated with genomic Deoxyribonucleic Acid (gDNA) from the yeast cells.\n\nB. The primers used for amplifying *syn-alpha* are forming primer-dimers.\n\nC. The DNA polymerase used in the qPCR step has reverse transcriptase activity.\n\nD. Ribonuclease (RNase) contamination has degraded the RNA template in the -RT control tube.\n\nE. The water used to prepare the reaction mix was contaminated with foreign DNA from airborne bacteria.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most probable cause of an amplification signal in a \"no reverse transcriptase\" (-RT) negative control during an RT-qPCR experiment. Let's analyze the purpose of the experiment and the control to determine the source of the issue.\n\nThe overall goal of RT-qPCR is to measure the amount of a specific mRNA molecule, in this case, the *syn-alpha* mRNA. The process works by converting the target mRNA into a more stable DNA copy (cDNA) using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This cDNA then serves as the template for the qPCR amplification. The amount of amplified product is proportional to the initial amount of mRNA.\n\nA \"no reverse transcriptase\" (-RT) control is specifically designed to test for the presence of contaminating genomic DNA (gDNA) in the initial RNA sample. Eukaryotic genes, like those in yeast, often contain introns and exons. Even if the gene being studied is intron-less, the gDNA of the organism will contain the gene sequence. If the RNA purification step is not perfect, some gDNA can be carried over into the final RNA sample.\n\nIn the main reaction (with reverse transcriptase), the signal comes from the amplification of cDNA that was synthesized from the mRNA template. In the -RT control, there is no reverse transcriptase, so no cDNA can be synthesized from the mRNA template. Therefore, if a signal is detected, it must mean that a DNA template that is amplifiable by the *syn-alpha* primers was already present in the tube.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this understanding:\n\nA. The initial RNA sample was contaminated with genomic Deoxyribonucleic Acid (gDNA) from the yeast cells.\nIf the RNA sample is contaminated with yeast gDNA, the gDNA will contain the *syn-alpha* gene. The primers for *syn-alpha* will bind to this contaminating gDNA, and the DNA polymerase in the qPCR mix will amplify it, producing a signal. This amplification occurs independently of the reverse transcription step, which is absent in the -RT control. This perfectly explains the observed result and aligns with the primary purpose of this specific control.\n\nB. The primers used for amplifying *syn-alpha* are forming primer-dimers.\nPrimer-dimers are small DNA fragments formed when primers anneal to each other. They can be amplified and produce a signal. However, this is a general artifact of PCR and would be expected to occur in all reactions containing primers, not just the -RT control. While possible, it is not what the -RT control is specifically designed to identify, and a signal from gDNA contamination corresponding to the correct product size is a more direct interpretation of a failed -RT control. Therefore, gDNA contamination is a more probable explanation for a specific product signal.\n\nC. The DNA polymerase used in the qPCR step has reverse transcriptase activity.\nSome DNA polymerases can have weak reverse transcriptase activity, but this is uncommon for the standard enzymes used in qPCR (like Taq polymerase). Even if it did, this activity would lead to the creation of cDNA from the RNA template, meaning the -RT control would not be a true negative control for gDNA contamination. While a theoretical possibility in some contexts, it is far less common and probable than simple gDNA contamination from an imperfect RNA extraction.\n\nD. Ribonuclease (RNase) contamination has degraded the RNA template in the -RT control tube.\nRNases are enzymes that degrade RNA. If present, RNase contamination would destroy the RNA template. This would *prevent* any signal from being generated (if, for example, the polymerase had RT activity). It cannot *cause* a false positive signal. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nE. The water used to prepare the reaction mix was contaminated with foreign DNA from airborne bacteria.\nThis is a source of contamination, but it is highly improbable that an airborne bacterium would contain the specific *syn-alpha* gene sequence from the engineered yeast that the primers are designed to amplify. The primers are highly specific. Therefore, this is a very unlikely cause for the specific signal observed.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and probable explanation for an amplification signal in a reaction that lacks reverse transcriptase is the presence of a pre-existing DNA template that the primers can bind to. This corresponds to genomic DNA contamination in the original RNA sample.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2064629"}, {"introduction": "In synthetic biology, moving from qualitative detection to precise measurement is key to engineering predictable biological systems.

In the experiment, a fixed volume of total RNA extracted from the *E. coli* cells is mixed with a serially diluted amount of the competitor RNA.
