{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before beginning any work in the lab, a crucial first step in genome editing is to determine if the desired modification is even possible with the available tools. This exercise simulates this essential *in silico* design phase, focusing on the two most fundamental rules governing SpCas9-based base editors. You will practice applying the constraints of the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) and the editor's \"activity window\" to assess the feasibility of a proposed edit [@problem_id:2021034].", "problem": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpCas9) is a powerful tool for genome engineering. For therapeutic applications like base editing, a catalytically inactive or \"dead\" Cas9 (dCas9) is fused to a deaminase enzyme. This entire complex is guided to a specific DNA locus by a guide RNA (gRNA). For the SpCas9 system to bind to the DNA, the target site must contain a specific Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence. For SpCas9, the canonical PAM is 5'-NGG-3', where N can be any nucleotide. This PAM must be located on the DNA strand that is *not* bound by the gRNA (this strand is often called the non-target strand), immediately downstream (at the 3' end) of the 20-nucleotide sequence that is complementary to the gRNA's spacer region.\n\nAdenine Base Editors (ABEs), a class of base editors, utilize an engineered adenine deaminase enzyme to convert a target adenine (A) on the non-target strand to inosine (I). The cell's replication and repair machinery subsequently interprets inosine as guanine (G), resulting in a permanent $A \\cdot T$ to $G \\cdot C$ base pair conversion. This editing process is not perfectly precise and is constrained to a specific \"editing window\" along the protospacer. For a standard ABE constructed with SpCas9, this editing window typically spans positions 4 through 8. The positions are numbered 1 to 20 along the protospacer on the non-target strand, with position 1 being the furthest from the PAM and position 20 being the closest (i.e., immediately adjacent to the PAM).\n\nA scientist is attempting to correct a disease-causing mutation in a human cell line. The required correction is an A-to-G point mutation. The DNA sequence of the non-target strand surrounding the target adenine, [A], is as follows:\n5'- GTC AAG CTA CAT T[A]T GG CTT CGA -3'\n\nBased on the operational principles of the standard SpCas9-based ABE, which of the following statements correctly assesses the feasibility of performing the desired edit at this specific locus?\n\nA. It is feasible. A gRNA can be designed to use the 5'-TGG-3' sequence as a PAM, which would place the target [A] at a position that allows for efficient editing.\n\nB. It is not feasible. The required PAM sequence for SpCas9 is 5'-NGG-3', and no such sequence is present in the provided target locus.\n\nC. It is not feasible. The target adenine [A] is located at position 19 relative to the only available PAM (5'-TGG-3'), which is outside the canonical editing window of positions 4-8.\n\nD. It is feasible. Although the 5'-TGG-3' sequence places the target [A] outside the editing window, a different gRNA can be designed targeting a PAM further downstream, which would position [A] correctly.", "solution": "The solution requires a systematic analysis of the provided DNA sequence in the context of the rules governing SpCas9-based adenine base editors.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the components and constraints.**\n- **Target Edit**: A-to-G conversion on the non-target strand, which is the function of an Adenine Base Editor (ABE).\n- **Enzyme System**: Standard *S. pyogenes* Cas9 (SpCas9).\n- **PAM Requirement**: The system requires a 5'-NGG-3' PAM on the non-target strand, immediately 3' to the protospacer.\n- **Editing Window**: The target adenine must be within positions 4 to 8 of the protospacer for efficient editing.\n- **Position Convention**: Position 20 is closest to the PAM, and position 1 is furthest.\n- **Target Sequence (non-target strand)**: 5'- GTC AAG CTA CAT T[A]T GG CTT CGA -3'\n- **Target Base**: The adenine denoted by [A].\n\n**Step 2: Scan the target sequence for a valid PAM.**\nWe need to search the given sequence for any occurrences of the 5'-NGG-3' motif.\nThe sequence is: 5'- GTC AAG CTA CAT T[A]T GG CTT CGA -3'\n- Scanning from left to right, we find the sequence `TGG` starting two bases after the target [A].\n- The motif `TGG` matches the `NGG` pattern, with N=T.\n- Are there any other `NGG` motifs? `AAG` is not a match. `CGA` is not a match.\n- Therefore, the only potential PAM site within the provided sequence is `5'-TGG-3'`.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the position of the target base relative to the identified PAM.**\nThe problem states that the PAM must be immediately downstream (3') of the 20-nucleotide protospacer. The positions are numbered 1 (PAM-distal) to 20 (PAM-proximal). This means the nucleotide immediately 5' to the PAM is at position 20.\n\nLet's examine the sequence around the target [A] and the PAM `TGG`:\nSequence: `... T[A]T GG ...`\nThe PAM is `TGG`.\nThe nucleotide immediately 5' to this PAM is `T`. This `T` is at position 20 of the protospacer.\nThe nucleotide 5' to that `T` is our target base, `[A]`. This `[A]` is at position 19.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the target base's position with the editing window.**\nThe problem states the canonical editing window for this ABE is from position 4 to 8.\nOur target base `[A]` is at position 19.\nPosition 19 is well outside the 4-8 editing window. Therefore, the ABE would not be able to efficiently edit the target adenine.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the multiple-choice options.**\n\n*   **A. It is feasible. A gRNA can be designed to use the 5'-TGG-3' sequence as a PAM, which would place the target [A] at a position that allows for efficient editing.**\n    This is incorrect. While the `TGG` can be used as a PAM, it places the target `[A]` at position 19, which is *outside* the editing window, not in a position that allows for efficient editing.\n\n*   **B. It is not feasible. The required PAM sequence for SpCas9 is 5'-NGG-3', and no such sequence is present in the provided target locus.**\n    This is incorrect. The sequence `TGG` is present and matches the `5'-NGG-3'` requirement (with N=T).\n\n*   **C. It is not feasible. The target adenine [A] is located at position 19 relative to the only available PAM (5'-TGG-3'), which is outside the canonical editing window of positions 4-8.**\n    This statement is correct. It correctly identifies the only PAM in the sequence. It also correctly identifies that the target `[A]` falls at position 19 relative to this PAM. Finally, it correctly concludes that this position is outside the specified editing window (4-8), making the edit not feasible with a standard setup.\n\n*   **D. It is feasible. Although the 5'-TGG-3' sequence places the target [A] outside the editing window, a different gRNA can be designed targeting a PAM further downstream, which would position [A] correctly.**\n    This is incorrect. Based on the self-contained sequence provided in the problem (5'- GTC AAG CTA CAT T[A]T GG CTT CGA -3'), there are no other `NGG` PAMs downstream. We cannot assume the existence of a PAM in the `...` portion. The assessment must be based on the given information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only available PAM positions the target base outside the active editing window. Therefore, the proposed edit is not feasible with a standard SpCas9 ABE.
