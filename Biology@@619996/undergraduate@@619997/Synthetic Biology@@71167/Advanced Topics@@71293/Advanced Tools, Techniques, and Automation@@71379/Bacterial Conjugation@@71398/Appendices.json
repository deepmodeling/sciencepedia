This exercise [@problem_id:2019487] challenges you to design a selection strategy, a cornerstone technique in molecular biology.

The donor strain is an *E. coli* variant that carries a plasmid containing the synthetic circuit. This plasmid also carries a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin. The recipient strain is a different *E. coli* variant that has a mutation on its chromosome, making it resistant to the antibiotic streptomycin. The donor strain lacks this chromosomal mutation, and the recipient strain initially lacks the plasmid.\n\nThe researcher mixes the donor and recipient strains under conditions that allow for conjugation, the process by which a plasmid is transferred from a donor to a recipient cell. The goal is to isolate the resulting \"transconjugant\" cells, which are the recipient cells that have successfully received the plasmid. To achieve this, the mixture of cells is spread onto a solid growth medium (an agar plate) containing specific antibiotics.\n\nWhich of the following antibiotic selections on the agar plate should be used to ensure that only the transconjugant cells grow, while the original donor and recipient cells are eliminated?\n\nA.

A different antibiotic, such as ampicillin, to which neither parent strain is resistant.", "solution": "Conjugation transfers plasmid-borne genes from a donor to a recipient. Antibiotic selection on agar allows only cells with the corresponding resistance genes to grow; cells sensitive to an antibiotic on the plate are eliminated.\n\nAssign resistance phenotypes:\n- Donor strain carries the plasmid with kanamycin resistance and lacks the chromosomal streptomycin resistance, so donor is $Kan^{R} \\, Str^{S}$.\n- Recipient strain lacks the plasmid and carries chromosomal streptomycin resistance, so recipient is $Kan^{S} \\, Str^{R}$.\n- Transconjugant is a recipient that has acquired the plasmid via conjugation, so it becomes $Kan^{R} \\, Str^{R}$.\n\nEvaluate antibiotic selections:\n- Kanamycin only selects for $Kan^{R}$ cells; both donor ($Kan^{R} \\, Str^{S}$) and transconjugant ($Kan^{R} \\, Str^{R}$) would grow, so this does not exclude donors. Thus A is not correct.\n- Streptomycin only selects for $Str^{R}$ cells; both recipient ($Kan^{S} \\, Str^{R}$) and transconjugant ($Kan^{R} \\, Str^{R}$) would grow, so this does not exclude recipients. Thus B is not correct.\n- Kanamycin and streptomycin together select for cells that are simultaneously $Kan^{R}$ and $Str^{R}$; only the transconjugant ($Kan^{R} \\, Str^{R}$) satisfies both, while donor ($Kan^{R} \\, Str^{S}$) and recipient ($Kan^{S} \\, Str^{R}$) are each eliminated by one antibiotic. Thus C is correct.\n- No antibiotics allow all cells to grow, providing no selection. Thus D is not correct.\n- An unrelated antibiotic (e.g., ampicillin) to which neither strain is resistant would eliminate all cells, including any transconjugants lacking that resistance.

This problem [@problem_id:2019505] asks you to think like a synthetic biologist and design a minimal \"cargo\" plasmid that can be transferred without sending along the entire conjugation machinery. This requires understanding the crucial difference between cis-acting DNA sequences, like the origin of transfer ($oriT$), and trans-acting proteins, which can be supplied by a separate \"helper\" plasmid. This modular design principle is fundamental to creating safe and controllable genetic systems.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is developing a system for controlled horizontal gene transfer in *Escherichia coli*. The goal is to transfer a gene of interest from a \"donor\" strain to a \"recipient\" strain without transferring the entire conjugation machinery, which would be metabolically costly and could lead to uncontrolled plasmid spread.\n\nThe system is designed as follows:\n1.  The donor *E. coli* strain is equipped with a \"helper\" plasmid. This helper plasmid contains the complete `tra` operon necessary for producing the conjugation pilus and all the protein machinery for Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) processing and transfer. However, this helper plasmid lacks its own origin of transfer (`oriT`), making it non-mobilizable.\n2.  The biologist intends to introduce a second, much smaller \"cargo\" plasmid into this same donor strain. This cargo plasmid is designed to carry the gene of interest. The plan is for the machinery produced by the helper plasmid to act on this cargo plasmid, mobilizing it into a recipient cell during conjugation.\n\nTo ensure the system works as intended, the cargo plasmid must be able to replicate within the donor strain after transformation, allow for selection of donor cells that have successfully acquired it, and be recognized by the transfer machinery provided by the helper plasmid. What combination of genetic elements represents the absolute minimal set required on this cargo plasmid to fulfill these three functions?\n\nA. The `tra` operon and an origin of transfer (`oriT`).\n\nB. An origin of replication (`oriV`), an antibiotic resistance gene, and the `tra` operon.\n\nC. An origin of transfer (`oriT`), an origin of replication (`oriV`), and an antibiotic resistance gene.\n\nD. An origin of replication (`oriV`) and an antibiotic resistance gene.\n\nE. The `tra` operon, an origin of transfer (`oriT`), an origin of replication (`oriV`), and an antibiotic resistance gene.", "solution": "We identify the three required functions for the cargo plasmid and map each to the minimal genetic element needed.\n\n1) Replication in the donor strain: To persist after transformation, the plasmid must autonomously replicate in the donor. This requires a vegetative origin of replication, denoted as an origin of replication ($oriV$). Without $oriV$, the plasmid cannot be maintained, so any option lacking $oriV$ fails the replication requirement.\n\n2) Selection of donor cells that acquired the cargo: To select for cells that have successfully taken up the cargo plasmid, a selectable marker is required, typically an antibiotic resistance gene. Without such a marker, donors with the cargo cannot be selected.\n\n3) Recognition and mobilization by the helper-encoded transfer machinery: Conjugative transfer initiates at a cis-acting origin of transfer ($oriT$), where the relaxase (encoded within the $tra$ operon on the helper plasmid) nicks the DNA and initiates transfer. The $tra$ operon supplies the trans-acting proteins; the cargo plasmid only needs the cis-acting $oriT$ to be a substrate for the transfer machinery. Including the $tra$ operon on the cargo is unnecessary and contrary to the design goal of avoiding metabolic burden and uncontrolled spread.\n\nEvaluate the options against these minimal requirements:\n- A (tra + oriT): Lacks $oriV$ and a selectable marker; cannot replicate or be selected.\n- B (oriV + antibiotic + tra): Lacks $oriT$; cannot be mobilized by the helper machinery.\n- C (oriT + oriV + antibiotic): Provides replication ($oriV$), selection (antibiotic resistance), and mobilization (cis-acting $oriT$), satisfying all three with minimal content.\n- D (oriV + antibiotic): Lacks $oriT$; cannot be mobilized.\n- E (tra + oriT + oriV + antibiotic): Contains unnecessary $tra$ genes; not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the absolute minimal set on the cargo plasmid is $oriT$, $oriV$, and an antibiotic resistance gene, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2019505"}, {"introduction": "In the real world, biological processes are not perfectly efficient. Simple antibiotic selection may not be enough to eliminate all unwanted background cells. This practice [@problem_id:2019483] introduces a more advanced technique, counter-selection, which actively eliminates the original donor cells to improve the purity of your transconjugants. This problem elevates our thinking from a qualitative \"it works\" to a quantitative \"how well does it work?\", prompting you to derive a mathematical expression for the purity of the final cell population while accounting for factors like mutation rates and plasmid instability.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a research team aims to transfer a plasmid, pSynth1, from a donor strain of *Escherichia coli* to a recipient strain via conjugation. To efficiently isolate the resulting transconjugants, the team employs a counter-selection strategy.\n\nThe donor strain carries the pSynth1 plasmid, which confers Kanamycin resistance (KanR). Additionally, the donor's chromosome has been engineered to contain the *sacB* gene, which makes the cell sensitive to sucrose. The recipient strain is sensitive to Kanamycin (KanS) and does not possess the *sacB* gene.\n\nThe conjugation experiment is initiated by mixing a population of $N_D$ donor cells with $N_R$ recipient cells. After a period of incubation to allow for plasmid transfer, the entire cell mixture is plated onto agar plates containing both kanamycin and a high concentration of sucrose. This selective medium is designed to allow only the desired transconjugant cells to grow.\n\nHowever, the selection is not perfect. The key factors affecting the outcome are:\n1.  The conjugation frequency, $C_f$, is defined as the fraction of the initial recipient population that successfully receives the plasmid and becomes a transconjugant.\n2.  The plasmid is not perfectly stable within the donor population. A fraction, $p_l$, of donor cells spontaneously lose the plasmid before the plating step.\n3.  The counter-selection is imperfect. A small fraction, $p_s$, of the *sacB*-containing donor cells acquire spontaneous loss-of-function mutations in the *sacB* gene, rendering them resistant to sucrose.\n\nAssume that a cell must be both KanR and sucrose-resistant to form a colony on the selective plates. Derive an expression for the purity of the colonies on the selective plate, where purity is defined as the ratio of the number of true transconjugant colonies to the total number of all colonies that appear. Your final expression should be in terms of $N_D$, $N_R$, $C_f$, $p_l$, and $p_s$.", "solution": "We enumerate all cell types that can form colonies on plates containing kanamycin and sucrose, using the condition that a colony must be both KanR and sucrose-resistant.\n\n1. True transconjugants arise from recipients that receive the plasmid. By definition of conjugation frequency, the number of true transconjugants is\n$$\nN_{T} = C_{f} N_{R},\n$$\nsince recipients lack the sacB gene and thus are intrinsically sucrose-resistant; acquiring the KanR plasmid makes them KanR, so they grow.\n\n2. Donor escapees can only grow if they are both KanR and sucrose-resistant. Donors are KanR provided they retain the plasmid, which occurs with probability $(1 - p_{l})$. Donors become sucrose-resistant only if they acquire a loss-of-function in sacB, which occurs in a fraction $p_{s}$ of donor cells. Assuming these events are independent within the donor population prior to plating, the expected number of donor escapee colonies is\n$$\nN_{E} = N_{D} (1 - p_{l}) p_{s}.\n$$\n\n3. No other categories can grow: donors that lose the plasmid are KanS and cannot grow on kanamycin; donors without sacB mutations remain sucrose-sensitive; recipients that do not receive the plasmid remain KanS and cannot grow.\n\nTherefore, the total colony count on the selective plates is\n$$\nN_{\\text{tot}} = N_{T} + N_{E} = C_{f} N_{R} + (1 - p_{l}) p_{s} N_{D}.\n$$\n\nThe purity, defined as the fraction of colonies that are true transconjugants, is then\n$$\n\\text{Purity} = \\frac{N_{T}}{N_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{C_{f} N_{R}}{C_{f} N_{R} + (1 - p_{l}) p_{s} N_{D}}.\n$$\nThis expression is in terms of $N_{D}$, $N_{R}$, $C_{f}$, $p_{l}$, and $p_{s}$ as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{C_{f} N_{R}}{C_{f} N_{R} + (1 - p_{l}) p_{s} N_{D}}}$$", "id": "2019483"}]}
