The starting point is a wild-type protein consisting of a single chain of 100 amino acids.

A point mutation is defined as changing the amino acid at a single position to any of the other standard amino acids.

The synthesis of this protein in a bacterial culture is induced by a specific chemical, and the final protein yield, $Y$, is known to follow a saturation model as a function of the inducer's concentration, $[I]$. This relationship is described by the equation:\n$$Y([I]) = \\frac{Y_{\\text{max}} [I]}{K + [I]}$$\nwhere $Y_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum possible protein yield and $K$ is the saturation constant, representing the inducer concentration at which the yield is half of its maximum.\n\nThe inducer is expensive, and its cost is directly proportional to the concentration used. To balance the benefit of high yield against the cost of the inducer, the AI uses a utility function, $U([I])$, which it aims to maximize:\n$$U([I]) = Y([I]) - \\lambda [I]$$\nHere, $\\lambda$ is a positive constant that represents the marginal cost of the inducer, normalized into the same units as the yield.

The high number of G-C base pairs, each formed by three hydrogen bonds, results in an extremely high melting temperature ($T_m$) and a strong tendency to form stable secondary structures, inhibiting the strand separation and polymerase processivity essential for synthesis and amplification.\n\nB. Guanine and cytosine are purines and pyrimidines, respectively, that are significantly larger than adenine and thymine. The high density of these bases creates severe steric hindrance, physically preventing the DNA polymerase from binding to the DNA template.\n\nC. The repetitive GC-rich pattern is incorrectly recognized by DNA polymerase as a replication termination signal, analogous to a transcriptional terminator, causing the enzyme to dissociate from the template strand prematurely.\n\nD. The genetic code is degenerate, and a sequence with such an extreme G-C bias would produce an mRNA transcript that stalls ribosomes during translation due to the scarcity of corresponding charged tRNA molecules in the cell, making the entire construct functionally useless.\n\nE. Standard DNA synthesis and amplification reactions maintain a balanced concentration of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). A sequence this biased would rapidly deplete the dGTP and dCTP pools, causing the reaction to halt due to substrate starvation.", "solution": "1) Parse the proposed sequence and its composition. The 40-mer given is comprised solely of guanine and cytosine with long guanine tracts; explicitly, there are $40$ positions with $32$ G and $8$ C, i.e., a GC content of $1$ (one hundred percent) and repeated $G_{n}$ runs. Such sequences are known to be exceptionally stable in duplex form and, even as single strands, to form highly stable secondary structures.\n\n2) Connect GC content to thermal stability and melting temperature. Duplex stability is governed by hydrogen bonding and base stacking. Each G-C base pair has three hydrogen bonds, whereas A-T has two. In nearest-neighbor thermodynamics, the free energy of duplex formation satisfies $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$, with G-C rich nearest neighbors yielding more negative $\\Delta G$ (i.e., greater stability) than A-T rich ones. The melting temperature satisfies an expression of the form\n$$\nT_{m} = \\frac{\\Delta H}{\\Delta S + R \\ln(C)} \\, ,\n$$\nso larger-magnitude enthalpic stabilization $\\Delta H$ from G-C pairs and strong G-G stacking raises $T_{m}$. Therefore, a GC-saturated sequence has an extremely high $T_{m}$, making strand separation (required for both chemical handling of single strands and for PCR denaturation) difficult under standard conditions.\n\n3) Identify secondary structures intrinsic to G-rich repeats. Long runs of G promote intramolecular secondary structures, notably:\n- Hairpins with G-C stems exhibiting very negative $\\Delta G$.\n- G-quadruplexes formed via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding among guanines, which are further stabilized by monovalent cations, yielding structures with $\\Delta G$ sufficiently negative to persist at temperatures where standard PCR or synthesis handling would aim to denature the strand.\n\nThese structures impede polymerase progression because polymerases require a single-stranded, unstructured template region for efficient incorporation and display reduced processivity or stalling when encountering stable secondary structures.\n\n4) Consequences for synthesis and PCR amplification. \n- In solid-phase chemical DNA synthesis, extreme G-richness and propensity to fold can cause intra-strand structures even during synthesis and purification, increasing truncations and synthesis errors and reducing final yield. \n- In PCR, the exceptionally high $T_{m}$ and stable secondary structures prevent efficient denaturation and reannealing control, cause primer misannealing or failure to anneal, and stall or dislodge DNA polymerases, all of which undermine amplification.\n\n5) Evaluate the options against these principles.\n- A correctly cites the fundamental biochemical reasons: three hydrogen bonds in G-C pairs and strong stacking increase $T_{m}$, and G-rich repeats form stable secondary structures that inhibit strand separation and polymerase processivity, directly explaining the synthesis and PCR difficulties.\n- B is incorrect: while G is a purine and C a pyrimidine, A is also a purine and T a pyrimidine; purine-pyrimidine pairing maintains uniform helix geometry, so there is no special steric hindrance specific to G-C that blocks polymerase binding.\n- C is incorrect: DNA replication polymerases do not interpret GC-rich repeats as terminators; replication termination signals (e.g., Tus/Ter in bacteria) are specific and unrelated to generic GC repeats.\n- D is incorrect and irrelevant to the stated synthesis/PCR issue; additionally, a promoter is not translated, and codon degeneracy pertains to coding sequences, not promoter function or in vitro synthesis/amplification feasibility.\n- E is not a fundamental barrier: PCR and synthesis reactions use externally supplied dNTPs at controlled concentrations; sequence bias does not intrinsically deplete dGTP/dCTP pools to halt reactions, and reagents can be adjusted.\n\nTherefore, A provides the most accurate and fundamental biochemical reason for rejecting the computationally proposed sequence for standard synthesis and PCR amplification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2018081"}]}
