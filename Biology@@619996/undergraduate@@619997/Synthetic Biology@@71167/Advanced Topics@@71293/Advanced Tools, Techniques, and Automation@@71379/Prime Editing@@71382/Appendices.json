The system comprises a prime editor protein complex and a custom-designed prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). The pegRNA includes a crucial sequence known as the Reverse Transcriptase Template (RTT), which the editor protein uses to synthesize the corrected DNA strand.\n\nIn an initial, highly optimized experiment, the team uses a standard pegRNA concentration and achieves a gene editing efficiency of 75.0%. Under these experimental conditions, the editing efficiency is directly proportional to the concentration of pegRNA molecules whose RTT domain is structurally accessible to the prime editor's reverse transcriptase enzyme.\n\nSubsequently, a new batch of the same pegRNA is synthesized. An error during synthesis introduces a single-nucleotide change within the RTT sequence. This change does not affect the genetic information encoded for the final edit, but it inadvertently creates a self-complementary region, causing the RTT to fold into a stable intramolecular hairpin structure. This hairpin formation renders the RTT inaccessible to the enzyme.\n\nThe system is maintained at a physiological temperature of 37.0 °C. The Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G$) associated with the formation of this hairpin from the unfolded, accessible state is determined to be -6.25 kJ/mol.\n\nAssuming the population of new pegRNA molecules reaches thermal equilibrium between the unfolded (accessible) and hairpin (inaccessible) conformations, calculate the predicted new gene editing efficiency.\n\nUse the universal gas constant $R = 8.314$ J⋅mol⁻¹⋅K⁻¹.\n\nExpress your final answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the two conformations be unfolded, accessible ($U$) and hairpin, inaccessible ($H$), with the folding reaction $U \\to H$.

The disease is caused by a single point mutation in the beta-globin (HBB) gene. In the context of this experiment, we can simplify the genetics to a single nucleotide position. The wild-type (healthy) allele contains an adenine (A) at this position, while the sickle-cell (disease) allele contains a thymine (T).\n\nThe researchers started with a cell line that was homozygous for the disease allele (genotype T/T). After applying the prime editor designed to convert the T back to an A, they isolated a single cell and grew it into a large, clonal population. To verify the outcome of the edit in this clone, they performed the following procedure:\n1.  Genomic DNA was extracted from the clonal cell population.\n2.  The region of the HBB gene containing the target nucleotide was amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).\n3.  The resulting PCR product was analyzed by Sanger sequencing.\n\nIn Sanger sequencing analysis, the relative abundance of each nucleotide at a specific position in the DNA sample is reflected in the height of its corresponding fluorescent peak in the chromatogram. For a homozygous position (e.g., A/A or T/T), a single, full-height peak is observed, which is calibrated to a reference height of 100 arbitrary units. At the target nucleotide position in their sample, the researchers observed a peak for adenine (A) with a height of 48 units and a peak for thymine (T) with a height of 51 units.\n\nBased on this sequencing data, what is the genotype of the cells in the clonal population at the target locus?\n\nA.

Homozygous for the uncorrected disease allele (T/T)\n\nD. The population is a mosaic, containing a mixture of A/A, A/T, and T/T cells.\n\nE. The prime editing experiment failed and caused a large deletion at the target site.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the genotype of a clonal cell population after a prime editing experiment, using Sanger sequencing data.\n\nFirst, let's understand the experimental setup and the possible outcomes. The starting cell line is homozygous for the disease allele, which we denote as T/T. The prime editor is designed to change the T allele to the wild-type A allele. The experiment involves isolating a single cell after the editing process and expanding it into a clonal population. This means every cell in the final population has the exact same genotype as that original, single, post-editing cell.\n\nThere are three possible genotypes for this founding cell at the target locus:\n1.  **Homozygous corrected (A/A):** The prime editor successfully converted the T to an A on both homologous chromosomes.\n2.  **Heterozygous (A/T):** The prime editor successfully converted the T to an A on only one of the two homologous chromosomes.\n3.  **Homozygous uncorrected (T/T):** The prime editor failed to convert the T on either chromosome.\n\nNext, we need to predict the Sanger sequencing result for each of these three possible genotypes. The DNA from the clonal population is amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This process creates many copies of the target DNA region from the cells' genomes. The pool of PCR products is then sequenced.\n\nThe problem states that the height of a sequencing peak is proportional to the nucleotide's prevalence in the sample, with a homozygous base pair giving a peak height of approximately 100 units.\n\n-   **If the genotype is A/A (homozygous corrected):** All the amplified DNA will have an 'A' at the target position. The Sanger sequencing result should show a strong 'A' peak with a height of approximately 100 units, and a negligible 'T' peak (close to 0 units).\n\n-   **If the genotype is T/T (homozygous uncorrected):** All the amplified DNA will have a 'T' at the target position. The sequencing result should show a strong 'T' peak with a height of approximately 100 units, and a negligible 'A' peak.\n\n-   **If the genotype is A/T (heterozygous):** The cell's genome contains one 'A' allele and one 'T' allele. PCR will amplify both alleles. The resulting pool of PCR products will be an approximately 50/50 mixture of DNA containing 'A' and DNA containing 'T' at the target position. Therefore, the Sanger sequencing should detect both bases. The 'A' peak height would be approximately $0.5 \\times 100 = 50$ units, and the 'T' peak height would also be approximately $0.5 \\times 100 = 50$ units.\n\nNow, let's compare these predictions with the experimental data provided:\n-   Observed 'A' peak height = 48 units.\n-   Observed 'T' peak height = 51 units.\n\nThese observed values (48 and 51) are very close to the 50/50 split predicted for a heterozygous genotype. The total signal (48 + 51 = 99 units) is also consistent with the calibrated full height of 100 units.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the given options:\n-   A. Homozygous for the corrected wild-type allele (A/A): This is inconsistent with the data, as it would produce an 'A' peak of ~100 and a 'T' peak of ~0.\n-   B. Heterozygous, with one corrected wild-type allele and one uncorrected disease allele (A/T): This is highly consistent with the data, which shows two peaks of approximately half-height.\n-   C. Homozygous for the uncorrected disease allele (T/T): This is inconsistent with the data, as it would produce a 'T' peak of ~100 and an 'A' peak of ~0.\n-   D. The population is a mosaic: This is incorrect. The problem specifies that the population is clonal, meaning it originated from a single cell. All cells are genetically identical. A mosaic population would yield similar sequencing data, but it contradicts the stated experimental design. The data perfectly fits the simpler explanation of a uniformly heterozygous clonal population.\n-   E. The prime editing experiment failed and caused a large deletion: This is inconsistent with the data. A deletion would cause a frameshift in the sequencing read, leading to noisy and uninterpretable signal downstream of the deletion site. The presence of two clear, quantifiable peaks at the target position indicates that the sequence integrity is maintained at that locus.\n\nTherefore, the sequencing data indicates that the clonal population is heterozygous (A/T).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2056300"}, {"introduction": "While verifying edits in single clones is essential, a full assessment of a prime editing experiment requires analyzing the entire, heterogeneous population of edited cells.

The PE3 system utilizes a prime editor protein guided by a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) to nick the target DNA strand and reverse transcribe the desired edit. Crucially, the PE3 strategy also employs a second, standard single-guide RNA (sgRNA) to introduce another nick on the opposite, unedited strand nearby. This second nick is intended to bias the cell's repair machinery towards incorporating the edit. However, incorrect repair of this second nick can lead to unwanted insertions or deletions (indels).\n\nAfter the experiment, the researchers perform targeted deep sequencing, a form of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), on the edited cell population to assess the outcomes at the target locus.
