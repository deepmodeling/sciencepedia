{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A cornerstone of synthetic biology is the precise construction of genetic systems. Before testing the function of a newly engineered organism, we must first confirm that the genetic modifications have been integrated correctly. This exercise introduces a fundamental and widely used technique for this purpose: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). By designing specific primers that flank or span the intended integration site, you can develop a robust assay to verify the presence and exact location of a synthetic element, such as a `loxPsym` site, within the vastness of a chromosome. Mastering this type of diagnostic thinking is an essential skill for troubleshooting and validating any genetic engineering project [@problem_id:2066998].", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team is working on the SCRaMbLE (Synthetic Chromosome Rearrangement and Modification by LoxP-mediated Evolution) system in yeast. A key step is the targeted integration of a 34 base pair (bp) `loxPsym` site into a synthetic chromosome. The team aims to insert a single `loxPsym` site immediately after the stop codon of a gene named `SYN1`, which has a coding sequence of 900 bp. In the original, unmodified chromosome, the `SYN1` stop codon is followed by a 250 bp downstream non-coding region.\n\nTo verify the success of the integration, the team designs four different oligonucleotide primers for use in a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay:\n- **Primer F1**: A forward primer that anneals to the coding strand of the `SYN1` gene, with its 3' end located 100 bp upstream of the `SYN1` stop codon.\n- **Primer R1**: A reverse primer that anneals to the template strand in the downstream non-coding region, with its 3' end located 150 bp downstream from the original position of the `SYN1` stop codon.\n- **Primer F2**: A forward primer that anneals to the coding strand within the 34 bp `loxPsym` sequence.\n- **Primer R2**: A reverse primer that anneals to the template strand within the 34 bp `loxPsym` sequence.\n\nThe team considers four different PCR strategies to test colonies of yeast after the transformation procedure. Which of the following strategies provides the most specific and unambiguous evidence that the `loxPsym` site has been correctly integrated at its intended location immediately after the `SYN1` gene?\n\nA. A PCR reaction with primers F1 and R1. The presence of a PCR product approximately 34 bp larger than the product from an unmodified yeast control is considered confirmation.\n\nB. A PCR reaction with primers F2 and R2. The presence of a PCR product of approximately 34 bp is considered confirmation.\n\nC. A PCR reaction with primers F1 and R2. The presence of a PCR product of a specific, predictable size is considered confirmation.\n\nD. A PCR reaction using two primers that both anneal within the `SYN1` gene. The presence of a PCR product is considered confirmation.", "solution": "We use the principle of end-point PCR: a product is generated only when two primers anneal on the same DNA molecule in opposite orientations with their 3' ends pointing toward each other and are separated by a contiguous template segment. The amplified product length equals the distance from the 3' end of the forward primer to the 3' end of the reverse primer along the template.\n\nDefine symbols for distances given in the problem:\n- Let $u$ denote the distance from the 3' end of Primer F1 to the stop codon of SYN1, with $u=100\\,\\text{bp}$.\n- Let $d$ denote the distance from the stop codon to the 3' end of Primer R1 in the downstream region, with $d=150\\,\\text{bp}$.\n- Let $s$ denote the length of the loxPsym site, with $s=34\\,\\text{bp}$.\n\nEvaluate each strategy:\n\nA. Primers F1 and R1 flank the SYN1 stop region. In the unmodified chromosome, the F1–R1 amplicon length is\n$$\nL_{\\text{unmod}}=u+d.\n$$\nAfter correct integration of a single loxPsym immediately after the stop codon, the F1–R1 amplicon length becomes\n$$\nL_{\\text{mod}}=u+s+d,\n$$\nso the size shift is\n$$\n\\Delta L=L_{\\text{mod}}-L_{\\text{unmod}}=s.\n$$\nWhile a shift of $s$ suggests insertion of an element of the expected size at the intended locus, this does not unambiguously prove identity of the insert (it could be a different sequence of length $s$) nor confirm the precise junction sequence or orientation. Thus, it is supportive but not the most specific or unambiguous.\n\nB. Primers F2 and R2 both lie within the loxPsym sequence. The expected amplicon length is the internal distance between their 3' ends (at most $s$ and fixed by primer design). However, this product can arise from any loxPsym present anywhere in the genome or from residual donor DNA, and therefore does not demonstrate locus-specific integration. Hence, it lacks specificity for the intended location.\n\nC. Primers F1 and R2 constitute a junction PCR: F1 is in SYN1 upstream of the stop codon and R2 is within loxPsym. A product will be generated only if loxPsym is integrated immediately downstream of SYN1 in the correct orientation such that R2 faces toward F1 across the SYN1–loxPsym junction. The expected amplicon length is\n$$\nL_{\\text{F1–R2}}=u+\\delta,\n$$\nwhere $\\delta$ is the distance from the SYN1–loxPsym junction to the 3' end of R2 within the loxPsym sequence, determined by primer design. Absence of the loxPsym at the intended locus (or incorrect orientation) yields no product, and presence elsewhere cannot yield a product because F1 is locus-specific. This provides specific and unambiguous evidence of correct insertion at the intended site.\n\nD. Two primers within SYN1 only demonstrate the presence of the gene region and do not report on the presence or position of the loxPsym insertion. This cannot confirm correct integration.\n\nTherefore, the junction PCR in option C is the most specific and unambiguous test among the choices, as it directly assays the correct SYN1–loxPsym junction at the intended locus and orientation with a predictable product size defined by primer positions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2066998"}, {"introduction": "The SCRaMbLE system is a powerful tool for generating immense genetic diversity, but how do we find the one-in-a-million cell with the exact modification we want? Screening each colony individually is often impractical. This practice explores a far more elegant and efficient approach: genetic selection. You will design an experiment using a counter-selectable marker, the URA3 gene, to specifically isolate yeast cells that have undergone a desired deletion event. This problem highlights the importance of clever experimental design, where biological logic is used to make rare desired outcomes the only ones that can survive, turning a painstaking search into a straightforward selection [@problem_id:2067028].", "problem": "In synthetic biology, the SCRaMbLE system (Synthetic Chromosome Rearrangement and Modification by LoxP-mediated Evolution) is a powerful tool used in designer yeast chromosomes of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. When activated, it induces random genomic rearrangements, including deletions, between strategically placed `loxPsym` sites. A common method for selecting desired genetic outcomes is to use a counter-selectable marker like the *URA3* gene. The URA3 protein product is essential for growth on media lacking uracil, but it also converts the non-toxic pro-drug 5-Fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) into a toxic substance, killing the cell.\n\nA synthetic biologist has designed a linear synthetic chromosome containing two large, non-essential genomic regions, termed \"Region A\" and \"Region B\". The entire chromosome is populated with `loxPsym` sites, making both Region A and Region B susceptible to deletion via SCRaMbLE. The biologist's goal is to devise an experiment to specifically isolate yeast cells that have deleted Region A, while leaving Region B intact.\n\nWhich of the following experimental strategies most directly selects for the desired yeast variants (i.e., those with Region A deleted and Region B present)?\n\nA. Integrate the *URA3* gene within Region A. After inducing SCRaMbLE, plate the cell library on growth media lacking uracil but containing 5-FOA.\n\nB. Integrate the *URA3* gene within Region B.

Deletion of Region A makes cells URA3-negative. Plating on media lacking uracil plus 5-FOA simultaneously requires URA3 for growth and kills URA3-positive cells. Both URA3-positive and URA3-negative cells fail to grow, so this does not select the desired class.\n- Option B places URA3 in Region B and plates on uracil plus 5-FOA, selecting URA3-negative cells, i.e., those that deleted Region B. This selects against the desired retention of Region B.\n- Option C places URA3 in Region A and plates on uracil plus 5-FOA, selecting URA3-negative cells, which directly correspond to those that deleted Region A. This selection is neutral with respect to Region B; among the provided options, it most directly enriches for the desired Region A deletions.\n- Option D places URA3 in Region B and plates without uracil, selecting URA3-positive cells (Region B present), but it does not select for deletion of Region A, so it does not isolate the desired combination.\n\nTherefore, the strategy that most directly selects for Region A deletions (while not deselecting Region B) is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2067028"}, {"introduction": "True engineering disciplines rely not only on building and testing but also on predictive modeling. This exercise elevates our approach to the SCRaMbLE system from a purely experimental tool to a predictable, tunable genetic circuit. We explore a self-limiting design where the Cre recombinase not only drives genomic rearrangements but also catalyzes its own gene's deletion, creating a negative feedback loop. By describing this system with a mathematical model, we can understand how molecular parameters—such as protein production rate $\\alpha$, degradation rate $\\delta$, and excision rate $k_{ex}$—collectively determine the total duration and intensity of SCRaMbLE activity. This practice demonstrates how quantitative analysis enables the design of sophisticated dynamic behaviors in living cells [@problem_id:2067041].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a strain of yeast is engineered with a self-limiting genetic circuit to control the activity of the Synthetic Chromosome Rearrangement and Modification by LoxP-mediated Evolution (SCRaMbLE) system. The circuit is designed as follows:\n\nThe expression of Cre recombinase is driven by an inducible promoter, which is activated at time $t=0$. The Cre recombinase protein then performs two functions: it activates the SCRaMbLE system, causing genomic rearrangements, and it also recognizes loxP sites flanking its own gene, catalyzing the gene's excision from the chromosome. This self-excision acts as a negative feedback loop, eventually shutting down Cre production.\n\nLet $C(t)$ be the intracellular concentration of active Cre recombinase, and let $G(t)$ be the fraction of the cell population that still possesses an intact Cre gene.
