{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Engineering a non-model organism often begins with a fundamental challenge: getting your desired genetic circuit into the new host. Since most genetic constructs are built and tested in a standard lab strain like *E. coli*, we need a specialized tool—a shuttle vector—that can operate in both the engineering host and the final target organism. This exercise challenges you to think like a plasmid designer, identifying the essential genetic parts required for a plasmid to replicate and be selected for in two very different bacterial worlds, a crucial first step in any cross-species engineering project [@problem_id:2035489].", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is developing a strategy to produce a valuable industrial enzyme in a newly isolated, non-model *Bacillus* species, which is a Gram-positive bacterium. Their plan involves first constructing and verifying a plasmid in a standard laboratory strain of *Escherichia coli* (a Gram-negative bacterium) before transferring the final construct into the *Bacillus* host for protein expression. To achieve this, they need to design a shuttle vector—a plasmid capable of being propagated in both host organisms.\n\nWhich of the following choices describes the minimal set of core genetic components required to create a functional shuttle vector *backbone* that can be propagated and selected for in both *E. coli* and the non-model *Bacillus* species?\n\nA. A single broad-host-range origin of replication, a selectable marker gene effective in *E. coli*, and a Multiple Cloning Site (MCS).\n\nB. An origin of replication for *E. coli*, a selectable marker gene effective in *Bacillus*, and a Multiple Cloning Site (MCS).\n\nC. An origin of replication for *E. coli*, an origin of replication for *Bacillus*, a single selectable marker gene effective in both hosts, and a Multiple Cloning Site (MCS).\n\nD. An origin of replication for *E. coli*, an origin of replication for *Bacillus*, two separate selectable marker genes (one for each host), a Multiple Cloning Site (MCS), and a pre-inserted gene of interest.\n\nE. An origin of replication for *E. coli*, an origin of replication for *Bacillus*, and a selectable marker gene effective in *E. coli*.", "solution": "We identify the core requirements for a plasmid to function as a shuttle vector between two phylogenetically and physiologically distinct hosts (a Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli, and a Gram-positive Bacillus species).\n\n1) Replication in both hosts requires host-compatible replication functions. The physical principle is that plasmid maintenance depends on a host-recognized origin of replication and associated replication control elements. Because Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria typically use different replication machineries and control systems, a single origin rarely supports replication across both groups. Therefore, to ensure propagation in both hosts, the minimal requirement is two origins: one origin of replication compatible with E. coli and one origin of replication compatible with Bacillus.\n\n2) Selection in both hosts requires selectable phenotype expression in each host. Selection is typically implemented by an antibiotic resistance gene or similar selectable marker expressed from a promoter that functions in the given host. To meet the stated requirement “propagated and selected for in both E. coli and the non-model Bacillus,” the minimal condition is that there is at least one selectable marker that confers selectable phenotype in both hosts. While many practical shuttle vectors include two separate selectable markers (one per host) to guarantee robust selection, this is not strictly minimal if a single marker is effective in both hosts (for example, a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene under a promoter active in both). Hence, the minimal set requires a selectable marker that functions in both hosts.\n\n3) Cloning capacity requires a Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) to insert and verify constructs while building the vector in E. coli before transfer to Bacillus. The MCS is part of the minimal backbone features for practical cloning workflows.\n\n4) A pre-inserted gene of interest is not part of the minimal backbone; the backbone is defined as the vector framework onto which cargo is cloned. Therefore, inclusion of a gene of interest is not required for a functional shuttle vector backbone.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A: A single broad-host-range origin plus an E. coli-only marker and MCS is insufficient because it lacks guaranteed replication in Bacillus and lacks Bacillus selection.\n- B: An E. coli origin, a Bacillus-only marker, and an MCS is insufficient because it lacks a Bacillus origin and lacks E. coli selection.\n- C: Two origins (one for E. coli, one for Bacillus), a single selectable marker effective in both hosts, and an MCS satisfies replication and selection in both and provides cloning capacity. This matches the minimal backbone.\n- D: Two origins, two separate markers (one per host), an MCS, and a pre-inserted gene of interest exceeds the minimal set; the gene of interest is not required for the backbone, and two markers are not strictly necessary if one works in both.\n- E: Two origins and an E. coli-only marker lacks selection in Bacillus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set that ensures propagation and selection in both hosts, and provides cloning capacity without unnecessary additions, is described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2035489"}, {"introduction": "While plasmids are excellent for prototyping, stable and long-term industrial applications often require permanent modification of the host's chromosome. A key goal is to make these edits \"markerless,\" meaning no foreign DNA like antibiotic resistance genes are left behind. This practice explores a clever and widely used strategy for markerless gene deletion that employs two-step selection, including a powerful technique called counter-selection [@problem_id:2035517]. Understanding this logic is key to designing sophisticated genome editing workflows for any organism.", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is working to engineer a novel, gram-negative soil bacterium, *Azotobacter ficticius*, for enhanced nitrogen fixation. Their goal is to create a \"markerless\" deletion of a regulatory gene, *nifL*, which is a known repressor of nitrogen fixation genes. To achieve this, they construct a suicide delivery plasmid that cannot replicate in *A. ficticius*. This plasmid contains the following key components:\n1.  Homology arms upstream and downstream of the *nifL* gene, but not the *nifL* gene itself.\n2.  A kanamycin resistance gene, *kanR*.\n3.  The *sacB* gene, which originates from *Bacillus subtilis*. The protein product of *sacB*, levansucrase, catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose into products that are toxic to many gram-negative bacteria, including *A. ficticius*.\n\nThe editing procedure involves two main steps:\n1.  Introducing the plasmid into *A. ficticius* and selecting for cells that have integrated the entire plasmid into their chromosome via a single homologous recombination event.\n2.  Culturing the successful integrants from step 1 under conditions that select for cells that have undergone a second homologous recombination event, excising the plasmid backbone and resulting in the desired markerless *nifL* deletion.\n\nGiven this experimental design, what is the primary conceptual purpose of including the *sacB* gene on the plasmid?\n\nA. To select for bacterial cells that have successfully integrated the plasmid into their chromosome in the first recombination event.\n\nB. To serve as a reporter gene, causing edited colonies to turn a specific color in the presence of sucrose for easy identification.\n\nC. To enable the selection of cells that have undergone the second recombination event, leading to the excision of the integrated plasmid.\n\nD. To increase the frequency of homologous recombination by destabilizing the bacterial cell wall in the presence of sucrose.\n\nE. To provide a metabolic advantage to the cells that successfully delete the *nifL* gene, allowing them to outgrow unedited cells.", "solution": "The plasmid is a suicide vector in the target bacterium, so it cannot replicate autonomously and must integrate into the chromosome via homologous recombination to be maintained. The first selection for single-crossover integration is provided by the antibiotic resistance gene, *kanR*; thus kanamycin selects for cells that have integrated the plasmid. The *sacB* gene encodes levansucrase, which confers sucrose sensitivity in many gram-negative bacteria; its presence allows negative selection because expression of *sacB* in the presence of sucrose is toxic.\n\nAfter the first integration, the chromosome carries the plasmid backbone including *sacB* and *kanR*. To obtain a markerless deletion, a second homologous recombination event must occur to resolve the integration. This resolution can excise the plasmid backbone, yielding either the original allele or the desired deletion allele, both of which would lose *sacB* and *kanR* if the backbone is excised. Culturing on sucrose selects against cells that still carry *sacB* (i.e., unresolved single-crossover integrants), thereby enriching specifically for cells that have undergone the second recombination event that removes the plasmid backbone.\n\nTherefore, the primary conceptual purpose of *sacB* is to provide counterselection for cells that have executed the second recombination event, enabling excision of the integrated plasmid backbone. Option A is incorrect because initial selection for integration is provided by *kanR*, not *sacB*. Option B is incorrect because *sacB* is not a colorimetric reporter. Option D is incorrect because *sacB* does not increase recombination frequency; it provides negative selection. Option E is incorrect because *sacB* does not provide a metabolic advantage tied to the *nifL* deletion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2035517"}, {"introduction": "Successfully introducing a gene into a non-model organism is only half the battle; getting it to express properly is the other. Many organisms have sophisticated defense mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, that can silence foreign genes, leading to frustratingly low protein production. This problem puts you in the role of a molecular detective, using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) data to test a hypothesis about gene silencing [@problem_id:2035457]. Mastering this type of quantitative analysis is essential for troubleshooting your genetic circuits and rationally improving their performance.", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is attempting to express a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), encoded by the *gfp* gene, in a newly isolated actinomycete species to develop it as a biosensor chassis. They have constructed a plasmid containing a synthetic promoter, `P_syn`, driving the expression of the *gfp* gene. Initial experiments show very weak fluorescence, indicating poor expression. The team hypothesizes that the poor expression is not due to a suboptimal promoter sequence but rather due to a host defense mechanism: silencing of foreign DNA via native DNA methylation.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, they conduct an experiment. They grow two cultures of the engineered actinomycete. The \"control\" culture is grown in standard medium, while the \"treated\" culture is grown in a medium supplemented with a DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor (MTI) that prevents new DNA methylation without affecting cell viability. After a period of growth, they extract total messenger RNA (mRNA) from both cultures, reverse transcribe it into complementary DNA (cDNA), and perform a Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) analysis.\n\nThe qPCR measures the expression level of two genes: the target gene *gfp* and a reference housekeeping gene, *hrdB*, which is known to have stable expression across different conditions. The result of a qPCR experiment is a Cycle threshold (Ct) value, which is the cycle number at which the fluorescence signal crosses a certain threshold. A lower Ct value indicates a higher initial amount of the specific cDNA template, and thus higher expression of the corresponding gene. Assume the amplification efficiency for all qPCR reactions is 100%.\n\nThe average Ct values obtained from the experiment are as follows:\n-   **Control Culture (untreated):**\n    -   Ct for *gfp*: 29.5\n    -   Ct for *hrdB*: 21.0\n-   **Treated Culture (with MTI):**\n    -   Ct for *gfp*: 25.2\n    -   Ct for *hrdB*: 21.3\n\nBased on this data, calculate the fold change of normalized *gfp* gene expression in the MTI-treated culture relative to the untreated control culture. This value quantifies the effect of inhibiting methylation on the expression from the `P_syn` promoter.
