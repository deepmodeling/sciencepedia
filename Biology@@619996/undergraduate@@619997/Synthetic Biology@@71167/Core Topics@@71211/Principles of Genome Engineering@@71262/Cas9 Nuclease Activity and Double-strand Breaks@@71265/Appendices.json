The goal is to insert a fluorescent protein tag immediately after the protein's initial methionine, which corresponds to the `ATG` start codon on the coding strand of the DNA. To achieve this, a precise double-strand break must be created by the Cas9 nuclease immediately following the `ATG` triplet.\n\nThe 5' end of the gene's coding sequence is provided below. The top strand is the coding (non-target) strand, and the bottom strand is the template (target) strand.\n\nCoding Strand: `5’- GCT AGA CCG TTA CGA GCC ATG CGA TGG CTA AAG -3’`\nTemplate Strand: `3’- CGA TCT GGC AAT GCT CGG TAC GCT ACC GAT TTC -5’`\n\nThe activity of the SpCas9-gRNA (guide RNA) complex follows these rules:\n1.  Cas9 recognizes a 3-nucleotide sequence called the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), which has the sequence `5'-NGG-3'` on the non-target DNA strand.\n2.  The gRNA contains a 20-nucleotide spacer region that directs the complex to the desired location. The sequence of this gRNA spacer is identical to the 20-nucleotide DNA sequence on the non-target strand located immediately upstream (5') of the PAM, with the exception that Thymine (T) is replaced by Uracil (U).\n3.  The Cas9 nuclease cleaves both DNA strands exactly 3 base pairs upstream (5') of the PAM sequence.\n\nWhich of the following represents the correct 5' to 3' sequence for the 20-nucleotide gRNA spacer required to create the double-strand break immediately following the `ATG` start codon?\n\nA. `5'-GACCGUUACGAGCCAUGCGA-3'`\n\nB. `5'-GACCGTTACGAGCCATGCGA-3'`\n\nC. `5'-TCGCATGGCTCGTAACGGTC-3'`\n\nD. `5'-UCGCAUGGCUCGUAACGGUC-3'`\n\nE. `5'-AGCAUGCCGAGCUUCAAGGCAG-3'`", "solution": "We want SpCas9 to cut immediately after the coding-strand start codon ATG. The coding (non-target) strand is:\n5'-GCTAGACCGTTACGAGCCATGCGATGGCTAAAG-3'\nIndexing bases from left to right as positions $1,2,\\dots$, the ATG is at positions $19$–$21$, so the desired cut is between positions $21$ and $22$.\n\nFor SpCas9 with a PAM on the non-target (coding) strand:\n- The PAM is $5'$-NGG-$3'$ on the non-target strand.\n- The $20$-nt spacer is identical to the $20$ nucleotides immediately upstream (5') of the PAM on the non-target strand, with T replaced by U in the RNA.\n- The cleavage site is exactly $3$ bp upstream of the PAM, i.e., between bases at indices $p-4$ and $p-3$ on the non-target strand if the PAM starts at index $p$.\n\nWe therefore require the cut between positions $21$ and $22$, which implies\n$$p-4=21 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p-3=22 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad p=25.$$\nThus the PAM must begin at position $25$ on the coding strand. Checking positions $25$–$27$ on the coding strand gives TGG, which matches the required NGG.\n\nThe $20$ nucleotides immediately upstream of this PAM are positions $5$–$24$ on the coding strand:\n5'-GACCGTTACGAGCCATGCGA-3'.\nReplacing T with U to convert DNA to RNA yields the spacer:\n5'-GACCGUUACGAGCCAUGCGA-3'.\n\nThis matches option A. As a final check, with $p=25$, the cut occurs between $p-4=21$ and $p-3=22$, i.e., immediately after the ATG codon at positions $19$–$21$, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2024509"}, {"introduction": "The Cas9 protein functions as a molecular scissor with two distinct nuclease domains, HNH and RuvC, that work together to create a double-strand break. By considering a hypothetical mutant where one domain is inactive, you can explore the specific role each domain plays in the cleavage process [@problem_id:2024478]. This thought experiment is crucial for understanding how scientists have engineered Cas9 variants, like nickases, for more sophisticated applications beyond simple gene knockouts.", "problem": "The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system is a powerful tool for genome editing. The system comprises the Cas9 protein, an endonuclease, and a guide RNA (gRNA) that directs the protein to a specific target sequence in a DNA molecule. The wild-type Cas9 protein possesses two distinct nuclease domains that work in concert to cleave the DNA: the HNH domain and the RuvC domain. By convention, the DNA strand that is complementary to the gRNA's spacer sequence is called the \"target strand,\" and the other strand is the \"non-target strand.\" In a standard cleavage event, the HNH domain cuts the target strand, while the RuvC domain cuts the non-target strand, resulting in a Double-Strand Break (DSB).\n\nConsider a scenario where a synthetic biologist has created a mutant version of the Cas9 protein. In this mutant, the catalytic activity of the RuvC domain has been completely abolished by targeted mutations, but the HNH domain's nuclease activity remains fully functional. All other functions of the protein, including its ability to bind the gRNA and the target DNA, are unaffected.\n\nIf this mutant Cas9-gRNA complex successfully binds to its intended genomic target site, what is the most probable molecular outcome on the DNA?\n\nA. A Double-Strand Break (DSB) is formed at the target site.\n\nB. No cleavage occurs, and the DNA remains completely intact.\n\nC. A single-strand break (a \"nick\") is created exclusively in the non-target strand.\n\nD. The Cas9-gRNA complex fails to bind to the target DNA sequence.\n\nE. A single-strand break (a \"nick\") is created exclusively in the target strand.", "solution": "- By definition, the Cas9 HNH domain cleaves the target strand (the DNA strand complementary to the gRNA spacer), and the RuvC domain cleaves the non-target strand. Coordinated action of both domains yields a double-strand break.\n- In the described mutant, the RuvC domain’s catalytic activity is abolished, while the HNH domain remains fully functional. Binding to gRNA and target DNA is unaffected, so targeting and R-loop formation proceed normally.\n- Upon binding to the correct target, the active HNH domain will cleave the target strand, but the inactive RuvC domain cannot cleave the non-target strand. Therefore, only one strand is cut, producing a single-strand break (nick) specifically in the target strand.\n- Evaluating options:\n  - A is false because a double-strand break requires both HNH and RuvC activities.\n  - B is false because HNH is active and will cleave the target strand.\n  - C is false because the non-target strand is cut by RuvC, which is inactive.\n  - D is false because binding functions are intact.\n  - E is true: a nick in the target strand is produced.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2024478"}, {"introduction": "Successfully inducing a double-strand break with Cas9 is only the beginning of a genome editing experiment; the next challenge is to identify the cells where the edit actually occurred.

This exercise bridges the gap between the theory of gene editing and the practicalities of a successful research project.", "problem": "A researcher is using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to introduce a knockout mutation in a specific gene in a mammalian cell line. The strategy relies on the cell's natural Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, which often introduces small, unpredictable insertion or deletion mutations (indels) at the site of the Cas9-induced double-strand break. The aim is to generate a frameshift mutation that results in a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nAfter delivering the CRISPR-Cas9 components to the cells, the researcher isolates hundreds of individual cell clones. To proceed, they must first perform an initial screen to identify which of these clones likely contain a mutation at the target DNA locus. The ideal screening method should be rapid, cost-effective, and capable of detecting the presence of small, variable indels directly within the genomic DNA.\n\nWhich of the following molecular biology techniques is the most appropriate for this initial screening task?\n\nA. Western Blotting using an antibody that recognizes the target protein.\n\nB. Karyotyping to visualize the full set of chromosomes from each clone.\n\nC.

Southern Blotting of genomic DNA digested with a restriction enzyme that cuts outside the targeted region.", "solution": "The goal is an initial, rapid, and cost-effective screen to identify clones harboring small, variable indels at a defined genomic locus after CRISPR-Cas9 editing via the NHEJ pathway. The screening should operate directly on genomic DNA and be capable of detecting heterogeneous small insertions or deletions without requiring prior knowledge of the exact indel sequence.\n\nAssessing each option against these criteria:\n- Option A (Western Blotting): This detects protein abundance or size, not the presence of a genomic indel. It is indirect and can miss edits due to variable protein stability, nonsense-mediated decay, or in-frame indels that do not abolish antibody epitopes. It is not optimal for initial genotypic screening.\n- Option B (Karyotyping): This visualizes gross chromosomal abnormalities and cannot detect small, locus-specific indels. It is inappropriate for detecting small NHEJ-induced mutations.\n- Option C (Mismatch cleavage assay on PCR products, e.g., T7 Endonuclease I): PCR amplifies the target locus from genomic DNA; upon denaturation and reannealing, heteroduplexes form between wild-type and mutant strands, creating mismatches at indel sites. A mismatch-sensitive nuclease cleaves at these sites, producing characteristic fragments detectable by gel electrophoresis. This approach is rapid, inexpensive, scalable to many clones, and specifically suited to detect small, variable indels at the targeted locus in genomic DNA, fulfilling all stated requirements.\n- Option D (Sanger sequencing of the entire mRNA): This requires RNA extraction and reverse transcription and may yield false negatives due to nonsense-mediated decay reducing mutant mRNA levels. Sequencing the entire transcript is laborious and unnecessarily broad for an initial screen; while precise, it is not the most rapid or cost-effective first pass across hundreds of clones.\n- Option E (Southern Blotting): This is time-consuming, costly, and suited to detecting larger insertions, deletions, or copy number changes, not small indels within a short locus.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate initial screening method is the mismatch cleavage assay on PCR products spanning the target site.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2024487"}]}
