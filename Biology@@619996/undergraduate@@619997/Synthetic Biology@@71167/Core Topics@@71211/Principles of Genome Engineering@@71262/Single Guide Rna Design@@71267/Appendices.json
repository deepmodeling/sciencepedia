This practice explores a critical scenario where a perfectly matching target sequence fails to be edited, highlighting the essential and distinct role of the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). Mastering this concept is the first step toward designing functional guides and troubleshooting unexpected experimental outcomes [@problem_id:2068645].", "problem": "A researcher is using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 genome editing system derived from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpCas9). A key component of this system is the single guide RNA (sgRNA), an engineered molecule comprising two main parts: a ~20-nucleotide 'spacer' region that determines the target DNA sequence through base pairing, and a 'scaffold' region that binds to the SpCas9 protein. The SpCas9 protein will only cleave a DNA target if, in addition to the spacer binding, it recognizes a specific sequence known as the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). For SpCas9, the canonical PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' on the non-target DNA strand, immediately downstream of the region the spacer binds to.\n\nThe researcher has designed an sgRNA that successfully targets and knocks out a specific gene in mouse cells. Upon sequencing, the researcher finds that the 20-nucleotide DNA sequence targeted by the sgRNA's spacer is perfectly conserved in the homologous gene in human cells. However, when the researcher introduces the same SpCas9 protein and the same sgRNA into human cells, the editing experiment completely fails, with no modification of the human gene observed.\n\nAssuming no issues with experimental delivery into the cells, which of the following provides the most direct and crucial molecular explanation for this failure?\n\nA. The sgRNA scaffold region, while functional in mouse cells, is recognized as a foreign RNA and degraded by the innate immune system in human cells.\n\nB. The region of the human gene immediately downstream of the 20-nucleotide target sequence lacks the required 5'-NGG-3' PAM sequence.\n\nC. The human gene is significantly larger in total kilobases than the mouse gene, which sterically hinders the binding of the relatively small CRISPR-Cas9 complex.\n\nD. The codon usage bias of the human gene is different from the mouse gene, interfering with the DNA recognition process by the sgRNA.\n\nE. The sgRNA was designed using a mouse-specific algorithm that incorporates epigenetic markers, rendering it ineffective on the different epigenetic landscape of human chromatin.", "solution": "1) For SpCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes to cleave DNA, two conditions must be met simultaneously: (i) the spacer region of the sgRNA must base-pair with the complementary 20-nucleotide protospacer sequence in the target DNA, and (ii) an appropriate PAM sequence, specifically 5'-NGG-3' for SpCas9, must be present on the non-target DNA strand immediately downstream of the protospacer. Condition (ii) is an absolute requirement for Cas9 binding and nuclease activation; without the PAM, Cas9 does not stably bind or cleave, even if there is perfect spacer-protospacer complementarity.\n\n2) The observation that the 20-nucleotide target sequence is perfectly conserved between mouse and human indicates that condition (i) is satisfied in both species. The complete failure of editing in human cells, despite identical spacers and functional SpCas9, therefore points to a failure of condition (ii): the required 5'-NGG-3' PAM adjacent to the protospacer is likely absent (or altered) in the human locus.\n\n3) Evaluating the options against this mechanistic requirement:\n- Option B states that the region immediately downstream of the 20-nucleotide target in the human gene lacks the required 5'-NGG-3' PAM. This directly explains the failure, as PAM absence categorically prevents Cas9-mediated cleavage despite perfect target matching.\n- Option A proposes species-specific degradation of the sgRNA scaffold by human innate immunity. The commonly used SpCas9 sgRNA scaffold functions across mammalian cells, and innate immune recognition is neither a specific nor a necessary explanation for complete loss of editing under otherwise successful delivery conditions; moreover, it is not the key molecular determinant of Cas9 activity at a given locus.\n- Option C invokes gene size as a steric hindrance to Cas9 binding. Total gene length in kilobases does not impede Cas9â€™s sequence-specific recognition; Cas9 locates targets via diffusion and sequence scanning, independent of gene length.\n- Option D refers to codon usage bias of the gene, which affects protein translation from mRNA and has no bearing on DNA recognition by the RNA-guided nuclease.\n- Option E appeals to species-specific epigenetic differences. While chromatin state can modulate accessibility and efficiency, it is not an absolute requirement in the way a PAM is; many targets in human chromatin are editable if PAM is present. Epigenetic differences do not provide as direct and crucial an explanation as PAM absence.\n\n4) Therefore, the most direct and crucial molecular explanation consistent with the data and Cas9 mechanism is the absence of the required PAM adjacent to the conserved protospacer in the human genome, as stated in Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2068645"}, {"introduction": "A successful gene-editing experiment requires considering all DNA molecules present in the cell, not just the genomic target. This exercise illustrates a critical design flaw where an sgRNA inadvertently targets its own delivery plasmid, a scenario that can lead to complete experimental failure [@problem_id:2068626]. By analyzing the consequences of this oversight, you will learn the importance of verifying your sgRNA sequence against all components of your experimental system.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a researcher aims to use the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to disrupt a specific gene in a line of human cells. The system is delivered into the cells using two separate plasmids. The first plasmid contains the gene encoding the Cas9 nuclease. The second plasmid is an expression vector designed to produce a specific single guide RNA (sgRNA). The sgRNA is a synthetic RNA molecule containing a ~20 nucleotide \"spacer\" sequence, which is complementary to the target gene, and a \"scaffold\" sequence that binds to the Cas9 protein. For the Cas9 nuclease to cleave a DNA target, the target sequence must be complementary to the sgRNA's spacer and must be immediately followed by a specific sequence known as the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM).\n\nThe researcher designs an sgRNA with a spacer sequence that is a perfect match for the intended target gene. However, they neglect to perform a standard bioinformatics check: verifying that the sgRNA's spacer sequence does not also have a complementary target site within the DNA sequence of the plasmid backbone used for its own expression. By unfortunate coincidence, the designed sgRNA's spacer sequence is perfectly complementary to a sequence located on the backbone of its own expression plasmid, and this site is followed by a valid PAM sequence.\n\nAssuming both plasmids are successfully transfected into the cells and begin expressing their respective products (Cas9 and sgRNA), what is the most direct and critical consequence of this oversight?\n\nA. The plasmid expressing the sgRNA will be targeted and cleaved by the Cas9 nuclease, leading to its degradation and preventing a sustained supply of the sgRNA.\n\nB. The sgRNA and Cas9 protein will be expressed, but the sgRNA will preferentially bind back to the plasmid DNA it was transcribed from, preventing it from forming an active complex with Cas9.\n\nC. The sgRNA-Cas9 complex will be sequestered by binding to the sgRNA expression plasmid but will be unable to cleave the plasmid DNA, thus preventing the complex from reaching its intended genomic target.\n\nD. The sgRNA-Cas9 complex will successfully cleave both the plasmid and the genomic target, but the fragments of the cleaved plasmid will trigger a potent antiviral response that kills the host cell.\n\nE. The sgRNA-Cas9 complex will bind to the origin of replication on the sgRNA plasmid, causing the plasmid to replicate uncontrollably and leading to cellular toxicity.", "solution": "Define the components: plasmid $P_{1}$ encodes Cas9; plasmid $P_{2}$ encodes an sgRNA composed of a spacer sequence $s$ and a scaffold. The Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein forms when Cas9 binds the sgRNA; denote this complex by $R = \\text{Cas9} : \\text{sgRNA}$. A necessary condition for Cas9 to cleave a DNA target is that the DNA contains a protospacer $T$ that is complementary to $s$ and is immediately followed by a valid PAM (for SpCas9, typically 5'-NGG-3'). Under these conditions, $R$ binds the target and introduces a site-specific double-strand break a few base pairs upstream of the PAM.\n\nBy oversight, $P_{2}$ contains a sequence $U$ such that $U$ is the complement of $s$ and is immediately followed by a valid PAM. Therefore, once both plasmids are expressed, the complex $R$ will recognize and bind $U$ on $P_{2}$ and cleave it. Cleavage of a circular plasmid yields a linearized DNA molecule and/or fragments. In mammalian cells, linearized plasmid DNA is rapidly degraded or subject to error-prone repair that disrupts function, thereby reducing or abolishing transcription from $P_{2}$. Consequently, the sustained production of sgRNA is lost or severely diminished, compromising continued genome targeting.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A states that the sgRNA-expressing plasmid will be targeted and cleaved, leading to its degradation and preventing a sustained supply of sgRNA. This directly follows from the Cas9 requirement for spacer complementarity and PAM and the observed self-target site on $P_{2}$.\n- B is incorrect because sgRNA does not preferentially bind DNA by itself; it forms the active complex with Cas9, which then targets DNA.\n- C is incorrect because, given perfect complementarity and a valid PAM, Cas9 will cleave; it will not merely bind without cleavage.\n- D is incorrect as the most direct and critical consequence is plasmid cleavage and loss of sgRNA supply; invoking a potent antiviral response is speculative and not the primary expected outcome.\n- E is incorrect because Cas9 targeting does not induce plasmid over-replication; it causes cleavage.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and critical consequence is described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2068626"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply finding a valid target, advanced sgRNA design involves selecting the guide with the highest probability of success. This practice moves into the realm of optimization, where multiple factors are weighed to rank candidate guides for a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) experiment [@problem_id:2068607]. You will learn how to quantitatively integrate predictive scores with experimental data on chromatin accessibility to make a data-driven design choice.", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is designing a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) experiment to repress the transcription of a specific gene of interest in a human cell line. The efficacy of a single guide RNA (sgRNA) in a CRISPRi system depends on two primary factors: (1) its intrinsic on-target binding and repression activity, and (2) the accessibility of its target DNA sequence within the native chromatin structure. To maximize the chances of successful gene repression, the team wishes to select the single best sgRNA from a list of candidates.\n\nThe on-target activity for each sgRNA is predicted by a machine learning model, yielding a score, $S_{\\text{on}}$, which ranges from 0 (no activity) to 1 (maximal activity). The chromatin accessibility at each sgRNA's target site is experimentally measured using an Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq). The data is processed to yield a normalized accessibility score, $S_{\\text{acc}}$, also ranging from 0 (completely inaccessible, likely compacted in a nucleosome) to 1 (fully accessible, located in a nucleosome-depleted region).\n\nTo integrate these two metrics, a composite \"Efficacy Score,\" $E$, is calculated for each sgRNA. The score is a weighted sum of the on-target score and the accessibility score.
