The dCas9 protein requires a specific DNA landmark, the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), to initiate binding next to its target sequence. This practice [@problem_id:2028682] challenges you to apply this fundamental rule to troubleshoot a hypothetical experiment, reinforcing a critical concept for effective gRNA design.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology laboratory, a student is attempting to repress the expression of a specific gene using the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technique. This system utilizes a catalytically dead Cas9 protein (dCas9) from *Streptococcus pyogenes*, which is guided by a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to a target DNA sequence. The dCas9 protein then acts as a physical roadblock to prevent transcription, thereby silencing the gene.\n\nFor the dCas9/sgRNA complex to bind successfully, a specific sequence known as the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) must be present on the DNA. For the *Streptococcus pyogenes* dCas9 used in this experiment, the PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3', where 'N' can be any of the four DNA bases (A, T, C, or G). This PAM sequence must be located on the non-target DNA strand, immediately downstream (to the 3' end) of the 20-nucleotide \"protospacer\" sequence that the dCas9/sgRNA complex recognizes.\n\nThe student has identified five potential 20-nucleotide protospacer sequences within the gene's coding strand (which serves as the non-target strand). However, upon running the experiment with one of these chosen targets, no gene repression was observed. Assuming the sgRNA was synthesized correctly and successfully transformed, a failure in dCas9 binding is the most likely cause.\n\nBelow are the five potential target sites that were considered. Each option lists a 20-nucleotide protospacer sequence (represented by \"...\") and the three nucleotides that immediately follow it on the 3' end of the same DNA strand. Which of the following sites represents an invalid target that would cause the CRISPRi experiment to fail due to the absence of a correct PAM sequence?\n\nA.

Protospacer: 5'-...-3', Immediately followed by: 5'-GAG-3'\n\nE. Protospacer: 5'-...-3', Immediately followed by: 5'-GGG-3'", "solution": "The dCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes requires a PAM of the form 5'-NGG-3' located on the non-target DNA strand immediately downstream (at the 3' end) of the 20-nt protospacer. Here, the protospacer is on the coding (non-target) strand, and the three nucleotides listed are exactly in the PAM position. Therefore, a valid target must have the three nucleotides equal to N followed by two G bases.\n\nEvaluate each option by checking whether the three nucleotides match the NGG pattern:\n- A: CGG matches NGG with N = C; valid.\n- B: AGG matches NGG with N = A; valid.\n- C: TGG matches NGG with N = T; valid.\n- D: GAG does not match NGG because the second position is A, not G; invalid.\n- E: GGG matches NGG with N = G; valid.\n\nTherefore, the invalid target lacking the correct PAM is option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2028682"}, {"introduction": "CRISPR interference acts by creating a physical roadblock for transcription, a mechanism with consequences that can extend beyond the targeted gene. In organisms with compact genomes like bacteria, genes are often organized into operons, transcribed together as a single unit. This exercise [@problem_id:2028735] asks you to predict the outcome of targeting a gene within an operon, deepening your understanding of these 'polar effects' and the importance of genomic context in experimental design.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is studying a newly characterized bacterial operon, the `illum` operon, which is essential for the production of a specific biofilm-stabilizing protein complex. The operon consists of a single promoter, $P_{\\text{illum}}$, followed by three distinct genes in sequential order: $geneX$, $geneY$, and $geneZ$. The transcription of all three genes from the promoter results in a single, polycistronic messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. The protein products of all three genes are required for the final function.\n\nTo study the function of $geneX$, the biologist employs the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) interference (CRISPRi) system. This system utilizes a catalytically deactivated \"dead\" Cas9 protein (dCas9), which can bind to a specific DNA sequence guided by a single guide RNA (sgRNA) but cannot cleave the DNA. When the dCas9-sgRNA complex binds to its target, it acts as a physical roadblock, sterically hindering RNA polymerase and thus repressing transcription initiation or elongation.\n\nThe biologist designs an sgRNA that specifically targets the dCas9 protein to the beginning of the coding sequence of $geneX$, immediately downstream of the $P_{\\text{illum}}$ promoter. Assuming the CRISPRi system is 100% effective at blocking transcription at its target site, what would be the expected effect on the expression of $geneY$ and $geneZ$?\n\nA. The expression of $geneY$ and $geneZ$ will be unaffected, while the expression of $geneX$ is repressed.\n\nB. The expression of both $geneY$ and $geneZ$ will be significantly reduced or completely repressed.\n\nC. The expression of $geneY$ and $geneZ$ will increase to compensate for the loss of the $geneX$ product.\n\nD. The dCas9 protein will cut the DNA at the $geneX$ site, causing a frameshift mutation that disrupts the reading frames for $geneY$ and $geneZ$.\n\nE. Transcription will proceed normally, but the dCas9 complex will block the ribosome, preventing translation of $geneX$ while allowing translation of $geneY$ and $geneZ$.", "solution": "An operon with a single promoter produces a single polycistronic mRNA containing all downstream cistrons in order. Here, promoter $P_{\\text{illum}}$ drives a transcript that includes $geneX$, $geneY$, and $geneZ$ on the same mRNA. Expression of $geneY$ and $geneZ$ requires RNA polymerase to initiate at $P_{\\text{illum}}$ and successfully elongate through the coding regions of $geneX$ and into $geneY$ and $geneZ$.\n\nCRISPR interference with dCas9 does not cleave DNA; instead, the dCas9â€“sgRNA complex binds DNA at the specified target and functions as a steric roadblock to RNA polymerase. Targeting the beginning of the $geneX$ coding sequence, immediately downstream of $P_{\\text{illum}}$, will block transcription initiation from proceeding into elongation or will halt elongation at that site.\n\nGiven the assumption that CRISPRi is completely effective at its target site, RNA polymerase cannot transcribe beyond the start of $geneX$. Therefore, the polycistronic mRNA segments corresponding to $geneY$ and $geneZ$ will not be synthesized. Consequently, the protein products of $geneY$ and $geneZ$ will be significantly reduced or absent.\n\nThus, the expected outcome is that both $geneY$ and $geneZ$ expression are significantly reduced or completely repressed, while dCas9 does not cut DNA and does not act on ribosomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2028735"}, {"introduction": "Moving from design to validation, a key question is: how effective was the gene knockdown?
