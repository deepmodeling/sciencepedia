This practice challenges you to think like an experimental biologist by dissecting the purpose of different control groups. You will learn to distinguish the specific consequences of on-target gene editing from non-specific cellular stress, a crucial step in validating any gene editing outcome [@problem_id:2074732].", "problem": "A team of researchers in a synthetic biology lab is investigating the function of a newly discovered gene, `GENE_X`, in human cancer cells. Their hypothesis is that `GENE_X` is essential for cell survival. To test this, they plan to use the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to create a knockout of `GENE_X`.\n\nTheir experimental design includes the following groups of cultured cells:\n1.  **Untreated Cells**: A culture of cells that receives no treatment.\n2.  **Mock Transfection**: Cells treated with the delivery agent (e.g., a lipid-based transfection reagent) but without any plasmid DNA.\n3.  **Experimental Group**: Cells transfected with plasmids encoding the Cas9 nuclease and a guide RNA (gRNA) specifically designed to target and cut `GENE_X`.\n4.  **Control Group A**: Cells transfected with a plasmid encoding a reporter protein like Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) instead of the CRISPR components.\n5.  **Control Group B**: Cells transfected with plasmids encoding the Cas9 nuclease and a \"non-targeting\" gRNA. This non-targeting gRNA has been bioinformatically designed to have no complementary sequence anywhere in the human genome.\n\nAfter 72 hours, the researchers observe significant cell death in the Experimental Group (Group 3). They now need to interpret this result correctly by comparing it to the control groups. What is the primary scientific purpose of including Control Group B (Cas9 + non-targeting gRNA) in this experiment?\n\nA. To verify that the delivery system for the CRISPR components is efficient and can successfully introduce plasmids into the cells.\n\nB. To measure any non-specific cellular toxicity or stress response caused by the introduction and expression of the Cas9 protein and a guide RNA molecule.\n\nC. To confirm that the Cas9 nuclease is enzymatically active and capable of inducing double-strand breaks in the genome.\n\nD. To quantify the frequency of off-target cleavage events caused by the specific guide RNA targeting `GENE_X`.\n\nE. To act as a \"no-treatment\" control, representing the baseline health and growth rate of the unmanipulated cell culture.", "solution": "The experiment uses multiple control groups to isolate the specific cause of the observed phenotype (cell death) in the experimental group where Cas9 and a GENE_X-targeting gRNA are expressed. To interpret whether the cell death is due to specific on-target cleavage of GENE_X or due to non-specific effects of the CRISPR components and transfection, each control serves a distinct purpose.\n\nUntreated cells establish the baseline phenotype without any manipulation. Mock transfection controls for toxicity from the delivery reagent alone. A GFP transfection control verifies delivery and expression capability of the system without CRISPR components. The critical role of the Cas9 plus non-targeting gRNA control is to mimic the expression of Cas9 and a gRNA while avoiding any genomic target, thereby not producing double-strand breaks. Thus, any phenotype observed in this control reflects non-specific cellular responses to the introduction and expression of Cas9 and a gRNA (e.g., transfection stress, Cas9 overexpression, gRNA expression, innate immune responses), rather than on-target gene disruption.\n\nTherefore, comparing the experimental group to this control allows attributing additional cell death specifically to the intended on-target action at GENE_X. This directly matches option B and is not primarily for verifying delivery efficiency (A), confirming nuclease activity via cleavage (C), quantifying off-targets of the GENE_X gRNA (D), or serving as a baseline no-treatment control (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2074732"}, {"introduction": "Once you have performed a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout experiment, how do you quickly determine if you successfully created mutations? This exercise walks you through the T7 Endonuclease I (T7E1) assay, a classic method for detecting the small insertions and deletions (indels) generated by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) repair. By analyzing the expected results, you will gain hands-on understanding of how to interpret data from a common gene editing validation technique [@problem_id:2074725].", "problem": "A research team is using the Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to disrupt a target gene in a culture of mammalian cells. The editing process is known to be imperfect, resulting in a mixed population of cells: some remain unedited (wild-type), while others acquire small insertion or deletion mutations (indels) at the target site due to the cell's DNA repair mechanisms.\n\nTo screen for successful editing, the researchers perform a T7 Endonuclease I (T7E1) assay. The protocol is as follows:\n1.  A specific 800 base pair (bp) DNA segment, which encompasses the CRISPR target site, is amplified from the genomic DNA of the entire cell population using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).\n2.  The resulting PCR products, a mixture of wild-type and indel-containing amplicons, are denatured by heating to separate the DNA double helices into single strands.\n3.  The mixture is then slowly cooled, allowing the single strands to re-anneal into double-stranded DNA. This produces a mix of fully matched homoduplexes and mismatched heteroduplexes.\n4.  The re-annealed DNA is treated with the T7E1 enzyme, which specifically recognizes and cleaves both strands of the DNA backbone at the site of a base-pair mismatch. It does not cut perfectly matched DNA.\n\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 target site, and thus the location of the indels, is located exactly 320 bp from the 5' end of the 800 bp PCR amplicon. Assuming the T7E1 digestion proceeds to completion, which of the following sets of DNA fragment sizes would be expected upon analyzing the reaction products using agarose gel electrophoresis?\n\nA. 320 bp and 480 bp\n\nB. 800 bp\n\nC. 320 bp, 480 bp, and 800 bp\n\nD. 320 bp and 800 bp\n\nE. 480 bp and 800 bp", "solution": "The PCR amplifies a single locus to produce an $800$ base pair amplicon from a mixed cell population containing wild-type (WT) and indel alleles. After denaturation and re-annealing, duplexes form in four classes: WT/WT and indel/indel homoduplexes (perfectly matched) and WT/indel (and potentially indel/indel of different indel types) heteroduplexes containing a mismatch at the CRISPR site. T7 Endonuclease I cleaves both strands at mismatches but does not cut perfectly matched duplexes.\n\nThe mismatch is located at a fixed position $320$ base pairs from the $5^{\\prime}$ end of the $800$ base pair amplicon. Therefore, T7E1 cleavage at this site splits a heteroduplex molecule into two fragments whose lengths equal the distances from the cleavage site to each end: one fragment of length $320$ and the other of length $480$, satisfying $320+480=800$.\n\nUnder complete digestion, all heteroduplexes yield fragments of $320$ and $480$, while WT/WT and indel/indel homoduplexes remain intact at $800$. Consequently, agarose gel electrophoresis will show three bands corresponding to $320$, $480$, and $800$ base pairs.

Valid Ala codons are GCT, GCC, GCA, GCG. A minimal change is TCA → GCA (Ser to Ala by changing the first base of the codon from T to G). Implementing this within the sequence yields:\n... CAG TCA GAT ... → ... CAG GCA GAT ....\nIn the full sequence, this corresponds to changing ...CCAGTCAGAT... to ...CCAGGCAGAT....\n\nNext, identify and recode the PAM to prevent re-cutting by SpCas9. SpCas9 recognizes the 5'-NGG-3' PAM. In the provided coding strand, immediately after the GAT codon is CGG (the Arg codon), which constitutes an NGG motif on the coding strand. To disrupt the PAM without altering the encoded amino acid, choose a synonymous Arg codon that is not NGG. A suitable choice is CGA (Arg), which changes CGG → CGA and breaks the NGG motif while maintaining the Arg residue.\n\nCombine both changes in-frame. After applying TCA → GCA and CGG → CGA, the codon series becomes:\nACA GAG CTG CTC CAG GCA GAT CGA CTA GCC,\nwhich preserves the protein sequence except for the intended Ser→Ala substitution and recodes the PAM synonymously at the Arg codon.\n\nMatch this edited sequence to the provided options.
