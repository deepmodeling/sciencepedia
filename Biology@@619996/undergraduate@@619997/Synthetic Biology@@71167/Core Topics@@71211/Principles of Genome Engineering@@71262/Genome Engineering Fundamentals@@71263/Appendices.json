{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A successful genome engineering experiment begins with a clever design. When using Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) to insert or modify a sequence, a common pitfall is that the newly repaired DNA can be re-targeted and cut again by the Cas9 enzyme. This thought experiment challenges you to devise a strategy to outsmart the enzyme, ensuring that once your desired edit is made, it remains permanent. Understanding this principle is key to moving from simply using CRISPR to designing robust and highly efficient editing protocols [@problem_id:2040663].", "problem": "In a genome engineering experiment utilizing the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system, a researcher aims to introduce a specific point mutation into a target gene in a mammalian cell line. The strategy involves co-transfecting the cells with a plasmid expressing the Cas9 nuclease and a specific guide RNA (gRNA), along with a linear, double-stranded DNA donor template for repair.\n\nThe gRNA is designed to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific 20-nucleotide \"protospacer\" sequence in the target gene. Cas9 binding and cleavage also strictly require the presence of a specific 3-nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of the protospacer, known as the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). For the commonly used *Streptococcus pyogenes* Cas9, this PAM sequence is NGG, where N is any nucleotide. The Cas9-gRNA complex introduces a double-strand break (DSB) within the protospacer.\n\nThe cell's natural Homology Directed Repair (HDR) pathway is intended to repair this DSB using the provided donor template. This template contains the desired point mutation flanked by \"homology arms\"—sequences identical to the regions immediately upstream and downstream of the DSB. If HDR occurs successfully, the desired mutation is incorporated into the genome.\n\nA critical challenge in this process is that a successful HDR event perfectly reconstitutes the original protospacer and PAM sequence, making the newly edited locus a target for re-cutting by the still-present Cas9-gRNA complex. This can lead to a cycle of cutting and repair, increasing the chance of error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and reducing the yield of correctly edited cells.\n\nWhich of the following modifications to the design of the donor DNA template represents the most direct and effective strategy to prevent the Cas9 nuclease from re-cutting the genomic locus after a successful HDR event?\n\nA. Significantly increasing the length of the homology arms on the donor template to over 2000 base pairs each.\n\nB. Designing the donor template to include an additional \"silent\" mutation within the 3-nucleotide PAM sequence, such that the integrated sequence will not be recognized by Cas9, but any potential protein product remains unchanged.\n\nC. Attaching a fluorescent protein gene, like Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), to one end of the donor template outside of the homology arms.\n\nD. Synthesizing the donor template with chemically modified phosphodiester bonds that are resistant to nuclease degradation.\n\nE. Introducing multiple non-synonymous mutations into the homology arm sequences of the donor template.", "solution": "The CRISPR-Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes requires two conditions for cleavage: a gRNA-matched protospacer and an immediately downstream PAM with sequence NGG. After HDR with an unmodified donor, the locus restores both the protospacer and the PAM, allowing the Cas9-gRNA to bind again, cleave, and trigger additional repair cycles. Therefore, the most direct way to prevent re-cutting after a successful HDR is to change the sequence in a way that abolishes Cas9 recognition while preserving the intended protein product.\n\nDirectly disrupting the PAM prevents Cas9 binding regardless of perfect protospacer complementarity. Introducing a synonymous (silent) mutation within the PAM region achieves this: it changes the DNA sequence so that it is no longer NGG (for example, to NGC or NGT), thereby abrogating Cas9 binding, while leaving the encoded amino acid unchanged. This strategy is standard practice to immunize the edited locus against re-cutting.\n\nAssessment of the options:\nA. Increasing homology arm length can improve HDR efficiency in some contexts but does not alter the protospacer or PAM sequence; it does not prevent Cas9 from re-cutting after HDR.\nB. Introducing a silent mutation in the PAM directly disrupts Cas9 recognition and prevents re-cutting, while maintaining the protein sequence; this is the most direct and effective design change to solve the stated problem.\nC. Adding GFP outside the homology arms will not be incorporated via HDR and does not affect the PAM or protospacer; it does not prevent re-cutting.\nD. Chemically stabilizing the donor template may increase its persistence but does not alter the target site’s susceptibility to Cas9; it does not prevent re-cutting.\nE. Multiple non-synonymous mutations in homology arms would likely alter the protein and reduce homology, impairing HDR, and still might not remove the PAM; it is counterproductive and does not directly address re-cutting.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and effective modification is to mutate the PAM silently so that Cas9 can no longer recognize the edited locus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2040663"}, {"introduction": "After performing a genome editing experiment, the crucial next step is to identify which cells have been successfully modified. This practice places you in the role of a researcher who needs to determine the precise genotype of isolated cell clones. You will apply your knowledge of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to design an assay that can distinguish between wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous edited cells on a simple agarose gel. This exercise solidifies the connection between a genetic change at the DNA level and its tangible, observable result in a standard laboratory analysis [@problem_id:2040703].", "problem": "A researcher in a synthetic biology lab is using CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer a human cell line. The goal is to insert a 24-base-pair (bp) DNA sequence, which encodes a small peptide tag, immediately before the stop codon of a target gene, \"Gene Y\", via Homology-Directed Repair (HDR). After the experiment, the researcher has isolated several cell clones and needs to determine their genotype at the Gene Y locus. The possible genotypes are: wild-type (WT/WT), heterozygous for the insertion (WT/HDR), or homozygous for the insertion (HDR/HDR).\n\nThe researcher plans to use a single Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tube for each clone, followed by standard agarose gel electrophoresis to analyze the products. Which of the following primer design strategies is the most effective for unambiguously distinguishing between the WT/WT, WT/HDR, and HDR/HDR genotypes in this single-tube assay?\n\nA. Design a forward primer that anneals approximately 150 bp upstream of the insertion site and a reverse primer that anneals approximately 150 bp downstream of the insertion site.\n\nB.

The core principle is that PCR amplifies the sequence between the primer binding sites; therefore, an insertion of known length within that interval shifts the amplicon size by the insertion length. Standard agarose gels distinguish bands based on size differences; to be unambiguous in a single reaction, the assay must generate either distinct amplicon sizes for each allele or allele-specific amplification patterns that uniquely map to each genotype.\n\nConsider option A. With a forward primer upstream and a reverse primer downstream of the insertion site, the wild-type amplicon length is\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{WT}} = L_{\\mathrm{flank}},\n$$\nwhere $L_{\\mathrm{flank}}$ is the distance between primer binding sites in the unmodified locus. For the HDR allele carrying the 24 bp insertion between the same primer sites, the amplicon length is\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{HDR}} = L_{\\mathrm{flank}} + 24.\n$$\nOn a standard gel, a heterozygote (WT/HDR) will produce two bands of sizes $L_{\\mathrm{flank}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{flank}}+24$, while WT/WT will produce only $L_{\\mathrm{flank}}$ and HDR/HDR only $L_{\\mathrm{flank}}+24$. This yields a unique and unambiguous banding pattern for all three genotypes within a single tube. The provided approximate placement (about 150 bp upstream and downstream) makes $L_{\\mathrm{flank}}$ on the order of a few hundred base pairs, for which a 24 bp size difference is typically resolvable on standard agarose.\n\nConsider option B. A forward primer entirely within the 24 bp insert paired with a downstream reverse primer amplifies only the HDR allele. The expected outcomes are: no band for WT/WT, one band for WT/HDR, and one band for HDR/HDR. Because WT/HDR and HDR/HDR both yield a single band, they are not distinguishable unambiguously in a single tube by band presence or intensity alone.\n\nConsider option C. Placing the forward primer at the gene start over approximately $5{,}000$ bp upstream creates an amplicon exceeding $5{,}000$ bp. The HDR allele differs by only 24 bp, so the size difference between $L_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{HDR}}$ is negligible relative to total length and is not resolvable on a standard gel. Additionally, routine PCR across such a long distance is inefficient and unreliable under standard conditions, compromising assay robustness.\n\nConsider option D. A reverse primer designed to anneal only to the unmodified WT sequence at the insertion site, paired with an upstream forward primer, yields amplification only from the WT allele. The outcomes are: one band for WT/WT, one band for WT/HDR, and no band for HDR/HDR. Because WT/WT and WT/HDR both produce a band, they are not distinguishable unambiguously in a single tube with this single primer pair.\n\nOnly option A produces distinct size-resolved products for both alleles in a single reaction, allowing unambiguous discrimination among WT/WT, WT/HDR, and HDR/HDR on a standard agarose gel.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2040703"}, {"introduction": "Before committing to the time-consuming process of isolating and genotyping individual cell clones, it is often essential to get a quick, quantitative measure of how well the editing worked across the entire cell population. This problem walks you through the interpretation of a T7 Endonuclease I assay, a widely used method for estimating the frequency of mutations generated by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ).

The primary DNA repair mechanism following the Cas9-induced double-strand break is Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), an error-prone process that creates a variety of small insertions and deletions (indels).\n\nTo estimate the frequency of these indel mutations, the researcher performs a T7 Endonuclease I mismatch cleavage assay. First, a 500 base pair (bp) region of the target gene is amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) from the genomic DNA of the entire cell population. The resulting PCR products are then denatured and re-annealed, allowing for the formation of homoduplexes (wild-type/wild-type or mutant/mutant) and heteroduplexes (wild-type/mutant).\n\nThe re-annealed DNA is treated with T7 Endonuclease I, which specifically recognizes and cleaves mismatched DNA, and the products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Assume that the NHEJ process creates a highly diverse pool of indel mutations, such that any re-annealed duplex containing at least one mutant allele (i.e., wild-type/mutant or mutant/mutant pairs of different indel types) will form a mismatch that is cleaved by T7 Endonuclease I. Only wild-type/wild-type homoduplexes will remain uncut.\n\nDensitometry analysis of the resulting gel provides the following integrated band intensities:\n- Uncut parental band (500 bp): 6000 arbitrary units\n- Cleavage product 1 (approx. 300 bp): 2000 arbitrary units\n- Cleavage product 2 (approx. 200 bp): 2000 arbitrary units\n\nAssuming the PCR amplification was unbiased and the DNA strands re-annealed randomly, calculate the fraction of the initial DNA alleles that contain an indel mutation due to NHEJ.
