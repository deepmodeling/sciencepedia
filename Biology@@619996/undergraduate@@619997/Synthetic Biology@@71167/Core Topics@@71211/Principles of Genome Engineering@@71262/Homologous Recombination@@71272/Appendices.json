This first practice exercise focuses on the 'blueprint' stage of genome engineering, where you'll calculate the impact of inserting a multi-gene operon on the total size of a bacterial chromosome [@problem_id:2042177]. This fundamental calculation is crucial for planning and understanding the large-scale architectural changes made to a genome.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is engineering an *Escherichia coli* strain to produce a valuable biocompound. This requires the stable integration of a new three-gene metabolic operon into the bacterial chromosome. The chosen method is homologous recombination, using a linear double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) donor template. The target for integration is a well-characterized \"safe harbor\" locus, which contains a non-essential native gene, *yfgA*. The engineering strategy is to replace the entire *yfgA* gene with the new operon.\n\nThe linear donor DNA is designed with the following structure: a 5' homology arm, the operon payload, and a 3' homology arm. The homology arms are complementary to the genomic regions immediately flanking the *yfgA* gene.\n\nThe operon payload itself is composed of several genetic parts arranged sequentially:\n1.  A constitutive promoter to drive transcription.\n2.  A Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) for the first gene.\n3.  The Coding Sequence (CDS) of the first gene, *geneX*.\n4.  A second RBS.\n5.  The CDS of the second gene, *geneY*.\n6.  A third RBS.\n7.  The CDS of the third gene, *geneZ*.\n8.  A rho-independent terminator to end transcription.\n\nThe lengths of these components in base pairs (bp) are given as follows:\n-   Length of the promoter: $L_P = 85$ bp\n-   Length of each RBS (all three are identical): $L_{RBS} = 28$ bp\n-   Length of the *geneX* CDS: $L_X = 1257$ bp\n-   Length of the *geneY* CDS: $L_Y = 921$ bp\n-   Length of the *geneZ* CDS: $L_Z = 1434$ bp\n-   Length of the terminator: $L_T = 110$ bp\n-   Length of the *yfgA* gene to be deleted: $L_{del} = 880$ bp\n\nThe homology arms themselves are necessary for the recombination machinery but do not contribute to the final inserted sequence length. Assuming the homologous recombination event is successful and precisely replaces the *yfgA* gene with the operon payload, calculate the net change in the total length of the *E. coli* chromosome. Express your answer as an integer number of base pairs.", "solution": "We seek the net change in chromosome length after replacing the native gene *yfgA* with a multi-gene operon via homologous recombination. The homology arms mediate recombination but do not change the final sequence length because they are identical to the genomic regions flanking *yfgA*. Thus, the net change equals the inserted payload length minus the deleted gene length.\n\nDefine the payload length:\n$$\nL_{\\text{payload}}=L_{P}+3L_{RBS}+L_{X}+L_{Y}+L_{Z}+L_{T}\n$$\nSubstitute the given values:\n$$\nL_{\\text{payload}}=85+3\\cdot 28+1257+921+1434+110\n$$\nCompute the RBS contribution:\n$$\n3\\cdot 28=84\n$$\nSum the coding sequences:\n$$\nL_{X}+L_{Y}+L_{Z}=1257+921+1434=3612\n$$\nAdd promoter and RBS:\n$$\n3612+85=3697, \\quad 3697+84=3781\n$$\nAdd terminator:\n$$\n3781+110=3891\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nL_{\\text{payload}}=3891\n$$\nThe net change in chromosome length is the payload length minus the deleted *yfgA* length:\n$$\n\\Delta L=L_{\\text{payload}}-L_{\\text{del}}=3891-880=3011\n$$\nHence, the chromosome increases by $3011$ base pairs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3011}$$", "id": "2042177"}, {"introduction": "After performing a gene editing experiment, the next critical step is to verify whether the intended genetic modification was successful. This practice simulates a common verification method: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), used to screen colonies for a successful gene knockout [@problem_id:2042166]. By calculating and comparing the expected sizes of PCR products from wild-type and engineered cells, you will learn the core principle behind this powerful diagnostic technique.", "problem": "A student in a synthetic biology laboratory is tasked with creating a knockout of the *lacZ* gene in an *E. coli* strain. The coding sequence of the wild-type *lacZ* gene has a length of $L_G = 3075$ base pairs (bp). The experimental strategy involves using homologous recombination to precisely replace the entire *lacZ* coding sequence with a chloramphenicol resistance marker cassette (*cat*), which has a known length of $L_M = 660$ bp.\n\nTo screen the resulting bacterial colonies and identify successful knockouts, the student will perform a colony Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). A specific pair of oligonucleotide primers, a forward primer $P_{fwd}$ and a reverse primer $P_{rev}$, have been designed. These primers are designed to bind to conserved regions of the bacterial chromosome that flank the *lacZ* gene. The binding site for the forward primer, $P_{fwd}$, is located at a position $D_U = 225$ bp upstream of the *lacZ* start codon. The binding site for the reverse primer, $P_{rev}$, is located at a position $D_D = 170$ bp downstream of the *lacZ* stop codon.\n\nCalculate the expected size of the PCR product (amplicon) in base pairs for the following two scenarios:\n1.  A wild-type colony where the *lacZ* gene remains unaltered.\n2.  A successful knockout colony where the *lacZ* coding sequence has been perfectly replaced by the *cat* marker cassette.\n\nPresent your answer as a row matrix containing two integer values, `[WT_size, KO_size]`, where `WT_size` corresponds to the amplicon size from the wild-type colony and `KO_size` corresponds to the amplicon size from the successful knockout colony. The values should be in units of base pairs.", "solution": "The primers flank the target locus; therefore, the PCR amplicon spans the upstream flanking region from the forward primer binding site to the start codon, the sequence replacing the coding region (wild-type gene or marker cassette), and the downstream flanking region from the stop codon to the reverse primer binding site.\n\nLet $L_{G}$ be the wild-type gene length, $L_{M}$ be the marker cassette length, $D_{U}$ be the upstream distance from the forward primer binding site to the start codon, and $D_{D}$ be the downstream distance from the stop codon to the reverse primer binding site.

This exercise challenges you to analyze a common scenario in a diploid organism like yeast, where a screening PCR yields two distinct bands instead of one [@problem_id:2042181]. Understanding such outcomes is key to correctly identifying heterozygous genotypes and is an essential skill for working with more complex eukaryotic systems.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a researcher aims to knock out a specific gene, *synA*, in a diploid strain of the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The strategy involves homologous recombination to replace the entire *synA* open reading frame with a selectable marker cassette, *kanR*, which confers resistance to the antibiotic G418. The *synA* gene has a length of 3.1 kilobases (kb), while the *kanR* marker cassette is 1.5 kb long.\n\nAfter transforming the yeast and selecting for G418-resistant colonies, the researcher picks a single, well-isolated colony for verification. A genomic DNA sample is prepared from this colony and used as a template for a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). A single pair of primers is used for this screening PCR; the forward primer binds to a sequence 200 base pairs (bp) upstream of the *synA* start codon, and the reverse primer binds to a sequence 200 bp downstream of the *synA* stop codon. Therefore, these primers flank the entire region targeted for replacement.\n\nUpon analyzing the PCR products via gel electrophoresis, the researcher observes two distinct DNA bands: one with a size of approximately 3.5 kb and another with a size of approximately 1.9 kb.\n\nAssuming the colony is clonal (i.e., originated from a single progenitor cell) and that no other major chromosomal rearrangements have occurred, which of the following statements best describes the genotype of the cells within this colony with respect to the *synA* locus?\n\nA. The cells are homozygous for the wild-type *synA* gene.\nB. The cells are homozygous for the *kanR* knockout allele.\nC. The cells are heterozygous, containing one wild-type *synA* allele and one *kanR* knockout allele.\nD. The *kanR* cassette integrated randomly into the genome at a non-homologous location, leaving both original *synA* alleles intact.\nE. The colony is not clonal and is actually a mixture of two distinct populations: wild-type cells and cells that are homozygous for the *kanR* knockout allele.", "solution": "We are screening a diploid yeast strain for homologous replacement of the entire *synA* open reading frame by a *kanR* cassette, using a single PCR primer pair that binds to genomic sequences flanking the targeted region: the forward primer binds 200 base pairs upstream of the *synA* start codon and the reverse primer binds 200 base pairs downstream of the *synA* stop codon. By PCR principles, the amplicon length equals the total length of DNA between the primer binding sites; therefore the expected PCR product depends on what sequence lies between these flanking sites.\n\nLet $L_{\\text{synA}}=3.1 \\text{ kb}$ be the length of the *synA* ORF, $L_{\\text{kanR}}=1.5 \\text{ kb}$ be the length of the *kanR* cassette, and let the added flanking distance contributed by the primer positions be $L_{\\text{flank}}=0.4 \\text{ kb}$ (since $200 \\text{ bp}$ upstream plus $200 \\text{ bp}$ downstream equals $400 \\text{ bp}=0.4 \\text{ kb}$).\n\nFor a wild-type *synA* allele (no replacement), the expected amplicon length is\n$$\nL_{\\text{WT}}=L_{\\text{synA}}+L_{\\text{flank}}=3.1 \\text{ kb}+0.4 \\text{ kb}=3.5 \\text{ kb}\n$$\nFor a correctly replaced knockout allele (*synA* replaced by *kanR*), the expected amplicon length is\n$$\nL_{\\text{KO}}=L_{\\text{kanR}}+L_{\\text{flank}}=1.5 \\text{ kb}+0.4 \\text{ kb}=1.9 \\text{ kb}\n$$\n\nThe observed gel shows two bands at approximately $3.5 \\text{ kb}$ and $1.9 \\text{ kb}$, which match $L_{\\text{WT}}$ and $L_{\\text{KO}}$, respectively. In a diploid strain, a clonal colony exhibiting both the wild-type-sized and knockout-sized amplicons indicates that one chromosome carries the wild-type *synA* and the other carries the *kanR* replacement, i.e., a heterozygous genotype at the *synA* locus.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A (homozygous wild-type) would yield only the $3.5 \\text{ kb}$ band, not observed.\n- B (homozygous *kanR*) would yield only the $1.9 \\text{ kb}$ band, not observed.\n- C (heterozygous) predicts both $3.5 \\text{ kb}$ and $1.9 \\text{ kb}$ bands, matching the data.\n- D (random integration elsewhere) would leave both *synA* alleles intact at the locus, so primers flanking *synA* would amplify only the $3.5 \\text{ kb}$ product.\n- E (non-clonal mixture) is ruled out by the stated assumption of clonality; additionally, after G418 selection, pure wild-type cells lacking *kanR* would not be expected to contribute to a colony.\n\nTherefore, the best description is that the colony is heterozygous at the *synA* locus, containing one wild-type *synA* allele and one *kanR* replacement allele.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2042181"}]}
