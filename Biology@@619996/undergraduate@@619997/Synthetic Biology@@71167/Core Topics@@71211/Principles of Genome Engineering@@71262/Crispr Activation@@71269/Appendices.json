A catalytically deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) protein fused to a transcriptional activator domain.\n2.  A single guide RNA (sgRNA) designed to direct the dCas9-activator complex to the promoter region of the *TPG1* gene, thereby increasing its transcription.\n\nTo validate their results, the team designs a critical negative control experiment. In this control, they transfect a separate group of cells with a plasmid containing the same dCas9-activator construct but with a \"scrambled\" sgRNA.

A critical control is to separate on-target effects (caused by sequence-specific sgRNA binding at the *TPG1* promoter) from off-target or non-specific effects (caused by the presence of the dCas9-activator and an sgRNA that does not bind any genomic site). A scrambled sgRNA, designed to lack homology to the host genome, will not recruit the complex to any locus, so any change in *TPG1* expression observed in this control reflects non-specific effects due to the presence of the dCas9-activator protein and a non-targeting sgRNA, not sequence-specific activation. Therefore, this control establishes the appropriate background against which the targeted sgRNAâ€™s effect is compared.\n\nOption A captures this purpose directly. Option B (verifying fusion protein synthesis) and Option C (verifying sgRNA transcription/loading) are quality control checks usually addressed by orthogonal assays (e.g., Western blot for protein, northern blot/qPCR for RNA, or RIP), not the primary purpose of the scrambled control. Option D (general plasmid toxicity) is better addressed by empty-vector or vehicle controls and is broader than the specific aim of controlling for dCas9/sgRNA-related non-specific transcriptional changes. Option E (baseline *TPG1* expression without experimental components) corresponds to an untransfected or vehicle-only control, not a scrambled sgRNA control.

The system consists of two plasmids co-transfected into the cells: one expressing a nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9) protein fused to a potent tripartite transcriptional activator domain called VPR (VP64-p65-Rta), and another expressing a single guide RNA (`sgRNA-T`) designed to target the promoter region of *GENE-T*.\n\nAfter 48 hours, the researchers measure the mRNA levels of *GENE-T* using Reverse Transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) but observe no statistically significant increase compared to control cells that did not receive the `sgRNA-T` plasmid. To diagnose the problem, they perform a series of follow-up experiments:\n\n1.  **Activator Expression Check:** A Western blot is performed on lysates from the transfected cells using an antibody that recognizes the VPR domain. The result shows a distinct band at the correct molecular weight for the dCas9-VPR fusion protein, with an intensity comparable to a positive control sample known to work.\n\n2.  **System Functionality Control:** The team co-transfects cells with the same dCas9-VPR plasmid and a different sgRNA plasmid, `sgRNA-P`, which targets the promoter of *GENE-P*. *GENE-P* is a housekeeping gene known to reside in a region of open, accessible chromatin. This experiment results in a significant, 50-fold increase in *GENE-P* mRNA levels.\n\n3.  **Guide RNA Intrinsic Efficacy Test:** An *in vitro* binding assay is conducted. Purified dCas9-VPR protein is mixed with `sgRNA-T` and a short, synthetic, double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide containing the exact target sequence for `sgRNA-T` from the *GENE-T* promoter. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), they observe that the dCas9-VPR/`sgRNA-T` complex efficiently binds to the DNA oligonucleotide target, with a binding affinity in the low nanomolar range, which is considered highly effective.\n\nBased on the results of these three experiments, what is the most likely reason for the failure to activate *GENE-T* in the initial experiment?\n\nA. The dCas9-VPR activator protein was not successfully expressed in the cells.\n\nB. The `sgRNA-T` molecule is intrinsically unable to form a functional complex with the dCas9-VPR protein or to recognize its DNA target sequence.\n\nC. The chromatin structure at the *GENE-T* promoter is in a condensed, inaccessible state, preventing the CRISPRa complex from binding to its target site *in vivo*.\n\nD. The VPR activator domain of the dCas9-VPR fusion protein is non-functional and incapable of recruiting the transcription machinery.", "solution": "We evaluate each hypothesis against the provided experimental evidence using logical elimination.\n\nFirst, consider option A. The Western blot using an anti-VPR antibody shows a distinct band at the correct molecular weight for the dCas9-VPR fusion, with intensity comparable to a known positive control. This directly supports successful expression of the dCas9-VPR protein in cells, arguing against a failure of expression. Therefore, A is not consistent with the data.\n\nNext, consider option D. The system functionality control shows that co-transfection with the same dCas9-VPR plasmid and an alternative sgRNA, `sgRNA-P`, targeting an open-chromatin housekeeping gene promoter, yields a substantial activation (a 50-fold increase in mRNA). This demonstrates that the VPR activator domain is functional for recruiting transcriptional machinery in vivo and that the cellular context supports CRISPRa activity when targeting accessible loci. Therefore, D is not supported.\n\nThen, consider option B. The in vitro EMSA shows that the dCas9-VPR/`sgRNA-T` complex binds its exact DNA target with high affinity in the low nanomolar range, indicating that `sgRNA-T` is capable of forming a functional ribonucleoprotein complex and recognizing its target sequence. This rules out an intrinsic defect in `sgRNA-T`â€™s ability to bind dCas9 or its target DNA. Therefore, B is not supported.\n\nHaving excluded A, B, and D by direct evidence, the remaining explanation is that the CRISPRa complex cannot productively bind the target site in cells due to chromatin context. The lack of activation for *GENE-T* despite proper expression and functionality of dCas9-VPR and intrinsic competence of `sgRNA-T` is most consistent with inaccessible, condensed chromatin at the *GENE-T* promoter that prevents in vivo binding. This matches option C.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason is that the chromatin at the *GENE-T* promoter is condensed and inaccessible, preventing CRISPRa binding and activation in vivo.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2028413"}]}
