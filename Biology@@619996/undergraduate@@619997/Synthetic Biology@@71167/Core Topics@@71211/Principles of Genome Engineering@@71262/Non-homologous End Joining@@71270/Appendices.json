This first exercise provides a concrete example of what this means at the molecular level. By tracing the effects of a small nucleotide insertion, you will see firsthand how an NHEJ repair event can drastically alter a protein's genetic blueprint, a fundamental concept behind its use in gene knockout technologies [@problem_id:2051534].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a researcher is studying the effects of DNA repair mechanisms on a custom-designed gene. The 5' to 3' sequence of the coding strand for the beginning of this gene's first exon is as follows:\n\n`5'-ATG GGC CGA TTT AGC GTC-...-3'`\n\nThe `ATG` codon serves as the start codon, establishing the initial reading frame for translation. During the experiment, a precise double-strand break is induced immediately following the 9th nucleotide from the 5' end. The cell's primary repair pathway, Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), imperfectly repairs this break by inserting a 4-nucleotide sequence, `GCTA`, at the site of the break.\n\nAssuming the provided codon table below, what will be the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein produced from this repaired gene, up until the first stop codon is encountered?\n\n**Codon Table:**\n- `ATG`: Methionine (Met)\n- `GGC`: Glycine (Gly)\n- `CGA`: Arginine (Arg)\n- `TTT`: Phenylalanine (Phe)\n- `AGC`: Serine (Ser)\n- `GCT`: Alanine (Ala)\n- `ATT`: Isoleucine (Ile)\n- `TAG`: Stop\n\n**Choices:**\nA.

Met-Gly-Arg-stop", "solution": "The coding strand is given 5' to 3' as ATG GGC CGA TTT AGC GTC-..., and translation initiates at the start codon ATG, fixing the reading frame as contiguous triplets from the first nucleotide. A double-strand break occurs immediately after the 9th nucleotide (between nucleotides 9 and 10), i.e., between codons 3 and 4 in the original frame, and NHEJ inserts the four-nucleotide sequence GCTA at this junction. Therefore, the repaired sequence at the start becomes ATG GGC CGA GCTA TTT AGC GTC-..., with the reading frame still starting at the original ATG and proceeding in successive triplets.\n\nReading codons from the repaired sequence:\n- The first three codons before the break remain unchanged:\n  - Codon 1: ATG translates to Methionine (Met).\n  - Codon 2: GGC translates to Glycine (Gly).\n  - Codon 3: CGA translates to Arginine (Arg).\n- The insertion contributes the next codons in the established frame:\n  - Codon 4: GCT (first three bases of the insertion) translates to Alanine (Ala).\n  - Codon 5: ATT (last base of the insertion A plus original positions 10 and 11, T and T) translates to Isoleucine (Ile).\n- The next codon from the shifted frame is TAG (original positions 12, 13, 14), which is a stop codon. Thus translation terminates here.\n\nHence, the N-terminal amino acid sequence up to the first stop codon is Met-Gly-Arg-Ala-Ile, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2051534"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a single event to a real-world experiment, this problem challenges you to think like a molecular biologist interpreting raw data. CRISPR-Cas9 induced breaks are repaired by NHEJ heterogeneously across a population of cells, creating a mix of different mutations. This practice will help you recognize the classic experimental signature of NHEJ activity in Sanger sequencing data, a crucial skill for validating gene-editing outcomes [@problem_id:2051571].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to create a gene knockout in a human cell line. The strategy involves targeting the first exon of the gene of interest to introduce a frameshift mutation. The guide RNA (gRNA) is designed to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific site. The DNA sequence of the target region in a wild-type (WT) cell is:\n\nWT Sequence: `5'-AATTGCTAGG CATAGCAGTC GACTGAATAG GCTTACGTAT-3'`\n\nThe Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence is `CGG` (not shown in the provided strand, but located adjacently). The Cas9 nuclease creates a blunt double-strand break (DSB) exactly 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM sequence, which corresponds to the space between nucleotides `C` and `G` in the `...TCG ACT...` part of the sequence. The cut site is therefore `...TC | GACT...`.\n\nAfter transfecting the cells with the CRISPR-Cas9 components, the researcher waits for 72 hours, isolates genomic DNA from the entire population of treated cells, and uses Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify a 200 base pair region centered on the target site. This PCR product is then submitted for Sanger sequencing using a primer that anneals upstream of the target site.\n\nThe sequencing results are as follows:\n- The WT control sample (from untransfected cells) yields a clean, high-quality sequence that perfectly matches the expected WT sequence.\n- The sample from the CRISPR-treated cell population yields a sequence that is clean and perfectly matches the WT sequence up to the nucleotide `C` immediately preceding the cut site (`...TC`). However, starting from the position immediately following the cut site, the sequencing chromatogram becomes unreadable, showing multiple overlapping peaks of roughly equal intensity for all four bases (A, T, C, G) for the remainder of the readable sequence.\n\nBased on this sequencing result from the cell population, which of the following cellular DNA repair processes was most likely the dominant mechanism acting on the Cas9-induced DSBs?\n\n**Choices:**\nA. Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)\n\nB. Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) using a precise repair template provided exogenously\n\nC. Complete failure of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to induce any breaks\n\nD. Error-free repair of the double-strand break, restoring the original wild-type sequence\n\nE. A consistent, large-scale deletion of over 100 base pairs in all edited cells", "solution": "Identify the experimental setup and expected outcomes. The Cas9-gRNA complex induces a blunt double-strand break (DSB) exactly 3 nucleotides upstream of the PAM. Given the provided mapping, the cut occurs at the boundary indicated as $\\dots \\mathrm{TC} \\, | \\, \\mathrm{GACT} \\dots$, i.e., after the cytosine immediately upstream of the break. The researcher amplifies a mixed population of alleles from many cells using PCR and sequences with a primer annealing upstream of the cut site. Sanger sequencing of a mixed amplicon pool yields a superposition of signals from all alleles present; positions where all templates are identical yield clean peaks, whereas positions where the pool contains heterogeneous sequences yield overlapping peaks.\n\nDeduce what each repair mechanism would produce in the Sanger trace:\n1. If there were complete failure to cut or perfectly error-free repair restoring the wild type, the entire chromatogram would remain clean and match the wild-type sequence throughout, not just up to the cut site. Therefore, both “no cut” and “error-free repair” predict a uniformly clean WT trace from start to finish, which contradicts the observed unreadable mixture starting precisely at the cut site.\n2. If HDR using a precise exogenous template were the dominant pathway, the majority of templates would be identically modified according to the donor sequence. This would yield a clean chromatogram matching the donor (or a clean, systematic change) starting at or near the cut site, not a mixed set of overlapping peaks of roughly equal intensity for all four bases.\n3. If there were a consistent, large-scale deletion over approximately $10^{2}$ base pairs in all edited cells, then either the PCR would fail (if a primer site were deleted), or, if the amplicon were still produced, the Sanger read would shift uniformly after the breakpoint, producing a clean but altered sequence (e.g., shorter read or a clean junction), not a heterogeneous superposition. A uniform large deletion does not produce pervasive base ambiguity across the population; it produces a consistent, clean alternative sequence.\n\nRelate the observation to Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ). NHEJ is the predominant DSB repair pathway in human cells in the absence of a homologous template. It frequently introduces small insertions and deletions (indels) at the break site. In a pooled sample:\n- Upstream of the cut site, all alleles are identical to WT because repair-induced indels occur at or downstream of the cleavage site. Thus the chromatogram is clean and matches WT to the nucleotide immediately before the cut.\n- Immediately after the cut, different alleles carry different indels (varied sizes and sequences), causing the Sanger sequencing reaction to superimpose signals from many divergent templates. This yields overlapping peaks of similar intensity for all four bases, starting exactly at the first base after the break.\n\nTherefore, the specific pattern—clean WT sequence until the cut site, followed by unreadable, multi-peak signal for the remainder—most strongly indicates heterogeneous indels created by NHEJ acting on the Cas9-induced DSBs across the cell population.\n\nConclude that the dominant repair process is Non-Homologous End Joining.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2051571"}, {"introduction": "The \"errors\" of NHEJ are not just random noise; they follow predictable patterns that can be harnessed for synthetic biology. This problem demonstrates how to turn this feature into a design tool by creating a reporter system that is activated by NHEJ. You will apply basic probability and an understanding of the genetic code to calculate the likelihood of a successful frameshift correction, showcasing how we can engineer with cellular repair machinery [@problem_id:2051581].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is designing a genetic construct to act as a reporter for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair events. The construct consists of a strong, constitutive promoter followed by the coding sequence for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). However, to ensure the GFP is not expressed initially, a single extra thymine (T) nucleotide has been intentionally inserted between the start codon (ATG) and the main body of the GFP coding sequence. This insertion creates a frameshift mutation, preventing the synthesis of a functional protein.\n\nTo activate the reporter, a CRISPR-Cas9 system is used to introduce a precise DSB immediately adjacent to this inserted thymine nucleotide. The cell's native Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) repair machinery then repairs the break. The repair process is imperfect and can result in small insertions or deletions (indels) at the repair site. A detailed analysis of the specific sequence context and cellular environment has yielded the following discrete probability distribution for the outcomes of a single NHEJ repair event:\n\n*   Perfect re-ligation (0 base pair change): 12%\n*   Deletion of 1 base pair: 35%\n*   Insertion of 1 base pair: 24%\n*   Deletion of 2 base pairs: 13%\n*   Insertion of 2 base pairs: 9%\n*   Deletion of 3 base pairs: 4%\n*   Insertion of 3 base pairs: 3%\n\nAssume that any repair event which restores the correct reading frame for the GFP coding sequence results in the production of functional, fluorescent protein, and that any other outcome results in no fluorescence.

Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Let the initial frameshift introduced by the extra nucleotide be represented as an offset $s=+1$ relative to the correct frame. Let $r$ denote the net change in nucleotides introduced by the NHEJ repair event, with insertions counted positive and deletions counted negative.\n\nThe final reading frame offset after repair is $s+r$ (in nucleotides). For the GFP coding sequence to be in-frame, the total offset must be a multiple of $3$:\n$$\ns + r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.\n$$\nWith $s=1$, this requires\n$$\nr \\equiv -1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}.\n$$\n\nFrom the given outcomes, the possible $r$ values are $0, -1, +1, -2, +2, -3, +3$. The values satisfying $r \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ are $r=-1$ (deletion of 1 bp) and $r=+2$ (insertion of 2 bp).\n\nTherefore, the total probability of restoring the correct reading frame is the sum of the probabilities of these two outcomes:\n$$\nP(\\text{functional GFP}) = 0.35 + 0.09 = 0.44.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.44}$$", "id": "2051581"}]}
