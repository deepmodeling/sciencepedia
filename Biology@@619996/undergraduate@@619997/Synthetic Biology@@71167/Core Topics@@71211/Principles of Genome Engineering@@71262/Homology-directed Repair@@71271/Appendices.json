{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Success in science often comes from understanding failure. This first practice problem presents a common scenario in gene editing: the experiment produced evidence of DNA cutting but failed to achieve the desired insertion. By analyzing the results, you can deduce which component of the CRISPR-Cas9 system—the nuclease, the guide RNA, or the donor template—was the likely culprit, honing your skills in experimental troubleshooting.", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is attempting to tag an endogenous protein, which we will call \"Kinase Z\", with a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) in a line of cultured human cells. Their goal is to visualize the subcellular localization of Kinase Z.\n\nTo achieve this, they utilize the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system. The system has three key components delivered to the cells:\n1.  The **Cas9 nuclease**, an enzyme that cuts DNA.\n2.  A **guide RNA (gRNA)**, a small RNA molecule designed to be complementary to a specific 20-nucleotide sequence in the genome, thereby directing the Cas9 nuclease to that location.\n3.  A **donor template**, which is a linear double-stranded DNA molecule containing the sequence for RFP, flanked on both sides by \"homology arms\"—sequences of several hundred nucleotides that are identical to the genomic DNA sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the intended cut site.\n\nThe team's gRNA is designed to direct Cas9 to create a Double-Strand Break (DSB) just before the stop codon of the gene encoding Kinase Z. The cell's natural DNA repair machinery then resolves this break. There are two primary competing pathways for this repair:\n- **Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ):** The cell's default, rapid repair mechanism. It directly ligates the broken DNA ends, but is error-prone and frequently introduces small random insertions or deletions, collectively known as \"indels\".\n- **Homology-Directed Repair (HDR):** A more precise, but less frequent, pathway that uses a homologous DNA sequence as a template to accurately repair the break. The experiment is designed for the cell to use the provided donor template for HDR, thereby integrating the RFP sequence into the Kinase Z gene.\n\nAfter performing the experiment, the team isolates genomic DNA from the cell population and sequences the region around the targeted locus in the Kinase Z gene. The analysis shows that a high percentage of the cells contain indels at the precise location targeted by the gRNA. However, after extensive screening, they find zero cells in which the RFP sequence has been successfully integrated.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following is the most probable cause for the failure to generate RFP-tagged Kinase Z?\n\nA. The Cas9 nuclease was inactive and failed to create any double-strand breaks.\n\nB. The gRNA sequence did not match the target site in the Kinase Z gene, preventing Cas9 from binding.\n\nC. The donor template was improperly designed or was not available to the cell's repair machinery.\n\nD. The cell's Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) repair pathway was completely non-functional.\n\nE. The experiment was performed on cells that were not actively dividing.", "solution": "The observation that a high fraction of the sequenced alleles carry indels precisely at the gRNA-targeted site establishes that Cas9-induced double-strand breaks occurred at the intended locus and that repair proceeded predominantly via the error-prone Non-Homologous End Joining pathway. From this, it follows directly that the Cas9 nuclease was active and that the gRNA directed Cas9 to the correct genomic site, because indels localized to the target site are the hallmark of on-target cutting followed by NHEJ. Therefore, options A and B are incompatible with the data.\n\nThe presence of many NHEJ-generated indels also demonstrates that the NHEJ pathway was functioning. If the NHEJ pathway were completely non-functional, one would not expect a high frequency of indels generated by end joining at the break site; instead, cells would either rely on alternative, typically lethal or low-efficiency repair routes or demonstrate different outcomes. Thus, option D is contradicted by the observed repair profile.\n\nThe specific failure noted is the absence of any detectable Homology-Directed Repair-mediated knock-in of the RFP cassette despite frequent cutting. When on-target DSBs are frequent but HDR-mediated integration is absent, the most parsimonious explanation is that the HDR template could not be used by the cell, either because it was not present in the nucleus at the time of repair or because its design precluded productive homologous recombination. Typical donor template issues include incorrectly matched homology arms (sequence mismatches relative to the targeted locus), insufficient homology arm length, incorrect strand topology or format for the chosen delivery method, or inclusion of features that prevent proper recombination or lead to recutting without adequate PAM or seed-region mutation in the donor. Any of these would force the cell to resolve the DSBs predominantly by NHEJ, yielding the observed high frequency of indels and zero integrations.\n\nAlthough HDR is cell-cycle dependent and enhanced in S/G2, and non-dividing cells exhibit very low HDR efficiency, the experiment was conducted in a line of cultured human cells, which are typically proliferative unless specifically rendered quiescent. Moreover, even in suboptimal HDR conditions, rare knock-ins are often detectable when cutting is robust. Given that cutting clearly occurred and that absolutely no HDR events were recovered despite extensive screening, a donor template problem is the most probable and direct cause. Therefore, option E is less likely than a donor template design or availability failure.\n\nConsequently, the most probable cause is that the donor template was improperly designed or unavailable to the repair machinery.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2042496"}, {"introduction": "Once a gene editing experiment is complete, the next challenge is to identify the cells that contain the correct modification. This exercise asks you to design a practical and efficient laboratory workflow to screen for different genetic outcomes. Developing a robust screening strategy using common molecular biology techniques is a critical skill for any synthetic biologist working with genome engineering.", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to engineer a specific cell line. Their goal is to introduce a functional knockout of Gene `XYZ` by inserting a small DNA sequence at a precise location within the gene's coding region. They are using a donor DNA template for Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) that, if successfully integrated, will insert a 6 base pair (bp) sequence. This specific 6 bp sequence contains two key features: a premature stop codon to truncate the protein and a unique recognition site for the restriction enzyme EcoRI (`GAATTC`). The wild-type (WT) version of Gene `XYZ` does not contain an EcoRI recognition site anywhere in the amplified region.\n\nAfter performing the gene editing experiment, the scientists isolate individual cell clones to screen for the genetic outcome at the target locus. They know three outcomes are possible for any given allele:\n1.  **Wild-Type (WT):** The gene remains unedited.\n2.  **HDR:** The desired 6 bp sequence was correctly inserted via Homology-Directed Repair.\n3.  **NHEJ:** The DNA double-strand break was repaired by Non-Homologous End Joining, resulting in small, unpredictable insertions or deletions (collectively known as indels) at the cut site.\n\nThe team designs a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay to screen the clones. They use a pair of primers, Forward Primer (F1) and Reverse Primer (R1), that flank the target site. Amplification of the WT allele with these primers yields a PCR product of exactly 300 bp.\n\nWhich of the following screening strategies would most effectively and unambiguously distinguish between all three possible outcomes (WT, successful HDR, and NHEJ-induced indel) in a given clonal cell line?\n\nA. Amplify the target region using primers F1 and R1 and analyze the product size on an agarose gel. A product of 306 bp indicates a successful HDR event, while a product of 300 bp indicates a WT or NHEJ event.\n\nB. Design a new forward primer, F2, that binds specifically within the 6 bp inserted sequence. Perform PCR using the primer pair F2 and R1. The presence of a PCR product indicates a successful HDR event, while its absence indicates a WT or NHEJ event.\n\nC. Amplify the target region using primers F1 and R1, then digest the resulting PCR product with the EcoRI enzyme. Analyze the result on an agarose gel. An uncut product indicates a WT or NHEJ event, while a product cut into two smaller fragments indicates a successful HDR event.\n\nD. Amplify the target region using primers F1 and R1. First, analyze the product size on a high-resolution agarose gel. Then, take the same PCR product and digest it with the EcoRI enzyme, and analyze the digest products on a second gel. The combination of results from both analyses is used to determine the outcome.\n\nE. Amplify the target region using primers F1 and R1. Sequence the entire 300-306 bp PCR product from every clone using Sanger sequencing.", "solution": "The experimental design yields the following expectations for the F1/R1 PCR amplicon:\n- WT allele: exactly 300 bp, with no EcoRI site anywhere in the amplicon.\n- HDR allele: exactly 306 bp because of a 6 bp insertion that includes an EcoRI site; this amplicon is therefore digestible by EcoRI into two predictable fragments whose sizes sum to 306 bp.\n- NHEJ allele: an indel of unpredictable size around the cut site; the amplicon length can be less than, greater than, or conceivably equal to 300 bp, and no designed EcoRI site is expected. A coincidental 6 bp insertion could yield a 306 bp product that lacks the EcoRI site, and random sequence changes could in rare cases create an EcoRI site at an unpredictable position.\n\nEvaluate each strategy:\n\nA. Size analysis alone cannot unambiguously separate HDR from NHEJ, because an NHEJ event can produce a 306 bp product (for example, a 6 bp insertion) that lacks the EcoRI site. Likewise, a 300 bp band could be WT or an NHEJ event whose net size change is not resolved. Therefore, A is ambiguous.\n\nB. A primer entirely within the 6 bp insert is not a practical PCR primer. Even if one attempted a junction-specific primer, this assay would only indicate the presence of HDR, not distinguish WT from NHEJ. Therefore, B is ambiguous for WT versus NHEJ and is technically flawed as stated.\n\nC. EcoRI digestion of the F1/R1 amplicon identifies HDR (cut) versus non-HDR (uncut), but it cannot distinguish WT from NHEJ, both of which would generally yield an uncut product. Therefore, C is ambiguous for WT versus NHEJ.\n\nD. Combining high-resolution size analysis with EcoRI digestion resolves all three outcomes:\n- If the product is 306 bp and EcoRI cuts it into two fragments, this indicates HDR.\n- If the product is exactly 300 bp and remains uncut by EcoRI, this indicates WT.\n- If the product size differs from 300 bp and 306 bp and remains uncut by EcoRI, this indicates NHEJ.\nAdditionally, if a 306 bp product is uncut, it indicates an NHEJ-induced 6 bp insertion lacking the EcoRI site, thus distinguishing it from HDR. If EcoRI cutting appears but the fragment sizes do not match the expected HDR pattern, that would indicate a non-HDR EcoRI site generated by NHEJ, which remains distinguishable by the discordant size and digest pattern. Thus, D is an effective screening strategy that unambiguously distinguishes WT, HDR, and NHEJ.\n\nE. Sanger sequencing of every amplicon is indeed unambiguous and definitive, but it is not an efficient screening strategy. The prompt asks for the most effective screening strategy that unambiguously distinguishes the outcomes; among the screening options, D achieves this with high specificity and practicality.\n\nTherefore, D is the best choice among the listed screening strategies to effectively and unambiguously distinguish WT, HDR, and NHEJ in clonal lines.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2042462"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying individual edited clones, it is crucial to assess the overall performance of a gene editing experiment across a whole cell population.
