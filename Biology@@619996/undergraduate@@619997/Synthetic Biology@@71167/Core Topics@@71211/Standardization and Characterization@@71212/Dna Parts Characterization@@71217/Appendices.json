The full-length version of this promoter is 110 base pairs (bp) long, encompassing the sequence from position -110 to -1 relative to the experimentally determined Transcription Start Site (TSS) at +1.\n\nTo identify the minimal DNA sequence required for its function, the team performs a 5' deletion analysis. They generate a series of plasmids, each containing a progressively shorter version of the `P_forte` promoter placed upstream of a gene encoding the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). A plasmid lacking any promoter sequence before the GFP gene is used as a negative control. Each of these plasmids is transformed into *Escherichia coli*, and the resulting promoter activity is quantified by measuring the whole-cell fluorescence, reported in Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU).\n\nThe results of the experiment are summarized in the table below:\n\n| Construct | Promoter Fragment Included | Mean RFU |\n| :-------: | :------------------------: | :------: |\n|     1     |      -110 bp to -1 bp      |   2150   |\n|     2     |      -95 bp to -1 bp       |   2135   |\n|     3     |      -70 bp to -1 bp       |   2160   |\n|     4     |      -50 bp to -1 bp       |   2145   |\n|     5     |      -38 bp to -1 bp       |   125    |\n|     6     |      -25 bp to -1 bp       |   121    |\n|  Control  |        No Promoter         |   120    |\n\nBased on the data from this deletion analysis, which of the following represents the smallest DNA fragment that retains the core functional activity of the `P_forte` promoter?\n\nA.

The control has RFU of 120, so constructs with RFU near 120 indicate no promoter activity, whereas constructs with RFU around 2100 indicate full promoter activity.\n\nConstructs 1 through 4, spanning from -110 to -1, -95 to -1, -70 to -1, and -50 to -1, respectively, all show high RFU values (2150, 2135, 2160, 2145), statistically similar and indicating that sequences upstream of -50 are dispensable for activity. Constructs 5 and 6, spanning -38 to -1 and -25 to -1, show RFU values (125, 121) indistinguishable from the control (120), indicating loss of promoter function when the deletion extends beyond -50.\n\nTherefore:\n- The deletion boundary at -50 retains activity, while deletion to -38 abolishes it. This implies that an essential promoter element required for core function lies between -50 and -38.\n- The smallest tested fragment that retains full promoter activity must include the region from -50 to -1, since any further truncation to start at -38 eliminates activity.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A (-110 to -1) retains activity but is not minimal.\n- B (-70 to -38) is internal and does not include the TSS-proximal region; it was not tested in that configuration and would omit the required downstream elements.\n- C (-50 to -1) is exactly the minimal fragment demonstrated to retain activity by the data.\n- D (-50 to -38) is only a short internal segment and, by itself, would not be sufficient to drive transcription.\n- E (-38 to -1) matches the nonfunctional construct 5.\n\nThus, the smallest fragment that retains the core functional activity is from -50 to -1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2032456"}, {"introduction": "After identifying a functional part, the next step is to quantify its performance characteristics.

To quantify its performance, they created a test construct where `pLux` drives the expression of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter gene.\n\nThe team prepared three parallel cultures of *E. coli* bacteria:\n1.  **Uninduced Culture:** Cells with the `pLux-gfp` construct, grown without AHL to measure basal (\"leaky\") expression.\n2.  **Induced Culture:** Cells with the `pLux-gfp` construct, grown with a saturating concentration of AHL to measure maximal expression.\n3.  **Control Culture:** Cells without the `pLux-gfp` construct, to measure the background autofluorescence of the cells and media.\n\nAfter incubation, the team measured the total fluorescence (in arbitrary fluorescence units, AFU) and the cell density (as optical density at 600 nm, OD600) for each culture. The data are as follows:\n\n*   **Uninduced Culture:** Fluorescence = 18,500 AFU; OD600 = 0.55\n*   **Induced Culture:** Fluorescence = 976,000 AFU; OD600 = 0.51\n*   **Control Culture:** Fluorescence = 4,100 AFU; OD600 = 0.53\n\nTo accurately quantify the GFP expression, the raw measurements must be processed. First, for each culture, a normalized fluorescence value is calculated by dividing its total fluorescence by its OD600. This accounts for differences in cell density. Second, to isolate the signal from GFP alone, the normalized fluorescence of the control culture is subtracted from the normalized fluorescence of both the uninduced and induced cultures.

By analyzing diagnostic data from a colony Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), you will develop the critical thinking skills needed to deduce the underlying cause of a circuit failure, a core competency for any synthetic biologist.", "problem": "A synthetic biology student is designing a genetic circuit in *E. coli* intended to characterize the relative translation initiation efficiency of two different Ribosome Binding Sites (RBSs). The circuit is constructed on a single high-copy plasmid and comprises two reporter cassettes placed in tandem. The first cassette uses Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and the second uses Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP). The design aims to have both reporters expressed from identical constitutive promoters, `P_const`, to ensure equal transcription initiation rates. The intended genetic architecture, from upstream to downstream, is:\n\n`P_const` - `RBS_A` - `GFP` - `T_A` - `P_const` - `RBS_B` - `RFP` - `T_B`\n\nThe lengths of the individual genetic parts are as follows:\n-   `P_const` promoter: 55 base pairs (bp)\n-   `RBS_A`: 20 bp\n-   `GFP` coding sequence: 720 bp\n-   `T_A` terminator: 110 bp\n-   `RBS_B`: 12 bp\n-   `RFP` coding sequence: 675 bp\n-   `T_B` terminator: 90 bp\n\nAfter transforming *E. coli* with the assembled plasmid, the student observes that all resulting colonies are bright red under appropriate illumination, but none exhibit any green fluorescence. This suggests a systemic failure in the expression of GFP.\n\nTo investigate the genetic integrity of the construct, the student performs colony Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). A forward primer is designed to anneal to the plasmid backbone 30 bp upstream of the first `P_const` promoter, and a reverse primer is designed to anneal 60 bp downstream of the `T_B` terminator. Upon analyzing the PCR products via agarose gel electrophoresis, a single, sharp band is observed for all tested colonies, corresponding to a DNA fragment size of approximately 920 bp.\n\nBased on these results, what is the most plausible explanation for the absence of GFP expression?\n\nA. The observed PCR band size of ~920 bp is an experimental artifact, and the real issue is likely a point mutation in the `GFP` start codon, which would abolish translation but not be detectable by gel electrophoresis.\n\nB. A large-scale deletion has occurred due to homologous recombination between the two identical `P_const` promoters, leading to the excision of the intervening `RBS_A` - `GFP` - `T_A` cassette.\n\nC. The expression of RFP is metabolically burdensome, causing the host cell to selectively silence the expression of the upstream `GFP` gene through epigenetic modifications. This does not affect the DNA sequence.\n\nD. The `T_A` terminator is faulty, leading to transcriptional read-through into the second cassette. This interferes with `GFP` translation but does not explain the observed PCR product size.\n\nE. The entire plasmid was lost from the cells, and the observed PCR band is a result of non-specific amplification of a segment of the *E. coli* genome that coincidentally has a size of ~920 bp.\n\nF. The observed size of ~920 bp corresponds to the intended full-length construct, indicating the problem lies with protein folding or maturation, not the genetic sequence.", "solution": "Define the lengths of all parts as follows: let $L_{P}$ be the promoter length, $L_{\\text{RBSA}}$ the length of $\\text{RBS\\_A}$, $L_{\\text{GFP}}$ the GFP coding sequence length, $L_{T_{A}}$ the terminator $T_{A}$ length, $L_{\\text{RBSB}}$ the length of $\\text{RBS\\_B}$, $L_{\\text{RFP}}$ the RFP coding sequence length, and $L_{T_{B}}$ the terminator $T_{B}$ length.

Thus, the band cannot correspond to the intact intended region, so option F is incompatible with the size calculation. A point mutation in the GFP start codon (option A) would not change the amplicon size and cannot explain a reduction from $1827$ bp to about $920$ bp. A faulty terminator (option D) affects transcriptional read-through, not PCR size. Loss of the plasmid (option E) is inconsistent with uniform, specific bands across colonies and with robust RFP fluorescence, which requires the plasmid. Epigenetic silencing in bacteria (option C) would not yield a specific size reduction in the PCR product.\n\nConsider homologous recombination between the two identical $P_{\\text{const}}$ promoters. Two direct repeats can recombine to delete the intervening sequence, leaving a single copy of the repeat. Here, recombination between the two identical promoters would excise the entire intervening region $RBS\\_A$–GFP–$T_{A}$ and collapse the two promoters into one. The resulting sequence between primers would then include only a single promoter followed by $RBS\\_B$–RFP–$T_{B}$.
