The standard method for this characterization involves measuring the expression of a fluorescent reporter protein. The strength is quantified using Relative Promoter Units (RPU), defined as the ratio of the activity of the test promoter to the activity of the standard promoter.\n\nThe activity of a promoter, denoted by $\\alpha$, is defined as the steady-state production rate of the protein it expresses. The measured steady-state fluorescence, $F_{ss}$, from a reporter construct is directly proportional to the promoter's activity and a reporter-specific constant, $C_{reporter}$, which accounts for the reporter protein's intrinsic properties like brightness and stability. Thus, the relationship can be modeled as $F_{ss} = k \\cdot \\alpha \\cdot C_{reporter}$, where $k$ is a measurement-specific proportionality constant.\n\nThe researcher conducts the following experiments:\n1.  A standard construct, where promoter $P_{std}$ drives the expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), is introduced into a cell culture. The measured steady-state fluorescence is $F_{std, GFP}$.\n2.  A test construct, where promoter $P_{test}$ drives the expression of mCherry (a red fluorescent protein), is used in a separate culture.
