This construct consists of a strong constitutive promoter followed by the terminator sequence in question, and then a reporter gene. The activity of the reporter gene is directly proportional to the number of RNA polymerase molecules that \"read through\" the terminator, failing to terminate transcription.\n\nThrough a high-precision RNA sequencing analysis of a large cell population, it is determined that for every 200 transcripts that are initiated at the promoter, exactly 1 transcript successfully reads through the terminator and is fully transcribed.\n\nThe efficiency of a terminator is defined as the fraction of all initiated transcription events that are successfully halted by the terminator sequence.\n\nCalculate the efficiency of this terminator.

Instead, synthetic biologists rely on reporter genes, whose measurable output serves as a proxy for transcriptional activity. This practice problem introduces the classic dual-reporter assay, a cornerstone method for characterizing parts like terminators [@problem_id:2074152]. You will calculate efficiency by relating the fluorescence levels of an upstream reporter, which measures total transcription, to a downstream reporter, which measures transcriptional readthrough.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a researcher aims to quantify the effectiveness of a newly designed transcriptional terminator. To do this, they construct a test plasmid containing a dual-reporter system. The genetic construct is arranged as follows: a strong constitutive promoter, a gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), the terminator sequence to be tested, and finally a gene encoding Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP). The plasmid is then transformed into a suitable bacterial host.\n\nThe operational principle is that transcription initiated at the promoter will always produce GFP. If the terminator is effective, transcription will stop before reaching the RFP gene. If the terminator is \"leaky\" or inefficient, some transcripts will continue past it, resulting in the production of RFP. For this system, it can be assumed that the measured fluorescence intensity of each protein is directly proportional to its rate of synthesis, and that both reporter proteins have similar maturation and degradation kinetics.\n\nAfter a period of growth and expression, the cell culture is analyzed using a fluorometer. The fluorescence intensity attributable to GFP is measured to be 1250 arbitrary units, while the fluorescence intensity from RFP is measured to be 68 arbitrary units.\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the termination efficiency of the new terminator.

With fluorescence intensities proportional to synthesis rates and similar maturation/degradation kinetics for both reporters, the fraction of transcripts that read through the terminator equals the ratio of RFP to GFP fluorescence. Let $I_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{RFP}}$ denote the measured fluorescence intensities. Then the read-through fraction is $\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{RFP}}}{I_{\\mathrm{GFP}}}$, and the termination efficiency is the complement:\n$$\\eta=1-\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{RFP}}}{I_{\\mathrm{GFP}}}.$$\nSubstituting the given values $I_{\\mathrm{GFP}}=1250$ and $I_{\\mathrm{RFP}}=68$,\n$$\\eta=1-\\frac{68}{1250}=1-0.0544=0.9456.$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $0.946$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.946}$$", "id": "2074152"}, {"introduction": "While reporter proteins are invaluable, their ultimate expression levels can be affected by factors beyond transcription, such as translation efficiency and protein stability. To obtain a more direct measure of transcriptional activity, modern methods like RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to quantify transcript abundance directly.

From the RNA-seq data, they determined the total number of sequence reads that mapped to three distinct regions of the plasmid and the length of each region in base pairs (bp).\n\nThe three regions are defined as follows:\n- **Region 1**: A 500 bp non-coding region on the plasmid, located far away from any known promoters or genes.
