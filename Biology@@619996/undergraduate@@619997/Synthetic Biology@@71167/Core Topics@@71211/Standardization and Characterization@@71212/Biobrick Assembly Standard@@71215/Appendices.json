This part is intended to be compatible with the BioBrick assembly standard, a common framework for assembling Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments. A key requirement of the BioBrick standard is that the DNA sequence of a part must not contain the recognition sites for the restriction enzymes used in the assembly process. One such forbidden site is for the enzyme EcoRI, which recognizes the sequence 5'-GAATTC-3'.\n\nThe coding sequence (CDS) for the new protein part contains the following segment, shown 5' to 3'. The translation of this segment begins at the first nucleotide shown, which corresponds to the start of a codon.\n\nSequence (5' to 3'): ATG CTA GGT GAA TTC GCA TGA\n\nTo render the part compatible, a researcher must introduce a single point mutation that eliminates the EcoRI site without altering the amino acid sequence of the translated protein (a silent mutation).

Inspecting the sequence, positions 10–15 are GAA TTC, which exactly matches GAATTC. Therefore, to remove the EcoRI site while preserving the amino acid sequence (a silent mutation), we must alter one nucleotide within positions 10–15 in a way that:\n1) breaks the motif GAATTC, and\n2) does not change the encoded amino acid for its codon.\n\nUsing the standard RNA codon table (with DNA coding strand mapped to RNA by replacing T with U):\n- ATG corresponds to AUG (Met)\n- CTA corresponds to CUA (Leu)\n- GGT corresponds to GGU (Gly)\n- GAA corresponds to GAA (Glu)\n- TTC corresponds to UUC (Phe)\n- GCA corresponds to GCA (Ala)\n- TGA corresponds to UGA (Stop)\n\nThus, codon 4 (positions 10–12) is GAA encoding Glu, and codon 5 (positions 13–15) is TTC encoding Phe. The degeneracy for these amino acids is:\n- Glu: GAA or GAG\n- Phe: TTT or TTC (in RNA: UUU or UUC)\n\nTherefore, the only single-nucleotide silent changes available within positions 10–15 are:\n- Change position 12 from A to G to convert GAA to GAG (Glu remains Glu), or\n- Change position 15 from C to T to convert TTC to TTT (Phe remains Phe).\n\nWe now evaluate the proposed options:\n\nA. Position 12 A to G: This changes GAA to GAG (Glu to Glu, silent) and converts GAATTC to GAGTTC, which is no longer the EcoRI site. This satisfies both requirements.\n\nB. Position 14 T to C: Codon TTC becomes TCC (Phe to Ser), which is not silent. Reject.\n\nC. Position 11 A to C: Codon GAA becomes GCA (Glu to Ala), which is not silent. Reject.\n\nD. Position 10 G to A: Codon GAA becomes AAA (Glu to Lys), which is not silent. Reject.\n\nE. Position 15 C to A: Codon TTC becomes TTA (Phe to Leu), which is not silent.

The design requires assembling two standard BioBrick compatible parts in a specific order: Part A, which is a promoter, and Part B, which contains a Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) and the gene for the fluorescent protein. The final goal is to create a single composite part, `[Part A]-[Part B]`, within a destination plasmid.\n\nThe multipart assembly standard being used (BioBrick RFC10) has the following rules:\n1.  Each biological part is flanked by a standard prefix sequence on its 5' end and a standard suffix sequence on its 3' end.\n2.  The prefix contains restriction enzyme sites for EcoRI and XbaI, in that order, as one moves from the plasmid backbone towards the part. The full sequence of sites in the prefix is 5'-EcoRI-NotI-XbaI-3'.\n3.  The suffix contains restriction enzyme sites for SpeI and PstI, in that order, as one moves away from the part towards the plasmid backbone. The full sequence of sites in the suffix is 5'-SpeI-NotI-PstI-3'.\n4.  A key feature for assembly is that the enzymes XbaI and SpeI produce compatible \"sticky ends\". When these ends are ligated together, they form a \"scar\" sequence that is no longer recognized by either XbaI or SpeI.\n5.  All standard BioBrick parts, like Part A and Part B, are specifically engineered to not contain any of the four key assembly restriction sites (EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI) within their own sequences.\n\nTo create the composite `[Part A]-[Part B]` construct, the student must digest the shipping plasmid containing Part A, the shipping plasmid containing Part B, and the destination plasmid with appropriate enzymes, and then ligate the desired fragments together in a single reaction.\n\nTo prepare Part A to serve as the upstream component in this assembly (i.e., the first part in the `[Part A]-[Part B]` construct), which pair of restriction enzymes should the student use to digest the shipping plasmid that contains Part A?\n\nA.

The assembly strategy to create the composite construct $[ \\text{Part A} ]-[ \\text{Part B} ]$ relies on the fact that XbaI and SpeI produce compatible overhangs that ligate to form a scar sequence that is no longer cut by either enzyme. In the canonical two-part assembly, the destination plasmid is opened with EcoRI and PstI to accept an upstream fragment at EcoRI and a downstream fragment at PstI. To place Part A upstream, it must retain an EcoRI-compatible end at its 5' side to ligate into the vector at EcoRI and present a SpeI end at its 3' side to ligate to the XbaI end of Part B, creating the scar. Therefore, Part A should be excised from its shipping plasmid with EcoRI at the 5' end and SpeI at the 3' end, yielding a fragment with EcoRI and SpeI sticky ends appropriate for upstream insertion and junction formation with Part B’s XbaI end. The alternative enzyme pairs do not satisfy these requirements: EcoRI and PstI would place a PstI end at the 3' side, which is intended for the downstream junction with the vector rather than for forming the scar with Part B; XbaI and PstI would not provide an EcoRI end for insertion at the 5' vector site; XbaI and SpeI produce compatible ends on both sides but do not match the EcoRI/PstI vector ends for directional cloning.
