The goal is to ligate two separate DNA parts, Part A and Part B, such that Part A is positioned upstream of Part B.\n\nThe relevant DNA sequences for the assembly are as follows:\n- The 3' end of the coding sequence of Part A is followed by a standard BioBrick suffix sequence. The junction region on the coding strand (5' to 3') is: `...[end of Part A coding sequence]... A ACTAGT A...`\n- The 5' end of the coding sequence of Part B is preceded by a standard BioBrick prefix sequence. The junction region on the coding strand (5' to 3') is: `...T TCTAGA G ...[start of Part B coding sequence]...`\n\nThe assembly process involves using two specific restriction enzymes with the following properties:\n- **XbaI**: Recognizes the sequence `TCTAGA` and cuts the DNA after the first Thymine, as indicated by the apostrophe: `5'-T'CTAGA-3'`.\n- **SpeI**: Recognizes the sequence `ACTAGT` and cuts the DNA after the first Adenine: `5'-A'CTAGT-3'`.\n\nTo achieve the desired `Part A - Part B` orientation, the plasmid containing Part A is digested with SpeI, and the plasmid containing Part B is digested with XbaI. The correct fragments are then purified and joined together using DNA ligase. This process creates a \"scar\"—a short, mixed DNA sequence at the junction that is no longer recognized by either XbaI or SpeI.\n\nWhat is the 6-base-pair sequence of this scar on the coding (5' to 3') strand, located between the flanking `A` from the suffix and `G` from the prefix?\n\nA. `ACTAGA`\n\nB. `ACTAGG`\n\nC. `TCTAGT`\n\nD. `TACTAG`\n\nE. `CTAGTC`", "solution": "The BioBrick RFC 10 assembly uses SpeI and XbaI, which generate compatible 5' overhangs and, upon ligation, create a mixed sequence (“scar”) that is no longer recognized by either enzyme.\n\n1) Identify recognition and cut sites:\n- SpeI recognizes ACTAGT and cuts as 5'-A'CTAGT-3', i.e., between the first A (call this s1) and C (s2). This generates a 4-nt 5' overhang CTAG on the top strand (positions s2–s5).\n- XbaI recognizes TCTAGA and cuts as 5'-T'C TAGA-3', i.e., between the first T (x1) and C (x2). This also generates a 4-nt 5' overhang CTAG on the top strand (positions x2–x5).\n\n2) Use the provided sequence contexts:\n- Suffix region around SpeI on the coding strand (5' to 3'): ... A ACTAGT A ...\n  Here, the flanking base before the site is A (call it fA0), the site bases are s1–s6 = A C T A G T, and the flanking base after the site is A (fA1).\n- Prefix region around XbaI on the coding strand (5' to 3'): ...

After ligation, the continuous top-strand sequence across the junction consists of:\n  - The base immediately upstream of the overhang from the SpeI side: s1 = A.\n  - The annealed overhang bases: CTAG (either source, they are identical).\n  - The base immediately downstream of the overhang from the XbaI side: x6 = A.\n  Therefore, the six-base scar on the top (coding) strand is A CTAG A, i.e., ACTAGA.\n\n5) Placement relative to flanking bases:\n- The problem asks for the 6-bp scar located between the flanking A from the suffix and G from the prefix. The final junction context is thus:\n  ... fA0 (A) [scar = ACTAGA] fB1 (G) ...\n  The scar ACTAGA is not recognized by SpeI (requires ACTAGT) or XbaI (requires TCTAGA), as the terminal bases differ.\n\nTherefore, the correct 6-bp scar sequence is ACTAGA, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2070071"}, {"introduction": "Building biological systems often involves troubleshooting unexpected results. This problem simulates a common laboratory error—incorrectly orienting a part—to test your understanding of the fundamental \"rules\" of genetic circuit construction [@problem_id:2070086]. By predicting the outcome of inserting a promoter in the reverse orientation, you will reinforce your knowledge that biological parts have inherent directionality, a critical principle for designing and debugging any genetic device.", "problem": "A synthetic biology student is constructing a simple genetic circuit in *Escherichia coli* to express a reporter protein. The intended circuit design consists of four standard DNA parts assembled in the following order: a constitutive prokaryotic promoter (P_const), a Ribosome Binding Site (RBS), the coding sequence for a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), and a transcriptional terminator. In this correct configuration, the circuit leads to a high, constant level of GFP production.\n\nDuring the DNA assembly process, the student makes a mistake. The promoter part (P_const) is accidentally inserted in the reverse orientation. This means the DNA sequence of the promoter part is inverted (flipped 180 degrees) relative to the downstream RBS and GFP gene, but it remains in the same physical location upstream of the RBS. All other parts (RBS, GFP coding sequence, and terminator) are correctly oriented and fully functional. The student proceeds to transform *E. coli* with this incorrectly assembled plasmid.\n\nLet's define a \"promoterless\" circuit as one containing only the RBS, the GFP coding sequence, and the terminator, but lacking any upstream promoter part. Such a circuit is known to exhibit a very low, non-zero, basal level of transcription.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the expected level of GFP expression from the circuit with the reversed promoter, when compared to the promoterless circuit?\n\nA. GFP expression will be significantly higher than in the promoterless circuit because some promoters can function bidirectionally.\n\nB. GFP expression will be approximately the same as in the promoterless circuit.\n\nC. GFP expression will be reduced to zero, a level below even that of the promoterless circuit, due to active transcriptional repression caused by the inverted sequence.\n\nD. GFP expression will be strong and similar to the correctly assembled circuit, as the key chemical components of the promoter DNA are still present.\n\nE. GFP transcription will be initiated but will quickly stop, leading to the production of unstable, non-functional mRNA fragments.", "solution": "In a correctly assembled bacterial expression cassette, a prokaryotic promoter defines both the site and direction of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase holoenzyme via sequence-specific recognition of core elements upstream of the transcription start site. These sequence elements have an intrinsic orientation that determines the direction in which RNA polymerase proceeds. The ribosome binding site and coding sequence must lie in the downstream (sense) direction relative to the promoter to yield a functional mRNA that can be translated into protein.\n\nIf the promoter DNA is inserted in the reverse orientation while remaining upstream of the RBS and coding sequence, the promoter’s orientation relative to the gene is inverted. Consequently:\n1) RNA polymerase can no longer initiate transcription in the sense direction toward the GFP gene from that promoter. Any transcription driven by the inverted promoter would proceed in the opposite direction (away from the gene), generating no sense mRNA for GFP.\n2) Because no sense mRNA is produced from the inverted promoter, the presence of an otherwise functional RBS is irrelevant: no transcript means no translation.\n3) The inverted promoter does not typically act as an active repressor; there is no repressor protein or operator introduced by simply flipping the promoter sequence. Thus, there is no mechanistic basis for expression to drop below the basal read-through level observed in a promoterless construct.\n4) In a promoterless construct, low, non-zero basal transcription arises from cryptic promoters and vector read-through. The plasmid with a reversed promoter still lacks a functional forward promoter upstream of GFP and therefore should exhibit the same mechanism of basal expression as the promoterless case.\n\nConsidering the answer choices:\n- A is not expected because standard constitutive bacterial promoters used in synthetic circuits are designed to be unidirectional under typical conditions; bidirectional activity is not a general property and would not reliably increase expression above the promoterless baseline.\n- C is not supported because inverting the promoter does not introduce active repression that would reduce expression below basal levels arising from cryptic transcription.\n- D is incorrect because promoter function is orientation-dependent; simply having the promoter’s chemical components present does not retain forward activity when the sequence is reversed.\n- E is inconsistent with the mechanism: transcription initiation in the correct (sense) direction is not expected at the inverted promoter, so there is no reason to expect brief, abortive sense transcripts that would yield unstable fragments of GFP mRNA.\n\nTherefore, the best description is that GFP expression with the reversed promoter will be approximately the same as in the promoterless circuit, reflecting basal, non-zero read-through or cryptic transcription rather than promoter-driven expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2070086"}]}
