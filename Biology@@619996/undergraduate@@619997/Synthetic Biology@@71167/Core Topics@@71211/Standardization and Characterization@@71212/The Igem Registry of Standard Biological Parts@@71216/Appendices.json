They are the fundamental building blocks.\n-   **Composite Parts**: These are created by assembling two or more basic parts together to form a new, more complex functional unit.\n\nConsider the composite part `BBa_I714016`, which is a well-characterized genetic device.

According to the BioBrick assembly standard, all parts are flanked by a \"prefix\" containing EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites and a \"suffix\" containing SpeI and PstI restriction sites. The sequence of sites around a part is: `EcoRI - XbaI - PART - SpeI - PstI`.

The XbaI/SpeI junction forms a scar that is not recognized by either enzyme, as required by the BioBrick standard, while the EcoRI and PstI sites remain at the composite’s ends, preserving standard flanking sites.\n\nNext, for correct antibiotic selection, the final construct resides in the `pSB1A3` backbone, which confers ampicillin resistance. Therefore, selection must be on ampicillin, not chloramphenicol.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A uses EcoRI/PstI on both inserts, which does not create the XbaI/SpeI scar junction and selects on chloramphenicol, which is incorrect for an `pSB1A3` final backbone.\n- Option B uses EcoRI/SpeI for P and EcoRI/XbaI for G (correct digestion scheme) but selects on chloramphenicol, which is incorrect for `pSB1A3`.\n- Option C omits ligation, which is not standard and will not produce the desired construct reliably.\n- Option D uses EcoRI/SpeI for P and EcoRI/XbaI for G (correct) and selects on ampicillin, matching the `pSB1A3` backbone.\n- Option E uses XbaI/SpeI on both parts, which removes the necessary EcoRI junction and does not properly set up the composite with prefix/suffix intact.\n\nThus, the correct workflow is described by Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2075797"}, {"introduction": "A correctly assembled genetic device does not operate in a vacuum; it functions within the complex, resource-limited environment of a living cell.

They construct two different plasmids for expression studies.\n\n**Plasmid A** contains a single expression cassette, which is a common part from the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts. This cassette, often denoted `BBa_I13504`, consists of a promoter (`R0040`), a Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) (`B0034`), the coding sequence for a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), and a terminator (`B0015`).

It uses a very strong promoter and a very strong RBS, significantly stronger than those used for the GFP cassette. The RFP cassette also has its own terminator.\n\nAssume that the presence of the second cassette does not affect plasmid copy number, plasmid stability, or the overall health and growth rate of the cells. Both plasmids are transformed into identical strains of *E. coli* which are then grown under identical conditions that ensure the promoters are constitutively active.\n\nWhen comparing the steady-state fluorescence of individual cells containing Plasmid B to those containing Plasmid A, what is the most likely qualitative change in the average amount of functional GFP protein per cell?\n\nA.

Let $R_{\\text{tot}}$ be the total RNA polymerase pool, $R_{\\text{free}}$ the free RNA polymerase, and similarly let $L_{\\text{tot}}$ be the total ribosome pool and $L_{\\text{free}}$ the free ribosome pool. Transcriptional flux for GFP can be written as\n$$\nk_{\\text{tx,G}} = s_{\\text{G}} \\, f_{R}(R_{\\text{free}}),\n$$\nwhere $s_{\\text{G}}$ is the promoter strength of the GFP cassette and $f_{R}$ is an increasing function of $R_{\\text{free}}$ determined by RNAP-promoter binding and initiation. Translation depends on ribosome availability and RBS strength,\n$$\nk_{\\text{tl,G}} = r_{\\text{G}} \\, f_{L}(L_{\\text{free}}),\n$$\nwhere $r_{\\text{G}}$ is the RBS strength and $f_{L}$ is an increasing function of $L_{\\text{free}}$ determined by ribosome-mRNA initiation and elongation dynamics.\n\nResource conservation implies\n$$\nR_{\\text{tot}} = R_{\\text{free}} + R_{\\text{bound,G}} + R_{\\text{bound,R}},\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\text{tot}} = L_{\\text{free}} + L_{\\text{bound on GFP mRNA}} + L_{\\text{bound on RFP mRNA}} + \\text{other cellular loads}.\n$$\nWhen only the GFP cassette is present (Plasmid A), the GFP cassette draws on $R_{\\text{free}}$ and $L_{\\text{free}}$ with no competing synthetic load. When the strong RFP cassette is added (Plasmid B), its very strong promoter increases $R_{\\text{bound,R}}$, decreasing $R_{\\text{free}}$, and its very strong RBS together with higher mRNA abundance increases ribosome sequestration, decreasing $L_{\\text{free}}$.

The GFP amount will not become zero because the GFP cassette retains an active promoter, RBS, and terminator, and the assumptions do not imply complete exhaustion of transcription/translation resources. There is no basis for an increase, nor for a fixed 1:1 molar ratio since expression levels are independently determined by their respective promoter/RBS strengths and resource allocation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely qualitative change is a significant decrease in GFP per cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2075733"}]}
