This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{\\alpha - \\gamma P} = dt\n$$\nNow, we integrate both sides from the initial state $(t=0, P=0)$ to a later state $(t, P(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{P(t)} \\frac{dP'}{\\alpha - \\gamma P'} = \\int_{0}^{t} dt'\n$$\nThe left-hand side integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln(\\alpha - \\gamma P') \\right]_{0}^{P(t)} = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\left( \\ln(\\alpha - \\gamma P(t)) - \\ln(\\alpha - \\gamma \\cdot 0) \\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha - \\gamma P(t)}{\\alpha}\\right)\n$$\nThe right-hand side integral is simply $t$.

The temporal dynamics of the system are not affected by the constant scaling factor $c$.\n\nNow let's consider the amplitude of the signal. The measured steady-state fluorescence $F_{ss}$ is:\n$$\nF_{ss} = c \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma}\n$$\nThe biologist has a numerical value for $F_{ss}$ from the data fit, and they have just determined $\\gamma$ from the time constant of the fit ($k$). The equation becomes:\n$$\nF_{ss} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\alpha}{\\gamma}\n$$\nIn this equation, $F_{ss}$ and $\\gamma$ are known quantities, but both $\\alpha$ and $c$ are unknown. This gives a single equation with two unknowns. It is impossible to solve for $\\alpha$ uniquely without knowing the value of the arbitrary scaling constant $c$. We can only determine the value of the product $c \\cdot \\alpha$:\n$$\nc \\cdot \\alpha = F_{ss} \\cdot \\gamma\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ cannot be separated from $c$, it cannot be uniquely determined from this experiment alone.\n\nTherefore, the degradation rate constant $\\gamma$ can be uniquely determined from the time dynamics of the fluorescence signal, but the synthesis rate $\\alpha$ cannot be determined because it is convolved with the unknown instrumental scaling factor $c$.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that statement B is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2046190"}, {"introduction": "Simple components can be assembled into circuits with surprisingly complex and useful behaviors.
