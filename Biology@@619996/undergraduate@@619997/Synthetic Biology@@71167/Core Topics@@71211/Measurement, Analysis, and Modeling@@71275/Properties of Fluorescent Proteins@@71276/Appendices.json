However, a critical caveat is that these proteins are not instantly fluorescent upon synthesis. They must first undergo a maturation process (e.g., folding and chromophore formation) to become fluorescent. This time delay can distort the measurement of fast-changing signals, such as those in a synthetic genetic oscillator.\n\nConsider a system where a gene oscillator drives the production of a reporter protein.
