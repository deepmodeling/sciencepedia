The circuit is designed as an integral feedback controller and operates as follows:\n\n1.  **Controller Core**: The controller consists of two proteins, $Z_1$ and $R$, which are designed to bind to each other and form an inactive complex, effectively leading to their mutual annihilation. The annihilation reaction is assumed to be very fast and efficient, such that the removal of free $Z_1$ and $R$ is dominated by this process, with their removal by dilution or intrinsic degradation being negligible. Protein $Z_1$ is expressed at a constant rate $\\mu$.

The protein $p$ is stable, and its concentration is reduced solely through dilution as the cells grow and divide; its intrinsic degradation rate is zero.\n\n4.  **Growth Law**: The expression of protein $p$ imposes a significant metabolic burden on the host cells. The bacterial growth rate $\\lambda$ is observed to decrease linearly with the concentration of $p$: $\\lambda(p) = \\lambda_{max} - \\beta p$, where $\\lambda_{max}$ is the maximum possible growth rate in the absence of the heterologous protein and $\\beta$ is a coefficient quantifying the burden.\n\nGiven this system, determine the steady-state concentration of the repressor protein, $R$.
