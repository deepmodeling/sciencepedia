This first practice establishes the core principle of steady-state analysis by examining a common scenario: a substance entering a cell while simultaneously being removed by an internal process. By balancing the rate of passive diffusion across the cell membrane with the rate of first-order enzymatic degradation, you will derive the steady-state intracellular concentration, providing a quantitative link between physical transport parameters and biochemical kinetics [@problem_id:2070626].", "problem": "An engineered microbial strain is being developed for bioremediation of a toxic pollutant in a water reservoir. The bacterial cells are modeled as perfect spheres, each with a radius $r$. The pollutant, present at a constant external concentration $C_{out}$, enters each cell via passive diffusion across the cell membrane. The membrane has a permeability coefficient $P$ for this pollutant. Inside the cell, an engineered enzymatic pathway degrades the pollutant. This degradation process can be accurately modeled by first-order kinetics, where the rate of decrease in the pollutant's intracellular concentration due to degradation is given by $k_{deg} C_{in}$. Here, $C_{in}$ is the instantaneous intracellular concentration of the pollutant and $k_{deg}$ is the first-order degradation rate constant.\n\nAssuming the system reaches a steady state, determine the intracellular concentration of the pollutant, $C_{in, ss}$. Your answer should be a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of the given parameters: $r$, $P$, $C_{out}$, and $k_{deg}$.", "solution": "We model passive diffusion across the membrane using the permeability formulation: the diffusive flux per unit area is $J = P\\left(C_{out} - C_{in}\\right)$. The total influx rate into a spherical cell of surface area $A$ is then $A J = A P\\left(C_{out} - C_{in}\\right)$. Inside the cell, the pollutant is degraded by a first-order process with rate $k_{deg} C_{in}$ per unit volume, so the total degradation rate is $k_{deg} C_{in} V$, where $V$ is the cell volume.\n\nLet $N = C_{in} V$ be the intracellular amount.

In this exercise, we model a synthetic epigenetic control system where the state of a gene is determined by the continuous opposition of a targeted \"writer\" enzyme and a global \"eraser\" enzyme. Instead of a concentration, you will solve for the steady-state *fraction* of modified histone proteins at a gene promoter, revealing how the balance of enzymatic activities establishes a stable regulatory output, a key principle in designing robust gene circuits [@problem_id:2070582].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is designing a system for targeted gene activation by modifying local chromatin structure. The system uses a synthetic \"writer\" enzyme, a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), which is physically tethered to a specific gene's promoter region. This targeting maintains a constant effective concentration of the writer enzyme at the locus, denoted by $C_W$. This writer enzyme adds an acetylation mark to histones.\n\nThe cell naturally contains a globally distributed \"eraser\" enzyme, a histone deacetylase (HDAC), which removes the same acetylation mark. The concentration of this active eraser enzyme is uniform and constant throughout the nucleus, given by $C_E$.\n\nWe can model the kinetics of this system at the target promoter. The rate of histone acetylation (the \"writing\" reaction) is proportional to the fraction of non-acetylated histones, $f_U$, and is given by the expression $k_W C_W f_U$. Here, $k_W$ is the catalytic rate constant for the writer enzyme. Similarly, the rate of histone deacetylation (the \"erasing\" reaction) is proportional to the fraction of acetylated histones, $f_A$, and is given by $k_E C_E f_A$, where $k_E$ is the catalytic rate constant for the eraser enzyme. The total fraction of histone sites is conserved, meaning $f_A + f_U = 1$.\n\nAfter the synthetic system has been active for a sufficient duration, the fractional level of histone acetylation at the target promoter reaches a constant value. Determine the analytic expression for this long-term fractional acetylation, $f_A$. Your answer should be expressed in terms of $C_W$, $k_W$, $C_E$, and $k_E$.", "solution": "Let $f_{A}(t)$ denote the fraction of acetylated histones and $f_{U}(t)$ the fraction of unacetylated histones at the target promoter. Conservation gives $f_{A} + f_{U} = 1$, hence $f_{U} = 1 - f_{A}$.\n\nThe writing (acetylation) rate is $k_{W} C_{W} f_{U}$ and the erasing (deacetylation) rate is $k_{E} C_{E} f_{A}$. The net rate of change of acetylation is therefore\n$$\n\\frac{d f_{A}}{d t} = k_{W} C_{W} f_{U} - k_{E} C_{E} f_{A} = k_{W} C_{W} (1 - f_{A}) - k_{E} C_{E} f_{A}.\n$$\nThis is a linear first-order differential equation, which can be written as\n$$\n\\frac{d f_{A}}{d t} + (k_{W} C_{W} + k_{E} C_{E}) f_{A} = k_{W} C_{W}.\n$$\nAt long times, the system reaches steady state, so $\\frac{d f_{A}}{d t} = 0$.
