To normalize for cell-to-cell variations in protein synthesis capacity (e.g., due to differences in cell size or metabolic state), a second plasmid is co-transformed. This second plasmid contains a gene for the red fluorescent protein mCherry under the control of a strong, constitutive promoter, which serves as a proxy for the global protein synthesis rate.\n\nThe researcher analyzes several bacterial populations using an imaging flow cytometer, which measures the total integrated fluorescence intensity from individual cells in both a green and a red detection channel.
