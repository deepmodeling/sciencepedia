A clever experimental technique using two identical reporter genes allows us to disentangle these contributions. This practice will guide you through the analysis of data from such a dual-reporter system to calculate the fraction of noise that is extrinsic, providing a deeper insight into the sources of cellular variability [@problem_id:1440242].", "problem": "In a systems biology experiment to study gene expression noise, a population of genetically identical bacteria is engineered. Each bacterium carries a plasmid containing two different reporter genes, Gene 1 and Gene 2, which code for Protein 1 (P1) and Protein 2 (P2), respectively. The expression of both genes is driven by identical, constitutively active promoters. This setup ensures that, on average, both proteins are produced at the same rate.\n\nAfter allowing the bacterial culture to reach a steady state, the number of P1 and P2 molecules is measured in thousands of individual cells. Let $p_1$ and $p_2$ represent the number of molecules of P1 and P2 in a randomly selected cell. The analysis of this data yields the following statistical properties:\n\n- The mean number of molecules for each protein is identical: $\\langle p_1 \\rangle = \\langle p_2 \\rangle = 1250$ molecules.\n- The total cell-to-cell variation, or variance, for each protein's molecule count is also identical: $\\operatorname{Var}(p_1) = \\operatorname{Var}(p_2) = 4.50 \\times 10^5 \\text{ molecules}^2$.\n- The covariance between the molecule counts of the two proteins is: $\\operatorname{Cov}(p_1, p_2) = 3.60 \\times 10^5 \\text{ molecules}^2$.\n\nThe total variance in the expression of a single gene, e.g., $\\operatorname{Var}(p_1)$, can be theoretically decomposed into the sum of two components: intrinsic noise and extrinsic noise.

Extrinsic noise arises from fluctuations in shared cellular components (like ribosomes or polymerases) that affect both genes simultaneously. For this dual-reporter system, the extrinsic noise component of the variance, denoted $\\sigma_{\\text{ext}}^2$, is equal to the covariance between the two protein levels, i.e., $\\sigma_{\\text{ext}}^2 = \\operatorname{Cov}(p_1, p_2)$.\n\nCalculate the fraction of the total variance in the expression of Protein 1 that is attributable to extrinsic noise.

The goal is to create a system where the mean expression level and the stochastic noise of the FP can be tuned independently. The proposed circuit has the following features:\n\n1.  The gene encoding the FP is placed under the control of a promoter whose transcription rate, $k_{txn}$, is linearly dependent on the concentration of an external small molecule, Inducer A ($c_A$). The relationship is given by $k_{txn} = k_{txn,0} + \\alpha c_A$, where $k_{txn,0}$ and $\\alpha$ are positive constants.\n2.  The messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from this gene contains a specially engineered 5' untranslated region (UTR) that acts as a riboswitch. This riboswitch binds to a second, distinct small molecule, Inducer B ($c_B$). This binding event alters the mRNA secondary structure and modulates the translation initiation rate, $k_{tl}$. This relationship is also linear: $k_{tl} = k_{tl,0} + \\beta c_B$, where $k_{tl,0}$ and $\\beta$ are positive constants.\n3.  Both the mRNA and the FP are subject to first-order degradation with constant rates $\\gamma_m$ and $\\gamma_p$, respectively.\n\nYou can model the system as a two-stage process of gene expression (transcription and translation). Assume that the transcription process follows Poisson statistics (i.e., the promoter does not exhibit transcriptional bursting and is always in an 'ON' state). Neglect any extrinsic noise arising from fluctuations in the cellular environment (e.g., polymerases, ribosomes).\n\nYour task is to determine the concentrations of Inducer A and Inducer B required to achieve a desired steady-state cellular profile defined by a specific mean protein number, $\\mu_{target}$, and a specific protein Fano factor, $F_{target}$.
