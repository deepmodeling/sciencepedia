The circuit's output, Z, is defined as HIGH (Z=1) if the cell exhibits strong fluorescence, and LOW (Z=0) otherwise. This fluorescence is produced by a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), whose gene is under the control of a specific promoter, $P_{out}$.\n\nThe circuit's behavior is controlled by two chemical inducers, which serve as the logical inputs X and Y. A value of 1 for an input means the corresponding inducer is present in the growth medium, and a value of 0 means it is absent.\n\nThe system is designed with the following rules:\n1.  The promoter $P_{out}$ has a negligible basal expression level. GFP is only produced if an activator protein is bound to this promoter's operator site.\n2.  The presence of Inducer X (X=1) causes the cell to produce an activator protein, A. In the absence of Inducer X (X=0), protein A is not produced.\n3.  The presence of Inducer Y (Y=1) causes the cell to produce a repressor protein, B. In the absence of Inducer Y (Y=0), protein B is not produced.\n4.  Both protein A (the activator) and protein B (the repressor) are designed to bind to the exact same operator site on the promoter $P_{out}$.\n5.  Due to its molecular structure, protein B has a significantly higher binding affinity for the operator site than protein A. Consequently, if both proteins A and B are present in the cell, protein B will outcompete protein A and will be the one bound to the operator site.\n\nGiven this design, which of the following Boolean expressions correctly describes the relationship between the inputs (X, Y) and the output (Z)?\n\nA.

By rule 1, the promoter $P_{out}$ has negligible basal expression, so $Z=1$ only if an activator is bound.\n\nBy rule 2, activator protein $A$ is produced if and only if $X=1$. By rule 3, repressor protein $B$ is produced if and only if $Y=1$.\n\nBy rules 4 and 5, $A$ and $B$ compete for the same operator site, with $B$ having higher affinity. Therefore:\n- If $Y=1$ (so $B$ present), the operator is occupied by $B$ regardless of whether $A$ is present, preventing activation, hence $Z=0$.\n- If $Y=0$ (so $B$ absent), then:\n  - If $X=1$ (so $A$ present), $A$ binds and activates $P_{out}$, giving $Z=1$.\n  - If $X=0$ (so $A$ absent), no activator binds, giving $Z=0$.\n\nThus $Z=1$ exactly when $X=1$ and $Y=0$.
