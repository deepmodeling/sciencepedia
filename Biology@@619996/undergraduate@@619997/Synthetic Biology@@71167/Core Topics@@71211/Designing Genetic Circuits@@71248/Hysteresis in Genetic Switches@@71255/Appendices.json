This system exhibits bistability, allowing it to exist in two stable states: one with high U concentration and low V concentration (the 'ON' state for U), and another with low U and high V (the 'OFF' state for U). The system's dynamics are governed by a maximal protein production rate $\\alpha$, a first-order protein degradation and dilution rate $\\delta$ (assumed to be the same for both proteins), and a Hill coefficient $n$ for the repressive interactions.\n\nInitially, the switch is in the stable 'OFF' state for protein U. In this state, the concentration of U, denoted as $u(t)$, can be considered to be effectively zero, while the concentration of protein V, denoted as $v(t)$, is at its high steady-state level determined by the system parameters.\n\nTo flip the switch to the 'ON' state for U, an external inducer pulse is applied for a time duration $T$. The physical effect of this inducer is modeled as follows: during the pulse (from $t=0$ to $t=T$), the repression on gene U is completely removed, causing protein U to be produced at its maximal rate. Simultaneously, the inducer partially inhibits the expression of gene V, reducing its maximal production rate by a factor of $(1+A)$, where $A$ is a positive, dimensionless constant representing the inducer's amplitude. Assume that during the pulse, the concentration of U is too low to exert significant repression on gene V.\n\nAn irreversible switch is considered successful if the system's state has crossed a critical threshold by the time the pulse ends. For this problem, we will use the following simplified criterion for a successful flip: the switch is guaranteed to flip if, at the exact moment the pulse ends (at time $t=T$), the concentration of protein U has become greater than the concentration of protein V.\n\nBased on this model, derive a symbolic expression for the minimum pulse duration, $T_{min}$, required to flip the switch. Your final expression should be in terms of the degradation rate $\\delta$ and the inducer amplitude $A$.", "solution": "During the inducer pulse, repression on gene U is removed and U is produced at its maximal rate while degrading at the first-order rate.

The circuit consists of three genes, `genA`, `genB`, and `genC`, which produce protein products A, B, and C, respectively. The regulatory interactions are as follows:\n- Each protein (A, B, or C) acts as a transcriptional activator for its own gene, creating a positive feedback loop.\n- Each protein acts as a transcriptional repressor for the other two genes. For example, protein A represses the transcription of `genB` and `genC`.\n\nThis \"winner-take-all\" architecture results in three mutually exclusive, stable steady states:\n- **State A**: High concentration of protein A, low concentrations of B and C.\n- **State B**: High concentration of protein B, low concentrations of A and C.\n- **State C**: High concentration of protein C, low concentrations of A and B.\n\nThe behavior of the circuit can be controlled by two external, membrane-permeable small molecules, inducer $I_A$ and inducer $I_B$.\n- Inducer $I_A$ strongly activates the transcription of `genA`.\n- Inducer $I_B$ strongly activates the transcription of `genB`.\n\nAn experiment is conducted on a population of these bacteria.

For sufficiently strong auto-activation and cross-repression, the system exhibits three mutually exclusive stable steady states (winner-take-all): A-dominant $(a\\gg b,c)$, B-dominant $(b\\gg a,c)$, and C-dominant $(c\\gg a,b)$.\n\nAt each step $t_{k}$, the state $S_{k}$ is the asymptotically stable fixed point selected by the inputs $(I_{A},I_{B})$ from the previous state’s basin of attraction.\n\nInitial condition: at $t_{0}$, the system is prepared in State C, i.e., $c$ is high and $a,b$ are low.\n\nStep at $t_{1}$ (add $I_{A}$): Turning on $I_{A}$ raises $\\beta_{A}(I_{A})$. The $\\dot a=0$ nullcline shifts upward so that, despite repression by $c$, production of $a$ exceeds $\\gamma_{A}a$ once $a$ grows past the activation threshold $K_{AA}$.

The only stable steady state consistent with strong $I_{A}$ in a winner-take-all circuit is A-dominant. Therefore, after equilibration, $S_{1}=\\text{A}$.\n\nStep at $t_{2}$ (add $I_{B}$, keep $I_{A}$): Now both $\\beta_{A}(I_{A})$ and $\\beta_{B}(I_{B})$ are large. The potential stable steady states under these inputs are A-dominant and B-dominant; C-dominant is disfavored because $c$ receives no external activation and is repressed by both A and B. The system is currently at A-dominant with $a$ high and $b$ repressed. In the $db/dt$ equation, the repression factor $\\frac{K_{AB}^{m}}{K_{AB}^{m}+a^{m}}$ remains small while $a$ is high, preventing $b$ from rising despite the increase in $\\beta_{B}(I_{B})$. Positive feedback on A plus its head start keeps the trajectory inside the basin of the A-dominant fixed point. Thus, after equilibration, $S_{2}=\\text{A}$.\n\nStep at $t_{3}$ (remove $I_{A}$, keep $I_{B}$): Removing $I_{A}$ reduces $\\beta_{A}(I_{A})$ back to baseline, shifting the $\\dot a=0$ nullcline downward so that the A-dominant fixed point loses stability under continued repression by rising $b$. Meanwhile, $\\beta_{B}(I_{B})$ remains high, so any relief of A-mediated repression allows $b$ to increase via its auto-activation. As $b$ rises it further represses $a$ through the factor $\\frac{K_{BA}^{m}}{K_{BA}^{m}+b^{m}}$ in $\\dot a$, tipping the system into the B-dominant winner-take-all state. Therefore, after equilibration, $S_{3}=\\text{B}$.\n\nStep at $t_{4}$ (remove $I_{B}$): With both inducers absent, the circuit reverts to its intrinsic tristability. Starting from the B-dominant fixed point with strong self-activation, the system remains in that basin because no input perturbs it across a separatrix to A- or C-dominant states. Hence, after equilibration, $S_{4}=\\text{B}$.\n\nCollecting the states, the sequence is $(S_{1},S_{2},S_{3},S_{4})=(\\text{A},\\text{A},\\text{B},\\text{B})$, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2042962"}]}
