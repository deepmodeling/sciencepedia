For a one-dimensional system like this, the stability of the steady-states alternates when they are ordered along the concentration axis. We only need to determine the stability of one of the states to infer the stability of the others.\n\nLet's analyze the stability of the $[P]_0 = 0$ state. A state is stable if, following a small perturbation, the system tends to return to it.

Specifically, $\\frac{\\alpha}{K^2} = \\frac{12.5}{100^2} = 0.00125$. The net rate $\\frac{d[P]}{dt} \\approx [P](0.00125[P] - 0.050)$. Since $[P]$ is small and positive, the term in the parenthesis is negative. Thus, $\\frac{d[P]}{dt} < 0$, which means that if the concentration is slightly above zero, it will decrease back towards zero. Therefore, the steady-state at $[P]_0 = 0$ is stable.\n\nSince the steady-states must alternate in stability, we can order them and assign stability:\n1. $[P]_0 = 0$ nM: Stable\n2. $[P]_{-} = 50$ nM: Unstable\n3. $[P]_{+} = 200$ nM: Stable\n\nThe stable steady-states are 0 nM and 200 nM. These represent the \"OFF\" and \"ON\" states of the genetic switch, respectively. The system can stably exist at either a very low concentration or a high concentration of protein P.\n\nThe problem asks for the stable steady-state concentrations arranged in ascending order.
