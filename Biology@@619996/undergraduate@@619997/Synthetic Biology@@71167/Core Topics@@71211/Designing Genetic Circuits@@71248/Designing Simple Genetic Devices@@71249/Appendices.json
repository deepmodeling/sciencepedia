The process requires two enzymes, Enzyme X and Enzyme Y, to be co-expressed within the same cell. To achieve optimal pathway flux, the steady-state concentrations of the two enzymes must be maintained at a specific ratio of $[Enzyme\\ X] : [Enzyme\\ Y] = 1 : 10$.\n\nThe gene for Enzyme X is cloned into a high-copy number plasmid with a copy number of $N_{H}$. The gene for Enzyme Y is cloned into a compatible low-copy number plasmid with a copy number of $N_{L}$. Each gene is placed under the control of its own promoter, with strengths $S_{X}$ and $S_{Y}$ respectively.\n\nFor this system, you can make the following simplifying assumptions. The rate-limiting step for protein production is transcription, so the promoter strength is directly proportional to the rate of protein synthesis. Furthermore, the translation efficiencies and the degradation rates for both enzymes and their corresponding messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts are identical. Consequently, the steady-state concentration of each enzyme is directly proportional to the product of its plasmid's copy number and its promoter's strength.\n\nBased on this model, determine the required ratio of promoter strengths, $\\frac{S_{X}}{S_{Y}}$, to achieve the target enzyme concentration ratio.
