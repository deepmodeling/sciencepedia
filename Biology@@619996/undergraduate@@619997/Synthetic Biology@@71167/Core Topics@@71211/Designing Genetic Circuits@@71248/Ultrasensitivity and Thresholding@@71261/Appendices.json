The core of this circuit is an engineered transcriptional activator protein that binds to the signaling molecule. The binding of the molecule induces a conformational change in the activator, allowing it to bind to a specific Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) promoter sequence and turn on the expression of a reporter gene.\n\nThe fractional activation, $Y$, of the transcriptional activator population is a measure of the proportion of activator proteins that are bound by the signaling molecule. This relationship is well-described by the Hill equation:\n$$Y = \\frac{[S]^n}{K_A^n + [S]^n}$$\nwhere $[S]$ is the concentration of the signaling molecule, $K_A$ is the activation constant (the concentration of $[S]$ at which half of the activators are bound), and $n$ is the Hill coefficient, which describes the cooperativity of the binding process.\n\nThrough protein engineering, the team designed the activator to have a Hill coefficient of $n = 3$ and an activation constant of $K_A = 50.0$ nanomoles per liter (nM). The biosensor is then tested in a solution where the concentration of the signaling molecule is measured to be $[S] = 40.0$ nM.\n\nCalculate the fractional activation, $Y$, of the transcriptional activator under these conditions.

A higher value of $n$ corresponds to a more switch-like, or ultrasensitive, system.\n\nA key metric for characterizing the \"sharpness\" of this biological switch is the dynamic range of input concentrations required to transition the system from a nearly \"off\" state to a nearly \"on\" state.
