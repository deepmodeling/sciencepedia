In the absence of their repressors, both promoters are constitutively active, so $s_{1}(0)=\\alpha_{1}>0$ and $s_{2}(0)=\\alpha_{2}>0$.\n\nThe assembly error deletes promoter $P_{1}$ completely.

When the inducer concentration $c$ is slowly increased from zero, the protein concentration $p$ follows a path to a single, stable low-expression state. As $c$ continues to increase, it reaches an upper critical threshold, at which point the system abruptly jumps to a stable high-expression state. Conversely, when the inducer concentration is slowly decreased from a very high value, the system remains in the high-expression state until it reaches a lower critical threshold, causing an abrupt switch back to the low-expression state. The range of inducer concentrations between these two thresholds defines the bistable region, where the system can exist in either the low- or high-expression state depending on its history.\n\nDetermine the values of the lower and upper critical inducer concentrations that form the boundaries of this bistable region.
