The goal is for the circuit to respond only to a sustained environmental signal, filtering out brief, noisy fluctuations. The circuit architecture is a Coherent Type 1 Feed-Forward Loop (C1-FFL).\n\nThe circuit involves three genes:\n1. An input transcription factor, X, which is activated by the environmental signal.\n2. An intermediate protein, Y.\n3. A final output protein, Z (e.g., a fluorescent reporter).\n\nThe regulatory logic is as follows:\n- Protein X activates the production of Protein Y.\n- Protein X also activates the production of Protein Z.\n- Protein Y is also required to activate the production of Protein Z. Therefore, Z is only produced when both X and Y are present above their respective activation thresholds.\n\nLet's model the dynamics of the intermediate protein Y. Assume the system starts with no X, Y, or Z. At time $t=0$, the bacterium is exposed to a short pulse of the environmental signal, causing the concentration of active X to be constant for a duration $T$. After time $T$, the signal is removed, and the concentration of active X immediately returns to zero.\n\nWhen X is present, the rate of production of Y is a constant, $\\alpha$. Protein Y is continuously degraded at a rate proportional to its own concentration, $[Y]$, with a first-order rate constant $\\beta$. The concentration of Y at time $t=0$ is zero.\n\nThe circuit is designed such that the production of Z requires the concentration of Y to exceed a threshold $K_Y$. For this particular short pulse of duration $T$, the concentration of Y never reaches this threshold.\n\nDerive a complete, piecewise expression for the concentration of protein Y, denoted as $[Y](t)$, for all times $t \\ge 0$.", "solution": "We model the intermediate protein concentration $[Y](t)$ with a first-order linear ODE whose production term depends on the presence of $X$. For $0 \\le t \\le T$, the environmental signal activates $X$, so the production rate of $Y$ is constant $\\alpha$. Degradation is first order with rate constant $\\beta$. Thus, for $0 \\le t \\le T$,\n$$\n\\frac{d[Y]}{dt}=\\alpha-\\beta [Y], \\quad [Y](0)=0.\n$$\nThis is a linear ODE.

The circuit is designed to respond to the presence of an inducer molecule, arabinose. The circuit's output is monitored by measuring the cellular concentrations of three distinct reporter proteins: a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), and a Blue Fluorescent Protein (BFP). The team conducts two experiments by introducing arabinose into the bacterial culture medium.\n\n**Experiment 1: Short Pulse Input**\nArabinose is added to the culture at time $t=0$ and is completely removed at a later time $t = T_{short}$. The team observes the following:\n*   The concentration of GFP begins to rise shortly after $t=0$, peaks, and then declines back to a negligible level after arabinose is removed.\n*   The concentration of RFP begins to rise with a slight delay compared to GFP, but its concentration never reaches a substantial level before it also begins to decline.\n*   The concentration of BFP shows no significant increase above its baseline level throughout the experiment.\n\n**Experiment 2: Sustained Input**\nArabinose is added to the culture at time $t=0$ and is maintained at a constant concentration for a long duration, $t \\gg T_{short}$. The team observes the following:\n*   The concentration of GFP begins to rise shortly after $t=0$ and approaches a high, steady-state level.\n*   The concentration of RFP begins to rise after a noticeable delay compared to GFP and also approaches a high, steady-state level.\n*   The concentration of BFP only begins to increase after the concentrations of both GFP and RFP have become significant. The BFP concentration then continues to rise, eventually approaching its own high, steady-state level.\n\nBased on these observations, which one of the following proposed regulatory network architectures is consistent with the experimental results?\n\nA. Arabinose activates the production of GFP. GFP in turn activates the production of RFP. The production of BFP is activated only when both GFP and RFP are present.\n\nB. Arabinose activates the production of GFP. GFP activates the production of RFP. RFP activates the production of BFP.\n\nC. Arabinose activates the production of GFP. GFP, in turn, independently activates the production of both RFP and BFP.\n\nD. Arabinose activates the production of GFP. GFP directly activates BFP production. GFP also activates RFP production, and RFP, in turn, represses BFP production.\n\nE. Arabinose activates the production of GFP. GFP activates RFP, and RFP activates BFP. BFP, in turn, represses the production of GFP.", "solution": "The goal is to determine which network topology explains the observed dynamics of the three proteins (GFP, RFP, BFP) in response to a short pulse versus a sustained input of arabinose. We will analyze the key features of the experimental results and then evaluate each proposed architecture.\n\nThe central puzzle lies in the differential response of BFP between the two experiments. In Experiment 1 (short pulse), BFP is not produced. In Experiment 2 (sustained input), BFP is produced, but only after both GFP and RFP have reached significant concentrations. This suggests a regulatory logic where BFP production requires the simultaneous presence of two inputs. This type of logic gate is known as an AND gate.\n\nLet's analyze the observations in detail:\n1.  **GFP Response:** In both experiments, GFP production starts shortly after arabinose is added. This indicates that arabinose directly or indirectly initiates GFP production. In all proposed models, arabinose activates GFP, which is consistent with this observation.\n\n2.  **RFP Response:** RFP production is delayed relative to GFP in both experiments. This suggests that GFP is an activator for RFP. This is consistent with options A, B, D, and E. Option C proposes that GFP activates RFP, so it is also consistent with this point.\n\n3.  **BFP Response - The Key Discriminator:**\n    *   **Experiment 1 (Short Pulse):** Arabinose is removed before RFP can accumulate to a high level. BFP is not produced. This implies that the presence of GFP alone (during its transient pulse) is insufficient to trigger BFP production.\n    *   **Experiment 2 (Sustained Input):** BFP production begins only after *both* GFP and RFP concentrations are significant. This strongly points to an AND-gate logic, where BFP's promoter requires both GFP and RFP as co-activators. Furthermore, once BFP production starts, it continues and reaches a high steady state, implying the overall interaction is activatory, not leading to repression or oscillations in the final state.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option against these conclusions:\n\n**A. Arabinose activates GFP. GFP activates RFP. BFP production requires both GFP and RFP.** This is a classic Type 1 Coherent Feedforward Loop (C1-FFL) with AND logic.\n*   It correctly models the activation of GFP by arabinose and RFP by GFP.\n*   The AND-gate logic for BFP (requiring both GFP and RFP) perfectly explains the experimental results. In the short pulse experiment, the signal (arabinose) is removed before the slower, indirect path (GFP -> RFP) can complete. Thus, RFP never reaches the threshold concentration needed to co-activate BFP with GFP. In the sustained experiment, both activators accumulate, turning on BFP production. This architecture acts as a \"persistence detector,\" which is exactly what the data shows. This option is fully consistent.\n\n**B. Linear Cascade (Arabinose -> GFP -> RFP -> BFP).**\n*   This model is inconsistent with the BFP data. If RFP activates BFP, then in Experiment 1, as soon as RFP concentration begins to rise (even slightly), some BFP should be produced. The observation is a *lack* of significant BFP production. This model lacks the AND-gate mechanism needed to filter out the short pulse.\n\n**C. Fan-out (Arabinose -> GFP; GFP activates RFP and BFP independently).**\n*   This model is inconsistent. If GFP alone activates BFP, then in Experiment 1, a pulse of BFP should have been observed concurrently with the pulse of GFP. This contradicts the observation that BFP levels did not increase.\n\n**D. Incoherent Feedforward Loop (I1-FFL with repression).**\n*   This model has two paths from GFP to BFP: a direct activation and an indirect repression (via RFP). This topology typically produces a pulse of output (BFP) in response to a sustained input. The system is turned ON by the fast direct path and then turned OFF by the slow indirect path's repressor. The observation in Experiment 2 is a sustained, high level of BFP, not a pulse. Therefore, this model is inconsistent.\n\n**E. Negative Feedback Loop (Arabinose -> GFP -> RFP -> BFP ->| GFP).**\n*   This model's primary feature is the repression of an early component (GFP) by a late component (BFP). This would typically lead to homeostasis or oscillations. The experimental description mentions GFP rising to a high, steady state, with no indication of being repressed later by BFP. More importantly, this architecture does not explain the core observation: the AND-gate requirement for BFP activation.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option A, the C1-FFL with AND logic, can account for all the experimental observations, particularly the system's ability to discriminate between a short pulse and a sustained input signal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2027073"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice bridges abstract theory with tangible application, placing you in the role of a synthetic biologist at the design bench.
