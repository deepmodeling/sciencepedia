The engineered genetic circuit is designed such that the pollutant molecule acts as an inducer, binding to a transcriptional activator protein and initiating the expression of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The fractional activation of the gene promoter, denoted by $Y$, which corresponds to the normalized fluorescence level, is well-described by the Hill equation for an activator:\n\n$$Y = \\frac{[L]^{n}}{K_{M}^{n} + [L]^{n}}$$\n\nHere, $[L]$ is the concentration of the pollutant (the ligand), $K_{M}$ is the ligand concentration that yields half-maximal activation, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient, which describes the cooperativity of the binding process.\n\nFor this specific biosensor design, the activator protein dimerizes before binding to the DNA, resulting in a Hill coefficient of $n=2$. The engineers want to calibrate the sensor and determine the concentration of the pollutant that corresponds to a \"high-level\" detection signal, which they define as 90% of the maximum possible promoter activation.\n\nDetermine the exact concentration of the pollutant, $[L]$, required to achieve 90% activation. Express your answer as a multiple of $K_{M}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the concentration of the pollutant, $[L]$, that results in a fractional activation of $Y = 0.90$. The relationship between $Y$ and $[L]$ is given by the Hill equation.\n\nThe given Hill equation is:\n$$Y = \\frac{[L]^{n}}{K_{M}^{n} + [L]^{n}}$$\n\nWe are provided with the following values:\n- The desired fractional activation, $Y = 0.90$.\n- The Hill coefficient, $n = 2$.\n\nWe need to solve for $[L]$ in terms of $K_{M}$. Let's substitute the known values into the equation:\n$$0.90 = \\frac{[L]^{2}}{K_{M}^{2} + [L]^{2}}$$\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate the term $[L]$. First, multiply both sides by the denominator $(K_{M}^{2} + [L]^{2})$:\n$$0.90 \\cdot (K_{M}^{2} + [L]^{2}) = [L]^{2}$$\n\nDistribute the $0.90$ on the left-hand side:\n$$0.90 K_{M}^{2} + 0.90 [L]^{2} = [L]^{2}$$\n\nNext, we want to group all terms containing $[L]^{2}$ on one side of the equation. We can subtract $0.90 [L]^{2}$ from both sides:\n$$0.90 K_{M}^{2} = [L]^{2} - 0.90 [L]^{2}$$\n$$0.90 K_{M}^{2} = (1 - 0.90) [L]^{2}$$\n$$0.90 K_{M}^{2} = 0.10 [L]^{2}$$\n\nTo solve for $[L]^{2}$, we can divide both sides by $0.10$:\n$$[L]^{2} = \\frac{0.90}{0.10} K_{M}^{2}$$\n$$[L]^{2} = 9 K_{M}^{2}$$\n\nFinally, to solve for $[L]$, we take the square root of both sides. Since concentration must be a positive value, we only consider the positive root:\n$$[L] = \\sqrt{9 K_{M}^{2}}$$\n$$[L] = 3 K_{M}$$\n\nThus, the concentration of the pollutant required to achieve 90% activation is 3 times the half-maximal activation constant $K_{M}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3K_{M}}$$", "id": "2040328"}, {"introduction": "Genetic circuits do not operate in a vacuum; they function within the complex environment of a living cell.
