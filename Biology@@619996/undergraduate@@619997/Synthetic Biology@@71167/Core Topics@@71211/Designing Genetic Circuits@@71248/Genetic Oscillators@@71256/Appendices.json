This first practice explores the most fundamental property of an oscillator—its frequency—by examining a simple auto-repressive circuit. By considering how the speed of protein degradation affects the cycle time [@problem_id:2040079], you will build crucial intuition for how the \"lifespan\" of molecular components acts as a pacemaker for the entire system.", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists has engineered a simple genetic oscillator in a bacterial host. The circuit consists of a single gene that codes for a repressor protein, let's call it Repressor Z. The expression of this gene is controlled by a promoter that is, in turn, inhibited by Repressor Z itself. This creates a negative feedback loop: when the concentration of Repressor Z is high, it binds to its own promoter and shuts down its production; as existing Repressor Z proteins are naturally degraded by the cell, their concentration falls, the promoter becomes active again, and the production cycle restarts. This entire process results in periodic oscillations in the concentration of Repressor Z.\n\nInitially, the experiment is conducted in a standard bacterial strain. The team then decides to switch to a new, mutant strain of the same bacteria. This mutant strain possesses a more active set of intracellular proteases, which are enzymes responsible for protein breakdown. For the purpose of this problem, assume that this change only affects the degradation rate of Repressor Z, increasing it significantly, while all other parameters of the system (e.g., transcription rate, translation rate, promoter binding affinity) remain unchanged.\n\nHow will this increased degradation rate of Repressor Z most likely affect the oscillations in the concentration of the protein?\n\nA. The frequency of oscillations will increase.\n\nB. The frequency of oscillations will decrease.\n\nC. The frequency of oscillations will remain unchanged, but the amplitude of the oscillations will decrease.\n\nD. The oscillations will be suppressed, and the system will settle into a steady state with a constant, high concentration of Repressor Z.\n\nE. The oscillations will be suppressed, and the system will settle into a steady state with a constant, low concentration of Repressor Z.", "solution": "Let $Z(t)$ denote the concentration of Repressor Z. Let the maximal production rate when the promoter is active be $s$ (units of concentration per unit time), and let the first-order degradation rate constant be $\\delta$ (wild type). The mutant increases only the degradation rate to $\\delta'$, with $\\delta' > \\delta$. All other parameters are unchanged.\n\nTo capture the negative feedback with strong nonlinearity (cooperativity) that produces oscillations, approximate the promoter regulation by two switching thresholds: when $Z$ rises to $H$, production is shut off; when $Z$ decays to $L$ (with $0<L<H$), production turns back on. This piecewise linear approximation captures the timing of an auto-repressive relaxation oscillator.\n\nDuring the repressed phase (production off), the dynamics are\n$$\n\\frac{dZ}{dt}=-\\delta Z \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad Z(t)=Z_{0}\\exp(-\\delta t).\n$$\nStarting from $Z=H$ and decaying to $Z=L$, the decay time is\n$$\nt_{\\text{decay}}=\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{H}{L}\\right).\n$$\n\nDuring the active phase (production on at rate $s$), the dynamics are\n$$\n\\frac{dZ}{dt}=s-\\delta Z,\n$$\nwith solution\n$$\nZ(t)=Z_{\\infty}+(Z_{0}-Z_{\\infty})\\exp(-\\delta t), \\quad Z_{\\infty}=\\frac{s}{\\delta}.\n$$\nStarting from $Z=L$ and rising to $Z=H$, the rise time $t_{\\text{rise}}$ satisfies\n$$\nH-Z_{\\infty}=(L-Z_{\\infty})\\exp(-\\delta t_{\\text{rise}}) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\nt_{\\text{rise}}=\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{L-Z_{\\infty}}{H-Z_{\\infty}}\\right).\n$$\nFor sustained oscillations, one must have $Z_{\\infty}>H$ so that the trajectory can cross the repression threshold; in this regime both $L-Z_{\\infty}$ and $H-Z_{\\infty}$ are negative and their ratio is positive.\n\nThe oscillation period $T$ is the sum\n$$\nT=t_{\\text{rise}}+t_{\\text{decay}}=\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\left[\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{L-Z_{\\infty}}{H-Z_{\\infty}}\\right)+\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{H}{L}\\right)\\right]\n=\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{H\\,(L-Z_{\\infty})}{L\\,(H-Z_{\\infty})}\\right),\n$$\nwith $Z_{\\infty}=s/\\delta$. The frequency is $\\nu=\\frac{1}{T}$.\n\nNow consider increasing the degradation rate to $\\delta'$. Two effects follow:\n\n- Time-scale effect: both $t_{\\text{rise}}$ and $t_{\\text{decay}}$ carry the prefactor $\\frac{1}{\\delta}$, so, all else equal, increasing $\\delta$ decreases $T$ approximately proportionally, hence increases the frequency $\\nu$.\n\n- Amplitude/threshold feasibility: $Z_{\\infty}=s/\\delta$ decreases as $\\delta$ increases. If $s/\\delta$ remains greater than $H$, the oscillation persists and the dominant $\\frac{1}{\\delta}$ scaling makes $T$ smaller, so the frequency increases. If $s/\\delta$ falls below $H$, the trajectory can no longer reach the repression threshold; production never turns off, and the system settles to the steady state $Z^{*}=s/\\delta$ at a low concentration (oscillations suppressed).\n\nUnder the problem’s assumption of an engineered oscillatory regime and a parameter change that “most likely” preserves oscillations (all other parameters fixed), the principal and robust effect of increasing the degradation rate is to shorten the period and therefore increase the oscillation frequency. Any accompanying amplitude reduction does not alter this conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the oscillation frequency increases.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2040079"}, {"introduction": "An oscillator circuit does not always oscillate; its behavior can dramatically change with shifts in underlying biochemical parameters.

The period of the oscillator, $T_p$, is determined by the total degradation rate, $k_{deg}$, of a key repressor protein, following the simple relation $T_p = C/k_{deg}$, where $C$ is a constant. The degradation machinery consists of two pathways: a basal pathway and an externally inducible pathway.\n\nThe total degradation rate is the sum of the rates from these two pathways: $k_{deg}(T, [I]) = k_{basal}(T) + k_{ind}(T, [I])$. Here, $T$ is the absolute temperature and $[I]$ is the concentration of a chemical inducer.\n\nBoth rates are temperature-dependent, following an Arrhenius-like model:\n1.  The basal degradation rate is $k_{basal}(T) = k_{b,0} \\exp(-E_{basal}/(k_B T))$, where $k_{b,0}$ is a pre-exponential factor, $E_{basal}$ is the activation energy of the basal pathway, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n2.  The inducible degradation rate is $k_{ind}(T, [I]) = k_{i,0} \\frac{[I]}{K_I + [I]} \\exp(-E_{ind}/(k_B T))$, where $k_{i,0}$ is a pre-exponential factor, $E_{ind}$ is the activation energy of the inducible pathway, and $K_I$ is the inducer concentration for half-maximal induction.\n\nTwo key performance metrics are defined for a reference temperature $T_0$:\n-   **Tunability Range ($R_{tune}$)**: The ratio of the oscillator's period with no inducer to its period at saturating inducer concentration, defined as $R_{tune} = \\frac{T_p(T_0, [I]=0)}{T_p(T_0, [I]\\to\\infty)}$.\n-   **Temperature Sensitivity ($S_T$)**: A dimensionless measure of how much the period changes with temperature, evaluated at an intermediate inducer level $[I]=K_I$.
