A common task is to characterize the behavior of these synthetic circuits. Consider a simple synthetic gene circuit implemented in a bacterium where a gene is continuously transcribed to produce a specific messenger RNA (mRNA). The concentration of this mRNA, denoted by $M(t)$, changes over time according to the following ordinary differential equation, which accounts for both its production and degradation:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = \\alpha - \\beta M(t) $$\nHere, $\\alpha$ is the constant transcription rate, representing the number of mRNA molecules produced per unit volume per unit time. The term $\\beta M(t)$ represents the degradation of the mRNA, where $\\beta$ is the first-order degradation rate constant.\n\nAfter the system has been running for a long time, the mRNA concentration reaches a stable, constant value. Experimental measurements reveal that this steady-state concentration of the mRNA is $216.5$ molecules per microliter. The transcription rate is independently measured to be $\\alpha = 5.00$ molecules per microliter per minute.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the half-life of a single molecule of this synthetic mRNA.

This insight is crucial for tuning the output of synthetic circuits by modifying mRNA half-life.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a researcher designs a genetic construct to simultaneously express two different reporter proteins. The genes for these proteins are transcribed into two distinct messenger RNA (mRNA) species, which we will call mRNA-X and mRNA-Y. Both genes are placed under the control of identical, constitutively active promoters, resulting in the same constant transcription rate for both mRNA-X and mRNA-Y. However, due to differences in their engineered untranslated regions, the two mRNA species exhibit different stabilities within the host cell. The degradation of each mRNA follows first-order kinetics. The measured half-life of mRNA-X is 3.0 minutes, while the half-life of mRNA-Y is 21.0 minutes. After a sufficient amount of time, the concentrations of both mRNA species reach a steady-state level.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the steady-state concentration of mRNA-Y to the steady-state concentration of mRNA-X.", "solution": "The concentration of an mRNA species, let's denote it by $[M]$, is governed by its rate of production (transcription) and its rate of degradation. The problem states that the degradation follows first-order kinetics. Therefore, the rate of change of the mRNA concentration can be described by the following differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[M]}{dt} = k_{tx} - k_{deg}[M] $$\nwhere $k_{tx}$ is the constant rate of transcription and $k_{deg}$ is the first-order degradation rate constant.\n\nAt steady state, the concentration of the mRNA no longer changes with time. This means that the rate of production is exactly balanced by the rate of degradation. Mathematically, this corresponds to setting the derivative to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d[M]_{ss}}{dt} = 0 $$\nwhere $[M]_{ss}$ denotes the steady-state concentration.\n\nSubstituting this into our rate equation gives:\n$$ 0 = k_{tx} - k_{deg}[M]_{ss} $$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration, we find:\n$$ [M]_{ss} = \\frac{k_{tx}}{k_{deg}} $$\nThis equation shows that the steady-state concentration of an mRNA is directly proportional to its transcription rate and inversely proportional to its degradation rate constant.\n\nThe problem provides the half-life ($t_{1/2}$) of each mRNA species, not the degradation rate constant ($k_{deg}$). For a first-order decay process, the half-life is related to the rate constant by the well-known formula:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{deg}} $$\nWe can rearrange this to express $k_{deg}$ in terms of $t_{1/2}$:\n$$ k_{deg} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $k_{deg}$ back into our equation for the steady-state concentration:\n$$ [M]_{ss} = \\frac{k_{tx}}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}} = \\frac{k_{tx} \\cdot t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} $$\n\nWe can now apply this general result to our specific case for mRNA-X and mRNA-Y. Let $[X]_{ss}$ and $[Y]_{ss}$ be their respective steady-state concentrations. Let their half-lives be $t_{1/2, X}$ and $t_{1/2, Y}$. The problem states that their transcription rates are identical, so we can use the same symbol $k_{tx}$ for both.\n\nFor mRNA-X:\n$$ [X]_{ss} = \\frac{k_{tx} \\cdot t_{1/2, X}}{\\ln(2)} $$\n\nFor mRNA-Y:\n$$ [Y]_{ss} = \\frac{k_{tx} \\cdot t_{1/2, Y}}{\\ln(2)} $$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $\\frac{[Y]_{ss}}{[X]_{ss}}$. We can compute this by dividing the two expressions:\n$$ \\frac{[Y]_{ss}}{[X]_{ss}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{tx} \\cdot t_{1/2, Y}}{\\ln(2)}}{\\frac{k_{tx} \\cdot t_{1/2, X}}{\\ln(2)}} $$\nThe transcription rate $k_{tx}$ and the constant $\\ln(2)$ cancel out, leaving a simple ratio of the half-lives:\n$$ \\frac{[Y]_{ss}}{[X]_{ss}} = \\frac{t_{1/2, Y}}{t_{1/2, X}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given values: $t_{1/2, X} = 3.0$ minutes and $t_{1/2, Y} = 21.0$ minutes.\n$$ \\frac{[Y]_{ss}}{[X]_{ss}} = \\frac{21.0 \\text{ min}}{3.0 \\text{ min}} = 7.0 $$\nThe ratio of the steady-state concentration of mRNA-Y to that of mRNA-X is 7.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.0}$$", "id": "2050067"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple first-order decay, this practice delves into building more sophisticated models of mRNA degradation.

To quantify this effect, they propose a kinetic model for the expression of a gene. In this model, the gene is transcribed at a constant rate, $k_{tr}$. The resulting mRNA is degraded through a first-order process with a rate constant $k_{deg}$.\n\nThe core of their hypothesis is a model for the degradation rate constant: $k_{deg} = k_{basal} + \\gamma \\cdot N$, where $k_{basal}$ is the basal degradation rate constant for an ideal mRNA with no destabilizing features, $N$ is the total count of certain \"unfavorable\" dicodons within the gene's coding sequence, and $\\gamma$ is an instability coefficient representing the increase in degradation rate per unfavorable dicodon.\n\nTo test this model, the team engineers two synonymous variants of a reporter gene, Variant A and Variant B. Both variants encode the exact same protein, and their transcription is driven by identical promoters, ensuring the transcription rate $k_{tr}$ is the same for both. The variants differ only in their codon usage. After expressing these variants in a host organism, the team measures their steady-state mRNA concentrations and counts their unfavorable dicodons. The experimental data are as follows:\n\n- **Variant A**: Unfavorable Dicodon Count $N_A$, steady-state mRNA concentration $M_A$.\n- **Variant B**: Unfavorable Dicodon Count $N_B$, steady-state mRNA concentration $M_B$.\n\nAssume that $N_A \\neq N_B$ and the model is accurate.
