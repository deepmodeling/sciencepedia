This first exercise explores a hypothetical mutation in the $trpR$ repressor gene, which fundamentally alters its function [@problem_id:2076785]. By predicting the cellular phenotype, you will solidify your understanding of the repressor's role as a molecular switch and the critical importance of the co-repressor, tryptophan, in its normal operation.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a researcher is working with an *Escherichia coli* strain engineered for controlled production of an aromatic compound. The synthesis of this compound relies on a precursor, the amino acid tryptophan, which is produced by the enzymes encoded in the bacterium's native tryptophan (trp) operon. In a wild-type cell, the trp operon is regulated by a repressor protein, TrpR. The *trpR* gene, located elsewhere on the chromosome, codes for this repressor. The TrpR protein, by itself, is inactive. It only becomes active and binds to the operator DNA sequence (*trpO*) when it forms a complex with its co-repressor, tryptophan. This binding prevents transcription of the operon's structural genes (*trpE*, *trpD*, *trpC*, *trpB*, *trpA*).\n\nA spontaneous mutation is identified in the *trpR* gene of the engineered strain. Characterization of the resulting mutant TrpR protein reveals that it has adopted a three-dimensional conformation that allows it to bind to the *trpO* operator site with high affinity, irrespective of the intracellular concentration of tryptophan.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the phenotype of this mutant *E. coli* strain?\n\nA. The cell will constitutively express the trp operon genes, regardless of the presence of tryptophan in the medium, leading to a massive overproduction of tryptophan.\n\nB. The cell will be unable to synthesize its own tryptophan and will require tryptophan to be supplied in the growth medium for survival.\n\nC. The cell's trp operon regulation will be indistinguishable from that of a wild-type cell.\n\nD. The cell will only express the trp operon genes when tryptophan is absent from the growth medium.\n\nE. The expression of the trp operon genes will become highly unstable, randomly switching between \"on\" and \"off\" states independent of tryptophan levels.", "solution": "In the wild-type trp operon, TrpR by itself is an inactive aporepressor that cannot bind the operator DNA sequence *trpO*. When intracellular tryptophan is abundant, tryptophan acts as a co-repressor by binding TrpR, inducing an allosteric conformational change that enables TrpR to bind *trpO* with high affinity and block transcription of the structural genes *trpE*, *trpD*, *trpC*, *trpB*, *trpA*. Thus, in wild type: high tryptophan leads to repressor binding and operon off; low tryptophan leads to repressor not binding and operon on.\n\nThe mutant described produces a TrpR protein that adopts a conformation capable of high-affinity binding to *trpO* irrespective of tryptophan levels. Functionally, this is a constitutively active repressor (co-repressor-independent). Because it binds *trpO* both when tryptophan is present and when it is absent, RNA polymerase is blocked from transcribing the trp structural genes under all conditions. Therefore, the biosynthetic enzymes required for tryptophan synthesis are not produced, preventing endogenous tryptophan synthesis.\n\nConsequently, the strain becomes a tryptophan auxotroph: it cannot synthesize tryptophan and will require exogenous tryptophan for growth. This corresponds to option B. Options A, C, D, and E are inconsistent: A would require a nonfunctional repressor or operator preventing binding (leading to constitutive expression), C would require wild-type regulation, D matches wild type rather than this mutant, and E is not supported by a stable high-affinity DNA-binding phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2076785"}, {"introduction": "The $trp$ operon's elegance lies in its dual-control system of repression and attenuation. This practice moves beyond qualitative descriptions to quantify the power of repression [@problem_id:2076793]. By comparing a wild-type cell to a mutant that lacks repression, you can precisely calculate the contribution of the repressor-operator system to the operon's total dynamic range under specific conditions.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a bioengineer is studying the regulation of the tryptophan (Trp) operon in *Escherichia coli*. The expression of this operon is controlled by two primary mechanisms: repression and attenuation.\n\n1.  **Repression**: In the presence of high intracellular Trp concentrations, the TrpR repressor protein, activated by Trp, binds to the operator site (*trpO*). This binding reduces the transcription initiation rate by a repression factor, $F_{rep}$.\n2.  **Attenuation**: A secondary mechanism involves a leader sequence (*trpL*) that can terminate transcription prematurely. When Trp is abundant, a fraction $f_{term}$ of initiated transcripts are successfully completed, while the rest are terminated. When Trp is scarce, this termination is relieved, and a larger fraction $f_{cont}$ of transcripts are completed.\n\nThe overall rate of synthesis of the Trp-biosynthesis enzymes is directly proportional to the rate of successful transcription of the operon.\n\nThe engineer compares a wild-type (WT) strain to a mutant (MUT) strain. The MUT strain possesses a mutation in the *trpO* site that completely abolishes the binding of the active TrpR-Trp complex, effectively disabling the repression mechanism. Both strains are grown in a medium rich in tryptophan, leading to high intracellular Trp concentrations.\n\nGiven the following parameters for the system:\n- Repression factor, $F_{rep} = 75.0$\n- Completion fraction under high Trp, $f_{term} = 0.12$\n- Completion fraction under low Trp, $f_{cont} = 0.95$\n\nCalculate the ratio of the rate of Trp-biosynthesis enzyme synthesis in the MUT strain to that in the WT strain under these high-tryptophan conditions.

The model describes the dynamic concentrations of three key species: the messenger RNA (mRNA) of a biosynthetic operon, denoted by $M(t)$; a rate-limiting enzyme encoded by the operon, denoted by $P(t)$; and the final metabolic product, denoted by $T(t)$.\n\nThe system's dynamics are governed by the following set of coupled ordinary differential equations:\n\n1.  The rate of change of mRNA concentration, $\\frac{dM}{dt}$, is determined by its synthesis and degradation. Synthesis occurs at a maximum rate $k_{m,max}$, but is downregulated by the product $T$. This negative feedback occurs through two independent molecular mechanisms, analogous to repression and attenuation.
