This practice is a thought experiment designed to solidify your understanding of the foundational mechanism of cap-dependent translation in eukaryotes. By contrasting a conventional linear mRNA with a synthetic circular version, you will reason through why the 5' cap and 3' poly-A tail are indispensable features for efficient protein synthesis.", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is designing two different messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) molecules to produce a specific enzyme in a eukaryotic cell-free translation system. Both mRNA molecules contain the exact same protein-coding sequence.\n\nThe first molecule, `mRNA-Lin`, is a linear strand of mRNA. It is synthesized with a 7-methylguanosine cap on its 5' end and a long poly-adenosine (poly-A) tail on its 3' end, mimicking a mature eukaryotic mRNA.\n\nThe second molecule, `mRNA-Circ`, is a circular strand of RNA. It is created by enzymatically ligating the 5' and 3' ends of the raw coding sequence together. As a result, this molecule has no free ends, and therefore possesses neither a 5' cap nor a 3' poly-A tail.\n\nEqual molar quantities of `mRNA-Lin` and `mRNA-Circ` are independently introduced into identical volumes of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, a solution which contains all the necessary ribosomes, initiation factors, and other components for protein synthesis. The amount of enzyme produced over a fixed period is measured to determine the translation efficiency.\n\nBased on the standard mechanism of translation initiation in eukaryotes, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. The translation efficiency of `mRNA-Circ` will be significantly higher than that of `mRNA-Lin`.\nB. The translation efficiency of `mRNA-Lin` will be significantly higher than that of `mRNA-Circ`.\nC. `mRNA-Lin` and `mRNA-Circ` will have nearly identical translation efficiencies.\nD. Neither `mRNA-Lin` nor `mRNA-Circ` will be translated, as both are synthetic molecules.", "solution": "Define the translation efficiency for a given mRNA as being proportional to its initiation rate, denoted $E \\propto k_{\\text{init}}$. In eukaryotes under standard conditions, $k_{\\text{init}}$ is dominated by cap-dependent scanning. The canonical mechanism requires:\n- Recognition of the 5' cap by the eIF4F complex (eIF4E binds the 7-methylguanosine cap; eIF4G scaffolds other factors).\n- Recruitment of the 43S pre-initiation complex (40S subunit with $eIF2\\text{-}GTP\\text{-}Met\\text{-}tRNA_i$ and other factors) to the 5' end via eIF4F.\n- Enhancement by the 3' poly-A tail through poly-A-binding protein (PABP), which interacts with eIF4G to form a functional closed-loop, increasing $k_{\\text{init}}$.\n- Scanning from the 5' end to the start codon and subsequent joining of the 60S subunit.\n\nFor mRNA-Lin: It possesses both a 5' cap and a 3' poly-A tail. Therefore, eIF4E can bind the cap, eIF4G can bridge to PABP on the poly-A tail, and the 43S pre-initiation complex can be efficiently recruited to the 5' end to initiate scanning. Consequently, $k_{\\text{init,Lin}}$ is high, and thus $E_{\\text{Lin}} \\propto k_{\\text{init,Lin}}$ is large.\n\nFor mRNA-Circ: It lacks a free 5' end and thus has no 5' cap; it also lacks a 3' poly-A tail. Without a 5' cap, eIF4E cannot bind, eIF4F cannot efficiently recruit the 43S complex to an entry site, and the standard 5' end-dependent scanning cannot occur because there is no 5' end for loading. Without a poly-A tail, there is no PABP-mediated enhancement. In the absence of an internal ribosome entry site or other cap-independent initiation elements (not provided in the problem), the initiation rate is expected to be minimal. Hence, $k_{\\text{init,Circ}} \\approx 0$ relative to $k_{\\text{init,Lin}}$, implying $E_{\\text{Circ}} \\ll E_{\\text{Lin}}$.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two,\n$$E_{\\text{Lin}} \\gg E_{\\text{Circ}},$$\nso the translation efficiency of mRNA-Lin will be significantly higher than that of mRNA-Circ.\n\nEliminations:\n- A is incorrect because circular RNA without cap, poly-A, or IRES is not efficiently translated under standard eukaryotic initiation.\n- C is incorrect because the presence of the cap and poly-A in mRNA-Lin creates a large difference in $k_{\\text{init}}$.\n- D is incorrect because synthetic, properly capped and tailed mRNA (like mRNA-Lin) is robustly translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is that mRNA-Lin will be translated far more efficiently than mRNA-Circ.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2078491"}, {"introduction": "While translation ideally begins at the main start codon, the ribosome's scan along the 5' UTR can be intercepted by upstream regulatory elements [@problem_id:2078491]. This problem explores how upstream start codons (uAUGs) can act as decoys, repressing translation of the main protein. By applying a probabilistic model, you will quantify how the length of the 5' UTR directly impacts the final protein expression level, a crucial principle in designing predictable genetic constructs.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is designing two expression constructs, A and B, to produce a reporter protein in a eukaryotic cell line. Both constructs use the same strong promoter and contain identical Coding Sequences (CDS), which is the part of the mRNA that is translated into protein. The only difference between them lies in the length of their 5' Untranslated Region (UTR), the sequence of mRNA upstream of the CDS.\n\nConstruct A features a short 5' UTR with a length $L_A = 25$ nucleotides.\nConstruct B features a long 5' UTR with a length $L_B = 250$ nucleotides.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, model the 5' UTR sequences as random, with each of the four nucleotides (A, U, C, G) having an equal probability of appearing at any position. The efficiency of protein expression is affected by the presence of \"leaky\" upstream start codons (AUG triplets) within the 5' UTR. A scanning ribosome that encounters an upstream AUG will initiate translation at that site and consequently fail to translate the main reporter protein with a probability $p_{init} = 0.55$. If the ribosome does not initiate translation at the upstream AUG, it continues scanning downstream.\n\nAssume the following:\n1. The number of potential, independent sites for an AUG triplet to begin in a UTR of length $L$ can be approximated as $L$.\n2. The final protein expression level is directly proportional to the probability that a ribosome successfully scans the entire 5' UTR without initiating at any of the potential upstream AUG sites.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the final protein expression level from Construct B to that of Construct A, denoted as $\\frac{E_B}{E_A}$.
