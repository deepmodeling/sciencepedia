A reporter gene, encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), is regulated by a promoter that contains a single operator site, $O_g$. The expression of GFP is controlled by a repressor protein, $R$, which is constitutively produced at a total intracellular concentration of $R_{tot}$. When a molecule of $R$ binds to $O_g$, transcription of GFP is completely silenced.\n\nThe activity of the repressor $R$ is modulated by an inducer molecule, $L$. The inducer binds to the repressor in a cooperative manner, described by the reaction $R + nL \\rightleftharpoons RL_n$, where $n$ is the Hill coefficient. The complex $RL_n$ is inactive and cannot bind to any operator site. The dissociation constant for the repressor-inducer interaction is $K_L = \\frac{[R][L]^n}{[RL_n]}$, where $[X]$ denotes the concentration of species $X$.\n\nThe repressor binds to any single operator site ($O$) with a dissociation constant $K_d = \\frac{[R][O]}{[RO]}$.\n\nTo study the system's dynamics, a second plasmid is introduced into the bacterium. This plasmid carries a large number of \"decoy\" operator sites, $O_d$, which are identical in sequence to $O_g$. These decoy sites bind the repressor $R$ with the same affinity but do not regulate any genes. The total concentration of these decoy sites in the cell is $O_{d,tot}$.\n\nWe can make the following assumptions:\n1. The expression level of GFP is directly proportional to the probability that the operator site $O_g$ is unbound.\n2. The concentration of repressor molecules bound to the single gene-regulating operator site $O_g$ is negligible in the cell's overall budget of repressor molecules.\n\nYour task is to determine how these decoy sites affect the sensitivity of the gene circuit to the inducer. Specifically, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the ratio $\\frac{K_{eff, \\text{with decoys}}}{K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}}}$. Here, $K_{eff}$ represents the concentration of inducer $[L]$ required to achieve half of the maximal GFP expression.

Let's denote the gene expression level by $\\alpha$.\n\n**Step 1: Condition for Half-Maximal Expression**\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the expression level $\\alpha$ is proportional to the probability of the genomic operator site $O_g$ being free, let's call this $P(\\text{free})$.\nThe binding of a free repressor molecule $R$ to the operator site $O_g$ is an equilibrium process: $R + O_g \\rightleftharpoons RO_g$. The probability that the operator is free can be expressed using a partition function over the states of the operator (free or bound):\n$$P(\\text{free}) = \\frac{\\text{statistical weight of free state}}{\\text{statistical weight of free state} + \\text{statistical weight of bound state}}$$\nThe statistical weight of the free state is 1. The statistical weight of the bound state is proportional to the concentration of free, active repressor, $[R]$, and inversely proportional to the dissociation constant, $K_d$.

We will use this condition to find the required inducer concentration, $K_{eff}$, in both scenarios.\n\n**Step 2: System without Decoy Sites**\n\nFirst, let's find $K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}}$. In this case, the total concentration of repressor, $R_{tot}$, is distributed between three forms: free active repressor ($[R]$), inducer-bound repressor ($[RL_n]$), and operator-bound repressor ($[RO_g]$).\n$$R_{tot} = [R] + [RL_n] + [RO_g]$$\nBased on assumption 2, the amount of repressor bound to the single genomic operator is negligible compared to the total, so $[RO_g] \\approx 0$.\n$$R_{tot} \\approx [R] + [RL_n]$$\nFrom the definition of the inducer binding equilibrium, we have $[RL_n] = \\frac{[R][L]^n}{K_L}$.\n$$R_{tot} = [R] + \\frac{[R][L]^n}{K_L} = [R]\\left(1 + \\frac{[L]^n}{K_L}\\right)$$\nTo find $K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}}$, we set $[R] = K_d$ and $[L] = K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}}$.\n$$R_{tot} = K_d\\left(1 + \\frac{(K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}})^n}{K_L}\\right)$$\nNow, we solve for $(K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}})^n$:\n$$\\frac{R_{tot}}{K_d} = 1 + \\frac{(K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}})^n}{K_L}$$\n$$\\frac{(K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}})^n}{K_L} = \\frac{R_{tot}}{K_d} - 1$$\n$$(K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}})^n = K_L \\left(\\frac{R_{tot}}{K_d} - 1\\right)$$\n\n**Step 3: System with Decoy Sites**\n\nNow we consider the system with decoy operator sites at a total concentration $O_{d,tot}$. The repressor budget must now also account for repressors bound to these decoy sites, $[RO_d]$.\n$$R_{tot} = [R] + [RL_n] + [RO_g] + [RO_d]$$\nAgain, we neglect $[RO_g]$.\n$$R_{tot} \\approx [R] + [RL_n] + [RO_d]$$\nThe concentration of repressor bound to decoy sites, $[RO_d]$, can be found from the binding equilibrium. The concentration of free decoy sites is $[O_d] = O_{d,tot} - [RO_d]$.\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][O_d]}{[RO_d]} = \\frac{[R](O_{d,tot} - [RO_d])}{[RO_d]}$$\n$$K_d [RO_d] = [R] O_{d,tot} - [R] [RO_d]$$\n$$[RO_d] (K_d + [R]) = [R] O_{d,tot}$$\n$$[RO_d] = \\frac{[R] O_{d,tot}}{K_d + [R]}$$\nSubstituting this and $[RL_n]$ into the repressor budget equation:\n$$R_{tot} = [R]\\left(1 + \\frac{[L]^n}{K_L}\\right) + \\frac{[R] O_{d,tot}}{K_d + [R]}$$\nTo find $K_{eff, \\text{with decoys}}$, we again use the condition $[R] = K_d$ and set $[L] = K_{eff, \\text{with decoys}}$.\n$$R_{tot} = K_d\\left(1 + \\frac{(K_{eff, \\text{with decoys}})^n}{K_L}\\right) + \\frac{K_d O_{d,tot}}{K_d + K_d}$$\n$$R_{tot} = K_d\\left(1 + \\frac{(K_{eff, \\text{with decoys}})^n}{K_L}\\right) + \\frac{K_d O_{d,tot}}{2K_d}$$\n$$R_{tot} = K_d\\left(1 + \\frac{(K_{eff, \\text{with decoys}})^n}{K_L}\\right) + \\frac{O_{d,tot}}{2}$$\nNow, we solve for $(K_{eff, \\text{with decoys}})^n$:\n$$R_{tot} - \\frac{O_{d,tot}}{2} = K_d\\left(1 + \\frac{(K_{eff, \\text{with decoys}})^n}{K_L}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{K_d}\\left(R_{tot} - \\frac{O_{d,tot}}{2}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{(K_{eff, \\text{with decoys}})^n}{K_L}$$\n$$\\frac{(K_{eff, \\text{with decoys}})^n}{K_L} = \\frac{R_{tot}}{K_d} - \\frac{O_{d,tot}}{2K_d} - 1$$\n$$(K_{eff, \\text{with decoys}})^n = K_L \\left(\\frac{R_{tot}}{K_d} - 1 - \\frac{O_{d,tot}}{2K_d}\\right)$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Ratio**\n\nFinally, we compute the desired ratio.
