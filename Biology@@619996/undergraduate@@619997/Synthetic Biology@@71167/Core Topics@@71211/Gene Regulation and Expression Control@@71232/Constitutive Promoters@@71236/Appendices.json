The expression cassette is designed to consist of four key DNA elements in a specific order:\n1.  A strong constitutive promoter ($P_{strong}$) that continuously drives transcription.\n2.  A ribosome binding site (RBS) to initiate translation.\n3.  The coding sequence (CDS) for GFP.\n4.  A transcriptional terminator to end transcription.\n\nThe intended arrangement on the plasmid is: $5' - P_{strong} \\rightarrow RBS \\rightarrow GFP_{CDS} \\rightarrow Terminator - 3'$, where the arrow indicates the direction of transcription initiated by the promoter.\n\nDuring the molecular cloning process, an error occurs. The DNA fragment containing the promoter is accidentally inserted in the reverse orientation relative to the rest of the cassette. The final plasmid construct therefore has the arrangement: $5' - P_{strong} \\leftarrow RBS \\rightarrow GFP_{CDS} \\rightarrow Terminator - 3'$, where the arrows now show the functional orientation of the promoter and the intended direction for the rest of the cassette. All other components (RBS, GFP CDS, Terminator) are correctly placed and oriented. The plasmid is successfully transformed into *E. coli*.\n\nAssuming no other promoters are located nearby on the plasmid backbone that could interfere, what is the expected level of GFP protein expression from this incorrectly assembled plasmid compared to a correctly assembled one?\n\nA. The GFP expression level will be identical to the correctly assembled plasmid.\n\nB. The GFP expression level will be significantly higher than the correctly assembled plasmid.\n\nC. The GFP expression level will be approximately half that of the correctly assembled plasmid.\n\nD. The GFP expression will be effectively zero, or at a level indistinguishable from the background autofluorescence of the host cells.", "solution": "1. Principle of transcription directionality: In bacteria, RNA polymerase binds the promoter and initiates transcription in the promoter’s defined orientation, producing RNA that extends downstream from the promoter. Therefore, to produce a functional mRNA for a given gene, the promoter must be placed upstream of that gene in the same orientation so that the transcribed RNA includes the ribosome binding site (RBS) and the coding sequence (CDS).\n2. Correct assembly outcome: With the arrangement $5' - P_{strong} - RBS - GFP_{CDS} - Terminator - 3'$, transcription initiated at $P_{strong}$ proceeds across the RBS and GFP CDS and terminates at the terminator, yielding an mRNA that contains a functional RBS immediately upstream of the GFP start codon. This mRNA is competent for translation, so GFP is expressed.\n3. Incorrect assembly outcome with reversed promoter: With the promoter inserted in reverse orientation relative to the RBS and CDS, the arrangement is effectively $5' - P_{strong}^{\\text{rev}} \\, \\, \\text{(pointing upstream)} \\, \\, \\ldots RBS - GFP_{CDS} - Terminator - 3'$. Transcription from $P_{strong}$ proceeds in the opposite direction, away from the RBS and GFP CDS. As a result, no mRNA that contains the RBS and GFP CDS in the correct, sense orientation is produced by this promoter.\n4. Antisense and ribosome binding considerations: Any transcript produced in the reverse direction would be antisense relative to the GFP CDS and would not contain a functional Shine–Dalgarno sequence in the correct orientation or spacing upstream of a start codon for the sense GFP reading frame. Bacterial ribosomes do not initiate translation on the reverse complement of an RBS to produce the sense protein. Thus, such antisense transcripts do not yield GFP.\n5. Terminator considerations: The presence of the terminator downstream of the GFP CDS in the intended orientation does not rescue expression when the promoter is reversed, because the promoter does not drive transcription through the RBS and CDS. Under the stated assumption that no other promoters are present nearby on the plasmid backbone, there is no alternative transcription to generate the required mRNA.\n6. Conclusion: With no production of the required mRNA containing the correctly oriented RBS and GFP CDS, the expected GFP protein expression is effectively zero, indistinguishable from host autofluorescence.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2027580"}, {"introduction": "With the principles of genetic part assembly established, we can now move to quantifying the behavior of a correctly built circuit. This exercise [@problem_id:2027599] introduces the foundational mathematical model for constitutive gene expression, treating it as a dynamic balance between constant production and first-order decay. By deriving expressions for the steady-state mRNA concentration and half-life, you will develop the core skills needed to describe and predict the output of simple synthetic constructs.", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, a common building block is a gene expressed from a constitutive promoter. Consider such a system where a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) is being produced. The transcription process, driven by the constitutive promoter, occurs at a constant rate, denoted by $k_{tx}$. Simultaneously, the mRNA molecules are subject to degradation, which is modeled as a first-order process with a rate constant $\\delta_m$. This means the rate of removal of mRNA is directly proportional to its current concentration, $[m]$.\n\nAssuming the system starts with no mRNA, it will eventually reach a stable equilibrium. You are asked to determine two fundamental characteristic parameters of this system. First, find the steady-state concentration of the mRNA, which we will call $[m_{ss}]$. Second, determine the half-life of the mRNA, denoted as $t_{1/2}$, which is defined as the time it takes for a given concentration of mRNA to decrease to half of its initial value in the complete absence of production.\n\nProvide the expressions for the steady-state concentration $[m_{ss}]$ and the half-life $t_{1/2}$, in that order. Your answer should be a pair of symbolic expressions in terms of the given parameters $k_{tx}$ and $\\delta_m$.", "solution": "The problem asks for two quantities: the steady-state mRNA concentration, $[m_{ss}]$, and the mRNA half-life, $t_{1/2}$. We can derive these by first setting up a differential equation that describes the time evolution of the mRNA concentration, $[m]$.\n\nThe rate of change of the mRNA concentration, $\\frac{d[m]}{dt}$, is the difference between its rate of production and its rate of degradation.\n$$\n\\frac{d[m]}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of production}) - (\\text{Rate of degradation})\n$$\nThe problem states that the production rate is a constant, $k_{tx}$. The degradation is a first-order process, meaning its rate is proportional to the concentration $[m]$ with a rate constant $\\delta_m$. Thus, the rate of degradation is $\\delta_m [m]$. Combining these terms gives the governing ordinary differential equation for the system:\n$$\n\\frac{d[m]}{dt} = k_{tx} - \\delta_m [m]\n$$\nTo find the steady-state concentration, $[m_{ss}]$, we look for the condition where the concentration is no longer changing over time. This corresponds to setting the rate of change to zero, $\\frac{d[m]}{dt} = 0$.\n$$\n0 = k_{tx} - \\delta_m [m_{ss}]\n$$\nSolving for $[m_{ss}]$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\n\\delta_m [m_{ss}] = k_{tx}\n$$\n$$\n[m_{ss}] = \\frac{k_{tx}}{\\delta_m}\n$$\nThis is the first part of our answer.\n\nNext, we need to find the half-life, $t_{1/2}$. The half-life is determined by considering only the degradation process, as per the problem definition (\"in the complete absence of production\"). In this scenario, the production rate $k_{tx}$ is zero. The differential equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d[m]}{dt} = - \\delta_m [m]\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order linear differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables:\n$$\n\\frac{d[m]}{[m]} = - \\delta_m dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. Let's integrate from time $t=0$ to a general time $t$, during which the concentration changes from an initial value $[m]_0$ to $[m](t)$.\n$$\n\\int_{[m]_0}^{[m](t)} \\frac{1}{[m']} d[m'] = \\int_{0}^{t} - \\delta_m dt'\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n$$\n\\ln([m](t)) - \\ln([m]_0) = - \\delta_m t\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can write this as:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{[m](t)}{[m]_0}\\right) = - \\delta_m t\n$$\nNow, we apply the definition of half-life, $t_{1/2}$. This is the time $t$ at which the concentration `[m](t)` has fallen to half of its initial value, i.e., $[m](t_{1/2}) = \\frac{[m]_0}{2}$. Substituting this into our equation:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{[m]_0/2}{[m]_0}\\right) = - \\delta_m t_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = - \\delta_m t_{1/2}\n$$\nSince $\\ln(\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\ln(2)$, we have:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = - \\delta_m t_{1/2}\n$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$ yields:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta_m}\n$$\nThis is the second part of our answer.
