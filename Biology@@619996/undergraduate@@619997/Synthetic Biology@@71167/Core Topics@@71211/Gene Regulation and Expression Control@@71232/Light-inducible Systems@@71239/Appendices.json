For a light-inducible system, the most fundamental metric is the induction ratio, which tells us how effectively the switch turns 'ON' from its 'OFF' state.

The core of the switch is a protein containing a Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domain, which controls transcription.\n\nTo quantify the performance of this switch, three fluorescence measurements are taken using a flow cytometer, which measures the fluorescence intensity of individual cells:\n1.  A control sample of *E. coli* that does not contain the GFP-expressing plasmid is analyzed to determine the baseline cellular autofluorescence. The average fluorescence intensity per cell from this sample is denoted as $F_{bg}$.\n2.  A sample of *E. coli* containing the light-activated circuit is kept in complete darkness. The average fluorescence intensity per cell is measured to be $F_{dark}$. This value represents the sum of the cellular autofluorescence and any fluorescence from \"leaky\" (uninduced) expression of GFP.\n3.  Another sample of *E. coli* with the circuit is exposed to saturating blue light, leading to maximal activation of GFP expression. The average fluorescence intensity per cell is measured to be $F_{light}$. This value represents the sum of the cellular autofluorescence and the fluorescence from the fully induced expression of GFP.\n\nThe induction ratio of the switch is a key performance metric, defined as the ratio of the true signal from GFP in the light-induced state to the true signal from GFP in the dark (leaky) state.

The system utilizes a photoreceptor protein, based on a Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domain, that can exist in either an inactive state or a light-activated state. In its active state, the photoreceptor promotes the expression of a fluorescent reporter protein.\n\nThe dynamics of the system following a brief, intense pulse of activating light at time $t=0$ can be modeled by the following set of assumptions:\n1.  At $t=0$, the light pulse instantaneously converts a certain amount of the inactive photoreceptor to its active form. Let the concentration of the active photoreceptor at any time $t \\ge 0$ be denoted by $A(t)$.\n2.

The core of this circuit is a photoreceptor protein `P`, whose gene is located on a multi-copy plasmid. The expression of `P` is constitutive, leading to a total intracellular concentration of this protein, `[P]_{total}`, that is directly proportional to the plasmid copy number, `N`, in that specific cell. This relationship is given by `[P]_{total} = c_p N`, where `c_p` is a constant that encapsulates the rates of protein production and dilution.\n\nUpon exposure to blue light of intensity `L`, the protein `P` undergoes a conformational change to become an active transcription factor, `A`. This conversion is reversible, and at steady state under constant illumination, the concentration of the active form `[A]` is described by the Michaelis-Menten-like relation:\n$$ [A] = [P]_{total} \\frac{L}{K_L + L} $$\nwhere `K_L` is the light-activation constant, representing the light intensity at which half of the photoreceptors are in the active state `A`.\n\nTo create a sharp, switch-like response, the system includes a \"titration\" module. The bacterial chromosome constitutively expresses a repressor protein `R` at a constant concentration `[R]_{total} = R_0`. The active transcription factor `A` binds with very high affinity to the repressor `R`, forming an inactive complex. This sequestration is assumed to be perfectly stoichiometric, meaning that free, functional activator `[A]_{free}` is available to bind to its target promoter only after all repressor molecules have been titrated. Consequently, the concentration of free activator is given by `[A]_{free} = [A] - R_0` if `[A] > R_0`, and `[A]_{free} = 0` otherwise. The cell's reporter gene is considered to be in the \"ON\" state if and only if `[A]_{free} > 0`.\n\nA population of these engineered cells, exhibiting cell-to-cell variability in the plasmid copy number `N`, is cultured under uniform and constant illumination `L = L_0`. This results in a bimodal population response, where cells with a low plasmid copy number remain \"OFF\" and cells with a high plasmid copy number switch to \"ON\". Determine the critical plasmid copy number, `N_{crit}`, which represents the minimum number of plasmids a cell must contain to be in the \"ON\" state under these conditions.
