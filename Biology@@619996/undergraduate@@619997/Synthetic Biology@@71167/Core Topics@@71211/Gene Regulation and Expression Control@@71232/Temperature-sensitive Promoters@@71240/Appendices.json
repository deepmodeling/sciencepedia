This first practice invites you to model the 'turn-on' dynamics of a genetic circuit.

The circuit consists of a plasmid carrying a gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), whose expression is controlled by a temperature-sensitive promoter.

When the culture is shifted to an induction temperature, the promoter becomes fully and instantaneously \"on.\"\n\nLet $[G]$ represent the intracellular concentration of GFP molecules. When the promoter is active, GFP is produced at a constant rate $k_p$. The GFP molecules are cleared from the cell via two independent first-order processes: active enzymatic degradation with a rate constant $k_d$, and dilution due to cell division with an effective rate constant equal to the specific growth rate, $\\mu$. Both $k_d$ and $\\mu$ are assumed to be constant throughout the experiment.\n\nAt time $t=0$, a culture of these engineered bacteria, which has been growing at the permissive temperature and has no initial GFP (i.e., $[G](0) = 0$), is rapidly shifted to the induction temperature.
