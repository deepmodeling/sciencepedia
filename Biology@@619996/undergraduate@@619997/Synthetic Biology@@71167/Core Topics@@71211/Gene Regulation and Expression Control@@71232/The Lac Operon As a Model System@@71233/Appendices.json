This practice problem explores this fundamental concept using a classic partial diploid scenario.

[@problem_id:1473290]", "problem": "A bioengineering student is designing a synthetic gene circuit in *Escherichia coli* to control the production of an enzyme. The student creates a partial diploid strain of *E. coli* using an F' plasmid. The genotype of the bacterial chromosome is $I^+ O^+ Z^-$, while the genotype of the F' plasmid is $I^- O^+ Z^+$.\n\nThe components of this system are defined as follows:\n- The *lacI* gene ($I$) codes for a repressor protein. The allele $I^+$ produces a functional repressor, while $I^-$ produces a non-functional repressor.\n- The operator ($O$) is a segment of DNA to which the repressor protein binds. The allele $O^+$ is a normal operator site.\n- The *lacZ* gene ($Z$) codes for the enzyme β-galactosidase. The allele $Z^+$ produces functional β-galactosidase, while $Z^-$ produces a non-functional version of the enzyme.\n\nThe repressor protein binds to the operator to block transcription. Lactose (or its metabolite, allolactose) can bind to the functional repressor protein, causing a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator.\n\nBased on this genetic arrangement, which of the following statements correctly describes the production of functional β-galactosidase in this partial diploid cell?\n\nA. Functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, and this synthesis is inducible by lactose.\n\nB. Functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, but its synthesis is constitutive (occurs regardless of the presence of lactose).\n\nC. No functional β-galactosidase is synthesized under any condition.\n\nD. No functional β-galactosidase is synthesized because the functional repressor protein produced from the $I^+$ allele can only act on the adjacent $Z^-$ gene on the chromosome.\n\nE. Functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, but only in the absence of lactose.", "solution": "The chromosomal genotype is $I^+ O^+ Z^-$ and the F' plasmid genotype is $I^- O^+ Z^+$. The molecular logic of the lac system required here is as follows: the product of *lacI* (the LacI repressor) is a trans-acting diffusible protein; the operator $O$ is a cis-acting DNA site; a functional repressor (from $I^+$) binds to an $O^+$ operator to block transcription; lactose (or allolactose) binds a functional repressor to prevent its operator binding and thereby induces transcription. The $Z^+$ allele produces functional beta-galactosidase when transcribed, whereas $Z^-$ cannot produce functional enzyme.\n\nFrom $I^+ O^+ Z^-$ on the chromosome, a functional LacI repressor is produced. Because LacI is trans-acting, the repressor diffuses and can bind to any $O^+$ operator in the cell, including both the chromosomal $O^+$ and the plasmid $O^+$. The plasmid $I^-$ produces no functional repressor and does not interfere (there is no dominant negative specified). Therefore, in the absence of lactose, the functional repressor from $I^+$ binds both $O^+$ sites and blocks transcription from both operons. Under these conditions, the chromosomal $Z^-$ cannot produce functional enzyme regardless, and the plasmid $Z^+$ is repressed, so no functional beta-galactosidase is synthesized.\n\nIn the presence of lactose (or allolactose), the inducer binds the functional LacI repressor and prevents its binding to $O^+$. With the operators unoccupied, transcription proceeds from both operons. The chromosomal $Z^-$ still cannot produce functional enzyme, but the plasmid $Z^+$ is transcribed and translated into functional beta-galactosidase. Thus, functional enzyme is synthesized only when lactose is present, i.e., synthesis is inducible.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that functional beta-galactosidase is synthesized, and this synthesis is inducible by lactose. This matches option A and rules out: B (would require $O^c$ or no functional *lacI* protein), C (contradicted by inducible expression from $Z^+$ on the plasmid), D (incorrectly asserts the repressor acts only in cis), and E (inverted regulation).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1473290"}, {"introduction": "The modular nature of the lac operon's components makes them ideal for building synthetic circuits. This exercise examines a system with a 'super-repressor' ($I^s$), a mutant LacI protein that can bind to the operator but not to the inducer. By predicting the expression of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter, you'll see how modifying a single protein domain can create a non-inducible, or permanently 'off', system, a valuable tool in synthetic biology. [@problem_id:2075968]", "problem": "A synthetic biologist engineers a strain of *Escherichia coli* to act as a biosensor. The design is based on the well-studied lactose (lac) operon. The engineered strain contains a plasmid with a synthetic operon where the structural genes of the lac operon have been replaced by a gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The expression of GFP is under the control of a standard *lac* promoter and operator (*lacO*) sequence.\n\nThe chromosome of this host *E. coli* strain has been modified. Its native *lacI* gene has been replaced with a mutant allele, denoted $lacI^s$. This $lacI^s$ allele produces a mutant LacI repressor protein (LacI$^s$). The LacI$^s$ protein functions differently from the wild-type LacI protein: it can bind normally and tightly to the *lacO* operator site, but its allosteric site for the inducer is non-functional, meaning it cannot bind to Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), a common molecular analog of allolactose.\n\nThe engineered cells are cultured in two different environments to test their response:\n- **Medium 1**: A minimal medium containing glucose as the primary carbon source.\n- **Medium 2**: A minimal medium containing glycerol as the primary carbon source, supplemented with a high concentration of IPTG.\n\nFor context, recall that glucose metabolism leads to catabolite repression, which suppresses lac operon expression even in the presence of an inducer. Glycerol does not cause catabolite repression.\n\nBased on your understanding of gene regulation, predict the phenotype of the engineered *E. coli* in these two conditions. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected levels of GFP expression?\n\nA. GFP expression will be at a basal level in Medium 1 and high in Medium 2.\n\nB.

GFP expression will be high in Medium 1 and at a basal level in Medium 2.\n\nE. GFP expression will be at a basal level in Medium 1 and at an intermediate level in Medium 2.", "solution": "1) Core regulatory architecture:\n- The synthetic operon uses the standard lac promoter-operator module. Transcription is negatively regulated by repressor binding at the operator (*lacO*) and positively influenced by the cAMP-CRP complex when catabolite repression is relieved. Thus, transcriptional output is high only when the repressor is not bound to *lacO* and when cAMP-CRP is present; it is basal when the repressor is bound to *lacO* (tight repression with possible minimal leak), regardless of the cAMP-CRP state.\n- Wild-type LacI is inactivated by inducer (e.g., IPTG), which prevents it from binding *lacO*. In contrast, the $lacI^s$ (superrepressor) allele produces a repressor that binds *lacO* but cannot bind inducer. Therefore, the LacI$^s$ protein keeps the operator occupied irrespective of inducer concentration.\n\n2) Consequence of $lacI^s$ on the plasmid-borne lac promoter:\n- The chromosomally expressed LacI$^s$ protein diffuses and binds the plasmid’s *lacO*, maintaining repression.\n- Because LacI$^s$ cannot bind IPTG, no inducer can relieve repression; the repressor remains operator-bound in all tested environments.\n\n3) Effects of carbon sources and catabolite repression:\n- Medium 1 (glucose): Catabolite repression lowers cAMP, reducing CRP activation. Even if the repressor were absent, expression would be low. With LacI$^s$ bound at *lacO*, transcription is repressed to basal leak.\n- Medium 2 (glycerol + IPTG): Glycerol does not cause catabolite repression, so cAMP-CRP is active and could enhance transcription if the operator were free. However, IPTG cannot inactivate LacI$^s$, so the operator remains occupied and transcription remains at basal leak.\n\n4) Predicted GFP phenotypes:\n- Medium 1: Basal expression due to repressor binding and catabolite repression.\n- Medium 2: Basal expression due to persistent LacI$^s$ binding despite high IPTG; activation by cAMP-CRP cannot overcome an occupied operator.\n\nTherefore, GFP expression is at a basal level in both conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2075968"}, {"introduction": "To engineer biological systems predictably, we must move beyond qualitative descriptions to quantitative models.
