The plasmid contains a multiple cloning site with a unique recognition site for the restriction enzyme XbaI. The gene of interest has been amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and is flanked by recognition sites for the restriction enzyme SpeI.\n\nThe enzymes have the following recognition sequences and cut patterns, where the arrow (↓) indicates the cleavage site of the phosphodiester bond on each strand of the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA):\n\n-   **XbaI**:\n    5'-T↓C T A G A-3'\n    3'-A G A T C↑T-5'\n\n-   **SpeI**:\n    5'-A↓C T A G T-3'\n    3'-T G A T C↑A-5'\n\nAssume the researcher digests the plasmid vector with XbaI and the DNA fragment containing the gene of interest with SpeI.

Ligation is possible, creating a new junction sequence that can be digested by SpeI but not by XbaI.\n\nE. Ligation is possible, but the newly formed junction sequence cannot be digested by either XbaI or SpeI.", "solution": "To determine the outcome of the ligation, we must first analyze the single-stranded overhangs, or \"sticky ends,\" produced by each restriction enzyme digestion.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the cut made by XbaI on the plasmid vector.\nThe recognition sequence for XbaI is 5'-TCTAGA-3'. The enzyme cuts between the first T and the first C on the top strand, and between the T and the C on the bottom strand.\nThe double-stranded sequence is:\n5'-...T C T A G A...-3'\n3'-...A G A T C T...-5'\n\nAfter digestion with XbaI, the DNA is cleaved as follows:\n5'-...T-3' and 5'-C T A G A...-3'\n3'-...A G A T C-5' and 3'-T...-5'\n\nThis creates a 4-nucleotide single-stranded overhang on the 5' end. The sequence of the overhang is 5'-CTAG-3'.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the cut made by SpeI on the gene fragment.\nThe recognition sequence for SpeI is 5'-ACTAGT-3'. The enzyme cuts between the A and the C on the top strand, and between the T and the C on the bottom strand.\nThe double-stranded sequence is:\n5'-...A C T A G T...-3'\n3'-...T G A T C A...-5'\n\nAfter digestion with SpeI, the DNA is cleaved as follows:\n5'-...A-3' and 5'-C T A G T...-3'\n3'-...T G A T C-5' and 3'-A...-5'\n\nThis also creates a 4-nucleotide single-stranded overhang on the 5' end. The sequence of this overhang is 5'-CTAG-3'.\n\nStep 3: Determine if ligation is possible.\nLigation of sticky ends requires the single-stranded overhangs to be complementary. The overhang on the XbaI-digested vector is 5'-CTAG-3'. The overhang on the SpeI-digested insert is also 5'-CTAG-3'. The complementary sequence to 5'-CTAG-3' is 3'-GATC-5'. When the vector's 5'-CTAG-3' overhang meets the insert's 5'-CTAG-3' overhang, they are not directly ligated. Instead, the overhang of one fragment (e.g., vector's 5'-CTAG-3') anneals with the complementary overhang generated at the other end of the cut site on the other fragment. Let's look at the two ends that will be joined:\n\nVector end:\n5'-...T\n3'-...A G A T C-5'\n\nInsert end:\n          5'-C T A G T...-3'\n                    A...-3'\n\nThe single-stranded overhang on the vector is 5'-CTAG-3', and its complementary strand is 3'-GATC-5'. The overhang on the insert is also 5'-CTAG-3'. These two overhangs are identical and therefore perfectly complementary to each other's template strands. They can anneal via hydrogen bonds:\n\n5'-...T       C T A G T...-3'\n3'-...A G A T C       A...-3'\n\nThe overhangs base-pair as follows: C with G, T with A, A with T, and G with C. Since the overhangs are identical (5'-CTAG-3'), they are compatible for ligation. DNA ligase can then form phosphodiester bonds to seal the nicks in the sugar-phosphate backbone. Thus, ligation is possible. This eliminates option A.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the newly formed junction sequence.\nAfter ligation, the new double-stranded sequence at the junction will be:\n5'-...T C T A G T...-3'\n3'-...A G A T C A...-5'\n\nThe sequence across the ligation junction on the top strand is 5'-TCTAGT-3'.\n\nStep 5: Determine if the new junction site is digestible by XbaI or SpeI.\nWe compare the new sequence, 5'-TCTAGT-3', to the recognition sequences of the original enzymes.\n-   XbaI recognition sequence: 5'-TCTAGA-3'. The new sequence 5'-TCTAGT-3' differs at the last base (T instead of A). Therefore, the new site cannot be digested by XbaI.\n-   SpeI recognition sequence: 5'-ACTAGT-3'. The new sequence 5'-TCTAGT-3' differs at the first base (T instead of A). Therefore, the new site cannot be digested by SpeI.\n\nConclusion: The ligation is possible, but the resulting junction site is a \"scar\" sequence that is no longer recognized by either XbaI or SpeI. This means the ligation is irreversible by restriction digestion with these two enzymes.\n\nThis corresponds to option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2031106"}, {"introduction": "Molecular cloning doesn't end when the ligation is complete; verification is a critical final step. This practice problem [@problem_id:2031094] puts you in the role of a lab detective, tasked with interpreting the results of a diagnostic digest to troubleshoot a cloning experiment. Learning to decipher these molecular clues by analyzing band patterns on a gel is an indispensable skill for confirming success and diagnosing common issues like empty vector contamination.", "problem": "A student in a synthetic biology lab is tasked with constructing a recombinant plasmid. The goal is to insert a gene of interest, `geneX`, into a cloning vector, `pVector`.\n\nThe `pVector` plasmid is 5.0 kilobases (kb) in size and carries a gene for ampicillin resistance. The cloning strategy involves using two different restriction enzymes, `Enz_A` and `Enz_B`, which cut at distinct sites within a multiple cloning site on `pVector`.\n\nThe `geneX` fragment is 1.5 kb long and has been prepared with ends compatible with the `Enz_A` and `Enz_B` restriction sites, ensuring directional insertion.\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows:\n1.  Both `pVector` and the `geneX` DNA fragment are digested with `Enz_A` and `Enz_B`.\n2.  The digested vector and insert are joined using DNA ligase.\n3.  The ligation mixture is used to transform competent *E. coli* cells.\n4.  The transformed cells are plated on Luria Broth (LB) agar containing ampicillin to select for cells that have taken up a plasmid.\n5.  A single colony is selected, cultured in liquid media, and the plasmid DNA is isolated.\n\nTo verify the assembly, a diagnostic digest is performed on the isolated plasmid DNA using a third restriction enzyme, `Enz_C`. The original `pVector` has exactly one recognition site for `Enz_C`. The `geneX` insert also contains exactly one recognition site for `Enz_C`. A successful `pVector-geneX` construct would therefore have a total size of 6.5 kb and would be cut into two linear fragments by `Enz_C`.\n\nUpon analyzing the products of the `Enz_C` diagnostic digest via gel electrophoresis, the student observes the two expected fragments corresponding to a successful 6.5 kb construct. However, a third, distinct, and prominent band is also observed at a size of 5.0 kb.\n\nWhich of the following statements represent plausible explanations for the presence of this unexpected 5.0 kb band? Select all that apply.\n\nA. The *E. coli* colony selected for plasmid purification was a mixed population, containing both cells with the correct construct and cells with an empty `pVector`.\n\nB. A portion of the `pVector` plasmid was not digested at all during the initial cloning steps and was carried through the transformation.\n\nC. The `geneX` insert ligated into the vector in the incorrect orientation.\n\nD. During the initial cloning, a significant fraction of the `pVector` plasmid was only digested by one of the two enzymes (`Enz_A` or `Enz_B`), allowing it to re-circularize during the ligation step.\n\nE. The diagnostic enzyme, `Enz_C`, exhibited \"star activity\" and non-specifically cleaved the correctly assembled 6.5 kb plasmid to produce a 5.0 kb fragment.", "solution": "We analyze the diagnostic digest outcome using the principle that a circular DNA molecule cut by a restriction enzyme at $n$ unique sites yields exactly $n$ linear fragments whose sizes sum to the total plasmid length.\n\nGiven:\n- The correctly assembled plasmid has total size $6.5$ kb (vector $5.0$ kb plus insert $1.5$ kb).\n- The diagnostic enzyme Enz\\_C cuts the original vector once and the insert once; hence, for the correct construct, Enz\\_C makes $n=2$ cuts, producing exactly two fragments whose sizes sum to $6.5$ kb.\n- The student observes the two expected bands for the correct construct plus an unexpected, prominent band at $5.0$ kb.\n\nA $5.0$ kb band is precisely the size of the empty vector linearized by a single cut at its unique Enz\\_C site. Therefore, the most direct interpretation is that some empty vector plasmid is present in the plasmid preparation, coexisting with the correctly assembled $6.5$ kb plasmid. We now evaluate each option for plausibility in producing empty vector DNA in the prep or otherwise creating a $5.0$ kb band while still observing the two expected bands from the correct construct.\n\nOption A: The colony was a mixed population containing cells with the correct construct and cells with empty vector. This is plausible: either two closely spaced colonies were picked together, or a single colony arose from two cells. Plasmid prep from such a mixed culture would contain both plasmids. Upon Enz\\_C digest, the correct construct yields the two expected fragments totaling $6.5$ kb, and the empty vector yields a single linear $5.0$ kb fragment. Hence A is plausible.\n\nOption B: A portion of the vector was not digested at all during initial cloning and was carried through transformation. Uncut, circular vector transforms efficiently, producing empty-vector transformants. A picked colony can, by co-transformation or mixed picking, yield cells harboring empty vector along with cells carrying the correct construct, or even single cells harboring a mixture of plasmid molecules. The resulting plasmid prep would contain empty vector, which after Enz\\_C digest gives a $5.0$ kb band, alongside the two expected bands from the correct construct. Hence B is plausible.\n\nOption C: The insert ligated in the incorrect orientation. With a directional two-enzyme cloning strategy (distinct Enz\\_A and Enz\\_B ends), incorrect orientation is strongly disfavored. More importantly, an orientation flip would change the distances between Enz\\_C sites, altering the expected fragment sizes. Since the gel shows the two expected fragment sizes for the correct construct, this contradicts an orientation error. Moreover, an orientation error would not specifically produce an extra $5.0$ kb band; it would still yield exactly two fragments summing to $6.5$ kb, but of different sizes. Hence C is not a plausible explanation for the extra $5.0$ kb band.\n\nOption D: A significant fraction of vector was only cut by one of the two enzymes, allowing it to re-circularize during ligation. Partial digestion (single-enzyme cut) can religate to regenerate empty vector, which transforms efficiently. This again yields empty vector in the population. After Enz\\_C digest, empty vector gives a $5.0$ kb band, coexisting with the two expected bands from the correct construct. Hence D is plausible.\n\nOption E: Enz\\_C exhibited star activity and non-specifically cleaved the correctly assembled plasmid to produce a $5.0$ kb fragment. Star activity introduces additional, off-target cuts. If star activity occurred broadly, at least one of the expected fragments would be further cleaved, reducing or eliminating the intact expected bands. The observation explicitly states that the two expected bands for the correct construct are present, with an additional prominent $5.0$ kb band. It is unlikely that star activity would reproducibly generate a fragment exactly matching $5.0$ kb while leaving the expected bands intact; mixtures of normally and aberrantly cut molecules could in principle occur, but the precise match to the empty vector size and the presence of intact expected bands make star activity an implausible explanation relative to empty-vector contamination. Hence E is not a plausible explanation in this context.\n\nTherefore, the plausible explanations are those that yield empty vector in the prep while also allowing the correct construct to be present: A, B, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2031094"}]}
