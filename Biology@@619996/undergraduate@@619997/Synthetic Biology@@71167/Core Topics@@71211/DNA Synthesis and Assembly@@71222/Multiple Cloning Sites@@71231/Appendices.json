A critical component of this vector is the Multiple Cloning Site (MCS), a short, engineered segment of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) that contains a high density of unique restriction enzyme recognition sites. This allows for the easy insertion of foreign DNA into the plasmid.\n\nThe design specifications require an 18 base-pair (bp) MCS that contains recognition sites for exactly three **distinct** and **non-overlapping** 6-bp cutting restriction enzymes. The sequence of the MCS must be written in the 5' to 3' direction.\n\nThe available restriction enzymes and their corresponding 5' to 3' recognition sequences are:\n- BamHI: `GGATCC`\n- EcoRI: `GAATTC`\n- HindIII: `AAGCTT`\n- BglII: `AGATCT`\n- PstI: `CTGCAG`\n\nWhich one of the following 18-bp DNA sequences satisfies all the design criteria for the MCS?\n\nA. `AAGGATCCCTGCAGATCT`\n\nB. `GAATTCAGCTAGAAGCTT`\n\nC. `GAATTCGGATCCAAGCTT`\n\nD. `GAATTCGGATACAAGCTT`\n\nE. `GAATTCGAATTCAAGCTT`", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify which of the given 18-base-pair (bp) DNA sequences serves as a valid Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) according to a specific set of rules. The rules are:\n1.  The sequence must be exactly 18 bp long.\n2.  It must contain recognition sites for exactly three **distinct** (unique) restriction enzymes from the provided list.\n3.  The recognition sites must be **non-overlapping**.\n\nThe provided 6-bp recognition sites are:\n- BamHI: `GGATCC`\n- EcoRI: `GAATTC`\n- HindIII: `AAGCTT`\n- BglII: `AGATCT`\n- PstI: `CTGCAG`\n\nAll proposed options are 18 bp long, so the first condition is met by all. We must now analyze each option against the remaining two conditions. We will scan each sequence for the presence of the listed 6-bp sites.\n\n**Analysis of Option A: `AAGGATCCCTGCAGATCT`**\n- We scan the sequence for matches.\n- The subsequence `GGATCC` is found starting at base 3.

This is a **BglII** site.\nThis sequence contains three distinct sites: BamHI (bases 3-8), PstI (bases 9-14), and BglII (bases 13-18). However, the PstI site (`CTGCAG`) occupies bases 9 through 14, and the BglII site (`AGATCT`) occupies bases 13 through 18. These two sites share bases 13 and 14 (`AG`). Therefore, the sites are **overlapping**.

This is an **EcoRI** site.\n- The subsequence `AAGCTT` is found starting at base 13. This is a **HindIII** site.\n- The central subsequence `AGCTAG` does not match any of the provided recognition sites.\nThis sequence contains only two restriction sites (EcoRI and HindIII).

This is an **EcoRI** site (bases 1-6).\n- The subsequence `GGATCC` is found starting at base 7. This is a **BamHI** site (bases 7-12).\n- The subsequence `AAGCTT` is found starting at base 13. This is a **HindIII** site (bases 13-18).\nThis sequence contains three sites: EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII. These three sites are **distinct**. The sites occupy base ranges [1, 6], [7, 12], and [13, 18], which are perfectly sequential and do not share any bases. Therefore, the sites are **non-overlapping**. This sequence satisfies all the design criteria.\n\n**Analysis of Option D: `GAATTCGGATACAAGCTT`**\n- We scan the sequence for matches.\n- The subsequence `GAATTC` is found starting at base 1. This is an **EcoRI** site.\n- The subsequence `AAGCTT` is found starting at base 13. This is a **HindIII** site.\n- The central subsequence `GGATAC` is very similar to the BamHI site (`GGATCC`) but differs by a single base (C vs. A at the fifth position). Therefore, `GGATAC` is not a valid BamHI recognition site.\nThis sequence contains only two restriction sites (EcoRI and HindIII).

This is an **EcoRI** site.\n- The subsequence `GAATTC` is found again, starting at base 7. This is a second **EcoRI** site.\n- The subsequence `AAGCTT` is found starting at base 13. This is a **HindIII** site.\nThis sequence contains three non-overlapping restriction sites. However, the sites are EcoRI, EcoRI, and HindIII. Since the EcoRI site is repeated, there are only two **distinct** types of sites.

This problem presents a classic outcome in blue-white screening, requiring you to deduce the underlying molecular events that lead to a failed cloning experiment [@problem_id:2050268]. Developing this diagnostic mindset is crucial for becoming an effective troubleshooter.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is performing a gene cloning experiment. The goal is to insert a gene for a red fluorescent protein into a commercially available plasmid vector, `pVector_1`. The `pVector_1` plasmid is 4.5 kilobases (kb) in size and carries an ampicillin resistance gene (`AmpR`) for selection. It also contains a Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) strategically placed within the coding sequence of the `lacZα` gene fragment, which allows for blue-white color screening.\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows:\n1. Both the `pVector_1` plasmid and the DNA containing the red fluorescent protein gene are digested to completion using the single restriction enzyme `HindIII`.\n2. The digested plasmid and the gene insert are mixed together in a tube with DNA ligase to join the DNA fragments.\n3. The resulting ligation mixture is used to transform a competent *Escherichia coli* strain that is deficient in the `lacZ` gene and sensitive to ampicillin.\n4. The transformed bacteria are then plated on an agar medium containing ampicillin, Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce gene expression, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as a chromogenic substrate.\n\nAfter overnight incubation, the student observes a large number of bacterial colonies growing on the plate. However, to their surprise, almost all of the colonies are blue, with only a very small fraction being white.\n\nGiven this outcome, select the single most probable molecular event that accounts for the overwhelming majority of blue colonies.\n\nA. The red fluorescent protein gene was successfully inserted, but it is not expressed, causing the colonies to remain blue.\n\nB. The `pVector_1` plasmid was not fully digested by `HindIII` and the majority of transformed plasmids were the original, uncut supercoiled DNA.\n\nC. The `HindIII`-digested `pVector_1` plasmid ligated back onto itself, re-forming the original circular plasmid without the gene insert.\n\nD. The `lacZα` gene on the plasmid underwent a gain-of-function mutation, causing enhanced production of the blue pigment.\n\nE. The bacteria were transformed only with the linear DNA of the red fluorescent protein gene, which integrated into the bacterial chromosome at the `lacZ` locus.\n\nF. The red fluorescent protein gene was ligated into the plasmid in the inverted (antisense) orientation.", "solution": "Principle of blue-white screening: The plasmid carries lacZ alpha with an MCS inside its coding region. In a host providing the omega fragment, a plasmid with an intact lacZ alpha complements to form functional beta-galactosidase, which cleaves X-gal to yield blue colonies under IPTG induction. If an insert is cloned into the MCS, it disrupts lacZ alpha, preventing complementation and producing white colonies. Ampicillin selects for cells carrying any plasmid.\n\nObservation: Most colonies are blue. Therefore, in the majority of transformants, lacZ alpha remained intact, meaning the MCS was not disrupted by the insert.\n\nEvaluate options against this principle:\n- A: If the red fluorescent protein gene were successfully inserted into the MCS, lacZ alpha would be disrupted regardless of whether the red gene is expressed. That would yield white colonies. Therefore A cannot explain blue colonies.\n- B: If the plasmid were not fully digested, residual supercoiled, uncut plasmid would transform with very high efficiency and produce blue colonies because lacZ alpha is intact. While this can contribute to blue background, the stated procedure specifies digestion to completion. Even when digestion is complete, a high fraction of blue colonies commonly arises due to vector self-ligation after single-enzyme digestion, making option C the more probable explanation given standard cloning outcomes.\n- C: After complete HindIII digestion, the vector has compatible cohesive ends that can ligate to each other without the insert, re-circularizing the plasmid and restoring the original lacZ alpha reading frame and MCS. This self-ligation is common when using a single restriction enzyme and when the vector is not dephosphorylated, and it yields blue colonies. This mechanism remains highly probable even with complete digestion and is a classic cause of overwhelming blue colonies.\n- D: A gain-of-function mutation in lacZ alpha in most colonies is extraordinarily unlikely and cannot explain the overwhelming majority.\n- E: Transformation with linear insert DNA alone would not confer ampicillin resistance, would be degraded in Escherichia coli, and chromosomal integration at lacZ without specialized recombineering is exceedingly rare; this cannot account for many blue AmpR colonies.\n- F: Inversion of the insert orientation still disrupts lacZ alpha and would produce white colonies. Orientation affects expression of the red gene but not the blue-white readout.\n\nConclusion: The single most probable molecular event leading to the overwhelming majority of blue colonies is vector self-ligation after single-enzyme digestion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2050268"}, {"introduction": "The final, critical step in any cloning workflow is verification: you must confirm that the DNA you have is what you think you have.

By analyzing the DNA fragments on a gel, you will practice the essential skill of using experimental evidence to reveal the true structure of your plasmid.", "problem": "A bioengineering student is working with a circular plasmid vector named `pMOD1`, which is designed for expressing custom proteins in bacteria. The total size of the `pMOD1` plasmid is 7.5 kilobases (kb). According to the manufacturer's provided sequence map, the vector contains a Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) that has a single, unique recognition site for the restriction enzyme `HindIII`.\n\nTo verify the integrity of the plasmid stock before a cloning experiment, the student performs a single-enzyme diagnostic digest. A sample of the `pMOD1` plasmid is incubated with the `HindIII` enzyme under optimal conditions. The student expects to see a single band at 7.5 kb when the product is analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis, corresponding to the fully linearized plasmid.\n\nHowever, after running the gel, the student observes two distinct and sharp DNA bands. The size of these bands are determined to be 4.5 kb and 3.0 kb. Assuming there are no issues with the student's technique, the buffers, or the gel electrophoresis process, which of the following is the most logical conclusion that can be drawn from this result?\n\nA. The digestion by `HindIII` failed, and the two observed bands correspond to the supercoiled and nicked circular forms of the uncut `pMOD1` plasmid.\n\nB. The `pMOD1` plasmid stock is contaminated with a second, unrelated plasmid of size 4.5 kb which also contains a `HindIII` site.\n\nC.

The `HindIII` enzyme preparation is contaminated with a non-specific nuclease that randomly cleaved the plasmid into two fragments.\n\nE.

For a circular DNA digested by a restriction enzyme:\n- If there is exactly one recognition site ($k=1$), a complete digest produces one linear fragment of length $L$, hence one band at $L$ on a gel.\n- If there are $k$ recognition sites on a circular plasmid and the digest is complete, it produces $k$ fragments with lengths $\\{l_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{k}$ satisfying $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} l_{i}=L$.

Compute the sum:\n$$\nl_{1}+l_{2}=4.5\\,\\text{kb}+3.0\\,\\text{kb}=7.5\\,\\text{kb}=L.\n$$\nThis is exactly the conservation expected for a complete digest of a circular molecule with $k=2$ sites.

If digestion failed entirely, the plasmid would remain circular, typically showing supercoiled and nicked open-circle forms whose mobilities are anomalous relative to linear DNA and do not satisfy $l_{1}+l_{2}=L$. Moreover, with a failed digest one would not obtain two linear fragments with sizes summing exactly to $L$. Thus A is inconsistent with the observed two sharp linear-sized bands summing to $L$.\n\nB. Contamination with a second plasmid of $4.5\\,\\text{kb}$ having a HindIII site would yield a $4.5\\,\\text{kb}$ band from that plasmid plus a $7.5\\,\\text{kb}$ band from the linearized $p\\text{MOD1}$. The observed $3.0\\,\\text{kb}$ band would remain unexplained, and the expected $7.5\\,\\text{kb}$ band is absent. Thus B is inconsistent.\n\nC. If the map is incorrect and $p\\text{MOD1}$ actually contains two HindIII sites, a complete digest would yield exactly two fragments whose sizes sum to $L$. The observed $4.5\\,\\text{kb}$ and $3.0\\,\\text{kb}$ bands satisfy $4.5+3.0=7.5$, matching this scenario. Thus C is consistent.\n\nD. Contamination with a non-specific nuclease would cause random cleavage producing a smear or multiple heterogeneous bands, not two reproducible sharp fragments summing exactly to $L$. Thus D is inconsistent.\n\nE. If some plasmids formed a $15.0\\,\\text{kb}$ dimer and there is one HindIII site per monomer, the dimer contains two sites separated by one monomer length. A complete digest would cut at both sites to yield two fragments each of $7.5\\,\\text{kb}$, not $4.5\\,\\text{kb}$ and $3.0\\,\\text{kb}$.
