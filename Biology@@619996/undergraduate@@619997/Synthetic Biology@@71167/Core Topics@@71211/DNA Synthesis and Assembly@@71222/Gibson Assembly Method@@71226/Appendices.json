The goal is to insert a gene, amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), into a linearized plasmid vector. The ends of the linear vector and the PCR-amplified insert have been designed to have 25-base-pair regions of homology with each other. The student sets up the reaction with the vector, the insert, and a Gibson Assembly master mix. However, due to a manufacturing error, the master mix completely lacks DNA ligase, but contains all other necessary components in their correct concentrations: a 5' exonuclease, a DNA polymerase, and the appropriate reaction buffer with dNTPs. Assuming the reaction is allowed to proceed to completion under standard conditions, what is the primary molecular product that will be formed in the reaction tube?\n\nA. A covalently closed, supercoiled circular plasmid containing the insert.\n\nB. A nicked, circular, double-stranded plasmid held together by hydrogen bonds at the assembly junctions.\n\nC.

Primarily single-stranded DNA fragments corresponding to the original vector and insert pieces.", "solution": "Gibson Assembly relies on three coordinated enzymatic activities acting on fragments that share homologous ends:\n1) A 5' exonuclease resects the 5' ends of both the linear vector and the PCR insert to generate complementary single-stranded 3' overhangs across the designed 25-base-pair homology regions.\n2) These complementary single-stranded regions anneal by base pairing, producing a circular arrangement when the insert bridges the two ends of the vector. At this stage, the backbones across the junctions are discontinuous (there are gaps and potential nicks).\n3) A DNA polymerase extends from the available 3' hydroxyl ends, filling in any single-stranded gaps created by the exonuclease and annealing steps. When polymerase encounters the upstream strand, it cannot seal the pre-existing nick; only a DNA ligase can form the missing phosphodiester bonds to make the backbone continuous.\n\nIn the given reaction, DNA ligase is entirely absent. Therefore, although the exonuclease-mediated annealing and polymerase-mediated gap filling proceed to completion, the strand discontinuities at each assembly junction remain as nicks. The resulting predominant product is a circular, double-stranded plasmid in which the insert is correctly positioned and the sequence is base-paired across the junctions, but the phosphodiester backbone remains unsealed at those junctions. Such a molecule is referred to as a nicked circular plasmid held together by hydrogen bonding (base pairing) across the assembly junctions.\n\nThis rules out:\n- A: Covalently closed (and supercoiled) circular DNA requires ligase; supercoiling is not produced by this in vitro mix and, in any case, covalent closure is absent here.\n- C: Assembly does occur because exonuclease, annealing, and polymerase are present.\n- D: Concatemerization is disfavored with specific 25-base-pair homology design intended for a single insert; without ligase, even if multimeric annealing occurred, covalent joining would not happen.\n- E: The polymerase fills in gaps, so the predominant species is double-stranded rather than single-stranded.\n\nThus, the primary product is a nicked, circular, double-stranded plasmid held together by hydrogen bonds at the assembly junctions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2040899"}, {"introduction": "An essential skill in experimental science is the ability to diagnose and troubleshoot unexpected results. In cloning, a frequent and frustrating problem is obtaining a high background of colonies containing only the original plasmid without the desired insert. This case study [@problem_id:2040868] presents this exact scenario, challenging you to apply your knowledge of the entire workflow to deduce the most probable error in the experimental setup.", "problem": "A student in an introductory synthetic biology course is tasked with constructing a new plasmid using Gibson assembly. The goal is to insert a 1.0 kilobase (kb) gene, named `geneX`, into a 4.0 kb plasmid vector called `pMOD_Kan`, which carries a kanamycin resistance gene.\n\nThe experimental plan is as follows:\n1.  The circular `pMOD_Kan` plasmid is linearized by digesting it with a single restriction enzyme, `HindIII`.\n2.  The `geneX` fragment is amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The primers for this reaction are designed to add 25 base pair (bp) overhangs to each end of the gene. These overhangs are homologous to the DNA sequences immediately flanking the `HindIII` cut site in the `pMOD_Kan` vector.\n3.  The linearized vector and the PCR-amplified insert are purified and then combined in a Gibson Assembly master mix, which contains a 5' exonuclease, a DNA polymerase, and a DNA ligase.\n4.  The assembly reaction product is used to transform a strain of chemically competent *E. coli*.\n5.  The transformed cells are plated on nutrient agar containing kanamycin to select for cells that have successfully taken up a plasmid.\n\nThe following day, the student is surprised to find several hundred colonies growing on the selection plate. To verify the assembly, they choose 12 of these colonies at random for analysis. After isolating the plasmids from these 12 cultures, a diagnostic restriction digest reveals that every single one contains the original, 4.0 kb `pMOD_Kan` vector, with no `geneX` insert.\n\nAssuming that the Gibson Assembly master mix and the PCR-generated `geneX` insert were prepared flawlessly, which of the following procedural errors in the **vector preparation stage** is the most probable cause for observing hundreds of colonies all containing the empty `pMOD_Kan` vector?\n\nA. The `HindIII` restriction digest of the `pMOD_Kan` plasmid was incomplete, leaving a significant amount of the original, uncut supercoiled plasmid in the sample used for the assembly reaction.\n\nB. The student performed the `HindIII` digest in a buffer that caused non-specific cleavage (\"star activity\"), resulting in the plasmid being fragmented at multiple random locations.\n\nC. After linearizing the plasmid with `HindIII`, the student treated the vector with an alkaline phosphatase enzyme to remove the 5' phosphate groups from the ends of the DNA.\n\nD. The student accidentally purified the wrong DNA band from an agarose gel, isolating a small, non-functional plasmid fragment instead of the 4.0 kb linearized vector.\n\nE. The student used two different restriction enzymes, `HindIII` and `EcoRI`, to digest the plasmid, which generated incompatible ends on the linearized vector.", "solution": "We analyze the outcome based on the central observation: hundreds of kanamycin-resistant colonies were obtained, and diagnostic digests from 12 randomly chosen colonies all showed the original 4.0 kb vector with no insert. This indicates that the majority of recovered plasmids were intact, replication-competent, empty pMOD_Kan molecules.\n\nIn a transformation, intact supercoiled plasmid DNA transforms at high efficiency and confers antibiotic resistance directly, independent of any assembly. Therefore, any condition that leaves a substantial fraction of intact, undigested, supercoiled pMOD_Kan in the DNA used for assembly will yield many kanamycin-resistant colonies that contain the original empty vector.\n\nEvaluate each proposed vector preparation error against the observations:\n\n- Option A (incomplete HindIII digest): If the digest is incomplete, a significant amount of the original supercoiled pMOD_Kan remains. This supercoiled plasmid transforms efficiently and yields many kanamycin-resistant colonies. Since these plasmids are the original vector, diagnostic digests would show the 4.0 kb empty vector in every miniprep tested. This exactly matches the observation of hundreds of colonies and 12 out of 12 empty-vector plasmids.\n\n- Option B (star activity causing fragmentation): Extensive star activity would fragment the plasmid at off-target sites, generating linear fragments that are not replication-competent. This would be expected to reduce colony numbers dramatically. It would not plausibly produce hundreds of colonies all carrying an intact empty vector.\n\n- Option C (vector dephosphorylation): Removing 5' phosphates from the linearized vector is intended to suppress vector self-ligation and thereby reduce empty-vector background. This treatment would not increase empty-vector colonies; it would have the opposite effect in the context of ligation-based cloning, and in Gibson assembly, lack of vector 5' phosphates would not facilitate recovery of empty vector as supercoiled, intact plasmid. Thus this does not match the observed high number of empty-vector colonies.\n\n- Option D (purifying the wrong band): Isolating a small, non-functional fragment instead of the 4.0 kb linearized vector would deprive the assembly of the correct vector backbone, leading to few or no transformants, unless there was carryover of undigested supercoiled vector. The observation of hundreds of colonies uniformly empty is better explained by abundant undigested plasmid than by isolating a wrong band. As stated, D alone does not predict a high yield of empty-vector colonies.\n\n- Option E (two enzymes yielding incompatible ends): Generating incompatible ends would prevent vector self-circularization and assembly with the insert, thereby lowering colony numbers, not increasing empty-vector recovery. It does not explain the abundance of empty-vector colonies.\n\nThe only option that directly and parsimoniously explains a large number of colonies, all containing the original empty plasmid, is Option A: an incomplete restriction digest leaving supercoiled pMOD_Kan that transforms efficiently and dominates the population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2040868"}]}
