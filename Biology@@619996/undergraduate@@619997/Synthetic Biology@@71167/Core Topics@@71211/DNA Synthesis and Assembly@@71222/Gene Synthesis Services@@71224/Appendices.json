To order this gene from a synthesis service, the researcher must provide the corresponding DNA sequence in the correct format. The DNA sequence must include a start codon and a stop codon to ensure proper expression in a bacterial system.\n\nUsing the provided standard codon table, determine the correct DNA sequence, formatted for submission. The submission format is the FASTA format, which consists of a single-line description, called the header, followed by lines of sequence data. The header line is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than (\">\") symbol in the first position. For this task, use the `TAA` codon for termination.\n\n**Codon Table:**\n- Methionine (Met): `ATG`\n- Tryptophan (Trp): `TGG`\n- Cysteine (Cys): `TGC`\n- Stop Codons: `TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`\n\nWhich of the following represents the correct DNA sequence in FASTA format for the peptide `Met-Trp-Cys`?\n\nA.\n```\n>Peptide-Alpha\nATGTTGTGCTAA\n```\n\nB.\n```\n>Peptide-Alpha\nATGTGGTGC\n```\n\nC.\n```\n>Peptide-Alpha\nTGGTGCTAA\n```\n\nD.\n```\nATGTGGTGCTAA\n```\n\nE.\n```\n>Peptide-Alpha\nATGTGGTGCTAA\n```", "solution": "We are given the peptide sequence Methionine-Tryptophan-Cysteine and a codon table specifying:\n- Methionine (Met) uses the start codon ATG.\n- Tryptophan (Trp) uses TGG.\n- Cysteine (Cys) uses TGC.\n- The required stop codon is TAA.\n\nTo construct the correct DNA sequence for expression:\n1.

Companies offer varied and competitive pricing structures, and making the right choice can significantly impact your research budget and experimental design. This problem [@problem_id:2039593] places you in the role of a researcher with a fixed budget, requiring you to perform a cost analysis to determine which vendor allows for the most ambitious design, maximizing your construct's length without exceeding financial limits.", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is designing a genetic construct for expressing a novel protein in bacteria. The budget for the synthesis of the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is capped at \\$1000. The construct must contain several essential components with fixed lengths, and one component of variable length. The components are:\n*   A promoter sequence of length $L_P = 55$ base pairs (bp).\n*   A Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) of length $L_{RBS} = 20$ bp.\n*   The Coding Sequence (CDS) for the novel protein, which consists of $N_{aa} = 300$ amino acids. Each amino acid is encoded by 3 base pairs.\n*   A C-terminal 6x-His tag for purification, which consists of 6 amino acids.\n*   A flexible peptide linker of unknown integer length $L_{linker}$ (in bp) that connects the protein to the His-tag. The researcher wants to make this linker as long as possible.\n*   A transcriptional terminator sequence of length $L_T = 75$ bp.\n\nThe researcher has received quotes from two gene synthesis companies:\n\n*   **Company A (SynthFast):** Charges a one-time setup fee of $F_A = \\$80$ and a synthesis cost of $C_A = \\$0.75$ per base pair.\n*   **Company B (GenoMax):** Charges no setup fee, but has a standard synthesis cost of $C_B = \\$0.85$ per base pair. GenoMax offers a promotion: for orders where the total length exceeds $L_{promo} = 1200$ bp, the cost for any base pairs above this threshold is discounted by 25%.\n\nAssuming the total synthesized DNA fragment is a single linear piece containing all the listed components, what is the maximum possible integer length of the flexible linker, $L_{linker}$, that the researcher can afford? Your answer should be in units of base pairs.", "solution": "Let $L_{linker}$ be an integer in base pairs. Compute the fixed lengths:\n- Coding sequence length: $L_{CDS} = 3N_{aa} = 3 \\times 300 = 900$.\n- His tag length: $L_{His} = 3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n- Fixed total without linker:\n$$\nL_{fixed} = L_{P} + L_{RBS} + L_{CDS} + L_{His} + L_{T} = 55 + 20 + 900 + 18 + 75 = 1068.\n$$\nTotal synthesized length:\n$$\nL = L_{fixed} + L_{linker} = 1068 + L_{linker}.\n$$\n\nCompany A (SynthFast) cost:\n$$\n\\text{Cost}_{A} = F_{A} + C_{A} L = 80 + 0.75(1068 + L_{linker}) = 881 + 0.75 L_{linker}.\n$$\nBudget constraint $881 + 0.75 L_{linker} \\leq 1000$ gives\n$$\n0.75 L_{linker} \\leq 119 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; L_{linker} \\leq \\frac{119}{0.75} = \\frac{476}{3} = 158.\\overline{6}.\n$$\nThus the maximum integer under Company A is $L_{linker} = 158$.\n\nCompany B (GenoMax) cost is piecewise. Let $L_{promo} = 1200$.\n\n1) If $L \\leq 1200$ (i.e., $L_{linker} \\leq 132$), cost is\n$$\n\\text{Cost}_{B} = 0.85 L = 0.85(1068 + L_{linker}) = 907.8 + 0.85 L_{linker}.\n$$\nBudget $907.8 + 0.85 L_{linker} \\leq 1000$ gives\n$$\n0.85 L_{linker} \\leq 92.2 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; L_{linker} \\leq \\frac{92.2}{0.85} \\approx 108.470\\ldots,\n$$\nso the maximum integer in this regime is $L_{linker} = 108$.\n\n2) If $L > 1200$ (i.e., $L_{linker} \\geq 133$), the first $1200$ bp cost $0.85 \\times 1200 = 1020$, and bp above $1200$ cost $0.85 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{51}{80}$.

Therefore this regime is infeasible under the budget.\n\nHence, Company B allows at most $L_{linker} = 108$, while Company A allows $L_{linker} = 158$.

This designed sequence, known as the \"reference sequence,\" is intended to encode a specific enzyme. The researcher orders the synthesis of this gene from a commercial vendor.

The explicit goal is to confirm that the synthesized DNA matches the design exactly. The most direct way to test identity at the nucleotide level is to perform a pairwise sequence alignment between the query and the reference. Pairwise alignment computes an optimal base-by-base correspondence, revealing mismatches, insertions, and deletions, which directly addresses whether the synthesized product contains any errors relative to the design. This operation is standard for quality control validation of synthesized DNA and is both necessary and sufficient for the stated goal.\n\nEvaluating the alternatives:\n- Using BLAST against a large database checks for similarity to known sequences, not exact agreement with the specific design; it will not directly verify identity to the reference and may obscure small discrepancies relative to the intended sequence.\n- Translating and predicting protein structure is indirect and unnecessary for nucleotide-level validation; synonymous mutations would be missed at the level of intended DNA sequence fidelity, and structure prediction does not serve QC of DNA synthesis.\n- Constructing a phylogenetic tree is unrelated to validating synthesis accuracy and does not test for exact sequence match.\n- Performing de novo assembly is not indicated when a single high-quality Sanger consensus is already provided; even when multiple reads exist, reference-guided alignment to the known design is more direct for validation than assembly.\n\nTherefore, the essential first step is to align the query sequence to the reference sequence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2039579"}]}
