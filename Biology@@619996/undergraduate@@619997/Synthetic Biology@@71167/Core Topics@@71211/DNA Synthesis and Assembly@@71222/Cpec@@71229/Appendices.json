This first exercise focuses on a fundamental calculation in molecular biology: determining the correct mass of insert DNA to add to a CPEC reaction. Mastering this calculation is essential, as the efficiency of assembly is highly dependent on achieving an optimal molar ratio between your vector and insert fragments [@problem_id:2028170]. You will practice converting between the length of a DNA molecule, its mass, and the number of moles to ensure your experiment is set up for success.", "problem": "A student in a synthetic biology laboratory is preparing for a Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC) experiment. The goal is to insert a gene for a novel enzyme into a plasmid vector. The circular plasmid vector has a length of 4.5 kilobase pairs (kb), and the linear double-stranded DNA insert containing the gene has a length of 750 base pairs (bp). For an efficient cloning reaction, the student needs to mix the insert and vector in a 5:1 molar ratio (insert:vector). The student will use exactly 80.0 ng of the plasmid vector in the reaction mixture. Assume that the average molecular weight per base pair is the same for both the plasmid and the insert. Given that 1 kb = 1000 bp, calculate the mass of the insert DNA required for this experiment.\n\nExpress your final answer in nanograms (ng), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $L_{v}$ and $L_{i}$ denote the lengths (in base pairs) of the vector and insert, respectively.

This problem presents a common troubleshooting scenario where incomplete linearization of the vector leads to a high background of unwanted colonies. It will challenge you to think critically about the underlying principles of bacterial transformation and plasmid DNA topology [@problem_id:2028140]. Understanding why supercoiled plasmids transform with much higher efficiency than linear or newly assembled constructs is crucial for interpreting experimental results and improving your cloning strategy.", "problem": "A student in an introductory synthetic biology course is tasked with cloning a gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) into a plasmid vector using a technique called Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC).\n\nThe plasmid vector, pVEC, is a 4.0 kilobase pair (kbp) circular piece of DNA that carries a gene for ampicillin resistance (`ampR`). The cloning strategy requires pVEC to be linearized by digestion with a single, specific restriction enzyme. The insert is a 0.7 kbp linear DNA fragment containing the GFP gene, which has been generated via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to have short sequences at its ends that are homologous to the DNA sequences flanking the linearization site in pVEC.\n\nThe student performs the restriction digest to linearize pVEC. However, due to a partially inactive enzyme stock, the digestion is incomplete. Analysis reveals that only 20% of the pVEC molecules are correctly linearized, while the remaining 80% persist as uncut, circular, supercoiled plasmids. Unaware of this issue, the student proceeds with the CPEC protocol. They mix the faulty vector preparation with the GFP insert and a high-fidelity DNA polymerase. This mixture is then used to transform a competent strain of *E. coli*. The transformed cells are plated onto nutrient agar plates containing ampicillin to select for cells that have successfully taken up a plasmid.\n\nAfter incubation, the student observes a very high number of colonies on the ampicillin plates. To check the cloning success, the student analyzes ten randomly selected colonies. They find that only two colonies are fluorescent (indicating the presence of the GFP gene), while the other eight are not. Further analysis confirms the eight non-fluorescent colonies contain only the original, unaltered pVEC plasmid.\n\nBased on the principles of bacterial transformation and the mechanism of CPEC, which of the following statements provides the most likely explanation for this high background of non-recombinant colonies?\n\nA. The linear pVEC backbone molecules efficiently re-circularized without an insert during the CPEC polymerase step and were then taken up by the cells.\n\nB. The GFP insert fragments self-circularized and were efficiently replicated by the host *E. coli* cells, but the GFP gene failed to express.\n\nC. The uncut, supercoiled pVEC molecules present in the faulty digest transformed *E. coli* at a much higher efficiency than the desired, larger CPEC-assembled products.\n\nD. A significant portion of the *E. coli* cells spontaneously developed immunity to ampicillin, allowing them to form colonies without having taken up any plasmid.\n\nE. The DNA polymerase used in the CPEC reaction degraded the linear GFP insert, leading to a low concentration of available insert and thus favoring the propagation of the original vector.", "solution": "We start from the experimental facts and principles:\n- Selection principle: Only cells harboring a plasmid carrying the ampicillin resistance gene (`ampR`) can form colonies on ampicillin plates.\n- DNA form and transformation efficiency: Supercoiled circular plasmids transform competent bacteria with much higher efficiency than nicked circular or linear DNA, i.e., if $p_{s}$ is the per-molecule transformation probability for supercoiled plasmid and $p_{r}$ is that for CPEC-assembled recombinant plasmid, then typically $p_{s} \\gg p_{r}$.\n- Mechanism of CPEC: CPEC relies on short homologous overlaps between the ends of the vector and insert; polymerase extends across these overlaps to create a covalently closed circular recombinant plasmid. A linearized vector without appropriate overlaps at its own ends cannot re-circularize without the insert-provided homology.\n\nDefine the composition of the DNA mixture after the faulty digest:\n- Fraction of uncut, supercoiled pVEC: $0.8$.\n- Fraction of linearized pVEC: $0.2$.\n- The GFP insert contains homology to the linearized pVEC ends, enabling CPEC assembly only with the linearized fraction.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of pVEC molecules in the mix. Then:\n- Number of uncut, supercoiled pVEC molecules is $0.8N$.\n- Number of linearized pVEC molecules is $0.2N$.\nLet $a$ denote the effective assembly yield (fraction of linearized vector molecules that become correctly assembled into circular recombinant plasmids suitable for transformation). Then the number of assembled recombinant molecules is $a \\cdot 0.2N$.\n\nLet $p_{s}$ be the per-molecule transformation probability for supercoiled parental pVEC and $p_{r}$ for the CPEC-assembled recombinant plasmid. The expected colony counts are proportional to:\n- Parental uncut pVEC colonies: $0.8N \\, p_{s}$.\n- Recombinant GFP colonies: $a \\cdot 0.2N \\, p_{r}$.\n\nThus, the expected fraction $f$ of fluorescent colonies is\n$$\nf=\\frac{a \\cdot 0.2N \\, p_{r}}{0.8N \\, p_{s} + a \\cdot 0.2N \\, p_{r}}=\\frac{a \\, p_{r}}{4 \\, p_{s} + a \\, p_{r}}.\n$$\nBecause supercoiled DNA transforms much more efficiently than nicked/assembled plasmids, we have $p_{s} \\gg p_{r}$, which drives $f$ to a small value. The observation of many colonies with a minority being fluorescent is therefore expected when a large fraction of uncut, supercoiled vector is present.\n\nNow evaluate the choices:\n- A: Incorrect. Linearized pVEC cannot efficiently re-circularize without the insert in CPEC, because the vector ends lack mutual homology. Moreover, nicked/linear products transform poorly compared to supercoiled DNA.\n- B: Incorrect. The GFP insert lacks both an origin of replication and `ampR`; even if it self-circularized, it would neither be selected nor maintained in *E. coli*.\n- C: Correct. The uncut, supercoiled pVEC transforms at much higher efficiency than the CPEC-assembled products, yielding a high background of non-recombinant, ampicillin-resistant colonies.\n- D: Incorrect. Spontaneous ampicillin resistance is exceedingly rare and cannot account for the high number of colonies, especially when those colonies contain the parental plasmid.\n- E: Incorrect. High-fidelity polymerases possess 3'â€“5' exonuclease proofreading but do not indiscriminately degrade the insert. Even if some insert were lost, the dominant explanation for the high background remains the highly efficient transformation of uncut supercoiled pVEC.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is that the uncut, supercoiled pVEC in the faulty digest transformed with much higher efficiency than the desired CPEC products, producing a high background of non-recombinant colonies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2028140"}, {"introduction": "Once you have potential clones growing on a plate, the next step is to verify that you have the correct construct. This practice involves designing a colony PCR screening strategy to analyze the products of your CPEC reaction.

The 3' end of `VF1`, from which DNA synthesis initiates, is located at position 200 on the plasmid map.\n- The reverse primer, `IR1`, binds within the insert. The 3' end of `IR1` is located 400 bp downstream from the 5' end of the insert's coding strand.\n\nSince CPEC allows the insert to be integrated in two possible orientations (forward or reverse), the colony PCR screening is expected to yield products of two different sizes.

We will analyze each orientation separately.\n\nThe primers used for the PCR are `VF1` (forward, on the vector) and `IR1` (reverse, on the insert). The PCR product will be the DNA segment spanning the region between the 3' ends of these two primers.\n\n**Given parameters:**\n- Vector size, $L_{vec} = 3000$ bp\n- Insert size, $L_{ins} = 1200$ bp\n- Vector linearization/insertion site position, $C = 500$ bp\n- Vector forward primer `VF1` position, $P_{V} = 200$ bp\n- Distance of insert reverse primer `IR1` from the 5' end of the insert, $d_{i} = 400$ bp\n\nFirst, let's calculate the length of the vector backbone segment between the forward primer `VF1` and the insertion site. Since amplification proceeds along the shortest path, we consider the distance along the plasmid map.\nThe distance from the `VF1` primer site to the insertion site is:\n$d_{vec} = C - P_{V} = 500 \\text{ bp} - 200 \\text{ bp} = 300 \\text{ bp}$.\n\nNow, we consider the two possible orientations for the insert.\n\n**Case 1: Forward Orientation**\nIn the forward orientation, the 5' end of the insert's coding strand is joined at the insertion site (position 500). The reverse primer `IR1` binds at a distance $d_{i}$ from this 5' end. Therefore, the length of the segment within the insert that will be amplified is simply $d_{i}$.\nThe total length of the PCR product is the sum of the segment on the vector and the segment on the insert.\n$L_{fwd} = d_{vec} + d_{i}$\n$L_{fwd} = 300 \\text{ bp} + 400 \\text{ bp} = 700 \\text{ bp}$.\n\n**Case 2: Reverse Orientation**\nIn the reverse orientation, the insert is flipped. The 3' end of the insert's coding strand is now at the insertion site (position 500). The `IR1` primer still binds 400 bp from the insert's original 5' end. Because the insert is flipped, the distance from the insertion site to the `IR1` binding site is now measured from the 3' end of the insert.\nThe distance from the insertion site (the 3' end of the flipped insert) to the `IR1` binding site is:\n$d'_{i} = L_{ins} - d_{i}$\n$d'_{i} = 1200 \\text{ bp} - 400 \\text{ bp} = 800 \\text{ bp}$.\nThe total length of the PCR product in this orientation is the sum of the segment on the vector and this new segment length on the insert.\n$L_{rev} = d_{vec} + d'_{i}$\n$L_{rev} = 300 \\text{ bp} + 800 \\text{ bp} = 1100 \\text{ bp}$.\n\nTherefore, the two expected sizes for the PCR products, corresponding to the two possible insert orientations, are 700 bp and 1100 bp.
