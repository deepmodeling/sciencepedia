The most common method used is solid-phase phosphoramidite synthesis. This process builds a DNA strand one nucleotide at a time while it is attached to a solid support.\n\nThe synthesis begins with the first nucleoside already bound to the support, with its 5'-hydroxyl group protected by a dimethoxytrityl (DMT) group. To add each subsequent nucleotide, a four-step cycle is executed:\n1.  **Deblocking:** The acid-labile DMT protecting group on the 5' end of the growing chain is removed, exposing a reactive hydroxyl group.\n2.  **Coupling:** The next phosphoramidite monomer, activated by a catalyst, is chemically joined to the newly exposed 5'-hydroxyl group.\n3.  **Capping:** Any 5'-hydroxyl groups that failed to react during the coupling step are permanently blocked by acetylation. This prevents the formation of undesired deletion-mutant sequences.\n4.  **Oxidation:** The newly formed, unstable phosphite triester linkage between the nucleotides is oxidized to a stable phosphate triester linkage.\n\nThis four-step cycle is repeated until the oligonucleotide reaches its target length. After the final nucleotide has been added and the last cycle is complete, one additional deblocking reaction is performed to remove the DMT group from the 5' end of the full-length DNA strand.\n\nCalculate the total number of individual chemical reactions (i.e., the sum of all deblocking, coupling, capping, and oxidation steps) required to synthesize a single DNA molecule that is 20 nucleotides in length (a 20-mer).", "solution": "Let the target oligonucleotide length be $L=20$.

The design of these fragments is a crucial optimization problem governed by the limitations of chemical synthesis and enzymatic assembly methods.\n\nConsider a target gene of length $L = 10,000$ base pairs (bp). You are tasked with partitioning this gene into a set of contiguous, non-overlapping fragments $\\{F_1, F_2, \\dots, F_N\\}$ that cover the entire sequence.
