This practice explores the concept of \"assembly efficiency\" by analyzing colony counts from a yeast transformation experiment. By using proper controls, we can distinguish colonies containing the desired recombinant plasmid from background noise, such as those arising from vector self-ligation, allowing us to calculate a meaningful measure of experimental success [@problem_id:2079601].", "problem": "A student in a synthetic biology lab is performing a yeast assembly experiment to construct a new plasmid. The technique relies on the yeast's native homologous recombination machinery to assemble a linearized expression vector with a gene insert. The vector contains the `URA3` gene, which allows yeast cells that have successfully formed a circular plasmid to grow on a synthetic defined medium that lacks uracil (SD-Ura).\n\nThe student sets up four parallel transformations to characterize the assembly process. An equal volume from each transformation is plated onto an individual SD-Ura plate.\n\n*   **Plate 1 (Full Assembly):** Yeast transformed with the linearized vector and the gene insert.\n*   **Plate 2 (Vector-Only Control):** Yeast transformed with only the linearized vector (no insert).\n*   **Plate 3 (Negative Control):** A mock transformation using sterile water instead of DNA.\n\nAfter incubation, the following colony counts are recorded:\n*   Colonies on Plate 1: 525\n*   Colonies on Plate 2: 35\n*   Colonies on Plate 3: 2\n\nThe \"assembly efficiency\" is a metric used to quantify the success of the recombination, defined as the proportion of colonies from the full assembly (Plate 1) that are true recombinants (i.e., formed from the vector correctly incorporating the insert). The remaining colonies are considered background, primarily arising from the linearized vector re-circularizing on its own without the insert, a process quantified by the vector-only control.\n\nAssuming the background from spontaneous mutation (indicated by Plate 3) is a baseline event that should be accounted for in all DNA-containing transformations, calculate the assembly efficiency. Express your final answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Define the recorded colony counts as $N_{1}$ for Plate 1 (full assembly), $N_{2}$ for Plate 2 (vector-only control), and $N_{3}$ for Plate 3 (negative control). The spontaneous-mutation baseline to be accounted for in DNA-containing transformations is $B=N_{3}$.\n\nFor each DNA-containing plate, subtract the baseline to obtain the DNA-dependent colony counts:\n$$T_{1}=N_{1}-B,\\quad T_{2}=N_{2}-B.$$\n\nThe background in the full-assembly plate due to vector re-circularization (without insert) is estimated by $T_{2}$. Therefore, the number of true recombinants is\n$$R=T_{1}-T_{2}=(N_{1}-B)-(N_{2}-B)=N_{1}-N_{2}.$$\n\nThe assembly efficiency is defined as the proportion of Plate 1 colonies that are true recombinants:\n$$E=\\frac{R}{T_{1}}=\\frac{N_{1}-N_{2}}{N_{1}-B}.$$\n\nSubstitute the given values $N_{1}=525$, $N_{2}=35$, and $B=N_{3}=2$:\n$$E=\\frac{525-35}{525-2}=\\frac{490}{523}=1-\\frac{33}{523}.$$\n\nCompute the decimal approximation and round to three significant figures:\n$$E\\approx 0.937.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.937}$$", "id": "2079601"}, {"introduction": "After a successful transformation, it's essential to verify that the DNA fragments assembled in the intended order. Simply confirming the presence of your genes of interest isn't enough; you must confirm the specific junctions between them. This thought experiment challenges you to design a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) strategy to specifically detect the novel DNA sequence created at the junction of two assembled fragments, a fundamental skill for validating any DNA assembly project [@problem_id:2079553].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is constructing a yeast-based biosensor. The goal is to assemble two separate DNA fragments into a linearized yeast expression vector, `pYEX-L`, using in-vivo homologous recombination. The components are:\n\n1.  **Linearized Vector (`pYEX-L`):** A circular plasmid that has been cut at a single site to create a linear DNA molecule with two distinct ends. Let's call the sequence just upstream of the cut site `V_up` and the sequence just downstream `V_down`.\n\n2.  **Fragment 1 (The Sensor):** This fragment contains a promoter, `pSEN`, which is activated by a specific metabolite. The 5' end of this fragment has a short region of homology to `V_up`. The 3' end has a unique homologous \"stitching\" sequence, `H_mid`.\n\n3.  **Fragment 2 (The Reporter):** This fragment contains the coding sequence for a blue chromoprotein, `bcp`, followed by a transcription terminator, `tTERM`. The 5' end of this fragment has the same homologous \"stitching\" sequence, `H_mid`. The 3' end has a short region of homology to `V_down`.\n\nWhen these three DNA molecules (`pYEX-L`, Fragment 1, and Fragment 2) are transformed into yeast, the cell's recombination machinery is expected to assemble them into a single circular plasmid with the structure: `...-V_up-pSEN-H_mid-bcp-tTERM-V_down-...`. The `H_mid` sequence will exist as a single copy at the novel junction between the `pSEN` and `bcp` elements.\n\nTo verify that Fragment 1 was successfully joined to Fragment 2, the biologist plans to perform a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on the DNA extracted from the transformed yeast colonies. Which of the following primer pair strategies would be the most effective and specific for confirming the formation of the intended `pSEN-bcp` junction?\n\nA. A forward primer binding within the `V_up` sequence on the vector and a reverse primer binding within the `tTERM` sequence.\n\nB. A forward primer and a reverse primer that both bind to sequences within the `pYEX-L` vector backbone, far away from the insertion site.\n\nC. A forward primer binding within the unique (non-homologous) region of the `pSEN` promoter and a reverse primer binding within the unique (non-homologous) region of the `bcp` chromoprotein gene.\n\nD. A forward primer binding within the unique (non-homologous) region of the `bcp` chromoprotein gene and a reverse primer binding within the `V_down` sequence on the vector.\n\nE. A forward primer and a reverse primer that both bind to sequences within the `H_mid` homologous region.", "solution": "Goal: confirm that Fragment 1 (pSEN) is correctly joined to Fragment 2 (bcp) at the intended junction created via the shared homologous stitching sequence H_mid. PCR will produce a product only if the two primers anneal to template sites that are present, in the correct relative orientation, and within amplifiable distance on the same DNA molecule. To maximize specificity for the intended junction, primers should be placed in unique, non-homologous regions immediately flanking the junction so that amplification occurs only if pSEN is directly contiguous with bcp in the assembled plasmid.\n\nAnalysis of options:\n\nA. Forward in V_up and reverse in tTERM. This can amplify only if both fragments are inserted between V_up and V_down in the correct orientation, but it does not directly test the pSEN–bcp junction; it would not distinguish an assembly that includes both fragments but with an unintended internal rearrangement at the junction from the correct junction. It is less specific for the precise pSEN–bcp linkage.\n\nB. Both primers in the vector backbone far from the insertion. This primarily reports the presence of vector DNA and is not specific for any insertion or the pSEN–bcp junction. It could amplify empty vector or background and is therefore not informative for the intended junction.\n\nC. Forward in the unique region of pSEN and reverse in the unique region of bcp. This strategy directly targets sequences on opposite sides of the intended junction. A PCR product will form only if pSEN is directly joined to bcp in the correct orientation and contiguity, providing high specificity for the correct recombination event while avoiding amplification from empty vector or single fragments.\n\nD. Forward in bcp and reverse in V_down. This confirms the presence and correct orientation of Fragment 2 relative to the vector but does not test whether Fragment 1 (pSEN) is joined upstream of bcp. It cannot confirm the pSEN–bcp junction.\n\nE. Both primers in H_mid. H_mid is the shared homologous region present on both fragments before assembly and as a single copy after assembly; using both primers within H_mid risks nonspecific amplification (including from unassembled fragments) and provides no information about linkage to pSEN or bcp. It lacks uniqueness and junction specificity.\n\nTherefore, the most effective and specific primer pair for confirming the intended pSEN–bcp junction is one primer in pSEN and the other in bcp, i.e., option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2079553"}, {"introduction": "Experimental work often involves troubleshooting unexpected results, which requires a deep understanding of every step in a protocol. This scenario presents a common but critical error in a yeast assembly workflow: contamination of the transformation mix with the original PCR template plasmid. By working through this problem, you will learn to think like a molecular detective, considering all possible DNA species in a reaction to diagnose a common source of \"false positive\" colonies and understand the importance of DNA purification steps [@problem_id:2079558].", "problem": "A student in a synthetic biology lab aims to clone a gene called `opt_GFP` (optimized Green Fluorescent Protein), which has a length of 1.2 kilobase pairs (kbp), into a yeast expression vector named `pYEX-DEST` (4.8 kbp). The `pYEX-DEST` vector carries a blasticidin resistance gene (`BsdR`) for selection.\n\nThe cloning strategy is based on in-vivo homologous recombination in yeast. To prepare the necessary DNA fragments, the student performs two steps:\n1.  The circular `pYEX-DEST` vector is linearized by a restriction enzyme that cuts it once at the target insertion site.\n2.  The `opt_GFP` gene is amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The primers are designed to add 40-base-pair homology arms to each end of the gene, which match the sequences flanking the cut site in the linearized `pYEX-DEST`.\n\nThe student makes a critical error in selecting the DNA template for the PCR. The template used is an older plasmid, `pYEX-LEGACY`, which already contains the `opt_GFP` gene. Crucially, `pYEX-LEGACY` was built using the exact same 4.8 kbp backbone as `pYEX-DEST` and therefore also contains the `BsdR` gene.\n\nAfter the PCR is complete, the student takes the entire raw PCR reaction mixture, without any purification or enzymatic treatment to remove the template DNA. This mixture is combined with the linearized `pYEX-DEST` vector and used to transform yeast cells. The transformed cells are then grown on agar plates containing blasticidin.\n\nMany of the resulting colonies are found to contain an unintended plasmid instead of the desired new construct. What is the total size of this unintended circular plasmid, in kbp? Answer with a single real number.", "solution": "The problem asks for the size of an unintended plasmid product resulting from a yeast cloning experiment. We must analyze the components of the transformation mixture and how they behave inside the yeast cell under selection pressure.\n\nFirst, let's identify all the major DNA species present in the mixture used to transform the yeast cells.\n1.  **Linearized `pYEX-DEST` vector**: This is the 4.8 kbp backbone, prepared correctly for recombination.\n2.  **`opt_GFP` amplicon**: This is the intended 1.2 kbp gene fragment, amplified by PCR and equipped with the necessary homology arms for assembly.\n3.  **`pYEX-LEGACY` template plasmid**: The problem states the student uses the raw, unpurified PCR reaction. This means the original template DNA, the circular `pYEX-LEGACY` plasmid, is still present in the mixture.\n\nSecond, let's determine the properties of the `pYEX-LEGACY` plasmid. It is described as having the same 4.8 kbp backbone as `pYEX-DEST` and containing the 1.2 kbp `opt_GFP` gene.\nThe total size of the circular `pYEX-LEGACY` plasmid is the sum of the backbone size and the gene size:\n$$ \\text{Size of } pYEX-LEGACY = \\text{Backbone size} + \\text{Gene size} = 4.8 \\text{ kbp} + 1.2 \\text{ kbp} = 6.0 \\text{ kbp} $$\nCrucially, since it shares the same backbone as `pYEX-DEST`, `pYEX-LEGACY` also carries the blasticidin resistance gene, `BsdR`.\n\nThird, let's consider the possible events inside the yeast cells after transformation and plating on blasticidin media.\n*   **Intended Event (Homologous Recombination):** The yeast cell's DNA repair machinery recognizes the homologous arms on the linear `opt_GFP` amplicon and the ends of the linear `pYEX-DEST` vector. It will stitch these two pieces together to form a new, circular recombinant plasmid. This is the desired product. This plasmid contains the `BsdR` gene and will allow the cell to grow on blasticidin. Its size would also be $4.8 + 1.2 = 6.0$ kbp.\n*   **Unintended Event (Template Contamination):** Yeast cells are also capable of taking up intact, circular plasmids. The `pYEX-LEGACY` template plasmid is present in the transformation mixture. If a yeast cell takes up this plasmid, it acquires a stable, circular DNA molecule that can replicate. Since `pYEX-LEGACY` contains the `BsdR` gene, this cell will be resistant to blasticidin and will form a colony on the selection plate.\n\nThe question asks for the size of the *unintended* plasmid product. This corresponds to the `pYEX-LEGACY` template plasmid that contaminates the assembly reaction. As calculated above, the size of this plasmid is 6.0 kbp. This is a common experimental artifact when the PCR template is not removed (e.g., by DpnI digestion, which selectively degrades the methylated parental plasmid) before transformation. The recovery of the original template plasmid is an unintended, yet frequent, outcome of the described procedure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.0}$$", "id": "2079558"}]}
