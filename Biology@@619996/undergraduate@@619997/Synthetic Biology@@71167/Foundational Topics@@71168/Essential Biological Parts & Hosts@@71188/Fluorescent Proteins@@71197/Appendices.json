Mastering their use is a crucial first step in programming cellular behavior.

They have successfully transformed *Escherichia coli* cells with a plasmid vector. This plasmid carries a gene encoding a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The expression of the GFP gene is under the control of the pBAD promoter, a well-characterized regulatory element derived from the arabinose operon. This promoter requires the binding of an activated AraC regulatory protein to initiate transcription.\n\nThe student prepares a nutrient agar medium, spreads the transformed *E. coli* cells on the plate, and incubates it overnight. The next day, a healthy lawn of bacterial colonies is observed on the plate. However, when the plate is placed on a blue light transilluminator, none of the colonies exhibit the expected green fluorescence. Assuming the transformation was successful and the plasmid sequence is correct, which one of the following single components was most likely omitted from the nutrient agar medium, thereby preventing the expression of GFP?\n\nA. Glucose\n\nB. Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)\n\nC. Ampicillin\n\nD. Arabinose\n\nE. Anhydrotetracycline (aTc)", "solution": "The gene is under the pBAD promoter, which is regulated by AraC. The regulatory principle is that AraC in the absence of arabinose binds DNA to form a repressive loop, preventing transcription initiation. When arabinose is present, it binds AraC, converting it to an activator that facilitates RNA polymerase binding and transcription from pBAD. Therefore, induction of pBAD strictly requires arabinose; without arabinose, GFP is not expressed and colonies will not fluoresce.\n\nEvaluating each option with respect to whether its omission would prevent pBAD-driven GFP expression:\n- Glucose participates in catabolite repression; its presence can suppress pBAD expression via reduced cAMP–CRP activity. Omitting glucose would not prevent expression; if anything, it would favor induction. Thus omission of glucose is not the cause.\n- Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induces lac-based promoters, not pBAD. Its omission has no effect on pBAD.\n- Ampicillin is used for selection of transformants but is not required for promoter induction. Its omission would not intrinsically prevent GFP expression in transformed cells.\n- Arabinose is the required inducer for pBAD via AraC activation. Its omission directly prevents GFP expression.\n- Anhydrotetracycline (aTc) induces tet-based promoters, not pBAD. Its omission is irrelevant to pBAD.\n\nTherefore, the single omitted component that would prevent GFP expression from pBAD is arabinose.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2038234"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple on/off control, fine-tuning the level of protein expression is a key goal in synthetic biology. This practice explores the powerful concept of codon optimization, revealing that not all \"silent\" mutations are truly silent in their effect on protein yield. By analyzing a simplified model based on codon usage bias, you will quantify how changing a single codon for an amino acid can dramatically alter the rate of translation, providing a crucial tool for rationally designing and optimizing genetic constructs [@problem_id:2038274].", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is working to express a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) in an *Escherichia coli* host. The team notices that the fluorescence output from their engineered bacteria is lower than expected. Upon sequencing a fragment of the messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) transcript for the RFP, they find the sequence `5'-GUA-CGC-AAA-3'`. To improve expression, a bioinformatic tool suggests a silent mutation, changing the original sequence to a new sequence `5'-GUA-CGU-AAA-3'`. Both the `CGC` and `CGU` codons encode for the amino acid Arginine, so the primary protein sequence is unchanged.\n\nThe efficiency of translation in *E. coli* is not uniform for all codons. A simplified model proposes that the local rate of protein synthesis is proportional to a \"Translational Efficiency Factor\" (TEF), which is related to the abundance of the corresponding transfer RNA. The overall translation rate for a short mRNA sequence is assumed to be proportional to the product of the TEFs for each codon in that sequence.\n\nThe TEFs for the relevant codons in *E. coli* are given in the table below:\n\n| Codon | Amino Acid | TEF   |\n|-------|------------|-------|\n| GUA   | Valine     | 0.65  |\n| CGC   | Arginine   | 0.42  |\n| CGU   | Arginine   | 0.91  |\n| AAA   | Lysine     | 0.88  |\n\nAssuming this model is accurate, calculate the ratio of the estimated translation rate of the new (mutated) mRNA fragment to the rate of the original mRNA fragment.

This exercise presents a counter-intuitive but critical observation related to the concept of metabolic burden. By comparing high-copy and low-copy plasmid systems, you will explore why simply increasing gene dosage does not always result in a greater yield of functional protein, highlighting the essential interplay between a synthetic circuit and its cellular host [@problem_id:2038282].", "problem": "A synthetic biology student is working on a project to engineer *E. coli* bacteria to produce a vibrant red color. To achieve this, she uses a plasmid to express a gene for a monomeric Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP). The expression of the RFP gene is controlled by a strong, constitutive promoter. The student constructs two different systems:\n\n- **System A:** The RFP gene is placed on a high-copy-number plasmid, which maintains approximately 300 copies per cell.\n- **System B:** The RFP gene is placed on a low-copy-number plasmid, which maintains approximately 15 copies per cell.\n\nBoth plasmids carry the same antibiotic resistance gene for selection. After transforming the plasmids into separate populations of *E. coli* and plating them on selective agar plates, she incubates them overnight. The next day, she observes that the bacterial colonies corresponding to System B (low-copy plasmid) are noticeably more intensely red than the colonies corresponding to System A (high-copy plasmid).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this counter-intuitive observation?\n\nA. The high-copy plasmid is significantly larger and puts a replicative strain on the cell, leading to a high rate of plasmid loss during cell division, resulting in fewer cells in the colony that can produce RFP.\n\nB. The promoter used to drive RFP expression is subject to strong product-inhibition, meaning that the high concentration of RFP produced in System A cells suppresses further transcription of the RFP gene.\n\nC. The massive overexpression of RFP from the high-copy plasmid imposes a severe metabolic burden on the host cells. This depletes essential cellular resources (such as amino acids and ATP) and overwhelms the protein folding machinery, leading to a high proportion of misfolded, non-functional RFP that fails to mature its chromophore.\n\nD. High intracellular concentrations of properly folded RFP are directly toxic to *E. coli*, causing significant cell death within the colony for System A and thus reducing the total visible biomass capable of fluorescing.", "solution": "We seek the most fundamental explanation for why colonies carrying a low-copy plasmid (System B) appear more intensely red than those with a high-copy plasmid (System A), despite both using the same strong constitutive promoter and the same RFP gene.\n\nFirst, formalize how visible colony color intensity depends on cellular processes. Let the total visible red signal from a colony, $I$, be proportional to the total amount of properly folded, matured RFP. Write\n$$\nI \\propto N_{\\text{cells}} \\times \\left(P_{\\text{cell}} \\times f_{\\text{fold}} \\times f_{\\text{mature}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{cells}}$ is the number of viable cells contributing biomass in the colony, $P_{\\text{cell}}$ is the gross RFP production per cell (translation output), $f_{\\text{fold}}$ is the fraction of synthesized RFP that properly folds, and $f_{\\text{mature}}$ is the fraction that successfully matures its chromophore to become fluorescent and visibly red. The factors $f_{\\text{fold}}$ and $f_{\\text{mature}}$ depend on the availability of cellular folding capacity (e.g., chaperones and proteostasis machinery), energy, and the cellular environment (e.g., oxygen for chromophore formation).\n\nRelate plasmid copy number to expression burden. Let $n_{\\text{copy}}$ denote plasmid copy number and $k_{\\text{expr}}$ denote the per-copy expression drive set by promoter and RBS strength. Then the nominal expression load per cell scales as\n$$\nP_{\\text{cell}}^{\\text{nominal}} \\propto n_{\\text{copy}} \\times k_{\\text{expr}}.\n$$\nHowever, the host has finite biosynthetic resources. Let $R$ denote the total translational capacity and folding capacity per cell, which must be partitioned among native proteins and the heterologous RFP. When $n_{\\text{copy}}$ is very large, the heterologous demand can saturate $R$, causing:\n- Lower effective translation per transcript due to competition for ribosomes and amino acids, so the realized $P_{\\text{cell}}$ does not increase linearly with $n_{\\text{copy}}$.\n- Reduced $f_{\\text{fold}}$ because chaperones and quality control systems become saturated, increasing misfolding and aggregation.\n- Reduced $f_{\\text{mature}}$ because improperly folded protein cannot undergo the autocatalytic chromophore maturation; even properly folded protein may mature more slowly if cellular energy and oxidative conditions are perturbed by burden.\n\nLet the metabolic burden impact cell growth. Define $\\mu$ as the growth rate; severe burden reduces $\\mu$, yielding smaller $N_{\\text{cells}}$ at a fixed incubation time. Thus, for very high $n_{\\text{copy}}$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{high-copy}} \\propto N_{\\text{cells}}^{\\downarrow} \\times \\left(P_{\\text{cell}}^{\\text{realized not linear}} \\times f_{\\text{fold}}^{\\downarrow} \\times f_{\\text{mature}}^{\\downarrow}\\right),\n$$\nwhile for moderate $n_{\\text{copy}}$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{low-copy}} \\propto N_{\\text{cells}}^{\\uparrow} \\times \\left(P_{\\text{cell}}^{\\text{adequate}} \\times f_{\\text{fold}}^{\\uparrow} \\times f_{\\text{mature}}^{\\uparrow}\\right).\n$$\nThe net effect can make $I_{\\text{low-copy}} > I_{\\text{high-copy}}$ even though the nominal gene dosage is lower, because functional, matured RFP per colony is higher when the host is not overwhelmed.\n\nEvaluate the options against these principles:\n- Option A posits plasmid loss from replicative strain. High-copy plasmids are generally retained well; moreover, on selective agar, plasmid-free cells are strongly disadvantaged. This is not a fundamental or typical explanation for reduced color in high-copy systems.\n- Option B invokes product inhibition at the promoter by RFP itself. RFP does not act as a transcriptional regulator of its own promoter in this construct, and fluorescent proteins are not known to directly repress constitutive promoters. This is not accurate.\n- Option C states that massive overexpression imposes metabolic and proteostasis burden, depleting resources and overwhelming folding machinery, which increases the fraction of misfolded, non-mature RFP. This directly matches the resource-allocation and folding-limitation framework above and is the standard, fundamental explanation.\n- Option D claims properly folded RFP is directly toxic at high concentrations, causing cell death. Fluorescent proteins are generally well tolerated; direct toxicity of correctly folded RFP at expression levels typical for bacterial systems is not the predominant cause of reduced colony coloration.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is the resource and folding burden described in Option C, which reduces $f_{\\text{fold}}$, $f_{\\text{mature}}$, $P_{\\text{cell}}$ realization, and $N_{\\text{cells}}$, leading to lower visible red intensity in the high-copy system compared to the low-copy system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2038282"}]}
