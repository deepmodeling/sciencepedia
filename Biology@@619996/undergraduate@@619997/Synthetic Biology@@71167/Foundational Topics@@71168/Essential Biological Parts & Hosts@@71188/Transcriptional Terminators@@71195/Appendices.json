The circuit includes a gene for a fluorescent reporter protein followed by a Rho-independent transcriptional terminator. Initial tests reveal that the terminator is \"leaky,\" meaning that a significant fraction of RNA polymerase molecules read through the terminator, leading to unwanted transcription of downstream DNA.\n\nThe structure of this leaky terminator consists of a self-complementary region that forms an RNA hairpin (stem-loop) followed immediately by a short tract of eight uracils (a poly-U tract). The student hypothesizes that increasing the thermodynamic stability of the hairpin could improve termination. They propose to use site-directed mutagenesis to modify the nucleotide sequence of the hairpin's stem region, increasing its Guanine-Cytosine (GC) content while keeping the total number of base pairs in the stem constant.\n\nAssuming the student's modification is successful, what is the most likely effect on the efficiency of transcriptional termination?\n\nA. Termination efficiency will increase.\n\nB. Termination efficiency will decrease.\n\nC. Termination efficiency will not change, as hairpin stability is irrelevant.\n\nD. The terminator will become Rho-dependent.\n\nE. Termination efficiency will decrease because a more stable hairpin will prevent the RNA from dissociating from the DNA template.", "solution": "1) Mechanistic premise: A Rho-independent (intrinsic) terminator comprises a GC-rich RNA hairpin followed by a poly-U tract. Formation of the hairpin in the nascent RNA causes RNA polymerase pausing and destabilizes the elongation complex, while the downstream rU-dA RNA-DNA hybrid is intrinsically weak, facilitating release of the transcript. Thus, termination efficiency depends on two coupled stabilities: the hairpin’s folding free energy and the RNA-DNA hybrid’s base-pairing strength, with a weak rU-dA hybrid aiding dissociation.\n\n2) Effect of GC enrichment on hairpin stability: Increasing GC content in the hairpin stem, at constant stem length, lowers the hairpin folding free energy (makes it more negative), due to stronger base-pairing and stacking of GC pairs relative to AU pairs. Symbolically, if $\\Delta G_{\\text{hairpin}}$ denotes the free energy of hairpin formation, then the proposed mutation yields $\\Delta G_{\\text{hairpin}}^{\\prime} < \\Delta G_{\\text{hairpin}}$ (more stable hairpin).\n\n3) Consequence for termination probability: Let $P_{\\text{term}}$ denote termination efficiency and $\\Delta G_{\\text{hybrid}}$ denote the free energy of the rU-dA RNA-DNA hybrid. Empirically and mechanistically, $P_{\\text{term}}$ increases as the hairpin becomes thermodynamically more stable and as the RNA-DNA hybrid becomes weaker. Thus, for fixed poly-U tract (constant $\\Delta G_{\\text{hybrid}}$), making the hairpin more stable increases $P_{\\text{term}}$. In functional terms, $\\frac{\\partial P_{\\text{term}}}{\\partial \\Delta G_{\\text{hairpin}}} < 0$, so a decrease in $\\Delta G_{\\text{hairpin}}$ increases $P_{\\text{term}}$.\n\n4) Evaluation of the proposed options:\n- Option A (increase): Consistent with strengthened hairpin causing stronger pausing and destabilization of the elongation complex, boosting termination when the poly-U hybrid remains weak.\n- Option B (decrease): Contradicted by the mechanistic relationship above.\n- Option C (no change): Incorrect; hairpin stability is a key determinant of intrinsic termination.\n- Option D (become Rho-dependent): Incorrect; sequence architecture still encodes an intrinsic terminator. Strengthening the hairpin does not invoke Rho dependence.\n- Option E (decrease because stable hairpin prevents RNA dissociation): Incorrect; the RNA must dissociate from the DNA by melting the rU-dA hybrid, not the intramolecular hairpin. A more stable hairpin promotes, rather than prevents, release by destabilizing the transcription complex while the weak rU-dA hybrid melts.\n\n5) Conclusion: Increasing GC content in the hairpin stem, keeping length and poly-U tract constant, is most likely to increase termination efficiency, reducing readthrough.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2077918"}, {"introduction": "To predictably engineer genetic circuits, we must move beyond qualitative descriptions and quantitatively characterize our genetic parts. This problem introduces a classic experimental method in synthetic biology—the dual-reporter assay—used to measure the performance of components like terminators.

To do this, they employ a dual-reporter plasmid system in *E. coli*.\n\nTwo plasmids are constructed:\n\n1.  **Control Plasmid (pControl):** This plasmid contains a strong constitutive promoter ($P_{const}$) that drives the expression of a gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) immediately followed by a gene for Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP). There is no terminator sequence between the two reporter genes.

This problem examines the consequences of a \"leaky\" or imperfect terminator placed between two genes in a bicistronic construct.

Consider a bicistronic construct designed for expression in a bacterial host. The DNA architecture is as follows:\n\nPromoter (P) — Ribosome Binding Site 1 (RBS1) — Gene A — Terminator (T) — Ribosome Binding Site 2 (RBS2) — Gene B\n\nThe circuit is designed with these properties:\n- The promoter (P) is constitutive, initiating transcription at a constant rate.\n- Gene A and Gene B code for two different proteins, Protein A and Protein B, respectively.\n- The terminator (T) is not perfectly efficient. It has a termination efficiency, $\\eta_T$, of 0.95. The termination efficiency is defined as the fraction of RNA polymerase complexes that successfully terminate transcription at this site.

The degradation rates of all messenger RNA (mRNA) species produced from this construct are identical.\n\nCalculate the expected molar ratio of the steady-state concentration of Protein A to Protein B, denoted as $\\frac{[P_A]_{ss}}{[P_B]_{ss}}$.", "solution": "Let's model the production and degradation of both proteins to determine their steady-state concentrations.\n\nLet $R$ be the constant rate at which the promoter (P) initiates transcription, measured in transcripts per unit time per cell volume.\n\nFirst, we analyze the transcription process for both genes.\nEvery transcription event initiated at P will produce a transcript containing the sequence for Gene A. Therefore, the total rate of production of mRNA sequences containing Gene A is simply $R$.\nThe terminator (T) has an efficiency $\\eta_T = 0.95$. This means that 95% of the RNA polymerases that reach T will terminate transcription. The remaining fraction, $(1 - \\eta_T)$, will \"read through\" the terminator and continue to transcribe Gene B.\nConsequently, an mRNA sequence containing Gene B is only produced during these read-through events. The rate of production of mRNA sequences containing Gene B is therefore $R \\cdot (1 - \\eta_T)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the translation process. Let $k_{tl}$ be the translation rate constant, which is a factor that encapsulates the efficiency of the RBS and the translation machinery. The problem states that the RBS efficiencies are identical, so we use the same $k_{tl}$ for both. The rate of protein synthesis is proportional to this constant and the concentration of the corresponding mRNA.\n\nLet's establish the steady-state concentrations of the relevant mRNA pools. We have short transcripts (containing only Gene A) and long transcripts (containing both Gene A and Gene B).\nThe key insight is that the rate of protein production is proportional to the total rate of production of mRNA templates for that protein.\nLet's denote the production rates of Protein A and Protein B as $S_A$ and $S_B$.\nSince every transcript initiated contains a translatable sequence for Gene A (via RBS1), the total synthesis rate of Protein A is proportional to the total transcription initiation rate, $R$.\nSo, $S_A \\propto R$.\nSince only the read-through transcripts contain a translatable sequence for Gene B (via RBS2), the synthesis rate of Protein B is proportional to the read-through transcription rate, $R(1 - \\eta_T)$.\nSo, $S_B \\propto R(1 - \\eta_T)$.\n\nLet's write this more formally. Let $[mRNA_A]$ and $[mRNA_B]$ represent the concentrations of available templates for translating Protein A and Protein B, respectively.\nThe rate of change of the protein concentrations, $[P_A]$ and $[P_B]$, can be described by the following differential equations, where $k_{deg}$ is the protein degradation rate constant (assumed to be the same for both proteins).\n$$ \\frac{d[P_A]}{dt} = (\\text{translation rate of A}) - k_{deg}[P_A] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[P_B]}{dt} = (\\text{translation rate of B}) - k_{deg}[P_B] $$\nThe translation rates are proportional to the concentration of their respective mRNA templates. From the problem statement, the RBS efficiencies are the same, so we can write the translation rates as $k_{tl} [mRNA_A]$ and $k_{tl} [mRNA_B]$.\n\nTo find the steady-state concentration of the mRNA templates, we balance their production and degradation. Let $\\gamma_{mRNA}$ be the mRNA degradation rate constant.\nAt steady state, the concentration of mRNA templates for Protein A is proportional to its production rate: $[mRNA_A]_{ss} \\propto R$. More formally, $[mRNA_A]_{ss} = \\frac{R}{\\gamma_{mRNA}}$.\nSimilarly, the concentration of mRNA templates for Protein B is proportional to its production rate: $[mRNA_B]_{ss} \\propto R(1 - \\eta_T)$. More formally, $[mRNA_B]_{ss} = \\frac{R(1 - \\eta_T)}{\\gamma_{mRNA}}$.\n\nNow we can write the protein differential equations in terms of the transcription rates.\n$$ \\frac{d[P_A]}{dt} = k_{tl} [mRNA_A]_{ss} - k_{deg}[P_A] = \\frac{k_{tl} R}{\\gamma_{mRNA}} - k_{deg}[P_A] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[P_B]}{dt} = k_{tl} [mRNA_B]_{ss} - k_{deg}[P_B] = \\frac{k_{tl} R(1 - \\eta_T)}{\\gamma_{mRNA}} - k_{deg}[P_B] $$\nAt steady state, the time derivatives are zero ($\\frac{d[P_A]}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{d[P_B]}{dt} = 0$). We can solve for the steady-state protein concentrations, $[P_A]_{ss}$ and $[P_B]_{ss}$.\n$$ [P_A]_{ss} = \\frac{k_{tl} R}{k_{deg} \\gamma_{mRNA}} $$\n$$ [P_B]_{ss} = \\frac{k_{tl} R(1 - \\eta_T)}{k_{deg} \\gamma_{mRNA}} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the desired ratio:\n$$ \\frac{[P_A]_{ss}}{[P_B]_{ss}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{tl} R}{k_{deg} \\gamma_{mRNA}}}{\\frac{k_{tl} R(1 - \\eta_T)}{k_{deg} \\gamma_{mRNA}}} $$\nThe constants $R$, $k_{tl}$, $k_{deg}$, and $\\gamma_{mRNA}$ cancel out.\n$$ \\frac{[P_A]_{ss}}{[P_B]_{ss}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\eta_T} $$\n\nThe problem provides the termination efficiency $\\eta_T = 0.95$.
