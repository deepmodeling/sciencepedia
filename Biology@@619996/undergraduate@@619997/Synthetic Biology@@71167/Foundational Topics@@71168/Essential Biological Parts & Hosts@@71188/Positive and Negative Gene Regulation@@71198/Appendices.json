The biosensor is designed to detect a specific small molecule, which acts as an inducer. The circuit employs a negatively regulated promoter controlling the expression of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). In this system, a repressor protein constantly produced by the cell binds to the promoter, silencing GFP expression. When the inducer molecule is present, it binds to the repressor, preventing it from binding to the promoter and thus allowing GFP to be produced.\n\nAfter characterization, the team finds that the steady-state concentration of GFP, denoted as $[P]$, can be accurately modeled as a function of the inducer concentration, $[I]$, by the following dose-response equation:\n$$[P] = P_{min} + (P_{max} - P_{min}) \\frac{[I]^n}{K^n + [I]^n}$$\n\nThe experimentally determined parameters for this biosensor are:\n- Minimum (leaky) GFP concentration, $P_{min} = 15$ nM.\n- Maximum (saturated) GFP concentration, $P_{max} = 350$ nM.\n- Activation coefficient, $K = 50.0$ $\\mu$M.\n- Hill coefficient, $n = 2$.\n\nCalculate the steady-state GFP concentration, $[P]$, when the cell culture is exposed to an inducer concentration of $[I] = 75.0$ $\\mu$M.

This practice moves beyond simple calculation and challenges you to think like a circuit designer, using your knowledge of positive and negative regulation to engineer a diagnostic reporter system.

The circuit has two key components on two separate plasmids:\n\n1.  **Activator Plasmid**: Contains the gene for a synthetic activator protein, `ProtA`, under the control of the arabinose-inducible promoter, $P_{ara}$. The host *E. coli* strain constitutively expresses the `AraC` protein required for this promoter to function.\n2.  **Output Plasmid**: Contains the `gfp` gene under the control of a synthetic promoter, $P_{A}$, which is designed to be strongly activated upon binding of the `ProtA` protein.\n\nThe expected behavior is that adding arabinose to the growth medium will induce the expression of `ProtA`, which will then bind to $P_{A}$ and turn on the expression of GFP, causing the cells to fluoresce green.\n\nHowever, upon induction with a high concentration of arabinose, the team observes no GFP fluorescence. A key hypothesis is that there is an issue with the expression or stability of the `ProtA` protein itself. To test this, the team decides to design a third, diagnostic plasmid. This plasmid will use Red Fluorescent Protein (`rfp`) as a reporter. The diagnostic construct should be designed such that the presence of functional `ProtA` protein in the cell causes a measurable *decrease* in RFP expression.\n\nAssume that `ProtA` binds a specific DNA operator sequence, `op_A`, and that when `op_A` is placed between a promoter and a gene, the binding of `ProtA` to `op_A` is sufficient to block transcription.\n\nWhich of the following plasmid designs would be the most effective and direct diagnostic tool to test the hypothesis that functional `ProtA` protein is being produced upon arabinose induction?\n\nA.

The stated mechanism is that ProtA binds a specific operator, $op_{A}$, and when $op_{A}$ is placed between a promoter and a gene, ProtA binding is sufficient to block transcription. Thus, the relevant physical principle is transcriptional repression by an operator-bound regulator that sterically hinders or otherwise prevents RNA polymerase from productive initiation or elongation when the operator is placed in a promoter-proximal position.\n\nLet $[ProtA]$ denote the intracellular concentration of ProtA, $K_{d}$ its equilibrium dissociation constant for $op_{A}$, and $\\theta$ the operator occupancy by ProtA. A standard equilibrium binding model gives\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[ProtA]}{K_{d} + [ProtA]}.\n$$\nIf binding blocks transcription, a simple functional form for the transcription rate of $rfp$ when $op_{A}$ is placed between promoter and gene is\n$$\nr = \\beta\\left(1 - \\theta\\right) = \\beta\\left(1 - \\frac{[ProtA]}{K_{d} + [ProtA]}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the basal transcription rate of the constitutive promoter in the absence of ProtA. Upon arabinose induction, $[ProtA]$ increases if ProtA is expressed and stable, so $\\theta$ increases and $r$ decreases monotonically. Therefore, such a construct will yield a measurable decrease in RFP when functional ProtA is present.\n\nEvaluate each option against this requirement:\n\nA. $rfp$ under $P_{const}$ with $op_{A}$ between promoter and gene implements exactly the repression model above. In the absence of ProtA, $r \\approx \\beta$ (high RFP). In the presence of ProtA (upon arabinose induction if ProtA is functional), $[ProtA]$ increases, $\\theta$ increases, and $r$ decreases toward $0$, giving a measurable decrease in RFP specifically reporting functional ProtA. This directly tests the hypothesis.\n\nB. $rfp$ under $P_{ara}$ reports arabinose induction itself, not ProtA function. Its transcription rate is $r = f([ara])$ due to AraC and arabinose, independent of $[ProtA]$, so it cannot diagnose whether ProtA is expressed or functional.\n\nC. $rfp$ under $P_{A}$ increases with ProtA, i.e., $r = g([ProtA])$ is an increasing function, yielding an increase, not a decrease, in RFP upon ProtA production. This contradicts the specified requirement of a measurable decrease in RFP expression.\n\nD. $rfp$ under a $P_{const}$ repressed by AraC-arabinose reports the presence of arabinose/AraC regulation, not ProtA. The decrease in RFP would be due to AraC-arabinose, confounding the diagnostic and not directly testing ProtA function.\n\nE. $rfp$ under a bare $P_{const}$ without operator sites yields $r = \\beta$, independent of $[ProtA]$, providing no diagnostic signal.\n\nTherefore, the most effective and direct diagnostic tool that produces a measurable decrease in RFP specifically in the presence of functional ProtA is the construct in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2055784"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple ON/OFF switches, synthetic biologists aim to create circuits that perform more complex computations and signal processing.

One common objective is to create a \"band-pass filter,\" where a target gene is expressed only when the concentration of a specific input molecule falls within an intermediate range—neither too low nor too high.\n\nConsider a synthetic circuit designed in a bacterium to control the expression of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene. The expression of GFP is controlled by a promoter, denoted `P_GFP`. You are tasked with selecting a circuit design that will result in GFP production only at an intermediate, non-zero concentration of a small, cell-permeable inducer molecule, `S`.\n\nAssume the following conditions hold for all proposed circuits:\n1.  All regulatory proteins (i.e., activators and repressors) are constitutively expressed at a constant level from their own independent promoters.\n2.  The promoter `P_GFP` is inherently \"OFF\" and requires binding by an active activator protein to initiate transcription.\n3.  If both an active activator and an active repressor can bind to `P_GFP`, the repressive action is dominant and transcription is blocked.\n\nWhich of the following circuit architectures would function as a band-pass filter for the expression of GFP in response to the concentration of inducer `S`?\n\nA. The inducer `S` binds to an activator protein `A`. The resulting `S-A` complex is the only form of `A` that can bind to `P_GFP` and initiate transcription.\n\nB. The promoter `P_GFP` is activated by a constitutively active activator protein `A`. A repressor protein `R` also binds to `P_GFP` to block transcription. The inducer `S` binds exclusively to the repressor `R`, causing it to unbind from `P_GFP`.\n\nC. An activator protein `A` naturally binds to `P_GFP` and initiates transcription. The inducer `S` binds to `A`, and this `S-A` complex is unable to bind to the promoter `P_GFP`.\n\nD. The inducer `S` can bind to two distinct proteins: an activator `A` and a repressor `R`. The complex `S-A` is required to bind to `P_GFP` and activate transcription. The complex `S-R` is required to bind to `P_GFP` and repress transcription. The binding affinity of `S` for `A` is significantly higher than its affinity for `R`.\n\nE. The inducer `S` activates the expression of a repressor protein `R`. This repressor `R` then binds to `P_GFP` and blocks transcription. In the absence of `R`, the promoter `P_GFP` is activated by a constitutively active activator `A`.", "solution": "Goal: choose a circuit in which GFP expression is OFF at low $[S]$, ON at intermediate $[S]$, and OFF at high $[S]$, subject to the rules that $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$ requires an active activator for transcription and repression dominates activation when both can act on $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$.\n\nIntroduce the following general formalism. Let $Y([S])$ denote the qualitative output state of $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$ (ON or OFF). The promoter is ON if and only if an active activator form that can bind $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$ is present at $[S]$ and no active repressor form competent to bind $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$ is acting; otherwise it is OFF. By assumption 3, if both active activation and repression are possible at the promoter, then $Y([S])=\\text{OFF}$.\n\nOption A: $S$ binds to $A$ and only the complex $S\\!-\\!A$ activates $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$. No repressor is present in this description. Therefore, $Y([S])$ is OFF when $[S]$ is near zero (no $S\\!-\\!A$), and monotonically turns ON as $[S]$ increases, remaining ON at high $[S]$. This cannot produce OFF at high $[S]$, so it is not band-pass.\n\nOption B: An activator $A$ that is constitutively active can activate $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$, while a repressor $R$ blocks transcription by binding $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$. $S$ binds $R$ and causes it to unbind (derepression). At low $[S]$, $R$ is bound and $Y([S])=\\text{OFF}$. As $[S]$ increases, $R$ is removed and $A$ drives activation, so $Y([S])=\\text{ON}$; at high $[S]$, $R$ remains sequestered and $Y([S])$ stays ON. There is no mechanism to turn OFF at high $[S]$, so it is not band-pass.\n\nOption C: $A$ binds $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$ and activates; $S$ binds $A$ to form $S\\!-\\!A$ that cannot bind the promoter. Hence at $[S]=0$, $A$ activates and $Y([S])=\\text{ON}$. As $[S]$ increases, activation is inhibited, turning $Y([S])$ OFF at high $[S]$. This is ON at low $[S]$, not OFF, so it is not band-pass.\n\nOption D: $S$ binds to $A$ and $R$. $S\\!-\\!A$ is the activating species for $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$; $S\\!-\\!R$ is the repressing species for $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$.

There is negligible $S\\!-\\!A$ to activate and negligible $S\\!-\\!R$ to repress, but activation is required for transcription by assumption 2; therefore $Y([S])=\\text{OFF}$.\n2) Intermediate $[S]$: choose $[S]$ such that $K_{A}\\ll [S]\\ll K_{R}$. Then $\\theta_{A}\\approx 1$ (activator is effectively fully in the $S\\!-\\!A$ form) while $\\theta_{R}\\approx \\frac{[S]}{K_{R}}\\ll 1$ (little $S\\!-\\!R$). Hence activation is present and repression is negligible, so $Y([S])=\\text{ON}$.\n3) High $[S]$: if $[S]\\gg K_{R}$, then $\\theta_{A}\\approx 1$ and $\\theta_{R}\\approx 1$. Both activating and repressing forms are present and competent to bind $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$. By assumption 3 (repression dominates), $Y([S])=\\text{OFF}$.\nThus, $Y([S])$ is OFF at low $[S]$, ON at intermediate $[S]$, and OFF at high $[S]$, i.e., a band-pass.\n\nOption E: $S$ activates expression of $R$, which represses $P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$; $A$ is constitutively active. At low $[S]$, $R$ is absent and $A$ activates, so $Y([S])=\\text{ON}$; at high $[S]$, $R$ is present and $Y([S])=\\text{OFF}$.
