{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The DNA sequence of a promoter is a blueprint that dictates its transcriptional strength. This exercise provides hands-on practice in decoding this blueprint by comparing a promoter's sequence to the ideal consensus elements, such as the $-10$ and $-35$ boxes in bacteria. Mastering this analysis is a fundamental skill for any synthetic biologist aiming to select or engineer promoters with specific expression levels for their genetic circuits [@problem_id:2058648].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a student is designing a genetic circuit in *Escherichia coli* and needs to select a promoter to drive the expression of a reporter gene. The strength of the promoter, which correlates to the rate of transcription initiation, is a critical design parameter. The student has synthesized two potential promoters, Promoter A and Promoter B, and needs to predict which one is likely to be stronger.\n\nThe strength of a typical *E. coli* promoter recognized by the sigma-70 ($\\sigma^{70}$) transcription factor is largely determined by how well its sequence matches the ideal consensus sequences at two key regions: the -35 box and the -10 box. The spacing between these two boxes is also critical.\n\nThe consensus sequences and optimal spacing are as follows:\n- **-35 box consensus:** 5'-TTGACA-3'\n- **-10 box consensus:** 5'-TATAAT-3'\n- **Optimal spacer length:** 17 base pairs\n\nThe sequences of the two synthetic promoters are given below, with the -35 and -10 regions shown. The spacer is the sequence of nucleotides between these two regions.\n\n**Promoter A:**\n-35 region: 5'-TTGACA-3'\nSpacer: (16 nucleotides long)\n-10 region: 5'-TATGAT-3'\n\n**Promoter B:**\n-35 region: 5'-TTGAAA-3'\nSpacer: (17 nucleotides long)\n-10 region: 5'-TATAAT-3'\n\nBased on a comparative analysis of these promoter elements against the consensus, which of the following statements is the most accurate prediction?\n\nA. Promoter A is stronger because its -35 box is a perfect match to the consensus sequence.\n\nB. Promoter B is stronger because its -10 box perfectly matches the consensus sequence and it has the optimal spacer length.\n\nC. The promoters will have similar strength because each has two deviations from the ideal promoter structure (Promoter A has one mismatch in the -10 box and a suboptimal spacer length; Promoter B has one mismatch in the -35 box and one in the -10 box).\n\nD. Promoter A is stronger because its -10 box mismatch is at a less critical position than the -35 box mismatch in Promoter B.\n\nE. Promoter B is stronger because an A-rich -35 box is generally more effective at recruiting RNA Polymerase than a G-C rich box.", "solution": "Principle: For a typical Escherichia coli $\\sigma^{70}$ promoter, transcriptional strength correlates with how closely the promoter matches the consensus sequences at the $-35$ box and $-10$ box, and with having the optimal spacer length between these boxes. Empirically, matches in the $-10$ box and optimal spacing are more critical for initiation than the $-35$ box match.\n\nConsensus and optimal values:\n$$\\text{$-35$ consensus} = \\text{TTGACA}, \\quad \\text{$-10$ consensus} = \\text{TATAAT}, \\quad \\text{optimal spacer length} = 17.$$\n\nDefine, for each promoter $X \\in \\{\\text{A},\\text{B}\\}$:\n$$m_{35}^{(X)} = \\text{number of mismatches to TTGACA at $-35$},$$\n$$m_{10}^{(X)} = \\text{number of mismatches to TATAAT at $-10$},$$\n$$d^{(X)} = L^{(X)} - 17, \\quad \\text{with } |d^{(X)}| \\text{ measuring deviation from optimal spacing},$$\nwhere $L^{(X)}$ is the spacer length.\n\nAnalyze Promoter A:\n- $-35$ region is TTGACA, which is an exact match to TTGACA, so\n$$m_{35}^{(\\text{A})} = 0.$$\n- $-10$ region is TATGAT. Aligning to TATAAT shows a mismatch at the fourth position (A in consensus versus G in the sequence), with all other positions matching, hence\n$$m_{10}^{(\\text{A})} = 1.$$\n- Spacer length is $16$, thus\n$$d^{(\\text{A})} = 16 - 17 = -1, \\quad |d^{(\\text{A})}| = 1.$$\n\nAnalyze Promoter B:\n- $-35$ region is TTGAAA. Relative to TTGACA, there is a single mismatch at the fifth position (C in consensus versus A in the sequence), hence\n$$m_{35}^{(\\text{B})} = 1.$$\n- $-10$ region is TATAAT, which is a perfect match to TATAAT, so\n$$m_{10}^{(\\text{B})} = 0.$$\n- Spacer length is $17$, thus\n$$d^{(\\text{B})} = 17 - 17 = 0, \\quad |d^{(\\text{B})}| = 0.$$\n\nComparative prediction: Promoter A has an advantage at the $-35$ box but is disadvantaged at the $-10$ box and in spacer length. Promoter B has an advantage at the $-10$ box and spacer length but a disadvantage at the $-35$ box. Given the greater functional impact of a perfect $-10$ box and optimal spacing relative to a perfect $-35$ box, Promoter B is predicted to be stronger.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is not most accurate because it ignores the more critical $-10$ box mismatch and suboptimal spacing of Promoter A.\n- B correctly identifies the perfect $-10$ box and optimal spacing of Promoter B as decisive.\n- C is factually incorrect about Promoter B having a $-10$ mismatch; it does not.\n- D is not supported; mismatches in the $-10$ box are generally more detrimental than comparable $-35$ mismatches.\n- E is incorrect; the consensus, not generic A-richness, predicts strength, and the consensus $-35$ includes a C at the fifth position.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that Promoter B is stronger.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2058648"}, {"introduction": "While sequence analysis can predict promoter function, experimental validation is crucial for confirming it.

They have isolated a promising, naturally occurring promoter, `P_strong`, and are attempting to identify its core functional domain through a promoter-bashing experiment. The strategy involves creating a series of constructs, each containing a progressively shorter 5' deletion of the `P_strong` sequence. The Transcription Start Site (TSS) is designated as base pair `+1`.\n\nEach truncated promoter fragment is cloned upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter gene.

To test their behavior, the team constructs two separate plasmids. The first plasmid contains promoter `P_A` driving the expression of a gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The second plasmid contains promoter `P_B` driving the expression of the same GFP gene.\n\nTwo identical cultures of *E. coli* are transformed with the `P_A`-GFP plasmid, and another two cultures are transformed with the `P_B`-GFP plasmid. All cultures are grown in a standard nutrient broth. At time `t = 2` hours, a chemical compound, L-arabinose, is added to one culture from the `P_A` set and one from the `P_B` set. The other culture in each set serves as a control with no added L-arabinose. The total fluorescence of each culture, a proxy for GFP expression, is measured over time.

A constitutive promoter exhibits activity independent of $I$, while an inducible promoter exhibits activity that increases specifically when $I=1$ relative to $I=0$.\n\nFor promoter $P_{A}$:\n- Observation: In the control ($I=0$), fluorescence is low at $t=0$ and then increases at a steady, significant rate throughout the experiment.

Therefore, $P_{A}$ is constitutive (it drives expression without requiring induction and is not repressed by L-arabinose).\n\nFor promoter $P_{B}$:\n- Observation: In the control ($I=0$), fluorescence remains at a near-zero baseline for all $t$. In the test ($I=1$ after $t=2$), fluorescence is near zero for $t<2$ and then increases rapidly after $t=2$, reaching a high level by the end. Thus, $F_{B}(t \\mid I=1) \\gg F_{B}(t \\mid I=0)$ for $t>2$.\n- Logical inference: Because expression depends on the presence of L-arabinose and is negligible without it, $P_{B}$ is inducible by L-arabinose.\n\nOption consistency check:\n- A: $P_{A}$ constitutive, $P_{B}$ inducible — matches the inferences above.\n- B: $P_{A}$ inducible, $P_{B}$ constitutive — contradicts observations.\n- C: Both constitutive — contradicts $P_{B}$ behavior.\n- D: Both inducible — contradicts $P_{A}$ behavior.\n- E: Inconclusive due to wrong inducer — contradicted by clear induction of $P_{B}$ by L-arabinose.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is that $P_{A}$ is constitutive and $P_{B}$ is inducible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2058639"}]}
