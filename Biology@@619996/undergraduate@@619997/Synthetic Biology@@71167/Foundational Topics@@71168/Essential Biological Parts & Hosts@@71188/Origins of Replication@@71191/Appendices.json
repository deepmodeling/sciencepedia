{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A key task in synthetic biology is ensuring that engineered plasmids are maintained at a desired level within host cells. This exercise explores the elegant molecular logic of plasmid copy number control through a classic example: the antisense RNA regulation of the ColE1-type origin. By analyzing the effect of removing a key negative regulator, you will develop a deeper intuition for how negative feedback loops create stability in genetic systems [@problem_id:2052743].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a research team is working with a bacterial plasmid that uses a ColE1-type origin of replication to control its copy number. The replication of this plasmid is initiated from a specific origin site. Transcription starting upstream of the origin produces a pre-primer Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) molecule, known as RNA II. For replication to start, RNA II must fold into a specific three-dimensional structure that allows it to form a persistent hybrid with the template Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). This hybrid is then cleaved at a specific site by a host enzyme, RNase H, creating a free 3'-hydroxyl group that DNA Polymerase I uses to initiate DNA synthesis.\n\nThe copy number of this plasmid is negatively regulated by a small, untranslated antisense RNA molecule called RNA I, which is transcribed from the opposite DNA strand in the same region as RNA II. RNA I is complementary to the 5' end of the RNA II pre-primer. When RNA I binds to RNA II, it alters the folding pathway of RNA II, preventing it from forming the stable structure required for cleavage by RNase H, thereby inhibiting the initiation of replication.\n\nA researcher decides to introduce a mutation into the gene that codes for the RNA I molecule. This mutation is a complete loss-of-function, resulting in the cell being unable to produce any functional RNA I molecules from the plasmid. Assume all other plasmid-encoded functions and all host-cell machinery remain perfectly functional.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected consequence of this mutation on the plasmid's copy number within the host bacterial population?\n\nA. The plasmid copy number will increase significantly.\n\nB. The plasmid copy number will decrease significantly.\n\nC. The plasmid will be unable to replicate, leading to its rapid loss from the cell population.\n\nD. The plasmid copy number will remain unchanged, as other host-cell factors will take over the regulatory role.\n\nE. The rate of plasmid replication will become highly unstable, fluctuating randomly between very high and very low copy numbers.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the effect of a loss-of-function mutation in the RNA I gene on the copy number of a ColE1-type plasmid. To solve this, we must analyze the regulatory circuit described.\n\nThe replication of the plasmid is initiated by the RNA II pre-primer. This pre-primer must be processed by RNase H to generate a mature primer for DNA polymerase. This entire process represents the \"GO\" signal for replication.\n\nThe system is controlled by a negative regulator, RNA I. RNA I is an antisense RNA that binds to the RNA II pre-primer. This binding event is the \"STOP\" signal. When RNA I binds to RNA II, it prevents RNA II from adopting the correct conformation for RNase H processing. As a result, no mature primer is formed, and replication is inhibited.\n\nThe concentration of RNA I in the cell is directly proportional to the number of plasmids. This creates a negative feedback loop:\n1.  If the plasmid copy number is high, the concentration of RNA I is high. This leads to strong inhibition of replication initiation, causing the copy number to decrease back toward the set point.\n2.  If the plasmid copy number is low, the concentration of RNA I is low. This leads to weak inhibition, allowing more replication events to occur and causing the copy number to increase toward the set point.\n\nThe problem describes a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding RNA I. This means that no functional RNA I molecules are produced. The \"STOP\" signal for replication is completely removed from the system.\n\nWithout RNA I, there is nothing to inhibit the function of the RNA II pre-primer. Nearly every RNA II molecule that is transcribed will be free to fold into its active conformation, form a hybrid with the DNA template, and be processed by RNase H to initiate a round of replication. The negative feedback control is broken.\n\nConsequently, the plasmid will replicate in an uncontrolled manner. This leads to a dramatic and significant increase in the plasmid copy number within the host cell. This is often referred to as \"runaway\" replication. The copy number will rise until it is limited by the availability of host replication machinery (e.g., polymerases, nucleotides) or until the high metabolic load becomes toxic to the host cell.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\nA. The plasmid copy number will increase significantly. This matches our conclusion. The removal of the negative regulator leads to uncontrolled replication.\nB. The plasmid copy number will decrease significantly. This is incorrect. This would happen if the positive element, RNA II, were mutated, or if the negative regulator, RNA I, were overexpressed.\nC. The plasmid will be unable to replicate, leading to its rapid loss from the cell population. This is incorrect. The core machinery for replication initiation (RNA II, RNase H, DNA Polymerase I) is still functional. Removing an inhibitor promotes the process, it does not halt it.\nD. The plasmid copy number will remain unchanged, as other host-cell factors will take over the regulatory role. While host factors might eventually limit replication due to resource depletion, the primary, specific copy number control mechanism has been abolished. The distinct set point for the copy number will be lost, and it will not remain unchanged.\nE. The rate of plasmid replication will become highly unstable, fluctuating randomly between very high and very low copy numbers. This is incorrect. The removal of the regulator leads to a consistently high rate of replication, not a fluctuating one. The system loses its ability to regulate down, so it will not fluctuate to low copy numbers.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate consequence is a significant increase in the plasmid copy number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2052743"}, {"introduction": "When building complex genetic circuits, we often need to introduce multiple plasmids into a single cell, but not all plasmids can coexist peacefully. This practice challenges you to think like an experimentalist and predict the outcome of a simple yet powerful experiment designed to test for 'plasmid incompatibility', a phenomenon rooted in shared replication control mechanisms. Predicting the visual outcome of this co-transformation experiment will solidify your understanding of how different origins of replication interact within the cellular environment [@problem_id:2052717].", "problem": "A synthetic biology student is working with two different plasmids, `p_RFP` and `p_GFP`, for use in *E. coli*. The `p_RFP` plasmid contains a gene encoding a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) and utilizes an origin of replication denoted as `ori_V`. The `p_GFP` plasmid contains a gene for a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and utilizes a different origin of replication, `ori_W`. The student needs to determine if these two plasmids can be stably maintained together in the same cell line. To do this, they perform a co-transformation experiment.\n\nAn equimolar mixture of `p_RFP` and `p_GFP` is used to transform a population of competent *E. coli* cells. After the transformation procedure, the cells are plated on a rich nutrient agar medium that does not contain any antibiotics, allowing any cell that survives the procedure to grow into a colony. The plate is incubated overnight, and the resulting colonies are then observed under lighting that can excite both red and green fluorescence.\n\nAssuming that `ori_V` and `ori_W` belong to the same plasmid incompatibility group, which of the following choices most accurately describes the expected appearance of the colonies on the agar plate?\n\nA. All colonies will appear yellow, resulting from the co-expression of RFP and GFP in every cell.\n\nB. The plate will show a mixture of purely red colonies and purely green colonies, with very few or no uniformly yellow colonies.\n\nC. All colonies that grow will be red.\n\nD. All colonies that grow will be green.\n\nE. No colonies will grow on the plate because the plasmids are incompatible.\n\nF. All colonies will be mosaic, showing distinct sectors of red and green fluorescence.", "solution": "We analyze the outcome using the principle of plasmid incompatibility. Plasmids whose origins of replication belong to the same incompatibility group cannot be stably maintained together in the absence of selection, because they share the same replication control and partitioning systems. This leads to a destabilizing competition whereby, within a growing clone derived from a single cell, stochastic fluctuations in plasmid copy numbers and random segregation at cell division cause loss of one plasmid, driving the population toward a state in which only one of the two plasmids remains.\n\nGiven the experimental setup:\n1) An equimolar mixture of two plasmids, `p_RFP` with origin `ori_V` and `p_GFP` with origin `ori_W`, is used to transform competent cells.\n2) The plate lacks antibiotics, so there is no selection pressure to retain either plasmid; any surviving cell forms a colony regardless of plasmid content.\n3) Because `ori_V` and `ori_W` are stated to be in the same incompatibility group, cells initially co-transformed with both plasmids will not maintain both plasmids over many generations during outgrowth. Instead, each clonal lineage will tend to lose one plasmid and retain the other.\n\nConsequences for colony fluorescence:\n- Colonies arising from cells that retained only `p_RFP` will appear purely red.\n- Colonies arising from cells that retained only `p_GFP` will appear purely green.\n- Uniformly yellow colonies (indicative of stable co-expression of RFP and GFP in every cell of the colony) will be very rare or absent, because the two plasmids are incompatible and there is no selection to force retention of both.\n- While some sectored (mosaic) colonies can occur if plasmid loss happens later during colony expansion, it is not accurate that all colonies would be mosaic; moreover, the dominant observation on a nonselective plate with incompatible plasmids is that most colonies resolve to purely one color.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the plate will display a mixture of purely red and purely green colonies, with very few or no uniformly yellow colonies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2052717"}, {"introduction": "Beyond plasmids, identifying the primary chromosomal origin of replication, `oriC`, is fundamental to bacterial genetics and for engineering synthetic chromosomes.

The table below shows the average GC-skew values for consecutive, non-overlapping 500 base-pair (bp) windows in the candidate region. The GC-skew transition point, $P_{skew}$, is defined as the starting coordinate of the first window in the sequence that exhibits a positive GC-skew value.\n\n| Window Start Coordinate (bp) | Window End Coordinate (bp) | Average GC-Skew |\n| :--- |:--- |:--- |\n| 3,450,000 | 3,450,499 | -0.08 |\n| 3,450,500 | 3,450,999 | -0.02 |\n| 3,451,000 | 3,451,499 | +0.05 |\n| 3,451,500 | 3,451,999 | +0.09 |\n\n2.  **DnaA Box Cluster Center ($P_{DnaA}$):** The initiator protein DnaA binds to 9-bp sequences known as DnaA boxes. The strength of this binding can be estimated using a scoring model. The consensus DnaA box sequence for this bacterium is determined to be `TTATCCACA`. The score ($S$) for any 9-bp sequence is calculated based on its alignment with this consensus:\n    -   A base matching the consensus at a given position contributes +3 to the score.\n    -   A transition mismatch (A↔G or C↔T) contributes -1 to the score.\n    -   A transversion mismatch (any other base substitution) contributes -2 to the score.\n\n    The following table lists the start coordinates ($P_i$) and sequences of five potential DnaA boxes found in the region.\n\n| Box ID | Start Coordinate ($P_i$) (bp) | Sequence |\n| :--- |:--- |:--- |\n| 1 | 3,450,950 | `TTGTCCACA` |\n| 2 | 3,451,020 | `TTATCCGCA` |\n| 3 | 3,451,080 | `TTATCAACA` |\n| 4 | 3,451,150 | `TTATCCACA` |\n| 5 | 3,451,210 | `TAATCCACA` |\n\n    The effective center of the DnaA box cluster, $P_{DnaA}$, is the score-weighted average of their positions, calculated as:\n    $$P_{DnaA} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{5} S_i \\cdot P_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{5} S_i}$$\n    where $S_i$ and $P_i$ are the score and start coordinate of the $i$-th box, respectively.\n\n3.  **Predicted Origin Location ($P_{oriC}$):** The final predicted location of the origin of replication, $P_{oriC}$, is a weighted average of the GC-skew transition point and the DnaA box cluster center:\n    $$P_{oriC} = w_{skew} \\cdot P_{skew} + w_{DnaA} \\cdot P_{DnaA}$$\n    For this model, the weights are assigned as $w_{skew} = 0.3$ and $w_{DnaA} = 0.7$.\n\nCalculate the predicted origin location, $P_{oriC}$.
