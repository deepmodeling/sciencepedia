{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Successful genetic engineering begins with a solid plan, much like an architect drafting a blueprint before construction. This first practice challenges you to think critically about selecting a restriction enzyme—the molecular scissors used to cut and paste DNA—to ensure your gene of interest is inserted correctly without being damaged. Mastering this strategic selection is a foundational skill for any molecular cloning workflow. [@problem_id:2019766]", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is designing an experiment to insert a gene of interest (GOI) into a bacterial expression vector. The chosen vector is a circular plasmid named `pSYN-1`, which has a total length of 4800 base pairs (bp). The plasmid contains several key features, whose locations are given by their starting and ending base pair coordinates:\n-   `oriC` (Origin of Replication): 150 bp to 750 bp\n-   `tetA` (Tetracycline Resistance Gene): 1100 bp to 2300 bp\n-   `lacZ_alpha` (Alpha-fragment of β-galactosidase, used for screening): 3000 bp to 3350 bp\n\nThe goal is to insert the GOI into the `lacZ_alpha` gene to allow for blue-white screening of bacterial colonies. This requires linearizing the plasmid by making a single cut within the `lacZ_alpha` gene sequence.\n\nYou are provided with a list of available restriction enzymes. The positions where these enzymes cut the `pSYN-1` plasmid are as follows:\n-   `SpeI`: cuts at position 3150 bp\n-   `EcoRV`: cuts at position 1800 bp\n-   `SacI`: cuts at position 3200 bp\n-   `PvuII`: cuts at positions 900 bp and 3250 bp\n-   `BamHI`: cuts at position 3300 bp\n\nThe GOI that will be inserted is a 1.2 kilobase (kb) fragment. Analysis of the GOI's sequence reveals that it contains internal restriction sites for `SacI` and `BamHI`, but not for `SpeI`, `EcoRV`, or `PvuII`.\n\nTo successfully construct the desired recombinant plasmid, a single restriction enzyme must be chosen that satisfies two critical conditions:\n1.  It must cut the `pSYN-1` plasmid exactly once, and this cut must be located within the `lacZ_alpha` gene.\n2.  It must not cut within the sequence of the GOI.\n\nBased on the information provided, which one of the following restriction enzymes is the only suitable choice for this procedure?\n\nA. `SpeI`\n\nB. `EcoRV`\n\nC. `SacI`\n\nD. `PvuII`\n\nE. `BamHI`", "solution": "The objective is to choose a restriction enzyme that both linearizes the plasmid by a single cut within the $\\text{lacZ}_\\alpha$ gene and does not cut within the gene of interest (GOI). The plasmid is circular and will be linearized only if exactly one cut is made. For blue-white screening, the cut site must lie within the $\\text{lacZ}_\\alpha$ region so that insertion disrupts its function.\n\nDefine the interval for the $\\text{lacZ}_\\alpha$ gene as the set of base pair positions\n$$\nL = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} : 3000 \\le x \\le 3350\\}.\n$$\nFor each enzyme $E$, let $C_{E}$ denote the set of cut positions on the plasmid. The two required conditions can be written as:\n$$\n\\text{(i) } |C_{E}| = 1 \\text{ and } C_{E} \\subseteq L,\n$$\n$$\n\\text{(ii) } E \\text{ has no recognition site within the GOI}.\n$$\n\nFrom the problem data:\n- $\\text{lacZ}_\\alpha$ spans $3000$ to $3350$ base pairs.\n- The cut positions on the plasmid are: $C_{\\text{SpeI}} = \\{3150\\}$, $C_{\\text{EcoRV}} = \\{1800\\}$, $C_{\\text{SacI}} = \\{3200\\}$, $C_{\\text{PvuII}} = \\{900, 3250\\}$, $C_{\\text{BamHI}} = \\{3300\\}$.\n- The GOI contains internal sites for $SacI$ and $BamHI$, and no sites for $SpeI$, $EcoRV$, or $PvuII$.\n\nEvaluating each enzyme against condition (i):\n- For $SpeI$, $C_{\\text{SpeI}} = \\{3150\\}$, and $3150 \\in L$, so $|C_{\\text{SpeI}}| = 1$ and $C_{\\text{SpeI}} \\subseteq L$ holds.\n- For $EcoRV$, $C_{\\text{EcoRV}} = \\{1800\\}$, and $1800 \\notin L$, so condition (i) fails.\n- For $SacI$, $C_{\\text{SacI}} = \\{3200\\}$, and $3200 \\in L$, so condition (i) holds.\n- For $PvuII$, $C_{\\text{PvuII}} = \\{900, 3250\\}$, where $3250 \\in L$ but $|C_{\\text{PvuII}}| = 2$, so the plasmid would be cut twice; condition (i) fails.\n- For $BamHI$, $C_{\\text{BamHI}} = \\{3300\\}$, and $3300 \\in L$, so condition (i) holds.\n\nEvaluating against condition (ii), using the GOI’s internal sites:\n- The GOI has no site for $SpeI$, so condition (ii) holds for $SpeI$.\n- The GOI has no site for $EcoRV$, but $EcoRV$ already failed condition (i).\n- The GOI contains a $SacI$ site, so condition (ii) fails for $SacI$.\n- The GOI has no site for $PvuII$, but $PvuII$ already failed condition (i).\n- The GOI contains a $BamHI$ site, so condition (ii) fails for $BamHI$.\n\nTherefore, the only enzyme that satisfies both conditions simultaneously is $SpeI$, which cuts exactly once within $\\text{lacZ}_\\alpha$ at $3150$ and does not cut within the GOI.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2019766"}, {"introduction": "Once a recombinant plasmid is designed, the next step is introducing it into host bacteria and selecting for cells that have successfully taken it up.

The goal is to introduce a plasmid containing an ampicillin resistance gene into a strain of *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) that is naturally sensitive to ampicillin. As a crucial negative control, the student prepares a sample of chemically competent *E. coli* cells and subjects them to the entire transformation procedure (including heat shock), but adds sterile water instead of the plasmid DNA solution. This process is known as a mock transformation.\n\nAfter the procedure, the student plates equal volumes of this mock-transformed cell culture onto two different types of agar plates:\n1.  A non-selective plate containing standard Luria-Bertani (LB) nutrient agar.\n2.

In the mock transformation, sterile water replaces plasmid DNA, so no resistance gene is introduced.\n\nThe relevant biological principle is antibiotic selection: on LB agar supplemented with ampicillin, only cells that possess an ampicillin resistance determinant, typically a gene encoding a beta-lactamase carried on the plasmid, can grow. Cells lacking this plasmid remain sensitive and are inhibited or killed by ampicillin. On non-selective LB agar without antibiotic, viability alone determines growth; competent, viable E. coli cells will form colonies regardless of plasmid status.\n\nGiven the stated assumptions that the competent cells are viable and there is no contamination (i.e., no accidental plasmid carryover or resistant cells), the outcomes follow:\n\n1. On non-selective LB: the mock-transformed cells are viable and not subjected to selection, so they are expected to grow and form many colonies reflecting the plated viable cell count.\n2. On LB plus ampicillin: the mock-transformed cells remain ampicillin sensitive because no plasmid was added; thus, they are inhibited by ampicillin and produce no colonies.\n\nTherefore, the expected result is significant colony growth on the non-selective plate and no colony growth on the selective plate, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2019790"}, {"introduction": "After growing a bacterial culture that should contain your engineered plasmid, you must verify its presence and integrity.
