This method is crucial for early cancer detection from liquid biopsies.\n\nConsider a system designed to detect a rare somatic point mutation. The reaction contains the following components in a buffered solution:\n1.  Template DNA, which includes a vast excess of the wild-type (WT) allele and a very small fraction of the mutant (MT) allele.\n2.  An allele-specific forward primer (ASP), designed to bind perfectly to the mutant sequence but which has a single base mismatch with the wild-type sequence.
