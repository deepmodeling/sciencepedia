According to the design sequence, the plasmid has a total length of 7.0 kilobases (kb). To verify the assembly, the student performs a complete double-digest of the plasmid using two restriction enzymes: EcoRI and HindIII. The sequence analysis predicts the following cut sites relative to an arbitrary 0 kb starting point on the circular map:\n- EcoRI cuts the plasmid at positions 1.0 kb and 4.0 kb.\n- HindIII cuts the plasmid at positions 3.0 kb and 6.0 kb.\n\nAssuming the plasmid was assembled correctly and the digestion reaction goes to completion, determine the number of distinct DNA fragments that will be produced and their respective sizes.

The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a workhorse technique for amplifying DNA, but it's prone to artifacts. This practice problem presents a classic troubleshooting scenario where the experimental result deviates significantly from the expected outcome, challenging you to diagnose the most likely cause based on the evidence from an agarose gel. [@problem_id:2021359]", "problem": "A student in a synthetic biology lab is tasked with amplifying a 2000 base pair (bp) gene of interest from a plasmid DNA template using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The student sets up the reaction with all the necessary components: the plasmid template, a forward primer, a reverse primer, a thermostable DNA polymerase, deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), and an appropriate buffer. After running the PCR program, the student analyzes the product using agarose gel electrophoresis. The result is unexpected: there is no visible band at the target size of 2000 bp. Instead, a single, very bright, and sharp band is observed at a low molecular weight, estimated to be approximately 100 bp.\n\nWhich of the following is the most probable explanation for this specific outcome?\n\nA. The PCR extension time was set too short to allow for the synthesis of the full 2000 bp product.\n\nB. The annealing temperature was set too high, preventing the primers from binding to the template DNA.\n\nC. The primers annealed to each other and were subsequently extended by the DNA polymerase.\n\nD. The plasmid DNA template was heavily degraded into small fragments before being added to the reaction.\n\nE. No dNTPs were added to the PCR mix, preventing any DNA synthesis.", "solution": "Define the expected target amplicon length as $L_{\\text{target}} = 2000$ base pairs. The observed electrophoretic result is a single, very bright, sharp band at a low apparent molecular weight with estimated length $L_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 100$ base pairs, and there is no visible band at $L_{\\text{target}}$.\n\nIn PCR, each cycle consists of denaturation, annealing, and extension. During extension, a thermostable DNA polymerase extends from the $3^{\\prime}$ end of an annealed primer. When the intended primers anneal to their correct sites on the template, the product length should match $L_{\\text{target}}$. However, primers can also anneal to each other if they have complementary sequence at or near their $3^{\\prime}$ ends; if this happens, the polymerase can extend one primer using the other as a template, generating a short duplex DNA product often called a primer dimer. The length of such a primer-dimer product is approximately the sum of the primer lengths minus any overlapping complementarity, so if the forward and reverse primers have lengths $L_{f}$ and $L_{r}$ and overlap by $\\Delta$ bases at their $3^{\\prime}$ ends, then the primer-dimer product length is $L_{\\text{pd}} \\approx L_{f} + L_{r} - \\Delta$, which typically falls in the range of roughly $50$ to $120$ base pairs for common primer designs. Such a short product amplifies efficiently and, because it contains the primer sequences at both ends, it serves as its own template in subsequent cycles, leading to exponential accumulation $N(n) \\propto 2^{n}$ and producing a very bright, sharp, low–molecular-weight band on an agarose gel.\n\nEvaluate each option against the observation $L_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 100$ base pairs with no $L_{\\text{target}}$ band:\n\nOption A (extension time too short): If the extension time $t$ is too short for polymerase speed $v$ (in base pairs per unit time), then the maximum achievable length per cycle is $L_{\\max} = v t < L_{\\text{target}}$. This leads to truncated products of various lengths depending on when extension was halted across molecules and cycles. Such truncation generally produces a distribution of product sizes (a smear or multiple diffuse bands) rather than a single, sharp band at a specific small size like $100$ base pairs. It is especially unlikely for systematic truncation to converge to $L_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 100$ base pairs as a single dominant product. Therefore, this outcome is not consistent with a single bright band at approximately $100$ base pairs.\n\nOption B (annealing temperature too high): Excessively high annealing temperature suppresses primer-template hybridization, reducing or abolishing amplification of the target. In the extreme, this yields no product at any size. High stringency also tends to reduce primer-primer annealing, so one would expect little to no primer-dimer product. Therefore, this would most likely produce no visible bands rather than a single strong $\\approx 100$ base pair band.\n\nOption C (primers annealed to each other and were extended): Complementarity at the primers’ $3^{\\prime}$ ends allows the primers to anneal to each other and be extended by the polymerase, generating a short duplex product of length $L_{\\text{pd}} \\approx L_{f} + L_{r} - \\Delta$, commonly around $50$ to $120$ base pairs. This product contains primer-binding sites at both ends, so it templates its own exponential amplification, depleting primers and reagents and outcompeting the intended $L_{\\text{target}}$ reaction. The predicted gel outcome is a single, very bright, sharp low–molecular-weight band near $100$ base pairs with absence of the $2000$ base pair band. This matches the observation.\n\nOption D (template degraded): Heavily degraded plasmid would yield a range of fragment sizes, often producing a smear rather than a single sharp band. Moreover, degradation of template does not selectively generate a uniform $\\approx 100$ base pair product; instead, one would expect variable nonspecific products or no amplification if fragments lack complete primer-binding sites. This does not match the single sharp band at $\\approx 100$ base pairs.\n\nOption E (no dNTPs): Without dNTPs, DNA polymerase cannot extend any primer. Thus, no new DNA product would be synthesized; primers themselves are typically $20$ to $30$ nucleotides and are not readily visualized as sharp bands in standard agarose gels stained with intercalating dyes. The expected outcome would be no visible product band, not a bright $\\approx 100$ base pair band. Therefore, this is inconsistent.\n\nOnly Option C explains both the presence of a single, very bright, sharp band at approximately $100$ base pairs and the absence of the $2000$ base pair target band, via formation and exponential amplification of primer-dimer products.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2021359"}, {"introduction": "Successfully assembling a plasmid is only half the battle; the final step is introducing it into a host organism like *E. coli*.
