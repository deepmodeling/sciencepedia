To maximize yield and minimize cost, it is crucial to calculate the precise amount of each nutrient. The medium will be prepared in a 1.00 liter batch. Your task is to determine the mass of ammonium chloride ($NH_4Cl$) required to theoretically support a final cell dry weight (CDW) of 1.00 gram.\n\nAssume the following:\n1.  Ammonium chloride is the sole source of nitrogen in the medium.\n2.  The elemental composition of the *E. coli* biomass is such that nitrogen constitutes exactly 14.0% of its total cell dry weight.\n3.  All the nitrogen provided by the ammonium chloride is completely assimilated by the cells.\n\nUse the following atomic masses for your calculation:\n- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\n- Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol\n\nExpress your final answer in grams, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We are asked for the mass of $NH_{4}Cl$ needed to supply enough nitrogen to build a final cell dry weight of $1.00$ g, given that nitrogen is a mass fraction of $0.140$ of the biomass and that $NH_{4}Cl$ is the sole nitrogen source with complete assimilation.\n\n1.

This practice highlights the deep link between the biochemistry of an engineered pathway and the nuanced nutritional requirements of the cell.", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is engineering an *Escherichia coli* strain to produce a high-value pharmaceutical precursor. The wild-type *E. coli* is prototrophic and can grow on a minimal medium consisting of glucose as the sole carbon source, ammonium chloride as the nitrogen source, and essential inorganic salts. The engineered pathway introduces a novel enzyme that catalyzes a critical rate-limiting step: the transfer of an acetyl group from a donor molecule to a substrate. This enzymatic reaction is strictly dependent on the presence of **Coenzyme A (CoA)**, which acts as the carrier for the acetyl group.\n\nUpon testing, the researchers observe that while their engineered strain grows and produces the target compound in a rich, complex medium, it fails to produce any significant amount of the compound when cultured in the standard minimal medium, despite showing slow growth. They conclude that the high flux required through the synthetic pathway is creating a metabolic bottleneck related to the availability of a key molecule not present in the minimal medium.\n\nWhich one of the following supplements is the most crucial to add to the minimal medium to overcome this bottleneck and restore production of the pharmaceutical precursor?\n\nA.

In minimal medium, a prototrophic strain can synthesize cofactors de novo, but a high-flux synthetic pathway can create a demand for the cofactor pool that exceeds biosynthetic capacity, revealing a bottleneck specifically in the supply of coenzyme A.\n\nCoenzyme A is synthesized from pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), cysteine, and ATP via the conserved CoA biosynthetic pathway. The committed and precursor-limited steps derive directly from pantothenate availability. Supplying pantothenic acid increases the intracellular CoA pool by driving CoA biosynthesis:\n$$\n\\text{pantothenate} + \\text{Cys} + \\text{ATP} \\longrightarrow \\text{4'-phosphopantothenoyl intermediates} \\longrightarrow \\text{CoA}.\n$$\nRich, complex media typically provide vitamins including pantothenate, which explains why production is observed there but not in minimal medium. Therefore, the most direct supplement to relieve the CoA-dependent bottleneck is pantothenic acid.\n\nRuling out alternatives:\n- Thiamine (vitamin B1) forms thiamine pyrophosphate, a cofactor for decarboxylation and transketolase reactions, not for CoA-dependent acyl transfer.\n- Riboflavin (vitamin B2) forms FMN and FAD, redox cofactors, not CoA components.\n- Biotin (vitamin B7) is a cofactor for carboxylases, unrelated to CoA availability.\n- L-alanine is a nonessential amino acid for E. coli and is not a CoA precursor.\n\nTherefore, the crucial supplement is pantothenic acid (vitamin B5).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2048918"}, {"introduction": "Modern synthetic biology relies heavily on editing an organism's metabolic network to redirect cellular resources towards a product of interest.

The wild-type bacterium grows on a minimal medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source, along with necessary inorganic salts.\n\nThe production of Synthecin-V and other essential biomass components from glucose can be described by the following simplified metabolic network:\n1.  Glucose is converted through a series of reactions into a central metabolic precursor, which we will call **Precursor-M**.\n2.  **Precursor-M** serves as the starting point for three distinct pathways:\n    *   **Pathway 1**: Catalyzed by enzyme E1, **Precursor-M** is converted to **Intermediate-X**. **Intermediate-X** is then converted into **Essential Biomolecule A**.\n    *   **Pathway 2**: Catalyzed by enzyme E2, **Precursor-M** is converted to **Intermediate-Y**. **Intermediate-Y** is then converted into **Essential Biomolecule B**.\n    *   **Pathway 3**: Catalyzed by enzyme E3, **Precursor-M** is converted to **Intermediate-Z**, which is the direct precursor to the desired product, Synthecin-V.\n3.  A fourth crucial reaction, catalyzed by enzyme E4, combines **Intermediate-X** and **Intermediate-Y** to produce **Essential Biomolecule C**.\n\nFor the bacterium to be viable (i.e., to grow and replicate), it must be able to synthesize all three essential biomolecules: A, B, and C.\n\nTo increase the yield of Synthecin-V, the engineering team decides to delete the gene that codes for enzyme E1.
