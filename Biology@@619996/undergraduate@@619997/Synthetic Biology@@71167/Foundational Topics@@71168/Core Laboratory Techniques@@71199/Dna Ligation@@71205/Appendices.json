The circular plasmid vector is 3.0 kilobases (kb) in length, where 1 kb consists of 1000 base pairs (bp). The student plans to use exactly 100 ng of this vector for the experiment. The linear DNA insert to be ligated is 500 bp long. For optimal ligation efficiency, a molar ratio of insert to vector of 3:1 is required. The average molar mass of a double-stranded DNA base pair is approximately 650 g/mol. Calculate the mass of the insert DNA required to achieve the desired molar ratio. Express your answer in nanograms (ng), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal is to find the mass of the insert ($m_{\\text{insert}}$) needed for a specific molar ratio with the vector's mass ($m_{\\text{vector}}$).\n\nThe number of moles ($n$) of a substance is given by its mass ($m$) divided by its molar mass ($M$):\n$$n = \\frac{m}{M}$$\n\nThe problem states that the molar ratio of insert to vector must be 3:1. We can express this as:\n$$ \\frac{n_{\\text{insert}}}{n_{\\text{vector}}} = 3 $$\nThis implies:\n$$ n_{\\text{insert}} = 3 \\times n_{\\text{vector}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for moles into this equation:\n$$ \\frac{m_{\\text{insert}}}{M_{\\text{insert}}} = 3 \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{vector}}}{M_{\\text{vector}}} $$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the unknown mass of the insert, $m_{\\text{insert}}$:\n$$ m_{\\text{insert}} = m_{\\text{vector}} \\times 3 \\times \\frac{M_{\\text{insert}}}{M_{\\text{vector}}} $$\n\nThe molar mass ($M$) of a DNA molecule can be calculated by multiplying its length in base pairs ($L$) by the average molar mass of a single base pair ($MW_{\\text{bp}}$).\n$$ M = L \\times MW_{\\text{bp}} $$\nSo, for the vector and the insert, we have:\n$$ M_{\\text{vector}} = L_{\\text{vector}} \\times MW_{\\text{bp}} $$\n$$ M_{\\text{insert}} = L_{\\text{insert}} \\times MW_{\\text{bp}} $$\n\nSubstitute these expressions for molar mass back into our equation for $m_{\\text{insert}}$:\n$$ m_{\\text{insert}} = m_{\\text{vector}} \\times 3 \\times \\frac{L_{\\text{insert}} \\times MW_{\\text{bp}}}{L_{\\text{vector}} \\times MW_{\\text{bp}}} $$\n\nThe term for the average molar mass of a base pair, $MW_{\\text{bp}}$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out.

This problem [@problem_id:2031615] explores the fascinating and powerful technique of using compatible, non-identical cohesive ends to create a new, hybrid DNA sequence at the ligation junction. Understanding this principle is key to designing irreversible cloning strategies and appreciating the specificity of DNA-modifying enzymes.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a researcher aims to insert a Gene of Interest (GOI) into a plasmid vector. The plasmid contains a single cloning site recognized by the restriction enzyme BglII. The recognition sequence and cleavage site for BglII is 5'-A/GATCT-3', where the single slash ('/') indicates the phosphodiester bond that is cleaved on that strand, leaving a \"sticky end.\" The researchers have amplified their GOI using a method that adds a BamHI restriction site to both ends of the gene. The recognition and cleavage site for BamHI is 5'-G/GATCC-3'.\n\nThe vector is digested with BglII, and the GOI fragment is digested with BamHI. These two enzymes produce compatible, cohesive sticky ends. The purified, digested vector and GOI fragments are then mixed in the presence of DNA ligase, an enzyme that covalently joins compatible DNA ends by forming new phosphodiester bonds.\n\nAssuming a successful ligation event where the GOI fragment is inserted into the vector, which of the following statements correctly describe the DNA sequence at the newly formed junctions between the vector and the insert? Select all that apply.\n\nA. The junctions can be cleaved by BamHI, but not by BglII.\n\nB. The junctions can be cleaved by BglII, but not by BamHI.\n\nC. The ligation process is reversible, as the junctions can be cleaved by both BglII and BamHI.\n\nD. The ligation results in a hybrid sequence at the junctions that cannot be cleaved by either BglII or BamHI.\n\nE. A new restriction site for the enzyme Sau3AI, which recognizes the sequence 5'-/GATC-3', is formed at the junctions.", "solution": "To determine the properties of the newly formed DNA junction, we must first analyze the DNA ends produced by each restriction enzyme and then determine the sequence created by their ligation.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the cleavage by BamHI.\nThe BamHI recognition sequence is 5'-GGATCC-3'. Its complementary strand is 3'-CCTAGG-5'. The enzyme cleaves between the two G's on the top strand (and by symmetry, on the bottom strand).\n$$\n\\text{Before cut: }\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n5' & - & \\text{G G A T C C} & - & 3' \\\\\n3' & - & \\text{C C T A G G} & - & 5'\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe cleavage pattern `5'-G/GATCC-3'` means the cut occurs after the first G. This results in:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n5' & - & \\text{G} \\\\\n3' & - & \\text{C C T A G}\n\\end{array}\n\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{G A T C C} & - & 3' \\\\\n\\text{G} & - & 5'\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThis produces a 4-nucleotide sticky end with the sequence 5'-GATC-3'. The GOI fragment will have this type of end on both sides.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the cleavage by BglII.\nThe BglII recognition sequence is 5'-AGATCT-3'. Its complementary strand is 3'-TCTAGA-5'. The enzyme cleaves after the first A.\n$$\n\\text{Before cut: }\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n5' & - & \\text{A G A T C T} & - & 3' \\\\\n3' & - & \\text{T C T A G A} & - & 5'\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe cleavage pattern `5'-A/GATCT-3'` means the cut occurs after the A.

The linearized vector will have this type of end.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the ligation of the two different ends.\nThe sticky ends from both BamHI and BglII are 5'-GATC-3'. Because these single-stranded overhangs are identical, they are \"compatible\" and can anneal (pair up) through hydrogen bonds. DNA ligase can then seal the nicks in the sugar-phosphate backbone.\n\nLet's construct the sequence at the junction. We take the end of the vector (from BglII digest) and ligate it to the end of the GOI insert (from BamHI digest).\n\nVector end:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n5' \\text{...vector... A} \\\\\n3' \\text{...vector... T C T A G}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nInsert end:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\text{G A T C C ...insert...} 3' \\\\\n\\text{G ...insert...} 5'\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWhen these anneal and are ligated, the new sequence is formed:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n5' \\text{...vector... A} \\\\\n3' \\text{...vector... T C T A G}\n\\end{array}\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\text{G A T C C ...insert...} 3' \\\\\n\\text{G ...insert...} 5'\n\\end{array}\n\\implies\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n5' & - & \\text{vector... A G A T C C ...insert} & - & 3' \\\\\n3' & - & \\text{vector... T C T A G G ...insert} & - & 5'\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe new double-stranded DNA sequence at the junction is 5'-AGATCC-3' on one strand and 3'-TCTAGG-5' on the other.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options based on the new junction sequence.\nThe new sequence is 5'-AGATCC-3'.\n- **BamHI recognition site:** 5'-GGATCC-3'. The new sequence differs at the first base (A vs. G). Thus, it cannot be cut by BamHI.\n- **BglII recognition site:** 5'-AGATCT-3'. The new sequence differs at the last base (C vs. T). Thus, it cannot be cut by BglII.\n\nNow we can evaluate the statements:\nA. False. The junction cannot be cleaved by BamHI.\nB. False. The junction cannot be cleaved by BglII.\nC. False. Since neither enzyme can cut the new junction, the ligation is not reversible using these specific enzymes.\nD. True. The new sequence is a hybrid of the original two sites and, as shown above, is resistant to cleavage by both BamHI and BglII.\n\nE. True. We must check if the new junction contains the recognition site for Sau3AI, which is 5'-/GATC-3'. The core recognition sequence is `GATC`. Let's look at our new junction sequence: 5'-A**GATC**C-3'. It clearly contains the `GATC` sequence. Therefore, the enzyme Sau3AI would be able to recognize and cleave this site.\n\nSince the question asks for all correct statements, both D and E are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{DE}$$", "id": "2031615"}, {"introduction": "Modern synthetic biology often requires assembling multiple DNA parts into a single, functional construct. This exercise [@problem_id:2031646] introduces the design logic behind advanced, one-pot assembly methods like Golden Gate, which use Type IIS restriction enzymes.

The assembly is to be performed in a single \"one-pot\" reaction using a Type IIS restriction enzyme, a method commonly known as Golden Gate assembly. The $N$ fragments are designed to be ligated sequentially to form a single continuous piece of DNA. This final linear multimer is then intended to be cloned into a recipient plasmid vector. The vector has been prepared by linearization, leaving it with two distinct, non-palindromic overhangs designed to be compatible with the 5'-end of the first fragment and the 3'-end of the last fragment of the assembly.\n\nTo guarantee that the fragments assemble *only* in the correct order (fragment 1, then 2, ..., up to $N$) and with the correct orientation, and to ensure the final assembled piece ligates correctly into the vector, the system is designed such that each ligation event is mediated by a unique non-palindromic overhang. What is the minimal number of unique overhang types required for the entire system (i.e., for all $N$ fragments and their connections to the vector) to ensure this guaranteed, unidirectional assembly?", "solution": "Let the $N$ fragments be labeled $1,2,\\dots,N$ arranged in the target order. The complete assembly, including insertion into the vector, has the following ligation events:\n- One ligation between the vector left end and fragment $1$ (call this junction $J_{0}$).\n- One ligation between each pair of consecutive fragments $i$ and $i+1$ for $i=1,2,\\dots,N-1$ (these are $J_{1},J_{2},\\dots,J_{N-1}$).\n- One ligation between fragment $N$ and the vector right end (junction $J_{N}$).\n\nTherefore, the total number of intended ligation events is\n$$\nJ=(N-1)+2=N+1.\n$$\n\nDefine an overhang type $t$ as a specific non-palindromic overhang sequence on one side and its unique complement on the partner side. By design, each ligation event is mediated by a unique non-palindromic overhang type, meaning each junction $J_{k}$ uses exactly one such type, and its complement is present only at its intended partner end.\n\nNecessity: Suppose fewer than $N+1$ unique overhang types are used for the $N+1$ junctions. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two distinct junctions must reuse the same overhang type. In a one-pot reaction, this reuse creates at least two pairs of ends that are mutually compatible with the same overhang type, allowing incorrect ligations (e.g., a fragment end from one junction ligating to the wrong partner from another junction). Because the overhangs are non-palindromic, orientation is enforced at each junction, but reuse still permits incorrect pairing between non-adjacent parts, violating the requirement to guarantee only the correct order and orientation. Hence, fewer than $N+1$ unique types cannot guarantee correct assembly.\n\nSufficiency: Assign a distinct non-palindromic overhang type to each of the $N+1$ junctions $J_{0},J_{1},\\dots,J_{N}$. Then, for each junction, only its intended pair of ends bears the matching overhang and its unique complement. No other ends in the mixture share that overhang type, so no incorrect ligations can occur. The non-palindromicity of each overhang prevents reversed self-compatibility, ensuring the correct orientation at each junction. Therefore, $N+1$ unique overhang types are sufficient to guarantee the correct, unidirectional assembly and proper insertion into the vector.\n\nSince $N+1$ is both necessary and sufficient, the minimal number of unique overhang types required is $N+1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{N+1}$$", "id": "2031646"}]}
