The DNA backbone is rich in phosphate groups, giving it a consistent negative charge. This exercise explores what happens when a common procedural error is made, providing a powerful, practical illustration of this core concept. Understanding the consequences of reversing polarity is the first step to troubleshooting unexpected results and confidently performing your own experiments. [@problem_id:2038769]", "problem": "An undergraduate student is performing an experiment to analyze a DNA sample using agarose gel electrophoresis. The student prepares a standard 1% agarose gel, casts it in a tray, and creates wells for sample loading at one end of the gel. The gel is then placed in an electrophoresis chamber, which is filled with a conductive buffer solution until the gel is fully submerged. The DNA sample, mixed with a loading dye, is carefully pipetted into one of the wells.\n\nThe final step is to connect the electrophoresis chamber to a power supply. In a standard procedure, the negative electrode (cathode) is connected to the end of the chamber where the DNA wells are located, and the positive electrode (anode) is connected to the far end. However, the student inadvertently reverses these connections: they connect the positive electrode to the end of the chamber with the wells and the negative electrode to the far end. The student then turns on the power supply and runs the experiment for 30 minutes, a typical duration for this type of analysis.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the fate of the DNA sample?\n\nA. The DNA will migrate out of the well and into the surrounding buffer solution, effectively being lost from the gel.\n\nB. The DNA will remain in the well and will not migrate.\n\nC. The DNA will migrate through the gel towards the far end, separating by size as expected.\n\nD. The DNA will be rapidly degraded within the well due to the reversed polarity.\n\nE. The DNA will migrate out of the side of the well and move perpendicularly to the main axis of the gel.", "solution": "DNA possesses a uniformly negative charge along its phosphate backbone, effectively giving each fragment a net charge $q<0$. In an electrophoresis setup with an applied potential difference, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ points from the positive electrode (anode) to the negative electrode (cathode). The electric force on a charged molecule is given by\n$$\n\\vec{F} = q \\vec{E}.\n$$\nWhen the electrodes are correctly connected (wells at the cathode), $\\vec{E}$ points from the far end (anode) toward the wells (cathode), and since $q<0$, $\\vec{F}$ is opposite to $\\vec{E}$, driving DNA into the gel toward the anode, enabling size-dependent separation.\n\nIn the described error, the student has reversed polarity so that the positive electrode is at the well end. Therefore, $\\vec{E}$ points from the wells toward the far end. With $q<0$, the force $\\vec{F}$ is opposite to $\\vec{E}$, i.e., toward the positive electrode located at the wells. Geometrically, this drives the DNA away from the gel interior and back toward the well opening and into the buffer reservoir on the well side. Over the 30-minute run, the DNA will be pulled out of the wells and lost into the surrounding buffer rather than migrating through the gel or separating by size. It will not be degraded under standard conditions, nor will it migrate perpendicularly through the side of the well.\n\nThus, the most accurate description is that the DNA migrates out of the well into the buffer, effectively being lost from the gel.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2038769"}, {"introduction": "Having grasped why DNA moves, we now turn to what we are actually seeing on the gel. A purified plasmid sample is rarely a single, uniform substance; it often exists in different structural shapes, or topological forms. This practice challenges you to interpret a typical result from an undigested plasmid, connecting the physical compactness of supercoiled, linear, and nicked circular DNA to their different migration speeds. Correctly identifying these forms is a crucial quality control step in any molecular cloning workflow. [@problem_id:2038773]", "problem": "A student in a synthetic biology laboratory has successfully constructed a circular plasmid, designated pMOD1, which has a total length of 6,200 base pairs (bp). To verify the integrity of the plasmid after isolating it from a bacterial culture using a standard miniprep procedure, the student runs a sample of the *undigested* plasmid on an agarose gel. Next to the plasmid sample, a DNA ladder composed of linear DNA fragments of known sizes is also run for comparison. After staining, the student observes three distinct bands in the lane corresponding to the pMOD1 sample. Let's label these bands based on their migration distance from the loading well: Band X (migrated the furthest), Band Y (intermediate migration), and Band Z (migrated the least).\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the molecular conformation of the plasmid DNA in each of the three observed bands?\n\nA. Band X is the linearized form, Band Y is the supercoiled form, and Band Z is the nicked circular form.\n\nB. Band X is the supercoiled form, Band Y is the linearized form, and Band Z is the nicked circular form.\n\nC. Band X is the nicked circular form, Band Y is the linearized form, and Band Z is the supercoiled form.\n\nD. The three bands represent a plasmid monomer, dimer, and trimer, respectively, all in the same supercoiled conformation.\n\nE. Band X represents negatively charged plasmids, Band Y represents neutral plasmids, and Band Z represents positively charged plasmids.", "solution": "1) Identify the experimental context and variables:\n- The plasmid pMOD1 is circular and undigested. In agarose gel electrophoresis, undigested circular plasmids typically appear in multiple topological forms: covalently closed circular supercoiled (ccc), open circular (nicked), and a minor fraction may be linear due to random double-strand breaks during handling.\n- A DNA ladder with linear fragments serves only as a size reference; the plasmid bands differ in both size and conformation.\n\n2) State the governing principle for electrophoretic mobility:\n- In agarose gels, migration distance is primarily determined by effective size and shape under the electric field. For a given number of base pairs (same molecular weight), different conformations have different compactness:\n  - Supercoiled DNA is the most compact, experiencing less frictional drag and thus migrates the furthest (fastest).\n  - Linear DNA has intermediate compactness and migrates an intermediate distance.\n  - Nicked open circular DNA is the least compact (most relaxed), experiencing the most drag and thus migrates the least (slowest).\n\n3) Map observed bands to conformations based on migration distances:\n- Band X (migrated the furthest) corresponds to the most compact form: supercoiled.\n- Band Y (intermediate migration) corresponds to the intermediate compactness form: linear.\n- Band Z (migrated the least) corresponds to the least compact form: nicked open circular.\n\n4) Evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because it assigns the furthest band to linear and the slowest to nicked, but misplaces supercoiled as intermediate.\n- B is correct: Band X supercoiled, Band Y linear, Band Z nicked circular.\n- C is incorrect: it reverses the expected order.\n- D is incorrect: although multimers can appear, the common explanation for three bands in undigested plasmid is different topological forms of the monomer, not monomer-dimer-trimer all in the same conformation.\n- E is incorrect: DNA molecules carry uniform negative charge density due to the phosphate backbone; there is no separation into negative, neutral, or positive plasmids under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct identification is: Band X supercoiled, Band Y linear, Band Z nicked circular.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2038773"}, {"introduction": "This final practice integrates our knowledge of DNA migration and conformation into a real-world synthetic biology scenario: verifying a successful cloning experiment. Gel electrophoresis is not just an observational technique; it is a critical tool for experimental design and diagnostics. Here, you will step into the role of a researcher, designing a restriction digest that can unambiguously distinguish a correctly assembled plasmid from a common, undesired side-product, demonstrating your ability to solve practical laboratory problems. [@problem_id:2038756]", "problem": "A student is performing a Gibson assembly to clone a gene, `gene_INS`, into a plasmid vector, `pVector`. The goal is to insert `gene_INS` into a specific site on the vector that has been linearized by a restriction enzyme.\n\nThe circular plasmid vector, `pVector`, has a total size of 3000 base pairs (bp). It is linearized for the assembly reaction using the restriction enzyme `SmaI`, which cuts at a single site located at position 2000 on the plasmid map.\n\nThe DNA fragment to be inserted, `gene_INS`, is 1000 bp long. The primers used to amplify `gene_INS` add homologous ends that match the sequences flanking the `SmaI` site in `pVector`. A successful Gibson assembly reaction ligates `gene_INS` into the linearized `pVector`, creating a new circular plasmid, `pVector_assembled`. An important consequence of this specific assembly protocol is that the original `SmaI` recognition site is destroyed and is not present in the final assembled plasmid.\n\nA common side reaction is the simple re-ligation of the linearized `pVector` without the insert, which re-forms the original circular `pVector`. This undesired product is referred to as `pVector_religated`.\n\nTo verify the outcome of the assembly, the student plans to perform a single-enzyme restriction digest on the resulting plasmid mixture. The restriction maps for the original vector and the insert are provided below. All positions are given in base pairs.\n\n**`pVector` (3000 bp total):**\n*   `SmaI`: site at position 2000\n*   `EcoRV`: site at position 500\n*   `PstI`: site at position 2800\n\n**`gene_INS` (1000 bp total):**\n*   `EcoRV`: site at position 400 (relative to the 5' end of the insert)\n*   `BamHI`: site at position 700 (relative to the 5' end of the insert)\n\nWhich of the following single-enzyme digests would allow for unambiguous confirmation of a successful assembly (`pVector_assembled`) by producing at least two distinct DNA fragments, while the undesired `pVector_religated` product would yield only a single fragment?\n\nA. `SmaI`\n\nB. `EcoRV`\n\nC. `PstI`\n\nD. `BamHI`", "solution": "We use the following principles for single-enzyme digests of circular DNA:\n1) If a circular DNA has zero recognition sites for the enzyme, it remains uncut and appears as a single band (one fragment).\n2) If it has exactly one site, it is cut once and yields one linear fragment (one band).\n3) If it has two sites, it is cut twice and yields two fragments (two bands), whose sizes sum to the total plasmid length.\n\nFirst, determine plasmid lengths after the assembly outcomes.\n- The original plasmid is 3000 bp. Insertion of a 1000 bp fragment at a single SmaI cut site increases the length by 1000 bp, so the assembled plasmid length is\n$$\nL_{\\text{assembled}} = 3000 + 1000 = 4000 \\text{ bp}.\n$$\n- The religated plasmid (vector only) remains\n$$\nL_{\\text{religated}} = 3000 \\text{ bp}.\n$$\n\nNext, count recognition sites in each outcome for each enzyme.\n\nA. SmaI\n- Given: the SmaI site at position 2000 is destroyed by successful assembly.\n- Assembled: zero SmaI sites → one band (uncut circular).\n- Religated: one SmaI site → one band (linear 3000 bp).\nThis does not produce two fragments for the assembled product; not discriminating.\n\nB. EcoRV\n- Vector has an EcoRV site at 500; insert has an EcoRV site at 400.\n- Assembled: two EcoRV sites total (one from vector, one from insert) → two fragments.\n  For concreteness, placing the 1000 bp insert at the SmaI site at 2000, the insert’s EcoRV site lies at $2000 + 400 = 2400$ along the assembled map, while the vector EcoRV site is at 500. The two fragment lengths are\n  $$\n  2400 - 500 = 1900 \\text{ bp}, \\quad 4000 - 1900 = 2100 \\text{ bp}.\n  $$\n  Hence at least two distinct fragments.\n- Religated: one EcoRV site (at 500) → one fragment (linear 3000 bp).\nThis satisfies the requirement: assembled gives at least two fragments, religated gives one.\n\nC.
