This first practice provides a foundational skill: identifying the non-coding intron sequences that must be precisely removed from a pre-mRNA transcript. By applying the canonical GT-AG rule, you will learn to spot the critical boundary signals that guide the cellular splicing machinery [@problem_id:2046491].", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, engineers often design genetic constructs for expression in eukaryotic organisms, such as yeast or mammalian cells. A common feature of eukaryotic genes is the presence of introns, non-coding sequences that are removed from the precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) by a process called splicing. For splicing to occur correctly, the intron must be flanked by specific recognition sequences. The vast majority of introns follow the canonical GT-AG rule, where the intron sequence on the DNA coding strand begins with the dinucleotide `GT` (the 5' splice donor site) and ends with the dinucleotide `AG` (the 3' splice acceptor site).\n\nA researcher has synthesized the following short segment of a DNA coding strand (5' to 3'), which is known to contain the complete sequence of a single, artificial intron flanked by fragments of two exons.\n\n`ATGCCTCAATCGTTCATACGTAGCCGTTGAAC`\n\nBased on the canonical GT-AG rule, identify the complete sequence of the intron from the options below.\n\nA. `GTTCATACGTAGCCGTTGAAC`\n\nB. `TTCATACGTAG`\n\nC. `ATGCCTCAATC`\n\nD. `GTTCATACGT`\n\nE. `GTTCATACGTAG`", "solution": "We use the canonical GT-AG rule for eukaryotic introns on the DNA coding strand read 5' to 3': the intron must begin with the dinucleotide `GT` (5' donor) and end with the dinucleotide `AG` (3' acceptor), and the complete intron sequence is taken inclusively from that `GT` to that `AG`.\n\nScan the given sequence, `ATGCCTCAATCGTTCATACGTAGCCGTTGAAC`, for all occurrences of `AG` to locate potential 3' acceptor sites. There is exactly one `AG` present, in the segment `...GTAG...`, which fixes the intron’s 3' end at that `AG`.\n\nNext, we identify the `GT` dinucleotide upstream of the `AG` to find the 5' donor site. There is only one `GT` in the sequence, found in the segment `...CGTTC...`. This defines the start of the intron. The complete intron sequence must therefore be `GTTCATACGTAG`.\n\nChecking the options:\n- B lacks the initial `GT`; D does not end with `AG`; C and A do not satisfy the GT-AG boundaries. Only E, `GTTCATACGTAG`, begins with `GT` and ends with `AG`, matching the identified intron exactly.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2046491"}, {"introduction": "Once introns are removed, the remaining exons are joined to form a mature mRNA molecule, but not all of this molecule codes for protein. This exercise challenges you to calculate the final protein length by tracking a gene's journey from a long pre-mRNA transcript through splicing and finally to translation. Mastering this helps you connect gene architecture to the structure of its final protein product [@problem_id:2046492].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a researcher designs a eukaryotic gene for expression in a yeast cell line. The primary transcript, or pre-mRNA, produced from this gene has a total length of 1500 nucleotides. This transcript undergoes processing to become a mature mRNA molecule ready for translation. The pre-mRNA includes a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 150 nucleotides and a 3' UTR of 100 nucleotides. To modulate gene expression, the researcher included two introns of 200 and 300 nucleotides, respectively, which are precisely removed during the splicing process. Following splicing, a poly(A) tail of 50 nucleotides is added to the 3' end of the mature mRNA.\n\nThe translation machinery initiates protein synthesis at the first start codon, which is located at the very beginning of the first exon, immediately following the 5' UTR. The coding sequence continues through all the exons and ends with a stop codon. This stop codon comprises the last three nucleotides of the final exon, located just before the 3' UTR.\n\nCalculate the total number of amino acids in the final polypeptide chain synthesized from this mRNA.", "solution": "Let the total pre-mRNA length be $L_{\\text{pre}}=1500$ nucleotides. The introns have lengths $200$ and $300$ nucleotides, so the total intronic length is\n$$\nL_{\\text{introns}}=200+300=500.\n$$\nAfter splicing, the total exonic length (which includes the 5' UTR, coding region, and 3' UTR) is\n$$\nL_{\\text{exons}}=L_{\\text{pre}}-L_{\\text{introns}}=1500-500=1000.\n$$\nThe 5' UTR and 3' UTR lengths are $L_{5\\text{UTR}}=150$ and $L_{3\\text{UTR}}=100$, respectively. Therefore, the coding sequence length including the stop codon is\n$$\nL_{\\text{CDS, incl stop}}=L_{\\text{exons}}-L_{5\\text{UTR}}-L_{3\\text{UTR}}=1000-150-100=750.\n$$\nThis corresponds to\n$$\nN_{\\text{codons, incl stop}}=\\frac{L_{\\text{CDS, incl stop}}}{3}=\\frac{750}{3}=250\n$$\ncodons in the coding region. The stop codon does not encode an amino acid, so the number of amino acids in the polypeptide is\n$$\nN_{\\text{aa}}=N_{\\text{codons, incl stop}}-1=250-1=249.\n$$\nThe poly(A) tail of length $50$ nucleotides is added post-transcriptionally and is not translated; thus, it does not affect the polypeptide length. The given initiation site immediately after the 5' UTR and termination immediately before the 3' UTR are consistent with this calculation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{249}$$", "id": "2046492"}, {"introduction": "Splicing is not always a fixed process; alternative splicing allows a single gene to produce multiple proteins, but it can also have dramatic consequences. This problem explores what happens when an exon is skipped, leading to a frameshift mutation, and challenges you to predict the resulting protein's size [@problem_id:2046487]. This exercise illustrates the critical importance of maintaining the correct reading frame during mRNA processing.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is studying a hypothetical eukaryotic gene, designated `Syn-Prot-A`, which is crucial for a metabolic pathway. The gene's coding information is distributed across four exons: E1, E2, E3, and E4. The start codon (AUG) is located at the very beginning of the E1 sequence, and the original stop codon is located at the very end of the E4 sequence. The lengths of the nucleotide sequences that code for amino acids within each exon are as follows:\n\n*   Length of E1 coding sequence: 120 nucleotides\n*   Length of E2 coding sequence: 100 nucleotides\n*   Length of E3 coding sequence: 212 nucleotides\n*   Length of E4 coding sequence (up to the stop codon): 90 nucleotides\n\nUnder certain metabolic stress conditions, the cell's splicing machinery produces an alternative messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript where Exon 2 (E2) is completely removed. This joining of E1 directly to E3 causes a frameshift in the downstream sequence. Your analysis reveals that this frameshift results in a premature termination codon. Specifically, the first 36 nucleotides of the original E3 sequence are successfully translated in the new reading frame, but the nucleotides at positions 37, 38, and 39 of the original E3 sequence now form a stop codon.\n\nCalculate the total number of amino acids in the truncated protein that is synthesized from this alternatively spliced mRNA transcript.", "solution": "Translation proceeds from the start codon at the beginning of E1, producing one amino acid per codon, with each codon comprising $3$ nucleotides. Stop codons terminate translation and do not contribute an amino acid.\n\nE2 is entirely removed in the alternatively spliced mRNA, so it contributes no amino acids. The frameshift created by the E1–E3 junction causes premature termination within E3, as specified.\n\nAmino acids from E1:\n$$n_{\\text{aa, E1}}=\\frac{120}{3}=40.$$\n\nAmino acids from E3 before the premature stop:\n$$n_{\\text{aa, E3}}=\\frac{36}{3}=12,$$\nbecause nucleotides $37$–$39$ of the original E3 form a stop codon in the new frame and are not counted as an amino acid.\n\nE4 is not translated due to the premature stop in E3, so it contributes\n$$n_{\\text{aa, E4}}=0.$$\n\nTherefore, the total number of amino acids in the truncated protein is\n$$n_{\\text{total}}=40+12=52.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{52}$$", "id": "2046487"}]}
