The functional order of genetic components is not arbitrary but follows a strict logic dictated by the molecular machinery of the cell. This exercise challenges you to diagnose a non-functional genetic construct, reinforcing the critical importance of arranging parts like the promoter and ribosome binding site correctly to ensure successful transcription and translation [@problem_id:2058155].", "problem": "A synthetic biology student is designing a genetic construct to express a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in the prokaryote *Escherichia coli*. The goal is to have the bacteria produce GFP, causing them to glow under UV light. For expression in prokaryotes, a typical functional gene cassette on the DNA requires several key elements in a specific order. These elements include:\n\n-   A **Promoter**: A DNA region that recruits RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.\n-   A **Ribosome Binding Site (RBS)**: A sequence on the DNA which, when transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), serves as the binding site for the ribosome to initiate translation.\n-   A **Coding Sequence (CDS)**: The DNA sequence that encodes the amino acid sequence of the protein. It begins with a start codon and ends with a stop codon.\n-   A **Terminator**: A DNA sequence that signals the end of transcription.\n\nThe student assembles the DNA construct with the following arrangement of elements (read from 5' to 3' on the coding strand):\n\nRBS -> Promoter -> CDS (for GFP) -> Terminator\n\nAfter introducing this construct into *E. coli*, the student observes that the bacterial colonies do not fluoresce, indicating a failure to produce the GFP protein. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and primary explanation for this result?\n\nA. The terminator sequence is positioned incorrectly, which will cause the ribosome to dissociate from the mRNA prematurely.\n\nB. The presence of the RBS sequence before the promoter will physically block RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter region.\n\nC. The mRNA transcript produced from this construct will not contain the RBS sequence, thus preventing the ribosome from binding and initiating translation.\n\nD. Transcription will fail to terminate properly, leading to an unstable, excessively long mRNA molecule that is quickly degraded.\n\nE. The start codon within the CDS will be transcribed but not translated because the promoter sequence is not included in the mRNA.", "solution": "In bacterial gene expression, the functional order of elements on the DNA must be Promoter → RBS → CDS → Terminator for proper transcription and translation. The promoter is a DNA element that recruits RNA polymerase and defines the transcription start site; crucially, promoter sequences are not transcribed into the mRNA. The ribosome binding site (e.g., Shine-Dalgarno sequence) must be located on the mRNA upstream of the start codon to recruit the ribosome and correctly position it for translation initiation. Therefore, the RBS must lie downstream of the promoter on the DNA so that it is included in the transcribed mRNA.\n\nGiven the student’s construct order, RBS → Promoter → CDS → Terminator, transcription initiated at the promoter will produce an mRNA that includes the CDS and terminator-derived sequence but excludes the upstream RBS. Consequently, the mRNA lacks an RBS, preventing the ribosome from binding and initiating translation, so no GFP is produced.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the terminator influences transcription termination, not ribosome dissociation during translation.\n- B is incorrect because an RBS upstream of the promoter does not physically block RNA polymerase binding to the promoter.\n- C is correct because the misplacement of the RBS upstream of the promoter prevents its inclusion in the mRNA, abolishing translation initiation.\n- D is incorrect because there is no reason to expect failed transcription termination from the given arrangement.\n- E is incorrect because promoters are normally not included in mRNA and their absence from mRNA does not prevent translation; the critical missing element is the RBS on the mRNA.\n\nTherefore, the primary explanation is that the mRNA lacks the RBS, preventing translation initiation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2058155"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple on-or-off expression, a key skill in synthetic biology is tuning the \"dials\" that control protein production levels. This practice allows you to quantitatively predict how changes in the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) sequence affect translation efficiency. By applying a simplified biophysical model, you will calculate the impact of specific mutations on final protein yield, providing a hands-on feel for the principles of rational genetic design [@problem_id:2058220].", "problem": "A synthetic biology student is designing a genetic circuit in *Escherichia coli* to control the expression of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The level of protein expression is critically dependent on the efficiency of translation initiation, which is governed by the binding of the ribosome to the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) on the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. This binding occurs through base pairing between the RBS and a complementary sequence on the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), known as the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (anti-SD) sequence.\n\nTo quantify and predict the strength of an RBS, the student uses a simplified biophysical model that assigns a Translation Initiation Score (TIS). The model assumes that the final steady-state concentration of the expressed protein is directly proportional to its TIS. The TIS is calculated by summing the scores for each base pair interaction between the 9-nucleotide RBS and the 9-nucleotide anti-SD sequence.

This \"wild-type\" RBS sequence is:\n`5'-UAAGGAGGU-3'`\n\nTo create a version with lower expression, the student designs a \"mutant\" RBS by introducing two nucleotide changes.

One method to create a random genetic switch involves manipulating the promoter region of a gene. Consider a synthetic prokaryotic promoter designed to control the expression of a reporter gene. The activity of this promoter is critically dependent on the spacing between its -35 and -10 sequence boxes. The promoter is fully functional (\"ON\") if and only if this spacer region has a length of exactly $S_{opt} = 17$ base pairs (bp). For any other spacer length, the promoter is completely inactive (\"OFF\").\n\nTo introduce stochasticity, a mutable poly-adenine tract is inserted as part of the spacer. The length of this tract can change during each cell division (generation) due to slip-strand mispairing during DNA replication. For any given generation, the probability of a single-base insertion in the tract is $P_I = 0.02$, and the probability of a single-base deletion is $P_D = 0.01$.
