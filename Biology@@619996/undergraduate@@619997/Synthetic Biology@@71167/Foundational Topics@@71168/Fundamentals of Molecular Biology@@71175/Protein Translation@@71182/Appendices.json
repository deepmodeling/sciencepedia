The energy consumption of this process is a critical parameter for optimizing the system's efficiency. The system synthesizes a linear peptide that is exactly 20 amino acids in length.\n\nThe synthesis process relies on the hydrolysis of high-energy phosphate bonds from Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). For the purpose of this calculation, the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule to Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate is considered equivalent to the consumption of two high-energy phosphate bonds. The hydrolysis of one GTP molecule to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate is considered the consumption of one high-energy phosphate bond.\n\nThe biochemical steps and their associated energy costs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Amino Acid Activation:** Before an amino acid can be incorporated, it must be \"charged\" by attaching it to its specific transfer RNA (tRNA). This process consumes the equivalent of two high-energy phosphate bonds for each amino acid.\n2.  **Initiation:** The assembly of the ribosomal complex on the messenger RNA (mRNA) to begin translation requires the consumption of one high-energy phosphate bond.\n3.  **Elongation:** For each amino acid added to the growing peptide chain after the first one, a cycle of events occurs. This elongation cycle consumes a total of two high-energy phosphate bonds.\n4.  **Termination:** The release of the completed peptide from the ribosome consumes one final high-energy phosphate bond.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of high-energy phosphate bonds required to synthesize a single molecule of this 20-amino-acid peptide.", "solution": "Let the peptide length be $n=20$.

A wild-type (WT) strain containing a functional `ssrA` gene. The product of this gene, a specialized RNA molecule known as transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), resolves ribosome stalling on non-stop transcripts.

The expression of these genes is driven by strong, constitutive promoters, leading to high and constant concentrations of their respective messenger RNAs (mRNAs).\n\nThe translation of these proteins is limited by the cell's capacity to supply charged transfer RNAs (tRNAs). We will model this competition using the following simplified framework.\n\n1.  **Potential Translation Rate**: In the absence of tRNA limitations, the translation machinery (ribosomes, initiation factors) can produce Protein A at a potential rate of $v_A^0$ and Protein B at a potential rate of $v_B^0$. These rates are determined by the mRNA concentrations and translation initiation efficiencies.\n\n2.  **Resource Constraints**: The cell has a finite capacity for recharging tRNAs. This imposes a maximum total translational flux for each type of codon. For this problem, we consider only Arginine (Arg) and Leucine (Leu) codons as potentially limiting. The maximum sustainable translation flux for Arg codons is $J_{Arg}$, and for Leu codons is $J_{Leu}$. These fluxes represent the total number of Arg or Leu codons that can be translated per unit time across the entire cell for these two synthetic genes.\n\n3.  **Codon Composition**:\n    *   The mRNA for Protein A contains $n_{A,R}$ Arginine codons and $n_{A,L}$ Leucine codons.\n    *   The mRNA for Protein B contains $n_{B,R}$ Arginine codons and $n_{B,L}$ Leucine codons.\n\n4.  **Steady-State Production**: The actual steady-state production rates, $v_A$ and $v_B$, are lower than or equal to the potential rates due to tRNA competition.
