One of the most important modules is the amphipathic alpha-helix, which has a hydrophobic face and a hydrophilic face. This unique property allows it to interact with biological membranes, making it a cornerstone for designing membrane-active peptides and proteins. This first practice challenges you to think like a peptide designer, applying a simplified set of rules to evaluate which amino acid sequence will correctly fold into this powerful structural motif [@problem_id:2059991].", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, peptides are often designed to interact with cellular membranes. A common structural motif for this purpose is the amphipathic alpha-helix, a helical structure with one face composed of hydrophobic (nonpolar) amino acid residues and the opposite face composed of hydrophilic (polar) residues. This arrangement allows the peptide to stably insert into the interface of a lipid monolayer, with its hydrophobic face buried in the lipid tails and its hydrophilic face exposed to the aqueous environment.\n\nYour task is to evaluate five candidate 15-residue peptide sequences and identify the one that is best suited to form a stable, amphipathic alpha-helix for membrane insertion.\n\nFor your analysis, use the following criteria and simplified classifications:\n\n1.  **Amino Acid Classification**:\n    *   **Hydrophobic (H)**: Alanine (A), Valine (V), Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Phenylalanine (F), Methionine (M)\n    *   **Hydrophilic (P)**: Arginine (R), Lysine (K), Aspartic Acid (D), Glutamic Acid (E), Glutamine (Q), Asparagine (N), Serine (S), Threonine (T)\n    *   **Helix Destabilizers**: Proline (P), Glycine (G). These residues disrupt or weaken the alpha-helical structure.\n\n2.  **Structural Stability**: A peptide is considered a poor candidate for a stable alpha-helix if its sequence contains any helix-destabilizing residues (Proline or Glycine).\n\n3.  **Amphipathicity**: An ideal alpha-helix has approximately 3.6 residues per turn. Due to this periodicity, residues wind around the helix, creating distinct faces. For a 15-residue helix, we can define a \"hydrophobic face\" and a \"hydrophilic face\" based on residue positions.\n    *   **Hydrophobic Face Positions**: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14\n    *   **Hydrophilic Face Positions**: 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15\n\nAn ideal amphipathic sequence will have hydrophobic residues exclusively at the \"Hydrophobic Face Positions\" and hydrophilic residues exclusively at the \"Hydrophilic Face Positions\".\n\nBased on these criteria, which one of the following 15-residue peptide sequences is the most suitable candidate?\n\nA.

The stability of this final fold is largely determined by the hydrophobic effect, which buries nonpolar residues in a tightly packed core. This exercise explores the delicate nature of this stability by examining a seemingly minor mutation in the core. By analyzing why changing a leucine to a smaller valine can destabilize a protein, you will gain a deeper physical intuition for the importance of van der Waals forces and optimal packing in maintaining protein integrity [@problem_id:2060048].", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, a team of researchers is engineering a novel enzyme, designated \"ThermoDurase,\" for use in high-temperature bioreactors. The wild-type (WT) ThermoDurase exhibits a high melting temperature ($T_m$), indicating significant thermal stability. To explore the principles of protein stability, the team introduces a point mutation in the protein's hydrophobic core, replacing a leucine (Leu) residue at position 84 with a valine (Val) residue. Both Leu and Val are aliphatic, non-polar amino acids, making this a seemingly conservative substitution. Contrary to initial expectations, differential scanning calorimetry experiments reveal that the L84V mutant of ThermoDurase has a significantly lower melting temperature than the WT enzyme.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical-chemical explanation for the observed decrease in thermal stability of the L84V ThermoDurase mutant?\n\nA. The valine side chain is smaller than the leucine side chain, and its introduction into the tightly packed core creates a cavity. This loss of packing density reduces the stabilizing van der Waals interactions.\n\nB. Valine is significantly more hydrophilic than leucine, which disrupts the sequestration of non-polar residues and weakens the overall hydrophobic effect that stabilizes the core.\n\nC. The mutation from leucine to valine introduces a formal charge into the otherwise non-polar core, leading to strong electrostatic repulsion with neighboring hydrophobic side chains.\n\nD. The L84V mutation prevents the formation of a critical intramolecular disulfide bond that is essential for the high thermal stability of the WT enzyme.\n\nE. The valine side chain is bulkier and more rigid than the leucine side chain, causing unfavorable steric clashes with adjacent residues and forcing the protein into a less stable conformation.", "solution": "We consider the folding equilibrium of ThermoDurase, $N \\rightleftharpoons U$, where the thermal stability is quantified by the Gibbs free energy of folding $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(T) = G_{N}(T) - G_{U}(T)$. Under a two-state approximation, the melting temperature $T_{m}$ is defined by the condition\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(T_{m}) = \\Delta H(T_{m}) - T_{m}\\,\\Delta S(T_{m}) = 0.\n$$\nA decrease in $T_{m}$ upon mutation implies that, relative to the wild type, the mutation destabilizes the native state with respect to the unfolded state; equivalently, for a given temperature $T$, $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ becomes less negative (or more positive). For a single conservative core mutation, the dominant effect typically arises from changes in enthalpic stabilization of the native core through van der Waals packing and cavity formation, with comparatively smaller changes in the unfolded baseline.\n\nLeucine has a larger aliphatic side chain than valine. Replacing a core leucine with valine reduces side-chain volume, often creating an internal cavity (void) in a tightly packed hydrophobic core. This reduces the number and quality of favorable van der Waals contacts in the native state. In thermodynamic terms, this raises $G_{N}$ by reducing favorable dispersion interactions, i.e., it makes the native-state enthalpy less favorable:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta H \\equiv \\Delta H_{\\text{mut}} - \\Delta H_{\\text{WT}} > 0,\n$$\nwhile the unfolded-state energetics are comparatively less affected. If $\\Delta S$ is not sufficiently changed to compensate, the condition $\\Delta H - T_{m}\\,\\Delta S = 0$ is achieved at a lower temperature for the mutant, hence $T_{m}$ decreases. This is the canonical physical-chemical rationale for destabilization by conservative core-to-smaller hydrophobe substitutions.\n\nWe now evaluate the options against these principles:\n- Option A: It states that the smaller valine side chain creates a cavity in the tightly packed core, reducing packing density and stabilizing van der Waals interactions. This directly matches the enthalpic destabilization mechanism described above and explains a lower $T_{m}$. Therefore, A is correct.\n- Option B: It claims valine is significantly more hydrophilic than leucine, disrupting the hydrophobic effect. Both residues are non-polar and strongly hydrophobic; the difference in hydrophobicity is modest and does not introduce a significant hydrophilic perturbation in the core. This does not accurately explain a large decrease in $T_{m}$.\n- Option C: It asserts the mutation introduces a formal charge. Valine is uncharged and non-polar; no formal charge is introduced, so this is incorrect.\n- Option D: It invokes disruption of a critical disulfide bond. A leucine-to-valine substitution cannot prevent a disulfide bond because neither residue forms disulfides; such bonds involve cysteines. Unless the mutation globally disrupts folding enough to abolish a disulfide, this explanation is not the direct physical-chemical cause, and as stated it is incorrect.\n- Option E: It claims valine is bulkier and more rigid than leucine, causing steric clashes. Valine is smaller than leucine; while valine is $\\gamma$-branched and can influence local rotamer preferences, it is not bulkier than leucine and is less likely to create steric clashes when replacing leucine. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is the loss of core packing and van der Waals stabilization due to a cavity created by replacing leucine with the smaller valine, which decreases $\\Delta H$ stabilization of the native state and lowers $T_{m}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2060048"}, {"introduction": "A key challenge in synthetic biology is not just designing a protein that *can* fold, but one that folds *reliably* and avoids clumping into non-functional aggregates. This problem is inspired by the real-world engineering of 'superfolder' proteins, which were designed to have enhanced folding efficiency and solubility. You will use a quantitative model based on surface hydrophobicity to devise a mutation strategy that transforms a poorly behaved protein into a robust 'superfolder' variant, bridging the gap between fundamental biophysical principles and practical protein engineering [@problem_id:2059992].", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists has designed a novel synthetic green fluorescent protein, named 'SynGFP', for use as a reporter in engineered cells. However, initial experiments show that SynGFP expresses poorly and has a strong tendency to form non-functional aggregates.

For the original SynGFP, there are $N=50$ such residues, and its aggregation propensity is measured to be $\\Omega_{\\text{initial}} = +1.5$ (in arbitrary units).\n\nThe goal is to engineer a 'superfolder' variant, SynGFP-SF, by introducing point mutations on the surface.
