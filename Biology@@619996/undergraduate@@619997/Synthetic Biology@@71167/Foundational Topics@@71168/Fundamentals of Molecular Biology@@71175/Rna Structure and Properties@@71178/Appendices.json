This problem explores how a synonymous codon substitution—often assumed to be silent—can alter the stability of a regulatory mRNA hairpin, thereby potentially modulating translation rates.

One factor that can significantly influence the rate of protein translation is the secondary structure of the messenger RNA (mRNA). Strong secondary structures, such as hairpin loops, can form along the mRNA strand, which may slow down or even stall the ribosome, thereby reducing protein yield.\n\nConsider a specific 11-nucleotide segment within a synthetic mRNA: `5'-GCGGCAUUGCG-3'`. This region is predicted to form a hairpin structure where the first four nucleotides (`GCGG`) pair with the last four (`UGCG`) to form a 4-base-pair stem. The three central nucleotides, `CAU`, form the loop of the hairpin. This `CAU` sequence also serves as a codon for the amino acid Histidine.\n\nTo potentially increase the translation rate, a scientist proposes a mutation that changes the Histidine codon from `CAU` to its synonymous codon, `CAC`. The new sequence of the segment is `5'-GCGGCACUGCG-3'`. It is assumed that the overall hairpin geometry (4-bp stem, 3-nt loop) remains the same.\n\nThe thermodynamic stability of such a hairpin is quantified by its Gibbs free energy of formation, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{hairpin}$. A more negative value indicates a more stable hairpin. The total stability is given by the sum of contributions from the stem and the loop:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{hairpin} = \\Delta G^\\circ_{stem} + \\Delta G^\\circ_{loop} $$\n\nYou are provided with the following thermodynamic data:\n- The free energy contribution of the 4-base-pair stem is $\\Delta G^\\circ_{stem} = -35.2$ kJ/mol. This value is identical for both mRNA versions since the stem-forming sequences are unchanged.\n- For the original 3-nucleotide loop with sequence `CAU`, the free energy contribution is $\\Delta G^\\circ_{loop, CAU} = +18.4$ kJ/mol.\n- For the new 3-nucleotide loop with sequence `CAC`, the free energy contribution is $\\Delta G^\\circ_{loop, CAC} = +19.7$ kJ/mol.\n\nCalculate the change in the hairpin's thermodynamic stability, which is defined as $\\Delta(\\Delta G^\\circ) = \\Delta G^\\circ_{hairpin, new} - \\Delta G^\\circ_{hairpin, old}$.

This method measures the local structural flexibility of each nucleotide in an RNA molecule. A high SHAPE reactivity score (e.g., > 0.8) indicates a flexible, structurally unconstrained nucleotide, which is characteristic of single-stranded or looped regions.
