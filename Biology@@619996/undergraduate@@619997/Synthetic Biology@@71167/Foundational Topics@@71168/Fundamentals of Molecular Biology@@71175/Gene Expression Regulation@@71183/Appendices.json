Understanding this principle is key to designing systems that can exist in multiple stable states, a fundamental concept for building more sophisticated biological devices.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is constructing a genetic circuit in a bacterium to serve as a biological memory module. The circuit, known as a genetic toggle switch, is composed of two genes, Gene 1 and Gene 2, which code for repressor proteins, Rep1 and Rep2, respectively. The expression of these genes is mutually inhibitory:\n\n1.  The promoter controlling Gene 1 is strongly repressed by the protein Rep2.\n2.  The promoter controlling Gene 2 is strongly repressed by the protein Rep1.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume that the repression is highly cooperative and effective, meaning that even a moderate concentration of a repressor protein is sufficient to almost completely shut down the expression of the gene it targets. In the absence of its corresponding repressor, a promoter is considered to be \"on,\" leading to a high rate of protein synthesis. Both Rep1 and Rep2 proteins are subject to a constant rate of degradation within the cell.\n\nGiven this design, consider the long-term behavior of the system.

Hence both $J_{12}$ and $J_{21}$ are small, so $J_{12}J_{21}\\ll\\delta_{1}\\delta_{2}$, implying $\\det(J)>0$ with negative trace.

With $n_{i}\\gg 1$, $J_{12}J_{21}$ can exceed $\\delta_{1}\\delta_{2}$, yielding $\\det(J)<0$, so this fixed point is a saddle and therefore unstable.\n\nThe remaining options can be ruled out by the structure of the equations. A steady state with both high ($R_{1}^{\\ast}$ and $R_{2}^{\\ast}$ simultaneously large) is inconsistent with mutual repression, because large $R_{2}^{\\ast}$ forces $R_{1}^{\\ast}\\approx 0$ and large $R_{1}^{\\ast}$ forces $R_{2}^{\\ast}\\approx 0$. A steady state with both low is also inconsistent, because when both are low, both promoters are effectively on, driving both concentrations upward. Sustained oscillations are not expected in this two-dimensional mutual repression system with monotone Hill nonlinearities and constant degradation; the feedback loop is effectively positive (double negative), which generically supports bistability rather than limit cycles. Therefore, with strong cooperative repression, the system exhibits two stable steady states: one with high $R_{1}$ and low $R_{2}$, and the other with low $R_{1}$ and high $R_{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2039307"}]}
