DNA sequencing of the engineered plasmid reveals that a single point mutation has occurred in the gene. The mutation is located within a codon that was intended to encode for cysteine (Cys).\n\nTo help with the analysis, here is the relevant subset of the standard messenger RNA (mRNA) genetic code:\n- Cysteine (Cys) is encoded by the codons: UGU, UGC.\n- Translation is terminated by the \"stop\" codons: UAA, UAG, UGA.\n\nAssuming the mutation occurred in one of the legitimate cysteine codons, how many distinct single-nucleotide point mutations can account for the observed premature termination?

A valid single-nucleotide mutation corresponds to Hamming distance equal to 1.\n\nCheck UGU against each stop codon:\n- UGU to UGA: differs only at position 3 (U to A), so distance is 1.
