A fundamental skill for any molecular biologist is to translate the length of a DNA sequence, measured in base pairs, into its actual physical contour length. This practice exercise [@problem_id:2032969] will guide you through this essential calculation, reinforcing your understanding of the standard B-form DNA geometry and providing a tangible sense of the molecular scale you'll be working with in synthetic biology.", "problem": "A bioengineer is constructing a synthetic gene circuit using a circular plasmid. The plasmid is a double-stranded molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and contains exactly 5,000 base pairs (bp). For the purposes of modeling its behavior inside a cell, the engineer needs to determine its physical size. Assuming the plasmid is in a fully relaxed, non-supercoiled state and adopts the standard B-form DNA helical structure, calculate its total contour length. The axial rise, which is the distance between consecutive base pairs along the central axis of the helix for B-form DNA, is 0.34 nm per base pair.\n\nExpress your final answer in micrometers (μm), rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the contour length of a circular plasmid. The contour length is the total length of the DNA molecule if it were stretched out into a straight line.\n\nFirst, we identify the given parameters:\nThe total number of base pairs in the plasmid is $N_{bp} = 5,000$.\nThe axial rise per base pair for B-form DNA is $L_{bp} = 0.34 \\text{ nm/bp}$.\n\nThe total contour length, $L_{total}$, can be calculated by multiplying the total number of base pairs by the length contributed by each base pair.\nThe formula is:\n$$L_{total} = N_{bp} \\times L_{bp}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into this formula:\n$$L_{total} = 5,000 \\text{ bp} \\times 0.34 \\frac{\\text{nm}}{\\text{bp}}$$\n$$L_{total} = 1700 \\text{ nm}$$\n\nThe result is currently in nanometers (nm). The problem requires the answer to be expressed in micrometers (μm). We need to perform a unit conversion. The relationship between nanometers and micrometers is:\n$$1 \\text{ \\mu m} = 1000 \\text{ nm}$$\nor\n$$1 \\text{ nm} = 10^{-3} \\text{ \\mu m}$$\n\nTo convert our result from nanometers to micrometers, we can multiply by the conversion factor:\n$$L_{total} = 1700 \\text{ nm} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ \\mu m}}{1000 \\text{ nm}}$$\n$$L_{total} = 1.7 \\text{ \\mu m}$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks to round the answer to two significant figures. The input value $0.34 \\text{ nm/bp}$ has two significant figures, and the number of base pairs $5,000$ is an exact count. Therefore, the result of the multiplication should be reported to two significant figures. The calculated value of $1.7$ already has two significant figures (the '1' and the '7').\n\nThus, the contour length of the plasmid is 1.7 μm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.7}$$", "id": "2032969"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its linear length, the three-dimensional shape, or topology, of a DNA plasmid dramatically influences its behavior. In cells, plasmids are typically found in a compact, supercoiled state, but a simple nick can cause them to relax into a larger, open-circular form. This hands-on thought experiment [@problem_id:2032970] explores how these different topological isoforms are separated and identified using the standard laboratory technique of agarose gel electrophoresis, a critical skill for verifying plasmid integrity.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a researcher isolates a 4,000 base pair (bp) circular plasmid from an *E. coli* culture. The isolation protocol yields a pure sample of the plasmid, predominantly in its negatively supercoiled, covalently closed circular (CCC) conformation.\n\nThe researcher divides this sample into two aliquots, labeled Sample A and Sample B.\n- Sample A is kept as an untreated control.\n- Sample B is treated with an enzyme called Nickase I. This enzyme creates a single-strand break (a nick) in the sugar-phosphate backbone of exactly one of the two DNA strands at a specific recognition site on each plasmid molecule. This process converts the supercoiled plasmid into a relaxed, nicked circular (or open circular) conformation, without removing any nucleotides.\n\nBoth Sample A and Sample B are then loaded into separate wells on a 1% agarose gel and subjected to electrophoresis under standard, non-denaturing conditions. Based on the principles of DNA topology and gel electrophoresis, how will the migration of the plasmid in Sample B compare to the migration of the plasmid in Sample A?\n\nA. The plasmid in Sample B will migrate slower than the plasmid in Sample A.\n\nB. The plasmid in Sample B will migrate faster than the plasmid in Sample A.\n\nC. The plasmids in both samples will migrate the same distance.\n\nD. The plasmid in Sample B will be unable to migrate into the gel.\n\nE. The plasmid in Sample B will split into two separate DNA strands, which will not form a distinct band.", "solution": "We compare the conformations and electrophoretic mobilities of the plasmids in Samples A and B under standard, non-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nBy DNA topology, for covalently closed circular DNA the linking number satisfies $L_{k} = T_{w} + W_{r}$ and is topologically constrained. For a negatively supercoiled covalently closed circular plasmid (Sample A), $W_{r} < 0$, producing plectonemic supercoils that compact the molecule and reduce its effective size (smaller radius of gyration), denoted $R_{g}^{(A)}$.\n\nNickase I introduces a single-strand break without removing nucleotides (Sample B). The nick removes the topological constraint, so $L_{k}$ is no longer fixed and torsional strain relaxes. Consequently, superhelical writhe dissipates ($W_{r} \\to 0$) and the plasmid becomes a relaxed, nicked open circle with a larger radius of gyration $R_{g}^{(B)}$ satisfying $R_{g}^{(B)} > R_{g}^{(A)}$.\n\nIn electrophoresis, the drift velocity is given by\n$$\nv = \\mu E, \\quad \\mu = \\frac{q}{f},\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the electric field, $q$ is the effective charge, and $f$ is the frictional coefficient. For DNA of identical length and composition, $q$ is the same in both samples. The frictional coefficient increases with hydrodynamic size, so\n$$\nf^{(B)} > f^{(A)} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; \\mu^{(B)} < \\mu^{(A)} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; v^{(B)} < v^{(A)}.\n$$\nFor the same run time $t$, the migration distance $d$ satisfies $d = v t$, hence $d_{B} < d_{A}$.\n\nTherefore, the nicked, relaxed plasmid in Sample B migrates more slowly than the supercoiled plasmid in Sample A. It will still enter and migrate in the gel under non-denaturing conditions, and it will not split into two separate strands because no denaturation occurs and no nucleotides are removed.\n\nThe correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2032970"}, {"introduction": "The structure of the DNA double helix is not merely a passive scaffold; its geometry actively dictates the rules of molecular interaction.
