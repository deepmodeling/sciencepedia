The goal is to construct a bacterial biosensor. The design involves inserting a gene for a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which will act as a reporter, into a commercially available plasmid vector named `pEXPR`. The `pEXPR` vector contains a gene `bla` that confers resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin.\n\nThe experimental plan is as follows:\n1.  The `pEXPR` vector backbone is digested with two different restriction enzymes, EcoRI and BamHI, to create a linear piece of DNA with incompatible \"sticky ends\". This strategy is intended to prevent the vector from ligating back to itself.\n2.  The GFP gene is amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using primers that add an EcoRI site to one end and a BamHI site to the other end. This amplified DNA is called the \"insert\".\n3.  The insert is also digested with EcoRI and BamHI.\n4.  The digested vector and insert are mixed together with T4 DNA ligase to create the final circular plasmid.\n5.  The resulting ligation mixture is transformed into a strain of competent *E. coli* cells.\n6.  The cells are plated on a petri dish containing Lysogeny Broth (LB) agar and ampicillin for selection.\n\nThe student also prepares two controls: a \"positive control\" where un-digested `pEXPR` plasmid is transformed and plated on an identical LB-ampicillin plate, and a \"negative control\" where competent cells with no added DNA are plated on another identical LB-ampicillin plate.\n\nAfter overnight incubation, the negative control plate has no colonies, and the positive control plate is covered in colonies, confirming the cells, the plasmid stock, and the selective plates are all functional. However, the experimental plate with the ligation mixture shows zero colonies.\n\nGiven these results, which of the following represents the most direct and likely cause for the complete failure to obtain colonies in the main experiment?\n\nA. The GFP gene insert was accidentally ligated into the vector in the reverse orientation.\n\nB. The heat shock step of the transformation protocol was performed at 37 °C instead of the optimal 42 °C.\n\nC. The T4 DNA ligase enzyme was inadvertently omitted from the ligation reaction mixture.\n\nD. The promoter sequence upstream of the GFP insertion site is specific to eukaryotes and is not recognized by *E. coli* RNA polymerase.\n\nE. A mutation occurred during the PCR amplification of the GFP insert, creating a premature stop codon.", "solution": "We analyze the selection logic and the controls to identify the most direct cause of zero colonies in the experimental plate.\n\nFirst, on LB with ampicillin, only cells that acquire a circular plasmid carrying a functional ampicillin resistance gene (`bla`) will form colonies. Linear DNA is rapidly degraded in bacteria and does not replicate; hence, it does not confer stable ampicillin resistance.\n\nThe negative control (no DNA) yielding no colonies confirms that the antibiotic selection is effective and there is no contamination. The positive control (undigested pEXPR plasmid) yielding many colonies confirms that the competent cells, transformation workflow, recovery, and plates are functional.\n\nIn the main experiment, the vector was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, producing incompatible sticky ends to prevent self-ligation. The insert was PCR-amplified and digested with the same enzymes to produce matching ends for directional cloning. Successful colony formation therefore requires ligation to re-circularize the vector with the insert.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Reverse orientation of the insert would still produce a circular plasmid carrying `bla`. Even if GFP were nonfunctional or improperly expressed, the `bla` gene on the vector would confer ampicillin resistance, so colonies would still be expected. This cannot explain zero colonies.\n\nB. Performing heat shock at a suboptimal temperature could reduce transformation efficiency. However, the positive control produced many colonies under the same transformation pipeline, indicating that the transformation step was functional. Moreover, a suboptimal heat shock temperature would typically decrease, not abolish, transformants; complete absence of colonies is less directly explained than by a failed ligation.\n\nC. Omitting T4 DNA ligase prevents ligation of the EcoRI- and BamHI-digested vector to the similarly digested insert. Given that the vector ends are incompatible with each other, the vector cannot self-ligate without ligase; the reaction remains as linear DNA fragments. Linear DNA does not confer stable ampicillin resistance and is not maintained in *Escherichia coli*, so no colonies would be expected. This directly matches the observation and is fully consistent with functional controls.\n\nD. A eukaryotic promoter upstream of GFP would prevent GFP expression in *Escherichia coli* but does not affect the `bla` gene; colonies would still form, albeit non-fluorescent. This does not explain zero colonies.\n\nE. A premature stop codon in GFP affects only GFP expression, not `bla`. Colonies would still form. This does not explain zero colonies.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and likely cause of complete failure to obtain colonies in the main experiment is omission of T4 DNA ligase from the ligation reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2074894"}, {"introduction": "Once a genetic construct is assembled, the cycle moves to the 'Test' phase to verify its structure. This practice challenges you to interpret a common but ambiguous result from a verification digest, where the observed DNA banding pattern does not match the expected outcome. Your task is to apply the DBTL mindset to 'Learn' from this test and choose the most logical and efficient next step to diagnose the construction error before iterating the design [@problem_id:2074945].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a student is attempting to construct a recombinant plasmid as part of the \"build\" phase of the design-build-test-learn cycle. The goal is to insert a gene encoding a red fluorescent protein (RFP), which is 850 base pairs (bp) in length, into a `pUC19`-derived vector that is 2686 bp long. The cloning strategy involves a double restriction digest of both the vector and the RFP gene insert with the enzymes XbaI and PstI, followed by ligation.\n\nA successful ligation would result in a recombinant plasmid with a total size of 3536 bp. To verify the construction, the student performs a \"test\" by digesting the purified plasmid from a selected bacterial colony with the same two enzymes, XbaI and PstI. The expected result on an agarose gel would be two distinct bands: one at 2686 bp (the vector backbone) and one at 850 bp (the RFP insert).\n\nHowever, after running the digest and visualizing the DNA on an agarose gel, the student observes only a single, sharp band corresponding to a size of approximately 2700 bp. This result suggests a failure in the construction of the desired plasmid.\n\nBased on the principles of the design-build-test-learn cycle, which of the following options represents the most logical and efficient *next diagnostic step* to \"learn\" about the specific failure in the plasmid's structure before attempting a new \"build\"?\n\nA. Assume the ligation failed and immediately repeat the entire cloning process, starting from the restriction digest of the original vector and insert stocks.\n\nB.

Design and perform a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on the purified plasmid using a pair of primers that flank the XbaI and PstI insertion site on the vector.\n\nD.

A correct ligation would yield a recombinant plasmid of total length\n$$\nL_{\\text{recombinant}}=2686+850=3536 \\text{ bp}.\n$$\nVerification by a double digest with XbaI and PstI should cut at the two engineered sites flanking the insert, producing two fragments:\n- a backbone fragment of $2686$ bp, and\n- an insert fragment of $850$ bp.\n\nThus, a correct construct should show two bands at $2686$ bp and $850$ bp on an agarose gel.\n\nThe observed outcome after digest is a single sharp band at approximately $2700$ bp. This implies that only one visible fragment is present. Consider the likely scenarios:\n\n1. Empty vector (no insert):\nLet $d$ denote the native distance (in bp) between the XbaI and PstI sites in the parental vector’s multiple cloning site. A double digest of an empty vector would produce two fragments of sizes $2686-d$ and $d$. If $d$ is small (typical for many MCS regions), the small fragment ($d$) would be too small to visualize under standard gel conditions, and the large fragment would run at approximately the vector length, i.e., close to $2686$ bp, commonly appearing near $2700$ bp. This matches the observation of a single band near $2700$ bp.\n\n2. Failed digest (inactive enzymes):\nIf both enzymes were inactive, most DNA would remain supercoiled/nicked circular, which typically migrates anomalously and does not present as a single sharp band at the expected linear size. The observation of a single sharp band near the linear size is more consistent with successful cutting of an empty vector (producing an invisible tiny fragment and a visible large fragment), not with enzyme failure.\n\n3. Successful recombinant:\nThis would require two bands at $2686$ bp and $850$ bp, which are not observed.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent interpretation is that the plasmid lacks the $850$ bp insert and that the double digest released only the small MCS fragment (invisible) plus the large backbone near $2686$ bp.\n\nThe next diagnostic step should efficiently and specifically determine whether the insert is present between the XbaI and PstI sites. A PCR using primers flanking the XbaI and PstI sites on the vector will produce an amplicon of size\n$$\n\\text{amplicon size}=\n\\begin{cases}\nd & \\text{if no insert is present},\\\\\nd+850 & \\text{if the insert is present}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis gives a rapid and definitive readout of presence/absence (and an approximate size check) without the cost and time of full Sanger sequencing. It is more informative than simply repeating the digest with fresh enzymes (the digest likely worked), and more targeted and efficient than restarting the entire cloning or sending the whole plasmid for full sequencing at this stage.\n\nHence, the most logical and efficient next diagnostic step is to perform PCR across the insertion site with flanking primers.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2074945"}, {"introduction": "A correctly assembled circuit that fails to perform its intended function is a classic challenge that pushes us deeper into the DBTL cycle. In this exercise, you are presented with a genetic toggle switch that is stuck in one state, failing to exhibit the designed bistability.

The circuit is designed with two genes, `gene_X` and `gene_Y`, which encode for Repressor X and Repressor Y, respectively. These repressors function to mutually inhibit each other's expression.\n\nThe architecture is as follows:\n- Repressor X binds to the operator site of `promoter_Y`, preventing the transcription of `gene_Y`.\n- Repressor Y binds to the operator site of `promoter_X`, preventing the transcription of `gene_X`.\n\nTo monitor the circuit's state, a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter gene is placed under the control of `promoter_Y`, such that its expression is coupled with that of `gene_Y`. The \"ON\" state is defined by high GFP fluorescence (high Repressor Y), and the \"OFF\" state is defined by low GFP fluorescence (low Repressor Y, high Repressor X).\n\nDuring the 'Test' phase, the student observes that the bacterial culture is always bright green, indicating the circuit is permanently stuck in the \"ON\" state. Even after applying a chemical inducer that transiently forces the expression of `gene_X` to attempt to flip the switch \"OFF,\" the system rapidly returns to the high-GFP \"ON\" state as soon as the inducer is washed out.\n\nEntering the 'Learn' phase, the student must propose a single change to the genetic design for the next 'Design' phase. Which of the following modifications is most likely to fix the circuit by promoting true bistability?\n\nA. Weaken the binding affinity of Repressor Y for the operator site on `promoter_X`.\n\nB. Increase the degradation rate of Repressor X by adding a protein degradation tag to its coding sequence.\n\nC. Increase the translation rate of Repressor Y by engineering a stronger ribosome binding site (RBS) for `gene_Y`.\n\nD. Strengthen the binding affinity of Repressor Y for the operator site on `promoter_X`.\n\nE. Replace `promoter_X` with a strong constitutive promoter that is not regulated by Repressor Y.", "solution": "Let $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ denote the concentrations of Repressor X and Repressor Y, respectively. The genetic toggle switch with mutual repression can be modeled by Hill-type repression kinetics:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt}=\\frac{\\beta_{X}}{1+\\left(\\frac{Y}{K_{YX}}\\right)^{n_{YX}}}-\\delta_{X}X,\n\\qquad\n\\frac{dY}{dt}=\\frac{\\beta_{Y}}{1+\\left(\\frac{X}{K_{XY}}\\right)^{n_{XY}}}-\\delta_{Y}Y,\n$$\nwhere $\\beta_{X}$ and $\\beta_{Y}$ are the maximal production rates, $\\delta_{X}$ and $\\delta_{Y}$ are the effective first-order degradation or dilution rates, $K_{YX}$ is the effective dissociation constant for Repressor Y binding to `promoter_X`, $K_{XY}$ is the effective dissociation constant for Repressor X binding to `promoter_Y`, and $n_{YX},n_{XY}$ are Hill coefficients. GFP is coexpressed with $Y$, so high GFP corresponds to high $Y$.\n\nSteady states satisfy the nullcline equations\n$$\nX=\\frac{\\beta_{X}}{\\delta_{X}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{Y}{K_{YX}}\\right)^{n_{YX}}}\\equiv f(Y),\n\\qquad\nY=\\frac{\\beta_{Y}}{\\delta_{Y}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{X}{K_{XY}}\\right)^{n_{XY}}}\\equiv g(X).\n$$\nBistability requires three intersections of the nullclines $(X,Y)$, with the middle one unstable and the outer two stable. This typically occurs when repression is sufficiently strong and cooperative (large $n_{XY}$, $n_{YX}$) and the system is balanced so that both $f(Y)$ and $g(X)$ are sufficiently steep and intersect in the appropriate S-shaped region.\n\nThe observation that the culture is always bright green (high $Y$) and that transient induction of $X$ fails to flip the switch indicates monostability biased toward high $Y$ and low $X$. In terms of the equations, for typical parameter values the $X$-nullcline $X=f(Y)$ lies too low relative to the $Y$-nullcline $Y=g(X)$, resulting in a single intersection at high $Y$. One sufficient cause is overly strong repression of `promoter_X` by Repressor Y, i.e., a small $K_{YX}$ and/or large $n_{YX}$ compared to the opposing arm, so that even transiently increased $X$ cannot maintain repression of $Y$ once the inducer is removed.\n\nTo restore bistability by a single design change, we should reduce the dominance of the $Y\\rightarrow X$ repression arm. Weakening the binding affinity of Repressor Y to `promoter_X` corresponds to increasing $K_{YX}$, which raises $f(Y)$ for each fixed $Y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial K_{YX}}>0 \\quad \\text{for fixed } Y>0,\n$$\nthereby shifting the $X$-nullcline upward. This increases $X$ at steady state for a given $Y$, promoting additional intersections of the nullclines and enabling a stable low-$Y$/high-$X$ state. This adjustment directly counters the observed lock-in of the high-$Y$ state and is the minimal change consistent with restoring symmetry and bistability.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A (weaken Y binding to `promoter_X`) increases $K_{YX}$, reduces repression of $X$ by $Y$, shifts $f(Y)$ upward, and is expected to promote bistability.\n- B (increase degradation of X) increases $\\delta_{X}$, lowers $f(Y)$, further suppresses $X$, and worsens the lock-in.\n- C (increase translation of Y) increases $\\beta_{Y}$, raises $g(X)$, further favoring high $Y$, and worsens the lock-in.\n- D (strengthen Y binding) decreases $K_{YX}$, further suppresses $X$, and worsens the lock-in.\n- E (constitutive `promoter_X`) removes mutual repression on one arm, eliminating the necessary positive feedback for bistability.\n\nTherefore, the modification most likely to fix the circuit by promoting true bistability is to weaken the binding affinity of Repressor Y for `promoter_X`.\n\nThe correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2074926"}]}
