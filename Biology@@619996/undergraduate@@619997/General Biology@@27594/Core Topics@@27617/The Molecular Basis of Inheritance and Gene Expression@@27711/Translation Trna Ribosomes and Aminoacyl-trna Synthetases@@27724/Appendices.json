These enzymes are responsible for attaching the correct amino acid to its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in a bacterial cell where the native gene for seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), the enzyme that charges serine onto its tRNA (tRNA-Ser), has been replaced with a gene for an engineered, faulty version of SerRS. This faulty SerRS lacks its proofreading active site and can no longer effectively distinguish between the amino acids serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr). As a consequence, it attaches either serine or threonine to tRNA-Ser with approximately equal probability.\n\nAssume that all other components of the cell's translational machinery, including the ribosome, all other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (such as threonyl-tRNA synthetase), and the pool of tRNAs, are functioning normally. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the consequence for the primary structure of proteins synthesized in this cell?\n\nA. Every position in a polypeptide that is coded by a serine codon will be randomly occupied by either serine or threonine, and every position coded by a threonine codon will also be randomly occupied by either serine or threonine.\n\nB. Translation will terminate prematurely whenever a serine codon is encountered in the messenger RNA (mRNA).\n\nC. Every position in a polypeptide that is coded by a serine codon will be randomly occupied by either serine or threonine, while positions coded by threonine codons will be correctly occupied by threonine.\n\nD. The cell will produce proteins where all instances of serine are systematically replaced by threonine.\n\nE. The primary structure of the proteins will be unaffected because the ribosome will reject any incorrectly charged tRNA-Ser molecules.", "solution": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases enforce translational fidelity by correctly charging each tRNA with its cognate amino acid and, in many cases, by proofreading misactivated or misacylated amino acids via an editing site. The ribosome ensures correct decoding by monitoring codon-anticodon pairing but does not directly verify the identity of the amino acid attached to the tRNA.\n\nGiven the faulty seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) that lacks proofreading and cannot discriminate between serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr), it attaches Ser or Thr to tRNA-Ser with approximately equal probability. All other components, including threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS), are normal.\n\nLogical consequences:\n1. At serine codons in the mRNA, the decoding tRNA species are tRNA-Ser, whose anticodons base-pair with serine codons. Because the faulty SerRS charges tRNA-Ser with either Ser or Thr, the amino acid delivered to the ribosome at serine codons will be randomly Ser or Thr with roughly equal likelihood. The ribosome will accept these tRNAs because codon-anticodon pairing is correct; it does not check the amino acid.\n2. At threonine codons, decoding is performed by tRNA-Thr. Since ThrRS is normal, tRNA-Thr will be correctly charged with Thr, and threonine codons will be translated as threonine. Misacylated tRNA-Ser carrying Thr cannot decode threonine codons because its anticodon is for serine codons, not threonine codons.\n3. Therefore, only positions encoded by serine codons become ambiguous (Ser or Thr). Positions encoded by threonine codons remain correctly translated as Thr.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because threonine codons are decoded by correctly charged tRNA-Thr; they are not random.\n- B is incorrect because encountering a serine codon does not induce termination; release factors recognize stop codons, not serine codons.\n- C is correct: serine codons yield random Ser/Thr incorporation; threonine codons remain correctly Thr.\n- D is incorrect because mischarging is probabilistic, not systematic replacement of all Ser by Thr.\n- E is incorrect because the ribosome does not reject mischarged tRNAs when codon-anticodon pairing is correct.\n\nThus, the accurate statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2324992"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of the ribosome lies the peptidyl transferase center, the catalytic core that forges peptide bonds and elongates the growing polypeptide chain.

The system contains functional ribosomes, a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, all 20 types of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, all 20 standard amino acids, a complete set of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, and sufficient Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) to power the reaction.\n\nThe provided mRNA molecule has the following nucleotide sequence:\n5'-AUGUUUGGCAACUAG-3'\n\nA novel chemical agent, 'Peptidyl-stop', is added to this system. Experimental analysis has shown that Peptidyl-stop specifically and completely inhibits the peptidyl transferase activity of the large ribosomal subunit. This agent has no other effects; it does not interfere with ribosome assembly, mRNA binding, the binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosomal A and P sites, or the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA.\n\nThe translation reaction is initiated and allowed to proceed until it is permanently halted by the action of Peptidyl-stop.

A ribosomal release factor.", "solution": "The mRNA sequence is read from the 5' end in codons: AUG (start), UUU, GGC, AAC, UAG (stop).\n\nPrinciples of initiation and elongation:\n1) Initiation places the initiator tRNA carrying Methionine directly into the ribosomal P site paired with the start codon AUG; the A site is positioned over the next codon (here, UUU).\n2) In each elongation cycle, an aminoacyl-tRNA matching the A-site codon binds to the A site. Peptidyl transferase of the large subunit then catalyzes peptide bond formation, transferring the peptidyl chain from the P-site tRNA to the A-site aminoacyl-tRNA. Only after this step does EF-G/EF-2 catalyze translocation, moving the new peptidyl-tRNA from A to P and the deacylated tRNA from P to E.\n\nEffect of Peptidyl-stop:\n- Peptidyl-stop specifically and completely inhibits peptidyl transferase. Therefore, no peptide bond can form at any time.\n- The agent does not directly inhibit tRNA binding or translocation; however, in the normal mechanism, translocation follows peptide bond formation and requires the A-site peptidyl-tRNA and the deacylated P-site tRNA that result from peptidyl transfer. With peptidyl transferase blocked, this prerequisite state never forms, so the elongation cycle stalls immediately after the first A-site aminoacyl-tRNA binds.\n\nApplying these steps to the given mRNA:\n- After initiation, P site: initiator tRNA charged with Methionine; A site: awaits tRNA for UUU (Phenylalanine).\n- The Phe-tRNA binds the A site, but peptidyl transferase is inhibited, so no peptide bond forms; the P-site tRNA retains Methionine (it is not deacylated), and the A-site tRNA retains Phenylalanine (it is not converted into a peptidyl-tRNA).\n- Because the postâ€“peptidyl-transfer state is never achieved, translocation cannot proceed in the normal cycle, and the complex stalls at this point.\n\nTherefore, at the final stalled state, the P site still contains the initiator aminoacyl-tRNA carrying Methionine. This excludes:\n- A (uncharged Met tRNA), which would require peptide bond formation.\n- B (Gly-tRNA in P), which would require at least one translocation step to reach GGC and then move that tRNA to P.\n- D (Met-Phe dipeptidyl-tRNA), which requires the first peptide bond.\n- E (release factor), which binds the A site at a stop codon the ribosome never reaches due to the early stall.\n\nHence, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2324945"}, {"introduction": "Building a protein is not only a complex process but also an energetically expensive one, with a significant portion of the energy budget dedicated to ensuring accuracy. The ribosome's kinetic proofreading mechanism, which rejects incorrectly matched tRNAs, is a prime example of this trade-off between speed, energy, and fidelity.

This process can be divided into three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. Furthermore, to maintain the fidelity of the genetic code, the ribosome employs a kinetic proofreading mechanism that consumes extra energy to reject incorrectly matched transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules.\n\nConsider the synthesis of a particular polypeptide chain in a eukaryotic cell. The energetic costs are as follows:\n- **Initiation**: The assembly of the ribosomal complex on the messenger RNA (mRNA) and the binding of the first aminoacyl-tRNA requires the hydrolysis of **1** molecule of GTP.\n- **Elongation**: For each subsequent amino acid correctly incorporated, a cycle occurs that consumes **2** molecules of GTP: **1** for the delivery of the correct aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome's A-site and **1** for the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA.\n- **Termination**: The release of the completed polypeptide chain from the ribosome requires the hydrolysis of **1** molecule of GTP.\n- **Proofreading**: To ensure accuracy, the ribosome sometimes binds an incorrect aminoacyl-tRNA. The proofreading mechanism rejects this incorrect tRNA after the delivery GTP has been hydrolyzed but before peptide bond formation.
