{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Mastering the Watson-Crick model begins with its two most fundamental rules: complementary base pairing and antiparallel strand directionality. This exercise challenges you to apply these principles in a scenario mimicking DNA synthesis, where a new strand is built upon a template. Accurately predicting the new sequence is a core skill essential for understanding everything from DNA replication to genetic engineering techniques like the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). [@problem_id:2345481]", "problem": "During a molecular biology experiment involving DNA synthesis, a DNA polymerase enzyme is actively creating a new strand of DNA complementary to a provided single-stranded template. The template oligonucleotide has the sequence 5'-ATGCGT-3'. Based on the fundamental principles of the Watson-Crick model of DNA structure, which of the following options correctly represents the sequence and orientation of the newly synthesized complementary strand?\n\nA. 5'-TACGCA-3'\n\nB. 3'-ACGCAT-5'\n\nC. 5'-ATGCGT-3'\n\nD. 5'-ACGCAT-3'", "solution": "The solution to this problem requires applying two fundamental principles of DNA structure and synthesis: the rule of complementary base pairing and the antiparallel nature of the DNA double helix.\n\nStep 1: Understand Complementary Base Pairing.\nIn the Watson-Crick model of DNA, specific nitrogenous bases pair with each other. Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) always pairs with Cytosine (C). We can use this rule to determine the sequence of bases in the new strand.\n\nThe template strand is given as:\n5'- A T G C G T -3'\n\nApplying the pairing rules to each base in the template:\n- The base complementary to A is T.\n- The base complementary to T is A.\n- The base complementary to G is C.\n- The base complementary to C is G.\n- The base complementary to G is C.\n- The base complementary to T is A.\n\nSo, the sequence of complementary bases is T-A-C-G-C-A.\n\nStep 2: Understand the Antiparallel Orientation.\nDNA strands are antiparallel, meaning they run in opposite directions. If one strand is oriented in the 5' to 3' direction, its complementary strand must be oriented in the 3' to 5' direction relative to it.\n\nThe template strand is given in the 5' to 3' direction:\nTemplate: 5'- A T G C G T -3'\n\nTherefore, the new strand, as it pairs with the template, will have a 3' to 5' orientation:\nTemplate:   5'- A T G C G T -3'\nComplement: 3'- T A C G C A -5'\n\nStep 3: Convention for Writing DNA Sequences.\nBy scientific convention, single-stranded DNA sequences are written in the 5' to 3' direction unless specified otherwise. DNA polymerase also synthesizes new DNA in the 5' to 3' direction. The question asks for the sequence and orientation of the *newly synthesized strand*. To express our result from Step 2 in the standard 5' to 3' notation, we must read the sequence 3'-TACGCA-5' from right to left (from its 5' end to its 3' end).\n\nReading 3'-TACGCA-5' from the 5' end gives:\n5'- A C G C A T -3'\n\nStep 4: Compare with the Options.\nWe now compare our derived sequence and orientation with the given choices:\nA. 5'-TACGCA-3': This sequence is complementary but runs parallel to the template, which is incorrect. This mistake arises from forgetting the antiparallel nature of DNA.\nB. 3'-ACGCAT-5': This has the correct sequence of bases but is written in the 3' to 5' direction. While technically representing the same molecule as the correct answer, it's not the conventional way to write the final product. More importantly, reading this from the 5' end (right to left) would give 5'-TACGCA-3', which is the incorrect sequence found in option A.\nC. 5'-ATGCGT-3': This is identical to the template strand, not the complementary strand.\nD. 5'-ACGCAT-3': This sequence is both complementary and antiparallel to the template, and it is written in the standard 5' to 3' direction. This matches our derived result.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2345481"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its sequence, a DNA molecule's physical and chemical properties, such as its length and thermal stability, are crucial to its function. This problem integrates multiple concepts, asking you to connect the physical length of a B-DNA segment to its base composition and then to the total number of hydrogen bonds holding it together.
