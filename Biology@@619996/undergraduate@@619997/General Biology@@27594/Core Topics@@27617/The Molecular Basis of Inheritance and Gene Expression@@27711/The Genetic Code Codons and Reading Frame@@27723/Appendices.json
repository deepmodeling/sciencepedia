The DNA template strand is `3'-TACGCTCTACCATCGATT-5'`. Transcription synthesizes an mRNA strand that is complementary to the template strand and runs in the opposite direction (5' to 3'). The base-pairing rules for transcription are: A in DNA pairs with U in RNA, T in DNA pairs with A in RNA, C in DNA pairs with G in RNA, and G in DNA pairs with C in RNA.\n\nLet's transcribe the DNA sequence base by base:\nDNA template (3' -> 5'): T A C G C T C T A C C A T C G A T T\nmRNA complement (5' -> 3'): A U G C G A G A U G G U A G C U A A\n\nSo, the resulting mRNA sequence is `5'-AUGCGAGAGGUAGCUAA-3'`.\n\nNext, we will translate this mRNA sequence in two different reading frames to find the sequences for P1 and P2.\n\n**Protein 1 (P1) from Reading Frame 1:**\nReading Frame 1 starts from the first nucleotide of the mRNA.

Therefore, the amino acid sequence for Protein 1 is Met-Arg-Asp-Gly-Ser.\n\n**Protein 2 (P2) from Reading Frame 2:**\nReading Frame 2 is shifted by one nucleotide, so translation starts from the second nucleotide of the mRNA sequence. We ignore the first base ('A') and group the rest of the sequence into codons.\nmRNA: `5'-A UGC GAG AUG GUA GCU AA-3'`\nCodons: $\\text{UGC}$, $\\text{GAG}$, $\\text{AUG}$, $\\text{GUA}$, $\\text{GCU}$\n\nThe last two nucleotides (`AA`) do not form a complete codon, so they are not translated.

The polypeptide chain ends because the mRNA sequence ends. Therefore, the amino acid sequence for Protein 2 is Cys-Glu-Met-Val-Ala.\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\n- P1: Met-Arg-Asp-Gly-Ser\n- P2: Cys-Glu-Met-Val-Ala\n\nThis pair matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2319860"}, {"introduction": "Mutations that alter the reading frame, such as nucleotide deletions, can have drastic consequences on the resulting protein.

This thought experiment [@problem_id:2319841] moves beyond simple sequence changes to explore the biochemical consequences of substituting an amino acid within a protein's hydrophobic core. By comparing a conservative substitution (leucine to isoleucine) with a non-conservative one (leucine to arginine), you will apply principles of protein folding to predict which change is more likely to disrupt the protein's stability.", "problem": "A hypothetical globular protein, named \"Compactin,\" functions in the aqueous environment of the cell's cytoplasm. Its stable tertiary structure is maintained by a tightly packed hydrophobic core, which is shielded from water. A specific codon within the gene for Compactin codes for a leucine residue that is situated deep within this hydrophobic core.\n\nResearchers have identified two different, independent single-point mutations at this specific codon.\n- **Mutation X**: This mutation changes the codon, causing the original leucine residue to be replaced by an isoleucine residue.\n- **Mutation Y**: This mutation changes the codon, causing the original leucine residue to be replaced by an arginine residue.\n\nFor your reference, the relevant properties of these amino acids are:\n- **Leucine**: Side chain is nonpolar and hydrophobic.\n- **Isoleucine**: Side chain is nonpolar and hydrophobic.\n- **Arginine**: Side chain is polar, hydrophilic, and carries a positive charge at physiological pH.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of protein folding and stability, which of the following statements provides the most accurate prediction and reasoning for the structural consequences of these mutations?\n\nA. Mutation X will be more disruptive because isoleucine and leucine are structural isomers, and this subtle change in shape will create a significant steric conflict within the tightly packed core that cannot be accommodated.\n\nB. Mutation Y will be more disruptive because replacing a nonpolar residue with a chemically dissimilar polar and charged residue in the hydrophobic core is energetically highly unfavorable, likely causing the protein to misfold.\n\nC. Both mutations will be equally disruptive because any change to the primary amino acid sequence, regardless of the nature of the a_mino acid, fundamentally alters the protein's identity and will lead to a complete loss of function.\n\nD. Mutation Y will be more disruptive primarily because arginine is a significantly larger amino acid than leucine, and this increase in volume alone will be sufficient to break apart the protein's tertiary structure.\n\nE. Mutation X will be more disruptive because the change from leucine to isoleucine is known to cause a frameshift in the reading of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), leading to a completely new and non-functional sequence of amino acids downstream.", "solution": "We identify the relevant physical principle governing protein stability as the thermodynamics of folding in aqueous solution, where burial of nonpolar surface area in a low-dielectric core is stabilizing (hydrophobic effect), while burial of polar or charged groups without compensating interactions is destabilizing due to desolvation and electrostatic penalties. The folding free energy is given by $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}=\\Delta H - T\\Delta S$, and substitutions that increase the enthalpic penalty of burying a side chain or reduce favorable hydrophobic packing will increase $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ (i.e., destabilize the folded state).\n\nFor a charged group buried in the hydrophobic core (low dielectric $\\epsilon_{\\text{in}}$), the desolvation/electrostatic cost can be estimated by the Born model. The solvation free energy of an ion of charge $q$ and effective radius $r$ in a medium with dielectric constant $\\epsilon$ is\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{solv}} = -\\frac{q^{2}}{8\\pi \\epsilon_{0} r}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right).\n$$\nMoving a charge from high dielectric (water, $\\epsilon_{\\text{out}}$) to low dielectric (protein core, $\\epsilon_{\\text{in}}$) incurs a positive free energy cost\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G = \\frac{q^{2}}{8\\pi \\epsilon_{0} r}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\text{in}}}-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\text{out}}}\\right),\n$$\nwhich is large because $\\epsilon_{\\text{in}} \\ll \\epsilon_{\\text{out}}$. Thus, introducing a charged side chain into the hydrophobic core is energetically highly unfavorable unless specific stabilizing interactions (e.g., salt bridges, hydrogen bonds) are present to compensate, which is unlikely deep in a tightly packed core.\n\nEvaluate Mutation X (Leu to Ile): leucine and isoleucine both have nonpolar, hydrophobic side chains of similar volume and shape and occupy similar rotameric space in cores. This is a conservative substitution that generally preserves hydrophobic packing. Any steric differences are typically accommodated by minor side-chain rotamer adjustments and do not impose a large change in $\\Delta H$ or $\\Delta S$ for folding. Therefore, a severe steric conflict that cannot be accommodated is unlikely.\n\nEvaluate Mutation Y (Leu to Arg): replacing a nonpolar side chain with arginine introduces a polar, positively charged guanidinium group. Burial of this charge in the low-dielectric core removes favorable interactions with water and creates unsatisfied polar/charged functionality, adding a large positive enthalpic term and desolvation penalty as quantified above. This increases $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$, destabilizing the native state and often leading to misfolding or reorganization to expose the charge.\n\nEvaluate distractors:\n- Statement A overstates steric incompatibility for a conservative Leu-to-Ile change; such substitutions are typically well tolerated in hydrophobic cores.\n- Statement C is incorrect because many conservative substitutions do not equally disrupt function; effects depend on chemical similarity and context.\n- Statement D cites size as the primary reason, but the dominant destabilizing factor is the polarity/charge in a low-dielectric environment, not merely volume.\n- Statement E is incorrect because a single-point substitution does not cause a frameshift; frameshifts require insertion or deletion of nucleotides not divisible by three.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction and reasoning is that Mutation Y is more disruptive due to the energetic penalty of burying a charged, polar side chain in the hydrophobic core.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2319841"}]}
