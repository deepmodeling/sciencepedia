Before we can explore the complex regulation of this process, we must be fluent in its fundamental language: how the genetic information encoded in DNA is transcribed into an RNA message. This exercise asks you to work backward from a known mRNA transcript to identify its parent DNA template, a skill that reinforces the critical concepts of complementarity and strand polarity [@problem_id:2324799].", "problem": "A researcher in a molecular genetics lab has isolated a short segment of a gene from a eukaryotic organism. The sequence of the double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is determined.

The sequence of the mRNA is found to be:\n\n- **mRNA transcript:** 5'- GCU AUA GGC CAU UGA -3'\n\nBased on the provided sequences, which of the following statements correctly identifies the role of each DNA strand during the transcription of this gene segment?\n\nA. Strand A served as the template strand.\n\nB. Strand B served as the template strand.\n\nC. Both Strand A and Strand B were used as templates in an alternating fashion to produce the final mRNA.\n\nD. Neither Strand A nor Strand B could have produced the given mRNA transcript.", "solution": "Principle: During transcription, RNA polymerase reads the DNA template strand in the $3^{\\prime} \\rightarrow 5^{\\prime}$ direction and synthesizes mRNA in the $5^{\\prime} \\rightarrow 3^{\\prime}$ direction. The mRNA is Watson–Crick complementary to the template strand with base-pairing rules $A \\leftrightarrow U$, $T \\leftrightarrow A$, $C \\leftrightarrow G$, and $G \\leftrightarrow C$. The non-template (coding) DNA strand has the same sequence as the mRNA except that DNA uses $T$ where RNA uses $U$, and both are written $5^{\\prime} \\rightarrow 3^{\\prime}$.\n\nGiven:\nStrand A: $5^{\\prime}$- GCT ATA GGC CAT TGA -$3^{\\prime}$\nStrand B: $3^{\\prime}$- CGA TAT CCG GTA ACT -$5^{\\prime}$\nmRNA: $5^{\\prime}$- GCU AUA GGC CAU UGA -$3^{\\prime}$\n\nStep 1: Compare the mRNA to Strand A as a candidate coding strand. Replace $T$ with $U$ in Strand A written $5^{\\prime} \\rightarrow 3^{\\prime}$:\nStrand A with $T \\rightarrow U$: $5^{\\prime}$- GCU AUA GGC CAU UGA -$3^{\\prime}$.\nThis exactly matches the given mRNA sequence and polarity. Therefore, Strand A is the coding (non-template) strand.\n\nStep 2: Deduce the template strand. The template must be the complement of the mRNA and antiparallel. Strand B is given as $3^{\\prime}$- CGA TAT CCG GTA ACT -$5^{\\prime}$. Applying base-pairing to generate mRNA $5^{\\prime} \\rightarrow 3^{\\prime}$:\n$C \\rightarrow G$, $G \\rightarrow C$, $A \\rightarrow U$, $T \\rightarrow A$, continuing across the sequence yields $5^{\\prime}$- GCU AUA GGC CAU UGA -$3^{\\prime}$, which matches the mRNA. Hence, Strand B functioned as the template strand.\n\nConclusion: Strand B is the template strand; Strand A is the coding strand.

The 'strength' of a promoter, its ability to recruit RNA polymerase, is a key determinant of gene expression that can be described thermodynamically. This problem takes you beyond a qualitative understanding by using a simplified model to quantify how mutations impact binding energy ($\\Delta G_{bind}$) and, consequently, the rate of transcription initiation [@problem_id:2051480].", "problem": "In a study of bacterial gene expression in *Escherichia coli*, a biochemist investigates the effect of promoter sequence on transcription initiation efficiency. The strength of a promoter is largely determined by its similarity to the consensus sequences at the -35 and -10 regions, which are critical for binding the sigma factor subunit of the RNA Polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme.\n\nThe consensus sequences for a typical *E. coli* promoter are:\n- -35 region: TTGACA\n- -10 region: TATAAT\n\nThe biochemist compares two synthetic promoters, Promoter C (for Consensus) and Promoter M (for Mismatched).\n- **Promoter C** has a sequence that perfectly matches the -35 and -10 consensus sequences.\n- **Promoter M** has the following sequences:\n  - -35 region: TT**C**ACA\n  - -10 region: TA**C**AAT\n\nIn the experimental conditions, the intracellular concentration of free RNAP is low, such that the rate of transcription initiation is directly proportional to the fraction of time the promoter is bound by an RNAP holoenzyme.

This practice explores Rho-independent termination, a mechanism that relies on the physical structure of the nascent RNA itself. By analyzing a hypothetical mutation that disrupts the formation of a key terminator hairpin, you will predict the consequences for the final transcript, reinforcing the importance of secondary structure in biological processes [@problem_id:1530420].", "problem": "In a prokaryotic organism, the transcription of a gene, designated `gene_alpha`, is regulated by a rho-independent termination mechanism. The 3' untranslated region of the wild-type `gene_alpha` contains a specific sequence on the non-template DNA strand that facilitates termination. This sequence is `5'-...AGGCGCCCGC...GCGGGCGCCT-TTTTTTTT...-3'`, where the ellipsis (...) represents the intervening sequences. Biochemical analysis reveals the existence of a weaker, alternative rho-independent terminator located 250 base pairs downstream from the primary `gene_alpha` terminator.\n\nA research team induces a point substitution mutation in `gene_alpha`, creating a mutant allele.

The mutant mRNA will be rapidly degraded because it lacks a proper termination signal.", "solution": "Rho-independent transcription termination in prokaryotes requires two features in the nascent RNA: (i) a GC-rich inverted repeat that can fold into a stable stem-loop (hairpin), and (ii) a downstream run of uridines that base-pair with a corresponding run of adenines on the template DNA, forming a weak rU–dA RNA–DNA hybrid. The hairpin causes RNA polymerase pausing and destabilizes the transcription complex in concert with the weak rU–dA hybrid, triggering termination.\n\nThe sequence provided is from the non-template (coding) DNA strand, so its RNA counterpart is identical except that T is replaced by U. The wild-type terminator segment includes a GC-rich inverted repeat, here represented by the two elements flanking the spacer, exemplified by the portion “...AGGCGCCCGC...GCGGGCGCCT...” followed by a poly-T tract “-TTTTTTTT-”. The two GC-rich elements can base-pair in the RNA to form the stem of the hairpin; the downstream T tract on the coding strand yields a U tract in the RNA.\n\nIn the mutant allele, the segment “GCGGGCGCCT” is changed to “GATTACAATT”. This substitution disrupts the GC-rich inverted repeat necessary to form a stable hairpin because it removes complementarity to the upstream GC-rich segment and replaces it with an AT-rich, non-complementary sequence. Although the downstream poly-T tract remains intact, the hairpin cannot form. Without the hairpin, the weak rU–dA hybrid alone is insufficient to efficiently terminate transcription at the primary site, so RNA polymerase reads through.\n\nThe problem states that there is a weaker, alternative rho-independent terminator located 250 base pairs downstream, and that this alternative terminator remains unchanged. In the absence of termination at the primary site, transcription will continue until this downstream alternative terminator is encountered, where termination will occur. Because the mutation does not affect mRNA stability, the transcript will not be preferentially degraded; rather, its length will be extended by approximately the distance between the primary and the alternative terminators.\n\nTherefore, the mRNA produced from the mutant allele will be approximately 250 nucleotides longer than the wild-type transcript.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1530420"}]}
