At the heart of this process in an aqueous environment is the hydrophobic effect. This first practice problem [@problem_id:2310254] provides a foundational thought experiment, asking you to predict the initial conformational change for a simple, synthetic polypeptide as it encounters water. By analyzing this scenario, you'll develop a core intuition for why nonpolar amino acids tend to be buried away from water, a fundamental principle that governs the architecture of nearly all globular proteins.", "problem": "A research team in synthetic biology has designed and synthesized a short polypeptide consisting of 12 amino acids. The primary sequence of this polypeptide is an alternating pattern of Leucine (a hydrophobic amino acid) and Serine (a polar, uncharged amino acid). The polypeptide is initially dissolved in a nonpolar organic solvent, where it adopts a disordered, random coil conformation. The experiment then involves completely removing the organic solvent and redissolving the polypeptide in a large volume of pure water at a neutral pH of 7.0.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of protein folding, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary conformational change the polypeptide chain will undergo immediately after being transferred into the aqueous environment?\n\nA. The polypeptide will undergo hydrophobic collapse, forming a compact structure where the hydrophobic Leucine side chains are buried in the interior and the polar Serine side chains are exposed to the water.\n\nB. The polypeptide will fold to expose the hydrophobic Leucine side chains to water to maximize interactions with the solvent, while burying the polar Serine side chains in the core.\n\nC. The polypeptide will remain in an extended, random coil conformation to maximize the hydrogen bonding between its polar peptide backbone and the surrounding water molecules.\n\nD. The polypeptide will rapidly denature and precipitate, as the polar water molecules will cause the hydrolysis and breaking of the covalent peptide bonds.\n\nE. The polypeptide will primarily form a stable alpha-helix, driven by electrostatic repulsion between the hydrophobic Leucine side chains.", "solution": "We are asked to predict the primary conformational change for a 12-residue peptide with an alternating Leucine (hydrophobic) and Serine (polar, uncharged) sequence when transferred from a nonpolar solvent, where it is a random coil, into water at neutral pH.\n\nFundamental principle: aqueous folding is governed by minimization of the Gibbs free energy,\n$$\n\\Delta G=\\Delta H - T \\Delta S,\n$$\nwith key contributions from solvation, conformational entropy, and intramolecular interactions. The dominant immediate driving force upon exposure to water for sequences containing hydrophobic side chains is the hydrophobic effect: burying nonpolar surface area reduces the ordering of surrounding water, thereby increasing solvent entropy. Writing the free-energy change as a sum of contributions,\n$$\n\\Delta G \\approx \\Delta G_{\\text{solv}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{int}},\n$$\nthe solvation term can be qualitatively approximated as\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{solv}} \\approx \\gamma \\,\\Delta A_{\\text{hyd}} - \\gamma' \\,\\Delta A_{\\text{polar}},\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma>0$ penalizes exposed hydrophobic solvent-accessible surface area and $\\gamma'>0$ reflects the favorable exposure of polar area. Thus, reducing exposed hydrophobic area $A_{\\text{hyd}}$ (by burying Leucine side chains) decreases $\\Delta G$, while exposing polar area $A_{\\text{polar}}$ (by presenting Serine side chains to solvent) further decreases $\\Delta G$.\n\nThe conformational entropy loss upon collapse, $\\Delta S_{\\text{conf}}<0$, gives a penalty $-T\\Delta S_{\\text{conf}}>0$, but the hydrophobic effect is known to drive an initial, rapid collapse on short timescales. Therefore, the net immediate conformational change is a hydrophobic collapse to a compact ensemble with hydrophobic Leucine side chains sequestered from water and polar Serine side chains solvent-exposed.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n\n- A predicts hydrophobic collapse with Leucine buried and Serine exposed. This matches the thermodynamic arguments above and the known rapid timescale of hydrophobic collapse.\n- B proposes exposing hydrophobic Leucine side chains to water and burying Serine, which increases $A_{\\text{hyd}}$ and raises $\\Delta G$, contrary to the hydrophobic effect, so it is incorrect.\n- C proposes remaining an extended random coil to maximize backbone hydrogen bonding with water. While backbone-water hydrogen bonding is favorable, leaving hydrophobics fully exposed is unfavorable; the primary immediate response is collapse to reduce hydrophobic exposure, not remaining extended.\n- D proposes rapid denaturation and peptide-bond hydrolysis at neutral pH. Peptide bonds are kinetically stable at pH 7; hydrolysis is negligibly slow, so this is incorrect.\n- E proposes a stable alpha-helix driven by electrostatic repulsion between hydrophobic Leucine side chains. Alpha-helix formation is driven by backbone hydrogen bonding and side-chain compatibility, not by electrostatic repulsion among hydrophobics. Moreover, the immediate, general effect is collapse, not guaranteed helix formation for this alternating sequence.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction of the primary conformational change immediately upon transfer into water is hydrophobic collapse with buried Leucine and exposed Serine, as in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2310254"}, {"introduction": "While the hydrophobic effect drives the overall collapse of a polypeptide, the specific local structures, like $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, are determined by the intrinsic properties of the amino acids in the sequence. This exercise [@problem_id:2310291] focuses on the stability of an $\\alpha$-helix, a cornerstone of protein architecture. You will analyze the consequences of replacing a proline residue—a known 'helix breaker'—with alanine, an amino acid with a high propensity to form helices, providing a clear illustration of how primary sequence dictates secondary structure.", "problem": "In the study of a rare congenital condition affecting cytoskeletal integrity, researchers have identified a point mutation in the gene encoding a structural protein known as \"Flexilin\". The wild-type Flexilin protein contains a long alpha-helical domain that is critical for its function. The mutation leads to the substitution of a single amino acid at a position located in the middle of this alpha-helix. Specifically, a proline residue is replaced by an alanine residue.\n\nBased on the distinct biochemical properties of these two amino acids, what is the most probable direct consequence of this substitution for the secondary structure of the Flexilin protein?\n\nA. The alpha-helix will become more stable and structurally regular.\n\nB. The alpha-helix will be completely disrupted and transition into a beta-pleated sheet.\n\nC. The substitution will introduce a sharp, rigid bend, making the alpha-helix less stable.\n\nD. The substitution will have no significant effect on the helix structure because both proline and alanine are small, nonpolar amino acids.\n\nE. The substitution will promote the formation of an inappropriate disulfide bond, distorting the helix.", "solution": "- Identify the key biochemical difference: Proline has a cyclic side chain that covalently bonds to the backbone nitrogen, making it a secondary amine. This eliminates the backbone N–H, which is required for the intrahelical hydrogen bond pattern in an alpha-helix (the $i$ to $i+4$ hydrogen bond). Proline also strongly restricts the backbone $\\phi$ angle, introducing a rigid kink and acting as a classic helix breaker when present in the middle of an alpha-helix.\n- Contrast with alanine: Alanine is small, nonpolar, and has one of the highest helix propensities among amino acids. It provides a backbone N–H capable of participating in the $i$ to $i+4$ hydrogen bonding network and does not impose unusual conformational constraints on the backbone.\n- Consequence of substituting proline with alanine in the middle of an alpha-helix: The substitution removes a helix-disrupting residue (proline) and replaces it with a helix-stabilizing residue (alanine), thereby restoring the continuous hydrogen-bond network and regular helical geometry. This directly increases helix stability and regularity.\n- Evaluate distractors: \n  - B is incorrect because a single residue substitution in an established helical region does not directly convert it to a beta-pleated sheet. \n  - C describes the effect of introducing proline, not replacing it with alanine. \n  - D is incorrect because proline’s cyclic structure and absence of backbone N–H make it fundamentally different from alanine despite both being nonpolar. \n  - E is incorrect because disulfide bonds involve cysteine residues, not alanine or proline.\n\nTherefore, the most probable direct consequence is increased stability and structural regularity of the alpha-helix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2310291"}, {"introduction": "The principles governing the folding of a single polypeptide chain also extend to the assembly of multiple chains into functional complexes, known as quaternary structure.

This case study challenges you to apply your understanding of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions to predict the effect on protein assembly and, ultimately, its biological activity.", "problem": "A hypothetical enzyme, Catalase-Associated Dimer (CAD), functions optimally only when two identical polypeptide subunits assemble into a homodimer. The interface where the two subunits connect is a predominantly nonpolar, hydrophobic patch. A critical interaction at the center of this interface involves a leucine residue from each subunit fitting into a hydrophobic pocket on the opposing subunit. Genetic engineering is used to create a mutant version of CAD where this specific leucine residue on both subunits is replaced with an aspartate residue. The rest of the protein sequence remains unchanged. The mutant protein is then placed in a buffered aqueous solution at a physiological pH of 7.4.\n\nBased on the principles of protein structure and amino acid chemistry, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of this mutation?\n\nA. The mutation will disrupt the hydrophobic interactions necessary for dimerization, leading to a predominance of non-functional monomers and a loss of enzyme activity.\n\nB.

The two aspartate residues will be oxidized to form a covalent bond, permanently linking the two subunits and leading to a loss of the flexibility required for function.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of a specific mutation on the structure and function of a dimeric protein. The mutation involves replacing a hydrophobic amino acid (leucine) with a negatively charged amino acid (aspartate) at the dimer interface.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** The wild-type protein is a functional homodimer. The two subunits are held together by interactions at a \"predominantly nonpolar, hydrophobic patch.\" The specific interaction mentioned is a leucine residue from each subunit nestling into a hydrophobic pocket on the other. This describes an interaction driven by the hydrophobic effect. In an aqueous environment, nonpolar groups cluster together to minimize their disruptive contact with water molecules, releasing ordered water and increasing the overall entropy of the system. This is a major driving force for protein folding and association.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mutation:** A leucine (Leu) is replaced by an aspartate (Asp).\n    *   **Leucine's side chain:** `-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. This is an alkyl group, which is nonpolar and hydrophobic.\n    *   **Aspartate's side chain:** `-CH2-COO-`. At a physiological pH of 7.4, which is well above the pKa of its carboxylic acid group (around 3.9), this side chain will be deprotonated and carry a full negative charge (`-CH2-COO-`). It is therefore highly polar and hydrophilic.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the consequences of the mutation on the dimer interface:**\n    *   The original stabilizing force was the hydrophobic effect, which involved burying the nonpolar leucine side chains at the interface, away from the surrounding water.\n    *   The mutation replaces these hydrophobic side chains with negatively charged, hydrophilic aspartate side chains.\n    *   Placing a charged group like aspartate into a hydrophobic environment is thermodynamically very unfavorable. The aspartate side chain would much rather be exposed to the aqueous solvent where it can be stabilized by hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions with water molecules.\n    *   Furthermore, when two mutant subunits approach each other, the two negatively charged aspartate residues at the interface will experience electrostatic repulsion. This repulsion directly opposes the association of the subunits.\n    *   Therefore, the mutation fundamentally undermines the primary force holding the dimer together (the hydrophobic effect) and introduces a new, strong repulsive force (electrostatic repulsion). The equilibrium will shift dramatically away from the dimer and towards the dissociated monomers.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the consequences for protein function:** The problem states that the enzyme \"functions optimally only when\" it is a dimer. If the mutation prevents dimerization, the protein will exist predominantly as monomers. These monomers, according to the problem description, are not functional (or at least not optimally functional). Thus, the mutation will lead to a loss of enzyme activity.\n\n5.  **Assess the given options:**\n    *   **A. The mutation will disrupt the hydrophobic interactions necessary for dimerization, leading to a predominance of non-functional monomers and a loss of enzyme activity.** This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The hydrophobic interactions are disrupted, the dimer is destabilized, and since function depends on the dimeric form, activity is lost. This is the most likely outcome.\n    *   **B. The two new aspartate residues will form a strong salt bridge, stabilizing the dimer into a hyper-stable, rigid structure that enhances its catalytic activity.** This is incorrect. A salt bridge is an ionic bond between a positively charged residue and a negatively charged residue (e.g., between aspartate and lysine). An interaction between two identical negative charges (Asp-Asp) would be repulsive, not attractive.\n    *   **C. The mutation will have a negligible effect on the quaternary structure, but it will directly alter the shape of the active site on each monomer, rendering the enzyme inactive.** This is unlikely. A mutation at the dimer interface is most likely to affect dimerization itself (the quaternary structure). While it's possible the active site is nearby, the primary and most direct effect is on the stability of the dimer. The loss of function is a consequence of the loss of quaternary structure, not a separate, direct effect on the active site within the monomer.\n    *   **D. The replacement of a nonpolar residue with a charged one will cause the individual subunits to completely unfold their tertiary structure.** This is an overstatement. A single amino acid substitution, particularly on the surface of a folded domain (even if it's at an interface), is unlikely to cause the *complete* unfolding of the entire tertiary structure. The core of the monomer would likely remain folded. The primary effect is on the interaction *between* subunits, not the stability *within* a subunit.\n    *   **E. The two aspartate residues will be oxidized to form a covalent bond, permanently linking the two subunits and leading to a loss of the flexibility required for function.** This is chemically incorrect. Aspartate cannot be oxidized to form a covalent bond with another aspartate. The formation of covalent disulfide bonds involves the oxidation of the thiol groups of two cysteine residues.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, option A is the only one that correctly describes the physicochemical consequences of the Leu -> Asp mutation at a hydrophobic protein-protein interface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2310258"}]}
