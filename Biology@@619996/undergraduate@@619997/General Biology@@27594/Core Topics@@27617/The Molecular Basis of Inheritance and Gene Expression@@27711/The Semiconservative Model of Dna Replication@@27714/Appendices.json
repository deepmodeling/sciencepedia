This \"heavy\" plasmid is then introduced into a bacterial culture growing in a medium that contains only the light isotope of nitrogen, ${}^{14}\\text{N}$, as the sole nitrogen source for all metabolic processes, including the synthesis of new DNA. The growth medium is also supplemented with a specific chemical inhibitor that completely blocks the function of the enzyme DNA ligase. The bacteria are cultured under these conditions for a duration that allows for precisely one full round of plasmid replication to complete.\n\nFollowing this single replication cycle, the entire population of plasmids is isolated from the bacterial cells. The purified plasmid DNA is then treated with a denaturing agent that completely separates all double-stranded DNA into single strands.

Start with a circular, double-stranded plasmid in which both strands are uniformly labeled with ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ (heavy).\n2. Shift to medium containing only ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ and a DNA ligase inhibitor; allow exactly one round of replication to complete.\n3. By semiconservative replication, each daughter duplex contains one original ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ parental strand (continuous, high molecular weight) and one newly synthesized ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ strand.\n4. With ligase inhibited:\n   - Lagging strands remain as multiple unligated Okazaki fragments, each bounded by nicks, though base-paired to the template in the duplex state.\n   - Leading strands are synthesized continuously but retain at least one nick where primer replacement cannot be sealed; functionally, after denaturation this yields one very long single-stranded fragment (nearly full plasmid length) plus a very short fragment.\n5. After isolation, denaturation separates all duplexes into single strands:\n   - The parental ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ strands remain intact, single-stranded, high-molecular-weight molecules.\n   - The nascent ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ lagging strands dissociate into many short single-stranded Okazaki fragments of a range of sizes.\n   - The nascent ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ leading strands contribute one near–full-length single-stranded fragment (co-migrating with high molecular weight) and one very small fragment (co-migrating with the small-fragment smear).\n6. In agarose electrophoresis, mobility is governed by length; isotope labeling (${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ versus ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$) does not produce distinct bands by mass in agarose. Therefore:\n   - All near–full-length single strands (parental heavy strands and near–full-length leading-strand fragments) form a single, slow-migrating, high-molecular-weight band near the top.\n   - The numerous short Okazaki fragments (and tiny leading-strand patch fragments) form a faster-migrating, broad, low-molecular-weight band or smear.\n\nConclusion:\nThis pattern is best described by the presence of one high-molecular-weight band near the top and a separate, faster, broad smear of small fragments, matching option C. Options invoking isotope-based separation in agarose (B) or absence of small fragments (D) are inconsistent with ligase inhibition and agarose electrophoresis properties; a single intermediate band (A) or an entire-lane smear (E) also do not match the defined fragment population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2323786"}, {"introduction": "In living cells, DNA replication is intimately linked with the systems that maintain genome integrity, such as mutation detection and repair. This advanced problem presents a thought-provoking scenario where a replication error interacts with a malfunctioning mismatch repair system, leading to a permanent mutation [@problem_id:2323759].

Replication of the other parental strand proceeds without error.\n\nFollowing this replication event, the cell's Mismatch Repair (MMR) system detects the C-T mismatch. However, the repair mechanism fails to correctly identify the newly synthesized strand and instead makes a critical mistake: it treats the parental (${}^{15}\\text{N}-containing) strand as the one with the error. The system excises the cytosine (C) from the parental strand and replaces it with an adenine (A), creating a stable A-T base pair.
