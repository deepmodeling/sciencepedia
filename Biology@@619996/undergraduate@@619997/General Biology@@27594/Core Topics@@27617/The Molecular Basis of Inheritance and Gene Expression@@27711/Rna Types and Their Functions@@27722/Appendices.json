Trp-Leu-Asp", "solution": "The fundamental process described is the translation of a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence into a polypeptide chain of amino acids. The process follows a specific set of rules encoded in the genetic code.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reading Frame**\nTranslation begins at a specific start codon and proceeds in a 5' to 3' direction along the mRNA molecule. The universally recognized start codon is AUG, which also codes for the amino acid Methionine. The given mRNA sequence is 5'-AUGGCUAGAUAA-3'. We scan from the 5' end and find the start codon AUG at the very beginning. This establishes the reading frame for the rest of the sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Group the Sequence into Codons**\nStarting with the AUG codon, we group the rest of the nucleotide sequence into non-overlapping groups of three bases.\nThe sequence is 5'-AUG GCU AGA UAA-3'.\n- The first codon is AUG.\n- The second codon is GCU.\n- The third codon is AGA.\n- The fourth codon is UAA.\n\n**Step 3: Translate Each Codon into an Amino Acid**\nWe use the provided genetic code table to translate each codon sequentially.\n\n- **Codon 1: AUG**\n  Looking at the table under \"First base A\", we find that AUG codes for Methionine (Met). It also serves as the START signal. So, the polypeptide begins with Met.\n\n- **Codon 2: GCU**\n  Looking at the table under \"First base G\", we find that GCU is one of the codons for Alanine (Ala).\n\n- **Codon 3: AGA**\n  Looking at the table under \"First base A\" (or \"First base C\" since Arginine has codons in both), we find that AGA codes for Arginine (Arg).\n\n- **Codon 4: UAA**\n  Looking at the table under \"First base U\", we find that UAA is a STOP codon.\n\n**Step 4: Terminate Translation**\nWhen the ribosome encounters a STOP codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA), translation is terminated. The STOP codon itself does not code for an amino acid; it signals the release of the newly synthesized polypeptide chain. Therefore, the sequence of amino acids ends with the amino acid coded by the codon immediately preceding the stop codon.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final Polypeptide Sequence**\nCombining the translated amino acids in order, we get:\nMethionine (Met) - Alanine (Ala) - Arginine (Arg)\n\nThe full polypeptide sequence is Met-Ala-Arg.\n\n**Step 6: Compare with Multiple-Choice Options**\n- A. Met-Ala-Arg: This matches our derived sequence.\n- B. Met-Ala-Arg-Stop: Incorrect. The stop codon terminates translation but is not incorporated as an amino acid.\n- C. Asn-Arg-Ser-Val: Incorrect. This sequence would result from reading the mRNA in the reverse 3' to 5' direction (3'-AAUAGAUGCGGA-5'), which is not how translation occurs. The codons would be AAU (Asn), AGA (Arg), UCG (Ser), GUA (Val).\n- D. Met-Gly-Arg: Incorrect. This would imply the second codon was for Glycine (e.g., GGU), not Alanine (GCU).\n- E. Trp-Leu-Asp: Incorrect. This is the result of a frameshift error, starting the reading frame one nucleotide late (from the 'G' in AUG). The codons would be UGG (Trp), CUA (Leu), GAU (Asp).\n\nTherefore, the correct amino acid sequence is Met-Ala-Arg.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2313712"}, {"introduction": "While translation is a highly accurate process, errors can occur in the genetic message, such as mutations that create a premature stop codon.

[@problem_id:2313718]", "problem": "In a laboratory study of gene expression, a researcher identifies a point mutation within the coding sequence of a specific gene. This mutation results in the alteration of a single nucleotide in the DNA, which, after transcription, changes a codon in the resulting messenger RNA (mRNA) from 5'-CAG-3' to 5'-UAG-3'. This mRNA molecule is then translated by a ribosome.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate molecular event that occurs when the ribosome encounters the 5'-UAG-3' codon in its A-site, leading to the termination of protein synthesis?\n\nA. A transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule with an anticodon complementary to UAG binds to the A-site. This tRNA does not carry an amino acid, which serves as a signal for the ribosome to dissociate.\nB. Translation stalls at the UAG codon because no tRNA in the cell has a complementary anticodon, causing the ribosome to wait for an extended period before passively dissociating from the mRNA.\nC. A protein known as a release factor binds to the A-site. This binding triggers the hydrolysis of the bond connecting the nascent polypeptide chain to the tRNA molecule located in the P-site of the ribosome.\nD. The UAG codon is recognized by a special \"terminator tRNA\" that carries and adds a blocking chemical group to the end of the polypeptide chain, preventing further elongation.\nE. The ribosome recognizes UAG as non-coding and skips over it, resuming translation at the next in-frame codon, which results in a protein that is missing a single amino acid.", "solution": "The problem describes a nonsense mutation, where a codon that specifies an amino acid is changed into a stop codon. Here, the original codon 5'-CAG-3' codes for the amino acid glutamine. The mutation changes it to 5'-UAG-3'.\n\n1.  **Identify the nature of the new codon:** The genetic code has specific signals to start and stop translation. The codon 5'-UAG-3' is one of the three canonical stop codons (the other two being 5'-UAA-3' and 5'-UGA-3'). These codons do not code for any amino acid in the standard genetic code. Their function is to signal the termination of the translation process.\n\n2.  **Analyze the process of translation at a stop codon:** During the elongation phase of translation, the ribosome moves along the mRNA, reading codons one by one. For each sense codon, a specific transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule with a complementary anticodon carrying the corresponding amino acid binds to the A-site (aminoacyl site) of the ribosome.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the role of tRNA:** There are no standard tRNA molecules in the cell that have anticodons capable of recognizing stop codons and carrying an amino acid. Therefore, when a stop codon like UAG enters the A-site, translation elongation cannot proceed in the usual manner.\n\n4.  **Introduce Release Factors (RFs):** The cellular machinery recognizes stop codons using specific proteins called release factors (RFs). These proteins have a three-dimensional structure that mimics the shape of a tRNA molecule.\n\n5.  **Describe the mechanism of termination:** When the ribosome's A-site is occupied by a stop codon (UAG in this case), a release factor binds to the A-site instead of a tRNA. This binding event initiates the termination sequence.\n\n6.  **Catalysis of Polypeptide Release:** The binding of the release factor induces a conformational change in the ribosome. This change activates the peptidyl transferase center of the large ribosomal subunit, but instead of forming a new peptide bond, it catalyzes the hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the C-terminus of the newly synthesized polypeptide chain to the tRNA molecule residing in the P-site (peptidyl site).\n\n7.  **Dissociation of the complex:** Following the cleavage and release of the completed (or in this case, truncated) polypeptide, the entire translational complex dissociates. The ribosomal subunits separate from each other, and the mRNA and the now-uncharged tRNA in the P-site are released.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   **A is incorrect.** Standard tRNAs do not recognize stop codons. The idea of a special, uncharged tRNA for termination is a common misconception.\n    *   **B is incorrect.** Termination is not a passive process of waiting and eventual dissociation. It is an active,-factor-mediated process.\n    *   **C is correct.** This statement accurately describes the key events: a protein release factor binds to the A-site, and this binding directly leads to the hydrolysis and release of the polypeptide chain from the P-site tRNA.\n    *   **D is incorrect.** This describes a hypothetical \"terminator tRNA\" that adds a chemical group. This is not how translation termination occurs. Release factors are proteins, not tRNAs, and they cause hydrolysis, not addition.\n    *   **E is incorrect.** Skipping a codon is a phenomenon known as ribosomal bypassing, which is rare and not the standard outcome of encountering a stop codon. The ribosome terminates, it does not skip.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the immediate molecular event is the binding of a release factor to the A-site, which triggers the release of the polypeptide chain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2313718"}, {"introduction": "The information content of an an mRNA molecule is not always a direct, unaltered copy of the DNA from which it was transcribed.

They focus on the GluA2 subunit, which forms a part of the channel's central pore. Analysis of the genomic Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) reveals that the codon on the coding strand for a key amino acid in this pore region is `CAG`. However, when mature Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) is isolated from adult brain cells and sequenced, the corresponding codon is found to be `CIG`, where `I` denotes the non-standard nucleotide inosine.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume the following:\n1.  During translation, the cell's ribosomal machinery interprets the base inosine (I) as if it were guanosine (G).\n2.  The ion channel pore is the narrowest part of the channel, and the chemical properties of the amino acids lining it determine which ions can pass through. The primary ions that move through AMPA receptors are positively charged, such as sodium ($Na^{+}$) and calcium ($Ca^{2+}$).\n3.  A partial genetic code table is provided below, listing mRNA codons and the amino acids they specify:\n    -   `CAG`: Glutamine (Gln), a neutral, polar amino acid.\n    -   `CAA`: Glutamine (Gln)\n    -   `CGG`: Arginine (Arg), a positively charged, polar amino acid.\n    -   `CGA`: Arginine (Arg)\n    -   `UAG`: Stop codon\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements describes the most likely functional consequence of this change from the genomic blueprint to the mature mRNA transcript?\n\nA. The modification results in a silent mutation, leading to no change in the receptor's primary structure or function.\nB. The modification introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated and likely non-functional receptor protein.\nC. The modification substitutes a neutral amino acid with a positively charged one in the channel pore, which is expected to decrease the channel's permeability to positively charged ions like $Ca^{2+}$.\nD. The modification substitutes a neutral amino acid with a negatively charged one, which is expected to increase the channel's permeability to positively charged ions like $Ca^{2+}$.\nE. The modification substitutes a neutral amino acid with a positively charged one, which is expected to attract and thereby increase the channel's permeability to positively charged ions like $Na^{+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$.", "solution": "We begin by relating the coding DNA strand to the mRNA sequence. For a given codon on the coding strand, the transcribed mRNA codon has the same 5' to 3' sequence with thymine replaced by uracil. Therefore, a coding-strand codon $CAG$ would ordinarily yield mRNA $CAG$, which the provided genetic code indicates specifies glutamine (Gln), a neutral, polar amino acid.\n\nThe isolated mature mRNA instead contains the codon $CIG$, where $I$ denotes inosine. By the given assumption, during translation inosine is interpreted as if it were guanosine. Hence, the ribosome effectively reads $CIG$ as $CGG$.\n\nUsing the provided genetic code table, $CGG$ specifies arginine (Arg), a positively charged, polar amino acid. Thus, the RNA editing event has converted the encoded amino acid from glutamine (neutral, polar) to arginine (positively charged, polar). This is not a silent change, and it does not introduce a stop codon, since $CIG$ read as $CGG$ is not $UAG$.\n\nNext, we consider the functional effect in the channel pore. The pore’s ion selectivity and permeability depend on the chemical properties of the lining residues. Introducing a positively charged side chain (arginine) in the pore increases positive electrostatic potential in that region. By electrostatic principles (like charges repel), positively charged ions such as $Na^{+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$ experience electrostatic repulsion in a positively charged environment. Therefore, replacing a neutral residue (glutamine) with a positively charged residue (arginine) in the pore is expected to decrease permeability to positively charged ions, particularly $Ca^{2+}$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is false because the substitution changes the amino acid (not silent).\n- B is false because no stop codon is created ($CIG \\rightarrow CGG$, not $UAG$).\n- C is true: neutral to positively charged substitution in the pore should decrease cation permeability such as $Ca^{2+}$.\n- D is false because the substitution is not to a negatively charged residue.\n- E is false because a positively charged pore would not attract but rather repel cations, decreasing their permeability.\n\nTherefore, the most likely functional consequence is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2313702"}]}
