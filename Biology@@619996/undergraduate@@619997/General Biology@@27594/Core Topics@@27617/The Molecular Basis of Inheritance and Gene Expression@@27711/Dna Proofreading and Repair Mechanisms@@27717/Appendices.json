This exercise moves from the *rate* of mutation to the *type* of mutation, introducing the concept of distinct \"mutational signatures.\" By comparing the genetic consequences of a proofreading defect versus an MMR defect, you will learn to connect a specific molecular failure to the characteristic pattern of mutations it leaves behind in the genome [@problem_id:2080934].", "problem": "A molecular biology researcher is studying two mutant mammalian cell lines, designated Cell Line X and Cell Line Y, both of which exhibit a \"mutator\" phenotype, meaning they accumulate mutations at a rate significantly higher than wild-type cells.\n\n- **Cell Line X** has a specific mutation in the gene encoding its primary replicative Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) polymerase, rendering the polymerase's intrinsic 3' to 5' exonuclease (proofreading) activity completely non-functional.\n- **Cell Line Y** has a null mutation in the gene for the MutS protein, a critical recognition component of the post-replicative Mismatch Repair (MMR) system.\n\nAfter culturing both cell lines for many generations, the researcher performs whole-genome sequencing and characterizes the accumulated mutations. Two distinct mutation signatures are observed:\n\n- **Profile 1:** A high frequency of single-base substitution mutations (both transitions and transversions) distributed throughout the genome. The rate of small insertion/deletion mutations is only marginally increased compared to wild-type cells.\n- **Profile 2:** A very dramatic increase in the frequency of small (1-4 base pair) insertion/deletion mutations, which are predominantly located within short tandem repeat sequences known as microsatellites.

Loss of this activity increases the persistence of base mispairs at the time of synthesis, leading predominantly to single-base substitutions (both transitions and transversions) distributed genome-wide. Because proofreading primarily addresses base misincorporation at the primer terminus rather than correcting looped-out intermediates from strand slippage, its loss is expected to cause only a marginal increase in small insertion/deletion mutations.\n\nBy contrast, the post-replicative mismatch repair system, initiated by MutS recognition, corrects two main classes of replication errors: base-base mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops, especially those arising from polymerase slippage within short tandem repeats (microsatellites). A null mutation in MutS abolishes recognition and repair of these errors, producing microsatellite instability characterized by a dramatic increase in 1â€“4 base pair insertion/deletion mutations concentrated in repetitive tracts, along with a moderate increase in single-base substitutions.\n\nComparing these mechanistic expectations to the observed profiles:\n- Profile 1 shows a high frequency of single-base substitutions with only a marginal increase in small indels, which aligns with the predicted outcome of losing polymerase proofreading.\n- Profile 2 shows a very dramatic increase in small indels within microsatellites and a moderate increase in substitutions, which aligns with the predicted outcome of losing MutS-dependent mismatch repair.\n\nTherefore, Cell Line X (loss of proofreading) corresponds to Profile 1, and Cell Line Y (loss of MutS/MMR) corresponds to Profile 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2080934"}, {"introduction": "To fully grasp the importance of DNA repair, it is essential to see how molecular errors scale up to affect entire populations over time.
