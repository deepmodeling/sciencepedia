Construct the mutated sequence by deleting the fifth base:\n- Original positions: 1 A, 2 U, 3 G, 4 U, 5 G (deleted), 6 G, 7 A, 8 C, 9 U, 10 U, 11 C, 12 A, 13 C, 14 G, 15 A, 16 U, 17 A, 18 A\n- Mutated sequence: 5'-AUGUGACUUCACGAUAA-3'\n\nRe-establish the reading frame from the start codon AUG:\n- Mutated codons: AUG | UGA | CUU | CAC | GAU | AA...\nHere, the second codon is UGA, which is a stop codon. Therefore, translation initiates at AUG (Met) and terminates immediately at UGA, producing a polypeptide consisting of only the first amino acid, Methionine.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A is false because translation does not correct frameshift mutations.\n- B is true: the polypeptide is truncated to a single Methionine due to an immediate premature stop codon.\n- C is false: the mutation causes a frameshift, not just deletion of Tryptophan.\n- D is false: the chain is not longer; it is much shorter.\n- E is false: the first amino acid remains Methionine because the AUG start codon is unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the resulting polypeptide is significantly shorter, consisting of only Methionine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2317943"}, {"introduction": "Cells must dynamically control gene expression to adapt to their environment, rather than producing all proteins constantly.

The `Regulin` gene contains a specific internal exon that, if included in the final messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript, introduces a premature termination codon. Such transcripts containing this \"poison exon\" are rapidly identified and degraded by the cell's Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway. Transcripts where the poison exon is successfully spliced out are considered functional and are translated to produce the Regulin protein.\n\nThe Regulin protein itself functions as a splicing factor. It binds to its own pre-mRNA and represses the splicing-out of the poison exon, thereby promoting the exon's inclusion. This creates a negative feedback loop where higher concentrations of Regulin protein lead to a lower fraction of functional mRNA being produced.\n\nThe steady-state dynamics of this system can be modeled by the following relationships:\n1. The steady-state concentration of functional mRNA, $[M_f]$, is determined by its production rate (dependent on the transcription rate $k_{tx}$ and splicing efficiency $s$) and its degradation rate ($d_f$):\n$$[M_f] = \\frac{k_{tx}}{d_f} s([P])$$\nwhere $[P]$ is the concentration of Regulin protein.\n2.
