The ribosome reads messenger RNA (mRNA) as a series of non-overlapping triplets, and any disruption to this frame can have drastic consequences. This first exercise explores the profound impact of a frameshift mutation, challenging you to predict the outcome when the reading frame is altered at the very beginning of a coding sequence.

In the cell's cytoplasm, a ribosome translates this mRNA into a short polypeptide. Translation begins at the start codon `AUG`, proceeds by reading the sequence in non-overlapping triplets (codons), and terminates when a stop codon is encountered.\n\nNow, consider a specific mutation where a single guanine (G) nucleotide is inserted into the mRNA sequence immediately after the start codon `AUG`.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the consequence for the protein synthesized from this mutated mRNA compared to the protein synthesized from the original, unmutated mRNA?\n\nA. The protein will be identical to the original because the mutation occurs after the start codon, and the genetic code is redundant.\n\nB. Only the second amino acid in the protein will be altered, with the rest of the protein's sequence remaining identical to the original.\n\nC. The amino acid sequence will be completely altered after the first amino acid, likely resulting in a truncated and non-functional protein.\n\nD. No protein will be produced because the ribosome cannot initiate translation on the mutated messenger RNA (mRNA).\n\nE. The resulting protein will be one amino acid longer than the original, but the sequence of the original amino acids will be preserved within the new protein.", "solution": "Identify the original reading frame and translation. The mRNA is 5'-AUG GCA UCU GAG UAA-3'. The ribosome initiates at AUG, then reads non-overlapping triplets:\n- AUG codes methionine (start).\n- GCA codes alanine.\n- UCU codes serine.\n- GAG codes glutamate.\n- UAA is a stop codon.\nThus, the original polypeptide is Met-Ala-Ser-Glu, then termination.\n\nApply the specified mutation: insert a single G immediately after the start codon AUG. The sequence after AUG originally begins with GCA; inserting G just after AUG yields 5'-AUG G GCA UCU GAG UAA-3'. Removing spaces for reading frame clarity, the sequence becomes AUGGGCAUCUGAGUAA.\n\nRe-establish the reading frame from the same AUG start and parse into codons post-insertion:\n- First codon: AUG (positions 1–3) codes methionine.\n- Second codon: GGC (positions 4–6; composed of the inserted G plus the first two bases of the original GCA) codes glycine.\n- Third codon: AUC (positions 7–9) codes isoleucine.\n- Fourth codon: UGA (positions 10–12) is a stop codon.\n\nConclude the consequence. The single-nucleotide insertion causes a frameshift immediately after the first codon, altering every codon downstream of AUG relative to the original frame and introducing a premature stop (UGA). Therefore, the amino acid sequence is completely altered after the first amino acid, and the protein is truncated relative to the original, with high likelihood of loss of function.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A is incorrect: redundancy of the genetic code does not compensate for a frameshift; insertion changes the reading frame.\n- B is incorrect: the frameshift alters all subsequent codons, not only the second amino acid.\n- C is correct: frameshift after the first amino acid alters the sequence and introduces a premature stop, truncating the protein.\n- D is incorrect: initiation at AUG still occurs.\n- E is incorrect: the protein is not simply one amino acid longer; it is altered and, in this case, shorter due to an early stop.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2322737"}, {"introduction": "The ribosome is a dynamic molecular machine that moves along the mRNA in a step-by-step cycle. Each step is driven by specific protein \"elongation factors\" that ensure the process is both rapid and accurate. This practice problem uses a hypothetical inhibitor to freeze the ribosome at a single, critical moment in the elongation cycle, challenging you to deduce the precise state of the complex when the translocation step is blocked. [@problem_id:2322751]", "problem": "An in-vitro translation system is prepared using components isolated from a eukaryotic cell line. This system contains functional ribosomes, a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript, all 20 types of amino acids, and a complete set of charged transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. Additionally, it includes all necessary protein factors for initiation, elongation, and termination, along with a sufficient supply of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nA researcher introduces a highly specific inhibitor called \"Stallimycin\" into this system before initiating translation. Stallimycin is known to bind exclusively to eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2 (eEF-2), the protein responsible for catalyzing the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA, rendering eEF-2 non-functional.\n\nThe experiment begins, and translation initiates correctly. The ribosome assembles at the start codon, and the first peptide bond successfully forms between the initial methionine (in the P-site) and the second amino acid (brought by a tRNA to the A-site).\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the state of the ribosomal complex immediately following the formation of this first peptide bond?\n\nA. The ribosome will be stalled with a dipeptidyl-tRNA in the A-site and an uncharged tRNA in the P-site.\n\nB.

The peptidyl transferase center will be inhibited, preventing the formation of any further peptide bonds.\n\nE. The uncharged tRNA will be in the E-site, poised for release from the ribosome.", "solution": "Fundamental elongation steps in eukaryotic translation are as follows: (i) delivery of an aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site by eEF-1A with GTP hydrolysis, (ii) peptidyl transfer catalyzed by the large subunit rRNA (peptidyl transferase activity), transferring the nascent peptide from the P-site tRNA to the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A-site, and (iii) translocation of the ribosome by one codon mediated by eEF-2 with GTP hydrolysis, which moves the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site, the deacylated tRNA from the P-site to the E-site, and opens the A-site for the next aminoacyl-tRNA.\n\nIn the described system, initiation proceeds normally, placing Met-tRNA in the P-site and allowing an aminoacyl-tRNA to enter the A-site. The first peptide bond forms correctly, so the peptidyl transferase has transferred the peptide to the A-site tRNA. Immediately after this peptide bond formation and before translocation, the ribosomal complex is in the pre-translocation state: the A-site holds the peptidyl-tRNA (now a dipeptidyl-tRNA) and the P-site holds a deacylated (uncharged) tRNA. Translocation to move these tRNAs to the P- and E-sites, respectively, requires functional eEF-2.\n\nBecause Stallimycin specifically inhibits eEF-2, the translocation step cannot occur. Therefore, the ribosome becomes stalled in the pre-translocation state, with a dipeptidyl-tRNA remaining in the A-site and an uncharged tRNA remaining in the P-site. This directly supports option A.\n\nBy contrast: (B) premature disassembly does not occur simply from blocked translocation; termination requires a stop codon and release factors. (C) an empty A-site exposing a new codon would require successful translocation, which is blocked. (D) peptidyl transferase is not inhibited by eEF-2 inhibition and has already formed the first peptide bond.

The overall process can be broken down into four main stages: amino acid activation, initiation, elongation, and termination.\n\nConsider the synthesis of a specific polypeptide that is 247 amino acids long. The energetic costs for each stage are as follows:\n1.  **Amino Acid Activation:** Before an amino acid can be incorporated into a polypeptide, it must first be attached to its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule. This 'charging' process hydrolyzes one ATP molecule to Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi). The subsequent hydrolysis of PPi into two inorganic phosphates means that this step is energetically equivalent to the breaking of two high-energy phosphate bonds per amino acid.\n2.  **Initiation:** The formation of the complete ribosomal initiation complex on the messenger RNA (mRNA) requires the hydrolysis of one GTP molecule to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP).\n3.  **Elongation:** For each amino acid added to the growing polypeptide chain after the initial one, the elongation cycle consumes two GTP molecules. One GTP is hydrolyzed during the binding of the correct aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, and a second GTP is hydrolyzed during the translocation of the ribosome to the next codon.\n4.  **Termination:** The release of the completed polypeptide chain and dissociation of the ribosomal machinery requires the hydrolysis of one GTP molecule.\n\nAssuming the process starts with free amino acids and concludes with the release of the final 247-amino-acid polypeptide, calculate the total number of high-energy phosphate bonds (from both ATP and GTP) that are hydrolyzed.", "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of amino acids in the polypeptide.
