{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before we can study how a gene is processed, we must first determine its basic structure of exons and introns. This foundational exercise in bioinformatics challenges you to act like a computational biologist, deciphering a gene’s architecture by aligning its messenger RNA sequence (in the form of cDNA) back to its original genomic DNA sequence. Mastering this skill is essential for interpreting the vast amount of data generated by modern sequencing projects [@problem_id:2294334].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the structure of a novel gene, designated `Gene-Y`, in a eukaryotic organism. They have successfully sequenced a 10,000 base pair (bp) segment of genomic DNA (gDNA) that contains the entire gene. They have also generated a complementary DNA (cDNA) library from mature messenger RNA (mRNA) isolated from the organism's cells and have sequenced the specific cDNA corresponding to `Gene-Y`. The resulting cDNA sequence is 1,500 bp long.\n\nTo map the gene's architecture, the biologist performs a computational alignment of the 1,500 bp cDNA sequence against the 10,000 bp gDNA sequence. The alignment software reports three distinct, non-overlapping High-Scoring Segment Pairs (HSPs). An HSP represents a contiguous region of high sequence similarity between the two sequences. The coordinates of these alignments are reported as follows (positions are 1-indexed):\n\n*   **HSP 1:** cDNA positions 1 to 500 align with gDNA positions 1,201 to 1,700.\n*   **HSP 2:** cDNA positions 501 to 900 align with gDNA positions 4,501 to 4,900.\n*   **HSP 3:** cDNA positions 901 to 1,500 align with gDNA positions 8,101 to 8,700.\n\nBased exclusively on this alignment data, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and justifiable conclusion about the structure of `Gene-Y`?\n\nA. `Gene-Y` consists of two exons and three introns. The introns are located in the gDNA at positions 1,701–4,500, 4,901–8,100, and 8,701–10,000.\n\nB. `Gene-Y` consists of three exons and two introns. The introns are located in the gDNA at positions 1,701–4,500 and 4,901–8,100.\n\nC. The alignment data is inconclusive because the 5' cap and 3' poly-A tail sequences, which are critical for defining gene boundaries, are not represented in the cDNA sequence.\n\nD. The presence of three distinct HSPs indicates that three separate but related genes (a gene family) occupy the 10,000 bp genomic region, not a single gene.\n\nE. The regions of the cDNA that lie between the HSPs (i.e., around positions 500 and 900) correspond to the introns that were spliced out.", "solution": "Fundamental principles: (i) A cDNA sequence derives from mature mRNA and therefore contains only exon-derived sequence (including any untranslated regions that are retained in the mRNA) and excludes introns, which are removed by splicing. (ii) When aligning cDNA to genomic DNA, contiguous high-similarity blocks (HSPs) correspond to exons, whereas the gaps in the genomic coordinates between successive, colinear HSPs correspond to introns. (iii) If the cDNA aligns in a consistent order along the genome (increasing cDNA coordinates mapping to increasing genomic coordinates), this supports a single, multi-exon gene rather than multiple genes.\n\nApply to the given alignments: The cDNA of length 1,500 bp aligns in three non-overlapping, colinear HSPs:\n- cDNA 1–500 maps to gDNA 1,201–1,700,\n- cDNA 501–900 maps to gDNA 4,501–4,900,\n- cDNA 901–1,500 maps to gDNA 8,101–8,700.\n\nBecause cDNA lacks introns, each HSP represents an exon. Therefore, the exons are located in the gDNA at 1,201–1,700, 4,501–4,900, and 8,101–8,700. The introns must lie between these exons in the genomic sequence, specifically in the intervals 1,701–4,500 and 4,901–8,100. The regions outside these exons, namely 1–1,200 (upstream) and 8,701–10,000 (downstream) relative to the mapped exons, are not supported by the cDNA as part of the transcript and cannot be asserted to be intronic; rather, they are flanking or intergenic sequences with respect to the mapped transcript.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because it asserts three introns and misclassifies the downstream gDNA 8,701–10,000 region as an intron despite no cDNA evidence of additional exonic sequence beyond 8,700; the data support only two introns between the three mapped exons.\n- B is correct: three exons (the three HSPs) and two introns located at 1,701–4,500 and 4,901–8,100.\n- C is incorrect: identifying exon–intron structure from cDNA-to-genome alignment does not require explicit five-prime cap or three-prime poly-A tail sequences; the exon count and intron intervals between mapped exons are inferable from the alignment alone.\n- D is incorrect: the single cDNA mapping colinearly to three genomic blocks indicates one spliced gene rather than three separate genes.\n- E is incorrect: introns are absent from cDNA; thus, regions “between HSPs” in the cDNA are simply exon junctions within the cDNA, not introns. The introns correspond to the gaps in the genomic coordinates between HSPs.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that Gene-Y consists of three exons and two introns located at 1,701–4,500 and 4,901–8,100 in the gDNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294334"}, {"introduction": "A single gene can create multiple protein variants through alternative splicing, a key source of biological complexity. This practice problem moves from static gene structure to the dynamics of RNA processing by asking you to quantify the total number of splicing reactions required to produce a specific mix of protein isoforms. By tracking each cut-and-paste event, you will develop a more tangible appreciation for the scale and efficiency of the splicing machinery in the cell [@problem_id:2294350].", "problem": "In a specific eukaryotic cell line, a hypothetical gene known as *Regulin* is actively transcribed. The primary transcript of the *Regulin* gene is composed of a sequence containing 7 exons separated by 6 introns. Through the process of alternative splicing, two distinct mature messenger RNA (mRNA) isoforms are produced from this single gene: Isoform X and Isoform Y.\n\n- **Isoform X** is the full-length version, which includes all 7 exons spliced together in their correct sequence.\n- **Isoform Y** is a variant where exon 3 and exon 5 are both skipped. The remaining exons (1, 2, 4, 6, 7) are spliced together in their original numerical order.\n\nDuring a particular experiment, it is observed that for every 150 primary *Regulin* transcripts that undergo processing, 90 are converted into Isoform X and the remaining 60 are converted into Isoform Y.\n\nCalculate the total number of individual splicing ligation events that occur to process this batch of 150 primary transcripts. A single splicing event is defined as the enzymatic process that removes one continuous intronic sequence and ligates the two flanking exons.", "solution": "We model each splicing ligation event as the removal of one continuous intronic segment with ligation of its two flanking exons, which corresponds to forming one exon-exon junction in the mature mRNA. For a linear transcript containing $E$ exons in the final mRNA, the number of exon-exon junctions (and thus splicing events) required is $E-1$.\n\nFor Isoform X (full-length), the number of exons retained is $E_{X}=7$, so the number of splicing events per transcript is\n$$\ns_{X}=E_{X}-1=7-1=6.\n$$\nFor Isoform Y (with exon 3 and exon 5 skipped), the retained exons are $1,2,4,6,7$, so $E_{Y}=5$, and the number of splicing events per transcript is\n$$\ns_{Y}=E_{Y}-1=5-1=4.\n$$\nGiven $N_{X}=90$ transcripts form Isoform X and $N_{Y}=60$ form Isoform Y, the total number of splicing ligation events $S$ across all processed transcripts is\n$$\nS=N_{X}s_{X}+N_{Y}s_{Y}=90\\cdot 6+60\\cdot 4=540+240=780.\n$$\nTherefore, the total number of individual splicing ligation events is $780$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{780}$$", "id": "2294350"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand the splicing mechanism, scientists must devise experiments that can reveal the transient, intermediate steps of the reaction. This problem puts you in the role of an experimentalist, interpreting the results of a classic primer extension assay designed to pinpoint the exact location of the branch point adenosine, a key player in forming the lariat intermediate. Solving this puzzle requires you to connect a raw experimental result—the length of a DNA fragment on a gel—to a precise molecular event during splicing [@problem_id:2294374].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the splicing mechanism of a single intron within a newly characterized eukaryotic gene, designated *Xenogene*.

A 10-nucleotide-long DNA primer with the sequence `5'-TCGTACATGC-3'` is used for the reaction. This primer is perfectly complementary to the first 10 nucleotides of Exon 2.\n\nThe reaction is initiated with Reverse Transcriptase (RT), an enzyme that synthesizes a complementary DNA (cDNA) strand from an RNA template. During splicing, the branch point adenosine forms an unusual 2'-5' phosphodiester bond to create the lariat structure. This bond blocks the progression of RT. The enzyme is able to synthesize the nucleotide complementary to the branch point adenosine itself, but cannot proceed further.\n\nAfter the reaction, the resulting cDNA products are separated by size on a high-resolution denaturing gel.

In primer extension assays, the length measured on the gel is the total cDNA length, which equals the primer length plus the number of nucleotides added during extension.\n\nLet $P$ denote the primer length, $E$ denote the number of nucleotides synthesized beyond the primer, and $L$ denote the total cDNA length observed. Then:\n$$L = P + E.$$\nBecause RT can incorporate the nucleotide complementary to the branch point adenosine but cannot traverse the unusual $2'-5'$ phosphodiester bond, the extension length $E$ equals the number of intronic nucleotides from the 3' splice junction into the intron up to and including the branch point adenosine. Let $B$ be the distance (in nucleotides) upstream from the 3' splice junction to the branch point adenosine. Then:\n$$E = B.$$\nTherefore:\n$$B = L - P.$$\nThe experiment reports $L = 22$ nucleotides and the primer has $P = 10$ nucleotides, so:\n$$B = 22 - 10 = 12.$$\nThus, the branch point adenosine is located $12$ nucleotides upstream from the 3' splice junction, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2294374"}]}
