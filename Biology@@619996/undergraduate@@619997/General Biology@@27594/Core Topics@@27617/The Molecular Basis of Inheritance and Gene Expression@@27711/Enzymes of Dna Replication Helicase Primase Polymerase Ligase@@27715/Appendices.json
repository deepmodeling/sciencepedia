This first practice uses a thought experiment to isolate the function of DNA polymerase III, the primary engine of DNA synthesis. By imagining a scenario where this enzyme is selectively inhibited [@problem_id:2293388], we can clearly visualize the molecular consequences of halting replication after initiation but before elongation, revealing the crucial dependency of the process on each sequential step.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the effects of a new experimental drug, \"Elongastop,\" on a culture of *Escherichia coli*. The drug is known to be a highly specific non-competitive inhibitor of the primary replicating enzyme, DNA polymerase III, completely blocking its catalytic activity. However, Elongastop has no discernible effect on other key enzymes involved in Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) replication, such as helicase, primase, and DNA ligase.\n\nThe bacterial culture is synchronized, so all cells begin DNA replication from the single origin of replication, *oriC*, at the same time. The drug is added simultaneously with the signal that initiates replication. After a short period, sufficient for initiation and some elongation to normally occur, the researcher isolates and analyzes the state of the macromolecules at the newly formed replication forks.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete description of the expected molecular state at the replication forks in the drug-treated *E. coli* cells?\n\nA. The parental DNA double helix remains fully wound, and no new nucleic acids are synthesized, as the replication complex fails to form.\n\nB. Numerous short DNA fragments (Okazaki fragments) are synthesized on the lagging strand, but full-length leading strands are not formed.\n\nC. Short RNA molecules are found attached to both the leading and lagging template strands, but they are not extended with any new DNA.\n\nD. A continuous, full-length leading strand is synthesized, but the lagging strand consists only of un-joined RNA-DNA hybrid primers.\n\nE. The DNA is successfully unwound into two single strands, but no synthesis of any kind occurs because primase cannot function without active DNA polymerase III.", "solution": "DNA polymerase III is the primary replicative polymerase in Escherichia coli, responsible for extending RNA primers to synthesize the continuous leading strand and discontinuous lagging strand DNA (Okazaki fragments). A highly specific non-competitive inhibitor that completely blocks its catalytic activity eliminates DNA chain elongation from primers on both strands because polymerase activity is required for incorporation of deoxyribonucleotides. Non-competitive inhibition reduces the effective catalytic capacity irrespective of substrate concentration, so increasing dNTPs cannot overcome the block.\n\nHelicase (DnaB) unwinds the parental duplex at oriC and continues to separate the strands at the replication forks because the drug does not affect helicase. Primase (DnaG), which is recruited by the helicase within the primosome, synthesizes short RNA primers de novo on single-stranded DNA. On the leading strand template, primase makes one primer near the origin; on the lagging strand template, primase repeatedly lays down primers as helicase exposes new template segments. Because DNA polymerase III is inhibited, these RNA primers cannot be extended into DNA on either strand. DNA ligase requires adjacent DNA termini to seal nicks and does not ligate RNA to DNA; moreover, without DNA synthesis there are no DNA-DNA junctions to ligate. Therefore, no Okazaki DNA fragments are produced, and no full-length leading strand is synthesized. The replication complex can assemble and unwinding occurs, so it is not the case that the duplex remains fully wound or that primase is inactive.\n\nConsequently, the expected molecular state at replication forks is that the DNA has been unwound and short RNA primers synthesized by primase are present on both the leading and lagging templates, but none are extended with DNA due to the complete block of DNA polymerase III. This corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2293388"}, {"introduction": "While the leading strand is synthesized in one continuous piece, the lagging strand presents a unique challenge: it is built from numerous short sections called Okazaki fragments. This practice shifts our focus to the final, crucial step of lagging strand maturation: sealing the gaps between these fragments. By modeling a scenario where DNA ligase is inactive [@problem_id:2293349], you will move beyond a qualitative description and quantitatively determine the precise number of unsealed bonds, or 'nicks', that accumulate, providing a concrete measure of the ligase's workload.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the replication of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is a complex process initiated at origins of replication. Due to the antiparallel nature of the DNA double helix and the inherent 5' to 3' directionality of DNA polymerase activity, the two newly synthesized strands are formed via different mechanisms. One new strand, known as the 'leading strand', is synthesized as a single, continuous polymer. In contrast, the other new strand, the 'lagging strand', is synthesized discontinuously in short segments called Okazaki fragments. These fragments are subsequently joined by the enzyme DNA ligase, which forms phosphodiester bonds to create a continuous sugar-phosphate backbone.\n\nImagine a specialized in vitro replication system designed to study this process. A linear DNA molecule with a total length, $L$, of $4.2 \\times 10^6$ base pairs is used as a template. Replication is initiated simultaneously from a single origin located exactly at the center of this molecule and proceeds bidirectionally towards the ends. A specific inhibitor is present that completely blocks the function of DNA ligase. Under these conditions, the synthesis of the lagging strands produces Okazaki fragments with a uniform length, $F_{len}$, of 200 base pairs each.\n\nCalculate the total number of unsealed phosphodiester bonds (nicks) that will be present in the sugar-phosphate backbones of the newly synthesized lagging strands after the entire DNA segment has been fully replicated.", "solution": "DNA replication from a single central origin proceeds bidirectionally, creating two replication forks. At each fork, one new strand is synthesized continuously (leading), and the other is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments (lagging). Only the lagging strands contribute unsealed phosphodiester bonds (nicks) when DNA ligase is inhibited.\n\nEach fork replicates half the molecule, so the length replicated per lagging strand is $L/2$. With uniform Okazaki fragment length $F_{len}$, the number of Okazaki fragments per lagging strand is\n$$\nN_{\\text{frag}}=\\frac{L/2}{F_{len}}=\\frac{L}{2F_{len}}.\n$$\nWithin a chain of $N_{\\text{frag}}$ fragments, the number of junctions (bonds that ligase would seal) is $N_{\\text{frag}}-1$. Therefore, the number of nicks per lagging strand is\n$$\nN_{\\text{nick, per strand}}=N_{\\text{frag}}-1=\\frac{L}{2F_{len}}-1.\n$$\nThere are two lagging strands (one per fork), so the total number of nicks is\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}}=2\\left(\\frac{L}{2F_{len}}-1\\right)=\\frac{L}{F_{len}}-2.\n$$\nSubstituting $L=4.2\\times 10^{6}$ base pairs and $F_{len}=200$ base pairs,\n$$\n\\frac{L}{F_{len}}=\\frac{4.2\\times 10^{6}}{200}=2.1\\times 10^{4}=21000,\n$$\nso\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}}=21000-2=20998.\n$$\nThis counts the internal unsealed phosphodiester bonds between adjacent Okazaki fragments on both lagging strands; termini at the origin-proximal and end-proximal ends are not counted as nicks.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20998}$$", "id": "2293349"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice elevates the analysis from the role of individual enzymes to the dynamics of the entire replication fork as an integrated system. Real-world biological processes are often governed by the slowest, rate-limiting step, which can vary depending on cellular conditions. This advanced problem asks you to construct a quantitative model [@problem_id:2293347] that predicts the overall velocity of the replication fork based on the kinetic properties of both helicase and DNA polymerase, offering insight into how cellular resources like energy ($ATP$) and building blocks (dNTPs) co-regulate the speed of genome duplication.", "problem": "In a simplified quantitative model of a prokaryotic replication fork, the overall velocity of fork progression, $V_{fork}$, is determined by the speed of the slowest enzyme in the replisome. We consider two key enzymes: the replicative helicase, which unwinds the DNA, and the DNA polymerase, which synthesizes the new strands. The velocity of the helicase, $V_{hel}$, is dependent on the cellular energy charge, which we model using the ratio of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), denoted as $R = [ATP]/[ADP]$. The velocity of the polymerase, $V_{pol}$, is dependent on the total concentration of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), denoted as $[N]$.\n\nThe operational speeds of these enzymes are given by the following expressions:\n1.  Helicase velocity: $V_{hel} = V_{hel,max} \\frac{R}{K_{A} + R}$\n2.  Polymerase velocity: $V_{pol} = \\frac{V_{pol,max} [N]}{K_{M,pol} + [N]}$\n\nHere, $V_{hel,max}$ and $V_{pol,max}$ are the respective maximum velocities of the two enzymes. $K_{A}$ is the activation constant for the helicase, representing the energy charge ratio $R$ at which the helicase operates at half its maximum speed. $K_{M,pol}$ is the Michaelis constant for the polymerase with respect to its dNTP substrates. The overall replication fork velocity is given by $V_{fork} = \\min(V_{hel}, V_{pol})$.\n\nA bacterial cell culture is grown under conditions where the total dNTP concentration, $[N]$, is held constant, causing the DNA polymerase to operate at exactly 80% of its maximum velocity ($V_{pol} = 0.80 \\cdot V_{pol,max}$). Furthermore, the intrinsic maximum speed of the helicase is 50% greater than that of the polymerase, such that $V_{hel,max} = 1.5 \\cdot V_{pol,max}$.\n\nUnder these conditions, what must the numerical value of the energy charge ratio, $R$, be for the replication fork to achieve an actual velocity of exactly 60% of the polymerase's absolute maximum velocity ($V_{fork} = 0.60 \\cdot V_{pol,max}$)? Express your answer for $R$ as a symbolic expression in terms of the constant $K_{A}$.", "solution": "We are given the enzyme velocities:\n$$V_{hel} = V_{hel,max}\\frac{R}{K_{A}+R}, \\quad V_{pol} = \\frac{V_{pol,max}[N]}{K_{M,pol}+[N]}.$$\nUnder the stated conditions, $[N]$ is held such that $V_{pol} = 0.80\\,V_{pol,max} = \\frac{4}{5}V_{pol,max}$, and $V_{hel,max} = 1.5\\,V_{pol,max} = \\frac{3}{2}V_{pol,max}$.
