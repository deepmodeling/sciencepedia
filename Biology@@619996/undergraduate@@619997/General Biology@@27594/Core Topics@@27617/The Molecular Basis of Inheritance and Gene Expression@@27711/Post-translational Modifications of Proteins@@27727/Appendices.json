Two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis is a powerful technique that separates proteins based on both their molecular weight and their isoelectric point ($pI$). This exercise challenges you to work backward from a classic 2D gel pattern—a series of spots with the same mass but different $pI$ values—to deduce the specific, reversible PTM responsible for this signature [@problem_id:2331147].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying a newly identified regulatory protein, which we will call \"Regulin,\" isolated from a mammalian cell line. The a priori calculated molecular weight of Regulin based on its amino acid sequence is approximately 50 kilodaltons (kDa). To investigate its cellular state, the biologist performs two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis on a total protein extract. In this technique, proteins are first separated horizontally based on their isoelectric point (pI), which is the pH at which a protein carries no net electrical charge. Subsequently, they are separated vertically in a second dimension based on their molecular weight.\n\nThe result of the experiment reveals that Regulin does not appear as a single spot. Instead, it is resolved into a series of four distinct spots arranged in a horizontal line. All four spots correspond to a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa, but each spot has a progressively more acidic (lower) isoelectric point. This pattern suggests that Regulin exists in multiple forms within the cell, all derived from a single gene product.\n\nGiven this observation, which of the following reversible Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) is the most plausible cause for the appearance of this series of spots for the protein Regulin?\n\nA. Phosphorylation\nB. Polyubiquitination\nC. N-linked glycosylation\nD. Proteolytic cleavage\nE. Farnesylation", "solution": "Principle of the technique: In two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, dimension one is isoelectric focusing, which separates proteins by isoelectric point, $pI$, defined as the pH at which the protein’s net charge is zero. Dimension two is SDS-PAGE, which separates by molecular mass, because SDS denatures proteins and imposes a roughly constant charge-to-mass ratio; thus, proteins of the same mass align horizontally as spots with the same vertical position.\n\nObservation to interpret: The protein Regulin appears as four spots aligned horizontally at approximately the same molecular mass, $M \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, but at progressively lower $pI$ values (more acidic). Therefore, the modification responsible must:\n- Leave the molecular mass effectively unchanged across the isoforms in SDS-PAGE, and\n- Incrementally add negative charge, thereby lowering $pI$ in discrete steps and generating a horizontal series of spots.\n\nEvaluation of candidate PTMs:\n- Phosphorylation: Addition of a phosphate group introduces negative charge (the phosphate group contributes negative charge near neutral pH; effectively each addition decreases the net positive charge at a given pH). Let $n$ be the number of phosphates. Then as $n$ increases, the net charge at any given pH becomes more negative, so the $pI$ decreases monotonically with $n$. This yields a series of isoforms with identical $M$ but progressively lower $pI$. The mass change per phosphate is small relative to $50\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, so the vertical position remains effectively constant in SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation is reversible via kinases and phosphatases.\n- Polyubiquitination: Each ubiquitin adds about $8.5\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, so the molecular mass would increase substantially with each addition, shifting spots vertically. This does not match constant mass.\n- N-linked glycosylation: Adds oligosaccharides that significantly increase mass and often heterogeneously, typically producing vertical shifts. While sialylation can add negative charge, the mass heterogeneity would not maintain a constant vertical position. It is also not generally a rapidly reversible regulatory PTM in the way phosphorylation is.\n- Proteolytic cleavage: Changes mass and is typically irreversible, contradicting both constant mass and reversibility.\n- Farnesylation: Adds a hydrophobic isoprenoid with small mass and minimal effect on net charge; would not produce a series of progressively more acidic isoforms. It is not typically a reversible modification yielding multiple charged states.\n\nConclusion: A small, reversible, charge-adding modification that preserves mass in SDS-PAGE and yields multiple acidic isoforms is most consistent with phosphorylation. The four spots plausibly correspond to $n=0,1,2,3$ phosphorylations, each lowering $pI$ while maintaining $M \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2331147"}, {"introduction": "Phosphorylation's role extends beyond static properties; it is a dynamic switch that governs complex cellular processes like signal transduction. This problem explores the activation mechanism of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs), which rely on trans-autophosphorylation within a dimer. You will model a common experimental and therapeutic strategy by quantifying how a \"kinase-dead\" mutant can interfere with this process, acting as a dominant-negative inhibitor to shut down a signaling pathway [@problem_id:2331112].", "problem": "A specific family of cell surface receptors, known as Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs), plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways that control growth and proliferation. Upon binding to its specific extracellular ligand, an RTK monomer dimerizes with another monomer. This dimerization brings the intracellular kinase domains of the two monomers into close proximity, allowing them to phosphorylate each other on specific tyrosine residues. This process is called trans-autophosphorylation. For this particular RTK, a dimer must be fully, i.e., doubly, phosphorylated (with each monomer phosphorylated by its partner) to become a signaling-competent unit that can activate downstream pathways. Dimer species that are unphosphorylated or only partially (singly) phosphorylated are completely inactive.\n\nA research team is studying a gain-of-function mutation in this RTK that leads to cancer. As a potential therapeutic strategy, they engineer a kinase-dead (KD) version of the receptor. This KD mutant is identical to the wild-type (WT) receptor in its ability to bind ligand and form dimers, but its kinase domain is catalytically inactive and cannot phosphorylate any target.\n\nThe team creates a stable cell line that co-expresses the endogenous WT receptor and the engineered KD receptor. They measure the steady-state concentrations of the two receptor types on the cell surface and find that the concentration of KD monomers is 2.5 times the concentration of WT monomers. Assume that in the presence of a saturating amount of ligand, all receptors form dimers, and the pairing of monomers into dimers is a completely random process governed by their relative surface concentrations.\n\nCalculate the total signaling activity in this engineered cell line as a fraction of the maximum possible signaling activity. The maximum possible activity is defined as the activity of a hypothetical cell line containing the same total number of receptors, but where all receptors are of the WT type. Express your answer as a dimensionless decimal fraction, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the signaling activity of a cell line co-expressing wild-type (WT) and kinase-dead (KD) receptors, relative to a cell line expressing only WT receptors at the same total concentration. The key principle is that signaling activity originates only from fully phosphorylated WT-WT dimers.\n\nLet $C_{WT}$ be the concentration of WT receptor monomers and $C_{KD}$ be the concentration of KD receptor monomers on the cell surface. The problem states that $C_{KD} = 2.5 \\times C_{WT}$.\n\nThe total concentration of receptor monomers is $C_{Total} = C_{WT} + C_{KD} = C_{WT} + 2.5 C_{WT} = 3.5 C_{WT}$.\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen monomer for dimerization is a WT monomer is the fraction of WT monomers in the total pool:\n$$p_{WT} = \\frac{C_{WT}}{C_{Total}} = \\frac{C_{WT}}{3.5 C_{WT}} = \\frac{1}{3.5}$$\n\nSimilarly, the probability that a randomly chosen monomer is a KD monomer is:\n$$p_{KD} = \\frac{C_{KD}}{C_{Total}} = \\frac{2.5 C_{WT}}{3.5 C_{WT}} = \\frac{2.5}{3.5} = \\frac{5}{7}$$\nNote that $p_{WT} + p_{KD} = \\frac{1}{3.5} + \\frac{2.5}{3.5} = \\frac{3.5}{3.5} = 1$, as expected.\n\nSince dimerization is a random process involving the pairing of two monomers, we can calculate the probabilities of forming the three possible types of dimers:\n1.  A WT-WT dimer: The probability of this is $P(\\text{WT-WT}) = p_{WT} \\times p_{WT} = p_{WT}^2$.\n2.  A KD-KD dimer: The probability of this is $P(\\text{KD-KD}) = p_{KD} \\times p_{KD} = p_{KD}^2$.\n3.  A WT-KD heterodimer: The probability of picking one WT and one KD monomer is $p_{WT} \\times p_{KD}$, but this can happen in two orders (WT first, then KD; or KD first, then WT). So, the total probability is $P(\\text{WT-KD}) = 2 \\times p_{WT} \\times p_{KD}$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, signaling activity comes *only* from fully, doubly-phosphorylated dimers. Let's analyze the activity of each dimer type:\n-   **WT-WT dimer:** Each WT monomer can phosphorylate the other. This dimer becomes fully phosphorylated and is signaling-competent. Let's assign its relative activity as 1.\n-   **WT-KD dimer:** The WT monomer can phosphorylate the KD monomer, but the KD monomer's inactive kinase domain cannot phosphorylate the WT monomer. This results in a singly phosphorylated, or partially phosphorylated, dimer. The problem states these are inactive. So, its relative activity is 0.\n-   **KD-KD dimer:** Neither monomer has kinase activity. This dimer remains unphosphorylated and is inactive. Its relative activity is 0.\n\nTherefore, the total signaling activity in the engineered cell line is proportional to the fraction of dimers that are of the WT-WT type.\n$$ \\text{Activity}_{\\text{engineered}} \\propto P(\\text{WT-WT}) = p_{WT}^2 $$\n\nNow, we consider the reference case: a hypothetical cell line with the same total receptor concentration, $C_{Total}$, but consisting entirely of WT receptors. In this case, $C_{WT} = C_{Total}$ and $C_{KD} = 0$. The probability of picking a WT monomer is $p'_{WT} = 1$. All dimers formed are WT-WT dimers, and all are active. The fraction of active dimers is $P'(\\text{WT-WT}) = (p'_{WT})^2 = 1^2 = 1$. This represents the maximum possible signaling activity.\n$$ \\text{Activity}_{\\text{max}} \\propto 1 $$\n\nThe question asks for the signaling activity as a fraction of the maximum possible activity. This is the ratio of the two activities:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Activity} = \\frac{\\text{Activity}_{\\text{engineered}}}{\\text{Activity}_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{p_{WT}^2}{1} = p_{WT}^2 $$\n\nNow we substitute the value of $p_{WT}$ we calculated for the engineered cell line:\n$$ p_{WT} = \\frac{1}{3.5} = \\frac{1}{7/2} = \\frac{2}{7} $$\n$$ \\text{Fractional Activity} = \\left(\\frac{2}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{49} $$\n\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$$ \\frac{4}{49} \\approx 0.08163265... $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives 0.0816.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0816}$$", "id": "2331112"}]}
