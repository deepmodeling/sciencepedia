Here, we investigate the consequence of a deletion of exactly three base pairs, a number perfectly matching the length of a single codon [@problem_id:2296661]. Analyzing this scenario will solidify your understanding of the genetic \"reading frame\" and reveal the difference between an in-frame mutation, which excises a discrete unit, and a frameshift mutation, which scrambles the entire downstream message.", "problem": "In molecular genetics, the sequence of nucleotides in a gene's coding region is read by the ribosome in successive, non-overlapping groups of three, known as codons. This establishes a \"reading frame\" for protein synthesis. A medical research team is studying a genetic disorder and sequences the responsible gene from an affected individual. They compare it to the gene from a healthy individual and find a single, specific mutation: a deletion of exactly three consecutive base pairs from the middle of an exon. Analysis of the protein produced from the mutated gene reveals that it is missing a single amino acid compared to the normal protein, but the entire amino acid sequence following the deletion site is identical to the normal protein.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following statements most accurately classifies this genetic event?\n\nA.

A frameshift mutation arises when an insertion or deletion changes the number of nucleotides by a value not divisible by $3$, thereby shifting the reading frame and altering all downstream codons and the amino acid sequence after the mutation site.\n\nIn the described case, exactly $3$ consecutive base pairs are deleted from the coding region. Deleting $3$ nucleotides removes exactly one codon but preserves the original reading frame for all downstream codons.

The original, or wild-type, version of the gene produces a fully functional enzyme.\n\nIn a first experiment, the biologist introduces a mutation by inserting a single guanine (G) nucleotide into the coding strand of the DNA. This insertion occurs immediately after the last nucleotide of codon 49. The resulting mutant strain produces a completely non-functional protein.\n\nIn a second experiment, the biologist takes this non-functional mutant strain and induces a second mutation. This subsequent mutation involves the deletion of a single adenine (A) nucleotide. This deletion occurs at the position corresponding to the first nucleotide of what would have been codon 70 in the original, wild-type sequence.\n\nAnalysis of this new, doubly mutated strain reveals that it produces a full-length protein (300 amino acids long) that exhibits partial, but not complete, enzymatic activity.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the amino acid sequence of the protein produced by the doubly mutated gene, when compared to the wild-type protein?\n\nA. The insertion and deletion perfectly cancel each other out, so the amino acid sequence of the new protein is identical to the wild-type sequence.\n\nB. The amino acid sequence is correct up to amino acid 49, after which the rest of the protein's sequence (amino acids 50-300) is completely different from the wild-type.\n\nC. The amino acid sequence is identical to the wild-type, except for a single incorrect amino acid at position 50 and another at position 70.\n\nD. The amino acid sequence is identical to the wild-type for the first 49 amino acids and for the amino acids from position 70 to 300, but the sequence from amino acid 50 to 69 is completely altered.\n\nE. The combination of mutations results in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein that is only 69 amino acids long.", "solution": "Let the wild-type coding sequence consist of nucleotides $b_{1},b_{2},\\dots,b_{900}$ encoding $300$ amino acids. In the wild type, codon $n$ uses nucleotides\n$$\n[3n-2,\\,3n-1,\\,3n].\n$$\nThus codon $49$ uses $[145,146,147]$, codon $50$ uses $[148,149,150]$, and codon $70$ uses $[208,209,210]$.\n\nFirst mutation (insertion of one nucleotide after the last base of codon $49$): a single base is inserted between $b_{147}$ and $b_{148}$. For any original base $b_{i}$ with $i\\geq 148$, its index in the mutated sequence increases by $1$, so its frame class relative to the start codon shifts by\n$$\n\\Delta f \\equiv +1 \\pmod{3}.\n$$\nTherefore, beginning immediately after codon $49$, the reading frame is shifted by $+1$, so amino acids from position $50$ onward are altered, typically leading to loss of function due to missense and often premature termination (consistent with the observed nonfunctional protein).\n\nSecond mutation (deletion of one nucleotide at the position corresponding to the first base of wild-type codon $70$, i.e., original $b_{208}$): remove $b_{208}$. For any original base $b_{i}$ with $i>208$, the net index shift due to the two mutations is\n$$\n(+1)\\;-\\;1 \\;=\\;0,\n$$\nso the frame class downstream of the deletion is restored,\n$$\n\\Delta f \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.\n$$\nHence, from immediately after the deletion site, the codon partition realigns with the wild-type frame. Between the two mutation sites (from just after $b_{147}$ up to the deletion of $b_{208}$), the frame is shifted by $+1$, so the amino acids encoded in this interval are different from wild type.\n\nTo locate the altered segment in amino acid numbering:\n- Up to codon $49$ (amino acids $1$ to $49$), no nucleotides were changed before their translation, so these amino acids are identical to wild type.\n- The frameshift introduced after $b_{147}$ persists through the region that would encompass wild-type codons $50$ through $69$. Thus amino acids $50$ through $69$ are specified by a shifted reading frame and are different from wild type.\n- The downstream deletion restores the original frame at the site corresponding to the start of wild-type codon $70$, so from that point onward the amino acid sequence realigns with wild type, producing a full-length protein. This explains why the enzyme has partial activity: the internal stretch is altered, but the remainder, including domains beyond that region, is identical.\n\nAmong the options, this corresponds to the description that the first $49$ amino acids match wild type, the segment from $50$ to $69$ is altered, and the remainder matches wild type again.
