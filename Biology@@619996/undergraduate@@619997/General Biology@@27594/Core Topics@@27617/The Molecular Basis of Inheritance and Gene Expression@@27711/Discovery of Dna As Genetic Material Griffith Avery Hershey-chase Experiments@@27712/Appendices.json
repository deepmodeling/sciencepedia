{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Frederick Griffith's 1928 experiment was a cornerstone in genetics, revealing that a \"transforming principle\" could transfer heritable traits between bacteria. This practice problem challenges you to think critically about the distinction between the genetic transformation itself and the ultimate expression of a trait, such as virulence. By considering a hypothetical scenario where the physical manifestation of virulence—the polysaccharide capsule—is targeted, you can deepen your understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype. [@problem_id:2289984]", "problem": "In his 1928 experiments, Frederick Griffith investigated two strains of the bacterium *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. The S-strain (smooth) possesses a polysaccharide capsule that protects it from the host's immune system, making it virulent and causing death in mice. The R-strain (rough) lacks this capsule and is therefore non-virulent, allowing the host's immune system to destroy it.\n\nGriffith's key observations were:\n1.  Injection of live S-strain into mice resulted in their death.\n2.  Injection of live R-strain into mice did not harm them.\n3.  Injection of heat-killed S-strain into mice did not harm them.\n4.  Injection of a mixture of heat-killed S-strain and live R-strain into mice resulted in their death, and live S-strain bacteria were recovered from the dead mice. This phenomenon was termed transformation.\n\nConsider a hypothetical follow-up experiment. A scientist prepares a mixture containing three components: heat-killed S-strain bacteria, live R-strain bacteria, and a purified enzyme that specifically and efficiently degrades the polysaccharide capsule of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. This entire mixture is then injected into a healthy mouse. Assume the enzyme remains active within the mouse for the duration of the experiment.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of this hypothetical experiment and the underlying reason?\n\nA. The mouse will die because the enzyme has no effect on the \"transforming principle,\" allowing the R-strain to be converted into fully virulent S-strain.\n\nB. The mouse will live because although transformation occurs, the newly formed S-strain bacteria will have their capsules destroyed by the enzyme, rendering them non-virulent.\n\nC. The mouse will live because the enzyme will degrade the \"transforming principle\" (which is made of polysaccharide) before it can be taken up by the R-strain bacteria.\n\nD. The mouse will die because the fragments of the degraded capsules act as a potent toxin when combined with the R-strain.\n\nE. The mouse will live because the heat-killed S-strain and the enzyme will neutralize each other, leaving only the harmless R-strain to be cleared by the immune system.", "solution": "Griffith’s observations establish that virulence in Streptococcus pneumoniae depends on the presence of a polysaccharide capsule (S phenotype), and that non-encapsulated R bacteria can become virulent after exposure to material from heat-killed S cells via transformation. The underlying genetic material responsible for this conversion (the “transforming principle”) was later shown by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty to be DNA, not polysaccharide or protein.\n\nIn the hypothetical experiment, the mixture contains:\n- Heat-killed S cells (source of S-strain DNA, including genes for capsule biosynthesis).\n- Live R cells (competent recipients that can take up DNA and be transformed).\n- An enzyme that specifically and efficiently degrades the polysaccharide capsule, and remains active for the duration.\n\nLogical steps:\n1. The presence of heat-killed S cells provides S-strain DNA in the environment. By the established principle of transformation, live R cells can take up this DNA and integrate genes that encode the capsule biosynthesis pathway, thereby genetically converting to an S-genotype.\n2. The enzyme in the mixture targets only the polysaccharide capsule; it does not degrade DNA. Therefore, it does not prevent the uptake of S DNA nor the genetic transformation of R to S.\n3. Virulence in mice requires an intact capsule to evade phagocytosis. Even if R cells are transformed to carry and express capsule biosynthesis genes, the active capsule-degrading enzyme will remove any synthesized capsule from their surface.\n4. Without an intact capsule, the transformed bacteria will phenotypically resemble non-virulent R-type cells and will be cleared by the host immune system.\n5. Therefore, the mouse will live, not because transformation is blocked, but because the virulence factor (the capsule) is continuously neutralized by the enzyme.\n\nAmong the options:\n- A is incorrect because, although the enzyme does not affect DNA, the bacteria will not become fully virulent due to capsule degradation.\n- B is correct: transformation can occur, but the enzyme removes the capsule, preventing virulence.\n- C is incorrect because the transforming principle is DNA, not polysaccharide.\n- D is incorrect because capsule fragments are not known to act as toxins in this context.\n- E is incorrect because there is no neutralization between heat-killed S material and the enzyme; the R-strain remains subject to transformation, but virulence is blocked at the capsule level.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the mouse will live because transformation may occur, but the enzyme removes the capsule required for virulence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2289984"}, {"introduction": "The work of Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty was a masterpiece of biochemical deduction, designed to isolate and identify Griffith's transforming principle. Their success hinged on the systematic elimination of candidate molecules using specific enzymes. This exercise explores the critical importance of experimental purity by posing a \"what-if\" scenario: what if one of their enzymes was contaminated? By working through the consequences of this hypothetical error, you will gain a profound appreciation for how easily experimental artifacts can lead to incorrect conclusions, reinforcing the true logic of their findings. [@problem_id:2290013]", "problem": "In the 1940s, Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty conducted a landmark experiment to identify the \"transforming principle\" first observed by Frederick Griffith. Their general procedure involved preparing an extract from heat-killed, virulent, smooth-capsule (S-strain) *Streptococcus pneumoniae* bacteria. This extract, containing the transforming principle, could convert non-virulent, rough-capsule (R-strain) bacteria into the S-strain. To identify the molecule responsible, they treated separate batches of the S-strain extract with different enzymes before mixing them with live R-strain bacteria.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a research team attempts to replicate this experiment. However, the vial of protease they use is unknowingly contaminated with a small but effective amount of DNase (an enzyme that degrades Deoxyribonucleic acid). The team proceeds, unaware of this contamination. They treat one batch of the S-strain extract with this contaminated protease and then mix it with a culture of live R-strain bacteria.\n\nBased on the expected observation from this specific treatment, which of the following conclusions would the research team most likely draw?\n\nA. Transformation will proceed normally, leading the researchers to correctly rule out protein as the transforming principle.\n\nB. No transformation will occur, leading the researchers to incorrectly conclude that protein is the transforming principle.\n\nC. No transformation will occur, but because they would get the same result in their separate DNase-treated sample, they would conclude that DNA is the transforming principle.\n\nD. Transformation will be partially inhibited, leading them to conclude that both protein and DNA are necessary for the process.", "solution": "We identify the core logic of the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment: the transforming principle is DNA. The expected outcomes of enzyme treatments are:\n- RNase (degrades RNA): transformation proceeds, since DNA remains intact.\n- Protease (degrades protein): transformation proceeds, since DNA remains intact.\n- DNase (degrades DNA): no transformation, since DNA is the transforming principle.\n\nDefine:\n- Let $T$ denote successful transformation of R-strain to S-strain.\n- Let $D$ denote DNA in the S-strain extract being intact.\n- Let $P$ denote protein in the S-strain extract being intact.\n- Let $E_{P}$ be protease activity and $E_{D}$ be DNase activity.\n\nThe causal dependence is:\n$$D \\Rightarrow T,\\quad \\neg D \\Rightarrow \\neg T,$$\nand protein integrity is not required:\n$$\\neg P \\Rightarrow T.$$\n\nIn the hypothetical scenario, the protease vial is contaminated with an effective amount of DNase. Therefore, the treatment nominally with protease actually applies $E_{P}+E_{D}$ to the extract. The DNase component degrades DNA, so after treatment the state is $\\neg D$, which by the dependence above implies:\n$$\\neg D \\Rightarrow \\neg T.$$\n\nThus, the observed outcome for the protease-treated (but DNase-contaminated) sample is no transformation.\n\nInterpreting this observation under the (incorrect) assumption that only protease was applied, the researchers would attribute loss of transforming activity to protein degradation, and hence conclude that protein is the transforming principle. This conclusion is incorrect because the actual causal agent was DNase destroying DNA.

The experiment's genius lies in its use of radioisotopes—${}^{32}\\text{P}$ for DNA and ${}^{35}\\text{S}$ for protein—to track each component. This problem tests your grasp of the experiment's core principles by substituting the DNA-based phage with a hypothetical RNA-based phage. By predicting the outcome, you can demonstrate a true understanding of the experimental logic, independent of simply memorizing the historical result. [@problem_id:2289997]", "problem": "An experiment is designed to investigate a hypothetical bacteriophage that uses Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) as its genetic material. This is a modification of the classic Hershey-Chase experiment, which originally used a bacteriophage with Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).\n\nTwo separate batches of this RNA phage are prepared:\n1.  In the first batch, the phage's protein capsids are labeled with the radioactive isotope sulfur-35 (${}^{35}\\text{S}$).\n2.  In the second batch, the phage's RNA genome is labeled with the radioactive isotope phosphorus-32 (${}^{32}\\text{P}$).\n\nThese two batches of labeled phages are then used to infect two separate cultures of *E. coli* bacteria. After allowing sufficient time for the phages to infect the bacteria, each culture is agitated in a blender to shear the external phage components from the surface of the bacterial cells. Finally, the cultures are centrifuged, which separates the mixture into a heavier pellet containing the bacterial cells at the bottom of the tube, and a lighter liquid supernatant containing smaller particles.\n\nAssuming the RNA phage infects the bacteria by injecting its genetic material in a manner analogous to the DNA phage used by Hershey and Chase, which of the following outcomes would be expected after measuring the radioactivity in the pellet and supernatant of the two cultures?\n\nA. The ${}^{32}\\text{P}$ radioactivity will be primarily found in the bacterial pellet, while the ${}^{35}\\text{S}$ radioactivity will be primarily found in the liquid supernatant.\n\nB. The ${}^{35}\\text{S}$ radioactivity will be primarily found in the bacterial pellet, while the ${}^{32}\\text{P}$ radioactivity will be primarily found in the liquid supernatant.\n\nC.

Both the ${}^{32}\\text{P}$ and ${}^{35}\\text{S}$ radioactivity will be primarily found in the liquid supernatant.", "solution": "The key principle from the Hershey–Chase experiment is that the genetic material is what enters the bacterial cell during infection, while the protein capsid remains outside and can be sheared off by blending. Centrifugation then separates the heavier bacterial cells into the pellet and leaves the lighter phage ghosts in the supernatant.\n\nFirst, identify the specificity of the radioactive labels. The isotope ${}^{35}\\text{S}$ labels protein because sulfur is found in amino acids such as cysteine and methionine, while nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) do not contain sulfur. The isotope ${}^{32}\\text{P}$ labels nucleic acid because phosphorus is present in the phosphate backbone of RNA (and DNA), whereas proteins do not incorporate phosphorus into their backbone structure under these conditions.\n\nSecond, apply the infection mechanism analogous to the original Hershey–Chase experiment. For a DNA phage, the DNA enters the bacterium while the protein coat remains outside. By the stated assumption that the RNA phage infects in an analogous manner, the RNA genome is what is injected into the bacterial cell, and the protein capsid remains attached externally.\n\nThird, consider the effect of blending and centrifugation. Blending mechanically shears off external phage components (protein coats) from the bacterial surface. Upon centrifugation, the bacterial cells (with any internalized material) sediment into the pellet, and the detached phage coats remain in the supernatant.\n\nTherefore, for the batch with ${}^{32}\\text{P}$-labeled RNA, the label corresponding to the genetic material will enter the cells and be found primarily in the pellet. For the batch with ${}^{35}\\text{S}$-labeled protein capsids, the label will remain with the external phage coats and be found primarily in the supernatant.\n\nHence, the expected outcome is that ${}^{32}\\text{P}$ radioactivity is primarily in the bacterial pellet and ${}^{35}\\text{S}$ radioactivity is primarily in the liquid supernatant, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2289997"}]}
