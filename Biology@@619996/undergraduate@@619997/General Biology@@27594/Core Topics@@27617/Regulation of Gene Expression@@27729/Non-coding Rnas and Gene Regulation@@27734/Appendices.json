This powerful technique works by co-opting a natural, evolutionarily conserved pathway that cells use for post-transcriptional regulation. This exercise challenges you to identify this fundamental cellular mechanism based on the experimental setup, connecting a common laboratory tool to its endogenous biological origin. [@problem_id:2304796]", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the function of a newly discovered gene, *Gene-Y*, which is highly expressed in cultured human liver cells. To study the effect of its absence, the biologist designs an experiment to specifically reduce the amount of the protein produced by *Gene-Y*. They synthesize a short, double-stranded Ribonucleic Acid (dsRNA) molecule, approximately 21 base pairs in length, with a nucleotide sequence perfectly complementary to a segment of the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from *Gene-Y*. This synthetic dsRNA is then introduced directly into the cytoplasm of the liver cells. Subsequent analysis confirms a significant and specific decrease in the levels of the protein encoded by *Gene-Y*, while the expression of other genes remains unaffected. This powerful experimental technique works by hijacking a naturally occurring cellular mechanism that regulates gene expression after transcription has occurred.\n\nWhich of the following endogenous cellular pathways is being co-opted by the researcher to achieve this targeted gene silencing?\n\nA. Ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation\n\nB. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay\n\nC. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA\n\nD. RNA interference (RNAi)\n\nE. DNA methylation", "solution": "We begin by identifying the key experimental features: the researcher synthesizes a short double-stranded RNA of length approximately $21$ base pairs, with perfect complementarity to a specific segment of the target mRNA, and introduces it into the cytoplasm. The observed outcome is a significant and specific decrease in the protein product of the targeted gene, with no effect on other genes. The mechanism is explicitly post-transcriptional.\n\nA short dsRNA of approximately $21$ nucleotides that is perfectly complementary to an mRNA is characteristic of small interfering RNA (siRNA). In eukaryotic cells, siRNAs engage the endogenous RNA interference pathway. In this pathway, either Dicer processes longer dsRNA into $21$â€“$23$ nucleotide duplexes or exogenously provided $21$ nucleotide siRNAs are directly loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). An Argonaute protein within RISC uses the guide strand to recognize complementary mRNA; perfect base pairing directs endonucleolytic cleavage (slicing) of the target mRNA, resulting in its degradation and reduced translation, thereby lowering the encoded protein level. This is a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism.\n\nWe now exclude the alternatives:\n- Ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation targets proteins for degradation and does not act via complementary RNA duplexes or target mRNA. It is not a post-transcriptional mRNA-silencing mechanism.\n- Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay requires a premature termination codon and exon junction complex context; it is not triggered by exogenous dsRNA complementarity.\n- Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA occurs in the nucleus during pre-mRNA processing and is not driven by cytoplasmic dsRNA complementarity.\n- DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification affecting transcriptional initiation and chromatin state, not a cytoplasmic, sequence-complementary, post-transcriptional silencing mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the endogenous pathway being co-opted is RNA interference (RNAi).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2304796"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple degradation of messenger RNAs, non-coding RNAs can perform much more complex regulatory tasks.
