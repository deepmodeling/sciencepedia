[@problem_id:2312370]", "problem": "The bacterium *Escherichia coli* utilizes the *lac* operon to regulate the metabolism of lactose. This regulation involves two key mechanisms. First, a repressor protein, the product of the *lacI* gene, binds to a DNA sequence called the operator, preventing transcription of the structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*). The presence of allolactose, an isomer of lactose, inactivates the repressor, allowing transcription to proceed. Second, for transcription to occur at a high rate, the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP) must bind to a site near the promoter. CAP only binds to DNA when it is complexed with cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), a signaling molecule whose concentration is high when glucose levels are low and low when glucose levels are high.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that possesses a mutation in the gene encoding CAP. This mutation alters the protein's structure such that it binds constitutively to the CAP binding site on the DNA, regardless of the concentration of cAMP in the cell. Assume that all other components of the *lac* operon system, including the *lacI* gene and the operator sequence, are wild-type and fully functional.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expression of the *lac* structural genes in this mutant strain?\n\nA. The operon will be expressed at a high level only when lactose is present and glucose is absent.\n\nB. The operon will be expressed at a high level whenever lactose is present, regardless of the glucose concentration.\n\nC. The operon will be expressed constitutively at a high level, regardless of the presence or absence of lactose and glucose.\n\nD. The operon will never be expressed, as the permanent binding of CAP interferes with RNA polymerase function.\n\nE. The operon will be expressed at a low, basal level whenever lactose is present, but it can never be induced to a high level.", "solution": "We analyze lac operon control by two mechanisms: negative control by the LacI repressor at the operator and positive control by CAP at its binding site when complexed with cAMP.\n\nFirst, consider the negative control. In the absence of lactose, LacI binds the operator and blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes. In the presence of lactose, allolactose binds LacI, inactivating it; this removes repression and allows transcriptional initiation from the promoter.\n\nSecond, consider the positive control. In wild type, CAP requires cAMP to bind DNA and stimulate transcription; high cAMP (low glucose) promotes CAP binding and thus strong transcription, while low cAMP (high glucose) prevents CAP binding and thus prevents strong transcription.\n\nIn the mutant described, CAP has a structural change that allows it to bind constitutively to its DNA site regardless of cAMP concentration. Therefore, the positive control is permanently engaged: the activator is always present at the promoter to enhance RNA polymerase recruitment and activity. This eliminates the dependence of high-level transcription on low glucose (high cAMP).\n\nHowever, the LacI repressor and operator are wild type. Therefore, repression remains functional. When lactose is absent, LacI binds the operator and prevents transcription despite CAP being bound; when lactose is present, LacI is inactivated by allolactose, removing repression. With CAP constitutively bound under these conditions, transcription proceeds at high levels.\n\nThus:\n- If lactose is absent, the operon is repressed regardless of glucose, so high-level expression does not occur.\n- If lactose is present, repression is relieved and CAP is already bound, so the operon is expressed at a high level regardless of glucose.\n\nThis pattern matches option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2312370"}, {"introduction": "The 'rules' of gene regulation are direct consequences of protein structure and molecular interactions. This thought experiment probes the fundamental logic of repressor function by asking you to deduce the phenotype of a mutant with an inverted LacI repressor, which binds to DNA *only* in the presence of its inducer, allolactose. This practice forces a deep application of first principles, moving beyond memorization of the wild-type system's behavior. [@problem_id:2312395]", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the *lac* operon is a classic example of an inducible system for gene regulation. The operon's default state is \"off.\" It is controlled by the *lacI* gene, which is located separately from the operon and codes for a repressor protein. In the absence of lactose, this active repressor protein binds to a specific DNA sequence called the operator, which is located near the promoter of the *lac* operon. This binding physically obstructs RNA polymerase, preventing the transcription of the structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*) needed for lactose metabolism. When lactose is present in the cell's environment, it is converted to an isomer, allolactose. Allolactose then acts as an inducer, binding to the repressor protein and causing it to change its three-dimensional shape. This conformational change inactivates the repressor, making it unable to bind to the operator. RNA polymerase can then transcribe the structural genes, turning the operon \"on.\"\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutant strain of *E. coli* that has a mutation in its *lacI* gene.

In its wild-type form, transcription of the operon's structural genes is optimally induced in the presence of lactose and the absence of glucose. This is achieved through two main regulatory mechanisms: negative control by the LacI repressor protein and positive control by the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP). The LacI repressor, encoded by the *lacI* gene, binds to the operator ($O$) sequence in the absence of lactose (or its isomer, allolactose), blocking transcription. The CAP, in a complex with cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), binds to the CAP-binding site near the promoter in the absence of glucose (which leads to high cAMP levels), enhancing the recruitment of RNA polymerase and activating transcription.\n\nA team of synthetic biologists aims to completely invert the logic of the *lac* operon. Their goal is to create a mutant operon that is transcriptionally active **if and only if** lactose is absent from the medium and glucose is present. They must achieve this by introducing mutations *only* into the DNA sequences of the operator ($O$) and the CAP-binding site. All regulatory proteins (LacI, CAP) and RNA polymerase are to remain wild-type.\n\nWhich of the following pairs of mutations would successfully re-engineer the operon to meet the specified goal?\n\nA.

Let $G=1$ denote glucose present and $G=0$ denote glucose absent.

Because proteins are fixed as wild type, only DNA site changes can invert logic. Therefore, we must invert both inputs by repositioning or altering the specificity of their binding sites so that each regulator acts oppositely to its normal effect:\n- For the lactose branch: either make LacI binding occur only when lactose is present (so that binding represses only in the presence of lactose), or somehow convert LacI binding in the absence of lactose into activation. Since we cannot change LacI’s protein contacts to turn it into an activator, the feasible route is to invert the ligand-dependent binding specificity at the operator. If we change the operator sequence so that it is recognized exclusively by allolactose-bound LacI, then\n$$\\mathrm{LacI}_{\\mathrm{bound,mut}}=L.$$\nIf the operator remains overlapping the core promoter, LacI binding will repress when $L=1$ and not repress when $L=0$, achieving the required lactose inversion at the promoter.\n- For the glucose branch: in the wild type, CAP-cAMP is an activator when bound ($\\neg G$). To invert glucose logic using only the CAP-binding site, relocate the CAP site to overlap the core promoter so that CAP-cAMP binding blocks RNA polymerase binding. With this relocation, CAP-cAMP becomes a repressor; since $\\mathrm{CAP}_{\\mathrm{bound}}=\\neg G$, the repression acts precisely when $G=0$, and there is no CAP repression when $G=1$.\n\nCombine these two inversions. With the mutated operator and the relocated CAP site:\n- Repression by LacI occurs iff $L=1$.\n- Repression by CAP occurs iff $G=0$.\nAssuming both sites overlap the core promoter so that either bound factor blocks transcription, transcription occurs only when neither repressor is bound:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{mut}}=\\neg \\mathrm{LacI}_{\\mathrm{bound,mut}} \\land \\neg \\mathrm{CAP}_{\\mathrm{bound}}=\\neg L \\land G,$$\nwhich matches $T_{\\mathrm{goal}}$ exactly.\n\nNow assess each option:\n\nA. $O^{c}$ (no LacI binding) removes lactose dependence entirely. Relocating the CAP site to overlap the promoter makes transcription occur whenever $G=1$, independent of $L$, giving $T=G$, not $\\neg L \\land G$. Reject.\n\nB. Operator redesigned to be bound exclusively by allolactose-bound LacI gives $\\mathrm{LacI}_{\\mathrm{bound,mut}}=L$ and thus repression only when $L=1$. Relocating the CAP site to overlap the promoter makes CAP-cAMP a repressor acting when $G=0$. Therefore $T=\\neg L \\land G$, exactly the goal. Accept.\n\nC. $O^{c}$ plus a CAP site that cannot bind CAP-cAMP eliminates both LacI repression and CAP regulation, yielding constitutive transcription independent of $L$ and $G$. Reject.\n\nD. Operator redesigned to bind only allolactose-bound LacI in the original position yields repression when $L=1$ (good for lactose inversion), but strengthening the original CAP site increases activation when $G=0$ (glucose absent), which promotes transcription under the opposite glucose condition desired. This yields transcription when $L=0$ even if $G=0$, violating the “if and only if glucose present” condition.
