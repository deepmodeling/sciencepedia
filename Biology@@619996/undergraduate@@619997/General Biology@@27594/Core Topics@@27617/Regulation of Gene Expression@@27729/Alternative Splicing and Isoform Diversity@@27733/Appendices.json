This first practice problem places you in the role of a bioinformatician analyzing RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) results. By examining a hypothetical pattern of gene expression data, you will practice the crucial skill of deducing the underlying splicing mechanism, specifically how the presence or absence of sequence reads reveals the behavior of a cassette exon in a specific cellular context. [@problem_id:2277527]", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying a newly discovered gene, `Stellar-Response Factor 1 (SRF1)`, in human muscle tissue. The `SRF1` gene is known from genomic sequencing to be composed of four distinct exons, labeled exon 1 through exon 4 in order along the chromosome. To understand how this gene is expressed, the biologist performs a technique called RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) on messenger RNA (mRNA) isolated from the muscle tissue. The goal of RNA-Seq is to sequence the mRNA molecules present in a sample, which reveals which parts of a gene (the exons) are included in the final, mature transcripts after splicing.\n\nThe results of the RNA-Seq experiment are as follows: many sequence reads align perfectly to the genomic regions corresponding to exon 1, exon 2, and exon 4. However, there are almost no reads that align to exon 3. The sequencing quality and coverage are high and uniform across the rest of the transcriptome, suggesting the result is not a technical artifact.\n\nBased on these observations, what is the most likely biological conclusion regarding the expression of the `SRF1` gene in muscle tissue?\n\nA. Exon 3 is a \"cassette exon\" that is predominantly skipped during the splicing process in this tissue, leading to an mRNA isoform that contains exons 1, 2, and 4.\n\nB. A spontaneous mutation has occurred in the muscle tissue, leading to the deletion of exon 3 from the DNA of the `SRF1` gene.\n\nC. Exon 3 is actually an intron, and the splicing machinery is functioning correctly by removing it from the pre-mRNA.\n\nD. The `SRF1` gene is not expressed in muscle tissue, and the observed reads for exons 1, 2, and 4 are due to experimental noise.\n\nE. The machinery for translating exon 3 into protein is defective, preventing its corresponding mRNA sequence from being stable.", "solution": "1. State the experimental observation and the inference principle: RNA-Seq quantifies the abundance of RNA fragments derived from mature mRNA. Reads aligning to annotated exons indicate inclusion of those exonic regions in stable, spliced transcripts. Conversely, an annotated exon with almost no aligning reads, despite high overall coverage and quality elsewhere, indicates that this region is largely absent from the mature mRNA population in that tissue, consistent with alternative splicing that excludes that exon.\n\n2. Apply the principle to the data: The presence of many reads over exon 1, exon 2, and exon 4 demonstrates that the SRF1 gene is actively transcribed and that these exons are included in the dominant mature isoforms in muscle tissue. The near absence of reads over exon 3 indicates that exon 3 is predominantly not present in the mature transcripts.\n\n3. Evaluate option A (cassette exon skipping): A cassette exon is an exon that can be included or skipped via alternative splicing depending on tissue or condition. The observed pattern—robust coverage over exons 1, 2, and 4 with minimal coverage over exon 3—is the canonical RNA-Seq signature of a cassette exon being skipped, producing an mRNA isoform containing exons 1, 2, and 4. Therefore, option A directly matches the data and known biology of alternative splicing.\n\n4. Rule out option B (genomic deletion in muscle tissue): RNA-Seq profiles RNA, not genomic DNA. A tissue-wide somatic deletion removing exon 3 from the genome is highly improbable and would require genomic DNA evidence. Moreover, alternative splicing is a common and parsimonious explanation for exon-specific loss of RNA-Seq coverage, especially when other exons in the same gene exhibit normal expression.\n\n5. Rule out option C (exon 3 is actually an intron): The gene is annotated from genomic sequencing as having four exons, implying exon 3 is exonic in at least some isoforms or contexts. The absence of exon 3 signal in muscle mRNA reflects tissue-specific splicing choice, not that exon 3 is universally an intron; thus, this option contradicts the given annotation and ignores the commonality of alternative splicing.\n\n6. Rule out option D (gene not expressed): Reads over exons 1, 2, and 4 directly demonstrate expression of SRF1 in muscle. Therefore, the gene is expressed; the pattern specifically implicates exon 3 exclusion rather than global absence of expression.\n\n7. Rule out option E (defective translation machinery affecting exon 3 mRNA stability): Translation occurs after mRNA maturation. A translation defect would not selectively eliminate RNA-Seq reads from exon 3 while preserving exons 1, 2, and 4. While nonsense-mediated decay can reduce abundance of particular isoforms, the simplest and most direct explanation for near-zero reads over exon 3, with strong reads over flanking exons, is exon skipping, not a translational machinery defect.\n\n8. Conclusion: The most likely biological conclusion is that exon 3 functions as a cassette exon predominantly skipped during splicing in muscle tissue, yielding an mRNA isoform comprising exons 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2277527"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how alternative splicing patterns can be observed, we now turn to the mechanisms that control them. The decision to include or skip an exon is governed by a complex code of regulatory elements on the pre-mRNA, which are recognized by specific protein factors. This exercise focuses on a key type of regulatory element, the Intronic Splicing Silencer (ISS), and challenges you to predict how its interaction with an RNA-binding protein dictates the fate of an adjacent exon. [@problem_id:2277591]", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the initial pre-mRNA transcript of a gene often undergoes alternative splicing to produce multiple distinct protein isoforms from a single gene. This process is regulated by sequences within the pre-mRNA called splicing enhancers and silencers, which bind to specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs).\n\nConsider a hypothetical human gene, the *Fictional Regulatory Transmembrane* (*FRT*) gene, which contains five exons (exon 1 through exon 5). Researchers have identified an RNA-binding protein, named Splicing Factor X (SFX), that regulates the splicing of the *FRT* pre-mRNA. They discovered that SFX specifically binds to a sequence known as an Intronic Splicing Silencer (ISS). This particular ISS element is located within the intron that lies between exon 2 and exon 3.\n\nBased on the known function of Intronic Splicing Silencers and the location of this specific ISS element, what is the most likely outcome for the mature *FRT* mRNA when Splicing Factor X is present and actively binds to this ISS?\n\nA. Exon 3 will be excluded from the mature mRNA.\n\nB. Exon 3 will be preferentially included in the mature mRNA.\n\nC. The entire intron between exon 2 and exon 3 will be included in the mature mRNA.\n\nD. Transcription of the *FRT* gene will be terminated prematurely after exon 2.\n\nE. Both exon 2 and exon 3 will be excluded from the mature mRNA.", "solution": "Splicing of pre-mRNA removes introns and joins exons through recognition of splice sites (5-prime donor at the exon-intron boundary and 3-prime acceptor at the intron-exon boundary). Inclusion or exclusion of an exon is regulated by cis-acting elements: exonic or intronic splicing enhancers promote splice-site recognition and exon inclusion, while exonic or intronic splicing silencers reduce splice-site recognition and promote exon skipping. Intronic Splicing Silencers (ISS) are located within introns and, when bound by repressive RNA-binding proteins, inhibit the nearby splice-site usage required to include the adjacent exon.\n\nIn the given gene, the ISS is located within the intron between exon 2 and exon 3. Binding of Splicing Factor X (SFX) to this ISS will repress recognition of the splice sites needed to include exon 3 (principally the 3-prime acceptor at the intron-exon 3 junction, and potentially the paired 5-prime donor from exon 2), thereby decreasing the probability that exon 3 is included. The canonical outcome of an ISS adjacent to an exon is skipping of that exon. Therefore, the most likely result is that exon 3 is excluded from the mature mRNA.\n\nEvaluating alternatives: inclusion of exon 3 would be promoted by an intronic splicing enhancer, not a silencer, so B is unlikely. Intron retention (C) is not the typical outcome of an ISS in this context; instead, exon skipping is favored. Transcription termination (D) is not governed by splicing silencers. Simultaneous exclusion of both exon 2 and exon 3 (E) is not the expected specific effect of a single ISS between them; the repressive effect is targeted to the exon adjacent to the ISS, here exon 3. Thus, the correct choice is exclusion of exon 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2277591"}, {"introduction": "The diversity of protein isoforms generated by alternative splicing can lead to complex functional outcomes beyond simply producing proteins with different activities.

This gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in the production of two distinct protein isoforms from its four exons: TRK-alpha and TRK-beta.\n\nThe functional isoform, TRK-alpha, is translated from an mRNA transcript containing exons 1, 2, and 4. TRK-alpha functions as a kinase only when it forms a homodimer (alpha-alpha).\n\nThe second isoform, TRK-beta, is translated from an mRNA transcript containing all four exons (1, 2, 3, and 4). Exon 3 encodes a peptide sequence that disrupts the catalytic site, rendering TRK-beta catalytically inactive. However, the dimerization domain, encoded by exons 1 and 2, remains intact and identical to that of TRK-alpha.
