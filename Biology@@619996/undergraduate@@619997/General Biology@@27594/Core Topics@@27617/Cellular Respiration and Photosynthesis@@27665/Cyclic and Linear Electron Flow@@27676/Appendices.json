Its mechanism of action is highly specific: it irreversibly binds to and completely inhibits the function of the manganese-containing water-splitting complex associated with Photosystem II (PSII).

Consequently:\n1) Linear electron flow halts once the pre-existing reduced carriers are exhausted, because PSII can no longer supply electrons to plastoquinone.

This problem explores what happens when this link is broken by a chemical agent called a protonophore, which makes the thylakoid membrane \"leaky\" to protons.

This buffer is designed to mimic the cellular environment and contains all necessary precursors for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, including Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP), inorganic phosphate ($P_i$), and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate ($NADP^+$). The suspension is then exposed to a constant, optimal level of illumination, allowing for steady rates of both ATP and NADPH synthesis.\n\nAt a specific time, the scientist introduces a synthetic chemical agent into the suspension. This agent is a protonophore, a lipid-soluble molecule that can bind to protons ($H^+$) and transport them across the thylakoid membrane, effectively making the membrane permeable to protons.\n\nAssuming the chemical has no other effects on the photosynthetic machinery, which of the following outcomes most accurately predicts the immediate changes to the rates of ATP synthesis and NADPH production via linear electron flow after the introduction of the protonophore?\n\nA.

The rate of ATP synthesis will increase, and the rate of NADPH production will decrease.\nE. Both the rate of ATP synthesis and the rate of NADPH production will be completely halted.", "solution": "We begin with chemiosmotic coupling in chloroplast thylakoids. Under illumination, linear electron flow (LEF) transfers electrons from water through photosystem II, the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex, photosystem I, and ferredoxin to ferredoxin–$NADP^+$ reductase, which reduces $NADP^+$ to NADPH. Concurrently, electron transport pumps protons from stroma to lumen (via PSII water oxidation and cytochrome $b_6f$), generating a proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane, which drives ATP synthase to produce ATP from ADP and $P_i$.\n\nThe proton motive force is given by the chemiosmotic relation\n$$\n\\Delta p \\equiv \\Delta \\Psi - \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[H^+]_{\\text{lumen}}}{[H^+]_{\\text{stroma}}} \\right)\n= \\Delta \\Psi - \\frac{2.303\\,RT}{F}\\,\\Delta \\mathrm{pH},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta \\Psi$ is the transmembrane electric potential, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. In chloroplasts, $\\Delta p$ is dominated by the $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ term.\n\nATP synthase flux depends monotonically on $\\Delta p$. Denoting the ATP synthesis rate by $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ and the driving force by $\\Delta p$, we have\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = f(\\Delta p), \\quad \\frac{df}{d(\\Delta p)} > 0,\n$$\nwith $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}} \\to 0$ as $\\Delta p \\to 0$. This is the core of photophosphorylation.\n\nIntroduce a protonophore (uncoupler). This agent increases the conductance to protons across the thylakoid membrane, creating a proton leak current $J_{\\text{leak}}$ that is proportional to $\\Delta p$:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{leak}} = g_{H}\\,\\Delta p,\n$$\nwith $g_{H}$ increased by the protonophore. At steady state, the total proton pumping by LEF, $J_{\\text{pump}}$, is balanced by the sum of proton flows back across the membrane via ATP synthase and the leak:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{pump}} = J_{\\text{H,synthase}} + J_{\\text{leak}}.\n$$\nAs $g_{H}$ becomes large, the steady-state $\\Delta p$ collapses toward zero because the leak term dominates. Consequently, the driving force for ATP synthase is lost, and therefore\n$$\n\\Delta p \\downarrow \\implies J_{\\mathrm{ATP}} \\downarrow \\text{ sharply (toward zero)}.\n$$\n\nNext consider NADPH production via LEF. The rate of NADPH formation, $J_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}$, is directly proportional to the electron flux through the chain, $J_{e^-}$, with the stoichiometry\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{NADPH}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\,J_{e^-},\n$$\nbecause two electrons are required per NADPH. In isolated, illuminated chloroplasts with sufficient $NADP^+$, the LEF rate is governed by excitation of PSII and PSI and by the turnover of the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex. A high $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ (acidic lumen) imposes “photosynthetic control,” slowing electron transfer at the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex. By collapsing $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$, the protonophore relieves this control, reducing backpressure on electron transport. Therefore, immediately after adding the protonophore,\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{pH} \\downarrow \\implies \\text{photosynthetic control relieved at } b_6f \\implies J_{e^-} \\text{ is maintained or increases} \\implies J_{\\mathrm{NADPH}} \\text{ is largely unaffected or may increase},\n$$\nprovided $NADP^+$ is available and the light intensity remains optimal. This conclusion holds for the immediate response because NADPH formation does not require ATP directly; ferredoxin–$NADP^+$ reductase reduces $NADP^+$ using electrons from PSI independently of ATP synthase. Although, over longer times, Calvin cycle consumption of NADPH could become limiting without ATP, the question asks for the immediate changes.\n\nCombining these results:\n- ATP synthesis rate decreases due to collapse of $\\Delta p$.\n- NADPH production via LEF is largely unaffected or may even increase due to relief of photosynthetic control.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2289142"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate purpose of the light reactions is to power the Calvin cycle, which has a strict stoichiometric demand for ATP and NADPH.

Electrons are recycled, which drives proton pumping and ATP synthesis without the production of NADPH or oxygen.
