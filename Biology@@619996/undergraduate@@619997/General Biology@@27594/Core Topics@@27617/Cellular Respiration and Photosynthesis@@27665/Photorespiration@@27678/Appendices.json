A key process limiting photosynthetic efficiency in C3 plants is photorespiration, which is initiated when the enzyme Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) binds with O2 instead of CO2.\n\nThe ratio of the rate of the oxygenase reaction ($v_o$) to the rate of the carboxylase reaction ($v_c$) can be modeled by the following simplified relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{v_o}{v_c} = \\phi \\frac{[O_2]}{[CO_2]}\n$$\nHere, $[O_2]$ and $[CO_2]$ are the effective concentrations of dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide, respectively, in the chloroplast stroma where RuBisCO is located. The term $\\phi$ is the specificity factor of RuBisCO, which describes the enzyme's intrinsic preference for O2 versus CO2 and is known to be temperature-dependent.\n\nThe plant is analyzed under two distinct sets of conditions:\n\n**Condition 1 (Temperate Climate):** The plant is grown in a cool, well-watered environment. The leaf temperature is stable at $22^\\circ\\text{C}$. Under these optimal conditions, the stomata are open, allowing for ample gas exchange. The internal CO2 concentration, $[CO_2]_1$, is measured to be $290 \\text{ ppm}$ (parts per million). The specificity factor of RuBisCO at this temperature is $\\phi_1 = 0.27$.\n\n**Condition 2 (Arid Climate):** The plant is then subjected to a hot, dry day. The leaf temperature rises to $38^\\circ\\text{C}$. To conserve water, the plant's stomata partially close. This closure restricts gas exchange, causing the internal CO2 concentration, $[CO_2]_2$, to drop significantly to $95 \\text{ ppm}$. Due to the change in temperature, the enzyme's specificity factor changes to $\\phi_2 = 0.35$.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume that the internal concentration of dissolved oxygen, $[O_2]$, remains constant for both conditions, corresponding to equilibrium with the atmospheric O2 concentration of $21\\%$.\n\nCalculate the factor by which the ratio of oxygenase to carboxylase activity, $\\frac{v_o}{v_c}$, changes as the plant transitions from Condition 1 to Condition 2.

In the carboxylase reaction, it fixes a molecule of CO2 to a five-carbon sugar, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), initiating the Calvin cycle. In the oxygenase reaction, it instead fixes a molecule of O2 to RuBP, initiating a process called photorespiration.\n\nThe oxygenase reaction of RuBisCO with one molecule of RuBP (a 5-carbon compound) produces one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA, a 3-carbon compound) and one molecule of 2-phosphoglycolate (2-PG, a 2-carbon compound).

The pathway's objective is to recover as much carbon as possible in a form that can be reused by the Calvin cycle. The key transformations and their net energetic requirements are as follows:\n\n1.  The two molecules of 2-phosphoglycolate are processed through a series of reactions in the chloroplast, peroxisome, and mitochondrion, ultimately yielding one molecule of glycerate, one molecule of CO2, and one molecule of ammonia (NH3).
