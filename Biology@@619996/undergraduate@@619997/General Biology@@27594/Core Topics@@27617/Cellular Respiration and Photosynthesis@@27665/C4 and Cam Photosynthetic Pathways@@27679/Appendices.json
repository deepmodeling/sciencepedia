The analysis is focused on the ATP cost per net carbon assimilated.\n\nThe basic energetic requirement for the Calvin cycle, common to both plants, is 3 molecules of ATP per molecule of CO2 assimilated.\n\nIn the C4 plant, an additional carbon-concentrating mechanism is active. This mechanism consumes 2 molecules of ATP for every molecule of CO2 it shuttles to the bundle sheath cells. In doing so, it completely suppresses the oxygenase activity of the enzyme RuBisCO.\n\nIn the C3 plant, under these specific environmental conditions, the enzyme RuBisCO exhibits both carboxylase and oxygenase activity. For every two carboxylation events that successfully fix a molecule of CO2, there is one oxygenation event. Each oxygenation event initiates the photorespiratory pathway, which ultimately results in the net release of one molecule of CO2 and consumes 3.5 molecules of ATP in the process of salvaging the remaining carbon compounds.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total ATP consumed per *net* molecule of CO2 assimilated in the C3 plant to that in the C4 plant under these conditions.

One candidate compound is found to be a potent and non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase. To test its effects, this chemical is sprayed onto a healthy, well-watered maize plant (Zea mays), a known C4 plant, which is kept under optimal light and temperature conditions. Assume the herbicide is absorbed and becomes effective almost instantaneously throughout the plant's leaves. Which of the following statements best describes the most immediate consequence for the carbon fixation process in this maize plant?\n\nA. Carbon fixation in the mesophyll cells would cease, leading to a rapid halt in CO2 supply to the bundle-sheath cells.\n\nB. Carbon fixation would shift entirely to the bundle-sheath cells, proceeding at a reduced rate via the enzyme Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO).\n\nC. The rate of photorespiration would immediately increase, while the overall rate of carbon fixation remains the same.\n\nD. The plant would switch to the Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) pathway for carbon fixation, storing malic acid in the vacuoles overnight.\n\nE. Both the light-dependent reactions and carbon fixation would stop simultaneously because PEP carboxylase activity is directly coupled to ATP synthesis.", "solution": "1) Identify the pathway and key enzymatic step in a C4 plant. In maize (a C4 plant), primary carbon fixation occurs in mesophyll cells via PEP carboxylase, which catalyzes the reaction\n$$\n\\mathrm{PEP} + \\mathrm{HCO_{3}^{-}} \\xrightarrow{\\text{PEP carboxylase}} \\mathrm{OAA} + \\mathrm{P_{i}}.\n$$\nOxaloacetate (OAA) is typically converted to malate (or aspartate), transported to bundle-sheath cells, and decarboxylated to release $CO_{2}$, elevating $CO_{2}$ around RuBisCO and suppressing photorespiration. Thus, the C4 pathway supplies $CO_{2}$ to bundle-sheath RuBisCO.\n\n2) State the kinetic consequence of non-competitive inhibition. A potent non-competitive inhibitor decreases $V_{\\max}$ without changing $K_{M}$. Symbolically, for Michaelis-Menten kinetics with inhibitor concentration $[I]$ and inhibition constant $K_{I}$,\n$$\nV_{\\max}^{\\prime} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}}, \\quad K_{M}^{\\prime} = K_{M},\n$$\nand the reaction rate becomes\n$$\nv = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\prime} [S]}{K_{M} + [S]}.\n$$\nA potent inhibitor (large $[I]$ relative to $K_{I}$) drives $V_{\\max}^{\\prime}$ toward a small value, so $v \\to 0$ even at high $[S]$.\n\n3) Apply the inhibition to the C4 context. Immediate, global inhibition of PEP carboxylase in mesophyll cells causes the flux through the step\n$$\n\\mathrm{PEP} + \\mathrm{HCO_{3}^{-}} \\to \\mathrm{OAA}\n$$\nto collapse ($v \\approx 0$). Therefore:\n- Production of C4 acids (OAA, malate/aspartate) in mesophyll cells ceases.\n- Export of these C4 acids to bundle-sheath cells halts.\n- The $CO_{2}$-concentrating mechanism fails, so the rapid supply of $CO_{2}$ to bundle-sheath RuBisCO is lost.\n\n4) Immediate physiological consequences. With the $CO_{2}$ pump off, bundle-sheath $CO_{2}$ levels drop quickly. RuBisCO loses its high-$CO_{2}$ environment, which would tend to increase photorespiration, but the primary and most immediate effect on carbon fixation is that mesophyll carbon fixation stops, removing the main $CO_{2}$ supply to the bundle sheath. The light-dependent reactions in chloroplast thylakoids are not directly coupled to PEP carboxylase and therefore do not cease immediately.\n\n5) Evaluate options:\n- A: Correct. It directly states the immediate cessation of carbon fixation in mesophyll cells and the consequent rapid halt of $CO_{2}$ supply to bundle-sheath cells.\n- B: Incorrect. There is no complete “shift” of primary fixation to bundle-sheath cells; rather, the concentrating mechanism fails and overall fixation rate declines.\n- C: Incorrect. Photorespiration would tend to increase, but the overall rate of carbon fixation would not remain the same; it would decrease.\n- D: Incorrect. CAM is a distinct adaptation and is not an inducible instantaneous switch in maize under these conditions.\n- E: Incorrect. PEP carboxylase is not directly coupled to ATP synthesis; light reactions continue independently.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the most immediate consequence is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2283048"}, {"introduction": "Biological systems are rarely perfect.
