The experiment involves monitoring key components of the mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain (ETC), the primary pathway for cellular energy production. The ETC involves a series of protein complexes and mobile electron carriers that transfer electrons from donors like NADH and FADH₂ to a final electron acceptor, oxygen. Two critical mobile carriers in this chain are coenzyme Q (also known as ubiquinone) and cytochrome c.\n\nAt a specific point in the experiment, a potent metabolic inhibitor, cyanide, is introduced into the cell culture medium. Cyanide is known to bind irreversibly to one of the components of the ETC. Assume that the cells were in a state of active oxidative phosphorylation with ample supply of electron donors (NADH, FADH₂) and oxygen just before the addition of the inhibitor.\n\nWhat is the immediate effect of the addition of cyanide on the redox state of the majority of molecules in the coenzyme Q pool and the cytochrome c pool?\n\nA. Coenzyme Q becomes more oxidized, and cytochrome c becomes more reduced.\nB. Coenzyme Q becomes more reduced, and cytochrome c becomes more oxidized.\nC. Both coenzyme Q and cytochrome c become more oxidized.\nD. Both coenzyme Q and cytochrome c become more reduced.\nE. The redox states of both pools remain unchanged as the block is downstream of both.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the immediate change in the redox states of coenzyme Q and cytochrome c upon the addition of cyanide to actively respiring cells. To solve this, we must first understand the sequence of electron flow in the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and the specific site of action of cyanide.\n\nStep 1: The standard flow of electrons in the ETC.\nElectrons from NADH enter the ETC at Complex I, and electrons from FADH₂ enter at Complex II. Both Complex I and Complex II transfer their electrons to a mobile lipid-soluble carrier called coenzyme Q (ubiquinone). When coenzyme Q accepts electrons, it is reduced to ubiquinol. Reduced coenzyme Q then moves to Complex III and donates its electrons. Complex III, in turn, transfers these electrons to another mobile carrier, cytochrome c. When cytochrome c accepts an electron, it becomes reduced. Reduced cytochrome c then shuttles the electron to Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). Finally, Complex IV catalyzes the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to the final electron acceptor, molecular oxygen ($O_2$), which is reduced to form water ($H_2O$).\n\nThe simplified sequence of electron flow concerning the components in question is:\nElectron Donors (NADH/FADH₂) $\\rightarrow$ Complex I/II $\\rightarrow$ Coenzyme Q $\\rightarrow$ Complex III $\\rightarrow$ Cytochrome c $\\rightarrow$ Complex IV $\\rightarrow$ Oxygen\n\nStep 2: Identify the site of action of cyanide.\nCyanide is a well-known inhibitor of cellular respiration. Specifically, it binds to the iron atom in the heme group of cytochrome a3, which is a component of Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). This binding prevents Complex IV from transferring electrons to oxygen. Thus, cyanide effectively blocks the ETC at its very last step.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the effect of the block on cytochrome c.\nSince Complex IV is inhibited, it can no longer accept electrons from cytochrome c. However, upstream components (like Complex III) are still trying to pass electrons *to* cytochrome c. This means that cytochrome c molecules will accept electrons but will be unable to pass them on. As a result, the pool of cytochrome c molecules will rapidly accumulate in their reduced state. Therefore, cytochrome c becomes more reduced.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the effect of the block on coenzyme Q.\nThe blockage at Complex IV creates a \"traffic jam\" that propagates backward up the chain. Since cytochrome c is stuck in its reduced state, it cannot accept any more electrons from Complex III. This causes the components of Complex III to remain in their reduced state because they cannot offload their electrons. Consequently, a reduced Complex III cannot accept electrons from coenzyme Q. Coenzyme Q receives electrons from Complexes I and II but is now unable to pass them to Complex III. This inability to be oxidized causes the entire pool of coenzyme Q to accumulate in its reduced form (ubiquinol). Therefore, coenzyme Q also becomes more reduced.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the overall effect.\nThe inhibition of Complex IV by cyanide leads to a backup of electrons throughout the entire chain upstream of the block. Both cytochrome c (immediately upstream) and coenzyme Q (further upstream) become saturated with electrons and accumulate in their reduced states.\n\nBased on this reasoning, both coenzyme Q and cytochrome c become more reduced.

To do this, an experiment is conducted using a suspension of isolated, functional mitochondria in a buffered solution containing an excess of succinate and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$). The rate of oxygen consumption is continuously monitored using an oxygen electrode. The experiment proceeds in three distinct phases:\n\n1.  Initially, the baseline rate of oxygen consumption is measured and found to be low.\n2.  A small, known amount of Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) is added to the suspension. This causes a rapid increase in the rate of oxygen consumption, which then returns to the low baseline rate after a short period.\n3.  Following the return to the baseline rate, Chemical X is added to the suspension. Its addition results in a rapid and sustained increase in the rate of oxygen consumption, reaching a level similar to or even greater than that observed after the addition of ADP.\n\nBased on these observations, what is the most likely mechanism of action for Chemical X on mitochondrial respiration?\n\nA. It inhibits Complex I of the Electron Transport Chain.\nB. It inhibits ATP synthase.\nC. It acts as a chemical uncoupler.\nD. It competitively inhibits the transport of succinate into the mitochondrial matrix.\nE. It inhibits the ADP/ATP translocase, which moves ADP into and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) out of the matrix.", "solution": "The mitochondria are supplied with succinate and inorganic phosphate, so electron input to the electron transport chain (ETC) is at Complex II. In the absence of added ADP, oxidative phosphorylation is demand-limited: ATP synthase has little substrate, proton flux through ATP synthase is minimal, the proton motive force remains high, and the high backpressure on the ETC slows electron flow. In chemiosmotic terms, the proton motive force is $\\Delta p = \\Delta \\psi - \\frac{2.303 RT}{F}\\Delta\\text{pH}$; when $\\Delta p$ is high because proton re-entry is low, the rate of proton pumping (and thus electron transport and $O_2$ consumption) is low. This explains the initial low baseline rate of $O_2$ consumption (resting or State 4 respiration).\n\nWhen a small, known amount of ADP is added, ATP synthase turns over, allowing proton re-entry down $\\Delta p$, thereby lowering $\\Delta p$ and relieving the backpressure on the ETC. Consequently, the proton pumping rate and electron transport increase, and $O_2$ consumption rises (active or State 3 respiration). Once the added ADP is quantitatively converted to ATP, proton flux through ATP synthase ceases, $\\Delta p$ builds again, and the system returns to the low baseline rate (back to State 4). This transient increase and return is the hallmark of tight coupling and normal respiratory control.\n\nUpon addition of Chemical X after the return to baseline, the rate of $O_2$ consumption shows a rapid and sustained increase to a level comparable to or exceeding the ADP-stimulated rate, despite the absence of additional ADP. The only mechanism that produces a sustained high $O_2$ consumption in the absence of ADP utilization is uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation: a protonophoric or leak-inducing agent that increases proton conductance across the inner mitochondrial membrane. In this case, Chemical X introduces a proton leak current $J_{H^{+},\\mathrm{leak}}$ that increases with $\\Delta p$, thereby collapsing or markedly reducing $\\Delta p$ independently of ATP synthase. With $\\Delta p$ kept low by the leak, the ETC runs at or near its maximal rate to attempt to re-establish the gradient, driving sustained high electron transport and $O_2$ consumption. Energy from electron transport is dissipated as heat rather than conserved in ATP.\n\nAlternative mechanisms are inconsistent with the observations:\n- Inhibition of Complex I (A) would not increase respiration; moreover, with succinate feeding Complex II downstream of Complex I, Complex I inhibition would not cause a sustained increase and typically reduces overall flux.\n- Inhibition of ATP synthase (B) increases backpressure, elevates $\\Delta p$, and suppresses $O_2$ consumption; ADP addition would fail to stimulate respiration, opposite to the observed sustained increase.\n- Competitive inhibition of succinate transport (D) would reduce substrate availability and decrease $O_2$ consumption.\n- Inhibition of the ADP/ATP translocase (E) prevents ADP entry, abolishing ADP-stimulated respiration and not producing a sustained increase in $O_2$ consumption.\n\nTherefore, the observed rapid and sustained increase in $O_2$ consumption after Chemical X is best explained by chemical uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2061514"}]}
