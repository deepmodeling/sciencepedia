The normal proton gradient is reversed, causing the $\\text{F}_o$ subunit to rotate in the opposite direction. This forces the $\\text{F}_1$ subunit, which is now acting as an ATPase, to catalyze the hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) into Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$). The reaction is conducted in a buffer solution prepared with water that has been isotopically labeled with the heavy oxygen isotope, $^{18}$O (i.e., $H_2^{18}O$).

The heavy oxygen will be incorporated into the inorganic phosphate ($P_i$), because a water molecule acts as a nucleophile, directly attacking the phosphorus atom of the terminal (gamma) phosphate group of ATP.\nB. The heavy oxygen will be incorporated into the Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP), because a water molecule attacks the phosphorus atom of the middle (beta) phosphate group of ATP.\nC. The heavy oxygen will be incorporated into the ADP, because a water molecule displaces the terminal phosphate group by attacking the bridging oxygen atom that links the beta and gamma phosphates.\nD. The heavy oxygen will be incorporated into the $P_i$, because the terminal phosphate group first detaches from ATP as a metaphosphate intermediate and then reacts with a water molecule in the solvent.\nE. The heavy oxygen will be incorporated into the ADP, because the enzyme's catalytic site first transfers the terminal phosphate group to a specific amino acid residue, which is then hydrolyzed by a water molecule to regenerate the enzyme and release ADP.", "solution": "ATP hydrolysis by the $\\text{F}_1$ subunit acting as an ATPase is a phosphoryl transfer reaction in which a water molecule serves as the nucleophile that attacks the terminal (gamma) phosphate of ATP. The reaction coordinated by the active site (with $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ and catalytic residues) proceeds by in-line attack at the gamma phosphorus, forming a trigonal bipyramidal transition state and cleaving the $P-O$ bond between the beta and gamma phosphates.

ATP synthase is a rotary motor that couples the flow of protons to ATP synthesis, and this coupling occurs within the membrane-embedded $\\text{F}_o$ component.

[@problem_id:2286052]", "problem": "Researchers are investigating the bioenergetics of a thermophilic archaeon isolated from an acidic hot spring. The organism's ATP synthase, the enzyme responsible for synthesizing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), utilizes a proton gradient across its cell membrane. The $\\text{F}_o$ component of this synthase contains a ring of '$c$' subunits that rotates as protons move through it. In the wild-type enzyme, a specific aspartate residue (an amino acid with a carboxylate side chain) on each c-subunit is crucial for this process. A proton from the high-concentration side (periplasm) binds to the deprotonated carboxylate group of this aspartate. This binding neutralizes the charge and allows the c-ring to rotate into the hydrophobic lipid bilayer. After a nearly full rotation, the subunit is exposed to the low-concentration side (cytoplasm), where the higher pH causes the proton to dissociate, completing the transport cycle and driving the synthesis of ATP by the $\\text{F}_1$ component.\n\nThe researchers generate a mutant strain in which the gene for the $c$-subunit is altered, replacing the critical aspartate residue with an alanine residue. Alanine is a small amino acid with a neutral, nonpolar methyl group as its side chain. The mutated ATP synthase is correctly assembled and inserted into the cell membrane.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary consequence of this mutation on the function of the ATP synthase complex, assuming a normal proton gradient is maintained by the cell's respiratory chain?\n\nA. ATP synthesis will halt, but protons will flow freely and uncontrollably through the mutated $\\text{F}_o$ component, dissipating the proton gradient.\nB. Both proton translocation through the $\\text{F}_o$ component and ATP synthesis by the $\\text{F}_1$ component will be severely inhibited or completely stopped.\nC. The rate of ATP synthesis will significantly increase because the smaller alanine residue allows the c-ring to rotate more freely.\nD. Proton translocation will proceed normally, but the conformational change will no longer be coupled to ATP synthesis in the $\\text{F}_1$ component, resulting in no ATP production.\nE. The direction of the enzyme will be reversed, causing it to function exclusively as an ATP-powered proton pump, hydrolyzing ATP to pump protons out of the cytoplasm.", "solution": "In the wild-type $\\text{F}_o\\text{F}_1$-ATP synthase, proton translocation through $\\text{F}_o$ is coupled to rotation of the $c$-ring and to ATP synthesis by $\\text{F}_1$. The energetic driver is the proton motive force, an electrochemical potential difference for $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, which can be expressed symbolically as $\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$. The fundamental energetic coupling condition is that, per catalytic turnover, the work done by proton translocation equals the free energy requirement of ATP synthesis:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{H}}\\,\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} \\approx \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ATP}},\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is the number of protons translocated per ATP synthesized. Mechanical coupling implies power balance $P_{\\text{in}}=P_{\\text{out}}$, with $P_{\\text{in}}=J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ and $P_{\\text{out}}=\\tau \\omega$, where $J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ is the proton flux through $\\text{F}_o$, $\\tau$ is the torque on the rotor, and $\\omega$ is the angular velocity.\n\nProton translocation in $\\text{F}_o$ requires a protonatable carboxylate on each $c$-subunit (an aspartate or glutamate). The cycle is:\n- On the high-$\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ side, a deprotonated carboxylate $\\text{COO}^{-}$ binds $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ to form neutral $\\text{COOH}$. Charge neutralization is essential to allow burial in the hydrophobic lipid, lowering the energetic barrier for rotation.\n- Rotation carries the protonated site to the low-$\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ side, where the higher pH favors deprotonation, regenerating $\\text{COO}^{-}$ and releasing $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$.\n- This gated binding/release across two half-channels in the $a$-subunit enables net translocation of $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and drives rotation.\n\nMathematically, the capacity of $\\text{F}_o$ to carry proton flux can be represented as\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = G_{\\text{F}_o}\\,\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}},\n$$\nwhere $G_{\\text{F}_o}$ is an effective conductance that depends critically on the presence of the protonatable carboxylate; without a binding site and charge neutralization, the hydrophobic barrier prevents passage, so $G_{\\text{F}_o}\\to 0$ and thus $J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}\\to 0$ even if $\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ is maintained.\n\nIn the mutant where the essential aspartate is replaced by alanine, the $c$-subunit lacks the carboxylate side chain. Consequences follow directly:\n- There is no $\\text{COO}^-/\\text{COOH}$ group to bind and carry $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The neutral methyl side chain cannot participate in the protonation-deprotonation cycle.\n- Without proton binding and charge neutralization, the rotor cannot move a proton through the hydrophobic phase; the translocation pathway is broken. Therefore $G_{\\text{F}_o} \\approx 0$ and $J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} \\approx 0$.\n- With $J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} \\approx 0$, the input power $P_{\\text{in}}=J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} \\approx 0$, so $\\tau \\omega \\approx 0$. In steady state this implies $\\omega \\approx 0$ for the coupled rotor, so the rate of ATP synthesis by $\\text{F}_1$, which depends on rotation, is severely inhibited or stops.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A (uncontrolled proton leak) would require formation of a continuous pore. Replacing a carboxylate with a neutral alanine removes the binding site and the gating mechanism; it does not create an open channel. The expected effect is decreased, not increased, proton conductance, so A is incorrect.\n- Option B states both proton translocation and ATP synthesis are severely inhibited or stopped. This follows from $G_{\\text{F}_o}\\to 0$, giving $J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}\\to 0$ and thus no torque to drive $\\text{F}_1$, so B is correct.\n- Option C (increased ATP synthesis due to smaller residue) ignores the essential chemistry of proton binding; steric reduction cannot compensate for loss of the proton carrier, so C is incorrect.\n- Option D (normal proton translocation but uncoupled) contradicts the mechanical coupling of $\\text{F}_o$ and $\\text{F}_1$; furthermore, proton translocation itself fails without the carboxylate, so D is incorrect.\n- Option E (exclusive reversal as ATP-driven pump) requires a functional proton path through $\\text{F}_o$ to pump protons. Without the carboxylate, proton conduction in either direction is impaired, so E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is loss of proton translocation through $\\text{F}_o$ and consequent loss of ATP synthesis by $\\text{F}_1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2286052"}, {"introduction": "The rotation of the $\\text{F}_o$ motor is transmitted to the $\\text{F}_1$ catalytic head, which must then convert this mechanical energy into chemical energy.

This final practice problem challenges your understanding of this intricate coordination by exploring a scenario where the cooperative cycling is physically prevented, cementing the concept that ATP synthesis is a result of a precisely choreographed dance between the enzyme's subunits.

It consists of two main parts: the $\\text{F}_o$ portion embedded in a membrane, which transduces the energy from a proton gradient into mechanical rotation, and the $\\text{F}_1$ portion, which uses this rotation to catalyze the synthesis of ATP from Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$). The $\\text{F}_1$ headpiece is composed of three catalytic beta subunits and three non-catalytic alpha subunits arranged alternately around a central rotating gamma subunit. The rotation of the gamma subunit induces a sequence of conformational changes in the three beta subunits, cycling them through three states: Open (O), which has a low affinity for ligands and releases ATP; Loose (L), which loosely binds ADP and $P_i$; and Tight (T), which has a high affinity for substrates and catalytically converts them to ATP. At any given instant, each of the three beta subunits is in a different one of these three states.\n\nImagine a hypothetical scenario where a novel neurotoxin specifically targets the $\\text{F}_1$ portion of mitochondrial ATP synthase. This toxin acts by forming a permanent, rigid covalent cross-link between two of the three beta subunits, forcing them to maintain the exact same conformational state relative to each other at all times.\n\nGiven this specific molecular modification, which of the following outcomes is the most direct and immediate consequence for the function of the affected ATP synthase complex?\n\nA. ATP synthesis ceases entirely because the cooperative, sequential conformational changes required for the binding change mechanism are prevented.\nB. The rate of ATP synthesis is reduced to one-third of its normal value, as only the single non-cross-linked catalytic site remains functional.\nC. The rate of ATP synthesis is reduced to two-thirds of its normal value, as the two cross-linked subunits function in unison as a single, albeit less efficient, catalytic unit.\nD. The complex reverses its function, leading to continuous ATP hydrolysis that actively pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space.\nE. Proton translocation through the $\\text{F}_o$ subunit becomes uncoupled from the catalytic activity of the $\\text{F}_1$ headpiece, resulting in futile dissipation of the proton-motive force as heat.", "solution": "The binding change mechanism of the $\\text{F}_1$ portion requires that the three catalytic beta subunits occupy distinct conformational states $O$, $L$, and $T$ simultaneously. The central gamma subunit is asymmetric and imposes different conformations on each beta subunit as it rotates; a rotation by $2\\pi/3$ radians advances each beta subunit to the next state in the cycle $O \\rightarrow L \\rightarrow T \\rightarrow O$, yielding cooperative catalysis whereby substrate binding, catalysis, and product release occur in a coordinated sequence across the three sites.\n\nThis mechanism relies on two indispensable features:\n- Asymmetry: at any instant, the three beta subunits must be in three different conformations ($O$, $L$, $T$).\n- Sequential interconversion: mechanical rotation of the gamma subunit induces a staggered, phase-shifted progression of states across the three beta subunits.\n\nIf a toxin covalently cross-links two beta subunits so they must maintain the same conformational state at all times, both features are violated:\n1. The requirement that the three sites be simultaneously in $O$, $L$, and $T$ cannot be satisfied if two subunits are constrained to be identical. This eliminates the necessary threefold asymmetry.\n2. The gamma-induced sequential progression cannot be executed, because the gamma subunit cannot simultaneously drive two beta subunits into distinct, phase-shifted conformations if they are rigidly constrained to be identical. The mechanical cycle is thus frustrated.\n\nAs a direct mechanical consequence, rotation of the gamma subunit is stalled by the $\\text{F}_1$ headpiece, preventing the conformational cycling required for catalysis. Because $\\text{F}_o$ rotation and proton translocation are tightly coupled to $\\text{F}_1$ rotation, stalling of $\\text{F}_1$ prevents $\\text{F}_o$ rotation and thus does not produce uncoupled proton leak; instead, the enzyme ceases to synthesize ATP. It also does not simply reduce to one-third or two-thirds activity, since the cooperative, sequential mechanism cannot operate with two sites forced to be identical; nor does it reverse to ATP hydrolysis for the same reason.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate outcome is complete cessation of ATP synthesis due to disruption of the binding change mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2286060"}]}
