This practice treats the Calvin cycle like a biochemical factory, challenging you to track the precise stoichiometry of raw materials ($CO_2$) and energy currencies (ATP and NADPH) required to produce the building blocks for a single molecule of glucose. Mastering this carbon and energy bookkeeping is the first step to truly appreciating the cycle's efficiency and elegance [@problem_id:2317360].", "problem": "A plant cell is performing photosynthesis to build carbohydrates. The key biosynthetic product of the Calvin cycle is the three-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). This G3P is then exported from the chloroplast to be used in the synthesis of larger sugars, such as glucose (a six-carbon sugar), in the cytoplasm.\n\nThe Calvin cycle proceeds in three key stages:\n1.  **Carbon Fixation**: One molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2) is attached to one molecule of the five-carbon acceptor, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), forming an unstable six-carbon intermediate that immediately splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). This process constitutes one \"turn\" of the cycle.\n2.  **Reduction**: Each molecule of 3-PGA is converted to G3P. This conversion consumes one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and one molecule of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) per 3-PGA molecule.\n3.  **Regeneration**: For the cycle to be sustained, the initial RuBP must be regenerated from G3P. To produce one net G3P molecule available for export, the cycle must operate such that a total of six G3P molecules are formed in the reduction stage. Five of these G3P molecules are then recycled to regenerate three molecules of RuBP, a process that consumes a total of three ATP molecules.\n\nYour task is to determine the total molecular resources consumed by the Calvin cycle to produce the net amount of G3P required for the synthesis of a single molecule of glucose. It is known that two molecules of G3P are required to synthesize one molecule of glucose.\n\nCalculate the total number of CO2 molecules that must be fixed, the total number of ATP molecules consumed, and the total number of NADPH molecules consumed. Express your final answer as a set of three integers in the order: (number of CO2 molecules, number of ATP molecules, number of NADPH molecules).", "solution": "The Calvin cycle stoichiometry per the given rules is derived as follows.\n\nOne \"turn\" fixes one molecule of CO2 by combining it with one molecule of RuBP to yield two molecules of 3-PGA. Therefore, after three turns, a total of $3$ molecules of CO2 are fixed and $6$ molecules of 3-PGA are produced:\n$$3\\,CO_2 \\longrightarrow 6\\,\\text{3-PGA}.$$\n\nIn the reduction stage, each 3-PGA is converted to G3P using one ATP and one NADPH. Thus, converting $6$ molecules of 3-PGA to $6$ molecules of G3P consumes:\n$$\\text{ATP}_{\\text{reduction}}=6,\\quad \\text{NADPH}_{\\text{reduction}}=6.$$\n\nTo sustain the cycle, five of the six G3P are used to regenerate three RuBP, consuming a total of three ATP:\n$$\\text{ATP}_{\\text{regeneration}}=3.$$\n\nHence, for one net G3P exported (with three CO2 fixed), the total energy and reducing equivalents consumed are:\n$$\\text{CO}_2\\ \\text{per net G3P}=3,$$\n$$\\text{ATP}\\ \\text{per net G3P}=6+3=9,$$\n$$\\text{NADPH}\\ \\text{per net G3P}=6.$$\n\nGlucose synthesis requires two G3P.
