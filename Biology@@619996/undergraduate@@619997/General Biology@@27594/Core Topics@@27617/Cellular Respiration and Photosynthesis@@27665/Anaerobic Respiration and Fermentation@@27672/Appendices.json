Glycolysis can be divided into two phases: the energy investment phase and the energy payoff phase.\n\n**Energy Investment Phase:**\nIn the initial steps of glycolysis, the cell invests $\\text{ATP}$ to activate the glucose molecule.\n1.

The subsequent reactions occur twice for each initial glucose molecule.\n1.  The conversion of two molecules of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate, catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase, generates two molecules of $\\text{ATP}$ via substrate-level phosphorylation.\n    $$ 2 \\times (\\text{1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate} + \\text{ADP}) \\rightarrow 2 \\times (\\text{3-Phosphoglycerate} + \\text{ATP}) $$\n    This yields a gross gain of 2 $\\text{ATP}$.\n2.

As soon as the $\\text{NAD}^{+}$ pool falls below the level required by GAPDH, the glycolytic pathway stalls at that step. Because pyruvate production lies downstream of GAPDH, pyruvate will not accumulate; instead, glycolytic flux collapses due to redox imbalance.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and critical consequence upon the shift to anaerobic conditions in this pyruvate decarboxylase-null yeast is cessation of glycolysis due to rapid depletion of the cellular $\\text{NAD}^{+}$ pool, which corresponds to option C.
