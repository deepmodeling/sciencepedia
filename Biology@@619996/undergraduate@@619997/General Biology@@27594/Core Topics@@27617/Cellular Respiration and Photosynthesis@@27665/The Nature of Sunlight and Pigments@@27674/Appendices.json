This first exercise allows you to practice interpreting raw experimental data from a spectrophotometer, a workhorse instrument in any biochemistry lab. By analyzing a pigment's absorption spectrum, you will deduce its perceived color, reinforcing the key principle that the color of a substance is determined by the wavelengths of light it transmits and reflects, not the ones it absorbs.

To begin characterizing its properties, a researcher prepares a solution of the purified pigment and analyzes it using a spectrophotometer, an instrument that measures how much light a substance absorbs at different wavelengths. The experiment is conducted using a cuvette with a path length of 1 cm, and the results for absorbance across the visible spectrum are recorded.\n\nThe data from the spectrophotometer are as follows:\n\n| Wavelength (nm) | Region of Visible Spectrum | Absorbance (unitless) |\n|:---------------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|\n| 430             | Violet                     | 0.15                  |\n| 470             | Blue                       | 0.05                  |\n| 520             | Green                      | 0.10                  |\n| 580             | Yellow                     | 0.50                  |\n| 610             | Orange                     | 0.95                  |\n| 660             | Red                        | 0.70                  |\n\nBased on this absorption spectrum data, what is the apparent color of the maricyanin solution when it is illuminated by white light?\n\nA.

[@problem_id:2321610]", "problem": "An undergraduate biology student is conducting an experiment to investigate the photosynthetic activity of an aquatic plant, *Elodea*. The student places two identical sprigs of *Elodea* into separate beakers filled with a bicarbonate solution, which provides a source of carbon dioxide. Each setup is illuminated with a light source of equal intensity. However, one setup is covered with a filter that transmits only blue light (wavelength approximately 470 nm), while the other is covered with a filter that transmits only green light (wavelength approximately 540 nm). The student observes that the plant under the blue light filter produces a significantly greater volume of gas bubbles over a 30-minute period compared to the plant under the green light filter.\n\nAssuming that the gas bubbles are primarily oxygen produced during photosynthesis, which of the following statements provides the most direct and accurate conclusion about the photosynthetic pigments in *Elodea* based on this observation?\n\nA. The photosynthetic pigments in *Elodea* are most efficient at absorbing green light and reflecting blue light.\n\nB. The photosynthetic pigments in *Elodea* primarily reflect all wavelengths of visible light, but use chemical energy to photosynthesize.\n\nC. The energy per photon of green light is higher than that of blue light, causing photoinhibition and reducing the photosynthetic rate.\n\nD. The photosynthetic pigments in *Elodea* absorb blue light more effectively than green light, using the absorbed energy to drive photosynthesis.\n\nE. *Elodea* must use a unique pigment, different from chlorophyll, that has a specialized absorption peak in the blue region of the spectrum.", "solution": "The observation: under equal light intensity and identical carbon source, the Elodea under the blue filter produces more oxygen bubbles than under the green filter over the same time. Oxygen bubbles in this setup are a proxy for the rate of the light-dependent reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis; thus, a higher bubble rate indicates a higher photosynthetic rate.\n\nPhysical principle relating photon energy to wavelength:\n$$\nE = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda},\n$$\nwhere $E$ is energy per photon, $h$ is Planck’s constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength. Since $\\lambda_{\\text{blue}}<\\lambda_{\\text{green}}$, it follows that $E_{\\text{blue}}>E_{\\text{green}}$.\n\nFor equal light intensity $I$ (power per unit area), the incident photon flux $\\Phi$ (photons per unit area per unit time) satisfies\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{I}{E} = \\frac{I\\lambda}{hc}.\n$$\nTherefore, with equal $I$, we have $\\Phi_{\\text{blue}}<\\Phi_{\\text{green}}$, because $\\lambda_{\\text{blue}}<\\lambda_{\\text{green}}$.\n\nDespite the lower photon flux under blue light, the plant exhibits a higher photosynthetic rate under blue light than under green light. This implies that the photosynthetic apparatus absorbs and utilizes blue photons more effectively than green photons. This is consistent with the known absorption spectra of chlorophylls and accessory pigments in green plants: they absorb strongly in the blue and red regions and weakly in the green region (which is largely reflected/transmitted, giving plants their green appearance).\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\n- A claims maximal absorption of green and reflection of blue. This contradicts both the observation (lower photosynthesis under green) and the known absorption spectra of chlorophylls. Reject A.\n\n- B claims pigments reflect all visible wavelengths and rely on chemical energy. This is incompatible with the requirement that light energy must be absorbed to drive the light reactions of photosynthesis. Reject B.\n\n- C claims green photons have higher energy than blue, causing photoinhibition. From $E=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, this is false; blue photons have higher energy. Moreover, the data do not show photoinhibition under blue compared to green. Reject C.\n\n- D states that the pigments absorb blue light more effectively than green light and use the absorbed energy to drive photosynthesis. This directly explains the observed higher oxygen evolution under blue than green and aligns with established pigment absorption properties. Accept D.\n\n- E posits a unique pigment different from chlorophyll with a specialized blue peak. The observation is fully explained by the standard chlorophyll a and b absorption in the blue; no unique pigment is required. Reject E.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and accurate conclusion is that the photosynthetic pigments in Elodea absorb blue light more effectively than green light and use that absorbed energy to drive photosynthesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2321610"}, {"introduction": "The laws of physics and the principles of natural selection are universal, allowing us to generate fascinating hypotheses about life on other worlds. This final challenge asks you to act as an astrobiologist, applying everything you’ve learned about pigments and photosynthesis to a novel evolutionary scenario. By reasoning from first principles about the available light and the drive for energy capture efficiency, you can predict how life might adapt on a planet orbiting a star very different from our own. [@problem_id:2321574]", "problem": "Imagine astronomers discover an Earth-like exoplanet, named Tethys, orbiting a stable M-dwarf star. The light from this star that reaches the planet's surface is significantly different from our sun's. Its emission spectrum is heavily concentrated in the red portion of the visible spectrum (approximately 620-750 nanometers), with a much lower intensity in the green portion (500-570 nm), and a negligible amount of energy emitted in the blue and violet portions (400-500 nm).\n\nOn Tethys, complex, multicellular, plant-like autotrophs have evolved. These organisms perform photosynthesis, a process that relies on pigments to capture light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic compounds. Assume that the fundamental biophysical principles of light absorption and reflection by pigment molecules are universal, and that natural selection on Tethys would favor the evolution of pigments that maximize the efficiency of energy capture from the available starlight.\n\nIf a botanist were to take a sample of a typical leaf from Tethys and observe it back on Earth under a broad-spectrum white light source (like our sun), which of the following colors would the leaf most likely appear to be?\n\nA. Red\n\nB. Green\n\nC. Black\n\nD. Blue or Cyan\n\nE.

The reflected component is $R(\\lambda)=1-A(\\lambda)$, ignoring transmission for simplicity. The net rate of usable photon energy captured is proportional to the spectral overlap integral\n$$\n\\int_{400}^{750} A(\\lambda)\\,I(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda.\n$$\nNatural selection that maximizes photosynthetic energy capture will favor pigments that increase this integral.\n\nOn Tethys, the M-dwarf delivers $I_{T}(\\lambda)$ that is large in the red band $\\lambda \\in [620,750]\\ \\mathrm{nm}$, lower in the green band $\\lambda \\in [500,570]\\ \\mathrm{nm}$, and negligible in the blue-violet band $\\lambda \\in [400,500]\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. Therefore, increasing $A(\\lambda)$ in the red yields a large increase in $\\int A(\\lambda)\\,I_{T}(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda$; increasing $A(\\lambda)$ in the green yields a smaller increase; increasing $A(\\lambda)$ in the blue yields essentially no increase because $I_{T}(\\lambda)\\approx 0$ there. Consequently, selection strongly favors high $A(\\lambda)$ in the red, may favor some increase in the green, and exerts essentially no positive selection to increase $A(\\lambda)$ in the blue-violet. Moreover, because synthesizing and maintaining pigments carries costs, there is no selective pressure to evolve strong blue absorption if it does not improve energy capture under Tethys’ spectrum.\n\nNow consider how the leaf appears under a broad-spectrum Earth-like white light source with irradiance $I_{E}(\\lambda)$ that has substantial intensity across blue, green, and red. The perceived color is determined by which wavelengths are predominantly reflected, i.e., where $R(\\lambda)=1-A(\\lambda)$ is largest. Given the adaptive outcome above, we expect:\n- $A(\\lambda)$ high in the red to harvest the dominant available energy on Tethys, hence $R(\\lambda)$ low in red (little red reflected).\n- $A(\\lambda)$ possibly moderate in the green (depending on evolved accessory pigments), hence $R(\\lambda)$ not maximal in green.\n- $A(\\lambda)$ low in the blue-violet due to negligible selection pressure on Tethys, hence $R(\\lambda)$ high in blue-violet (those wavelengths are not absorbed and are thus reflected or scattered).\n\nUnder white illumination, the leaf will therefore preferentially reflect shorter visible wavelengths it does not absorb—appearing blue or cyan to a human observer.\n\nThis reasoning rules out the other options:\n- Red (A) would require reflecting red, which contradicts selection to absorb the dominant red energy on Tethys.\n- Green (B) would require reflecting green broadly; while some green might be reflected, maximizing capture would favor absorbing what green is available rather than reflecting it.\n- Black (C) would require broad strong absorption across blue, green, and red. With $I_{T}(\\lambda)\\approx 0$ in the blue, there is no selective driver to evolve strong blue absorption, so black is not the most likely outcome under the stated assumptions.\n- White (E) would imply reflecting most wavelengths and is opposite to maximizing absorption.\n\nHence, the most likely observed color under Earth’s white light is blue or cyan.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2321574"}]}
