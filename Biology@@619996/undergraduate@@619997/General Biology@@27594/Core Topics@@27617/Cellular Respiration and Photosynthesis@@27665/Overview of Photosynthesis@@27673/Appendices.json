In essence, $CO_2$ is reduced to carbohydrate, retaining oxygen atoms in the product $C_6H_{12}O_6$, while water serves as the electron and proton source and contributes the oxygen that is released as $O_2$.\n\nApply isotopic tracing to each experiment:\n\nExperiment I: Medium has $H_2^{18}O$ and supplied gas is $C^{16}O_2$.\n- From the photolysis step, the evolved $O_2$ will contain the heavy isotope because its oxygen atoms come from $H_2^{18}O$. Therefore, $^{18}O$ appears in $O_2$.\n- The glucose formed incorporates carbon and oxygen from $CO_2$; since the $CO_2$ contains $^{16}O$, the oxygen in $C_6H_{12}O_6$ will be $^{16}O$, not $^{18}O$.\n\nExperiment II: Medium has $H_2^{16}O$ and supplied gas is $C^{18}O_2$.\n- The evolved $O_2$ derives from $H_2O$, which here is $H_2^{16}O$, so $O_2$ will contain $^{16}O$, not $^{18}O$.\n- The glucose oxygen atoms are derived from $CO_2$; because the $CO_2$ is $C^{18}O_2$, $^{18}O$ will be incorporated into $C_6H_{12}O_6$.\n\nTherefore, in Experiment I, $^{18}O$ is found in $O_2$; in Experiment II, $^{18}O$ is found in $C_6H_{12}O_6$, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2328734"}, {"introduction": "Photosynthesis consists of two interconnected stages: the light-dependent reactions, which generate ATP and NADPH, and the Calvin cycle, which uses these energy carriers to fix $CO_2$.

This advanced problem challenges you to move beyond the idealized model of photosynthesis and calculate the true energetic cost, in terms of ATP and NADPH, required to produce one molecule of glucose under conditions where photorespiration is actively occurring ([@problem_id:2306608]). Successfully solving this requires careful stoichiometric bookkeeping and integrates your knowledge of both the Calvin cycle and the photorespiratory pathway, reflecting a more realistic biochemical scenario.", "problem": "In a typical C3 plant, the enzyme Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate Carboxylase/Oxygenase (RuBisCO) can catalyze both the carboxylation of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to initiate the Calvin cycle and the oxygenation of RuBP to initiate the energetically costly process of photorespiration.\n\nConsider a C3 plant photosynthesizing under conditions where the rate of RuBisCO's oxygenase activity is significant. For every two carboxylation reactions (fixation of $CO_2$), one oxygenation reaction (fixation of $O_2$) occurs. The net synthesis of one molecule of glucose requires the net fixation of six molecules of $CO_2$.\n\nTo solve this problem, use the following established stoichiometry for the key processes:\n1.  **Calvin Cycle - Reduction:** The conversion of one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) to one molecule of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) consumes one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and one molecule of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH).\n2.  **Calvin Cycle - Regeneration:** The regeneration of one molecule of RuBP from G3P molecules consumes one molecule of ATP.\n3.  **Photorespiratory Salvage:** The complete salvage process for the products of oxygenation is complex. For every two molecules of a two-carbon compound, 2-phosphoglycolate, that are generated from two separate oxygenation events, the salvage pathway consumes a total of one molecule of ATP and one molecule of NADPH to produce one molecule of 3-PGA, while also releasing one molecule of $CO_2$.\n\nDetermine the total number of ATP molecules and the total number of NADPH molecules required to produce one molecule of glucose under these specific photorespiratory conditions.

The photorespiratory salvage pathway releases one molecule of $CO_2$ per two oxygenations, so the total $CO_2$ released by photorespiration is\n$$\\frac{O}{2}=\\frac{C}{4}$$\nHence the net fixed $CO_2$ is\n$$C-\\frac{C}{4}=\\frac{3C}{4}$$\nFor one molecule of glucose, net fixation must be $6$, so\n$$\\frac{3C}{4}=6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad C=8, \\quad O=4$$\n\nAccount for 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) production:\n- Each carboxylation produces two 3-PGA, giving $2C=16$ 3-PGA from carboxylation.\n- Each oxygenation produces one 3-PGA and one 2-phosphoglycolate; thus $O=4$ oxygenations yield $4$ 3-PGA and $4$ 2-phosphoglycolate.\n- The salvage pathway converts every two 2-phosphoglycolate into one 3-PGA while releasing one $CO_2$, consuming one ATP and one NADPH. With $4$ 2-phosphoglycolate, salvage yields $2$ additional 3-PGA, releases $2$ $CO_2$, and consumes $2$ ATP and $2$ NADPH.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 3-PGA molecules formed is\n$$16 + 4 + 2 = 22$$\n\nApply the given energetic costs:\n1) Calvin cycle reduction: converting each 3-PGA to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) costs $1$ ATP and $1$ NADPH. For $22$ 3-PGA, this requires 22 ATP and 22 NADPH.\n\n2) Calvin cycle regeneration: regenerating one RuBP from G3P costs $1$ ATP. The total number of RuBP molecules that must be regenerated equals the total number of RuBisCO turnovers, $C+O=8+4=12$, hence this requires 12 ATP.\n\n3) Photorespiratory salvage: as above, the $4$ oxygenations (two pairs) consume 2 ATP and 2 NADPH.\n\nSumming all costs gives the totals:\n$$ \\text{ATP: } 22 + 12 + 2 = 36, \\qquad \\text{NADPH: } 22 + 2 = 24 $$\n\nA carbon check confirms consistency: after reduction, there are $22$ G3P (total of $66$ carbons).
