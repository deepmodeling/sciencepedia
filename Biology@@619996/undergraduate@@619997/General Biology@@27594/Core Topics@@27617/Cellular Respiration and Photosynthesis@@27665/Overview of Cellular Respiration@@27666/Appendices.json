The cells are provided with all necessary nutrients, including glucose. Two separate experiments are conducted using isotopic labeling to trace the path of oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Experiment 1**: The cells are cultured in a medium containing water labeled with a heavy oxygen isotope ($H_2^{18}O$). The glucose provided is normal, and the cells respire using atmospheric oxygen, which is predominantly the common isotope ($^{16}O_2$).\n*   **Experiment 2**: The cells are cultured in a medium with normal water ($H_2^{16}O$) and normal glucose. However, they are supplied with a sealed atmosphere containing oxygen gas exclusively composed of the heavy isotope ($^{18}O_2$).\n\nAssuming that cellular respiration proceeds to completion in both experiments, in which final or intermediate molecules would the heavy oxygen isotope ($^{18}O$) be primarily detected for each experiment?\n\nA.

Atmospheric $O_{2}$ is unlabeled and is reduced to unlabeled $H_{2}^{16}O$ at complex IV, so the distinctive site to detect $^{18}O$ from the tracer is $CO_{2}$, i.e., primarily labeled carbon dioxide ($C^{18}O_{2}$, acknowledging possible mixed isotopologues).\n\n- Experiment 2 ($H_{2}^{16}O$ in the medium; $^{18}O_{2}$ supplied): The labeled molecular oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor and is reduced to water, so the $^{18}O$ label appears in the product water as $H_{2}^{18}O$.\n\nTherefore, the correct pairing is: Experiment 1 gives labeled carbon dioxide; Experiment 2 gives labeled water, which corresponds to option C.\n\nRuling out other options:\n- A is incorrect because $O_{2}$ is consumed, not produced, in respiration.\n- B is incorrect because glucose is catabolized and not newly synthesized or labeled from water oxygen in respiration.\n- D swaps the correct destinations of the labels.\n- E is incorrect because ATP is not the principal sink of the oxygen isotopic label in these conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2306168"}, {"introduction": "The generation of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation is a marvel of biological engineering, but its efficiency hinges on the tight coupling between two distinct processes: electron transport and ATP synthesis. This practice explores the critical nature of this coupling by introducing a hypothetical \"uncoupling\" agent that disrupts the vital link between them [@problem_id:2306157]. By predicting the consequences of creating a \"leak\" for protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the proton-motive force as the central energetic currency that connects the oxidation of fuel to the synthesis of ATP.", "problem": "An experiment is conducted using a suspension of isolated, functional mitochondria placed in a buffered solution. The solution is saturated with oxygen and contains an abundance of ADP, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and pyruvate. The initial rates of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and oxygen consumption are measured. Subsequently, a synthetic chemical agent called \"uncouplin\" is introduced into the suspension. The uncouplin molecule inserts itself into the inner mitochondrial membrane, forming a stable, open channel that is highly permeable to protons ($H^+$). Assuming the substrates (pyruvate, ADP, Pi, O$_2$) remain non-limiting, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate effects on the rates of ATP synthesis and oxygen consumption after the addition of uncouplin?\n\nA. The rate of ATP synthesis decreases, and the rate of oxygen consumption decreases.\n\nB. The rate of ATP synthesis decreases, and the rate of oxygen consumption increases.\n\nC. The rate of ATP synthesis increases, and the rate of oxygen consumption increases.\n\nD. The rate of ATP synthesis increases, and the rate of oxygen consumption decreases.\n\nE.

The proton motive force is\n$$\n\\Delta p=\\Delta \\psi-\\frac{RT}{F}\\Delta\\mathrm{pH},\n$$\nwhich is generated when the electron transport chain (ETC) pumps protons out of the matrix. ATP synthase uses this electrochemical gradient to drive phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. The thermodynamic driving condition for net ATP synthesis is\n$$\nnF\\Delta p>\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{\\prime},\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of protons translocated per ATP synthesized.\n\nLet $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(\\Delta p)$ be the proton pumping flux produced by the ETC, $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(\\Delta p)$ the proton flux through ATP synthase coupled to ATP production, and $J_{\\mathrm{leak}}=g_{\\mathrm{H}}\\Delta p$ the passive proton leak, with $g_{\\mathrm{H}}$ the effective proton conductance of the inner membrane.

The oxygen consumption rate $v_{O_{2}}$ is proportional to the electron flux through the ETC, which is proportional to $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$ via the proton pumping stoichiometry; symbolically,\n$$\nv_{O_{2}}\\propto J_{\\mathrm{ETC}}\\propto J_{\\mathrm{pump}}.\n$$\n\nAfter addition of uncouplin, which forms an open proton channel, the effective proton conductance $g_{\\mathrm{H}}$ increases sharply. From the steady-state relation, a large increase in $g_{\\mathrm{H}}$ forces $\\Delta p$ to collapse toward zero to satisfy the equality. As $\\Delta p\\to 0$, the driving force for ATP synthesis vanishes, so\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(\\Delta p)\\to 0,\n$$\nand net ATP synthesis rate drops markedly. At the same time, removal of the backpressure from $\\Delta p$ allows the ETC to run closer to its maximal catalytic rate (substrates remain non-limiting), so $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$ and therefore $v_{O_{2}}$ increase. Equivalently, the P/O ratio falls toward zero, while oxygen consumption increases because electron transport is no longer constrained by the proton gradient.\n\nThus, upon uncoupling with non-limiting substrates, the immediate effects are a decrease in ATP synthesis rate and an increase in oxygen consumption rate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2306157"}, {"introduction": "Textbooks often provide standard yields for ATP production, such as ~2.5 ATP per NADH.
