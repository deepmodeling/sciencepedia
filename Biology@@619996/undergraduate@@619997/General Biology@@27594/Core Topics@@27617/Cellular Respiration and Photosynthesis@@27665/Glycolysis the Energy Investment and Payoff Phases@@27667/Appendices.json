Thus, for one glucose, ATP consumed is 2 and $NADH$ produced is 0. Aldolase then yields two triose phosphates (one glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, G3P, and one dihydroxyacetone phosphate, DHAP), and triose phosphate isomerase converts DHAP to a second G3P. Therefore, the payoff phase operates on two G3P per glucose.\n\nSecond, in the energy payoff phase, consider the yield per G3P:\n- G3P dehydrogenase: produces 1 $NADH$ per G3P.\n- Phosphoglycerate kinase: produces 1 ATP per G3P.\n- Pyruvate kinase: produces 1 ATP per G3P.\nHence, per G3P the net is 2 ATP and 1 $NADH$. For two G3P, the payoff totals are 4 ATP and 2 $NADH$.\n\nScenario A (start with one glucose): Total ATP produced is 4, ATP consumed is 2, so net ATP is $4-2=2$. Net $NADH$ is 2 (all from the payoff phase). Therefore, Scenario A yields 2 ATP and 2 $NADH$.\n\nScenario B (start with two G3P): There is no prior ATP investment; only the payoff phase occurs. For two G3P, ATP produced is 4 and $NADH$ produced is 2. Therefore, Scenario B yields 4 ATP and 2 $NADH$.\n\nCollecting the four required integers in order:\n1. Scenario A net ATP: 2.\n2.

Arsenate acts as an alternative substrate for the enzyme Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which normally catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. In the presence of arsenate, GAPDH instead produces 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate.
