This practice problem [@problem_id:2301134] explores the direct consequences of enzyme deficiency by presenting a thought experiment where cells lack glycosidases, the enzymes that break down carbohydrates. By predicting the outcome, you will gain insight into the molecular mechanism behind devastating human genetic disorders known as lysosomal storage diseases.", "problem": "Imagine a researcher develops a new line of cultured mammalian cells. Through genetic engineering, the lysosomes within these cells are altered. While they retain a full complement of functional proteases (for digesting proteins) and lipases (for digesting lipids), they have completely lost the ability to produce any glycosidases, which are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in complex carbohydrates. These cells are grown in a standard culture medium containing all necessary nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most direct and immediate consequence of this specific enzymatic deficiency for the cells?\n\nA. The cells will be unable to break down proteins obtained through endocytosis, leading to an accumulation of protein aggregates.\n\nB. The lysosomes will swell due to an accumulation of undigested lipid droplets, impairing their function.\n\nC. The cells will exhibit an abnormal buildup of polysaccharides and glycolipids within their lysosomes.\n\nD. The rate of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) synthesis will immediately decrease due to the inability to process glucose from the medium.\n\nE. The cells will be unable to synthesize new proteins because the amino acid pool from lysosomal recycling is depleted.", "solution": "We analyze the functional consequences of selectively abolishing lysosomal glycosidases while preserving lysosomal proteases and lipases.\n\nLysosomes are responsible for degrading macromolecules delivered via endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy. Degradation requires specific hydrolases: proteases for proteins, lipases for lipids, and glycosidases for carbohydrate moieties, including the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids, and complex polysaccharides such as glycosaminoglycans. If glycosidases are absent, the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins and glycolipids, as well as lysosome-directed polysaccharides, cannot be hydrolyzed. This leads to the progressive storage of undigested carbohydrate-rich material within lysosomes, a hallmark of lysosomal storage disorders affecting glycosidases (e.g., mucopolysaccharidoses and certain gangliosidoses).\n\nOption-by-option evaluation:\n- A is incorrect because proteases are intact, so lysosomal degradation of the protein components of endocytosed cargo can proceed; there is no primary block in protein catabolism.\n- B is incorrect because lipases are intact, so neutral lipids and the lipid portions of cargo can be hydrolyzed. Although glycolipids contain lipid moieties, their carbohydrate headgroups require glycosidases; failure to remove sugars leads to accumulation of glycolipids as carbohydrate-decorated species in lysosomes, not simple lipid droplet accumulation due to failed lipolysis.\n- C is correct because the immediate and direct effect of lacking glycosidases is impaired degradation of carbohydrate-rich substrates, causing lysosomal accumulation of polysaccharides (e.g., glycosaminoglycans) and glycolipids (due to undegraded sugar headgroups).\n- D is incorrect because glucose uptake and metabolism via glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation occur in the cytosol and mitochondria, independent of lysosomal glycosidases. With glucose present in the medium, ATP synthesis does not immediately decrease due to this specific lysosomal defect.\n- E is incorrect because proteases are functional and the medium supplies amino acids; lysosomal recycling of amino acids is not abolished, so protein synthesis is not acutely impaired.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is the lysosomal accumulation of carbohydrate-rich substrates, specifically polysaccharides and glycolipids.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2301134"}, {"introduction": "The powerful digestive ability of lysosomes depends on their highly acidic internal environment, maintained at a pH of approximately $4.5$. This exercise [@problem_id:2301153] demonstrates how this essential chemical property can be a vulnerability, as some viruses have evolved to exploit the low pH to invade cells. You are challenged to identify a pharmacological strategy to neutralize this threat, reinforcing the connection between organelle chemistry and therapeutic intervention.", "problem": "A team of virologists is studying a newly discovered enveloped virus, designated \"Lysovir-1,\" which preferentially infects human macrophages. Their research reveals that the virus enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis, becoming enclosed within an endosome. The crucial step for infection occurs when this endosome fuses with a lysosome. The highly acidic environment of the resulting endolysosome, with a pH of approximately 4.5, is essential. This low pH induces a conformational change in a viral fusion protein, allowing the viral envelope to fuse with the endolysosomal membrane and release the viral genetic material into the host cell's cytoplasm.\n\nAs a member of the research team, you are tasked with identifying the most effective therapeutic strategy to specifically block this pH-dependent uncoating step of the Lysovir-1 replication cycle. Below is a list of candidate experimental drugs with their known mechanisms of action. Which drug would be the most direct and specific inhibitor for this process?\n\nA. **Actinomycin-B:** A compound that binds to microtubules and prevents their polymerization, thereby disrupting intracellular transport along these cytoskeletal tracks.\n\nB. **Receptin-MIMIC:** A soluble, synthetic peptide designed to mimic the host cell receptor, effectively binding to Lysovir-1 virions in the extracellular space before they can attach to a cell.\n\nC. **Alkalone-4:** A lipophilic weak base that freely diffuses across biological membranes in its neutral state. In acidic compartments like lysosomes, it becomes protonated, which traps it inside and causes a significant increase in the organelle's internal pH.\n\nD. **Synthase-STOP:** A potent inhibitor of the host cell's ribosomal machinery, halting all cellular protein synthesis.\n\nE. **Protease Inhibitor Z:** A small molecule that specifically and irreversibly binds to the active site of the viral protease required for processing new viral proteins late in the replication cycle.", "solution": "The step to be inhibited is the pH-dependent uncoating that requires an acidic endolysosomal environment. Acidic pH triggers a conformational change in the viral fusion protein that enables the viral envelope to fuse with the endolysosomal membrane, releasing the genome into the cytoplasm. Therefore, the most direct and specific way to block this step is to prevent endosomal/lysosomal acidification so that the fusion protein never reaches the low pH threshold needed for activation.\n\nA lipophilic weak base that accumulates in acidic compartments does exactly this via ion trapping and buffering. For a weak base $B$ in equilibrium $BH^{+} \\rightleftharpoons B + H^{+}$, the Henderson–Hasselbalch relationship\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[B]}{[BH^{+}]}\\right)\n$$\nshows that when $\\mathrm{pH} < \\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, the protonated form $BH^{+}$ predominates, causing the base to become trapped in the acidic lumen. This sequestration consumes protons and buffers the compartment, raising its $\\mathrm{pH}$ and thereby preventing the low-pH-triggered conformational change of the viral fusion protein. As a result, envelope–endolysosome fusion and genome release are blocked directly at the pH-dependent uncoating step.\n\nApplying this to the options:\n- Option C (Alkalone-4) is a lipophilic weak base that diffuses across membranes, becomes protonated and trapped in lysosomes, and raises their internal $\\mathrm{pH}$. This directly and specifically inhibits the pH-dependent uncoating step.\n- Option A disrupts microtubule-dependent transport but does not specifically target the acid-triggered fusion process.\n- Option B blocks attachment in the extracellular phase, not the endolysosomal pH step.\n- Option D globally halts host translation, which is nonspecific and does not target uncoating.\n- Option E targets a late proteolytic processing step, not the pH-dependent entry/uncoating step.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and specific inhibitor of the described process is Alkalone-4.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2301153"}, {"introduction": "Challenging the classic view of lysosomes as mere disposal units, this problem reveals their surprising and dynamic role as cellular first responders. When the plasma membrane is physically damaged, lysosomes are rapidly deployed to the injury site to perform a critical repair function. This exercise [@problem_id:2301162] asks you to analyze this emergency response, highlighting the lysosome's adaptability and its crucial role in maintaining cell integrity and survival.", "problem": "A cell biology research group is investigating the mechanisms of plasma membrane repair in cultured human fibroblasts. By using a fine-tipped glass micropipette, they create a small, localized puncture in the plasma membrane of a single fibroblast. The cell is maintained in a culture medium containing a physiologically high concentration of extracellular calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). Within seconds of the injury, fluorescence microscopy reveals that lysosomes, pre-labeled with a fluorescent marker, rapidly translocate from the perinuclear region to the site of the puncture and fuse with the plasma membrane, a process known as lysosomal exocytosis.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and comprehensive explanation for the functional significance of this observed lysosomal response?\n\nA. The primary function is to release hydrolytic enzymes into the extracellular space to signal to neighboring cells that an injury has occurred, thereby recruiting immune cells and initiating a localized inflammatory response.\n\nB. This event triggers a specialized form of apoptosis, where the lysosomes fuse at the periphery to ensure the controlled self-destruction of the compromised cell, preventing it from becoming necrotic and releasing damaging contents into the tissue environment.\n\nC. This response serves a crucial repair function: the membrane of the lysosome acts as a physical patch to reseal the breach in the plasma membrane, while the controlled release of specific enzymes, like acid sphingomyelinase, facilitates the remodeling and removal of the damaged membrane area.\n\nD. The lysosomes are rapidly transported to the injury site to release a payload of proteases that specifically target and degrade the foreign glass micropipette, neutralizing the source of the injury before it can cause further damage.\n\nE. This process is a specialized form of endocytosis where the lysosomes essentially \"swallow\" the damaged section of the plasma membrane from the outside, internalizing the wound for subsequent degradation within the cell's cytoplasm.", "solution": "We start from the physical and biochemical trigger of the response. A discrete membrane puncture establishes an immediate local influx of calcium due to the steep transmembrane gradient, with $[Ca^{2+}]_{o} \\gg [Ca^{2+}]_{i}$. The local rise in $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ at the wound site activates calcium-sensing exocytic machinery on lysosomes (notably synaptotagmin VII acting as a $Ca^{2+}$ sensor) and cognate SNAREs, producing rapid, $Ca^{2+}$-dependent fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane.\n\nThe first functional consequence of this fusion is mechanical and restorative: lysosomal exocytosis adds lysosomal membrane to the plasma membrane. This added lipid provides membrane area and can serve as a physical patch to reseal the discontinuity created by the puncture, thereby restoring membrane integrity and preventing further ionic imbalance and cytosolic loss.\n\nThe second functional consequence is enzymatic remodeling of the wounded membrane region. Fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane releases soluble and luminally oriented enzymes, prominently acid sphingomyelinase, into the extracellular leaflet at the wound site. Acid sphingomyelinase catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide in the outer leaflet. The generation of ceramide-rich microdomains alters membrane biophysical properties (e.g., promotes negative curvature and lateral phase reorganization), which facilitates membrane remodeling processes such as endocytosis or microvesicle shedding. These processes assist in removing or internalizing the damaged membrane area and any membrane-disruptive lesions, complementing the immediate patching function of added lysosomal membrane.\n\nBy contrast, signaling to neighbors as a primary purpose (option A) is not the principal role of this rapid lysosomal exocytosis; while released hydrolases exist, their central role here is membrane repair rather than paracrine immune recruitment. Induction of apoptosis (option B) contradicts the repair objective and time scale, as the response is designed to preserve cell viability. Degradation of the glass micropipette (option D) is implausible because the glass is extracellular and chemically inert to lysosomal hydrolases; moreover, the response targets membrane repair rather than foreign body degradation. Finally, describing the process as lysosomes externally engulfing the damaged membrane (option E) misrepresents the mechanism; the observed event is exocytosis (fusion adding membrane and releasing enzymes), not an external endocytic engulfment by lysosomes.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and comprehensive explanation is that lysosomal exocytosis supports plasma membrane repair by both providing membrane to reseal the wound and by releasing acid sphingomyelinase to drive local membrane remodeling and removal of damaged regions, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2301162"}]}
