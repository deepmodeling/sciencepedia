A powerful tool for testing such claims is the phylogenetic tree, which visualizes evolutionary relationships.

She collects samples and successfully sequences the complete genomes of three distinct biological entities:\n1.  The nuclear genome from a common garden pea plant (*Pisum sativum*).\n2.  The genome of the chloroplasts isolated from the same *Pisum sativum* plant.\n3.  The genome of a modern, free-living cyanobacterium species.\n\nShe then uses this genetic data to construct a phylogenetic tree to illustrate the evolutionary relationships among these three genomes. According to the widely accepted endosymbiotic theory for the origin of chloroplasts, which of the following statements best describes the branching pattern she would expect to observe in her phylogenetic tree?\n\nA. The chloroplast genome and the plant nuclear genome would be most closely related, forming a sister group, with the cyanobacterium genome branching off as a more distant relative (outgroup).\n\nB. The chloroplast genome and the cyanobacterium genome would be most closely related, forming a sister group, with the plant nuclear genome branching off as a more distant relative (outgroup).\n\nC. The plant nuclear genome and the cyanobacterium genome would be most closely related, forming a sister group, with the chloroplast genome branching off as a more distant relative (outgroup).\n\nD. All three genomes would diverge from a single common ancestor at the same point in time, resulting in an unresolved branching point with three equivalent branches (a polytomy).", "solution": "The relevant biological principle is the endosymbiotic theory, which posits that chloroplasts originated from an ancestral cyanobacterium that was engulfed by a eukaryotic host cell and became an endosymbiont that evolved into a plastid. This predicts that chloroplast genomes retain a direct evolutionary relationship to cyanobacterial genomes.\n\nFrom this principle, the expected phylogenetic pattern is that the chloroplast genome will share a more recent common ancestor with a free-living cyanobacterium genome than with the plant nuclear genome. Molecular evidence supporting this includes the bacterial-like (specifically cyanobacterial-like) features of plastid genomes and gene content, and numerous phylogenetic analyses that place plastid genes within the cyanobacterial clade.\n\nThe plant nuclear genome derives primarily from the host eukaryotic lineage (itself with complex ancestry, including archaeal-related informational genes and bacterial contributions), and although many genes of plastid origin have been transferred to the nucleus via endosymbiotic gene transfer, the nuclear genome as a whole is not sister to cyanobacteria. Therefore, when comparing complete genomes of the three entities, the closest relationship should be between the chloroplast and cyanobacterial genomes, with the plant nuclear genome more distant.\n\nThus, in a rooted three-taxon tree, the chloroplast genome and the cyanobacterium genome form a sister group, and the plant nuclear genome is the outgroup to that pair.

A primary driver was the profound metabolic advantage it provided to the host cell.

For the original host, this is its outer surface. For the final cell, the total metabolic surface area is the sum of the host's outer surface area and the surface areas of all its internal mitochondria. For this simplified model, we will assume that the relevant surface area of each mitochondrion is equal to the surface area of the original alphaproteobacterium it evolved from, neglecting the complex folding (cristae) of the actual inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nCalculate the metabolic amplification factor, which is defined as the ratio of the final total metabolic surface area of the mature eukaryotic cell to the initial metabolic surface area of the proto-eukaryotic host cell alone.
