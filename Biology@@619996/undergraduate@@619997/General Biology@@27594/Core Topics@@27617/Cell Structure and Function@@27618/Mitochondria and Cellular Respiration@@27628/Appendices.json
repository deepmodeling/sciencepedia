Genetic analysis reveals a mutation in the gene encoding the F0 subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase. This mutation renders the F0 subunit completely non-functional, preventing it from translocating protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The F1 subunit, responsible for catalysis, and all components of the electron transport chain remain structurally intact and functional. Assuming the patient's mitochondria are initially functioning under aerobic conditions, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate biochemical consequences of this specific defect within the mitochondria?\n\nFor clarity, the following acronyms are used:\n- ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate\n- NAD+: Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (oxidized form)\n- NADH: Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (reduced form)\n\nA. The rate of glycolysis in the cytoplasm will decrease to conserve glucose, and the pH of the mitochondrial matrix will decrease.\n\nB.

The electrochemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane will diminish, and the ratio of NADH to NAD+ in the mitochondrial matrix will decrease.\n\nD. Oxygen consumption will cease, and the inner mitochondrial membrane will rupture due to the osmotic pressure from accumulated protons.\n\nE. The electrochemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane will become exceptionally steep, and the ratio of NADH to NAD+ in the mitochondrial matrix will increase.", "solution": "The mitochondrial ATP synthase consists of the membrane-embedded $F_0$ proton channel and the catalytic $F_1$ head. With a non-functional $F_0$ subunit, proton translocation through ATP synthase is blocked, so $F_1$ cannot be driven to synthesize ATP because its rotary catalysis requires proton flux through $F_0$. Therefore the proton flux through ATP synthase is\n$$\nJ_{H^{+},\\ \\text{ATP synth}}=0.\n$$\nUnder aerobic conditions, the electron transport chain (ETC) pumps protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space while transferring electrons to oxygen. The proton motive force is\n$$\n\\Delta p=\\Delta \\psi-\\frac{2.303\\,R T}{F}\\,\\Delta \\text{pH},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta \\psi$ is the membrane potential, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature, $F$ is Faradayâ€™s constant, and $\\Delta \\text{pH}=\\text{pH}_{\\text{in}}-\\text{pH}_{\\text{out}}$.

As $\\Delta p$ rises, the free energy required to pump additional protons increases, which thermodynamically suppresses further electron transport. Consequently, $J_{H^{+},\\ \\text{pump}}$ falls until it balances $J_{H^{+},\\ \\text{leak}}$, and the electrochemical gradient becomes very large relative to normal coupled conditions.\n\nBecause electron flow slows when $\\Delta p$ is high, oxidation of NADH by the ETC diminishes. Thus NADH accumulates and NAD$^+$ is depleted, so the matrix ratio $\\frac{[\\text{NADH}]}{[\\text{NAD}^+]}$ increases.

Here $\\Delta p$ rises and oxygen consumption falls.\n- C is incorrect: the gradient does not diminish; it increases, and the NADH/NAD$^+$ ratio increases, not decreases.\n- D is incorrect: while oxygen consumption falls markedly, inner membrane rupture from proton accumulation is not expected; the number of pumped protons is too small to cause osmotic rupture, and leaks limit the gradient.\n- E is correct: $\\Delta p$ becomes exceptionally steep, and the matrix $\\frac{[\\text{NADH}]}{[\\text{NAD}^+]}$ increases.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2303429"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical concepts to real-world data is a key skill for any biologist.
