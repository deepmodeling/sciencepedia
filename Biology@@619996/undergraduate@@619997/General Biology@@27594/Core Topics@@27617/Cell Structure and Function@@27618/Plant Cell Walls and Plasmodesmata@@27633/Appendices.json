They have engineered a special line of cultured plant cells where a key gene for cellulose synthesis has been silenced. This results in the formation of viable plant protoplasts: cells that contain a normal plasma membrane, cytosol, and all typical organelles, but completely lack the rigid external cell wall. These protoplasts are initially maintained in an isotonic culture medium, where the concentration of solutes is equal to that inside the cells.\n\nFor an experiment, a single, healthy protoplast is carefully extracted from the isotonic medium and placed into a beaker containing pure, deionized water. What is the most likely immediate physical fate of this protoplast?\n\nA. The protoplast will undergo plasmolysis, causing it to shrink and shrivel.\n\nB.

This problem [@problem_id:2307790] delves into the relationship between the orientation of cellulose microfibrils and the final geometry of the cell. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario where microfibrils are laid down randomly, you will discover the principle of anisotropic versus isotropic growth and understand how oriented cellulose deposition is the key to generating elongated plant forms.", "problem": "A plant protoplast, which is an isolated plant cell that has had its rigid cell wall enzymatically removed, is placed in a hypotonic nutrient medium that allows for its survival and growth. The protoplast is perfectly spherical and immediately begins to synthesize a new primary cell wall. The cellulose synthase complexes in its plasma membrane are functional, but due to experimental conditions, they deposit new cellulose microfibrils onto the exterior of the plasma membrane in completely random orientations, forming a disorganized meshwork. As the cell takes up water, it develops a strong internal turgor pressure, causing the cell to expand against its newly forming wall.\n\nAssuming the cell remains viable and this pattern of random wall deposition continues, what will be the characteristic geometric shape of the plant cell as it expands and matures?\n\nA. A long, narrow cylinder\n\nB. A sphere\n\nC. An irregular, amoeba-like shape\n\nD. A flattened disc\n\nE. A cube", "solution": "The key physical driver of plant cell expansion is hydrostatic turgor pressure, which exerts an isotropic internal pressure $P$ on the cell boundary. The re-forming primary wall is deposited by cellulose synthase complexes that, in this case, lay down cellulose microfibrils in random orientations. A random in-plane orientation of stiff fibers yields an effectively isotropic wall in its mechanical properties: its in-plane elastic modulus, yield threshold, and wall extensibility are direction-independent. Denote the wall extensibility tensor by $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$; isotropy implies $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}=\\phi\\,\\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor and $\\phi$ is a scalar.\n\nFor a thin pressurized shell, Laplace’s law relates internal pressure to in-plane wall tension. For a sphere of radius $r$ and wall thickness $t$, the in-plane (meridional and hoop) stresses are equal:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{sph}}=\\frac{P r}{2 t}.\n$$\nThis equality of principal stresses reflects the isotropy of both the loading (hydrostatic $P$) and the geometry (sphere). In contrast, for a cylinder of the same $r$ and $t$, the hoop and axial stresses differ:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta}=\\frac{P r}{t},\\qquad \\sigma_{z}=\\frac{P r}{2 t},\n$$\nwhich would require anisotropic wall response to sustain differential expansion without distorting symmetry.\n\nCell wall expansion can be described phenomenologically by a Lockhart-type relation, in tensorial form,\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}=\\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\,\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}-Y\\,\\mathbf{I}\\rangle,\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}$ is the in-plane strain-rate tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the in-plane stress tensor, $Y$ is the scalar yield threshold, and $\\langle\\cdot\\rangle$ denotes the positive-part operator (no expansion below yield).

Therefore, the surface expands uniformly, preserving spherical symmetry. Because the protoplast is initially spherical and both the loading and the wall’s mechanical response are isotropic, symmetry arguments imply the body remains a sphere as it grows; any deviation would lack a preferred direction to be amplified.\n\nBy contrast, elongated shapes such as a long, narrow cylinder arise when cellulose microfibrils are predominantly aligned, creating anisotropic wall mechanics that permit expansion mainly perpendicular to microfibril orientation. Here, the explicitly stated random microfibril deposition prevents such anisotropy. Irregular or flattened shapes would require spatially heterogeneous mechanics or forces, which are absent under uniform $P$ and isotropic wall properties.\n\nHence, the maturing cell remains a sphere.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2307790"}, {"introduction": "Beyond providing structural support, the cell wall is perforated by plasmodesmata, which are channels that allow for direct cell-to-cell communication.

The study focuses on a monolayer of epidermal cells, which are interconnected by channels called plasmodesmata, allowing for the symplastic movement of molecules.\n\nAn experiment using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is conducted. The entire cytoplasmic volume of a single cell ('cell A') is exposed to a high-intensity laser, which irreversibly photobleaches the TF-GFP molecules within it, reducing its fluorescence to a baseline level, $F_{post\\_bleach}$. The fluorescence intensity of cell A is then monitored over time. The recovery of fluorescence is due to the influx of unbleached TF-GFP molecules from adjacent, un-photobleached cells.\n\nThe recovery of fluorescence intensity, $F(t)$, in cell A is found to be well-described by a first-order kinetic model:\n$$F(t) = F_{plateau} - (F_{plateau} - F_{post\\_bleach}) \\exp(-kt)$$\nwhere $F_{plateau}$ is the final steady-state fluorescence intensity achieved after full recovery, and $k$ is the first-order rate constant for the net transport of TF-GFP into cell A.\n\nThe experimental data shows that the half-time of recovery, $t_{1/2}$, is 35.5 seconds.
