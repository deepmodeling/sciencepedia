The nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) that perforate the envelope act as sophisticated gates. This first practice invites you to consider a thought experiment that clearly illustrates how the NPC functions as a molecular sieve, governing the passage of molecules based purely on their size.

There are two relevant mechanisms:\n- Passive diffusion through NPCs for small solutes, which depends on size (hydrodynamic radius) and is energy independent.\n- Signal-dependent, receptor-mediated transport (e.g., importin-dependent import driven by an NLS, or exportin-dependent export driven by an NES), which is energy dependent.\n\nGiven that both proteins are inert and lack an NLS and an NES, only passive diffusion is available. NPCs exhibit size-selective permeability. Let $r$ denote the solute’s hydrodynamic radius and $r_{c}$ the effective exclusion radius of the pore; equivalently, one may express the criterion in terms of a mass threshold $M_{c}$. Empirically, small proteins below the threshold diffuse passively; larger proteins require an NLS to enter the nucleus.\n\nDefine the protein properties symbolically as follows: protein $\\alpha$ has molecular mass $M_{\\alpha}$, protein $\\beta$ has molecular mass $M_{\\beta}$, and the NPC passive-diffusion cutoff is $M_{c}$, with the situation described by the inequalities\n$$\nM_{\\alpha}<M_{c}<M_{\\beta}.\n$$\nThis encodes that protein $\\alpha$ is small enough for passive diffusion, while protein $\\beta$ is too large for appreciable passive diffusion.\n\nPassive equilibration for protein $\\alpha$: Let $c_{c,\\alpha}$ and $c_{n,\\alpha}$ denote the cytoplasmic and nuclear concentrations of protein $\\alpha$, respectively. The net flux across the NPC can be modeled as\n$$\nJ_{\\alpha}=P_{\\alpha}\\left(c_{c,\\alpha}-c_{n,\\alpha}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $P_{\\alpha}>0$ is the effective permeability for protein $\\alpha$. After sufficient time, the system reaches steady state, so $J_{\\alpha}=0$, which implies\n$$\nc_{c,\\alpha}=c_{n,\\alpha}.\n$$\nThus, in the absence of binding or compartment-specific partitioning, protein $\\alpha$ achieves equal concentration in cytoplasm and nucleus. Because compartment volumes differ, the absolute amounts differ, but the concentration equality is the hallmark of passive equilibration.\n\nConfinement of protein $\\beta$: For protein $\\beta$, lacking an NLS and being above the size threshold, the effective permeability is negligible, modeled as $P_{\\beta}\\approx 0$. The corresponding flux,\n$$\nJ_{\\beta}=P_{\\beta}\\left(c_{c,\\beta}-c_{n,\\beta}\\right),\n$$\nis effectively zero for all practical concentration differences, so no appreciable nuclear entry occurs by passive diffusion. Since there is no active import without an NLS, protein $\\beta$ remains confined to the cytoplasm, with only negligible nuclear presence.\n\nConclusion: Protein $\\alpha$ will distribute between cytoplasm and nucleus with equal concentration at steady state, while protein $\\beta$ will be confined to the cytoplasm. Among the options, this corresponds to protein $\\alpha$ in both compartments and protein $\\beta$ in the cytoplasm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2321943"}, {"introduction": "While small molecules can diffuse passively through nuclear pores, larger proteins require an active, directional transport system. This process is powered by a remarkable molecular machine centered on the small GTPase Ran. The directionality of transport—whether a protein is imported or exported—is dictated by a steep concentration gradient of Ran bound to GTP, which is high in the nucleus and low in the cytoplasm. This exercise challenges you to explore the foundation of this gradient by examining what happens when a key regulatory enzyme, Ran-GEF, is misplaced, thereby revealing why the precise spatial organization of cellular components is vital for function. [@problem_id:2321962]", "problem": "The transport of proteins into and out of the nucleus is a tightly regulated process crucial for eukaryotic cell function. This transport is mediated by shuttling receptors, such as importins and exportins, and is powered by the Ran GTPase system. In a normal cell, a steep concentration gradient is maintained across the nuclear envelope: the concentration of Ran bound to Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) is high inside the nucleus, while the concentration of Ran bound to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) is high in the cytoplasm. This gradient is established by the strict localization of two regulatory proteins: Ran Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (Ran-GEF), which promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ran and is anchored to chromatin within the nucleus, and Ran GTPase-Activating Protein (Ran-GAP), which stimulates the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and is located in the cytoplasm.\n\nAn experimental cell biologist develops a mutant cell line in which the domain of Ran-GEF responsible for anchoring it to chromatin is deleted. As a result, Ran-GEF is no longer confined to the nucleus and instead diffuses freely throughout the cell, including the cytoplasm. Assume that Ran-GAP localization and the functions of all other proteins (importins, exportins, Ran itself) remain unchanged.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected primary consequence of this Ran-GEF mislocalization on proteins that contain either a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) or a Nuclear Export Signal (NES)?\n\nA. Both nuclear import of NLS-proteins and nuclear export of NES-proteins will be accelerated.\n\nB. Nuclear import of NLS-proteins will be inhibited, but nuclear export of NES-proteins will be accelerated.\n\nC. Nuclear import of NLS-proteins will be largely unaffected, but nuclear export of NES-proteins will be severely inhibited.\n\nD. Both nuclear import of NLS-proteins and nuclear export of NES-proteins will be severely inhibited.\n\nE. Nuclear export of NES-proteins will be inhibited, but nuclear import of NLS-proteins will be accelerated.", "solution": "In normal cells, spatial separation of Ran regulators establishes a Ran nucleotide gradient: Ran-GEF confined to chromatin converts Ran-GDP to Ran-GTP in the nucleus, making nuclear Ran predominantly GTP-bound, while Ran-GAP in the cytoplasm hydrolyzes Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP, making cytoplasmic Ran predominantly GDP-bound. This gradient underlies directionality.\n\nFor nuclear import of NLS cargo, importins bind cargo in the cytoplasm where Ran is GDP-bound. After translocation, nuclear Ran-GTP binds importin, triggering cargo release in the nucleus. The importin–Ran-GTP complex then returns to the cytoplasm, where Ran-GAP promotes GTP hydrolysis, freeing importin to reload cargo. Thus, cytoplasmic Ran-GTP prevents cargo loading by occupying importin and promoting the cargo-release conformation.\n\nFor nuclear export of NES cargo, exportins require Ran-GTP in the nucleus to form the trimeric exportin–cargo–Ran-GTP complex. After export, cytoplasmic Ran-GAP-driven hydrolysis of Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP is required to dissociate the complex and release cargo, allowing receptor recycling.\n\nWhen Ran-GEF is mislocalized and diffuses throughout the cell, it generates Ran-GTP in the cytoplasm. This collapse of the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic Ran-GTP gradient has two primary effects. First, for import, increased cytoplasmic Ran-GTP binds importins and prevents cargo loading in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting nuclear import of NLS proteins. Second, for export, increased cytoplasmic Ran-GTP stabilizes exportin–cargo–Ran-GTP complexes and opposes Ran-GAP-driven disassembly, impairing cargo release and receptor recycling in the cytoplasm; this reduces effective nuclear export of NES proteins. Therefore, reducing or abolishing the Ran-GTP gradient inhibits both import and export because the directionality of both cycles depends on nuclear Ran-GTP and cytoplasmic Ran-GDP.\n\nConsequently, the expected primary consequence of Ran-GEF mislocalization is severe inhibition of both nuclear import and nuclear export.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2321962"}, {"introduction": "Many proteins that regulate gene expression are not static; they continuously shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and their activity is often determined by their predominant location.
