{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Gap junctions form direct channels between the cytoplasm of adjacent cells, allowing for the rapid exchange of ions and small signaling molecules. This intercellular communication is vital for coordinating cellular activities, such as synchronizing heart muscle contractions or propagating metabolic signals. This exercise [@problem_id:2299279] challenges you to apply a fundamental physical constraint of these channels—their size exclusion limit—to determine if a crucial second messenger molecule, cyclic AMP ($cAMP$), can participate in this form of cell-to-cell signaling. By calculating the molecular weight of $cAMP$, you will make a quantitative prediction about its ability to diffuse through gap junctions, linking a molecule's chemical formula directly to its physiological function.", "problem": "In multicellular organisms, adjacent cells communicate directly through specialized intercellular channels. In animal tissues, one of the most important types of these channels is the gap junction. Each gap junction is composed of connexon hemichannels that dock together, forming an aqueous pore connecting the cytoplasm of two cells. These junctions allow for the rapid exchange of ions and small signaling molecules, synchronizing the metabolic and electrical activities of cell populations. However, the pore has a finite size, creating a size exclusion limit for a molecule’s passage. For typical mammalian gap junctions, this limit is approximately 1.0 kilodalton (kDa).\n\nConsider a scenario within a liver tissue where a hormone binds to a hepatocyte (liver cell), triggering a signal transduction cascade that elevates intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a ubiquitous second messenger. For this signal to propagate to neighboring hepatocytes that were not directly stimulated by the hormone, the cAMP molecules must be able to pass through the gap junctions connecting the cells.\n\nGiven the chemical formula for cAMP is $\\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_{11}\\text{N}_5\\text{O}_6\\text{P}$, and the following standard atomic weights in daltons (Da):\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 Da\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.01 Da\n- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 Da\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 Da\n- Phosphorus (P): 30.97 Da\n\nBased on a comparison of the molecular weight of cAMP with the size exclusion limit of a typical gap junction, which of the following conclusions is the most accurate?\n\nA. Yes, cAMP can pass through the gap junction because its molecular weight is substantially lower than 1.0 kDa.\n\nB. No, cAMP cannot pass through the gap junction because its molecular weight is substantially greater than 1.0 kDa.\n\nC. No, cAMP cannot pass through the gap junction because as a charged phosphate-containing molecule, it is repelled by the channel lining.\n\nD. Yes, cAMP can pass through the gap junction, but it requires an active transport mechanism due to its size being close to the exclusion limit.\n\nE. It is impossible to determine without knowing the precise three-dimensional folded structure of the cAMP molecule.", "solution": "Principle: Gap junctions formed by connexons provide aqueous pores that permit passive diffusion of small solutes with a size/mass exclusion limit of approximately $1.0$ kilodalton. For small molecules like cAMP, molecular mass is a suitable proxy for whether passage is feasible. Gap junction permeability does not require active transport and is not restricted to uncharged molecules; many ions and second messengers (e.g., cAMP, $\\text{IP}_{3}$, $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$) diffuse through.\n\nCompute the molecular weight of cAMP from its empirical formula $\\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_{11}\\text{N}_5\\text{O}_6\\text{P}$.

The strength of these junctions comes not simply from linking cell membranes, but from anchoring the robust intermediate filament cytoskeletons of neighboring cells into a tissue-wide network. In this thought experiment [@problem_id:2299230], you will analyze a hypothetical mutation that uncouples desmosomal adhesion from the cytoskeleton, challenging you to predict the specific point of failure under mechanical stress. This practice illuminates the critical role of proteins like desmoplakin as mechanical linkers and reinforces the concept of force distribution in biological tissues.", "problem": "In an experimental study on epithelial tissue integrity, a genetic engineering approach is used to create a cell line with a specific mutation in the gene encoding desmoplakin, a key protein of the desmosome. This mutation results in a truncated desmoplakin protein that can still bind to the desmosomal cadherins (desmoglein and desmocollin) via the plaque proteins plakoglobin and plakophilin, but has lost its C-terminal domain responsible for anchoring to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton (keratins). A monolayer of these mutant epithelial cells is cultured and then subjected to significant mechanical shear stress.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most probable observation at the cellular and tissue level?\n\nA. The cells will readily detach from one another, leading to a loss of monolayer cohesion, but the individual cells will remain structurally intact.\n\nB. The tissue monolayer will behave identically to a wild-type monolayer, showing no adverse effects from the mechanical stress.\n\nC. The cells will remain linked at their membranes via the desmosomal cadherins, but the cell membranes will detach from the underlying cytoskeleton and rupture, leading to widespread cytolysis and blister formation within the cell layer.\n\nD. The entire intermediate filament network within each cell will collapse into a perinuclear aggregate, even in the absence of cell-cell detachment.\n\nE. The desmosomal junctions will fail to form entirely, and the constituent proteins (cadherins and plaque proteins) will be found diffused throughout the cytoplasm.", "solution": "The desmosome mechanically integrates epithelial cells by coupling intercellular adhesion molecules (desmoglein and desmocollin) to the intermediate filament (IF) cytoskeleton via cytoplasmic plaque proteins (plakoglobin and plakophilin) and desmoplakin. Desmoplakin binds the plaque with its N-terminal region and anchors keratin IFs with its C-terminal domain. In the described mutation, the truncated desmoplakin retains its ability to bind the plaque (and thus indirectly to desmoglein/desmocollin) but cannot anchor to keratin IFs.\n\nLogical consequences:\n- Desmosomal cell-cell adhesion remains present because desmoglein/desmocollin and plaque components can still assemble with desmoplakin’s N-terminus.\n- Mechanical resilience is compromised because the key load-bearing linkage to the keratin network is lost; forces at cell-cell contacts cannot be dissipated into the cytoskeleton.\n\nUnder significant mechanical shear stress:\n- In wild-type cells, shear is transmitted from the membrane through desmosomes into the keratin IF network, preventing membrane damage.\n- In the mutant cells, the membrane-plaque-cadherin complex bears stress without IF reinforcement, leading to failure at the membrane-cytoskeletal interface. With cadherin-based adhesion intact, cells remain linked at their membranes, but the plasma membrane and cortex detach from the absent IF anchor, making membrane rupture and cell lysis likely. At the tissue level this manifests as intraepithelial blistering due to cytolysis rather than intercellular detachment.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is inconsistent: loss of cell-cell adhesion with intact cells characterizes defects in cadherins (e.g., pemphigus), not loss of IF anchoring.\n- B is incorrect because mechanical integrity is compromised without IF anchoring.\n- C matches the expected phenotype: adhesion persists at the membrane, but the uncoupled membranes fail under stress, causing cytolysis and blister formation.\n- D overstates a non-obligate outcome; IF networks may be disorganized but do not necessarily collapse into perinuclear aggregates solely from loss of desmosomal anchoring.\n- E is incorrect because desmosomes can still assemble; the truncation allows plaque and cadherin association.\n\nTherefore, the most probable observation is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2299230"}, {"introduction": "Tight junctions are the primary determinants of the barrier function of epithelial tissues, controlling the passive movement of solutes through the paracellular pathway.
