Unlike actin or tubulin, which assemble from a single type of monomer, the assembly of IFs is governed by strict, class-specific rules. This exercise [@problem_id:1780481] challenges you to apply these rules, specifically distinguishing between the assembly of homopolymeric (e.g., vimentin) and obligate heteropolymeric (e.g., keratins) filaments, to predict the outcome of a hypothetical mixing experiment. Mastering this principle is essential for understanding why different cell types express unique IF networks tailored to their specific structural needs.", "problem": "In a cell biology laboratory, a researcher purifies two distinct types of intermediate filament proteins. The first sample consists of a mixture of Type I (acidic) and Type II (basic) keratin monomers, isolated from human epidermal cells. The second sample consists of vimentin monomers, a Type III intermediate filament protein, isolated from mouse fibroblasts. Both purified protein samples are then combined in a single test tube containing a buffer solution with the appropriate salt concentration and pH to induce filament polymerization. After a sufficient incubation period, the contents of the test tube are examined.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately describes the final state of the protein mixture?\n\nA. A single population of uniform, hybrid filaments will form, with keratin and vimentin monomers randomly interspersed along the length of each filament.\n\nB.

The mixture contains keratin monomers from human epidermis and vimentin monomers from mouse fibroblasts. Keratins are of two types: Type I (acidic) and Type II (basic). Vimentin is a Type III IF protein.\n\nPrinciple 1: IF assembly specificity by class.\n- Keratin assembly requires obligate heterodimerization between Type I and Type II keratin monomers. Denote Type I keratin as $K_{I}$ and Type II keratin as $K_{II}$. The fundamental assembly unit for keratins is the parallel, in-register coiled-coil heterodimer $K_{I}\\!:\\!K_{II}$, not $K_{I}\\!:\\!K_{I}$ or $K_{II}\\!:\\!K_{II}$.\n- Vimentin monomers, denoted $V$, self-assemble predominantly as parallel homodimers $V\\!:\\!V$.\n- Cross-class coiled-coil pairing between keratin and vimentin (i.e., $K\\!:\\!V$) is not favored because of sequence and structural incompatibilities in the rod domains that determine dimer specificity.\n\nPrinciple 2: Higher-order assembly pathway is conserved but composition-specific.\n- For both keratin and vimentin, assembly proceeds from coiled-coil dimers to antiparallel, staggered tetramers, then to unit-length filaments and longitudinal annealing into mature $10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ filaments. Symbolically:\n$$\\text{dimers} \\rightarrow \\text{tetramers} \\rightarrow \\text{unit-length filaments} \\rightarrow \\text{mature filaments}.$$\n- However, this pathway proceeds independently within compatible monomer classes. Thus $K_{I}\\!:\\!K_{II}$ dimers assemble into keratin tetramers and keratin filaments, while $V\\!:\\!V$ dimers assemble into vimentin tetramers and vimentin filaments. Mixed tetramers $K\\!:\\!V$ are not formed under standard conditions.\n\nPrinciple 3: Species origin does not prevent in vitro assembly.\n- IF assembly determinants are highly conserved. Human keratins assemble with human keratins; mouse vimentin assembles with mouse vimentin. Cross-species incompatibility is not a general barrier when proteins are within the same class; here, the relevant question is not species but class specificity.\n\nApplication to the mixture:\n- In the provided buffer with appropriate salt and pH, $K_{I}$ and $K_{II}$ will form $K_{I}\\!:\\!K_{II}$ dimers and proceed to keratin filaments.\n- Vimentin monomers $V$ will form $V\\!:\\!V$ dimers and proceed to vimentin filaments.\n- There will be no hybrid filaments with keratin and vimentin randomly interspersed, because $K\\!:\\!V$ coiled-coil formation is not supported.\n- Therefore, both types of filaments will assemble, but they will remain compositionally distinct.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because hybrid keratin-vimentin filaments do not form; intermixing along a single filament is not supported.\n- B is incorrect because vimentin readily assembles into filaments under suitable conditions.\n- C is correct: two distinct filament populations will form, one purely keratin and one purely vimentin.\n- D is incorrect because species difference (human versus mouse) does not prevent in vitro assembly.\n- E is incorrect because keratin Type I and II together assemble efficiently; they will not remain soluble under conducive conditions.\n\nThus, the final state is two structurally distinct filament populations, one keratin and one vimentin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1780481"}, {"introduction": "The highly dynamic nature of the actin cytoskeleton, which powers processes like cell migration and division, is driven by the continuous addition and removal of actin monomers at the two ends of a filament.

In a dilute solution of globular actin monomers, polymerization at each end is well described by mass-action kinetics: the addition of subunits to a given end is a bimolecular process with rate proportional to the monomer concentration, and the loss of subunits from that end is a first-order process independent of monomer concentration.

This problem [@problem_id:2352693] presents a classic cell biology detective scenario, where you must interpret experimental observations of cargo movement to deduce both the properties of a novel motor protein and the underlying cytoskeletal architecture of a neuron's axon and dendrites, illustrating how local molecular rules generate global cellular organization.", "problem": "In a neuroscience laboratory, a research team is studying intracellular transport in cultured mammalian neurons. They identify a novel motor protein, which they name \"AxoDendro Mover\" (ADM), responsible for transporting vesicles filled with essential metabolic enzymes. To characterize its function, they attach a fluorescent tag to ADM and use live-cell imaging to track the net direction of vesicle movement within different neuronal compartments.\n\nTheir observations are as follows:\n1.  In axons, all observed vesicles containing ADM consistently move from the region near the cell body towards the axon terminal.\n2.  In dendrites, they observe two distinct populations of ADM-containing vesicles. Approximately half of the vesicles move from the cell body towards the dendritic tips, while the other half move from the dendritic tips back towards the cell body.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume that a motor protein can only move in one direction relative to microtubule polarity: either towards the plus-end (a \"plus-end directed\" motor) or towards the minus-end (a \"minus-end directed\" motor).\n\nBased on these experimental observations, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion about the ADM protein and the underlying microtubule organization in neurons?\n\nA. ADM is a plus-end directed motor, and microtubules have a uniform polarity (all plus-ends pointing away from the cell body) in both axons and dendrites.\n\nB.

The problem states that in axons, all vesicles with ADM move from the cell body towards the axon terminal. This direction of transport, away from the cell body, is known as anterograde transport. In vertebrate neurons, the axonal cytoskeleton is characterized by a highly organized array of microtubules. These microtubules are uniformly oriented such that their plus-ends point away from the cell body (distally, towards the axon terminal) and their minus-ends point towards the cell body (proximally). Since the ADM-driven vesicles move towards the axon terminal, they must be moving along the microtubules towards their plus-ends. Therefore, we can conclude that ADM is a plus-end directed motor protein.\n\nNext, let's analyze the observation in the dendrites. The problem states that two populations of vesicles are observed: one moving away from the cell body and another moving towards the cell body. We have already established from the axonal data that ADM is a plus-end directed motor. A plus-end directed motor will always move towards the plus-end of the microtubule track it is on. The observation of movement both away from and towards the cell body, driven by the same unidirectional motor protein, can only be explained if the underlying microtubule tracks are themselves oriented in two different directions. This implies that in dendrites, some microtubules have their plus-ends pointing away from the cell body, while others have their plus-ends pointing towards the cell body. This arrangement is known as mixed polarity.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the given options based on our conclusions:\n-   ADM is a plus-end directed motor.\n-   Axons have microtubules with uniform plus-end-out polarity.\n-   Dendrites have microtubules with mixed polarity.\n\nA. ADM is a plus-end directed motor, and microtubules have a uniform polarity (all plus-ends pointing away from the cell body) in both axons and dendrites. This is incorrect because uniform polarity in dendrites would not allow for the observed bidirectional movement towards and away from the cell body.\n\nB. ADM is a minus-end directed motor, and microtubules have a uniform polarity (all plus-ends pointing away from the cell body) in both axons and dendrites. This is incorrect because if ADM were a minus-end motor, it would move towards the cell body in axons, which contradicts the observation.\n\nC. ADM is a plus-end directed motor; microtubules in axons have a uniform polarity (plus-ends out), while microtubules in dendrites have a mixed polarity. This statement is fully consistent with both of our deductions. The motor's nature explains the axon transport direction, and the combination of the motor's nature and the dendritic microtubule structure explains the bidirectional transport in dendrites.\n\nD. ADM is a minus-end directed motor; microtubules in axons have a uniform polarity (plus-ends out), while microtubules in dendrites have a mixed polarity. This is incorrect because it misidentifies ADM as a minus-end directed motor.\n\nE. The observations are contradictory, as a single type of motor protein cannot produce bidirectional movement within the same cellular compartment. This is incorrect. The observations are not contradictory; they are a classic demonstration of how a unidirectional motor can produce bidirectional net transport if the tracks it runs on have mixed polarity.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2352693"}]}
