This first practice presents a classic experiment that provides a powerful visual demonstration of a key peroxisomal function: the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$). By comparing the reaction of raw and boiled potato tissue to $H_2O_2$, this exercise illustrates the potent catalytic activity of the peroxisomal enzyme catalase and the fundamental principle of enzyme denaturation by heat. Engaging with this problem will help you understand how to use simple controls to isolate and identify biological processes. [@problem_id:2307000]", "problem": "A student is investigating enzymatic activity in plant cells using tissue from a common potato (Solanum tuberosum). They set up three beakers at room temperature.\n\n- **Beaker 1**: A small cube of fresh, raw potato is placed in 50 mL of a 3% hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$) solution.\n- **Beaker 2**: An identical cube of potato is boiled in water for 10 minutes. After being allowed to cool back to room temperature, it is placed in 50 mL of a 3% hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$) solution.\n- **Beaker 3**: A small amount of sand, with a similar volume to the potato cube, is placed in 50 mL of a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution to serve as a control for non-biological surfaces.\n\nThe student observes the following results:\n- **Beaker 1**: Vigorous and immediate bubbling occurs on and around the surface of the raw potato.\n- **Beaker 2**: No bubbling or any other visible reaction occurs.\n- **Beaker 3**: No bubbling or any other visible reaction occurs.\n\nBased on these experimental observations and your understanding of eukaryotic cell biology, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation?\n\nA. The bubbling in Beaker 1 is due to the enzyme catalase, located in peroxisomes, breaking down hydrogen peroxide. Boiling the potato denatures this enzyme, preventing the reaction in Beaker 2.\n\nB. The reaction is a form of cellular respiration occurring in the mitochondria of the potato cells, releasing oxygen. Boiling stops respiration, hence no bubbles in Beaker 2.\n\nC. Hydrogen peroxide naturally decomposes into oxygen gas in the presence of any organic material. The boiling process seals the potato's surface, preventing the peroxide from contacting the internal tissues.\n\nD. The bubbles are carbon dioxide produced by the enzyme amylase, found in the potato's amyloplasts, reacting with the hydrogen peroxide. The sand in Beaker 3 lacks the necessary starches for this reaction.\n\nE. The bubbling is a physical process caused by water rapidly exiting the potato cells via osmosis. Boiling damages the cell membranes, which stops this osmotic process.", "solution": "First, identify the chemical reaction that would produce immediate gas bubbles when plant tissue contacts hydrogen peroxide. The well-known enzymatic reaction is the catalase-catalyzed disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide:\n$$2H_2O_2 \\rightarrow 2H_2O + O_2$$\nThe $O_2$ generated appears as vigorous bubbles. In eukaryotic cells, catalase is localized in peroxisomes, where it detoxifies $H_2O_2$ formed by various oxidative reactions. Therefore, raw potato tissue placed in hydrogen peroxide (Beaker 1) will exhibit immediate bubbling due to catalase activity on the tissue surface and exposed cells.\n\nSecond, apply the principle that enzymes are proteins whose three-dimensional conformation is essential for catalytic function. Heating to boiling denatures proteins by disrupting noncovalent interactions that maintain tertiary and quaternary structure, abolishing enzymatic activity. Thus, boiling the potato (Beaker 2) denatures catalase, so when the cooled, boiled tissue is placed in hydrogen peroxide, the reaction does not occur and no bubbles form.\n\nThird, consider the sand control (Beaker 3). Sand lacks biological catalysts like catalase and does not present metal catalysts under these conditions. Although hydrogen peroxide can slowly decompose nonenzymatically, the absence of immediate visible bubbling under identical conditions indicates that the vigorous reaction observed with raw potato is enzymatic rather than a general surface or purely chemical phenomenon.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A correctly identifies catalase in peroxisomes as the enzyme responsible for decomposing $H_2O_2$ to produce $O_2$ bubbles and correctly explains loss of bubbling after boiling by heat denaturation of the enzyme.\n- Option B is incorrect because cellular respiration occurs in mitochondria, consumes $O_2$, and produces $CO_2$ and $H_2O$; it does not use $H_2O_2$ as the substrate nor produce $O_2$ gas as bubbles in this context.\n- Option C is incorrect because $H_2O_2$ does not decompose vigorously merely in the presence of “any organic material,” and boiling does not “seal” the potato surface to prevent contact; rather, it denatures enzymes.\n- Option D is incorrect because amylase hydrolyzes starch to sugars and does not produce $CO_2$; amyloplasts store starch and are not the site of catalase-driven gas evolution from $H_2O_2$.\n- Option E is incorrect because osmosis involves water movement across membranes and does not generate a gas; the observed bubbles are $O_2$ from a chemical reaction, not water efflux.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete explanation is that catalase in peroxisomes of the raw potato catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, and boiling denatures catalase, preventing the reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2307000"}, {"introduction": "Having seen what peroxisomes do, a critical question arises: how are these organelles built and supplied with the correct enzymes? This practice transitions from function to biogenesis, focusing on the sophisticated systems cells use to ensure proteins reach their proper destination. You will step into the role of a molecular biologist to design an experiment using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to verify a protein's location, forcing you to think critically about how molecular tools can interfere with the very signals they are meant to study. This problem highlights the importance of the C-terminal Peroxisomal Targeting Signal 1 (PTS1) and sharpens your skills in experimental design. [@problem_id:2329348]", "problem": "A research team has identified a novel enzyme, which they have named \"Xanthine Dehydrogenase Homolog 2\" (XDH2). Based on its predicted function in purine metabolism, they hypothesize that XDH2 is localized to the matrix of peroxisomes. Most peroxisomal matrix proteins are imported from the cytosol via a C-terminal targeting signal known as Peroxisomal Targeting Signal 1 (PTS1), a short three-amino-acid sequence (like -Ser-Lys-Leu) at the very end of the protein.\n\nTo experimentally verify the subcellular location of XDH2, the team decides to use a protein-tagging strategy involving Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a naturally fluorescent protein from the jellyfish *Aequorea victoria*. They will create a genetic construct that fuses the coding sequence of XDH2 with the coding sequence for GFP, transfect this construct into mammalian cells, and then use fluorescence microscopy to observe the location of the resulting fusion protein.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs is the most appropriate and conclusive for testing the hypothesis that the full-length XDH2 protein is targeted to the peroxisomal matrix?\n\nA. Create a construct that fuses the coding sequence of GFP to the C-terminus of the XDH2 coding sequence. Transfect this `XDH2-GFP` construct into cells and observe the location of the green fluorescence.\n\nB. Create a construct that fuses the coding sequence of GFP to the N-terminus of the XDH2 coding sequence. Transfect this `GFP-XDH2` construct into cells. Then, stain the cells with an antibody against a known peroxisomal membrane protein (like PMP70) that is linked to a red fluorophore. Use microscopy to check if the green and red signals co-localize.\n\nC. Create a construct that expresses only GFP. Transfect this `GFP-only` construct into cells and observe where the green fluorescence localizes to establish a baseline.\n\nD. Create a construct that expresses only the native, untagged XDH2 protein. Transfect this construct into cells and then use an antibody against GFP to determine the protein's location via immunofluorescence.\n\nE. Create a construct that fuses the coding sequence of the final three C-terminal amino acids of XDH2 to the C-terminus of the GFP coding sequence. Transfect this construct into cells and observe the location of the green fluorescence.", "solution": "The goal is to determine if the full-length protein XDH2 localizes to the peroxisomal matrix. This can be achieved by creating a fusion protein with a fluorescent reporter like Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and observing its location in living or fixed cells using fluorescence microscopy.\n\nFirst, we must consider the mechanism of peroxisomal protein import. The problem states that most peroxisomal matrix proteins possess a C-terminal Peroxisomal Targeting Signal 1 (PTS1). This signal is a short amino acid sequence at the extreme C-terminus of the protein that is recognized by the import receptor PEX5 in the cytosol, which then mediates transport into the peroxisome. The key feature is that the signal must be at the very end of the protein to be recognized.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Create a construct that fuses the coding sequence of GFP to the C-terminus of the XDH2 coding sequence (`XDH2-GFP`).**\nThis design is flawed. Fusing the entire GFP protein (which is about 238 amino acids long) to the C-terminus of XDH2 would place GFP *after* the putative PTS1 signal. This would block the signal, making it inaccessible to the PEX5 import receptor. As a result, the fusion protein would likely fail to be imported into the peroxisome and would remain in the cytosol, leading to a false-negative result. This experiment would incorrectly suggest that XDH2 is not a peroxisomal protein.\n\n**B. Create a construct that fuses the coding sequence of GFP to the N-terminus of the XDH2 coding sequence (`GFP-XDH2`). Then, stain for a known peroxisomal marker and check for co-localization.**\nThis is the most appropriate design. By fusing GFP to the N-terminus of XDH2, the C-terminus of XDH2 remains free and exposed. If XDH2 has a functional PTS1 signal, it will be accessible to the import machinery, and the entire `GFP-XDH2` fusion protein should be transported into the peroxisomes. To confirm this, it is essential to demonstrate that the green signal from GFP is in the same location as a known peroxisomal marker. Staining the cells with an antibody for a peroxisomal protein (like the peroxisomal membrane protein PMP70) tagged with a red fluorophore allows for a co-localization analysis. If the green (GFP-XDH2) and red (PMP70) signals overlap perfectly when the images are merged, it provides strong, conclusive evidence that XDH2 is indeed targeted to peroxisomes.\n\n**C. Create a construct that expresses only GFP (`GFP-only`).**\nThis experiment represents an important control, but it is not the primary experiment to test the hypothesis. When expressed alone, GFP is a relatively small protein that lacks any specific targeting signals. Consequently, it diffuses passively throughout the cytosol and, due to its small size, can also enter the nucleus. Observing this diffuse pattern confirms that the GFP tag itself does not have an intrinsic affinity for peroxisomes. While this control is necessary to interpret the main experiment correctly, it does not provide any information about the localization of XDH2.\n\n**D. Create a construct that expresses only the native, untagged XDH2 protein and detect with an anti-GFP antibody.**\nThis design is nonsensical. Immunofluorescence relies on an antibody binding specifically to its target antigen. If the cells are expressing only untagged XDH2, there is no GFP protein present. Therefore, an antibody against GFP will have nothing to bind to, and the experiment will yield no signal and no information. To detect the native protein, one would need an antibody specific to XDH2 itself.\n\n**E. Create a construct that fuses the C-terminal tripeptide of XDH2 to the C-terminus of GFP.**\nThis experiment tests a related but different hypothesis. It specifically asks whether the C-terminal sequence of XDH2 is *sufficient* to act as a peroxisomal targeting signal. If the resulting GFP-tripeptide fusion protein localizes to peroxisomes, it strongly suggests that the sequence is a functional PTS1. However, this experiment does not test the localization of the *full-length* XDH2 protein. It is possible, though less common, that other domains within the full-length XDH2 protein could mask the PTS1 or contain a different, dominant targeting signal that directs the protein elsewhere. Therefore, while informative, this experiment is not as conclusive for determining the final destination of the entire XDH2 protein as the experiment described in option B.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B describes the most complete and direct experimental strategy to determine if the full-length XDH2 protein is localized to the peroxisomal matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2329348"}, {"introduction": "Observing a biological process is the first step, but quantifying it is essential for rigorous science.
