{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding how cells interact with their environment begins with a fundamental question: is their attachment to a surface specific or random? This practice exercise places you in the role of a cell biologist designing a foundational experiment. By comparing cell behavior on different surfaces, you can uncover the specific molecular requirements for cell adhesion, a critical first step in building tissues [@problem_id:2341874].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating a newly isolated animal cell line, designated \"Cell-Y\", to understand its requirements for adhesion. The researcher hypothesizes that Cell-Y depends on the glycoprotein fibronectin, a major component of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM), for attachment and spreading. To test this hypothesis, the biologist prepares an experiment. Two types of sterile plastic culture dishes are used. Dish A is an untreated standard tissue culture dish. Dish B is an identical dish that has been pre-coated with a solution of purified fibronectin, allowed to adsorb to the surface, and then rinsed to remove any unbound protein. Equal numbers of Cell-Y are seeded into both Dish A and Dish B, in identical culture media. The dishes are incubated for several hours under standard conditions, after which the cells are observed using a phase-contrast microscope.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes would provide the strongest evidence to support the hypothesis that Cell-Y requires fibronectin for adhesion and spreading?\n\nA. In both Dish A and Dish B, the majority of cells are firmly attached to the surface and have a flattened, spread-out morphology.\n\nB. In Dish A, cells are firmly attached and spread out, while in Dish B, the majority of cells are floating in the medium and have a rounded morphology.\n\nC. In both Dish A and Dish B, the majority of cells are floating in the medium and have a rounded morphology.\n\nD. In Dish A, the majority of cells are floating in the medium and have a rounded morphology, while in Dish B, cells are firmly attached and have a flattened, spread-out morphology.\n\nE. In both Dish A and Dish B, the majority of cells undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) and detach from the surface.", "solution": "We restate the hypothesis: Cell-Y requires fibronectin, an ECM glycoprotein, as a substrate ligand for integrin-mediated adhesion and subsequent spreading. Therefore, if fibronectin is necessary, then providing fibronectin on the surface should permit adhesion and spreading, whereas its absence should lead to poor adhesion, with cells remaining rounded and often floating.\n\nExperimental setup: Dish A is untreated plastic, expected to lack specifically presented fibronectin. Dish B is coated with purified fibronectin and rinsed, so the surface should present fibronectin to which fibronectin-binding integrins can adhere. Equal numbers of cells in identical medium and conditions ensure that any difference in adhesion and morphology is attributable to the presence or absence of fibronectin on the surface.\n\nPredicted outcome if the hypothesis is correct: On Dish B (fibronectin-coated), cells should adhere strongly and spread (flattened morphology), indicating integrin-fibronectin binding and downstream cytoskeletal engagement. On Dish A (untreated), cells should fail to adhere robustly, remaining rounded and frequently floating, reflecting the lack of the required ligand.\n\nEvaluation of the provided outcomes:\n- Option A: Both dishes show firm attachment and spreading. This does not support a requirement for fibronectin because adhesion occurs without fibronectin coating, implying that Cell-Y can adhere via other ligands or nonspecific mechanisms.\n- Option B: Dish A adherent and spread, Dish B rounded and floating. This contradicts the hypothesis, as fibronectin coating should not reduce adhesion if fibronectin is required.\n- Option C: Both dishes show rounded, floating cells. This neither supports nor refutes the specific requirement for fibronectin; it suggests either poor cell viability or absence of required conditions on both dishes.\n- Option D: Dish A rounded and floating, Dish B adherent and spread. This matches the prediction under the hypothesis, providing strong, positive evidence that fibronectin is necessary for adhesion and spreading.\n- Option E: Both dishes undergo apoptosis and detach. This indicates a viability issue and does not test the adhesion requirement, thus does not support the hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the outcome that provides the strongest evidence for the hypothesis is the one where cells preferentially adhere and spread only on the fibronectin-coated surface while failing to do so on the untreated surface, which corresponds to Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2341874"}, {"introduction": "Once we know that cells rely on specific extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, the next question is how they produce and export these large, complex molecules. ECM components like collagen are assembled and modified along a sophisticated cellular pathway. This thought experiment challenges you to trace the journey of collagen through the cell by predicting the consequences of a specific disruption in its export route, providing insight into the logic of the secretory pathway [@problem_id:2341854].", "problem": "Fibroblasts, a type of cell critical for wound healing, are responsible for synthesizing and secreting collagen, the primary structural protein in the extracellular matrix. The synthesis and secretion of collagen is a multi-step process involving several cellular organelles.\n\nAn investigator is studying this pathway using a novel experimental drug called \"Exocystin.\" When added to a culture of healthy fibroblasts, Exocystin is observed to specifically inhibit the function of the SNARE protein complex, which is essential for the docking and fusion of transport vesicles with the cell's plasma membrane. The drug does not affect any other cellular processes.\n\nAfter treating the fibroblasts with a potent dose of Exocystin for several hours, in which cellular compartment would you expect to find the highest concentration of fully assembled, triple-helical procollagen molecules?\n\nA. Free in the cytosol\n\nB. Within the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum\n\nC. Within the matrix of the mitochondria\n\nD. Packaged within secretory vesicles in the cytoplasm\n\nE. Dispersed throughout the extracellular matrix\n\nF. Within the cis-Golgi network", "solution": "1) Identify the normal pathway for collagen synthesis and trafficking:\n- Collagen is synthesized as preprocollagen on ribosomes bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and translocated into the RER lumen, where the signal peptide is cleaved to yield procollagen.\n- In the RER lumen, procollagen undergoes hydroxylation and glycosylation, and three alpha chains assemble into a fully formed triple-helical procollagen.\n- Procollagen is then transported to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and sorting.\n- From the trans-Golgi network, procollagen is packaged into secretory vesicles that traffic to the plasma membrane.\n- Fusion of these secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (exocytosis) depends on the SNARE complex (v-SNARE on vesicles pairing with t-SNARE on the plasma membrane).\n- After secretion, extracellular procollagen is processed by proteases to tropocollagen and assembles into collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix.\n\n2) Define the drugâ€™s specific block:\n- The problem states that Exocystin specifically inhibits the SNARE protein complex required for docking and fusion of transport vesicles with the plasma membrane and does not affect any other cellular processes.\n- Therefore, biosynthesis in the RER, processing in the Golgi, and budding/transport of secretory vesicles proceed normally; only the final fusion step at the plasma membrane is blocked.\n\n3) Predict the site of accumulation of fully assembled triple-helical procollagen:\n- Fully assembled triple helix forms in the RER lumen and then moves forward through the Golgi; thus such molecules will be present within the secretory pathway.\n- Because exocytosis is specifically blocked while upstream steps continue, secretory vesicles loaded with procollagen will continuously form and traffic to the cell periphery but will be unable to fuse.\n- Over several hours, these procollagen-containing secretory vesicles will accumulate in the cytoplasm, resulting in the highest concentration of fully assembled procollagen within secretory vesicles.\n- Alternative options are excluded:\n  - Free cytosol: secreted proteins enter the ER lumen during synthesis and are not cytosolic.\n  - Mitochondria: not involved in this secretory pathway.\n  - Extracellular matrix: secretion is blocked, so extracellular levels decrease.\n  - RER lumen or cis-Golgi: while some procollagen is present, continuous forward trafficking shifts the bulk into post-Golgi secretory vesicles when exocytosis is blocked.\n\nConclusion: The highest concentration will be in packaged secretory vesicles in the cytoplasm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2341854"}, {"introduction": "The extracellular matrix is not a static structure; it is a dynamic environment that is constantly being remodeled, with a delicate balance maintained between synthesis and degradation. This equilibrium is essential for tissue development, repair, and normal function. In this final practice, you will explore the consequences when this balance is broken by analyzing a scenario where matrix-degrading enzymes act without their inhibitors, a situation central to understanding diseases from arthritis to cancer [@problem_id:2294912].", "problem": "The structural integrity and dynamic nature of animal tissues are maintained by a delicate balance in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This process is largely controlled by the interplay between two families of proteins: Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are enzymes that degrade ECM components, and Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which bind to and inactivate MMPs.\n\nConsider a hypothetical patient diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder. This disorder results from a mutation that renders their TIMP proteins completely non-functional. However, their cellular machinery for producing MMPs remains entirely normal. Assuming no compensatory mechanisms are in effect, which of the following options describes the most direct and primary consequence of this chronic MMP/TIMP imbalance on the patient's connective tissues?\n\nA. An abnormal accumulation of disorganized collagen and other matrix proteins, leading to widespread tissue fibrosis and stiffening of joints.\n\nB. A significant enhancement of cell-to-cell adhesion, resulting in the formation of overly dense and rigid tissue structures.\n\nC. A progressive and systemic degradation of the ECM, leading to compromised tissue strength, joint instability, and severely impaired wound healing.\n\nD. A massive increase in the rate of cell proliferation within connective tissues, as the degradation of the matrix releases a surplus of growth factors.\n\nE. A systemic autoimmune response where the immune system begins to target and attack native, undegraded collagen fibers.", "solution": "Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as collagens, elastin, laminin, and proteoglycans. Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases (TIMPs) bind MMPs in a stoichiometric manner to inhibit their proteolytic activity, maintaining ECM homeostasis. The balance between ECM synthesis and degradation determines tissue integrity.\n\nLet $S$ denote the rate of ECM synthesis and let $D_{\\text{eff}}$ denote the effective rate of ECM degradation. Under normal conditions, TIMPs reduce effective MMP activity so that $D_{\\text{eff}}<D$, where $D$ is the uninhibited degradation rate. The net rate of ECM change is\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{ECM} = S - D_{\\text{eff}}.\n$$\nIf TIMPs become completely non-functional while MMP production remains normal, inhibition is lost and $D_{\\text{eff}}$ increases toward $D$. Assuming no compensatory changes in $S$, the net effect is\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{ECM} < 0,\n$$\nindicating progressive ECM loss due to unchecked proteolysis.\n\nDirect tissue-level consequences of excessive ECM degradation include:\n- Reduced tensile strength and structural integrity of connective tissues due to degradation of fibrillar collagens and other matrix components.\n- Joint laxity and instability because ligaments, tendons, and cartilage depend on intact ECM for mechanical support.\n- Severely impaired wound healing, as MMPs excessively degrade provisional matrix and newly deposited collagen, preventing maturation and stabilization of the repair tissue.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because fibrosis involves excessive ECM deposition, which would be favored by decreased MMP activity or increased TIMP activity, not by loss of TIMP function.\n- B is incorrect because cell-to-cell adhesion is not primarily enhanced by ECM degradation; if anything, loss of ECM can reduce tissue cohesion.\n- C is correct because it directly describes systemic ECM degradation and its mechanical and reparative consequences.\n- D is not the most direct or primary outcome; while MMPs can liberate some ECM-bound growth factors, a massive increase in proliferation is context-dependent and secondary, and the dominant effect is tissue weakening from ECM loss.\n- E is incorrect because loss of TIMP function does not directly trigger an autoimmune response against intact collagen.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and primary consequence is progressive ECM degradation with compromised tissue strength, joint instability, and impaired wound healing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2294912"}]}
