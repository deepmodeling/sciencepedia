This exercise simulates a classic cell biology experiment that uses fluorescence to track the process of phagocytosis and intracellular digestion. By predicting where the labeled bacteria will accumulate, you can visualize the pathway of a food particle and understand the role of food vacuoles as dynamic processing centers within the cell [@problem_id:2325357].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the feeding mechanism of a freshwater protist, *Paramecium caudatum*. The protist is cultured in a medium containing a specific strain of bacteria that has been genetically modified to synthesize a bright red fluorescent protein, effectively making the entire bacterium glow red under appropriate illumination. After introducing the red fluorescent bacteria into the *Paramecium* culture for 30 minutes, the biologist isolates a single *Paramecium* cell, washes it to remove any external bacteria, and observes it using a fluorescence microscope. The question is: in which cellular compartment would the biologist expect to observe the most concentrated red fluorescence?\n\nA) The contractile vacuoles, near the cell periphery.\n\nB) The food vacuoles, dispersed within the cytoplasm.\n\nC) The macronucleus, located centrally in the cell.\n\nD) The cytoplasm, distributed evenly throughout the cell.\n\nE) The oral groove, as an external coating.", "solution": "Paramecium ingests particulate prey by cilia-driven currents that direct particles to the oral groove and cytostome, where phagocytosis encloses prey into intracellular membrane-bound compartments called food vacuoles. Once formed, food vacuoles detach and move through the cytoplasm, fusing with lysosomes for enzymatic digestion; this pathway concentrates ingested bacteria within discrete vacuolar compartments rather than dispersing them in the cytosol.\n\nThe fluorescent signal in this experiment originates from intact bacteria expressing a red fluorescent protein. After 30 minutes of exposure, many bacteria will have been phagocytosed and enclosed in food vacuoles. Washing the isolated Paramecium removes external bacteria, so surface-associated fluorescence (including at the oral groove) should be minimal. The contractile vacuoles function in osmoregulation and do not accumulate ingested bacteria. The macronucleus is not a digestive or phagocytic compartment and would not contain the bacteria. A uniform cytoplasmic distribution would require dissolution and widespread diffusion of the fluorescent protein out of the bacteria and across membranes, which is not the expected immediate fate; instead, fluorescence remains concentrated within food vacuoles where the bacteria reside and are digested.\n\nTherefore, the most concentrated red fluorescence will be observed in the food vacuoles dispersed throughout the cytoplasm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2325357"}, {"introduction": "Organisms living in freshwater constantly face the risk of taking on too much water due to osmosis. This practice problem presents a thought experiment that challenges you to predict how a *Paramecium*'s primary defense against this, the contractile vacuole, would behave in a radically different, saltwater environment. Analyzing this scenario reinforces the concept of osmoregulation as a dynamic, adaptive process, directly linking the vacuole's activity to the surrounding environment's solute concentration [@problem_id:2325336].", "problem": "A biologist is studying osmoregulation in *Paramecium*, a single-celled protozoan that thrives in freshwater ponds. The cytoplasm of the *Paramecium* has a higher solute concentration than the surrounding freshwater, making it hypertonic relative to its environment. To cope with the constant influx of water due to osmosis, the organism uses a specialized organelle called a contractile vacuole. This vacuole rhythmically collects excess water from the cytoplasm and contracts to expel it from the cell, thus maintaining a stable internal environment.\n\nThe biologist first observes a healthy *Paramecium* in a sample of its native pond water and notes the regular frequency of its contractile vacuole's contractions. Then, the biologist transfers the same organism into a new medium: a concentrated salt solution that is known to be hypertonic to the *Paramecium*'s cytoplasm.\n\nAssuming the *Paramecium* survives the transfer, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the change in the activity of its contractile vacuole in this new environment?\n\nA. The contraction frequency will increase significantly to expel the salt that diffuses into the cell.\n\nB. The contraction frequency will decrease significantly, and may even cease for a period.\n\nC. The contraction frequency will remain unchanged, as it is a genetically programmed, constant biological rhythm.\n\nD. The contractile vacuole will reverse its function and begin to actively pump water into the cell to counteract water loss.", "solution": "Define $c_{in}$ as the effective solute concentration of the cytoplasm and $c_{out}$ as that of the surrounding medium. The osmotic pressure of each compartment can be modeled (for dilute solutions) by the van 't Hoff relation $\\Pi = i R T c$, where $i$ is the van 't Hoff factor, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Thus,\n$$\n\\Pi_{in} = i_{in} R T c_{in}, \\quad \\Pi_{out} = i_{out} R T c_{out}.\n$$\nWater flux across the membrane can be expressed phenomenologically as\n$$\nJ_{w} = L_{p}\\big[(P_{out} - P_{in}) - (\\Pi_{out} - \\Pi_{in})\\big],\n$$\nwhere $L_{p}$ is the hydraulic permeability and $P_{in}$, $P_{out}$ are hydrostatic pressures. In the absence of large hydrostatic pressure differences (a reasonable assumption for a small cell in an aqueous medium), the sign of $J_{w}$ is dominated by $(\\Pi_{out} - \\Pi_{in})$.\n\nIn native freshwater, the cytoplasm is hypertonic relative to the environment, so $c_{in} > c_{out}$ and therefore $\\Pi_{in} > \\Pi_{out}$. This makes $(\\Pi_{out} - \\Pi_{in}) < 0$, which favors water influx into the cell. To maintain volume homeostasis, the contractile vacuole expels this excess water. If each contraction expels a stroke volume $V_{s}$, then to steady-state first order, the contraction frequency $f$ scales with the water influx rate $J_{w}$ via $f \\propto \\frac{J_{w}}{V_{s}}$.\n\nAfter transfer to a hypertonic salt solution, the external medium becomes hypertonic to the cytoplasm, so $c_{out} > c_{in}$ and $\\Pi_{out} > \\Pi_{in}$. Then $(\\Pi_{out} - \\Pi_{in}) > 0$, making $J_{w}$ negative (net water efflux from the cell). Because water is no longer entering in excess, there is little or no water to collect and expel, so the required contractile vacuole activity drops markedly; the frequency $f$ decreases and may transiently cease while the cell loses water and shrinks until new osmotic adjustments occur.\n\nThis analysis rules out the alternatives:\n- It cannot be A, because the contractile vacuole expels water rather than selectively removing salts; ion homeostasis is handled by different transporters.\n- It cannot be C, because the vacuoleâ€™s rhythm is an adaptive response to osmotic influx, not a fixed program independent of environment.\n- It cannot be D, because the contractile vacuole does not reverse to pump water into the cell; its role is to expel water.\n\nTherefore, the contraction frequency will decrease significantly and may even cease.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2325336"}, {"introduction": "The large central vacuole is a hallmark of plant cells, playing a critical role in providing structural support through turgor pressure.

This influx increases the hydrostatic (turgor) pressure exerted on the cell wall, so $\\psi_{p}$ increases. Thus, the qualitative outcome is: vacuolar water potential decreases; turgor pressure increases.\n\nHence, the correct option is that the water potential of the vacuole will decrease, and the turgor pressure will increase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2325343"}]}
