{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey of a protein through the endomembrane system begins with a critical first step: gaining entry into the endoplasmic reticulum. This process is governed by a short amino acid sequence, the N-terminal signal peptide, which acts as an 'entry ticket'. This first practice problem explores a foundational principle of protein targeting by asking you to predict what happens when this ticket is missing or non-functional, thereby revealing the cell's default location for proteins that fail to enter the pathway [@problem_id:2341578].", "problem": "A biotechnology research team is engineering a eukaryotic cell line to produce and secrete a therapeutic protein called \"Protease-A\". The gene for Protease-A includes a standard N-terminal signal sequence that directs the newly synthesized protein into the secretory pathway, beginning at the endoplasmic reticulum. For the protein to be secreted, it must successfully enter this pathway.\n\nDuring a routine production run, the team discovers that while the cells are producing functional Protease-A at the expected rate, none of the protein is being secreted into the extracellular medium. A genetic analysis of this cell batch reveals a single, specific mutation in the Protease-A gene. This mutation has altered the coding sequence for the N-terminal signal peptide, rendering it completely non-functional. The mutation does not affect the translation, folding, or enzymatic activity of the rest of the Protease-A protein.\n\nAssuming all other cellular machinery for protein synthesis and transport is functioning correctly, where would the fully synthesized Protease-A protein molecules be expected to predominantly accumulate within these mutant cells?\n\nA. In the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum\n\nB. In the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus\n\nC. In the cytosol\n\nD. In secretory vesicles awaiting exocytosis\n\nE. In the extracellular medium, but in a misfolded state", "solution": "- Secretory pathway entry in eukaryotic cells requires an N-terminal signal peptide on the nascent polypeptide to be recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP). SRP binding pauses translation and targets the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it engages the Sec61 translocon. Translation then resumes with co-translational translocation of the polypeptide into the ER lumen, after which the signal peptide is typically cleaved. From there, proteins proceed ER lumen → Golgi apparatus → secretory vesicles → extracellular space.\n\n- If the N-terminal signal peptide is non-functional, SRP cannot recognize or bind the nascent chain. Consequently, the ribosome does not dock at the ER, and translation proceeds to completion on free ribosomes in the cytosol. In the absence of any other targeting signals (e.g., nuclear localization sequence, mitochondrial targeting signal, or peroxisomal targeting signal), the default localization of the fully synthesized protein is the cytosol.\n\n- The problem states: the only mutation renders the N-terminal signal peptide non-functional, while translation, folding, and enzymatic activity of the rest of the protein are unaffected, and all other cellular machinery is intact. Therefore, the protein will not enter the ER and thus cannot reach the Golgi, secretory vesicles, or extracellular space.\n\n- Evaluating options:\n  A. In the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum: requires a functional signal peptide and SRP-mediated targeting; not possible.\n  B. In the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus: requires prior ER entry; not possible.\n  C. In the cytosol: default localization when no functional ER signal peptide is present; expected outcome.\n  D. In secretory vesicles awaiting exocytosis: requires ER and Golgi transit; not possible.\n  E. In the extracellular medium, but in a misfolded state: secretion cannot occur without ER entry; misfolding is not implicated by the mutation.\n\n- Therefore, the fully synthesized Protease-A will predominantly accumulate in the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341578"}, {"introduction": "Once a protein has successfully entered the endomembrane system, its journey is far from over; it must be accurately sorted to its final destination. The trans-Golgi Network acts as a central sorting station, reading 'molecular zip codes' on proteins to direct them into the correct transport vesicles. This exercise focuses on the mannose-6-phosphate ($M6P$) tag, the specific zip code for enzymes destined for the lysosome, and challenges you to deduce the fate of these enzymes if the cell loses its ability to apply this tag [@problem_id:2319019].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the endomembrane system is responsible for synthesizing, modifying, and trafficking proteins and lipids. Lysosomes, a key component of this system, function as the cell's waste disposal and recycling centers. They contain a variety of hydrolytic enzymes, collectively known as acid hydrolases, which are active at the acidic pH maintained within the lysosome.\n\nThe journey of a lysosomal hydrolase begins on the rough endoplasmic reticulum, after which it travels to the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi, these enzymes are specifically tagged with a mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) marker. This M6P tag acts as a molecular \"zip code,\" ensuring that the hydrolases are sorted into vesicles that deliver them to the lysosomes.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in which a cell line has a genetic defect that inactivates the enzyme responsible for adding the mannose-6-phosphate tag to proteins within the Golgi apparatus. What is the most likely ultimate fate of the newly synthesized, but untagged, lysosomal hydrolase enzymes in this cell line?\n\nA. They will be packaged into secretory vesicles and released into the extracellular space.\n\nB. They will accumulate indefinitely within the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus.\n\nC. They will be transported into the cytoplasm and degraded by proteasomes.\n\nD. They will be mistakenly returned to the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nE. They will be found freely diffused and inactive in the cell's cytoplasm.", "solution": "The relevant trafficking principle is that soluble lysosomal hydrolases are sorted in the trans-Golgi network by binding to the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor after receiving an M6P tag in the Golgi. This tag is added by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase; without it, the hydrolases cannot be recognized by the M6P receptor and thus cannot be directed into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for late endosomes and lysosomes.\n\nNormally, lysosomal hydrolases:\n1) Are synthesized into the rough endoplasmic reticulum lumen via an N-terminal signal sequence and properly folded and glycosylated.\n2) Transit to the Golgi, where the phosphotransferase adds the M6P tag.\n3) Bind the M6P receptor in the trans-Golgi network, are packaged into vesicles, delivered to endosomes, and ultimately to lysosomes.\n\nIn the genetic defect described (loss of the enzyme that adds M6P), the hydrolases reach the Golgi but lack the M6P address tag. Without this tag, they fail to bind the M6P receptor and are not sorted into lysosome-directed vesicles. The default pathway for soluble proteins in the Golgi lumen that lack specific retention or retrieval signals is constitutive secretion. Therefore, these untagged lysosomal enzymes are packaged into secretory vesicles and released extracellularly.\n\nExcluding alternatives:\n- They do not accumulate indefinitely in Golgi cisternae because the secretory pathway provides a default exit (reject B).\n- They are not transported to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation; that pathway applies to misfolded ER proteins via ER-associated degradation, not properly folded Golgi cargo (reject C).\n- They are not returned to the ER; ER retrieval requires signals such as KDEL for soluble proteins, which lysosomal hydrolases do not carry (reject D).\n- They cannot freely diffuse in the cytoplasm due to membrane barriers; they remain within the endomembrane lumen unless secreted (reject E).\n\nThus, the most likely fate is constitutive secretion to the extracellular space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2319019"}, {"introduction": "The endomembrane system is not only a production line but also a rigorous quality control checkpoint, particularly within the Endoplasmic Reticulum. Proteins that fail to fold correctly must be identified and eliminated to prevent cellular damage. This final practice problem delves into the sophisticated process of ER-associated degradation (ERAD), presenting a compelling topological puzzle: how does a misfolded protein inside the ER lumen get destroyed by the proteasome, a degradation machine that resides in the cytosol [@problem_id:2319029]?", "problem": "A nascent polypeptide destined for secretion is translocated into the lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). Within the ER, chaperone proteins such as BiP (Binding immunoglobulin Protein) and calnexin attempt to facilitate its correct folding. However, if the protein remains persistently misfolded, it is targeted for degradation to prevent cellular stress. This process, known as Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation (ERAD), culminates in the destruction of the protein by the proteasome. Given that the misfolded protein is in the topologically distinct ER lumen and the proteasome is a large complex located exclusively in the cytoplasm, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and crucial molecular explanation for how this degradation is accomplished?\n\nA. The proteasome is actively imported into the ER lumen through the Sec61 translocon channel, allowing it to directly access and degrade the misfolded protein within the ER.\n\nB. The misfolded protein undergoes ubiquitination within the ER lumen by a specialized set of ER-resident E3 ligases, marking it for encapsulation into a transport vesicle that is subsequently directed to the lysosome for degradation.\n\nC. The misfolded protein is recognized and guided to a membrane-embedded protein complex that functions as a retro-translocon, actively exporting the polypeptide chain back out into the cytoplasm where it can then be ubiquitinated and targeted to the proteasome.\n\nD. Misfolded proteins aggregate in the ER lumen, triggering a signal that causes a portion of the ER to be engulfed by an autophagosome, which then fuses with a proteasome for bulk degradation of the enclosed ER segment.\n\nE. ER-resident chaperones cleave the misfolded protein into small peptides within the ER lumen. These peptides are then transported into the cytoplasm by a specific peptide transporter and are immediately available for antigen presentation or further breakdown.", "solution": "We begin from the stated topology: the misfolded substrate resides in the ER lumen, whereas the proteasome is located in the cytoplasm (and nucleus). Therefore, any proteasome-dependent degradation pathway must overcome the topological barrier of the ER membrane. The central mechanistic requirement is a means to move the misfolded luminal polypeptide across the ER membrane to the cytosol, where the ubiquitin-proteasome system operates.\n\nPrinciple of ER-associated degradation (ERAD): ERAD couples three core steps—(i) recognition of misfolded proteins in the ER, often with assistance from luminal chaperones (e.g., BiP, calnexin/calreticulin cycle, lectins such as OS-9/EDEM for glycoproteins), (ii) retrotranslocation (also called dislocation) of the misfolded protein across the ER membrane via a membrane-embedded protein complex, and (iii) cytosolic ubiquitination and extraction by an ATPase complex (p97/VCP) followed by proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitination machinery (E1, E2, E3) relevant to ERAD typically functions on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane; key E3 ligases (e.g., Hrd1) are membrane-embedded with cytosolic catalytic domains.\n\nLogical evaluation of options given this mechanism:\n- Option A is incorrect because the proteasome is not imported into the ER lumen. The proteasome is a large cytosolic/nuclear complex and does not traverse the Sec61 channel; Sec61 is used for co-/post-translational import into the ER, not for importing the proteasome.\n- Option B is incorrect because ubiquitination for ERAD occurs on the cytosolic side, not within the ER lumen; ER-resident E3 ligases relevant to ERAD have cytosolic catalytic domains. Moreover, ERAD targets are degraded by the proteasome, not by lysosomal delivery via vesicular traffic (lysosomal routes involve ER-phagy or autophagy, distinct from ERAD).\n- Option C is correct because it states the core ERAD solution: recognition of misfolded luminal proteins leads to their engagement with a retrotranslocation complex (e.g., complexes containing Hrd1, Derlin, or Sec61 in some contexts), ATP-dependent extraction into the cytosol by p97/VCP, cytosolic polyubiquitination, and subsequent proteasomal degradation.\n- Option D is incorrect because autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes, not with proteasomes; bulk ER turnover by ER-phagy is a separate pathway from ERAD and is not the canonical solution for routine misfolded luminal protein disposal in the proteasome.\n- Option E is incorrect because ER chaperones do not cleave misfolded proteins into peptides as a general mechanism; peptide transport relevant to antigen presentation (e.g., TAP) moves peptides into the ER from the cytosol, not from the ER to the cytosol.\n\nTherefore, the accurate and crucial molecular explanation for how a luminal ER substrate is degraded by a cytosolic proteasome is retrotranslocation to the cytosol followed by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, as stated in Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2319029"}]}
