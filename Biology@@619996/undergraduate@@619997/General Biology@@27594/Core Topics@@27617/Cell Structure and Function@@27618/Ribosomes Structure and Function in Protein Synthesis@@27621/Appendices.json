This mutation is located in the gene encoding the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a key structural and functional component of the small (30S) ribosomal subunit. Further analysis reveals that the mutation specifically alters the nucleotide sequence at the $3'$ end of the 16S rRNA molecule. This change completely abolishes its ability to base-pair with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence found on messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. However, the mutation does not affect the overall folding of the 16S rRNA, and functional 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits are still produced and can associate to form 70S ribosomes.\n\nGiven this specific molecular defect, what is the most direct and significant consequence for protein synthesis in this mutant *E. coli* strain?\n\nA. Protein synthesis rates will decrease slightly, as the ribosome will take longer to scan for the AUG start codon without the Shine-Dalgarno interaction.\n\nB.

The fidelity of translation will be compromised, causing a high frequency of incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into growing polypeptide chains.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the effect of a specific mutation in the 16S rRNA of *E. coli* on protein synthesis. The key information is that the mutation prevents the 16S rRNA from binding to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence on mRNA, but does not prevent the assembly of the ribosomal subunits.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the normal process of translation initiation in prokaryotes.**\nIn prokaryotes like *E. coli*, translation initiation is a highly regulated process that ensures protein synthesis starts at the correct location on an mRNA molecule. The process begins when the small (30S) ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA. This binding is not random; it is guided by a specific interaction.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the role of the 16S rRNA and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence.**\nThe 30S ribosomal subunit contains the 16S rRNA molecule. Near the $3'$ end of this 16S rRNA is a nucleotide sequence known as the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence. This sequence is complementary to a specific sequence on the mRNA called the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, which is typically located 5-10 nucleotides upstream of the AUG start codon. The base-pairing interaction between the anti-SD sequence on the 16S rRNA and the SD sequence on the mRNA serves as an anchor. This interaction correctly positions the 30S subunit on the mRNA such that the start codon (AUG) is placed precisely in the P (peptidyl) site of the ribosome, ready for the initiator tRNA (fMet-tRNA) to bind.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the effect of the described mutation.**\nThe problem states that the mutation in the 16S rRNA \"completely abolishes its ability to base-pair with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence.\" This means the crucial anchoring interaction described in Step 2 cannot occur. Without this interaction, the 30S subunit has no mechanism to recognize and bind stably to the correct starting point for translation on the mRNA.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the consequences for the stages of protein synthesis.**\nSince the 30S subunit cannot be positioned correctly, the initiation complex (consisting of the 30S subunit, mRNA, and initiator tRNA) cannot form properly at the start codon. Consequently, the large (50S) subunit cannot be recruited to form the complete, functional 70S ribosome at the correct site. The entire process of translation is therefore blocked at its very first step: initiation.\n\n**Step 5: Assess the given options based on this analysis.**\n- **A. Protein synthesis rates will decrease slightly, as the ribosome will take longer to scan for the AUG start codon without the Shine-Dalgarno interaction.** This is an understatement of the effect. The SD interaction is not just a facilitator for speed; it is the primary mechanism for recognition. Without it, initiation is not just slower, it is effectively prevented.\n- **B. The elongation phase of translation will be blocked because the peptidyl transferase center in the 50S subunit will be rendered non-functional.** This is incorrect. The mutation is in the 16S rRNA of the 30S subunit and affects initiation. The peptidyl transferase center is in the 50S subunit and is involved in elongation. The problem states the subunits themselves are functional, and translation never reaches the elongation stage anyway.\n- **C. The 30S ribosomal subunit will fail to correctly position itself on mRNA transcripts, thereby preventing the proper initiation of translation.** This is the correct and most direct consequence. The loss of the SD interaction means the 30S subunit cannot find and bind to the correct starting position, which is the definition of a failure in translation initiation.\n- **D. Assembled 70S ribosomes will translate the mRNA but will be unable to recognize stop codons, leading to the production of excessively long, non-functional proteins.** This is incorrect. The described mutation affects initiation, not termination. Recognition of stop codons involves release factors, not the SD sequence interaction.\n- **E. The fidelity of translation will be compromised, causing a high frequency of incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into growing polypeptide chains.** This is incorrect. While the 16S rRNA does play a role in decoding fidelity (ensuring correct tRNA-mRNA pairing in the A site) during elongation, the specified mutation affects the SD binding site, which acts during initiation. The primary effect is the failure to start translation, not errors during it.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the outcome is a failure to initiate translation because the small ribosomal subunit cannot locate its binding site on the mRNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2313456"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the discrete stages of translation—initiation, elongation, and termination—is not just theoretical; it has profound practical applications, especially in medicine.

It is hypothesized that one compound is an inhibitor of translation initiation, while the other is an inhibitor of translation elongation.\n\nTo test this, three separate in-vitro translation reactions are prepared. Each reaction contains a standard mix of bacterial ribosomes, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), amino acids, and the necessary enzymatic factors for protein synthesis. A specific messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript is added to all tubes, which is known to encode a single polypeptide that is 200 amino acids in length. The pool of amino acids provided includes radioactively labeled methionine ($^{35}$S-Met), which is not only the initiating amino acid but also appears several times within the polypeptide's sequence.\n\nThe three reactions are set up as follows:\n1.  **Control:** The standard in-vitro translation system with no antibiotic added.\n2.  **Test P:** The standard system with Compound P added at the start of the reaction.\n3.  **Test Q:** The standard system with Compound Q added at the start of the reaction.\n\nAfter allowing the reactions to proceed for a sufficient amount of time, the contents of each tube are analyzed by gel electrophoresis to separate the synthesized polypeptides by size. The gel is then exposed to an autoradiography film, which reveals the presence of radioactive polypeptides. A darker signal indicates a greater amount of radioactive product.\n\nAssuming that Compound P is the translation initiation inhibitor and Compound Q is the translation elongation inhibitor, which of the following outcomes would be the most likely result observed on the autoradiograph?\n\nA.

The amino acid pool includes $^{35}$S-methionine, which is incorporated as the initiating residue and also at internal methionine codons. Thus, any peptide that has incorporated at least the initiating methionine will be radioactive and visible on autoradiography after gel electrophoresis.\n\nControl (no antibiotic): Translation proceeds through initiation, elongation, and termination to yield the full-length product of $200$ amino acids. Because the product contains the initiating methionine (and additional internal methionines), a strong, distinct band at the full-length size (corresponding to $200$ amino acids) is expected.\n\nTest P (Compound P inhibits initiation): An initiation inhibitor blocks formation of the initiation complex on the mRNA, preventing the incorporation of the initiating methionine into nascent chains. With initiation blocked from the start, essentially no new polypeptide chains are synthesized. Consequently, there is no significant incorporation of $^{35}$S-methionine into polypeptides, and no significant radioactive band is observed.\n\nTest Q (Compound Q inhibits elongation): An elongation inhibitor allows initiation to occur (so the initiating $^{35}$S-methionine is incorporated), but stalls or terminates ribosomal progression at various positions during elongation. Different ribosomes will arrest at different points, generating a population of nascent chains with a distribution of lengths strictly less than $200$ amino acids. On a gel, this appears as a smear of radioactive species migrating below the full-length band, and the distinct full-length band at $200$ amino acids is absent.\n\nComparing these outcomes to the options, the expected pattern is:\n- Control: a distinct band at the $200$-amino-acid size.\n- Test P: no significant radioactive band.\n- Test Q: a smear of shorter radioactive polypeptides, all less than $200$ amino acids.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2313473"}, {"introduction": "Biological processes are often a story of trade-offs, shaped by evolutionary pressures.
