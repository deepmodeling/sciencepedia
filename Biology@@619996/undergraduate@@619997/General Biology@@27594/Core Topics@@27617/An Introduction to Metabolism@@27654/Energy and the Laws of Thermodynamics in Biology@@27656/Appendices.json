While the vast majority of plants perform C3 photosynthesis, C4 plants, such as maize and sugarcane, thrive in hot, arid climates. This advantage stems from a key difference in how they handle the enzyme RuBisCO, which can fix both $\\text{CO}_2$ (carboxylation) and $\\text{O}_2$ (oxygenation). The oxygenation reaction is wasteful, leading to a process called photorespiration that consumes energy and releases previously fixed carbon. C4 plants evolved a mechanism to concentrate $\\text{CO}_2$ around RuBisCO, effectively eliminating photorespiration but at an upfront energetic cost.\n\nYou are tasked with quantitatively comparing the energetic efficiency of a C3 and a C4 plant under a specific set of hot-climate conditions. Use the following simplified biophysical model and parameters:\n\n1.  **Energy Currency:** The primary energy molecules are Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH). For comparing total energy expenditure, assume the energetic equivalent of 1 molecule of NADPH is 2.5 molecules of ATP.\n2.  **Calvin-Benson Cycle:** The core carbon fixation process, used by both plant types, requires 3 ATP and 2 NADPH to convert one molecule of $\\text{CO}_2$ into carbohydrate.\n3.  **C4 Pathway:** The C4 plant uses a $\\text{CO}_2$-concentrating mechanism. This process costs an additional 2 ATP for every molecule of $\\text{CO}_2$ transported to the bundle sheath cells where the Calvin-Benson cycle occurs. Assume this mechanism is perfectly efficient at concentrating $\\text{CO}_2$, such that photorespiration is completely suppressed.\n4.  **C3 Pathway:** In the C3 plant under these hot conditions, RuBisCO's efficiency is compromised. For every 2 molecules of $\\text{CO}_2$ that it successfully fixes (carboxylation), it wastefully fixes 1 molecule of $\\text{O}_2$ (oxygenation). Each oxygenation event, including its subsequent salvage pathway (photorespiration), consumes a total of 2 ATP and 2.5 NADPH, and results in the release of one molecule of $\\text{CO}_2$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total ATP-equivalent cost per net mole of $\\text{CO}_2$ assimilated in the C3 plant to the total ATP-equivalent cost per net mole of $\\text{CO}_2$ assimilated in the C4 plant under these conditions.
