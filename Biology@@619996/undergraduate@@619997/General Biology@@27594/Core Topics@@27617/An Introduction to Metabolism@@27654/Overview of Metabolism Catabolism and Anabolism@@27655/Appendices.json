{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Metabolism is a dynamic balance between breaking down molecules to produce energy (catabolism) and using that energy to build complex new molecules (anabolism). But how tightly are these two processes linked? This problem explores the fundamental dependence of anabolism on catabolism through a thought experiment. By examining a cell that is provided with all the necessary building blocks but has its primary catabolic engine, glycolysis, shut down, you can directly probe the essential role of energy currency like ATP in making biosynthesis possible [@problem_id:2061301].", "problem": "A research team is studying a novel strain of *Escherichia coli* that possesses a complete loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), a crucial enzyme in glycolysis. The mutant cells are initially cultured in a minimal medium with glucose as the only carbon source, where they show negligible growth. The researchers then transfer these mutant cells to a rich, complex medium that contains an abundant supply of all 20 standard amino acids, all necessary purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, fatty acids, and vitamins. Despite the direct availability of all monomeric building blocks required for macromolecular synthesis, the mutant *E. coli* still exhibit a severely inhibited growth rate compared to wild-type cells grown in the same rich medium.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental biochemical explanation for the observed poor growth of the PFK-1 mutant strain, even in the nutrient-rich environment?\n\nA. The mutation in PFK-1 compromises the integrity of the cell membrane, preventing the transport of the supplied amino acids and nucleotides into the cell.\n\nB. The supplied monomers, such as amino acids and nucleotides, must first be catabolized through glycolysis before they can be used for anabolic synthesis.\n\nC. The blockage of glycolysis leads to a critical deficit in the cellular pool of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and reducing equivalents (e.g., NADH), which are required to energetically drive the polymerization reactions of anabolism.\n\nD. The accumulation of fructose-6-phosphate, the substrate for PFK-1, acts as a potent allosteric inhibitor for the enzymes responsible for protein and nucleic acid synthesis.\n\nE. The absence of a functional PFK-1 enzyme triggers a global stress response that halts the cell cycle, irrespective of the availability of nutrients or energy.", "solution": "We identify the biochemical block: a complete loss of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) prevents the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, the committed step of glycolysis. Thus, glycolytic flux from glucose to triose phosphates is essentially halted.\n\nFrom core bioenergetic principles, cell growth requires continuous production of ATP and reducing equivalents (NADH and NADPH) to drive endergonic anabolic and polymerization reactions. The central fact is that polymerization is thermodynamically unfavorable unless coupled to high-energy phosphate and redox currency. The generic coupling condition is\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{net}} \\;=\\; \\Delta G_{\\text{polymerization}} \\;+\\; \\sum \\Delta G_{\\text{high\\text{-}energy hydrolysis}} \\;<\\; 0,\n$$\nwhich requires sufficient intracellular pools of ATP (and GTP) and appropriate redox cofactors.\n\nConsequences of the PFK-1 block for energy and reducing power:\n1) Loss of ATP production by substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. The two ATP-generating steps,\n$$\n1,3\\text{-bisphosphoglycerate} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow 3\\text{-phosphoglycerate} + \\text{ATP},\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\text{phosphoenolpyruvate} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow \\text{pyruvate} + \\text{ATP},\n$$\nboth depend on flux past the PFK-1 step. With PFK-1 nonfunctional, these ATP yields collapse.\n2) Loss of glycolytic NADH production at glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase:\n$$\n\\text{glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate} + \\text{NAD}^{+} + \\text{P}_{\\text{i}} \\rightarrow 1,3\\text{-bisphosphoglycerate} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^{+}.\n$$\nThis reduces the supply of reducing equivalents that normally feed the electron transport chain to generate a proton motive force and drive ATP synthesis via ATP synthase. Thus both substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation are compromised by reduced input.\n\nWhy abundant monomers do not rescue growth:\n- Protein synthesis requires high-energy input at multiple steps. Aminoacyl-tRNA charging consumes two high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds:\n$$\n\\text{amino acid} + \\text{tRNA} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{aminoacyl-tRNA} + \\text{AMP} + \\text{PP}_{\\text{i}},\n$$\nwith subsequent\n$$\n\\text{PP}_{\\text{i}} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{P}_{\\text{i}}\n$$\ndriving the reaction forward. Ribosomal elongation requires GTP hydrolysis per elongation cycle. Without adequate ATP/GTP regeneration, peptide bond formation and elongation stall.\n- Nucleic acid synthesis uses NTPs/dNTPs as both monomers and energy sources; polymerization proceeds by\n$$\n\\text{(NMP)}_{n} + \\text{NTP} \\rightarrow \\text{(NMP)}_{n+1} + \\text{PP}_{\\text{i}},\n$$\nfollowed by pyrophosphate hydrolysis. Maintaining NTP/dNTP pools requires ATP-dependent phosphorylation steps and, for dNTPs, NADPH-dependent ribonucleotide reduction. Insufficient ATP and NADPH limits these processes.\n- Lipid and fatty acid synthesis require ATP (for carboxylation steps) and NADPH for reductive elongation. Without sufficient NADPH, reductive biosynthesis is curtailed even if acyl precursors are present.\n\nTherefore, even when all monomeric building blocks are supplied exogenously, the cell still must expend ATP and use reducing equivalents to polymerize and assemble macromolecules and maintain homeostasis. Blocking glycolysis at PFK-1 critically reduces ATP production (both directly via substrate-level phosphorylation and indirectly by lowering NADH supply to oxidative phosphorylation) and reduces overall reducing equivalent availability (NADH for respiration and, via network coupling, NADPH for anabolic reductions). This energetic shortfall is the fundamental cause of poor growth.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: PFK-1 is a cytosolic metabolic enzyme and does not intrinsically compromise membrane transport integrity.\n- B is incorrect: Supplied monomers are not obligatorily catabolized through glycolysis before anabolic use.\n- C is correct: The block causes a deficit in ATP and reducing equivalents, preventing energetically demanding polymerization and biosynthesis despite monomer availability.\n- D is incorrect: Fructose-6-phosphate is not a known global allosteric inhibitor of translation or replication machinery.\n- E is overly general and not the fundamental biochemical reason; the dominant limitation is energy/redox currency, not a nutrient-independent arrest.\n\nThus, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is the energy and reducing power deficit resulting from the glycolytic block.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2061301"}, {"introduction": "We have seen that catabolism must fuel anabolism, but how does a cell decide whether to break down resources for immediate energy or store them for future growth?

Under low EC (high $[\\mathrm{AMP}]$ and $[\\mathrm{ADP}]$, low $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$), the inhibitory effect of ATP is relieved and the activating effect of AMP/ADP predominates, so PFK-1 activity increases to accelerate glycolysis and ATP production.\n\nIsocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle catalyzes\n$$\\text{isocitrate}+\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\\rightarrow\\alpha\\text{-ketoglutarate}+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\\mathrm{NADH}\\,,$$\nand is allosterically activated by ADP and inhibited by ATP and NADH.
