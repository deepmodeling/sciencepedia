This bacterium's cell membrane contains the machinery for cellular respiration, including an Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and an ATP synthase complex. In an in-vitro experiment, the student prepares a solution containing the bacterium's isolated cell membranes, a surplus of NADH as an electron donor, ADP, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and a controlled supply of dissolved oxygen. Initially, the system is observed to have a steady rate of both oxygen consumption and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.\n\nThe student then introduces Compound Q, a synthetic lipophilic molecule. Compound Q is a weak acid that can readily diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the membranes. It has the property of binding a proton (H+) on the side of the membrane with high proton concentration, diffusing to the other side, and releasing the proton where the concentration is low.\n\nImmediately after the addition of Compound Q to the experimental setup, what would be the most likely effects on the rates of oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis?\n\nA. The rate of oxygen consumption will decrease, and the rate of ATP synthesis will decrease.\n\nB. The rate of oxygen consumption will increase, and the rate of ATP synthesis will increase.\n\nC. The rate of oxygen consumption will decrease, and the rate of ATP synthesis will increase.\n\nD. The rate of oxygen consumption will increase, and the rate of ATP synthesis will decrease.\n\nE. The rate of oxygen consumption will not change, but the rate of ATP synthesis will decrease.", "solution": "We identify Compound Q as a protonophore (an uncoupler): a weak acid that carries protons across the membrane from the side of high proton concentration to the side of low proton concentration, thereby increasing the proton conductance of the membrane and dissipating the proton gradient.\n\nIn oxidative phosphorylation, the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) pumps protons across the membrane, generating a proton motive force given by\n$$\n\\Delta p=\\Delta \\psi - \\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[H^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}{[H^{+}]_{\\text{out}}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta \\psi$ is the transmembrane electrical potential, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. The free energy available per proton moving down the gradient is $F\\Delta p$. ATP synthase uses the energy from the re-entry of $n$ protons to drive ATP synthesis, requiring\n$$\nnF\\Delta p \\ge \\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}},\n$$\nso the rate of ATP synthesis, $J_{\\text{ATP}}$, is an increasing function of $\\Delta p$ and falls when $\\Delta p$ is reduced.\n\nLet $J_{\\text{ETC}}(\\Delta p)$ denote the rate of proton pumping by the ETC. Due to back-pressure from the proton motive force, $J_{\\text{ETC}}$ decreases as $\\Delta p$ increases and approaches a maximal value as $\\Delta p \\to 0$. At steady state, the proton flux balance is\n$$\nJ_{\\text{ETC}}(\\Delta p) = J_{\\text{ATP}}(\\Delta p) + J_{\\text{leak}}(\\Delta p),\n$$\nwhere $J_{\\text{leak}}$ is the proton leak across the membrane. Introducing Compound Q increases the proton leak conductance, so for any given $\\Delta p$,\n$$\nJ_{\\text{leak}}^{\\text{(with Q)}}(\\Delta p) > J_{\\text{leak}}^{\\text{(baseline)}}(\\Delta p).\n$$\nTo satisfy the steady-state balance, $\\Delta p$ must decrease. As $\\Delta p$ decreases:\n- $J_{\\text{ATP}}(\\Delta p)$ decreases because the driving force for ATP synthase diminishes and may fall to zero if $nF\\Delta p < \\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}}$.\n- $J_{\\text{ETC}}(\\Delta p)$ increases because the back-pressure is relieved, moving toward its maximal uncoupled rate.\n\nSince oxygen consumption is stoichiometrically coupled to electron transfer through the ETC, the oxygen consumption rate increases when $J_{\\text{ETC}}$ increases. Therefore, the immediate effects of adding Compound Q are an increase in the rate of oxygen consumption and a decrease in the rate of ATP synthesis.\n\nHence, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2323138"}, {"introduction": "Cellular respiration is not just a powerful process; it is also exquisitely regulated to meet the cell's energy demands. This problem [@problem_id:2323145] explores a key regulatory mechanism known as acceptor control, where the availability of ADP dictates the pace of ATP synthesis.

They discover that its sole molecular-level effect in eukaryotic cells is to be a potent and specific inhibitor of the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT).
