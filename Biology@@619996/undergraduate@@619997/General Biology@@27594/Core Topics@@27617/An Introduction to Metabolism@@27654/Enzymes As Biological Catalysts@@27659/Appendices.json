The researcher systematically increases the concentration of the substrate, isomaltose, and measures the initial reaction rate (the rate of glucose formation).\n\nThe data shows that as the isomaltose concentration increases, the reaction rate also increases. However, after the isomaltose concentration surpasses a certain high level, adding even more isomaltose results in no further increase in the reaction rate. The rate becomes constant, having reached a plateau.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for why the reaction rate plateaus?\n\nA. The high concentration of isomaltose causes a change in the enzyme's tertiary structure, leading to its denaturation.\n\nB.
