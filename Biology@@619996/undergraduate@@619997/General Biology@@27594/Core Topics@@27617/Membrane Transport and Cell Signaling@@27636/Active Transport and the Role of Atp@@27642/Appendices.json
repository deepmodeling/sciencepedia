This first practice explores the critical distinction between ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis. By considering a scenario with a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, you will dissect the pump's mechanism and confirm that it is the energy-releasing cleavage of phosphate, not just the presence of the molecule, that powers the transport cycle [@problem_id:2275765].", "problem": "In a skeletal muscle cell, the process of muscle relaxation is critically dependent on the active transport of calcium ions (Ca$^{2+}$) out of the cytosol and back into the lumen of the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR), an intracellular calcium storage organelle. This process is mediated by the Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase (SERCA) pump, which utilizes the energy from Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to move Ca$^{2+}$ against a steep concentration gradient.\n\nConsider an experiment where a muscle cell is treated with a high concentration of a synthetic molecule, AMP-PNP. This molecule is a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP, meaning it can bind to the ATP-binding site of enzymes like the SERCA pump with high affinity, but it cannot be broken down to release energy.\n\nAfter the muscle cell has been treated with AMP-PNP, it is stimulated by a single nerve impulse, which triggers the normal release of Ca$^{2+}$ from the SR into the cytosol, causing a brief muscle contraction. Which of the following statements most accurately predicts the state of the cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration in the seconds following this stimulation?\n\nA. The cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration will remain significantly elevated above the normal resting level.\n\nB. The cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration will return to the normal resting level, but much more slowly than in an untreated cell.\n\nC. The initial release of Ca$^{2+}$ from the SR will be prevented, thus blocking muscle contraction entirely.\n\nD. The cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration will drop to a level far below the normal resting level as it is rapidly sequestered.\n\nE. The cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration will return to the normal resting level at a rate faster than in an untreated cell.", "solution": "The key physical principle is that cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ concentration, denoted $[Ca^{2+}]_{cyt}$, is returned to its low resting level during relaxation primarily by the SERCA pump, which uses the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport $Ca^{2+}$ into the SR lumen against its electrochemical gradient. Symbolically, the transport cycle depends on hydrolysis of ATP:\n$$\n\\text{ATP} \\to \\text{ADP} + P_{i},\n$$\nand without hydrolysis, the conformational cycle that couples energy to $Ca^{2+}$ translocation cannot proceed.\n\nIntroduce the flux balance for cytosolic calcium after a brief stimulus:\n$$\n\\frac{d[Ca^{2+}]_{cyt}}{dt} = J_{\\text{release}} - J_{\\text{SERCA}} - J_{\\text{PMCA}} - J_{\\text{NCX}} - J_{\\text{mito}}.\n$$\nImmediately after the single nerve impulse ends, $J_{\\text{release}} \\approx 0$ because ryanodine receptor opening is brief. In an untreated cell, $J_{\\text{SERCA}}$ is large and dominates clearance, rapidly lowering $[Ca^{2+}]_{cyt}$ back to baseline within seconds.\n\nAMP-PNP is a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog that binds with high affinity to ATP-binding sites but cannot be hydrolyzed. When bound to SERCA, it prevents the hydrolysis step required for the transport cycle, effectively setting\n$$\nJ_{\\text{SERCA}} \\approx 0\n$$\nunder high AMP-PNP, because the enzyme is trapped in a non-transporting state despite nucleotide binding. The plasma membrane $Ca^{2+}$-ATPase (PMCA) also requires ATP hydrolysis, so under the same conditions\n$$\nJ_{\\text{PMCA}} \\approx 0.\n$$\nThe remaining clearance pathways, the Na$^{+}$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger and mitochondrial uptake, satisfy\n$$\nJ_{\\text{NCX}} + J_{\\text{mito}} \\ll J_{\\text{SERCA}} \\quad \\text{(in normal skeletal muscle on the seconds timescale)},\n$$\nand are insufficient to restore $[Ca^{2+}]_{cyt}$ to resting within seconds. Importantly, the initial $Ca^{2+}$ release from the SR is not prevented because excitation-contraction coupling via the voltage sensor and ryanodine receptor opening does not require ATP hydrolysis for the brief opening that follows a single impulse.\n\nTherefore, following the stimulus in the presence of AMP-PNP, $[Ca^{2+}]_{cyt}$ will remain significantly elevated above its normal resting level for an extended period rather than returning to baseline within seconds.\n\nAmong the options, this corresponds to choice A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2275765"}, {"introduction": "Understanding that active transport is fundamentally about balancing fluxes—the active pumping in versus the passive leaking out—allows us to make quantitative predictions about cellular behavior.
