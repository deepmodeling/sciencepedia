However, because ions are charged, their movement is also profoundly influenced by the electrical field across the membrane—the membrane potential. This exercise [@problem_id:2302462] explores the crucial interplay between the chemical and electrical forces that together form the electrochemical gradient, a concept fundamental to understanding why the net flow of an ion can be much slower or faster than predicted by concentration alone.", "problem": "A typical neuron maintains a stable resting membrane potential, with the inside of the cell being electrically negative relative to the outside fluid. For this neuron, the extracellular concentration of chloride ions ($Cl^-$) is substantially higher than its intracellular concentration. Despite this strong concentration gradient that would favor the passive movement of $Cl^-$ into the cell through leakage channels, the observed rate of net $Cl^-$ influx is found to be very slow. Which of the following statements provides the primary physical reason for this observation?\n\nA. The plasma membrane is almost completely impermeable to chloride ions, even in the presence of channels.\n\nB. The negative resting membrane potential generates an electrical gradient that opposes the inward chemical gradient for chloride ions.\n\nC. Chloride ions are actively transported out of the cell at a rate that nearly equals the rate of passive influx.\n\nD. The high intracellular concentration of potassium ions ($K^+$) electrostatically repels chloride ions, preventing them from entering the cell.\n\nE. The large size of the hydrated chloride ion physically hinders its passage through the narrow protein channels.", "solution": "We analyze net passive movement of an ion across a membrane using the electrochemical potential difference. For an ion of valence $z$, the electrochemical potential difference from outside to inside is\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu = \\mu_{\\text{in}} - \\mu_{\\text{out}} = RT \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[X]_{\\text{in}}}{[X]_{\\text{out}}}\\right) + z F V_{m},\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is absolute temperature, $F$ is Faraday’s constant, and $V_{m} = V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}}$ is the resting membrane potential. For chloride, $z=-1$.\n\nGiven $[Cl^{-}]_{\\text{out}} \\gg [Cl^{-}]_{\\text{in}}$, the chemical term is\n$$\nRT \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[Cl^{-}]_{\\text{in}}}{[Cl^{-}]_{\\text{out}}}\\right) < 0,\n$$\nwhich favors inward movement. The neuron’s resting potential is negative, $V_{m} < 0$, and with $z=-1$ the electrical term is\n$$\nz F V_{m} = (-1) F V_{m} > 0,\n$$\nwhich favors outward movement of $Cl^{-}$ (i.e., it opposes inward entry of the negatively charged ion). Thus, the chemical (inward) and electrical (outward) forces oppose each other.\n\nAt electrochemical equilibrium, $\\Delta \\mu = 0$, which yields the Nernst equilibrium potential for chloride,\n$$\nE_{Cl} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[Cl^{-}]_{\\text{out}}}{[Cl^{-}]_{\\text{in}}}\\right).\n$$\nFor $z=-1$, this gives $E_{Cl} < 0$ when $[Cl^{-}]_{\\text{out}} > [Cl^{-}]_{\\text{in}}$. If the resting membrane potential $V_{m}$ is close to $E_{Cl}$, the net driving force is small. In the linear (Ohmic) description of passive ion movement through open channels,\n$$\nI_{Cl} = g_{Cl} \\left(V_{m} - E_{Cl}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $g_{Cl}$ is the chloride conductance. A small $|V_{m} - E_{Cl}|$ implies a small net current and hence a slow net influx, even if the channels are present and permeability is nonzero.\n\nTherefore, the primary physical reason that the net $Cl^{-}$ influx is very slow despite a large concentration gradient is that the negative resting membrane potential produces an opposing electrical gradient that partially cancels the chemical gradient, making the net electrochemical driving force small.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A is incorrect because the presence of leakage channels indicates nonzero permeability; the slow flux is due to small driving force, not near-zero permeability.\n- B is correct: the negative $V_{m}$ generates an electrical gradient opposing the inward chemical gradient for an anion.\n- C is not the primary reason in this context; while transporters exist, the slow net influx through leakage channels is explained by the opposing electrical gradient.\n- D reframes electrostatic effects but incorrectly attributes them specifically to intracellular $K^{+}$ rather than to the membrane potential; the membrane potential is the governing factor.\n- E is not primary because chloride channels are structured to accommodate hydrated $Cl^{-}$; size alone does not explain slow net flux when channels are present and selective.\n\nHence the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2302462"}, {"introduction": "A cell's resting membrane potential is not a fixed property but a dynamic steady state determined by the concentration gradients and relative permeabilities of several key ions.

The GHK equation relates the membrane potential to the concentrations and permeabilities of multiple ions. The general form of the GHK equation is:\n$$V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\sum_i P_{cation,i}[cation_i]_{out} + \\sum_j P_{anion,j}[anion_j]_{in}}{\\sum_i P_{cation,i}[cation_i]_{in} + \\sum_j P_{anion,j}[anion_j]_{out}} \\right)$$\nFor the ions K⁺, Na⁺, and Cl⁻, this becomes:\n$$V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K^+]_{out} + P_{Na}[Na^+]_{out} + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_{in}}{P_K[K^+]_{in} + P_{Na}[Na^+]_{in} + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_{out}} \\right)$$\n\nThe initial relative permeabilities are given as $P_K = 1$, $P_{Na} = 0.04$, and $P_{Cl} = 0.45$. The toxin blocks 90% of the K⁺ channels, which means the permeability to K⁺ is reduced by 90%. So, the new permeability to potassium, $P_K'$, is:\n$$P_K' = P_K \\times (1 - 0.90) = 1 \\times 0.10 = 0.1$$\nThe permeabilities for Na⁺ and Cl⁻ remain unchanged: $P_{Na} = 0.04$ and $P_{Cl} = 0.45$.\n\nNow we can substitute these new permeabilities and the given ion concentrations into the GHK equation to find the new membrane potential, $V_m'$.

The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential and the equilibrium potential (Nernst potential) for that ion:\n$$DF_{Na} = V_m' - E_{Na}$$\nFirst, we need to calculate the Nernst potential for Na⁺, $E_{Na}$, using the Nernst equation:\n$$E_{Na} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[Na^+]_{out}}{[Na^+]_{in}} \\right)$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$E_{Na} = 25.3 \\text{ mV} \\times \\ln \\left( \\frac{440}{50} \\right)$$\n$$E_{Na} = 25.3 \\text{ mV} \\times \\ln(8.8)$$\n$$E_{Na} = 25.3 \\text{ mV} \\times (2.17475...)$$\n$$E_{Na} = +55.021... \\text{ mV}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the driving force on Na⁺ using our calculated $V_m'$ and $E_{Na}$:\n$$DF_{Na} = -48.636... \\text{ mV} - 55.021... \\text{ mV}$$\n$$DF_{Na} = -103.657... \\text{ mV}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the electrochemical driving force on sodium is $DF_{Na} = -104$ mV.
