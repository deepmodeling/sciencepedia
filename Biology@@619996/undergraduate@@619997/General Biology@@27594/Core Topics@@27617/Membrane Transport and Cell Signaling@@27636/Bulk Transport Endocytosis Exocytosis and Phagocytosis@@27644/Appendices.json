This first practice provides a quantitative model to explore the profound difference in efficiency between these two pathways. By calculating the number of growth factor molecules captured by each method in a single event, you will gain a concrete understanding of why RME is essential for internalizing scarce but vital molecules, demonstrating the power of concentrating a specific target at the cell surface before engulfment [@problem_id:2282700].", "problem": "A specific type of fibroblast in a culture medium requires the uptake of a growth factor to stimulate mitosis. The extracellular concentration of this growth factor is extremely low. The cell can internalize the growth factor through two primary mechanisms: non-specific pinocytosis (\"cell drinking\") and highly specific Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis (RME). To understand the dramatic difference in efficiency between these two processes, we will model a single endocytic event.\n\nAssume that both pinocytosis and RME produce spherical vesicles of the same diameter. The key difference is that in RME, the growth factor molecules first bind to receptors on the cell surface, which then cluster in a pit that invaginates to form the vesicle. This clustering mechanism effectively concentrates the growth factor from the extracellular medium.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- The extracellular concentration of the growth factor, $C_{out} = 2.50 \\times 10^{-11}$ M (moles per liter).\n- The uniform density of specific growth factor receptors on the fibroblast's plasma membrane, $\\sigma_R = 2000$ receptors/$\\mu\\text{m}^2$.\n- The diameter of a newly formed endocytic vesicle, $d = 120$ nm.\n- Avogadro's constant, $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23}$ mol$^{-1}$.\n\nFor your model, make the following simplifying assumptions:\n1. Endocytic vesicles are perfect spheres.\n2. For RME, the high affinity of the receptors ensures that all receptors located on the surface of the forming vesicle are bound to a growth factor molecule.\n3. The total number of molecules internalized by RME is the sum of those bound to receptors and those dissolved in the vesicle's fluid volume.\n\nCalculate the concentration factor, which is defined as the ratio of the total number of growth factor molecules internalized in a single RME vesicle to the number of molecules internalized in a single pinocytic vesicle of the same size.

For a spherical vesicle, the membrane area and enclosed volume are\n$$A=4\\pi r^{2},\\qquad V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}.$$\nPinocytosis internalizes only dissolved molecules, so the expected number of molecules per vesicle is\n$$n_{\\text{pino}}=C_{\\text{out}}\\,V_{\\text{L}}\\,N_{A},$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{L}}$ is the vesicle volume in liters.

This exercise delves into the elegant intracellular sorting mechanism of the transferrin cycle, a classic example of how cells manage this process following receptor-mediated endocytosis. By analyzing a hypothetical mutation that prevents the normal acidification of endosomes, you will explore the critical role that pH plays in dissociating cargo from its receptor, allowing the cell to deliver essential nutrients like iron while recycling the valuable receptor back to the surface for reuse [@problem_id:2282689].", "problem": "The cellular uptake of iron is a critical process, primarily mediated by the receptor-mediated endocytosis of the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex. In the extracellular fluid, which has a neutral pH of approximately 7.4, an iron-transporting protein called ferrotransferrin (Fe-Tf), which is transferrin bound to two $Fe^{3+}$ ions, binds with high affinity to the Transferrin Receptor (TfR) on the cell surface. This Fe-Tf-TfR complex is then internalized into the cell within an early endosome. In a normal cell, the endosome matures and its internal environment is acidified to a pH of approximately 5.5 by vacuolar-type H⁺-ATPase (V-ATPase) pumps. This acidic environment causes the $Fe^{3+}$ ions to dissociate from transferrin. The resulting iron-free transferrin, known as apotransferrin (apo-Tf), remains bound to the TfR at this acidic pH. The entire apo-Tf-TfR complex is then recycled back to the plasma membrane. Upon exposure to the neutral pH of the extracellular fluid, apo-Tf loses its affinity for the TfR and is released, leaving the receptor free to bind another molecule of Fe-Tf.\n\nConsider a hypothetical cell line with a genetic mutation that results in a complete loss of function of the V-ATPase pumps. In these cells, the pH of the endosomal lumen fails to decrease and remains at a neutral pH of ~7.4.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence of this mutation on the transferrin cycle?\n\nA. Ferrotransferrin will be unable to bind to the transferrin receptor on the cell surface, preventing endocytosis.\n\nB. The transferrin receptor and its bound ligand will be missorted and prematurely degraded in the lysosome.\n\nC. Apotransferrin will become trapped on the transferrin receptor within the endosome, preventing receptor recycling.\n\nD. The transferrin receptor will recycle to the cell surface, but will remain occupied by ferrotransferrin, thus failing to deliver iron to the cell.\n\nE. Iron will be successfully released into the endosome, but the apotransferrin-transferrin receptor complex will fail to recycle to the cell surface.", "solution": "Principles:\n- Transferrin-mediated iron uptake relies on pH-dependent affinity changes: at extracellular $pH \\approx 7.4$, ferrotransferrin (Fe-Tf) binds the transferrin receptor (TfR) with high affinity; at endosomal $pH \\approx 5.5$, $Fe^{3+}$ is released from transferrin, and apotransferrin (apo-Tf) remains bound to TfR; upon return to $pH \\approx 7.4$, apo-Tf loses affinity and dissociates.\n- V-ATPase acidifies endosomes; its loss prevents the $pH$ drop required for iron release from transferrin.\n- TfR primarily follows a constitutive recycling itinerary; pH governs ligand binding/release, not the basic recycling route.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n1) In the mutant cell, V-ATPase is nonfunctional; therefore, the endosomal lumen fails to acidify and remains at $pH \\approx 7.4$.\n2) At $pH \\approx 7.4$, Fe-Tf maintains high affinity for TfR, and transferrin does not undergo the conformational change needed to release $Fe^{3+}$. Thus, iron is not released in the endosome.\n3) Because $Fe^{3+}$ is not released, apo-Tf is not generated in the endosome. Therefore, the state in which apo-Tf remains bound to TfR at low pH cannot occur.\n4) The TfR-ligand complex continues along its normal recycling pathway back to the plasma membrane, since recycling is not strictly dependent on acidification for trafficking.\n5) Upon return to the cell surface at $pH \\approx 7.4$, Fe-Tf still has high affinity for TfR and thus remains bound, preventing both iron delivery to the cytosol and receptor availability for new Fe-Tf uptake.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is false: Fe-Tf binds TfR at $pH \\approx 7.4$.\n- B is unlikely: loss of acidification does not by itself induce missorting to lysosomes for degradation of TfR.\n- C is false: apo-Tf is not formed without acidification; moreover, recycling is not prevented.\n- D is correct: TfR recycles but remains occupied by Fe-Tf, failing to deliver iron.\n- E is false: iron is not released without acidification, and the complex still recycles.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is as described in D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2282689"}, {"introduction": "Beyond nutrient acquisition, bulk transport is central to immune defense. This final practice shifts our focus to phagocytosis, the process of \"cell eating\" used by immune cells like macrophages to engulf and destroy pathogens. You will work through a thought experiment where a hypothetical drug disrupts a critical step in this defensive pathway: the fusion of the vesicle containing the pathogen (the phagosome) with the cell's digestive organelle (the lysosome). This scenario highlights the importance of the complete, sequential pathway for effective immunity and provides insight into the real-world strategies that some pathogens use to survive inside our cells [@problem_id:2282715].", "problem": "An immunologist is investigating the effects of a novel experimental drug, \"Lysostatin,\" on macrophage function. Macrophages are specialized immune cells that engulf pathogens through a process called phagocytosis. In a controlled experiment, macrophages are treated with Lysostatin and then exposed to a species of pathogenic bacteria. The immunologist observes that the Lysostatin-treated macrophages are still able to successfully engulf the bacteria, forming intracellular vesicles known as phagosomes. However, further analysis reveals that Lysostatin's sole mechanism of action is to completely inhibit the fusion of these phagosomes with lysosomes.\n\nGiven this specific cellular disruption, which of the following statements describes the most probable immediate fate of a bacterium that has been engulfed by a Lysostatin-treated macrophage?\n\nA. The bacterium will be rapidly destroyed by powerful digestive enzymes that are pre-packaged within the newly formed phagosome.\n\nB. The bacterium will be recognized as undigested material and promptly expelled from the macrophage via exocytosis.\n\nC. The bacterium will survive and may potentially replicate within the protected environment of the phagosome.\n\nD. The phagosome membrane will quickly dissolve, releasing the bacterium into the macrophage's cytoplasm where it will be degraded by the acidic environment.\n\nE. The macrophage's internal sensors will detect the failed digestion and trigger immediate programmed cell death (apoptosis) of the macrophage itself, destroying the bacterium along with the host cell.", "solution": "Phagocytosis proceeds in two main stages: first, plasma membrane invagination engulfs the pathogen to form a phagosome; second, the phagosome undergoes maturation by fusing with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome. Fusion with lysosomes is required to deliver acid hydrolases, antimicrobial peptides, and to achieve sustained acidification via components contributed during maturation, enabling degradation of the engulfed microbe.\n\nBy stipulation, Lysostatin’s sole action is complete inhibition of phagosome–lysosome fusion. Therefore, the newly formed phagosome will not receive lysosomal hydrolases or other lysosomal contents needed for degradation. Consequently:\n- Option A is incorrect because phagosomes do not contain pre-packaged digestive enzymes sufficient for rapid destruction; these enzymes are supplied by lysosomes upon fusion.\n- Option B is unlikely because macrophages do not promptly expel undigested phagosomal contents by exocytosis as an immediate default response when digestion fails; the usual pathway is maturation and degradation.\n- Option C is the expected outcome: without phagolysosomal fusion and full maturation, many bacteria can survive within the relatively protected phagosomal compartment and, depending on the organism, may replicate, as exemplified by pathogens that naturally block phagosome–lysosome fusion.\n- Option D is incorrect because phagosomal membranes do not normally dissolve to release bacteria into the cytosol, and the cytosol is not acidic nor inherently degradative.\n- Option E is incorrect because immediate apoptosis is not a standard, direct consequence solely of failed phagosome–lysosome fusion; while prolonged infection can modulate cell death pathways, it is not the immediate fate described here.\n\nTherefore, the most probable immediate fate of an engulfed bacterium under these conditions is survival with potential replication within the phagosome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2282715"}]}
