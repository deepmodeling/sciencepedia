An inhibitory signal can prevent a neuron from firing not just by hyperpolarizing its membrane but also by 'shunting' excitatory currents, effectively making the neuron less responsive. This practice uses a hypothetical receptor mutation to illustrate how a prolonged inhibitory conductance can potently veto an otherwise effective excitatory stimulus, a key principle of synaptic integration. [@problem_id:2300372]", "id": "2300372", "problem": "In the central nervous system, the Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) receptor type A (GABA-A receptor) is a primary mediator of neuronal inhibition. It is a ligand-gated ion channel that, upon binding to the neurotransmitter GABA, opens a pore permeable to chloride ions (Cl⁻). In a typical mature neuron, the influx of negatively charged Cl⁻ ions causes the membrane potential to become more negative, a phenomenon known as hyperpolarization. This change in potential is an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP).\n\nConsider a neuron with a resting membrane potential of -70 mV and an action potential threshold of -55 mV. An action potential is an all-or-none electrical signal that is triggered only if the membrane potential reaches this threshold.\n\nA specific genetic mutation has been identified that alters the structure of the GABA-A receptor. This mutation does not affect GABA's ability to bind to the receptor or the ion selectivity of the channel. However, it significantly impairs the channel's closing mechanism, causing it to remain open for a much longer duration after GABA has bound, compared to a wild-type (normal) receptor.\n\nSuppose a neuron expressing these mutated GABA-A receptors first receives an inhibitory signal via GABA. Shortly thereafter, it receives a standard excitatory stimulus that, under normal circumstances (i.e., starting from the resting potential), would generate just enough depolarization to bring the membrane potential to the action potential threshold.\n\nBased on this scenario, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected response of the neuron to the excitatory stimulus?\n\nA. The neuron will be less likely to fire an action potential because the prolonged Cl⁻ influx will cause a greater or longer-lasting hyperpolarization, making it more difficult for the excitatory stimulus to reach the threshold.\nB. The neuron will be more likely to fire an action potential because the persistent channel opening will fatigue the inhibitory mechanism.\nC. The neuron's response will be unchanged because the excitatory stimulus is independent of the inhibitory signal's duration.\nD. The neuron will fire an action potential, but the peak amplitude of the action potential will be significantly reduced due to the concurrent Cl⁻ influx.\nE. The neuron will fire an action potential, but with a significant time delay as the excitatory potential slowly overcomes the inhibitory potential.\n\n", "solution": "We model the GABA-A receptor as a ligand-gated chloride channel that increases chloride conductance when open. The chloride current is given by the conductance-based relation\n$$\nI_{Cl} = g_{Cl}\\left(V_{m} - E_{Cl}\\right),\n$$\nso increasing $g_{Cl}$ drives $V_{m}$ toward $E_{Cl}$ and increases total membrane conductance. In a mature neuron, $E_{Cl}$ is at or more negative than $V_{\\text{rest}}$, so GABAergic activation produces an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) via hyperpolarization and shunting.\n\nThe mutation prolongs channel opening without changing binding or selectivity, so the effective $g_{Cl}$ remains elevated for longer. The total membrane conductance becomes\n$$\ng_{\\text{tot}} = g_{\\text{leak}} + g_{Cl},\n$$\nwhich lowers the input resistance\n$$\nR_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{1}{g_{\\text{tot}}}.\n$$\nBy Ohm’s law, for a given excitatory synaptic current $I_{E}$, the voltage deflection is\n$$\n\\Delta V = I_{E} R_{\\text{in}}.\n$$\nBecause $R_{\\text{in}}$ is reduced by the prolonged increase in $g_{Cl}$, the same excitatory input produces a smaller $\\Delta V$ (shunting inhibition). In addition, the membrane is held closer to $E_{Cl}$ and thus is more negative than $V_{\\text{rest}}$ at the time of the excitatory stimulus, so the required depolarization to reach threshold increases from $V_{\\text{th}} - V_{\\text{rest}}$ to $V_{\\text{th}} - V_{\\text{start}}$, with $V_{\\text{start}} < V_{\\text{rest}}$. Therefore,\n$$\nV_{m}^{\\text{after EPSP}} = V_{\\text{start}} + \\Delta V < V_{\\text{rest}} + \\Delta V_{\\text{normal}} \\leq V_{\\text{th}},\n$$\nwhere both the more negative $V_{\\text{start}}$ and the reduced $\\Delta V$ make reaching $V_{\\text{th}}$ less likely than under normal conditions.\n\nConsequently, the neuron is less likely to fire an action potential in the presence of the prolonged GABA-A receptor opening. This corresponds to a greater or longer-lasting hyperpolarization and shunting effect that makes it more difficult for the excitatory stimulus to reach threshold. Options suggesting unchanged response, increased likelihood due to fatigue, reduced spike amplitude, or merely delayed firing do not best capture the combined hyperpolarizing and shunting effects; if the neuron does not reach threshold, no action potential will occur at all.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}, {"introduction": "Synaptic signaling is not static; it is deeply intertwined with the metabolic health of the neuron. This advanced problem connects the dots between cellular energy ($ATP$), the active transport that maintains ion gradients, and the very nature of a synaptic response.

Its resting membrane potential is determined by the relative permeabilities and concentrations of sodium ($Na^+$), potassium ($K^+$), and chloride ($Cl^-$) ions.

In its healthy state, the neuron maintains the following intracellular concentrations: $[Na^+]_i = 10$ mM, $[K^+]_i = 140$ mM, and $[Cl^-]_i = 7$ mM.

This failure leads to a shift in intracellular ion concentrations. The change in the primary cations is such that the intracellular potassium concentration decreases by 25 mM, and this loss is exactly balanced by an increase in intracellular sodium concentration of 25 mM. Due to the failure of chloride extrusion mechanisms, the intracellular chloride concentration, $[Cl^-]_i$, begins to rise from its initial value.\n\nAssuming the extracellular concentrations and relative membrane permeabilities remain constant, and the experiment is conducted at a temperature where the term $RT/F$ in the Nernst and Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equations equals $26.7$ mV, determine the value of the intracellular chloride concentration at which the response of the neuron to GABA transitions from being hyperpolarizing to depolarizing.
