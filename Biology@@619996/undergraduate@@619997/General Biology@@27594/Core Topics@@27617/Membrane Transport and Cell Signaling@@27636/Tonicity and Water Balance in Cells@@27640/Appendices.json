An experiment is prepared using a raw chicken egg. First, the egg is soaked in a vinegar solution for 48 hours to completely dissolve its hard, calcium carbonate shell, leaving the soft, selectively permeable membrane surrounding the albumen (egg white) and yolk intact. The initial mass of this de-shelled egg is carefully measured. Subsequently, the egg is completely submerged in a beaker filled with a large volume of commercial corn syrup, which is a highly concentrated aqueous solution of various sugars.

The membrane is permeable to water but impermeable to the large sugar molecules in corn syrup. Therefore, the relevant driving force is the difference in water chemical potential (or equivalently water potential) across the membrane.\n\nLet the outside (corn syrup) have solute concentration $C_{\\text{out}}$ and the inside (egg contents) have solute concentration $C_{\\text{in}}$, with $C_{\\text{out}} \\gg C_{\\text{in}}$ because commercial corn syrup is highly concentrated. For an ideal dilute solute, the osmotic pressure is given by the van 't Hoff relation\n$$\n\\Pi = i R T C,\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the van 't Hoff factor for the solute, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $C$ is the solute concentration. Since sugars are non-electrolytes, $i$ is constant and does not change the inequality. Thus\n$$\n\\Pi_{\\text{out}} = i R T C_{\\text{out}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Pi_{\\text{in}} = i R T C_{\\text{in}},\n$$\nwith $\\Pi_{\\text{out}} > \\Pi_{\\text{in}}$.\n\nThe net volumetric water flux across a semipermeable membrane can be expressed as\n$$\nJ_{w} = L_{p}\\left(\\Delta P - \\Delta \\Pi\\right),\n$$\nwhere $L_{p}$ is the hydraulic conductivity, $\\Delta P = P_{\\text{out}} - P_{\\text{in}}$ is the hydrostatic pressure difference, and $\\Delta \\Pi = \\Pi_{\\text{out}} - \\Pi_{\\text{in}}$ is the osmotic pressure difference. Immediately after immersion, $\\Delta P \\approx 0$ and $\\Delta \\Pi > 0$, so\n$$\nJ_{w} = L_{p}\\left(0 - (\\Pi_{\\text{out}} - \\Pi_{\\text{in}})\\right)  0,\n$$\nwhich, with the convention that positive $J_{w}$ is inward, means water flows out of the egg into the syrup.\n\nEquivalently, in terms of water potential $\\Psi_{w} = \\Psi_{p} + \\Psi_{s}$, where $\\Psi_{p}$ is pressure potential and $\\Psi_{s}$ is solute potential (with $\\Psi_{s}  0$ and more negative at higher solute concentration), we have\n$$\n\\Psi_{w,\\text{out}} = \\Psi_{p,\\text{out}} + \\Psi_{s,\\text{out}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Psi_{w,\\text{in}} = \\Psi_{p,\\text{in}} + \\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}.\n$$\nBecause $|\\Psi_{s,\\text{out}}| \\gg |\\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}|$, we have $\\Psi_{w,\\text{out}}  \\Psi_{w,\\text{in}}$, so water moves from inside to outside until equilibrium is approached.\n\nAs water leaves the egg:\n- The mass of the egg decreases because water constitutes a substantial portion of its mass and is the only component crossing the membrane.\n- The loss of internal water reduces turgor (pressure potential), causing the membrane to become slack and the egg to appear shrunken and flaccid.\n\nNo fermentation-driven gas production is expected under these conditions, and the selectively permeable membrane does not dissolve in corn syrup.
