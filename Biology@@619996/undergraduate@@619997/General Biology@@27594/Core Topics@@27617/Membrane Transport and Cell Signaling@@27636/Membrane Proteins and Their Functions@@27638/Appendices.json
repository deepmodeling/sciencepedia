Structural and functional studies reveal that SerT operates via the \"alternating access model.\" In this model, the transporter exposes a substrate-binding site to one side of the membrane (outward-facing), binds L-serine, and then undergoes a large conformational change to an \"occluded\" state where the substrate is not accessible from either side. Finally, it transitions to an \"inward-facing\" conformation to release the substrate into the cytoplasm before resetting. A critical part of this conformational change involves the rocking motion of transmembrane alpha-helix 7 (TM7). Sequence alignments with homologous transporters show a universally conserved glycine residue at position 284 (G284) located in the middle of TM7, which appears to function as a molecular hinge facilitating this rocking motion.\n\nA site-directed mutagenesis experiment is performed, creating a mutant version of the protein, G284W, where the glycine at position 284 is replaced by a tryptophan. Assuming the mutant protein is correctly folded and inserted into the plasma membrane, which of the following statements describes the most likely direct consequence of this mutation on the transporter's functional cycle?\n\nA. The transporter's maximum transport rate ($V_{\\text{max}}$) for L-serine will be significantly increased.\n\nB. The transporter will be functionally locked or severely impaired in its ability to transition between the outward-facing and inward-facing states.\n\nC. The transporter will lose its specificity and begin transporting other larger amino acids in addition to L-serine.\n\nD. The affinity of the transporter for L-serine (inversely related to $K_m$) will increase dramatically, but $V_{\\text{max}}$ will remain unaffected.\n\nE. The G284W mutation will convert the uniporter into an active transporter that requires ATP hydrolysis to function.", "solution": "We analyze the transporter’s mechanism and the structural role of residue G284, then infer kinetic consequences of the G284W mutation.\n\n1) Mechanistic framework: In an alternating access transporter, the catalytic cycle consists of substrate binding to an outward-facing conformation, transition to an occluded state, transition to an inward-facing conformation, substrate release, and reset. The turnover number $k_{\\text{cat}}$ (and thus $V_{\\text{max}} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{tot}}$) is controlled by the slowest elementary step, which commonly includes large conformational changes that interconvert outward-facing, occluded, and inward-facing states.\n\n2) Structural role of G284: The universally conserved glycine at position 284 in TM7 is proposed to be a molecular hinge that enables the rocking motion of TM7. Glycine’s lack of a side chain (beyond hydrogen) minimizes steric hindrance and allows a broader range of backbone dihedral angles, facilitating helix kinking and rocking that are required to traverse outward-facing, occluded, and inward-facing conformations. This conservation implies strong functional selection for local flexibility at this position.\n\n3) Effect of G to W substitution at the hinge: Replacing glycine with tryptophan introduces a large, bulky, and rigid side chain at the hinge. This has two direct consequences:\n- It reduces local backbone conformational flexibility by introducing steric bulk, thereby disfavoring the bending/kinking required for the hinge motion.\n- It increases the likelihood of steric clashes with neighboring helices/lipids and stabilizes one conformational basin over others, raising the energetic barrier between conformations.\n\n4) Kinetic consequence of an increased conformational barrier: The rate of a conformational transition can be expressed using transition state theory as\n$$\nk_{\\text{conf}} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{h}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conf}}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conf}}$ is the free-energy barrier for the conformational change. Introducing tryptophan at the hinge increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conf}}$, thereby decreasing $k_{\\text{conf}}$. If this conformational step is rate-limiting, then $k_{\\text{cat}}$ decreases and $V_{\\text{max}}$ decreases; in extreme cases the transporter becomes kinetically trapped (“locked”) in one conformation (e.g., outward-facing) or toggles so slowly as to be severely impaired.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A (increased $V_{\\text{max}}$): Contradicted by increased $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conf}}$ at the hinge; $k_{\\text{cat}}$ would decrease, not increase.\n- B (locked or severely impaired transitions): Matches the predicted increase in conformational barrier due to loss of hinge flexibility and steric hindrance at TM7.\n- C (loss of specificity to transport larger amino acids): Substrate specificity is primarily determined by the binding site architecture, not a distant hinge; introducing a bulky residue does not enlarge the binding site and is unlikely to broaden specificity to larger substrates.\n- D (dramatic increase in affinity with unchanged $V_{\\text{max}}$): A hinge mutation chiefly affects conformational transitions and thus $k_{\\text{cat}}$ and $V_{\\text{max}}$, not specifically the binding affinity; unchanged $V_{\\text{max}}$ is inconsistent with increased conformational barriers.\n- E (conversion to ATP-dependent active transport): Introducing ATP dependence requires an energy-coupling domain and binding/hydrolysis machinery; a single point mutation at a hinge cannot create ATP-driven transport.\n\nTherefore, the most likely direct consequence is impaired alternating access due to hindered TM7 rocking, leading to functional locking or severe impairment of conformational transitions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2302642"}, {"introduction": "Ion channels are remarkably sophisticated filters, capable of distinguishing between ions that are nearly identical in size.

Genetic analysis reveals a point mutation in the *SCN4A* gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the skeletal muscle fiber's primary voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.4. Further biophysical characterization of the mutated channel shows that its primary defect is a significantly slowed rate of transition from the 'open' state to the 'inactivated' state following membrane depolarization. While the channel still opens normally in response to a threshold voltage, it remains open for a longer duration before inactivating.\n\nAssuming all other cellular components, including motor neurons, the neuromuscular junction, and other ion channels, function normally, which of the following statements provides the most accurate physiological explanation for the observed muscle weakness during an episode of paralysis?\n\nA. The prolonged opening of mutated channels creates a persistent, small inward sodium current that maintains the muscle fiber membrane in a partially depolarized state. This sustained depolarization holds the majority of surrounding normal sodium channels in an inactivated conformation, rendering the muscle fiber electrically inexcitable to further neuronal stimulation.\n\nB. The constant influx of sodium through the faulty channels requires the $Na^+/K^+-ATPase$ pump to work excessively. This depletes the muscle cell's entire supply of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), preventing the myosin heads from detaching from actin filaments and causing the muscle to become locked in a rigid, contracted state.\n\nC. The delayed inactivation of sodium channels leads to a prolonged action potential duration. This causes an over-accumulation of potassium ions in the synaptic cleft, which hyperpolarizes the postsynaptic membrane and significantly raises the threshold for firing a subsequent action potential.\n\nD. The persistent sodium influx completely reverses the charge across the muscle fiber membrane, causing it to become positively charged at rest. This positive potential \"repels\" the positively charged acetylcholine neurotransmitters released by the motor neuron, preventing them from binding to their receptors.\n\nE. The abnormal sodium channel function directly interferes with the voltage-sensing Dihydropyridine Receptors (DHPRs) in the T-tubules, preventing them from signaling the Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
