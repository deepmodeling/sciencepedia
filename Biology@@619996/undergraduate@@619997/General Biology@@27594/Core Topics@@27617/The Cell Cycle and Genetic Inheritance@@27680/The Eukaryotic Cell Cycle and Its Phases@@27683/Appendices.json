{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The decision to enter mitosis from the G2 phase is a fundamental switch in a cell's life. This transition is driven by the M-phase Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (M-Cdk), but its activity is tightly restrained to allow the cell sufficient time to grow. This problem [@problem_id:2319608] allows you to explore the consequence of removing one of these molecular \"brakes,\" giving you a clear insight into the core regulatory logic that couples cell growth with cell division.", "problem": "In the eukaryotic cell cycle, the transition from the G2 phase to the M (mitotic) phase is a critical, tightly regulated event. The primary driver of this transition is a protein complex formed between M-cyclin and a Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK) known as Cdk1. The activity of this Cdk1/M-cyclin complex is controlled by phosphorylation. A kinase called Wee1 adds an inhibitory phosphate group to Cdk1, holding the complex in an inactive state during G2. This allows the cell to grow and prepare for division. When the cell is ready, a phosphatase called Cdc25 removes the inhibitory phosphate, leading to the activation of the Cdk1/M-cyclin complex and entry into mitosis.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered cell line in which the endogenous Cdk1 gene has been replaced with a mutant version. This mutant Cdk1 protein is fully capable of binding to M-cyclin and phosphorylating its downstream targets, but it lacks the specific amino acid residue that is normally phosphorylated by the Wee1 kinase. Assuming that the synthesis and degradation of M-cyclin, and the function of all other cell cycle proteins, remain normal, which of the following outcomes is the most probable phenotype for this mutant cell line when compared to a wild-type (non-mutant) population?\n\nA. The mutant cells will arrest in the G2 phase and fail to enter mitosis.\n\nB. The mutant cells will spend a longer time in the G2 phase, causing them to grow to an unusually large size before dividing.\n\nC. The mutant cells will enter mitosis prematurely, causing them to divide at a smaller size.\n\nD. The mutant cells will arrest in the S phase due to defects in DNA replication.\n\nE. The mutant Cdk1 protein will cause an increase in the rate of DNA polymerase activity, shortening the S phase.", "solution": "The G2 to M transition is governed by the activity of the $\\text{Cdk1/M-cyclin}$ complex. In wild-type cells, Wee1 kinase phosphorylates a specific inhibitory site on Cdk1 during G2, keeping the complex inactive despite cyclin accumulation. Activation requires removal of this inhibitory phosphate by Cdc25 phosphatase, producing a switch-like entry into mitosis once the cell has grown sufficiently and checkpoints are satisfied.\n\nIn the engineered mutant, Cdk1 lacks the specific amino acid residue that is phosphorylated by Wee1. Therefore, Wee1 cannot add the inhibitory phosphate and cannot restrain the $\\text{Cdk1/M-cyclin}$ complex. The mutant Cdk1 is stated to be fully capable of binding M-cyclin and phosphorylating downstream targets, so the complex is catalytically competent. With normal M-cyclin synthesis and degradation, as M-cyclin accumulates during G2, the $\\text{Cdk1/M-cyclin}$ complex will become active earlier than in wild type because the inhibitory arm (Wee1-dependent phosphorylation) is absent, and activation does not await Cdc25-dependent dephosphorylation. The positive-feedback loop in which active Cdk1 further inhibits Wee1 and activates Cdc25 would further favor early activation once any activity is present.\n\nThe physiological consequence of removing Wee1-mediated inhibition is a shortened G2 phase and premature entry into mitosis at a smaller cell size, matching the classic phenotype of Wee1 loss-of-function. This excludes options involving G2 arrest or prolongation, which require intact inhibitory phosphorylation (A and B), and excludes S-phase defects (D and E), because the mutation specifically affects the G2/M regulatory switch and does not increase DNA polymerase activity.\n\nTherefore, the most probable phenotype is premature mitotic entry with division at a smaller size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2319608"}, {"introduction": "Once a cell enters mitosis, it faces another critical checkpoint: ensuring that sister chromatids separate only after every chromosome is correctly attached to the mitotic spindle. The irreversible transition into anaphase is guarded by multiple layers of regulation. This exercise [@problem_id:2319637] asks you to predict the outcome when a key inhibitor of this transition, securin, cannot be removed, providing a hands-on understanding of how timed protein degradation is essential for chromosomal fidelity.", "problem": "In a cell biology research laboratory, a team of scientists has engineered a novel mutant cell line to study mitotic regulation. In these cells, a genetic modification has been introduced that alters the structure of the securin protein. This modification makes the securin protein completely resistant to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC), a key regulatory E3 ubiquitin ligase. However, the mutant securin protein is otherwise fully functional, meaning it can still bind to and inhibit its target enzyme, separase.\n\nAssuming these mutant cells are supplied with all necessary growth factors and nutrients to enter and proceed through the cell cycle, and that all other cellular components and checkpoints are functioning normally, which of the following options describes the most direct and immediate fate of a cell as it attempts mitosis?\n\nA. The cell will arrest in metaphase, as the sister chromatids cannot be separated to initiate anaphase.\n\nB. The cell will arrest in prophase, as the securin mutation prevents the proper condensation of chromosomes.\n\nC. The cell will proceed through anaphase and telophase but will fail at cytokinesis, producing a single binucleated, tetraploid cell.\n\nD. The cell will fail to align its chromosomes at the metaphase plate, leading to an arrest due to an active spindle assembly checkpoint.\n\nE. The cell will enter anaphase prematurely, leading to a high rate of chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy.", "solution": "Key regulatory principle: the metaphase-to-anaphase transition requires activation of separase. Under normal conditions, the Anaphase-Promoting Complex bound to Cdc20 polyubiquitinates cyclin B and securin. Degradation of securin releases separase from inhibition. Active separase cleaves the kleisin subunit of cohesin (e.g., Scc1/Rad21), thereby dissolving sister chromatid cohesion and initiating anaphase.\n\nIn the described mutant, securin is fully functional in binding and inhibiting separase but is completely resistant to ubiquitination and degradation by the APC. Therefore, even if the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied (all kinetochores properly attached and under tension, allowing APC activation), securin will not be degraded. Consequently, separase remains inhibited, cohesin remains intact, and sister chromatids cannot separate. Chromosomes can still align at the metaphase plate because biorientation and tension do not require separase activity; thus the immediate block is not in alignment but in the onset of anaphase. Therefore, the most direct and immediate fate is arrest at metaphase due to failure to separate sister chromatids.\n\nThis excludes:\n- B: securin does not regulate chromosome condensation in prophase.\n- C: anaphase cannot proceed without separase, so cytokinesis failure is not the primary immediate outcome.\n- D: alignment can occur; the spindle checkpoint need not remain active if attachments are correct.\n- E: the outcome is delayed, not premature, anaphase onset.\n\nHence, the correct option is metaphase arrest due to an inability to initiate anaphase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2319637"}, {"introduction": "The spindle assembly checkpoint can halt the cell cycle in metaphase to prevent errors, a mechanism often exploited by chemotherapy drugs. But what happens if this arrest is prolonged? This problem [@problem_id:2319594] introduces a quantitative model for \"mitotic slippage,\" a process where cells eventually exit mitosis without dividing. By applying a simple linear model, you can calculate the timing of this escape, connecting molecular concentrations to a critical cell fate decision.", "problem": "A research team is studying a line of cancer cells that are particularly sensitive to microtubule-targeting drugs. The cells are synchronized and induced to enter mitosis at time $t=0$. Immediately upon mitotic entry, the culture is treated with a drug that disrupts microtubule dynamics, leading to the activation of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) and a complete arrest in a metaphase-like state.\n\nProgression through mitosis and its subsequent exit are primarily controlled by the concentration of Cyclin B. To enter and maintain the mitotic state, the concentration of Cyclin B must be above a critical threshold. Mitotic exit, which normally occurs via rapid degradation of Cyclin B mediated by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), is blocked by the active SAC.\n\nHowever, prolonged mitotic arrest can lead to a phenomenon called \"mitotic slippage,\" where the cell exits mitosis without cell division. This is thought to occur because, despite the SAC-mediated inhibition of the APC/C, there is a slow, constant net rate of Cyclin B degradation that gradually lowers its concentration.\n\nAssume the following for this cell line:\n- The initial concentration of Cyclin B at the onset of mitosis ($t=0$) is $[C_B]_0 = 100$ nM.\n- A cell will exit mitosis (undergo slippage) if the concentration of Cyclin B drops to or below the mitotic exit threshold, $[C_B]_{exit} = 25$ nM.\n- During the drug-induced mitotic arrest, the net rate of Cyclin B degradation is constant, with a value of $R_{net\\_deg} = 3.125$ nM/hour.\n\nCalculate the time it will take for these arrested cells to begin undergoing mitotic slippage.
