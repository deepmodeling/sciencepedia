{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding mitosis requires not just knowing the sequence of stages, but also mastering the quantitative changes in genetic material. This first practice problem challenges you to track both the chromosome number and the total mass of DNA within a cell as it progresses from the G1 phase of interphase into anaphase. Properly solving this requires a clear distinction between a chromosome and a chromatid, which is a fundamental concept in all of genetics and cell biology [@problem_id:2303615].", "problem": "A developmental biologist is studying the cell division cycle in a newly discovered species of diploid parasitic fungus. A single somatic cell is isolated during the G1 phase of interphase. Through cytogenetic analysis, it is determined that this G1 cell contains a total of 12 chromosomes. The total mass of its nuclear Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is precisely measured to be $M$. Later, the biologist observes another cell from the same fungal culture that is clearly in the anaphase stage of mitosis.\n\nAssuming no mutations or errors have occurred during the cell cycle, which of the following pairs correctly represents the total number of chromosomes and the total mass of nuclear DNA within this single cell during anaphase?\n\nA. 12 chromosomes, DNA mass $M$\n\nB. 12 chromosomes, DNA mass $2M$\n\nC. 24 chromosomes, DNA mass $M$\n\nD. 24 chromosomes, DNA mass $2M$\n\nE. 24 chromosomes, DNA mass $4M$", "solution": "Let $C$ denote the number of chromosomes in a somatic cell during G1 and let the total nuclear DNA mass at G1 be $M$. The problem states $C=12$ and DNA mass $=M$ for a G1 cell.\n\nKey principles:\n- Chromosome number is defined by the number of centromeres; sister chromatids connected at a single centromere still constitute one chromosome.\n- DNA replication during S phase doubles the DNA content but does not change chromosome number.\n- During anaphase, sister chromatids separate; once separated, each chromatid (now with its own centromere) is counted as an individual chromosome.\n- No DNA synthesis or degradation occurs during mitosis past S phase, so total DNA mass remains constant through prophase, metaphase, and anaphase until cytokinesis partitions it.\n\nApply these principles step by step:\n1. G1: By definition, $C=12$ and DNA mass $=M$.\n2. Post-S phase (G2 and metaphase): Chromosome number remains $C=12$; DNA mass doubles to $2M$ because replication has occurred.\n3. Anaphase: Sister chromatids separate, doubling the chromosome count within the single cell. Therefore, chromosome number becomes $2C=24$. Because there is no change in total DNA quantity during chromatid separation, the DNA mass remains $2M$.\n4. After cytokinesis (not asked, but for completeness): Each daughter cell returns to $C=12$ and DNA mass $M$.\n\nTherefore, during anaphase in the single mitotic cell, the correct pair is $24$ chromosomes and DNA mass $2M$, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2303615"}, {"introduction": "The transition between mitotic stages is not automatic; it is tightly regulated by complex molecular machinery. This exercise shifts our focus from observation to mechanism, exploring what happens when a key enzyme, separase, is inhibited [@problem_id:2303642]. By predicting the outcome of this molecular intervention, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the spindle assembly checkpoint and the biochemical logic that ensures chromosomes are segregated with high fidelity.", "problem": "In a research project aimed at developing novel anti-cancer therapies, a biologist is studying a compound called \"Separinhib.\" This drug is designed to specifically and completely block the enzymatic activity of separase, a protease crucial for cell cycle progression. The biologist treats a synchronized culture of healthy, rapidly dividing mammalian cells with a high concentration of Separinhib. Before treatment, the cells were all progressing normally through the cell cycle. Assuming the drug has no other off-target effects and can readily enter the cells, at which stage would you expect the majority of cells in this culture to arrest their progression through mitosis?\n\nA. Prophase, as the chromosomes will be unable to condense.\n\nB. At the transition from metaphase to anaphase, with chromosomes aligned at the equatorial plate.\n\nC. Anaphase, as the spindle microtubules will be unable to shorten.\n\nD. Telophase, as the nuclear envelope will fail to re-form around the decondensing chromosomes.\n\nE. Cytokinesis, as the contractile ring will be unable to form.", "solution": "Separase is a cysteine protease whose essential mitotic function is to cleave the kleisin subunit of cohesin complexes that hold sister chromatids together at centromeres. The physiological sequence at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition is:\n- Proper bioriented kinetochore-microtubule attachments generate tension at metaphase.\n- The spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied, permitting activation of APC/C-Cdc20.\n- APC/C-Cdc20 targets securin and cyclin B for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis; degradation of securin unleashes separase activity.\n- Activated separase cleaves cohesin, thereby eliminating sister chromatid cohesion; only then can anaphase A (poleward chromosome movement via kinetochore microtubule depolymerization) and anaphase B (spindle elongation) proceed.\n\nIf separase enzymatic activity is specifically and completely inhibited, the key consequence is that cohesin at centromeres cannot be cleaved. Therefore:\n- Chromosome condensation in prophase is unaffected because it depends primarily on condensin, not separase, so option A is incorrect.\n- Cells can establish bioriented attachments and align chromosomes at the metaphase plate, but without cohesin cleavage, sister chromatids remain physically linked and cannot move to opposite poles. Thus cells fail precisely at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, accumulating with chromosomes aligned at the equatorial plate, matching option B.\n- Microtubule dynamics (shortening in anaphase A) are not directly impaired by separase inhibition; the block is the persistence of cohesion, so option C is incorrect.\n- Telophase events such as nuclear envelope re-formation occur after successful chromatid separation and mitotic exit; the block occurs earlier, so option D is incorrect.\n- Cytokinesis requires prior chromosome segregation and mitotic exit signaling; the arrest occurs before cytokinesis, so option E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the majority of cells arrest at the transition from metaphase to anaphase with chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2303642"}, {"introduction": "Mitosis, the division of the nucleus, is typically followed by cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm. While often synchronized, these are two distinct processes, and this scenario explores what happens when one fails [@problem_id:2303577]. By analyzing a hypothetical situation where nuclear division (karyokinesis) proceeds normally but cytokinesis is blocked, you will solidify your understanding of these key events and their relationship.", "problem": "A research group is investigating a novel compound, \"Inhibitin-C,\" for its effects on the cell cycle. They add the compound to a culture of normal human diploid somatic cells and observe them using time-lapse microscopy. The researchers find that Inhibitin-C has a highly specific effect: it allows cells to successfully complete all stages of nuclear division (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase) with perfect chromosome segregation, but it completely and specifically blocks the process of cytokinesis.\n\nConsider a single human somatic cell from this culture that enters mitosis in the presence of Inhibitin-C. Assuming the cell was diploid and in the G1 phase before the cycle began, which of the following options most accurately describes the direct and immediate cellular state upon completion of one round of mitosis?\n\nA. A single cell containing two genetically identical diploid nuclei.\n\nB. A single cell containing one large tetraploid nucleus.\n\nC. Two distinct daughter cells, one of which contains a diploid nucleus and the other is an anucleated cytoplast.\n\nD. The cell arrests at the anaphase-telophase transition and cannot form new nuclear envelopes.\n\nE. Two genetically identical diploid cells that are unable to separate and remain fused by a permanent cytoplasmic bridge.", "solution": "Start with the stated initial condition: a normal human somatic cell in G1 is diploid, with chromosome number $2n$ and DNA content $2C$. Prior to mitosis, the cell passes through S phase, during which DNA replication doubles the DNA content without changing chromosome number, yielding $2n$ chromosomes each composed of two sister chromatids (DNA content $4C$).\n\nUpon entering mitosis (M phase), karyokinesis proceeds through prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The problem states that Inhibitin-C allows cells to complete all stages of nuclear division with perfect chromosome segregation. Therefore, at anaphase, sister chromatids separate accurately, and by telophase, two sets of chromosomes are partitioned to opposite poles. Nuclear envelope re-formation around each set produces two distinct nuclei, each with a diploid chromosome number $2n$ and DNA content $2C$ (after completion of telophase and decondensation).\n\nThe compound specifically and completely blocks cytokinesis, the physical division of the cytoplasm. Thus, while two genetically identical diploid nuclei are formed, the cleavage furrow does not complete to produce two separate daughter cells. The immediate post-mitotic state is a single cell (one continuous cytoplasm) containing two nuclei, i.e., a binucleated cell.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A matches this state: one cell with two genetically identical diploid nuclei.\n- B would require failure of karyokinesis or nuclear fusion to yield a single tetraploid ($4n$) nucleus, which contradicts the stated perfect completion of nuclear division.\n- C implies asymmetric division producing one anucleate cytoplast and one nucleated cell, which requires cytokinesis; cytokinesis is blocked, so two separate cells do not form.\n- D contradicts the stated completion of telophase and nuclear division.\n- E describes two distinct cells remaining connected by a cytoplasmic bridge (abscission failure). Here, cytokinesis is completely blocked, so there are not two distinct cells; instead there is one binucleated cell.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is a single cell containing two genetically identical diploid nuclei.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2303577"}]}
