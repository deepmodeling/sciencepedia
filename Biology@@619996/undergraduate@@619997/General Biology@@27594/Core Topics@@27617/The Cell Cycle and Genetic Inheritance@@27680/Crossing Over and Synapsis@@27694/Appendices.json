{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before delving into the genetic consequences of crossing over, it's essential to have a firm grasp of the structures involved during prophase I of meiosis. This exercise provides a foundational check on your understanding of synapsis, the process where homologous chromosomes pair up to form structures called bivalents. By working backward from the number of observable bivalents in a cell, you can determine the organism's complete diploid chromosome number ($2n$), a critical piece of information for any genetic analysis [@problem_id:2288872].", "problem": "A team of botanists is studying the reproductive viability of a newly created hybrid orchid species. For the hybrid to be fertile and produce viable seeds through sexual reproduction, it must undergo meiosis correctly. The researchers prepare microscope slides of the orchid's microspore mother cells, which are the cells that undergo meiosis to produce pollen. During their analysis, they focus on cells in Prophase I of meiosis. In this stage, homologous chromosomes pair up via a process called synapsis, forming structures known as bivalents. After examining numerous cells, the team consistently observes 12 distinct bivalents within the nucleus of each cell entering meiosis.\n\nBased on this observation, what is the diploid chromosome number ($2n$) for this hybrid orchid species?\n\nA. 6\n\nB. 12\n\nC. 24\n\nD. 48\n\nE. 36", "solution": "Microspore mother cells are diploid and undergo meiosis. In Prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair by synapsis to form bivalents, where each bivalent consists of one pair of homologous chromosomes. Therefore, the number of bivalents observed equals the haploid chromosome number, denoted $n$.\n\nGiven that 12 bivalents are observed, we have $n=12$. The diploid chromosome number is $2n$, so:\n$$\n2n = 2 \\times n = 2 \\times 12 = 24.\n$$\nAmong the options, this corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2288872"}, {"introduction": "Crossing over is not an abstract concept but a physical exchange of DNA segments between homologous chromosomes. This thought experiment helps you visualize this intricate molecular dance by using a hypothetical scenario with fluorescently tagged chromosomes [@problem_id:2288919]. By tracing the fate of the maternal and paternal chromatids through a single crossover event, you will build a clear mental model of how recombinant chromatids are generated, clarifying which strands participate and the hybrid nature of the resulting bivalent.", "problem": "In a developmental biology laboratory, researchers are studying the process of meiosis in a genetically engineered organism. They have tagged a specific pair of homologous chromosomes with fluorescent markers. The chromosome inherited from the maternal parent carries a gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), causing it to glow bright green under specific lighting conditions. The homologous chromosome inherited from the paternal parent carries a gene for Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), causing it to glow red.\n\nA germline cell from this organism, containing this pair of tagged chromosomes, is observed as it enters meiosis. It is known that after DNA replication and the pairing of homologous chromosomes in prophase I, a single crossover event occurs at a location approximately one-quarter of the way from the end of one arm of the paired chromosomes.\n\nAssuming the cell is viewed with a fluorescence microscope just before the start of anaphase I, which of the following statements most accurately describes the appearance of the resulting bivalent structure?\n\nA. The bivalent consists of two chromatids. One chromatid is mostly green with a red segment at its end, and the homologous chromatid is mostly red with a green segment at its end.\n\nB. The bivalent consists of four chromatids: two are entirely green and two are entirely red, with no mixing of colors observed.\n\nC. The bivalent consists of four chromatids. One chromatid is entirely green, one chromatid is entirely red, one chromatid is mostly green with a red segment at its end, and one chromatid is mostly red with a green segment at its end.\n\nD. The bivalent consists of four chromatids. All four chromatids appear as mosaics, each containing multiple, alternating segments of green and red fluorescence.\n\nE. The bivalent consists of four chromatids, all of which fluoresce a uniform yellow-orange color, indicating a complete fusion and mixing of the GFP and RFP molecules.", "solution": "To determine the appearance of the bivalent, we must trace the state of the chromosomes through the initial stages of meiosis.\n\n**Initial State:** Before meiosis begins, the diploid cell has one green-tagged maternal chromosome and one red-tagged paternal homologous chromosome.\n\n**Step 1: DNA Replication (Interphase before Meiosis I)**\nBefore meiosis I, the cell undergoes the S phase of interphase, where all DNA is replicated. The green maternal chromosome replicates to form two identical sister chromatids, which are both entirely green and joined at a centromere. Similarly, the red paternal chromosome replicates to form two identical sister chromatids, which are both entirely red.\n\n**Step 2: Synapsis (Prophase I)**\nDuring prophase I of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes pair up in a process called synapsis. The replicated green chromosome (consisting of two green sister chromatids) aligns with the replicated red chromosome (consisting of two red sister chromatids). This paired structure of four chromatids is called a bivalent or a tetrad. At this point, before any crossing over, the bivalent consists of two purely green chromatids and two purely red chromatids.\n\n**Step 3: Crossing Over (Prophase I)**\nThe problem states that a single crossover event occurs. A crucial principle of meiosis is that crossing over involves the exchange of genetic material between **non-sister chromatids** within a homologous pair. It does not occur between sister chromatids (e.g., between the two green chromatids).\n\nTherefore, one of the green chromatids will break and exchange a segment with one of the red chromatids. The other green chromatid and the other red chromatid are not involved in this specific exchange.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Resulting Chromatids**\nLet's analyze the composition of the four chromatids after this single crossover event:\n1.  **One Sister Chromatid (Maternal):** This chromatid was not involved in the crossover. It remains entirely green.\n2.  **The Other Sister Chromatid (Maternal):** This chromatid was involved in the crossover. It is now a recombinant chromatid. Since it exchanged its end segment with the red chromatid, it will be mostly green with a red segment at its end.\n3.  **One Sister Chromatid (Paternal):** This chromatid was not involved in the crossover. It remains entirely red.\n4.  **The Other Sister Chromatid (Paternal):** This chromatid was involved in the crossover. It is the reciprocal recombinant chromatid. It gave its red end segment to the green chromatid and received a green end segment in return. Therefore, it will be mostly red with a green segment at its end.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe bivalent, viewed just before anaphase I, is a structure composed of these four chromatids held together by centromeres (linking sister chromatids) and the chiasma (the physical site of crossing over). The structure contains: one entirely green chromatid, one entirely red chromatid, one mostly green chromatid with a red tip, and one mostly red chromatid with a green tip. This description perfectly matches option C.\n\nLet's evaluate the incorrect options:\n-   **A** is incorrect because it ignores the DNA replication step, describing a bivalent with only two chromatids instead of four.\n-   **B** is incorrect because it describes the state *before* crossing over has occurred, or what would happen if the crossover occurred between sister chromatids, which is not the function of meiotic crossing over.\n-   **D** is incorrect as it implies multiple crossover events occurred along all chromatids, contrary to the problem statement of a *single* crossover event.\n-   **E** is incorrect because it reflects a misunderstanding of the physical process. The fluorescent proteins are attached to the chromosome structure; they do not detach and mix like liquids. The exchange is of large DNA segments, not a molecular-level blending of proteins.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2288919"}, {"introduction": "The frequency of crossing over between two linked genes on a chromosome is a powerful tool for geneticists, allowing them to deduce the relative distance between the genes.
