This exercise guides you through tracking the two most fundamental quantities in a cell's life: its ploidy level, represented by the chromosome number $n$, and its DNA content, $C$. By following a single cell lineage from its diploid beginning, through the two stages of meiosis, and finally to the restoration of the diploid state at fertilization, you will build a quantitative framework for understanding how the genome is precisely halved and then restored across generations [@problem_id:2287875].", "problem": "In sexually reproducing organisms, the genetic content of cells changes in a precise, cyclical manner. Consider a single germline stem cell in an animal. We will track its genetic content, specifically its ploidy and DNA content, through the process of meiosis and subsequent fertilization.\n\nLet $n$ represent the number of chromosomes in a single, complete, haploid set of chromosomes for this species. Let $C$ represent the amount of DNA, by mass, in such a haploid set. The state of a cell can therefore be described by a pair (Ploidy, DNA Content).

A human diploid cell has $2n=46$ chromosomes; thus $46$ individual chromosomes, each composed of two sister chromatids, align independently.\n- In meiosis I (metaphase I), homologous chromosomes pair to form tetrads (bivalents); therefore, there are $n=23$ aligned structures, each a homologous pair (tetrad), with two chromosomes (four chromatids) per structure.\n\nTherefore:\n- Cell A is in metaphase of mitosis (because it shows $46$ individually aligned replicated chromosomes).\n- Cell B is in metaphase I of meiosis (because it shows $23$ tetrads/bivalents).\n\nNow determine the outcomes upon completion of the respective full division processes.\n\nFor Cell A (mitosis):\n- Anaphase separates sister chromatids, distributing one chromatid from each chromosome to opposite poles.\n- Telophase and cytokinesis produce two daughter cells, each with the same chromosome number as the parent, i.e., $2n=46$. Immediately after division, each chromosome consists of a single chromatid; after S phase in the next cycle, chromosomes will replicate again.\n- The two daughter cells are genetically identical to each other (barring mutation), because mitosis preserves the genome without recombination or independent assortment.\n\nFor Cell B (meiosis, starting at metaphase I):\n- Anaphase I separates homologous chromosomes; sister chromatids remain together.\n- Telophase I and cytokinesis produce two cells that are haploid in chromosome set (each has $n=23$ chromosomes), but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids.\n- Meiosis II then separates sister chromatids, producing a total of four haploid cells, each with $n=23$ chromosomes, each chromosome now consisting of a single chromatid.\n- Due to independent assortment and crossing over in meiosis I, the final products are genetically distinct from each other.\n\nEvaluate each statement:\n- A: False. Mitosis yields diploid daughters with $2n=46$, not haploid $23$.\n- B: False. Meiosis yields haploid products; not diploid $46$.\n- C: True.

This final practice moves from cytogenetics to classical genetics, exploring how alleles on linked genes are transmitted. By contrasting the outcome of mitosis in a somatic cell with the statistical distribution of gametes from meiosis, you will clearly see the fundamental difference between these processes: mitosis for genetic preservation and meiosis for generating the genetic variation that fuels evolution [@problem_id:2310361].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a diploid model organism, *Caenorhabditis elegans*, and focuses on two linked genes on the same autosome. The first gene, which we will denote with alleles $U$ and $u$, affects locomotion. The second gene, denoted with alleles $D$ and $d$, affects body size. The wild-type alleles ($U$ and $D$) are dominant over the mutant alleles ($u$ and $d$). To begin her experiment, the geneticist creates a heterozygous worm by crossing a pure-breeding wild-type worm ($UD/UD$) with a pure-breeding double-mutant worm ($ud/ud$).

The genotypes of these cells cannot be predicted from the information given.", "solution": "We begin by distinguishing mitosis and meiosis for the F1 heterozygote in coupling phase, genotype $UD/ud$.\n\nMitosis: In a single mitotic event, the cell replicates its DNA to form sister chromatids and then segregates one sister chromatid of each chromosome to each daughter cell. Homologous chromosomes do not pair or undergo obligate crossing over in mitosis. Therefore, barring rare mitotic recombination, both somatic daughter cells retain the same allelic configuration as the parent somatic cell. Thus each somatic daughter cell remains $UD/ud$.\n\nMeiosis: In meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair and may undergo crossing over. Let $r$ denote the recombination fraction between the $U$ and $D$ loci. The map distance is given as 20 map units, which for such a short interval is taken as $r=0.20$. For a heterozygote in coupling phase $UD/ud$, the nonrecombinant gametes are $UD$ and $ud$, and the recombinant gametes are $Ud$ and $uD$.
