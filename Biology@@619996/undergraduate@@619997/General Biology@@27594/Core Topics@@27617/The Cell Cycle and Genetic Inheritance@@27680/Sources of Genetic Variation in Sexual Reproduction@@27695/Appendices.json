{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The sheer scale of genetic variation generated during sexual reproduction can be breathtaking. One of the foundational mechanisms driving this diversity is the independent assortment of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I. This first exercise [@problem_id:2314743] provides a direct way to quantify the immense number of possible chromosome combinations in gametes, using a hypothetical insect as a model. By performing this calculation, you will gain a concrete appreciation for how this single process can create a vast repertoire of genetic possibilities even before considering other sources of variation.", "problem": "In the field of evolutionary biology, the genetic diversity within a population is a cornerstone for its ability to adapt. One of the primary mechanisms generating this diversity in sexually reproducing organisms is the process of meiosis.\n\nConsider a hypothetical species of insect, the Azure-winged Beetle, which has a diploid chromosome number of $2n=28$. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes align at the metaphase plate and then separate, a process known as independent assortment. This means that for each pair of homologous chromosomes, the orientation (i.e., which pole the paternal vs. maternal chromosome will travel to) is random and independent of the orientation of all other pairs.\n\nAssuming two Azure-winged Beetles mate, calculate the total number of possible genetically distinct zygotes that could be produced. For the purpose of this problem, you must consider only the genetic variation that arises from the independent assortment of whole chromosomes and ignore any variation that would be introduced by crossing over.", "solution": "We are told the Azure-winged Beetle has a diploid chromosome number of $2n=28$, so the haploid number is $n=14$. In meiosis I, independent assortment means that for each homologous chromosome pair, there are $2$ equally likely orientations (maternal vs. paternal homologue going to a given pole), and these choices are independent across all pairs.\n\nFor one parent, the number of genetically distinct gametes produced by independent assortment alone (ignoring crossing over) is the product of $2$ choices for each of the $n$ homologous pairs:\n$$\n\\text{gametes per parent} = 2^{n} = 2^{14}.\n$$\nWhen two parents mate, the zygote is formed by fusion of one gamete from each parent. The total number of genetically distinct zygotes (again ignoring crossing over) is the product of the numbers of possible gametes from each parent:\n$$\n\\text{zygotes} = 2^{14} \\times 2^{14} = 2^{28}.\n$$\nEquivalently, per chromosome pair in the zygote there are $2$ maternal choices times $2$ paternal choices, giving $4$ possibilities per pair, and across $n$ pairs this yields $4^{n} = 2^{2n} = 2^{28}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2^{28}}$$", "id": "2314743"}, {"introduction": "While independent assortment shuffles whole chromosomes, crossing over adds another layer of diversity by exchanging segments between homologous chromosomes, thereby reshuffling alleles that are physically linked. This next practice problem [@problem_id:2314773] integrates both of these key mechanisms. It challenges you to calculate gamete frequencies for a set of genes where some are linked on the same chromosome and another is on a different chromosome, assorting independently. Working through this scenario is fundamental to understanding gene mapping and predicting the outcomes of genetic crosses.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying inheritance patterns in a fictional species of deep-sea squid. Three genes are of particular interest: one for filament length (alleles $F$ for long and $f$ for short), one for glow intensity (alleles $G$ for bright and $g$ for dim), and one for head shape (alleles $H$ for smooth and $h$ for ridged). The geneticist obtains an individual that is heterozygous for all three traits. This triply heterozygous squid ($\\text{FfGgHh}$) was produced by a cross between two true-breeding parental lines: one line had long filaments, a dim glow, and a smooth head, while the other line had short filaments, a bright glow, and a ridged head.\n\nThrough extensive analysis, it is known that the genes for filament length (F) and glow intensity (G) are linked, while the gene for head shape (H) is located on a different chromosome and assorts independently. The recombination frequency between the F and G loci is 10%.\n\nCalculate the probability that this triply heterozygous squid will produce a gamete with the genotype $\\text{fgh}$.

This problem [@problem_id:2314768] explores what happens when this architecture is altered, focusing on a chromosomal inversion. By analyzing how a crossover event within a heterozygous inversion affects the viability of gametes, you will discover how certain structural changes can effectively suppress recombination. This phenomenon, known as crossover suppression, has significant evolutionary consequences by \"locking\" specific combinations of alleles together.", "problem": "In a certain species of flowering plant, two genes, Gene G and Gene H, are located on the same chromosome. Gene G controls seed coat texture, with allele $G$ for glossy and $g$ for grainy. Gene H controls stem height, with allele $H$ for tall and $h$ for short.\n\nAn individual plant is discovered that is heterozygous for a large paracentric inversion on this chromosome. A paracentric inversion is one that does not include the centromere. The non-inverted chromosome carries the alleles $g$ and $h$. The inverted chromosome carries the alleles $G$ and $H$.

The non-inverted homolog carries alleles in cis as $\\text{gh}$, and the inverted homolog carries alleles in cis as $\\text{GH}$.\n\nDuring meiotic prophase I in an inversion heterozygote, homologous pairing within the inverted region occurs via formation of an inversion loop. A single crossover event between loci G and H inside this loop in a paracentric inversion (which excludes the centromere) produces four chromatids: two nonrecombinant chromatids (one carrying $\\text{gh}$ and one carrying $\\text{GH}$) and two recombinant chromatids. Because the inversion is paracentric, the two recombinant chromatids are structurally abnormal: one is dicentric (containing two centromeres) and forms a bridge that breaks at anaphase I, and the other is acentric (lacking a centromere) and is lost. Both recombinant chromatids therefore carry deletions/duplications and are not transmitted as viable gametes.\n\nConsequently, only the two nonrecombinant chromatids give rise to viable gametes, and these retain the original parental allelic combinations $\\text{gh}$ and $\\text{GH}$.
