{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The transition from the G2 phase into mitosis must be a decisive, all-or-nothing event. This exercise explores the ingenious molecular switch that ensures this abrupt entry, which involves stockpiling inactive M-phase Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (M-CDK) complexes and then activating them all at once. By considering a scenario where the inhibitory brake on M-CDK is disabled, you can probe the importance of this 'wait-and-fire' mechanism for proper cell cycle timing [@problem_id:2283827].", "problem": "The transition from the G2 phase to the M (mitosis) phase of the cell cycle is a tightly regulated process in eukaryotic cells. The key molecular machine driving this transition is the Mitosis-Promoting Factor (MPF), a protein complex composed of Cyclin B and a Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1). The activity of MPF is controlled by phosphorylation. As Cyclin B accumulates during the G2 phase, it binds to CDK1. This newly formed MPF complex is then immediately phosphorylated on an inhibitory site by the Wee1 kinase, rendering it inactive. This allows the cell to build up a large stockpile of inactive MPF. At the proper time, the phosphatase Cdc25 removes this inhibitory phosphate, leading to a rapid and widespread activation of MPF, which robustly triggers entry into mitosis.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered cell line where the endogenous CDK1 gene has been replaced with a mutant version. This mutant CDK1 protein functions normally in every respect (it can bind Cyclin B and phosphorylate its targets) except for one change: the specific amino acid residue that is normally phosphorylated by Wee1 kinase has been altered, such that Wee1 can no longer phosphorylate or inhibit this mutant CDK1.\n\nAssuming all other cellular components, including Cyclin B, Wee1, and Cdc25, are normal and functional, what is the most likely consequence for this engineered cell line compared to a normal, wild-type cell line?\n\nA. The cell will enter mitosis prematurely.\n\nB. The cell will be delayed in entering mitosis.\n\nC. The cell will arrest in the G2 phase and will not enter mitosis.\n\nD. The timing of entry into mitosis will be unaffected.\n\nE. The cell will enter mitosis normally but will arrest in anaphase.", "solution": "1. In a normal cell, Cyclin B accumulates during G2 and binds CDK1 to form MPF. Immediately after formation, Wee1 phosphorylates CDK1 on its inhibitory site, keeping MPF inactive. This allows the cell to stockpile inactive MPF. At the appropriate time, Cdc25 removes the inhibitory phosphate, triggering a rapid, switch-like activation of MPF and synchronous entry into mitosis.\n\n2. In the engineered cell, the Wee1 phosphorylation site on CDK1 is altered so that Wee1 cannot phosphorylate or inhibit CDK1. All other functions of CDK1, including binding Cyclin B and target phosphorylation, remain intact, and the activating phosphorylation by CAK is still possible because only the Wee1 site is altered.\n\n3. Without the inhibitory phosphorylation by Wee1, newly formed Cyclin B–CDK1 complexes will not be held inactive. Because CAK activity is generally constitutive, the Cyclin B–CDK1 complex will become active as soon as Cyclin B accumulates and binds CDK1, without requiring Cdc25 to remove an inhibitory phosphate.\n\n4. Consequently, the cell cannot build a stockpile of inactive MPF, and MPF activity will rise earlier and more gradually with Cyclin B accumulation. This removes a critical inhibitory checkpoint and advances the timing of mitotic entry relative to wild-type cells.\n\n5. Therefore, the most likely outcome is premature entry into mitosis compared to the normal cell line.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2283827"}, {"introduction": "Once a cell enters mitosis, it faces another critical checkpoint before dividing its genetic material: the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. This checkpoint ensures sister chromatids do not separate until every chromosome is properly attached to the mitotic spindle, preventing catastrophic errors in chromosome segregation. This thought experiment investigates the core of this mechanism, which relies on the targeted destruction of an inhibitory protein named securin to unleash a \"molecular scissor\" that separates the chromosomes [@problem_id:2283829].", "problem": "In the development of novel anti-cancer therapies, a research team synthesizes a compound named \"Separinhib.\" This drug is designed to halt cell proliferation by interfering with a critical stage of mitosis. The mechanism of Separinhib is to bind tightly to the protein securin, specifically at the site recognized by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). This binding event effectively renders securin \"invisible\" to the APC/C machinery, preventing its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome.\n\nFor context, the normal transition from metaphase to anaphase is a tightly regulated process. Sister chromatids, which are identical copies of a replicated chromosome, are held together by a protein complex called cohesin. The separation of these sister chromatids is initiated when a protease called separase cleaves the cohesin complex. However, separase is normally kept in an inactive state by being bound to its inhibitory partner, securin. The APC/C triggers anaphase by targeting securin for destruction, thus liberating and activating separase.\n\nGiven the specific molecular action of Separinhib, at which point in the cell cycle will a population of treated, actively dividing cells most likely arrest?\n\nA. The G1/S checkpoint\n\nB. The G2/M transition\n\nC. Prophase\n\nD. The Metaphase-Anaphase transition\n\nE. Telophase", "solution": "The normal metaphase-to-anaphase transition requires APC/C-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of securin. Degradation of securin releases and activates separase, which then cleaves cohesin, allowing sister chromatid separation and anaphase onset.\n\nSeparinhib binds securin at the APC/C recognition site, preventing APC/C from ubiquitinating securin. As a consequence, securin is not degraded and continues to inhibit separase. With separase kept inactive, cohesin is not cleaved, sister chromatids remain linked, and anaphase cannot begin.\n\nTherefore, cells will align chromosomes on the metaphase plate but will fail to initiate chromatid separation, causing arrest at the metaphase-anaphase transition.\n\nEliminating the other options: G1/S and G2/M are regulated by cyclin-CDK and checkpoints upstream of mitosis; prophase occurs before APC/C action on securin; telophase occurs after anaphase. The described blockade specifically prevents anaphase onset, matching the metaphase-anaphase transition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2283829"}, {"introduction": "Maintaining a stable genome requires that DNA is replicated exactly once per cell cycle, a principle known as the \"once-and-only-once\" rule. To enforce this, cells use a sophisticated two-step system: they \"license\" origins for replication in the G1 phase and then \"fire\" them in S phase, while simultaneously preventing re-licensing. This problem delves into the elegant mechanism that prevents re-replication by examining the role of geminin, a key inhibitor of the licensing machinery, and reveals the dire consequences of its absence [@problem_id:2283866].", "problem": "The eukaryotic cell cycle is a sequence of tightly regulated events culminating in cell division. A critical control point is the initiation of DNA synthesis, which must occur only once per cycle to maintain genomic integrity. This \"once-and-only-once\" rule is enforced by a two-step mechanism involving replication licensing and firing.\n\nIn late M phase and G1 phase, origins of replication are \"licensed\" by the assembly of a pre-Replication Complex (pre-RC). The pre-RC includes the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1. The loading of Cdt1 is a key step that licenses an origin for a single round of replication.\n\nAt the G1/S transition, S-phase Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (S-CDKs) \"fire\" the licensed origins, initiating DNA synthesis. Concurrently, S-CDKs phosphorylate pre-RC components to prevent new licensing events. A crucial part of this prevention mechanism is a protein named geminin. Geminin protein begins to accumulate in S phase, persists through G2 and M phases, and its primary function is to bind to and sequester Cdt1, thereby blocking its ability to license origins. Geminin is degraded at the end of mitosis, allowing Cdt1 to become active again for the next G1 phase.\n\nConsider a specialized line of mammalian cells being studied in a research laboratory. These cells possess a homozygous null mutation in the gene encoding geminin, which results in the complete absence of any functional geminin protein. The cells are cultured in ideal conditions that promote continuous proliferation.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected primary outcome for this cell line over several cell generations?\n\nA. The cells will arrest in G1 phase because origins of replication cannot be properly licensed in the absence of geminin's regulatory input, preventing entry into S phase.\n\nB. The cells will replicate their DNA once per cycle but will fail to enter mitosis, leading to an accumulation of cells arrested in G2 phase with a 4C DNA content.\n\nC. The cells will be unable to prevent the re-loading of replication machinery onto already replicated DNA, leading to multiple rounds of DNA synthesis within a single cycle, resulting in polyploidy and catastrophic genomic instability.\n\nD. The cells will divide more rapidly than their wild-type counterparts because the G1/S checkpoint is bypassed, leading to uncontrolled proliferation but maintaining a stable diploid genome.\n\nE. The cells will proceed through the cell cycle normally, but the fidelity of DNA replication will be compromised, leading to an increase in single-nucleotide point mutations but no change in chromosome number.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the fate of a cell line with a homozygous null mutation for geminin. To solve this, we must analyze the function of geminin and the consequences of its absence.\n\n1.  **Normal Function of Geminin:** In a normal cell cycle, geminin's role is to prevent re-replication of DNA. It achieves this by binding to and inhibiting Cdt1, a critical DNA replication licensing factor. Geminin is present during S, G2, and M phases. This ensures that once an origin of replication has \"fired\" at the beginning of S phase, it cannot be \"re-licensed\" by Cdt1 to fire again within the same cell cycle. Geminin is degraded at the metaphase-anaphase transition, which allows Cdt1 to become active again in the subsequent G1 phase to license origins for the next cycle.\n\n2.  **Consequence of Geminin Absence:** The mutation described is a homozygous null mutation, meaning no functional geminin protein is produced. Therefore, Cdt1 is not inhibited during S, G2, and M phases.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Mutant Cell Cycle:**\n    *   **G1 Phase:** Cells in G1 phase will proceed normally. Cdt1 is active, and it will correctly license the origins of replication by helping to load the MCM helicase complex, forming the pre-RC.\n    *   **G1/S Transition:** S-CDKs become active and trigger the firing of these licensed origins, initiating DNA synthesis. The cell enters S phase.\n    *   **S Phase and G2 Phase:** In a normal cell, as replication forks move away from an origin, that origin is now available. However, the presence of geminin would prevent Cdt1 from re-loading onto this origin. In the mutant cell, there is no geminin. Cdt1 remains active throughout S phase. Consequently, as soon as an origin has been replicated, the active Cdt1 can immediately re-license it. The S-CDKs, which also remain active, can then cause this newly re-licensed origin to fire again.\n    *   **Outcome of Re-licensing and Re-firing:** This leads to a runaway process called \"re-replication,\" where sections of the genome, or the entire genome, are synthesized multiple times within a single, prolonged S phase. A normal cell that completes S phase has a 4C DNA content (where C is the haploid DNA content). A cell lacking geminin will end up with a DNA content greater than 4C, often 8C, 16C, or even higher. This state of having more than two paired sets of chromosomes is known as polyploidy.\n\n4.  **Long-Term Fate:**\n    *   The massive amount of extra DNA and the likely tangled state of the re-replicated chromosomes will make proper chromosome segregation in mitosis impossible. When these cells attempt to enter mitosis, they will undergo \"mitotic catastrophe.\" The mitotic spindle will be unable to manage the abnormal chromosome content, leading to extensive DNA breakage, chromosome mis-segregation, and aneuploidy (an incorrect number of chromosomes) in any daughter cells that manage to form.\n    *   This extreme level of genomic instability is not sustainable. The vast majority of these cells will either arrest due to DNA damage checkpoints or undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). The cell line will not be viable in the long term.\n\n5.  **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A. The cells will arrest in G1 phase...** This is incorrect. Cdt1 is the licensing factor. The absence of its inhibitor (geminin) would lead to excessive, not blocked, licensing activity. Cells will have no problem entering S phase.\n    *   **B. The cells will ... arrest in G2 phase with a 4C DNA content.** This is incorrect. While the DNA damage caused by re-replication might trigger a G2 arrest, the fundamental problem is that the cells will have a DNA content greater than 4C. A stable 4C arrest is not the primary outcome.\n    *   **C. The cells will be unable to prevent the re-loading of replication machinery..., leading to multiple rounds of DNA synthesis within a single cycle, resulting in polyploidy and catastrophic genomic instability.** This option accurately describes the entire sequence of events: failure to inhibit Cdt1 leads to re-replication, which causes polyploidy, and the attempt to segregate this polyploid genome leads to mitotic catastrophe and genomic instability. This is the correct prediction.\n    *   **D. The cells will divide more rapidly...** This is incorrect. The process of re-replication and the subsequent G2/M checkpoint activation and mitotic problems will significantly slow down or halt the cell cycle, not accelerate it. The genome will also become highly unstable, not stable.\n    *   **E. The cells will ... lead to an increase in single-nucleotide point mutations but no change in chromosome number.** This is incorrect. While genomic instability can secondarily increase point mutations, the primary and defining defect is a failure in the regulation of replication quantity, leading to large-scale changes in chromosome number (ploidy and aneuploidy), not just small-scale mutations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2283866"}]}
