By observing chromosome number, structure, and alignment, you can act as a cellular detective, deducing the precise moment in the intricate dance of meiosis. This practice challenges you to apply these observational skills to a hypothetical cell, reinforcing your ability to distinguish between mitosis, meiosis I, and meiosis IIâ€”a cornerstone for understanding genetics. [@problem_id:2298151]", "problem": "Exobiologists studying the reproductive cycle of a newly discovered multicellular organism, *Xenothrix martiana*, have determined from its somatic cell karyotype that it is a diploid organism with a chromosome number of $2n=40$. During an investigation of its gametogenesis, a single dividing cell is isolated and prepared for microscopic analysis. The observation reveals that there are 20 distinct chromosome structures aligned along the cell's equatorial plane, also known as the metaphase plate. Each of these 20 structures is composed of two sister chromatids joined at a centromere.\n\nBased on this cytological evidence, identify the specific stage of cell division being observed.\n\nA.

Anaphase II of Meiosis", "solution": "The organism is diploid with $2n=40$, so the haploid number is $n=20$.\n\nAt metaphase of mitosis, all replicated chromosomes align individually at the metaphase plate; the number of chromosomes observed would be $2n=40$, each consisting of two sister chromatids joined at one centromere. Since only 20 such structures are observed, this excludes mitotic metaphase.\n\nIn meiosis I, at metaphase I, homologous chromosomes pair as bivalents (tetrads). The number of aligned units is $n=20$, but each unit is a bivalent composed of two homologous chromosomes, hence four chromatids and two centromeres per bivalent. The observation states that each of the 20 structures consists of two sister chromatids joined at a single centromere, which are monovalent chromosomes, not bivalents. Therefore, this is not metaphase I.\n\nAnaphase I and anaphase II involve segregation toward poles rather than alignment at the equatorial plane, so stages B and F are inconsistent with the observation. Prophase II precedes alignment at the metaphase plate, so stage D is also inconsistent.\n\nIn meiosis II, each cell is haploid with $n=20$ chromosomes. At metaphase II, these $n=20$ chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, each chromosome consisting of two sister chromatids joined at one centromere. This exactly matches the observation of 20 structures, each with two sister chromatids at a single centromere, aligned at the equatorial plane.\n\nTherefore, the stage is metaphase II of meiosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2298151"}, {"introduction": "While normal meiosis ensures the faithful transmission of genetic material, errors in this process can lead to aneuploidy, a condition with significant medical implications. This problem moves from textbook processes to a practical application, using the real-world example of Trisomy 21 to explore the consequences of meiotic nondisjunction. By modeling how chromosomes segregate from a trivalent structure, you can quantitatively predict the proportions of normal and abnormal gametes an individual might produce. [@problem_id:2298150]", "problem": "An individual has Trisomy 21, a genetic condition characterized by the presence of three homologous copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two. Assume that during spermatogenesis in this individual, the most common meiotic event for chromosome 21 is the formation of a trivalent structure during prophase I. This trivalent segregates during anaphase I such that two of the homologous chromosomes move to one secondary spermatocyte, and the remaining one moves to the other. Further assume that meiosis II proceeds without any chromosomal errors in all secondary spermatocytes.\n\nBased on this specific segregation model, what are the theoretical proportions of euploid (containing one copy of chromosome 21) and aneuploid (containing an abnormal number of chromosome 21) gametes that this individual would produce?\n\nA. 100% aneuploid gametes.\n\nB. 66.7% aneuploid gametes and 33.3% euploid gametes.\n\nC. 50% aneuploid gametes and 50% euploid gametes.\n\nD. 25% (n+1) aneuploid gametes, 25% (n-1) aneuploid gametes, and 50% euploid gametes.\n\nE. 25% aneuploid gametes and 75% euploid gametes.", "solution": "The individual is trisomic for chromosome 21, so a primary spermatocyte contains three homologous copies of chromosome 21. By assumption, during prophase I a trivalent forms, and at anaphase I a 2:1 segregation occurs: two homologs go to one secondary spermatocyte (call this cell A) and one homolog goes to the other secondary spermatocyte (cell B).\n\nMeiosis II proceeds without error in both secondary spermatocytes. For chromosome 21:\n\n- In cell A (which received two homologs), each homolog consists of sister chromatids prior to meiosis II. At anaphase II, sister chromatids separate equationally. Each of the two resulting gametes from cell A receives one chromatid from each of the two homologs. Therefore, each gamete from cell A contains two copies of chromosome 21, i.e., is an aneuploid gamete of type $n+1$.\n\n- In cell B (which received one homolog), at anaphase II the sister chromatids of that single homolog separate equationally. Each of the two resulting gametes from cell B receives one chromatid of chromosome 21. Therefore, each gamete from cell B contains one copy of chromosome 21, i.e., is a euploid gamete.\n\nSince each meiosis yields two gametes from cell A (both aneuploid $n+1$) and two gametes from cell B (both euploid), the proportions are\n$$\nP(\\text{aneuploid})=\\frac{2}{4}=\\frac{1}{2},\\qquad P(\\text{euploid})=\\frac{2}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nNo $n-1$ gametes arise under the stated segregation model and the assumption of error-free meiosis II.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2298150"}, {"introduction": "The genome is not a static entity; over evolutionary time, the structure of chromosomes can change dramatically. This final practice explores one such mechanism: a pericentric inversion, which can alter a chromosome's very morphology. By analyzing how breakpoints and the inversion of a centromere-containing segment can change an acrocentric chromosome into a metacentric one, you gain insight into the dynamic processes that shape karyotypes and drive species evolution. [@problem_id:2298140]", "problem": "In cytogenetics, a karyotype is used to classify chromosomes based on size, centromere position, and banding pattern. The position of the centromere divides a chromosome into a short arm (p-arm) and a long arm (q-arm). Based on the ratio of the arm lengths, chromosomes are classified as metacentric (centromere in the middle, p and q arms are roughly equal), submetacentric (centromere off-center), or acrocentric (centromere very near one end, resulting in a very short p-arm and a very long q-arm).\n\nConsider a specific acrocentric chromosome in a diploid organism. This chromosome undergoes a single chromosomal mutation known as a pericentric inversion. A pericentric inversion involves two breaks on opposite sides of the centromere, followed by a 180-degree rotation of the segment containing the centromere before it is re-ligated. After this event, a karyotype analysis reveals that the formerly acrocentric chromosome now appears to be metacentric.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct and most precise explanation for this observed change in chromosome morphology?\n\nA. The inversion was asymmetrical, with the breakpoint on the q-arm being significantly farther from the centromere than the breakpoint on the p-arm.\n\nB. The inversion was symmetrical, with the breakpoints on the p-arm and q-arm being equidistant from the centromere.\n\nC. The event must have been a paracentric inversion, not a pericentric one, as only this type of inversion can alter the arm ratio.\n\nD. The inversion was asymmetrical, with the breakpoint on the p-arm being significantly farther from the centromere than the breakpoint on the q-arm.\n\nE. This change is impossible through a single pericentric inversion; it would require a more complex translocation event.", "solution": "Let the original acrocentric chromosome have arm lengths $p$ (short) and $q$ (long), with $q \\gg p$. Consider a pericentric inversion with breakpoints at distances $a$ on the p-arm and $b$ on the q-arm from the centromere, where $0<a<p$ and $0<b<q$. The inverted segment includes the centromere and spans from $-a$ (p side) to $+b$ (q side).\n\nPartition the chromosome into four segments relative to the centromere:\n- Proximal p segment of length $a$ and distal p tip of length $p-a$.\n- Proximal q segment of length $b$ and distal q tip of length $q-b$.\n\nAfter inversion of the centromere-containing segment, the arm on one side of the centromere comprises the inverted proximal q segment followed by the distal p tip, and the arm on the other side comprises the inverted proximal p segment followed by the distal q tip. Thus the two post-inversion arm lengths are\n$$\nL_{1}=b+(p-a), \\quad L_{2}=a+(q-b).\n$$\nThese satisfy $L_{1}+L_{2}=p+q$, as required.\n\nFor the chromosome to become metacentric (arms equal in length), impose $L_{1}=L_{2}$:\n$$\nb+p-a=a+q-b \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; 2b-2a=q-p \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; b-a=\\frac{q-p}{2}.\n$$\nSince $q>p$ for an acrocentric chromosome, this requires $b>a$, i.e., the breakpoint on the q-arm must be farther from the centromere than the breakpoint on the p-arm. In the special case $a=b$ (symmetrical inversion), one finds $L_{1}=p$ and $L_{2}=q$, leaving the arm ratio unchanged and the chromosome acrocentric. A paracentric inversion, by definition, does not include the centromere and therefore does not alter the arm ratio. A single appropriately placed pericentric inversion is sufficient to convert an acrocentric morphology to a metacentric one.\n\nTherefore, the correct and most precise explanation is that the pericentric inversion was asymmetrical with the breakpoint on the q-arm significantly farther from the centromere than the breakpoint on the p-arm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2298140"}]}
