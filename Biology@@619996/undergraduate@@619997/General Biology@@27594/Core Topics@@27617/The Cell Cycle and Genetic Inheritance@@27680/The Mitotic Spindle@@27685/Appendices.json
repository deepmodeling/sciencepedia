We can model this system by considering the velocities they impart on the spindle poles.\n\n- A motor protein, Kinesin-5, works to push the spindle poles apart, contributing a separation velocity of $v_5$.\n- Another protein, Dynein, is anchored at the cell periphery and pulls on astral microtubules, also contributing to pole separation with a velocity of $v_d$.\n- A third motor, Kinesin-14, crosslinks microtubules and pulls the poles together, contributing a collapsing velocity of $v_{14}$.\n\nIn a normal, healthy cell (wild-type), the spindle assembles and reaches a stable, constant length $L_{WT}$ during metaphase. At this point, the total outward velocity is perfectly balanced by the inward velocity, such that $v_5 + v_d = v_{14}$. The cell itself has a finite diameter, $L_{cell}$, which imposes a physical upper limit on the spindle length. In a wild-type cell, it is observed that $L_{WT} < L_{cell}$.\n\nNow, consider a mutant cell line where the gene for Kinesin-14 is deleted, rendering it completely non-functional. Assume that the activities of Kinesin-5 and Dynein are unaffected by this mutation, and that $v_5$ and $v_d$ are constant positive values throughout spindle formation.\n\nStarting from a negligible initial pole-to-pole distance, which of the following outcomes best describes the fate of the spindle length in this mutant cell?\n\nA.

This practice delves into the crucial error-correction mechanism that validates chromosome attachments. By examining what happens when this surveillance system is disabled, you will appreciate how cells distinguish correct, tension-generating attachments from incorrect ones to guarantee high-fidelity segregation [@problem_id:2321384].", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a culture of actively dividing animal cells is treated with a novel proprietary drug called \"Correctin-inhibitor.\" This drug is known to have a single, highly specific molecular effect: it selectively inhibits the kinase activity of Aurora B kinase, but only at the kinetochore. The normal function of Aurora B kinase at this location is to sense the lack of mechanical tension from incorrect microtubule-kinetochore attachments and to destabilize these incorrect attachments, allowing for a new attempt at correct attachment. The drug does not affect any other cellular processes, including microtubule polymerization, spindle pole formation, or the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C).\n\nGiven this information, which of the following outcomes is the most likely observation for cells treated with Correctin-inhibitor as they attempt to proceed through mitosis?\n\nA. The mitotic spindle will completely depolymerize, causing the cell to revert to an interphase-like state.\n\nB.

The chromosomes will attach to spindle microtubules, but many will remain persistently misaligned, failing to organize correctly at the metaphase plate.\n\nE. The cell will proceed through metaphase and enter anaphase prematurely, before all chromosomes have attached to the spindle.", "solution": "To determine the consequence of inhibiting the error-correcting function of Aurora B kinase at the kinetochore, we must first understand the normal process of chromosome alignment during mitosis.\n\n**Step 1: The Goal of Prometaphase and Metaphase**\nDuring prometaphase, microtubules emanating from the two spindle poles \"search and capture\" the kinetochores of chromosomes. The goal is to establish a state of bi-orientation, where the two sister kinetochores of a single chromosome are attached to microtubules from opposite spindle poles. This is called an amphitelic attachment. The opposing pulling forces generate tension across the centromere, which is a key signal for a correct attachment. Once all chromosomes have achieved this state, they become aligned at the spindle equator, a configuration known as the metaphase plate. This alignment is crucial for ensuring that sister chromatids are segregated equally to daughter cells during anaphase.\n\n**Step 2: The Role of Error Correction and Aurora B Kinase**\nThe attachment process is stochastic, and incorrect attachments frequently occur. Common errors include:\n- **Syntelic attachment:** Both sister kinetochores attach to microtubules from the same spindle pole.\n- **Merotelic attachment:** One kinetochore attaches to microtubules from both poles.\n\nThese incorrect attachments do not generate the proper tension that is characteristic of a correct amphitelic attachment. The cell has an error-correction mechanism to deal with this, which is orchestrated by Aurora B kinase. Aurora B is localized to the inner centromere. In the absence of tension (i.e., during an incorrect attachment), the outer kinetochore is brought into close proximity to Aurora B. Aurora B then phosphorylates proteins in the kinetochore, such as the Ndc80 complex, which reduces their affinity for microtubules. This destabilizes the incorrect attachment, releasing the microtubule(s) and giving the cell another opportunity to form a correct, stable, high-tension attachment.\n\n**Step 3: The Effect of the Drug \"Correctin-inhibitor\"**\nThe problem states that Correctin-inhibitor specifically inhibits the kinase activity of Aurora B at the kinetochore. This means the error-correction mechanism is disabled. When an incorrect attachment (e.g., syntelic or merotelic) forms, there is no tension, but the inhibited Aurora B kinase can no longer phosphorylate its targets to destabilize the attachment. Consequently, the incorrect, low-tension attachment is \"locked in\" and becomes inappropriately stabilized.\n\n**Step 4: Predicting the Cellular Outcome**\nWith the error-correction mechanism shut down, chromosomes that happen to form incorrect attachments will remain incorrectly attached. A chromosome with a syntelic attachment will be pulled toward only one pole. A chromosome with a merotelic attachment might be pulled toward one pole while also being tethered to the other, causing it to lag behind. Neither of these scenarios allows the chromosome to align at the metaphase plate. Therefore, the cell will end up in a state where some chromosomes (those that luckily formed correct attachments) may be at the metaphase plate, but many others will be persistantly misaligned, scattered between the poles and the plate. The cell is unable to achieve proper chromosome congression.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluating the Options**\n- **A. The mitotic spindle will completely depolymerize...** This is incorrect. The drug's action is specific to microtubule-kinetochore stability, not the stability of the microtubules that form the spindle itself.\n- **B. Kinetochores will be unable to form any attachments...** This is the opposite of the drug's effect. The drug *prevents the detachment* of incorrect attachments, leading to their stabilization, not a failure to attach in the first place.\n- **C. All chromosomes will successfully congress and align perfectly...** This is incorrect. The entire point of the error-correction mechanism is to ensure successful congression. Inhibiting it will lead to congression failure.\n- **D. The chromosomes will attach to spindle microtubules, but many will remain persistently misaligned, failing to organize correctly at the metaphase plate.** This prediction perfectly matches our analysis. Attachments form, but incorrect ones are not corrected, leading to widespread and persistent misalignment.\n- **E. The cell will proceed through metaphase and enter anaphase prematurely...** This is incorrect. The presence of unattached or improperly attached (low-tension) kinetochores activates the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC), which inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). This causes a *delay or arrest* in metaphase, preventing a premature entry into anaphase.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is the failure of chromosomes to align properly at the metaphase plate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2321384"}, {"introduction": "Once all chromosomes are correctly aligned, the cell executes anaphase with remarkable precision. This final practice moves from qualitative concepts to a quantitative biophysical model of chromosome movement.

They model the cytoplasm as a simple viscous fluid and focus on the forces acting during anaphase A.\n\nIn their model for anaphase A (chromosome-to-pole movement), the pulling force, $F_p$, exerted on a single chromosome's kinetochore by a depolymerizing microtubule is not constant but depends on the velocity, $v$, of the chromosome. This force-velocity relationship is approximated as a linear function:\n$$F_p(v) = F_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{v}{v_{\\text{max}}}\\right)$$\nHere, $F_0$ is the stall force (the maximum force generated at zero velocity), and $v_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum unloaded velocity of the process (the velocity at which the generative force drops to zero).\n\nAs the chromosome moves through the cytoplasm, it experiences a viscous drag force, $F_d$, which opposes its motion. This drag is described by the relation:\n$$F_d(v) = \\gamma v$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the drag coefficient. The drag coefficient is known to be directly proportional to the effective viscosity of the cytoplasm, $\\eta$.\n\nIn a normal, wild-type cell with cytoplasmic viscosity $\\eta_0$, the following parameters have been determined:\n- Stall Force, $F_0 = 8.0 \\text{ pN}$\n- Maximum Unloaded Velocity, $v_{\\text{max}} = 50.0 \\text{ nm/s}$\n- Drag Coefficient, $\\gamma_0 = 0.24 \\text{ pN}\\cdot\\text{s/nm}$\n\nThe researchers then treat the cells with a novel drug that specifically targets the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, causing it to become more cross-linked.
