The broth was accidentally left at room temperature, creating ideal conditions for bacterial proliferation. At the start of the observation period, a single contaminating bacterium is detected.

The protein FtsZ is the central architect of cytokinesis, forming a contractile ring that physically divides one cell into two. This exercise [@problem_id:2281329] presents a classic thought experiment involving a temperature-sensitive FtsZ mutant, challenging you to deduce the cellular phenotype when growth and DNA replication become uncoupled from cell division itself.", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating a novel, temperature-sensitive mutant strain of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. This strain possesses a mutation in the *ftsZ* gene. The protein product of this gene, FtsZ, is essential for cell division. At a permissive temperature of 30°C, the FtsZ protein is functional, and the bacteria divide normally via binary fission. However, at a restrictive temperature of 42°C, the FtsZ protein is rendered completely non-functional.\n\nThe microbiologist first grows a culture of these mutant bacteria in a nutrient-rich broth at the permissive temperature of 30°C. Once the culture reaches a healthy, exponential phase of growth, it is abruptly shifted to the restrictive temperature of 42°C. The experimental setup ensures that the bacteria have ample nutrients to continue growth and that the cells are able to successfully complete multiple rounds of DNA replication.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected primary observation of the bacterial cells after they have been incubated for several hours at the restrictive temperature of 42°C?\n\nA. The bacteria will form long, filamentous cells, each containing multiple, fully replicated chromosomes distributed along its length.\n\nB. The bacteria will be unable to replicate their DNA due to the temperature stress, leading to cell cycle arrest and a population of normal-sized, non-dividing cells.\n\nC. The bacteria will divide asymmetrically, with the septum forming near one of the cell poles, resulting in the production of one normal-sized cell and one small, anucleated minicell.\n\nD. The bacteria will immediately lyse because the non-functional FtsZ protein destabilizes the integrity of the cell wall, making the cells susceptible to osmotic pressure.\n\nE. The bacteria will differentiate into endospores, a dormant and resistant state, to survive the unfavorable high-temperature condition.", "solution": "The problem asks for the cellular fate of a specific *E. coli* mutant at a restrictive temperature. Let's break down the biological processes involved.\n\nFirst, we must understand the normal process of binary fission in bacteria like *E. coli*. This process involves three main coordinated events: (1) cell growth and elongation, (2) replication of the circular chromosome and segregation of the copies to opposite ends of the cell, and (3) cytokinesis, which is the physical division of the cell into two.\n\nSecond, we need to identify the specific role of the FtsZ protein. FtsZ is a crucial protein in bacterial cytokinesis. It polymerizes at the future division site in the middle of the cell to form a structure called the Z-ring. This Z-ring acts as a scaffold, recruiting other proteins to form a complex known as the divisome. The divisome then synthesizes a new cell wall and membrane, called the septum, which grows inward and eventually pinches the cell into two identical daughter cells.\n\nThird, we must analyze the effect of the mutation described in the problem. The *ftsZ* gene is mutated such that its protein product is non-functional at 42°C. This means that at the restrictive temperature, the FtsZ protein cannot form the Z-ring. Without the Z-ring, the entire process of cytokinesis is blocked; the cell cannot form a septum and cannot divide.\n\nFourth, we consider the other cellular processes. The problem explicitly states that the bacteria continue to grow (increase in mass and size) and successfully replicate their DNA. This indicates that cell elongation and chromosome replication are uncoupled from cell division.\n\nSynthesizing these points, a cell that cannot divide but continues to grow will simply get longer and longer, forming a filament. Concurrently, as it continues to replicate its DNA without dividing, this single, elongated cell will accumulate multiple copies of its chromosome. These replicated chromosomes, or nucleoids, will be distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the filamentous cell.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. The bacteria will form long, filamentous cells, each containing multiple, fully replicated chromosomes distributed along its length. This description perfectly matches our analysis. The failure of cytokinesis (due to non-functional FtsZ) combined with continued growth and DNA replication leads to the formation of long, multinucleated filaments.\n\nB. The bacteria will be unable to replicate their DNA... This option is incorrect because the problem explicitly states that the cells \"are able to successfully complete multiple rounds of DNA replication.\"\n\nC. The bacteria will divide asymmetrically... This phenotype, characterized by the formation of small, anucleated \"minicells,\" is typically caused by mutations in the *min* gene system (*minC*, *minD*, *minE*), which regulates the *placement* of the Z-ring, not its formation. Since FtsZ is required to form the Z-ring in the first place, no septum (symmetric or asymmetric) can be formed at all.\n\nD. The bacteria will immediately lyse... While very long filaments can eventually become fragile and lyse, this is not the immediate or primary phenotype. The defining characteristic is the change in morphology to a filament due to continued growth in the absence of division. The word \"immediately\" makes this option incorrect.\n\nE. The bacteria will differentiate into endospores... This is factually incorrect. *Escherichia coli* is a species of bacterium that does not have the genetic capacity to form endospores. This survival mechanism is characteristic of other genera, such as *Bacillus* and *Clostridium*.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the outcome is the formation of long, multinucleated filaments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2281329"}, {"introduction": "In some bacteria, the cell cycle is a masterclass in efficiency, with division occurring faster than the time required to copy the entire genome. This requires an elegant solution where new rounds of DNA replication begin before the previous ones have finished. This final practice [@problem_id:2281368] explores this phenomenon of overlapping, or dichotomous, replication, challenging you to determine the state of the chromosome in a rapidly dividing cell where the generation time, $T$, is less than the chromosome replication period, $C$.", "problem": "A species of rapidly growing bacteria is studied under ideal conditions. It exhibits a constant generation time ($T$), defined as the time required for the population to double, which for a single cell corresponds to its division time. The time required to fully replicate its single circular chromosome, from the origin of replication to the terminus, is denoted by $C$. In this particular bacterium, a new round of DNA replication can be initiated before a previous round has completed, a phenomenon known as dichotomous replication.\n\nAssume that a cell initiates septum formation at the exact moment that a round of chromosome replication terminates. For a culture where the chromosome replication period is $C = 40.0$ minutes and the generation time is $T = 25.0$ minutes, determine the total number of replication origins present in a single cell at the precise moment it begins septum formation.", "solution": "In the Cooper–Helmstetter framework for bacteria with overlapping (dichotomous) replication, initiations occur periodically every $T$ minutes. The origin region is duplicated instantaneously at initiation, so each initiation doubles the number of origin copies present in a cell.\n\nThe moment of interest is the initiation of septum formation, which the problem states occurs exactly when a replication round terminates. This implies the time from initiation to this moment is $C$, and we can set the post-termination delay $D$ to zero for this event. Therefore, the initiations that have occurred in the interval of length $C$ immediately preceding this moment are at times $-C, -C + T, -C + 2T, \\dots$, up to but not exceeding $0$. The number of such initiation epochs is\n$$\nn = \\left\\lceil \\frac{C}{T} \\right\\rceil.\n$$\nEach of these $n$ initiations doubles the number of origins in the cell lineage; divisions that may occur between initiations do not change the per-cell count immediately before the next initiation because a daughter inherits half of the origins and then they are doubled at the next initiation. Hence, for a single-chromosome bacterium, the total number of replication origins present at the instant septum formation begins is\n$$\nN_{\\text{ori}} = 2^{n} = 2^{\\lceil C/T \\rceil}.\n$$\nFor $C = 40.0$ minutes and $T = 25.0$ minutes,\n$$\n\\left\\lceil \\frac{C}{T} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{40.0}{25.0} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{8}{5} \\right\\rceil = 2,\n$$\nso\n$$\nN_{\\text{ori}} = 2^{2} = 4.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2281368"}]}
