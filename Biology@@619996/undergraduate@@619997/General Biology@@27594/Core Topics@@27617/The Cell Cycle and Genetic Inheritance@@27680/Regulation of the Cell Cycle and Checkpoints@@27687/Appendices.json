This exercise is based on a classic experiment that first revealed the existence of a dominant, diffusible factor in the cytoplasm that can force a cell into mitosis. Understanding this concept of a 'M-phase Promoting Factor' or MPF is the first step to appreciating how it is regulated. [@problem_id:2312641]", "problem": "In a cell biology laboratory, a classic experiment is performed to investigate the regulation of the cell cycle. A researcher isolates cytoplasm from a donor vertebrate cell that is actively undergoing mitosis, specifically in metaphase. This cytoplasm is then carefully injected into a recipient cell from the same cell line, which has been synchronized and is confirmed to be in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Assuming the volume of cytoplasm injected is sufficient to induce a cellular response, which of the following choices most accurately describes the immediate and primary consequences observed in the nucleus of the recipient cell?\n\nA. The nuclear envelope will break down, and the chromatin will begin to condense into distinct chromosomes.\n\nB. The cell will immediately enter S phase, and DNA replication will be re-initiated.\n\nC. The sister chromatids will separate and begin migrating towards opposite poles of the cell.\n\nD. The cell will become permanently arrested in the G2 phase, unable to proceed with division.\n\nE. The chromatin will decondense, and a new nuclear envelope will form around it.", "solution": "We are asked about the immediate and primary consequences in the nucleus of a G2-phase recipient cell after injection of cytoplasm from a metaphase cell. The key principle from classic cell fusion and cytoplasmic transfer experiments (e.g., Masui and Markert, Xenopus egg assays; Rao and Johnson) is that mitotic cytoplasm contains a diffusible activity that can drive a G2 cell into mitosis. This activity is the M-phase promoting factor, MPF, which is the active Cyclin B-Cdk1 complex.\n\nLogical steps:\n1. A G2-phase cell has not yet activated Cdk1 with Cyclin B to high MPF activity. Its nuclear envelope is intact, and chromatin is decondensed.\n2. Metaphase cytoplasm contains high MPF activity. Injecting sufficient metaphase cytoplasm into a G2 cell effectively raises the MPF activity in the recipient cell to mitotic levels.\n3. Active MPF phosphorylates numerous substrates that execute mitotic entry. Two primary nuclear targets are:\n   - Nuclear lamins: MPF-dependent phosphorylation of lamins disrupts the nuclear lamina, causing nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD).\n   - Chromatin-associated proteins: MPF activates condensins and leads to phosphorylation of histones (for example, histone H3), promoting chromatin condensation into distinct mitotic chromosomes.\n4. Therefore, the immediate and primary nuclear consequences are nuclear envelope breakdown and chromatin condensation, which correspond to early mitotic events (prophase/prometaphase).\n\nExcluding the other options:\n- Option B is incorrect because MPF drives mitotic entry, not S phase. DNA replication is driven by G1/S cyclins and S-phase Cdks and is actively inhibited by high MPF.\n- Option C is incorrect because sister chromatid separation requires activation of the anaphase-promoting complex, APC/C, to ubiquitinate securin and Cyclin B, activating separase. Metaphase cytoplasm is characterized by high MPF and an active spindle checkpoint that restrains APC/C; thus, anaphase onset is not the immediate consequence of MPF addition to a G2 cell.\n- Option D is incorrect because MPF does not arrest cells in G2; it triggers the G2 to M transition.\n- Option E is incorrect because chromatin decondensation and nuclear envelope reassembly occur during mitotic exit, when MPF activity falls due to Cyclin B degradation; injected metaphase cytoplasm raises, rather than lowers, MPF activity.\n\nHence, the correct immediate nuclear response is nuclear envelope breakdown and chromatin condensation into chromosomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2312641"}, {"introduction": "The transition from G1 to S phase is a major decision point for a cell, governed by multiple inputs. This thought experiment challenges you to untangle two of the most important pathways that converge at this checkpoint: the growth-promoting pathway involving the Retinoblastoma protein ($Rb$) and the DNA damage pathway involving the p53 tumor suppressor. By analyzing a cell with a defect in one pathway, you can appreciate the robust, layered nature of cell cycle control. [@problem_id:2312600]", "problem": "In a cancer research laboratory, a line of epithelial cells is being studied. These cells have a specific genetic mutation that renders their Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein completely non-functional. Under normal growth conditions, the absence of functional Rb protein leads to the constitutive activity of the E2F family of transcription factors, which would typically drive the cell cycle forward. However, when these Rb-deficient cells are exposed to a dose of ionizing radiation known to cause significant DNA double-strand breaks, a surprising observation is made: the majority of the cells halt their progression through the cell cycle and arrest in the G1 phase. This indicates that a critical DNA damage checkpoint pathway remains intact and functional, overriding the pro-proliferative signal from the loss of Rb.\n\nWhich of the following molecular components is the most critical upstream activator of the pathway responsible for this observed G1 arrest in response to DNA damage?\n\nA. Maturation-Promoting Factor (MPF)\n\nB. Cyclin D\n\nC. The Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C)\n\nD. p53 tumor suppressor protein\n\nE. E2F transcription factor", "solution": "The premise is that Rb is non-functional, so under normal growth conditions E2F transcription factors are constitutively active and promote the G1 to S transition. Despite this, ionizing radiation induces a robust G1 arrest in these cells, indicating that the DNA damage checkpoint pathway can override the proliferative drive from E2F activity in an Rb-independent manner.\n\nIonizing radiation causes DNA double-strand breaks. The canonical response begins with activation of the damage-sensing kinases (not listed among the options), which stabilize and activate the p53 tumor suppressor protein by phosphorylation and release from its negative regulator. Activated p53 functions as a transcription factor that induces expression of CDKN1A, which encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. p21 directly inhibits G1/S cyclin-dependent kinases, including cyclin D–CDK4/6 and cyclin E–CDK2, thereby preventing the G1 to S transition. Even in the absence of Rb, p21-mediated CDK inhibition can enforce G1 arrest by suppressing CDK activity required for S-phase entry and by promoting Rb-family-independent repression of cell cycle gene expression through the DREAM complex. Thus, the most critical upstream activator of the arrest pathway in response to DNA damage, among the given choices, is p53.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Maturation-Promoting Factor (cyclin B–CDK1) regulates G2/M and is not the G1 DNA damage checkpoint activator.\n- Cyclin D promotes, rather than arrests, G1 progression and is not a damage-activated upstream component.\n- The Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome regulates metaphase–anaphase transition and mitotic exit, not the G1 DNA damage checkpoint.\n- p53 is the central upstream activator of the G1 DNA damage checkpoint via induction of p21.\n- E2F is a downstream driver of S-phase gene expression and is not an activator of G1 arrest.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is p53.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2312600"}, {"introduction": "Ensuring that each daughter cell receives a perfect set of chromosomes is a primary goal of mitosis. This practice focuses on the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC), the elegant surveillance system that prevents errors in chromosome segregation. By examining the consequences of a non-functional SAC, you will see how a single protein defect can lead to aneuploidy, a hallmark of many cancers and genetic disorders. [@problem_id:1517254]", "problem": "In a cell biology laboratory, a line of cultured mammalian cells is found to exhibit a significantly high rate of aneuploidy, a condition characterized by an abnormal number of chromosomes in daughter cells following mitosis. Genetic sequencing reveals that these cells harbor a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the gene that codes for the Mad2 (Mitotic Arrest Deficient 2) protein, rendering the protein completely non-functional.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate molecular explanation for the high frequency of aneuploidy observed in this cell line?\n\nA. The cells fail to arrest their progression into anaphase, even when chromosomes are not correctly attached to the mitotic spindle.\n\nB. The cells become permanently arrested in metaphase because the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) can no longer be activated.\n\nC. The cells are unable to pass the G1/S checkpoint, leading to errors during the initiation of DNA replication.\n\nD. The cohesin proteins holding sister chromatids together become hyper-stabilized, preventing the chromatids from separating during anaphase.\n\nE. The initial condensation of chromatin to form visible chromosomes during prophase is inhibited.", "solution": "Mad2 is a core component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which monitors kinetochore attachment to spindle microtubules and tension across sister chromatids. The SAC prevents premature anaphase onset by inhibiting the activation of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) via sequestration of its co-activator Cdc20 when any kinetochore is unattached or improperly attached. Mechanistically, Mad2 participates in forming the mitotic checkpoint complex that binds and inhibits Cdc20, thereby blocking APC/C-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of securin and cyclin B. As long as the SAC is active, separase remains inhibited by securin, cohesin remains intact, and cells are held in metaphase until all chromosomes achieve proper bipolar attachment.\n\nA homozygous loss-of-function mutation in Mad2 abolishes this checkpoint function. Without Mad2, unattached or improperly attached kinetochores cannot generate a robust SAC signal, Cdc20 is not inhibited, APC/C becomes inappropriately active, securin and cyclin B are degraded prematurely, separase is activated, cohesin is cleaved, and anaphase proceeds even when not all chromosomes are correctly attached. This leads to frequent chromosome mis-segregation and thus a high rate of aneuploidy. Therefore, failure to arrest progression into anaphase in the presence of incorrect attachments is the correct molecular explanation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is correct: loss of Mad2 disables the SAC, so cells fail to arrest prior to anaphase despite unattached or misattached chromosomes, causing aneuploidy.\n- B is incorrect: loss of Mad2 does not prevent APC/C activation; it removes inhibition, promoting premature APC/C activation rather than metaphase arrest.\n- C is incorrect: Mad2 functions in the mitotic checkpoint, not the G1/S checkpoint; G1/S defects are unrelated to the SAC-mediated aneuploidy described.\n- D is incorrect: hyper-stabilization of cohesin would prevent chromatid separation and cause metaphase arrest, not premature anaphase and aneuploidy from mis-segregation.\n- E is incorrect: chromatin condensation is regulated by condensins and mitotic kinases, not Mad2; Mad2 loss does not specifically inhibit prophase condensation.\n\nThus, the most accurate explanation is that the cells fail to arrest before anaphase despite improper kinetochore-microtubule attachment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1517254"}]}
