{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The division of the cytoplasm, or cytokinesis, represents a fundamental fork in the evolutionary road for animal and plant cells. This first practice invites you to explore this divergence by considering the primary cytoskeletal machinery each kingdom employs. By predicting the effects of a hypothetical drug that targets actin polymerization, you will directly engage with the central distinction between the animal cell's actin-based contractile ring and the plant cell's microtubule-based phragmoplast [@problem_id:2289322].", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is studying the process of cell division. They have developed a new synthetic compound, named Cytofreeze-A, which specifically binds to globular actin (G-actin) monomers and prevents them from polymerizing into filamentous actin (F-actin). To investigate its effects, they prepare two separate synchronized cell cultures that are progressing through the cell cycle together. The first culture consists of human fibroblasts, a type of animal cell. The second culture consists of cells from the meristematic tissue of an onion root tip, a type of plant cell. Just as the cells in both cultures begin telophase, the researchers add a sufficient concentration of Cytofreeze-A to each culture.\n\nBased on the known mechanisms of cytokinesis in these two cell types, which of the following outcomes is the most likely and direct consequence of adding Cytofreeze-A?\n\nA. Cytokinesis will be more directly and profoundly inhibited in the human fibroblasts, as the formation of the actin-based contractile ring required for cleavage furrow formation will be blocked.\n\nB. Cytokinesis will be more directly and profoundly inhibited in the onion root tip cells, as the construction of the microtubule-based phragmoplast is initiated by an actin scaffold.\n\nC. Cytokinesis will be inhibited with equal severity in both cell types, because actin-dependent vesicle transport is the primary mechanism for delivering new membrane and wall components in both processes.\n\nD. Cytokinesis will proceed normally in both cell types, as the primary cytoskeletal element responsible for chromosome separation and cytokinesis is tubulin, not actin.\n\nE. Both cell types will be arrested, but not due to an effect on cytokinesis. Instead, the lack of actin polymerization will cause a catastrophic collapse of the entire cytoskeleton, leading to immediate cell death (apoptosis).", "solution": "Cytofreeze-A binds to globular actin monomers and prevents their polymerization into filamentous actin. Therefore, its direct cellular effect is to inhibit the formation of F-actin structures while leaving microtubules and their dynamics unaffected.\n\nIn animal cytokinesis, exemplified by human fibroblasts, the essential mechanism is the formation and constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring at the cell equator. This ring is composed of F-actin and myosin II and generates the force that drives cleavage furrow ingression. If F-actin polymerization is blocked, the contractile ring cannot assemble, the cleavage furrow fails to form or constrict, and cytokinesis is directly and profoundly inhibited. Thus, fibroblast cytokinesis is highly sensitive to actin polymerization inhibitors.\n\nIn plant cytokinesis, exemplified by onion root tip meristem cells, cytokinesis proceeds via formation of a phragmoplast, a microtubule- and microtubule-associated protein-based structure derived from the midzone of the mitotic spindle. The phragmoplast guides Golgi-derived vesicles to the cell equator, where they fuse to form the cell plate that expands centrifugally to join the parental cell wall. This delivery and assembly are primarily organized by microtubules and kinesin motors. Although actin filaments can contribute to vesicle trafficking and later stages of cell plate expansion and maturation, initial phragmoplast formation and early cell plate assembly are not initiated by an actin scaffold. Therefore, blocking actin polymerization is less directly disruptive to the core plant cytokinesis machinery than it is to animal cytokinesis.\n\nConsequently, the most direct and profound inhibition of cytokinesis upon addition of Cytofreeze-A at telophase will occur in the human fibroblasts due to failure of the actin-based contractile ring. The alternative options are inconsistent with known mechanisms: initiation of the phragmoplast is microtubule-based rather than actin-based, actin-dependent vesicle transport is not the primary driver in both systems, tubulin does not negate the essential role of actin in animal cytokinesis, and immediate global cytoskeletal collapse and apoptosis are not the expected specific outcomes of inhibiting actin polymerization at telophase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2289322"}, {"introduction": "Having established the critical role of actin filaments in animal cell cytokinesis, we now turn our attention to the molecular motor that powers the contraction. The force that pinches one cell into two is generated by non-muscle myosin II, an enzyme that converts the chemical energy of ATP into mechanical work. This problem challenges you to deduce the cellular consequences of inhibiting this motor, providing a direct link between a specific molecular action and the large-scale morphological event of cell cleavage [@problem_id:1480887].", "problem": "A cell biology researcher is investigating cytokinesis in a synchronized culture of animal fibroblasts. The cells progress normally through prophase, metaphase, and anaphase. As the cells begin telophase, the researcher adds a novel drug, Blebbistatin-X, to the culture medium. This drug is a highly specific, non-competitive inhibitor of the Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis activity of the non-muscle myosin II motor protein. The drug does not interfere with the polymerization of actin filaments or the assembly of the mitotic spindle. After 90 minutes of incubation with Blebbistatin-X, the researcher observes the cells using light microscopy.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions represents the most probable phenotype of the majority of cells in the culture?\n\nA. The cells are arrested in anaphase, with sister chromatids unable to fully separate to opposite poles.\n\nB. The cells are smaller than control cells and contain only half the standard chromosomal content.\n\nC. A distinct cleavage furrow forms and fully ingresses, but the resulting daughter cells fail to detach from one another, forming a long chain of cells.\n\nD. The cells appear abnormally large and contain two distinct nuclei situated within a single, continuous cytoplasm.\n\nE. The cells successfully divide, but the distribution of organelles into the daughter cells is severely imbalanced.", "solution": "We proceed by identifying the specific molecular target and its role in cytokinesis, then deducing the cellular phenotype when this function is inhibited, and finally evaluating each option against these mechanistic predictions.\n\n1. Target and mechanism:\n- The drug Blebbistatin-X is a non-competitive inhibitor of the ATP hydrolysis activity of non-muscle myosin II. For an enzyme following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the velocity of ATP hydrolysis is\n$$\nv=\\frac{V_{\\max}[ATP]}{K_{m}+[ATP]}.\n$$\nUnder non-competitive inhibition, $V_{\\max}$ is reduced to $\\alpha V_{\\max}$ with $0<\\alpha<1$, while $K_{m}$ remains unchanged. The problem states the inhibitor is highly specific and non-competitive, implying a substantial reduction in $V_{\\max}$.\n- Myosin II generates contractile force by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes. The force available for contractile ring constriction is proportional to the ATPase rate, so\n$$\nF \\propto v.\n$$\nThus, with strong non-competitive inhibition, $v$ is greatly reduced and $F\\approx 0$.\n\n2. Cytokinesis requirements:\n- In animal cells, cytokinesis depends on assembly and constriction of the actomyosin contractile ring. Actin filaments polymerize at the equatorial cortex, and non-muscle myosin II uses ATP hydrolysis to slide actin filaments, generating tension and causing furrow ingression. The speed of furrow ingression $s$ is an increasing function of the contractile force, so\n$$\ns \\propto F.\n$$\nIf $F\\approx 0$, then $s\\approx 0$, and the furrow cannot effectively ingress.\n- The problem explicitly states that actin polymerization and spindle assembly are unaffected. Therefore, the contractile ring can assemble (actin filaments present), and karyokinesis (chromosome segregation by the mitotic spindle) proceeds normally through anaphase into telophase, but the ring cannot generate contractile force to complete cytokinesis.\n\n3. Timing and predicted phenotype:\n- Drug addition at the onset of telophase means chromosomes have already segregated and nuclei are beginning to reform. With myosin II ATPase inhibited, the cleavage furrow may be specified and ring components recruited, but ingression fails or stalls due to lack of force. Consequently, karyokinesis occurs without cytokinesis, producing a single, larger cell containing two distinct nuclei (a binucleate cell) within a continuous cytoplasm, persisting at the 90 minute observation time point.\n\n4. Evaluation of answer choices:\n- A: Anaphase arrest with failure of sister chromatid separation is unlikely. Chromatid segregation is driven by spindle microtubules and associated kinesin/dynein motors; the drug does not affect spindle assembly or microtubules. Additionally, the drug is added at telophase, after anaphase has occurred.\n- B: Smaller cells with half the chromosomal content implies successful cytokinesis and reduction of cell volume, which contradicts the predicted failure of furrow ingression with myosin II inhibition.\n- C: Full furrow ingression with failure of final detachment (abscission) suggests a defect in the ESCRT-mediated abscission machinery rather than in myosin II. Inhibiting myosin II ATPase prevents effective ingression in the first place; a fully ingressed furrow is not expected.\n- D: An abnormally large cell with two distinct nuclei in one continuous cytoplasm is the classic outcome of karyokinesis without cytokinesis (binucleation) and matches the predicted consequence of inhibiting myosin II during telophase.\n- E: Successful division with organelle imbalance implies cytokinesis completion but partitioning defects; here cytokinesis itself fails due to lack of contractile force, making this inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the most probable phenotype is binucleated cells within a single cytoplasm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1480887"}, {"introduction": "We know the contractile ring is made of actin and powered by myosin, but how does this machine operate over time? Is it a static structure that simply tightens like a purse-string, or is it more complex? This exercise introduces a classic experimental technique, Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), to investigate the dynamic nature of the ring. By predicting the outcome of this experiment, you will develop a more sophisticated and accurate model of the contractile ring as a continuously remodeling structure that exchanges subunits with the cytoplasm as it constricts [@problem_id:1480888].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the mechanism of cytokinesis in an animal cell line that has been genetically engineered to express a version of a non-muscle myosin II subunit fused with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). This fusion protein, Myosin-GFP, incorporates into the contractile ring and renders it fluorescent. The biologist observes a cell in an early stage of cytokinesis, with a clearly visible and uniformly bright fluorescent contractile ring forming at the equatorial plate.\n\nUsing a targeted laser, the biologist photobleaches a small, specific segment of the contractile ring, rendering the Myosin-GFP molecules in that segment non-fluorescent and creating a dark gap in the otherwise bright ring. The cell is not damaged and continues to proceed with division.\n\nAssuming that the contractile ring is a highly dynamic structure that undergoes constant disassembly and reassembly by incorporating new subunits from a cytoplasmic pool throughout the process of constriction, which of the following outcomes is expected to be observed in the minutes following the photobleaching event?\n\nA. The fluorescence in the bleached segment will gradually reappear, and the entire ring will continue to constrict.\n\nB. The bleached segment will remain dark, and the two bright, fluorescent portions of the ring will be pulled closer together as if it were a static purse-string, eventually fusing as the dark segment is effectively 'squeezed out'.\n\nC. The bleached segment will remain dark, and the cell will be unable to complete cytokinesis, arresting at its current state.\n\nD. The entire ring, including both the bleached and unbleached portions, will progressively and uniformly lose its fluorescence until it is no longer visible.\n\nE. The bleached segment will move along the circumference of the ring, similar to a bead on a rotating loop, while the ring constricts.", "solution": "The system consists of a contractile ring assembled from Myosin-GFP subunits that are fluorescent when unbleached. A targeted laser photobleaches a local segment, converting the fluorophores in that region to a non-fluorescent state without destroying the protein’s mechanical function, thereby creating a dark gap.\n\nBy assumption, the contractile ring is highly dynamic and undergoes continuous turnover: subunits disassemble from the ring and new subunits from a cytoplasmic pool assemble into it over time. This is the defining condition for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP): if unbleached, fluorescent subunits from a cytoplasmic pool exchange into the bleached region while bleached subunits are lost by turnover, the local fluorescence intensity in the bleached region will increase toward the pre-bleach level.\n\nLogical consequences of the stated assumption:\n- Continuous disassembly and reassembly implies that the identity of the specific molecules at a given position in the ring changes over time due to exchange with the cytoplasmic pool.\n- Since the cytoplasmic pool contains unbleached Myosin-GFP, incorporation will restore fluorescence in the previously bleached segment.\n- Photobleaching does not remove or inhibit the mechanical function of the ring as a whole; it only removes fluorescence in the targeted molecules. Therefore, cytokinesis proceeds, and the ring continues to constrict.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A matches FRAP expectations under dynamic turnover: fluorescence reappears in the bleached segment due to exchange with unbleached subunits, and constriction continues.\n- B requires a static, non-exchanging “purse-string” where the bleached mark persists and is advected; this contradicts the assumed high turnover and would not show fluorescence recovery.\n- C is inconsistent because photobleaching does not prevent myosin function and exchange replenishes the ring; cytokinesis should proceed.\n- D would require global photobleaching or widespread photodestruction; a localized bleach with ongoing turnover does not cause uniform loss of fluorescence across the entire ring.\n- E suggests persistent advection of a bleached mark; under rapid exchange with a fluorescent pool, the bleached mark dissipates rather than moving as a stable bead.\n\nTherefore, the expected observation is fluorescence recovery in the bleached segment while the ring continues to constrict.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1480888"}]}
