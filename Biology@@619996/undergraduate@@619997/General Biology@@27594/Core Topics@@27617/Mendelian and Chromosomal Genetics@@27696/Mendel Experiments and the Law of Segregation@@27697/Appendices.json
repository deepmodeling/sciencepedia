Mastering this skill is crucial for understanding genetic screening and designing effective breeding programs.", "problem": "A biotechnology firm is developing a new variety of corn engineered to produce a key precursor for a novel anti-inflammatory drug. The ability to produce this compound is controlled by a single gene with two alleles. The allele for production, denoted as `C`, is completely dominant over the allele for non-production, `c`.\n\nTo propagate the line, two heterozygous corn plants (`Cc`) are crossed. A single seed is randomly selected from the resulting F2 generation offspring. This seed is germinated and carefully nurtured into a mature plant. Upon analysis, the plant is confirmed to be a producer of the medicinal compound.\n\nGiven that the plant exhibits the dominant, producing phenotype, what is the probability that it is heterozygous (`Cc`) and is therefore a carrier of the non-producing allele? Express your answer as an exact fraction.", "solution": "The trait is determined by a single gene with two alleles, with complete dominance of $C$ over $c$.

This problem extends the principles to a dihybrid cross, requiring you to apply both the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment in a scenario where one genotype is non-viable [@problem_id:2302830].

Two key traits are governed by simple Mendelian genetics. The first gene controls leaf pigmentation, where the allele for red leaves ($R$) is completely dominant over the allele for yellow leaves ($r$). The second gene, which assorts independently from the leaf color gene, controls the production of a cryoprotectant protein. The allele for protein production ($C$), which confers frost resistance, is dominant over the allele for no protein production ($c$).\n\nHowever, there is a complication: the homozygous dominant genotype for cryoprotectant production ($CC$) is lethal early in embryonic development, and any seed with this genotype will fail to germinate.\n\nA researcher performs a cross between two *Vallesia paradoxa* plants, both of which have red leaves and are frost-resistant. Genetic analysis reveals that both parent plants are heterozygous for both traits.\n\nCalculate the probability that a seed from this cross that successfully germinates will grow into a plant with yellow leaves and no frost resistance.

This advanced problem introduces genomic imprinting, an epigenetic phenomenon where an allele is silenced depending on which parent it was inherited from [@problem_id:2302797]. You will explore how this non-Mendelian mechanism produces a unique and identifiable pattern of inheritance, demonstrating the power of experimental design in distinguishing between different genetic hypotheses.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying the inheritance of petal color in a newly discovered flowering plant, *Flores speculativa*. The petal color is determined by a single gene with two alleles: `B` for blue petals and `b` for white petals. The geneticist has access to two pure-breeding (homozygous) lines of the plant: one with blue petals (`BB`) and one with white petals (`bb`). For this plant, the ovule parent is considered the female parent and the pollen parent is considered the male parent.\n\nTwo competing hypotheses are proposed to explain the inheritance of this trait:\n\nHypothesis A: The trait follows standard Mendelian genetics, where `B` is a simple dominant allele and `b` is a recessive allele.\n\nHypothesis B: The gene locus is subject to paternal genomic imprinting. This means that the allele inherited from the pollen-donating (paternal) parent is epigenetically silenced and is not expressed in the offspring. When an allele is expressed, `B` is dominant over `b`.\n\nTo distinguish between these hypotheses, the geneticist performs a key experiment. A cross is made using a pure-breeding white-petaled plant as the ovule parent and a pure-breeding blue-petaled plant as the pollen parent. The resulting F1 generation plants are then allowed to self-pollinate to create an F2 generation.\n\nAssuming Hypothesis B is correct, what is the expected phenotypic ratio of blue-petaled to white-petaled plants in this F2 generation? The answer should be a row matrix containing two integers representing the simplified ratio of (Blue Phenotypes : White Phenotypes).", "solution": "Define alleles: $B$ encodes blue, $b$ encodes white, with $B$ dominant over $b$ when an allele is expressed. Under Hypothesis B (paternal genomic imprinting), in every offspring the allele inherited from the pollen (paternal) parent is epigenetically silenced; only the allele inherited from the ovule (maternal) parent is expressed.\n\nInitial cross: ovule parent $bb$ (white) $\\times$ pollen parent $BB$ (blue). All F1 zygotes have genotype $Bb$ because each inherits $b$ from the ovule parent and $B$ from the pollen parent. In these F1, the paternal allele ($B$) is silenced; the maternal allele ($b$) is expressed, so all F1 are white.\n\nSelfing the F1: An F1 individual of genotype $Bb$ produces gametes with allele $B$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and allele $b$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, regardless of imprinting, because imprinting affects expression in the offspring, not transmission probabilities. When two F1 self, the F2 genotypes follow Mendelian segregation:\n$$\n\\text{Genotypes: } \\quad \\frac{1}{4}BB,\\quad \\frac{1}{2}Bb,\\quad \\frac{1}{4}bb.\n$$\nHowever, under paternal imprinting, in each F2 individual the paternal allele is silenced and the phenotype depends solely on the maternal allele inherited from the ovule parent in that F2 cross. The ovule alleles from an F1 female are $B$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $b$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore:\n- If the maternal allele is $B$ (probability $\\frac{1}{2}$), the expressed allele is $B$, yielding a blue phenotype.\n- If the maternal allele is $b$ (probability $\\frac{1}{2}$), the expressed allele is $b$, yielding a white phenotype.\n\nThus, the expected phenotypic proportions in the F2 are blue $\\frac{1}{2}$ and white $\\frac{1}{2}$, i.e., a simplified ratio of $1:1$.\n\nTherefore, the required row matrix for (Blue : White) is\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2302797"}]}
