This exercise offers a direct comparison by examining two different genes in a single organism.

Plants with genotype $P^F P^F$ produce only the 'Fast' migrating protein isoform. Plants with genotype $P^S P^S$ produce only the 'Slow' migrating protein isoform.

The Rhesus (Rh) blood group system is determined by a separate gene with two alleles: $R$ (for Rh-positive) and $r$ (for Rh-negative), where $R$ is completely dominant over $r$. Assume these two genes assort independently.\n\nA man has type A, Rh-positive blood. His father had type B, Rh-negative blood, and his mother had type A, Rh-positive blood.
