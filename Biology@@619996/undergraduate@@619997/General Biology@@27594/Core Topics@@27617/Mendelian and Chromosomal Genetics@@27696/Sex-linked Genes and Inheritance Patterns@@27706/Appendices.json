This first practice problem takes us back to these fundamentals, presenting a classic genetic cross with a seemingly counterintuitive outcome.

The allele for wild-type red eyes is dominant over the allele for mutant white eyes. A geneticist conducts an experiment by mating a female fruit fly that has red eyes with a male fruit fly that has white eyes. After the eggs hatch, the geneticist observes the F1 generation and finds, among other offspring, several female flies that have white eyes.\n\nLet $X^R$ represent the dominant allele for red eyes and $X^r$ represent the recessive allele for white eyes.

It is impossible to determine from the information given.", "solution": "Eye color in Drosophila is X-linked with red ($X^{R}$) dominant over white ($X^{r}$). The male parent has white eyes and is therefore hemizygous recessive with genotype $X^{r}Y$, since males are $XY$ and a white-eyed phenotype requires the single X to carry $X^{r}$. The female parent has red eyes, so her genotype must include at least one $X^{R}$. The possible genotypes for a red-eyed female are $X^{R}X^{R}$ or $X^{R}X^{r}$; the genotype $X^{r}X^{r}$ would produce white eyes and is inconsistent with the given phenotype, and $X^{R}Y$ is not a valid genotype for a female.\n\nAll daughters inherit the father’s X chromosome, which in this case is $X^{r}$. Therefore, every F1 daughter has the form $X^{r}X^{?}$, where the second X comes from the mother. For any F1 daughter to exhibit white eyes, her genotype must be $X^{r}X^{r}$, which requires that the mother contributes an $X^{r}$ gamete. Consequently, the mother must carry the $X^{r}$ allele. Combined with her red-eyed phenotype (which requires at least one $X^{R}$), the mother’s genotype must be $X^{R}X^{r}$.\n\nThus, the complete genotype of the P generation mother is $X^{R}X^{r}$, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2314338"}, {"introduction": "Genetics often resembles detective work, where clues from different biological levels are pieced together to solve a complex case. This problem challenges you to do just that, by analyzing a scenario involving two distinct genetic conditions: hemophilia, an X-linked recessive disorder, and Turner syndrome, a chromosomal aneuploidy. Your task is to use the inheritance pattern of the single-gene disorder as a marker to deduce the specific meiotic error that led to the chromosomal condition, highlighting the powerful interplay between Mendelian genetics and cytogenetics.", "problem": "Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, and it is known to be an X-linked recessive trait. For an individual to have normal blood clotting, they must possess at least one copy of the dominant allele, which we can denote as $X^H$. The recessive allele, $X^h$, causes hemophilia. Turner syndrome is a condition that results from a chromosomal abnormality in which a female is born with only one X chromosome, giving them a karyotype of XO. This abnormality is caused by a meiotic nondisjunction event in one of the parents, which results in a gamete (sperm or egg) that lacks a sex chromosome.\n\nA genetics clinic is analyzing the case of a young girl who has been diagnosed with both Turner syndrome and hemophilia. A review of her family history shows that both of her biological parents have a normal blood clotting phenotype.\n\nBased on this information, determine which parent experienced the meiotic nondisjunction event that led to the daughter's XO karyotype.\n\nA. The mother\n\nB. The father\n\nC. It could have occurred in either parent, and it is impossible to distinguish.\n\nD. The scenario as described is genetically impossible.", "solution": "Hemophilia is X-linked recessive. Let $X^{H}$ denote the normal allele and $X^{h}$ the hemophilia allele. A person with at least one $X^{H}$ on the X chromosome(s) is phenotypically normal; a male with $X^{h}Y$ or a female with $X^{h}X^{h}$ expresses hemophilia.\n\nTurner syndrome ($XO$) arises when a zygote receives one X chromosome and no second sex chromosome. This occurs when one parent contributes a gamete lacking a sex chromosome, denoted $O$.\n\nThe girl is $XO$ and has hemophilia. For hemophilia in an $XO$ individual, the single X must carry the recessive allele, so her genotype must be\n$$\nX^{h}O.\n$$\nBoth parents are phenotypically normal. Therefore, the father must have genotype $X^{H}Y$ (a normal male cannot be $X^{h}Y$), and the mother must be either $X^{H}X^{H}$ or $X^{H}X^{h}$ (a normal female could be non-carrier or carrier).\n\nDetermine which parent produced the $O$ gamete by case analysis:\n\n1) If the nondisjunction occurred in the mother, she could produce an $O$ egg. The father would then contribute his X-bearing sperm, which is necessarily $X^{H}$. The resulting zygote would be\n$$\nX^{H}O,\n$$\nwhich is phenotypically normal for clotting. This contradicts the observed hemophilia.\n\n2) If the nondisjunction occurred in the father, he could produce an $O$ sperm. The mother would then contribute the single X. To match the observed hemophilia, the maternal X must be $X^{h}$, giving\n$$\nX^{h}O,\n$$\nwhich is an $XO$ individual with hemophilia. This is possible if the mother is a carrier $X^{H}X^{h}$, consistent with her normal phenotype.\n\nTherefore, only paternal nondisjunction can produce an $XO$ daughter who is hemophiliac, given both parents are phenotypically normal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2314344"}, {"introduction": "Genetic knowledge is rarely absolute; it often exists in the realm of probabilities that can be updated as new information becomes available. This final practice brings this principle to life by introducing a scenario common in genetic counseling, where we must revise the probability of an individual being a carrier for an X-linked recessive disorder. You will apply Bayes' theorem to integrate new evidence—the health of subsequent offspring—to refine an initial genetic risk assessment, demonstrating a powerful quantitative tool used in modern personalized medicine.", "problem": "A specific form of congenital amaurosis, a condition leading to severe vision impairment, is known to be inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. A phenotypically normal woman seeks genetic counseling. Her mother is a confirmed carrier of the trait, and her father is phenotypically normal. Based on this information alone, the a priori probability that the woman is a carrier is 0.5. The woman and her partner, who is phenotypically normal, have had three sons, all of whom are also phenotypically normal.\n\nCalculate the revised probability that the woman is a carrier for congenital amaurosis, given the evidence of her three healthy sons. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let's define the alleles for the trait. Let $X^A$ represent the dominant allele for normal vision and $X^a$ represent the recessive allele for congenital amaurosis.\n\nA carrier woman has the genotype $X^A X^a$. A non-carrier, phenotypically normal woman has the genotype $X^A X^A$. Since the woman is phenotypically normal, she cannot have the genotype $X^a X^a$.\n\nWe are asked to find the posterior probability that the woman is a carrier, given the new evidence of her having three healthy sons. This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet's define the following events:\n- $C$: The event that the woman is a carrier (genotype $X^A X^a$).\n- $N$: The event that the woman is a non-carrier (genotype $X^A X^A$).\n- $E$: The evidence, which is the event that the woman has three healthy sons.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the prior probabilities:\n$P(C) = 0.5$\n$P(N) = 1 - P(C) = 0.5$\n\nWe want to find the posterior probability $P(C|E)$, which is the probability that the woman is a carrier given the evidence $E$. Bayes' theorem states:\n$$P(C|E) = \\frac{P(E|C) P(C)}{P(E)}$$\n\nTo use this formula, we first need to calculate the conditional probabilities of the evidence, known as the likelihoods.\n1.  $P(E|C)$: The probability of having three healthy sons if the woman is a carrier ($X^A X^a$). A son inherits his Y chromosome from his father and one X chromosome from his mother. If the mother is a carrier, there is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance she passes on the $X^A$ allele (resulting in a healthy son, $X^A Y$) and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance she passes on the $X^a$ allele (resulting in an affected son, $X^a Y$). The events of each birth are independent. Therefore, the probability of having three healthy sons is:\n    $$P(E|C) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$$\n2.  $P(E|N)$: The probability of having three healthy sons if the woman is a non-carrier ($X^A X^A$). If the mother is a non-carrier, she can only pass on the $X^A$ allele. Thus, any son she has will be healthy ($X^A Y$). The probability of having one healthy son is 1. For three sons, the probability is:\n    $$P(E|N) = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^3 = 1$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total probability of the evidence, $P(E)$, using the law of total probability:\n$$P(E) = P(E|C)P(C) + P(E|N)P(N)$$\nSubstituting the values we have:\n$$P(E) = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)(0.5) + (1)(0.5)$$\n$$P(E) = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{9}{16}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the posterior probability $P(C|E)$:\n$$P(C|E) = \\frac{P(E|C) P(C)}{P(E)} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\frac{9}{16}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{16}}{\\frac{9}{16}}$$\n$$P(C|E) = \\frac{1}{9}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$$P(C|E) = \\frac{1}{9} \\approx 0.11111...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $0.111$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.111}$$", "id": "2314367"}]}
