{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first exercise focuses on the foundational principle of genetic linkage analysis using a two-gene test cross. The frequencies of offspring phenotypes directly reflect the frequencies of gametes produced by the heterozygous parent; the most common phenotypes arise from parental (non-recombinant) gametes, while the rarest come from recombinant gametes. By analyzing the progeny counts from this hypothetical cross, you will practice the critical skill of identifying parental versus recombinant classes to deduce the arrangement of alleles on the chromosomes of the F1 generation [@problem_id:2286680].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying the inheritance of two traits in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*: body color and wing shape. The gene for body color has a dominant allele *B* for a grey body and a recessive allele *b* for a black body. The gene for wing shape has a dominant allele *V* for normal wings and a recessive allele *v* for vestigial wings.\n\nThe experiment begins by crossing two different true-breeding (homozygous) parental fly strains (P generation). All flies in the resulting F1 generation exhibit a grey body and normal wings.\n\nNext, an F1 female is subjected to a test cross with a male fly that has a black body and vestigial wings. The phenotypes of 1000 offspring from this test cross were recorded as follows:\n- Grey body, normal wings: 98\n- Black body, vestigial wings: 102\n- Grey body, vestigial wings: 404\n- Black body, normal wings: 396\n\nBased on these results, what were the genotypes of the two original true-breeding parental (P generation) strains?\n\nA. *BBVV* and *bbvv*\n\nB. *BBvv* and *bbVV*\n\nC. *BbVv* and *BbVv*\n\nD. *BBVV* and *BBvv*\n\nE. *bbvv* and *bbVV*", "solution": "Both traits show complete dominance: *B* (grey) over *b* (black) and *V* (normal) over *v* (vestigial). All F1 flies are grey with normal wings, and the test cross yields all four phenotypic classes, so the F1 must be a double heterozygote *BbVv*.\n\nIn a test cross *BbVv* $\\times$ *bbvv*, each offspring phenotype reveals directly the gamete from the F1 female. The two most frequent classes are the nonrecombinant (parental) gametes; the two least frequent are recombinants. From the data: grey vestigial (*Bv*) are $404$ and black normal (*bV*) are $396$, which are the largest classes, while grey normal (*BV*) are $98$ and black vestigial (*bv*) are $102$, which are the smallest. Therefore, the F1 female’s coupling phase is *Bv*/*bV*, meaning her two homologous chromosomes carry *Bv* and *bV*.\n\nSince the F1 arose from crossing two homozygous true-breeding parents, each parental strain contributed one of these haplotypes exclusively. Thus one parent must have been *BBvv* (producing only *Bv* gametes) and the other *bbVV* (producing only *bV* gametes). This corresponds to option B.

The resulting F1 generation was uniformly heterozygous for all three genes.\n\nTo map these genes, an F1 individual was then test-crossed with a homozygous recessive individual (yellow fruit, dwarf stems, hairy leaves).

Compare *R t S* (parental) with *R T S* (DCO): only the *T* locus flips ($t \\to T$) while *R* and *S* remain the same. Similarly, compare *r T s* (parental) with *r t s* (DCO): only *T* flips. Therefore *T* is the middle gene, and the order is *R - T - S*.\n\nStep 3: Classify single crossovers (SCOs) by interval given order *R - T - S*.
