Through a series of genetic crosses, the geneticist determines the following recombination frequencies between these genes:\n\n- The recombination frequency between gene *coloratus* ($C$) and gene *folium* ($F$) is 18%.\n- The recombination frequency between gene *folium* ($F$) and gene *statur* ($S$) is 23%.\n\nBased on this data alone, the linear order of these three genes on the chromosome cannot be definitively determined.

Here $F$ is in the middle, so the adjacent recombination fractions are exactly $r_{CF}=0.18$ and $r_{FS}=0.23$. This matches the given values directly. Therefore, this order is consistent.\n\n2) Order $F$-$C$-$S$ (or its reverse $S$-$C$-$F$). Here $C$ is in the middle. Then $r_{FC}=0.18$ is adjacent and satisfied. The other adjacent distance $r_{CS}$ is unknown, while the end-to-end recombination fraction $r_{FS}$ must satisfy\n$$\nr_{FS}=r_{FC}+r_{CS}-2 r_{FC} r_{CS}.\n$$\nWe are given $r_{FS}=0.23$ and $r_{FC}=0.18$, so this equation can be solved for some $r_{CS}\\in[0,0.5]$ (indeed, setting $r_{CS}$ near $0.05$ satisfies the relation). Hence this order is also consistent with the data.\n\n3) Order $C$-$S$-$F$ (or its reverse $F$-$S$-$C$). Here $S$ is in the middle and the adjacent recombination fractions are $r_{CS}$ and $r_{SF}=0.23$.

Therefore, any order with $S$ in the middle is impossible.\n\nFrom these cases, the two possible linear arrangements (up to reversal) are the ones with $F$ in the middle and with $C$ in the middle.
