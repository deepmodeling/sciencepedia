A standard dihybrid cross is performed: two true-breeding lines are crossed to produce a heterozygous F1, which is then selfed to give F2. The observed F2 phenotypic ratio is 13 non-fluorescent to 3 fluorescent.\n\nFirst, identify the gene interaction that yields a 13:3 F2 phenotypic ratio under independent assortment. The canonical epistasis pattern that produces a 13:3 ratio is dominant inhibitory (also called dominant suppression) epistasis. In this model, a dominant allele at one locus (let it be A) suppresses the expression of the other locus (B). Let B be the locus that can produce fluorescence, but only when it is not suppressed by A. Thus, the fluorescence phenotype occurs only when there is no suppressor allele present (genotype at A is aa) and there is at least one dominant allele at B (genotype at B is BB or Bb). Symbolically, define fluorescence as occurring if and only if the event\n$$\n\\{A = aa\\} \\cap \\{B \\neq bb\\}\n$$\nholds; all other genotypes are non-fluorescent due to either suppression by $A$ or the absence of a dominant $B$ allele.\n\nUnder a selfed dihybrid cross with independent assortment, each locus segregates as\n$$\nP(AA) = \\frac{1}{4},\\quad P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4},\n$$\nand similarly at the B locus. Independence implies\n$$\nP(\\text{fluorescent}) = P(aa)\\cdot P(B \\neq bb) = \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{16},\n$$\nand therefore\n$$\nP(\\text{non-fluorescent}) = 1 - \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}.\n$$\nThis reproduces exactly the observed $13:3$ non-fluorescent:fluorescent ratio, confirming dominant inhibitory epistasis with the phenotype rule given above.\n\nNext, determine phenotypes of the true-breeding parents and the F1 that are consistent with this scheme. We require true-breeding parents that produce an $F1$ with genotype $AaBb$. One convenient choice is the cross of `AABB` with `aabb`. Under dominant suppression, `AABB` is non-fluorescent (because the dominant suppressor `A` is present) and `aabb` is non-fluorescent (because `bb` lacks the dominant `B` function). Their $F1$ offspring are all $AaBb$, which are non-fluorescent because the dominant suppressor `A` is present. Selfing $AaBb$ then gives the $F2$ ratio computed above.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is dominant inhibitory epistasis with both true-breeding parents non-fluorescent and the heterozygous F1 non-fluorescent, which matches option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2293720"}, {"introduction": "Many important traits, such as height, weight, or crop yield, don't fall into neat categories but instead show continuous variation.
