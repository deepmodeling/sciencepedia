This first practice focuses on a classic Mendelian monohybrid cross, where a single gene with a dominant and a recessive allele controls a trait. By tracking these alleles from the parental generation to the F2 generation, you will apply the fundamental principles of segregation to predict the expected genotypic outcomes of a cross, a core skill for any genetic analysis.

The allele for a yellow fruiting body, denoted by $Y$, is completely dominant over the allele for a white fruiting body, denoted by $y$.\n\nA geneticist initiates an experiment by crossing a slime mold from a pure-breeding (homozygous) yellow-bodied population with a slime mold from a pure-breeding white-bodied population. The resulting offspring constitute the F1 generation. Following this, two randomly selected individuals from the F1 generation are crossed to produce an F2 generation, which consists of a total of 852 individual slime molds.\n\nAssuming the cross follows standard Mendelian inheritance patterns and there are no other influencing factors, what is the expected number of individuals in the F2 generation that will be heterozygous for the fruiting body color gene?", "solution": "Let the alleles be $Y$ (dominant) and $y$ (recessive). A pure-breeding yellow individual has genotype $YY$, and a pure-breeding white individual has genotype $yy$.\n\nStep 1: Parental cross.

The second gene determines the color of the light produced, with the allele for blue light $B$ being dominant over the allele for green light $b$.\n\nThe expression of the color gene is an example of epistasis: a fungus with the genotype $ll$ will not produce any light, regardless of the alleles present for the color gene.
