This exercise [@problem_id:16181] challenges you to apply the Law of Independent Assortment directly to determine the probability of specific allele combinations in gametes. Mastering this skill is the first essential step in solving any multi-gene inheritance problem, reinforcing the use of the multiplication rule for independent events.", "problem": "In Mendelian genetics, an organism's traits are determined by genes, which come in different versions called alleles. For a given gene, an individual possesses a pair of alleles, one inherited from each parent. This pair of alleles is known as the genotype. For example, a plant might have a gene for seed shape with alleles for round seeds (R) and wrinkled seeds (r), and a gene for seed color with alleles for yellow seeds (Y) and green seeds (y). In this context, 'R' and 'Y' are dominant alleles, while 'r' and 'y' are recessive.\n\nDuring sexual reproduction, an organism produces gametes (e.g., pollen or egg cells), each containing only one allele from each gene pair. This is described by **Mendel's Law of Segregation**: the two alleles for a heritable character separate (segregate) during gamete formation, so that each gamete ends up with only one of the two alleles. For a heterozygous genotype like $Rr$, a gamete has an equal chance of receiving the 'R' allele or the 'r' allele.\n\nFurthermore, the inheritance of one gene is often independent of the inheritance of another. This is described by **Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment**: the alleles of genes for different traits segregate independently during the formation of gametes.\n\nConsider a plant with a genotype $RrYy$. Using the principles of probability and the laws described above, derive the probability that a gamete produced by this plant will contain both recessive alleles, $r$ and $y$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability of a gamete from an $RrYy$ parent having the genotype $ry$. Let's denote this as $P(\\text{ry})$.\n\nWe can break this down into two independent events based on the Law of Independent Assortment:\n1.  Event A: The gamete receives the $r$ allele from the $Rr$ gene pair.\n2.  Event B: The gamete receives the $y$ allele from the $Yy$ gene pair.\n\nThe overall probability we want to find is the probability of both Event A and Event B occurring, which can be written as $P(A \\cap B)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze Event A. The parent plant has the genotype $Rr$ for the seed shape gene. According to the Law of Segregation, the two alleles, 'R' and 'r', separate into gametes with equal likelihood.\nThe possible alleles a gamete can receive for this gene are {R, r}. The total number of possible outcomes is 2. The number of favorable outcomes (receiving the 'r' allele) is 1.\nTherefore, the probability of a gamete receiving the 'r' allele is:\n$$\nP(A) = P(\\text{r}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of 'r' alleles}}{\\text{Total number of alleles}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nNext, let's analyze Event B. The parent plant has the genotype $Yy$ for the seed color gene. According to the Law of Segregation, the two alleles, 'Y' and 'y', also separate into gametes with equal likelihood.\nThe possible alleles a gamete can receive for this gene are {Y, y}. The total number of possible outcomes is 2. The number of favorable outcomes (receiving the 'y' allele) is 1.\nTherefore, the probability of a gamete receiving the 'y' allele is:\n$$\nP(B) = P(\\text{y}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of 'y' alleles}}{\\text{Total number of alleles}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nThe Law of Independent Assortment tells us that Event A and Event B are independent. The multiplication rule for probability states that for two independent events, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\n$$\n\nSubstituting the probabilities we calculated:\n$$\nP(\\text{ry}) = P(\\text{r}) \\times P(\\text{y}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication gives the final result:\n$$\nP(\\text{ry}) = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\n$$", "id": "16181"}, {"introduction": "After understanding gamete formation, we can move to predicting the traits of offspring.

In this problem [@problem_id:2320419], you will calculate the expected phenotypic outcomes of a cross, a practice that will solidify your ability to use probability logic or a Punnett square to forecast genetic results and understand the origin of the classic $9:3:3:1$ ratio.", "problem": "In a controlled research environment, a biologist studies a species of ornamental flowering plant. Two traits are of particular interest: petal color and stem height. The gene for petal color has two alleles: the allele for purple petals ($P$) is completely dominant over the allele for white petals ($p$). The gene for stem height also has two alleles: the allele for tall stems ($T$) is completely dominant over the allele for dwarf stems ($t$). These two genes are located on different chromosomes and thus assort independently.\n\nA plant that is heterozygous for both petal color and stem height is self-pollinated. Assuming Mendelian inheritance patterns, what fraction of the resulting offspring are expected to have purple petals and dwarf stems?
