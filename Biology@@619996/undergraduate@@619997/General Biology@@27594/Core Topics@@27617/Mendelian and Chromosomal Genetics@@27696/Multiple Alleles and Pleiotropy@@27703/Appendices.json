This exercise will sharpen your ability to predict inheritance patterns when Mendelian ratios are modified by unique cellular interactions.", "problem": "In a species of ornamental cherry tree, a single gene locus, known as the S-locus, controls two distinct traits. The primary function of this locus is to regulate self-incompatibility, a mechanism that prevents self-fertilization. The incompatibility system is gametophytic, meaning the S-allele present in the haploid pollen grain must not match either of the two S-alleles present in the diploid tissue of the pistil for fertilization to occur.\n\nIn addition to its role in reproduction, the S-locus exhibits pleiotropy by also determining the flower's petal color. The petal color phenotypes associated with the different genotypes are as follows, showing a pattern of incomplete dominance:\n- $S_1S_1$: Deep Pink\n- $S_2S_2$: White\n- $S_3S_3$: Deep Red\n- $S_1S_2$: Light Pink\n- $S_1S_3$: Light Red\n- $S_2S_3$: Pale Red\n\nAn orchard manager performs a cross.

The human ABO blood group system provides a canonical example of such a relationship, known as epistasis. Although the $I$ locus determines the A, B, or O antigens, expression is dependent on a second gene, the $H$ locus, as explored in [@problem_id:1505141]. This problem challenges you to work like a genetic detective, using pedigree data to deduce the full two-locus genotypes of parents whose offspring reveal the presence of the rare Bombay phenotype ($hh$), an instance where one gene completely masks the effect of another.", "problem": "In human genetics, the ABO blood group is determined by a gene, designated as the I locus, which has three common alleles: $I^A$, $I^B$, and $i$. The alleles $I^A$ and $I^B$ are codominant, and both are completely dominant over the recessive allele $i$. The expression of the ABO blood group is controlled by a separate, unlinked gene known as the H locus. The dominant allele, $H$, codes for an enzyme that produces a precursor substance (Substance H) on the surface of red blood cells. The enzymes encoded by $I^A$ and $I^B$ modify this Substance H to produce A and B antigens, respectively. The recessive allele $i$ produces no functional enzyme.\n\nIndividuals with the homozygous recessive genotype, $hh$, cannot produce Substance H. Consequently, even if they possess the $I^A$ or $I^B$ alleles, they cannot produce A or B antigens. Their red blood cells lack A, B, and H antigens, causing them to test as blood type O. This epistatic interaction, where the $hh$ genotype masks the expression of the I locus alleles, is known as the Bombay phenotype.\n\nConsider a large family where the parental couple, a phenotypically normal man and woman, have had many children. A comprehensive genetic analysis of their offspring reveals the presence of children with all four standard ABO blood types (A, B, AB, and O), as well as at least one child with the rare Bombay phenotype.\n\nBased on this complete family history, determine the full genotypes of the two parents at both the I locus and the H locus.

Expression of A or B antigens requires at least one $H$ allele; the genotype $hh$ is epistatic and yields the Bombay phenotype, phenotypically O regardless of the I-locus genotype.\n\nFrom the family data:\n1) Presence of at least one Bombay child implies both parents must carry $h$ but are phenotypically normal. Therefore both parents must be $Hh$. Indeed, if either parent were $HH$, no child could be $hh$, and if either were $hh$, that parent would be Bombay, contradicting the description. Thus both parents are $Hh$, giving $\\Pr(hh)=\\frac{1}{4}$ among offspring.\n\n2) Presence of children with all four standard ABO blood types (A, B, AB, O) among phenotypically normal children requires that, among children who inherit at least one $H$ allele (i.e., $HH$ or $Hh$), the I-locus segregation produce all four genotypes $I^{A}I^{B}$ (AB), $I^{A}i$ (A), $I^{B}i$ (B), and $ii$ (O). The unique minimal parental I-locus combination that can yield all four is $I^{A}i \\times I^{B}i$, because:\n- $I^{A}i \\times I^{B}i$ produces the four zygotic I genotypes $\\{I^{A}I^{B}, I^{A}i, I^{B}i, ii\\}$, each with nonzero probability.\n- In children who are $HH$ or $Hh$, these express as AB, A, B, and O, respectively.\n- Additionally, with both parents $Hh$, $\\frac{1}{4}$ of all children are $hh$ and will be Bombay, matching the observation of at least one Bombay child.\n\nNow check each option against these requirements:\n\nA. $I^{A} i\\, Hh$ and $I^{B} i\\, Hh$: At the I locus, crosses yield $I^{A}I^{B}$, $I^{A}i$, $I^{B}i$, and $ii$, so among $HH$ or $Hh$ offspring all four standard ABO phenotypes occur.

By relating the physical distance between mutation sites to the frequency of recombination, this problem provides a powerful illustration of gene mapping and the molecular basis of allele formation.", "problem": "In the model diploid fungus *Neurospora crassa*, a single pleiotropic gene, designated `pan-2`, is critical for two distinct cellular functions. Its primary function is to encode an enzyme necessary for the biosynthesis of the vitamin pantothenic acid.

The secondary function of the `pan-2` protein is structural; it is required for the proper formation of ascospores, the sexual spores of the fungus.\n\nA geneticist has isolated two different recessive, inactivating point mutations within this gene, $pan\\text{-}2^{A}$ and $pan\\text{-}2^{B}$.\n- The $pan\\text{-}2^{A}$ allele produces a protein that is catalytically inactive but structurally sound. Thus, a strain homozygous for this allele ($pan\\text{-}2^{A}/pan\\text{-}2^{A}$) is auxotrophic for pantothenic acid but produces normal ascospores.\n- The $pan\\text{-}2^{B}$ allele produces a protein that is catalytically active but structurally defective. A strain homozygous for this allele ($pan\\text{-}2^{B}/pan\\text{-}2^{B}$) is prototrophic (grows on minimal medium) but fails to produce viable ascospores.\n\nThe geneticist performs a cross between a homozygous $pan\\text{-}2^{A}/pan\\text{-}2^{A}$ strain and a homozygous $pan\\text{-}2^{B}/pan\\text{-}2^{B}$ strain. The resulting F1 progeny are all phenotypically wild-type (prototrophic and forming normal ascospores) due to interallelic complementation. These F1 heterozygotes ($pan\\text{-}2^{A}/pan\\text{-}2^{B}$) are then test-crossed with a strain homozygous for a null allele, $pan\\text{-}2^{null}$, which is a complete deletion of the gene and is therefore auxotrophic and produces no ascospores.\n\nFine-structure genetic mapping reveals that the distance between the mutation sites `A` and `B` within the `pan-2` gene is 0.58 map units.
