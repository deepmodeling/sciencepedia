The production of this pigment is controlled by three independently assorting autosomal genes: Gene $A$, Gene $B$, and Gene $C$.\n\nThe pathway is structured as follows:\n1.  A dominant allele 'A' codes for Enzyme A, which converts a colorless precursor molecule P1 into a colorless intermediate P2. The recessive allele 'a' produces a non-functional enzyme.\n2.  A dominant allele 'B' codes for Enzyme B, which converts the intermediate P2 into the final blue pigment. The recessive allele 'b' produces a non-functional enzyme.\n3.

An individual will be pigmented (blue) only if it can successfully complete the entire biochemical pathway. This requires:\n1.  At least one dominant 'A' allele to produce functional Enzyme A (genotype $A\\_$).\n2.  At least one dominant 'B' allele to produce functional Enzyme B (genotype $B\\_$).\n3.  Two recessive 'c' alleles to ensure Enzyme B is not inhibited (genotype $cc$).\n\nTherefore, the only genotype that results in a blue-pigmented phenotype is $A\\_ B\\_ cc$.
