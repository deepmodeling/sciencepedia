This exercise presents a clinical scenario where an error in this process leads to monosomy 21, a form of aneuploidy. By analyzing the chromosome content of the polar bodies—the small byproducts of oogenesis—you can work backward to pinpoint when and how the meiotic error occurred, distinguishing between nondisjunction in meiosis I and meiosis II. This practice sharpens your mechanical understanding of oogenesis and the origins of aneuploid conditions [@problem_id:2299658].", "problem": "In human females, oogenesis begins before birth but arrests in prophase I. Following puberty, a primary oocyte completes meiosis I to produce a large secondary oocyte and a small first polar body (PB1). The secondary oocyte then arrests in metaphase II and is ovulated. If fertilization occurs, it completes meiosis II, yielding a fertilized ovum and a second polar body (PB2).\n\nConsider a case where preimplantation genetic diagnosis reveals that a zygote has monosomy 21, meaning it possesses only one copy of chromosome 21. This condition is known to have resulted from an error during the oogenesis that produced the ovum; the fertilizing sperm was genetically normal, carrying one copy of every chromosome, including chromosome 21.\n\nWhich of the following scenarios, describing the number of copies of chromosome 21 found in the polar bodies from that specific oogenesis event, could correctly account for the formation of the monosomic zygote? Note that there may be more than one correct option.\n\nA. PB1 contains one copy of chromosome 21; PB2 contains one copy of chromosome 21.\n\nB. PB1 contains two copies of chromosome 21; PB2 contains zero copies of chromosome 21.\n\nC. PB1 contains one copy of chromosome 21; PB2 contains two copies of chromosome 21.\n\nD. PB1 contains zero copies of chromosome 21; PB2 contains one copy of chromosome 21.\n\nE. PB1 contains zero copies of chromosome 21; PB2 contains zero copies of chromosome 21.", "solution": "We are told the sperm is normal (one copy of each chromosome, including chromosome 21), but the zygote is monosomic for chromosome 21. Therefore, the ovum must have contributed zero copies of chromosome 21. The oocyte must thus have ended meiosis II with no chromosome 21.\n\nKey meiotic principles:\n- Meiosis I (MI) separates homologous chromosomes; an MI nondisjunction sends both homologs to the same daughter cell and leaves the other daughter with none.\n- Meiosis II (MII) separates sister chromatids; an MII nondisjunction sends both sister chromatids of a homolog to the same daughter cell and leaves the other with none.\n- PB1 is the product of MI; PB2 is the product of the MII division of the secondary oocyte.\n\nWe need polar body patterns that are consistent with an ovum having zero chromosome 21.\n\nScenario 1 (MI nondisjunction causing a nullisomic secondary oocyte):\n- In MI, both homologs of chromosome 21 go to PB1, leaving the secondary oocyte with none.\n- Consequently, PB1 contains two copies of chromosome 21, the secondary oocyte contains zero.\n- In MII, because the secondary oocyte has no chromosome 21, PB2 receives zero and the ovum also receives zero.\n- Fertilization by a normal sperm then yields a monosomic zygote.\n- This matches option B: PB1 two copies; PB2 zero copies.\n\nScenario 2 (MI normal, MII nondisjunction in the secondary oocyte leading to loss from the ovum):\n- In MI, homologs segregate normally: PB1 receives one homolog (one copy), the secondary oocyte receives the other homolog (one copy).\n- In MII, nondisjunction of the sister chromatids in the secondary oocyte sends both sister chromatids of chromosome 21 into PB2, leaving the ovum with zero.\n- Thus PB1 contains one copy; PB2 contains two copies; the ovum contains zero.\n- Fertilization by a normal sperm yields a monosomic zygote.\n- This matches option C: PB1 one copy; PB2 two copies.\n\nExclusions:\n- A (PB1 one; PB2 one) corresponds to entirely normal segregation; the ovum would have one copy, producing a disomic (normal) zygote.\n- D (PB1 zero; PB2 one) arises from MI nondisjunction sending both homologs to the oocyte, followed by normal MII that gives one copy to PB2 and one to the ovum; the ovum would have one copy, yielding a disomic zygote.\n- E (PB1 zero; PB2 zero) would require both homologs to the oocyte in MI and then MII sending both sister chromatids to the ovum (PB2 zero), which gives the ovum two copies and leads to a trisomic zygote, not monosomy.\n\nTherefore, the correct scenarios are B and C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BC}$$", "id": "2299658"}, {"introduction": "While individuals carrying a balanced reciprocal translocation are often phenotypically normal, they can produce unbalanced gametes, leading to genetic disorders in their offspring. This problem challenges you to trace the consequences of a specific segregation error, known as adjacent-1 segregation, in a father who is a translocation carrier.

The father is phenotypically normal but is a carrier of a balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosome 4 and chromosome 11.

The resulting derivative chromosomes are `der(4)` and `der(11)`.\n\nTwo genes of interest are involved:\n- Gene *G4*, located at chromosomal position `4q31`, which is distal to the breakpoint on chromosome 4.\n- Gene *G11*, located at chromosomal position `11q25`, which is distal to the breakpoint on chromosome 11.\n\nThe father and a phenotypically and chromosomally normal mother have a child. This child inherits an unbalanced set of chromosomes due to an adjacent-1 segregation event during meiosis in the father. Specifically, the sperm cell that fertilized the ovum contained a normal chromosome 4 and the derivative chromosome `der(11)`. The mother contributed a normal gamete containing one chromosome 4 and one chromosome 11.\n\nAssuming that the cellular abundance of a protein is directly proportional to the copy number of its corresponding gene, calculate the expected abundance of the proteins encoded by *G4* and *G11* in the affected child, relative to the abundance in a chromosomally normal individual.\n\nPresent your final answer as a $1 \\times 2$ row matrix, where the first element is the relative abundance of the protein encoded by *G4* and the second element is the relative abundance of the protein encoded by *G11*.", "solution": "A balanced reciprocal translocation $t(4;11)(q21;q23)$ exchanges the distal segments beyond the breakpoints.

This branching pattern is represented as `((Human, Chimpanzee), Gorilla)`.\n\nTwo types of rearrangement events are considered to be the primary drivers of these differences:\n1.  **Inversion:** The order of a contiguous block of one or more gene clusters on a single chromosome is reversed. For example, a chromosome segment `A-B-C` becomes `C-B-A`.\n2.  **Translocation:** A terminal segment of one chromosome, containing one or more gene clusters, breaks off and attaches to the end of a non-homologous chromosome.

Moving Y between chromosomes cannot be achieved by inversion; it requires at least one translocation. Hence, at least one translocation is needed on the branch leading to the human-chimpanzee clade (or elsewhere off the gorilla lineage) to move Y from Chr1 to Chr2.\n- Therefore, the absolute minimum number of events is at least two: one translocation to move Y to Chr2 in the human-chimp lineage and one inversion to explain the Y-Z versus Z-Y difference between human and chimpanzee.\n\nConstructing an explicit scenario that achieves this bound:\n- Take the ancestral (root) state to match the gorilla arrangement by parsimony: Chr1: X-Y | Chr2: Z.\n- On the internal branch leading to the human-chimpanzee ancestor, perform a single translocation moving the terminal segment Y from the end of Chr1 to the end of Chr2. This yields Chr1: X | Chr2: Z-Y.\n- This state matches the chimpanzee arrangement exactly, so the chimpanzee lineage requires zero additional events.\n- On the human lineage, perform a single inversion of the contiguous block Y-Z on Chr2 (equivalently, invert Z-Y) to obtain Chr2: Y-Z. This produces the human arrangement.\n\nEvent count:\n- Gorilla lineage: zero events.\n- Human-chimpanzee internal lineage: one translocation (move Y from Chr1 to the end of Chr2, yielding Z-Y).\n- Human lineage: one inversion (Z-Y to Y-Z).\n- Chimpanzee lineage: zero events.\n\nThis achieves the lower bound of two total events and matches option A.
