Two specific traits are of interest: flower color and plant height. The gene for flower color has two alleles: a dominant allele $A$ for purple flowers and a recessive allele $a$ for white flowers. The gene for plant height also has two alleles: a dominant allele $B$ for tall plants and a recessive allele $b$ for dwarf plants. These two genes are located on different chromosomes and therefore assort independently according to Mendelian genetics.\n\nThe scientist performs a cross between two parent plants. Parent 1 has the genotype $AaBb$. Parent 2 has the genotype $Aabb$.\n\nCalculate the probability of obtaining an offspring from this cross that has purple flowers and is of dwarf height. Express your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability of an offspring with a specific combination of phenotypes: purple flowers and dwarf height. The overall parental cross is between an individual with genotype $AaBb$ and an individual with genotype $Aabb$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the genotypes that correspond to the desired phenotypes.\n- For flower color, purple is the dominant trait. Therefore, an offspring with purple flowers can have a genotype of either $AA$ or $Aa$.\n- For plant height, dwarf is the recessive trait. Therefore, an offspring that is dwarf must have the genotype $bb$.\n\nThe problem states that the two genes assort independently. This means we can consider the inheritance of each gene separately and then combine the probabilities using the product rule.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the cross for the flower color gene ($A$). The parental genotypes for this gene are $Aa \\times Aa$.\nThe possible gametes from each parent are $A$ and $a$, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nWe can use a Punnett square to find the probabilities of the offspring genotypes:\n\n| | $A$ | $a$ |\n| :---: | :-: | :-: |\n| **$A$** | $AA$| $Aa$|\n| **$a$** | $Aa$| $aa$|\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the probabilities of the offspring genotypes are:\n- P($AA$) = $\\frac{1}{4}$\n- P($Aa$) = $\\frac{1}{2}$\n- P($aa$) = $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe probability of an offspring having purple flowers is the probability of it having either the $AA$ or $Aa$ genotype.\nP(purple flowers) = P($AA$) + P($Aa$) = $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the cross for the plant height gene ($B$). The parental genotypes for this gene are $Bb \\times bb$.\nThe parent with genotype $Bb$ produces two types of gametes, $B$ and $b$, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe parent with genotype $bb$ produces only one type of gamete, $b$, with a probability of 1.\nThe Punnett square for this cross is:\n\n| | $b$ |\n| :---: | :-: |\n| **$B$** | $Bb$|\n| **$b$** | $bb$|\n\nFrom this, the probabilities of the offspring genotypes are:\n- P($Bb$) = $\\frac{1}{2}$\n- P($bb$) = $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThe problem asks for an offspring of dwarf height, which corresponds to the genotype $bb$.\nP(dwarf height) = P($bb$) = $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFinally, to find the probability of an offspring having both purple flowers and dwarf height, we use the product rule for independent events:\nP(purple and dwarf) = P(purple flowers) $\\times$ P(dwarf height)\nP(purple and dwarf) = $\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\n\nThus, the probability of obtaining an offspring with purple flowers and dwarf height from this cross is $\\frac{3}{8}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$$", "id": "2304194"}, {"introduction": "While standard Mendelian ratios provide a powerful predictive framework, real-world genetics is often more complex. This problem [@problem_id:2304182] introduces the concept of a lethal allele, where a specific genotype is non-viable and thus excluded from the population of observed offspring. By working through this scenario, you'll learn how such alleles modify the expected phenotypic ratios, offering a more nuanced and realistic view of inheritance.", "problem": "In a particular breed of domestic chicken, two independently assorting genes control feather morphology and color.\n\nFor the first gene, controlling feather morphology, the allele for frizzled feathers ($F$) is dominant over the allele for normal, straight feathers ($f$). However, this gene exhibits pleiotropy where the homozygous dominant genotype ($FF$) is embryonic lethal, meaning these chicks fail to hatch.\n\nFor the second gene, controlling feather color, the allele for black feathers ($B$) is completely dominant over the allele for splash-white feathers ($b$).\n\nA poultry farmer performs a cross between a male chicken that is frizzled and heterozygous for black feathers and a female chicken that is also frizzled and heterozygous for black feathers.\n\nAssuming Mendelian inheritance for both genes, which of the following represents the expected phenotypic ratio among the viable (hatched) offspring? The ratio is presented in the order: (Frizzled-Black : Frizzled-White : Normal-Black : Normal-White).\n\nA. 9:3:3:1\n\nB. 6:2:3:1\n\nC. 3:1:3:1\n\nD. 2:1\n\nE. 4:2:2:1", "solution": "The first step is to determine the genotypes of the parent chickens based on their described phenotypes.\nBoth parents are described as \"frizzled\". The frizzled phenotype is caused by the dominant allele $F$. A chicken can have a genotype of $Ff$ or $FF$ to express this trait. However, the problem states that the $FF$ genotype is embryonic lethal. Therefore, any living frizzled chicken must have the heterozygous genotype $Ff$.\nBoth parents are also described as \"heterozygous for black feathers\". The gene for feather color has alleles $B$ (black) and $b$ (splash-white). A heterozygous individual has the genotype $Bb$.\nThus, the genotype of both the male and female parent is $Ff Bb$.\n\nThe cross being performed is $Ff Bb \\times Ff Bb$.\nSince the two genes assort independently, we can analyze the inheritance of each trait separately and then combine the probabilities of the outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cross for feather morphology: $Ff \\times Ff$.\nThe expected genotypic ratio from this cross, according to Mendelian principles, would be 1 $FF$ : 2 $Ff$ : 1 $ff$.\nHowever, the $FF$ genotype is lethal, so these individuals do not survive to hatch. We must therefore adjust the ratios to consider only the viable offspring. The viable genotypes are $Ff$ and $ff$.\nThe ratio of viable genotypes is 2 $Ff$ : 1 $ff$.\nNow, we determine the phenotypes corresponding to these viable genotypes:\n- $Ff$ genotype results in a \"Frizzled\" phenotype.\n- $ff$ genotype results in a \"Normal\" phenotype.\nSo, among the viable offspring, the phenotypic ratio for feather morphology is 2 Frizzled : 1 Normal. This can be expressed in terms of probabilities: the probability of a viable chick being frizzled is $P(\\text{Frizzled}) = \\frac{2}{3}$, and the probability of it being normal is $P(\\text{Normal}) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nNext, let's consider the cross for feather color: $Bb \\times Bb$.\nThis is a standard monohybrid cross. The expected genotypic ratio is 1 $BB$ : 2 $Bb$ : 1 $bb$.\nThe phenotypes corresponding to these genotypes are:\n- $BB$ and $Bb$ genotypes result in a \"Black\" phenotype (due to complete dominance).\n- $bb$ genotype results in a \"Splash-white\" phenotype.\nCounting the phenotypes, we get a ratio of 3 Black : 1 Splash-white.\nIn terms of probabilities: the probability of a chick being black is $P(\\text{Black}) = \\frac{3}{4}$, and the probability of it being splash-white is $P(\\text{Splash-white}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nFinally, to find the expected phenotypic ratio for the dihybrid cross among viable offspring, we multiply the probabilities of the independent events:\n- Probability of Frizzled and Black: $P(\\text{Frizzled}) \\times P(\\text{Black}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{6}{12}$\n- Probability of Frizzled and Splash-white: $P(\\text{Frizzled}) \\times P(\\text{Splash-white}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{12}$\n- Probability of Normal and Black: $P(\\text{Normal}) \\times P(\\text{Black}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{12}$\n- Probability of Normal and Splash-white: $P(\\text{Normal}) \\times P(\\text{Splash-white}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{12}$\n\nThese probabilities give us the phenotypic ratio. To express it in the simplest whole numbers, we can use the numerators since the denominator (12) is common to all.\nThe resulting ratio is (Frizzled-Black : Frizzled-White : Normal-Black : Normal-White) = 6:2:3:1.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2304182"}, {"introduction": "Gene expression is not always a simple, independent process; sometimes, genes interact in fascinating ways.

The first locus, the Agouti locus, influences the pattern of pigment on each hair. The dominant allele, $A$, produces an \"agouti\" pattern with alternating bands of dark and light pigment, while the recessive allele, $a$, results in a solid \"black\" coat. The second locus, the Color locus, controls the synthesis of pigment.
