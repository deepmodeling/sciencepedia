Offspring with a normal chromosome number (disomic) and the dominant phenotype ($Ii$) can be produced from a meiosis I nondisjunction event.\n\nE. Trisomic offspring with the recessive (matte) phenotype can only be produced if the nondisjunction event occurs in meiosis I.", "solution": "Let the male be heterozygous $Ii$ and the female be homozygous recessive $ii$. The locus is on an autosome. The female produces only haploid eggs carrying $i$. The male experiences exactly one nondisjunction event affecting the chromosome carrying this gene.\n\nPrinciples:\n- In meiosis I nondisjunction (MI NDJ), the homologous chromosomes carrying $I$ and $i$ fail to separate. This results in one secondary spermatocyte receiving both homologs, while the other receives none. The cell with both homologs divides in meiosis II, producing two $n+1$ gametes (each containing a chromosome with allele $I$ and a chromosome with allele $i$). The nullisomic cell divides to produce two $n-1$ gametes. Therefore, all four sperm produced are aneuploid, and there are no chromosomally normal sperm.\n- In meiosis II nondisjunction (MII NDJ), meiosis I is normal: one secondary spermatocyte carries the $I$ homolog and the other carries the $i$ homolog. If nondisjunction occurs in one of these secondary spermatocytes, its sister chromatids fail to separate, yielding one $n+1$ gamete and one $n-1$ gamete. The other secondary spermatocyte divides normally to produce two chromosomally normal ($n$) gametes. Thus, the four sperm produced are: two normal haploid (50% of total), one $n+1$ (25%), and one $n-1$ (25%).\n\nEnumerate zygotes after fertilization with $i$ eggs:\n- MI NDJ male sperm:\n  - The $n+1$ sperm have genotype $Ii$. Fertilization with an $i$ egg yields a trisomic $Iii$ zygote; phenotype is dominant (iridescent).\n  - The $n-1$ sperm have no allele. Fertilization with an $i$ egg yields a monosomic $i$ zygote; phenotype is recessive (matte).\n  - There are no disomic (chromosomally normal) offspring. All offspring are aneuploid.\n- MII NDJ male sperm:\n  - The two normal haploid sperm yield disomic offspring upon fertilization. If the normal sperm is $I$, the zygote is $Ii$ (dominant phenotype). If the normal sperm is $i$, the zygote is $ii$ (recessive phenotype).\n  - The aneuploid gametes depend on which secondary spermatocyte had the MII error. If it was the $I$-carrying cell, the $n+1$ sperm is $II$, yielding a trisomic $IIi$ zygote (dominant). If it was the $i$-carrying cell, the $n+1$ sperm is $ii$, yielding a trisomic $iii$ zygote (recessive).\n  - Therefore, MII NDJ produces a mixture including 50% chromosomally normal (disomic) offspring and 50% aneuploid offspring.\n\nKey difference:\n- MI NDJ produces 100% aneuploid offspring and 0% disomic offspring.\n- MII NDJ produces 50% disomic (chromosomally normal) offspring and 50% aneuploid offspring.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: it reverses the outcomes for meiosis I and II.\n- B is correct: MI NDJ results in 100% aneuploid offspring, whereas MII NDJ can yield 50% chromosomally normal offspring.\n- C is incorrect: the sets of potential offspring genotypes differ (e.g., trisomic $iii$ and normal disomic offspring occur only with MII NDJ).\n- D is incorrect: MI NDJ cannot produce chromosomally normal offspring.\n- E is incorrect: trisomic recessive ($iii$) can arise only from MII NDJ in this cross, not MI NDJ.\n\nThus, the accurate statement is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2318070"}, {"introduction": "The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance is a powerful predictive framework, not just a set of rules for familiar $XY$ systems.

In this system, males are the homogametic sex with two Z chromosomes (ZZ), and females are the heterogametic sex with one Z and one W chromosome (ZW).\n\nConsider a hypothetical gene that controls feather iridescence in a species of bird. The allele for standard, matte feathers ($A$) is dominant to a recessive allele for enhanced, glossy iridescence ($a$). This gene is located on the Z chromosome, and there is no corresponding locus on the W chromosome.\n\nAssuming the recessive allele $a$ is present but rare within the general population's gene pool, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the observable pattern of the glossy iridescence trait?\n\nA. Males are more likely to have glossy feathers because they have two Z chromosomes, doubling their chance of carrying the allele.\n\nB. Females are more likely to have glossy feathers because they only need one copy of the recessive allele to express the trait.\n\nC. Males and females are equally likely to have glossy feathers.\n\nD. Only males can have glossy feathers, as females lack a second Z chromosome.\n\nE. It is impossible to predict without knowing the exact frequency of the recessive allele in the population.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which sex is more likely to express a Z-linked recessive trait in a ZW sex-determination system.\n\nFirst, let's establish the genetic requirements for each sex to express the recessive phenotype (glossy feathers, from allele $a$). The problem states that the allele for standard feathers ($A$) is dominant to the allele for glossy feathers ($a$), and the gene is on the Z chromosome.\n\nThe sex chromosomes for males are ZZ, and for females are ZW.\n\nFor a male (ZZ) to have glossy feathers, he must be homozygous recessive. His genotype must be $Z^aZ^a$. To achieve this genotype, he must inherit a $Z^a$ chromosome from his mother (who must have the genotype $Z^aW$) and a $Z^a$ chromosome from his father (who must carry the $Z^a$ allele, e.g., genotype $Z^AZ^a$ or $Z^aZ^a$). In short, a male needs to inherit **two** copies of the recessive allele $a$ to express the trait.\n\nFor a female (ZW) to have glossy feathers, her genotype must be $Z^aW$. Since the W chromosome does not carry the allele for this trait, the presence of a single recessive allele $a$ on her Z chromosome is sufficient for the trait to be expressed. This condition, where an individual has only one copy of a gene, is called hemizygosity. A female needs to inherit only **one** copy of the recessive allele $a$ (from her father) to express the trait.\n\nNow, we must consider the fact that the recessive allele $a$ is rare in the population. Let the frequency of the $a$ allele in the gene pool be $p$, where $p$ is a small number (i.e., $p \\ll 1$).\n\nThe probability of a male being born with the $Z^aZ^a$ genotype is related to the probability of inheriting two $Z^a$ alleles. In population genetics terms, assuming random mating (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), the frequency of $Z^aZ^a$ individuals would be approximately $p^2$.\n\nThe probability of a female being born with the $Z^aW$ genotype is related to the probability of inheriting one $Z^a$ allele. The frequency of $Z^aW$ individuals would be approximately $p$.\n\nSince $p$ is the frequency of a rare allele, it is a small positive number less than 1 (e.g., $p = 0.01$). The value of $p^2$ (e.g., $0.01^2 = 0.0001$) will be significantly smaller than $p$.\n\nTherefore, the frequency of females expressing the trait (proportional to $p$) will be much higher than the frequency of males expressing the trait (proportional to $p^2$). Females are more likely to have glossy feathers because they are hemizygous for Z-linked genes and only require a single copy of the recessive allele to display the phenotype. This is the inverse of the pattern seen for X-linked recessive traits in humans (an XY system), where males are more frequently affected.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. Incorrect. While males have two Z chromosomes, this makes it *harder* for them to express a recessive trait, as they need two copies of the allele, not just one.\nB. Correct. Females are hemizygous ($Z^aW$). They only need one copy of the recessive allele to express the phenotype, which is a more probable event than a male inheriting two copies.\nC. Incorrect. The probability depends on requiring one vs. two alleles, which are not equally probable events for a rare allele.\nD. Incorrect. Males can have glossy feathers if they have the genotype $Z^aZ^a$.\nE. Incorrect. While the exact frequency value is unknown, knowing that the allele is \"rare\" is sufficient to conclude that $p$ is small and thus $p^2 \\ll p$.
