Understanding this concept is key to grasping phenomena like surface tension and capillary action, which are vital for life.", "problem": "A small droplet of water is placed on two different flat surfaces under the same atmospheric conditions. On surface A, a waxy leaf cuticle, the water droplet beads up, forming a shape that is nearly spherical. On surface B, an immaculately clean, untreated glass slide, the same volume of water spreads out, forming a thin, flat film. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for this observation based on the properties of water?\n\nA. On the waxy leaf, adhesive forces between water and wax are stronger than cohesive forces between water molecules. On the glass slide, cohesive forces are stronger than adhesive forces.\n\nB. The waxy leaf is hydrophilic, causing strong adhesion that pulls the water into a bead. The glass slide is hydrophobic, allowing the water to spread out due to weak cohesive forces.\n\nC. On the waxy leaf, cohesive forces among water molecules are significantly stronger than the adhesive forces between water and the nonpolar wax surface. On the glass slide, the adhesive forces between water and the polar glass surface are stronger than the cohesive forces within the water.\n\nD. Gravity has a greater effect on the water droplet on the glass slide than on the waxy leaf, causing it to flatten. The spherical shape on the leaf is due to a reduction in the water's surface tension on wax.\n\nE. On both surfaces, cohesive forces are the only significant factor. The difference in shape is due to the different thermal conductivities of the wax and glass, which alters the water's interaction with the surface.", "solution": "We compare the shapes of a water droplet on two solids under identical atmospheric conditions. The droplet’s shape is governed by the balance of cohesive forces within the liquid and adhesive forces between the liquid and the solid, expressible via interfacial tensions. The equilibrium contact angle $\\theta$ satisfies Young’s equation:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv}-\\gamma_{sl}=\\gamma_{lv}\\cos\\theta,\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{sv}$ is the solid–vapor interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{sl}$ is the solid–liquid interfacial tension, and $\\gamma_{lv}$ is the liquid–vapor surface tension (constant for the same liquid and ambient conditions). Additionally, complete spreading (formation of a thin film) is characterized by the spreading parameter\n$$\nS=\\gamma_{sv}-(\\gamma_{sl}+\\gamma_{lv}),\n$$\nwith $S\\geq 0$ indicating complete wetting ($\\theta\\to 0$) and $S<0$ indicating partial wetting ($\\theta>0$).\n\nOn the waxy leaf (nonpolar, hydrophobic surface), the droplet beads up and is nearly spherical, implying a large contact angle $\\theta$ with $\\cos\\theta\\leq 0$. From Young’s equation, $\\gamma_{sv}-\\gamma_{sl}\\leq 0$, so $\\gamma_{sl}\\geq\\gamma_{sv}$, which indicates a high solid–liquid interfacial energy and thus weak adhesion between water and wax. To minimize the high-energy solid–liquid interface, the droplet minimizes its contact area, a manifestation that cohesive forces within water (due to hydrogen bonding among water molecules) dominate over adhesive interactions with the nonpolar wax. This is consistent with $S<0$ (no spreading).\n\nOn the clean glass slide (polar, hydrophilic surface), the same volume of water spreads into a thin, flat film, indicating complete wetting, i.e., $\\theta\\to 0$ and $S\\geq 0$. From Young’s equation in the limit $\\theta\\to 0$, $\\gamma_{sv}-\\gamma_{sl}\\approx\\gamma_{lv}$, which requires $\\gamma_{sl}$ to be sufficiently small relative to $\\gamma_{sv}$ and $\\gamma_{lv}$. A small $\\gamma_{sl}$ reflects strong adhesive interactions between water and the polar glass surface (e.g., hydrogen bonding to surface hydroxyl groups). Thus, adhesive forces exceed cohesive forces at the contact line and draw the water across the surface.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because it reverses the relative strengths on both surfaces.\n- B is incorrect because it mislabels the waxy leaf as hydrophilic and the glass as hydrophobic, and misattributes spreading to weak cohesion.\n- C correctly states that on wax, cohesive forces among water molecules exceed adhesive forces to the nonpolar surface (beading), while on glass, adhesive forces to the polar surface exceed cohesion (spreading).\n- D is incorrect because gravity acts equally in both cases and water’s surface tension $\\gamma_{lv}$ is not reduced specifically on wax; the difference arises from adhesion versus cohesion.\n- E is incorrect because thermal conductivity is not the governing factor; interfacial tensions and the resulting adhesion–cohesion balance dictate wetting behavior.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2294143"}, {"introduction": "As the universal solvent of life, water's interaction with dissolved substances has profound consequences at the cellular level, a principle powerfully demonstrated by osmosis. This exercise [@problem_id:2347055] challenges you to explain what happens to a red blood cell when placed in pure water, a classic example of osmotic stress. By working through this scenario, you will connect the molecular properties of water to the crucial role of water potential in maintaining cellular integrity.", "problem": "A cell biology student is investigating the principles of osmosis using mammalian Red Blood Cells (RBCs). The cytoplasm of these cells contains a complex mixture of proteins, salts, and other molecules, resulting in an internal solute concentration that is isotonic to a 0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution. The student carefully transfers a sample of these RBCs into a beaker containing a large volume of pure, deionized water. Within minutes, the student observes through a microscope that the RBCs swell and then rupture, a phenomenon known as hemolysis.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most complete and accurate molecular explanation for this observation, correctly linking the properties of the water molecule, the cell membrane, and the internal cellular environment?\n\nA. As a universal solvent, water begins to dissolve the nonpolar lipid components of the RBC membrane, causing the membrane to lose its integrity and the cell to fall apart.\n\nB. The high specific heat of water allows it to absorb significant energy from the RBCs, causing the internal cytoplasm to cool and contract, which pulls the membrane apart.\n\nC. The RBCs' active transport systems, which normally maintain ion balance, malfunction in the pure water environment and begin to actively pump water molecules into the cell, causing it to overfill and burst.\n\nD. Because water is a polar molecule, it can move across the semipermeable cell membrane, but the dissolved polar and charged solutes within the cell cannot easily pass out. This creates a water potential gradient that drives the net diffusion of water into the hypertonic cytoplasm, leading to an increase in hydrostatic pressure that ruptures the cell.\n\nE. The deionized water, lacking any ions, has a strong chemical affinity for the salts inside the RBC. This creates a powerful attractive force that pulls the cell membrane outwards until it tears.", "solution": "The problem asks for the best explanation for why Red Blood Cells (RBCs) undergo hemolysis (rupture) when placed in pure, deionized water. This requires an understanding of osmosis, the properties of water, and the structure of the cell membrane.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the initial conditions.\nThe RBC has a higher concentration of solutes (salts, proteins, etc.) inside its cytoplasm compared to the surrounding pure deionized water. In osmotic terms, the cell's internal environment is **hypertonic** (higher solute concentration) relative to the external environment, which is **hypotonic** (lower solute concentration).\n\nStep 2: Consider the properties of the key components.\n- **Water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$)**: Water is a **polar molecule**. The oxygen atom has a partial negative charge ($\\delta^-$), and the hydrogen atoms have partial positive charges ($\\delta^+$). This polarity makes water an excellent solvent for other polar or charged substances (like the salts and many proteins inside the RBC), but a poor solvent for nonpolar substances.\n- **Cell Membrane**: The RBC membrane is a phospholipid bilayer. The \"heads\" of the phospholipids are polar/hydrophilic, while the \"tails\" are nonpolar/hydrophobic. This structure makes the membrane an effective barrier to the passage of large, polar, or charged solutes. However, small, polar molecules like water can pass through it, either by diffusing directly across the bilayer to a limited extent or more rapidly through specialized protein channels called aquaporins. The membrane is therefore **semipermeable**: it allows the solvent (water) to pass through but restricts the movement of most solutes.\n\nStep 3: Apply the principle of osmosis.\nOsmosis is the net movement of solvent molecules (in this case, water) across a semipermeable membrane from a region of higher solvent concentration (and lower solute concentration) to a region of lower solvent concentration (and higher solute concentration). This movement occurs down the water potential gradient. The pure water outside the cell has a higher water potential (higher concentration of free water molecules) than the cytoplasm inside the cell, where many water molecules are associated with solute particles.\n\nStep 4: Predict the movement of water.\nDue to the water potential gradient described in Step 3, there will be a net movement of water from the outside (hypotonic solution) into the RBC's cytoplasm (hypertonic solution).\n\nStep 5: Determine the consequence for the cell.\nAs water continuously enters the RBC, its volume increases, and it begins to swell. Animal cells, unlike plant cells, do not have a rigid cell wall to withstand this increase in internal hydrostatic pressure (turgor pressure). The plasma membrane is stretched beyond its elastic limit and eventually ruptures, releasing the cell's contents. This is hemolysis.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options based on this understanding.\n- **A**: This is incorrect. Water is a poor solvent for the nonpolar lipid tails that form the core of the membrane. The membrane does not dissolve in water.\n- **B**: This is incorrect. The specific heat of water relates to its ability to resist temperature changes, which is not the primary mechanism causing the cell to rupture in this isothermal scenario.\n- **C**: This is incorrect. Water movement via osmosis is a passive process (diffusion) and does not require active transport or ATP. Active transport pumps move solutes, not water, against their concentration gradients.\n- **D**: This statement accurately describes the entire process. It correctly identifies water as polar, the membrane as semipermeable, the solutes as being trapped inside, the resulting water potential gradient, the net movement of water into the hypertonic cell (osmosis), and the subsequent rupture due to increased hydrostatic pressure. This is the most complete and accurate explanation.\n- **E**: This is incorrect. While there is a concentration gradient, it does not manifest as a direct physical \"pull\" on the membrane. The force is generated by the net influx of water molecules increasing the internal pressure. The language of a \"powerful attractive force pulling the cell membrane outwards\" is a physically inaccurate description of osmosis.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the best explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2347055"}, {"introduction": "Water's colligative properties, such as freezing point depression, depend on the concentration of dissolved solutes and are ingeniously exploited by some organisms for survival.
