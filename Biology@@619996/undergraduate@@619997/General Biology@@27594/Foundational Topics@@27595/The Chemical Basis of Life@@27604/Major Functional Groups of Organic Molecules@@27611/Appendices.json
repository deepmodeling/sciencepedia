This practice provides a quantitative answer by introducing the concept of the average oxidation state of carbon, a measure of how \"reduced\" a molecule is. By calculating this value for both glucose and a fatty acid, you can directly see how the different compositions of functional groups make one molecule a more reduced, and therefore more energy-rich, fuel source than the other [@problem_id:2301510]. This exercise bridges the gap between molecular structure and metabolic energy yield.", "problem": "The relative energy content of biological macromolecules is largely determined by the oxidation state of their constituent carbon atoms. A lower (more negative) average oxidation state corresponds to a more reduced state, which can yield more energy upon complete oxidation to carbon dioxide. This problem requires you to quantitatively compare the reduction level of a carbohydrate and a fatty acid.\n\nTo determine the average oxidation state of carbon in a molecule, you can use the following simplified set of rules:\n1.  The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule is zero.\n2.  The oxidation state of a hydrogen atom (H) is +1.\n3.  The oxidation state of an oxygen atom (O) is -2.\n\nConsider a molecule of glucose, a simple sugar with the chemical formula C$_{6}$H$_{12}$O$_{6}$, and a molecule of palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid with the chemical formula C$_{16}$H$_{32}$O$_{2}$.\n\nCalculate the average oxidation state of a carbon atom in glucose and the average oxidation state of a carbon atom in palmitic acid.

This practice explores a common example: the deamidation of an asparagine residue. You will analyze how converting a neutral amide side chain into a negatively charged carboxylate group can destabilize a protein's structure and trigger its aggregation, revealing the profound link between the chemical stability of functional groups and the long-term health of a cell [@problem_id:2301519].", "problem": "A hypothetical soluble human enzyme, 'Kinasine', is stable and active in the cytosol at physiological pH 7.4. Its tertiary structure is partly maintained by a surface-exposed alpha-helix containing a critical asparagine residue (Asn-88). Over time, Asn-88 undergoes spontaneous, non-enzymatic deamidation, a chemical reaction that converts its side chain into that of an aspartic acid residue. This single modification is sufficient to cause Kinasine molecules to partially unfold and form large, non-functional aggregates.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and comprehensive biophysical explanation for this aggregation process?\n\nA. The newly formed carboxylate group acts as a powerful nucleophile, catalyzing the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in neighboring protein molecules, leading to protein fragments that subsequently aggregate.\n\nB. The aspartic acid side chain is significantly larger than the asparagine side chain, creating a steric clash that physically forces the alpha-helix to unravel. The aggregation is then caused by the exposed peptide backbone.\n\nC. The new aspartic acid side chain, being negatively charged at pH 7.4, disrupts the local electrostatic environment and hydrogen bond network, leading to the destabilization and unfolding of the alpha-helix. This exposes previously buried hydrophobic residues, which then drive intermolecular aggregation.\n\nD. The deamidation reaction releases an ammonia molecule, which locally increases the pH and catalyzes the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between other cysteine residues, locking the proteins together.\n\nE. The conversion to aspartic acid removes a key hydrogen bond donor (the amide -NH2), but the new carboxyl group (−COOH) remains neutral at pH 7.4 and forms stronger internal hydrogen bonds, causing the protein to misfold into a rigid, aggregation-prone beta-sheet structure.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most accurate biophysical explanation for protein aggregation following the spontaneous deamidation of an asparagine residue. Let's analyze the chemical and physical changes involved and evaluate each option.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the chemical transformation.**\nThe process is the deamidation of asparagine (Asn) to form aspartic acid (Asp).\n- The side chain of asparagine is an amide: $-CH_2-CO-NH_2$.\n- The side chain of aspartic acid is a carboxylic acid: $-CH_2-COOH$.\nThe reaction is effectively a hydrolysis of the side-chain amide to a carboxylic acid, releasing ammonia ($NH_3$).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the properties of the side chains at physiological pH.**\nThe problem states the process occurs in the cytosol at a physiological pH of 7.4. We must consider the protonation state of each functional group at this pH.\n- The asparagine side chain is polar but uncharged at all physiological pH values. It can participate in hydrogen bonding as both a donor (from the $-NH_2$) and an acceptor (at the carbonyl oxygen).\n- The aspartic acid side chain has a carboxylic acid group with a p$K_a$ of approximately 3.9. Since the environmental pH (7.4) is much higher than the p$K_a$ (3.9), the carboxylic acid group will be predominantly deprotonated.\n$$ -COOH + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons -COO^{-} + H_3O^{+} $$\nThus, the aspartic acid side chain will exist as a negatively charged carboxylate ion ($-COO^{-}$).\n\nThe net effect of the deamidation is the replacement of a neutral, polar group (amide) with a negatively charged group (carboxylate) at the location of residue 88.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the impact on protein tertiary structure.**\nThe native structure of a protein is stabilized by a delicate balance of non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions (salt bridges), van der Waals forces, and the hydrophobic effect.\nThe introduction of a new, fixed negative charge at Asn-88's position will have a profound impact:\n- **Electrostatic Disruption:** If the region around Asn-88 contained other negatively charged residues (like glutamate or another aspartate), a new repulsive force is introduced. If it was near a positively charged residue (lysine or arginine), a previously non-existent salt bridge might form, or an existing interaction network could be altered. In any case, the original electrostatic potential surface is drastically changed.\n- **Hydrogen Bond Network Disruption:** The original asparagine amide group could participate in a specific hydrogen bond network. The -NH2 group, a hydrogen bond donor, is lost. The new carboxylate group is an excellent hydrogen bond acceptor, but it cannot donate hydrogen bonds. This change disrupts the specific bonding pattern that helped stabilize the alpha-helix.\n\nThese disruptions lead to the destabilization of the local structure, in this case, the surface-exposed alpha-helix, causing it to partially or fully unfold.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the mechanism of aggregation.**\nSoluble, globular proteins like Kinasine typically have a nonpolar, hydrophobic core and a polar, hydrophilic surface that favorably interacts with water. When a region of the protein, like the alpha-helix at the surface, unfolds, it can expose hydrophobic amino acid residues that were previously buried within the protein's core or at an interface.\n- **The Hydrophobic Effect:** These exposed hydrophobic \"patches\" are thermodynamically unfavorable in the aqueous cytosol. To minimize their contact with water molecules, hydrophobic patches on different unfolded protein molecules will associate with each other. This intermolecular association driven by the hydrophobic effect is a primary mechanism for the formation of insoluble protein aggregates.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the given options.**\n\n- **A:** This suggests peptide bond hydrolysis. While a carboxylate can be a nucleophile, it is a very weak one, and this is not a known or significant mechanism for aggregation initiated by deamidation. This option is incorrect.\n- **B:** This suggests steric hindrance is the primary cause. The change from $-CO-NH_2$ to $-CO-OH$ (or $-COO^{-}$) is a very small change in atomic composition and volume. The resulting steric effect would be negligible compared to the massive electrostatic change of introducing a full negative charge. This option is incorrect.\n- **C:** This option correctly identifies all the key steps. It states that the new negative charge at pH 7.4 disrupts local electrostatics and hydrogen bonds, leading to destabilization and unfolding. It then correctly identifies that the unfolding exposes hydrophobic residues, which in turn drive aggregation. This is the most accurate and comprehensive explanation.\n- **D:** This suggests aggregation via disulfide bonds. Deamidation has no direct chemical relationship with the formation of disulfide bonds, which involves the oxidation of cysteine residues. Also, the release of one ammonia molecule per protein would have a negligible effect on the overall buffered pH of the cytosol. This option is incorrect.\n- **E:** This option correctly identifies the loss of a hydrogen bond donor but makes a critical error by stating the carboxyl group remains neutral at pH 7.4. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the pKa of aspartic acid. As established, it will be negatively charged, not neutral. This option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct and most complete mechanistic description of the process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2301519"}]}
