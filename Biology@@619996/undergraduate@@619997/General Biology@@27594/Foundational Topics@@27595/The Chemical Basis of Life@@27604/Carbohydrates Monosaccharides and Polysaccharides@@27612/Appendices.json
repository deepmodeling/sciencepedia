This practice explores the crucial role of glycosidic bond stereochemistry in determining whether a polysaccharide is a food source or an indigestible fiber, highlighting the principle of enzyme specificity. [@problem_id:2283543]", "problem": "The human digestive system is highly efficient at extracting energy from polysaccharides like starch, which is a primary component of foods such as potatoes and rice. Starch is a polymer composed of glucose monosaccharide units. Interestingly, paper towels are also primarily composed of a polysaccharide, cellulose, which is also a polymer of glucose. Despite this similarity, humans are incapable of deriving any nutritional value from consuming paper towels.\n\nImagine a hypothetical scenario where a single type of enzymatic activity could be safely added to the human gastrointestinal tract to unlock the chemical energy stored in cellulose, making paper towels a digestible food source. Which of the following describes the essential activity this new enzyme must perform?\n\nA. Activity that hydrolyzes alpha-1,4-glycosidic linkages.\n\nB. Activity that hydrolyzes beta-1,4-glycosidic linkages.\n\nC. Activity that hydrolyzes alpha-1,6-glycosidic linkages.\n\nD. Activity that hydrolyzes peptide bonds.\n\nE. Activity that hydrolyzes ester linkages in triglycerides.", "solution": "We are asked what single enzymatic activity, if added to the human gastrointestinal tract, would allow humans to derive energy from cellulose in paper towels. The relevant biochemical facts and logical steps are:\n\n1) Starch is composed of glucose units joined primarily by alpha-1,4-glycosidic linkages, with branch points formed by alpha-1,6-glycosidic linkages. Humans possess enzymes such as salivary and pancreatic amylases that hydrolyze alpha-1,4-glycosidic linkages, and debranching enzymes that address alpha-1,6-glycosidic linkages, enabling efficient digestion of starch.\n\n2) Cellulose is also a polymer of glucose, but the glucose units are linked exclusively by beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds. The difference in the anomeric configuration of the glycosidic linkage (beta versus alpha) leads to a different three-dimensional structure (linear, hydrogen-bonded fibrils) and renders cellulose resistant to human digestive enzymes.\n\n3) Humans lack endogenous cellulases; specifically, we do not have enzymes that hydrolyze beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds between glucose units. In contrast, certain microbes produce cellulases that can cleave these bonds.\n\n4) Therefore, to unlock the energy in cellulose with a single added activity, the essential activity is hydrolysis of beta-1,4-glycosidic linkages. This directly targets the bond type that humans cannot cleave. The other options are either already present in human digestion (alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glycosidic hydrolases for starch, lipases for ester bonds in triglycerides, proteases for peptide bonds) or irrelevant to cellulose.\n\n5) Hence, the correct choice is the activity that hydrolyzes beta-1,4-glycosidic linkages.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2283543"}, {"introduction": "Beyond digestibility, the specific way monosaccharides are linked together determines a carbohydrate's chemical reactivity. This exercise asks you to classify common disaccharides as either \"reducing\" or \"non-reducing.\" Mastering this distinction is key to understanding many classical biochemical tests and reveals how a subtle structural detail—the status of the anomeric carbon—governs a molecule's chemical behavior. [@problem_id:2283504]", "problem": "In biochemistry, a carbohydrate is classified as a \"reducing sugar\" if its cyclic structure contains a hemiacetal or hemiketal group. This functional group allows the ring to open, exposing a free aldehyde or ketone carbonyl group that can be oxidized by a mild oxidizing agent (such as in Benedict's or Tollens' test), thereby \"reducing\" the agent. Conversely, if the anomeric carbons of all monosaccharide units are involved in glycosidic bonds, forming full acetals or ketals, the sugar is classified as \"non-reducing\" because its rings cannot open.\n\nConsider the following four common disaccharides:\n\n- **Maltose**: Composed of two D-glucose units joined by an $\\alpha$-1,4 glycosidic bond.\n- **Lactose**: Composed of a D-galactose unit and a D-glucose unit joined by a $\\beta$-1,4 glycosidic bond.\n- **Sucrose**: Composed of a D-glucose unit and a D-fructose unit joined by an $\\alpha-1, \\beta-2$ glycosidic bond.

Maltose\n\nB. Lactose\n\nC. Sucrose\n\nD. Cellobiose", "solution": "A disaccharide is reducing if at least one anomeric carbon remains as a hemiacetal or hemiketal, allowing ring opening to a free carbonyl that can be oxidized. It is non-reducing if the anomeric carbons are all engaged in glycosidic bonds forming full acetal or ketal linkages, preventing ring opening.\n\nFor maltose, two D-glucose residues are joined by an $\\alpha$-1,4 linkage, meaning the anomeric carbon $C1$ of the first glucose forms the glycosidic bond to $C4$ of the second glucose. The second glucose retains a free anomeric $C1$ as a hemiacetal, so maltose is reducing.\n\nFor lactose, D-galactose is linked to D-glucose by a $\\beta$-1,4 linkage from galactose $C1$ to glucose $C4$. The glucose anomeric $C1$ remains free as a hemiacetal, so lactose is reducing.\n\nFor cellobiose, two D-glucose units are linked by a $\\beta$-1,4 bond from the first glucose $C1$ to the second glucose $C4$, leaving the second glucose anomeric $C1$ free as a hemiacetal; thus cellobiose is reducing.\n\nFor sucrose, D-glucose and D-fructose are linked via an $\\alpha$-1, $\\beta$-2 glycosidic bond, connecting the anomeric $C1$ of glucose and the anomeric $C2$ of fructose. Both anomeric centers are engaged, forming an acetal (glucose) and a ketal (fructose), leaving no free hemiacetal/hemiketal. Therefore sucrose cannot open to a free carbonyl and is non-reducing.\n\nHence, the non-reducing disaccharide is sucrose.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2283504"}, {"introduction": "When starch is digested, the long polymer is broken down into glucose.
