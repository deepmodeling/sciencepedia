Even with a fixed set of atoms, carbon's flexible bonding allows for multiple structural arrangements, creating distinct molecules with unique properties and functional groups. This practice challenges you to work with the molecular formula $C_{3}H_{6}O$ to identify its constitutional isomers, a fundamental skill for navigating the vast landscape of organic chemistry and understanding the basis of molecular diversity [@problem_id:2323366].", "problem": "The versatility of carbon's bonding properties allows for the formation of a vast number of organic molecules from a limited set of atoms. Molecules that share the same molecular formula but have different structural arrangements are known as constitutional isomers. This structural diversity is a primary reason for the wide variety of functions performed by biomolecules.\n\nConsider the molecular formula $C_{3}H_{6}O$. Many stable isomers exist for this formula, each exhibiting unique chemical properties due to their different arrangements of atoms and resulting functional groups.\n\nFrom the options below, identify the set of three compounds that are all constitutional isomers with the molecular formula $C_{3}H_{6}O$ and where each compound represents a different class of organic molecule (i.e., has a different primary functional group).\n\nA. Propanal, Propanoic acid, Propan-1-ol\nB. Acetone, Propanal, Butanone\nC. Propanal, Acetone, Allyl alcohol\nD. Propan-1-ol, Propan-2-ol, Methoxyethane\nE. Propanal, Acetone, Prop-1-ene", "solution": "To determine the correct set, use the definition that constitutional isomers must have the same molecular formula but different connectivities, and the requirement that each compound must represent a different primary functional class. Therefore, each of the three compounds must have the formula $C_{3}H_{6}O$ and distinct functional groups.\n\nCheck option A: Propanal is an aldehyde with formula $C_{3}H_{6}O$. Propanoic acid is a carboxylic acid with formula $C_{3}H_{6}O_{2}$, which does not match $C_{3}H_{6}O$. Propan-1-ol is an alcohol with formula $C_{3}H_{8}O$, which also does not match $C_{3}H_{6}O$. Hence A fails the molecular formula requirement.\n\nCheck option B: Acetone (propanone) is a ketone with formula $C_{3}H_{6}O$. Propanal is an aldehyde with formula $C_{3}H_{6}O$. Butanone is a ketone with formula $C_{4}H_{8}O$, which does not match $C_{3}H_{6}O$. Additionally, even if formulas matched, two ketones would not satisfy the “different class” condition. Hence B is invalid.\n\nCheck option C: Propanal is an aldehyde with formula $C_{3}H_{6}O$. Acetone is a ketone with formula $C_{3}H_{6}O$. Allyl alcohol (prop-2-en-1-ol, structure $HO\\!-\\!CH_{2}\\!-\\!CH\\!=\\!CH_{2}$) is an alcohol; counting atoms gives $C_{3}H_{6}O$. These three are constitutional isomers (different connectivities) and belong to three different functional classes (aldehyde, ketone, alcohol). Hence C satisfies both requirements.\n\nCheck option D: Propan-1-ol, Propan-2-ol, and Methoxyethane all have formula $C_{3}H_{8}O$, not $C_{3}H_{6}O$, and two are alcohols, violating both conditions. Hence D is invalid.\n\nCheck option E: Propanal and Acetone both have formula $C_{3}H_{6}O$, but Prop-1-ene has formula $C_{3}H_{6}$ and lacks oxygen, so the formula does not match. Hence E is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only set meeting all criteria is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2323366"}, {"introduction": "The overall shape of a carbon skeleton, a direct result of isomerism, has profound effects on a molecule's macroscopic physical properties. This practice explores how the arrangement of a carbon chain—whether linear or branched—influences the strength of intermolecular attractions and, consequently, a property like boiling point. By comparing two isomers with the formula $C_{8}H_{18}$, you will discover the direct and predictable link between three-dimensional structure and physical behavior [@problem_id:2323397].", "problem": "Two organic compounds, n-octane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, are structural isomers, meaning they share the same molecular formula, $C_{8}H_{18}$, but differ in the arrangement of their atoms. The n-octane molecule has a linear, \"straight-chain\" carbon skeleton, whereas 2,2,4-trimethylpentane has a highly branched carbon skeleton, making its overall shape more compact and globular. Experimentally, it is observed that n-octane has a boiling point of $125.7^\\circ\\text{C}$, while 2,2,4-trimethylpentane has a significantly lower boiling point of $99.3^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best explanation for this observed difference in boiling points?\n\nA. The linear shape of n-octane allows for a greater effective surface area for intermolecular contact, leading to stronger London dispersion forces that require more energy to overcome compared to the more compact 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.\nB. The intramolecular covalent bonds in the branched structure of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane are weaker than those in n-octane due to steric strain, requiring less energy to break the molecules apart during boiling.\nC. Both molecules are nonpolar, but the branched structure of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane is more symmetrical, which induces a small permanent dipole moment, leading to repulsive forces that lower its boiling point.\nD. As isomers, both molecules have identical molecular masses. Therefore, the difference in boiling points must be due to the fact that the carbon-hydrogen bonds in n-octane are more polar than those in 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.\nE. The compact shape of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane allows the molecules to pack more densely in the liquid state, which paradoxically weakens the intermolecular forces and results in a lower boiling point.", "solution": "We identify the relevant intermolecular forces for the isomeric hydrocarbons $C_{8}H_{18}$. Both n-octane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane are nonpolar and lack functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding; thus, the dominant intermolecular force governing their boiling points is London dispersion forces. The cohesive interaction between two nonpolar molecules at separation $R$ can be modeled, at leading order, by a dispersion potential $U(R) \\approx -C_{6}R^{-6}$, where $C_{6}$ depends on the molecular polarizability and electronic structure. For molecules of identical formula (and hence very similar total polarizability), differences in $C_{6}$ and effective cohesive energy arise primarily from molecular shape and the resulting effective surface area available for intermolecular contact.\n\nFor chain-like molecules, extended conformations allow larger areas of close approach between neighboring molecules. The total dispersion interaction can be viewed as a sum over atom-atom contributions, each scaling roughly as $-c_{6,ij}r_{ij}^{-6}$; a more extended, linear shape increases the number and proximity of interacting pairs across the interface between two molecules, increasing the magnitude of the net attractive interaction. Consequently, the liquid’s cohesive energy and the enthalpy of vaporization $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$ increase. Since the boiling point correlates positively with $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$, the linear isomer exhibits a higher boiling point. In contrast, a compact, highly branched molecule presents a smaller effective contact area and fewer favorable close contacts on average, reducing the net dispersion attraction, lowering $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$, and thus lowering the boiling point.\n\nEvaluating the options: Option A correctly states that the linear shape of n-octane provides greater effective surface area, leading to stronger London dispersion forces and a higher boiling point relative to the compact, branched isomer. Option B is incorrect because boiling involves overcoming intermolecular forces, not breaking intramolecular covalent bonds; the strength of C–C and C–H bonds does not determine the boiling point for these hydrocarbons. Option C is incorrect because neither molecule has a permanent dipole; increased symmetry in the branched isomer does not induce a permanent dipole nor cause repulsive intermolecular forces that lower the boiling point. Option D is incorrect because as isomers their molecular masses are identical, but the polarity of C–H bonds does not differ meaningfully between isomers; the difference in boiling points is not due to C–H bond polarity. Option E is incorrect because denser packing does not weaken intermolecular forces; rather, the compact shape reduces effective contact area and therefore reduces dispersion attractions, which is the correct mechanism already captured in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2323397"}, {"introduction": "A molecule's structure not only determines its physical properties but also dictates its chemical reactivity, which is central to its function in biological systems. This practice focuses on how the atoms bonded to a carbon create a specific electronic environment, making certain sites prone to chemical reaction. By analyzing the acetyl group, a key functional unit in many biochemical processes, you will learn to identify electrophilic centers, a crucial step in understanding and predicting how molecules interact [@problem_id:2323370].", "problem": "In many biological systems, the post-translational modification of proteins via acetylation is a critical regulatory mechanism. This process often involves the enzymatic transfer of an acetyl group from a donor molecule to a specific amino acid residue on a target protein. Consider the structure of the acetyl group, which can be represented as $C_{\\alpha}H_{3}-C_{\\beta}O-$. In this notation, $C_{\\alpha}$ represents the methyl carbon and $C_{\\beta}$ represents the carbonyl carbon.\n\nDuring an acetylation reaction, a nucleophilic group on a protein, such as the amine group of a lysine residue, attacks the acetyl group, leading to the formation of a covalent bond. For this reaction to occur, one of the atoms in the acetyl group must act as an electrophilic center.\n\nBased on the principles of chemical bonding and electronegativity, which atom in the acetyl group is the primary electrophilic center, and what is the fundamental reason for its electrophilic character?\n\nA. The methyl carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$), because its proximity to the carbonyl group weakens its bonds to hydrogen.\nB. The carbonyl carbon ($C_{\\beta}$), because it is bonded to a highly electronegative oxygen atom which polarizes the carbon-oxygen double bond.\nC. The carbonyl oxygen, because as the most electronegative atom, it attracts incoming nucleophiles.\nD. The methyl carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$), because it is less sterically hindered than the carbonyl carbon, making it more accessible.\nE. The carbonyl carbon ($C_{\\beta}$), because the attached methyl group ($C_{\\alpha}H_3$) is electron-donating, which concentrates positive charge on $C_{\\beta}$.", "solution": "The acetyl group can be represented as $C_{\\alpha}H_{3}-C_{\\beta}(=O)-$. In a carbonyl, oxygen is significantly more electronegative than carbon, which polarizes the $C_{\\beta}=O$ double bond.

Consequently, $C_{\\beta}$ is the site attacked by nucleophiles, such as the amine of lysine, via nucleophilic acyl substitution.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: $C_{\\alpha}$ does not become electrophilic by proximity; its C–H bonds are not activated toward nucleophilic attack by the carbonyl in this context.\n- B is correct: $C_{\\beta}$ is electrophilic because the electronegative oxygen polarizes the $C_{\\beta}=O$ bond, rendering $C_{\\beta}$ electron-deficient.\n- C is incorrect: the carbonyl oxygen, bearing $\\delta^{-}$, is nucleophilic/basic, not electrophilic; it may be protonated but does not attract nucleophiles.\n- D is incorrect: steric accessibility does not override the fundamental electronic requirement; $C_{\\alpha}$ lacks the necessary positive polarization.\n- E is incorrect: an electron-donating methyl group would, if anything, decrease electrophilicity at $C_{\\beta}$ rather than concentrate positive charge there.\n\nTherefore, the primary electrophilic center is the carbonyl carbon $C_{\\beta}$ due to polarization by the oxygen atom.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2323370"}]}
