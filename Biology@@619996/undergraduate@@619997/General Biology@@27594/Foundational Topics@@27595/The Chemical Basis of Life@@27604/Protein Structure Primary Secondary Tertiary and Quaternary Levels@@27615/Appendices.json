This exercise challenges you to think like a protein engineer, predicting how specific changes in the primary sequence can impact structural stability. By analyzing the consequences of substituting an amino acid within a protein's hydrophobic core, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the forces, such as the hydrophobic effect, that govern protein folding and function. [@problem_id:2310426]", "problem": "A research team is investigating the structure of a newly discovered soluble, globular protein. Through X-ray crystallography, they determine that a specific amino acid, a leucine, is located in the hydrophobic core of the protein, shielded from the surrounding aqueous environment. The team decides to use site-directed mutagenesis to create two different versions of the protein to study the importance of this residue for structural integrity. In the first mutant, the leucine is replaced by an isoleucine. In the second mutant, the same leucine is replaced by a lysine.\n\nThe chemical structures of the relevant side chains are as follows:\n- Leucine: $-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$ (nonpolar)\n- Isoleucine: $-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_3$ (nonpolar)\n- Lysine: $-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{NH}_3^+$ (positively charged at physiological pH, hydrophilic)\n\nWhich of the following statements best predicts the outcome of these substitutions on the protein's tertiary structure and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. The substitution of leucine with isoleucine will cause a more drastic change because the different branching pattern of isoleucine's side chain will disrupt the precise packing of alpha-helices and beta-sheets.\nB. The substitution of leucine with lysine will cause a more drastic change because introducing a charged and hydrophilic residue into the stable, nonpolar hydrophobic core is highly energetically unfavorable.\nC. The substitution of leucine with isoleucine will cause a more drastic change because isoleucine is an essential amino acid, which inherently makes its substitutions more disruptive to protein function.\nD. The substitution of leucine with lysine will cause a more drastic change because lysine will form an unwanted ionic bond with a nearby acidic residue, locking the protein into a non-functional conformation.", "solution": "We analyze the effect of substituting a buried, hydrophobic leucine in the core of a soluble, globular protein with either a similarly hydrophobic isoleucine or a positively charged, hydrophilic lysine.\n\nFirst, we apply the hydrophobic effect and folding thermodynamics: the hydrophobic core of a globular protein is enriched in nonpolar side chains to minimize the exposure of hydrophobic surface area to water and to maximize favorable van der Waals packing in the core. Burying polar or charged groups in the core without compensating interactions (e.g., salt bridges or hydrogen-bond networks) is typically highly energetically unfavorable, because it entails a large desolvation penalty and poor dielectric screening.\n\nSecond, we examine the leucine to isoleucine substitution. Both leucine and isoleucine are nonpolar, aliphatic, with similar size and hydropathy; this is a conservative substitution. Although the branching positions differ (leucine is gamma-branched, isoleucine is beta-branched), both can sustain hydrophobic packing and van der Waals interactions in the core. Such a substitution usually causes minimal structural perturbation; at most, it may subtly adjust side-chain rotamers and local packing but does not typically disrupt the overall tertiary structure.\n\nThird, we examine the leucine to lysine substitution. Lysine introduces a positively charged, polar side chain. Burying a charged group in the hydrophobic core is strongly unfavorable unless there is pre-existing complementary charge or a network to neutralize or hydrogen-bond the charge. In the absence of such compensation, the free energy of folding increases (less favorable), driving destabilization, potential local unfolding, or rearrangements to expose the lysine side chain to solvent. This substitution is therefore far more disruptive to the tertiary structure than the conservative leucine to isoleucine change.\n\nFinally, we assess the given options:\n- Option A is incorrect: while branching differences can slightly affect packing, replacing leucine with isoleucine is a conservative, typically tolerated change and is unlikely to be more disruptive than introducing a charged residue.\n- Option B is correct: introducing a charged, hydrophilic residue into the hydrophobic core is highly energetically unfavorable and thus more disruptive.\n- Option C is incorrect: whether an amino acid is essential in the diet is irrelevant to the structural impact of a substitution within a protein.\n- Option D is not the best reasoning: although lysine could, in principle, form an ionic pair if a suitably positioned acidic residue exists, the general and dominant effect is the large penalty of burying charge; moreover, forming a compensatory salt bridge could mitigate, not necessarily exacerbate, disruption. The statement is speculative and less universally applicable than the general energetic argument in Option B.\n\nTherefore, the best prediction and reasoning are given by Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2310426"}, {"introduction": "Biochemists often act as detectives, using chemical tools to probe the invisible forces that stabilize complex protein assemblies. This problem presents you with an experimental observation and asks you to draw the most logical conclusion about a protein's quaternary structure. By considering the effect of a reducing agent that specifically targets covalent disulfide bonds, you will practice the critical skill of interpreting data to distinguish between the different types of interactions that hold protein subunits together. [@problem_id:2310459]", "problem": "A team of biochemists is studying a novel dimeric protein, named \"Cryolectin,\" isolated from the blood of an arctic fish. Cryolectin is composed of two identical polypeptide subunits. To investigate the forces maintaining its quaternary structure, the biochemists perform an experiment. They prepare a solution of purified Cryolectin and treat it with a high concentration of dithiothreitol (DTT), a strong reducing agent known to cleave covalent disulfide bonds. After the treatment, they use gel filtration chromatography and find that the protein still elutes at a size corresponding to the intact dimer. It does not dissociate into its constituent monomers.\n\nBased on this experimental observation, which of the following conclusions is the most valid?\n\nA. The quaternary structure of Cryolectin is primarily stabilized by non-covalent interactions such as hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and/or ionic bonds.\nB. The primary structure (the amino acid sequence) of the individual subunits is directly responsible for holding the two subunits together in the dimer.\nC. The quaternary structure of Cryolectin is exclusively stabilized by covalent disulfide bonds, which were resistant to the DTT treatment.\nD. The DTT treatment caused the protein subunits to become linked by new, different types of covalent bonds.\nE. The secondary structures (alpha-helices and beta-sheets) of the two subunits interlock so tightly that they cannot be separated without denaturing the entire protein.", "solution": "1) Identify the experimental manipulation and its biochemical effect: Dithiothreitol (DTT) is a strong reducing agent that specifically reduces covalent disulfide bonds between cysteine residues to free thiols. Therefore, if the dimerization of Cryolectin were mediated by intersubunit disulfide bonds, treatment with a high concentration of DTT would be expected to cleave those bonds and disrupt covalent linkage between subunits.\n\n2) Identify the analytical readout and its interpretation: Gel filtration chromatography separates proteins by hydrodynamic size. If Cryolectin were a covalently linked dimer that depends on disulfide bonds for its quaternary structure, reduction by DTT should yield monomers with a smaller hydrodynamic radius, shifting the elution to a later volume corresponding to monomer size. The observation is that the protein still elutes at the size of the intact dimer, indicating that the two subunits remain associated in solution under the conditions tested.\n\n3) Logical inference from the observed persistence of dimer after reduction: Since DTT reduces disulfide bonds, the fact that the dimer remains intact implies that disulfide bonds are not required to maintain the quaternary association under these conditions. Therefore, the dimer must be stabilized by non-covalent interactions (for example, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and ionic interactions), which are not disrupted by DTT.\n\n4) Evaluate each answer choice:\n- A: The quaternary structure being primarily stabilized by non-covalent interactions is directly supported by the observation that disrupting covalent disulfide bonds does not dissociate the dimer. This is the most valid conclusion.\n- B: While the primary structure encodes the capacity to form higher-order structures, it does not “directly” hold subunits together; the actual forces are non-covalent interactions (and sometimes disulfide bonds). This statement misattributes the mechanism.\n- C: Exclusive stabilization by disulfide bonds is contradicted by the persistence of the dimer after strong reduction; furthermore, claiming resistance of disulfides to high DTT without evidence is unwarranted.\n- D: DTT is a reductant and does not generate new covalent cross-links between polypeptide chains under these conditions; thus this is not supported.\n- E: One cannot conclude that the interlocking of secondary structures precludes separation without denaturation; the experiment only shows that reduction alone is insufficient to dissociate the dimer, not that denaturation is required. This overstates the data.\n\n5) Therefore, the most valid conclusion consistent with the experiment is that Cryolectin’s quaternary structure is maintained primarily by non-covalent interactions, not by disulfide bonds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2310459"}, {"introduction": "In the age of genomics, predicting a protein's structure from its primary sequence is a fundamental skill in bioinformatics. This advanced practice introduces you to the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot, a powerful method for identifying hydrophobic regions likely to form transmembrane helices in membrane proteins.

The full-length polypeptide consists of 510 amino acid residues. To predict its tertiary structure, a Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis was performed using a scanning window of 19 residues. For a segment of the polypeptide to be considered a stable transmembrane alpha-helix, two criteria must be met: first, the segment must be at least 20 amino acids long, and second, its average hydropathy index over the entire segment length must be greater than +1.8.\n\nThe analysis identified the following contiguous regions of the polypeptide where the hydropathy index consistently exceeded +1.8:\n- Region 1: Residues 45-68\n- Region 2: Residues 81-98\n- Region 3: Residues 125-150\n- Region 4: Residues 158-181\n- Region 5: Residues 230-252\n- Region 6: Residues 305-329\n- Region 7: Residues 370-388\n- Region 8: Residues 421-444\n- Region 9: Residues 480-503\n\nExperimental evidence from protein tagging has definitively established that the N-terminus of Aquaporin-Z is located in the extracellular space.
