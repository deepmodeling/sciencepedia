By applying your knowledge of the structures of a triglyceride, a phospholipid, and cholesterol, you can predict their anaytical behavior and reinforce your understanding of how molecular structure dictates physical properties.", "problem": "A biochemist is analyzing a lipid extract obtained from cultured animal cells. The extract is known to be a mixture of three primary lipids: triolein (a triglyceride), phosphatidylcholine (a phospholipid), and cholesterol (a steroid). To separate these components, the biochemist performs Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC). The stationary phase is a silica gel plate ($\\text{SiO}_2 \\cdot n\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$), which is known to be highly polar. The mobile phase is a non-polar solvent mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate.\n\nThe initial mixture is spotted on a line designated as the origin. The solvent is then allowed to ascend the plate. After the run, the solvent front has traveled a total distance of 15.0 cm from the origin. Three distinct spots, labeled 1, 2, and 3, are visualized on the plate. The center of each spot is measured to be at the following distances from the origin:\n\n- Spot 1: 3.3 cm\n- Spot 2: 7.8 cm\n- Spot 3: 13.5 cm\n\nThe Retardation factor ($R_f$) for a compound is defined as the ratio of the distance traveled by the compound's spot to the distance traveled by the solvent front. Based on the fundamental principles of chromatography and the relative polarities of the three lipid types, which of the following options correctly identifies the molecule corresponding to each spot and provides the correct Retardation factor ($R_f$) for cholesterol?\n\nA.

Conversely, less polar analytes interact weakly with the stationary phase and travel farther.\n\nAmong the given lipids, the relative polarity is: phosphatidylcholine (highly polar, zwitterionic headgroup) is most polar, cholesterol (one hydroxyl group with a largely hydrophobic sterol nucleus) is intermediate, and triolein (neutral triacylglycerol) is the least polar. Therefore, on silica with a non-polar solvent, the expected migration order from shortest to longest distance is phosphatidylcholine, then cholesterol, then triolein.\n\nThe retardation factor is defined by the chromatography principle:\n$$\nR_{f}=\\frac{d_{\\text{compound}}}{d_{\\text{solvent front}}}.\n$$\nHere, the solvent front distance is $d_{\\text{solvent front}}=15.0$. The measured compound distances from the origin are $3.3$, $7.8$, and $13.5$. Assigning identities by polarity and migration:\n- Spot 1 at $3.3$ corresponds to phosphatidylcholine (most polar, shortest distance).\n- Spot 2 at $7.8$ corresponds to cholesterol (intermediate).\n- Spot 3 at $13.5$ corresponds to triolein (least polar, farthest distance).\n\nThe $R_{f}$ for cholesterol (Spot 2) is\n$$\nR_{f,\\text{cholesterol}}=\\frac{7.8}{15.0}=0.52.\n$$\nThis assignment and value correspond to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2300774"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their structural roles, the primary function of lipids like triglycerides is long-term energy storage. Fatty acids are incredibly energy-dense molecules, and their catabolism through beta-oxidation yields a substantial amount of ATP. This practice problem [@problem_id:2300833] challenges you to perform a detailed bioenergetic calculation, comparing the ATP yield from a saturated fatty acid to that of a monounsaturated one. This hands-on accounting exercise will deepen your understanding of the beta-oxidation pathway and reveal how even a small structural difference, like a single double bond, alters the metabolic process and final energy output.", "problem": "A biochemist is evaluating the energy yield from two common C18 fatty acids. The first is stearic acid (18:0), a fully saturated fatty acid. The second is oleic acid (18:1), a monounsaturated fatty acid with a single *cis*-double bond located between carbons 9 and 10 (counting from the carboxyl carbon). You are tasked with calculating the difference in the net Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) yield from the complete aerobic oxidation of one molecule of each fatty acid.\n\nFor your calculations, use the following standard metabolic conversion values and rules:\n1.  The initial activation of any fatty acid in the cytosol requires an investment equivalent to 2 ATP molecules.\n2.  Each cycle of beta-oxidation that cleaves a two-carbon acetyl-CoA unit from a *saturated* portion of the acyl-CoA chain produces 1 FADH2 and 1 NADH.\n3.  The complete oxidation of each resulting acetyl-CoA molecule through the citric acid cycle produces 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, and 1 GTP (which is energetically equivalent to 1 ATP).\n4.  The processing of the *cis*-double bond in oleic acid requires an isomerase enzyme. This allows beta-oxidation to proceed but bypasses the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase step for that particular cycle. As a result, 1 FADH2 molecule is *not* generated during the cycle that processes the double bond.\n5.  In the electron transport chain, each molecule of NADH generates 2.5 ATP, and each molecule of FADH2 generates 1.5 ATP.\n\nCalculate the difference in total net ATP yield, defined as (Net ATP from stearic acid) - (Net ATP from oleic acid).

By analyzing a clinical scenario involving anti-inflammatory drugs, you will learn to predict the systemic consequences of inhibiting a biochemical pathway at different points. This practice demonstrates how a fundamental understanding of lipid metabolism is directly applicable to pharmacology and the development of targeted therapies.", "problem": "A patient is being treated for a severe chronic inflammatory condition with a high-dose regimen of a standard Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID), which functions as a non-selective Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor.

Laboratory analysis of the patient's serum reveals that while levels of inflammatory prostaglandins are significantly suppressed, the levels of inflammatory leukotrienes are paradoxically elevated. As a next-line treatment, the physician considers prescribing an experimental drug that is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of cytosolic Phospholipase A2 (cPLA2).\n\nAssuming the new drug is administered and is effective, which of the following describes the most likely and direct biochemical outcome of switching from the COX inhibitor to the cPLA2 inhibitor?\n\nA.
