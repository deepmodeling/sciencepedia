Before we can appreciate the complex biochemical differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, we must understand the physical constraints that governed their evolution. This exercise uses a simple diffusion model to explore why cell size is a critical factor, demonstrating quantitatively ($t \\propto L^2$) why the large size of eukaryotic cells necessitates a more complex internal architecture than that found in their smaller prokaryotic counterparts.

We will model a typical prokaryotic cell and a typical eukaryotic cell as simple spheres. The prokaryotic cell has a diameter of $1.0\\ \\mu\\text{m}$, while the eukaryotic cell has a diameter of $20\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nA small molecule, such as glucose, must travel from the cell membrane to various locations within the cell to be utilized. The characteristic time for a molecule to diffuse across a certain distance is a key factor in the efficiency of cellular processes. Assume the cytoplasm in both cells has a consistency such that the diffusion coefficient for this small molecule is $D = 5.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$.\n\nCalculate the approximate time it would take for the molecule to diffuse from the cell periphery (membrane) to the cell's geometric center for both the prokaryote and the eukaryote. Based on your calculations, select the option below that presents the correct approximate times and the most accurate biological conclusion. For the purposes of this problem, the time values presented in the options have been rounded to two significant figures.\n\nA. Prokaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $1.0\\ \\text{s}$. The substantial increase in diffusion time for the eukaryote suggests that passive diffusion is too slow to support the metabolic needs of a large cell, necessitating the evolution of active intracellular transport systems.\n\nB. Prokaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $0.050\\ \\text{s}$. The diffusion time scales linearly with cell radius, so the 20-fold increase in radius leads to a 20-fold increase in time, a manageable difference that does not require specialized transport.\n\nC. Prokaryote: $5.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $0.20\\ \\text{s}$. The much longer diffusion time in eukaryotes is primarily due to their more structured and dense cytoplasm, which increases the effective diffusion distance.\n\nD. Prokaryote: $1.0\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$. The faster diffusion in eukaryotes demonstrates that their complex endomembrane system creates efficient channels for molecular transport, making them superior to prokaryotes.\n\nE. Prokaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $1.0\\ \\text{s}$. On a biological timescale, these two durations are functionally equivalent. Therefore, active transport systems in eukaryotes must have evolved for purposes other than overcoming diffusion limitations, such as targeted delivery to specific organelles.", "solution": "The characteristic diffusive time across a distance is estimated from the mean-square displacement relation for diffusion.

Moreover, diffusion time scales as $t \\propto L^{2}$, so the 20-fold increase in radius from prokaryote to eukaryote yields roughly a 400-fold increase in diffusion time (from milliseconds to about one second), indicating that passive diffusion becomes limiting over eukaryotic length scales and supporting the biological conclusion that active intracellular transport systems are necessary in larger cells.

In the native bacterium, this mechanism allows for the coordinated synthesis of all three proteins: CynA, CynB, and CynC. The structure of the mRNA is represented as:\n\n`5' - [5' Untranslated Region (UTR)] - [AUG start codon for cynA] - [cynA coding sequence] - [UAA stop codon] - [intercistronic spacer 1] - [AUG start codon for cynB] - [cynB coding sequence] - [UGA stop codon] - [intercistronic spacer 2] - [AUG start codon for cynC] - [cynC coding sequence] - [UAG stop codon] - [3' UTR] - 3'`\n\nIn a genetic engineering experiment, the biologist clones the entire DNA segment corresponding to the cyto operon (including its bacterial promoter) into a mammalian expression vector.

CynA and CynC only", "solution": "The fundamental distinction between bacterial and eukaryotic translation initiation determines which open reading frames (ORFs) are translated from a given mRNA.\n\n1) In bacteria, each cistron in a polycistronic mRNA is typically preceded by a Shine-Dalgarno sequence that base pairs with the 16S rRNA to recruit a ribosome independently to each start codon. This enables independent initiation at the AUG for each ORF (cynA, cynB, cynC).\n\n2) In eukaryotes, canonical initiation is cap-dependent and scanning-based. The 43S preinitiation complex binds the 5' cap via eIF4F (including eIF4E) and scans in the 5' to 3' direction until it encounters the first AUG in an appropriate Kozak context, where it initiates translation. After elongation and termination at the stop codon, the 80S ribosome dissociates, and reinitiation on downstream ORFs is generally inefficient and does not occur under canonical conditions unless specialized features are present.\n\n3) In the engineered hamster cells, the mRNA is correctly capped and polyadenylated. Under canonical eukaryotic mechanisms, the ribosome will bind at the 5' cap and scan to the first AUG, which is the start codon for cynA. Translation will initiate at this AUG and proceed until the UAA stop codon for cynA.\n\n4) Upon termination at the cynA stop codon, the ribosomal subunits dissociate. Because canonical eukaryotic initiation does not support internal entry at downstream AUGs in the absence of specialized elements (such as internal ribosome entry sites) and because Shine-Dalgarno sequences in the intercistronic spacers are not recognized by eukaryotic ribosomes, the downstream ORFs (cynB and cynC) will not be translated.\n\n5) Therefore, only the first cistron, cynA, is translated into protein under the stated assumptions of canonical eukaryotic translation.\n\nConclusion: Only CynA will be produced.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2288103"}]}
