To do this, they must first calibrate the ocular micrometer, which is a small ruler installed in the microscope's eyepiece. The calibration is performed using a stage micrometer, a specialized slide with a ruler etched on it where the smallest divisions are known to be separated by a distance of 10.0 micrometers (µm).\n\nThe student sets the microscope to a total magnification of 400x and aligns the ocular micrometer with the stage micrometer. They observe that a length spanning 7 divisions on the stage micrometer corresponds precisely to a length spanning 50 divisions on the ocular micrometer.\n\nAfter completing the calibration, the student removes the stage micrometer and replaces it with a slide containing Paramecium cells. They measure the length of a single Paramecium and find that it spans 38 divisions on the ocular micrometer.\n\nCalculate the actual length of the Paramecium cell. Express your answer in micrometers (µm), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The calibration principle is that a physical length measured on the stage micrometer must equal the corresponding length on the ocular micrometer when viewed at the same magnification.\n\nLet the stage micrometer smallest division length be $s=10.0$ micrometers. The observation states that $7$ stage divisions correspond to $50$ ocular divisions. If $d$ is the physical length per ocular division (in micrometers), then the equality of lengths gives\n$$\n7s=50d.\n$$\nSolving for $d$,\n$$\nd=\\frac{7s}{50}=\\frac{7\\cdot 10.0}{50}=1.40 \\text{ micrometers per ocular division}.\n$$\nWith the specimen slide, the Paramecium spans $38$ ocular divisions.

It is known that the N-terminus of T7 is located in the extracellular space. To determine the location of the C-terminus, they genetically fused a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) tag to the C-terminus of T7, creating the T7-GFP construct.\n\nThey conducted an experiment using three populations of live mammalian cells:\n1.  **Control A:** Cells expressing \"Glyco-GFP,\" a known transmembrane protein with its C-terminal GFP tag located in the extracellular space.\n2.  **Control B:** Cells expressing soluble GFP, which freely diffuses within the cytoplasm.\n3.  **Experimental:** Cells expressing the T7-GFP construct.\n\nFor each cell population, the average initial fluorescence intensity per cell ($I_0$) was measured. Subsequently, Trypan Blue, a molecule that quenches GFP fluorescence but cannot permeate the plasma membrane, was added to the extracellular medium. After incubation, the average final fluorescence intensity per cell ($I_f$) was measured. The results are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Cell Population | Construct | Initial Intensity $I_0$ (arbitrary units) | Final Intensity $I_f$ (arbitrary units) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Control A | Glyco-GFP (extracellular tag) | 850 | 187 |\n| Control B | Cytoplasmic GFP | 920 | 915 |\n| Experimental | T7-GFP | 890 | 258 |\n\nThe quenching efficiency, $\\eta$, is defined by the relation $\\eta = \\frac{I_0 - I_f}{I_0}$.\n\nBased on the provided data, calculate the quenching efficiency for the T7-GFP construct and use the controls to determine the subcellular location of its C-terminus.

This advanced practice moves beyond simple measurement to the analysis of motion, using the Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) to characterize how a receptor protein moves within the cell membrane [@problem_id:2303181]. By analyzing the anomalous diffusion exponent, $\\alpha$, you can classify the protein's movement into distinct biophysical modes, revealing its interactions with the surrounding environment.", "problem": "In a Single-Particle Tracking (SPT) experiment, the two-dimensional trajectory of a single fluorescently-labeled receptor protein embedded in a live cell membrane is recorded over a long period. The goal is to analyze the receptor's dynamics, which can vary as it moves through different microdomains of the membrane. The primary tool for this analysis is the Mean Squared Displacement (MSD), which measures the average squared distance a particle travels over a time interval (or lag) $\\tau$. For a 2D trajectory, the MSD is defined as $\\text{MSD}(\\tau) = \\langle (x(t+\\tau) - x(t))^2 + (y(t+\\tau) - y(t))^2 \\rangle_t$, where the angle brackets denote an average over all possible start times $t$.\n\nIn many biophysical systems, the MSD follows a power law: $\\text{MSD}(\\tau) \\propto \\tau^\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless parameter known as the anomalous diffusion exponent. The value of $\\alpha$ is a key indicator of the particle's mode of motion:\n1.  **Free Diffusion:** The particle moves without constraints in a purely viscous fluid. This corresponds to classical Brownian motion, for which $\\alpha = 1$.\n2.  **Anomalous Subdiffusion:** The particle's movement is hindered, for instance by obstacles or crowding within the membrane. This results in slower displacement over time compared to free diffusion, characterized by an exponent $0 < \\alpha < 1$.\n3.  **Confined Diffusion:** The particle is trapped within a small region or \"corral\" of the membrane. In this case, the MSD will initially increase but then plateau at long time lags as the particle fully explores the confined space. This behavior leads to an effective anomalous exponent $\\alpha \\approx 0$ when measured over a sufficiently long time scale.\n\nAn analyst has taken a long recorded trajectory and divided it into three sequential, non-overlapping 10-second segments, labeled Segment 1, Segment 2, and Segment 3. For each segment, the anomalous exponent $\\alpha$ was computed from a power-law fit to the MSD curve. Additionally, the maximum displacement, $d_{\\text{max}}$, which is the greatest distance the particle moved from its position at the start of that segment, was calculated. The results are as follows:\n\n-   **Segment 1:** Anomalous exponent $\\alpha_1 = 0.15$; Maximum displacement $d_{\\text{max},1} = 80$ nm.\n-   **Segment 2:** Anomalous exponent $\\alpha_2 = 0.70$; Maximum displacement $d_{\\text{max},2} = 350$ nm.\n-   **Segment 3:** Anomalous exponent $\\alpha_3 = 0.99$; Maximum displacement $d_{\\text{max},3} = 900$ nm.\n\nBased on these parameters, what is the most likely mode of motion for Segment 1, Segment 2, and Segment 3, respectively?\n\nA.

Many biophysical systems exhibit a power-law MSD, modeled as $MSD(\\tau)=K\\tau^{\\alpha}$, where $K$ is a generalized transport coefficient and $\\alpha$ is the anomalous diffusion exponent. The mode of motion is inferred from $\\alpha$ and corroborated by the observed spatial extent. For free diffusion in two dimensions, the theory of Brownian motion gives $MSD(\\tau)=4D\\tau$, so $\\alpha=1$. For anomalous subdiffusion, hindered motion produces $0  \\alpha  1$. For confined diffusion, the MSD approaches a constant at long lags, $\\lim_{\\tau\\to\\infty}\\text{MSD}(\\tau)=\\text{const}$, which on sufficiently long time scales yields an effective $\\alpha \\approx 0$. The maximum displacement $d_{\\text{max}}$ provides additional evidence: a small $d_{\\text{max}}$ supports confinement, while a large $d_{\\text{max}}$ is consistent with freer exploration of space. Applying these criteria: Segment 1 has $\\alpha_{1}=0.15$, close to $0$, and $d_{\\text{max},1}=80$ nm is small, both indicating confined diffusion. Segment 2 has $\\alpha_{2}=0.70$, which lies strictly between $0$ and $1$ and is not close to $1$, consistent with anomalous subdiffusion; the intermediate $d_{\\text{max},2}=350$ nm supports hindered but not tightly confined motion. Segment 3 has $\\alpha_{3}=0.99\\approx 1$ and the largest $d_{\\text{max},3}=900$ nm, consistent with free diffusion.
