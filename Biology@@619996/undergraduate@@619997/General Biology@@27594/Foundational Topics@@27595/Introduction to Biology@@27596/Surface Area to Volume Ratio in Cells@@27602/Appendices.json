To explore this, consider a simplified model comparing a spherical prokaryotic cell and a spherical eukaryotic cell.\n\nThe prokaryotic cell has a radius $r_p$. The eukaryotic cell is also spherical with a radius $r_e$ that is exactly 10 times larger than the prokaryotic cell, such that $r_e = 10 r_p$.
