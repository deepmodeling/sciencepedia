This initial sampling event itself can have dramatic consequences for genetic diversity, much like drawing only a few marbles from a large, multicolored bag might miss some colors entirely. This exercise guides you through calculating the probability that a rare allele is completely lost during the founding of a new population, highlighting the immediate risks of such events to a population's genetic heritage [@problem_id:2297017].", "problem": "A conservation program establishes a new, isolated population of Skyline Finches on a remote island to protect the species. The founding group consists of 10 diploid individuals randomly selected from a large mainland population. In the mainland population, a rare recessive allele, which causes silver-tipped feathers, has a frequency of $q = 0.01$. The presence of this allele is considered a marker of genetic diversity.\n\nAssuming the selection of individuals for the founding group is a random sampling of alleles from the mainland gene pool and that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, calculate the probability that the silver-tipped feather allele is completely absent in the initial founding group of 10 finches. Round your final answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let the recessive silver-tipped allele have frequency $q$ in the mainland population. Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the dominant allele frequency is $p = 1 - q$, and genotype frequencies are $AA: p^{2}$, $Aa: 2pq$, and $aa: q^{2}$.\n\nThe allele is completely absent in the founding group if and only if no founder carries it, which requires all $10$ sampled diploid individuals to be $AA$. The probability a single randomly sampled individual is $AA$ is $p^{2}$. Assuming random, independent sampling from a large population, the probability all $10$ individuals are $AA$ is\n$$\n(p^{2})^{10} = p^{20}.\n$$\nEquivalently, viewing the sampling as $2 \\times 10 = 20$ independent allele draws, the probability that none of the $20$ sampled alleles is the recessive allele is\n$$\n(1 - q)^{20},\n$$\nwhich is identical to $p^{20}$.\n\nWith $q = 0.01$, we have $p = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$, so the required probability is\n$$\n0.99^{20} \\approx 0.8179\n$$\nrounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8179}$$", "id": "2297017"}, {"introduction": "The rate at which genetic drift alters allele frequencies is governed not by the total number of individuals in a population (census size), but by the 'effective population size,' denoted as $N_e$. This crucial metric reflects the size of an idealized population that would experience the same amount of genetic drift. This practice demonstrates how real-world factors, such as a skewed sex ratio in a founding group, can cause $N_e$ to be much smaller than the actual census size, thereby accelerating the loss of genetic variation [@problem_id:2297001].", "problem": "A conservation program is re-establishing a population of the critically endangered Island Fox on a remote sanctuary island.

This exercise presents a classic scenario pitting selection against drift, asking you to determine the most likely fate of a single, new beneficial mutation. You will explore the counterintuitive but fundamental principle that even a helpful allele has a high probability of being lost by chance, powerfully illustrating that drift can sometimes overwhelm the directional force of selection [@problem_id:2297023].", "problem": "A conservation program establishes a new, isolated population of a rare marsupial species on a protected island. The founding population consists of $N = 50$ diploid individuals. Shortly after establishment, a beneficial mutation arises in a single individual's germline cells. This new allele is not initially present in any other individual. The allele confers a selective advantage, denoted by $s = 0.01$, related to improved immune response. Assuming the population size remains constant and mating is random, determine the most likely fate of this new beneficial allele.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the outcome?\n\nA. The allele is more likely to be lost from the population than to become fixed.\n\nB. The allele is more likely to become fixed in the population than to be lost.\n\nC. The allele is equally likely to be lost or to become fixed.\n\nD. The allele's fate cannot be determined without knowing if it is dominant or recessive.\n\nE. The allele will persist at a low frequency but will be unable to become fixed due to the small population size.", "solution": "We model the allele frequency dynamics in a constant-size, randomly mating diploid population using the Wrightâ€“Fisher framework with selection. The founding population has $N$ diploid individuals, so there are $2N$ gene copies at the locus. A new mutation arising in a single copy has initial frequency\n$$\np_{0}=\\frac{1}{2N}.\n$$\nUnder genic (additive) selection with coefficient $s>0$, the diffusion approximation gives the fixation probability of an allele starting at frequency $p$ as\n$$\nu(p)=\\frac{1-\\exp(-4Ns\\,p)}{1-\\exp(-4Ns)}.\n$$\nSubstituting $p=p_{0}=\\frac{1}{2N}$ yields\n$$\nu=\\frac{1-\\exp(-2s)}{1-\\exp(-4Ns)}.\n$$\nTwo standard regimes describe the outcome. If $2Ns\\gg 1$ and $s$ is small, then $1-\\exp(-4Ns)\\to 1$ and $1-\\exp(-2s)\\approx 2s$, giving\n$$\nu\\approx 2s,\n$$\nwhich is much less than $\\frac{1}{2}$ for small $s$ (in particular, for any $s<\\frac{1}{4}$). If $2Ns\\ll 1$, a series expansion gives $1-\\exp(-2s)\\approx 2s$ and $1-\\exp(-4Ns)\\approx 4Ns$, hence\n$$\nu\\approx \\frac{2s}{4Ns}=\\frac{1}{2N},\n$$\nwhich is also strictly less than $\\frac{1}{2}$ for all $N\\geq 1$. Thus, in either drift-dominated or selection-dominated regimes relevant to a single new copy, the fixation probability is far below one-half, implying loss is more likely than fixation.\n\nRegarding dominance, if the allele is beneficial recessive, selection is initially ineffective because the allele appears in heterozygotes; this reduces the fixation probability below the genic/additive case, making loss even more likely. If the allele is additive or dominant, the initial fixation probability is on the order of $2s$, still much less than one-half for small $s$. Therefore, knowing dominance is unnecessary to conclude the direction of the imbalance between loss and fixation probabilities.\n\nBecause a single new beneficial allele with small $s$ in a population of size $N$ has $u\\ll \\frac{1}{2}$, it is more likely to be lost than to become fixed. Hence, the most accurate choice is that the allele is more likely to be lost from the population than to become fixed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2297023"}]}
