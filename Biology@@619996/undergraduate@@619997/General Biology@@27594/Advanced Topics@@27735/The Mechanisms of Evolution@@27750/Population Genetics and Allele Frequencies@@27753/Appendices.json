This involves determining the frequencies of different alleles for a given gene. This hands-on practice provides a foundational exercise in calculating allele frequencies directly from observed genotype counts, a method often called \"gene counting.\" Mastering this skill is essential, as these empirical frequencies are the raw data upon which our understanding of evolutionary processes is built [@problem_id:2308831].", "problem": "In a research project studying pesticide resistance in an agricultural pest, the Colorado potato beetle (*Leptinotarsa decemlineata*), scientists investigate a large, isolated population. Resistance to a specific neonicotinoid insecticide is determined to be controlled by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele conferring resistance, which we will denote as $B$, and a recessive allele for susceptibility, denoted as $b$. After a season of insecticide application, a random sample of the beetle population is collected and genotyped. The sample contains 490 individuals with the homozygous dominant genotype ($BB$), 420 individuals with the heterozygous genotype ($Bb$), and 90 individuals with the homozygous recessive genotype ($bb$).\n\nBased on this sample, calculate the frequency of the resistance allele ($B$) in this beetle population.

The total number of $B$ alleles in the sample is given by $2n_{BB} + n_{Bb}$, since each $BB$ individual contributes two $B$ alleles and each $Bb$ individual contributes one $B$ allele. The total number of alleles is $2N$. Therefore, the sample frequency of the $B$ allele is\n$$\np_{B} = \\frac{2n_{BB} + n_{Bb}}{2N}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given counts $n_{BB} = 490$, $n_{Bb} = 420$, $n_{bb} = 90$, we compute $N = 490 + 420 + 90 = 1000$, and\n$$\np_{B} = \\frac{2\\cdot 490 + 420}{2\\cdot 1000} = \\frac{1400}{2000} = 0.7.\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures yields $0.700$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.700}$$", "id": "2308831"}, {"introduction": "While direct counting is useful, we often cannot distinguish all genotypes just by observing phenotypes, especially with dominant and recessive traits.

A comprehensive census of the population reveals that 1 in 40,000 individuals has AP.
