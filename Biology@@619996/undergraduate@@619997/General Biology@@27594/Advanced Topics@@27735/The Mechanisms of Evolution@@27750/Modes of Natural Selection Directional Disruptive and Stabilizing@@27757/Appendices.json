{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Directional selection occurs when environmental pressures consistently favor individuals at one end of the phenotypic spectrum, causing the population average to shift over time. This exercise [@problem_id:2303901] explores a classic real-world example of human-induced directional selection in a fish population. By analyzing the impact of size-selective fishing nets, you will develop an intuition for how a persistent selective force can drive rapid evolutionary change in a specific direction.", "problem": "A team of marine biologists is studying a commercially valuable fish species in a specific oceanic region. For many decades, this region has been subjected to intensive fishing using nets that have a regulated minimum mesh size. Due to this regulation, smaller and younger fish can often swim through the net's openings and escape, while larger, more mature fish are consistently captured.\n\nAfter analyzing historical and recent data on the population, the biologists have confirmed a significant evolutionary trend: the average body size at which individuals of this species reach sexual maturity is progressively decreasing. This means that, on average, the fish are now reproducing at a smaller size and a younger age compared to their ancestors from fifty years ago.\n\nAssuming no other significant environmental changes or evolutionary pressures are at play, which of the following statements most accurately identifies and describes the primary mode of natural selection acting on the 'size at sexual maturity' trait in this fish population?\n\nA. Stabilizing selection, because the nets remove the non-optimal, larger individuals, thereby favoring an intermediate, more stable phenotype for the population.\n\nB. Disruptive selection, because both the very small fish that escape and the very large, fecund \"trophy\" fish that are sometimes thrown back are favored over intermediate sizes.\n\nC. Directional selection, because a specific environmental pressure is consistently favoring individuals at one extreme of the phenotypic range (smaller size), causing the population-wide average for the trait to shift in that direction.\n\nD. Genetic drift, because the capture of fish is a random sampling event that, by chance, has led to a shift in the allele frequencies governing maturation size in the surviving population.\n\nE. Gene flow, because the fishing pressure has induced migration from a neighboring, unfished population where the allele for smaller maturation size is more common.", "solution": "We identify the trait under selection as size at sexual maturity. The fishing nets impose a consistently size-dependent viability selection: individuals above the mesh size are disproportionately removed before reproducing, while smaller individuals pass through the mesh and survive to reproduce. Thus, relative fitness decreases with increasing size, implying a negative selection gradient on size.\n\nFormally, if $z$ denotes size at sexual maturity, then a monotonic decline of fitness with $z$ implies a nonzero directional selection gradient $\\beta = \\frac{\\partial \\ln w}{\\partial z} < 0$. Under quantitative genetic response, the mean trait changes according to the Lande equation $\\Delta \\bar{z} = G \\beta$ or the breederâ€™s equation $\\Delta \\bar{z} = h^{2} S$, where $G$ is additive genetic variance, $h^{2}$ is heritability, and $S$ is the selection differential. A consistently negative $\\beta$ (or $S$) yields a sustained decrease in $\\bar{z}$, matching the observed long-term shift to smaller maturation size. This is the hallmark of directional selection.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\nA. Stabilizing selection would remove both extremes and favor an intermediate optimum, reducing variance around a fixed mean. Here, selection removes primarily one extreme (large size), and the mean shifts progressively downward. This is not stabilizing selection.\nB. Disruptive selection favors both extremes over intermediates, often increasing variance and potentially producing a bimodal distribution. The described pressure favors only one extreme (smaller size) and disfavors large individuals; intermediates are not favored over large, nor are both extremes favored. This is not disruptive selection.\nC. Directional selection occurs when fitness systematically increases toward one end of the phenotypic range, shifting the population mean in that direction. The mesh-size fishing consistently favors smaller, earlier-maturing individuals; the observed long-term reduction in maturation size is exactly the predicted outcome of directional selection with $\\beta < 0$.\nD. Genetic drift causes random changes in allele frequencies without a consistent direction and is not phenotype-dependent. The documented, consistent, long-term shift aligned with a clear phenotype-dependent mortality regime is not explained by drift.\nE. Gene flow requires migration introducing alleles from other populations. The scenario attributes the change to within-population selection by fishing; no migration is invoked, and the assumption excludes other significant pressures.\n\nTherefore, the primary mode is directional selection favoring smaller size at sexual maturity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2303901"}, {"introduction": "Not all selection pushes populations towards an extreme; often, the most successful phenotype is the one closest to the average, a process known as stabilizing selection. This practice [@problem_id:2303842] provides a quantitative look at how this mode operates on a wildflower population under selection from a specialized pollinator. By calculating the change in phenotypic variance after one generation, you will see firsthand how stabilizing selection reduces diversity by penalizing individuals that deviate from a well-adapted norm.", "problem": "In a stable ecosystem, the wildflower *Floribunda spectabilis* is exclusively pollinated by a species of hawk moth, *Manduca exacta*. The number of petals on a *F. spectabilis* flower is a discrete, heritable trait. Field biologists have observed that the moths exhibit a strong behavioral preference, preferentially visiting flowers that have the species-typical petal count. This preference directly impacts the reproductive success of the plants.\n\nConsider an initial generation (P0) of 100,000 *F. spectabilis* plants with the following distribution of petal counts:\n- 5 petals: 2,000 plants\n- 6 petals: 10,000 plants\n- 7 petals: 20,000 plants\n- 8 petals: 36,000 plants\n- 9 petals: 20,000 plants\n- 10 petals: 10,000 plants\n- 11 petals: 2,000 plants\n\nThe pollination success, which translates to the relative fitness ($w$) of each phenotype, has been quantified as follows:\n- 8 petals: $w = 1.00$\n- 7 or 9 petals: $w = 0.60$\n- 6 or 10 petals: $w = 0.20$\n- 5 or 11 petals: $w = 0.05$\n\nAssume that the number of seeds produced by any successfully pollinated flower is constant, regardless of its petal count. Also, assume that the petal count trait is perfectly heritable, meaning the distribution of phenotypes in the offspring (the F1 generation) is identical to the distribution of phenotypes among the successfully reproducing parent plants.\n\nCalculate the phenotypic variance of the petal count in the F1 generation.

The distribution of phenotypes in the F1 generation will be determined by the distribution of the successfully reproducing individuals in the P0 generation.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of successfully reproducing individuals for each phenotype.\nWe multiply the number of individuals of each phenotype in the P0 generation ($N_i$) by their respective relative fitness ($w_i$) to find the contribution of each phenotype to the next generation's gene pool.
