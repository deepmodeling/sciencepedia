These two microhabitats are often located just meters from one another, but the two moss species are never found cohabitating on the same substrate.\n\nIn a controlled laboratory environment, researchers find that they can successfully produce viable and fertile hybrid offspring by manually transferring male gametes (sperm) from one species to the female reproductive structures (archegonia) of the other.

Reproductive barriers are mechanisms that prevent different species from producing viable, fertile offspring. They are broadly categorized as prezygotic (preventing fertilization) or postzygotic (acting after fertilization).\n\nLet's analyze the given information:\n1.  The two species are distinct but live in the same general geographic area (sympatric).\n2.  They occupy different microhabitats: one on granite, the other on decaying wood. This is a key piece of information.\n3.  They do not interbreed in nature.\n4.  Laboratory-assisted fertilization results in viable and fertile offspring. This is also a crucial fact, as it allows us to rule out several potential barriers.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Gametic Isolation: This is a prezygotic barrier where the gametes (sperm and egg) of the two species are incompatible and cannot fuse to form a zygote. Since the problem explicitly states that manual cross-fertilization in the lab is successful, we know the gametes are compatible. Therefore, gametic isolation is not the primary barrier.\n\nB. Mechanical Isolation: This is a prezygotic barrier where morphological differences in reproductive structures prevent successful mating or pollen transfer. The problem states the mosses are \"morphologically indistinguishable,\" and more importantly, manual fertilization is possible. This indicates that there are no major physical incompatibilities preventing fertilization, so mechanical isolation is not the primary barrier.\n\nC. Habitat Isolation (also known as Ecological Isolation): This is a prezygotic barrier in which two species occupy different habitats, even within the same geographic region, and thus do not encounter each other to mate. The scenario describes exactly this situation: one moss species lives on granite rocks, and the other lives on decaying logs. Because of these specific substrate requirements, the two species are physically separated, preventing the transfer of sperm between them in their natural environment. This perfectly explains why they remain distinct despite being able to hybridize in a lab.\n\nD. Temporal Isolation: This is a prezygotic barrier where two species reproduce at different times of the day, in different seasons, or in different years. While this could potentially be a contributing factor, the information provided in the problem does not mention anything about their reproductive timing. The most direct and strongly supported barrier described is the difference in habitat. Therefore, habitat isolation is the primary barrier identified in the text.\n\nE. Hybrid Breakdown: This is a postzygotic barrier where first-generation (F1) hybrids are viable and fertile, but when they mate with each other or with either parent species, their offspring (the F2 generation) are feeble or sterile. Postzygotic barriers only come into play *after* a hybrid has been formed. Since the problem states that the two species do not hybridize in nature, a postzygotic mechanism like hybrid breakdown cannot be the *primary* barrier preventing gene flow. The barrier must be prezygotic.\n\nF. Reduced Hybrid Viability: This is a postzygotic barrier where the genes of different parent species interact in a way that impairs the hybrid's development or survival. The problem directly contradicts this by stating that lab-produced hybrids are \"viable.\" Therefore, reduced hybrid viability is not the primary barrier.\n\nBased on the analysis, the clear and primary barrier preventing gene flow between the two moss species in the wild is their separation into different microhabitats. This is the definition of habitat isolation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2312844"}, {"introduction": "Reproductive barriers can be remarkably precise, acting like clocks that separate species in time. This exercise explores temporal isolation, a prezygotic barrier where species have different mating schedules. By applying mathematical reasoning to the unique life cycles of hypothetical \"prime-cycle\" crickets, you will calculate when the next potential opportunity for hybridization could occur, demonstrating how biological phenomena can be modeled and predicted quantitatively [@problem_id:2312838].", "problem": "In a specific ecological preserve, biologists are studying two closely related but distinct species of \"prime-cycle\" crickets, *Gryllus primus* and *Gryllus secundus*. These insects exhibit a unique life strategy, spending most of their lives underground as nymphs and emerging synchronously as adults to mate only once every several years. This periodic emergence is a key component of their reproductive strategy.\n\n*Gryllus primus* has a life cycle of exactly 13 years.\n*Gryllus secundus* has a life cycle of exactly 17 years.\n\nThis difference in their life cycle lengths functions as a powerful temporal reproductive barrier. However, hybridization is theoretically possible during the rare years when both species emerge simultaneously. A complicating factor is a virulent fungal pathogen, *Entomophthora grylli*, which is lethal to the adult forms of both cricket species. This pathogen has a reliable cycle of its own, reaching peak spore-producing activity every 4 years. Successful mating and potential hybridization between the two cricket species can only occur in a year of co-emergence when the fungal pathogen is *not* at its peak activity.\n\nField records show that a major emergence of both *Gryllus primus* and *Gryllus secundus* occurred in the year 2020. In that same year, the *Entomophthora grylli* fungus was also observed at its peak activity.\n\nAssuming these cycles continue without deviation, what is the first year after 2020 in which a potential hybridization event between *Gryllus primus* and *Gryllus secundus* could occur?", "solution": "Let the emergence periods be $P_{1}=13$ years for Gryllus primus and $P_{2}=17$ years for Gryllus secundus.

Substitute $y=2020+221k$ and reduce modulo $4$:\n$$\ny \\equiv 2020+221k \\equiv 0 + (221 \\bmod 4)\\,k \\pmod{4}.\n$$\nSince $221=4 \\cdot 55 + 1$, we have $221 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, hence\n$$\ny \\equiv k \\pmod{4}.\n$$\nTo avoid a fungal peak, we need $y \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, which gives $k \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. The smallest positive integer satisfying this is $k=1$, yielding\n$$\ny=2020+221 \\cdot 1=2241.\n$$\nThis is the first year after 2020 in which both species co-emerge and the pathogen is not at peak activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2241}$$", "id": "2312838"}, {"introduction": "Beyond barriers that prevent mating, postzygotic barriers operate after fertilization, often due to negative interactions between genes from different parent species.

In the ancestral population, a vital metabolic pathway producing a required product, Q, is catalyzed by two enzymes encoded by two unlinked genes, `G1` and `G2`. The ancestral (wild-type) alleles are `G1_W` and `G2_W`.\n\nOver time, Population A has become fixed for a new, selectively neutral allele `G1_A` at the `G1` locus. Its genotype is `G1_A/G1_A ; G2_W/G2_W`.\nSimilarly, Population B has become fixed for a different new, selectively neutral allele `G2_B` at the `G2` locus. Its genotype is `G1_W/G1_W ; G2_B/G2_B`.\n\nAn individual plant is viable only if its cells can successfully execute the metabolic pathway to produce product Q. This requires the presence of at least one functional pair of enzymes. An enzyme from the `G1` locus must work with an enzyme from the `G2` locus. The enzyme produced by allele `G1_A` and the enzyme produced by allele `G2_B` are biochemically incompatible; when they are the only pair present, the pathway fails and no product Q is made.
