This first exercise [@problem_id:2297381] provides direct practice in calculating allele frequencies from observed genotype counts, a scenario simplified by the use of an organism with incomplete dominance where phenotype directly reveals genotype. Mastering this \"allele counting\" method is the essential first step for any Hardy-Weinberg analysis.", "problem": "A field biologist is studying a large, isolated population of wild snapdragons (*Antirrhinum majus*). In this plant species, the gene for flower color exhibits incomplete dominance. The allele for red flowers, denoted as $C^R$, and the allele for white flowers, denoted as $C^W$, combine in heterozygotes to produce pink flowers ($C^R C^W$). Individuals with the $C^R C^R$ genotype have red flowers, and those with the $C^W C^W$ genotype have white flowers.\n\nIn a comprehensive census of a specific meadow, the biologist counted all flowering plants. The survey recorded 892 plants with red flowers, 951 plants with pink flowers, and 237 plants with white flowers.\n\nBased on these observed phenotype counts, calculate the frequency of the red allele ($C^R$) in this population. Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Because flower color shows incomplete dominance, each phenotype maps uniquely to genotype: red corresponds to $C^{R}C^{R}$, pink to $C^{R}C^{W}$, and white to $C^{W}C^{W}$. Thus, the observed counts give the genotype counts directly:\n- $N_{RR} = 892$,\n- $N_{RW} = 951$,\n- $N_{WW} = 237$.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of individuals:\n$$\nN = N_{RR} + N_{RW} + N_{WW} = 892 + 951 + 237 = 2080.\n$$\nIn a diploid population, the frequency of the red allele $C^{R}$, denoted $p$, is given by\n$$\np = \\frac{2N_{RR} + N_{RW}}{2N}.\n$$\nSubstituting the counts,\n$$\np = \\frac{2\\cdot 892 + 951}{2\\cdot 2080} = \\frac{1784 + 951}{4160} = \\frac{2735}{4160}.\n$$\nComputing the decimal and rounding to three significant figures,\n$$\np \\approx 0.657.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.657}$$", "id": "2297381"}, {"introduction": "The Hardy-Weinberg principle acts as a powerful predictive tool, allowing us to estimate the frequency of genotypes that cannot be directly observed, such as heterozygous carriers of a recessive allele.
