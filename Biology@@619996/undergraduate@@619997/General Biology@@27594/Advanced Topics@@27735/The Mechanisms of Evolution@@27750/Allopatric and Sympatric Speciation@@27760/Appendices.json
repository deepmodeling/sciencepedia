[@problem_id:1487844]", "problem": "An ecologist is studying two distinct cases of speciation.\n\nCase 1: A contiguous population of fire-bellied salamanders inhabits a large, humid valley. Over a period of several million years, significant tectonic uplift leads to the formation of a high, arid mountain range that bisects the valley, creating two geographically isolated habitats. The salamanders cannot cross this new mountain barrier. Consequently, the two separated salamander populations cease to interbreed and begin to accumulate distinct genetic differences, eventually becoming separate species.\n\nCase 2: In a single, large meadow, a species of grass, *Poa annua*, reproduces sexually. A rare error in meiosis within one plant results in the production of diploid (2n) gametes instead of the usual haploid (n) gametes. Self-fertilization of this plant leads to a tetraploid (4n) offspring. This new tetraploid plant is healthy and fertile, but when it is back-crossed with the original diploid (2n) parent population, the resulting triploid (3n) offspring are sterile. This effectively establishes a new, reproductively isolated population of tetraploid grasses within the same meadow as the original diploid population.\n\nBased on these two cases, which of the following correctly classifies the primary mode of speciation for the salamanders and the grass, respectively?\n\nA. Sympatric speciation; Allopatric speciation\n\nB. Allopatric speciation; Sympatric speciation\n\nC. Sympatric speciation; Sympatric speciation\n\nD. Allopatric speciation; Allopatric speciation\n\nE. Parapatric speciation; Peripatric speciation", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must first understand the definitions of the primary modes of speciation, particularly allopatric and sympatric speciation.\n\nAllopatric speciation occurs when a population is divided by a geographic barrier, leading to reproductive isolation. The term \"allopatric\" is derived from Greek roots meaning \"other fatherland,\" referring to the populations occupying different geographic areas. Gene flow between the separated populations is prevented, allowing them to diverge independently through processes like natural selection, genetic drift, and mutation.\n\nSympatric speciation occurs when a new species evolves from a single ancestral species while both continue to inhabit the same geographic region. The term \"sympatric\" means \"same fatherland.\" In this case, reproductive isolation arises not from a physical barrier but from other mechanisms, such as polyploidy (changes in chromosome number), habitat differentiation, or sexual selection.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two cases provided in the problem.\n\nCase 1 involves the salamander population. The key event is the formation of a mountain range that physically separates the original population into two. This mountain range acts as a geographic barrier, preventing interbreeding (gene flow) between the two groups. Over time, this isolation leads to genetic divergence and the formation of new species. This scenario is a classic example of allopatric speciation.\n\nCase 2 involves the grass species *Poa annua*. A new type of grass (tetraploid, 4n) arises from the original population (diploid, 2n) within the same meadow. The critical point is that this new tetraploid plant is reproductively isolated from its diploid ancestors because their hybrid offspring (triploid, 3n) are sterile. This reproductive barrier arises from a genetic event (polyploidy) and not from geographic separation. Since the new species arose within the same geographic area as the parent species, this is a clear example of sympatric speciation.\n\nTherefore, the speciation in the salamanders is allopatric, and the speciation in the grass is sympatric. Matching this conclusion with the given options:\n- A. Sympatric speciation; Allopatric speciation (Incorrect)\n- B. Allopatric speciation; Sympatric speciation (Correct)\n- C. Sympatric speciation; Sympatric speciation (Incorrect)\n- D. Allopatric speciation; Allopatric speciation (Incorrect)\n- E. Parapatric and Peripatric are other modes of speciation but do not fit the classic descriptions provided in the problem. Parapatric involves adjacent populations with some gene flow, and peripatric is a form of allopatric where a small peripheral population becomes isolated. Neither perfectly describes the scenarios as well as allopatric and sympatric do. (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct classification is allopatric speciation for the salamanders and sympatric speciation for the grass.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1487844"}, {"introduction": "After populations diverge in allopatry, they sometimes come back into contact. If hybridization results in low-fitness offspring, natural selection can favor traits that reduce interbreedingâ€”a process called reinforcement. This practice explores a measurable consequence of reinforcement known as character displacement, where species' traits become more different in areas of sympatry. You will use hypothetical data from newt populations to quantitatively assess this phenomenon, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and empirical evidence. [@problem_id:2276828]", "problem": "Two closely related species of newts, *Triturus vividus* and *Triturus umbra*, have distributions that were once geographically separated (allopatric) but now overlap in a narrow region of secondary contact (sympatry). In this sympatric zone, interspecific breeding occurs. However, the resulting hybrid offspring are viable but produce non-functional gametes, leading to zero reproductive fitness for the hybrids. This creates selective pressure against hybridization.\n\nA group of evolutionary biologists hypothesizes that this pressure has led to reproductive character displacement, specifically in the coloration of the male tail fin, which is a key trait in female mate choice. To test this, they collected data on the peak reflectance wavelength of the tail fin from male newts in three distinct zones: an allopatric zone for *T. vividus*, an allopatric zone for *T. umbra*, and the sympatric zone where both species are found.\n\nThe collected data are summarized as follows:\n- **Allopatric *T. vividus***: Mean peak wavelength $\\mu_{V,A} = 480$ nm; Standard Deviation $\\sigma_{V,A} = 12$ nm.\n- **Allopatric *T. umbra***: Mean peak wavelength $\\mu_{U,A} = 590$ nm; Standard Deviation $\\sigma_{U,A} = 15$ nm.\n- **Sympatric *T. vividus***: Mean peak wavelength $\\mu_{V,S} = 465$ nm; Standard Deviation $\\sigma_{V,S} = 11$ nm.\n- **Sympatric *T. umbra***: Mean peak wavelength $\\mu_{U,S} = 610$ nm; Standard Deviation $\\sigma_{U,S} = 14$ nm.\n\nTo quantify the degree of character displacement, the researchers define a Character Displacement Index (CDI) as the ratio of the magnitude of divergence in the sympatric zone to the magnitude of divergence in the allopatric zones. The formula is given by:\n$$\nCDI = \\frac{|\\mu_{V,S} - \\mu_{U,S}|}{|\\mu_{V,A} - \\mu_{U,A}|}\n$$\nA value of CDI greater than 1 suggests that character displacement is occurring.\n\nUsing the provided data, calculate the Character Displacement Index for the male tail fin coloration.

This advanced exercise places you in the role of a predictive biologist, using a quantitative model to determine if a population, soon to be fragmented by climate change, will have enough time to evolve into separate species. By calculating the fixation time for key alleles that cause hybrid inviability, you will determine if speciation can win the race against future geological events. This practice synthesizes population genetics and speciation theory to model evolution in a changing world.

Climate models predict that within the next century, rising temperatures will render the central valley uninhabitable, splitting the population into two isolated refugia at higher elevations: North Peak and South Peak. Biologists are interested in whether this period of allopatry will be sufficient for speciation to occur before a subsequent cooling trend re-establishes a connecting corridor.\n\nGenetic analysis has identified two key loci, Locus A and Locus B, which are under strong divergent selection in the two refugia.\n- In North Peak, a new allele, $A_N$, which confers enhanced UV radiation tolerance, arises as a single mutation and is favored with a selection coefficient of $s_A = 0.008$.\n- In South Peak, a new allele, $B_S$, which provides tolerance to a unique soil mineral composition, arises as a single mutation and is favored with a selection coefficient of $s_B = 0.005$.\n\nSpeciation in this system is expected to occur via the evolution of a Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibility (DMI). Specifically, hybrid individuals that inherit both the $A_N$ allele from a North Peak parent and the $B_S$ allele from a South Peak parent are inviable. For the purposes of this model, complete reproductive isolation is considered to be achieved only when allele $A_N$ has reached fixation in the North Peak population and allele $B_S$ has reached fixation in the South Peak population.\n\nAssume that each refugium, once isolated, maintains a constant effective population size of $N_e = 50,000$. The climate models predict that the connecting corridor will be re-established after $T_{contact} = 4,000$ generations of isolation, initiating secondary contact.\n\nThe approximate time to fixation (in generations) for a new, advantageous allele with selection coefficient $s$ in a population of effective size $N_e$ can be modeled as:\n$$T_{fix} = \\frac{2}{s}\\ln(2N_e)$$\n\nCalculate the \"speciation margin,\" which is defined as the time of secondary contact minus the time required for complete reproductive isolation to evolve.

According to the problem statement, complete reproductive isolation is achieved only when *both* allele $A_N$ has fixed in the North Peak population and allele $B_S$ has fixed in the South Peak population. These two fixation events occur in parallel in their respective isolated populations. The total time required for this condition to be met is governed by the slower of the two processes. Therefore, $T_{speciation}$ will be the maximum of the two fixation times.\n\nLet $T_{fix,A}$ be the time to fixation for allele $A_N$ in the North Peak population, and $T_{fix,B}$ be the time to fixation for allele $B_S$ in the South Peak population.\n$$T_{speciation} = \\max(T_{fix,A}, T_{fix,B})$$\n\nWe are given the formula for the time to fixation: $T_{fix} = \\frac{2}{s}\\ln(2N_e)$.\nThe parameters are:\n- Effective population size, $N_e = 50,000$\n- Selection coefficient for $A_N$, $s_A = 0.008$\n- Selection coefficient for $B_S$, $s_B = 0.005$\n- Time until secondary contact, $T_{contact} = 4,000$ generations\n\nNow, we calculate each fixation time.\nFor the North Peak population (allele $A_N$):\n$$T_{fix,A} = \\frac{2}{s_A}\\ln(2N_e) = \\frac{2}{0.008}\\ln(2 \\times 50,000)$$\n$$T_{fix,A} = 250 \\ln(100,000)$$\nThe natural logarithm of 100,000 is $\\ln(10^5) = 5\\ln(10)$.
