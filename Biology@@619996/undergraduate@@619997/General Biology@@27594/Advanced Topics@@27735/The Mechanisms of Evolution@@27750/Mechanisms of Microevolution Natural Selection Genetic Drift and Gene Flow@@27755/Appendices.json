This scenario illustrates the founder effect, a classic example of genetic drift. By calculating the probability of losing an allele purely by the chance sampling of founders, you will gain a concrete understanding of how this powerful, random mechanism can dramatically and unpredictably shape the genetic landscape of a new population [@problem_id:2302261].", "problem": "A large, stable mainland population of diploid lizards is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a single gene that determines scale coloration. There are two alleles for this gene: a dominant allele $B$, which produces black scales, and a recessive allele $b$, which produces brown scales. In the mainland population, the frequency of the allele $B$ is $p = 0.8$.\n\nFollowing a severe storm, a small group of 5 lizards is swept away and colonizes a remote, previously uninhabited island. You may assume this group of 5 lizards constitutes a random sample from the large mainland population. This founding event establishes a new, isolated island population.\n\nCalculate the probability that the recessive allele $b$ is completely absent in the founding group of 5 lizards. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that the recessive allele $b$ is completely absent from the founding population of 5 lizards. This is equivalent to calculating the probability that all 5 lizards in the founding group are homozygous dominant, having the genotype $BB$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the frequency of the $BB$ genotype in the source mainland population. The problem states that the mainland population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We are given the frequency of the dominant allele $B$, which is $p = 0.8$. The frequency of the recessive allele $b$ is $q$. Since there are only two alleles, their frequencies must sum to 1.\n$$q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\n\nAccording to the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the frequencies of the three genotypes ($BB$, $Bb$, and $bb$) in a population at equilibrium are given by $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$, respectively. We are interested in the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype, $BB$.\n$$\\text{Frequency of } BB = p^2$$\nSubstituting the given value of $p$:\n$$\\text{Frequency of } BB = (0.8)^2 = 0.64$$\nThis frequency represents the probability of randomly selecting a single lizard with the $BB$ genotype from the mainland population.\n\nThe founding group consists of 5 lizards, and we are told to assume they are a random sample. The selection of each lizard is an independent event. Therefore, the probability that all 5 lizards chosen for the founding group have the $BB$ genotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n$$P(\\text{all 5 are } BB) = (P(\\text{one lizard is } BB))^5$$\nSubstituting the calculated probability for a single lizard:\n$$P(\\text{all 5 are } BB) = (0.64)^5$$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$P(\\text{all 5 are } BB) = 0.64 \\times 0.64 \\times 0.64 \\times 0.64 \\times 0.64 = 0.1073741824$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$0.1073741824 \\approx 0.1074$$\n\nThus, the probability that the recessive allele $b$ is completely absent from the new founding population is 0.1074.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1074}$$", "id": "2302261"}, {"introduction": "Both the founding of a new colony and a catastrophic reduction of an existing one result in a small population, making them susceptible to genetic drift. However, are their long-term evolutionary fates identical? This practice challenges you to compare and contrast a founder effect with a population bottleneck, pushing you to consider how factors like geographic isolation and the potential for future gene flow create divergent evolutionary trajectories [@problem_id:2302281].", "problem": "Consider a large, stable mainland population of 10,000 Crimson-Tufted Marmosets. Within this population, a gene controlling ear tuft coloration has two alleles: a dominant allele $T$ for crimson tufts and a recessive allele $t$ for orange tufts. The allele frequencies in the mainland population are 70% for $T$ and 30% for $t$.\n\nTwo separate events occur:\n\n1.  **Event 1 (The Voyage):** A group of 10 marmosets, randomly sampled from the mainland population, are unintentionally transported by a cargo ship to a remote, habitable island with no other marmosets. They successfully establish a new, isolated island population.\n2.  **Event 2 (The Plague):** A sudden, virulent plague sweeps through the mainland, affecting marmosets indiscriminately with respect to tuft color. The plague reduces the population to just 10 survivors, who then form the basis of a recovering mainland population.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately compares the expected long-term genetic consequences for the new island population (from Event 1) and the recovering mainland population (from Event 2)?\n\nA. The island population is subject to the founder effect, and the mainland population to a bottleneck effect; both will experience significant genetic drift, but the mainland population has a greater long-term potential to recover genetic diversity through gene flow with neighboring populations.\n\nB. The 10 survivors of the plague are better adapted to their environment than the 10 shipwrecked individuals, so the recovering mainland population will have a higher mean fitness and evolve more rapidly due to natural selection than the island population.\n\nC. The founder effect on the island will lead to a greater loss of overall genetic diversity than the bottleneck effect on the mainland because the founding individuals are a purely random sample, whereas the survivors of the plague were actively selected for their ability to survive.\n\nD. Both populations will have nearly identical long-term genetic outcomes because they both start with 10 individuals and are therefore subject to the same intensity of random genetic drift, which will be the dominant evolutionary force.\n\nE. The island population has a higher probability of undergoing speciation due to its complete reproductive isolation, while the mainland population is almost certain to go extinct due to inbreeding depression and a lack of genetic diversity.", "solution": "Let the mainland allele frequencies before either event be $p=\\Pr(T)$ and $q=\\Pr(t)$ with $p+q=1$. Random mating at large size implies Hardyâ€“Weinberg expectations at the locus, but the key forces here will be sampling, drift, migration, and selection.\n\nEvent 1 (The Voyage) is a founder event. A founding group of $N_{0}=10$ diploid individuals carries $2N_{0}$ gene copies sampled from the mainland. The founder allele frequency $\\hat{p}$ satisfies $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{p}]=p$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{p})=\\frac{pq}{2N_{0}}$ under binomial sampling of $2N_{0}$ gene copies. There is a nonzero probability of immediate allele loss by sampling. For example, loss of $t$ at founding occurs with probability $(1-q)^{2N_{0}}=p^{2N_{0}}$, and loss of $T$ occurs with probability $(1-p)^{2N_{0}}=q^{2N_{0}}$. After founding, the island is reproductively isolated, so the migration rate $m=0$. Genetic drift on the island reduces heterozygosity through time according to\n$$\nH_{t}=H_{0}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\\right)^{t},\n$$\nwhere $N_{e}$ is the effective population size on the island. With no gene flow, any loss of alleles or heterozygosity caused by the founder event and subsequent drift cannot be replenished by migration, and random divergence from the mainland can persist and even increase. Reproductive isolation also increases the long-term probability of divergence sufficient for speciation, though speciation is not guaranteed.\n\nEvent 2 (The Plague) is a bottleneck. The plague is described as indiscriminate with respect to tuft color, so survival is independent of genotype at this locus; equivalently, the selection coefficient against any genotype at this locus is $s=0$ during the mortality event. Thus, the $N_{0}=10$ survivors constitute a random sample from the pre-plague gene pool, producing the same sampling properties as above: $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{p}]=p$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{p})=\\frac{pq}{2N_{0}}$, and the same immediate probabilities of allele loss by sampling, $p^{2N_{0}}$ or $q^{2N_{0}}$. However, after the bottleneck, the mainland population can recover to a large size, so subsequent drift weakens as $N_{e}$ increases, with heterozygosity decay per generation scaled by $1-\\frac{1}{2N_{e}}$ approaching $1$ as $N_{e}$ becomes large. Crucially, because the mainland is not isolated, there is a realistic possibility of gene flow from neighboring populations at a migration rate $m>0$. Under migration, allele frequency change is\n$$\n\\Delta p = m\\left(p_{\\text{source}}-p\\right),\n$$\nand migration replenishes allelic diversity and raises heterozygosity toward the level in the source populations. In contrast, the island has $m=0$.\n\nEvaluate the options against these principles:\n- Option B is incorrect because the plague is indiscriminate; there is no evidence of differential survival by genotype at this locus, so no reason to predict higher mean fitness or faster evolution by selection in the recovering mainland than on the island.\n- Option C is incorrect because it asserts active selection among plague survivors; by problem statement, survival is random with respect to tuft color, so both events involve random sampling (founder effect vs bottleneck), not directional selection.\n- Option D is incorrect because long-term outcomes differ: although both start at $N_{0}=10$ and thus initially experience strong drift, the island is isolated with $m=0$, whereas the mainland has potential gene flow ($m>0$) and larger $N_{e}$ after recovery, enabling greater restoration of genetic diversity and different trajectories.\n- Option E is incorrect because extinction of the mainland is not a near certainty; risks such as inbreeding depression may occur, but recovery in size and gene flow can mitigate them. While isolation can increase the probability of speciation on the island, that does not by itself imply near-certain extinction for the mainland.\n\nOption A correctly identifies founder effect on the island and bottleneck on the mainland, recognizes that both will experience significant genetic drift, and correctly notes that the mainland has greater long-term potential to recover genetic diversity via gene flow with neighboring populations, unlike the isolated island.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2302281"}, {"introduction": "Natural selection and genetic drift are two of the most important forces of evolution, but they do not act in a vacuum; they often operate simultaneously. This exercise explores the tug-of-war between them, focusing on a scenario where balancing selection works to maintain diversity while drift tends to eliminate it.

The fitness of the heterozygote is normalized to $W_{12} = 1$. The homozygous genotypes, $A_1A_1$ and $A_2A_2$, are less fit due to poorer camouflage against the island's terrain. Their fitness values are given in terms of selection coefficients, $s_1$ and $s_2$, such that $W_{11} = 1 - s_1$ and $W_{22} = 1 - s_2$. For this population, the selection coefficients have been measured as $s_1 = 0.20$ and $s_2 = 0.10$.\n\nA sudden volcanic eruption causes a severe population bottleneck, drastically reducing the effective population size to a small number, $N_e$. In this small population, the influence of genetic drift may become strong enough to overpower the balancing selection that maintains the polymorphism.\n\nA widely used criterion in population genetics states that genetic drift is expected to be a more dominant evolutionary force than natural selection when the magnitude of the selection coefficient ($s$) is less than the reciprocal of twice the effective population size ($1/(2N_e)$).\n\nAssuming this criterion, calculate the critical effective population size, $N_c$, below which genetic drift would be considered a more powerful force than the weaker of the two selective pressures that maintain the polymorphism.", "solution": "The population exhibits overdominance with fitnesses $W_{11}=1-s_{1}$, $W_{12}=1$, and $W_{22}=1-s_{2}$, where $s_{1}=0.20$ and $s_{2}=0.10$. The criterion for drift dominating selection is that the magnitude of the selection coefficient satisfies $|s|<\\frac{1}{2N_{e}}$.\n\nTo find the critical effective population size $N_{c}$ at which drift and selection are equally strong for the weaker selective pressure, set the inequality to equality using the weaker coefficient $s=\\min(s_{1},s_{2})$:\n$$\n|s|=\\frac{1}{2N_{c}}.\n$$\nIdentify the weaker selection coefficient:\n$$\ns=\\min(s_{1},s_{2})=\\min(0.20,0.10)=0.10.\n$$\nSolve for $N_{c}$:\n$$\nN_{c}=\\frac{1}{2s}=\\frac{1}{2\\times 0.10}=\\frac{1}{0.20}=5.\n$$\nThus, for $N_{e}<5$, genetic drift is expected to dominate over the weaker of the two selective pressures maintaining the polymorphism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "2302253"}]}
