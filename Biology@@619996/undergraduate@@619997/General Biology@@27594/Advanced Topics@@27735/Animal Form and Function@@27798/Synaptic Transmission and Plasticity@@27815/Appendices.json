This practice uses a thought experiment involving a hypothetical toxin to isolate one of the most critical steps: the trigger for neurotransmitter release. By exploring the consequences of blocking presynaptic calcium channels, you can solidify your understanding of how an electrical signal (the action potential) is converted into a chemical signal, a process known as excitation-secretion coupling. [@problem_id:2315953]", "problem": "A team of neurophysiologists is studying the effects of a newly isolated compound, calciseptine, on synaptic transmission at a model chemical synapse. Their experiments reveal that calciseptine is a highly specific antagonist that binds to and completely blocks all voltage-gated calcium channels located on the membrane of the presynaptic axon terminal. The compound has no other known effects on the neuron. Consider a scenario where an action potential successfully propagates down the axon and arrives at a presynaptic terminal that has been pre-treated with calciseptine. What is the most immediate and direct consequence at the presynaptic terminal?\n\nA. The presynaptic terminal membrane will not depolarize in response to the arriving action potential.\n\nB. Acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter at this synapse, will be broken down by enzymes before it can be released.\n\nC. The reuptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft into the presynaptic terminal will be inhibited.\n\nD. The action potential will be reflected back up the axon away from the terminal.\n\nE. Synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitter will fail to fuse with the presynaptic membrane.", "solution": "Calciseptine is specified to bind to and completely block all voltage-gated calcium channels on the presynaptic terminal membrane, with no other effects. When an action potential arrives, the presynaptic membrane still depolarizes because the action potential propagation and the terminal depolarization are mediated by voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels upstream and by passive spread of charge into the terminal; these are not affected by a calcium-channel antagonist. Therefore, option A is not correct.\n\nThe key presynaptic step for neurotransmitter release is calcium-dependent vesicle fusion. In normal physiology, terminal depolarization opens presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, producing a calcium current $I_{Ca}$ that raises intracellular calcium concentration and triggers synaptotagmin-mediated SNARE complex activation and vesicle fusion. The calcium current can be expressed as\n$$\nI_{Ca} = g_{Ca} \\left(V_{m} - E_{Ca}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $g_{Ca}$ is the calcium conductance determined by the number of open calcium channels, $V_{m}$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{Ca}$ is the calcium reversal potential. Complete blockade of the channels sets the open probability to zero, so the effective conductance is\n$$\ng_{Ca} = 0 \\implies I_{Ca} = 0.\n$$\nWith $I_{Ca} = 0$, there is no activity-dependent calcium influx, hence\n$$\n\\Delta [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{i} \\approx 0.\n$$\nThe probability of vesicle fusion is a steep, supralinear function of intracellular calcium, commonly modeled as\n$$\nP_{\\text{release}} \\propto \\left([\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}\\right)^{n}, \\quad n > 1,\n$$\nso with no rise in $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$, it follows that\n$$\nP_{\\text{release}} \\to 0,\n$$\nand synaptic vesicles fail to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. Therefore, the most immediate and direct consequence is failure of vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.\n\nOption B concerns enzymatic breakdown of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase in the cleft, which occurs only after release; with blocked calcium entry, release does not occur, so this is not the immediate consequence. Option C addresses reuptake, which requires neurotransmitter to be present in the cleft; again, with no release, reuptake is not the immediate limiting step and is not directly inhibited by calcium channel blockade. Option D, reflection of the action potential, is not a physiological consequence of presynaptic calcium channel blockade and does not occur under these conditions.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitter will fail to fuse with the presynaptic membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2315953"}, {"introduction": "A single neuron often receives thousands of tiny inputs, some excitatory and some inhibitory.

This practice explores the molecular basis of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a key form of synaptic strengthening. By examining the distinct roles of AMPA and NMDA receptors in a scenario where NMDA receptors are selectively blocked, you will uncover why they are often called \"coincidence detectors,\" essential for linking strong presynaptic activity to a lasting change in synaptic efficacy. [@problem_id:2315981]", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the mechanisms of memory formation using slices of the hippocampus, a brain region critical for learning. The study focuses on a specific type of synapse that uses glutamate as its primary neurotransmitter. These synapses have two main types of glutamate receptors on the postsynaptic membrane:\n\n1.  **AMPA Receptors**: When glutamate binds to these receptors, they open a channel permeable to sodium ions (Na⁺), leading to depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron.\n2.  **NMDA Receptors**: These receptors are unique. They require both glutamate binding and a strong depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane to open. This is because at resting potential, the channel is blocked by a magnesium ion (Mg²⁺), which is only expelled when the membrane becomes sufficiently depolarized. Once open, NMDA receptors are highly permeable to calcium ions (Ca²⁺).\n\nThe process of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a cellular model for memory, is typically induced at these synapses by a high-frequency train of presynaptic stimulation. This strong stimulation causes a large and sustained depolarization that unblocks the NMDA receptors, allowing for a significant influx of Ca²⁺, which triggers the cellular changes responsible for strengthening the synapse.\n\nIn the experiment, the neuroscientist bathes the hippocampal slice in a solution containing a novel drug. This drug is a specific antagonist that binds to and blocks NMDA receptors, preventing them from opening. The drug has no effect on AMPA receptors. After a period of incubation with the drug, the researcher delivers a high-frequency stimulation protocol that would normally be sufficient to induce LTP.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the most likely outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. The induction of LTP will be prevented because the initial depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron cannot occur.\n\nB. The induction of LTP will be prevented because the critical influx of calcium ions into the postsynaptic neuron is blocked.\n\nC. LTP will be enhanced because the blockage of NMDA receptors causes a compensatory increase in AMPA receptor activity.\n\nD. Both basal synaptic transmission and LTP induction will be completely blocked, as NMDA receptors are required for all forms of synaptic communication.\n\nE. Basal synaptic transmission will be blocked, but the induction of LTP will proceed normally.", "solution": "Principles:\n- AMPA receptors mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission by allowing $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ influx upon glutamate binding, producing a depolarizing current $I_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} \\propto g_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}(V_{m}-E_{\\mathrm{Na}})$.\n- NMDA receptors require both glutamate and sufficient depolarization to relieve $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ block; when open, they allow $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry, producing $I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} \\propto g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V_{m}-E_{\\mathrm{mixed}})$ and, critically, $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx.\n- Induction of LTP at these synapses requires a postsynaptic rise in $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration, primarily via NMDA receptors during strong depolarization.\n\nExperimental manipulation and consequences:\n1. The drug is a specific NMDA receptor antagonist. This sets $g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}=0$, so $I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}=0$ for all $V_{m}$, even during high-frequency stimulation. Therefore, NMDA receptor-mediated $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx is blocked, implying $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$ via NMDA channels is prevented.\n2. The drug has no effect on AMPA receptors. Thus, $g_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$ is unchanged, and basal synaptic transmission via $I_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$ persists.\n3. High-frequency stimulation still produces strong depolarization via AMPA currents, but without NMDA channel opening there is no corresponding NMDA-mediated $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry. Without the critical $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signal, the downstream signaling necessary for LTP induction does not occur.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because initial depolarization still occurs via AMPA receptors; only NMDA channels are blocked.\n- B is correct because LTP induction is prevented specifically due to blockade of the necessary postsynaptic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through NMDA receptors.\n- C is incorrect; blocking NMDA receptors does not enhance LTP and does not cause a compensatory acute increase in AMPA receptor activity that would substitute for the required $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signal.\n- D is incorrect; basal synaptic transmission is maintained by AMPA receptors and is not completely blocked.\n- E is incorrect; basal transmission is not blocked, whereas LTP induction is impaired.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that LTP induction is prevented because the critical $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx is blocked.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2315981"}]}
