This exercise explores what happens when that balance is disrupted, specifically by decreasing the membrane's resistance, $r_m$. Through a hypothetical scenario, you will investigate how a \"leaky\" axon impacts the passive spread of current, a concept quantified by the space constant, $\\lambda$, and ultimately affects the reliability of signal propagation [@problem_id:2296812].", "problem": "A neurobiologist is investigating the properties of a large, unmyelinated squid axon. The axon is placed in a solution that mimics its natural environment. Under normal conditions, applying a brief, suprathreshold electrical stimulus to one end of the axon generates an action potential that propagates with a constant velocity along its entire length.\n\nThe researcher then adds a novel lipid-soluble compound, named \"Poriferin,\" to the bathing solution. Poriferin molecules diffuse into the axonal membrane and spontaneously assemble into small, non-selective, ungated pores. These pores allow a passive leakage of small ions (like $Na^+$, $K^+$, and $Cl^-$) across the membrane, driven by their respective electrochemical gradients. This effect significantly decreases the overall electrical resistance of the axon's membrane. Importantly, experimental data confirms that Poriferin does not bind to or alter the structure, function, or density of the voltage-gated sodium channels or the voltage-gated potassium channels responsible for the action potential.\n\nThe same suprathreshold electrical stimulus that was used initially is applied again to the axon after it has equilibrated with the Poriferin solution.

The action potential, once initiated, may fail to propagate along the full length of the axon.\n\nE. The voltage threshold required to trigger an action potential will become more negative (i.e., the cell becomes more excitable).", "solution": "The central effect of Poriferin is that it decreases the electrical resistance of the axon's membrane by introducing new, non-selective leak channels. Let's analyze the consequences for each option based on the principles of neurophysiology.\n\nThe propagation of an action potential depends on local circuit currents. An active (depolarized) region of the axon acts as a source of current that flows longitudinally inside the axon and then exits across the membrane in adjacent, resting regions, depolarizing them. The efficiency of this process is governed by the passive cable properties of the axon. Two key parameters are the membrane resistance per unit length ($r_m$) and the axial (internal) resistance per unit length ($r_i$). These combine to define the space constant, $\\lambda = \\sqrt{r_m / r_i}$, which characterizes how far a voltage change passively spreads.\n\nPoriferin's action is to decrease $r_m$. This directly leads to a decrease in the space constant $\\lambda$.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n**A. The resting membrane potential of the axon will become exactly 0 mV.**\nThe resting potential is established by the relative permeabilities of ions, as described by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. Normally, the resting membrane is most permeable to K+, so the potential is near the K+ Nernst potential (e.g., -70 mV to -90 mV). The non-selective pores created by Poriferin increase the permeability of all ions (Na+, K+, Cl-, etc.). This will shift the resting potential to a new value that is a weighted average of the Nernst potentials of all these ions. While this new potential will be more depolarized (less negative) than the original resting potential, it is highly unlikely to be exactly 0 mV. This would only happen under very specific and coincidental conditions of ion concentrations and relative permeabilities. So, this statement is too strong and likely incorrect.\n\n**B. The conduction velocity of the action potential will increase.**\nConduction velocity in an unmyelinated axon is positively correlated with the space constant $\\lambda$. A larger space constant means that the local depolarizing currents spread further, bringing more distant regions of the axon to threshold more quickly. Since Poriferin decreases $r_m$, it decreases $\\lambda$. A smaller space constant means the current spreads less effectively, which slows down the rate at which adjacent membrane segments are brought to threshold. Therefore, the conduction velocity will *decrease*, not increase. This statement is incorrect.\n\n**C. The peak amplitude of the action potential will be larger than normal.**\nThe peak of the action potential occurs when the large influx of Na+ through voltage-gated channels begins to be balanced by an outward current. In the presence of Poriferin, the membrane is much leakier. This means that during the upstroke of the action potential, as Na+ rushes in, there will be a larger-than-normal outward leak current (e.g., K+ leaking out through Poriferin pores) that counteracts the depolarization. This increased opposing current means the membrane potential will not reach as high a positive value before the net current reverses. Thus, the peak amplitude of the action potential will *decrease*. This statement is incorrect.\n\n**D. The action potential, once initiated, may fail to propagate along the full length of the axon.**\nThis is the correct statement. Action potential propagation relies on a \"safety factor\"—the local current generated by an active patch must be greater than the minimum current required to bring the adjacent patch to threshold. As explained for option B, the decreased space constant ($\\lambda$) means that the depolarizing current from an active region dissipates more quickly and doesn't spread as far. If the membrane resistance $r_m$ is lowered sufficiently, the current reaching the adjacent segment of the axon may become too weak to depolarize it to the threshold potential. If this happens, the action potential cannot regenerate itself and propagation fails. This is a direct and highly probable consequence of a significantly \"leaky\" membrane.\n\n**E. The voltage threshold required to trigger an action potential will become more negative (i.e., the cell becomes more excitable).**\nThe voltage threshold is an intrinsic property of the voltage-gated Na+ channels. It is the membrane potential at which their activation becomes a regenerative, all-or-none process. The problem explicitly states that Poriferin does not affect these channels. Therefore, the threshold potential itself remains unchanged. Due to the increased leakiness of the membrane, a larger stimulus *current* is now required to depolarize the membrane *to* this unchanged threshold potential, meaning the axon is actually *less* excitable. A more negative threshold would imply the opposite. This statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most certain consequence is the potential failure of propagation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2296812"}, {"introduction": "Nerve signaling, while electrically efficient, is not metabolically free; maintaining the necessary ion gradients requires constant energy expenditure.
