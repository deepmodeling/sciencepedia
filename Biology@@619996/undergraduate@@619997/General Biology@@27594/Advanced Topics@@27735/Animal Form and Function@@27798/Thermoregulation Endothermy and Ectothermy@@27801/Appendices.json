The study involves a desert mouse, an endotherm, and a desert lizard, an ectotherm, both having an identical body mass, $m$. The animals are kept at rest in a controlled environment where their core body temperatures are maintained at the same value, $T = 37.0^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n\nBased on extensive empirical data, it is known that the resting metabolic rate ($RMR$) of an endotherm is significantly higher than that of an ectotherm of the same mass and at the same body temperature. For this pair of animals, the mouse's resting metabolic rate is 12 times greater than the lizard's resting metabolic rate.\n\nTo relate metabolic rate to circulatory function, make the following simplifying assumptions:\n1. The rate of oxygen consumption ($\\dot{V}O_2$) for each animal is directly proportional to its resting metabolic rate.\n2. The volume of blood ejected by the heart per beat (stroke volume) is the same for both the mouse and the lizard.\n3. The efficiency of oxygen extraction by the tissues from the blood, represented by the difference in oxygen content between arterial and venous blood, is identical for both animals at rest.\n\nBased on these principles and assumptions, which of the following options most accurately describes the expected relationship between the resting heart rate of the mouse ($HR_{mouse}$) and the resting heart rate of the lizard ($HR_{lizard}$)?\n\nA. $HR_{mouse} \\approx 6 \\cdot HR_{lizard}$\n\nB. $HR_{mouse} \\approx 12 \\cdot HR_{lizard}$\n\nC. $HR_{mouse} \\approx 144 \\cdot HR_{lizard}$\n\nD. $HR_{mouse} \\approx HR_{lizard}$\n\nE. $HR_{lizard} \\approx 12 \\cdot HR_{mouse}$", "solution": "Let the resting metabolic rate of each animal be denoted by $RMR$.
