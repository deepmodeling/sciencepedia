This process requires two distinct signals: Signal 1, provided by the T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizing a specific antigen, and Signal 2, a co-stimulatory signal. This exercise [@problem_id:2316750] explores the consequence of receiving Signal 1 without Signal 2, introducing the vital concept of anergy as a key mechanism for maintaining peripheral tolerance.", "problem": "The activation of naïve T lymphocytes is a critical control point in the adaptive immune response, requiring two distinct signals from an Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC). Signal 1 is provided by the binding of the T-Cell Receptor (TCR) to a specific peptide antigen presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on the APC surface. Signal 2, a co-stimulatory signal, is typically delivered through the interaction between the CD28 protein on the T cell and a B7 protein on the APC. This two-signal requirement serves as a safeguard to prevent inappropriate immune responses.\n\nA pharmaceutical company is developing a novel immunosuppressant drug. The drug's mechanism of action is to bind tightly to the CD28 receptor on T cells, effectively blocking its ability to interact with B7 proteins. Consider a scenario where a naïve T cell encounters an activated APC that is correctly presenting the T cell's specific cognate antigen. If this encounter occurs in the presence of a sufficient concentration of this new drug, what is the most likely immunological outcome for the T cell?\n\nA. The T cell will become fully activated, leading to clonal expansion and differentiation into effector T cells.\n\nB. The T cell will immediately undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) upon failing to receive the co-stimulatory signal.\n\nC. The T cell will enter a state of anergy, rendering it functionally unresponsive to subsequent encounters with the antigen, even with proper co-stimulation.\n\nD. The T cell will bypass the need for co-stimulation and differentiate directly into a long-lived memory T cell.\n\nE. The APC will be induced to stop presenting the antigen, effectively hiding it from the immune system.", "solution": "First, recall the two-signal model for naïve T cell activation:\n- Signal 1: Antigen-specific recognition via TCR binding to peptide–MHC on the APC.\n- Signal 2: Co-stimulation via CD28 on the T cell binding B7 molecules (CD80/CD86) on the APC.\n\nFor a naïve T cell, both signals are required to achieve full activation, clonal expansion, and differentiation. If Signal 1 occurs in the absence of Signal 2, the canonical outcome is induction of peripheral tolerance, most characteristically anergy, in which the T cell becomes functionally unresponsive to subsequent antigenic stimulation.\n\nIn the scenario described, the drug binds to CD28 on the T cell, preventing interaction with B7 on the APC. Therefore:\n- Signal 1 is present (TCR–peptide–MHC engagement).\n- Signal 2 is absent due to blockade of CD28–B7 interaction.\n\nThe established immunological consequence of Signal 1 without Signal 2 in naïve T cells is anergy. This anergic state is defined by failure to respond upon subsequent antigen encounter, and, classically, this unresponsiveness is not rescued by the provision of co-stimulation at later encounters.\n\nNow evaluate alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because full activation requires Signal 2, which is blocked.\n- B is not the most likely immediate outcome; while deletion/apoptosis can occur in some contexts, the classic immediate outcome for naïve T cells receiving Signal 1 without Signal 2 is anergy.\n- D is incorrect because co-stimulation is not bypassed to form memory; memory differentiation follows proper activation.\n- E is incorrect because the drug acts on the T cell receptor CD28, not on the APC’s antigen presentation machinery; APC presentation is unaffected.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is anergy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2316750"}, {"introduction": "Once activated, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) must find and eliminate target cells, such as those infected by a virus or cancerous cells. This recognition is highly specific, as a CTL is \"Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I restricted,\" meaning its TCR recognizes a foreign peptide only when presented by an MHC class I molecule on a target cell's surface. This practice problem [@problem_id:2316791] challenges you to apply this principle to predict the outcome of a core immunology experiment, revealing a common immune evasion tactic.", "problem": "An immunology laboratory is investigating the mechanisms of cancer cell evasion from the immune system. The researchers are working with two distinct melanoma (a type of skin cancer) cell lines derived from the same original tumor.\n\n*   **Cell Line Alpha:** This is the control cell line. It possesses a fully functional antigen presentation pathway and normally expresses Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules on its cell surface.\n*   **Cell Line Beta:** This cell line has a stable mutation that inactivates a key protein required for the transport of peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. Consequently, Cell Line Beta completely lacks MHC class I expression on its plasma membrane.\n\nBoth cell lines are cultured in separate wells. To each well, the researchers add a population of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs). These CTLs have been previously isolated and activated in a way that makes them specifically recognize a unique peptide antigen produced only by the melanoma cells when presented by an MHC class I molecule. After a 24-hour incubation period, the viability of the melanoma cells in each culture is assessed.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. High levels of cell death will be observed in the culture with Cell Line Alpha, while Cell Line Beta will remain largely viable.\n\nB. Both Cell Line Alpha and Cell Line Beta will be efficiently destroyed by the CTLs, as they both produce the target melanoma antigen.\n\nC. Cell Line Beta will be destroyed more rapidly than Cell Line Alpha, as the complete absence of MHC class I molecules serves as a primary signal for immune cell attack.\n\nD. Neither cell line will be significantly affected, suggesting that the CTLs are unable to overcome the melanoma cells' inherent defense mechanisms.", "solution": "We apply the principle of MHC restriction for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs): CTLs recognize target cells only when their T cell receptors bind a specific peptide antigen displayed in the context of MHC class I on the target cell surface. Thus, antigen production by the target cell is not sufficient; surface presentation as peptide–MHC class I is required for CTL-mediated killing.\n\nFor Cell Line Alpha, the antigen presentation pathway is intact and MHC class I molecules are expressed on the surface. Therefore:\n1. The melanoma-specific peptide is generated and loaded onto MHC class I in the endoplasmic reticulum.\n2. Peptide–MHC class I complexes reach the plasma membrane.\n3. CTLs, which are specific for this peptide–MHC class I complex, engage via their T cell receptors and CD8 coreceptors.\n4. Engagement triggers cytotoxic mechanisms (e.g., perforin/granzyme release and/or Fas–FasL interactions), leading to apoptosis of Cell Line Alpha.\nHence, we predict high levels of cell death in the culture containing Cell Line Alpha.\n\nFor Cell Line Beta, a mutation prevents transport of peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules to the surface, resulting in complete absence of MHC class I expression on the plasma membrane. Therefore:\n1. Although the melanoma antigen is produced, it is not presented on the cell surface because peptide–MHC class I complexes do not reach the membrane.\n2. CTLs cannot recognize or form stable immunological synapses without peptide–MHC class I; thus, they are not activated to kill these cells.\n3. In the conditions described, only CTLs were added; natural killer (NK) cells, which recognize missing-self (absence of MHC class I), were not added, so the lack of MHC class I does not lead to immune-mediated killing in this setup.\nHence, we predict that Cell Line Beta remains largely viable after 24 hours.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is consistent with MHC-restricted CTL killing and the provided cell line characteristics.\n- B is incorrect because antigen production without MHC class I presentation does not result in CTL recognition.\n- C is incorrect because the absence of MHC class I triggers NK cell, not CTL, responses; NK cells were not part of the experiment.\n- D is incorrect because CTLs will effectively kill Cell Line Alpha.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2316791"}, {"introduction": "Following activation, a single T cell undergoes massive clonal expansion, which demands enormous amounts of energy and biosynthetic precursors.
