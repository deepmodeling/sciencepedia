This disorder causes the podocytes, which normally wrap around the glomerular capillaries, to lose their characteristic intricate foot processes, known as pedicels. As a result, the fine filtration slits that are typically formed by the interdigitation of these pedicels are replaced by larger, less-defined gaps.

Its selectivity is governed primarily by size and charge. Small solutes and water are freely filtered; large and negatively charged macromolecules (for example, albumin) are normally restricted. Red blood cells (RBCs) are excluded predominantly by size at the level of the endothelium and GBM.\n\nThe quantitative determinants of filtration include Starling forces and the filtration coefficient. The glomerular filtration rate is\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = K_{f}\\left[(P_{\\text{GC}} - P_{\\text{BS}}) - (\\pi_{\\text{GC}} - \\pi_{\\text{BS}})\\right],\n$$\nwhere $K_{f}$ is the product of hydraulic permeability and surface area, $P_{\\text{GC}}$ is the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_{\\text{BS}}$ is the Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure, $\\pi_{\\text{GC}}$ is the oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, and $\\pi_{\\text{BS}}$ is the oncotic pressure in Bowman's space (normally negligible). Loss of slit diaphragms increases permeability; thus, if anything, $K_{f}$ would increase rather than collapse to near zero. Therefore a dramatic decrease of GFR to near zero is not the most immediate effect.\n\nThe compositional selectivity for a solute $s$ can be expressed via the sieving coefficient\n$$\n\\theta_{s} = \\frac{C_{\\text{filtrate, s}}}{C_{\\text{plasma, s}}}.\n$$\nFor small solutes such as sodium and glucose, $\\theta_{s} \\approx 1$ under normal conditions because they are freely filtered; losing slit diaphragms does not substantially change their filtration at the glomerulus, so there would not be a substantial increase in sodium concentration, nor would there be a complete absence of glucose in the filtrate (the latter is impossible at the filtration step and would only be affected by tubular reabsorption, which is stated to be unaffected).\n\nFor RBCs, $\\theta_{\\text{RBC}} \\approx 0$ because their size far exceeds the pore sizes of the endothelium and constraints of the GBM. Since the endothelium and GBM are intact, RBCs remain excluded, so the appearance of a significant quantity of RBCs in the filtrate is not the most immediate consequence.\n\nFor plasma proteins such as albumin, normal selectivity depends significantly on the slit diaphragm and negative charge barriers of the podocyte layer and GBM. Loss of podocyte foot processes and slit diaphragms increases effective pore size and reduces the selectivity against macromolecules, thereby increasing $\\theta_{\\text{albumin}}$ from near zero toward higher values. Hence, the immediate and significant consequence is a large increase in the concentration of plasma proteins (albumin) in the filtrate, that is, marked proteinuria at the filtration stage.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and significant change in the filtrate composition is a large increase in plasma proteins such as albumin.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1745958"}, {"introduction": "Building on our anatomical knowledge, we can use models to gain a deeper, quantitative understanding of renal function. By applying a simple electrical circuit analogy, we can predict how changes in vascular resistance dynamically regulate pressures and flows within the nephron. This advanced practice [@problem_id:1745929] demonstrates the power of such models, revealing the critical role of the efferent arteriole in controlling both the glomerular filtration rate and the conditions for subsequent reabsorption in peritubular capillaries.", "problem": "To model the hemodynamics of the renal microvasculature, we can use a simplified electrical circuit analogy where pressure difference acts as voltage and blood flow acts as current. Consider a model of a single nephron's blood supply as a series circuit. The circuit begins at the renal artery, which maintains a constant pressure $P_A$, and ends at the renal vein, which has a constant pressure $P_V$.\n\nThe blood flows sequentially through three resistive segments: the afferent arteriole (resistance $R_A$), the efferent arteriole (resistance $R_E$), and the peritubular/vasa recta system (resistance $R_V$). For this model, we make a key simplifying assumption: the rate of fluid loss due to glomerular filtration is considered negligible for the purpose of calculating the overall pressure drops across the resistive segments. Therefore, the blood flow rate, $Q$, can be treated as constant throughout this series circuit.\n\nThe glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_{GC}$, is the pressure at the node between $R_A$ and $R_E$. The peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_{PC}$, is the pressure at the node between $R_E$ and $R_V$. The Net Filtration Pressure ($P_{UF}$) across the glomerular capillaries is given by $P_{UF} = P_{GC} - P_{BS} - \\pi_{GC}$, where $P_{BS}$ is the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space and $\\pi_{GC}$ is the oncotic pressure of the glomerular capillary plasma.\n\nYou are given the following physiological parameters:\n- Renal artery pressure, $P_A = 100$ mmHg.\n- Renal vein pressure, $P_V = 10$ mmHg.\n- Hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space, $P_{BS} = 15$ mmHg.\n- Oncotic pressure of glomerular capillary plasma, $\\pi_{GC} = 25$ mmHg.\n- The initial resistances are related by the ratios: $R_A = R_E$ and $R_V = 0.2 R_A$.\n\nNow, suppose a physiological stressor causes a selective 50% increase in the resistance of the efferent arteriole ($R_E$), while all other parameters ($R_A$, $R_V$, $P_A$, $P_V$, $P_{BS}$, and $\\pi_{GC}$) remain unchanged.\n\nCalculate the new steady-state values for the Net Filtration Pressure ($P_{UF}$) and the Peritubular Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure ($P_{PC}$), in that order.

In this analogy, pressure ($P$) is equivalent to voltage ($V$), blood flow ($Q$) is equivalent to current ($I$), and vascular resistance ($R$) is equivalent to electrical resistance ($R$). The fundamental relationship is Ohm's Law, which in this context is $\\Delta P = Q \\cdot R$.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the initial and final resistance values.**\nLet's define a base resistance unit $R$ such that the initial afferent resistance $R_A = R$.\nBased on the given ratios, the initial efferent resistance is $R_E = R_A = R$, and the initial venous resistance is $R_V = 0.2 R_A = 0.2 R$.\n\nThe problem states that the efferent arteriole resistance increases by 50%. Let the new state be denoted by a prime symbol (').\nThe new efferent resistance is $R_E' = R_E + 0.50 R_E = 1.5 R_E = 1.5 R$.\nThe other resistances remain unchanged: $R_A' = R_A = R$ and $R_V' = R_V = 0.2 R$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total resistance and blood flow for the final state.**\nThe total resistance of the series circuit is the sum of the individual resistances.\n$$R'_{\\text{total}} = R_A' + R_E' + R_V' = R + 1.5 R + 0.2 R = 2.7 R$$\nThe total pressure drop across the circuit is $\\Delta P_{\\text{total}} = P_A - P_V$.\nThe new blood flow, $Q'$, is given by Ohm's law:\n$$Q' = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{total}}}{R'_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{P_A - P_V}{2.7 R} = \\frac{100 \\text{ mmHg} - 10 \\text{ mmHg}}{2.7 R} = \\frac{90}{2.7 R}$$\nNotice that the flow $Q'$ is inversely proportional to the arbitrary resistance unit $R$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the new Peritubular Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure ($P_{PC}'$).**\nThe peritubular capillary pressure ($P_{PC}'$) is the pressure at the node between $R_E'$ and $R_V'$.
