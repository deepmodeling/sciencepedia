The sediment is hypoxic, meaning the partial pressure of oxygen in the surrounding water is very low. This organism breathes through its skin, which is perfused by a dense network of capillaries. A gentle, continuous current of water flows over the animal's body surface from its anterior (head) to its posterior (tail) end.

These definitions imply that a small change in oxygen partial pressure corresponds to a convective oxygen content change $G\\,dP$ in each stream.\n\nCocurrent model (A): Both streams flow in the $+x$ direction, entering at $x=0$ with $P_{w}(0)=P_{O_{2},\\text{water,in}}$ and $P_{b}(0)=P_{O_{2},\\text{blood,in}}$.

A standard and exact way to compare outlet performance for fixed $G_{w},G_{b}$ and total transfer conductance $U A$ (the integral of $M$ over length) is to use the two-stream exchanger effectiveness.
