Robust fossil evidence establishes that the two species diverged from a common ancestor at a time $T_\\text{fossil} = 7.0$ million years ago (Mya).\n\nTo corroborate this finding, the scientist sequences a specific non-coding region of the nuclear genome from individuals of both species. This genetic locus is assumed to be evolving neutrally.

The scientist hypothesizes that this discrepancy is caused by the persistence of ancestral genetic polymorphism through the speciation event, a phenomenon known as incomplete lineage sorting. In this model, the total time separating the two gene copies ($T_\\text{gene}$) is the sum of the time since species divergence ($T_\\text{fossil}$) and an additional \"waiting time\" ($T_\\text{wait}$) for the gene copies to find a common ancestor within the ancestral population.
