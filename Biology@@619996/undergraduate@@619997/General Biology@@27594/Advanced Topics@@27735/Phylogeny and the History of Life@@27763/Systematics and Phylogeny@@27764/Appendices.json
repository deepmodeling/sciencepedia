Mastering this skill is essential for accurately interpreting any phylogenetic hypothesis.", "problem": "A biologist is studying the evolutionary relationships among four hypothetical species of nocturnal mammals: the Lunara, the Noctule, the Umbral, and the Gloomfang. Based on a comprehensive genetic analysis, a phylogenetic tree is constructed. The branching pattern, or topology, of the tree is as follows: The lineage leading to the Lunara is the first to diverge from the common ancestor of all four species. Following this, the lineage leading to the Noctule diverges. Finally, the remaining lineage splits to form the Umbral and the Gloomfang, which are sister taxa (each other's closest relatives).\n\nA student is shown a diagram representing this tree where the species at the tips are arranged from left to right in the order: Lunara, Noctule, Umbral, Gloomfang. The student makes several statements after observing this specific arrangement. Which of the following statements represents a valid conclusion that can be drawn from the described evolutionary relationships, independent of the diagram's arbitrary layout?\n\nA. The Gloomfang is the most evolutionarily advanced species because its position is at the far right of the diagram.\n\nB.

The amount of evolutionary change that occurred in the lineage leading to the Noctule is greater than the change that occurred in the lineage leading to the Umbral.\n\nE. The Noctule is a direct ancestor of the Umbral.", "solution": "We interpret the phylogenetic information as follows: the topology specifies that the Lunara diverged first from the common ancestor of all four species, then the Noctule diverged, and finally the remaining lineage split into the Umbral and the Gloomfang, which are sister taxa. In phylogenetics, the key principles are: (i) tree topology determines relative relatedness via the recency of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA); (ii) the left-to-right order of tips is arbitrary and does not imply degree of advancement, primitiveness, or amount of change; (iii) without calibrated branch lengths, one cannot infer rates or amounts of evolutionary change; and (iv) in a standard cladogram of extant species, tips represent contemporaneous taxa, not direct ancestors of other tips.\n\nApplying these principles: Statement A is invalid because the position at the far right is an arbitrary layout and does not indicate being more advanced; there is no objective measure of being “most evolutionarily advanced” derived from tip order. Statement B is invalid because “first to diverge” does not mean “most primitive”; all extant species have continued evolving since their divergence. Statement C is valid because the Umbral and the Gloomfang are sister taxa, meaning they share a more recent common ancestor with each other than with the Noctule; thus, the Umbral is more closely related to the Gloomfang than to the Noctule. Statement D is invalid because the topology alone (without branch lengths or explicit measures of change) cannot support a conclusion about the amount of evolutionary change on the Noctule lineage versus the Umbral lineage. Statement E is invalid because the Noctule and the Umbral are both tips and neither is the direct ancestor of the other; they share an ancestor.\n\nTherefore, the only valid conclusion that is independent of the diagram’s arbitrary layout is that the Umbral is more closely related to the Gloomfang than to the Noctule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2316573"}, {"introduction": "After learning to read a tree, the next step is to understand how they are constructed from data.

This problem [@problem_id:2316551] explores a classic scenario where a simpler method (maximum parsimony) and a more complex statistical method (maximum likelihood) disagree. By analyzing the case, you will uncover the phenomenon of \"long-branch attraction,\" a common pitfall in phylogenetic reconstruction, and appreciate why model-based approaches are crucial for handling complex evolutionary patterns.", "problem": "A molecular systematist is investigating the evolutionary relationships among four species of bioluminescent fungi: *Mycena luxaeterna* (A), *Panellus stipticus* (B), *Armillaria mellea* (C), and an outgroup species, *Omphalotus olearius* (D). The researcher sequences a highly conserved region of a ribosomal RNA gene and also a rapidly evolving mitochondrial gene for all four species. After aligning the sequences for the mitochondrial gene, she performs two separate phylogenetic analyses.\n\nThe first analysis, using the principle of maximum parsimony (MP), yields a single, most-parsimonious tree with the topology (C, (A, B)), which groups species A and B as a sister clade.\n\nThe second analysis, using maximum likelihood (ML) with a GTR+I+G model (General Time Reversible model with a proportion of invariant sites and gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity), robustly recovers a different topology: (B, (A, C)), which groups species A and C as a sister clade.\n\nUpon examining the branch lengths of the ML tree, the researcher notes that the terminal branches leading to species A and B are significantly longer than the branches leading to C and D. Which of the following statements provides the most likely and fundamental explanation for the discrepancy between the two results?\n\nA. The maximum likelihood method is overfitting the data with too many parameters in the GTR+I+G model, causing it to incorrectly group the slowly evolving lineages A and C. Parsimony, being simpler, is more likely to be correct.\n\nB. The conflict is a result of incomplete lineage sorting in the mitochondrial gene, a phenomenon that maximum parsimony is designed to detect while maximum likelihood is not.\n\nC. The maximum likelihood analysis, by using a complex model, is incorrectly separating the two rapidly evolving lineages A and B, which parsimony correctly identified as a clade.\n\nD. The maximum parsimony analysis is likely being misled by long-branch attraction. The two long branches leading to species A and B indicate rapid evolution, which can create convergent substitutions (homoplasies). Parsimony, aiming only to minimize the number of steps, incorrectly interprets these homoplasies as shared derived characters and artifactually groups the long branches A and B together. The model-based ML method is better equipped to handle this rate variation and is more likely to have recovered the true topology.", "solution": "We interpret the setup: two phylogenetic methods applied to the same mitochondrial alignment produce conflicting topologies. Maximum parsimony (MP) yields (C,(A,B)), while maximum likelihood (ML) under a GTR+I+G model recovers (B,(A,C)). Inspection of the ML estimate shows long terminal branches to taxa A and B, and shorter branches to C and D (the outgroup).\n\nKey principle 1: Long-branch attraction (LBA). When two lineages have high substitution rates (long branches), they independently accumulate many multiple and convergent substitutions (homoplasies). Maximum parsimony, which minimizes total steps without an explicit substitution model, is statistically inconsistent in the so-called Felsenstein zone and can be misled to group long branches together because it misinterprets convergent similarities as shared derived states (synapomorphies).\n\nKey principle 2: Model-based methods such as ML with a realistic substitution model (e.g., GTR) and rate heterogeneity (I and G) can down-weight rapidly changing sites and account for multiple hits, making them much more robust to LBA.\n\nApplying these principles: The observation that species A and B have long branches, while C and the outgroup D have short branches, strongly suggests a classic LBA situation. Parsimony is prone to incorrectly grouping long branches together, so it is likely that parsimony artifactually grouped A and B. This matches the stated result for the MP analysis. In contrast, ML with GTR+I+G is expected to better handle rate variation across sites and across lineages, so its recovery of (B,(A,C)) is more consistent with avoiding the LBA artifact and recovering the true tree.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect. The GTR+I+G model is specifically designed to handle the kind of rate heterogeneity suggested by the long branches. It is far more probable that parsimony is failing than that the model is overfitting in this classic scenario.\n- B is incorrect. Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) is a different biological phenomenon and is not the most direct explanation for a conflict between MP and ML specifically linked to rate heterogeneity (long branches).\n- C is incorrect because it posits that the simpler method (parsimony) is correct and the model-based method is wrong, which is the opposite of what is expected in an LBA scenario.\n- D correctly identifies LBA as the cause, explains that rapidly evolving A and B generate many homoplasies that parsimony misreads as synapomorphies, artifactually grouping them, and correctly concludes that the model-based ML method is more likely to be correct.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and fundamental explanation for the discrepancy is that MP is being misled by long-branch attraction involving A and B, whereas ML with GTR+I+G is robust to that bias.
