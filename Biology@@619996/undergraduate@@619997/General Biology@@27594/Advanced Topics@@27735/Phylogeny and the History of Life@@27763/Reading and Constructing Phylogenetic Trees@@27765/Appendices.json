A related, more primitive species, the Proto-Form, is used as the outgroup to root the phylogenetic tree. The biologist has identified four distinct binary traits among these species: the presence of bioluminescence, armored plates, a sonic burst ability, and the ability to spit acid.\n\nThe presence or absence of these traits for each species is recorded in the following character matrix, where `1` indicates the presence of the trait (derived state) and `0` indicates its absence (ancestral state).\n\n*   **Proto-Form (Outgroup):** Bioluminescence (0), Armored Plates (0), Sonic Burst (0), Acid Spit (0)\n*   **Gloomfang:** Bioluminescence (1), Armored Plates (0), Sonic Burst (1), Acid Spit (1)\n*   **Skyscreecher:** Bioluminescence (1), Armored Plates (0), Sonic Burst (1), Acid Spit (0)\n*   **Shard-Wyrm:** Bioluminescence (0), Armored Plates (1), Sonic Burst (1), Acid Spit (1)\n*   **Terra-Titan:** Bioluminescence (0), Armored Plates (1), Sonic Burst (1), Acid Spit (0)\n\nYour task is to determine the most plausible evolutionary tree based on the principle of maximum parsimony.

For the character where all ingroup taxa share state $1$ and the outgroup is $0$, the minimal length is $1$ on any tree (one change on the ingroup stem).\n\nThe three characters with two $1$s each are:\n- Bioluminescence: $1$ in $\\{G,S\\}$ (favors clade $\\{G,S\\}$).\n- Armored plates: $1$ in $\\{W,T\\}$ (favors clade $\\{W,T\\}$).\n- Acid spit: $1$ in $\\{G,W\\}$ (favors clade $\\{G,W\\}$).\n\nThese three favored splits are mutually incompatible in the sense that no binary tree can simultaneously contain all three; however, a tree can contain the two compatible splits $\\{G,S\\}$ and $\\{W,T\\}$, but then it necessarily excludes $\\{G,W\\}$.

To understand its origins, the biologist has reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among eight hypothetical insect species based on extensive genetic data. The relationships are described as follows:\n\nThe phylogeny has a single common ancestor for all eight species. This ancestor gave rise to two primary lineages.\n- The first primary lineage leads directly to a single species, *Mantis solus*.\n- The second primary lineage leads to a large clade containing the other seven species. The most recent common ancestor of this clade gave rise to two secondary lineages.\n  - The first secondary lineage contains species related to modern cockroaches and termites. It subsequently splits into two terminal branches, one leading to *Blatta quies* and the other to *Termes structor*.\n  - The second secondary lineage is the Hymenoptera clade (species related to wasps, bees, and ants). Its most recent common ancestor gave rise to two tertiary lineages.\n    - The first tertiary lineage leads directly to the species *Vespa solitaria*.\n    - The second tertiary lineage contains species related to bees and ants. Its most recent common ancestor gave rise to two smaller clades.\n      - The first of these smaller clades contains two bee-related species, *Apis individualis* and *Apis communa*, which are each other's closest relatives.\n      - The second of these smaller clades contains two ant-related species, *Formica laborans* and *Myrmica rubra*, which are also each other's closest relatives.\n\nAfter studying the behavior and life history of these species, the biologist determined the presence or absence of eusociality in each:\n- Eusocial species: *Termes structor*, *Apis communa*, *Formica laborans*, *Myrmica rubra*.\n- Non-eusocial (solitary) species: *Mantis solus*, *Blatta quies*, *Vespa solitaria*, *Apis individualis*.\n\nUsing the principle of maximum parsimony, determine the minimum number of independent evolutionary events (either gains or losses of the trait) required to explain the observed distribution of eusociality across these eight species.", "solution": "Encode eusociality as a binary character with state $1$ for presence and $0$ for absence.

This exercise explores such a case of \"gene tree-species tree\" discordance, guiding you toward a common and powerful explanation: a gene duplication event deep in evolutionary time [@problem_id:2311367]. Resolving this conflict is key to correctly interpreting genomic data and understanding how new genes, and thus new functions, arise.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying a newly characterized gene family, which she names \"Adaptin,\" in three vertebrate species: a human (*Homo sapiens*), a mouse (*Mus musculus*), and a zebrafish (*Danio rerio*). Her genomic analysis identifies two distinct members of this family in humans, designated *Adaptin-alpha* and *Adaptin-gamma*, but only one orthologous gene in the mouse and zebrafish, which she designates *Adaptin-gamma*.\n\nTo understand the evolutionary history of this gene family, she performs a multiple sequence alignment of the protein products and constructs a phylogenetic tree. The resulting gene tree topology robustly shows that the human *Adaptin-gamma* protein is more closely related to the mouse *Adaptin-gamma* protein than it is to the human *Adaptin-alpha* protein. This finding appears to contradict the well-established species phylogeny, where humans are, as a species, more closely related to other genes in their own genome than to any gene in a mouse.\n\nGiven the well-established species tree where the human-mouse divergence is much more recent than the mammal-fish divergence, which of the following statements provides the most parsimonious and accurate evolutionary explanation for the observed gene tree?\n\nA. The *Adaptin-alpha* gene was transferred horizontally from a distant, unknown species into the human lineage after the human-mouse split.\nB. Incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral *Adaptin* alleles has led to the human lineage retaining an allele that is by chance more similar to the allele that became fixed in the mouse lineage.\nC. A gene duplication event giving rise to the *Adaptin-alpha* and *Adaptin-gamma* lineages occurred in a common ancestor of mammals, before the divergence of humans and mice.\nD. The mouse *Adaptin-gamma* and human *Adaptin-gamma* genes are a result of convergent evolution driven by similar selective pressures in mammals, making them appear more closely related than they truly are.\nE. The human *Adaptin-alpha* gene has experienced an extremely high rate of mutation, causing it to artificially appear as an outgroup to the human-gamma and mouse-gamma clade.", "solution": "First, distinguish species trees from gene trees. A species tree orders speciation events among species, whereas a gene tree reflects the history of gene copies, which can include gene duplication and loss. Two homologous genes can be related as orthologs (separated by a speciation) or as paralogs (separated by a duplication). Thus, it is entirely possible for a human gene to be more closely related to a mouse ortholog than to another human paralog if the latter diverged earlier via duplication.\n\nApply these definitions to the observation. The gene tree shows that human Adaptin-gamma clusters with mouse Adaptin-gamma more closely than with human Adaptin-alpha. The most direct interpretation is that human Adaptin-gamma and mouse Adaptin-gamma are orthologs, while human Adaptin-alpha is a paralog that split from the gamma lineage at an earlier duplication event.\n\nNext, reconcile this with the presence-absence pattern across species: humans have two copies (alpha and gamma), mouse has one (gamma), and zebrafish has one (gamma). The well-established species tree has the fish-mammal split occurring before the human-mouse split. Therefore, to place human gamma with mouse gamma as orthologs while human alpha is an earlier-diverging paralog, the duplication that produced the alpha and gamma lineages must have occurred before the human-mouse divergence. Otherwise, if the duplication were after the human-mouse split (in the human lineage), the two human copies would be sister paralogs and would group together, contradicting the observed tree. Because zebrafish has only one copy, the duplication is most parsimoniously placed in the mammalian lineage after the fish-mammal split. The absence of Adaptin-alpha in mouse is then explained by a single gene loss in the mouse lineage. This scenario requires one duplication (in the mammalian ancestor) plus one loss (in mouse), fits the observed topology (gamma-human clustering with gamma-mouse), and matches the species divergence order.\n\nEvaluate each proposed explanation:\n\n- A (horizontal gene transfer into humans) is highly implausible in vertebrate nuclear genomes and would require an extra, rare event that does not naturally explain the observed orthology of the gamma genes; it is not parsimonious.\n\n- B (incomplete lineage sorting) operates on alleles at a single locus and cannot produce an extra gene copy in humans. It cannot explain the presence of two genes in humans and one in mouse.\n\n- C (duplication before human-mouse divergence) naturally yields human gamma and mouse gamma as orthologs and human alpha as a paralog, with zebrafish retaining a single pre-duplication copy. The missing mouse alpha is explained by a single loss. This is the most parsimonious and accurate explanation.\n\n- D (convergent evolution) would require extensive, repeated sequence convergence across many sites to recreate the observed robust clustering and is not parsimonious relative to a single duplication plus a single loss.\n\n- E (extreme rate increase in human alpha) would not by itself explain the presence/absence pattern or produce robust support for the gamma-gamma clade; moreover, even with rate heterogeneity, a duplication is still required to explain two human copies.\n\nTherefore, the most parsimonious and accurate explanation is that a gene duplication generating the alpha and gamma lineages occurred in a mammalian ancestor before the human-mouse divergence, followed by loss of the alpha copy in the mouse lineage, consistent with option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2311367"}]}
