The biologist uses the presence or absence of four key morphological and reproductive traits to build a phylogeny. The Green Algae is determined to be the outgroup, representing the ancestral state for all characters.\n\nThe observed traits are as follows:\n-   **Trait 1 (Protected Embryo):** All organisms in the study possess a protected embryo during their life cycle, with the sole exception of the Green Algae.\n-   **Trait 2 (Vascular Tissue):** True vascular tissue (xylem and phloem) is found in the Fern, the Pine Tree, and the Sunflower.

A monophyletic group includes a common ancestor and all of its descendants. We will use the provided character data and the principle of parsimony to construct a cladogram (a phylogenetic tree).\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Character Distribution**\n\nWe can summarize the presence (+) or absence (-) of the four traits for each organism. The Green Algae is the outgroup, meaning it is assumed to have the ancestral state (-) for all derived characters.\n\n-   **Green Algae:** -, -, -, -\n-   **Moss:** +, -, -, -\n-   **Fern:** +, +, -, -\n-   **Pine Tree:** +, +, +, -\n-   **Sunflower:** +, +, +, +\n\n**Step 2: Construct the Cladogram based on Shared Derived Characters (Synapomorphies)**\n\nWe build the tree by grouping organisms based on the characters they share, starting from the most inclusive trait.\n\n-   **Rooting the Tree:** The Green Algae is the outgroup. It lacks all the derived traits, so it branches off first from the common ancestor of the entire group.\n\n-   **Trait 1 (Protected Embryo):** This trait is present in all other organisms (Moss, Fern, Pine Tree, Sunflower). This is a shared derived character that unites these four into a monophyletic group, the land plants (Embryophytes). The appearance of the protected embryo is the first evolutionary event after the divergence from the Green Algae lineage.\n\n-   **Trait 2 (Vascular Tissue):** This trait is present in the Fern, Pine Tree, and Sunflower. Within the land plant group, the Moss lacks this trait. Therefore, the Moss lineage must have diverged after the evolution of the protected embryo but before the evolution of vascular tissue. The remaining three organisms (Fern, Pine, Sunflower) form a smaller, nested monophyletic group, the vascular plants (Tracheophytes), defined by the shared derived character of vascular tissue.\n\n-   **Trait 3 (Seeds):** This trait is present only in the Pine Tree and the Sunflower. Within the vascular plant group, the Fern lacks seeds. This means the Fern lineage diverged after the evolution of vascular tissue but before the evolution of seeds. The Pine Tree and Sunflower form an even smaller monophyletic group, the seed plants (Spermatophytes), defined by the shared derived character of seeds.\n\n-   **Trait 4 (Flowers):** This trait is present only in the Sunflower. Within the seed plant group, the Pine Tree lacks flowers. This means the Pine Tree and Sunflower share a common ancestor that had seeds, and after their lineages diverged, flowers evolved in the lineage leading to the Sunflower.\n\nThis results in the following nested structure of clades: (Moss, (Fern, (Pine Tree, Sunflower))). The cladogram can be visualized as:\n```\n      +-- Green Algae\n      |\n(Trait 1: Protected Embryo)\n      +--+-- Moss\n         |\n    (Trait 2: Vascular Tissue)\n         +--+-- Fern\n            |\n          (Trait 3: Seeds)\n            +--+-- Pine Tree\n               |\n             (Trait 4: Flowers)\n               +-- Sunflower\n```\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options**\n\nNow we evaluate each option to see if it represents a monophyletic group based on our derived cladogram. A monophyletic group must contain a common ancestor and ALL of its descendants.\n\n-   **A. Moss and Fern:** This is not a monophyletic group. The most recent common ancestor of Moss and Fern is also the ancestor of the Pine Tree and Sunflower. Since this group excludes the Pine Tree and Sunflower, it is paraphyletic.\n\n-   **B. Green Algae and Moss:** This is not a monophyletic group. The most recent common ancestor of Green Algae and Moss is the ancestor of all five organisms. Since this group excludes the Fern, Pine Tree, and Sunflower, it is paraphyletic.\n\n-   **C. Fern, Pine Tree, and Sunflower:** This is a monophyletic group. It includes the common ancestor that first evolved vascular tissue and all of its descendants listed in this problem (Fern, Pine Tree, and Sunflower). This group corresponds to the Tracheophytes (vascular plants).\n\n-   **D. Moss, Fern, and Pine Tree:** This is not a monophyletic group. The most recent common ancestor of these three is the ancestor of all the land plants in the group. However, it omits the Sunflower, which is more closely related to the Pine Tree than either is to the Moss or Fern. The group is paraphyletic.\n\n-   **E. Green Algae, Moss, and Fern:** This is not a monophyletic group. The most recent common ancestor of these organisms is the ancestor of all five aorganisms. This group excludes the seed plants (Pine Tree and Sunflower), making it paraphyletic.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option C describes a valid monophyletic group.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2286843"}, {"introduction": "Once a cladogram is proposed, how do we evaluate its strength against other possibilities?

The principle of parsimony favors the hypothesis that requires the fewest evolutionary events (in this case, nucleotide mutations) to explain the observed character states.\n\nFirst, let's identify the character states from the provided DNA sequence data for the specific nucleotide position. The ancestral state is the one found in the outgroup, *Geovermis superficialis*. The derived state is any other state.\n\n- Ancestral character state (from *Geovermis superficialis*): G\n- Derived character state: C\n\nThe character states for the ingroup species are:\n- *Luminaphis abyssalis*: C (derived)\n- *Noctivermis profundus*: C (derived)\n- *Umbramermis hadalis*: G (ancestral)\n\nNow, we will map these character states onto each proposed tree and count the minimum number of mutations required to explain the distribution of states.\n\n**Analysis of Hypothesis 1 (Tree A):**\nIn this tree, *Luminaphis abyssalis* and *Noctivermis profundus* form a clade (they are sister taxa).\nThe structure is: ((Luminaphis, Noctivermis), Umbramermis).\n\n1.  The outgroup and *Umbramermis hadalis* both have the ancestral state 'G'.\n2.  *Luminaphis abyssalis* and *Noctivermis profundus* both have the derived state 'C'.\n3.  We can explain this pattern by postulating a single evolutionary change. The common ancestor of all three ingroup species had the state 'G'. Then, a single mutation from G to C occurred on the branch leading to the common ancestor of *Luminaphis abyssalis* and *Noctivermis profundus*. Both species then inherited this derived 'C' state.\n4.  This scenario requires a total of **1** evolutionary change. The shared derived character 'C' is a synapomorphy for the (*Luminaphis*, *Noctivermis*) clade.\n\n**Analysis of Hypothesis 2 (Tree B):**\nIn this tree, *Noctivermis profundus* and *Umbramermis hadalis* form a clade.\nThe structure is: ((Noctivermis, Umbramermis), Luminaphis).\n\n1.  The proposed sister taxa, *Noctivermis profundus* and *Umbramermis hadalis*, have different states ('C' and 'G', respectively).\n2.  *Luminaphis abyssalis* has the state 'C'.\n3.  To explain this pattern, we must consider two possibilities, both of which are less parsimonious than the scenario in Tree A.\n    *   **Possibility 1 (Convergent Evolution):** The common ancestor of all three ingroup species retained the ancestral state 'G'. A mutation from G to C then occurred independently on the branch leading to *Luminaphis abyssalis* and on the branch leading to *Noctivermis profundus*. This would require **2** evolutionary changes. The presence of 'C' in these two species would be a homoplasy (an analogous trait).\n    *   **Possibility 2 (Change and Reversal):** The mutation from G to C occurred on the branch leading to the common ancestor of all three ingroup species. *Luminaphis abyssalis* and the common ancestor of (*Noctivermis*, *Umbramermis*) would inherit 'C'. Then, a second mutation, a reversal from C back to G, would have to occur on the branch leading to *Umbramermis hadalis*. This also requires a total of **2** evolutionary changes.\n\nIn either case, the minimum number of changes required to explain the data on Tree B is **2**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Tree A requires 1 evolutionary change.\n- Tree B requires 2 evolutionary changes.\n\nSince Tree A requires fewer changes, it is the more parsimonious hypothesis.

This practice [@problem_id:2286871] uses an engaging, non-biological analogy of smartphone evolution to explore how biologists handle such conflicting data. By mapping features onto a known family tree, you will see how parsimony helps distinguish between a shared derived character (a synapomorphy) and a case of homoplasy—a character distribution that requires a more complex explanation, such as convergent evolution or secondary loss.", "problem": "A technology historian is studying the evolution of four smartphone models from a single company: the ChronosX (the oldest model), the Pulsar S, the Nova 5, and the Zenith Pro (the most recent). The historian has constructed a family tree representing the developmental relationships between these models.

The last branching event separated the lineages that became the Nova 5 and the Zenith Pro. This can be represented textually as (ChronosX, (Pulsar S, (Nova 5, Zenith Pro))).\n\nThe presence (1) or absence (0) of four key innovative features is recorded for each model:\n- **ChronosX:** Lacks all four features. Its state is (Edge-to-Edge Display: 0, Wireless Charging: 0, Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) Screen: 0, Water Resistance: 0).\n- **Pulsar S:** Has an Edge-to-Edge Display and Water Resistance.

The principle of parsimony dictates that we should prefer the explanation that hypothesizes the minimum number of evolutionary events (gains or losses of a trait).\n\nThe tree structure is given as (ChronosX, (Pulsar S, (Nova 5, Zenith Pro))). This means ChronosX is the outgroup. Pulsar S is the sister taxon to the clade containing Nova 5 and Zenith Pro. Nova 5 and Zenith Pro are sister taxa, meaning they share an immediate common ancestor not shared by any other model. The ancestral state for all features is absent (0), as shown by the outgroup, ChronosX.\n\nLet's analyze each feature separately.\n\n**1. Analysis of 'Wireless Charging'**\n\n-   **Data:**\n    -   ChronosX: 0 (Absent)\n    -   Pulsar S: 0 (Absent)\n    -   Nova 5: 1 (Present)\n    -   Zenith Pro: 1 (Present)\n\n-   **Mapping onto the tree:** The feature is present only in Nova 5 and Zenith Pro. Since these two models are sister taxa, they form a monophyletic group (a clade). The most parsimonious explanation is that 'Wireless Charging' was gained a single time in their common ancestor. This single gain event on the branch leading to the (Nova 5, Zenith Pro) clade perfectly explains its presence in both descendant models and its absence in all others.\n\n-   **Conclusion for Wireless Charging:** This requires exactly **1 evolutionary event** (a single gain).\n\n**2. Analysis of 'Water Resistance'**\n\n-   **Data:**\n    -   ChronosX: 0 (Absent)\n    -   Pulsar S: 1 (Present)\n    -   Nova 5: 0 (Absent)\n    -   Zenith Pro: 1 (Present)\n\n-   **Mapping onto the tree:** The feature is present in Pulsar S and Zenith Pro. These two models are not sister taxa; their group is paraphyletic because it excludes Nova 5, which is more closely related to Zenith Pro than Pulsar S is. Therefore, a single gain event cannot explain this distribution. We must consider two possibilities:\n\n    -   **Hypothesis A: Convergent Evolution (Two Gains).** 'Water Resistance' was gained independently on two separate branches: once on the terminal branch leading to Pulsar S, and a second time on the terminal branch leading to Zenith Pro. This scenario requires **2 evolutionary events** (two gains).\n\n    -   **Hypothesis B: Gain and Subsequent Loss (One Gain, One Loss).** 'Water Resistance' was gained once, earlier in the tree, at the common ancestor of the (Pulsar S, (Nova 5, Zenith Pro)) clade. This would mean all three models should inherit it. To account for its absence in Nova 5, we must then hypothesize a secondary loss of the feature on the terminal branch leading to Nova 5. This scenario also requires **2 evolutionary events** (one gain and one loss).\n\n-   **Conclusion for Water Resistance:** Both plausible scenarios require a minimum of **2 evolutionary events**. Therefore, the most parsimonious explanation for the distribution of 'Water Resistance' involves two changes.\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\n\n-   **A. Wireless Charging was gained once. Water Resistance requires a minimum of two separate events (either two independent gains or one gain followed by one loss).** This statement perfectly matches our analysis. Wireless Charging requires 1 step, and Water Resistance requires a minimum of 2 steps. This is the correct choice.\n\n-   **B. Water Resistance was gained once. Wireless Charging requires a minimum of two separate events...** This reverses the findings. Incorrect.\n\n-   **C. Both Wireless Charging and Water Resistance were each gained once...** This is incorrect because Water Resistance requires two events.\n\n-   **D. Both Wireless Charging and Water Resistance were gained twice independently...** This is incorrect because Wireless Charging only requires one event.\n\n-   **E. Wireless Charging was gained at the common ancestor of Pulsar S, Nova 5, and Zenith Pro, and was then lost in the Pulsar S lineage...** This is a non-parsimonious explanation for Wireless Charging (1 gain + 1 loss = 2 steps, versus the 1-step alternative). This part of the statement is incorrect. The part about Water Resistance is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that accurately describes the most parsimonious history is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2286871"}]}
