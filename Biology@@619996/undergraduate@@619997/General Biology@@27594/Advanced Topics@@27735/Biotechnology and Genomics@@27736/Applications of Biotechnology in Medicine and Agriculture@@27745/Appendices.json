However, their widespread use creates powerful selective pressures in the environment. This first practice problem [@problem_id:2280035] asks you to diagnose a common challenge in the field—the emergence of resistant weeds—by applying the fundamental principles of evolution by natural selection.", "problem": "A farmer has successfully cultivated genetically modified (GM) soybeans for several years. These soybeans contain a gene that makes them resistant to glyphosate, a broad-spectrum herbicide. This practice allows the farmer to spray the entire field with glyphosate, effectively killing most weeds without harming the soybean crop. However, in the most recent growing season, the farmer observes that a particular species of weed is now flourishing throughout the field, even after repeated applications of glyphosate at the recommended concentration.\n\nAssuming the glyphosate product has not changed and is being applied correctly, which of the following statements provides the most scientifically accurate evolutionary explanation for the observation of glyphosate-resistant weeds?\n\nA. Constant exposure to glyphosate caused specific, directed mutations in the weeds' DNA, granting them resistance, which was then passed on to their offspring.\n\nB. The GM soybeans are transferring their resistance gene to the local weed population through a process called horizontal gene transfer, creating a new resistant weed species.\n\nC. Some individual weeds in the original population, by chance, already possessed genetic mutations that conferred a degree of resistance to glyphosate. The herbicide application eliminated susceptible individuals, allowing the pre-existing resistant ones to survive and reproduce.\n\nD. Individual weeds, upon being exposed to non-lethal doses of glyphosate, developed physiological adaptations to tolerate the chemical within their own lifetime and passed these acquired characteristics to their progeny.\n\nE. The weeds have developed an \"immunity\" to the herbicide over time, similar to how an animal's immune system develops memory cells after an infection, allowing them to rapidly neutralize the chemical.", "solution": "We begin by applying the core principles of evolution by natural selection: (i) individuals in a population vary in heritable traits, (ii) these traits affect survival and reproduction in a given environment, and (iii) over generations, alleles that enhance survival and reproduction increase in frequency. In a weed population exposed to glyphosate, the herbicide imposes a strong selection pressure favoring any pre-existing genetic variants that reduce susceptibility.\n\nLet $R$ denote an allele that confers resistance and $S$ an allele that does not. If the initial frequency of $R$ is $p$ and of $S$ is $q=1-p$, and the relative fitnesses satisfy $w_{R}>w_{S}$ under glyphosate exposure, then standard population genetics shows that the frequency of $R$ increases after selection according to\n$$\n\\Delta p=\\frac{p q \\left(w_{R}-w_{S}\\right)}{\\bar{w}},\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{w}=p w_{R}+q w_{S}$ is the mean fitness. This formalism captures the intuitive outcome: repeated herbicide applications eliminate susceptible genotypes and enrich resistant ones that were already present by chance.\n\nWe now evaluate the options in light of these principles:\n- Option A claims directed mutation caused by glyphosate. This is incorrect because mutation is stochastic with respect to need; environments do not induce specific, adaptive mutations.\n- Option B attributes the observation to horizontal gene transfer from GM soybeans. In plants, gene flow typically occurs via sexual hybridization (vertical transmission), which requires reproductive compatibility; horizontal gene transfer across plant species is exceedingly rare and not a general explanation for field-evolved herbicide resistance.\n- Option C states that some weeds already carried resistance-conferring mutations by chance, and selection by glyphosate increased their representation. This matches the standard natural selection framework above and is the canonical evolutionary explanation for resistance evolution.\n- Option D asserts that individual weeds acquired tolerance physiologically and inherited it. This is a Lamarckian mechanism and is not supported as a general, heritable basis for population-level resistance.\n- Option E incorrectly analogizes herbicide resistance to adaptive immunity; plants do not possess an adaptive immune system, and herbicide resistance is not an immunological memory phenomenon.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically accurate evolutionary explanation is that pre-existing genetic variation for resistance was present, and selection by glyphosate increased the frequency of those resistant individuals, as described in Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2280035"}, {"introduction": "As biotechnology advances, we move towards increasingly precise tools like RNA interference ($RNAi$) to combat pathogens in both medicine and agriculture.

The engineered bacterium is intended to sense a key biomarker of gut inflammation and, in response, produce and secrete a therapeutic protein directly at the site of inflammation.\n\nFor the design of the genetic circuit, the following components are available. All components are to be encoded on a single plasmid.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n*   **Inflammation Sensor:** Nitric Oxide (NO) is a molecule produced at high concentrations during intestinal inflammation. The bacterial promoter `P_norV` is transcriptionally silent by default but becomes strongly activated in the presence of NO. This activation requires the transcriptional activator protein, `NorR`.\n*   **Transcriptional Activator:** The protein `NorR`, encoded by the `norR` gene, binds to `P_norV` and activates transcription only when NO is present.\n*   **Therapeutic Protein:** Human Interleukin-10 (hIL-10), encoded by the `hIL-10` gene, is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that can ameliorate IBD symptoms.\n*   **Pro-inflammatory Cytokine:** Human Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (hTNF-$\\alpha$), encoded by the `hTNF_alpha` gene, is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that exacerbates IBD.\n*   **Secretion System:** To export the therapeutic protein out of the bacterial cell, the Type I Secretion System (T1SS) from an *E. coli* uropathogenic strain will be used. This requires:\n    1.  A C-terminal fusion of the protein to be secreted with the Hemolysin A secretion signal (HlyA_signal). A gene fusion is denoted as `gene-HlyA_signal`.\n    2.  The presence of the T1SS channel proteins, HlyB and HlyD, encoded by the genes `hlyB` and `hlyD`.\n*   **Promoter:** A strong, constitutive promoter, denoted as `P_const`, which ensures continuous gene expression.\n\n**Circuit Notation:**\n\n*   A genetic circuit is described as a series of transcriptional units separated by semicolons (`;`).\n*   Each transcriptional unit is written as `Promoter -> Gene(s)`. For example, `P_const -> norR` means the `norR` gene is expressed from the constitutive promoter `P_const`.\n*   `hlyB + hlyD` indicates that both genes are co-transcribed as an operon.\n\nGiven these components and goals, which of the following plasmid designs represents the most functionally sound and logical approach for the intended living therapeutic?\n\nA. `P_const` -> `norR` ; `P_norV` -> `hIL-10-HlyA_signal` ; `P_const` -> `hlyB` + `hlyD`\n\nB. `P_const` -> `norR` ; `P_const` -> `hIL-10-HlyA_signal` ; `P_const` -> `hlyB` + `hlyD`\n\nC. `P_const` -> `norR` ; `P_norV` -> `hTNF_alpha-HlyA_signal` ; `P_const` -> `hlyB` + `hlyD`\n\nD. `P_norV` -> `hIL-10-HlyA_signal` ; `P_const` -> `hlyB` + `hlyD`\n\nE. `P_const` -> `norR` ; `P_norV` -> `hIL-10`", "solution": "We identify the design requirements from the stated biological principles:\n1) The inflammation sensor logic requires that the NO-inducible promoter is silent without NO and activates transcription only in the presence of NO when NorR is available. Therefore, NorR must be present in the cell irrespective of NO, implying it should be expressed from a constitutive promoter.\n2) The therapeutic must be produced only at the site of inflammation, so hIL-10 expression should be placed under the NO-inducible promoter rather than a constitutive promoter.\n3) Secretion via T1SS requires both a C-terminal HlyA secretion signal fused to the cargo protein and the constitutive presence of the secretion channel proteins HlyB and HlyD to ensure secretion capacity whenever the cargo is produced.\n4) The design must not exacerbate inflammation; thus, expression of a pro-inflammatory cytokine like hTNF_alpha is contraindicated.\n5) A therapeutic that is intended to act extracellularly must include the secretion signal and the secretion machinery; omitting either compromises function.\n\nEvaluate each option against these requirements:\n- Option A: NorR is expressed constitutively, enabling NO-responsive activation of P_norV; hIL-10 is under P_norV and fused to HlyA_signal, ensuring NO-triggered production and secretion; HlyB and HlyD are constitutively available. This meets all requirements.\n- Option B: hIL-10-HlyA_signal is under a constitutive promoter, which eliminates NO-responsiveness and risks continuous cytokine secretion; this violates requirement 2.\n- Option C: Places the pro-inflammatory hTNF_alpha under the NO-inducible promoter; this contradicts therapeutic goals by potentially worsening inflammation; violates requirement 4.\n- Option D: Lacks constitutive norR expression, so P_norV would not be properly activated by NO; violates requirement 1.\n- Option E: Misses the secretion signal and secretion machinery needed for extracellular delivery; violates requirement 3.\n\nTherefore, only Option A satisfies all logical and functional constraints for the intended living therapeutic design.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2280020"}]}
