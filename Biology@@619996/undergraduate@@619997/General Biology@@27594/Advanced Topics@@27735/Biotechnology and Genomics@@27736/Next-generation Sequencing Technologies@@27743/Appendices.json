Next-generation sequencers assign a Phred quality score ($Q$) to each base they call, but what does this number actually mean? This exercise provides a direct, hands-on way to translate this crucial metric into a concrete error probability ($P_e$), giving you an intuitive feel for the confidence we can place in each piece of genetic information.", "problem": "In the field of genomics, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized our ability to read Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequences. After a sequencing run, each base call (A, T, C, or G) in a read is assigned a quality score to indicate the confidence in its identification. The most common metric is the Phred quality score, $Q$. This score is logarithmically related to the probability that a base call is incorrect, denoted as $P_e$. The relationship is defined by the formula:\n$$Q = -10 \\log_{10}(P_e)$$\nA clinical genetics researcher is analyzing sequencing data for a patient to identify a potential disease-causing Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP). The analysis software flags a particular base at a critical position in a gene. For this specific base call, the instrument reports a Phred quality score of $Q = 20$.\n\nCalculate the probability, $P_e$, that this specific base call is incorrect.

Since humans are diploid organisms, we carry two copies of most chromosomes, which means we can possess two different alleles at a single genetic locus (heterozygosity). This practice challenges you to act like a geneticist, using the ratio of sequencing reads to distinguish between a homozygous and a heterozygous state, a fundamental skill in modern genomics.", "problem": "A geneticist is investigating the genetic basis of a metabolic disorder in a human patient. The patient's DNA is extracted from a blood sample and analyzed using a high-throughput method called Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). This technique involves sequencing millions of small DNA fragments in parallel and aligning them to a reference human genome. Humans are diploid organisms, carrying two copies of each autosomal chromosome, one inherited from each parent.\n\nFor a specific nucleotide position within a gene of interest on an autosome, the sequencing data reveals that the position is covered by 10,000 independent sequence reads. Of these reads, approximately 5,000 report the nucleotide as Cytosine (C), while the other approximately 5,000 report it as Thymine (T). The quality scores for these base calls are uniformly high, suggesting the sequencing instrument performed correctly.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and probable biological explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The patient is homozygous for this gene, but the sequencing process introduced a systematic error, causing half of the Cytosine bases to be misread as Thymine.\n\nB. The 'T' nucleotide is the result of a post-transcriptional modification, such as RNA editing, and does not reflect the patient's genomic DNA.\n\nC. The patient's blood sample was contaminated with an equal amount of DNA from another individual who is homozygous for the Thymine allele.\n\nD. This gene is located on the X chromosome, and the patient is a female who has one X chromosome inactivated.\n\nE. The patient is heterozygous at this specific nucleotide position, possessing one allele with Cytosine and another allele with Thymine.", "solution": "Humans are diploid for autosomes, so at any given autosomal locus an individual carries either two identical alleles (homozygous) or two different alleles (heterozygous). In an unbiased Next-Generation Sequencing experiment of genomic DNA, each read is an approximately independent sample from the pool of DNA molecules. If a locus is heterozygous with two alleles present at equal copy number, then the probability that a random read reports one allele equals its genomic fraction.\n\nFormally, let $n$ be the total number of independent reads covering the locus and let $p$ be the fraction of DNA molecules carrying Cytosine (C). The number of reads $K$ reporting C follows $K \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n,p)$, with expectation $E[K] = np$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(K) = np(1-p)$. For a diploid heterozygote with alleles C and T on an autosome, copy numbers are equal and thus $p = \\frac{1}{2}$, so the expected fraction of reads supporting each allele is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Observing approximately equal counts of C and T with uniformly high base-call quality is therefore the canonical signature of a heterozygous single-nucleotide variant on an autosome.\n\nConsider the alternatives:\nA. If the patient were homozygous C/C and sequencing introduced a systematic miscall, let $\\epsilon$ denote the per-base miscall probability from C to T. Then the expected T fraction among reads is $\\epsilon$. Achieving approximately equal C and T would require $\\epsilon \\approx \\frac{1}{2}$, which contradicts uniformly high quality scores (which imply $\\epsilon \\ll \\frac{1}{2}$) and typical instrument behavior. Systematic errors also tend to be context- or position-specific rather than producing a perfectly balanced two-allele signal.\nB. Post-transcriptional modifications such as RNA editing affect RNA, not genomic DNA. The assay sequenced genomic DNA from blood, so RNA editing cannot explain mixed DNA base calls at a genomic locus.\nC. For contamination, let $f$ be the fraction of contaminant DNA that is homozygous T/T mixed with a C/C patient at the locus. The expected T fraction is then $f$, so equal counts would require $f \\approx \\frac{1}{2}$, an extreme and atypical contamination level that would affect many loci genome-wide and is less probable than true heterozygosity, especially given the high-quality, balanced signal at a single autosomal site.\nD. X-chromosome inactivation pertains to gene expression and does not alter DNA sequence. Moreover, the locus is specified to be on an autosome, making X inactivation irrelevant.\n\nGiven diploidy, random sampling, and high-quality balanced base calls, the most accurate and probable explanation is that the patient is heterozygous (C/T) at this autosomal nucleotide position.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2304590"}, {"introduction": "The power of next-generation sequencing extends beyond identifying single nucleotide changes; it's also a formidable tool for detecting large-scale structural variations. Paired-end sequencing, where both ends of a DNA fragment are sequenced, provides information not just about the sequence itself, but also about the distance between the two reads. This exercise explores how a mismatch between the expected fragment size and the mapped distance on a reference genome can be a tell-tale sign of a major genomic event, such as a deletion.", "problem": "In a genomics research project, a scientist is analyzing a human DNA sample using a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform with a paired-end sequencing strategy. A DNA library was prepared by fragmenting the genomic DNA, and size selection was performed to create a library of fragments with a mean length of $L_{frag} = 485$ base pairs (bp), with a standard deviation of $\\sigma = 45$ bp. The sequencer generates a pair of reads for each fragment, one from each end. These read pairs are then aligned to the human reference genome.\n\nDuring the analysis of the alignment data, one specific read pair catches the scientist's attention. Both reads from this pair map uniquely to chromosome 7 with the expected forward-reverse orientation. However, the mapped positions are unusually far apart. The total distance on the reference genome, measured from the 5'-most coordinate of the forward read to the 3'-most coordinate of the reverse read, is observed to be $D_{map} = 5320$ bp.\n\nAssuming this anomalously large mapped distance is caused by a single, contiguous heterozygous deletion in the DNA sample relative to the reference genome, calculate the size of this deletion. Express your answer in base pairs (bp).", "solution": "Define $s$ as the size of the deletion (in base pairs). In paired-end sequencing, for a properly oriented pair without structural variation, the mapped outer distance on the reference (from the 5'-most base of the forward read to the 3'-most base of the reverse read) equals the physical fragment length of the DNA molecule from which the reads were generated. Denote this fragment length by $L$. Thus, in the absence of variation, one expects\n$$\nD_{map} = L.\n$$\nIf there is a deletion of size $s$ in the sample relative to the reference and the fragment spans this deletion, then the reference contains an additional contiguous segment of length $s$ between the read anchors that is absent in the sample molecule. Consequently, the mapped distance on the reference is increased by $s$:\n$$\nD_{map} = L + s.\n$$\nSolving for the deletion size gives\n$$\ns = D_{map} - L.\n$$\nFor a typical fragment drawn from the library, $L$ is well-approximated by the library mean $L_{frag}$; therefore, the point estimate for the deletion size is\n$$\n\\hat{s} = D_{map} - L_{frag}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $D_{map} = 5320$ bp and $L_{frag} = 485$ bp,\n$$\n\\hat{s} = 5320 - 485 = 4835 \\text{ bp}.\n$$\nThe provided standard deviation characterizes the library insert-size dispersion but does not alter the point estimate from this single anomalous pair.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4835}$$", "id": "2304570"}]}
