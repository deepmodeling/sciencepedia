{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A robust species tree is built on the foundation of comparing correct genes across species—specifically, genes that are direct evolutionary counterparts, known as orthologs. This exercise demonstrates a critical pitfall in phylogenomics: confusing orthologs with paralogs, which arise from gene duplication events. By working through this scenario [@problem_id:2307537], you will see how a simple error in automated gene sorting can lead to an inferred species tree that is completely in conflict with the true history of the species.", "problem": "A phylogenomicist is investigating the evolutionary history of three fungal species, designated A, B, and C. Extensive prior research has firmly established that the true species phylogeny is `((A, B), C)`, which indicates that species A and B share a more recent common ancestor with each other than either does with species C.\n\nIn their analysis, the researcher focuses on a gene family named 'Zingiberene synthase-like' (ZSL). The evolutionary history of this gene family has been determined as follows:\n1. In the last common ancestor of all three species, an ancestral gene, `ZSL_anc`, underwent a gene duplication event, giving rise to two distinct paralogous lineages, `ZSL_alpha` and `ZSL_beta`.\n2. Following this duplication, a speciation event occurred that separated the lineage leading to species C from the common ancestor of species A and B.\n3. In the lineage that led to species C, the `ZSL_beta` gene was lost. The `ZSL_alpha` gene was retained and is now found as `ZSL_C_alpha` in species C.\n4. The common ancestor of species A and B retained both the `ZSL_alpha` and `ZSL_beta` paralogs.\n5. Finally, the speciation event that separated species A and B occurred. As a result, species A contains genes `ZSL_A_alpha` and `ZSL_A_beta`, and species B contains genes `ZSL_B_alpha` and `ZSL_B_beta`.\n\nThe researcher's objective is to reconstruct the species tree using a method that requires identifying single-copy orthogroups (a set containing exactly one gene from each species, where all genes are true orthologs). They use a high-throughput automated software pipeline for this task. Due to a technical artifact related to sequence composition, the pipeline makes an error and incorrectly identifies the set `{ZSL_A_beta, ZSL_B_alpha, ZSL_C_alpha}` as a valid single-copy orthogroup.\n\nUnaware of this critical error in orthogroup assignment, the researcher proceeds to build a phylogenetic tree based on the sequence alignment of these three genes, assuming they are true orthologs. If this resulting gene tree's topology is then interpreted as representing the species phylogeny, which of the following evolutionary relationships for species A, B, and C will be incorrectly inferred?\n\nA. `((A, B), C)`\n\nB. `((A, C), B)`\n\nC. `((B, C), A)`\n\nD. A three-way polytomy `(A, B, C)`, indicating that the relationships cannot be resolved.", "solution": "We begin from the established species phylogeny, which is $((A,B),C)$. The ZSL gene family experienced a duplication in the last common ancestor of all three species, producing two paralogs, which we denote as $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. By definition, this duplication predates all subsequent speciations, so in the gene tree the deepest split is between the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ clades.\n\nAfter the duplication, the speciation dividing $C$ from the ancestor of $A$ and $B$ occurred. Along the $C$ lineage, the $\\beta$ copy was lost, leaving only $C_{\\alpha}$. In the $AB$ ancestor, both copies were retained and subsequently passed to $A$ and $B$, yielding $A_{\\alpha},A_{\\beta}$ in $A$ and $B_{\\alpha},B_{\\beta}$ in $B$.\n\nThus, the true gene tree structure is:\n- A duplication at the root that splits the tree into two clades: the $\\alpha$ clade and the $\\beta$ clade.\n- Within the $\\alpha$ clade, the three orthologs follow the species topology $((A_{\\alpha},B_{\\alpha}),C_{\\alpha})$.\n- Within the $\\beta$ clade, only $A_{\\beta}$ and $B_{\\beta}$ are present (since $C_{\\beta}$ was lost), forming a two-taxon clade.\n\nThe pipeline erroneously selects the set $\\{A_{\\beta},B_{\\alpha},C_{\\alpha}\\}$ as a single-copy orthogroup. When a phylogenetic tree is built on these three sequences, standard sequence-based methods will cluster sequences by the more recent common ancestry within the same paralog because the duplication predates the speciations; hence, the divergence between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is deeper than the divergences within the $\\alpha$ lineage. Consequently, $B_{\\alpha}$ and $C_{\\alpha}$ (both $\\alpha$ paralogs) will group together as sisters, with $A_{\\beta}$ (a $\\beta$ paralog) as the outgroup. The inferred gene tree on these three tips is therefore $((B_{\\alpha},C_{\\alpha}),A_{\\beta})$.\n\nIf this gene tree is then (incorrectly) interpreted as the species tree by replacing each tip with its species label and ignoring paralogy, the inferred species relationship becomes $((B,C),A)$.

With access to entire genomes, we can track large-scale evolutionary events like chromosomal rearrangements, where the order of genes changes over time.

They have sequenced the genomes of three closely related species, labeled A, B, and C, and a more distantly related outgroup species, O. Their analysis has identified a set of five syntenic Orthologous Gene Blocks (OGBs), which are present exactly once in a single linear chromosome in each species. The order of these OGBs, labeled 1 through 5, differs among the species due to chromosomal rearrangements.\n\nThe observed gene orders are as follows:\n- Species O (Outgroup): `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`\n- Species A: `(1, 3, 2, 4, 5)`\n- Species B: `(1, 2, 4, 3, 5)`\n- Species C: `(1, 3, 2, 5, 4)`\n\nTo reconstruct the evolutionary history, the biologists decide to use the gene order data within a maximum parsimony framework. The methodology is as follows:\n1.  A \"character\" is defined as a specific pair of adjacent OGBs, referred to as an adjacency. The order within the pair does not matter; for example, the adjacency `(2,3)` is identical to `(3,2)`.\n2.  The \"state\" of a character for a given species is '1' (present) if the adjacency exists in its chromosome, and '0' (absent) if it does not.\n3.  A character is considered \"phylogenetically informative\" for this 4-taxon analysis if at least two species have the '1' state and at least two species have the '0' state.\n4.  The \"parsimony score\" for a single character on a given phylogenetic tree is the minimum number of state changes (from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) along the branches required to explain the observed states at the tips of the tree.\n5.  The \"total parsimony score\" for a tree is the sum of the parsimony scores over all phylogenetically informative characters.\n\nConsidering all possible unrooted tree topologies for the four species (O, A, B, C), your task is to determine the most parsimonious phylogeny.

They use codon-based models of evolution to estimate the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates ($d_N/d_S$ or $\\omega$).
