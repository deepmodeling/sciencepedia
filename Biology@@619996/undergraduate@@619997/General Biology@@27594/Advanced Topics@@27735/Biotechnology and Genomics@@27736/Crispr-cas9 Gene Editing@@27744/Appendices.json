{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The power of the CRISPR-Cas9 system lies in its ability to be precisely programmed to target nearly any DNA sequence. The first and most critical step in any gene editing experiment is designing the guide RNA (gRNA) that directs the Cas9 enzyme to the correct genomic address. This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to apply the fundamental rules of SpCas9 targeting, challenging you to identify a valid Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) and select the corresponding 20-nucleotide sequence to create a gRNA that targets the beginning of a gene's coding region [@problem_id:1480230]. Mastering this process is essential for planning successful gene knockout experiments.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying a hypothetical gene involved in cellular metabolism. The gene's DNA sequence is provided below, with the top strand being the coding strand. The gene contains two exons and one intron. The first exon spans from nucleotide position 1 to 30, and the second exon begins at nucleotide position 61.\n\n5'- AATTGGCCTTAAGGCCTTAAGGCCTTAAGGGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGATTACAGATTACAGATTACAGGCTATAGCTAGCTAGCTA -3'\n3'- TTAACCGGAATTCCGGAATTCCGGAATTCCCATGACATGACATGACATGACATGACATGACCTAATGTCTAATGTCTAATGTCCTGATATCGATCGATCGAT -5'\n\nTo disrupt this gene, the biologist plans to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpCas9). This system employs a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific location in the genome. The targeting specificity is determined by two factors: a 20-nucleotide sequence within the sgRNA and a DNA motif called the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM).\n\nThe rules for SpCas9 targeting are as follows:\n1.  The Cas9 enzyme first recognizes the PAM sequence on the DNA. For SpCas9, the PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3', where 'N' can be any of the four DNA bases (A, T, C, G).\n2.  The PAM sequence must be present on the non-template strand (the strand that is not used as a template for gRNA binding).\n3.  The 20-nucleotide target site, known as the protospacer, is the sequence on the non-template strand located immediately upstream (to the 5' side) of the PAM sequence.\n4.  The 20-nucleotide guide portion of the sgRNA must have a sequence that is complementary to the template strand at the target site. This is equivalent to saying the sgRNA sequence is identical to the protospacer sequence, with all instances of Thymine (T) replaced by Uracil (U).\n\nYour task is to design a 20-nucleotide sgRNA sequence that will direct the Cas9 nuclease to cut as close as possible to the beginning of the second exon.\n\nProvide the sequence of this 20-nucleotide guide RNA in the 5' to 3' orientation.", "solution": "We are given that the top strand is the coding strand and that exon 2 begins at nucleotide position 61. For SpCas9, the targeting rules to apply are:\n- The PAM must be 5'-NGG-3' on the non-template strand.\n- The 20-nt protospacer is immediately upstream (5' side) of the PAM on the same non-template strand.\n- The sgRNA guide sequence is identical to the protospacer sequence with all T replaced by U (RNA), and is written 5' to 3'.\n\nIndex the provided top-strand sequence and mark the exon boundary at position 61. The intron spans positions 31 to 60, so the second exon begins at position 61. We search for the nearest PAM 5'-NGG-3' on the non-template strand as close as possible to position 61. Taking the top strand as the non-template strand for a potential target, scan for NGG near position 61. In the second exon region, the first occurrence of NGG on the top strand is at positions 81–83, which is 5'-AGG-3'.\n\nBy rule, the corresponding 20-nt protospacer on the non-template (top) strand is the sequence immediately upstream of that PAM, i.e., positions 61 through 80 inclusive. Reading the top strand from position 61 to 80 gives the 20-nt protospacer:\n`GATTACAGATTACAGATTAC`.\n\nThis site places the protospacer starting exactly at the beginning of exon 2 (position 61), and the PAM-adjacent cut by SpCas9 would occur upstream of the PAM, keeping the cleavage close to the exon start. Checking the opposite orientation (PAM on the bottom strand), which would require a 5'-CCN-3' motif on the top strand near position 61, reveals no CCN motif close enough to yield a cut closer to position 61 than the top-strand PAM at 81–83. Therefore, the top-strand PAM at 81–83 provides the closest feasible cut to the beginning of exon 2.\n\nThe sgRNA guide sequence is identical to the protospacer with T replaced by U, written 5' to 3'. Thus, the 20-nt sgRNA is:\n`GAUUACAGAUUACAGAUUAC`.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{GAUUACAGAUUACAGAUUAC}$$", "id": "1480230"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply disrupting genes, CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to make precise changes, such as correcting mutations or inserting new genetic information. This is achieved by co-opting the cell's Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) pathway, which uses a DNA template to repair a double-strand break. In this practice, you will move beyond gene knockout and learn to design a single-stranded donor template to insert a small peptide tag into a protein [@problem_id:2288704]. This task requires careful construction of homology arms that flank the desired insertion, providing a practical lesson in the sophisticated art of gene engineering.", "problem": "A research team is using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to engineer the C-terminus of a protein called `GeneY-protein`. Their goal is to insert a small, 6-nucleotide sequence that encodes a peptide tag for purification purposes. The insertion must occur precisely before the gene's stop codon to ensure the tag is part of the final protein product without disrupting translation termination.\n\nThe team has designed a guide RNA that directs the Cas9 nuclease to create a precise double-strand break (DSB) exactly between the last sense codon and the stop codon of `GeneY`. To repair this break and insert the tag, they will use Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) mediated by a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) donor template. This ssDNA donor template must contain the tag sequence flanked by \"homology arms\"—sequences identical to the DNA on either side of the DSB.\n\nYou are tasked with designing the correct ssDNA donor template.\n\n**Given Information:**\n1.  **Target DNA:** A segment of the `GeneY` coding strand (5' to 3') is shown below.

The sequence segment around the end reads: `... GCG CTG GAA G TGAAGG TAG GCT CAT GCA ...`. The triplet immediately following the final sense codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. Therefore, the double-strand break (DSB) occurs immediately before this TGA.\n\nStep 2: Determine where the 6-nt tag must be inserted. By the problem statement, the tag `5'-AGCTGA-3'` must be inserted precisely before the stop codon to keep the tag in-frame in the final protein product without disrupting translation termination. Thus, the correct donor must place `AGCTGA` immediately upstream of the TGA stop.\n\nStep 3: Determine the required homology arm content and orientation. The donor template must:\n- Be homologous to (same sense as) the provided coding strand.\n- Contain a Left Homology Arm (LHA) that exactly matches the nucleotides immediately upstream of the DSB (i.e., the sequence ending at the last base before the T in TGA).\n- Contain a Right Homology Arm (RHA) that exactly matches the nucleotides immediately downstream of the DSB, which therefore begins with the stop codon TGA followed by the downstream sequence shown.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options against these constraints.\n- Option A places `AGCTGA` immediately before TGA, keeps the donor in the same orientation as the coding strand, and uses the adjacent upstream sequence for the LHA and the downstream sequence starting with TGA for the RHA. This matches the required insertion position and sense.\n- Option B is in the reverse-complement orientation (and shows the tag reversed/complemented), which violates the requirement that the donor be homologous to the coding strand.\n- Option C places the `AGCTGA` after the TGA stop codon, violating the requirement that the tag be inserted before the stop codon.\n- Option D presents the downstream sequence first and then the upstream sequence (i.e., swaps arm order), so it is not arranged as LHA–insert–RHA in the required sense orientation.\n\nTherefore, only Option A satisfies all conditions: correct orientation, insertion immediately before the TGA stop codon, and correct use of flanking homology arms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2288704"}, {"introduction": "After designing and executing a gene editing experiment, how do you verify that the intended modification has actually occurred? The final and crucial step is molecular validation, which often involves amplifying the target locus and sequencing it. This exercise simulates the interpretation of real-world experimental data, asking you to predict the appearance of a Sanger sequencing chromatogram from a cell line containing a mix of wild-type and edited alleles [@problem_id:2311239]. Understanding how to interpret these results is a key skill for confirming the outcome of any gene editing experiment and diagnosing the nature of the edits obtained.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to engineer a specific genetic modification in a line of diploid human cells. The goal is to introduce a small, 5-base-pair deletion into an exon of a target gene. The editing machinery is delivered to the cells, and the cells are left to repair the DNA break via the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway.\n\nAfterward, the researcher isolates a single cell clone, which is presumed to be heterozygous for the modification—meaning one allele of the target gene contains the 5-base-pair deletion, while the other allele remains wild-type (unedited).\n\nTo verify this outcome, the researcher performs the following steps:\n1.  Genomic DNA is extracted from the clonal cell population.\n2.  The region of the gene flanking the intended deletion site is amplified using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with a single pair of primers.\n3.  The resulting pool of PCR products is then analyzed by Sanger sequencing, using one of the primers from the PCR step as the sequencing primer.\n\nSanger sequencing generates a chromatogram where fluorescent peaks correspond to the identity of the nucleotide at each position in the sequence. Given that the sequenced sample contains an equal mixture of PCR products from both the wild-type and the deleted allele, which of the following descriptions best characterizes the expected Sanger sequencing chromatogram for the region containing the edit?\n\nA. The chromatogram will show a clean, readable sequence that abruptly stops at the beginning of the 5-base-pair deletion, with no signal afterward.\n\nB. The chromatogram will be completely unreadable, with overlapping and noisy peaks starting from the very first base sequenced after the primer.\n\nC. The chromatogram will show a clean, readable sequence up to the point of the deletion. Immediately following the deletion site, the sequence will become unreadable, with a jumble of overlapping peaks of multiple colors.\n\nD. The chromatogram will show a clean, readable sequence throughout the entire amplified region, but with a noticeable 5-base-pair gap or blank space where the deletion occurred.\n\nE. The chromatogram will show two distinct, parallel sets of clean peaks after the deletion site, allowing the user to simultaneously read both the wild-type and the deleted sequence.", "solution": "- The PCR amplifies both alleles with the same primer pair, producing two amplicon species: one wild-type and one carrying a 5-base-pair deletion. Because the clone is heterozygous, these two templates are present at approximately equal abundance.\n\n- In Sanger sequencing, a single sequencing primer is extended on a mixed template pool. The fluorescent trace at each position reflects the superposition of terminated fragments generated from all templates present. If all templates share the same sequence at a given position, the chromatogram shows a single clean peak for that base. If templates differ at a position, overlapping peaks appear.\n\n- Upstream of the deletion, the wild-type and deleted alleles are identical in sequence and length alignment relative to the primer. Therefore, extension products from both templates contribute the same base at each position, yielding clean, single peaks in the chromatogram up to the cut site.\n\n- At the deletion site, the two templates diverge in length and sequence register. The deleted allele is shorter by 5 bases relative to the wild-type. This introduces a phase shift: bases from the deleted allele after the break are offset by 5 positions relative to the wild-type sequence.\n\n- In Sanger electropherograms, such a phase shift causes the signals from the two templates to overlap out of register. The chromatogram immediately beyond the deletion becomes a composite of two different sequences shifted relative to each other, producing multiple, overlapping peaks at each nominal position. This appears as a mixed, noisy, and progressively degraded trace that is not cleanly readable.\n\n- Consequently, the expected appearance is a clean, readable sequence up to the deletion, followed by unreadable, overlapping peaks starting immediately after the deletion site.\n\n- This matches option C. Options A, D, and E are inconsistent with Sanger trace behavior (no abrupt stop, no blank gap, and no separate parallel peak sets). Option B is incorrect because the trace is clean before the divergence point.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2311239"}]}
