Southern, Northern, and Western blotting are powerful techniques, but each is designed to detect a different type of molecule—DNA, RNA, and protein, respectively. This first exercise challenges you to apply this fundamental principle to a common scenario in genetics research, ensuring you can match a specific biological question to the most direct and effective blotting technique [@problem_id:2282386].", "problem": "A molecular biologist, Dr. Sharma, is investigating a specific inherited disorder characterized by a dysfunctional cellular receptor. Her hypothesis is that affected individuals possess a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding this receptor. This type of mutation introduces a premature stop codon, which she predicts would lead to the synthesis of a truncated, and therefore smaller, non-functional protein. She has two cell lines in her lab: a wild-type line expressing the normal, full-length receptor protein, and a patient-derived line suspected to express the truncated version. Her primary goal is to obtain direct experimental evidence that the patient-derived cells are indeed producing a receptor protein that is smaller in size than the one produced by the wild-type cells.\n\nWhich of the following molecular biology techniques would be the most direct and effective method for Dr. Sharma to specifically test her hypothesis about the protein's size?\n\nA. Western Blot\n\nB. Southern Blot\n\nC. Northern Blot\n\nD. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) followed by Sanger Sequencing\n\nE. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)", "solution": "Dr. Sharma’s hypothesis is that a nonsense mutation introduces a premature stop codon in the receptor gene, producing a truncated protein that is smaller than the wild-type full-length receptor. The most direct experimental test is to compare the molecular size of the receptor protein produced in wild-type versus patient-derived cells.\n\nTo directly assess protein size, one must separate proteins based on molecular weight and then specifically detect the receptor. Western blotting accomplishes this by:\n1. Denaturing and resolving cellular proteins by size using SDS-PAGE, where smaller polypeptides migrate further than larger ones.\n2. Transferring proteins to a membrane and probing with an antibody specific to the receptor, ensuring detection is specific to the protein of interest.\n3. Visualizing band positions: a truncated protein will appear as a band at a lower apparent molecular weight compared to the wild-type band, thereby providing direct evidence about protein size.\n\nEvaluation of alternatives:\n- Southern blot analyzes DNA fragments; it cannot provide information about protein size.\n- Northern blot analyzes RNA size; it does not inform on protein size and is confounded by potential nonsense-mediated decay, which may reduce mRNA levels without indicating protein size.\n- PCR followed by Sanger sequencing detects the genetic mutation at the DNA level; while it can confirm a premature stop codon, it does not directly demonstrate whether a truncated protein is produced or its size in cells.\n- ELISA quantifies protein abundance via antibody binding but does not resolve proteins by size and therefore cannot distinguish full-length from truncated forms.\n\nTherefore, Western blot is the most direct and effective method to test the hypothesis about the protein’s size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2282386"}, {"introduction": "Western blotting is not just for confirming a protein's presence; it can also reveal crucial information about its regulation through post-translational modifications. The appearance of unexpected bands often tells a deeper story. This practice asks you to interpret a distinct, ladder-like pattern on a Western blot, learning to recognize it as the classic signature of polyubiquitination—a key cellular signal for protein degradation [@problem_id:2282418]. By analyzing the mass differences between bands, you can decode the molecular events occurring in the cell.", "problem": "A cell biology student is investigating a newly identified protein called \"Stabilitin,\" which has a predicted molecular weight of 60.0 kDa. The student hypothesizes that Stabilitin is targeted for degradation in response to a specific cellular stressor. To test this, they perform a Western blot analysis. Lysates were prepared from a control group of cells and a group of cells exposed to the stressor for one hour. The lysates were separated by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a membrane, and probed with a highly specific antibody against Stabilitin.\n\nThe results show a single, sharp band at 60.0 kDa for the control sample. In contrast, the sample from the stressed cells shows a band at 60.0 kDa, along with additional distinct bands at approximately 68.5 kDa, 77.0 kDa, and 85.5 kDa.\n\nFor your reference, the monomeric protein ubiquitin has a molecular weight of approximately 8.5 kDa. The addition of a single phosphate group during phosphorylation adds approximately 80 Da (0.080 kDa) to a protein's mass.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following is the most plausible molecular explanation for the pattern observed in the stressed cells?\n\nA. Stabilitin undergoes extensive proteolytic degradation.\n\nB. Stabilitin forms stable dimers and trimers.\n\nC. Stabilitin is multiply phosphorylated.\n\nD. Stabilitin undergoes polyubiquitination.\n\nE. The *Stabilitin* gene is subject to alternative splicing, producing larger isoforms.", "solution": "Let the unmodified molecular mass of Stabilitin be $M_{0}=60.0\\,\\text{kDa}$, as observed in the control sample.

Achieving an $8.5\\,\\text{kDa}$ shift would require $n=\\frac{8.5}{0.080}\\approx 106.25$ phosphates, which is biologically implausible; moreover, phosphorylation would produce much smaller mass shifts and not a ladder with $8.5\\,\\text{kDa}$ spacing.\n- Proteolytic degradation produces lower-mass fragments; SDS-PAGE would show bands below $M_{0}$, not above.\n- Stable dimers or trimers would produce bands near $2M_{0}=120.0\\,\\text{kDa}$ and $3M_{0}=180.0\\,\\text{kDa}$, not at $68.5$, $77.0$, and $85.5\\,\\text{kDa}$. Under SDS-PAGE (denaturing, reducing) noncovalent oligomers are typically dissociated.\n- Alternative splicing could yield distinct isoforms, but the stressed sample shows bands precisely offset from $M_{0}$ by integer multiples of $8.5\\,\\text{kDa}$, matching ubiquitin additions rather than arbitrary exon inclusion. Also, such isoforms would not necessarily be stress-dependent and would not form a ubiquitin-sized ladder.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is stress-induced polyubiquitination of Stabilitin, yielding a ladder at $M_{0}+nU$ and marking the protein for degradation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2282418"}, {"introduction": "Blotting techniques can be extended beyond qualitative analysis to perform powerful quantitative measurements of cellular dynamics.
