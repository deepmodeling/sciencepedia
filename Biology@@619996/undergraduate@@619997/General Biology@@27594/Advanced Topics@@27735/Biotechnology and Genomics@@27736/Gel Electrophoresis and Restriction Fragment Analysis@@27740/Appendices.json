The circular plasmid vector, named pVect-1, is 5000 base pairs (bp) in length. Its map is numbered clockwise from 1 to 5000. The vector contains a unique restriction site for the enzyme `HindIII` at position 200 and a unique cloning site for the enzyme `EcoRI` at position 1000.\n\nThe gene of interest is on a 2000 bp linear DNA fragment that was prepared by digestion with `EcoRI`.

This practice problem presents a common scenario: a restriction digest that appears to have completely failed. Instead of simply calculating expected fragment sizes, you must think like a biochemist, diagnosing the potential reasons for the failure by considering the essential components and conditions required for enzymatic activity. [@problem_id:1489828]", "problem": "A molecular biology student is performing a quality control check on a newly prepared batch of a circular plasmid. The plasmid has a total size of 7,500 base pairs (bp). According to its known sequence map, it contains exactly two recognition sites for the restriction enzyme BamHI. A complete digestion with BamHI is expected to yield two linear DNA fragments of 3,000 bp and 4,500 bp.\n\nThe student sets up a reaction containing the plasmid DNA, the BamHI enzyme, and a commercial reaction buffer guaranteed by the manufacturer to be optimal for BamHI. The mixture is incubated at the recommended temperature of 37°C for 60 minutes. To analyze the result, the student loads the entire reaction product into a well of an agarose gel, next to a lane containing a standard DNA ladder. After electrophoresis and staining, the student is surprised to find only a single DNA band in their sample lane. This band migrates much faster than the 4,500 bp ladder marker, at a position characteristic of the uncut, supercoiled form of the 7,500 bp plasmid.\n\nAssuming the student's observation and interpretation are correct, which of the following represent plausible and distinct scientific explanations for the complete failure of the digestion reaction? Select all that apply.\n\nA. The student accidentally used a micropipette tip that was contaminated with a small amount of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which was then introduced into the reaction tube.\n\nB. The student forgot to add the fluorescent staining dye to the molten agarose when preparing the gel, so no DNA was visible.\n\nC. A spontaneous mutation occurred within one of the two BamHI recognition sites in the entire population of plasmid molecules used in the reaction.\n\nD. The stock solution of BamHI enzyme had been previously subjected to several freeze-thaw cycles, leading to a significant loss of enzymatic activity.\n\nE. The concentration of agarose in the gel was too low, allowing the two digested fragments to migrate so quickly that they ran off the end of the gel.\n\nF. The plasmid DNA stock solution was prepared using a water source that was not deionized, containing stray divalent cations like $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ or $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ that interfered with the reaction.", "solution": "We begin by interpreting the observation: after incubation with BamHI under nominally correct conditions, only a single band is observed that migrates at the position characteristic of the uncut supercoiled 7,500 bp plasmid. In a complete digestion of a circular plasmid with two BamHI sites, the expected outcome is two linear fragments of 3,000 bp and 4,500 bp. If the enzyme had cut even once (with only one site available), the expected product would be a linearized plasmid of 7,500 bp, which migrates differently from the supercoiled form. Therefore, the single supercoiled band implies that no double-strand cleavage occurred on any plasmid molecules, i.e., a complete failure of the digestion reaction.\n\nEvaluate each option using biochemical principles of restriction endonuclease activity and gel electrophoresis behavior:\n\nA. EDTA contamination. Principle: Type II restriction endonucleases like BamHI require the divalent cation cofactor $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ for catalysis. EDTA is a strong chelator of divalent cations, sequestering $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and thereby abolishing catalytic activity. Even small amounts can reduce free $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ below the level needed for activity. This would yield no cleavage and the observed uncut supercoiled band. This is plausible.\n\nB. No stain in the gel. Principle: Without intercalating dye in-gel (and absent post-staining), no DNA bands would be visible. The student reports seeing a single band with migration characteristic of supercoiled DNA; this contradicts the premise of no staining. Therefore, this cannot explain the observed band and is not a plausible explanation for the digestion failure.\n\nC. Mutation in one of the two BamHI sites in the entire plasmid population. Principle: If one site is mutated and the other remains intact, BamHI would cut once per plasmid and produce a single linear species of 7,500 bp. A linear 7,500 bp band migrates differently from the supercoiled 7,500 bp band and would not appear at the supercoiled position. The observation is a supercoiled band, implying no cutting. Moreover, the statement specifies a mutation in one site (not both), which would not prevent all cutting. Thus, this does not plausibly explain the observed complete lack of digestion.\n\nD. Enzyme inactivation by freeze-thaw. Principle: Repeated freeze-thaw cycles denature proteins and reduce enzymatic activity, potentially to near zero. If BamHI activity were lost, no cutting would occur, leaving only the supercoiled plasmid band. This is a plausible cause.\n\nE. Gel agarose concentration too low so fragments ran off. Principle: If digestion were complete but fragments ran off, there would be no remaining supercoiled plasmid, since the starting substrate would have been fully converted to linear fragments. Observing a single band at the supercoiled position is incompatible with this scenario. Therefore, low agarose concentration cannot explain the presence of a supercoiled band and does not account for digestion failure.\n\nF. Non-deionized water containing divalent cations such as $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ or $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$. Principle: BamHI catalysis requires $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$; other divalent cations can compete with or displace $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ at the active site or otherwise inhibit catalysis, reducing or abolishing activity. Contaminant $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ or $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ in the DNA stock can perturb the ionic environment despite an optimal commercial buffer and inhibit cleavage. This can yield no digestion and a supercoiled band. This is plausible.\n\nFrom this analysis, the plausible and distinct explanations for complete failure of the digestion that match the observation are A, D, and F.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADF}$$", "id": "1489828"}]}
