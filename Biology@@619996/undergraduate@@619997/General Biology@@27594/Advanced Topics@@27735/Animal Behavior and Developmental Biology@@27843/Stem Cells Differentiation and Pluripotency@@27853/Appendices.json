{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "In the daily practice of cell biology, the simple act of looking through a microscope is a powerful diagnostic tool. The physical appearance, or morphology, of a cell can reveal a wealth of information about its identity and functional state. This exercise challenges you to apply these observational skills to a common scenario in regenerative medicine: distinguishing healthy, undifferentiated pluripotent stem cell colonies from cells that have spontaneously begun to differentiate [@problem_id:2315403]. Mastering this visual assessment is a foundational skill for any researcher working to control and direct cell fate.", "problem": "A developmental biology student is tasked with maintaining a culture of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). The goal is to keep the cells in an undifferentiated state. After a week in culture, the student examines the dish under a phase-contrast microscope and observes two distinct regions with different cell morphologies.\n\nRegion 1 contains colonies that are tightly packed with sharp, well-defined borders. The individual cells within these colonies are small, relatively uniform in size, and exhibit a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, meaning the nucleus occupies most of the cell volume.\n\nRegion 2, typically found around the periphery of the colonies from Region 1, contains cells that are much larger, flattened, and possess an irregular, elongated, spindle-like shape. These cells are sparsely distributed and do not form discrete colonies.\n\nBased on these morphological characteristics, which of the following statements provides the most accurate interpretation of the state of the cell culture?\n\nA. The cells in Region 1 are undergoing apoptosis (programmed cell death), while the cells in Region 2 represent the healthy, undifferentiated PSCs.\n\nB. The cells in Region 1 represent healthy, undifferentiated PSCs, while the cells in Region 2 have undergone spontaneous differentiation into a mesenchymal lineage, such as fibroblasts.\n\nC. The entire culture is contaminated with bacteria (Region 1) and fungi (Region 2).\n\nD. Both regions contain healthy, undifferentiated PSCs, but the cells in Region 2 are simply in a different phase of the cell cycle than the cells in Region 1.\n\nE. The cells in Region 2 represent healthy, undifferentiated PSCs, while the cells in Region 1 are an artifact of the culture medium precipitating out of solution.", "solution": "We interpret the two regions by applying established morphological criteria for human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and common culture artifacts.\n\nFirst, undifferentiated human PSCs typically form tightly packed colonies with sharp borders; the constituent cells are small, relatively uniform, and display a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio. These features are consistent with Region 1, indicating healthy, undifferentiated PSCs rather than apoptosis or artifacts. In apoptosis, cells undergo shrinkage, membrane blebbing, nuclear fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies; they do not present as cohesive colonies of uniformly small, high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio cells with crisp edges. Therefore, the hypothesis that Region 1 represents apoptosis is inconsistent with standard apoptotic morphology.\n\nSecond, spontaneous differentiation often occurs at colony edges due to microenvironmental gradients and reduced self-renewal signaling, producing cells that are larger, more flattened, migratory, and frequently spindle-shaped, consistent with a mesenchymal or fibroblast-like phenotype. Region 2â€™s larger, flattened, irregular, spindle-like cells, sparsely distributed and lacking discrete colonies, match this differentiated morphology. This pattern is typical around the periphery of PSC colonies.\n\nThird, contamination does not fit these observations. Bacterial contamination typically appears as small refractile particles that move in Brownian motion and do not form organized spindle-shaped cells; fungal contamination often presents hyphae or budding yeast forms, not adherent spindle-shaped cells that resemble fibroblasts. Thus, contamination is unlikely.\n\nFourth, differences in cell cycle phase in PSCs do not produce such dramatic shifts from compact, high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio cells in cohesive colonies to large, flattened, spindle-like, colony-independent cells. Cell cycle differences may subtly alter nuclear size or mitotic figures but do not create fibroblast-like morphology.\n\nFifth, precipitation artifacts in culture media appear as crystalline or granular deposits without nuclear structure and do not organize into colonies with defined borders, nor do they resemble viable spindle-shaped cells.\n\nCombining these criteria, the most accurate interpretation is that Region 1 contains healthy, undifferentiated PSCs, while Region 2 represents spontaneous differentiation toward a mesenchymal/fibroblast-like lineage. This directly supports option B and excludes the alternatives for the reasons above.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2315403"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond what cells look like, we delve into the molecular machinery that governs their identity. The decision for a stem cell to remain pluripotent or to differentiate is controlled by a complex network of genes and regulatory molecules. This thought experiment focuses on the critical role of microRNAs, small molecules that can act as master switches by turning off key genes [@problem_id:2315362]. By predicting the outcome of specific genetic manipulations, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how these post-transcriptional regulators enforce cell fate decisions.", "problem": "In the field of regenerative medicine, understanding the molecular circuitry that governs pluripotency and differentiation is paramount. Pluripotent stem cells, such as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), are maintained in an undifferentiated state by a core network of transcription factors, including OCT4 and SOX2. The process of differentiation involves the downregulation of these factors and the activation of lineage-specific genes.\n\nRecent studies have shown that this transition is tightly regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non-coding RNA molecules that typically repress gene expression by binding to the 3' Untranslated Region (3' UTR) of their target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, leading to their degradation or translational inhibition. One such microRNA, miR-145, is found to be virtually absent in pluripotent hESCs but is strongly upregulated upon the induction of differentiation. Its primary role during this process is to directly target the mRNAs of OCT4 and SOX2, thereby suppressing their expression and promoting the exit from pluripotency.\n\nA research team designs an experiment to dissect this regulatory pathway. They create two distinct genetically modified hESC lines:\n\n-   **Line 1 (Anti-miR Line)**: These hESCs are engineered to constitutively express a high level of a synthetic \"anti-miR-145\" molecule. This molecule is a stable RNA designed to specifically bind and sequester endogenous miR-145, rendering it non-functional.\n-   **Line 2 (Mut-UTR Line)**: In these hESCs, the genomic loci for OCT4 and SOX2 have been edited using precision gene editing. The modification specifically deletes the miR-145 binding sites from the 3' UTRs of the OCT4 and SOX2 genes, so that the mRNAs they produce lack the recognition sequence for miR-145. All other parts of the genes and the cell's machinery are unchanged.\n\nThese two modified cell lines, along with an unmodified wild-type (WT) control hESC line, are subjected to an identical differentiation protocol. This involves removing the pluripotency-supporting factors from their culture medium to trigger differentiation. The levels of OCT4 protein and a late-stage differentiation marker (e.g., a neuron-specific protein) are then monitored in all three cell lines over several days.\n\nBased on the provided information about the regulatory function of miR-145, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the experimental outcomes?\n\nA. Both the Anti-miR Line and the Mut-UTR Line will differentiate successfully, similar to the WT control, because miR-145 is only one of many redundant pathways controlling differentiation.\n\nB. The Mut-UTR Line will fail to differentiate and maintain high OCT4 levels, whereas the Anti-miR Line will differentiate normally because it can still produce miR-145, even if it is later inhibited.\n\nC. The WT control line will differentiate and show a rapid decrease in OCT4 levels, while both the Anti-miR Line and the Mut-UTR Line will exhibit a severe impairment or complete failure to differentiate, characterized by the persistent high expression of OCT4.\n\nD. The Anti-miR Line will fail to differentiate, but the Mut-UTR Line will differentiate even faster than the WT control because the absence of miRNA binding frees up ribosomes for more efficient translation of differentiation-related genes.\n\nE. The WT control line will differentiate as expected, the Anti-miR line will undergo massive cell death due to conflicting signals, and the Mut-UTR line will be unable to differentiate.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the outcome of a differentiation experiment involving three types of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs): wild-type (WT), a line expressing an inhibitor for miR-145 (Anti-miR Line), and a line with mutated miR-145 binding sites on its target mRNAs (Mut-UTR Line). The central regulatory principle is that upon a differentiation signal, miR-145 expression increases, which in turn represses the pluripotency factors OCT4 and SOX2, allowing differentiation to proceed.\n\nLet's analyze the expected behavior of each cell line under the differentiation protocol.\n\n1.  **Wild-Type (WT) Control Line**: When pluripotency-supporting factors are removed from the medium, these cells will receive signals to differentiate. As described, this process involves the natural upregulation of endogenous miR-145. The newly synthesized miR-145 will bind to the specific binding sites present in the 3' UTR of the OCT4 and SOX2 mRNAs. This binding will lead to the repression of OCT4 and SOX2 protein synthesis. The decrease in these key pluripotency factors is a critical step that allows the cells to exit the pluripotent state and commit to a differentiated lineage. Therefore, we expect the WT cells to show a progressive decrease in OCT4 protein levels and an increase in the expression of differentiation markers over time.\n\n2.  **Line 1 (Anti-miR Line)**: These cells are engineered to produce a molecule that sequesters and neutralizes miR-145. When these cells are placed in differentiation medium, they will still upregulate the transcription of the gene for miR-145, just like WT cells. However, the resulting miR-145 molecules will be immediately bound and inactivated by the constitutively expressed anti-miR-145 inhibitor. As a result, miR-145 is not available to repress its targets, OCT4 and SOX2. The translation of OCT4 and SOX2 mRNAs will continue unabated, keeping their protein levels high. Since high levels of OCT4 and SOX2 maintain the pluripotent state, these cells will be resistant to differentiation signals. They will fail to downregulate pluripotency and will not effectively express late-stage differentiation markers.\n\n3.  **Line 2 (Mut-UTR Line)**: These cells have a different modification that leads to the same functional block. When subjected to the differentiation protocol, they will also upregulate endogenous miR-145 normally. The miR-145 molecules will be present and active in the cytoplasm. However, the target mRNAs for OCT4 and SOX2 have been alteredâ€”the specific binding sites for miR-145 in their 3' UTRs have been deleted. Without these binding sites, miR-145 cannot recognize or bind to the OCT4 and SOX2 mRNAs. Consequently, it cannot mediate their repression. Much like in the Anti-miR line, the synthesis of OCT4 and SOX2 proteins will persist at high levels, effectively blocking the cells from exiting pluripotency and differentiating.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options:**\nBoth genetic manipulations, although targeting different components of the same pathway (one targets the miRNA itself, the other targets the recognition site on the mRNA), result in the same functional outcome: the disruption of miR-145's ability to repress OCT4 and SOX2. This sustained expression of pluripotency factors will inhibit or completely block the differentiation process in both the Anti-miR and Mut-UTR lines.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n-   **A**: This is incorrect. While differentiation is complex, the problem describes miR-145 as a key regulator for exiting pluripotency. Disrupting such a key node is expected to have a significant, not negligible, effect.\n-   **B**: This is incorrect. It rightly predicts the outcome for the Mut-UTR line but wrongly predicts that the Anti-miR line will differentiate normally. The Anti-miR molecule effectively creates a functional knockout of miR-145, which should also block differentiation.\n-   **C**: This option correctly describes the outcomes for all three lines. The WT control differentiates (OCT4 decreases), while both modified lines, for the reasons explained above, fail to differentiate and maintain high OCT4 levels. This is the most accurate prediction.\n-   **D**: This is incorrect. There is no basis described for the Mut-UTR Line to differentiate faster. The primary effect of the mutation is the failure to downregulate pluripotency factors, which would inhibit, not accelerate, differentiation.\n-   **E**: This option introduces cell death, which is a possible but secondary outcome not directly implied by the core regulatory logic. The primary, direct effect is a block on differentiation. Option C provides a more direct and accurate prediction based on the provided mechanism. The prediction for the Mut-UTR line is correct, but the overall statement is less accurate than C.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that both engineered lines will show a profound defect in differentiation due to the sustained expression of OCT4.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2315362"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of a stem cell's function is to watch it work within the complex, dynamic environment of a living tissue. This practice introduces you to lineage tracing, a powerful genetic technique that allows scientists to permanently mark a single stem cell and follow all of its descendants over time. By interpreting the results of a classic lineage tracing experiment in the intestinal lining, you will see how we obtain definitive proof of self-renewal and multipotency in vivo [@problem_id:2315397]. This exercise bridges the gap between cellular potential in a dish and cellular function in an organism.", "problem": "A researcher investigates the cellular hierarchy within the rapidly renewing epithelium of the mouse small intestine. To do so, a special transgenic mouse model is created. In this model, the expression of the gene for Cre recombinase is controlled by the promoter of the `Lgr5` gene, which is active in a specific population of cells at the base of intestinal crypts. The Cre recombinase enzyme is engineered to be functional only in the presence of the drug tamoxifen. Furthermore, the mouse's genome includes a reporter system: a ubiquitously active promoter is prevented from driving the expression of Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) by a `loxP`-flanked \"stop\" sequence. When active Cre recombinase is present, it excises this \"stop\" sequence, leading to permanent and heritable expression of YFP in the cell where recombination occurred and in all of its subsequent progeny.\n\nThe researcher administers a single, very low dose of tamoxifen to an adult mouse, sufficient to induce recombination in only a small number of individual Lgr5-expressing cells. The mouse is then maintained for 60 days. Upon examination of the intestinal tissue, the researcher observes long, coherent \"ribbons\" of YFP-positive cells. Each ribbon appears to originate from a single crypt and extends up the full length of an associated villus. Microscopic analysis confirms that within a single YFP-positive ribbon, multiple distinct cell types are present: absorptive enterocytes, mucus-secreting goblet cells, and hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells populate the villus, while antimicrobial Paneth cells are found at the crypt base, all glowing yellow. The Lgr5-expressing cell at the origin of the clone also remains YFP-positive. Many adjacent crypt-villus units are entirely devoid of YFP-positive cells.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following conclusions is the most strongly supported?\n\nA. Paneth cells, which are terminally differentiated, can de-differentiate back into Lgr5-expressing stem cells to maintain the tissue.\n\nB. There are at least two separate types of stem cells at the crypt base: one that generates Paneth cells, and a second, distinct population that generates all other epithelial cell types.\n\nC. A single Lgr5-expressing cell is a multipotent stem cell that can both self-renew and give rise to all differentiated lineages of the intestinal epithelium.\n\nD. The YFP reporter is transiently expressed after tamoxifen induction but is then permanently silenced in the Lgr5-expressing stem cell, while remaining active in its differentiated progeny.\n\nE. The observed ribbons are an artifact resulting from the random migration and convergence of labeled cells from several different crypts onto a single villus.", "solution": "The genetic system uses Cre-lox lineage tracing with an inducible Cre: Cre recombinase is expressed under the Lgr5 promoter and is activated only in the presence of tamoxifen. In the reporter, a ubiquitously active promoter is blocked by a loxP-flanked stop cassette; when Cre is active, it excises the stop, causing permanent and heritable YFP expression in the recombined cell and all of its progeny. A single, very low dose of tamoxifen ensures sparse recombination events, so that individual labeled clones originate from single Lgr5-expressing cells.\n\nAfter 60 days, the observation of long, coherent ribbons of YFP-positive cells starting from a single crypt and extending along a single associated villus, with many neighboring crypt-villus units lacking any YFP, is the expected pattern for clonal lineage tracing from a single labeled stem cell. The presence within a single ribbon of multiple differentiated epithelial lineagesâ€”absorptive enterocytes, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells along the villus, and Paneth cells at the crypt baseâ€”demonstrates that the single labeled Lgr5-expressing cell at the origin gives rise to all major epithelial lineages. The continued presence of the Lgr5-expressing cell at the origin of the ribbon, still YFP-positive after 60 days, shows that the labeled stem cell has self-renewed while continuously producing differentiated progeny. Together, these findings directly support that a single Lgr5-expressing cell is a multipotent, self-renewing stem cell for the intestinal epithelium.\n\nEvaluating alternatives:\n- Option A posits dedifferentiation of Paneth cells into Lgr5-expressing stem cells. The data instead show forward differentiation from a labeled Lgr5-expressing cell into Paneth and other lineages; dedifferentiation is neither required nor evidenced here.\n- Option B proposes two distinct stem cell types at the crypt base producing different lineages. A single coherent clone containing Paneth cells and all other epithelial types argues against this; one Lgr5-expressing cell generated all lineages in the ribbon.\n- Option D suggests YFP is silenced in the stem cell but persists in progeny. This is contradicted by the observation that the Lgr5-expressing origin cell remains YFP-positive long-term; Cre-mediated recombination renders YFP expression permanent in that cell and its descendants.\n- Option E claims the ribbons result from random convergence of labeled cells from multiple crypts. The coherent, clonal origin from a single crypt, the unidirectional migration of cells from crypt to villus, and the sparse labeling with many unlabeled neighboring units make random convergence highly unlikely and unnecessary to explain the observations.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly supported conclusion is that a single Lgr5-expressing cell is a multipotent stem cell that both self-renews and produces all epithelial lineages.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2315397"}]}
