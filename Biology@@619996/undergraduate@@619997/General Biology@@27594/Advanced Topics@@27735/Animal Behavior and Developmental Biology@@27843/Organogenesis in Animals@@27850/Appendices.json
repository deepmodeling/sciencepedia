{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A fundamental question in organogenesis is how different parts of the body acquire their unique identities along the head-to-tail axis. The discovery of Hox genes provided a profound answer, revealing a family of \"master regulator\" genes that act like a molecular toolkit for specifying regional anatomy. This exercise [@problem_id:2305578] invites you to perform a thought experiment, based on real genetic manipulations in model organisms, to explore the principle of posterior prevalence and understand how misexpression of a single Hox gene can dramatically transform the identity of an entire section of the skeleton.", "problem": "In vertebrate development, the identity of segments along the anteroposterior axis is determined by the combinatorial expression of a family of master regulatory genes known as Hox genes. These genes encode transcription factors that specify the morphological characteristics of each region of the developing body. In a typical mouse, the axial skeleton is divided into distinct regions. The thoracic vertebrae are defined by their articulation with ribs, which form the rib cage. The lumbar vertebrae, located posterior to the thoracic region, are robust and do not possess ribs.\n\nConsider a genetic engineering experiment conducted on a mouse embryo. In this experiment, a specific Hox gene, let's call it *Hox-L*, which is normally active only in the developing lumbar region and is responsible for conferring lumbar identity (i.e., no rib formation), is artificially expressed throughout the entire thoracic region starting from an early stage of development. Assume the embryo survives and develops a clear skeletal structure.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately predicts the resulting phenotype of the axial skeleton in this genetically modified mouse?\n\nA. The thoracic vertebrae develop normally with ribs, but the lumbar vertebrae are also induced to form a set of ribs.\nB. The developing thoracic vertebrae fail to form their associated ribs and instead adopt the morphology of lumbar vertebrae.\nC. The number of cervical vertebrae is reduced, and they are replaced by additional rib-bearing thoracic vertebrae.\nD. The entire vertebral column fails to segment, resulting in a single, fused bony rod.\nE. Both thoracic and lumbar vertebrae develop ribs, creating an extended rib cage that runs the length of the trunk.", "solution": "Hox genes encode transcription factors that specify regional identities along the anteroposterior axis through combinatorial codes, with the principle of posterior prevalence stating that posterior Hox gene functions dominate over anterior ones when coexpressed. In the axial skeleton, thoracic identity, including rib formation, is promoted by thoracic-patterning Hox genes (classically *Hox6* paralogs), while lumbar identity includes active repression of the rib program, classically by *Hox10* paralogs. The problem defines a gene, *Hox-L*, that is normally active in the lumbar region and confers lumbar identity, specifically preventing rib formation.\n\nArtificially expressing *Hox-L* throughout the thoracic region from an early developmental stage imposes a posterior (lumbar) identity on segments that would normally become thoracic. By posterior prevalence and the known function of lumbar Hox genes to repress the rib-forming program, the thoracic vertebrae will be homeotically transformed toward lumbar morphology and will fail to form ribs. The lumbar region, where *Hox-L* is normally active, remains lumbar and ribless.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA is incorrect because ectopic lumbar identity in the thorax would not induce ribs; instead, it would repress rib formation in the thorax, and the lumbar region would not gain ribs.\nB is correct because thoracic vertebrae exposed to *Hox-L* adopt lumbar identity and lose ribs.\nC is incorrect because the manipulation is specific to the thoracic domain and does not induce a conversion of cervical vertebrae into rib-bearing thoracic vertebrae.\nD is incorrect because segmentation failure involves somitogenesis pathways (e.g., Notch, Wnt, FGF clock and wavefront), not Hox patterning per se.\nE is incorrect because both thoracic and lumbar vertebrae bearing ribs would require loss of lumbar rib repression or gain of thoracic rib-promoting Hox activity in the lumbar region, which is the opposite of ectopic lumbar Hox expression.\n\nTherefore, the predicted phenotype is that the developing thoracic vertebrae fail to form ribs and adopt lumbar morphology.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2305578"}, {"introduction": "Organogenesis is not just about cells differentiating in place; it often involves remarkable journeys. Neural crest cells represent a quintessential example of this, acting as a migratory population of stem cells that travel throughout the embryo to form an astonishingly diverse array of tissues, from neurons to facial bones to pigment cells. This problem challenges you to predict the systemic consequences of halting the migration of these crucial cells [@problem_id:2305627], providing a practical understanding of how a single developmental process can be essential for the proper formation of multiple, seemingly disconnected organ systems.", "problem": "In a vertebrate embryology experiment, a novel chemical compound is introduced that specifically inhibits the delamination and migration of neural crest cells from their origin at the dorsal aspect of the neural tube. This inhibition is complete and affects all populations of neural crest cells along the entire anterior-posterior axis of the embryo, without directly affecting the development of the neural tube itself, the mesoderm, or the endoderm.\n\nGiven this scenario, which of the following structures or cell types would be absent or severely malformed in the resulting organism? Select all that apply.\n\nA. The sympathetic ganglia of the autonomic nervous system\nB. The motor neurons within the spinal cord that innervate skeletal muscles\nC. The melanocytes responsible for skin and hair pigmentation\nD. The dermis of the back\nE. The chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla\nF. The cartilage and bone that form the jaw\nG. The retina of the eye", "solution": "We first identify the experimental manipulation: complete inhibition of neural crest cell delamination and migration along the entire anterior-posterior axis, with normal development of neural tube, mesoderm, and endoderm. Therefore, all structures derived from neural crest would be absent or severely malformed, whereas structures derived from the neural tube (neuroectoderm proper), mesoderm, or endoderm would develop normally.\n\nPrinciple: Neural crest cell derivatives include peripheral nervous system components (sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia, autonomic ganglia including sympathetic and parasympathetic, Schwann cells), melanocytes, chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, craniofacial cartilage and bone (viscerocranium) derived from cranial neural crest, portions of the outflow tract septation of the heart, odontoblasts, and leptomeninges (pia and arachnoid). Neural tube derivatives include central nervous system neurons (e.g., motor neurons in the spinal cord) and retina (neuroectodermal derivative of the diencephalon). Mesodermal derivatives include, among others, the dermis of the back from paraxial mesoderm (dermatomes).\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- A. Sympathetic ganglia of the autonomic nervous system: These derive from neural crest cells; with migration inhibited, they would be absent. Therefore, A is correct.\n- B. Motor neurons within the spinal cord: These arise from the basal plate of the neural tube, which is unaffected. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n- C. Melanocytes: These pigment cells derive from neural crest; they would be absent. Therefore, C is correct.\n- D. Dermis of the back: This is derived from paraxial mesoderm (dermatomes), which is unaffected. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n- E. Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla: These derive from neural crest; they would be absent. Therefore, E is correct.\n- F. Cartilage and bone that form the jaw: Craniofacial cartilage and bone (viscerocranium) are largely neural crest-derived; they would be severely malformed or absent. Therefore, F is correct.\n- G. Retina of the eye: The retina is derived from neuroectoderm of the diencephalon (optic cup), i.e., neural tube derivative; unaffected.

The \"clock and wavefront\" model offers an elegant mechanism to explain this process, likening it to a molecular oscillator that periodically \"ticks\" to define a new segment from a growing tissue bed. By considering a hypothetical mutation that alters the speed of this developmental clock [@problem_id:2305589], you will gain a deeper, quantitative appreciation for how the physical size and total number of body segments are determined by the interplay between developmental timing and tissue growth rate.", "problem": "In vertebrate development, the axial skeleton (vertebrae and ribs) forms from segmented blocks of tissue called somites. These somites are sequentially formed from a region of embryonic tissue known as the Presomitic Mesoderm (PSM). The process is governed by a \"clock and wavefront\" model.\n\nThe \"clock\" is a molecular oscillator within the PSM cells that cycles with a specific period, $T$. Each time the clock completes a cycle, a boundary forms, pinching off one new somite from the anterior end of the PSM.\n\nConcurrently, the embryo grows, and the PSM elongates at a constant rate from its posterior end. The \"wavefront\" is a gradient of signaling molecules that marks the level of maturity of the PSM cells. The size of a newly formed somite is determined by the amount of tissue that has been incorporated into the PSM by this elongation process during one period of the clock.\n\nConsider a hypothetical animal where, due to a genetic mutation, the molecular clock in the PSM runs at half of its normal speed. Assume that the rate of PSM elongation and the total final length of the segmented axial skeleton remain unchanged compared to a normal animal. What would be the expected outcome for the vertebral column of the mutant animal?\n\nA. The vertebrae would be larger, and the total number of vertebrae would be smaller.\nB. The vertebrae would be smaller, and the total number of vertebrae would be larger.\nC. The vertebrae would be larger, but the total number of vertebrae would remain the same.\nD. The vertebrae would be smaller, but the total number of vertebrae would remain the same.\nE.

In the clock and wavefront model, one somite forms per clock cycle, and the linear size of one newly formed somite equals the tissue added during one period:\n$$s = vT.$$\nIf the total final segmented length of the axial skeleton is $L$, then the total number of somites (and hence vertebrae) is\n$$N = \\frac{L}{s} = \\frac{L}{vT}.$$\n\nIn the mutant, the clock runs at half speed, which means the period doubles:\n$$T' = 2T.$$\nThe elongation rate remains unchanged ($v' = v$), so the mutant somite size is\n$$s' = v'T' = v(2T) = 2(vT) = 2s.$$\nSince the total final segmented length remains the same ($L' = L$), the total number of vertebrae in the mutant is\n$$N' = \\frac{L'}{s'} = \\frac{L}{2s} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{L}{s}\\right) = \\frac{N}{2}.$$\n\nTherefore, the vertebrae are larger and fewer in number compared to normal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2305589"}]}
