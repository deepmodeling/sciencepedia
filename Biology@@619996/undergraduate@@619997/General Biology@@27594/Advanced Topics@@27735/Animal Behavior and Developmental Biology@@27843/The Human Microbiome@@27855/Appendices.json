They hypothesize that Intestinamine mimics a low-energy state in host cells by directly interacting with cellular energy-sensing pathways. To test this, they use a culture of human intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes) maintained in a nutrient-rich medium.\n\nIn the first phase of the experiment, they characterize the basal metabolic state of the control cells. The activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, is measured to be $A_{\\text{AMPK, basal}} = 130$ arbitrary units.
