The spread of the disease is modeled using a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) framework.

For this virus, the recovery rate is estimated to be $\\gamma = 0.125 \\text{ day}^{-1}$.\n\nThe parameter $\\beta$ is the effective transmission rate. This rate is known to be directly proportional to the average number of close contacts an individual has per day.
