[@problem_id:2277851]", "problem": "In a population of wild turkeys (*Meleagris gallopavo*), biologists observe that pairs of male full brothers often form coalitions to perform elaborate courtship displays. Within each coalition, only the dominant male attempts to mate with females, while the subordinate male assists in the display but forgoes his own mating opportunities.\n\nA long-term study provides the following data:\n- A dominant male in a coalition sires, on average, five more offspring than a male who displays alone. This increase is entirely due to the subordinate's help.\n- A subordinate male who helps his brother sires zero offspring. If this same male were to leave the coalition and display on his own, he would be expected to sire, on average, one offspring.\n- The coefficient of relatedness ($r$) between full siblings in this diploid species is 0.5.\n\nInclusive fitness is calculated as the sum of an individual's direct fitness (offspring they produce) and indirect fitness (offspring produced by relatives, weighted by the coefficient of relatedness). Calculate the net change in the subordinate brother's inclusive fitness that results from his choice to help his dominant brother instead of displaying alone. Express your answer as a numerical value in units of 'offspring equivalents'.", "solution": "To determine the net change in the subordinate's inclusive fitness, we must compare the fitness outcome of his two possible strategies: acting alone versus helping his brother. The net change is the inclusive fitness from helping minus the inclusive fitness from acting alone. A more direct way to conceptualize this is by calculating the net gain using the components of Hamilton's rule, which evaluates if the benefits of an altruistic act outweigh its costs.\n\nThe net change in inclusive fitness for an altruistic act is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{Net Change in Inclusive Fitness} = (\\text{Indirect Fitness Gain}) - (\\text{Direct Fitness Cost}) $$\n\nLet's define and calculate each term from the subordinate's perspective.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Indirect Fitness Gain:**\n    The indirect fitness gain is the portion of the subordinate's genes passed on through the extra offspring produced by his relative (the dominant brother) because of his help.\n    - The benefit to the recipient (the dominant brother), denoted as $B$, is the number of additional offspring he sires due to the help. The problem states this is 5 offspring. So, $B = 5$.\n    - This benefit must be devalued by the coefficient of relatedness, $r$, between the actor (subordinate) and the recipient (dominant brother). The problem states that for full siblings, $r = 0.5$.\n    - The indirect fitness gain is the product of these two values:\n    $$ \\text{Indirect Fitness Gain} = r \\times B = 0.5 \\times 5 = 2.5 $$\n    This means that by helping his brother sire 5 offspring, the subordinate gains the genetic equivalent of siring 2.5 of his own offspring.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Direct Fitness Cost:**\n    The direct fitness cost, denoted as $C$, is the reproductive success the subordinate gives up by choosing to help instead of pursuing his own reproductive strategy.\n    - The subordinate's reproductive success if he acts alone is 1 offspring.\n    - The subordinate's reproductive success if he helps his brother is 0 offspring.\n    - The cost is the difference between these two outcomes:\n    $$ C = (\\text{Fitness if acting alone}) - (\\text{Fitness if helping}) = 1 - 0 = 1 $$\n    So, the cost to the subordinate is 1 offspring.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Net Change in Inclusive Fitness:**\n    The net change is the indirect fitness gain minus the direct fitness cost.\n    $$ \\text{Net Change} = (r \\times B) - C $$\n    Substituting the values we calculated:\n    $$ \\text{Net Change} = 2.5 - 1 = 1.5 $$\n\nTherefore, the subordinate turkey's choice to help his brother results in a net gain of 1.5 'offspring equivalents' in his inclusive fitness. Because this value is positive, the altruistic behavior is favored by kin selection in this scenario.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.5}$$", "id": "2277851"}, {"introduction": "Evolution often presents organisms with strategic crossroads, forcing a choice between different life-history pathways.

Hamilton's rule states that an altruistic gene will increase in frequency if the fitness benefit to the recipient ($B$), weighted by the coefficient of relatedness between the actor and the recipient ($r$), is greater than the fitness cost to the actor ($C$). The condition is expressed as:\n$$rB > C$$\n\nIn this problem, Brother A is the actor and Brother B is the recipient. We must define the cost ($C$) and benefit ($B$) in terms of the given parameters. The fitness gain from a successful kill is given as $F$.\n\nFirst, we determine the cost ($C$) to the actor, Brother A. The cost is the expected fitness that Brother A forgoes by choosing to help rather than hunt alone.\n- Fitness if hunting alone: $p_{alone} \\times F$\n- Fitness if helping: $0$ (since he makes no attempt to hunt for himself)\nThe cost is the difference:\n$$C = (p_{alone} \\times F) - 0 = p_{alone}F$$\n\nNext, we determine the benefit ($B$) to the recipient, Brother B. The benefit is the *additional* fitness Brother B gains because of Brother A's help, compared to what he would have gained if Brother A had not helped (i.e., if both hunted alone).\n- Fitness of Brother B with help from Brother A: $p_{help} \\times F$\n- Fitness of Brother B without help (hunting alone): $p_{alone} \\times F$\nThe benefit is the difference:\n$$B = (p_{help} \\times F) - (p_{alone} \\times F) = (p_{help} - p_{alone})F$$\n\nNow we can substitute these expressions for $C$ and $B$ into Hamilton's rule:\n$$r \\times (p_{help} - p_{alone})F > p_{alone}F$$\n\nThe fitness unit $F$ appears on both sides of the inequality. Since $F$ represents a positive fitness gain, we can divide both sides by $F$ without changing the inequality direction. This shows that the decision does not depend on the absolute magnitude of the fitness gain.\n$$r(p_{help} - p_{alone}) > p_{alone}$$\nThis is the general condition for the altruistic act to be favored.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $r = 0.5$, $p_{alone} = 0.22$, and $p_{help} = 0.50$.\n$$0.5 \\times (0.50 - 0.22) > 0.22$$\n$$0.5 \\times (0.28) > 0.22$$\n$$0.14 > 0.22$$\n\nThis inequality is false. The relatedness-weighted benefit ($rB = 0.14F$) is less than the cost ($C = 0.22F$). Therefore, the altruistic behavior is not evolutionarily favored under these conditions.\n\nThe condition for the act to be \"not favored\" is the reverse of the condition for it to be \"favored\":\n$$r(p_{help} - p_{alone}) < p_{alone}$$\nor, equivalently,\n$$p_{alone} > r(p_{help} - p_{alone})$$\n\nLet's examine the choices:\nA. The act is favored because $p_{help} \\times r > p_{alone}$. This is an incorrect formulation of Hamilton's rule and leads to the wrong conclusion.\nB. The act is not favored because $p_{alone} > r(p_{help} - p_{alone})$. This statement correctly identifies that the act is not favored, and the mathematical inequality matches our derived condition for the act being disfavored. With the given values, $0.22 > 0.5(0.50 - 0.22)$ simplifies to $0.22 > 0.14$, which is true. This option is correct.\nC. The act is favored because $p_{help} > p_{alone}$. This reasoning is simplistic as it only compares the recipient's success with help to the actor's success alone, ignoring the cost and relatedness.\nD. The act is not favored because $r \\times p_{help} < p_{alone}$. This is an incorrect formulation. The statement $0.5 \\times 0.50 < 0.22$ simplifies to $0.25 < 0.22$, which is false.\nE. The act is favored because $r(p_{help}) > p_{alone}/2$.
