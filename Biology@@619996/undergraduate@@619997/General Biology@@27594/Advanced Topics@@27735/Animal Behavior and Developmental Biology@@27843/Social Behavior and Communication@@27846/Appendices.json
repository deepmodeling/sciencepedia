This exercise [@problem_id:2314547] challenges you to apply this foundational principle to a realistic ecological scenario, calculating the maximum fitness cost an animal can incur for an altruistic act to be evolutionarily viable.", "problem": "A field biologist is studying the social behavior of a species of highly social rodent. In this species, individuals often emit a loud alarm call when a predator is spotted, which alerts their nearby relatives but also increases the caller's own chances of being captured. This trade-off between personal cost and relatives' benefit is a classic example of kin selection.\n\nThe biologist's team has quantified these effects in terms of reproductive fitness units. They observe a specific event where an individual (the caller) gives an alarm call that successfully warns a group of its kin. This group consists of 4 full siblings and 6 first cousins. From extensive population data, it is known that the coefficient of relatedness between full siblings is $r_{\\text{sibling}} = 0.5$, and between first cousins is $r_{\\text{cousin}} = 0.125$.\n\nThe biologist estimates that by being warned, each surviving sibling gains an average fitness benefit of $b_{\\text{sibling}} = 2.0$ units, and each surviving cousin gains an average fitness benefit of $b_{\\text{cousin}} = 1.5$ units. For this altruistic act of giving an alarm call to be evolutionarily favored, the cost to the caller must be less than the total relatedness-weighted benefit to the recipients.\n\nCalculate the maximum possible fitness cost, $C$, that the caller can incur for this specific act to still be favored by natural selection.

The success of a given strategy often depends on the choices of others in the populationâ€”a concept at the heart of evolutionary game theory. This practice problem [@problem_id:2314533] invites you to model a classic conflict between \"territorial\" and \"sneaker\" males, using fitness functions to determine the stable equilibrium at which both strategies can coexist. Mastering this approach is key to understanding how natural selection can maintain behavioral diversity.", "problem": "In a species of fish, the Azure-finned Sunfish, males exhibit one of two distinct reproductive strategies. \"Territorial\" males are large, build and defend nests, and attract females to lay eggs. \"Sneaker\" males are smaller, do not build nests, and attempt to opportunistically fertilize eggs in the nests guarded by territorial males.\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of sneaker males in the population, where $0  p  1$. Consequently, the frequency of territorial males is $1-p$. The average reproductive success, or fitness, of each type of male depends on the frequencies of both strategies in the population. Based on field observations and population models, the fitness functions for the two strategies are given as follows:\n\nThe average fitness of a territorial male, $W_T$, is modeled by the function:\n$$W_T(p) = W_0 - C_S \\cdot p$$\nwhere $W_0$ is the baseline fitness of a territorial male in the absence of any sneakers, and $C_S$ is a cost coefficient representing the negative impact of competition and paternity loss from the sneaker population.\n\nThe average fitness of a sneaker male, $W_S$, is modeled by the function:\n$$W_S(p) = G_S \\cdot \\frac{1-p}{p}$$\nwhere $G_S$ is a gain coefficient representing the reproductive success a sneaker achieves by exploiting the nests of territorial males.\n\nAssume the following constant values for the population:\n- Baseline territorial fitness, $W_0 = 120$ fitness units.\n- Sneaker cost coefficient, $C_S = 180$ fitness units.\n- Sneaker gain coefficient, $G_S = 30$ fitness units.\n\nThe frequencies of the two strategies will evolve until they reach a stable equilibrium where both strategies can coexist in the population. Calculate the non-zero, stable equilibrium frequency of sneaker males. Express your answer as a fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "The problem asks for the stable equilibrium frequency $p$ of sneaker males. An equilibrium where both strategies coexist occurs when the fitness of a territorial male is equal to the fitness of a sneaker male. This is the point of frequency-dependent selection where neither strategy has an advantage. Therefore, we must set the two fitness functions equal to each other:\n$$W_T(p) = W_S(p)$$\n\nSubstitute the given expressions for $W_T(p)$ and $W_S(p)$ into the equation:\n$$W_0 - C_S \\cdot p = G_S \\cdot \\frac{1-p}{p}$$\n\nNow, substitute the given numerical values for the parameters $W_0$, $C_S$, and $G_S$:\n$$120 - 180p = 30 \\frac{1-p}{p}$$\n\nTo solve for $p$, we first eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by $p$.

A stable equilibrium is an attracting point: if the frequency $p$ is slightly perturbed from this value, it will tend to return to it. An unstable equilibrium is a repelling point: any small perturbation will cause the frequency to move away from it.\n\nWe can determine stability by examining the fitness difference, $\\Delta W(p) = W_S(p) - W_T(p)$. If $\\Delta W(p) > 0$, the sneaker strategy is more successful, and $p$ will increase. If $\\Delta W(p)  0$, the territorial strategy is more successful, and $p$ will decrease.\n\nA stable equilibrium $p^*$ will have $\\Delta W(p) > 0$ for $p  p^*$ and $\\Delta W(p)  0$ for $p > p^*$ in its immediate vicinity.\n\nLet's test the regions around our two solutions, $p = 1/3$ and $p = 1/2$.\nThe function for the fitness difference is $\\Delta W(p) = 30\\frac{1-p}{p} - (120 - 180p)$.\n\n1.  **Test a point between the two equilibria**, for example, $p = 0.4$ (which is between $1/3 \\approx 0.333$ and $1/2 = 0.5$).\n    $$\\Delta W(0.4) = 30 \\frac{1-0.4}{0.4} - (120 - 180 \\cdot 0.4)$$\n    $$\\Delta W(0.4) = 30 \\frac{0.6}{0.4} - (120 - 72)$$\n    $$\\Delta W(0.4) = 30 \\cdot 1.5 - 48$$\n    $$\\Delta W(0.4) = 45 - 48 = -3$$\n    Since $\\Delta W(0.4)  0$, the frequency $p$ will tend to decrease from $p=0.4$ towards $p=1/3$. This suggests that $p=1/3$ is a stable equilibrium and $p=1/2$ is an unstable one.\n\n2.  **Test a point below $p = 1/3$**, for example, $p = 0.25$.\n    $$\\Delta W(0.25) = 30 \\frac{1-0.25}{0.25} - (120 - 180 \\cdot 0.25)$$\n    $$\\Delta W(0.25) = 30 \\frac{0.75}{0.25} - (120 - 45)$$\n    $$\\Delta W(0.25) = 30 \\cdot 3 - 75$$\n    $$\\Delta W(0.25) = 90 - 75 = 15$$\n    Since $\\Delta W(0.25) > 0$, the frequency $p$ will tend to increase from $p=0.25$ towards $p=1/3$.\n\nThe analysis shows that for $p  1/3$, $p$ increases, and for $1/3  p  1/2$, $p$ decreases. This confirms that $p = 1/3$ is a stable equilibrium point, as the population frequency will converge to this value from either side (within the $0$ to $1/2$ range). Conversely, $p = 1/2$ is an unstable equilibrium because if $p$ deviates slightly below $1/2$, it will decrease further away towards $1/3$. If $p$ deviates slightly above $1/2$, the fitness difference becomes positive again, and $p$ would increase away from $1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the stable equilibrium frequency of sneaker males is $1/3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "2314533"}, {"introduction": "To fully understand social behavior, biologists investigate both its ultimate (evolutionary) function and its proximate (mechanistic) basis.

By analyzing the data from pharmacological manipulations, you will learn to apply the critical concepts of necessity and sufficiency, a powerful logical framework for establishing causal links between biology and behavior.", "problem": "In many animal species, the outcome of a previous aggressive encounter can influence future performance. A well-documented example is the \"winner effect\" in male field crickets (*Gryllus bimaculatus*), where an individual that has recently won a fight is significantly more likely to win its next fight. A leading hypothesis proposes a proximate physiological mechanism involving the neuromodulator octopamine, which is the invertebrate analog of norepinephrine. This hypothesis states that octopamine signaling is a key mediator of the behavioral changes associated with the winner effect.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, a researcher conducts a controlled experiment. Male crickets are divided into four groups. After the treatment, each cricket is paired with a standardized, \"naÃ¯ve\" opponent (one with no recent fighting experience), and the outcome of the fight is recorded. The experimental groups and their results are as follows:\n\n*   **Group 1 (Winner-Saline):** Crickets are staged to win a fight against a smaller opponent. Immediately after the win, they are injected with a saline solution. In subsequent fights, this group wins 85% of the time.\n*   **Group 2 (Winner-Antagonist):** Crickets are staged to win a fight against a smaller opponent. Immediately after the win, they are injected with a potent octopamine receptor antagonist, a chemical that blocks octopamine from binding to its receptors. In subsequent fights, this group wins 52% of the time.\n*   **Group 3 (NaÃ¯ve-Saline):** Crickets with no prior fighting experience (\"naÃ¯ve\") are injected with a saline solution. In subsequent fights, this group wins 50% of the time.\n*   **Group 4 (NaÃ¯ve-Agonist):** NaÃ¯ve crickets are injected with a potent octopamine receptor agonist, a chemical that mimics the effect of octopamine. In subsequent fights, this group wins 83% of the time.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following conclusions regarding the role of octopamine in the cricket winner effect is the most strongly supported?\n\nA. The results support the hypothesis that octopamine signaling is both necessary for the expression of the winner effect after a victory and sufficient to induce a winner-like state in naÃ¯ve individuals.\n\nB. The results demonstrate that octopamine is necessary for the winner effect, but a prior win is also required to prime an individual, as activating octopamine signaling alone in a naÃ¯ve cricket is insufficient to increase its win probability.\n\nC. The results indicate that the winner effect is a purely behavioral phenomenon independent of octopamine, as the saline-injected winners maintained a high win rate. The changes observed in other groups are likely due to non-specific side effects of the drugs.\n\nD. The results suggest that octopamine is sufficient to induce a winner-like state but is not necessary for the natural winner effect, which likely relies on a different physiological pathway.\n\nE. The results show that octopamine signaling is inhibitory to aggression, and removing its influence via an antagonist is what allows the winner effect to manifest.", "solution": "We aim to determine whether octopamine signaling is necessary and/or sufficient for the winner effect. For causal evaluation:\n- \"Necessary\" means that blocking octopamine signaling after a win should abolish the elevated win probability relative to baseline.\n- \"Sufficient\" means that activating octopamine signaling in a naÃ¯ve individual (without prior wins) should elevate win probability to a winner-like level relative to baseline.\n\nStep 1: Establish the baseline. Group 3 (NaÃ¯ve-Saline) exhibits a win probability of 0.50. This serves as the baseline for untreated or control-like behavior.\n\nStep 2: Verify the natural winner effect under control conditions. Group 1 (Winner-Saline) shows an elevated win probability of 0.85 relative to the baseline 0.50, confirming the winner effect under normal physiological signaling.\n\nStep 3: Test necessity by blocking octopamine after a win. Group 2 (Winner-Antagonist) shows a win probability of 0.52, which is essentially at baseline (0.50) and far below 0.85. This indicates that blocking octopamine receptors prevents the expression of the elevated win rate that characterizes the winner effect. Therefore, octopamine signaling is necessary for the expression of the winner effect following a prior victory.\n\nStep 4: Test sufficiency by activating octopamine in naÃ¯ve individuals. Group 4 (NaÃ¯ve-Agonist) shows a win probability of 0.83, which is elevated relative to the baseline 0.50 and closely matches the winner-saline level of 0.85. This demonstrates that activating octopamine signaling alone, in the absence of any prior win, induces a winner-like state. Therefore, octopamine signaling is sufficient to induce the behavioral phenotype associated with the winner effect.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate alternatives against the data.\n- Option B claims agonist is insufficient, which contradicts the 0.83 result in naÃ¯ve-agonist crickets.\n- Option C claims independence from octopamine, which is contradicted by the loss of the effect with the antagonist (0.52).\n- Option D claims sufficiency but not necessity; the antagonist result shows necessity.\n- Option E claims octopamine is inhibitory; the data show octopamine facilitates higher win probability, and blocking it reduces the elevated win rate.\n\nConclusion: The data support that octopamine signaling is both necessary for the expression of the winner effect after a victory and sufficient to induce a winner-like state in naÃ¯ve crickets.
