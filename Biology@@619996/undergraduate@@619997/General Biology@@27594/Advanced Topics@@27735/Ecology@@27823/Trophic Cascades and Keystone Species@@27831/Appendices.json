By selectively removing a single species, ecologists can uncover its true, often disproportionate, influence on the surrounding community. This practice [@problem_id:1773323] challenges you to think like a marine ecologist, interpreting data from a simulated exclusion experiment to see how a predatory crab prevents a dominant mussel from taking over, thereby maintaining local biodiversity.", "problem": "A marine ecologist is investigating the community structure of a rocky intertidal zone. The ecologist hypothesizes that a specific species of predatory crab, *Carcinus vastator*, is a keystone species. The hypothesis posits that *C. vastator*'s predation on a competitively dominant species of mussel, *Mytilus dominus*, is crucial for maintaining biodiversity by preventing the mussel from monopolizing the limited rock-face habitat.\n\nTo test this, the ecologist sets up a number of 1 mÂ² plots. Half of these are designated as control plots, which are left open and accessible to the crabs. The other half are exclusion plots, which are covered by cages with a mesh size that prevents adult *C. vastator* from entering but is large enough to allow free water flow and the passage of planktonic larvae of all species, including the mussels.\n\nAt the beginning of the experiment (time t=0), the ecological conditions in all plots were assessed and found to be statistically similar. The average species richness (the number of distinct species of macroinvertebrates and algae) was 14, and the percentage of rock surface covered by the mussel *Mytilus dominus* was 25%.\n\nAfter 36 months, the plots were surveyed again with the following results:\n- **Control plots (crabs present):** The average species richness was 13, and the average mussel cover was 30%.\n- **Exclusion plots (crabs absent):** The average species richness had fallen to 4, and the average mussel cover had increased to 92%.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following ecological principles is most directly and comprehensively demonstrated by the role of the crab, *Carcinus vastator*, in this ecosystem?\n\nA. Keystone predation\n\nB. Trophic cascade\n\nC. Competitive exclusion\n\nD. Resource partitioning\n\nE. Bottom-up control", "solution": "We begin by identifying the experimental design: two treatments differing only in predator presence. At time $t=0$, both treatments are statistically similar, with species richness equal to $14$ and mussel cover equal to $0.25$. After $36$ months, in the control plots with crabs present, richness is $13$ and mussel cover is $0.30$, i.e., little change. In the exclusion plots without crabs, richness declines to $4$ and mussel cover increases to $0.92$. Because the only systematic difference between treatments is predator access, the observed divergence is attributable to the presence versus absence of the predatory crab.\n\nSpace on rock is a limiting resource in intertidal systems, and the mussel is a competitively dominant space monopolist. The dramatic increase of mussel cover from $0.25$ to $0.92$ in exclusion plots indicates competitive release of the dominant species when the predator is absent. The concomitant collapse of species richness from $14$ to $4$ indicates that most other species are excluded as the mussel monopolizes space. In contrast, where the crab is present, mussel cover remains moderate and species richness remains high, indicating that crab predation limits the dominant competitor and thereby maintains diversity.\n\nThis mechanism matches the definition of keystone predation: a predator disproportionately reduces the abundance of a competitively dominant prey, thereby preventing competitive exclusion and maintaining higher community diversity. The role of the crab directly and comprehensively demonstrates this principle.\n\nWe evaluate alternatives:\n- Trophic cascade (top-down effects propagating across multiple trophic levels) may also occur, but the most direct and comprehensive principle shown here is the predator maintaining diversity by suppressing the dominant competitor, i.e., keystone predation.\n- Competitive exclusion is the process observed within exclusion plots by the mussel excluding others, but the question asks for the principle demonstrated by the role of the crab, which is to prevent that outcome; thus keystone predation is the correct principle.\n- Resource partitioning is not evidenced, as no niche partitioning among coexisting species is demonstrated.\n- Bottom-up control is not supported, as the primary driver is predator presence, indicating top-down control rather than limitation by primary resources.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is keystone predation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1773323"}, {"introduction": "Sometimes, the most significant 'predator' isn't an animal, but a disease. When such a powerful regulating factor is removed from an ecosystem, the consequences for a population can be dramatic and swift. This exercise [@problem_id:2325133] provides a quantitative look at this phenomenon, asking you to apply the logistic growth model to calculate how a herbivore population responds and grows towards its new, vegetation-limited carrying capacity, $K_{veg}$. It is a tangible way to model the large-scale impacts of removing a key population regulator.", "problem": "In a large, isolated African savanna, the population of wild herbivores is primarily regulated by two factors: the availability of vegetation and a parasitic disease transmitted by tsetse flies. Under natural conditions with the flies present, the ecosystem reached a stable equilibrium where the herbivore population density was maintained at a carrying capacity, which we will call $K_{parasite}$, of 450 herbivores per square kilometer.\n\nAn ambitious conservation project successfully eradicates the entire tsetse fly population from this region, thereby eliminating the parasitic disease as a limiting factor for the herbivores. In the absence of this disease, the herbivore population's growth is determined solely by the available vegetation. Scientists estimate that the new carrying capacity of the savanna, $K_{veg}$, is 1800 herbivores per square kilometer. The herbivore population is observed to have an intrinsic rate of increase, $r$, of $0.30 \\text{ year}^{-1}$. The population's expansion towards this new, higher carrying capacity can be described by the logistic growth model.\n\nAssuming the eradication of the tsetse flies was instantaneous at time $t=0$, calculate the population density of the herbivores 8 years after the eradication program was completed. Express your answer in herbivores per square kilometer, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $N(t)$ denote the herbivore population density at time $t$ (in years) after the eradication. With the tsetse flies removed, population dynamics follow the logistic model:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = r N \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the intrinsic rate of increase and $K$ is the carrying capacity determined by vegetation alone. The standard solution to this differential equation, obtained by separation of variables and partial fractions, is\n$$\nN(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + C \\exp(-r t)},\n$$\nwhere the constant $C$ is determined by the initial condition $N(0)=N_{0}$:\n$$\nN(0) = \\frac{K}{1 + C} = N_{0} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; C = \\frac{K - N_{0}}{N_{0}}.\n$$\nAt $t=0$, the population was at the previous equilibrium with parasites, so $N_{0} = K_{\\text{parasite}} = 450$.

Ecosystem Engineer", "solution": "We identify the ecological mechanisms at play from the described observations. The reintroduction of the Crested Hawk does not cause a large reduction in the Field Vole population size, but it alters vole foraging behavior: voles avoid open fields and remain near shrubs. This is a nonconsumptive, trait-mediated effect often called a landscape of fear, where predators change prey behavior rather than strongly reducing prey density. As a consequence, the Sunpetal Clover recovers in the open fields that voles now avoid, indicating an indirect positive effect of the predator on the plant via altered herbivory pressure. This is a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade, a form of top-down control.\n\nA keystone species is defined as a species whose impact on community structure and ecosystem processes is disproportionately large relative to its abundance, often via trophic cascades. Keystone predators can drive strong community changes even when prey density does not collapse, particularly through trait-mediated effects that alter prey habitat use and feeding.\n\nWe evaluate alternatives:\n- Indicator species: used to assess environmental conditions; not supported by the scenario.\n- Apex predator: while the hawk may be high on the food chain, the term is less precise about the specific role of driving community structure via a cascade; the defining observation is the cascade effect, not merely trophic position.\n- Foundation species: typically abundant primary producers or habitat-formers (e.g., corals, trees); does not apply.\n- Ecosystem engineer: modifies the physical environment (e.g., beavers); not indicated here.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate ecological term describing the role of the Crested Hawk given the observed behaviorally mediated trophic cascade and disproportionate community effect is keystone species.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2325175"}]}
