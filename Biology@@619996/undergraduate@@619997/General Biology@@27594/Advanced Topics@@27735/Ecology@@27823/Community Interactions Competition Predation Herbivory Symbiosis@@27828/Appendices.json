Assume the total lifetime energy assimilated by any individual plant is $E_{total}$. The mainland variant allocates a fraction $c = 0.35$ of this energy to chemical defenses. The remaining energy is converted into seeds, and the number of viable seeds produced is directly proportional to this remaining energy. The island variant, lacking these defenses, allocates no energy to their production.\n\nBoth populations are now introduced in equal numbers as seedlings into a new, controlled environment that is identical to the mainland habitat and contains the ancestral herbivore. In this environment, the presence of the chemical defenses provides the mainland variant a baseline survival probability to reproductive maturity of $p_s = 0.80$. Due to its lack of defenses, the island variant is much more vulnerable to herbivory, and its survival probability is reduced by a factor of $k = 4.0$ compared to the mainland variant.\n\nAssuming both populations start with an equal number of seedlings, calculate the ratio of the total number of viable seeds produced by the entire island population to the total number of viable seeds produced by the entire mainland population after one full generation.
