A fundamental principle of this flow is that energy transfer between trophic levels is inherently inefficient, with a large fraction lost at each step. This exercise provides a hands-on calculation of this energy cascade, asking you to apply a specific trophic efficiency to a simplified food web model. By working through this problem [@problem_id:2291633], you will gain a quantitative understanding of why food chains are typically short and why there is less energy available at higher trophic levels.", "problem": "An ecological research team is modeling the energy flow in a simplified coastal estuary food web. The base of this food web is composed of phytoplankton, which are the primary producers. The team has determined that the net primary productivity (NPP) of the phytoplankton in this ecosystem is 6,250 kilocalories per square meter per year (kcal/(m²·year)).\n\nIn this model, the primary consumers are zooplankton that feed exclusively on the phytoplankton. The secondary consumers are small fish that feed exclusively on the zooplankton. The energy transfer between successive trophic levels, known as trophic efficiency, is assumed to be a constant 14.0% for this particular system.\n\nCalculate the amount of energy that is available to the secondary consumer trophic level (the small fish).
