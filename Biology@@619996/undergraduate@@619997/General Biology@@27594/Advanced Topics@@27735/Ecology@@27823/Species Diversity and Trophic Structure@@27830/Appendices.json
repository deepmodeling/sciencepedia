{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To understand an ecological community, simply counting the number of species (richness) is not enough; we must also consider their relative abundances (evenness). This exercise introduces powerful tools for quantifying biodiversity, the Shannon-Wiener Index ($H$) and Pielou's Evenness Index ($J$), which help capture these nuances. By applying these indices to a hypothetical old-growth forest and a recovering forest, you will practice translating raw species counts into meaningful ecological insights about the effects of disturbance and succession [@problem_id:2314950].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying plant community structure in two different temperate forest plots of the same size, designated Community Alpha and Community Beta. Community Alpha is located in a protected, old-growth forest, while Community Beta is in an area that was clear-cut 15 years ago and is now undergoing secondary succession. The ecologist conducts a census and records the number of individuals for each plant species present. Both communities are found to contain exactly 10 species.\n\nThe abundance data are as follows:\n- **Community Alpha**: The number of individuals for the 10 species are 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 20, 19, 18, 17, and 16.\n- **Community Beta**: The number of individuals for the 10 species are 105, 30, 15, 11, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3.\n\nTo quantify and compare the diversity of these two communities, you will use two standard ecological indices. The Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index, $H$, is calculated as:\n$$H = -\\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln(p_i)$$\nwhere $S$ is the species richness (the total number of species), and $p_i$ is the proportion of individuals belonging to the $i$-th species.\n\nThe species evenness can be measured by Pielou's Evenness Index, $J$, which is calculated as:\n$$J = \\frac{H}{H_{\\text{max}}}$$\nwhere $H_{\\text{max}} = \\ln(S)$. This index $J$ is constrained between 0 and 1, where 1 represents a situation where all species are present in equal numbers.\n\nBased on an analysis of these two communities using the provided data and formulae, which of the following statements provides the most accurate ecological interpretation?\n\nA. Community Alpha exhibits lower evenness than Community Beta, a pattern consistent with niche preemption by a dominant competitor in stable environments.\n\nB. Community Beta is more diverse and more even than Community Alpha, which is characteristic of a mid-successional stage where competitive exclusion has not yet occurred.\n\nC. The strong dominance by one species and resulting low evenness in Community Beta are characteristic of an early successional community recovering from a major disturbance.\n\nD. The high evenness observed in Community Alpha suggests a lack of significant interspecific competition, allowing many species to coexist at similar population sizes.\n\nE. A valid comparison is impossible because the total number of individuals sampled in Community Alpha is different from that in Community Beta.", "solution": "We are given two communities, each with species richness $S=10$, and species-abundance counts.

Option B is false (Beta is neither more diverse nor more even). Option D is not well supported ecologically; high evenness does not imply a lack of interspecific competition. Option E is false; totals are equal and, even if different, Shannon and Pielou indices allow valid comparisons of diversity and evenness.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is the one describing strong dominance and low evenness in Community Beta as characteristic of early succession following disturbance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2314950"}, {"introduction": "Ecosystems are defined by the intricate web of feeding relationships that channel energy and nutrients from producers to consumers. Many ecosystems, such as coastal estuaries, are not self-contained; they rely heavily on external, or 'allochthonous', inputs of organic matter that subsidize the food web. This practice problem challenges you to map out a complex food web with both internal and external energy pathways and to reason through the cascading, system-wide consequences of severing one of these crucial links [@problem_id:2315004].", "problem": "Consider a simplified coastal estuary ecosystem where the food web is structured by both internal (autochthonous) primary production and external (allochthonous) nutrient inputs. The specific trophic links are as follows:\n\n1.  Phytoplankton form the base of the autochthonous food chain and are consumed by zooplankton.\n2.  A nearby river provides a significant allochthonous input in the form of organic detritus. This detritus settles on the estuary floor.\n3.  Benthic polychaete worms are deposit-feeders, consuming the settled organic detritus.\n4.  Filter-feeding bivalves (e.g., clams) consume both phytoplankton and suspended particles of the same river-borne detritus from the water column.\n5.  Small forage fish feed exclusively on zooplankton.\n6.  Migratory shorebirds feed primarily on the benthic polychaete worms.\n7.  A larger predatory fish, the estuarine grouper, has a diet consisting of small forage fish and bivalves.\n8.  Ospreys are the apex predators in this system, preying exclusively on the estuarine grouper.\n\nSuppose a new hydroelectric dam is constructed far upstream on the river, which significantly reduces the flow of water and traps the vast majority of organic detritus before it can reach the estuary. Assuming this is the only major change to the system, which of the following describes the most likely long-term outcome for the populations of the top predators in this food web?\n\nA. The osprey population will be unaffected because its food source, the estuarine grouper, primarily relies on the phytoplankton-based food chain.\n\nB. The shorebird population will decline, but the osprey population is likely to increase due to a greater abundance of forage fish.\n\nC. Both the shorebird and osprey populations are likely to decline.\n\nD. The shorebird population will increase due to competitive release, while the osprey population will decline.\n\nE. Both the shorebird and osprey populations will be largely unaffected, as the system will shift to rely entirely on phytoplankton production.", "solution": "I will analyze the food web using bottom-up control and trophic subsidy principles, tracing how the loss of the allochthonous detrital input propagates through the network and affects the top predators (shorebirds and ospreys).\n\n1. Identify the two basal energy pathways:\n- Autochthonous pathway: phytoplankton $\\to$ zooplankton $\\to$ small forage fish $\\to$ estuarine grouper $\\to$ osprey.\n- Allochthonous detrital pathway: river detritus (settled) $\\to$ benthic polychaete worms $\\to$ shorebirds; and river detritus (suspended) plus phytoplankton $\\to$ bivalves $\\to$ estuarine grouper.\n\n2. Specify the perturbation:\n- The dam traps most river-borne organic detritus. By the problem’s assumption, this is the only major change. Therefore, the autochthonous phytoplankton-based chain is not directly reduced by the dam, while the allochthonous detrital subsidy is strongly reduced.\n\n3. Immediate bottom-up effects of detritus loss:\n- Settled detritus decline reduces the resource base for deposit-feeding polychaetes. Polychaete abundance declines due to reduced food supply.\n- Suspended detritus declines reduce an important food source for bivalves. Although bivalves can still feed on phytoplankton, the loss of a major portion of their mixed diet decreases their total energy intake and likely lowers their carrying capacity and abundance.\n\n4. Consequences for mid-trophic consumers:\n- Shorebirds feed primarily on polychaete worms; with worms declining, shorebird food availability decreases, leading to a shorebird population decline over the long term.\n- Estuarine grouper feed on both bivalves and small forage fish. With bivalves declining, grouper lose one prey guild and a substantial energy channel (the detrital pathway). Even if forage fish do not decline, the reduction in total available prey and energy input to the grouper is expected to reduce grouper carrying capacity and abundance.\n\n5. Possible compensatory dynamics and why they likely do not reverse the conclusion:\n- It is possible that a reduction in bivalve grazing pressure could increase phytoplankton, potentially boosting zooplankton and forage fish. However, this indirect pathway is uncertain and may be insufficient to compensate for the complete loss or strong reduction of the grouper’s bivalve prey and the collapse of the entire detritus-fueled benthic pathway. Moreover, grouper rely on a diversified diet including bivalves; losing that prey reduces their resilience and total intake options, making a net decline more likely.\n- Thus, even if forage fish increase somewhat, the grouper’s overall prey base shrinks, favoring a decline.\n\n6. Top predators’ outcomes:\n- Shorebirds: Decline due to reduced polychaete prey caused by detritus loss.\n- Ospreys: Decline due to reduced grouper abundance, as grouper lose a major prey guild and energy pathway, lowering their population and thereby osprey food availability.\n\nTherefore, the most likely long-term outcome is that both the shorebird and osprey populations decline.\n\nHence, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2315004"}, {"introduction": "The flow of energy is a fundamental constraint on the structure of any ecosystem, forming a pyramid where available energy diminishes at each successive trophic level.
