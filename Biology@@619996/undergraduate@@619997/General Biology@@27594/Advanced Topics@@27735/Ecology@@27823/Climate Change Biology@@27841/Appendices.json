The tree's ability to transport water is limited by the tension the water column in the xylem can withstand before catastrophic embolism (cavitation) occurs. This failure point is characterized by a critical xylem pressure potential, $P_{crit}$.\n\nDuring a prolonged drought, the soil water potential, $\\Psi_{soil}$, is stable at a low value. To draw water from the soil to its full height, $h$, the tree must overcome both the low soil water potential and the force of gravity. Additionally, transpiration, which is necessary for photosynthesis, creates a frictional drag that further lowers the water potential. For this species under midday sun, the additional potential drop required to overcome this hydraulic drag, $\\Delta\\Psi_{drag}$, is found to be well-approximated by a linear function of the ambient temperature: $\\Delta\\Psi_{drag} = k \\cdot T_C$, where $T_C$ is the temperature in degrees Celsius and $k$ is a coefficient that combines factors of hydraulic resistance and evaporative demand.\n\nCatastrophic embolism occurs when the water potential in the uppermost xylem ($\\Psi_{xylem, top}$) drops to the critical value, $P_{crit}$. Assume that $\\Psi_{xylem, top}$ is equal to the total water potential required at the leaf level to pull water from the soil against gravity and drag.\n\nUsing the parameters below, calculate the critical ambient temperature in degrees Celsius at which this tree is at immediate risk of catastrophic xylem embolism.\n\nGiven Parameters:\n- Tree height, $h = 80.0 \\text{ m}$\n- Soil water potential, $\\Psi_{soil} = -0.80 \\text{ MPa}$\n- Critical xylem pressure potential, $P_{crit} = -3.50 \\text{ MPa}$\n- Drag coefficient, $k = 0.0500 \\text{ MPa} \\cdot {}^{\\circ}\\text{C}^{-1}$\n\nPhysical Constants:\n- Density of water, $\\rho = 1000 \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}$\n- Acceleration due to gravity, $g = 9.81 \\text{ m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$\n\nProvide your answer in degrees Celsius, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Principle: In steady vertical flow, the leaf water potential must be low enough to overcome the soil-to-leaf potential drops due to gravity and hydraulic drag.

Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of one genotype to produce more than one phenotype when exposed to different environments.

After 50 generations, the biologists observe that snails from Population W have a significantly higher tolerance to acute heat stress than snails from Population C.\n\nTo determine whether this increased tolerance is due to phenotypic plasticity, evolutionary adaptation, or a combination of both, they conduct a \"common garden\" experiment. They collect eggs from both Population C and Population W. For each population, half of the eggs are raised to adulthood in a $20\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ environment, and the other half are raised in a $28\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ environment.
