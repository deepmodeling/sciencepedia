For very small populations, the random fortunes of individual births and deaths—a concept known as demographic stochasticity—can have dramatic consequences. This exercise [@problem_id:1874430] provides a stark illustration of this risk, asking you to calculate the probability of a newly founded population producing only male offspring. While an extreme scenario, it powerfully highlights how random chance can steer a small population toward an immediate dead end, a fundamental concern in conservation breeding and reintroduction programs.", "problem": "A conservation team has successfully established a new, isolated population of the critically endangered Azure Warbler on a protected island. The founding population consists of exactly six breeding pairs. From extensive studies on the mainland population, it is known that each breeding pair that successfully nests will raise exactly two offspring to the fledgling stage in a given breeding season. We will assume all six pairs successfully nest in the first season. The sex of each individual offspring is determined independently and is equally likely to be male or female.\n\nThe long-term viability of this new population is of great concern. One of the immediate risks is demographic stochasticity, particularly an unfavorable sex ratio in the first generation of offspring. Calculate the probability that all offspring produced by these six pairs in the first breeding season are male. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "Each of the six breeding pairs produces exactly two offspring, giving a total number of offspring\n$$N=6\\times 2=12.$$\nThe sex of each offspring is determined independently with probability\n$$P(\\text{male})=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(\\text{female})=\\frac{1}{2}.$$\nThe event that all offspring are male is the intersection of $12$ independent events, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.

This principle, a cornerstone of Population Viability Analysis, is explored in this practice [@problem_id:1874399], which deals with environmental stochasticity. You will discover the counterintuitive but vital concept that high year-to-year environmental variance can depress the long-term growth rate, a potential to drive a population to extinction even if its arithmetic average growth rate is positive. This calculation reveals why stability can be just as crucial as average performance for survival.", "problem": "A team of conservation biologists is conducting a Population Viability Analysis (PVA) for a newly discovered species, the Saffron-crested Manakin, a small bird inhabiting a remote tropical island. The island's climate is subject to significant inter-annual variability, leading to large fluctuations in the availability of key food resources.\n\nOver a decade of study, the biologists have determined that the arithmetic mean of the instantaneous population growth rate is $r = 0.03$ per year. This positive average suggests the population should be growing. However, the environmental fluctuations cause a large variance in this growth rate, which has been quantified as $\\sigma_e^2 = 0.08$ per year-squared.\n\nIn stochastic environments, the long-term viability of a population is not determined by its arithmetic mean growth rate alone. A more accurate predictor is the long-term instantaneous growth rate, which accounts for the year-to-year variability. A negative value for this long-term rate implies that the population is on a trajectory toward extinction, despite the positive short-term average.\n\nAs a consultant for the conservation team, you are tasked with calculating this crucial metric. Calculate the approximate long-term instantaneous growth rate for the Saffron-crested Manakin population.
