To compare the biodiversity of different habitats, such as an undisturbed old-growth forest and a reforested plot, simply counting the number of species is not enough.

The primary metric for success is the recovery of species diversity. To this end, the biologist samples two square plots of identical size: Plot A is located in a mature, undisturbed old-growth forest, while Plot B is in an area that was clear-cut 20 years ago and subsequently reforested. The biologist counts the number of individual trees for five dominant species in each plot.\n\nThe data collected is as follows:\n- In Plot A (Mature Forest), the counts are: 95 American Beech, 88 Sugar Maple, 105 Eastern Hemlock, 82 Yellow Birch, and 91 White Ash.\n- In Plot B (Restored Forest), the counts are: 45 American Beech, 38 Sugar Maple, 250 Eastern White Pine, 35 Yellow Birch, and 32 White Ash. Note that Eastern White Pine is a fast-growing pioneer species often used in reforestation, which was not dominant in the mature plot's sample. For the purpose of this analysis, it is treated as a distinct species in the community.\n\nTo quantify and compare the biodiversity, the biologist uses the Shannon diversity index ($H'$), defined as:\n$$H' = -\\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln(p_i)$$\nwhere $S$ is the total number of species (species richness) and $p_i$ is the proportion of individuals belonging to the $i$-th species.\n\nCalculate the absolute difference between the Shannon diversity index of the mature forest (Plot A) and the restored forest (Plot B).

By modeling how the absence of certain species in fragmented habitats alters disease prevalence in ticks [@problem_id:2288271], you will gain valuable skills in analyzing the indirect and often hidden consequences of threats to biodiversity.", "problem": "Ecologists are studying the epidemiology of a tick-borne pathogen in two distinct environments: a large, contiguous forest and a series of small, isolated forest fragments. The pathogen is transmitted by ticks, which acquire it by feeding on infected vertebrate hosts. The ecosystem contains two types of hosts relevant to the pathogen's life cycle: a Primary Reservoir Host (PRH), which is highly effective at transmitting the pathogen to feeding ticks, and an Alternate Host (AH), which is a very poor transmitter.\n\nIn the large forest, the ecosystem is intact and supports populations of both host types as well as natural predators of the PRH. In the small fragments, the habitat size is insufficient to support predator populations or the Alternate Host species. The absence of predators in the fragments leads to a higher population density of the Primary Reservoir Host, a phenomenon known as \"mesopredator release\".\n\nAssume the following for your model:\n1.  Uninfected ticks feed on the available hosts (PRH and AH) in direct proportion to the hosts' relative population sizes within a given environment.\n2.  The \"reservoir competence\" is the probability that an uninfected tick will become infected after taking a single blood meal from a host of a given species.\n3.
