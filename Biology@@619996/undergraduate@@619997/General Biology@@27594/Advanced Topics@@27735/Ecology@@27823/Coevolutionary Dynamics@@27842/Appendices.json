This hypothetical scenario involving a deceptive orchid and its wasp pollinator [@problem_id:2287236] allows us to model such a trade-off quantitatively. By constructing simple fitness equations, we can determine the precise conditions under which a discriminating strategy, despite its own costs, is favored by selection over a non-discriminating one.", "problem": "In a particular ecosystem, a species of hammer orchid has coevolved with a species of thynnid wasp. The orchid does not produce nectar but has evolved to mimic the appearance and, more importantly, the species-specific mating pheromones of the female thynnid wasp. Male wasps are drawn to the orchids and attempt to mate with them, a behavior known as pseudocopulation. During this process, the male inadvertently picks up the orchid's pollen sacs, which he then transfers to the next orchid he visits, thus pollinating it.\n\nThis deceptive strategy places a strong selective pressure on the male wasps. Consider a simplified genetic model for the male wasp's ability to discern the orchid's mimicry. A single gene controls this trait, with two alleles:\n\n-   **Allele N (Non-discriminator):** Males with this allele respond to a broader range of pheromone signals. They are unable to distinguish between a real female wasp and a deceptive orchid. They will attempt to mate with either upon encounter.\n-   **Allele D (Discriminator):** Males with this allele have evolved a highly specific response to the precise pheromone profile of female wasps. They can perfectly distinguish and will ignore the orchids. However, this high specificity comes at a cost: there is a chance they might fail to recognize a real female if her pheromone signature varies slightly from the ideal.\n\nLet's quantify the evolutionary trade-offs. Define the following parameters:\n-   `B`: The fitness benefit (in arbitrary units) gained from a successful mating with a female wasp. `B > 0`.\n-   `C`: The fitness cost (in the same units) incurred from attempting to mate with an orchid. This cost represents wasted time, energy, and potential predation risk. `C > 0`.\n-   `p`: The proportion of scent-emitting entities in the environment that are deceptive orchids. Consequently, `1-p` is the proportion that are actual female wasps. `0  p  1`.\n-   `q`: The probability that a Discriminator (D) male fails to recognize and thus fails to mate with a real female wasp upon encounter, due to its stringent recognition criteria. `0  q  1`. A Non-discriminator (N) male is assumed to never fail in this way.\n\nAssuming that natural selection acts to maximize the average fitness gain per encounter, under which of the following conditions will the Discriminator allele (D) be favored over the Non-discriminator allele (N) and therefore tend to increase in frequency in the wasp population?\n\nA. $p > \\frac{qB}{C + qB}$\n\nB. $p  \\frac{qB}{C + qB}$\n\nC. $p > \\frac{qC}{B+C}$\n\nD. $p > \\frac{B(1-q)}{C}$\n\nE. $p  \\frac{C}{B(1-q)}$", "solution": "To determine the condition under which the Discriminator allele (D) is favored, we must compare the expected fitness outcomes for males carrying each allele. The allele with the higher expected fitness will be selected for. We can calculate the expected fitness change per encounter for each type of male.\n\nLet $W_N$ be the expected fitness change for a Non-discriminator (N) male from a single random encounter with a scent-emitting entity.\nA Non-discriminator male cannot distinguish between orchids and females.\n-   With probability $p$, the male encounters an orchid. This results in an unsuccessful mating attempt and incurs a fitness cost of $C$. The fitness change is $-C$.\n-   With probability $1-p$, the male encounters a real female. By the problem's definition, the Non-discriminator never fails to recognize a real female, so this encounter results in a successful mating, yielding a fitness benefit of $B$. The fitness change is $+B$.\n\nThe total expected fitness change for a Non-discriminator male is the sum of these outcomes weighted by their probabilities:\n$W_N = p \\cdot (-C) + (1-p) \\cdot B$\n$W_N = (1-p)B - pC$\n\nNow, let $W_D$ be the expected fitness change for a Discriminator (D) male from a single random encounter.\nA Discriminator male can perfectly identify orchids.\n-   With probability $p$, the male encounters an orchid. It correctly identifies the mimic and ignores it, avoiding the mating attempt. We assume the cost of identification is negligible, so the fitness change is $0$.\n-   With probability $1-p$, the male encounters a real female. However, due to its high specificity, there is a trade-off.\n    -   With a probability of $1-q$, it successfully recognizes the female and mates, gaining the fitness benefit $B$.\n    -   With a probability of $q$, it fails to recognize the female and moves on, resulting in no fitness change (a missed opportunity).\nThe expected fitness change from encountering a female is thus $(1-q)B + q(0) = (1-q)B$.\n\nThe total expected fitness change for a Discriminator male is the sum of these outcomes weighted by their probabilities:\n$W_D = p \\cdot (0) + (1-p) \\cdot [(1-q)B]$\n$W_D = (1-p)(1-q)B$\n\nThe Discriminator allele (D) will be favored by natural selection if the expected fitness for a Discriminator male is greater than the expected fitness for a Non-discriminator male.\n$W_D  W_N$\n$(1-p)(1-q)B  (1-p)B - pC$\n\nNow, we solve this inequality for $p$.\nFirst, expand the terms:\n$(B - pB)(1-q)  B - pB - pC$\n$B - qB - pB + pqB  B - pB - pC$\n\nWe can cancel the $B$ and $-pB$ terms that appear on both sides:\n$-qB + pqB  -pC$\n\nNow, we want to isolate $p$. Let's move all terms with $p$ to one side and the other terms to the other side.\n$pqB + pC  qB$\n\nFactor out $p$ from the left side:\n$p(qB + C)  qB$\n\nSince $B  0$, $C  0$, and $q  0$, the term $(qB + C)$ is strictly positive. Therefore, we can divide both sides by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$p  \\frac{qB}{C + qB}$\n\nThis inequality represents the condition under which the Discriminator allele (D) provides a higher fitness payoff and will be favored by selection.

This exercise [@problem_id:2287248] models that critical first step: the invasion of a new defense allele in a host plant population. We will analyze the fitness of this new defense in the face of a parasite population that may already possess resistance, revealing the delicate balance between the cost of defense, $c$, and the damage from a successful infection, $s$.", "problem": "In a coevolutionary arms race, a species of host plant is targeted by a parasitic dodder plant. The dodder infests the host, significantly reducing its fitness. In response, a defense mechanism has evolved in some host plants. The genetic basis for this interaction can be modeled as follows:\n\n- The host plant population has two alleles at a single locus: a dominant defense allele `D` and a recessive non-defense allele `d`.\n- The parasite population also has two alleles at a corresponding single locus: a dominant resistance allele `R` and a recessive susceptible allele `r`.\n\nThe fitness consequences are defined by the following parameters:\n- The baseline fitness of an unparasitized host plant is normalized to 1.\n- A successful parasitic infestation by a dodder plant of any genotype reduces the host's fitness by a fixed amount `s`, where $0  s  1$.\n- Host plants with at least one `D` allele produce a specific microRNA (miRNA) that is transferred to the parasite. This miRNA silences a gene essential for nutrient absorption in susceptible (`rr`) parasites, rendering the infestation harmless to the host. However, maintaining this defense system incurs a constant metabolic cost, reducing the host's fitness by an amount `c`, where $0  c  s$, regardless of whether the defense is successful.\n- Parasites with at least one `R` allele have a modified target gene that is not recognized by the host's miRNA, making them resistant to the defense. This resistance mechanism has no bearing on the damage `s` they inflict. There is a fitness cost associated with the `R` allele for the parasite, but this information may or may not be relevant to the host's evolution.\n\nConsider a large host population composed entirely of homozygous `dd` individuals, which is fully infested by a large dodder population. Within the parasite population, the frequency of the resistance allele `R` is `p_R` and the frequency of the susceptible allele `r` is `p_r`, such that `p_R + p_r = 1`.\n\nA mutation introduces a single `D` allele into the host population. For this new `D` allele to spread (i.e., for natural selection to favor its increase in frequency when rare), the fitness of a heterozygous `Dd` individual must be greater than the average fitness of the resident `dd` individuals. Determine the maximum possible frequency of the resistance allele `R` in the parasite population, denoted as `p_{R,max}`, for which this invasion condition holds. Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of `s` and `c`.", "solution": "Let the fitness of a resident homozygous non-defense host be the baseline under full infestation. Because every dd host suffers the fixed damage s and pays no defense cost, its fitness is\n$$\nW_{dd}=1-s.\n$$\nFor a rare heterozygous host Dd in the same environment, infestation still occurs. If the infesting parasite is susceptible rr, the hostâ€™s miRNA defense neutralizes the damage but the host pays the defense cost c, yielding fitness $1-c$. If the infesting parasite carries at least one R allele (RR or Rr), the defense fails and the host suffers both the damage s and the cost c, yielding fitness $1-c-s$.\n\nUnder random mating in the parasite (diploid with dominant R), the frequency of susceptible parasites is $p_{rr}=p_{r}^{2}=(1-p_{R})^{2}$, and the frequency carrying at least one R allele is $1-p_{r}^{2}$. Therefore, the expected fitness of a rare Dd host is\n$$\nW_{Dd}=p_{r}^{2}(1-c)+(1-p_{r}^{2})(1-c-s)\n=1-c-s+s\\,p_{r}^{2}\n=1-c-s+s(1-p_{R})^{2}.\n$$\nThe D allele can invade when $W_{Dd}W_{dd}$, namely\n$$\n1-c-s+s(1-p_{R})^{2}1-s\n\\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\;\ns(1-p_{R})^{2}c\n\\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\;\n(1-p_{R})^{2}\\frac{c}{s}.\n$$\nSince $0\\leq p_{R}\\leq 1$, we have $1-p_{R}\\geq 0$, so taking square roots gives\n$$\n1-p_{R}\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{s}}\n\\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\;\np_{R}1-\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{s}}.\n$$\nThus, the maximum resistance-allele frequency in the parasite population compatible with invasion of D is\n$$\np_{R,\\max}=1-\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{s}},\n$$\nwhich lies in the interval $(0,1)$ because $0cs$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1-\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{s}}}$$", "id": "2287248"}, {"introduction": "Coevolution does not always lead to an endless arms race; it can also be a powerful force for maintaining genetic diversity within a species. This practice [@problem_id:2287225] explores a dynamic known as negative frequency-dependent selection, where being rare confers a fitness advantage.

In any given generation, the predator exclusively targets the morph that was the most numerous in the *preceding* generation. If two or three morphs are tied for being the most numerous, the predator would target one of them at random. However, for this specific study, the initial conditions are set up to avoid such ties in the first few generations of interest.\n\nAll morphs have a baseline survival probability of $s_0 = 0.90$ per generation against non-predatory environmental pressures. The morph currently being targeted by the predator experiences an additional mortality, reducing its overall survival probability to $s_p = 0.30$. The non-targeted morphs are completely ignored by the predator and thus their survival is only affected by the baseline environmental pressures, retaining a survival probability of $s_0$.\n\nAfter survival, each remaining insect of every morph produces exactly $k=10$ offspring, and then the parent generation dies.
