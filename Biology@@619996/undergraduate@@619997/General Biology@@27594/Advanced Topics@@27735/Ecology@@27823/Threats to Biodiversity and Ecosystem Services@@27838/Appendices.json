Fish with the genotype `G_F G_F` grow rapidly, reaching the minimum legal catch size in two years. Heterozygous fish (`G_F G_S`) exhibit an intermediate growth rate and reach the legal size in three years. Fish with the `G_S G_S` genotype grow slowly, taking four years to reach legal size.\n\nCod in this population become sexually mature and begin reproducing at the end of their second year, releasing gametes into the water column annually. A commercial fishery operates with a net size that captures all individuals that have reached or exceeded the legal size. This intense fishing pressure occurs just before the annual reproductive season. Consequently, `G_F G_F` individuals are removed before they can reproduce at all. `G_F G_S` individuals reproduce once (at the end of year 2) before being caught at the start of year 3. `G_S G_S` individuals reproduce twice (at the end of years 2 and 3) before being caught at the start of year 4. Assume the number of offspring an individual produces is directly proportional to the number of reproductive seasons it completes before being captured.\n\nInitially, the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and the frequency of the slow-growth allele, `G_S`, is 0.3.
