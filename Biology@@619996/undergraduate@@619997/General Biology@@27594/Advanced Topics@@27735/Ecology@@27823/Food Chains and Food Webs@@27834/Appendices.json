This exercise [@problem_id:2295518] challenges you to think like an ecologist, using isotopic data to reconstruct a food chain from the producer to the apex consumer.", "problem": "An ecologist is investigating the trophic structure of a pristine alpine lake ecosystem. To do this, they use stable isotope analysis, a powerful tool that helps determine the feeding relationships between organisms. The analysis focuses on the ratio of heavy ($^{15}N$) to light ($^{14}N$) nitrogen isotopes, expressed in delta notation as $\\delta^{15}N$ (in parts per thousand, ‰). Due to metabolic processes, there is a predictable enrichment in $\\delta^{15}N$ as one moves up the food chain; an organism's tissues are typically enriched in $^{15}N$ relative to its diet.\n\nThe ecologist collects samples from four dominant species in the lake and measures their average $\\delta^{15}N$ values. The organisms and their corresponding isotope values are listed below:\n\n- Organism A (Planktivorous Minnow): $\\delta^{15}N = 8.8‰$\n- Organism B (Piscivorous Trout): $\\delta^{15}N = 12.1‰$\n- Organism C (Phytoplankton): $\\delta^{15}N = 1.5‰$\n- Organism D (Herbivorous Zooplankton): $\\delta^{15}N = 5.2‰$\n\nBased on these $\\delta^{15}N$ values, determine the correct food chain, starting from the primary producer and ending with the apex consumer in this simplified system.\n\nA.
