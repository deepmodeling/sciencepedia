The actual, true size of this closed population (no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration) is known from a complete census to be 460 individuals. As an exercise in methodology, the ecologist decides to apply the mark-recapture technique.\n\nIn the first phase of the study, the ecologist captures, marks with a small ear tag, and releases $M = 120$ mice. After allowing the mice to reintegrate into the population, a second trapping phase is initiated. However, it is determined that the initial capture experience has induced a \"trap-shy\" behavior. A previously marked mouse is now only half as likely to enter a trap as an unmarked mouse.\n\nIn the second trapping phase, the ecologist captures a total of $C = 100$ mice. The ecologist, being unaware of the trap-shy effect during the initial data processing, uses the standard Lincoln-Peterson estimator. Based on the expected numbers from the second capture, what is the population size estimate that the ecologist will calculate?", "solution": "Let the true population size be $N$, with $M$ marked after the first capture and $C$ individuals caught in the second capture. Under the Lincoln-Petersen method, the estimator used by the ecologist is\n$$\n\\hat{N}=\\frac{M C}{R},\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the number of previously marked individuals recaptured in the second sample.\n\nBecause of trap-shyness, each marked individual in the second capture is only half as likely to be caught as an unmarked individual. Let the relative catchabilities be $w_{m}=\\frac{1}{2}$ for marked and $w_{u}=1$ for unmarked. For a fixed total second-capture size $C$, the expected fraction of marked animals in the catch is proportional to relative catchability times group size, so the expected recaptures are\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[R]=C \\cdot \\frac{w_{m} M}{w_{m} M+w_{u}(N-M)}.\n$$\nSubstituting $w_{m}=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $w_{u}=1$ gives\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[R]=C \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} M}{\\frac{1}{2} M+(N-M)}.\n$$\nWith the given values $N=460$, $M=120$, and $C=100$,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[R]=100 \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 120}{\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 120+(460-120)}=100 \\cdot \\frac{60}{60+340}=100 \\cdot \\frac{60}{400}=15.\n$$\nUsing the Lincoln-Petersen estimator with this expected recapture count, the ecologist will compute\n$$\n\\hat{N}=\\frac{M C}{R}=\\frac{120 \\cdot 100}{15}=800.\n$$\nTherefore, based on the expected numbers from the second capture under trap-shyness but analyzed with the standard estimator, the ecologist will estimate the population size as $800$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{800}$$", "id": "2308645"}, {"introduction": "To predict a population's future, ecologists must look beyond its current size and analyze its demographic structure.
