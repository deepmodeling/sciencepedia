By definition:\n- Chemoautotrophs derive energy from oxidation of inorganic compounds and fix inorganic carbon ($CO_{2}$) as their carbon source; they do not require organic carbon (e.g., glucose).\n- Nitrogen-fixers reduce atmospheric $N_{2}$ to ammonia via nitrogenase. The presence of readily assimilable fixed nitrogen (e.g., $NH_{4}^{+}$ from ammonium chloride) represses nitrogenase and thus prevents selection for active $N_{2}$ fixation.\n- The culture is in complete darkness, so phototrophy (light as energy) is not possible.\n- The flask allows gas exchange with air, supplying $N_{2}$ for nitrogen fixation and $CO_{2}$ for carbon fixation.\n\nEvaluate each option against these constraints:\nA. Glucose as both carbon and energy source selects for heterotrophs and will outcompete chemoautotrophs. Although no fixed nitrogen is added, this does not selectively favor chemoautotrophs; heterotrophic diazotrophs (e.g., aerobic heterotrophs) could grow. This does not meet the chemoautotrophic criterion.\nB. No carbon added is compatible with using $CO_{2}$ from air, but ammonium chloride supplies fixed nitrogen, repressing nitrogenase, and the energy source is light, which is unusable in darkness and not chemoautotrophic. Incorrect.\nC. Glucose plus ammonium chloride selects non-diazotrophic heterotrophs; this is neither chemoautotrophic nor nitrogen-fixing. Incorrect.\nD. No carbon added allows $CO_{2}$ to be the carbon source; no nitrogen added forces reliance on $N_{2}$ fixation; sodium thiosulfate provides an inorganic electron donor for chemolithotrophic energy generation in darkness. This combination selectively favors chemoautotrophic, nitrogen-fixing bacteria (e.g., sulfur-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs capable of $N_{2}$ fixation).\nE. No carbon or nitrogen added is compatible with $CO_{2}$ and $N_{2}$ from air, but light is specified as the energy source, which fails in darkness and is not chemoautotrophic.
