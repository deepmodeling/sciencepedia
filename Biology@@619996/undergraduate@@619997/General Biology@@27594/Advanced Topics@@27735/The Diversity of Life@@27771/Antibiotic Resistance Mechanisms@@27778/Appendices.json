A crucial factor determining the level of resistance is the concept of gene dosage—the number of copies of a resistance gene within a cell. This practice [@problem_id:2279422] provides a clear, quantitative scenario to explore how housing a resistance gene on a high-copy-number plasmid, versus a low-copy-number one, dramatically influences the amount of resistance enzyme produced and, consequently, the bacterium's survival ceiling against an antibiotic.", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, a researcher is studying antibiotic resistance in *Escherichia coli*. Two strains of *E. coli*, Strain X and Strain Y, are used. Both strains are initially sensitive to the antibiotic ampicillin. Ampicillin resistance is often conferred by the *bla* gene, which codes for the enzyme beta-lactamase. This enzyme inactivates ampicillin by hydrolyzing its beta-lactam ring.\n\nThe researcher transforms both strains with plasmids carrying the exact same *bla* gene, including its promoter and other regulatory sequences. The only difference is the type of plasmid used:\n- Strain X is transformed with a high-copy-number plasmid, which replicates to maintain approximately 500 copies per cell.\n- Strain Y is transformed with a low-copy-number plasmid, which replicates to maintain approximately 10 copies per cell.\n\nAssuming all other conditions are identical (e.g., cell growth rate, nutrient availability, transformation efficiency) and that the production of beta-lactamase is not limited by other cellular resources, which of the following outcomes is most likely when both strains are grown on culture plates with a gradient of increasing ampicillin concentration?\n\nA. Strain X will be able to grow at higher ampicillin concentrations than Strain Y.\n\nB. Strain Y will be able to grow at higher ampicillin concentrations than Strain X.\n\nC. Both strains will show identical levels of resistance and grow up to the same ampicillin concentration.\n\nD. Neither strain will be effectively resistant because the metabolic load of the plasmids will weaken the cells.\n\nE. The level of resistance will be primarily determined by random mutations in the host chromosome, not the plasmids.", "solution": "Define $c_{X}$ and $c_{Y}$ as the plasmid copy numbers in Strain X and Strain Y, respectively, with $c_{X}>c_{Y}$ by the problem setup. Because the two plasmids carry the exact same $bla$ gene, promoter, and regulatory sequences, and the problem assumes that production of beta-lactamase is not limited by other cellular resources, the per-cell beta-lactamase level scales linearly with copy number. Let $\\alpha$ collect the effective transcription, translation, and protein stability factors (identical between strains). Then the steady-state enzyme levels satisfy\n$$\nE_{X}=\\alpha c_{X},\\quad E_{Y}=\\alpha c_{Y}.\n$$\nAmpicillin inactivation by beta-lactamase increases with enzyme amount. Let the effective detoxification capacity be $V_{\\text{detox}}=k E$, where $k$ is a proportionality constant capturing catalytic efficiency and antibiotic availability to the enzyme. Let the antibiotic influx scale with the external concentration as $J_{\\text{in}}=k_{\\text{in}}A_{\\text{ext}}$, where $k_{\\text{in}}$ is an effective influx constant and $A_{\\text{ext}}$ is the external ampicillin concentration. A sufficient condition for maintaining a non-inhibitory intracellular antibiotic level during growth is that detoxification capacity at least balances influx:\n$$\nV_{\\text{detox}}\\geq J_{\\text{in}}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad kE\\geq k_{\\text{in}}A_{\\text{ext}}.\n$$\nThis yields a maximum external concentration compatible with growth,\n$$\nA_{\\text{ext,max}}=\\frac{k}{k_{\\text{in}}}E=\\frac{k}{k_{\\text{in}}}\\alpha c\\equiv \\beta c,\n$$\nwhere $\\beta=(k\\alpha)/k_{\\text{in}}$ is constant across strains under the stated assumptions. Therefore,\n$$\n\\frac{A_{\\text{ext,max},X}}{A_{\\text{ext,max},Y}}=\\frac{c_{X}}{c_{Y}}>1,\n$$\nso Strain X, with the higher copy number, achieves a higher beta-lactamase level and thus tolerates higher ampicillin concentrations than Strain Y. Options asserting identical resistance are inconsistent with $c_{X}\\neq c_{Y}$, metabolic-load failure is excluded by the assumption that production is not resource-limited, and random chromosomal mutations are not the primary determinant here since both strains receive the same resistance gene and conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2279422"}, {"introduction": "One of the most direct forms of resistance involves bacteria producing enzymes that chemically inactivate an antibiotic before it can reach its target. The effectiveness of this strategy depends on the enzyme's efficiency, a property we can describe using the principles of enzyme kinetics. This practice [@problem_id:2279451] challenges you to apply the Michaelis-Menten model to a real-world scenario, calculating precisely how long it takes for a bacterial population to neutralize an antibiotic threat and connecting molecular kinetic parameters like $K_M$ and $k_{cat}$ to the survival of the pathogen.", "problem": "A pathogenic bacterial strain, *Resistobacterium pharmacovorax*, has developed resistance to a novel antibiotic. The mechanism of resistance involves a periplasmic enzyme, which we will call Antibiotic Glycosylating Enzyme (AGE).

A researcher prepares a liquid culture medium containing a high density of stationary-phase *R. pharmacovorax*, resulting in a constant and uniform concentration of the AGE enzyme in the medium.\n\nThe kinetics of the AGE enzyme with respect to the antibiotic as a substrate are characterized by a Michaelis constant, $K_M = 40.0 \\text{ µM}$, and a turnover number, $k_{cat} = 150 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.

By deriving the condition where the frequency of resistance remains stable, you will gain a deeper understanding of the delicate balance governing the fate of resistance in clinically relevant scenarios.", "problem": "A bio-reactor contains a large, well-mixed population of bacteria. This population consists of two strains: a wild-type strain that is sensitive to a particular antibiotic, and a mutant strain that is resistant.
