This exercise explores the profound biophysical consequences of this structure, specifically how it allows a plant cell to thrive in a hypotonic environment that would destroy an animal cell. By applying the concept of water potential, symbolized as $\\Psi$, you will unpack the interplay between solute potential ($\\Psi_s$) and the crucial turgor pressure ($\\Psi_p$) that gives plants their structural integrity. Mastering this principle is fundamental to understanding everything from how a seedling stands up to how water moves through the tallest trees.[@problem_id:2285472]", "problem": "A botanist is studying osmotic regulation in plant cells. A single, healthy plant cell is carefully isolated from a leaf and placed into a beaker filled with pure, distilled water at standard temperature and pressure. The system is then left undisturbed to reach equilibrium. The movement of water across the cell membrane is governed by water potential ($\\Psi$), which is the sum of solute potential ($\\Psi_s$) and pressure potential ($\\Psi_p$), such that $\\Psi = \\Psi_s + \\Psi_p$. Water flows from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential. By convention, the water potential of pure water in an open container is 0 MPa. The solute potential of a solution is always negative, while the pressure potential can be positive, negative, or zero.\n\nUnlike an animal cell, which would rapidly swell and lyse (burst) under these conditions, the plant cell swells but remains intact. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete biophysical explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The plant cell membrane is inherently stronger than an animal cell membrane and can withstand higher internal pressures without rupturing.\n\nB. As water enters the cell, the plasma membrane pushes against the rigid cell wall, which exerts an opposing physical pressure (turgor pressure). This positive pressure potential increases the cell's total water potential until it equals the zero water potential of the surrounding pure water, halting net water influx.\n\nC. The cell wall is completely impermeable to water, effectively isolating the cell's internal environment from the surrounding distilled water and preventing any significant swelling.\n\nD. The plant cell actively transports solutes out into the surrounding water, causing the solute potential inside the cell to rise until it matches the solute potential of the pure water, thereby stopping osmosis.\n\nE. Water enters the cell until the protoplast has expanded enough to make the cell wall fully permeable to the internal solutes, allowing them to diffuse out and equalize the water potential.", "solution": "Water potential is defined as $\\Psi=\\Psi_{s}+\\Psi_{p}$, where $\\Psi_{s}$ (solute potential) is negative for solutions and $\\Psi_{p}$ (pressure potential) can be positive, zero, or negative. Pure water in an open beaker has $\\Psi_{\\text{out}}=0$ by convention.\n\nFor a healthy plant cell initially placed in pure water, the cytoplasm has $\\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}<0$ and, if initially flaccid, $\\Psi_{p,\\text{in}}\\approx 0$. Thus the initial internal water potential satisfies\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{in, initial}}=\\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}+\\Psi_{p,\\text{in}}<0.\n$$\nWater moves from higher to lower water potential, so since $\\Psi_{\\text{out}}=0$ and $\\Psi_{\\text{in, initial}}<0$, water flows into the cell.\n\nAs water enters, the protoplast expands and pushes the plasma membrane against the rigid cell wall. The elastic resistance of the cell wall generates an opposing compressive force that manifests as an increase in the internal hydrostatic (turgor) pressure, i.e., $\\Psi_{p,\\text{in}}$ increases to positive values. The solute potential $\\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}$ remains negative, so the total internal water potential increases toward zero:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{in}}=\\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}+\\Psi_{p,\\text{in}} \\to 0.\n$$\nAt equilibrium, net water movement ceases when\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{in, eq}}=\\Psi_{\\text{out}}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}+\\Psi_{p,\\text{in}}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Psi_{p,\\text{in}}=-\\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}>0.\n$$\nThus the plant cell swells until the positive turgor pressure exactly balances the negative solute potential, bringing the internal water potential to the external value, halting net influx without lysis. This stability arises from the rigid cell wall’s ability to generate and sustain positive pressure potential; animal cells lack a rigid wall and cannot develop sufficient opposing pressure, so they lyse under similar conditions.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the plasma membrane’s inherent strength is not the determining factor; the cell wall’s mechanical resistance and the resulting $\\Psi_{p}$ are.\n- B correctly states that as water enters, the membrane presses against the rigid wall, generating positive turgor pressure that raises $\\Psi_{\\text{in}}$ to match the external $\\Psi$, stopping net influx.\n- C is false because the cell wall is porous and water-permeable; it does not isolate the cell from water.\n- D is incorrect because stopping osmosis does not require active solute export to make $\\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}=0$; instead, pressure potential balances solute potential.\n- E is incorrect because changes in solute permeability of the wall are not the mechanism; the plasma membrane remains selectively permeable, and equilibrium is achieved via pressure, not solute leakage.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete biophysical explanation is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2285472"}, {"introduction": "From a single fertilized cell, a plant develops an array of complex structures with remarkable precision.
