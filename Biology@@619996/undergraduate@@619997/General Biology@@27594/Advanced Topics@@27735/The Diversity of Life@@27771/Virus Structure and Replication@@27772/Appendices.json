This exercise challenges you to apply this concept by analyzing a hypothetical hybrid virus, separating the role of the capsid in determining host range from the role of the genome in dictating protein synthesis [@problem_id:2325549]. This practice sharpens your ability to predict viral behavior by understanding the specific jobs of its core components.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a virologist constructs a hybrid virus particle. This new virion is assembled using two well-characterized parent viruses: Virus A and Virus B.\n\n- **Virus A** is an animal virus whose native host range is restricted to human pancreatic beta cells. It achieves this specificity via proteins in its outer capsid that bind to unique receptors on the surface of these human cells.\n- **Virus B** is a plant virus that exclusively infects cells in the leaves of the tomato plant (*Solanum lycopersicum*). Its genetic material is a single strand of RNA that codes for its own set of viral proteins.\n\nThe hybrid virus is constructed with the complete protein capsid of Virus A and the complete RNA genome of Virus B.\n\nAssuming this hybrid virus is introduced to a mixed culture containing both human pancreatic beta cells and tomato leaf cells, which of the following outcomes is expected?\n\nA. The hybrid virus will infect tomato leaf cells and cause the synthesis of Virus A proteins.\n\nB.

The hybrid virus will infect both cell types, synthesizing Virus B proteins in both.", "solution": "We identify and apply two fundamental virology principles:\n\n1) Host range and cell entry are determined by the virion’s exterior (capsid or envelope) proteins via specific binding to cell-surface receptors and the ability to traverse cell barriers. Denote the capsid proteins by $P_{\\text{capsid}}$ and the host receptor(s) by $R$. Infection requires specific binding, modeled conceptually as $P_{\\text{capsid}}^{A}$ matching $R_{\\text{human}\\ \\beta\\text{-cell}}$, while failing to match $R_{\\text{tomato leaf}}$, and also requires overcoming structural barriers such as the plant cell wall. By the problem statement, Virus A’s capsid proteins specifically bind human pancreatic beta cell receptors and not plant cells. Therefore, a hybrid with the complete capsid of Virus A will attach to and enter human pancreatic beta cells but will not attach to or enter tomato leaf cells.\n\n2) The proteins synthesized after entry are determined by the viral genome present in the particle. Let the genome be $G$ and the set of proteins encoded be $S(G)$. Because the hybrid carries the complete RNA genome of Virus B, the set of viral proteins produced after successful entry is $S(G_{B})$, i.e., the proteins of Virus B. The identity of the capsid does not alter which proteins are encoded and expressed; it only dictates which cells can be infected.\n\nApplying these principles:\n\n- Entry step: The hybrid’s $P_{\\text{capsid}}^{A}$ binds $R_{\\text{human}\\ \\beta\\text{-cell}}$, enabling infection of human pancreatic beta cells. It cannot infect tomato leaf cells because it lacks the necessary plant-specific entry mechanisms and cannot overcome the plant cell wall, and it lacks matching receptors on plant cells.\n\n- Expression step: Once inside a human pancreatic beta cell, the genome $G_{B}$ directs synthesis of Virus B proteins, i.e., the cell will produce the proteins encoded by Virus B’s RNA.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A: Incorrect. Entry into tomato leaf cells fails due to the capsid of Virus A; synthesis of Virus A proteins would also be incorrect because the genome is from Virus B.\n- B: Incorrect. Entry into human beta cells is correct, but synthesis of Virus A proteins is incorrect because the genome is Virus B.\n- C: Incorrect. Entry into tomato leaf cells fails.\n- D: Correct. The hybrid infects human pancreatic beta cells (capsid of A) and synthesizes Virus B proteins (genome of B).\n- E: Incorrect. It can infect human pancreatic beta cells.\n- F: Incorrect. It cannot infect tomato leaf cells, and in any infected cell the proteins synthesized are from Virus B only.\n\nThus, the expected outcome is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2325549"}, {"introduction": "During assembly, a new virion must specifically package the viral genome, ignoring the vast excess of host cell RNA and DNA. This problem guides you through the interpretation of a series of elegant experiments designed to test the function of a hypothesized \"packaging signal\" [@problem_id:2325552]. By thinking like an experimentalist, you will practice using evidence from deletion and trans-packaging assays to deduce the function of a crucial cis-acting element in the viral life cycle.", "problem": "Researchers are investigating the replication of \"Somnusvirus,\" a newly discovered, non-pathogenic, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that infects a specific line of cultured insect cells. The viral genome is a linear RNA molecule that encodes two main proteins: an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) required for genome replication, and a capsid protein (CP) that self-assembles to form the viral particle. Between the coding sequences for RdRp and CP, there is a conserved 150-nucleotide non-coding region, which the researchers hypothesize is a \"Packaging Signal\" (PS). They believe this PS sequence is recognized by the capsid proteins, ensuring that only the viral genome is packaged into new virions.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, they conducted a series of experiments using genetic constructs transfected into the host insect cells. Transfection efficiency is assumed to be 100%.\n\n*   **Experiment 1 (Wild-Type Control):** Cells were transfected with the full-length, wild-type (WT) Somnusvirus RNA. The supernatant (extracellular fluid) was collected 48 hours later and analyzed. Result: A high concentration of infectious viral particles was detected.\n\n*   **Experiment 2 (Deletion Mutant):** Cells were transfected with a mutant Somnusvirus RNA construct (`RNA_ΔPS`) from which the 150-nucleotide PS region was precisely deleted. All other parts of the genome, including the RdRp and CP coding regions, were left intact. Result: Intracellular analysis confirmed the production of both RdRp and CP proteins and replication of the `RNA_ΔPS` genome, but no infectious viral particles were detected in the supernatant.\n\n*   **Experiment 3 (Trans-Packaging Assay):** Cells were co-transfected with two different RNA molecules simultaneously:\n    1.  **Helper RNA:** The `RNA_ΔPS` construct from Experiment 2, which can produce all viral proteins but lacks the packaging signal.\n    2.  **Reporter RNA:** A short, synthetic RNA molecule consisting only of the 150-nucleotide PS sequence attached to the coding sequence for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). This RNA cannot produce any viral proteins (RdRp or CP).\n    Result: The supernatant was found to contain non-infectious, virus-like particles. When these particles were purified and used to treat a fresh culture of naive insect cells, the cells exhibited strong green fluorescence. However, these fluorescent cells did not produce any new viral particles.\n\nBased on the results of all three experiments, which of the following is the most accurate conclusion?\n\nA. The PS sequence is an essential promoter element required for the translation of the capsid protein (CP).\n\nB. The PS sequence is necessary for the viral RNA to be replicated by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).\n\nC. The PS sequence encodes a small, undiscovered third viral protein that is essential for virion assembly.\n\nD. The PS sequence acts as a cis-acting signal that is both necessary for a Somnusvirus RNA to be packaged and sufficient to direct the packaging of a foreign RNA into a Somnusvirus capsid.\n\nE. The capsid protein (CP) is inherently unstable and requires direct binding to the PS sequence to fold correctly.", "solution": "We interpret the experiments as tests of three separable functions of the conserved 150-nucleotide region between the RdRp and CP coding sequences: translation of CP, replication by RdRp, and packaging/assembly mediated by CP.\n\nFirst, the wild-type control shows that the intact genome yields a high concentration of infectious particles, establishing that the experimental system and timing are appropriate and that the PS-containing genome is fully competent for replication, expression, and packaging.\n\nSecond, the PS-deletion construct produces both RdRp and CP and supports replication of the deleted genome, yet yields no infectious particles in the supernatant. From the confirmed expression of CP and replication of the genome lacking PS, we deduce:\n- The PS is not required for translation of CP. If it were a promoter element necessary for CP translation, CP would not be detected. This contradicts option A.\n- The PS is not required for replication by RdRp. If it were necessary for replication, replication would not be detected. This contradicts option B.\n- The PS does not encode a protein essential for assembly. The region is defined as non-coding, deletion does not ablate CP or RdRp expression, and the defect specifically appears at the step of particle formation/release or packaging. This contradicts option C.\nThus, the absence of infectious particles specifically implicates a function in genome packaging/assembly.\n\nThird, in the co-transfection (trans-packaging) assay, the helper RNA lacking PS provides CP (and RdRp), while the reporter RNA contains only the PS fused to GFP and cannot produce any viral proteins. The supernatant contains non-infectious virus-like particles that, upon delivery to naive cells, cause GFP fluorescence but do not yield new virions. This outcome requires that:\n- The reporter RNA bearing the PS was selectively packaged into capsids assembled from CP produced by the helper. The delivery of GFP to naive cells demonstrates encapsidation and entry of the reporter RNA.\n- The resulting particles are non-infectious because the packaged RNA lacks the viral coding capacity (no RdRp, no CP), so no replication or progeny production ensues. This shows that packaging is driven by the PS in cis on the RNA to be encapsidated, not by the coding capacity of that RNA.\n- The helper RNA lacking PS is not detectably packaged; otherwise, infectious progeny would have appeared. Therefore, PS is necessary for an RNA to be packaged.\n\nTogether, Experiment 2 demonstrates necessity of PS for packaging of the viral genome, while Experiment 3 demonstrates sufficiency of the PS to direct packaging of a foreign RNA (GFP) into capsids in trans when CP is supplied from a separate RNA. These findings directly support that the PS is a cis-acting packaging signal that is both necessary for Somnusvirus RNA packaging and sufficient to target an unrelated RNA to Somnusvirus capsids. This conclusion rules out the alternative hypotheses regarding translation control, replication, hidden coding capacity, or CP folding/stability (option E), since CP is produced and can assemble into particles when a PS-bearing RNA substrate is present.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the PS acts as a cis-acting signal necessary and sufficient for packaging as described in option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2325552"}, {"introduction": "Many complex viruses don't express all their genes at once; instead, they follow a strict temporal program to maximize efficiency and ensure each replication step occurs in the proper sequence. This problem presents a logical puzzle regarding gene regulation, asking you to determine the architecture of a genetic circuit that controls this timing [@problem_id:2325554]. By strategically placing activators and repressors, you will construct a functional network that demonstrates how viruses achieve sophisticated control over their life cycle.", "problem": "A virologist is studying the transcriptional regulatory network of a newly discovered large bacteriophage. The phage genome exhibits a clear temporal organization into three gene classes: Early (E), Middle (M), and Late (L). The Late gene class contains the gene responsible for host cell lysis. To ensure successful replication, the phage must enforce a strict sequence of gene expression (E, then M, then L), shut down early gene expression after the middle phase begins, and include a robust safeguard against premature cell lysis.\n\nBased on sequence analysis, the virologist has identified the following fixed promoter logic and a set of three mobile regulatory genes encoding proteins A, B, and R. The task is to determine how these regulatory genes must be distributed between the Early and Middle gene classes to create a functional circuit.\n\n**Fixed Network Properties:**\n1.  **Promoter Logic:**\n    *   **Early (E) Promoters:** Recognized and transcribed by the host's native RNA polymerase immediately upon DNA injection.\n    *   **Middle (M) Promoters:** Are completely silent until activated by the binding of **Protein A**.\n    *   **Late (L) Promoters:** Are completely silent unless **both Protein A and Protein B** are simultaneously bound (functioning as a logical AND gate).\n2.  **Regulatory Proteins:**\n    *   **Protein A:** A transcriptional activator.\n    *   **Protein B:** A transcriptional activator.\n    *   **Protein R:** A transcriptional repressor that specifically binds to and silences all Early (E) promoters.\n\n**The Challenge:**\nYou must select the network architecture that correctly arranges the coding sequences for proteins A, B, and R within the phage's gene classes. Which of the following assignments of genes to classes creates a temporal program that meets all the phage's requirements: (1) strict E → M → L expression order, (2) shutdown of E-gene expression after M-gene activation, and (3) a robust delay mechanism preventing premature activation of L-class genes?\n\nA. The Early (E) gene class encodes Protein A. The Middle (M) gene class encodes Protein B and Protein R.\n\nB. The Early (E) gene class encodes Protein A and Protein B. The Middle (M) gene class encodes Protein R.\n\nC. The Early (E) gene class encodes Protein R. The Middle (M) gene class encodes Protein A and Protein B.\n\nD. The Early (E) gene class encodes Protein A and Protein R. The Middle (M) gene class encodes Protein B.", "solution": "We use the fixed promoter logic and regulatory functions to constrain feasible placements of genes A, B, and R across the Early (E) and Middle (M) classes.\n\nStep 1: Ensure that Middle (M) can be activated.\nBy the fixed property, M promoters are completely silent until activated by Protein A. Therefore, Protein A must be present before any M-gene transcription can occur. Since only E promoters are transcribed immediately upon injection by the host RNA polymerase, Protein A must be encoded in the E class. Any architecture placing A only in M cannot start M at all (because M requires A to be active first). This eliminates option C.\n\nStep 2: Prevent premature activation of Late (L) genes as a robust safeguard against early lysis.\nBy the fixed property, L promoters require the simultaneous presence of both A and B (logical AND). Since A must be present early (from Step 1), to prevent L from being active during the early phase, B must not be present in E. Therefore, B must be in M. Any architecture placing B in E would allow L to activate prematurely when both A and B are present early. This eliminates option B.\n\nStep 3: Enforce shutdown of Early (E) expression after the Middle (M) phase begins.\nBy the fixed property, Protein R represses all E promoters. To ensure that E shuts down after M begins (not before), R must be produced as a consequence of M activation. Therefore, R should be encoded in M, not in E. If R were in E, it could repress E before M is activated, risking failure to accumulate sufficient A to start M and violating the requirement that shutdown occurs after M begins. This eliminates option D.\n\nStep 4: Verify that the remaining architecture satisfies all requirements.\nThe remaining option is A: E encodes A; M encodes B and R.\n- Strict E → M → L order: E turns on immediately and produces A; A activates M; M produces B; once both A and B are present, L can activate. Thus L activation is downstream of M activation.\n- Shutdown of E after M begins: R is encoded in M, so its production starts only after M is activated by A; R then represses all E promoters, shutting down E after M has begun.\n- Robust safeguard against premature lysis: L requires both A and B. Early phase has only A present; B is in M and only appears after M activation, so L cannot activate prematurely.\n\nTherefore, option A uniquely satisfies all three constraints mechanistically.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2325554"}]}
