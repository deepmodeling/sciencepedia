This practice [@problem_id:2301344] challenges you to think like an experimentalist by designing a robust protocol to separate bacteria that have become stable lysogens from those that are uninfected or destined for lysis. Successfully devising this strategy requires a practical understanding of gene expression, antibiotic selection, and the distinct timelines of the lytic and lysogenic pathways.", "problem": "An experimental biologist is working with a strain of *E. coli* that is sensitive to the antibiotic ampicillin. They have a sample of a temperate bacteriophage, which has been genetically engineered to carry a gene conferring ampicillin resistance ($amp^R$). The biologist's goal is to create and isolate a pure culture of *E. coli* lysogens, where the prophage carrying the $amp^R$ gene is stably integrated into the bacterial chromosome.\n\nThey perform an initial infection by mixing a high concentration of the engineered phage with a liquid culture of the ampicillin-sensitive *E. coli*. After a short incubation period to allow for phage adsorption and DNA injection, they need to select for the bacteria that have become lysogens.\n\nWhich of the following experimental protocols is the most effective method for isolating the desired *E. coli* lysogens from the infection mixture?\n\nA. Immediately plate the infection mixture onto a nutrient agar plate containing ampicillin. The colonies that grow are the lysogens.\n\nB. Plate the infection mixture onto a standard nutrient agar plate without any antibiotic. After colonies grow, use replica plating to transfer them to a second plate containing ampicillin. The colonies that grow on the ampicillin plate are the lysogens.\n\nC. Add DNase enzyme to the infection mixture to degrade any external phage DNA, then immediately plate the mixture onto a nutrient agar plate containing ampicillin.\n\nD. Incubate the infection mixture in liquid nutrient broth for a period longer than the phage's lytic cycle latent period (e.g., several hours), and then plate a sample of the culture onto nutrient agar containing ampicillin. The colonies that grow are the lysogens.\n\nE. Treat the infection mixture with a strong detergent to lyse all the bacteria. Then, filter and collect the released prophages and use them to infect a new, fresh culture of bacteria.", "solution": "The goal is to isolate bacteria that have stably integrated the phage DNA (lysogens) and thus acquired ampicillin resistance. We must devise a strategy that selects for these cells while eliminating all other cells: uninfected bacteria and bacteria undergoing the lytic cycle.\n\nLet's analyze the possible fates of the bacteria in the initial mixture:\n1.  **Uninfected Bacteria**: These cells did not get infected by a phage. They remain sensitive to ampicillin.\n2.  **Lytically Infected Bacteria**: The phage has injected its DNA, and the cell is now programmed to produce new phages. This process will end with the cell lysing (bursting) and dying. The time from infection to lysis is the latent period.\n3.  **Lysogenically Infected Bacteria (Lysogens)**: The phage has injected its DNA, and the DNA has integrated into the bacterial chromosome to become a prophage. The bacterium survives, is now called a lysogen, and carries the ampicillin resistance gene ($amp^R$). This cell and its descendants will be resistant to ampicillin.\n\nNow, we evaluate each protocol:\n\n**A. Immediately plate on ampicillin:** This method is flawed. While it will kill uninfected, ampicillin-sensitive bacteria, it fails to account for two issues. First, the plate will contain a very high concentration of free phage particles, which can infect and lyse bacteria as they try to form colonies, leading to the formation of plaques (clear zones) and making it difficult to isolate pure colonies. Second, cells that are already committed to the lytic cycle have not yet lysed. They may have had time to express the $amp^R$ gene and might survive on the plate for a short time, but they will not form stable colonies, confusing the results.\n\n**B. Replica plating:** This protocol is inefficient. The initial plate contains no antibiotic, so both uninfected cells and lysogens will grow. Since the frequency of lysogeny is typically low, the vast majority of colonies will be uninfected, ampicillin-sensitive cells. Using replica plating to find the few resistant colonies among thousands of sensitive ones is extremely laborious and not an effective selection method.\n\n**C. Add DNase then plate:** This protocol is based on a misunderstanding of phage structure. A bacteriophage protects its genetic material (DNA or RNA) inside a protein capsid. Extracellular DNase can only degrade \"naked\" DNA in the medium; it cannot penetrate the protein capsid to destroy the DNA within the infectious phage particles. Therefore, this step has no effect on the outcome and suffers from the same problems as protocol A.\n\n**D. Incubate, then plate on ampicillin:** This is the most effective strategy. The initial incubation in nutrient broth (without ampicillin) for several hours serves a crucial purpose. This time is longer than the phage's latent period, allowing any bacteria that entered the lytic cycle to complete the process and lyse. This effectively removes them from the population of viable cells. During this time, the stable lysogens, which are now ampicillin-resistant, will survive and multiply. After this \"enrichment\" period, the culture is plated on ampicillin agar. Any remaining uninfected cells are killed by the ampicillin. Only the lysogens, which are resistant and have increased in number, will be able to grow and form distinct colonies. This combination of enrichment (by waiting for lysis) and selection (with ampicillin) is a powerful and standard method for isolating lysogens.\n\n**E. Lyse and collect prophages:** This protocol is fundamentally incorrect. A \"prophage\" is the state of the phage's genetic material when it is integrated into the host's chromosome. It is not an independent, infectious particle. Lysing the cells would release newly assembled phage virions from cells that underwent the lytic cycle, not \"prophages\". This procedure would fail to isolate lysogens and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the lysogenic cycle.\n\nTherefore, protocol D is the correct and most robust method.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2301344"}, {"introduction": "Having explored how to select for lysogens, we now turn to the molecular decisions that precede integration. This exercise [@problem_id:2301330] presents a clever genetic engineering scenario, where the gene for integrase is replaced by a fluorescent reporter. Predicting the outcome forces you to distinguish between the *activation* of the lysogenic genetic program and the *execution* of the integration step, offering a deeper insight into the phage's regulatory logic.", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists is studying the life cycle of a temperate bacteriophage. This phage can enter either the lytic cycle, resulting in host cell lysis and release of new virions, or the lysogenic cycle, where its genome integrates into the host bacterial chromosome and replicates passively with it. The integration process is mediated by a site-specific recombinase enzyme encoded by the phage's integrase gene, `int`.\n\nTo visualize the molecular decision to enter lysogeny, the team engineers a mutant version of this phage. In this mutant, the coding sequence of the `int` gene is precisely replaced with the gene for a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a protein that glows green under blue or ultraviolet light. The expression of this `gfp` gene is now controlled by the original promoter and regulatory elements of the `int` gene. All other phage genes, including those for lytic replication and the regulatory switch between cycles, remain unchanged.\n\nA dilute suspension of this engineered phage is mixed with a population of susceptible, non-fluorescent host bacteria and spread onto a nutrient agar plate. The plate is incubated under conditions that permit both lytic and lysogenic cycles for the wild-type phage. After incubation, the plate is examined first under normal ambient light to observe plaque morphology and then under a blue light source to observe fluorescence.\n\nWhich of the following options best describes the expected appearance of the plaques on the agar plate?\n\nA. Turbid plaques with uniform fluorescence throughout the plaque area.\n\nB. Clear plaques with a fluorescent green ring at the periphery.\n\nC. Clear plaques with no fluorescence.\n\nD. Turbid plaques with no fluorescence.\n\nE. No plaques form, but the entire bacterial lawn becomes faintly fluorescent.\n\nF. Uniformly fluorescent \"spots\" instead of plaques, where bacteria are still alive but glowing.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the biological roles and observable outcomes:\n- A temperate phage can enter the lytic cycle (host lysis, clear plaques) or the lysogenic cycle (integration via integrase, growth of lysogens within plaques leading to turbidity).\n- The phage integrase, encoded by int, is essential for site-specific integration into the host chromosome; without a functional integrase, stable lysogeny cannot be established.\n- Plaque morphology reflects infection outcomes: clear plaques arise when infections predominantly lyse cells, while turbid plaques reflect survival and growth of lysogens within the plaque.\n\nIn the engineered phage, the int coding sequence is replaced with gfp, under control of the native int promoter and regulatory elements. Two key consequences follow:\n1) Loss of function: The phage cannot integrate because the integrase protein is absent. Therefore, stable lysogeny cannot occur.\n2) Reporter function: Whenever the regulatory network would normally activate the int promoter (i.e., in cells biased toward lysogeny via CII- and CI-mediated regulation), gfp will be transcribed and GFP produced, providing fluorescence as a reporter of the lysogeny program’s transcriptional activation.\n\nFrom these points we deduce the plaque morphology:\n- Because stable lysogeny is not possible without integrase, infected cells cannot become lysogens that survive and populate the plaque. Thus, the plaques will not be turbid; instead, lytic replication will dominate, yielding clear plaques.\n\nFrom these points we deduce the fluorescence pattern:\n- The int promoter (now driving gfp) is transiently activated in newly infected cells that are in the lysogeny-favoring regulatory state. These cells will produce GFP before any subsequent failure to integrate and eventual loss or lysis.\n- In an expanding plaque, the center contains cells infected earlier that have already lysed; there is no fluorescence remaining there. At the advancing edge, newly infected, still-intact cells transiently express gfp from the int promoter before lysis occurs. This creates a narrow fluorescent ring at the plaque periphery.\n\nTherefore, the expected appearance is clear plaques with a fluorescent green ring at the periphery, which corresponds to option B. The other options are inconsistent: turbid plaques require lysogeny (A, D), no fluorescence ignores int promoter activation (C), no plaques or uniformly fluorescent living spots would require the absence of lysis and/or stable lysogeny (E, F), both of which are incompatible with the loss of integrase and intact lytic functions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2301330"}, {"introduction": "While the previous exercises focused on establishing lysogeny, this final practice quantifies the dramatic alternative: the lytic burst.

The prophage's repressor protein, which maintains this dormancy (the lysogenic state), is temperature-sensitive.

You can assume no further bacterial cell division occurs for the duration of the experiment.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the entire culture is shifted to 42°C. This temperature shift causes all prophages within the bacterial population to be induced simultaneously, forcing them to enter the lytic cycle.
