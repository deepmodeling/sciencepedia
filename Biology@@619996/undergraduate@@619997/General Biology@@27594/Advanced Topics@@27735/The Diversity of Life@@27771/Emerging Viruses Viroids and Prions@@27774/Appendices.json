A protease inhibitor drug, \"Proteasevin,\" was developed to target this enzyme. However, after a period of use, a drug-resistant mutant of the virus, SRV-R, emerged. Clinical observations suggest that in the absence of the drug, SRV-R replicates more slowly than the wild-type virus (SRV-WT), indicating a potential fitness cost associated with the resistance mutation.\n\nTo investigate this hypothesis at a molecular level, a team of biochemists isolated the protease enzyme from both SRV-WT and SRV-R. They then performed a series of kinetic assays by measuring the initial velocity ($V_0$) of the proteolytic reaction at various substrate concentrations ($[S]$). The total concentration of the enzyme was kept constant in all experiments.

Since the total enzyme concentration was held constant, this efficiency is directly proportional to the ratio $V_{max}/K_M$. To quantify the fitness cost, calculate the relative catalytic efficiency of the mutant protease compared to the wild-type protease.

This virus replicates exclusively within terminally differentiated, post-mitotic neurons, which are cells with naturally low levels of de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), the building blocks of DNA. To overcome this limitation, the virus expresses a unique protein, V-Kinase Modulator (VKM), which alters the host cell's nucleotide metabolism.\n\nTo quantify this effect, a simplified metabolic flux model is proposed for the synthesis of one specific precursor, deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP). In these neurons, dTTP is produced by two main pathways:\n\n1.  **De Novo Pathway**: The rate-limiting step is the conversion of uridine diphosphate (UDP) to deoxyuridine diphosphate (dUDP), catalyzed by the host enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR).\n2.  **Salvage Pathway**: The key rate-limiting enzyme is thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), which phosphorylates thymidine to produce deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).\n\nFor this model, you can assume that the metabolic flux (rate of production) of dTTP precursors from each pathway is directly proportional to the total activity of its respective rate-limiting enzyme. The activity is measured in arbitrary units (U), where 1 U corresponds to a specific rate of product formation under saturated substrate conditions.\n\nIn an uninfected, quiescent neuron, the basal activities of the key enzymes are:\n-   Basal activity of RNR: $A_{RNR, basal} = 12.0$ U.\n-   Basal activity of TK1: $A_{TK1, basal} = 150.0$ U.\n\nUpon a stable infection and the expression of the viral VKM protein, the host enzyme activities are modulated as follows:\n-   The activity of RNR is inhibited, reducing its effective activity to just 2.0% of its basal level.\n-   The activity of TK1 is significantly upregulated, increasing to 6.2 times its basal activity.\n\nConsidering this model, calculate the proportion of the total dTTP synthesized in a *Synaptophagos silentis*-infected neuron that is generated via the salvage pathway.
