A large, sealed glass terrarium is prepared. Inside, a layer of sterile soil is added, along with a decaying log that is heavily colonized by a pure culture of a saprophytic fungus. The terrarium is sealed with an atmosphere initially identical to Earth's air (approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 0.04% carbon dioxide). The entire setup is placed in a room with no light sources. A sensor inside the terrarium monitors the concentration of various gases.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected change in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) inside the terrarium over a period of several weeks?\n\nA. The $\\text{CO}_2$ concentration will decrease as the fungus absorbs it for chemosynthesis.\nB.

The $\\text{CO}_2$ concentration will first decrease as the fungus establishes itself, then increase sharply.", "solution": "The system is a sealed terrarium containing sterile soil and a decaying log colonized by a pure culture of a saprophytic fungus, with an initial atmosphere like Earth’s air and no light. The only significant biological process available to the fungus for energy is heterotrophic respiration of organic matter; there is no photosynthesis due to absence of light and fungi are not autotrophs. In particular, fungi are not chemoautotrophs and do not perform chemosynthesis to fix $\\text{CO}_2$.\n\nThe fundamental biochemical pathway for heterotrophic decomposition is aerobic respiration, which converts organic carbon to $\\text{CO}_2$ while consuming $\\text{O}_2$. A representative stoichiometric equation for a carbohydrate substrate (e.g., glucose) is:\n$$\n\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6 + 6\\,\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 6\\,\\text{CO}_2 + 6\\,\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\nMore generally, for an organic substrate $\\text{C}_a\\text{H}_b\\text{O}_c\\text{N}_d$, aerobic catabolism produces $a$ moles of $\\text{CO}_2$ per mole of substrate carbon fully oxidized (with water and nitrogenous products formed accordingly), so the net effect is conversion of solid-phase organic carbon in the log to gaseous $\\text{CO}_2$.\n\nBecause the terrarium is sealed, the total amount of carbon is conserved, but its distribution among pools can change. Denote by $n_{\\text{CO}_2}(t)$ the moles of $\\text{CO}_2$ in the gas phase, and by $n_{C,\\text{org}}(t)$ the moles of carbon in the solid organic pool (the log and any fungal biomass). Carbon conservation implies\n$$\nn_{C,\\text{tot}}=n_{\\text{CO}_2}(t)+n_{C,\\text{org}}(t)+n_{C,\\text{aq}}(t),\n$$\nwhere $n_{C,\\text{aq}}(t)$ accounts for dissolved inorganic carbon in soil water. Heterotrophic respiration increases inorganic carbon at the expense of organic carbon, so\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left[n_{\\text{CO}_2}(t)+n_{C,\\text{aq}}(t)\\right]= -\\frac{d}{dt}n_{C,\\text{org}}(t)>0\n$$\nas long as decomposition proceeds. While partitioning between gas and aqueous phases is governed by equilibrium (e.g., Henry’s law), the production term from respiration drives the gas-phase partial pressure of $\\text{CO}_2$ upward over time until limited by $\\text{O}_2$ depletion or substrate exhaustion. There is no biological sink in this system that would reduce $\\text{CO}_2$: there is no photosynthesis in the dark, and the fungus does not fix $\\text{CO}_2$ via chemosynthesis.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because fungi are not chemoautotrophs and do not consume $\\text{CO}_2$ to synthesize biomass using chemical energy sources.\n- Option B is incorrect because, although the system is sealed, internal transformations convert organic carbon into $\\text{CO}_2$, changing gas concentrations.\n- Option D is incorrect because the dominant process (respiration) creates a clear increasing trend rather than random fluctuations.\n- Option E is incorrect because there is no mechanism for an initial decrease in $\\text{CO}_2$; even during any microbial lag phase, respiration still produces some $\\text{CO}_2$, and there is no $\\text{CO}_2$ sink.\n\nThe expected outcome over several weeks is that $\\text{CO}_2$ concentration increases as the fungus decomposes the organic matter in the log, consuming $\\text{O}_2$ and producing $\\text{CO}_2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2285183"}, {"introduction": "The filamentous, network-like growth of many fungi is a brilliant strategy for exploring and exploiting resources, but it comes with a significant risk: a single break in a hypha could lead to a catastrophic loss of cytoplasm. This practice [@problem_id:2285185] delves into the elegant cellular engineering fungi have evolved to solve this problem. By considering a mutant fungus lacking a key safety feature known as the Woronin body, you will explore the critical link between microscopic structure and organismal survival.", "problem": "A mycologist is investigating the cellular mechanisms of damage response in the filamentous ascomycete fungus, *Neurospora crassa*. This organism's hyphae—the long, branching filaments that constitute its mycelium—are divided into compartments by cross-walls called septa. Each septum is perforated by a central pore, allowing for cytoplasmic continuity and intercellular transport between compartments.\n\nThe researcher compares two strains grown on a nutrient agar plate:\n1. A wild-type (WT) strain with normal cellular structures.\n2. A mutant strain, `hex-1`, which is known to be deficient in the assembly of functional Woronin bodies. Woronin bodies are dense, proteinaceous organelles unique to ascomycete fungi that are typically found tethered to the cytoskeleton near septal pores.\n\nThe researcher inflicts a precise, standardized injury to both strains by severing a single leading hypha at a point 500 micrometers from its growing tip. Based on the known function of the structures involved, what is the most likely primary and immediate consequence for the `hex-1` mutant hypha compared to the wild-type hypha following this injury?\n\nA. The `hex-1` mutant hypha will experience catastrophic and continuous cytoplasmic bleeding, leading to the rapid emptying of multiple compartments proximal to the injury site.\nB. The `hex-1` mutant hypha will be unable to transport organelles through its septal pores, effectively starving the hyphal tip, but will not lose a significant amount of cytoplasm.\nC. The `hex-1` mutant will form a new hyphal tip or branch just behind the point of injury much more rapidly than the wild-type, as a form of overcompensation.\nD. The septa in the `hex-1` mutant hypha will completely dissolve near the point of injury, converting the local region into a coenocytic (non-septate) structure to re-distribute pressure.\nE. There will be no significant difference, as the plasma membrane at the open end of the hypha will rapidly reseal in both the `hex-1` mutant and the wild-type, containing the damage to the single severed compartment.", "solution": "Step 1: Recall the relevant cellular structures and their functions.\n- In filamentous ascomycete fungi such as Neurospora crassa, hyphae are compartmentalized by septa that contain central pores, allowing cytoplasmic continuity under normal conditions.\n- Woronin bodies are dense, proteinaceous organelles tethered near septal pores. Their established immediate function in damage response is to occlude septal pores rapidly upon plasma membrane rupture or hyphal lysis, thereby isolating the damaged compartment and preventing cytoplasmic loss from adjacent compartments.\n- The HEX-1 protein is the major matrix component required for functional Woronin bodies. hex-1 mutants lack properly assembled Woronin bodies and therefore cannot rapidly plug septal pores upon injury.\n\nStep 2: Predict the immediate response to hyphal severing in the wild-type.\n- Upon severing a leading hypha, turgor-driven cytoplasmic flow would initially force cytoplasm out of the open end.\n- In the wild-type, Woronin bodies near the septal pore just proximal to the injury will rapidly move to and occlude the pore, isolating the terminal compartment.\n- Consequence: cytoplasmic loss is largely restricted to the terminal (severed) compartment, preserving the cytoplasm and integrity of more proximal compartments.\n\nStep 3: Predict the immediate response to hyphal severing in the hex-1 mutant.\n- Without functional Woronin bodies, the rapid, mechanical occlusion of the septal pore does not occur.\n- The turgor-driven cytoplasmic flow will continue through the open end, and in the absence of septal pore plugging, cytoplasm from compartments proximal to the injury will drain through the septal pores and out of the wound.\n- Consequence: extensive, potentially catastrophic cytoplasmic bleeding beyond the terminal compartment, leading to rapid emptying of multiple upstream compartments.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given options.\n- Option A: Predicts catastrophic and continuous cytoplasmic bleeding with rapid emptying of multiple compartments proximal to the injury in hex-1. This matches the known function of Woronin bodies and the phenotype of hex-1 mutants.\n- Option B: Predicts transport failure without significant cytoplasmic loss. This is inconsistent with the primary known role of Woronin bodies, which is damage sealing, not routine organelle transport. The immediate consequence after injury in hex-1 is uncontrolled cytoplasmic loss, not merely transport starvation.\n- Option C: Predicts accelerated regenerative growth behind the injury. While regeneration can occur, it is not the primary immediate response and hex-1 mutants do not overcompensate in this manner as an immediate effect; moreover, they are compromised in damage containment.\n- Option D: Predicts dissolution of septa to redistribute pressure. This is not a documented immediate response mechanism in Neurospora crassa; septal dissolution is not the acute response to injury.\n- Option E: Predicts no significant difference due to rapid membrane resealing at the open end. This contradicts the established requirement for Woronin body–mediated septal plugging for rapid containment; hex-1 shows a pronounced defect.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion.\n- The most likely immediate consequence for the hex-1 mutant compared to wild-type is uncontrolled cytoplasmic bleeding from multiple compartments due to failure to plug septal pores, corresponding to Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2285185"}, {"introduction": "Fungi are the planet's master decomposers, capable of breaking down even the most resilient biological materials like wood. However, not all fungi approach this task in the same way. This final practice [@problem_id:2285206] presents a biochemical puzzle, challenging you to deduce the distinct ecological strategies of two different wood-decay fungi by examining their unique enzymatic toolkits. This exercise highlights how specific metabolic capabilities define a fungus's ecological niche and its potential use in biotechnology.", "problem": "A biotechnology firm is investigating two fungal isolates, designated F-Alpha and F-Beta, for their potential in large-scale biomass processing. The primary substrate for these fungi is wood, which is composed of three main polymers: cellulose (a linear polymer of glucose units), hemicellulose (branched heterogeneous polysaccharides), and lignin (a complex, irregular aromatic polymer responsible for structural rigidity). The firm conducts a series of analyses on the extracellular fluid of each fungus after cultivation on a wood-based medium.\n\n**Isolate F-Alpha:** This fungus shows robust secretion of cellulases and hemicellulases. Crucially, it also produces high concentrations of Lignin-Modifying Enzymes (LMEs), specifically Lignin Peroxidase (LiP) and Manganese Peroxidase (MnP). These enzymes are known to directly catalyze the oxidative cleavage of the aromatic rings and polymer backbone of lignin.\n\n**Isolate F-Beta:** This fungus also demonstrates high activity of cellulases and hemicellulases. However, it exhibits no detectable LiP or MnP activity. Instead, further analysis reveals that this isolate secretes metabolites that facilitate a non-enzymatic Fenton reaction ($\\text{Fe}^{2+} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}_2 \\to \\text{Fe}^{3+} + \\text{OH}^{\\cdot} + \\text{OH}^-$) in the microenvironment, generating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ($\\text{OH}^{\\cdot}$) that chemically modify the lignin structure without extensive depolymerization.\n\nBased on these distinct biochemical strategies, which of the following statements most accurately classifies the fungal types and identifies a plausible, specialized industrial application for one of them?\n\nA. F-Alpha is a brown rot fungus, best suited for producing bio-ethanol by saccharifying cellulose. F-Beta is a white rot fungus, which is ineffective for this application.\nB. F-Alpha is a white rot fungus, best suited for the bioremediation of industrial effluents contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). F-Beta is a brown rot fungus.\nC. Both F-Alpha and F-Beta are white rot fungi with different mechanisms. F-Alpha is better for biopulping (removing lignin from wood fibers), while F-Beta is better for bioremediation.\nD. F-Alpha is a white rot fungus. F-Beta is a brown rot fungus, best suited for selectively extracting intact lignin for developing high-value carbon fibers.\nE. F-Alpha is a brown rot fungus. F-Beta is a white rot fungus, best suited for the bioremediation of heavy metal contamination.", "solution": "The core classification principle is based on lignin attack. White rot fungi secrete lignin-modifying enzymes such as lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase that catalyze oxidative cleavage of lignin’s aromatic rings and backbone, resulting in extensive lignin depolymerization and bleaching of wood. Brown rot fungi lack or have negligible activity of these LMEs and instead generate hydroxyl radicals via chelator-mediated Fenton chemistry, typically described by the reaction $\\text{Fe}^{2+} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}_2 \\to \\text{Fe}^{3+} + \\text{OH}^{\\cdot} + \\text{OH}^-$. Brown rot thereby causes rapid depolymerization of cellulose and hemicellulose while leaving lignin chemically modified but largely undegraded.\n\nApplying these criteria:\n- Isolate F-Alpha produces robust cellulases and hemicellulases and, crucially, exhibits high lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity. This pattern is diagnostic of a white rot fungus that achieves direct, enzymatic oxidative cleavage of lignin.\n- Isolate F-Beta has strong polysaccharide hydrolases but no detectable LiP or MnP. Instead, it drives a non-enzymatic Fenton reaction to generate $\\text{OH}^{\\cdot}$ radicals, which modify lignin without extensive depolymerization. This is characteristic of a brown rot fungus.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A: Incorrect. It reverses the classifications; F-Alpha is not brown rot, and F-Beta is not white rot.\n- B: Correct. F-Alpha is a white rot fungus, and white rot LMEs (LiP/MnP) are well known to oxidatively degrade recalcitrant aromatics such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, making them suitable for bioremediation of PAH-contaminated effluents. F-Beta aligns with brown rot.\n- C: Incorrect. F-Beta is not white rot; it uses Fenton chemistry without LMEs. Moreover, white rot is typically favored for broad-spectrum bioremediation of aromatics.\n- D: Incorrect. Brown rot does not selectively extract intact lignin suitable for high-value carbon fiber production; it leaves chemically modified, not intact, lignin.\n- E: Incorrect due to reversed classifications; also, heavy metals are not degraded, and white rot’s comparative advantage lies in degrading complex organics rather than remediating metals per se.\n\nTherefore, the statement that correctly classifies the fungi and identifies a plausible, specialized application is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2285206"}]}
