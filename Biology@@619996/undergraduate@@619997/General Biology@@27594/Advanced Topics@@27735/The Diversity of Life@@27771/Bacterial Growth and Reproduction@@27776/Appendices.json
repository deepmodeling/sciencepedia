The student uses a Petroff-Hausser counting chamber, which has a ruled area of 1 square millimeter (mm^2) divided into 25 large squares.

The student counted an average of $C = 15$ cells in the volume of one large square.\nThe concentration, $\\rho$, is the number of cells divided by the volume in which they were counted:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{C}{V_{\\text{square}}} = \\frac{15\\ \\text{cells}}{0.0008\\ \\text{mm}^3} = 18750\\ \\text{cells/mm}^3$$\n\nFinally, we must convert this concentration from cells/mm^3 to the required units of cells/mL.\nWe use the conversion between milliliters (mL) and cubic millimeters (mm^3).\nBy definition, $1\\ \\text{mL} = 1\\ \\text{cm}^3$.\nWe also know that $1\\ \\text{cm} = 10\\ \\text{mm}$.\nTherefore, $1\\ \\text{cm}^3 = (10\\ \\text{mm})^3 = 1000\\ \\text{mm}^3$.\nSo, the conversion factor is $1\\ \\text{mL} = 1000\\ \\text{mm}^3$.\n\nTo convert our concentration to cells/mL, we multiply by this conversion factor:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{mL}} = \\rho \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\text{mm}^3}{1\\ \\text{mL}} = 18750\\ \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\text{mm}^3} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\text{mm}^3}{1\\ \\text{mL}} = 18,750,000\\ \\text{cells/mL}$$\n\nThe last step is to express this number in scientific notation and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$$18,750,000 = 1.875 \\times 10^7$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $1.88 \\times 10^7$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.88 \\times 10^{7}}$$", "id": "2281090"}, {"introduction": "While direct counting is accurate for determining the total number of cells, it can be slow and labor-intensive.
