By tracking radioactively labeled sugars, you can visualize the flow from a source to different sinks.

The plant possesses several key structures: a single, developing flower bud; a large, mature storage root (such as a taproot); and numerous mature photosynthetically active leaves. For the experiment, one of the mature leaves is enclosed in a transparent, airtight bag that is filled with carbon dioxide gas containing a radioactive isotope, carbon-14 ($^{14}\\text{C}$). The plant is illuminated, allowing photosynthesis to proceed for several hours. This process incorporates the radioactive $^{14}\\text{C}$ into sucrose molecules within the treated leaf. After this period, the plant is analyzed to determine the distribution of the radioactive sucrose.\n\nAssuming the plant's transport systems are fully functional, which of the following locations would be expected to show the highest concentration of radioactivity, indicating the greatest accumulation of the newly synthesized sugars?\n\nA. The mature storage root.\n\nB. The vascular tissue (xylem and phloem) of the main stem.\n\nC. The developing flower bud.\n\nD. The mature leaf that was enclosed in the bag.\n\nE. All sinks would show an equal concentration of radioactivity.", "solution": "The mature, photosynthetically active leaf enclosed in $^{14}\\text{CO}_{2}$ is the source tissue. Photosynthesis fixes $^{14}\\text{C}$ into triose phosphates that are converted to sucrose, which is then phloem-loaded. According to the pressure-flow (Münch) mechanism, phloem loading increases sieve element solute concentration $C_{s}$ at the source, raising osmotic pressure\n$$\n\\Pi_{s} = R T C_{s},\n$$\nwhich lowers the source water potential $\\psi_{s}$, drives water influx from xylem, and elevates source turgor pressure $P_{s}$. At sinks, sucrose unloading lowers solute concentration $C_{k}$ and osmotic pressure $\\Pi_{k} = R T C_{k}$, raises $\\psi_{k}$, promotes water efflux, and lowers sink turgor pressure $P_{k}$. The resulting pressure gradient drives bulk flow with flux\n$$\nJ = K \\left(P_{s} - P_{k}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the hydraulic conductance of the phloem pathway. Among multiple sinks $i$, partitioning of assimilate follows relative sink strengths and pathway resistances; stronger unloading and utilization at a sink $i$ lowers $P_{k,i}$ more, yielding larger $P_{s} - P_{k,i}$ and larger $J_{i}$, hence greater accumulation of label.\n\nSink strength is highest in rapidly growing and developing tissues due to high rates of unloading and metabolism. In a flowering plant, a developing flower bud is a dominant sink compared with a mature storage root, which, being already mature, has reduced incremental demand for new assimilate. The vascular tissue of the stem is a conduit, not a primary site of net accumulation; it will transiently contain labeled sucrose but not retain the highest concentration. The labeled mature leaf is a net exporter (source), so it will not accumulate the greatest amount of labeled sucrose. Because sink strengths differ, not all sinks will show equal radioactivity.\n\nTherefore, the developing flower bud will show the highest concentration of radioactivity due to its strongest sink strength during the flowering stage.\n\nEliminations:\n- A: Mature storage root—sink but typically weaker than an actively developing reproductive sink when already mature.\n- B: Stem vascular tissue—transient conduit, not a site of maximal accumulation.\n- D: Labeled mature leaf—net source, exports sucrose.\n- E: Incorrect because sink strengths are not equal.\n\nThus, the correct choice is the developing flower bud.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2315522"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the qualitative nature of sink strength, let's now quantify this process. This problem provides a simplified mathematical model to predict how a plant divides its resources between competing sinks. By considering both the pressure difference driving the flow and the physical distance to each sink, you can calculate the precise ratio of sugar allocation, moving from a conceptual understanding to a predictive, quantitative one. [@problem_id:1767526]", "problem": "A botanist is investigating resource allocation in a tomato plant using the pressure-flow hypothesis to model sugar transport in the phloem. A specific, well-illuminated source leaf is found to maintain a high hydrostatic (turgor) pressure of $P_{source} = 2.20$ MPa within its sieve-tube elements. This leaf supplies sucrose to two primary sinks: a nearby developing fruit and the distant root system.\n\nThe fruit is a very active sink, maintaining a low local phloem pressure of $P_{fruit} = 0.75$ MPa. The phloem path length from the source leaf to the fruit is $L_{fruit} = 0.30$ m. The root system is a less active sink, maintaining a phloem pressure of $P_{root} = 1.40$ MPa. The phloem path length from the source leaf to the roots is $L_{root} = 1.80$ m.\n\nAssume that the phloem sap has a uniform viscosity and that the anatomy of the sieve tubes is consistent throughout the plant. Under these conditions, the volume flow rate ($Q$) of sap through a phloem segment is given by the relation $Q = \\frac{k\\Delta P}{L}$, where $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference across the segment, $L$ is its length, and $k$ is a constant representing the hydraulic conductivity of the phloem tissue. The mass of sucrose transported is directly proportional to the volume flow rate of the sap.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total mass of sucrose allocated to the fruit to the total mass of sucrose allocated to the roots ($J_{fruit} / J_{root}$). Provide your answer as a single numerical value, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The pressure-flow hypothesis relates the volume flow rate to pressure drop and path length by $Q=\\frac{k\\Delta P}{L}$, where $k$ is the same for all similar sieve tubes. The mass transport rate of sucrose is directly proportional to $Q$, so for fruit and roots we have $J_{fruit}\\propto Q_{fruit}$ and $J_{root}\\propto Q_{root}$.

What happens to a factory if its distribution network shuts down? Similarly, what happens to a source leaf when its primary sinks are suddenly removed? This thought experiment will help you understand how the demand from sinks can regulate the rate of photosynthesis in sources, a critical concept in whole-plant physiology known as feedback inhibition. [@problem_id:2315573]", "problem": "In vascular plants, the transport of sugars, primarily in the form of sucrose, from photosynthetic source tissues (like mature leaves) to non-photosynthetic sink tissues (like roots, fruits, and developing seeds) is explained by the pressure-flow hypothesis. This model posits that the active loading of sucrose into phloem sieve-tube elements at the source creates a high solute concentration, which draws water from the adjacent xylem via osmosis. This influx of water generates high hydrostatic pressure, driving the bulk flow of the sugar-rich sap towards the sinks. At the sinks, sucrose is actively unloaded and utilized, lowering the solute concentration and causing water to return to the xylem, thus maintaining the pressure gradient.\n\nConsider a healthy, mature tomato plant during its peak fruiting season. The leaves are the primary source tissues, and the growing tomatoes are the dominant sinks, consuming a large fraction of the produced sugars. Imagine a scenario where an experimenter removes all the fruits from this plant. Based on the principles of source-sink dynamics and metabolic regulation, what is the most likely long-term consequence for the net rate of photosynthesis in the mature source leaves?\n\nA. The rate of photosynthesis will significantly increase as the plant reallocates resources towards producing more leaves and stems.\n\nB. The rate of photosynthesis will remain unaffected, as its primary limiting factors are external, such as light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration.\n\nC. The rate of photosynthesis will decrease due to the accumulation of sugars in the source leaves, leading to feedback inhibition.\n\nD. The rate of photosynthesis will fluctuate wildly as the plant attempts to establish new sinks to replace the lost fruits.\n\nE. The transport of water through the xylem will cease, causing the leaves to wilt and photosynthesis to stop immediately.", "solution": "We start from the pressure-flow hypothesis: active sucrose loading at source leaves increases phloem sap osmotic potential, water enters from xylem by osmosis, generating a high hydrostatic pressure at the source, and bulk flow carries sucrose toward sinks where active unloading lowers solute concentration and maintains a pressure gradient.\n\nRemoving all fruits eliminates the dominant sinks. This decreases total sink strength, which reduces sucrose unloading at the former sink end. According to mass flow, a reduced outflow at sinks decreases the pressure gradient along the phloem. With a smaller pressure gradient, phloem export from source leaves slows. As a result, sucrose accumulates in source leaves because its export is impaired relative to its continued production by photosynthesis.\n\nAccumulated sucrose (and derived carbohydrates, such as starch) in source leaves leads to feedback inhibition of photosynthesis via multiple regulatory layers:\n- Metabolic feedback: elevated end-product (sucrose) and increased stromal inorganic phosphate limitation constrain triose phosphate utilization, which slows the Calvin cycle.\n- Allosteric and post-translational regulation: carbohydrate status modulates key enzymes of the Calvin cycle and sucrose synthesis.\n- Transcriptional and signaling control: high sugar status (including trehalose-6-phosphate signaling and SnRK1 inhibition) represses expression of photosynthetic genes (e.g., those encoding Rubisco and other Calvin cycle enzymes), decreasing photosynthetic capacity over time.\n- Potential stomatal feedback: elevated leaf sugar can contribute to reduced stomatal conductance, further lowering net CO_{2} assimilation.\n\nTherefore, in the long term, the net rate of photosynthesis in the mature source leaves decreases due to carbohydrate accumulation and sugar-mediated feedback inhibition.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: while vegetative sinks may eventually increase, the immediate and sustained effect in the absence of strong sinks is downregulation of photosynthesis in current source leaves, not a significant increase.\n- B is incorrect: photosynthesis is also regulated by internal sink demand and carbohydrate feedback, not solely by external light and CO_{2}.\n- C is correct: removal of sinks leads to sugar accumulation in leaves and feedback inhibition, decreasing photosynthesis.\n- D is incorrect: although transient adjustments occur, the dominant long-term trend is a decrease, not wild fluctuations.\n- E is incorrect: xylem transport is driven primarily by transpiration; it does not cease upon fruit removal, and photosynthesis does not stop immediately for this reason.\n\nThus, the most likely long-term consequence is a decrease in photosynthesis due to feedback inhibition from sugar accumulation in source leaves.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2315573"}]}
