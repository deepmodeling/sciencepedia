This fundamental observation leads to a critical question: which part of the plant perceives the light, and how is that information translated into movement? This practice [@problem_id:2307937] recreates the logic of a classic experiment to demonstrate that the perception of light occurs at the tip of the growing shoot, which then sends a signal to the lower regions to control growth.", "problem": "An experiment is designed to investigate the mechanism of phototropism in young oat seedlings. The coleoptile, which is the protective sheath covering the embryonic shoot, is the subject of the study. Several groups of identical seedlings are prepared and placed in a dark environment, then exposed to a unidirectional light source coming from the right.\n\nThe experimental conditions for one specific group, Group X, are as follows: the very tip of each coleoptile is carefully covered with a small, opaque, light-proof cap that does not inhibit growth. The rest of the coleoptile remains exposed to the unidirectional light.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the growth response of the coleoptiles in Group X after several hours?\n\nA. The coleoptiles will bend towards the light source.\n\nB. The coleoptiles will bend away from the light source.\n\nC. The coleoptiles will grow straight up, showing no bending.\n\nD. The coleoptiles will cease all growth.\n\nE. The coleoptiles will bend towards the light source, but at a much slower rate than an uncovered coleoptile.", "solution": "We begin with the established mechanism of phototropism in coleoptiles as demonstrated by classic experiments (Darwin; Boysen-Jensen): the perception of directional light occurs at the coleoptile tip, where light induces a lateral redistribution of auxin. Auxin is then transported basipetally and accumulates more on the shaded side. In coleoptiles, auxin promotes cell elongation, so the shaded side elongates more than the illuminated side, producing curvature toward the light.\n\nLet $A_{\\text{sh}}$ and $A_{\\text{lit}}$ denote auxin concentrations on the shaded and illuminated sides, respectively. Let the local elongation rate be $g = f(A)$ with $f'(A)>0$ in the physiological range (auxin promotes elongation). The differential growth driving curvature satisfies\n$$\n\\Delta g \\equiv g(A_{\\text{sh}}) - g(A_{\\text{lit}}),\n$$\nand the instantaneous curvature rate satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{d\\kappa}{dt} \\propto \\Delta g.\n$$\nFor an uncovered coleoptile in unilateral light, tip perception produces $A_{\\text{sh}} > A_{\\text{lit}}$, hence $\\Delta g>0$ and the organ bends toward the light.\n\nIn Group X, the tip is covered with an opaque cap that blocks light perception without inhibiting growth. Because the site of perception and the source of lateral auxin redistribution is the tip, blocking light at the tip prevents the light-induced lateral redistribution of auxin. Basipetal transport continues, but remains symmetric with respect to the flanks; thus\n$$\nA_{\\text{sh}} = A_{\\text{lit}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Delta g = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{d\\kappa}{dt} = 0.\n$$\nTherefore, there is no bending; growth proceeds but remains straight.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because bending toward light requires tip perception, which is blocked.\n- B is incorrect because that would require relatively greater elongation on the illuminated side, which does not occur here.\n- C is correct: no bending, straight growth continues.\n- D is incorrect because growth does not cease; the cap does not inhibit growth.\n- E is incorrect because the response is not merely slower; it is absent (no curvature).\n\nHence, Group X coleoptiles grow straight up with no bending.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2307937"}, {"introduction": "While individual hormones have specific roles, much of plant development is orchestrated by the conversation between them. This exercise [@problem_id:2307946] explores the critical concept of hormonal balance, focusing on the auxin-to-cytokinin ratio, which acts like a switch to determine whether a mass of cells will grow into roots, shoots, or remain undifferentiated. Understanding this principle is key to both fundamental plant biology and modern applications like tissue culture and genetic engineering.", "problem": "In plant tissue culture, a piece of plant tissue (an explant) can be grown on a nutrient medium to form a callus, which is a mass of undifferentiated cells. The developmental fate of this callus is largely determined by the ratio of two key plant hormones in the medium: auxin and cytokinin. Typically, an intermediate ratio of auxin to cytokinin promotes the proliferation of the undifferentiated callus, a high auxin-to-cytokinin ratio stimulates root formation, and a low auxin-to-cytokinin ratio stimulates shoot formation.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered plant line in which a mutation has occurred in the gene for a cytokinin receptor. This mutation causes the receptor to be constitutively active, meaning it continuously triggers the downstream cellular response as if it were constantly bound to cytokinin, regardless of the actual concentration of cytokinin present.\n\nIf an explant from this mutant plant is placed on a culture medium containing a balance of auxin and cytokinin that would cause a normal, wild-type explant to form an undifferentiated callus, what is the most probable developmental outcome for the mutant explant?\n\nA. The explant will grow into a large, undifferentiated callus that fails to produce either roots or shoots.\n\nB. The explant will form a callus that primarily develops an extensive root system.\n\nC. The explant will form a callus that primarily develops numerous shoots but very few or no roots.\n\nD. The explant tissue will show no change and remain dormant due to conflicting hormonal signals.\n\nE. The explant will fail to divide and will undergo programmed cell death.", "solution": "To determine the outcome for the mutant plant tissue, we must first understand the roles of auxin and cytokinin in plant development and then analyze how the specific mutation alters the normal cellular response.\n\nThe development of plant tissues in culture is famously regulated by the relative concentrations of auxin and cytokinin. This relationship is a cornerstone of plant developmental biology. The key principle is the auxin-to-cytokinin ratio, which dictates the type of organogenesis that occurs from a callus:\n1.  A high ratio of auxin to cytokinin promotes the formation of roots.\n2.  A low ratio of auxin to cytokinin promotes the formation of shoots.\n3.  An intermediate ratio of both hormones leads to the proliferation of undifferentiated cells, resulting in callus growth.\n\nIn the described scenario, the explant is from a mutant plant line. The mutation causes the cytokinin receptor to be \"constitutively active.\" This means the receptor is permanently in its \"on\" state, constantly transducing a signal downstream into the cell. This signal is the same one that would normally be triggered by the binding of cytokinin. Consequently, the cell's internal machinery behaves as if it is being exposed to a very high concentration of cytokinin, even if the external concentration is low or moderate.\n\nThe mutant explant is placed on a medium with an intermediate auxin-to-cytokinin ratio. For a wild-type (normal) plant, this medium would support the growth of an undifferentiated callus, as stated in the problem. However, the mutant cells perceive the hormonal environment differently. While the auxin concentration is intermediate, the perpetually active cytokinin receptors create a *perceived* state of high cytokinin. This drastically skews the *effective* intracellular hormonal ratio. From the cell's perspective, the auxin-to-cytokinin ratio is very low (intermediate auxin signal vs. maximal cytokinin signal).\n\nBased on the established principles, a low auxin-to-cytokinin ratio is the primary trigger for shoot formation (organogenesis of shoots). Therefore, the mutant callus will not remain undifferentiated, nor will it form roots (which requires a high auxin ratio). Instead, it will be strongly induced to produce shoots. The constant, strong cytokinin signal also promotes cell division, leading to rapid growth, but this growth will be channeled into differentiation of shoots.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this reasoning:\nA. The callus will not remain undifferentiated because the perceived hormonal balance is skewed, which is a strong signal for differentiation.\nB. Root formation is stimulated by a high auxin-to-cytokinin ratio. The mutation simulates high cytokinin, creating the opposite condition.\nC. Shoot formation is stimulated by a low auxin-to-cytokinin ratio. The constitutively active cytokinin receptor creates this perceived condition, making this the most likely outcome.\nD. The cells will not remain dormant. The medium contains nutrients, and the cellular machinery is receiving strong growth and division signals from both the auxin in the medium and the constitutively active cytokinin pathway.\nE. Programmed cell death is not the expected response. A cytokinin signal is a pro-growth and pro-division signal, not a death signal. While extreme hormonal imbalance can be stressful, the primary expected phenotype relates to differentiation.\n\nTherefore, the most probable outcome is the formation of a callus that vigorously produces shoots while inhibiting root development.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2307946"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply growing towards light, plants use it to tell time and coordinate major life events like flowering with the changing seasons. This response, known as photoperiodism, often depends on measuring the length of the uninterrupted night. This practice [@problem_id:2307933] uses a classic \"night-break\" experiment to reveal the molecular machinery behind this time-keeping: a light-sensitive pigment called phytochrome that acts as a reversible switch, allowing the plant to distinguish between long and short nights.", "problem": "An agricultural botanist is investigating the flowering mechanism of a particular cultivar of chrysanthemum, which is known to be a Short-Day Plant (SDP). This means it flowers only when the length of the continuous dark period exceeds a specific critical duration. For this cultivar, the critical night length required to initiate flowering is 11 hours.\n\nThe botanist prepares four groups of these plants. All groups are grown under an identical light/dark cycle of 8 hours of light followed by 16 hours of darkness. This cycle should normally induce flowering. The four groups are treated as follows during the middle of the 16-hour dark period:\n\n- **Control Group:** The dark period is left completely uninterrupted.\n- **Group A:** The plants are exposed to a brief, intense flash of red light (wavelength ~660 nm).\n- **Group B:** The plants are exposed to a brief, intense flash of red light, which is immediately followed by a brief, intense flash of far-red light (wavelength ~730 nm).\n- **Group C:** The plants are exposed to a brief, intense flash of far-red light, which is immediately followed by a brief, intense flash of red light.\n\nAssuming the Control Group flowers as expected, which of the experimental groups (A, B, and/or C) will be inhibited from flowering?\n\nA. Group A only\n\nB. Group C only\n\nC. Groups A and B\n\nD. Groups A and C\n\nE. Groups B and C\n\nF. All three groups", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the flowering response in three experimental groups of a Short-Day Plant (SDP) whose long night period is interrupted by different light flashes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the physiology of Short-Day Plants.**\nA Short-Day Plant, contrary to its name, is more accurately described as a \"long-night plant.\" It flowers when the continuous period of darkness exceeds a certain critical length. In this problem, the critical night length is 11 hours. The experimental setup provides a 16-hour night, which is longer than the critical length, so the control group is expected to flower. The key to photoperiodic timekeeping in plants is a photoreceptor pigment called phytochrome.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the phytochrome system.**\nPhytochrome exists in two interconvertible forms:\n1.  **Pr (Phytochrome red):** This form absorbs red light (around 660 nm).\n2.  **Pfr (Phytochrome far-red):** This form absorbs far-red light (around 730 nm).\n\nThe conversion between these forms is central to the mechanism:\n- When Pr absorbs red light, it is converted to Pfr.\n- When Pfr absorbs far-red light, it is converted back to Pr.\n- In darkness, Pfr slowly and spontaneously reverts to Pr.\n\nThe biologically active form of phytochrome that regulates flowering is Pfr. In Short-Day Plants, a high concentration of Pfr *inhibits* flowering. For an SDP to flower, the Pfr concentration must drop below a certain threshold, which happens naturally during a long, uninterrupted night as Pfr reverts to Pr.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the effect of the light interruption in each group.**\nThe light interruptions occur in the middle of the 16-hour dark period (at the 8-hour mark). At this point, a significant amount of the Pfr accumulated during the preceding light period has already reverted to Pr.\n\n- **Control Group:** The 16-hour dark period is uninterrupted. Pfr levels continue to fall, dropping below the critical threshold for well over the required duration. This removes the inhibition, and the plant flowers. This confirms our baseline.\n\n- **Group A (Red light flash):** A flash of red light is absorbed by the Pr form, which is abundant after 8 hours of darkness. This converts a large amount of Pr back into Pfr. The concentration of the inhibitory Pfr form is suddenly raised, effectively \"breaking\" the long night into two 8-hour dark periods. Since neither 8-hour period is longer than the 11-hour critical night length, the condition for flowering is not met. Therefore, flowering is inhibited in Group A.\n\n- **Group B (Red light flash followed by Far-red light flash):** The initial red light flash converts Pr to Pfr, as in Group A. However, the immediate subsequent flash of far-red light is absorbed by this newly formed Pfr, converting it straight back to Pr. The effect of the red light is almost instantly reversed. The plant's phytochrome system is returned to a state with low Pfr, as if the interruption never occurred. The plant continues to experience a long, continuous night. Therefore, flowering is induced (not inhibited) in Group B.\n\n- **Group C (Far-red light flash followed by Red light flash):** The initial flash is far-red light. After 8 hours of darkness, most of the phytochrome is already in the Pr form, so there is very little Pfr to absorb the far-red light. This flash has a negligible effect. The subsequent flash of red light, however, is absorbed by the abundant Pr, converting it to Pfr. This raises the Pfr concentration and breaks the long night, just as the single red flash did in Group A. The condition for flowering is not met. Therefore, flowering is inhibited in Group C.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude which groups are inhibited.**\nBased on the analysis, both Group A and Group C will be inhibited from flowering because in both cases, the final light exposure is red light, which leads to a high concentration of the inhibitory Pfr form. Group B will flower because the final far-red flash reverses the effect of the red light.\n\nTherefore, the experimental groups that will be inhibited from flowering are A and C. This corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2307933"}]}
