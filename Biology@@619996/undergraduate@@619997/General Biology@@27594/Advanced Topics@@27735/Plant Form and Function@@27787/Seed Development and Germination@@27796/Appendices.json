They hypothesize that the balance between two key plant hormones, Abscisic Acid (ABA) and Gibberellic Acid (GA), is the critical factor determining whether a seed germinates. To test this, they prepare five batches of seeds and treat them with different aqueous solutions for 24 hours before placing them in ideal germination conditions. After seven days, they record the percentage of seeds that have germinated.\n\nThe experimental groups and their results are as follows:\n- **Group 1 (Control):** Seeds were soaked in distilled water. The germination rate was 50%.\n- **Group 2:** Seeds were treated with a solution containing 10 micromolar ($\\mu$M) ABA and 1 $\\mu$M GA.

The ratio of ABA to GA is the primary factor controlling germination, where a low ABA/GA ratio strongly promotes it.\n\nB. High absolute concentrations of GA are required to overcome dormancy, regardless of the ABA concentration.\n\nC. Dormancy is primarily determined by the absolute concentration of ABA; any concentration of ABA above 2 $\\mu$M is sufficient to induce deep dormancy.\n\nD.

Moreover, Groups 2 and 5 show that low $[G]$ does not rescue germination when $r$ is high, indicating the effect depends on ABA relative to GA, not GA alone regardless of ABA. Thus absolute $[G]$ alone is not the primary determinant.\n- Option C (absolute ABA threshold): Group 4 has $[A]=50\\,\\mu\\text{M}$ yet $g=0.97$, directly contradicting any absolute ABA threshold (such as $2\\,\\mu\\text{M}$) that would enforce deep dormancy irrespective of GA.\n- Option D (toxicity at high total hormone): Group 4 has the highest total hormone yet near-maximal $g$, contradicting a toxicity-driven decrease.\n- Option E (independence and GA absolute threshold relative to control): The data show dependence on the ratio, not independence. Additionally, referencing a fixed multiple of the control is ill-posed since the control has $[G]=0$, and the observed pattern is governed by $r$, not by an absolute GA threshold.\n\nTherefore, the most well-supported conclusion is that the ABA/GA ratio primarily controls germination, with a low ratio strongly promoting it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1741006"}, {"introduction": "The final act of germination is a dramatic escape, a biophysical feat where the embryonic radicle must physically break through its confining layers.
