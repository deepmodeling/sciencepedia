The driving variable that changes over the day is transpiration, which increases with light, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit after sunrise, typically peaking in the early afternoon, and then decreases to low levels after sunset.\n\nThe total water potential is\n$$\n\\Psi = \\Psi_{s} + \\Psi_{p} + \\Psi_{g} + \\Psi_{m}.\n$$\nIn xylem sap of a healthy, well-watered herbaceous plant, $\\Psi_{s} \\approx 0$ (dilute sap), $\\Psi_{m}$ is negligible in lumen water, and $\\Psi_{g}$ at a fixed point in the stem does not change over the daily cycle. Therefore, diurnal variation in xylem water potential at a fixed stem location is dominated by $\\Psi_{p}$, the pressure potential.\n\nTranspiration creates a water potential gradient from soil to leaf; in the xylem, this manifests as negative $\\Psi_{p}$ (tension) whose magnitude increases with transpiration demand. Qualitatively:\n- Around midnight (darkness), stomata are mostly closed, transpiration is minimal, and the xylem tension relaxes. In many well-watered herbaceous plants, root pressure can develop at night, raising xylem $\\Psi_{p}$ to values near zero or slightly positive (consistent with guttation).\n- After sunrise, stomata open and transpiration increases. This lowers leaf water potential and increases the magnitude of tension in the xylem, making $\\Psi_{p}$ progressively more negative.\n- In the early afternoon, solar intensity, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit are typically highest, so transpiration peaks and $\\Psi_{p}$ reaches its most negative values.\n- After sunset, transpiration falls, the tension relaxes, and $\\Psi_{p}$ returns toward near-zero or slightly positive values as root pressure reasserts.\n\nThis pattern corresponds to option B. The other options are inconsistent with these principles: A and D incorrectly place the most negative or positive values at night or morning, C ignores the strong diurnal modulation by transpiration, and E contradicts the cohesion-tension requirement that xylem pressure becomes negative under transpiration during the day.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2325752"}, {"introduction": "To move beyond simple concepts, scientists often use models to predict how complex systems behave.

Under moderate water stress, some regions of a leaf (patches) close their stomata to conserve water, while others remain open.

The petiole then bifurcates into two identical, non-communicating secondary veins, Vein A and Vein B. Vein A supplies a patch of tissue with open stomata and a high transpiration rate, while Vein B supplies a patch with nearly closed stomata and a low transpiration rate.\n\nThe flow of water through the xylem can be described by an equation analogous to Ohm's Law: $\\Delta \\Psi = Q \\times R_H$, where $\\Delta \\Psi$ is the drop in water potential, $Q$ is the volume flow rate of water (transpiration), and $R_H$ is the hydraulic resistance of the xylem segment.\n\nUsing the following parameters for this simplified model:\n- Water potential at the base of the petiole (supplied by the stem): $\\Psi_{stem} = -0.30 \\text{ MPa}$\n- Hydraulic resistance of the petiole: $R_{petiole} = 0.020 \\text{ MPa} \\cdot \\text{s} \\cdot \\text{µL}^{-1}$\n- Hydraulic resistance of each identical secondary vein (Vein A and Vein B): $R_{vein} = 0.050 \\text{ MPa} \\cdot \\text{s} \\cdot \\text{µL}^{-1}$\n- Transpiration rate from the patch supplied by Vein A (open stomata): $Q_{A} = 5.0 \\text{ µL} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Transpiration rate from the patch supplied by Vein B (closed stomata): $Q_{B} = 0.40 \\text{ µL} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nCalculate the ratio of the water potential at the transpiration site of the open-stomata patch ($\\Psi_A$) to that of the closed-stomata patch ($\\Psi_B$).
