This process is not simple diffusion but is governed by water potential, a concept that combines the effects of solutes and pressure. This exercise provides a practical scenario to calculate and apply water potential principles, helping you predict how a root cell will respond to osmotic stress and demonstrating a fundamental mechanism by which plants interact with their environment. [@problem_id:2308175]", "problem": "A botanist is studying osmotic stress in a common spider plant (*Chlorophytum comosum*). The water potential ($\\Psi$) of a plant cell, which dictates the direction of water movement, is determined by the sum of its solute potential ($\\Psi_s$) and pressure potential ($\\Psi_p$): $\\Psi = \\Psi_s + \\Psi_p$. The solute potential, representing the effect of dissolved solutes, is always negative or zero. The pressure potential, also known as turgor pressure, is the physical pressure exerted by the cell contents against the cell wall and is typically positive in a hydrated cell.\n\nInitially, the epidermal cells of the plant's roots are in equilibrium with a standard nutrient solution. The root cells have an average internal solute potential of $\\Psi_s = -0.7$ megapascals (MPa) and a turgor pressure of $\\Psi_p = +0.5$ MPa. By accident, the plant is then watered with a concentrated saline solution which has a water potential of $\\Psi_{solution} = -1.2$ MPa. This saline solution is at atmospheric pressure, so its pressure potential is 0 MPa.\n\nAssuming the cell membrane is permeable to water but not to the salt solutes, which of the following statements correctly describes the immediate net movement of water and the resulting change in the turgor pressure of the root cells upon exposure to the saline solution?\n\nA. Water will move from the saline solution into the root cells, causing an increase in turgor pressure.\n\nB. Water will move from the root cells into the saline solution, causing a decrease in turgor pressure.\n\nC. There will be no net movement of water because the root cells are already turgid.\n\nD. Water will move from the root cells into the saline solution, but turgor pressure will remain constant due to the structural rigidity of the cell wall.\n\nE. Salt solutes will move from the saline solution into the root cells, causing water to follow and increase turgor pressure.", "solution": "Water potential is given by $\\Psi=\\Psi_{s}+\\Psi_{p}$. Water moves spontaneously from regions of higher (less negative) $\\Psi$ to regions of lower (more negative) $\\Psi$ when the membrane is permeable to water and impermeable to solutes.\n\nCompute the initial water potential of the root cell:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{cell, initial}}=\\Psi_{s}+\\Psi_{p}=(-0.7)\\ \\text{MPa}+(+0.5)\\ \\text{MPa}=-0.2\\ \\text{MPa}.\n$$\nThe saline solution has water potential\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{solution}}=-1.2\\ \\text{MPa},\n$$\nand its pressure potential is $0$ MPa (atmospheric), so this value already reflects its net $\\Psi$.\n\nCompare potentials:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{cell, initial}}=-0.2\\ \\text{MPa}>\\Psi_{\\text{solution}}=-1.2\\ \\text{MPa}.\n$$\nTherefore, water will move from the cell (higher $\\Psi$) to the solution (lower $\\Psi$). The net driving gradient can be written as\n$$\n\\Delta \\Psi=\\Psi_{\\text{inside}}-\\Psi_{\\text{outside}}=(-0.2)-(-1.2)=+1.0\\ \\text{MPa},\n$$\nwhich being positive confirms outward water movement.\n\nAs water leaves the cell, cell volume decreases, reducing the pressure potential $\\Psi_{p}$ (turgor pressure). Hence, turgor pressure will decrease (and can approach $0$ if plasmolysis ensues), not remain constant or increase.\n\nThus, the correct statement is that water moves from the root cells into the saline solution, causing a decrease in turgor pressure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2308175"}, {"introduction": "Once water travels up the stem, it reaches the leaves, the primary site of water loss through a process called transpiration. This exercise outlines a simple yet powerful experiment to directly measure transpiration and see how an environmental factor like wind affects its rate.

This final practice explores the distinct roles of the two transport tissues within that highway—xylem and phloem—through the classic thought experiment of girdling. Analyzing the consequences of severing the phloem reveals the profound interdependence of a plant's organs and demonstrates how the entire organism functions as an integrated system. [@problem_id:2308130]", "problem": "A botanist is studying nutrient transport in a mature, healthy deciduous fruit tree. At the beginning of the growing season, just after the leaves have fully emerged, the botanist carefully removes a complete ring of tissue from the main trunk, about one meter above the ground. The cut is deep enough to remove the bark and all tissues external to the solid, woody core (the xylem). The tree is then monitored for one full year. Assuming the tree is not affected by secondary factors like disease or pests infecting the wound, which of the following descriptions most accurately predicts the sequence of observations?\n\nA. The leaves will immediately wilt, and the entire tree will die within a week because water transport from the roots has been severed.\n\nB. The tree will show no significant negative effects, as the woody core remains intact and the tree will quickly grow new tissue over the exposed ring.\n\nC. The leaves and fruit above the ring will initially appear healthy, and may even be larger than normal, but the roots will eventually starve and die, leading to the death of the entire tree in the following months.\n\nD.

The leaves and fruit will die almost immediately due to the interruption of nutrient flow, while the roots will survive by entering a dormant state until the next growing season.", "solution": "The operation described is a classic girdling: removing all tissues external to the solid woody core removes the bark, including the phloem and cambium, while leaving the xylem intact. The key transport functions are:\n- Xylem: transports water and mineral nutrients from roots to shoots, driven by transpiration and the cohesion-tension mechanism. Continuity of xylem allows continued upward water flow; severing phloem does not interrupt this.\n- Phloem: transports photosynthates (primarily sucrose) from sources (leaves) to sinks (roots, developing fruits, cambium) according to the pressure-flow (Muench) hypothesis. This requires a continuous sieve tube pathway; removing a complete ring prevents translocation across the wound.\n\nImmediately after girdling, the xylem is intact, so water potential gradients continue to drive water ascent. Thus, the leaves do not immediately wilt. Symbolically, if $\\Psi_{w}=\\Psi_{p}+\\Psi_{s}+\\Psi_{g}+\\Psi_{m}$ is the water potential and the xylem continuity is maintained, the transpirational stream persists, so shoot hydration is maintained.\n\nIn contrast, phloem transport across the girdle is interrupted. At source leaves above the ring, sucrose loading continues, increasing solute concentration in the phloem above the girdle, decreasing $\\Psi_{s}$ (more negative) and tending to raise $\\Psi_{p}$ upstream. This causes accumulation of carbohydrates above the girdle, often leading to swelling and enhanced growth of leaves and fruits above the cut, because sink demand above the cut can still be met by local phloem movement; however, no phloem translocation can pass the girdle to the roots.\n\nBelow the girdle, the roots are deprived of incoming carbohydrates. Root metabolism depends on imported photosynthate for respiration; with the phloem severed, the substrate supply for respiration declines over time. As root starch reserves are consumed and not replenished, root tissues starve and die. As roots die, water and mineral uptake from the soil declines and eventually ceases, which then secondarily compromises xylem supply to the canopy. Over subsequent months, this leads to the decline and eventual death of the aboveground parts as well.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because xylem water flow is not severed; immediate wilting does not occur.\n- B is incorrect because removal of the cambium with the bark prevents rapid regeneration of functional phloem; the physiological disruption is severe.\n- C is correct: initial health and even enlargement above the girdle due to carbohydrate accumulation, followed by root starvation and eventual death of the whole tree.\n- D is incorrect because the roots are the first to be deprived of carbohydrates; the initial problem is not lack of water in the canopy.\n- E is incorrect because leaves and fruit do not die immediately; roots cannot simply persist in a dormant state without carbohydrate supply and will die first.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that shoots above the girdle initially appear healthy and may be larger than normal, but the roots starve and die, followed by death of the entire tree in the following months, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2308130"}]}
