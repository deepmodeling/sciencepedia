{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A fundamental question in plant biology is understanding how a species reproduces—does it rely on self-pollination or must it exchange pollen with other individuals? Answering this question is crucial for conservation, agriculture, and evolutionary studies. This first practice places you in the role of a field botanist using a classic experimental design to deduce a plant's breeding system from a set of controlled observations [@problem_id:2278431]. By interpreting the results from bagging, emasculation, and hand-pollination treatments, you will learn to distinguish between self-compatibility and self-incompatibility, key factors that shape the genetic structure of plant populations.", "problem": "A botanist is studying the reproductive biology of a newly discovered angiosperm species, *Botanica investigata*. The flowers of this species are perfect, meaning they contain both male (stamens) and female (pistil) reproductive organs. To determine the plant's breeding system, the botanist conducts an experiment on 400 flowers across several individuals. The flowers are divided into four equal groups of 100.\n\n- **Group 1 (Control):** Flowers were left untouched and exposed to the natural environment, where various insects were observed visiting the flowers.\n- **Group 2 (Bagging):** Flowers were enclosed in fine-mesh bags before their stigmas became receptive. The bags prevented insects from visiting but allowed air and light to pass through.\n- **Group 3 (Emasculation and Bagging):** Before the flowers opened, their stamens were carefully removed (a process called emasculation). The flowers were then immediately enclosed in fine-mesh bags.\n- **Group 4 (Emasculation and Hand-Pollination):** Flowers were emasculated as in Group 3. Once their stigmas became receptive, they were manually dusted with pollen collected from a different plant of the same species located 100 meters away. After hand-pollination, the flowers were also enclosed in fine-mesh bags.\n\nAfter several weeks, the botanist recorded the number of flowers in each group that successfully developed into mature fruits containing seeds. The results are as follows:\n\n- **Group 1:** 82 flowers developed into fruit.\n- **Group 2:** 0 flowers developed into fruit.\n- **Group 3:** 0 flowers developed into fruit.\n- **Group 4:** 89 flowers developed into fruit.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most likely conclusion about the breeding system of *Botanica investigata*?\n\nA. The plant is an obligate self-pollinator and depends on wind, not insects, for pollination.\n\nB. The plant is capable of both self-pollination and cross-pollination, but cross-pollination is more successful.\n\nC. The plant reproduces asexually through a process like apomixis, where seeds develop without fertilization.\n\nD. The plant is an obligate cross-pollinator (outcrosser) and likely has a self-incompatibility mechanism.\n\nE. The experiment is flawed, as the process of bagging damaged the flowers, preventing any fruit development.", "solution": "We analyze each treatment against the predictions of different breeding systems.\n\n1. Interpretations of the treatments:\n- Group 1 (control, open to visitors): If the plant is animal-pollinated and compatible with cross-pollen, we expect substantial fruit set due to natural pollination.\n- Group 2 (bagged, intact flowers): If the plant can self-fertilize autonomously (autogamy) or reproduce asexually (apomixis), some fruit should set without pollinators. If it is wind-pollinated and the mesh allows airborne pollen, some fruit might also set. If it is obligately outcrossing and self-incompatible, with no pollinator access, fruit set should be near zero.\n- Group 3 (emasculated and bagged): With stamens removed and no pollen applied, only apomixis could yield fruit; otherwise, fruit set should be zero.\n- Group 4 (emasculated, hand-crossed, bagged): If cross-pollen is compatible, fruit set should be high; this also tests that bagging itself does not prevent fruit development.\n\n2. Match observations to predictions:\n- Group 2 yielded $0/100$ fruits. This rules out autonomous selfing and strongly argues against apomixis. It also argues against obligate wind pollination as the sole mechanism because, with air movement permitted, at least some fruit might be expected if wind-borne pollen could reach stigmas; moreover, the decisive comparison is with Group 4 (see below), which shows the bags themselves did not prevent fertilization or fruit development once compatible pollen was applied.\n- Group 3 yielded $0/100$ fruits, which directly rules out apomixis (no seeds without fertilization).\n- Group 4 yielded $89/100$ fruits after manual application of cross-pollen, demonstrating that outcross pollen is fully compatible and that the bagging treatment did not damage flowers or prevent fruit development.\n- Group 1 yielded $82/100$ fruits under natural visitation, consistent with effective animal-mediated pollination; the slightly lower value than Group 4 suggests natural pollination is somewhat limited compared to controlled hand-crossing, as is commonly observed.\n\n3. Synthesize the breeding system inference:\n- The complete absence of fruit in Group 2 despite the presence of anthers and stigmas within the same bag excludes autonomous selfing and, coupled with the success of hand-crossing in Group 4, points to a requirement for outcross pollen.\n- The success of Group 4 combined with the failure of Group 2 is most parsimoniously explained by self-incompatibility: self-pollen fails to fertilize, whereas cross-pollen succeeds.\n- The success of Group 1 with insect visitation identifies biotic pollination (insect pollinators) as the natural mechanism; bagging did not itself preclude fruit set once compatible pollen was supplied (Group 4), so the lack of fruit in Group 2 is not due to bag damage.\n\n4. Eliminate incorrect options:\n- A is contradicted by the lack of fruit in Group 2 and the success with insect access in Group 1; also, Group 4 shows bagging does not prevent fruit set once compatible pollen is present.\n- B is not supported because there is no evidence of successful selfing; Group 2 shows no autonomous selfing, and no treatment demonstrates successful self-pollination.\n- C is ruled out by $0/100$ in Groups 2 and 3.\n- E is ruled out because Group 4 fruits developed despite bagging.\n\nTherefore, the data support that the species is an obligate outcrosser, likely with a self-incompatibility mechanism.\n\nThe correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2278431"}, {"introduction": "Once pollination occurs, a complex series of cellular events must unfold for a seed to be created. In angiosperms, this involves the hallmark process of double fertilization. To truly understand a biological pathway, scientists often use \"knockout\" experiments—disabling one component to see what happens. This practice simulates such an experiment with a hypothetical chemical that precisely blocks a single step in the development of the male gametophyte, allowing you to explore the distinct and essential roles of the two sperm cells in forming both the embryo and the nutritive endosperm [@problem_id:2278384].", "problem": "An agronomist is testing a new experimental chemical compound designed to be a plant-specific gametocide. When applied to the stigma of a typical angiosperm flower after pollination, the compound is absorbed and has a single, highly specific effect: it completely inhibits the mitotic division of the generative cell within the pollen tube. The compound has no other effects on the pollen grain, the growth and guidance of the pollen tube, the structure or receptivity of the female gametophyte (embryo sac), or the process of syngamy (the fusion of gametes).\n\nAssume that for a treated flower, a pollen tube successfully grows down the style, penetrates an ovule, and discharges its cellular contents into a normal, mature embryo sac. Which of the following statements provides the most complete and accurate description of the ultimate outcome of this event?\n\nA. Fertilization is completely blocked, and no fusion of gametes occurs within the embryo sac.\n\nB. A diploid zygote forms, but the endosperm fails to develop, resulting in a non-viable seed.\n\nC. A triploid endosperm forms, but the zygote fails to develop, resulting in a non-viable seed.\n\nD. Both a diploid zygote and a triploid endosperm form, but the resulting embryo is sterile.\n\nE. At most, only one of the two characteristic fertilization events of an angiosperm can occur, ultimately resulting in the failure to produce a viable seed.", "solution": "Normal angiosperm pollen at germination contains a vegetative (tube) cell and a generative cell. The generative cell normally undergoes one mitotic division within the pollen tube to produce two haploid sperm cells (male gametes). This is required for double fertilization.\n\nIn double fertilization, the two sperm cells have distinct fates: one fuses with the egg cell to form the diploid zygote (ploidy $2n$), and the other fuses with the central cell (containing two polar nuclei) to form the typically triploid endosperm (ploidy $3n$). Thus, two male gametes are necessary for both fertilization events to occur.\n\nThe compound in question specifically and completely inhibits mitosis of the generative cell, while not affecting pollen tube growth, guidance, discharge, the embryo sac, or the syngamy machinery itself. Consequently, the pollen tube still reaches the embryo sac and discharges its contents, but because the generative cell did not divide, there is only a single male gamete available at discharge.\n\nWith only one male gamete present, at most one fusion event can occur: either fusion with the egg cell (yielding a zygote without endosperm) or fusion with the central cell (yielding endosperm without a zygote). In either case, the absence of one of the two products of double fertilization leads to seed failure: a zygote without endosperm typically aborts due to lack of nutritive tissue, and endosperm without an embryo does not yield a viable seed.\n\nTherefore, the most complete and accurate outcome is that at most one of the two characteristic fertilization events can occur, ultimately resulting in failure to produce a viable seed, which corresponds to option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2278384"}, {"introduction": "The processes of pollination and fertilization take place within the intricate architecture of the flower. But how does a plant build such a complex structure with its distinct rings of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels? The elegant ABC model of flower development provides the genetic blueprint. This final practice challenges you to apply the rules of this model to predict the outcome of a genetic mutation, a core skill in developmental biology [@problem_id:2278429]. By working through this thought experiment, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how simple combinations of gene expression can generate complex biological forms.", "problem": "The development of floral organs in angiosperms is governed by a genetic framework known as the ABC model. This model posits that the identity of organs developing in each of the four concentric floral whorls is determined by the differential expression of three classes of homeotic genes: A, B, and C. The four whorls, from outermost to innermost, are Whorl 1, Whorl 2, Whorl 3, and Whorl 4.\n\nThe rules for organ identity are as follows:\n- Expression of A-class genes alone in Whorl 1 specifies sepals.\n- Expression of A-class and B-class genes together in Whorl 2 specifies petals.\n- Expression of B-class and C-class genes together in Whorl 3 specifies stamens.\n- Expression of C-class genes alone in Whorl 4 specifies carpels.\n\nA key principle of this model is the mutual antagonism between A-class and C-class gene activities. Where A-class genes are expressed, C-class gene expression is repressed, and conversely, where C-class genes are expressed, A-class gene expression is repressed. In a wild-type flower, A-class genes are expressed in a gradient across Whorls 1 and 2, while C-class genes are expressed in Whorls 3 and 4. B-class genes are expressed in Whorls 2 and 3.\n\nConsider a hypothetical gain-of-function mutation that causes the C-class genes to be ectopically expressed in all four floral whorls.
