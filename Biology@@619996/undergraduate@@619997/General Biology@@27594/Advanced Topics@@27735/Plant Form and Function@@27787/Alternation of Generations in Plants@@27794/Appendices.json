Through microscopic examination of root tip cells undergoing mitosis, the ecologist determines that the diploid chromosome number for this species' sporophyte is $2n=54$. The plant follows a typical alternation of generations with double fertilization.

Therefore the haploid number is obtained by dividing by $2$, giving $n=\\frac{2n}{2}=27$.\n\nA mature male gametophyte (pollen grain) is produced by meiosis and is haploid, so any cell in the pollen grain has $n$ chromosomes, which here is $n=27$.\n\nThe seed coat develops from the maternal ovule integuments, which are part of the maternal sporophyte. Sporophytic tissues are diploid, so seed coat cells have $2n$ chromosomes, which here is $2n=54$.\n\nIn angiosperms, double fertilization yields a diploid zygote (from egg $n$ plus sperm $n$) and a triploid endosperm (from fusion of a sperm $n$ with two haploid polar nuclei $n+n$). Thus endosperm is triploid with $3n$ chromosomes, which here is $3n=81$.\n\nTherefore, the chromosome numbers for pollen grain, seed coat, and endosperm are $27$, $54$, and $81$, respectively, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1753286"}, {"introduction": "While the standard life cycle provides a clear model, nature is full of fascinating exceptions that test our understanding of the underlying rules. This practice problem explores apospory, a form of asexual reproduction where a gametophyte develops directly from a vegetative cell of the sporophyte, bypassing meiosis [@problem_id:2277267]. By applying your knowledge of mitosis and fertilization to this unconventional scenario, you will determine the ploidy of a zygote, reinforcing the principle that chromosome numbers are a direct consequence of cellular processes.", "problem": "In the typical life cycle of vascular plants, a process known as alternation of generations occurs, where a diploid ($2n$) sporophyte generation alternates with a haploid ($n$) gametophyte generation. The sporophyte produces haploid spores via meiosis, which then develop into gametophytes. These gametophytes produce haploid gametes (sperm and egg) which fuse during fertilization to form a diploid zygote, initiating the next sporophyte generation.\n\nHowever, certain plants can undergo a form of asexual reproduction called apospory. In apospory, a gametophyte develops directly from a vegetative cell of the sporophyte, completely bypassing the process of meiosis and spore formation.\n\nConsider a fern species whose normal sporophyte has a diploid chromosome number represented as 2n. One such sporophyte undergoes apospory to produce a viable, mature gametophyte. Subsequently, this aposporously-produced gametophyte undergoes self-fertilization, where a sperm cell and an egg cell produced by the same gametophyte fuse to form a zygote. What is the ploidy level of this resulting zygote?\n\nA. n\n\nB. 2n\n\nC. 3n\n\nD. 4n\n\nE. 8n", "solution": "In the normal alternation of generations of vascular plants, the sporophyte is diploid with ploidy $2n$, produces haploid spores by meiosis (reducing ploidy to $n$), spores develop into haploid gametophytes ($n$), and gametophytes produce haploid gametes by mitosis ($n$). Fusion of two haploid gametes during fertilization restores diploidy, yielding a zygote of ploidy $2n$.\n\nIn apospory, a gametophyte arises directly from a vegetative cell of the sporophyte without meiosis, so there is no reduction in chromosome number. Therefore, the aposporous gametophyte has the same ploidy as the sporophyte, namely $2n$.\n\nGametophytes produce gametes by mitosis. Because mitosis preserves ploidy, a $2n$ gametophyte will produce gametes that are also $2n$.\n\nUnder self-fertilization of this aposporous gametophyte, a $2n$ sperm fuses with a $2n$ egg. The resulting zygote inherits both complete chromosome complements:\n$$\\text{zygote ploidy} = 2n + 2n = 4n.$$\n\nThus, the zygote is tetraploid, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2277267"}, {"introduction": "The alternation of generations has profound genetic implications, particularly in plants like ferns with a free-living gametophyte where recessive alleles are immediately expressed. This advanced problem presents a scenario where a spontaneous mutation creates a genetic mosaic within a single haploid gametophyte [@problem_id:2277263]. Your challenge is to integrate your knowledge of the fern life cycle with principles of Mendelian genetics to predict the genotypes of the viable sporophytes that can arise from self-fertilization on this mosaic individual.", "problem": "A single haploid fern spore, carrying the wild-type allele `L`, germinates and begins to develop into a mature gametophyte (prothallus) through a series of mitotic divisions. Early in this development, a spontaneous somatic mutation occurs in a single cell, changing its allele from `L` to a recessive lethal allele, `l`. All descendants of this mutated cell form a distinct patch of tissue within the otherwise wild-type gametophyte, making the mature prothallus a genetic mosaic. Both the wild-type (`L`) and mutant (`l`) tissues of this single prothallus are reproductively competent and produce both antheridia (which form sperm) and archegonia (which form eggs) via mitosis.\n\nUnder favorable conditions, the gametophyte undergoes self-fertilization. Sperm from both `L` and `l` tissue types are released and are capable of fertilizing eggs in archegonia of either tissue type located on the same prothallus.

A somatic mutation early in development converts allele $L$ to $l$ in one cell, whose descendants form a mutant patch.
