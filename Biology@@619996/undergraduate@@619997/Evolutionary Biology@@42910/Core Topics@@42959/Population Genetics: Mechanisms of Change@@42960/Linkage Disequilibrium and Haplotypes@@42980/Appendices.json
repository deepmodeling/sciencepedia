This calculation demonstrates the null hypothesis against which we measure real-world genetic data. [@problem_id:1501177]", "problem": "In a large, randomly mating population of a hypothetical diploid plant species, two unlinked genetic loci are being studied. The first locus determines seed coat color, with allele 'B' for black coats and allele 'b' for brown coats. The second locus controls plant height, with allele 'T' for tall plants and allele 't' for dwarf plants. Population geneticists have surveyed the allele frequencies in the species' gene pool and found the following:\n- The frequency of the black coat allele ('B'), denoted as $p_B$, is $0.6$.\n- The frequency of the tall plant allele ('T'), denoted as $p_T$, is $0.2$.\n\nAssuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for both loci and that the loci are in linkage equilibrium, calculate the expected frequency of plants that are heterozygous at both loci (genotype $BbTt$). Report your answer as a decimal value, rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected frequency of the genotype $BbTt$ in a population under specific equilibrium conditions.\n\nFirst, we are given the frequencies of the dominant alleles at two different loci:\n- Frequency of allele 'B': $p_B = 0.6$\n- Frequency of allele 'T': $p_T = 0.2$\n\nSince there are only two alleles at each locus, the sum of the frequencies for the alleles at a single locus must be 1. We can calculate the frequencies of the recessive alleles, 'b' and 't'.\n- The frequency of the 'b' allele, $p_b$, is:\n$$p_b = 1 - p_B = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$$\n- The frequency of the 't' allele, $p_t$, is:\n$$p_t = 1 - p_T = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$$\n\nThe problem states that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for each locus. According to the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the frequency of a heterozygous genotype (e.g., $Aa$) is given by the term $2pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are the frequencies of the two alleles at that locus.\n\nWe can calculate the frequency of the heterozygous genotype $Bb$ at the seed coat color locus:\n$$f(Bb) = 2 \\times p_B \\times p_b$$\n$$f(Bb) = 2 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.4 = 0.48$$\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the frequency of the heterozygous genotype $Tt$ at the plant height locus:\n$$f(Tt) = 2 \\times p_T \\times p_t$$\n$$f(Tt) = 2 \\times 0.2 \\times 0.8 = 0.32$$\n\nThe problem also states that the two loci are in linkage equilibrium. This means that the alleles at the two loci are inherited independently. Consequently, the frequency of a two-locus genotype is the product of the frequencies of the individual single-locus genotypes.\nTo find the frequency of the genotype $BbTt$, we multiply the frequency of the $Bb$ genotype by the frequency of the $Tt$ genotype:\n$$f(BbTt) = f(Bb) \\times f(Tt)$$\n$$f(BbTt) = 0.48 \\times 0.32$$\n$$f(BbTt) = 0.1536$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value, $0.1536$, already has four significant figures. Therefore, no further rounding is needed.
