{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey of a new mutation is one of the most fundamental stories in evolution. This exercise explores the baseline scenario for this journey: the fate of a new, selectively neutral allele. You will apply a core principle of population genetics which states that for such an allele, its ultimate probability of becoming the only version in the population (fixation) is equal to its initial starting frequency, providing a direct link between population size and the power of random chance. [@problem_id:1933726]", "problem": "An isolated island supports a stable population of `399` diploid, sexually reproducing moths. All moths in this population are homozygous for a wild-type allele, `W`, which results in brown-colored wings. One day, a single moth from a different population is blown to the island by a storm and successfully integrates into the breeding population. This new moth is heterozygous, carrying the wild-type allele `W` and a novel recessive allele `w` that causes gray-colored wings. The `w` allele is selectively neutral, meaning it provides no survival or reproductive advantage or disadvantage relative to the `W` allele. Assuming the total population size remains constant and that genetic drift is the sole evolutionary force acting on this allele's frequency, what is the probability that the gray-wing allele `w` will eventually become fixed in the island population?\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We identify the total number of diploid individuals after the immigrant integrates as $N=400$ (the original $399$ plus the single newcomer). At a single biallelic locus in a diploid population, there are $2N$ gene copies. The immigrant is heterozygous $Ww$, so there is exactly one copy of the novel allele $w$ in the population initially. Therefore, the initial allele frequency is\n$$\np_{0}=\\frac{1}{2N}.\n$$\nUnder neutrality with genetic drift as the only evolutionary force, the probability that a new allele eventually fixes equals its initial frequency:\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}}=p_{0}.\n$$\nSubstituting $N=400$ gives\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}}=\\frac{1}{2\\cdot 400}=\\frac{1}{800}=0.00125,\n$$\nwhich is already at three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00125}$$", "id": "1933726"}, {"introduction": "While the ultimate fate of an allele is a key outcome, the process of genetic drift occurs step-by-step, generation by generation. This practice delves into the short-term mechanics of drift by using the classic Wright-Fisher model, which treats evolution as a random sampling process. By calculating the probability of an allele being lost in the very next generation, you will gain a tangible sense of the stochastic fluctuations that define genetic drift in small populations. [@problem_id:1933772]", "problem": "A team of conservation biologists establishes a new, isolated population of an endangered lizard species on a remote island. The founding population consists of $N=20$ diploid individuals. Through genetic analysis, it is determined that a specific neutral allele, which serves as a genetic marker, is present at an initial frequency of $p=0.1$ within this founding group. Assuming the population adheres to the assumptions of the Wright-Fisher model for reproduction (i.e., discrete, non-overlapping generations and random sampling of gametes from the gene pool), calculate the probability that this specific neutral allele is completely lost in the very next generation of offspring.\n\nProvide your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a neutral allele with an initial frequency $p$ is lost in the first generation of a diploid population of size $N$ that follows the Wright-Fisher model.\n\nIn a diploid population of size $N$, the total number of alleles at any given genetic locus is $2N$. The Wright-Fisher model assumes that the alleles for the next generation are drawn with replacement from the gene pool of the parent generation. This process is equivalent to a series of Bernoulli trials, and the number of copies of a particular allele in the next generation follows a binomial distribution.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of copies of the specific neutral allele in the next generation. The total number of 'trials' (alleles to be drawn for the next generation) is the total number of alleles in the new generation, which is $2N$. The probability of 'success' (drawing the specific allele) in any single trial is equal to its frequency in the parent generation's gene pool, which is $p$.\n\nThe probability mass function for a binomial distribution is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p_s^k (1-p_s)^{n-k}$$\nIn our context, the number of trials is $n=2N$, the probability of success is $p_s=p$, and $k$ is the number of copies of the allele in the next generation. So the formula becomes:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{2N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{2N-k}$$\n\nWe are interested in the event that the allele is \"completely lost\". This corresponds to the case where the number of copies of the allele in the next generation is zero, i.e., $k=0$.\n\nWe can substitute $k=0$ into the binomial probability formula:\n$$P(\\text{loss}) = P(X=0) = \\binom{2N}{0} p^0 (1-p)^{2N-0}$$\n\nUsing the properties of binomial coefficients and exponents, we know that $\\binom{2N}{0} = 1$ and $p^0 = 1$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$P(\\text{loss}) = (1-p)^{2N}$$\n\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values into this expression. The population size is $N=20$, and the initial allele frequency is $p=0.1$.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of alleles in the population:\n$$2N = 2 \\times 20 = 40$$\n\nNext, substitute the values of $p$ and $2N$ into the simplified formula for the probability of loss:\n$$P(\\text{loss}) = (1 - 0.1)^{40} = (0.9)^{40}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$$P(\\text{loss}) = (0.9)^{40} \\approx 0.01478088293$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are 1, 4, 7, and 8. The fifth significant figure is 0, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the fourth significant figure).\n$$P(\\text{loss}) \\approx 0.01478$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01478}$$", "id": "1933772"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary change is rarely driven by a single force; it emerges from the interplay of multiple processes. This final practice moves beyond pure neutrality to explore the crucial relationship between genetic drift and natural selection. You will determine the critical effective population size ($N_e$) at which a slightly advantageous allele transitions from being \"effectively neutral\" (where its fate is governed by drift) to being subject to the deterministic pull of positive selection, quantifying how population size acts as the arbiter between chance and selection.

They identify a novel mutation in a gene related to immune response. Through controlled experiments and sequence analysis, they determine that this new allele confers a small but consistent survival advantage, corresponding to a selection coefficient, $s$, of $0.0002$. The fate of this new advantageous mutation—whether it becomes fixed or is lost—is determined by the interplay between positive selection and random genetic drift. When the population size is small, the stochastic effects of genetic drift can be strong enough to overwhelm the directional effect of selection, causing the allele to behave as if it were neutral. Conversely, in a large population, selection is more effective and becomes the dominant force. The transition between these two evolutionary regimes occurs at a critical threshold for the effective population size ($N_e$).\n\nDetermine the threshold effective population size ($N_e$) at which this mutation transitions from being effectively neutral (drift-dominated) to being governed primarily by positive selection.
