This exercise allows you to directly apply the fundamental equation governing this process. By calculating the change in allele frequency, $\\Delta p_i$, on an \"island\" population after one generation of migration, you'll gain a tangible sense of how gene flow pulls the island's genetic makeup closer to that of the \"mainland\" source [@problem_id:1937856].", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, the one-way, or island-mainland, model of gene flow is used to predict how allele frequencies change in an isolated population (the 'island') due to migration from a large source population (the 'mainland'). The change in an allele's frequency on the island in a single generation, denoted as $\\Delta p_i$, is governed by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta p_i = m(p_m - p_i) $$\nHere, $p_i$ is the initial frequency of the allele on the island, $p_m$ is the constant frequency of the same allele on the mainland, and $m$ is the migration rate, defined as the proportion of the island population's gene pool that is composed of migrants from the mainland in each generation.\n\nConsider a small, isolated population of a particular species of fish in a mountain lake. For a gene determining scale coloration, the allele for iridescent scales ('A') has a frequency of $p_i = 0.30$ in the lake population. A very large, stable river population of the same species, which occasionally flows into the lake during flood seasons, has a frequency for the 'A' allele of $p_m = 0.90$. Biologists estimate that after a typical flood season, the proportion of the lake's gene pool derived from the river migrants is $m = 0.10$.\n\nCalculate the change in the frequency of the iridescent scale allele ('A') in the lake population after one generation of gene flow.", "solution": "The one-way island-mainland model gives the change in allele frequency on the island after one generation as\n$$\n\\Delta p_{i} = m\\left(p_{m} - p_{i}\\right).\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $m = 0.10$, $p_{m} = 0.90$, and $p_{i} = 0.30$,\n$$\n\\Delta p_{i} = 0.10 \\times \\left(0.90 - 0.30\\right) = 0.10 \\times 0.60 = 0.06.\n$$\nThus, the allele frequency increases by $0.06$ after one generation of gene flow.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.06}$$", "id": "1937856"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary forces often work in opposition to one another, creating a dynamic balance. This practice explores the crucial concept of a gene flow-selection balance, where the homogenizing pressure of migration counteracts the diversifying pressure of local natural selection. By determining the change in allele frequency due to migration, $\\Delta p_m$, required to maintain equilibrium, you will see how gene flow can preserve alleles that would otherwise be eliminated by selection on an island [@problem_id:1937792].", "problem": "Consider an isolated island population of a plant species. A single gene with two alleles, 'A' and 'a', controls a trait crucial for survival in the island's unique environment. Let $p$ be the frequency of the dominant allele 'A'. On this island, individuals with the 'A' allele have a significant reproductive advantage, causing natural selection to favor this allele. The change in the frequency of allele 'A' due to selection alone, in a single generation, is denoted as $\\Delta p_s$ and has been determined to be $\\Delta p_s = 0.015$.\n\nHowever, the island is not completely isolated. Each year, wind carries a substantial amount of pollen from a large continental population where the recessive allele 'a' is much more common. This influx of genetic material through migration (gene flow) influences the island's allele frequencies. The change in the frequency of allele 'A' due to migration alone is denoted as $\\Delta p_m$.\n\nLong-term ecological studies have revealed that the frequency $p$ of the 'A' allele in the island population remains constant from generation to generation, indicating that the population is in a state of equilibrium with respect to these two evolutionary forces. Assume that the effects of mutation and genetic drift are negligible in this context.\n\nCalculate the value of $\\Delta p_m$, the change in the frequency of allele 'A' per generation caused by migration.", "solution": "Let $p$ denote the frequency of allele $A$ in generation $t$. The total change in allele frequency across one generation due to the combined effects of selection and migration is\n$$\n\\Delta p=\\Delta p_{s}+\\Delta p_{m},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta p_{s}$ is the change due to selection alone and $\\Delta p_{m}$ is the change due to migration alone.\n\nAt equilibrium, the allele frequency remains constant from generation to generation, so\n$$\np_{t+1}-p_{t}=\\Delta p=0.\n$$\nTherefore, the contributions from selection and migration must cancel:\n$$\n\\Delta p_{s}+\\Delta p_{m}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Delta p_{m}=-\\Delta p_{s}.\n$$\n\nGiven $\\Delta p_{s}=0.015$, we substitute to obtain\n$$\n\\Delta p_{m}=-0.015.\n$$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that migration decreases the frequency of allele $A$, counterbalancing the increase caused by selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.015}$$", "id": "1937792"}, {"introduction": "While we can model gene flow generation by generation, we can also infer its long-term impact by examining patterns of genetic differentiation across populations. This exercise introduces the Fixation Index, $F_{ST}$, a widely used metric in population genetics, to quantify the homogenizing power of gene flow over evolutionary time. You will use a standard formula to estimate the effective number of migrants per generation, $N_e m$, a key parameter that reflects how connected populations are and how strongly gene flow prevents them from diverging [@problem_id:1937836].", "problem": "A team of conservation biologists is studying two geographically separated populations of an endangered amphibian, the Azure Dart Frog (*Dendrobates azureus*), found in two distinct forest patches separated by a valley.
