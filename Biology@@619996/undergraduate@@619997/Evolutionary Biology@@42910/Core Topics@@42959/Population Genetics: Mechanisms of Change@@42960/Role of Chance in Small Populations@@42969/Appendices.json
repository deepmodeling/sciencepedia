While natural selection favors beneficial alleles, the fate of a neutral allele—one that confers no advantage or disadvantage—is left entirely to chance. This exercise provides a fundamental tool for quantifying the odds of survival for such an allele, demonstrating the core principle that its ultimate probability of becoming the only version in the population (fixation) is determined by its initial frequency [@problem_id:1961110]. By working through this scenario, you will gain a direct appreciation for how population size shapes the power of genetic drift from the moment a new genetic variant appears.", "problem": "A group of conservation biologists has established a new, isolated breeding population of a rare species of flightless bird on a remote island. The founding population consists of 60 diploid, sexually reproducing individuals. Shortly after their introduction, a spontaneous and selectively neutral mutation occurs on a single chromosome within a single bird. Assuming no further mutations at this genetic locus and no migration to or from the island, calculate the probability that this new variant of the gene will eventually become the only version present in the entire population.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a new, neutral mutation will reach fixation in a small, isolated population. The key principle governing this process is genetic drift.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of gene copies (alleles) for the locus in question within the entire population. The population is described as diploid, meaning each individual carries two alleles for each autosomal gene. The population size, denoted by $N$, is given as 60 individuals.\nThe total number of alleles in the gene pool is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Total alleles} = 2 \\times N = 2 \\times 60 = 120\n$$\n\nNext, we identify the initial frequency of the new mutant allele. The problem states that the mutation arises on a single chromosome in a single individual. This means there is exactly one copy of the new mutant allele in the entire gene pool at the moment of its appearance.\n\nThe initial frequency, $p$, of a new allele is the number of copies of that allele divided by the total number of alleles in the population.\n$$\np = \\frac{\\text{Number of copies of the new allele}}{\\text{Total number of alleles}} = \\frac{1}{2N}\n$$\n\nA fundamental result in population genetics, established by Motoo Kimura, states that for a selectively neutral allele, its probability of eventually becoming fixed in the population (i.e., reaching a frequency of 1.0) is equal to its initial frequency.\n\nTherefore, the probability of fixation for this new neutral mutation is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{fixation}} = p = \\frac{1}{2N}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given population size $N=60$ into this formula gives:\n$$\nP_{\\text{fixation}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 60} = \\frac{1}{120}\n$$\n\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to three significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{120} \\approx 0.0083333...\n$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, we look at the first three non-zero digits (8, 3, 3) and the fourth digit (3). Since the fourth digit is less than 5, we do not round up the third digit.\n$$\nP_{\\text{fixation}} \\approx 0.00833\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00833}$$", "id": "1961110"}, {"introduction": "In our models, we often use a stable population size, $N$, but real-world populations rarely remain constant. They grow, shrink, and sometimes experience dramatic crashes known as bottlenecks. This practice explores a crucial concept in evolutionary and conservation biology: the effective population size, $N_e$. This value, not the simple average size, is what determines the actual magnitude of genetic drift. This exercise will guide you through calculating $N_e$ for a fluctuating population, revealing why bottlenecks have a disproportionately large and lasting impact on genetic diversity, even long after census numbers recover [@problem_id:1961084].", "problem": "A population of field voles in an isolated meadow experienced a severe bottleneck. Wildlife biologists recorded the census population size for four consecutive generations as 400, 30, 25, and 500.
