The species has recently undergone a severe population bottleneck, but has since recovered and is now mating randomly.", "solution": "The problem asks us to interpret a set of fixation indices ($F$-statistics) to deduce the population structure of a plant species. The key is to understand what each index represents and how they relate to one another.\n\nThe three main fixation indices are $F_{IS}$, $F_{ST}$, and $F_{IT}$. They are related by the equation:\n$$ (1 - F_{IT}) = (1 - F_{IS})(1 - F_{ST}) $$\n\nLet's define each term in the context of the problem:\n- $F_{IS}$ (the inbreeding coefficient) measures the reduction in heterozygosity of an individual due to non-random mating within its subpopulation (a single meadow). A value of $F_{IS} \\approx 0$ indicates that mating within each meadow is effectively random, consistent with Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). A positive value would indicate inbreeding.\n- $F_{IT}$ (the overall fixation index) measures the reduction in heterozygosity of an individual relative to the total population (all meadows combined). It compares the observed heterozygosity in an individual to the expected heterozygosity if the entire species were a single, randomly mating population. A positive value indicates a deficit of heterozygotes at the species level.\n- $F_{ST}$ (the among-subpopulation fixation index) measures the reduction in heterozygosity due to genetic differentiation among subpopulations. It quantifies how much of the total genetic variation is due to differences in allele frequencies between the meadows. A value near 0 means all meadows have similar allele frequencies, while a value near 1 means they are fixed for different alleles.\n\nWe are given:\n- $F_{IS} = 0.01$\n- $F_{IT} = 0.45$\n\nWe can use the relationship between the indices to solve for $F_{ST}$:\n$$ (1 - F_{IT}) = (1 - F_{IS})(1 - F_{ST}) $$\n$$ 1 - 0.45 = (1 - 0.01)(1 - F_{ST}) $$\n$$ 0.55 = (0.99)(1 - F_{ST}) $$\n$$ 1 - F_{ST} = \\frac{0.55}{0.99} \\approx 0.5556 $$\n$$ F_{ST} = 1 - 0.5556 \\approx 0.4444 $$\n\nSo, we find that $F_{ST} \\approx 0.44$. This is a high value for $F_{ST}$, which indicates significant genetic differentiation among the subpopulations (the meadows). The allele frequencies for the $A_1$ and $A_2$ alleles are very different from one meadow to another.\n\nThis pattern, where subpopulations are individually in HWE ($F_{IS} \\approx 0$) but the total pooled population shows a strong deficit of heterozygotes ($F_{IT} > 0$), is a classic example of the Wahlund effect. The overall deficit of heterozygotes is not caused by inbreeding within populations, but by the population structure itself—the existence of distinct subpopulations with different allele frequencies.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. High gene flow would homogenize allele frequencies between meadows, leading to a very low $F_{ST}$. This contradicts our calculated high $F_{ST}$. So, this is incorrect.\n\nB. Strong assortative mating (a form of inbreeding) within each meadow would lead to a significant positive $F_{IS}$, indicating a heterozygote deficit within the subpopulations. The problem states $F_{IS} \\approx 0$, which contradicts this option. So, this is incorrect.\n\nC. This option states the species is highly structured with significant genetic differentiation and divergent allele frequencies among meadows. This is exactly what a high $F_{ST}$ value implies. This is the correct interpretation of the data.\n\nD. Strong selection favoring heterozygotes (balancing selection) would lead to an excess of heterozygotes compared to HWE expectations. This would result in negative F-statistics ($F_{IT} < 0$ and/or $F_{IS} < 0$), which is the opposite of what is observed ($F_{IT} = 0.45$). So, this is incorrect.\n\nE. A population bottleneck followed by random mating might explain an overall loss of diversity, but if mating is random across the entire species range, we would expect both $F_{IT}$ and $F_{IS}$ to be close to zero. The high $F_{IT}$ indicates the population is not acting as a single random-mating unit. So, this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only conclusion supported by the genetic data is that the species is divided into genetically distinct populations corresponding to the isolated meadows.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1930038"}, {"introduction": "Genetic differentiation is often shaped by the landscape on which populations live. This practice challenges you to apply your knowledge of $F_{ST}$ to interpret spatial genetic patterns, a core skill in landscape genetics. By comparing scenarios with and without a correlation between genetic differentiation ($F_{ST}$) and geographic distance, you will learn to infer the underlying migration processes by distinguishing between an island model and a stepping-stone model of gene flow [@problem_id:1930036].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the population genetic structure of a species of freshwater snail that inhabits a series of isolated ponds. The biologist samples snails from numerous ponds in two large, geographically distinct regions, Region A and Region B. For each region, a large number of pairwise comparisons are made between ponds, calculating the geographic distance and the fixation index ($F_{ST}$) for each pair. The fixation index, $F_{ST}$, measures the genetic differentiation between two populations, with values ranging from 0 (no differentiation) to 1 (complete differentiation).\n\nThe analysis reveals two starkly different patterns:\n- In Region A, the pairwise $F_{ST}$ values between ponds are all clustered around a mean value of 0.15, showing no discernible correlation with the geographic distance separating the ponds.\n- In Region B, there is a strong, positive correlation between the pairwise $F_{ST}$ and geographic distance. Ponds that are close to each other have low $F_{ST}$ values (approaching 0), while ponds that are far apart have high $F_{ST}$ values (approaching 0.6).\n\nAssuming that the effective population size ($N_e$) of snails within any given pond and the per-generation mutation rates are reasonably uniform across all ponds in both regions, which of the following statements provides the most likely explanation for the observed difference in the spatial genetic patterns between Region A and Region B?\n\nA. The snail populations in Region A are structured according to a one-dimensional stepping-stone model, while those in Region B are structured according to an island model.\n\nB. The snail populations in Region A are structured according to an island model, while those in Region B are structured according to a one-dimensional stepping-stone model.\n\nC. Both regions follow an island model of population structure, but the overall migration rate among ponds in Region B is significantly lower than in Region A.\n\nD. Both regions follow a one-dimensional stepping-stone model, but the effective population size ($N_e$) of ponds in Region A is much larger than in Region B.\n\nE. The patterns observed are a direct consequence of different mutation rates in the two regions, with Region B having a substantially higher rate than Region A.", "solution": "We identify the key population-genetic expectations linking spatial structure, migration, and genetic differentiation. At migration–drift equilibrium and under neutrality with uniform per-generation mutation rate across demes, the expected differentiation depends primarily on how migration connects populations in space.\n\n1) Under Wright’s island model with symmetric migration among many demes, the equilibrium differentiation is independent of geographic distance. The standard result is\n$$\nF_{ST}=\\frac{1}{4N_{e}m+1},\n$$\nwhere $N_{e}$ is the effective population size per deme and $m$ is the per-generation fraction of migrants entering each deme from the metapopulation. Because all demes exchange migrants equally regardless of geographic distance, pairwise $F_{ST}$ values do not covary with distance; they fluctuate around a constant mean determined by $N_{e}$ and $m$. Therefore, a pattern with all pairwise $F_{ST}$ clustered near a common mean and no correlation with geographic distance is the hallmark of an island model. The observation in Region A (pairwise $F_{ST}$ clustered around a mean with no distance effect) matches this prediction.\n\n2) Under spatially restricted dispersal (stepping-stone models), nearby demes exchange migrants more than distant ones. At equilibrium, this generates isolation by distance: genetic differentiation increases with geographic distance. For a one-dimensional stepping-stone (linear habitat), theory predicts a linear increase of the kinship or relatedness-based differentiation with distance, often expressed as\n$$\n\\frac{F_{ST}}{1-F_{ST}} \\approx a + b\\, d,\n$$\nfor sufficiently large distance $d$, where $a$ is an intercept and $b$ is proportional to the inverse of neighborhood size, for example $b \\propto \\frac{1}{4D\\sigma^{2}}$ with $D$ the effective density and $\\sigma^{2}$ the parent–offspring dispersal variance. In two dimensions, the prediction becomes\n$$\n\\frac{F_{ST}}{1-F_{ST}} \\approx a + \\frac{1}{4\\pi D\\sigma^{2}} \\ln(d),\n$$\nagain implying a positive association with distance. In both cases, ponds that are closer are expected to have smaller $F_{ST}$ than those farther apart. The observation in Region B (strong positive correlation of $F_{ST}$ with distance, from near zero among nearby ponds to large values among distant ponds) matches a stepping-stone model with limited dispersal.\n\n3) Evaluation of alternatives:\n- Option A (Region A stepping-stone, Region B island) is inconsistent because Region A shows no distance dependence, which contradicts stepping-stone predictions, while Region B shows strong isolation by distance, which contradicts the island model.\n- Option B (Region A island, Region B one-dimensional stepping-stone) matches the theoretical expectations detailed above: Region A’s distance-independent $F_{ST}$ fits the island model, and Region B’s isolation-by-distance pattern fits a stepping-stone model.\n- Option C (both island, but different migration rates) cannot generate a distance correlation in Region B because, under the island model, $F_{ST}$ is independent of geographic distance for any $m$; changing $m$ shifts the overall mean (via $F_{ST}=\\frac{1}{4N_{e}m+1}$) but does not induce a spatial trend.\n- Option D (both one-dimensional stepping-stone, but different $N_{e}$) would produce isolation by distance in both regions; changing $N_{e}$ alters the magnitude (intercept/slope via neighborhood size) but not the qualitative presence of a positive distance correlation. Region A lacks such a correlation, so this is inconsistent.\n- Option E (different mutation rates) is ruled out by the stated assumption of uniform mutation rates and, in any case, mutation primarily affects absolute diversity rather than generating a distance-dependent pattern of $F_{ST}$; the spatial trend is driven by dispersal structure.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is that Region A follows an island model and Region B follows a one-dimensional stepping-stone model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1930036"}]}
