This advanced problem demonstrates how Wright's F-statistics can be used to distinguish between causes like population structure (the Wahlund effect), inbreeding, and diversifying selection. [@problem_id:1976629] Engaging with this scenario, which compares a neutral locus with one under selection, will equip you to interpret complex population genetic data and build a compelling evolutionary narrative.", "problem": "A population biologist is investigating the evolutionary forces acting on the wildflower *Silene prospecta*, which grows in a landscape characterized by distinct patches of serpentine soil (rich in heavy metals) and non-serpentine soil. It is hypothesized that the population is subdivided based on soil type, with local adaptation occurring. To test this, the biologist collects a large number of individuals from both soil types, creating a single pooled sample for genetic analysis.\n\nTwo genetic loci are genotyped for all individuals:\n1.  **Locus T**: A Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) within a gene known to be involved in conferring tolerance to heavy metals.\n2.  **Locus N**: A neutral microsatellite locus located on a different chromosome, assumed to be unlinked to Locus T and not under direct selection.\n\nInitial analysis of the pooled sample reveals a significant deficit of heterozygotes at both loci compared to the expectations of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). To further dissect the causes, the biologist calculates Wright's F-statistics by treating the plants from the two soil types as distinct subpopulations. The results are summarized below:\n\n| Locus | $F_{IS}$ (Deficit within subpopulations) | $F_{ST}$ (Differentiation between subpopulations) | $F_{IT}$ (Total deficit in pooled sample) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Locus T | 0.015 | 0.600 | 0.609 |\n| Locus N | 0.020 | 0.200 | 0.216 |\n\nBased on these F-statistics, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and parsimonious explanation for the observed patterns of genetic variation?\n\nA. The population is experiencing strong, uniform inbreeding, which causes a large heterozygote deficit. The effect is more pronounced at Locus T due to its lower mutation rate compared to the microsatellite at Locus N.\n\nB. The population is panmictic (not subdivided), and the heterozygote deficits are caused by underdominance (selection against heterozygotes) acting independently at both Locus T and Locus N.\n\nC. The heterozygote deficit at both loci is primarily due to the Wahlund effect. The much larger differentiation ($F_{ST}$) at Locus T compared to Locus N is evidence of diversifying selection acting on Locus T.\n\nD. The system exhibits associative overdominance, where heterozygotes at the neutral Locus N have higher fitness. The deficit at Locus T is a result of random genetic drift overwhelming selection.\n\nE. The primary cause of the heterozygote deficit is the Wahlund effect for Locus N and strong inbreeding for Locus T, indicating different mating systems are associated with different alleles at Locus T.", "solution": "Wright’s F-statistics partition heterozygote deficit as follows. Let $F_{IS}$ be the within-subpopulation inbreeding coefficient (departure from Hardy–Weinberg within subpopulations), $F_{ST}$ be the measure of allele-frequency differentiation among subpopulations, and $F_{IT}$ be the total inbreeding coefficient in the pooled sample. The standard identity is\n$$\n1 - F_{IT} = (1 - F_{IS})(1 - F_{ST}),\n$$\nwhich implies\n$$\nF_{IT} = 1 - (1 - F_{IS})(1 - F_{ST}).\n$$\nFor Locus T, substituting the reported values gives\n$$\n1 - F_{IT} = (1 - 0.015)(1 - 0.600) = 0.985 \\times 0.400 = 0.394,\n$$\nso\n$$\nF_{IT} = 1 - 0.394 = 0.606,\n$$\nwhich is essentially equal to the reported $0.609$ (small discrepancy attributable to rounding). For Locus N,\n$$\n1 - F_{IT} = (1 - 0.020)(1 - 0.200) = 0.980 \\times 0.800 = 0.784,\n$$\nso\n$$\nF_{IT} = 1 - 0.784 = 0.216,\n$$\nexactly matching the reported value. Thus, at both loci, the large heterozygote deficits observed in the pooled sample are quantitatively explained by the Wahlund effect, i.e., pooling differentiated subpopulations.\n\nNext, interpret $F_{IS}$. The values $F_{IS}=0.015$ (Locus T) and $F_{IS}=0.020$ (Locus N) indicate very small within-subpopulation departures from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, inconsistent with strong inbreeding. Therefore, explanations invoking strong, uniform inbreeding are contradicted by the data.\n\nInterpret $F_{ST}$. The neutral Locus N shows $F_{ST}=0.200$, indicating moderate subdivision between soil types. Locus T shows much larger $F_{ST}=0.600$. Since both loci experience the same demographic subdivision, an elevated $F_{ST}$ at Locus T relative to the neutral background is best explained by diversifying (local) selection on Locus T, consistent with its known functional role in metal tolerance and the contrasting soil environments.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is inconsistent because $F_{IS}$ is small, not “strong, uniform inbreeding,” and mutation rate differences do not produce the observed pattern of $F_{ST}$.\n- B is ruled out because substantial $F_{ST}$ at both loci contradicts panmixia; underdominance at both loci is unnecessary and unparsimonious.\n- C matches the quantitative decomposition via $F_{IT}=1-(1-F_{IS})(1-F_{ST})$, identifies the Wahlund effect as the primary cause of heterozygote deficit in the pooled sample, and correctly interprets the elevated $F_{ST}$ at Locus T as evidence of diversifying selection.\n- D is inconsistent because associative overdominance would produce heterozygote excess at the neutral locus, not a deficit, and does not explain the strong locus-specific elevation of $F_{ST}$ at Locus T.\n- E conflicts with the small $F_{IS}$ at Locus T, which does not indicate strong inbreeding.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and parsimonious explanation is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1976629"}]}
