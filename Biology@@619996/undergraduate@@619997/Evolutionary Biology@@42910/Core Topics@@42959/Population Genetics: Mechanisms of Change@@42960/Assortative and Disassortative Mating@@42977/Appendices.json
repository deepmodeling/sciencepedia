This first practice problem models a common scenario: positive assortative mating, where individuals choose mates with similar phenotypes. By tracking genotype frequencies for one generation starting from a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, you will directly calculate how this mating pattern shifts the genetic makeup of a population, providing a foundational understanding of its impact on homozygosity. [@problem_id:1909846]", "problem": "In a remote, isolated ecosystem, biologists have discovered a species of flowering plant, *Aesthetica electa*, whose petal color is determined by a single gene locus with two codominant alleles: $R_1$ for red pigment and $R_2$ for white pigment. This codominance results in three distinct phenotypes: homozygous $R_1R_1$ plants have red flowers, homozygous $R_2R_2$ plants have white flowers, and heterozygous $R_1R_2$ plants have pink flowers.\n\nInitial surveys of a large, stable population of these plants reveal that it is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic analysis shows that the frequencies of the $R_1$ and $R_2$ alleles are both exactly 0.5.\n\nA specialized pollinator is introduced to this ecosystem. This pollinator displays extreme color preference, leading to one generation of complete positive assortative mating. That is, pollen from a red-flowered plant will only fertilize another red-flowered plant, pollen from a white-flowered plant will only fertilize a white-flowered plant, and pollen from a pink-flowered plant will only fertilize another pink-flowered plant.\n\nCalculate the expected genotype frequencies for $R_1R_1$, $R_1R_2$, and $R_2R_2$ in the cohort of seeds produced after this single generation of complete positive assortative mating.

Complete positive assortative mating by phenotype therefore implies mating occurs only within each genotype class. Assuming equal fecundity across classes and a large population, the contribution of each mating class to the seed cohort is proportional to its parental frequency.\n\nWithin-class offspring distributions follow Mendelian segregation:\n- $R_{1}R_{1} \\times R_{1}R_{1} \\to$ all offspring $R_{1}R_{1}$.\n- $R_{2}R_{2} \\times R_{2}R_{2} \\to$ all offspring $R_{2}R_{2}$.\n- $R_{1}R_{2} \\times R_{1}R_{2}$: each parent produces $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ gametes with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, so random union of gametes yields\n$$\n\\Pr(R_{1}R_{1})=\\frac{1}{4}, \\quad \\Pr(R_{1}R_{2})=\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\Pr(R_{2}R_{2})=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nWeighting by the initial genotype frequencies, the seed-cohort genotype frequencies after one generation of complete positive assortative mating are\n$$\nF_{11}=f_{11}+\\frac{1}{4}f_{12}, \\quad F_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}f_{12}, \\quad F_{22}=f_{22}+\\frac{1}{4}f_{12}.\n$$\nSubstituting $f_{11}=\\frac{1}{4}$, $f_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}$, and $f_{22}=\\frac{1}{4}$ gives\n$$\nF_{11}=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3}{8}, \\quad\nF_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}, \\quad\nF_{22}=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3}{8}.\n$$\nAs a check, the allele frequencies are conserved: $F_{11}+\\frac{1}{2}F_{12}=\\frac{3}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $F_{22}+\\frac{1}{2}F_{12}=\\frac{3}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}=\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{8} & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{3}{8} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1909846"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to the homogenizing effect of assortative mating, disassortative mating promotes diversity by favoring matings between dissimilar individuals.
