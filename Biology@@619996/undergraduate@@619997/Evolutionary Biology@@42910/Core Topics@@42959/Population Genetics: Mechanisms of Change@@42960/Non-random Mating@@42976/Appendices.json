Faced with an observed lack of heterozygotes for a flower color gene, you must distinguish between two plausible hypotheses: population-wide inbreeding or trait-specific assortative mating. This problem challenges you to think critically about the genomic signatures of different mating systems and propose a genetic analysis that could provide definitive evidence for one over the other [@problem_id:1506209].", "problem": "A population geneticist is studying a wild plant population. They focus on a single genetic locus that determines flower color. This locus has two codominant alleles, $A_1$ and $A_2$. Genotypes $A_1A_1$ produce red flowers, $A_2A_2$ produce white flowers, and heterozygotes $A_1A_2$ produce pink flowers. After sampling a large number of individuals, the geneticist observes the genotype frequencies and calculates the allele frequencies. They discover a statistically significant deficit of heterozygotes (pink-flowered plants) compared to the frequencies expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Two primary hypotheses are proposed to explain this observation: (1) a substantial level of population-wide inbreeding, such as a high rate of self-fertilization, or (2) strong positive assortative mating, where pollinators preferentially move between flowers of the same color.\n\nWhich of the following experimental plans provides the most direct and conclusive genetic evidence to distinguish between these two hypotheses?\n\nA. Genotype all sampled individuals for several additional polymorphic and selectively neutral loci (e.g., microsatellites or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)) that are known to be unlinked to the flower color locus.\nB. Conduct a detailed field study to track pollinator movements and quantify the rate at which they move between plants of the same versus different flower colors.\nC. Increase the sample size of the initial population survey for just the flower color locus, in order to confirm the observed heterozygote deficit with higher statistical power.\nD. Perform a controlled-cross experiment in a greenhouse, mating red-flowered plants with white-flowered plants, and analyze the phenotype ratios in the F1 and F2 generations to confirm the mode of inheritance.\nE. Sequence the complete DNA of the flower color locus from a subset of individuals representing all three phenotypes to check for cryptic structural variations within the gene.", "solution": "Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with allele frequencies $p$ and $q=1-p$ at a codominant locus, the expected genotype frequencies are $A_{1}A_{1}: p^{2}$, $A_{1}A_{2}: 2pq$, and $A_{2}A_{2}: q^{2}$. A deficit of heterozygotes means that the observed heterozygosity $H_{O}$ is less than the expected heterozygosity $H_{E}=2pq$.\n\nTwo genetic mechanisms predict distinct multilocus patterns:\n- Inbreeding (including self-fertilization) increases homozygosity genome-wide. Under an inbreeding coefficient $F$, the single-locus genotype frequencies become\n$$\nA_{1}A_{1}: p^{2}+Fpq,\\quad A_{1}A_{2}: 2pq(1-F),\\quad A_{2}A_{2}: q^{2}+Fpq.\n$$\nThus, the heterozygote deficit scales by the same factor at any unlinked, selectively neutral locus: for any such locus $i$ with allele frequencies $p_{i},q_{i}$,\n$$\nH_{O,i}=2p_{i}q_{i}(1-F),\\quad H_{E,i}=2p_{i}q_{i},\\quad F_{IS,i}=1-\\frac{H_{O,i}}{H_{E,i}}=F,\n$$\nso $F_{IS}$ should be consistently positive across many unlinked neutral loci.\n\n- Positive assortative mating based on flower color affects homozygosity primarily at the flower color locus (and possibly tightly linked loci), but not at unlinked neutral loci. If mating is random with respect to all other loci, then for any unlinked neutral locus $i$,\n$$\nH_{O,i}\\approx H_{E,i}=2p_{i}q_{i},\\quad F_{IS,i}\\approx 0,\n$$\nwhile at the flower color locus, $H_{O}<H_{E}$ due to mating among like phenotypes.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and conclusive genetic test is to assay multiple unlinked, selectively neutral markers and compare observed versus expected heterozygosity at each locus, or equivalently estimate $F_{IS}$ per locus. A genome-wide excess of homozygosity (positive $F_{IS}$ across neutral loci) supports population-wide inbreeding; a locus-specific deficit confined to the flower color locus with neutral loci near Hardy-Weinberg expectations supports positive assortative mating specific to flower color.\n\nAmong the options, only plan A implements this multilocus, unlinked neutral marker test and yields a decisive genetic distinction. Plans B, C, D, and E do not provide multilocus genetic evidence that can discriminate inbreeding from assortative mating: B is behavioral and indirect; C increases precision at one locus but cannot distinguish mechanisms; D confirms inheritance mode already implied by codominance and does not address mating system; E tests for structural variation at the focal gene but not the mating pattern.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1506209"}]}
