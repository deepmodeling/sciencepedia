{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The census population size, $N$, often overstates the genetic resilience of a population. A more accurate measure is the effective population size, $N_e$, which reflects the size of an idealized population that would experience the same magnitude of genetic drift. This first exercise focuses on one of the most common factors that causes $N_e$ to be lower than $N$: an unequal number of breeding males and females. You will apply a fundamental formula to calculate $N_e$ in a conservation context, seeing firsthand how the less numerous sex can limit a population's genetic diversity [@problem_id:1921519].", "problem": "A conservation biology team is managing a captive breeding program for a critically endangered species of island fox to preserve its genetic diversity. The program's current breeding cohort consists of a specific number of sexually mature males and females. Due to logistical constraints and behavioral compatibility, the breeding group is composed of 8 males and 42 females. Assuming that all individuals in their respective sex categories have an equal opportunity to breed and contribute gametes to the next generation, calculate the effective population size ($N_e$) for this breeding cohort.\n\nProvide your answer as a number rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The effective population size for a dioecious species with unequal numbers of breeding males and females, assuming equal opportunity to contribute gametes within each sex, is given by Wright’s formula:\n$$\nN_{e}=\\frac{4N_{m}N_{f}}{N_{m}+N_{f}}.\n$$\nHere, the number of breeding males is $N_{m}=8$ and the number of breeding females is $N_{f}=42$.

This practice explores how such fluctuations, particularly severe population crashes known as bottlenecks, impact the long-term effective population size. You will learn to use the harmonic mean, which demonstrates that periods of small population size have a disproportionately large effect on reducing the overall $N_e$ [@problem_id:1921521]. This calculation is essential for understanding the enduring genetic scars left by historical population declines.", "problem": "A population of rare arctic poppies, *Papaver radicatum*, grows in an isolated valley. Field biologists have been monitoring this population for several years, conducting a census at the end of each flowering season, which corresponds to one generation. In the first year of the study, the census population size was 2000 individuals. However, a severe, unseasonable frost at the beginning of the second year's growing season caused a drastic population crash. Over a four-year (and thus four-generation) period, the census population sizes were recorded as 2000, 30, 1500, and 2200 individuals, respectively.\n\nFluctuations in population size can have a significant impact on the long-term genetic drift experienced by the population. This is quantified by the effective population size ($N_e$), which is the size of an idealized population that would experience the same amount of genetic drift as the actual population under study.\n\nAssuming discrete, non-overlapping generations and no other complicating factors (such as unequal sex ratios or variance in reproductive success), calculate the effective population size for this four-generation period.

Variation in reproductive success—where some individuals have many offspring while others have none—also reduces the effective population size. This final exercise introduces a method to calculate $N_e$ by incorporating the variance in offspring number, $V_k$, revealing a more subtle but powerful force that influences the rate of genetic drift [@problem_id:1921498].
