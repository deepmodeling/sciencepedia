{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The most direct way to measure the genetic makeup of a population is to count the different versions of a gene, or alleles. This practice problem provides a classic scenario where this is possible using co-dominant genetic markers, where the phenotype directly reveals the genotype. By analyzing the results of a hypothetical gel electrophoresis experiment, you will practice the fundamental skill of calculating allele frequencies directly from observed genotype counts, a technique that forms the foundation of all population genetics analysis [@problem_id:1912320].", "problem": "A team of population geneticists is studying a specific enzyme in a species of insect that inhabits a remote island. This enzyme's gene locus has two co-dominant alleles, which we will call $E_1$ and $E_2$. The co-dominance means that the phenotype of an individual, as determined by protein gel electrophoresis, directly reveals its genotype. An individual with genotype $E_1E_1$ will show a single \"fast-migrating\" band on the gel. An individual with genotype $E_2E_2$ will show a single \"slow-migrating\" band. A heterozygous individual, with genotype $E_1E_2$, will show both bands.\n\nThe researchers collected a sample of 50 insects from the island population. After analyzing the enzyme from each insect using gel electrophoresis, they observed the following results:\n- 10 individuals showed only the fast-migrating band.\n- 25 individuals showed both the fast- and slow-migrating bands.\n- 15 individuals showed only the slow-migrating band.\n\nBased on this sample, calculate the frequency of the $E_2$ allele (the 'slow' allele) in the population. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "Because the alleles are co-dominant, each phenotype reveals the genotype counts directly. Let $n_{11}=10$ (genotype $E_{1}E_{1}$), $n_{12}=25$ (genotype $E_{1}E_{2}$), $n_{22}=15$ (genotype $E_{2}E_{2}$), and total sample size $N=50$. Each individual carries two alleles, so the total number of alleles is $2N$. The total number of $E_{2}$ alleles is $2n_{22}+n_{12}$, since each $E_{2}E_{2}$ contributes two $E_{2}$ alleles and each heterozygote contributes one.\n\nTherefore, the sample frequency of the $E_{2}$ allele is\n$$\nf_{E_{2}}=\\frac{2n_{22}+n_{12}}{2N}.\n$$\nSubstituting the observed counts,\n$$\nf_{E_{2}}=\\frac{2\\cdot 15+25}{2\\cdot 50}=\\frac{55}{100}=0.55.\n$$\nRounded to two significant figures, this is $0.55$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.55}$$", "id": "1912320"}, {"introduction": "Often, we cannot distinguish all genotypes simply by observing an organism's traits, especially when dominant alleles mask the presence of recessive ones. This common situation requires a more inferential approach to determine the underlying genetic frequencies. This exercise will guide you through using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principle—a cornerstone of population genetics—to estimate allele frequencies from phenotype data alone. It demonstrates the power of theoretical models in situations where direct counting is not possible, while also emphasizing the importance of the underlying assumptions, such as random mating in a large population [@problem_id:1912351].", "problem": "A team of microbiologists is studying a population of extremophilic bacteria isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. They have identified a single gene responsible for tolerance to high concentrations of the heavy metal cadmium. The gene has two alleles: a dominant allele $T$ which confers tolerance, and a recessive allele $t$ which results in susceptibility. The population is assumed to be large and randomly mating, and thus in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to this gene.\n\nTo determine the allele frequencies, the researchers collected a random sample of 12,500 individual bacteria. They cultured each bacterium to form a colony and then tested the phenotype of each colony by replica plating onto a growth medium containing a high concentration of cadmium. They observed that 450 of the colonies failed to grow, indicating they were susceptible to cadmium.\n\nBased on this experimental data, calculate the frequency of the dominant tolerance allele $T$ in this bacterial population. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $p$ be the frequency of the dominant allele $T$ and $q$ be the frequency of the recessive allele $t$, with $p+q=1$. Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies are $p^{2}$ for $TT$, $2pq$ for $Tt$, and $q^{2}$ for $tt$. The susceptible phenotype corresponds to the homozygous recessive genotype $tt$, so its frequency is $q^{2}$.\n\nFrom the data, the observed frequency of susceptible colonies is the sample proportion\n$$\nq^{2}=\\frac{450}{12500}=\\frac{9}{250}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nq=\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{250}}=\\frac{3}{5\\sqrt{10}}.\n$$\nThe frequency of the dominant allele is\n$$\np=1-q=1-\\frac{3}{5\\sqrt{10}}.\n$$\nFor the required numerical value rounded to three significant figures,\n$$\np=1-\\frac{3}{5\\sqrt{10}}\\approx 0.810263\\ldots \\approx 0.810.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.810}$$", "id": "1912351"}, {"introduction": "The principles of allele counting are universal and extend beyond the simple diploid systems often used as initial examples. Many organisms, particularly in the plant kingdom, are polyploid, meaning they carry more than two sets of chromosomes. This practice problem challenges you to apply the fundamental allele counting method to a tetraploid organism. By doing so, you will reinforce your understanding that an allele's frequency is simply its proportion within the total gene pool, regardless of the ploidy level or how those alleles are packaged into individuals [@problem_id:1912334].", "problem": "A population of a specific potato variety (*Solanum tuberosum*) is studied for a gene controlling skin color. This variety is tetraploid, meaning each individual plant carries four alleles for this gene.
