This first exercise explores one of its most fundamental consequences: how a population, regardless of its initial genotype frequencies, will reach Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after just one generation of random mating. By calculating the expected genotype frequencies for a newly founded population of tree frogs, you will directly apply this principle and see how allele frequencies dictate the genetic structure of the next generation [@problem_id:1495618].", "problem": "A conservation genetics team is establishing a new, protected reserve population for a species of rare tree frog. The skin coloration of this frog is determined by a single gene with two alleles, $R$ and $r$. Genotype $RR$ results in a red-spotted pattern, $Rr$ results in an orange-spotted pattern, and $rr$ results in a yellow-spotted pattern.\n\nTo create the new population, individuals are pooled from two separate captive-breeding programs. The first program contributes 200 red-spotted frogs ($RR$) and 100 orange-spotted frogs ($Rr$). The second program contributes 450 yellow-spotted frogs ($rr$).\n\nThese two groups are released together into the reserve, forming a single, new founding population. Assuming that this new population mates randomly and that all other Hardy-Weinberg conditions (no selection, no mutation, no migration, and a very large population size) are met, what are the expected genotype frequencies for the red-spotted ($RR$), orange-spotted ($Rr$), and yellow-spotted ($rr$) frogs in the first generation of offspring?\n\nProvide the three frequencies as decimal values, in the order $f(RR)$, $f(Rr)$, and $f(rr)$.

This practice puts you in the role of a population geneticist tasked with determining if a real-world beetle population is evolving. By comparing the observed genotype counts from a field sample to the numbers expected under HWE, you will learn how to detect deviations that signal processes like non-random mating or population subdivision [@problem_id:1495590].", "problem": "A population geneticist is investigating the genetic structure of a specific population of the scarab beetle, *Phanaeus vindex*. A single gene locus is known to control the primary color of the elytra (wing coverings), and the two alleles at this locus, which we will denote as $A_1$ and $A_2$, are codominant. The genotype $A_1A_1$ results in a brilliant blue-green phenotype, the genotype $A_2A_2$ results in a reflective red-copper phenotype, and the heterozygous genotype $A_1A_2$ produces a distinct intermediate bronze phenotype.\n\nIn a survey of a large, isolated meadow, the geneticist captures, phenotypes, and genotypes a random sample of 500 beetles. The observed genotype counts from this sample are as follows:\n- 200 individuals with genotype $A_1A_1$ (blue-green)\n- 100 individuals with genotype $A_1A_2$ (bronze)\n- 200 individuals with genotype $A_2A_2$ (red-copper)\n\nTo assess whether this population is currently in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, you are asked to perform a comparison. First, use the observed genotype counts to calculate the frequencies of the $A_1$ and $A_2$ alleles in the sample. Then, calculate the number of heterozygous ($A_1A_2$) individuals that would be expected in a sample of this size if the population were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with these allele frequencies. Finally, determine the absolute difference between the observed number of heterozygotes and this calculated expected number.", "solution": "The problem asks for the absolute difference between the observed and expected number of heterozygous individuals in a sample of 500 beetles. The expected number is to be calculated assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we must determine the allele frequencies from the observed genotype counts.\nLet $N$ be the total number of individuals in the sample.\n$N = 500$\nThe observed counts for each genotype are:\n- Number of $A_1A_1$ individuals, $N_{A_1A_1} = 200$\n- Number of $A_1A_2$ individuals, $N_{A_1A_2} = 100$\n- Number of $A_2A_2$ individuals, $N_{A_2A_2} = 200$\n\nThe total number of alleles in the gene pool of this sample is $2N$, because each diploid individual has two alleles.\nTotal alleles = $2 \\times 500 = 1000$.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of copies of each allele. The number of $A_1$ alleles is twice the number of $A_1A_1$ homozygotes plus the number of $A_1A_2$ heterozygotes.\nNumber of $A_1$ alleles = $(2 \\times N_{A_1A_1}) + N_{A_1A_2} = (2 \\times 200) + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500$.\n\nThe frequency of the $A_1$ allele, denoted as $p$, is the number of $A_1$ alleles divided by the total number of alleles.\n$p = \\frac{\\text{Number of } A_1 \\text{ alleles}}{\\text{Total alleles}} = \\frac{500}{1000} = 0.5$.\n\nSimilarly, we calculate the number of copies of the $A_2$ allele.\nNumber of $A_2$ alleles = $(2 \\times N_{A_2A_2}) + N_{A_1A_2} = (2 \\times 200) + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500$.\n\nThe frequency of the $A_2$ allele, denoted as $q$, is the number of $A_2$ alleles divided by the total number of alleles.\n$q = \\frac{\\text{Number of } A_2 \\text{ alleles}}{\\text{Total alleles}} = \\frac{500}{1000} = 0.5$.\nAs a check, the sum of the allele frequencies should be 1: $p + q = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0$.\n\nNow, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to calculate the expected genotype frequencies. For a population in equilibrium, the expected frequency of heterozygotes ($A_1A_2$) is given by $2pq$.\nExpected frequency of $A_1A_2$ = $2pq = 2 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.5$.\n\nWith this expected frequency, we can calculate the expected number of heterozygous individuals in a sample of 500.\nExpected number of $A_1A_2$ = (Expected frequency of $A_1A_2$) $\\times$ (Total sample size)\nExpected number of $A_1A_2$ = $0.5 \\times 500 = 250$.\n\nThe problem provides the observed number of heterozygous individuals, which is $N_{A_1A_2} = 100$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the absolute difference between the observed and expected number of heterozygotes.\nAbsolute Difference = $| \\text{Observed number of } A_1A_2 - \\text{Expected number of } A_1A_2 |$\nAbsolute Difference = $|100 - 250| = |-150| = 150$.\n\nThe absolute difference between the observed and expected number of heterozygotes is 150. This large discrepancy indicates that the population is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A deficit of heterozygotes like this could be caused by factors such as non-random (assortative) mating or population subdivision (the Wahlund effect).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{150}$$", "id": "1495590"}, {"introduction": "The standard Hardy-Weinberg model is built on the assumption of autosomal inheritance, but its principles can be adapted to other genetic systems.
