{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our exploration of genetic drift, we start with the most fundamental scenario: the emergence of a single, new mutation. This exercise explores the fate of a selectively neutral allele in a simple haploid population. By calculating its initial frequency and ultimate probability of fixation, you will grasp the core principle that, in the absence of selection, an allele's chance of taking over the entire population is simply its starting proportion [@problem_id:1929733]. This foundational concept is the bedrock upon which more complex models of drift are built.", "problem": "In a large, isolated laboratory culture of a haploid bacterium, the population size is maintained at a constant number, $N$. A spontaneous mutation occurs in a single bacterium, giving rise to a new allele at a specific genetic locus. This new allele is selectively neutral, meaning it confers no reproductive advantage or disadvantage compared to the original allele. The fate of this new allele will be determined solely by genetic drift.\n\nAmong the following statements, which one correctly describes both the initial frequency of this new neutral allele in the population and its ultimate probability of fixation (i.e., the probability that it will eventually be the only allele present at that locus in the entire population)?\n\nA. The initial frequency is $\\frac{1}{N}$, and the probability of fixation is $\\frac{1}{N}$.\n\nB. The initial frequency is $\\frac{1}{2N}$, and the probability of fixation is $\\frac{1}{2N}$.\n\nC.

The initial frequency is $\\frac{1}{N}$, but the probability of fixation cannot be determined without knowing the mutation rate.", "solution": "The problem asks for two quantities related to a new neutral mutation in a haploid population of size $N$: its initial frequency and its probability of fixation. We will determine each quantity step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's determine the initial frequency of the new allele. The population consists of $N$ haploid individuals. This means there are a total of $N$ copies of the gene (allele) in question within the entire population. The problem states that the new mutation arises in a single bacterium. Therefore, there is exactly one copy of the new mutant allele, and the remaining $N-1$ copies are the original (wild-type) allele.\n\nThe frequency of an allele is defined as the number of copies of that allele divided by the total number of copies of all alleles for that gene in the population.\nLet $p_0$ be the initial frequency of the new allele.\n$$p_0 = \\frac{\\text{Number of copies of the new allele}}{\\text{Total number of alleles in the population}}$$\nIn this case, the number of copies of the new allele is 1, and the total number of alleles is $N$.\n$$p_0 = \\frac{1}{N}$$\n\nSecond, let's determine the probability of fixation of this new allele. A fundamental result of population genetics, particularly from the neutral theory of molecular evolution, states that for a selectively neutral allele, its probability of eventually becoming fixed in the population is equal to its current frequency. This is because, under pure genetic drift, every allele present in the current generation has an equal chance of being the ancestor of all alleles in a distant future generation.\n\nSince the allele is new, its \"current\" frequency is its initial frequency, $p_0$.\nLet $P_{\\text{fix}}$ be the probability of fixation.\n$$P_{\\text{fix}} = p_0$$\nSubstituting the value we found for $p_0$:\n$$P_{\\text{fix}} = \\frac{1}{N}$$\n\nTherefore, the initial frequency of the new allele is $\\frac{1}{N}$, and its probability of fixation is also $\\frac{1}{N}$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. The initial frequency is $\\frac{1}{N}$, and the probability of fixation is $\\frac{1}{N}$. This matches our derivation.\nB. The initial frequency is $\\frac{1}{2N}$, and the probability of fixation is $\\frac{1}{2N}$. This would be correct for a new mutation in a single individual in a diploid population of size $N$, where the total number of alleles is $2N$. The problem specifies a haploid population.\nC. The initial frequency is $\\frac{1}{N}$, and the probability of fixation is $1$. This is incorrect. A fixation probability of 1 would imply the allele is certain to take over, which would require an extremely strong selective advantage, not neutrality.\nD. The initial frequency is $1$, and the probability of fixation is $\\frac{1}{N}$. An initial frequency of 1 means the allele is already fixed, which contradicts the scenario of a new mutation in a single individual.\nE. The initial frequency is $\\frac{1}{N}$, but the probability of fixation cannot be determined without knowing the mutation rate. The mutation rate determines how often new alleles arise, but the fixation probability of an *existing* neutral allele depends only on its frequency and the population size (which is embedded in the frequency calculation), not the rate at which other new mutations might appear.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1929733"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational principle, let's apply our understanding to a more realistic scenario involving diploid organisms and a founder event. This practice challenges you to determine the fate of a rare allele introduced into a new environment by a small group of founders [@problem_id:1929704]. The key here is to carefully calculate the initial allele frequency in the specific founding group, reinforcing the direct link between an allele's starting frequency and its probability of fixation, even when the population's starting composition is complex.", "problem": "A small group of geckos is stranded on a remote, uninhabited island after a severe storm, establishing a new, isolated population. The founding group consists of a single male and $N_f$ females. These geckos are diploid organisms.

Assuming the population size grows significantly in subsequent generations, and that mating occurs randomly, what is the probability that the 'A' allele eventually becomes fixed in the island population? Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $N_f$.", "solution": "We model the allele dynamics under neutral genetic drift in a large, randomly mating diploid population. For a selectively neutral autosomal allele, the probability of eventual fixation equals its initial frequency among all gene copies that contribute to future generations.\n\nFirst, compute the initial allele counts in the founding population. There are $N_f + 1$ diploid individuals (one male and $N_f$ females), so the total number of autosomal gene copies is\n$$\n2(N_f + 1).\n$$\nThe male is heterozygous $Aa$, contributing exactly one copy of allele $A$ and one copy of allele $a$.
