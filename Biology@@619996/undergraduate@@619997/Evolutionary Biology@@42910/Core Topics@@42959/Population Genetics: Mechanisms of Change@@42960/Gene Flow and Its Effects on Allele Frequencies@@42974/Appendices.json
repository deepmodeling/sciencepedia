This foundational exercise demonstrates how to determine the new genetic makeup of a population immediately after a group of migrants is introduced.

The first is a small, isolated wild population consisting of 190 individuals located in the Whispering Reeds sanctuary. Genetic analysis of this population reveals that the frequency of a particular allele, 'R', which is associated with resistance to a common fungal pathogen, is 0.1. The second population is a captive-bred group at a conservation center, which has been selectively managed to enhance disease resistance. This captive group consists of a large number of frogs, and the frequency of the same 'R' allele is 0.9.\n\nTo bolster the genetic health and size of the wild population, the conservation team decides to introduce 10 frogs from the captive-bred population into the Whispering Reeds sanctuary. Assuming these 10 frogs successfully integrate into the wild population and that mating occurs randomly with respect to this allele, calculate the new frequency of the 'R' allele in the combined sanctuary population immediately following this introduction event.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the wild population have size $N_{w}=190$ with allele $R$ frequency $p_{w}=0.1$, and the captive group introduced have size $N_{c}=10$ with allele $R$ frequency $p_{c}=0.9$.

This practice explores the classic \"mainland-island\" model, which is essential for understanding how persistent migration shapes a population's genetic structure over time.

The founding population established on the island is from a single captive-bred lineage that is homozygous for a recessive allele, 'g', which results in a standard green coloration. Consequently, the initial frequency of the dominant allele 'B', which confers a brilliant blue coloration, is zero in the island's new population.\n\nEach generation, a fraction of the island's damselfly population is composed of new individuals that migrate from a large, stable mainland population. This migration is exclusively from the mainland to the island. In the mainland population, the blue allele 'B' is fixed, meaning its frequency is exactly 1.0. The migration rate, symbolized by $m$, represents the proportion of the island population that consists of new migrants in any given generation. This rate is constant at $m = 0.12$.\n\nAssuming that after the migrants arrive each generation, the entire island population mates randomly, what will be the frequency of the blue allele 'B' on the island after two generations?
