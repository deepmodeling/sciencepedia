Before we can explore the evolutionary forces that change populations, we must first learn how to describe their current genetic makeup. This first practice provides a direct, hands-on opportunity to calculate allele frequencies from observed genotype counts, a fundamental skill for any student of evolution.

The color of its lower petals is determined by a single gene with two alleles. The allele $C^B$ is dominant and results in blue petals, while the allele $C^W$ is recessive and results in white petals. A field biologist collects and genotypes a random sample of 200 plants from this population. The survey yields the following counts for the three possible genotypes:\n\n-   Homozygous dominant ($C^BC^B$): 128 individuals\n-   Heterozygous ($C^BC^W$): 64 individuals\n-   Homozygous recessive ($C^WC^W$): 8 individuals\n\nBased on this sample, calculate the frequencies of the $C^B$ allele and the $C^W$ allele in this population.

This means that only fireflies with the homozygous recessive genotype, `ff`, will exhibit the short-flash phenotype.\n\nWe are given that the frequency of fireflies with the short-flash pattern is 0.16.
