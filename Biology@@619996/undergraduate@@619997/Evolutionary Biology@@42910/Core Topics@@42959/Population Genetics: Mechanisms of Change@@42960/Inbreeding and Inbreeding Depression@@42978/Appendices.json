A primary effect of inbreeding is a reduction in heterozygosity, which can expose deleterious recessive alleles and lead to inbreeding depression. This problem [@problem_id:1940031] demonstrates how to use a known inbreeding coefficient, $F$, to predict the actual frequency of heterozygotes in a population, connecting the abstract coefficient to a tangible change in genetic structure.", "problem": "A conservation program for the critically endangered Kakapo, a flightless parrot native to New Zealand, begins with a small founding population. Genetic analysis of this population reveals a single gene locus with two alleles, $A_1$ and $A_2$, that influences immune system response.

After several generations of breeding within this isolated group, pedigree analysis shows that the average inbreeding coefficient ($F$) for the current generation has risen to $0.25$. Assuming no selection, mutation, or migration has occurred, calculate the expected frequency of heterozygous ($A_1A_2$) individuals in the current generation.\n\nProvide your answer as a decimal rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires us to calculate the expected frequency of heterozygotes in a population with a known allele frequency and a given level of inbreeding.\n\nFirst, we identify the given parameters. The frequency of the $A_1$ allele is $p = 0.8$. Since there are only two alleles at this locus, the frequency of the $A_2$ allele, denoted by $q$, must be:\n$$q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\nThe inbreeding coefficient is given as $F = 0.25$.\n\nIn a large, randomly mating population, the expected frequency of heterozygotes would be determined by the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). The HWE frequency of heterozygotes, which we can denote as $H_0$, is given by the formula:\n$$H_0 = 2pq$$\nSubstituting the allele frequencies, we find the expected heterozygote frequency in the absence of inbreeding:\n$$H_0 = 2(0.8)(0.2) = 0.32$$\n\nInbreeding causes a reduction in the frequency of heterozygotes compared to the HWE expectation. The inbreeding coefficient, $F$, represents the proportional reduction in heterozygosity. The frequency of heterozygotes in the inbred population, denoted as $H_F$, is related to the HWE frequency, $H_0$, by the following equation:\n$$H_F = H_0 (1 - F)$$\nThis can also be written directly in terms of the allele frequencies and the inbreeding coefficient:\n$$H_F = 2pq(1 - F)$$\n\nWe can now substitute the values for $H_0$ and $F$ into the formula to find the heterozygote frequency in the current, inbred generation:\n$$H_F = (0.32)(1 - 0.25)$$\n$$H_F = (0.32)(0.75)$$\nCarrying out the multiplication:\n$$H_F = 0.24$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. Our calculated value, $0.24$, already has exactly two significant figures (the '2' and the '4'). Thus, no further rounding is necessary. The expected frequency of heterozygous individuals is $0.24$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.24}$$", "id": "1940031"}, {"introduction": "Inbreeding is not a static property; it accumulates over generations, particularly in small, isolated populations. This dynamic relationship between the rate of inbreeding and the effective population size, $N_e$, is a central concept in conservation biology. This final practice [@problem_id:1940016] presents a practical scenario where you will use observed changes in the inbreeding coefficient over time to estimate the effective size of a population, turning this theoretical concept into a powerful diagnostic tool.", "problem": "A conservation team has established a small, isolated breeding population of the critically endangered Iberian Rock Lizard (*Iberolacerta monticola*) in a protected mountain habitat. To monitor the genetic health and the risk of inbreeding depression, the team conducts a genetic survey in two consecutive, non-overlapping generations. The analysis of molecular markers provides an estimate of the average inbreeding coefficient, $F$, for the population. In the first generation surveyed (generation $t-1$), the inbreeding coefficient was found to be $F_{t-1} = 0.35$. In the subsequent generation (generation $t$), the value increased to $F_{t} = 0.38$. Assuming the population is closed (no migration) and approximates a Wright-Fisher model of random mating, calculate the effective population size, $N_e$, during the interval between these two generations.\n\nExpress your answer as an exact fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "The problem asks for the effective population size, $N_e$, given the inbreeding coefficients for two consecutive generations, $F_{t-1}$ and $F_t$. We can solve this by using the standard recurrence relation that describes the change in the inbreeding coefficient over one generation in a finite population under the assumptions of the Wright-Fisher model.\n\nThe inbreeding coefficient in generation $t$, denoted as $F_t$, is the probability that two alleles at a locus, drawn at random from an individual, are identical by descent. This can be related to the inbreeding coefficient of the previous generation, $F_{t-1}$, and the effective population size, $N_e$. An individual in generation $t$ can be inbred in two ways:\n1. The two alleles are copies of the *same* parental allele from generation $t-1$. The probability of picking the same parent twice is $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$ (since there are $2N_e$ alleles in the gene pool).\n2. The two alleles are copies of *different* parental alleles from generation $t-1$. The probability of this is $1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}$. In this case, the alleles are identical by descent only if the two parental alleles were themselves identical by descent. The probability for this is, by definition, $F_{t-1}$.\n\nCombining these two mutually exclusive possibilities gives the total probability $F_t$:\n$$F_t = \\left(\\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) \\cdot 1 + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) \\cdot F_{t-1}$$\nThis is the fundamental recurrence relation for the inbreeding coefficient. Our goal is to solve this equation for $N_e$.\n\nFirst, we rearrange the equation algebraically to isolate the term containing $N_e$:\n$$F_t = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + F_{t-1} - \\frac{F_{t-1}}{2N_e}$$\nMove the $F_{t-1}$ term to the left side:\n$$F_t - F_{t-1} = \\frac{1}{2N_e} - \\frac{F_{t-1}}{2N_e}$$\nFactor out the $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$ term on the right side:\n$$F_t - F_{t-1} = \\frac{1 - F_{t-1}}{2N_e}$$\nNow, we can solve for $N_e$ by multiplying both sides by $2N_e$ and dividing by $(F_t - F_{t-1})$:\n$$2N_e (F_t - F_{t-1}) = 1 - F_{t-1}$$\n$$N_e = \\frac{1 - F_{t-1}}{2(F_t - F_{t-1})}$$\nThis expression gives the effective population size as a function of the inbreeding coefficients in two successive generations.\n\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values into this expression. We are given:\n$F_{t-1} = 0.35$\n$F_{t} = 0.38$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula for $N_e$:\n$$N_e = \\frac{1 - 0.35}{2(0.38 - 0.35)}$$\nFirst, calculate the values in the numerator and the denominator:\n$$1 - 0.35 = 0.65$$\n$$0.38 - 0.35 = 0.03$$\nSo the expression becomes:\n$$N_e = \\frac{0.65}{2(0.03)}$$\n$$N_e = \\frac{0.65}{0.06}$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 100 to remove the decimals:\n$$N_e = \\frac{65}{6}$$\nThe fraction $\\frac{65}{6}$ is already in its simplest form, as 65 has prime factors 5 and 13, while 6 has prime factors 2 and 3.
