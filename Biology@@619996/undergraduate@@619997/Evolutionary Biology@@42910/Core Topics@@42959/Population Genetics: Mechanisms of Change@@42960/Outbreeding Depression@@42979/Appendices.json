Population A originates from a cool, moist coastal environment, while Population B comes from a hot, arid inland region. These populations have been evolving independently for many generations.\n\nTo assess the fitness effects of crossing these populations, the biologist conducts a controlled breeding experiment. The fitness of individuals is quantified using a composite metric called Lifetime Reproductive Success (LRS), which integrates survival to adulthood, mating success, and total number of viable offspring. The LRS values are normalized relative to the inland population.\n\nThe experiment yielded the following mean LRS values for each group:\n\n*   **Parental Cross (A × A):** The average LRS for offspring from within the coastal population is 0.96.\n*   **Parental Cross (B × B):** The average LRS for offspring from within the inland population is 1.00.\n*   **F1 Hybrid Cross:** Offspring from crosses between Population A and Population B (both A♂ × B♀ and B♂ × A♀) have an average LRS of 1.12.\n*   **F2 Hybrid Cross:** Offspring produced by intercrossing the F1 hybrids (F1 × F1) have an average LRS of 0.75.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following evolutionary phenomena is most clearly demonstrated by the sharp change in fitness observed in the F2 generation?\n\nA.

Compute the difference between the F1 and the best parent:\n$$w_{F1}-\\max\\{w_{AA},w_{BB}\\}=1.12-1.00=0.12>0.$$\nThis inequality indicates that F1 hybrids exceed both parental lines in fitness, which is the signature of heterosis (hybrid vigor). Thus, the F1 result is consistent with heterosis.\n\nAssess the F2 outcome relative to the parents and F1. First, compare F2 to the worse parent:\n$$w_{F2}-\\min\\{w_{AA},w_{BB}\\}=0.75-0.96=-0.21<0,$$\nso F2 is less fit than either parent. Also, compare F2 to F1:\n$$w_{F2}-w_{F1}=0.75-1.12=-0.37<0,$$\nso there is a sharp drop from F1 to F2.\n\nInterpretation based on genetic principles:\n- Heterosis in F1 commonly arises from dominance complementation and favorable epistasis when divergent populations are crossed.\n- A sharp reduction in F2 fitness relative to both parents and the F1 is expected when recombination breaks up coadapted gene complexes and reveals negative epistatic interactions (e.g., Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities). This phenomenon is termed hybrid breakdown and is a canonical manifestation of outbreeding depression, which typically appears in F2 or later generations because recombination and segregation generate maladaptive allele combinations.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A (Genetic drift): A stochastic change in allele frequencies at the population level; it does not explain the systematic F1 elevation and F2 collapse observed in controlled crosses.\n- B (Inbreeding depression): Results from increased homozygosity exposing deleterious recessives within a single population, typically evident in consanguineous matings; the pattern here arises from interpopulation crosses and recombination-driven breakdown, not classical inbreeding within a lineage.\n- C (Outbreeding depression): Reduced fitness due to mating between genetically divergent populations that disrupts coadapted gene complexes; classically most evident in F2 and later. This matches the sharp F2 fitness drop.\n- D (Heterosis): Explains the F1 elevation, but the question asks for the phenomenon most clearly demonstrated by the sharp change in the F2 generation.\n- E (Founder effect): A demographic sampling phenomenon; not relevant to these cross-type fitness patterns.\n\nTherefore, the sharp reduction in F2 fitness most clearly demonstrates outbreeding depression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1951938"}, {"introduction": "Once we observe a pattern like outbreeding depression, the next scientific step is to propose and test a mechanism.

The protein product of the nuclear allele $N_A$ interferes with cellular respiration in the presence of the mitochondrial haplotype $M_B$. Consequently, the fitness of any individual possessing at least one $N_A$ allele *and* the $M_B$ mitochondrial haplotype is multiplied by a factor of $(1-s_m)$, where $s_m$ is the mito-nuclear selection coefficient ($0  s_m  1$).
