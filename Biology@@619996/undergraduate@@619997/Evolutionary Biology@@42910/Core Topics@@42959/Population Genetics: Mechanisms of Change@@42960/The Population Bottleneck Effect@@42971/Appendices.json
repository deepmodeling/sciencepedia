This first exercise provides a quantitative look at this process, allowing you to directly calculate the erosion of heterozygosity. By comparing a brief but severe population crash with a longer, more moderate reduction, you will gain a practical understanding of how both the effective population size, $N_e$, and the duration of the bottleneck, $t$, dictate the severity of its genetic impact.

Two isolated populations, Population A and Population B, are monitored. Initially, both populations are large and exhibit the same level of genetic diversity, characterized by an average heterozygosity of $H_0$.\n\nPopulation A experiences a sudden and severe environmental collapse. Its effective population size plummets to $N_A = 20$ individuals for a single generation ($t_A = 1$). After this single generation, conservation efforts are successful, and the population recovers to its original large size.\n\nPopulation B, located in a different region, suffers from prolonged habitat fragmentation. Its effective population size is reduced to $N_B = 40$ individuals, and it remains at this diminished size for five consecutive generations ($t_B = 5$) before conditions improve and the population recovers.\n\nFor the purposes of this model, assume that for an ideal population, the decrease in heterozygosity ($H$) from one generation to the next is governed by genetic drift, and that the population sizes before and after the bottleneck events are sufficiently large that their contribution to the loss of heterozygosity can be neglected. The effective population size is equal to the census size during the bottleneck.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the heterozygosity remaining in Population A ($H_A'$) to the heterozygosity remaining in Population B ($H_B'$) immediately after their respective bottleneck periods have concluded.

A single, dominant allele, denoted as R, has recently emerged that confers resistance to a newly developed pesticide.

There are no homozygous resistant RR individuals.\n\nThe pesticide is then applied once across the entire region. The probability of any individual insect surviving the application is dependent on its genotype. For a susceptible rr insect, the survival probability is effectively zero. For any insect carrying the resistance allele R (in this case, the Rr individuals), the probability of survival is $c_R = 0.050$.

Historical records are incomplete, but local folklore suggests that a severe industrial chemical spill approximately 50 years ago may have caused a drastic, short-term reduction in the fish population. To test this hypothesis, the biologist sequences a specific neutral, non-coding gene locus from 150 individuals in the current population. For a historical comparison, they have managed to extract and sequence DNA from the same locus from a large collection of museum specimens of the same species, all collected from the same river 100 years prior to the present day (i.e., before the potential spill event).\n\nWhich of the following comparative findings between the modern and historical genetic data would provide the most direct and compelling evidence that the fish population experienced a severe bottleneck in its recent past?\n\nA. The modern population exhibits a significantly lower number of alleles at the studied locus compared to the historical population, with many alleles that were rare in the historical sample being entirely absent in the modern one.\n\nB. The average physical length of an adult fish in the modern population is 15% smaller than the average length recorded for the historical specimens.\n\nC. The mutation rate at the locus, calculated by comparing the sequences to a distantly related species, is found to be substantially higher in the modern population than in the historical one.\n\nD. The modern population has a different set of dominant alleles than the historical population, suggesting that natural selection has favored new traits for surviving in a post-spill environment.\n\nE. The modern population and the historical population have the exact same set of alleles, but their relative frequencies have changed, with one allele that was moderately common now being present in 98% of the modern individuals.", "solution": "We use principles of population genetics regarding bottlenecks at a neutral, non-coding locus. A demographic bottleneck is a severe, short-term reduction in effective population size, which increases the strength of genetic drift. For a neutral locus, the predicted genetic signatures of a recent, severe bottleneck include:\n- Loss of allelic richness (reduction in the number of alleles), with disproportionate loss of rare alleles due to sampling effects under drift.\n- Reduction in heterozygosity, although the loss of rare alleles is typically the most sensitive indicator in the short term.\nBecause the locus is neutral and non-coding, selection is not expected to act directly on it; thus, changes at this locus primarily reflect drift and demography rather than adaptation.\n\nEvaluate options against these predictions and potential confounders:\n- Option A: A significantly lower number of alleles in the modern sample, with historically rare alleles now absent, matches the core bottleneck signature at a neutral locus: loss of allelic richness and preferential loss of rare variants due to enhanced drift. This is direct and compelling evidence of a severe recent bottleneck.\n- Option B: A decrease in average body length is a phenotypic change that can be caused by environmental effects or selection; it is not a direct genetic signature of a bottleneck and does not focus on the neutral locus.\n- Option C: A change in mutation rate inferred by comparison to a distantly related species is not an expected outcome of a short-term bottleneck and is methodologically confounded; mutation rates are not altered by recent demographic events and should not differ over such a timescale at a neutral locus.\n- Option D: A shift in dominant alleles suggesting natural selection emphasizes adaptive processes, not demography; at a neutral locus, selection should not be the driver. Even if selection occurred elsewhere, this does not directly evidence a bottleneck.\n- Option E: The exact same set of alleles with large frequency shifts (e.g., one allele at 0.98) could arise from drift during a bottleneck, but the absence of allele loss weakens the inference. Such a pattern can also result from selection or other processes. In contrast, severe bottlenecks typically cause loss of rare alleles, which is not observed here.\n\nTherefore, the finding that most directly and compellingly indicates a severe recent bottleneck at a neutral locus is the loss of allelic richness, especially of rare alleles, as stated in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1973414"}]}
