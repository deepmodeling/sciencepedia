This founding group is a subset of a much larger mainland population. The genetic characteristic being monitored is scale coloration, which is determined by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele $A$ for green scales and a recessive allele $a$ for brown scales. The genotypes of the 10 lizards in the founding group are as follows: 2 individuals are homozygous dominant ($AA$), 5 are heterozygous ($Aa$), and 3 are homozygous recessive ($aa$).\n\nCalculate the initial frequencies of the $A$ and $a$ alleles in this new island population.

This sampling process can lead to significant, unpredictable shifts in allele frequencies, including the complete loss of alleles. This practice problem [@problem_id:1970293] models a common scenario in conservation biology, challenging you to calculate the probability of losing a rare allele when establishing a new colony, thereby highlighting the role of chance in shaping genetic diversity.", "problem": "In a conservation effort, biologists plan to establish a new colony of the rare Golden-Winged Finch on a remote, protected island. The source population is a large, captive-bred flock that is assumed to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a specific genetic locus. This locus controls beak coloration, with a dominant allele $B$ resulting in a standard yellow beak and a recessive allele $b$ resulting in a pale, almost white, beak. While not harmful, the pale beak phenotype is considered undesirable for the reintroduction program's aesthetic goals.\n\nIn the large source population, the frequency of the dominant allele $B$ is $p = 0.9$, and the frequency of the recessive allele $b$ is $q = 0.1$. To start the new colony, a team randomly selects two diploid individuals from this source flock.\n\nCalculate the probability that the recessive allele $b$ is completely absent in this founding pair. Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $p$ denote the frequency of the dominant allele $B$ and $q$ the frequency of the recessive allele $b$, with $p=0.9$ and $q=0.1$. In a large population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, genotype frequencies at this locus are $P(BB)=p^{2}$, $P(Bb)=2pq$, and $P(bb)=q^{2}$.\n\nThe recessive allele $b$ is completely absent in the founding pair if and only if both sampled individuals are homozygous dominant $BB$. Because the two individuals are sampled randomly and the source population is large, the genotype outcomes for the two individuals are independent with the Hardy-Weinberg frequencies.

This exercise [@problem_id:1970299] shifts our focus from autosomal alleles to uniparentally inherited markers: mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the Y-chromosome. By analyzing a classic human colonization scenario, you will explore how the number of founding males and females directly determines the initial diversity of these crucial genetic lineages, a principle fundamental to tracing ancestry and migration history.", "problem": "A remote, previously uninhabited island in the Pacific is colonized by a small group of shipwreck survivors. The founding group consists of 10 men and 4 women. Genetic analysis of historical records confirms that all 14 individuals in this founding group were unrelated to each other. This scenario is a classic example of the founder effect in population genetics.\n\nAssuming no new individuals arrive on the island, and ignoring the effects of mutation and genetic drift on lineage loss over time, what is the maximum possible number of distinct Y-chromosome lineages and distinct mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages that could be present in the descendant population?\n\nProvide your answer as a two-element row matrix, where the first element is the maximum number of Y-chromosome lineages and the second element is the maximum number of mitochondrial DNA lineages.", "solution": "We identify how uniparentally inherited markers propagate. The Y chromosome is transmitted strictly from father to son, so only male founders contribute distinct Y-chromosome lineages. Mitochondrial DNA is transmitted strictly from mother to all offspring, so only female founders contribute distinct mtDNA lineages.\n\nLet $n_{Y}$ be the number of distinct Y-chromosome lineages in the descendants and $n_{mt}$ be the number of distinct mtDNA lineages in the descendants. Because the 14 founders are mutually unrelated, each male founder represents a unique Y lineage and each female founder represents a unique mtDNA lineage at the start. The constraints “no new individuals,” “ignoring mutation,” and “ignoring genetic drift on lineage loss” together imply that no new lineages are added and none of the founding lineages are lost; hence the maximal possible numbers in the descendant population equal the number of corresponding-sex founders.\n\nTherefore,\n$$n_{Y}^{\\max} = 10,$$\n$$n_{mt}^{\\max} = 4.$$\n\nThe requested two-element row matrix is thus\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}10  4\\end{pmatrix}.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}10  4\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1970299"}]}
