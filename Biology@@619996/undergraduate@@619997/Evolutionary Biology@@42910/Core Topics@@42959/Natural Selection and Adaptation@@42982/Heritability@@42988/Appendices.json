A higher WUE value is desirable for cultivation in arid regions. To understand the potential for selective breeding, they conduct a series of experiments to partition the variance of this trait.\n\nIn a large, genetically diverse population grown under field conditions, the total phenotypic variance ($V_P$) for WUE is measured to be 84.0 units². To estimate the environmental component of the variance, they grow a genetically uniform F1 hybrid population (where all individuals are genetically identical) in the same field. The variance observed in this F1 population, which can be attributed solely to environmental factors ($V_E$), is 25.2 units². Further genetic analysis using controlled crosses allows them to estimate the variance component due to dominance effects ($V_D$) as 12.6 units².

Once the offspring mature, their mean thermal tolerance is measured using the same stress index and is found to be 5.80.\n\nAssuming the environmental conditions are constant across generations and that the observed change in the mean stress index is a direct result of the selection process, calculate the realized heritability of thermal tolerance in this coral population.

Realized heritability can be calculated using the breeder's equation, which relates the response to selection ($R$), the narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$), and the selection differential ($S$). The equation is:\n$$R = h^2 S$$\nTo find the realized heritability, we can rearrange this equation to $h^2 = \\frac{R}{S}$.

Resolving this apparent paradox will solidify your understanding that heritability measures the proportion of trait variance attributable to genetic *variation*, not the overall importance of genes in development.", "problem": "In the deep-sea hydrothermal vents, a species of bacterium, *Caldurivibrio profundus*, thrives in a remarkably stable high-temperature environment. Its survival is critically dependent on a specific enzyme, \"thermostabilase,\" which prevents the denaturation of its cellular proteins. The gene encoding thermostabilase is known as the `tbs` gene. Decades of genetic sequencing have revealed that the `tbs` gene is under intense purifying selection, and as a result, there is virtually no allelic variation for this gene across the entire global population of *C. profundus*; every individual possesses the same optimal allele.\n\nA team of evolutionary biologists conducted a study to measure the quantitative genetics of thermostabilase activity. Despite the fact that the enzyme's structure is fundamentally determined by the `tbs` gene, they found that the narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) for the trait of \"thermostabilase activity level\" was approximately zero.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best scientific explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The total phenotypic variance ($V_P$) for thermostabilase activity in the population is zero.\n\nB. The trait is exclusively determined by environmental factors, not genetic factors.\n\nC.

Because the enzyme activity is fundamentally determined by the $tbs$ gene and this gene shows essentially no allelic variation in the global population, the additive genetic variance for thermostabilase activity contributed by $tbs$ is essentially zero. If $tbs$ is the primary genetic determinant of the trait, then the total $V_{A}$ for the trait in the population is essentially zero.\n\nEnvironmental variation and other non-additive effects can still contribute to $V_{P}$, so $V_{P}$ need not be zero. Thus $h^{2}=V_{A}/V_{P}\\approx 0$ is best explained by $V_{A}\\approx 0$ rather than by $V_{P}=0$ or by measurement error.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because $V_{P}$ can be nonzero due to $V_{E}$ (and possibly $V_{I}$), even if $V_{A}=0$.\n- B is too strong; the genetic architecture determines the mean, but the lack of segregating additive variation, not exclusive environmental determination, explains near-zero $h^{2}$.\n- C is inconsistent with monomorphism at the key locus; moreover, near-zero $h^{2}$ specifically indicates small $V_{A}$, not necessarily large $V_{D}$.\n- D correctly states that there is essentially no additive genetic variance for the trait, which directly yields $h^{2}\\approx 0$.\n- E is an ad hoc methodological explanation not required by the data and unnecessary given the theory.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that $V_{A}\\approx 0$ for thermostabilase activity in this population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1946463"}]}
