A researcher proposes a mathematical model for the fitness landscape that governs the selection of these traits.

This problem connects the fitness of individual genotypes to the evolutionary outcome for the entire population. You will analyze a case of heterozygote advantage, where the fitness landscape for allele frequencies has a single peak, and calculate the stable equilibrium frequency of an allele. This practice is a cornerstone of population genetics, demonstrating how natural selection can actively maintain genetic variation. [@problem_id:1929441]", "problem": "In a large, randomly-mating population of a biennial plant, a single gene locus with two alleles, `R` and `S`, governs cold tolerance. The allele `R` is associated with resistance to frost, while `S` is associated with sensitivity. The relative fitness values of the three possible genotypes, measured as the average number of successful offspring that survive to reproduce, have been determined over many seasons. The fitness of the `RR` homozygote is $w_{RR} = 0.88$. The fitness of the `SS` homozygote is $w_{SS} = 0.72$. The fitness of the `RS` heterozygote is $w_{RS} = 1.0$.\n\nAssuming that only selection is acting on this allele and the population has reached a stable equilibrium, calculate the equilibrium frequency of the allele `R`. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $p$ be the frequency of the allele `R` and $q$ be the frequency of the allele `S`. Since there are only two alleles at this locus, their frequencies must sum to 1, so $p + q = 1$. The problem provides the relative fitness values for the three genotypes: $w_{RR} = 0.88$, $w_{RS} = 1.0$, and $w_{SS} = 0.72$. This scenario, where the heterozygote has the highest fitness, is known as overdominance or heterozygote advantage. Such a system leads to a stable polymorphic equilibrium, where both alleles are maintained in the population.\n\nTo find the equilibrium frequency, we can analyze the change in allele frequency from one generation to the next. The frequency of allele `R` in the next generation, denoted as $p'$, is the proportion of `R` alleles in the gene pool after selection has acted upon the current generation.\n\nAssuming the population is at Hardy-Weinberg proportions before selection, the frequencies of the genotypes `RR`, `RS`, and `SS` are $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$, respectively. After selection, the contribution of each genotype to the next generation's gene pool is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its fitness.\n\nThe total contribution to the gene pool is measured by the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, which is the weighted average of the genotype fitnesses:\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2 w_{RR} + 2pq w_{RS} + q^2 w_{SS} $$\n\nThe number of `R` alleles after selection is proportional to $p^2 w_{RR}$ (from `RR` individuals) plus $pq w_{RS}$ (from half of the alleles in `RS` individuals). Thus, the frequency of `R` in the next generation is:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^2 w_{RR} + pq w_{RS}}{\\bar{w}} $$\n\nAt equilibrium, the allele frequency does not change, meaning $p' = p$. The change in allele frequency, $\\Delta p = p' - p$, is zero. This leads to the equation:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{p^2 w_{RR} + pq w_{RS}}{p^2 w_{RR} + 2pq w_{RS} + q^2 w_{SS}} - p = 0 $$\n\nFor a non-trivial equilibrium (where $p \\neq 0$ and $p \\neq 1$), it is simpler to use the standard formula derived from setting $\\Delta p = 0$. The condition for equilibrium is met when the marginal fitnesses of the two alleles are equal. A more direct approach involves defining selection coefficients. Let's define the selection coefficients $s$ and $t$ against the homozygotes, relative to the most fit genotype (the heterozygote).\n\nThe selection coefficient against the `RR` genotype is $s$, where $w_{RR} = 1 - s$.\nThe selection coefficient against the `SS` genotype is $t$, where $w_{SS} = 1 - t$.\n(This simplified form assumes $w_{RS}=1$, which is the case here).\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n$s = 1 - w_{RR} = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12$\n$t = 1 - w_{SS} = 1 - 0.72 = 0.28$\n\nThe change in allele frequency $p$ can be expressed in terms of $s$ and $t$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{pq(-sp + tq)}{\\bar{w}} $$\n\nAt a stable equilibrium, $\\Delta p = 0$. Since we are looking for an equilibrium where both alleles exist ($p \\neq 0$ and $q \\neq 0$), the term in the parentheses must be zero.
