This first practice problem provides a classic scenario where a dominant allele confers a disadvantage. By calculating the change in allele frequency over a single generation, you will apply the core concepts of relative fitness, mean population fitness, and the fundamental equations that govern the response to selection. This exercise is crucial for building an intuitive and quantitative understanding of how natural selection operates.

Individuals with at least one $A$ allele (genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$) display a bright, conspicuous color pattern. Individuals with the homozygous recessive genotype ($aa$) display a cryptic, camouflaged pattern.\n\nDue to differential predation, the conspicuous fish have a lower survival rate. Specifically, their probability of surviving from zygote to reproductive age is 20% lower than that of the camouflaged fish.\n\nAssume the population mates randomly, has non-overlapping generations, and that natural selection is the only evolutionary force acting on this locus. If the initial frequency of the dominant allele $A$ in the population's gene pool is 0.5, what will be the frequency of the recessive allele $a$ in the gene pool of the next generation?\n\nProvide your answer as a number rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let $p$ be the frequency of the dominant allele $A$ and $q$ be the frequency of the recessive allele $a$. The problem gives the initial frequency of allele $A$ as $p_0 = 0.5$. Since there are only two alleles at this locus, the initial frequency of allele $a$ is $q_0 = 1 - p_0 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n\nThe problem describes selection based on phenotype. The conspicuous phenotype (genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$) has a survival rate that is 20% lower than the camouflaged phenotype (genotype $aa$). We can quantify this by assigning relative fitness values ($w$) to each genotype. Let's set the fitness of the most successful genotype, the camouflaged $aa$, to 1.\n$w_{aa} = 1.0$\n\nThe fitness of the conspicuous genotypes ($AA$ and $Aa$) is 20% lower, which means their fitness is $1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n$w_{AA} = 0.80$\n$w_{Aa} = 0.80$\n\nAssuming the population is initially in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of the three genotypes in the zygotes are:\nFrequency of $AA$ $= p_0^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\nFrequency of $Aa$ $= 2p_0q_0 = 2(0.5)(0.5) = 0.50$\nFrequency of $aa$ $= q_0^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n\nAfter selection acts, the contribution of each genotype to the next generation's gene pool is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its relative fitness. To find the new allele frequencies, we must first calculate the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$.\n$\\bar{w} = (\\text{freq}(AA) \\times w_{AA}) + (\\text{freq}(Aa) \\times w_{Aa}) + (\\text{freq}(aa) \\times w_{aa})$\n$\\bar{w} = (p_0^2 \\times w_{AA}) + (2p_0q_0 \\times w_{Aa}) + (q_0^2 \\times w_{aa})$\nSubstituting the values:\n$\\bar{w} = (0.25 \\times 0.80) + (0.50 \\times 0.80) + (0.25 \\times 1.0)$\n$\\bar{w} = 0.20 + 0.40 + 0.25 = 0.85$\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency of the recessive allele $a$ in the next generation, denoted as $q_1$.
