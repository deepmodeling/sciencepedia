The most direct way to do this is by calculating an individual's or a genotype's absolute fitness, which is its expected contribution to the next generation. This foundational exercise [@problem_id:1917453] guides you through a classic life-history trade-off by asking you to compare two reproductive strategies and determine which yields a greater number of surviving offspring.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the life history of a rare species of annual plant, *Silene novellus*. This plant species exhibits a fixed energy budget for reproduction and displays a genetic polymorphism that results in two distinct reproductive strategies.\n\nThe first strategy, termed the \"high-yield\" strategy, involves the production of a large number of small, lightweight seeds. Individuals with this genotype produce, on average, 150 seeds per plant. These seeds have a low provisioning of nutrients, and extensive field studies have shown their probability of surviving to germination and establishment of a new seedling is 4%.\n\nThe second strategy, termed the \"high-investment\" strategy, involves producing a smaller number of large, nutrient-rich seeds. Individuals with this genotype produce, on average, 25 seeds per plant. Due to the significant nutrient stores, these seeds have a much higher probability of survival, measured at 28%.\n\nAssuming that these survival probabilities are constant and that all other factors are equal, determine which reproductive strategy results in a higher absolute fitness, defined here as the total number of surviving offspring produced by an average individual.\n\nA. The \"high-yield\" strategy is superior.\n\nB. The \"high-investment\" strategy is superior.\n\nC. Both strategies result in equal absolute fitness.\n\nD. The relative fitness cannot be determined without information on the population size.", "solution": "Absolute fitness, defined as the expected number of surviving offspring per individual, is given by the expected value of a binomial process: if each seed survives independently with probability $p$ and $N$ seeds are produced, then the expected number of survivors is $E = Np$.\n\nFor the high-yield strategy:\nThe number of seeds is $N_{y} = 150$ and the survival probability is $p_{y} = 0.04 = \\frac{4}{100} = \\frac{1}{25}$. Therefore,\n$$\nE_{y} = N_{y} p_{y} = 150 \\cdot \\frac{1}{25} = 6.\n$$\n\nFor the high-investment strategy:\nThe number of seeds is $N_{i} = 25$ and the survival probability is $p_{i} = 0.28 = \\frac{28}{100} = \\frac{7}{25}$. Therefore,\n$$\nE_{i} = N_{i} p_{i} = 25 \\cdot \\frac{7}{25} = 7.\n$$\n\nSince $E_{i} = 7 > E_{y} = 6$, the high-investment strategy yields higher absolute fitness under the given assumptions.

This concept is captured by the metric of Lifetime Reproductive Success ($LRS$), which accounts for both survival and reproduction across different age classes. This practice [@problem_id:1917447] challenges you to calculate and compare the $LRS$ for two contrasting life-history strategies—semelparity (one-time reproduction) and iteroparity (repeated reproduction)—to see how different ways of allocating reproductive effort can be evolutionarily viable.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the life history strategies of two marine cephalopods: a species of octopus that exhibits semelparity (a single reproductive event followed by death) and a species of nautilus that exhibits iteroparity (multiple reproductive events over its lifetime). The biologist has collected demographic data for females of both species.\n\nFor the semelparous octopus:\n- The maximum lifespan is 2 years. Individuals reproduce only at the end of their second year of life.\n- The probability of a newly hatched female octopus surviving to her first birthday is $p_{O,1} = 0.10$.\n- The probability of a one-year-old female surviving to her second birthday is $p_{O,2} = 0.80$.\n- A female that survives to age 2 produces, on average, $M_O = 300$ female offspring before dying.\n\nFor the iteroparous nautilus:\n- The maximum lifespan is 4 years. Individuals begin reproducing at age 2 and continue to reproduce annually until they die after their fourth year.\n- The annual survival probability for a female nautilus of any age is constant, $p_N = 0.90$.\n- A female nautilus that is age 2 or older produces, on average, $M_N = 15$ female offspring each year.\n\nAssuming these demographic rates are constant, calculate the ratio of the nautilus's lifetime reproductive success to the octopus's lifetime reproductive success.
