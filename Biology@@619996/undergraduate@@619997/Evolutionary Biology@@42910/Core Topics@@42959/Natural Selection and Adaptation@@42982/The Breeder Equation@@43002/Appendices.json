This first exercise walks you through a complete, step-by-step prediction of evolutionary change. By starting with the fundamental concepts of additive genetic variance ($V_A$) and phenotypic variance ($V_P$), you will calculate narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) and use it to forecast the response to a specific selection pressure, much like predicting the outcome of natural selection in a wild population [@problem_id:1968816].", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is studying a population of island lizards, focusing on the quantitative trait of tail length.
