The intensity of this color is quantified by a metric called Pigmentation Units (PU). In a particular meadow, the mean pigmentation for the entire population is 45.0 PU. A new species of bee, which is the sole pollinator in this isolated environment, has a strong preference for flowers with more intense coloration. Consequently, only the plants with higher pigmentation levels are successfully pollinated and reproduce. The mean pigmentation of these successfully reproducing parent plants is measured to be 57.0 PU. Genetic studies on *A. luminosa* have determined that the narrow-sense heritability of petal pigmentation is 0.65.\n\nAssuming this selective pressure remains constant for one generation, calculate the predicted mean petal pigmentation of the offspring generation.

The trait of interest is the flowering time, measured as the number of days after the vernal equinox. In a large population studied during a particular year (Generation 0), the mean flowering time for all individuals was 75.0 days. However, due to an unusually rapid snowmelt and subsequent summer drought, only plants that flowered earlier in the season were able to successfully reproduce. The mean flowering time of these successfully reproducing individuals was found to be 68.0 days.\n\nA quantitative genetic analysis was performed on this population to understand the inheritance of this trait. The study determined the following components of phenotypic variance for flowering time: the additive genetic variance ($V_A$) was 12.0 days$^2$, the dominance genetic variance ($V_D$) was 8.0 days$^2$, and the environmental variance ($V_E$) was 10.0 days$^2$.

The plants are found to be uniformly distributed along this gradient, which ranges from a SWA value of $W_{min} = 10$ hydro-units to $W_{max} = 50$ hydro-units.\n\nIn response to water availability, the plants exhibit phenotypic plasticity in their root-to-shoot mass ratio, a dimensionless quantity denoted by $R$. For any given genotype, this plastic response is linear and can be described by a reaction norm equation: $R(W) = a + bW$, where $W$ is the SWA. The parameter $a$ represents the baseline root-to-shoot ratio, and $b$ is the slope of the reaction norm, which quantifies the sensitivity of the trait to changes in SWA.\n\nThe optimal root-to-shoot ratio for maximizing fitness, denoted $\\theta(W)$, also varies linearly with SWA: $\\theta(W) = \\alpha + \\beta W$.
