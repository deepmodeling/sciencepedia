To quantify it, we must often consider multiple life-history traits at once. This first exercise [@problem_id:1918140] provides a foundational case study in calculating fitness by combining two of its most critical components: viability (survival to reproductive age) and fecundity (the number of offspring produced). Critically, it introduces the concept of an evolutionary trade-off, where an advantage in one trait, like pesticide resistance, may be counterbalanced by a disadvantage in another, such as reduced fertility.", "problem": "In a population of the Veridian Vine Borer moth, a major agricultural pest, two common homozygous genotypes exist at a single locus influencing pesticide tolerance: a susceptible genotype (SS) and a resistant genotype (RR). To control an infestation, a new pesticide is applied to a vineyard. A field study is conducted to measure the components of fitness for each genotype in this new environment. The study finds that for every 100 larvae of the susceptible (SS) genotype, only 20 survive to adulthood. In contrast, for every 100 larvae of the resistant (RR) genotype, 75 survive to adulthood. Surviving adult females of the susceptible genotype lay an average of 250 eggs, while surviving adult females of the resistant genotype lay an average of 160 eggs due to a metabolic cost associated with resistance.\n\nCalculate the relative fitness of the susceptible genotype (SS), using the resistant genotype (RR) as the reference standard.

Specifically, the mutant strain appears to have a significantly higher reproductive output early in life, but this comes at the cost of accelerated senescence, leading to lower survivorship and fecundity in later life stages compared to the wild-type strain.\n\nTo quantify the evolutionary success of this mutation, the biologist has collected the following life table data for both the wild-type (WT) and mutant (MT) strains under controlled laboratory conditions.

This can lead to fascinating conflicts where an allele's \"interest\" diverges from the organism's.

You will learn to calculate an \"effective fitness\" for a genotype that accounts for this non-standard segregation, offering a glimpse into the complex world of intragenomic conflict.", "problem": "In the study of evolutionary dynamics, \"selfish\" genetic elements present a fascinating challenge to simple models of selection. These are alleles that enhance their own transmission to the next generation, sometimes at a cost to the organism's overall reproductive success.\n\nConsider a hypothetical diploid insect species, *Artificia selecta*, where a single gene locus has two alleles: a wild-type allele, $A$, and a selfish \"segregation distorter\" allele, $a$. The selfish allele exhibits meiotic drive in heterozygotes. All genotypes are assumed to have equal viability from zygote to adult. However, the genotypes differ in their reproductive output (fecundity) and gamete transmission probabilities.\n\nThe relevant biological data are as follows:\n- The average fecundity (number of viable offspring produced) for females of each genotype is:\n    - $AA$ (wild-type homozygote): $N_{AA} = 120$ offspring\n    - $Aa$ (heterozygote): $N_{Aa} = 120$ offspring\n    - $aa$ (selfish homozygote): $N_{aa} = 48$ offspring\n- In $Aa$ heterozygotes, meiotic drive occurs. The fraction of functional gametes that carry the selfish allele $a$ is $k=0.8$. Consequently, the fraction of gametes carrying the wild-type allele $A$ is $1-k=0.2$. In homozygotes ($AA$ and $aa$), segregation is Mendelian (i.e., all gametes carry the respective allele).\n\nIn population genetics, the combined effects of fecundity and meiotic drive can be modeled by assigning an \"effective\" relative fitness to the heterozygote. This value represents the fitness it would need in a standard Mendelian system to have the same evolutionary impact.\n\nCalculate the effective relative fitness of the heterozygote ($w_{Aa}$) and the relative fitness of the selfish homozygote ($w_{aa}$).
