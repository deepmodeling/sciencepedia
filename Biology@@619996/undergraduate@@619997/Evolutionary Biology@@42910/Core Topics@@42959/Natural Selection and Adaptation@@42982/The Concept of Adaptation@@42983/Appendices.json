{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A central task in evolutionary biology is to move beyond observing a trait and into rigorously testing its adaptive function. This first practice challenges you to interpret the results of a classic field experiment designed to determine if conspicuous coloration in caterpillars serves as a warning to predators. By comparing predation rates on realistic models that differ only in color, you will learn how to isolate a single variable to test an evolutionary hypothesis and draw conclusions directly from the data [@problem_id:1969502].", "problem": "An evolutionary biology student is investigating whether the conspicuous coloration of the monarch caterpillar (*Danaus plexippus*) is an adaptation to reduce predation from birds. Monarch caterpillars feed on milkweed plants and sequester toxic cardenolide compounds, making them unpalatable. The student hypothesizes that their bright yellow, black, and white bands serve as a warning signal (aposematism) to predators who have learned to associate the pattern with a bad taste.\n\nTo test this, the student conducts a field experiment. They create 1000 soft clay models of caterpillars, all of which are non-toxic.\n- 500 models are painted with a cryptic (camouflaged) pattern, matching the dull green and brown colors of a common, non-toxic caterpillar species found in the same habitat. This is the **Control Group**.\n- 500 models are painted to precisely mimic the bright yellow, black, and white bands of a monarch caterpillar. This is the **Experimental Group**.\n\nAll 1000 models are then randomly placed on milkweed plants in a natural area known to be frequented by both monarch caterpillars and various insectivorous birds. After 48 hours, the student collects the models and records the number in each group that show clear beak marks, indicating an attack by a bird.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n- **Control Group (Cryptic)**: 125 of the 500 models were attacked.\n- **Experimental Group (Conspicuous)**: 30 of the 500 models were attacked.\n\nBased on the data from this experiment, which of the following statements represents the most direct and well-supported conclusion?\n\nA. The conspicuous coloration pattern used in the experiment confers a selective advantage in this environment by reducing the likelihood of an attack by avian predators.\n\nB. The experiment demonstrates that the chemical defenses of real monarch caterpillars are effective at deterring birds.\n\nC. Avian predators in this habitat have an innate, unlearned preference for consuming cryptically colored caterpillars.\n\nD. The experiment conclusively proves that the bright coloration of monarch caterpillars is an aposematic adaptation.\n\nE. The results are inconclusive because the clay models lack the natural movements and chemical cues of real caterpillars.", "solution": "The goal of this problem is to correctly interpret the results of a specific scientific experiment within the context of evolutionary principles. The experiment is designed to isolate one variable—color pattern—and test its effect on predation risk.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the quantitative data from the experiment.\n- The attack rate on the control group (cryptic models) is $\\frac{125}{500} = 0.25$, or 25%.\n- The attack rate on the experimental group (conspicuous models) is $\\frac{30}{500} = 0.06$, or 6%.\n\nThe data clearly shows that the conspicuously colored models were attacked far less frequently than the camouflaged, cryptic models. The core of the question is to determine which of the given options is the most accurate conclusion drawn *solely* from this observation.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. The conspicuous coloration pattern used in the experiment confers a selective advantage in this environment by reducing the likelihood of an attack by avian predators.**\nThis statement is a direct interpretation of the experimental results. A lower likelihood of attack means a higher probability of survival. In natural selection, any heritable trait that increases an organism's survival and subsequent reproduction confers a selective advantage. The experiment showed that the conspicuous color pattern, by itself, reduced attacks from 25% to 6%. This directly supports the conclusion that the coloration provides a selective advantage by reducing predation. This is the most accurate and well-supported conclusion.\n\n**B. The experiment demonstrates that the chemical defenses of real monarch caterpillars are effective at deterring birds.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The experiment used non-toxic clay models for both groups. Therefore, the experiment provides no data whatsoever on the effectiveness of the chemical defenses of real caterpillars. It was designed specifically to test the hypothesis that the *signal* (color) is effective, independent of the *consequence* (toxicity).\n\n**C. Avian predators in this habitat have an innate, unlearned preference for consuming cryptically colored caterpillars.**\nThis statement makes an unsupported assumption. The data shows that birds attacked cryptic models more often, but it does not explain *why*. The lower attack rate on conspicuous models is more likely due to a learned avoidance of the warning signal from previous negative encounters with real, toxic monarch caterpillars, or possibly an innate aversion to such signals. The experiment cannot distinguish between learned behavior and innate behavior. Furthermore, framing it as a \"preference for\" the cryptic models is misleading; it's more likely an \"avoidance of\" the conspicuous models.\n\n**D. The experiment conclusively proves that the bright coloration of monarch caterpillars is an aposematic adaptation.**\nThis statement is too strong. Scientific conclusions are based on an accumulation of evidence, and a single experiment rarely \"conclusively proves\" a broad evolutionary concept. While the results strongly *support* the hypothesis, they don't constitute definitive proof. Moreover, aposematism is a complete system involving both the warning signal (color) and the unprofitability to the predator (e.g., toxicity). This experiment only tested the effectiveness of the signal in reducing attacks, not the entire aposematic system.\n\n**E. The results are inconclusive because the clay models lack the natural movements and chemical cues of real caterpillars.**\nThis statement misunderstands the purpose of an experimental control. While it is true that clay models are an imperfect mimic of real caterpillars, their use is a key strength of the experimental design. By using models that are identical in every way except for the color pattern, the experiment successfully isolates the effect of coloration. The significant difference in attack rates provides a very clear and conclusive result *regarding the role of the color pattern*. Criticizing the model's limitations doesn't render the specific conclusion about color invalid.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and directly supported conclusion is that the conspicuous coloration provides a selective advantage by reducing predation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1969502"}, {"introduction": "For a trait to evolve by natural selection, it must have a genetic basis. This practice explores the classic \"common garden\" experiment, a powerful method for disentangling the effects of genes (\"nature\") from the environment (\"nurture\"). By analyzing behavioral data from lizards raised in a controlled lab setting, you will practice determining whether differences observed in the wild are due to heritable adaptations or simply environmental influences [@problem_id:1969507].", "problem": "A behavioral ecologist is studying two geographically isolated populations of the fictional lizard species, *Anolis spectabilis*.\n\nPopulation A lives on a small, arid island where population density is high and key resources like food and shelter are scarce. Field observations show that these lizards are highly aggressive, with a mean aggression score of 18.5 units, based on standardized mirror-image stimulation tests.\n\nPopulation B inhabits a large, resource-abundant mainland forest where population density is low. These lizards are observed to be much more docile, with a mean aggression score of 5.2 units in the same tests.\n\nThe ecologist hypothesizes that the higher aggression in Population A is a genetic adaptation to the intense competition in their environment. To test this, she conducts a common garden experiment. She collects eggs from the nests of multiple females in both populations and incubates them in a controlled laboratory setting. All hatchlings are then raised to maturity under identical conditions of housing, diet, and social environment. Once mature, the aggression levels of these lab-raised lizards are measured using the same standardized test.\n\nThe results for the lab-raised lizards are as follows:\n- Lizards from Population A parents: Mean aggression score = 17.9 units.\n- Lizards from Population B parents: Mean aggression score = 6.1 units.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following is the most valid conclusion?\n\nA. The persistence of the aggression difference in a common environment strongly suggests that the trait has a significant genetic basis, supporting the hypothesis that it is a local adaptation.\n\nB. The results indicate that the difference in aggression is an example of phenotypic plasticity, where the environment directly determines the behavioral outcome.\n\nC. The experiment is inconclusive because it does not control for potential maternal effects, such as a mother's nutritional state influencing the hormones deposited in the egg yolk.\n\nD. The lab environment itself must have induced the aggression, as the scores are not identical to the wild populations.\n\nE. The similarity between the common garden and wild scores for each population shows there is no genetic basis for aggression, and the differences are likely due to random chance.", "solution": "Let the observed aggression phenotype be decomposed as $P=G+E+M+\\epsilon$, where $G$ denotes additive genetic effects attributable to population ancestry, $E$ denotes environmental effects attributable to the rearing environment, $M$ denotes maternal effects (for example, yolk hormones, nutrient provisioning, or other non-genetic maternal contributions), and $\\epsilon$ is residual variation. In wild populations, $P$ differs between Population A and Population B, but because both $G$ and $E$ differ between sites, and $M$ may covary with environment, one cannot attribute the difference to any single component.\n\nIn a common garden experiment, hatchlings from both populations are reared under identical conditions, so $E$ is held constant across populations. If $\\Delta P$ persists between lineages in the common garden, then the difference cannot be explained by $E$ and must arise from $G$ and/or $M$, that is,\n$$\n\\Delta P_{\\text{CG}}=\\Delta G+\\Delta M+\\Delta \\epsilon,\n$$\nwith $\\Delta E=0$ by design. The reported results show that lab-raised lizards from Population A parents have a high mean aggression score (approximately $17.9$ units) and those from Population B parents have a low mean aggression score (approximately $6.1$ units), closely mirroring wild differences. Therefore, the persistence of a large $\\Delta P_{\\text{CG}}$ under equal $E$ provides strong evidence that $G$ differs between populations. This is the classical inference from common garden designs: when environmental variation is controlled and population differences remain, a genetic basis is implicated.\n\nWhile $M$ can contribute to $\\Delta P_{\\text{CG}}$ because eggs were collected from different mothers (and thus maternal yolk effects could differ), this possibility qualifies the strength of the inference but does not render the experiment inconclusive. To isolate $G$ from $M$ entirely, one would rear offspring for at least one additional lab generation or use designs that equalize maternal provisioning (for example, controlled crosses). Nevertheless, given the large and stable divergence in the controlled environment, the most valid conclusion among the offered choices is that the trait has a significant genetic basis consistent with local adaptation to the high-competition environment of Population A.\n\nOption-by-option evaluation:\n- A: Correct. Persistence of differences in a common environment strongly suggests a genetic basis and is consistent with local adaptation.\n- B: Incorrect. Phenotypic plasticity would predict convergence when $E$ is held constant; the opposite is observed.\n- C: Overstates the limitation. Maternal effects are a caveat but do not make the study inconclusive; the evidence still strongly suggests genetic differentiation.\n- D: Incorrect. The lab environment is identical for both groups; it cannot account for the between-population difference.\n- E: Incorrect. The close correspondence between wild and common garden means argues against random chance and supports a genetic contribution.\n\nThus, the most valid conclusion is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1969507"}, {"introduction": "Natural selection often favors traits that seem paradoxical at first glance, such as selfless acts that put an individual at risk. This final practice delves into the theory of kin selection by asking you to quantify the evolutionary payoff of an alarm call in a prairie dog society. You will apply the concept of inclusive fitness to calculate whether the genetic benefit passed through relatives outweighs the direct cost to the individual, providing a mathematical basis for the evolution of altruism [@problem_id:1969488].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the social behavior of a population of black-tailed prairie dogs. These animals live in family groups called coteries and often give alarm calls to warn relatives of approaching predators. This act of calling, however, can draw the predator's attention to the caller. The biologist aims to quantify the net genetic advantage or disadvantage of this behavior for a typical individual.\n\nConsider a focal individual that has just spotted a predator. The coterie consists of this focal individual and nine other members. The average coefficient of relatedness between the focal individual and any other single member of its coterie is given as $r = 0.30$.\n\nIn this model, an individual's direct fitness is directly proportional to its probability of surviving the predator encounter. The biologist has established the following probabilities based on extensive field observations:\n\n1.  If no alarm call is given, the predator is moderately successful, and the probability of survival for any individual in the coterie is 0.75.\n2.  If the focal individual gives an alarm call, its own probability of survival is reduced to 0.60 due to its increased conspicuousness. However, the warning allows the other nine members to take cover, increasing each of their survival probabilities to 0.95.\n\nAn individual's inclusive fitness is defined as the sum of its own fitness (direct fitness) and the fitness of its relatives (indirect fitness), with each relative's fitness devalued by the coefficient of relatedness. Kin selection will favor the alarm-calling trait if the change in the caller's inclusive fitness, compared to the scenario where no call is given, is positive.\n\nCalculate this net change in the focal individual's inclusive fitness that results from the decision to give the alarm call. Express your answer as a dimensionless numerical value, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "Let $s_{\\text{self}}$ be the focal individual's survival probability and $s_{i}$ be the survival probability of each of the $n=9$ other coterie members.
