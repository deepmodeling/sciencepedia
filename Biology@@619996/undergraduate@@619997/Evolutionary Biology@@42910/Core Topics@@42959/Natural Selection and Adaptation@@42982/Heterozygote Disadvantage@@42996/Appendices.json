This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to calculate key parameters like relative fitness ($w$) and the selection coefficient ($s$) directly from census data of a hypothetical moth population. Mastering this skill is fundamental to translating field observations into a quantitative model of evolution.", "problem": "A population geneticist is studying a species of moth where a single gene with two alleles, $A_1$ and $A_2$, controls the primary wing color. This coloration is crucial for camouflage against specific predators. The two homozygous genotypes, $A_1A_1$ and $A_2A_2$, result in phenotypes that are well-camouflaged in the local environment, but the heterozygous genotype, $A_1A_2$, produces an intermediate coloration that stands out, leading to higher predation. This phenomenon is a classic example of heterozygote disadvantage, or underdominance.\n\nTo quantify the strength of selection, the researcher tags a cohort of 800 newly emerged moths. Genotyping reveals the initial counts to be 300 individuals of genotype $A_1A_1$, 200 of genotype $A_1A_2$, and 300 of genotype $A_2A_2$. After one predation season, the surviving moths are recaptured and counted. The census finds 282 survivors of genotype $A_1A_1$, 156 of genotype $A_1A_2$, and 288 of genotype $A_2A_2$.\n\nCalculate the selection coefficient, $s$, for the heterozygous genotype ($A_1A_2$). The selection coefficient is a measure of the intensity of selection against a given genotype and is related to relative fitness, $w$, by the equation $s = 1 - w$. Assume the genotype with the highest survival rate has a relative fitness of 1.0.

The observed initial counts are $N_{0}(A_{1}A_{1})=300$, $N_{0}(A_{1}A_{2})=200$, and $N_{0}(A_{2}A_{2})=300$. The corresponding survivor counts are $N_{s}(A_{1}A_{1})=282$, $N_{s}(A_{1}A_{2})=156$, and $N_{s}(A_{2}A_{2})=288$.

This practice focuses on calculating this critical frequency using known relative fitness values. This calculation is essential for predicting whether an allele will be driven to fixation or eliminated from the population.", "problem": "In a particular species of butterfly, wing coloration is controlled by a single gene with two alleles, $A_1$ and $A_2$. The population mates randomly. A long-term field study in a stable environment has determined the relative fitness values for the three possible genotypes.

This scenario, where the heterozygote has lower fitness than both homozygotes, is known as underdominance or heterozygote disadvantage. Such a system possesses an unstable internal equilibrium, which acts as a tipping point for the allele frequencies. The ultimate fate of an allele—either fixation or complete loss from the population—depends on whether its initial frequency is above or below this critical threshold.\n\nCalculate the minimum initial frequency of allele $A_1$ that is required for it to eventually become fixed in the population, assuming no other evolutionary forces (like mutation, migration, or genetic drift) are at play.
