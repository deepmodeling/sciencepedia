This practice illustrates a classic method for estimating broad-sense heritability ($H^2$), which represents the proportion of total phenotypic variance attributable to all sources of genetic variation [@problem_id:1957738]. By comparing the variance in a genetically diverse population to that in a genetically uniform line, we can isolate the environmental component and thereby quantify the overall importance of genetics for the trait.", "problem": "Aquaculturists are conducting a selection program to enhance the vibrant coloration of the Celestial Pearl Danio, a popular ornamental fish. They measure a quantitative trait called the 'iridescence score', which ranges from 0 (no iridescence) to 100 (maximum iridescence). In a large, genetically diverse, randomly mating population raised in a standard pond environment, the total phenotypic variance ($V_P$) for the iridescence score is measured to be 4.50. To isolate the effect of the environment, the researchers also measure the variance of the same trait within a highly inbred, genetically uniform line of these fish, raised under the exact same pond conditions. This variance is found to be 1.62.\n\nUsing this data, calculate the broad-sense heritability ($H^2$) for the iridescence score in this fish population.

This next exercise introduces narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$), which specifically isolates the additive genetic varianceâ€”the component that causes offspring to resemble their parents and thus fuels the response to selection [@problem_id:1957703].
