{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Testing an adaptive hypothesis often requires a manipulative experiment to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between a trait and a fitness benefit. This exercise explores a fantastic, real-world example of a parasitic fungus that alters its host's behavior. By evaluating several potential experimental designs, you will practice identifying the key components of a rigorous test: a proper control group, isolation of the variable of interest, and a relevant measure of fitness [@problem_id:1968194].", "problem": "In tropical forests, certain species of carpenter ants are susceptible to infection by the parasitic fungus *Ophiocordyceps unilateralis*. Once infected, an ant's behavior is dramatically altered. In its final hours, the fungus manipulates the ant to leave its colony, climb the stem of a plant to a specific height, and clamp its mandibles onto the underside of a leaf in a \"death grip.\" Shortly after, a fungal stalk erupts from the ant's head and releases spores onto the forest floor below.\n\nA biologist proposes the hypothesis that this manipulated climbing behavior is an adaptation for the fungus, serving to maximize the dispersal of its spores to infect new hosts. You are tasked with evaluating several potential experimental designs to test this specific hypothesis.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs provides the most direct and rigorous test of the hypothesis that the climbing behavior itself is adaptive for the fungus?\n\nA. Locate a large number of infected ants that have already performed the climbing behavior and died. Measure the area over which spores are distributed beneath them. Compare this to the area around a group of uninfected dead ants placed on the forest floor.\n\nB. In a controlled laboratory setting, compare the total number of spores produced by fungal stalks growing from infected ants kept in a high-humidity terrarium versus those in a low-humidity terrarium.\n\nC. Locate a group of ants exhibiting the early signs of fungal manipulation (e.g., erratic movement) but before they have started climbing. Randomly assign them to two groups: Group 1 ants are allowed to climb vegetation as normal. Group 2 ants are prevented from climbing by being confined to a small enclosure on the forest floor. After the fungi sporulate, compare the number of new infections that appear in the vicinity of each group.\n\nD. Locate naturally occurring infected ants that have died at various heights on plant stems. For each ant, measure the height of its position and the density of spores that landed on the ground directly beneath it. Test for a correlation between height and spore density.\n\nE. Compare the average lifespan of infected ants that successfully perform the climbing behavior to the average lifespan of infected ants that die on the forest floor without climbing.", "solution": "To evaluate the proposed experimental designs, we must identify the one that best isolates the variable of interest—the climbing behavior—and measures the appropriate fitness outcome for the parasite—successful spore dispersal and subsequent infection. The hypothesis is that climbing *itself* confers a fitness advantage to the fungus compared to not climbing.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nOption A compares spore dispersal from infected ants to uninfected ants. This is a flawed design because uninfected ants do not have the fungus and therefore produce no spores. The control group is invalid as it does not provide a meaningful comparison. The experiment would trivially show that infected ants disperse spores and uninfected ones do not, which does not test the adaptive value of the *climbing behavior*.\n\nOption B tests the effect of humidity on spore production in a lab setting. While environmental factors like humidity are important for fungal growth, this experiment does not address the central hypothesis about the adaptive significance of the climbing behavior. It fails to test the effect of the ant's position (high on a plant vs. on the ground) on spore dispersal in a natural, ecologically relevant context.\n\nOption C provides the most rigorous test. It correctly identifies the key comparison: infected ants that climb versus infected ants that do not. By taking a sample of manipulated ants *before* the behavior is complete and randomly assigning them to \"climb\" (control) and \"no-climb\" (experimental) groups, the design directly isolates the effect of climbing. Crucially, it measures the correct fitness proxy for the fungus: the number of new infections. This directly quantifies the reproductive success resulting from the behavior. The use of enclosures for the \"no-climb\" group ensures that the comparison is localized and controlled. This is a classic manipulative experiment that establishes a causal link between the behavior and fitness.\n\nOption D describes a correlational study, not a manipulative experiment. While finding a positive correlation between height and spore density could be consistent with the hypothesis, correlation does not equal causation. There could be other confounding factors; for example, perhaps ants that are able to climb higher are healthier and thus support a more robust fungal growth, leading to more spores. This design is less powerful than a manipulative experiment like C, which actively controls the behavioral variable. It does not include a \"no-climb\" control group, which is essential for testing if climbing is better than not climbing at all.\n\nOption E measures the lifespan of the ant host. The hypothesis is not about the survival of the ant, but about the reproductive success (spore dispersal) of the fungus. At this stage of the infection, the ant is merely a vehicle for the parasite's reproduction. The ant's lifespan is therefore an irrelevant metric for testing the fitness benefits of the fungus's manipulative strategy. The fitness of the parasite is measured by how many new hosts it infects.\n\nTherefore, option C is the superior experimental design because it directly manipulates the behavior in question (climbing) and measures the direct consequence on the parasite's reproductive fitness (new infections).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1968194"}, {"introduction": "A powerful method for testing local adaptation is the reciprocal transplant experiment, where populations from different environments are grown in their 'home' and 'away' locations. This practice asks you to interpret the results of such an experiment, moving beyond simple 'better or worse' comparisons. Your goal is to use the fitness data to disentangle the effects of genetic predisposition and environmental pressures, and to identify the signature of a genotype-by-environment interaction [@problem_id:1968242].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is investigating whether two populations of a common plant, the narrowleaf plantain (*Plantago lanceolata*), have evolved specific adaptations to their local soil conditions. One population (the \"Roadside Population\") is from a habitat adjacent to a major highway that is heavily salted for de-icing during winter, resulting in high soil salinity. The second population (the \"Meadow Population\") is from a pristine inland meadow with very low soil salinity, located 50 kilometers away.\n\nTo test for genetically-based local adaptation, the biologist conducts a reciprocal transplant experiment. They collect seeds from numerous plants in both populations. These seeds are then germinated and grown in a controlled greenhouse environment to the seedling stage. Seedlings from both the Roadside and Meadow source populations are then transplanted into experimental plots at both the original Roadside site and the original Meadow site. After one full growing season, the biologist measures the fitness of each plant by counting the total number of viable seeds it produced. The average results are summarized below:\n\n*   Meadow Population seedlings planted at the Meadow site produced an average of 150 seeds per plant.\n*   Meadow Population seedlings planted at the Roadside site produced an average of 20 seeds per plant.\n*   Roadside Population seedlings planted at the Meadow site produced an average of 110 seeds per plant.\n*   Roadside Population seedlings planted at the Roadside site produced an average of 80 seeds per plant.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following conclusions are supported by the data? Select all that apply.\n\nA. The Meadow population is locally adapted to its native environment.\n\nB. The Roadside population is locally adapted to its native environment.\n\nC. The observed differences in seed production are due entirely to phenotypic plasticity, with no underlying genetic differences between the populations.\n\nD. There is evidence of a genotype-by-environment interaction affecting seed production.\n\nE. The Roadside population possesses a \"general-purpose\" genotype that has higher fitness than the Meadow population in all environments.", "solution": "Define the two genotypes by source population: $M$ for Meadow and $R$ for Roadside. Define the two environments (sites): $E_{Me}$ for Meadow and $E_{Ro}$ for Roadside. The observed mean fitnesses (viable seeds per plant) after one growing season are:\n- $w_{M,Me} = 150$, $w_{M,Ro} = 20$,\n- $w_{R,Me} = 110$, $w_{R,Ro} = 80$.\n\nTo evaluate local adaptation, there are two common criteria:\n1) Local versus foreign at each site: a population is locally adapted at a site if, at that site, its fitness exceeds that of the foreign population. At $E_{Me}$, compare $w_{M,Me}$ to $w_{R,Me}$: since $150 > 110$, the Meadow population outperforms the foreign Roadside population at the Meadow site. At $E_{Ro}$, compare $w_{R,Ro}$ to $w_{M,Ro}$: since $80 > 20$, the Roadside population outperforms the foreign Meadow population at the Roadside site. Therefore, both populations satisfy the local-versus-foreign criterion, supporting A and B.\n\n2) Home versus away for each population: a population is locally adapted if its fitness at home exceeds its fitness away. For $M$, compare $w_{M,Me}$ to $w_{M,Ro}$: $150 > 20$, so $M$ has a home advantage. For $R$, compare $w_{R,Ro}$ to $w_{R,Me}$: $80  110$, so $R$ does not have a home advantage. Thus, if one required both criteria simultaneously for each population, only $M$ would qualify. However, the standard demonstration of local adaptation in reciprocal transplants is the local-versus-foreign criterion at each site, which both populations meet. Hence A and B are supported by the data.\n\nEvaluate phenotypic plasticity only (no genetic differences). If differences were entirely due to phenotypic plasticity with no genetic differentiation, then after controlling early development in a common greenhouse, there should be no consistent origin-based differences within a given environment. Yet at $E_{Me}$, $w_{M,Me} - w_{R,Me} = 150 - 110 = 40 > 0$, while at $E_{Ro}$, $w_{M,Ro} - w_{R,Ro} = 20 - 80 = -60  0$. The dependence of the performance difference on genotype indicates genetic differentiation and rules out a purely plastic explanation. Therefore C is not supported.\n\nAssess genotype-by-environment interaction (G-by-E). A G-by-E interaction is present if the effect of genotype on fitness depends on the environment. Here the difference changes sign across environments: at $E_{Me}$, $w_{M,Me} - w_{R,Me} = 40$, and at $E_{Ro}$, $w_{M,Ro} - w_{R,Ro} = -60$. The sign change indicates a crossover interaction (nonparallel reaction norms), confirming G-by-E. Thus D is supported.\n\nEvaluate a general-purpose genotype claim for the Roadside population. This would require $w_{R,Me} > w_{M,Me}$ and $w_{R,Ro} > w_{M,Ro}$ simultaneously. While $w_{R,Ro} = 80 > 20 = w_{M,Ro}$ holds at the Roadside site, at the Meadow site $w_{R,Me} = 110  150 = w_{M,Me}$. Therefore E is not supported.\n\nIn summary, the data support A, B, and D; they do not support C or E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "1968242"}, {"introduction": "After designing an experiment and observing an outcome, how can we be confident that the result supports our hypothesis?

This plant is known to produce two distinct types of flowers: open, cross-pollinating flowers called chasmogamous (CH) flowers, and closed, obligately self-pollinating flowers called cleistogamous (CL) flowers. The hypothesis posits that in environments where pollinators are scarce or unreliable, natural selection favors an increased investment in cleistogamous reproduction as a form of reproductive assurance.\n\nTo test this, the biologist conducts a long-term experiment in two large, isolated greenhouses.\n- **Greenhouse A (Pollinator-Rich):** A stable population of the plant's primary pollinator is maintained.\n- **Greenhouse B (Pollinator-Poor):** All pollinators are excluded.\n\nIdentical populations of *V. incognita* are established in both greenhouses and allowed to evolve for 50 generations.
