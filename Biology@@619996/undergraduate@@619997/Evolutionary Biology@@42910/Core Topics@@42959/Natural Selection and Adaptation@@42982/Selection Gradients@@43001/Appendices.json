This first practice provides a direct and practical application of the selection gradient, a key concept from the Lande-Arnold framework.

One of the key adaptive traits is the flowering time, measured in the number of days from the start of spring until the first flower opens. Over a five-year study period, the biologist meticulously recorded the flowering time and the total number of viable seeds produced by hundreds of individual plants. From this data, they calculated the relative fitness of each plant by dividing its seed count by the average seed count of the entire population for that year.\n\nSubsequent statistical analysis revealed two key population parameters. First, the phenotypic variance of flowering time was found to be 12.0 days-squared. Second, the covariance between flowering time and relative fitness was determined to be -2.40 days.\n\nUsing this information, calculate the linear selection gradient ($\\beta$) on flowering time for this plant population. Express your answer in units of per day (days⁻¹), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $z$ denote flowering time and $w$ denote relative fitness (dimensionless).

You will construct a fitness function, $W(z)$, based on a realistic biological trade-off between survival and reproduction, a common scenario in life-history evolution. This practice uses calculus to connect the underlying biological pressures to the resulting evolutionary trajectory, offering a deeper, mechanistic understanding of how fitness landscapes determine selection [@problem_id:1961560].", "problem": "Consider a population of annual plants where the key life-history trait under selection is the germination day, denoted by $z$, measured in days from the start of the potential growing season. An individual plant's fitness, $W(z)$, is determined by the interplay between survival and reproduction.\n\nThe probability of a plant surviving to maturity is dependent on its germination timing. Plants that germinate earlier face a higher risk of being killed by late-season frosts. The probability of survival, $S(z)$, for a plant germinating on day $z$ is modeled by the function $S(z) = 1 - \\exp(-z/\\tau_f)$, where $\\tau_f$ is a positive constant representing the characteristic time scale over which the frost risk diminishes.\n\nA plant's reproductive output (fecundity), $F(z)$, is determined by its total growth, which is negatively affected by delayed germination. Early germination provides a competitive advantage and a longer growing period. This relationship is modeled as a linear decrease in fecundity with germination day: $F(z) = F_{max} - c_1 z$, where $F_{max}$ is the maximum potential fecundity for a plant germinating at $z=0$ and $c_1$ is a positive constant representing the daily cost of delayed germination. Assume that $F_{max} - c_1 z > 0$ for all relevant germination times.\n\nThe total fitness of an individual is the product of its survival probability and its fecundity, so $W(z) = S(z) \\cdot F(z)$.\n\nThe selection gradient, $\\beta$, quantifies the strength and direction of directional selection on a trait. It is defined as the derivative of the relative fitness with respect to the trait, evaluated at the population mean trait value.

The degree of cooperation of an individual $i$ is a quantitative trait denoted by $z_i$, representing its investment in a social act ($z_i \\geq 0$).

The parameter $C$ is a positive constant representing the marginal cost of cooperation.\n\n2.  **Shared Benefit**: The same act of investment $z_i$ produces a total amount of benefit equal to $B \\cdot z_i$. The parameter $B$ is a positive constant representing the marginal benefit generated. This total benefit is distributed equally among all *other* members of the actor's group.
