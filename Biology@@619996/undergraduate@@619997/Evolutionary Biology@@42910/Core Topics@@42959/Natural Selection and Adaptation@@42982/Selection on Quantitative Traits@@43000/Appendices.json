This exercise provides a foundational look at partitioning the total observable, or phenotypic, variance ($V_P$) into its genetic and environmental components.

From a large sample of plants in their natural habitat, the total phenotypic variance ($V_P$) for stalk height was measured to be $184.0 \\text{ cm}^2$.\n\nTo dissect the contributions to this variation, the biologist conducted two further experiments. First, to estimate the environmental component, a large number of genetically identical clones were created from a single parent plant. These clones were then grown across a mosaic of environments designed to represent the full spectrum of conditions (soil quality, water availability, sunlight exposure) found in the plant's natural range. The variance in stalk height observed among these genetically identical clones was measured to be $105.0 \\text{ cm}^2$. This value is taken as the total environmental variance ($V_E$).\n\nSecond, a series of controlled breeding studies were performed using individuals sampled from the original wild population. Analysis of the resulting offspring allowed for the isolation of the\nvariance component attributable to dominance effects. The dominance variance ($V_D$) was estimated to be $32.0 \\text{ cm}^2$.\n\nAssuming that the variance due to epistatic interactions is negligible, calculate the narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) of stalk height for this population.

To find $h^2$, we must first determine the additive genetic variance, $V_A$.\n\nThe total phenotypic variance ($V_P$) can be decomposed into its constituent components. Under the assumption that epistatic variance is negligible, this relationship is:\n$$V_P = V_G + V_E$$\nwhere $V_G$ is the total genetic variance and $V_E$ is the environmental variance.\n\nThe total genetic variance ($V_G$) can itself be further decomposed into additive genetic variance ($V_A$) and dominance variance ($V_D$):\n$$V_G = V_A + V_D$$\n\nBy substituting the expression for $V_G$ into the equation for $V_P$, we get the full decomposition of phenotypic variance:\n$$V_P = V_A + V_D + V_E$$\n\nWe are given the following values from the problem statement:\n- Total phenotypic variance, $V_P = 184.0 \\text{ cm}^2$\n- Environmental variance, $V_E = 105.0 \\text{ cm}^2$\n- Dominance variance, $V_D = 32.0 \\text{ cm}^2$\n\nWe can rearrange the variance decomposition equation to solve for the unknown additive genetic variance, $V_A$:\n$$V_A = V_P - V_D - V_E$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$V_A = 184.0 \\text{ cm}^2 - 32.0 \\text{ cm}^2 - 105.0 \\text{ cm}^2$$\n$$V_A = 47.0 \\text{ cm}^2$$\n\nWith the value of $V_A$ calculated, we can now compute the narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) using its definition:\n$$h^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P} = \\frac{47.0 \\text{ cm}^2}{184.0 \\text{ cm}^2}$$\n\nThe units of $\\text{cm}^2$ cancel out, leaving a dimensionless ratio, as expected for heritability.\n$$h^2 = \\frac{47.0}{184.0} \\approx 0.25543478...$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$h^2 \\approx 0.255$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.255}$$", "id": "1961880"}, {"introduction": "While variance components give us a theoretical value for heritability, we can also measure it directly from the results of a selection experiment.
