This bimodal resource availability imposes strong disruptive selection on the plant's germination timing.

Your task is to mathematically model this conflict and find the tipping point where disruptive selection prevails, offering insight into how the interaction between different evolutionary forces drives the diversification of complex traits. [@problem_id:1919458]", "problem": "In a hypothetical species of lekking bird, males compete for mates by producing a complex signal with two components: an acoustic signal and a visual signal. The investment a male makes into the acoustic signal is denoted by $x$, and the investment into the visual signal is denoted by $y$. Due to a physiological trade-off, the total signaling investment for any male is constrained by a fixed energy budget, $E$, such that $x+y=E$. A male's signaling strategy is therefore determined by his choice of $x$ in the range $[0, E]$. A strategy with $x=E/2$ is termed \"generalist\", while strategies with $x=0$ or $x=E$ are termed \"specialists\".\n\nA male's overall reproductive success (fitness) depends on two factors: his mating success and his subsequent survival.\n\n1.  **Mating Success**: Females of this species exhibit a \"disjunctive\" mate choice rule, meaning they are disproportionately attracted to males who are exceptionally strong in either one of the signal components. This behavioral preference leads to a male's mating success, $W_{\\text{mate}}$, being proportional to the sum of the squares of his signal investments. This can be modeled as $W_{\\text{mate}}(x, y) = k_m (x^2 + y^2)$, where $k_m$ is a positive constant.\n\n2.  **Survival Cost**: Extreme specialization in signaling is physiologically costly, imposing a survival penalty. The probability of a male's survival after the breeding season, $W_{\\text{surv}}$, is highest for generalists and decreases for specialists.
