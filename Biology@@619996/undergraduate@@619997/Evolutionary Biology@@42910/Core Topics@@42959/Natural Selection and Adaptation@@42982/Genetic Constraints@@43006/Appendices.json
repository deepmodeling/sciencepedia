Each trait is controlled by a single gene with two alleles, exhibiting a simple dominant/recessive relationship.\n\nThe genetic loci are as follows:\n- **Antennal structure (Ant)**: The allele for feathery antennae ($F$) is dominant to the allele for simple antennae ($f$).\n- **Wing Pattern (Pat)**: The allele for spotted wings ($S$) is dominant to the allele for striped wings ($s$).\n- **Eye Luminescence (Lum)**: The allele for glowing eyes ($G$) is dominant to the allele for non-glowing eyes ($g$).\n\nAn initial cross is performed between a pure-breeding moth with feathery antennae, spotted wings, and glowing eyes and a pure-breeding moth with simple antennae, striped wings, and non-glowing eyes. The resulting F1 generation females, which are heterozygous for all three genes, are then subjected to a test cross with triple-recessive males (simple antennae, striped wings, non-glowing eyes).\n\nThe test cross produces a total of 2000 offspring with the following observed phenotypes and counts:\n\n- Feathery, Spotted, Glowing: 790\n- simple, striped, non-glowing: 780\n- simple, Spotted, Glowing: 162\n- Feathery, striped, non-glowing: 158\n- Feathery, Spotted, non-glowing: 42\n- simple, striped, Glowing: 48\n- simple, Spotted, non-glowing: 12\n- Feathery, striped, Glowing: 8\n\nBased on this data, determine the linear order of the three genes on the chromosome.

The data is insufficient to determine the order.", "solution": "The initial cross between a pure-breeding $F S G$ and a pure-breeding $f s g$ produces F1 females that are heterozygous in coupling phase, i.e., $F S G / f s g$. In the test cross of these F1 females to $f s g / f s g$ males, each offspring’s phenotype directly reveals the genotype of the maternal gamete at the three loci, because the tester contributes recessive alleles at all loci.\n\nFrom the 2000 testcross progeny, the two most frequent classes are Feathery, Spotted, Glowing ($F S G$) with $790$ and simple, striped, non-glowing ($f s g$) with $780$. These are the nonrecombinant (parental) gametes, establishing the parental haplotypes as $F S G$ and $f s g$.\n\nThe two least frequent classes are simple, Spotted, non-glowing ($f S g$) with $12$ and Feathery, striped, Glowing ($F s G$) with $8$. These are the double-crossover (DCO) gametes. In a three-point cross, the DCO genotypes differ from the parental genotypes only at the middle locus.\n\nTo determine the middle gene, compare each DCO to the corresponding parental:\n- Compare $F S G$ (parental) to $F s G$ (DCO): only the $P$ allele changes ($S \\to s$), while $A$ and $L$ remain $F$ and $G$.\n- Compare $f s g$ (parental) to $f S g$ (DCO): only the $P$ allele changes ($s \\to S$), while $A$ and $L$ remain $f$ and $g$.\n\nThus, the locus $P$ is in the middle. Therefore, the linear order is $A - P - L$, which corresponds to option A. The strong deviation from equal frequencies also shows the loci are linked, and the data are sufficient to resolve the order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1933190"}, {"introduction": "Physical linkage between genes often creates non-random associations of alleles in a population, a state known as linkage disequilibrium (LD). However, these associations are not permanent.

Calculating the rate of this decay is key to understanding how quickly a population can shuffle its genetic deck to create new combinations of traits.", "problem": "In a population of the fictional beetle species *Coleoptera synteticus*, two genetic loci are studied.

Locus B controls elytron (wing case) coloration, with allele $B_1$ producing black elytra and $B_2$ producing brown elytra. After a widespread application of the pesticide which resulted in a massive die-off of susceptible individuals, a population geneticist observes a significant non-random association between the alleles at these two loci. This association is quantified by a measure known as Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), which is initially found to have a value of $D = 0.20$.\n\nSubsequent genetic mapping studies reveal that the recombination rate between Locus A and Locus B is $r = 0.05$.

This thought experiment [@problem_id:1933199] places you in the role of an evolutionary biologist tasked with distinguishing between two possibilities: a single gene with opposing effects (pleiotropy) or two tightly linked genes. Devising an experiment to solve this puzzle reveals the crucial difference between an absolute genetic constraint and one that can eventually be overcome by recombination and selection.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying a species of wild grass. Through a cross between two pure-breeding lines—one with high seed mass but low drought tolerance, and the other with low seed mass but high drought tolerance—they perform a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis on the F2 generation. The analysis reveals a single, strong QTL peak on chromosome 3 that is associated with both traits. An allele from the first parent, let's call it $Q_1$, significantly increases seed mass but decreases drought tolerance. The allele from the second parent, $Q_2$, has the opposite effects.\n\nTwo hypotheses are proposed to explain this observation:\n1.  **Pleiotropy Hypothesis:** The QTL corresponds to a single gene where the $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ alleles have pleiotropic effects on both seed mass and drought tolerance.\n2.  **Linkage Hypothesis:** The QTL region actually contains two distinct, tightly linked genes. One gene, $M$, affects seed mass ($M_1$ for high mass, $M_2$ for low mass), and the other gene, $D$, affects drought tolerance ($D_1$ for low tolerance, $D_2$ for high tolerance). The observed association is due to the parental lines having haplotypes $M_1 D_1$ and $M_2 D_2$. The two genes are separated by a small genetic distance, resulting in a low recombination rate, $r$, between them, where $r > 0$.\n\nTo distinguish between these two hypotheses, the biologist creates a very large, new F2 population from the original cross. Then, for 10 consecutive generations, they apply strong artificial selection by only allowing individuals with both the highest seed mass and the highest drought tolerance to reproduce.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes of this long-term selection experiment would provide the strongest evidence for the Linkage Hypothesis over the Pleiotropy Hypothesis?\n\nA. The population mean for seed mass increases, while the mean for drought tolerance decreases, strengthening the negative correlation between the two traits.\n\nB. The population splits into two distinct subpopulations: one with very high seed mass and low drought tolerance, and another with very low seed mass and high drought tolerance.\n\nC. After several generations, the negative correlation between seed mass and drought tolerance weakens, and individuals with both high seed mass and high drought tolerance appear and increase in frequency.\n\nD. Both seed mass and drought tolerance converge toward the intermediate F1 phenotype, and the variance for both traits decreases to zero.\n\nE. DNA sequencing reveals that the physical distance between the markers defining the QTL peak is extremely small, confirming the tight physical proximity of any genes within that region.", "solution": "We formalize the two hypotheses in terms of genotype-to-phenotype mapping and the effect of selection and recombination.\n\n1) Under the Pleiotropy Hypothesis, there is a single locus $Q$ with two alleles. Let the additive effects on seed mass be $+a$ for $Q_{1}$ and $-a$ for $Q_{2}$, and the additive effects on drought tolerance be $-b$ for $Q_{1}$ and $+b$ for $Q_{2}$, where $a>0$ and $b>0$. Then the three genotypes have trait values:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ_{1}Q_{1}&:\\quad \\text{mass}=+2a,\\quad \\text{drought}=-2b,\\\\\nQ_{1}Q_{2}&:\\quad \\text{mass}=0,\\quad \\text{drought}=0,\\\\\nQ_{2}Q_{2}&:\\quad \\text{mass}=-2a,\\quad \\text{drought}=+2b.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSelection is imposed to favor individuals with both the highest seed mass and the highest drought tolerance. Under this single-locus antagonism, no genotype has both traits high simultaneously. The heterozygote $Q_{1}Q_{2}$ is intermediate in both traits and cannot achieve the joint extreme. Therefore, sustained selection for joint high-high cannot produce individuals with both traits high at this locus; the negative correlation induced by this antagonistic pleiotropy persists. Consequently, observing the emergence and increase of individuals that are simultaneously high for both traits is not expected under pleiotropy at this QTL.\n\n2) Under the Linkage Hypothesis, there are two loci, $M$ (mass) with alleles $M_{1}$ (high mass) and $M_{2}$ (low mass), and $D$ (drought) with alleles $D_{1}$ (low tolerance) and $D_{2}$ (high tolerance). The parental haplotypes are $M_{1}D_{1}$ and $M_{2}D_{2}$, and the recombination rate between $M$ and $D$ is $r$ with $r>0$. Let the haplotype frequencies be\n$$\nx_{11}=p_{M_{1}D_{1}},\\quad x_{12}=p_{M_{1}D_{2}},\\quad x_{21}=p_{M_{2}D_{1}},\\quad x_{22}=p_{M_{2}D_{2}},\n$$\nwith linkage disequilibrium $D=x_{11}x_{22}-x_{12}x_{21}>0$ initially (coupling of $M_{1}D_{1}$ and $M_{2}D_{2}$). Recombination changes haplotype frequencies according to\n$$\nx_{11}'=x_{11}-rD,\\quad x_{12}'=x_{12}+rD,\\quad x_{21}'=x_{21}+rD,\\quad x_{22}'=x_{22}-rD.\n$$\nThus, for any $r>0$ and $D>0$, recombination generates the recombinant haplotype $M_{1}D_{2}$ at rate $rD$, i.e., $x_{12}$ increases purely by recombination. Under the imposed selection regime that only allows individuals with both high mass and high drought tolerance to reproduce, genotypes carrying the favorable recombinant haplotype $M_{1}D_{2}$ (and ultimately the double homozygote $M_{1}M_{1}D_{2}D_{2}$) have the highest fitness. Therefore, after several generations, selection increases the allele frequencies of $M_{1}$ at $M$ and $D_{2}$ at $D$, and also builds positive association between them, further increasing $x_{12}$. This process weakens and can reverse the initial negative correlation between the traits because individuals with both high mass and high drought tolerance (carrying $M_{1}D_{2}$) appear and rise in frequency. Hence, the observation of such individuals increasing over time is a direct consequence of $r>0$ and selection, and is strongly consistent with linkage of two distinct loci rather than pleiotropy at a single locus.\n\n3) Evaluate the options:\n- A: An increase in mass with a decrease in drought tolerance under selection for both traits contradicts the selection regime and is consistent with antagonistic pleiotropy; it does not support linkage over pleiotropy.\n- B: Splitting into two subpopulations with opposite trait combinations is inconsistent with selecting only those with both high traits; it does not support linkage.\n- C: The weakening of the negative correlation and the rise of individuals with both high mass and high drought tolerance matches the expected generation and selection of recombinant $M_{1}D_{2}$ haplotypes when $r>0$, which directly supports the Linkage Hypothesis over Pleiotropy.\n- D: Convergence to the intermediate F1 phenotype and vanishing variance suggests loss of segregating variation or dominance patterns, not the predicted outcome of recombination plus selection for the joint extreme; it does not support linkage over pleiotropy.\n- E: Extremely small physical distance does not distinguish a single pleiotropic gene from two very tightly linked genes; it is not decisive evidence favoring linkage over pleiotropy.\n\nTherefore, the outcome that most strongly supports the Linkage Hypothesis is the appearance and increase of individuals with both high seed mass and high drought tolerance and a weakening of the negative correlation, i.e., option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1933199"}]}
