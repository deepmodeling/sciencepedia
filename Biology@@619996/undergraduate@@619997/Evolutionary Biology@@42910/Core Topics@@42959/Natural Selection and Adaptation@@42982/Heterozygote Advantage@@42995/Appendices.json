The fitness of the heterozygous genotype, $Aa$, is the highest and is set as the benchmark with a value of $w_{Aa} = 1.0$. The relative fitness of the homozygous dominant genotype, $AA$, is measured to be $w_{AA} = 0.70$. The relative fitness of the homozygous recessive genotype, $aa$, is measured to be $w_{aa} = 0.40$.\n\nIn the standard model of heterozygote advantage, the reduction in fitness for the homozygous genotypes is quantified by selection coefficients.
