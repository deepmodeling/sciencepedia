This exercise [@problem_id:1974785] explores the consequences of a dominant mutation that prevents an organism from reaching reproductive age. By analyzing this extreme scenario, you will establish a fundamental benchmark for the impact of selection and solidify your understanding of how the selection coefficient, $s$, formally quantifies a complete loss of fitness.", "problem": "In a laboratory population of flour beetles (genus *Tribolium*), a spontaneous mutation gives rise to a new, dominant allele, which we will call $A$. The original, wild-type allele is recessive and denoted by $a$.\n\nThe presence of the dominant allele $A$ is associated with a severe developmental defect. Any individual with at least one copy of the $A$ allele (i.e., genotypes $AA$ or $Aa$) fails to survive the pupal stage and thus dies before reaching sexual maturity. Individuals with the homozygous recessive genotype, $aa$, have a normal life cycle and reproductive rate.\n\nIn population genetics, the concept of relative fitness ($W$) is used to quantify the reproductive success of a genotype relative to the most successful genotype in the population. The selection coefficient ($s$) measures the intensity of negative selection acting on a genotype and is defined by the relationship $s = 1 - W$.\n\nBased on this information, what is the selection coefficient ($s$) acting against any individual beetle carrying the dominant lethal allele $A$?\n\nA. $0$\n\nB. $0.25$\n\nC. $0.5$\n\nD. $1.0$\n\nE. It cannot be determined without knowing the initial frequency of the $A$ allele.\n\nF. It cannot be determined without knowing the total population size.", "solution": "By definition, relative fitness $W$ is measured relative to the most successful genotype. Since only $aa$ individuals survive to reproduce, set the reference fitness $W_{aa}=1$. Any individual carrying at least one $A$ allele (genotypes $AA$ or $Aa$) dies before sexual maturity, so their reproductive success is zero:\n$$\nW_{AA}=0, \\quad W_{Aa}=0, \\quad W_{aa}=1.\n$$\nThe selection coefficient is defined as $s=1-W$ for the genotype under consideration. Therefore, for any individual carrying the dominant lethal allele $A$,\n$$\ns=1-W=1-0=1.\n$$\nThis does not depend on allele frequency or population size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1974785"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary success is rarely about perfecting a single attribute; it's often a game of trade-offs. This problem [@problem_id:1974765] delves into a more nuanced scenario where fitness is a composite of different life-history traitsâ€”in this case, larval survival versus adult fecundity. This practice will sharpen your ability to calculate absolute fitness from its core components and appreciate how natural selection balances competing pressures to determine the most successful overall strategy.", "problem": "In a population of insects, two distinct genotypes, A and B, exist at a specific genetic locus. These genotypes exhibit different life-history traits. Individuals with Genotype A have a larval survival rate of 90% and, upon reaching adulthood, produce an average of 50 offspring. In contrast, individuals with Genotype B have a lower larval survival rate of 60% but are more fecund, producing an average of 100 offspring as adults.\n\nThe absolute fitness of a genotype in this population is defined as the product of its larval survival rate and its average adult fecundity. The selection coefficient measures the strength of natural selection against a less-fit genotype relative to the most-fit genotype.\n\nCalculate the selection coefficient that quantifies the selective disadvantage of Genotype A relative to Genotype B.

This final, integrative exercise [@problem_id:1974770] challenges you to analyze a realistic case of genotype-by-environment interaction, where an allele is beneficial in one context but costly in another. By calculating an average fitness across a varied landscape, you will see firsthand how the selection coefficient, $s$, is a dynamic property that depends on the ecological stage where evolution unfolds.", "problem": "A plant geneticist is studying the fitness effects of a single gene that confers resistance to a fungal pathogen in a species of commercial grain. The gene has two alleles: a resistant allele, `R`, and a susceptible allele, `S`. The study is conducted in a large agricultural region where the environment is heterogeneous. A fraction $f = 0.70$ of the region is characterized by damp, low-lying soil where the pathogen is endemic. The remaining fraction $1-f$ of the region consists of well-drained highlands where the pathogen is absent.\n\nThe geneticist measures the grain yield as a proxy for the absolute fitness of the three possible genotypes (`RR`, `RS`, `SS`) in each environmental condition.\n\nIn the pathogen-free highlands, a metabolic cost associated with the `R` allele is observed:\n- The `SS` genotype produces a baseline yield of 2500 kg per hectare.\n- The `RR` genotype's yield is 6.0% lower than that of the `SS` genotype.\n- The `RS` genotype's yield is 3.0% lower than that of the `SS` genotype.\n\nIn the pathogen-infested lowlands, the selective advantage of the `R` allele is apparent:\n- The `RR` genotype is the most productive, yielding 2200 kg per hectare.\n- The `RS` genotype's yield is 20.0% lower than that of the `RR` genotype in this environment.\n- The `SS` genotype's yield is 60.0% lower than that of the `RR` genotype in this environment.\n\nAssuming the genotypes are randomly distributed throughout the entire region, calculate the overall selection coefficient, $s$, that acts against the homozygous susceptible (`SS`) genotype relative to the most fit genotype in this mixed environment.
