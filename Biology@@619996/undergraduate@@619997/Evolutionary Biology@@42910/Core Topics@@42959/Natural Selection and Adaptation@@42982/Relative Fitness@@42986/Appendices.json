Two primary genotypes exist within the population concerning this resistance: a homozygous susceptible genotype, denoted `SS`, and a homozygous resistant genotype, denoted `RR`.\n\nA large field is infested with a starting population of larvae from the previous generation, consisting of 50,000 `SS` individuals and 50,000 `RR` individuals. After the field is sprayed with the pesticide, the survival rates of the larvae to reproductive adulthood are measured. The survival rate for the `SS` genotype is 18.0%, while the survival rate for the `RR` genotype is 76.0%.\n\nThe resistance mechanism in the `RR` genotype incurs a metabolic cost, which manifests as reduced fecundity compared to the `SS` genotype. The average number of offspring laid by a surviving `SS` female is 110. The average number of offspring laid by a surviving `RR` female is 85. For both genotypes, assume a 1:1 sex ratio among the surviving adults.\n\nCalculate the relative fitness of the susceptible (`SS`) genotype.

You'll explore the crucial concept of genotype-by-environment interactions, where a genotype's success depends entirely on the specific challenges and opportunities of its surroundings.", "problem": "A team of botanists is studying the population genetics of a newly discovered plant species, *Ficticia spectabilis*, which grows in an isolated mountain basin. The basin is divided into two ecologically distinct environments: a 'Sunken Hollow' characterized by moist soil and low light due to a dense canopy, and an 'Exposed Ridge' with dry soil and high sun exposure. The plant species exhibits three distinct, genetically-controlled phenotypes:\n\n1.  **'Canopia'**: A tall, broad-leafed phenotype.\n2.  **'Saxum'**: A short, waxy-leafed phenotype.\n3.  **'Intermedia'**: A phenotype with traits intermediate between 'Canopia' and 'Saxum'.\n\nThe botanists measured the average reproductive output, a proxy for absolute fitness, by counting the number of viable seeds produced per plant per generation in each environment. Their findings are as follows:\n\n*   **In the Sunken Hollow:**\n    *   'Canopia' plants produced an average of 250 viable seeds.\n    *   'Saxum' plants produced an average of 85 viable seeds.\n    *   'Intermedia' plants produced an average of 215 viable seeds.\n\n*   **In the Exposed Ridge:**\n    *   'Canopia' plants produced an average of 110 viable seeds.\n    *   'Saxum' plants produced an average of 195 viable seeds.\n    *   'Intermedia' plants produced an average of 160 viable seeds.\n\nCalculate the relative fitness of the 'Canopia' phenotype in the Exposed Ridge environment. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the relative fitness of the 'Canopia' phenotype within the 'Exposed Ridge' environment.\n\nFirst, we must understand the concept of relative fitness. Relative fitness, denoted by $w$, quantifies the reproductive success of a particular genotype or phenotype relative to the most successful genotype or phenotype in the same environment. It is a normalized measure, calculated by dividing the absolute fitness of the phenotype of interest by the absolute fitness of the most reproductively successful phenotype. The problem states that the average number of viable seeds is used as a proxy for absolute fitness.\n\nThe problem provides data for two distinct environments: the 'Sunken Hollow' and the 'Exposed Ridge'. Since the question specifically asks for the relative fitness in the 'Exposed Ridge', we must only use the data collected from that environment. The data from the 'Sunken Hollow' is irrelevant for this calculation.\n\nThe absolute fitness values (average number of viable seeds) for each phenotype in the 'Exposed Ridge' are:\n*   Absolute fitness of 'Canopia', $W_{Canopia} = 110$\n*   Absolute fitness of 'Saxum', $W_{Saxum} = 195$\n*   Absolute fitness of 'Intermedia', $W_{Intermedia} = 160$\n\nTo calculate relative fitness, we first need to identify the phenotype with the highest absolute fitness in this environment. Comparing the values:\n$W_{Saxum} = 195$ is the highest value among the three phenotypes ($195 > 160 > 110$).\nTherefore, the 'Saxum' phenotype is the most fit in the 'Exposed Ridge' environment. We will use its absolute fitness as the reference value for normalization. Let $W_{max}$ be this maximum absolute fitness.\n$$W_{max} = W_{Saxum} = 195$$\nBy definition, the relative fitness of the most fit phenotype is 1.\n\nThe relative fitness of the 'Canopia' phenotype, $w_{Canopia}$, is calculated using the formula:\n$$w_{Canopia} = \\frac{W_{Canopia}}{W_{max}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into the equation:\n$$w_{Canopia} = \\frac{110}{195}$$\n\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$w_{Canopia} \\approx 0.56410256...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are 5, 6, and 4. The fourth significant figure is 1, which is less than 5, so we round down.\n\nThus, the relative fitness of the 'Canopia' phenotype in the Exposed Ridge is approximately 0.564.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.564}$$", "id": "1960108"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary success is not just about the number of offspring, but also about the timing of their production. This exercise delves into the fascinating world of life-history strategy, where natural selection balances the benefits of reproducing early against the potential for greater fecundity later in life. By analyzing a scenario involving an annual and a biennial plant [@problem_id:1960083], you will see how survival probability over time integrates with reproductive schedules to shape a genotype's ultimate fitness.", "problem": "In a population of a biennial plant, *Silene carminae*, a genetic variant has emerged that alters its life-history strategy.

The mutant genotype (Genotype B) exhibits an annual life cycle, flowering and setting seed at the end of its first year, producing an average of $N_B = 50$ seeds before dying. Both genotypes are subject to the same environmental pressures, resulting in a constant annual probability of mortality of $10\\%$ for any plant that has not yet reproduced.\n\nAssuming that seed germination rates and offspring survival are identical for both genotypes, calculate the relative fitness of the early-flowering mutant (Genotype B). The relative fitness of a genotype is defined as its absolute fitness divided by the absolute fitness of the most-fit genotype in the population. Express your answer as a numerical value rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $s$ denote the annual survival probability for a plant that has not yet reproduced. Given an annual mortality of $0.10$, we have $s = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n\nAbsolute fitness is the expected number of seeds produced per individual, accounting for pre-reproductive survival. For the biennial wild type (Genotype A), reproduction occurs at the end of the second year, so survival to reproduction is $s^{2}$.
