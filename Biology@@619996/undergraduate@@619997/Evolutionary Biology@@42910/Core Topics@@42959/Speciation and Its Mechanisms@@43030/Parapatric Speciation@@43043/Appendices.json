{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A crucial skill for any evolutionary biologist is to interpret evidence from the field to deduce the underlying evolutionary processes. This first exercise presents a classic ecological scenario involving snail populations distributed across a sharp environmental boundary. By carefully analyzing the observations about their distribution, adaptations, and genetic interactions, you can practice distinguishing parapatric speciation from other modes, such as allopatric and sympatric speciation [@problem_id:1952247].", "problem": "A team of ecologists is studying a species of small, non-migratory terrestrial snail. These snails inhabit a large, continuous geographical area. A prominent geological feature of this area is a sharp transition between two soil types: a nutrient-rich loam that covers most of the region, and a distinct outcrop of serpentine soil, which is high in heavy metals and low in essential nutrients like calcium.\n\nThe researchers make several key observations:\n1.  The snails are continuously distributed across the entire area, with no physical barriers separating the populations on the two soil types.\n2.  Snails living on the loam soil predominantly exhibit a dark, uniformly colored shell, which provides excellent camouflage against the dark, humus-rich ground.\n3.  Snails living on the serpentine soil predominantly exhibit a light, banded shell, which provides effective camouflage against the pale, rocky substrate. These snails also possess physiological adaptations to tolerate the high heavy-metal content of the soil.\n4.  Genetic analysis confirms that there is ongoing, albeit limited, gene flow between the two populations. This is evident from shared neutral genetic markers.\n5.  A narrow \"contact zone\" exists along the boundary between the two soil types where hybrid snails (offspring of parents from the different soil types) are found. These hybrids exhibit intermediate shell patterns and reduced fitness compared to either parent population when in their respective native habitats.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following modes of speciation most accurately describes the evolutionary process occurring in this snail population?\n\nA. Allopatric speciation, which requires complete geographical isolation by a physical barrier.\n\nB. Sympatric speciation, which occurs when populations diverge while living in the exact same location, without any geographical separation or gradient.\n\nC. Parapatric speciation, which occurs between adjacent populations across a continuous range with a strong environmental gradient.\n\nD. Peripatric speciation, which is a subtype of allopatric speciation where a new species forms from a small, isolated peripheral population.", "solution": "We identify the speciation mode by matching the observations to definitions of the options.\n\nFirst, allopatric speciation (option A) requires complete geographical isolation by a physical barrier that prevents gene flow. The observations state that the snails are continuously distributed across the area with no physical barriers and that genetic analysis confirms ongoing gene flow, so this contradicts allopatry. Therefore, A is not supported.\n\nSecond, sympatric speciation (option B) occurs when divergence happens within the same geographic location, without spatial separation or an environmental gradient structuring the divergence. In sympatry, disruptive selection and assortative mating arise within a single continuous habitat, not across a spatial environmental boundary. Here there is a sharp environmental transition between loam and serpentine soils and a contact zone, indicating spatial environmental structure. Therefore, B is not supported.\n\nThird, parapatric speciation (option C) occurs between adjacent populations along a continuous range where there is a strong environmental gradient, leading to divergent local adaptation with limited gene flow and often a hybrid zone with reduced hybrid fitness. The observations match this: there is a continuous distribution with no physical barrier, a sharp transition in environment (loam versus serpentine), distinct locally adapted phenotypes (shell coloration patterns and physiological heavy-metal tolerance), evidence of limited gene flow, and a narrow contact zone with hybrids of reduced fitness in the parental habitats. These are characteristic features of parapatric divergence with a tension zone or selection against hybrids. Therefore, C is supported.\n\nFourth, peripatric speciation (option D) is a form of allopatry where a small, isolated peripheral population splits off, typically experiencing strong drift and founder effects due to isolation. The system described lacks a small isolated peripheral population and shows ongoing gene flow across a boundary rather than isolation, so D is not supported.\n\nThus, the mode of speciation most consistent with the evidence is parapatric speciation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1952247"}, {"introduction": "Parapatric speciation is fundamentally a balancing act between two opposing forces: divergent selection, which pulls populations apart, and gene flow, which pushes them together. This next practice moves from simple identification to understanding this core dynamic. You will explore a hypothetical case of wildflower adaptation to contaminated soil to determine the condition under which divergence can overcome the homogenizing effect of migration [@problem_id:1952249].", "problem": "Consider two large, contiguous populations of a wildflower species, Population A and Population B. They live in adjacent patches of land with a narrow zone of contact where individuals can interbreed, resulting in a constant, low rate of gene flow between them. Population A grows in soil with a standard mineral composition, while Population B grows in soil contaminated with a high concentration of a specific heavy metal, which is toxic to the standard genotype. A new mutation arises in Population B that confers tolerance to the heavy metal, but this same mutation incurs a slight metabolic cost, reducing reproductive fitness in the non-contaminated soil of Population A's range. The rate of gene flow (migration) between the two populations is non-zero.\n\nAssuming parapatric speciation is underway, which of the following statements most accurately describes the conditions necessary for significant genetic divergence to occur and be maintained between these two populations, potentially leading to the formation of new species?\n\nA. Divergence will occur only if the strength of natural selection favoring different alleles in each environment is greater than the homogenizing effect of gene flow between the populations.\n\nB. As long as there is any gene flow, the two populations will inevitably become genetically homogenized, and speciation cannot occur.\n\nC. Genetic drift alone is sufficient to cause divergence between the two populations, provided the rate of gene flow is low.\n\nD. Divergence is primarily driven by the accumulation of different random mutations in each population, and the roles of selection and gene flow are secondary.\n\nE. Natural selection will lead to divergence regardless of the rate of gene flow, because the environmental pressures are different.", "solution": "Define a single locus with two alleles: $T$ (heavy-metal tolerance) and $t$ (standard). Let $p_{A}$ and $p_{B}$ denote the frequency of $T$ in Population A (clean soil) and Population B (contaminated soil), respectively.\n\nAssign relative fitnesses reflecting local adaptation with a cost:\n- In Population A (costly tolerance): $w_{T}^{A}=1-s_{A}$ and $w_{t}^{A}=1$, where $s_{A}>0$.\n- In Population B (beneficial tolerance): $w_{T}^{B}=1+s_{B}$ and $w_{t}^{B}=1$, where $s_{B}>0$.\n\nLet the symmetric migration (gene flow) rate between populations be $m$ with $0<m<1$. Selection acts within each population before migration. After selection and before migration, allele frequencies update to\n$$\n\\tilde{p}_{A}=\\frac{p_{A}(1-s_{A})}{1-s_{A}p_{A}},\\qquad \\tilde{p}_{B}=\\frac{p_{B}(1+s_{B})}{1+s_{B}p_{B}}.\n$$\nMigration then mixes individuals:\n$$\np_{A}^{+}=(1-m)\\tilde{p}_{A}+m\\tilde{p}_{B},\\qquad p_{B}^{+}=(1-m)\\tilde{p}_{B}+m\\tilde{p}_{A}.\n$$\nAt equilibrium, $p_{A}^{+}=p_{A}$ and $p_{B}^{+}=p_{B}$. To see the condition qualitatively, use the weak-selection, weak-migration approximation (keeping leading terms in $s_{A},s_{B},m$). The change in $T$ in each population can be written as\n$$\n\\Delta p_{A}\\approx -s_{A}p_{A}(1-p_{A})+m(p_{B}-p_{A}),\\qquad\n\\Delta p_{B}\\approx +s_{B}p_{B}(1-p_{B})+m(p_{A}-p_{B}).\n$$\n- The terms $\\pm s_{i}p_{i}(1-p_{i})$ capture divergent selection: $T$ is selected against in A and for in B.\n- The terms $m(p_{j}-p_{i})$ capture homogenizing gene flow, which drives $p_{A}$ and $p_{B}$ toward equality.\n\nA stable divergence with $p_{B}>p_{A}$ requires that the opposing selection terms dominate the homogenizing migration terms. In the classic migration–selection balance, a protected divergence exists when migration is sufficiently weak relative to selection, i.e., when $m$ is smaller than the relevant selection coefficients. A commonly stated sufficient condition is that selection exceeds migration in each habitat, for example,\n$$\nm< s_{A}\\quad \\text{and}\\quad m< s_{B},\n$$\nso that local selection can prevent swamping by migrants and maintain different allele frequencies. Conversely, if $m$ is large relative to $s_{A}$ and $s_{B}$, then $m(p_{B}-p_{A})$ dominates, yielding $p_{A}=p_{B}$ at equilibrium and eliminating divergence.\n\nApplying this to the options:\n- A correctly states the migration–selection balance principle: significant divergence is maintained only if divergent selection is stronger than the homogenizing effect of gene flow.\n- B is false because nonzero gene flow does not preclude divergence when selection is strong enough relative to $m$.\n- C is false because with nonzero migration and large populations, genetic drift alone cannot maintain stable, environment-matched divergence.\n- D is false because in parapatry with ongoing gene flow, divergent natural selection is the primary driver of maintained differentiation; random mutation without selection cannot reliably overcome gene flow.\n- E is false because sufficiently high gene flow can swamp selection; selection does not guarantee divergence regardless of $m$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1952249"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical push-and-pull between selection and gene flow leaves tangible footprints in nature, which we can learn to read. This final practice examines one of the most famous real-world examples of a hybrid zone: that of the European house mouse. By applying a simple mathematical model, you will see how the physical width of this zone directly reflects the relative strengths of gene flow (represented by dispersal distance, $\\sigma$) and selection against hybrids (represented by the coefficient $s$), allowing us to infer the power of these evolutionary forces from geographic patterns [@problem_id:1952244].", "problem": "In central Europe, two subspecies of the house mouse, *Mus musculus musculus* and *Mus musculus domesticus*, meet and form a narrow hybrid zone.

Allele $A_1$ is nearly fixed in the *musculus* population, while allele $A_2$ is nearly fixed in the *domesticus* population. Within the hybrid zone, there is selection against heterozygote individuals ($A_1A_2$), which have reduced fitness compared to the parental genotypes.\n\nThe width of such a hybrid zone (or the steepness of the cline in allele frequencies) is determined by a balance between the rate of gene flow, which tends to broaden the zone, and the strength of selection, which tends to narrow it. A classic model in population genetics approximates the width of this \"tension zone,\" $w$, with the following relationship:\n$$w \\propto \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{s}}$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the mean dispersal distance of individuals per generation (a measure of gene flow), and $s$ is the selection coefficient representing the fitness reduction of the heterozygotes.\n\nField biologists observe that the cline for this particular allele is extremely steep, meaning the transition from a high frequency of $A_1$ to a high frequency of $A_2$ occurs over a very short geographic distance. In other words, the width $w$ is very small. What does this observation imply about the likely magnitudes of gene flow and selection in this hybrid zone?\n\nA.
