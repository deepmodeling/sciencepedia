These fish inhabit two geographically isolated, high-altitude river systems: the Crystal River and the Sunstone River. The two rivers have had no connection for the last 50,000 years. To determine the taxonomic status of these populations, the biologist conducts a genetic analysis on a large number of individuals from the Crystal River (Population C), the Sunstone River (Population S), and a closely related but distinct species from a third river, the Garnet Darter (Population G), which serves as an outgroup.\n\nThe phylogenetic analysis, based on several nuclear and mitochondrial genes, reveals the following relationships and genetic markers:\n1.  Populations C and S share a more recent common ancestor with each other than either does with the outgroup, Population G.\n2.  All individuals sampled from Population C possess a unique allele, designated `F-ATPase-c`, which is fixed in this population. This allele is not found in any individuals from Population S or Population G.\n3.  All individuals sampled from Population S possess a different unique allele, designated `NADH-s`, which is fixed in this population. This allele is not found in any individuals from Population C or Population G.\n\nBased on these findings, and strictly applying the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC), how should the biologist classify the Emerald Darter populations from the Crystal and Sunstone rivers?\n\nA. As a single species, because they share a more recent common ancestor with each other than with the outgroup.\n\nB. As a single species, because an absence of gene flow does not by itself define a species.\n\nC. As two distinct species, because they live in allopatry and have been geographically isolated for a long time.\n\nD. As two distinct species, because each population represents a diagnosable group defined by a unique, fixed character.\n\nE. It is impossible to determine their species status without testing if individuals from Population C and Population S can produce viable, fertile offspring.", "solution": "Define the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC): Under PSC (e.g., Cracraft), a species is the smallest aggregation of populations diagnosable by a unique combination of character states and forming a monophyletic unit. The key operational criterion is diagnosability by fixed character differences; reproductive compatibility or geographic context are not required criteria.\n\nApply the given evidence:\n1. The phylogeny shows that Populations C and S share a more recent common ancestor with each other than with the outgroup G. This establishes that C and S together form a clade relative to G, but PSC assigns species status at the smallest diagnosable units, not necessarily at the level of a larger clade that contains subdivided, diagnosable terminal units.\n2. Population C possesses a unique allele, F-ATPase-c, fixed in all sampled individuals and absent from S and G. This is a fixed, unique character diagnosing C.\n3. Population S possesses a different unique allele, NADH-s, fixed in all sampled individuals and absent from C and G. This is a fixed, unique character diagnosing S.\n\nInference under PSC:\n- Each population (C and S) is individually diagnosable by a unique, fixed character state not shared with the other population or the outgroup. Therefore, each constitutes a diagnosable lineage.\n- Because PSC recognizes the smallest diagnosable monophyletic units as species, the presence of reciprocal, fixed diagnostic characters in C and S warrants recognizing them as two distinct species.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A is incorrect: Sharing a more recent common ancestor does not collapse diagnosable terminal units into a single species under PSC.\n- B is incorrect: Gene flow is not a criterion under PSC; diagnosability is.\n- C is incorrect: Allopatry and duration of isolation are not defining criteria under PSC.\n- D is correct: Each population is a diagnosable group defined by unique, fixed characters.\n- E is incorrect: Testing reproductive compatibility pertains to the Biological Species Concept, not PSC.\n\nConclusion: Under PSC, the Emerald Darter populations from the Crystal and Sunstone rivers should be classified as two distinct species based on fixed, unique, diagnostic characters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1954336"}, {"introduction": "While the concept of diagnosable monophyly is clear, real-world genetic data can be complex and sometimes contradictory. This practice [@problem_id:1954322] delves into the common challenge of gene tree-species tree discordance, where different parts of the genome tell conflicting stories about evolutionary history due to processes like hybridization. Your task is to weigh the evidence and decide which genetic signal more accurately reflects the organism's species boundary, a critical skill for any evolutionary biologist.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying two populations of oaks that are each other's closest relatives. One population, which she provisionally names *Quercus altus*, is found only at high elevations, while the other, *Quercus humilis*, is found only in adjacent low-lying valleys. To determine their species status, she sequences both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from multiple individuals of both populations.\n\nThe phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA, which represents the overall genetic history of the organisms, shows that all individuals of *Q. altus* form a single, well-supported monophyletic group, and all individuals of *Q. humilis* also form their own well-supported monophyletic group. The two groups are reciprocally monophyletic.\n\nHowever, the analysis of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is maternally inherited, reveals a different pattern. While the *Q. altus* individuals still form a monophyletic group, the *Q. humilis* lineage is paraphyletic. Specifically, the mtDNA of some *Q. humilis* individuals is nested within the *Q. altus* clade, making the *Q. altus* clade and these few *Q. humilis* individuals a sister group to the rest of the *Q. humilis* individuals. This pattern is strong evidence of historical hybridization and the flow of genes (introgression) from *Q. altus* mothers to *Q. humilis* populations.\n\nThe biologist decides to apply the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC). For the purpose of this problem, the PSC defines a species as the smallest diagnosable monophyletic group of organisms within which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent.\n\nBased on a strict application of the Phylogenetic Species Concept to the evidence provided, which of the following conclusions is the most appropriate?\n\nA. They should be classified as one species, because the presence of historical gene flow means they are not fully reproductively isolated.\n\nB. They should be classified as two distinct species, because the two populations are reciprocally monophyletic according to the nuclear DNA, which reflects the overall organismal lineage history.\n\nC. They should be classified as one species, because the *Q. humilis* population is not a monophyletic group according to the mitochondrial DNA, and thus the only diagnosable monophyletic group is the one that contains all individuals from both populations.\n\nD. They should be classified as two distinct species, because they occupy different ecological niches (mountains vs. valleys), which is the primary criterion for speciation.", "solution": "The core of this problem is to apply the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC) to a scenario with conflicting genetic signals, a common challenge in modern systematics.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC)**\nThe problem provides a working definition of the PSC: \"a species is the smallest diagnosable monophyletic group of organisms...\". The key operational criterion here is **monophyly**. A monophyletic group, or a clade, is a group consisting of an ancestor and ALL of its descendants. Under the PSC, for a population to be recognized as a distinct species, it must form a monophyletic group that is distinct from all other such groups.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Genetic Evidence**\nThere are two sources of genetic data that give conflicting results (a situation known as gene tree-species tree discordance).\n- **Nuclear DNA:** This represents thousands of genes from across the genome and is generally considered the best indicator of the overall evolutionary history of the organism (the \"species tree\"). The nuclear DNA analysis shows that *Q. altus* is monophyletic and *Q. humilis* is monophyletic. This is a pattern of reciprocal monophyly, which is strong evidence for two separate lineages under the PSC.\n- **Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA):** This represents a single, maternally inherited locus (a \"gene tree\"). The mtDNA analysis shows that *Q. altus* is monophyletic, but *Q. humilis* is **paraphyletic**. This means the *Q. humilis* group does not contain all descendants of its common ancestor; some of its descendants are in the *Q. altus* group (or more accurately, some individuals identified as *Q. humilis* carry mitochondria that phylogenetically belong to the *Q. altus* lineage). This is a classic signature of introgression, where hybridization has occurred and genes from one population have crossed into the other.\n\n**Step 3: Reconcile the Conflicting Data and Apply the PSC**\nThe conflict arises because the species tree (inferred from nuclear DNA) and one of the gene trees (mtDNA) do not match. Biologists must decide which line of evidence is more representative of the species boundary.\n- The mtDNA represents the history of just the mitochondrion. Because it is a single genetic unit, its history can be different from the history of the organism as a whole due to processes like introgression or incomplete lineage sorting.\n- The nuclear DNA, comprising the vast majority of the genome, reflects the history of the population of organisms.\nA pragmatic application of the PSC, even a \"strict\" one, prioritizes the evidence that best reflects the overall \"parental pattern of ancestry and descent\" for the entire organism. The nuclear genome's signal of reciprocal monophyly is the strongest evidence for two distinct, historically isolated lineages that have maintained their integrity despite a limited instance of mitochondrial exchange. The paraphyly of the mtDNA is best interpreted as a historical event (introgression) that has affected a single gene region but has not erased the overall differentiation of the two lineages. Therefore, the most defensible conclusion under the PSC is that there are two species, diagnosed by the monophyly of their nuclear genomes.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Options**\n- **A. They should be classified as one species, because the presence of historical gene flow means they are not fully reproductively isolated.** This invokes the criterion of reproductive isolation, which is the cornerstone of the Biological Species Concept (BSC), not the PSC. The PSC is concerned with historical patterns of ancestry (monophyly), not the current potential for interbreeding. Therefore, this option is incorrect as it misapplies a different species concept.\n- **B. They should be classified as two distinct species, because the two populations are reciprocally monophyletic according to the nuclear DNA, which reflects the overall organismal lineage history.** This option correctly identifies the nuclear DNA as the most robust indicator of the species' lineage history and applies the PSC criterion of monophyly to this data. It correctly interprets the mtDNA signal as a case of gene tree-species tree discordance that does not override the primary pattern. This is the best conclusion.\n- **C. They should be classified as one species, because the *Q. humilis* population is not a monophyletic group according to the mitochondrial DNA, and thus the only diagnosable monophyletic group is the one that contains all individuals from both populations.** This represents an overly literal and brittle interpretation of the \"monophyly\" rule. While it is true that the mtDNA makes *Q. humilis* not diagnosable as monophyletic *based on that single gene*, this ignores the stronger, genome-wide evidence. In systematics, species are hypotheses, and all available evidence must be weighed. The nuclear data provides a much stronger basis for a two-species hypothesis. This option incorrectly prioritizes a single anomalous gene tree over the species tree.\n- **D. They should be classified as two distinct species, because they occupy different ecological niches (mountains vs. valleys), which is the primary criterion for speciation.** This invokes the criterion of ecological distinctiveness, which is the basis of the Ecological Species Concept (ESC). While the ecological information is relevant context, it is not the defining criterion of the PSC. Therefore, this option is incorrect as it applies the wrong species concept.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1954322"}, {"introduction": "Modern species delimitation has moved into a statistical realm, where hypotheses about species boundaries are tested using powerful computational models. This final practice [@problem_id:1954359] challenges you to interpret the results of a multispecies coalescent analysis, a cutting-edge tool in phylogenetics. Here, you will learn how probabilistic evidence for independent evolution informs the application of the PSC and guides the search for the diagnostic characters that formally define a species.", "problem": "A team of ornithologists is studying a bird species, *Acanthis flammea*, which has a very large and continuous geographical distribution. Traditionally, it has been considered a single species. The researchers collect tissue samples from individuals representing three distinct geographic regions: a North American population, a Eurasian population, and a high-Arctic population from Greenland. They sequence several unlinked nuclear gene loci from all samples.\n\nTo test species boundaries, they employ a multispecies coalescent model. This statistical framework compares the likelihood of the observed genetic data under different \"species tree\" hypotheses. The team tests two primary hypotheses:\n1.  H1: All three populations belong to a single panmictic species.\n2.  H2: The three populations represent three distinct, independently evolving species.\n\nThe analysis returns a Bayes factor strongly in favor of H2, with a posterior probability greater than 0.99 for the three-species model. This provides very high statistical support for splitting *Acanthis flammea* into three species.\n\nAccording to the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC), a species is the smallest diagnosable cluster of individual organisms within which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent. A key operational criterion of this definition is \"diagnosable monophyly,\" meaning the group must be monophyletic and distinguishable from all other such groups by unique, fixed character states.\n\nGiven the high statistical support for the three-species model from the coalescent analysis, which of the following statements most accurately describes the implication for applying the Phylogenetic Species Concept to these bird populations?\n\nA. The statistical result is irrelevant to the PSC because coalescent models are probabilistic and the PSC requires absolute, deterministic proof of monophyly based on observed morphological characters.\n\nB. The high probability proves that the three populations are reproductively isolated, thereby satisfying the primary criterion of the PSC.\n\nC. The result implies that the specific DNA sequences from the gene loci used in the analysis now serve as the official diagnostic characters required to define the three species under the PSC.\n\nD. The result provides definitive proof that the three populations are diagnosably monophyletic, and they should be formally named as new species without any further investigation.\n\nE. The result provides strong evidence that the three populations have been evolving independently for a sufficiently long time, making it highly probable that unique, fixed diagnostic characters (which may be genetic, morphological, or behavioral) exist for each group, thus warranting further investigation to identify them.", "solution": "First, interpret the statistical result. A multispecies coalescent analysis compares hypotheses about independently evolving lineages by modeling gene tree variation within and among species due to coalescent processes. A strong Bayes factor favoring H2, with posterior probability greater than 0.99, indicates very strong evidence that the three geographic populations are best modeled as independently evolving lineages rather than a single panmictic unit.\n\nSecond, recall the operative criteria of the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC): a species is the smallest diagnosable cluster of organisms that is monophyletic and distinguishable from other such clusters by unique, fixed character states. The PSC does not require reproductive isolation; rather, it requires diagnosable monophyly and fixed differences. Diagnostic characters can be genetic, morphological, behavioral, or other heritable traits; they need not be morphological only.\n\nThird, relate coalescent evidence to PSC criteria. Strong support for independent lineages implies that the populations have been evolving separately long enough that fixed differences are likely to have accumulated. However, the coalescent result itself does not by itself specify which exact fixed characters diagnose each lineage, nor does it automatically convert the particular sequences analyzed into official diagnostic traits. It instead provides strong evidence that such diagnostic characters likely exist and motivates their identification.\n\nFourth, evaluate the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because PSC does not require absolute, deterministic proof or exclusively morphological evidence; genetic data and probabilistic phylogenetic inference are valid for diagnosing monophyly and fixed differences.\n- Option B is incorrect because reproductive isolation is the core of the Biological Species Concept, not the PSC, and the coalescent result does not prove reproductive isolation.\n- Option C is incorrect because the specific sequences analyzed are not automatically fixed diagnostic characters; coalescent support does not guarantee that those loci alone contain fixed differences across all individuals.\n- Option D is incorrect because high statistical support is not a definitive, standalone proof of diagnosable monophyly under PSC; formal taxonomic action should be supported by identified diagnostic characters.\n- Option E is correct because the coalescent result is strong evidence of independent evolution, making it highly probable that unique, fixed diagnostic characters exist for each lineage, and it justifies further investigation to identify those characters (genetic, morphological, or behavioral) to meet the PSC’s diagnosability criterion.\n\nTherefore, the implication for applying the PSC is best captured by Option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1954359"}]}
