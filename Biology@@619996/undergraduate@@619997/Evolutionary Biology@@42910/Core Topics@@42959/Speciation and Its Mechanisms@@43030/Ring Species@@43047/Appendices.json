This practice illustrates the core mechanism by which genetic gradients, or clines, are established and maintained along the ring.", "problem": "A biologist is studying the population genetics of the desert pocket mouse (*Chaetodipus penicillatus*) in a region where several populations form a ring-like structure around an uninhabitable salt flat. Three adjacent populations are of particular interest: the Northern, Central, and Southern populations.\nA single gene controlling coat color has two alleles, `B` (for dark brown fur) and `b` (for light tan fur). The Northern population, at one end of the chain, is found to be fixed for the `B` allele. The Southern population, at another observed end of the chain, is fixed for the `b` allele.\nThe Central population exists between them and experiences continuous gene flow from its neighbors. Genetic analysis reveals the following migration dynamics each generation:\n- The proportion of the Central population's gene pool derived from migrants from the Northern population is $m_N = 0.025$.\n- The proportion of the Central population's gene pool derived from migrants from the Southern population is $m_S = 0.040$.\nThe remaining fraction of the gene pool, $1 - m_N - m_S$, is from the non-migrating individuals of the Central population.\nInitially, a survey of the Central population found the frequency of the `B` allele to be $p_0 = 0.800$.\nAssuming this model of migration is the only evolutionary force acting on this allele and that the migration rates remain constant, what will be the frequency of the `B` allele in the Central population after 10 generations?\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the frequency of the `B` allele in the Central population after 10 generations of constant migration from the Northern and Southern populations. We can model this process using a recurrence relation for the allele frequency.\n\nLet $p_t$ be the frequency of the `B` allele in the Central population at generation $t$. The gene pool of the next generation, $t+1$, is a mixture of genes from three sources: the non-migrating portion of the Central population, migrants from the North, and migrants from the South. The frequency $p_{t+1}$ is the weighted average of the allele frequencies from these sources.\n\nThe weights are the proportions of the gene pool from each source, which are given as $m_N = 0.025$ for the North, $m_S = 0.040$ for the South, and $(1 - m_N - m_S)$ for the natives of the Central population. The allele frequencies in the source populations are $p_N = 1$ (fixed for `B`) and $p_S = 0$ (since it's fixed for `b`, the frequency of `B` is 0). The frequency in the native Central population at generation $t$ is $p_t$.\n\nThe recurrence relation is therefore:\n$$p_{t+1} = (1 - m_N - m_S) p_t + m_N p_N + m_S p_S$$\nLet's define the total migration rate as $m = m_N + m_S$. The equation becomes:\n$$p_{t+1} = (1 - m) p_t + m_N p_N + m_S p_S$$\nThis is a linear first-order recurrence relation. To find a closed-form solution for $p_t$, it is helpful to first find the equilibrium frequency, $\\hat{p}$, which is the value of $p$ where $p_{t+1} = p_t = \\hat{p}$.\n$$\\hat{p} = (1 - m) \\hat{p} + m_N p_N + m_S p_S$$\n$$\\hat{p} - (1 - m) \\hat{p} = m_N p_N + m_S p_S$$\n$$m \\hat{p} = m_N p_N + m_S p_S$$\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{m_N p_N + m_S p_S}{m} = \\frac{m_N p_N + m_S p_S}{m_N + m_S}$$\nThis equilibrium frequency represents the point to which the system will converge over time. To find the frequency at a specific time $t$, we solve the recurrence relation. Let's analyze the deviation from equilibrium, $d_t = p_t - \\hat{p}$.\n$$p_{t+1} - \\hat{p} = \\left((1-m)p_t + m_N p_N + m_S p_S\\right) - \\hat{p}$$\nSince $m \\hat{p} = m_N p_N + m_S p_S$, we can write $m_N p_N + m_S p_S = m\\hat{p}$.\n$$p_{t+1} - \\hat{p} = (1-m)p_t + m\\hat{p} - \\hat{p} = (1-m)p_t - (1-m)\\hat{p}$$\n$$p_{t+1} - \\hat{p} = (1-m)(p_t - \\hat{p})$$\nThis shows that the deviation $d_{t+1} = (1-m)d_t$. This is a geometric progression. After $t$ generations, the deviation will be $d_t = (1-m)^t d_0$, where $d_0 = p_0 - \\hat{p}$.\nSubstituting back for $p_t$, we get the general solution:\n$$p_t = \\hat{p} + (p_0 - \\hat{p})(1-m)^t$$\nNow we substitute the values from the problem statement:\n- Initial frequency in Central population: $p_0 = 0.800$\n- Frequency in Northern population: $p_N = 1$\n- Frequency in Southern population: $p_S = 0$\n- Migration rate from North: $m_N = 0.025$\n- Migration rate from South: $m_S = 0.040$\n- Number of generations: $t = 10$\n\nFirst, calculate the total migration rate $m$:\n$$m = m_N + m_S = 0.025 + 0.040 = 0.065$$\nNext, calculate the equilibrium frequency $\\hat{p}$:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{m_N p_N + m_S p_S}{m_N + m_S} = \\frac{(0.025)(1) + (0.040)(0)}{0.065} = \\frac{0.025}{0.065} = \\frac{25}{65} = \\frac{5}{13}$$\nNow, use the general solution to find $p_{10}$:\n$$p_{10} = \\hat{p} + (p_0 - \\hat{p})(1-m)^{10}$$\n$$p_{10} = \\frac{5}{13} + \\left(0.800 - \\frac{5}{13}\\right)(1 - 0.065)^{10}$$\n$$p_{10} = \\frac{5}{13} + \\left(\\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{5}{13}\\right)(0.935)^{10}$$\nTo combine the terms in the parenthesis, find a common denominator:\n$$\\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{5}{13} = \\frac{4 \\times 13 - 5 \\times 5}{5 \\times 13} = \\frac{52 - 25}{65} = \\frac{27}{65}$$\nSo, the expression is:\n$$p_{10} = \\frac{5}{13} + \\left(\\frac{27}{65}\\right)(0.935)^{10}$$\nNow we calculate the numerical values:\n$$(0.935)^{10} \\approx 0.51115809$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$p_{10} = \\frac{5}{13} + \\frac{27}{65} (0.51115809)$$\n$$p_{10} \\approx 0.38461538 + (0.41538462)(0.51115809)$$\n$$p_{10} \\approx 0.38461538 + 0.21232717$$\n$$p_{10} \\approx 0.59694255$$\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to three significant figures.
