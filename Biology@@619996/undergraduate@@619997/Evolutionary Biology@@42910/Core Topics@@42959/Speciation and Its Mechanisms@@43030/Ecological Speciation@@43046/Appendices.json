{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Ecological speciation often begins when populations adapt to different environments, and the traits under selection also influence mate choice. To test this, we must move beyond observation to quantify the strength of reproductive isolation. This exercise challenges you to do just that by analyzing data from a mate-choice experiment to calculate an Assortative Mating Index ($AMI$) and interpret its meaning [@problem_id:1920983]. This practice is fundamental for understanding how evolutionary biologists provide quantitative evidence for prezygotic isolation.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying two populations of a fictional lizard, *Petrosaurus edaphicus*. One population inhabits a region with light-colored sandy dunes ('Dune' population), and the other lives on a dark, volcanic rock field ('Lava' population). Individuals from the Dune population exhibit a pale, sandy coloration, while individuals from the Lava population are dark grey. The biologist hypothesizes that divergent natural selection for crypsis (camouflage) in these two environments is incidentally driving the evolution of reproductive isolation between the populations, a process known as ecological speciation.\n\nTo test for the presence of pre-zygotic reproductive isolation, the biologist conducts a series of mate-choice trials. In each trial, a single female is placed in a chamber and presented simultaneously with two size-matched, stimulus males: one from her own population (a 'homopopulation' male) and one from the other population (a 'heteropopulation' male). The female's choice is recorded as the first male she approaches and engages in a species-specific courtship-receptive display with.\n\nThe results of the experiment are as follows:\n- In 100 trials using Dune females, 78 females chose the Dune male and 22 chose the Lava male.\n- In 100 trials using Lava females, 85 females chose the Lava male and 15 chose the Dune male.\n\nTo quantify the strength of mating preference, the biologist uses an Assortative Mating Index (AMI), defined as:\n$$\n\\text{AMI} = \\frac{(\\text{Number of Homopopulation Choices}) - (\\text{Number of Heteropopulation Choices})}{(\\text{Total Number of Choices})}\n$$\nAn AMI of +1 indicates complete assortative mating, 0 indicates random mating, and -1 indicates complete disassortative mating.\n\nBased on the experimental data, calculate the AMI for both the Dune and Lava female populations and select the option that provides the most accurate interpretation of the results in the context of evolutionary biology.\n\nA. The calculated AMI values (0.56 for Dune females, 0.70 for Lava females) indicate strong positive assortative mating in both populations. This supports the hypothesis that ecological speciation is occurring, with reproductive isolation arising as a byproduct of divergent adaptation to different soil backgrounds.\n\nB. The calculated AMI values are approximately zero for both populations, indicating that mating is random with respect to population origin. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the ecological speciation hypothesis.\n\nC. The calculated AMI values are negative for both populations, indicating that females preferentially choose males from the other population (disassortative mating). This pattern actively counteracts speciation.\n\nD. The AMI for Dune females is 0.56 and for Lava females is 0.70. This asymmetry in preference strength is direct evidence for reinforcement, a process where selection strengthens pre-zygotic isolation because of low hybrid fitness.", "solution": "We are given the Assortative Mating Index (AMI) defined by\n$$\n\\text{AMI}=\\frac{(\\text{Number of Homopopulation Choices})-(\\text{Number of Heteropopulation Choices})}{\\text{Total Number of Choices}}.\n$$\nApply this definition to each female population.\n\nFor Dune females: the number of homopopulation choices is $78$, the number of heteropopulation choices is $22$, and the total number of choices is $100$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\text{AMI}_{\\text{Dune}}=\\frac{78-22}{100}=\\frac{56}{100}=\\frac{14}{25}=0.56.\n$$\n\nFor Lava females: the number of homopopulation choices is $85$, the number of heteropopulation choices is $15$, and the total number of choices is $100$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\text{AMI}_{\\text{Lava}}=\\frac{85-15}{100}=\\frac{70}{100}=\\frac{7}{10}=0.70.\n$$\n\nInterpretation: Positive AMI values indicate assortative mating, with larger positive values indicating stronger preference for homopopulation mates. The values $0.56$ and $0.70$ indicate substantial positive assortative mating in both populations, consistent with pre-zygotic isolation and supporting the ecological speciation hypothesis. Asymmetry alone does not constitute direct evidence for reinforcement because reinforcement specifically requires evidence that selection against hybrids increases pre-zygotic isolation; such evidence (e.g., low hybrid fitness and a scenario of ongoing contact) is not provided here.

This exercise explores a key form of postzygotic isolation central to ecological speciation: ecological inviability [@problem_id:1920974]. By contrasting hybrid survival in parental habitats versus a benign, neutral environment, you will learn to distinguish between intrinsic genetic failures and extrinsic, environment-dependent fitness loss, which is a hallmark of ecological speciation.", "problem": "In a mountainous region, two distinct populations of the wildflower *Aquilegia adaptans* exist in close proximity. Population A is found exclusively on serpentine soils, which are characterized by low calcium-to-magnesium ratios and high concentrations of heavy metals, resulting in a low soil pH. Population B thrives on adjacent limestone-derived soils, which are basic (high pH) and rich in calcium. Despite their adaptations to these chemically distinct soils, the two populations are pollinated by the same species of hawkmoth, which frequently travels between the two sites, leading to cross-pollination and the formation of hybrid seeds.\n\nA group of evolutionary biologists conducted an experiment. They collected hybrid seeds resulting from these cross-pollination events. When these hybrid seeds were planted in the native serpentine soil of Population A, they failed to germinate. Similarly, when planted in the native limestone soil of Population B, they also failed to germinate. However, when the same batch of hybrid seeds was planted in a controlled greenhouse environment using a neutral, nutrient-balanced potting mix, a significant portion of the seeds germinated and grew into healthy, fertile adult plants.\n\nThis phenomenon, where hybrid offspring are inviable in the parental environments but are otherwise developmentally healthy, is a specific form of reproductive isolation. Which of the following terms best describes this barrier?\n\nA. Mechanical Isolation\n\nB. Hybrid Breakdown\n\nC. Gametic Isolation\n\nD. Intrinsic Hybrid Inviability\n\nE. Extrinsic Postzygotic Isolation (Ecological Inviability)", "solution": "- Identify the reproductive stage affected: Cross-pollination occurs and hybrid seeds are formed, so prezygotic barriers (such as mechanical or gametic isolation) are not responsible. Therefore, the barrier is postzygotic.\n\n- Differentiate intrinsic versus extrinsic postzygotic isolation:\n  - Intrinsic hybrid inviability implies that hybrids fail due to internal, developmentally based genetic incompatibilities, independent of the environment; such hybrids would be inviable or unhealthy across environments.\n  - Extrinsic postzygotic isolation (ecological inviability) implies that hybrids are developmentally normal but have low fitness due to environmental mismatch; their inviability or low performance depends on the environment.\n\n- Interpret the experimental evidence:\n  - Hybrid seeds fail to germinate in both parental native soils (serpentine and limestone), indicating they cannot cope with those specific edaphic conditions.\n  - The same hybrid seeds germinate and develop into healthy, fertile adults in a neutral, nutrient-balanced greenhouse medium, demonstrating that their developmental program is intact and that their failure in the parental soils is environment-dependent.\n\n- Exclude incorrect options:\n  - A. Mechanical isolation is prezygotic and contradicted by the formation of hybrid seeds.\n  - C. Gametic isolation is prezygotic and contradicted by successful fertilization and seed formation.\n  - B. Hybrid breakdown refers to reduced fitness in F2 or later generations or after backcrossing; here, the effect is in the F1 hybrids at germination in natural soils.\n  - D. Intrinsic hybrid inviability would predict failure irrespective of environment; contradicted by healthy growth in greenhouse conditions.\n\n- Conclude the correct barrier: The pattern matches extrinsic postzygotic isolation, specifically ecological inviability due to maladaptation to parental soil chemistries despite overall developmental health in benign conditions.\n\nTherefore, the best descriptor is Extrinsic Postzygotic Isolation (Ecological Inviability).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1920974"}, {"introduction": "Evolution is a dynamic process where reproductive barriers can be strengthened over time, a process known as reinforcement. This occurs when producing unfit hybrids is costly, leading natural selection to favor individuals that mate exclusively with their own type. This practice introduces reproductive character displacement, the observable outcome where mating signals diverge more in areas of sympatry than in allopatry [@problem_id:1920941]. Understanding this pattern reveals how the interaction between prezygotic and postzygotic isolation can accelerate the speciation process.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying two closely related species of nocturnal tree frogs, the \"Echoing Tree Frog\" and the \"Melody Tree Frog\". In the northern region of a large forest, only the Echoing Tree Frog is found. In the southern region, only the Melody Tree Frog is found. In these allopatric populations, the males' mating calls are very similar, with their dominant frequencies being nearly indistinguishable.\n\nHowever, in a central \"overlap zone\" where both species coexist and breed in the same ponds (sympatry), the biologist observes a distinct pattern. The calls of the Echoing Tree Frog males in this zone are significantly higher in pitch than those in the northern allopatric region. Conversely, the calls of the Melody Tree Frog males in the overlap zone are significantly lower in pitch than those in the southern allopatric region. This divergence in vocalizations reduces the chance of females being attracted to the wrong species, as interspecies mating attempts have been shown to result in sterile offspring.\n\nWhat is the evolutionary term for this pattern, where a trait difference between two species is magnified in the geographic area where they coexist, driven by selection against hybridization?\n\nA) Character Displacement\n\nB) Ecological Niche Partitioning\n\nC) Müllerian Mimicry\n\nD) Ring Species\n\nE) Genetic Drift", "solution": "We first identify the pattern described: in allopatry, the two species have very similar mating call frequencies, but in sympatry (the overlap zone), their call frequencies diverge markedly in opposite directions. This divergence in a mating signal decreases the probability of heterospecific attraction and mating. Because interspecific matings produce sterile offspring, selection in sympatry disfavors hybridization and thus favors traits that increase assortative mating between conspecifics.\n\nThis is the hallmark of reinforcement, which acts specifically on traits that affect mate recognition and mating, producing greater trait divergence in sympatry than in allopatry. Within standard terminology, this sympatry-specific increase in divergence of mating traits is called reproductive character displacement, a subtype of character displacement. Among the provided options, Character Displacement best matches this process, whereas:\n- Ecological Niche Partitioning concerns divergence in resource use, not mating signals.\n- Müllerian Mimicry involves convergence of warning signals among defended species, not divergence.\n- Ring Species describes a geographic pattern of continuous variation with reproductive isolation at the ends, not sympatry-driven divergence.\n- Genetic Drift is random and would not predict consistent, sympatry-specific divergence driven by selection against hybridization.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Character Displacement (specifically, reproductive character displacement via reinforcement).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1920941"}]}
