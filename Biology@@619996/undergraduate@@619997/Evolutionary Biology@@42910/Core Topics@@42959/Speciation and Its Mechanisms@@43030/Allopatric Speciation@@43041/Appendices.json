This exercise presents a hypothetical scenario to test your understanding of this foundational principle. By evaluating several potential factors, you will determine which is the most critical and immediate prerequisite for divergent evolution to begin, reinforcing the central role of isolation in the allopatric model [@problem_id:1907608].", "problem": "A population of field mice, *Peromyscus maniculatus*, inhabits a large, continuous prairie habitat. A major geological event, such as a river capture, causes a large, fast-flowing river to abruptly change its course, carving a new channel directly through the middle of the prairie. This event instantaneously isolates a small sub-population of mice on one side of the new river from the much larger main population on the other side. An evolutionary biologist arrives to study the situation. To determine the long-term likelihood of allopatric speciation occurring between these two groups of mice, which of the following factors would be the most critical and immediate to assess?\n\nA. The rate of new mutations arising in the genomes of the isolated sub-population.\n\nB. The presence of different predator species on either side of the new river.\n\nC. The degree to which the river serves as a barrier to gene flow between the two populations.\n\nD. The genetic diversity and specific allele frequencies of the founding members of the small, isolated sub-population.\n\nE. The difference in the types of food resources, such as seeds and insects, available on each side of the river.", "solution": "We want to evaluate which factor most directly determines the long-term likelihood of allopatric speciation after a new river abruptly splits a continuous population into a large main population and a small isolated sub-population.\n\nAllopatric speciation requires persistent interruption of gene flow plus sufficient time for divergence via drift, selection, and mutation to accumulate. Thus, the immediate determinant is whether the geographic barrier effectively prevents gene flow. Formally, in a simple migration model with migration rate $m$ from the main population into the sub-population, the allele frequency in the sub-population after migration is\n$$\np_{t+1}^{(s)}=(1-m)p_{t}^{(s)}+m\\,p_{t}^{(m)}.\n$$\nDefine the difference in allele frequencies as $D_{t}=p_{t}^{(s)}-p_{t}^{(m)}$. If the main population is large enough that $p_{t}^{(m)}$ is approximately constant over short time scales, then under migration alone,\n$$\nD_{t+1}=(1-m)D_{t},\n$$\nso any initial differences (including those due to founder effects) decay geometrically unless $m$ is approximately zero. Therefore, if the river fails to reduce $m$ to near zero, gene flow will homogenize allele frequencies and impede divergence.\n\nThis conclusion is reinforced by standard results: at migration–drift equilibrium under the island model, genetic differentiation satisfies\n$$\nF_{ST}\\approx \\frac{1}{4N_{e}m+1},\n$$\nso when $4N_{e}m$ is large, differentiation remains small, and when $4N_{e}m \\ll 1$, divergence can accumulate. The critical immediate parameter is $m$, which reflects the barrier’s effectiveness.\n\nNow compare the options:\n- A (mutation rate): Mutation introduces new variation slowly; its immediate rate is generally too low to drive early divergence without isolation. Mutation contributes over long timescales but is not the first determinant of whether speciation can proceed.\n- B (predators) and E (resources): Divergent selection can promote divergence, but its effect is strongly contingent on gene flow. A standard result is that local adaptation is eroded if $m \\gtrsim s$, where $s$ is a selection coefficient; assessing $m$ is prerequisite to judging whether selection can overcome migration.\n- D (founder allele frequencies): Founder effects can produce initial divergence, but as shown above, with nonzero $m$ the difference $D_{t}$ decays as $(1-m)^{t}D_{0}$. Thus, without effective isolation, founder differences will be rapidly eroded.\n- C (barrier to gene flow): This directly measures whether $m$ is near zero. If the river sufficiently prevents dispersal and mating across sides, then drift, selection, and mutation can act independently, allowing divergence and increasing the likelihood of allopatric speciation.\n\nTherefore, the most critical and immediate factor to assess is the degree to which the river prevents gene flow between the two populations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1907608"}, {"introduction": "Once populations are geographically isolated, their evolutionary paths are shaped by the unique selective pressures of their respective environments. This practice problem explores the powerful role of divergent selection using the well-studied example of guppies, where a trade-off exists between natural selection (predation) and sexual selection (mate choice). Analyzing this scenario will help you understand how environmental differences can drive the rapid evolution of distinct traits, a key engine of speciation [@problem_id:1907624].", "problem": "An ecologist initiates a long-term study on rapid evolution in guppies (*Poecilia reticulata*). A large, genetically diverse founder population of guppies is collected from a river. This population exhibits a wide spectrum of coloration in males, from very bright and colorful to drab and camouflaged. These guppies are then divided and used to establish two new, isolated populations in separate, large, artificial ponds, preventing any gene flow between them. The conditions in the two ponds are set as follows:\n\n*   **Pond A:** The water is kept extremely clear. A species of predatory fish, known to prey on guppies, is introduced and maintained at a stable population density.\n*   **Pond B:** The water is kept very murky due to suspended silt and a controlled algal bloom, significantly reducing visibility. No predators are introduced into this pond.\n\nIn both ponds, guppy populations successfully establish and reproduce for many generations. Female guppies in the original source population are known to exhibit a preference for mating with the most brightly colored males. Assuming this female preference is a heritable trait and is maintained in both new populations, and that male coloration is also heritable, which of the following statements describes the most likely evolutionary outcome for the physical appearance of the *male* guppies in the two ponds?\n\nA. Males in both Pond A and Pond B will evolve to be more brightly colored than the ancestral population.\n\nB. Males in Pond A will evolve to be drably colored, while males in Pond B will evolve to be more brightly colored.\n\nC. Males in both Pond A and Pond B will evolve to be more drably colored than the ancestral population.\n\nD. Males in Pond A will evolve to be more brightly colored, while males in Pond B will evolve to be drably colored.\n\nE. The coloration of males in both ponds will not diverge significantly from the ancestral population, as any changes would be primarily due to random genetic drift.", "solution": "We analyze evolutionary change in male coloration as a heritable quantitative trait subject to opposing components of selection: sexual selection via female preference for bright males and natural selection via predation against conspicuous males. Let male coloration brightness be a trait $z$ with additive genetic variance, and let the net directional selection gradient be $\\beta_{\\text{tot}} = \\beta_{\\text{sex}} + \\beta_{\\text{nat}}$, where $\\beta_{\\text{sex}} > 0$ reflects female preference for brighter males and $\\beta_{\\text{nat}}  0$ reflects viability selection against brightness due to predation and detectability. With heritability maintained and no gene flow between ponds, the expected response per generation follows the quantitative genetic principle $\\Delta \\bar{z} \\propto \\beta_{\\text{tot}}$ (e.g., the Lande equation $\\Delta \\bar{z} = G \\beta_{\\text{tot}}$ with genetic variance $G > 0$), so the sign of $\\beta_{\\text{tot}}$ determines the evolutionary direction.\n\nIn Pond A, water is extremely clear and predators that prey on guppies are present at a stable density. Clear water maximizes the detectability of conspicuous males by predators, so the magnitude of viability selection against bright coloration is strong, i.e., $|\\beta_{\\text{nat,A}}|$ is large. Female preference for bright males persists, so $\\beta_{\\text{sex,A}} > 0$. However, under clear water with predators, empirical and theoretical expectations indicate that predation-driven natural selection dominates sexual selection, so $|\\beta_{\\text{nat,A}}| > \\beta_{\\text{sex,A}}$, giving $\\beta_{\\text{tot,A}}  0$ and thus $\\Delta \\bar{z}_{\\text{A}}  0$. Therefore, males in Pond A evolve to be more drably colored.\n\nIn Pond B, the water is very murky and there are no predators. The absence of predators removes the viability cost of conspicuous coloration, so $\\beta_{\\text{nat,B}} \\approx 0$ with respect to predation. Although murkiness reduces overall visibility, the problem specifies that female preference for brightness is heritable and maintained, so sexual selection still favors increased brightness, $\\beta_{\\text{sex,B}} > 0$. With negligible antagonistic viability selection from predation, we have $\\beta_{\\text{tot,B}} = \\beta_{\\text{sex,B}} + 0 > 0$, yielding $\\Delta \\bar{z}_{\\text{B}} > 0$. Therefore, males in Pond B evolve to be more brightly colored.\n\nBecause the populations are isolated, these divergent selection regimes operate independently, producing predictable divergence: drab males in Pond A and brighter males in Pond B. This outcome is consistent with well-documented guppy systems where high predation in clear water favors drab coloration despite female preference, whereas low predation environments allow sexual selection to drive brighter male coloration.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is that males in Pond A evolve to be drably colored while males in Pond B evolve to be more brightly colored.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1907624"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary biologists often use molecular data to test hypotheses about past speciation events and quantify the genetic separation between lineages.
