In their common ancestor, a protein complex essential for embryonic neural development was formed by the interaction of two proteins encoded by gene `LocusA` and gene `LocusB`. The ancestral alleles were `A1` and `B1`, respectively.\n\nOver time, a new allele, `A2`, arose and became fixed in Population 1. Similarly, a new allele, `B2`, arose and became fixed in Population 2. In their respective home populations, the combinations (`A2` with `B1`) and (`A1` with `B2`) are perfectly functional.\n\nResearchers bring individuals from both populations into a laboratory and perform a cross: a female from Population 1 (genotype `A2A2 B1B1`) is mated with a male from Population 2 (genotype `A1A1 B2B2`). The resulting F1 hybrid offspring all have the genotype `A2A1 B2B1`. It is observed that while fertilization is successful and the embryos begin to develop, all of them fail to survive to hatching due to catastrophic failures in the formation of their nervous system.\n\nThis outcome is a direct result of a negative epistatic interaction between the protein products of the `A2` allele and the `B2` allele.

Hybrid breakdown\n\nE. Allopatric speciation", "solution": "We begin by identifying the type of reproductive barrier evidenced by the experimental outcome. The cross between a female from Population 1 (genotype A2A2 B1B1) and a male from Population 2 (genotype A1A1 B2B2) produces F1 hybrids with genotype A2A1 B2B1. The observation states that fertilization occurs and embryogenesis begins, but all F1 embryos fail to survive to hatching due to catastrophic failures in neural development caused by a negative epistatic interaction between the derived alleles A2 and B2.\n\nFirst, we rule out prezygotic barriers. Gametic isolation (Option A) is a prezygotic mechanism where sperm and egg fail to fuse; this is inconsistent with the observation that fertilization is successful and embryos begin development. Therefore, gametic isolation does not apply.\n\nNext, we determine which postzygotic barrier best fits. Hybrid inviability (Option B) refers to hybrids that form zygotes but fail to develop properly or survive to reproductive age. The described failure of F1 embryos to complete development and hatch matches this definition exactly, especially given the explicit mechanistic cause—a Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility arising from negative epistasis between A2 and B2.\n\nWe distinguish this from hybrid sterility (Option C), where hybrids are viable but infertile; this does not apply because the hybrids do not survive to reproductive maturity. We also distinguish this from hybrid breakdown (Option D), which occurs when F1 hybrids are viable and fertile but subsequent generations (F2 or backcrosses) exhibit reduced viability or fertility; again, this does not apply because inviability appears already in the F1 generation.\n\nFinally, although the historical context involves geographically separated populations, which is the classic scenario for allopatric speciation (Option E), the question asks specifically which evolutionary concept is best exemplified by the failure of hybrid embryos to survive due to the negative epistatic interaction. The direct phenomenon observed is a postzygotic reproductive isolating barrier of the hybrid inviability type, not the broader speciation mode.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is hybrid inviability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1955875"}, {"introduction": "Reproductive isolation isn't always caused by intrinsic genetic defects; sometimes, the environment itself acts as the barrier. This exercise [@problem_id:1955917] presents a case of ecological inviability, challenging you to understand how hybrid offspring, though viable in a laboratory, may possess an intermediate phenotype that is fatally mismatched to the specialized environments of both parent species.", "problem": "Two geographically separated populations of frogs, which are considered distinct species, are studied by evolutionary biologists. One species, *Lithobates alticola*, inhabits high-altitude ponds where the water temperature is consistently cool, averaging 10°C. The other species, *Lithobates planus*, lives in low-altitude marshes where the water temperature averages a much warmer 26°C.\n\nIn a laboratory setting, researchers successfully cross-breed individuals from both species. The resulting hybrid tadpoles hatch and develop into healthy froglets, but only when kept in aquatic tanks with a constant temperature of 18°C.\n\nFollow-up experiments are conducted where these laboratory-reared hybrid tadpoles are introduced into the natural habitats of both parent species. In the high-altitude ponds, the hybrid tadpoles' metabolic rates are too low in the 10°C water, they fail to develop, and perish. In the low-altitude marshes, the hybrid tadpoles' metabolic rates are too high in the 26°C water, leading to fatal physiological stress. In neither of the parental environments do the hybrids survive to reproductive age.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following terms best describes the reproductive isolating barrier observed?\n\nA. Hybrid inviability\n\nB. Hybrid sterility\n\nC. Ecological inviability\n\nD. Gametic isolation\n\nE. Hybrid breakdown", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the nature of the barrier from the observations. The hybrids can be produced in the laboratory by cross-breeding the two species, so there is no prezygotic barrier preventing mating or fertilization. The hybrids develop into healthy froglets at an intermediate, controlled temperature (18 degrees Celsius), indicating that the F1 hybrids are intrinsically viable under suitable conditions.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate survival in natural parental environments. When placed in the natural habitats of either parent species, the hybrids die before reaching reproductive age due to mismatched metabolic performance at the parental habitat temperatures: too low at high altitude (10 degrees Celsius) and too high at low altitude (26 degrees Celsius). Thus, the hybrids fail to survive in the ecological contexts of the parent species.\n\nStep 3: Match observations to definitions of isolating barriers.\n- Hybrid inviability (Option A) refers to intrinsic developmental failure or inability to survive to reproductive age due to genetic incompatibilities, generally independent of environment. This does not fit because the hybrids are viable under laboratory conditions.\n- Hybrid sterility (Option B) refers to hybrids reaching maturity but being unable to produce offspring. This is not supported; the hybrids do not survive to reproductive age in nature, and no sterility is demonstrated.\n- Ecological inviability (Option C) refers to hybrids that may be intrinsically viable but cannot survive in the ecological conditions of the parental environments due to mismatched adaptations. This matches the observations: hybrids survive in the lab but fail in both parental habitats due to temperature-driven metabolic mismatch.\n- Gametic isolation (Option D) is a prezygotic barrier where gametes fail to fuse; not applicable because hybrids were successfully produced.\n- Hybrid breakdown (Option E) refers to reduced fitness in the F2 or later generations; not applicable because the issue occurs in the F1 in natural environments.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the best-fitting barrier. The correct classification is ecological inviability, as the hybrids are viable in a benign, intermediate environment but fail ecologically in both natural parental habitats.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1955917"}, {"introduction": "The fitness of hybrids can decline over generations, a phenomenon known as hybrid breakdown. This advanced problem [@problem_id:1955889] moves beyond the F1 generation to explore how genetic segregation in F2 offspring can uncover latent incompatibilities, in this case involving genes subject to genomic imprinting. Your task is to calculate the expected viability in the F2 generation, providing a quantitative look at this subtle but potent isolating mechanism.", "problem": "In an investigation into postzygotic reproductive isolation, evolutionary biologists study two distinct, non-endangered rodent species: *Mus A* (a monogamous species) and *Mus B* (a polygynous species). The viability of their offspring is governed by the interaction between two unlinked genetic loci that are subject to genomic imprinting.\n\nThe first locus, `Sc` (Suckling control), is paternally expressed, meaning only the allele inherited from the father is active. It has two alleles: `Sc_A` from *Mus A*, which results in a standard suckling intensity, and `Sc_B` from *Mus B*, which results in a vigorous suckling intensity.\n\nThe second locus, `Wt` (Weaning timer), is maternally expressed, meaning only the allele inherited from the mother is active. It has two alleles: `Wt_A` from *Mus A*, programming the pup for a later weaning time, and `Wt_B` from *Mus B*, programming the pup for an earlier weaning time.\n\nPurebred individuals of both species are homozygous at both loci (i.e., *Mus A* is `Sc_A/Sc_A`, `Wt_A/Wt_A` and *Mus B* is `Sc_B/Sc_B`, `Wt_B/Wt_B`). A pup's viability is determined by the combination of its two expressed alleles. The co-adapted combinations found in the pure species, `(Sc_A, Wt_A)` and `(Sc_B, Wt_B)`, are both fully viable. The mismatched combination of vigorous suckling with a late weaning program, `(Sc_B, Wt_A)`, results in healthy, oversized but fully viable and fertile offspring. However, the combination of standard suckling with an early weaning program, `(Sc_A, Wt_B)`, leads to insufficient nutrient intake and is 100% lethal before sexual maturity.\n\nA successful F1 generation is produced by crossing a male from the *Mus B* species with a female from the *Mus A* species. These F1 individuals are then allowed to interbreed freely to produce an F2 generation. Assuming Mendelian inheritance for both loci, calculate the expected proportion of viable offspring in this F2 generation. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Because of genomic imprinting, only the paternal allele at the $Sc$ locus and only the maternal allele at the $Wt$ locus are expressed in each pup. Viability depends solely on the ordered pair of expressed alleles $(\\text{paternal } Sc,\\ \\text{maternal } Wt)$. The viable combinations are $(Sc_{A}, Wt_{A})$, $(Sc_{B}, Wt_{B})$, and $(Sc_{B}, Wt_{A})$, while $(Sc_{A}, Wt_{B})$ is lethal.\n\nThe initial cross is male Mus B $(Sc_{B}/Sc_{B},\\ Wt_{B}/Wt_{B})$ by female Mus A $(Sc_{A}/Sc_{A},\\ Wt_{A}/Wt_{A})$. Each F1 is $(Sc_{B}/Sc_{A},\\ Wt_{B}/Wt_{A})$ and is viable because its expressed alleles are $(Sc_{B}, Wt_{A})$.\n\nF1 individuals interbreed.
