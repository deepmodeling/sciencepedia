{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding speciation by polyploidy begins with the basics of chromosome counting. Autopolyploidy, the doubling of chromosome sets from a single species, is a dramatic evolutionary event that can lead to instantaneous reproductive isolation. This first practice exercise provides a foundational check on your understanding of how to determine the chromosome number of a newly formed autotetraploid species based on its diploid ancestor [@problem_id:1965207].", "problem": "A field biologist is studying a newly discovered species of wild grass, which she names *Gramineae initialis*. Cytological analysis of its somatic cells reveals that it is a diploid organism with a total chromosome number of 22. In a nearby, geographically isolated meadow, she discovers a second, morphologically distinct but clearly related grass species, which she names *Gramineae robusta*. Genetic evidence strongly suggests that *G. robusta* originated from *G. initialis* through a single evolutionary event of autopolyploidy, resulting in a stable, reproductively isolated autotetraploid lineage.\n\nWhat is the total chromosome number in a somatic cell of *Gramineae robusta*?", "solution": "In cytogenetics, the somatic chromosome number of a diploid organism is denoted by $2n$, where $n$ is the haploid (gametic) number. For Gramineae initialis, the given somatic count is $2n=22$, which implies\n$$n=\\frac{2n}{2}=\\frac{22}{2}=11.$$\nLet $x$ denote the basic chromosome set. For a typical diploid, $x=n$, so here\n$$x=n=11.$$\nAutopolyploidy involves multiplication of entire chromosome sets from a single species. An autotetraploid has four copies of the basic set, so its somatic chromosome number is\n$$4x.$$\nSubstituting $x=11$ gives\n$$4x=4\\times 11=44.$$\nTherefore, a somatic cell of Gramineae robusta (an autotetraploid derived from the diploid ancestor) contains 44 chromosomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{44}$$", "id": "1965207"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple chromosome numbers, the evolutionary success of a polyploid organism depends on its ability to produce viable gametes. This exercise delves into the genetic consequences of autopolyploidy, exploring how homologous chromosomes segregate during meiosis in a tetraploid individual.

Genetic analysis reveals that this species arose through autopolyploidy from a diploid ancestor and is now a stable autotetraploid.

During meiosis under random chromosomal segregation with bivalent pairing, each gamete receives exactly two of the four homologs at the locus, so gametes are diploid for this gene.\n\nThe genotype $BBbb$ means that among the four homologs at this locus there are two copies carrying allele $B$ and two copies carrying allele $b$. Therefore, the allele content of a gamete is obtained by drawing two alleles without replacement from the multiset $\\{B,B,b,b\\}$.\n\nEnumerating all unordered two-allele combinations:\n- Two $B$ alleles: genotype $BB$.

This practice simulates a real-world laboratory scenario using a powerful technique called Genomic In Situ Hybridization (GISH), which acts like a \"chromosome paint.\" You will step into the role of a molecular evolutionary biologist, interpreting fluorescent chromosome data to deduce the precise evolutionary origin of a polyploid plant species [@problem_id:1965248].", "problem": "A team of botanists discovered a new species of perennial grass, which they named *Aegilops nova*, in a high-altitude meadow. Cytological analysis revealed that this species is tetraploid with a chromosome number of $2n = 28$. In the same habitat, two diploid grass species are prevalent: *Aegilops primis* ($2n = 14$) and *Aegilops secundus* ($2n = 14$). To investigate the evolutionary origin of *A. nova*, the researchers performed a Genomic In Situ Hybridization (GISH) experiment. They prepared two different genomic DNA probes. Total genomic DNA from *A. primis* was labeled with a green fluorescent dye to create a \"green probe\". Total genomic DNA from *A. secundus* was labeled with a red fluorescent dye to create a \"red probe\". These two probes were then applied to a chromosome spread prepared from a root tip cell of *A. nova* during metaphase.\n\nUpon examination with a fluorescence microscope, the researchers observed that of the 28 chromosomes present in the *A. nova* cell, 14 chromosomes exhibited strong, uniform green fluorescence, while the other 14 chromosomes exhibited strong, uniform red fluorescence. No chromosomes showed a mix of red and green signals, apart from negligible background fluorescence.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most plausible evolutionary origin of *Aegilops nova*?\n\nA. *A. nova* is an autotetraploid that arose from a spontaneous genome duplication event within an ancestral population of *A. primis*.\n\nB. *A. nova* is an allotetraploid that resulted from a hybridization event between *A. primis* and *A. secundus*, which was followed by a whole-genome duplication event.\n\nC. *A. nova* arose from a direct hybridization event between *A. primis* and *A. secundus* and exists as a sterile F1 hybrid.\n\nD. *A. nova* is an autotetraploid that arose from a spontaneous genome duplication event within an ancestral population of *A. secundus*.\n\nE. The GISH results are ambiguous and cannot be used to distinguish between an autopolyploid or allopolyploid origin for *A. nova*.", "solution": "We are given that the new species, Aegilops nova, is tetraploid with $2n=28$, while two co-occurring diploid species, Aegilops primis and Aegilops secundus, each have $2n=14$. In a GISH experiment using total genomic DNA probes, DNA from A. primis (green) and A. secundus (red) were hybridized to metaphase chromosomes of A. nova. The observation was that exactly 14 chromosomes fluoresced strongly and uniformly green and the other 14 fluoresced strongly and uniformly red, with no mixed signals except negligible background.\n\nBy the principle of genomic in situ hybridization, a labeled genomic DNA probe hybridizes preferentially to chromosomes (or chromosomal regions) derived from a genome with high sequence similarity, producing strong, uniform fluorescence on chromosomes of the same genomic origin. When two probes from different species are used simultaneously, each chromosomal set derived from each species should be labeled by its corresponding probe if the species is an allopolyploid composed of two differentiated subgenomes. Conversely, an autotetraploid derived from a single species would show uniform labeling by the probe from that species across all chromosomes, and little to no specific labeling by the probe from an unrelated species, aside from background.\n\nThe observed pattern—14 green-labeled chromosomes and 14 red-labeled chromosomes, with no mixed labeling on the same chromosome—indicates that A. nova carries two complete chromosome sets, one derived from A. primis and one derived from A. secundus. This is diagnostic of an allotetraploid origin with two distinct subgenomes.\n\nChromosome-number logic supports this interpretation. Each diploid parent has $2n=14$, so their gametes are $n=7$. A direct F1 hybrid between them would be $2n=14$ with $n=7$ from each parent and would ordinarily be sterile due to lack of homologous pairing. The observed $2n=28$ in A. nova is consistent with a whole-genome duplication of such a hybrid, yielding an allotetraploid with two homologous copies of each parental genome (often denoted as $AABB$), restoring pairing and fertility and yielding exactly two sets of 14 chromosomes, one from each species.\n\nThis result rules out the alternatives:\n- Autotetraploidy from A. primis (option A) would produce 28 chromosomes that all hybridize strongly with the green probe, not a 14 green/14 red split.\n- Autotetraploidy from A. secundus (option D) would produce 28 chromosomes that all hybridize strongly with the red probe, not a 14 green/14 red split.\n- A direct sterile F1 hybrid (option C) would have $2n=14$ (7 chromosomes labeled by each probe), not $2n=28$ with 14 labeled by each probe.\n- The clean, non-overlapping labeling is not ambiguous (option E); it is the classic GISH signature of an allopolyploid with two distinct parental subgenomes.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible evolutionary origin is that A. nova is an allotetraploid formed by hybridization between A. primis and A. secundus followed by whole-genome duplication.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1965248"}]}
