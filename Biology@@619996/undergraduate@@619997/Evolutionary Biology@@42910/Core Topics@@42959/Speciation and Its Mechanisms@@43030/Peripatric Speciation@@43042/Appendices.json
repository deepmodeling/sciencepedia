While many situations involve geographic isolation (allopatry), it is crucial to distinguish between large-scale fragmentation (vicariance) and the budding off of a small peripheral isolate. This first practice problem [@problem_id:1953026] challenges you to apply these precise definitions to a classic case, focusing on the defining characteristics of peripatric speciation.", "problem": "A large, continuous population of a hypothetical amphibian species, the Ridgeback Salamander, occupies a wide, low-lying river valley. A major geological event causes the main river to dramatically alter its course, carving a new, impassable channel through the center of the salamanders' habitat. This event creates two reproductively isolated populations. One population, now located west of the new river, is large, comprising thousands of individuals and retaining most of the ancestral population's genetic diversity. The other population, now trapped in a newly formed, small oxbow lake east of the new river, is very small, consisting of fewer than one hundred individuals. Over many generations, the two populations are observed to diverge genetically.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes a specific mode of speciation that is likely occurring?\n\nA. The large western population is undergoing peripatric speciation.\n\nB. Both populations are undergoing sympatric speciation.\n\nC. The small oxbow lake population is undergoing peripatric speciation.\n\nD. The small oxbow lake population is undergoing parapatric speciation.\n\nE. Both populations are undergoing an identical mode of allopatric speciation, and no more specific term applies.", "solution": "First, recall definitions of speciation modes:\n- Allopatric speciation occurs when a physical barrier divides a population, eliminating gene flow; it includes two common scenarios:\n  - Vicariant allopatry: a geographic barrier splits a population into two sizable subpopulations.\n  - Peripatric speciation: a small, isolated founder population becomes separated at the periphery of the original range, with strong effects of genetic drift and founder events.\n- Parapatric speciation involves adjacent populations with limited gene flow and a selection gradient across a cline, not a complete barrier.\n- Sympatric speciation occurs without geographic separation; populations remain in the same area with ongoing potential contact.\n\nApply these to the scenario:\n- A new, impassable river divides a continuous population into two reproductively isolated groups. This is allopatric speciation.\n- One group is large (thousands) and retains most ancestral diversity; the other is very small (fewer than one hundred) and is isolated in a small oxbow lake.\n- The small size of the eastern oxbow population implies strong genetic drift and founder effects, which is characteristic of peripatric speciation.\n- The large western population does not fit peripatric criteria because it is not a small founder isolate; it is the majority remnant of the ancestral population.\n- The presence of an impassable barrier rules out both sympatric and parapatric speciation (no shared habitat and no clinal contact zone).\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A is incorrect: the large western population is not peripatric.\n- B is incorrect: sympatric speciation is inconsistent with an impassable barrier.\n- C is correct: the small oxbow lake population fits peripatric speciation.\n- D is incorrect: parapatric speciation requires adjacent populations with some gene flow, which is absent.\n- E is incorrect: although both are allopatric, a more specific term applies to the small isolated population (peripatric), so they are not undergoing identical modes.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the small oxbow lake population is undergoing peripatric speciation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1953026"}, {"introduction": "Peripatric speciation begins with a founder event, a process that has profound and immediate consequences for the newly founded isolate due to genetic drift. But what is the reciprocal impact on the large, stable ancestral population? This exercise [@problem_id:1953011] challenges you to analyze the complete picture of the founding event, applying core principles of population genetics to determine why the evolutionary trajectory of the source population is largely unaffected.", "problem": "Peripatric speciation is a mode of speciation in which a new species is formed from an isolated peripheral population. Consider a large, stable mainland population of a particular species of flightless beetle, comprising several million individuals with a high degree of genetic diversity. A severe storm washes a small raft of vegetation out to sea, carrying with it a few dozen of these beetles. The raft eventually lands on a small, remote island, where the beetles establish a new, isolated population. This founding event is the first step in a potential peripatric speciation process.\n\nAssuming no further contact between the mainland and the newly established island population, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary evolutionary consequence for the large, stable **mainland source population** as a direct result of this emigration event?\n\nA. The mainland population will experience a significant, measurable loss of overall genetic diversity because a unique combination of alleles has been permanently removed.\n\nB. The mainland population will undergo a rapid adaptive radiation to fill the ecological niche space vacated by the emigrant beetles.\n\nC. The mainland population's gene pool will be significantly altered due to a population bottleneck, leading to a rapid shift in allele frequencies.\n\nD. The mainland population will experience negligible evolutionary impact, as the allele frequencies of its gene pool will not be significantly altered by the loss of a very small number of individuals.\n\nE. The mainland population's rate of mutation will increase to compensate for the loss of individuals and maintain population stability.", "solution": "Let the mainland population size be $N$, with $N$ on the order of several million, and let the number of emigrants be $k$, with $k$ on the order of a few dozen, so $k \\ll N$. Consider any biallelic locus with allele frequency $p$ in the mainland before emigration, so the number of copies of the focal allele in the diploid gene pool is $2Np$.\n\nAssume emigrants are not systematically biased with respect to genotype; under this standard null model, emigrants constitute a random sample from the mainland. The expected number of copies of the focal allele among the $k$ emigrants is $2kp$, so the expected number of copies remaining on the mainland after emigration is $2Np - 2kp = 2p(N - k)$. The post-emigration mainland population size is $N - k$, so the expected allele frequency on the mainland after the event is\n$$\n\\frac{2p(N - k)}{2(N - k)} = p,\n$$\nshowing that the expected allele frequency is unchanged. Stochastic sampling can induce a small deviation; for hypergeometric sampling the fluctuation magnitude scales on the order of $k/N$, which is negligible when $k \\ll N$. Consequently, heterozygosity $H = 2p(1 - p)$ is also unchanged in expectation. Thus, the direct evolutionary impact on the mainland gene pool from losing a few dozen individuals out of several million is negligible.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because losing a very small number of individuals does not cause a significant, measurable loss of overall genetic diversity in a very large population; the specific multilocus combinations borne by those individuals are not a meaningful fraction of the total gene pool.\n- B is incorrect because there is no vacated ecological niche on the mainland created by the departure of a few dozen individuals from a population of several million; adaptive radiation is driven by ecological opportunity and is not triggered by such a minor loss.\n- C is incorrect because a population bottleneck requires a drastic reduction in population size; removing a few dozen from millions does not qualify and will not cause a rapid shift in allele frequencies.\n- D is correct: the allele frequencies and genetic diversity of the large mainland source population are not significantly altered by the loss of a very small number of individuals; the evolutionary impact is negligible.\n- E is incorrect because mutation rates are not homeostatically increased by loss of individuals; they arise from molecular processes and do not adjust to maintain population stability.\n\nTherefore, the primary evolutionary consequence for the large, stable mainland source population is negligible change in allele frequencies and genetic diversity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1953011"}, {"introduction": "Geographic isolation initiates the process of divergence, but it does not guarantee the formation of a new species. For speciation to be considered complete, reproductive barriers must evolve that prevent gene flow upon potential secondary contact. This final thought experiment [@problem_id:1953073] explores what happens when this condition is not met, asking you to predict the outcome when a recently diverged isolate is reunited with its large ancestral population. Your analysis will highlight the power of gene flow to homogenize populations and effectively reverse the initial steps of speciation.", "problem": "A large, genetically diverse population of a particular species of flightless beetle inhabits a vast, continuous temperate forest. Due to a sudden and massive landslide, a small peripheral group of 50 beetles becomes geographically isolated in a secluded valley. This new, isolated population is cut off from the main ancestral population, preventing any gene flow between them. The environment in the valley is nearly identical to the main forest, so there are no strong new selective pressures on the isolated group.\n\nAfter a period of 100 generations, a brief but intense period of geological activity causes the land bridge to the valley to be restored, allowing the now-differentiated peripheral population to come back into secondary contact with the much larger ancestral population. Assume the following:\n1. The ancestral population size has remained large and stable.\n2. The individuals from the two populations are still capable of mating and producing viable, fertile offspring.\n3. The only significant evolutionary force acting to differentiate the isolated population was genetic drift.\n4. The 100-generation separation is considered a very short time on an evolutionary scale for this species.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most likely long-term evolutionary outcome for the peripheral population's distinct gene pool upon re-establishing contact with the ancestral population?\n\nA. The two populations will hybridize extensively, and their gene pools will merge back into one, effectively erasing the divergence that occurred in isolation.\n\nB. The two populations will evolve stronger pre-zygotic isolating mechanisms, leading to the completion of speciation, because any hybrid offspring are slightly less fit.\n\nC. A stable, narrow hybrid zone will form where the two populations meet, with limited gene flow occurring between them.\n\nD. The individuals from the ancestral population will outcompete the individuals from the peripheral population, driving the latter to extinction.\n\nE. The peripheral population will be immediately recognized as a new species by the ancestral population, and no interbreeding will occur.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the evolutionary forces and constraints described. The isolated population was small, with census size $N \\approx 50$, and the only significant differentiating force during isolation was genetic drift. The ancestral population remained large and experienced no significant drift-induced shifts (by assumption of large, stable size). The environment remained similar, and individuals from both populations can interbreed to produce viable, fertile offspring, indicating no post-zygotic isolation and no strong pre-zygotic barriers.\n\nPrinciple 1: Genetic drift causes random changes in allele frequencies with a magnitude that scales inversely with effective population size. The per-generation variance in allele frequency change under drift scales as $\\operatorname{Var}(\\Delta p) \\propto \\frac{p(1-p)}{2N_{e}}$, so a small isolated population (with $N_{e}$ on the order of the census size $N$) can accumulate some random divergence. However, the separation time is only $100$ generations, which is short on the evolutionary timescale for a species with large ancestral populations; thus, the magnitude of divergence is expected to be modest and primarily neutral.\n\nPrinciple 2: Upon secondary contact with no reproductive isolation and with viable, fertile offspring, gene flow acts to homogenize allele frequencies between populations. This is captured by the standard migration model. Let $p_{I}(t)$ be the allele frequency in the isolated population at generation $t$ after secondary contact, and $p_{A}$ the allele frequency in the ancestral population (assumed approximately constant due to its very large size). If $m$ is the proportion of genes in the isolated population each generation that derive from migrants from the ancestral population, then the recursion is\n$$\np_{I}(t+1) = (1 - m)\\,p_{I}(t) + m\\,p_{A}.\n$$\nThis implies the difference from the ancestral frequency decays geometrically:\n$$\np_{I}(t) - p_{A} = (1 - m)^{t}\\,\\big(p_{I}(0) - p_{A}\\big),\n$$\nso $p_{I}(t) \\to p_{A}$ as $t \\to \\infty$, with the rate of convergence governed by $m$. Because the ancestral population is very large relative to the peripheral population, the effective $m$ into the peripheral population is nontrivial, while the reverse flow into the large ancestral population produces negligible change in $p_{A}$. Therefore, gene flow will rapidly swamp drift-induced differences in the small population, merging its gene pool back toward the ancestral state.\n\nPrinciple 3: A stable hybrid zone requires a balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids or ecologically based spatially varying selection. Here, assumptions include no strong new selective pressures and no reduction in hybrid fitness (individuals are viable and fertile), so there is no selection maintaining a cline; thus, a stable, narrow hybrid zone is not expected.\n\nPrinciple 4: Reinforcement (evolution of stronger pre-zygotic isolation) requires selection against hybrids. Given viable, fertile hybrids and no stated reduction in hybrid fitness, reinforcement is not favored, especially over a short timescale. Moreover, the divergence arose via drift rather than divergent selection, further reducing the likelihood of reinforcement.\n\nPrinciple 5: Competitive exclusion driving the peripheral population to extinction would require consistent fitness disadvantages or ecological inferiority. With similar environments and drift-driven differences presumed mostly neutral, there is no basis for systematic outcompetition; instead, the primary effect is genetic swamping via gene flow.\n\nSynthesizing these principles, the most likely long-term outcome is extensive interbreeding with the large ancestral population, leading to homogenization and effective erasure of the drift-induced divergence. This corresponds to option A. Alternatives B, C, D, and E are inconsistent with the assumptions: B requires selection against hybrids; C requires a balance of dispersal and selection; D requires a fitness disadvantage; E contradicts the given interbreeding capability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1953073"}]}
