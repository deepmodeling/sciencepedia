This process is not random; it requires a specific set of conditions acting in concert. This exercise invites you to think like a theoretical biologist, adjusting the parameters of a computer simulation to discover the most effective recipe for sympatric speciation, revealing the crucial interplay between ecological selection and mating behavior. [@problem_id:1967466]", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is running a computer simulation to study the mechanisms of speciation. The simulation models a large population of virtual insects that inhabit a forest containing two distinct types of trees: those with white bark and those with black bark, intermingled in the same geographic area.\n\nThe insects' body color is determined by a single genetic locus with two co-dominant alleles, $C_W$ (for white) and $C_B$ (for black). The resulting genotypes and phenotypes are as follows:\n- $C_W C_W$: White body color\n- $C_B C_B$: Black body color\n- $C_W C_B$: Grey body color\n\nIn the simulation, predatory birds hunt these insects. The birds' hunting success depends on the insects' camouflage. White insects are very well-hidden on white-barked trees but are highly visible on black-barked trees. Conversely, black insects are well-hidden on black-barked trees but highly visible on white-barked trees. Grey insects are moderately visible and easily hunted on both types of trees.\n\nThe simulation also allows for different mating behaviors. This can be set to be completely random (panmixia), or it can incorporate varying degrees of mate choice based on phenotype.\n\nThe team's goal is to adjust the simulation's parameters to most strongly promote sympatric speciation, where the single ancestral population diverges into two distinct, reproductively isolated species (one specializing on white trees, the other on black trees) without any geographic separation.\n\nWhich of the following sets of conditions would most effectively and rapidly lead to sympatric speciation in this virtual population?\n\nA. Strong disruptive selection (i.e., very high predation on grey insects) and strong positive assortative mating (i.e., individuals strongly prefer to mate with others of the same color).\n\nB. Strong stabilizing selection (i.e., very high predation on black and white insects) and random mating.\n\nC. Weak disruptive selection (i.e., slightly higher predation on grey insects) and random mating.\n\nD. Strong disruptive selection (i.e., very high predation on grey insects) and strong negative assortative mating (i.e., individuals strongly prefer to mate with others of a different color).\n\nE. No selection (i.e., predation is random and not dependent on color) and strong positive assortative mating.", "solution": "We identify the conditions that most strongly promote sympatric speciation: coexistence of (i) disruptive selection on an ecologically relevant trait and (ii) positive assortative mating on that same trait, which together reduce gene flow and generate reproductive isolation. In this simulation, body color affects both survival (via predation) and mate choice, so it functions as a “magic trait,” coupling ecology and mating.\n\nLet the fitnesses of the three phenotypes be denoted by $w_{W}$ for white ($C_{W}C_{W}$), $w_{B}$ for black ($C_{B}C_{B}$), and $w_{G}$ for grey ($C_{W}C_{B}$). Disruptive selection corresponds to the regime\n$$\nw_{W} \\approx w_{B} \\gg w_{G},\n$$\ni.e., strong heterozygote disadvantage relative to both homozygotes. Stabilizing selection corresponds to\n$$\nw_{G} \\gg \\max\\{w_{W},w_{B}\\}.\n$$\nNo selection corresponds to\n$$\nw_{W} = w_{B} = w_{G}.\n$$\nLet the strength of positive assortative mating by phenotype be represented by a parameter $r \\in [0,1]$, where $r=0$ is random mating and $r \\to 1$ indicates very strong preference to mate with the same phenotype. Negative assortative mating can be represented analogously by a preference parameter that increases mating between different phenotypes, which increases heterozygosity.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\nA. Strong disruptive selection and strong positive assortative mating. Here $w_{W} \\approx w_{B} \\gg w_{G}$ and $r \\to 1$. Strong disruptive selection creates selection against hybrids (grey), and strong positive assortative mating reduces the production of heterozygotes by preferentially pairing like with like. Because color is both under selection and used in mate choice, this coupling builds linkage disequilibrium between ecology and mating, splitting the population into two ecotypes that are reproductively isolated. This combination is the canonical recipe for rapid sympatric speciation.\n\nB. Strong stabilizing selection and random mating. With $w_{G} \\gg \\max\\{w_{W},w_{B}\\}$ and $r=0$, the grey heterozygote is favored, and random mating maintains high heterozygosity. This drives the population toward a single, central phenotype and opposes divergence; speciation is not promoted.\n\nC. Weak disruptive selection and random mating. With $w_{W} \\gtrsim w_{G} \\lesssim w_{B}$ but small differences and $r=0$, selection is too weak and gene flow unimpeded; recombination constantly recreates heterozygotes. Divergence is slow or absent; speciation is not effectively promoted.\n\nD. Strong disruptive selection and strong negative assortative mating. Although $w_{W} \\approx w_{B} \\gg w_{G}$ selects against heterozygotes, strong negative assortative mating actively increases heterozygote production. These forces oppose each other, maintaining mixing and preventing reproductive isolation; speciation is impeded.\n\nE. No selection and strong positive assortative mating. With $w_{W} = w_{B} = w_{G}$ and $r \\to 1$, assortative mating alone can increase prezygotic isolation somewhat, but in the absence of ecological selection there is no selection against hybrids and no ecological divergence to stabilize separate clusters. This is neither the most effective nor the most rapid route to sympatric speciation compared to case A.\n\nTherefore, the condition that most effectively and rapidly leads to sympatric speciation is strong disruptive selection coupled with strong positive assortative mating.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1967466"}, {"introduction": "Disruptive selection is a powerful engine for divergence, but its effects can be precisely quantified using the tools of population genetics. This practice challenges you to apply these tools to a hypothetical cichlid population where intermediate individuals are at a disadvantage—a classic scenario for sympatric speciation.

This trait is controlled by a single genetic locus with two co-dominant alleles, $A_1$ and $A_2$. The genotype $A_1A_1$ results in a \"benthic\" morph, highly adapted for scraping algae from rocks. The genotype $A_2A_2$ results in a \"limnetic\" morph, adapted for catching zooplankton in the open water column.

This final practice places you in the role of a field biologist who has discovered two sister species living exclusively on the same host plant. Your task is to use the principle of parsimony—the idea that the simplest explanation is often the best—to build a robust argument for why this scenario strongly supports sympatric speciation over other evolutionary pathways. [@problem_id:1967533]", "problem": "An evolutionary biology research team is studying two insect species, *Herbilusus eclecta* and *Herbilusus affinis*, which are specialist herbivores. Phylogenetic analysis using molecular data has robustly confirmed that they are sister species, meaning they are each other's closest living relatives. Extensive field surveys reveal that the geographical ranges of the two species completely overlap. Furthermore, both species are found living and reproducing exclusively on the same host plant, the rare perennial *Argenta singularis*, and are found nowhere else. The two insect species are reproductively isolated from one another primarily by differences in their species-specific mating pheromones.\n\nThis scenario is frequently presented as strong evidence for sympatric speciation. Which of the following statements provides the most robust scientific justification for why this specific set of observations supports a sympatric speciation model over an allopatric speciation model that is followed by secondary contact?\n\nA. The allopatric model would require a more complex and less parsimonious series of events: the ancestral population was geographically split, diverged into two species in isolation, the geographic barrier was removed, and then both species independently converged on or retained an exclusive specialization for the exact same host plant upon becoming sympatric again.\n\nB. The absence of any current geographic barrier separating the two species' ranges provides direct and conclusive evidence that a barrier could not have played a role at any point in their evolutionary history.\n\nC. The fact that they are sister species implies they diverged from a common ancestor very recently, leaving insufficient time for a complete cycle of geographic separation (allopatry), speciation, and subsequent range expansion (secondary contact) to occur.\n\nD. The evolution of different mating pheromones is a form of pre-zygotic reproductive isolation that can only arise when populations are in contact, as is the case in sympatry; such isolation does not evolve between geographically separated populations.\n\nE. The complete overlap in their geographic range and use of the same host plant demonstrates that there is no significant ecological competition between the two species, a condition that is known to be required for sympatric speciation to be successful.", "solution": "The question asks for the strongest justification for favoring a sympatric speciation model over an allopatric one, given the evidence of two sister species living exclusively on the same host plant in complete sympatry. To answer this, we must evaluate the plausibility of each scenario in light of the available evidence, primarily using the principle of parsimony (Ockham's Razor), which suggests that the simplest explanation requiring the fewest assumptions is the most likely.\n\nLet's break down the two main hypotheses:\n\n1.  **Sympatric Speciation Hypothesis**: An ancestral population of insects was living on the host plant *Argenta singularis*. Within this single, co-located population, a reproductive barrier began to form. This could be due to a disruptive selection pressure, for example, if individuals began to specialize in mating at different times of day or on different parts of the plant, leading to reduced gene flow between the emerging groups. Over time, this reproductive isolation became complete (e.g., through the evolution of distinct pheromones), resulting in two distinct species. In this model, the shared, exclusive host preference is the ancestral condition, which is simply inherited by both descendant species. This is a relatively straightforward sequence of events occurring in one location.\n\n2.  **Allopatric Speciation with Secondary Contact Hypothesis**: An ancestral population, originally living on *Argenta singularis*, was geographically divided by an extrinsic barrier (e.g., a river, mountain range, or glacier). The two populations were then in allopatry. While isolated, they diverged due to genetic drift and/or different selective pressures, eventually becoming reproductively isolated (speciating). At a later time, the geographic barrier disappeared, allowing the two newly formed species to expand their ranges. Their ranges eventually expanded to the point where they now completely overlap.\n\nNow, we evaluate which hypothesis better explains the key observation: that *both* species are found *exclusively* on *Argenta singularis*.\n\nUnder the sympatric model, this observation is easily explained. The common ancestor was specialized on the plant, and both daughter species inherited this specialization.\n\nUnder the allopatric model, the explanation becomes much more complex. This model would require the following chain of events:\n- An ancestral population is split geographically.\n- The two populations diverge into separate species. During this time in isolation, they might have retained the original host preference, or one or both might have adapted to new hosts available in their separate locations.\n- The geographic barrier vanishes.\n- The two species expand their ranges and come into secondary contact.\n- Crucially, upon coming into secondary contact, both species must end up with an exclusive preference for the exact same host plant, *Argenta singularis*. If they had diverged in their host use while allopatric, this would require one species to switch back to the original host. If they both retained the preference, it's more plausible, but the entire sequence of geographic separation, removal of the barrier, and perfect range re-overlap is still more convoluted than in-situ speciation.\n\nTherefore, the allopatric hypothesis requires a longer and more complex series of events, with the final ecological configuration (both species exclusively on the same plant) being a particularly strong constraint that makes the sequence less probable than the simpler sympatric explanation. The sympatric model is more parsimonious.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n- **A**: This statement accurately captures the core argument based on parsimony. It correctly points out that the allopatric model necessitates a more complex series of events, with the ecological convergence/retention of a highly specific, shared resource use being a key difficulty. This makes the allopatric model less parsimonious. This is the correct answer.\n\n- **B**: This statement is incorrect. The current distribution of species (sympatry) does not rule out a past period of allopatry. The process of secondary contact, where formerly allopatric species' ranges expand to overlap, is a well-established concept in evolutionary biology.\n\n- **C**: This statement is based on a false premise. \"Sister species\" indicates a cladistic relationship (they are each other's closest relatives), but it does not, by itself, provide information about the absolute time of divergence. Speciation can occur over vast or relatively short time scales, and a cycle of allopatry and secondary contact could certainly occur within the timeframe of many speciation events.\n\n- **D**: This statement is incorrect. While pre-zygotic isolation (like pheromone differences) is essential for sympatric speciation, it can also readily evolve in allopatric populations as a byproduct of genetic divergence in other traits. There is no rule that such isolation can only evolve in sympatry.\n\n- **E**: This statement is biologically incorrect. The complete overlap in range and dependence on a single resource would suggest a high potential for, or a history of, intense interspecific competition. Sympatric speciation often proceeds via mechanisms that *reduce* this competition (i.e., resource partitioning), but the overlap itself does not imply an absence of competition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1967533"}]}
