This exercise introduces the concept of a composite hybrid index, a powerful quantitative tool that standardizes and combines multiple physical traits into a single score. By calculating this index, you will practice a fundamental technique used by field biologists to classify individuals on a continuum from one parental species to the other [@problem_id:1939790].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying a hybrid zone where the ranges of two closely related species of montane wildflowers, *Petalidium alpinum* and *Petalidium saxatile*, overlap. To quantify the extent of hybridization, the biologist uses a composite hybrid index. This index places an individual on a scale from 0 (pure *P. alpinum*) to 1 (pure *P. saxatile*). The index is calculated by first normalizing the score for each of several morphological traits and then taking the arithmetic mean of these normalized scores.\n\nThe biologist collects data from large, geographically isolated (allopatric) populations to establish pure species averages. Let P1 denote the mean values for *P. alpinum* and P2 denote the mean values for *P. saxatile*. A single plant, \"Specimen X,\" is then collected from the center of the hybrid zone. The data for five traits are as follows:\n\n*   **Corolla Tube Length (mm):** P1 = 18.5, P2 = 26.0, Specimen X = 23.5\n*   **Stigma Height (mm):** P1 = 12.0, P2 = 19.5, Specimen X = 14.5\n*   **Leaf Area ($cm^2$):** P1 = 4.20, P2 = 7.80, Specimen X = 6.90\n*   **Stem Trichome Density (count per $cm^2$):** P1 = 85, P2 = 30, Specimen X = 55\n*   **Seed Mass (mg):** P1 = 0.75, P2 = 1.15, Specimen X = 1.05\n\nCalculate the hybrid index for Specimen X.

This problem explores how the different inheritance patterns of nuclear DNA (from both parents) and mitochondrial DNA (from the mother only) can serve as a powerful forensic tool. By analyzing the genetic signature of hybrids, you can deduce the direction of the crosses that produced them, providing key insights into the reproductive dynamics of the hybrid zone [@problem_id:1939789].", "problem": "In a narrow valley, a team of ornithologists is studying a hybrid zone between two closely related, newly discovered bird species: the Alpine Finch (let's call it Species A) and the Boreal Finch (Species B). Birds in this zone appear to have a mix of physical traits from both parent species. To understand the dynamics of hybridization, the researchers collect genetic samples from a large number of these hybrid birds.\n\nThe analysis reveals a consistent pattern. All sampled hybrid individuals possess nuclear DNA (nDNA) markers from both Species A and Species B. However, when their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is sequenced, every single hybrid is found to have mtDNA that is identical to that of Species A and completely distinct from that of Species B.\n\nBased solely on this genetic evidence, what is the most direct and specific conclusion that can be drawn about the mating events that have produced these hybrid offspring?\n\nA. The hybrid-producing crosses have exclusively involved females of Species A and males of Species B.\n\nB. The hybrid-producing crosses have exclusively involved females of Species B and males of Species A.\n\nC. Mating is random between the two species, with males and females of both species contributing equally to the formation of hybrids.\n\nD. Species A is the more evolutionarily ancient species, and Species B is a more recently diverged lineage.\n\nE. The F1 hybrid offspring are all sterile and cannot backcross with the parent species.", "solution": "We begin by stating the relevant inheritance principles. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) is inherited biparentally, with each offspring receiving one set of nuclear markers from the mother and one set from the father. By contrast, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is generally inherited strictly maternally in birds, so an offspring’s mtDNA matches that of its mother. Therefore, the source species of an offspring’s mtDNA identifies the maternal parent’s species in the mating that produced that offspring.\n\nFrom the data, all sampled hybrids possess nDNA markers from both Species A and Species B. This confirms that the individuals are indeed hybrids arising from mating between the two species, because biparental nuclear inheritance necessarily yields mixed nuclear markers when parents are from different species.\n\nCrucially, every hybrid has mtDNA identical to Species A and completely distinct from Species B. Because mtDNA traces the maternal line, this directly implies that the mother in each hybrid-producing mating must have been Species A. If females of both species were contributing as mothers, then some hybrids would carry Species B mtDNA; none do. If the mothers had been exclusively Species B, then hybrids would carry Species B mtDNA; they do not. Thus, the most direct and specific inference is that the hybrid-producing crosses involved females of Species A and males of Species B.\n\nEvaluating the options: Option A matches this inference. Option B contradicts the observed mtDNA. Option C would predict a mixture of A and B mtDNA among hybrids, which is not observed. Option D concerns evolutionary history and cannot be inferred from the mtDNA pattern alone. Option E concerns fertility and cannot be concluded from these genetic data.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1939789"}, {"introduction": "A critical question in any hybrid zone is *why* hybrids might have lower fitness. Is this due to intrinsic genetic problems (endogenous selection), or because they are poorly adapted to the local environment (exogenous selection)?

To determine the causes of this low hybrid fitness, evolutionary biologists conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment.\n\nSeeds from pure *L. humilis*, pure *O. celsa*, and their F1 hybrids were planted in three distinct garden environments:\n1.  A \"Low-Altitude Garden\" located within the natural habitat of *L. humilis*.\n2.  A \"High-Altitude Garden\" located within the natural habitat of *O. celsa*.\n3.
