This first exercise allows you to apply Mendelian principles to predict how and when hybrid breakdown occurs based on the dominance relationships of the interacting alleles [@problem_id:1920197]. By tracking alleles through F1 and F2 generations, you'll see precisely how incompatibilities, hidden within parent populations, are revealed in their hybrid offspring.", "problem": "Consider a classic case of a Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibility (DMI), a model of how reproductive isolation can evolve between two populations. Imagine two allopatric populations of a diploid organism.\n\nInitially, the ancestral population has the genotype $A_1A_1b_1b_1$ at two unlinked genetic loci, A and B. A mutation arises at locus A in the first population and sweeps to fixation, resulting in a population with genotype $A_2A_2b_1b_1$. A different mutation arises at locus B in the second population and also sweeps to fixation, resulting in a population with genotype $A_1A_1b_2b_2$. Both of these derived populations are fully viable and fertile.\n\nAfter a period of divergence, the geographic barrier is removed, and individuals from the two populations are allowed to interbreed. A cross is performed between an individual from the first population ($A_2A_2b_1b_1$) and an individual from the second population ($A_1A_1b_2b_2$) to produce an F1 generation. Individuals from the F1 generation are then interbred to produce an F2 generation.\n\nThe DMI in this system is expressed as embryonic inviability. This inviability occurs only in individuals that possess at least one copy of the $A_2$ allele (i.e., the incompatibility at locus A is dominant) AND are homozygous for the $b_2$ allele (i.e., the incompatibility at locus B is recessive).\n\nAssuming Mendelian inheritance and that the two loci assort independently, which of the following statements correctly describes when inviability first appears and in what proportion of that generation's offspring?\n\nA. F1 generation, with a proportion of 1/4 of the offspring being inviable.\n\nB. F2 generation, with a proportion of 1/16 of the offspring being inviable.\n\nC. F2 generation, with a proportion of 3/16 of the offspring being inviable.\n\nD. F1 generation, with all offspring being inviable.\n\nE. F2 generation, with a proportion of 9/16 of the offspring being inviable.", "solution": "The parental cross is between $A_{2}A_{2}b_{1}b_{1}$ and $A_{1}A_{1}b_{2}b_{2}$. By Mendelian inheritance and independent assortment, all F1 offspring are $A_{1}A_{2}b_{1}b_{2}$, since each F1 receives $A_{2}b_{1}$ from one parent and $A_{1}b_{2}$ from the other.\n\nThe Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility requires at least one $A_{2}$ allele and homozygosity for $b_{2}$ to cause inviability. In the F1, although each individual has at least one $A_{2}$, they are heterozygous $b_{1}b_{2}$, so no F1 are inviable. Thus inviability does not appear in the F1.\n\nFor the F2, intercrossing $A_{1}A_{2}b_{1}b_{2}$ with itself and using independent assortment, the segregation at each locus is:\n$$\nA\\text{ locus: }A_{1}A_{1}:\\,A_{1}A_{2}:\\,A_{2}A_{2} = \\frac{1}{4}:\\frac{1}{2}:\\frac{1}{4},\n\\qquad\nB\\text{ locus: }b_{1}b_{1}:\\,b_{1}b_{2}:\\,b_{2}b_{2} = \\frac{1}{4}:\\frac{1}{2}:\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nLet $I$ be the event of inviability.

This next practice models the origin of a DMI, treating the fixation of new mutations as a probabilistic event [@problem_id:1920187].

The two loci, $C$ and $P$, control skin pigmentation, and new alleles can arise through mutation. In the new, isolated environments, these mutations are effectively neutral and can drift to fixation.\n\nThe rate of substitution (the process of a new mutation arising and becoming fixed in the population) for locus $C$ is $k_C = 2.50 \\times 10^{-7}$ substitutions per generation. The rate of substitution for locus $P$ is $k_P = 4.00 \\times 10^{-7}$ substitutions per generation.\n\nA new allele at locus $C$ (denoted $C2$) is phenotypically compatible with the ancestral allele $P1$. Similarly, a new allele at locus $P$ (denoted $P2$) is compatible with the ancestral allele $C1$. However, a negative epistatic interaction occurs between the new derived alleles: any individual carrying at least one $C2$ allele and at least one $P2$ allele is inviable and does not survive to birth. This is a classic Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility.\n\nAssuming the two populations evolve independently for $T = 50,000$ generations, calculate the total probability that a Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility has arisen between them. For this calculation, assume that the substitution rates are low enough that the probability of more than one substitution event occurring at a single locus, or substitutions occurring at both loci within the same lineage, is negligible and can be ignored.\n\nGive your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Each locus in each isolated population accumulates substitutions as an independent Poisson process with rate per generation given by $k_{C}$ for locus $C$ and $k_{P}$ for locus $P$. Over $T$ generations, the expected number of substitutions at each locus within a lineage is $\\lambda_{C} = k_{C}T$ and $\\lambda_{P} = k_{P}T$. The exact probability that at least one substitution occurs at a locus is $1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$, but the problem stipulates that substitution rates are low enough that the probabilities of more than one substitution at a single locus and of substitutions at both loci within the same lineage are negligible.

With independence between the two lineages, the probability that $P_{\\text{East}}$ substitutes at $C$ and $P_{\\text{West}}$ substitutes at $P$ is approximately $(k_{C}T)(k_{P}T)$, and the reverse assignment contributes the same amount.

When a pure-breeding individual of Fungus-A is crossed with a pure-breeding individual of Fungus-B, the resulting F1 diploid hybrids are all viable and fertile.\n\nA geneticist performs a backcross experiment by crossing an F1 hybrid with an individual from the pure-breeding parental stock of Fungus-A. Upon analyzing a large number of the backcross progeny, the geneticist observes that exactly 6.25% of them are fertile, with the remainder being sterile.\n\nAssume that the observed sterility is due to Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. This means that new alleles that became fixed in one population are incompatible with new alleles that became fixed at different loci in the other population. For sterility to be expressed, an individual must possess at least one copy of the derived allele from the Fungus-A lineage AND at least one copy of the derived allele from the Fungus-B lineage for any given interacting gene pair.
