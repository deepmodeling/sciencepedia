This first practice [@problem_id:1935946] presents a classic case of hybrid inviability and challenges you to identify the most widely accepted explanation, the dominance theory. By working through this scenario, you will learn to distinguish how recessive alleles on the X chromosome, when unmasked in the hemizygous heterogametic sex, can cause postzygotic isolation, a cornerstone concept in speciation genetics.", "problem": "Two closely related but geographically isolated species of rodents, Species P and Species Q, are brought into a laboratory for hybridization studies. Both species utilize an $XY$ sex-determination system, where males are the heterogametic sex ($XY$) and females are the homogametic sex ($XX$).\n\nA cross is performed between a female from Species P and a male from Species Q. The $F_1$ generation of this cross exhibits a striking anomaly: a large number of viable and fertile female offspring are born, but the number of viable male offspring is near zero, with most male embryos failing to survive to term. This observed pattern is a classic example of Haldane's Rule.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most robust and widely accepted genetic explanation for this specific pattern of male-biased hybrid inviability?\n\nA. Recessive alleles on the X chromosome from Species P, which have negative epistatic interactions with autosomal genes from Species Q, are expressed in the hemizygous F1 males but are masked by dominant, compatible alleles in the heterozygous F1 females.\n\nB. The Y chromosome from Species Q carries \"speciation genes\" that are fundamentally incompatible with the X chromosome from Species P, directly triggering a lethal genetic cascade in all male zygotes.\n\nC. The mitochondrial DNA, inherited maternally from the Species P female, is incompatible with the nuclear genome contributed by the Species Q father. This cytonuclear conflict leads to systemic metabolic failure that is more pronounced in males due to their higher metabolic rate during development.\n\nD. During meiosis in the Species Q father, a phenomenon known as sex-linked meiotic drive causes the degradation of a majority of Y-chromosome-bearing sperm, leading to a drastically reduced fertilization rate by male-producing gametes.\n\nE. The F1 hybrid state triggers a breakdown in the dosage compensation mechanism for the X chromosome in males, leading to a fatal overexpression of X-linked genes, while females are unaffected due to possessing two X chromosomes.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the key biological principle: Haldane's Rule states that when in the offspring of two different animal species or subspecies one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the heterogametic sex. In species with an XY system, males are the heterogametic sex. The observed pattern—near absence of viable $F_1$ males from a cross between a female of Species P and a male of Species Q—fits Haldane's Rule.\n\nTo analyze the genetics of the cross, denote the sex chromosomes and their origin. $F_1$ males have genotype $X_{P}Y_{Q}$ and $F_1$ females have genotype $X_{P}X_{Q}$. Under the dominance theory explanation of Haldane's Rule, X-linked hybrid incompatibilities that are recessive are exposed in the hemizygous heterogametic sex. Specifically, consider Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities where alleles that evolved separately in the two lineages are compatible within their own genomic backgrounds but interact negatively when combined. If the incompatible factor on the X chromosome from Species P is recessive and its incompatibility arises via epistasis with autosomal alleles from Species Q, then:\n- In $F_1$ males ($X_{P}Y_{Q}$), the recessive X-linked allele from Species P is fully expressed because males are hemizygous for the X, so there is no masking by an alternative allele on the X from Species Q. Negative epistasis between the $X_{P}$ locus and autosomal loci from Species Q can therefore cause inviability in males.\n- In $F_1$ females ($X_{P}X_{Q}$), the same recessive X-linked incompatibility is masked by the presence of a compatible dominant allele from Species Q on the other X, so females remain viable and fertile.\n\nThis logic precisely matches statement A, which invokes recessive X-linked alleles from the maternal species interacting epistatically with autosomal genes from the paternal species, producing male-specific inviability due to hemizygosity and masking in females due to heterozygosity.\n\nWe now briefly exclude the alternatives:\n- Statement B proposes a primary role for the Y chromosome carrying speciation genes incompatible with the maternal X. Empirically, the Y chromosome generally contributes little to hybrid inviability relative to recessive X-linked incompatibilities, and dominance theory provides broader support across taxa; thus B is not the most robust explanation.\n- Statement C invokes cytonuclear incompatibility from maternally inherited mitochondria. Such incompatibilities would typically affect both sexes; a strictly male-biased inviability pattern is not well explained by general mitochondrial-nuclear mismatch, especially without a sex-specific mechanism beyond a speculative higher male metabolic rate.\n- Statement D describes sex-linked meiotic drive in the father, which would bias the sex ratio at fertilization but does not account for the specific observation of male embryos failing to survive to term; it addresses prezygotic or gametic distortions rather than postzygotic inviability.\n- Statement E suggests breakdown of dosage compensation causing fatal overexpression of X-linked genes in males; this is not the canonical or widely supported mechanism for Haldane's Rule, and moreover dosage compensation failures would not necessarily spare females nor produce the specific male-biased inviability pattern observed.\n\nTherefore, the most widely accepted and robust explanation that matches the described pattern is the dominance theory of recessive X-linked incompatibilities exposed in the heterogametic sex, as described in statement A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1935946"}, {"introduction": "Haldane's rule is a powerful generalization, but its correct application requires precision. This exercise [@problem_id:1935922] tests your understanding by shifting to a ZW sex-determination system, where females are the heterogametic sex. The key skill here is to carefully evaluate an experimental outcome against the rule's formal definition, reinforcing that the rule applies to the heterogametic sex, regardless of whether that is the male or the female.", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is investigating reproductive barriers between two closely related but distinct species of garter snakes, Species A and Species B. In snakes, sex is determined by the $ZW$ system, where males are the homogametic sex ($ZZ$) and females are the heterogametic sex ($ZW$). The researchers perform hybridization experiments by cross-breeding individuals from both species. Their experiments yield viable $F_1$ hybrid offspring of both sexes. However, upon reaching sexual maturity, they observe a distinct pattern: all $F_1$ hybrid males ($ZZ$) are sterile and unable to produce viable sperm, while all $F_1$ hybrid females ($ZW$) are fertile and capable of reproducing.\n\nHaldane's rule is a well-documented observation in evolutionary biology which states that if in the offspring of a cross between two different animal species or races one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the heterogametic sex.\n\nBased on the experimental results from the garter snake hybridization, which of the following statements correctly evaluates the findings in the context of Haldane's rule?\n\nA. The findings are consistent with Haldane's rule because one of the hybrid sexes is sterile.\n\nB. The findings are inconsistent with Haldane's rule, which predicts that the homogametic sex (in this case, males) should be fertile.\n\nC. The findings are inconsistent with Haldane's rule, which predicts that the heterogametic sex (in this case, females) should be the one showing sterility.\n\nD. The findings are consistent with Haldane's rule, as the ZW system is an exception where the rule applies to the homogametic sex.\n\nE. The observation cannot be evaluated by Haldane's rule, because the rule only applies to organisms with XY sex-determination systems.", "solution": "We first state Haldane’s rule: in interspecific hybrids, if one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the heterogametic sex. In the ZW sex-determination system, males are homogametic with genotype $ZZ$, and females are heterogametic with genotype $ZW$.\n\nFrom the experiment, $F_1$ hybrid males ($ZZ$) are sterile, while $F_1$ hybrid females ($ZW$) are fertile. Applying Haldane’s rule, if sterility affects one sex, it should be the heterogametic sex. In this system, the heterogametic sex is the female ($ZW$). However, the observed sterile sex is the male ($ZZ$), which is the homogametic sex. Therefore, the observation contradicts Haldane’s rule.\n\nEvaluating the choices:\n- A is incorrect because merely having one sterile sex is not sufficient; Haldane’s rule specifies which sex (the heterogametic) should be affected.\n- B states inconsistency but frames it as predicting the homogametic sex should be fertile; while a corollary, it is less direct than invoking the heterogametic prediction.\n- C correctly identifies inconsistency because the rule predicts the heterogametic sex (females, $ZW$) should show sterility, which is not observed.\n- D is incorrect; there is no exception in ZW systems that reverses the rule.\n- E is incorrect; Haldane’s rule applies across XY and ZW systems.\n\nThus, the correct evaluation is that the findings are inconsistent with Haldane’s rule because it predicts the heterogametic sex should be the one showing sterility.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1935922"}, {"introduction": "The final step in understanding an evolutionary pattern like Haldane's rule is to explore the methods used to uncover its genetic architecture.

To investigate the genetic basis of this rule, a study is conducted using two mouse species: *Mus musculus* and *Mus spretus*. When a *Mus musculus* female ($X^m X^m$) is crossed with a *Mus spretus* male ($X^s Y$), the resulting $F_1$ female offspring ($X^m X^s$) are fertile, but the $F_1$ male offspring ($X^m Y$) are sterile, consistent with Haldane's rule.\n\nTo map the genes on the X chromosome responsible for this sterility, a backcross experiment is performed. The fertile $F_1$ females ($X^m X^s$) are crossed with parental *Mus musculus* males ($X^m Y$). This produces a large $N_2$ generation of male offspring. Each $N_2$ male receives a Y chromosome from its father and one of the two X chromosomes ($X^m$ or $X^s$) from its F1 mother.
