Step 1 separates organisms by leg count:\n- 1a (6 legs) leads to step 2.\n- 1b (8 legs) leads to step 3.\n\nAt step 2, organisms with 6 legs are further split by presence of wings:\n- 2a (6 legs, wings) leads to step 4.\n- 2b (6 legs, no wings) correctly identifies Cruriramosa plumosus, which matches the description of having 6 legs and no wings.\n\nAt step 3, organisms with 8 legs are split by presence of wings:\n- 3a (8 legs, wings) correctly identifies Petalaptera filiformis, which matches the description of having 8 legs and wings.\n- 3b (8 legs, no wings) correctly identifies Arachnoides aptera, which matches the description of having 8 legs and no wings.\n\nTherefore, step 4 must distinguish between the remaining species that fall under 2a, namely those with 6 legs and wings.

This practice explores how statistical distributions of measurements can reveal hidden patterns, particularly how a bimodal distribution in a key trait can strongly suggest the presence of two distinct morphological groups. By interpreting this hypothetical data, you will learn to distinguish between simple variation within a species and the significant gaps that may define separate species [@problem_id:1948532].", "problem": "An entomologist is studying a population of butterflies on a remote, newly-accessible island. A sample of 100 adult butterflies, believed to belong to the genus *Morpho*, is collected. To assess whether this sample represents one or two distinct species, the entomologist measures two morphological traits: the length of the forewing and the length of the tarsus (the final segment of the leg). The morphological species concept, which defines a species as a group of organisms sharing a unique and consistent set of structural features, is to be used for this initial classification.\n\nAfter analysis, the data reveals the following patterns:\n1.  **Forewing Length:** The measurements for forewing length form a continuous, unimodal frequency distribution that is roughly symmetrical, with a mean of 55.2 mm and a standard deviation of 3.1 mm.\n2.  **Tarsus Length:** The frequency distribution for tarsus length is distinctly bimodal, with two clear peaks and very few individuals having intermediate lengths. One cluster of individuals has a mean tarsus length of 7.8 mm, while the other cluster has a mean tarsus length of 10.3 mm.\n\nBased strictly on the application of the morphological species concept to this data, what is the most logical conclusion?\n\nA. The sample represents a single species because a unimodal distribution in even one of the measured traits is sufficient to group them together.\n\nB. The sample represents a single species that exhibits sexual dimorphism, where one sex has a longer tarsus than the other.\n\nC. The data is inconclusive because morphological data alone is insufficient; genetic analysis is required to make any species determination.\n\nD. The sample represents two distinct species because the bimodal distribution of a key diagnostic trait like tarsus length suggests the presence of two separate morphological groups.\n\nE. The sample represents two distinct species, but only because both traits (forewing and tarsus length) would need to be bimodal to confirm this.", "solution": "The morphological species concept classifies organisms into species based on consistent, discrete differences in structural features, with the expectation that intraspecific variation is typically continuous within traits, whereas interspecific differences often manifest as discontinuities with few or no intermediates.\n\nApplying this principle to the observed data requires weighing the diagnostic value and distributional form of each measured trait:\n1. The forewing length exhibits a continuous, unimodal, roughly symmetrical distribution around a mean with some spread (mean 55.2 mm, standard deviation 3.1 mm). Such a pattern is consistent with intraspecific variation and does not, by itself, provide grounds to split the sample into distinct morphological groups.\n2. The tarsus length exhibits a distinctly bimodal distribution with two clear peaks and very few intermediates, with clusters centered near 7.8 mm and 10.3 mm. Under the morphological species concept, a clear bimodal distribution with minimal intermediacy in a trait that is potentially diagnostic is strong evidence for two distinct morphological groups, consistent with the presence of two species.\n\nConsidering alternative interpretations:\n- Sexual dimorphism could, in some taxa, produce bimodal distributions in certain traits. However, strictly applying the morphological species concept to the presented morphology alone (without external evidence of sex or known dimorphism patterns) prioritizes the observed discrete morphological discontinuity as evidence for separate species. The concept does not require evidence from genetics, nor does it require bimodality across multiple traits when one key trait shows a strong, discrete split with few intermediates.\n- The unimodality of forewing length does not negate the diagnostic value of the tarsus length bimodality; different traits can exhibit different patterns of variation, and a single trait showing a clear, discrete break can suffice to delimit species under this concept.\n- Requiring both traits to be bimodal is an unnecessarily stringent criterion not mandated by the morphological species concept.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because unimodality in one trait is not sufficient evidence to group all individuals into a single species when another key trait exhibits a strong bimodal split.\n- B is less consistent with the directive to use the morphological species concept on the given data alone; invoking sexual dimorphism is an untested explanatory hypothesis not supported by additional evidence here.\n- C is incompatible with the instruction to base the conclusion strictly on morphological data using the morphological species concept.\n- D aligns directly with the concept: a clear bimodal, minimally overlapping distribution in a diagnostic morphological trait supports two species.\n- E is incorrect because the concept does not require bimodality in multiple traits to recognize distinct species.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion under the morphological species concept, given the data, is that the sample represents two distinct species due to the bimodal distribution of tarsus length with few intermediates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1948532"}, {"introduction": "A critical challenge in applying the morphological species concept is accounting for changes during an organism's life. This practice explores allometry, the differential growth of body parts, where shape changes as an organism increases in size. Using the allometric growth equation $L = k W^{b}$, you will see how individuals of different sizes from separate populations can have misleadingly similar trait measurements, highlighting the need to consider developmental stages for accurate morphological comparison [@problem_id:1948526].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is investigating two geographically isolated populations of a crab species, one from Island A and one from Island B. The biologist suspects these populations may be undergoing cryptic speciation. A key morphological trait for this species is the allometric growth of the major claw (chela) in males, where the chela's length grows at a different rate relative to the overall body size. The body size is measured by the carapace width, $W$. The relationship between chela length, $L$, and carapace width, $W$, is described by the power law $L = k W^{b}$, where all lengths are measured in millimeters (mm).\n\nThrough extensive sampling, the biologist has determined the allometric growth equations for adult males in each population:\n- Population A: $L_A = 0.15 W^{1.8}$\n- Population B: $L_B = 0.20 W^{1.8}$\n\nA field assistant collects one large male crab from each island. By a remarkable coincidence, both crabs are found to have a major chela of the exact same length, $L_0 = 50.0$ mm.
