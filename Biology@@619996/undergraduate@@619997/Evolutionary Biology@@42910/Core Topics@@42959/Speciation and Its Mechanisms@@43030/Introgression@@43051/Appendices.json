This exercise simulates the process of identifying an introgressed block using genetic markers, which is a fundamental skill for geneticists.

Genetic studies have established that at a series of 10 specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) marker loci along a particular chromosome, the two species are diagnostically different. All individuals of *S. arboreus* are fixed for allele '1' at these loci, while all individuals of *M. petraeus* are fixed for allele '0'.\n\nOccasionally, these species hybridize. An F1 hybrid (the direct offspring of a *S. arboreus* x *M. petraeus* cross) is then backcrossed with a pure-breeding *S. arboreus* individual. You analyze the genotype of a single offspring from this backcross. The genotypes at the 10 diagnostic SNP loci for this individual are listed below, with positions given in kilobases (kb) from the start of the chromosome.\n\n- Position 10 kb: Genotype 1/1\n- Position 25 kb: Genotype 1/1\n- Position 40 kb: Genotype 1/0\n- Position 55 kb: Genotype 1/0\n- Position 70 kb: Genotype 1/0\n- Position 85 kb: Genotype 1/0\n- Position 100 kb: Genotype 1/1\n- Position 115 kb: Genotype 1/1\n- Position 130 kb: Genotype 1/1\n- Position 145 kb: Genotype 1/1\n\nBased on this data, what is the most likely span of the chromosomal block that has been introgressed from *Montanus petraeus* into this individual's genome?\n\nA.

In the backcross to a $1/1$ parent, the offspring’s genotype at any locus equals $1/1$ if the F1 gamete contributed allele $1$ at that locus, and equals $1/0$ if the F1 gamete contributed allele $0$ at that locus. During meiosis in the F1, recombination produces a gamete that is a mosaic of the two homologs, so the $0$ alleles from the $0$-bearing homolog are transmitted in contiguous blocks bounded by crossover points.\n\nTherefore, in the backcross offspring, a contiguous run of $1/0$ genotypes marks the span inherited from the $0$-bearing chromosome (introgressed from the $0$-fixed species), while flanking $1/1$ genotypes mark regions where the F1 gamete contributed allele $1$. The observed pattern shows $1/1$ at 10 kb and 25 kb, a contiguous block of $1/0$ at 40, 55, 70, and 85 kb, and then $1/1$ again from 100 kb through 145 kb. The most parsimonious interpretation is a single introgressed block whose boundaries lie between the last $1/1$ before the block and the first $1/1$ after the block, i.e., with crossovers between $25$–$40$ kb and $85$–$100$ kb.

This practice introduces the Patterson's D-statistic, a powerful test that compares patterns of shared derived alleles across four taxa to detect introgression even when it is not visually obvious. Understanding this method is key to exploring the hidden histories of hybridization that modern genomics can reveal.[@problem_id:1941480]", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is studying a group of alpine insects. Based on extensive morphological and ecological data, they have established a working species phylogeny for three closely related species: *Aptinus alpinus*, *Aptinus borealis*, and *Cinctus montanus*. The phylogeny indicates that *A. alpinus* and *A. borealis* are sister species, forming a clade that is sister to *C. montanus*. A more distantly related species, *Vallis humilis*, is used as the outgroup. This relationship can be summarized with the Newick format tree as `((Aptinus alpinus, Aptinus borealis), Cinctus montanus), Vallis humilis;`.\n\nTo investigate the history of gene flow, the researchers perform whole-genome sequencing on individuals from all four species. They analyze biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome, focusing on sites where the outgroup (*V. humilis*) possesses the ancestral allele ('A') and at least one of the other three species possesses a derived allele ('B'). They compute the Patterson's D-statistic for the ordered quartet of species (P1, P2, P3, O), where P1 = *A. alpinus*, P2 = *A. borealis*, P3 = *C. montanus*, and O = *V. humilis*. Their analysis yields a D-statistic value that is significantly positive.\n\nBased on this result, which of the following is the most direct and well-supported conclusion?\n\nA.

A significantly positive $D$ means $n_{\\text{ABBA}}>n_{\\text{BABA}}$, i.e., there are more sites where P2 and P3 share the derived allele than sites where P1 and P3 share the derived allele. In the context of the given species tree, this asymmetry is most directly explained by postdivergence gene flow between P2 and P3, that is, between Aptinus borealis and Cinctus montanus. Conversely, a significantly negative $D$ would have indicated excess sharing between P1 and P3 (Aptinus alpinus and Cinctus montanus).\n\nTherefore, a significantly positive $D$ for the ordered quartet $(\\text{A. alpinus}, \\text{A. borealis}, \\text{C. montanus}, \\text{V. humilis})$ most directly supports gene flow between Cinctus montanus and Aptinus borealis. This rules out option A as the primary inference because $D$ does not test for gene flow between the sister pair P1 and P2; it tests asymmetry in sharing between P3 and each of P1 versus P2. It also rules out D, since a significant deviation from zero rejects incomplete lineage sorting as the sole cause, and E, because $D$ detects introgression and asymmetry of allele sharing given a specified topology rather than overturning the species phylogeny.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1941480"}, {"introduction": "After confirming that introgression has occurred, the next question is often about its history: was it a single event in the distant past, or is it an ongoing process? This problem explores how the physical length of introgressed DNA segments can function as a \"genomic clock,\" as recombination breaks them down over time. By applying population genetic models to observed tract lengths, you can distinguish between different scenarios of gene flow and reconstruct a species' evolutionary past.[@problem_id:1941464]", "problem": "A population biologist is investigating the evolutionary history of *Speyeria insularis*, an isolated island butterfly species. Genomic sequencing has revealed the presence of DNA segments originating from a related mainland species, *Speyeria continentalis*. The biologist aims to determine whether this introgression resulted from a single, ancient event or from ongoing, recent gene flow.\n\nTwo competing hypotheses are proposed:\n1.  **The Ancient Pulse Hypothesis**: A single, large hybridization event occurred $T$ generations in the past.\n2.  **The Continuous Migration Hypothesis**: A small, steady fraction of the island population, $m$, is replaced by migrants from the mainland each generation.\n\nThe breakdown of introgressed segments by recombination provides a way to test these hypotheses. The average length, $L$, of an introgressed genomic block is related to the evolutionary scenario. The biologist is using a genetic map where distances and lengths are measured in Morgans (M), with 1 M being the length over which one crossover event is expected per generation per meiosis. The recombination rate per Morgan is thus $r = 1$ M$^{-1}$ per generation.\n\nThe following models are provided:\n-   For the Ancient Pulse model, the average length of a tract is given by $L = \\frac{1}{rT}$.\n-   For the Continuous Migration model, the system is assumed to be at equilibrium. The continuous influx of new, long tracts and the breakdown of old tracts results in an average tract length of $L = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2r}}$. At this equilibrium, the total proportion of the genome that is of migrant origin, $p_{eq}$, is given by the relationship $p_{eq} \\approx 2m$.\n\nGenomic analysis of a large sample of *S. insularis* yields the following data:\n-   The total haploid genome size, $G$, is 250 centiMorgans (cM).\n-   The total length of introgressed DNA found in an average individual's genome is 12.5 cM.\n-   The observed average length of an individual introgressed block, $L_{obs}$, is 0.0050 cM.\n\nBased on a quantitative analysis, determine which of the two hypotheses is consistent with all the observations.
