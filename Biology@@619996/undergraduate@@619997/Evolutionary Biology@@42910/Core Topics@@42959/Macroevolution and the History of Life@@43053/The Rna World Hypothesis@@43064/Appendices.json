For RNA specifically, the sugar must be ribose, the base must be one of the RNA bases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, or uracil), and the phosphate group must be present.\n\nFrom the list:\n- Ribose (B) is the correct pentose sugar for RNA; deoxyribose (A) is specific to DNA and therefore not suitable for RNA.\n- Uracil (E) is an RNA nitrogenous base; thymine (D) is a DNA base and thus not used in RNA.\n- Phosphate (G) is required to form the nucleotide phosphate backbone.\n- Glycine (C) is an amino acid and not a nucleotide component.\n- Glucose (F) is a hexose sugar and not the correct pentose for nucleotides.\n\nTherefore, the complete and minimal set to construct a single RNA nucleotide from the given options is ribose (B), uracil (E), and phosphate (G).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BEG}$$", "id": "1974257"}, {"introduction": "A central tenet of the RNA world hypothesis is the concept of a 'ribozyme'—an RNA molecule that can act as an enzyme. But how do we move from this idea to a testable, scientific claim? This practice puts you in the role of an experimental biochemist, analyzing data from a ribozyme self-cleavage experiment to calculate its catalytic rate, a key measure of its efficiency, using the principles of first-order kinetics [@problem_id:1974201].", "problem": "A researcher is investigating a synthetic 120-nucleotide RNA molecule for self-cleaving catalytic activity, a key property explored in the context of the RNA world hypothesis. To quantify this activity, the RNA strand is chemically synthesized with a single radioactive phosphorus-32 ($^{32}$P) atom at its 5'-end, allowing for sensitive detection.\n\nThe self-cleavage reaction is initiated by placing the RNA in a buffer solution containing a specific concentration of magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$) and maintained at a constant temperature, simulating a plausible prebiotic environment. The total amount of radioactive RNA at the start of the experiment ($t=0$) is quantified and let's denote it as $N_0$.\n\nAfter an incubation period of $t = 35.0$ minutes, a sample is taken, and the reaction is quenched. The contents of the sample are then separated using gel electrophoresis, a technique that separates molecules by size.

The reaction can be modeled as $A \\rightarrow P$, where $A$ is the full-length RNA molecule and $P$ represents the cleavage products.\n\nFor a first-order reaction, the concentration of the reactant $A$ at time $t$, denoted as $[A]_t$, is related to its initial concentration $[A]_0$ by the integrated rate law:\n$$[A]_t = [A]_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order rate constant and $t$ is time.\n\nIn this experiment, the amount of RNA is quantified by its radioactivity. Let $N_t$ be the amount of radioactivity corresponding to the full-length (uncleaved) RNA at time $t$, and $N_0$ be the initial amount of radioactivity at $t=0$. Since the amount of radioactivity is directly proportional to the concentration of the RNA molecules, we can write the rate law in terms of radioactivity counts:\n$$N_t = N_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\n\nThe problem states that after $t = 35.0$ minutes, the amount of remaining uncleaved RNA is 58.0% of the initial amount.
