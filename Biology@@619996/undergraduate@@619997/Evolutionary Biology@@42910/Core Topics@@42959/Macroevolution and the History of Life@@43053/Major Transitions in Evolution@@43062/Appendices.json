Present in the immediate vicinity are two distinct groups of its relatives: a group of three full siblings and a group of four half-siblings. The coefficient of relatedness between the squirrel and its full siblings is defined as $r=1/2$, and with its half-siblings as $r=1/4$. The squirrel has three possible actions it can take in response to the predator. The costs and benefits of these actions are measured in units of fitness, representing changes in survival probability.\n\n1.  **Remain Silent:** This action has no fitness cost to the squirrel itself ($C=0$), but also provides no benefit to its relatives, as they remain unaware of the predator ($B=0$).\n2.  **Standard Alarm Call:** This action draws some attention from the hawk, imposing a fitness cost on the squirrel of $C=0.15$. The call effectively warns all nearby relatives, granting each of them a fitness benefit of $B=0.40$.\n3.  **Loud Alarm Call:** This more conspicuous call is much riskier, imposing a fitness cost on the squirrel of $C=0.50$. The benefit is also greater, as the loud call grants each relative a fitness benefit of $B=0.90$.\n\nAssuming that natural selection favors behaviors that maximize an individual's inclusive fitness, which of the following actions is the most evolutionarily advantageous choice for the squirrel?\n\nA.

This exercise [@problem_id:1945132] allows you to build a mathematical model to explore that very trade-off, balancing the costs of competition within a group against the benefits of shared protection from predators. By optimizing a fitness function, you will gain insight into how natural selection can favor the formation of groups, the first crucial step towards the evolution of a new, higher-level organism.", "problem": "The transition from unicellular to multicellular life is one of the major evolutionary transitions. This shift involves a fundamental trade-off between the benefits of group living, such as protection, and the costs, such as increased competition for resources. Consider a hypothetical species of facultatively multicellular algae, *Protococcus aggregans*, which can exist either as solitary cells or in spherical colonies.\n\nWe can model the fitness of these two strategies based on their survival and reproduction. Let the fitness, $W$, be defined as the expected number of surviving offspring produced by a cell per day.\n\nFor a **solitary cell**:\nThe baseline reproductive rate is $R_0$ offspring per day. However, these cells are vulnerable to predation. Let $\\delta$ be the probability that a solitary cell is consumed by a predator on any given day.\n\nFor a cell in an **aggregate**:\nAn individual cell can join a colony of total size $N$ (including itself).\n- **Benefit (Predation Shielding)**: The colony as a whole is subject to the same predation pressure as a solitary cell, but when a predator attacks the colony, it only consumes a single cell. The risk is thus shared among all $N$ cells. We assume the probability of any specific cell in the colony being consumed per day is $\\frac{\\delta}{N}$.\n- **Cost (Resource Competition)**: Cells within the colony compete for light and nutrients. This competition reduces the reproductive rate. The reproductive rate of a cell in a colony of size $N$ is given by $R_N = R_0 \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1))$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive constant representing the intensity of competition.\n\nAssuming that natural selection will favor the colony size that maximizes the fitness of an individual cell within it, what is the optimal colony size, $N_{opt}$? For this analysis, treat the colony size $N$ as a continuous, positive real number.\n\nExpress your answer as a symbolic expression for $N_{opt}$ in terms of $\\delta$ and $\\alpha$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the optimal colony size, $N_{opt}$, that maximizes the fitness of an individual cell within the aggregate. The fitness, $W$, is defined as the product of the reproductive rate and the survival probability.\n\nFirst, let's write down the expression for the fitness of a cell in a colony of size $N$, which we denote as $W_a(N)$.\n\nThe reproductive rate for a cell in a colony of size $N$ is given as:\n$R_N = R_0 \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1))$\n\nThe daily probability of a cell in the colony being eaten is $\\frac{\\delta}{N}$. Therefore, the daily survival probability for that cell is:\n$S_N = 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}$\n\nThe fitness of a cell in the aggregate is the product of its reproductive rate and its survival probability:\n$W_a(N) = R_N \\times S_N = R_0 \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1)) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}\\right)$\n\nTo find the optimal colony size $N_{opt}$, we need to find the value of $N$ that maximizes $W_a(N)$. We can do this by taking the derivative of $W_a(N)$ with respect to $N$ and setting it to zero. Since $R_0$ is a positive constant, we can maximize the function $f(N) = \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1)) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}\\right)$ instead, which simplifies the calculation.\n\nWe use the product rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dN}(uv) = u\\frac{dv}{dN} + v\\frac{du}{dN}$, where $u(N) = \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1))$ and $v(N) = 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}$.\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of $u(N)$ and $v(N)$:\n$\\frac{du}{dN} = \\frac{d}{dN} \\exp(-\\alpha N + \\alpha) = -\\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha N + \\alpha) = -\\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1))$\n$\\frac{dv}{dN} = \\frac{d}{dN} \\left(1 - \\delta N^{-1}\\right) = - \\delta (-1) N^{-2} = \\frac{\\delta}{N^2}$\n\nNow, we apply the product rule to find $\\frac{df}{dN}$:\n$\\frac{df}{dN} = u\\frac{dv}{dN} + v\\frac{du}{dN}$\n$\\frac{df}{dN} = \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1)) \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{N^2}\\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}\\right) \\left(-\\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1))\\right)$\n\nTo find the maximum, we set the derivative to zero:\n$\\exp(-\\alpha(N-1)) \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{N^2}\\right) - \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}\\right) \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1)) = 0$\n\nWe can factor out the term $\\exp(-\\alpha(N-1))$, which is always positive for real $N$. Thus, for the expression to be zero, the term in the parentheses must be zero:\n$\\frac{\\delta}{N^2} - \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}\\right) = 0$\n$\\frac{\\delta}{N^2} - \\alpha + \\frac{\\alpha\\delta}{N} = 0$\n\nTo solve for $N$, we can multiply the entire equation by $N^2$ (we are looking for $N > 1$, so $N \\neq 0$):\n$\\delta - \\alpha N^2 + \\alpha\\delta N = 0$\n\nRearranging this into the standard form of a quadratic equation, $aN^2 + bN + c = 0$:\n$\\alpha N^2 - \\alpha\\delta N - \\delta = 0$\n\nWe can now use the quadratic formula, $N = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a = \\alpha$, $b = -\\alpha\\delta$, and $c = -\\delta$.\n\n$N = \\frac{-(-\\alpha\\delta) \\pm \\sqrt{(-\\alpha\\delta)^2 - 4(\\alpha)(-\\delta)}}{2\\alpha}$\n$N = \\frac{\\alpha\\delta \\pm \\sqrt{\\alpha^2\\delta^2 + 4\\alpha\\delta}}{2\\alpha}$\n\nSince $N$ represents the size of a colony, it must be a positive number. The parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$ are also positive. The term under the square root, $\\alpha^2\\delta^2 + 4\\alpha\\delta$, is strictly positive. Furthermore, $\\sqrt{\\alpha^2\\delta^2 + 4\\alpha\\delta} > \\sqrt{\\alpha^2\\delta^2} = \\alpha\\delta$.\nThis means the solution with the minus sign, $\\alpha\\delta - \\sqrt{\\alpha^2\\delta^2 + 4\\alpha\\delta}$, will be negative. Therefore, we must take the positive root for a physically meaningful solution.\n\n$N_{opt} = \\frac{\\alpha\\delta + \\sqrt{\\alpha^2\\delta^2 + 4\\alpha\\delta}}{2\\alpha}$\n\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$N_{opt} = \\frac{\\alpha\\delta}{2\\alpha} + \\frac{\\sqrt{\\alpha^2\\delta^2 + 4\\alpha\\delta}}{2\\alpha}$\n$N_{opt} = \\frac{\\delta}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha^2\\delta^2 + 4\\alpha\\delta}{4\\alpha^2}}$\n$N_{opt} = \\frac{\\delta}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha^2\\delta^2}{4\\alpha^2} + \\frac{4\\alpha\\delta}{4\\alpha^2}}$\n$N_{opt} = \\frac{\\delta}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta^2}{4} + \\frac{\\delta}{\\alpha}}$\n\nThis expression gives the optimal colony size $N_{opt}$ that maximizes the fitness of an individual cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\delta}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta^2}{4} + \\frac{\\delta}{\\alpha}}}$$", "id": "1945132"}, {"introduction": "The fascinating world of eusocial insects, with their sterile worker castes, offers a prime example of a major evolutionary transition.
