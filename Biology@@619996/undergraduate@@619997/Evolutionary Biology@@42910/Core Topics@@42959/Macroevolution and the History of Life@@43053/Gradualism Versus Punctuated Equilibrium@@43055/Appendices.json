This exercise will sharpen your understanding of how different observational windows can lead to vastly different interpretations of evolutionary tempo.", "problem": "An isolated population of island-dwelling birds shows variation in a key morphological trait: beak depth. The narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) for this trait is a constant 0.60. The evolutionary history of this trait is characterized by two distinct phases.\n\nFirst, the population undergoes a long period of evolutionary stasis lasting for 50,000 generations. During this time, the environment is stable, resulting in a very weak directional selection pressure which can be modeled by a small but constant selection differential ($S$) of 0.050 mm per generation.\n\nSecond, a sudden and severe environmental shift occurs, such as a prolonged drought that changes the available food sources. This event initiates a brief but intense period of rapid evolution lasting for 500 generations. During this period, a strong directional selection favors birds with deeper beaks, corresponding to a large and constant selection differential of 2.5 mm per generation.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist interested in long-term patterns might calculate an \"average rate of change\" by considering only the total change in beak depth across the entire timeframe (the stasis period plus the rapid evolution period) and dividing by the total number of generations. In contrast, the rate of evolution during the brief period of intense selection represents the \"punctuated\" change.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the rate of change during the rapid 500-generation period to the long-term average rate of change over the entire 50,500-generation interval.

Based on the data, the single punctuation event is hypothesized to have occurred between 3.0 Mya and 2.0 Mya. This is modeled as a shift from one stable mean ($\\mu_1$) to another ($\\mu_2$).
