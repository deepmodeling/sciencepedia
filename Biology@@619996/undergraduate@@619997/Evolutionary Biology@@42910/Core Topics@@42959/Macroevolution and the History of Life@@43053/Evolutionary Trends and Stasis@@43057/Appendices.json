{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The fossil record often presents long periods where species' morphologies appear remarkably unchanged, a phenomenon known as evolutionary stasis. However, interpreting this pattern requires careful consideration of both temporal and spatial data. This practice problem challenges you to think like a paleontologist, analyzing fossil evidence from multiple locations to deduce the most likely cause of apparent stasis followed by a local disappearance [@problem_id:1928046]. You will learn to distinguish between true evolutionary stagnation and the important alternative hypothesis of habitat tracking, where a species follows its preferred environment as it moves geographically.", "problem": "A paleontologist is studying a late Cenozoic sedimentary rock sequence in a specific river basin. The fossil record of a particular freshwater snail species, *Pleurocera constantis*, is exceptionally well-preserved in this sequence. The analysis of the rock layers reveals the following pattern:\n\n1.  **Lower Strata (5 million years old):** The sedimentology indicates a cool, fast-flowing river environment. These layers contain abundant fossils of *P. constantis*, all exhibiting a consistent, specific shell morphology.\n2.  **Middle Strata (4 to 5 million years old):** The environment remains a cool, fast-flowing river. Fossils of *P. constantis* are still abundant and are morphologically indistinguishable from those in the Lower Strata. The species appears to be in perfect stasis.\n3.  **Upper Strata (4 million years old):** The sedimentology indicates a dramatic environmental shift to a warm, slow-moving, marshy swamp. Fossils of *P. constantis* are completely absent from these and all subsequent layers in this basin.\n\nHowever, a separate research team studying a different basin several hundred kilometers to the north, at a higher elevation, finds abundant fossils of *P. constantis* in strata dated to precisely 4 million years old. These fossils are morphologically identical to the ones found in the Middle and Lower Strata of the first basin. The paleoenvironment of this northern basin at 4 million years ago is identified as a cool, fast-flowing river.\n\nBased on this complete set of observations, which of the following provides the most comprehensive explanation for the pattern of stasis and subsequent disappearance of *Pleurocera constantis* in the first river basin?\n\nA. The species experienced strong stabilizing selection in the first basin for a million years, which perfectly maintained its morphology until the environment changed too rapidly for adaptation to occur, leading to its extinction.\n\nB. The species was tracking its preferred habitat; as the climate warmed in the first basin, the population migrated north to a new location that still matched its ecological requirements, explaining both the morphological stasis and the local disappearance.\n\nC. Strong genetic and developmental constraints within the species prevented any evolutionary change, and the environmental shift in the first basin was too severe for it to survive, causing a local extinction event.\n\nD. The pattern is a classic example of punctuated equilibrium, where a long period of stasis is followed by a rapid, unrecorded speciation event, and the new species displaced *P. constantis*.\n\nE. The species' genetic diversity was so low that it was incapable of adapting to any environmental change, and its disappearance was simply the result of a random extinction event unrelated to the environmental shift.", "solution": "First, summarize the observed pattern. In the first basin, from 5 to between 4 and 5 million years ago, the paleoenvironment is a cool, fast-flowing river, and Pleurocera constantis is abundant and morphologically unchanged, indicating stasis under apparently stable ecological conditions. At 4 million years ago, the local environment shifts to a warm, slow, marshy swamp, and Pleurocera constantis disappears from that basin. Simultaneously, a northern, higher-elevation basin at precisely 4 million years ago preserves abundant Pleurocera constantis with the same morphology in a cool, fast-flowing river environment.\n\nSecond, infer what the coeval northern record implies. Because morphologically identical Pleurocera constantis persists elsewhere at exactly the time it vanishes locally, the species did not undergo a global extinction, nor did it necessarily evolve a new form at that time. Instead, the species is present where the ecological conditions match its prior niche, while it is absent where conditions have shifted beyond its tolerances.\n\nThird, connect mechanism to pattern. Morphological stasis in the lower and middle strata is consistent with stabilizing selection acting in a stable selective regime (cool, fast-flowing river). When the first basinâ€™s environment changes abruptly to a warm swamp, that local habitat becomes unsuitable; rather than rapidly evolving a new morphology or going globally extinct, the species remains in regions where suitable habitat still exists. This is habitat tracking (or niche conservatism with range shift), producing local extirpation in the altered basin and continued presence elsewhere with unchanged morphology.\n\nFourth, evaluate the options against the evidence:\n- Option A invokes stabilizing selection followed by extinction when change is too rapid. The presence of Pleurocera constantis at 4 million years ago in the northern basin contradicts a species-level extinction and does not explain the matched timing of local disappearance with a viable habitat still existing nearby.\n- Option B states that the species tracked its preferred habitat as climate warmed, migrating to a location that preserved its ecological requirements, thereby explaining both stasis and local disappearance. This directly matches all observations: stasis under stable conditions, disappearance coincident with local habitat loss, and coeval persistence in a suitable habitat elsewhere with identical morphology.\n- Option C relies on genetic and developmental constraints preventing adaptation, causing local extinction. While this could explain local disappearance, it fails to account parsimoniously for the simultaneous, abundant presence in a suitable habitat nearby; it also does not directly explain why stasis was observed for a million years beyond the trivial invocation of constraints when stabilizing selection plus habitat tracking already explain all features.\n- Option D posits punctuated equilibrium with an unrecorded speciation event displacing Pleurocera constantis. There is no evidence of a new, derived form displacing it in the first basin, and coeval fossils elsewhere are morphologically identical to earlier Pleurocera constantis, not a novel species.\n- Option E suggests random extinction unrelated to environment and extremely low genetic diversity. The tight temporal correlation between environmental shift and disappearance, plus coeval persistence in a matching environment, argues against randomness and against environment independence.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive and parsimonious explanation is habitat tracking with range shift, which explains stasis, local disappearance, and coeval persistence elsewhere in the preferred environment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1928046"}, {"introduction": "While some cases of stasis might be explained by geographic movement, others are the result of powerful evolutionary forces actively maintaining stability within a single population. This exercise introduces a classic mechanism for such dynamic stasis: frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of a trait depends on how common it is in the population [@problem_id:1928036]. By modeling a system of cryptic prey and different types of predators, you will quantify how this \"balancing\" selection can maintain polymorphism at a stable equilibrium, leading to long-term morphological constancy despite underlying genetic divergence.", "problem": "On a remote island, a species of arthropod, *Petrognatha stabilis*, has been observed. The fossil record indicates that its external morphology has remained unchanged for over 5 million years, a classic example of evolutionary stasis. However, recent genetic sequencing has revealed a surprising finding: the population consists of two distinct, non-interbreeding lineages, which we will call Lineage A and Lineage B. These lineages are morphologically cryptic, appearing identical to one another, except for a microscopic texture on their exoskeletons governed by a single genetic locus.\n\nThis cryptic polymorphism is maintained by intense predation from a diverse guild of birds. The fitness of each lineage is affected by both specialist and generalist predators. The dynamics can be modeled as follows:\nLet $p$ be the frequency of Lineage A and $q=1-p$ be the frequency of Lineage B. The fitness of an individual from each lineage is given by:\n- Fitness of Lineage A: $W_A = W_0 (1 - s_A - c p)$\n- Fitness of Lineage B: $W_B = W_0 (1 - s_B - c q)$\n\nHere, $W_0$ is the baseline fitness in the absence of this specific predation. $s_A$ and $s_B$ are the constant selection coefficients representing predation pressure from two different specialist bird species that have learned to identify one specific texture each. The term $c$ is the selection coefficient for a third, generalist bird species that employs apostatic selection, meaning it preferentially hunts the more common of the two lineages.\n\nThe long-term stasis of the lineage frequencies is due to a stable equilibrium arising from this frequency-dependent selection. The strength of this stabilizing effect can be quantified by a parameter $\\lambda$, representing the first-order rate of return to equilibrium. It is defined as $\\lambda = - \\frac{d(\\Delta p)}{dp}$, where $\\Delta p$ is the change in the frequency of Lineage A in one generation, and the derivative is evaluated at the stable equilibrium frequency $\\hat{p}$.\n\nGiven the following empirically determined parameters, calculate the value of the stability parameter $\\lambda$.\n\n- Specialist predation coefficient on Lineage A, $s_A = 0.08$\n- Specialist predation coefficient on Lineage B, $s_B = 0.12$\n- Frequency-dependent selection coefficient, $c = 0.20$\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the relative fitnesses absorb the common baseline factor $W_{0}$, since it cancels from the dynamics.

This evolutionary trend has primarily been achieved through an increase in body size, characterized by a length scale $L$. Consider a simplified biophysical model of this organism to investigate the physical constraints that might lead to an evolutionary stasis in this trend.\n\nThe model is based on the following principles of allometric scaling and fluid dynamics:\n\n1.  **Mechanical Power Limit ($P_{\\text{muscle}}$):** The maximum instantaneous mechanical power the organism's muscles can generate is proportional to its muscle mass. Assuming isometric scaling (i.e., the organism's shape remains constant as it grows) and uniform body density, this power scales with the cube of its characteristic length:\n    $$P_{\\text{muscle}} = C_P L^3$$\n    where $C_P$ is a constant representing the power output per unit volume.\n\n2.  **Metabolic Power Limit ($P_{\\text{supply}}$):** The maximum rate at which the organism's metabolism can supply energy to its muscles for propulsion follows a well-established allometric scaling law (similar to Kleiber's Law). This rate is proportional to the body mass raised to the power of $3/4$:\n    $$P_{\\text{supply}} = C_M L^{9/4}$$\n    where $C_M$ is a constant representing metabolic supply capacity. Note that body mass is proportional to $L^3$.\n\n3.  **Hydrodynamic Power Cost ($P_{\\text{drag}}$):** The power required to overcome the turbulent drag of water at a maximum speed $v$ is proportional to the product of the organism's cross-sectional area and the cube of its speed:\n    $$P_{\\text{drag}} = C_D L^2 v^3$$\n    where $C_D$ is a constant related to the drag coefficient and fluid density.\n\nAt any given body size $L$, the maximum achievable speed $v$ is determined by the available propulsive power, $P_{\\text{prop}}$, which is the lesser of the mechanical power limit and the metabolic power limit. This available power must equal the power cost of drag.\n\nBased on this model, a transition occurs at a critical body length, $L_{\\text{crit}}$, where the factor limiting performance switches.
