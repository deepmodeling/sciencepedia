Within the sample, a viable, unicellular, self-replicating organism is isolated. Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals it has a cell membrane and cytoplasm, but lacks a visible nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria or chloroplasts. The biologist's primary goal is to determine if this new life form belongs to the domain Bacteria, Archaea, or if it represents a novel branch of life entirely. To achieve this, the biologist plans to perform a single, decisive molecular analysis. Which of the following molecular targets would provide the most robust and informative data for placing this organism within the universal tree of life?\n\nA. The sequence of a gene found within its mitochondrial Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA).\n\nB. The chemical structure of its primary cell wall polymer.\n\nC. The gene sequence encoding the small ribosomal subunit RNA (rRNA).\n\nD. The presence or absence of genes encoding for histone proteins.\n\nE. The total number of unique types of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) polymerase enzymes it produces.", "solution": "Goal: choose a single molecular target that most robustly and informatively places an unknown, unicellular, membrane-bound but organelle-lacking organism within the universal tree of life, distinguishing Bacteria, Archaea, or a novel lineage.\n\nPrinciple of molecular phylogeny: robust deep phylogenetic placement requires a universally conserved, vertically inherited, slowly evolving informational macromolecule present in all cellular life, with conserved regions for reliable alignment across distant taxa and variable regions to resolve relationships. The canonical target that satisfies these constraints and underpins the three-domain framework is the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA in prokaryotes, 18S rRNA in eukaryotes), as demonstrated by Woese and colleagues. This marker is present in all known cellular life, encodes an essential component of the ribosome, resists horizontal gene transfer relative to many metabolic genes, and provides both conserved and hypervariable regions enabling universal primer design and phylogenetic inference across all domains.\n\nEvaluate each option against these criteria:\n\nA. A mitochondrial DNA gene requires the presence of mitochondria. The organism lacks membrane-bound organelles, so mitochondrial DNA is not expected. Even if such a gene were found, it would trace the evolutionary history of a eukaryotic endosymbiont lineage (derived from Alphaproteobacteria), not place a prokaryote-like organism or a novel lineage universally. It is therefore inapplicable and non-universal.\n\nB. The chemical structure of the primary cell wall polymer is not sufficiently robust for universal phylogeny. Bacteria often have peptidoglycan, whereas Archaea can have pseudopeptidoglycan or S-layers with diverse compositions; some Bacteria lack cell walls, and convergent or divergent evolution of wall components is common. This trait is ecological and biochemical, prone to homoplasy, and lacks the resolution and universality needed for deep phylogenetic placement.\n\nC. The gene sequence encoding the small ribosomal subunit rRNA is universal in cellular life, functionally constrained, and contains conserved and variable regions enabling multiple-sequence alignment and model-based phylogenetic inference across the tree of life. This is the standard and most informative single-locus framework for assigning organisms to Bacteria, Archaea, or Eukarya and for detecting novel deep lineages.\n\nD. Presence or absence of histone genes is not decisive. Many Archaea possess histone-like proteins; Bacteria typically lack canonical histones but have other DNA-binding proteins (for example, HU, IHF), and the distribution of histone homologs is patchy with possible horizontal transfers and convergent functional analogs. Gene presence/absence is a coarse and potentially misleading character for deep phylogeny compared to sequence-based phylogenetics of universal genes.\n\nE. The total number of RNA polymerase enzymes is not a single, definitive phylogenetic discriminator for universal placement. Bacteria have a single multi-subunit RNA polymerase; Archaea typically have one that resembles eukaryotic RNA polymerase II; eukaryotes have multiple nuclear RNA polymerases. Counting enzymes does not provide the breadth, resolution, or universality afforded by small subunit rRNA gene phylogeny and can be confounded by gene duplications, losses, or functional specialization.\n\nConclusion: the small ribosomal subunit rRNA gene sequence is the single most robust and informative molecular target for placing the organism within the universal tree of life and distinguishing Bacteria, Archaea, or a novel lineage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1975267"}, {"introduction": "The shift from a two-kingdom to a three-domain model requires us to prioritize genetic ancestry over superficial structural similarity. This problem asks you to scientifically refute the once-common idea that Bacteria and Archaea should be grouped together simply because they both lack a nucleus. Engaging with this argument sharpens your ability to differentiate between shared ancestral traits and the shared derived traits that define true evolutionary groups, reinforcing the molecular logic that places Archaea closer to Eukarya than to Bacteria.[@problem_id:1975315]", "problem": "In the mid-20th century, life was commonly classified into two major groups: Prokaryotes (organisms lacking a membrane-bound nucleus, such as bacteria) and Eukaryotes (organisms with a nucleus). This classification was based primarily on observable cellular structure. However, in the late 1970s, microbiologist Carl Woese and his colleagues proposed the three-domain system—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya—based on comparative sequencing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes.\n\nA student, looking at a diagram of a bacterial cell and an archaeal cell, argues for the older two-group system. \"Both Bacteria and Archaea are simple cells that lack a nucleus and other complex organelles,\" the student claims. \"Functionally and structurally, they are more similar to each other than either is to a complex eukaryotic cell. Therefore, they should be grouped together in a single domain, 'Prokarya', separate from Eukarya.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the strongest scientific refutation of the student's argument to group Bacteria and Archaea into a single domain based on shared lack of a nucleus?\n\n\nA. Molecular and biochemical evidence, such as the comparison of rRNA sequences and the structure of RNA polymerase enzymes, indicates that Archaea share a more recent common ancestor with Eukarya than they do with Bacteria.\n\nB. The absence of a nucleus is a symplesiomorphy (a shared ancestral character), and modern evolutionary classification aims to define monophyletic groups based on synapomorphies (shared derived characters).\n\nC. Many species of Archaea are extremophiles, capable of surviving in environments of extreme temperature, salinity, or pH, which are ecological niches not typically occupied by Bacteria or Eukarya, suggesting a distinct evolutionary history.\n\nD. Both Bacteria and Archaea possess cell walls, but the chemical composition differs, with Bacteria having peptidoglycan and Archaea lacking it. This chemical difference is the primary reason for their separation into two domains.", "solution": "1) Restate the student's claim: Bacteria and Archaea both lack a nucleus and other complex organelles; therefore, they should be grouped together. The claim relies on a shared absence of a feature and superficial cellular similarity.\n\n2) Identify the modern basis for higher-level classification: Since the late 1970s, phylogenetic relationships among major lineages have been inferred primarily from molecular sequence comparisons (notably rRNA genes) and core information-processing machinery (such as RNA polymerases, ribosomal proteins, and transcription factors), which reflect deep evolutionary history.\n\n3) State the pivotal empirical finding: Comparative rRNA sequencing and analyses of key molecular machines consistently show that Archaea form a clade that is more closely related to Eukarya than to Bacteria. This implies that grouping Bacteria and Archaea together would not reflect true evolutionary relationships and would create a non-monophyletic assemblage.\n\n4) Evaluate the options with respect to refuting the student's argument:\n- Option A directly cites the molecular and biochemical evidence (rRNA and RNA polymerase) that establishes the closer relationship between Archaea and Eukarya than between Archaea and Bacteria. This is the principal empirical basis for the three-domain system and is the strongest refutation.\n- Option B is conceptually correct: the absence of a nucleus is a symplesiomorphy, and classification emphasizes synapomorphies defining monophyletic groups. While valid, it is a methodological rationale rather than the primary empirical refutation; it supports but does not itself establish the specific relationships among the three domains.\n- Option C (extremophily) is not universal for Archaea and is an ecological trait that does not directly resolve deep phylogeny; it is weaker and not definitive for classification.\n- Option D notes a valid biochemical difference (peptidoglycan in Bacteria, not in Archaea), but it incorrectly elevates this single character as the primary reason for domain-level separation. The three-domain framework rests chiefly on broad molecular phylogenetic evidence, not just cell wall chemistry.\n\n5) Conclusion: The strongest scientific refutation is the direct molecular phylogenetic evidence that Archaea are more closely related to Eukarya than to Bacteria, which is captured by Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1975315"}, {"introduction": "Modern biology is often a computational science, especially in the field of metagenomics, where we analyze DNA from entire ecosystems at once.
