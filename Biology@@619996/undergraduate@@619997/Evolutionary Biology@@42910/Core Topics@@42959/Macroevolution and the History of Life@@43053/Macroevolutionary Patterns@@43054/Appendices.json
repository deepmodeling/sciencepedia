This exercise challenges you to apply the principle of parsimony, which favors the simplest explanation with the fewest evolutionary changes, to a real-world biological question. By mapping a key trait—complete metamorphosis—onto an insect phylogeny, you will learn how to distinguish between a single, shared innovation and multiple instances of convergent evolution, a fundamental skill in comparative biology [@problem_id:1754116].", "problem": "An entomologist is studying the evolution of different developmental strategies in insects. One of the most significant evolutionary innovations is holometaboly, or complete metamorphosis, a process involving four distinct life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This is contrasted with hemimetaboly (incomplete metamorphosis; egg, nymph, adult) and ametaboly (no metamorphosis; egg, immature, adult).\n\nThe entomologist establishes the following phylogenetic relationships based on comprehensive morphological and genetic data for a selection of insect orders:\n\n1.  The entire group of insects under study forms a monophyletic clade. The most basal lineage within this group is the order Thysanura (silverfish).\n2.  The sister group to Thysanura is a clade containing all other orders. Within this clade, the order Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) is the sister group to a large, diverse clade known as Neoptera.\n3.  The Neoptera clade is composed of two major sister clades. The first clade, which we will call Clade X, contains the orders Orthoptera (grasshoppers) and Blattodea (cockroaches). The second clade is Endopterygota.\n4.  The Endopterygota clade itself is composed of two sister clades. The first contains the orders Coleoptera (beetles) and Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps). The second contains the orders Diptera (flies) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).\n\nThe developmental modes for these orders are as follows:\n-   Thysanura: Ametabolous\n-   Odonata: Hemimetabolous\n-   Orthoptera: Hemimetabolous\n-   Blattodea: Hemimetabolous\n-   Coleoptera: Holometabolous\n-   Hymenoptera: Holometabolous\n-   Diptera: Holometabolous\n-   Lepidoptera: Holometabolous\n\nBased on this information and applying the principle of maximum parsimony (which favors the simplest explanation requiring the fewest evolutionary changes), which of the following statements most accurately describes the evolutionary history of holometaboly in this set of insects?\n\nA. Holometaboly evolved once in the common ancestor of the Endopterygota and was subsequently lost in the lineage leading to Odonata.\n\nB. Holometaboly is the ancestral trait for Neoptera, and was independently lost in Clade X (the group containing Orthoptera and Blattodea).\n\nC. Holometaboly evolved independently four separate times: once in the lineage leading to Coleoptera, once in Hymenoptera, once in Diptera, and once in Lepidoptera.\n\nD. Holometaboly evolved a single time in the common ancestor of the Endopterygota clade.\n\nE. Holometaboly was the ancestral condition for all insects in this study, and was lost in multiple lineages.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must first reconstruct the phylogenetic tree described in the problem statement and then map the trait (the presence or absence of holometaboly) onto the tree. We will then evaluate each of the proposed evolutionary scenarios (the multiple-choice options) using the principle of parsimony, which seeks the explanation with the minimum number of evolutionary events (gains or losses of the trait).\n\n**Step 1: Reconstruct the Phylogeny**\n\nThe problem describes the relationships in a nested fashion. We can represent this hierarchy using parenthetical notation, where sister groups are enclosed in parentheses and separated by a comma.\n\n-   The outermost group contains Thysanura and everything else: `(Thysanura, (...))`\n-   The sister group to Thysanura contains Odonata and Neoptera: `(Thysanura, (Odonata, Neoptera))`\n-   Neoptera contains Clade X and Endopterygota: `(Thysanura, (Odonata, (Clade X, Endopterygota)))`\n-   Clade X contains Orthoptera and Blattodea: `(Thysanura, (Odonata, ((Orthoptera, Blattodea), Endopterygota)))`\n-   Endopterygota contains two clades: one with Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, and another with Diptera and Lepidoptera. This expands to: `((Coleoptera, Hymenoptera), (Diptera, Lepidoptera))`.\n\nCombining these, the full phylogenetic tree is:\n`(Thysanura, (Odonata, ((Orthoptera, Blattodea), ((Coleoptera, Hymenoptera), (Diptera, Lepidoptera)))))`\n\n**Step 2: Map the Trait (Holometaboly)**\n\nLet's denote the presence of holometaboly with a `(+)` and its absence with a `(-)`.\n-   Thysanura: `(-)` (Ametabolous)\n-   Odonata: `(-)` (Hemimetabolous)\n-   Orthoptera: `(-)` (Hemimetabolous)\n-   Blattodea: `(-)` (Hemimetabolous)\n-   Coleoptera: `(+)` (Holometabolous)\n-   Hymenoptera: `(+)` (Holometabolous)\n-   Diptera: `(+)` (Holometabolous)\n-   Lepidoptera: `(+)` (Holometabolous)\n\nMapping this onto the tree, we see that all orders in the Endopterygota clade are `(+)`, and all orders outside this clade are `(-)`. The Endopterygota clade, `((Coleoptera, Hymenoptera), (Diptera, Lepidoptera))`, is a monophyletic group where every member shares the trait of holometaboly.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Hypothesis Using Parsimony**\n\nWe now calculate the number of evolutionary \"steps\" (gains or losses of holometaboly) required by each option. The ancestral state for all insects is assumed to be non-holometabolous `(-)` unless an option specifies otherwise.\n\n-   **Hypothesis A: Holometaboly evolved once in the common ancestor of the Endopterygota and was subsequently lost in the lineage leading to Odonata.**\n    This scenario is inconsistent with the phylogeny. Odonata is not a descendant of the Endopterygota's ancestor; it is part of an outgroup to Endopterygota. An evolutionary event in the Endopterygota lineage cannot be \"lost\" in the Odonata lineage. This hypothesis is structurally flawed.\n\n-   **Hypothesis B: Holometaboly is the ancestral trait for Neoptera, and was independently lost in Clade X (the group containing Orthoptera and Blattodea).**\n    This requires a gain of holometaboly `(-)` -> `(+)` at the base node of Neoptera. Then, it requires a loss of holometaboly `(+)` -> `(-)` in the ancestor of Clade X. This scenario requires a total of **2 evolutionary steps** (one gain, one loss).\n\n-   **Hypothesis C: Holometaboly evolved independently four separate times.**\n    This is the hypothesis of convergent evolution. It implies the ancestral state was non-holometabolous `(-)` and the trait was gained independently in the four holometabolous lineages. This requires **4 evolutionary steps** (four separate gains of `+`).\n\n-   **Hypothesis D: Holometaboly evolved a single time in the common ancestor of the Endopterygota clade.**\n    This scenario proposes that the ancestral state for the entire tree was non-holometabolous `(-)`. Then, a single evolutionary event (a gain, `(-)` -> `(+)`) occurred in the common ancestor of the Endopterygota clade. All descendants of this ancestor (Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera) inherited this trait. This scenario explains the observed distribution with only **1 evolutionary step**.\n\n-   **Hypothesis E: Holometaboly was the ancestral condition for all insects in this study, and was lost in multiple lineages.**\n    This assumes the root ancestor was `(+)`. To get the observed pattern, we would need:\n    1.  A loss in the Thysanura lineage.\n    2.  A loss in the Odonata lineage.\n    3.  A loss in the Clade X (Orthoptera + Blattodea) lineage.\n    This requires a total of **3 evolutionary steps** (three losses).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Hypotheses**\n\nLet's compare the number of steps for each plausible hypothesis:\n-   Hypothesis B: 2 steps\n-   Hypothesis C: 4 steps\n-   Hypothesis D: 1 step\n-   Hypothesis E: 3 steps\n\nThe most parsimonious explanation is the one with the fewest steps. Hypothesis D requires only one evolutionary step, making it the most parsimonious and therefore the most likely scenario based on the data. It explains the pattern of all members of the monophyletic group Endopterygota having holometaboly, while all groups outside it do not. The trait is a synapomorphy (a shared, derived character) for the Endopterygota.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1754116"}, {"introduction": "Macroevolution is often characterized by broad trends that unfold over millions of years, such as the tendency for lineages to increase in body size, a pattern known as Cope's Rule.
