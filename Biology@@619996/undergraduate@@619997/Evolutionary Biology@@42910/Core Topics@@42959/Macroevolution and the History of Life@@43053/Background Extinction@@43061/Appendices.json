This exercise demonstrates the fundamental relationship between how long a species typically persists (its duration) and the rate at which species like it go extinct. By calculating the extinction rate in the standard unit of extinctions per million species-years (E/MSY), you will learn the foundational method paleontologists use to quantify \"normal\" extinction levels over geologic time [@problem_id:1910377].", "problem": "A paleontologist is studying the evolutionary history of a large clade of marine gastropods from the Cenozoic era. By meticulously analyzing the fossil record, she has compiled data on the first and last appearances of hundreds of species within this group. Her analysis reveals that the average temporal duration of a single species, from its origination to its extinction, is approximately 4.0 million years. Assuming this average duration is representative of the steady, background rate of extinction for this clade, calculate the background extinction rate.\n\nExpress your answer in units of extinctions per million species-years (E/MSY). Round your final answer to two significant figures.", "solution": "Let $L$ denote the average temporal duration of a species, measured in million years (Myr). Under a constant background extinction process with a steady per-species hazard rate $\\mu$ (in units of per species per Myr), the time to extinction is modeled by an exponential distribution whose mean is the reciprocal of the rate. Therefore, the fundamental relationship is\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{\\mu}.\n$$\nSolving for the extinction rate gives\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{L}.\n$$\nTo express the rate in extinctions per million species-years (E/MSY), note that $1$ MSY equals $1$ species-Myr. Hence a rate of $\\mu$ per species per Myr is numerically identical to $\\mu$ E/MSY. Substituting the given average duration $L = 4.0$ Myr yields\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{4.0} = 0.25.\n$$\nRounding to two significant figures gives $0.25$ E/MSY.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.25}$$", "id": "1910377"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the historical background rate of extinction is crucial, but its true power comes from applying it to the present day. This practice allows you to translate the abstract paleontological rate of E/MSY into a tangible, expected number of extinctions for a modern group of species over a specific period [@problem_id:1910359]. This calculation is essential for conservation biology, as it provides the baseline against which we can measure the severity of current extinction events and formally assess whether we are in a sixth mass extinction.", "problem": "Paleontologists use the unit 'extinctions per million species-years' (E/MSY) to quantify long-term background extinction rates from the fossil record. The accepted historical background rate for vertebrates is estimated to be approximately 1.8 E/MSY. A conservation agency is currently monitoring the world's 68,000 known vertebrate species and wants to establish a baseline for 'normal' extinction levels over a manageable timeframe. Assuming this historical background rate is the true underlying rate of extinction, calculate the expected number of vertebrate extinctions that would occur over the next 500 years.\n\nReport your answer as a number, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We interpret 1 E/MSY as one extinction per $10^{6}$ species-years.

This hands-on practice explores one of the most critical factors: geographic distribution. Using a simplified but powerful probabilistic model, you will quantify the dramatic increase in resilience that comes from having multiple, isolated populations compared to a single, concentrated one [@problem_id:1910367]. This exercise highlights the core conservation principle that endemic species, with their limited ranges, are inherently more fragile in the face of localized threats.", "problem": "A conservation biologist is tasked with evaluating the extinction risk for two different species under a simplified model of environmental catastrophes.\n\nSpecies A is a rare amphibian, *Cryptosirens montanus*, whose entire global population of size $N_0$ lives in a single, isolated high-altitude lake.\n\nSpecies R is a small rodent, *Mundimys communis*, which has the same total global population size $N_0$. However, its population is distributed across $k$ distinct and geographically isolated mountain valleys. The population in each valley is of equal size, $N_0/k$.\n\nThe primary threat to both species is the occurrence of sudden, geographically contained environmental disasters, which we will term a Local Extinction Event (LEE). An LEE is defined as an event (such as a rockslide, flash flood, or disease outbreak) that is guaranteed to cause the complete extirpation of any population within its localized area. For any given year and any single location (i.e., the lake for the amphibian, or one of the valleys for the rodent), the probability of an LEE occurring is $p$. The occurrences of LEEs in different locations are statistically independent.\n\nAssume the total population of species R is considered extinct only if all of its $k$ subpopulations are simultaneously wiped out in the same year. For the purposes of this model, we ignore all other demographic factors like birth, death, and migration between valleys.\n\nGiven $p = 0.02$ and $k = 4$, calculate the ratio of the annual extinction probability of the amphibian (Species A) to the annual extinction probability of the rodent (Species R). The total population size, $N_0$, is 5,000 individuals.", "solution": "Define the annual extinction probability for Species A (single location) as the probability that a Local Extinction Event (LEE) occurs at its single site in a given year. By definition, for any single location, the probability of an LEE in a given year is $p$.
