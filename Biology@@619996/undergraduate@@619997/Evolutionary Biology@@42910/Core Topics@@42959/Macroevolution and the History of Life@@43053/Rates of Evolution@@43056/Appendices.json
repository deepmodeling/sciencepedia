A key quantitative trait for their survival is their 'pollutant detoxification efficiency', which is measured in detoxification units (DU). The mean detoxification efficiency for the entire population in one generation is measured to be 18.4 DU. Due to strong selective pressure from a recent increase in soil pollutants, only the most tolerant individuals successfully reproduce. The mean detoxification efficiency of these successfully reproducing beetles is found to be 23.2 DU.

The genetically determined component of an isopod's body length is controlled by a single gene with two alleles, 's' (small) and 'L' (large). The genotypic values for body length are $P_G=0$, $P_G=D/2$, and $P_G=D$ for genotypes 'ss', 'sL', and 'LL', respectively, where $D$ is a positive constant. The population is initially composed entirely of 'ss' individuals.\n\nA sudden, permanent environmental shift occurs, making larger body sizes more advantageous. The new optimal body length becomes $P_{opt} = D$. These isopods exhibit phenotypic plasticity. An individual's expressed body length, $P_E$, is a weighted average of its genetically determined length, $P_G$, and the new optimal length, $P_{opt}$. This relationship is given by the equation $P_E = (1-k)P_G + k P_{opt}$, where $k$ is the coefficient of plasticity ($0 \\le k < 1$).\n\nThe reproductive success of an isopod is related to how close its expressed body length is to the new optimum. For small deviations, the relative fitness, $W$, can be approximated by the function $W(P_E) = 1 - C(P_E - P_{opt})^2$, where $C$ is a positive constant measuring the intensity of selection. The initial rate of increase in the frequency of the 'L' allele, when it is rare, is directly proportional to the fitness difference between the heterozygote ('sL') and the resident homozygote ('ss').\n\nCalculate the ratio of the initial rate of genetic change in a population with a plasticity coefficient $k$ to the initial rate of genetic change in a non-plastic population (where $k=0$).
