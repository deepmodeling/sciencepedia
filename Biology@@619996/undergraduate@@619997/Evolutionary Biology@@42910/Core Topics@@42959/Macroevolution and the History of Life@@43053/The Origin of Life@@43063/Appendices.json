The replication process is imperfect. The probability of correctly incorporating a single monomer at any given position during the replication of a polymer is $q$, where $0 < q < 1$. An error at any position is assumed to result in a non-functional error copy. The population size is large and constant, and back-mutations from an error copy to the master sequence are considered negligible.\n\nUnder these conditions, there is a maximum length, $L_{max}$, beyond which the master sequence cannot be reliably maintained by selection and will be lost in a sea of mutations.
