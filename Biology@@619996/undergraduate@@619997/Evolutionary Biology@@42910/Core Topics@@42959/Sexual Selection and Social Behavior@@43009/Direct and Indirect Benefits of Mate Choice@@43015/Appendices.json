{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in studying mate choice is to clearly distinguish between the different types of benefits a chooser can receive. This exercise challenges you to apply the core definitions of direct (resource-based) and indirect (gene-based) benefits to several hypothetical, yet illustrative, biological scenarios. Sharpening this conceptual skill is crucial for correctly interpreting animal behavior and the evolutionary pressures that shape it. [@problem_id:1918676]", "problem": "In the study of evolutionary biology, mate choice by one sex (typically females) is a powerful driver of sexual selection. The benefits that a female gains from choosing a particular mate can be categorized into two main types:\n\n1.  **Direct Benefits**: These are advantages that directly increase the female's survival or reproductive output. Examples include access to a high-quality territory, receiving food (a nuptial gift), obtaining paternal care for offspring, or protection from predators.\n\n2.  **Indirect Benefits**: These are genetic advantages that do not directly benefit the female herself but increase the fitness of her offspring. This typically involves choosing a mate with \"good genes\" that confer higher viability or reproductive success to the next generation.\n\nConsider the following scenarios of female mate choice in four different species. Which of the following scenarios is the clearest example of a female choosing a mate based on the prospect of gaining **indirect benefits**?\n\nA. In a species of tropical frog, females preferentially mate with males that produce longer and more complex calls. Experimental studies have shown a strong correlation between call duration and the male's age. Since only males with robust health can survive to an older age in their high-predation environment, the long call serves as an honest indicator of genetic variants associated with long-term survival.\n\nB. In the satin bowerbird, females prefer males who build elaborate \"bowers\" decorated with rare, bright blue objects. A male's ability to acquire these objects is directly proportional to his dominance and control over a territory. While the bower itself is not used as a nest, males with the best bowers are less likely to be harassed by other males, allowing the female to copulate and then nest elsewhere with reduced risk of injury or forced copulation attempts.\n\nC. In a species of cichlid fish, females show a strong preference for males with prominent, bright orange spots on their anal fins. Research indicates that the female sensory system has a pre-existing bias for the color orange, as their primary food source, a small crustacean, is also orange. Males have evolved to exploit this bias, and there is no evidence that the intensity of the orange coloration correlates with the male's health, provisioning ability, or genetic quality.\n\nD. In a species of scorpion, the male performs a complex courtship dance. If the female deems the dance acceptable, the male deposits a spermatophore. Immediately after, he provides her with a captured prey item. Females are more likely to accept spermatophores from males who present larger prey items, as this food source is critical for the energetic costs of egg production.", "solution": "We begin by restating the key evolutionary principle for interpretation. Direct benefits models of mate choice posit that females gain immediate material or survival advantages from mates, such as resources, protection, or reduced risk, which directly increase the female’s fecundity or survival. Indirect benefits models (e.g., the good genes and Fisherian models) posit that females gain genetic advantages for their offspring by mating with males whose traits signal heritable viability, fecundity, or attractiveness; these benefits are realized in the next generation rather than directly by the female.\n\nThe criterion for choosing the clearest example of indirect benefits is therefore: the female’s preference should be based on a male trait that functions as an honest indicator of heritable genetic quality (good genes) or confers heritable attractiveness to offspring (Fisherian sexy sons), with no immediate material or safety advantage to the female.\n\nEvaluate option A: Females prefer males with longer, more complex calls; call duration correlates with male age; only males in robust health survive to older age in a high-predation environment; the long call is thus an honest signal of genetic variants associated with long-term survival. This directly matches the good genes model of indirect benefits: the female’s offspring are expected to inherit genes promoting viability; no direct material or safety benefits to the female are described.\n\nEvaluate option B: Females prefer males with elaborate bowers; the benefit emphasized is reduced harassment and safer copulation due to the male’s dominance and territory control; the female then nests elsewhere. This is a direct benefit (reduced risk of injury and interference), rather than an indirect genetic advantage.\n\nEvaluate option C: Females have a pre-existing sensory bias for orange; males exploit this by displaying orange spots; there is no evidence the orange intensity correlates with male health, provisioning, or genetic quality. This is sensory exploitation and does not establish indirect benefits via good genes. While Fisherian runaway can generate indirect benefits via heritable attractiveness, the prompt explicitly states no evidence of linkage to genetic quality or provisioning, and provides no evidence that sons gain mating advantages, making this not a clear example of indirect benefits compared to option A.\n\nEvaluate option D: Males provide a nuptial gift (a prey item) and females prefer larger gifts, which directly support egg production. This is a textbook direct benefit through resource provisioning.\n\nTherefore, the clearest example of a female choosing a mate for indirect genetic benefits is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1918676"}, {"introduction": "The decision to be choosy is not without its costs, often involving time, energy, and increased risk. This problem transitions from qualitative concepts to quantitative analysis, asking you to model the energetic \"budget\" of a female bird during her mate search [@problem_id:1918630]. By working through the specific trade-offs between the costs of searching and the benefits gained, we can develop a more tangible understanding of the economic decisions that underpin sexual selection.", "problem": "In a species of fictional bird, the Crimson-crested Flycatcher, a female's reproductive success is tightly linked to her net energy balance at the start of egg-laying. This pre-laying period lasts for a fixed duration of $T = 25$ days. During this time, the female must expend energy for her own survival and for the process of assessing potential mates. Upon selecting a mate, she receives a one-time \"nuptial gift\" of food, which provides a significant energy influx.\n\nThe female's daily energy expenditure for survival (basal metabolism, thermoregulation, etc.) is a constant $E_{survival} = 22.0$ kilojoules (kJ) per day.\n\nTo find a high-quality mate, the female can choose to assess several males. The process of assessing a single male requires a courtship flight and display, costing $E_{assess} = 8.5$ kJ per male assessed. The female's strategy involves assessing a new male each day until she decides to stop. The benefit of this extended search is that she is more likely to find a male who can provide a larger nuptial gift. The energy value of the nuptial gift she receives is dependent on the total number of males, $n$, that she assesses, and is described by the function:\n$$E_{gift}(n) = 110.0 + 16.0 \\cdot n$$\nwhere the energy is in kJ.\n\nConsider a female who follows a strategy of assessing exactly $N = 12$ males.

This final practice challenges you to think like an evolutionary strategist, predicting how choosiness might adapt when the availability of mates is dramatically altered. By weighing the relative importance of immediate, direct benefits against long-term, indirect genetic gains, you will explore the dynamic nature of mate choice in a world of competition and scarcity. [@problem_id:1918644]", "problem": "In a hypothetical lekking bird, the Glimmering Sandpiper (*Arenaria spectabilis*), female mate choice is a key determinant of male reproductive success. Males display at leks and possess two key traits that influence female choice. The first is a nuptial gift, a food item whose size $S$ provides direct nutritional benefits to the female, increasing her clutch size. The second is the intensity $I$ of an iridescent plumage patch, which serves as an honest indicator of the male's genetic quality (e.g., parasite resistance), providing indirect benefits to the female's offspring.\n\nAn ecological research team studies a population of these sandpipers under two distinct conditions.\n1.  **Condition 1:** The population has a naturally male-biased Operational Sex Ratio (OSR), defined as the ratio of sexually competing males to sexually receptive females. In this condition, males are abundant, and females are observed to be highly selective. They tend to only mate with males who exceed high thresholds for both gift size and plumage intensity, let's call these thresholds $S_{thresh,1}$ and $I_{thresh,1}$.\n2.  **Condition 2:** The researchers experimentally manipulate the population by removing a large number of males, creating an intensely female-biased OSR. In this condition, sexually receptive females far outnumber available males, leading to strong competition among females for mating opportunities.\n\nAssuming that female choice behavior is plastic and can adapt to environmental conditions to maximize fitness, how will the average female's mating strategy most likely change in Condition 2 compared to Condition 1? Let the new acceptance thresholds be $S_{thresh,2}$ and $I_{thresh,2}$.\n\nA. Females will become less choosy overall. Their acceptance threshold for plumage intensity will decrease significantly ($I_{thresh,2} \\ll I_{thresh,1}$), while their threshold for nuptial gift size may decrease only slightly or remain the same ($S_{thresh,2} \\leq S_{thresh,1}$). This indicates a strategic shift to prioritize immediate, direct benefits over long-term, indirect benefits.\n\nB. Females will become *more* choosy overall ($S_{thresh,2} > S_{thresh,1}$ and $I_{thresh,2} > I_{thresh,1}$). The scarcity of males will intensify selection, leading females to only accept the absolute best males available.\n\nC. Females will become less choosy overall, but they will prioritize indirect \"good genes\" benefits. Their acceptance threshold for nuptial gift size will decrease significantly ($S_{thresh,2} \\ll S_{thresh,1}$), while their threshold for plumage intensity will decrease only slightly or remain the same ($I_{thresh,2} \\leq I_{thresh,1}$).\n\nD. Female choice strategy will remain unchanged ($S_{thresh,2} = S_{thresh,1}$ and $I_{thresh,2} = I_{thresh,1}$). The aversions and preferences are genetically hardwired and do not respond to short-term changes in the OSR, leading to a large proportion of females failing to mate.\n\nE. Females will completely abandon their preference for one trait while maintaining their standard for the other. They will now only consider the nuptial gift size, mating with any male whose gift exceeds $S_{thresh,1}$, completely ignoring plumage intensity $I$.", "solution": "Define the female’s acceptance thresholds under condition $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$ as $(S_{thresh,j}, I_{thresh,j})$, and the acceptance region as $A_{j}=\\{(S,I):S\\ge S_{thresh,j}, I\\ge I_{thresh,j}\\}$. Let males arrive to a female at a Poisson rate $\\lambda_{j}$ over a finite decision window of length $T$, with $\\lambda_{2}<\\lambda_{1}$ due to the experimentally induced female-biased OSR (fewer males per receptive female).\n\nLet the joint trait distribution of encountered males be $f(s,i)$ with cumulative acceptance probability\n$$\n\\pi(S_{thresh}, I_{thresh})=\\int_{S_{thresh}}^{\\infty}\\int_{I_{thresh}}^{\\infty} f(s,i)\\, di\\, ds.\n$$\nThe probability of at least one acceptable male being encountered in the window is the standard Poisson arrival expression\n$$\np(\\lambda, S_{thresh}, I_{thresh})=1-\\exp\\big(-\\lambda T\\, \\pi(S_{thresh}, I_{thresh})\\big),\n$$\nwhich is strictly decreasing in each threshold: $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial S_{thresh}}<0$ and $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial I_{thresh}}<0$, because increasing thresholds shrinks $\\pi$.\n\nAssume direct benefits from gifts enter the female’s current fecundity as an increasing function $d(S)$, and indirect genetic benefits enter as an increasing function $g(I)$, scaled in the female’s fitness currency by a constant $\\gamma>0$ (commonly $\\gamma$ is smaller than the scale of direct effects because indirect benefits are diluted across offspring generations). The expected direct and indirect benefits conditional on acceptance are\n$$\nD(S_{thresh}, I_{thresh})=\\mathbb{E}\\big[d(S)\\mid (S,I)\\in A\\big],\\qquad\nG(S_{thresh}, I_{thresh})=\\mathbb{E}\\big[g(I)\\mid (S,I)\\in A\\big],\n$$\nwith $\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial S_{thresh}}>0$ and $\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial I_{thresh}}>0$ because raising thresholds truncates the lower tail and increases conditional means.\n\nLet $B_{0}$ be baseline fecundity.

The first term is the gain from a higher mating probability; the second is the loss from reduced average indirect benefit per mating. Similarly, a small decrease in $S_{thresh}$ yields\n$$\n\\Delta W_{S}\\approx \\left(-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial S_{thresh}}\\right)\\delta \\cdot \\Big(B_{0}+D+\\gamma G\\Big)\\;-\\; p\\left(\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial S_{thresh}}\\right)\\delta,\n$$\nwhere the second term is the loss from reduced average direct benefit per mating.\n\nNow compare Condition 2 to Condition 1. Because $\\lambda_{2}<\\lambda_{1}$, for any fixed thresholds we have $p(\\lambda_{2},\\cdot,\\cdot)<p(\\lambda_{1},\\cdot,\\cdot)$: mating opportunities are rarer. In the marginal changes above, two qualitative comparative statics follow:\n\n1) When $p$ is smaller (scarce males), the weight on the first, mating-probability term relative to the second, quality-conditional term increases, because the marginal value of securing any mating rises as encounters are rarer. Therefore, holding everything else constant, the optimal response is to relax thresholds so that $p$ increases: both $S_{thresh}$ and $I_{thresh}$ should decrease from Condition 1 to Condition 2, i.e., females become less choosy overall to avoid mating failure.\n\n2) Between traits, relaxing $I_{thresh}$ trades off mating probability against indirect benefits discounted by $\\gamma$, while relaxing $S_{thresh}$ trades off mating probability against direct, immediate fecundity gains. When mates are scarce, immediate fecundity is especially critical; thus the loss term $p\\, \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial S_{thresh}}$ is larger in fitness currency than $p\\, \\gamma \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial I_{thresh}}$ for comparable threshold relaxations. Formally, if\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial S_{thresh}} \\gg \\gamma \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial I_{thresh}},\n$$\nthen for the same $\\delta$ the net gain $\\Delta W_{I}$ exceeds $\\Delta W_{S}$. Hence it is fitness-maximizing to relax $I_{thresh}$ more than $S_{thresh}$ when $\\lambda$ decreases. Equivalently,\n$$\nI_{thresh,2}\\ll I_{thresh,1},\\qquad S_{thresh,2}\\le S_{thresh,1},\n$$\nwith the inequality for $S$ weak (a slight decrease or no change), reflecting the strategic prioritization of direct, immediate benefits over indirect, long-term genetic benefits under a female-biased OSR.\n\nThese two comparative statics jointly imply that in Condition 2 females become less choosy overall, and they relax their standard for iridescent intensity much more than for the nuptial gift size. This matches option A. Options B and D contradict plastic optimization under reduced encounter rates; option C inverts the priority of benefits; option E is an implausible corner solution that needlessly discards valuable information from one trait.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1918644"}]}
