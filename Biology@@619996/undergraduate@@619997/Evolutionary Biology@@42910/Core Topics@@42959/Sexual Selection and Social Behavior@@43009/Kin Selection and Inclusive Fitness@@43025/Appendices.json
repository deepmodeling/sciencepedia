This first exercise provides a classic \"helper-at-the-nest\" scenario, which allows for a straightforward application of Hamilton's Rule. By calculating the net change in a helper bird's inclusive fitness, you will practice quantifying the trade-off between direct fitness cost ($C$) and an indirect fitness benefit derived from helping relatives ($rB$), which is the core mechanism of kin selection [@problem_id:1942863].", "problem": "In a population of a fictional, diploid, sexually-reproducing bird species known as the Azure Song-thrush, some individuals act as \"helpers-at-the-nest.\" A particular helper individual forgoes the opportunity to produce its own single offspring in a breeding season.

This next practice problem presents a scenario where an individual helps a completely unrelated pair. Your task is to analyze the situation to determine the evolutionary mechanism at play, which forces a distinction between indirect fitness gains (from kin selection) and potential future direct fitness gains (from mechanisms like direct reciprocity). This exercise is essential for recognizing that different evolutionary pathways can lead to cooperative behavior [@problem_id:1942876].", "problem": "In a particular species of bird, the Azure Jay, suitable breeding territories are a scarce and critical resource. Some adult birds, known as \"floaters,\" do not hold a territory and thus have very low reproductive success. A floater has the option to act as a \"helper\" to an established, territorial breeding pair for a season. The floater is known to be completely unrelated to the pair it helps.\n\nIf a floater chooses to help, it incurs a cost by expending energy and forgoing the small chance of finding a low-quality territory for itself. This cost is equivalent to a loss of 0.2 offspring in terms of lifetime reproductive success ($C=0.2$). The helper's assistance in defending the nest and feeding the young increases the breeding pair's reproductive success for that season by 1.0 surviving offspring ($B=1.0$). In return for helping, the floater gains a significant advantage: if one of the territory owners dies or disappears during the year (an event with probability $p=0.4$), the floater is guaranteed to inherit the high-quality territory. A bird that possesses such a territory has an expected lifetime reproductive success of 5.0 offspring ($V=5.0$).\n\nGiven this scenario, which of the following statements provides the most accurate evolutionary explanation for the floater's helping behavior?\n\nA. The behavior is driven by kin selection. The net inclusive fitness gain for the floater is calculated as $rB - C$, where a non-zero relatedness ($r$) must be assumed, making the behavior beneficial.\n\nB. The behavior is maladaptive. The net change in the floater's lifetime fitness is -0.2, as it loses personal reproductive opportunities without gaining any indirect fitness benefits from helping the unrelated pair.\n\nC. The behavior is favored due to a form of direct reciprocity. The immediate cost to the floater is outweighed by the expected future direct fitness benefit it gains from the possibility of inheriting the territory.\n\nD. The behavior is an example of group selection. Floaters help for the good of the Azure Jay population, as the presence of helpers increases the overall number of surviving chicks and thus group viability.\n\nE. This is a case of kin recognition failure. The helping instinct evolved to aid relatives, and floaters are making an error by helping non-kin, representing an evolutionary \"trap\" for this behavior.", "solution": "Let the floater’s change in expected lifetime reproductive success from helping, relative to not helping, be given by the standard inclusive-fitness accounting. Because the floater is unrelated to the breeding pair, relatedness is $r=0$, so there is no indirect fitness gain from the breeding pair’s extra offspring. Therefore the inclusive-fitness effect reduces to a purely direct-fitness calculation.\n\nDefine:\n- $C$ as the immediate direct cost of helping in lifetime offspring units.\n- $B$ as the benefit to the breeding pair’s offspring number; this provides no indirect fitness to the floater because $r=0$.\n- $p$ as the probability that a breeder disappears, creating a vacancy that the helper inherits.\n- $V$ as the expected lifetime reproductive success associated with inheriting the high-quality territory.\n\nThe expected direct-fitness benefit to the floater from helping is the probability of vacancy times the value of inheriting the territory, i.e.,\n$$\n\\text{expected direct benefit} = pV.\n$$\nThe immediate direct cost paid by helping is $C$. Hence the net expected change in the floater’s lifetime fitness from helping, relative to not helping, is\n$$\n\\Delta W = pV - C.\n$$\nThe behavior is favored by selection when\n$$\npV - C > 0.\n$$\nGiven the parameters stated in the problem, this inequality holds, so helping yields a positive expected direct-fitness return via future territory inheritance. Because $r=0$, kin selection does not apply, and the benefit $B$ to the pair does not contribute to the floater’s inclusive fitness. Group selection is not required, nor is there a kin-recognition error. The correct interpretation is that helping is favored due to a direct future fitness benefit obtained through social queuing/pay-to-stay, which is encapsulated by option C’s description of an immediate cost outweighed by an expected future direct benefit from inheriting the territory.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1942876"}, {"introduction": "Real-world evolutionary decisions often involve uncertainty and a mix of personal and kin-directed benefits. This final exercise models a complex social dilemma in which lions must weigh the risks and rewards of forming a fighting coalition with their brothers. To determine the most advantageous strategy, you must conduct a full inclusive fitness accounting, carefully tracking how an individual's choice affects not only its own direct chance of reproduction but also that of its relatives. This problem integrates probability with kin selection theory, providing a sophisticated test of your understanding of how these principles operate in nature [@problem_id:1942873].", "problem": "A male lion, Lion A, is contemplating whether to join his two full brothers, Lions B and C, in a coalition to challenge the dominant males of a valuable nearby pride. Your task is to analyze this decision from an evolutionary perspective.\n\nAssume that fitness is measured in expected lifetime offspring equivalents.\n\n- If Lion A chooses **not** to join, he will remain a solitary nomad, and his expected fitness gain from this specific takeover opportunity is zero. In this scenario, his brothers (Lions B and C) will proceed as a two-lion coalition. A two-lion coalition has a probability of success $P_2 = 0.40$.\n\n- If Lion A chooses to **join**, a three-lion coalition is formed. A three-lion coalition is more formidable, and the probability of success increases to $P_3 = 0.70$.\n\n- In any takeover attempt, there are significant risks. Each participating lion has an independent probability of dying during the conflict, $q = 0.20$, regardless of the coalition's size or whether the attempt is successful.\n\n- A successful takeover yields a total reproductive payoff of $B_{total} = 6.0$ offspring equivalents for the victorious coalition. This payoff is shared equally among the surviving members of that coalition. Lions who die during the conflict receive a fitness payoff of zero.\n\n- Lions are a diploid species, and the coefficient of relatedness between full siblings is $r = 0.5$.\n\nCalculate the net change in Lion A's inclusive fitness if he chooses to join the coalition.
