This first exercise challenges you to distinguish \"Parental Investment\" from the related concept of \"Mating Effort.\" Correctly classifying behaviors like the mate-guarding seen in this hypothetical spider is a foundational skill for analyzing reproductive strategies in the natural world [@problem_id:1952770].", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, the allocation of resources by an organism towards reproduction is broadly categorized into two types of effort. **Parental Investment (PI)** is defined as any investment by a parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving and reproducing, at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other current or future offspring. **Mating Effort (ME)** is defined as any investment that increases an individual's number of matings or the probability that a given mating will result in offspring.\n\nConsider a hypothetical species of spider. After a male successfully mates with a receptive female and transfers his sperm, he engages in a behavior known as \"mate guarding.\" He remains in close proximity to the female, actively fending off any other rival males that approach. This guarding behavior continues until the female lays her egg sac several days later, at which point the male departs. The guarding ensures that no other male can mate with the female, thus guaranteeing his paternity of the entire clutch. The male provides no food to the female, does not help construct the egg sac, and provides no protection or resources to the eggs or the spiderlings once they hatch. His time spent guarding the female prevents him from seeking out and mating with other females.\n\nBased on the formal definitions provided, how is the male spider's mate guarding behavior best classified?\n\nA. Parental Investment\n\nB. Mating Effort\n\nC. Both Parental Investment and Mating Effort\n\nD. Female Choice\n\nE. Interspecific Competition", "solution": "We start from the formal definitions given:\n- Parental Investment (PI) is any investment by a parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving and reproducing, at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other current or future offspring.\n- Mating Effort (ME) is any investment that increases an individual's number of matings or the probability that a given mating will result in offspring.\n\nWe analyze the male spider's behavior:\n1) The male mates and then guards the female until she lays her eggs, actively preventing rival males from mating with her.\n2) This guarding does not provide resources, protection, or care to eggs or spiderlings; thus it does not directly increase offspring survival or development.\n3) The consequence of guarding is assurance of paternity for the entire clutch by preventing additional matings and thus reducing or eliminating sperm competition.\n\nWe map these consequences to the definitions:\n- For PI: The criterion is a direct increase in the survival or future reproduction of the offspring due to parental investment. In this case, the behavior does not add resources, protection, or care that improves offspring survival or condition; it only ensures that any resulting offspring are genetically his. Therefore, it does not meet the defining criterion for PI.\n- For ME: The criterion is increasing the number of matings or the probability that a given mating yields offspring attributable to the individual. Mate guarding after copulation increases the probability that the maleâ€™s mating results in offspring sired by him by preventing rival inseminations. This exactly fits the ME definition as paternity assurance increases the effectiveness of a completed mating.\n\nWe exclude other options:\n- Both PI and ME would require simultaneously increasing offspring survival (PI) and mating success or paternity assurance (ME). Only the latter applies.\n- Female choice refers to mate selection by females, not male guarding behavior.\n- Interspecific competition involves different species; here the competition is intraspecific among males.\n\nTherefore, the behavior is best classified as mating effort.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1952770"}, {"introduction": "With our definitions established, we can now explore how parental investment strategies are shaped to maximize lifetime reproductive success, especially in unpredictable environments. This problem presents a scenario involving siblicide, a seemingly grim behavior, to illustrate a profound evolutionary principle: optimal parental strategy is about maximizing the *expected* number of surviving offspring over the long term, not necessarily ensuring the survival of every individual. You will use probabilistic reasoning to determine which parental strategy yields the highest average fitness payoff [@problem_id:1952722].", "problem": "A hypothetical species of raptor, the Alpine Swift-Hawk, invariably lays a clutch of two eggs. The first chick hatches a day before the second, giving it a significant size and strength advantage. The environment these hawks inhabit has fluctuating food availability, leading to \"Good Years\" and \"Bad Years\" for raising offspring. The parents cannot predict the year's quality at the time of hatching.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist proposes a model to understand the parents' reproductive success based on two potential outcomes of the sibling rivalry in the nest. Reproductive success is measured by the expected number of chicks that survive to fledge (leave the nest).\n\nThe following parameters are defined for the model:\n- The probability of a Good Year (abundant food) is $P_{good} = 0.4$.\n- The probability of a Bad Year (scarce food) is $P_{bad} = 0.6$.\n\nWe consider two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1: Obligate Siblicide**\nThe first-hatched chick kills its sibling immediately. The parents then raise the single, remaining chick.\n- The survival probability of this single chick in a Good Year is $S_{1, good} = 0.90$.\n- The survival probability of this single chick in a Bad Year is $S_{1, bad} = 0.60$.\n\n**Scenario 2: Suppressed Siblicide**\nThe parents intervene to prevent siblicide, attempting to raise both chicks. This leads to intense competition for food between the two siblings, especially in Bad Years.\n- The survival probability *for each individual chick* in a Good Year is $S_{2, good} = 0.80$.\n- The survival probability *for each individual chick* in a Bad Year is $S_{2, bad} = 0.05$.\n\nFrom the perspective of maximizing the parents' long-term reproductive fitness, which of the following statements correctly evaluates the two scenarios?\n\nA. Suppressed Siblicide is superior, yielding an expected 0.80 fledglings per season, while Obligate Siblicide yields 0.75.\n\nB. Obligate Siblicide is superior, as the risk of total nest failure in a Bad Year under the Suppressed Siblicide scenario outweighs the potential benefit of raising two chicks in a Good Year.\n\nC. Suppressed Siblicide is superior because it offers the possibility of raising two fledglings, which is never possible with Obligate Siblicide, resulting in a higher expected number of fledglings (0.72 vs 0.70).\n\nD. Obligate Siblicide is superior because it results in a higher expected number of fledglings per season (0.72) compared to the Suppressed Siblicide scenario (0.70).\n\nE. The two scenarios are evolutionarily equivalent, as both yield the same expected number of 0.71 fledglings per season when averaged over many years.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must determine which scenario provides a higher average reproductive output for the parents over many breeding seasons. This is achieved by calculating the expected number of fledglings for each scenario. The expected value is the sum of the values of each outcome multiplied by its probability of occurrence.\n\nLet $E_{siblicide}$ be the expected number of fledglings for Scenario 1 (Obligate Siblicide), and $E_{suppressed}$ be the expected number of fledglings for Scenario 2 (Suppressed Siblicide).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the expected number of fledglings for Scenario 1 (Obligate Siblicide).**\nIn this scenario, there is only ever one chick in the nest. The expected number of fledglings is the sum of the number of fledglings in a good year multiplied by the probability of a good year, and the number of fledglings in a bad year multiplied by the probability of a bad year.\n\nThe expected number of survivors is given by:\n$$E_{siblicide} = (1 \\text{ chick}) \\times P_{good} \\times S_{1, good} + (1 \\text{ chick}) \\times P_{bad} \\times S_{1, bad}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E_{siblicide} = 1 \\times (0.4 \\times 0.90) + 1 \\times (0.6 \\times 0.60)$$\n$$E_{siblicide} = 0.36 + 0.36$$\n$$E_{siblicide} = 0.72$$\nSo, the expected number of fledglings per season under the Obligate Siblicide scenario is 0.72.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the expected number of fledglings for Scenario 2 (Suppressed Siblicide).**\nIn this scenario, the parents attempt to raise two chicks. The given survival probabilities, $S_{2, good}$ and $S_{2, bad}$, apply to *each* chick individually. Therefore, to find the expected number of survivors, we first find the average survival probability for any given chick and then multiply by the number of chicks (two).\n\nThe average survival probability for a single chick is:\n$$P(\\text{survival per chick}) = P_{good} \\times S_{2, good} + P_{bad} \\times S_{2, bad}$$\n$$P(\\text{survival per chick}) = (0.4 \\times 0.80) + (0.6 \\times 0.05)$$\n$$P(\\text{survival per chick}) = 0.32 + 0.03 = 0.35$$\nSince there are two chicks, the total expected number of fledglings is:\n$$E_{suppressed} = 2 \\times P(\\text{survival per chick})$$\n$$E_{suppressed} = 2 \\times 0.35$$\n$$E_{suppressed} = 0.70$$\nSo, the expected number of fledglings per season under the Suppressed Siblicide scenario is 0.70.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the expected values and choose the correct option.**\nWe compare the expected number of fledglings from both scenarios:\n$E_{siblicide} = 0.72$\n$E_{suppressed} = 0.70$\n\nSince $0.72 > 0.70$, the Obligate Siblicide scenario yields a higher average number of surviving offspring over the long term. This means that from a parental fitness perspective, it is more advantageous to tolerate siblicide.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. Incorrect calculations and conclusion.\nB. This statement provides a correct qualitative reason, but the problem allows for a precise quantitative comparison, which makes other options better.\nC. This option correctly identifies the possibility of raising two chicks but incorrectly reverses the calculated expected values (0.72 vs 0.70) and thus reaches the wrong conclusion.\nD. This option correctly states that Obligate Siblicide is superior and provides the correct calculated expected values for both scenarios (0.72 for Obligate Siblicide and 0.70 for Suppressed Siblicide). This is the correct answer.\nE. Incorrect calculation, leading to the false conclusion that the strategies are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the Obligate Siblicide strategy is the superior one for maximizing the parents' reproductive fitness.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1952722"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice elevates our analysis from conceptual reasoning to quantitative modeling, a powerful tool in modern evolutionary biology. Here, you will formalize the trade-off a male warbler faces between investing in his current brood (Parental Investment) and ensuring the success of a future brood (Mating Effort). By setting up and solving a fitness optimization problem, you will derive the precise allocation of time, $t_{opt}$, that maximizes the male's total reproductive fitness, demonstrating how mathematical models can generate testable predictions about animal behavior [@problem_id:1952740].", "problem": "A male migratory warbler is faced with a critical time-allocation trade-off. He has an existing brood of nestlings that he must provision with food, but his mate has also become fertile again, presenting the opportunity for a second brood. The male must decide what fraction of his time, $t$, to dedicate to mate guarding to prevent extra-pair copulations, versus provisioning his current nestlings.\n\nWe can model this decision using the following fitness framework:\n- Let $t$ be the fraction of the male's available time spent on mate guarding, where $0 \\le t \\le 1$. The remaining fraction, $(1-t)$, is spent provisioning the nestlings.\n- The fitness contribution from the current brood is dependent on the provisioning effort. This contribution is modeled as $W_p(t) = K \\sqrt{1-t}$, where $K$ is a positive constant representing the reproductive value of the current brood scaled by the effectiveness of provisioning.\n- The fitness contribution from the potential future brood depends on the male's paternity, which is threatened by rival males. His probability of paternity, $P(t)$, is modeled as a linear function of his guarding time: $P(t) = P_0 + (1-P_0)t$. Here, $P_0$ is the baseline paternity probability if he dedicates no time to guarding ($t=0$), with $0  P_0  1$.\n- The expected fitness from the future brood is thus $W_f(t) = V_f P(t)$, where $V_f$ is a positive constant representing the total reproductive value of the future brood.\n\nThe male's total fitness, $W_{total}(t)$, is the sum of the fitness contributions from both broods.
