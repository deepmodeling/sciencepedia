This exercise explores a crucial aspect of contest competition: assessment. By understanding the concept of an \"honest signal,\" which reliably communicates an individual's fighting ability, we can predict how conflicts are resolved before they even begin, saving individuals from potentially fatal encounters [@problem_id:1941095].", "problem": "In many animal species, intrasexual selection leads to contests between males for access to mates or resources. To minimize the high costs of physical combat (e.g., injury or death), many species have evolved ritualized displays involving signals that convey an individual's fighting ability. A key concept in this context is the \"honest signal,\" a trait that provides reliable information about the signaler's quality or Resource Holding Potential (RHP), which is its capacity to win a contest. For a signal to be honest, it must be costly in a way that prevents weaker individuals from cheating by displaying a high-quality signal.\n\nConsider a species of horned dung beetle where males fight over ownership of breeding tunnels. The size of a male's horn is energetically expensive to grow and is directly correlated with his physical condition and strength. Assume that for this species, horn size is a perfect, honest signal of a male's RHP.\n\nGiven this premise, which of the following scenarios is the most likely outcome when a challenger male with substantially smaller horns attempts to take over a tunnel occupied by a resident male with much larger horns?\n\nA. The small-horned challenger will assess the large-horned resident and, recognizing the high probability of losing, will retreat with little to no physical contact.\n\nB. The outcome of the fight will be essentially random (approximately 50% chance of winning for either male), as horn size is primarily for display and does not guarantee victory in a real fight.\n\nC. The small-horned challenger and the large-horned resident will engage in a prolonged, violent, and physically damaging battle to determine the true winner.\n\nD. The large-horned resident, despite its advantage, will be more likely to retreat because defending a resource is evolutionarily more costly than attempting to acquire one.\n\nE. Both males will engage in an extended series of non-contact pushing displays, with the outcome determined solely by which male has greater endurance for the display, regardless of initial horn size.", "solution": "We are told that horn size is a perfect, honest signal of a male’s Resource Holding Potential (RHP). In signaling theory and contest theory, an honest signal that perfectly reflects quality enables mutual assessment: each male can infer the opponent’s fighting ability and thus the expected outcome of escalation without engaging in costly combat.\n\nLet the challenger’s and resident’s RHP be $R_{c}$ and $R_{r}$, respectively, and assume horn size is a strictly increasing function of RHP. Because the challenger has substantially smaller horns, the premise implies $R_{c} \\ll R_{r}$. Let the value of the tunnel be $V$ and the expected fighting cost be $C>0$. Let $p_{c}=f(R_{c},R_{r})$ denote the challenger’s probability of winning in an escalated fight, with $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial R_{c}}>0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial R_{r}}<0$. Perfect honesty and a large asymmetry imply $p_{c}\\approx 0$ for the challenger when $R_{c} \\ll R_{r}$.\n\nIf the challenger escalates, its expected payoff is $p_{c}V - C$. Given $p_{c}\\approx 0$, this is approximately $-C<0$. If the challenger retreats after assessment (no or minimal contact), its payoff is the opportunity to seek another resource, which we take as strictly greater than a sure expected loss from fighting. Thus, retreat strictly dominates escalation for the low-RHP challenger under perfect information.\n\nFrom the resident’s perspective, with $R_{r}\\gg R_{c}$, the expected payoff to stand ground (even allowing for a small probability of engagement) is nonnegative and typically positive, particularly given any residency advantage or value asymmetry. Therefore, the resident does not retreat.\n\nThis logic yields the standard prediction of assessment-based contest models: when honest signals reveal a large asymmetry, contests are resolved quickly with minimal or no physical fighting, because the inferior individual withdraws. This directly supports option A.\n\nRejecting alternatives:\n- B is incorrect because perfect honest signaling implies that win probabilities are not random; the low-RHP individual anticipates a near-zero chance of success.\n- C is incorrect because prolonged, damaging fights are not favored when relative RHP is known and highly asymmetric; escalation is not an evolutionarily stable response for the inferior male.\n- D is incorrect because the high-RHP resident has no incentive to retreat; defending is less costly than fighting to acquire for the inferior male, and residency often confers an advantage, not a liability.\n- E is incorrect because when signals are perfectly honest, resolution does not depend solely on endurance displays; the known asymmetry leads to rapid retreat by the inferior male rather than extended non-contact contests.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the small-horned challenger retreats with little to no physical contact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1941095"}, {"introduction": "Competition for mates isn't always a head-to-head battle; sometimes, it’s a race against time. This scenario illustrates \"scramble competition,\" where success is determined by efficiency in locating dispersed resources, in this case, mates [@problem_id:1941118]. By applying a biophysical model of flight energetics, this problem challenges you to think like an evolutionary engineer and calculate the optimal strategy that maximizes an individual's lifetime reproductive success.", "problem": "In a species of butterfly, *Aerodryas splendidus*, females are solitary and widely dispersed throughout their forest habitat. Consequently, males engage in intense scramble competition, where reproductive success is determined by the ability to efficiently locate females. A male's lifetime reproductive success is found to be directly proportional to the total distance it can travel in search of mates before exhausting its energy reserves.\n\nAll males begin their adult life with a fixed total energy reserve, $E$. The instantaneous power, $P$, a male must expend to maintain a constant flight speed, $v$, is well-described by the biophysical model:\n$$P(v) = \\frac{k_1}{v} + k_2 v^{3}$$\nwhere $k_1$ and $k_2$ are positive constants. The first term, $\\frac{k_1}{v}$, represents the induced power required to generate lift, which dominates at low speeds. The second term, $k_2 v^{3}$, represents the parasite power needed to overcome aerodynamic drag, which dominates at high speeds.\n\nTo maximize its chances of mating, a male butterfly must adopt a flight speed that maximizes its total travel distance. Determine the optimal flight speed, $v_{opt}$, that achieves this. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $k_1$ and $k_2$.", "solution": "The goal is to find the flight speed $v$ that maximizes the total distance traveled, $D$, given a fixed initial energy reserve $E$.\n\nFirst, we must relate the total distance to the given parameters. The total flight time, $T$, is limited by the energy reserve $E$ and the power consumption rate $P(v)$. Assuming a male flies at a constant speed $v$, the power consumption is also constant. The relationship is:\n$$E = P(v) \\times T$$\nFrom this, we can express the total flight time as:\n$$T = \\frac{E}{P(v)}$$\n\nThe total distance traveled, $D$, is the product of the constant speed $v$ and the total flight time $T$:\n$$D = v \\times T$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T$, we get the total distance as a function of speed $v$:\n$$D(v) = v \\times \\frac{E}{P(v)} = \\frac{E v}{P(v)}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given expression for the power, $P(v) = \\frac{k_1}{v} + k_2 v^{3}$:\n$$D(v) = \\frac{E v}{\\frac{k_1}{v} + k_2 v^{3}}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $v$:\n$$D(v) = \\frac{E v^{2}}{k_1 + k_2 v^{4}}$$\n\nTo find the optimal speed $v_{opt}$ that maximizes the distance $D(v)$, we need to find the value of $v$ for which the derivative of $D(v)$ with respect to $v$ is zero. That is, we must solve $\\frac{dD}{dv} = 0$. Since $E$ is a positive constant, maximizing $D(v)$ is equivalent to maximizing the function $f(v) = \\frac{v^{2}}{k_1 + k_2 v^{4}}$.\n\nWe will use the quotient rule for differentiation, which states that for a function $f(v) = \\frac{g(v)}{h(v)}$, the derivative is $f'(v) = \\frac{g'(v)h(v) - g(v)h'(v)}{[h(v)]^2}$.\nHere, $g(v) = v^{2}$ and $h(v) = k_1 + k_2 v^{4}$.\nTheir derivatives are $g'(v) = 2v$ and $h'(v) = 4k_2 v^{3}$.\n\nApplying the quotient rule to $f(v)$:\n$$\\frac{df}{dv} = \\frac{(2v)(k_1 + k_2 v^{4}) - (v^{2})(4k_2 v^{3})}{(k_1 + k_2 v^{4})^{2}}$$\nTo find the maximum, we set the derivative equal to zero. This occurs when the numerator is zero, as the denominator is always positive for $v>0$.\n$$(2v)(k_1 + k_2 v^{4}) - (v^{2})(4k_2 v^{3}) = 0$$\nDistribute the terms in the numerator:\n$$2v k_1 + 2k_2 v^{5} - 4k_2 v^{5} = 0$$\nCombine the terms with $v^5$:\n$$2v k_1 - 2k_2 v^{5} = 0$$\nSince we are looking for a non-zero speed ($v > 0$), we can divide the entire equation by $2v$:\n$$k_1 - k_2 v^{4} = 0$$\nNow, we solve for $v^{4}$:\n$$k_2 v^{4} = k_1$$\n$$v^{4} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2}$$\nTaking the fourth root gives the optimal speed. Since speed must be a positive real number, we take the positive real root:\n$$v_{opt} = \\left(\\frac{k_1}{k_2}\\right)^{1/4}$$\nThis critical point corresponds to a maximum because the function $D(v)$ is zero at $v=0$ and approaches zero as $v \\to \\infty$, and is positive for all $v>0$.

Using a simple model of expected outcomes, you will determine the precise conditions under which patience becomes the evolutionarily advantageous strategy.", "problem": "In many species with intense male-male competition, such as elephant seals, a young male faces a critical life-history decision. He can either challenge a large, dominant \"harem master\" for immediate mating opportunities or wait one or more seasons to grow larger and stronger before making a challenge.\n\nConsider a simplified model for a population of male seals. A young male can adopt one of two strategies:\n\n1.  **\"Challenge Now\"**: The young male immediately confronts the dominant bull. If he wins, he sires $N$ offspring. If he loses, he is grievously injured and sires no offspring, nor will he be able to reproduce in the future. The probability of a young male winning such a confrontation is $P_Y$.\n\n2.  **\"Wait and Grow\"**: The young male forgoes the challenge for one year. There is a probability, $S$, that he survives this year of waiting. If he does not survive, he sires no offspring. If he survives, he grows into a larger, mature male. He then challenges the dominant bull. The probability of this now-mature male winning the confrontation is $P_M$. If he wins, he sires $N$ offspring. If he loses, he sires no offspring.\n\nFor the purpose of this model, assume that evolutionary advantage is determined by the strategy that yields a higher expected number of offspring. Determine the minimum annual survival probability, $S_{min}$, required for the \"Wait and Grow\" strategy to be more advantageous than the \"Challenge Now\" strategy.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must calculate the expected number of offspring for each of the two strategies and then find the condition under which the \"Wait and Grow\" strategy is superior. The expected value of an outcome is calculated by summing the products of each possible outcome's value and its probability of occurrence.\n\nLet $E_{CN}$ be the expected number of offspring for the \"Challenge Now\" strategy. There are two outcomes: winning or losing.\nThe value of winning is $N$ offspring, and its probability is $P_Y$.\nThe value of losing is $0$ offspring, and its probability is $1 - P_Y$.\nThus, the expected number of offspring for this strategy is:\n$$E_{CN} = (P_Y \\times N) + ((1 - P_Y) \\times 0) = P_Y N$$\n\nNext, let $E_{WG}$ be the expected number of offspring for the \"Wait and Grow\" strategy. This strategy involves two probabilistic events in sequence: surviving the year and then winning the challenge.\nFirst, the male must survive the year, which occurs with probability $S$. If he does not survive (with probability $1-S$), he sires 0 offspring.\nIf he *does* survive, he then challenges the dominant bull. The expected number of offspring from this challenge, conditional on survival, is calculated similarly to the first strategy, but using the mature male's probability of winning, $P_M$.\nExpected offspring after survival = $(P_M \\times N) + ((1 - P_M) \\times 0) = P_M N$.\nTo find the total expected value $E_{WG}$, we must multiply the probability of surviving the year by the expected offspring gained *after* survival.\n$$E_{WG} = S \\times (P_M N) + (1 - S) \\times 0 = S P_M N$$\n\nThe \"Wait and Grow\" strategy is more advantageous than the \"Challenge Now\" strategy when its expected number of offspring is greater than that of the \"Challenge Now\" strategy. This gives us the inequality:\n$$E_{WG} > E_{CN}$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived:\n$$S P_M N > P_Y N$$\n\nWe are asked to find the minimum survival probability $S_{min}$. We can solve the inequality for $S$. Since the number of offspring $N$ is positive (a male who wins does reproduce) and the probabilities $P_Y$ and $P_M$ are positive, we can safely divide by $P_M N$ without changing the direction of the inequality.\n$$S > \\frac{P_Y N}{P_M N}$$\n$$S > \\frac{P_Y}{P_M}$$\n\nThis inequality tells us that for the \"Wait and Grow\" strategy to be favored, the survival probability $S$ must be greater than the ratio $\\frac{P_Y}{P_M}$.
