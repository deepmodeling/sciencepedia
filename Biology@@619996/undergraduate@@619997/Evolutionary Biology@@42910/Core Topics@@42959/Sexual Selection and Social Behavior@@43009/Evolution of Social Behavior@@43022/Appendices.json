This exercise presents a classic \"helper-at-the-nest\" scenario, allowing you to practice applying the rule by quantifying the fitness costs ($C$), benefits ($B$), and the coefficient of relatedness ($r$). Mastering this fundamental calculation is the first step toward understanding the evolutionary economics of altruism in the natural world. [@problem_id:1925697]", "problem": "In a species of socially monogamous, diploid songbird, yearling individuals sometimes act as \"helpers-at-the-nest.\" A helper forgoes its own opportunity to breed for a season and instead assists its parents in raising a new brood of chicks. This helping behavior includes bringing food to the nest and defending against predators.\n\nConsider a specific scenario where a yearling helper, by assisting its parents, enables them to successfully fledge two additional chicks that would have otherwise not survived. If the helper had chosen to breed on its own, it would have produced, on average, a single offspring. Assuming the helper is a full sibling to the chicks it helps raise, determine if this altruistic behavior is favored by kin selection according to Hamilton's rule.\n\nA. Yes, because the benefit to the family group (2 chicks) is greater than the cost to the individual (1 chick).\n\nB. Yes, because the relatedness-weighted benefit is greater than the cost.\n\nC. No, because the relatedness-weighted benefit is not strictly greater than the cost.\n\nD. No, because the relatedness to siblings is too low to overcome the cost.\n\nE. It cannot be determined without knowing the survival rate of the helper's own potential offspring.", "solution": "The problem asks whether an act of altruism is evolutionarily favored according to Hamilton's rule. Hamilton's rule provides the condition under which an allele for an altruistic trait will increase in frequency in a population. The rule is expressed as the inequality:\n$$rB > C$$\n\nHere, the terms are defined as:\n- $C$ is the fitness cost to the individual performing the act (the altruist).\n- $B$ is the fitness benefit to the individual receiving the act (the recipient).\n- $r$ is the coefficient of relatedness between the altruist and the recipient.\n\nFirst, we must identify the values of $C$, $B$, and $r$ from the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Determining the cost, $C$**: The cost is the fitness lost by the helper. The problem states that by helping, the yearling forgoes producing its own single offspring. Therefore, the cost $C$ is 1.\n$$C = 1$$\n\n2.  **Determining the benefit, $B$**: The benefit is the fitness gained by the recipients due to the helper's action. The helper enables its parents to raise two additional chicks. These two chicks are the recipients of the benefit. Therefore, the benefit $B$ is 2.\n$$B = 2$$\n\n3.  **Determining the coefficient of relatedness, $r$**: The coefficient of relatedness is the probability that a gene in the altruist is an identical copy, by descent, of a gene in the recipient. The altruist is the helper, and the recipients are the two extra chicks. The problem specifies that the helper is a full sibling to these chicks. In a diploid, sexually reproducing species (like the songbird), the coefficient of relatedness between full siblings is 0.5. This is because they have a 50% chance of inheriting the same allele from their mother, and a 50% chance of inheriting the same allele from their father. The total relatedness is the sum of probabilities through each parent: $r = (0.5 \\times 0.5)_{\\text{mother}} + (0.5 \\times 0.5)_{\\text{father}} = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5$.\n$$r = 0.5$$\n\nNow we can substitute these values into Hamilton's rule:\n$$rB > C$$\n$$(0.5) \\times (2) > 1$$\n$$1 > 1$$\n\nThe inequality $1 > 1$ is false. For the altruistic trait to be favored by kin selection, the relatedness-weighted benefit must be *strictly greater* than the cost. In this case, the benefit exactly equals the cost, so there is no net selective advantage for the behavior. Therefore, the altruistic act is not favored.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n- A. Yes, because the benefit to the family group (2 chicks) is greater than the cost to the individual (1 chick). This is incorrect because it ignores the coefficient of relatedness, $r$.\n- B. Yes, because the relatedness-weighted benefit is greater than the cost. This is incorrect because our calculation shows the relatedness-weighted benefit ($1$) is not greater than the cost ($1$).\n- C. No, because the relatedness-weighted benefit is not strictly greater than the cost. This is correct. The condition $rB > C$ is not satisfied.\n- D. No, because the relatedness to siblings is too low to overcome the cost. While the conclusion \"No\" is correct, the reasoning is imprecise. The relatedness is exactly at the borderline, not necessarily \"too low\" in all contexts, but is not high enough to make the benefit strictly greater in this specific case. Option C is more precise.\n- E. It cannot be determined without knowing the survival rate of the helper's own potential offspring. The problem implicitly defines the cost in terms of successfully produced offspring (the helper \"would have produced... a single offspring\"), so this information is already accounted for in $C=1$.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1925697"}, {"introduction": "While Hamilton's rule is universal, the coefficient of relatedness ($r$) can vary dramatically across different genetic systems. This practice explores the unique case of haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), which creates unusual asymmetries in relatedness that have profound evolutionary implications.

She produces a new generation of offspring. We will focus on one of her male offspring, a drone, and one of her female offspring, a worker bee.
