{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A central challenge in evolutionary biology is disentangling the effects of genetics and environment on an organism's traits. This problem invites you to think like an experimental biologist, designing a common-garden experiment to test the genetic basis of a classic trade-off: conspicuous male coloration favored by sexual selection versus drabness favored by natural selection from predators. Mastering this experimental logic is fundamental to demonstrating the heritable nature of adaptations [@problem_id:1963804].", "problem": "In the streams of Trinidad, male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from populations exposed to high predation pressure are observed to be significantly less colorful than males from populations in low-predation environments. This observation has led to the hypothesis that male coloration is the result of an evolutionary trade-off: sexual selection from female choice favors more colorful males, while natural selection from predators favors less conspicuous, drabber males.\n\nA biologist aims to investigate whether the observed difference in coloration between these two types of populations has a genetic basis, as opposed to being a direct, plastic response to the presence or absence of predators. To do this, the biologist conducts a common-garden experiment. They collect a sample of guppies from a high-predation stream and another sample from a low-predation stream. These fish are used to establish breeding colonies in a laboratory. The offspring from both populations are then raised from birth to maturity in identical, predator-free aquaria, ensuring that all environmental factors, such as food availability, water-quality, and social density, are kept constant for both groups.\n\nWhich of the following potential outcomes of this experiment would provide the strongest evidence that the differences in male coloration observed in the wild are genetically determined?\n\nA. Males raised from the high-predation population are, on average, less colorful and have fewer spots than males raised from the low-predation population.\n\nB. Males raised from both populations develop coloration that is, on average, equally bright and conspicuous.\n\nC. Males raised from the high-predation population are, on average, more colorful and have more spots than males raised from the low-predation population.\n\nD. The survival rate to maturity is significantly higher for the offspring from the low-predation population than for the offspring from the high-predation population.\n\nE. When a simulated predator is introduced into the aquaria, the males from the high-predation stock are better at avoiding capture than the males from the low-predation stock.", "solution": "The core purpose of a common-garden experiment is to separate the effects of genetic inheritance from the effects of environmental influences on an organism's traits. By raising individuals from different populations in an identical (common) environment, any persistent differences observed between the groups can be attributed to their genetic makeup, as the environmental variables have been controlled and are the same for all individuals.\n\nThe hypothesis being tested is that the difference in coloration between high-predation and low-predation guppy populations is genetically based. The initial observation from the wild is that males from high-predation environments are less colorful. If this trait difference is genetic, it should persist in their offspring even when the selective pressure (predation) is removed.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. Males raised from the high-predation population are, on average, less colorful and have fewer spots than males raised from the low-predation population.**\nThis outcome shows that the difference in coloration observed in the wild is maintained in the offspring even when they are raised in a completely identical, predator-free environment. Since the environment is controlled, the only variable that differs between the two groups is their genetic ancestry. Therefore, this result strongly supports the conclusion that the variation in coloration is genetically determined. The offspring inherited the genes for being \"less colorful\" (from the high-predation population) and \"more colorful\" (from the low-predation population) from their parents.\n\n**B. Males raised from both populations develop coloration that is, on average, equally bright and conspicuous.**\nThis outcome would suggest that the differences in coloration are not genetic but are instead an example of phenotypic plasticity. It would imply that in the wild, the presence of predators directly causes males to develop drabber colors, and in their absence, all males have the potential to be colorful. When the environmental cue (predator presence) is removed for both groups, the difference disappears. This would be strong evidence *against* a genetic basis.\n\n**C. Males raised from the high-predation population are, on average, more colorful and have more spots than males raised from the low-predation population.**\nThis result, a reversal of the pattern observed in the wild, would be perplexing. While it indicates that there is a genetic difference between the populations (as they respond differently to the same environment), it directly contradicts the initial observation and the evolutionary trade-off hypothesis being tested. It would not be the *strongest evidence* supporting the hypothesis that the specific differences *seen in the wild* are genetic; instead, it would suggest a more complex gene-by-environment interaction that was not previously understood. Therefore, it is not the best answer.\n\n**D. The survival rate to maturity is significantly higher for the offspring from the low-predation population than for the offspring from the high-predation population.**\nThis option describes a difference in fitness (viability) between the two populations in the lab environment. While this is an interesting result, it does not directly address the question about the genetic basis of *male coloration*. The focus of the experiment is on the specific trait of ornamentation, not general survival.\n\n**E. When a simulated predator is introduced into the aquaria, the males from the high-predation stock are better at avoiding capture than the males from the low-predation stock.**\nThis finding would provide evidence for a genetic basis for *anti-predator behavior*, not coloration. It shows that the population with a history of predation has genetically-based adaptations for survival. However, like option D, it does not answer the specific question about the genetic underpinnings of coloration.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only outcome that directly and strongly supports the hypothesis that the observed differences in coloration between the wild populations are heritable and genetically determined.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1963804"}, {"introduction": "Sexual selection often acts differently on males and females, a concept formalized by Bateman's principle, which states that male reproductive success is typically limited by access to mates while female success is limited by resources. This exercise challenges you to apply this principle by predicting how changing the mating landscape affects the statistical variance in reproductive success for each sex. By working through this scenario, you'll sharpen your ability to translate a foundational evolutionary theory into a testable, quantitative hypothesis about population-level patterns [@problem_id:1963841].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying reproductive strategies in a laboratory population of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*. In a control group under standard conditions, the number of offspring produced by each individual over its lifetime is measured. The statistical analysis of this data reveals that the variance in reproductive success for males is $V_{male-control} = 10.0$, and for females, it is $V_{female-control} = 2.0$.\n\nNext, a new, identical population of fruit flies is placed in a \"High-Opportunity\" environment. In this setup, the population density is managed such that every individual, both male and female, has access to a significantly larger number of potential mates throughout their reproductive lifespan compared to the control group. All other conditions, such as food availability and temperature, are kept identical to the control experiment.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of sexual selection, which of the following pairs of values represents the most likely new variances in reproductive success for males ($V'_{male}$) and females ($V'_{female}$) in the High-Opportunity group?\n\nA. $V'_{male} = 5.0$, $V'_{female} = 1.0$\n\nB. $V'_{male} = 10.5$, $V'_{female} = 12.0$\n\nC. $V'_{male} = 25.0$, $V'_{female} = 2.5$\n\nD. $V'_{male} = 15.0$, $V'_{female} = 12.0$\n\nE. $V'_{male} = 2.0$, $V'_{female} = 10.0$", "solution": "This problem requires an understanding of Bateman's principle, a foundational concept in the study of sexual selection. The principle posits that the reproductive success of the sexes can be limited by different factors.\n\nStep 1: Understand the limiting factors for reproductive success in each sex.\nFor most species, including *Drosophila melanogaster*, males invest primarily in producing sperm, which is metabolically inexpensive. Their reproductive success is therefore typically limited by the number of different females they can successfully mate with. In contrast, females invest heavily in producing large, nutrient-rich eggs and, in some species, parental care. Their reproductive success is limited not by the number of mates they can acquire, but by the physiological and energetic resources required to produce eggs and/or raise offspring.\n\nStep 2: Relate limiting factors to reproductive variance.\nBecause male reproductive success is limited by access to mates, there is a high potential for variance. A few desirable or dominant males may secure a very large number of matings, leading to high reproductive success, while many other males may fail to mate at all, resulting in zero reproductive success. This large spread between the \"winners\" and \"losers\" creates high variance.\n\nFemale reproductive success, being limited by resources and physiology, tends to have lower variance. A female can only produce a finite number of eggs in her lifetime, regardless of how many males she mates with. While there will be some variation among females due to differences in health and resource acquisition, it is generally much smaller than the variation seen in males. The initial data supports this, with $V_{male-control} = 10.0$ being significantly higher than $V_{female-control} = 2.0$.\n\nStep 3: Predict the effect of the \"High-Opportunity\" environment.\nThe experiment increases the number of available mates for both sexes. We must consider how this change affects the limiting factor for each sex.\n\nFor males, their primary limiting factor (access to females) is now less constrained in a general sense, but the competition to be chosen by those females is likely to intensify. With more opportunities, the most successful males can achieve even greater reproductive success than in the control group. The disparity between these highly successful males and the males who still fail to mate will widen significantly. Therefore, the variance in male reproductive success ($V'_{male}$) is expected to increase substantially.\n\nFor females, the situation is different. Their reproductive success is still limited by their capacity to produce eggs. Having access to more males does not significantly increase this capacity. A female who mates with ten males is unlikely to produce significantly more offspring than a female who mates with two. Thus, the change in mating opportunity is not expected to have a major impact on the variance in female reproductive success. We predict $V'_{female}$ will remain relatively stable, perhaps with a very slight increase, but certainly not a large one.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given options based on the prediction.\nOur prediction is that $V'_{male}$ will be much larger than $V_{male-control}$ (10.0), and $V'_{female}$ will be close to $V_{female-control}$ (2.0).\n\nA. $V'_{male} = 5.0$, $V'_{female} = 1.0$: Both variances decrease. This is contrary to our prediction for males.\nB. $V'_{male} = 10.5$, $V'_{female} = 12.0$: Male variance barely increases, while female variance increases dramatically. This contradicts Bateman's principle.\nC. $V'_{male} = 25.0$, $V'_{female} = 2.5$: Male variance increases substantially (from 10.0 to 25.0), while female variance remains relatively stable (increasing only slightly from 2.0 to 2.5). This outcome perfectly aligns with our prediction based on sexual selection theory.\nD. $V'_{male} = 15.0$, $V'_{female} = 12.0$: Both variances increase significantly. The large increase in female variance is not expected.\nE. $V'_{male} = 2.0$, $V'_{female} = 10.0$: This option swaps the initial variances, which is biologically nonsensical in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible outcome is the one that shows a large increase in the variance of male reproductive success and a minimal change in the variance of female reproductive success.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1963841"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary outcomes are not always fixed; sometimes, the best strategy depends on what everyone else is doing. This problem introduces the powerful framework of evolutionary game theory to analyze 'penis fencing' in hermaphroditic flatworms, a dramatic example of sexual conflict. By calculating the evolutionarily stable frequency of different behaviors, you will learn how to model the evolution of complex social and sexual interactions where fitness is frequency-dependent [@problem_id:1963815].", "problem": "Certain species of simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworms, such as *Pseudobiceros hancockanus*, engage in a behavior known as \"penis fencing.\" When two individuals meet, they compete to inseminate one another. The individual that successfully inseminates the other acts in the \"male\" role, siring offspring with a relatively low energetic investment. The inseminated individual must act in the \"female\" role, which involves bearing and provisioning the eggs, a significantly more costly endeavor.\n\nConsider a simplified model of this interaction within a large population of such flatworms. When two individuals encounter each other, each can adopt one of two behavioral strategies: \"Escalate\" or \"Concede\".\n\nThe fitness payoffs for these interactions are defined as follows:\n- If an \"Escalate\" strategist meets another \"Escalate\" strategist, they engage in a prolonged duel. Both individuals incur a fitness cost $C_d$ from the duel itself. The outcome is random, so each has a 50% chance of winning (acting as male) and a 50% chance of losing (acting as female).\n- If an \"Escalate\" strategist meets a \"Concede\" strategist, the Escalator automatically wins and acts as male, while the Conceder immediately loses and acts as female. No duel occurs, so the cost $C_d$ is not paid by either individual.\n- If two \"Concede\" strategists meet, they do not fight. The roles are assigned randomly, with each having a 50% chance of being male or female. No duel occurs.\n\nThe fitness benefit from successfully siring offspring (the male role) is $V$. The fitness cost of bearing offspring (the female role) is $C_f$. Assume that $C_f > V > 0$, and that the duel cost $C_d$ is also positive. All costs and benefits are measured in units of reproductive fitness.\n\nThe population has reached an evolutionarily stable state where both the \"Escalate\" and \"Concede\" strategies coexist at specific, stable frequencies.
