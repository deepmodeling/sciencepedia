Any evolutionary process requires raw material to act upon, and sexual selection is no exception. This first exercise challenges you to identify the two most fundamental prerequisites—the non-negotiable elements that must be present in a population for the self-reinforcing feedback loop of runaway selection to even begin [@problem_id:1929091].", "problem": "A population biologist is developing a simple genetic model to simulate Fisherian runaway selection in a hypothetical species of fish. The model considers two unlinked genetic loci.\n\nThe first locus, the \"Trait\" locus, controls a male-specific ornamental trait. It has two alleles: allele $T$ results in a conspicuously large fin, while allele $t$ results in a small, less conspicuous fin. The large fin expressed by allele $T$ incurs a direct survival cost, making males with this allele more susceptible to predation.\n\nThe second locus, the \"Preference\" locus, is expressed in females. It has two alleles: allele $P$ causes females to have a strong mating preference for males with the large fin trait, while allele $p$ results in no preference, with females mating randomly with respect to fin size.\n\nThe simulation aims to track allele frequencies from an initial state. For the process of runaway selection to begin—that is, for the frequency of the costly $T$ allele to have the potential to increase in the population driven by the female preference—the initial population must be defined by certain characteristics.\n\nWhich of the following pairs of quantities must both be non-zero in the initial population for Fisherian runaway to be possible?\n\nA. The survival cost associated with the $T$ allele; The genetic variation for the preference trait.\n\nB.

The total population size; The strength of the female preference.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the two essential preconditions that must be met in an initial population for Fisherian runaway selection to be possible. Fisherian runaway is an evolutionary process where a female preference for a certain male trait can drive the evolution of that trait to an exaggerated, often costly, state. Let's analyze the core mechanism.\n\n1.  **The Engine of Selection:** Evolution by selection—whether natural or sexual—fundamentally requires heritable variation in a trait that affects fitness (survival or reproduction). If there is no variation, there are no differences upon which selection can act, and the population cannot evolve.\n\n2.  **Requirement 1: Variation in the Male Trait:** The process involves selection acting on a male trait (fin size, in this case). For selection to favor or act against the large fin ($T$) allele, there must be different types of males in the population. Some males must have large fins ($T$) and some must have small fins ($t$). If the entire population were fixed for the $t$ allele (all small fins), there would be no large-finned males for even the most discerning females to choose. Conversely, if the population were fixed for the $T$ allele (all large fins), female preference would be irrelevant as all potential mates possess the trait. Therefore, there must be **genetic variation for the male trait**. In population genetics, genetic variance at a diploid locus with allele frequencies $p_T$ and $p_t$ is proportional to $p_T p_t$. This product is non-zero only if both $p_T$ and $p_t$ are greater than zero (i.e., $0 < p_T < 1$).\n\n3.  **Requirement 2: Variation in Female Preference:** The driving force of the runaway process is sexual selection imposed by females. This selection is not uniform across all females; it is specifically the $P$ females (those with the preference) that create a reproductive advantage for $T$ males. If all females in the population had no preference (fixed for the $p$ allele), $T$ males would gain no mating advantage, and their allele frequency would decline due to the survival cost. If all females in the population already had the preference (fixed for the $P$ allele), there would be a strong selective pressure on males, but the preference trait itself could not evolve further. The core of the \"runaway\" feedback loop is that the preference allele $P$ \"hitchhikes\" with the successful trait allele $T$ (because females with preference $P$ tend to have \"sexy sons\" with allele $T$, who will be chosen by the next generation of $P$ females). This co-evolutionary dynamic requires that both preference alleles, $P$ and $p$, exist in the population, allowing the frequency of $P$ to change in response to the selection it generates. Thus, there must be **genetic variation for the female preference**. Similar to the trait, this means the frequencies of both $P$ and $p$ must be between 0 and 1.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A. The survival cost associated with the $T$ allele; The genetic variation for the preference trait.** While survival cost is part of the model, runaway can hypothetically begin even with a zero or negligible cost. The cost determines the *net* direction of selection, but its existence is not a precondition for the sexual selection component to operate. Therefore, non-zero survival cost is not a necessary precondition.\n    *   **B. The strength of the female preference; The genetic covariance between the trait and preference alleles.** The genetic covariance (or linkage disequilibrium) is a *consequence* of the assortative mating in the runaway process, not a precondition. It typically starts at or near zero and builds up as $P$ females mate with $T$ males, creating an association between the $P$ and $T$ alleles in their offspring. The process can start without initial covariance.\n    *   **C. The initial frequency of the $T$ allele; The initial frequency of the $p$ allele.** Having a non-zero frequency of $T$ and $p$ is necessary, but this statement is incomplete. For variation to exist, you also need non-zero frequencies of their counterparts, $t$ and $P$. This option only names one allele at each locus, not the overall variation.\n    *   **D. The genetic variation for the male trait; The genetic variation for the female preference.** This pair correctly identifies the two fundamental requirements. As explained in points 2 and 3, selection cannot operate without variation in the trait it acts upon (the male fin) and variation in the source of that selection (the female preference).\n    *   **E. The total population size; The strength of the female preference.** Population size affects the strength of genetic drift, and preference strength is a key parameter, but neither is a fundamental precondition in the same way as genetic variation. The process can be modeled deterministically (infinite population) and can begin even with weak preference, as long as the necessary genetic variations are present.\n\nTherefore, the two essential quantities that must be non-zero for the process to begin are the genetic variation in the male trait and the genetic variation in the female preference.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1929091"}, {"introduction": "With the necessary ingredients of genetic variation in place, we can now model the engine of change itself. This practice provides a quantitative look at how female preference directly translates into changes in allele frequencies in the next generation. By working through this hypothetical scenario, you will calculate the precise impact of sexual selection on the gene pool, making the abstract concept of runaway a concrete, predictable process [@problem_id:1929155].", "problem": "In a species of fictional bird known as the Azure Whistler, the complexity of a male's song is determined by a single genetic locus $T$. The dominant allele $T$ results in a complex song, while the recessive allele $t$ results in a simple song. In the same population, female mating preference is determined by a different, unlinked locus $P$. The dominant allele $P$ causes a female to prefer males with complex songs, while the recessive allele $p$ results in no preference (i.e., random mating).\n\nThe key aspect of this system is that the song trait is purely ornamental. The alleles $T$ and $t$ have no effect whatsoever on a male's survival, foraging ability, or any other aspect of his viability. Likewise, the alleles $P$ and $p$ have no effect on female viability. The probability of any individual surviving to reproductive age is uniform across all genotypes at both loci.\n\nSexual selection, however, is at play. Females with the non-preferring $pp$ genotype mate randomly with all males in proportion to their frequency in the population. Females with a preferring genotype ($PP$ or $Pp$) are three times more likely to mate with a complex-song male ($TT$ or $Tt$) than with a simple-song male ($tt$).\n\nConsider an infinitely large population that is initially in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for both loci.

This final practice presents a classic ecological thought experiment to explore this crucial trade-off. By considering the introduction of a new predator, you will analyze how sexual selection and natural selection can push and pull on a trait, ultimately shaping its evolution toward a new equilibrium point [@problem_id:1929129].", "problem": "On a remote, forested island, a species of bird known as the Cerulean Sun-Bird exhibits a classic example of a sexually selected trait. The males possess exceptionally long, vibrant blue tail feathers, often exceeding twice their body length. The evolution of this trait has been driven by strong female preference for the longest and most brilliant tails, a process consistent with a Fisherian runaway selection model. This has resulted in a genetic correlation where females who prefer long tails tend to have sons with long tails and daughters who also prefer long tails. The island has historically been free of significant aerial predators.\n\nA new species of hawk, a highly agile and visually acute predator, successfully colonizes the island. The hawk primarily hunts by spotting prey from the air, making conspicuous birds much more vulnerable. Assume the hawk becomes the primary source of mortality for the adult Sun-Birds.\n\nGiven this new, intense pressure from natural selection, which of the following describes the most likely evolutionary trajectory for the male Cerulean Sun-Bird's tail over many generations?\n\nA. The tail feathers will become even longer and more brilliant, as males with the most extreme traits are better able to signal their superior genetic quality, which now includes the ability to survive despite the handicap and the new predator.\n\nB. The population will undergo disruptive selection, splitting into two distinct male morphs: one with very short, cryptic tails to evade predators and another with the original, extremely long tails that continues to attract females.\n\nC. The average length and vibrancy of the tail feathers will decrease, settling at a new, shorter equilibrium length where the benefit of attracting mates is balanced by the severe cost of increased predation risk.\n\nD. The male tail trait will remain unchanged because the genetic linkage between the female preference and the male trait is too strong to be broken by the new selection pressure.\n\nE. Both the male tail-length trait and the female preference for it will be completely eliminated from the population, as any expression of the trait leads to certain death.", "solution": "First, identify the forces driving the male tail trait before the predator arrives. Under Fisherian runaway sexual selection, a genetic covariance between a male trait (tail length, denote it by $t$) and a female preference for that trait (denote it by $p$) causes positive frequency-dependent selection: females preferring larger $t$ have sons with larger $t$ and daughters with larger $p$, increasing mating success for long-tailed males. In a context with negligible viability cost (historically few predators), the net selection gradient on $t$ is positive, pushing $t$ to large values.\n\nSecond, incorporate the new viability selection imposed by an aerial visual predator. Let total fitness factor into multiplicative components,\n$$\nW(t,p) = M(t,p)\\,V(t),\n$$\nwhere $M(t,p)$ increases with $t$ for a given $p$ (sexual selection) and $V(t)$ decreases with $t$ because conspicuous, long tails increase predation risk (natural selection). The selection gradient on $t$ is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln W}{\\partial t} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial \\ln M}{\\partial t} \\;+\\; \\frac{\\partial \\ln V}{\\partial t}.\n$$\nAn evolutionary equilibrium tail length $t^{*}$ (given standing genetic variance) requires\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\ln W}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=t^{*}} \\;=\\; 0 \\;\\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\;\\; \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\ln M}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=t^{*}} \\;=\\; -\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\ln V}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=t^{*}}.\n$$\nThe arrival of the hawk steepens the viability cost of conspicuousness, making $\\partial \\ln V/\\partial t$ more negative across $t$. Consequently, to reestablish the balance, $t^{*}$ must shift downward so that the marginal mating advantage of increasing $t$ is reduced to match the now larger marginal viability penalty. Thus, the new equilibrium has a shorter and less vibrant tail than before.\n\nThird, consider dynamical consequences for the preference $p$. Because the trait and preference are genetically correlated, correlated selection from viability costs on $t$ feeds back on $p$; both $t$ and $p$ tend to decline toward a joint equilibrium, rather than remaining fixed. However, unless predation causes near-certain mortality for any expression of the trait, sexual selection does not vanish entirely; instead, a balance is reached at finite, reduced values.\n\nFourth, evaluate the options:\n- Option A is unlikely because the increased viability cost from a visually hunting predator makes additional exaggeration of $t$ maladaptive; the handicap does not generally increase when viability selection becomes much stronger, but instead the equilibrium shifts to smaller $t$.\n- Option B requires disruptive selection, which would need the combined fitness landscape to favor extremes over intermediates. Here, $M(t,p)$ is increasing in $t$ while $V(t)$ is decreasing in $t$; their product typically yields a single-peaked fitness function in $t$, implying stabilizing selection toward an intermediate (now lower) optimum, not a stable polymorphism of very long and very short tails.\n- Option C correctly states that the mean tail will decrease and settle at a new equilibrium where the marginal mating benefit equals the heightened marginal predation cost.\n- Option D is incorrect because genetic correlation does not prevent response to selection; strong viability selection will shift both $t$ and $p$.\n- Option E overstates the effect; the problem states the hawk is the primary mortality source but does not imply certain death for any expression of the trait. Complete elimination of both trait and preference is not the general expectation; rather, a reduced equilibrium is.\n\nTherefore, the most likely evolutionary trajectory is a decrease in average tail length and vibrancy to a new, shorter equilibrium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1929129"}]}
