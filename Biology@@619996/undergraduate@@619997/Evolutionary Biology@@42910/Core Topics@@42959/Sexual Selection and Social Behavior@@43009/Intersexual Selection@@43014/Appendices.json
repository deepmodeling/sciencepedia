{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A central question in the study of intersexual selection is understanding the motivation behind a female's choice. Does she choose a mate for the immediate resources he provides, such as a better territory or food supply (direct benefits)? Or is she selecting him for the superior genes he will pass on to her offspring, conferring higher viability or health (indirect benefits)? This practice challenges you to think like an experimental biologist by interpreting the results of a hypothetical cross-fostering experiment, a powerful technique used to separate environmental effects from genetic ones [@problem_id:1940859].", "problem": "In a species of songbird, the Satin Bowerbird, females are observed to preferentially mate with males that defend territories rich in a specific type of berry. These berries are the primary food source for the nestlings. An evolutionary biologist proposes two competing hypotheses to explain this female preference.\n\nHypothesis 1 (Direct Benefits): Females choose males with berry-rich territories because the superior food supply directly increases the survival and growth of their offspring. The male's quality as a genetic parent is not the primary factor.\n\nHypothesis 2 (Indirect Benefits or \"Good Genes\"): The ability to acquire and defend a berry-rich territory is an honest indicator of a male's superior genetic makeup (e.g., better health, vigor, or cognitive ability). Females choose these males to pass these \"good genes\" on to their offspring, thereby increasing the offspring's intrinsic viability, independent of the environment.\n\nTo distinguish between these two hypotheses, a cross-fostering experiment is conducted. A large number of eggs are collected from nests in both high-quality (berry-rich) and low-quality (berry-poor) territories. The eggs are then randomly redistributed: half of the eggs from high-quality territory fathers are placed in nests within low-quality territories to be raised by foster parents, and vice-versa. The survival of the hatchlings is monitored until they fledge.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would provide the strongest evidence in support of the \"Good Genes\" hypothesis?\n\nA. The survival rate of offspring is significantly higher for those sired by males from high-quality territories, regardless of the quality of the territory in which the offspring were raised.\n\nB. The survival rate of offspring is significantly higher for those raised in high-quality territories, regardless of the genetic father's territory quality.\n\nC. The survival rate of offspring is highest when the biological father's territory quality matches the foster parents' territory quality (i.e., high-high or low-low) and lowest when they are mismatched.\n\nD. The physical condition of the female parent at the end of the breeding season is significantly better for females who mated with males on high-quality territories compared to those who mated with males on low-quality territories, independent of where their eggs were fostered.", "solution": "The core of the problem is to identify an experimental result that decouples the genetic contribution of the father from the environmental contribution of the territory he holds. The cross-fostering experiment is designed to achieve exactly this separation. Let's analyze the two hypotheses and how the experimental outcomes relate to them.\n\n**Hypothesis 1: Direct Benefits**\nThis hypothesis posits that the environment (the territory) is the key factor determining offspring success. The male himself is just a provider of this environment. If this hypothesis is true, offspring survival should be tightly linked to the quality of the territory where they are raised, because that's where they get their resources (food, protection). The identity of their biological father should be irrelevant.\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Indirect Benefits (\"Good Genes\")**\nThis hypothesis posits that the father's genetic quality is the key factor. The territory is merely an honest signal of this underlying genetic quality. If this hypothesis is true, the genes inherited from the father should confer a survival advantage to the offspring, regardless of the environment they are raised in. Offspring sired by \"high-quality\" males should do better than offspring sired by \"low-quality\" males, even if they are both raised in identical environments.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on this framework.\n\n**Option A:** \"The survival rate of offspring is significantly higher for those sired by males from high-quality territories, regardless of the quality of the territory in which the offspring were raised.\"\nThis outcome shows that offspring survival is correlated with the *biological father's* characteristics (his ability to hold a high-quality territory) and not with the *rearing environment*. For example, a chick sired by a male from a high-quality territory but raised in a low-quality territory still has a higher survival rate than a chick sired by a male from a low-quality territory but raised in that same low-quality territory. This directly supports the idea that the father is passing on \"good genes\" that increase intrinsic viability. This is strong evidence for the \"Good Genes\" hypothesis.\n\n**Option B:** \"The survival rate of offspring is significantly higher for those raised in high-quality territories, regardless of the genetic father's territory quality.\"\nThis outcome shows that the rearing environment is the determining factor for survival. A chick raised in a high-quality territory does well, and a chick raised in a low-quality territory does poorly, irrespective of who their father was. This result would mean the benefits are resource-based and not genetic. This is strong evidence for the \"Direct Benefits\" hypothesis, and thus contradicts the \"Good Genes\" hypothesis.\n\n**Option C:** \"The survival rate of offspring is highest when the biological father's territory quality matches the foster parents' territory quality (i.e., high-high or low-low) and lowest when they are mismatched.\"\nThis result suggests a complex gene-by-environment interaction. It implies that genes from a \"high-quality\" father are only advantageous in a high-quality environment, and genes from a \"low-quality\" father are somehow better adapted to a low-quality environment. While interesting, this outcome does not provide clear and unambiguous support for the simple \"Good Genes\" hypothesis, which predicts a general, environment-independent advantage for genes from high-quality males.\n\n**Option D:** \"The physical condition of the female parent at the end of the breeding season is significantly better for females who mated with males on high-quality territories compared to those who mated with males on low-quality territories, independent of where their eggs were fostered.\"\nThis option focuses on the *female's* condition, not the *offspring's* survival. While a healthier female might indicate she received direct benefits (like less stress or more food for herself) from a male on a good territory, it doesn't test the \"Good Genes\" hypothesis, which is fundamentally about the fitness of the *offspring* due to the genes they inherit. The question asks for evidence supporting the \"Good Genes\" hypothesis as it pertains to offspring viability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is the only outcome that demonstrates a clear, environment-independent survival advantage conferred by the genetic father, which is the central prediction of the \"Good Genes\" hypothesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1940859"}, {"introduction": "Once indirect genetic benefits are suspected, the next question is what kind of genetic advantage is being conferred. The 'good genes' hypothesis suggests the offspring inherit genes for higher survival, while the 'sexy son' hypothesis proposes they simply inherit the genes for attractiveness itself, ensuring their own future mating success. This thought experiment asks you to analyze the outcomes of a more nuanced cross-fostering study, focusing on how measuring both offspring viability and their subsequent mating success can help distinguish between these two key mechanisms of sexual selection [@problem_id:1940883].", "problem": "In a species of fictional bird, the Crimson-Throated Warbler, males possess elongated, ornamental tail feathers. Extensive observation has shown that females consistently prefer to mate with males that have the longest tails. Two major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of this female preference via intersexual selection: the \"good genes\" hypothesis and the \"sexy son\" hypothesis.\n\nAn ecologist designs a cross-fostering experiment to distinguish between these two hypotheses. Nests of randomly selected long-tailed males and short-tailed males are identified shortly after the eggs are laid. A clutch-swapping procedure is then implemented: half the eggs from each long-tailed male's nest are swapped with half the eggs from a short-tailed male's nest. This creates four groups of offspring raised to adulthood:\n1.  Sons of long-tailed biological fathers raised by short-tailed foster fathers.\n2.  Sons of short-tailed biological fathers raised by long-tailed foster fathers.\n3.  Sons of long-tailed biological fathers raised by long-tailed foster fathers (Control 1).\n4.  Sons of short-tailed biological fathers raised by short-tailed foster fathers (Control 2).\n\nThe ecologist then tracks the male offspring from all groups until they reach reproductive age and measures two key metrics:\n- **Viability**: The proportion of male offspring that survive to reproductive maturity.\n- **Mating Success**: The average number of mates secured by the surviving male offspring.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would provide the strongest evidence for the \"sexy son\" hypothesis as the primary driver of female choice, as opposed to the \"good genes\" hypothesis?\n\nA. The biological father's tail length has no significant effect on offspring viability. However, sons of long-tailed biological fathers, regardless of who raised them, experience significantly higher mating success than sons of short-tailed biological fathers.\n\nB. Sons of long-tailed biological fathers, regardless of who raised them, show significantly higher viability and higher mating success compared to the sons of short-tailed biological fathers.\n\nC. Offspring viability and mating success are both strongly and positively correlated with the tail length of the foster father, with no significant correlation to the biological father's tail length.\n\nD. Sons of long-tailed biological fathers show significantly higher viability, but sons of short-tailed biological fathers experience significantly higher mating success.\n\nE. There are no statistically significant differences in either viability or mating success among any of the experimental groups.", "solution": "The core of this problem is to understand the distinct predictions made by the \"good genes\" hypothesis and the \"sexy son\" hypothesis, and to identify which experimental result uniquely supports one over the other. The cross-fostering experimental design is crucial because it decouples the genetic effects (from the biological father) from the environmental or parental care effects (from the foster father).\n\nFirst, let's define the two hypotheses in the context of this experiment:\n\n1.  **The \"Good Genes\" Hypothesis**: This hypothesis posits that the ornamental trait (long tail feathers) is an honest indicator of a male's superior genetic quality. This \"good genetic quality\" could relate to a stronger immune system, better foraging ability, or overall higher fitness. A female who chooses a male with long tails is thus securing these \"good genes\" for her offspring. A key prediction of this model is that the offspring of long-tailed fathers (both sons and daughters) should have a higher intrinsic fitness, which would manifest as higher viability (e.g., survival to adulthood). The increased mating success of her sons would be a secondary consequence of their superior health and condition.\n\n2.  **The \"Sexy Son\" Hypothesis (or Fisherian Runaway Selection)**: This hypothesis proposes that the female preference for a trait can become self-reinforcing, even if the trait itself has no inherent fitness value (or is even mildly deleterious). Females who prefer long-tailed males will have sons who inherit long tails and daughters who inherit the preference for long tails. The only fitness benefit the female receives is that her \"sexy\" sons will be more attractive to the next generation of females and thus achieve greater reproductive success. This model predicts that the primary benefit is linked to mating success, not necessarily to viability. The trait is 'arbitrarily' attractive.\n\nNow, let's analyze the experimental outcomes presented in the options:\n\n**Option A**: This outcome states that there is no difference in viability based on the biological father's genetics, but there is a significant difference in mating success. Sons of long-tailed fathers are more successful at mating, simply because they have inherited the attractive trait. The lack of a viability advantage directly contradicts a core prediction of the \"good genes\" model (which predicts a direct fitness benefit). This result perfectly aligns with the \"sexy son\" hypothesis, where the fitness advantage is entirely contained within the realm of reproductive success due to inherited attractiveness.\n\n**Option B**: This outcome shows that sons of long-tailed fathers have both higher viability *and* higher mating success. The presence of a significant viability benefit is the classic prediction of the \"good genes\" hypothesis. While this result doesn't disprove the \"sexy son\" hypothesis (as the two are not mutually exclusive), it provides very strong support for \"good genes\" being at least a major factor. Therefore, it is not the *best* evidence for the \"sexy son\" hypothesis *as opposed to* \"good genes\".\n\n**Option C**: This outcome links offspring success to the foster father, not the biological father. This would imply that the observed advantages are due to environmental factors, such as better parenting, territory quality, or resource provision by long-tailed males. This result would undermine both genetic hypotheses (\"good genes\" and \"sexy son\") and point towards a non-heritable, environmental cause for the correlation between tail length and success.\n\n**Option D**: This is a contradictory and confusing result. Higher viability from one group's father and higher mating success from the other's does not cleanly support either of the primary hypotheses. It might suggest a complex trade-off, but it certainly doesn't provide clear evidence for the \"sexy son\" model.\n\n**Option E**: No significant differences in any group would suggest that the female preference is either non-adaptive, or that the trait (tail length) is not actually heritable, or that the experiment failed to detect an effect. This result supports neither hypothesis.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A presents a scenario where the only heritable benefit passed from father to son is attractiveness, which leads to higher mating success without any corresponding increase in general viability. This result isolates the effect predicted by the \"sexy son\" hypothesis while simultaneously failing to support the key prediction of the \"good genes\" hypothesis, making it the strongest evidence for the former in opposition to the latter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1940883"}, {"introduction": "Mate choice is fundamentally an economic decision involving costs and benefits. While searching for a better mate can increase potential reproductive fitness, the search itself is often costly, consuming time and increasing exposure to dangers like predation.
