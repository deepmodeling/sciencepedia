This exercise explores how this asymmetry creates different optimal levels of parental investment from the parent's and offspring's points of view. By modeling the conflict over weaning time, you will calculate how a parent's own life-history strategy—specifically, its chance of surviving to breed again—quantitatively alters the intensity of this evolutionary tug-of-war [@problem_id:1870127].", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, parent-offspring conflict describes the clash of fitness interests between parents and their offspring. A classic example is the conflict over the timing of weaning. A parent's fitness is often maximized by weaning its current offspring relatively early to save resources for future offspring, while the current offspring's fitness is maximized by receiving parental care for as long as possible.\n\nConsider two hypothetical, monogamous bird species that differ in their life-history strategies.\n- **Species A** is a long-lived seabird with a low adult mortality rate. Its annual survival probability for an adult is $P_{s,A} = 0.95$.\n- **Species B** is a short-lived songbird with a high adult mortality rate. Its annual survival probability for an adult is $P_{s,B} = 0.50$.\n\nIn both species, the coefficient of relatedness between an offspring and its future full siblings is $r=0.5$.\n\nA simplified model describes the fitness consequences of parental care. The fitness benefit, $B(t)$, to a current chick from receiving parental care for a duration $t$ (in weeks) is given by:\n$$B(t) = K \\ln(t+1)$$\nThe cost to the parent's future reproductive success, due to the depletion of its own resources, is proportional to the duration of care and is given by:\n$$C(t) = \\lambda t$$\nHere, $K$ and $\\lambda$ are positive constants. For this model, assume the ratio $K/\\lambda$ has the same value for both species: $K/\\lambda = 2.0$ weeks.\n\nThe optimal weaning time for the parent, $t_{parent}$, is the duration of care that maximizes the parent's own inclusive fitness. This optimization considers the trade-off between the benefit to the current offspring and the expected cost to future reproduction, weighted by the parent's survival probability.\n\nThe optimal weaning time for the offspring, $t_{offspring}$, is the duration of care that maximizes the offspring's inclusive fitness. This optimization devalues the fitness of future siblings by the coefficient of relatedness $r$.\n\nThe intensity of parent-offspring conflict for a given species can be quantified by the ratio $I = t_{offspring}/t_{parent}$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the conflict intensity in Species A to that in Species B. That is, compute the value of $I_A / I_B$.
