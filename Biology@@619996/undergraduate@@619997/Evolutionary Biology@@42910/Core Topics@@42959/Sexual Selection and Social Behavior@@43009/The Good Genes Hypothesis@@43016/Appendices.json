The cross-fostering experiment is a powerful tool designed to do just that by swapping offspring between nests. This exercise asks you to analyze the results from such a study to determine whether offspring survival is linked to the genetic father (\"good genes\") or the caregiving foster father (\"good parent\"). [@problem_id:1970858]", "problem": "In the study of sexual selection, the \"good genes\" hypothesis posits that females choose mates with certain ornamental traits (e.g., bright colors, elaborate songs) because these traits are reliable indicators of the male's genetic quality, which is then passed on to their offspring, enhancing their survival or reproductive success. An alternative, the \"good parent\" hypothesis, suggests that these traits indicate a male's ability to provide superior parental care, which is what actually boosts offspring survival.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist is studying a species of bird, the Veridian Warbler, where females show a strong preference for males with long, elaborate tail feathers over males with short, simple tails. To disentangle the \"good genes\" and \"good parent\" hypotheses, the biologist performs a cross-fostering experiment. Shortly after eggs are laid, she swaps half of the clutch from a nest attended by a long-tailed male with half of the clutch from a nest attended by a short-tailed male. This creates four distinct experimental groups of nestlings. After the nesting period, the biologist records the percentage of nestlings in each group that successfully survive to fledging.\n\nThe four groups and their corresponding survival rates are as follows:\n\n- **Group 1**: Offspring genetically sired by a long-tailed male, raised by a long-tailed foster father and his mate. Survival rate: 78%.\n- **Group 2**: Offspring genetically sired by a long-tailed male, raised by a short-tailed foster father and his mate. Survival rate: 75%.\n- **Group 3**: Offspring genetically sired by a short-tailed male, raised by a long-tailed foster father and his mate. Survival rate: 42%.\n- **Group 4**: Offspring genetically sired by a short-tailed male, raised by a short-tailed foster father and his mate. Survival rate: 40%.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following conclusions is most strongly supported by the data?\n\nA. Both the genetic quality of the sire and the parental care quality of the foster father contribute significantly and roughly equally to offspring survival.\n\nB. The quality of parental care provided by the foster father is the primary determinant of offspring survival, while the sire's genetic contribution is negligible.\n\nC. The genetic quality inherited from the sire is the primary determinant of offspring survival, while the quality of parental care has a minimal effect.\n\nD. The sire's traits are correlated with his own parental ability, but his genes provide no direct survival benefit to the offspring when raised by another male.\n\nE. Neither the genetic origin (sire's tail length) nor the rearing environment (foster father's tail length) has a discernible impact on offspring survival.", "solution": "We interpret the cross-fostering design as separating genetic effects of the sire from parental care effects provided by the foster pair.

A female can adopt one of two genetically determined, fixed strategies for the mating season: a \"Choosy\" strategy or a \"Non-choosy\" strategy.\n\nThe population consists of two types of males: high-quality males, which constitute a proportion $q$ of the male population, and low-quality males, which constitute the remaining proportion $1-q$. Mating with a high-quality male results in offspring with an expected fitness of $F_H$, while mating with a low-quality male results in offspring with an expected fitness of $F_L$.\n\nA female's search for a mate involves a series of discrete encounters with individual males. Each encounter, regardless of male quality, exposes the female to a predation risk, such that her probability of surviving the encounter is $s$.\n\n- A **Choosy** female inspects each male she encounters and continues searching until she successfully finds and mates with a high-quality male.

The skinks exist in two distinct morphs: a vibrant 'Crimson' morph and a 'Veridian' morph. The expression of these morphs is controlled by a single, haploid genetic locus, meaning offspring directly inherit the morph of their parent.\n\nThe survival of these skinks is subject to negative frequency-dependent selection due to predation by a visually-hunting hawk. The hawk forms a \"search image\" for the more common morph, making it easier to spot. The viability (probability of surviving to reproductive age) of a skink of a given morph is modeled as $W_v = 1 - c_v f$, where $f$ is the frequency of that morph in the population and $c_v$ is a coefficient representing the intensity of this predatory pressure.\n\nIn addition to this natural selection, the skinks experience sexual selection.
