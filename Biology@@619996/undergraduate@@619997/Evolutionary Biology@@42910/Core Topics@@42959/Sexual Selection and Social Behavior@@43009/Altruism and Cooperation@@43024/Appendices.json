The bird can choose to emit a sharp alarm call. This call will successfully warn its nearby kin, saving them from predation, but will also draw the hawk's attention to the caller, significantly increasing its own personal risk. This altruistic act is thus associated with a fitness cost, $C$, to the individual giving the call.\n\nIn the bird's flock, there are 2 of its full siblings and 4 of its half-siblings. The coefficient of relatedness, $r$, quantifies the genetic similarity between two individuals. For this species, the coefficient of relatedness between full siblings is $0.5$, and between half-siblings it is $0.25$.\n\nIf the bird gives the alarm call, it incurs a personal fitness cost $C = 0.6$.

This exercise will introduce you to frequency-dependent selection, teaching you how to calculate the conditions under which cooperation can invade and dominate a population based on its initial prevalence.", "problem": "In a large, isolated population of primitive hunters, individuals can adopt one of two behavioral strategies for acquiring food: the \"Stag Hunter\" strategy or the \"Hare Hunter\" strategy. The success of a strategy depends on the actions of others, as hunters randomly pair up for each hunting expedition.\n\nThe energetic payoffs are as follows:\n- If a Stag Hunter pairs with another Stag Hunter, they successfully cooperate to hunt a stag, which has an energy value of $E_S$. They share the reward equally.\n- If a Stag Hunter pairs with a Hare Hunter, the cooperative stag hunt fails. The Stag Hunter gets nothing, while the Hare Hunter, acting alone, successfully catches a hare for an energy value of $E_H$.\n- If two Hare Hunters pair up, they do not interact. Each hunts individually and successfully catches a hare, gaining an energy value of $E_H$.\n\nAssume that the population dynamics follow the principles of evolutionary game theory, where the proportion of individuals adopting a strategy in the next generation is directly proportional to that strategy's average energetic payoff (fitness) in the current generation. The energy value of a stag is $E_S = 7500$ units, and the energy value of a hare is $E_H = 2500$ units.\n\nWhat is the minimum initial proportion of Stag Hunters in the population that is required for the Stag Hunter strategy to eventually spread and become the only strategy used in the population? Express your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "Let $x$ be the proportion of Stag Hunters in the population. Random matching implies the expected payoff (fitness) to each strategy is the average over the partner’s type.\n\n- A Stag Hunter paired with a Stag Hunter obtains $\\frac{E_{S}}{2}$, and with a Hare Hunter obtains $0$. Thus the expected payoff to a Stag Hunter is\n$$\nU_{S}(x)=x\\left(\\frac{E_{S}}{2}\\right)+(1-x)\\cdot 0=x\\frac{E_{S}}{2}.\n$$\n- A Hare Hunter obtains $E_{H}$ regardless of the partner’s type, so\n$$\nU_{H}(x)=E_{H}.\n$$\n\nUnder replicator dynamics, the frequency $x$ of Stag Hunters increases if and only if their payoff exceeds that of Hare Hunters. This follows because the replicator equation is\n$$\n\\dot{x}=x\\left(U_{S}-\\bar{U}\\right),\\quad \\bar{U}=xU_{S}+(1-x)U_{H},\n$$\nand $\\mathrm{sign}(\\dot{x})=\\mathrm{sign}(U_{S}-U_{H})$.

This advanced problem challenges you to integrate these two powerful theoretical frameworks, revealing how a kin-selected perspective can alter the predictions of classic economic games and provide deeper insights into the evolution of fairness and negotiation.", "problem": "In a modified version of the classic Ultimatum Game, two players, a Proposer and a Responder, are genetic relatives with a coefficient of relatedness $r$, where $0 \\le r < 1$. The Proposer is endowed with a resource of total size $S$ and must make an offer to the Responder. The Proposer's strategy is to offer a proportion $p$ of the resource, where $0 \\le p \\le 1$. The Responder's strategy is defined by a minimum acceptance threshold $q$, where $0 \\le q \\le 1$; the Responder will accept any offer $p \\ge q$.\n\nIf the Responder accepts the offer ($p \\ge q$), the Proposer's direct payoff is $S_P = (1-p)S$ and the Responder's direct payoff is $S_R = pS$. If the Responder rejects the offer ($p < q$), both players receive a payoff of zero.\n\nThe players' decisions are not based on maximizing their direct payoffs, but on maximizing their inclusive fitness. An individual's inclusive fitness utility is defined as their own direct payoff plus the payoff of their relative weighted by the coefficient of relatedness $r$. Thus, the Proposer's utility is $U_P = S_P + r S_R$, and the Responder's utility is $U_R = S_R + r S_P$.\n\nAssuming a large population where individuals are randomly paired to play this game (with known relatedness $r$), we are looking for the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS). An ESS is a pair of strategies $(p^*, q^*)$ corresponding to a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of the game, which is stable against invasion by any mutant strategy. Determine the ESS offer proportion $p^*$ and the ESS minimum acceptance threshold $q^*$. Express your final answer as the pair $(p^*, q^*)$ in terms of the coefficient of relatedness $r$.", "solution": "We solve by backward induction using inclusive fitness utilities and then verify evolutionary stability.\n\nResponder’s acceptance decision: Given an offer proportion $p \\in [0,1]$, if the Responder accepts, the direct payoffs are $S_{R}=pS$ and $S_{P}=(1-p)S$, so the Responder’s inclusive utility is\n$$\nU_{R}^{\\text{acc}}=S_{R}+r S_{P}=pS+r(1-p)S=S\\big(r+(1-r)p\\big).\n$$\nIf the Responder rejects, both direct payoffs are zero, so\n$$\nU_{R}^{\\text{rej}}=0.\n$$\nSince $S>0$, $r \\in [0,1)$, and $p \\in [0,1]$, we have $r+(1-r)p \\geq 0$ with equality only when $r=0$ and $p=0$.

Hence the Responder’s subgame-perfect acceptance rule is to accept any offer, implying the minimal acceptance threshold\n$$\nq^{*}=0.\n$$\n\nProposer’s offer: Anticipating $q^{*}=0$, any offer is accepted.

Therefore, the Proposer maximizes inclusive utility by choosing the smallest accepted offer, which, given $q^{*}=0$, is\n$$\np^{*}=0.\n$$\n\nEvolutionary stability: In a monomorphic population playing $(p^{*},q^{*})=(0,0)$, any mutant Responder with $q'>0$ rejects $p=0$ and obtains $U_{R}=0$ as Responder, while the resident Responder accepts and obtains $U_{R}=rS \\geq 0$ (strictly larger if $r>0$). Thus such mutants do not invade for $r>0$ and are at best neutral when $r=0$. Any mutant Proposer offering $p'>0$ obtains strictly lower inclusive utility $S\\big(1-(1-r)p'\\big)<S$ than the resident Proposer offering $p^{*}=0$. Therefore, $(0,0)$ is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium and an ESS for all $r \\in [0,1)$.\n\nHence, the ESS pair is independent of $r$ on $[0,1)$:\n$$\n(p^{*},q^{*})=(0,0).\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(0, 0)}$$", "id": "1907894"}]}
