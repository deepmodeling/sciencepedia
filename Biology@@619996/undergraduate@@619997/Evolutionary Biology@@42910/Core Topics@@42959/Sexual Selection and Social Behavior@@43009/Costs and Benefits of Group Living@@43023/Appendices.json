This practice explores the concept of a stable equilibrium group size, which arises when the per-capita benefit of joining is no longer sufficient to meet a minimum survival threshold.

We can model the net per-capita energy intake rate, $I(N)$, for an individual in a group of size $N$ as follows.\n\nThe primary benefit of grouping is reduced time spent on predator vigilance. For a solitary individual ($N=1$), a significant fraction of time is unavailable for foraging. As the group size $N$ increases, the vigilance burden on each individual decreases. The fraction of time an individual can dedicate to foraging is given by the function $T_{forage}(N) = 1 - \\frac{v_0}{N}$, where $v_0$ is a constant representing the baseline vigilance requirement. This model is physically meaningful only for group sizes $N \\ge v_0$. The gross per-capita energy intake rate is proportional to this foraging time, described by $G(N) = R_0 \\cdot T_{forage}(N)$, where $R_0$ is the maximum intake rate achievable with full-time foraging.\n\nThe primary cost of grouping is social stress and interference. This cost reduces an individual's net energy gain. The per-capita energy loss rate is assumed to be linearly proportional to the number of other individuals in the group, given by $C(N) = k(N-1)$, where $k$ is a social cost coefficient.\n\nThe net per-capita energy intake rate is therefore $I(N) = G(N) - C(N)$.\n\nIndividuals from a large pool are motivated to join a group as long as the per-capita intake rate within the group is sufficient for survival. This minimum survival threshold is a constant energy intake rate, $M$.

Consider a fictional species of highly social bird, the Azure-Crested Manakin (*Aureocrista caerulea*).

We can model the net fitness contribution, $W(N)$, for an individual in a group of size $N$ as the difference between a benefit function $B(N)$ and a cost function $C(N)$.\n\nThe primary benefit of group living is enhanced predator detection through collective vigilance. As the group size $N$ increases, the total vigilance increases, but with diminishing returns for each additional member. This benefit is modeled by the function $B(N) = k_1 \\ln(N)$, where $k_1$ is a positive constant representing the efficacy of collective vigilance and $\\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm.\n\nThe primary cost arises from the cognitive stress associated with tracking the complex web of social relationships.
