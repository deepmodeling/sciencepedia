This first practice uses a simplified mathematical model to explore the conditions under which this transition can begin. By analyzing the relative success of a rare 'cheater' mutant that produces smaller gametes, you will investigate the fundamental trade-off between gamete quantity and zygote quality that drives the initial disruption of isogamy [@problem_id:1908705].", "problem": "In theoretical evolutionary biology, the emergence of anisogamy (the existence of distinct small and large gametes, i.e., sperm and eggs) can be modeled from an initially isogamous (all gametes are the same size) population. Consider a simplified model for a large, randomly mating population of a hypothetical diploid organism.\n\nInitially, the population is entirely isogamous, with every individual producing gametes of a uniform size $s_{iso}$. A rare mutant allele appears, causing individuals who carry it to produce smaller \"cheater\" gametes of size $s_{cheat}$, where $s_{cheat} < s_{iso}$.\n\nThe production of gametes is constrained by a fixed reproductive energy budget, $E$, available to each individual per breeding cycle. The number of gametes an individual can produce, $n$, is inversely proportional to the size of each gamete, $s$, according to the relation $n = E/s$.\n\nWhen two gametes fuse, they form a zygote. The viability of this zygote, defined as its probability of surviving to maturity, depends on its total size, $S_{total}$, which is the sum of the sizes of the two fusing gametes. This viability, $V$, is given by the power-law relationship $V(S_{total}) = K(S_{total})^{a}$, where $K$ and $a$ are positive constants.\n\nThe evolutionary success of an individual is proportional to the total number of its offspring that survive to maturity. Assuming the mutant strategy is very rare, calculate the relative success, $W_{rel}$, of a mutant individual compared to a resident isogamous individual. This ratio is defined as the expected number of surviving offspring from a mutant divided by the expected number of surviving offspring from a resident. Express your final answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $s_{iso}$, $s_{cheat}$, and $a$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the relative success, $W_{rel}$, of a rare 'cheater' mutant strategy compared to a resident 'isogamous' strategy. This is the ratio of the expected number of surviving offspring for each type of individual.

This advanced practice explores how anisogamy, by initiating different selective pressures on males and females, can lead to the evolution of sex-specific rates of aging.

In a certain animal species with pronounced anisogamy, individuals possess a total lifetime energy budget of $E_{total}$. This energy is partitioned between reproductive effort, $E_{repro}$, and somatic maintenance, $E_{soma}$, such that $E_{total} = E_{repro} + E_{soma}$. Let $x$ be the fraction of the total energy allocated to reproduction, so $E_{repro} = x E_{total}$ and $E_{soma} = (1-x) E_{total}$.\n\nThe rate of senescence, $\\sigma$, is inversely proportional to the energy invested in somatic maintenance, given by the relation $\\sigma = \\frac{\\kappa}{E_{soma}}$, where $\\kappa$ is a constant representing the intrinsic cost of aging. The probability of an individual surviving from one reproductive cycle to the next, $P_s$, is given by $P_s = \\exp(-\\sigma)$. An individual's fitness is determined by its Lifetime Reproductive Success (LRS), which is the total expected number of offspring over its lifespan. For a constant expected reproductive output per cycle, $R_{cyc}$, the LRS can be expressed as $LRS = \\frac{R_{cyc}}{1 - P_s}$. Individuals of both sexes evolve to an allocation strategy $x^*$ that maximizes their LRS.\n\nThe two sexes have different reproductive strategies:\n- **Females:** Female reproduction is limited by the energetic cost of producing large gametes. Their expected reproductive output per cycle is directly proportional to the energy invested in reproduction: $R_{cyc, f}(x) = C_f x$, where $C_f$ is a proportionality constant.\n- **Males:** Male reproduction is characterized by intense competition for mates. This leads to a winner-take-all dynamic where reproductive success has a strong, non-linear dependence on reproductive investment. Their expected reproductive output per cycle is modeled by a power law: $R_{cyc, m}(x) = C_m x^b$, where $C_m$ is a proportionality constant and $b > 1$ is the coefficient of sexual selection intensity.\n\nYour task is to determine the ratio of the optimal male senescence rate to the optimal female senescence rate, $\\frac{\\sigma_m^*}{\\sigma_f^*}$.
