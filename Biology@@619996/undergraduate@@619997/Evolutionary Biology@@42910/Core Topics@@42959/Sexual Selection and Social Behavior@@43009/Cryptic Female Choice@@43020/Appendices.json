{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in studying cryptic female choice is learning to distinguish it from its constant counterpart: sperm competition. While both processes occur after mating and determine paternity, the key difference lies in which sex is in control. This exercise challenges you to analyze several hypothetical mechanisms for sperm precedence and identify the one that places the selective power in the hands of the female, the defining feature of cryptic female choice [@problem_id:1916360].", "problem": "In many insect species, it is common for a female to mate with multiple males. A well-documented phenomenon known as \"second-male sperm precedence\" is often observed, where the second male to mate with a female sires a significantly higher proportion of her offspring compared to the first male. This outcome can be the result of direct competition between males (sperm competition) or of female-mediated processes (cryptic female choice).\n\nConsider the following four hypothetical mechanisms proposed to explain second-male sperm precedence in a species of fruit fly. Which of these mechanisms is best described as an example of cryptic female choice?\n\nA. The seminal fluid of the second male contains specialized enzymes that incapacitate or destroy the sperm previously stored from the first male.\n\nB. The second male has uniquely shaped genitalia that physically scoop out and remove the sperm deposited by the first male from the female's sperm storage organs.\n\nC. The second male produces a much larger ejaculate than the first, effectively diluting the first male's sperm and winning fertilization success through a lottery-like numerical advantage.\n\nD. Following copulation with the second male, the female's reproductive tract undergoes physiological changes, such as altering muscular contractions or fluid pH, which preferentially transport the sperm of the second male to the fertilization site while hindering the transport of the first male's sperm.", "solution": "We are asked to identify which mechanism exemplifies cryptic female choice, defined as female-mediated, postcopulatory processes within the female reproductive tract that bias paternity toward particular males after mating. This is distinct from sperm competition, which involves direct male-male competition via sperm or male phenotypes affecting the fate of rival sperm.\n\nEvaluate each option by classifying whether the causal mechanism is male-mediated (sperm competition) or female-mediated (cryptic female choice):\n\n- Option A: The outcome is driven by a component of the second male’s ejaculate (enzymes) that incapacitate previously stored sperm. This is a male-mediated displacement mechanism and thus sperm competition, not cryptic female choice.\n\n- Option B: The second male’s genital morphology physically removes previously stored sperm. This is a male-mediated mechanical displacement, i.e., sperm competition, not cryptic female choice.\n\n- Option C: The second male’s larger ejaculate achieves a numerical advantage that dilutes the first male’s sperm, resulting in lottery-like success. This is male-mediated via ejaculate size, i.e., sperm competition, not cryptic female choice.\n\n- Option D: The female’s reproductive tract undergoes physiological changes after mating that bias sperm transport in favor of the second male and hinder the first male’s sperm. Because the process is mediated by female physiology after mating, this is cryptic female choice.\n\nTherefore, the option best described as cryptic female choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1916360"}, {"introduction": "Once we can define cryptic female choice, the next challenge is to prove it is happening. Because these selective events occur inside the female's body, they are not directly observable and require clever experimental design to disentangle them from male-driven sperm competition. This problem asks you to evaluate different potential experimental outcomes and determine which one provides the strongest, most unambiguous support for the action of cryptic female choice [@problem_id:1916332].", "problem": "In many insect species where females mate with multiple males (polyandry), a pattern known as \"last-male sperm precedence\" is common. This means that the last male to copulate with a female typically fertilizes the majority of her eggs. This outcome could be the result of a male-driven process, such as the second male's sperm mechanically displacing or incapacitating the first male's sperm. Alternatively, it could be due to \"cryptic female choice,\" where the female's reproductive system actively biases fertilization towards the sperm of a particular male after insemination has occurred.\n\nImagine you are studying a species of beetle where last-male sperm precedence is the general rule. You want to design an experiment to determine if cryptic female choice is operating, as opposed to simple mechanical sperm displacement by the second male. Which of the following experimental outcomes would provide the most conclusive evidence for cryptic female choice?\n\nA. In a controlled setting, it is observed that the second male to mate consistently has a longer copulation duration than the first male.\n\nB. Dissection of the female reproductive tract reveals specialized sperm storage organs (spermathecae) with complex internal structures.\n\nC. When females mate with two unrelated males, the second male's ejaculate is measured to be, on average, 20% larger than the first male's.\n\nD. When a female mates first with a male from her own population and second with a male from a genetically distant population, the first male (from her own population) consistently fathers a significantly higher proportion of the offspring, contrary to the typical last-male precedence pattern.\n\nE. Males possess an intermittent organ (aedeagus) with spines or scoops that, upon dissection, are found to be capable of removing rival ejaculates from the female tract.", "solution": "Define the alternative mechanisms and their distinct predictions:\n- Under mechanical sperm displacement (male-driven), paternity is primarily determined by mating order and male traits that physically displace, outnumber, or incapacitate prior sperm. Predictions: the second male generally sires more offspring regardless of male identity or genetic compatibility with the female; factors like copulation duration, ejaculate volume, and genital morphology that facilitate displacement should correlate with last-male precedence.\n- Under cryptic female choice (female-driven), the female reproductive tract selectively uses sperm based on male identity or compatibility after insemination. Predictions: paternity can deviate from last-male precedence when males differ in genetic compatibility or cues that the female biases towards; identity-based or compatibility-based biases can override order effects.\n\nEvaluate each option against these predictions:\n- Option A (second male longer copulation duration): This supports a male-driven mechanism, as longer copulation can increase sperm transfer or displacement efficiency, reinforcing last-male precedence. It does not indicate female-mediated selection. Not evidence for cryptic female choice.\n- Option B (complex spermathecae): While complex storage organs could enable female control, their presence alone is not evidence of active bias. Structure is consistent with either mechanism and is not a direct test of function or selective use. Not conclusive.\n- Option C (second male larger ejaculate): A larger ejaculate by the second male directly supports numerical or displacement advantages and explains last-male precedence without invoking female choice. Not evidence for cryptic female choice.\n- Option D (order inversion with genetic compatibility: first male from female’s own population sires more despite mating first, while the second male is genetically distant): This outcome contradicts the default last-male precedence and shows that male identity/genetic compatibility can override the order effect. Such conspecific or population-level sperm precedence is consistent with female-mediated postcopulatory choice, not with a purely mechanical displacement model, which would still predict second-male advantage regardless of origin. This provides direct, functional evidence for cryptic female choice.\n- Option E (male genital spines/scoops capable of removing rival ejaculates): This offers a clear male-driven displacement mechanism, arguing against the necessity of cryptic female choice. Not evidence for cryptic female choice.\n\nTherefore, the outcome most conclusively supporting cryptic female choice is the identity- and compatibility-dependent reversal of last-male precedence described in Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1916332"}, {"introduction": "Modern studies of cryptic female choice rely heavily on genetic tools to assign paternity and quantify its patterns. By analyzing molecular markers, researchers can move beyond simply inferring choice to precisely measuring its strength and direction. This final practice problem gives you a taste of this quantitative approach, asking you to use hypothetical genetic data to determine paternity shares and test a hypothesis about inbreeding avoidance [@problem_id:1916352].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is investigating post-copulatory mate choice in the hermaphroditic garden snail, *Helix aspersa*. The hypothesis is that when acting as the female, a snail will preferentially use sperm from less-related partners to fertilize its eggs, thereby avoiding inbreeding.\n\nTo test this, a focal snail (the 'dam') was mated with two other snails: 'Sire A', a full sibling, and 'Sire B', an unrelated individual from a distant population. The dam was allowed to lay a single clutch of eggs. It is assumed that sperm from both sires were stored and available for fertilization.\n\nGenetic analysis was performed using a single, highly variable, codominant microsatellite marker locus, designated 'L'. The genotypes of the three parental snails at this locus are as follows:\n- Dam: L1L2\n- Sire A (related): L1L3\n- Sire B (unrelated): L4L5\n\nA random sample of 100 offspring from the egg clutch was then genotyped at the L locus. The results were as follows:\n- 25 offspring had genotypes composed exclusively of alleles L1, L2, and L3.\n- 75 offspring had genotypes that included either the L4 or L5 allele.\n\nBased on this data, calculate the proportion of offspring in the sample that were sired by the unrelated snail (Sire B). Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Each offspring inherits exactly one allele from the dam and one allele from the sire at locus L (Mendelian segregation) and the locus is codominant, so both alleles in a heterozygote are observable.\n\nParental genotypes are:\n- Dam: $L1L2$\n- Sire A: $L1L3$\n- Sire B: $L4L5$\n\nIf Sire A fertilizes an egg, the possible offspring genotypes are formed by combining one maternal allele ($L1$ or $L2$) with one paternal allele ($L1$ or $L3$), yielding the set $\\{L1L1, L1L2, L1L3, L2L3\\}$, which uses only alleles $L1$, $L2$, and $L3$.\n\nIf Sire B fertilizes an egg, the possible offspring genotypes are formed by combining one maternal allele ($L1$ or $L2$) with one paternal allele ($L4$ or $L5$), yielding the set $\\{L1L4, L1L5, L2L4, L2L5\\}$, each of which includes $L4$ or $L5$.\n\nTherefore, any offspring genotype that includes $L4$ or $L5$ must have been sired by Sire B, and any offspring genotype composed exclusively of $L1$, $L2$, and $L3$ must have been sired by Sire A.
