An individual organism can choose to secrete a costly enzyme that dissolves mineral-rich nodules in its immediate environment. This process, while metabolically expensive for the individual, releases a plume of dissolved nutrients that can be absorbed by a nearby colony member.\n\nSuppose that the lifetime reproductive success of an individual is measured in abstract \"fitness units\". The act of secreting the enzyme imposes a direct fitness cost, $C$, on the actor, reducing its expected lifetime reproductive output by $C = 1.25$ fitness units.

She is a member of a diploid, outbred species. For the upcoming breeding season, she can choose one of two mutually exclusive actions, both of which incur an identical fitness cost, $C$, to her.\n\n**Action 1:** She can remain in her natal group and act as a \"helper,\" assisting her parents in successfully raising two additional offspring that they would not be able to raise without her help. These offspring would be her full siblings.\n\n**Action 2:** She can disperse to a nearby group which is led by her mother's full sister (her aunt).

The decision cannot be made without knowing the exact numerical value of the cost, $C$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which of two altruistic actions provides a greater benefit to an individual's inclusive fitness. The theoretical framework for this is Hamilton's rule, which states that an altruistic act is favored by natural selection if the fitness benefit to the recipient, weighted by the genetic relatedness between the actor and the recipient, exceeds the fitness cost to the actor. The rule is expressed as the inequality:\n$$rB > C$$\nwhere:\n- $r$ is the coefficient of relatedness between the actor (the helper meerkat) and the recipient of the help (the offspring being raised).\n- $B$ is the benefit, measured as the number of additional offspring produced by the recipient due to the actor's help.\n- $C$ is the cost to the actor's own reproductive fitness.\n\nThe problem states that the cost, $C$, is identical for both actions. To determine which action provides the greater increase in inclusive fitness, we need to compare the value of the term $rB$ for each scenario. The action with the larger $rB$ product is the more evolutionarily advantageous choice.\n\n**Action 1: Helping to raise full siblings.**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the coefficient of relatedness, $r_{sib}$, between the helper meerkat and her full siblings. In a diploid, sexually reproducing species, an individual shares, on average, half of its genes with each parent. Full siblings share both parents. The probability that a specific allele from the mother is passed to both the helper and a new sibling is $(\\frac{1}{2}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$. Similarly, the probability that a specific allele from the father is passed to both is $(\\frac{1}{2}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$. Since the parents are unrelated (outbred), the total coefficient of relatedness is the sum of these probabilities from both parental lines.\n$$r_{sib} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right)_{\\text{maternal}} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right)_{\\text{paternal}} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\nThe benefit, $B_1$, is the number of additional siblings raised, which is given as 2.\n\nThe inclusive fitness benefit for Action 1 is:\n$$r_{sib} B_1 = (0.5) \\times 2 = 1.0$$\n\n**Action 2: Helping to raise first cousins.**\n\nNext, we determine the coefficient of relatedness, $r_{cousin}$, between the helper meerkat and her first cousins. Her cousins are the offspring of her maternal aunt. The common ancestors between the helper and her cousins are her maternal grandparents.\nThe path from the helper to a cousin goes through the helper's mother, then to a shared grandparent, then to the aunt, and finally to the cousin.\nLet's trace the genetic path from a shared grandparent. The probability of an allele from a grandparent being in the helper is $(\\frac{1}{2})_{\\text{to mother}} \\times (\\frac{1}{2})_{\\text{to helper}} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe probability of that same allele being in a cousin is $(\\frac{1}{2})_{\\text{to aunt}} \\times (\\frac{1}{2})_{\\text{to cousin}} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe relatedness through one shared grandparent is the product of these probabilities, but this is incorrect. A more standard way is path analysis.\nThe path from the helper to her mother is one step ($r=1/2$). The path from the mother to the shared grandparent is one step ($r=1/2$). The path from the grandparent to the aunt is one step ($r=1/2$). The path from the aunt to the cousin is one step ($r=1/2$).\nThere are two such paths, one through the maternal grandmother and one through the maternal grandfather.\nPath 1 (via grandmother): Helper $\\leftarrow$ Mother $\\leftarrow$ Grandmother $\\rightarrow$ Aunt $\\rightarrow$ Cousin. This path has 4 steps. The genetic contribution through this path is $(\\frac{1}{2})^4 = \\frac{1}{16}$.\nPath 2 (via grandfather): Helper $\\leftarrow$ Mother $\\leftarrow$ Grandfather $\\rightarrow$ Aunt $\\rightarrow$ Cousin. This path also has 4 steps. The genetic contribution is $(\\frac{1}{2})^4 = \\frac{1}{16}$.\nThe total coefficient of relatedness is the sum of contributions from all independent paths:\n$$r_{cousin} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125$$\nThe benefit, $B_2$, is the number of additional cousins raised, which is given as 5.\n\nThe inclusive fitness benefit for Action 2 is:\n$$r_{cousin} B_2 = (0.125) \\times 5 = 0.625$$\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nWe compare the inclusive fitness benefits from the two actions:\n- Benefit from Action 1 ($r_{sib} B_1$): $1.0$\n- Benefit from Action 2 ($r_{cousin} B_2$): $0.625$\n\nSince $1.0 > 0.625$, Action 1 provides a greater increase to the helper's inclusive fitness. Even though the number of individuals helped is smaller (2 vs. 5), the much higher coefficient of relatedness to full siblings makes this the superior evolutionary strategy.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the comparison of benefits ($rB$) is independent of the cost $C$, as long as we are only asked to choose the action with the *greater* benefit. The problem statement guarantees that at least one action is beneficial (i.e., $rB>C$), so we only need to find the maximum $rB$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1936241"}, {"introduction": "The coefficient of relatedness, $r$, is not a universal constant for a given relationship; it is a direct consequence of a species' genetic system.

Here, $C$ is the fitness cost to the altruist (e.g., lost personal reproduction), $B$ is the fitness benefit to the recipient (e.g., increased survival or reproduction), and $r$ is the coefficient of relatedness between the altruist and the recipient. The coefficient of relatedness represents the probability that a gene picked randomly from the altruist's genome is identical by descent to a gene at the same locus in the recipient's genome.\n\nConsider a scenario where an altruistic female helper forgoes her own reproduction to help her mother raise a new full sister.
