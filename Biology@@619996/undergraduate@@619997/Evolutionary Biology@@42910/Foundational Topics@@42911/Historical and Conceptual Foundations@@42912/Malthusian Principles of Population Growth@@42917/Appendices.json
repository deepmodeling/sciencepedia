The number of people at the start of any given year $n$ is described by the formula $P_n = P_0(1+r)^n$, where the annual growth rate is $r = 0.03$.\n\nSimultaneously, due to agricultural improvements, the food production increases arithmetically. The total food supply available for consumption during year $n$ is given by $S_n = S_0 + d \\cdot n$, where the supply increases by a constant amount $d=50$ bushels each year.\n\nIt is assumed that in the initial year ($n=0$), the food supply is exactly sufficient to meet the population's needs.

This final, more advanced practice challenges you to think about long-term sustainability by incorporating periodic catastrophes into the Malthusian framework. You will determine the maximum frequency of such events that would allow a population to persist indefinitely without its exponential potential ever overwhelming its arithmetically growing resource base [@problem_id:1945387]. Successfully solving this reveals a critical condition for stability: the population's long-term average growth rate must be balanced to zero to avoid both extinction and resource overshoot.", "problem": "A species of photosynthetic microorganism is being cultivated in an advanced bioreactor. In the absence of constraints, the population of these organisms grows exponentially with an intrinsic growth rate of $r = 0.500 \\text{ year}^{-1}$. The sole limiting resource for the population is a special nutrient solution. The total amount of available nutrients, measured in units that can support a certain number of organisms, increases arithmetically with time due to a constant-rate supply system.\n\nTo maintain control over the culture, the bioreactor is periodically and rapidly flushed. Each flush is a catastrophic event for the microorganisms, instantly removing 75% of the population. We are interested in finding the conditions that allow for a permanent, stable population: one that does not go extinct but also never outstrips the arithmetically growing resources.\n\nAssuming such a stable state is possible, determine the maximum frequency of flushes that would permit its existence. Express your answer in units of flushes per year, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $N(t)$ be the population of microorganisms at time $t$, and $R(t)$ be the amount of available resources at time $t$. The problem states that the population grows exponentially with an intrinsic rate $r$, while the resources grow arithmetically. A catastrophic flush occurs periodically with a frequency $f$, corresponding to a time period of $T = 1/f$. Each flush reduces the population by 75%, meaning the population is multiplied by a factor of $(1 - 0.75) = 0.25$.\n\nLet's analyze the population dynamics over cycles. Let $N_{n-1}^{+}$ be the population size immediately after the $(n-1)$-th flush, which occurs at time $t_{n-1} = (n-1)T$. In the subsequent interval until the next flush, the population grows exponentially:\n$$N(t) = N_{n-1}^{+} \\exp(r(t - (n-1)T)) \\quad \\text{for } t \\in [(n-1)T, nT)$$\nThe population just before the $n$-th flush at time $t_n = nT$ is:\n$$N_n^{-} = N_{n-1}^{+} \\exp(rT)$$\nImmediately after the flush, the population becomes:\n$$N_n^{+} = (1 - \\gamma) N_n^{-}$$\nwhere $\\gamma = 0.75$ is the fraction of the population removed.\nSubstituting the expression for $N_n^{-}$, we get a recurrence relation for the post-flush population sizes:\n$$N_n^{+} = (1 - \\gamma) N_{n-1}^{+} \\exp(rT)$$\n\nFor a \"permanent, stable population\" to exist, two conditions must be met:\n1.  **Non-extinction**: The population must not die out. This means the sequence of population sizes $N_n^{+}$ must not converge to zero. This requires the multiplier in the recurrence relation to be at least one.\n$$(1 - \\gamma) \\exp(rT) \\ge 1$$\nThis condition sets a lower bound on the period $T$. A shorter period (higher frequency) does not allow the population enough time to recover between flushes.\n$$ \\exp(rT) \\ge \\frac{1}{1 - \\gamma} $$\n$$ rT \\ge \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - \\gamma}\\right) $$\n$$ T \\ge \\frac{-\\ln(1 - \\gamma)}{r} $$\nThis implies that the frequency $f = 1/T$ must be less than or equal to a maximum value:\n$$ f \\le \\frac{r}{-\\ln(1 - \\gamma)} $$\n\n2.  **No resource overshoot**: The population $N(t)$ must never exceed the available resources $R(t)$. The resources grow arithmetically, so $R(t) = R_0 + kt$ for some initial resource level $R_0$ and supply rate $k$.\nLet's consider the case where $(1 - \\gamma) \\exp(rT) > 1$. In this scenario, the post-flush population $N_n^{+}$ grows exponentially with each cycle. Consequently, the peak population before each flush, $N_n^{-}$, also grows exponentially. Since the resource level $R(t)$ grows only linearly (arithmetically), an exponentially growing population will inevitably surpass a linearly growing resource level, regardless of the initial values $R_0$ and $k$. Therefore, to \"permanently avoid outstripping\" the resources, the strict inequality cannot hold.\n\nCombining both conditions, the only possibility for a permanent, stable, non-zero population is the boundary case where the multiplier is exactly one:\n$$(1 - \\gamma) \\exp(rT) = 1$$\nThis unique period ensures that the population neither dies out nor grows uncontrollably from cycle to cycle. At this period, the population size at the beginning (and end) of each cycle becomes constant (after an initial transient phase), leading to a stable limit cycle.\n\nThis condition allows us to solve for the specific period $T$ required for such a stable state:\n$$ rT = -\\ln(1 - \\gamma) $$\n$$ T = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - \\gamma)}{r} $$\nThis is the minimum period required for population survival. Any period shorter than this (i.e., any frequency higher) would lead to extinction. Therefore, the maximum frequency at which a stable population is possible is $f_{max} = 1/T$.\n$$ f_{max} = \\frac{r}{-\\ln(1 - \\gamma)} $$\nThis result is independent of the specific parameters of the arithmetic resource growth ($R_0, k$) or the initial population size ($N_0$), as the logic relies on the long-term behavior of exponential versus arithmetic growth.\n\nNow we substitute the given values:\nIntrinsic growth rate, $r = 0.500 \\text{ year}^{-1}$.\nFraction of population removed, $\\gamma = 0.75$.\n\n$$ f_{max} = \\frac{0.500}{-\\ln(1 - 0.75)} = \\frac{0.500}{-\\ln(0.25)} $$\nUsing the logarithm property $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$:\n$$ f_{max} = \\frac{0.500}{\\ln(1/0.25)} = \\frac{0.500}{\\ln(4)} $$\nUsing the property $\\ln(a^b) = b\\ln(a)$:\n$$ f_{max} = \\frac{0.500}{\\ln(2^2)} = \\frac{0.500}{2\\ln(2)} = \\frac{0.250}{\\ln(2)} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value.
