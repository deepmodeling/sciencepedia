This boundary, now known as the Wallace Line, separates the biogeographic realms of Asia (the Sunda Shelf) and Australia (the Sahul Shelf). To quantitatively assess such biogeographic discontinuities, ecologists often use similarity indices.\n\nAn ecologist has compiled lists of terrestrial vertebrate genera from two hypothetical islands, Pulau Barat (\"West Island\") and Pulau Timur (\"East Island\"), situated on opposite sides of the Wallace Line. Your task is to calculate the faunal similarity between them.\n\nThe faunal list for Pulau Barat, representing the Sunda realm, is:\n*Macaca*, *Panthera*, *Viverra*, *Sus*, *Tragulus*, *Galeopterus*, *Helarctos*, *Manis*, *Tupaia*, *Petaurista*, *Rattus*, *Cynopterus*\n\nThe faunal list for Pulau Timur, representing the Sahul realm, is:\n*Dendrolagus*, *Phalanger*, *Dasyurus*, *Perameles*, *Zaglossus*, *Cacatua*, *Varanus*, *Morelia*, *Litoria*, *Thylogale*, *Pteropus*, *Rattus*, *Cynopterus*\n\nTo measure the similarity, you will use the Jaccard Similarity Index ($J_s$).

He saw how natural selection could produce uncanny resemblances between species, providing protection from predators. This practice places you in the role of a field ecologist tasked with interpreting experimental data to distinguish between two major types of mimicry, sharpening your skills in hypothesis testing and data analysis. [@problem_id:1907279]", "problem": "Inspired by the pioneering fieldwork of Alfred Russel Wallace in the Malay Archipelago, a modern ecologist designs an experiment to investigate the relationship between two co-occurring, conspicuously colored butterfly species. Species T (*Toxicus wallacei*) is known to be unpalatable to local avian predators due to sequestered toxins. Species S (*Simulans alfredi*) bears a striking resemblance to Species T, but its own palatability is unknown.\n\nThe ecologist's goal is to determine if Species S is a Batesian mimic (a palatable species mimicking an unpalatable one) or if it is part of a Müllerian mimicry complex (where both species are unpalatable and share a warning signal).\n\nTo test this, the ecologist creates realistic, edible models of Species S and also of a third, local butterfly, Species C (*Controlus communis*). Species C is known to be palatable and has a cryptic, non-mimetic coloration. The experiment is conducted in two large, geographically separate forest reserves:\n- **Location 1**: A reserve where the unpalatable model, Species T, is naturally abundant.\n- **Location 2**: A reserve, with a similar avian predator community, but where Species T is naturally absent.\n\nIn each location, 400 models of Species S and 400 models of the palatable control, Species C, are placed in the environment. After a set period, the models are collected, and the number showing clear evidence of avian predation attempts (e.g., beak marks) is recorded. The results are as follows:\n\n- **In Location 1 (with Species T present):**\n  - Models of Species S: 24 predation attempts.\n  - Models of Species C: 168 predation attempts.\n\n- **In Location 2 (without Species T present):**\n  - Models of Species S: 162 predation attempts.\n  - Models of Species C: 172 predation attempts.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most likely evolutionary relationship between Species S and Species T?\n\nA. Species S is a Batesian mimic of Species T.\n\nB. Species S and Species T form a Müllerian mimicry complex.\n\nC. Species S is also unpalatable and is aposematically colored, but it is not mimicking Species T.\n\nD. Species S is a predator of Species T, engaging in aggressive mimicry.\n\nE. The data are inconclusive as the predation pressure on the real Species T was not measured.", "solution": "We define the ecologist’s test as measuring attack probabilities on edible models, which reflect avian predators’ learned avoidance of unpalatability and visual signals. Let $p_{S,1}$ and $p_{C,1}$ denote the predation probabilities on Species S and Species C in Location 1 (with Species T present), and $p_{S,2}$ and $p_{C,2}$ the corresponding probabilities in Location 2 (without Species T).\n\nCompute the observed attack probabilities:\n- In Location 1: $p_{S,1} = \\frac{24}{400} = \\frac{3}{50} = 0.06$, and $p_{C,1} = \\frac{168}{400} = \\frac{21}{50} = 0.42$.\n- In Location 2: $p_{S,2} = \\frac{162}{400} = \\frac{81}{200} = 0.405$, and $p_{C,2} = \\frac{172}{400} = \\frac{43}{100} = 0.43$.\n\nState the key evolutionary hypotheses and their predictions:\n- Batesian mimicry (Species S palatable mimicking unpalatable Species T): \n  - Prediction 1: When Species T is present, predators generalize avoidance, so $p_{S,1} \\ll p_{C,1}$.\n  - Prediction 2: When Species T is absent, no avoidance is learned from the model, so $p_{S,2} \\approx p_{C,2}$ (both high, as both are palatable-looking/edible).\n- Müllerian mimicry (both S and T unpalatable sharing a warning signal):\n  - Prediction 1: When Species T is present, $p_{S,1} \\ll p_{C,1}$ due to shared warning.\n  - Prediction 2: Even when Species T is absent, if S itself is unpalatable, predators should learn to avoid S from direct encounters, leading to $p_{S,2} \\ll p_{C,2}$ and a generally low $p_{S,2}$.\n\nCompare observations with predictions:\n- In Location 1 (with T present): $p_{S,1} = 0.06$ is far lower than $p_{C,1} = 0.42$, matching both Batesian and Müllerian predictions of protection via the warning signal.\n- In Location 2 (without T): $p_{S,2} = 0.405$ is approximately equal to $p_{C,2} = 0.43$, indicating S is attacked at nearly the same high rate as the known palatable control. This matches the Batesian prediction ($p_{S,2} \\approx p_{C,2}$), and contradicts the Müllerian prediction ($p_{S,2}$ should remain low if S were unpalatable).\n\nThus, the context dependence—strong protection only where T is present and loss of protection where T is absent—indicates that S is palatable and benefits from the presence of the unpalatable model T through predator generalization. Therefore, Species S is a Batesian mimic of Species T.\n\nEliminate alternatives:\n- B is inconsistent with the high $p_{S,2}$ in the absence of T.\n- C is inconsistent with S’s high attack rate in Location 2 relative to a palatable control.\n- D is irrelevant to the observed avian predation patterns on edible models.\n- E is incorrect because the experimental design directly tests predator responses to S under varying presence of the model T; the contrast across locations is decisive without measuring attacks on real T.\n\nTherefore, the most likely relationship is Batesian mimicry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1907279"}, {"introduction": "Once a mimicry system is identified, a deeper question arises: what governs its stability and dynamics? Palatable mimics, for example, can only thrive if they are rare compared to their unpalatable models—a concept known as frequency-dependent selection. This advanced problem challenges you to use the tools of evolutionary game theory to build a mathematical model that determines the equilibrium population size of a Batesian mimic, providing a quantitative understanding of the ecological limits that shape these remarkable adaptations. [@problem_id:1907313]", "problem": "Inspired by the extensive fieldwork of Alfred Russel Wallace in the Malay Archipelago, consider a simplified ecosystem containing a Müllerian mimicry ring and a potential Batesian mimic. The ring consists of two distinct species of unpalatable butterflies, Species 1 and Species 2, which have converged on an identical, conspicuous warning coloration. Their populations are stable at sizes $N_1$ and $N_2$, respectively. Their levels of chemical defense, which cause a negative experience for predators, are quantified by noxiousness values $c_1$ and $c_2$.\n\nA third, palatable species of insect, Species B, is considering \"invading\" this system. This species has two possible morphs: a cryptic morph that is camouflaged, and a mimetic morph that perfectly imitates the warning coloration of the Müllerian ring.\n\nThe predation dynamics are governed by a large population of generalist avian predators. The probability of predation on any individual displaying the conspicuous warning signal, $P_{pred}$, is determined by the average noxiousness, $\\bar{c}$, of all individuals sharing the signal. This relationship is modeled by the equation:\n$$P_{pred} = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda \\bar{c})$$\nHere, $A_0$ is the baseline predation risk for any conspicuous, non-defended insect, and $\\lambda$ is a positive constant representing the effectiveness of predator learning. The average noxiousness $\\bar{c}$ is the population-weighted mean noxiousness of all individuals (from Species 1, Species 2, and the mimetic morph of Species B) that display the signal. The palatable mimic has a noxiousness of zero.\n\nThe alternative cryptic morph of Species B experiences a constant, frequency-independent probability of predation, $P_{cryptic}$, due to its camouflage. It is given that $P_{cryptic} < A_0$.\n\nAn evolutionary equilibrium is reached when the fitness of the mimetic morph is equal to the fitness of the cryptic morph. Assuming that fitness is solely determined by survival from predation (i.e., fitness is proportional to $1 - P_{predation}$), find the equilibrium population size, $N_B$, of the Batesian mimic morph.
