To study this process quantitatively, we must move beyond the qualitative phrase \"survival of the fittest\". This exercise introduces the fundamental concept of *relative fitness* ($w$), which allows us to compare the evolutionary success of different phenotypes by measuring their reproductive output relative to the most successful phenotype in the population. Calculating relative fitness, as demonstrated in this problem about fictional Azure-crested Warblers [@problem_id:1916865], is the first step toward building mathematical models of evolution.", "problem": "In a stable, isolated population of fictional Azure-crested Warblers, a long-term ecological study was conducted to understand the effects of plumage coloration on reproductive success. Two distinct, genetically determined phenotypes exist among the males: those with \"Vibrant\" blue crests and those with \"Subdued\" grey crests. The study meticulously tracked the lifetime reproductive output of numerous males from both groups. The primary metric for success was defined as the number of offspring surviving to their own reproductive maturity.\n\nThe data, averaged over the entire study period, revealed the following:\n- A male with the \"Vibrant\" phenotype, on average, produces 19 offspring that survive to maturity.\n- A male with the \"Subdued\" phenotype, on average, produces 13 offspring that survive to maturity.\n\nAssuming these values represent the absolute fitness for each phenotype, calculate the relative fitness of a male with the \"Subdued\" phenotype. Express your answer as a single real number, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the absolute fitnesses be denoted by $W_{\\text{V}}$ for the Vibrant phenotype and $W_{\\text{S}}$ for the Subdued phenotype. From the data, $W_{\\text{V}}=19$ and $W_{\\text{S}}=13$.\n\nRelative fitness $w_{i}$ is defined as the absolute fitness of phenotype $i$ normalized by a reference fitness, typically chosen as the maximum absolute fitness in the population so that the best-performing phenotype has relative fitness $1$. Thus, set\n$$\nW_{\\text{ref}}=\\max\\{W_{\\text{V}},W_{\\text{S}}\\}=19.\n$$\nThe relative fitness of the Subdued phenotype is then\n$$\nw_{\\text{S}}=\\frac{W_{\\text{S}}}{W_{\\text{ref}}}=\\frac{13}{19}.\n$$\nCompute the decimal approximation and round to three significant figures:\n$$\n\\frac{13}{19}\\approx 0.684210526\\dots \\approx 0.684.\n$$\nTherefore, the relative fitness of a Subdued male is $0.684$ (to three significant figures).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.684}$$", "id": "1916865"}, {"introduction": "A key insight of evolutionary theory is that fitness is not an intrinsic, fixed property of an organism but is contingent upon its environment.
