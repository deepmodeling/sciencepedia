The population's flower color is determined by a single gene with two co-dominant alleles.\n\nFirst, let's define the frequencies of the two alleles. Let $p$ be the frequency of the $C^R$ allele and $q$ be the frequency of the $C^B$ allele.\nThe problem states that the frequency of the $C^R$ allele is 0.6.\nSo, $p = 0.6$.\n\nSince there are only two alleles for this gene in the population, the sum of their frequencies must be equal to 1.\n$$p + q = 1$$\nWe can solve for $q$, the frequency of the $C^B$ allele:\n$$q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$$\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle describes the relationship between allele frequencies and genotype frequencies in a population at equilibrium. The genotype frequencies are given by the terms of the binomial expansion $(p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$.\n\n1.  The frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype, $C^R C^R$, is given by $p^2$.\n2.

The fate of a newly arisen beneficial allele is not solely determined by its selective advantage; in populations of finite size, it can be lost due to random chance, an effect that is more pronounced in smaller populations.\n\nConsider a diploid species where a new, beneficial allele has emerged. The fitness of individuals is determined by their genotype at this locus. Individuals homozygous for the ancestral allele have a relative fitness of 1. Heterozygous individuals carrying one copy of the new allele have a relative fitness of $1+s$, and individuals homozygous for the new allele have a relative fitness of $1+2s$.
