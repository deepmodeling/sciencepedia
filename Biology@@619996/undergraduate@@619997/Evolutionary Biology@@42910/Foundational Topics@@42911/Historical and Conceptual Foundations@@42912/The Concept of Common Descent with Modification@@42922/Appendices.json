You will apply the core principles of natural selection to predict adaptive change in a fish population introduced to a novel environment. This practice sharpens your ability to link specific environmental pressures to heritable traits, illustrating the fundamental mechanism of modification that drives evolutionary change [@problem_id:1969759].", "problem": "A population of fish, a species known as the \"Slender-jawed Minnow\" (*Leptorhamphus gracilis*), primarily feeds on soft-bodied aquatic insect larvae in its native river habitat. This feeding strategy is supported by their long, delicate jaws and fine, pointed teeth, which are efficient for grasping small, soft prey from the water column. A research team translocates a large, genetically diverse group of these minnows to a newly formed, isolated volcanic crater lake. In this new environment, the only abundant and viable food source is a species of small, hard-shelled snail that lives on the lakebed rocks.\n\nAssume the following:\n1. The initial minnow population exhibits natural, heritable variation in several morphological traits, including the robustness of the jaw bones, the size of the jaw-closing muscle (adductor mandibulae), and the shape of the teeth (ranging from pointed to more rounded and robust).\n2. The minnows are the only predators of the snails in the lake, and the snails are the only food source for the minnows.\n3. The population survives and reproduces for many generations in this new lake.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions most accurately predicts the evolutionary changes that would be observed in the minnow population over a period of many generations?\n\nA. The population will show a directional shift towards individuals possessing, on average, shorter, more robust jaws, larger adductor mandibulae muscles, and thicker, more molar-like teeth.\n\nB. Individual fish will strengthen their jaws by attempting to crush the hard snail shells. These acquired, more powerful jaws will be directly passed on to their offspring, leading to a stronger-jawed population.\n\nC. The population's jaw morphology will not change, as the traits of a species are fixed. The fish will instead evolve new digestive enzymes better suited for breaking down snail tissue.\n\nD. The average jaw morphology of the population will change unpredictably from one generation to the next due to random genetic mutations and genetic drift, with no clear directional trend.\n\nE. The population will evolve more slender and elongated jaws to improve their ability to probe crevices for snails, as crushing force is less important than the ability to reach the prey.", "solution": "We apply the standard logic of adaptive evolution by natural selection:\n\n1) Preconditions for evolution by natural selection are satisfied. Assumption 1 states there is heritable variation in jaw robustness, adductor mandibulae size, and tooth shape; thus for each trait $z$ (e.g., jaw robustness), the narrow-sense heritability satisfies $h^2 > 0$. Assumption 2 ensures a consistent and strong ecological pressure: the only available food is hard-shelled snails, and minnows must exploit them to survive. Assumption 3 provides many generations, allowing cumulative evolutionary change.\n\n2) Directional selection on feeding performance is expected. In a hard-prey environment, fitness increases with effective shell-crushing performance. Biomechanical principles imply:\n- Bite force scales with muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage. For a simple lever model of the jaw, bite force is proportional to muscle force times the in-lever to out-lever ratio; shorter, more robust jaws (reduced out-lever) and larger adductor muscles increase bite force and reduce risk of structural failure under load.\n- Tooth morphology under hard-prey feeding experiences high compressive and bending stresses; thicker, more molar-like teeth distribute stress and resist fracture better than fine, pointed teeth.\n\nHence, the fitness function $w(z)$ increases monotonically with greater jaw robustness, larger adductor muscles, and more molariform teeth. Therefore, the selection differential $S = \\bar{z}_{\\text{selected}} - \\bar{z}$ is positive for these traits.\n\n3) Predicted evolutionary response follows the breeder’s equation. For each trait,\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z} = h^{2} S,\n$$\nso with $h^2 > 0$ and $S > 0$, we obtain $\\Delta \\bar{z} > 0$ in the direction of increased crushing ability. Across many generations with a persistent environment, this yields a directional shift in the population means toward shorter, more robust jaws, larger adductor mandibulae, and thicker, molar-like teeth.\n\n4) Evaluation of the options:\n- A: Matches the predicted directional selection on crushing performance, consistent with biomechanics and the breeder’s equation. This is the expected outcome.\n- B: Invokes inheritance of acquired characteristics. Use-induced changes within an individual are not directly inherited; evolutionary change arises via differential survival and reproduction changing allele frequencies, not Lamarckian mechanisms. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n- C: Claims traits are fixed and suggests enzyme evolution instead. Traits are not fixed given standing heritable variation; strong, consistent selection on feeding mechanics makes morphological evolution expected. While other adaptations could occur, the statement that morphology will not change is contradicted by the conditions and quantitative genetic prediction. Hence, C is incorrect.\n- D: Predicts no directional trend due to drift. With strong, consistent selection and a large, genetically diverse founding population, selection overrides drift for these fitness-related traits, producing a predictable directional trend. D is incorrect.\n- E: Predicts more slender, elongated jaws for probing. Probing is not the limiting factor; crushing hard shells is. Slender jaws reduce mechanical advantage and structural robustness, opposing the needed increase in bite force and durability. E contradicts the biomechanical requirements and expected selection gradient.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1969759"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of adaptation, this problem explores a critical consequence of descent with modification: divergence and the potential for speciation. We examine a scenario where a single ancestral population is geographically split and subjected to different environmental challenges. By modeling the change in allele frequencies, this exercise demonstrates how divergent selection acting on isolated populations can drive them down separate evolutionary paths, a primary engine for generating biodiversity [@problem_id:1969774].", "problem": "An ancestral population of flightless beetles inhabits a large, uniform grassland. These beetles possess a single gene $P$ that controls their primary carapace color. The allele $P^L$ results in a light, sandy-colored carapace, while the allele $P^D$ results in a dark, soil-colored carapace. The alleles are co-dominant, such that heterozygous individuals ($P^L P^D$) exhibit a mottled phenotype. In the large ancestral population, which is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the $P^L$ allele is 0.5. Birds that prey on these beetles hunt visually.\n\nA major geological event causes the rapid uplift of a steep, impassable mountain range, dividing the beetle habitat and splitting the ancestral population into two large, completely isolated populations: the Western population and the Eastern population.\n\nOver many generations, the environments of the two regions diverge. The Western region remains a grassland with light, sandy soil, where the $P^L P^L$ phenotype provides the most effective camouflage. The Eastern region, lying in the mountain's rain shadow, transforms into a dense forest with a dark, humus-rich floor covered in leaf litter, where the $P^D P^D$ phenotype offers the most effective camouflage. In both regions, the mottled ($P^L P^D$) phenotype offers intermediate and thus less effective camouflage compared to the better-matched homozygous phenotype for each respective environment.\n\nAssuming that natural selection due to predation is the dominant evolutionary force acting on this trait and that no new mutations arise in the $P$ gene, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected long-term evolutionary trajectory of the two beetle populations?\n\nA. Both populations will maintain the original allele frequencies of the ancestral population, as the two opposing selective pressures will cancel each other out when considering the species as a whole.\n\nB. The Western and Eastern populations will undergo convergent evolution, eventually becoming phenotypically and genetically indistinguishable from each other once again.\n\nC. The Western population will evolve a higher frequency of the $P^L$ allele, while the Eastern population will evolve a higher frequency of the $P^D$ allele. This process will likely lead to the two populations becoming distinct, reproductively isolated species.\n\nD. Both populations will experience random fluctuations in allele frequencies due to genetic drift, with the final outcome being unpredictable and independent of the environmental differences.\n\nE. Individual beetles will adapt their coloration during their lifetimes to better match their new surroundings, and they will pass these acquired traits on to their offspring, leading to phenotypic but not genetic divergence.\n\nF. The $P^L P^D$ heterozygotes will become the most common phenotype in both populations because they carry both alleles, providing greater overall genetic flexibility to adapt to future environmental changes.", "solution": "Let the two alleles be $P^L$ and $P^D$ with frequencies $p$ and $q$, respectively, where $q=1-p$. The ancestral population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with $p_0 = 0.5$, so initial genotype frequencies are $p_0^2$ for $P^L P^L$, $2p_0 q_0$ for $P^L P^D$, and $q_0^2$ for $P^D P^D$.\n\nAfter the mountain uplift, the Western and Eastern populations are completely isolated (no migration), large (genetic drift negligible), and experience different consistent selective regimes due to visually hunting predators. No new mutations arise at the locus $P$, so allele frequency changes are driven by selection alone.\n\nModel viability selection in each region with genotype fitnesses:\n- Western region (light substrate favors $P^L P^L$):\n$$\nW_{LL}=1,\\quad W_{LD}=1-hs_{W},\\quad W_{DD}=1-s_{W},\n$$\nwith $s_W > 0$ and $0  h  1$ to represent that $P^L P^D$ is intermediate in fitness between $P^L P^L$ and $P^D P^D$.\n\n- Eastern region (dark substrate favors $P^D P^D$):\n$$\nW_{DD}=1,\\quad W_{LD}=1-hs_{E},\\quad W_{LL}=1-s_{E},\n$$\nwith $s_E > 0$ and $0  h  1$, again encoding that the heterozygote is intermediate.\n\nFor a given population with allele frequency $p$ of $P^L$ before selection, the post-selection genotype frequencies are proportional to $p^2 W_{LL}$, $2pq W_{LD}$, and $q^2 W_{DD}$, and the mean fitness is\n$$\n\\bar{W}=p^{2}W_{LL}+2pqW_{LD}+q^{2}W_{DD}.\n$$\nThe allele frequency after selection is\n$$\np'=\\frac{p^{2}W_{LL}+pqW_{LD}}{\\bar{W}}.\n$$\nIt is often convenient to compare the average fitnesses carried by each allele:\n$$\nw_{L}=pW_{LL}+qW_{LD},\\qquad w_{D}=pW_{LD}+qW_{DD}.\n$$\nThen $p'=\\frac{p\\,w_{L}}{\\bar{W}}$ and $q'=\\frac{q\\,w_{D}}{\\bar{W}}$, so\n$$\n\\frac{p'}{q'}=\\frac{p}{q}\\cdot\\frac{w_{L}}{w_{D}}.\n$$\n\nWestern region: Because $W_{LL} > W_{LD} > W_{DD}$, it follows for any $0  p  1$ that $w_L > w_D$. Therefore $\\frac{p'}{q'} > \\frac{p}{q}$ and hence $p' > p$ whenever $0  p  1$. Thus selection is directionally increasing $p$ toward fixation at $p=1$; $P^L$ is the globally stable allele and $P^D$ is eliminated in the long run (absent mutation and migration).\n\nEastern region: Here $W_{DD} > W_{LD} > W_{LL}$, so for any $0  p  1$ we have $w_D > w_L$, implying $\\frac{p'}{q'}  \\frac{p}{q}$ and hence $p'  p$. Thus selection is directionally decreasing $p$ toward $p=0$; $P^D$ fixes and $P^L$ is eliminated.\n\nConsequently, in the long term the Western population evolves an increased (ultimately near-fixed) frequency of $P^L$, while the Eastern population evolves an increased (ultimately near-fixed) frequency of $P^D$. Because the populations are completely isolated (allopatry) and experience divergent selection, they will accumulate genetic and phenotypic differences across many loci over time. Such divergence under persistent isolation commonly leads to reproductive isolation and the formation of distinct species; this is the canonical expectation of allopatric divergence driven by local adaptation.\n\nEvaluation of alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because selection acts within each isolated population; “cancellation” across the species as a whole is irrelevant without gene flow.\n- B is incorrect because environments and selective regimes differ; convergent evolution is not expected.\n- D is incorrect because the populations are large and selection is specified as the dominant force; drift does not dominate the outcome.\n- E is incorrect because it invokes inheritance of acquired characters, which is not a valid mechanism of genetic evolution.\n- F is incorrect because heterozygotes have intermediate (not highest) fitness in both regions; they are not expected to become most common due to selection.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the Western population increases the frequency of $P^L$ while the Eastern increases the frequency of $P^D$, with likely long-term speciation under continued isolation and divergent selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1969774"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice shifts from predicting evolutionary trajectories to reconstructing them from observed data.
