This resilience stems from its built-in redundancy, where multiple codons can specify the same amino acid. This exercise [@problem_id:1955412] moves beyond qualitative descriptions to a quantitative exploration of this fundamental property, helping you understand precisely why mutations in the third \"wobble\" position of a codon are often silent compared to those in the first or second positions.", "problem": "The standard genetic code provides the set of rules used by living cells to translate information encoded within messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) into proteins. This translation is performed by reading the sequence of nucleotide bases in groups of three, called codons. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid or a stop signal. A single-nucleotide point mutation is a change in one of these bases.\n\nWe want to quantitatively analyze how the position of a point mutation within a codon affects its likelihood of altering the resulting amino acid. For this analysis, you are provided with the standard mRNA codon table below, which maps all 64 possible codons to their corresponding amino acids or a stop signal.\n\n**Standard mRNA Codon Table:**\n- **Alanine (Ala):** GCU, GCC, GCA, GCG\n- **Arginine (Arg):** CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, AGG\n- **Asparagine (Asn):** AAU, AAC\n- **Aspartic acid (Asp):** GAU, GAC\n- **Cysteine (Cys):** UGU, UGC\n- **Glutamic acid (Glu):** GAA, GAG\n- **Glutamine (Gln):** CAA, CAG\n- **Glycine (Gly):** GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG\n- **Histidine (His):** CAU, CAC\n- **Isoleucine (Ile):** AUU, AUC, AUA\n- **Leucine (Leu):** UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG\n- **Lysine (Lys):** AAA, AAG\n- **Methionine (Met):** AUG\n- **Phenylalanine (Phe):** UUU, UUC\n- **Proline (Pro):** CCU, CCC, CCA, CCG\n- **Serine (Ser):** UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, AGC\n- **Threonine (Thr):** ACU, ACC, ACA, ACG\n- **Tryptophan (Trp):** UGG\n- **Tyrosine (Tyr):** UAU, UAC\n- **Valine (Val):** GUU, GUC, GUA, GUG\n- **STOP:** UAA, UAG, UGA\n\nTo perform the analysis, we make the following simplifying assumptions:\n1. Any of the 64 codons in a coding sequence is equally likely to be the site of a mutation.\n2. The mutation is equally likely to occur at the first, second, or third position of the codon.\n3. When a mutation occurs at a specific base, it changes to any of the other three possible bases with equal probability.\n\nLet $P_1$ be the probability that a random point mutation occurring at the **first** position of a codon results in a change to the encoded amino acid (or a change from an amino acid to a stop signal, or vice-versa).\nLet $P_3$ be the probability that a random point mutation occurring at the **third** position of a codon results in a change to the encoded amino acid (or a change from an amino acid to a stop signal, or vice-versa).\n\nCalculate the ratio $\\frac{P_1}{P_3}$. Report your answer as a single real number, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We model a random point mutation at a fixed codon position as choosing uniformly one of the three alternative bases at that position while holding the other two bases constant. With all codons equally likely, the probability that a mutation is synonymous at a given position equals the total number of synonymous directed single-base changes at that position divided by the total number of possible directed single-base changes at that position, which is $64 \\times 3 = 192$. The desired probability of changing the encoded category (amino acid versus stop) is then one minus this synonymous fraction.\n\nFirst position. Fix positions $2$ and $3$ to a pair $(b_{2},b_{3})$. For each of the $16$ such pairs, consider the quartet $\\{Ub_{2}b_{3},Cb_{2}b_{3},Ab_{2}b_{3},Gb_{2}b_{3}\\}$. A first-position mutation within the quartet is synonymous only if two or more first bases in that quartet code the same category. Inspecting the standard code shows this occurs only in four quartets:\n- $(b_{2},b_{3})=(U,A)$: $UUA$ and $CUA$ are both Leu (2 directed synonymous changes).\n- $(b_{2},b_{3})=(U,G)$: $UUG$ and $CUG$ are both Leu (2).\n- $(b_{2},b_{3})=(G,A)$: $CGA$ and $AGA$ are both Arg (2).\n- $(b_{2},b_{3})=(G,G)$: $CGG$ and $AGG$ are both Arg (2).\nAll other $(b_{2},b_{3})$ quartets have four distinct categories for the four first bases. Thus the total number of synonymous directed first-position changes is\n$$\nS_{1}=2+2+2+2=8.\n$$\nHence\n$$\nP_{1}=1-\\frac{S_{1}}{192}=1-\\frac{8}{192}=\\frac{23}{24}.\n$$\n\nThird position. Fix the first two bases $(b_{1},b_{2})$ to one of $16$ boxes. Within each box, the four third-base variants partition into groups by encoded category. If a group has size $s$, it contributes $s(s-1)$ directed synonymous changes. Summing $s(s-1)$ over groups in each box gives:\n- Fourfold-degenerate boxes (all four third bases synonymous): $UC,CU,CC,CG,AC,GU,GC,GG$ each contribute $12$; total $96$.\n- Two-by-two split boxes: $UU$ (Phe vs Leu), $UA$ (Tyr vs Stop), $CA$ (His vs Gln), $AA$ (Asn vs Lys), $AG$ (Ser vs Arg), $GA$ (Asp vs Glu) each contribute $4$; total $24$.\n- Mixed $UG$ (Cys doublet; Trp and Stop singletons) contributes $2$.\n- $AU$ (Ile triplet; Met singleton) contributes $6$.\nThus the total number of synonymous directed third-position changes is\n$$\nS_{3}=96+24+2+6=128,\n$$\nand\n$$\nP_{3}=1-\\frac{S_{3}}{192}=1-\\frac{128}{192}=\\frac{1}{3}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the requested ratio is\n$$\n\\frac{P_{1}}{P_{3}}=\\frac{\\frac{23}{24}}{\\frac{1}{3}}=\\frac{23}{8}=2.875,\n$$\nwhich rounded to three significant figures is $2.88$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.88}$$", "id": "1955412"}, {"introduction": "If point mutations are like single-letter typos, insertions and deletions can scramble the message entirely by shifting the translational \"reading frame.\" This exercise [@problem_id:1955340] presents a molecular puzzle where a frameshift mutation is followed by a second mutation that partially restores the original meaning.
