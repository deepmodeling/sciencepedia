This first practice demonstrates a fundamental molecular technique, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), used to identify a small chromosomal deletion. By analyzing the results of a simulated gel electrophoresis, you will learn how fragment size differences can reveal an individual's genotype, a core skill in modern genetics and evolutionary biology [@problem_id:1913714].", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is studying a population of fictional tree frogs, *Hyla spectacula*. They are investigating a specific gene, *Chroma1*, which is involved in skin pigmentation. There are two common alleles for this gene in the population: the wild-type allele, denoted as $C^+$, and a mutant allele, denoted as $C^-$. The $C^-$ allele contains a small, in-frame deletion of 150 base pairs (bp) compared to the $C^+$ allele.\n\nTo determine the genotype of individual frogs, the researchers have designed a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based assay. They use a single pair of primers that flank the region where the deletion occurs. The DNA sequence amplified from the wild-type allele ($C^+$) is exactly 850 bp long. The PCR products are then separated by size using agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nThe researchers test four frogs from the population (Sample 1, Sample 2, Sample 3, and Sample 4). The results of the gel electrophoresis are described below:\n\n*   **Sample 1:** Shows a single DNA band at a size of 850 bp.\n*   **Sample 2:** Shows two distinct DNA bands, one at 850 bp and one at 700 bp.\n*   **Sample 3:** Shows a single DNA band at a size of 700 bp.\n*   **Sample 4:** Shows two distinct DNA bands, one at 850 bp and one at 700 bp.\n\nBased on these results, identify the correct genotype for each of the four samples. The possible genotypes are homozygous wild-type ($C^+/C^+$), heterozygous ($C^+/C^-$), and homozygous mutant ($C^-/C^-$).\n\nA.

In this exercise, you will act as a comparative biologist, using synteny plots—maps of conserved gene blocks—to deduce the large-scale rearrangements that separate two species. This practice hones your logical reasoning skills by applying the principle of parsimony to reconstruct the evolutionary history of inversions and translocations from genomic data [@problem_id:1913712].", "problem": "Two closely related species of flowering plants, *Floris orientalis* and *Floris occidentalis*, have been sequenced and their genomes compared. Evolutionary biologists are interested in reconstructing the large-scale chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred since they diverged from a common ancestor. They have identified ten large, conserved blocks of genes, called synteny blocks, and labeled them A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J.\n\nIn *Floris orientalis*, which is believed to retain a state similar to the common ancestor, the genome consists of two chromosomes with the following synteny block order:\n- Chromosome 1: `A-B-C-D-E-F`\n- Chromosome 2: `G-H-I-J`\n\nIn *Floris occidentalis*, the genome also consists of two chromosomes, but the arrangement of synteny blocks is different:\n- Chromosome X: `A-E-D-C-J`\n- Chromosome Y: `G-H-I-B-F`\n\nA chromosomal inversion is a rearrangement in which a segment of a chromosome is reversed end to end. A reciprocal translocation is an event where segments are exchanged between two non-homologous chromosomes. Assuming that evolution proceeds with the minimum number of changes (the principle of parsimony), determine the most likely sequence of these two types of large-scale rearrangements that could explain the transformation from the ancestral genome to the one seen in *Floris occidentalis*.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of inversions and reciprocal translocations required?\n\nA. Two inversions and one reciprocal translocation.\n\nB. One inversion and two reciprocal translocations.\n\nC. One inversion and one reciprocal translocation.\n\nD. Two inversions and two reciprocal translocations.\n\nE. Zero inversions and two reciprocal translocations.", "solution": "Principles used:\n- An inversion reverses the order of a contiguous segment within a single chromosome.\n- A reciprocal translocation exchanges contiguous segments between two non-homologous chromosomes.\n- Parsimony requires minimizing the total number of such events.\n\nStart from the ancestral configuration (similar to Floris orientalis):\n- Chromosome 1: `A-B-C-D-E-F`\n- Chromosome 2: `G-H-I-J`\n\nGoal (Floris occidentalis):\n- Chromosome X: `A-E-D-C-J`\n- Chromosome Y: `G-H-I-B-F`\n\nConstructive minimal sequence:\n1) Perform a single inversion on Chromosome 1 reversing the contiguous segment `B-C-D-E`. This yields:\n- Chromosome 1: `A-E-D-C-B-F`\n- Chromosome 2: `G-H-I-J`\nNow, the blocks `B` and `F` are adjacent, forming a contiguous segment `B-F`.\n\n2) Perform one reciprocal translocation exchanging the contiguous segment `B-F` on Chromosome 1 with the contiguous segment `J` on Chromosome 2. This yields:\n- Chromosome 1: `A-E-D-C-J`\n- Chromosome 2: `G-H-I-B-F`\nwhich matches the target arrangement exactly.\n\nMinimality argument:\n- In the final state, `J` moves from Chromosome 2 to Chromosome 1, while `B` and `F` move from Chromosome 1 to Chromosome 2. Since reciprocal translocations exchange contiguous segments, to move both `B` and `F` together in a single translocation they must be contiguous at the time of exchange. In the ancestor, `B` and `F` are separated by `C-D-E`. Therefore, without first making `B` and `F` contiguous by an inversion, a single translocation would necessarily also move `C-D-E`, contradicting the final partition unless additional events occur. Hence with only one translocation, at least one inversion is necessary.\n- Using two translocations with zero inversions cannot simultaneously move only `B` and `F` (non-contiguous) to Chromosome 2 while leaving `C-D-E` on Chromosome 1 and keeping `G-H-I` on Chromosome 2; moving `B` and `F` separately would require at least two exchanges from Chromosome 1 and at least one exchange to introduce `J` onto Chromosome 1, totaling at least three translocations. Thus two translocations without inversions are insufficient.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is $1$ inversion and $1$ reciprocal translocation, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1913712"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying mutations, it is crucial to understand their consequences for an organism's fitness. This final practice challenges you to build a quantitative model that predicts the impact of a pericentric inversion on gamete viability. By relating the physical length of the inverted segment, $I = b_p + b_q$, to the probability of producing aneuploid gametes, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how chromosomal structure directly affects fertility and can act as a mechanism for reproductive isolation [@problem_id:1913696].", "problem": "In a species of diploid rodent, a population exists where some individuals are heterozygous for a large pericentric inversion on one of their autosomes. Your task is to develop a simple mathematical model for the fitness cost associated with this heterozygosity.\n\nConsider a single chromosome pair in one of these heterozygous individuals. The chromosome consists of a short arm (p-arm) of length $L_p$ and a long arm (q-arm) of length $L_q$. The centromere is located at the junction of these two arms. In the inverted chromosome, the breakpoints occurred at a distance $b_p$ from the centromere along the p-arm and at a distance $b_q$ from the centromere along the q-arm, with $0 < b_p \\leq L_p$ and $0 < b_q \\leq L_q$. The segment between these two breakpoints, which includes the centromere, is inverted.\n\nAssume the following for your model:\n1.  During meiosis, the probability that exactly one chiasma (the result of a single crossover) forms anywhere along this specific chromosome pair is a constant, $P_c$.\n2.  The position of this single crossover is uniformly distributed per unit of physical length along the entire chromosome.\n3.  A single crossover occurring within the inverted segment of the meiotic pairing loop leads to the formation of two parental gametes (one with the normal chromosome, one with the inverted chromosome) and two aneuploid gametes (each containing a chromosome with a duplication of one terminal region and a deletion of the other).\n4.  Meioses with zero crossovers or more than one crossover on this chromosome pair do not produce any aneuploid gametes.\n\nBased on this model, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the total proportion of gametes produced by this heterozygous individual that will be aneuploid.", "solution": "Let the total physical length of the chromosome be $L=L_{p}+L_{q}$. The inverted segment spans from a point $b_{p}$ from the centromere along the p-arm through the centromere to a point $b_{q}$ from the centromere along the q-arm, so its length is $I=b_{p}+b_{q}$.\n\nBy assumption 1, the probability that exactly one chiasma forms on this chromosome pair is $P_{c}$. By assumption 2, conditional on there being exactly one crossover, its position is uniformly distributed along length $L$, so the probability that this crossover falls within the inverted segment is $I/L=(b_{p}+b_{q})/(L_{p}+L_{q})$.\n\nBy assumption 3, a single crossover within the inverted segment produces two aneuploid gametes among the four products, i.e., a fraction $1/2$ of the gametes from such a meiosis are aneuploid. By assumption 4, all other meioses (zero or more than one crossover on this pair) produce no aneuploid gametes.\n\nTherefore, by the law of total probability, the total proportion of gametes that are aneuploid is\n$$\nP_{\\text{aneuploid}}=P_{c}\\cdot \\frac{b_{p}+b_{q}}{L_{p}+L_{q}}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nSimplifying gives\n$$\nP_{\\text{aneuploid}}=\\frac{P_{c}\\left(b_{p}+b_{q}\\right)}{2\\left(L_{p}+L_{q}\\right)}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{P_{c}\\left(b_{p}+b_{q}\\right)}{2\\left(L_{p}+L_{q}\\right)}}$$", "id": "1913696"}]}
