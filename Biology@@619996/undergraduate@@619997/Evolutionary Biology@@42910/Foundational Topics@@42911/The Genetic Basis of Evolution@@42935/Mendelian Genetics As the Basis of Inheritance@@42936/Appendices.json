A primary germline cell from a heterozygous plant ($Pp$) enters meiosis to produce four gametes. For the purpose of this question, assume that no new mutations arise during the process. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the specific meiotic event that is the physical basis for the segregation of the $P$ and $p$ alleles into different gametes, as predicted by the chromosomal theory of inheritance?\n\nA. The process of DNA replication in the S phase, where the chromosome carrying the $P$ allele and the chromosome carrying the $p$ allele are both duplicated.\n\nB. The separation of homologous chromosomes during anaphase I.\n\nC. The alignment of individual chromosomes along the metaphase plate during metaphase II.\n\nD. The separation of sister chromatids during anaphase II.\n\nE. The exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes (crossing over) during prophase I.", "solution": "We consider a single locus with two alleles, $P$ (dominant) and $p$ (recessive), in a heterozygous plant with genotype $Pp$. Under the chromosomal theory of inheritance, each allele resides on one member of a homologous chromosome pair: one homolog carries the $P$ allele and the other homolog carries the $p$ allele.\n\nBefore meiosis, during the S phase, each chromosome is replicated so that each homolog becomes two sister chromatids. Specifically, the $P$-bearing chromosome becomes two sister chromatids both carrying $P$, and the $p$-bearing chromosome becomes two sister chromatids both carrying $p$. This DNA replication duplicates alleles but does not separate them into different cells, so it is not the physical basis of segregation. Therefore, option A is not correct.\n\nDuring meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair in prophase I and align as bivalents at the metaphase plate in metaphase I. The key event for Mendelâ€™s law of segregation is anaphase I, when homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles. At this moment, the $P$-bearing homolog and the $p$-bearing homolog are physically segregated into different daughter cells. This separation of homologs is the physical basis for the segregation of alleles into different gametes as predicted by the chromosomal theory. Therefore, option B correctly identifies the event.\n\nBy contrast, metaphase II involves the alignment of individual chromosomes (each typically with two sister chromatids) at the metaphase II plate, but alignment itself does not effect segregation of alleles; hence option C does not describe the basis of segregation.\n\nAnaphase II is the separation of sister chromatids. In a standard meiosis without recombination within the locus, the two sister chromatids of a given chromosome carry the same allele at that locus (both $P$ or both $p$), so their separation does not constitute the initial segregation of the $P$ and $p$ alleles. Even if crossing over occurred between the locus and the centromere, the law of segregation still fundamentally arises from the separation of homologs in anaphase I; anaphase II resolves sister chromatids. Therefore, option D is not the primary physical basis of segregation.\n\nCrossing over during prophase I (option E) exchanges genetic material between homologs and increases genetic variation by recombining linked loci, but it is not necessary for nor does it constitute the segregation of alleles at a single locus. Segregation occurs whether or not crossing over takes place. Thus, option E is not correct.\n\nHence, the specific meiotic event that physically underlies allele segregation is the separation of homologous chromosomes in anaphase I.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1524330"}, {"introduction": "The segregation of alleles is a fundamentally random process, and this chance has significant consequences at the population level. This practice problem allows you to quantify the effect of genetic drift, a powerful evolutionary force, in a very small founding population. You will calculate the probability that an allele is lost purely by the random sampling of gametes, illustrating how Mendelian inheritance itself can drive evolutionary change [@problem_id:1946914].", "problem": "A conservation program initiates a new, isolated population of an endangered diploid species, the Azure Fritillary butterfly. The founding population consists of a single breeding pair: one male and one female (total population size $N=2$). Genetic screening shows that for a specific gene locus controlling antennal segment number, both founding butterflies are heterozygous. Let the two alleles at this locus be denoted by $B$ and $b$. Thus, both parents have the genotype $Bb$. These alleles are known to be selectively neutral.\n\nThe pair mates and produces a large number of offspring, from which two individuals survive to form the next generation, maintaining the constant population size of $N=2$. Assuming the gametes that form the offspring are a random draw from the parental gene pool, what is the probability that the allele $b$ is completely lost in this new generation? Express your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "Both founders are heterozygous $Bb$, so the parental gene pool contains $2N=4$ gene copies: two $B$ alleles and two $b$ alleles. Thus the allele frequency of $b$ in the parental generation is $p=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe next generation consists of two diploid individuals, i.e., $2N=4$ gene copies. Under random mating and random union of gametes (selective neutrality and no segregation distortion), each of these $4$ gene copies is an independent draw from the parental gene pool with probability $p=\\frac{1}{2}$ of being $b$ and probability $1-p=\\frac{1}{2}$ of being $B$. Therefore, the number of $b$ alleles in the next generation, denoted $X$, follows a binomial distribution:\n$$\nX \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(4, p).\n$$\nComplete loss of $b$ in the new generation means $X=0$. Hence,\n$$\n\\Pr(\\text{$b$ lost})=\\Pr(X=0)=\\binom{4}{0}p^{0}(1-p)^{4}=(1-p)^{4}.\n$$\nSubstituting $p=\\frac{1}{2}$ gives\n$$\n\\Pr(\\text{$b$ lost})=\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4}=\\frac{1}{16}.\n$$\n\nEquivalently, considering Mendelian genotypes: each offspring of two $Bb$ parents is $BB$ with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. Two independently chosen survivors are both $BB$ with probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{1}{16}$, which implies loss of $b$ in the new generation, consistent with the binomial calculation above.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$$", "id": "1946914"}, {"introduction": "Evolution often involves changes at multiple gene loci, where interactions between genes, known as epistasis, can create complex fitness landscapes. This problem explores how recombination, a key feature of Mendelian genetics, can be a double-edged sword: while it can create advantageous new gene combinations, it can also break them apart. By determining a critical recombination rate $r_c$, you will investigate the conditions under which a population can successfully cross a \"fitness valley\" to reach an adaptive peak [@problem_id:1946930].", "problem": "In a haploid organism, a simple model for the evolution of a complex trait involves two gene loci, A and B. The wild-type genotype is denoted as `ab`. A mutation at the first locus gives rise to genotype `Ab`, a mutation at the second locus gives rise to `aB`, and mutations at both loci give rise to `AB`.\n\nThe fitness landscape exhibits strong sign epistasis. The wild-type `ab` has a relative fitness of $w_{ab}=1$. The single-mutant genotypes, `Ab` and `aB`, are deleterious and have an equal fitness of $w_{Ab} = w_{aB} = 1-s$, where $s$ is a positive constant representing a selective disadvantage. The double-mutant genotype `AB`, however, is the most fit, with a fitness of $w_{AB} = 1+K$, where $K$ is a positive constant representing a strong synergistic benefit. The recombination rate between the two loci is denoted by $r$.\n\nConsider a large population initially at or near fixation for the `ab` genotype. To evolve to the globally optimal `AB` genotype, the population must cross a \"fitness valley\" created by the deleterious intermediate genotypes. Recombination can play a dual role: it can generate the `AB` genotype from the intermediates, but it can also break apart the `AB` combination, a phenomenon known as recombination load.\n\nThere exists a critical recombination rate, $r_c$, above which the recombination load is so strong that it prevents the `AB` genotype from successfully invading, effectively trapping the population at the local fitness peak of the `ab` genotype. For any recombination rate $r > r_c$, the population cannot reach the optimal `AB` state.\n\nDetermine the expression for this critical recombination rate $r_c$ in terms of the given fitness parameters.", "solution": "Let the haplotype frequencies be denoted by $x_{ab}, x_{Ab}, x_{aB}, x_{AB}$, with fitnesses $w_{ab}=1$, $w_{Ab}=w_{aB}=1-s$, and $w_{AB}=1+K$.

Let $x_{AB}=\\epsilon$ with $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, and $x_{ab}=1-\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$. The single mutants $x_{Ab}, x_{aB}$ are at most of order $\\epsilon$ and their product is of order $\\epsilon^{2}$, which will be negligible at linear order.\n\nCompute the post-selection quantities to first order in $\\epsilon$. The mean fitness is $\\bar{w}=1+\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$, so\n$$\nx_{AB}^{s}=\\frac{(1+K)x_{AB}}{\\bar{w}}=(1+K)x_{AB}+\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{2}).\n$$\nSince $x_{ab}^{s}=\\frac{1\\cdot x_{ab}}{\\bar{w}}=1+\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$, we have, to linear order,\n$$\nD^{s}=x_{AB}^{s}x_{ab}^{s}-x_{Ab}^{s}x_{aB}^{s}=(1+K)x_{AB}+\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{2}).\n$$\nApplying recombination,\n$$\nx_{AB}'=x_{AB}^{s}-r D^{s}=(1+K)x_{AB}-r(1+K)x_{AB}=(1+K)(1-r)x_{AB}+\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{2}).\n$$\nTherefore, the per-generation multiplicative growth factor of the rare $AB$ haplotype is $(1+K)(1-r)$.
