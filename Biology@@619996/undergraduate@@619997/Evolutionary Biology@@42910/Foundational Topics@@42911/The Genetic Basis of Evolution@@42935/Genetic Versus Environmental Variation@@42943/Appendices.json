The key performance indicator for this strain is the rate of acetylene reduction, which serves as a proxy for nitrogen fixation activity. This rate is measured in nanomoles of ethylene produced per hour per milligram of protein (nmol C₂H₄ / (hr·mg protein)). From a large, genetically diverse population of this bacterium cultured under controlled but variable field-simulated conditions, the total phenotypic variance ($V_p$) for this trait was measured to be 225.0 $(\\text{units})^2$, where \"units\" refers to the complex unit of measurement. Through a series of parent-offspring regression analyses, the narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) was determined to be 0.40.

The fundamental relationship in quantitative genetics partitions the total phenotypic variance ($V_p$) into its genetic and environmental components.

All plants in the study population are located on a single, isolated mountain slope with remarkably uniform soil composition, sunlight exposure, and water availability.

A heritability of 0.95 means that 95% of any individual plant's height is determined by its genes, and only 5% is determined by its environment.\n\nB.

Heritability is a property of a specific population in a specific environment and concerns variance among individuals, not the causal fraction of an individual’s phenotype.\n\nIn the described study, all plants are on a single slope with uniform soil, light, and water, implying $V_{E}$ is small. Consequently, $H^{2}$ can be high (here $0.95$) because $V_{P}$ is dominated by $V_{G}$ under these conditions.

Heritability partitions variance among individuals in a population; it does not apportion causation within an individual.\n\nB is incorrect because high heritability does not imply environmental interventions cannot shift the population mean. A strong environmental change (e.g., a fertilizer) can alter the mean substantially even when $H^{2}$ is high; $H^{2}$ is about variance, not mean sensitivity.\n\nC is incorrect because the effectiveness of selective breeding depends on narrow-sense heritability $h^{2} = V_{A}/V_{P}$ and the breeder’s equation $R = h^{2} S$, where $R$ is the response and $S$ is the selection differential. A high $H^{2}$ does not imply low $h^{2}$ nor that selection would be ineffective; no conclusion about breeding efficacy can be drawn from $H^{2}$ alone.\n\nD is correct. The high $H^{2}$ was measured in a context of low environmental variance; a major environmental change (e.g., applying a new fertilizer) could still cause a large change in the average height, because heritability does not limit shifts in the mean under new environments and is environment-specific.\n\nE is incorrect because acquired changes due to environmental inputs are not inherited unless they alter germline genotypes; standard quantitative genetics rejects inheritance of acquired characteristics.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and logical conclusion from the provided information is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1946487"}]}
