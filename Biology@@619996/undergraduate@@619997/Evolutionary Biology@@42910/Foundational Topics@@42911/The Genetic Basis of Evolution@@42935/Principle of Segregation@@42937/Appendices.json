Consider a single diploid germ-line cell from a heterozygous plant ($Dd$) that is undergoing meiosis to produce pollen grains (microspores, which are gametes).\n\nAssume that during this specific meiotic division, a nondisjunction event occurs.

Before meiosis begins, DNA replication occurs during the S phase of interphase. The homologous chromosomes replicate, each now consisting of two identical sister chromatids. So, we have one replicated chromosome carrying two $D$ alleles and its homologous partner carrying two $d$ alleles.\n\nMeiosis I is the reductional division where homologous chromosomes separate. The heterozygous cell ($Dd$) will divide to produce two secondary meiocytes. One secondary meiocyte will receive the replicated chromosome with the $D$ alleles, and the other will receive the homologous replicated chromosome with the $d$ alleles. Both of these secondary meiocytes are haploid in terms of chromosome number, but each chromosome still consists of two chromatids.\n\nSo, after Meiosis I, we have:\n- One secondary meiocyte with a replicated chromosome carrying two $D$ chromatids.\n- One secondary meiocyte with a replicated chromosome carrying two $d$ chromatids.\n\n**Step 2: Meiosis II with Nondisjunction**\nMeiosis II is an equational division where sister chromatids separate. The problem states that one secondary meiocyte divides normally, while the other undergoes nondisjunction. Let's analyze both scenarios.\n\n**Scenario A: Normal Meiosis II**\nLet's assume the secondary meiocyte with the replicated chromosome carrying the $d$ alleles divides normally. The sister chromatids separate, and each resulting cell (now a gamete) receives one chromosome with a single $d$ allele.\n- Result: Two gametes, both with genotype $d$.\n\n**Scenario B: Meiosis II with Nondisjunction**\nThe other secondary meiocyte, which contains the replicated chromosome with the $D$ alleles, undergoes nondisjunction. This means the sister chromatids fail to separate. Both sister chromatids move to the same pole and end up in the same gamete. The other resulting cell from this division receives no chromosome for this gene.\n- Result: One gamete that is disomic for this chromosome (genotype $DD$) and one gamete that is nullisomic (lacks the chromosome entirely, genotype denoted as '0' or null).\n\n**Step 3: Combining the Results**\nTo find the set of four gametes produced from the entire meiotic event, we combine the outcomes from both secondary meiocytes.\n- From the normally dividing cell: two gametes of genotype $d$.\n- From the nondisjunction cell: one gamete of genotype $DD$ and one nullisomic gamete.\n\nTherefore, the four resulting gametes have the genotypes: $DD$, nullisomic, $d$, and $d$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\nLet's compare our derived set of genotypes with the given choices.\n\nA. Two gametes with genotype $D$, and two gametes with genotype $d$. This is the outcome of a completely normal meiotic division, without any nondisjunction. This is incorrect.\n\nB. One pollen grain with genotype $DD$, one pollen grain that is nullisomic for this gene (lacks the chromosome), and two pollen grains with genotype $d$. This matches our derived result. Note that if the nondisjunction had occurred in the other secondary meiocyte (the one with the $d$ allele), the outcome would be two $D$ gametes, one $dd$ gamete, and one nullisomic gamete. Option B describes one of the two possible valid outcomes. This is correct.\n\nC. Two pollen grains with genotype $Dd$, and two pollen grains that are nullisomic for this gene. This is the characteristic outcome of nondisjunction of homologous chromosomes during Meiosis I, not Meiosis II. This is incorrect.\n\nD. Two pollen grains with genotype $DD$, and two pollen grains with genotype $dd$. This would imply that nondisjunction occurred in both secondary meiocytes, which is not what the problem describes. This is incorrect.\n\nE. One pollen grain with genotype $D$, one pollen grain with genotype $d$, one pollen grain with genotype $Dd$, and one pollen grain that is nullisomic for this gene. This set of genotypes is inconsistent with any single nondisjunction event and represents a misunderstanding of the process. This is incorrect.\n\nThe correct choice is B, as it accurately describes the products of a Meiosis II nondisjunction event in one of the two secondary meiocytes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1957523"}]}
