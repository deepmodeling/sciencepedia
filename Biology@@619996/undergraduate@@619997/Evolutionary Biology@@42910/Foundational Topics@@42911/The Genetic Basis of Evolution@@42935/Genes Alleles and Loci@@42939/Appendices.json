This practice provides a foundational exercise in population genetics: calculating allele frequencies directly from observed genotype counts.

The petal texture is determined by a single gene at the `Tex` locus, which has two alleles: a dominant allele `T` that codes for iridescent petals, and a recessive allele `t` that codes for matte petals. Individuals can therefore have one of three genotypes: `TT` (iridescent), `Tt` (iridescent), or `tt` (matte). The biologist surveys a sample of 250 plants from this population and records their genotypes. The sample consists of 110 homozygous dominant (`TT`) plants, 95 heterozygous (`Tt`) plants, and 45 homozygous recessive (`tt`) plants.\n\nBased on this sample, calculate the frequency of the recessive allele `t` in the population.

The Hardy-Weinberg principle provides a powerful mathematical model for this, but its application depends on a specific set of ideal conditions. This exercise challenges you to think critically about these assumptions, identifying the scenario where the principle serves as a reliable null hypothesis to connect allele frequencies to genotype frequencies [@problem_id:1932658].", "problem": "In a laboratory setting, a large, stable population of the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* is maintained under conditions that approximate the assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg principle. Within this population, a single gene controls eye color. The allele for red eyes, denoted by `R`, is completely dominant over the allele for white eyes, denoted by `r`.\n\nA research team initiates an experiment by creating five smaller, isolated populations from this large ancestral stock. Each new population is subjected to a different experimental condition for 50 generations. After this period, the team finds that in one specific experimental population, the frequency of the `R` allele is 0.7. However, the logbook detailing the experimental condition for this specific population has been corrupted, leaving only a single descriptive sentence.\n\nAssuming no new mutations occurred unless explicitly stated, which one of the following five possible logbook entries describes a scenario where the frequency of heterozygous flies (`Rr`) can be most reliably estimated using only the measured allele frequency?\n\nA. \"Strong selection was imposed: flies with white eyes (`rr`) had a 50% higher reproductive success rate compared to red-eyed flies (`RR` and `Rr`).\"\n\nB. \"To study genetic drift, the population size was intentionally kept small, with only 20 randomly chosen individuals contributing to each subsequent generation.\"\n\nC. \"The population was part of a migration study; each generation, 25% of the breeding individuals were replaced with flies from a separate population where the allele `r` is fixed.\"\n\nD. \"A behavioral study on mating choice was conducted, where red-eyed females were exclusively paired with white-eyed males, and white-eyed females were exclusively paired with red-eyed males.\"\n\nE. \"The population was maintained at a very large size (over 10,000 individuals), and flies were observed to mate at random with respect to eye color.\"", "solution": "The central task is to identify the scenario in which the population's genotype frequencies can be reliably predicted from its allele frequencies. This prediction is based on the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) principle. The HWE model states that in the absence of evolutionary influences, both allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation. For a gene with two alleles, `R` (frequency $p$) and `r` (frequency $q$), the genotype frequencies at equilibrium are given by $p^2$ for `RR`, $2pq$ for `Rr`, and $q^2$ for `rr`.\n\nThis model rests on five key assumptions:\n1.  No natural selection: All genotypes have equal survival and reproductive rates.\n2.  No genetic drift: The population is infinitely large, so random chance does not change allele frequencies.\n3.  No gene flow: There is no migration of individuals into or out of the population.\n4.  No new mutations: Alleles do not change from one state to another.\n5.  Random mating: Individuals mate randomly, without regard to their genotype or phenotype.\n\nIf any of these assumptions are significantly violated, the population will not be in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, and the genotype frequencies cannot be calculated simply as $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$. We must analyze each option to see which one best approximates these conditions. The problem provides the final allele frequency of `R` as $p=0.7$, which implies the frequency of `r` is $q = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3$. We are looking for the scenario where the frequency of heterozygotes (`Rr`) can be confidently estimated as $2pq = 2(0.7)(0.3) = 0.42$.\n\nLet's evaluate each logbook entry:\n\n*   **Option A:** This entry describes strong natural selection. The `rr` genotype has a significantly higher reproductive success. This directly violates the \"no selection\" assumption of HWE. When selection is acting, the genotype frequencies will deviate from HWE proportions, as some genotypes contribute more to the next generation than others. Therefore, we cannot reliably estimate the heterozygote frequency using $2pq$.\n\n*   **Option B:** This entry describes a small population size (N=20). In such a small population, random chance plays a large role in which alleles get passed to the next generation. This phenomenon is known as genetic drift. Genetic drift causes allele frequencies to fluctuate unpredictably and is a strong violation of the \"large population size\" assumption. The genotype frequencies in any given generation are unlikely to match the HWE expectation.\n\n*   **Option C:** This entry describes a high rate of gene flow (migration). A quarter of the population is replaced each generation by individuals from a population with a different allele frequency (where `r` is fixed, meaning $q=1$). This constant influx of new alleles is a major evolutionary force that changes the population's allele and genotype frequencies, violating the \"no gene flow\" assumption. HWE does not apply.\n\n*   **Option D:** This entry describes a specific, non-random mating system. Pairing red-eyed flies (`RR` or `Rr`) exclusively with white-eyed flies (`rr`) is a form of negative (or disassortative) mating. This system strongly violates the \"random mating\" assumption. While this specific mating scheme does not change allele frequencies in the population as a whole, it drastically alters genotype frequencies by systematically increasing the frequency of heterozygotes well above the $2pq$ expectation.\n\n*   **Option E:** This entry describes a scenario that aligns well with the HWE assumptions. The population is \"very large,\" which minimizes the effects of genetic drift. Mating is explicitly stated to be \"at random,\" satisfying the random mating assumption. The problem states to assume no mutations unless specified, and this option does not mention gene flow or selection. Therefore, this scenario is the only one where the primary evolutionary forces are absent or minimized. Under these conditions, the population would be in, or very close to, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Consequently, one can reliably use the allele frequencies to calculate the expected genotype frequencies, including the frequency of heterozygotes as $2pq$.\n\nIn conclusion, only the scenario described in option E meets the necessary conditions for the Hardy-Weinberg principle to be a reliable model for estimating genotype frequencies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1932658"}, {"introduction": "Genes do not always exist in isolation; the association between alleles at different loci can reveal important evolutionary histories. This practice moves beyond single-locus analysis to introduce the concept of gametic disequilibrium ($D$), a measure of non-random association between alleles.
