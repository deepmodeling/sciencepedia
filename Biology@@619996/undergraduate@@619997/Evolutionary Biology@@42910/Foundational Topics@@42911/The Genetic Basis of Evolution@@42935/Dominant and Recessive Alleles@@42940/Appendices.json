By understanding this equilibrium, we can quantify the genetic makeup of a population and identify when evolutionary forces are at play. This practice will guide you through using the Hardy-Weinberg equations to deduce the frequency of heterozygous carriers, whose dominant allele masks a recessive one, based solely on the number of individuals expressing the recessive phenotype [@problem_id:1920474].", "problem": "In a stable deep-sea trench, an isolated population of a recently discovered gastropod species, *Abyssopoda nacre*, is being studied. This species exhibits a simple Mendelian trait for shell texture, which can be either smooth or ridged. The allele for smooth shells, denoted by $S$, is completely dominant over the allele for ridged shells, denoted by $s$.\n\nA comprehensive survey of the population was conducted. Biologists counted a total of 10,000 individuals. Among them, 2,500 gastropods were found to have ridged shells. Based on long-term observation, it is reasonable to assume that the population is large, individuals mate randomly with respect to shell texture, and there are no significant evolutionary influences such as mutation, gene flow, or natural selection acting on this specific gene locus.\n\nCalculate the expected frequency of heterozygous individuals in this population. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "The assumptions imply Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Let $p$ be the allele frequency of $S$ and $q$ the allele frequency of $s$, with $p+q=1$. Under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, genotype frequencies are $p^{2}$ for $SS$, $2pq$ for $Ss$, and $q^{2}$ for $ss$.\n\nRidged shells correspond to the recessive genotype $ss$, so their frequency equals $q^{2}$. The observed frequency of ridged individuals is\n$$\nq^{2}=\\frac{2500}{10000}=0.25.\n$$\nTaking the nonnegative square root (since frequencies are nonnegative),\n$$\nq=\\sqrt{0.25}=0.5,\n$$\nand therefore\n$$\np=1-q=0.5.\n$$\nThe expected frequency of heterozygotes is\n$$\n2pq=2\\cdot 0.5\\cdot 0.5=0.5.\n$$\nThus, the heterozygote frequency is $0.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "1920474"}, {"introduction": "Real populations are rarely in perfect equilibrium; they are shaped by evolutionary forces like natural selection. This exercise moves from the static Hardy-Weinberg model to a dynamic scenario, allowing you to model the direct impact of selection. You will use the concept of a selection coefficient ($s$) to quantify the pressure against a deleterious recessive allele and calculate how its frequency shifts in a single generation, which is a fundamental skill in studying adaptation [@problem_id:1920463].", "problem": "In a large, randomly mating population of bacteria, a gene controlling resistance to a newly introduced bacteriostatic agent exists with two alleles: a dominant allele A for resistance and a recessive allele a for susceptibility.

Initially, before significant selection has occurred, the frequency of the susceptible allele a in the population is $0.40$. The bacteriostatic agent is then introduced, imposing a selection pressure corresponding to a selection coefficient of $s = 0.25$.\n\nAssuming the population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium before the introduction of the agent, calculate the frequency of the susceptible allele a in the very next generation.

This critical distinction is explored in this thought-provoking exercise, which challenges the simple assumption that all harmful alleles are efficiently removed from a population.

Their research has established the following key characteristics:\n\n1.  CAD is an autosomal dominant disorder. The disease-causing allele is denoted as $C$, and the normal, recessive allele is denoted as $c$. An individual with at least one $C$ allele will develop the disease.\n2.  The disease is severe, causing progressive neurodegeneration that is ultimately fatal.\n3.  The onset of symptoms for CAD reliably occurs only after the age of 60.\n4.

The frequency of the $C$ allele will be drastically reduced and likely eliminated over many generations because its severe, fatal effects will be strongly selected against.\n\nB. The frequency of the $C$ allele will remain relatively stable, as natural selection will not act strongly against it.\n\nC. The frequency of the $C$ allele will increase until it becomes the more common allele, because there is no selective pressure to remove it.\n\nD.
