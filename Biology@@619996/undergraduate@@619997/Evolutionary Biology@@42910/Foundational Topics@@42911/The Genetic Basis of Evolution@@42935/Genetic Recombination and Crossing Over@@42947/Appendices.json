This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to translate raw experimental data into a fundamental measure of genetic linkage.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the inheritance of two traits in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*: eye color and wing shape. The allele for wild-type red eyes ($pr^+$) is dominant over the allele for purple eyes ($pr$), and the allele for wild-type normal wings ($vg^+$) is dominant over the allele for vestigial wings ($vg$).\n\nThe biologist performs a standard genetic cross. First, a pure-breeding fly with red eyes and normal wings is crossed with a pure-breeding fly with purple eyes and vestigial wings. This produces an F1 generation where all individuals have red eyes and normal wings.\n\nNext, a female from this F1 generation is selected and crossed with a male fly that has purple eyes and vestigial wings. This is a \"test cross\". The offspring from this test cross (the F2 generation) are collected and categorized, yielding the following counts:\n\n- Red eyes, normal wings: 882\n- Purple eyes, vestigial wings: 891\n- Red eyes, vestigial wings: 161\n- Purple eyes, normal wings: 166\n\nBased on these results, calculate the recombination frequency between the genes for eye color and wing shape. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal of this problem is to calculate the recombination frequency between the genes for eye color ($pr$) and wing shape ($vg$). This frequency is calculated as the proportion of recombinant offspring out of the total number of offspring.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the genotypes of the flies involved in the crosses.\nThe parental (P) generation cross is between a pure-breeding fly with red eyes and normal wings and a pure-breeding fly with purple eyes and vestigial wings.\nThe genotype of the red-eyed, normal-winged parent is $pr^+/pr^+ vg^+/vg^+$.\nThe genotype of the purple-eyed, vestigial-winged parent is $pr/pr vg/vg$.\n\nCrossing these two parents produces the F1 generation. All F1 offspring will be heterozygous for both genes, with the genotype $pr^+/pr vg^+/vg$. Since $pr^+$ and $vg^+$ are dominant, all F1 flies exhibit the wild-type phenotype of red eyes and normal wings, as stated in the problem. The arrangement of alleles on the chromosomes of the F1 female is such that one chromosome carries $pr^+ vg^+$, and the homologous chromosome carries $pr vg$.\n\nNext, a test cross is performed by crossing an F1 female ($pr^+/pr vg^+/vg$) with a male that has purple eyes and vestigial wings. This male is homozygous recessive for both traits, with a genotype of $pr/pr vg/vg$.\n\nThe purpose of the test cross is that the phenotype of the offspring directly reveals the genetic makeup of the gametes produced by the heterozygous F1 parent. The homozygous recessive male only produces one type of gamete: $pr vg$.\n\nThe gametes produced by the F1 female can be either parental (non-recombinant) or recombinant.\nParental gametes have the same combination of alleles as the chromosomes the F1 female inherited from the P generation: $pr^+ vg^+$ and $pr vg$.\nRecombinant gametes are produced when crossing over occurs between the two genes, resulting in new combinations of alleles: $pr^+ vg$ and $pr vg^+$.\n\nNow, we can classify the F2 offspring from the test cross based on their phenotypes to determine whether they arose from parental or recombinant gametes from the F1 mother.\n\n- **Parental Phenotypes**: These result from the fertilization of an egg containing a parental gamete by the $pr vg$ sperm.\n  - Offspring with red eyes and normal wings ($pr^+/pr vg^+/vg$) came from a $pr^+ vg^+$ gamete. Count = 882.\n  - Offspring with purple eyes and vestigial wings ($pr/pr vg/vg$) came from a $pr vg$ gamete. Count = 891.\n  - Total number of parental offspring = $882 + 891 = 1773$.\n\n- **Recombinant Phenotypes**: These result from the fertilization of an egg containing a recombinant gamete by the $pr vg$ sperm.\n  - Offspring with red eyes and vestigial wings ($pr^+/pr vg/vg$) came from a $pr^+ vg$ gamete. Count = 161.\n  - Offspring with purple eyes and normal wings ($pr/pr vg^+/vg$) came from a $pr vg^+$ gamete. Count = 166.\n  - Total number of recombinant offspring = $161 + 166 = 327$.\n\nThe recombination frequency (RF) is defined as the number of recombinant offspring divided by the total number of offspring, expressed as a decimal or percentage.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of offspring:\nTotal offspring = (Parental offspring) + (Recombinant offspring)\nTotal offspring = $1773 + 327 = 2100$.\nAlternatively, Total offspring = $882 + 891 + 161 + 166 = 2100$.\n\nNow, calculate the recombination frequency:\n$$\n\\text{RF} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of recombinant offspring}}{\\text{Total number of offspring}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{RF} = \\frac{327}{2100}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{RF} = 0.15571428...\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\nThe first three significant figures are 1, 5, and 5.
