A colorless precursor molecule is first converted into a colorless intermediate by the action of Enzyme C. This intermediate is then converted into the final purple pigment by Enzyme P. The production of a functional Enzyme C is determined by a dominant allele, $C$, at one genetic locus, while the recessive allele, $c$, results in a non-functional enzyme. Similarly, the production of a functional Enzyme P is determined by a dominant allele, $P$, at a second, independently assorting genetic locus, while the recessive allele, $p$, results in a non-functional enzyme. Any disruption in this pathway results in white flowers.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where a true-breeding white-flowered plant from one pure line is crossed with a true-breeding white-flowered plant from a different pure line. All of the resulting F1 generation plants have purple flowers.

Because the pigment pathway is serial (precursor $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme C}}$ intermediate $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme P}}$ pigment), a functional enzyme is required at both steps to obtain purple flowers. Thus:\n- Purple phenotype occurs only for genotypes with at least one dominant allele at each locus, i.e., $C\\_P\\_$.\n- Any genotype with $cc$ (no Enzyme C) or with $pp$ (no Enzyme P) results in a pathway block and hence white flowers.\n\nThe observation that crossing two different true-breeding white lines yields all-purple F1 indicates complementation: one line is homozygous recessive at $C$ but not $P$, and the other is homozygous recessive at $P$ but not $C$.

This practice delves into polygenic inheritance, a model where multiple genes contribute additively to a single quantitative phenotype. You will calculate how shuffling alleles during meiosis can produce offspring with phenotypes that lie outside the range of their parents, a key source of novel variation for selection to act upon [@problem_id:1935470].", "problem": "Consider a simplified genetic model for a quantitative trait, such as height, in a hypothetical organism. The organism's height is determined by a baseline height of 150 cm, plus an additional height contribution from a set of four unlinked gene loci: A, B, C, and D. Each locus has two possible alleles: an additive allele (denoted with a subscript '1', e.g., $A_1$) that contributes 5 cm to the final height, and a non-additive allele (denoted with a subscript '0', e.g., $A_0$) that contributes 0 cm to the final height. The effects of the additive alleles are cumulative, and there are no dominance effects.\n\nTwo parent organisms both exhibit a phenotype of exactly 170 cm in height. They produce an offspring that has a height of 185 cm.\n\nAssuming no new mutations occurred, which of the following statements provides the most accurate genetic explanation for how the parents could produce an offspring with this substantially different phenotype?\n\nA. The parents are likely heterozygous at multiple loci controlling height. By chance, during meiosis, the offspring inherited a combination of gametes that resulted in a greater total number of additive alleles than was present in either parent's diploid genome.\n\nB. Height is a trait showing blending inheritance. Therefore, it is impossible for the offspring to be this tall, and the measurement must be an error, as the offspring's height must lie between the parental heights.\n\nC. The additive alleles ($A_1, B_1$, etc.) are recessive to the non-additive alleles. Both parents were heterozygous carriers, and the offspring inherited the correct combination of recessive alleles to express the tall phenotype.\n\nD. Environmental factors must be responsible. The offspring was raised in a significantly better environment than its parents, which caused the over-expression of its height genes, leading to the taller phenotype.\n\nE. The parents' genotypes were homozygous for different sets of alleles that averaged out to the same height. The offspring's height resulted from combining these different homozygous alleles. For example, one parent was $A_1A_1B_1B_1C_0C_0D_0D_0$ and the other was $A_0A_0B_0B_0C_1C_1D_1D_1$.", "solution": "Let $N_{1}$ denote the total number of additive alleles (the alleles with subscript $1$) across the four unlinked loci in a diploid organism.

This final problem challenges you to connect phenotypic fitness differences to their population-level consequences by calculating the equilibrium frequency of an allele under balancing selection. This practice demonstrates mathematically how opposing selective pressures on different genotypes can actively maintain genetic diversity within a population [@problem_id:1935492].", "problem": "In a particular species of vole inhabiting a high-altitude plateau, a single gene, the Vaso-constrictive Response (VCR) locus, controls the physiological response to low oxygen levels. The allele 'R' is dominant and codes for a standard response. A recessive allele, 'r', codes for a modified response. Genetic analysis of the population reveals the following selective effects:\n\n1.  Individuals with the homozygous dominant genotype ('RR') have a standard vaso-constrictive response that is not ideally suited for the chronic hypoxia of their environment. As a result, their probability of surviving to reproductive age is 20% lower than that of the genotype with the highest survival rate.\n2.  Individuals with the heterozygous genotype ('Rr') exhibit a blended response that is optimal for the high-altitude conditions, giving them the highest survival rate in the population.\n3.  The homozygous recessive genotype ('rr') results in a severe over-response, leading to fatal pulmonary edema before the individual reaches sexual maturity. Consequently, their survival rate to reproductive age is zero.\n\nAssuming this population is at a stable genetic equilibrium maintained by these opposing selective pressures, calculate the frequency of the recessive allele 'r'. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "This problem describes a case of balancing selection, specifically heterozygote advantage or overdominance, where the heterozygous genotype has a higher fitness than either homozygous genotype. We need to find the equilibrium frequency of the recessive allele, 'r'.\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of the dominant allele 'R' and $q$ be the frequency of the recessive allele 'r'. By definition, in a population with two alleles at a locus, $p + q = 1$.\n\nFirst, we must assign relative fitness values ($w$) to each of the three genotypes. Relative fitness is a measure of the survival and reproductive success of one genotype compared to others. We normalize the fitness values by assigning a value of 1 to the most fit genotype.\nBased on the problem statement:\n- The heterozygous genotype 'Rr' has the highest survival rate, so we assign it a relative fitness of $w_{Rr} = 1$.\n- The homozygous dominant genotype 'RR' has a survival rate 20% lower than the fittest genotype. This means its relative fitness is $w_{RR} = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n- The homozygous recessive genotype 'rr' is lethal, meaning its survival rate is zero. Its relative fitness is $w_{rr} = 0$.\n\nNext, we define the selection coefficients ($s$) for the homozygous genotypes. The selection coefficient measures the reduction in fitness of a genotype relative to the most fit genotype.\n- The selection coefficient against 'RR' is $s_1$, where $w_{RR} = 1 - s_1$. Therefore, $s_1 = 1 - w_{RR} = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n- The selection coefficient against 'rr' is $s_2$, where $w_{rr} = 1 - s_2$. Therefore, $s_2 = 1 - w_{rr} = 1 - 0 = 1.0$.\n\nAt equilibrium, the frequency of the alleles does not change from one generation to the next. The equilibrium frequency of the recessive allele, $\\hat{q}$, in a system with heterozygote advantage is given by the formula:\n$$ \\hat{q} = \\frac{s_1}{s_1 + s_2} $$\nThis formula arises from setting the change in allele frequency per generation ($\\Delta q$) to zero. The full derivation for $\\Delta q = 0$ is as follows:\nThe change in the frequency of allele 'r' in one generation is given by:\n$$ \\Delta q = \\frac{pq[p(w_{Rr} - w_{RR}) + q(w_{rr} - w_{Rr})]}{\\bar{w}} $$\nwhere $\\bar{w}$ is the mean fitness of the population ($\\bar{w} = p^2 w_{RR} + 2pq w_{Rr} + q^2 w_{rr}$).\nAt equilibrium, $\\Delta q = 0$. For this to be true (assuming $p, q \\neq 0$), the numerator's bracketed term must be zero:\n$$ p(w_{Rr} - w_{RR}) + q(w_{rr} - w_{Rr}) = 0 $$\nSubstituting the relative fitness values:\n$$ p(1 - 0.80) + q(0 - 1) = 0 $$\n$$ 0.20p - q = 0 $$\n$$ 0.20p = q $$\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1. $q = 0.20p$\n2. $p + q = 1$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$$ p + (0.20p) = 1 $$\n$$ 1.20p = 1 $$\n$$ p = \\frac{1}{1.20} $$\nNow solve for $q$, which is the equilibrium frequency we are looking for:\n$$ \\hat{q} = 1 - p = 1 - \\frac{1}{1.20} = \\frac{1.20 - 1}{1.20} = \\frac{0.20}{1.20} $$\nThis confirms our initial formula, $\\hat{q} = \\frac{s_1}{s_1 + s_2} = \\frac{0.20}{0.20 + 1.0} = \\frac{0.20}{1.20}$.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value for $\\hat{q}$:\n$$ \\hat{q} = \\frac{0.20}{1.20} = \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6} $$\nAs a decimal, this is:\n$$ \\hat{q} = 0.16666... $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\hat{q} \\approx 0.167 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.167}$$", "id": "1935492"}]}
