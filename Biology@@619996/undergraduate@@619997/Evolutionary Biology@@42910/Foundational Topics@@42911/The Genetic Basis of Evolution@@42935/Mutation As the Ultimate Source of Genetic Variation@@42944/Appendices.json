While the mutation rate for a single nucleotide is incredibly low, populations are often vast. This practice bridges the gap between the microscopic scale of a single mutation and the macroscopic reality of a population's gene pool. By calculating the total number of new mutations expected to arise in a specific gene across an entire population each generation, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for how large populations serve as relentless engines for generating the raw material upon which selection can act [@problem_id:1949414].", "problem": "A team of astrobiologists has discovered a species of single-celled, haploid archaea, which they have named *Thermofilum rapidus*, thriving near a hydrothermal vent on a distant moon.

Through genomic sequencing, the base-pair mutation rate, $\\mu_{bp}$, is determined to be $5.1 \\times 10^{-10}$ mutations per base pair, per generation.

Many mutations are selectively neutral, meaning they offer no immediate advantage or disadvantage. This exercise explores the fate of such an allele, which is determined purely by the lottery of random chance, a process known as genetic drift. You will calculate the initial frequency of a single new mutation in a diploid population and discover a fundamental principle of population genetics: its ultimate probability of becoming fixed in the population is precisely equal to that small starting frequency [@problem_id:1949390].", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is maintaining a closed, captive population of a species of diploid guppy. The population size has been stable for many generations at $N = 120$ individuals. Through genetic sequencing, the researchers identify a spontaneous mutation that has just occurred in a single allele of one of the guppies. Subsequent analysis confirms that this new allele is selectively neutral, meaning it confers no survival or reproductive advantage or disadvantage to the individuals that carry it. All other individuals in the population are homozygous for the original, wild-type allele at this locus.\n\nCalculate the initial frequency of this new mutant allele in the entire population's gene pool, and determine its ultimate probability of fixation.

This concept, known as epistasis, is explored in this practice, moving beyond simplified models where a mutation is always beneficial or always deleterious. This exercise uses a hypothetical two-locus system to demonstrate how a mutation's effect on fitness—and thus its selective coefficient, $s$—can change dramatically based on the allele present at a different gene [@problem_id:1949386]. This highlights the critical principle that natural selection acts on the integrated phenotype of the entire organism, not on isolated genes.", "problem": "In a large, haploid microbial population, organismal fitness is determined by the alleles at two loci, Locus 1 and Locus 2. At Locus 1, alleles `a` and `A` are possible. At Locus 2, alleles `b` and `B` are possible. The population is initially composed entirely of individuals with the `aB` genotype, which is considered the wild-type. The fitness of this wild-type genotype is defined as $W_{aB} = 1.0$.\n\nThe fitness of any other genotype is determined by a simple additive model with an interaction term. The change in fitness due to a new allele is given by a selection coefficient, $s$, relative to the wild-type allele at that locus. The presence of allele `A` (instead of `a`) contributes a term $s_A$. The presence of allele `b` (instead of `B`) contributes a term $s_b$. Additionally, a specific epistatic interaction occurs when alleles `A` and `b` are present together, adding a term $\\epsilon_{Ab}$ to the fitness.\n\nThe fitness, $W$, of any genotype is calculated as:\n$W = W_{aB} + (\\text{sum of individual allele effects}) + (\\text{epistatic effect, if applicable})$\n\nYou are given the following parameters:\n- The fitness effect of allele `A`: $s_A = 0.12$\n- The fitness effect of allele `b`: $s_b = -0.08$\n- The epistatic interaction effect between `A` and `b`: $\\epsilon_{Ab} = -0.25$\n\nA mutation from `a` to `A` can occur in this population. The effect of this mutation on fitness depends on the genetic background in which it arises. Calculate the selection coefficient for this `a` to `A` mutation in two different scenarios:\n1. The mutation occurs in an individual with the wild-type genetic background (allele `B` at Locus 2).\n2. The mutation occurs in an individual from a sub-population that has already fixed a mutation at Locus 2 (allele `b`).\n\nThe selection coefficient, $s_{mut}$, for a new mutation is defined as $s_{mut} = \\frac{W_{mutant} - W_{ancestor}}{W_{ancestor}}$.\n\nProvide your two calculated selection coefficients, for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively, as a row matrix.
