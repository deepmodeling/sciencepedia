They have determined that purple flowers (P) are dominant over white flowers (p), and a smooth stem surface (S) is dominant over a thorny stem surface (s). The genes for these two traits are located on different chromosomes and thus assort independently.\n\nA researcher has a plant that exhibits both dominant phenotypes: purple flowers and a smooth stem. To determine the exact genotype of this plant, they perform a test cross with another plant that has white flowers and a thorny stem. The cross results in 1000 offspring with the following phenotypic distribution:\n\n- 254 plants with purple flowers and smooth stems\n- 248 plants with purple flowers and thorny stems\n- 251 plants with white flowers and smooth stems\n- 247 plants with white flowers and thorny stems\n\nBased on this data, what is the genotype of the parent plant that had purple flowers and a smooth stem?\n\nA.

The two genes assort independently (on different chromosomes). A test cross uses a homozygous recessive partner, here $ppss$, so the phenotypes of the offspring directly reflect the gametes produced by the unknown parent.\n\nLet the unknown parent be one of the listed genotypes and cross it with $ppss$:\n\n1) If the parent is $PPSS$, its only gamete is $PS$, and with $ps$ from $ppss$ all offspring are $PpSs$ (all purple, smooth). This contradicts the presence of all four phenotypic classes observed.\n\n2) If the parent is $PPSs$, its gametes are $PS$ and $Ps$ in equal frequency. With $ps$, offspring are $PpSs$ (purple, smooth) and $Ppss$ (purple, thorny) in a $1:1$ ratio. No white-flowered offspring would occur, contradicting the data.\n\n3) If the parent is $PpSS$, its gametes are $PS$ and $pS$ in equal frequency. With $ps$, offspring are $PpSs$ (purple, smooth) and $ppSs$ (white, smooth) in a $1:1$ ratio. No thorny-stem offspring would occur, contradicting the data.\n\n4) If the parent is $ppss$, then all offspring with $ppss$ would be white and thorny, which contradicts both the parent’s phenotype and the observed distribution.\n\n5) If the parent is $PpSs$, its gametes are $PS$, $Ps$, $pS$, and $ps$ in equal frequency by independent assortment. Crossing with $ppss$ (gamete $ps$) yields the four genotypes $PpSs$, $Ppss$, $ppSs$, and $ppss$ in the ratio $1:1:1:1$, corresponding to the four phenotypes purple-smooth, purple-thorny, white-smooth, and white-thorny, each with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. The observed counts (approximately equal across the four classes) are consistent with this $1:1:1:1$ expectation.\n\nTherefore, the unknown parent must be heterozygous at both loci, $PpSs$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1513215"}, {"introduction": "The principles of Mendelian genetics are not just for Punnett squares; they are vital tools in fields like genetic counseling. When a child is born with multiple genetic conditions, understanding independent assortment is key to explaining how these traits were inherited from phenotypically normal parents.

They have a child who has been diagnosed with two distinct genetic conditions: Acular Dyschromia (AD), a recessive disorder affecting vision, and Neurofilament Aggregation Syndrome (NAS), a recessive neurological disorder. Genetic analysis reveals that the genes responsible for AD and NAS are located on different, non-homologous chromosomes.\n\nLet the allele for normal vision be denoted by $A$ and the recessive allele causing AD by $a$. Similarly, let the allele for normal neurological function be $N$ and the recessive allele causing NAS by $n$.\n\nBased on this information, identify the genotypes of the two parents from the options below.\n\nA.

Let the normal alleles be $A$ and $N$, and the recessive disease alleles be $a$ and $n$. The child is affected with both diseases, so the child’s genotype must be $aa$ for AD and $nn$ for NAS; overall child genotype is $aann$.\n\nFor an autosomal recessive trait, an affected child must inherit one recessive allele from each parent. Thus:\n- To produce a child with $aa$, each parent must carry at least one $a$ allele. Since both parents are phenotypically normal at the $A$ locus, each must be $Aa$.\n- To produce a child with $nn$, each parent must carry at least one $n$ allele. Since both parents are phenotypically normal at the $N$ locus, each must be $Nn$.\n\nTherefore, each parent must be $AaNn$.\n\nThis is consistent with independent assortment (genes on different chromosomes). At the $A$ locus, $Aa \\times Aa$ yields the genotype ratio\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4}AA : \\frac{1}{2}Aa : \\frac{1}{4}aa.\n$$\nAt the $N$ locus, $Nn \\times Nn$ yields\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4}NN : \\frac{1}{2}Nn : \\frac{1}{4}nn.\n$$\nBy independence, the probability of a child being $aann$ is\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{16},\n$$\nwhich is nonzero and consistent with the observed affected child.\n\nChecking the options:\n- A: One parent $AANN$ and the other $AaNn$.

The $AANn$ parent cannot pass $a$ (only $A$), and the $AaNN$ parent cannot pass $n$ (only $N$); $aa$ and $nn$ cannot occur; impossible.\n- C: Both parents $AaNn$. As shown, this can produce an $aann$ child with nonzero probability; consistent.\n- D: One parent $aann$ and the other $AaNn$. The $aann$ parent is affected with both disorders, contradicting the statement that both parents are phenotypically normal; impossible.\n- E: Both parents $AANn$.
