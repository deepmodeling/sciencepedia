{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Island archipelagos, like the fictitious Meridian Archipelago described here, serve as exceptional natural laboratories for observing evolutionary processes in action. The sequential colonization of new habitats, often referred to as a \"stepping-stone\" model, creates a series of founder events where each new population is established by a small number of individuals from the previous one. This exercise asks you to predict the outcome of this process on genetic diversity, measured by heterozygosity ($H$).\n\nThis practice will strengthen your understanding of how demographic history, shaped by geography, leaves a clear and predictable signature in the genetic makeup of populations, a foundational concept linking population genetics and biogeography. [@problem_id:1922871]", "problem": "The Meridian Archipelago is a linear chain of four oceanic islands—Arrakis, Boros, Caladan, and Draconis—formed sequentially by a stationary volcanic hotspot under a moving tectonic plate. The islands are arranged geographically from west to east: Arrakis is the westernmost, followed by Boros, then Caladan, and finally Draconis is the easternmost. Geological dating confirms that Arrakis is the oldest island, and the islands become progressively younger moving eastward, with Draconis being the youngest.\n\nA species of flight-capable bird, the Crimson Finch, is found on all four islands. Ecological studies indicate that this species is not a strong long-distance flier and primarily colonizes new territory by moving to the nearest adjacent island. This type of dispersal is known as a \"stepping-stone\" model, meaning that new islands are colonized sequentially from the next-oldest island.\n\nA team of evolutionary biologists collected genetic samples from large, representative populations of the Crimson Finch on each of the four islands. They analyzed genetic variation by calculating the average heterozygosity ($H$) across a set of 50 neutral genetic markers. Heterozygosity is a common measure of genetic diversity within a population, with higher values indicating greater diversity. The calculated average heterozygosity values for the four island populations were found to be 0.25, 0.48, 0.61, and 0.79.\n\nBased on the principles of island biogeography and population genetics, specifically the stepping-stone colonization model, which of the following options correctly assigns the observed heterozygosity values to the corresponding island populations?\n\nA. Arrakis: 0.79; Boros: 0.61; Caladan: 0.48; Draconis: 0.25\n\nB. Arrakis: 0.25; Boros: 0.48; Caladan: 0.61; Draconis: 0.79\n\nC. Arrakis: 0.61; Boros: 0.79; Caladan: 0.25; Draconis: 0.48\n\nD.

Arrakis: 0.48; Boros: 0.61; Caladan: 0.79; Draconis: 0.25", "solution": "The archipelago formed sequentially over a stationary hotspot as the plate moved west to east, so Arrakis is the oldest island and Draconis the youngest. The Crimson Finch disperses via a stepping-stone process, primarily colonizing the nearest adjacent island. Therefore the colonization pathway is Arrakis $\\rightarrow$ Boros $\\rightarrow$ Caladan $\\rightarrow$ Draconis.\n\nIn a stepping-stone colonization model with limited dispersal, each new island is founded by a subset of individuals from the previous island. This produces a founder effect and subsequent genetic drift in small founder populations, which reduce heterozygosity relative to the source. A standard population genetics result for drift is that expected heterozygosity after one generation in a population of effective size $N_{e}$ is reduced by a factor $(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_{e}})$, so across $g$ generations the heterozygosity scales as $H_{t+g} \\approx H_{t}\\prod_{j=1}^{g}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_{e,j}}\\right)$ in the absence of mutation and migration. Across serial founder events along islands, this yields a monotonic decline in heterozygosity with distance from the original source:\n$$\nH_{\\text{Arrakis}} > H_{\\text{Boros}} > H_{\\text{Caladan}} > H_{\\text{Draconis}},\n$$\ngiven minimal back-migration and no long-distance jumps, which is consistent with the stated weak long-distance flight ability.\n\nThe observed heterozygosity values are $0.25$, $0.48$, $0.61$, and $0.79$. To satisfy the strict ordering above, we assign the highest value to the oldest island and decrease eastward:\n$$\nH_{\\text{Arrakis}} = 0.79,\\quad H_{\\text{Boros}} = 0.61,\\quad H_{\\text{Caladan}} = 0.48,\\quad H_{\\text{Draconis}} = 0.25.\n$$\nThis assignment corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1922871"}, {"introduction": "Explaining the presence of closely related species in geographically distant locations is a central puzzle in biogeography. The two leading hypotheses are ancient vicariance, where a once-continuous population is fragmented by geological events like continental drift, and long-distance dispersal, where individuals cross a pre-existing barrier. This thought experiment challenges you to determine which specific genetic patterns would serve as a \"smoking gun\" for an ancient vicariance event that occurred tens of millions of years ago.\n\nBy working through this problem, you will learn to translate high-level evolutionary hypotheses into concrete, testable predictions based on phylogenetic trees and molecular clock dating. This skill is fundamental to the field of phylogeography, which reconstructs the historical processes that have shaped the geographic distribution of life. [@problem_id:1922899]", "problem": "A biologist is studying the distribution of a rare moss species, *Cryotolerans antarcticus*, which is found exclusively on three geographically isolated locations: the Kerguelen Islands, Heard Island, and a specific coastal region of the Antarctic Peninsula. Two primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain this disjunct distribution.\n\n**Hypothesis 1 (Ancient Vicariance):** The moss populated a more contiguous landmass that existed during the Eocene epoch. The fragmentation of this landmass due to plate tectonics and subsequent geological events, estimated to have concluded around 40 million years ago (Ma), isolated the ancestral population into the three distinct groups seen today.\n\n**Hypothesis 2 (Recent Long-Distance Dispersal):** The moss species originated in one of the locations and recently colonized the other two. This dispersal is hypothesized to have occurred after the Last Glacial Maximum, within the last 15,000 years, with spores carried by strong circumpolar winds or migratory sea birds.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, the biologist sequences a specific non-coding region of the chloroplast DNA from multiple individuals from all three populations. A molecular clock analysis is then performed. Which of the following hypothetical sets of findings would provide the most compelling and unambiguous evidence in support of the ancient vicariance hypothesis?\n\nA. The populations from each of the three locations form a distinct, reciprocally monophyletic clade in the phylogenetic tree. Molecular clock dating estimates the divergence time between these three clades to be approximately 38 Ma. Genetic diversity within each island population is relatively high.\n\nB. The same few chloroplast DNA haplotypes are found to be widely shared among individuals from all three locations. A statistical analysis of population structure reveals negligible genetic differentiation ($F_{\\text{ST}} \\approx 0$). The estimated time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (tMRCA) for all sampled individuals is approximately 12,000 years.\n\nC. The phylogenetic tree shows that individuals from the Kerguelen Islands and Heard Island form a single, intermixed clade with a time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (tMRCA) of 50,000 years. This island clade is, in turn, sister to a distinct clade containing all individuals from the Antarctic Peninsula, with a divergence date of approximately 2 Ma.\n\nD. Genetic diversity is extremely high within each of the three populations, but the phylogenetic relationships among them are unresolved. The resulting tree is a \"star phylogeny\" where all haplotypes appear to diverge from a central point simultaneously. The 95% confidence interval for the time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (tMRCA) of the species is very large, ranging from 100,000 years to 45 Ma.\n\nE. All individuals sampled from all three locations are genetically identical, sharing a single chloroplast DNA haplotype. A search in a global genetic database reveals that this exact haplotype is also found in a related moss species from southern South America, from which it is estimated to have diverged 80 Ma.", "solution": "To decide which findings most strongly support ancient vicariance, first translate each hypothesis into clear, testable genetic predictions.\n\nUnder ancient vicariance, long-term isolation since an Eocene fragmentation event implies: (i) reciprocal monophyly of each regional population, because drift and mutation over tens of millions of years would sort ancestral polymorphism, (ii) deep divergence times among regional clades that match the timing of isolation (on the order of tens of millions of years, around the Eocene, approximately 40 Ma), (iii) high genetic differentiation among regions (high $F_{ST}$), and (iv) substantial within-population diversity accumulated over long periods.\n\nUnder recent long-distance dispersal after the Last Glacial Maximum, predictions are the opposite: (i) widespread sharing or intermixture of haplotypes among regions, (ii) shallow coalescent times on the order of thousands of years, (iii) very low among-population structure (low $F_{ST}$), and (iv) possibly a star-like genealogy indicative of recent expansion.\n\nEvaluate each option against these predictions.\n\nOption A reports three reciprocally monophyletic clades corresponding to the three regions, with molecular-clock divergence among them estimated at approximately 38 Ma and relatively high within-population diversity. This directly matches vicariance predictions: the topology (reciprocal monophyly), the timescale (close to the Eocene fragmentation), and the within-population diversity pattern all align with long isolation. This is compelling and unambiguous support for ancient vicariance.\n\nOption B shows the same haplotypes shared across all regions, $F_{ST} \\approx 0$, and a time to the most recent common ancestor of about 12,000 years. These findings align with recent, postglacial dispersal and contradict ancient vicariance.\n\nOption C shows Kerguelen and Heard intermixed with a tMRCA of 50,000 years, and this island clade sister to the Antarctic Peninsula with a divergence of about 2 Ma. The lack of reciprocal monophyly among all three regions and divergence times in the Pleistocene to early Pleistocene are far too recent for an Eocene vicariance scenario; this suggests more recent dispersal or secondary contact, not ancient vicariance.\n\nOption D presents a star phylogeny with an extremely broad confidence interval on tMRCA spanning from 100,000 years to 45 Ma. The unresolved topology and very wide dating interval are not unambiguous; such results cannot specifically support ancient vicariance.\n\nOption E reports no variation across the species (a single haplotype shared among all individuals) and presence of the same haplotype in a related South American moss with an interspecific divergence of 80 Ma. The absence of intraspecific divergence across regions contradicts expectations under ancient vicariance; the interspecific divergence time is irrelevant to within-species population history and offers no support for Eocene fragmentation of the focal species.\n\nTherefore, only Option A provides the most compelling and unambiguous evidence for ancient vicariance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1922899"}, {"introduction": "The advent of whole-genome sequencing has revolutionized our ability to study evolution, allowing us to disentangle the complex interplay of different evolutionary forces. This problem presents a realistic scenario where you must interpret genomic data to assess the ecological connectivity between two coral populations. You are given two key pieces of information: the average genetic differentiation across the entire genome, and the differentiation at a single gene known to be under strong natural selection.\n\nThis advanced exercise demonstrates how modern population genomics can reveal nuanced evolutionary stories. By comparing the genome-wide background differentiation ($F_{ST}$) with outlier loci under selection, we can simultaneously test for ongoing gene flow and the power of local adaptation, providing deep insights into the dynamics that shape biodiversity. [@problem_id:1922867]", "problem": "Two populations of a reef-building coral species, designated `Pop-East` and `Pop-West`, are found on opposite sides of a deep oceanic trench, which has historically been considered a significant barrier to larval dispersal. `Pop-East` inhabits a warmer, more thermally variable environment than `Pop-West`. Oceanographic models suggest that a transient, seasonal oceanic eddy system may form across the trench. A research team aims to determine if this eddy system functions as a dispersal bridge, facilitating gene flow, or if the trench remains a persistent barrier to dispersal.\n\nTo investigate this, the team collected tissue samples from both populations and performed whole-genome sequencing. From this data, they calculated two key metrics based on the Fixation index ($F_{ST}$), a measure of population differentiation where values near 0 indicate high gene flow and values near 1 indicate complete isolation.\n\nThe calculated metrics are:\n1.  The genome-wide average $F_{ST}$ between `Pop-East` and `Pop-West`, computed across thousands of neutrally evolving genetic loci, is $0.07$.\n2.  The locus-specific $F_{ST}$ for a particular heat-shock protein gene, known to be under strong positive selection for thermal tolerance in the warmer `Pop-East` environment, is $0.82$.\n\nBased on a rigorous interpretation of these two $F_{ST}$ values, which of the following conclusions provides the most accurate and parsimonious explanation for the role of the eddy system and the evolutionary dynamics between the two populations?\n\nA. The high $F_{ST}$ value at the heat-shock protein gene ($0.82$) is the most informative metric, proving that the two populations are almost completely isolated and the eddy system is not a functional dispersal bridge.\n\nB. The low genome-wide average $F_{ST}$ value ($0.07$) indicates the populations are in the early stages of allopatric speciation, and the eddy system has only recently ceased to function as a bridge.\n\nC. The two $F_{ST}$ values are irreconcilably contradictory, suggesting a major flaw in the experimental design or data analysis, and therefore no conclusion can be drawn.\n\nD. The eddy system acts as a functional dispersal bridge, facilitating ongoing gene flow between the two populations, but strong divergent selection at the heat-shock protein locus maintains high genetic differentiation for that specific gene.\n\nE. The eddy system facilitates such extensive gene flow that the two populations are functionally a single panmictic population, and the high $F_{ST}$ at the heat-shock locus is a statistical artifact with no biological meaning.", "solution": "We begin with the definition and interpretation of the fixation index. By definition, $F_{ST}$ measures genetic differentiation among populations, with $F_{ST} \\approx 0$ indicating very high gene flow and $F_{ST} \\approx 1$ indicating near-complete isolation. Under a standard island model at neutral loci, the expected genome-wide $F_{ST}$ satisfies\n$$\nF_{ST} \\approx \\frac{1}{4N_{e}m + 1},\n$$\nwhere $N_{e}$ is the effective population size and $m$ is the per-generation migration rate. Therefore, a small genome-wide average $F_{ST}$ implies $4N_{e}m \\gg 1$, i.e., ongoing, appreciable gene flow.\n\nApply this to the genome-wide average $F_{ST} = 0.07$ computed across thousands of neutrally evolving loci. Because this is small, the neutral expectation implies substantial effective gene flow between the two populations. Given the physical context, the most parsimonious mechanism for such connectivity is that the seasonal eddy system acts as a dispersal bridge across the trench. If the trench were a persistent, strict barrier with negligible migration, the genome-wide neutral $F_{ST}$ would be much larger.\n\nNext, consider the locus-specific $F_{ST} = 0.82$ at a heat-shock protein gene that is under strong positive selection for thermal tolerance in the warmer, more variable environment of Pop-East. In a two-deme system experiencing divergent selection, selection can counteract gene flow at specific loci. A standard selection–migration balance argument states that, when a locally adapted allele experiences selection coefficient $s$ favoring different alleles in the two environments while the baseline migration rate is $m$, high differentiation at that locus is maintained provided selection dominates migration, e.g., when $s \\gtrsim m$. Under such conditions, locus-specific differentiation can be very high even when the genome-wide neutral background shows low differentiation. This leads to the well-known pattern of “genomic islands of divergence,” where outlier loci under divergent selection exhibit high $F_{ST}$ amidst a low-neutral-background $F_{ST}$.\n\nTherefore, the two observations—low genome-wide $F_{ST}$ and high $F_{ST}$ at a heat-shock locus known to be under selection—are fully consistent and mutually reinforcing: neutral loci record ongoing gene flow facilitated by the eddy bridge, while strong, environment-specific selection maintains high differentiation at the heat-shock gene.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- Option A is incorrect because it overweights a single, selected locus. High $F_{ST}$ at a locus under strong divergent selection does not imply genome-wide isolation; it is expected under selection–migration balance while gene flow persists.\n- Option B is incorrect because a low genome-wide $F_{ST}$ indicates ongoing gene flow rather than the cessation of connectivity; it does not diagnose early-stage allopatry.\n- Option C is incorrect because there is no contradiction: the pattern is the expected signature of local adaptation with gene flow.\n- Option D is correct: the eddy system functions as a dispersal bridge enabling gene flow, while strong divergent selection at the heat-shock locus maintains high differentiation at that gene.\n- Option E is incorrect because the populations are not effectively panmictic if a locus shows extreme differentiation aligned with a known selective pressure; calling it a statistical artifact is unwarranted given the biological context and whole-genome data.\n\nThus, the most accurate and parsimonious explanation is that gene flow occurs via the eddy system, but strong divergent selection maintains high $F_{ST}$ at the heat-shock protein gene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1922867"}]}
