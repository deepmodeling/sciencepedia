Genetic analysis reveals that both species possess a highly similar gene coding for a heat-shock protein.

This region is chosen because it is believed to be evolving neutrally.\n\nThe aligned sequences of this non-coding region are 1500 base pairs (bp) in length. Upon comparison, the researchers identify 18 nucleotide differences between the two species.

The growth rate is constrained by the speed of protein synthesis. One of the most highly expressed genes in yeast encodes the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1).\n\nConsider two alleles of the *PGK1* gene in this population. The wild-type allele, `PGK1-A`, is the most common. A second allele, `PGK1-B`, differs by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that results in a synonymous (\"silent\") mutation.
