This practice focuses on translating a DNA sequence into its corresponding mRNA codon and tRNA anticodon, reinforcing the crucial rules of base pairing and strand directionality.

The process of transcription generates an mRNA molecule from a DNA template. Subsequently, during translation, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each with a specific three-nucleotide anticodon, recognize corresponding codons on the mRNA to assemble a polypeptide chain.\n\nConsider the segment of a gene that codes for the amino acid methionine, which typically initiates protein synthesis. The nucleotide sequence on the **template strand** of the DNA for this amino acid is given as 3'-TAC-5'.\n\nWhich of the following choices correctly identifies the resulting mRNA codon and the tRNA anticodon that pairs with it? All sequences must have their 5' and 3' ends explicitly labeled.\n\nA. mRNA codon: 5'-AUG-3', tRNA anticodon: 3'-UAC-5'\n\nB. mRNA codon: 5'-AUG-3', tRNA anticodon: 5'-UAC-3'\n\nC. mRNA codon: 3'-UAC-5', tRNA anticodon: 5'-AUG-3'\n\nD. mRNA codon: 5'-ATG-3', tRNA anticodon: 3'-UAC-5'\n\nE. mRNA codon: 5'-AUG-3', tRNA anticodon: 3'-TAC-5'", "solution": "We use the central dogma directionality and base-pairing rules for transcription and translation.\n\n1) Transcription uses the DNA template strand, which is read by RNA polymerase in the 3' to 5' direction to synthesize mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction. Base-pairing rules are: template DNA A pairs with RNA U, template DNA T pairs with RNA A, template DNA G pairs with RNA C, and template DNA C pairs with RNA G.\n\n2) The given template strand segment is 3'-TAC-5'. Writing the complementary mRNA antiparallel to it gives 5'-AUG-3'. This is the mRNA codon for methionine.\n\n3) During translation, the tRNA anticodon pairs with the mRNA codon antiparallel and with complementary bases. The complement of 5'-AUG-3' is 3'-UAC-5'. Therefore, the tRNA anticodon is 3'-UAC-5'.\n\n4) Checking the options:\n- A gives mRNA 5'-AUG-3' and tRNA 3'-UAC-5', which matches the correct antiparallel complementarity.\n- B has the anticodon written 5' to 3' as UAC, which would not pair antiparallel as written.\n- C has the mRNA codon in the wrong orientation and identity.\n- D uses T instead of U in mRNA, which is incorrect.\n- E uses T in the tRNA anticodon, which is incorrect for RNA.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1975604"}, {"introduction": "The genetic code's integrity is vital, but mutations can alter the information it carries. This exercise [@problem_id:1975574] explores the dramatic difference in outcome between a single nucleotide substitution and a single nucleotide insertion. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario, you will gain insight into the critical concept of the 'reading frame' and understand why frameshift mutations are often far more destructive to protein function.", "problem": "A hypothetical marine bacterium, *Aquasalina superstes*, relies on a crucial protein called HydroOsmotin to regulate its internal ion concentration, allowing it to survive in environments with variable salinity. The gene encoding HydroOsmotin is therefore essential for the bacterium's viability.\n\nIn a controlled laboratory setting, two distinct colonies of *A. superstes* are studied.\n- In Colony Alpha, a spontaneous point mutation occurs, changing the 13th nucleotide in the HydroOsmotin gene's coding sequence from Guanine (G) to Adenine (A).\n- In a separate culture, Colony Beta, a different spontaneous mutation results in the insertion of a single Cytosine (C) nucleotide immediately after the 12th nucleotide of the same gene's coding sequence.\n\nWhen both colonies are subsequently subjected to a rapid and significant increase in the external water salinity, the bacteria in Colony Alpha are observed to survive, although their rate of reproduction is noticeably diminished. In stark contrast, the entire population of Colony Beta perishes.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental molecular explanation for why the single nucleotide insertion in Colony Beta was catastrophically lethal, while the single nucleotide substitution in Colony Alpha was not?\n\nA. The substitution in Colony Alpha resulted in a missense mutation, changing only one amino acid, which only partially impaired the protein's function. In contrast, the insertion in Colony Beta caused a frameshift mutation, altering every codon downstream and leading to a completely non-functional protein.\n\nB. Single nucleotide insertions cause severe structural damage to the chromosome, which prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the gene. Single nucleotide substitutions are too small to cause such large-scale structural damage and are ignored by the transcription machinery.\n\nC. The insertion in Colony Beta immediately created a premature stop codon at the site of the mutation, halting translation before a functional protein could be made. The substitution in Colony Alpha did not happen to create a stop-code.\n\nD. The cell's innate DNA repair mechanisms are highly effective at correcting single nucleotide substitutions, likely reverting the mutation in many of the bacteria in Colony Alpha. However, these mechanisms are incapable of detecting and repairing single nucleotide insertions.\n\nE. The insertion of an extra nucleotide scrambles the promoter sequence of the gene, preventing the initiation of transcription. A substitution within the coding region, being far from the promoter, does not have this effect.", "solution": "The fundamental principle is that translation reads mRNA in a fixed, non-overlapping triplet reading frame, established at initiation, so that nucleotides are parsed as codons in groups of three. A single-nucleotide substitution within the coding region changes at most one codon and thus can alter zero or one amino acid (silent or missense), while an insertion or deletion of a nucleotide number not divisible by three shifts the reading frame and thereby changes every codon downstream of the mutation.\n\nApply this to the two cases:\n1) In Colony Alpha, the mutation is a G to A substitution at the 13th nucleotide of the coding sequence. This changes the identity of the codon containing that nucleotide but does not alter the grouping of codons. Consequently, only one amino acid may change (missense), or the change may be synonymous due to degeneracy of the genetic code. The observation that the bacteria survive but reproduce more slowly is consistent with a partially functional HydroOsmotin due to a single amino acid change that impairs, but does not abolish, protein function.\n\n2) In Colony Beta, the mutation is the insertion of a single C immediately after the 12th nucleotide. Because codons are read in triplets, an insertion of one nucleotide shifts the reading frame beginning at nucleotide 13. Thus, every codon from that point forward is altered relative to the original frame, typically leading to the incorporation of extensive incorrect amino acid sequence and frequently introducing a premature stop codon downstream due to the new triplet combinations. The result is a truncated, misfolded, or entirely non-functional HydroOsmotin, i.e., a null or near-null allele. Given that HydroOsmotin is essential for survival under salinity stress, complete loss of function is catastrophically lethal under the challenge imposed.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A correctly states the core mechanism: a single-nucleotide substitution often yields a missense mutation affecting one amino acid (partial impairment), whereas a single-nucleotide insertion produces a frameshift that alters all downstream codons, yielding a non-functional protein.\n- B is incorrect because a single-nucleotide insertion does not cause large-scale chromosome structural damage that blocks transcription; RNA polymerase can transcribe through such point-level changes.\n- C is overly specific and generally incorrect: a premature stop codon need not arise immediately at the insertion site; it typically appears downstream as a consequence of the frameshift.\n- D mischaracterizes DNA repair: bacteria have mechanisms that can correct both substitutions and small insertions/deletions, but there is no general rule that substitutions are corrected while insertions are not; moreover, the phenotypic difference is best explained by functional consequences, not differential repair.\n- E is incorrect because the insertion occurs within the coding region after nucleotide 12 and does not affect the promoter, which is upstream of the transcription start site.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental molecular explanation is that the insertion caused a frameshift, producing a globally altered and non-functional protein, while the substitution likely caused only a missense change with partial function retained.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1975574"}, {"introduction": "While the ribosome ensures correct codon-anticodon pairing, the ultimate fidelity of the genetic code relies on the enzymes that 'charge' each tRNA with its proper amino acid. This practice [@problem_id:1975644] presents a thought experiment where one of these enzymes—an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase—is faulty. This scenario will challenge you to consider the profound, system-wide consequences when the cellular machinery responsible for interpreting the code itself makes a consistent error.", "problem": "The fidelity of protein synthesis is a cornerstone of cellular life, relying on the precise translation of the genetic code. This process is critically dependent on a class of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. In a hypothetical eukaryotic cell, a severe mutation occurs in the gene encoding for leucyl-tRNA synthetase. This mutated enzyme loses its specificity for its cognate amino acid, leucine, and instead consistently and exclusively attaches the amino acid proline to all transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules that have anticodons for leucine (tRNA^Leu). The mutated enzyme functions at a normal rate and is not degraded by the cell. All other cellular machinery, including the ribosome, other synthetases, and all tRNA molecules, are functioning correctly.\n\nWhich of the following statements describes the most immediate and widespread consequence for protein synthesis in this cell?\n\nA. The cell's DNA will be permanently altered, leading to the replacement of all genomic codons for leucine with codons for proline.\n\nB. The ribosome will stall and be unable to translate any mRNA codon that specifies leucine, effectively terminating protein synthesis.\n\nC. Nearly every newly synthesized protein in the cell will have proline substituted for leucine at all positions specified by leucine codons.\n\nD. The cell's ribosomal proofreading mechanisms will detect the incorrectly charged tRNA and prevent its use, causing a dramatic decrease in the overall rate of protein synthesis.", "solution": "1) Core principle of translational fidelity: The accuracy of amino acid incorporation during translation is primarily enforced by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which charge each tRNA with its correct cognate amino acid. The ribosome itself monitors codon-anticodon pairing in the decoding center but does not verify whether the amino acid attached to the tRNA matches the codon; thus, misacylated tRNAs can be accepted if their anticodon correctly base-pairs with the mRNA codon.\n\n2) Given perturbation: The leucyl-tRNA synthetase has lost specificity and now charges all $tRNA^{Leu}$ with proline, doing so at a normal rate and without degradation. All other components (ribosome, other synthetases, all tRNAs) function normally. Therefore, the cellular pool of $tRNA^{Leu}$ becomes efficiently and consistently misacylated with proline.\n\n3) Decoding at the ribosome: When the ribosome encounters any leucine codon (for example, UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG), elongation factor delivers a $tRNA^{Leu}$ whose anticodon correctly base-pairs with that codon. Because the ribosome’s selection mechanism depends on codon-anticodon complementarity and not on the identity of the attached amino acid, the mischarged $tRNA^{Leu}$ will be accepted.\n\n4) Peptide bond formation: The peptidyl transferase center catalyzes peptide bond formation using the amino acid on the accepted tRNA. Since $tRNA^{Leu}$ now carries proline, the ribosome will incorporate proline at every position where the mRNA specifies leucine.\n\n5) Rate and stalling considerations: Because the mischarging occurs at a normal rate and the codon-anticodon pairing remains correct, there is no intrinsic cause for ribosomal stalling at leucine codons. Translation continues at near-normal rates; there is no general termination or dramatic slowdown attributable to ribosomal proofreading of amino acid identity, which does not exist. The quality-control editing that would normally prevent misacylation resides in the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, which is mutated here and not compensated by the ribosome.\n\n6) Scope of impact: Leucine is among the most abundant amino acids in proteins. Consequently, nearly every newly synthesized protein that contains one or more leucine residues will instead incorporate proline at those positions, producing widespread amino acid substitutions throughout the proteome.\n\n7) Evaluation of options:\n- A is false because DNA sequence is not altered by translational errors; codons in the genome remain unchanged.\n- B is false because the ribosome reads codon-anticodon pairing and will not stall solely due to misacylation.\n- C is true: Proline will be substituted for leucine at all leucine codons, affecting nearly every newly synthesized protein.\n- D is false because ribosomal proofreading does not detect or reject incorrectly charged tRNAs; thus, there is no dramatic global decrease in translation rate due to such detection.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and widespread consequence is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1975644"}]}
