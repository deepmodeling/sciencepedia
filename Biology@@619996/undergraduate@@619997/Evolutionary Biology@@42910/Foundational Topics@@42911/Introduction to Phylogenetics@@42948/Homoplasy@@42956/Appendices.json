This exercise introduces the principle of maximum parsimony, a fundamental concept that favors the simplest explanation requiring the fewest evolutionary changes. By applying this principle, you will learn to distinguish between two key mechanisms of homoplasy: convergent evolution (independent gains) and evolutionary reversal (a gain followed by a loss) [@problem_id:1938402].", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is studying a group of five related species of Antarctic notothenioid fish, which we will label A, B, C, D, and E for simplicity. A recent molecular phylogenetic study has robustly determined their evolutionary relationships. Species A is an outgroup to the other four species. The remaining four species form a monophyletic group, within which the clade containing species B and C is the sister group to the clade containing species D and E.\n\nThe researchers are investigating the evolution of a specific antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP). The presence of this AFGP is considered a derived trait (state 1), and its absence is the ancestral state (state 0). The distribution of this specific AFGP among the five species is as follows: it is absent in species A, C, and D (state 0), but present in species B and E (state 1).\n\nTwo competing hypotheses are proposed to explain this distribution:\n- **Hypothesis 1 (Reversal):** The AFGP evolved once in a common ancestor of the affected species and was subsequently lost in one or more lineages.\n- **Hypothesis 2 (Convergence):** The AFGP evolved independently on at least two separate occasions.\n\nUsing the principle of maximum parsimony, which states that the preferred explanation is the one that requires the smallest number of evolutionary changes (gains or losses of the trait), determine the minimum number of evolutionary steps required for each hypothesis. Which of the following options correctly states the number of steps for Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2, respectively?\n\nA. H1: 2 steps; H2: 2 steps\n\nB. H1: 3 steps; H2: 2 steps\n\nC.

The character states at the tips are $A:0$, $B:1$, $C:0$, $D:0$, $E:1$, where state $1$ is derived and state $0$ is ancestral.\n\nUnder maximum parsimony, we minimize the total number of state changes along the branches to explain these tip states. We evaluate the minimum changes consistent with each hypothesis.\n\nFor Hypothesis 1 (Reversal), the trait evolves once in a common ancestor and is subsequently lost. To account for $B=1$ and $E=1$ with a single origin, the gain must occur at their most recent common ancestor. In this topology, the most recent common ancestor of $B$ and $E$ is the ancestor of the entire ingroup of four species. Placing a single gain at the base of the ingroup sets the ancestral state of the ingroup to $1$. To match the observed $C=0$ and $D=0$, there must be independent reversals (losses) on the branches leading to $C$ and to $D$. This yields exactly $1$ gain $+$ $2$ losses $=$ $3$ steps. Any alternative placement of the single gain either fails to explain both $B$ and $E$ without adding an additional gain (which violates the single-origin constraint) or requires additional losses (for example, a gain at the root including $A$ would require an extra loss on the branch to $A$), which increases the step count beyond $3$. Therefore, the minimum for Hypothesis 1 is $3$ steps.\n\nFor Hypothesis 2 (Convergence), the trait evolves independently on at least two occasions. The most parsimonious realization is to place one independent gain on the branch leading to $B$ and a second independent gain on the branch leading to $E$, with no losses required. This yields exactly $2$ steps. A single step is impossible because a single gain placed anywhere that affects both $B$ and $E$ would also affect either $C$ or $D$, necessitating at least one additional loss, which would not reduce the total below $2$. Thus, the minimum for Hypothesis 2 is $2$ steps.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is H1: $3$ steps; H2: $2$ steps, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1938402"}, {"introduction": "While morphology can suggest homoplasy, molecular data provides a powerful, independent line of evidence for testing evolutionary hypotheses.

You will apply the Jukes-Cantor model to a hypothetical scenario inspired by the classic example of tusks in elephants and walruses, quantifying the evidence for convergent evolution.", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, the distinction between homologous and analogous structures is fundamental. Homologous structures share a common ancestry, while analogous structures have similar functions but evolved independently through convergent evolution.\n\nConsider the tusks of elephants, which are modified incisors, and the tusks of walruses, which are modified canines. Their different developmental origins suggest they may be analogous. To investigate this, we can compare the genetic divergence of a key gene involved in odontogenesis.\n\nLet's model this scenario using a hypothetical gene called the `TOOTH-GROWTH-FACTOR` (`TGF`). The last common ancestor of the superorders containing elephants (Afrotheria) and walruses (Laurasiatheria) is estimated to have lived $T_{div} = 90.0$ million years ago. The neutral mutation rate for the `TGF` gene is estimated to be $\\mu = 1.60 \\times 10^{-9}$ substitutions per site per year.\n\nWe will evaluate the genetic data under two competing hypotheses:\n\n1.  **Hypothesis A (Convergent Evolution):** The tusk structures are analogous. Under this hypothesis, the `TGF` gene in the elephant lineage and the walrus lineage have been evolving independently since their divergence $T_{div}$ years ago.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis B (Shared Ancestry):** The tusk structures are homologous. An alternative study, based on a hypothetical fossil find, suggests a more recent common tusked ancestor. This paleontological model implies that the total number of nucleotide substitutions per site that has occurred between the `TGF` genes of elephants and walruses is $K_B = 0.240$.\n\nUsing the Jukes-Cantor model of nucleotide substitution, which relates the proportion of differing sites ($p$) to the number of substitutions per site ($K$) by the formula $p = \\frac{3}{4}(1 - \\exp(-\\frac{4}{3}K))$, calculate the ratio $\\frac{p_A}{p_B}$.

Using a well-resolved phylogeny of 20 species, she quantifies shell complexity on a discrete scale from 1 (simple, uncoiled) to 8 (highly complex, ornate coiling). The ancestral state for the clade is confidently inferred to be state 1. While most lineages show a trend of increasing complexity over geological time, the geologically youngest species in one subclade, *Neogastropodus simplex*, exhibits a simple, uncoiled shell (state 1), whereas its closest relatives all have highly complex shells (states 7 or 8).\n\nTwo competing hypotheses are proposed to explain this pattern:\n1.  **Reversal Hypothesis**: The simple shell of *N. simplex* is an evolutionary reversal, meaning its lineage re-evolved the ancestral simple state from a complex state.\n2.  **Irreversibility Hypothesis**: The evolution of this complex shell morphology involves the loss of underlying developmental pathways, making a true reversal to the simple state impossible (a concept related to Dollo's Law). The simple shell of *N. simplex* would therefore represent a new, convergent derivation of simplicity, mechanistically distinct from the ancestral state, possibly through a process like paedomorphosis.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, the paleontologist fits two discrete-state evolutionary models to the shell complexity data mapped onto the phylogeny.\n-   **Model M1 (Reversal-Permitted)**: An unrestricted model where the shell complexity state can change to any other state, including transitions from higher to lower complexity.

This model has fewer free parameters, $K_2 = 10$. The maximum log-likelihood for this model is $\\ln(L_2) = -25.20$.\n\nTo compare the fit of these two non-nested models, she uses the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which provides a measure of the relative quality of a statistical model for a given set of data.
