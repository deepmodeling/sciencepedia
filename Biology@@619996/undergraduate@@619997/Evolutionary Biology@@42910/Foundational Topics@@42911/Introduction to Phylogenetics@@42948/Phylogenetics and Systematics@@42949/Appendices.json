Based on morphological and behavioral observations, she identifies a striking trait—bioluminescence—that appears in several otherwise disparate organisms. She decides to create a new taxonomic group called \"Nocturna\" to encompass all bioluminescent life she has found so far. This group includes three species:\n\n1.  ***Arborlucens viridis***: A stationary, plant-like organism that uses chlorophyll-analogues for photosynthesis. Its leaves emit a continuous, soft green glow at night. Subsequent genetic sequencing reveals its most recent common ancestor is a species of non-luminescent, tree-like flora from the same forest.\n2.  ***Mycofulgur rapidus***: A fungus-like decomposer that grows on decaying organic matter. It produces rapid, blue flashes of light from its hyphal network, likely as a defense mechanism. Its lineage is known to be extremely ancient, having diverged from the lineage leading to *Arborlucens viridis* near the very root of the planet's eukaryotic-analogue tree of life.\n3.  ***Bestiola candens***: A motile, six-legged predator resembling an insect. It possesses a specialized organ on its head that pulses with a bright yellow light to attract prey. Phylogenetic analysis places it firmly within a large clade of non-luminescent arthropod-analogues.\n\nThe biologist's proposed group \"Nocturna\" consists solely of these three species. Based on modern principles of phylogenetic systematics, which of the following terms best describes the group \"Nocturna\"?\n\nA. Monophyletic\n\nB. Paraphyletic\n\nC. Polyphyletic\n\nD. Autapomorphic", "solution": "Define the relevant phylogenetic terms precisely:\n- A monophyletic group (clade) contains the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the included taxa and all of its descendants.\n- A paraphyletic group contains the MRCA of the included taxa but excludes some descendants.\n- A polyphyletic group does not include the MRCA of the included taxa; it is assembled based on convergent or analogous traits rather than shared ancestry.\n- Autapomorphic describes a derived trait unique to a single lineage; it is not a term for naming a group.\n\nApply these definitions to the proposed group \"Nocturna\":\n1. Each of the three species is placed in a distinct, otherwise non-luminescent lineage: a plant-like clade, a fungus-like clade that diverged very deeply from the plant-like lineage, and an arthropod-like clade. In each case, close relatives lack bioluminescence, indicating that bioluminescence evolved independently in each lineage.\n2. The smallest clade that would contain all three species would trace to a very deep MRCA (near the root of the eukaryote-analogue tree). The proposed group does not include that MRCA nor the vast majority of its descendants; rather, it cherry-picks distantly related taxa based solely on a convergent trait (bioluminescence).\n3. Therefore, the grouping is not monophyletic (it does not include the MRCA and all descendants) and not paraphyletic (it does not include the MRCA and then omit only some descendants). It is constructed around a homoplastic trait and excludes the MRCA, which matches the definition of a polyphyletic group.\n4. The term autapomorphic is inapplicable because it refers to a character state unique to one lineage, not to a multi-taxon group.\n\nConclusion: \"Nocturna\" is best described as polyphyletic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1954607"}, {"introduction": "The principle of parsimony, often described as a form of Occam's razor, is a fundamental concept in phylogenetics.

The primary focus is on a specific bioluminescent pigment used by these organisms for chemosynthesis in the dim light of their home worlds. This pigment can exist in one of three states: Blue (B), Green (G), or Red (R). Based on genomic data, the phylogenetic relationships between these species have been determined. The relationships and the observed pigment type for each species are as follows:\n\nThe phylogeny groups the six species—the Pandoran mold, the Yuggothian fungus, the Tatooinian slime, the Arrakian lichen, the Solarian protist, and the Trantorian algae—as described below:\n- The Pandoran mold and the Yuggothian fungus are sister species, forming Clade 1.\n- The Tatooinian slime and the Arrakian lichen are sister species, forming Clade 2.\n- Clade 2 is sister to the Solarian protist, and together they form Clade 3.\n- Clade 1 is sister to Clade 3.\n- The Trantorian algae is the outgroup, sister to the large clade containing all other five species.\n\nThe observed pigment types for the six extant species are:\n- Pandoran mold: Green (G)\n- Yuggothian fungus: Blue (B)\n- Tatooinian slime: Red (R)\n- Arrakian lichen: Green (G)\n- Solarian protist: Red (R)\n- Trantorian algae: Blue (B)\n\nAssuming that any pigment type can transition to any other type in a single evolutionary step, what is the absolute minimum number of evolutionary transitions required to explain the observed distribution of pigment types on this phylogeny?", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the most parsimonious reconstruction of ancestral character states, which corresponds to the minimum number of evolutionary changes (transitions) on the phylogenetic tree. We can use a method equivalent to Fitch's algorithm, which involves a two-pass process over the tree.\n\nFirst, let's establish the tree topology and label the internal nodes for clarity. The tips are the six species.\n- Tips: P (Pandoran, G), Y (Yuggothian, B), T (Tatooinian, R), A (Arrakian, G), S (Solarian, R), Tr (Trantorian, B).\n- Internal Node 1 (N1): The most recent common ancestor of P and Y.\n- Internal Node 2 (N2): The most recent common ancestor of T and A.\n- Internal Node 3 (N3): The most recent common ancestor of N2 and S.\n- Internal Node 4 (N4): The most recent common ancestor of N1 and N3.\n- Internal Node 5 (N5, the root): The most recent common ancestor of N4 and Tr.\n\nThe tree structure is: `((((T,A)N2, S)N3, (P,Y)N1)N4, Tr)N5`.\n\n**Pass 1: Bottom-up determination of ancestral state sets and counting changes.**\n\nWe traverse the tree from the tips to the root, determining the set of possible states for each internal node. We also maintain a running count of the minimum number of changes. Let the set of states for a node `u` be `StateSet(u)`. For an internal node `u` with children `v` and `w`:\n- If `StateSet(v)` and `StateSet(w)` have a non-empty intersection, then `StateSet(u) = StateSet(v) ∩ StateSet(w)`. No change is added.\n- If `StateSet(v)` and `StateSet(w)` have an empty intersection (they are disjoint), then `StateSet(u) = StateSet(v) ∪ StateSet(w)`.

The minimum number of evolutionary transitions required is 3.\n\n**Pass 2: Top-down assignment of states (for verification).**\n\nTo visualize where the changes occur, we can assign a single state to each internal node, starting from the root. When multiple states are possible, we choose one that is present in the parent node's state set to avoid counting an unnecessary change.\n\n1.  **Root N5:** `StateSet(N5) = {B}`. We must assign state B to N5. `State(N5) = B`.\n2.  **Node N4 (child of N5):** `State(N5) = B`. Since B is in `StateSet(N4) = {G, B, R}`, we can assign B to N4 to avoid a change on this branch. `State(N4) = B`.\n3.  **Node Tr (child of N5):** `State(N5) = B`. The tip state is also B. No change on the N5->Tr branch.\n4.  **Node N1 (child of N4):** `State(N4) = B`. Since B is in `StateSet(N1) = {G, B}`, we assign B to N1. `State(N1) = B`.\n5.  **Node N3 (child of N4):** `State(N4) = B`. B is not in `StateSet(N3) = {R}`. We must assign R to N3. This requires a change on the N4->N3 branch. **Change 1: B → R.**\n6.  **Node P (child of N1):** `State(N1) = B`. The tip state is G. This requires a change. **Change 2: B → G.**\n7.  **Node Y (child of N1):** `State(N1) = B`. The tip state is B. No change.\n8.  **Node S (child of N3):** `State(N3) = R`. The tip state is R. No change.\n9.  **Node N2 (child of N3):** `State(N3) = R`. Since R is in `StateSet(N2) = {R, G}`, we assign R to N2. `State(N2) = R`.\n10. **Node T (child of N2):** `State(N2) = R`. The tip state is R. No change.\n11. **Node A (child of N2):** `State(N2) = R`. The tip state is G.
