Consider the evolutionary relationships among four distinct species: the gray wolf (*Canis lupus*), the red fox (*Vulpes vulpes*), the house cat (*Felis catus*), and the American alligator (*Alligator mississippiensis*).\n\nPhylogenetic studies have established the following hierarchical relationships:\n1.  The gray wolf and the red fox both belong to the family Canidae.\n2.  The house cat belongs to the family Felidae.\n3.  Both the family Canidae and the family Felidae are part of the order Carnivora.\n4.  The American alligator belongs to the order Crocodilia, which is not part of the same class as Carnivora.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following pairs of species, when considered along with their most recent common ancestor, forms a monophyletic group that excludes the other two species?\n\nA.

Red fox and American alligator", "solution": "A monophyletic group is defined as a clade comprising a common ancestor and all of its descendants. For a pair of species to form a monophyletic group that excludes the other two species listed, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the pair must have as its descendant set (within the scope of these four species) only those two species and not include the other two.\n\nGiven the relationships:\n- Gray wolf and red fox are both in family Canidae, so their MRCA is the ancestor of Canidae. Within the set of four species, the descendants of this MRCA include the gray wolf and red fox, but not the house cat (Felidae, a separate family in Carnivora) and not the American alligator (Crocodilia, outside Mammalia). Therefore, the clade defined by the MRCA of gray wolf and red fox excludes the other two species.\n- Red fox and house cat have their MRCA at the level of order Carnivora. The clade rooted at this MRCA necessarily includes the gray wolf (also in Carnivora), so it does not exclude the gray wolf. Hence, options involving one canid and the cat (A and B) fail.\n- House cat and American alligator have their MRCA far deeper (at Amniota or earlier), which also includes both the gray wolf and red fox. Thus, C fails.\n- Red fox and American alligator likewise have an MRCA deep enough to include the gray wolf and house cat. Thus, E fails.\n\nOnly the pair gray wolf and red fox has an MRCA whose clade, restricted to these four species, includes only those two and excludes the other two species.

This thought experiment explores the consequences when a traditional group is discovered to be incomplete, a situation that leads to paraphyly. By re-evaluating the classification of a well-known group based on hypothetical new evidence, you will deepen your understanding of why monophyly is the cornerstone of modern systematics [@problem_id:1937265].", "problem": "In modern biological systematics, the goal is to create classifications that reflect evolutionary history. A key concept is the **monophyletic group**, or **clade**, which is defined as a group of organisms that includes a single common ancestor and all of its descendants. In contrast, a **paraphyletic group** includes a common ancestor but not all of its descendants.\n\nThe family Felidae (the cat family) is currently considered monophyletic. Within this family, the genus *Panthera* (which includes lions, tigers, and leopards) and the genus *Felis* (which includes the domestic cat and its close relatives) are recognized as two distinct, monophyletic genera. This implies they share a common ancestor further back in time, but neither group is descended from the other.\n\nNow, imagine that a wealth of new fossil and genetic evidence is discovered. This new evidence compellingly demonstrates that the entire lineage leading to the genus *Felis* actually originated from an ancestral species that existed *after* the most recent common ancestor of all species currently classified within the genus *Panthera*. Taxonomists decide to keep the genus *Felis* as a separate taxonomic group for historical and practical reasons.\n\nGiven this new, hypothetical evolutionary relationship, and the decision to maintain *Felis* as a separate genus, what would be the resulting classification status of the group currently designated as the genus *Panthera*?\n\nA. The genus *Panthera* would remain monophyletic.\n\nB. The genus *Panthera* would become paraphyletic.\n\nC. The genus *Panthera* would become polyphyletic.\n\nD. The family Felidae, as a whole, would become paraphyletic.\n\nE. The genus *Felis* would become paraphyletic.", "solution": "A monophyletic group (clade) can be defined formally as follows: for a rooted phylogeny, let $\\operatorname{Desc}(a)$ denote the set of all descendant lineages of node $a$. A group $G$ is monophyletic if there exists a node $a$ such that $G = \\operatorname{Desc}(a)$. A group is paraphyletic if there exists a node $a$ such that $G \\subset \\operatorname{Desc}(a)$ and $G \\neq \\operatorname{Desc}(a)$, that is, it includes the common ancestor and some but not all of its descendants. A group is polyphyletic if its members do not share a single more recent common ancestor within the grouping, which can be expressed as: there is no single node $a$ such that $G \\subset \\operatorname{Desc}(a)$ that captures all members without also requiring unrelated origins.\n\nInitially, let $P$ be the set of species in the genus Panthera and $F$ be the set of species in the genus Felis, with both $P$ and $F$ monophyletic and neither descended from the other. Let $a_{P}$ be the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of $P$, and $a_{F}$ be the MRCA of $F$, with both $a_{P}$ and $a_{F}$ descending from an ancestor within Felidae but on separate branches.\n\nThe new evidence states that the entire lineage leading to $F$ originated after the MRCA of $P$. Formally, this implies $a_{F}$ is a descendant of $a_{P}$, i.e., $a_{F} \\in \\operatorname{Desc}(a_{P})$, so $F \\subset \\operatorname{Desc}(a_{P})$. If taxonomists retain $F$ as a separate genus and keep $P$ as currently circumscribed (i.e., $P$ explicitly excludes $F$), then the current $P$ is missing a descendant lineage of $a_{P}$. Symbolically, $P = \\operatorname{Desc}(a_{P}) \\setminus F$ (up to other nested clades previously included), so $P \\subset \\operatorname{Desc}(a_{P})$ and $P \\neq \\operatorname{Desc}(a_{P})$.\n\nBy the definitions above, this makes $P$ paraphyletic: it includes the common ancestor $a_{P}$ and some, but not all, of its descendants (it excludes the descendant clade $F$). It is not polyphyletic, because all members of $P$ still share the MRCA $a_{P}$ within the tree. The family Felidae need not change status and can remain monophyletic because it can still be defined as all descendants of the MRCA of Felidae. The genus Felis can remain monophyletic if it still includes all descendants of its own MRCA $a_{F}$.\n\nTherefore, under the stated scenario and the decision to retain Felis as a separate genus, the group currently designated as Panthera becomes paraphyletic.\n\nThus the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1937265"}]}
