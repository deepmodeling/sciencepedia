This exercise addresses this misconception directly, forcing you to distinguish between the arbitrary visual layout of a tree diagram and its true branching structure, or topology. By working through this scenario [@problem_id:1959173], you will solidify your understanding that evolutionary relationships are determined solely by tracing back to the most recent common ancestor, not by the left-to-right order of the labels.", "problem": "An undergraduate student, Alex, is studying a phylogenetic tree that depicts the evolutionary relationships among several major groups of organisms. The tree's structure is described textually as follows:\n\nThe base of the tree represents the universal common ancestor for all groups shown. This root splits into two primary lineages. One of these primary lineages leads directly to the domain Bacteria. The other primary lineage leads to a node representing the common ancestor of the domains Archaea and Eukarya.\n\nFrom this Archaea-Eukarya ancestral node, the lineage splits into two branches: one branch terminates at the domain Archaea, and the other leads to the domain Eukarya.\n\nWithin the Eukarya branch, the lineage first splits to separate the kingdom Plantae from another lineage. This other lineage continues to a subsequent node which represents the common ancestor of the kingdoms Fungi and Animalia. This final node then splits into the two terminal branches for Fungi and Animalia.\n\nOn the particular drawing of the tree that Alex is observing, the terminal branches are arranged on the page such that the tip labeled \"Fungi\" is physically located next to the tip labeled \"Plantae\", while the tip for \"Animalia\" is positioned further away. Based on this observation, Alex makes the following claim: \"Fungi are more closely related to Plants than to Animals because their tips on the tree diagram are adjacent to each other.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate scientific evaluation of Alex's claim?\n\nA. Alex is correct. The spatial proximity of terminal branches on a phylogenetic tree is how evolutionary relatedness is determined.\nB. Alex is incorrect. According to the described branching pattern, Fungi and Animalia share a common ancestor that is not shared with Plantae, making them more closely related to each other.\nC. Alex is incorrect. Fungi are most closely related to Bacteria, as they are both simple organisms compared to the complexity of Plants and Animals.\nD. Alex's claim cannot be evaluated from the description alone, as the length of the branches, not their position, determines relatedness.\nE. Alex is correct in principle, but for the wrong reason. Fungi and Plantae are more closely related because there are fewer branching events (nodes) separating them from the universal common ancestor.", "solution": "I identify the criterion for evolutionary relatedness on a phylogenetic tree: relatedness is determined by the most recent common ancestor (MRCA). Two taxa are more closely related if they share a more recent common ancestor with each other than either does with a third taxon. This criterion depends on the branching topology, not on the physical proximity of tips on the page. Rotating branches around nodes leaves the topology (and thus relatedness) unchanged.\n\nI reconstruct the described topology:\n- The root splits into two primary lineages: one to Bacteria, the other to the common ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya.\n- That node splits into Archaea and Eukarya.\n- Within Eukarya, the first split separates Plantae from a lineage whose subsequent node is the common ancestor of Fungi and Animalia.\n- That final node splits into Fungi and Animalia.\n\nFrom this, within Eukarya, Plantae diverges first, and Fungi and Animalia share a more recent common ancestor with each other than either shares with Plantae. Therefore, by the MRCA criterion, Fungi are more closely related to Animalia than to Plantae.\n\nI evaluate each option against these principles:\n- A is incorrect: spatial proximity of terminal tips on the drawing does not determine relatedness; topology and MRCA do.\n- B is correct: Fungi and Animalia share a common ancestor not shared with Plantae, so they are sister groups and more closely related to each other.\n- C is incorrect: Fungi are eukaryotes and are far more closely related to Animals than to Bacteria; Bacteria diverged at the earliest split described.\n- D is incorrect: The description provides sufficient topology to evaluate relatedness. Moreover, relatedness is not determined by branch length; even when branch lengths indicate time or change, sister relationships are determined by topology.\n- E is incorrect: Counting the number of branching events from the root is not the criterion for relatedness; the MRCA is.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate scientific evaluation is that Alex is incorrect and that Fungi are more closely related to Animalia than to Plantae based on the branching pattern described.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1959173"}, {"introduction": "Having established that topology is key, we can now apply this skill to explore the frontiers of modern biology.

Consider a simplified, hypothetical phylogenetic tree based on these modern findings. The relationships between the major domains and superphyla are described as follows:\n\nThe root of all life represents the last universal common ancestor, which diverged into two primary lineages. One lineage led to the domain Bacteria. The other lineage comprises all Archaea and Eukarya.\n\nThis second lineage, containing the common ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya, subsequently diverged. The first group to branch off from this lineage was the superphylum Euryarchaeota. The remaining lineage continued to evolve.\n\nThis continuing lineage then split into two new branches. One branch exclusively contains the organisms of the TACK superphylum (an acronym for the phyla Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Korarchaeota). The other branch contains the ancestors of both the Asgard superphylum and the domain Eukarya.\n\nFinally, this last branch itself diverged, yielding two distinct sister groups: the Asgard superphylum and the domain Eukarya.\n\nBased on this precise set of evolutionary relationships, which of the following groups is the sister taxon to the domain Eukarya?\n\nA.

Thus, Bacteria is an outgroup relative to the Archaea+Eukarya lineage and cannot be the sister taxon to Eukarya.\n2) Within the Archaea+Eukarya lineage, Euryarchaeota is the first branch to diverge; therefore, it is more basal relative to the Eukarya lineage and cannot be the sister taxon to Eukarya.\n3) The remaining lineage splits into TACK and a lineage that contains Asgard plus Eukarya. Because TACK diverges before the split that yields Eukarya, TACK is not the sister group to Eukarya.\n4) Finally, that last lineage bifurcates into Asgard and Eukarya. By definition of sister taxa, these two are sister groups.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A (Bacteria): outgroup to Archaea+Eukarya; not sister to Eukarya.\n- B (Euryarchaeota): diverged earlier; not the closest relative.\n- C (TACK superphylum): diverged before the Asgard+Eukarya split; not sister.\n- D (Asgard superphylum): direct sister group to Eukarya at the final bifurcation.\n- E (Entire Archaea): includes clades (e.g., Euryarchaeota, TACK) that diverged before the Eukarya-Asgard split; not a sister taxon to Eukarya.\n\nTherefore, the sister taxon to the domain Eukarya is the Asgard superphylum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1959174"}, {"introduction": "So far, we have interpreted pre-existing trees.
