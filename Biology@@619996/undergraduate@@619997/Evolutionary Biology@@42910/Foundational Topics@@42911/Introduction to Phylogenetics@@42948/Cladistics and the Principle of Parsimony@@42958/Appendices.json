The Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) bases observed at this specific site for the three species are:\n- Species Alpha: Adenine (A)\n- Species Beta: Guanine (G)\n- Species Gamma: Cytosine (C)\n\nTo evaluate the evolutionary cost of this character distribution on the tree, a weighted parsimony approach is used. The cost of a nucleotide substitution depends on whether it is a transition or a transversion. Purines are A and G; pyrimidines are C and T. A transition is a substitution between the two purines (A ↔ G) or between the two pyrimidines. A transversion is a substitution between a purine and a pyrimidine. The substitution cost scheme is as follows:\n- The cost of no change is 0.\n- The cost of a transition is 1.\n- The cost of a transversion is 2.\n\nUsing the Sankoff algorithm, a dynamic programming method for ancestral state reconstruction, calculate the minimum total cost (the parsimony score) for the entire unrooted tree for this single nucleotide site.
