[@problem_id:1964539]", "problem": "A mycologist is investigating the evolutionary relationships among five newly discovered species of fungi that inhabit forest leaf litter, designated Species A, B, C, D, and E. To construct a phylogeny, the mycologist sequences a homologous region of the large subunit (28S) ribosomal RNA gene from all five species. For comparison, the same gene region from a known, more distantly related fungus is used as an outgroup to determine the ancestral state of any observed genetic variations.\n\nThe sequence alignment reveals a notable feature: a specific four-base-pair insertion is found at the same position within the gene in Species C and Species D. This exact insertion is absent in the outgroup species, and it is also absent in Species A, B, and E. Other genetic differences were observed among the species, but this insertion provides a particularly unambiguous signal.\n\nIn phylogenetic analysis, a character that is derived from an ancestral state and shared by two or more taxa is known as a synapomorphy, and it serves as evidence for a monophyletic group (a clade). Based solely on the evidence of this four-base-pair insertion, which of the following statements is the most accurate conclusion?\n\nA. Species C and Species D form a monophyletic group.\n\nB.

The presence of the same insertion in Species C and D is best explained by convergent evolution.\n\nE. Species C is the direct ancestor of Species D.", "solution": "We want to infer relationships among five ingroup species using a single, unambiguous character: a four-base-pair insertion present only in Species C and D. The outgroup lacks this insertion, so outgroup comparison polarizes the character states: the absence is the ancestral (plesiomorphic) state, and the presence is the derived (apomorphic) state. This follows the standard principle of character polarity determined by an outgroup.\n\nA synapomorphy is a derived character shared by two or more taxa and indicates that those taxa form a monophyletic group. Because the insertion is derived (absent in the outgroup) and shared by exactly C and D, it is a synapomorphy uniting C and D.\n\nUnder maximum parsimony, we compare possible explanations for the observed distribution:\n- A single insertion event on the branch leading to the most recent common ancestor of C and D explains both C and D having the insertion with one change.\n- Convergent evolution would require two independent insertions at the same site and with the same four-base length (at least two changes), which is less parsimonious and less likely.\n- A scenario in which the insertion is ancestral would require gains followed by multiple losses to explain its absence in the outgroup and in A, B, and E, which is even less parsimonious.\n\nTherefore, the most supported conclusion is that C and D share a derived character indicating they form a monophyletic group.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A. Species C and Species D form a monophyletic group: True; supported by a shared derived character (synapomorphy).\n- B. Species A, B, and E form a monophyletic group: Not supported; they share the ancestral (absent) state, which is not evidence of monophyly.\n- C. The insertion is an ancestral character for Aâ€“E: False; the outgroup lacks it, so the ancestral state is absence.\n- D. Best explained by convergent evolution: Less parsimonious than a single shared origin; disfavored.\n- E. Species C is the direct ancestor of D: Phylogenetic analyses infer shared common ancestry, not direct ancestry among extant taxa.\n\nThus, the most accurate conclusion is that C and D form a monophyletic group.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1964539"}, {"introduction": "Nature is replete with examples of organisms that look similar but are not closely related. This practice challenges you to reconcile conflicting data, a common task in evolutionary biology. When a morphological trait suggests one relationship but robust molecular data suggests another, we must use logic to uncover the true evolutionary story, which often involves distinguishing shared ancestry (synapomorphy) from convergent evolution (homoplasy). [@problem_id:1964531]", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying speciation and adaptation in a genus of ground beetles, *Anopthalmus*. The analysis includes four species within this genus and one species from a closely related genus, *Carabus*, which serves as the outgroup. The outgroup *Carabus maximus* is a surface-dwelling beetle with dark pigmentation.\n\nWithin the genus *Anopthalmus*, there are two surface-dwelling species, *A. terrestris* and *A. solis*, both of which possess dark pigmentation similar to the outgroup. There are also two cave-dwelling species, *A. speluncus* and *A. troglodytes*. Both of these cave-dwelling species completely lack pigmentation (i.e., they are depigmented).\n\nTo determine the evolutionary history of the group, the biologist constructs a phylogenetic tree based on a large dataset of neutral DNA sequences from all five species. The resulting, highly-supported phylogeny reveals the following relationships:\n1.  The surface-dwelling species *A. terrestris* is the closest relative (sister taxon) to the cave-dwelling species *A. speluncus*.\n2.  The surface-dwelling species *A. solis* is the closest relative (sister taxon) to the cave-dwelling species *A. troglodytes*.\n3.  The clade formed by (*A. terrestris* + *A. speluncus*) and the clade formed by (*A. solis* + *A. troglodytes*) are themselves sister groups.\n\nBased on all the evidence provided, which of the following statements is the most accurate conclusion regarding the evolution of depigmentation in these beetles?\n\nA. The lack of pigmentation is an example of convergent evolution, as the trait likely evolved independently in the two cave-dwelling lineages.\n\nB. The lack of pigmentation is a shared derived character (synapomorphy) for the cave-dwelling species, indicating they form a monophyletic group.\n\nC. The lack of pigmentation is an ancestral character state (plesiomorphy), so it provides no useful information about relationships within the genus *Anopthalmus*.\n\nD. The molecular DNA data must be incorrect, because it contradicts the morphological evidence that the two depigmented species should be each other's closest relatives.\n\nE. The two cave-dwelling species inherited the lack of pigmentation from a common depigmented ancestor, and one of the surface-dwelling lineages must have re-evolved pigmentation.", "solution": "Use the outgroup method to polarize the character state: since the outgroup, Carabus maximus, is surface-dwelling and darkly pigmented, the ancestral state for pigmentation in the ingroup (Anopthalmus) is dark pigmentation. This inference follows the standard principle that the state observed in the outgroup is taken as the most likely ancestral state for the ingroup unless strong contrary evidence exists.\n\nMap the character states onto the given, well-supported phylogeny: the tree is structured as sister pairs (A. terrestris [dark] with A. speluncus [depigmented]) and (A. solis [dark] with A. troglodytes [depigmented]), and these two clades are sister groups to each other. Thus, each depigmented cave species is paired with a dark surface relative.\n\nApply parsimony to reconstruct character evolution: with the ancestral state inferred as dark, the most parsimonious reconstruction of depigmentation is two independent losses of pigmentation, one on the branch leading to A. speluncus and one on the branch leading to A. troglodytes. This requires two changes in total.\n\nEvaluate alternative scenarios and their change counts. If depigmentation were a single shared derived state for the two cave species (i.e., a synapomorphy), then either:\n- the ancestor of the clade containing all four Anopthalmus species would have to be depigmented, forcing independent re-gains of pigmentation in both A. terrestris and A. solis (two gains) in addition to at least one loss from the dark outgroup to that ancestor (one loss), totaling at least three changes; or\n- the ancestor of just one of the two sister clades would be depigmented, which fails to explain depigmentation in the other clade without additional ad hoc events. Any such scenario is less parsimonious than two independent losses.\n\nTherefore, depigmentation is best explained as convergent evolution (homoplasy) in the two cave lineages. This directly supports option A and rejects:\n- B, because the cave species do not form a monophyletic group on the DNA tree and depigmentation is not a synapomorphy uniting them;\n- C, because the ancestral state is dark (established by the outgroup), not depigmented;\n- D, because the molecular phylogeny is consistent with convergence in cave adaptations and does not contradict sound evolutionary reasoning;\n- E, because it requires a less parsimonious combination of ancestral loss and multiple re-gains of pigmentation despite the outgroup indicating ancestral darkness.\n\nThus, the most accurate conclusion is that depigmentation evolved independently in the two cave-dwelling lineages, indicating convergent evolution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1964531"}, {"introduction": "To scientifically test hypotheses about evolutionary history, biologists need a quantitative method to compare them.
