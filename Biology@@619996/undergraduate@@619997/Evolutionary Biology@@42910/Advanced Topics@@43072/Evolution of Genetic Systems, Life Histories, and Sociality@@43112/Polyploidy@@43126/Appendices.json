This exercise explores autopolyploidy, where an organism possesses more than two sets of chromosomes derived from a single species. By calculating the chromosome number in an autotriploid plant [@problem_id:1511155], you will practice relating the diploid number ($2n$), the basic chromosome number ($n$), and the new polyploid number, a core skill for any cytogenetic analysis.", "problem": "A botanist is studying a newly discovered species of wild primrose. Through cytological analysis of its root tip cells, she determines that the plant is diploid and has a somatic chromosome number of 18. During her research, she identifies a naturally occurring variant in the population that exhibits significantly larger flowers and leaves, a common characteristic of polyploidy. Genetic testing confirms this variant is an autotriploid. Calculate the total number of chromosomes that would be found in a somatic cell (e.g., a leaf cell) of this autotriploid primrose variant.", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the chromosome number in a somatic cell of an autotriploid plant, given the chromosome number of its diploid progenitor.\n\nStep 1: Understand the given information.\nThe somatic cells of the original diploid primrose plant contain 18 chromosomes. A diploid organism has two sets of chromosomes, which is denoted as $2n$. Therefore, we have the equation:\n$$2n = 18$$\n\nStep 2: Determine the basic chromosome number, $n$.\nThe basic chromosome number, $n$, represents the number of chromosomes in a single, complete set (a haploid set). We can solve for $n$ from the equation in Step 1:\n$$n = \\frac{18}{2} = 9$$\nSo, a single set of chromosomes for this primrose species consists of 9 chromosomes.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the chromosome number for the autotriploid variant.\nThe term \"autotriploid\" means the organism has three complete sets of chromosomes, all derived from the same species. The ploidy level is therefore $3n$. To find the total number of chromosomes in a somatic cell of the autotriploid plant, we multiply the basic chromosome number, $n$, by 3.\n$$\\text{Chromosome number of autotriploid} = 3n$$\nSubstituting the value of $n=9$ we found in Step 2:\n$$\\text{Chromosome number of autotriploid} = 3 \\times 9 = 27$$\n\nThus, a somatic cell of the autotriploid primrose variant would contain 27 chromosomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{27}$$", "id": "1511155"}, {"introduction": "Polyploidy is a powerful force in evolution, particularly in plants, where it can lead to rapid speciation through allopolyploidyâ€”the combination of chromosome sets from different species. This practice [@problem_id:1511141] walks you through a classic plant breeding scenario, illustrating how chromosome doubling can overcome hybrid sterility to create a completely new, fertile species. This process is a key mechanism that has generated significant biodiversity in the plant kingdom.", "problem": "A plant breeder is engaged in a project to create a new, hardy species of ornamental flower by hybridizing two different diploid species. The first parent, Species A, has a diploid somatic chromosome number of $2n=8$. The second parent, Species B, has a diploid somatic chromosome number of $2n=10$.\n\nThe breeder successfully crosses Species A and Species B, producing a viable hybrid offspring. However, this hybrid plant is sterile because its chromosomes, derived from two different species, fail to form homologous pairs during meiosis. To restore fertility, the breeder applies a chemical treatment to the hybrid seedling, which induces a doubling of the entire chromosome set within its somatic cells. This process creates a new, fertile plant species known as an allopolyploid.\n\nWhat is the diploid somatic chromosome number ($2n$) of this new, fertile allopolyploid plant?", "solution": "Let the diploid somatic chromosome numbers of the parents be denoted by $2n_{A}$ and $2n_{B}$, where:\n$$2n_{A}=8 \\implies n_{A}=4,$$\n$$2n_{B}=10 \\implies n_{B}=5.$$\n\nA hybrid formed by crossing these species receives one haploid set from each parent, so its somatic chromosome number is the sum of the parental haploid numbers:\n$$\\text{Hybrid somatic number} = n_{A} + n_{B} = 4 + 5 = 9.$$\nThis hybrid is sterile because the chromosomes from the two species lack homologs for proper pairing during meiosis.\n\nInducing chromosome doubling in the hybrid duplicates the entire set, creating an allopolyploid in which each chromosome now has a homolog from its duplicated subgenome. The resulting somatic chromosome number is:\n$$2(n_{A} + n_{B}) = 2(4 + 5) = 18.$$\n\nTherefore, the diploid somatic chromosome number of the new, fertile allopolyploid is $18$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{18}$$", "id": "1511141"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply increasing chromosome numbers, polyploidy dramatically alters the patterns of genetic inheritance. To predict the traits of polyploid offspring, we must first understand how their uniquely complex gametes are formed during meiosis. This foundational exercise [@problem_id:1511157] delves into the genetics of an autotetraploid, guiding you to determine the expected ratios of different allelic combinations in its gametes, a crucial step for applying genetic principles to polyploid organisms.", "problem": "A plant breeder is working with a species of ornamental flower where a single gene controls the production of fragrance. The dominant allele, denoted as `F`, codes for a fragrant phenotype, while the recessive allele, `f`, results in a non-fragrant phenotype. The breeder starts with a diploid plant that is heterozygous for this gene, having the genotype `Ff`. By treating this plant with a chemical agent that disrupts mitosis, the breeder successfully creates a fertile autotetraploid descendant.\n\nDuring meiosis in this autotetraploid plant, assume that the four homologous chromosomes carrying this gene pair up to form a quadrivalent. Subsequently, these chromosomes segregate randomly, such that each resulting diploid gamete receives exactly two of the four homologous chromosomes.\n\nDetermine the expected ratio of the three possible gamete genotypes (`FF` : `Ff` : `ff`). Provide your answer as the three corresponding integers that form this ratio for `FF`, `Ff`, and `ff`, respectively.", "solution": "The diploid progenitor is heterozygous $Ff$. Chromosome doubling creates an autotetraploid with genotype $FFff$, i.e., two homologs carrying $F$ and two homologs carrying $f$.\n\nUnder the stated assumption of quadrivalent formation and random segregation of the four homologous chromosomes into diploid gametes, each gamete receives exactly two of the four homologs. This is equivalent to sampling without replacement of two chromosomes from the multiset $\\{F,F,f,f\\}$, with all $\\binom{4}{2}$ pairs equally likely.\n\nCount the numbers of pairs that yield each gamete genotype:\n- $FF$ arises only by choosing both $F$-bearing homologs: the number of such pairs is $\\binom{2}{2}=1$.\n- $ff$ arises only by choosing both $f$-bearing homologs: the number of such pairs is $\\binom{2}{2}=1$.\n- $Ff$ arises by choosing one $F$-bearing and one $f$-bearing homolog: the number of such mixed pairs is $\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{1}=4$.\n\nThe total number of equally likely pairs is $\\binom{4}{2}=6$, so the ratio of $FF:Ff:ff$ is\n$$\n1:4:1.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 4 & 1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1511157"}]}
