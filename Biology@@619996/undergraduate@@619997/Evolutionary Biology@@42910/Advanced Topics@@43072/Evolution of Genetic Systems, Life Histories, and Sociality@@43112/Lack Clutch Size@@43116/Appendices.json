Consider a hypothetical lizard species, *Lacerta ficticius*, where females invest a fixed amount of energy into reproduction each season. They can allocate this energy in one of two ways, leading to two distinct clutch strategies.\n\nStrategy A involves producing a small clutch of 5 large, well-provisioned eggs. The large size of these eggs gives each individual offspring a higher chance of survival. The probability of any single egg from this clutch hatching and the lizard surviving to become an independent juvenile is 40%.\n\nStrategy B involves producing a large clutch of 10 smaller, less-provisioned eggs. The smaller size of these eggs means each individual offspring has a lower chance of survival. The probability of any single egg from this clutch hatching and the lizard surviving to become an independent juvenile is 25%.\n\nAssume that the survival of each egg is an independent event. From an evolutionary perspective, the strategy that produces more surviving offspring, on average, will be favored by natural selection.
