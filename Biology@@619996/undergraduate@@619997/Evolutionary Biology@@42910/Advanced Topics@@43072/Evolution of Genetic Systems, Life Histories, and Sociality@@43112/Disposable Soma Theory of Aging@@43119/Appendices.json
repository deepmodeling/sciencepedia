This first practice places you in the role of an evolutionary biologist interpreting the results of a long-term experiment. By predicting the outcome of selecting for late-life fertility in fruit flies, you'll engage directly with the central trade-off proposed by the disposable soma theory: the allocation of limited resources between reproduction and bodily maintenance [@problem_id:1919203].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist conducts a long-term experiment on a population of fruit flies (*Drosophila melanogaster*). The experiment is designed to test predictions of the disposable soma theory of aging. A large, captive population is split into two groups: a control line and a selected line.\n\nIn the control line, flies are allowed to reproduce at random throughout their lives to generate the subsequent generation.\n\nIn the selected line, a strong artificial selection pressure is applied: for each new generation, only the eggs laid by the oldest surviving 10% of females are collected and used to propagate the line. This process is repeated for over 100 generations, allowing for significant evolutionary change.\n\nThe disposable soma theory proposes that there is an evolutionary trade-off between investing resources in reproduction versus investing in somatic maintenance (i.e., the repair and upkeep of the body). Based on this theory, which of the following outcomes, when comparing the selected line to the control line after many generations, would provide the strongest evidence for the theory?\n\nA. The selected line evolves a significantly shorter average lifespan but shows a massive increase in the number of eggs laid during the first few days of adulthood.\n\nB. The selected line shows no significant change in average lifespan, but the females lay a greater total number of eggs over their entire lives.\n\nC. The selected line evolves a significantly longer average lifespan, but this comes at the cost of reduced fecundity (fewer eggs laid per day) early in their reproductive lives.\n\nD. The selected line evolves a significantly longer average lifespan and also demonstrates increased fecundity at all ages compared to the control line.\n\nE. The selected line becomes sterile, and the population collapses, demonstrating that selection for late-life traits is inherently unsustainable.", "solution": "We start from the disposable soma theory, which posits a resource allocation trade-off between somatic maintenance and reproduction: investing more in somatic repair and maintenance increases survival and delays senescence but reduces resources available for reproduction, particularly early-life fecundity. This can be represented schematically by a constrained resource budget,\n$$\nR = S + F,\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the available resource budget, $S$ is allocation to somatic maintenance, and $F$ is allocation to reproduction. Under a fixed or limited $R$, an increase in $S$ implies a decrease in $F$.\n\nIn the experiment, the selected line is propagated only from the eggs laid by the oldest surviving 10% of females each generation. This imposes directional selection on survival and reproductive ability at late ages. Under the disposable soma theory, the predicted evolutionary response to selection for late-life reproduction is:\n- Increased $S$ to maintain soma and delay senescence, yielding a longer average lifespan and sustained late-life function.\n- A correlated reduction in early-life fecundity due to the trade-off (since $R$ is limited and $S$ has increased, early $F$ should decrease).\n- Potential shifts in the age-specific reproductive schedule $b(t)$ toward later ages, with increased late-life performance coming at the cost of reduced early performance.\n\nNow, evaluate the options against these predictions:\n- Option A (shorter lifespan, higher early eggs) describes evolution in the opposite direction: increased early reproduction and reduced maintenance leading to shorter lifespan. This contradicts the predicted response to selection for late-life reproduction and does not support the disposable soma theory in this context.\n- Option B (no lifespan change, greater lifetime fecundity) shows increased reproduction without the expected lifespan change or trade-off signal. This does not provide strong evidence for disposable soma’s allocation trade-off under late-life selection.\n- Option C (longer lifespan with reduced early fecundity) matches the key prediction: selection for late-life reproduction leads to increased somatic maintenance (longer lifespan) at the cost of reduced early reproduction (lower early fecundity), consistent with $R = S + F$ and the trade-off.\n- Option D (longer lifespan and increased fecundity at all ages) indicates a simultaneous improvement in both maintenance and reproduction without cost, which contradicts the core trade-off posited by disposable soma. Such an outcome would undermine, not support, the theory.\n- Option E (sterility and collapse) is neither predicted by the theory nor informative about the soma-reproduction trade-off; it does not constitute supportive evidence.\n\nTherefore, the strongest evidence for the disposable soma theory in this selection regime is a longer average lifespan accompanied by reduced early-life fecundity, which is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1919203"}, {"introduction": "The disposable soma theory predicts that the optimal investment in somatic maintenance is not fixed, but depends critically on the environment.

The intrinsic mortality rate is inversely proportional to the energy allocated to somatic maintenance.\n\nA novel mutation arises in a population of this organism. This mutation has two distinct effects:\n1.  **Benefit**: It doubles the efficiency of somatic maintenance.

Consider a hypothetical iteroparous organism with a maximum potential lifespan allowing for three reproductive seasons after reaching sexual maturity.

Fitness is determined solely by its Lifetime Reproductive Success (LRS), defined as the total expected number of offspring produced over its entire life.\n\n**Strategy A (Fixed Allocator):** This is a baseline strategy involving a constant allocation of resources.
