This practice challenges you to compare two reproductive strategies in a fluctuating environment: one that maximizes the simple average (arithmetic mean) payoff and another that diversifies its investment. By calculating and comparing the long-term fitness of each strategy using the geometric mean, you will directly observe why the strategy with the lower average return can ultimately triumph in the long run [@problem_id:1911518].", "problem": "A hypothetical species of annual plant, *Semen aleatorius*, lives in an environment that fluctuates predictably between \"Wet\" and \"Dry\" years, with each type of year occurring with a probability of 50%. The plant is dioecious, meaning individuals are either male or female. A parent plant can control the sex ratio of the seeds it produces. The reproductive success of its offspring (measured in the number of surviving grand-offspring each produces) depends on the environmental conditions of the year they mature in, as follows:\n\n*   In a **Wet year**: The average son produces 0.5 grand-offspring. The average daughter produces 2.0 grand-offspring.\n*   In a **Dry year**: The average son produces 5.0 grand-offspring. The average daughter produces 1.0 grand-offspring.\n\nWe will compare two different reproductive strategies a parent plant could employ:\n\n*   **Strategy A (The \"Arithmetic-Mean Maximizer\"):** This strategy involves producing only the sex that has the higher arithmetic mean reproductive success, averaged across both Wet and Dry years.\n*   **Strategy B (The \"Bet-Hedger\"):** This strategy involves producing an equal number of sons and daughters (a 1:1 sex ratio).\n\nIn evolutionary biology, the long-term fitness of a lineage in a fluctuating environment is best measured by the geometric mean of its reproductive output across generations, not the arithmetic mean, because population growth is a multiplicative process.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the long-term fitness of Strategy B to the long-term fitness of Strategy A.

Many natural populations exhibit polymorphism, where a fraction $x$ of individuals use one strategy and a fraction $1-x$ uses another; this diversity itself can be a form of bet-hedging. This problem asks you to model a population of desert plants to find the evolutionarily stable fraction of 'eager' germinators, introducing the powerful technique of maximizing the expected log-fitness to solve for an optimal mixed strategy [@problem_id:1911548].", "problem": "A species of desert annual plant has evolved a bet-hedging strategy to cope with an unpredictable environment. In any given year, the rainfall pattern can be one of two types. A 'Good' year, which occurs with probability $p$, has an early start to the rainy season, allowing for a long growth period. A 'Bad' year, which occurs with probability $1-p$, begins with a brief, deceptive 'false' rain followed by a lethal dry spell before the true rainy season starts much later.\n\nThe plant population consists of two genetically determined phenotypes with different germination strategies:\n1.  **Eager Germinators**: These seeds germinate at the very first sign of moisture. In a 'Good' year, they take full advantage of the long growing season and produce a high number of offspring seeds, $W_E$. In a 'Bad' year, they germinate during the false rain and perish before they can reproduce, yielding 0 seeds.\n2.  **Cautious Germinators**: These seeds require a more sustained period of moisture to germinate, causing them to start growing later. In a 'Good' year, they miss the initial part of the growing season and produce a moderate number of offspring seeds, $W_C$. In a 'Bad' year, their cautious strategy allows them to ignore the false rain and germinate only when the true, later rainy season begins, also yielding $W_C$ seeds.\n\nAssume that $W_E > W_C > 0$. The long-term success of the population depends on maximizing its geometric mean fitness across years. Consider a polymorphic population where a fraction $x$ of the seeds are Eager Germinators and the remaining fraction $1-x$ are Cautious Germinators. Find the optimal fraction of Eager Germinators, $x^*$, that maximizes the long-term geometric mean fitness of the population.

This practice explores a classic trade-off: how much energy, a fraction $x$, should be allocated to low-risk dispersal versus the remaining fraction, $1-x$, to high-risk local growth? By applying the same fitness-maximization framework, you will reinforce your skills and see how general this evolutionary logic is for navigating uncertain futures [@problem_id:1911540].", "problem": "A species of sessile, colonial marine organism, similar to a coral, faces an evolutionary trade-off in its resource allocation strategy. Each year, an established colony allocates its total available energy between two functions: colonial growth and larval dispersal. A fraction of energy, $(1-x)$, is invested in increasing the size of the parent colony, while the remaining fraction, $x$, is used to produce mobile larvae that disperse to establish new colonies.\n\nThe returns on these investments are defined as follows:\n- An investment in growth yields a reproductive return factor of $g$. That is, one unit of energy invested in growth increases the colony's reproductive potential by a factor of $g$ in the following year. It is given that $g > 1$.\n- An investment in dispersal yields a reproductive return factor of $b$. That is, one unit of energy invested in dispersal results in a total reproductive potential of $b$ from all newly founded colonies in the following year. Typically, growing an existing colony is more efficient than establishing new ones, so it is given that $g > b$.\n\nThe environment is unpredictable. Each year, there is a small but non-zero probability, $p$, of a catastrophic event (e.g., a localized storm or disease outbreak) that completely destroys the parent colony. The larvae, having already dispersed, are unaffected by this event. If the catastrophe does not occur (with probability $1-p$), the parent colony survives.\n\nNatural selection is expected to favor an allocation strategy, $x$, that maximizes the long-term geometric mean fitness of the lineage. Assume that the parameters $p$, $g$, and $b$ are in a range where the optimal strategy is a mixed strategy, meaning the optimal allocation fraction $x_{opt}$ is strictly between 0 and 1.\n\nDerive a closed-form analytic expression for the optimal fraction of energy to allocate to larval dispersal, $x_{opt}$, in terms of $p$, $g$, and $b$.", "solution": "Let the allocation to dispersal be $x \\in (0,1)$ and the allocation to growth be $1-x$.
