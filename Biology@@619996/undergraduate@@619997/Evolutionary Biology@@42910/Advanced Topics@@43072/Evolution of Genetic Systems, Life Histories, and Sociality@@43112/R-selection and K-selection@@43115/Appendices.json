This exercise provides a classic ecological scenario to help you build intuition.

This environment is characterized by its remarkable stability: water levels, temperature, and resource availability are highly predictable and constant year-round. Due to the stability and isolation, the population of Species A is consistently at or near the pond's carrying capacity, leading to intense intraspecific competition for food and nesting sites.\n\nSpecies B inhabits a large, dynamic river system. This environment is highly variable and unpredictable. It is subject to frequent and severe seasonal floods that scour the riverbed, as well as prolonged droughts that can reduce large sections of the river to stagnant pools. These events cause massive, indiscriminate mortality, meaning an individual's survival is often independent of its traits. Consequently, the population of Species B is frequently well below the river's potential carrying capacity.\n\nBased on the principles of life history theory, which of the following traits would be more likely to evolve and be prominently expressed in Species B compared to Species A? Select all that apply.\n\nA. High fecundity (producing a very large number of small eggs per brood).\n\nB. Early age of first reproduction.\n\nC. Extensive post-hatching parental care, such as nest guarding and feeding of young.\n\nD. A survivorship curve where mortality is highest in the earliest life stages.\n\nE.

Species A persists in a stable, predictable, isolated pond with population size near carrying capacity and intense density-dependent competition. This context favors K-selected traits: delayed reproduction, lower fecundity with larger offspring, extensive parental care, large body size, slow growth, strong competitive ability, and survivorship curves with lower early-life mortality (Type I or II).\n\nSpecies B inhabits a highly variable, unpredictable river with frequent density-independent mortality events that reduce the population well below carrying capacity. This favors r-selected traits: maximizing the intrinsic rate of increase through early reproduction, high fecundity (many small offspring), minimal parental care, rapid maturation and growth to reproductive age, poorer competitive ability, and Type III survivorship (high early-life mortality).\n\nEvaluate each option in light of r- versus K-selection:\n- A. High fecundity (many small eggs): favored under r-selection; more likely in Species B.\n- B. Early age of first reproduction: favored under r-selection; more likely in Species B.\n- C.

This problem introduces a metapopulation model where an r-strategist excels at colonizing new patches, while a K-strategist is a superior competitor within a patch. Your task is to mathematically determine the level of environmental disturbance that allows the superior colonizer to persist, providing a quantitative basis for the competition-colonization tradeoff [@problem_id:1876765].", "problem": "In a large landscape composed of numerous identical habitat patches, two competing species of perennial plants, *Fugax rapidus* and *Perstans fortis*, are studied. *Fugax rapidus* is a classic r-strategist, characterized by a superior colonization ability. *Perstans fortis* is a K-strategist with a lower colonization rate but is a superior competitor.\n\nThe dynamics of patch occupancy can be described by a metapopulation model based on the following principles:\n- The fraction of patches occupied by the r-strategist (*Fugax*) at time $t$ is $p_r(t)$. Its colonization rate parameter is $c_r$.\n- The fraction of patches occupied by the K-strategist (*Perstans*) at time $t$ is $p_K(t)$. Its colonization rate parameter is $c_K$. It is assumed that $c_r > c_K$.\n- Any occupied patch can be cleared by a stochastic disturbance (e.g., fire, landslide), becoming empty. This local extinction event occurs at a constant rate $e$ for both species.\n- The K-strategist, *Perstans fortis*, is the dominant competitor. If it colonizes a patch already occupied by the r-strategist, it will always successfully displace it.\n\nThe system of differential equations describing the change in patch occupancy fractions over time is given by:\n\n1.  For the K-strategist (*Perstans*):\n    $$ \\frac{dp_K}{dt} = c_K p_K (1 - p_K) - e p_K $$\n    This equation reflects that the K-strategist can colonize any patch not already occupied by itself and suffers local extinction.\n\n2.  For the r-strategist (*Fugax*):\n    $$ \\frac{dp_r}{dt} = c_r p_r (1 - p_r - p_K) - e p_r - c_K p_K p_r $$\n    This equation reflects that the r-strategist can only colonize empty patches, suffers local extinction, and is competitively excluded from its patches by incoming K-strategists.\n\nFor the two species to coexist in the metapopulation, the patch extinction rate $e$ must be greater than a certain critical threshold, $e_{\\text{crit}}$. Below this threshold, the superior competitor (*Perstans*) will eventually drive the superior colonizer (*Fugax*) to extinction across the landscape.\n\nAssuming that the parameters are such that coexistence is possible (i.e., $c_r > c_K > e > 0$), derive a closed-form analytic expression for this critical extinction rate, $e_{\\text{crit}}$, in terms of the colonization rates $c_r$ and $c_K$.", "solution": "Coexistence in this competition–colonization metapopulation requires that the r-strategist can increase when rare in the presence of the resident K-strategist at its equilibrium.

This problem explores 'bet-hedging,' a sophisticated strategy for dealing with unpredictable environments often associated with r-selection.

In any given year, the conditions can be classified as either \"Good\" or \"Bad\". A \"Good\" year, which occurs with a constant probability $p$, has sufficient rainfall for plants to mature and reproduce. A \"Bad\" year occurs with probability $1-p$, and has insufficient rainfall, causing all germinated plants to die before setting seed.\n\nTo cope with this uncertainty, the plant has evolved a bet-hedging strategy involving seed dormancy. Each year, a fixed fraction $g$ of the total seeds in the soil's seed bank germinate, while the remaining fraction $1-g$ stays dormant.\n\nLet's model the population dynamics:\n- If a seed germinates in a \"Good\" year, it develops into a plant that produces $S$ new seeds, which enter the seed bank for the following year. We can think of $S$ as the reproductive multiplication factor for a successful germination.\n- A seed that remains dormant in the soil has a probability $s_d$ of surviving to the next year.\n- For this model, you may assume that the parameters are such that the optimal germination fraction is strictly between 0 and 1. Specifically, assume $pS > s_d$ and $S > s_d$.\n\nThe long-term success of this strategy is determined by maximizing the geometric mean of the year-to-year growth rate of the seed bank population.
