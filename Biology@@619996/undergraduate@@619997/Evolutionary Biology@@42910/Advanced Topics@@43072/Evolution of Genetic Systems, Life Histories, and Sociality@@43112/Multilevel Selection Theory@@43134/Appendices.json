This first practice uses a clear, step-by-step scenario to demonstrate the theory's central mechanism, a dynamic often related to Simpson's Paradox. By meticulously tracking allele frequencies, you will see how strong selection *between* groups can overwhelm selection *within* groups, leading to an overall increase in cooperation across the entire population.

The voles are organized into a metapopulation consisting of 100 distinct colonies, each with a fixed size of 50 individuals.\n\nWithin this population, a gene controls a key cooperative behavior. The altruistic allele, `H`, causes an individual to engage in a special \"shivering\" behavior that generates communal heat in the burrow, increasing the colony's chance of surviving the winter. This behavior comes at a personal metabolic cost. The selfish allele, `h`, does not confer this behavior, allowing the individual to conserve its energy.\n\nAt the start of the season, the metapopulation is heterogeneous. 50 of the colonies are \"High-H,\" where the initial frequency of the `H` allele is $p_{H, \\text{initial}} = 0.80$. The remaining 50 colonies are \"Low-H,\" with an initial `H` allele frequency of $p_{L, \\text{initial}} = 0.30$.\n\nThe evolutionary dynamics unfold in two stages over a single year:\n\n1.  **Within-Colony Selection:** During the summer and autumn, individuals with the selfish `h` allele have a slight survival and reproductive advantage within every colony because they conserve energy. This leads to a decrease in the frequency of the `H` allele.\n    *   In each of the High-H colonies, the frequency of the `H` allele drops from $0.80$ to an end-of-season frequency of $p'_{H} = 0.75$.\n    *   In each of the Low-H colonies, the frequency of the `H` allele drops from $0.30$ to an end-of-season frequency of $p'_{L} = 0.25$.\n    The size of each colony remains at 50 individuals just before winter.\n\n2.  **Between-Colony Selection:** The harshness of the winter imposes a form of group selection. A colony's survival depends on the total amount of communal heat generated, which is directly related to its frequency of `H` alleles at the end of the season. A colony survives the winter only if its end-of-season allele frequency ($p'$) is greater than or equal to a critical thermal threshold of $0.50$. Any colony with an allele frequency below this threshold perishes entirely.\n\nFollowing the winter, all individuals from the surviving colonies disperse and form a single, randomly mating gene pool that will found the next generation's colonies.\n\nCalculate the net change in the frequency of the altruistic `H` allele in the total metapopulation, from the start of the season to the formation of the new gene pool after winter.

This exercise moves from demonstrating the principle to quantifying it through a classic cost-benefit analysis in a flock of foraging birds.

When a bird discovers a patch of food, it can adopt one of two strategies: 'Silent' or 'Caller'. A Silent bird that finds a food patch consumes it alone. A Caller bird emits a vocalization that attracts its entire flock to share the food.\n\nThe following parameters define the model:\n- $F$: The total energy units available in a single food patch.\n- $F_{max}$: The maximum energy units a single bird can consume from one patch, with $F > F_{max}$. If a Silent bird finds a patch, energy units in excess of $F_{max}$ are left unconsumed.\n- $c$: An energy cost incurred by a Caller for vocalizing.\n- $p$: The probability that any individual bird finds a food patch during a standard foraging expedition.\n- $N$: The number of birds in a flock.\n\nThe fitness of a bird is directly proportional to the net energy it gains. When a Caller finds a patch, the food is divided equally among all $N$ members of the flock. An evolutionary biologist proposes that for a given food patch size $F$ and individual consumption limit $F_{max}$, there exists a critical flock size, $N_{crit}$, that marks the boundary for the evolution of altruistic calling. For flocks smaller than this size ($N  N_{crit}$), the Caller strategy can successfully invade a population of Silent foragers.\n\nAssuming a large population composed of many such flocks, derive an expression for this critical flock size, $N_{crit}$, in terms of $F$, $F_{max}$, and $c$.", "solution": "We compare the expected net energy (fitness) of a rare Caller mutant to that of a resident Silent individual and use the standard invasion condition that a strategy can invade if its expected fitness when rare exceeds that of the resident.\n\nA Silent individual in a flock of Silent foragers only gains when it personally finds a patch.
