A localized region of the chromosome showing a sharp, two-fold increase in read depth coverage compared to the genomic average, suggesting a copy number variation.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the bioinformatic signatures used to detect chromosomal inversion breakpoints from paired-end sequencing data mapped to a reference genome. Let's analyze the expected mapping patterns for reads originating from a chromosome containing an inversion when they are aligned to a standard, non-inverted reference.\n\nLet the standard reference chromosome have segments in the order `...P-Q-R-S-T...`. An inversion of the `Q-R-S` region would result in a chromosome with the structure `...P-S'-R'-Q'-T...`, where the prime (') denotes the reverse complement of the original sequence. Our sequencing reads come from a population containing both types of chromosomes, and all reads are mapped back to the standard `...P-Q-R-S-T...` reference.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Clusters of read pairs with an everted orientation.**\nThis is a key signature of an inversion. Consider a DNA fragment from the inverted chromosome that spans one of the breakpoints, for example, a fragment that covers the junction between `P` and `S'`. A paired-end read from this fragment will have one read originating from the `P` region and the other from the `S'` region. When mapped to the standard reference:\n- The read from region `P` will map normally to `P`. Let's say it maps to the forward strand (`-->`).\n- The read from region `S'` is a reverse-complement of the sequence in the `S` region of the reference. When the alignment software maps this read to the reference, it will find its correct location at `S`, but its orientation will be flipped relative to a normal read from that region. If a normal forward-reverse pair is `--> <--`, this read from `S'` will also appear as a forward read (`-->`).\nThe resulting pair orientation on the reference genome will be everted, such as forward-forward (`--> -->`) or reverse-reverse (`<-- <--`). Such pairs will cluster at the boundaries of the inverted region, as they arise from fragments that span the breakpoints. Therefore, this is a strong and canonical signal for an inversion.\n\n**B. The presence of \"split reads\".**\nThis is another critical signature that pinpoints the exact breakpoint. A \"split read\" is a single sequencing read that crosses an inversion breakpoint. For example, a read might start in the `P` region and end in the `S'` region of the `...P-S'-R'-Q'-T...` chromosome.\nWhen this single read is mapped to the reference genome (`...P-Q-R-S-T...`):\n- The first part of the read will align perfectly to the end of the `P` region.\n- The alignment algorithm will then fail to extend the alignment into the adjacent `Q` region of the reference.\n- A sophisticated aligner will then search for where the rest of the read might map. It will find that the remaining portion of the read aligns perfectly to the start of the `S` region on the reference, but on the opposite strand (because it came from `S'`).\nThis \"split\" alignment of a single read to two distant locations with a change in strand orientation is a definitive sign of a structural rearrangement, and in this specific configuration, it precisely marks an inversion breakpoint.\n\n**C. Apparent insert size much larger than expected.**\nThis pattern occurs when reads from a fragment flank a region that is present in the reference genome but absent in the sequenced sample. For instance, if region `Q` was deleted in the sample (`...P-R-S...`), a read pair from a fragment spanning the `P-R` junction would map to locations `P` and `R` on the reference. The distance between them on the reference would be `(length of P-to-R) = (original fragment size) + (length of deleted region Q)`. This leads to an anomalously large insert size and is the canonical signature of a deletion, not an inversion.\n\n**D. Read depth coverage at ~50% of the average.**\nA halving of read depth coverage indicates a loss of genetic material. In a diploid organism, if a region is deleted on one of the two homologous chromosomes (a heterozygous deletion), the sequencing depth in that region will be approximately half the average. This is a signature for a deletion, not an inversion, which is a balanced rearrangement (no net loss or gain of DNA).\n\n**E. An outward-facing (reverse-forward) orientation.**\nThis signature (`<-- -->`) is characteristic of a tandem duplication. Imagine a reference `...P-Q...` and a sample with a tandem duplication of `P`, resulting in `...P-P-Q...`. A fragment spanning the new `P-P` junction can result in a read pair where the first read maps to the end of the first `P` (in reverse) and the second read maps to the beginning of the second `P` (in forward on the reference), creating an outward-facing pair. This indicates a duplication, not an inversion.\n\n**F. A sharp, two-fold increase in read depth.**\nA two-fold increase in read depth in a diploid organism suggests that the region exists in four copies instead of the usual two (e.g., a homozygous duplication) or three copies instead of two (a heterozygous duplication, leading to a 1.5-fold increase). In either case, increased read depth is a signature of a copy number gain (duplication), not a balanced inversion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the canonical bioinformatic signatures for identifying inversion breakpoints among the given choices are the clustering of everted read pairs (A) and the presence of split reads with inverted orientation (B).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "1967209"}]}
