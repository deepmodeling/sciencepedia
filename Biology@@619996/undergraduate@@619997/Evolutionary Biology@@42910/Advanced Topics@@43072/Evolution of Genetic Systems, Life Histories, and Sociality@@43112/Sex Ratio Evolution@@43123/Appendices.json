Assume equal mating opportunity among individuals of the same sex, no differential viability or fertility after birth beyond the sex-specific production costs, and that maternal investment is the sole limiting resource. Let the cost to produce one son be $c_m$ and the cost to produce one daughter be $c_f$, with costs measured in identical resource units. Each mother has a fixed budget $B$ and can continuously allocate a fraction $x$ of her budget to sons and the remainder $1-x$ to daughters.

Do not include units.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the condition for an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) for the primary sex ratio by number, denoted $p$, and for the computation of this ratio given specific costs for producing males and females. The analysis will be based on the principles of evolutionary game theory.\n\nA mother's evolutionary fitness is proportional to the total number of her grand-offspring. In a diploid, sexually reproducing population, every offspring results from the fusion of one male and one female gamete. Consequently, the total reproductive value of all males in a generation must equal the total reproductive value of all females in that generation. Let $N_m$ be the total number of males and $N_f$ be the total number of females in the population at reproductive age. Let the average reproductive value of a single male be $v_m$ and that of a single female be $v_f$. The equality of total reproductive values implies $N_m v_m = N_f v_f$. From this, we see that the reproductive value of an individual is inversely proportional to the frequency of its sex in the population, which is consistent with fact (i) from the problem statement. Specifically, $v_m \\propto \\frac{1}{N_m}$ and $v_f \\propto \\frac{1}{N_f}$.\n\nThe problem states that a mother has a fixed budget $B$ and allocates a fraction $x$ to sons and $1-x$ to daughters. The cost to produce one son is $c_m$, and the cost to produce one daughter is $c_f$. The number of sons a mother produces is $n_m = \\frac{xB}{c_m}$, and the number of daughters is $n_f = \\frac{(1-x)B}{c_f}$. Her fitness, $W$, is the sum of the reproductive values of her offspring:\n$$W = n_m v_m + n_f v_f = \\left(\\frac{xB}{c_m}\\right)v_m + \\left(\\frac{(1-x)B}{c_f}\\right)v_f$$\nThe values of $v_m$ and $v_f$ are determined by the population-wide sex ratio, which is set by the resident strategy, not the strategy of a single (potentially mutant) mother.\n\nAccording to fact (ii), an ESS is reached when the marginal fitness return per unit of investment is equalized across all possible investment choices. Here, the choices are investing in sons versus investing in daughters. The investment in sons is the budget portion $xB$, and the investment in daughters is $(1-x)B$.\n\nThe marginal fitness return from investing in sons is the derivative of the fitness component from sons, $n_m v_m$, with respect to the investment in sons, $I_m = xB$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial (n_m v_m)}{\\partial I_m} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (xB)} \\left(\\frac{xB}{c_m}v_m\\right) = \\frac{v_m}{c_m}$$\nSimilarly, the marginal fitness return from investing in daughters is the derivative of the fitness component from daughters, $n_f v_f$, with respect to the investment in daughters, $I_f = (1-x)B$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial (n_f v_f)}{\\partial I_f} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial ((1-x)B)} \\left(\\frac{(1-x)B}{c_f}v_f\\right) = \\frac{v_f}{c_f}$$\nAt the ESS, these marginal returns must be equal:\n$$\\frac{v_m}{c_m} = \\frac{v_f}{c_f}$$\nSubstituting the proportionality $v_m \\propto \\frac{1}{N_m}$ and $v_f \\propto \\frac{1}{N_f}$ (where the constant of proportionality is the same for both), we get:\n$$\\frac{1}{c_m N_m} = \\frac{1}{c_f N_f}$$\nThis simplifies to the central condition for an ESS population state, known as Fisher's principle:\n$$c_m N_m = c_f N_f$$\nThis condition states that at the ESS, the total parental investment in sons in the population must equal the total parental investment in daughters.\n\nThe problem asks for a condition on the primary sex ratio by number, $p$. By definition, $p = \\frac{N_m}{N_m + N_f}$, and the proportion of females is $1-p = \\frac{N_f}{N_m + N_f}$. We can express $N_m$ and $N_f$ in terms of $p$ and the total population size $N_{tot} = N_m + N_f$:\n$$N_m = p N_{tot}$$\n$$N_f = (1-p) N_{tot}$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the ESS condition $c_m N_m = c_f N_f$:\n$$c_m (p N_{tot}) = c_f ((1-p) N_{tot})$$\nSince $N_{tot}$ is non-zero, it can be cancelled from both sides, yielding the condition for the resident population primary sex ratio $p$ to be an ESS:\n$$c_m p = c_f (1-p)$$\nThis is the first part of the required derivation.\n\nTo compute the ESS primary sex ratio for the given costs, we solve this equation for $p$:\n$$c_m p = c_f - c_f p$$\n$$c_m p + c_f p = c_f$$\n$$p(c_m + c_f) = c_f$$\n$$p = \\frac{c_f}{c_m + c_f}$$\nThis is the general expression for the ESS primary sex ratio by number.\n\nThe problem provides the specific costs $c_m = 2$ and $c_f = 1$. Substituting these values into the expression for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{1}{2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThis is the ESS primary sex ratio by number. The population should be composed of one-third males and two-thirds females at conception. This result makes intuitive sense: because sons are twice as expensive to produce as daughters, the population stabilizes at a point where there are half as many sons as daughters, thereby equalizing the total parental investment in each sex.

This conceptual problem challenges you to evaluate whether the assumptions for Local Mate Competition (LMC)—a major exception to Fisher's principle—are met in a given biological scenario [@problem_id:1963034]. This practice emphasizes the critical skill of applying theoretical models by examining their underlying assumptions in the context of a real-world life history.", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, the allocation of resources to male versus female offspring is a central question. For large, randomly mating (panmictic) populations, R. A. Fisher's principle predicts that the evolutionarily stable strategy is a 1:1 sex ratio. However, an important exception arises under conditions of Local Mate Competition (LMC), which predicts a female-biased sex ratio. The theory of LMC applies when the following key conditions are met: (1) the population is structured into local patches; (2) mating occurs within these local patches, primarily between siblings or other close relatives; and (3) fertilized females then disperse to found new patches. Under these conditions, a mother who produces fewer sons reduces the wasteful competition among them for mates, thereby increasing her total number of grandchildren.\n\nConsider a hypothetical species of dioecious coral, *Acropora oceanica*, which has separate male and female colonies. These corals are sessile (immobile) as adults and live on reefs. Once a year, all colonies on a reef synchronously reproduce by engaging in broadcast spawning: they release enormous clouds of eggs and sperm into the water column. Fertilization occurs externally in the open ocean. The resulting larvae, known as planulae, are planktonic and drift with ocean currents for several weeks. This larval stage results in dispersal over vast distances, typically hundreds of kilometers, before the larvae settle on a new, distant reef to grow into adult colonies. Consequently, the siblings from a single parental mating are scattered across a vast geographic area.\n\nBased on the life history of *Acropora oceanica*, which of the following best predicts the expected primary sex ratio (i.e., the ratio of male to female zygotes produced) for this species from an evolutionary standpoint?\n\nA. A 1:1 sex ratio, because the population is effectively panmictic due to long-range larval dispersal, violating a key assumption of Local Mate Competition.\n\nB. A female-biased sex ratio, because fertilization occurs in a \"local patch\" of water near the spawning adults, leading to Local Mate Competition.\n\nC. A male-biased sex ratio, to increase the probability that sperm will successfully find and fertilize the sparsely distributed eggs in the vast expanse of the ocean.\n\nD. A female-biased sex ratio, because high mortality during the planktonic larval stage favors producing more of the less 'risky' sex, which are females.\n\nE. The sex ratio will be highly variable and unpredictable, as it is primarily determined by the chaotic and random nature of fertilization success in ocean currents.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the expected evolutionarily stable sex ratio for the broadcast spawning coral, *Acropora oceanica*, by evaluating whether the conditions for Fisher's principle or Local Mate Competition (LMC) are better met.\n\nFirst, let's recall the core assumptions of the two competing theories.\n1.  **Fisher's Principle**: Predicts a 1:1 sex ratio. It assumes a large, randomly mating (panmictic) population where the reproductive value of a son or daughter depends on their frequency in the population. If one sex is rarer, producing that sex yields greater fitness returns, pushing the ratio back to 1:1.\n2.  **Local Mate Competition (LMC)**: Predicts a female-biased sex ratio. Its critical assumption is that brothers compete with each other for mating opportunities with their sisters (or other local females) in a spatially structured population before dispersal.\n\nNext, we must analyze the life cycle of *Acropora oceanica* to see which set of assumptions it fits. The problem describes the following key life-history traits:\n-   Adults are sessile (immobile).\n-   Reproduction is via broadcast spawning, with external fertilization in the open ocean.\n-   Larvae are planktonic and disperse for weeks over hundreds of kilometers.\n-   Siblings from one set of parents are scattered over a very wide area and settle on distant reefs.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conditions for LMC in the context of this life cycle. The LMC model requires that mating occurs in local patches among relatives. In the classic LMC model (e.g., parasitoid wasps), a female lays her eggs on a patch, her offspring hatch, the brothers mate with their sisters, and then the fertilized females disperse.\n\nFor *Acropora oceanica*, the mating event is the fusion of gametes in the water column. While the gametes are released from a geographically local group of adults, they are mixed by ocean currents over a large volume of water. More importantly, the resulting offspring—the larvae—undergo massive dispersal. A larva that settles on a reef and grows into an adult colony will be surrounded by other colonies that originated from parents hundreds of kilometers away. When this new generation of corals reproduces, the sperm from a male colony will be competing with sperm from countless unrelated males to fertilize eggs from countless unrelated females.\n\nThe crucial condition for LMC—competition among brothers for mates—is completely absent. A mother coral's sons (or rather, the male colonies that develop from her male zygotes) will mature on reefs hundreds of kilometers apart from each other and from their sisters. They will never compete with each other for mates.\n\nSince the extensive larval dispersal ensures that the mating population is effectively very large and random (panmictic), the assumptions of LMC are not met. Instead, the assumptions of Fisher's principle are met. In this large, well-mixed population of gametes and larvae, the reproductive success of a male or female offspring depends on the overall sex ratio in the entire breeding population. Therefore, selection will favor parents that invest equally in male and female offspring, leading to an evolutionarily stable strategy of a 1:1 sex ratio.\n\nLet's review the options:\n-   **A**: This option correctly identifies that long-range larval dispersal leads to a panmictic population structure, which violates the assumptions of LMC and thus leads to a 1:1 sex ratio as predicted by Fisher's principle. This aligns with our analysis.\n-   **B**: This option incorrectly identifies the water column as a \"local patch\" in the LMC sense. It ignores the critical consequence of larval dispersal, which breaks any local structure before the next generation mates.\n-   **C**: This option proposes a male-biased ratio. While sperm competition is intense, there is no standard evolutionary theory suggesting a male-biased *primary* sex ratio is a stable strategy in this context. Fisher's logic still holds: total male reproductive success must equal total female reproductive success.\n-   **D**: This option suggests a female bias for reasons unrelated to LMC (differential risk). While parental investment strategies can be complex, this is not the standard explanation and does not directly address the core of the LMC vs. Fisher framework.\n-   **E**: This option suggests unpredictability. While there is randomness in individual survival and fertilization, evolutionary theory predicts stable strategies that emerge as statistical averages over many individuals and generations. The sex ratio is a classic example of a trait with a predictable evolutionary equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is a 1:1 sex ratio because the conditions for LMC are not met.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1963034"}]}
