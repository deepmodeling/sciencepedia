[@problem_id:1925328]", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, the \"two-fold cost of sex\" refers to the relative disadvantage of sexual reproduction compared to asexual reproduction. In the classic model, an asexual lineage composed entirely of females grows twice as fast as a sexual lineage where half the individuals are non-egg-laying males. This model, however, assumes males contribute nothing to offspring survival.\n\nConsider a hypothetical animal species where we can compare an asexual (parthenogenetic) lineage and a sexual lineage.\n1. In the asexual lineage, females are the only sex. A single mother provides all parental care. The probability of an offspring surviving from birth to reproductive maturity under this maternal-only care is $P_A$.\n2. In the sexual lineage, the population maintains a 1:1 sex ratio. Males in this lineage provide extensive parental care alongside the females. This biparental care is so effective that the probability of an offspring surviving from birth to reproductive maturity is $P_S$.\n\nIn all other respects, the lineages are identical: females in both populations produce the same number of eggs per clutch, and the resource costs of producing an individual egg are the same.\n\nIf the survival probability with maternal care alone is $P_A = 0.55$ and the survival probability with biparental care is $P_S = 0.95$, calculate the effective reproductive cost for the sexual lineage. This cost is defined as the ratio of the asexual lineage's per-capita growth rate to the sexual lineage's per-capita growth rate.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $E$ be the number of eggs produced per female per reproductive episode (identical in both lineages).\n\nAsexual lineage:\n- All adults are females, and only mothers provide care.\n- The expected number of offspring reaching reproductive maturity per adult (per-capita growth rate) is\n$$\nr_{A} = E P_{A}.\n$$\n\nSexual lineage:\n- The sex ratio is $1:1$, so in a population of $N$ adults, there are $N/2$ females.\n- Each female produces $E$ eggs and biparental care yields survival probability $P_{S}$.\n- The total number of offspring reaching maturity is $(N/2) E P_{S}$, so the per-capita growth rate is\n$$\nr_{S} = \\frac{(N/2) E P_{S}}{N} = \\frac{1}{2} E P_{S}.\n$$\n\nThe effective reproductive cost of sex, defined as the ratio of asexual to sexual per-capita growth, is\n$$\nC \\equiv \\frac{r_{A}}{r_{S}} = \\frac{E P_{A}}{(1/2) E P_{S}} = \\frac{2 P_{A}}{P_{S}}.\n$$\nSubstituting $P_{A} = 0.55$ and $P_{S} = 0.95$,\n$$\nC = \\frac{2 \\times 0.55}{0.95} = \\frac{1.10}{0.95} \\approx 1.157894\\ldots\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $1.16$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.16}$$", "id": "1925328"}, {"introduction": "If sex has costs, it must also have profound benefits, chief among them the creation of new genetic combinations through recombination. This practice problem illustrates the Hill-Robertson effect, a classic scenario where a new beneficial mutation is unfortunately linked to a pre-existing deleterious one. Your task is to reason through how recombination can \"rescue\" the beneficial allele, allowing natural selection to act more efficiently by separating advantageous traits from their baggage. [@problem_id:1925374]", "problem": "Consider a large population of a vegetatively haploid fungus that primarily reproduces asexually. The wild-type population is sensitive to a newly introduced antifungal agent. Within this population, a single, strongly beneficial point mutation, allele $R$, arises at the `resistance` locus, conferring complete resistance to the agent. By chance, this mutation occurs on a chromosome that also carries a distinct, pre-existing, weakly deleterious mutation, allele $d$, at the `dubious` locus. The `dubious` locus is physically close to the `resistance` locus on the same chromosome. The original, non-deleterious allele at this locus is $D$. Therefore, the first resistant individual has the haplotype $Rd$.\n\nThe vast majority of the fungal population has the wild-type haplotype $rD$ (sensitive to the agent, no deleterious $d$ allele). While primarily asexual, this fungal species can engage in a rare sexual cycle where two haploid individuals fuse to form a transient diploid cell, which then immediately undergoes meiosis to produce new haploid spores. This process allows for genetic recombination between homologous chromosomes.\n\nIn the presence of the antifungal agent, which of the following statements best describes the primary advantage that genetic recombination provides for the spread of the beneficial $R$ allele in this specific scenario?\n\nA. Recombination increases the overall mutation rate, generating new beneficial alleles faster than asexual reproduction.\n\nB. Recombination allows the population to purge the deleterious $d$ allele by creating homozygous $dd$ diploid individuals that are quickly eliminated by selection.\n\nC. Recombination allows for the creation of a new $RD$ haplotype, which has a higher fitness than the original $Rd$ haplotype and can therefore spread more rapidly through the population.\n\nD. Recombination allows the deleterious effects of the $d$ allele to be masked by the $D$ allele in the transient diploid state, preventing the $R$ allele from being eliminated.\n\nE.
