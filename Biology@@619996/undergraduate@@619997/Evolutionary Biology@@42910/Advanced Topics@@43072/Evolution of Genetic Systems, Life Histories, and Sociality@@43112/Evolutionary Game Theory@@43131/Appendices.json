By analyzing this scenario, you will practice the fundamental skill of calculating an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS), discovering how frequency-dependent payoffs can lead to the stable coexistence of competing strategies.", "problem": "In a large, well-mixed population of yeast cells, individuals compete for packets of a limiting resource. There are two genetically determined behavioral strategies observed in the population: 'Cooperator' and 'Defector'. When two individuals encounter a resource packet, their interaction and payoffs, measured in units of fitness, are determined by their strategies. The resource packet has a nutritional value of $V$.\n\nThe rules of interaction are as follows:\n- If two Cooperators meet, they share the resource equally without any conflict.\n- If a Cooperator meets a Defector, the Cooperator yields the entire resource to the Defector without a fight.\n- If two Defectors meet, they engage in a costly metabolic conflict over the resource. The conflict is symmetrical, where each has an equal chance of winning the entire resource packet. The loser gets nothing. The expected payoff to each Defector from such an encounter is given by $\\frac{V-C}{2}$, where $C$ is the metabolic cost associated with the conflict.\n\nYou are given that the metabolic cost of conflict is greater than the value of the resource, i.e., $C > V > 0$.\n\nAssuming this system reaches an evolutionarily stable state, determine the equilibrium frequency of Cooperators in the population.

This problem [@problem_id:1927008] examines the evolution of cannibalism, a seemingly purely selfish act, but with a twistâ€”the potential victims might be your relatives. You will apply Hamilton's rule to the payoffs from a simple game, allowing you to determine the conditions under which kin selection can prevent or promote the spread of a harmful social behavior.", "problem": "In certain species of larval amphibians that develop in ephemeral ponds, food scarcity can lead to cannibalism. We can model the evolution of this behavior using game theory. Consider a large population of larvae where two distinct, genetically determined foraging strategies exist: 'Cannibal' and 'Peaceful'.\n\nAn individual's success depends on its own strategy and the strategy of the larva it interacts with. We can define the fitness payoffs relative to a baseline of zero, which represents the fitness of a 'Peaceful' forager interacting with another 'Peaceful' forager. The interactions are defined as follows:\n\n-   When a 'Peaceful' larva interacts with another 'Peaceful' larva, their interaction payoff is 0.\n-   When a 'Cannibal' larva interacts with a 'Peaceful' larva, the 'Cannibal' gains a fitness benefit $b$ from the meal, and the 'Peaceful' larva is consumed, incurring a fitness cost $c$. Thus, the 'Cannibal' has a payoff of $b$ and the 'Peaceful' has a payoff of $-c$.\n-   When two 'Cannibal' larvae interact, they fight. Each has a 50% chance of winning (and consuming the other) and a 50% chance of losing (and being consumed). The expected payoff for each 'Cannibal' in such an encounter is $\\frac{b-c}{2}$.\n\nAssume that larvae in a pond are related, and the average coefficient of relatedness between two randomly interacting individuals is $r$. A rare 'Cannibal' allele arises via mutation in a population composed entirely of 'Peaceful' foragers. For this 'Cannibal' strategy to be favored by kin selection and increase in frequency, the ratio of the benefit to the cost, $\\frac{b}{c}$, must exceed a critical threshold.\n\nDetermine this critical threshold for the ratio $\\frac{b}{c}$. Your answer should be an expression in terms of the parameters given.", "solution": "We apply kin selection using Hamilton's rule. For a rare mutant, almost all its interactions are with residents using the 'Peaceful' strategy, so we compare the inclusive fitness of a 'Cannibal' acting against a 'Peaceful' relative to the baseline 'Peaceful'-'Peaceful' interaction, which has payoff zero to both.\n\nLet the actor be the 'Cannibal' and the recipient be the 'Peaceful' opponent. The direct effect on the actor's fitness relative to baseline is a gain of $b$. The effect on the recipient's fitness is a loss of $c$. With relatedness $r$ between actor and recipient, the inclusive fitness change caused by the act is\n$$\n\\Delta W = b + r(-c) = b - r c.\n$$\nBy Hamilton's rule, the mutant 'Cannibal' strategy is favored and increases when $\\Delta W > 0$, i.e.,\n$$\nb - r c > 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{b}{c} > r.\n$$\nTherefore, the critical threshold for $\\frac{b}{c}$ is $r$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{r}$$", "id": "1927008"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem synthesizes game theory with population genetics to model a more sophisticated social system. Here, behavior is not just a strategy but an expressed trait determined by diploid genetics, giving rise to Hawks, Doves, and conditional Assessors [@problem_id:1926979]. Your task is to connect the game's payoffs to allele frequencies and find the specific conditions that maintain genetic diversity, offering a deeper understanding of how complex behavioral polymorphisms can be sustained in natural populations.", "problem": "In a large, randomly mating diploid population, the strategy employed by an individual in pairwise resource contests is determined by a single genetic locus with two alleles, $A_H$ and $A_D$. The population is assumed to be in Hardy-Weinberg proportions at the beginning of each generation. The three possible genotypes map to three distinct behavioral strategies:\n-   Individuals with genotype $A_H A_H$ adopt the 'Hawk' strategy, always escalating to a fight.\n-   Individuals with genotype $A_D A_D$ adopt the 'Dove' strategy, never escalating.\n-   Heterozygous individuals ($A_H A_D$) adopt the 'Assessor' strategy.\n\nContests are over a resource of value $V$. Fights between two Hawks result in one individual winning the resource and the other incurring an injury of cost $C > V$; the average payoff for a Hawk meeting a Hawk is thus $(V-C)/2$. When a Dove meets a Dove, they share the resource, each receiving a payoff of $V/2$. In any mixed contest between a Hawk and a Dove, the Dove immediately retreats, receiving a payoff of 0, while the Hawk gets the full resource $V$.\n\nAssessors behave conditionally. When an Assessor meets a Dove, it acts like a Hawk, securing the resource $V$. When an Assessor meets a Hawk, it recognizes the danger and retreats, receiving a payoff of 0. When two Assessors meet, they engage in a harmless display of cost $d$ to settle the contest, after which one retreats and the other takes the resource; the average payoff is thus $V/2 - d$.\n\nThe fitness of each genotype is determined by a baseline fitness component plus the average payoff from these contests. The population can settle into a stable polymorphic equilibrium where both alleles, $A_H$ and $A_D$, are maintained. The proportion of heterozygous Assessor individuals in the population is maximized at a specific frequency of the $A_H$ allele.\n\nAssuming the display cost $d$ is negligible ($d=0$), determine the exact value of the ratio $C/V$ that would cause the stable polymorphic equilibrium of the system to occur precisely at the allele frequency that maximizes the proportion of Assessors in the population.", "solution": "Let $p$ be the frequency of the allele $A_H$ and $q=1-p$ be the frequency of the allele $A_D$. Under the assumption of random mating and Hardy-Weinberg proportions, the frequencies of the three genotypes, which correspond to the frequencies of the three strategies, are:\n-   Frequency of Hawk ($x_H$): $p^2$\n-   Frequency of Assessor ($x_A$): $2pq = 2p(1-p)$\n-   Frequency of Dove ($x_D$): $q^2 = (1-p)^2$\n\nThe problem asks for a condition related to the maximization of the Assessor frequency. The frequency of Assessors is given by $f(p) = 2p(1-p) = 2p - 2p^2$. To find the maximum, we take the derivative with respect to $p$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{df}{dp} = 2 - 4p = 0 \\implies p = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThus, the proportion of Assessors in the population is maximized when the allele frequencies are $p=q=0.5$. The problem therefore asks for the value of $C/V$ that results in a stable equilibrium at $p=0.5$.\n\nNext, we establish the fitness of each strategy. The fitness of an individual playing a certain strategy is its average payoff from encounters with all possible opponents in the population. Let $E_H, E_A, E_D$ be the average payoffs for the Hawk, Assessor, and Dove strategies, respectively.\n\nThe payoffs for a focal individual playing strategy $S_i$ against an opponent playing strategy $S_j$ is given by the payoff matrix:\n-   Hawk (vs. H, A, D): $(\\frac{V-C}{2}, V, V)$\n-   Assessor (vs. H, A, D): $(0, \\frac{V}{2}-d, V)$\n-   Dove (vs. H, A, D): $(0, 0, \\frac{V}{2})$\n\nThe average payoff for each strategy is the weighted average of its payoffs against all opponents, with weights given by the opponent frequencies. With $d=0$:\n$$ E_H = x_H \\left(\\frac{V-C}{2}\\right) + x_A V + x_D V = p^2 \\left(\\frac{V-C}{2}\\right) + 2p(1-p)V + (1-p)^2 V $$\n$$ E_A = x_H (0) + x_A \\left(\\frac{V}{2}\\right) + x_D V = 2p(1-p)\\frac{V}{2} + (1-p)^2 V $$\n$$ E_D = x_H (0) + x_A (0) + x_D \\left(\\frac{V}{2}\\right) = (1-p)^2 \\frac{V}{2} $$\n\nThe fitness of each genotype is taken to be proportional to the payoff of the strategy it expresses. Let $W_{HH}$, $W_{AD}$, $W_{DD}$ be the fitnesses of the genotypes $A_H A_H$, $A_H A_D$, and $A_D A_D$. We have $W_{HH} \\propto E_H$, $W_{AD} \\propto E_A$, and $W_{DD} \\propto E_D$. We can set the baseline fitness to zero without loss of generality, so $W_{HH} = E_H$, $W_{AD} = E_A$, and $W_{DD} = E_D$.\n\nA polymorphic equilibrium ($0 < p < 1$) occurs when the marginal fitnesses of the two alleles, $W_{A_H}$ and $W_{A_D}$, are equal.\nThe marginal fitness of an allele is the average fitness of the genotypes it is found in, weighted by their frequencies among carriers of that allele.\n$$ W_{A_H} = p W_{HH} + q W_{AD} $$\n$$ W_{A_D} = p W_{AD} + q W_{DD} $$\nThe equilibrium condition $W_{A_H} = W_{A_D}$ becomes:\n$$ p W_{HH} + q W_{AD} = p W_{AD} + q W_{DD} $$\n$$ p E_H + (1-p) E_A = p E_A + (1-p) E_D $$\nWe are looking for the condition that places this equilibrium at $p=0.5$. Substituting $p=0.5$ (and thus $q=1-p=0.5$) into the equilibrium equation:\n$$ 0.5 E_H + 0.5 E_A = 0.5 E_A + 0.5 E_D $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ E_H = E_D $$\nThis critical insight means that for an equilibrium to exist at $p=0.5$, the fitness of a Hawk must equal the fitness of a Dove in a population where $p=0.5$.\n\nNow, we evaluate $E_H$ and $E_D$ at $p=0.5$.\nAt $p=0.5$, the strategy frequencies are:\n-   $x_H = p^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n-   $x_A = 2p(1-p) = 2(0.5)(0.5) = 0.5$\n-   $x_D = (1-p)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n\nThe average payoff for a Hawk at this point is:\n$$ E_H(p=0.5) = (0.25)\\left(\\frac{V-C}{2}\\right) + (0.5)V + (0.25)V = \\frac{V-C}{8} + 0.75V = \\frac{V-C+6V}{8} = \\frac{7V-C}{8} $$\nThe average payoff for a Dove at this point is:\n$$ E_D(p=0.5) = (0.25)(0) + (0.5)(0) + (0.25)\\left(\\frac{V}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V}{8} $$\nSetting $E_H(p=0.5) = E_D(p=0.5)$:\n$$ \\frac{7V-C}{8} = \\frac{V}{8} $$\n$$ 7V - C = V $$\n$$ 6V = C $$\nDividing by $V$ gives the required ratio:\n$$ \\frac{C}{V} = 6 $$\nThis equilibrium is stable. We can verify this by checking the invasion conditions at the boundaries. If $C=6V$, then $C>V$. In a pure Hawk population ($p=1$), the payoff to a mutant Assessor is $E_A(p=1)=0$, while the payoff to a resident Hawk is $E_H(p=1)=(V-C)/2 = (V-6V)/2 = -5V/2 < 0$. So $E_A>E_H$, and the $A_D$ allele invades. In a pure Dove population ($p=0$), the payoff to a mutant Assessor is $E_A(p=0)=V$, while the payoff to a resident Dove is $E_D(p=0)=V/2$. Since $E_A>E_D$, the $A_H$ allele invades. Since both boundary equilibria are unstable, the system must converge to the internal equilibrium at $p=0.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "1926979"}]}
