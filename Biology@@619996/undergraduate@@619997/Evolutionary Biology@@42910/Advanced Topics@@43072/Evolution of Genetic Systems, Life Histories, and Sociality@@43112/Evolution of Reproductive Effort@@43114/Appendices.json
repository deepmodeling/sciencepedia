These plants divert some resources to survival, allowing them to endure a harsh dry season. This diversion reduces their first-year reproductive output to $F_{I1} = 50$ offspring. However, it gives them a probability $P_{surv} = 0.40$ of surviving to reproduce a second time in the following year. After this potential second reproductive event, the plant dies.\n\nAssuming that natural selection will favor the strategy with the higher expected lifetime reproductive success, what is the minimum integer number of offspring, $F_{I2}$, that an iteroparous plant must produce in its second year for this strategy to be evolutionarily advantageous over the semelparous strategy?", "solution": "Let the expected lifetime reproductive success (ELRS) of the semelparous strategy be $L_{S}$ and that of the iteroparous strategy be $L_{I}$.\n\nBy definition, the semelparous plant produces all its surviving offspring in a single event:\n$$\nL_{S} = F_{S}.\n$$\nGiven $F_{S} = 100$, we have\n$$\nL_{S} = 100.\n$$\n\nFor the iteroparous plant, it produces $F_{I1}$ offspring in the first year and, with probability $P_{\\text{surv}}$, it survives to produce $F_{I2}$ offspring in the second year.

The plant reproduces in its first year and potentially again in its second and final year. The fitness of an individual plant is assumed to be maximized by maximizing its total expected lifetime seed production.\n\nThe number of seeds produced in the first year, $B_1$, is a function of the reproductive effort, $E_1$, that the plant allocates. This relationship is described by $B_1(E_1) = k \\sqrt{E_1}$, where $k$ is a fecundity constant and $E_1$ is the fraction of the plant's resources devoted to reproduction, with $0 \\le E_1 \\le 1$.\n\nThe trade-off for this effort is a reduced probability of surviving to the second year. The survival probability, $S(E_1)$, is given by the function $S(E_1) = 1 - E_1$.\n\nIf a plant survives to its second year, it produces a fixed number of seeds, $B_2$, independent of its first-year effort. In a healthy population, the parameters are measured to be $k = 120$ (seeds/effort$^{1/2}$) and $B_2 = 80$ seeds.\n\nA new, non-lethal fungal blight begins to infect the population. The blight does not affect first-year plants but infects any plant that survives its first reproductive season. The infection reduces the plant's second-year seed production by 75%.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the optimal first-year reproductive effort in the infected population to that in the healthy population, i.e., find the value of $\\frac{E_{1, \\text{infected}}^*}{E_{1, \\text{healthy}}^*}$.

The optimal effort is the one that maximizes the plant's Lifetime Reproductive Success (LRS), which is the total expected number of seeds produced over its two-year lifespan.\n\nThe general formula for LRS is the sum of the seeds produced in the first year and the expected seeds produced in the second year. The expected second-year production is the probability of surviving to the second year multiplied by the number of seeds produced in that year.\n$$LRS(E_1) = B_1(E_1) + S(E_1) \\cdot B_2$$\n\nWe are given the functions for first-year fecundity and survival:\n$B_1(E_1) = k \\sqrt{E_1}$\n$S(E_1) = 1 - E_1$\n\nSo, the general LRS function is:\n$$LRS(E_1) = k \\sqrt{E_1} + (1 - E_1) B_2$$\n\nTo find the optimal effort $E_1^*$ that maximizes LRS, we need to find the derivative of $LRS(E_1)$ with respect to $E_1$ and set it to zero.

However, reproductive effort $E_1$ is defined as a fraction of resources and is constrained to the interval $[0, 1]$. An optimal value of 9 is not physically possible.\n\nWhen the calculated optimum lies outside the allowed domain, we must check the behavior of the LRS function at the boundaries of the domain. Let's examine the derivative of the LRS for the infected case on the interval $[0, 1]$:\n$$\\frac{d(LRS_{\\text{infected}})}{dE_1} = \\frac{k}{2\\sqrt{E_1}} - B_{2, \\text{infected}} = \\frac{120}{2\\sqrt{E_1}} - 20 = \\frac{60}{\\sqrt{E_1}} - 20$$\nFor any $E_1$ in the domain $(0, 1]$, we have $0 < \\sqrt{E_1} \\le 1$. This means $\\frac{60}{\\sqrt{E_1}} \\ge 60$.\nTherefore, the derivative $\\frac{d(LRS_{\\text{infected}})}{dE_1} = \\frac{60}{\\sqrt{E_1}} - 20 \\ge 60 - 20 = 40$.\nSince the derivative is always positive on the interval $(0, 1]$, the LRS function is strictly increasing with $E_1$ across its entire valid domain. The maximum value of LRS must therefore occur at the highest possible value of $E_1$, which is the boundary value $E_1 = 1$.\nThus, the optimal strategy for an infected plant is to allocate all resources to first-year reproduction.\n$$E_{1, \\text{infected}}^* = 1$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio.**\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{E_{1, \\text{infected}}^*}{E_{1, \\text{healthy}}^*}$.\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{1}{9/16} = \\frac{16}{9}$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $1.7777...$.\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $1.78$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.78}$$", "id": "1925136"}]}
