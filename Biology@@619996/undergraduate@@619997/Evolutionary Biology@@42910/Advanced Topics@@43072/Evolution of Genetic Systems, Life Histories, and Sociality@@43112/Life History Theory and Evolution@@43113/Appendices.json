In their native rural habitat, individuals face a constant annual survival probability. A group of these lizards colonizes a nearby urban park, where they experience higher extrinsic mortality due to factors like increased predation from domestic cats and road traffic.\n\nBiologists model a key component of lifetime reproductive success by considering the trade-off between surviving to a certain age and the fecundity at that age. Let a lizard's first reproductive event occur at age $a$, measured in years. The probability of an individual surviving from birth to age $a$ is given by $l_a = P_S^a$, where $P_S$ is the constant annual survival probability. The fecundity (number of offspring produced) at age $a$ is found to be directly proportional to the lizard's age, such that $m_a = k \\cdot a$, where $k$ is a positive constant representing the combined effects of growth and energy allocation to reproduction.

This plant has a maximum lifespan of two years. Upon reaching maturity at the beginning of its first year, it has accumulated a total energy reserve of $E$.

If $E$ is less than $E^*$, it should wait until Year 2.\n\nAssuming that $G > K_m$, find a symbolic expression for this critical energy threshold $E^*$ in terms of the parameters $G$, $K_m$, and $\\eta$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the critical energy threshold, $E^*$, where the decision to reproduce now versus waiting yields the same expected reproductive success. The plant's strategy is to maximize its expected number of seeds. We will find $E^*$ by setting the expected number of seeds from reproducing in Year 1 equal to the expected number of seeds from waiting until Year 2.\n\nFirst, let's define the expected number of seeds for each strategy as a function of the initial energy, $E$.\n\nLet $W_1(E)$ be the expected number of seeds if the plant reproduces in Year 1. Since this action is certain to occur and results in the plant's death, the number of seeds is simply its reproductive output.\n$$W_1(E) = N_1 = \\beta E$$\n\nNext, let $W_2(E)$ be the expected number of seeds if the plant waits for Year 2. This outcome is probabilistic. The plant must first survive the dry season, which occurs with probability $p_s(E)$. If it survives, it will then produce $N_2$ seeds. If it does not survive, it produces zero seeds. Therefore, the expected number of seeds is the probability of survival multiplied by the reproductive output in Year 2.\n$$W_2(E) = p_s(E) \\times N_2$$\n\nWe are given the expressions for $p_s(E)$ and $N_2$.\nThe probability of survival is $p_s(E) = \\frac{E}{K_m + E}$.\nThe number of seeds in Year 2, given survival, is $N_2 = \\beta E_2 = \\beta(\\eta E + G)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $W_2(E)$:\n$$W_2(E) = \\left( \\frac{E}{K_m + E} \\right) \\cdot \\beta(\\eta E + G)$$\n\nThe critical energy threshold $E^*$ is the value of $E$ at which the two strategies yield equal expected outcomes. Thus, we set $W_1(E^*) = W_2(E^*)$.\n$$\\beta E^* = \\left( \\frac{E^*}{K_m + E^*} \\right) \\cdot \\beta(\\eta E^* + G)$$\n\nWe can solve this equation for $E^*$. The problem implies a non-trivial threshold, so we can assume $E^* > 0$. Also, $\\beta$ is a positive proportionality constant. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by $\\beta E^*$.\n$$1 = \\frac{\\eta E^* + G}{K_m + E^*}$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $E^*$. Multiply both sides by $(K_m + E^*)$:\n$$K_m + E^* = \\eta E^* + G$$\n\nNext, we group the terms with $E^*$ on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other.\n$$E^* - \\eta E^* = G - K_m$$\n\nFactor out $E^*$ from the left-hand side:\n$$E^*(1 - \\eta) = G - K_m$$\n\nFinally, we isolate $E^*$ by dividing by $(1 - \\eta)$. We know $0 < \\eta < 1$, so $(1 - \\eta)$ is a non-zero positive number.\n$$E^* = \\frac{G - K_m}{1 - \\eta}$$\n\nThis is the symbolic expression for the critical energy threshold. The problem states that $G > K_m$, which ensures that the numerator is positive, and thus $E^* > 0$, which is physically sensible. The logic for the decision rule is that if $E > E^*$, then $E(1-\\eta) > G-K_m$, which implies $K_m+E > \\eta E + G$. This leads to $\\beta E > \\frac{\\beta E}{K_m+E}(\\eta E+G)$, meaning $W_1(E) > W_2(E)$, so the plant should reproduce now.
