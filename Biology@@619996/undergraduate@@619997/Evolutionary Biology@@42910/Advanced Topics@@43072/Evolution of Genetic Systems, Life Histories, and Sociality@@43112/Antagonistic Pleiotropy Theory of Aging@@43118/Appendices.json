This first practice invites you to explore a core prediction of the theory through a classic thought experiment involving artificial selection [@problem_id:1974531]. By considering a hypothetical scenario where only late-reproducing individuals contribute to the next generation, you can build intuition for how the strength of natural selection changes over an organism's lifespan and, consequently, how traits like longevity can evolve.", "problem": "One of the central puzzles in evolutionary biology is the existence of aging, or senescence, which is the progressive decline in an organism's physiological function with age, leading to decreased fertility and an increased probability of death. The Antagonistic Pleiotropy (AP) hypothesis is a leading evolutionary explanation for aging. This hypothesis posits that certain genes have pleiotropic effects, meaning they influence multiple, seemingly unrelated traits. Specifically, an allele (a variant of a gene) could be \"antagonistic\" by conferring a fitness benefit early in life (e.g., enhancing reproductive success) while simultaneously causing a fitness cost later in life (e.g., promoting tissue degradation). Natural selection would favor such an allele if its early-life advantage outweighs its late-life disadvantage, as selection acts more strongly on traits expressed before and during the peak reproductive period.\n\nImagine a research team sets up a long-term experiment with a large, genetically diverse population of fruit flies, *Drosophila melanogaster*. In a controlled laboratory environment, they establish a specific artificial selection regime. For each generation, they collect all the eggs laid by the entire population, but they only use the eggs laid by the oldest 10% of surviving female flies to establish the subsequent generation. This protocol is repeated for hundreds of generations. A separate control population is maintained under identical conditions but is allowed to reproduce randomly at a young adult age.\n\nBased *strictly* on the logic of the Antagonistic Pleiotropy hypothesis provided, what is the most likely long-term evolutionary consequence for the average lifespan of the experimentally selected population when compared to the control population?\n\nA. The average lifespan will increase.\n\nB. The average lifespan will decrease.\n\nC. The average lifespan will not change, although the flies will become more fertile at older ages.\n\nD. The population will eventually go extinct due to the intense selection pressure against early-life reproduction.\n\nE. The average lifespan will remain unchanged, as will late-life fertility, because lifespan is a physiologically constrained trait not subject to selection.", "solution": "We apply the Antagonistic Pleiotropy (AP) hypothesis exactly as stated: some alleles have an early-life fitness benefit and a late-life fitness cost. Let an allele have an early-life fitness effect of magnitude $b_{E} \\geq 0$ and a late-life fitness cost of magnitude $c_{L} \\geq 0$. The net selection on such an allele depends on how strongly selection weights fitness effects at different ages.\n\nDefine $w_{E}$ as the relative weight that natural selection assigns to early-life effects and $w_{L}$ as the relative weight for late-life effects. The net selection coefficient on the allele can be written as\n$$\ns=b_{E}w_{E}-c_{L}w_{L}.\n$$\nUnder ordinary conditions (the control population reproducing at a young adult age), classical life-history theory and the AP hypothesis imply $w_{E} \\gg w_{L}$, so that alleles with $b_{E}0$ and modest $c_{L}0$ tend to have $s0$ and rise in frequency, promoting earlier reproduction at the expense of late-life maintenance and thus shortening lifespan.\n\nIn the experimental selection regime, only eggs from the oldest fraction of surviving females are used to found the next generation. Let the oldest fraction be $f=\\frac{1}{10}$. This protocol makes reproductive contribution conditional on survival to late age, which drastically reduces the effective weight of early-life fitness to near zero for transmission to the next generation while elevating the relative weight on late-life performance. Symbolically, relative to the control, this transforms the weighting such that\n$$\nw_{E,\\text{exp}} \\ll w_{L,\\text{exp}}, \\quad \\text{with } w_{E,\\text{exp}} \\approx 0 \\text{ for transmission purposes},\n$$\nso an allele characterized by AP with early benefit and late cost now experiences net selection approximately\n$$\ns_{\\text{exp}} \\approx -c_{L}w_{L,\\text{exp}}  0,\n$$\nand is therefore disfavored. Conversely, alleles that improve late-life survival and/or reproduction but impose an early-life cost (let such an allele have late-life benefit $b_{L}0$ and early-life cost $c_{E}0$) now have\n$$\ns_{\\text{exp}} \\approx b_{L}w_{L,\\text{exp}}-c_{E}w_{E,\\text{exp}} \\approx b_{L}w_{L,\\text{exp}}  0,\n$$\nand are therefore favored.\n\nBy the AP logic, shifting reproductive contribution to late ages selects for delayed senescence mechanisms that enhance late-life function, including increased maintenance and repair that extend survival. Because only individuals that survive to old age reproduce, alleles that extend lifespan are directly favored; alleles that cause late-life deterioration are purged. Over many generations, the average lifespan in the experimentally selected population will therefore increase relative to the control population, in which early reproduction keeps selection focused on early-life benefits despite late-life costs.\n\nThis outcome does not imply extinction (there is no selection against reproduction per se; reproduction is simply delayed in terms of genetic contribution), nor does it imply no change in lifespan: selection now targets late-life performance, which by AP necessarily trades off with early-life performance and thus is evolvable. Hence, the most likely long-term consequence is an increased average lifespan in the selected population compared to the control.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1974531"}, {"introduction": "To truly grasp the dynamics of antagonistic pleiotropy, we must move from qualitative predictions to quantitative models. This exercise challenges you to do just that by using a foundational model from life-history theory [@problem_id:1908932].

This is because selection acts more strongly on traits expressed at a young age.\n\nConsider a simplified model of an age-structured population where individuals are classified by discrete age classes $x=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. In this population, there is a constant probability of extrinsic mortality, $\\mu$, in any given age interval, such that the probability of an individual surviving from one age class to the next is $p=1-\\mu$, independent of its genotype.\n\nThe wild-type individuals in this population reproduce at two specific ages: age 1 and a later age $j$. Their fecundity (average number of offspring produced) at age 1 is $B_1$, and at age $j$ is $B_j$. At all other ages, their fecundity is zero.\n\nA new mutant allele arises in the population.

The fecundity at age $j$ remains unchanged.\n2.  **Late-life cost:** It negatively impacts survival, but only later in life. Specifically, for any age $x \\ge k$, the probability of surviving to the next age class is halved compared to the wild-type. The survival probability at ages $x  k$ is unaffected.\n\nAssume that the late-life effects occur after the first reproductive event but before the second, i.e., $1  k  j$.

This allele is contrasted with the wild-type allele `A`. According to the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis, this allele presents a trade-off between early-life reproductive success and late-life viability.\n\nTo model this, we simplify the organism's life history into two distinct reproductive stages: \"young\" and \"old\". Let $p_y$ be the fraction of an individual's total lifetime reproductive opportunities that occur during the young stage, with the remaining fraction, $1 - p_y$, occurring during the old stage.\n\nThe effects of allele `a` are observed only in males and are as follows:\n1.  **Early-Life Benefit**: In the intense sperm competition characteristic of this species' mating system, young males carrying the `a` allele exhibit enhanced sperm motility. This provides them a competitive advantage, increasing their fertilization success by a factor of $(1 + c)$ relative to wild-type `A` carriers, where $c$ is a positive dimensionless constant representing the competitive boost.\n2.  **Late-Life Cost**: The same metabolic pathway that boosts sperm motility also leads to an accumulation of oxidative damage in the germline over time. Consequently, the offspring of old males carrying the `a` allele have reduced viability. Their effective reproductive output is reduced by a factor of $(1 - d)$ relative to wild-type `A` carriers, where $d$ is a positive dimensionless constant ($0  d  1$).\n\nAssume the `a` allele is rare in the population. The condition for this allele to be favored by natural selection and increase in frequency is that the lifetime reproductive success of a heterozygous individual (`Aa`) is greater than that of a wild-type homozygous individual (`AA`).\n\nDetermine the critical minimum value of $p_y$ for which the pleiotropic allele `a` will be favored by selection.
