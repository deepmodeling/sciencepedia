A geneticist discovers a selfish genetic element on a variant Y chromosome, denoted $Y_d$. This element acts as a segregation distorter. In males possessing the $Y_d$ chromosome ($XY_d$ genotype), a fraction $k$ of their X-bearing sperm are rendered non-functional prior to fertilization. The $Y_d$-bearing sperm are unaffected.\n\nAssume the population begins with a very small fraction of $XY_d$ males, while the rest are wild-type $XY$ males. All females are XX. The population is large, mating is random, and there are no other fitness advantages or disadvantages associated with the $Y_d$ chromosome itself.

This problem introduces the critical concept that the propagation of a selfish element, like a parasitic B chromosome, is often limited by the harm it inflicts on its host. Working through this model [@problem_id:1962282], where drive and fitness costs balance to create a stable equilibrium, will help you understand why selfish elements do not always sweep to fixation and how their prevalence is naturally regulated.", "problem": "A hypothetical diploid insect species is host to a parasitic B chromosome. The presence of this B chromosome is not essential for the insect's survival but it can propagate itself through the population via a process known as meiotic drive. The dynamics of this B chromosome are modeled based on the following principles:\n\n1.  **Population Structure**: The population is large, and individuals mate randomly. The number of B chromosomes, $k$, per individual zygote in any given generation follows a Poisson distribution, $P(k) = e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k / k!$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean number of B chromosomes per individual in that generation's zygote population.\n\n2.  **Meiotic Drive**: The B chromosome exhibits meiotic drive, which enhances its transmission to the next generation. A parent with $k$ B chromosomes produces a collection of gametes that, on average, contain a total of $c \\cdot k / 2$ B chromosomes. For this particular B chromosome, the drive coefficient is a constant $c = 19/15$.\n\n3.  **Fitness Cost**: The accumulation of B chromosomes is detrimental. Individuals with three or fewer B chromosomes ($k \\le 3$) have normal fertility (relative fitness = 1). However, individuals with four or more B chromosomes ($k \\ge 4$) are completely sterile (relative fitness = 0) and do not contribute to the next generation.\n\nUnder these conditions, the population is expected to reach a stable, non-zero equilibrium for the B chromosome's prevalence.

By deriving the selective advantage of this resistance allele [@problem_id:1962320], you will gain a deeper appreciation for how host genomes fight back and how these natural conflicts inform the design and potential consequences of modern gene drive technologies.", "problem": "In a large, randomly mating diploid population of insects, a selfish genetic element known as a Homing Endonuclease Gene (HEG) is present. There are three alleles at the relevant locus:\n\n1.  The `S` allele: This is the wild-type, susceptible allele. It contains a specific DNA sequence that is recognized and cut by the endonuclease.\n2.  The `H` allele: This is the HEG allele. It produces an endonuclease that cuts the target sequence on a homologous chromosome carrying the `S` allele. During meiosis in `HS` heterozygotes, the cell's DNA repair machinery uses the `H`-carrying chromosome as a template, converting the `S` allele to an `H` allele. This process, called \"homing,\" occurs with a conversion efficiency of $c$, where $0 < c \\leq 1$. Consequently, an `HS` individual produces a fraction $\\frac{1+c}{2}$ of gametes carrying the `H` allele and a fraction $\\frac{1-c}{2}$ of gametes carrying the `S` allele.\n3.  The `R` allele: This is a resistant allele that arose from the `S` allele. It has a point mutation in the target sequence, which prevents the endonuclease from cutting it. It is phenotypically equivalent to the `S` allele in all other respects.\n\nThe HEG imposes a fitness cost. Individuals homozygous for the `H` allele (`HH`) have a relative fitness of $1-s$ compared to individuals that do not have two copies of the `H` allele, where $s$ is a positive selection coefficient ($0 < s < 1$). All other genotypes (`SS`, `RR`, `HS`, `HR`, `SR`) have a relative fitness of 1.\n\nAssume that the population has reached a stable polymorphic equilibrium involving only the `H` and `S` alleles, which requires that $s>c$. Now, a rare `R` allele is introduced into this population. The `R` allele is immune to the homing drive that affects the `S` allele, giving it an effective selective advantage relative *to the `S` allele*. This advantage can be quantified by an effective selection coefficient, $s_{eff}$.\n\nDerive a closed-form analytic expression for this effective selection coefficient, $s_{eff}$.

Let $p$ be the frequency of the `H` allele and $q=1-p$ be the frequency of the `S` allele.\n\nThe genotype frequencies under random mating are $p^2$ for `HH`, $2pq$ for `HS`, and $q^2$ for `SS`.\nThe relative fitnesses are $w_{HH} = 1-s$, $w_{HS} = 1$, and $w_{SS} = 1$.\n\nThe mean fitness of the population is $\\bar{w} = p^2 w_{HH} + 2pq w_{HS} + q^2 w_{SS} = p^2(1-s) + 2pq + q^2$.\nSince $2pq+q^2 = q(2p+q) = (1-p)(p+1) = 1-p^2$, we can write $\\bar{w} = p^2-sp^2 + 1-p^2 = 1 - sp^2$.\n\nNext, we calculate the frequency of the `H` allele in the next generation, $p'$.
