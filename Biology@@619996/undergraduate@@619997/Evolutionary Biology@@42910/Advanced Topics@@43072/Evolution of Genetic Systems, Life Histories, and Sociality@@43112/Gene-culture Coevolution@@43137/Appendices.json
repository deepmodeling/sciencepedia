This practice has been observed for hundreds of generations. The ability to efficiently store and utilize energy reserves during this period is influenced by a single gene, $METF$, which has two alleles: a \"thrifty\" allele $T$ and a \"spendthrift\" allele $t$.\n\nThe relative lifetime reproductive success for each genotype has been estimated as follows:\n- Individuals with genotype $tt$ struggle significantly during the fast, leading to a relative reproductive success of 0.70.\n- Individuals with genotype $TT$ are highly adapted to fasting but show a slight reduction in lifetime reproductive success in the modern era of consistent food availability, giving them a relative reproductive success of 0.95.\n- Heterozygous individuals ($Tt$) exhibit the highest overall success, successfully navigating the fast without the long-term disadvantages of the $TT$ genotype.

For generations, this tuber was a dietary staple, making the $a$ allele strongly selected against.\n\nA major cultural and agricultural shift occurs, leading to the complete and permanent cessation of tuber consumption. With the toxin no longer present in their diet, there is no longer a benefit to producing the neutralizing enzyme. In fact, its production now carries a slight metabolic cost. This reverses the selective pressure.
