This practice challenges you to explore such a scenario by analyzing the classic Hawk-Dove game, a cornerstone model in behavioral ecology. Here, you will construct the payoff matrix from a biological description and derive the stable frequency at which \"Hawks\" and \"Doves\" coexist, illustrating the powerful concept of a mixed ESS [@problem_id:2715302].", "problem": "Consider a large, well-mixed population in which individuals engage in pairwise contests over a single resource of value $V>0$. Each individual expresses one of two heritable strategies: Hawk or Dove. The contest proceeds according to the following biologically grounded rules:\n- When two Hawks meet, they fight; each individual has probability $1/2$ of winning the resource and probability $1/2$ of losing and incurring an injury cost $C>0$ associated with the contest.\n- When a Hawk meets a Dove, the Hawk immediately claims the resource and the Dove retreats without injury.\n- When two Doves meet, they engage in a low-cost display and share the resource without fighting.\n\nAssume payoffs are additive over encounters and proportional to expected reproductive success. Let $p\\in[0,1]$ denote the frequency of Hawks in the population, and suppose individuals are randomly matched. Use the formal definition of an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS): for a symmetric game, a resident strategy $p^{*}$ is evolutionarily stable if it cannot be invaded by any sufficiently rare mutant strategy, meaning that when the population is mostly at $p^{*}$, any mutant obtains no higher expected payoff than the resident mixture, with strict inequality when equalities hold at leading order.\n\nWorking from these contest rules and the ESS definition alone, and assuming the parameter regime $0<V<C$ in which neither pure strategy is stable, derive the mixed evolutionarily stable strategy fraction of Hawks, denoted $p^{*}$, as a closed-form expression in terms of $V$ and $C$. Provide only the final simplified analytic expression for $p^{*}$. No numerical approximation is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the mixed evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the classic Hawk-Dove game under the parameter regime $0  V  C$. An ESS is a strategy such that, if all members of a population adopt it, no mutant strategy can invade under the influence of natural selection.\n\nFirst, we must construct the payoff matrix for this symmetric game. Let $E(S_1, S_2)$ denote the payoff to an individual playing strategy $S_1$ against an opponent playing strategy $S_2$. The resource has value $V>0$ and the cost of injury is $C>0$.\n\n1.  **Hawk versus Hawk**: The individuals fight. Each has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of winning (payoff $V$) and a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of losing and incurring an injury (payoff $-C$). The expected payoff is:\n    $$E(H, H) = \\frac{1}{2}V + \\frac{1}{2}(-C) = \\frac{V-C}{2}$$\n2.  **Hawk versus Dove**: The Hawk is aggressive and takes the entire resource, while the Dove retreats. The Hawk's payoff is $V$.\n    $$E(H, D) = V$$\n3.  **Dove versus Hawk**: The Dove retreats and receives nothing. The Dove's payoff is $0$.\n    $$E(D, H) = 0$$\n4.  **Dove versus Dove**: The individuals engage in a display and share the resource. Each receives half the value.\n    $$E(D, D) = \\frac{V}{2}$$\n\nThe payoff matrix is therefore:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n  \\text{Hawk}  \\text{Dove} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Hawk}  \\frac{V-C}{2}  V \\\\\n\\text{Dove}  0  \\frac{V}{2}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected fitness (payoff) for a Hawk and a Dove in a large population where the frequency of Hawks is $p$ and the frequency of Doves is $1-p$. Individuals are matched randomly.\n\nThe expected fitness of a Hawk, $W(H, p)$, is its payoff against a Hawk multiplied by the probability of meeting a Hawk ($p$), plus its payoff against a Dove multiplied by the probability of meeting a Dove ($1-p$):\n$$W(H, p) = p \\cdot E(H, H) + (1-p) \\cdot E(H, D)$$\n$$W(H, p) = p\\left(\\frac{V-C}{2}\\right) + (1-p)V$$\n\nThe expected fitness of a Dove, $W(D, p)$, is its payoff against a Hawk ($p$) plus its payoff against a Dove ($1-p$):\n$$W(D, p) = p \\cdot E(D, H) + (1-p) \\cdot E(D, D)$$\n$$W(D, p) = p(0) + (1-p)\\frac{V}{2} = (1-p)\\frac{V}{2}$$\n\nA mixed strategy $p^*$ is an ESS if it is an equilibrium point where the fitnesses of the pure strategies are equal. At this frequency, neither strategy has a selective advantage over the other, preventing either type from increasing in frequency. This is the necessary condition for a mixed ESS. We set $W(H, p^*) = W(D, p^*)$ and solve for $p^*$.\n\n$$p^*\\left(\\frac{V-C}{2}\\right) + (1-p^*)V = (1-p^*)\\frac{V}{2}$$\n\nWe expand the equation:\n$$p^*\\frac{V}{2} - p^*\\frac{C}{2} + V - p^*V = \\frac{V}{2} - p^*\\frac{V}{2}$$\nNow, we gather all terms with $p^*$ on the left side and constant terms on the right side:\n$$p^*\\frac{V}{2} - p^*\\frac{C}{2} - p^*V + p^*\\frac{V}{2} = \\frac{V}{2} - V$$\nFactor out $p^*$:\n$$p^*\\left(\\frac{V}{2} - \\frac{C}{2} - V + \\frac{V}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{V}{2}$$\nSimplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n$$p^*\\left(-\\frac{C}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{V}{2}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $-2$ yields:\n$$p^*C = V$$\n\nFinally, we isolate $p^*$:\n$$p^* = \\frac{V}{C}$$\n\nThe problem states that $0  V  C$. This condition ensures that $0  p^*  1$, which is required for a non-trivial mixed strategy frequency. If $p^*=0$ or $p^*=1$, the ESS would be a pure strategy. The condition $V  C$ ensures that the pure Hawk strategy is not an ESS, because in a population of Hawks, a mutant Dove would receive a payoff of $0$, which is greater than the Hawk payoff of $\\frac{V-C}{2}  0$. The condition $V > 0$ ensures that the pure Dove strategy is not an ESS, because in a population of Doves, a mutant Hawk would receive a payoff of $V$, which is greater than the Dove payoff of $\\frac{V}{2}$. Thus, for $0  V  C$, the only ESS is the mixed strategy where the fraction of Hawks is $p^* = \\frac{V}{C}$.
