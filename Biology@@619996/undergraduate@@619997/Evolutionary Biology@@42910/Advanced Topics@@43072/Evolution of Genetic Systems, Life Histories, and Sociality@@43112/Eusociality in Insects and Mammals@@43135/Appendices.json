By working through this scenario, you will gain a concrete understanding of the evolutionary calculus that can favor giving up one's own reproduction to help relatives.", "problem": "The evolution of altruism, where an individual's actions benefit another at a cost to itself, can be explained by the principle of kin selection. This principle is mathematically summarized by Hamilton's rule. Imagine an evolutionary biologist studying a newly discovered species of burrowing mammal that exhibits eusociality, a social structure characterized by cooperative brood care and a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive castes.\n\nIn this diploid species, a single queen, who has mated with a single male, produces all the offspring for the colony. Her older daughters become sterile workers who do not reproduce themselves but instead dedicate their lives to helping the queen raise new offspring (their younger full siblings).\n\nAccording to Hamilton's rule, an altruistic act is favored by natural selection if the benefit to the recipient ($B$), weighted by the genetic relatedness between the altruist and the recipient ($r$), exceeds the cost to the altruist ($C$). For the altruistic gene for sterility and helping behavior to persist and spread in this population, what is the minimum value for the benefit-to-cost ratio ($B/C$)?\n\nChoose the correct option.\n\nA. 1.0\n\nB. 1.33\n\nC. 2.0\n\nD. 4.0", "solution": "Hamilton’s rule states that an altruistic trait is favored by selection if the inclusive-fitness inequality\n$$\nrB > C\n$$\nis satisfied, where $r$ is the genetic relatedness between the altruist and the recipient, $B$ is the fitness benefit to the recipient, and $C$ is the fitness cost to the altruist.

Consider a hypothetical species of eusocial insect, which exhibits a haplodiploid sex-determination system. In this system, males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, while females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid.\n\nA young queen of this species embarks on a single mating flight and mates with exactly three unrelated males. She stores the sperm from all three males and subsequently uses it in equal proportions to fertilize the eggs that will develop into the female workers of her new colony.

This species exhibits clear caste differentiation, with morphologically distinct queens and workers. Two primary hypotheses are proposed to explain the mechanism of caste determination.\n\n**Hypothesis 1 (Environmental Determinism):** Caste is determined by the quality and quantity of nutrition received during the larval stage. All female larvae are genetically totipotent, but only those fed a specific, protein-rich \"royal jelly\" develop into queens.\n\n**Hypothesis 2 (Genetic Determinism):** Caste is predetermined by the larva's genotype.

Therefore, larvae placed into queen-rearing conditions (including access to the specific protein-rich diet) should develop into queens, regardless of their genetic origin, and larvae placed into worker-rearing conditions should develop into workers.\n- Under genetic determinism, larval fate depends on genotype. Therefore, exchanging the rearing environment should not change outcomes; larvae genetically destined to be queens will develop as queens even if placed in worker-rearing conditions, and vice versa.\n\nEvaluation of experimental plans:\n- Option A (genome sequencing): Correlation between genotype and caste would be suggestive of genetic influence but not causal; absence of consistent polymorphisms would not rule out polygenic, regulatory, or epigenetic mechanisms. It does not directly manipulate environment versus genotype to test causality and cannot definitively distinguish the hypotheses.\n- Option B (nutritional chemical profiling): Demonstrating different food composition is consistent with environmental determinism but does not establish causality (differences could be a consequence rather than a cause of caste trajectory). It does not test whether changing the food switches caste.\n- Option C (selective breeding): Apparent heritability of queen ratio could be confounded by maternal effects, colony-level social environment, or nurse behavior. It is indirect and not decisive in separating genetic from environmental determination.\n- Option D (reciprocal cross-fostering of larvae between queen and worker rearing cells): This directly manipulates the environment while holding genotype constant for each larva. Decisive predictions: If environmental determinism is correct, caste will follow the rearing condition; if genetic determinism is correct, caste will follow the larva’s origin genotype and be insensitive to rearing condition. With appropriate controls (age-matched larvae at the same instar, marking transferred larvae, standardized nurse populations, blinding outcome assessment), this provides a direct and conclusive test.\n- Option E (altering temperature/humidity): Changes in ratio would show environmental sensitivity but are nonspecific and do not isolate the proposed nutritional mechanism; lack of effect would not prove genetic determinism. It is not definitive.\n\nConclusion: The reciprocal transfer of larvae between queen and worker rearing environments offers a direct, causal test that cleanly distinguishes the two hypotheses in a single experiment. Therefore, option D is the most definitive.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1922343"}]}
