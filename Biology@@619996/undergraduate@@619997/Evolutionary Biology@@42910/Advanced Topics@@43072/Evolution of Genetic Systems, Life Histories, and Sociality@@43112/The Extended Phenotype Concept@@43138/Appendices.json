This first practice challenges you to grasp a crucial distinction by comparing two cases of animal construction: one involving an inert object and the other a living organism [@problem_id:1970013]. Pinpointing the fundamental evolutionary difference between these scenarios is the first step toward understanding when an extended phenotype can set the stage for co-evolutionary dynamics.", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, the concept of the extended phenotype posits that an organism's phenotype is not limited to its biological body but extends to all effects its genes have on its environment. Consider two distinct examples of marine crabs that exhibit extended phenotypes.\n\nFirst, the hermit crab (family Paguroidea) protects its soft abdomen by inhabiting an empty, non-living snail shell. The crab's genetically influenced behaviors include a preference for specific shell sizes, shapes, and species, which directly impacts its survival and reproductive success.\n\nSecond, the decorator crab (superfamily Majoidea) camouflages itself and gains protection by picking up living sea anemones and attaching them to its own carapace. The anemones' stinging tentacles deter predators. This is a behavioral trait of the crab, and the anemones, which are living organisms with their own genomes, are carried and sustained by the crab.\n\nAssuming that the specific behaviors in both crabs have a significant genetic basis, what is the most fundamental evolutionary distinction between the extended phenotype of the hermit crab and that of the decorator crab?\n\nA. The hermit crab's choice of shell is a completely random process, whereas the decorator crab actively selects specific anemones.\n\nB. The fitness benefit of the extended phenotype is related to predator defense for the decorator crab, but only to structural support for the hermit crab.\n\nC. The decorator crab's extended phenotype involves another living organism with its own genome, creating the potential for co-evolutionary feedback, which is absent in the hermit crab's interaction with an inert shell.\n\nD. The extended phenotype of the hermit crab is obligate (it cannot survive without a shell), while the extended phenotype of the decorator crab is facultative (it is beneficial but not essential for survival).\n\nE. The decorator crab's behavior is a form of parasitism on the anemone, while the hermit crab's behavior is a form of commensalism with the original snail.", "solution": "The extended phenotype concept states that a gene’s phenotypic effects can extend beyond the organism’s body to structures or changes in the environment that influence fitness. The key evolutionary consideration is whether those external effects act on or through entities that themselves bear heritable variation and are subject to natural selection, thereby enabling reciprocal evolutionary change.\n\nIn the hermit crab case, the extended phenotype is expressed as genetically influenced behaviors that result in selecting and occupying a non-living snail shell. The shell is inert and has no genome; it does not evolve in response to the crab’s behaviors. Although shell availability and form are shaped by snail biology, the particular shell an individual crab inhabits does not constitute a co-evolving partner during the crab’s lifetime. Therefore, the hermit crab’s extended phenotype is interaction with an inert object, with no immediate potential for reciprocal, genome-based evolutionary feedback with the shell itself.\n\nIn the decorator crab case, the extended phenotype is expressed as genetically influenced behaviors that involve selecting, relocating, and maintaining living sea anemones on the carapace. Because the anemones are living organisms with their own genomes, any heritable variation in anemone traits that affects the interaction (e.g., growth form, nematocyst potency, tolerance to transport) can be subject to selection imposed by the crab’s behaviors, and conversely, crab genes can be selected in response to anemone traits. This sets up the potential for co-evolutionary feedback between two evolving lineages.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because the problem explicitly states that hermit crabs show genetically influenced preferences; the process is not random.\n- Option B is not fundamental: both shells and anemones can confer predator defense; “structural support” is not the key evolutionary distinction.\n- Option C correctly identifies that the decorator crab’s extended phenotype acts through another living genome, enabling co-evolutionary dynamics, which is absent with an inert shell.\n- Option D is not the most fundamental distinction and may not generalize across species; obligate versus facultative status varies and does not define the evolutionary nature of the extended phenotype.\n- Option E misclassifies the interaction; decorator crab–anemone interactions are often mutualistic or commensal, not necessarily parasitic, and this label does not capture the key evolutionary difference.\n\nThus, the most fundamental evolutionary distinction is the presence versus absence of a living co-evolving partner in the expression of the extended phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1970013"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple artifacts, extended phenotypes can manifest through intricate networks of cause and effect, often involving other species in symbiotic relationships. This practice presents a hypothetical but biologically plausible scenario linking a host's genes, its gut microbiome, and a fitness-enhancing behavior [@problem_id:1970007]. Your task is to trace this complex causal chain to evaluate if the resulting behavior qualifies as an extended phenotype of the host's genes, a skill essential for applying the concept to modern research in fields like host-microbe interactions.", "problem": "In the highlands of a remote island, a species of rodent, the Glanvian Marmot, exhibits interesting interactions with its gut microbiome. Genetic studies have identified an allele, `Allele-G`, which is common in the marmot population. Marmots homozygous for `Allele-G` produce a unique glycoprotein in their intestinal lining. This glycoprotein creates a specific chemical environment that strongly promotes the colonization and proliferation of a particular bacterial species, *Alistipes agilis*. Marmots lacking `Allele-G` are unable to sustain a significant population of *A. agilis*, regardless of their diet.\n\nThe primary food source for all Glanvian Marmots is a native tuber rich in a complex carbohydrate. *Alistipes agilis* is uniquely efficient at metabolizing this carbohydrate, and as a byproduct, it releases a specific neuroactive compound into the host's bloodstream. This compound causes marmots to become more meticulous in their grooming and nest-building activities. Field studies have shown that this \"fastidious\" behavior significantly reduces the incidence of parasitic infections, leading to higher offspring survival rates for marmots that exhibit it.\n\nAccording to the principles of the extended phenotype, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete assessment of whether the *Alistipes agilis* population and the resulting fastidious behavior constitute an extended phenotype of the marmot's `Allele-G`?\n\nA. No, because the fastidious behavior is a direct result of a bacterial metabolite, not the marmot's own proteins. As the effect is produced by a separate organism, it cannot be considered part of the marmot's phenotype.\n\nB. Yes, because the presence of `Allele-G` is correlated with increased fitness. Any trait that increases fitness is, by definition, an expression of the underlying beneficial genes.\n\nC. No, because the expression of the phenotype is dependent on an external environmental factor (the specific diet). If the marmots were to eat a different food, the phenotype would disappear, proving it is not genetically determined.\n\nD. Yes, because there is a clear causal chain: the allele alters the local environment (gut lining), which favors a specific organism (*A. agilis*), whose actions (metabolite production) influence a host behavior (grooming) that is subject to natural selection and provides a fitness feedback loop to the allele.\n\nE. Partially, because while the allele influences the bacterial community, the behavior itself is a learned response to the neuroactive compound, not an innate, genetically programmed action.", "solution": "We apply the concept of the extended phenotype: a gene’s phenotypic effects include causal influences it exerts beyond the organism’s body (for example, via modifications to the environment or interactions with other organisms), provided there is a causally linked pathway from the gene’s expression to a downstream effect that influences fitness, thereby creating a selection feedback on the gene. Gene-by-environment contingencies do not disqualify extended phenotypes; many gene effects are condition dependent.\n\nIn this scenario, the allele in question, Allele-G, causes the production of a glycoprotein in the gut lining. That is a direct molecular phenotype of the host gene. This molecular phenotype alters the local gut environment such that it specifically promotes colonization by a distinct bacterial species, Alistipes agilis. That microbiome shift then leads to production of a neuroactive compound that changes the host’s grooming and nest-building behavior toward a more fastidious pattern. This behavior reduces parasitism and increases offspring survival, thereby increasing the fitness of individuals expressing Allele-G (because only they can sustain the A. agilis population that produces the compound). Thus, there is a clear causal chain: Allele-G expression in the host leads to an altered environment, which shapes the associated microbiome, which produces a metabolite that modulates host behavior, which in turn affects fitness; selection can therefore act on Allele-G through these downstream effects. This matches the extended phenotype framework.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because mediation through another organism does not exclude extended phenotypes; the key is a causal chain from the allele to a fitness-relevant effect.\n- B is incorrect because not every fitness-associated trait is, by definition, an expression of the gene; correlation without a causal chain is insufficient. The definition emphasizes causality and selection acting through the effect.\n- C is incorrect because environmental dependence (diet) does not negate genetic determination; many extended phenotypes are conditional on environmental inputs.\n- D is correct because it explicitly identifies the causal pathway from Allele-G to microbiome composition to metabolite to behavior to fitness, establishing a selection feedback on the allele.\n- E is incorrect because whether the behavioral modulation is learned or induced is irrelevant to whether it is part of the allele’s extended phenotype; the crucial element is the allele-driven causal chain influencing a fitness-relevant outcome.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete assessment is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1970007"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate significance of any phenotype, extended or not, lies in its evolutionary consequences. This final practice shifts our focus from conceptual identification to quantitative modeling, allowing you to explore how selection acts on genes through their environmental effects [@problem_id:1970009]. You will analyze a classic scenario of negative frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of an allele for building a more effective trap depends on how common that trap is in the population. By calculating the stable allele frequency, you will gain hands-on experience with the population genetics that govern the evolution of extended phenotypes.", "problem": "A species of predatory arthropod, known as the Labyrinth Spider (*Aranea architectus*), exhibits a fascinating extended phenotype. Its foraging success depends on the structure of the pit trap it constructs to capture prey. This behavior is controlled by a single gene with two alleles, `T` and `t`.\n\nThe allele `T` is dominant and codes for the construction of a complex, helical pit trap. The allele `t` is recessive and results in a simple, conical pit trap. The effectiveness of the complex trap is subject to negative frequency-dependent selection. When complex traps are rare, prey do not recognize the unfamiliar structure, making these traps highly effective. However, as the frequency of complex traps increases, the primary prey species learns to recognize and avoid them, reducing their effectiveness.\n\nThe relative fitness of the simple-trap phenotype (genotype `tt`) is constant, with a value of $W_0 = 1.0$.
