This exercise explores the profound evolutionary consequences of one such alternative: haplodiploidy. By calculating and comparing the genetic relatedness between siblings in different systems, you will uncover the genetic basis for one of nature's most fascinating phenomena—the evolution of eusociality, as explained by kin selection theory. [@problem_id:1962772]", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying two newly discovered insect species. Species A has a standard diploid XY sex-determination system: both males (XY) and females (XX) develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid. Species B exhibits haplodiploidy: females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid, while males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid. In both species, a single queen mates with a single male for life, producing all the offspring in a colony (full siblings).\n\nThe biologist wants to compare the average genetic relatedness between full sisters in these two species and consider the evolutionary implications. The coefficient of relatedness, $r$, is the probability that a randomly selected allele in one individual is identical by descent to a randomly selected allele at the same locus in another individual.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly compares the sister-sister relatedness in the two species and identifies a major evolutionary consequence?\n\nA. In the haplodiploid species, the average relatedness between full sisters is 0.75, which is higher than the 0.5 relatedness in the diploid species. This higher relatedness is a key factor predisposing haplodiploid lineages to the evolution of eusociality.\n\nB. In the haplodiploid species, the average relatedness between full sisters is 0.75, which is higher than the 0.5 relatedness in the diploid species. This higher relatedness strongly favors outbreeding and increases the rate of adaptation to new environments.\n\nC. In the haplodiploid species, the average relatedness between full sisters is 0.5, which is lower than the 0.75 relatedness in the diploid species. This lower relatedness requires stronger ecological pressures to drive the evolution of cooperative behavior.\n\nD. The average relatedness between full sisters is 0.5 in both the haplodiploid and the diploid species. The evolution of eusociality in some haplodiploid groups must therefore be explained by purely ecological factors, not genetic relatedness.\n\nE. In the haplodiploid species, the average relatedness between full sisters is 1.0, while it is 0.5 in the diploid species. This perfect relatedness makes the evolution of sterile worker castes an inevitable outcome in all haplodiploid lineages.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must calculate the average coefficient of relatedness, $r$, between full sisters for both the diploid XY system (Species A) and the haplodiploid system (Species B). The coefficient of relatedness measures the proportion of alleles shared through common descent.\n\n**Part 1: Relatedness in Diploid Species A (XY System)**\n\nIn a diploid system, offspring receive half of their genetic material from their diploid mother and half from their diploid father. Consider two full sisters. We want to find the probability that a randomly chosen allele in Sister 1 is identical by descent to the allele at the same locus in Sister 2.\n\nAn allele in Sister 1 can come from either the mother or the father, with a probability of $1/2$ for each.\n\n*   **Maternal Contribution:** Suppose the allele came from the mother (probability $1/2$). The mother is diploid, possessing two alleles at this locus. The probability that she passes the *same* allele to Sister 2 is $1/2$. Therefore, the relatedness contribution through the mother is $(1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$.\n*   **Paternal Contribution:** Suppose the allele came from the father (probability $1/2$). The father is also diploid. The probability that he passes the *same* allele to Sister 2 is $1/2$. Therefore, the relatedness contribution through the father is $(1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$.\n\nThe total coefficient of relatedness between the full sisters is the sum of the contributions from both parents:\n$r_{\\text{diploid sisters}} = (\\text{maternal contribution}) + (\\text{paternal contribution}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\n\n**Part 2: Relatedness in Haplodiploid Species B**\n\nIn a haplodiploid system, females are diploid (from a fertilized egg) and males are haploid (from an unfertilized egg). Full sisters share the same diploid mother and the same haploid father.\n\nAn allele in Sister 1 can come from either the mother or the father, with a probability of $1/2$ for each.\n\n*   **Maternal Contribution:** Suppose the allele came from the mother (probability $1/2$). The mother is diploid. The probability that she passes the *same* allele to Sister 2 is $1/2$. The relatedness contribution through the mother is $(1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$. This is identical to the diploid case.\n*   **Paternal Contribution:** Suppose the allele came from the father (probability $1/2$). The father is haploid, meaning he has only one allele for each gene. He passes his entire set of genes to all of his daughters. Therefore, if Sister 1 received an allele from her father, Sister 2 is *guaranteed* to have received the exact same allele from him. The probability is 1. The relatedness contribution through the father is $(1/2) \\times 1 = 1/2$.\n\nThe total coefficient of relatedness between the full sisters is the sum of these contributions:\n$r_{\\text{haplodiploid sisters}} = (\\text{maternal contribution}) + (\\text{paternal contribution}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$.\n\n**Part 3: Comparison and Evolutionary Consequence**\n\nComparing the two systems, the relatedness between full sisters in the haplodiploid species ($r = 0.75$) is indeed higher than in the diploid species ($r = 0.5$).\n\nThis high degree of relatedness has a significant evolutionary consequence. According to kin selection theory (summarized by Hamilton's rule, $rB > C$), altruistic acts are more likely to evolve when the relatedness ($r$) to the beneficiary is high. In the haplodiploid case, a female is more related to her sister ($r=0.75$) than she would be to her own offspring ($r=0.5$). From a gene's-eye view, it is more advantageous for a female to help her mother (the queen) produce more sisters than to reproduce herself. This asymmetry is believed to be a major predisposing factor for the evolution of eusociality, a social structure where a sterile worker caste (females) helps a reproductive queen (their mother) raise offspring (their sisters).\n\nTherefore, the statement that correctly identifies the relatedness values and the major evolutionary consequence is A.\n- Statement B correctly identifies the relatedness values but proposes an incorrect consequence.\n- Statement C has incorrect relatedness values.\n- Statement D incorrectly claims relatedness is the same in both systems.\n- Statement E has an incorrect relatedness value for haplodiploid sisters (it's not 1.0) and overstates the consequence as \"inevitable.\"", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1962772"}, {"introduction": "Sex chromosomes like our own $X$ and $Y$ did not appear overnight; they evolved from a pair of identical autosomes. A key feature of this process is the gradual decay of the Y chromosome, which creates a potential imbalance in gene dosage between males ($XY$) and females ($XX$). This thought experiment [@problem_id:1962781] challenges you to consider a scenario where this dosage imbalance seemingly doesn't require a fix, leading to a fundamental conclusion about the early stages of sex chromosome evolution.", "problem": "In most placental mammals, including humans, sex is determined by the XX/XY chromosome system. Over evolutionary time, the Y chromosome has lost most of the genes it once shared with the X chromosome. This creates a gene dosage imbalance: females (XX) have two copies of X-linked genes, while males (XY) have only one. To correct for this imbalance, a process called X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) occurs in female somatic cells, where one of the two X chromosomes is transcriptionally silenced.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist discovers a new species of placental mammal that utilizes an XX/XY sex-determination system. However, after extensive cytological and transcriptomic analysis, the biologist finds no evidence of XCI or any other form of large-scale dosage compensation in this species. Both X chromosomes appear to be fully active in females, and yet both males and females are healthy and viable.\n\nBased on this observation, what is the most logical conclusion about the sex chromosomes of this newly discovered species compared to those of humans?\n\nA. The Y chromosome has degenerated even more rapidly than the human Y chromosome, leaving only the sex-determining gene.\n\nB. The sex-determining mechanism in this species is not chromosomal, and the X and Y chromosomes are simply homologous autosomes with no role in sex determination.\n\nC. The X and Y chromosomes are largely homologous, sharing a significant majority of their gene content, representing an early stage of sex chromosome evolution.\n\nD. Females of this species are inviable due to the toxic overexpression of X-linked genes, so the discovered individuals must be chromosomally abnormal.\n\nE. The X chromosome contains very few genes, making its dosage level irrelevant for the organism's viability.", "solution": "We begin with the principle of dosage compensation in XX/XY systems: in humans and many other placental mammals, the Y chromosome has lost most genes formerly shared with the X, creating a dosage imbalance where females (XX) would have approximately twice the expression of X-linked genes compared to males (XY). To correct this, females undergo X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), silencing one X to equalize dosage between sexes.\n\nIn the newly discovered species, extensive analysis shows:\n- No XCI in females and no other large-scale dosage compensation mechanism.\n- Both X chromosomes are fully active in females.\n- Both males and females are healthy and viable.\n\nIf females have two active X chromosomes and males have only one X, then without dosage compensation one would expect harmful overexpression in females or underexpression in males. Since both sexes are viable without compensation, the most parsimonious conclusion is that males do not have a dosage deficit relative to females. This is logically satisfied if the Y chromosome carries gene content largely homologous to the X chromosome, so that males (XY) effectively have two doses (one X plus one Y homolog), matching females (XX) with two X copies. This corresponds to an early stage of sex chromosome evolution where X and Y still share most genes.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A: A more degenerated Y would intensify male dosage deficiency, which would require stronger compensation, not the absence of it. This contradicts the observations.\n- B: The problem states the species has an XX/XY sex-determination system; claiming sex determination is not chromosomal contradicts this.\n- C: If X and Y are largely homologous and share most genes, males and females both have two functional copies of X-linked genes, making the lack of dosage compensation consistent with viability. This directly matches the observations and reflects an early stage of sex chromosome divergence.\n- D: This contradicts the observation that both males and females are healthy and viable.\n- E: Proposing that the X had few genes is an ad hoc explanation not supported by the evidence. Moreover, even if the X had few genes, the observed complete absence of dosage compensation mechanisms combined with full viability across sexes is more directly and parsimoniously explained by X–Y homology restoring equal dosage, as in option C.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is that the X and Y chromosomes are largely homologous, consistent with an early stage in sex chromosome evolution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1962781"}, {"introduction": "The evolutionary history of sex chromosomes is written in their DNA sequences.

After recombination ceased, the homologous genes on the $X$ and $Y$ chromosomes evolved independently as nonrecombining gametologs.

Assume constant rates through time, neutrality at synonymous sites, and ignore multiple hits and ancestral polymorphism, so that the observed synonymous divergence approximates the expected number of substitutions per site.\n\nYou are given:\n- The mean synonymous divergence between $X$–$Y$ gametologs in the focal stratum is $d_S = 0.0184$.\n- The per-site, per-generation germline mutation rate in males is $\\mu_{m} = 1.3 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n- The per-site, per-generation germline mutation rate in females is $\\mu_{f} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n- The mean generation interval (generation time) for the species is $g = 3.25$ years.\n\nUsing first-principles reasoning from the assumptions above, derive an expression for the expected synonymous divergence between the $X$ and $Y$ gametologs as a function of time since recombination suppression and the sex-specific mutation rates.
