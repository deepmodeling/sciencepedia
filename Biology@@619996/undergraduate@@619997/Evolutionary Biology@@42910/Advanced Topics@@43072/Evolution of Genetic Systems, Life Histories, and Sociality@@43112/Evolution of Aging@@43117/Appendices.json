Species A is an annual plant; it germinates, grows, reproduces once by producing seeds, and then dies within a single year. Species B is a perennial plant; it also reproduces via seeds each year but can live and reproduce for many successive years.\n\nA new mutation arises independently in both populations. This mutation is in a gene we will call `Gene-X`. The allele `X` of this gene has a pleiotropic effect: it significantly increases the number of seeds produced in the plant's first reproductive season, but it also accelerates cellular breakdown and tissue degradation (senescence) immediately following that first season.\n\nAssuming the mutation has arisen and all other environmental factors are equal for both species, which of the following outcomes is the most likely prediction based on the evolutionary theory of aging?\n\nA.

The evolutionary fate of allele `X` cannot be predicted without knowing the exact percentage increase in seed production.", "solution": "We apply the evolutionary theory of aging via antagonistic pleiotropy and disposable soma: selection weights early-life reproduction more strongly than late-life survival, but the fitness effect of late costs depends critically on life history. For a semelparous annual (Species A), there is no reproduction after the first season; for an iteroparous perennial (Species B), future survival and reproduction contribute substantially to fitness, especially in a stable, low-extrinsic-mortality environment.\n\nLet expected lifetime reproductive success be the sum of expected seed outputs across years, discounted by survival between years. Denote first-year seed production by $f_{1}$ and subsequent-year seed outputs by $f_{2}, f_{3}, \\dots$, and let adult survival between consecutive years be $s$.\n\nFor Species A (annual, semelparous), by definition $s = 0$, so the baseline fitness is\n$$\nW_{A,0} = f_{1}.\n$$\nThe allele $X$ increases first-year seed production by $\\Delta f > 0$, and its post-first-season senescence is irrelevant because the annual has no reproduction after the first season anyway.

Even if senescence is partial (so that $s'$ and/or $f_{i}'$ are reduced rather than eliminated), the reduction in future terms still tends to make $W_{B,X} < W_{B,0}$.

Individuals reach sexual maturity at age 3, with their peak reproductive output occurring between ages 5 and 9. While their maximum potential lifespan is around 25 years, extrinsic mortality from predation and accidents is significant. Observable signs of senescence, such as reduced fertility and slower healing, typically begin to appear after age 12 and become progressively more severe.\n\nA new, persistent viral pathogen is introduced to their environment. This virus is completely benign and asymptomatic in all birds younger than 11 years old. However, it causes a disease with a 100% mortality rate in any individual aged 11 or older.

The population will evolve complete immunity to the virus, and the original pattern of senescence will eventually be restored.", "solution": "Define an age-structured life history with age-specific survival $l(x)$ and fertility $m(x)$. In the baseline (pre-virus) population: individuals mature at age $x=3$, peak fertility occurs for $x \\in [5,9]$, and observable senescence (declines in fertility and somatic performance) begins near $x=12$. Let lifetime fitness be\n$$\nW=\\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty} l(x)m(x).\n$$\nHamilton’s forces of selection formalize how selection on age-specific traits declines with age. The force of selection on fertility at age $x$ is proportional to survival to that age,\n$$\nF_{f}(x)\\propto l(x),\n$$\nand the force of selection on survival at age $x$ is proportional to the remaining reproductive value,\n$$\nF_{s}(x)\\propto \\sum_{a=x}^{\\infty} l(a)m(a).\n$$\n\nIntroduce the virus that is completely benign for $x<11$ but causes certain death at $x\\ge 11$. Let $l_{v}(x)$ and $m_{v}(x)$ denote the post-virus schedules. By assumption of persistent, near-ubiquitous exposure, for selection-relevant expectations we can model a hard truncation at age $11$:\n$$\nl_{v}(x)=\\begin{cases}\nl(x), & x\\le 10,\\\\\n0, & x\\ge 11,\n\\end{cases}\n\\qquad\nm_{v}(x)=\\begin{cases}\nm(x), & x\\le 10,\\\\\n0, & x\\ge 11.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nHence lifetime fitness under the virus is truncated to\n$$\nW_{v}=\\sum_{x=0}^{10} l(x)m(x).\n$$\nHamilton’s forces become\n$$\nF_{f,v}(x)\\propto l_{v}(x)=\\begin{cases}\nl(x), & x\\le 10,\\\\\n0, & x\\ge 11,\n\\end{cases}\n\\qquad\nF_{s,v}(x)\\propto \\sum_{a=x}^{10} l(a)m(a).\n$$\nIn particular,\n$$\nF_{f,v}(x)=0 \\text{ and } F_{s,v}(x)=0 \\quad \\text{for all } x\\ge 11,\n$$\nand for $x<11$ the survival force is strictly reduced relative to the pre-virus case because the tail of the sum beyond $a=10$ has been removed.\n\nFrom the primary evolutionary theories of aging:\n1) Mutation accumulation: Deleterious mutations whose effects are expressed at ages $x\\ge 11$ become effectively neutral because $F_{f,v}(x)=F_{s,v}(x)=0$ there. Such mutations will accumulate, increasing late-life deterioration. Because the truncation occurs before the original onset of senescence (originally near $x=12$), there is no longer any selection maintaining function beyond $x=11$, and pleiotropic spillovers can shift detectable declines toward earlier ages (closer to but below $x=11$), effectively advancing the onset of senescence.\n2) Antagonistic pleiotropy: Alleles that increase early-life reproduction (for $x<11$) at the cost of reduced late-life survival or function (for $x\\ge 11$) will be strongly favored because their costs are paid at ages that, under the virus, contribute zero to fitness. This reweights trade-offs toward earlier reproduction and against late-life maintenance, accelerating senescence and potentially shifting its onset earlier.\n3) Disposable soma: With a hard mortality boundary at $x=11$, the marginal fitness benefit of investing in somatic maintenance that preserves function beyond $x=11$ is zero. Optimal allocation shifts resources from long-term maintenance to earlier reproduction and shorter-term survival, reducing investment in maintenance and repair, which increases the rate of somatic decline and advances the age at onset of senescence.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A. Increased rate of senescence with earlier onset is directly predicted by mutation accumulation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and disposable soma under a strong late-life extrinsic hazard that eliminates selection on post-11 performance.\n- B. Decreased rate of senescence (extended healthy lifespan) would require positive selection for maintenance beyond $x=11$, but the virus removes any fitness returns beyond that age, so there is no selection to extend lifespan unless a separate trait (e.g., immunity) arises and spreads first.\n- C. Unchanged senescence is incorrect because removing all selection on post-11 ages reshapes selection gradients and trade-offs, favoring earlier reproduction and reduced maintenance, which changes the senescence pattern.\n- D. Complete immunity could, in principle, evolve, but this is not what the primary theories of aging predict as the generic response to a late-life extrinsic hazard. Moreover, its evolution depends on genetic and epidemiological contingencies and is not the most probable outcome derived from aging theory alone. Even before or without immunity, aging theory robustly predicts a shift toward faster senescence.\n\nTherefore, the most probable long-term evolutionary response, based on the primary theories of aging, is an increase in the rate of senescence with an earlier onset of age-related decline.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1923893"}, {"introduction": "To move from qualitative ideas to quantitative predictions, we can use mathematical models to formalize evolutionary trade-offs.
