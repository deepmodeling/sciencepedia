However, nature sometimes breaks these rules. This first exercise presents a classic scenario where experimental results deviate from Mendelian expectations, challenging you to quantify the extent of this \"segregation distortion.\" By analyzing the progeny of a test cross, you will calculate the actual transmission frequency of an allele, a fundamental skill in identifying and measuring meiotic drive [@problem_id:1946750].", "problem": "In a remote alpine meadow, a botanist discovers a new species of flowering plant, which they name *Silene ventus*. This plant exhibits a simple trait for pollen grain shape, where the allele for elongated pollen ($P$) is completely dominant over the allele for spherical pollen ($p$). To investigate the genetics of this new species, the botanist performs a standard test cross. A heterozygous plant (genotype $Pp$) is used as the pollen donor (male parent), and it is crossed with a large number of homozygous recessive plants (genotype $pp$), which act as the seed-bearing parents (female parent). According to Mendel's law of segregation, one would expect a 1:1 ratio of the two alleles in the gametes of the heterozygous parent.\n\nAfter the seeds are collected, germinated, and grown to maturity, the botanist examines the resulting progeny. The cross produces a total of 200 viable offspring plants. Among these, 160 plants are found to have developed from elongated pollen (expressing the dominant trait) and 40 plants developed from spherical pollen (expressing the recessive trait). This observation suggests a potential deviation from standard Mendelian inheritance.\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the transmission frequency of the dominant $P$ allele from the heterozygous pollen-donating parent. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "We consider a test cross where the pollen donor is heterozygous $Pp$ and the seed parent is homozygous recessive $pp$. By Mendel's law of segregation, the heterozygous parent produces gametes $P$ and $p$. Because the maternal genotype is always $p$, the offspring genotype and phenotype directly reveal which allele was transmitted by the pollen: paternal $P$ yields $Pp$ offspring expressing the dominant trait, while paternal $p$ yields $pp$ offspring expressing the recessive trait.\n\nLet $N_{P}$ be the number of progeny that inherited the dominant allele $P$ (dominant phenotype), and $N_{p}$ be the number that inherited the recessive allele $p$ (recessive phenotype). The transmission frequency of $P$ is the fraction of progeny receiving $P$:\n$$\nf_{P}=\\frac{N_{P}}{N_{P}+N_{p}}.\n$$\nFrom the data, $N_{P}=160$ and $N_{p}=40$, with total $N=200$. Substituting,\n$$\nf_{P}=\\frac{160}{160+40}=\\frac{160}{200}=\\frac{4}{5}=0.8.\n$$\nThus, the dominant allele $P$ was transmitted at frequency $0.8$ from the heterozygous pollen donor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8}$$", "id": "1946750"}, {"introduction": "Observing a biased phenotypic ratio is only the beginning of a genetic investigation; the next crucial step is to determine the underlying cause. Is the bias due to an allele gaining an unfair advantage during gamete formation (meiotic drive), or are certain genetic combinations simply less likely to survive after fertilization (differential viability)? This problem [@problem_id:1946730] challenges you to use experimental design, specifically the powerful technique of a reciprocal cross, to distinguish between these two competing hypotheses.", "problem": "In a laboratory population of a fictional insect, the Glimmerwing beetle, wing length is controlled by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele $T$ for long wings and a recessive allele $t$ for short wings. An investigator performs a cross between a heterozygous male ($Tt$) and a short-winged female ($tt$). A large number of progeny are raised, and the investigator consistently observes a phenotypic ratio of 3 long-winged beetles to 1 short-winged beetle. This result deviates from the expected 1:1 Mendelian ratio.\n\nTwo competing hypotheses are proposed to explain this observation:\n\n1.  **Meiotic Drive Hypothesis:** The $T$ allele exhibits meiotic drive, but only in males. Specifically, heterozygous ($Tt$) males produce sperm such that the ratio of $T$-bearing sperm to $t$-bearing sperm is 3:1. Segregation in females is normal.\n2.  **Differential Viability Hypothesis:** Segregation is Mendelian in both sexes, but $tt$ zygotes have a lower viability than $Tt$ zygotes, and the survival rate is such that it results in the observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio among the adult progeny.\n\nTo distinguish between these two hypotheses, a researcher decides to perform the reciprocal cross: a short-winged male ($tt$) is crossed with a heterozygous female ($Tt$).\n\nAssuming the **Meiotic Drive Hypothesis** is the correct explanation, what will be the expected phenotypic ratio of long-winged to short-winged beetles in the offspring of this reciprocal cross?\n\nA. 1 long-winged : 1 short-winged\n\nB. 2 long-winged : 1 short-winged\n\nC. 3 long-winged : 1 short-winged\n\nD. 1 long-winged : 3 short-winged\n\nE.

Under the Meiotic Drive Hypothesis, only heterozygous males ($Tt$) exhibit meiotic drive, producing sperm with $T:t = 3:1$. Females exhibit normal Mendelian segregation.\n\nFor the reciprocal cross, the male is $tt$ and the female is $Tt$. Since drive is male-specific, the $tt$ male produces only $t$-bearing sperm:\n$$\nP(\\text{sperm } t) = 1, \\quad P(\\text{sperm } T) = 0.\n$$\nThe $Tt$ female undergoes normal segregation, so her eggs are produced in a $1:1$ ratio:\n$$\nP(\\text{egg } T) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(\\text{egg } t) = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nZygote genotypes arise from fertilization:\n$$\nP(Tt) = P(\\text{egg } T)\\cdot P(\\text{sperm } t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2},\n$$\n$$\nP(tt) = P(\\text{egg } t)\\cdot P(\\text{sperm } t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nPhenotypes follow directly: $Tt$ are long-winged, $tt$ are short-winged.

But can a \"selfish\" allele succeed if it also harms its host? This final practice moves from identifying drive to modeling its evolutionary consequences. You will explore the tension between a driver allele's transmission advantage and an associated fitness cost, deriving the critical threshold that determines whether the driver can successfully invade and spread through a population [@problem_id:1946793].", "problem": "In a large, diploid, randomly mating population, a novel autosomal allele, denoted as $D$, arises. This 'driver' allele exhibits meiotic drive, causing segregation distortion in its favor. In heterozygous individuals ($Dd$), a fraction $k$ of the gametes produced carry the $D$ allele, while the remaining fraction ($1-k$) carry the wild-type allele, $d$. The segregation is biased, so $k > 0.5$.\n\nHowever, the $D$ allele also comes with a fitness disadvantage. It imposes a viability cost on the individuals that carry it. The fitness of wild-type homozygotes ($dd$) is normalized to 1. The fitness of heterozygotes ($Dd$) is reduced to $1-s$, where $s$ is the selection coefficient against the heterozygote ($0  s  1$). The fitness of the $DD$ homozygote is not relevant for the initial invasion dynamics in a nearly all-$d$ population.\n\nThe driver allele $D$ can successfully invade the population, which is initially considered to be fixed for the wild-type allele $d$, only if its segregation advantage is strong enough to overcome its fitness cost. This invasion is possible if the segregation ratio $k$ exceeds a certain critical threshold, $k_{crit}$, which depends on the selection coefficient $s$.\n\nDetermine the expression for this critical threshold, $k_{crit}$, as a function of a single variable $s$.", "solution": "To find the critical threshold for the driver allele $D$ to invade, we must determine when its frequency, $p$, will increase from one generation to the next, assuming it is rare ($p \\to 0$). We can model this by tracking the allele's frequency through the two key stages of the life cycle: meiotic drive and viability selection.\n\nLet $p_t$ be the frequency of the $D$ allele in the adult population at generation $t$.\n1.  **From Adults to Gametes (Meiosis with Drive):** Since $D$ is rare, its carriers are almost all heterozygotes ($Dd$), which have a frequency of approximately $2p_t$. These individuals produce a fraction $k$ of $D$ gametes. The wild-type homozygotes ($dd$, frequency $\\approx 1-2p_t$) produce only $d$ gametes. The frequency of the $D$ allele in the gamete pool that forms the next generation, $p_{gam}$, is the weighted average of production from all adults:\n    $$p_{gam} = (\\text{freq of } Dd) \\cdot k + (\\text{freq of } dd) \\cdot 0 \\approx (2p_t) \\cdot k = 2kp_t$$\n2.  **From Zygotes to Adults (Viability Selection):** Assuming random mating, the frequency of $D$ among zygotes, $p_Z$, equals its frequency in the gamete pool: $p_Z = p_{gam} = 2kp_t$. These zygotes are then subject to selection. The fitness of $Dd$ zygotes is $1-s$, and the fitness of $dd$ zygotes is 1. We can calculate the frequency of the $D$ allele in the next generation of adults, $p_{t+1}$, by considering the proportion of $D$ alleles among the survivors. The new frequency $p_{t+1}$ can be related to the zygote frequency $p_Z$ by the standard population genetics formula for selection. When the allele is rare, this relationship linearizes to:\n    $$p_{t+1} \\approx p_Z(1-s)$$\n3.  **Invasion Condition:** By combining the two steps, we can express the frequency in the next generation in terms of the frequency in the current generation:\n    $$p_{t+1} \\approx (2kp_t)(1-s)$$\nFor the driver allele $D$ to successfully invade, its frequency must increase, meaning $p_{t+1} > p_t$.\n$$2kp_t(1-s) > p_t$$\nDividing by $p_t$ (which is small but positive), we get the condition for invasion:\n$$2k(1-s) > 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad k > \\frac{1}{2(1-s)}$$\nThe critical threshold, $k_{crit}$, is the value of $k$ where the driver's advantage exactly balances its fitness cost.
