This practice explores how small changes in powerful \"master regulatory\" genes can orchestrate dramatic shifts in an organism's body plan, such as causing appendages to grow in the wrong place. By analyzing a classic example of such a homeotic transformation, you will learn to identify the class of genes responsible for defining the identity of body segments, providing a key mechanism for large-scale evolutionary change. [@problem_id:1924950]", "problem": "In a laboratory studying the development of a newly discovered species of marine crustacean, a researcher observes a striking mutation in a single individual. This crustacean is organized into distinct body segments, each typically bearing a specialized pair of appendages. In the mutated individual, the abdominal segments that normally develop a pair of swimming appendages called pleopods have instead developed appendages that are morphologically identical to the feeding appendages, or maxillipeds, normally found only in the head region. This change represents a complete transformation of the identity of the entire abdominal segment's appendages.\n\nWhich of the following classes of genes is most likely responsible for this dramatic developmental change?\n\nA. Homeotic genes\n\nB. Metabolic enzyme genes\n\nC. Signal transduction genes\n\nD. Apoptotic genes\n\nE. Ribosomal RNA genes", "solution": "We interpret the observation: in a crustacean, abdominal segments that normally bear pleopods have instead developed appendages morphologically identical to maxillipeds, which are normally restricted to the head region. This represents a change in positional identity such that an entire segment’s appendage has adopted the identity of an appendage from a different, more anterior region.\n\nPrinciple applied: a transformation in which one body part or segment takes on the identity of another is a classic homeotic transformation. Homeotic genes, most notably the Hox genes, specify segment identity along the anterior–posterior axis and determine which structures form in each segment. Mutations or altered expression of Hox genes can produce complete identity switches of appendages or segments.\n\nCanonical evidence: in arthropods, Hox genes such as Antennapedia and Ultrabithorax control appendage identity. For example, Antennapedia mutations can convert antennae into legs in Drosophila, and changes in Ultrabithorax/abdA expression in crustaceans can transform thoracic/abdominal appendages into maxilliped-like feeding appendages. Thus, the specific phenotype described—pleopods becoming maxillipeds—is a textbook homeotic transformation consistent with altered Hox gene function.\n\nExclusions:\n- Metabolic enzyme genes regulate biochemical reactions, not positional identity of segments; they do not cause targeted identity switches of appendages.\n- Signal transduction genes can influence patterning but, without direct specification of segmental identity, they typically do not cause wholesale, segment-specific identity conversions characteristic of homeotic changes.\n- Apoptotic genes regulate programmed cell death; they would cause loss or reduction of structures, not identity transformation to another appendage type.\n- Ribosomal RNA genes are essential for general protein synthesis and are not segment-specific regulators of identity; mutations here cause global translational defects rather than specific homeotic transformations.\n\nTherefore, the class of genes most consistent with the observed phenotype is homeotic genes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1924950"}, {"introduction": "For novel traits to arise, new molecular functions must often evolve without disrupting essential existing ones. This exercise investigates two elegant molecular solutions to this challenge: the \"copy and modify\" strategy of gene duplication and the gradual repurposing of a \"jack-of-all-trades\" enzyme through enzymatic promiscuity. By evaluating a plant's evolving chemical defenses, you will gain insight into how new genes and functions can originate and distinguish these plausible pathways from unrealistic evolutionary jumps. [@problem_id:1924953]", "problem": "An ancestral species of flowering plant produces a mildly bitter compound, Compound A, in its leaves, which provides some protection against herbivory. The synthesis of this compound is a simple two-step metabolic pathway: a widely available Substrate S is converted into Intermediate I by Enzyme 1 (encoded by `gene1`), and Intermediate I is subsequently converted into the final defensive Compound A by Enzyme 2 (encoded by `gene2`).\n\nA descendant species, living in an environment with more intense herbivore pressure, has evolved to produce a new, highly toxic compound, Compound B, and no longer produces Compound A. Biochemical analysis of the descendant reveals that its pathway also starts with Substrate S being converted to Intermediate I by the same Enzyme 1. However, a new enzyme, Enzyme 2', converts Intermediate I into Compound B. Genetic sequencing shows that the gene encoding Enzyme 2', which we can call `gene2'`, is a paralog of the ancestral `gene2` and shares high sequence similarity with it. The key evolutionary challenge is that the plant lineage could not afford to lose its chemical defense entirely during the transition from producing A to producing B.\n\nConsidering the principles of molecular evolution, which of the following scenarios represent well-established and plausible mechanisms that could independently account for the evolution of `gene2'` and the new defensive trait? Select all that apply.\n\nA. A single point mutation occurred in `gene2` which instantly changed the active site of Enzyme 2, causing it to exclusively and efficiently produce Compound B instead of Compound A. The original defensive function was immediately replaced by the new, superior one.\n\nB. `gene2` underwent a duplication event, resulting in two copies of the gene. The original copy continued to produce Enzyme 2, maintaining the plant's defense with Compound A. The second copy was free from purifying selection and accumulated mutations, one of which allowed it to produce an enzyme that could synthesize Compound B. This new function was advantageous and became fixed in the population, eventually leading to the loss of the original gene copy.\n\nC. A mutation in the regulatory region of `gene1` caused it to be expressed in a different cellular compartment, where it encountered a new substrate, leading to the production of Compound B directly, making `gene2` obsolete.\n\nD. `gene2` was rendered non-functional by a mutation, becoming a pseudogene and causing the plant to temporarily lose all chemical defense. By chance, a completely new gene evolved from a non-coding region of the genome that happened to produce an enzyme capable of converting Intermediate I to Compound B.\n\nE. The ancestral Enzyme 2 possessed a low level of \"promiscuous\" catalytic activity, meaning in addition to its primary function of producing Compound A, it also produced trace amounts of Compound B. When the environment changed, the slight protective advantage of Compound B created a selective pressure. Subsequent mutations in `gene2` were selected for because they enhanced the production of B, gradually shifting the enzyme's primary function from making A to making B.", "solution": "The goal is to identify the most plausible evolutionary scenarios for the development of a new enzyme function (producing Compound B) from an ancestral one (producing Compound A), under the constraint that the organism must maintain a defensive function throughout the transition.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on established principles of molecular evolution:\n\nOption A describes a direct, one-step functional switch. This is generally considered an unlikely evolutionary path. If a single mutation caused a complete switch, any intermediate or slightly altered enzyme might be inefficient at producing both A and B, or produce neither. This would create a \"fitness valley,\" where the mutant individual has lower fitness (is less defended) than the ancestral individual. Such a mutation would likely be removed by negative selection before it could become established, even if the final product (B) is superior. Therefore, this scenario is not a well-supported or common mechanism for the evolution of novelty.\n\nOption B describes the process of gene duplication followed by neofunctionalization. This is a classic and widely accepted model for the evolution of new gene functions. The initial duplication creates genetic redundancy. One gene copy (`gene2`) is preserved by selection to perform the original, essential function (producing Compound A), thus maintaining the organism's fitness. The second copy is redundant and therefore less constrained by purifying selection. It can accumulate mutations more freely. If one of these mutations results in a new, beneficial function (neofunctionalization), such as producing a more potent defensive Compound B, it will be favored by positive selection. Over time, the new gene (`gene2'`) can become specialized for its new role, and the old gene might be lost if the new function completely supplants the old one. This scenario provides a smooth adaptive pathway without a loss of fitness, making it highly plausible.\n\nOption C proposes a change in `gene1`. However, the problem statement explicitly states that in the descendant species, \"Substrate S is being converted to Intermediate I by the same Enzyme 1.\" This scenario contradicts the given biochemical evidence that the modification occurred in the second step of the pathway, involving the evolution of `gene2` into `gene2'`. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption D suggests the loss of the original function followed by the *de novo* evolution of a replacement. This is extremely improbable. The loss of `gene2` function would leave the plant defenseless, making it highly vulnerable to herbivores and likely to be eliminated from the population by strong negative selection. Furthermore, the evolution of a new, functional gene from non-coding DNA (*de novo* gene birth) is a very rare event. The probability of this rare event occurring to perfectly rescue an organism that has just lost an essential gene is astronomically low. This makes the scenario highly implausible.\n\nOption E describes evolution via enzymatic promiscuity. This is another major and well-supported model for the evolution of new functions. It posits that many enzymes are not perfectly specific and can weakly catalyze secondary reactions. In this case, the ancestral Enzyme 2 might have had a \"promiscuous\" side-activity of producing tiny amounts of Compound B. Initially, this would be a neutral by-product. However, if environmental pressure (increased herbivory) makes Compound B beneficial, natural selection will favor any mutation in `gene2` that enhances this secondary activity. This process, often called adaptive refinement, allows a new function to be gradually improved while the original function is still largely intact. Eventually, the enzyme can evolve to specialize in the new reaction. This provides a continuous adaptive path without a significant loss of fitness, making it a very plausible mechanism.\n\nIn conclusion, both gene duplication followed by neofunctionalization (B) and the adaptive refinement of a promiscuous ancestral enzyme (E) are well-established, common, and plausible mechanisms for the evolution of a novel enzyme as described in the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BE}$$", "id": "1924953"}, {"introduction": "Many organisms can change their physical traits in response to the environment, a capacity known as phenotypic plasticity. This practice examines the fascinating process by which a temporary, environmentally-induced trait can become a permanent, genetically hardwired feature of a species. By tracing the evolution of camouflage in caterpillars, you'll explore the concept of genetic accommodation, a powerful mechanism that links environmental cues, developmental flexibility, and the long-term fixation of novelty. [@problem_id:1924977]", "problem": "A fictional species of moth, the Two-Toned Anole Moth, has caterpillars that exhibit a dramatic form of dietary phenotypic plasticity. When caterpillars feed on the young, vibrant green leaves of their host plant, their cuticle develops a matching green color. When they feed on the older, senescent brown leaves of the same plant, they develop a brown color. This plasticity provides effective camouflage against avian predators in different parts of the plant.\n\nConsider a scenario where a persistent fungal blight establishes itself in the moth's ecosystem. This blight causes all leaves on the host plant to senesce and turn brown prematurely, a condition that remains stable for over five hundred moth generations. Consequently, for centuries, the caterpillar population has only encountered and fed upon brown leaves.\n\nAfter this extended period, entomologists conduct a laboratory experiment. They raise a new generation of these moths from eggs on a diet of young, green leaves from a blight-free plant. They observe that the caterpillars develop a brown cuticle, indistinguishable from those feeding on brown leaves in the wild. The ability to turn green appears to have been lost, and the brown color is now constitutive.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete evolutionary explanation for the genetic fixation of the brown caterpillar trait?\n\nA. Through a Lamarckian process, the constant environmental stimulus of brown leaves induced a directed, heritable change in the moth's genome, causing the offspring to be permanently brown.\n\nB. A single, new mutation for \"constitutively brown\" arose by chance in one individual. Due to the strong selective advantage of camouflage, this new allele rapidly swept to fixation in the population.\n\nC. The original population contained cryptic genetic variation, with some individuals possessing alleles that made them faster or more efficient at producing the brown phenotype. In the constantly brown environment, selection consistently favored these alleles, accumulating them over generations until the developmental pathway produced the brown color by default, without the need for the environmental cue.\n\nD. The genes responsible for producing the green phenotype were not used for hundreds of generations. This prolonged disuse caused these genes to decay and become non-functional, a neutral process similar to the loss of eyes in cavefish.\n\nE. The shift to an all-brown environment created a severe population bottleneck. By random genetic drift, the alleles for producing the green phenotype were lost, leaving only individuals who happened to be genetically programmed to be brown.", "solution": "We formalize the plastic trait as a reaction norm: the caterpillar cuticle color phenotype $P$ is a function of genotype $G$ and environment $E$, written $P=f(G,E)$. Initially, before the blight, $f(G,E_{g})=\\text{green}$ on young green leaves ($E_{g}$) and $f(G,E_{b})=\\text{brown}$ on senescent brown leaves ($E_{b}$), providing camouflage-dependent fitness. Let $W(P,E)$ denote fitness; by ecological premise, $W(\\text{brown},E_{b})>W(\\text{green},E_{b})$ and $W(\\text{green},E_{g})>W(\\text{brown},E_{g})$.\n\nWhen the fungal blight fixes the environment to $E_{b}$ for $\\gg 1$ generation, selection consistently favors genotypes that increase the tendency to express brown irrespective of environmental cue. Model the expression as controlled by a polygenic developmental threshold parameter $z$ (e.g., sensitivity to cue or baseline melanin pathway activity), with probability of brown expression $p_{\\text{brown}}(E;z)$ that increases with $z$ and differs by environment. Initially, $p_{\\text{brown}}(E_{b};z)\\approx 1$ and $p_{\\text{brown}}(E_{g};z)\\approx 0$ for the ancestral mean $z=\\bar{z}_{0}$; with segregating standing genetic variation, $z$ has additive genetic variance $G_{z}>0$.\n\nUnder the constant $E_{b}$ environment, selection on $z$ is directional. If individual fitness is $W(z)=W(\\text{brown},E_{b})\\,p_{\\text{brown}}(E_{b};z)+W(\\text{green},E_{b})\\,[1-p_{\\text{brown}}(E_{b};z)]$ and the selection gradient is $\\beta=\\frac{\\partial \\ln W}{\\partial z}$ evaluated at the current mean $\\bar{z}$, then the quantitative response per generation satisfies Lande’s equation\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z}=G_{z}\\,\\beta.\n$$\nBecause $\\beta>0$ in $E_{b}$ whenever increasing $z$ raises $p_{\\text{brown}}$ and thereby $W$, $\\bar{z}$ will increase each generation. Over many generations, alleles at multiple loci that increase $z$ (i.e., make brown faster, more efficient, or less cue-dependent) rise in frequency under selection. The change in allele frequency $p$ at any contributing locus with additive effect and selection coefficient $s>0$ in $E_{b}$ follows the standard approximation\n$$\n\\Delta p \\approx s\\,p(1-p),\n$$\nleading to cumulative fixation across loci. As $\\bar{z}$ passes a critical threshold, the reaction norm is genetically accommodated: $p_{\\text{brown}}(E_{g};\\bar{z})\\to 1$, making brown expression constitutive even when $E=E_{g}$. This is genetic accommodation (genetic assimilation/canalization) of a previously environmentally induced phenotype via selection on cryptic standing variation in the developmental pathway.\n\nWe now evaluate the options against established evolutionary principles:\n\n- A is incorrect because it invokes directed, environment-induced, heritable change (Lamarckism), which lacks a mechanism consistent with population genetics. Heritable change arises by variation and differential reproduction, not directed induction of specific genomic changes by environmental use.\n\n- B is incomplete and less likely as a general explanation. Although a single new mutation with large effect could in principle sweep (with fixation time scaling with $\\ln$ of population size under selection), the observation is more parsimoniously explained by polygenic selection on standing variation over hundreds of generations in a constant selective regime. Moreover, the trait’s prior plasticity and the long timescale favor gradual accumulation of alleles modifying the reaction norm rather than a single origin event.\n\n- C correctly posits cryptic genetic variation in the ancestral population affecting the speed, efficiency, and cue thresholds of the brown phenotype. In a constant $E_{b}$ environment, selection consistently favors alleles that increase brown expression regardless of cue, causing cumulative allele-frequency change until the developmental system produces brown by default. This matches genetic accommodation/assimilation theory and the observed constitutive brown outcome.\n\n- D misattributes change to “disuse.” While relaxed selection on green-specific machinery could permit neutral decay by drift, that process would not predictably yield an optimized, constitutive brown phenotype; it would more likely produce loss of inducibility or dysfunctional pigmentation without guaranteeing effective camouflage. The observed maintained and refined brown phenotype indicates positive selection on the brown pathway, not mere neutral decay.\n\n- E invokes a bottleneck and drift, but no severe bottleneck is specified. Pure drift is unlikely to consistently produce a phenotype that remains well matched to the selective environment over centuries; sustained camouflage implies positive selection, not random fixation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete evolutionary explanation is selection on standing (cryptic) genetic variation that reshaped the reaction norm, leading to genetic accommodation and constitutive brown expression, as stated in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1924977"}]}
