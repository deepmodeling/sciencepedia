By predicting the outcome of a hypothetical mutation, you will engage with the principle of posterior prevalence and understand how the misexpression of a single toolkit gene can lead to dramatic transformations in the body plan.", "problem": "In developmental biology, the Homeobox (Hox) gene family plays a crucial role in specifying the identity of body segments along the anterior-posterior axis. In the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, the body is divided into the head, thorax, and abdomen. The thorax is further subdivided into three segments: T1, T2, and T3. In a wild-type fly, T1 bears a pair of legs, T2 bears a pair of legs and a pair of wings, and T3 bears a pair of legs and a pair of small balancing organs called halteres. The abdominal segments normally lack any appendages.\n\nThe Hox gene *Abdominal-B* (Abd-B) is typically expressed only in the posterior abdominal segments. Its primary function in this region is to specify abdominal identity, which includes actively repressing the formation of appendages like legs and wings.\n\nConsider a hypothetical gain-of-function mutation that causes the *Abd-B* gene to be expressed throughout all three thoracic segments (T1, T2, and T3) in addition to its normal abdominal expression domain. Based on the established role of the *Abd-B* gene, what is the most likely morphological outcome for the appendages on the thorax of this mutant fly?\n\nA. The thoracic segments will be transformed to have an abdominal-like identity, leading to the repression and thus absence or severe reduction of legs, wings, and halteres.\n\nB. The halteres on the T3 segment will be transformed into a second pair of fully formed wings, resulting in a four-winged fly.\n\nC. The antennae on the head will be transformed into legs.\n\nD. The expression of an additional appendage-promoting gene will lead to the growth of an extra pair of legs on each thoracic segment.\n\nE. The fly will have an overall normal appearance, as the thoracic Hox genes will override the ectopic expression of *Abd-B*.", "solution": "- Hox genes specify segmental identity along the anterior-posterior axis, with the principle of posterior prevalence: more posterior Hox genes dominate over anterior ones when co-expressed. Abd-B is a posterior Hox gene whose normal role in posterior abdomen is to confer abdominal identity and actively repress appendage formation by downregulating appendage-initiating genes such as Distal-less and key wing/leg developmental programs.\n\n- Ectopic (gain-of-function) expression of Abd-B in T1, T2, and T3 would impose abdominal-like identity on thoracic segments due to posterior prevalence. This would repress the developmental pathways required for legs (normally present in T1–T3), wings (normally in T2), and halteres (normally in T3), leading to absence or severe reduction of these appendages.\n\n- Evaluating choices:\n  - A matches the expected outcome of Abd-B ectopic expression causing abdominalization and repression of appendages.\n  - B describes a Ubx loss-of-function phenotype (T3 transformed to T2 with a second wing pair), not Abd-B gain-of-function.\n  - C describes Antennapedia gain-of-function (antenna-to-leg transformation), unrelated to Abd-B in thorax.\n  - D posits extra legs due to an appendage-promoting gene; Abd-B does the opposite (represses appendage formation).\n  - E contradicts posterior prevalence; Abd-B would not be overridden by thoracic Hox genes.\n\nTherefore, the most likely morphological outcome is described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2294688"}, {"introduction": "The logic of a \"genetic toolkit\" is not confined to the animal kingdom; plants employ a similar strategy of using master regulatory genes to build their structures.

Solving this will solidify your understanding of how simple genetic rules can generate the beautiful complexity we see in nature.", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists discovers a previously unknown species of flowering plant, which they name *Aenigma botanica*, on a remote volcanic island. The wild-type flower of this plant exhibits a typical structure arranged in four concentric whorls. From the outside in, Whorl 1 consists of sepals, Whorl 2 consists of petals, Whorl 3 consists of stamens (the male reproductive organs), and Whorl 4 consists of carpels (the female reproductive organs).\n\nFurther exploration reveals a naturally occurring variant of *A. botanica* that produces morphologically different flowers. Genetic sequencing of this variant confirms a homozygous, loss-of-function mutation that completely inactivates all genes belonging to the B-class family of floral organ identity genes. These genes are known to encode MADS-box (an acronym for MCM1, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS, and SRF, the first proteins in which this conserved DNA-binding domain was identified) transcription factors.\n\nBased on the established ABC model of flower development in angiosperms, predict the arrangement of organs in the four floral whorls of this B-class mutant, from the outermost whorl (Whorl 1) to the innermost whorl (Whorl 4).\n\nA.

In this model, organ identity in each whorl is specified by the combination of A-, B-, and C-class gene activities as follows:\n- Whorl 1: A alone specifies sepals.\n- Whorl 2: A and B together specify petals.\n- Whorl 3: B and C together specify stamens.\n- Whorl 4: C alone specifies carpels.\nAdditionally, A- and C-class functions are mutually antagonistic, so A is active in whorls 1 and 2, while C is active in whorls 3 and 4.\n\nIn a homozygous loss-of-function mutant for all B-class genes, B activity is absent in all whorls. We therefore determine organ identity in each whorl by removing B from the combinations above:\n- Whorl 1: A alone remains active, so organ identity is sepals.\n- Whorl 2: Without B, only A remains, so petals are replaced by sepals.\n- Whorl 3: Without B, only C remains (A is excluded by C), so stamens are replaced by carpels.\n- Whorl 4: C alone remains active, so carpels are unchanged.\n\nThus, the arrangement from Whorl 1 to Whorl 4 is sepals, sepals, carpels, carpels, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1487565"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary change occurs not only by altering the identity of body parts but also by modifying their relative sizes. This exercise [@problem_id:2294735] introduces allometry, the study of how traits scale with body size, which is mathematically modeled by the power law $Y = kX^{b}$. By comparing two populations with different scaling rules, you will learn to interpret the biological meaning of the allometric equation's parameters, connecting a quantitative model to real evolutionary patterns.", "problem": "In evolutionary developmental biology, allometry describes how the characteristics of living creatures change with size. The relationship is often modeled by the power law $Y = kX^{b}$, where $Y$ is the size of a specific trait, $X$ is a measure of overall body size, $k$ is a scaling constant, and $b$ is the allometric exponent.\n\nConsider two geographically isolated populations of a species of rhinoceros beetle. In these beetles, the length of the male's cephalic horn ($H$) is a sexually selected trait that scales with body size, measured by the width of the prothorax ($B$). Both $H$ and $B$ are measured in millimeters (mm).\n\nThe allometric relationship for the mainland population is given by:\n$H_M = 0.5 B^{1.8}$\n\nThe allometric relationship for a separate island population is given by:\n$H_I = 0.8 B^{1.5}$\n\nBased on a comparative analysis of these two allometric equations, which of the following statements provides the most accurate biological interpretation?\n\nA. In both populations, horns exhibit positive allometry. The mainland beetles will have larger horns than the island beetles regardless of their body size.\n\nB. In both populations, horns grow disproportionately faster than overall body size. This effect is more pronounced in the mainland population, such that for any given percentage increase in body size, the corresponding percentage increase in horn length is greater for a mainland beetle than for an island beetle.\n\nC. The mainland population exhibits positive allometry (horns grow faster than the body), while the island population exhibits negative allometry (horns grow slower than the body).\n\nD. For any beetle with a prothorax width less than 1 mm, island individuals have larger horns than mainland individuals, but this trend reverses for all beetles with a prothorax width greater than 1 mm.\n\nE. The allometric exponent $b$ represents the baseline horn-to-body size ratio. The larger exponent in the mainland population indicates that mainland beetles start with a more dramatic horn size relative to their body size from the earliest developmental stages.", "solution": "We use the standard allometric model $Y=kX^{b}$, where the allometric exponent $b$ determines how a trait scales with size. Taking logarithms yields $\\ln Y=\\ln k+b\\ln X$, so the log-derivative gives the elasticity\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln Y}{d\\ln X}=b,\n$$\nwhich means that for a given proportional change in $X$, the proportional change in $Y$ is multiplied by $b$. In particular, if $X$ is multiplied by a factor $m>0$, then $Y$ is multiplied by $m^{b}$.\n\nIdentify exponents and constants for the two populations by rewriting the given equations with exact rational numbers:\n$$\nH_{M}=\\frac{1}{2}B^{9/5},\\qquad H_{I}=\\frac{4}{5}B^{3/2}.\n$$\nBoth exponents satisfy $b>1$ ($9/5>1$ and $3/2>1$), so both exhibit positive allometry (the trait grows disproportionately faster than body size). Comparing elasticities,\n$$\nb_{M}=\\frac{9}{5},\\qquad b_{I}=\\frac{3}{2},\\qquad \\frac{9}{5}>\\frac{3}{2},\n$$\nso for any given proportional increase in $B$, the proportional increase in $H$ is larger in the mainland population than in the island population. This directly supports option B.\n\nTo check absolute horn sizes across body sizes (to evaluate options A and D), compare $H_{M}$ and $H_{I}$ by solving $H_{M}=H_{I}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}B^{9/5}=\\frac{4}{5}B^{3/2}\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\\frac{1}{2}B^{9/5-3/2}=\\frac{4}{5}\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;B^{3/10}=\\frac{8}{5}\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;B=\\left(\\frac{8}{5}\\right)^{10/3}.\n$$\nDefine the ratio\n$$\nR(B)=\\frac{H_{M}}{H_{I}}=\\frac{(1/2)B^{9/5}}{(4/5)B^{3/2}}=\\frac{5}{8}B^{3/10}.\n$$\nThen $R(B)=1$ exactly at $B=\\left(\\frac{8}{5}\\right)^{10/3}$; for $B$ below this value, $R(B)<1$ so $H_{I}>H_{M}$, and for $B$ above it, $H_{M}>H_{I}$. Thus, mainland beetles do not have larger horns regardless of size (contradicting A), and the crossover does not occur at $1$ mm (contradicting D).\n\nFinally, the parameter $b$ is the allometric exponent (an elasticity), not a baseline horn-to-body size ratio (which depends on both $k$ and $b$ via $H/B=kB^{b-1}$). Hence E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294735"}]}
