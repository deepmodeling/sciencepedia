This exercise uses the classic example of convergent evolution in cavefish to help you distinguish between cis- and trans-regulatory elements. Mastering these definitions is the first step toward understanding how mutations at different genomic locations can produce similar evolutionary outcomes [@problem_id:1931809].", "problem": "Convergent evolution is the process whereby unrelated species independently evolve similar traits to adapt to similar necessities. A classic example is found in cave-dwelling fish. Consider two distinct, unrelated species of cavefish, Species A and Species B, that both inhabit subterranean water systems devoid of light. Each species independently evolved a complete loss of eye pigmentation, a trait also known as albinism.\n\nA team of evolutionary biologists investigates the genetic basis for this convergent trait. They find that in both species, the loss of pigment is caused by the failure to express a single, crucial gene: `pigment-synthesis-alpha` (`PSa`). The protein-coding region of the `PSa` gene itself is found to be undamaged and potentially functional in both species. The investigation reveals two different underlying causes for the gene's silencing:\n\n1.  In Species A, the silencing of `PSa` is due to a mutation in a non-coding DNA sequence located 500 base pairs upstream from the `PSa` gene on the same chromosome. This region normally acts as a binding site for an activator protein, but the mutation prevents the protein from binding, thus halting transcription.\n\n2.  In Species B, the silencing of `PSa` is due to a mutation in an entirely different gene, `regulatory-factor-seven` (`RF7`), which is located on a different chromosome. The `RF7` gene codes for the activator protein that binds to the regulatory site near `PSa`. The mutation in `RF7` results in a non-functional protein that cannot bind to the DNA, thus halting transcription of `PSa`.\n\nIn the context of molecular genetics, a *cis-regulatory element* is a region of non-coding DNA that influences the transcription of a nearby gene located on the same DNA molecule. A *trans-regulatory element* refers to a diffusible factor, typically a protein encoded by a gene elsewhere in the genome, that binds to a cis-regulatory element to control the expression of a target gene.\n\nBased on these definitions and the findings, which of the following statements correctly categorizes the mutations in Species A and Species B?\n\nA. The mutation in Species A is in a trans-regulatory element, and the mutation in Species B is in a cis-regulatory element.\n\nB. Both mutations are in trans-regulatory elements.\n\nC. The mutation in Species A is in a cis-regulatory element, and the mutation in Species B is in a trans-regulatory element.\n\nD. Both mutations are in cis-regulatory elements.\n\nE. Both mutations occurred within the coding sequence of the `PSa` gene, but at different locations.", "solution": "We are asked to categorize two mutations according to cis- versus trans-regulatory definitions. By definition, a cis-regulatory element is a non-coding DNA sequence that regulates the transcription of a nearby gene on the same DNA molecule, such as promoters and enhancers. A trans-regulatory element is a diffusible factor, typically a protein encoded by a gene located elsewhere in the genome, that binds to cis-regulatory DNA to control expression.\n\nFor Species A, the mutation resides in a non-coding DNA sequence located 500 base pairs upstream of the target gene on the same chromosome. This site is a binding site for an activator protein and regulates the nearby gene’s transcription. Therefore, the mutated element is a cis-regulatory element, and the mutation in Species A is a cis-regulatory mutation.\n\nFor Species B, the mutation is in a different gene, RF7, on a different chromosome. RF7 encodes the activator protein that binds to the cis-regulatory site near the target gene. Since the affected entity is the diffusible activator protein, this is a trans-regulatory factor. Therefore, the mutation in Species B is a trans-regulatory mutation.\n\nThis matches option C and rules out other options: A reverses the assignments; B incorrectly categorizes both as trans; D incorrectly categorizes both as cis; E is contradicted by the explicit statement that the coding region of the PSa gene is intact in both species.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1931809"}, {"introduction": "Evolution often works by \"tuning\" existing traits rather than creating entirely new ones. This practice provides a quantitative look at how a small change in a regulatory interaction—specifically, the binding affinity between a transcription factor and DNA—can predictably alter a physical trait. By applying a simple binding model, you will calculate the phenotypic effect of a cis-regulatory mutation, bridging the gap between molecular change and organismal evolution [@problem_id:1931811].", "problem": "In a hypothetical species of fish, the number of vertical stripes on its body is a quantitative trait determined by the expression of a single gene, `StripePattern` (`SP`). The expression of the `SP` gene is activated by a transcription factor protein called `StripeActivator` (`SA`). The quantitative level of `SP` gene expression, and thus the number of stripes, is directly proportional to the probability of an `SA` protein molecule being bound to its corresponding enhancer site.\n\nThe probability of the `SA` protein binding to the enhancer, $P_{bound}$, can be described by the simple saturation model:\n$$P_{bound} = \\frac{[SA]}{[SA] + K_d}$$\nwhere $[SA]$ is the cellular concentration of the active `SA` protein and $K_d$ is the dissociation constant for the `SA`-enhancer interaction. The dissociation constant is a measure of binding affinity, where a lower value of $K_d$ signifies a stronger binding affinity.\n\nIn a wild-type population of these fish, the cellular concentration of active `SA` protein is stable at $[SA] = 4.0$ nM. The dissociation constant for the `SA` protein and the wild-type enhancer is $K_{d,wt} = 12.0$ nM. These fish exhibit an average of 10 stripes.\n\nA single point mutation arises in the enhancer sequence. This mutation does not change the concentration of `SA` but increases its binding affinity to the enhancer, resulting in a new, lower dissociation constant of $K_{d,mut} = 2.5$ nM. Assuming the direct proportionality between the number of stripes and the binding probability remains valid, calculate the new average number of stripes in fish carrying this mutation.
