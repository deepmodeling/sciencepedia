{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A central question in evolutionary biology is how evolvability—the capacity to generate adaptive variation—can itself evolve. Natural selection is famously short-sighted, favoring traits that provide immediate survival and reproductive advantages. This practice [@problem_id:1928312] presents a thought experiment to test your understanding of this principle, contrasting a highly-fit but 'brittle' lineage with a less-fit but more 'evolvable' one. By analyzing this scenario, you will clarify the distinction between first-order selection for immediate fitness and the more subtle, second-order effects that can shape the long-term evolutionary potential of a lineage.", "problem": "Imagine two strains of a hypothetical bacterium, Strain P and Strain Q, competing in a laboratory chemostat.\n\nStrain P has a highly optimized genome for the current environment (Environment 1), which contains a simple, abundant sugar. Its metabolic pathways are extremely efficient, granting it a higher reproductive rate than Strain Q. However, its genome is very \"brittle,\" meaning it has minimal genetic redundancy and a low baseline mutation rate.\n\nStrain Q, in contrast, possesses several redundant metabolic pathways and a slightly elevated, but non-lethal, baseline mutation rate. This genetic architecture imposes a small metabolic cost, causing Strain Q to reproduce more slowly than Strain P in Environment 1. The presence of redundant genes means that some new mutations may be phenotypically silent or \"buffered\" under normal conditions.\n\nAfter many generations in the stable Environment 1, the chemostat's nutrient supply is abruptly and permanently switched to a new, complex polymer that neither strain can initially metabolize (Environment 2). Survival now depends on the ability to evolve a novel enzyme to break down this polymer.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected evolutionary dynamics of these two strains based on the principles of natural selection?\n\nA. Natural selection will consistently favor Strain Q from the beginning, as its greater evolvability provides a long-term advantage by preparing the lineage for future environmental changes.\n\nB. Strain P will be strongly favored in Environment 1, and because natural selection cannot anticipate future conditions, the lineage of Strain Q is destined for extinction due to its lower initial fitness.\n\nC. In Environment 1, individuals of Strain P will outcompete individuals of Strain Q. However, after the shift to Environment 2, the lineage of Strain Q is more likely to persist and eventually dominate because its inherent properties increase the probability of producing a beneficial adaptation.\n\nD. Both strains will likely go extinct after the shift to Environment 2, because natural selection can only act on existing variation, and neither strain initially possesses the ability to metabolize the new polymer.\n\nE. The elevated mutation rate of Strain Q is a selectable trait in its own right. Therefore, once the environment becomes unstable, natural selection will begin to directly favor individuals with higher mutation rates.", "solution": "Let $w_{i,j}$ denote the per-capita growth rate (or Malthusian fitness) of strain $i \\in \\{P,Q\\}$ in environment $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$. In Environment 1, the description implies $w_{P,1} > w_{Q,1}$ due to the metabolic cost of redundancy and elevated mutation in Strain Q. Writing the selection coefficient in Environment 1 as $s_{1} = \\frac{w_{P,1} - w_{Q,1}}{w_{Q,1}} > 0$, the standard selection dynamics in a large asexual population imply that the frequency $p$ of Strain P increases according to $\\Delta p \\approx s_{1} p (1 - p)$, so Strain P outcompetes Strain Q while the environment is stable.\n\nLet $\\mu_{i}$ be the genomic mutation rate and let $\\mu_{b,i}$ be the effective beneficial mutation rate leading to the novel enzyme required in Environment 2. Given the brittle genome and low baseline mutation rate of Strain P, and the redundant architecture and slightly elevated mutation rate of Strain Q, we have $\\mu_{b,Q} > \\mu_{b,P}$. Redundancy enlarges a neutral or near-neutral mutational neighborhood, effectively increasing the target size for innovation and buffering deleterious mutations, thereby increasing the chance that an intermediate genotype remains viable until a beneficial combination arises.\n\nAfter the abrupt switch to Environment 2, neither strain initially metabolizes the new polymer, so both have baseline low growth $w_{P,2} \\approx w_{Q,2}$ that leads to decline unless an adaptive mutant appears. Let $N_{i}$ denote the census size of strain $i$ at the time of the shift. The probability that strain $i$ generates and establishes a rescuing mutation over the relevant time window can be approximated by the evolutionary rescue formula\n$$\nP_{\\text{rescue},i} \\approx 1 - \\exp\\!\\big(-N_{i}\\,\\mu_{b,i}\\,p_{\\text{est},i}\\big),\n$$\nwhere $p_{\\text{est},i}$ is the establishment probability of the beneficial mutant (for small selection coefficients $s^{*}$ in asexuals, $p_{\\text{est},i} \\approx 2 s^{*}$). Because $\\mu_{b,Q} > \\mu_{b,P}$ and redundancy tends to buffer deleterious effects that would otherwise purge intermediates, Strain Q has a larger product $N_{Q} \\mu_{b,Q} p_{\\text{est},Q}$ than would be expected from its Environment 1 disadvantage alone. Even if $N_{P} > N_{Q}$ at the shift due to prior selection in Environment 1, the increased $\\mu_{b,Q}$ (and potentially larger mutational target size) increases $P_{\\text{rescue},Q}$ relative to $P_{\\text{rescue},P}$. Consequently, after the shift, Strain Q is more likely to produce the novel-enzyme mutant first; once such a mutant arises, it will grow faster in Environment 2 and its lineage will dominate.\n\nThese principles rule out several options. Option A is incorrect because natural selection does not consistently favor higher evolvability in a stable environment when it imposes an immediate cost; selection is myopic and tracks current $w_{i,1}$. Option B is incorrect because although Strain P is favored in Environment 1, natural selection cannot anticipate future changes, and Strain Q is not destined for extinction; after the shift, its higher $\\mu_{b,Q}$ increases its chance of rescue. Option D is incorrect because evolutionary rescue can occur via new mutations; selection acts on new variants as they arise, not only on standing variation. Option E is misleading: mutation rate is typically selected indirectly via hitchhiking with linked beneficial mutations rather than being directly favored as an isolated trait; moreover, elevated mutation also increases deleterious load, so it is not uniformly favored simply because the environment is unstable.\n\nTherefore, the accurate description is that Strain P outcompetes Strain Q in Environment 1, but after the shift to Environment 2, Strain Q is more likely to persist and eventually dominate due to its greater probability of generating the necessary beneficial adaptation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1928312"}, {"introduction": "While natural selection doesn't plan for the future, traits that confer evolvability can spread if they provide an advantage in the present.

Its cells are perfectly spherical, a shape that is optimal for this environment. This \"robust\" phenotype is determined by a genetic locus. Let's call the wild-type strain 'Strain R'.

In the original open liquid environment, Strain E has a relative reproductive fitness that is 4% lower than that of Strain R.\n\nA new environmental niche becomes accessible to the population. This new niche consists of a network of microscopic crevices. The robust, spherical Strain R cannot colonize these crevices and fails to reproduce there. In contrast, the plastic Strain E can deform its shape to fit within the crevices, where it thrives, achieving a relative reproductive fitness that is 80% higher than Strain R's fitness in the original open liquid environment.\n\nConsider a metapopulation model where the bacteria are distributed across both the original open liquid environment and the new crevice environment.
