By placing alleles from two different populations or species into a common cellular environment, we create a powerful natural experiment to isolate the source of expression divergence. This first practice problem challenges you to predict the tell-tale signature of a *cis*-regulatory change, where the regulatory information is physically linked to the gene itself, in such a hybrid context [@problem_id:1913965].", "problem": "Evolutionary biologists are investigating the genetic basis for heightened social bonding behaviors in domesticated dogs compared to their wild ancestors, wolves. Their research focuses on a gene, *NTR-D9*, which codes for a specific neurotransmitter receptor in the brain. Quantitative analysis reveals that in the relevant brain tissue, the expression level of *NTR-D9* messenger RNA (mRNA) is significantly higher in dogs than in wolves. It is known that the protein-coding sequences of the *NTR-D9* gene are identical between the dog and wolf populations studied.\n\nTo distinguish between two major hypotheses for this expression difference—a change in a *cis*-regulatory element versus a change in a *trans*-regulatory factor—the researchers perform a classic experiment. They produce F1 hybrid offspring by crossing a purebred dog with a wild wolf. In these F1 hybrids, every cell contains one dog-derived chromosome with the dog allele ($NTR-D9_{\\text{dog}}$) and one wolf-derived chromosome with the wolf allele ($NTR-D9_{\\text{wolf}}$).\n\nThe researchers then conduct an allele-specific expression assay on the relevant brain tissue from the F1 hybrids. This assay precisely measures the amount of mRNA transcribed from the $NTR-D9_{\\text{dog}}$ allele and the $NTR-D9_{\\text{wolf}}$ allele within the same hybrid cells.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would provide the strongest evidence that the increased expression of *NTR-D9* in dogs is due to a change in a *cis*-regulatory element?\n\nA. The total amount of *NTR-D9* mRNA in the F1 hybrid is exactly intermediate between the levels found in the parental dog and wolf.\n\nB. The amount of mRNA from the $NTR-D9_{\\text{dog}}$ allele is approximately equal to the amount of mRNA from the $NTR-D9_{\\text{wolf}}$ allele.\n\nC. The amount of mRNA from the $NTR-D9_{\\text{wolf}}$ allele is significantly greater than the amount of mRNA from the $NTR-D9_{\\text{dog}}$ allele.\n\nD. The amount of mRNA from the $NTR-D9_{\\text{dog}}$ allele is significantly greater than the amount of mRNA from the $NTR-D9_{\\text{wolf}}$ allele.\n\nE. Both alleles are completely silenced, and no *NTR-D9* mRNA is detected in the F1 hybrid.", "solution": "Define the two hypotheses about the cause of higher expression in dogs:\n- Cis-regulatory change hypothesis: a DNA variant linked to the dog allele alters its own transcription. This effect is allele-specific and acts in cis.\n- Trans-regulatory change hypothesis: a difference in diffusible factor(s) (e.g., transcription factors) between species alters expression. This effect acts equally on both alleles present in the same cell.\n\nKey principle of the F1 allele-specific expression test: In F1 hybrids, both alleles are present in the same nucleus and therefore share the same trans environment. Thus:\n- If the difference is due to trans-regulatory factors, both alleles experience the same trans milieu, so they should be expressed equally in the F1: if $cis_{\\text{dog}} = cis_{\\text{wolf}}$, then $E^{F1}_{\\text{dog}} = f(cis_{\\text{dog}}, T) = f(cis_{\\text{wolf}}, T) = E^{F1}_{\\text{wolf}}$, where $T$ denotes the shared trans environment and $f$ is the regulatory mapping from cis and trans to expression.\n- If the difference is due to cis-regulatory variants, the alleles carry different cis information within the same trans environment, so their expression will differ in the F1: if $cis_{\\text{dog}} \\neq cis_{\\text{wolf}}$, then $E^{F1}_{\\text{dog}} = f(cis_{\\text{dog}}, T) \\neq f(cis_{\\text{wolf}}, T) = E^{F1}_{\\text{wolf}}$.\n\nBecause dogs show higher expression in parental brains, if that increase is driven by a cis change linked to the dog allele, the prediction in F1 is:\n$$E^{F1}_{\\text{dog}} > E^{F1}_{\\text{wolf}}$$.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A reports total expression being intermediate. Total expression levels in F1 do not distinguish cis from trans; additive trans effects or additive cis effects could both yield an intermediate total. Not diagnostic.\n- B reports equal allele-specific expression in F1, $E^{F1}_{\\text{dog}} \\approx E^{F1}_{\\text{wolf}}$, which is the signature of a trans difference (shared trans affects both alleles equally), not cis.\n- C reports $E^{F1}_{\\text{wolf}} > E^{F1}_{\\text{dog}}$, the opposite direction of the parental difference (dogs higher), thus inconsistent with a cis change increasing the dog allele; it would suggest either a cis up-regulation on the wolf allele or complex interactions, not the stated hypothesis.\n- D reports $E^{F1}_{\\text{dog}} > E^{F1}_{\\text{wolf}}$, exactly the predicted allele-specific imbalance in a shared trans environment and therefore the strongest evidence for a cis-regulatory difference increasing the dog allele.\n- E reports complete silencing of both alleles, which is not evidence for cis and would more likely indicate a technical failure or an extreme trans effect but does not support the cis hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the outcome that most strongly supports a cis-regulatory change increasing expression in dogs is that the dog allele is expressed more than the wolf allele within the same F1 cells, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1913965"}, {"introduction": "Building on this foundational logic, we can explore more dynamic evolutionary questions, such as the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. Organisms often alter gene expression in response to their environment, and the genetic basis for these plastic responses can also be dissected into *cis*- and *trans*-acting components. This exercise presents a case of evolved differences in environmental response and asks you to use allele-specific expression data to untangle a baseline, constitutive difference from a difference in the plastic response itself [@problem_id:1913997].", "problem": "Two populations of a perennial plant, *Phlox variabilis*, have adapted to different thermal environments. Population A is from a high-altitude montane zone with frequent frosts, while Population B is from a temperate coastal region. A gene named *ICE1*, known to be involved in cold acclimation, is studied.\n\nResearchers conduct a reciprocal transplant experiment, moving plants between two common gardens: one in a warm, coastal environment (Environment W) and one in a cold, montane environment (Environment M). They measure the expression level of the *ICE1* gene.\n- In both parental populations, *ICE1* expression is low in Environment W.\n- When moved to Environment M, plants from Population A show a significant increase in *ICE1* expression.\n- In contrast, plants from Population B show no significant change in *ICE1* expression when moved to Environment M.\n\nTo investigate the genetic basis of this difference in environmental plasticity, an F1 hybrid is created by crossing a plant from Population A with one from Population B. Using allele-specific transcript quantification, the researchers measure the expression of both the A-allele (*ICE1-A*) and the B-allele (*ICE1-B*) within the F1 hybrids grown in both environments. The results, in arbitrary expression units, are as follows:\n\n-   **In Environment W (Warm):**\n    -   Expression of *ICE1-A* allele: 30 units\n    -   Expression of *ICE1-B* allele: 15 units\n\n-   **In Environment M (Cold):**\n    -   Expression of *ICE1-A* allele: 120 units\n    -   Expression of *ICE1-B* allele: 60 units\n\nBased on these F1 hybrid data, what is the most accurate conclusion about the genetic architecture underlying the observed difference in plasticity for the *ICE1* gene between Population A and Population B?\n\nA. The difference in plasticity is caused exclusively by divergence in the cis-regulatory elements of the *ICE1* gene.\n\nB.

There is a baseline trans-regulatory difference between populations, but the divergence in the plastic response is caused by cis-regulatory evolution.\n\nE. The evolution of both cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors contribute equally to the observed difference in plasticity.", "solution": "We analyze allele-specific expression in the F1 hybrid, where both alleles experience the same cellular environment; thus, within a given environment, any difference between alleles reflects cis-regulatory divergence, while environmental responses shared by both alleles indicate trans-regulatory effects.\n\nLet the expression of allele $i \\in \\{A,B\\}$ in environment $E \\in \\{W,M\\}$ be modeled as\n$$\nX_{i,E} = C_{i}\\,T_{E},\n$$\nwhere $C_{i}$ is the allele-specific cis effect and $T_{E}$ is the environment-specific trans effect experienced by both alleles in the F1.\n\nFrom the F1 data:\n- In Environment W: $X_{A,W} = 30$, $X_{B,W} = 15$.\n- In Environment M: $X_{A,M} = 120$, $X_{B,M} = 60$.\n\nStep 1 (cis inference from allelic ratios within environments):\nCompute the allelic ratios within each environment:\n$$\n\\frac{X_{A,W}}{X_{B,W}} = \\frac{30}{15} = 2, \\quad \\frac{X_{A,M}}{X_{B,M}} = \\frac{120}{60} = 2.\n$$\nUnder the model, these ratios equal $\\frac{C_{A}}{C_{B}}$ because $T_{E}$ cancels within an environment. The invariance of this ratio across environments implies a baseline cis-regulatory difference, with\n$$\n\\frac{C_{A}}{C_{B}} = 2,\n$$\nthat is constant across environments.\n\nStep 2 (trans inference from fold-changes across environments for each allele):\nCompute the environmental fold-change for each allele:\n$$\n\\frac{X_{A,M}}{X_{A,W}} = \\frac{120}{30} = 4, \\quad \\frac{X_{B,M}}{X_{B,W}} = \\frac{60}{15} = 4.\n$$\nUnder the model, these equal $\\frac{T_{M}}{T_{W}}$ because $C_{i}$ cancels across environments for a given allele. The equality of fold-change for both alleles indicates that the environmental plasticity observed in the F1 is driven by a trans-acting change:\n$$\n\\frac{T_{M}}{T_{W}} = 4,\n$$\naffecting both alleles equally.\n\nStep 3 (link to the population difference in plasticity):\nIn the parental plants, Population A shows increased expression in Environment M while Population B does not. In the F1, both alleles exhibit the same plastic response (four-fold increase), which, by the above, is attributable to trans regulation. Therefore, the divergence in plasticity between populations must be due to evolution in trans-acting regulatory factors between the populations. Simultaneously, the consistent two-fold allelic difference within each environment in the F1 indicates a baseline cis-regulatory divergence between the alleles that does not change with environment.\n\nStep 4 (decision among options):\n- Exclusive cis (A) is refuted because plasticity in F1 is shared equally by both alleles, indicating a trans effect.\n- Exclusive trans (B) is refuted because allelic imbalance (two-fold) within environments indicates cis divergence.\n- Baseline cis with plasticity divergence due to trans (C) matches the findings.\n- Baseline trans with plasticity due to cis (D) is refuted because within-environment allelic imbalance (cis) is evident and the plastic response is not allele-specific.\n- Equal contributions (E) is not supported because the data cleanly separate baseline cis from plasticity trans.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that there is a baseline cis-regulatory difference between the alleles, but the divergence in plastic response between populations is caused by trans-regulatory evolution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1913997"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we move beyond measuring expression patterns to understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms. A *cis*-regulatory change is not always a simple mutation in a nearby promoter or enhancer; it can result from large-scale structural rearrangements of a chromosome. This practice problem delves into the modern concept of 3D genome architecture, asking you to consider how a chromosomal inversion can rewire regulatory connections by altering the boundaries of Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), thereby activating a gene from a vast genomic distance [@problem_id:1914003].", "problem": "In a hypothetical species of moth, *Lepidoptera exemplaris*, wing spot coloration is determined by a simple genetic pathway. The default phenotype, found in the mainland population, is red spots, produced by the activity of the `Colorase` (`Clr`) gene. A variant population on a nearby island exhibits yellow spots. Genetic analysis has revealed that the yellow-spot phenotype is caused by the expression of a single dominant gene, *YellowModifier* (*Ym*), which encodes an enzyme that converts the red pigment into a yellow one.\n\nIn the red-spotted mainland population, the *Ym* gene is present but transcriptionally silent. Its potential activator is a powerful, wing-specific enhancer known as *Enhancer-W* (*Ew*). On the linear chromosome, the *Ym* gene and the *Ew* enhancer are separated by a distance of 1.7 megabases (Mb). Between them lies a well-characterized insulator element, *Boundary-1* (*B1*), which marks the boundary of a Topologically Associating Domain (TAD). In this wild-type configuration, *Ym* and *B1* are located in TAD-A, while *Ew* is located in the adjacent TAD-B, preventing *Ew* from activating *Ym*.\n\nThe yellow-spotted island population is fixed for a single, large chromosomal inversion whose breakpoints are located outside the coding sequences of both *Ym* and *Ew*. This inversion is responsible for the activation of *Ym* expression in the wing tissue. Assume that the inversion does not disrupt the coding sequence or basal promoter of any other gene.\n\nWhich of the following models provides the most plausible cis-regulatory explanation for the activation of the *Ym* gene in the island population?\n\nA. The inversion moves the *B1* insulator element to a new genomic location, such that the *Ym* gene and the *Ew* enhancer are now located within the same TAD, allowing for their physical interaction and subsequent gene activation.\n\nB. One of the inversion breakpoints disrupts an unrelated gene that encodes a repressor protein. This repressor normally binds to the *Ym* promoter, and its loss leads to the derepression and expression of *Ym*.\n\nC. The inversion fuses a cryptic promoter element from another region of the genome directly upstream of the *Ym* gene's start codon, creating a new, active promoter that drives expression.\n\nD. The inversion moves the entire *Ym* gene from its original location to a new position immediately adjacent to the *Ew* enhancer, reducing their linear separation to only a few kilobases.\n\nE. The inversion alters the *Ym* gene's coding sequence, causing it to produce a transcription factor that diffuses and binds to the *Ew* enhancer, leading to a positive feedback loop.", "solution": "We begin from the stated regulatory architecture in the mainland (wild-type) population: the enhancer *Enhancer-W* (*Ew*) is in TAD-B, while the gene *YellowModifier* (*Ym*) and the insulator *Boundary-1* (*B1*) are in TAD-A. *Ew* is wing-specific and capable of activating *Ym*, but in the wild-type configuration this does not occur because *Ew* and *Ym* are separated by a TAD boundary at *B1*, which prevents productive enhancer-promoter communication across TADs. Thus, in wild type, *Ym* is transcriptionally silent in wings despite the presence of *Ew*.\n\nA large inversion in the island population is responsible for *Ym* activation without disrupting coding sequences or basal promoters. The most plausible cis-regulatory mechanism for such activation is one that reconfigures the 3D genome architecture (TAD organization and insulator positioning), placing *Ew* and *Ym* into the same TAD to enable their physical interaction. This is a well-established mechanism whereby structural variants such as inversions reposition CTCF/insulator elements and alter loop extrusion patterns, effectively merging or redefining TADs and exposing genes to new enhancers (“enhancer adoption”).\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A posits that the inversion moves the *B1* insulator to a new genomic context such that *Ew* and *Ym* end up within the same TAD. This directly explains the observed gain of wing-specific expression of *Ym* via *Ew* in cis, consistent with topological rewiring by inversion. It fits the constraints: breakpoints are outside coding sequences and basal promoters, and the causal mechanism is cis-regulatory via TAD reorganization.\n- Option B proposes disruption of an unrelated repressor gene, which is a trans-acting effect. The problem explicitly instructs to assume the inversion does not disrupt the coding sequence or basal promoter of any other gene. This contradicts the assumption and is not a cis-regulatory explanation focused on *Ew*-*Ym* interaction.\n- Option C proposes promoter fusion from another locus. This does not invoke *Ew* and would not specifically confer wing-restricted activation unless coincidentally matched, and it relies on promoter capture rather than the enhancer-mediated mechanism highlighted in the setup. It is less parsimonious and not the most plausible cis-regulatory route given the emphasis on *Ew* and the TAD boundary.\n- Option D emphasizes reduced linear genomic distance by moving *Ym* immediately adjacent to *Ew*. However, enhancer-promoter communication is constrained primarily by TAD boundaries rather than linear distance alone; proximity across an intact boundary often remains nonproductive. Without invoking boundary reconfiguration, mere adjacency is insufficient. The option does not mention boundary alteration and thus is less mechanistically accurate than A.\n- Option E proposes a coding change in *Ym* producing a transcription factor that acts on *Ew*, which contradicts both the stated function of *Ym* (an enzyme converting pigment) and the assumption that coding sequences are not disrupted.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible cis-regulatory explanation is that the inversion repositions the *B1* insulator so that *Ew* and *Ym* become topologically co-localized within the same TAD, enabling *Ew* to activate *Ym* in wing tissue, as described in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1914003"}]}
