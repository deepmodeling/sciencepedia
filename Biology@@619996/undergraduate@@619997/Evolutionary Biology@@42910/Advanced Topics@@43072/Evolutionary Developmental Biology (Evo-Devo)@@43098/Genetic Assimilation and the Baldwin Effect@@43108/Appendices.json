This practice explores the fundamental trade-off between maintaining costly flexibility and committing to a genetically fixed strategy. By analyzing a hypothetical desert plant in a fluctuating climate, you will determine the precise environmental conditions that favor the evolution of a fixed trait over a plastic one, a key first step in understanding genetic assimilation. [@problem_id:1932934]", "problem": "A hypothetical desert plant, *Arenaria plastica*, exhibits phenotypic plasticity in its water-retention strategy. Based on the amount of rainfall early in its life, an individual plant can develop one of two phenotypes: a \"xeric\" phenotype optimized for dry conditions, or a \"mesic\" phenotype optimized for wet conditions. This ability to adjust, however, is metabolically expensive and reduces the plant's overall fitness (its probability of survival to reproduction) by a constant fraction $c$, where $0 < c < 1$.\n\nA new mutation arises in the population that leads to a \"fixed-xeric\" strategy. Plants with this mutation always develop the xeric phenotype, regardless of environmental cues. This fixed strategy does not incur the metabolic cost of plasticity.\n\nThe environment varies from year to year, being either a \"Dry\" year with a long-term frequency of $p_D$, or a \"Wet\" year with a frequency of $1-p_D$. The fitness of each strategy depends on the year type as follows:\n- A **plastic** plant can always match its phenotype to the environment, but incurs the metabolic cost. Its fitness is $1-c$ in both Dry and Wet years.\n- A **fixed-xeric** plant is perfectly adapted in Dry years, achieving a fitness of 1. However, it is poorly adapted to Wet years, where its fitness is reduced to $k$, with $0 < k < 1-c$.\n\nFor the fixed-xeric strategy to become evolutionarily advantageous and spread through the population, its average fitness must exceed that of the plastic strategy. This process, where a genetically fixed trait replaces a plastic one, is a form of genetic assimilation. Determine the minimum frequency of Dry years, $p_D$, for this to occur. Your answer should be a symbolic expression in terms of $c$ and $k$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the long-term average fitness for each strategy and then find the condition under which the fixed-xeric strategy has a higher average fitness than the plastic strategy. The average fitness, $\\bar{W}$, of a strategy is the sum of the fitness in each environmental state weighted by the probability of that state occurring.\n\nFirst, let's determine the average fitness of the plastic strategy, $\\bar{W}_{\\text{plastic}}$.\nThe fitness of a plastic plant is given as $1-c$ regardless of whether it is a Dry or a Wet year. The frequency of Dry years is $p_D$ and the frequency of Wet years is $1-p_D$.\nThe average fitness is therefore:\n$$ \\bar{W}_{\\text{plastic}} = (1-c) \\cdot p_D + (1-c) \\cdot (1-p_D) $$\nFactoring out the term $(1-c)$:\n$$ \\bar{W}_{\\text{plastic}} = (1-c) (p_D + 1 - p_D) $$\n$$ \\bar{W}_{\\text{plastic}} = 1-c $$\n\nNext, let's determine the average fitness of the fixed-xeric strategy, $\\bar{W}_{\\text{fixed}}$.\nThe fitness of a fixed-xeric plant is 1 in a Dry year and $k$ in a Wet year.\nThe average fitness is calculated by weighting these fitness values by their respective frequencies:\n$$ \\bar{W}_{\\text{fixed}} = (1) \\cdot p_D + (k) \\cdot (1-p_D) $$\n$$ \\bar{W}_{\\text{fixed}} = p_D + k - k p_D $$\n\nThe fixed-xeric strategy becomes evolutionarily advantageous when its average fitness is greater than that of the plastic strategy, i.e., $\\bar{W}_{\\text{fixed}} > \\bar{W}_{\\text{plastic}}$. The minimum frequency $p_D$ for this to occur is the threshold value where their fitnesses are equal. We set the two average fitness expressions equal to find this threshold:\n$$ \\bar{W}_{\\text{fixed}} = \\bar{W}_{\\text{plastic}} $$\n$$ p_D + k - k p_D = 1-c $$\n\nNow, we solve for $p_D$. We can start by rearranging the terms to isolate $p_D$:\n$$ p_D - k p_D = 1 - c - k $$\nFactor out $p_D$ from the left side of the equation:\n$$ p_D (1 - k) = 1 - c - k $$\nFinally, divide by $(1-k)$ to solve for $p_D$:\n$$ p_D = \\frac{1 - c - k}{1 - k} $$\nThis expression gives the minimum frequency of Dry years required for the average fitness of the fixed-xeric strategy to be at least as high as the plastic strategy. If $p_D$ is greater than this value, the fixed-xeric allele will be selected for and will tend to spread in the population, illustrating the principle of genetic assimilation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1-c-k}{1-k}}$$", "id": "1932934"}, {"introduction": "The Baldwin effect provides a compelling mechanism for how learned behaviors or physiological adjustments can become genetic traits over time, without invoking Lamarckian inheritance. This exercise models the core of this process, demonstrating how plasticity can serve as a critical lifeline for a population facing a sudden and dramatic environmental shift.

Both $p$ and $E$ are represented by a continuous real number. Each moth has an innate, genetically determined wing-pattern, $g$.\n\nA moth can alter its expressed phenotype $p$ away from its genetic blueprint $g$ through a costly neuro-metabolic process, a form of phenotypic plasticity. The fitness $W$ of an individual moth is determined by its maximum possible fitness $W_{max}$, a mismatch cost due to imperfect camouflage, and the cost of plasticity. The fitness function is given by:\n$$W = W_{max} - \\alpha (p - E)^2 - \\beta (p - g)^2$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a coefficient for the camouflage mismatch cost and $\\beta$ is a coefficient for the plasticity cost. Individuals are assumed to adjust their expressed phenotype $p$ to maximize their own fitness for their given genotype $g$ and environment $E$.\n\nLet the cost of learning be defined by the dimensionless ratio $c = \\beta / \\alpha$.\nInitially, the population is well-adapted to a stable environment with $E = 10$, and the average genotype of the population is $g_0 = 10$. The environment then undergoes a sudden and permanent shift to a new state, $E_1 = 15$.\n\nThe Baldwin effect suggests that plasticity can act as a crucial buffer, preventing extinction and allowing for subsequent genetic adaptation. For the population to survive this environmental shift, the fitness of the ancestral moths (with $g = g_0$) in the new environment ($E = E_1$) must be at least a certain viability threshold, $W_T$.\n\nGiven the parameters $W_{max} = 100$, $\\alpha = 5.0$, and $W_T = 40$, determine the maximum value of the learning cost $c$, denoted $c_{\\text{max}}$, that allows the population to survive the environmental shift.", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum learning cost $c_{\\text{max}}$ that allows a population of moths to survive an environmental shift. The survival condition is that the fitness $W$ of the ancestral individuals in the new environment must be greater than or equal to a viability threshold $W_T$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the fitness of an individual moth. The problem states that individuals adjust their expressed phenotype $p$ to maximize their own fitness. The fitness function is:\n$$W(p) = W_{max} - \\alpha (p - E)^2 - \\beta (p - g)^2$$\nTo maximize $W$, we need to minimize the total cost term, $C_{\\text{total}}(p) = \\alpha (p - E)^2 + \\beta (p - g)^2$.

It is simpler to first calculate the cost term $C_{\\text{total}}(p_{\\text{opt}})$. We need the terms $(p_{\\text{opt}} - E)$ and $(p_{\\text{opt}} - g)$:\n$$p_{\\text{opt}} - E = \\frac{E + cg}{1 + c} - E = \\frac{E + cg - E(1+c)}{1 + c} = \\frac{c(g - E)}{1 + c}$$\n$$p_{\\text{opt}} - g = \\frac{E + cg}{1 + c} - g = \\frac{E + cg - g(1+c)}{1 + c} = \\frac{E - g}{1 + c}$$\nThe cost is then:\n$$C_{\\text{total}}(p_{\\text{opt}}) = \\alpha (p_{\\text{opt}} - E)^2 + \\beta (p_{\\text{opt}} - g)^2 = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{c(g - E)}{1 + c} \\right)^2 + \\beta \\left( \\frac{E - g}{1 + c} \\right)^2$$\n$$C_{\\text{total}}(p_{\\text{opt}}) = \\frac{(g - E)^2}{(1 + c)^2} (\\alpha c^2 + \\beta)$$\nSubstituting $\\beta = \\alpha c$:\n$$C_{\\text{total}}(p_{\\text{opt}}) = \\frac{(g - E)^2}{(1 + c)^2} (\\alpha c^2 + \\alpha c) = \\frac{\\alpha c (1 + c) (g - E)^2}{(1 + c)^2} = \\alpha (g - E)^2 \\frac{c}{1 + c}$$\nSo, the optimized fitness is:\n$$W_{\\text{opt}}(g, E, c) = W_{max} - \\alpha (g - E)^2 \\frac{c}{1 + c}$$\n\nNow, we apply the specific values from the problem.

In response, the plant population genetically assimilated a chemical defense. Originally, the ancestral allele, $A_P$, conferred a plastic, inducible defense, producing a toxic alkaloid only upon H1 attack. Over evolutionary time, in a constantly H1-rich environment, this was replaced by a derived allele, $A_C$, which causes constitutive (permanent) production of the alkaloid.

The native herbivore H1 has been completely extirpated, while a new, invasive herbivore, H2, has become abundant.
