They conduct a common garden experiment using three distinct genetic lineages (Genotypes G1, G2, and G3) of the plant. Clones from each genotype are grown under three different, precisely controlled soil moisture levels, and their final stem height is measured as a proxy for growth performance.\n\nThe environmental variable, soil water potential ($\\Psi$), is measured in megapascals (MPa).

The common garden experiment is the classic and most powerful method designed to answer this question. In this exercise [@problem_id:1871552], you will interpret the results of such an experiment to deduce why wildflowers from two different elevations exhibit different heights, providing a clear illustration of how scientists can experimentally disentangle the effects of 'nature' and 'nurture'.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying a species of wildflower, *Delphinium decorum*, which is found in two distinct habitats: high-altitude alpine meadows and lower-altitude montane valleys. In their native environments, the average mature height of the alpine population is 10 cm, while the average mature height of the valley population is 45 cm. The ecologist wants to determine whether this significant height difference is a result of genetic adaptation to local conditions (genetic differentiation) or a direct response to the different environmental conditions (phenotypic plasticity).\n\nTo investigate this, the ecologist performs a common garden experiment. Seeds are collected from both the alpine and valley populations. These seeds are then planted together in a controlled greenhouse environment that mimics intermediate conditions. After the plants reach full maturity, their heights are measured. The results are as follows:\n\n-   Plants grown from alpine seeds had an average height of 32 cm.\n-   Plants grown from valley seeds had an average height of 38 cm.\n\nBased on the results of this common garden experiment, which of the following conclusions is the most scientifically sound?\n\nA.

Therefore, differences in mean phenotype between populations observed in the common garden primarily reflect genetic differentiation in height.\n\nIf the height difference in the wild were entirely due to genetic differentiation, we would expect a consistent difference to persist in the common garden, potentially of similar magnitude across environments if $G \\times E$ is small. If the height difference in the wild were entirely due to phenotypic plasticity (environmental effects), then when grown under the same greenhouse conditions, the two populations should have the same mean height.\n\nThe observed common garden results show that plants from alpine seeds average 32 cm and plants from valley seeds average 38 cm in the same greenhouse environment. The persistence of a difference of 6 cm under identical conditions indicates a genetic component. However, the large reduction in the difference from the wild (from 35 cm in nature to 6 cm in the common garden) indicates that environmental conditions (phenotypic plasticity) also substantially contribute to the wild height difference.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically sound conclusion is that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation contribute to the observed height difference in the wild.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A is incorrect because the common garden shows a large reduction in difference, implicating environment.\n- B is incorrect because a difference remains under identical conditions, implicating genetics.\n- C is correct for the reasons above.\n- D is incorrect because a common garden need not match native habitats; it must control the environment across genotypes.\n- E is incorrect because the common garden difference is informative about genetic differentiation.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1871552"}, {"introduction": "Phenotypic plasticity is an adaptation, and like all adaptations, it evolves only when its fitness benefits outweigh its costs. We can explore this fundamental evolutionary trade-off using mathematical models that weigh the costs of maintaining a plastic system against the benefits of deploying a flexible response. This problem [@problem_id:1953311] guides you through building a simple fitness model for bacterial defense, allowing you to derive the critical environmental threshold at which a plastic strategy becomes more advantageous than being perpetually defenseless.", "problem": "A population of bacteria, *Evolutia problematica*, faces sporadic attacks from a lytic bacteriophage. Individuals in the population can exhibit one of three genetically determined defense strategies: a susceptible strategy, a constitutive defense strategy, or a plastic (inducible) defense strategy. We are interested in modeling the relative fitness of these strategies.\n\nLet the baseline fitness of a bacterium in a phage-free environment be normalized to an arbitrary value $W_0$. The probability of a bacterium encountering a phage within one generation is $p$. If a bacterium is infected by a phage and has no defense or its defense fails, its fitness is reduced by a fixed amount $D > 0$.\n\nThe three strategies have the following characteristics:\n1.  **Susceptible Strategy**: These bacteria have no defense mechanism. They do not incur any fitness cost related to defense.\n2.  **Constitutive Defense Strategy**: These bacteria continuously express a defense mechanism (e.g., a restriction-modification system). This constant readiness imposes a fixed fitness cost $C_{const} > 0$, which is incurred every generation regardless of whether a phage is present.\n3.  **Plastic Defense Strategy**: These bacteria possess a sensory system to detect the presence of phages. Maintaining this system incurs a small, constant fitness cost $C_{sensory} > 0$. Upon detecting a phage attack, the bacterium mounts a defense response, which incurs an additional one-time fitness cost of $C_{induce} > 0$.\n\nFor both the constitutive and plastic strategies, the defense mechanism is not perfect. When a phage attacks a defended bacterium, the defense is effective with a probability $e$, where $0  e \\le 1$. If the defense is effective, no further fitness loss occurs. If it fails (with probability $1-e$), the bacterium suffers the full fitness reduction $D$.\n\nAssuming that the costs and benefits are additive and the condition $eD > C_{induce}$ holds, determine the critical probability of phage attack, $p_{crit}$, at which the expected fitness of the plastic strategy is exactly equal to the expected fitness of the susceptible strategy. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $D$, $e$, $C_{sensory}$, and $C_{induce}$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must first formulate expressions for the expected fitness of the susceptible strategy and the plastic strategy. We will then set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for the probability of attack, which will be our critical probability, $p_{crit}$. The information about the constitutive strategy is not needed for this specific question and acts as a distractor.\n\nLet $W_{susc}$ be the expected fitness of the susceptible strategy and $W_{plas}$ be the expected fitness of the plastic strategy.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the expected fitness of the susceptible strategy ($W_{susc}$).**\nA bacterium with the susceptible strategy has no defense costs. Its fitness is only affected if it is attacked by a phage.\n-   With probability $(1-p)$, there is no phage attack, and the fitness is $W_0$.\n-   With probability $p$, a phage attacks. Since there is no defense, the infection is always successful, and the fitness is $W_0 - D$.\nThe expected fitness is the weighted average of these outcomes:\n$$W_{susc} = (1-p)W_0 + p(W_0 - D)$$\n$$W_{susc} = W_0 - pW_0 + pW_0 - pD$$\n$$W_{susc} = W_0 - pD$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the expected fitness of the plastic strategy ($W_{plas}$).**\nA bacterium with the plastic strategy always incurs the cost of maintaining its sensory system, $C_{sensory}$. So its fitness is at most $W_0 - C_{sensory}$.\n-   With probability $(1-p)$, there is no phage attack. The only cost incurred is the sensory cost. The fitness is $W_0 - C_{sensory}$.\n-   With probability $p$, a phage attacks. In this case, the bacterium incurs both the sensory cost $C_{sensory}$ and the induction cost $C_{induce}$. The defense is then deployed.\n    -   The defense is successful with probability $e$. The total fitness reduction is $C_{sensory} + C_{induce}$. The fitness is $W_0 - C_{sensory} - C_{induce}$.\n    -   The defense fails with probability $(1-e)$. The bacterium suffers the full damage $D$ in addition to the costs of defense. The total fitness reduction is $C_{sensory} + C_{induce} + D$. The fitness is $W_0 - C_{sensory} - C_{induce} - D$.\nThe expected fitness upon attack is the weighted average of these two sub-outcomes: $e(W_0 - C_{sensory} - C_{induce}) + (1-e)(W_0 - C_{sensory} - C_{induce} - D)$.\nThis simplifies to $W_0 - C_{sensory} - C_{induce} - (1-e)D$.\n\nNow, we can write the overall expected fitness for the plastic strategy by averaging over the attack and no-attack scenarios:\n$$W_{plas} = (1-p)(W_0 - C_{sensory}) + p(W_0 - C_{sensory} - C_{induce} - (1-e)D)$$\n$$W_{plas} = (1-p)W_0 - (1-p)C_{sensory} + pW_0 - pC_{sensory} - pC_{induce} - p(1-e)D$$\n$$W_{plas} = W_0 - C_{sensory}((1-p)+p) - pC_{induce} - p(1-e)D$$\n$$W_{plas} = W_0 - C_{sensory} - pC_{induce} - p(1-e)D$$\n\n**Step 3: Equate the expected fitnesses and solve for $p_{crit}$.**\nThe critical probability $p_{crit}$ is the value of $p$ for which $W_{susc} = W_{plas}$.\n$$W_0 - p_{crit}D = W_0 - C_{sensory} - p_{crit}C_{induce} - p_{crit}(1-e)D$$\nWe can cancel the $W_0$ term from both sides:\n$$-p_{crit}D = -C_{sensory} - p_{crit}C_{induce} - p_{crit}(1-e)D$$\nLet's expand the last term:\n$$-p_{crit}D = -C_{sensory} - p_{crit}C_{induce} - p_{crit}D + p_{crit}eD$$\nThe term $-p_{crit}D$ appears on both sides and can be cancelled:\n$$0 = -C_{sensory} - p_{crit}C_{induce} + p_{crit}eD$$\nNow, we solve for $p_{crit}$.
