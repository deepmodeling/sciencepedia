This exercise explores the stark consequences of imprinting, a process where epigenetic marks silence one parental allele, leaving the organism to rely on a single active copy. By working through a hypothetical scenario involving an essential gene [@problem_id:1921781], you will solidify your understanding of how imprinting works and why its disruption can have severe developmental outcomes.", "problem": "In a particular mammalian species, a gene known as `Cerebral Development Regulator` (`CDR`) plays an essential role in the formation of the cerebral cortex. The expression of `CDR` is subject to a phenomenon called genomic imprinting, where only the allele inherited from one parent is transcriptionally active. For the `CDR` gene, experimental evidence shows that only the maternally inherited allele is expressed in the developing embryo, while the paternally inherited allele is consistently silenced via DNA methylation.\n\nConsider a scenario involving a mating pair. The male parent is heterozygous, carrying one functional `CDR` allele and one non-functional allele with a complete deletion. The female parent is homozygous for the functional `CDR` allele. An offspring is produced from this pair that, by chance, inherits the non-functional (deleted) allele from the male parent and also, due to a spontaneous *de novo* deletion event during oogenesis, inherits a non-functional (deleted) allele from the female parent.\n\nWhat is the most likely phenotypic consequence for this offspring regarding brain development controlled by the `CDR` gene?\n\nA. The offspring will develop normally because the imprinting on the paternal allele will be reversed to compensate for the lack of a maternal allele.\n\nB. The offspring will exhibit a severe neurodevelopmental defect because it will lack any functional copies of the `CDR` gene.\n\nC. The offspring will be phenotypically normal but act as a carrier of a deleterious allele, as the silent paternal copy provides a sufficient backup.\n\nD. The offspring's phenotype will be normal because all parental epigenetic imprints are erased and reset immediately after fertilization.\n\nE. The offspring will have a 50% chance of normal development, depending on which parental allele is randomly silenced in the brain cells.", "solution": "Genomic imprinting is a parent-of-origin-specific monoallelic expression phenomenon established by DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks during gametogenesis and maintained after fertilization in somatic development. By the problem statement, the gene is maternally expressed and the paternally inherited allele is silenced via DNA methylation.\n\nLet the functional allele be denoted $+$ and the deletion allele be denoted $\\Delta$. The male is heterozygous $+/ \\Delta$ and the female is $+/+$, but in this specific offspring:\n- The offspring inherits the paternal $\\Delta$ allele (deleted) from the heterozygous father.\n- A de novo deletion occurs in oogenesis, so the maternal allele transmitted is also $\\Delta$.\n\nTherefore, the offspringâ€™s genotype is $\\Delta_{m}/\\Delta_{p}$, where the subscript indicates parent of origin. Because only the maternally inherited allele is expressed for this imprinted gene, the effective expression level in the offspring equals the activity of the maternal allele. Here, the maternal allele is a deletion, so its expression yields no functional product. The paternal allele is both deleted and, even if intact, would be transcriptionally silenced due to imprinting.\n\nThus, the offspring has no functional copies of the gene expressed in the developing brain. Given that the gene is essential for cerebral cortex formation, the most likely phenotypic consequence is a severe neurodevelopmental defect.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A is incorrect because somatic reversal of imprinting to compensate does not occur; imprinted silencing is maintained in development.\n- C is incorrect because a silenced paternal allele cannot serve as a backup, and in this case it is also deleted.\n- D is incorrect because although global demethylation occurs after fertilization, imprinting control regions are protected; imprints are not all erased and reset immediately in the zygote.\n- E is incorrect because imprinting is parent-of-origin specific, not random monoallelic expression.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1921781"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary biologists often predict the response of a population to selection using the breeder's equation, $R = h^{2}S$. Traditionally, the narrow-sense heritability, $h^{2}$, has been attributed solely to additive genetic effects. This problem [@problem_id:1921803] challenges you to adapt this foundational model by incorporating an 'epigenetic heritability' ($e^{2}$), acknowledging that stably inherited epigenetic marks can also contribute to parent-offspring resemblance and influence the pace of short-term evolution.", "problem": "A research team is studying the evolutionary dynamics of anxiety-like behavior in a large, captive population of house mice (*Mus musculus*). They quantify this behavior using a \"Thigmotaxis Score,\" a unitless metric where higher scores indicate a greater tendency for an individual to remain near the walls of an enclosure, a common proxy for anxiety in rodent models.\n\nThe mean Thigmotaxis Score for the entire population in the founding generation is $\\bar{T}_0 = 55.0$.\n\nFrom this population, the researchers implement an artificial selection experiment. They select only the individuals with the highest scores to be the parents of the next generation. The mean Thigmotaxis Score of this selected parental group is $\\bar{T}_p = 80.0$.\n\nThrough extensive pedigree analysis and bisulfite sequencing, it has been determined that the parent-offspring resemblance for this behavioral trait is due to two independent, additive components:\n1.  Additive genetic variance, which gives rise to a narrow-sense heritability of $h^2 = 0.25$.\n2.  Transgenerationally stable DNA methylation patterns that are reliably passed from parent to offspring. The fraction of total phenotypic variance attributable to these heritable epigenetic marks, termed \"epigenetic heritability,\" is estimated to be $e^2 = 0.15$.\n\nAssuming that both the genetic and heritable epigenetic components contribute to the response to selection in an additive fashion, calculate the predicted mean Thigmotaxis Score for the first offspring generation, $\\bar{T}_1$.

By balancing the forces of natural selection, environmentally-induced epigenetic changes, and spontaneous reversion [@problem_id:1921821], you will derive from first principles the equilibrium frequency of an adaptive epigenetic state, a core skill in modern evolutionary theory.", "problem": "In the study of evolutionary adaptation, attention has recently turned to the role of heritable epigenetic modifications, so-called \"epialleles,\" which can alter phenotype without changing the underlying DNA sequence.\n\nConsider a large, theoretical population of haploid organisms. At a particular genetic locus, an epiallele can exist in one of two states: a standard, unmodified state `E`, or a modified, adaptive state `E*`. The presence of the `E*` epiallele confers a constant selective advantage. The relative fitness of individuals carrying `E` is normalized to 1, while the relative fitness of individuals carrying `E*` is $1+s$, where $s>0$ is the selection coefficient.\n\nThe epigenetic state is passed to offspring but is subject to changes. The life cycle within each generation proceeds in a specific order: first, adults reproduce based on their fitness (selection), and then epigenetic modifications occur in the resulting offspring before they mature. The rates of modification are as follows:\n- An `E` state is induced to become an `E*` state at a rate of $v$ per individual per generation.\n- An `E*` state spontaneously reverts to an `E` state at a rate of $u$ per individual per generation.\n\nThe parameters $s$, $u$, and $v$ are all positive real numbers less than 1. After many generations, the frequency of the `E*` epiallele in the population is expected to reach a stable equilibrium.\n\nDetermine the equilibrium frequency of the `E*` epiallele. Your answer should be a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $s$, $u$, and $v$.", "solution": "Let $p_{t}$ denote the frequency of the adaptive epiallele $E^{*}$ among adults at the start of generation $t$.
