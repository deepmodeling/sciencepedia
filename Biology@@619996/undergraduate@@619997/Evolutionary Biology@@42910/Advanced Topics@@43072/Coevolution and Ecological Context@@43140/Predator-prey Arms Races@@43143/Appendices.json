This problem explores a classic scenario of conflicting selective pressures on a prey animal's coloration. By analyzing the fitness consequences of mimicry versus camouflage against different predators, you will practice identifying the resulting mode of selection, such as disruptive selection, which can maintain diversity within a population [@problem_id:1956470].", "problem": "On a remote island, a non-venomous snake species, *Coluber imitator*, coexists with a highly venomous snake, *Serpens letalis*. The venomous *S. letalis* possesses a distinctive, bright red and yellow banded coloration, which serves as an aposematic (warning) signal to potential predators. Within the *C. imitator* population, two primary coloration phenotypes exist, controlled by a single genetic locus: a \"mimic\" phenotype that closely resembles the dangerous *S. letalis*, and a \"cryptic\" phenotype that is a plain, earthy brown, providing camouflage against the forest floor.\n\nThe island's ecosystem includes two significant predators of these snakes:\n\n1.  **The Island Hawk (*Accipiter insularis*)**: This bird hunts purely by sight. Through learned experience, it avoids attacking the venomous *S. letalis*. Consequently, it also avoids the mimic phenotype of *C. imitator*. However, it readily preys upon the cryptic brown snakes when it can spot them against the background.\n\n2.  **The Island Mongoose (*Mungos impervius*)**: This mammal is a specialized snake-eater and possesses a complete physiological immunity to the venom of *S. letalis*. It actively hunts both snake species. Due to its keen sense of smell, it can perfectly distinguish the non-venomous *C. imitator* from the venomous *S. letalis*. For the mongoose, the bright coloration of the mimic phenotype makes it significantly more conspicuous and easier to locate than the camouflaged cryptic phenotype.\n\nAssume that both predators exert significant and roughly equivalent selective pressure on the *C. imitator* population. Which of the following statements describes the most likely evolutionary outcome for the coloration trait in the *C. imitator* population under these specific conditions?\n\nA. Directional selection will favor the mimic phenotype, leading it to become fixed in the population, as the benefit of avoiding avian predation is paramount.\n\nB. Directional selection will favor the cryptic phenotype, leading it to become fixed in the population, as being conspicuous to an immune predator is an overwhelming disadvantage.\n\nC. Disruptive selection will occur, potentially leading to a stable polymorphism where both the mimic and cryptic phenotypes are maintained in the population at significant frequencies.\n\nD. Stabilizing selection will favor an intermediate phenotype that is neither perfectly mimic nor perfectly cryptic, representing a compromise between the two conflicting pressures.\n\nE. The *C. imitator* population will inevitably go extinct, as it is caught in a \"no-win\" evolutionary trap between the two predators.", "solution": "To determine the most likely evolutionary outcome, we must analyze the selective pressures exerted by each predator on the two phenotypes of *Coluber imitator*.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the selective pressure from the Island Hawk (*Accipiter insularis*).**\nThe hawk hunts by sight and avoids the warning coloration of the venomous model, *Serpens letalis*. Because the mimic phenotype of *C. imitator* shares this coloration, it gains a fitness advantage by avoiding predation from the hawk. This is a classic example of Batesian mimicry. Conversely, the cryptic phenotype does not benefit from this mimicry and is actively preyed upon by the hawk. Therefore, the Island Hawk exerts a positive selective pressure on the mimic allele and a negative selective pressure on the cryptic allele.\n\n*   Fitness (vs. Hawk): Mimic > Cryptic\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the selective pressure from the Island Mongoose (*Mungos impervius*).**\nThe mongoose is immune to the venom and can distinguish the mimic from the venomous model using its sense of smell. For this predator, the warning coloration is not a deterrent. Instead, the bright, conspicuous colors of the mimic phenotype make it easier to spot against the environment compared to the camouflaged, cryptic phenotype. As a result, the mimic phenotype suffers a higher rate of predation from the mongoose. The cryptic phenotype has a fitness advantage because its camouflage makes it harder for the mongoose to find. Therefore, the Island Mongoose exerts a negative selective pressure on the mimic allele and a positive selective pressure on the cryptic allele.\n\n*   Fitness (vs. Mongoose): Cryptic > Mimic\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the conflicting selective pressures.**\nWe have two opposing selective forces acting on the same trait (coloration).\n- The mimic phenotype is advantageous for surviving hawk predation but disadvantageous for surviving mongoose predation.\n- The cryptic phenotype is disadvantageous for surviving hawk predation but advantageous for surviving mongoose predation.\n\nNeither phenotype has a universal fitness advantage across all contexts. When selection favors extreme phenotypes (in this case, being a very convincing mimic to fool hawks, or being very camouflaged to hide from mongooses) over intermediate forms, the process is known as disruptive selection (or diversifying selection).\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options based on the analysis.**\n*   **A. Directional selection for the mimic phenotype:** This is incorrect because it ignores the strong negative selective pressure from the mongoose.\n*   **B. Directional selection for the cryptic phenotype:** This is incorrect because it ignores the strong negative selective pressure from the hawk.\n*   **C. Disruptive selection:** This accurately describes a situation where two or more distinct phenotypes are favored over intermediate ones due to opposing environmental pressures. This can lead to a balanced state called a stable polymorphism, where the relative fitness of each phenotype depends on its frequency and the intensity of predation, allowing both to persist in the population. This is the most accurate description of the scenario.\n*   **D. Stabilizing selection:** This is incorrect. Stabilizing selection would favor an intermediate phenotype and select against the extremes. Here, the extremes (perfect mimicry or perfect camouflage) are what confer advantages against one predator or the other. An intermediate form would likely be poorly camouflaged *and* an unconvincing mimic, making it vulnerable to both predators.\n*   **E. Inevitable extinction:** While a possible demographic outcome if the combined predation is too intense, it is not the primary *evolutionary process* at play. Disruptive selection is the evolutionary mechanism that results from these conflicting pressures. The problem asks for the most likely evolutionary outcome, which is the process of selection itself and its effect on allele frequencies. Disruptive selection leading to polymorphism is the direct evolutionary consequence.\n\nTherefore, the conflicting pressures from the two predators will result in disruptive selection, likely maintaining both phenotypes in the population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1956470"}, {"introduction": "When different strategies are maintained in a population, their success often depends on how common they are. This problem presents a case of frequency-dependent selection, where a plant's life-history strategy is shaped by a specialist seed predator whose impact varies with the frequency of its target. By setting up a fitness model and finding the equilibrium, you will learn how the balance between costs ($c_A$) and benefits (predator avoidance) determines the stable frequency of different alleles in the population [@problem_id:1956477].", "problem": "A species of biennial plant, *Silene noctiflora*, faces intense seed predation from a specialist weevil. This selective pressure has led to a stable genetic polymorphism at a single locus that controls the plant's life-history strategy. Two alleles exist at this locus: allele 'A' and allele 'B'.\n\nPlants with at least one 'A' allele adopt an \"accelerated\" annual strategy, flowering and setting seed in their first year. This strategy allows them to completely avoid predation, as the weevil's life cycle is synchronized to emerge and attack only second-year plants. However, this rapid development incurs a significant physiological cost, reducing the plant's total viable seed output by a fixed fraction $c_A$ compared to the output of a biennial plant that experiences no predation.\n\nPlants with the homozygous 'BB' genotype adopt a \"patient\" biennial strategy, flowering and setting seed in their second year. These plants do not suffer the physiological cost $c_A$. However, they are subject to predation by the weevils. The effectiveness of the weevil predation is density-dependent. Specifically, the fraction of seeds on any given biennial plant that are destroyed by weevils is directly proportional to the frequency of the biennial allele 'B' in the population. This relationship is described by the expression $d \\cdot q$, where $q$ is the frequency of allele 'B' and $d$ is a dimensionless predation intensity coefficient. The parameters $c_A$ and $d$ are positive constants less than 1.\n\nFor simplicity, you may assume a large, randomly mating population where the fitness of a strategy is determined solely by its expected seed output. Let the fitness of each strategy be directly proportional to the number of viable seeds it produces.\n\nAssuming the population has reached a stable polymorphic equilibrium where both the annual and biennial strategies coexist, derive a symbolic expression for the equilibrium frequency of the biennial allele, 'B'.", "solution": "Let $p$ and $q$ denote the allele frequencies of $A$ and $B$, respectively, with $p+q=1$. Let the baseline viable seed output of a biennial plant without predation be an arbitrary constant $S>0$. Because fitness is proportional to viable seed output, we can measure all fitnesses relative to $S$, so the proportionality factor cancels and we may take $S=1$ without loss of generality.\n\nBy the problem statement, allele $A$ is dominant for the annual strategy, so genotypes $AA$ and $AB$ both express the annual strategy and incur the physiological cost $c_{A}$. The biennial strategy occurs only in the homozygous $BB$ genotype and suffers a predation fraction $d\\,q$, where $q$ is the frequency of allele $B$ in the population.\n\nThus, the genotype fitnesses (viable seed outputs, normalized by $S$) are:\n$$\nW_{AA}=1-c_{A},\\quad W_{AB}=1-c_{A},\\quad W_{BB}=1-d\\,q.\n$$\n\nUnder random mating, the marginal (allele) fitnesses are:\n$$\n\\overline{W}_{A}=p\\,W_{AA}+q\\,W_{AB}=(p+q)(1-c_{A})=1-c_{A},\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{W}_{B}=p\\,W_{AB}+q\\,W_{BB}=p(1-c_{A})+q(1-d\\,q).\n$$\n\nAt a polymorphic equilibrium with both alleles present ($0<q<1$), the necessary condition is equality of marginal fitnesses:\n$$\n\\overline{W}_{A}=\\overline{W}_{B}.\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions and using $p=1-q$ gives:\n$$\n1-c_{A}=(1-q)(1-c_{A})+q(1-d\\,q).\n$$\nSubtracting $(1-c_{A})$ from both sides and simplifying yields:\n$$\n0=-q(1-c_{A})+q-d\\,q^{2}=q\\bigl(c_{A}-d\\,q\\bigr).\n$$\nFor a polymorphic equilibrium with $q>0$, we require\n$$\nc_{A}-d\\,q=0\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad q^{\\ast}=\\frac{c_{A}}{d}.\n$$\nFor coexistence (an internal equilibrium), this requires $0<q^{\\ast}<1$, i.e., $0<c_{A}<d$.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium frequency of allele $B$ is $q^{\\ast}=\\frac{c_{A}}{d}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{c_{A}}{d}}$$", "id": "1956477"}, {"introduction": "Coevolution rarely happens in isolation; it often unfolds across a \"geographic mosaic\" of interacting populations with varying selective pressures. This exercise provides a hands-on model of the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution, where gene flow occurs from a predator-free \"coldspot\" to a coevolutionary \"hotspot.\" By deriving the mean fitness of the prey population at equilibrium, you will explore how gene flow from safe refuges can constrain adaptation in areas where the arms race is intense [@problem_id:1956481].", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of a predator-prey system framed by the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. A prey species inhabits two distinct patches: a large continental \"coldspot\" and a small island \"hotspot\". In the coldspot, the predator is absent, while in the hotspot, the predator is present and actively hunts the prey.\n\nPrey defense against predation is governed by a single genetic locus with two alleles: a dominant allele `D` that confers complete defense, and a recessive allele `S` that leaves the prey susceptible. In the predator-free coldspot, selection acts against the costly defense allele, and over evolutionary time, the `S` allele has become fixed. Thus, the frequency of the `D` allele in the coldspot population is zero.\n\nIn the hotspot, the fitness of prey individuals depends on their genotype as follows:\n- Individuals carrying at least one `D` allele (genotypes `DD` or `DS`) are fully defended but pay a fitness cost `c` for maintaining the defense mechanism. Their fitness is given by `w_D = 1 - c`.\n- Susceptible individuals (genotype `SS`) do not pay this cost, but they suffer from predation. The intensity of predation is frequency-dependent; the predator is more efficient at hunting the more common prey type. The fitness of a susceptible individual is `w_S = 1 - s_p f_S`, where `s_p` is the maximum predation-induced selection coefficient (when susceptibles are the only prey type) and `f_S` is the frequency of the `S` allele in the hotspot prey population.\n\nThe hotspot is a demographic sink that receives a constant, one-way flow of migrants from the coldspot. Each generation, a fraction `m` of the hotspot population is replaced by individuals from the coldspot. The life cycle within the hotspot proceeds in two steps: first, natural selection occurs based on the fitness values defined above, and second, migration occurs.\n\nLet `p_H` be the frequency of the `D` allele in the hotspot. The change in allele frequency due to selection in a single generation can be modeled using the standard population genetics equation:\n$$ \\Delta p_{H, \\text{sel}} = \\frac{p_H(1-p_H)(w_D - w_S)}{\\bar{w}_H} $$\nwhere `\\bar{w}_H` is the mean fitness of the hotspot population.
