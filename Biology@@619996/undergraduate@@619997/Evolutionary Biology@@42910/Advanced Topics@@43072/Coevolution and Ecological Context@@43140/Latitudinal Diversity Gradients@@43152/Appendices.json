This practice challenges you to evaluate an experimental design proposed to test the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG). By critically examining the comparison between a tropical rainforest and a temperate desert [@problem_id:1943639], you will learn to identify a crucial pitfall in ecological research: the confounding of variables, where an unmeasured factor systematically biases the results.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is designing a field study to test the general ecological principle known as the Latitudinal Diversity Gradient (LDG), which posits that species richness is highest near the equator and decreases towards the poles. The student's specific hypothesis is that reptile species richness decreases with increasing latitude.\n\nTo test this, the student proposes comparing two sites:\n1.  A 100-hectare plot within a tropical rainforest in Costa Rica, located at approximately 10° N latitude.\n2.  A 100-hectare plot within a temperate desert in the Great Basin of Nevada, USA, located at approximately 40° N latitude.\n\nAfter conducting a preliminary survey, the student finds 85 species of reptiles in the Costa Rican plot and only 15 species in the Nevada plot. The student concludes that these findings support the LDG. However, this experimental design has a fundamental flaw that invalidates the conclusion.\n\nWhich of the following statements best identifies the primary flaw in the student's experimental design for testing the stated hypothesis?\n\nA. The study's conclusion is premature because a sample size of only two locations is insufficient to establish a global gradient.\n\nB. The study fails to account for the fact that the two sites are in different hemispheres, which have different seasonal patterns.\n\nC. The study design fatally confounds the variable of latitude with the variable of biome type, as it compares a wet, highly productive ecosystem with a dry, low-productivity one.\n\nD. The choice to study reptiles is a poor one, as the LDG is primarily documented in marine invertebrates and birds, not terrestrial ectotherms.\n\nE. The size of the plots (100 hectares) is too small to capture an accurate measure of regional species richness, a problem known as an edge effect.", "solution": "Identify the hypothesis and variables: The stated hypothesis is that reptile species richness decreases with increasing latitude. The independent variable to be tested is latitude, and the dependent variable is reptile species richness. For a valid test of this causal claim, all other influential factors (e.g., biome type, primary productivity, precipitation, temperature regime, habitat structure, historical biogeography) should be held constant or otherwise controlled.\n\nEvaluate the design: The two sites differ not only in latitude (approximately 10 degrees N versus approximately 40 degrees N) but also, critically, in biome: one is a tropical rainforest (wet, highly productive, structurally complex), the other a temperate desert (dry, low productivity, structurally simple). Because biome type strongly influences species richness independently of latitude, the design confounds latitude with biome. Therefore, any observed difference in reptile richness between the two plots cannot be attributed specifically to latitude; it could plausibly be due to differences in productivity, moisture, vegetation structure, or other biome-associated factors.\n\nAssess distractors:\n- A: While using only two locations limits inference about a global gradient, the more fundamental flaw is the confounding of latitude with biome, which invalidates causal attribution to latitude even for this pairwise comparison.\n- B: Both sites are in the Northern Hemisphere, so hemisphere-related seasonality is not the issue.\n- D: Reptiles do exhibit latitudinal diversity patterns; choice of taxon is not inherently flawed.\n- E: Plot size and edge effects are secondary considerations here; the principal invalidating issue is the confounding of key variables.\n\nConclusion: The primary flaw is the confounding of latitude with biome type, making option C correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1943639"}, {"introduction": "Observing that the tropics have \"more species\" is the first step, but ecologists need precise tools to quantify biodiversity.
