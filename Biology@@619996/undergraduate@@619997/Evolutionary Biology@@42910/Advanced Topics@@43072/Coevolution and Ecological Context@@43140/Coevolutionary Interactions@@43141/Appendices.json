We can model these conflicts quantitatively by calculating the fitness associated with different genetic strategies and predicting how allele frequencies change over a generation. This exercise provides a practical application of population genetics to understand the initial response of a host population to a new parasitic threat, highlighting the trade-offs that govern natural selection [@problem_id:1914777].", "problem": "On a remote island, a population of Azure Flycatchers has recently been exposed to a new, invasive brood parasite: the Onyx Cuckoo. The cuckoo lays its eggs in the flycatcher nests. If the host does not remove the foreign egg, the cuckoo chick hatches and outcompetes the host's own brood, resulting in zero reproductive success for the flycatcher from that nest.\n\nThe ability of a flycatcher to identify and eject a cuckoo egg is controlled by a single genetic locus with two alleles, `R` (for recognition) and `r` (for non-recognition). The `R` allele is dominant, meaning individuals with genotypes `RR` or `Rr` can successfully identify and remove cuckoo eggs. Individuals with the `rr` genotype are unable to recognize the foreign eggs.\n\nThere is, however, a drawback to the recognition ability. Birds carrying the `R` allele sometimes make mistakes and eject one of their own eggs. This behavior reduces their overall reproductive success by a factor of 3% compared to a hypothetical bird with perfect recognition and no parasitism.\n\nAt the start of the first breeding season with the cuckoos present, the frequency of the non-recognition allele `r` in the flycatcher population is $0.98$. During this season, it is observed that cuckoos parasitize 40% of all flycatcher nests.\n\nAssuming the flycatcher population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the beginning of the season (before selection by the cuckoos occurs), calculate the frequency of the non-recognition allele, `r`, in the gene pool of the next generation of flycatchers.

This problem demonstrates how to model such a scenario by defining a fitness function that incorporates both the benefits and costs of a defensive chemical compound. By using calculus to find the maximum of this function, you can determine the optimal level of defense that natural selection would favor in a given environment, providing a quantitative look at how organisms adapt to pressures like herbivory [@problem_id:1914749].", "problem": "An invasive plant species, *Invasiva aemulor*, has established populations in a new continent. Ecologists model the fitness of an individual plant based on its investment in a chemical defense compound, measured by its concentration $C$ in units of milligrams per gram of leaf tissue (mg/g).\n\nThe fitness, $W(C)$, is determined by a trade-off between the benefit of deterring herbivores and the metabolic cost of producing the chemical. This relationship is described by the function:\n$$W(C) = \\frac{A C}{B+C} - \\lambda C$$\nwhere:\n- The first term, $\\frac{A C}{B+C}$, represents the benefit component of fitness, where $A$ is the maximum possible fitness benefit from the defense (related to herbivore pressure) and $B$ is the defense concentration at which half the maximum benefit is achieved.\n- The second term, $-\\lambda C$, represents the fitness cost, where $\\lambda$ is a constant representing the metabolic cost per unit of defense concentration.\n\nIn its native range, the plant coevolves with a specialist herbivore, resulting in strong selective pressure for defense.
