By calculating the minimum benefit required, you will develop a quantitative understanding of how such environment-modifying behaviors can be favored by natural selection through the mechanism of ecological inheritance.", "problem": "Consider a simple model of a haploid, asexual organism. A single gene determines a key ecological behavior: allele $N$ causes the parent to construct a protective nest for its offspring, while the alternative allele $n$ does not. The construction of this nest is costly to the parent. The personal reproductive output of a parent with allele $N$ is reduced by a factor $c$, where $0  c  1$, relative to a baseline of 1. However, the offspring that inherit this nest receive an ecological benefit, increasing their own survival to adulthood by a factor $b$, where $b > 0$, relative to a baseline of 1. A parent with allele $n$ incurs no cost (relative reproductive output is 1), and its offspring receive no benefit (relative survival is 1). Assume discrete, non-overlapping generations.

This problem simulates a real-world scenario where you must use experimental data to determine if a fungus is merely surviving in a toxic environment or actively changing it [@problem_id:1950547]. By calculating a bioaccumulation ratio, you will practice the quantitative skills needed to translate a conceptual hypothesis into a testable, data-driven conclusion about an organism's impact on its environment.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is investigating a newly discovered fungus, *Metallophilus accumulator*, which thrives in soils contaminated with the heavy metal Cadmium (Cd). Two competing hypotheses are proposed to explain its survival. The first is that the fungus is merely tolerant, possessing internal mechanisms to neutralize the metal's toxic effects without changing its external concentration. The second hypothesis posits that the fungus is an active niche constructor that bioaccumulates the metal into its biomass, thereby detoxifying the soil in its immediate vicinity.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, a controlled experiment is conducted. A sample of dry soil with a mass of $m_{\\text{soil}} = 2.50$ kg is prepared. The initial concentration of Cadmium in this soil, $C_{\\text{soil}, i}$, is measured to be $125.0$ mg of Cd per kg of dry soil. A small culture of *M. accumulator* is introduced into the soil and allowed to grow. After an extended growth period, the fungal mycelium is carefully harvested and fully separated from the soil. The final dry mass of the harvested fungus is measured to be $m_{\\text{fungus}} = 20.0$ g. A chemical analysis reveals that the total mass of Cadmium absorbed by the fungal biomass is $M_{\\text{Cd, fungus}} = 18.5$ mg.\n\nTo quantitatively evaluate the evidence for niche construction, calculate the bioaccumulation ratio, $R$. This ratio is defined as the final concentration of Cadmium within the fungus (in mg of Cd per kg of fungus) divided by the final concentration of Cadmium remaining in the soil (in mg of Cd per kg of soil).

Using a game theory approach, you will determine the stable equilibrium at which both strategies can coexist, revealing how social interactions can shape the evolution of niche construction.", "problem": "In a population of Richardson's ground squirrels, two heritable behavioral strategies exist for acquiring burrows. 'Diggers' expend energy to construct new burrows, a form of niche construction. 'Non-diggers' do not dig, instead seeking to occupy existing burrows. The reproductive success (fitness) of an individual depends on its own strategy and the strategy of the squirrel it interacts with over a contested resource. The fitness gains from these interactions are described as follows:\n\n*   When a Digger interacts with another Digger, high density leads to increased predation risk and resource competition. Each Digger successfully builds a burrow, gaining a benefit $B$, but incurs both a digging cost $C$ and a competition cost $C_{\\text{comp}}$. The net fitness gain is $B - C - C_{\\text{comp}}$.\n*   When a Digger interacts with a Non-digger, the Digger secures its self-made burrow without local competition from another digger. The net fitness gain is $B - C$.\n*   When a Non-digger interacts with a Digger, the Non-digger attempts to take over the Digger's burrow. The Non-digger's average fitness gain from such encounters is $B$, as it can acquire a prime burrow without paying any digging costs itself.\n*   When a Non-digger interacts with another Non-digger, they must compete for the scarce, low-quality abandoned burrows left from previous seasons. The expected fitness gain for each from this interaction is a low value, $B_{\\text{old}}$.\n\nIn this system, selection is frequency-dependent, leading to a stable equilibrium where both strategies coexist.
