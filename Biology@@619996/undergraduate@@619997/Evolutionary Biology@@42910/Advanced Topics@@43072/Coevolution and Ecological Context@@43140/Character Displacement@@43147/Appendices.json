This practice will hone your ability to interpret population-level data and form a valid evolutionary hypothesis.", "id": "1834483", "problem": "An ecologist is studying acoustic communication in two closely related species of tree frogs, designated Species Alpha and Species Beta. The primary component of their mating call is a single-note \"peep\" characterized by its dominant frequency. The ecologist samples male frogs from three distinct geographic regions: a region where only Species Alpha is found (allopatry Alpha), a region where only Species Beta is found (allopatry Beta), and a region where both species coexist (sympatry). The mean and standard deviation of the dominant call frequency (in kilohertz, kHz) were recorded for a large sample of males in each population.\n\nThe collected data are as follows:\n-   **Species Alpha in allopatry:** Mean frequency = 2.40 kHz, Standard Deviation = 0.25 kHz.\n-   **Species Beta in allopatry:** Mean frequency = 2.65 kHz, Standard Deviation = 0.25 kHz.\n-   **Species Alpha in sympatry:** Mean frequency = 2.15 kHz, Standard Deviation = 0.15 kHz.\n-   **Species Beta in sympatry:** Mean frequency = 2.90 kHz, Standard Deviation = 0.15 kHz.\n\nBased on this data, which of the following ecological phenomena provides the most likely explanation for the observed pattern of call frequencies in the sympatric zone?\n\nA. Competitive exclusion, where Species Beta is outcompeting Species Alpha for acoustic space, leading to the local extinction of Species Alpha.\nB.

Founder effect, where the sympatric populations were established by individuals with, by chance, different call frequencies from the allopatric source populations.\nE. Phenotypic plasticity, where individual frogs adjust their call frequency in real-time based on the calls they hear around them, without any underlying genetic change.\n\n", "solution": "We begin by quantifying the divergence in dominant call frequency between the two species in allopatry versus sympatry.\n\nUsing the given means:\n- Allopatry: Species Alpha mean is 2.40 kHz and Species Beta mean is 2.65 kHz. The between-species difference is\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{all}} = 2.65 - 2.40 = 0.25 \\text{ kHz}.\n$$\n- Sympatry: Species Alpha mean is 2.15 kHz and Species Beta mean is 2.90 kHz. The between-species difference is\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{sym}} = 2.90 - 2.15 = 0.75 \\text{ kHz}.\n$$\n\nThus, the between-species divergence in frequency is larger in sympatry than in allopatry, i.e., $\\Delta_{\\text{sym}} > \\Delta_{\\text{all}}$. Additionally, the within-species standard deviations are lower in sympatry (0.15 kHz) than in allopatry (0.25 kHz) for both species, which is consistent with stronger stabilizing selection around distinct, more separated optima in sympatry.\n\nPrinciple: Reproductive character displacement (RCD) predicts that traits involved in mate recognition and assortative mating (such as mating calls) diverge more in sympatry than in allopatry to reduce costly reproductive interference or hybridization. This results in increased interspecific differences in mating signals specifically where the species co-occur, often accompanied by reduced within-population variance due to selection.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\n- Option A (Competitive exclusion): This predicts local exclusion of one species, not stable coexistence with increased divergence of mating signals. The data show both species present in sympatry with divergent calls, contradicting exclusion.\n\n- Option B (Reproductive character displacement): This directly matches the pattern: traits central to mate recognition (call frequency) diverge more in sympatry than in allopatry, and reduced standard deviations indicate selection for distinct signal optima to minimize mating interference or hybridization.\n\n- Option C (Ecological character displacement): This applies to divergence in resource-use traits to reduce interspecific competition for food or habitat. Dominant call frequency is a mating signal, not a resource-use trait; the observed pattern targets reproductive isolation rather than resource partitioning.\n\n- Option D (Founder effect): Drift-based shifts would be random in direction and unlikely to produce coordinated divergence in opposite directions for the two species in the same region, and would not predict reduced within-population variance. The systematic, functionally relevant divergence and reduced standard deviations point to selection, not drift.\n\n- Option E (Phenotypic plasticity): Real-time individual adjustment would likely increase within-population variance or produce context-dependent variability rather than consistent population means with reduced variance. Moreover, dominant call frequency in frogs is generally constrained by morphology and is not typically adjusted plastically to this extent.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is reproductive character displacement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}, {"introduction": "Observing a difference between species is not enough; a good scientist must rule out alternative explanations. In biology, many traits scale with body size, a phenomenon known as allometry, which can create apparent differences that are not the result of direct selection on the trait itself. This problem challenges you to think like a skeptical ecologist by evaluating a claim of character displacement in cichlid fish jaws [@problem_id:1834450]. By calculating a displacement index that corrects for allometry, you will learn a crucial skill: how to rigorously test a hypothesis by controlling for confounding variables.", "id": "1834450", "problem": "An ecologist is studying resource competition between two species of cichlid fish, the Emerald Cichlid (*Cichla aequa*) and the Ruby Cichlid (*Cichla differa*), in a series of isolated crater lakes. These species feed on gastropods, using their pharyngeal jaws to crush the shells. The researcher hypothesizes that where the two species coexist (in sympatry), they exhibit character displacement in pharyngeal jaw morphology to partition the food resource, with one species evolving larger jaws for harder-shelled snails and the other smaller jaws for softer-shelled snails.\n\nFrom extensive sampling in allopatric lakes (where only one species is present), the baseline allometric relationship between standard body length ($L$, in cm) and pharyngeal jaw width ($J$, in mm) for each species has been firmly established. The relationships, linearized by a natural logarithm transformation, are:\n\nFor *Cichla aequa*: $\\ln(J) = -0.90 + 1.20 \\ln(L)$\nFor *Cichla differa*: $\\ln(J) = -0.70 + 1.20 \\ln(L)$\n\nThe researcher then collects a sample of fish from a specific sympatric lake and measures their average body lengths and jaw widths.

You are tasked with critically evaluating this claim. To do so, you must calculate a dimensionless \"displacement index,\" $D$, which quantifies the deviation of the observed jaw size ratio from the ratio that would be expected based purely on the species' allometry and their observed body sizes. The index is defined as:\n\n$$D = \\frac{J_{d,obs}/J_{a,obs}}{J_{d,exp}/J_{a,exp}}$$\n\nwhere the subscript 'a' refers to *C. aequa* and 'd' refers to *C. differa*. The subscript 'obs' indicates the observed mean values from the sympatric lake, and 'exp' indicates the expected mean values calculated from the established allometric equations using the observed mean body lengths. A value of $D=1$ implies that the difference in jaw size is entirely explained by allometry and body size differences, while a value significantly greater than 1 would support the hypothesis of character displacement.\n\nCalculate the value of the displacement index $D$.

The effectiveness of each bacterial species at resisting these peptides is determined by a single quantitative trait, the \"resistance focus\" $\\phi$, which ranges from 0 to 1. A bacterium with $\\phi=0$ is a pure specialist, highly resistant to Peptide A but very susceptible to Peptide B. A bacterium with $\\phi=1$ is a pure specialist for Peptide B.
