This first practice [@problem_id:1949848] asks you to think like an evolutionary ecologist trying to classify a newly discovered symbiotic relationship. By evaluating different hypothetical experimental findings, you will practice distinguishing between suggestive evidence, plausible mechanisms, and the direct fitness measurements required to definitively categorize an interaction as mutualistic.", "problem": "In the aphotic zone of the deep ocean, the anglerfish species *Acutus-esca profundus* possesses a specialized organ on its head called an esca. This esca serves as a lure for prey and is colonized by a single species of bioluminescent bacterium, *Candidatus luminosus*. The fish provides a protected, nutrient-rich environment within the esca where the bacteria can thrive. The light produced by the dense bacterial colony is used by the fish to attract smaller organisms, which it then consumes. This interaction is clearly beneficial to the fish.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist wishes to determine if this symbiotic relationship is a mutualism (both partners benefit) or a commensalism (the fish benefits, the bacteria are unaffected). Which of the following experimental findings would provide the most definitive evidence to classify the relationship as mutualistic?\n\nA. Genetic analysis reveals that *Candidatus luminosus* lacks the genes to synthesize several essential amino acids that are abundant in the esca, making it an obligate symbiont unable to survive in the open ocean.\n\nB. Tracking experiments show that anglerfish with brighter, more densely populated escas have a significantly higher prey capture rate than fish with dimmer escas.\n\nC. Isotopic labeling of nutrients reveals that the fish actively secretes metabolic byproducts into the esca, which serve as the primary carbon source for the bacteria.\n\nD. A comparative study shows that the genome of *Candidatus luminosus* is 70% smaller than that of its closest free-living, non-bioluminescent bacterial relatives.\n\nE. In a controlled environment, the population growth rate of the bacteria inside the esca is measured to be significantly higher within the 24-hour period following the host fish's successful consumption of a prey item, compared to periods of fasting.", "solution": "Define the classification criteria. Mutualism requires that both partners receive a fitness benefit from the interaction (e.g., increased survival, growth, or reproduction) relative to not interacting. Commensalism, as framed here, would mean the fish benefits while the bacteria experience no change in fitness.\n\nApply the problem’s premise. The statement already establishes that the fish benefits from bacterial light. Therefore, to classify the relationship as mutualistic rather than commensal, the decisive evidence must show a fitness benefit to the bacteria attributable to the association with the host.\n\nEvaluate each option for whether it provides direct, fitness-relevant evidence that the bacteria benefit from the host:\n- Option A: Loss of genes for essential amino acids and inability to survive in the open ocean implies obligate dependence on the esca environment for survival. While strongly suggestive that the host provides an essential benefit (survival), it is inferential and evolutionary in nature; it does not directly measure a present-day fitness outcome attributable to host behavior or resource flow. It is consistent with mutualism but could also be consistent with other obligate associations; it is not the most direct fitness demonstration.\n- Option B: Demonstrates enhanced fish fitness (higher prey capture) with brighter escas, but provides no evidence about bacterial fitness. This cannot distinguish mutualism from commensalism.\n- Option C: Isotopic tracing shows the host provides metabolic byproducts as the primary carbon source for bacteria, indicating resource transfer from fish to bacteria. This shows a plausible benefit but does not directly quantify a fitness outcome (e.g., growth, reproduction) for the bacteria; resource use alone may not be definitive for fitness advantage relative to alternatives.\n- Option D: Genome reduction is a general signature of long-term symbiosis and dependence but is not direct evidence of a current fitness benefit to the bacteria arising from host association.\n- Option E: Directly measures a fitness proxy for the bacteria (population growth rate) and shows that it increases following host prey capture compared to fasting periods. This links host success to increased bacterial growth, demonstrating a concrete fitness benefit to the bacteria from the association. Given that the fish benefit is already established, this constitutes the most definitive evidence of mutualism.\n\nConclusion. The most definitive evidence is provided by Option E because it directly demonstrates that the bacteria gain a fitness benefit due to the host’s success, completing the criterion for mutualism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1949848"}, {"introduction": "For a mutualistic trait to evolve and persist, the fitness benefits gained from the interaction must exceed the costs of maintaining it. This practice [@problem_id:1949861] distills this core principle into a simple but powerful mathematical model, treating the evolution of cooperation as an economic problem. By calculating the minimum frequency of cooperative partners needed for a mutualistic strategy to invade a population, you will gain a quantitative understanding of the threshold conditions that govern the emergence of cooperation.", "problem": "In an evolutionary model of a plant-pollinator relationship, a plant species can adopt one of two heritable strategies: 'Cooperate' by investing energy to produce nectar, or 'Defect' by not producing nectar. This plant is pollinated by an insect species whose population consists of two types of individuals with distinct behaviors: 'Cooperators' who actively visit these plants to forage (and thus act as pollinators), and 'Defectors' who do not visit the plants.\n\nThe fitness of a plant is determined by the costs and benefits of its strategy. We can define a simplified fitness model with the following parameters:\n- The baseline fitness for any plant is normalized to zero.\n- The production of nectar incurs a fitness cost, $c$.\n- Successful pollination by a visiting insect provides a fitness benefit, $b$.\n- The 'Cooperating' pollinators in this model are discerning; they only visit and successfully pollinate flowers that produce nectar. Therefore, a 'Defecting' plant (no nectar) receives no pollination benefit, even when 'Cooperating' insects are present.\n\nConsider a large plant population composed entirely of 'Defectors'. A rare mutant 'Cooperating' plant appears. This plant exists in an environment where the pollinator population has a constant fraction, $x$, of 'Cooperating' insects, and a fraction, $(1-x)$, of 'Defecting' insects.\n\nThe 'Cooperate' strategy can successfully invade and spread through the plant population if the expected fitness of a 'Cooperator' plant is strictly greater than the expected fitness of a resident 'Defector' plant. Given a pollination benefit $b = 1.25$ fitness units and a nectar production cost $c = 0.40$ fitness units, which of the following conditions on the fraction of 'Cooperating' pollinators, $x$, must be met?\n\nA. $x > 0.25$\n\nB. $x > 0.32$\n\nC. $x > 0.40$\n\nD. $x > 1.25$\n\nE. $x  0.32$", "solution": "Let $W_{C}$ denote the expected fitness of a rare mutant plant that chooses the 'Cooperate' strategy and $W_{D}$ the expected fitness of a resident 'Defector' plant.\n\nBy the problem setup:\n- A 'Cooperator' plant pays nectar cost $c$ and receives pollination benefit $b$ only from 'Cooperating' insects, which occur at fraction $x$. Under the simplest proportional visitation assumption, the expected benefit is $xb$. Thus,\n$$\nW_{C}=xb-c.\n$$\n- A 'Defector' plant pays no cost and receives no benefit because cooperating insects do not visit non-nectar plants, so\n$$\nW_{D}=0.\n$$\n\nThe invasion condition is that the mutant 'Cooperate' strategy has strictly greater expected fitness than the resident 'Defect' strategy:\n$$\nW_{C}W_{D}\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad xb-c0\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad x\\frac{c}{b}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $b=1.25$ and $c=0.40$,\n$$\n\\frac{c}{b}=\\frac{0.40}{1.25}=\\frac{40}{125}=\\frac{8}{25}=0.32,\n$$\nso the condition becomes $x0.32$, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1949861"}, {"introduction": "Mutualistic strategies can be broadly categorized as specialist or generalist, creating a fundamental evolutionary trade-off between the efficiency of a specialized partnership and the resilience of a broad one. This final exercise [@problem_id:1949872] explores the profound ecological consequences of this trade-off through a dynamic thought experiment. By predicting the fates of two plant species after a sudden environmental shock, you will apply your understanding of mutualism to see how a species' evolutionary strategy can determine its long-term survival or vulnerability to extinction.", "problem": "In an isolated mountain ecosystem, two closely related plant species, *Petalidium astra* and *Petalidium multiplex*, have evolved different pollination strategies. *Petalidium astra* is a specialist; it has evolved a deep, tubular floral structure and a unique nectar chemistry that exclusively attracts a single species of hawk moth, *Noctua proboscis*. This co-evolution has resulted in extremely high pollination efficiency, with nearly every flower visited by the moth being successfully pollinated. In contrast, *Petalidium multiplex* is a generalist; it has open, bowl-shaped flowers that are visited and pollinated by a wide variety of local insects, including bees, flies, and beetles. While the pollination success rate from any single insect visit is much lower for *P. multiplex* than for *P. astra*, the sheer number and diversity of its visitors ensure consistent seed production.\n\nA new, highly virulent, and species-specific pathogen is accidentally introduced into the ecosystem and causes a catastrophic decline in the population of the hawk moth, *Noctua proboscis*, driving it to the brink of local extinction within two years.\n\nBased on the principles of evolutionary biology, what is the most likely immediate consequence for the two plant populations in the generations that follow this event?\n\nA. *Petalidium astra* will experience a severe decline in reproductive success and face a high risk of local extinction, while the reproductive output of *Petalidium multiplex* will remain relatively stable.\n\nB. Both plant species will suffer a similar decline in population as the overall pollinator abundance in the ecosystem has been disrupted.\n\nC. *Petalidium astra* will rapidly evolve a different flower morphology to attract the generalist pollinators that visit *Petalidium multiplex*.\n\nD. *Petalidium multiplex* will be more negatively affected than *P. astra*, as its low-efficiency pollination system cannot withstand the loss of any contributing pollinator group.\n\nE. The hawk moth *Noctua proboscis* will quickly develop immunity to the pathogen, allowing the *Petalidium astra* population to recover before it suffers any significant consequences.", "solution": "We identify the key biological relationships and constraints. *Petalidium astra* is a specialist whose floral morphology and nectar chemistry have coevolved to match a single pollinator, the hawk moth *Noctua proboscis*. This implies a near-exclusive dependency: successful outcross pollination for *P. astra* is functionally contingent on the presence of *N. proboscis*. *Petalidium multiplex* is a generalist with open flowers serviced by many insect taxa, implying redundancy in pollinator function; its reproductive output is buffered by diversity of pollinator visitors.\n\nA species-specific, highly virulent pathogen drives *N. proboscis* to the brink of local extinction. The immediate ecological consequence is a drastic reduction in the availability of the only effective pollinator for *P. astra*. Given the tight morphological and behavioral fit typical of specialized plant–pollinator mutualisms, other local insects are unlikely to compensate in the short term; thus *P. astra*’s pollination rate, seed set, and recruitment will collapse. This creates a high risk of rapid demographic decline and potential local extinction, potentially exacerbated by Allee effects if reproduction requires cross-pollination and autonomous selfing or vegetative reproduction is insufficient.\n\nIn contrast, *P. multiplex* relies on a broad suite of pollinators. The loss of a single pollinator species (even if locally abundant) is unlikely to cause a comparable collapse because remaining pollinator groups can continue to service flowers, maintaining relatively stable reproductive output due to functional redundancy and network robustness.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states that *P. astra* will experience severe reproductive decline and high local extinction risk, while *P. multiplex* remains relatively stable due to its generalist strategy.\n- B is incorrect because the disruption is specific to one pollinator species; the generalist’s many other pollinators remain.\n- C is implausible on immediate generational timescales; rapid evolution of a fundamentally different floral morphology is constrained by genetic variation, developmental constraints, and would not reliably occur before demographic collapse.\n- D reverses the expected robustness; generalists are typically more resilient to the loss of any one pollinator group.\n- E assumes rapid host evolution in the moth; such adaptation is uncertain and, even if possible, unlikely to occur fast enough to prevent immediate reproductive failure in *P. astra*.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immediate consequence is described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1949872"}]}
