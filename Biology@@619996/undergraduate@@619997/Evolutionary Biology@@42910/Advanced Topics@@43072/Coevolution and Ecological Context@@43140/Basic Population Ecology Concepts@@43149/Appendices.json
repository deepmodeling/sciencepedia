Ecologists use life tables to organize the survival and reproductive data of a population, often by tracking a cohort of individuals born at the same time. This exercise demonstrates how to calculate the fundamental parameter of age-specific survivorship ($l_x$) directly from field data, a foundational skill for constructing and interpreting demographic models. [@problem_id:1910809]", "problem": "A team of ecologists is conducting a long-term study on the population dynamics of the Eastern Gray Squirrel (*Sciurus carolinensis*) in a large, isolated woodland reserve. As part of their research to construct a life table for this population, they initiated a cohort study. In the spring of the first year, they identified and placed uniquely numbered tags on a cohort of 1000 newborn squirrels just as they began to forage independently.\n\nExactly one year later, the team performed a comprehensive survey of the reserve. Through a combination of live-trapping and radio-tracking of the tagged animals, they were able to ascertain the status of every individual in the original cohort. The results of the survey showed that 750 of the originally tagged squirrels were still alive.\n\nBased on these findings, calculate the age-specific survivorship for this cohort at age 1. Express your answer as a single decimal value.", "solution": "Define age-specific survivorship at age $x$ as $l_{x} = \\frac{n_{x}}{n_{0}}$, where $n_{0}$ is the initial cohort size and $n_{x}$ is the number alive at age $x$.\n\nGiven $n_{0} = 1000$ and $n_{1} = 750$, compute\n$$\nl_{1} = \\frac{n_{1}}{n_{0}} = \\frac{750}{1000} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the age-specific survivorship at age $1$ is $0.75$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.75}$$", "id": "1910809"}, {"introduction": "Populations rarely grow without limits; they are constrained by resource availability and other density-dependent factors. The logistic growth model provides a more realistic description of population dynamics by incorporating the concept of carrying capacity ($K$), the maximum population size an environment can sustain.

The total area of the sanctuary that provides a suitable habitat for this grass is limited. The ecologist finds that the expansion of the area, $N$, covered by the grass can be accurately modeled by the logistic growth equation. Through field measurements, the intrinsic rate of increase, $r$, for this species is determined to be $0.15$ per year. The carrying capacity, $K$, which is the maximum area the grass can colonize within the sanctuary, is estimated to be $50.0$ hectares.\n\nCalculate the current population growth rate ($dN/dt$) for the grass at a moment when it covers an area of $12.0$ hectares.

Leslie matrices are a powerful tool for modeling these age-structured populations, where fecundity and survival rates vary across different life stages.

The population dynamics can be modeled using a Leslie matrix, where the top row represents the fertility (average number of new larvae produced per individual in each age class) and the sub-diagonal represents the survival probability from one age class to the next.\n\nInitially, the population dynamics are described by the Leslie matrix $L_1$:\n$$\nL_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & F_3 \\\\ P_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & P_2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwith initial parameters: adult fecundity $F_3 = 84$, larval survival probability $P_1 = 0.6$, and nymph survival probability $P_2 = 0.75$.\n\nA conservation initiative is implemented to protect the stonefly. Post-initiative monitoring reveals changes in the life history traits, resulting in a new Leslie matrix $L_2$.
