The two islands are identical in area, climate, and distance from the mainland. However, their origins are different. Ignis is a new volcanic island that emerged from the sea, initially completely devoid of life. Tectonia is a continental fragment that was separated from the mainland by a sudden geological event, carrying with it a sample of the continent's flora and fauna.\n\nBased on the principles of island biogeography, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected changes in the number of terrestrial vertebrate species on each island over a long period of time, starting from the moment of their formation or separation?\n\nA. Ignis begins with zero species and its species richness increases towards an equilibrium. Tectonia begins with a high number of species that subsequently decreases towards a lower equilibrium.\n\nB. Both Ignis and Tectonia begin with zero species, but species richness on Tectonia increases at a much faster rate than on Ignis.\n\nC.

Let $I(S)$ be the immigration rate and $E(S)$ the extinction rate as functions of $S$. The governing relation is\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = I(S) - E(S).\n$$\nCore qualitative properties of these functions are\n$$\nI'(S) < 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad E'(S) > 0,\n$$\nreflecting that immigration declines as the island’s biota saturates and extinction rises with more coexisting species. The equilibrium species richness $S^{\\ast}$ satisfies\n$$\nI(S^{\\ast}) = E(S^{\\ast}).\n$$\nBecause Ignis and Tectonia are identical in area, climate, and distance to the mainland, the immigration and extinction functions are the same for both, and hence both islands share the same equilibrium $S^{\\ast}$. Their different origins produce different initial conditions.\n\nFor Ignis (a new volcanic island), the initial condition is that it begins devoid of terrestrial vertebrates:\n$$\nS(0) = 0.\n$$\nAt $S=0$, immigration is maximal and extinction minimal, so\n$$\nI(0) > E(0) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{dS}{dt} \\bigg|_{t=0} > 0,\n$$\nand $S(t)$ increases monotonically toward $S^{\\ast}$ as long as $I(S) > E(S)$, approaching equilibrium when $I(S)=E(S)$.\n\nFor Tectonia (a continental fragment), the initial condition is that it carries a sample of mainland species, so it begins with a high $S(0)=S_{\\text{init}}$. Given identical area and isolation to Ignis, the long-term equilibrium $S^{\\ast}$ is lower than typical mainland richness; thus it is expected that\n$$\nS_{\\text{init}} > S^{\\ast}.\n$$\nAt such high $S$, immigration is low and extinction is high, so\n$$\nI(S_{\\text{init}}) < E(S_{\\text{init}}) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{dS}{dt} \\bigg|_{t=0} < 0,\n$$\nand $S(t)$ decreases (faunal relaxation) toward $S^{\\ast}$. There is no expectation, absent changes in area or isolation, that $S(t)$ would return to the original mainland-level richness.\n\nTherefore:\n- Ignis starts at zero species and increases toward an equilibrium.\n- Tectonia starts with a high number of species and decreases toward a lower equilibrium.\n\nThis pattern matches option A and contradicts the alternatives: B is false because Tectonia does not start at zero; C is false because Tectonia will not remain constant but will relax downward; D is false because Ignis does not begin with a high number of species; E is false because Tectonia will not rebound to its original (continental) level without changes to isolation or area.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1941809"}, {"introduction": "The equilibrium state of an island ecosystem is determined by two key geographical factors: its area and its degree of isolation. This exercise challenges you to apply the core principles of the MacArthur-Wilson model to predict how these factors influence not just species richness, but also the rate of species turnover. Understanding turnover is crucial, as it reflects the dynamism and stability of the island's biological community [@problem_id:1861740].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying a set of four oceanic islands, labeled W, X, Y, and Z, all located at a similar latitude and having comparable climates.

This practice focuses on the species-area relationship, often expressed as the power law $S = cA^z$, one of ecology's most fundamental patterns. By performing a direct calculation, you will see how this elegant formula, derived from island biogeography principles, allows us to make concrete predictions about how changes in habitat area impact biodiversity [@problem_id:2583905].", "problem": "Two oceanic islands share the same regional species pool, climatic regime, and isolation from the mainland. Let the areas of the two islands be $A_1$ and $A_2$, with $A_1=100\\,\\mathrm{km}^2$ and $A_2=1600\\,\\mathrm{km}^2$. Assume the Equilibrium Theory of Island Biogeography (ETIB) applies, and adopt the following widely observed foundations: (i) with isolation held constant, equilibrium species richness $S$ increases in direct proportion to the number of distinct microhabitat types $H$ available on an island; and (ii) microhabitat richness scales with island area as $H = k A^{z}$ for some constant $k>0$ and exponent $z$ with $0<z<1$. \n\nUsing only these foundations, derive an expression for the ratio of equilibrium species richness between the two islands, $S_2/S_1$, in terms of $A_1$, $A_2$, and $z$. Then evaluate this ratio for $z=0.25$, $A_1=100\\,\\mathrm{km}^2$, and $A_2=1600\\,\\mathrm{km}^2$. Provide your final answer as an exact number with no units. The ratio is dimensionless; areas are given in $\\mathrm{km}^2$.", "solution": "The problem provides two foundational relationships. First, the equilibrium species richness, $S$, is directly proportional to the number of available microhabitat types, $H$. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$S = c_{1} H$$\nwhere $c_{1}$ is a constant of proportionality. The problem states that the two islands share the same regional species pool and climatic regime, which implies that this constant $c_{1}$ is identical for both islands.\n\nSecond, the richness of microhabitats, $H$, scales as a power function of the island's area, $A$. This is given by the equation:\n$$H = k A^{z}$$\nwhere $k$ is a positive constant and the exponent $z$ is in the range $0 < z < 1$.\n\nWe can combine these two foundations by substituting the expression for $H$ into the expression for $S$:\n$$S = c_{1} (k A^{z}) = (c_{1}k) A^{z}$$\nLet us define a new constant, $c = c_{1}k$. As $c_{1}$ and $k$ are constants for the given biogeographic context, $c$ is also a constant. The relationship between species richness and area is thus the standard species-area model:\n$$S = c A^{z}$$\nThis equation holds for both islands. Let $S_1$ and $A_1$ be the species richness and area of the first island, and $S_2$ and $A_2$ be the species richness and area of the second island. We can write the specific equations for each:\n$$S_1 = c A_1^z$$\n$$S_2 = c A_2^z$$\nThe constant $c$ is the same in both equations because the islands are stated to share the same regional species pool and climatic regime, and the constant $k$ in the habitat scaling law relates to the general nature of the terrain, which we assume is structurally similar between islands.\n\nThe primary task is to find the ratio of equilibrium species richness, $\\frac{S_2}{S_1}$. We construct this ratio by dividing the second equation by the first:\n$$\\frac{S_2}{S_1} = \\frac{c A_2^z}{c A_1^z}$$\nThe constant $c$ cancels, yielding the general expression for the ratio in terms of the island areas and the scaling exponent:\n$$\\frac{S_2}{S_1} = \\frac{A_2^z}{A_1^z} = \\left(\\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right)^z$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nThe second task is to evaluate this ratio using the provided numerical values: $A_1 = 100\\,\\mathrm{km}^2$, $A_2 = 1600\\,\\mathrm{km}^2$, and $z = 0.25$.\nFirst, we calculate the ratio of the areas:\n$$\\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \\frac{1600}{100} = 16$$\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n\nNext, we substitute this value and the value of $z$ into our derived expression. The exponent is $z = 0.25$, which is equivalent to the fraction $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n$$\\frac{S_2}{S_1} = (16)^{0.25} = (16)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$$\nThis is the fourth root of $16$. We find the number which, when raised to the power of $4$, equals $16$.\nSince $2^4 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$, the fourth root of $16$ is $2$.\n$$\\frac{S_2}{S_1} = 2$$\nThus, the equilibrium species richness on the larger island is predicted to be exactly twice that of the smaller island under the given model and parameters.
