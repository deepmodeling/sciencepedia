{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A cornerstone of host-parasite coevolution is the gene-for-gene model, which describes a direct genetic correspondence between a host's ability to resist and a parasite's ability to infect. This practice asks you to apply principles of population genetics, specifically the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, to quantify the outcomes of such interactions at a population level. By calculating the proportion of successful infections, you will gain a tangible understanding of how allele frequencies in both host and parasite populations collectively determine the ecological landscape of disease [@problem_id:1938917].", "problem": "In an ecological study of coevolution, a population of a wild grass (the host) is observed to be in a dynamic relationship with a pathogenic rust fungus (the parasite). The interaction is governed by a simple gene-for-gene model involving a single locus in each species.\n\nIn the host plant, a single locus with two alleles determines resistance. The allele `R` is dominant and codes for a receptor protein, while the allele `r` is recessive and does not produce a functional receptor.\n\nIn the parasite fungus, a single locus with two alleles determines its ability to be detected. The allele `A` is dominant and codes for an avirulence signal protein, while the allele `a` is recessive and does not produce this signal protein.\n\nA successful host defense (i.e., resistance) occurs if and only if a host plant possesses at least one `R` allele to produce the receptor, and the infecting fungus possesses at least one `A` allele to produce the corresponding signal. All other combinations of host and parasite genotypes result in a successful infection.\n\nField surveys indicate that both populations are large, diploid, and can be modeled as being in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. The frequency of the resistance allele `R` in the host population is 0.75. The frequency of the avirulence allele `A` in the parasite population is 0.40.\n\nAssuming that any host is equally likely to be encountered by any parasite, calculate the overall proportion of random encounters that will result in a successful infection for the parasite. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the overall proportion of encounters that result in a successful infection. A successful infection occurs in any scenario except for the specific case of resistance. Therefore, it is easier to first calculate the probability of resistance, $P(\\text{Resistance})$, and then find the probability of infection, $P(\\text{Infection})$, using the relationship $P(\\text{Infection}) = 1 - P(\\text{Resistance})$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, resistance occurs if and only if the host has a resistant genotype (at least one $R$ allele) AND the parasite has an avirulent genotype (at least one $A$ allele). Since the encounters are random, the probabilities of the host and parasite genotypes are independent.\nTherefore, $P(\\text{Resistance}) = P(\\text{Host is resistant}) \\times P(\\text{Parasite is avirulent})$.\n\nLet's calculate each of these probabilities.\n\nFirst, consider the host population.\nLet $p_H$ be the frequency of the $R$ allele and $q_H$ be the frequency of the $r$ allele.\nWe are given $p_H = f(R) = 0.75$.\nSince there are only two alleles, $q_H = f(r) = 1 - p_H = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$.\n\nThe host is resistant if its genotype is $RR$ or $Rr$. The host is susceptible only if its genotype is $rr$. Since the population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), we can calculate the frequency of the susceptible genotype $rr$ as $f(rr) = q_H^2$.\nThe probability that a randomly chosen host is resistant, $P(\\text{Host is resistant})$, is $1 - f(rr)$.\nSymbolically, $P(\\text{Host is resistant}) = 1 - q_H^2$.\nSubstituting the value of $q_H$:\n$P(\\text{Host is resistant}) = 1 - (0.25)^2 = 1 - 0.0625 = 0.9375$.\n\nNext, consider the parasite population.\nLet $p_P$ be the frequency of the $A$ allele and $q_P$ be the frequency of the $a$ allele.\nWe are given $p_P = f(A) = 0.40$.\nSince there are only two alleles, $q_P = f(a) = 1 - p_P = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\n\nThe parasite is avirulent (i.e., it can be detected by a resistant host) if its genotype is $AA$ or $Aa$. The parasite is virulent (stealthy) if its genotype is $aa$. Since the population is in HWE, the frequency of the virulent genotype $aa$ is $f(aa) = q_P^2$.\nThe probability that a randomly chosen parasite is avirulent, $P(\\text{Parasite is avirulent})$, is $1 - f(aa)$.\nSymbolically, $P(\\text{Parasite is avirulent}) = 1 - q_P^2$.\nSubstituting the value of $q_P$:\n$P(\\text{Parasite is avirulent}) = 1 - (0.60)^2 = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64$.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of a resistant interaction.\n$P(\\text{Resistance}) = P(\\text{Host is resistant}) \\times P(\\text{Parasite is avirulent})$\n$P(\\text{Resistance}) = (1 - q_H^2) \\times (1 - q_P^2)$\n$P(\\text{Resistance}) = 0.9375 \\times 0.64 = 0.60$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability of a successful infection.\n$P(\\text{Infection}) = 1 - P(\\text{Resistance})$\n$P(\\text{Infection}) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$.\n\nThe question asks for the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$0.40$ can be written as $0.4000$ to satisfy this requirement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4000}$$", "id": "1938917"}, {"introduction": "Host defenses are not limited to simply blocking infection. This problem introduces a critical distinction between two major defense strategies: resistance and tolerance. You will model a scenario where hosts can evolve either to prevent infection entirely (resistance) at a constant cost, or to endure infection without suffering harm (tolerance) at a cost that depends on encountering the parasite. By deriving the critical parasite prevalence at which these two strategies yield equal fitness, this exercise demonstrates how ecological context can determine the evolutionary trajectory of host defenses [@problem_id:1938913].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying a host population that is under selective pressure from a prevalent parasite. The parasite is present in the environment, and any given host individual encounters and becomes infected by it with a probability $p$, known as the parasite prevalence. In response to this threat, two distinct defensive strategies have been observed in the host population: resistance and tolerance.\n\nThe fitness of individuals is modeled as follows, with a baseline fitness normalized to 1 in the absence of any costs or infection:\n\n1.  **Resistant Individuals**: These individuals have a specialized immune system that renders them completely immune to the parasite. This strategy comes with a significant metabolic burden, resulting in a constant, constitutive fitness cost $c_r$. Therefore, the fitness of a resistant individual is always $1 - c_r$, regardless of the parasite prevalence $p$.\n\n2.  **Tolerant Individuals**: These individuals do not prevent infection. They have no constitutive fitness cost when uninfected, and thus their fitness is 1 in that state. However, if they become infected (which occurs with probability $p$), they mount a tolerance response. This response completely neutralizes the parasite's harmful effects on their health, but activating this response incurs a fitness cost $c_t$. Consequently, an infected tolerant individual has a fitness of $1 - c_t$.\n\nAssume that the costs $c_r$ and $c_t$ are positive and less than 1. The choice between these two strategies depends on the epidemiological landscape.\n\nDerive an expression for the critical parasite prevalence, $p_{crit}$, at which the average fitness of a resistant individual is exactly equal to the average fitness of a tolerant individual. Express your answer in terms of $c_r$ and $c_t$.", "solution": "Let the average fitness of a resistant individual be denoted by $W_{r}$ and that of a tolerant individual by $W_{t}$.\n\nBy definition, resistant individuals always pay the constitutive cost $c_{r}$, regardless of infection prevalence. Therefore,\n$$\nW_{r} = 1 - c_{r}.\n$$\n\nTolerant individuals pay no cost when uninfected (probability $1 - p$) and pay cost $c_{t}$ only when infected (probability $p$). Thus, their average fitness is\n$$\nW_{t} = (1 - p)\\cdot 1 + p \\cdot (1 - c_{t}) = 1 - p c_{t}.\n$$\n\nThe critical prevalence $p_{crit}$ is defined by equality of average fitnesses:\n$$\nW_{r} = W_{t} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad 1 - c_{r} = 1 - p_{crit} c_{t}.\n$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides and multiplying by $-1$ gives\n$$\nc_{r} = p_{crit} c_{t}.\n$$\nSince $c_{t} > 0$, division yields\n$$\np_{crit} = \\frac{c_{r}}{c_{t}}.\n$$\n\nThis expression is valid for positive $c_{r}$ and $c_{t}$.

This problem explores the influential \"trade-off hypothesis,\" which posits that virulence evolves as a balance between the benefits of rapid replication and the costs of harming the host upon which the parasite depends for transmission. You will analyze a hypothetical scenario to understand how a parasite's mode of transmission—whether dependent on a mobile host or an independent vector—profoundly alters this balance, shaping the evolution of its deadliness [@problem_id:1853164].", "problem": "In the study of host-parasite coevolution, the \"trade-off hypothesis\" of virulence posits that parasites face an evolutionary trade-off between the rate of transmission to new hosts and the harm (virulence) they inflict upon their current host. Consider a hypothetical scenario involving two closely related species of pathogens that infect the same population of small, mobile mammals.\n\nPathogen Alpha is transmitted directly from host to host through social contact, such as grooming and sharing burrows. Successful transmission of Pathogen Alpha is therefore dependent on the host being mobile and engaging in normal social behaviors.\n\nPathogen Beta is transmitted exclusively by an external vector, a species of biting insect that is attracted to warm-blooded animals regardless of their health or activity level. The insect vector can acquire the pathogen by biting an infected host and can then transmit it to a healthy host in a subsequent bite.\n\nAssuming both pathogens have been coevolving with this host population for a long time, and that higher parasite replication rates within a host lead to both increased virulence (i.e., more severe disease and higher host mortality) and a higher probability of transmission per contact/bite, which of the following statements represents the most likely evolutionary outcome predicted by the trade-off hypothesis?\n\nA. Pathogen Alpha is expected to evolve higher virulence than Pathogen Beta because direct contact is a more efficient transmission mechanism, favoring rapid parasite replication.\n\nB. Pathogen Beta is expected to evolve higher virulence than Pathogen Alpha because its transmission is not dependent on host mobility, thus reducing the selective cost of harming or immobilizing the host.\n\nC. Both pathogens are expected to evolve toward minimal virulence (near-zero), as harming the host is always evolutionarily disadvantageous to the parasite.\n\nD. Both pathogens are expected to evolve a similar intermediate level of virulence, as the primary constraint on virulence is the host's immune system, which is the same for both infections.\n\nE. The virulence of Pathogen Beta is expected to decrease over time, as the biting insects will learn to avoid hosts that are visibly ill.", "solution": "Let $x$ denote the within-host replication rate. By the trade-off hypothesis, higher $x$ increases both virulence and transmission probability per contact or bite. Let $\\beta(x)$ be the probability of transmission per contact/bite with $\\frac{d\\beta}{dx}>0$, and let $d(x)$ be the expected duration of infectiousness with $\\frac{dd}{dx}<0$ (due to increased host mortality at higher $x$). Let $c$ represent the rate at which potentially infectious contacts or bites occur.\n\nFor Pathogen Alpha (direct contact dependent on host mobility and social behavior), let $c_{A}(x)$ denote the contact rate, with $\\frac{dc_{A}}{dx}<0$ because increased virulence reduces host mobility and social interactions. The basic reproductive number can be written as\n$$\nR_{0,A}(x)=c_{A}(x)\\,\\beta(x)\\,d(x).\n$$\nFor Pathogen Beta (vector-borne, with biting independent of host activity per the scenario), let $c_{B}$ denote the vector biting/contact rate, which is approximately independent of host condition, so $\\frac{dc_{B}}{dx}=0$. Its basic reproductive number is\n$$\nR_{0,B}(x)=c_{B}\\,\\beta(x)\\,d(x).\n$$\n\nThe evolutionarily favored virulence corresponds to the value of $x$ that maximizes $R_{0}$. Consider the first-order condition in logarithmic form.

However, Alpha has the additional negative term $\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln c_{A}(x)<0$, which further penalizes increases in $x$. Therefore, for Alpha the marginal cost of increasing $x$ (through reduced contact rate and shorter infectious period) is greater than for Beta, shifting the optimal $x$ to a lower value. Since virulence increases with $x$, the optimal virulence for Alpha is lower than for Beta, while Beta, facing no reduction in contact rate with increasing virulence, evolves a higher optimal $x$ and thus higher virulence.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: although higher $x$ raises per-contact transmission, Alpha’s transmission depends on host mobility, which is reduced by virulence, selecting against very high virulence.\n- B is correct: Beta’s transmission is decoupled from host mobility; thus the selective cost of harming the host is reduced, favoring higher virulence.\n- C is incorrect: the trade-off hypothesis predicts an intermediate optimum, not minimal virulence.\n- D is incorrect: transmission mode alters the cost of virulence beyond host immune constraints.\n- E is incorrect: the scenario states vectors bite regardless of host health; moreover, learning avoidance is not the operative evolutionary mechanism posited here.\n\nTherefore, the trade-off hypothesis predicts higher virulence for the vector-borne Pathogen Beta than for the directly transmitted Pathogen Alpha.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1853164"}]}
