{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The stability of any mimicry system hinges on the behavior of the predator. This thought experiment probes the foundational principles of mimicry by asking you to predict the evolutionary outcome when a key element—predator learning from negative reinforcement—is removed from the equation. By considering a hypothetical predator that is immune to a model's defenses, you can isolate and appreciate the critical role of selective pressure in maintaining these complex visual signals. [@problem_id:1831762]", "problem": "On a remote island, a stable ecological community includes three insect species that participate in a mimicry complex. Species A (a bee) and Species B (a wasp) are both venomous and share a nearly identical, conspicuous yellow-and-black warning coloration. Their shared signal is an example of Müllerian mimicry, where two or more well-defended species mutually benefit by adopting a common aposematic signal. Species C (a hoverfly) is completely harmless but has evolved to closely resemble the bees and wasps, an example of Batesian mimicry. The primary predators on the island are native birds that learn, after a few unpleasant encounters, to avoid insects with this specific coloration.\n\nA new predator, a species of honey badger, is introduced to the island. This predator is \"naive,\" meaning it has no prior experience with the local fauna. Critically, this honey badger species possesses a genetic immunity to the venoms of both the bees and the wasps, so it receives no negative consequences from eating them. The honey badger hunts by sight and becomes a significant new source of predation on all three insect species.\n\nGiven this scenario, what is the most likely long-term evolutionary outcome for the mimicry complex?\n\nA. The Müllerian mimicry between the bees and wasps will be reinforced because the increased predation culls weaker individuals, while the Batesian mimicry of the hoverfly will be eliminated.\n\nB. The Batesian mimicry will be strengthened, as the hoverflies now have two distinct predators to \"trick\", while the Müllerian mimicry between bees and wasps remains unaffected.\n\nC. The entire mimicry complex will be strengthened, as the new predator will eventually learn to associate the warning coloration with the less-preferred taste of the insects compared to other available prey.\n\nD. The selective pressure that maintains the distinct warning coloration will be reduced or even reversed for the defended species (bees and wasps), potentially leading to the breakdown of the entire mimicry complex.\n\nE. The populations of all three species will evolve to become more venomous as a direct response to the new, highly effective predator.", "solution": "Aposematic warning coloration is adaptive when predators experience a fitness cost from attacking defended prey and consequently learn to avoid the warning signal. In Müllerian mimicry, multiple defended species share a conspicuous signal, and positive frequency-dependent selection arises because every attack on any model reinforces avoidance of the whole signal class. In Batesian mimicry, an undefended mimic gains protection because predators generalize avoidance from defended models to all bearers of the signal; this protection is strongest when defended models are common relative to mimics and when predators incur costs from attacking models.\n\nIntroducing a naive predator that is genetically immune to the venoms of the defended species removes the key mechanism that sustains aposematism for that predator: there is no aversive reinforcement from attacking bees or wasps. Because the honey badger hunts by sight and suffers no negative consequence from consuming either defended species, the shared conspicuous yellow-and-black signal ceases to function as a deterrent for that predator. Instead, it becomes a reliable visual cue that identifies edible prey. Since the honey badger becomes a significant source of predation, the net selection on the warning coloration in bees and wasps is reduced or can even reverse if the badger’s predation pressure outweighs the avoidance by native birds. Under such conditions, selection may favor reduced conspicuousness or divergence from the shared aposematic pattern, undermining the mutual reinforcement that maintains Müllerian mimicry.\n\nFor the Batesian mimic, the hoverfly’s protection depends on predators avoiding the signal because of the defended models. The honey badger’s immunity removes this protection; it will attack hoverflies as readily as the models, eroding the benefit of Batesian mimicry. Moreover, if bees and wasps evolve away from the aposematic pattern due to the new predation regime, the model signal degrades, further reducing any residual protection for the mimic.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of an immune, visually hunting predator that exerts substantial predation pressure reduces or reverses selection maintaining the shared warning coloration in the defended species and concurrently destroys the protection of the Batesian mimic. The most likely long-term outcome is the breakdown of the entire mimicry complex. This matches option D and contradicts the alternatives: reinforcement of Müllerian mimicry (A) is unlikely because attacks incur no cost to the predator; strengthening of Batesian mimicry with Müllerian unaffected (B) is inconsistent with the loss of predator avoidance; global strengthening due to learned distaste (C) is precluded by immunity and lack of aversive reinforcement; and escalation of venom potency across all three species (E) is not a viable response given predator immunity and the hoverfly’s lack of venom.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1831762"}, {"introduction": "Batesian mimicry is a game of numbers where the harmless mimic's success depends on not being too common relative to its dangerous model. This exercise challenges you to translate this ecological principle into a simple mathematical model, focusing on the predator's decision-making process. You will determine the maximum sustainable population of mimics by balancing the fitness cost of attacking a model against the benefit of consuming a mimic, providing a clear illustration of negative frequency-dependent selection. [@problem_id:1831766]", "problem": "In a simplified ecosystem model, a population of avian predators preys upon three species of snakes: a venomous coral snake (the model), a harmless kingsnake that mimics the coral snake's coloration (the mimic), and a harmless, non-patterned garter snake (the non-mimic). The population densities of these snakes are $D_M$, $D_m$, and $D_N$, respectively. The predators are intelligent and can learn to avoid the distinctive warning pattern shared by the model and the mimic.\n\nLet's quantify the fitness consequences for a predator: an attack on a venomous model incurs a severe fitness cost $C$, where $C > 0$, while successfully capturing and consuming a harmless snake (either mimic or non-mimic) yields a fitness benefit $B$, where $B > 0$. The predators in this ecosystem will collectively learn to avoid the warning pattern if, on average, an attack on a snake bearing this pattern results in a negative expected fitness change. This collective learning is based on the relative abundance of model and mimic snakes. If mimics become too common, the \"lesson\" of the warning signal is diluted, and the pattern ceases to be an effective deterrent.\n\nAssuming that a predator encountering a patterned snake cannot distinguish between a model and a mimic before attacking, determine the maximum possible density of the mimic population, $D_{m, \\text{max}}$, for which the mimicry remains an effective strategy. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the model snake density $D_M$, the predator fitness cost $C$, and the predator fitness benefit $B$.", "solution": "Let the total density of patterned snakes be $D_{P} = D_{M} + D_{m}$.

An attack on a model yields $-C$ and an attack on a mimic yields $+B$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Delta F = p_{M}(-C) + p_{m} B = \\frac{-C D_{M} + B D_{m}}{D_{M} + D_{m}}.\n$$\nPredators will collectively learn to avoid the warning pattern if the expected change is negative, i.e., $\\Delta F < 0$.
