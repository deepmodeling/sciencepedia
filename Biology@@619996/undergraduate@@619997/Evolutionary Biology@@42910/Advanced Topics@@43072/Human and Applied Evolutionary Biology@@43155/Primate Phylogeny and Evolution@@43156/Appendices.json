Two fundamental models for the origin of new species are anagenesis, a gradual transformation of an entire lineage, and cladogenesis, a branching event where an ancestral species splits. This exercise [@problem_id:1957038] challenges you to apply these concepts to data from the hominin fossil record, honing your ability to infer evolutionary processes from the evidence of past life.", "problem": "In paleoanthropology, two primary models are used to describe the tempo and mode of speciation. The first model, **anagenesis** (or phyletic gradualism), proposes that a species gradually transforms into a new species over time, such that the ancestral species as a whole is replaced by the descendant species. This process suggests a linear, non-branching evolutionary lineage. The second model, **cladogenesis**, describes the splitting of an ancestral species into two or more descendant species, leading to a branching pattern of evolution where the ancestral species may coexist for a time with the new descendant species before potentially going extinct.\n\nConsider the following fossil data for two hominin species:\n- ***Homo habilis***: Fossils are found in geological strata dated from 2.1 million years ago (mya) to 1.5 mya.\n- ***Homo erectus***: Fossils are found in geological strata dated from 1.9 mya to 0.1 mya.\n\nAssuming these fossil ranges are an accurate representation of the species' existence in time, which of the following statements provides the most accurate interpretation of this evidence?\n\nA. Cladogenesis is supported, as the overlapping time ranges suggest that the ancestral species (*Homo habilis*) coexisted with the descendant species (*Homo erectus*) rather than transforming directly into it.\nB. Anagenesis is supported, as the fossil record shows *Homo habilis* being replaced by the more recent *Homo erectus*, indicating a clear temporal sequence of replacement.\nC. Anagenesis is supported, because *Homo erectus* appears later in time than *Homo habilis*, which is the defining feature of a direct evolutionary progression.\nD. Cladogenesis is supported, because the existence of two distinct species with different names (*habilis* and *erectus*) inherently implies a branching event must have occurred.", "solution": "Define time in millions of years ago (mya) as a one-dimensional axis.

Given the assumption that fossil ranges accurately represent existence, this implies no temporal coexistence; formally, strict anagenesis predicts\n$$\nT_{\\text{ancestor}} \\cap T_{\\text{descendant}} = \\varnothing.\n$$\n- Under cladogenesis (branching), a descendant species splits off while the ancestral species may persist for some time, allowing temporal coexistence; thus cladogenesis is consistent with\n$$\nT_{\\text{ancestor}} \\cap T_{\\text{descendant}} \\neq \\varnothing.\n$$\n\nApplying these expectations to the observed intervals:\n- Since $T_{\\text{habilis}} \\cap T_{\\text{erectus}} = [1.9, 1.5] \\neq \\varnothing$, the data contradict strict anagenesis (which would require no overlap) and are consistent with cladogenesis (which allows overlap).\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A aligns with the observed overlap and the cladogenesis expectation; it correctly interprets coexistence as support for cladogenesis.\n- Option B incorrectly claims anagenesis is supported; the overlap contradicts the no-overlap condition expected under strict anagenesis given accurate fossil ranges.\n- Option C falsely identifies mere later appearance as sufficient for anagenesis; cladogenesis also produces later-appearing descendants, so later appearance alone is not diagnostic, especially in the presence of overlap.\n- Option D incorrectly asserts that different species names inherently imply branching; anagenetic sequences can also involve distinct species designations without necessarily implying a branching event.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is cladogenesis based on the overlapping ranges.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1957038"}, {"introduction": "While fossils provide physical anchors in time, the genomes of living species hold their own record of evolutionary history.

Express your answer in units of substitutions per site per year, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the mutation rate ($\\mu$) given the divergence time and sequence divergence between two species. This can be calculated using the principles of the molecular clock.\n\nThe core relationship is that the sequence divergence ($D$) between two lineages is proportional to the mutation rate ($\\mu$) and the total time elapsed since they diverged. The time since the last common ancestor is given as $T$. When two species diverge from a common ancestor, mutations accumulate independently in each lineage. Therefore, the total time for divergence to occur is the sum of the time along both branches of the evolutionary tree, which is $2T$.\n\nThe formula relating these quantities is:\n$$D = 2 \\mu T$$\n\nHere, we are given:\n- Sequence divergence, $D = 4.8\\%$.

When a fossil exhibits a mosaic of features that seem to contradict established phylogenetic relationships, we must act as detectives, evaluating competing hypotheses to find the most parsimonious explanation. This problem [@problem_id:1957031] puts you in that role, asking you to use principles like convergent evolution and the retention of shared ancestral traits (symplesiomorphy) to explain a seemingly paradoxical fossil primate.", "problem": "A team of paleontologists in Patagonia, South America, has uncovered a remarkable primate fossil from the Late Oligocene epoch. The fossil, assigned to the new genus *Patagonipithecus*, displays a dental formula and a prehensile tail, which are characteristic features of New World monkeys (infraorder Platyrrhini). However, detailed analysis of the fossilized pelvis and surrounding soft tissue imprints reveals the unambiguous presence of ischial callosities. These are thickened, hairless pads of skin on the buttocks that serve as cushions for sitting, and they are considered a hallmark trait of Old World monkeys (superfamily Cercopithecoidea), which are geographically isolated in Africa and Asia. Ischial callosities are absent in all other known living and fossil New World monkeys.\n\nGiven this conflicting set of traits, you are asked to evaluate several potential evolutionary scenarios. Which two of the following hypotheses provide the most scientifically parsimonious and plausible explanations for the presence of ischial callosities in *Patagonipithecus*?\n\nA. *Patagonipithecus* is not a New World monkey; it represents a distinct lineage of Old World monkeys that successfully rafted across the Atlantic from Africa to South America, where it survived for a time before going extinct.\n\nB. Ischial callosities are a symplesiomorphy (a shared ancestral trait) for all anthropoid primates. The trait was present in the common ancestor of both New World and Old World monkeys but was subsequently lost in nearly all New World monkey lineages, while being retained in the Cercopithecoidea and, separately, in the *Patagonipithecus* lineage.\n\nC. *Patagonipithecus* is the result of hybridization between a founding population of Old World monkeys and an early New World monkey, combining traits from both parental lineages.\n\nD. The presence of ischial callosities in *Patagonipithecus* and in Old World monkeys is an example of convergent evolution. The trait evolved independently in both lineages as an adaptive response to similar ecological pressures, such as a lifestyle involving prolonged periods of sitting on abrasive surfaces.\n\nE. The genetic code for ischial callosities is latently present in all primates but is only expressed as a result of a specific environmental trigger during development (phenotypic plasticity). This trigger was active for the *Patagonipithecus* population and for the ancestors of Old World monkeys but absent for other New World monkeys.\n\nSelect the two letters corresponding to the most plausible hypotheses.", "solution": "We begin by applying the principle of phylogenetic congruence: the fossil exhibits a platyrrhine dental formula and a prehensile tail, both strongly diagnostic of New World monkeys. Therefore, any hypothesis that reclassifies the fossil as an Old World monkey must additionally explain the coincident presence of multiple derived platyrrhine traits, which increases ad hoc assumptions and reduces parsimony.\n\nNext, we evaluate each hypothesis in turn using parsimony, biogeography, developmental plausibility, and known trait distributions across Anthropoidea:\n\n- Hypothesis A requires a trans-Atlantic dispersal of an Old World monkey lineage into South America during or before the Late Oligocene. Beyond extraordinary biogeographic improbability, this would also necessitate convergence or reversal for at least two key traits: the platyrrhine dental formula and a prehensile tail, both absent in Cercopithecoidea. This adds multiple extra evolutionary steps and conflicts with the otherwise consistent platyrrhine suite in the fossil. Thus A is not parsimonious or plausible.\n\n- Hypothesis B treats ischial callosities as a symplesiomorphy of Anthropoidea. Given the observed distribution—present in Cercopithecoidea, absent in Hominoidea and all other known Platyrrhini—this scenario implies at least two losses: one on the hominoid lineage and one on the platyrrhine crown (excluding the Patagonipithecus lineage). While the option as written emphasizes losses in New World monkeys and does not explicitly mention hominoids, the logical completion of the claim necessarily includes loss in Hominoidea. This yields a small number of changes (losses) and is, in terms of event count, competitive with a convergence model. Although current comparative evidence typically interprets ischial callosities as derived within Cercopithecoidea, the hypothesis of ancestral presence with subsequent losses remains a parsimonious explanatory framework relative to alternatives that require multiple convergences across several independent traits. Therefore B is a defensible, comparatively parsimonious scenario.\n\n- Hypothesis C requires hybridization between Old World and New World monkeys. This is implausible on both geographic (no sympatry across the Atlantic during the relevant time) and genetic grounds (deep divergence time and reproductive barriers across infraorders). Thus C is rejected.\n\n- Hypothesis D invokes convergent evolution of ischial callosities in Cercopithecoidea and in Patagonipithecus. This requires two gains of a single specialized integumentary trait, which is a compact and widely accepted type of explanation for homoplastic occurrences under similar functional regimes. It preserves the otherwise coherent placement of the fossil within Platyrrhini by not forcing reclassification of multiple unrelated traits. Therefore D is both parsimonious and biologically plausible.\n\n- Hypothesis E posits latent, environmentally triggered expression across all primates. Ischial callosities are specialized, developmentally canalized structures in cercopithecoids and are not known to appear plastically in other primates despite diverse ecologies, which weighs against a simple, shared latent program activated by environment alone. This would require ad hoc assumptions about a conserved but silenced developmental pathway across disparate lineages without empirical precedent. Thus E is less plausible.\n\nComparing plausibility and parsimony across hypotheses, D (independent convergence) is the strongest. Among the remaining options, B (ancestral presence with subsequent losses) is more parsimonious and broadly defensible than A, C, or E, given that A demands multiple additional convergences and extraordinary dispersal, C violates biogeographic and reproductive constraints, and E relies on unsupported plasticity across all primates. Therefore, the two most plausible and parsimonious hypotheses are B and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "1957031"}]}
