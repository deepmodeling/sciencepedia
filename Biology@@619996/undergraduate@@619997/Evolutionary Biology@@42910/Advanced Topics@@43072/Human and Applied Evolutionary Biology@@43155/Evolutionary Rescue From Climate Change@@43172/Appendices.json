As an environment shifts, individuals carrying certain alleles may gain a survival and reproductive edge. This practice provides a direct way to quantify this process by calculating the strength of selection from an observed change in allele frequencies over a single generation. By determining the selection coefficient, $s$, you will connect a tangible environmental pressure to its microevolutionary consequence, solidifying your understanding of the engine that drives adaptation [@problem_id:1927505].", "problem": "A population of alpine insects, *Cryophila montana*, is studied by evolutionary biologists over a period of rapid environmental warming. Researchers focus on a single gene, *ThR* (Thermal Response), which has two alleles: a 'cold-adapted' allele, $A_C$, and a 'heat-tolerant' allele, $A_H$. The heat-tolerant allele, $A_H$, is completely dominant over the $A_C$ allele.\n\nAt the beginning of the study (Generation 0), the frequency of the $A_H$ allele in the population was measured to be $0.050$. After one generation, under the new, warmer conditions, a new sample was taken and the frequency of the $A_H$ allele (Generation 1) was found to be $0.061$.\n\nAssume that the change in allele frequency is due solely to natural selection and that the population mates randomly. The model of selection is such that the genotypes containing the dominant $A_H$ allele ($A_H A_H$ and $A_H A_C$) have a relative fitness of 1, while the homozygous recessive genotype ($A_C A_C$) has a reduced relative fitness of $1-s$, where $s$ is the selection coefficient.\n\nCalculate the selection coefficient, $s$, acting against the homozygous recessive $A_C A_C$ genotype during this one-generation interval.

This is especially true for complex traits like temperature tolerance, which are influenced by many genes. This exercise introduces the Breeder's equation, $R = h^2 S$, a central tool in quantitative genetics that links the evolutionary response ($R$) to the heritability of a trait ($h^2$) and the strength of selection ($S$). Working through this scenario will help you calculate the minimum genetic potential required for a population to keep pace with a changing climate, a critical aspect of predicting extinction risk [@problem_id:1927493].", "problem": "A population of desert lizards is facing a long-term, steady increase in average ambient temperature due to regional climate change. The survival of these lizards is critically dependent on their ability to tolerate high temperatures, a trait quantified by their Critical Thermal Maximum (CTM), measured in degrees Celsius.\n\nEcological models project that the average ambient temperature is increasing at a constant rate of $k_T$ degrees Celsius per year. The lizard population has a fixed generation time of $G$ years. To remain physiologically adapted to the warming environment, the population's mean CTM must increase in lockstep with the temperature. It has been determined that for every one-degree Celsius increase in average ambient temperature, the population's mean CTM must increase by an amount $\\beta$ to maintain a constant survival probability.\n\nWithin each generation, natural selection acts on the CTM trait. The individuals who survive to reproduce have a mean CTM that is consistently $S$ degrees Celsius higher than the mean CTM of the entire population before selection. This constant difference, $S$, is the selection differential.\n\nAssuming the population is initially perfectly adapted, determine the minimum value of the narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) of the CTM trait that is required for the lizard population's mean CTM to evolve at a rate just sufficient to track the environmental change and thereby avoid extinction.

While the potential for genetic adaptation is vital, it can be rendered irrelevant by demographic collapse.

It illustrates that a severe environmental event can drive a population below this point of no return, regardless of the adaptive traits of the survivors.
