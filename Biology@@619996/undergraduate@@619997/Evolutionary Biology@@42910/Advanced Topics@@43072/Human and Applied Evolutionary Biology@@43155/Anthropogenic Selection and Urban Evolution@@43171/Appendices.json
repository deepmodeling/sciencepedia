This exercise [@problem_id:1909180] challenges you to think about how the removal of traditional predators and the introduction of new, human-related pressures can completely reshape the adaptive value of a trait. By evaluating different hypotheses for a change in egg coloration, you will practice the critical thinking skills an evolutionary biologist uses to explain observable changes in the wild.", "problem": "A species of ground-nesting bird, the \"Park-dweller Pipit,\" historically inhabited grasslands where its primary predators were visually-oriented hunters like foxes and predatory birds. Consequently, its eggs evolved to have a mottled brown coloration, providing excellent camouflage against the soil and dried vegetation.\n\nA founder population of these pipits colonized a large, newly-established urban park several decades ago. This park has virtually no natural predators for the birds. However, it experiences high foot traffic from pedestrians and off-leash dogs. Biologists studying this isolated park population have observed a consistent, directional shift over 50 years: the pipits' eggs have become significantly lighter in color and less mottled, making them more conspicuous against the ground.\n\nAssuming this change is a result of evolutionary adaptation, which of the following statements provides the most complete and plausible explanation for the observed shift in egg coloration in the urban park population?\n\nA. The absence of natural predators led to relaxed selection for camouflage, so non-camouflaged eggs, which are metabolically cheaper to produce, became more common.\n\nB. The change is due to a random founder effect. The small number of birds that initially colonized the park happened to carry alleles for lighter-colored eggs, and this trait became fixed in the population over time.\n\nC. The lighter egg color is an aposematic signal, warning potential tramplers like humans and dogs that the eggs are fragile or unpalatable, thus deterring them from approaching the nest.\n\nD. With the selective pressure from natural predators removed, a new selective pressure has become dominant: brighter eggs are more easily noticed by humans, who can then take care to avoid stepping on the nests, leading to higher hatching success for more conspicuous eggs.\n\nE. Urban pollutants have interfered with the birds' pigment deposition biochemistry, causing a non-adaptive, pathological change in eggshell coloration that has no bearing on survival.", "solution": "We interpret the problem as asking for the most complete adaptive explanation for a directional evolutionary change in egg coloration in an urban park where the historical predation regime (visually oriented foxes and raptors) has been largely removed, while a new hazard (trampling by humans and off-leash dogs) has become common.\n\nFirst, we recall the principle of natural selection: a trait increases in frequency if heritable variation in that trait is associated with differential survival or reproduction under current environmental conditions. Historically, mottled brown eggs were favored by selection imposed by visually hunting predators because camouflage reduces detection, thereby increasing hatching success. In the urban park, that predation pressure is relaxed or absent, reducing or eliminating the advantage of camouflage.\n\nNext, we evaluate whether a new selective agent could impose directional selection on egg coloration. In a high-foot-traffic environment, nests are at risk of being trampled. If more conspicuous eggs are more likely to be detected by humans, humans can deliberately avoid stepping on or near the nest, and may also call off dogs or otherwise provide incidental protection. Therefore, conspicuousness can increase nest survival under these conditions, favoring lighter, less mottled eggs. This represents a shift in the selective landscape: removal of the historical predator-driven selection for crypsis and the emergence of human-mediated selection for detectability.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\n- Option A posits relaxed selection for camouflage coupled with a metabolic cost advantage of reduced pigmentation. While relaxed selection explains why camouflage is no longer maintained, the assertion that non-camouflaged eggs are metabolically cheaper and that this cost difference is sufficient to drive a strong, consistent, directional shift is speculative and incomplete. It does not identify a clear, strong new selective benefit for conspicuous eggs, and resource savings alone may be weak relative to survival differences.\n\n- Option B invokes a founder effect and fixation by drift. This is non-adaptive and conflicts with the problem’s stipulation to assume the change is an evolutionary adaptation. Moreover, a consistent, directional change over many generations in a large park population is more consistent with selection than with drift.\n\n- Option C suggests aposematism, but aposematic signals deter predators by signaling unprofitability (e.g., toxicity), which is not applicable to eggs and not relevant to trampling. Humans and dogs are not expected to learn avoidance from an aposematic egg signal in this context; rather, they avoid stepping on eggs if they notice them.\n\n- Option D recognizes both the relaxation of the historical selective pressure and the emergence of a new, stronger selective pressure favoring conspicuous eggs via increased human detection and avoidance. This provides a direct, plausible mechanism for the observed directional selection and matches the urban park context.\n\n- Option E posits a non-adaptive, pathological effect of pollutants, which contradicts the assumption of adaptation and does not account for consistent directional change linked to increased hatching success.\n\nTherefore, the most complete and plausible adaptive explanation is that with predator-driven selection for camouflage removed, human-mediated selection for nest detectability now favors more conspicuous eggs, as in Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1909180"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand evolution, we must be able to quantify its pace and direction. This problem [@problem_id:1909169] provides a hands-on opportunity to apply the fundamental principles of population genetics to a classic urban evolution scenario—adaptation to a city's heat island effect. You will calculate the change in an allele's frequency over a single generation, giving you a concrete sense of how potent selection can be in driving rapid evolutionary responses.", "problem": "A population of wall lizards from a large, stable forest environment begins to colonize a new urban area. In the forest, the allele frequency for a gene related to thermal tolerance has been stable for many generations. This gene has two alleles: a dominant allele $T$ that confers high heat tolerance, and a recessive allele $t$ that confers standard heat tolerance. The initial frequency of the recessive allele $t$ in the founding urban population is $q_0 = 0.8$.\n\nThe urban environment, with its large, sun-baked concrete surfaces, imposes a strong selective pressure. Individuals with the standard heat tolerance phenotype (genotype $\\text{tt}$) have a lower survival rate. The relative fitness of genotypes are as follows: the fitness of $\\text{TT}$ is 1, the fitness of $\\text{Tt}$ is 1, and the fitness of $\\text{tt}$ is $0.75$.\n\nAssuming the population mates randomly after selection occurs, calculate the frequency of the recessive allele $t$ in the next generation (the first generation born in the city). Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal is to calculate the frequency of the recessive allele $t$ after one generation of natural selection, which we will denote as $q_1$.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial conditions of the population. The initial frequency of the recessive allele $t$ is given as $q_0 = 0.8$. Since there are only two alleles for this gene, the frequency of the dominant allele $T$, denoted as $p_0$, must be:\n$$p_0 = 1 - q_0 = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\n\nNext, assuming the founding population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), we can calculate the initial frequencies of the three genotypes before selection acts:\n- Frequency of homozygous dominant ($\\text{TT}$): $f(\\text{TT}) = p_0^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04$\n- Frequency of heterozygous ($\\text{Tt}$): $f(\\text{Tt}) = 2p_0q_0 = 2(0.2)(0.8) = 0.32$\n- Frequency of homozygous recessive ($\\text{tt}$): $f(\\text{tt}) = q_0^2 = (0.8)^2 = 0.64$\nAs a check, the sum of these frequencies is $0.04 + 0.32 + 0.64 = 1.0$.\n\nNow, we introduce the effect of selection. The relative fitness values ($w$) are given for each genotype: $w_{\\text{TT}} = 1$, $w_{\\text{Tt}} = 1$, and $w_{\\text{tt}} = 0.75$. We can find the contribution of each genotype to the gene pool of the next generation by multiplying its initial frequency by its relative fitness.\n- Contribution from $\\text{TT}$: $f(\\text{TT}) \\times w_{\\text{TT}} = 0.04 \\times 1 = 0.04$\n- Contribution from $\\text{Tt}$: $f(\\text{Tt}) \\times w_{\\text{Tt}} = 0.32 \\times 1 = 0.32$\n- Contribution from $\\text{tt}$: $f(\\text{tt}) \\times w_{\\text{tt}} = 0.64 \\times 0.75 = 0.48$\n\nThe sum of these products gives the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$.

Homozygous $\\text{tt}$ individuals contribute only $t$ alleles, while heterozygous $\\text{Tt}$ individuals contribute $t$ alleles half the time.

She collects seeds from both the highway population (H) and the meadow population (M). In a controlled greenhouse, she plants seeds from both populations in two different soil treatments: (1) clean soil sourced from the meadow and (2) contaminated soil sourced from the highway site.

All *Silene urbanica* plants have the same underlying genetic potential for growth, but this potential is suppressed by the presence of toxins.\n2.  **Fixed Genetic Divergence**: The highway population has undergone rapid evolution.
