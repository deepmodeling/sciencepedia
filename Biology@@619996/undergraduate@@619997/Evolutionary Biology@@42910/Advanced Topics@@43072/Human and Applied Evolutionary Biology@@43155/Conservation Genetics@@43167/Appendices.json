This exercise [@problem_id:1479190] demonstrates how to calculate $N_e$ and reveals how demographic factors, such as an unequal sex ratio, can dramatically reduce a population's genetic resilience.", "problem": "A conservation team has established a captive breeding program for the critically endangered Gilded Sun-wing Butterfly, a species recently decimated by a fungal pathogen. The founding population of this program consists of 45 breeding adults. Genetic screening reveals that this group is composed of only 5 sexually mature males, with the remainder being sexually mature females.\n\nThe effective population size ($N_e$) is a crucial metric in conservation genetics, representing the size of a theoretical, idealized population that would experience the same amount of random genetic drift as the actual population under study. Given the unequal sex ratio in the Gilded Sun-wing Butterfly breeding program, calculate the effective population size ($N_e$) for this founding group. Report your answer rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal of this problem is to calculate the effective population size ($N_e$) for a population with an unequal number of breeding males and females.\n\nFirst, we identify the given information from the problem statement:\nThe total number of breeding individuals is $N_{total} = 45$.\nThe number of breeding males is $N_m = 5$.\n\nNext, we must determine the number of breeding females, $N_f$. Since the total population consists of only males and females, we can find $N_f$ by subtracting the number of males from the total population:\n$N_f = N_{total} - N_m$\n$N_f = 45 - 5 = 40$\nSo, there are 40 breeding females.\n\nThe formula for calculating the effective population size ($N_e$) when there is an unequal sex ratio of breeding individuals is:\n$$N_e = \\frac{4 N_m N_f}{N_m + N_f}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the values of $N_m$ and $N_f$ into this formula:\n$N_m = 5$\n$N_f = 40$\n\n$$N_e = \\frac{4 \\times 5 \\times 40}{5 + 40}$$\n\nWe perform the arithmetic in the numerator and the denominator:\nNumerator: $4 \\times 5 \\times 40 = 20 \\times 40 = 800$\nDenominator: $5 + 40 = 45$\n\nSo, the expression for $N_e$ becomes:\n$$N_e = \\frac{800}{45}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$N_e = 17.777...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are 1, 7, and 7. The fourth digit is 7, which is 5 or greater, so we round up the third significant figure.\n$$N_e \\approx 17.8$$\n\nThus, the effective population size of the founding colony is approximately 17.8.

To manage this risk, conservationists must be able to quantify it using the inbreeding coefficient ($F$), which measures the probability that an individual inherits two identical alleles from a common ancestor. This practice [@problem_id:1479182] provides a foundational exercise in calculating $F$ from a known pedigree, a critical task in the management of captive or isolated populations.", "problem": "A conservation breeding program for the endangered gray wolf is established at a zoological park. The founding population consists of a single breeding pair: a male named 'Lobo' and a female named 'Luna'. These two founders were captured from two geographically distant and large wild populations, and it can be safely assumed that they are unrelated and not inbred.\n\nLobo and Luna produce a litter of offspring. To rapidly increase the captive population, the program managers decide to mate two of these offspring, who are full siblings, with each other. This mating produces a single pup named 'Fenrir'.\n\nCalculate the inbreeding coefficient ($F$) of the pup, Fenrir. Express your answer as a single fraction in its simplest form.", "solution": "The inbreeding coefficient $F$ of an individual is defined as the probability that its two alleles at a locus are identical by descent. A fundamental relationship is that the inbreeding coefficient of an offspring equals the kinship (coancestry) coefficient between its parents:\n$$\nF_{\\text{offspring}} = f_{\\text{parents}}\n$$.\nThe kinship coefficient between two individuals $X$ and $Y$ can be computed using the path method (Malecot’s formula):\n$$\nf_{XY} = \\sum_{A} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n_{1} + n_{2} + 1} \\left(1 + F_{A}\\right)\n$$,\nwhere the sum is over all common ancestors $A$ of $X$ and $Y$, and $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are the number of meioses from $A$ to $X$ and from $A$ to $Y$ along a non-overlapping path, respectively. Here, Lobo and Luna are unrelated, non-inbred founders, so $F_{\\text{Lobo}} = 0$ and $F_{\\text{Luna}} = 0$.\n\nFenrir’s parents are full siblings, both offspring of Lobo and Luna. The common ancestors of the two parents are exactly Lobo and Luna. For each of these ancestors, the path lengths are $n_{1} = 1$ and $n_{2} = 1$. Therefore, the kinship between the parents (full siblings) is\n$$\nf_{\\text{full sibs}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1+1+1} \\left(1 + F_{\\text{Lobo}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1+1+1} \\left(1 + F_{\\text{Luna}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$.\nHence,\n$$\nF_{\\text{Fenrir}} = f_{\\text{parents}} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$.\nThis fraction is already in simplest form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "1479182"}, {"introduction": "Conservation often occurs across fragmented landscapes where populations are linked by varying degrees of gene flow, forming a metapopulation.

Pond O is centrally located and serves as a hub, connecting to the three peripheral ponds A, B, and C via distinct, linear corridors. Each corridor is composed of a single, uniform habitat type.\n\n- The corridor from pond O to pond A has a length $L_A = 2.0$ km and consists entirely of pristine forest (Habitat 1).\n- The corridor from pond O to pond B has a length $L_B = 3.0$ km and consists entirely of agricultural pasture (Habitat 2).\n- The corridor from pond O to pond C has a length $L_C = 4.0$ km and consists entirely of managed pine plantation (Habitat 3).\n\nThe biologist's working hypothesis is that any salamander migration between the peripheral ponds (A, B, and C) must occur by passing through the central pond O. The genetic differentiation between any two populations is modeled using the principle of Isolation by Resistance (IBR). In this model, the linearized Fixation Index ($F_{ST}$), which is a measure of population differentiation, is defined as $G_{ij} = \\frac{F_{ST, ij}}{1 - F_{ST, ij}}$. The model posits a direct proportionality between this value and the effective resistance distance, $D_{\\text{eff}, ij}$, between any two ponds $i$ and $j$, such that $G_{ij} = k \\cdot D_{\\text{eff}, ij}$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality. The effective resistance distance is calculated by summing the products of corridor length and the habitat's specific resistance value for all segments along the path connecting the two ponds.\n\nBy convention, the resistance of the most permeable habitat, the pristine forest, is normalized to one. Therefore, the resistance for Habitat 1 is $R_1=1$.
