We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe basic reproduction number, denoted $R_0$, is defined as the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single infectious individual when introduced into a population that is entirely susceptible and at its demographic, disease-free equilibrium. This quantity can be calculated as the product of two factors: the rate at which an infected individual generates new infections and the average duration of the infectious period.\n\nFirst, we must determine the state of the population at the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). At this equilibrium, there is no infection, so the density of infectious hosts is $I^* = 0$ and the density of recovered hosts is $R^* = 0$. The total population dynamics are described by the sum of the system equations:\n$$\n\\dot{N} = \\dot{S} + \\dot{I} + \\dot{R} = (\\Lambda - \\beta\\frac{SI}{N} - \\mu S) + (\\beta\\frac{SI}{N} - (\\gamma+\\alpha+\\mu)I) + (\\gamma I - \\mu R)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields:\n$$\n\\dot{N} = \\Lambda - \\mu S - \\alpha I - \\mu I - \\gamma I + \\gamma I - \\mu R = \\Lambda - \\mu(S+I+R) - \\alpha I\n$$\nSince $N = S+I+R$, the equation for the total population is:\n$$\n\\dot{N} = \\Lambda - \\mu N - \\alpha I\n$$\nAt the disease-free equilibrium, we set $I=0$ and $\\dot{N}=0$. This gives:\n$$\n0 = \\Lambda - \\mu N^*\n$$\nThus, the total population size at the DFE is $N^* = \\frac{\\Lambda}{\\mu}$. The problem statement specifies that the population is wholly susceptible at this equilibrium, which is consistent with our findings that $I^*=0$ and $R^*=0$. Therefore, the susceptible population density at the DFE is $S^* = N^* = \\frac{\\Lambda}{\\mu}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the two components of $R_0$.\n\n$1$. Rate of secondary infections: An infectious individual is introduced into the susceptible population of size $S^*$. The rate of new infections is given by the term $\\beta \\frac{S I}{N}$. For a single infectious individual ($I=1$) in a population of size $N \\approx N^*$ where the susceptible density is $S \\approx S^*$, the rate at which this individual causes new infections is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of infection} = \\beta \\frac{S^* \\cdot 1}{N^*}\n$$\nSince at the DFE, $S^* = N^*$, this rate simplifies to $\\beta$. This is the number of new infections produced by one infectious individual per unit time.\n\n$2$. Average duration of infectiousness: An individual in the infectious compartment, $I$, can leave it through two pathways: recovery, at a per-capita rate of $\\gamma$, or death. Death occurs from natural causes at rate $\\mu$ or from the disease itself (virulence) at rate $\\alpha$. The total per-capita rate of exit from the infectious class is the sum of these rates: $\\gamma + \\alpha + \\mu$. The dynamics of the infectious period for an individual can be modeled as a stochastic process with a constant hazard rate. The average time an individual spends in a state before exiting is the reciprocal of the total exit rate. Therefore, the average duration of the infectious period, $T_{inf}$, is:\n$$\nT_{inf} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma + \\alpha + \\mu}\n$$\nThis is the average amount of time an infected individual has to transmit the pathogen.\n\nFinally, we calculate $R_0$ by multiplying the rate of secondary infections by the average duration of infectiousness:\n$$\nR_0 = (\\text{Rate of infection}) \\times (\\text{Average duration of infectiousness}) = \\beta \\times \\frac{1}{\\gamma+\\alpha+\\mu}\n$$\nThis gives the explicit expression for the basic reproduction number:\n$$\nR_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma+\\alpha+\\mu}\n$$\nNow, we use this result to analyze the influence of virulence, $\\alpha$, on pathogen invasion. The criterion for a pathogen to successfully invade a host population and cause an epidemic is that $R_0 > 1$. This means that, on average, each infected individual must produce more than one new infection. Substituting our expression for $R_0$, the invasion criterion is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma+\\alpha+\\mu} > 1\n$$\nThe parameter $\\alpha$, representing virulence, appears in the denominator. All parameters ($\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\alpha$, $\\mu$) are non-negative rates. An increase in virulence, $\\alpha$, while holding other parameters constant, increases the value of the denominator $(\\gamma+\\alpha+\\mu)$. This, in turn, decreases the overall value of $R_0$. The causal mechanism is straightforward: higher virulence leads to a higher disease-induced mortality rate. This shortens the average duration of the infectious period, as infected hosts are removed from the population more quickly through death. A shorter infectious period provides less opportunity for the pathogen to be transmitted to susceptible individuals. Consequently, a higher virulence $\\alpha$ makes it more difficult for the invasion condition $R_0 > 1$ to be met. All else being equal, a more virulent strain of a pathogen is less likely to successfully invade and establish itself in a new host population compared to a less virulent strain.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma+\\alpha+\\mu}}\n$$", "id": "2710068"}, {"introduction": "The previous practice suggests that lower virulence is always better for a pathogen, so why does high virulence exist at all? The answer lies in the transmission-virulence trade-off, a central hypothesis in evolutionary medicine stating that virulence is often a side effect of traits that enhance transmission.

We seek an interior solution, meaning $\\alpha^{*} > 0$.\n\nMaximizing $R_{0}(\\alpha)$ is equivalent to maximizing its natural logarithm, $\\ln(R_{0}(\\alpha))$, as the logarithm is a strictly increasing function. This simplifies the differentiation process. Let us define the function $L(\\alpha) = \\ln(R_{0}(\\alpha))$ for $\\alpha > 0$:\n$$L(\\alpha) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{b\\,\\alpha^{k}}{\\gamma+\\alpha}\\right) = \\ln(b) + k\\ln(\\alpha) - \\ln(\\gamma+\\alpha)$$\nTo find the critical points, we compute the first derivative of $L(\\alpha)$ with respect to $\\alpha$ and set it to zero.\n$$\\frac{dL}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\left( \\ln(b) + k\\ln(\\alpha) - \\ln(\\gamma+\\alpha) \\right) = \\frac{k}{\\alpha} - \\frac{1}{\\gamma+\\alpha}$$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the condition for a critical point $\\alpha^{*}$:\n$$\\frac{k}{\\alpha^{*}} - \\frac{1}{\\gamma+\\alpha^{*}} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{k}{\\alpha^{*}} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma+\\alpha^{*}}$$\nThis implies:\n$$k(\\gamma+\\alpha^{*}) = \\alpha^{*}$$\n$$k\\gamma + k\\alpha^{*} = \\alpha^{*}$$\nWe proceed to solve for $\\alpha^{*}$:\n$$k\\gamma = \\alpha^{*} - k\\alpha^{*} = \\alpha^{*}(1-k)$$\nThis yields the expression for the critical point:\n$$\\alpha^{*} = \\frac{k\\gamma}{1-k}$$\nFor this solution to be an interior point, we must have $\\alpha^{*} > 0$. Since $k > 0$ and $\\gamma > 0$, the numerator $k\\gamma$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the denominator must also be positive for $\\alpha^{*}$ to be positive:\n$$1-k > 0 \\implies k < 1$$\nCombining this with the given constraint $k > 0$, the necessary condition for the existence of a positive interior critical point is $0 < k < 1$. If $k \\ge 1$, the first derivative $\\frac{dL}{d\\alpha}$ is non-negative for all $\\alpha > 0$, meaning $R_0(\\alpha)$ is a non-decreasing function and has no interior maximum.\n\nNext, we must verify that this critical point corresponds to a local maximum.

From the first-order condition, we know that at $\\alpha}^{*}$, $\\frac{1}{\\gamma+\\alpha^{*}} = \\frac{k}{\\alpha^{*}}$. Substituting this into the second derivative expression:\n$$\\frac{d^2L}{d\\alpha^2}\\bigg|_{\\alpha=\\alpha^{*}} = -\\frac{k}{(\\alpha^{*})^2} + \\left(\\frac{k}{\\alpha^{*}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{k^2}{(\\alpha^{*})^2} - \\frac{k}{(\\alpha^{*})^2} = \\frac{k^2 - k}{(\\alpha^{*})^2} = \\frac{k(k-1)}{(\\alpha^{*})^2}$$\nFor the critical point to be a local maximum, the second derivative must be negative. Since $k > 0$ and $(\\alpha^{*})^2 > 0$, the sign of the second derivative is determined by the sign of the term $(k-1)$.\n$$\\frac{d^2L}{d\\alpha^2}\\bigg|_{\\alpha=\\alpha^{*}} < 0 \\quad \\iff \\quad k(k-1) < 0 \\quad \\iff \\quad k-1 < 0 \\quad \\iff \\quad k < 1$$\nThis confirms that the condition $0 < k < 1$ is sufficient for the critical point $\\alpha^{*}$ to be a local maximum.\n\nTo ensure it is a global maximum on $(0, \\infty)$, we analyze the behavior of $R_{0}(\\alpha)$ at the boundaries.\nFor $\\alpha \\to 0^{+}$, $R_{0}(\\alpha) \\to 0$ since $k>0$.\nFor $\\alpha \\to \\infty$, $R_{0}(\\alpha) = \\frac{b\\alpha^{k}}{\\gamma+\\alpha} \\sim b\\alpha^{k-1}$.

By analyzing the experimental design and its results, you will practice the critical skill of linking theoretical hypotheses to empirical evidence.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist designed an experiment to test the hypothesis that transmission mode influences the evolution of parasite virulence. The hypothesis states that obligate horizontal transmission, where a parasite must spread to new, unrelated hosts, selects for higher virulence compared to a transmission mode where the parasite's lineage is tied to the survival of its current host group.\n\nThe experiment used a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria) and its susceptible bacterial host, *Escherichia coli*. The biologist established two sets of experimental lines, each replicated multiple times. In all lines, a flask of nutrient broth was inoculated with *E. coli* and allowed to grow to a standard density. Then, a stock of the ancestral bacteriophage was introduced. The lines were then propagated for 100 transfer cycles using one of two methods:\n\n1.  **Horizontal Transmission (HT) Treatment:** After the phage had infected and lysed the majority of the bacterial culture in a flask, the culture was filtered to remove all remaining bacteria. A small, standardized volume of this bacteria-free filtrate, containing only phage particles, was then transferred to a new flask of fresh, uninfected *E. coli*.\n\n2.  **Mixed Transmission (MT) Treatment:** After the phage had infected the bacterial culture, but before complete lysis, a small, standardized volume of the entire culture—containing phage, infected bacteria, and some surviving uninfected bacteria—was transferred to a new flask containing fresh nutrient broth (but no new bacteria).\n\nVirulence was defined as the ability of the phage to harm its host. Operationally, it was measured by taking a phage sample from a given line and using it to infect a standard culture of the ancestral, unevolved *E. coli*. The time required for the phage to reduce the optical density of this standard culture by 50% was recorded. A shorter time indicates higher virulence.\n\nAfter 100 transfer cycles, the average virulence of the phage populations was assayed. Phage evolved under the HT treatment had an average 50% lysis time of 38 minutes. Phage evolved under the MT treatment had an average 50% lysis time of 85 minutes.\n\nBased on the design and results of this experiment, which of the following conclusions is best supported?\n\nA. The hypothesis is supported, as the experimental treatment modeling obligate horizontal transmission resulted in the evolution of higher phage virulence.\n\nB. The hypothesis is refuted, as the experimental treatment modeling obligate horizontal transmission resulted in the evolution of lower phage virulence.\n\nC. The experiment is flawed because a control group in which the phage was not transferred was not included, making the results inconclusive.\n\nD. The results support an alternative hypothesis that limiting host availability, as in the MT treatment, selects for higher phage virulence.\n\nE. The hypothesis is refuted because both treatments resulted in an increase in virulence compared to the ancestral phage, which had a lysis time of 95 minutes.", "solution": "We start by specifying the operational measure of virulence used in the experiment: virulence is inversely related to the time taken for a phage population to reduce the optical density of a standard ancestral host culture by 0.5. Formally, if $T$ is the time to achieve a 0.5 reduction, then higher virulence corresponds to smaller $T$.\n\nThe hypothesis states that obligate horizontal transmission selects for higher virulence than a mode tying parasite fitness to the survival of its current host group. The HT treatment models obligate horizontal transmission by transferring only free phage to new, naive hosts. The MT treatment models a regime in which the parasite lineage is partially tied to the current host group by transferring a mixture including infected cells and some surviving uninfected cells into fresh medium without adding new hosts, thereby aligning parasite success more with host group persistence.\n\nAfter evolution for 100 transfers, the observed average lysis times were:\n- HT-evolved phage: $T_{\\mathrm{HT}}=38$ minutes,\n- MT-evolved phage: $T_{\\mathrm{MT}}=85$ minutes.\n\nSince virulence increases as $T$ decreases, the inequality $38  85$ implies that the HT treatment produced higher virulence than the MT treatment. This directly matches the directional prediction of the hypothesis.\n\nWe evaluate the answer options:\n- Option A asserts that the hypothesis is supported because the obligate horizontal transmission treatment yielded higher virulence. This is consistent with $T_{\\mathrm{HT}}  T_{\\mathrm{MT}}$.\n- Option B incorrectly claims lower virulence under HT, contrary to the observed $38  85$.\n- Option C claims a flaw due to the absence of a no-transfer control. However, the hypothesis concerns the relative effect of transmission mode on evolved virulence; the experimental design includes appropriate comparative treatments, so the conclusion about relative virulence is valid without a no-transfer control.\n- Option D asserts that limiting host availability in MT selects for higher virulence, which contradicts the observed ordering since MT evolved lower virulence (larger $T$).\n- Option E concludes the hypothesis is refuted because both treatments increased virulence relative to an ancestral lysis time of $95$ minutes; however, the hypothesis is about the relative difference between treatments, not absolute change from the ancestor.
