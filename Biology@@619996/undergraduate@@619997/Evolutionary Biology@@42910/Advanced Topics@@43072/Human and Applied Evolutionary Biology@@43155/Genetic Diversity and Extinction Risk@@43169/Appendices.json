A more crucial metric for conservation is the effective population size ($N_e$), which reflects the rate of genetic drift. This practice demonstrates how to calculate $N_e$ in a common real-world scenario where breeding is not evenly distributed between males and females, highlighting the often dramatic difference between how many individuals exist and how many are contributing to the next generation's gene pool [@problem_id:1933495].", "problem": "A team of conservation biologists is studying the population of the critically endangered Kaelan Island deer, a species found only on a remote island. The total census population size, $N_c$, is stable at 500 individuals. However, due to a complex social structure and skewed resource access, not all individuals breed. Each breeding season, observations confirm that only 20 males and 100 females successfully reproduce. The effective population size, $N_e$, is a measure of the size of an idealized population that would experience the same amount of genetic drift as the actual population. For a population with unequal numbers of breeding males and females, this is a more accurate indicator of genetic health than the census size.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the effective population size to the census population size, $N_e / N_c$.

This scenario explores how intense directional selection, such as for insecticide resistance, can create a severe population bottleneck that purges a massive amount of standing genetic variation. By working through this conceptual problem, you will see how a selective sweep can leave a population genetically impoverished and vulnerable to extinction from completely new threats, a key concept in understanding the extinction vortex [@problem_id:1933505].", "problem": "A large, genetically diverse population of mosquitos lives in a stable wetland environment. A new, potent insecticide is introduced into the area, creating an intense selective pressure. A very small fraction of the initial population possesses a specific allele, `Res-A`, which confers complete resistance to the insecticide. Over a few generations, the mosquito population crashes and then rebounds, composed almost entirely of individuals homozygous for the `Res-A` allele. Sometime later, a novel fungal pathogen, to which the mosquitos have no prior exposure, is introduced into the wetlands and begins to cause high mortality. Scientists observe that the new, insecticide-resistant population shows a drastically reduced ability to adapt to this fungal threat compared to what would be expected from the original, pre-insecticide population, leading to a high risk of extinction.\n\nWhich of the following statements best explains the primary evolutionary mechanism responsible for the population's increased vulnerability to the fungal pathogen?\n\nA. The intense selection for the `Res-A` allele resulted in a population bottleneck, which drastically reduced the overall genetic variation, including the variation in immune-related genes necessary to combat the new pathogen.\n\nB. The `Res-A` allele exhibits negative pleiotropy, meaning the same gene that provides insecticide resistance also directly causes a weakened immune response to fungal infections.\n\nC. The insecticide is a mutagen that permanently lowered the overall mutation rate in the mosquito population, preventing the generation of new alleles that could confer resistance to the fungus.\n\nD. Surviving mosquitoes must allocate a significant portion of their metabolic energy to maintaining insecticide resistance, leaving insufficient energy for an effective immune response.\n\nE. The fungal pathogen evolved specific mechanisms to target mosquitoes carrying the `Res-A` allele, as these were the most abundant hosts in the environment.", "solution": "1. Start with the initial condition: a large, genetically diverse mosquito population implies high standing genetic variation across the genome, including loci affecting immunity. High standing variation increases the probability that alleles conferring resistance to novel challenges (e.g., a fungal pathogen) are already present or can be assembled by recombination.\n\n2. The introduction of a potent insecticide imposes intense directional selection favoring the rare allele Res-A. Because only a very small fraction of individuals carry Res-A, most of the population dies, producing a severe reduction in census size and effective population size $N_{e}$. This constitutes a population bottleneck.\n\n3. The subsequent rebound from a few survivors creates a founder effect and a selective sweep centered on the Res-A locus. Both the bottleneck and the sweep reduce genome-wide genetic variation via genetic drift and the loss of many alleles, including at loci unrelated to insecticide resistance. Elevated homozygosity and reduced heterozygosity are expected consequences.\n\n4. When a novel fungal pathogen is introduced, adaptive response requires either standing genetic variation in immune-related genes or the rapid appearance and fixation of beneficial new mutations. Because the bottleneck and sweep have drastically reduced standing variation and $N_{e}$, the population’s adaptive capacity is impaired: fewer immune variants exist to be selected, and the rate of appearance and fixation of new beneficial mutations is reduced by smaller $N_{e}$ and stronger drift.\n\n5. Therefore, the primary evolutionary mechanism explaining the increased vulnerability is the loss of genetic diversity due to the bottleneck/selective sweep, especially at immune-related loci. This directly accounts for the observed “drastically reduced ability to adapt.”\n\n6. Evaluation of alternatives:\n- A matches the mechanism of a bottleneck reducing overall and immune-related genetic variation, thereby reducing adaptive potential to a novel pathogen.\n- B invokes negative pleiotropy of Res-A, which would cause a direct physiological susceptibility, not primarily a reduced evolutionary adaptability; there is no evidence provided for such pleiotropy, and the key observation concerns reduced adaptability.\n- C posits a lowered mutation rate from a mutagenic insecticide, which is biologically implausible and unnecessary to explain the pattern; mutation supply is rarely the sole constraint in the immediate aftermath of a severe bottleneck.\n- D describes a physiological energy trade-off, which could affect individual immunity but does not explain the population-level reduction in evolutionary adaptability.\n- E requires rapid, specific counter-adaptation by the pathogen targeting Res-A hosts; while possible in some host-pathogen coevolution scenarios, it does not explain the fundamental loss of adaptive capacity due to reduced genetic variation.\n\n7. Hence, the best explanation is the population bottleneck and consequent loss of genetic diversity, as stated in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1933505"}, {"introduction": "Modern genomics provides powerful tools for assessing the health of endangered populations. This exercise introduces the concept of Runs of Homozygosity (ROH), which are long stretches of identical DNA that serve as clear signatures of recent inbreeding. You will learn how to translate this genomic data into an inbreeding coefficient, $F$, and then use it to quantify the increased risk of a specific genetic disorder, demonstrating a direct link between an individual's genome and its population's extinction risk [@problem_id:1933493].", "problem": "A conservation genetics team is studying two isolated populations of the endangered Siberian Crested Antelope: the Altai population and the Tien Shan population. Genome sequencing was performed on representative individuals from each population to assess their genetic health. A key metric analyzed was the presence of long Runs of Homozygosity (ROH), which are extended stretches of the genome where an individual is homozygous at all sites. These regions are often indicative of recent inbreeding, where parents share a recent common ancestor.\n\nThe analysis provides the following data:\n- The total length of the autosomal genome for this species is $L_{genome} = 2.50 \\times 10^9$ base pairs.\n- The average total length of ROH across the autosomal genome for an individual from the Altai population is $L_{ROH, Altai} = 1.95 \\times 10^8$ base pairs.\n- The average total length of ROH across the autosomal genome for an individual from the Tien Shan population is $L_{ROH, Tien Shan} = 4.65 \\times 10^8$ base pairs.\n\nThe genomic inbreeding coefficient, $F$, for an individual can be estimated as the fraction of the autosomal genome found within ROH, i.e., $F = L_{ROH} / L_{genome}$.\n\nA known lethal genetic disorder in this species, Cryogenic Hypometabolism Syndrome (CHS), is caused by a single recessive allele 'c'. The frequency of this allele in the large, ancestral metapopulation from which both groups derive was estimated to be $q = 0.015$. The presence of this disorder in homozygous recessive individuals (cc) leads to mortality before reaching reproductive age. The frequency of affected individuals in a population with an inbreeding coefficient $F$ is given by the expression $q^2(1-F) + qF$.\n\nTo quantify the heightened genetic risk in the more-inbred population, calculate a relative risk factor. This factor is defined as the ratio of the *increase* in the incidence of CHS in the Tien Shan population to the *increase* in the incidence of CHS in the Altai population.
