This pattern is explained by a 'serial founder effect,' where each successive migration carries away only a fraction of the source population's genetic variation. This exercise allows you to quantitatively model this process and understand how rapidly diversity is lost during a chain of migration events [@problem_id:1973164].", "problem": "The \"Out of Africa\" hypothesis posits that modern humans originated in Africa and subsequently migrated to populate the rest of the world. A key genetic signature of this expansion is the serial founder effect, where successive migrations out of existing populations result in a stepwise reduction of genetic diversity with increasing geographic distance from Africa.\n\nConsider a simplified quantitative model of this process. Let the genetic diversity of a population be measured by its average heterozygosity, $H$. An ancestral population in Africa has an initial heterozygosity $H_0$. A small group of founders migrates to establish a new population. This founding event acts as a genetic bottleneck. The expected heterozygosity of the newly founded population, $H_{new}$, is related to the heterozygosity of its source population, $H_{source}$, by the formula:\n$$H_{new} = H_{source} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right)$$\nwhere $N$ is the effective population size of the small founding group.\n\nAssume human migration out of Africa occurred as a chain of discrete founding events. In each event, a small group of founders with an effective population size of $N=50$ branched off to colonize a new territory. After each such event, the newly established population grew and eventually served as the source for the next migration.

Evidence of interbreeding between anatomically modern humans and archaic hominins like Neanderthals forces us to reconsider long-held definitions. This practice challenges you to apply the genetic evidence of admixture to the Biological Species Concept, a cornerstone of evolutionary theory, and explore the fuzzy boundaries between ancient human groups [@problem_id:1973124].", "problem": "The Biological Species Concept (BSC) is a cornerstone of evolutionary biology, defining a species as a group of organisms that can naturally interbreed and produce viable, fertile offspring. For a long time, paleoanthropologists classified *Homo sapiens* and *Homo neanderthalensis* as distinct species based on clear morphological differences in their skeletal remains. However, advances in ancient DNA analysis have shown that the genomes of modern non-African human populations contain approximately 1-4% Neanderthal-derived DNA. This genetic contribution indicates that when anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa, they encountered and successfully interbred with Neanderthal populations. Critically, the persistence of this DNA in the modern human gene pool implies that the resulting hybrid offspring were fertile and were integrated into human populations.\n\nGiven this genetic evidence and the formal definition of the Biological Species Concept, which of the following statements provides the most accurate interpretation of the relationship between *Homo sapiens* and Neanderthals?\n\nA. The evidence suggests that the reproductive isolation between the two groups was incomplete, challenging their classification as entirely separate species under a strict interpretation of the Biological Species Concept.\n\nB. Since the amount of Neanderthal DNA in modern humans is very small (1-4%), the interbreeding events were statistically rare and therefore biologically insignificant, confirming that *Homo sapiens* and Neanderthals were unequivocally separate species.\n\nC. The genetic evidence is irrelevant to the Biological Species Concept, which is a theoretical model that cannot be applied to fossil species, only to living populations that can be directly observed.\n\nD. This evidence proves that the \"Out of Africa\" model of human origins is incorrect and should be replaced by a model where modern humans evolved simultaneously from archaic populations in multiple regions.\n\nE. The production of any hybrid offspring is common between closely related species and does not challenge the Biological Species Concept as long as those hybrids had lower average fitness, a form of postzygotic isolation.", "solution": "Step 1: State the Biological Species Concept (BSC).\n- Under the BSC, a species is defined as a group of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups. The key criterion is the presence or absence of reproductive isolation, particularly whether interbreeding produces viable, fertile offspring in nature.\n\nStep 2: Interpret the genetic evidence under the BSC.\n- The finding that modern non-African humans carry approximately 0.01 to 0.04 of their genomes derived from Neanderthals indicates historical gene flow between anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals.\n- The persistence of Neanderthal-derived alleles in present-day humans implies that hybrid offspring were not only viable but also fertile, since alleles introgressed and were transmitted across generations.\n- Therefore, reproductive isolation between the groups was incomplete. Under a strict reading of the BSC, complete reproductive isolation is required to classify two groups as entirely separate species.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option against the BSC and the evidence.\n- Option A: Correct. It directly reflects that documented gene flow and fertile hybrids indicate incomplete reproductive isolation, which challenges a strict designation of entirely separate species under the BSC.\n- Option B: Incorrect. The proportion of introgressed DNA being small does not negate interbreeding or fertility; any sustained gene flow contradicts complete reproductive isolation. The BSC does not specify a quantitative threshold of introgression below which groups remain unequivocally separate species.\n- Option C: Incorrect. While the BSC is challenging to apply to fossil taxa, ancient DNA provides direct evidence of historical gene flow and hybrid fertility, which is precisely relevant to the BSC criterion of reproductive compatibility.\n- Option D: Incorrect. The evidence supports an “Out of Africa” model with limited admixture (a “leaky replacement” or assimilation model), not simultaneous regional evolution. It does not refute the African origin of modern humans.\n- Option E: Incorrect or misleading. The BSC is challenged when fertile hybrids occur in nature, particularly when introgressed alleles persist, indicating that hybrids contributed genetically to subsequent generations. Even if some hybrids had reduced average fitness, the observed persistence of Neanderthal DNA demonstrates that postzygotic isolation was not complete and thus does challenge a strict BSC separation.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion.\n- The most accurate interpretation, given the BSC and the genetic evidence of introgression and fertile hybrids, is that reproductive isolation was incomplete, challenging the classification of the two as entirely separate species under a strict BSC.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1973124"}, {"introduction": "How do scientists decide between two competing, complex stories about the past? This practice introduces you to the cutting-edge statistical methods used in modern population genetics to test demographic hypotheses.

A key debate centers on the nature of the ancestral African population that gave rise to this group during the Out of Africa migration event. Two competing hypotheses have been proposed:\n\n*   **Model 1: The Single Source (SS) Model.** This model posits that the migrant population originated from a single, large, and genetically well-mixed (panmictic) ancestral African population.\n*   **Model 2: The Admixed Source (AS) Model.** This model proposes that the migrant population was formed by a recent admixture event between two distinct ancestral African sub-populations that had been genetically isolated from each other for a significant period.\n\nTo distinguish between these two models, researchers employed an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) rejection-sampling analysis. They first calculated a vector of four genetic summary statistics from the genomic data of the newly discovered population. Then, they simulated 1,000,000 datasets under the SS model and 1,000,000 datasets under the AS model, drawing model parameters (like effective population sizes and divergence times) from wide prior distributions. For each simulated dataset, they calculated the same vector of summary statistics.\n\nA simulation was \"accepted\" if the Euclidean distance between its summary statistics vector and the observed summary statistics vector was below a small tolerance threshold, $\\epsilon$.

For two competing models, $M_{SS}$ and $M_{AS}$, the ratio of their posterior probabilities (the posterior odds) is related to the ratio of their prior probabilities (the prior odds) and the ratio of their marginal likelihoods (the Bayes Factor).\n\nThe relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{P(M_{AS} | \\text{Data})}{P(M_{SS} | \\text{Data})} = \\frac{P(\\text{Data} | M_{AS})}{P(\\text{Data} | M_{SS})} \\times \\frac{P(M_{AS})}{P(M_{SS})}\n$$\nThis can be stated as: Posterior Odds = Bayes Factor $\\times$ Prior Odds.\n\nLet's calculate each term.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Prior Odds**\n\nThe problem provides the prior probabilities for the two models:\n$P(M_{SS}) = 0.75$\n$P(M_{AS}) = 0.25$\n\nThe prior odds in favor of the Admixed Source (AS) model over the Single Source (SS) model are:\n$$\n\\text{Prior Odds}_{AS,SS} = \\frac{P(M_{AS})}{P(M_{SS})} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Bayes Factor**\n\nThe Bayes Factor, $BF_{AS,SS}$, is the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of the data under each model, $P(\\text{Data} | M_{AS}) / P(\\text{Data} | M_{SS})$. In an ABC framework, the marginal likelihood $P(\\text{Data} | M_i)$ is intractable to compute directly.
