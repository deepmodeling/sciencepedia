This exercise introduces the D-statistic, or ABBA-BABA test, a powerful method for distinguishing true introgression from incomplete lineage sorting, which are confounding signals of shared ancestry. By applying this test to hypothetical data, you will gain hands-on experience in calculating and interpreting one of the most fundamental metrics in paleogenomics, allowing you to quantify the relative strength of admixture signals from different archaic hominins. [@problem_id:1950320]", "problem": "In paleogenomics, the D-statistic, or ABBA-BABA test, is a powerful tool for detecting ancient gene flow (introgression) between populations. The test analyzes patterns of shared derived alleles across four genomes: two modern human populations (P1 and P2), a potentially introgressing archaic hominin population (P3), and an outgroup (O), such as a chimpanzee. The population tree is assumed to be `(((P1, P2), P3), O)`.\n\nA site in the genome is designated 'A' if it carries the ancestral allele (the same as the outgroup O) and 'B' if it carries a derived allele. The test counts two types of sites:\n1.  **ABBA sites**: P1 has the ancestral allele, while P2 and P3 share the derived allele.\n2.  **BABA sites**: P2 has the ancestral allele, while P1 and P3 share the derived allele.\n\nUnder a scenario of no gene flow, random genetic drift and incomplete lineage sorting should produce roughly equal numbers of ABBA and BABA sites. An excess of ABBA sites suggests gene flow between P2 and P3.\n\nAn ancient DNA lab analyzes the genome of a newly sequenced individual from an ancient Siberian population (P2). They wish to quantify the relative contributions of Neanderthal and Denisovan ancestry. They perform two separate D-statistic analyses using the Yoruba population as P1 (a population with minimal archaic admixture) and the chimpanzee genome as the outgroup O.\n\nThe site counts are as follows:\n- **Analysis 1 (with Altai Neanderthal as P3):**\n  - Number of ABBA sites = 105,000\n  - Number of BABA sites = 100,000\n\n- **Analysis 2 (with Denisovan as P3):**\n  - Number of ABBA sites = 115,000\n  - Number of BABA sites = 100,000\n\nUsing these data, calculate the ratio of the Denisovan-admixture signal strength to the Neanderthal-admixture signal strength in this ancient Siberian individual.
