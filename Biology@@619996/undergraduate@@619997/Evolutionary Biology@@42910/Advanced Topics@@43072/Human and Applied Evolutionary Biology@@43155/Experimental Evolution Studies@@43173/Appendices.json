To do this, they design a serial propagation experiment. They begin with a large, genetically uniform population of plants, each having an identical baseline toxin resistance level of $R_0$.\n\nThe experiment consists of two parallel selection lines, A and B, which are propagated for $N$ generations in an environment containing a toxin.\n\n1.  **Line A (Combined Somatic and Organismal Selection):** Propagation in this line is performed using large vegetative cuttings (ramets). The size of these cuttings allows for competition among somatic cell lineages within each plant. This process of within-organism evolution is modeled as increasing the average resistance of the plant's tissues by a fixed amount, $\\Delta R_{Somatic}$, over the course of a single generation. This increase occurs before the end-of-generation selection of whole plants.\n\n2.  **Line B (Organismal Selection Only):** Propagation in this line is performed using single-meristem cuttings. This method ensures that each new plant is derived from a tiny, uniform tissue source. This effectively prevents any gains from within-organism evolution from being passed on to the next generation.\n\nIn both lines, at the end of each generation, a portion of the plant population is selected to parent the next generation based on their overall performance. This process of between-organism selection is modeled as increasing the mean resistance of the selected group by a multiplicative factor of $(1+\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha$ is the organismal selection coefficient.\n\nAfter $N$ generations, the mean resistance in Line A is $R_N^{(A)}$ and in Line B is $R_N^{(B)}$. The total adaptive gain in Line A is defined as $G_{total} = R_N^{(A)} - R_0$. The adaptive gain attributable purely to organismal selection is given by the total change in the control line, $G_{organismal} = R_N^{(B)} - R_0$. The adaptive gain attributable to somatic selection is the additional gain observed in Line A, such that $G_{somatic} = G_{total} - G_{organismal}$.\n\nYour task is to calculate the proportion of the total adaptive gain in Line A that is attributable to somatic selection.
