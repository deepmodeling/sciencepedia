By analyzing a hypothetical public health scenario, you will apply principles of gene-culture coevolution to understand why a food that is nutritious for some populations can cause health issues in others [@problem_id:1947447].", "problem": "An international Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) has initiated a nutritional aid program for a remote, isolated island community. The traditional diet of this population consists primarily of fish, starchy root vegetables, and fruits. Historically, this community has never practiced pastoralism (the domestication of animals for milk). The NGO's program involves distributing fortified powdered cow's milk to children and adults to supplement their protein and calcium intake. However, within weeks of the program's launch, local health workers report a high incidence of digestive complaints—including bloating, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea—among those who consume the milk.\n\nWhich of the following hypotheses provides the most scientifically sound evolutionary explanation for this widespread health issue?\n\nA. The community's ancestors did not consume milk past infancy, so there was no selective pressure to favor the continued production of the enzyme that digests milk sugar into adulthood. Consequently, many individuals in the population are genetically programmed to stop producing this enzyme after childhood.\n\nB. The proteins in cow's milk are foreign to the islanders, whose immune systems have not been previously exposed to them. This novelty triggers a widespread, low-grade allergic reaction in the gut, leading to inflammation and digestive distress.\n\nC. The introduction of dairy has caused a rapid and disruptive shift in the gut-microbiome composition of the islanders. The new diet favors the proliferation of bacterial species that are inefficient at digestion and produce excessive gas as a metabolic byproduct.\n\nD. The community lacks a cultural history of preparing dairy products safely. The powdered milk is likely being reconstituted with contaminated water, leading to a widespread outbreak of a waterborne gastrointestinal pathogen.\n\nE. The high concentration of fat and calories in cow's milk represents a significant metabolic shock to the islanders' digestive systems, which are evolutionarily adapted to a lower-fat diet. This sudden overload overwhelms the digestive tract's absorptive capacity.", "solution": "The reported symptoms—bloating, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea—occurring specifically after consumption of cow’s milk are classic for lactose malabsorption leading to lactose intolerance. The physiological mechanism is that lactose, the disaccharide in milk, requires the brush-border enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (commonly referred to as lactase) for hydrolysis into glucose and galactose in the small intestine. In individuals with low lactase activity, undigested lactose proceeds to the colon, where colonic bacteria ferment it, producing gas (hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide) that leads to bloating and cramps, and generating an osmotic load that draws water into the lumen, causing diarrhea.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, in most mammals (and in most human populations historically), lactase expression declines after weaning. Persistent high lactase expression into adulthood (lactase persistence) is a derived trait maintained by positive selection in populations that culturally adopted pastoralism and dairying; this gene-culture coevolution is well-documented. In human groups without a history of pastoralism, lactase nonpersistence is common, meaning many adults downregulate lactase after childhood and thus experience lactose intolerance when exposed to fresh milk.\n\nApplying this to the island community: their traditional subsistence diet lacked dairy and there is no cultural history of pastoralism. Therefore, there would have been no selective pressure favoring alleles that maintain lactase expression into adulthood. Consequently, a high prevalence of lactase nonpersistence is expected, making widespread lactose intolerance the most scientifically sound evolutionary explanation for the observed complaints after milk introduction.\n\nEvaluating the alternatives:\n- Option B (milk protein allergy) is unlikely as a widespread adult phenomenon and would more typically involve immune-mediated features; it does not provide an evolutionary mechanism consistent with population-level prevalence tied to subsistence history.\n- Option C (microbiome shift) could contribute to symptoms but is not primarily an evolutionary explanation and does not specifically account for the strong association between non-dairying histories and adult lactose intolerance.\n- Option D (contaminated water) is an infectious disease explanation rather than an evolutionary one and would not specifically link symptoms to milk consumption or to the subsistence history; it would also likely present with systemic features and affect non-milk consumers using the same water.\n- Option E (fat/calorie overload) is not supported as a general mechanism producing this symptom cluster in a population and does not match the well-established evolutionary and physiological basis of lactose intolerance.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically sound evolutionary explanation is that many adults in this population are lactase nonpersistent due to lack of historical dairying, as described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1947447"}, {"introduction": "Our bodies are equipped with ancient physiological responses, such as the \"fight-or-flight\" mechanism, which evolved to handle acute physical threats. In the modern world, psychological stressors can trigger this same energy-mobilizing cascade without any physical exertion to follow.
