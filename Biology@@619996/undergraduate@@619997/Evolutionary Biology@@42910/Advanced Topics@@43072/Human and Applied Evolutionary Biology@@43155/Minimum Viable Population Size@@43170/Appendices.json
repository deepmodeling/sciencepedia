A more meaningful metric is the effective population size ($N_e$), which reflects the actual number of individuals contributing genes to the next generation. This practice illustrates how a skewed breeding sex ratio, a common phenomenon in nature, can dramatically reduce the effective size of a population, making it more susceptible to the loss of genetic diversity [@problem_id:1947207].", "problem": "A team of marine biologists is studying an isolated population of a recently discovered species of deep-sea anglerfish, *Cryptospectrus luminosus*. The total observed population, or census size ($N_c$), is counted to be 120 individuals. In this species, mating is highly selective due to intense competition among males. Over a full breeding season, the research team's underwater drones observe that only 8 males successfully mate with the females. In contrast, 62 females in the population are found to carry fertilized eggs, indicating they have successfully reproduced. The remaining individuals in the population do not participate in breeding during this season.\n\nThe genetic health and susceptibility of a population to phenomena like genetic drift are more accurately reflected by its Effective Population Size ($N_e$) than by its simple census size.

Events like population crashes, or \"bottlenecks,\" can leave a lasting genetic scar long after the census numbers have recovered. This practice will guide you through calculating the long-term effective population size ($N_e$) for a population that has fluctuated in size, demonstrating why the harmonic mean is used and how it reveals the profound and persistent impact of past bottlenecks on genetic diversity [@problem_id:1947184].", "problem": "A team of conservation biologists is assessing the genetic health of a recovering sea otter population. The current census population size is 200 individuals. Historical data reveals that this population was established from a very small founder group.

The effective population size is a theoretical measure representing the size of an idealized population that would experience the same amount of random genetic drift as the actual population under study.\n\nCalculate the effective population size for this sea otter population across the three-generation history. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the effective population size, $N_e$, for a population that has experienced fluctuations in size over several generations. The appropriate way to calculate the long-term effective population size in such a scenario is to use the harmonic mean of the population sizes in each generation.\n\nLet $t$ be the number of generations, and let $N_i$ be the population size in generation $i$. The formula for the effective population size is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_e} = \\frac{1}{t} \\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\frac{1}{N_i} $$\n\nIn this problem, we are given the population sizes for $t=3$ generations:\n- Generation 1: $N_1 = 10$\n- Generation 2: $N_2 = 50$\n- Generation 3: $N_3 = 200$\n\nFirst, we substitute these values into the formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_e} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_1} + \\frac{1}{N_2} + \\frac{1}{N_3} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_e} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{200} \\right) $$\n\nTo sum the fractions inside the parentheses, we find a common denominator, which is 200.\n$$ \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{20}{200} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{4}{200} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{200} = \\frac{1}{200} $$\n\nNow, we substitute these back into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_e} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{20}{200} + \\frac{4}{200} + \\frac{1}{200} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_e} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{20 + 4 + 1}{200} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_e} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{25}{200} \\right) $$\n\nWe can simplify the fraction $\\frac{25}{200}$:\n$$ \\frac{25}{200} = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_e} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_e} = \\frac{1}{24} $$\n\nTo find $N_e$, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ N_e = 24 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The answer lies in their different life history strategies, which make them vulnerable to different types of threats. This practice challenges you to think critically about the two main perils of small populations: random demographic events and the steady erosion of genetic diversity. By comparing species with vastly different reproductive rates and generation times, you will develop a more nuanced understanding of which extinction risks are most urgent under different ecological contexts [@problem_id:1947178].", "problem": "Two isolated, identical wildlife preserves are established. Preserve A is stocked with a founding population of 40 African bush elephants (*Loxodonta africana*). Preserve B is stocked with a founding population of 40 field mice (*Apodemus sylvaticus*). Both populations are completely isolated from any other populations of their species, have a balanced initial sex ratio, and live in an environment free from major systematic pressures such as new diseases or habitat degradation.\n\nElephants are characterized by a long lifespan, a long time to sexual maturity (over 10 years), and low reproductive output (a single calf every 4-5 years). Mice are characterized by a short lifespan, rapid sexual maturity (a few months), and high reproductive output (multiple large litters per year).\n\nConsidering the intrinsic properties of these populations and their respective life history strategies, which of the following statements most accurately contrasts the single greatest and most immediate threat to the long-term persistence of each population?\n\nA. Both populations are primarily and equally threatened by the rapid loss of genetic diversity due to genetic drift, as both populations are small.\n\nB. The mouse population is primarily threatened by demographic stochasticity, while the elephant population is primarily threatened by the long-term loss of adaptive genetic variation.\n\nC. The elephant population is primarily threatened by demographic stochasticity, while the mouse population is primarily threatened by the long-term loss of adaptive genetic variation.\n\nD. Both populations are primarily threatened by environmental stochasticity, such as the possibility of a freak weather event, which would affect any small population regardless of species.\n\nE. The elephant population is primarily threatened by resource depletion within the preserve, while the mouse population is primarily threatened by the Allee effect.", "solution": "We identify the principal small-population extinction risks and how they scale with life history and time:\n1) Demographic stochasticity refers to random variation in births and deaths due to the probabilistic nature of reproduction and survival in finite populations. Its impact per unit time is amplified in species with low fecundity and delayed maturity, because the number of reproductive events per time is small, making zero-birth years or loss of a few breeders disproportionately consequential.\n2) Genetic drift causes loss of heterozygosity and adaptive genetic variation at a per-generation rate approximately $\\Delta H/H \\approx \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}$, where $N_{e}$ is the effective population size. Over $t$ generations, $H_{t} \\approx H_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\\right)^{t} \\approx H_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{2N_{e}}\\right)$. Converting to calendar time $\\tau$ with generation time $T_{g}$ gives $t = \\tau/T_{g}$ and hence $H(\\tau) \\approx H_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{2N_{e}T_{g}}\\right)$. Thus, for fixed $N_{e}$, shorter $T_{g}$ produces faster loss of genetic diversity per unit time.\n3) Environmental stochasticity reflects external fluctuations and can affect any population, but the prompt directs focus to intrinsic properties and life histories.\n4) Allee effects are mate- or cooperation-limited population growth at low density; with initial size $40$ and balanced sex ratio, severe Allee effects are less likely in mice and not the single greatest immediate risk for elephants either.\n5) Resource depletion requires population growth toward or beyond carrying capacity; with an initial founding size of $40$ and no evidence of immediate overuse, this is not the primary immediate threat.\n\nApply to each species:\n- Elephants: Long $T_{g}$, low fecundity, and few reproductive events per time make the population highly sensitive, in the immediate term, to demographic stochasticity. A few random adult mortalities or several years with no successful calves can push the growth rate negative. While genetic drift will occur, the long $T_{g}$ means the loss of genetic variation per unit time, $\\propto \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{2N_{e}T_{g}}\\right)$, proceeds relatively slowly.\n- Mice: Short $T_{g}$ and high fecundity buffer demographic stochasticity because many reproductive events occur per unit time, reducing the probability of zero births in a given period. However, the same short $T_{g}$ accelerates genetic drift per unit time, causing rapid loss of heterozygosity and adaptive variation in an isolated population of size $40$, making the genetic threat both immediate and substantial.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate contrast is that elephants are primarily and immediately threatened by demographic stochasticity, while mice are primarily and immediately threatened by the long-term (but rapid in calendar time due to short $T_{g}$) loss of adaptive genetic variation.\n\nThis matches option C and conflicts with A, B, D, and E: A incorrectly treats threats as equal; B inverts the species-specific vulnerabilities; D emphasizes extrinsic environmental stochasticity rather than intrinsic life-history-mediated risks; E misattributes primary threats (Allee effects are not the main risk for mice at $40$, and resource depletion is not the immediate limiting factor for elephants).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1947178"}]}
