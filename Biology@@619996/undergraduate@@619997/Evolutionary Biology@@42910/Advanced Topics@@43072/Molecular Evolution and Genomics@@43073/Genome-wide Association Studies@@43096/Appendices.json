The odds ratio is a fundamental statistic that quantifies the strength of an association by comparing the odds of an allele's presence in cases versus controls. This exercise will guide you through the calculation of an odds ratio from a hypothetical case-control study, building a core skill for interpreting GWAS results.

They conduct a case-control study to examine a potential association between a specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), a common type of genetic variation, and an individual's chronotype. This SNP has two known alleles in the population, designated 'T' and 'C'.\n\nThe study involves two groups of participants:\n1.  A group of 'cases' composed of individuals identified as \"evening chronotypes\".\n2.  A group of 'controls' composed of individuals identified as \"morning chronotypes\".\n\nThe genotyping results for the SNP are as follows:\n- In the group of evening chronotypes, it was found that 850 individuals carry the 'T' allele, while 1150 individuals carry the 'C' allele.\n- In the group of morning chronotypes, it was found that 750 individuals carry the 'T' allele, while 1450 individuals carry the 'C' allele.\n\nBased on this data, calculate the multiplicative factor by which the odds of possessing the 'T' allele (versus the 'C' allele) are different for an individual in the evening chronotype group compared to an individual in the morning chronotype group.

A GWAS involves scanning the genomes of many individuals to determine if any specific genetic variants are more frequent in people with the disease compared to a control group. The genetic variants being analyzed in this study are Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs).\n\nIn this particular study, the researchers are simultaneously testing $m = 1,000,000$ independent SNPs for a statistical association with the disorder. Conventionally, for a single statistical test, a p-value threshold (alpha level) for significance is set at $\\alpha = 0.05$. However, performing such a large number of tests significantly inflates the probability of obtaining at least one \"false positive\" result (a Type I error) purely by chance.\n\nTo counteract this multiple testing problem, the research team decides to control the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER), defined as the probability of making one or more Type I errors among all the tests performed. They aim to keep the FWER at or below 0.05. To achieve this, they will apply the Bonferroni correction to their significance threshold.\n\nGiven the number of independent SNPs being tested and the desired FWER, calculate the new, Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold that a single SNP must meet to be considered statistically significant.

[@problem_id:1494331]", "problem": "A large research consortium is conducting a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with \"Aero-Metabolic Syndrome\" (AMS), a complex respiratory disease. The study design involves `10,000` cases recruited from a network of specialized respiratory clinics and `10,000` controls selected from a general population health registry. To manage the large sample size efficiently, the genotyping process was distributed. DNA samples from all `10,000` cases were processed and genotyped for millions of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) using the \"BioArray v2.0\" platform at a central laboratory. Concurrently, DNA samples from all `10,000` controls were processed and genotyped using the \"GenoChip v3.5\" platform at a different facility.\n\nAfter the data from both platforms were merged and subjected to standard quality control, a statistical association test was performed for each SNP. The analysis revealed a striking result: tens of thousands of SNPs, distributed across every chromosome, showed a statistically significant association with AMS, far exceeding the typical findings for a complex disease GWAS.\n\nWhich of the following options provides the most plausible explanation for this genome-wide excess of significant associations?\n\nA. Population stratification: The case and control groups were drawn from populations with systematically different genetic ancestries, and these ancestry-related allele frequency differences are being misinterpreted as disease associations.\n\nB. Polygenic architecture: AMS is a highly polygenic disease, where its genetic risk is genuinely determined by the cumulative small effects of tens of thousands of common variants spread throughout the genome.\n\nC. Selection bias: Recruiting cases from specialized clinics resulted in a cohort with a more severe form of the disease, enriching for a large number of rare, high-impact variants not found in the general population controls.\n\nD. Systematic genotyping bias: The two different genotyping platforms have small, consistent, and platform-specific inaccuracies in allele measurement that, because they are perfectly correlated with the case-control labels, are creating widespread false-positive signals.\n\nE. Cryptic relatedness: The case group unknowingly contains a large number of closely related individuals, which violates the statistical assumption of sample independence and inflates association signals at loci shared within families.", "solution": "We formalize the per-SNP association test as either an allelic chi-square test or a logistic regression of case status on genotype. Let $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote case status, $G \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ the coded genotype, and consider for each SNP the null hypothesis $H_{0}: \\beta_{G} = 0$ in the logistic model $\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(Y=1 \\mid G)}{\\Pr(Y=0 \\mid G)}\\right) = \\alpha + \\beta_{G} G$. Under correct model specification and no confounding, the score or Wald test statistic has an asymptotic $\\chi^{2}_{1}$ distribution under $H_{0}$, so $p$-values across the genome should be approximately uniform under the null aside from a small number of true associations in a complex disease.\n\nThe observed pattern is a genome-wide excess of significant associations across every chromosome with tens of thousands of SNPs reaching significance. Such a pervasive inflation indicates a systematic deviation from the null that affects a very large fraction of SNPs. We examine each option by linking it to the test behavior.\n\nOption B (polygenic architecture): In a highly polygenic trait, many variants have small true effects. The power to detect a SNP at a stringent genome-wide threshold $\\alpha_{GW}$ (e.g., $\\alpha_{GW} \\approx 5 \\times 10^{-8}$) depends on the noncentrality parameter $\\Lambda$ of the association test. For an additive test, a standard approximation gives $\\Lambda \\approx N_{\\text{eff}} \\cdot 2 p (1 - p) \\cdot (\\ln \\theta)^{2}$, where $p$ is the minor allele frequency, $\\theta$ is the per-allele odds ratio, and $N_{\\text{eff}}$ is an effective sample size function of the case and control counts. For realistic complex traits with small $\\ln \\theta$, even large $N_{\\text{eff}}$ yields limited power at $\\alpha_{GW}$. Therefore, polygenicity alone does not generate tens of thousands of genome-wide significant hits with this sample size; it yields a polygenic signal detectable by methods like LD score regression or polygenic scores, not ubiquitous single-SNP significance.\n\nOption C (selection bias toward severity): Recruiting more severe cases might enrich for rare, high-impact variants. Arrays primarily target common variants; rare, severe alleles are often poorly tagged. Moreover, such enrichment does not create consistent allele frequency differences at common SNPs across the entire genome; it would not yield widespread false positives at common variants.\n\nOption E (cryptic relatedness): Relatedness violates independence, affecting variance estimates and inflating the test statistic if unmodeled. However, this inflation typically depends on sharing patterns and is not uniform across all SNPs; in practice it produces a modest, genome-wide inflation factor and sometimes localized signals, not tens of thousands of significant associations across all chromosomes. Furthermore, relatedness reduces the effective sample size, which usually decreases, rather than massively increases, the number of genome-wide significant hits after proper standard errors are used.\n\nOption A (population stratification): Systematic ancestry differences between cases and controls induce genome-wide allele frequency differences due to demographic history rather than disease, inflating association statistics across many SNPs. If uncorrected, this can plausibly create widespread significance. However, standard GWAS pipelines include adjustment for principal components of ancestry, which typically mitigates most stratification. While A could explain broad inflation, the study design provides a more direct and stronger source of confounding.\n\nOption D (systematic genotyping bias from different platforms): Here, genotyping platform is perfectly confounded with phenotype: all cases on BioArray v2.0 and all controls on GenoChip v3.5. Let $B \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote platform, with $B=1$ for cases and $B=0$ for controls. Let the true additive genotype be $G$, but the measured genotype be $\\tilde{G} = G + \\epsilon_{B}$, where $E[\\epsilon_{1}] \\neq E[\\epsilon_{0}]$ or the error distribution differs by platform due to differential calling, differential missingness, or probe chemistry. The expected difference in measured mean genotype between cases and controls is\n$$\nE[\\tilde{G} \\mid Y=1] - E[\\tilde{G} \\mid Y=0] = \\underbrace{E[G \\mid Y=1] - E[G \\mid Y=0]}_{\\Delta \\text{ (true effect)}} + \\underbrace{E[\\epsilon_{1}] - E[\\epsilon_{0}]}_{\\delta \\text{ (platform bias)}}.\n$$\nUnder the null for most SNPs, $\\Delta = 0$, but $\\delta \\neq 0$ whenever platform-specific calling bias exists. Because $B$ is perfectly collinear with $Y$, one cannot adjust for $B$ in the association model; omitted variable bias assigns platform-induced differences to the genotype coefficient, producing spurious associations. The test statistic for an allelic chi-square test is approximately\n$$\nT \\approx \\frac{\\left(\\hat{p}_{\\text{case}} - \\hat{p}_{\\text{control}}\\right)^{2}}{\\hat{V}},\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{p}_{\\text{case}}$ and $\\hat{p}_{\\text{control}}$ are observed allele frequencies and $\\hat{V}$ is the estimated variance under the null. If $\\hat{p}_{\\text{case}} - \\hat{p}_{\\text{control}} \\approx \\delta$ across many SNPs due to platform bias, then $T$ is inflated genome-wide. Unlike random non-differential measurement error, which attenuates associations, this is differential misclassification correlated with outcome status, which biases away from the null at many SNPs simultaneously, exactly matching the observed pattern of tens of thousands of significant hits across all chromosomes.\n\nGiven the specific design detail that all cases and controls were genotyped on different platforms at different facilities, systematic platform-specific genotyping bias that is perfectly correlated with case-control status is the most plausible and direct explanation for the genome-wide excess of significant associations.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1494331"}]}
