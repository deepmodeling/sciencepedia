This allele is associated with enhanced cold-sensing and metabolic efficiency in sub-zero temperatures. While it's largely believed that this allele evolved uniquely within the polar bear lineage, a competing hypothesis suggests it was acquired via adaptive introgression from an extinct population of Irish brown bears during the last glacial maximum, when their habitats might have overlapped.\n\nTo test this introgression hypothesis, researchers use the Patterson's D-statistic. This statistical test is designed to detect ancient gene flow using biallelic Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from four populations arranged in a specific phylogenetic tree: `((P1, P2), P3), O`. For this study, the populations are defined as:\n- **P1**: A 'control' polar bear genome from the Chukchi Sea, a population geographically isolated from the potential introgression zone.\n- **P2**: The 'test' polar bear genome from the Svalbard archipelago, the population suspected of receiving the allele.\n- **P3**: An ancient genome reconstructed from a subfossil of an extinct Irish brown bear.\n- **O**: A modern American black bear genome, serving as the outgroup.\n\nThe D-statistic is calculated as $D = \\frac{N_{ABBA} - N_{BABA}}{N_{ABBA} + N_{BABA}}$, where 'A' represents the ancestral allele (as determined by the outgroup, O) and 'B' represents the derived allele.\n- $N_{ABBA}$ is the count of sites where the genomic pattern is (P1=A, P2=B, P3=B, O=A).\n- $N_{BABA}$ is the count of sites where the genomic pattern is (P1=B, P2=A, P3=B, O=A).\n\nA large positive D value would indicate an excess of shared derived alleles between P2 and P3, supporting the hypothesis of gene flow between the Irish brown bear and the Svalbard polar bear.\n\nIn a 250 kilobase (kb) genomic window centered on the $TRP\\text{-}M8$ locus, the analysis of SNP data yielded the following site pattern counts:\n- Number of ABBA sites: $N_{ABBA} = 812$\n- Number of BABA sites: $N_{BABA} = 235$\n- Number of BBAA sites (P1=B, P2=B, P3=A, O=A): $N_{BBAA} = 41$\n\nCalculate the value of the Patterson's D-statistic for this genomic region.

This allele confers dominant resistance to a common herbicide. Genetic mapping reveals that the $R$ allele is in extremely tight linkage with a deleterious recessive allele, $v$, at a nearby locus, which causes a measurable reduction in seed viability when homozygous ($vv$). The native herbicide-susceptible allele is $W$, which is linked to the wild-type viability allele, $V$. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume recombination between the resistance locus and the viability locus is negligible.\n\nTo quantify the evolutionary dynamics, a long-term study plot is established. Before any herbicide treatment, the initial frequency of the resistance allele $R$ is measured to be $p_0$. The field is then treated with the herbicide each growing season. The fitness of each genotype is determined relative to the resistant heterozygote. The susceptible homozygotes ($WW$) have a relative fitness of $w_{WW} = 1 - s_h$ due to the herbicide's effectiveness. The resistant heterozygotes ($RW$) are unaffected by the herbicide and have no viability reduction, so their relative fitness is set to the reference value, $w_{RW} = 1$. The resistant homozygotes ($RR$) survive the herbicide but suffer the recessive viability cost, giving them a relative fitness of $w_{RR} = 1 - s_v$.\n\nField data provides the following values:\n- The initial frequency of the resistance allele, $p_0 = 0.0200$.\n- The frequency of the resistance allele after one generation of selection, $p_1 = 0.1468$.\n- The selection coefficient against susceptible plants, $s_h = 0.900$.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the selection coefficient, $s_v$, which quantifies the reduction in fitness due to seed viability issues in homozygous resistant plants.

The endemic allele is denoted $Cyp9jX\\text{-A}$ (for Aeridor-adapted), and the ancestral colonizer allele is $Cyp9jX\\text{-T}$ (for Temperatus).
