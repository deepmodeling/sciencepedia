This advanced problem [@problem_id:1966934] explores the consequences of \"male-driven evolution,\" where mutation rates differ between sexes.

This difference is often attributed to the greater number of cell divisions in the male germline (spermatogenesis) compared to the female germline (oogenesis).\n\nConsider a large, randomly mating population of such a species with a stable 1:1 sex ratio. Let the mutation rate per nucleotide site per generation in the male germline be $\\mu_m$ and in the female germline be $\\mu_f$. The ratio of these rates is defined as $\\alpha = \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_f}$, where $\\alpha > 1$.\n\nAssuming that mutations at a particular gene locus are selectively neutral, derive an expression for the expected ratio of the rate of neutral substitution for an X-linked gene to the rate of neutral substitution for an autosomal gene. Express your answer as a function of $\\alpha$.", "solution": "The fundamental principle of the neutral theory of molecular evolution states that the rate of substitution ($k$) for neutral alleles is equal to the neutral mutation rate per gene copy per generation ($\\mu$). Therefore, to find the ratio of substitution rates, we must first determine the average mutation rate experienced by an autosomal gene and an X-linked gene.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the substitution rate for an autosomal gene ($k_A$).**\nAn autosomal gene is present in two copies in both males and females. In any given generation, an autosomal allele has an equal probability of having been inherited from a male parent or a female parent. Therefore, it spends half of its evolutionary history in male lineages and half in female lineages. The average mutation rate per generation for an autosomal gene, $\\mu_A$, is the simple arithmetic mean of the male and female mutation rates:\n$$ \\mu_A = \\frac{\\mu_m + \\mu_f}{2} $$\nAccording to the neutral theory, the rate of substitution for a neutral autosomal gene, $k_A$, is equal to this average mutation rate:\n$$ k_A = \\mu_A = \\frac{\\mu_m + \\mu_f}{2} $$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the substitution rate for an X-linked gene ($k_X$).**\nThe inheritance pattern of an X-linked gene differs from that of an autosomal gene. In a population with a 1:1 sex ratio, females are XX and males are XY. Let's consider the total pool of X chromosomes in the population. For every female with two X chromosomes, there is a male with one X chromosome. Thus, out of every three X chromosomes in the population, two are in females and one is in a male.\nThis means that an X-linked gene spends, on average, two-thirds of its time in female lineages and one-third of its time in male lineages.\nThe average mutation rate for an X-linked gene, $\\mu_X$, is a weighted average of the male and female mutation rates, with the weights corresponding to the proportion of time spent in each sex:\n$$ \\mu_X = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\mu_m + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\mu_f = \\frac{\\mu_m + 2\\mu_f}{3} $$\nThe neutral substitution rate for an X-linked gene, $k_X$, is equal to this weighted average mutation rate:\n$$ k_X = \\mu_X = \\frac{\\mu_m + 2\\mu_f}{3} $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the substitution rates, $\\frac{k_X}{k_A}$.**\nNow we can compute the ratio of the X-linked substitution rate to the autosomal substitution rate using the expressions derived in the previous steps:\n$$ \\frac{k_X}{k_A} = \\frac{\\frac{\\mu_m + 2\\mu_f}{3}}{\\frac{\\mu_m + \\mu_f}{2}} $$\nSimplifying this complex fraction gives:\n$$ \\frac{k_X}{k_A} = \\frac{2(\\mu_m + 2\\mu_f)}{3(\\mu_m + \\mu_f)} $$\n\n**Step 4: Express the ratio in terms of $\\alpha$.**\nThe problem defines the ratio of male-to-female mutation rates as $\\alpha = \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_f}$. We can write $\\mu_m = \\alpha \\mu_f$. Substituting this into our expression for the ratio of substitution rates:\n$$ \\frac{k_X}{k_A} = \\frac{2(\\alpha\\mu_f + 2\\mu_f)}{3(\\alpha\\mu_f + \\mu_f)} $$\nWe can factor out $\\mu_f$ from both the numerator and the denominator:\n$$ \\frac{k_X}{k_A} = \\frac{2\\mu_f(\\alpha + 2)}{3\\mu_f(\\alpha + 1)} $$\nThe term $\\mu_f$ cancels out, leaving the final expression for the ratio as a function of $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\frac{k_X}{k_A} = \\frac{2(\\alpha + 2)}{3(\\alpha + 1)} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2(\\alpha + 2)}{3(\\alpha + 1)}}$$", "id": "1966934"}]}
