This is particularly true in non-recombining genomes, such as mitochondrial DNA, where alleles are permanently linked. This exercise explores a classic scenario of Hill-Robertson interference, where a beneficial mutation's fate is sealed by the deleterious company it keeps, demonstrating how complete linkage can staunchly prevent adaptation [@problem_id:1937556].", "problem": "In a certain animal species, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited maternally and does not undergo recombination. A pre-existing, slightly deleterious mutation, denoted as $D$, is found in the mitochondrial population of this species. This mutation confers a selection coefficient of $s_d = -0.04$.\n\nWithin an individual, a new, beneficial mutation, denoted as $B$, arises spontaneously on a mitochondrion that already carries the deleterious mutation $D$. This new mutation provides a selective advantage, with a selection coefficient of $s_b = +0.03$. Assume that the fitness effects of these two mutations are additive.\n\nConsidering this new mitochondrial haplotype that carries both mutations $B$ and $D$, what is its most likely ultimate fate in the population under the influence of natural selection?\n\nA. The haplotype will be selected against and will eventually be eliminated from the population.\n\nB. The beneficial mutation is strong enough to overcome the deleterious one, so the haplotype will increase in frequency.\n\nC. The two mutations will effectively cancel each other out, making the haplotype selectively neutral and subject only to genetic drift.\n\nD. Over time, recombination will separate the beneficial and deleterious alleles, allowing the beneficial mutation to spread independently.\n\nE. Natural selection will act to fix the beneficial mutation while simultaneously repairing the deleterious one within the same lineage.", "solution": "Because mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited and does not undergo recombination, mitochondrial mutations are completely linked. Thus, if a new beneficial mutation $B$ arises on a mitochondrial genome that already carries a deleterious mutation $D$, selection acts on the combined haplotype rather than on the mutations independently.\n\nLet the baseline fitness of the wild-type haplotype be $w_{0} = 1$. For a mutation with selection coefficient $s$, the relative fitness is $w = 1 + s$. Given additivity of fitness effects, the haplotype carrying both $B$ and $D$ has fitness\n$$\nw_{BD} = 1 + s_{b} + s_{d}.\n$$\nWith $s_{b} = 0.03$ and $s_{d} = -0.04$, the combined selection coefficient is\n$$\ns_{BD} = s_{b} + s_{d} = 0.03 - 0.04 = -0.01,\n$$\nso that\n$$\nw_{BD} = 1 + s_{BD} = 1 - 0.01 < 1.\n$$\nTherefore, the $BD$ haplotype is slightly deleterious relative to the wild type and will be selected against. Because there is no recombination in mtDNA, the beneficial mutation $B$ cannot be separated from the deleterious background $D$, and natural selection cannot fix $B$ independently on that lineage. Consequently, the most likely ultimate fate of the $BD$ haplotype under natural selection is elimination from the population.\n\nOption D is incorrect because recombination does not occur in mtDNA. Option C is incorrect because the effects do not cancel; the net effect is negative. Option B is incorrect because the beneficial effect does not outweigh the deleterious effect. Option E is incorrect because natural selection does not repair deleterious mutations; it changes frequencies of existing variants.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1937556"}, {"introduction": "Having established how linkage can hinder adaptation, we now turn to the evolutionary solution: genetic recombination. In sexual populations, recombination shuffles alleles, breaking up disadvantageous combinations and bringing together advantageous ones from different lineages. This practice asks you to connect this principle to a tangible feature of the genome—chromosome number—to predict how quickly a species can adapt, thereby illustrating how genome architecture directly impacts the efficiency of natural selection in overcoming Hill-Robertson interference [@problem_id:1937574].", "problem": "Two closely related, sexually reproducing diploid plant species, Species A and Species B, are introduced to a new, isolated ecosystem. Both species have identical population sizes, generation times, mutation rates, and total genome sizes. The primary challenge in this new environment is a novel, rapidly evolving pathogen. Resistance to this pathogen is a complex trait, known to require the accumulation of multiple beneficial mutations at different, unlinked gene loci.\n\nThe key difference between the two species lies in their genome architecture:\n-   **Species A** has a haploid number of 12 chromosomes (2n = 24).\n-   **Species B** has a haploid number of 3 chromosomes (2n = 6).\n\nAssuming that beneficial mutations arise randomly throughout the genomes of both species, which species is more likely to adapt faster to the pathogen, and what is the primary evolutionary mechanism responsible for this difference?\n\nA. Species A will adapt faster because its higher chromosome number leads to a higher effective recombination rate, which reduces the negative effects of linkage (Hill-Robertson interference) and allows beneficial mutations to be combined more efficiently by natural selection.\n\nB. Species B will adapt faster because its lower chromosome number keeps beneficial mutations linked together into \"supergenes,\" ensuring they are passed on to offspring as a single adaptive unit, accelerating the response to selection.\n\nC. Species B will adapt faster because having fewer, larger chromosomes provides greater genetic stability and reduces the risk of aneuploidy during meiosis, ensuring that adaptive gene combinations are not lost.\n\nD. Both species will adapt at the same rate because adaptation speed is determined by mutation rate and population size, both of which are identical for the two species. The number of chromosomes is irrelevant.\n\nE. Species A will adapt faster because the smaller chromosomes are replicated more quickly during cell division, leading to a shorter cell cycle and thus a faster potential for population growth in response to favorable conditions.", "solution": "We are asked which of two otherwise identical sexually reproducing diploid plant species will adapt faster to a rapidly evolving pathogen, where adaptation requires multiple beneficial mutations at different, unlinked loci. The only difference between the species is chromosome number: Species A has haploid number $n_{A}=12$, Species B has haploid number $n_{B}=3$.\n\nKey evolutionary principles:\n1) Fisher-Muller effect and Hill-Robertson interference: In sexual populations, recombination accelerates adaptation by bringing together beneficial mutations that arise in different individuals or lineages. Linkage among selected sites causes Hill-Robertson interference, reducing the effective selection coefficients on those mutations and slowing their fixation. Increasing recombination reduces this interference and increases the efficiency of selection on multiple beneficial mutations.\n\n2) Genome-wide recombination scales with chromosome number: In meiosis, each bivalent typically experiences at least one crossover (the obligate chiasma). Let $C$ denote the expected number of crossovers per genome per meiosis, and let $n$ denote the haploid chromosome number. Then $C\\geq n$, so increasing $n$ increases the genome-wide recombination rate and reduces linkage across the genome. Thus, with $n_{A}=12$ and $n_{B}=3$, we have $C_{A}\\geq 12$ and $C_{B}\\geq 3$, implying $C_{A}>C_{B}$ and therefore a higher effective recombination rate in Species A.\n\n3) Probability that beneficial mutations are on the same chromosome decreases with chromosome number: Let the total genetic length of the genome be $L$ (in Morgans) and let $L_{k}$ be the genetic length of chromosome $k$, with $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} L_{k}=L$. If beneficial mutations arise uniformly at random along the genome, the probability that two independently arising beneficial mutations fall on the same chromosome is\n$$\np_{\\text{same}}=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\left(\\frac{L_{k}}{L}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nIf chromosomes are of similar size so that $L_{k}=L/n$ for all $k$, then\n$$\np_{\\text{same}}=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{1}{n}.\n$$\nHence $p_{\\text{same}}$ decreases as $n$ increases, and the probability that two beneficial mutations fall on different chromosomes is $1-\\frac{1}{n}$, which increases with $n$. Different chromosomes assort independently, so higher $n$ increases the fraction of beneficial-mutation pairs that are effectively unlinked and recombine freely, further reducing Hill-Robertson interference.\n\n4) Consequences for adaptation requiring multiple beneficial mutations at unlinked loci: Let the set of beneficial loci be $\\{i\\}$ with effects $s_{i}>0$. In the presence of interference, the effective selection experienced by each is reduced, $s_{i,\\text{eff}}<s_{i}$, and the joint fixation of multiple beneficial mutations is slowed. An increase in recombination rate, parameterized by the genome-wide rate $R$ or by $C$, increases $s_{i,\\text{eff}}$ toward $s_{i}$ and increases the rate at which genotypes carrying multiple beneficial mutations are assembled and amplified. Since $C_{A}>C_{B}$ and, under equal genome size, the fraction of pairs on the same chromosome scales as $1/n$, Species A experiences less interference and faster assembly of multi-locus adaptive genotypes.\n\nRejection of alternatives:\n- Option B is incorrect because tighter linkage does not generally accelerate multi-locus adaptation in sexual populations; it prevents recombination from combining beneficial mutations arising in different lineages and increases Hill-Robertson interference. The idea of “supergenes” applies to specific coadapted clusters, not to facilitating the assembly of independently arising beneficial mutations across the genome under a novel pathogen.\n- Option C is incorrect because the presumed benefits of fewer chromosomes for meiotic fidelity are not the rate-limiting step here, and both species are assumed to have identical life histories and genome sizes; moreover, reduced recombination would hinder, not help, the assembly of multiple beneficial mutations.\n- Option D is incorrect because, while mutation rate and population size strongly affect adaptation, recombination architecture also affects the rate of multi-locus adaptation via Hill-Robertson interference and the Fisher-Muller effect.\n- Option E is incorrect because chromosome number does not determine the duration of the cell cycle in organisms with multiple replication origins, and generation time is specified as identical; replication speed is not the relevant mechanism for differential adaptation here.\n\nTherefore, Species A, with the higher chromosome number, has a higher effective recombination rate, suffers less Hill-Robertson interference, and will adapt faster to the pathogen. The primary evolutionary mechanism is the reduction of linkage and interference due to higher recombination, enabling more efficient combination of beneficial mutations by natural selection.\n\nThus the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1937574"}, {"introduction": "The effects of Hill-Robertson interference are not merely theoretical; they leave detectable footprints in the DNA sequences of populations. This advanced practice challenges you to act as a population geneticist and interpret genomic data to uncover the evolutionary history of a region. By analyzing key summary statistics of the site frequency spectrum, you will learn to distinguish between two major modes of linked selection—background selection and recurrent selective sweeps—a fundamental skill for understanding the forces that shape genomic diversity [@problem_id:1937535].", "problem": "A population geneticist is studying the causes of variation in nucleotide diversity across the genome of a species of fruit fly. They identify two large, non-coding genomic regions, designated Region A and Region B, which both exhibit significantly lower nucleotide diversity compared to the genome-wide average. The researcher suspects that Hill-Robertson interference is responsible for the reduced diversity in both regions, but they wish to distinguish between two specific underlying causes: background selection (BGS), the purging of neutral variants linked to deleterious mutations, and recurrent selective sweeps (RSS), the periodic fixation of advantageous mutations that drag linked neutral variants with them.\n\nTo investigate, the researcher analyzes the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) for a large sample of individuals from the population. From the SFS of each region, they compute two standard summary statistics: Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H. Tajima's D compares the estimator of the population mutation rate based on the number of segregating sites with the estimator based on the average number of pairwise differences.

The statistic is\n$$\nD=\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}-\\hat{\\theta}_{W}}{\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\pi}-\\hat{\\theta}_{W})}}.\n$$\nNegative $D$ indicates an excess of low-frequency variants relative to the neutral equilibrium expectation (e.g., recent positive selection or purifying selection reducing effective population size), while positive $D$ indicates an excess of intermediate-frequency variants (e.g., balancing selection).\n- Fay and Wu's $H$ compares $\\hat{\\pi}$ with an estimator that weights high-frequency derived alleles, $\\hat{\\theta}_{H}$:\n$$\nH=\\hat{\\pi}-\\hat{\\theta}_{H}.\n$$\nStrongly negative $H$ indicates an excess of high-frequency derived alleles, a hallmark of hitchhiking due to recent or recurrent selective sweeps.\n\nWe next summarize expected qualitative signatures:\n- Background selection (BGS) primarily reduces effective population size locally, leading to reduced $\\hat{\\pi}$ and a modest skew toward rare variants. Thus $D$ tends to be slightly negative, and $H$ is typically near zero or only mildly negative, because BGS does not generate an excess of high-frequency derived alleles.\n- Recurrent selective sweeps (RSS) reduce $\\hat{\\pi}$ and produce a characteristic SFS with both an excess of rare variants and, crucially, an excess of high-frequency derived alleles. Therefore, $D$ becomes negative and $H$ becomes strongly negative (since $\\hat{\\theta}_{H}$ becomes large relative to $\\hat{\\pi}$).\n\nApply to the data:\n- Region A: $\\pi_{A}=0.003$ is reduced relative to $\\pi_{\\text{genome}}=0.012$; $D_{A}=-0.31$ is only mildly negative; $H_{A}=-0.85$ is modestly negative. This pattern is consistent with BGS: reduced diversity, slight excess of rare variants, but no pronounced excess of high-frequency derived alleles.\n- Region B: $\\pi_{B}=0.002$ is reduced; $D_{B}=-2.25$ is strongly negative; $H_{B}=-18.7$ is extremely negative. This is the classic signature of RSS: severe skew toward both rare variants and high-frequency derived alleles created by hitchhiking.\n\nRule out alternatives:\n- Both regions driven by RSS would predict strongly negative $H$ in both, which is not seen for Region A.\n- Both regions driven by BGS would not produce the extremely negative $H$ in Region B.\n- Balancing selection in Region A would increase diversity and typically yield $D>0$, contrary to the observed $\\pi_{A}$ reduction and $D_{A}<0$. A recent population bottleneck would be genome-wide rather than localized to Region B and would not uniquely produce $H$ as negative as observed.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible assignments are: Region A primarily BGS; Region B primarily RSS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1937535"}]}
