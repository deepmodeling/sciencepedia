Species A inhabits temperate waters, while Species B has recently, within the last few thousand years, colonized a consistently sub-zero Antarctic fjord. The primary adaptation enabling survival in this frigid environment is the evolution of a highly effective Antifreeze Protein (AFP). The biologist sequences the orthologous AFP gene from both species to analyze the evolutionary pressures it has undergone.\n\nThe analysis involves calculating the ratio of the rate of non-synonymous substitutions ($d_N$) to the rate of synonymous substitutions ($d_S$). A non-synonymous substitution is a nucleotide mutation that alters the amino acid sequence of a protein, while a synonymous substitution does not alter the amino acid sequence. The $d_N/d_S$ ratio is a classic measure used to detect selective pressures acting on a protein-coding gene.\n\nBased on this biological scenario, which of the following values is the most plausible $d_N/d_S$ ratio for the AFP gene when comparing Species A and Species B?\n\nA. 0.12\n\nB. 1.00\n\nC. 3.85\n\nD.

The ratio $d_N/d_S$ is interpreted as follows:\n- If $d_N/d_S  1$, purifying selection predominates, indicating selection against amino acid changes.\n- If $d_N/d_S \\approx 1$, evolution is approximately neutral with respect to amino acid changes.\n- If $d_N/d_S  1$, positive selection predominates, indicating adaptive amino acid changes have been favored.\n\nIn the described scenario, Species B has recently colonized a consistently sub-zero Antarctic fjord and survival depends on a highly effective AFP. This implies that functional changes in the AFP protein were advantageous and likely driven by positive selection during or after colonization. Therefore, when comparing the AFP gene between Species A (temperate) and Species B (Antarctic), an elevated $d_N/d_S$ ratio greater than $1$ is the most plausible indicator of positive selection acting on the protein-coding sequence.\n\nAmong the options:\n- A. $0.12$ implies strong purifying selection, inconsistent with recent adaptive change for a key survival trait.\n- B. $1.00$ implies neutrality, which is unlikely given the critical adaptive role of AFP in the new environment.\n- C. $3.85$ indicates strong positive selection, consistent with rapid adaptive evolution of AFP function in the Antarctic lineage.\n- D.

They decide to compare the gene sequence for beta-actin between a human (*Homo sapiens*) and a coelacanth (*Latimeria chalumnae*), two lineages that diverged approximately 420 million years ago.\n\nUsing a 300-codon segment of the beta-actin gene, the student's sequence analysis software provides the following statistics based on the alignment:\n-   Total number of non-synonymous sites ($N$): 690\n-   Total number of synonymous sites ($S$): 210\n-   Number of observed non-synonymous differences ($N_d$): 15\n-   Number of observed synonymous differences ($S_d$): 165\n\nThe student attempts to calculate the rate of synonymous substitutions ($d_S$), which is a measure of the number of substitutions that have occurred per synonymous site, using the simple Jukes-Cantor correction model.

The beta-actin gene must have experienced strong positive selection in either the human or coelacanth lineage, which invalidates the Jukes-Cantor model.\n\nB. The alignment must be incorrect, because the observed number of differences ($S_d$) is too high to be biologically realistic for a conserved gene.\n\nC. The evolutionary divergence time is so great that synonymous sites have become saturated with substitutions, meaning the Jukes-Cantor model cannot be used because its mathematical assumptions have been violated.\n\nD. The Jukes-Cantor model is designed for neutrally evolving sequences, and cannot be applied to a gene like beta-actin which is known to be under strong functional constraint.\n\nE. The high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous sites in this gene segment makes any estimation of substitution rates inherently unstable and prone to error.", "solution": "We first compute the observed proportion of synonymous differences.

Therefore, the correct explanation is that extensive divergence has led to saturation at synonymous sites, not issues of selection on nonsynonymous changes, alignment error, or site-class ratios.\n\nHence, the most accurate statement is that the divergence is so great that synonymous sites are saturated, making the Jukes-Cantor model invalid for this comparison.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1919908"}, {"introduction": "The interpretation of a $d_N/d_S$ ratio is not always straightforward and is deeply intertwined with a population's demographic history. This advanced problem challenges the simple dichotomy of selection versus neutrality by exploring how a high $d_N/d_S$ ratio can emerge without any positive selection. By considering the role of population size, you will engage with the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, which explains how the reduced efficacy of purifying selection in small populations can mimic the signature of neutral evolution.[@problem_id:1919890]", "problem": "A large, stable mainland population of a species of beetle, `Coleoptera major`, has been studied for decades. Within this population, a gene known as `Detox-7`, which codes for an enzyme that neutralizes common plant-based toxins, is known to be under strong functional constraint. A long-term evolutionary analysis comparing `Detox-7` to its ortholog in a sister species yields a ratio of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site ($d_N$) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site ($d_S$) of approximately 0.12.\n\nRecently, a small, isolated population of these beetles was discovered on a remote island, having been founded by a small number of individuals from the mainland approximately 5,000 generations ago. The island environment contains the same plants and thus the same toxins as the mainland. When geneticists sequence the `Detox-7` gene from the island population and compare it to the mainland population's sequence, they calculate a $d_N/d_S$ ratio of 0.91 for the evolutionary branch leading to the island population since its divergence.\n\nAssuming there is no positive selection acting on the `Detox-7` gene in the island population, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental population genetic explanation for the observed increase in the $d_N/d_S$ ratio toward unity?\n\nA. The colonization of the island created novel ecological pressures that made previously deleterious mutations in the `Detox-7` gene beneficial, accelerating their fixation.\n\nB. The small effective population size on the island reduces the efficacy of purifying selection, allowing many slightly deleterious non-synonymous mutations to drift to fixation at a rate approaching the neutral substitution rate.\n\nC. The environmental stress associated with the founding of a new population induced a higher rate of non-synonymous mutations relative to synonymous mutations in the `Detox-7` gene.\n\nD. The `Detox-7` gene has lost its function and become a pseudogene in the island population, causing all new mutations to be neutral and fix at the same rate.\n\nE. The rate of synonymous substitution ($d_S$) has been significantly suppressed in the island lineage due to strong selection on codon usage, artificially inflating the $d_N/d_S$ ratio.", "solution": "Let $\\omega$ denote the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates, $\\omega = d_N/d_S$. Fundamental interpretations are:\n- $\\omega = 1$ under neutrality, because both non-synonymous and synonymous changes fix at the neutral rate.\n- $\\omega  1$ under purifying selection, because deleterious non-synonymous mutations have reduced fixation probabilities.\n- $\\omega  1$ under positive selection, because advantageous non-synonymous mutations fix more often.\n\nThe mainland lineage shows $\\omega \\approx 0.12$, indicating strong purifying selection on the encoded protein. The island lineage shows $\\omega \\approx 0.91$, approaching unity. The problem states that there is no positive selection and the environment is unchanged, so an increase in $\\omega$ toward $1$ must arise from changes in the efficacy of selection rather than a shift in adaptive pressures.\n\nUnder classical population genetics (Kimura’s diffusion results), the fixation probability of a new mutation with selection coefficient $s$ in a population of effective size $N_e$ is approximately\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}}(s) \\approx \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2s)}{1 - \\exp(-4N_{e}s)}.\n$$\nFor the nearly neutral regime, where $|N_e s| \\ll 1$, this reduces to\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}}(s) \\approx \\frac{1}{2N_{e}},\n$$\nwhich is identical to the neutral fixation probability. Thus, when $N_e$ is small, a larger fraction of slightly deleterious non-synonymous mutations (with $s0$ but $|N_e s| \\lesssim 1$) behave effectively neutrally.\n\nLet $\\mu_S$ be the synonymous mutation rate and $\\mu_N$ the total non-synonymous mutation rate.
