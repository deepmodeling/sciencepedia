By comparing a functional gene region (an exon) under strong purifying selection with an adjacent neutral region (an intron), you will build an intuition for how different evolutionary pressures shape genetic variation. This practice helps clarify why purifying selection, by removing deleterious mutations, leaves behind an excess of rare alleles and results in a characteristically negative Tajima's D value [@problem_id:1968041].", "problem": "In population genetics, Tajima's D is a statistical test used to analyze patterns of genetic variation in a sample of DNA sequences from a population. The statistic summarizes the allele frequency spectrum. A value of Tajima's D close to zero is expected under a standard neutral model of evolution in a population of constant size. A negative value indicates an excess of rare alleles compared to the neutral expectation, while a positive value indicates a deficit of rare alleles (or an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles).\n\nAn evolutionary biologist is studying a specific gene in a large, demographically stable population of diploid organisms. This gene contains a functional protein-coding region (an exon) and an adjacent non-functional region that is removed during messenger RNA processing (an intron). The biologist sequences both the exon and the intron from many individuals in the population. It is well-established that the exon is under strong purifying (negative) selection because it codes for a critical enzymatic active site, meaning most mutations within it are deleterious. The intron, being non-functional, is assumed to be evolving neutrally.\n\nLet $D_{exon}$ represent the Tajima's D value calculated for the exon sequence data, and let $D_{intron}$ represent the Tajima's D value calculated for the intron sequence data.
