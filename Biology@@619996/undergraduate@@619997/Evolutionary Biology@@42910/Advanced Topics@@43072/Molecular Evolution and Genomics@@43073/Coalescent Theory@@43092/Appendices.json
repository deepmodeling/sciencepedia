Deviations from this expectation can reveal the action of other evolutionary forces.

They analyze the gene genealogies for two genetic loci, Locus A and Locus B, which are located on different chromosomes and are therefore genetically unlinked.\n\nFrom a large sample of gene copies collected from the population, the biologist reconstructs the coalescent history for each locus. The average time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) for Locus A is found to be substantially longer than the average time to the MRCA for Locus B.

For two unlinked loci in a constant-size population, neutrality predicts comparable coalescent time distributions, up to stochastic variation. The observation states that Locus B is neutral and consistent with demography, while Locus A has a substantially longer average $T_{\\mathrm{MRCA}}$ than neutral expectation.\n\nWe evaluate each hypothesis:\n\nA. Higher mutation rate at Locus A. Under the infinite-sites or Jukes–Cantor models, the mutation rate $\\mu$ affects the number of observed differences but does not change the genealogy itself. In particular, the expected number of segregating sites is $\\mathbb{E}[S]=\\theta H_{n-1}$ with $\\theta=4N_{e}\\mu$ and $H_{n-1}$ the harmonic number, whereas the coalescent time distribution depends on $N_{e}$ and demography, not on $\\mu$.

A recent severe population bottleneck. A bottleneck reduces $N_{e}$ over some interval, which increases coalescence rates during that interval, leading to shorter genealogies genome-wide. If the entire population had experienced a recent severe bottleneck, then all unlinked loci, including Locus B, would show reduced $T_{\\mathrm{MRCA}}$ relative to constant-size neutrality. Since Locus B is consistent with constant-size neutrality, C is inconsistent with the observations.\n\nD. Strong purifying selection at Locus A. Background selection reduces the local effective population size to $N_{e}^{\\prime}=B N_{e}$ with $0<B<1$, so the neutral coalescent time scales down:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[T_{\\mathrm{MRCA}}^{(\\mathrm{pur})}\\right]\\approx 4N_{e}^{\\prime}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right)=4B N_{e}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right)<4N_{e}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right).\n$$\nThus purifying selection shortens $T_{\\mathrm{MRCA}}$, not lengthens it. D is inconsistent with the longer $T_{\\mathrm{MRCA}}$.\n\nE. A recent selective sweep at Locus A. A sweep due to strong positive selection forces rapid coalescence of lineages to the sweeping haplotype, drastically reducing $T_{\\mathrm{MRCA}}$ at the targeted locus. Hence,\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{MRCA}}^{(\\mathrm{sweep})}\\ll 4N_{e}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right),\n$$\nthe opposite of what is observed. E is inconsistent.\n\nB. Balancing selection at Locus A. Long-term balancing selection maintaining multiple alleles creates a structured-coalescent scenario in which lineages are partitioned by allelic class. If two alleles are maintained at frequencies $p$ and $1-p$ for a long time $T_{\\mathrm{bal}}$, then:\n- Lineages in different allelic classes cannot coalesce until they trace back to the origin of the balanced polymorphism, so the MRCA must predate $T_{\\mathrm{bal}}$.\n- Within-class coalescence occurs on a timescale proportional to the class-specific effective sizes $pN_{e}$ and $(1-p)N_{e}$, yielding expected within-class coalescent times on the order of $2pN_{e}$ or $2(1-p)N_{e}$ for pairs.\nConsequently, the overall expected height of the genealogy at Locus A satisfies\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[T_{\\mathrm{MRCA}}^{(\\mathrm{bal})}\\right]\\gtrsim T_{\\mathrm{bal}}+\\text{(within-class coalescence time)},\n$$\nwhich can substantially exceed the neutral expectation $4N_{e}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$ when $T_{\\mathrm{bal}}$ is large. Therefore, balancing selection uniquely explains a substantially longer $T_{\\mathrm{MRCA}}$ at Locus A while leaving unlinked neutral loci like Locus B consistent with demographic neutrality.\n\nGiven the options, only B predicts a systematically longer time to MRCA at a single locus relative to neutral expectations in a constant-size population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1914437"}]}
