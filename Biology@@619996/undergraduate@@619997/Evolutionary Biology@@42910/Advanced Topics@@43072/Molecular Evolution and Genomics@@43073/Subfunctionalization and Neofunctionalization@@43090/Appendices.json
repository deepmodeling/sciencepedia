{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the fate of duplicated genes begins with recognizing the tell-tale patterns of their evolution. This exercise presents a classic conceptual scenario involving antibiotic resistance in bacteria. By analyzing the functional evolution of a duplicated gene in a new environment, you will practice applying the core definition of neofunctionalization, where one gene copy evolves a completely new, beneficial function while the other preserves the original role [@problem_id:1966587].", "problem": "A population of bacteria possesses a gene, `resX`, which codes for an enzyme that provides resistance to an antibiotic called Tetricycline-A by actively pumping it out of the cell. The function of this enzyme is singular and highly specific to Tetricycline-A. A gene duplication event occurs in one bacterium, which then founds a new lineage. In this lineage, the original gene, `resX`, and the new copy, `resX'`, are both present. This bacterial population lives in an environment that contains both Tetricycline-A and a new, structurally different antibiotic, Chlorophen-B.\n\nAfter many generations of evolution in this dual-antibiotic environment, a genetic analysis of the population reveals the following:\n1. The original gene, `resX`, is preserved and continues to confer effective resistance to Tetricycline-A.\n2. The duplicated gene, `resX'`, has accumulated a series of mutations. These mutations have altered its protein product's substrate specificity, making it an effective efflux pump for Chlorophen-B. However, it has completely lost its ability to pump Tetricycline-A.\n\nWhich of the following evolutionary models best describes the fate of the duplicated gene, `resX'`, in this scenario?\n\nA. Subfunctionalization\nB. Nonfunctionalization\nC. Neofunctionalization\nD. Gene Conservation\nE. Concerted Evolution", "solution": "We begin with a gene duplication event producing two paralogs: the original gene `resX` and the copy `resX'`. The ancestral function of `resX` is a single, specific activity: active efflux of Tetricycline-A. After evolution in an environment containing both Tetricycline-A and Chlorophen-B, the observations are:\n- `resX` retains the ancestral function (efflux of Tetricycline-A).\n- `resX'` accumulates mutations that change substrate specificity so that it effectively pumps Chlorophen-B, while losing the ancestral ability to pump Tetricycline-A.\n\nWe evaluate the standard models of duplicated gene fate:\n- Subfunctionalization requires that the ancestral gene had multiple subfunctions partitioned between duplicates, such that both copies are needed to recapitulate the full ancestral set. Here, the ancestral function was singular, and the full ancestral function is retained entirely by `resX` alone. Moreover, `resX'` does not retain a subset of the ancestral function but rather loses it and gains a novel function; therefore, this is not subfunctionalization.\n- Nonfunctionalization is degeneration of the duplicate into a nonfunctional pseudogene. This is inconsistent because `resX'` has acquired a functional role (efflux of Chlorophen-B).\n- Neofunctionalization is the retention of the ancestral function in one copy and the acquisition of a novel adaptive function in the other, typically facilitated by relaxed constraint on the duplicate followed by positive selection for the new activity. This exactly matches the scenario: `resX` preserves the ancestral function, and `resX'` evolves a new, effective function specific to Chlorophen-B while losing the ancestral specificity.\n- Gene conservation implies both copies retain the same original function; this is contradicted by the divergence in substrate specificity.\n- Concerted evolution entails homogenization of duplicates via mechanisms such as gene conversion, leading to similar sequences and functions; this is incompatible with the observed functional divergence.\n\nTherefore, the evolutionary model best describing the fate of `resX'` is neofunctionalization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1966587"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple functional descriptions, we can infer gene fate by examining changes at the molecular level. A gene's \"function\" is often defined by its network of interactions with other molecules. This problem challenges you to interpret hypothetical protein-protein interaction (PPI) data for a pair of duplicated genes and their ancestral counterpart, providing a clear example of how subfunctionalization results in a \"division of labor,\" where each paralog retains a distinct subset of the ancestral interactions [@problem_id:1923700].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the fate of a duplicated gene in a model vertebrate species, *Species A*. The gene duplication event produced two paralogous kinases, Kinase-A1 and Kinase-A2, which are involved in a critical cell signaling pathway. To infer the evolutionary mechanism that drove the divergence of these paralogs, the researcher characterized their complete set of direct Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) partners. For comparison, the researcher also identified the single, direct ortholog of the ancestral gene, named Kinase-O, in a closely related outgroup, *Species O*, and characterized its PPI partners. The ancestral state of the interaction network is assumed to be represented by the interactions of Kinase-O.\n\nThe experimentally determined sets of interacting protein partners are as follows:\n- The set of interactors for the ancestral-like kinase, Kinase-O, is `{P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9}`.\n- The set of interactors for the paralog Kinase-A1 is `{P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}`.\n- The set of interactors for the paralog Kinase-A2 is `{P6, P7, P8, P9}`.\n\nAll listed proteins (P1 through P9) are orthologous across both species. Based on this data, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and parsimonious conclusion about the evolutionary fate of the duplicated kinases?\n\nA. The paralogs have undergone neofunctionalization, with Kinase-A1 evolving a new function and Kinase-A2 retaining the ancestral functions.\nB. The paralogs have undergone subfunctionalization, partitioning the ancestral functions between them.\nC. The paralogs have undergone neofunctionalization, where both Kinase-A1 and Kinase-A2 have evolved novel, distinct functions not present in the ancestor.\nD. The paralogs have undergone nonfunctionalization, and the observed interactions are spurious or represent residual ancestral binding affinity with no functional significance.\nE. The paralogs have undergone neofunctionalization, with Kinase-A2 evolving a new function and Kinase-A1 retaining the ancestral functions.", "solution": "Let the ancestral interaction set be $S_{O}=\\{P1,P2,P3,P4,P5,P6,P7,P8,P9\\}$, and the interaction sets for the two paralogs be $S_{A1}=\\{P1,P2,P3,P4,P5\\}$ and $S_{A2}=\\{P6,P7,P8,P9\\}$. By direct comparison, compute the union and intersection:\n$$S_{A1}\\cup S_{A2}=\\{P1,P2,P3,P4,P5,P6,P7,P8,P9\\}=S_{O},$$\n$$S_{A1}\\cap S_{A2}=\\varnothing.$$\nThus, the paralogs together recapitulate the full ancestral interaction repertoire, and each paralog retains a complementary, non-overlapping subset of the ancestral interactions.\n\nInterpretation under standard evolutionary models:\n- Subfunctionalization predicts partitioning of ancestral functions (here, PPIs) between duplicates such that the union matches the ancestral set and neither paralog alone retains all ancestral functions. The observed $S_{A1}\\cup S_{A2}=S_{O}$ with $S_{A1}\\neq S_{O}$ and $S_{A2}\\neq S_{O}$, and $S_{A1}\\cap S_{A2}=\\varnothing$, matches this prediction.\n- Neofunctionalization requires gain of novel functions; operationally here this would appear as interactors present in $S_{A1}$ or $S_{A2}$ that are not in $S_{O}$. Since all observed interactors are a subset of $S_{O}$, there is no evidence for novel interactions in either paralog; hence options asserting neofunctionalization (A, C, E) are not supported.\n- Nonfunctionalization would involve loss of functional interactions to the point of inactivity in one duplicate, or interactions being spurious. The precise, complementary partition of $S_{O}$ argues against this and indicates maintained functional specificity, so D is not supported.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and parsimonious conclusion is subfunctionalization, consistent with the duplication-degeneration-complementation model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1923700"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary biologists often turn to DNA sequence data to find quantitative evidence of selection.

The *D. pseudoobscura* lineage retains the single-copy ancestral gene, KRA-P.\n\nTo understand the evolutionary fate of the duplicated genes, the coding sequences of KRA-A1, KRA-A2, and KRA-P are aligned. The analysis focuses on comparing the orthologous pair (e.g., KRA-A1 vs. KRA-P) and the paralogous pair (KRA-A1 vs. KRA-A2).
