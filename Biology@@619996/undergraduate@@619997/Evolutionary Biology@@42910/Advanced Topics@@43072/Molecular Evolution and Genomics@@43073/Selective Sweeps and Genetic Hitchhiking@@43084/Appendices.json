The spread of this advantageous allele through the population due to positive selection is known as a selective sweep. The change in the frequency, $p$, of this beneficial allele over time in generations, $t$, can be modeled by the logistic differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dt} = sp(1-p) $$\nwhere $s$ is the selection coefficient, a measure of the fitness advantage of the allele.\n\nConsider a bacterial population where a mutation confers resistance to a newly introduced antibiotic. This resistance allele has a selection coefficient of $s = 0.045$. Calculate the number of generations it takes for the frequency of this resistance allele to increase from an initial frequency of $p_0 = 0.005$ to a frequency of $p_f = 0.995$.\n\nExpress your answer for the number of generations as a real number, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the time $T$ it takes for an allele frequency $p$ to change from an initial value $p_0$ to a final value $p_f$, governed by the differential equation $\\frac{dp}{dt} = sp(1-p)$.\n\nFirst, we must solve this differential equation to find an expression for the time $T$. We can do this by separating the variables $p$ and $t$.\n$$ \\frac{dp}{p(1-p)} = s \\, dt $$\nTo find the total time $T$ required for the frequency to change from $p_0$ to $p_f$, we integrate both sides of the equation over the corresponding intervals.

This exercise explores the fundamental reason why we find 'valleys' of low genetic diversity in genomes, a concept known as genetic hitchhiking. Answering this question will solidify your understanding of why identifying the precise target of selection is a major challenge for evolutionary biologists. [@problem_id:1962102]", "problem": "Population geneticists are studying a species of bacterium that has recently evolved resistance to a new antibiotic. By comparing the genomes of resistant bacteria to their susceptible ancestors, they identify a specific chromosomal region, approximately 50,000 base pairs long, that shows an extreme reduction in genetic diversity in the resistant population. This pattern, where diversity is eliminated at and around a selected locus, is the classic signature of a \"selective sweep.\" Within this region, researchers pinpointed the gene conferring resistance, which we will call `ResA`. However, they also found 12 other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this same low-diversity region that are consistently present in all resistant strains but absent in the susceptible ones. These SNPs are located in non-coding regions or cause synonymous changes in other nearby genes. The researchers are now faced with the challenge of determining which of these 13 mutations (the one in `ResA` or the 12 other SNPs) was the actual target of positive selection.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best scientific explanation for why it is inherently difficult to distinguish the causative beneficial mutation from the other co-occurring mutations within a region that has undergone a selective sweep?\n\nA. The process of selection temporarily increases the local mutation rate around the beneficial allele, creating a cluster of new mutations that are all selected for simultaneously.\n\nB. High rates of genetic recombination within the swept region constantly shuffle alleles, making it impossible to reconstruct the original haplotype that carried the beneficial mutation.\n\nC. A selective sweep is observationally indistinguishable from a population bottleneck, which reduces genetic diversity across the entire genome, thus obscuring the specific target of selection.\n\nD. Neutral or nearly neutral mutations that are in close physical proximity to the beneficial mutation are carried to high frequency along with it, a process known as genetic hitchhiking.", "solution": "We seek the mechanistic reason why multiple mutations within a low-diversity region created by a selective sweep all appear fixed in the resistant population, making it difficult to identify which one was the true target of positive selection.\n\nUnder a hard selective sweep, a beneficial allele with selection coefficient $s$ rises from low initial frequency to near fixation over a characteristic time scale $T_{\\text{sweep}}$. In a simple deterministic approximation with directional selection, the allele frequency $p(t)$ follows $dp/dt = s p (1 - p)$, and the duration to traverse most of the frequency range is approximately\n$$\nT_{\\text{sweep}} \\approx \\frac{1}{s} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{f}(1 - p_{0})}{p_{0}(1 - p_{f})}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $p_{0}$ and $p_{f}$ denote the initial and final frequencies of the beneficial allele, respectively. During this sweep, nearby loci in physical proximity experience reduced effective recombination relative to the rapid change in frequency at the selected site.\n\nConsider a neutral or nearly neutral SNP at recombination rate $r$ (per generation) from the selected site. The probability that recombination breaks its association with the selected background at least once during the sweep is approximately $1 - \\exp(-r T_{\\text{sweep}})$. Consequently, the probability that the neutral SNP remains linked to the sweeping haplotype throughout the sweep is\n$$\nP_{\\text{hitchhike}} \\approx \\exp(-r T_{\\text{sweep}}).\n$$\nFor loci sufficiently close to the selected site, $r T_{\\text{sweep}} \\ll 1$, implying $P_{\\text{hitchhike}}$ is close to $1$. Therefore, neutral or synonymous variants initially present on the haplotype carrying the beneficial allele are carried to high frequency (often fixation) simply because they are physically linked and recombination does not have sufficient time to separate them during the sweep. This phenomenon is genetic hitchhiking and it generates a cluster of fixed or high-frequency variants within a window whose size is determined by the interplay between $s$ and $r$ (and demographic parameters). The resulting reduction in diversity and extended linkage disequilibrium make co-occurring mutations within the swept region observationally similar in frequency and haplotype context, thereby making it inherently difficult to distinguish the causative mutation from its passengers using presence/absence patterns alone.\n\nEvaluating the options in light of this mechanism:\n- Option A is incorrect because selection does not increase the local mutation rate; selection changes allele frequencies, not the mutation process.\n- Option B is incorrect because a hallmark of a strong sweep is reduced effective recombination within the swept region during the sweep, not constant shuffling; high recombination would erode the signature rather than create it.\n- Option C is incorrect because a selective sweep is localized to a genomic region linked to the beneficial allele, whereas a population bottleneck reduces diversity genome-wide; with genome-wide data, these are distinguishable.\n- Option D is correct because it precisely describes genetic hitchhiking: neutral or nearly neutral mutations in close physical linkage with the beneficial mutation are carried to high frequency during the sweep, making them difficult to distinguish from the true target of selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1962102"}, {"introduction": "The dramatic signature of a selective sweep is not permanent, and its gradual decay provides a forensic tool for evolutionary biologists.

Over subsequent generations, recombination events break down this haplotype, and the region of high LD shrinks.\n\nPopulation geneticists have analyzed the genomes in this population and found that a signature of the selective sweep remains.
