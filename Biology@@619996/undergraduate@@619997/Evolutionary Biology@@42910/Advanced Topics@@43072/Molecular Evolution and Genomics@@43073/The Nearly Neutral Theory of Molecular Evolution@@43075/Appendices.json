While the strict neutral theory posits that the substitution rate of neutral mutations is independent of population size, the nearly neutral theory offers a more nuanced view, especially for mutations with small fitness effects. This exercise puts you at the center of a classic debate, asking you to use quantitative reasoning to determine whether the substitution rate of slightly deleterious mutations depends on the effective population size, $N_e$. By working through this problem, you will directly test a core prediction that distinguishes these two major theories of molecular evolution. [@problem_id:1972266]", "problem": "In an evolutionary biology discussion, two students, Anja and Ben, are debating the relationship between the rate of molecular evolution and population size. Anja, recalling the strict neutral theory, argues that the substitution rate of mutations is independent of the effective population size. Ben, however, brings up the nearly neutral theory, arguing that for a specific class of mutations—slightly deleterious ones—the substitution rate should be negatively correlated with the effective population size.\n\nTo resolve their debate, you are asked to model the situation for two hypothetical species of diploid organisms.\n- Species 1 has a small effective population size of $N_1 = 500$.\n- Species 2 has a large effective population size of $N_2 = 5000$.\n\nBoth species experience the same type of slightly deleterious mutations at a specific gene locus. The mutation rate per gene per generation, $\\mu$, is identical for both species. These mutations confer a selection coefficient of $s = -1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ against heterozygotes.\n\nAccording to population genetics theory, the rate of substitution ($k$) at a locus is given by the product of the total number of new mutations entering the population per generation and their probability of fixation ($P_{fix}$). For a diploid population of size $N$, this is:\n$$k = 2N\\mu P_{fix}$$\nThe probability of fixation for a new mutation with a selection coefficient $s$ is given by Kimura's formula:\n$$P_{fix} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2s)}{1 - \\exp(-4Ns)}$$\n\nUsing this framework, evaluate the students' claims by calculating the ratio of the substitution rate in the large population ($k_2$) to that in the small population ($k_1$).

After all, intuition might suggest that evolution is primarily driven by beneficial mutations. This practice challenges you to think about the total evolutionary process, from the origin of a mutation to its potential fixation across a population. It reveals that the evolutionary significance of a class of mutations depends not just on their fixation probability, $P_{fix}$, but also crucially on their mutation rate, $\\mu$, providing the fundamental reason for the theory's focus. [@problem_id:1972271]", "problem": "In population genetics, the fate of a new mutation is determined by the interplay between natural selection and genetic drift. The strength of selection on a mutation is quantified by the selection coefficient, $s$, where $s > 0$ for beneficial mutations, $s < 0$ for deleterious mutations, and $s = 0$ for neutral mutations. The strength of genetic drift is inversely proportional to the effective population size, $N_e$. A mutation is considered \"effectively neutral\" if the force of selection acting on it is weaker than the force of drift, a condition often approximated by the inequality $|2 N_e s| \\le 1$.\n\nA major theory of molecular evolution, the nearly neutral theory, proposes that a significant fraction of substitutions at the molecular level are due to the fixation of these \"effectively neutral\" mutations by genetic drift. This framework is particularly powerful in explaining why the rate of molecular evolution can be relatively constant over long evolutionary timescales across species with vastly different population sizes.\n\nAlthough the fixation of slightly beneficial mutations ($s>0$, where $2N_e s \\approx 1$) is also influenced by this interplay, the theory places a primary emphasis on the dynamics of slightly deleterious mutations ($s<0$, where $|2 N_e s| \\approx 1$). Which of the following statements provides the most fundamental evolutionary reason for this specific focus on slightly deleterious mutations?\n\nA. Slightly deleterious mutations can reach fixation faster than slightly beneficial mutations due to stronger genetic drift effects on negative selection.\n\nB. Beneficial mutations are, by definition, always driven to fixation by selection, regardless of population size, so their dynamics are not governed by the $|2 N_e s| \\le 1$ condition.\n\nC. The total rate of substitution is a product of the mutation rate and the fixation probability, and the mutation process itself is far more likely to produce deleterious or neutral alleles than beneficial ones.\n\nD. In large populations, selection against deleterious mutations is highly efficient, so they never contribute to substitution, making their inclusion in a general theory unnecessary.\n\nE. The mathematical models for the fixation probability of deleterious mutations are more tractable and provide a better fit to empirical data than the models for beneficial mutations.", "solution": "We consider the standard diffusion approximation for the fixation probability of a new mutation with selection coefficient $s$ in a Wright–Fisher population with effective size $N_{e}$. For a new mutation arising at initial frequency $x_{0} = \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}$ under genic selection, the fixation probability is\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}}(s) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2s)}{1 - \\exp(-4N_{e} s)}.\n$$\nIn the nearly neutral regime where $|2N_{e} s| \\le 1$ and in particular $|2N_{e} s| \\ll 1$, a Taylor expansion yields\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}}(s) \\approx \\frac{1}{2N_{e}} \\left(1 + 2N_{e} s + O((N_{e} s)^{2})\\right).\n$$\nThus, for slightly beneficial mutations ($s>0$), $P_{\\text{fix}}(s)$ is slightly larger than the neutral value $\\frac{1}{2N_{e}}$, and for slightly deleterious mutations ($s<0$), it is slightly smaller. To first order, however, both are of order $\\frac{1}{2N_{e}}$ in the nearly neutral window.\n\nThe rate of substitution from a class of mutations with selection coefficient $s$ is the product of their per-generation mutation input and their fixation probability:\n$$\nK(s) = \\mu(s) \\, P_{\\text{fix}}(s),\n$$\nwhere $\\mu(s)$ denotes the per-generation rate at which mutations with effect $s$ arise. Decomposing into beneficial and deleterious classes with representative $s_{b}>0$ and $s_{d}<0$ in the nearly neutral regime, we have\n$$\nK_{b} \\approx \\mu_{b} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2N_{e}} \\left(1 + 2N_{e} s_{b}\\right), \\qquad\nK_{d} \\approx \\mu_{d} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2N_{e}} \\left(1 + 2N_{e} s_{d}\\right).\n$$\nBecause $s_{d}<0$, $K_{d}$ is reduced relative to the neutral benchmark per mutation, while $K_{b}$ is increased. However, the mutation process generates far more deleterious (and neutral) variants than beneficial ones, which implies $\\mu_{d} \\gg \\mu_{b}$. Therefore, even if $P_{\\text{fix}}(s_{d}) < P_{\\text{fix}}(s_{b})$, the total contribution of slightly deleterious mutations to substitutions can dominate due to their much larger mutation input:\n$$\n\\frac{K_{d}}{K_{b}} \\approx \\frac{\\mu_{d}}{\\mu_{b}} \\cdot \\frac{1 + 2N_{e} s_{d}}{1 + 2N_{e} s_{b}},\n$$\nand for typical distributions of fitness effects where $\\mu_{d}/\\mu_{b}$ is large, this ratio exceeds one. This supply-side argument is the fundamental evolutionary reason the nearly neutral theory emphasizes slightly deleterious mutations: the substitution rate is the product of mutation supply and fixation probability, and the overwhelming majority of new mutations are deleterious or effectively neutral rather than beneficial.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because slightly deleterious mutations do not fix faster; conditional on fixation, deleterious alleles typically take longer, and their fixation probability is lower than that of beneficial alleles with the same $|s|$.\n- B is incorrect because beneficial mutations are not always driven to fixation regardless of $N_{e}$; when $|2N_{e} s| \\lesssim 1$, drift substantially affects their fate.\n- C is correct because it directly invokes the fundamental decomposition $K=\\mu \\cdot P_{\\text{fix}}$ and the empirical fact that the mutation process predominantly produces deleterious or neutral alleles.\n- D is incorrect because it asserts “never” and ignores that the nearly neutral regime specifically concerns parameter ranges where deleterious mutations can contribute, especially in smaller populations.\n- E is a methodological claim, not the fundamental evolutionary reason, and is not generally accurate.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental evolutionary reason for the focus on slightly deleterious mutations is captured by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1972271"}, {"introduction": "In nature, the fitness effects of mutations are rarely simple.
