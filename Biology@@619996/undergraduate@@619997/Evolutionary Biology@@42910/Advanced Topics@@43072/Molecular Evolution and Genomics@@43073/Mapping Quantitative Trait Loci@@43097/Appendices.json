This exercise simulates the crucial step of interpreting this output.

They created an F2 intercross population by mating domestic chickens (selected for large body size) with their wild ancestors, the Red Junglefowl. After measuring the body weight of hundreds of F2 individuals and genotyping them at various genetic markers, they performed a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis. A QTL is a region of the genome associated with variation in a particular quantitative trait.\n\nThe strength of the association between a genomic region and the trait is measured by a Logarithm of Odds (LOD) score. A high LOD score at a specific chromosomal location suggests that a QTL is likely located there. The researchers have established a significance threshold for their study: a local peak in the LOD score of 3.0 or greater is considered significant evidence for the presence of a QTL.\n\nBelow are the LOD scores calculated at several positions along chromosome 4. The positions are given in centiMorgans (cM), a unit of genetic map distance.\n\n- Position 10 cM: LOD Score = 0.9\n- Position 35 cM: LOD Score = 2.4\n- Position 50 cM: LOD Score = 4.2\n- Position 65 cM: LOD Score = 3.1\n- Position 80 cM: LOD Score = 1.5\n- Position 105 cM: LOD Score = 1.9\n- Position 120 cM: LOD Score = 5.6\n- Position 135 cM: LOD Score = 4.0\n- Position 150 cM: LOD Score = 2.1\n- Position 165 cM: LOD Score = 1.2\n- Position 180 cM: LOD Score = 2.8\n\nBased on this data and the significance threshold, how many significant QTLs affecting body weight are located on chromosome 4, and what are their most likely positions?\n\nA.

Although $3.1 \\ge 3.0$, it is not a local maximum because $L(50)>L(65)$; thus $x=65$ is not counted as a separate QTL.\n- At $x=120$, $L(120)=5.6$, with flanks $L(105)=1.9$ and $L(135)=4.0$. Since $5.6 \\ge 3.0$, $5.6 \\ge 1.9$, and $5.6 \\ge 4.0$, $x=120$ is a significant local peak.\n- At $x=135$, $L(135)=4.0$, with flanks $L(120)=5.6$ and $L(150)=2.1$. It is not a local maximum because $L(120)>L(135)$; thus not a separate QTL.\n- All other positions have $L(x)<T$ (e.g., $x=180$ has $L(180)=2.8<T$) and are not significant.\n\nTherefore, there are two significant QTLs corresponding to the two distinct local peaks, at $50$ cM and $120$ cM.

This practice challenges you to determine the mode of gene action—such as complete dominance or an additive effect—by examining the average trait values for different marker genotypes. This skill is essential for understanding how specific alleles contribute to trait variation and for making predictions in selective breeding programs [@problem_id:1501718].", "problem": "A plant geneticist is conducting a study to identify genes influencing fruit size in a novel variety of cherry tomato. Using a large population derived from a cross, they perform a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis, which is a statistical method used to link phenotypic data (quantitative traits) to genotypic data (molecular markers) in an effort to map the regions of the genome containing genes for the trait.\n\nThe analysis reveals a strong association between fruit weight and a specific molecular marker, M1, which has two alleles, denoted as 'A' and 'a'. After genotyping and weighing hundreds of individual plants, the geneticist calculates the average fruit weight for each of the three possible marker genotypes:\n\n-   Plants with genotype 'AA' have an average fruit weight of 150 grams.\n-   Plants with genotype 'Aa' have an average fruit weight of 150 grams.\n-   Plants with genotype 'aa' have an average fruit weight of 100 grams.\n\nAssuming that this marker is very tightly linked to the actual causative gene for this difference in fruit weight, what term best describes the genetic effect of the 'A' allele relative to the 'a' allele on this trait?\n\nA.

This problem explores the phenomenon of transgressive segregation, where offspring can display phenotypes more extreme than those of either parent. By calculating the maximum possible trait value in an F2 population, you will gain insight into how new combinations of additive alleles from multiple loci can unlock hidden genetic variation [@problem_id:1501646].", "problem": "A plant geneticist is investigating the genetic basis of height in a species of ornamental grass, *Festuca spectabilis*. From their work, they established that a plant's total height is determined by a baseline height of 50 cm, plus the combined effects of alleles at four unlinked Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs), which we will denote as QTL1, QTL2, QTL3, and QTL4.\n\nFor each QTL, there are two possible alleles: a 'high' allele (H), which adds 10 cm to the plant's height, and a 'low' allele (h), which adds 0 cm to the height. The effects of these alleles are purely additive, with no influence from dominance or epistasis.\n\nThe geneticist starts with two true-breeding (homozygous) parental lines, Line A and Line B. The genotypes of these lines are:\n- Line A: `H1H1 H2H2 h3h3 h4h4`\n- Line B: `h1h1 h2h2 H3H3 H4H4`\n\nThese two parental lines are crossed to produce an F1 generation. The F1 individuals are then allowed to self-cross to produce an F2 generation. In this F2 generation, some plants exhibit heights that are significantly greater than those of the original parental lines. This phenomenon is known as transgressive segregation.\n\nCalculate the maximum possible height that can be observed in an individual plant from the F2 generation. Express your answer in centimeters (cm).", "solution": "Let the baseline height be $B=50$ cm and the additive effect per high allele be $a=10$ cm.

Contributions are $2a$ from QTL1, $2a$ from QTL2, and $0$ from QTL3 and QTL4, for a total additive contribution $4a$. Thus height is $B+4a=50+40=90$ cm.\n- Line B: $h_{1}h_{1}\\ h_{2}h_{2}\\ H_{3}H_{3}\\ H_{4}H_{4}$. Similarly, height is $B+4a=90$ cm.\n\nThe F1 from crossing Line A and Line B is $H_{1}h_{1}\\ H_{2}h_{2}\\ H_{3}h_{3}\\ H_{4}h_{4}$, contributing $a$ at each of four loci for a total $4a$, hence height $B+4a=90$ cm.\n\nIn the F2 from selfing the F1, each unlinked locus segregates with possible genotypes $HH$, $Hh$, and $hh$. The maximum additive contribution occurs when all four loci are $HH$, yielding total additive contribution $4 \\times 2a = 8a$. Therefore, the maximum possible height in the F2 is\n$$\nB + 8a = 50 + 8 \\times 10 = 130 \\text{ cm}.\n$$\nThis exceeds the parental height (transgressive segregation), and it is attainable because $HH$ is a possible F2 genotype at each locus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{130}$$", "id": "1501646"}]}
