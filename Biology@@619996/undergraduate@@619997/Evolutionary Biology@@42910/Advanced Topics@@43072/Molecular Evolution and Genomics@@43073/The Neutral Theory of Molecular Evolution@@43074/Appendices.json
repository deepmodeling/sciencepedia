Under the Neutral Theory, the ultimate fate of an allele with no selective advantage or disadvantage is governed purely by chance—a process known as genetic drift. This exercise will guide you through calculating the initial probability that a single new neutral mutation will eventually become the only version of that gene in the entire population, a concept critical for understanding how genetic variation evolves when selection is not a factor [@problem_id:1527875].", "problem": "A team of conservation biologists is monitoring an isolated population of a rare species of alpine marmot. The population size has remained stable for many generations at 400 diploid individuals. Through genetic sequencing, they identify a novel allele that has just arisen from a single, new mutation in one individual. Subsequent studies confirm that this new allele is selectively neutral; it provides no survival or reproductive advantage or disadvantage to the organism. Assuming genetic drift is the sole evolutionary mechanism influencing the fate of this allele, calculate the initial probability that this new neutral allele will eventually spread through the entire population and become fixed.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The key population-genetic principle for a selectively neutral allele in a Wright–Fisher population is that its probability of eventual fixation equals its initial allele frequency. Let $N$ denote the number of diploid individuals, so there are $2N$ gene copies at the locus.\n\nA single new mutation appears in one gene copy, so the initial allele count is $1$ and the initial allele frequency is\n$$\nx_{0}=\\frac{1}{2N}.\n$$\nFor a neutral allele, the fixation probability is\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}}=x_{0}=\\frac{1}{2N}.\n$$\nWith $N=400$ diploid individuals,\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}}=\\frac{1}{2\\times 400}=\\frac{1}{800}=0.00125.\n$$\nExpressed as a decimal to three significant figures, this is $0.00125$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00125}$$", "id": "1527875"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful predictions of the Neutral Theory is that neutral mutations should accumulate at a relatively constant rate over time, acting as a \"molecular clock.\" By comparing the genetic sequences of two species and knowing when they diverged, we can calibrate this clock and estimate the underlying rate of mutation, $\\mu$. This practice demonstrates how to use sequence divergence data from a non-functional pseudogene to calculate this fundamental evolutionary parameter [@problem_id:1527865].", "problem": "A team of molecular evolutionists is studying two species of flightless birds endemic to remote islands. They postulate that the species diverged after a single colonization event. To construct a molecular clock, they sequence a pseudogene locus—a non-coding region of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) that is presumed to be evolving neutrally, free from the pressures of natural selection.\n\nThe aligned sequences of this pseudogene from the two species are found to be 1200 base pairs in length. A direct comparison reveals that there are 36 nucleotide differences between them. Geological analysis of volcanic rock layers on the islands suggests that the ancestral population was split, leading to the divergence of the two species, approximately 6.0 million years ago.\n\nAssuming the neutral theory of molecular evolution holds for this pseudogene, calculate the average rate of neutral mutation.

The McDonald-Kreitman test is a classic method for detecting such departures from neutrality by comparing the ratio of amino acid-altering (nonsynonymous) to silent (synonymous) changes within a species versus between species. This exercise lets you apply this test to a famous example of human adaptation, allowing you to quantify evidence for positive selection on a specific gene [@problem_id:1972583].", "problem": "Researchers are investigating the molecular evolution of the *EGLN1* gene, which is associated with adaptation to high-altitude, low-oxygen environments.

The goal is to test for signatures of natural selection using the framework of the McDonald-Kreitman test.\n\nWithin the Tibetan population, they identify nucleotide variations (polymorphisms). They also identify nucleotide sites that are different but uniform (fixed) between the two populations. These changes are categorized as either synonymous (not changing the resulting amino acid) or nonsynonymous (changing the amino acid). The collected data are as follows:\n\n-   Nonsynonymous polymorphisms within the Tibetan population ($P_n$): 42 sites\n-   Synonymous polymorphisms within the Tibetan population ($P_s$): 95 sites\n-   Nonsynonymous fixed differences between the Tibetan and Han populations ($D_n$): 19 sites\n-   Synonymous fixed differences between the Tibetan and Han populations ($D_s$): 9 sites\n\nUnder the null hypothesis of neutral evolution, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes should be consistent for both polymorphisms and fixed differences. A deviation from this expectation can suggest the action of natural selection.
