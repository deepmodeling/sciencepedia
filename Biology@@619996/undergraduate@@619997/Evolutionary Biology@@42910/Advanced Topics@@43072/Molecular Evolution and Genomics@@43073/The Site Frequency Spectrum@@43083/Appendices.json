They are constructing a Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS), which is a distribution of allele frequencies, to understand the population's demographic history. For a specific genetic locus, they analyze a sample of 120 diploid individuals. At a particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) within this locus, they identify the presence of both an ancestral allele and a newer, derived allele.\n\nTheir genotyping results for this SNP are as follows:\n- 105 individuals are homozygous for the ancestral allele.\n- 13 individuals are heterozygous.\n- 2 individuals are homozygous for the derived allele.\n\nTo place this SNP into the correct category of the SFS, the biologists need to determine its derived allele count. What is the derived allele count, denoted by $k$, for this specific SNP in the sampled population?", "solution": "In a diploid sample, each individual contributes two alleles at a locus. The derived allele count, denoted by $k$, is the total number of derived alleles across all sampled chromosomes. For genotype counts, this is computed as\n$$\nk = (2 \\times \\text{number of derived homozygotes}) + (1 \\times \\text{number of heterozygotes}).\n$$\nLet $n_{DD}$ be the number of derived homozygotes, $n_{AD}$ be the number of heterozygotes, and $n_{AA}$ be the number of ancestral homozygotes. The formula is:\n$$\nk = 2 \\times n_{DD} + 1 \\times n_{AD} + 0 \\times n_{AA}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given counts $n_{DD}=2$, $n_{AD}=13$, and $n_{AA}=105$:\n$$\nk = 2 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 13 + 0 \\times 105 = 4 + 13 + 0 = 17.\n$$\nThe total number of individuals is $105 + 13 + 2 = 120$, which matches the sample size.

One of the most direct insights we can gain is the total amount of genetic variation, quantified by the number of segregating sites, $S$. This practice [@problem_id:1975043] demonstrates how to calculate $S$ by summing the entries of an SFS, reinforcing the important distinction between sites that are polymorphic within the sample and those where a derived allele has become fixed.", "problem": "A population geneticist is studying a newly discovered species of deep-sea hydrothermal vent tubeworm. The team has sequenced the full genomes of 5 diploid individuals sampled from a single vent, yielding a sample of $n=10$ chromosomes. From this data, they constructed the unfolded Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS). The SFS is a summary of genetic variation that catalogues the number of sites in the genome where a derived (i.e., mutated) allele is observed at a certain frequency.\n\nThe analysis produced the following list of counts, where the entry at index $i$ corresponds to the number of genomic sites where the derived allele was observed on exactly $i$ chromosomes:\n$[1500, 740, 510, 350, 280, 210, 190, 150, 120]$\n\nThis list represents the counts for derived allele counts $i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,$ and $9$, respectively. In addition to these polymorphic sites, the researchers also identified 85 sites where the derived allele was present in all 10 sampled individuals.\n\nBased on this data, what is the total number of segregating (polymorphic) sites observed in this sample?", "solution": "A segregating (polymorphic) site is one where at least two different alleles are observed in the sample. For an unfolded SFS from a sample of $n$ chromosomes, this corresponds to sites where the derived allele count $i$ is in the range $1 \\le i \\le n-1$.\n\nIn this case, the sample size is $n=10$ chromosomes. Therefore, the segregating sites are those with derived allele counts from $i=1$ through $i=9$. Sites where the derived allele is present in all 10 sampled chromosomes (i.e., $i=10$) are fixed for the derived allele within the sample and are not considered segregating.\n\nLet $c_{i}$ denote the count at frequency $i$. The total number of segregating sites $S$ is the sum of the provided counts for $i=1$ to $9$:\n$$\nS=\\sum_{i=1}^{9} c_{i}=1500+740+510+350+280+210+190+150+120.\n$$\nCompute the sum step by step:\n$$\n1500+740=2240,\\quad 2240+510=2750,\\quad 2750+350=3100,\n$$\n$$\n3100+280=3380,\\quad 3380+210=3590,\\quad 3590+190=3780,\n$$\n$$\n3780+150=3930,\\quad 3930+120=4050.\n$$\nTherefore, $S=4050$.
