The biologist obtains and aligns the `dnaE` gene sequences from two closely related bacterial species.

They also count the actual number of observed nucleotide differences that result in an amino acid change (non-synonymous substitutions) and those that do not (synonymous substitutions).\n\nThe rate of non-synonymous substitution, denoted as $dN$, is calculated as the number of observed non-synonymous substitutions divided by the total number of non-synonymous sites. The rate of synonymous substitution, $dS$, is calculated as the number of observed synonymous substitutions divided by the total number of synonymous sites. The ratio of these rates, $dN/dS$, is a powerful indicator of selective pressure.\n\nThe analysis of the `dnaE` gene alignment yielded the following data:\n- Total number of non-synonymous sites, $N$: 2580\n- Total number of synonymous sites, $S$: 840\n- Number of observed non-synonymous substitutions, $N_d$: 22\n- Number of observed synonymous substitutions, $S_d$: 147\n\nCalculate the $dN/dS$ ratio for the `dnaE` gene based on this data.
