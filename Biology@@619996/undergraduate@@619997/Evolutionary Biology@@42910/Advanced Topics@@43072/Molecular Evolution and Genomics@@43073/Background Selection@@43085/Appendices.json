{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our hands-on exploration, we'll start with a foundational thought experiment. This practice is designed to build your intuition for the core mechanism of background selection: the idea that selection acting on one part of a chromosome can have unintended consequences for its neighbors due to genetic linkage. By tracking the fate of a simple set of haplotypes, you will see firsthand how the removal of a single deleterious mutation can lead to the loss of an entire block of linked, perfectly neutral genetic variation [@problem_id:1910593].", "problem": "In a large, stable population of a haploid microorganism, a specific chromosomal region is known to exist in four common forms, or haplotypes. These haplotypes are distinguished by the combination of alleles they carry at three genetic loci: Locus 1, Locus 2, and Locus 3. The alleles are denoted by uppercase and lowercase letters. The four haplotypes present in the population are:\n\n- Haplotype A: G-T-R\n- Haplotype B: g-T-R\n- Haplotype C: G-t-R\n- Haplotype D: g-t-r\n\nAssume all alleles at these three loci are functionally neutral. At a certain point in time, a new, single-nucleotide mutation occurs at a fourth locus, which is very close to the other three. This mutation, denoted 'm', is strongly deleterious, significantly reducing the reproductive success of any organism that carries it. The mutation event occurred on a single chromosome that carried Haplotype B. For the purposes of this problem, you can assume that the rate of recombination within this entire four-locus region is negligible.\n\nPurifying selection will act to remove the deleterious mutation 'm' from the population. This process of removing a deleterious variant will also affect the frequencies of the neutral alleles linked to it. Which of the original haplotypes (A, B, C, or D) is most likely to be completely removed from the population as a direct consequence of the selection against mutation 'm'?\n\nA. Haplotype A\n\nB. Haplotype B\n\nC. Haplotype C\n\nD. Haplotype D\n\nE. Haplotypes A and C\n\nF. Haplotypes B and D", "solution": "We have a haploid organism with four common three-locus haplotypes: A $=$ G-T-R, B $=$ g-T-R, C $=$ G-t-R, D $=$ g-t-r. A new deleterious mutation $m$ arises at a fourth locus tightly linked to the three-locus region, with recombination rate effectively $r \\approx 0$. The mutation $m$ originated on a chromosome carrying haplotype B.\n\nKey principles:\n1) In a haploid with negligible recombination, alleles at tightly linked loci are inherited as an indivisible block. Thus the fourth-locus allele $m$ remains in complete linkage with the three-locus background on which it arose. Here, the four-locus haplotype created by the mutation event is g-T-R-m (the B background plus $m$).\n2) Purifying selection against a strongly deleterious allele $m$ reduces the fitness of carriers. Let the fitnesses be $w_{m}=1-s$ with $s>0$ for carriers of $m$, and $w_{\\text{non-}m}=1$ for others.\n3) In a large population, the deterministic recursion for the frequency $x_{m,t}$ of the $m$-bearing four-locus haplotype is\n$$\nx_{m,t+1}=\\frac{(1-s)\\,x_{m,t}}{\\bar{w}_{t}},\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{w}_{t}$ is the mean fitness. Since $01-s1$ and no new $m$ is introduced and $r=0$, it follows that $x_{m,t}\\to 0$ as $t\\to\\infty$; all $m$-bearing chromosomes are eliminated.\n4) Because $r=0$, the neutral variants at the three linked loci on those eliminated chromosomes are exactly those of haplotype B. This is the background-selection effect: purifying selection removes the deleterious mutation and simultaneously removes the linked neutral background it resides on.\n\nConsequently, only the chromosomes carrying the B background that also carry $m$ are eliminated. Haplotypes A, C, and D never carry $m$ in this scenario and so are not reduced by selection against $m$. Among the original three-locus haplotypes, the one directly linked to $m$ and therefore subject to complete removal via selection against $m$ is haplotype B. Thus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1910593"}, {"introduction": "Having established the basic principle with a simplified model, let's now apply this understanding to a more realistic scenario within a gene. The genome is not uniform; it is a mosaic of regions under strong functional constraint and regions with more freedom to change. This practice challenges you to predict how background selection shapes genetic diversity differently in a highly constrained protein-coding exon versus an adjacent, non-coding intron, illustrating one of the key real-world signatures of this evolutionary force [@problem_id:1910588].", "problem": "In the genome of a large, sexually reproducing, and randomly mating diploid population, consider a specific gene that is composed of alternating exons and introns.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, we define these terms as follows:\n- **Exons** are segments of a gene's DNA that are ultimately translated into a protein.\n- **Introns** are non-coding segments of a gene that are removed from the messenger RNA transcript before translation.\n- **Purifying selection** is the process that removes deleterious genetic mutations from a population.\n- **Genetic linkage** describes the tendency for DNA sequences that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together.\n- A **synonymous site** is a position within an exon where a change in the DNA nucleotide does not result in a change to the amino acid sequence of the protein. Such sites are often assumed to be evolving neutrally.\n\nLet us focus on a particular exon within this gene that is known to be *highly constrained*, meaning that most non-synonymous mutations within it are strongly deleterious and are thus subject to intense purifying selection. We want to compare the expected level of neutral genetic polymorphism (the amount of genetic variation) at two different locations:\n\n- **Site A**: A synonymous site located within the highly constrained exon.\n- **Site B**: A neutral site (a position with no known biological function) located within an adjacent intron.\n\nAssume that the rate at which new mutations arise is the same for both Site A and Site B. Which of the following statements most accurately predicts the relative levels of neutral polymorphism at these two sites?\n\nA. The level of polymorphism at Site A will be greater than at Site B.\n\nB. The level of polymorphism at Site A will be less than at Site B.\n\nC. The level of polymorphism at Site A will be equal to at Site B.\n\nD. The relationship cannot be predicted without knowing the overall size of the population.\n\nE. The relationship cannot be predicted without knowing the precise mutation rate.", "solution": "We compare neutral polymorphism at two sites with the same mutation rate, one at a synonymous site within a highly constrained exon (Site A) and one at a neutral site in an adjacent intron (Site B). Under neutral theory in a large, randomly mating diploid population, the expected pairwise diversity at a neutral site is\n$$\n\\pi = 4 N_{e} \\mu,\n$$\nwhere $N_{e}$ is the effective population size and $\\mu$ is the neutral mutation rate per site. Linked selection modifies the local effective population size via background selection (purifying selection against deleterious mutations at linked sites) and potentially via hitchhiking. This can be modeled by a multiplicative reduction factor $B \\in (0,1]$ such that\n$$\nN_{e}^{*} = B N_{e},\n$$\nand hence the local neutral diversity is\n$$\n\\pi^{*} = 4 N_{e}^{*} \\mu = 4 B N_{e} \\mu.\n$$\n\nThe factor $B$ is smaller (stronger reduction) when the density and strength of purifying selection on linked sites is higher and when recombination is lower, because tighter genetic linkage increases the effect of selection at nearby sites on neutral variation. A highly constrained exon contains many sites where nonsynonymous mutations are strongly deleterious; thus, a synonymous site within that exon is tightly linked to many selected sites, leading to a smaller $B$ for Site A. In contrast, a neutral site in the adjacent intron is linked to fewer strongly selected targets within the exon and is, on average, less affected by background selection, implying a larger $B$ for Site B.\n\nLet $B_{A}$ and $B_{B}$ denote the background selection factors at Sites A and B, respectively. With the same mutation rate $\\mu$ at both sites, the expected neutral polymorphisms are\n$$\n\\pi_{A} = 4 B_{A} N_{e} \\mu,\\quad \\pi_{B} = 4 B_{B} N_{e} \\mu.\n$$\nBecause the exon is highly constrained, $B_{A}  B_{B}$, so\n$$\n\\pi_{A}  \\pi_{B}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the level of neutral polymorphism at the synonymous site within the highly constrained exon will be less than at the neutral site in the adjacent intron. This prediction does not require knowing the precise values of $N_{e}$ or $\\mu$, since those factors are common to both sites and either cancel in the comparison or are specified to be equal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1910588"}, {"introduction": "One of the central tasks in modern population genomics is to disentangle the effects of different evolutionary forces. Both background selection (BGS) and positive selection in the form of recurrent selective sweeps (RSS) can reduce genetic diversity in regions of low recombination. This practice puts you in the role of a genomic detective, tasked with finding a key piece of evidence in the pattern of allele frequencies that can distinguish between these two powerful, yet distinct, evolutionary processes [@problem_id:1910611].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying a plant species with a large and complex genome. By sequencing the genomes of many individuals from a single large population, she observes a strong positive correlation between the local rate of meiotic recombination and the amount of neutral genetic diversity. This means that regions of the chromosome that recombine frequently harbor more genetic variation than regions that rarely recombine.\n\nTwo primary hypotheses are proposed to explain this observation:\n1.  **Background Selection (BGS):** Deleterious mutations are constantly arising throughout the genome. Purifying selection removes these mutations, and due to genetic linkage, neutral variants nearby are also inadvertently removed from the population. This effect is stronger in regions of low recombination, reducing diversity there.\n2.  **Recurrent Selective Sweeps (RSS):** New beneficial mutations occasionally arise and are rapidly driven to fixation by positive selection. As a beneficial allele \"sweeps\" through the population, it carries linked neutral variants with it, wiping out genetic diversity in the surrounding region (a phenomenon known as genetic hitchhiking). This effect is also stronger in regions of low recombination.\n\nThe biologist needs to perform an additional analysis to distinguish between these two hypotheses. Which of the following potential findings would provide the strongest evidence that Recurrent Selective Sweeps (RSS) are a more significant contributor to the observed pattern than Background Selection (BGS)?\n\nA. Low-recombination regions exhibit a site frequency spectrum (SFS) that is significantly skewed towards an excess of rare alleles, resulting in a more negative average Tajima's D statistic compared to high-recombination regions.\n\nB. Genes located in low-recombination regions show a significantly lower ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions ($dN/dS$) compared to genes in high-recombination regions.\n\nC. The average level of linkage disequilibrium (LD), a measure of the non-random association of alleles at different loci, is significantly higher in low-recombination regions compared to high-recombination regions.\n\nD. A comparison with a closely related species reveals that the overall rate of neutral substitution is uniform across all recombination environments.", "solution": "The core of the problem is to identify a genomic signature that can differentiate between the effects of background selection (BGS) and recurrent selective sweeps (RSS). Both hypotheses predict the same general correlation: higher neutral genetic diversity in regions of higher recombination. Therefore, we need to look for a more subtle pattern in the genetic data that is characteristic of one process but not the other.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the expected consequences of each process.\n- **Background Selection (BGS)**: This process involves the continuous purging of deleterious mutations. The effect on linked neutral sites is akin to a local reduction in the effective population size ($N_e$). This reduces the number of neutral polymorphisms that can be maintained in the region, thus lowering overall diversity. However, BGS reduces diversity without dramatically altering the shape of the population's gene genealogy in a specific, directional way. It just shortens the branches. As a result, the distribution of allele frequencies (the Site Frequency Spectrum or SFS) is expected to scale down but not be strongly skewed. Summary statistics of the SFS, such as Tajima's D, are expected to be close to zero under a pure BGS model.\n\n- **Recurrent Selective Sweeps (RSS)**: This process is episodic. When a beneficial allele sweeps to fixation, it erases nearly all linked variation. Following the sweep, the population in that genomic region is essentially clonal. New neutral mutations then begin to accumulate on this uniform background. These new mutations will, by definition, be very young and therefore exist at very low frequencies in the population (i.e., they will be singletons, doubletons, etc.). This leads to a very specific distortion of the SFS: a large excess of rare alleles and a corresponding deficit of intermediate-frequency alleles. This particular skew is captured by a significantly negative value of Tajima's D.\n\nNow we can evaluate the options based on this understanding:\n\n- **Option A**: This option describes finding a more negative average Tajima's D in low-recombination regions. A negative Tajima's D indicates an excess of rare alleles, which is the classic signature of a recent selective sweep. Since the effects of a sweep are stronger and cover a wider physical distance in regions of low recombination, we would expect to see this signature more frequently or more strongly in those regions if RSS is a dominant force. This observation directly supports the RSS hypothesis over the BGS hypothesis, which does not predict such a strong skew.\n\n- **Option B**: This option describes finding a lower $dN/dS$ ratio in low-recombination regions. The $dN/dS$ ratio compares the rate of non-synonymous (protein-altering) substitutions to synonymous (silent) substitutions. A low $dN/dS$ ratio ($dN/dS \\ll 1$) is the hallmark of strong purifying selection, which acts to remove deleterious amino acid changes. Since BGS is *caused* by purifying selection acting against deleterious mutations, this finding would provide strong evidence *for* the Background Selection hypothesis, not the RSS hypothesis.\n\n- **Option C**: This option describes finding higher linkage disequilibrium (LD) in low-recombination regions. By definition, low recombination leads to higher LD because alleles are less likely to be shuffled onto different genetic backgrounds. This is a fundamental property of meiosis and genetics, and it is the underlying reason why *both* BGS and RSS have stronger effects in these regions. Therefore, observing higher LD in low-recombination regions is expected under any model and does not help to distinguish between BGS and RSS.\n\n- **Option D**: This option states that the neutral substitution rate is uniform. The neutral substitution rate between species is determined by the neutral mutation rate, not by within-population processes like BGS or RSS. Both BGS and RSS affect the level of *polymorphism* (variation *within* a population) but not the rate of *substitution* (fixed differences *between* species). Therefore, this observation is consistent with neutral theory and does not provide any information to distinguish BGS from RSS.\n\n**Conclusion**: The most powerful piece of evidence to distinguish RSS from BGS is the characteristic skew in the site frequency spectrum caused by a selective sweep. Option A describes exactly this signature (excess rare alleles, negative Tajima's D) and correctly predicts it would be more pronounced in low-recombination regions, making it the strongest evidence for the RSS hypothesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1910611"}]}
