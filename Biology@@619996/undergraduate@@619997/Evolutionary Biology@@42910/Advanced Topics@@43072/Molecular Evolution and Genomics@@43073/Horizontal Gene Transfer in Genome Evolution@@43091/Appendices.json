This practice demonstrates a fundamental technique used to identify potential horizontal gene transfer events directly from sequence data.", "problem": "In the field of genomics, the analysis of codon usage bias is a powerful tool for studying genome evolution. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids are encoded by more than one three-nucleotide codon. However, organisms often show a preference, or \"bias,\" for using one synonymous codon over others. This bias is a characteristic signature of a genome. When a gene is acquired from a different species via Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), its codon usage pattern may starkly contrast with that of its new host's genome, betraying its foreign origin.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist is studying the genome of a newly discovered bacterium, *Exiguobacterium analyticum*. The genome contains a gene, designated `xtrA`, which confers resistance to a novel antibiotic. To investigate the origin of this gene, the biologist decides to compare its codon usage to the average codon usage of the entire *E. analyticum* genome.\n\nA simple way to quantify this difference is to calculate a Codon Usage Dissimilarity Index (CUDI). For this problem, the CUDI is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the relative frequency of each codon in the gene of interest and its corresponding relative frequency in the host genome, summed over all codons for a selected set of amino acids. The relative frequency for a given amino acid's set of codons must sum to 1.\n\nYou are provided with the relative codon usage frequencies for two amino acids, Leucine and Arginine.\n\nFor the amino acid Leucine (Leu), encoded by codons CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG, UUA, and UUG, the relative frequencies are:\n- *E. analyticum* Genome Average: CUU (0.08), CUC (0.12), CUA (0.04), CUG (0.52), UUA (0.06), UUG (0.18)\n- `xtrA` Gene: CUU (0.25), CUC (0.25), CUA (0.15), CUG (0.10), UUA (0.15), UUG (0.10)\n\nFor the amino acid Arginine (Arg), encoded by codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG, the relative frequencies are:\n- *E. analyticum* Genome Average: CGU (0.21), CGC (0.24), CGA (0.05), CGG (0.08), AGA (0.22), AGG (0.20)\n- `xtrA` Gene: CGU (0.06), CGC (0.04), CGA (0.25), CGG (0.25), AGA (0.20), AGG (0.20)\n\nCalculate the Codon Usage Dissimilarity Index (CUDI) for the `xtrA` gene with respect to the *E. analyticum* genome, using only the data provided for Leucine and Arginine.

The evolutionary history of a single mobile gene may not match the history of the organisms that carry it. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1938644] explores a classic case of discordance between a species tree, based on a universally conserved gene, and a gene tree, based on a horizontally transferred plasmid. Working through this problem will clarify how HGT can create seemingly contradictory phylogenetic signals and why it's a crucial factor in microbial evolution.", "problem": "Imagine three species of bacteria, designated *Bacillus exemplar A*, *Bacillus exemplar B*, and *Bacillus exemplar C*. A comprehensive genomic analysis using highly conserved genes, such as those for 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), has robustly established that species A and B are sister taxa, meaning they share a more recent common ancestor with each other than either does with species C. The established evolutionary relationship, or species tree, is therefore (A, B), C.\n\nA separate investigation focuses on a single gene, `luxZ`, which codes for an enzyme that allows the bacteria to fluoresce in the presence of a specific substrate. This gene is known to be located on a plasmid, a small, circular piece of DNA that can be transferred between bacterial cells through a process known as Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). Genetic sequencing reveals that species B and species C possess a `luxZ` gene with 99.8% nucleotide identity, while species A completely lacks the `luxZ` gene.\n\nA researcher constructs two different phylogenetic trees: one using the 16S rRNA gene sequence and another using only the `luxZ` gene sequence. Which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcomes of this analysis and offers the most scientifically sound evolutionary interpretation?\n\nA. The 16S rRNA tree will group A and B together, while the `luxZ` tree will group B and C together. This discrepancy is best explained by the `luxZ` gene being transferred horizontally from the lineage of C to the lineage of B.\n\nB. The `luxZ` gene tree, which groups B and C together, reflects the true evolutionary history of the species. The 16S rRNA gene must have undergone an unusual evolutionary event that makes A and B appear closely related.\n\nC. The data suggests that species B is a hybrid organism that resulted from the fusion of an ancestral A cell and an ancestral C cell, thereby inheriting genes from both lineages.\n\nD. The 16S rRNA tree is correct. The high similarity of the `luxZ` gene in B and C is a result of convergent evolution, where both species independently evolved nearly identical gene sequences to adapt to a similar environment.\n\nE. The ancestral species that gave rise to both A and B possessed the `luxZ` gene. Species A subsequently lost the gene, while the gene in species B remained identical to the one in species C due to strong purifying selection.", "solution": "We are told that a robust species tree from conserved, vertically inherited genes (e.g., 16S rRNA) is $(A,B),C$, meaning A and B are sister taxa. A separate locus, the plasmid-borne gene `luxZ`, is present in B and C with sequence identity of 0.998, and absent from A. Two gene trees are constructed: one from 16S rRNA and one from `luxZ`. We must predict the likely topologies and provide the most scientifically sound interpretation of any discordance.\n\nPrinciple 1: Core, housekeeping genes like 16S rRNA typically reflect vertical descent and are highly conserved, with horizontal gene transfer (HGT) being rare for these loci. Therefore, the 16S tree is expected to recover the species tree $(A,B),C$.\n\nPrinciple 2: Genes on plasmids are frequently transferred via HGT among bacterial lineages. Extremely high nucleotide identity (0.998) between `luxZ` in B and C indicates very recent shared ancestry of that gene sequence, which is far more parsimoniously explained by recent HGT between B and C than by long-term vertical inheritance with purifying selection.\n\nPrediction for the 16S rRNA tree: It will group A and B together, consistent with $(A,B),C$.\n\nPrediction for the `luxZ` gene tree: Because B and C share an almost identical plasmid-borne `luxZ` sequence and A lacks `luxZ`, the `luxZ`-only tree will group B and C together.\n\nEvaluation of explanations:\n- HGT interpretation: A single recent HGT event of `luxZ` between B and C (direction uncertain from the given data) explains the near-identical sequences in B and C and the absence in A. This yields a gene tree discordant with the species tree, a classic signature of HGT affecting a mobile gene.\n- Rejecting convergence: Convergent evolution producing nearly identical nucleotide sequences across the entire gene (identity 0.998) is extraordinarily unlikely; convergence typically affects amino acids at a subset of sites and does not yield near-identical nucleotide sequences genome-wide.\n- Rejecting the `luxZ` tree as the species tree: A plasmid locus is not a reliable marker of species relationships, especially when it is highly mobile; moreover, 16S rRNA is the standard for species-level phylogeny and is far less prone to HGT.\n- Rejecting hybrid organism fusion: Bacterial “hybridization” via whole-cell fusion is not the standard explanation; bacterial gene flow is typically via HGT of specific loci, not wholesale genome fusion. Core genes still group A with B, contrary to a genomic mosaic that would be expected from extensive hybridization.\n- Rejecting ancestral `luxZ` in AB with loss in A and strict identity retained in B and C: This requires multiple assumptions (ancestral presence, loss in A, and extremely constrained evolution in both lineages maintaining near identity across a time span sufficient for A and B to diverge from C). The near identity between B and C strongly indicates a recent common history of that sequence, which is best explained by HGT.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction and interpretation are that the 16S rRNA tree places A and B as sister taxa, while the `luxZ` tree places B and C together, and the discrepancy is best explained by HGT of `luxZ` between B and C. Among the provided choices, option A captures this outcome and interpretation most accurately (noting that while the exact direction of transfer is not strictly resolvable from the given information, the HGT explanation is correct and is the central point of the option).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1938644"}, {"introduction": "The fate of a newly acquired gene is not guaranteed; it is a dynamic process governed by a tug-of-war between costs and benefits.

The chemostat is maintained at a constant dilution rate $D$. The nutrient is supplied in the inflow at a concentration $N_{in}$.

The yield coefficient, representing the mass of bacteria produced per mass of nutrient consumed, is $Y$.\n\nA persistent antibiotic contaminant is introduced into the chemostat's inflow, which induces a death rate $k$ on the susceptible bacteria. To counteract this, a plasmid conferring complete antibiotic resistance becomes available. Bacteria that acquire this plasmid, with concentration $R(t)$, are immune to the antibiotic.

Thus, the growth rate of the resistant strain is $\\mu_R(N) = (1-c)\\mu_S(N)$.\n\nThe plasmid can be transferred from a resistant bacterium to a susceptible one via conjugation, a form of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), at a rate proportional to the product of their concentrations, governed by the rate constant $\\beta$.
