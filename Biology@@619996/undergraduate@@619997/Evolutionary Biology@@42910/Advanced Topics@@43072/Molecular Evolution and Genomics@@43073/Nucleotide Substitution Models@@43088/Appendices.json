This exercise provides a foundational skill: distinguishing between transitions and transversions, which are two fundamental classes of substitution with different biochemical likelihoods. By manually counting these events in aligned sequences, you will calculate the transition/transversion ratio ($\\kappa$), a key parameter in more complex evolutionary models.", "problem": "In molecular evolution, the analysis of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence divergence is fundamental to understanding evolutionary relationships. Nucleotide substitutions are not equally likely. The four nucleotide bases are classified into two chemical groups: purines (Adenine, A, and Guanine, G) and pyrimidines (Cytosine, C, and Thymine, T).\n\nA substitution between bases within the same group (e.g., A to G, or C to T) is called a **transition**. A substitution between bases of different groups (e.g., A to C, or G to T) is called a **transversion**. The ratio of the number of transitions to the number of transversions is a key parameter in many models of molecular evolution.\n\nConsider the following two short, aligned DNA sequences from homologous genes in two different species:\n\nSequence 1: `G C A A T G C A T C G G T A C`\nSequence 2: `G G A T T A C G T T G C T A T`\n\nBy directly comparing these two sequences position by position, determine a simple estimate for the transition/transversion ratio, denoted by the Greek letter kappa ($\\kappa$).
