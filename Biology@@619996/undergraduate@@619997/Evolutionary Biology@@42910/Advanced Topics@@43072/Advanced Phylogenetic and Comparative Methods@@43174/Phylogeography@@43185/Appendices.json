By considering a hypothetical species expanding from a single Ice Age refugium, you will apply the principle of serial founder effects to predict how genetic diversity is spatially structured across a continent. This practice is essential for learning to connect large-scale historical processes to observable genetic data. [@problem_id:1954825]", "problem": "Imagine a species of flightless beetle, *Cryophilus expandens*, that currently inhabits a wide range of temperate forests in Europe. Paleoclimatological and fossil evidence strongly suggest that during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), approximately 20,000 years ago, the entire species was restricted to a single, large refugium in the Iberian Peninsula (modern-day Spain and Portugal). As the glaciers retreated, the beetles expanded northwards, colonizing the newly available habitats over thousands of years.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist plans to sample two populations to study the genetic legacy of this expansion.\n-   **Population S:** Located in a mountain forest in Northern Spain, near the center of the proposed LGM refugium.\n-   **Population N:** Located in a forest in Southern Sweden, representing the northernmost limit of the species' current range.\n\nAssuming the expansion occurred as a wave of colonization from south to north and that there has been limited gene flow between distant populations since the initial expansion, which of the following statements is the most accurate prediction regarding the neutral genetic diversity (e.g., number of alleles per locus, heterozygosity) of these two populations?\n\nA. Population S will have higher genetic diversity than Population N, because Population N was established through a series of founder events that progressively reduced genetic variation during the northward expansion.\n\nB. Population N will have higher genetic diversity than Population S, because the challenges of colonizing new, harsher northern environments would have spurred rapid mutation and adaptation.\n\nC. Population S and Population N will have approximately equal genetic diversity, because 20,000 years is a sufficient amount of time for gene flow and mutation to homogenize the gene pool across the entire species' range.\n\nD. Population S will have lower genetic diversity than Population N, because the refugial population likely experienced a severe bottleneck during the LGM, while the expanding northern populations grew rapidly.\n\nE. The relative genetic diversity cannot be predicted, as the pattern is primarily determined by unpredictable local events of selection and extinction that occurred independently in each population.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the relative neutral genetic diversity of a southern (\"rear edge\") population and a northern (\"leading edge\") population of a species that expanded from a single glacial refugium. The core principles at play are the founder effect and genetic drift, which are central to the field of phylogeography.\n\nFirst, let's establish the historical context. The entire species survived the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in a single refugium in the Iberian Peninsula. This refugial population contained the total genetic diversity of the species at that time.\n\nSecond, let's consider the process of range expansion. The northward expansion was not an instantaneous movement of the entire population. Instead, it occurred as a \"wave of colonization,\" where small groups of individuals from the edge of the range would migrate a short distance north to establish a new population. This process was repeated over many generations, covering the distance from Spain to Sweden.\n\nThird, we apply the concept of the founder effect. Each time a new population is established by a small number of colonizing individuals, these \"founders\" carry only a subset of the genetic variation present in the larger source population. This random sampling of alleles is a classic example of genetic drift known as the founder effect.\n\nFourth, we consider the cumulative impact of this process, known as \"serial founder effects.\" The first population established just north of the refugium would have experienced one founder effect, resulting in a slight reduction in genetic diversity compared to the refugial population. A population established further north from this new population would experience a second founder effect, and so on. This creates a gradient of decreasing genetic diversity with increasing distance from the original refugium.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two specific populations:\n-   **Population S (Spain):** This population is located within the original LGM refugium. It represents the \"rear edge\" of the expansion. As such, it is the direct descendant of the ancestral source population and has not been subjected to the chain of founder effects that characterized the northward expansion. It is expected to have retained a high level of the ancestral genetic diversity.\n-   **Population N (Sweden):** This population is at the \"leading edge\" of the expansion, the furthest point from the refugium. Its ancestors must have gone through a long series of successive founder events during the multi-millennial journey from Spain. Each step of this journey would have filtered out some genetic diversity. Therefore, Population N is expected to have significantly lower genetic diversity than Population S.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the given options based on this reasoning:\n-   **A:** This statement correctly predicts that Population S will have higher diversity than Population N and correctly attributes this pattern to serial founder events during the northward expansion. This aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n-   **B:** This statement is incorrect. While local adaptation to new environments certainly occurs, it does not typically lead to an overall *increase* in neutral genetic diversity compared to the larger, older source population. The dominant force shaping large-scale patterns of neutral diversity during rapid expansion is genetic drift (founder effects), which causes a loss of variation.\n-   **C:** This statement is incorrect. While gene flow acts to homogenize populations, it is often a slow process, especially for a flightless beetle over continental distances. The strong signature of drift from the rapid post-glacial expansion is a well-documented phenomenon and is not easily erased by subsequent gene flow in such a short evolutionary timeframe.\n-   **D:** This statement incorrectly assesses the effect of the bottleneck. While the refugial population was likely smaller than the total pre-LGM population, it was the source of *all* subsequent diversity. The key process is the *loss* of this diversity during expansion, not a greater bottleneck in the south compared to the expansion process itself. The expansion process is a series of bottlenecks.\n-   **E:** This statement is incorrect. While local events do matter, the large-scale, directional process of post-glacial expansion from a single refugium creates a highly predictable continental-scale pattern of genetic diversity (a south-to-north decline). It is one of the most classic and robust patterns in phylogeography.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the southern population (S) will be more genetically diverse than the northern population (N).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1954825"}, {"introduction": "How can we visualize a population's demographic history from a set of DNA sequences? This problem introduces the mismatch distribution, a powerful graphical tool for decoding demographic signatures from pairwise genetic differences. You will compare the distinct distributions from two different species to learn how a history of rapid population expansion creates a dramatically different genetic pattern than a history of long-term stability or complex structure. [@problem_id:1954835]", "problem": "A conservation biologist is studying the population history of two related but geographically isolated butterfly species, *Papilio spectabilis* and *Papilio opacus*. For each species, the biologist collects samples from numerous individuals and sequences a non-coding region of their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Using this sequence data, the biologist constructs a mismatch distribution for each population. A mismatch distribution is a histogram showing the frequency of each observed number of pairwise nucleotide differences (mismatches) between all possible pairs of DNA sequences in the sample.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n- For *Papilio spectabilis*, the mismatch distribution is smooth and distinctly unimodal, resembling a bell-shaped curve with a single, clear peak.\n- For *Papilio opacus*, the mismatch distribution is described as \"ragged\" and is clearly multimodal, displaying several distinct peaks of varying heights.\n\nBased on these observations and the principles of phylogeography, which of the following statements most accurately contrasts the likely demographic histories of the two populations?\n\nA. *P. spectabilis* likely experienced a recent and rapid population expansion, while *P. opacus* has likely maintained a relatively stable population size over a long period or has a more complex history involving population subdivision.\n\nB. *P. opacus* likely experienced a recent and rapid population expansion, while *P. spectabilis* has likely maintained a relatively stable population size over a long period or has a more complex history involving population subdivision.\n\nC.

Both populations are likely ancient and stable. The smooth distribution in *P. spectabilis* is caused by strong purifying selection eliminating new mutations, while the ragged distribution in *P. opacus* indicates relaxed selection.\n\nE. The unimodal distribution for *P. spectabilis* suggests that it descends from a single ancestral population, whereas the multimodal distribution for *P. opacus* indicates that it is a hybrid species formed from the recent mixing of several distinct populations.", "solution": "A mismatch distribution is the histogram of the number of pairwise nucleotide differences among all pairs of sequences in a sample. Under coalescent theory, the shape of this distribution reflects demographic history because it integrates over the distribution of coalescent times of pairs of lineages.\n\nPrinciple 1 (sudden demographic expansion): If a population has undergone a recent, rapid expansion from a smaller size, genealogies tend to be star-like, with many coalescent events compressed near the onset of the expansion. Under the sudden expansion model, the expected distribution of pairwise differences is smooth and unimodal, closely approximated by a Poisson-like wave with peak around a parameter $\\tau$ that scales with time since expansion and mutation rate. Formally, an idealized prediction is that the probability that a random pair differs by $k$ sites is approximately $P(K=k) \\propto \\exp(-\\tau)\\,\\tau^{k}/k!$, where $\\tau$ is the mutational time since expansion and satisfies $\\tau \\propto 2 \\mu t$ for pairwise differences, with $\\mu$ the per-sequence mutation rate and $t$ the time since expansion in generations. The resulting histogram is smooth and distinctly unimodal (a single clear peak).\n\nPrinciple 2 (long-term stability or population structure): If a population has maintained a relatively constant size over a long time, the distribution of pairwise coalescent times is broad and multimodal due to lineage sorting over many time scales; population subdivision or complex demographic events (e.g., bottlenecks, repeated contractions/expansions, or admixture among differentiated demes) further induces multiple modes. Empirically, such histories yield a “ragged” and clearly multimodal mismatch distribution with several peaks of varying heights. Harpending’s raggedness index is higher in such cases, reflecting irregularity.\n\nApplication to observations:\n- For Papilio spectabilis, the mismatch distribution is smooth and distinctly unimodal. By Principle 1, this pattern is the signature of a recent and rapid demographic expansion from a smaller ancestral size, producing a star-like genealogy and a unimodal wave centered near $\\tau$.\n- For Papilio opacus, the mismatch distribution is ragged and clearly multimodal. By Principle 2, this pattern is consistent with a population that has been demographically stable for a long time and/or exhibits population subdivision or a more complex demographic history rather than a single recent expansion.\n\nEvaluation of statements:\n- Option A matches the above: P. spectabilis had a recent rapid expansion; P. opacus is stable or complex/subdivided. This is consistent with the standard Rogers–Harpending interpretation.\n- Option B reverses the inference and is inconsistent with the observed shapes.\n- Option C misattributes unimodality to a severe bottleneck; while bottlenecks can affect patterns, the hallmark of a recent sudden expansion is unimodality, not of an ongoing severe bottleneck, and multiple simultaneous expansions are not required to explain multimodality.\n- Option D invokes selection differences; the data are from a non-coding mtDNA region where purifying selection is minimal, and selection is not the standard explanation for these shapes; moreover, ancient stability typically yields raggedness, not a smooth unimodal pattern.\n- Option E invokes hybrid origin for multimodality and claims unimodality implies descent from a single ancestral population; mismatch distributions by themselves do not diagnose hybrid speciation, and unimodality does not uniquely imply a single ancestral population beyond the expansion signature.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate contrast is given by Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1954835"}, {"introduction": "Phylogeographic research often involves testing well-defined, competing historical scenarios. This practice challenges you to act as a data detective, using multiple pieces of genetic evidence—within-population nucleotide diversity ($\\pi$) and between-population differentiation ($F_{ST}$)—to solve a classic puzzle.

Two primary hypotheses are under consideration.

The second, the \"Multiple Microrefugia Hypothesis\" (MMH), suggests that several small, isolated populations persisted in distinct, geographically separated microrefugia (e.g., warmer, unglaciated mountain valleys) and expanded locally after the climate warmed.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, the researcher sampled individuals from four geographically distinct mountain-top populations, labeled A, B, C, and D. For each population, a large set of nuclear genetic markers was analyzed to calculate two standard population genetic summary statistics: nucleotide diversity ($\\pi$), which measures the average number of nucleotide differences per site between any two DNA sequences chosen randomly from a population, and pairwise Wright's Fixation Index ($F_{ST}$), which quantifies the level of genetic differentiation between two populations.

The statistic $\\pi$ measures within-population genetic variation; higher values indicate larger long-term effective size or retention of ancestral diversity. The statistic $F_{ST}$ measures relative genetic differentiation between populations; values near $0$ indicate little differentiation (suggesting recent common ancestry or ongoing gene flow), whereas values approaching $1$ indicate deep divergence (suggesting long-term isolation).\n\nExpectations under SLRH: If the species persisted in a single large refuge and subsequently recolonized, then after post-glacial expansion one expects relatively low $F_{ST}$ among all populations (recent common source and homogenization), possibly a shallow pattern of isolation-by-distance rather than discrete, deeply divergent clusters. Nucleotide diversity $\\pi$ might be moderate to high if the ancestral refuge was large, but high $\\pi$ alone is not diagnostic of SLRH; crucially, a single source should not produce pairs of populations that are deeply subdivided relative to others, unless there has been extensive, recent post-expansion isolation driving strong divergence, which would typically be more gradual or clinal across geography rather than forming two tightly cohesive clusters.\n\nExpectations under MMH: If multiple small, isolated refugia existed, then populations descending from different refugia should show high $F_{ST}$ between them (deep divergence due to long-term isolation), while populations within the same refugium should show low $F_{ST}$ (shared history and potential local connectivity). Nucleotide diversity $\\pi$ under MMH need not be uniformly low; if refugia maintained sufficient effective sizes over time, $\\pi$ can remain moderate to high. Thus, MMH predicts a pattern of discrete clusters with low internal $F_{ST}$ and high between-cluster $F_{ST}$.\n\nEvaluate the data:\n1) Pairwise $F_{ST}$ shows two clear clusters:\n- Within-cluster low differentiation: $F_{ST}(\\text{A,B}) = 0.05$ and $F_{ST}(\\text{C,D}) = 0.04$ indicate little differentiation within each pair.\n- Between-cluster high differentiation: $F_{ST}$ between A or B versus C or D ranges from $0.42$ to $0.48$, indicating deep divergence between these groups.\nThis discrete two-cluster structure (AB versus CD) with low within-cluster and high between-cluster $F_{ST}$ strongly matches MMH expectations of long-term isolation in separate refugia, followed by local expansion.\n\n2) Within-population nucleotide diversity $\\pi$ is similar and relatively high across all populations (A: $0.012$, B: $0.011$, C: $0.013$, D: $0.015$). These values do not indicate severe bottlenecks; they are consistent with refugia that maintained reasonable effective sizes. Therefore, the data do not support the claim that low $\\pi$ across all populations occurred.\n\nAssess the options:\n- A: Supported. The $F_{ST}$ matrix indicates two deeply divergent clusters (AB and CD) with low internal differentiation and high inter-cluster differentiation, consistent with long-term isolation in separate refugia under MMH; the $\\pi$ values do not contradict this.\n- B: Not supported. SLRH would predict low differentiation across all populations or a smooth isolation-by-distance pattern, not two sharply distinct clusters with $F_{ST}$ near one-half between them.\n- C: Not supported. It asserts low nucleotide diversity, which is contradicted by the observed $\\pi$ values.\n- D: Not supported. It generalizes low $F_{ST}$ to all populations, but between-cluster $F_{ST}$ is high, contradicting recent homogenization from a single source.\n- E: Not supported. The signals are not contradictory: high $\\pi$ with structured, high between-cluster $F_{ST}$ coherently supports MMH with sizeable refugia.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly supported conclusion is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1954823"}]}
