This practice challenges you to think like a detective, predicting the graphical shape of a skyline plot for two species with starkly contrasting demographic histories: one experiencing a slow, gradual decline and the other a sudden, catastrophic crash. By connecting these known historical scenarios to their expected genetic patterns, you will strengthen your ability to interpret real-world plots [@problem_id:1964791].", "problem": "A molecular ecologist is investigating the demographic histories of two distinct, non-migrating vertebrate species to inform conservation strategies. The two species have faced different historical pressures:\n\n- **Species A** has experienced a long-term, gradual reduction in its available habitat over the last 50,000 years due to progressive climate aridification. This process is thought to have caused a slow but steady decline in its total population numbers.\n- **Species B**, in contrast, is known from historical records to have suffered a sudden and catastrophic population crash approximately 500 years ago due to the introduction of a novel, highly virulent pathogen, from which only a very small number of individuals survived.\n\nThe ecologist collects mitochondrial DNA sequences from a representative sample of individuals from each species and uses these data to generate a Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP) for each. The BSP is a method that estimates the historical effective population size ($N_e$) as a function of time.\n\nAssuming the underlying assumptions of the method are met and the genetic data are informative, which of the following statements best describes the expected qualitative shape of the two skyline plots?

Under coalescent theory, the instantaneous rate at which lineages coalesce at time $t$ scales inversely with effective size, so the overall coalescent intensity follows $\\lambda(t) \\propto \\frac{1}{N_{e}(t)}$ (ignoring constants and the time-varying number of lineages). Thus:\n- A gradual decline in $N_{e}(t)$ yields a gradual increase in coalescent rate through time toward the present, producing a smooth, gently decreasing skyline in $N_{e}$.\n- A sudden crash (bottleneck) at a recent time $t_{0}$ yields an abrupt change from a higher historic $N_{e}$ to a much lower recent $N_{e}$, reflected as a near-vertical drop in the skyline near $t_{0}$, assuming the genetic data have sufficient resolution, as stipulated.\n\nApply to each species:\n\n1) Species A: Long-term, gradual habitat loss over approximately 50,000 years implies a slow, sustained decline in census size and hence in $N_{e}$. Therefore, the BSP should show a gentle, continuous decline in $N_{e}$ across a long timescale, without an abrupt drop at the recent end.\n\n2) Species B: A sudden, catastrophic crash approximately 500 years ago implies a long period of relatively stable, higher $N_{e}$ before the crash, followed by an abrupt reduction to a much smaller $N_{e}$ near the present. Under the given assumption that the data are informative and method assumptions are met, the BSP should show a relatively flat, high $N_{e}$ historically, then a near-vertical drop in the recent past.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A matches the expected qualitative patterns for both Species A and B as derived above.\n- B reverses the patterns and is inconsistent with the described histories.\n- C posits steady exponential growth for both, which contradicts the explicit declines.\n- D asserts identical plots with recent severe declines for both, contradicting the gradual, long-term decline for Species A.\n- E claims Species A would appear flat due to resolution limits and that Species B would be U-shaped (bottleneck plus strong recovery), neither of which is supported by the stated assumptions and history (no recovery is described for B, and the problem specifies informative data).\n\nTherefore, the correct qualitative description is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1964791"}, {"introduction": "Coalescent models are powerful, but their inferences are only as reliable as their underlying assumptions. This final practice explores a critical and common pitfall in demographic inference: the violation of the panmixia assumption, which posits a single, randomly mating population. You will analyze how a biased sampling scheme—collecting individuals from only one small part of a large, structured population—can lead to a systematic misinterpretation of the genetic data and produce a skyline plot that does not reflect the true history of the species as a whole [@problem_id:1964782].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the long-term population history of a migratory bird species. The species has a very large and widespread population, utilizing numerous distinct breeding grounds during the summer. To reconstruct the species' demographic history, the biologist plans to generate a skyline plot, a method that infers historical population dynamics from genetic data. A skyline plot estimates the effective population size (denoted as $N_e$), which is the size of an idealized population that would experience the same amount of genetic drift as the actual population being studied. The estimation is based on the coalescent process, where the time between events where gene lineages merge (coalesce) is used to infer $N_e$ at different points in the past. Specifically, a smaller $N_e$ leads to faster coalescence, while a larger $N_e$ leads to slower coalescence.\n\nDue to funding and logistical challenges, the biologist is only able to collect genetic samples from 25 individuals captured at a single, small breeding ground. This sample is then used to generate the skyline plot intended to represent the entire species.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the most likely systematic bias that will be present in the resulting skyline plot, when compared to the true demographic history of the entire species?\n\nA. The resulting plot will falsely infer a much smaller effective population size for the recent past than the true size for the entire species.\n\nB. The resulting plot will falsely infer a much larger effective population size for the recent past than the true size for the entire species.\n\nC. The resulting plot will accurately estimate the effective population size but will incorrectly place demographic events, like population bottlenecks, much further in the past than they actually occurred.\n\nD. The resulting plot will be largely unaffected by the sampling strategy, as coalescent methods are robust to sampling from structured populations.", "solution": "Coalescent skyline plots infer a time-varying effective population size, $N_{e}(t)$, from the distribution of coalescent waiting times among sampled lineages.

Let $N_{e,\\text{local}}$ denote the local effective size of that deme and $N_{e,\\text{species}}$ the effective size relevant to the entire species. For recent times, before substantial migration or mixing of lineages across demes, coalescent events for lineages sampled within one deme occur at the within-deme rate\n$$\n\\lambda_{k}^{\\text{local}}(t) \\approx \\frac{\\binom{k}{2}}{2N_{e,\\text{local}}},\n$$\ngiving\n$$\nE[T_{k}^{\\text{recent}}] \\approx \\frac{2N_{e,\\text{local}}}{k(k-1)}.\n$$\nIf the skyline analysis incorrectly assumes panmixia for the entire species, it will attribute these short within-deme waiting times to the global $N_{e}(t)$, thereby yielding\n$$\n\\hat{N}_{e}^{\\text{recent}} \\approx N_{e,\\text{local}}.\n$$\nBecause $N_{e,\\text{local}} \\ll N_{e,\\text{species}}$ for a single small breeding ground in a very large, widespread species, the inferred recent effective size will be systematically biased downward relative to the true effective size of the entire species.\n\nBy contrast, asserting a larger recent $N_{e}$ (option B) contradicts the fact that within-deme coalescence is faster (smaller waiting times imply smaller $N_{e}$). Claiming accurate $N_{e}$ but shifted timing (option C) is incorrect because the primary effect here is a magnitude bias in recent $N_{e}$. Finally, robustness to sampling from structured populations (option D) is not a property of standard skyline methods; under structure, skyline plots reflect the inverse instantaneous coalescence rate, which depends on sampling scheme and can markedly deviate from the true species-wide $N_{e}(t)$.\n\nTherefore, the most likely systematic bias is an underestimate of recent effective population size relative to the true species-wide history.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1964782"}]}
