The team's goal is to sequence a specific 150 base-pair segment of a mitochondrial gene to study its phylogenetic relationship with modern sloths.

Modern DNA is ubiquitous and can easily infiltrate experiments, leading to baffling or misleading results if not rigorously controlled. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1908410] challenges you to think like a scientist on the front lines of aDNA authentication, weighing evidence and applying parsimony to solve a puzzle, a critical skill in this field.", "problem": "A team of paleogeneticists is investigating a securely dated and undisturbed burial chamber from a Bronze Age settlement in Northern Europe (circa 1500 BCE). They extract soil samples from a sealed sarcophagus for environmental ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis, a technique used to identify organisms from trace amounts of genetic material left in the environment. The laboratory conducting the analysis adheres to the strictest protocols to prevent contamination. Despite these precautions, the sequencing results show several high-quality DNA reads that unambiguously match the reference genome of the common potato, *Solanum tuberosum*. This finding is perplexing, as the potato was domesticated in the Andes region of South America and historical records confirm its introduction to Europe only after 1492 CE.\n\nGiven this anachronistic finding, which of the following represents the most probable scientific explanation?\n\nA. The finding provides strong evidence for previously unknown trans-Atlantic trade and contact between South America and Bronze Age Europe.\n\nB. The ancient samples were contaminated with modern *Solanum tuberosum* DNA at some point during collection, processing, or analysis.\n\nC. The recovered DNA fragments are not from *Solanum tuberosum* but from a closely related native European plant from the same family (Solanaceae), such as *Solanum nigrum* (Black Nightshade), and were misidentified by the alignment software.\n\nD. The accepted radiocarbon dating for the Bronze Age site is incorrect, and the burial must actually date to the 16th century CE or later.\n\nE. The DNA fragments originated from a common soil bacterium that had incorporated genes from a wild *Solanum* species via horizontal gene transfer millions of years ago.", "solution": "We begin by evaluating the plausibility of each proposed explanation using standard reasoning about prior probabilities, known historical constraints, and characteristic features of ancient DNA data.\n\nFirst, the prior probability that domesticated potato, Solanum tuberosum, was present in Northern Europe circa 1500 BCE is extremely low given convergent evidence from archaeobotany, historical records, and biogeography showing domestication in the Andes and introduction to Europe only after 1492 CE. An extraordinary claim such as previously unknown Bronze Age trans-Atlantic contact leading to the presence of potato would require multiple independent, convergent lines of evidence (e.g., macroremains, starch grains with diagnostic morphology, residue analysis, iconography, direct radiocarbon dates on plant remains, and consistent aDNA signals across contexts). A small number of DNA reads alone do not satisfy this standard. Therefore, option A is highly improbable given current knowledge and the limited nature of the evidence presented.\n\nSecond, contamination is a well-documented and common issue in ancient DNA workflows, even under strict protocols. Environmental aDNA samples are particularly susceptible because:\n- Soil matrices can carry modern DNA introduced during sampling, transport, or storage.\n- Laboratory sources such as the kitome (background DNA present in reagents), cross-sample carryover, aerosolized PCR products, and barcode/index hopping in sequencing libraries can contribute exogenous reads.\n- Human-associated food DNA, including from common staples like potatoes, is pervasive in modern environments; personnel and surfaces can harbor trace plant DNA.\n- Modern contamination typically produces higher-quality, longer, less-damaged reads lacking characteristic aDNA damage patterns (e.g., cytosine deamination causing C to T substitutions at molecule ends) and may appear as a small subset in otherwise authentic datasets.\n\nGiven these considerations, contamination at some stage of collection, processing, or analysis is the most parsimonious and empirically common explanation. This directly supports option B.\n\nThird, misidentification due to alignment to a closely related European Solanum species (option C) is less likely given the statement that the reads unambiguously match the Solanum tuberosum reference genome. While misclassification can occur when using permissive mapping parameters or incomplete references, a set of high-quality reads that uniquely map with species-specific markers to Solanum tuberosum reduces the plausibility of this explanation relative to contamination. Moreover, if the reads truly carry diagnostic variants of domesticated potato across multiple loci, contamination remains a simpler explanation than convergent similarity or cross-species misalignment.\n\nFourth, the hypothesis that the site dating is incorrect (option D) would require that a securely dated, undisturbed Bronze Age burial actually be younger than 1492 CE. Radiocarbon dating, stratigraphic integrity, and typological corroboration together make such a large chronological displacement extremely unlikely. A global redating of the burial by roughly three millennia based on a few DNA reads contradicts the weight of independent chronological evidence and is not a proportionate inference.\n\nFifth, the horizontal gene transfer hypothesis (option E) posits that bacterial DNA carrying plant genes caused the matches. Cross-kingdom horizontal gene transfer of nuclear plant genes into bacteria is rare, and sequences transferred millions of years ago would be highly diverged, making multiple unambiguous high-identity alignments to the modern Solanum tuberosum nuclear reference genome unlikely. Furthermore, bacterial DNA would exhibit bacterial genomic context and features, not eukaryotic intron-exon structures, and would not plausibly yield several high-quality reads indistinguishable from modern potato DNA.\n\nAdditional methodological considerations also favor contamination:\n- Authentic ancient DNA typically shows short fragment lengths and terminal damage patterns; absence of these patterns in the Solanum tuberosum reads would strongly indicate modern origin.\n- Replication in independent laboratories, negative controls, and damage-aware authentication models are required before accepting unexpected taxonomic assignments in ancient samples.\n\nSynthesizing these points, the most probable scientific explanation, consistent with known failure modes in aDNA workflows and with the minimal evidentiary weight of a few high-quality reads, is modern contamination with Solanum tuberosum DNA. Therefore, option B is the best answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1908410"}, {"introduction": "Once authenticated ancient DNA is sequenced, it provides a direct window into the past, allowing us to place extinct species and populations onto the tree of life. However, interpreting these phylogenetic trees requires care, as samples from different time points—known as heterochronous data—introduce unique features. This exercise [@problem_id:1908395] addresses a common conceptual hurdle by explaining why a branch leading to an ancient sample is shorter than one leading to its modern relative, connecting the visual representation of a tree to the fundamental process of mutation accumulation over time.", "problem": "In the field of paleogenomics, scientists construct phylogenetic trees to understand the evolutionary relationships between ancient and modern organisms. Imagine a phylogenetic tree is built using mitochondrial DNA sequences from three sources: a hypothetical most recent common ancestor (MRCA), a 30,000-year-old archaic hominin fossil, and a present-day modern human.\n\nIn such a tree, the \"tips\" represent the individual samples (the ancient hominin and the modern human), and the branches connect these tips back to their MRCA. The length of each branch is directly proportional to the number of genetic substitutions (mutations) estimated to have occurred along that specific lineage.\n\nWhen observing the resulting tree, a student notes that the branch leading from the MRCA to the 30,000-year-old hominin tip is visibly shorter than the branch leading from the MRCA to the modern human tip.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental evolutionary explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The modern human lineage experienced a higher mutation rate due to greater exposure to mutagens in the recent environment.\n\nB. The ancient hominin's lineage existed for a shorter period of time between the divergence from the MRCA and the point of sampling (its death 30,000 years ago), allowing for fewer mutations to accumulate compared to the modern human lineage, which continued to the present day.\n\nC. Technical artifacts during the sequencing of the degraded ancient DNA lead to an underestimation of the true number of mutations, artificially shortening the branch.\n\nD. The process of natural selection was stronger on the ancient hominin lineage, purging most new mutations and thus reducing the rate of substitution observed.\n\nE. The most recent common ancestor was genetically more similar to the ancient hominin than to the modern human, meaning fewer changes were needed to produce the ancient lineage.", "solution": "Branch lengths in a time-calibrated phylogeny scaled by substitutions reflect the integral of the lineage-specific substitution rate over the time from the MRCA to the sampling time of each tip. If $r$ denotes the per-lineage substitution rate (assumed constant under a molecular clock), and $t$ denotes elapsed time along a branch from the MRCA to the tip’s sampling time, then the expected number of substitutions (and thus expected branch length) is\n$$\nE[L]=r\\,t.\n$$\nLet $t_{M}$ be the elapsed time from the MRCA to the modern human sampled at the present, and let $t_{A}$ be the elapsed time from the MRCA to the ancient hominin sampled $\\Delta t>0$ earlier than the present. Then\n$$\nt_{A}=t_{M}-\\Delta t,\n$$\nwhich implies\n$$\nE[L_{A}]=r\\,t_{A}=r\\,(t_{M}-\\Delta t)=r\\,t_{M}-r\\,\\Delta t<E[L_{M}]=r\\,t_{M},\n$$\nsince $r>0$ and $\\Delta t>0$. Therefore, under the fundamental molecular clock expectation that substitutions accumulate proportionally to elapsed time, the branch to the ancient hominin is shorter simply because less time elapsed between the MRCA and the sampling of that lineage.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A invokes lineage-specific rate acceleration due to environmental mutagens; such rate variation is not required and is less parsimonious than the time-of-sampling explanation.\n- B states exactly the time-elapsed rationale derived above and is the fundamental evolutionary explanation under a molecular clock.\n- C posits a technical artifact; while possible in practice, it is not an evolutionary explanation and is not the most fundamental reason for the observed pattern.\n- D appeals to stronger selection reducing substitutions; however, genome-wide mitochondrial substitutions are largely neutral or nearly neutral, and under neutral theory the substitution rate equals the mutation rate, making time since divergence the primary determinant absent evidence of sustained rate differences.\n- E misconstrues the MRCA’s relation to descendants; differences in branch length arise from elapsed time and rate, not an intrinsic greater similarity of the MRCA to one descendant.\n\nThus, B is the most accurate and fundamental evolutionary explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1908395"}]}
