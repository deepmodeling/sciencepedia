This exercise [@problem_id:1932150] explores the most common reason for this discordance: incomplete lineage sorting. By considering the well-known case of human-chimpanzee divergence, you will develop a crucial intuition for how genetic variation in an ancestral population can lead to gene histories that are older than the speciation events themselves.", "problem": "In molecular phylogenetics, a \"species tree\" illustrates the evolutionary divergence of species, while a \"gene tree\" traces the ancestry of a particular gene. The speciation event that separated the lineages leading to modern humans (Homo sapiens) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) is robustly dated to approximately 6 million years ago (mya). However, when studying a specific homologous gene, let's call it Gene Z, researchers calculate its coalescence time to be approximately 10 mya. The coalescence time is defined as the time in the past when the specific gene copies sampled from the two species trace back to a single common ancestral gene copy.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most scientifically accepted explanation for the observation that the gene's coalescence time (10 mya) is significantly older than the species divergence time (6 mya)?\n\nA. The gene was transferred horizontally into the human or chimpanzee lineage from a much older, now-extinct primate species after the initial split.\n\nB. The dating of the human-chimpanzee speciation event at 6 mya is likely incorrect, and the true divergence must have occurred at least 10 mya.\n\nC. The common ancestral species of humans and chimpanzees was genetically polymorphic for Gene Z, and the specific gene variants that became fixed in each lineage had already diverged from each other within that ancestral population long before the speciation event occurred.\n\nD. The molecular clock for Gene Z is not constant; the gene has mutated at a much slower rate than average, making its divergence appear older than it actually is.\n\nE. After the initial speciation event at 6 mya, there was a period of hybridization between the early human and chimpanzee lineages, which reintroduced a more ancient version of Gene Z into one of the populations.", "solution": "The core of this problem lies in understanding the distinction between the divergence of species and the divergence of genes, a concept known as incomplete lineage sorting or deep coalescence.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Concepts**:\n    *   **Species Tree**: Represents the history of speciation events. In this case, there was a single ancestral population that split into two separate lineages (one leading to humans, one to chimpanzees) at a specific point in time, 6 mya. This point is the speciation event.\n    *   **Gene Tree**: Represents the history of a specific segment of DNA (a gene). The history of the gene is not necessarily the same as the history of the species that carries it.\n    *   **Ancestral Polymorphism**: An ancestral population is not a group of genetically identical individuals. It contains genetic variation, meaning multiple different versions (alleles) of a gene can coexist at the same time.\n\n2.  **The Process of Coalescence**:\n    *   When we trace the ancestry of a gene from two different species (like a human and a chimpanzee gene copy), we are looking for their Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) at the genetic level. The time to this MRCA is the coalescence time.\n    *   The speciation event at 6 mya was a population-level split. At that time, the ancestral population already contained different alleles of Gene Z. Let's say alleles Z1 and Z2 were present. The common ancestor of Z1 and Z2 may have lived much earlier, for instance, at 10 mya.\n    *   Following the species split, by random genetic drift, the lineage leading to humans might have lost the Z2 allele, fixing Z1. Conversely, the lineage leading to chimpanzees might have lost the Z1 allele, fixing Z2.\n    *   Therefore, when we compare the modern human Gene Z (descended from Z1) and the modern chimpanzee Gene Z (descended from Z2), their common ancestor is the original gene that existed 10 mya, well before the species themselves split at 6 mya. This discrepancy between the gene tree and the species tree is called \"deep coalescence\" or \"incomplete lineage sorting.\"\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   **A. Horizontal Gene Transfer**: While a real phenomenon, horizontal gene transfer between complex vertebrates is extremely rare and not the standard explanation for such a common pattern observed in primate genomes. Deep coalescence is a much more parsimonious and expected explanation based on population genetics.\n    *   **B. Dating Error**: The problem asks for an explanation of the phenomenon *given the data*. Questioning the validity of well-established data (like the human-chimp split) is not a valid scientific explanation for the discrepancy; it's a rejection of the premise.\n    *   **C. Ancestral Polymorphism**: This option correctly describes the mechanism of deep coalescence. The ancestral population had pre-existing genetic diversity (polymorphism) for Gene Z. The divergence of these gene variants predates the divergence of the species, and the two new species simply inherited different, already-diverged versions of the gene. This is the most accepted scientific explanation.\n    *   **D. Mutation Rate Variation**: The molecular clock uses mutation rates to *estimate* the time of divergence. A slower rate would make a divergence of a fixed age appear to have *fewer* mutations, which would be interpreted as *younger*, not older. This option misinterprets the relationship between mutation rate and estimated time. The coalescence time is a historical event, not an artifact of mutation rate.\n    *   **E. Hybridization**: Post-speciation hybridization and gene flow (introgression) can occur. However, deep coalescence due to ancestral polymorphism is a more direct and common consequence of population genetics that doesn't require a secondary event like hybridization to explain the pattern. It is the default and most parsimonious explanation for a gene tree being older than a species tree in closely related species.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that the divergence of the gene alleles happened in the polymorphic ancestral population before that population split into two distinct species.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1932150"}, {"introduction": "While conceptual understanding is key, evolutionary biology is a quantitative science where the occurrence of incomplete lineage sorting is a predictable phenomenon governed by population size and time. This phenomenon can be modeled using coalescent theory to make precise predictions about evolutionary outcomes.

The speciation event separating the ancestor of T and S from the lineage leading to U occurred $T_{root} = 800,000$ generations ago. The subsequent speciation event that split the common ancestor of T and S into the two distinct species occurred $T_{split} = 600,000$ generations ago.\n\nBased on fossil records and population genetic analyses, the effective population size, $N_e$, of both relevant ancestral species is estimated to have been constant at $N_e = 100,000$ individuals. A researcher samples a single allele of a neutrally evolving nuclear gene from one individual of each of the three species. Assuming the population follows the principles of the Wright-Fisher model of genetic drift, calculate the probability that the specific allele sampled from species T is genealogically most closely related to the allele sampled from species U, rather than to the allele from its sister species S.\n\nGive your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We model the sampled neutral nuclear gene under the Wrightâ€“Fisher model via the standard Kingman coalescent. For an autosomal nuclear locus in a diploid population of effective size $N_{e}$, the coalescence rate for a pair of lineages is $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2 N_{e}}$ per generation.

While incomplete lineage sorting provides a baseline expectation for discordance, other events like ancient hybridization and gene flow (introgression) can create distinct signatures in the genome. This advanced practice problem [@problem_id:1932149] challenges you to act like a phylogenomicist, using gene tree frequencies to disentangle the effects of ILS and introgression to quantify the impact of a past hybridization event.", "problem": "In phylogenetics, it is common to observe that the evolutionary history of a single gene (a gene tree) differs from the evolutionary history of the species from which it was sampled (the species tree). One major cause of this discordance is Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS). Consider three species, A, B, and C, with the established species tree topology of ((A,B),C), meaning A and B are sister species. The time between the two speciation events, measured in coalescent units, is given by the internal branch length $T = \\ln(3)$.\n\nUnder the standard multispecies coalescent model, the probabilities of recovering the three possible unrooted gene tree topologies are determined by $T$. The probability of the congruent topology, ((A,B),C), is $P_1 = 1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\exp(-T)$, while the probabilities of the two discordant topologies, (A,(B,C)) and (B,(A,C)), are equal: $P_2 = P_3 = \\frac{1}{3}\\exp(-T)$.\n\nA large-scale phylogenomic study reveals an unexpected pattern. While pure ILS predicts equal frequencies for the two discordant topologies, the observed frequencies are asymmetric. For the topology ((A,B),C), the observed frequency is $133/180$. For (A,(B,C)), the frequency is $7/45$. For (B,(A,C)), the frequency is $19/180$.\n\nThis asymmetry suggests an alternative evolutionary process: ancient gene flow (introgression). A proposed model posits that after species B diverged from A, there was a period of hybridization allowing genes from the lineage leading to species C to introgress into the gene pool of the lineage leading to species B. This process affected a fraction, $\\gamma$, of the genome of species B. For any gene affected by this introgression event, its true phylogenetic history is (A,(B,C)). The remaining fraction of the genome, $1-\\gamma$, evolves according to the standard species tree ((A,B),C) and is subject to ILS.\n\nBased on the provided model and the observed gene tree frequencies, calculate the value of $\\gamma$, the fraction of the genome affected by introgression. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the introgression fraction, $\\gamma$, based on a mixture model of Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS) and introgression. We are given the species tree ((A,B),C), the internal branch length $T = \\ln(3)$, and the observed frequencies of the three possible gene tree topologies.\n\nLet's denote the three gene tree topologies as follows:\n-   $T_1$: The congruent topology ((A,B),C).\n-   $T_2$: The discordant topology (A,(B,C)).\n-   $T_3$: The discordant topology (B,(A,C)).\n\nThe observed frequencies are given as:\n-   $f(T_1) = 133/180$\n-   $f(T_2) = 7/45$\n-   $f(T_3) = 19/180$\n\nThe model states that a fraction $(1-\\gamma)$ of the genome follows the species tree ((A,B),C) and is subject to ILS, while a fraction $\\gamma$ has a history defined by introgression from C to B, resulting in the topology (A,(B,C)). We can write the expected observed frequency of each topology as a weighted sum of probabilities from these two genomic fractions.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probabilities of each topology under pure ILS, given $T = \\ln(3)$.\nThe probability of the congruent topology $T_1$ under ILS is:\n$P_{ILS}(T_1) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\exp(-T) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\exp(-\\ln(3)) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{7}{9}$.\n\nThe probability of each discordant topology ($T_2$ and $T_3$) under ILS is:\n$P_{ILS}(T_2) = P_{ILS}(T_3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\exp(-T) = \\frac{1}{3}\\exp(-\\ln(3)) = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\nNow, let's construct the equations for the observed frequencies based on the mixture model:\n\nFor topology $T_1$ ((A,B),C):\nThis topology can only arise from the non-introgressed part of the genome $(1-\\gamma)$. The introgressed part has a history of (A,(B,C)) and thus cannot produce $T_1$.\n$f(T_1) = (1-\\gamma) \\times P_{ILS}(T_1) + \\gamma \\times 0 = (1-\\gamma) \\frac{7}{9}$.\n\nFor topology $T_2$ (A,(B,C)):\nThis topology can arise from two sources:\n1.  From the non-introgressed part $(1-\\gamma)$ via ILS, with probability $P_{ILS}(T_2) = 1/9$.\n2.  From the introgressed part $(\\gamma)$, for which this topology is the defined history, so the probability is 1.\n$f(T_2) = (1-\\gamma) \\times P_{ILS}(T_2) + \\gamma \\times 1 = (1-\\gamma) \\frac{1}{9} + \\gamma$.\n\nFor topology $T_3$ (B,(A,C)):\nThis topology can only arise from the non-introgressed part of the genome $(1-\\gamma)$ via ILS. The introgression from C to B does not create this topology.\n$f(T_3) = (1-\\gamma) \\times P_{ILS}(T_3) + \\gamma \\times 0 = (1-\\gamma) \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\nWe have a system of three equations. The key insight is that the frequencies of the two discordant topologies, $f(T_2)$ and $f(T_3)$, differ only by the term $\\gamma$. In a pure ILS scenario ($\\gamma=0$), we would have $f(T_2) = f(T_3)$. The excess frequency of $T_2$ over $T_3$ is therefore a direct measure of the introgression fraction $\\gamma$.\n\nLet's subtract the equation for $f(T_3)$ from the equation for $f(T_2)$:\n$f(T_2) - f(T_3) = \\left( (1-\\gamma) \\frac{1}{9} + \\gamma \\right) - \\left( (1-\\gamma) \\frac{1}{9} \\right)$\n$f(T_2) - f(T_3) = \\gamma$\n\nNow we can substitute the given observed frequencies to find $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = f(T_2) - f(T_3) = \\frac{7}{45} - \\frac{19}{180}$\n\nTo subtract the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 180.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{7 \\times 4}{45 \\times 4} - \\frac{19}{180} = \\frac{28}{180} - \\frac{19}{180} = \\frac{28 - 19}{180} = \\frac{9}{180}$\n\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{20}$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$\\gamma = 0.05$\n\nTo express this with three significant figures, we write it as $0.0500$.\n\nAlternatively, one could use the equation for $f(T_3)$ to solve for $\\gamma$:\n$f(T_3) = (1-\\gamma) \\frac{1}{9}$\n$\\frac{19}{180} = (1-\\gamma) \\frac{1}{9}$\n$1-\\gamma = \\frac{19}{180} \\times 9 = \\frac{19}{20}$\n$\\gamma = 1 - \\frac{19}{20} = \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05$.\nThis confirms our result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0500}$$", "id": "1932149"}]}
