A fourth, more ancient species, *Protospecies antiqua*, is used as the outgroup. The analysis is based on five distinct morphological and physiological characters. For each character, the ancestral state is coded as `0` and the derived state is coded as `1`. The biologist has determined that the outgroup, *Protospecies antiqua*, exhibits the ancestral state for all five characters.\n\nThe character data for the four species are as follows:\n\n-   **Species 1:** *Protospecies antiqua* (Outgroup) - Character states: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n-   **Species 2:** *Glimmerwing splendens* - Character states: `1, 0, 1, 0, 0`\n-   **Species 3:** *Stonehide robustus* - Character states: `1, 1, 0, 1, 0`\n-   **Species 4:** *Shadowstalker agilis* - Character states: `1, 1, 0, 0, 1`\n\nThe characters are listed in order:\n1.
