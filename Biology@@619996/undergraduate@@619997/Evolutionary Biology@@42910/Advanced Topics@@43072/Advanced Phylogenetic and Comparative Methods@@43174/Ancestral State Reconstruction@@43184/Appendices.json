The evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) among five extant species are described as follows: *Glimmerwing* and *Shadowspinner* are sister species (they share a most recent common ancestor). This pair's closest relative is the species *Stonemantle*. A different pair of sister species, *Sunstreaker* and *Duskdiver*, form a separate distinct clade. The clade containing *Glimmerwing*, *Shadowspinner*, and *Stonemantle* and the clade containing *Sunstreaker* and *Duskdiver* are themselves sister groups, originating from the single common ancestor of all five species.\n\nA key trait under investigation is the feeding behavior of larvae, which can be one of two states: 'feeder' (larvae actively consume food) or 'non-feeder' (larvae develop entirely on yolk reserves from the egg). The observed states in the five living species are:\n- *Glimmerwing*: Feeder\n- *Shadowspinner*: Feeder\n- *Stonemantle*: Non-feeder\n- *Sunstreaker*: Feeder\n- *Duskdiver*: Non-feeder\n\nAssuming the common ancestor of all five species was a 'non-feeder', determine the minimum number of evolutionary changes (i.e., transitions between 'feeder' and 'non-feeder' states) required to explain this distribution of traits on the phylogeny. This value is known as the total parsimony score.", "solution": "Let the two larval states be denoted by symbols $F$ (feeder) and $N$ (non-feeder).

The model assumes that on any given branch of the phylogeny, the probability of the trait changing from Herding to Non-herding (a loss event) is $p_{\\text{H}\\to\\text{N}} = 0.3$, and the probability of it changing from Non-herding to Herding (a gain event) is $p_{\\text{N}\\to\\text{H}} = 0.1$.
