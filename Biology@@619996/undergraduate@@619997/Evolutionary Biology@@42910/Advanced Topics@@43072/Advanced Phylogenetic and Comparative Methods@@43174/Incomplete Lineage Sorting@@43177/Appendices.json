While a species tree represents the evolutionary path of species, individual genes within those species have their own evolutionary histories, called gene trees. This practice [@problem_id:1940289] will help you solidify the fundamental distinction between concordant trees, which match the species phylogeny, and discordant trees, which do not.", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, the evolutionary history of a group of species is represented by a species tree. However, the evolutionary history of an individual gene, known as a gene tree, may not always match the species tree. When a gene tree's topology differs from the species tree's topology, it is called \"discordant.\" A primary cause for this is a process called Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS), which describes the failure of gene copies (alleles) to coalesce in the most recent common ancestral population of the species, leading to a gene history that conflicts with the species' history. When a gene tree has the same topology as the species tree, it is called \"concordant.\"\n\nConsider the well-established species phylogeny for three great apes: Humans (H), Chimpanzees (C), and Gorillas (G). The species tree shows that Humans and Chimpanzees are sister taxa, with Gorillas as the outgroup. This relationship is represented by the parenthetical notation ((H, C), G).\n\nA genomic analysis of a particular gene across these three species reveals that there are three possible topological relationships for its gene tree:\n\n*   **Gene Tree 1:** A tree where the human and chimpanzee gene lineages are most closely related: ((H, C), G).\n*   **Gene Tree 2:** A tree where the human and gorilla gene lineages are most closely related: ((H, G), C).\n*   **Gene Tree 3:** A tree where the chimpanzee and gorilla gene lineages are most closely related: ((C, G), H).\n\nBased on the definitions of concordance and discordance, which of the following statements correctly categorizes all three possible gene trees relative to the known species tree?\n\nA.

All three gene trees are concordant because they are all biologically possible.\n\nF. All three gene trees are discordant because gene trees and species trees are fundamentally different concepts.", "solution": "We are given a known species tree for three taxa: Humans (H), Chimpanzees (C), and Gorillas (G), with topology $((H, C), G)$. By definition, a gene tree is concordant if and only if its topology is identical to the species tree, and discordant otherwise. Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS) is a known mechanism that can cause discordance, but the criterion for concordance/discordance is strictly topological equality or inequality to the species tree.\n\nEvaluate each gene tree against the species tree:\n\n1. Gene Tree 1: $((H, C), G)$. This is exactly the same topology as the species tree $((H, C), G)$, so it is concordant by definition.\n2. Gene Tree 2: $((H, G), C)$. This topology differs from $((H, C), G)$, so it is discordant by definition.\n3. Gene Tree 3: $((C, G), H)$. This topology also differs from $((H, C), G)$, so it is discordant by definition.\n\nTherefore, the correct categorization is: Concordant: 1; Discordant: 2, 3, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1940289"}, {"introduction": "Now that you can identify discordant gene trees, the next step is to quantify when they are likely to occur. The multispecies coalescent model provides a powerful formula to predict the probability of ILS based on key evolutionary parameters.

This incongruence is more likely to occur when speciation events happen in rapid succession, leaving insufficient time for gene lineages to sort into reciprocally monophyletic groups.\n\nConsider three closely related species: A, B, and C. The species phylogeny indicates that A and B are sister species, having diverged from a common ancestor more recently than their split from species C. The probability of observing a gene tree that conflicts with this species tree due to ILS can be modeled using the coalescent framework. For a symmetric three-taxon tree, this probability is given by the expression:\n$$P(\\text{ILS}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2N_e}\\right)$$\nHere, $T$ represents the time interval, measured in generations, between the first speciation event (the split of the ancestor of A and B from the lineage leading to C) and the second speciation event (the split of A from B). The parameter $N_e$ is the effective population size of the ancestral population of species A and B during this interval.\n\nSuppose an analysis of these three species reveals a particular scenario where the time interval $T$ between the two speciation events is exactly equal to the effective population size $N_e$ of the ancestral lineage.

A key prediction of pure ILS is that both alternative discordant gene trees should occur with equal frequency. This exercise [@problem_id:1940314] simulates a real-world phylogenomic scenario where this symmetry is broken, allowing you to use the ILS model to quantify the signal of another important evolutionary process: introgression.", "problem": "In evolutionary genomics, a key challenge is to distinguish between incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and hybridization (introgression) as causes for gene trees that are discordant with the species tree. Consider three closely related species of songbirds: the Common Redpoll (*Acanthis flammea*), the Arctic Redpoll (*Acanthis hornemanni*), and the White-winged Crossbill (*Loxia leucoptera*). The established species tree indicates that the two redpoll species are sisters, having diverged from a common ancestor more recently than their shared lineage diverged from the crossbill. We can represent this species tree as `((A. flammea, A. hornemanni), L. leucoptera)`.\n\nThe divergence between *A. flammea* and *A. hornemanni* occurred $T_1 = 1.50$ million years ago. The divergence of their common ancestor from the *L. leucoptera* lineage occurred $T_2 = 6.00$ million years ago. The constant effective population size of the ancestral redpoll population (the population that existed between times $T_2$ and $T_1$) is estimated to be $N_e = 150,000$ individuals. The generation time for all species is $g = 2$ years.\n\nUnder a model of pure ILS, the probability of obtaining one of the two specific discordant gene tree topologies is given by $P_{\\text{discordant}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\text{branch}}}{2 N_e g}\\right)$, where $T_{\\text{branch}}$ is the duration of the internal branch of the species tree during which ILS can occur.\n\nA recent phylogenomic study analyzed 10,000 independent gene loci from the three species and found the following counts for the three possible unrooted topologies:\n- Loci supporting `((A. flammea, A. hornemanni), L. leucoptera)`: 8500\n- Loci supporting `((A. flammea, L. leucoptera), A. hornemanni)`: 700\n- Loci supporting `((A. hornemanni, L. leucoptera), A. flammea)`: 800\n\nThe significant asymmetry in the counts of the two discordant topologies (700 vs. 800) suggests that introgression may have occurred between the crossbill and one of the redpoll species. To quantify the impact of this putative introgression, calculate the \"Introgression Enhancement Factor\". This factor is defined as the ratio of the observed number of `((A. hornemanni, L. leucoptera), A. flammea)` topologies to the number that would be theoretically expected for this topology under a pure ILS model.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The internal branch of the species tree over which incomplete lineage sorting can produce discordant topologies has duration $T_{\\text{branch}} = T_{2} - T_{1}$.
