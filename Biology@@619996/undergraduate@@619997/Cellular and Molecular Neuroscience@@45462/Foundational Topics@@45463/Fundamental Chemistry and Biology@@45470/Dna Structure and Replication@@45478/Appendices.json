This thought experiment probes your understanding of the replication fork by asking you to predict the consequences of inhibiting a crucial enzyme, DNA ligase. By analyzing this hypothetical scenario, you will solidify your knowledge of the continuous synthesis of the leading strand versus the fragmented synthesis of the lagging strand and the formation of Okazaki fragments. [@problem_id:2334427]", "problem": "A developmental neurobiologist is studying a rapidly dividing neuroblastoma cell line.

The parental DNA double helix will be unable to unwind, preventing the formation of a replication fork.", "solution": "The question asks to predict the state of newly synthesized DNA in cells treated with a DNA ligase inhibitor. To answer this, we must understand the distinct mechanisms of DNA synthesis on the leading and lagging strands during replication.\n\nDNA replication is semi-conservative and occurs at a replication fork where the parental double helix is unwound by DNA helicase. The two parental strands are antiparallel (one runs 5' to 3', the other 3' to 5'). DNA polymerase, the enzyme that synthesizes new DNA, can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of a growing strand, meaning synthesis always proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction.\n\nThe **leading strand** is the new strand whose template is the parental strand oriented in the 3' to 5' direction relative to the movement of the replication fork. After a single RNA primer is laid down, DNA polymerase can synthesize the leading strand continuously, moving in the same direction as the replication fork unwinds. Therefore, the leading strand is synthesized as one long, continuous molecule. Its synthesis is largely independent of DNA ligase activity, except for the eventual joining of DNA synthesized from different replication origins on a chromosome, which is a much larger-scale process. Within a single replication fork, it's continuous.\n\nThe **lagging strand** is the new strand whose template is the parental strand oriented in the 5' to 3' direction. Because DNA polymerase can only synthesize in the 5' to 3' direction, it must move away from the replication fork on this template. As the fork continues to unwind, new sections of the template are exposed. This forces the lagging strand to be synthesized discontinuously in short segments known as **Okazaki fragments**. Each fragment requires its own RNA primer to initiate synthesis.\n\nThe process for each Okazaki fragment is as follows:\n1.  Primase synthesizes a short RNA primer.\n2.  DNA polymerase III (in prokaryotes, or its equivalent in eukaryotes) extends the primer with DNA nucleotides, forming an Okazaki fragment.\n3.  DNA polymerase I (or its equivalent) removes the RNA primer from the 5' end of the previous fragment and replaces it with DNA nucleotides.\n4.  After the RNA primer is replaced, a small gap (a nick in the sugar-phosphate backbone) remains between the 3' end of the newly added DNA and the 5' end of the downstream Okazaki fragment.\n\nThis is where **DNA ligase** plays its crucial role. DNA ligase covalently joins the Okazaki fragments by forming a phosphodiester bond between the 3'-hydroxyl group of one fragment and the 5'-phosphate group of the next. This action \"seals\" the nicks in the lagging strand, creating a single, continuous DNA molecule.\n\nIn the presence of Ligatoxin, a specific inhibitor of DNA ligase, step 4 cannot occur. DNA synthesis will still proceed on both strands. The leading strand will be synthesized continuously. The lagging strand will also be synthesized, but the individual Okazaki fragments, after their RNA primers have been replaced with DNA, cannot be joined.\n\nTherefore, the newly synthesized DNA will consist of a complete and continuous leading strand and a fragmented lagging strand, with each fragment corresponding to an Okazaki fragment.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n-   **A. The newly synthesized leading strand will be a single, long polymer, while the newly synthesized lagging strand will exist as numerous short, unlinked DNA fragments.** This accurately describes the outcome of DNA ligase inhibition.\n-   **B. Both the newly synthesized leading and lagging strands will exist as a collection of short, unlinked DNA fragments.** This is incorrect because the leading strand is synthesized continuously.\n-   **C. DNA replication will fail to initiate, as the origin of replication cannot be properly formed.** This is incorrect. Initiation involves proteins like helicase and primase, not DNA ligase.\n-   **D. The newly synthesized lagging strand will be continuous but will contain segments of ribonucleotides (RNA) that have not been replaced with deoxyribonucleotides (DNA).** This is incorrect. The removal of RNA primers and their replacement with DNA is carried out by the exonuclease and polymerase activities of enzymes like DNA polymerase I, not by DNA ligase. DNA ligase acts *after* the RNA primers are replaced.\n-   **E. The parental DNA double helix will be unable to unwind, preventing the formation of a replication fork.** This is incorrect. Unwinding is the function of DNA helicase.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct description of the DNA state is given in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2334427"}]}
