The hydrophobic effect is a primary driving force in this folding process, sequestering nonpolar residues into a protein's core. This problem presents a thought experiment to illustrate the critical importance of this principle, asking you to predict the structural consequences of substituting a hydrophobic core residue with a charged, hydrophilic one. [@problem_id:2192847]", "problem": "A naturally occurring globular enzyme, \"Synthase-G,\" functions optimally in the aqueous environment of the cell cytoplasm at a physiological pH of 7.4. X-ray crystallography studies have revealed that its stable, folded tertiary structure is maintained by a densely packed hydrophobic core. A specific leucine residue at position 92 (Leu92) is located deep within this nonpolar core, far from the protein's surface. A researcher introduces a point mutation into the gene for Synthase-G, causing the leucine residue at position 92 to be replaced by an arginine residue. Assuming no other changes to the protein, predict the most likely consequence of this single amino acid substitution on the tertiary structure and stability of Synthase-G.\n\nA. The protein's stability and structure will be largely unaffected, as the change of a single amino acid out of hundreds is a very minor modification.\n\nB. The substitution will lead to a more compact and stable tertiary structure, as the larger arginine side chain will fill empty space within the hydrophobic core, increasing packing efficiency.\n\nC. The positively charged arginine residue will form a new, stabilizing salt bridge with a nearby acidic residue inside the core, significantly increasing the protein's stability.\n\nD. The introduction of the charged, hydrophilic arginine residue into the nonpolar core is highly unfavorable and will likely lead to significant destabilization and misfolding of the protein.\n\nE. The overall charge of the protein will change, but its three-dimensional fold and stability will remain identical to the original protein because the primary structure change is localized.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the effect of substituting a leucine residue with an arginine residue within the hydrophobic core of a globular protein. To solve this, we must analyze the properties of the amino acids involved and the environment in which the substitution occurs.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the environment and the original residue.\nThe protein is a globular enzyme in an aqueous solution. This type of protein typically folds to bury its hydrophobic (nonpolar) amino acid side chains in a core, away from the surrounding water, while exposing its hydrophilic (polar) side chains on the surface. This phenomenon, driven by the increase in entropy of the water molecules, is known as the hydrophobic effect and is a primary driver of protein folding and stability. The original residue at position 92 is leucine. The side chain of leucine is $\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH(CH}_3)_2$, which is nonpolar and hydrophobic. Its presence deep within the core is energetically favorable and contributes to the stability of the protein's native tertiary structure through hydrophobic interactions.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the new residue.\nThe new residue is arginine. The side chain of arginine is $\\text{-(CH}_2)_3\\text{-NH-C}(=\\text{NH}_2^+)\\text{-NH}_2$. This side chain contains a guanidinium group, which is protonated and carries a positive charge at physiological pH (pKa of the guanidinium group is ~12.5). Therefore, arginine is a large, bulky, positively charged, and strongly hydrophilic amino acid.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the consequence of the substitution.\nThe mutation replaces a nonpolar, hydrophobic residue (leucine) with a large, charged, hydrophilic residue (arginine) inside a nonpolar, hydrophobic environment (the core). Placing a charged group into a nonpolar medium is extremely thermodynamically unfavorable. This is due to the large desolvation energy penalty required to remove the charged arginine side chain from the aqueous environment (where it is stabilized by interactions with polar water molecules) and bury it in the low-dielectric environment of the hydrophobic core.\n\nStep 4: Predict the structural outcome.\nThe immense energetic cost of burying the arginine charge will disrupt the delicate balance of forces that maintain the protein's tertiary structure. The hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the core will be perturbed. To minimize the free energy of the system, the protein structure will likely undergo a major conformational change to expose the new arginine residue to the aqueous solvent on the protein's surface. This process involves the partial or complete unfolding of the protein, leading to a loss of its specific three-dimensional structure and function. This is a significant destabilization event, often termed misfolding.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\nA. This is incorrect. While it is a single amino acid change, the *location* and *chemical nature* of the change are critically important. A non-conservative substitution in a sensitive region like the hydrophobic core has major consequences.\nB. This is incorrect. While arginine is larger than leucine, its defining characteristic in this context is its charge and hydrophilicity, not its size. Its presence would disrupt, not strengthen, the hydrophobic interactions that hold the core together.\nC. This is incorrect. While arginine can form salt bridges, doing so would require a conveniently located acidic (negatively charged) residue also buried in the core. Burying a pair of charges (an ion pair) in a low-dielectric medium is still energetically costly, though less so than burying a single charge. However, the probability of such an optimal arrangement existing is low, and even if it did, this stabilizing interaction would be highly unlikely to overcome the massive destabilizing effect of desolvating the arginine residue in the first place. Destabilization is the far more probable outcome.\nD. This is correct. It accurately describes the thermodynamic incompatibility of placing a charged, hydrophilic group into a nonpolar environment, correctly predicting significant destabilization and misfolding as the most likely consequence.\nE. This is incorrect. A change in the primary structure at a critical location directly impacts the higher-order structures (tertiary and quaternary).

Therefore, there is a disulfide-linked subassembly of mass $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$.\n\nIn SDS-PAGE with BME, two bands at $60\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ and $40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ appear. The only change from the nonreducing condition is the reduction of disulfide bonds; therefore, the $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ disulfide-linked unit must be composed of one $60\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ polypeptide and one $40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ polypeptide linked by at least one disulfide bond.
