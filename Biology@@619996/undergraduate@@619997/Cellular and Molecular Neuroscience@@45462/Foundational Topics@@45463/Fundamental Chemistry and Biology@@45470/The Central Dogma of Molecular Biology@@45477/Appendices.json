They have isolated a gene, which they call `pyroZ`, that codes for a key metabolic enzyme. The sequence of the non-template (coding) strand of the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) at the beginning of the `pyroZ` gene's coding sequence is:\n\n`5'-ATG GCT CGA TTC GAG...-3'`\n\nThe codon `ATG` serves as the start codon.

Translation initiates at the start codon and proceeds in non-overlapping triplets, establishing the reading frame. Insertions or deletions of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three cause a frameshift, altering all downstream codons until a stop codon is encountered; insertions or deletions in multiples of three preserve the reading frame and thus insert or delete whole amino acids with the rest of the sequence unchanged.\n\nOriginal coding-strand sequence at the start of the open reading frame:\n5'-ATG GCT CGA TTC GAG ...-3'\nThis encodes the amino acid sequence:\nMet (ATG), Ala (GCT), Arg (CGA), Phe (TTC), Glu (GAG), ...\n\nMutant A inserts a single T immediately after the start codon ATG. The sequence becomes:\n5'-ATG T GCT CGA TTC GAG ...-3'\nEstablishing the reading frame from the start codon, the triplet parsing is:\nATG | TGC | TCG | ATT | CGA | G...\nThus, after Met, the codons become TGC (Cys), TCG (Ser), ATT (Ile), CGA (Arg), ... This is a one-nucleotide insertion, which shifts the reading frame starting at the second codon. Therefore, the amino acid sequence from the second position onward is extensively altered relative to the original and is likely to encounter a premature stop codon, making this highly disruptive to protein function.\n\nMutant B inserts AAA (three nucleotides) immediately after ATG. The sequence becomes:\n5'-ATG AAA GCT CGA TTC GAG ...-3'\nReading in triplets from the start codon:\nATG | AAA | GCT | CGA | TTC | GAG | ...\nThus, this introduces a Lys (AAA) immediately after Met and preserves the original reading frame thereafter. The downstream sequence (Ala-Arg-Phe-Glu-...) remains unchanged. This in-frame insertion adds a single amino acid without altering the subsequent codons, typically less disruptive than a frameshift.\n\nComparing the two:\n- Mutant A causes a frameshift with a drastically altered downstream sequence, typically more disruptive.\n- Mutant B adds one amino acid but preserves the downstream sequence.\n\nTherefore, the statement that most accurately compares the effects is that the single-nucleotide insertion in Mutant A causes a frameshift that is likely more disruptive than the in-frame three-nucleotide insertion in Mutant B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1526360"}, {"introduction": "The process of translation relies on sophisticated molecular interpreters, and the transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule is chief among them.
