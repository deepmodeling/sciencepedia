Note that this problem uses a simplified, standardized model for ATP equivalents, which is a common pedagogical approach to focus on the core concepts of the metabolic pathways.", "problem": "In a cellular neuroscience lab, researchers are comparing the energy metabolism of neurons under two different conditions. In **Condition A**, a neuron is subjected to anoxia, forcing it to rely exclusively on anaerobic glycolysis. In this process, a single molecule of glucose is converted into two molecules of lactate. In **Condition B**, a neuron undergoes complete aerobic respiration, where a single molecule of glucose is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide and water.\n\nTo standardize the calculation, you are to use the following specific energy equivalences, which represent a commonly used simplified model:\n- 1 molecule of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) entering the electron transport chain generates 3 molecules of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n- 1 molecule of Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide ($FADH_2$) entering the electron transport chain generates 2 molecules of ATP.\n- 1 molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) is considered energetically equivalent to 1 molecule of ATP.\n\nDetermine the total net yield of ATP molecules from one molecule of glucose for both Condition A and Condition B. Your answer should consist of two integer values, corresponding to Condition A and Condition B, respectively.", "solution": "We must compute the net ATP yield per glucose under the two specified conditions, using the given equivalences: each NADH that enters the electron transport chain yields 3 ATP, each $FADH_2$ yields 2 ATP, and each GTP is equivalent to 1 ATP. Substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle must also be counted explicitly.\n\nCondition A (anoxia; anaerobic glycolysis to lactate): Glycolysis converts one glucose to two pyruvate, with a net substrate-level phosphorylation of 2 ATP and production of 2 cytosolic NADH. Under anaerobic conditions, each pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase, which oxidizes NADH to $NAD^{+}$, thereby regenerating $NAD^{+}$ for continued glycolysis. Because the electron transport chain is not used in anoxia, the 2 NADH generated by glycolysis do not yield ATP via oxidative phosphorylation; instead, they are consumed in the reduction of pyruvate to lactate. The net ATP from anaerobic glycolysis per glucose is therefore\n$$\n\\text{ATP}_{\\text{Condition A}} = 2.\n$$\n\nCondition B (complete aerobic respiration to carbon dioxide and water): Tally the contributions step by step.\n\nFrom glycolysis per glucose, the net substrate-level ATP yield is\n$$\n\\text{ATP from glycolysis (substrate-level)} = 2,\n$$\nand glycolysis produces\n$$\n\\text{NADH from glycolysis} = 2.\n$$\nEach pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase, producing one NADH per pyruvate.

This problem highlights how the initial energy investment phase of glycolysis is not always fixed and connects glycolysis directly to the process of glycogenolysis.", "problem": "A neuron, to satisfy its high metabolic demands, can catabolize glucose obtained from two primary immediate sources: it can either take up free glucose from the interstitial fluid (which originates from the bloodstream) or mobilize a glucose unit from its own intracellular glycogen stores.

We must analyze how this specific enzymatic block affects the standard glycolytic pathway.\n\nFirst, let's review the two major phases of glycolysis for a single glucose molecule under normal conditions.\n\n1.  **Energy Investment Phase:**\n    This phase prepares the glucose molecule for cleavage and consumes energy.\n    - Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate, consuming 1 ATP.\n    - Fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, consuming a second ATP.\n    The total investment is 2 ATP molecules.\n    - The enzyme aldolase then cleaves the 6-carbon fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two 3-carbon molecules: one molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and one molecule of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP).\n\n2.  **Energy Payoff Phase:**\n    Under normal conditions, triose phosphate isomerase converts the DHAP into a second molecule of GAP. Thus, two molecules of GAP proceed through the payoff phase. For each molecule of GAP that is converted to pyruvate, the pathway yields 2 molecules of ATP and 1 molecule of NADH. Since two GAP molecules are processed, the total gross yield is 4 ATP and 2 NADH.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of the mutation. The inactivation of triose phosphate isomerase means that the DHAP produced from the cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate cannot be converted into GAP. The pathway for DHAP is blocked, and it can no longer be used in glycolysis.\n\nTherefore, only the single molecule of GAP that was directly formed by the aldolase reaction can proceed through the energy payoff phase.\n\nLet's recalculate the net energy yield under these new conditions:\n\n-   **Energy Investment:** The investment phase is unaffected by the mutation. It still proceeds up to the cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Thus, the energy cost remains 2 ATP.\n    - Net ATP so far = -2 ATP.\n\n-   **Energy Payoff:** Only one molecule of GAP enters this phase. The conversion of this single GAP molecule to pyruvate will produce:\n    - 2 molecules of ATP (via substrate-level phosphorylation).\n    - 1 molecule of NADH.\n\n-   **Net Yield Calculation:** We combine the investment and the payoff.\n    - **Net ATP:** (ATP produced) - (ATP consumed) = 2 ATP - 2 ATP = 0 ATP.\n    - **Net NADH:** (NADH produced) - (NADH consumed) = 1 NADH - 0 NADH = 1 NADH.\n\nSo, the overall net yield from one molecule of glucose under these conditions is 0 ATP and 1 NADH.\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\nA. 2 ATP and 2 NADH is the normal net yield.\nB. 0 ATP and 1 NADH matches our calculation.\nC. -2 ATP and 0 NADH would be the yield if the payoff phase yielded no ATP or NADH.\nD. 2 ATP and 1 NADH represents the gross ATP yield from the single GAP branch without accounting for the initial investment.\nE. 0 ATP and 0 NADH incorrectly assumes the NADH production is also blocked or balanced.\nF. 4 ATP and 2 NADH is the gross yield of normal glycolysis.\n\nThe correct answer is 0 ATP and 1 NADH.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2328611"}]}
