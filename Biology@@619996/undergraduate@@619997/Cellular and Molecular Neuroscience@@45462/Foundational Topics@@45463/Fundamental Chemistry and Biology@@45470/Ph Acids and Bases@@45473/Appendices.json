The recovery is driven by a sodium-proton exchanger (NHE) whose activity follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics.\n\nFirst, we need to establish a relationship between the activity of the NHE and the rate of change of $pH_i$. The NHE removes protons from the cell, causing $pH_i$ to increase. The flux of protons out of the cell is given by $J_{H^+}$ (moles per area per time).
