This advanced problem [@problem_id:2326894] integrates the concepts of pH, pKa, and charge states into a dynamic neuropharmacological scenario involving an irreversible inhibitor. By calculating the activity of a drug based on the protonation states of key catalytic residues, you will see how fundamental amino acid chemistry governs the efficacy of therapeutic agents at the molecular level.", "problem": "A team of neuropharmacologists is designing a next-generation therapeutic agent to irreversibly inhibit a specific neuronal receptor, NR-1, which is implicated in a neurological disorder. They start with a known competitive peptide antagonist, Pep-A, which binds reversibly to NR-1 with a dissociation constant, $K_d$. To achieve irreversible inhibition, they synthesize a new peptide, Pep-C, by substituting a single amino acid in Pep-A with a proprietary unnatural amino acid. This substitution does not alter the initial non-covalent binding affinity, so the inhibition constant for Pep-C, $K_I$, is equal to the $K_d$ of Pep-A.\n\nOnce the non-covalent complex (NR-1·Pep-C) is formed, a covalent bond is established between Pep-C and the receptor. The mechanism of covalent modification involves a Cysteine residue (Cys-100) in the binding pocket of NR-1 acting as a nucleophile. The reaction is critically dependent on a nearby Histidine residue (His-50) that functions as a general base catalyst, abstracting a proton from the Cys-100 side chain to generate the highly reactive thiolate anion. The rate of the covalent inactivation step within the NR-1·Pep-C complex is thus described by a pH-dependent first-order rate constant, $k_{inact}$. The rate of this step is limited by the proton transfer and is therefore proportional to the mole fraction of Cys-100 present in its protonated thiol form (ready to be deprotonated) and the mole fraction of His-50 present in its neutral base form (ready to accept a proton).\n\nGiven the following parameters for an experiment conducted *in vitro*:\n-   Dissociation constant of the original peptide, $K_d = 50.0 \\text{ nM}$.\n-   Side-chain pKa of the catalytic Histidine, $pK_{a,His} = 6.20$.\n-   Side-chain pKa of the nucleophilic Cysteine, $pK_{a,Cys} = 8.30$.\n-   The theoretical maximum inactivation rate constant, $k_{max}$, which would occur if both residues were in their optimal protonation states, is $0.500 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n-   The concentration of the irreversible inhibitor Pep-C used, $[I] = 150.0 \\text{ nM}$.\n-   The experiment is performed in a buffer solution maintained at a physiological pH of 7.40.\n\nAssuming the concentration of the inhibitor, $[I]$, remains constant during the experiment, calculate the half-life ($t_{1/2}$) for the population of free, active NR-1 receptors.
