By definition, the mRNA sequence is identical to the coding strand except that thymine (T) is replaced by uracil (U), and orientation remains 5' to 3'. Therefore, the corresponding mRNA is 5' - AUG UAU UUA - 3'. Using the provided table, these codons translate to AUG: Met, UAU: Tyr, UUA: Leu.\n\nNumber the DNA positions 1 through 9 across the three codons: positions 1–3 form ATG, positions 4–6 form TAT, and positions 7–9 form TTA.\n\nFor Mutation 1, position 6 (the third base of the second codon) changes from T to C. The second codon changes from TAT to TAC on the DNA coding strand, which corresponds to UAU to UAC on mRNA. From the table, UAU and UAC both encode Tyr. Thus, the amino acid is unchanged, so Mutation 1 is a silent mutation.\n\nFor Mutation 2, position 5 (the second base of the second codon) changes from A to G. The second codon changes from TAT to TGT on the DNA coding strand, which corresponds to UAU to UGU on mRNA. UGU is not among the listed stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) and is not one of the Tyr codons (UAU, UAC). Therefore, the amino acid changes to a different one, making Mutation 2 a missense mutation.\n\nFor Mutation 3, position 8 (the second base of the third codon) changes from T to G. The third codon changes from TTA to TGA on the DNA coding strand, which corresponds to UUA to UGA on mRNA. UGA is a stop codon per the table, so this introduces a premature termination codon.

By simulating a metabolic tracing experiment, you will explore the intricate metabolic partnership between neurons and astrocytes, two primary cell types in the brain. This practice requires you to predict how the carbon from glucose is partitioned among neurotransmitters, lipids, and nucleic acid precursors, and how this distribution is dramatically reorganized in response to a pathological stress like excitotoxicity. [@problem_id:2341965]", "id": "2341965", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating metabolic coupling in a co-culture system containing purified primary cortical neurons and astrocytes. The culture is supplied with glucose labeled with Carbon-13 at the first and sixth positions, denoted as $[1,6-^{13}C]$glucose. The experimental goal is to track how the carbon skeleton of glucose is differentially partitioned into three major macromolecular or derivative pools under two distinct conditions: a baseline \"resting\" state and an \"excitotoxic\" state induced by the application of a high concentration of a glutamate receptor agonist. The measured outcomes are the relative amounts of $^{13}C$ incorporated into:\n1.  The neurotransmitter pool, specifically glutamate and its derivative glutamine.\n2.  Newly synthesized fatty acids, representing the membrane lipid pool.\n3.  Ribose sugars within newly synthesized ribonucleic acid (RNA), representing the nucleic acid precursor pool.\n\nYou are provided with the following established principles of brain metabolism:\n- Astrocytes uniquely express high levels of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), an enzyme that catalyzes the anaplerotic conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, which is essential for the net synthesis of glutamate for the glutamate-glutamine cycle.\n- Neurons almost exclusively rely on pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for entry into the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle.\n- The Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), which produces ribose sugars, is significantly more active in astrocytes than in neurons under baseline conditions.\n\nBased on these principles, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the shift in the *fractional distribution* of the $^{13}C$ label derived from $[1,6-^{13}C]$glucose when the culture is shifted from the resting state to the excitotoxic state?\n\nA. Excitotoxicity will proportionally increase the rate of $^{13}C$ labeling across all three pools (neurotransmitters, lipids, and ribose) in both cell types, as overall glucose metabolism is globally upregulated to meet all cellular demands.\n\nB. In the excitotoxic state, the fractional distribution of the label will strongly shift towards the PPP and lipid synthesis pathways. This reflects an increased demand for antioxidant molecules (NADPH from the PPP) and membrane repair (lipids), leading to higher relative $^{13}C$ enrichment in ribose and fatty acids compared to the glutamate pool.\n\nC. During excitotoxicity, the fractional distribution of $^{13}C$ will be redirected primarily towards catabolic energy production. Consequently, there will be a substantial increase in the relative labeling of the glutamate/glutamine pool, coupled with a significant decrease in the relative labeling of both fatty acids and ribose sugars.\n\nD. The primary shift during excitotoxicity will be an increase in neuronal lipid synthesis to sequester excess acetyl-CoA, and an increase in astrocytic PPP activity to generate ribose for stress-related gene expression. This will lead to lower relative labeling of the glutamate/glutamine pool.\n\nE. Excitotoxicity will exclusively enhance the astrocytic PC pathway, leading to increased labeling of glutamate/glutamine, while all neuronal metabolism of the labeled glucose, including incorporation into lipids and its own glutamate pool, will cease due to metabolic failure.\n\n", "solution": "Define the fractional distributions of the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ label (normalized within the three measured pools) as $f_{\\mathrm{Glu/Gln}}$, $f_{\\mathrm{FA}}$, and $f_{\\mathrm{Ribose}}$, with the constraint\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{Glu/Gln}}+f_{\\mathrm{FA}}+f_{\\mathrm{Ribose}}=1.\n$$\nA shift in state from resting to excitotoxicity changes the underlying fluxes that determine these fractions. Denote neuronal pyruvate dehydrogenase flux by $V_{\\mathrm{PDH,n}}$, astrocytic pyruvate carboxylase flux by $V_{\\mathrm{PC,a}}$, fatty acid synthesis flux by $V_{\\mathrm{FA}}$, and pentose phosphate pathway flux by $V_{\\mathrm{PPP}}$. The pools draw label according to their precursor fluxes: glutamate and glutamine labeling primarily reflects TCA cycle entry and anaplerosis ($V_{\\mathrm{PDH,n}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{PC,a}}$), fatty acids reflect cytosolic acetyl units derived from citrate export (linked to mitochondrial citrate availability and de novo lipogenesis, $\\propto V_{\\mathrm{FA}}$), and ribose reflects carbon channeled through the PPP ($\\propto V_{\\mathrm{PPP}}$).\n\nUnder resting conditions:\n1) Astrocytes have high $V_{\\mathrm{PC,a}}$ and higher $V_{\\mathrm{PPP}}$ than neurons, supporting anaplerotic glutamate production and ribose/NADPH generation.\n2) Neurons rely on $V_{\\mathrm{PDH,n}}$ for acetyl-CoA and TCA cycling, with relatively low anaplerosis and low PPP activity.\n\nExcitotoxicity increases glutamatergic neurotransmission and the glutamate-glutamine cycle. This necessitates:\n- Increased neuronal oxidative metabolism to meet ATP demand, so $V_{\\mathrm{PDH,n}}$ increases, and a greater fraction of glucose-derived pyruvate is directed into the TCA cycle rather than biosynthetic pathways.\n- Increased astrocytic anaplerosis to sustain net glutamate synthesis for the glutamate-glutamine cycle, so $V_{\\mathrm{PC,a}}$ increases to replenish oxaloacetate and downstream glutamate labeling.\n\nThese two changes together elevate the fraction of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ incorporated into the glutamate/glutamine pool.

During excitotoxic energy stress, AMPK activation and increased mitochondrial demand reduce citrate export and inhibit lipogenesis, effectively lowering $V_{\\mathrm{FA}}$. As more pyruvate carbons are oxidized in the TCA cycle to support ATP production and neurotransmitter cycling, fewer labeled acetyl units are available for lipogenesis. Thus,\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{FA}}^{*}<V_{\\mathrm{FA}}^{0}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad f_{\\mathrm{FA}}^{*}<f_{\\mathrm{FA}}^{0}.\n$$\n\nFor the PPP and ribose labeling, although oxidative stress may increase the need for NADPH (potentially altering $V_{\\mathrm{PPP}}$), the fractional distribution among the three measured pools is governed by the relative scaling of fluxes. Excitotoxicity markedly elevates TCA and neurotransmitter cycling fluxes far more than biosynthetic fluxes. Moreover, with $[1,6-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$glucose, the oxidative PPP decarboxylates the C1 label (releasing $^{13}\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the C1 position of glucose 6-phosphate), reducing retention of the label in ribose relative to glycolytic routing into the TCA cycle. Consequently, even if $V_{\\mathrm{PPP}}$ does not decrease absolutely, its contribution to labeled ribose relative to the large increase in TCA-linked labeling declines:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{Ribose}}^{*}<f_{\\mathrm{Ribose}}^{0}.\n$$\n\nGiven $f_{\\mathrm{Glu/Gln}}^{*}+f_{\\mathrm{FA}}^{*}+f_{\\mathrm{Ribose}}^{*}=1$, the simultaneous decrease in $f_{\\mathrm{FA}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{Ribose}}$ necessarily corresponds to an increased $f_{\\mathrm{Glu/Gln}}$. Therefore, the excitotoxic state redirects the fractional $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ labeling primarily toward the glutamate/glutamine pool at the expense of fatty acids and ribose. Among the provided statements, this outcome is exactly captured by option C and is incompatible with A (proportional increase without redistribution), B (dominant shift to PPP and lipids), D (primary increase in neuronal lipogenesis and PPP with reduced neurotransmitter labeling), and E (exclusive astrocytic PC enhancement with neuronal metabolic failure).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$"}]}
