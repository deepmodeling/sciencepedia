The Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), which surrounds the brain and spinal cord, plays a crucial role in this regulation by maintaining a stable pH. Deviations from the normal pH range can severely impair neuronal activity.

This thought experiment explores the hydrophobic effect, a powerful organizing principle that drives protein folding and the formation of cell membranes. Your task is to predict the structural arrangement of an artificial ion channel, applying your understanding of how polar and nonpolar amino acids interact with the aqueous and lipid environments to achieve a stable, functional form.", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, a research team is designing an artificial protein intended to function as an ion channel. This protein is engineered to insert itself into a cell's plasma membrane, which is a lipid bilayer, and form a water-filled pore through its center. The purpose of this pore is to allow specific ions, dissolved in the aqueous environment of the cell, to pass across the membrane. Proteins are constructed from amino acids, which can be broadly categorized based on their side chains' properties: some are hydrophobic (nonpolar, \"water-fearing\") and others are hydrophilic (polar or charged, \"water-loving\"). For the synthetic protein to be thermodynamically stable and function correctly once embedded in the membrane, what must be the predominant orientation of its hydrophobic amino acids?\n\nA. The hydrophobic amino acids must face the central aqueous pore of the channel.\n\nB. The hydrophobic amino acids must face the surrounding lipid bilayer of the membrane.\n\nC. The hydrophobic amino acids must be distributed randomly and uniformly throughout the three-dimensional structure of the protein.\n\nD. The hydrophobic amino acids must be concentrated exclusively at the ends of the protein that are exposed to the extracellular fluid and the intracellular cytoplasm.\n\nE. The hydrophobic amino acids must be completely buried in the absolute core of the protein, shielded from both the lipid bilayer and the aqueous pore.", "solution": "We model the plasma membrane as a lipid bilayer with a hydrophobic core composed of nonpolar acyl chains and aqueous phases on both sides. The engineered channel forms a water-filled pore. For a folded membrane protein to be thermodynamically stable in this anisotropic environment, side chains must partition to minimize the Gibbs free energy:\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S.\n$$\nThe hydrophobic effect states that exposing nonpolar surface area to water orders surrounding water molecules, decreasing entropy and increasing free energy. Conversely, moving nonpolar surface from water into a hydrophobic environment releases ordered water and increases entropy, decreasing free energy. This can be summarized as transfer free energies:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(\\text{hydrophobic}:\\text{water}\\to\\text{lipid}) < 0,\\quad \\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(\\text{hydrophilic}:\\text{water}\\to\\text{lipid}) > 0.\n$$\nIn addition, inserting polar or charged groups into the low-dielectric membrane interior is energetically costly due to desolvation, which can be captured by the Born solvation term\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{Born}} = \\frac{q^{2}}{8\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{mem}}}-\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{water}}}\\right),\n$$\nwhich is positive because $\\varepsilon_{\\text{mem}} \\ll \\varepsilon_{\\text{water}}$. Therefore, polar and charged residues preferentially face aqueous environments, such as the pore lumen or the membrane surfaces, while nonpolar residues preferentially face the hydrophobic lipid core.\n\nApplying these principles to a water-filled ion channel:\n- If hydrophobic residues faced the aqueous pore (option A), they would increase hydrophobic surface area exposed to water, raising $\\Delta G$ and destabilizing the protein.\n- If hydrophobic residues faced the lipid bilayer (option B), they would match nonpolar side chains with the hydrophobic core, lowering $\\Delta G$ via favorable dispersion interactions and increased water entropy.\n- A random uniform distribution (option C) would create numerous mismatches between side-chain polarity and local environment, failing to minimize $\\Delta G$.\n- Concentrating hydrophobic residues at the aqueous-exposed ends (option D) misplaces nonpolar groups into water-rich regions, raising $\\Delta G$.\n- Burying all hydrophobics in an internal core isolated from both lipid and pore (option E) is incompatible with the requirement that the exterior of transmembrane segments must contact the hydrophobic bilayer; moreover, it would force polar residues into the membrane interface with lipid, which is unfavorable.\n\nThus, for thermodynamic stability and proper function, hydrophobic amino acids must predominantly face the surrounding lipid bilayer, while hydrophilic residues line the aqueous pore and the extra- and intracellular interfaces.
