This mutation causes a loss-of-function in the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) receptor, a protein complex embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mutation renders the receptor completely unable to bind to the SRP.\n\nConsider the synthesis and trafficking of a nascent voltage-gated sodium channel ($Na_v$), which is a large, multi-pass transmembrane protein essential for generating action potentials.

Secreted out of the neuron into the extracellular medium.", "solution": "Principle of co-translational targeting: Secretory and integral membrane proteins carry hydrophobic signal sequences that are recognized in the cytosol by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP). SRP binding pauses translation and forms an SRP–ribosome–nascent chain complex. Proper ER targeting requires docking of this complex to the SRP receptor (SR) on the ER membrane. SRP–SR interaction enables handoff of the ribosome to the Sec61 translocon, GTP-dependent release of SRP, and resumption of co-translational translocation/insertion. Multi-pass transmembrane proteins like $Na_{v}$ require repeated engagement with the translocon for correct membrane insertion and topology. Subsequent ER quality control and vesicular trafficking deliver properly folded channels to the plasma membrane.\n\nEffect of an SRP receptor loss-of-function that abolishes SRP binding: The SRP can still bind the emerging signal sequence and pause translation, but without SRP–SR docking, the complex cannot engage the ER translocon. Consequently, co-translational translocation/insertion into the ER does not occur. The stalled complex is resolved in the cytosol: translation either resumes or is terminated outside the ER. In mammalian cells, post-translational ER insertion of large multi-pass membrane proteins is not an efficient or operative pathway; thus, a fully synthesized $Na_{v}$ polypeptide remains in the cytosol.\n\nFate of a cytosolically synthesized multi-pass membrane protein: The $Na_{v}$ channel contains numerous hydrophobic transmembrane segments. In the aqueous cytosol, such a polypeptide cannot properly fold or insert into membranes and will expose hydrophobic regions, leading to misfolding and aggregation. Cytosolic protein quality control pathways (chaperones, ubiquitination, and the proteasome) target these mislocalized proteins for degradation; before degradation, they tend to accumulate as cytosolic aggregates or in quality-control compartments.\n\nExclusion of alternatives:\n- A is incorrect: Without ER targeting and insertion, the channel cannot reach or function in the plasma membrane.\n- B is incorrect: Entry into the ER lumen requires translocation via Sec61, which fails without SRP–SR docking.\n- D is incorrect: Vesicular trafficking to the Golgi originates from the ER; without ER entry, there are no ER-derived transport vesicles carrying $Na_{v}$.\n- E is incorrect: Secretion requires the ER–Golgi pathway.\n\nTherefore, the fully translated but improperly processed $Na_{v}$ primarily accumulates in the cytoplasm as aggregates and/or substrates for degradation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2351425"}, {"introduction": "Once a protein enters the secretory pathway via the ER, it must be sorted in the Golgi apparatus to its final destination.

Research reveals that the hydrolytic enzyme responsible for breaking down these gangliosides, which we will call \"gangliosidase-N,\" is synthesized correctly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. However, due to a genetic mutation affecting a phosphotransferase in the cis-Golgi network, the crucial Mannose-6-Phosphate (M6P) tag cannot be added to the gangliosidase-N precursor. Assuming this enzyme enters the secretory pathway as expected, but lacks its specific sorting signal for its final destination, to which location will it be incorrectly trafficked?\n\nA.

State the normal pathway for lysosomal hydrolases: Lysosomal enzymes are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (via an N-terminal signal peptide that directs cotranslational translocation into the ER lumen), traverse the cis-Golgi, and in the cis-Golgi receive a Mannose-6-Phosphate (M6P) tag through the action of a phosphotransferase. This M6P tag is recognized in the trans-Golgi network by M6P receptors that package the enzymes into clathrin-coated vesicles for delivery to endosomes and then lysosomes.\n\n2. Identify the defect: A mutation in the cis-Golgi phosphotransferase prevents addition of the M6P tag to the lysosomal hydrolase precursor (here, gangliosidase-N). The enzyme is synthesized correctly and enters the secretory pathway but lacks its lysosome-targeting signal.\n\n3. Apply the sorting principle: In the absence of the M6P tag, lysosomal hydrolases are not recognized by M6P receptors in the trans-Golgi network. When a specific sorting signal is missing, proteins in the secretory pathway follow the default constitutive secretory route.\n\n4. Deduce the mislocalization: The default pathway for soluble proteins in the lumen of the ER/Golgi that lack specific retention or targeting signals is constitutive secretion to the extracellular space. This explains the classical finding in I-cell disease of high levels of multiple lysosomal hydrolases in the blood.\n\n5. Exclude other options by signal requirements and compartment access:\n- Mitochondrial matrix (A) requires an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence and post-translational import from the cytosol; proteins that have entered the ER lumen cannot be redirected to mitochondria.\n- Cytosol (B) is inaccessible once a protein has been translocated into the ER lumen; retrotranslocation would require specific quality-control pathways, not default sorting.\n- Nucleoplasm (D) requires a nuclear localization signal and import from the cytosol; again incompatible with prior ER entry.\n- Peroxisome (E) requires peroxisomal targeting signals PTS1 or PTS2 and typically import from the cytosol; ER-lumenal soluble proteins without those signals are not targeted there.\n\n6.

This is achieved via molecular motors that travel along cytoskeletal \"highways.\" This practice problem [@problem_id:2351433] focuses on the kinesin motor protein, the engine of anterograde axonal transport. By examining the impact of blocking kinesin's ability to use its fuel, ATP, you will solidify your understanding of how the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis is converted into the mechanical work necessary for neuronal function and survival.", "problem": "In a laboratory setting, a neuroscientist is studying the process of axonal transport in cultured motor neurons. Axonal transport is the mechanism by which materials are moved between the neuronal cell body (soma) and the axon terminal. Anterograde transport refers to the movement of substances from the soma towards the axon terminal. This process is crucial for delivering newly synthesized proteins, lipids, and organelles, and it is powered by motor proteins called kinesins that move along microtubule tracks. The movement of kinesin is an active process that requires energy from the hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a novel, cell-permeable neurotoxin is introduced to the culture. This toxin specifically targets the kinesin motor protein. Its sole effect is to bind to the kinesin-ATP complex in such a way that it completely inhibits the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate, without affecting kinesin's ability to bind to either ATP or the microtubule itself.\n\nWhat is the most direct and immediate consequence of this toxin on the motor neuron?\n\nA. Anterograde transport will halt, leading to the accumulation of transport vesicles and organelles in the cell body and the proximal axon.\n\nB. Retrograde transport, mediated by dynein, will stop because kinesin and dynein are functionally coupled.\n\nC. Kinesin motors will detach from the microtubules, releasing their cargo to diffuse randomly within the axonal cytoplasm.\n\nD. Both anterograde and retrograde transport will cease because the microtubules will rapidly depolymerize in the absence of motor protein activity.\n\nE. Anterograde transport will reverse its direction, as the stalled kinesins will be pushed backward by dynein motors moving on the same microtubule.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most direct and immediate consequence of inhibiting ATP hydrolysis in kinesin motor proteins within a neuron. To determine the correct answer, we must analyze the mechanism of kinesin-based transport and the specific role of ATP hydrolysis.\n\nStep 1: Understand the basics of anterograde axonal transport.\nAnterograde axonal transport is the directed movement of cellular materials, such as synaptic vesicle precursors, mitochondria, and cytoskeletal proteins, from the cell body (soma) down the axon to the synapse. This process is essential for neuronal function and survival. The \"tracks\" for this transport are microtubules, which are stable polymers forming part of the cell's cytoskeleton. The \"engines\" that move along these tracks are motor proteins. For anterograde transport, the primary motor protein is kinesin.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the function of kinesin and the role of ATP.\nKinesin is an ATPase, meaning it harnesses the chemical energy released from the hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to produce mechanical work (movement). The kinesin motor \"walks\" along a microtubule in a step-wise fashion. This walking cycle is tightly coupled to the ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle. A simplified cycle for a conventional kinesin-1 is as follows:\n1.  A leading motor domain (head) of the kinesin dimer binds to a tubulin subunit on the microtubule.\n2.  Binding of an ATP molecule to this attached head induces a conformational change. This change causes the other, trailing head to swing forward, moving it past the attached head.\n3.  The new leading head binds to the microtubule further along the track.\n4.  The trailing head then hydrolyzes its bound ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This hydrolysis weakens its binding to the microtubule.\n5.  The trailing head detaches from the microtubule after releasing the phosphate, and the cycle repeats with the new leading head.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the effect of the specific neurotoxin.\nThe problem states that the toxin inhibits the *hydrolysis* of ATP. This means that a kinesin head can bind ATP, but it cannot break it down into ADP + Pi. According to the mechanism described in Step 2, the binding of ATP to a microtubule-bound kinesin head is the event that locks that head tightly to the microtubule and triggers the forward swing of the partner head. However, the subsequent step—hydrolysis of ATP in the now-trailing head—is required for that head to detach and complete the step.\n\nIf hydrolysis is blocked, the kinesin motor will bind ATP and its leading head will lock onto the microtubule. The motor will be \"frozen\" in this high-affinity, ATP-bound state. It cannot complete its mechanical cycle to take another step, nor can the trailing head detach. The kinesin motor effectively becomes a stationary roadblock, firmly attached to the microtubule track and its cargo.\n\nStep 4: Assess the given options based on this analysis.\nA. Anterograde transport will halt, leading to the accumulation of transport vesicles and organelles in the cell body and the proximal axon.\nThis is the correct consequence. Since all kinesin motors responsible for anterograde transport are immobilized on their tracks, the entire transport system in that direction will come to a standstill. Cargo that was supposed to be transported down the axon will be unable to leave the cell body, causing it to accumulate there and a short distance into the axon (the proximal axon).\n\nB. Retrograde transport, mediated by dynein, will stop because kinesin and dynein are functionally coupled.\nThis is incorrect. Retrograde transport (from the axon terminal to the soma) is mediated by a different motor protein, dynein. While there can be complex regulatory interactions between the two systems, the direct inhibition of kinesin does not immediately and directly stop dynein, which has its own motor mechanism. Therefore, retrograde transport would likely continue, at least initially.\n\nC. Kinesin motors will detach from the microtubules, releasing their cargo to diffuse randomly within the axonal cytoplasm.\nThis is incorrect. The ATP-bound state of kinesin is a *high-affinity* state for the microtubule. It is the hydrolysis of ATP and subsequent release of phosphate that leads to a low-affinity state and detachment. By preventing hydrolysis, the toxin effectively locks the kinesin *onto* the microtubule, not the other way around.\n\nD. Both anterograde and retrograde transport will cease because the microtubules will rapidly depolymerize in the absence of motor protein activity.\nThis is incorrect. While the long-term health of the axon and its cytoskeleton depends on proper transport, the immediate effect of stopping kinesin does not include the rapid depolymerization of microtubules. Microtubule stability is governed by other factors and proteins, such as microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs).\n\nE. Anterograde transport will reverse its direction, as the stalled kinesins will be pushed backward by dynein motors moving on the same microtubule.\nThis is incorrect. While dynein motors move in the opposite direction, a stalled kinesin is tightly bound to the microtubule. It is more likely to act as a physical obstacle, a \"traffic jam,\" rather than being easily pushed backward. There is no known mechanism by which inhibiting ATP hydrolysis in kinesin would cause it to actively participate in retrograde movement.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and immediate result of inhibiting ATP hydrolysis in kinesin is the complete cessation of anterograde transport, leading to a buildup of materials at the source, as described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2351433"}]}
