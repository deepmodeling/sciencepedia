One of their primary functions is to buffer extracellular potassium (K+) ions, particularly around active synapses. This is accomplished via specialized channels, such as the inwardly-rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1, which are highly expressed on the astrocyte membrane and are typically open at rest.\n\nConsider a single astrocyte under physiological conditions where its resting membrane potential ($V_m$) is measured to be -85 mV. For this same astrocyte, the calculated Nernst potential for potassium ($E_K$) is -90 mV.\n\nBased on these values, determine the net passive movement of potassium ions through any open Kir4.1 channels.\n\nA.

This problem challenges you to model the process of glutamate clearance and quantify how its disruption affects the synapse. By analyzing a hypothetical knockout mouse lacking the glutamate transporter GLAST, you will directly link the efficiency of a single molecular transporter to the overall glutamate exposure at the postsynaptic terminal. [@problem_id:2337074]", "problem": "The tripartite synapse, comprising a presynaptic terminal, a postsynaptic dendrite, and an enveloping astrocytic process, is a fundamental functional unit in the central nervous system. Astrocytes play a critical role in terminating synaptic transmission by clearing neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft. Glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter, is cleared by a family of Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs).\n\nConsider a simplified model of a glutamatergic synapse. Upon release from a single vesicle, the concentration of glutamate, $[G](t)$, in the synaptic cleft decays over time, $t$. This clearance is well-approximated as a first-order process:\n$$[G](t) = [G]_0 \\exp(-k t)$$\nwhere $[G]_0$ is the initial glutamate concentration at $t=0$ and $k$ is the total clearance rate constant.\n\nIn a wild-type (WT) animal, this clearance is mediated by both neuronal transporters and astrocytic transporters. For a specific type of synapse, it has been determined that the astrocytic glutamate transporter GLAST (also known as EAAT1) is responsible for a fraction, $f$, of the total glutamate clearance rate. That is, the rate constant associated with GLAST, $k_{GLAST}$, is related to the total wild-type clearance rate constant, $k_{WT}$, by $k_{GLAST} = f \\cdot k_{WT}$. The remaining clearance is due to other transporters, which we can group with a combined rate constant $k_{other}$.\n\nA neuroscientist develops a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model in which the GLAST transporter is selectively deleted from all astrocytes. Assume that this genetic modification does not cause any compensatory changes in other clearance mechanisms, so the rate constant $k_{other}$ remains the same in both WT and cKO mice.\n\nThe total exposure of postsynaptic receptors to glutamate is a key determinant of the synaptic response and plasticity. This exposure can be quantified by calculating the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), which represents the \"glutamate load\" on the synapse.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total glutamate load in the cKO model to that in the WT model, $\\frac{\\text{AUC}_{cKO}}{\\text{AUC}_{WT}}$.
