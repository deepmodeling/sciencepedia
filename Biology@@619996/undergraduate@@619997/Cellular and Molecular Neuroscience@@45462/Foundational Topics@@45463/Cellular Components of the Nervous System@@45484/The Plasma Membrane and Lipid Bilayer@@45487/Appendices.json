For solute $i$, the steady-state flux magnitude across a membrane of area $A$ and thickness $\\Delta x$ is\n$$\n|J_{i}|=P_{i}\\,A\\,|\\Delta C_{i}|,\n$$\nwhere $P_{i}$ is the permeability coefficient. Holding $A$ and $|\\Delta C_{i}|$ fixed for qualitative ranking, the relative rate is determined by $P_{i}$.

It has a large $K_{i}$ for the hydrophobic core, a small $\\Delta G_{i}$, and diffuses rapidly within the bilayer. Hence $P_{\\text{O}_{2}}$ is highest and $|J_{\\text{O}_{2}}|$ is fastest.\n- Glycerol is small but polar and uncharged. Its polarity reduces $K_{i}$ relative to $\\text{O}_{2}$, increasing $\\Delta G_{i}$, so permeability is lower than $\\text{O}_{2}$ but still nonzero in a pure lipid bilayer. Thus $P_{\\text{glycerol}}<P_{\\text{O}_{2}}$.\n- Potassium ion ($K^{+}$) carries charge and is strongly hydrated. Insertion into the hydrophobic core requires desolvation and unfavorable electrostatic work, giving a very large $\\Delta G_{i}$, an extremely small $K_{i}$, and thus an extremely small $P_{i}$ in the absence of channels. Therefore $P_{K^{+}}\\ll P_{\\text{glycerol}}$.\n- A typical globular protein is a very large macromolecule. Its $K_{i}$ for the hydrophobic core is extremely small due to extensive polar and charged surface, and its intramembrane diffusion coefficient is also drastically reduced by size. By the Stokes–Einstein relation,\n$$\nD=\\frac{k_{B}T}{6\\pi\\eta r},\n$$\nlarger hydrodynamic radius $r$ yields much smaller $D$, further lowering $P=\\frac{KD}{\\Delta x}$. Consequently, $P_{\\text{protein}}$ is even smaller than $P_{K^{+}}$, making it the slowest by far.\n\nCombining these considerations, the permeability (and thus diffusion rate) ranking is\n$$\n\\text{O}_{2}>\\text{glycerol}>K^{+}>\\text{protein},\n$$\nwhich corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2353405"}, {"introduction": "Far from being a static envelope, the neuronal membrane is a highly dynamic structure that participates in critical cellular processes like neurotransmission.

This practice introduces you to Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), a key experimental technique used to probe the mobility of membrane components. By interpreting the results of a hypothetical FRAP experiment, you will learn to deduce crucial information about protein dynamics, such as diffusion speed and whether proteins are freely mobile or anchored in place [@problem_id:2353466].", "problem": "A neurobiologist is investigating the properties of a specific voltage-gated sodium channel population concentrated in the axon initial segment of a neuron. To study their mobility within the plasma membrane, the researcher labels these channels with a green fluorescent protein and performs a Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiment. In this technique, a high-intensity laser is used to irreversibly bleach the fluorophores in a small, circular region of the membrane. The subsequent return of fluorescence to this region is monitored over time as unbleached, fluorescently-tagged channels from the surrounding area diffuse into the bleached spot.\n\nThe experiment reveals two key findings:\n1. The rate of fluorescence recovery is significantly slower compared to the recovery rate of a freely diffusing lipid marker in the same cell type.\n2. After a long period, the fluorescence intensity in the bleached spot only recovers to 55% of its initial, pre-bleach level, at which point it plateaus.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion about the population of voltage-gated sodium channels in the axon initial segment?\n\nA. The majority of the channels are degraded by the laser, and the remaining 55% are highly mobile.\n\nB. All channels are freely diffusing, but the viscosity of the membrane in the axon initial segment is exceptionally high, slowing them down.\n\nC. The channels exhibit low mobility, and a substantial fraction (approximately 45%) of the channels are immobile, likely anchored to the cytoskeleton or other scaffolding proteins.\n\nD. The channels are highly mobile, and the incomplete recovery is an artifact caused by the bleached molecules diffusing back into the observation area.", "solution": "FRAP principle and definitions:\n- In FRAP, fluorophores in a defined region are irreversibly bleached. Fluorescence recovery in that region arises from lateral diffusion of unbleached, fluorescent molecules from outside the bleached area. If a fraction of labeled molecules is immobile (or effectively immobile on the experimental timescale), that fraction does not contribute to recovery, so the recovery plateaus below the pre-bleach intensity.\n- Let $I_{\\text{pre}}$ denote the pre-bleach fluorescence in the region of interest, $I(t)$ the fluorescence at time $t$ after bleaching, and $I(\\infty)$ the long-time plateau. Define the normalized fluorescence $F(t) \\equiv I(t)/I_{\\text{pre}}$, with $F(0)=f_{0}$ after bleaching and $F(\\infty)=M$, where $M$ is the mobile fraction. In ideal normalization that corrects for overall photobleaching and background, $M=1$ if all labeled molecules are mobile and $M<1$ if an immobile fraction is present.\n- The recovery kinetics for lateral diffusion are diffusion-limited, with a characteristic recovery time $\\tau$ that scales inversely with the diffusion coefficient $D$ and increases with the bleach spot size. For a circular bleach spot of radius $r$, one can write $\\tau=\\alpha \\frac{r^{2}}{D}$, where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless factor determined by the bleach/measurement geometry. A slower recovery (larger $\\tau$) indicates a smaller effective $D$ or additional binding that reduces apparent mobility. A common phenomenological form used to fit FRAP recovery is $F(t)=M - \\left(M - f_{0}\\right)\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)$, where the plateau $M$ reflects the mobile fraction.\n\nApplying to the observations:\n1. The rate of recovery is significantly slower than that of a freely diffusing lipid marker in the same membrane. Using $\\tau=\\alpha \\frac{r^{2}}{D}$, this implies $D_{\\text{channels}}<D_{\\text{lipid}}$ or that the channels experience additional interactions (e.g., binding to scaffolds) that reduce effective mobility. Thus, the channels exhibit low mobility compared to lipids.\n2. The long-time recovery plateaus at $0.55$ of the initial, pre-bleach level. With the normalization above, $F(\\infty)=M=0.55$. Therefore, the immobile fraction is $1-M=0.45$. An immobile fraction of approximately $0.45$ indicates that a substantial subset of channels is immobilized on the experimental timescale, consistent with anchoring to cytoskeletal or scaffolding proteins (e.g., known ankyrin-G/spectrin scaffolds in the axon initial segment).\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: FRAP bleaching renders fluorophores nonfluorescent but does not preferentially degrade most proteins in a way that explains the plateau; if all channels were mobile, recovery would approach the pre-bleach level after sufficient time (modulo global photobleaching corrections), not stall at $0.55$.\n- B is incorrect: Increased membrane viscosity (reduced $D$) would slow the recovery (increase $\\tau$) but would not reduce the plateau; if all channels were freely diffusing, $M$ would be $1$, not $0.55$.\n- C is correct: The slower kinetics indicate low mobility, and the incomplete recovery implies an immobile fraction of about $0.45$, consistent with anchoring to cytoskeletal/scaffolding elements.\n- D is incorrect: Bleached molecules diffusing back are nonfluorescent and do not increase the signal; in an ideal FRAP with purely mobile molecules, recovery approaches the pre-bleach level after equilibration. The incomplete recovery therefore reflects a genuine immobile fraction, not an artifact from bleached molecules re-entering the region.\n\nConclusion: The data indicate low mobility and an immobile fraction of approximately $0.45$, consistent with cytoskeletal anchoring in the axon initial segment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2353466"}]}
