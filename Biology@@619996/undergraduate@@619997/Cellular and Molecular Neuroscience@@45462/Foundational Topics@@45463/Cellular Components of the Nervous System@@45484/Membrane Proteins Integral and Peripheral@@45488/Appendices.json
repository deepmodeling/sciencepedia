Integral proteins are held fast by strong hydrophobic interactions within the lipid bilayer, while peripheral proteins associate more transiently through electrostatic forces and other non-covalent bonds. This practice challenges you to think like a biochemist by designing an experimental strategy to exploit these differences, allowing for the selective separation of a peripheral protein from its membrane-bound partners. Mastering this logic is key to isolating proteins for further study. [@problem_id:2342061]", "problem": "A neuroscientist is studying protein interactions at the presynaptic terminal. They have successfully isolated a pure sample of synaptic vesicles from rat brain homogenate. These vesicles are suspended in a physiological buffer solution that mimics the intracellular environment (e.g., pH 7.4, moderate salt concentration). The synaptic vesicle membrane is known to contain two proteins of interest:\n\n1.  **Protein I (Integral):** A transmembrane protein with a significant hydrophobic alpha-helical domain that spans the lipid bilayer. It is essential for vesicle docking.\n2.  **Protein P (Peripheral):** A protein that binds to the cytoplasmic face of the vesicle membrane primarily through electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged phospholipid head groups.\n\nThe researcher's goal is to selectively remove Protein P from the vesicles and collect it in a soluble fraction for further analysis, while leaving Protein I embedded in the vesicle membrane and the vesicles themselves structurally intact. After applying a treatment, the sample will be centrifuged at high speed to pellet the vesicles. The supernatant (the liquid above the pellet) would then be collected.

The ionic strength is $I=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i} c_{i} z_{i}^{2}$. As $I$ increases, the Debye screening length decreases, with $\\kappa^{-1}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon k_{B} T}{2 N_{A} e^{2} I}}$. A smaller $\\kappa^{-1}$ reduces the range and strength of electrostatic interactions, favoring dissociation of electrostatically bound proteins from the membrane surface.\n- Integral membrane proteins are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions within the lipid bilayer. These interactions are not disrupted by high salt; thus, integral proteins remain embedded provided detergents or membrane-disrupting conditions are not applied.\n- Detergents that form micelles (ionic or non-ionic) solubilize lipid bilayers and extract integral membrane proteins; such treatments compromise vesicle integrity and are not selective for peripheral proteins.\n- Hypotonic shock induces osmotic swelling, governed by $\\Pi = i c R T$, which can rupture vesicles, compromising structural integrity and releasing membrane fragments rather than selectively dissociating peripheral proteins.\n- Reducing agents (e.g., DTT) reduce disulfide bonds but do not directly disrupt electrostatic proteinâ€“membrane interactions; thus they are not appropriate for selectively releasing electrostatically bound peripheral proteins.\n\nEvaluation of options:\nA. High salt (e.g., 1.0 M NaCl): Increases $I$, decreases $\\kappa^{-1}$, screens electrostatics, and specifically weakens Protein P interactions with negatively charged head groups. Integral membrane protein I remains in the bilayer due to hydrophobic partitioning. Vesicles remain intact in high ionic strength buffers. After centrifugation, vesicles pellet while dissociated Protein P remains in the supernatant. This matches the stated goal.\nB. Strong ionic detergent (e.g., 2% SDS): SDS binds and denatures proteins and solubilizes membranes into mixed micelles, extracting both peripheral and integral proteins and destroying vesicle integrity. This is not selective and does not preserve vesicles.\nC. Hypotonic solution (e.g., deionized water): Creates an osmotic gradient leading to vesicle swelling and lysis, releasing vesicle contents and membrane fragments; does not specifically disrupt electrostatic peripheral binding and compromises structural integrity.\nD. Non-ionic detergent (e.g., 1% Triton X-100): Solubilizes lipid bilayers into micelles while often preserving protein native structure, extracting integral proteins and destroying vesicle integrity; not selective for peripheral proteins.\nE. High DTT (e.g., 100 mM): Reduces disulfide bonds but does not effectively disrupt electrostatic interactions between Protein P and lipid head groups; will not selectively release Protein P and is unnecessary.\n\nConclusion: The most appropriate and specific protocol is high-salt incubation to selectively strip the electrostatically bound peripheral protein while leaving integral proteins in intact vesicles, followed by centrifugation to pellet vesicles and collect Protein P in the supernatant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2342061"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply associating with the membrane, integral proteins must adopt a specific orientation, or topology, to function correctly.

ER lumen corresponds to the extracellular space at the plasma membrane, while the cytosolic side remains cytosolic.\n\n- Implication for the C-terminal GFP fusion:\n  GFP is fused to the C-terminus of Synectin-1. Since the C-terminus of a Type I protein is cytosolic, the GFP moiety will reside on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. GFP is a soluble protein and will not be embedded within the lipid bilayer, nor will it be secreted, because the fusion protein is membrane-anchored via the stop-transfer segment.\n\n- Conclusion about fluorescence localization:\n  The GFP fluorescence will be observed on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane.\n\n- Elimination of alternatives:\n  A is incorrect because the N-terminus, not the C-terminus, faces the extracellular side.

A crucial task for a neuroscientist is to map the architecture of these complexes to understand how signals are processed. This practice introduces you to FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a sophisticated technique that functions as a molecular ruler to measure the proximity between proteins. By analyzing a series of FRET experiments, you will act as a molecular detective to deduce the precise arrangement of a receptor, a signaling protein, and a scaffold, building a model of their interaction from the ground up. [@problem_id:2342069]", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating a signaling pathway at the postsynaptic density. The pathway involves an integral transmembrane receptor, designated 'R', and a peripheral signaling protein, 'S'. It is hypothesized that the interaction between R and S might be mediated by a newly identified cytosolic scaffold protein, 'B'. To elucidate the molecular architecture of this complex, the scientist employs FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a distance-dependent physical process through which energy is transferred from an excited molecular fluorophore (the donor) to another fluorophore (the acceptor).\n\nThe experiment uses genetically encoded fluorophores fused to the proteins of interest: Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) as the donor and Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) as the acceptor. When the donor (CFP) is excited with light at a wavelength of 433 nm, it typically emits light at 475 nm. However, if an acceptor (YFP) is within approximately 1-10 nanometers of the donor, the excited donor can transfer its energy to the acceptor, causing the acceptor to emit light at its characteristic wavelength of 527 nm. The occurrence of FRET is therefore a proxy for close molecular proximity.\n\nThe scientist performs a series of experiments in a cell line capable of expressing these protein constructs. The results of these experiments are summarized below:\n\n- **Condition 1:** Cells express a Receptor-CFP fusion protein (R-CFP). When illuminated at 433 nm, a strong emission peak is detected at 475 nm.\n- **Condition 2:** Cells express a Signaling protein-YFP fusion protein (S-YFP). When illuminated at 433 nm, no significant emission is detected at either 475 nm or 527 nm.\n- **Condition 3:** Cells co-express R-CFP and S-YFP. When illuminated at 433 nm, a strong emission peak is observed at 475 nm, but no significant emission peak is observed at 527 nm.\n- **Condition 4:** Cells co-express R-CFP, S-YFP, and the unlabeled wild-type scaffold protein B. When illuminated at 433 nm, the emission intensity at 475 nm is significantly reduced, and a strong emission peak appears at 527 nm.\n- **Condition 5:** Cells co-express a scaffold protein-CFP fusion (B-CFP) and S-YFP. When illuminated at 433 nm, a strong emission peak is observed at 527 nm alongside a diminished peak at 475 nm.\n- **Condition 6:** Cells co-express a scaffold protein-CFP fusion (B-CFP) and a Receptor-YFP fusion (R-YFP).

Protein S binds directly to the receptor R. The scaffold protein B is not involved in this interaction.\n\nB. Protein S forms a homodimer that prevents its interaction with either receptor R or scaffold protein B.\n\nC.

The signaling protein S associates with the receptor R via an indirect interaction, with the scaffold protein B acting as a molecular bridge.", "solution": "We use the physical principle of FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET): when a donor fluorophore (CFP) and an acceptor fluorophore (YFP) are within a nanometer-scale distance, nonradiative energy transfer from donor to acceptor occurs. The FRET efficiency is given by\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{r}{R_{0}}\\right)^{6}},\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the donor-acceptor distance and $R_{0}$ is the FÃ¶rster radius specific to the fluorophore pair. Observable consequences of $E>0$ are a reduction in donor emission (quenching at 475 nm for CFP) upon donor excitation and a concomitant increase in acceptor emission (sensitized emission at 527 nm for YFP) when the donor is excited at 433 nm. Controls must also exclude direct excitation of the acceptor at 433 nm and spectral bleed-through.\n\nApplying these principles to each condition:\n\nCondition 1 establishes the donor-only control: R-CFP alone, excited at 433 nm, emits strongly at 475 nm, consistent with donor fluorescence in the absence of an acceptor and thus $E \\approx 0$.\n\nCondition 2 establishes the acceptor-only control under donor excitation: S-YFP alone, excited at 433 nm, shows no emission at 475 nm or 527 nm, indicating minimal or no direct excitation of YFP at 433 nm and no donor contamination. This rules out false-positive acceptor emission due to direct excitation.\n\nCondition 3 tests for direct proximity between R and S: co-expression of R-CFP and S-YFP yields strong 475 nm emission and no 527 nm emission upon 433 nm excitation, indicating $E \\approx 0$. Therefore, R and S are not within the FRET distance and do not directly associate in a manner detectable by FRET under these conditions.\n\nCondition 4 tests the effect of adding unlabeled scaffold B: co-expression of R-CFP, S-YFP, and B results in diminished 475 nm emission with a strong 527 nm peak upon 433 nm excitation, indicating $E>0$. Because the acceptor (YFP on S) shows sensitized emission only when B is present, B must bring R and S into proximity. This implies that B mediates an indirect association between R and S.\n\nCondition 5 tests pairwise interaction between B and S: B-CFP with S-YFP shows diminished donor emission at 475 nm and strong acceptor emission at 527 nm upon 433 nm excitation, indicating $E>0$ between B and S. Therefore, B binds or closely associates with S.\n\nCondition 6 tests pairwise interaction between B and R: B-CFP with R-YFP again shows diminished donor emission and strong acceptor emission upon 433 nm excitation, indicating $E>0$ between B and R. Therefore, B binds or closely associates with R.\n\nLogical synthesis of all conditions:\n- Conditions 5 and 6 demonstrate that B is in close proximity to both S and R, consistent with direct interactions between B-S and B-R.\n- Condition 3 rules out a direct R-S interaction detectable by FRET.\n- Condition 4 shows that inclusion of B brings R and S into FRET proximity, consistent with B acting as a bridge that scaffolds S and R together.\n- Controls (Conditions 1 and 2) eliminate artifactual interpretations due to direct acceptor excitation or spectral bleed-through.\n\nThese findings rule out options A (direct S-R interaction; contradicted by Condition 3), B (S homodimer preventing interactions; contradicted by B-S and B-R FRET in Conditions 5 and 6), C (S does not interact with B; contradicted by Condition 5), and D (B does not associate with R; contradicted by Condition 6).
