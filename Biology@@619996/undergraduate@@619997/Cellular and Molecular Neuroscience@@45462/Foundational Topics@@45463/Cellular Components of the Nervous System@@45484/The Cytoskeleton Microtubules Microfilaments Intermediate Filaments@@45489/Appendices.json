However, microscopic tracking reveals that empty vesicles, which would normally be recycled, accumulate at the axon terminal and fail to return to the cell body.

Microtubules in axons are uniformly polarized with plus ends oriented distally (toward the axon terminal) and minus ends oriented proximally (toward the soma).\n- Motor specificity on microtubules is direction-dependent: kinesins are predominantly plus-end-directed motors that mediate anterograde transport (from soma to axon terminal), whereas cytoplasmic dynein is a minus-end-directed motor that mediates retrograde transport (from axon terminal to soma).\n- The observed phenotype shows efficient movement of newly synthesized vesicles from the soma to the terminal (intact anterograde transport), but failure of empty vesicles to return to the soma and accumulation at the terminal (defective retrograde transport).\n- Therefore, the most specific single-gene loss-of-function explanation is a defect in the retrograde motor cytoplasmic dynein.\n- Alternative options are less consistent:\n  - Kinesin (A) mediates anterograde transport; its loss would impair movement from soma to terminal, which is normal here.\n  - Tubulin (C) defects typically disrupt microtubule integrity and thus both directions of transport, not selectively retrograde.\n  - Actin (D) microfilaments are involved in local trafficking near synapses and growth cones, not primary long-range axonal transport.\n  - Postsynaptic receptors (E) are unrelated to axonal transport in the presynaptic neuron.\n- Hence, the most likely affected component is the motor protein dynein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2318472"}, {"introduction": "Beyond serving as transport tracks, the cytoskeleton is the primary architect of a neuron's complex shape.

Microtubules, a key component of the cytoskeleton, are organized differently in these compartments, largely due to the localization of specific Microtubule-Associated Proteins (MAPs). In a typical mammalian neuron, the protein Tau is found in axons, where it bundles microtubules closely, while the protein MAP2 is found in dendrites, creating a much wider spacing between microtubules.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a cultured neuron is genetically engineered. This modification causes the complete replacement of Tau with MAP2 in the axon, while the dendrites are unaffected for the purpose of this problem.

In the crowded environment of the axon, a motor's ability to remain attached to its microtubule track—its processivity—is just as crucial as its stepping rate.

This mutation adversely affects fast axonal transport. To investigate the mechanism, researchers conduct single-molecule biophysical experiments on both the wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) kinesin motors.\n\nThe data can be explained by a model with the following assumptions:\n1.  The motor moves along a microtubule track with a fixed step size, $d$.\n2.  While attached, the motor's instantaneous velocity is $v_{motor} = d \\cdot k_{step}$, where $k_{step}$ is the rate-limiting stepping rate, assumed to be equal to the rate of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis under saturating ATP conditions.\n3.  The motor's processivity, defined as the average number of steps it takes before spontaneously detaching from the microtubule, is given by the ratio $P = k_{step} / k_{off}$, where $k_{off}$ is the microtubule dissociation rate.\n4.
