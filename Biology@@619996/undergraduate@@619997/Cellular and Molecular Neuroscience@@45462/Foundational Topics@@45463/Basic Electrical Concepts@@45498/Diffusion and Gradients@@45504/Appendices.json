This exercise prompts you to analyze a scenario where these forces are not in balance, requiring you to determine the direction of the net electrochemical driving force. Mastering this concept, as explored in this problem [@problem_id:2334225], is fundamental to predicting ion flow and understanding how neurons generate electrical signals.", "problem": "Consider a typical mammalian neuron where the intracellular concentration of chloride ions ($Cl^{-}$) is significantly lower than the extracellular concentration. Due to this concentration difference and the typical distribution of other ions, the equilibrium potential for chloride, $E_{Cl}$, is calculated to be -65 mV. Imagine that this neuron's membrane potential, $V_m$, is being held by an experimental clamp at a value of -80 mV. At this moment, a set of ligand-gated ion channels that are exclusively permeable to $Cl^{-}$ ions are suddenly opened.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the forces acting on the $Cl^{-}$ ions and their resulting net movement across the membrane?\n\nA. The electrical force pushing $Cl^{-}$ out of the cell is stronger than the chemical force pushing $Cl^{-}$ into the cell, resulting in a net efflux of $Cl^{-}$.\n\nB. The chemical force pushing $Cl^{-}$ into the cell is stronger than the electrical force pushing $Cl^{-}$ out of the cell, resulting in a net influx of $Cl^{-}$.\n\nC. The electrical force and the chemical force both push $Cl^{-}$ into the cell, resulting in a strong net influx of $Cl^{-}$.\n\nD. The electrical force pushing $Cl^{-}$ out of the cell is perfectly balanced by the chemical force pushing $Cl^{-}$ into the cell, resulting in no net movement of $Cl^{-}$.\n\nE. Since ions move down their concentration gradient, the flow is determined entirely by the chemical force, causing an influx of $Cl^{-}$ regardless of the membrane potential.", "solution": "By definition, the Nernst (equilibrium) potential for an ion $X$ is given by\n$$\nE_{X}=\\frac{RT}{zF}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[X]_{\\text{out}}}{[X]_{\\text{in}}}\\right),\n$$\nand it is the membrane potential $V_{m}$ at which the electrical and chemical driving forces on that ion exactly balance, yielding no net flux.\n\nFor chloride, $z=-1$, and we are given $E_{Cl}=-65\\ \\text{mV}$. The membrane is clamped at $V_{m}=-80\\ \\text{mV}$. The net electrochemical driving force relevant for ionic current is\n$$\nV_{m}-E_{X}.\n$$\nFor chloride channels with conductance $g_{Cl}$, the chloride current (with the electrophysiological sign convention for current) is\n$$\nI_{Cl}=g_{Cl}\\left(V_{m}-E_{Cl}\\right).\n$$\nHere,\n$$\nV_{m}-E_{Cl}=(-80\\ \\text{mV})-(-65\\ \\text{mV})=-15\\ \\text{mV}<0,\n$$\nso $I_{Cl}<0$. A negative current corresponds to an inward flow of positive charge; because chloride carries negative charge, this means an outward flux (efflux) of $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ions.\n\nThis direction can also be understood by decomposing the forces:\n- Chemical force: since $[Cl^{-}]_{\\text{out}}> [Cl^{-}]_{\\text{in}}$, diffusion drives $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ into the cell.\n- Electrical force: since $V_{m}=-80\\ \\text{mV}$ is more negative than $E_{Cl}=-65\\ \\text{mV}$, the inside is more negative than at equilibrium, so the electrical repulsion on negative charge is stronger than at equilibrium and pushes $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ out of the cell.\n\nAt $V_{m}=E_{Cl}$ the electrical and chemical forces would balance exactly. Here $V_{m}<E_{Cl}$, so the electrical force exceeds the chemical force and the net movement is an efflux of $\\text{Cl}^{-}$. Therefore, the correct statement is that the electrical force pushing $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ out is stronger than the chemical force pushing it in, producing a net efflux.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2334225"}, {"introduction": "While a single ion's equilibrium potential is a useful concept, a neuron's resting membrane potential, $V_m$, is a dynamic consensus determined by the contributions of multiple ion species.
