It posits that the nervous system is composed of discrete, individual cells called neurons, which are the basic structural and functional units for information processing. According to this doctrine, a neuron typically acts as a specialized, one-way information processing device.\n\nBased on this principle, if one were to design a minimal, biologically-inspired computational unit that mimics the core function of a single neuron, which of the following sets of components best represents the essential structural parts for receiving, processing, and transmitting information, respectively?\n\nA.

Axon, Soma (Cell Body), Dendrites", "solution": "The Neuron Doctrine asserts that individual neurons are discrete units in which information typically flows in a single direction. To emulate a minimal, biologically-inspired computational unit, we must identify the canonical sequence of functional stages in a neuron: reception of inputs, integration/processing of those inputs, and transmission of output.\n\nFirst, reception is mediated primarily by dendrites. Dendrites bear synaptic receptors that receive chemical signals from presynaptic neurons and convert them into postsynaptic potentials. Thus, dendrites correspond to the input stage.\n\nSecond, processing occurs in the soma (cell body), where synaptic inputs arriving at dendrites and the soma are integrated through spatial and temporal summation. The soma, together with the axon hillock/initial segment, determines whether the membrane potential reaches the threshold for initiating an action potential. Therefore, the soma corresponds to the processing stage.\n\nThird, transmission is mediated by the axon, which conducts action potentials away from the soma toward the axon terminals, where signals are passed to downstream targets at synapses. Hence, the axon corresponds to the output stage.\n\nEvaluating the options: \n- A correctly lists dendrites (receiving), soma (processing), and axon (transmitting) in the canonical order. \n- B lists structures largely confined to the axon and conduction (myelin sheath and nodes of Ranvier), not the triad of receive-process-transmit.\n- C lists intracellular organelles important for cellular metabolism, not the structural communication pathway.\n- D mixes a junction (synapse), a support cell type (glial cell), and a signaling molecule (neurotransmitter), which are not the three structural parts of a single neuron for input, processing, and output.\n- E reverses the functional order and misassigns roles relative to the one-way flow.\n\nTherefore, the correct set is dendrites, soma, axon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2353183"}, {"introduction": "A core tenet of the Neuron Doctrine is that neurons are discrete cells separated by a gap, the synapse, refuting the earlier idea of a continuous cytoplasmic network. This anatomical gap is not just a structural feature; it has profound functional consequences. This practice problem allows you to quantify one of these consequences—the synaptic delay—and appreciate why the total time for a neural signal to cross a circuit is always longer than pure conduction time along an uninterrupted axon [@problem_id:2353225].", "problem": "Consider a simple monosynaptic reflex arc in an organism. This pathway consists of a sensory neuron synapsing directly onto a motor neuron. The axon of the sensory neuron has a length of $L_s = 60.0$ cm, and the axon of the motor neuron has a length of $L_m = 40.0$ cm. Both axons are myelinated and propagate action potentials at a constant conduction velocity of $v = 105$ m/s. An experiment measures the total time from the activation of a receptor at the distal end of the sensory neuron to the response of the muscle fiber innervated by the motor neuron. This total reflex time is measured to be $T_{total} = 11.0$ ms.\n\nAssuming that the time required for sensory receptor activation and for transmission at the neuromuscular junction is negligible, calculate the duration of the synaptic delay at the single, central synapse between the sensory and motor neurons.\n\nExpress your answer in milliseconds (ms), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The total reflex time equals the sum of the conduction times along the sensory and motor axons plus the synaptic delay at the central synapse.

This doctrine encompasses several key principles governing how neurons are organized and how they communicate. Imagine a neurobiologist, while studying an exotic deep-sea organism, discovers a unique type of neuron. This neuron characteristically receives input signals at its axon terminal. These inputs trigger an action potential that propagates \"backwards\" along the axon towards the cell body (soma), a process known as antidromic propagation. The signal is then transmitted to other cells from the surface of the soma and dendrites, which act as the output regions.\n\nThis observation directly challenges which one of the following core tenets of the neuron doctrine?\n\nA. The Neuron as the Structural and Functional Unit: The principle that the nervous system is composed of discrete individual cells called neurons, which are the basic units of structure and function.\n\nB.

The observation of a unique neuron with unusual input-output locations does not imply continuity of cytoplasm between cells or a rejection of cellular individuality. Therefore, A is not challenged.\n\n2) Option B (Connectional Specificity) states that neurons form specific, precise connections rather than indiscriminate ones. The observation specifies where inputs and outputs occur in this neuron but does not indicate indiscriminate or nonspecific connectivity. Therefore, B is not challenged.\n\n3) Option C (Dynamic Polarization) states that information flow within a neuron proceeds in a single, predictable direction: from receptive regions (classically dendrites and soma) to the transmitting region (axon and axon terminals). In the observation, the neuron receives inputs at the axon terminal, generates an action potential that propagates antidromically toward the soma, and then transmits outputs from the soma and dendrites. This reverses the canonical input-output polarity and thus directly contradicts the principle of dynamic polarization.\n\n4) Option D (Existence of Synaptic Clefts) states that neurons are not continuous and communicate across synapses. The observation does not imply continuity between neurons nor the absence of synaptic gaps. Therefore, D is not challenged.\n\nHence, the observation directly challenges the Principle of Dynamic Polarization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2353203"}]}
