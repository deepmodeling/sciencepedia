During the early stages of cerebral ischemia, which occurs when blood flow to the brain is insufficient, the supply of oxygen and glucose is severely limited. This leads to a rapid depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A primary consequence of this ATP depletion is the failure of the Na+/K+-ATPase ion pump, an enzyme crucial for maintaining neuronal resting membrane potential. The failure of this pump results in a massive, uncontrolled influx of sodium ions ($Na^+$) into the neuron's cytoplasm. This event is a critical trigger for a condition known as cytotoxic edema, where the neuron rapidly swells.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and immediate biophysical explanation for this ischemia-induced cellular swelling?\n\nA. The influx of sodium ions increases the total intracellular solute concentration, creating an osmotic gradient that drives water into the cell.\n\nB. The Na+/K+-ATPase pump, when failing, reverses its function and begins to actively transport water into the neuron.\n\nC. The increase in intracellular sodium directly increases the hydrostatic pressure inside the cell, forcing it to expand.\n\nD. The sodium ions chemically react with cytoplasmic proteins, causing them to unfold and increase in volume.\n\nE. The electrical depolarization caused by sodium influx weakens the structure of the cell membrane, allowing it to stretch and passively absorb extracellular fluid.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the immediate biophysical consequence of ATP depletion during early cerebral ischemia. The $\\mathrm{Na^{+}/K^{+}}$-ATPase normally maintains ionic gradients by exporting $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and importing $\\mathrm{K^{+}}$. ATP depletion halts this pump, so $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ enters the neuron down its electrochemical gradient via leaks and transporters. Electrically, charge neutrality is maintained by accompanying anions (often $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$) or existing impermeant intracellular anions, but the key effect is an increase in the effective intracellular osmolyte concentration.\n\nLet $c_{\\text{in}}$ and $c_{\\text{out}}$ denote the total effective osmolyte concentrations inside and outside the cell, respectively (sum over osmotically active solutes, each weighted by its reflection coefficient). For an ideal dilute solution, the osmotic pressure is given by the van ’t Hoff relation:\n$$\n\\Pi = R T \\sum_{i} c_{i},\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is absolute temperature. For a semipermeable membrane characterized by reflection coefficient $\\sigma_{i}$ for solute $i$, the effective contribution to the osmotic driving force is $\\sigma_{i} R T \\Delta c_{i}$, so the net osmotic pressure difference across the neuronal membrane is\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi \\equiv \\Pi_{\\text{in}} - \\Pi_{\\text{out}} = R T \\sum_{i} \\sigma_{i} \\left(c_{i,\\text{in}} - c_{i,\\text{out}}\\right).\n$$\nBecause water permeability is high (via aquaporins and bilayer), and small ions like $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ are relatively restricted on the timescale of early ischemia (so $\\sigma_{i} \\approx 1$ for these solutes), the influx of $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ increases $c_{\\text{in}}$, thereby increasing $\\Pi_{\\text{in}}$ and making $\\Delta \\Pi > 0$.\n\nWater flux across the membrane is described by the Kedem–Katchalsky relation for volume flow:\n$$\nJ_{v} = L_{p} \\left(\\Delta P - \\sum_{i} \\sigma_{i} R T \\Delta c_{i}\\right) = L_{p} \\left(\\Delta P - \\Delta \\Pi\\right),\n$$\nwhere $L_{p}$ is the hydraulic permeability and $\\Delta P \\equiv P_{\\text{in}} - P_{\\text{out}}$ is the hydrostatic pressure difference. Immediately after pump failure, $\\Delta P \\approx 0$, so\n$$\nJ_{v} \\approx - L_{p} \\Delta \\Pi.\n$$\nWith $\\Delta \\Pi > 0$, this implies water flows into the cell (sign convention: negative $J_{v}$ corresponds to inward water flux when $\\Delta \\Pi$ is defined as above), increasing cell volume and producing cytotoxic edema. The swelling proceeds until rising intracellular hydrostatic pressure and membrane-cytoskeletal tension increase $\\Delta P$ to balance $\\Delta \\Pi$, satisfying $J_{v} = 0$ at equilibrium:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\Delta \\Pi.\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- A correctly states that increased intracellular $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ raises intracellular osmolality, generating an osmotic gradient that drives water influx, as quantified by the van ’t Hoff and Kedem–Katchalsky relations above.\n- B is incorrect because the $\\mathrm{Na^{+}/K^{+}}$-ATPase does not reverse to pump water; it is an ion pump, and water transport is passive via osmotic and hydraulic driving forces, not active pumping by this enzyme.\n- C is incorrect because intracellular hydrostatic pressure does not increase directly from $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ accumulation; rather, hydrostatic pressure rises secondarily due to osmotic water influx.\n- D is incorrect because there is no immediate chemical unfolding of proteins by $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ that explains the rapid swelling; the dominant mechanism is osmotic.\n- E is incorrect because membrane depolarization does not directly weaken bilayer mechanics to allow bulk fluid uptake; again, osmotic forces dominate.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and immediate biophysical explanation is the osmotic water influx driven by increased intracellular solute concentration due to $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ accumulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2343433"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of excitotoxicity lies the overstimulation of glutamate receptors, but not all receptors contribute equally or at the same time. This thought experiment uses a hypothetical, genetically-engineered neuron to isolate the specific roles of AMPA and NMDA receptors in the toxic cascade [@problem_id:2343411]. By analyzing this scenario, you will clarify the critical sequence of events, from initial membrane depolarization to the massive calcium influx that drives cell death.", "problem": "In the context of studying the cellular mechanisms of ischemic stroke, a neuroscientist develops a line of cultured cortical neurons. These neurons are genetically engineered so that their alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors are completely impermeable to calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). However, their permeability to sodium ions ($Na^{+}$) and their response to the neurotransmitter glutamate remain identical to those of wild-type neurons.\n\nBoth the engineered neurons and a control group of wild-type neurons are subjected to a prolonged, pathologically high concentration of glutamate, a condition designed to induce excitotoxicity. At resting membrane potential, the channels of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in both neuron types are blocked by magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$).\n\nBased on the known mechanisms of ionotropic glutamate receptors, which of the following statements most accurately describes the initial postsynaptic response of an engineered neuron compared to a wild-type neuron at the onset of this excitotoxic glutamate signal?\n\nA. The engineered neuron will fail to depolarize because its AMPA receptors are modified.\n\nB. The magnesium block on the NMDA receptors of the engineered neuron will remain in place, preventing their activation.\n\nC. The engineered neuron will be completely protected from any form of calcium-mediated excitotoxicity.\n\nD. The initial depolarization of the engineered neuron will occur, but the early phase of calcium influx that is directly mediated by AMPA receptors will be absent.\n\nE. The engineered neuron will hyperpolarize in response to glutamate, reversing the typical postsynaptic potential.", "solution": "Glutamate-gated ionotropic receptors produce a postsynaptic current determined by their conductance and driving forces. For AMPA receptors, the synaptic current can be written as\n$$\nI_{\\text{AMPA}}=g_{\\text{AMPA}}(V_{m}-E_{\\text{AMPA}}),\n$$\nwhere $g_{\\text{AMPA}}$ is the glutamate-activated conductance, $V_{m}$ is membrane potential, and $E_{\\text{AMPA}}$ is the reversal potential. Because AMPA receptors are nonselective cation channels with permeability to $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$ (and, in some subunit compositions, to $Ca^{2+}$), their reversal potential is near $0$ due to the mixed cation selectivity. At resting membrane potential, $V_{m}$ is negative relative to $E_{\\text{AMPA}}$, so opening AMPA receptors produces an inward current dominated by $Na^{+}$ influx, depolarizing the membrane toward $E_{\\text{AMPA}}$.\n\nIn the engineered neurons, the AMPA receptors are made completely impermeable to $Ca^{2+}$, but their permeability to $Na^{+}$ and responsiveness to glutamate are unchanged. Therefore, $g_{\\text{AMPA}}$ for $Na^{+}$ is preserved and the driving force for $Na^{+}$ at rest remains large. Consequently, activation of AMPA receptors still produces an inward $Na^{+}$ current and depolarization:\n$$\nI_{\\text{AMPA,engineered}} \\approx g_{\\text{AMPA,Na}}(V_{m}-E_{\\text{Na,K-mix}}),\n$$\nwith no $Ca^{2+}$ term, but with similar depolarizing effect because $E_{\\text{Na,K-mix}}$ remains near $0$.\n\nNMDA receptors require both ligand binding and relief of the voltage-dependent $Mg^{2+}$ block. At resting potential, the NMDA channel pore is blocked by $Mg^{2+}$; depolarization is needed to remove this block. Because the engineered neurons still depolarize via AMPA-mediated $Na^{+}$ influx, the $Mg^{2+}$ block can be relieved after the initial depolarization, allowing NMDA receptor activation and substantial $Ca^{2+}$ influx.\n\nComparing early events at the onset of the excitotoxic glutamate exposure:\n- The engineered neurons will not fail to depolarize, because $Na^{+}$ permeability via AMPA receptors is intact (refuting A).\n- The $Mg^{2+}$ block on NMDA receptors will not remain in place once AMPA-mediated depolarization occurs; it is relieved by depolarization (refuting B).\n- The neurons are not completely protected from calcium-mediated excitotoxicity, because NMDA receptor and voltage-gated $Ca^{2+}$ channel influx can still occur (refuting C).\n- Glutamate does not cause hyperpolarization via AMPA receptors (refuting E).\n\nTherefore, the accurate statement is that the initial depolarization via AMPA receptors still occurs, but the early, direct $Ca^{2+}$ influx through AMPA receptors is absent in the engineered neurons.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2343411"}, {"introduction": "Excitotoxicity is not solely a story of over-excitation; it is also a story of failing inhibition.
