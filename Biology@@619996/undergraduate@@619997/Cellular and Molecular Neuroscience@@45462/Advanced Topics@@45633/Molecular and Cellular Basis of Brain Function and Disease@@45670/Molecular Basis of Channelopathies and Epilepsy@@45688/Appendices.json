This practice explores the critical role of slow inactivation, a key braking mechanism in voltage-gated sodium channels that prevents excessive firing. By analyzing a hypothetical mutation that disables this process [@problem_id:2342882], you will connect a specific molecular defect—the loss of a phosphorylation site—to a clear cellular phenotype of hyperexcitability, providing a foundational understanding of gain-of-function channelopathies.", "problem": "In the study of genetic epilepsies, many channelopathies are traced back to mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav channels). Consider a specific neuron where a particular protein kinase normally phosphorylates an intracellular loop of the Nav1.2 channel. This phosphorylation event does not alter the channel's opening or fast inactivation but is critical for promoting its entry into a state of 'slow inactivation' during periods of sustained or high-frequency neuronal depolarization. Slow inactivation is a process that reduces the pool of available channels over hundreds of milliseconds to seconds, thereby acting as a brake on excessive excitability.\n\nA patient is diagnosed with a form of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Genetic sequencing reveals a de novo point mutation in the gene encoding the Nav1.2 channel. This specific mutation prevents the regulatory phosphorylation event from occurring, without affecting any other properties of the channel.\n\nAssuming this mutation is present in an excitatory pyramidal neuron, what is the most direct and predictable physiological consequence for the neuron's firing properties compared to a normal, wild-type neuron?\n\nA. The neuron will require a much stronger depolarizing stimulus to reach the action potential threshold.\n\nB. The duration of the repolarization phase of individual action potentials will be significantly decreased.\n\nC. The neuron will be more prone to firing sustained, high-frequency bursts of action potentials in response to a depolarizing input.\n\nD. The neuron’s resting membrane potential will become stably locked at the action potential threshold value.\n\nE. The channel will be unable to conduct sodium ions, effectively preventing the neuron from firing any action potentials.", "solution": "We interpret the problem using standard gating-state principles for voltage-gated sodium channels. The Nav1.2 channel supports the action potential upstroke via opening (activation) and then rapidly stops conducting via fast inactivation on a millisecond timescale. In addition, channels can enter a distinct slow-inactivated state on a much longer timescale (hundreds of milliseconds to seconds), especially during sustained depolarization or high-frequency firing. Entry into slow inactivation reduces the pool of available channels and thus acts as a brake on excessive excitability.\n\nLet $s(t)$ denote the fraction of channels in the slow-inactivated state at time $t$, and let $f_{\\mathrm{avail}}(t)=1-s(t)$ denote the fraction of channels that remain available to open. Under a sustained depolarization $V$ in a wild-type neuron, $s(t)$ evolves approximately according to a first-order kinetic scheme\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{dt}=k_{\\mathrm{on}}(V)\\left(1-s\\right)-k_{\\mathrm{off}}(V)s,\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{on}}(V)$ is the rate of entry into slow inactivation and $k_{\\mathrm{off}}(V)$ is the rate of recovery from slow inactivation. Phosphorylation of the intracellular loop in Nav1.2 described here “promotes its entry into a state of slow inactivation,” which means it increases the effective $k_{\\mathrm{on}}(V)$ during depolarization, leading to a larger steady-state slow-inactivated fraction\n$$\ns_{\\infty}(V)=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}(V)}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}(V)+k_{\\mathrm{off}}(V)},\n$$\nand a shorter time constant\n$$\n\\tau_{S}(V)=\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}(V)+k_{\\mathrm{off}}(V)}.\n$$\nTherefore, in the wild-type condition under sustained or repetitive depolarization, $s(t)$ increases towards $s_{\\infty}(V)$, and $f_{\\mathrm{avail}}(t)=1-s(t)$ decreases over hundreds of milliseconds to seconds, reducing sodium current availability and limiting sustained firing rates.\n\nThe mutation specifically prevents the phosphorylation event without altering opening or fast inactivation. Thus, activation and fast inactivation kinetics (which determine the action potential threshold, upstroke, and the early repolarization dynamics within a single spike) are unchanged. However, removal of phosphorylation that normally promotes slow inactivation reduces the effective $k_{\\mathrm{on}}(V)$ during depolarization. As a result, for the same depolarizing input, the mutant channel exhibits a smaller $s_{\\infty}(V)$ and longer persistence of availability:\n$$\ns_{\\infty}^{\\mathrm{mut}}(V)<s_{\\infty}^{\\mathrm{WT}}(V), \\quad f_{\\mathrm{avail}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}(t)>f_{\\mathrm{avail}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}(t)\\ \\text{for sustained depolarization}.\n$$\nBecause the fraction of available channels remains higher during prolonged or high-frequency activity, the neuron can maintain larger sodium currents from spike to spike and is less subject to cumulative use-dependent reduction in excitability. Consequently, for the same depolarizing drive, the neuron becomes more prone to sustain high-frequency firing and bursts.\n\nWe now assess the options:\n- Option A predicts an increased threshold requirement. Threshold is primarily determined by activation and fast inactivation near rest, which are stated to be unchanged; thus this is not the most direct consequence.\n- Option B concerns the repolarization phase duration of individual action potentials, which depends mainly on potassium conductances and the rapid termination of sodium current via fast inactivation; since fast inactivation is unchanged and slow inactivation acts on much longer timescales, a significant shortening of repolarization is not expected.\n- Option C states the neuron will be more prone to sustained, high-frequency bursts. This follows directly from reduced slow inactivation: higher $f_{\\mathrm{avail}}(t)$ under repeated depolarizations supports sustained high-frequency firing.\n- Option D proposes a resting membrane potential locked at threshold, which is not a direct consequence of altering slow inactivation entry and is physiologically implausible here.\n- Option E posits loss of conductance entirely, contradicting the statement that opening and fast inactivation are unaffected.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and predictable physiological consequence is increased propensity for sustained, high-frequency firing in response to depolarizing input.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2342882"}, {"introduction": "Some pathogenic mutations do not merely alter a channel's normal function but create entirely new, pathological pathways for ion flow.

This movement is triggered by membrane depolarization.\n\nTo quantify the effect of this gating pore current on neuronal excitability, the researcher uses a simplified single-compartment model of a neuron.

The intracellular and extracellular environments are buffered such that the Nernst potential for protons ($H^+$) across the membrane is $E_{H^+}$.\n\nIn a simulated experiment, the neuron is initially at its resting potential. At time $t=0$, a stimulus causes a population of the mutant NaV channels to attempt activation, synchronously opening their gating pores.
