This first practice focuses on the production of the amyloid-beta ($A\\beta$) peptide, the central player in the amyloid hypothesis. You will analyze how a well-known genetic risk factor, the \"Swedish\" mutation, alters the Amyloid Precursor Protein ($APP$) to make it a more efficient substrate for the $\\beta$-secretase enzyme, providing a direct link between a change in the genetic code and the overproduction of a pathogenic molecule [@problem_id:2344422].", "problem": "In the study of Alzheimer's disease, the amyloidogenic pathway is a central focus. This pathway involves the sequential proteolytic cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), a transmembrane protein. The first cleavage is performed by the enzyme $\\beta$-secretase (also known as Beta-site APP Cleaving Enzyme 1, or BACE1), which cuts APP in its extracellular domain. This is followed by a second cleavage by the $\\gamma$-secretase complex, which releases the amyloid-beta ($A\\beta$) peptide. Certain genetic mutations are known to cause familial, early-onset Alzheimer's disease by drastically increasing the rate of $A\\beta$ production.\n\nOne of the most well-studied of these is the \"Swedish\" double mutation, located in the APP gene. This mutation changes the two amino acids immediately N-terminal to the $\\beta$-secretase cleavage site. Specifically, the wild-type Lysine-Methionine (KM) dyad at positions 670 and 671 is replaced by an Asparagine-Leucine (NL) dyad. Given this information, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct molecular explanation for why the Swedish mutation leads to increased production of $A\\beta$?\n\nA. The NL mutation causes a large-scale conformational change in the entire APP protein, making it unstable and more prone to degradation by any protease.\n\nB. The mutation is located within a regulatory region of the APP gene, leading to a significant increase in the transcription and overall expression level of the APP protein.\n\nC. The mutation alters the amino acid sequence at the cleavage site, making it a more optimal substrate for the active site of the $\\beta$-secretase enzyme, thus increasing cleavage efficiency.\n\nD. The NL amino acid sequence directly enhances the catalytic activity of the $\\gamma$-secretase complex, causing it to cleave its substrate more rapidly and frequently.\n\nE. The mutation directly upregulates the expression of the BACE1 gene, resulting in a higher concentration of the $\\beta$-secretase enzyme within the cell.", "solution": "The amyloidogenic pathway comprises two sequential proteolytic steps: first, $\\beta$-secretase (BACE1) cleaves APP in the extracellular domain to generate the C99 fragment and soluble APP$_\\beta$; second, the $\\gamma$-secretase complex cleaves C99 within the membrane to release $A\\beta$ and the APP intracellular domain. Symbolically, denote the velocities of these steps by $v_{\\beta}$ and $v_{\\gamma}$, respectively. Under Michaelis–Menten kinetics for the $\\beta$-secretase step,\n$$\nv_{\\beta}=\\frac{k_{cat,\\beta}[E_{\\beta}][APP]}{K_{M,\\beta}+[APP]},\n$$\nwhere $E_{\\beta}$ denotes BACE1, $k_{cat,\\beta}$ is the catalytic constant, and $K_{M,\\beta}$ is the Michaelis constant reflecting enzyme–substrate affinity at the cleavage site. The steady-state flux to $A\\beta$ depends on the formation rate of the C99 intermediate and its subsequent processing; increasing $v_{\\beta}$ increases the supply of C99 and thereby raises the $A\\beta$ production rate provided downstream processing is not completely saturated. In practical terms, increasing the specificity constant $\\frac{k_{cat,\\beta}}{K_{M,\\beta}}$ increases flux toward $A\\beta$.\n\nThe Swedish double mutation changes the two residues immediately N-terminal to the $\\beta$-secretase scissile bond from Lys-Met (KM) to Asn-Leu (NL), i.e., at the positions that BACE1 recognizes for substrate binding and cleavage. This directly alters the local sequence determinants at the $\\beta$-site, making APP a better substrate for BACE1 by increasing $k_{cat,\\beta}$, decreasing $K_{M,\\beta}$, or both, thus increasing $\\frac{k_{cat,\\beta}}{K_{M,\\beta}}$ and consequently $v_{\\beta}$ and $A\\beta$ production.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because a global conformational destabilization and nonspecific proteolysis is neither necessary nor the observed mechanism; the effect is site-specific at the $\\beta$-cleavage site.\n- Option B is incorrect because the mutation lies in the coding region near the cleavage site, not in a transcriptional regulatory region; it does not primarily increase APP expression.\n- Option C is correct because the mutation directly improves the match between the APP $\\beta$-site and the BACE1 active-site specificity, increasing cleavage efficiency and flux to $A\\beta$ via an increased $\\frac{k_{cat,\\beta}}{K_{M,\\beta}}$.\n- Option D is incorrect because the mutation alters the substrate for $\\beta$-secretase, not the catalytic properties of the $\\gamma$-secretase enzyme.\n- Option E is incorrect because the mutation does not directly regulate BACE1 gene expression; it changes the substrate sequence.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and direct molecular explanation is that the NL substitution at the $\\beta$-site increases BACE1 cleavage efficiency of APP, thereby increasing $A\\beta$ production.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2344422"}, {"introduction": "Following its production, the $A\\beta$ peptide's tendency to self-assemble into toxic oligomers and fibrils is the next critical step in the disease cascade.
