In this practice [@problem_id:2351012], you will apply this model quantitatively to see how the duration of these 'stop' and 'go' phases reconcile the vast difference between instantaneous motor speed and average transport velocity.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the mechanism of slow axonal transport, a process crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of a nerve cell's axon. They focus on Slow Component b (SCb), which is responsible for moving cytoskeletal proteins like tubulin. The \"stop-and-go\" model of slow transport proposes that individual tubulin dimers do not move continuously. Instead, they are thought to undergo short periods of rapid, motor-driven movement along existing microtubule tracks (the \"go\" phase), separated by much longer periods where they are untracked and diffuse freely within the axoplasm (the \"stop\" phase).\n\nAssume the following average parameters have been determined for tubulin transport in a specific type of neuron:\n1.  The overall, time-averaged net transport velocity of the tubulin population, $v_{avg} = 3.00$ mm/day.\n2.  The instantaneous velocity of a single tubulin dimer when it is being actively carried by a kinesin motor along a microtubule track, $v_{motor} = 1.20$ µm/s.\n3.

The key idea is to relate the observed average velocity, $v_{avg}$, to the instantaneous motor velocity, $v_{motor}$.\n\nThe average velocity is the total displacement achieved during active transport, averaged over the total time (both \"go\" and \"stop\" phases). Let $f_{on}$ be the fraction of time a tubulin dimer spends in the active \"go\" phase and $f_{off}$ be the fraction of time it spends in the diffusive \"stop\" phase. By definition, $f_{on} + f_{off} = 1$.\n\nThe average velocity can be expressed as a weighted average of the velocities during the two phases:\n$$v_{avg} = f_{on} \\cdot v_{motor} + f_{off} \\cdot v_{stop}$$\nAs stated in the problem, the net displacement during the \"stop\" phase is zero, so $v_{stop} = 0$.
