The number of repeats determines the clinical outcome. The classification of *HTT* alleles is as follows:\n- Normal alleles: Fewer than 27 $\\text{CAG}$ repeats.\n- Intermediate alleles: 27 to 35 $\\text{CAG}$ repeats. Individuals with these alleles do not develop the disease but have an increased risk of having children with an expanded, disease-causing allele.\n- Reduced-penetrance alleles: 36 to 39 $\\text{CAG}$ repeats.

Denote the full-penetrance allele as $F$ (42 repeats) and the normal allele as $N$ (15 repeats), so the genotype is $N/F$. The partner has two normal alleles with 18 and 23 repeats, which we denote collectively as normal alleles $N$, so the partner’s genotype is $N/N$.\n\nUnder simple Mendelian inheritance with stable repeat numbers and equal segregation, each parent contributes one allele to the child with equal probability from their two alleles. Therefore, the gametes from the $N/F$ parent are $N$ and $F$ with probabilities\n$$\nP(G_{1}=N)=\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(G_{1}=F)=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThe partner’s gametes are both normal, so\n$$\nP(G_{2}=\\text{normal})=1.\n$$\n\nA child will possess at least one full-penetrance allele if and only if it inherits the $F$ allele from the $N/F$ parent, because the partner has no full-penetrance alleles to contribute.

This exercise presents a thought experiment that challenges you to apply the molecular concept of a toxic gain-of-function to predict a clinical outcome. By comparing a typical heterozygous individual to a rare homozygous case [@problem_id:2343297], you can explore how the quantity of the mutant huntingtin protein, not just its presence, correlates with disease severity.", "problem": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of a $\\text{CAG}$ trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. This expansion leads to an abnormally long polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein, making it toxic to neurons. The number of repeats correlates with disease onset and severity. The normal range is fewer than 27 repeats. Alleles with 40 or more repeats are fully penetrant, meaning individuals with such an allele will develop the disease.\n\nA typical individual with HD is heterozygous, possessing one normal allele (e.g., 20 repeats) and one expanded, disease-causing allele (e.g., 45 repeats). Consider a rare clinical case where an individual is found to be homozygous for the expanded allele, possessing two copies of the allele with 45 $\\text{CAG}$ repeats.\n\nBased on the molecular mechanism of a toxic gain-of-function, which of the following predictions about the clinical presentation of the homozygous individual (45/45 repeats) is the most likely when compared to a typical heterozygous patient (20/45 repeats)?\n\nA. The disease severity and age of onset would be identical, as the pathogenic repeat length of 45 is the sole determinant of the phenotype.\n\nB. The disease would be significantly milder, as the absence of the normal huntingtin protein allows for a more stable cellular environment.\n\nC. The disease would be more severe, with a potentially earlier age of onset, due to an increased dosage of the toxic protein.\n\nD. The individual would be completely asymptomatic because homozygosity for a pathogenic HD allele is known to be embryonically lethal.\n\nE. The disease severity would be equivalent to that of a hypothetical heterozygote with one normal allele and one allele with 90 repeats.", "solution": "1) State the molecular mechanism. Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by an expanded $\\text{CAG}$ repeat in the HTT gene that encodes an abnormally long polyglutamine tract in huntingtin. This produces a toxic gain-of-function of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) that aggregates and damages neurons. Thus, pathogenesis depends on the presence and amount (dosage) of toxic mHTT protein.\n\n2) Relate repeat length and penetrance. Larger $\\text{CAG}$ repeat lengths correlate with earlier age of onset and increased severity. Alleles with at least 40 repeats are fully penetrant. However, the repeat length on each allele is not the only determinant; the total dosage of toxic protein also matters because expression from both alleles contributes to the cellular burden of mHTT.\n\n3) Apply gene-dosage logic to heterozygote versus homozygote. Let each HTT allele be expressed at an average rate $r$ of protein production. In a typical heterozygote (normal/mutant, e.g., $20/45$ repeats), the cell produces approximately $r$ units of normal HTT and $r$ units of mHTT. In a homozygote for the expanded allele (e.g., $45/45$), the cell produces approximately $2r$ units of mHTT and $0$ units of normal HTT. Because toxicity is driven by the mHTT species (toxic gain-of-function), increasing the amount of mHTT from $r$ to $2r$ increases the toxic burden, which is expected to worsen disease severity and shift onset earlier, assuming other modifiers are held constant.\n\n4) Consider the role of normal HTT. Normal HTT has important cellular functions; its absence does not stabilize the system. The key driver in HD is the toxic gain-of-function of mHTT rather than simple loss-of-function. Therefore, replacing normal HTT with additional mHTT (as in homozygosity for the expanded allele) would not be expected to ameliorate disease; it would increase toxicity.\n\n5) Empirical expectation. Rare reported homozygous HD cases generally show earlier age of onset and more severe disease than matched heterozygotes with the same expanded repeat length, consistent with a dosage effect of toxic protein.\n\n6) Evaluate options:\n- A is incorrect: repeat length is a major determinant but not the sole determinant; gene dosage (number of mutant alleles) also influences phenotype.\n- B is incorrect: absence of normal HTT is not beneficial; the key mechanism is toxic gain-of-function, and doubling mHTT increases toxicity.\n- C is correct: more mHTT (two mutant alleles) implies higher toxic burden and likely earlier onset/more severe disease.\n- D is incorrect: homozygosity for a pathogenic HD allele is not known to be embryonically lethal; adult homozygotes have been reported.\n- E is incorrect: a heterozygote with $90$ repeats typically has juvenile-onset HD and a far more severe course than a $45/45$ homozygote; $45/45$ is not equivalent to $20/90$.\n\nTherefore, the most likely prediction is that the disease would be more severe with potentially earlier onset due to increased toxic protein dosage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2343297"}, {"introduction": "Scientific hypotheses must be tested with empirical evidence, and this practice places you in the role of a researcher analyzing experimental data.
