This exercise [@problem_id:2348610] explores the role of N-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum, not just as an addition of sugar moieties, but as a critical requirement for proper protein folding and trafficking. By analyzing a mutation that abolishes a glycosylation site on a hypothetical potassium channel, you will practice applying the principles of cellular quality control to predict the consequences for the protein's journey to the plasma membrane.", "problem": "Neuroscientists are studying a newly discovered voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, which they have named Kv-Zeta. The wild-type protein functions as part of a channel complex in the neuronal plasma membrane. Genetic analysis reveals that the extracellular domain of the Kv-Zeta polypeptide contains a consensus sequence (Asn-X-Ser) for N-linked glycosylation. To investigate the role of this post-translational modification, a mutant version of the Kv-Zeta gene is created in which the asparagine (Asn) residue at the core of this site is replaced with a glutamine (Gln) residue. This specific mutation prevents the attachment of any oligosaccharide chain at this location. The mutant gene is then expressed in a cultured neuron.\n\nBased on the known principles of protein synthesis, folding, and trafficking for membrane proteins, what is the most likely fate and functional consequence for the mutant Kv-Zeta protein?\n\nA. The mutant protein will be fully synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytoplasm but will be immediately ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome because it lacks the signal for entry into the secretory pathway.\n\nB. The mutant protein will be correctly inserted into the plasma membrane and will form functional channels, but these channels will have an altered sensitivity to extracellular pH compared to the wild-type channels.\n\nC. The mutant protein will enter the endoplasmic reticulum but will fail to fold into its correct three-dimensional conformation. It will be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently targeted for proteolytic degradation, preventing its arrival at the plasma membrane.\n\nD. The mutant protein will fold correctly and be transported to the plasma membrane, but it will be unable to assemble with other channel subunits, remaining as a non-functional monomer in the membrane.\n\nE. The mutant protein will be incorrectly sorted in the trans-Golgi network and delivered to the lysosomal membrane, where it will be rapidly degraded by lysosomal proteases.", "solution": "The extracellular domain of a type I plasma membrane protein is topologically equivalent to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen during biosynthesis. N-linked glycosylation occurs co-translationally in the ER lumen when the enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase transfers a preassembled oligosaccharide from a dolichol phosphate carrier to the amide nitrogen of an asparagine residue in the consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X is any residue except proline). Replacing Asn with Gln at this site abolishes N-linked glycosylation at that position, because glutamine cannot serve as an acceptor.\n\nTargeting and synthesis: Integral membrane proteins contain signal sequences and transmembrane segments that are recognized by the signal recognition particle, leading to co-translational insertion into the rough ER membrane. Loss of an N-glycosylation site does not eliminate the signal sequence or transmembrane topology signals. Therefore, synthesis still occurs on membrane-bound ribosomes with ER targeting, contradicting any prediction of exclusive synthesis on free ribosomes and immediate cytosolic proteasomal degradation on that basis; this rules out option A.\n\nFolding and ER quality control: In the ER, nascent glycoproteins utilize the calnexin/calreticulin cycle, which specifically recognizes monoglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides. This glycan-dependent chaperone pathway promotes correct folding and prevents premature exit. Loss of the N-glycan at the extracellular domain reduces or abolishes engagement with this quality control system at that site, commonly resulting in misfolding or failure to attain a transport-competent conformation. Misfolded or incompletely folded proteins are retained in the ER by quality control mechanisms (including BiP and the calnexin/calreticulin cycle) and are subsequently targeted for ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which involves retrotranslocation to the cytosol, ubiquitination, and degradation by the proteasome. Thus, the most likely fate is ER retention and degradation, preventing delivery to the plasma membrane, matching option C’s description of ER retention and subsequent degradation.\n\nExclusion of other options:\n- Option B posits correct trafficking and function with altered pH sensitivity. While glycans can modulate extracellular interactions, the canonical and most likely consequence of removing a critical N-glycan in a newly characterized channel subunit is impaired folding/ER quality control rather than preserved function with subtle gating changes.\n- Option D claims correct folding and trafficking but failed assembly at the plasma membrane. Glycosylation primarily aids folding and quality control; a complete loss at a conserved site more commonly blocks ER exit rather than allowing trafficking to the membrane as a nonfunctional monomer.\n- Option E suggests missorting to lysosomes via the trans-Golgi network. Sorting to lysosomes relies on specific signals (for soluble hydrolases, mannose-6-phosphate; for membrane proteins, defined cytosolic sorting motifs), not on the mere absence of an N-glycan on a plasma membrane protein. Therefore, lysosomal delivery and degradation are not the expected outcome.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of ER co-translational insertion, N-linked glycosylation, ER quality control, and ERAD, the mutant Kv-Zeta protein most likely fails to fold properly, is retained in the ER, and is degraded, preventing surface expression and channel function, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2348610"}, {"introduction": "The function of a cell is often dictated by the precise amount of active proteins, a level that is dynamically regulated by a balance of synthesis and degradation. This practice [@problem_id:2348554] delves into the regulatory tug-of-war between ubiquitination, which marks proteins for destruction, and de-ubiquitination, which grants them a reprieve. You are challenged to predict how disrupting this balance for a single protein involved in mitochondrial fusion impacts the entire mitochondrial network, illustrating the direct link between a molecular PTM switch and a large-scale cellular phenotype.", "problem": "The dynamic morphology of mitochondria is governed by a delicate balance between fusion, the merging of individual mitochondria into elongated networks, and fission, the division of mitochondria into smaller units. Mitofusin 2 (MFN2) is a key protein located on the outer mitochondrial membrane that is essential for promoting mitochondrial fusion. The cellular concentration of MFN2 is, in part, regulated by post-translational modification. Specifically, the attachment of ubiquitin protein tags to MFN2 marks it for degradation by the proteasome, a cellular machinery for protein disposal. This ubiquitination is counteracted by a class of enzymes known as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which remove ubiquitin tags to stabilize their target proteins.\n\nImagine a newly identified, neuron-specific DUB, which we shall call DUB-N1. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the sole function of DUB-N1 is to remove ubiquitin tags from MFN2, thereby protecting it from degradation. A research team develops a mouse model with a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding DUB-N1.\n\nWhat is the most likely mitochondrial morphology observed in neurons cultured from these mutant mice when compared to neurons from wild-type mice?\n\nA. Fragmented mitochondria, characterized by an abundance of small, punctate, and disconnected organelles.\n\nB. Hyperfused mitochondria, characterized by abnormally long and highly interconnected mitochondrial networks.\n\nC. No significant change in mitochondrial morphology, with the network appearing structurally similar to that in wild-type neurons.\n\nD. A significant increase in the total number of mitochondria per cell, but with each mitochondrion retaining its normal size and shape.\n\nE. Aggregated mitochondria, where organelles clump together in the perinuclear region but do not fuse into a network.", "solution": "The governing principle is that mitochondrial morphology reflects the balance between fusion and fission. MFN2 is an essential outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase that promotes mitochondrial fusion; decreasing MFN2 function shifts the balance toward fission, yielding fragmented mitochondria.\n\nUbiquitination targets MFN2 for proteasomal degradation, thereby reducing its abundance and decreasing fusion capacity. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) remove ubiquitin from target proteins, stabilizing them and increasing their steady-state levels. By premise, DUB-N1 is neuron-specific and its sole function is to deubiquitinate MFN2, thereby protecting MFN2 from degradation.\n\nIn a homozygous loss-of-function mutation of the DUB-N1 gene, DUB-N1 activity is absent. Without DUB-N1, MFN2 remains ubiquitinated and is more efficiently degraded by the proteasome. This decreases MFN2 protein levels, reduces mitochondrial fusion activity, and thus shifts the fusion–fission balance toward fission.\n\nThe morphological outcome of increased fission and reduced fusion is a fragmented mitochondrial network, characterized by numerous small, punctate, and disconnected mitochondria.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A matches the expected phenotype (fragmented mitochondria due to reduced MFN2-mediated fusion).\n- B would require increased MFN2 stabilization and enhanced fusion, which is the opposite of the predicted effect.\n- C is unlikely because the sole function of DUB-N1 directly affects MFN2 stability and thus morphology.\n- D is inconsistent: increased numbers with normal size/shape would not reflect the fusion deficit; fission-biased states typically yield smaller, punctate mitochondria.\n- E (perinuclear aggregation without fusion) is more characteristic of transport or cytoskeletal defects, not specifically of reduced MFN2-mediated fusion.\n\nTherefore, the most likely morphology is fragmented mitochondria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2348554"}, {"introduction": "A central question in neuroscience is how transient stimuli can create stable, long-lasting memories at the molecular level. This advanced problem [@problem_id:2348612] presents a powerful conceptual model where the interplay between different PTM-related processes can store information over time. You will use kinetic principles to analyze a system where a protein flips between an inactive state, $X$, and a phosphorylated active state, $X_p$, while only the inactive form is targeted for slow degradation, thereby creating a long-lived molecular memory. This exercise builds skill in mathematical modeling to understand how the dynamics of post-translational modifications can give rise to complex biological functions like memory persistence.", "problem": "A crucial synaptic scaffolding protein, which we will call protein X, is a key molecular player in the storage of long-term memories. This protein exists in two distinct states: an active, phosphorylated form, denoted as $X_p$, and an inactive, dephosphorylated form, denoted as $X$. The transitions between these states are governed by first-order kinetics. The phosphorylation of $X$ to form $X_p$ is driven by a kinase with an effective rate constant $k_{kin}$, while the reverse dephosphorylation of $X_p$ back to $X$ is catalyzed by a phosphatase with a rate constant $k_{phos}$.\n\nIn addition to this dynamic cycle, the protein is subject to slow, constitutive degradation. A critical feature of this system is that proteolysis only targets the inactive, dephosphorylated form, $X$. This irreversible degradation process also follows first-order kinetics, characterized by a rate constant $k_{deg}$. All three rate constants, $k_{kin}$, $k_{phos}$, and $k_{deg}$, are positive and have units of inverse time.\n\nConsider a scenario immediately following a strong synaptic stimulus that induces Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a cellular mechanism for memory formation. At this point, which we define as time $t=0$, the kinase activity has reached a new, elevated steady state, and the total amount of protein X (sum of both $X$ and $X_p$ forms) within the synapse is $N_0$. A key aspect of this biological system is the separation of timescales: the enzymatic phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is significantly faster than the protein degradation process, meaning $k_{kin} \\gg k_{deg}$ and $k_{phos} \\gg k_{deg}$.\n\nThe persistence of the active form, $X_p$, is considered the molecular trace of the memory. Determine an expression for the time, $t_{1/e}$, at which the amount of the active protein $X_p$ has decayed to $1/e$ (approximately 36.8%) of its initial amount at $t=0$. Your final answer should be an expression for this characteristic decay time in terms of the rate constants $k_{kin}$, $k_{phos}$, and $k_{deg}$.", "solution": "Let $X$ denote the inactive form and $X_{p}$ the active phosphorylated form.
