This exercise provides a foundational calculation of transport times for both anterograde and retrograde pathways over a significant distance. By working through this scenario [@problem_id:2328022], you will gain a tangible sense of the impressive efficiency and the absolute time demands of the fast axonal transport system that keeps our longest cells alive and functional.", "problem": "A scientist is studying the cellular logistics within a primary sensory neuron, specifically a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron. The axon of this neuron extends from the lower back to the foot, covering a total distance of $L = 1.0$ meter. For the axon terminal to function correctly, a protein complex must be synthesized in the cell body and transported to the terminal. This process occurs via fast anterograde transport at a constant rate of $v_{ant} = 400$ mm/day. Once at the terminal, the neuron takes up a critical growth factor, which is then transported back to the cell body to signal that the neuron is properly connected. This return journey happens via fast retrograde transport at a constant rate of $v_{ret} = 200$ mm/day.\n\nCalculate the minimum total time required for this entire round-trip signaling process, which begins when the protein complex departs from the cell body and ends when the growth factor arrives back at the cell body. Express your answer in days, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The process consists of two sequential transports along the same axonal length: anterograde from the cell body to the terminal and retrograde back to the cell body. The governing relation for constant-speed transport is time equals distance divided by speed.\n\nConvert the axon length to consistent units. Since the speeds are given in millimeters per day, use millimeters for distance:\n$$\nL = 1.0 \\text{ m} = 1000 \\text{ mm}.\n$$\n\nCompute the anterograde transport time using $t = \\frac{L}{v}$:\n$$\nt_{\\text{ant}} = \\frac{1000}{400} = 2.5 \\text{ days}.\n$$\n\nCompute the retrograde transport time:\n$$\nt_{\\text{ret}} = \\frac{1000}{200} = 5 \\text{ days}.\n$$\n\nThe total round-trip time is the sum:\n$$\nt_{\\text{total}} = t_{\\text{ant}} + t_{\\text{ret}} = 2.5 + 5 = 7.5 \\text{ days}.\n$$\n\nRounded to two significant figures, the result remains $7.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.5}$$", "id": "2328022"}, {"introduction": "The axonal transport system is a two-way highway, with specific motor proteins governing traffic in each direction. This problem presents a thought experiment where the machinery for the return journey, driven by the motor protein dynein, is selectively disabled. By predicting the consequences of this failure [@problem_id:2328051], you can solidify your understanding of retrograde transport's critical role in cellular recycling and signaling, a concept fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of many neurodegenerative disorders.", "problem": "In a neuron, cellular components are actively moved along the axon in a process called axonal transport. This transport occurs along microtubule tracks, which are polarized structures. Motor proteins known as kinesins are responsible for anterograde transport, moving cargo from the cell body (soma) towards the axon terminal (the plus-end of the microtubule). Conversely, motor proteins called dyneins are responsible for retrograde transport, moving cargo from the axon terminal back to the cell body (the minus-end of the microtubule). This retrograde pathway is crucial for recycling used components and for transmitting survival signals from the synapse back to the soma.\n\nConsider a hypothetical neurological disorder caused by a specific genetic mutation that renders the cytoplasmic dynein motor protein completely non-functional. Assume that the kinesin motor proteins and the microtubule structures themselves remain entirely unaffected by this mutation.\n\nWhich of the following would be the most direct and primary consequence of this specific defect in the neuron?\n\nA. A rapid depletion of mitochondria and synaptic vesicle precursors at the axon terminal.\n\nB. The accumulation of misfolded proteins and aged organelles at the distal end of the axon.\n\nC. A complete disassembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton throughout the neuron.\n\nD. An inability of the neuron to generate or propagate action potentials along the axon.\n\nE. The blockage of anterograde transport due to a traffic jam created by stalled retrograde cargo.", "solution": "We use the established polarity of axonal microtubules and motor directionality. In axons, microtubules are polarized with their plus-ends oriented toward the axon terminal and their minus-ends toward the soma. Kinesin family motors drive anterograde transport from soma to terminal along plus-end direction, while cytoplasmic dynein drives retrograde transport from terminal to soma along minus-end direction.\n\nGiven the mutation renders dynein completely non-functional, retrograde transport is abolished, while anterograde transport remains intact because kinesins and microtubules are unaffected. Therefore:\n1) Cargoes that normally require retrograde transport (e.g., aged or damaged organelles such as mitochondria designated for turnover, autophagosomes containing misfolded or aggregated proteins, and signaling endosomes carrying neurotrophic signals) will not return to the soma.\n2) The immediate and primary effect will be distal accumulation of such retrograde cargo at the axon terminal and along distal axon segments.\n3) Anterograde delivery of mitochondria and synaptic vesicle precursors will continue because kinesin function is intact; thus, depletion at the terminal is not expected as a primary effect.\n4) The microtubule cytoskeleton is stated to be unaffected by the mutation, so disassembly is not a direct consequence.\n5) Action potential generation and propagation are electrophysiological processes dependent on ion channels and membrane properties; they do not directly require dynein, so there is no immediate failure in excitability as a primary effect.\n6) Although secondary crowding could occur over time, a primary and most direct effect is the accumulation of retrograde cargo distally, not an immediate blockade of anterograde transport.\n\nEvaluating options:\n- A is incorrect because anterograde transport is intact; depletion would require impaired kinesin.\n- B is correct: misfolded proteins and aged organelles would accumulate at the distal axon due to loss of retrograde transport.\n- C is incorrect because microtubules are explicitly unaffected.\n- D is incorrect as a primary effect; action potential conduction is not directly impaired by dynein loss.\n- E is not the most direct primary effect; any anterograde impairment would be secondary and delayed, whereas distal accumulation happens directly from loss of dynein-driven retrograde movement.\n\nThus, the most direct and primary consequence is the distal accumulation of retrograde cargo.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2328051"}, {"introduction": "While fast transport moves organelles and vesicles, the structural and metabolic proteins of the axon itself move at a much more deliberate pace via slow axonal transport.
