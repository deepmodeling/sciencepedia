A thin slice of hippocampal tissue is prepared and maintained in an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) that mimics the brain's extracellular environment. An electrode is used to stimulate a bundle of axons known as the Schaffer collaterals, an axon tract in the hippocampus that connects neurons in the CA3 region to neurons in the CA1 region. A second microelectrode records the resulting Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP), a postsynaptic potential that makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential, from a single CA1 pyramidal neuron.\n\nIn a typical experiment, applying a sustained low-frequency stimulation (LFS) of 1 Hz to the Schaffer collaterals does not cause a lasting change in the strength of the synapse, as measured by the amplitude of the EPSP.\n\nThe researcher then conducts a new experiment. They replace the standard aCSF with a modified version that is identical in every way except that it contains no magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$). With the hippocampal slice bathed in this $Mg^{2+}$-free solution, the researcher again applies the same LFS protocol (1 Hz stimulation) to the Schaffer collaterals.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is most likely to be observed in the strength of the CA3-CA1 synapse in this new experiment?\n\nA. No change in synaptic strength, as LFS is inherently insufficient to induce long-term plasticity.\n\nB. A long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength, also known as Long-Term Depression (LTD).\n\nC.

A brief, transient increase in synaptic strength that returns to baseline within minutes.", "solution": "We analyze how low-frequency stimulation (LFS) interacts with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function and intracellular calcium signaling to determine the direction of long-term synaptic plasticity.\n\nFirst, long-term synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA1 synapses depends on postsynaptic calcium influx primarily through NMDARs. The qualitative calcium control hypothesis states:\n- If the postsynaptic calcium elevation per induction event satisfies $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}} \\geq \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$, kinase-dominant signaling (e.g., CaMKII) is engaged, yielding long-term potentiation (LTP).\n- If $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}} \\leq \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}} < \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$, phosphatase-dominant signaling is engaged, yielding long-term depression (LTD).\n- If $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}} < \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}}$, no long-term plasticity occurs.\n\nSecond, the NMDAR current under physiological magnesium is voltage dependent due to a magnesium block. A standard phenomenological form for the NMDAR current is\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V_m,[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]) = g_{\\max} \\, P_{\\mathrm{open}} \\, S(V_m,[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]) \\, (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}),\n$$\nwhere $g_{\\max}$ is the maximal conductance, $P_{\\mathrm{open}}$ reflects glutamate binding/gating, and $S$ captures the relief of the magnesium block. A common form for the magnesium block factor is\n$$\nS(V_m,[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\beta \\,[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] \\, \\exp(-\\gamma V_m)},\n$$\nwith $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ positive constants. Under standard aCSF, at resting or weakly depolarized potentials during LFS, $S$ is small due to the presence of $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]>0$, so $I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$ and the associated calcium influx are limited. Consequently, for 1 Hz LFS in standard aCSF, $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ usually does not exceed $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$, and often does not reliably exceed $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}}$, yielding no lasting change.\n\nThird, in $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]=0$ aCSF, the magnesium block is removed:\n$$\nS(V_m,0) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\beta \\cdot 0 \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma V_m)} = 1,\n$$\nso\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V_m,0) = g_{\\max} \\, P_{\\mathrm{open}} \\, (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}),\n$$\nwhich is no longer constrained by voltage-dependent block. Therefore, even at resting or modestly depolarized $V_m$ produced by 1 Hz LFS, NMDARs pass substantially more current, including calcium. This increases $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ per stimulus.\n\nFourth, compare the altered calcium influx to the plasticity thresholds. Removal of the magnesium block increases NMDAR-mediated calcium entry for each LFS pulse. Thus the effective $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is shifted upward. Under these conditions, the same 1 Hz stimulation that previously yielded subthreshold calcium is now likely to satisfy\n$$\n\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}} \\geq \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}},\n$$\nfavoring kinase-dominant signaling (e.g., CaMKII autophosphorylation) that increases AMPA receptor conductance and/or number at the postsynaptic density, yielding a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength (LTP).\n\nFinally, evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because the sufficiency of LFS is altered by removing the magnesium block; LFS is no longer inherently insufficient.\n- B is unlikely because LTD typically arises when calcium is modest and below $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$, but removing magnesium increases calcium and biases toward LTP.\n- C is supported by the mechanism above: unblocking NMDARs at rest allows LFS to induce LTP.\n- D is not the most likely outcome for the described protocol; while $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]=0$ can predispose tissue to hyperexcitability, the question concerns the synaptic strength outcome under LFS, for which LTP is the canonical observation rather than rapid, permanent silencing.\n- E describes a short-term effect; the calcium-dependent NMDAR pathway described supports a long-lasting change consistent with LTP, not merely a transient facilitation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength (LTP).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341381"}, {"introduction": "Once the NMDA receptor's channel is unblocked, it allows ion flow that triggers LTP.

They are using an in-vitro slice preparation to study Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting enhancement in signal transmission between two neurons, at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse. The strength of the synapse is quantified by measuring the amplitude of the Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) in a postsynaptic CA1 neuron in response to stimulation of the presynaptic Schaffer collateral axons.\n\nThe standard experimental protocol involves two phases:\n1.  A baseline period where single, low-frequency electrical pulses are delivered to the presynaptic axons, and the resulting baseline EPSP amplitude is recorded from the postsynaptic neuron.\n2.  An induction phase where a brief, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) tetanus is delivered to the presynaptic axons.\n3.  A post-induction period where the same low-frequency pulses from the baseline period are resumed, and the EPSP amplitude is recorded to see if it has been potentiated.\n\nThe researcher conducts two experiments. In Experiment 1 (Control), they follow the standard protocol and observe a robust and stable potentiation of the EPSP amplitude following HFS. In Experiment 2 (Treatment), they repeat the entire protocol, but with one critical modification: before the baseline period begins, the specific postsynaptic CA1 neuron being recorded from is loaded with BAPTA (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid), a molecule that rapidly binds to and sequesters free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$), acting as a \"calcium chelator\". The presynaptic terminal and all other cells remain unaltered.\n\nAssuming the canonical model of N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent LTP, which of the following outcomes is the most likely result for Experiment 2?\n\nA. The HFS will fail to induce LTP, and the post-induction EPSP amplitude will be approximately the same as the baseline EPSP amplitude.\n\nB. The HFS will induce an even stronger and more robust form of LTP compared to the control experiment.\n\nC. The BAPTA will have no effect, and the magnitude of LTP observed will be identical to that in the control experiment.\n\nD. The BAPTA will block all synaptic transmission, causing the EPSP to be absent even during the baseline recording period before the HFS.\n\nE. The HFS will fail to induce LTP because BAPTA prevents neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal.", "solution": "1. In the canonical NMDA receptor-dependent LTP model, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) produces strong synaptic depolarization that relieves the voltage-dependent $Mg^{2+}$ block of NMDA receptors, allowing postsynaptic $Ca^{2+}$ influx through the NMDA receptor channel.\n2. The resulting rise in postsynaptic free $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ serves as a necessary trigger for activating $Ca^{2+}$-dependent signaling cascades (e.g., CaMKII), which increase AMPA receptor function and/or number at the postsynaptic density, thereby increasing the EPSP amplitude after induction.\n3. In the control experiment, these processes occur, producing a robust and stable potentiation of the EPSP following HFS, consistent with NMDA receptor-dependent LTP.\n4. In the treatment experiment, only the recorded postsynaptic CA1 neuron is loaded with BAPTA, a fast, high-affinity $Ca^{2+}$ chelator that binds free $Ca^{2+}$ and thereby reduces the amplitude and duration of the free postsynaptic $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ transient.\n5. Because the induction of NMDA receptor-dependent LTP requires a sufficient postsynaptic free $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ elevation, buffering $Ca^{2+}$ with BAPTA prevents the $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ from reaching the threshold necessary to activate the downstream kinases and structural processes that underlie LTP expression.\n6. Baseline synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses is mediated primarily by AMPA receptors and does not require a postsynaptic rise in $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$. Loading BAPTA into the postsynaptic neuron does not block AMPA receptor-mediated currents; thus, baseline EPSPs remain present and comparable to control.\n7. Neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal depends on presynaptic $Ca^{2+}$ entry via voltage-gated $Ca^{2+}$ channels. Because only the postsynaptic neuron is loaded with BAPTA, presynaptic release mechanisms are unaffected.\n8. Therefore, HFS in the BAPTA-loaded postsynaptic neuron fails to induce LTP, and the post-induction EPSP amplitude remains approximately at the baseline level. This outcome corresponds to option A and excludes the alternatives: stronger LTP (B), no effect (C), blockade of all transmission (D), or impaired presynaptic release (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2341419"}, {"introduction": "We have established that a postsynaptic calcium rise is the key trigger for LTP. However, the nervous system also needs to weaken synapses through Long-Term Depression (LTD). This final practice explores how the cell deciphers the calcium signal, revealing that the dynamics of the $Ca^{2+}$ influx—whether it is a large, rapid spike or a modest, sustained elevation—determines the direction of synaptic change [@problem_id:2341416]. This exercise illuminates the sophisticated mechanism by which different patterns of activity can either strengthen or weaken synaptic connections.", "problem": "In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, is crucial for learning and memory. Two primary forms are Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting enhancement in signal transmission, and Long-Term Depression (LTD), a long-lasting reduction in synaptic efficacy. Both processes are typically dependent on the influx of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the postsynaptic neuron. High-frequency stimulation (e.g., 100 Hz) leads to a large, rapid influx of $Ca^{2+}$ and induces LTP. In contrast, prolonged low-frequency stimulation (LFS) of presynaptic neurons (e.g., 1-5 Hz) typically induces LTD.\n\nWhich of the following statements best explains the molecular basis for why LFS induces LTD rather than LTP?\n\nA. LFS causes a large and rapid influx of $Ca^{2+}$, which strongly activates protein kinases like CaMKII. These kinases phosphorylate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, leading to their insertion into the postsynaptic membrane.\n\nB. LFS causes a modest and prolonged increase in postsynaptic $Ca^{2+}$ concentration. This level of calcium is sufficient to activate protein phosphatases (e.g., calcineurin), which dephosphorylate AMPA receptors and other substrates, promoting their removal from the synaptic membrane.\n\nC. LFS causes a modest and prolonged increase in postsynaptic $Ca^{2+}$ concentration, which is the ideal condition for activating protein kinases like PKA and CaMKII, leading to a long-term decrease in synaptic strength.\n\nD. LFS leads to the depletion of presynaptic neurotransmitter vesicles, meaning that for a long period, less glutamate is released in response to an action potential, which is the definition of LTD.\n\nE. LFS selectively activates metabotropic glutamate receptors instead of NMDA receptors, triggering a secondary messenger cascade that is completely independent of calcium and leads to the internalization of AMPA receptors.", "solution": "We proceed by linking stimulation frequency to postsynaptic calcium dynamics, calcium-dependent enzyme activation, and downstream synaptic expression mechanisms.\n\nFirst, prolonged low-frequency stimulation (LFS; for example, 1 to 5 Hz) produces a modest but sustained postsynaptic influx of $Ca^{2+}$ through NMDA receptors. The key principle is that the amplitude and time course of the $Ca^{2+}$ signal determine which downstream enzymes are preferentially activated. High, rapid $Ca^{2+}$ transients favor activation of protein kinases such as CaMKII, whereas lower, prolonged $Ca^{2+}$ elevations preferentially activate calcium-dependent protein phosphatases, notably calcineurin (also known as PP2B), which in turn can recruit PP1.\n\nSecond, with LFS the modest, prolonged $Ca^{2+}$ elevation is sufficient to activate calcineurin via calmodulin. Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates targets, including inhibitor-1, thereby disinhibiting PP1. The net effect is a dominance of phosphatase activity over kinase activity under these calcium conditions. In contrast, CaMKII typically requires higher, more transient $Ca^{2+}$ peaks to achieve robust activation and autophosphorylation, conditions characteristic of high-frequency stimulation that produces LTP rather than LTD.\n\nThird, the downstream expression of LTD in CA1 commonly involves dephosphorylation of AMPA receptor subunits and associated scaffold/adaptor proteins, which promotes clathrin-mediated endocytosis of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane. This reduces synaptic AMPA receptor number and/or conductance, leading to a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength, i.e., LTD. Thus, the molecular logic is: LFS $\\Rightarrow$ modest, prolonged $Ca^{2+}$ $\\Rightarrow$ phosphatase activation (calcineurin, PP1) $\\Rightarrow$ dephosphorylation and internalization of AMPA receptors $\\Rightarrow$ LTD.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\nA describes a large, rapid $Ca^{2+}$ influx activating CaMKII and promoting AMPA receptor insertion, which is the canonical mechanism for LTP, not LTD. Therefore, A is incorrect.\nB states that LFS produces a modest, prolonged $Ca^{2+}$ increase that activates protein phosphatases (e.g., calcineurin), leading to dephosphorylation and removal of AMPA receptors from the synapse. This matches the established mechanism for NMDA receptor-dependent LTD in CA1. Therefore, B is correct.\nC claims modest, prolonged $Ca^{2+}$ preferentially activates kinases such as PKA and CaMKII to decrease synaptic strength; this contradicts the calcium-threshold rule and the typical roles of these kinases in LTP, so C is incorrect.\nD attributes LTD to presynaptic vesicle depletion; while short-term depression can arise from vesicle depletion, CA1 LTD is classically expressed postsynaptically and depends on postsynaptic $Ca^{2+}$-dependent phosphatases, so D is incorrect as an explanation of LTD.\nE suggests LFS selectively activates metabotropic glutamate receptors and is completely independent of calcium; classical CA1 NMDA receptor-dependent LTD is explicitly calcium dependent. Although mGluR-dependent LTD exists, it is not completely independent of calcium and is not the general explanation for LFS-induced LTD in CA1. Hence, E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is given by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2341416"}]}
