This practice shifts our focus from single parameters to the distribution of synaptic inputs, which can be measured as miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). You will learn to identify the key signature of multiplicative scaling by analyzing how it systematically transforms the cumulative probability distribution of mEPSC amplitudes, a crucial skill for interpreting real experimental data [@problem_id:2338659].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating homeostatic plasticity in a cultured cortical neuron. The neuron is first studied under control conditions. Then, its overall activity is chronically silenced for 48 hours by applying Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a drug that blocks voltage-gated sodium channels and thus prevents action potentials. This prolonged silencing is known to trigger a compensatory homeostatic response.\n\nTo probe the nature of this response, the scientist records Miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents (mEPSCs), which represent the response to the spontaneous release of a single quantum of neurotransmitter and whose amplitudes are proportional to the strength of individual synapses. The amplitudes of hundreds of mEPSCs are measured both before (Control) and after (TTX-treated) the activity blockade.\n\nThe scientist hypothesizes that the neuron underwent multiplicative synaptic scaling, a process where the strengths of all excitatory synapses are multiplied by the same factor to boost the neuron's sensitivity to input. To test this, they plot the cumulative probability distribution of the mEPSC amplitudes for both conditions on the same graph, with amplitude on the x-axis and cumulative probability on the y-axis.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions of the data provides the most direct and specific evidence for multiplicative synaptic scaling, as opposed to other forms of plasticity (e.g., an additive increase in synaptic strength)?\n\nA. The cumulative probability curve for the TTX-treated neuron is identical in shape to the control curve but is shifted to the right by a constant value along the amplitude axis.\n\nB. When the amplitude axis (x-axis) of the control data is multiplied by a single constant factor greater than 1, the resulting curve perfectly overlays the cumulative probability curve of the TTX-treated data.\n\nC. The cumulative probability curve for the TTX-treated neuron shows a significant rightward shift only for the highest amplitude values (the top 20% of events), while the rest of the curve is largely unchanged.\n\nD. The entire cumulative probability curve for the TTX-treated neuron is shifted upwards, such that for any given amplitude, the cumulative probability is higher than in the control condition.\n\nE. The cumulative probability curve for the TTX-treated neuron becomes significantly steeper and is centered at a higher mean amplitude, indicating that the synapses have become more uniform in strength.", "solution": "Let the random variable of mEPSC amplitudes under control be $A_{\\mathrm{C}}$ with cumulative distribution function $F_{\\mathrm{C}}(a)=P(A_{\\mathrm{C}}\\leq a)$. Let the TTX-treated amplitudes be $A_{\\mathrm{T}}$ with cumulative distribution $F_{\\mathrm{T}}(a)=P(A_{\\mathrm{T}}\\leq a)$.\n\nUnder multiplicative synaptic scaling by a single factor $s>1$, all synaptic amplitudes are multiplied by the same constant:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{T}}=s\\,A_{\\mathrm{C}}.\n$$\nTherefore, for any amplitude value $a$,\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{T}}(a)=P(A_{\\mathrm{T}}\\leq a)=P(sA_{\\mathrm{C}}\\leq a)=P\\!\\left(A_{\\mathrm{C}}\\leq \\frac{a}{s}\\right)=F_{\\mathrm{C}}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{s}\\right).\n$$\nThis implies that the TTX cumulative distribution is obtained from the control cumulative distribution by a horizontal rescaling of the amplitude axis by the factor $s$. Equivalently, if one multiplies the amplitude axis of the control data by the single constant factor $s$, the rescaled control cumulative distribution $a\\mapsto F_{\\mathrm{C}}(a/s)$ exactly overlays $F_{\\mathrm{T}}(a)$.
