By considering a hypothetical scenario where calcium is removed, you will explore the absolute dependence of neurotransmitter release on this key ion, providing a solid foundation for understanding how its residual accumulation leads to potentiation.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the mechanisms of short-term synaptic plasticity at a glutamatergic synapse in a central nervous system preparation. This particular synapse is known to reliably exhibit Post-Tetanic Potentiation (PTP), a phenomenon where a brief, high-frequency train of stimuli (a tetanus) results in an enhanced postsynaptic response that lasts for several minutes. The leading hypothesis for PTP is that it arises from the accumulation of residual calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in the presynaptic terminal following the tetanus.\n\nThe experiment proceeds as follows:\n1.  In a standard physiological extracellular solution containing $Ca^{2+}$, a single presynaptic stimulus is applied, and a baseline Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) is recorded in the postsynaptic neuron.\n2.  The standard solution is then washed out and replaced with a modified extracellular solution that is identical in all aspects except that it contains zero $Ca^{2+}$ and includes a potent, fast-acting calcium chelator (a substance that binds free calcium ions).\n3.  While in this calcium-free solution, a tetanic stimulation protocol is delivered to the presynaptic axon.\n4.  Immediately after the tetanus, the presynaptic terminal is directly depolarized by a brief current injection from a microelectrode. This direct depolarization is calibrated to be of the same magnitude as that caused by a normal action potential.\n\nWhat is the expected postsynaptic response during step 4, as compared to the baseline EPSP recorded in step 1?\n\nA. A potentiated EPSP will be recorded, as direct depolarization bypasses the need for the initial action potential and more efficiently triggers the machinery enhanced by the tetanus.\n\nB. A potentiated EPSP will be recorded, because PTP is an intrinsic modification of the vesicle release machinery that, once induced by the tetanus, no longer depends on calcium for its expression.\n\nC. No EPSP will be recorded, because neurotransmitter release is fundamentally dependent on calcium influx from the extracellular space.\n\nD. A reduced EPSP will be recorded, because the absence of extracellular calcium slightly hyperpolarizes the presynaptic terminal, making release less efficient.\n\nE. No EPSP will be recorded, because the tetanus in a calcium-free solution depletes the ready-releasable pool of vesicles.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the outcome of an experiment designed to test the calcium-dependence of Post-Tetanic Potentiation (PTP). To solve this, we must break down the process of synaptic transmission and the mechanism of PTP.\n\n**Step 1: The Fundamental Mechanism of Neurotransmitter Release**\nStandard chemical synaptic transmission follows a precise sequence of events.\n1.  An action potential propagates down the axon and depolarizes the presynaptic terminal.\n2.  This depolarization opens voltage-gated calcium channels ($Ca_v$).\n3.  Because the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ is much higher in the extracellular fluid than inside the cell, $Ca^{2+}$ ions flow down their electrochemical gradient into the presynaptic terminal.\n4.  The influx of $Ca^{2+}$ acts as a critical second messenger. It binds to a protein sensor, typically synaptotagmin, which is associated with synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters.\n5.  This binding event triggers a conformational change in the SNARE protein complex, causing the vesicle membrane to fuse with the presynaptic plasma membrane.\n6.  This fusion event, called exocytosis, releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.\n7.  Neurotransmitters diffuse across the cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, causing a postsynaptic potential (in this case, an EPSP).\n\nThe crucial point here is that the influx of extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ is the direct and indispensable trigger for vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.\n\n**Step 2: The Mechanism of Post-Tetanic Potentiation (PTP)**\nPTP is a short-term enhancement of synaptic strength. It is caused by a high-frequency train of action potentials (a tetanus).\n1.  During the tetanus, action potentials arrive in rapid succession, repeatedly opening voltage-gated calcium channels.\n2.  This leads to a large and sustained influx of $Ca^{2+}$ into the presynaptic terminal.\n3.  The cellular mechanisms responsible for removing $Ca^{2+}$ from the cytoplasm (pumps and buffers) are temporarily overwhelmed.\n4.  Consequently, after the tetanus ends, the baseline intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration remains elevated for several minutes. This elevated baseline level is referred to as \"residual calcium\".\n5.  When a subsequent, single action potential arrives at the terminal, the new influx of $Ca^{2+}$ adds to this already-elevated residual calcium. The total peak $Ca^{2+}$ concentration reached is therefore significantly higher than it would be without the preceding tetanus.\n6.  Since the rate of vesicle release is highly sensitive to the intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration, this higher peak concentration triggers the fusion of more synaptic vesicles, releasing more neurotransmitter and causing a larger, or \"potentiated,\" EPSP.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Experimental Conditions**\nThe experiment systematically removes the key ingredient for both standard release and PTP.\n-   The standard solution is replaced with a **calcium-free solution** containing a chelator. This ensures that there is virtually no free $Ca^{2+}$ in the extracellular space available to enter the cell.\n-   A tetanus is delivered (step 3). The presynaptic axon is stimulated, and action potentials depolarize the terminal, opening the voltage-gated calcium channels. However, since there is no extracellular $Ca^{2+}$, **no calcium influx occurs**. This means no neurotransmitter is released during the tetanus, and more importantly, **no residual calcium can accumulate**. The very basis for PTP induction is absent.\n-   The presynaptic terminal is then directly depolarized (step 4). This action successfully mimics the voltage change of an action potential and opens the voltage-gated calcium channels. However, just as during the tetanus, the extracellular fluid is devoid of $Ca^{2+}$. Therefore, despite the channels being open, **there is still no influx of calcium ions**.\n\n**Step 4: Predicting the Outcome**\nWithout the influx of $Ca^{2+}$ in step 4, the synaptotagmin sensor is not activated, and the cascade leading to vesicle exocytosis cannot be initiated. No neurotransmitter will be released into the synaptic cleft. If no neurotransmitter is released, it cannot bind to postsynaptic receptors, and therefore, **no EPSP will be generated**.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluating the Options**\n-   A is incorrect. Direct depolarization does not bypass the need for calcium; it only opens the channels that allow calcium to enter. The potentiation machinery was never engaged in the first place due to the lack of calcium during the tetanus.\n-   B is incorrect. This misrepresents the mechanism of PTP. PTP is not a permanent, calcium-independent change to the machinery; its expression relies on the dynamic interplay between residual calcium and new calcium influx.\n-   **C is correct.** It accurately identifies the fundamental requirement of extracellular calcium influx for any form of neurotransmitter release at this type of synapse. Since there is no influx, there is no release, and thus no EPSP.\n-   D is incorrect. While ion concentrations can affect membrane potential, the primary and absolute failure point here is the lack of the calcium signal itself, not a minor modulation of release efficiency. The result is a complete block of release, not a reduction.\n-   E is incorrect. The ready-releasable pool of vesicles is depleted by *calcium-dependent exocytosis*. Since there was no calcium influx during the tetanus, there was no vesicle release, and therefore the pool was not depleted. The failure is not a lack of vesicles, but a lack of the trigger to release them.\n\nTherefore, the only possible outcome is the complete absence of a postsynaptic response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2350549"}, {"introduction": "In a living synapse, multiple forms of short-term plasticity can occur simultaneously, each with its own characteristic lifespan.

The experiment involves monitoring the amplitude of Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents (EPSCs) in a postsynaptic neuron in response to stimulation of a presynaptic axon.\n\nInitially, a baseline is established by stimulating the presynaptic axon once every 30 seconds, which consistently elicits an EPSC with a stable average amplitude of 120 picoamperes (pA).\n\nFollowing this, a high-frequency stimulation protocol, known as a tetanus, is applied to the presynaptic axon.

Empirically and from basic synaptic physiology, the post-tetanic EPSC amplitude can be modeled as a sum of multiplicative components superimposed on a baseline.

The fundamental property distinguishing these processes is their time constants, ordered as\n$$\n\\tau_{F} \\ll \\tau_{A} \\ll \\tau_{P},\n$$\nwith facilitation decaying over fractions of a second to a few seconds, augmentation over several to tens of seconds, and PTP over tens of seconds to minutes.\n\nTo isolate PTP while minimizing contamination from augmentation, we seek a time window $t$ such that\n$$\nt \\gg \\tau_{A} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t \\lesssim \\tau_{P},\n$$\nso that the augmentation term $a_{A}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{A})$ is small compared to the PTP term $a_{P}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{P})$, i.e.,\n$$\n\\frac{a_{A}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{A})}{a_{P}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{P})} \\ll 1.\n$$\n\nNow apply these principles to the provided data. The EPSC amplitude is strongly elevated shortly after the tetanus ($t=4$ s: $310$ pA) and declines rapidly by $t=15$ s ($220$ pA), indicating large contributions from fast components (facilitation and especially augmentation). By $t=60$ s, the amplitude is $175$ pA, showing that the rapid decay has largely subsided and the remaining enhancement is smaller and decays more slowly, consistent with PTP dominance. By $t=180$ s, the amplitude is $135$ pA, approaching the baseline $E_{0}=120$ pA, and by $t=420$ s, it returns to baseline, indicating that PTP has largely dissipated by several minutes.\n\nEvaluate each proposed window against the criterion $t \\gg \\tau_{A}$ but $t \\lesssim \\tau_{P}$:\n- Option A ($t=2$ s to $t=8$ s) lies in the interval where augmentation is prominent; contamination by augmentation is high, so it is not appropriate for isolating PTP.\n- Option B ($t=12$ s to $t=20$ s) still lies within a timescale where augmentation is substantial (the data at $t=15$ s are still far above baseline with a recent rapid decline), so contamination by augmentation remains significant.\n- Option C ($t=45$ s to $t=90$ s) occurs after augmentation has mostly decayed (given the rapid drop by $t=15$ s and the slower change by $t=60$ s) but while PTP remains appreciable. This window satisfies $t \\gg \\tau_{A}$ and $t \\lesssim \\tau_{P}$ and thus preferentially reflects PTP with minimal augmentation contamination.\n- Option D ($t=240$ s to $t=360$ s) occurs when the EPSC amplitude is near baseline, indicating that PTP is greatly diminished. Although augmentation is negligible here, the small residual PTP would be difficult to quantify and would underestimate the PTP magnitude; this window is suboptimal for specifically quantifying PTP.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate window for specifically quantifying PTP, with minimal contamination from augmentation, is $t=45$ s to $t=90$ s.\n\nNote on protocol description: although the text states that stimulation reverted to one stimulus every $30$ s, amplitudes at $t=4$ s and $t=15$ s were reported. This can be interpreted as additional sampling pulses delivered to characterize early dynamics.
