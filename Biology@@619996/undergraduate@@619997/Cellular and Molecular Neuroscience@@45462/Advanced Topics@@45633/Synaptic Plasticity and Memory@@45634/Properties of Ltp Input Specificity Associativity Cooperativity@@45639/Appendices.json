This exercise [@problem_id:2348873] provides a foundational look at how neurons integrate information, demonstrating that even inputs that are individually insufficient can collectively drive synaptic strengthening.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating synaptic plasticity in an in-vitro hippocampal slice preparation. Two distinct, non-overlapping sets of presynaptic afferents, labeled S1 and S2, are identified that both synapse onto the same postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal neuron. The experiment is conducted in three phases:\n\n**Phase 1 (Baseline Measurement):** A single low-frequency test pulse is delivered to pathway S1, and the resulting Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) in the CA1 neuron is measured. After a delay, the same procedure is repeated for pathway S2. Both stimuli are confirmed to be 'weak', meaning they produce a small, sub-threshold EPSP.\n\n**Phase 2 (Induction Protocol):** A high-frequency tetanus (a rapid burst of stimuli) is applied *simultaneously* to both pathways S1 and S2. It is known from prior control experiments that applying this same tetanus to either S1 or S2 *individually* does not cause any lasting change in their respective EPSP amplitudes.\n\n**Phase 3 (Post-Induction Test):** Thirty minutes after the induction protocol, the single low-frequency test pulses are again delivered independently, first to S1 and then to S2, and their respective EPSP amplitudes are measured.\n\nBased on the known properties of cooperativity and associativity in Hebbian Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed when comparing the EPSP amplitudes in Phase 3 to the baseline measurements from Phase 1?\n\nA. The EPSP amplitude for both S1 and S2 will be significantly and lastingly larger than their baseline amplitudes.\n\nB.

There will be no significant change in the EPSP amplitudes for either S1 or S2 compared to their baseline.\n\nD. The EPSP amplitude for S1 will be significantly larger, but the amplitude for S2 will remain unchanged from its baseline.\n\nE. Both S1 and S2 will show a transient increase in EPSP amplitude that decays back to baseline levels within a few minutes.", "solution": "We identify the relevant Hebbian LTP principles: input specificity, cooperativity, associativity, and the voltage dependence of NMDA receptors due to the $Mg^{2+}$ block. LTP at a given synapse requires coincident presynaptic glutamate release and sufficient postsynaptic depolarization to relieve the $Mg^{2+}$ block of NMDA receptors, permitting $Ca^{2+}$ influx that triggers the biochemical cascades underlying LTP.\n\nPhase 1 establishes that single weak test pulses to S1 and S2 each produce small, subthreshold EPSPs that do not by themselves induce LTP. Phase 2 applies a high-frequency tetanus to S1 and S2 simultaneously. Prior controls show that this tetanus to either S1 or S2 alone is insufficient to induce LTP, implying that the postsynaptic depolarization produced by either input alone during tetanus is below the threshold needed to relieve the $Mg^{2+}$ block of NMDA receptors and produce the requisite $Ca^{2+}$ influx.\n\nBy cooperativity, multiple weak inputs that are coactive can summate to produce a larger postsynaptic depolarization. When S1 and S2 are tetanized simultaneously, the spatial and temporal summation of their EPSPs increases postsynaptic depolarization sufficiently to relieve the $Mg^{2+}$ block. Because both S1 and S2 are active during this depolarization, input specificity ensures that only synapses from S1 and S2 are eligible for modification, and associativity ensures that weak inputs active during strong postsynaptic depolarization can undergo LTP. In this case, both weak inputs are coactive and together generate the needed depolarization; therefore both sets of synapses meet the coincidence condition and both undergo LTP.\n\nPhase 3 occurs thirty minutes after induction. Hebbian LTP is characterized by a lasting increase in synaptic efficacy on this timescale, whereas transient plasticity (e.g., post-tetanic potentiation or short-term potentiation) would decay within minutes. Therefore, both S1 and S2 should exhibit significantly and lastingly larger EPSP amplitudes compared to baseline.\n\nEliminating alternatives:\n- B implies LTD, which contradicts the high-frequency tetanic induction and Hebbian LTP properties described.\n- C contradicts cooperativity during simultaneous tetanus.\n- D would require only S1 to have met the coincidence conditions; however, both S1 and S2 were coactive and contributed to the depolarization, so both should potentiate.\n- E predicts a transient change, inconsistent with the thirty-minute post-induction persistence expected for LTP.\n\nHence, the most likely outcome is that both S1 and S2 show significant, lasting increases in EPSP amplitude relative to baseline.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2348873"}, {"introduction": "Building on the idea of cooperative inputs, we now examine **associativity**.

Let $x_{i}(t)$ denote presynaptic activity at synapse $i$, and let $V_{m}(t)$ be the postsynaptic membrane potential. A necessary condition for LTP at synapse $i$ is coincident presynaptic glutamate release and sufficient postsynaptic depolarization to relieve $Mg^{2+}$ block of NMDA receptors, allowing a $Ca^{2+}$ influx that exceeds a threshold. A compact statement is\n$$\n\\Delta w_{i}>0 \\iff \\int x_{i}(t)\\, H\\big(V_{m}(t)-\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}\\big)\\, dt > C_{\\mathrm{LTP}},\n$$\nwhere $H$ is the Heaviside step function, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$ is the depolarization threshold for NMDA unblock, and $C_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$ is the calcium-dependent induction threshold. This encodes input specificity (only synapses with $x_{i}(t)$ active can potentiate) and associativity (a weak $x_{i}(t)$ can potentiate if $V_{m}(t)$ is elevated by concurrent strong input elsewhere).\n\nGiven the stated properties:\n- Pathway A: strong HFS alone gives $V_{m}(t)>\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$ during its activation, so $A$ satisfies the condition and undergoes LTP.\n- Pathways B and C: the same HFS is weak; presynaptic activation occurs but $V_{m}(t)$ does not cross $\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$ when given alone, so $\\int x_{i}(t)\\, H(V_{m}(t)-\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}})\\, dt=0$ and no LTP.\n\nWe analyze each option against the condition.\n\nA. Strong HFS to A, then one hour later weak HFS to B. The weak B stimulation is not coincident with A’s depolarization; at the time of B’s activation $V_{m}(t)$ is not elevated by A, so $H(V_{m}-\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}})=0$ during $x_{B}(t)$ and B fails to reach LTP by associativity. One could invoke synaptic tagging and capture: let $P(t)$ be plasticity-related proteins induced by the strong A and $T_{i}(t)$ the tag set by weak stimulation. Late LTP at B requires $\\int T_{B}(t)P(t)\\, dt$ to exceed a threshold. With a delay of about one hour, the overlap depends on decay constants of $P(t)$ and $T_{B}(t)$; without guaranteed overlap, this protocol is not the reliable, canonical way to ensure LTP at B while sparing C. It does not exploit certain associativity.\n\nB. Weak HFS simultaneously to B and C. By cooperativity, simultaneous activation of two weak inputs can summate to raise $V_{m}(t)$ above $\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$ during both inputs’ activity. Then both integrals $\\int x_{B}(t)\\, H(\\cdot)\\, dt$ and $\\int x_{C}(t)\\, H(\\cdot)\\, dt$ become positive, potentiating both B and C, which violates the requirement to leave C unpotentiated.\n\nC. Strong HFS to A and simultaneously weak HFS to B. During the coincident activation, A’s strong input elevates $V_{m}(t)$ above $\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$, while B provides presynaptic glutamate release at its synapse. Thus $x_{B}(t)$ overlaps with $H(V_{m}(t)-\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}})=1$, making $\\int x_{B}(t)\\, H(\\cdot)\\, dt$ exceed $C_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$ and inducing LTP at B by associativity. Pathway C is inactive ($x_{C}(t)=0$), so input specificity prevents any change at C. This achieves LTP at B while leaving C unpotentiated.\n\nD. Strong HFS to A only. Only A is active and depolarizing; B and C are inactive, so their $x_{i}(t)=0$ and no LTP occurs at B or C. This fails to potentiate B.\n\nE. Weak HFS to B only for longer duration. Increasing duration without increasing the peak depolarization still fails to relieve NMDA block if $V_{m}(t)$ never exceeds $\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$. The integral remains zero because $H(V_{m}-\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}})=0$ at all times, so B does not reliably potentiate.\n\nTherefore, the protocol that specifically potentiates B while leaving C unpotentiated is to pair B’s weak HFS with A’s strong HFS simultaneously, exploiting associativity and input specificity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2348888"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the \"what\" of LTP properties, this final exercise challenges you to understand the \"why\" by focusing on the underlying molecular machinery.

The experimental setup involves recording from a single postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal neuron that receives two independent, non-overlapping excitatory synaptic inputs, designated Pathway 1 and Pathway 2.\n\nIn the control condition with normal, wild-type mice, the following observations are made:\n1.  A strong, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) protocol applied to Pathway 1 is sufficient to induce Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a persistent strengthening of its synapses.\n2.  A weak, low-frequency stimulation (LFS) protocol applied to Pathway 2 is, by itself, insufficient to induce LTP at its synapses.\n3.  When the weak LFS is applied to Pathway 2 concurrently with the strong HFS applied to Pathway 1, LTP is induced at the synapses of *both* pathways. This phenomenon is known as associativity.\n\nThe core of this associative process relies on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a glutamate-gated ion channel. Normally, this channel is blocked by a magnesium ion ($Mg^{2+}$) at resting membrane potentials. The channel only opens to allow calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) influx when it both binds glutamate and experiences significant postsynaptic membrane depolarization, which expels the $Mg^{2+}$ ion.\n\nNow, the neuroscientist repeats the experiment using a genetically engineered mouse line. In these mice, the NMDA receptors have been modified such that they are no longer blocked by $Mg^{2+}$ at any membrane potential. The receptors still require glutamate to open.\n\nThe researcher applies only the weak LFS protocol to Pathway 2 in a slice from the genetically engineered mouse. Which of the following outcomes is the most likely result for the synapses of Pathway 2?\n\nA. The weak stimulation will still be insufficient to induce LTP, and associativity will be preserved as in the wild-type mouse.\n\nB. LTP will be successfully induced, indicating that the property of associativity has been lost.\n\nC. The synapses will undergo Long-Term Depression (LTD), a weakening of the synapse, instead of LTP.\n\nD. LTP will be induced not only in the stimulated Pathway 2 but also in the unstimulated Pathway 1, indicating a loss of both associativity and input specificity.\n\nE. The postsynaptic neuron will die from excitotoxicity before any change in synaptic strength can be measured.", "solution": "We identify the relevant mechanism of LTP induction as NMDA receptor–dependent calcium entry that requires two coincident conditions in wild-type synapses: glutamate binding (presynaptic activity at a given synapse) and relief of the voltage-dependent $Mg^{2+}$ block (sufficient postsynaptic depolarization). Formally, we can express the NMDA receptor open probability at a synapse as\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{open}}([\\text{glu}],V)=B([\\text{glu}])\\,G(V),\n$$\nwhere $B([\\text{glu}])$ reflects glutamate binding and $G(V)$ represents the voltage-dependent relief of the $Mg^{2+}$ block. In wild type, at resting potentials, $G(V)\\approx 0$; with strong depolarization, $G(V)$ increases, allowing channel opening and $Ca^{2+}$ influx.\n\nLTP versus LTD outcomes can be described by calcium-dependent induction rules. Let $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ denote the postsynaptic calcium signal driven by NMDA receptor current. A standard plasticity rule is:\n- If $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}} > \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$, then LTP is induced.\n- If $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}}  [Ca^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}  \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$, then LTD is induced.\n- If $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}  \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}}$, then no lasting change occurs.\nThese thresholds $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$ are properties of the postsynaptic signaling cascade.\n\nIn the control condition:\n1. Strong HFS at Pathway 1 produces large postsynaptic depolarization, increasing $G(V)$ and thus $P_{\\mathrm{open}}$ at Pathway 1 synapses where $B([\\text{glu}])0$. The resulting $Ca^{2+}$ influx elevates $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ above $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$, yielding LTP at Pathway 1.\n2. Weak LFS at Pathway 2 alone provides glutamate release ($B([\\text{glu}])0$) but insufficient depolarization, so $G(V)\\approx 0$ and $P_{\\mathrm{open}}\\approx 0$, resulting in negligible $Ca^{2+}$ influx and thus $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}}$, producing no LTP.\n3. Concurrent weak LFS at Pathway 2 with strong HFS at Pathway 1 generates sufficient postsynaptic depolarization globally to relieve the $Mg^{2+}$ block at Pathway 2 during its glutamate release, so $G(V)$ is high while $B([\\text{glu}])0$, raising $P_{\\mathrm{open}}$ and $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ above $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$ at Pathway 2. This is associativity: co-activation allows LTP at the weakly stimulated pathway.\n\nIn the genetically engineered mouse, the NMDA receptors are no longer blocked by $Mg^{2+}$ at any membrane potential. This manipulation sets\n$$\nG(V)=1 \\quad \\text{for all } V,\n$$\nwhile preserving the requirement for glutamate binding, so $B([\\text{glu}])$ remains necessary. Therefore, during weak LFS at Pathway 2 alone, presynaptic release produces glutamate transients at Pathway 2 synapses, giving $B([\\text{glu}])0$. With $G(V)=1$ regardless of depolarization, the open probability becomes\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{open}}=B([\\text{glu}]),\n$$\nand NMDA channels open during each glutamate pulse, allowing $Ca^{2+}$ influx even without strong postsynaptic depolarization. Relative to wild type, the $Ca^{2+}$ current per glutamate event is increased because the voltage-dependent block no longer suppresses conductance. Consequently, the integrated calcium signal $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ during the weak LFS is elevated and is likely to exceed $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$, thus satisfying the LTP induction criterion.\n\nInput specificity remains preserved because NMDA receptor opening still requires glutamate; at the unstimulated Pathway 1, $B([\\text{glu}])=0$, implying\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{open}}=0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad I_{Ca}=0,\n$$\nso no $Ca^{2+}$-dependent plasticity is induced there. Therefore, LTP will occur at the weakly stimulated Pathway 2 alone, and the associativity property (the necessity for coincident depolarization from a separate strong input) is lost. LTD is unlikely under these conditions because removing the $Mg^{2+}$ block increases $Ca^{2+}$ entry relative to wild type LFS, pushing the calcium signal toward or above the LTP threshold rather than into the LTD range. Global excitotoxicity is also unlikely in this protocol because only synapses experiencing glutamate release open NMDA receptors, limiting $Ca^{2+}$ entry spatially.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is successful LTP at Pathway 2 with loss of associativity while preserving input specificity, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2348863"}]}
