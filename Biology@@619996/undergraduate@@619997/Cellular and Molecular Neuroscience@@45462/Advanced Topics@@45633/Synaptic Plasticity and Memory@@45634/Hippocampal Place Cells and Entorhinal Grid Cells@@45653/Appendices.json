This thought experiment challenges you to predict the outcome of a clever experimental design meant to distinguish between control by external sensory landmarks and an internal sense of distance traveled, known as path integration. Analyzing this scenario [@problem_id:2338336] is a classic exercise in systems neuroscience, teaching you how to dissect competing hypotheses about neural computation.", "problem": "A team of neuroscientists is studying spatial navigation in a rat. The rat is trained to run along a one-dimensional linear track of length $L$ in complete darkness. The track starts at position $x=0$ and ends at $x=L$. A small, non-diffusive olfactory cue (a drop of cedarwood oil) is placed at the midpoint of the track, $x=L/2$. The researchers observe that the place cell consistently fires with maximum activity when the rat is at the position $x=L/2$.\n\nTo determine whether the cell's firing is controlled by the external olfactory cue or by the rat's internal sense of self-motion and distance traveled (a process known as path integration), they conduct a critical experiment. After the initial training, the rat is picked up from the starting point ($x=0$) and passively transported in an opaque, enclosed cart (preventing any visual or self-motion cues) to the position $x=L/4$. From this new starting point, the rat is released and runs along the track towards $x=L$.\n\nAssume the place cell is exclusively controlled by only one of the two possible mechanisms (either the olfactory cue or path integration). Which of the following statements accurately describes the predicted outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. If controlled by path integration, the cell will fire at $x=L/2$. If controlled by the olfactory cue, it will fire at $x=3L/4$.\n\nB. If controlled by path integration, the cell will fire at $x=3L/4$. If controlled by the olfactory cue, it will fire at $x=L/2$.\n\nC. If controlled by path integration, the cell will fire at $x=L/4$. If controlled by the olfactory cue, it will fire at $x=L/2$.\n\nD. The place cell will not fire in this trial because the initial conditions have changed, resetting the cognitive map.\n\nE. The place cell will fire at both $x=L/2$ and $x=3L/4$ as the brain attempts to reconcile the conflicting information.", "solution": "During training, the rat starts at $x=0$ and the cell fires maximally at $x=L/2$. This observation is consistent with two distinct control mechanisms:\n- Cue control: the firing is anchored to the fixed external olfactory cue at position $x_{c}=L/2$.\n- Path integration: the firing is anchored to a fixed traveled distance from the start. Since the start is at $x=0$ and the firing occurs at $x=L/2$, the criterion is a path-integrated distance $d^{*}=L/2$.\n\nIn the critical test, the rat is passively transported (no self-motion cues) to $x_{0}=L/4$ and then released to run. Passive transport prevents updating of internal odometry during transport, so the path integrator’s origin for subsequent running is effectively reset at the release point $x_{0}$.\n\nPredictions:\n- If controlled by the olfactory cue, the firing location is the fixed cue position, so the cell fires when $x=x_{c}=L/2$, independent of starting position.\n- If controlled by path integration, the cell fires when the rat has run the same internal distance $d^{*}=L/2$ from the new start. Starting at $x_{0}=L/4$, the physical position at firing is\n$$\nx=x_{0}+d^{*}=\\frac{L}{4}+\\frac{L}{2}=\\frac{3L}{4}.\n$$\n\nComparing with the options, this corresponds to: path integration predicts firing at $x=3L/4$, and cue control predicts firing at $x=L/2$. This is exactly statement B. The other options either swap these predictions or propose outcomes inconsistent with exclusive control by a single mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2338336"}, {"introduction": "Having explored what anchors a place field, we now ask how a collection of place fields—a cognitive map—adapts when the environment itself changes. This problem models the well-documented phenomenon of 'rescaling,' where the brain's spatial map flexibly stretches or compresses to match new environmental boundaries. By working through this calculation [@problem_id:2338331], you will develop a quantitative understanding of the dynamic nature of hippocampal representations.", "problem": "An experimental neuroscientist is studying spatial navigation in a mouse model. The mouse is trained to run back and forth on a linear track of length $L$. By implanting microelectrodes, the scientist simultaneously records the activity of two distinct principal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. These neurons are identified as place cells.\n\nIn the initial experiment on the track of length $L$, the first place cell (Cell 1) exhibits a single, stable place field with its peak firing rate centered at a position $x_1 = \\frac{1}{4}L$ from the start of the track. The second place cell (Cell 2) has its place field centered at $x_2 = \\frac{3}{4}L$.\n\nThe scientist then abruptly modifies the experimental setup. While keeping the starting point fixed, the visual cues marking the end of the track are moved, effectively doubling the track's length to $2L$. The mouse is then allowed to explore this new, longer track. The scientist observes that the existing place fields do not disappear or randomly relocate (a phenomenon known as global remapping). Instead, the spatial map \"stretches\" to accommodate the new environment. This stretching is proportional, meaning the new location of a place field is scaled by the same factor as the environmental scaling, relative to the fixed starting point.\n\nAssuming this proportional rescaling model holds true for both cells, what is the new distance between the centers of the place fields for Cell 1 and Cell 2 on the elongated track? Express your answer as an analytic expression in terms of $L$.", "solution": "The original place field centers are at positions $x_{1}=\\frac{1}{4}L$ and $x_{2}=\\frac{3}{4}L$ along a track of length $L$.\n\nWhen the track length is scaled from $L$ to $2L$ with the start point fixed, the spatial coordinates rescale proportionally about the start by a factor\n$$\ns=\\frac{2L}{L}=2\n$$\nUnder proportional rescaling relative to the fixed start, positions transform as\n$$\nx' = s\\,x\n$$\nTherefore, the new centers are\n$x_{1}'=s\\,x_{1}=2\\cdot \\frac{1}{4}L=\\frac{1}{2}L,\\qquad x_{2}'=s\\,x_{2}=2\\cdot \\frac{3}{4}L=\\frac{3}{2}L$.\nThe new distance between the centers is\n$d'=\\left|x_{2}'-x_{1}'\\right|=\\left|\\frac{3}{2}L-\\frac{1}{2}L\\right|=L$.\nEquivalently, using the linearity of the scaling,\n$d' = s\\,|x_{2}-x_{1}| = 2\\cdot \\left|\\frac{3}{4}L-\\frac{1}{4}L\\right| = 2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}L = L$.\nThus, the new distance between the place field centers is $L$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{L}$$", "id": "2338331"}, {"introduction": "Place cells do not work alone; they are a crucial component of a larger navigational circuit. This final practice delves into the circuit-level origins of place fields by considering their relationship with grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex. You will predict the consequences of silencing this critical input [@problem_id:2338368], revealing the hierarchical organization of the brain's GPS system and the specific contributions of grid cells to the formation of place fields.", "problem": "In the mammalian brain, the hippocampus contains neurons known as \"place cells,\" which exhibit a high firing rate only when an animal is in a specific location within an environment, referred to as the cell's \"place field.\" This activity is believed to form the basis of a cognitive map. A primary source of input to the hippocampus is the Medial Entorhinal Cortex (MEC), which contains \"grid cells.\" Grid cells are notable for firing at multiple locations that form a periodic, hexagonal lattice across the entire environment, providing a metric sense of space.\n\nConsider an experiment where a laboratory rat has been familiarized with a large, open, circular enclosure. Stable and well-defined place fields have been recorded from several individual place cells in its hippocampus. Following this characterization, a neuroscientist performs a targeted and rapid pharmacological inactivation of the rat's MEC, effectively silencing the output of its grid cells without affecting other brain regions.\n\nAssuming the rat continues to explore the enclosure, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the immediate effect on the firing properties of the previously characterized hippocampal place cells?\n\nA. The place cells completely cease all firing activity, as their primary excitatory drive has been removed.\n\nB. The place fields remain perfectly stable and unchanged, as they are stored in the hippocampal circuitry as a form of long-term memory.\n\nC. The place cells begin to fire in a hexagonal grid-like pattern, directly adopting the role of the silenced grid cells.\n\nD. The place cells continue to fire, but their place fields become significantly larger, less spatially selective, and less stable over time.\n\nE. The place cells lose their spatial tuning entirely and begin to fire at a constant, low rate regardless of the rat's location in the enclosure.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify circuit dependencies and remaining inputs. Hippocampal place cells receive substantial spatial input from the Medial Entorhinal Cortex (MEC), including grid cells, but they also receive inputs from other sources such as CA3 recurrent collaterals, dentate gyrus, lateral entorhinal cortex, and subcortical modulatory systems. Therefore, silencing MEC removes a major spatial metric input but does not eliminate all hippocampal excitatory drive.\n\nStep 2: Predict immediate functional consequences of MEC inactivation based on known roles. Grid cells provide periodic, metric spatial information that contributes to the precision and stability of hippocampal place fields. Removing this input is expected to reduce spatial precision and stability, but not abolish firing altogether because other inputs and intrinsic hippocampal circuitry can still support activity and partial spatial tuning.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate options against known outcomes from acute MEC inactivation. \n- Option A predicts complete cessation of firing, which is inconsistent because other excitatory and modulatory inputs remain; experimentally, place cells continue to fire after MEC inactivation.\n- Option B predicts no change, which contradicts the established role of MEC in providing metric stability; experimentally, spatial information decreases and fields do not remain perfectly stable.\n- Option C predicts emergence of grid-like firing in hippocampus despite MEC being silenced, which is mechanistically implausible and contrary to observations; hippocampal neurons do not generate hexagonal periodicity de novo when grid input is absent.\n- Option D predicts continued firing with degraded spatial properties—larger fields, reduced selectivity, and reduced stability—matching experimental findings from rapid MEC inactivation showing increased field size, reduced spatial information, and drift over time.\n- Option E predicts complete loss of spatial tuning and uniform low-rate firing, which is too strong; residual spatial tuning typically persists.\n\nStep 4: Select the option that best matches the immediate effect. The experimentally supported and mechanistically consistent outcome is that place cells continue firing but exhibit enlarged, less selective, and less stable place fields, which corresponds to Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2338368"}]}
