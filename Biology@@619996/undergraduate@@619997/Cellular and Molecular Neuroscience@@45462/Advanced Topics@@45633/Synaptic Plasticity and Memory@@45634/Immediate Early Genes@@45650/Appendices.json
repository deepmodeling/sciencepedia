[@problem_id:2338813]", "problem": "A neuroscientist is designing an experiment to identify neurons activated by a brief, one-time novel object recognition task in mice. To do this, they plan to use immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization to detect the expression of Immediate Early Genes (IEGs), which are rapidly transcribed and translated in response to neuronal activity. The researcher is considering two of the most common IEG markers: the mRNA of the gene *Arc* (Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) and the protein product of the gene *c-Fos*.\n\nBased on established literature, the temporal dynamics of these two markers following a strong, brief stimulus are as follows:\n- **Arc mRNA**: Transcription is induced very rapidly. The level of Arc mRNA in activated neurons rises sharply, peaks approximately 30 minutes after the stimulus, and then rapidly declines.\n- **c-Fos protein**: The transcription of the *c-Fos* gene and subsequent translation of its mRNA into protein takes more time. Detectable levels of c-Fos protein begin to appear in the nucleus around 30-45 minutes after the stimulus, with the signal reaching its peak intensity approximately 90-120 minutes post-stimulus before gradually degrading.\n\nThe researcher wants to run two separate experiments. In the first, they will sacrifice the animals and collect brain tissue 30 minutes after the learning task to capture the initial wave of activation. In the second, they will collect tissue 90 minutes after the task to map the more consolidated activity pattern.\n\nWhich combination of markers would provide the most robust and reliable signal for each experimental time point?\n\nA. Arc mRNA for the 30-minute time point; c-Fos protein for the 90-minute time point.\n\nB. c-Fos protein for the 30-minute time point; Arc mRNA for the 90-minute time point.\n\nC.

At the same time, c-Fos protein is only beginning to appear and would be weaker and less reliable. Therefore, the optimal marker at 30 minutes is Arc mRNA.\n\nEvaluate the 90-minute time point: At $t=90$ minutes, c-Fos protein is at or near its peak, thus providing a robust signal. By contrast, Arc mRNA has already declined substantially from its 30-minute peak, reducing reliability. Therefore, the optimal marker at 90 minutes is c-Fos protein.\n\nMatch to the options: Arc mRNA for 30 minutes and c-Fos protein for 90 minutes corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2338813"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying which neurons were active, neuroscientists often want to know precisely which synapses on those neurons were involved in learning. Some IEGs provide this extraordinary spatial resolution, thanks to elegant cellular transport mechanisms. This practice delves into the difference between cell-wide and synapse-specific markers, highlighting why the protein Arc is uniquely suited for pinpointing activity at individual dendritic spines. [@problem_id:2338822]", "problem": "A neuroscientist is designing an experiment to visualize and quantify activity-dependent molecular changes at individual excitatory synapses on the dendrites of hippocampal neurons following a long-term potentiation protocol. The goal is to identify which specific dendritic spines were selectively activated by the stimulus. The researcher has access to techniques to visualize the protein products of two different Immediate Early Genes (IEGs): c-Fos and Arc (Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein). Both are well-established markers whose transcription is robustly upregulated by synaptic activity.\n\nAssuming the experimental goal is to achieve the highest possible spatial resolution to distinguish between active and inactive synapses on the same dendritic branch, which of the following statements provides the most accurate justification for choosing to visualize the Arc protein instead of the c-Fos protein?\n\nA. The Arc protein has a much longer half-life than the c-Fos protein, allowing for the study of long-term changes integrated over many hours.\n\nB. The expression of c-Fos is linked to cellular stress responses as well as neuronal activity, making it a less specific marker for activity-dependent processes than Arc.\n\nC. The mRNA for Arc is specifically transported to active dendritic regions and translated locally, allowing its protein product to be localized to individual active synapses.\n\nD. The transcription of the Arc gene is initiated more rapidly following neuronal depolarization than the c-Fos gene, providing a more immediate marker of recent activity.\n\nE. c-Fos is primarily a global regulator of gene expression, whereas Arc has a direct enzymatic function that immediately alters synaptic strength.", "solution": "Goal: Choose the IEG marker that yields the highest spatial resolution to distinguish active versus inactive synapses on the same dendritic branch.\n\nPrinciple: Synapse-level spatial resolution requires that the reporter (mRNA and/or protein) be targeted to and retained at the specific active synapses. This is best achieved when the mRNA is dendritically transported and locally translated at tagged, recently active spines, producing protein restricted to those synapses. In contrast, reporters whose proteins accumulate in the soma or nucleus provide cell-level, not synapse-level, localization.\n\nFacts about c-Fos: c-Fos is an immediate early gene whose protein product is a nuclear transcription factor. After induction, c-Fos protein accumulates predominantly in the nucleus, providing a cell-wide indicator of recent activity but not resolving which specific synapses were active along a dendrite. While c-Fos expression can be influenced by stress and non-synaptic stimuli, its main limitation for the stated goal is its nuclear localization and lack of synapse-specific targeting.\n\nFacts about Arc: Arc (also known as Arg3.1) is an immediate early gene whose mRNA is rapidly transcribed in the soma, dendritically transported, and targeted to active dendritic regions, where it undergoes local translation at or near recently active spines via synaptic tagging and capture mechanisms. Consequently, Arc protein can accumulate at individual active synapses, enabling spine-level mapping of activity-dependent changes on a single dendritic branch.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Incorrect and not aligned with the spatial-resolution goal. A longer half-life would integrate over longer times and blur both temporal and spatial specificity; moreover, it is not the key advantage for synapse-level localization.\n- B: Partly true that c-Fos can be induced by stress, but this does not address the decisive issue of synapse-level spatial resolution. Even a perfectly specific c-Fos readout remains primarily nuclear and therefore cell-wide, not synapse-specific.\n- C: Correct. Arc mRNA is transported to active dendrites and locally translated, restricting Arc protein to individual active synapses, which directly provides the highest spatial resolution for distinguishing active versus inactive spines on the same branch.\n- D: Incorrect focus. Even if transcription onset timing differed, onset rapidity does not confer synapse-level spatial resolution. Additionally, c-Fos is often among the earliest IEGs induced.\n- E: Incorrect. c-Fos is a transcription factor; Arc is not accurately described as having a “direct enzymatic function.” This option mischaracterizes Arc and does not articulate the mechanism that yields synapse-level spatial resolution.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate justification for choosing Arc to achieve synapse-level spatial resolution is that Arc mRNA is targeted to active dendritic regions and locally translated, localizing Arc protein to individual active synapses.\n\nNo mistakes detected in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2338822"}, {"introduction": "IEGs are not merely passive flags of activity; they are key players that actively reshape neural circuits. By regulating downstream genes, they can alter a neuron's excitability and synaptic connections for hours or days. This final practice provides a quantitative, hands-on opportunity to model how the function of the IEG *c-fos* in a specific cell type directly impacts the firing properties of a postsynaptic neuron, bridging the gap from molecular biology to circuit computation. [@problem_id:2338769]", "problem": "In cortical circuits, long-term functional changes are often mediated by activity-dependent gene expression. Immediate Early Genes (IEGs), such as *c-fos*, are rapidly transcribed following neuronal activity and act as transcription factors to orchestrate changes in synaptic strength and excitability.\n\nConsider a simplified model of a cortical circuit to investigate the role of *c-fos* in learning-induced plasticity. A single pyramidal neuron is inhibited by a population of somatostatin-positive (SST) interneurons. We can model the pyramidal neuron as a single electrical compartment governed by a set of conductances. After a learning task, there are experience-dependent changes in the inhibitory circuit.\n\nIn a wild-type (WT) animal, the learning task induces *c-fos* expression in SST interneurons, leading to a long-term potentiation of their inhibitory synapses onto the pyramidal neuron. In a conditional-knockout (cKO) animal, where *c-fos* has been selectively deleted from SST interneurons, this potentiation is absent, and the synapses instead undergo a mild depression.\n\nLet's model the state of the pyramidal neuron *after* these plastic changes have occurred. The membrane potential is determined by the balance of currents from leak channels, a constant background of excitatory inputs, and the tonic inhibition from the SST cell population.\n\nThe model is defined by the following parameters:\n- Leak conductance: $g_{leak} = 5.0$ nS\n- Background excitatory conductance: $g_{exc} = 5.0$ nS\n- Initial effective inhibitory conductance from SST cells (before learning): $G_{SST, initial} = 10.0$ nS\n- Resting potential (and leak reversal potential): $V_{rest} = -70.0$ mV\n- Excitatory reversal potential: $E_{exc} = 0.0$ mV\n- Inhibitory (GABAergic) reversal potential: $E_{GABA} = -80.0$ mV\n- Firing threshold of the pyramidal neuron: $V_{thresh} = -50.0$ mV\n\nThe learning-induced plasticity modifies the inhibitory conductance as follows:\n- In the WT animal, the final conductance is $G_{WT} = G_{SST, initial} (1 + F_{pot})$, with a potentiation factor $F_{pot} = 0.5$.\n- In the cKO animal, the final conductance is $G_{cKO} = G_{SST, initial} (1 - F_{dep})$, with a depression factor $F_{dep} = 0.2$.\n\nThis change in tonic inhibition results in different steady-state membrane potentials for the pyramidal neuron in the WT and cKO animals, both of which are below the firing threshold. To make the neuron fire, an additional excitatory conductance, $\\Delta g_{exc}$, is required to depolarize the membrane to $V_{thresh}$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the additional excitatory conductance required to bring the neuron to its firing threshold in the cKO condition compared to the WT condition, denoted as $R = \\frac{\\Delta g_{exc, cKO}}{\\Delta g_{exc, WT}}$.
