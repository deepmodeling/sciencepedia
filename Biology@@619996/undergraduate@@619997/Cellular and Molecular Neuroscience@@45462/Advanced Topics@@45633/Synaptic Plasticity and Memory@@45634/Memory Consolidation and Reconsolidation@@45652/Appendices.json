We will analyze a classic experimental design that tests the \"protein synthesis hypothesis\" of long-term memory. By examining the effect of a pharmacological agent that blocks a key signaling enzyme, Protein Kinase A (PKA), this exercise will help you understand why forming lasting memories is an active biological process that requires the synthesis of new molecules in the brain [@problem_id:2342190].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the molecular basis of long-term memory using a classical fear conditioning paradigm in mice. In this experiment, a mouse learns to associate a neutral auditory cue (a tone) with a mild, unpleasant foot shock. The formation of this long-term memory, a process known as consolidation, is known to depend on the synthesis of new proteins in the amygdala, a brain region critical for fear memories.\n\nIn the experiment, a mouse is placed in a chamber, exposed to the tone-shock pairing, and immediately afterwards receives a direct microinjection into the amygdala of a substance called H-89. H-89 is a specific inhibitor of cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A (PKA), a key enzyme in cellular signaling pathways. A separate control group of mice undergoes the exact same conditioning but receives a saline injection instead.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, both the experimental and control mice are returned to the same chamber and the auditory tone is played without the shock. The researcher measures the duration of \"freezing\" behavior, a natural fear response in rodents, as an indicator of memory recall.\n\nBased on the known molecular cascade for long-term memory consolidation, which of the following outcomes is most likely for the mouse that received the H-89 injection compared to the control mouse?\n\nA. The mouse will exhibit a significantly stronger freezing response, indicating that the inhibition of PKA enhances memory consolidation.\n\nB. The mouse will show no significant difference in a freezing response, indicating that PKA is not essential for the consolidation of this type of memory.\n\nC. The mouse will exhibit a significantly reduced freezing response, indicating that the memory of the tone-shock association was not properly consolidated into a long-term form.\n\nD. The mouse will show a normal freezing response, but will be unable to learn new tasks for the next 48 hours, indicating a general disruption of neural plasticity.", "solution": "Classical fear conditioning requires consolidation of the tone-shock association into a long-term memory trace in the amygdala, a process dependent on de novo protein synthesis. A canonical molecular pathway for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation involves the cAMP-PKA-CREB cascade: learning elevates cAMP, which activates PKA; active PKA phosphorylates nuclear targets such as CREB, promoting transcription of immediate early genes and downstream effectors that drive protein synthesis and structural synaptic changes necessary for long-term memory. \n\nH-89 is a selective inhibitor of PKA. Administered into the amygdala immediately after training, it would block PKA activation during the critical post-training consolidation window, thereby preventing CREB-mediated transcription and the protein synthesis required for long-term, but not short-term, memory. Consequently, at a 24-hour test—when performance reflects long-term memory—the mouse receiving H-89 would show impaired recall of the tone-shock association, operationalized as reduced freezing relative to saline-injected controls.\n\nEvaluating options:\n- A is incorrect because inhibiting PKA would not enhance consolidation; it would disrupt it.\n- B is incorrect because PKA is a well-established component of the consolidation machinery for amygdala-dependent fear memories.\n- C is correct: reduced freezing indicates failed consolidation into long-term memory.\n- D is incorrect because the effect is localized to the amygdala microinjection and does not generally prevent new learning across tasks; moreover, normal freezing would not be expected if consolidation in the amygdala was disrupted.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is a significantly reduced freezing response in the H-89 injected mouse.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2342190"}, {"introduction": "Once a memory is consolidated, is it permanently fixed? This exercise challenges that notion by introducing the concept of reconsolidation. You will explore a hypothetical experiment where a well-established memory is temporarily destabilized through retrieval, opening a window where it can be modified or even weakened [@problem_id:2342177]. By predicting the outcome of blocking NMDA receptors—critical for synaptic plasticity—after a memory is reactivated, you will gain insight into how our brains update and maintain memories over time.", "problem": "A research team is investigating the molecular mechanisms of memory modification. They conduct a fear conditioning experiment with two groups of rats, Group A and Group B.\n\nOn Day 1, all rats are placed in a specific chamber and are presented with an auditory tone followed by a mild foot shock. This procedure is repeated several times, leading the rats to associate the tone with the shock, a memory indicated by a \"freezing\" response (a state of immobility) upon hearing the tone.\n\nOn Day 7, the rats are returned to the same chamber. They are exposed to the auditory tone alone for a brief period, which elicits a strong freezing response, confirming the memory is intact. Immediately after this reminder session, rats in Group A are given a systemic injection of a saline solution (a control substance), while rats in Group B are given a systemic injection of a potent antagonist for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The NMDA receptor is a glutamate-gated ion channel crucial for certain forms of synaptic plasticity.\n\nOn Day 8, both groups of rats are again placed in the chamber and presented with the auditory tone. Their freezing behavior is measured to assess the strength of the fear memory.\n\nAssuming the NMDA receptor antagonist has no long-term side effects on general behavior or motor function by Day 8, predict the most likely outcome for the freezing behavior of Group B rats when compared to Group A rats on Day 8.\n\nA. The rats in Group B will show significantly enhanced freezing behavior.\n\nB. The rats in Group B will show significantly reduced freezing behavior.\n\nC. The rats in Group B will show the same level of freezing behavior.\n\nD. The rats in Group B will be unable to hear the tone due to auditory system impairment caused by the drug.\n\nE. The rats in Group B will show normal freezing initially, but the memory will fade much faster than in Group A over the subsequent hours.", "solution": "The conditioning on Day 1 creates a long-term associative memory linking the auditory tone (conditioned stimulus) to the foot shock (unconditioned stimulus), operationalized by a freezing response to the tone. On Day 7, presentation of the tone alone reactivates this memory, as evidenced by robust freezing. Memory reactivation induces a transient labile state (destabilization), after which the memory must undergo reconsolidation to persist. Reconsolidation is a form of synaptic plasticity requiring molecular processes that depend on glutamatergic signaling, including activation of the NMDA receptor.\n\nKey principle: NMDA receptor activation is crucial for plasticity processes underlying stabilization of synaptic changes. Upon retrieval, the memory enters a labile state and requires NMDA receptor–dependent processes for restabilization (reconsolidation). Blocking NMDA receptors around the reconsolidation window disrupts these plasticity mechanisms, leading to a weakening of the reactivated memory trace.\n\nIn this experiment, immediately after the reminder session on Day 7, Group A receives saline (control), so reconsolidation proceeds normally, preserving the fear memory. Group B receives a systemic NMDA receptor antagonist immediately after retrieval. Given the timing, the retrieval has already occurred, so initial expression of the memory on Day 7 is unaffected. However, the antagonist interferes with NMDA receptor–dependent processes required for reconsolidation following retrieval. Assuming no lingering non-specific behavioral or motor effects by Day 8, the expected specific effect is a weakened reactivated memory in Group B.\n\nTherefore, on Day 8, when both groups are tested with the tone, Group B should show a significantly reduced freezing response relative to Group A due to impaired reconsolidation of the fear memory. This rules out enhancement (A), no change (C), sensory impairment (D), and transient within-session decay (E), given the stated assumptions and the known role of NMDA receptors in reconsolidation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2342177"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves from interpreting experimental results to building a quantitative model, a crucial skill in modern neuroscience. We will explore the advanced hypothesis that different memory processes, like the consolidation of a new memory and the reconsolidation of an old one, might compete for a finite pool of cellular resources if they occur in the same neurons at the same time [@problem_id:2342197]. By deriving an expression for memory impairment based on a set of simplified biophysical rules, you will practice translating a complex biological idea into a precise mathematical framework and uncover how competition can shape memory strength.", "problem": "An experiment in cellular neuroscience aims to model the competition between memory consolidation and reconsolidation. The hypothesis is that when two memory traces are activated concurrently in an overlapping neuronal population, they compete for a limited intracellular pool of newly synthesized proteins required for synaptic stabilization.\n\nConsider the following simplified model:\nA long-term memory, Memory A (old), is reactivated and undergoes reconsolidation. Simultaneously, a new memory, Memory B, is formed and undergoes consolidation.\n- The neuronal ensemble for Memory A consists of $n_A$ neurons.\n- The neuronal ensemble for Memory B consists of $n_B$ neurons.\n- A subset of these neurons, numbering $n_{AB}$, are part of both ensembles (the overlap population).\n\nThe model is based on these core principles:\n1.  The final strength of a memory trace is directly proportional to the total amount of Plasticity-Related Proteins (PRPs) captured and utilized by all neurons in its ensemble. We can thus equate memory strength with the total captured PRPs.\n2.  The key limiting factor is the PRP synthesis capacity of an individual neuron. When a neuron is synaptically \"tagged\" as part of an active memory trace, it initiates synthesis of a fixed maximum amount of PRPs, which we denote as $P_{max}$.\n3.  A neuron involved in only one memory process (e.g., a neuron unique to ensemble A) contributes all its synthesized PRPs ($P_{max}$) to strengthening that single memory.\n4.  A neuron in the overlapping population ($n_{AB}$) is tagged for both processes. Its total synthesized PRPs ($P_{max}$) must be distributed between strengthening Memory A and Memory B. This distribution is proportional to the \"capture efficacy\" of the synaptic tags associated with each memory. Let $\\kappa_A$ be the capture efficacy for the reconsolidation tags of Memory A, and $\\kappa_B$ be the capture efficacy for the consolidation tags of Memory B.\n\nLet \"memory impairment\" ($I$) be the fractional loss in memory strength due to this competition, defined as $I_X = 1 - \\frac{S_X}{S_{X,0}}$, where $S_X$ is the strength of memory X in the competitive scenario and $S_{X,0}$ is its baseline strength if it were processed without competition.\n\nBased on this model, derive an expression for the ratio of the impairment of the new memory (B) to the impairment of the old memory (A), which is $\\frac{I_B}{I_A}$. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n_A$, $n_B$, $\\kappa_A$, and $\\kappa_B$.", "solution": "By principle 1, memory strength equals the total PRPs captured by all neurons in the ensemble. By principles 2–4, each tagged neuron synthesizes $P_{max}$ PRPs; a neuron unique to one memory contributes all $P_{max}$ to that memory, while an overlapping neuron divides its $P_{max}$ between A and B in proportion to the capture efficacies $\\kappa_{A}$ and $\\kappa_{B}$.\n\nCompute the strengths under competition.
