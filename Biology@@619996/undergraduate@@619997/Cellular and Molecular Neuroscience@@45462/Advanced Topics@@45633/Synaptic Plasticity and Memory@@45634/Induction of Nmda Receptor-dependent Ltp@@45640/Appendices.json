By analyzing this thought experiment, you will solidify your understanding of why both events must occur together to initiate synaptic strengthening.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity at a glutamatergic synapse in the hippocampus. This synapse is known to exhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting enhancement in signal transmission between two neurons. In a specific experiment, the researcher uses a microelectrode to inject a strong depolarizing current directly into the postsynaptic neuron, raising its membrane potential significantly. Simultaneously, they apply a pharmacological agent that completely blocks presynaptic vesicle fusion, thus preventing any release of glutamate into the synaptic cleft. Despite the strong postsynaptic depolarization, the researcher observes that LTP is not induced.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct and accurate explanation for the failure to induce LTP in this experiment?\n\nA. The strong postsynaptic depolarization paradoxically led to the inactivation of voltage-gated calcium channels, preventing the necessary calcium influx.\n\nB. The absence of glutamate meant that the ligand-binding site on the NMDA receptor was unoccupied, preventing the channel from opening despite the relief of its voltage-dependent block.\n\nC. Without presynaptic glutamate release, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors were not activated, and therefore the postsynaptic membrane could not be depolarized.\n\nD. The experimental setup failed to activate presynaptic protein kinases that are required for the synthesis of retrograde messengers.", "solution": "Induction of NMDA receptor-dependent LTP requires coincident presynaptic glutamate release and postsynaptic depolarization. Mechanistically, NMDA receptors act as coincidence detectors: they require ligand binding (glutamate and co-agonist, typically glycine or D-serine) to occupy the agonist-binding site and sufficient postsynaptic depolarization to relieve the voltage-dependent $Mg^{2+}$ block. The consequent $Ca^{2+}$ influx through open NMDA receptor channels triggers the postsynaptic signaling cascades (e.g., CaMKII activation) necessary for LTP induction.\n\nFormally, the NMDA receptor current can be represented as\n$$\nI_{\\text{NMDA}} = g_{\\text{NMDA}}(V_{m}) \\, p_{\\text{ligand}}([Glu]) \\, (V_{m} - E_{\\text{rev}}),\n$$\nwhere $g_{\\text{NMDA}}(V_{m})$ captures the voltage dependence due to $Mg^{2+}$ block, and $p_{\\text{ligand}}([Glu])$ is the ligand-gating factor that depends on glutamate binding.

Strong depolarization would not, by itself, reproduce NMDA $Ca^{2+}$ entry without ligand.\n- B is correct: without glutamate, the NMDA receptor’s ligand-binding site is unoccupied, so the channel does not open despite relief of the $Mg^{2+}$ block by depolarization.\n- C is incorrect because postsynaptic depolarization was provided directly by the electrode; lack of AMPA activation did not prevent depolarization in this protocol.\n- D is incorrect because LTP induction at NMDA-dependent synapses is primarily postsynaptic; presynaptic kinases and retrograde messengers are not the proximal cause of the induction failure under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and accurate explanation is the absence of glutamate preventing NMDA receptor opening despite depolarization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2339110"}, {"introduction": "Once the NMDA receptor detects the coincidence of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity, it opens its channel. But what is the critical signal that flows through this gate to trigger Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)? This practice problem [@problem_id:2339066] presents a hypothetical mutation that selectively removes the receptor's permeability to calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) while leaving its other functions intact. Working through this scenario will clarify the indispensable role of $Ca^{2+}$ as the second messenger that initiates the entire downstream cascade for synaptic strengthening.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating a model organism with a specific genetic mutation affecting synaptic plasticity. In this organism, the gene coding for a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is altered. The resulting mutated NMDA receptor has a modified ion pore. When glutamate is bound and the cell is sufficiently depolarized to relieve the magnesium ($Mg^{2+}$) block, this mutated receptor channel becomes permeable to sodium ions ($Na^{+}$) but is completely impermeable to calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). All other neuronal properties, including resting membrane potential, action potential generation, and the function of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, are normal.\n\nA researcher performs an experiment on a glutamatergic synapse in a brain slice from this organism. They apply a high-frequency stimulation protocol to the presynaptic neuron, a procedure which reliably induces Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) in wild-type animals. What is the most likely outcome for synaptic strength at this synapse following the stimulation?\n\nA. LTP will be induced as normal, because the influx of $Na^{+}$ through both AMPA and the mutated NMDA receptors provides the strong depolarization necessary to strengthen the synapse.\n\nB. LTP will be completely blocked, because a critical intracellular second messenger required for the induction cascade is prevented from entering the postsynaptic neuron.\n\nC. LTP will be significantly enhanced, because the absence of $Ca^{2+}$ influx prevents calcium-mediated signaling pathways that can limit the magnitude of potentiation.\n\nD. Long-Term Depression (LTD) will be induced instead of LTP, as the partial signaling through the NMDA receptor activates pathways that weaken the synapse.\n\nE. A transient, short-term potentiation will occur due to residual depolarization, but it will fail to consolidate into stable LTP.", "solution": "Normal induction of LTP at glutamatergic synapses relies on the postsynaptic coincidence detection property of NMDA receptors: glutamate binding plus sufficient depolarization (to relieve the $Mg^{2+}$ block) allows the NMDA receptor channel to conduct, and a key feature of this conductance is the influx of $Ca^{2+}$. The postsynaptic rise in $[Ca^{2+}]$ functions as the critical second messenger that binds calmodulin and activates kinases such as CaMKII (and other signaling molecules), leading to phosphorylation and insertion of AMPA receptors and other structural and biochemical changes that consolidate synaptic strengthening.\n\nIn the described mutant, when glutamate is bound and depolarization relieves the $Mg^{2+}$ block, the NMDA receptor channel is permeable to $Na^{+}$ but completely impermeable to $Ca^{2+}$. Therefore, during a high-frequency stimulation protocol that would normally induce LTP, AMPA receptors will admit $Na^{+}$ and depolarize the spine, and the mutated NMDA receptors will admit additional $Na^{+}$, further depolarizing the membrane. However, despite this depolarization, the indispensable postsynaptic $Ca^{2+}$ influx through NMDA receptors is absent. Because the induction cascade for LTP specifically requires a postsynaptic $Ca^{2+}$ elevation localized to the activated spine, the absence of $Ca^{2+}$ entry prevents activation of CaMKII-dependent and related signaling pathways necessary for LTP induction.\n\nOne might consider whether voltage-gated $Ca^{2+}$ channels could substitute due to strong depolarization. In canonical NMDA receptor–dependent LTP (such as at Schaffer collateral–CA1 synapses), the spine-confined $Ca^{2+}$ microdomain entering specifically through NMDA receptors is required; preventing $Ca^{2+}$ entry via NMDA receptors abolishes LTP under standard protocols. Thus, despite robust $Na^{+}$-mediated depolarization, the key second-messenger signal ($Ca^{2+}$) is missing, and the induction of LTP fails.\n\nEvaluating the options: \n- A is incorrect because depolarization alone without postsynaptic $Ca^{2+}$ influx through NMDA receptors does not trigger the LTP induction cascade.\n- B is correct because $Ca^{2+}$ is the critical intracellular second messenger, and its entry is blocked by the mutation.\n- C is incorrect because eliminating $Ca^{2+}$ entry abolishes, rather than enhances, LTP.\n- D is unlikely because LTD induction also depends on specific $Ca^{2+}$ signaling; complete impermeability to $Ca^{2+}$ would not favor LTD.\n- E is not the best answer in this context: although short-term presynaptic phenomena may occur due to residual presynaptic $Ca^{2+}$, the question asks for the most likely outcome for synaptic strength following an LTP-inducing protocol, and the defining outcome is that stable LTP is blocked due to loss of postsynaptic $Ca^{2+}$ influx.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that LTP is completely blocked due to the absence of postsynaptic $Ca^{2+}$ influx through NMDA receptors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2339066"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the principles of LTP conceptually is the first step; the next is to see how these principles can be used to predict synaptic changes quantitatively. This hands-on calculation [@problem_id:2339096] provides a simplified biophysical model that translates the rules of NMDA receptor activation and calcium influx into a tangible change in synaptic strength. By working through the specific timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic events, you will build a deeper appreciation for how molecular dynamics give rise to the physiological modifications underlying learning.", "problem": "Consider a single synapse on a dendritic branch of a pyramidal neuron. The synapse's strength is proportional to the number of postsynaptic Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors it contains. A long-term change in synaptic strength can be induced by specific patterns of activity, governed by calcium influx through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.\n\nWe model this process with the following biophysical rules:\n\n1.  At time $t=0$, a presynaptic action potential causes a pulse of glutamate to be released. This glutamate binds to NMDA receptors, priming them to allow ion flow for a duration of $\\tau_{glu} = 100 \\text{ ms}$ before unbinding.\n2.  At time $t = 10 \\text{ ms}$, a powerful dendritic calcium spike, originating from strong activation of other nearby synapses, arrives at the synapse. This spike clamps the local membrane potential to a value of $V_{peak} = +10 \\text{ mV}$ for a brief duration of $\\Delta t_{depol} = 5 \\text{ ms}$, after which the potential returns to its resting value of $V_{rest} = -70 \\text{ mV}$.\n3.  The fraction of NMDA receptors relieved of their voltage-dependent magnesium ($Mg^{2+}$) block, $f_{unblock}$, is a function of the membrane potential, $V_m$, given by the equation:\n    $$f_{unblock}(V_m) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_m - V_{half}}{k_V}\\right)}$$\n    where $V_{half} = -25 \\text{ mV}$ is the half-unblocking potential and $k_V = 5 \\text{ mV}$ is a slope factor.\n4.  The total quantity of calcium influx, $Q_{Ca}$, is proportional to the fraction of unblocked channels and the time duration, $T_{overlap}$, during which the channels are both glutamate-bound and the membrane is held at $V_{peak}$. The relationship is:\n    $$Q_{Ca} = C \\cdot f_{unblock}(V_{peak}) \\cdot T_{overlap}$$\n    where the constant $C = 8.0 \\times 10^5$ arbitrary units/ms.\n5.
