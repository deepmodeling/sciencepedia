Using a microelectrode, the researcher records the postsynaptic membrane potential while stimulating the presynaptic neuron. A single stimulus applied to the presynaptic axon evokes an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP), which is a transient depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, with a peak amplitude of 8.0 mV. Shortly thereafter, a second, identical stimulus is applied to the same presynaptic axon 30 milliseconds after the first one. This second stimulus evokes another EPSP with a peak amplitude of 5.6 mV.\n\nThe ratio of the second EPSP's amplitude to the first EPSP's amplitude is a critical parameter for characterizing short-term synaptic plasticity.

This is the canonical interpretation, distinguishing it from paired-pulse facilitation (which would yield a ratio greater than $1$ and is typically attributed to residual presynaptic calcium increasing release probability).

When two action potentials are elicited in the presynaptic terminal with a short delay, the response to the second pulse is smaller than the first, a phenomenon known as Paired-Pulse Depression (PPD). The scientist models this phenomenon with the following assumptions:\n\n1.  The magnitude of the postsynaptic response, measured as the Excitatory Postsynaptic Current (EPSC), is directly proportional to the number of synaptic vesicles released from the presynaptic terminal.\n2.  Neurotransmitter release is driven by the depletion of a finite pool of vesicles, known as the Readily Releasable Pool (RRP), which initially contains a total of $N$ vesicles.\n3.  The probability of release for any given vesicle in the RRP, $P_{rel}$, is directly proportional to the peak calcium influx, $C$, that occurs during a presynaptic action potential. This relationship is expressed as $P_{rel} = kC$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n4.  The time interval between the two pulses is short enough that the RRP is not replenished between pulses, but long enough that any residual calcium from the first pulse has been cleared before the second pulse arrives.\n\nUnder control conditions, the calcium influx per action potential is $C_0$. The observed Paired-Pulse Ratio (PPR), defined as the ratio of the second EPSC to the first EPSC (EPSC2/EPSC1), is measured to be 0.60.\n\nNext, a low concentration of a specific voltage-gated calcium channel blocker is applied to the synapse. This drug reduces the calcium influx associated with each action potential by 25%.\n\nAssuming the model described above holds true, calculate the new Paired-Pulse Ratio after the application of the blocker.

It is observed that when the presynaptic neuron is stimulated with a high-frequency train of action potentials, the amplitude of the resulting Postsynaptic Currents (PSCs) in the postsynaptic neuron progressively decreases, a phenomenon known as synaptic depression. Two primary hypotheses are proposed to explain this depression: (1) a presynaptic mechanism involving the depletion of readily releasable neurotransmitter vesicles, or (2) a postsynaptic mechanism involving the desensitization of glutamate receptors.\n\nTo distinguish between these possibilities, the scientist performs two separate experiments, A and B, on two different synapses of this type. In each experiment, a train of four stimuli is delivered, and for each stimulus in the train, the mean amplitude ($\\mu$) and variance ($\\sigma^2$) of the resulting PSC are meticulously measured over many identical trials.
