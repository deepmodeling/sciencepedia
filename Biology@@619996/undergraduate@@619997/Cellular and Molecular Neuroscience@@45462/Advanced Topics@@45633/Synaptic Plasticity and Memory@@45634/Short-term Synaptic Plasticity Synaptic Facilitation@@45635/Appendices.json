The amplitude of this first EPSP is measured to be 2.0 mV.\n\nThe synapse exhibits a characteristic form of short-term enhancement known as paired-pulse facilitation. This phenomenon is quantified by the paired-pulse ratio (PPR), which is defined as the ratio of the second EPSP's amplitude to the first EPSP's amplitude.

This terminal has a readily releasable pool (RRP) containing exactly one synaptic vesicle ($N=1$). When an action potential arrives, this vesicle is released with a certain probability.
