Each OSN expresses a specific type of G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) known as an Olfactory Receptor (OR). The binding of an odorant molecule to its cognate OR initiates a signaling cascade. The activated OR catalyzes the activation of a G-protein ($G_{\\text{olf}}$), which in turn activates the enzyme Adenylyl Cyclase type III (ACIII). ACIII synthesizes cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) from ATP. The increase in intracellular cAMP concentration opens cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels, leading to membrane depolarization and the generation of an action potential. The signal is terminated, in part, by the degradation of cAMP by the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE).\n\nConsider a specific OSN for which the dynamics of cAMP concentration can be modeled as follows.
