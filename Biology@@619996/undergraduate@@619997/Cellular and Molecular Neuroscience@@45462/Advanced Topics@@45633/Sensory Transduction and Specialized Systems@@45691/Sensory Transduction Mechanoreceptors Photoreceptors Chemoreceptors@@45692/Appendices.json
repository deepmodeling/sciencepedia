Gustducin is a taste-cell specific heterotrimeric G-protein whose $\\alpha$-subunit ($\\alpha$-gustducin) couples to G protein-coupled receptors mediating sweet, bitter, and umami tastes. The canonical cascade for these modalities is: ligand binds receptor (sweet: $T1R2/T1R3$; umami: $T1R1/T1R3$; bitter: $T2R$) $\\Rightarrow$ receptor acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for $G_{\\alpha}$, causing $G_{\\alpha\\text{-gustducin}}\\!\\!-\\!\\text{GDP} \\to G_{\\alpha\\text{-gustducin}}\\!\\!-\\!\\text{GTP}$ and dissociation of $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ $\\Rightarrow$ activation of $PLC\\beta_2$ $\\Rightarrow$ hydrolysis of $PIP_2$ to $IP_3$ and $DAG$ $\\Rightarrow$ $IP_3$-mediated $Ca^{2+}$ release from the endoplasmic reticulum $\\Rightarrow$ opening of TRPM5 channels and depolarization $\\Rightarrow$ ATP release to afferent fibers. Thus, sweet, bitter, and umami transduction are G-protein dependent and specifically require $\\alpha$-gustducin for normal signaling.\n\n2) Contrast with salty and sour transduction. Salty and sour tastes are mediated primarily by ionotropic mechanisms that do not require gustducin. Salty transduction depends on epithelial sodium channels (e.g., ENaC), with $Na^{+}$ influx directly depolarizing taste cells. Sour transduction depends on proton-sensitive channels (e.g., OTOP1) and proton effects on $K^{+}$ channels, where $H^{+}$ either permeates or modulates channel conductance to depolarize the cell. These pathways are not dependent on $G_{\\alpha\\text{-gustducin}}$.\n\n3) Apply the loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the $\\alpha$-subunit of gustducin. A loss-of-function of $G_{\\alpha\\text{-gustducin}}$ disrupts the GPCR-dependent cascade in step 1, abolishing or severely impairing responses to sweet, bitter, and umami ligands due to failure of $G_{\\alpha}$ activation and downstream $PLC\\beta_2\\to IP_3\\to Ca^{2+}\\to TRPM5$ signaling. Because salty and sour rely on direct ion fluxes through channels independent of gustducin, their perception remains intact.\n\n4) Map to the provided options.
