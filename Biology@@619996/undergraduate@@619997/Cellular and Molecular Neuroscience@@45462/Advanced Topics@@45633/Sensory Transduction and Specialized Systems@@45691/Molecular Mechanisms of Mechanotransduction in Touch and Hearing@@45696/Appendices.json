[@problem_id:2343690]", "problem": "A neurobiologist is studying the primary sensory neurons responsible for the sense of touch. They are working with a cultured Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neuron, which is known to express mechanosensitive ion channels in its plasma membrane. These specific channels are non-selective cation channels, meaning they allow passage of positive ions like sodium and potassium, but are impermeable to anions like chloride.\n\nThe neuron is maintained in a bathing solution that establishes a stable resting membrane potential of $V_m = -65 \\text{ mV}$. The equilibrium potentials for the major ions are as follows:\n- Sodium ($Na^{+}$): $E_{Na} = +55 \\text{ mV}$\n- Potassium ($K^{+}$): $E_{K} = -90 \\text{ mV}$\n- Chloride ($Cl^{-}$): $E_{Cl} = -70 \\text{ mV}$\n\nThe researcher uses a fine-tipped glass micropipette to apply a brief, localized mechanical force to the surface of the neuron's membrane, sufficient to open the mechanosensitive channels.

No significant net ion movement, because the inward flow of $Na^{+}$ is perfectly balanced by the outward flow of $K^{+}$.\n\nE. A net efflux of $Na^{+}$ ions, causing the membrane to hyperpolarize.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the primary ion flow and its effect on the membrane potential when mechanosensitive cation channels are opened in a DRG neuron.\n\nFirst, we must understand the concept of the electrochemical driving force, which determines the direction and magnitude of ion flow across the membrane for a given ion. The driving force ($V_{df}$) for an ion is the difference between the membrane potential ($V_m$) and the equilibrium potential for that ion ($E_{ion}$):\n$$V_{df} = V_m - E_{ion}$$\nA negative driving force for a cation indicates a net inward flow (influx), while a positive driving force for a cation indicates a net outward flow (efflux). The larger the absolute value of the driving force, the stronger the impetus for the ion to move across the membrane.\n\nThe problem states that the mechanosensitive channels are non-selective cation channels, so we need to consider the driving forces for the cations, $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$. The channels are impermeable to anions, so we can ignore $Cl^{-}$.\n\nLet's calculate the driving force for Sodium ($Na^{+}$):\nThe resting membrane potential is $V_m = -65 \\text{ mV}$ and the equilibrium potential for sodium is $E_{Na} = +55 \\text{ mV}$.\n$$V_{df, Na} = V_m - E_{Na} = (-65 \\text{ mV}) - (+55 \\text{ mV}) = -120 \\text{ mV}$$\nThe driving force for $Na^{+}$ is -120 mV. The negative sign indicates a strong tendency for positive $Na^{+}$ ions to flow into the cell.\n\nNext, let's calculate the driving force for Potassium ($K^{+}$):\nThe resting membrane potential is $V_m = -65 \\text{ mV}$ and the equilibrium potential for potassium is $E_{K} = -90 \\text{ mV}$.\n$$V_{df, K} = V_m - E_{K} = (-65 \\text{ mV}) - (-90 \\text{ mV}) = -65 \\text{ mV} + 90 \\text{ mV} = +25 \\text{ mV}$$\nThe driving force for $K^{+}$ is +25 mV. The positive sign indicates a tendency for positive $K^{+}$ ions to flow out of the cell.\n\nNow we compare the magnitudes of the driving forces. The magnitude for $Na^{+}$ is $|-120 \\text{ mV}| = 120 \\text{ mV}$, while the magnitude for $K^{+}$ is $|+25 \\text{ mV}| = 25 \\text{ mV}$. Since the channels are non-selective for these cations, the ion with the much larger driving force will dominate the current. In this case, the driving force for $Na^{+}$ influx is significantly larger than the driving force for $K^{+}$ efflux.\n\nTherefore, upon opening the channels, there will be a large net influx of positively charged $Na^{+}$ ions. The influx of positive charge into the cell will make the membrane potential less negative (i.e., move it from -65 mV towards 0 mV and more positive values). This change to a less negative membrane potential is known as depolarization.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. A net influx of $Cl^{-}$ ions, causing the membrane to hyperpolarize. This is incorrect because the channels are impermeable to anions like $Cl^{-}$.\nB. A net efflux of $K^{+}$ ions, causing the membrane to hyperpolarize. This is incorrect. While there is a small driving force for $K^{+}$ efflux, it is much smaller than the $Na^{+}$ driving force. The dominant effect will not be $K^{+}$ efflux.\nC. A net influx of $Na^{+}$ ions, causing the membrane to depolarize. This is correct. The large driving force on $Na^{+}$ leads to a significant influx of positive charge, causing depolarization.\nD. No significant net ion movement, because the inward flow of $Na^{+}$ is perfectly balanced by the outward flow of $K^{+}$. This is incorrect because the driving forces are not equal in magnitude; the $Na^{+}$ driving force is much larger.\nE. A net efflux of $Na^{+}$ ions, causing the membrane to hyperpolarize. This is incorrect. The driving force for $Na^{+}$ is inward (influx), not outward (efflux).\n\nThus, the primary and immediate result is a net influx of $Na^{+}$ that depolarizes the membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2343690"}, {"introduction": "Moving from general principles to a specific and critical example, we now examine the molecular basis of hearing. The TMC1 protein forms the mechanotransduction channel in cochlear hair cells, and its proper function is essential for sound perception. This thought experiment asks you to deduce the most direct functional consequence of a hypothetical mutation in the channel's pore region, forcing a precise consideration of protein structure-function relationships and their profound impact on human physiology. [@problem_id:2343704]", "problem": "In the mammalian cochlea, the conversion of mechanical sound vibrations into neural signals is performed by specialized inner hair cells. These cells possess a bundle of stereocilia on their apical surface, which are interconnected by fine protein filaments known as tip links. Mechanical deflection of the stereocilia bundle, caused by sound-induced fluid motion, creates tension in the tip links. This tension directly gates open mechanosensitive ion channels located at the tips of the stereocilia.\n\nThe primary protein forming this channel is Transmembrane Channel-Like 1 (TMC1). When the TMC1 channel opens, it allows a rapid influx of cations, predominantly potassium ($K^{+}$) and some calcium ($Ca^{2+}$), from the surrounding high-potassium fluid called the endolymph. This influx of positive charge generates a receptor potential that depolarizes the hair cell, initiating the signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the perception of sound.\n\nConsider a specific point mutation in the gene encoding the TMC1 protein. This mutation results in a single amino acid substitution within the channel's pore region, which is the narrowest part of the channel that lines the ion conduction pathway and determines its selectivity and conductance. Individuals homozygous for this mutation are born with profound congenital deafness.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following provides the most direct and accurate functional reason for the deafness caused by this pore region mutation?\n\nA. The mutation alters the structure of the pore, physically obstructing or electrostatically repelling cations, thus preventing ion flow even when the channel's mechanical gate is opened by tip link tension.\n\nB. The mutation causes the TMC1 protein to misfold and be targeted for degradation, preventing its insertion into the stereocilia membrane.\n\nC. The mutation disrupts the binding site for the tip link, meaning mechanical force can no longer be transmitted to the channel to cause it to open.\n\nD. The mutation causes the channel to become \"leaky\" and remain permanently open, leading to a constant influx of ions that results in excitotoxic cell death of the hair cells before birth.\n\nE. The mutation alters the channel's function such that it no longer triggers the downstream machinery responsible for synaptic vesicle release at the base of the hair cell, even though depolarization occurs normally.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most direct functional reason why a point mutation in the pore region of the TMC1 mechanotransduction channel causes profound deafness. Let's analyze the process of mechanotransduction and the likely effect of such a mutation.\n\n1.  **The fundamental process of hearing transduction:** Sound causes mechanical vibration, which deflects the stereocilia of hair cells. This deflection puts tension on the tip links connecting the stereocilia. The tension pulls open the TMC1 ion channels.\n\n2.  **Function of the TMC1 channel:** The open TMC1 channel provides a pathway for cations ($K^{+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$) to flow from the endolymph into the hair cell. This flow of positive charge is an electrical current known as the mechanotransduction current.\n\n3.  **Consequence of the current:** This inward current depolarizes the hair cell membrane from its resting potential. This depolarization is the receptor potential, the primary electrical signal that encodes the sound stimulus. If this initial step fails, the entire downstream process of neurotransmitter release and auditory nerve activation cannot occur.\n\n4.  **Role of the \"pore region\":** The pore region is the critical part of an ion channel that forms the actual conduit for ions. Its structure, size, and the chemical properties (e.g., charge) of its constituent amino acids determine which ions can pass through (selectivity) and how quickly they can pass through (conductance).\n\n5.  **Impact of a pore region mutation:** A mutation in this specific region is most likely to directly affect the ability of ions to pass through the channel. It could physically constrict the pore, making it too narrow for hydrated $K^{+}$ or $Ca^{2+}$ ions. Alternatively, it could change the electrostatic environment, for example, by introducing a positively charged amino acid residue that repels the positively charged cations, effectively blocking their passage. In either case, the primary function of the pore—ion conduction—is compromised.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the options:**\n    *   **A. The mutation alters the structure of the pore, physically obstructing or electrostatically repelling cations, thus preventing ion flow even when the channel's mechanical gate is opened by tip link tension.** This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The mechanical gating mechanism (pulling by the tip link) might still be intact, but if the pore itself is non-functional, no current can flow. This failure at the most fundamental step of transduction—the generation of a current—directly and completely explains the profound deafness.\n    *   **B. The mutation causes the TMC1 protein to misfold and be targeted for degradation, preventing its insertion into the stereocilia membrane.** While some mutations can lead to misfolding and trafficking defects, a mutation specifically in the pore region is most directly linked to a conduction defect. This option describes a problem with protein synthesis/localization, not the channel's intrinsic function once it's in the membrane. It is a possible but less direct consequence compared to A.\n    *   **C. The mutation disrupts the binding site for the tip link, meaning mechanical force can no longer be transmitted to the channel to cause it to open.** This describes a defect in the gating mechanism. Such a defect would more likely be caused by a mutation in the extracellular domains of the TMC1 protein that interact with the tip link, not in the internal pore-lining region.\n    *   **D. The mutation causes the channel to become \"leaky\" and remain permanently open, leading to a constant influx of ions that results in excitotoxic cell death.** This describes a gain-of-function mutation. While such mutations can cause deafness, a simple loss-of-function (blockage) as described in A is a more common and direct consequence of a structural change in a channel's pore. A blocked pore directly leads to a lack of signaling, which is a straightforward cause for congenital deafness.\n    *   **E. The mutation alters the channel's function such that it no longer triggers the downstream machinery for synaptic vesicle release...even though depolarization occurs normally.** This is incorrect because it states that depolarization occurs normally. The primary function of the TMC1 channel is to *cause* depolarization by allowing ion influx. It is not directly involved in the mechanics of vesicle release at the other end of the cell. If depolarization fails, vesicle release will fail as a consequence, not as a separate defect.\n\nTherefore, the most direct explanation is that the mutation renders the pore impassable to ions, thereby abolishing the mechanotransduction current and preventing the hair cell from ever generating a signal in response to sound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2343704"}, {"introduction": "Our sense of touch is not monolithic; it is a composite of signals from various specialized mechanoreceptors, each tuned to different features of a stimulus.

Temperature (hot and cold) intact and sharp, pinprick pain intact. These modalities are mediated by free nerve endings (thermo- and nociceptors). Therefore, free nerve endings are functional, so option E is unlikely to be dysfunctional.\n2. Detection of deep, transient pressure and high-frequency vibration at approximately 256 Hz is preserved. High-frequency vibration (on the order of 200 to 300 Hz) and deep pressure are characteristic of Pacinian corpuscles. Therefore, Pacinian corpuscles are functional, so option B is unlikely to be dysfunctional.\n3. Profound inability to distinguish fine textures when lightly stroking surfaces and difficulty detecting the initial slip of a smooth, held object. The initial slip during grip and low-frequency flutter during light stroking are mediated by rapidly adapting, low-threshold mechanoreceptors with small receptive fields in glabrous skin, specifically Meissner’s corpuscles. Meissner’s corpuscles are specialized for:\n   - Low-frequency vibration (flutter, roughly tens of Hz),\n   - Motion across the skin during light touch,\n   - Detection of initial slip, providing feedback for grip control,\n   - Discrimination of surface texture during light stroking.\nBy contrast, Merkel’s disks (slowly adapting type I) encode static pressure, edges, points, and fine spatial details (e.g., Braille) under stationary contact, rather than dynamic slip detection; Ruffini endings (slowly adapting type II) respond to skin stretch and contribute to hand shape and finger position, not primarily to initial slip or high sensitivity to fine textures under light stroking.\n\nLogical deductions:\n- Since high-frequency vibration and deep transient pressure are preserved, Pacinian corpuscles are intact (excludes B).\n- Since pain and temperature are intact, free nerve endings are intact (excludes E).\n- The key deficits—failure to detect initial slip and poor fine texture discrimination with light stroking—are hallmark deficits of Meissner’s corpuscles (rapidly adapting type I), not Merkel’s disks or Ruffini endings. Merkel dysfunction would more prominently impair static edge/point discrimination and two-point discrimination in stationary touch tasks; Ruffini dysfunction would more prominently affect skin stretch and finger position rather than initial slip.\n\nTherefore, the most likely dysfunctional class is Meissner’s corpuscles.\n\nHence, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2343698"}]}
