This protein is expressed within a specific population of neurons and dramatically increases its fluorescence upon binding to free intracellular calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$).\n\nIn a control experiment, a target neuron in a standard physiological saline solution is stimulated via an electrode to fire a single action potential. A microscope monitoring the neuron's soma detects a rapid, transient, and large increase in GCaMP fluorescence, which then returns to its baseline level.\n\nNext, the researcher replaces the standard saline with an experimental solution that is identical in every way, except that it contains zero free extracellular calcium ($[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{out}} = 0$). After allowing the neuron to equilibrate in this new solution, it is stimulated with the same electrode to fire another single action potential.\n\nAssuming the neuron is still capable of firing a sodium-potassium based action potential, which of the following outcomes best describes the expected GCaMP fluorescence signal in the neuron's soma immediately following the action potential in the zero-calcium experimental solution?\n\nA.

A standard equilibrium description is that the fractional occupancy is $\\theta = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{in}}}{K_{d} + [Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{in}}}$, and the fluorescence $\\mathcal{F}$ increases with $\\theta$. Thus, an increase in $\\mathcal{F}$ requires a transient increase in $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{in}}$.\n\nIn the control saline, a single action potential depolarizes the membrane and opens voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). With nonzero $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{out}}$, the electrochemical gradient drives an inward $Ca^{2+}$ current, transiently increasing $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{in}}$, hence increasing $\\theta$ and $\\mathcal{F}$. This is consistent with the observed rapid, large fluorescence transient.\n\nIn the zero-calcium external solution, $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{out}} = 0$. The neuron can still generate a sodium-potassium action potential, so depolarization still opens VGCCs. However, without external $Ca^{2+}$, there can be no inward $Ca^{2+}$ flux. A constant-field (Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz) form for the $Ca^{2+}$ flux through open channels is\n$$\nJ_{Ca} = P_{Ca} z^{2} \\frac{V F^{2}}{R T} \\frac{[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{in}} - [Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{out}} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{z F V}{R T}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{z F V}{R T}\\right)} \\, ,\n$$\nwith $z=2$.

Given that baseline $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{in}}$ is very low and heavily buffered, and the spike is brief, this outward flux produces at most a very small decrease in free $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{in}}$.\n\nBecause $\\mathcal{F}$ increases with $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{in}}$, the absence of inward $Ca^{2+}$ influx means there will be no rapid, large fluorescence increase. A significant increase from internal stores would require a trigger such as calcium-induced calcium release; with no $Ca^{2+}$ entry during a single action potential, such release is not expected in typical neuronal soma. GCaMP is not voltage-sensitive, so there is no direct tracking of membrane voltage. Therefore, immediately following the action potential in zero external calcium, the best expectation is no significant change in GCaMP fluorescence relative to baseline (any tiny decrease from outward $Ca^{2+}$ flux would be below typical detection thresholds for a single spike).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2336389"}, {"introduction": "Calcium signals are much slower than the millisecond-fast action potentials that cause them, posing a challenge for decoding rapid neural communication.
