One such protein is halorhodopsin, a light-driven chloride pump that transports chloride ions (Cl‚Åª) into the cell, typically causing hyperpolarization and inhibiting neuronal firing. However, the net effect of this inhibition can be modulated by the neuron's intrinsic ionic currents.\n\nConsider two types of a model neuron, both initially at a resting membrane potential of $V_{rest} = -65$ mV and having an action potential threshold of $V_{th} = -50$ mV.\n- **Neuron A** is a simple neuron that lacks any significant voltage-gated currents near rest.\n- **Neuron B** is identical to Neuron A but also expresses a prominent hyperpolarization-activated cation current, known as $I_h$.\n\nUpon sustained illumination with the correct wavelength of light, the halorhodopsin expressed in both neurons is strongly activated.\n- In Neuron A, this activation drives the membrane potential to a new steady-state hyperpolarized value of $V_{hyper} = -78$ mV.\n- In Neuron B, the hyperpolarization activates the $I_h$ current.
