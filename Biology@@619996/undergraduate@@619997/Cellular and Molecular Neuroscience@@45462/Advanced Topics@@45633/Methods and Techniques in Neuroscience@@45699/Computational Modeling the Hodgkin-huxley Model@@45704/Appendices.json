By exploring a hypothetical mutation that changes this exponent to $n^2$, you will gain a powerful intuition for how the model's mathematical details translate directly into physiological function and spike timing.", "problem": "The Hodgkin-Huxley model provides a mathematical description of how action potentials are initiated and propagated in neurons. The model describes the flow of ions through voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels. The total potassium current ($I_K$) is given by the equation:\n\n$$I_K = \\bar{g}_K n^{4} (V - E_K)$$\n\nHere, $\\bar{g}_K$ is the maximum possible conductance of potassium ions, $V$ is the membrane potential, and $E_K$ is the Nernst equilibrium potential for potassium. The term $n$ is a dimensionless \"activation gating variable\" that ranges from 0 to 1, representing the probability of a single gating subunit being in its permissive state. The exponent $4$ signifies that four such independent subunits must be in the permissive state for the channel to open and conduct ions.\n\nImagine a hypothetical neuron where a mutation has altered the structure of its voltage-gated potassium channels. In this mutant neuron, only two gating subunits are required to be in the permissive state for the channel to open. The potassium current in this neuron is thus described by the modified equation:\n\n$$I_{K, \\text{mutant}} = \\bar{g}_K n^{2} (V - E_K)$$\n\nAssume that all other parameters of the neuron, including the properties of the sodium channels, the maximum conductance $\\bar{g}_K$, the equilibrium potentials, and the voltage-dependent kinetics of the gating variable $n$ itself (i.e., the functions that determine how $n$ changes with voltage and time), are identical to those in a normal neuron.\n\nBased on this single change to the potassium channel dynamics, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected alteration to the repolarization phase of a single action potential in the mutant neuron compared to a normal one?\n\nA. Repolarization will be slower and more prolonged, and the afterhyperpolarization will be less pronounced.\n\nB.

Consequently:\n- The total conductance $\\bar{g}_{K} n^{p} + g_{L}$ is larger in the mutant, so $\\tau$ is smaller. A smaller $\\tau$ implies a faster change in $V$, hence faster repolarization.\n- The fixed point $V_{\\infty}$ is more strongly weighted toward $E_{K}$ in the mutant because the numerator and denominator are more dominated by the potassium term. This pulls $V$ closer to $E_{K}$ during the tail of the action potential, producing a deeper (more negative) afterhyperpolarization.\n\nAlthough $n$ obeys the same kinetics,\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt} = \\alpha_{n}(V)\\,(1-n) - \\beta_{n}(V)\\,n,\n$$\nthe only change we introduced is the exponent $p$ in the current; the larger potassium current for the same $n$ accelerates repolarization and deepens the afterhyperpolarization as argued above.
