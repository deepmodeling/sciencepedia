Before any behavioral or physiological experiments can be interpreted, one must first confirm whether the animal is a wild-type, heterozygous, or homozygous for the genetic modification. This practice problem guides you through the interpretation of a Western blot, a fundamental biochemical technique used to identify specific proteins and confirm the molecular outcome of a gene knockout, linking the genetic code to its protein product [@problem_id:2354488].", "problem": "Researchers are investigating a hypothetical protein called \"NeuroStabilin\" (NS), which is believed to play a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of synapses. In its normal, wild-type form, the NS protein has a molecular weight of 50 kDa. To study its function, a knockout mouse model was created. In this model, the gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which has a molecular weight of 27 kDa, was inserted into the middle of the *NeuroStabilin* gene. This insertion disrupts the function of the NS protein and creates a new, non-functional NS-GFP fusion protein.\n\nA neuroscientist prepares brain tissue lysates from three different mice: Mouse A, Mouse B, and Mouse C. These lysates are subjected to Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to separate the proteins by size, followed by a Western blot analysis. The blot is probed with a specific antibody that recognizes the C-terminal region of the NeuroStabilin protein. This C-terminal region is encoded by a part of the gene that remains intact and is expressed in both the wild-type protein and the NS-GFP fusion protein. The results of the Western blot are described as follows:\n\n-   The lane corresponding to **Mouse A** shows a single, distinct band at 50 kDa.\n-   The lane corresponding to **Mouse B** shows a single, distinct band at 77 kDa.\n-   The lane corresponding to **Mouse C** shows two distinct bands: one at 50 kDa and another at 77 kDa.\n\nUsing the standard notation where `+/+` represents a wild-type genotype, `+/-` represents a heterozygous genotype, and `-/-` represents a homozygous knockout genotype, determine the genotype for each of the three mice.\n\nA.

This \"knock-in\" approach is a powerful tool for testing precise hypotheses about protein structure and function. This exercise challenges you to predict the functional consequences of a targeted mutation in a voltage-gated ion channel, connecting the biochemical properties of an amino acid to the bioelectric current it controls, as measured by a voltage-clamp recording [@problem_id:2354419].", "problem": "A team of neuroscientists is investigating a novel voltage-gated sodium channel, which they have named *Nav-K*, responsible for the rising phase of the action potential in a specific type of neuron. From structural studies, they hypothesize that the fast inactivation of *Nav-K* is mediated by a \"ball-and-chain\" mechanism. This mechanism involves an intracellular loop that acts as an inactivation gate, or \"ball,\" which physically occludes the channel pore shortly after it opens. The critical part of this \"ball\" is believed to be a highly conserved tri-peptide motif: Isoleucine-Phenylalanine-Methionine (IFM). The hydrophobic nature of these amino acids is thought to be crucial for the inactivation gate to bind within the inner vestibule of the channel pore.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the scientists use genetic engineering to create a knock-in mouse model. In this model, the gene encoding the *Nav-K* channel is altered such that the Phenylalanine (F) residue in the IFM motif is replaced with a Glutamic acid (E) residue. They then prepare acute brain slices from both wild-type (WT) and the knock-in (mutant) mice and perform whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings on the specific neurons expressing *Nav-K*.\n\nIn the experiment, a neuron is held at a membrane potential of -90 mV and then subjected to a single, sustained depolarizing step to 0 mV for a duration of 50 milliseconds. This step is sufficient to cause robust activation of the *Nav-K* channels. Which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected macroscopic sodium current recorded from a neuron of the knock-in mutant mouse compared to that from a wild-type neuron?\n\nA. The amplitude of the peak sodium current will be approximately zero, as the channels will fail to open.\n\nB. The sodium current will activate and inactivate with kinetics and amplitude that are indistinguishable from the wild-type current.\n\nC. The sodium current will activate, but the rate of inactivation will be significantly slower, resulting in a persistent inward current throughout the 50 ms depolarization.\n\nD. The sodium current will activate normally but will inactivate significantly faster than the wild-type current.\n\nE. The channel will lose its selectivity, resulting in a net outward potassium current instead of an inward sodium current.", "solution": "Voltage-gated sodium channel macroscopic current during a voltage step can be described as\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}}(t)=\\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\,m(t)^{p}\\,h(t)\\,\\left(V-E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ is the maximal conductance, $m(t)$ is the activation gating variable, $h(t)$ is the fast inactivation gating variable, $p$ is the activation power (commonly $p=3$ for sodium channels in a Hodgkin-Huxley formulation), $V$ is the command voltage, and $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ is the sodium reversal potential. During a step from $-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $m(t)$ rapidly approaches its steady-state value near unity on the order of a millisecond, while $h(t)$ declines toward zero with the fast inactivation time constant, thereby producing a transient inward current that quickly inactivates in wild-type channels.\n\nFast inactivation in voltage-gated sodium channels is mediated by the intracellular DIII-DIV linker that contains the conserved IFM (Isoleucine-Phenylalanine-Methionine) motif. The hydrophobic side chains, particularly the phenylalanine, are critical for the \"ball-and-chain\"-like occlusion of the inner pore immediately after opening. Substituting phenylalanine with glutamic acid (F to E) introduces a negatively charged, hydrophilic side chain in place of a bulky hydrophobic aromatic residue, disrupting hydrophobic interactions with the inner vestibule. In kinetic terms, this primarily reduces the effective transition rate from the open to the inactivated state, equivalently slowing the decay of $h(t)$ during depolarization.\n\nConsequently, upon a depolarizing step to $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, activation remains largely intact (the voltage sensors and activation gate are not directly compromised by the IFM mutation), so $m(t)$ still rises rapidly, and channels open. However, inactivation is impaired: $h(t)$ declines more slowly and often does not approach zero within the step duration. Therefore, compared to wild-type, the macroscopic current still activates but decays much more slowly, leaving a sustained nonzero value of $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}(t)$ throughout the $50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ pulse. Because $V-E_{\\mathrm{Na}}<0$ at $V=0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, this persistent current remains inward.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the mutation targets fast inactivation rather than activation gating; channels still open and conduct.\n- B is incorrect because fast inactivation kinetics are altered by disrupting the IFM-mediated occlusion.\n- C is correct: activation occurs, inactivation is significantly slower, and a persistent inward current is observed during the $50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ depolarization.\n- D is the opposite of the expected effect; the mutation slows, not accelerates, fast inactivation.\n- E is incorrect because ion selectivity arises from the selectivity filter (e.g., the DEKA motif), not the IFM inactivation particle; there is no basis for a switch to an outward potassium current.\n\nThus, the mutant will show activation with markedly slowed inactivation and a sustained inward current during the depolarizing step.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2354419"}, {"introduction": "Genetically modified animals are invaluable for dissecting complex signaling pathways within the nervous system. However, interpreting the results requires careful logical reasoning, especially when multiple components can interact. This problem explores how comparing two different knockout models—one for a signaling molecule (the ligand) and one for its receptor—can help untangle a pathway's function and reveal the effects of pharmacological interventions, a common strategy in neuroscience research [@problem_id:2354445].", "problem": "A team of neuroscientists is investigating a newly discovered neuropeptide called \"Hypocretin-3\" (Hcrt-3), which is hypothesized to play a crucial role in promoting wakefulness. They find that Hcrt-3 exerts its effects by binding to a specific G-protein coupled receptor, the Hcrt-3 Receptor (HcrtR3). To further elucidate this pathway, the researchers generate two distinct lines of transgenic mice:\n\n1.  `Hcrt-3-KO`: A knockout mouse line in which the gene for Hcrt-3 is deleted, preventing the synthesis of the neuropeptide.\n2.  `HcrtR3-KO`: A knockout mouse line in which the gene for the HcrtR3 receptor is deleted, rendering the mice unable to produce this specific receptor.\n\nSubsequent research reveals a complicating factor: another endogenous peptide, which we will call \"Modulin-A,\" is also capable of binding to and weakly activating the HcrtR3 receptor, similarly promoting a state of wakefulness, though with much lower potency than Hcrt-3.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following experimental outcomes would be uniquely observed in the `Hcrt-3-KO` mice but **NOT** in the `HcrtR3-KO` mice?\n\nA. The mice exhibit a phenotype characterized by excessive sleepiness (narcolepsy), and this phenotype is more severe than what would be observed if only Hcrt-3 signaling were absent.\n\nB. Direct administration of a potent, synthetic HcrtR3 receptor agonist into the brain successfully alleviates the sleepiness phenotype and promotes wakefulness.\n\nC. The mice show a complete inability to respond to any compound that targets the HcrtR3 receptor.\n\nD. Both knockout lines display an identical increase in total sleep time compared to wild-type mice.\n\nE. Blocking the synthesis of Modulin-A has no effect on the sleep-wake cycle of the mice.", "solution": "Principle of ligand-receptor signaling: a physiological response via a receptor requires the presence of the receptor and an activating ligand; removal of the ligand can sometimes be compensated by alternative endogenous ligands or exogenous agonists, whereas removal of the receptor abolishes responses to all ligands targeting that receptor.\n\nDefine pathway: Hcrt-3 promotes wakefulness by binding to HcrtR3. Modulin-A can also bind and weakly activate HcrtR3.\n\nHcrt-3-KO line: The endogenous ligand Hcrt-3 is absent, but HcrtR3 remains present. Therefore:\n- Endogenous signaling is reduced but not abolished because Modulin-A can still weakly activate HcrtR3.\n- Exogenous pharmacological activation using a potent HcrtR3 agonist can still drive receptor signaling and promote wakefulness because the receptor is intact.\n\nHcrtR3-KO line: The receptor is absent. Therefore:\n- Neither Hcrt-3 nor Modulin-A can signal through HcrtR3; endogenous signaling via this pathway is abolished.\n- Any exogenous compound that targets HcrtR3 cannot elicit an effect because the receptor is missing.\n- Blocking Modulin-A has no effect on this pathway because the receptor is absent regardless of ligand availability.\n\nOption analysis:\nA. A phenotype more severe than loss of Hcrt-3 signaling alone would be characteristic of HcrtR3-KO, not Hcrt-3-KO, because HcrtR3-KO also eliminates Modulin-A signaling through HcrtR3. Not unique to Hcrt-3-KO.\nB. Direct administration of a potent HcrtR3 agonist would alleviate sleepiness only if HcrtR3 is present (true in Hcrt-3-KO) and would fail if HcrtR3 is absent (true in HcrtR3-KO). This is uniquely observed in Hcrt-3-KO.\nC. Complete inability to respond to any HcrtR3-targeting compound is a defining feature of HcrtR3-KO, not Hcrt-3-KO.\nD. Identical increases in sleep time are inconsistent with the residual Modulin-A signaling preserved in Hcrt-3-KO but absent in HcrtR3-KO. Not correct.\nE. Blocking Modulin-A having no effect would be true in HcrtR3-KO (no receptor), but in Hcrt-3-KO it would remove residual signaling and thus affect the phenotype. Not unique to Hcrt-3-KO.\n\nTherefore, the outcome uniquely observed in Hcrt-3-KO but not in HcrtR3-KO is the rescue of wakefulness by a direct HcrtR3 agonist.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2354445"}]}
