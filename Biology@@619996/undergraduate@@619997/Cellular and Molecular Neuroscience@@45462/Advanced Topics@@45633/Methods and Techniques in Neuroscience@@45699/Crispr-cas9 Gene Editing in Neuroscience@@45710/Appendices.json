{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The most direct application of CRISPR-Cas9 is to inactivate a gene, a process known as a 'knockout'. This is often achieved by guiding the Cas9 enzyme to cut the DNA within a gene's coding sequence and relying on the cell's error-prone repair pathway, Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), to introduce a mutation that renders the resulting protein non-functional. This exercise challenges you to think like an experimentalist and choose the most effective strategy for knocking out a gene to study its role in neuronal excitability, a foundational technique in cellular neuroscience. [@problem_id:2332832]", "problem": "A junior researcher in a cellular neuroscience lab is tasked with investigating the specific contribution of the Nav1.7 voltage-gated sodium channel to action potential generation in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons. The protein Nav1.7 is encoded by the gene *SCN9A*. The researcher plans to use the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to functionally disable this gene.\n\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 system utilizes two main components: the Cas9 nuclease, an enzyme that cuts DNA, and a guide RNA (gRNA), which directs the Cas9 to a specific target sequence in the genome. For the widely used *Streptococcus pyogenes* Cas9, binding and cleavage require the presence of a specific sequence known as the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), which has the sequence NGG (where N is any nucleotide), located immediately downstream of the target DNA sequence. Once Cas9 creates a double-strand break, the cell's own repair machinery is activated. One such pathway is Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), an error-prone process that often introduces small insertions or deletions at the break site.\n\nThe researcher's goal is to achieve a gene *knockout*, which means permanently inactivating the *SCN9A* gene so that it no longer produces a functional Nav1.7 protein. Which of the following strategies represents the most direct and effective molecular approach to achieve this knockout?\n\nA. Transfect the neurons with plasmids encoding the Cas9 nuclease and a gRNA designed to target a sequence within an early exon of the *SCN9A* gene, with the intention of inducing a frameshift mutation via the NHEJ pathway.\n\nB. Transfect the neurons with plasmids encoding the Cas9 nuclease and a gRNA designed to target the promoter region of the *SCN9A* gene to permanently block the binding of RNA polymerase.\n\nC. Transfect the neurons with a plasmid encoding only a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that is complementary to the *SCN9A* messenger RNA (mRNA), aiming to trigger its degradation.\n\nD. Transfect the neurons with plasmids encoding the Cas9 nuclease, a gRNA targeting a mutated region of *SCN9A*, and a separate DNA donor template containing the wild-type *SCN9A* sequence.\n\nE. Transfect the neurons with a plasmid encoding only the Cas9 nuclease, allowing it to randomly scan the genome and cleave the *SCN9A* gene by chance.", "solution": "Goal: permanently inactivate the gene so it no longer produces a functional protein (a gene knockout). With SpCas9, the nuclease requires a PAM of the form NGG immediately downstream of the target site. Cas9 introduces a double-strand break; repair by Non-Homologous End Joining is error-prone and often creates small insertions or deletions. If these indels occur within an early coding exon, they frequently cause a frameshift, leading to premature stop codons and loss of function via truncated protein and/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This is the standard, direct strategy for CRISPR knockout.\n\nEvaluate options:\nA. Cas9 plus a gRNA targeting an early exon to induce indels by NHEJ is the canonical approach to produce frameshift mutations that inactivate the coding sequence. This directly achieves a knockout.\nB. Targeting the promoter may create indels that alter transcription factor binding, but effects are variable and may yield partial reduction rather than complete loss; it is less direct and less reliable for a knockout than disrupting the coding sequence.\nC. An shRNA depletes mRNA post-transcriptionally, producing a knockdown, not a permanent DNA-level knockout.\nD. Providing a donor with the wild-type sequence promotes homology-directed repair that corrects mutations rather than disables the gene; this would tend to restore, not eliminate, function.\nE. Cas9 without a gRNA lacks sequence specificity and will not reliably or effectively cleave the intended locus; it is not a viable strategy.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and effective molecular approach to achieve a knockout is in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2332832"}, {"introduction": "While creating simple knockouts is powerful, the true elegance of CRISPR-Cas9 comes from its ability to make precise edits using a different cellular mechanism called Homology-Directed Repair (HDR). However, guiding the cell to use HDR is significantly less efficient than the default NHEJ pathway.

They hypothesize that the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of a postsynaptic protein, which they have named Synaptic Scaffolding Factor-X (SSF-X), is critical for anchoring neurotransmitter receptors at the synapse. To test this, they plan to use the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to precisely delete the coding sequence for this motif from the SSF-X gene in a primary neuronal culture.\n\nThe experimental plan is as follows:\n1.  A total of $N_0 = 5.0 \\times 10^5$ neurons are cultured.\n2.  The neurons are co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the Cas9 nuclease and a specific single guide RNA (sgRNA), along with a synthetic single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) that will serve as a repair template.\n3.  The sgRNA is designed to direct the Cas9 nuclease to create a Double-Strand Break (DSB) 3 base pairs upstream of the sequence encoding the SSF-X PDZ-binding motif.\n4.  The ssODN repair template is designed to introduce a premature stop codon at the DSB site and contains homology arms that match the sequences flanking the break. This design ensures that if repair occurs via Homology-Directed Repair (HDR), the targeted motif sequence is deleted.\n5.  The overall efficiency of transfection, meaning the fraction of cells that successfully take up all the required molecular components, is $\\eta_{trans} = 0.60$.\n6.  In the subpopulation of successfully transfected cells, the probability that the Cas9 nuclease creates a DSB at the correct genomic locus on at least one of the two alleles is $P_{DSB} = 0.85$.\n7.  For a cell that has incurred a DSB, the break can be repaired by one of two major pathways: the desired HDR or the error-prone Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ). The probability of HDR, $P_{HDR}$, is dependent on the concentration of the ssODN template, $[S]$. This relationship is empirically modeled by the equation:\n    $$P_{HDR} = \\frac{K [S]}{1 + K [S]}$$\n    where $K = 0.50 \\text{ L}/\\mu\\text{mol}$ is a constant related to the repair machinery's affinity for the template.

These mice are then treated with tamoxifen to induce expression.", "solution": "Goal: Express the mutant Synaptostatin protein only in cerebellar Purkinje cells, only in adulthood, and only upon tamoxifen administration.\n\nDesign constraints and principles:\n- Cell-type specificity is achieved by restricting Cre activity or promoter activity to Purkinje cells. The Pcp2 promoter drives expression specifically in Purkinje cells, so placing Cre under Pcp2 ensures Cre is present only in Purkinje cells.\n- Temporal control by tamoxifen requires Cre-ERt2, which remains cytoplasmic and inactive until tamoxifen binding causes nuclear translocation and recombinase activity.\n- Conditional activation of the transgene uses an LSL cassette placed between a promoter and the coding sequence; Cre excision removes the stop, enabling downstream expression.\n- Robust expression after activation is commonly achieved using a strong, ubiquitous promoter such as CAG. Placing the transgene under CAG after LSL ensures high expression once the stop is excised.\n- Targeting the ROSA26 locus via CRISPR-Cas9 provides a safe harbor site for stable, predictable expression without disrupting endogenous genes.\n\nEvaluate each option against these requirements:\n\nOption A: Two lines crossed. Line 1: Pcp2-driven Cre-ERt2 (Purkinje-specific, tamoxifen-inducible recombinase). Line 2: ROSA26::CAG-LSL-mSyn (safe harbor insertion; expression blocked by LSL until Cre excision; strong CAG drives expression after excision). Upon tamoxifen administration in adults, Cre-ERt2 becomes active only in Purkinje cells, excises LSL, and enables CAG-driven mSyn expression exclusively in those cells, at the chosen time. This satisfies cell specificity, temporal control, and precise genomic insertion with robust expression.\n\nOption B: Replace endogenous Synaptostatin with mSyn cDNA using CRISPR-Cas9. There is no Cre system here, so tamoxifen has no mechanism to control expression. Expression would follow the endogenous gene’s spatiotemporal pattern, failing both Purkinje-cell exclusivity and adult inducibility.\n\nOption C: Two lines crossed. Line 1: CAG-driven Cre-ERt2 (ubiquitous, tamoxifen-inducible recombinase). Line 2: ROSA26::Pcp2-LSL-mSyn. Upon tamoxifen, Cre-ERt2 is activated in all cells, excising LSL ubiquitously. Although expression still requires Pcp2 promoter activity and would be largely Purkinje-specific, recombination would occur genome-wide, permanently altering the reporter locus in all cells and potentially recombining other floxed alleles. This is less precise and introduces unnecessary off-target recombination risk compared to restricting Cre-ERt2 to Purkinje cells. Moreover, Pcp2 promoter within a ROSA26 knock-in may not match native regulation as reliably as using a strong post-excision promoter like CAG.\n\nOption D: Pcp2-driven standard Cre crossed to ROSA26::CAG-LSL-mSyn. This lacks tamoxifen-inducible control; recombination will occur during development whenever Pcp2 is active, failing the adult-onset requirement.\n\nOption E: ROSA26::Pcp2-LSL-mSyn with tamoxifen treatment. Without any Cre recombinase present, tamoxifen cannot induce expression. This fails to meet the inducibility requirement.\n\nConclusion: Option A uniquely and optimally meets all requirements: Purkinje-cell specificity via Pcp2-Cre-ERt2, adult-onset induction with tamoxifen, robust expression via CAG after LSL excision, and precise insertion at ROSA26 using CRISPR-Cas9.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2332861"}]}
