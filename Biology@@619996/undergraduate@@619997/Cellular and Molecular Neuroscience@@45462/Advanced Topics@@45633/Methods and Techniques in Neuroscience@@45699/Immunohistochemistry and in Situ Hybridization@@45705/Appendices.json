For RNA, Watson-Crick base pairing rules are: $A$ pairs with $U$ and $G$ pairs with $C$. Because hybridization is antiparallel, the antisense RNA that binds runs $3' \\to 5'$ opposite the target’s $5' \\to 3'$.\n\nStep-by-step base pairing from the target $5'$ end to the $3'$ end gives the complementary antisense strand in the $3' \\to 5'$ orientation:\n- $G \\to C$\n- $C \\to G$\n- $A \\to U$\n- $U \\to A$\n- $U \\to A$\n- $G \\to C$\n- $A \\to U$\n- $A \\to U$\n- $C \\to G$\n\nThus, aligned antiparallel to the target, the antisense sequence is $3'$-CGU-AAC-UUG-$5'$.

A primary antibody first targets the protein of interest, and then a labeled secondary antibody detects the primary antibody, amplifying the signal. This exercise [@problem_id:2338967] simulates a common experimental pitfall, forcing you to troubleshoot a failed experiment by critically evaluating the species compatibility between the primary and secondary antibodies—a concept we call the \"chain of specificity.\"", "problem": "A neuroscientist is conducting an experiment to visualize the localization of a novel, synapse-associated protein called \"NeuroFelin-1\" within the hippocampus of a mouse brain. The experimental technique being used is indirect Immunohistochemistry (IHC). The protocol involves using a primary antibody that specifically binds to NeuroFelin-1. This primary antibody was produced by immunizing a rabbit with the purified NeuroFelin-1 protein. After incubation with the primary antibody, the tissue slice is treated with a secondary antibody. The researcher mistakenly uses a commercially available secondary antibody labeled \"goat anti-mouse Immunoglobulin G (IgG),\" which is conjugated to a green fluorescent protein. Despite the primary antibody having high affinity for NeuroFelin-1, the researcher observes no specific fluorescent signal in the hippocampus.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct explanation for the failure of this experiment?\n\nA. The secondary antibody is designed to bind specifically to the constant region of antibodies produced in mice, not those produced in rabbits.\n\nB. The \"goat anti-mouse IgG\" secondary antibody will bind to the endogenous mouse IgG naturally present in the brain tissue, preventing it from binding to the primary antibody.\n\nC. The primary antibody, having been raised in a rabbit, cannot effectively bind to the NeuroFelin-1 protein which is expressed in a mouse, due to inter-species incompatibility.\n\nD. The goat-derived secondary antibody and the rabbit-derived primary antibody are immunologically incompatible, causing them to precipitate out of the solution before they can bind to the tissue.\n\nE. The green fluorescent protein on the secondary antibody is quenched by components of the mouse brain tissue, preventing signal detection.", "solution": "In indirect immunohistochemistry, the detection strategy requires two sequential bindings:\n1) A primary antibody raised in a given host species binds the target antigen in the tissue via its antigen-binding (Fab) region.\n2) A secondary antibody, raised in another species and generated to recognize the constant (Fc) region of the primary antibody’s IgG, binds specifically to the host species of the primary antibody.\n\nTherefore, the necessary matching rule is: the secondary antibody must be anti-(host species of primary) IgG. Concretely, for a primary antibody “rabbit anti–NeuroFelin-1,” the correct secondary must be “anti-rabbit IgG,” not anti-mouse IgG.\n\nIn the described experiment, the primary antibody is produced in rabbit (rabbit anti–NeuroFelin-1). The secondary used is “goat anti-mouse IgG.” By design, “goat anti-mouse IgG” recognizes epitopes on the Fc (constant) region of mouse IgG, not rabbit IgG. Because the rabbit primary antibody’s Fc region lacks the mouse-specific epitopes, the secondary cannot bind the primary. Without secondary binding, no fluorescent label is recruited to the primary antibody bound to NeuroFelin-1, producing no specific fluorescent signal.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states the species-specific Fc recognition mismatch: the secondary is specific for mouse IgG Fc, not rabbit IgG Fc. This directly explains the absence of signal.\n- B suggests binding to endogenous mouse IgG in tissue. Even if some endogenous IgG exists, this does not explain the failure to detect the primary; the dominant issue is that the secondary cannot bind the rabbit primary at all.\n- C is incorrect: rabbit antibodies commonly bind mouse proteins in IHC if raised against the mouse antigen; there is no intrinsic inter-species incompatibility preventing antigen recognition.\n- D is incorrect: there is no general “goat–rabbit” incompatibility causing precipitation under standard IHC conditions; moreover, the secondary would need to recognize rabbit IgG to form immune complexes, which it does not.\n- E is unlikely and not the most direct explanation. Fluorophore quenching would not selectively eliminate signal only from the primary; the primary issue here is the species mismatch between primary and secondary.\n\nThus, the most accurate and direct explanation is the species-mismatch of the secondary antibody with the primary antibody’s Fc region.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2338967"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying if a molecule is present, modern neuroscience often asks where it is in relation to other molecules. To investigate functional units like synapses, we must determine if presynaptic and postsynaptic markers are spatially colocalized. This practice [@problem_id:2338915] moves from qualitative imaging to quantitative analysis, guiding you through the calculation of the Manders' Overlap Coefficient. This metric allows you to transform fluorescent signals from an image into a meaningful number that represents the degree of spatial overlap between two proteins.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating synaptic connectivity in a mouse model of a neurodevelopmental disorder. The researcher performs dual-label immunofluorescence on a brain slice to visualize presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic densities. The presynaptic protein, Synapsin I, is labeled with a red fluorophore, and the postsynaptic protein, Homer1, is labeled with a green fluorophore. The analysis is focused on a small, three-dimensional region of interest (ROI) that encompasses several putative synapses.\n\nAfter image acquisition and background subtraction, the researcher uses an intensity threshold to identify pixels containing significant fluorescent signal for each protein. The analysis yields the following integrated intensity values, measured in arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU):\n\n- The total integrated intensity of all red pixels (Synapsin I) within the ROI is $I_{red\\_total} = 1.345 \\times 10^{5}$ AFU.\n- The total integrated intensity of all green pixels (Homer1) within the ROI is $I_{green\\_total} = 1.621 \\times 10^{5}$ AFU.\n- The integrated intensity of red pixels that are also positive for the green signal (i.e., pixels where both Synapsin I and Homer1 are present above threshold) is $I_{red\\_overlap} = 9.872 \\times 10^{4}$ AFU.\n- The integrated intensity of green pixels that are also positive for the red signal is $I_{green\\_overlap} = 1.155 \\times 10^{5}$ AFU.\n\nTo quantify the degree of colocalization, the researcher uses the Manders' Overlap Coefficient (MOC). The MOC consists of two coefficients, $M_{red}$ and $M_{green}$. The coefficient $M_{red}$ is defined as the fraction of the total red signal that colocalizes with the green signal. Similarly, $M_{green}$ is the fraction of the total green signal that colocalizes with the red signal.\n\nCalculate the value of $M_{red}$, which in this context represents the fraction of the total presynaptic marker signal that is spatially associated with the postsynaptic marker.
