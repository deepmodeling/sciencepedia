By distinguishing between key features like the presence of polyribosomes and the nature of synaptic specializations, you will solidify your understanding of the morphological signatures that define different parts of a neuron.", "problem": "An automated segmentation algorithm is being used to reconstruct neural circuits from a large-scale dataset acquired through Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) of the mammalian neocortex. The algorithm has produced a \"false merger,\" incorrectly connecting two distinct neuronal processes, labeled Segment A and Segment B, into a single object. A neuroscientist is tasked with manually inspecting the image stack at the point of the erroneous merger to determine the identity of each segment so the connection can be severed. The goal is to identify which segment is the axon and which is the dendrite.\n\nThe ultrastructural morphological features observed within the two segments are as follows:\n\n**Segment A:**\n*   Numerous small, dense granular structures, consistent with polyribosomes, are frequently observed in the cytoplasm.\n*   The microtubules within the process are loosely organized with variable spacing between them.\n*   The membrane of this segment is seen to form synapses where it exhibits a prominent thickening known as a postsynaptic density.\n*   Mitochondria are present throughout the segment.\n\n**Segment B:**\n*   Polyribosomes are conspicuously absent from the cytoplasm.\n*   The microtubules are arranged in tight, parallel bundles with uniform spacing.\n*   At several locations, the segment's membrane is apposed to postsynaptic densities on other neuronal profiles, and its cytoplasm contains dense clusters of small, uniform, clear-cored synaptic vesicles.\n*   Mitochondria are present, though they appear generally smaller and more spherical than in Segment A.\n\nBased on this information, identify Segment A and Segment B and select the option that provides the correct identification and the most definitive piece of supporting evidence.\n\nA. Segment A is the axon and Segment B is the dendrite, because axons contain more mitochondria to fuel action potential propagation.\n\nB. Segment A is the dendrite and Segment B is the axon, because microtubule bundles are always more tightly packed in dendrites.\n\nC. Segment A is the axon and Segment B is the dendrite, because dendrites are defined by the presence of synaptic vesicles for receiving signals.\n\nD. Segment A is the dendrite and Segment B is the axon, because the presence of polyribosomes in Segment A indicates local protein synthesis machinery, a hallmark of dendrites.\n\nE. It is impossible to distinguish the two segments, as both contain microtubules and mitochondria, which are common to all neuronal processes.", "solution": "We must distinguish dendrite versus axon based on ultrastructural features in FIB-SEM.\n\nFirst, evaluate the presence or absence of polyribosomes. Segment A contains numerous polyribosomes, which are a hallmark of dendrites (and dendritic spines) supporting local protein synthesis; axons typically lack polyribosome rosettes. This observation alone strongly indicates that Segment A is a dendrite. Segment B conspicuously lacks polyribosomes, consistent with axonal identity.\n\nSecond, assess synaptic specializations. Segment A’s membrane exhibits a prominent postsynaptic density at synapses, which identifies it as postsynaptic, a key feature of dendrites at excitatory (asymmetric) synapses. Segment B’s membrane is apposed to postsynaptic densities on other profiles and its cytoplasm contains dense clusters of small, clear-cored synaptic vesicles—this combination defines a presynaptic terminal, i.e., an axon bouton forming synapses onto postsynaptic targets.\n\nThird, consider microtubule organization. Segment A shows loosely organized microtubules with variable spacing, characteristic of dendrites. Segment B shows tight, parallel bundles with uniform spacing, characteristic of axons.\n\nFourth, mitochondria are present in both segments and thus are not definitive; however, the observation that Segment B mitochondria are smaller and more spherical is consistent with many axonal boutons, whereas larger, more elongated mitochondria are more common in dendrites. This supports but does not determine the identification.\n\nIntegrating these features, Segment A is the dendrite and Segment B is the axon. Among the choices, the most definitive single piece of supporting evidence is the presence of polyribosomes in Segment A, marking dendritic local translation machinery. Therefore, the correct option is D: Segment A is the dendrite and Segment B is the axon, because the presence of polyribosomes in Segment A indicates local protein synthesis machinery, a hallmark of dendrites.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2332049"}, {"introduction": "Modern connectomics is as much a data science challenge as it is a biological one, beginning with the sheer volume of data generated by electron microscopes.

They have fully reconstructed a segment of a pyramidal neuron's apical dendrite. The analysis is performed on a stack of images representing a total physical thickness (z-height) of $T_{stack}$. To determine the synaptic input, an annotator meticulously identifies and counts all excitatory synapses targeting the dendritic segment. However, to ensure accuracy in morphological measurements, the analysis protocol dictates that only synapses whose entire volume (including the presynaptic bouton and the postsynaptic density) is fully contained within the top and bottom boundaries of the image stack are included in the primary count.
