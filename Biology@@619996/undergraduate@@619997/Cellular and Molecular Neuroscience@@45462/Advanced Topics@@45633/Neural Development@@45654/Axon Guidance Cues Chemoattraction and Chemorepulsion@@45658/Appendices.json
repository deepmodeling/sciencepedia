{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin, let's explore one of the most fundamental experimental methods for identifying guidance cues: the stripe assay. This powerful in vitro technique presents a developing axon with a choice between two different surfaces, allowing us to directly observe its preferences. By analyzing how a growth cone navigates this patterned environment, we can infer the function of unknown molecules, as demonstrated in this first practice problem [@problem_id:2327811].", "problem": "In an in vitro experiment to study axon pathfinding, a researcher prepares a culture substrate. The substrate is coated with alternating, parallel stripes. The first set of stripes (Stripe A) is coated exclusively with laminin, a protein known to be a permissive substrate for axonal growth. The second set of stripes (Stripe B) is coated with a mixture of laminin and a purified, uncharacterized molecule designated 'Factor Y'.\n\nNeuronal explants from the developing spinal cord are placed on this patterned substrate and allowed to grow for 48 hours. Upon subsequent microscopic examination, it is observed that axons extend readily from the explants and elongate along the laminin-only stripes (Stripe A). When an axon's growth cone encounters a boundary with a stripe containing Factor Y (Stripe B), it consistently retracts and turns away, continuing its growth along Stripe A. Consequently, the regions corresponding to Stripe B are almost entirely devoid of axons.\n\nBased on this experimental observation, which of the following best describes the primary function of Factor Y for these axons?\n\nA. Chemoattractant\n\nB. Cell adhesion molecule\n\nC. Neurotrophic factor\n\nD. Chemorepellent", "solution": "The substrate contains alternating parallel stripes: Stripe A with laminin only (a permissive substrate for axon elongation) and Stripe B with laminin plus an unknown Factor Y. The observation is that axons elongate along laminin-only stripes and, upon encountering the boundary with Stripe B, the growth cones retract and turn away, leaving Stripe B devoid of axons.\n\nLogical evaluation of each option:\n- If Factor Y were a chemoattractant (A), growth cones would be biased toward Stripe B, crossing into it or aligning with it. The observed behavior is the opposite (avoidance), so A is inconsistent.\n- If Factor Y were a cell adhesion molecule (B), it would increase adhesivity and typically facilitate or at least permit growth on Stripe B. The near absence of axons on Stripe B argues against enhanced adhesion and instead indicates avoidance; thus B is inconsistent.\n- If Factor Y were a neurotrophic factor (C), it would support neuronal survival and often promote neurite extension. Its presence would be expected to increase, not decrease, growth on Stripe B. The observed retraction and turning away contradicts this, so C is inconsistent.\n- If Factor Y were a repulsive guidance cue (D), contact with or sensing of Factor Y would cause growth cone collapse, retraction, and turning, resulting in axon exclusion from Stripe B. This precisely matches the observation. Although the term “chemorepellent” often implies a diffusible cue, stripe assays commonly detect substrate-bound repulsive guidance signals as well; among the provided options, D best captures the functional interpretation.\n\nTherefore, Factor Y acts primarily as a repulsive guidance cue for these axons.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2327811"}, {"introduction": "Having established how to identify a repellent, we now turn to a more subtle but critical aspect of attraction: the role of the concentration gradient. Chemoattraction is not merely a response to the presence of a cue, but a directed movement up its gradient. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2327829] challenges our intuition by asking what happens when a growth cone is bathed in a uniform field of an attractant, thereby removing all directional information and revealing the true basis of chemotactic guidance.", "problem": "A team of neurobiologists is investigating a newly identified protein, Axonin-7, for its role in guiding developing hippocampal neurons. In preliminary experiments, they established that when Axonin-7 is released from a point source, creating a stable concentration gradient, it acts as a potent chemoattractant, causing neuronal growth cones to turn and grow towards the source.\n\nFor their next experiment, the team prepares a special culture dish. The entire volume of the growth medium within the dish is infused with a high, but perfectly uniform, concentration of Axonin-7. A healthy, isolated hippocampal neuron with an actively extending axon and growth cone is then introduced into the center of this dish.\n\nAssuming Axonin-7 has no other biological effects besides chemoattraction, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the behavior of the axon's growth cone in this environment over the next several hours?\n\nA. The growth cone will grow exceptionally fast in a straight line, but in a randomly chosen direction, due to the high isotropic stimulation.\n\nB. The growth cone will retract completely, as the lack of a gradient is interpreted as a negative or confusing signal.\n\nC. The growth cone's filopodia will actively explore the surroundings, but there will be no net directional advancement of the axon, leading to a stalled or meandering-in-place state.\n\nD. The growth cone will be guided towards the nearest wall of the culture dish, where the concentration is lowest due to boundary effects.\n\nE. The growth cone will initiate a pre-programmed circular growth pattern to systematically scan the environment for a gradient.", "solution": "We are told Axonin-7 functions solely as a chemoattractant: it biases growth cone advance up a concentration gradient. The fundamental principle of chemotaxis is that directional bias depends on the spatial gradient of the chemoattractant, not the absolute concentration. In continuum terms, the drift component of motion is proportional to the gradient, e.g., $\\vec{v}_{\\text{bias}} \\propto \\nabla c$, where $c$ is the attractant concentration field. With a perfectly uniform concentration throughout the dish, we have $\\nabla c = \\vec{0}$ everywhere, so no directional bias can arise from chemoattraction.\n\nGrowth cones generate motility via actin-driven filopodial and lamellipodial dynamics and can advance, retract, and turn in response to local receptor-mediated signaling. In a uniform field, receptor occupancy is uniform across the growth cone, so there is no left-right or front-back difference to steer the growth cone. Under the stated assumption that Axonin-7 has no other biological effects besides chemoattraction, there is no reason to expect retraction or collapse triggered by high uniform concentration; rather, motility will continue without a directional bias. Consequently, the trajectory becomes an unbiased exploratory process (akin to a random walk): while local protrusions and retractions continue, the expected net displacement over time is zero, i.e., $\\langle \\Delta \\vec{x} \\rangle = \\vec{0}$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because high isotropic stimulation without a gradient does not produce a directional bias; chemoattraction requires $\\nabla c \\neq \\vec{0}$.\n- B is incorrect because uniform concentration is not specified to be repulsive or toxic, and the assumption forbids other effects.\n- C correctly states that filopodia will explore but there will be no net directional advance, leading to a stalled or meandering-in-place state.\n- D is incorrect because the setup specifies a perfectly uniform concentration in the entire volume; there is no boundary gradient to the wall.\n- E is incorrect; there is no mechanism for a pre-programmed circular path solely to find a gradient under the given assumption.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2327829"}, {"introduction": "Finally, let's synthesize our understanding of attraction and repulsion by examining a classic scenario in neural development: the crossing of the spinal cord midline. This process is a beautiful example of molecular choreography, where axons are first attracted to the midline and then repelled to prevent them from lingering or re-crossing. This exercise [@problem_id:2327764] uses a hypothetical genetic knockout to probe the system, highlighting how the precise interplay between opposing cues is essential for establishing correct neural circuitry.", "problem": "In the developing vertebrate spinal cord, a class of neurons known as commissural neurons sends axons from the dorsal region towards the ventral midline. This initial pathfinding is directed by a concentration gradient of a diffusible chemoattractant, \"Guidance Factor Alpha\" (GFA), which is secreted by cells at the ventral midline. Upon reaching the midline, these axons must cross to the opposite side and are then prevented from crossing back. This is achieved by a second molecule, \"Midline Repellent Factor\" (MRF), which is also secreted by midline cells. A key feature of this system is that commissural axons only begin to express functional receptors for MRF as they approach the midline, making them sensitive to its repulsive effects only after they have been successfully attracted there.\n\nImagine a genetically engineered mouse model where the gene encoding for the Midline Repellent Factor (MRF) has been knocked out, meaning no MRF protein is produced. All other components of the guidance system, including GFA and all necessary receptors, are expressed normally.\n\nBased on this scenario, which of the following describes the most likely navigational error that will be observed for the commissural axons in these MRF-knockout mice?\n\nA. The axons will fail to grow towards the ventral midline and instead will project randomly within the dorsal spinal cord.\n\nB. The axons will successfully grow to the midline but will then either stall there or wander back and forth across it.\n\nC. The axons will be repelled from their own cell bodies and will fail to extend from the dorsal spinal cord.\n\nD. The axons will cross the midline and then be excessively repelled, projecting much farther away from the midline on the contralateral side than they would in a normal mouse.\n\nE. The axons will ignore both attractive and repulsive cues, growing in a perfectly straight line from their origin, regardless of the midline's position.", "solution": "Identify the guidance cues and their roles:\n- Guidance Factor Alpha (GFA) is a diffusible chemoattractant from the ventral midline that directs dorsal commissural axons ventrally. Therefore, in the presence of normal GFA, initial growth toward the midline remains intact.\n- Midline Repellent Factor (MRF) is a repellent secreted by midline cells. Commissural axons only express functional MRF receptors as they approach the midline, so MRF acts to prevent lingering at and recrossing of the midline after arrival and crossing.\n\nApply the knockout condition:\n- In the MRF knockout, there is no repellent cue at the midline, but GFA and all receptors (including the inducible MRF receptors) are normal. Thus, attraction to the midline via GFA persists, but midline repulsion is absent.\n\nPredict the behavioral consequence:\n- Axons will still be attracted to and reach the midline (due to intact GFA signaling).\n- Without MRF, they will lack the repulsive signal needed to exit the midline region and to prevent recrossing. This typically results in stalling at the midline, failure to move away on the contralateral side, or repeated crossing/back-and-forth wandering at the midline.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A is incorrect because GFA is intact; attraction to the midline will occur.\n- B is correct: axons reach the midline but stall or wander back and forth without MRF.\n- C is incorrect; there is no self-repulsion from the soma implied by the system.\n- D is incorrect; excessive repulsion would require increased MRF, not its absence.\n- E is incorrect; axons do not ignore cues since GFA is present and effective.\n\nTherefore, the most likely navigational error is described by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2327764"}]}
