This exercise provides a quantitative framework to explore this principle by modeling how synapse density relates to the concentration of a crucial synapse-promoting protein. By engaging with this problem, you will calculate how genetically inducing protein overexpression can reshape the physical connectivity of a neuron, solidifying the link between molecular-level changes and circuit architecture [@problem_id:2352016].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating synaptogenesis on a pyramidal neuron's primary dendrite. For modeling purposes, the dendritic segment of interest is approximated as a perfect cylinder with a length $L$ and a radius $r$. The formation of excitatory synapses on this dendrite is critically dependent on a transmembrane protein, which we'll call \"Synapsin-X\". Experimental data suggests a direct proportionality between the density of synapses (number of synapses per unit area) and the surface concentration of Synapsin-X (number of protein molecules per unit area).\n\nInitially, the dendritic segment has a uniform Synapsin-X surface concentration of $C_0$. The proportionality constant relating synaptic density, $\\sigma$, to the Synapsin-X concentration, $C$, is given by $k$, such that $\\sigma = kC$. The neuroscientist then employs a viral vector to genetically modify the neuron, causing it to overexpress Synapsin-X. This modification leads to a specific, uniform increase in the surface concentration of Synapsin-X by a factor of $\\alpha$ over the entire segment, meaning the new concentration is $C_f = \\alpha C_0$. Assume that the dimensions of the dendrite do not change and that the system reaches a new equilibrium.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- Dendrite length, $L = 250 \\text{ \\mu m}$\n- Dendrite radius, $r = 1.2 \\text{ \\mu m}$\n- Initial Synapsin-X concentration, $C_0 = 60.0 \\text{ molecules/\\mu m}^2$\n- Proportionality constant, $k = 0.050 \\text{ synapses/molecule}$\n- Concentration increase factor, $\\alpha = 2.25$\n\nCalculate the total number of *new* synapses that are formed on this segment of the dendrite.

It is an excellent hands-on example of how a simple set of local rules can generate highly specific neural connectivity.", "problem": "In a developing region of the mammalian neocortex, two distinct neuronal populations, Population A (presynaptic) and Population B (postsynaptic), are forming connections. Population A consists of $N_A = 3000$ neurons, and Population B consists of $N_B = 400$ neurons.\n\nThe formation of synapses is governed by the molecular interaction between Neurexin (Nrxn) on presynaptic terminals and Neuroligin (Nlgn) on postsynaptic densities. Specifically, all neurons in Population A express Neurexin-1$\\beta$ (Nrxn1$\\beta$), but they are divided into two genetically distinct subpopulations based on a key alternative splicing event at splice site 4 (SS4). A fraction $f_{A+} = 0.75$ of Population A neurons expresses the splice variant Nrxn1$\\beta$(SS4+), while the remaining neurons express Nrxn1$\\beta$(SS4-). All neurons in Population B express Neuroligin-1 (Nlgn1).\n\nBiochemical studies have established that the Nrxn1$\\beta$(SS4-) variant binds to Nlgn1 with high affinity, leading to the formation of 'high-stability' potential synapses. In contrast, the Nrxn1$\\beta$(SS4+) variant binds to Nlgn1 with significantly lower affinity, forming 'low-stability' potential synapses.\n\nInitially, exuberant connections are made, where every neuron from Population A forms a potential synapse with every neuron in Population B. Following this, a process of competitive synapse elimination occurs. This refinement is governed by a postsynaptic capacity limit: each neuron in Population B can only maintain a maximum of $K = 900$ stable synapses from Population A. The stabilization process is strictly competitive based on stability. For each postsynaptic neuron, high-stability potential synapses are always selected for maintenance over low-stability ones. If the number of available high-stability inputs is less than $K$, all are maintained, and the remaining slots are filled by randomly selecting from the available low-stability inputs.\n\nAssuming this process goes to completion, calculate the total number of stable synapses that are ultimately formed by the subpopulation of neurons expressing Nrxn1$\\beta$(SS4+).
