Using molecular techniques, the researcher determines that these neurons express a high density of Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors on their surface but completely lack the expression of Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) receptors.\n\nTo test the functional consequences of this receptor profile, the researcher prepares two separate, identical cell cultures of these neurons in a basal medium that lacks any growth factors.\n- To Culture A, the researcher adds Nerve Growth Factor (NGF).\n- To Culture B, the researcher adds Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).\n\nAssuming that cell survival in this context is entirely dependent on the activation of either TrkA or TrkB signaling pathways, predict the most likely outcome for the neurons in each culture after a sufficient incubation period.\n\nA.

Neurotrophin receptor specificity dictates that NGF is the cognate ligand for TrkA, while BDNF is the cognate ligand for TrkB, which can be represented as $\\text{NGF} \\Rightarrow \\text{TrkA activation}$ and $\\text{BDNF} \\Rightarrow \\text{TrkB activation}$.\n\nBy the problem’s assumption, neuronal survival in this setup depends entirely on activation of either TrkA or TrkB.

Because $\\text{TrkA} = 0$, NGF cannot activate any Trk receptor, so $\\text{TrkA active} = 0$. There is no BDNF present, so $\\text{TrkB active} = 0$. Therefore, $S=0$ for Culture A, implying the neurons will not survive.\n\nFor Culture B, BDNF is added and TrkB is expressed at high density. Thus BDNF binds and activates TrkB, giving $\\text{TrkB active} = 1$. By the stated dependency, this is sufficient for survival, so $S=1$ for Culture B, implying the neurons will survive.\n\nTherefore, neurons in Culture B will survive, while neurons in Culture A will not, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2353366"}, {"introduction": "Once a neurotrophin binds its cognate receptor, the signal is relayed inside the cell through complex intracellular signaling pathways. While several pathways are activated, they are not redundant; specific pathways are critically responsible for distinct cellular outcomes, such as survival, growth, or differentiation. This exercise ([@problem_id:2353352]) allows you to explore the consequence of selectively blocking one of these key pathways, highlighting the essential role of the PI3K-Akt cascade in mediating neurotrophin-dependent survival.", "problem": "A developmental neurobiologist is investigating the signaling mechanisms underlying neuronal survival. The researcher prepares a primary culture of embryonic cortical neurons in a serum-free medium, which lacks endogenous growth factors. Under these conditions, the neurons are known to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) within 24 hours unless an external survival factor is provided.\n\nThe researcher's experiment focuses on the effects of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a key protein that promotes neuronal survival. It is known that BDNF exerts its effects by binding to its specific receptor, Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). This binding triggers the activation of three major independent downstream intracellular signaling pathways:\n1. The Ras-Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (Ras-MAPK) pathway.\n2. The Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) - Protein Kinase B (Akt) pathway.\n3. The Phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) pathway.\n\nThe experiment consists of treating the neuronal culture with a new, highly specific pharmacological inhibitor that completely and selectively blocks the enzymatic activity of PI3K. Immediately following the application of the inhibitor, a standard concentration of BDNF is added to the culture medium.\n\nBased on the established roles of these signaling pathways in cellular and molecular neuroscience, which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed in the neurons treated with both the PI3K inhibitor and BDNF?\n\nA. The neurons will undergo widespread apoptosis, similar to neurons receiving no BDNF treatment at all.\n\nB. The neurons will survive and appear healthy, as the Ras-MAPK pathway can fully compensate for the blocked PI3K-Akt pathway to promote survival.\n\nC. The neurons will fail to differentiate and extend neurites, but their overall survival rate will be normal.\n\nD. The treatment will have no significant effect on survival compared to neurons treated with BDNF alone, as the inhibitor does not prevent BDNF from binding to its TrkB receptor.", "solution": "Under serum-free conditions, embryonic cortical neurons undergo apoptosis unless a survival signal activates intracellular anti-apoptotic mechanisms. BDNF binding to TrkB initiates three major pathways: Ras-MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and PLC-gamma. Among these, the PI3K-Akt pathway is the principal mediator of trophic-factor-dependent survival. Mechanistically, TrkB-PI3K signaling generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, recruits and activates Akt, and Akt then phosphorylates multiple substrates to suppress apoptosis (for example, inactivation of Bad, inhibition of caspase-9, promotion of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family function, and engagement of CREB and mTOR-dependent survival programs). \n\nA complete and selective block of PI3K prevents Akt activation despite intact TrkB binding by BDNF. Without Akt signaling, the key anti-apoptotic arm of BDNF is abrogated. While Ras-MAPK can promote differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and certain gene-expression programs, and PLC-gamma can modulate intracellular calcium and PKC activity, these pathways generally do not fully compensate for the loss of PI3K-Akt in supporting survival under trophic deprivation. Therefore, neurons treated with both the PI3K inhibitor and BDNF will fail to receive the critical survival signal and will undergo apoptosis at levels comparable to neurons without BDNF.\n\nEvaluating the choices:\n- A is consistent with the essential role of PI3K-Akt in survival.\n- B is incorrect because Ras-MAPK does not fully compensate for PI3K-Akt loss in survival.\n- C reflects consequences expected from blocking Ras-MAPK, not PI3K-Akt.\n- D is incorrect because receptor binding without downstream PI3K-Akt activation is insufficient for survival.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is widespread apoptosis similar to no BDNF treatment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2353352"}, {"introduction": "Neurotrophin signaling is further refined by mechanisms that can seem paradoxical at first glance, such as the synthesis of precursors (pro-neurotrophins) that have functions opposite to their mature forms. This elegant regulatory system depends on which receptor a neuron expresses—the high-affinity Trk receptors or the p75 neurotrophin receptor ($p75^{NTR}$), which can trigger cell death. The following thought experiment ([@problem_id:2353347]) delves into this advanced concept, asking you to predict the fate of different neuronal populations when only the pro-neurotrophin is available.", "problem": "In the developing peripheral nervous system, the survival of distinct neuronal populations is exquisitely regulated by target-derived neurotrophic factors. One such factor is Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), which is initially synthesized as a precursor protein, pro-NT-3. In the extracellular space, pro-NT-3 is typically cleaved by proteases into its mature, active form, NT-3.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume the following simplified signaling rules:\n1.  Mature NT-3 binds with high affinity to the Tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC), and this interaction robustly promotes cell survival.\n2.  The precursor, pro-NT-3, does not bind effectively to TrkC but binds with high affinity to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). This interaction, in the absence of significant Trk receptor signaling, actively promotes apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n\nConsider a genetically engineered mouse model in which the cleavage site on the pro-NT-3 molecule has been mutated, rendering it completely resistant to proteolytic processing. In this model, only pro-NT-3 is secreted, and no mature NT-3 is formed. During a critical developmental window, two specific neuronal populations rely on this neurotrophin source for survival signals.\n-   **Population 1:** Proprioceptive sensory neurons, which primarily express the TrkC receptor to ensure their survival.\n-   **Population 2:** A subset of cutaneous nociceptive (pain-sensing) neurons, which are characterized by high expression of the p75NTR receptor and negligible expression of any Trk receptors.\n\nBased on the provided signaling rules, predict the most likely consequence for the survival of these two neuronal populations in the genetically engineered mice compared to normal, wild-type mice.\n\nA. Increased survival of proprioceptive neurons and decreased survival of nociceptors.\n\nB. Decreased survival of proprioceptive neurons and increased survival of nociceptors.\n\nC. Decreased survival for both proprioceptive neurons and nociceptors.\n\nD. Increased survival for both proprioceptive neurons and nociceptors.\n\nE. No significant change in survival for either neuronal population.", "solution": "We begin by restating the signaling rules:\n- Mature NT-3 binds TrkC with high affinity and promotes survival.\n- Pro-NT-3 does not effectively bind TrkC but binds p75NTR with high affinity and, in the absence of significant Trk signaling, promotes apoptosis.\n\nIn the engineered mice, the cleavage site mutation prevents conversion of pro-NT-3 to mature NT-3. Therefore, only pro-NT-3 is present in the extracellular space; no mature NT-3 is available.\n\nApply these rules to each neuronal population:\n- Proprioceptive sensory neurons (Population 1) primarily express TrkC and rely on mature NT-3 for survival signaling. Because mature NT-3 is absent and pro-NT-3 does not activate TrkC, these neurons lose their essential survival signal. Any p75NTR engagement (if present) would bias further toward apoptosis in the absence of Trk signaling. Therefore, their survival decreases relative to wild-type.\n- The subset of cutaneous nociceptors (Population 2) has high p75NTR and negligible Trk expression. In the presence of only pro-NT-3, p75NTR is robustly activated without counterbalancing Trk signaling, which promotes apoptosis. Therefore, their survival also decreases relative to wild-type.\n\nThus, both populations exhibit decreased survival compared to normal mice, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2353347"}]}
