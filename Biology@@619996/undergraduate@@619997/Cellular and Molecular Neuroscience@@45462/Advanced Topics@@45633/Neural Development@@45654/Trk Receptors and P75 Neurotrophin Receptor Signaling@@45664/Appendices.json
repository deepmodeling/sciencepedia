{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The language of cells is one of remarkable specificity. For a signaling molecule, or ligand, to exert its effect, it must bind to a corresponding receptor on the cell surface, much like a key fitting into a lock. This fundamental principle of ligand-receptor specificity is perfectly illustrated by the neurotrophin family and their Tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) receptors. This first practice challenges you to apply this core concept to a hypothetical experiment, testing whether you can predict a neuron's fate based solely on the molecular pairing between the receptor it expresses and the neurotrophin it is exposed to [@problem_id:2354216].", "problem": "A developmental neurobiologist is investigating the survival requirements of a specific population of embryonic neurons in a cell culture experiment. Through genetic modification, these neurons are engineered to express only a single type of neurotrophin receptor on their cell surface: Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA). The standard culture medium lacks any neurotrophins. To test the signaling specificity, the researcher prepares a culture dish with these modified neurons and adds a high concentration of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) to the medium.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most likely fate for these neurons under these specific experimental conditions?\n\nA. The neurons will activate strong survival pathways, extend neurites, and differentiate.\n\nB. The neurons will rapidly proliferate, increasing the cell count in the dish.\n\nC. The neurons will internalize the BDNF-TrkA complexes, leading to a down-regulation of all surface receptors.\n\nD. The survival rate of the neurons will not be significantly different from that of control neurons cultured in a medium completely lacking any neurotrophins.\n\nE. The BDNF will act as an antagonist to the TrkA receptor, actively inducing programmed cell death.", "solution": "The solution to this problem lies in understanding the specific binding relationships between neurotrophins (the ligands) and their high-affinity receptors, the Tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) family.\n\nStep 1: Identify the components of the signaling system in the problem.\nThe neurons are engineered to express only one type of receptor: TrkA.\nThe signaling molecule added to the culture is Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).\n\nStep 2: Recall the canonical binding specificity of Trk receptors.\nNeurotrophin signaling is highly specific. Different neurotrophins preferentially bind to and activate different Trk receptors to initiate downstream signaling cascades, which typically promote cell survival, growth, and differentiation. The primary pairings are:\n- Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) binds with high affinity to TrkA.\n- Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) binds with high affinity to TrkB.\n- Neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) also binds with high affinity to TrkB.\n- Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) binds with high affinity to TrkC. (NT-3 can also bind to TrkA and TrkB, but with lower affinity).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the specific interaction in the problem scenario.\nThe neurons express TrkA receptors, but the ligand provided is BDNF. Based on the specificity rules from Step 2, BDNF does not bind with high affinity to the TrkA receptor. Its primary target is the TrkB receptor, which is absent in these engineered cells.\n\nStep 4: Predict the cellular outcome based on the lack of binding.\nSince BDNF cannot effectively bind to and activate the TrkA receptors present on the neurons, the intracellular survival signaling pathways associated with Trk receptor activation will not be initiated. The presence of BDNF in the medium is therefore irrelevant to these specific cells. The state of these neurons is functionally equivalent to being in a culture medium that contains no appropriate survival factors.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\nA. The neurons will activate strong survival pathways, extend neurites, and differentiate. This is incorrect. This outcome would be expected if the correct ligand, NGF, were added.\nB. The neurons will rapidly proliferate, increasing the cell count in the dish. This is incorrect. Neurons are post-mitotic cells and do not typically proliferate, especially in response to neurotrophins which primarily promote survival and differentiation.\nC. The neurons will internalize the BDNF-TrkA complexes, leading to a down-regulation of all surface receptors. This is incorrect. Significant receptor-ligand internalization occurs only after high-affinity binding, which does not happen between BDNF and TrkA.\nD. The survival rate of the neurons will not be significantly different from that of control neurons cultured in a medium completely lacking any neurotrophins. This is correct. Because BDNF does not activate the TrkA receptors, adding it to the medium has no effect. The neurons will lack survival signals, just as they would in a control dish with no neurotrophins at all. In both cases, they would likely undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) due to the absence of required survival factors.\nE. The BDNF will act as an antagonist to the TrkA receptor, actively inducing programmed cell death. This is incorrect. BDNF is not an antagonist for TrkA; it simply fails to bind with any significant affinity. It does not actively trigger a death-inducing signal through TrkA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2354216"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple binding, the next step is to understand the mechanism of receptor activation. For receptor tyrosine kinases like the $Trk$ family, the binding of a ligand is simply the trigger for the critical event: receptor dimerization, where two receptor molecules come together. This practice explores what happens if we could artificially induce this dimerization using a synthetic compound, completely bypassing the natural ligand [@problem_id:2354242]. This thought experiment will deepen your understanding of how receptor signaling is initiated at a molecular level.", "problem": "In a cell biology laboratory, a researcher is studying a primary culture of embryonic sensory neurons. These neurons are known to depend on Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) for their survival and differentiation. The primary receptor for NGF is the Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA). When these sensory neurons are cultured in a basal medium completely lacking NGF and other growth factors, they undergo widespread programmed cell death (apoptosis).\n\nA new pharmacological agent, \"Compound M-21,\" has been developed. It is a small-molecule, cell-permeable drug designed to specifically interact with the intracellular domain of the TrkA receptor. Biochemical assays confirm that Compound M-21 effectively induces the dimerization of TrkA receptors, even in the complete absence of the extracellular ligand, NGF. The drug has no affinity for other receptors, including the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), which is also expressed on these neurons.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where the embryonic sensory neurons are plated in the basal medium lacking NGF. The culture is then treated with a sufficient concentration of Compound M-21. Based on the known mechanism of neurotrophin receptor signaling, what is the most likely outcome for the neuronal culture after 24 hours of treatment with Compound M-21?\n\nA. The neurons will undergo widespread and rapid apoptosis, identical to the control culture without any additions.\n\nB. The neurons will exhibit enhanced survival and begin to extend neurites (axonal and dendritic processes).\n\nC. The culture will show no significant change compared to the control, as the natural ligand NGF is absent.\n\nD. The neurons will undergo apoptosis because the activation of TrkA in the absence of NGF causes a conflicting signal with the p75NTR.\n\nE. The neurons will lose their neuronal characteristics and de-differentiate into progenitor-like cells.", "solution": "Embryonic sensory neurons expressing TrkA require NGF-mediated TrkA activation for survival and differentiation; in the absence of NGF, these neurons undergo apoptosis due to lack of trophic signaling. The canonical mechanism for receptor tyrosine kinase activation (applicable to TrkA) is ligand-induced receptor dimerization, which permits trans-autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the intracellular kinase domains. These phosphotyrosines serve as docking sites for SH2- and PTB-domain adaptor proteins that initiate downstream pro-survival and differentiation signaling cascades. In the NGF-TrkA system, NGF binding to the extracellular domain of TrkA induces receptor dimerization and activation of three principal pathways: (i) PI3K-Akt signaling, which promotes survival by inhibiting pro-apoptotic factors and enhancing pro-survival gene expression; (ii) Ras-MAPK signaling, which promotes differentiation and neurite outgrowth; and (iii) PLC-$\\gamma$ signaling, which modulates intracellular calcium and PKC, contributing to neurite dynamics and gene expression changes supportive of differentiation.\n\nCompound M-21 is stated to be a small-molecule, cell-permeable agent that specifically binds the intracellular domain of TrkA and effectively induces TrkA dimerization in the absence of NGF, with no activity on other receptors, including p75NTR. For receptor tyrosine kinases, dimerization of the intracellular kinase domains is both necessary and sufficient to trigger trans-autophosphorylation, provided the kinase domains are catalytically competent. Therefore, effective dimerization by Compound M-21 is expected to mimic the ligand-bound state and trigger autophosphorylation of TrkA, recruiting Shc/Grb2/SOS, PI3K, and PLC-$\\gamma$, and thereby activating the PI3K-Akt, Ras-MAPK, and PLC-$\\gamma$ pathways.\n\nOnce these pathways are activated, the expected cellular outcomes mirror those of NGF stimulation: PI3K-Akt signaling suppresses apoptosis and supports cell survival; Ras-MAPK signaling drives differentiation programs and neurite extension; PLC-$\\gamma$ signaling contributes to cytoskeletal remodeling and additional differentiation signals. Because Compound M-21 does not engage p75NTR and the culture lacks neurotrophins, there is no pro-apoptotic signaling via p75NTR (which generally requires pro-neurotrophin ligands). Moreover, active TrkA signaling typically counteracts any weak basal apoptotic tendencies through Akt-mediated survival.\n\nTherefore, in NGF-free medium supplemented with a sufficient concentration of Compound M-21, the neurons will not follow the apoptotic trajectory seen in the untreated control. Instead, they will exhibit enhanced survival and initiate neurite outgrowth consistent with TrkA activation. This outcome excludes: option A (apoptosis identical to control), because TrkA signaling is activated; option C (no change), because ligand-independent activation of TrkA drives strong downstream signaling; option D (apoptosis due to conflict with p75NTR), because p75NTR is not engaged and TrkA activation is pro-survival; and option E (de-differentiation), which is not a known consequence of TrkA activation and is contradicted by the expected differentiation signaling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2354242"}, {"introduction": "Cellular signaling is rarely a one-receptor, one-ligand affair. More often, a cell's fate is decided by integrating multiple, sometimes conflicting, signals. This final practice introduces the $p75$ neurotrophin receptor ($p75^{\\text{NTR}}$), which can bind the same neurotrophins as $Trk$ receptors but can initiate starkly different downstream pathways, including apoptosis. You will analyze a scenario where a neuron expresses both a non-functional $Trk$ receptor and a functional $p75^{\\text{NTR}}$, forcing you to weigh the balance of opposing signals to determine the ultimate cellular outcome [@problem_id:2354252].", "problem": "In neuronal signaling, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a critical protein that typically promotes the survival, growth, and differentiation of neurons. Its primary high-affinity receptor is the Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), a receptor tyrosine kinase. Upon binding BDNF, TrkB receptors dimerize and activate their intracellular kinase domains, leading to autophosphorylation and the initiation of pro-survival signaling cascades. Neurons also express the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), which can also bind BDNF. The signaling outcome of p75NTR is context-dependent: in the absence of concurrent pro-survival signaling from Trk receptors, activation of p75NTR by a neurotrophin is known to initiate signaling pathways that lead to programmed cell death (apoptosis).\n\nConsider a population of cultured neurons that has been genetically engineered. In these modified neurons, all expressed TrkB receptors are a mutant form that lacks the entire intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. This mutant receptor can still be expressed on the cell surface and bind to BDNF with normal affinity, but it is incapable of autophosphorylation or activating any downstream pathways. These neurons continue to express normal, wild-type p75NTR.\n\nIf these engineered neurons are subjected to a continuous and saturating concentration of BDNF, what is the most likely long-term outcome for the majority of these cells?\n\nA. The neurons will exhibit enhanced survival and neurite outgrowth compared to untreated controls.\n\nB. The neurons will enter a state of quiescence, with no significant change in survival or apoptosis rates.\n\nC. The neurons will undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) at a higher rate than untreated controls.\n\nD. The neurons will revert to a progenitor-like state due to conflicting signaling inputs.\n\nE. The neurons will show normal survival rates, as the p75NTR receptor will compensate for the lack of TrkB signaling.", "solution": "We proceed by explicit, causal reasoning about receptor-ligand interactions and downstream signaling logic.\n\n1. Define relevant receptors and canonical signaling outcomes:\n- TrkB is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, upon BDNF binding and receptor dimerization, activates its intracellular kinase domain, leading to autophosphorylation. This initiates pro-survival and pro-growth pathways, including PI3K-Akt, MAPK-ERK, and PLC-$\\gamma$-mediated signaling. The net cellular outcome under sustained activation is enhanced survival and neurite outgrowth.\n- p75NTR binds neurotrophins and can signal in a context-dependent manner. In the absence of concurrent Trk signaling, p75NTR activation biases toward pro-apoptotic pathways, including activation of JNK and c-Jun, and engagement of cell death programs.\n\n2. Specify the engineered condition:\n- All TrkB receptors are mutant, lacking the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. They bind BDNF with normal affinity but cannot autophosphorylate or signal downstream. Therefore, even at saturating BDNF, there is no TrkB-dependent pro-survival signaling. Because these mutants still bind BDNF, they can sequester ligand without producing survival signals.\n- p75NTR remains wild-type and is capable of being activated by BDNF.\n\n3. Predict signaling under continuous, saturating BDNF:\n- BDNF engagement occurs at both mutant TrkB (non-signaling) and p75NTR (signaling). The TrkB arm of signaling is functionally null: no autophosphorylation, no PI3K-Akt, no MAPK-ERK, no PLC-$\\gamma$ outputs.\n- With no Trk-driven pro-survival signals to counterbalance p75NTR outputs, p75NTR activation is expected to drive pro-apoptotic pathways. The problem statement explicitly stipulates that in the absence of pro-survival Trk signaling, p75NTR activation by a neurotrophin initiates apoptosis signaling.\n\n4. Infer long-term population outcome:\n- Sustained, saturating BDNF maintains p75NTR activation without any accompanying TrkB survival signaling, thereby chronically engaging apoptotic pathways. Over time, this increases the rate of programmed cell death relative to untreated controls.\n\n5. Exclude alternative options:\n- Option A is incompatible because enhanced survival and outgrowth require functional TrkB signaling, which is absent.\n- Option B is unlikely because p75NTR activation without Trk survival input is pro-apoptotic rather than neutral.\n- Option D is not supported; neurotrophin receptor signaling does not drive reversion to a progenitor-like state under these conditions.\n- Option E is incorrect because p75NTR does not compensate for TrkB; in this context it promotes apoptosis rather than survival.\n\nTherefore, the most likely long-term outcome for the majority of these cells is increased apoptosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2354252"}]}
