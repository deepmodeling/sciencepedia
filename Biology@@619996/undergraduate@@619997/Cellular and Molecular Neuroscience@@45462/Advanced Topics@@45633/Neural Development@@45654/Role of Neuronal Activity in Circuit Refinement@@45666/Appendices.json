One of the core events in LTP induction is the activity-dependent insertion of AMPA-type glutamate receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. This practice provides a quantitative model to explore this process, allowing you to calculate the net change in synaptic strength by accounting for both the calcium-triggered insertion of new receptors and their ongoing, constitutive removal [@problem_id:2349991].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating a simplified model of synaptic plasticity at a single dendritic spine on a CA1 pyramidal neuron. The postsynaptic membrane of this spine initially contains $N_0 = 50$ functional AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). To induce an excitatory synapse strengthening phenomenon known as Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a high-frequency electrical stimulation is delivered to the presynaptic axon.\n\nThis stimulation causes a significant influx of calcium ions (Ca$^{2+}$) into the dendritic spine through NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). The resulting transient increase in intracellular calcium concentration triggers a signaling cascade that promotes the insertion of new AMPARs into the postsynaptic membrane from an intracellular reserve pool. In this model, the total number of newly inserted AMPARs, $N_{\\text{insert}}$, is directly proportional to the total molar quantity of calcium ions, $Q_{\\text{Ca}}$, that enters the spine. The proportionality constant is $\\alpha = 2.50 \\times 10^{14}$ receptors per mole of Ca$^{2+}$. The experiment is designed such that the total calcium influx into the spine is measured to be $Q_{\\text{Ca}} = 0.32$ picomoles.\n\nConcurrently with this insertion process, there is a constitutive, activity-independent process of receptor endocytosis (internalization) that removes AMPARs from the membrane. During the observation period following the stimulation, a total of $N_{\\text{remove}} = 18$ receptors are removed from the functional pool at the synapse.\n\nCalculate the final total number of functional AMPARs on this dendritic spine after these activity-dependent insertion and constitutive removal processes have occurred.

While some forms of plasticity alter the postsynaptic cell, others, like the one explored here, modify the presynaptic terminal.

The postsynaptic response to the contents of a single vesicle, known as the quantal size, is measured to be $q = 0.30$ mV. The synapse then undergoes a long-term depression (LTD) protocol, consisting of prolonged low-frequency stimulation. This protocol is known to induce a purely presynaptic form of plasticity at this specific synapse, reducing the average vesicle release probability to $p_{\\text{final}} = 0.18$ without altering the number of readily releasable vesicles ($N$) or the quantal size ($q$).\n\nCalculate the fractional change in the average amplitude of the Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) following the LTD induction.

The initial strength of the synapse is $S_0 = 120.0$ a.u.\n\nThe researcher's model describes how synaptic strength changes in response to two specific stimulation protocols:\n\n1.  **Weak Potentiation Protocol**: This stimulus induces a weak form of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). When applied to a synapse with strength $S_{i}$, it results in a new strength $S_{f} = S_{i}(1+P)$, where $P=0.20$ is the potentiation factor.\n\n2.  **Depression Protocol**: This stimulus normally induces Long-Term Depression (LTD). When applied to a synapse with strength $S_{i}$, it results in a new strength $S_{f} = S_{i}(1-D)$, where $D=0.30$ is the standard depression factor.\n\nHowever, the model incorporates a principle of metaplasticity: the prior history of activity at the synapse alters its subsequent response. Specifically, if the Depression Protocol is applied immediately after a Weak Potentiation Protocol, the effective depression factor is modified. The new, effective depression factor, $D'$, is given by the relation $D' = D \\exp(-k P)$, where $k=2.5$ is a dimensionless metaplastic coupling constant.\n\nThe researcher first applies the Weak Potentiation Protocol to the synapse at its initial state $S_0$.
