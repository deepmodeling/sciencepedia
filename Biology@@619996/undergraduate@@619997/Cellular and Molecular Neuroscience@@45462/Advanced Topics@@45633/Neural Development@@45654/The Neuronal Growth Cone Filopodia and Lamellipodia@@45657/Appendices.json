The growth cone extends finger-like protrusions called filopodia and veil-like sheets called lamellipodia, both of which are driven by the rapid polymerization of actin filaments. The researcher applies a newly synthesized drug that has a very specific mechanism: it binds to globular actin (G-actin) monomers in a way that completely prevents the binding of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). Assuming the drug rapidly equilibrates within the cell, what is the most direct and immediate consequence for the assembly of new actin filaments in both filopodia and lamellipodia?\n\nA. Existing actin filaments will be rapidly severed into shorter fragments.\n\nB. The assembly of new actin filaments at their plus (barbed) ends will be inhibited.\n\nC. The rate of actin filament treadmilling will significantly increase.\n\nD. Existing actin filaments will undergo rapid depolymerization from both the plus and minus ends simultaneously.\n\nE. Actin filaments will become excessively cross-linked, forming a rigid, static network.", "solution": "Actin-driven protrusion in filopodia and lamellipodia is powered by the addition of globular actin monomers to the plus (barbed) ends of filaments. In cells, the monomeric pool that efficiently incorporates at barbed ends is ATP-bound G-actin, which is supplied by nucleotide exchange on ADP-G-actin (often catalyzed by profilin). After incorporation, ATP is hydrolyzed, but the key requirement for assembly is that incoming monomers be ATP-bound.\n\nLet $[A_{\\mathrm{ATP}}]$ denote the concentration of ATP-bound G-actin monomers available for assembly, and let $k_{on}^{+}$ and $k_{off}^{+}$ be the on- and off-rate constants at the barbed end. The net growth velocity at the barbed end can be written as:\n$$\nv_{+} = k_{on}^{+}\\,[A_{\\mathrm{ATP}}] - k_{off}^{+}.\n$$\nThe drug described binds to G-actin in a way that completely prevents ATP binding. Under rapid equilibration, this drives $[A_{\\mathrm{ATP}}] \\to 0$, eliminating the polymerization term $k_{on}^{+}\\,[A_{\\mathrm{ATP}}]$.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence for assembly is inhibition of addition of new subunits at the barbed ends. While this can lead to reduced treadmilling and possibly net shortening over time (since $v_{+} \\approx -k_{off}^{+}$), the immediate effect specifically on assembly is the inhibition of new filament growth at plus ends.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A: Severing is not a direct consequence of blocking ATP binding to monomers.\n- B: Correct; assembly at plus ends requires ATP-G-actin and is inhibited.\n- C: Incorrect; treadmilling would decrease when assembly is inhibited.\n- D: Not the most direct effect; simultaneous rapid depolymerization from both ends is not implied.\n- E: Cross-linking is unrelated to nucleotide binding on monomers.\n\nThus, the correct choice is inhibition of assembly at barbed ends.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2353254"}, {"introduction": "While ATP provides the universal fuel for actin polymerization, the growth cone employs distinct molecular machinery to organize filaments into vastly different architectures. The broad, sheet-like lamellipodium and the slender, finger-like filopodium are not built by identical mechanisms. This practice [@problem_id:2353267] presents a comparative thought experiment, challenging you to deduce the specific roles of the Arp2/3 complex and formin proteins by predicting the morphological outcomes of their respective knockouts, thereby linking specific molecular pathways to distinct cellular structures.", "problem": "A neurobiologist is investigating the molecular mechanisms that govern the morphology of the neuronal growth cone, the motile tip of a developing axon. The growth cone's ability to navigate is dependent on two primary actin-based structures: broad, sheet-like protrusions called lamellipodia, which generate propulsive force, and thin, finger-like sensory protrusions called filopodia.\n\nTo dissect the roles of key actin-regulating proteins, the researcher develops two distinct lines of cultured neurons with targeted genetic knockouts:\n\n- **Line A:** These neurons have a conditional knockout of the Actin-Related Protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, a key initiator of actin filament branching.\n- **Line B:** These neurons have a conditional knockout of the Diaphanous-related formin mDia, a protein known to nucleate and promote the elongation of unbranched actin filaments.\n\nThe researcher then compares the growth cone morphology of neurons from Line A and Line B to that of unaltered, wild-type neurons, which exhibit a classic morphology with a prominent central lamellipodium surrounded by numerous filopodia.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the observed growth cone phenotypes in the two knockout lines?\n\nA. Line A: Growth cones lack lamellipodia and consist primarily of filopodia. Line B: Growth cones lack filopodia, appearing as broad, flattened lamellipodia.\n\nB. Line A: Growth cones lack filopodia, appearing as broad, flattened lamellipodia. Line B: Growth cones lack lamellipodia and consist primarily of filopodia.\n\nC. Neurons from both Line A and Line B fail to form any growth cone protrusions, resulting in a rounded, non-motile axon tip.\n\nD. Neurons from both Line A and Line B exhibit growth cone morphology indistinguishable from wild-type, suggesting functional redundancy between the two pathways.", "solution": "The morphology of growth cone protrusions reflects the underlying actin assembly mechanisms. Lamellipodia are driven by dense branched actin networks nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex, which generates Y-branched filaments that create a broad, sheet-like protrusive force at the leading edge. Filopodia, in contrast, are composed of bundled, unbranched, parallel actin filaments whose nucleation and elongation are promoted by formins such as mDia, often in cooperation with proteins like Ena/VASP; these structures act as sensory antennae.\n\nIn Line A, the Arp2/3 complex is knocked out. Without Arp2/3, the canonical mechanism for generating a branched dendritic actin network is absent, which specifically compromises lamellipodia formation. However, unbranched filament assembly mediated by formins and associated bundling factors can still occur, so filopodia can persist or even be accentuated relative to the diminished lamellipodium. Therefore, growth cones are predicted to lack lamellipodia and consist primarily of filopodia.\n\nIn Line B, the formin mDia is knocked out. Loss of mDia impairs nucleation and processive elongation of unbranched actin filaments that form the core of filopodia, thereby reducing or eliminating filopodia. The Arp2/3 pathway remains intact, so branched network assembly continues to support broad, flattened lamellipodia. Therefore, growth cones are predicted to lack filopodia and appear as broad lamellipodial veils.\n\nThese predictions match choice A and are inconsistent with the alternatives: reversing the phenotypes is incorrect, eliminating all protrusions is not expected because each pathway can still function when the other is removed, and complete redundancy is contradicted by the distinct structural specializations of Arp2/3 and formins.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2353267"}, {"introduction": "The structures within a growth cone are not static; their shape is the result of a dynamic equilibrium between actin filament assembly and disassembly. A key aspect of understanding growth cone function is quantifying the rate of this \"treadmilling\" process in different regions. This problem [@problem_id:2353306] introduces you to a powerful experimental technique, Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), by asking you to analyze hypothetical data to calculate and compare the actin turnover rates in a lamellipodium versus a filopodium, thus connecting cellular dynamics to quantitative analysis.", "problem": "In a study of neuronal pathfinding, a researcher investigates the cytoskeletal dynamics within a growth cone, the highly motile structure at the tip of a developing axon. Specifically, they want to compare the rate of actin filament turnover in two distinct sub-regions: the highly dynamic, sheet-like lamellipodium and a more stable, finger-like filopodium. To do this, they perform a Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiment. In this technique, actin monomers are fluorescently tagged, a small region of interest is photobleached (its fluorescence is destroyed by a high-intensity laser), and the recovery of fluorescence in that region is monitored over time as new, unbleached fluorescent actin monomers diffuse in and incorporate into filaments.\n\nThe recovery of the normalized fluorescence intensity, $F(t)$, in the bleached spot is well-described by the following model, assuming a fully mobile fraction of actin:\n$$F(t) = 1 - (1 - F_0) \\exp(-kt)$$\nwhere $F_0$ is the normalized fluorescence intensity at time $t=0$ (immediately after bleaching), and $k$ is the recovery rate constant. This rate constant, $k$, is directly proportional to the overall actin turnover rate in the structure.\n\nThe researcher conducts two separate FRAP experiments:\n1.  **Lamellipodium:** A region within the lamellipodium is bleached. The initial post-bleach normalized intensity is measured to be $F_{0,lam} = 0.20$. After a time interval of $t_1 = 12.0 \\text{ s}$, the intensity recovers to $F_{lam}(t_1) = 0.85$.\n2.  **Filopodium:** A region within a stable filopodium is bleached to the same initial level, so $F_{0,filo} = 0.20$. After the same time interval of $t_1 = 12.0 \\text{ s}$, the intensity in this region recovers to only $F_{filo}(t_1) = 0.45$.\n\nBased on these experimental data, calculate the ratio of the actin turnover rate in the lamellipodium to that in the filopodium. Express your answer as a single numerical value, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal is to find the ratio of the actin turnover rates, which is equivalent to the ratio of the recovery rate constants, $k_{lam} / k_{filo}$.
