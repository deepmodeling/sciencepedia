By considering the consequences of removing the Slit receptor, Robo1, you will apply the core principles of midline axon guidance to predict a pathfinding phenotype. This practice solidifies your understanding of how repulsion is essential for ensuring axons correctly exit the midline after crossing [@problem_id:2340972].", "problem": "In the developing vertebrate spinal cord, commissural neurons extend axons that cross the ventral midline to connect the two sides of the nervous system. This process is orchestrated by a precise sequence of molecular guidance cues and their receptors. The floor plate, located at the midline, secretes two key signaling molecules: Netrin-1, a chemoattractant, and Slit, a chemorepellent. Commissural axons initially express the receptor DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma), which binds to Netrin-1 and directs axon growth towards the midline. Upon reaching and crossing the midline, the axons dramatically upregulate the expression of the Robo1 (Roundabout 1) receptor, which binds to the Slit protein.\n\nConsider a genetic experiment in which the gene for the Robo1 receptor is knocked out, rendering it non-functional. Based on the established roles of these molecules, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the trajectory of commissural axons after they reach the midline?\n\nA. The axons will be prematurely repelled by the midline and will fail to cross it, turning away before reaching the floor plate.\n\nB. The axons will cross the midline but will then stall, wander aimlessly near the midline, or re-cross it multiple times, failing to project away from it.\n\nC. The axons will fail to grow towards the midline from the outset, instead projecting randomly or away from the floor plate.\n\nD. The axons will cross the midline and project away from it in a manner indistinguishable from normal, wild-type axons.\n\nE. The axons will grow towards the midline and then stop abruptly, unable to enter or cross the floor plate region.", "solution": "We interpret the problem using established axon guidance principles in the developing vertebrate spinal cord.\n\n1) Guidance cues and receptors pre-crossing:\n- The floor plate secretes Netrin-1 (chemoattractant) and Slit (chemorepellent).\n- Pre-crossing commissural axons express DCC, which binds Netrin-1 and attracts axons toward the midline.\n- To avoid premature repulsion by Slit, pre-crossing axons keep Robo1 levels low.\n\n2) Guidance cues and receptors post-crossing:\n- After crossing the midline, commissural axons upregulate Robo1.\n- Robo1 binding to Slit switches the axons to Slit sensitivity, which repels them from the midline, ensuring exit from the floor plate and preventing recrossing.\n\n3) Predicted effect of Robo1 knockout:\n- Knocking out Robo1 removes Slit responsiveness. The Netrin-1 attraction via DCC remains intact, so axons still grow toward and cross the midline.\n- Without Robo1-mediated Slit repulsion after crossing, axons fail to be repelled from the midline. The expected phenotype is stalling near the midline, wandering, or repeated midline recrossing, rather than proper projection away.\n\n4) Elimination of incorrect options:\n- A is incorrect: premature repulsion requires Robo1; without it, axons are not repelled before crossing.\n- C is incorrect: approach to the midline is mediated by DCC-Netrin-1 and is unaffected by Robo1 loss.\n- D is incorrect: the absence of Robo1 disrupts the post-crossing repulsion needed for normal exit and prevents proper projection away.\n- E is incorrect: inability to enter or cross would require excessive repulsion; Robo1 loss reduces repulsion, not increases it.\n\n5) Conclusion:\n- The correct outcome is that axons cross but fail to project away, instead stalling or repeatedly crossing the midline.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2340972"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic model of midline repulsion, this problem explores a more nuanced layer of regulation: how do axons temporarily ignore the \"stop sign\" that Slit presents? This scenario, involving a specific mutation in the regulatory protein Robo3, challenges you to think about the molecular logic that creates a \"permissive window\" for midline crossing. Solving this requires understanding how dynamic changes in protein isoforms can dictate an axon's response to its environment [@problem_id:2340959].", "problem": "In the developing vertebrate Central Nervous System (CNS), commissural axons originating in the dorsal spinal cord must navigate a complex environment to cross the ventral midline, a structure known as the floor plate. This process is tightly regulated by a balance of attractive and repulsive guidance cues. The floor plate secretes both the attractant Netrin-1 and the repellent Slit. Commissural axons express the receptor DCC, which mediates attraction towards Netrin-1, and the receptor Robo1, which mediates repulsion from Slit.\n\nTo successfully cross the midline, pre-crossing axons must be temporarily insensitive to the Slit repellent. This is achieved through the expression of the Robo3 protein, which exists in two key splice isoforms with distinct functions: Robo3.1 and Robo3.2.\n- **Robo3.1**: Expressed on pre-crossing axons. It binds to the Robo1 receptor intracellularly, preventing its transport to the cell surface. This effectively silences Slit-Robo1 signaling, rendering the axon \"blind\" to the Slit repellent and allowing it to cross the midline guided by Netrin-1.\n- **Robo3.2**: Expression is upregulated on post-crossing axons as Robo3.1 is downregulated. It does not inhibit Slit-Robo1 signaling. Instead, it sensitizes the axon to Slit, ensuring that once an axon has crossed, it is strongly repelled by the midline and cannot re-cross.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered mouse model in which a targeted mutation disrupts the splicing mechanism of the *Robo3* gene. This mutation completely abolishes the production of the Robo3.1 isoform and forces the exclusive expression of the Robo3.2 isoform on all commissural axons, both before and after they reach the midline.\n\nBased on the functions of these proteins, predict the most likely pathfinding phenotype for commissural axons in this mutant mouse.\n\nA. The commissural axons will cross the midline correctly but will then fail to turn rostrally, instead continuing to grow straight or re-crossing the midline multiple times.\n\nB. The commissural axons will fail to extend ventrally from the dorsal spinal cord, stalling near their origin and never reaching the vicinity of the floor plate.\n\nC. The commissural axons will extend towards the floor plate but will be repelled at the entrance to the midline, failing to cross and often turning prematurely along the ipsilateral side.\n\nD. The commissural axons will show no significant guidance defects, crossing the midline and projecting normally on the contralateral side.\n\nE. The commissural axons will successfully cross the midline but will then stall immediately on the contralateral side, failing to migrate further.", "solution": "Logical framework:\n- Guidance cues and receptors: The floor plate emits an attractant, Netrin-1, sensed via DCC, and a repellent, Slit, sensed via Robo1. For pre-crossing commissural axons to reach and traverse the midline, Slit-Robo1 repulsion must be silenced until crossing is complete.\n- Isoform-specific roles of Robo3: Robo3.1, expressed pre-crossing, binds Robo1 intracellularly and prevents its surface localization, thereby silencing Slit-Robo1 signaling and permitting Netrin-1/DCC-mediated attraction to dominate. After crossing, Robo3.1 is downregulated and Robo3.2 is upregulated; Robo3.2 does not inhibit Slit-Robo1 signaling and instead promotes Slit sensitivity so axons are repelled from the midline and do not re-cross.\n\nMutation scenario:\n- Only Robo3.2 is expressed at all stages. Consequently, pre-crossing axons lack Robo3.1-mediated inhibition of Robo1. Robo1 can reach the surface and mediate Slit responsiveness. Because Robo3.2 does not block (and even promotes) Slit responsiveness, pre-crossing axons will be sensitive or hypersensitive to Slit.\n\nPredicted behavior from cue integration:\n- Netrin-1/DCC attraction still draws axons ventrally toward the floor plate.\n- However, Slit/Robo1 repulsion remains active at the approach to the midline. Without Robo3.1-mediated silencing, Slit repulsion will dominate at the midline interface, causing axons to fail to enter and traverse the floor plate.\n- Typical observed outcome under midline hypersensitivity to Slit is approach to the floor plate followed by premature turning along the ipsilateral longitudinal axis rather than crossing.\n\nMapping to choices:\n- This matches the description: extend toward the floor plate but be repelled at the entrance, failing to cross and often turning prematurely along the ipsilateral side.\n\nTherefore, the most likely phenotype is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2340959"}, {"introduction": "This exercise shifts our focus to the quantitative aspects of bifunctional guidance cues like Netrin-1. Using a simplified mathematical model, you will determine the precise concentration at which Netrin-1's attractive effect, mediated by the DCC receptor, is perfectly balanced by its repulsive effect, which requires the co-receptor Unc5. This practice develops your ability to translate biological principles into mathematical expressions and solve for critical parameters that govern cell behavior [@problem_id:2341004].", "problem": "In the developing nervous system, the guidance of axons to their correct targets is orchestrated by extracellular guidance cues. Netrin-1 is a classic example of such a cue, capable of eliciting either an attractive or repulsive response from a navigating growth cone, depending on the complement of receptors expressed on its surface.\n\nConsider a simplified model for the turning response, $\\theta$, of a neuronal growth cone to a local gradient of Netrin-1. The turning angle is defined such that $\\theta > 0$ represents attraction towards the Netrin-1 source, and $\\theta < 0$ represents repulsion.\n\nThe attractive response is mediated by the DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma) receptor. Its contribution to the turning angle, $\\theta_A$, is dependent on the Netrin-1 concentration, $[N]$, according to the following relation:\n$$ \\theta_A([N]) = \\frac{A_m [N]}{K_A + [N]} $$\nHere, $A_m$ is the maximum attractive turning angle and $K_A$ is the effective dissociation constant for the attractive response.\n\nThe repulsive response is activated when Netrin-1 binds to a complex of DCC and the Unc-5 homolog (Unc5) receptor.
