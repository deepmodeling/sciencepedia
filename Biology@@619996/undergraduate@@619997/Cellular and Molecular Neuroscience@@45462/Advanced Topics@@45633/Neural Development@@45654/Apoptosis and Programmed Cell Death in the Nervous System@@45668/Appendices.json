The researcher prepares three distinct populations of these neurons:\n\n*   **Population X:** Wild-type (WT) neurons with a normal genetic background.\n*   **Population Y:** Genetically engineered neurons that constitutively overexpress B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), a key anti-apoptotic protein.\n*   **Population Z:** Genetically engineered neurons that are null for both Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). Bak and Bax are essential pro-apoptotic effector proteins required for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization.\n\nAll three populations are initially cultured in a medium rich with NGF.

All three populations will experience near-total cell death, showing no significant difference in survival rates.\n\nE. The percentage of surviving cells will be lowest in Population X, while Populations Y and Z will have equally high survival rates.", "solution": "We apply the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway logic that governs trophic factor–dependent neurons such as dorsal root ganglion neurons. NGF withdrawal removes survival signaling (notably PI3K–Akt and MAPK), thereby upregulating and/or activating BH3-only proteins (for example, Bim, Puma). These BH3-only proteins neutralize anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and directly or indirectly activate Bax and Bak. Activated Bax and Bak oligomerize in the mitochondrial outer membrane to produce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), leading to cytochrome c release, apoptosome formation, caspase-9 activation, executioner caspase activation, and apoptosis. MOMP in this pathway strictly requires Bax and Bak.\n\nEvaluate each population under NGF withdrawal:\n\n1) Population X (WT): NGF withdrawal permits BH3-only activation, which activates Bax/Bak to induce MOMP, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation, resulting in apoptosis. Thus, survival is expected to be low.\n\n2) Population Y (Bcl-2 overexpression): Bcl-2 is anti-apoptotic. Overexpressed Bcl-2 sequesters BH3-only proteins and/or prevents Bax/Bak activation and oligomerization, thereby inhibiting MOMP and downstream caspase activation. Survival is therefore increased relative to WT. However, overexpression of Bcl-2 typically does not produce an absolute block under strong apoptotic stimuli; some cells may still die through residual or alternative routes. Hence survival is higher than WT but not maximal.\n\n3) Population Z (Bak/Bax double null): Bax and Bak are the essential effectors for MOMP in the intrinsic pathway. In their absence, MOMP cannot occur even if BH3-only proteins are fully activated by NGF withdrawal. Consequently, cytochrome c release and apoptosome formation are blocked, and caspase activation via the intrinsic pathway is prevented. Thus, survival is expected to be highest in this group over the 48-hour observation period.\n\nComparative prediction: Population Z shows the highest survival, Population Y shows intermediate survival (greater than WT due to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2), and Population X shows the lowest survival.

This problem focuses on caspase-3, a principal executioner, and its direct role in creating the characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis, such as cell shrinkage and nuclear fragmentation. By predicting the outcome in a neuron lacking this key enzyme, you will connect a specific molecular function to the physical transformation of a dying cell, a crucial skill in interpreting experimental results [@problem_id:2327058].", "problem": "In an experiment studying neuronal survival, a researcher cultures primary Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons, which are dependent on Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) for their survival and maintenance. One group of these neurons is genetically engineered to have a complete functional deletion of the gene encoding caspase-3, an enzyme known to be a critical \"executioner\" protease in the process of apoptosis. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a highly regulated process characterized by a distinct set of morphological changes, including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and the formation of membrane-bound apoptotic bodies.\n\nTo initiate apoptosis, the researcher removes NGF from the culture medium of both the normal (wild-type) DRG neurons and the caspase-3 deficient DRG neurons. After several hours, the morphological characteristics of the cells are observed using microscopy.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions most accurately predicts the morphological state of the caspase-3 deficient neurons after this period of NGF withdrawal?\n\nA. The neuron rapidly swells, its organelles break down, and the plasma membrane ruptures, releasing cytoplasmic contents into the medium.\n\nB. The neuron's soma remains largely intact, the nucleus does not fragment, and membrane blebbing is absent, although some mitochondrial dysfunction may be present.\n\nC. The neuron undergoes rapid nuclear condensation, fragmentation of its DNA and nucleus (karyorrhexis), and breaks down into multiple small, membrane-enclosed apoptotic bodies.\n\nD. The neuron displays a massive increase in the formation of cytoplasmic autophagosomes and vacuoles, leading to the digestion of its own organelles while maintaining plasma membrane integrity.\n\nE. The neuron shows no change and enters a state of enhanced growth, characterized by the sprouting of new neurites and an increase in soma size.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the morphological outcome in a neuron deficient in caspase-3 after an apoptotic stimulus is applied. To solve this, we must understand the sequence of events in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and the specific role of caspase-3.\n\nStep 1: Understand the apoptotic stimulus.\nThe survival of these Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons is dependent on Nerve Growth Factor (NGF). Withdrawing NGF from the culture medium removes this essential pro-survival signal. This acts as a potent stimulus for initiating the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.\n\nStep 2: Trace the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.\nThe intrinsic pathway is initiated by cellular stress, such as the withdrawal of growth factors. This leads to changes at the mitochondrial level. Pro-apoptotic proteins (like Bax and Bak) cause the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm.\n\nStep 3: Understand the caspase cascade.\nIn the cytoplasm, released cytochrome c binds to a protein called Apoptotic Protease Activating Factor-1 (Apaf-1). This complex then recruits an initiator caspase, procaspase-9, forming a structure called the apoptosome. Within the apoptosome, procaspase-9 molecules cleave and activate each other.\n\nStep 4: Identify the specific role of caspase-3.\nActivated caspase-9 is an \"initiator\" caspase. Its primary role is to activate the \"executioner\" caspases. The most important of these executioner caspases is caspase-3. Once activated by caspase-9, caspase-3 carries out the demolition of the cell by cleaving a wide array of critical cellular proteins.\n\nStep 5: Relate caspase-3 function to morphological changes.\nThe characteristic morphological features of apoptosis are a direct result of the substrates cleaved by executioner caspases like caspase-3:\n- Cleavage of nuclear lamins leads to the collapse of the nuclear envelope, resulting in chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis).\n- Cleavage of cytoskeletal proteins (e.g., actin, spectrin) leads to the loss of cell shape, cell shrinkage, and the formation of plasma membrane blebs.\n- Cleavage of the inhibitor of a DNase (specifically, ICAD, the inhibitor of Caspase-Activated DNase) unleashes the DNase to fragment the genomic DNA.\n- These events culminate in the cell breaking apart into small, membrane-enclosed apoptotic bodies, which are then cleared by phagocytic cells.\n\nStep 6: Analyze the effect of caspase-3 deletion.\nIn the given scenario, the gene for caspase-3 is deleted. Therefore, the caspase-3 protein is absent. When NGF is withdrawn, the apoptotic pathway will proceed up to the point of caspase-3 activation. Cytochrome c will be released, the apoptosome will form, and caspase-9 will be activated. However, because its primary target, procaspase-3, is missing, the cascade is blocked at this critical juncture. The \"executioner\" phase fails to occur.\n\nStep 7: Predict the resulting morphology and evaluate the options.\nSince caspase-3 is unavailable to cleave its substrates, the downstream morphological changes will be prevented. The nuclear lamins will not be cleaved, so the nucleus will not fragment. The cytoskeleton will not be dismantled, so the cell will not shrink significantly or form blebs. The cell will have received the death signal and may exhibit signs of cellular stress (like mitochondrial dysfunction due to cytochrome c release), but it will not be able to execute the final program. It will remain structurally whole.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n- A: Describes necrosis, a different, unregulated form of cell death characterized by swelling and lysis. This is incorrect.\n- B: Describes a cell that is stalled in the apoptotic process. The overall structure (soma, nucleus) remains intact, and the key execution-phase events (nuclear fragmentation, blebbing) are absent. This aligns perfectly with our reasoning. The mention of potential mitochondrial dysfunction is also consistent with the upstream events (cytochrome c release) that would still occur.\n- C: Describes a complete and successful apoptotic process. This would be the fate of the wild-type neurons, but not the caspase-3 deficient ones.\n- D: Describes large-scale autophagy. While there is cross-talk between apoptosis and autophagy, the primary consequence of blocking the main executioner caspase is not a switch to a full-blown autophagic phenotype, but rather an arrest of the apoptotic process itself.\n- E: Describes cell growth, which is the opposite of the expected response to growth factor withdrawal.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the neuron will fail to undergo the final stages of apoptosis, remaining morphologically intact despite the initiation of the death signaling cascade.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2327058"}, {"introduction": "Programmed cell death is an active, energy-intensive process that requires a significant investment of ATP.
