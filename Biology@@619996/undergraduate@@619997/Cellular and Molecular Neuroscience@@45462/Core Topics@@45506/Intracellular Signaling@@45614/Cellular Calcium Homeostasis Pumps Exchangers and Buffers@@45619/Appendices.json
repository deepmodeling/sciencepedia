Primary active transporters, such as the Plasma Membrane $Ca^{2+}$-ATPase (PMCA), act as the cell's dedicated workhorses, using ATP directly to pump ions.

Following a period of intense synaptic activity, there is a transient influx of $Ca^{2+}$ into the cell. To restore the resting state, the cell actively pumps these ions out using various mechanisms. One such mechanism is the Plasma Membrane $Ca^{2+}$-ATPase (PMCA) pump. This pump utilizes the energy from the hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to transport $Ca^{2+}$ against its steep concentration gradient.\n\nAssume a specific PMCA pump operates with a stoichiometry of one $Ca^{2+}$ ion extruded for every one molecule of ATP hydrolyzed.
