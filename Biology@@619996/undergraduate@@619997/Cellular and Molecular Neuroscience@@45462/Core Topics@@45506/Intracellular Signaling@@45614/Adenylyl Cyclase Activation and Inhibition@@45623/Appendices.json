These neurons express a G-protein coupled receptor that, when activated by its endogenous agonist, couples to a stimulatory G-protein ($G_s$). The activation of Gs leads to the stimulation of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nIn an experiment, a culture of these neurons is first pre-treated for a sufficient duration with a high concentration of a newly synthesized compound, which is known to be a competitive antagonist for the Gs-coupled receptor. Following this pre-treatment, the endogenous agonist is added to the culture medium at a concentration that would normally produce a robust increase in intracellular cAMP.\n\nAssuming the antagonist is effective and has no intrinsic activity of its own, what is the most likely immediate effect on the intracellular cAMP concentration in these pre-treated neurons upon addition of the agonist, compared to the baseline (resting) cAMP level before any compounds were added?\n\nA.

The cAMP level will increase massively, far exceeding the response seen with the agonist alone.", "solution": "The receptor in question is Gs-coupled, so agonist binding increases adenylyl cyclase activity and thereby increases intracellular cAMP. A competitive antagonist binds the same orthosteric site as the agonist without intrinsic efficacy, preventing agonist binding in a reversible, surmountable manner. In classical receptor theory with a competitive antagonist, the fractional occupancy by agonist is\n$$\n\\theta_{A}=\\frac{[A]/K_{A}}{1+[A]/K_{A}+[I]/K_{I}},\n$$\nwhere $[A]$ is the agonist concentration, $[I]$ is the antagonist concentration, and $K_{A},K_{I}$ are the respective equilibrium dissociation constants.\n\nAssuming effect above basal is proportional to agonist-occupied receptors, the agonist-evoked component of the response is\n$$\nE_{\\text{agonist}}=E_{\\max}\\frac{[A]}{[A]+K_{A}\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right)}.\n$$\nThus, a competitive antagonist increases the apparent $K_{A}$ by the factor $\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right)$, shifting the concentration-response curve to the right without changing $E_{\\max}$.\n\nWith pre-treatment by a high concentration of antagonist that is effective, $\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}$ is large, so for a fixed agonist concentration $[A]$ that would normally produce a robust increase, the denominator $[A]+K_{A}\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right)$ is dominated by $K_{A}\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right)$ and\n$$\nE_{\\text{agonist}}\\approx E_{\\max}\\frac{[A]}{K_{A}\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right)}\\to 0\n$$\nas $[I]/K_{I}$ becomes large. Therefore, the agonist produces little to no additional cAMP over basal in the presence of sufficient competitive antagonist.\n\nBecause the antagonist has no intrinsic activity (i.e., it is not an inverse agonist), it does not alter basal receptor activity or basal cAMP when present alone. Consequently, upon addition of the agonist to antagonist-pre-treated neurons, the intracellular cAMP level remains approximately at the baseline (resting) level observed before any compounds were added.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immediate effect is no significant change from baseline, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2326452"}, {"introduction": "The activity of G-proteins is governed by a tightly regulated cycle of activation and inactivation, with GTP hydrolysis serving as the crucial 'off-switch'.

This practice will deepen your understanding of the G-protein cycle's mechanics and the powerful consequences of disrupting this intrinsic regulatory step. [@problem_id:2326429]", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating a signaling pathway in a population of cultured neurons. These neurons express a specific G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) known as Receptor S, which exclusively couples to the stimulatory G-protein, $G_s$. The alpha subunit of $G_s$ ($G_{s\\alpha}$), when activated, stimulates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which synthesizes cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) from ATP. The signaling pathway is terminated when the intrinsic GTPase activity of $G_{s\\alpha}$ hydrolyzes its bound Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP), rendering $G_{s\\alpha}$ inactive.\n\nThe experiment proceeds as follows:\nAt time $t=0$, a saturating concentration of a specific agonist for Receptor S is added to the culture medium. The system is allowed to reach a steady state. Then, at time $t=5$ minutes, a cell-permeable compound, guanosine 5'-[γ-thio]triphosphate (GTPγS), is added to the medium.

The cAMP concentration will begin to oscillate with a high frequency.\nE. The cAMP concentration will slowly and progressively decrease as the receptors become desensitized, despite the presence of GTPγS.", "solution": "1) Identify the signaling sequence and termination mechanism under agonist alone. Receptor S couples to $G_s$. Upon agonist binding, the receptor acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), promoting GDP release and GTP binding on $G_{s\\alpha}$. The active $G_{s\\alpha}\\text{-GTP}$ stimulates adenylyl cyclase, increasing the synthesis rate of cAMP from ATP. Termination occurs when the intrinsic GTPase activity of $G_{s\\alpha}$ hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, returning $G_{s\\alpha}$ to the inactive state. At steady state for $0<t<5$ minutes, the fraction of active $G_{s\\alpha}$, denoted $f$, is determined by the balance between receptor-driven activation and GTPase-driven inactivation.\n\n2) Represent the steady state before GTPγS addition. Let $f(t)$ denote the fraction of $G_{s\\alpha}$ in the active, GTP-bound form. A minimal balance model is\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dt}=k_{\\text{act}}(R^{*})(1-f)-k_{\\text{hyd}}\\,f,\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{act}}(R^{*})$ is the receptor-driven activation rate (increases with agonist-saturated receptor $R^{*}$) and $k_{\\text{hyd}}$ is the intrinsic GTPase-dependent inactivation rate. For $0<t<5$ minutes, the system reaches a steady state $f^{*}$ given by\n$$\n0=k_{\\text{act}}(R^{*})(1-f^{*})-k_{\\text{hyd}}\\,f^{*}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad f^{*}=\\frac{k_{\\text{act}}(R^{*})}{k_{\\text{act}}(R^{*})+k_{\\text{hyd}}}.\n$$\nAdenylyl cyclase activity $A$ increases monotonically with $f$, so $A$ is elevated but not maximal unless $f^{*}\\approx 1$. The cAMP concentration $[cAMP](t)$ evolves as\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}[cAMP]=v_{\\text{syn}}(A(f)) - k_{\\text{deg}}[cAMP],\n$$\nwith $v_{\\text{syn}}(A)$ increasing in $A$ and $k_{\\text{deg}}$ capturing phosphodiesterase-mediated degradation. The steady state for $0<t<5$ minutes is\n$$\n[cAMP]^{*}_{\\text{agonist}}=\\frac{v_{\\text{syn}}(A(f^{*}))}{k_{\\text{deg}}}.\n$$\n\n3) Introduce GTPγS at $t=5$ minutes and determine its kinetic consequence. GTPγS is a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog that binds $G_{s\\alpha}$ in place of GTP but is resistant to intrinsic GTPase hydrolysis. Once $G_{s\\alpha}$ binds GTPγS (catalyzed by the agonist-occupied receptor acting as a GEF), it becomes active and cannot return to the GDP-bound inactive state via hydrolysis. Thus, for the GTPγS-bound subpopulation, the effective inactivation term vanishes:\n$$\nk_{\\text{hyd}}\\to 0 \\quad \\text{for $G_{s\\alpha}\\text{-GTPγS}$}.\n$$\nBecause the agonist remains saturating at $t>5$ minutes, the receptor continues to promote nucleotide exchange, progressively converting more $G_{s\\alpha}$ into the GTPγS-bound active state. Therefore, the active fraction $f(t)$ monotonically increases toward unity:\n$$\nf(t)\\to 1 \\quad \\text{as}\\quad t\\to \\infty \\text{ for } t>5 \\text{ minutes}.\n$$\n\n4) Consequence for adenylyl cyclase and cAMP. As $f(t)\\to 1$, adenylyl cyclase activity approaches its maximal receptor/$G_s$-mediated stimulation, $A_{\\max}$. The cAMP dynamics then satisfy\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}[cAMP]=v_{\\text{syn}}(A_{\\max}) - k_{\\text{deg}}[cAMP],\n$$\nleading to a new steady state\n$$\n[cAMP]^{*}_{\\text{GTPγS}}=\\frac{v_{\\text{syn}}(A_{\\max})}{k_{\\text{deg}}}.\n$$\nBecause $A_{\\max}\\geq A(f^{*})$ with strict inequality unless $f^{*}=1$, it follows that\n$$\n[cAMP]^{*}_{\\text{GTPγS}} > [cAMP]^{*}_{\\text{agonist}}.\n$$\nMoreover, since termination by hydrolysis is disabled for the trapped active $G_{s\\alpha}$, this elevated state is persistent for as long as GTPγS remains available. Receptor desensitization does not reverse activation of already GTPγS-bound $G_{s\\alpha}$, because activation persists independently of ongoing receptor input once the exchange has occurred. Therefore, cAMP will not decrease toward basal (reject A), will not remain at the prior steady state (reject B), will not oscillate (no mechanism introduced for oscillatory feedback; reject D), and will not slowly decrease due to desensitization in the presence of irreversibly activated $G_{s\\alpha}$ (reject E).\n\n5) Conclusion. With GTPγS present and agonist-saturated receptors continuing to drive nucleotide exchange, $G_{s\\alpha}$ accumulates in the non-hydrolyzable, active state, adenylyl cyclase reaches maximal stimulation, and cAMP becomes persistently and maximally elevated above the agonist-alone steady state.

A significant decrease in the intracellular concentration of cAMP.\nC. No change in the intracellular concentration of cAMP.\nD. A significant decrease in the intracellular concentration of ATP.\nE. Activation of both Gi and Gs signaling pathways simultaneously.", "solution": "Adenosine receptors A1 and A2A are GPCRs that couple to different G proteins with opposite effects on adenylyl cyclase (AC). By definition of GPCR coupling, A1 couples to $G_i$, which inhibits AC, and A2A couples to $G_s$, which stimulates AC. Adenylyl cyclase synthesizes cAMP from ATP; thus AC activity sets the synthesis rate of cAMP. In the basal state (no adenosine), the intracellular cAMP concentration is nonzero and steady, implying a dynamic balance between synthesis and degradation. Denote the cAMP concentration by $C(t)$, AC activity by $A$, the synthesis rate constant by $k_{s}$, and the degradation rate constant (due to phosphodiesterases) by $k_{d}$. A standard mass-balance model for cAMP yields\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{s} A - k_{d} C.\n$$\nIn the absence of adenosine the steady state $C_{0}$ satisfies\n$$\n0 = k_{s} A_{0} - k_{d} C_{0} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k_{s} A_{0} = k_{d} C_{0},\n$$\nwhere $A_{0}$ is the basal AC activity.\n\nAt a very low adenosine concentration, only the high-affinity A1 receptors are significantly activated, while the low-affinity A2A receptors remain essentially inactive. By the principle of $G_i$ coupling, A1 activation decreases AC activity: $A$ is reduced from $A_{0}$ to $A' = A_{0} - \\Delta A$ with $\\Delta A > 0$. Immediately after this reduction, $C$ is still approximately $C_{0}$, but the synthesis term is decreased to $k_{s} A' = k_{s}(A_{0} - \\Delta A) = k_{s} A_{0} - k_{s} \\Delta A$. Therefore, the instantaneous rate of change becomes\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt}\\bigg|_{t^{+}} = \\left(k_{s} A_{0} - k_{s} \\Delta A\\right) - k_{d} C_{0} = \\underbrace{k_{s} A_{0} - k_{d} C_{0}}_{=\\,0} - k_{s} \\Delta A = - k_{s} \\Delta A < 0.\n$$\nBecause $k_{s} \\Delta A > 0$, the immediate effect is a net decrease in $C(t)$, i.e., a significant decrease in intracellular cAMP.\n\nThis rules out an increase in cAMP (A) and no change (C). It also rules out a significant decrease in ATP (D), since AC activity is inhibited and ATP consumption for cAMP synthesis would decrease rather than increase immediately. Finally, simultaneous activation of Gi and Gs (E) is inconsistent with the stated low adenosine level that selectively activates high-affinity A1 but not low-affinity A2A receptors.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immediate effect is a significant decrease in intracellular cAMP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2326472"}]}
