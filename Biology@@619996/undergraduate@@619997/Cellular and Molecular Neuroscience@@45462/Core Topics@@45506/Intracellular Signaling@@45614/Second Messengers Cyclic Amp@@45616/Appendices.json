For G-protein signaling, this switch is the intrinsic GTPase activity of the G-alpha subunit, which hydrolyzes bound $GTP$ to $GDP$. This practice explores a hypothetical scenario where this critical termination step is disabled [@problem_id:2337592], allowing you to predict the consequences on intracellular cAMP levels and understand why controlled signal deactivation is essential for normal cell function.", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying a cell line that expresses a specific G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) which, upon binding its hormone ligand, activates the Gs signaling pathway. In a normal cell, ligand binding causes the associated Gs protein's alpha subunit (Gs-alpha) to release guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The GTP-bound Gs-alpha subunit then activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The signaling is terminated when the Gs-alpha subunit hydrolyzes its bound GTP back to GDP, causing it to become inactive.\n\nThe biologist then engineers a new cell line with a specific mutation in the gene for the Gs-alpha subunit. This mutation renders the Gs-alpha protein completely incapable of hydrolyzing GTP, although it can still bind GTP and activate adenylyl cyclase normally.\n\nIf these mutated cells are briefly exposed to the hormone ligand and then the ligand is washed away, which of the following statements best describes the expected long-term concentration of intracellular cAMP compared to that in a normal cell treated in the same way?\n\nA. The cAMP level will be significantly lower than in a normal cell.\n\nB. The cAMP level will show no significant change from the basal, unstimulated level.\n\nC. The cAMP level will increase transiently and then return to the basal level, just like in a normal cell.\n\nD. The cAMP level will rise and then remain persistently high, well above the basal level.\n\nE. The cAMP level will oscillate with a high frequency.", "solution": "Ligand binding to a Gs-coupled receptor promotes GDP-GTP exchange on the Gs alpha subunit, producing an active GTP-bound Gs-alpha that stimulates adenylyl cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP. Termination in a normal cell relies on the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gs-alpha, which hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, returning Gs-alpha to its inactive form and stopping adenylyl cyclase stimulation.\n\nLet $A(t)$ denote the effective concentration of active, GTP-bound Gs-alpha after a brief ligand pulse and washout. In a normal cell, $A(t)$ decays back to zero due to GTP hydrolysis, with a characteristic rate constant $k_{\\text{h}}>0$, so $A(t)\\to 0$ after the pulse. In the mutant cell, the GTPase activity is abolished, so the hydrolysis rate is effectively zero, $k_{\\text{h}}=0$, and the GTP-bound state persists; after the brief stimulus loads Gs-alpha with GTP, $A(t)$ remains at a positive value $A_{0}>0$ for long times, because there is no intrinsic mechanism to return Gs-alpha to the GDP-bound inactive state.\n\nLet $C(t)$ denote intracellular cAMP concentration. The dynamics can be modeled as\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt}=k_{\\text{AC}}\\,A(t)-k_{\\text{PDE}}\\,C+b,\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{AC}}$ is the proportionality constant for adenylyl cyclase production driven by active Gs-alpha, $k_{\\text{PDE}}$ is the first-order degradation rate constant due to phosphodiesterases, and $b$ is basal cAMP production independent of Gs signaling.\n\nIn a normal cell, after the brief pulse and washout, $A(t)\\to 0$, so the long-term steady state satisfies\n$$\n0=-k_{\\text{PDE}}\\,C_{\\text{ss,normal}}+b \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad C_{\\text{ss,normal}}=\\frac{b}{k_{\\text{PDE}}},\n$$\nwhich is the basal, unstimulated level.

Thus, after an initial rise, cAMP remains persistently elevated above basal rather than returning to baseline.\n\nTherefore, the best description is that cAMP will rise and then remain persistently high, well above the basal level.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2337592"}, {"introduction": "Cells in a complex environment are constantly bombarded with multiple, often conflicting, signals.
