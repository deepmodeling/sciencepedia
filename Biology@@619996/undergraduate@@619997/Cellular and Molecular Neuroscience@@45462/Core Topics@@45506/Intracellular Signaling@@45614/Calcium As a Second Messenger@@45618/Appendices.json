The concentration of free Ca²⁺ in the ER lumen is high, while the concentration in the cytosol is kept very low. This gradient is established and maintained primarily by the Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) pump, which actively transports Ca²⁺ from the cytosol into the ER lumen, a process that requires energy from ATP hydrolysis. This active transport counteracts a slow, passive leak of Ca²⁺ from the ER back into the cytosol through various channels.\n\nA cell biologist is studying intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling and treats a culture of these cells with thapsigargin, a compound known to be a highly specific and irreversible inhibitor of the SERCA pump. Assuming the cells are in a resting state before treatment, what are the expected immediate effects on the steady-state concentrations of free Ca²⁺ in the cytosol and in the ER lumen after the addition of thapsigargin?\n\nA.
