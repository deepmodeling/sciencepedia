The focus of the experiment is the Gq-protein coupled receptor pathway. This pathway is initiated when an agonist binds to a Gq-coupled receptor, leading to the activation of the enzyme Phospholipase C (PLC). Activated PLC then hydrolyzes a membrane lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ($\\text{PIP}_2$), into two distinct second messengers: diacylglycerol ($\\text{DAG}$) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($\\text{IP}_3$).\n\nIn this neuron, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as the main intracellular reservoir for calcium ions ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$). The membrane of the ER is embedded with $\\text{IP}_3$ receptors, which are ligand-gated $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. The binding of $\\text{IP}_3$ to these receptors causes them to open, allowing $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ to flow from the ER lumen into the cytoplasm.\n\nThe experiment proceeds in two steps. First, the neuron is pre-incubated with a solution containing a high concentration of a specific antagonist that binds to and completely blocks the $\\text{IP}_3$ receptors on the ER, rendering them non-functional. Second, after ensuring the antagonist has taken full effect, a potent agonist for the Gq-coupled receptor is added to the culture.\n\nWhich of the following options best describes the immediate effect on the concentration of free $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ in the neuron's cytoplasm, compared to its initial resting level?\n\nA. A massive and rapid increase.\n\nB. A massive and rapid decrease.\n\nC. No significant change.\n\nD. A slow and gradual decrease.\n\nE. A slow and gradual increase.", "solution": "The Gq pathway proceeds as follows: agonist binding to a Gq-coupled receptor activates PLC, which hydrolyzes membrane $\\text{PIP}_2$ into two second messengers, diacylglycerol ($\\text{DAG}$) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($\\text{IP}_3$). In a normal cell, $\\text{IP}_3$ binds to $\\text{IP}_3$ receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), opening ligand-gated $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ channels that release $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ from the ER lumen into the cytosol, producing a rapid increase in cytosolic free $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$.\n\nIn the experiment, the $\\text{IP}_3$ receptors are completely blocked by a specific antagonist before adding the Gq agonist. Therefore, after PLC generates $\\text{IP}_3$ and $\\text{DAG}$, $\\text{IP}_3$ cannot open ER $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, so there is no ER $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ release. Without ER store release, there is also no store depletion to trigger store-operated calcium entry. $\\text{DAG}$ remains in the membrane and can help activate protein kinase C, but PKC activation typically requires both $\\text{DAG}$ and elevated $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, and $\\text{DAG}$ does not by itself cause a rapid, large cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ rise. Basal cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is maintained near its resting set point by pumps and exchangers (e.g., SERCA, PMCA, and $\\text{Na}^{+}/\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ exchange), and blocking $\\text{IP}_3$ receptors does not create an immediate sink that would lower cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ below resting levels.\n\nThus, the hallmark rapid rise in cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is abolished, and no other immediate mechanism produces a significant deviation from the resting cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ level.
