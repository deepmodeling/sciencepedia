The fraction of CaM that is activated, denoted by $Y$, is a function of the intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration, $[Ca^{2+}]$. This relationship can be described by the Hill equation:\n$$Y = \\frac{([Ca^{2+}])^n}{(K_d)^n + ([Ca^{2+}])^n}$$\nHere, $K_d$ represents the effective dissociation constant, a measure of binding affinity, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient, indicating the cooperativity of binding.\n\nFor the normal, wild-type version of calmodulin, the parameters are found to be $K_d = 0.50 \\ \\mu M$ and $n=2$. Suppose a critical cellular process requires that precisely 90% of the calmodulin molecules are in the activated state.\n\nA research team discovers a genetic mutation in CaM that impairs its ability to bind $Ca^{2+}$. This reduces the binding affinity such that the new effective dissociation constant, $K_{d,mut}$, is 5 times larger than the wild-type constant. To ensure the same critical cellular process functions correctly, the cell must still achieve 90% activation of this mutant calmodulin.\n\nWhat intracellular calcium concentration is required to achieve 90% activation of the mutant calmodulin?

The enzyme's ability to autophosphorylate itself at the Thr286 residue is thought to allow it to remain active long after the initial calcium signal has faded, a property essential for Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). This problem presents a classic genetic thought experiment—a \"loss-of-function\" mutation—to help you reason about why preventing this autophosphorylation event is detrimental to the sustained phase of synaptic strengthening [@problem_id:2329620].", "problem": "In the study of synaptic plasticity, Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) is a fundamental process for memory formation, where synaptic connections are strengthened. A crucial molecular player in this process is the Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Following a strong synaptic stimulus, an influx of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors leads to the binding of calcium to the protein calmodulin (CaM). The resulting $Ca^{2+}/CaM$ complex then binds to and activates CaMKII.\n\nA key feature of CaMKII is its ability to autophosphorylate at the threonine-286 (Thr286) residue. This phosphorylation event is thought to be critical for the maintenance of LTP. Consider a hypothetical experiment where hippocampal neurons are engineered to express a mutant form of CaMKII in which the threonine at position 286 has been replaced by an alanine (a T286A mutation). Alanine is an amino acid that cannot be phosphorylated. These engineered neurons fail to exhibit the long-lasting maintenance phase of LTP.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct molecular reason for this observation?\n\nA. The mutant CaMKII cannot remain active after the intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration returns to its basal level.\n\nB. The mutant CaMKII is unable to bind to the $Ca^{2+}/CaM$ complex, preventing its initial activation.\n\nC. The mutation directly prevents CaMKII from phosphorylating AMPA receptors, which is required for their insertion into the membrane.\n\nD. The T286A mutation causes the CaMKII enzyme to become constitutively active, leading to synaptic depression instead of potentiation.\n\nE. The mutation disrupts the ability of individual CaMKII subunits to assemble into a functional dodecameric holoenzyme.", "solution": "1) Following a strong synaptic stimulus, $Ca^{2+}$ enters through NMDA receptors and binds calmodulin (CaM) to form the $Ca^{2+}/CaM$ complex. This complex binds to CaMKII, displacing its autoinhibitory segment and acutely activating the kinase. This initial activation is $Ca^{2+}$-dependent and does not require prior autophosphorylation.\n\n2) In the wild-type holoenzyme, adjacent subunits cross-autophosphorylate at Thr286. Phosphorylation at Thr286 produces $Ca^{2+}$-independent (autonomous) kinase activity by stabilizing an open, active conformation and by promoting CaM trapping, allowing CaMKII to remain active even after $Ca^{2+}$ levels return to baseline and $Ca^{2+}/CaM$ dissociates.\n\n3) The maintenance phase of LTP requires a persistent biochemical signal; autonomous CaMKII activity after $Ca^{2+}$ declines is a key molecular mechanism proposed to sustain enhanced synaptic efficacy, including continued phosphorylation of downstream targets and structural signaling at the postsynaptic density.\n\n4) In the T286A mutant, the threonine at position 286 is replaced by alanine, which cannot be phosphorylated. Therefore, although the mutant CaMKII can still bind $Ca^{2+}/CaM$ and be initially activated during the $Ca^{2+}$ transient, it cannot undergo autophosphorylation at Thr286. As a result, when intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ returns to basal levels and $Ca^{2+}/CaM$ dissociates, the kinase reverts to its inactive state and cannot maintain autonomous activity.\n\n5) Consequently, the loss of CaMKII’s autonomous, $Ca^{2+}$-independent activity directly explains the failure to exhibit the long-lasting maintenance phase of LTP. Evaluating the options: B is incorrect because Thr286 is not the CaM-binding determinant and initial activation still occurs; C is not the direct effect of T286A because substrate phosphorylation can occur during $Ca^{2+}/CaM$-bound activation; D is the opposite of the mutant’s effect (constitutive activation is associated with phosphomimetic mutants like T286D); E is not a known consequence of T286A, as holoenzyme assembly is preserved. Therefore, the most direct molecular reason is that the mutant cannot remain active after $Ca^{2+}$ returns to basal levels.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2329620"}, {"introduction": "To further solidify our understanding of CaMKII's molecular switch, we now explore the opposite scenario: what if the enzyme were permanently locked in its \"on\" state? Molecular biologists use \"phosphomimetic\" mutations, which structurally and electrostatically mimic a phosphorylated amino acid, to probe such questions. By predicting the behavior of a CaMKII enzyme with an aspartate residue at the key Thr286 position, this exercise [@problem_id:2329622] allows you to explore the direct consequences of this theoretical \"gain-of-function\" mutation, a powerful complement to the loss-of-function scenario in the previous practice.", "problem": "The enzyme Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a crucial mediator of synaptic plasticity in the brain. In its resting state, each CaMKII subunit is kept inactive by an autoinhibitory domain that physically blocks its catalytic site. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration leads to the formation of a Calcium/Calmodulin ($Ca^{2+}/CaM$) complex, which binds to CaMKII and displaces the autoinhibitory domain, thereby activating the enzyme.\n\nOnce activated, a CaMKII subunit can phosphorylate an adjacent subunit at a specific threonine residue, Thr286. This autophosphorylation event introduces a bulky, negatively charged phosphate group. This modification serves to \"trap\" the enzyme in an active state, allowing it to remain active for a period even after intracellular calcium levels have returned to baseline and the $Ca^{2+}/CaM$ complex has dissociated.\n\nImagine a molecular biology experiment where the gene for CaMKII is mutated. The mutation replaces the threonine residue at position 286 with an aspartate (Asp) residue. The side chain of aspartate is negatively charged at physiological pH and is often used in such experiments to mimic the electrostatic properties of a phosphate group. Based on this information, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the functional state of this Thr286-to-Aspartate (T286D) mutant CaMKII?\n\nA. The mutant CaMKII will be constitutively active, showing significant kinase activity even in the absence of Ca2+ and Calmodulin.\n\nB.

The mutant CaMKII will have a regulatory mechanism identical to the normal, wild-type enzyme.\n\nD. The mutant CaMKII will require much higher concentrations of $Ca^{2+}/CaM$ to become activated compared to the wild-type enzyme.\n\nE. The mutant CaMKII will be activated by Ca2+ alone, without the need for Calmodulin.", "solution": "CaMKII regulation involves an autoinhibitory domain that blocks the catalytic site in the absence of $Ca^{2+}/CaM$. Binding of $Ca^{2+}/CaM$ displaces this autoinhibition and activates the kinase. Once active, a CaMKII subunit can phosphorylate a neighboring subunit at Thr286. The added phosphate introduces a bulky, negatively charged group that stabilizes an active, autonomous conformation, allowing activity to persist even after $Ca^{2+}/CaM$ dissociates.\n\nIn a T286D mutant, the threonine is replaced by aspartate. Aspartate bears a negative charge at physiological pH and is commonly used as a phosphomimetic to approximate the electrostatic effect of phosphorylation. Therefore:\n1. The key functional consequence of Thr286 phosphorylation—stabilization of an open, active conformation and autonomous activity—is primarily due to the negative charge introduced at position 286.\n2. Substituting Asp at 286 mimics this negative charge, thus favoring the active, $Ca^{2+}/CaM$-independent (autonomous) state.\n3. As a result, the mutant is expected to display significant kinase activity even without $Ca^{2+}/CaM$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A matches the prediction: constitutive/autonomous activity in the absence of $Ca^{2+}/CaM$.\n- B is incorrect, as the mutation does not enforce permanent inactivity; it mimics activation.\n- C is incorrect, because the regulatory mechanism is altered toward autonomous activity, unlike wild type.\n- D is incorrect, as the requirement for $Ca^{2+}/CaM$ is reduced, not increased.\n- E is incorrect, since activation in the mutant does not depend on $Ca^{2+}$ alone; rather, it is autonomous.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is that the T286D mutant is constitutively active.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2329622"}]}
