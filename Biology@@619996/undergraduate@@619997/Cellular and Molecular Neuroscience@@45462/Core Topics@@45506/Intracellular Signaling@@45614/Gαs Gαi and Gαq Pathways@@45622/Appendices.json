These neurons express a specific G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that, upon binding to its agonist, activates a stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit ($G\\alpha_s$). The canonical signaling pathway for this receptor involves the following steps:\n1. The activated $G\\alpha_s$ subunit stimulates the membrane-bound enzyme, adenylyl cyclase.\n2. Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into cyclic adenosine monophosphate ($cAMP$), a key second messenger.\n3. The signaling action of $cAMP$ is terminated by the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE), which hydrolyzes $cAMP$ into an inactive form, 5'-AMP.\n\nThe researcher treats the neuron culture with two substances simultaneously: a high concentration of a specific agonist for the $G\\alpha_s$-coupled receptor, and a compound known to be a potent inhibitor of PDE activity.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following outcomes describes the most likely effect on the intracellular concentration of $cAMP$ in these neurons, compared to treating them with the agonist alone?\n\nA. The $cAMP$ level will increase, but the magnitude and duration of the increase will be identical to that produced by the agonist alone.\n\nB. The $cAMP$ level will show a synergistic effect, resulting in a much larger and more prolonged increase.\n\nC. The $cAMP$ level will ultimately decrease, as the PDE inhibitor will create a negative feedback loop that shuts down adenylyl cyclase.\n\nD. The $cAMP$ level will not change from the baseline, as the actions of the agonist and the PDE inhibitor have opposing effects that cancel each other out.\n\nE. The $cAMP$ level will show a brief, transient increase followed by a rapid fall to below the baseline level.", "solution": "The receptor couples to the stimulatory G-protein $G\\alpha_{s}$, which increases adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity when its agonist is present. AC converts ATP to $cAMP$, and phosphodiesterase (PDE) terminates $cAMP$ signaling by hydrolyzing $cAMP$ to $5^{\\prime}$-AMP.\n\nThe intracellular $cAMP$ dynamics can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{cAMP}]}{dt}=v_{\\text{AC}}-v_{\\text{PDE}}([\\text{cAMP}]).\n$$\nAgonist alone increases $v_{\\text{AC}}$, so $[\\text{cAMP}]$ rises until a new dynamic steady state satisfies:\n$$\nv_{\\text{AC}}=v_{\\text{PDE}}([\\text{cAMP}]_{\\text{ss}}).\n$$\nIntroducing a potent PDE inhibitor decreases PDE catalytic activity (for example, an effective decrease in $V_{\\max,\\text{PDE}}$ or the apparent first-order rate constant $k_{\\text{deg}}$ when PDE is unsaturated). With $v_{\\text{AC}}$ elevated by the agonist and $v_{\\text{PDE}}$ reduced by the inhibitor, the production-to-degradation imbalance increases:\n$$\nv_{\\text{AC}}-v_{\\text{PDE}}^{\\text{(inhibited)}}>v_{\\text{AC}}-v_{\\text{PDE}}^{\\text{(baseline)}},\n$$\nso $[\\text{cAMP}]$ rises to a larger magnitude. At steady state, because the inhibited $v_{\\text{PDE}}$ is smaller for any given $[\\text{cAMP}]$, the equality $v_{\\text{AC}}=v_{\\text{PDE}}$ is restored only at a higher $[\\text{cAMP}]_{\\text{ss}}$. Moreover, the effective decay time constant is increased; under first-order approximation,\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{cAMP}]}{dt}\\approx v_{\\text{AC}}-k_{\\text{deg}}[\\text{cAMP}],\n$$\nso reducing $k_{\\text{deg}}$ both prolongs the response and elevates the peak and steady-state levels.\n\nTherefore, compared with agonist alone, co-application of a PDE inhibitor yields a much larger and more prolonged increase in $cAMP$. This rules out identical magnitude/duration (A), a decrease via negative feedback (C), no change via cancellation (D), and a brief spike followed by a drop below baseline (E), because inhibition of degradation prevents rapid clearance and promotes accumulation while AC is activated.\n\nThe most likely outcome is a synergistic effect on $cAMP$ magnitude and duration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2338218"}, {"introduction": "Experimental pharmacology provides powerful tools for dissecting which signaling pathway is active in a given cell.
