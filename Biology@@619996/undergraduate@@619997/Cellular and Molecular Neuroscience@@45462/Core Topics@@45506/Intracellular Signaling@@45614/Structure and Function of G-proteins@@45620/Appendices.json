This first practice problem explores a scenario where the built-in \"off-switch\" of a stimulatory G-protein, its ability to hydrolyze GTP, is broken. By analyzing this hypothetical mutation, you will develop a clear understanding of why this GTPase activity is essential for preventing runaway signaling and maintaining cellular homeostasis. [@problem_id:2351272]", "problem": "In a cellular biology laboratory, a team is investigating a stable cell line derived from an endocrine tumor. These cells exhibit a specific point mutation in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G-protein, denoted as $G_{\\alpha s}$. The baseline function of the G-protein signaling pathway is as follows: upon receptor activation by a hormone, the inactive $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit (bound to Guanosine Diphosphate, or GDP) exchanges GDP for Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). The now-active $G_{\\alpha s}$-GTP complex dissociates from its partner beta-gamma subunits and activates the membrane-bound enzyme, adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase then catalyzes the conversion of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) into cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), a crucial second messenger. The signal is normally terminated when the intrinsic GTPase activity of the $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit hydrolyzes GTP back to GDP, rendering it inactive.\n\nThe specific mutation in the tumor cell line completely abolishes the intrinsic GTPase activity of the $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit, preventing it from hydrolyzing GTP. If both these mutant cells and normal (wild-type) cells are continuously exposed to a hormone that activates this pathway, what would be the predicted state of intracellular cAMP concentration in the mutant cells compared to the wild-type cells?\n\nA. The cAMP concentration will be significantly and persistently elevated.\n\nB. The cAMP concentration will be significantly and persistently decreased.\n\nC.

The cAMP concentration will show an initial spike similar to wild-type cells but will then rapidly fall to near-zero levels.\n\nE. The cAMP concentration will not change from the basal level, as the G-protein cannot be activated.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of a specific mutation on the G-protein signaling pathway, particularly on the intracellular concentration of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP). Let's analyze the signaling cascade step by step in both normal (wild-type) and mutant cells.\n\n**Step 1: The G-protein Cycle in Wild-Type Cells**\n1.  **Resting State:** In the absence of a hormonal signal, the stimulatory G-protein exists as an inactive heterotrimer consisting of $G_{\\alpha s}$, $G_{\\beta}$, and $G_{\\gamma}$ subunits. The $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit is bound to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP).\n2.  **Activation:** A hormone binds to its specific G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR). This causes the GPCR to undergo a conformational change, allowing it to interact with the G-protein heterotrimer. The GPCR then acts as a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF), catalyzing the release of GDP from the $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit and the binding of a molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), which is more abundant in the cytosol.\n3.  **Effector Activation:** The binding of GTP to $G_{\\alpha s}$ causes another conformational change, leading to the dissociation of the active $G_{\\alpha s}$-GTP complex from the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer. This $G_{\\alpha s}$-GTP complex is the active form of the subunit. It diffuses along the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane until it encounters and binds to the effector enzyme, adenylyl cyclase. This binding activates adenylyl cyclase.\n4.  **Signal Amplification:** Activated adenylyl cyclase converts a large number of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecules into cAMP molecules. This leads to a rapid increase in the intracellular concentration of cAMP, which then goes on to activate downstream targets like Protein Kinase A (PKA).\n5.  **Signal Termination:** The G-protein signaling pathway has a built-in \"off\" switch. The $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit possesses intrinsic GTPase activity, meaning it can slowly hydrolyze the bound GTP to GDP and an inorganic phosphate ($P_i$). This hydrolysis converts the active $G_{\\alpha s}$-GTP back into its inactive $G_{\\alpha s}$-GDP form.\n6.  **Re-association:** The inactive $G_{\\alpha s}$-GDP has a high affinity for the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer and re-associates with it to reform the inactive heterotrimer, ready to be activated again. This termination step ensures that the signal is transient and proportional to the duration of the hormonal stimulus.\n\n**Step 2: The G-protein Cycle in the Mutant Cells**\nThe problem states that the mutation in the tumor cell line completely abolishes the intrinsic GTPase activity of the $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit. Let's trace the consequences.\n\n1.  **Activation (Steps 1-4) Proceeds Normally:** The mutant cells can still be stimulated by the hormone. The GPCR will be activated, and it will catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on the mutant $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit. The active $G_{\\alpha s}$-GTP complex will dissociate and activate adenylyl cyclase, leading to the production of cAMP.\n2.  **Failure of Signal Termination (Step 5 Fails):** Here is the critical difference. In the mutant cells, the $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit cannot hydrolyze its bound GTP. The \"off\" switch is broken.\n3.  **Consequence:** Because GTP hydrolysis cannot occur, the $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit remains locked in its active, GTP-bound state. It is constitutively (persistently) active. As long as it is bound to GTP, it will continuously stimulate adenylyl cyclase.\n4.  **Effect on cAMP:** This continuous, unchecked activation of adenylyl cyclase will lead to a massive and sustained production of cAMP. Therefore, the intracellular concentration of cAMP in the mutant cells will be significantly and persistently elevated far above the levels seen in wild-type cells, where the signal is properly terminated after a short period. This condition is often referred to as constitutive activation of the signaling pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A. The cAMP concentration will be significantly and persistently elevated.** This matches our conclusion. The broken \"off\" switch leads to continuous signaling.\n*   **B. The cAMP concentration will be significantly and persistently decreased.** This is incorrect. The mutation affects the deactivation step, not the activation step. A decrease would imply the protein is less active or cannot be activated.\n*   **C. The cAMP concentration will be identical to that of wild-type cells, as the beta-gamma subunits will compensate.** This is incorrect. The $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ subunits have their own signaling roles but cannot hydrolyze GTP on the $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit or otherwise compensate for its constitutive activation in this context.\n*   **D. The cAMP concentration will show an initial spike similar to wild-type cells but will then rapidly fall to near-zero levels.** This is the opposite of what happens. The signal is prolonged, not prematurely terminated. A rapid fall would require an enhanced deactivation mechanism, not a disabled one.\n*   **E. The cAMP concentration will not change from the basal level, as the G-protein cannot be activated.** This is incorrect. The mutation does not prevent activation (GTP binding); it prevents deactivation (GTP hydrolysis).\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction is that the loss of GTPase activity leads to a constitutively active $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit, resulting in a persistent and significant elevation of cAMP levels.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2351272"}, {"introduction": "Having seen the consequences of a signal that cannot be terminated, we now pivot to the opposite scenario: a signal that can never begin. This exercise presents a hypothetical neurotoxin that locks an inhibitory G-protein, $G_i$, in its inactive GDP-bound state. This practice will solidify your understanding of the activation step, highlighting that the exchange of GDP for GTP is the non-negotiable gateway to G-protein signaling. [@problem_id:2351235]", "problem": "In cellular signaling, many neurotransmitters exert their effects by binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). One such class of receptors is coupled to an inhibitory Guanine nucleotide-binding protein, known as $G_i$. The $G_i$ protein is a heterotrimer composed of $\\alpha_i$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ subunits.\n\nThe canonical signaling cascade is as follows:\n1. In the inactive state, the $\\alpha_i$ subunit is bound to Guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and is complexed with the $\\beta\\gamma$ dimer.\n2. Upon binding of an inhibitory neurotransmitter to the GPCR, the receptor undergoes a conformational change.\n3. This change causes the $\\alpha_i$ subunit to release GDP and bind to Guanosine triphosphate (GTP).\n4. The now active $\\alpha_i$-GTP subunit dissociates from both the receptor and the $\\beta\\gamma$ dimer.\n5. The free $\\alpha_i$-GTP subunit then binds to and inhibits the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, reducing the intracellular production of the second messenger cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nA team of neuropharmacologists has isolated a novel peptide toxin from a marine cone snail. Their research reveals that this toxin has a singular, highly specific effect: it covalently modifies the $\\alpha_i$ subunit, permanently trapping it in its GDP-bound conformation. This modification prevents the subunit from ever exchanging GDP for GTP, regardless of the status of the associated GPCR.\n\nIf a neuron is treated with this toxin and is then stimulated by the appropriate inhibitory neurotransmitter that normally acts via the $G_i$ pathway, what will be the resulting effect on adenylyl cyclase activity?\n\nA. Adenylyl cyclase will be inhibited more strongly than without the toxin.\n\nB. Adenylyl cyclase will be constitutively activated, leading to a large increase in cAMP levels.\n\nC. Adenylyl cyclase activity will be unaffected by the neurotransmitter, failing to be inhibited.\n\nD. Adenylyl cyclase will be transiently inhibited before returning to its basal activity level.", "solution": "The canonical requirement for adenylyl cyclase inhibition via the $G_{i}$ pathway is the formation of free $\\alpha_{i}$ bound to GTP, i.e., the active species $\\alpha_{i}\\text{-GTP}$. In the resting state, $\\alpha_{i}$ is GDP-bound and remains associated with the $\\beta\\gamma$ dimer as a heterotrimer. Upon inhibitory GPCR activation, the receptor acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that catalyzes GDP release and GTP binding on $\\alpha_{i}$; this generates $\\alpha_{i}\\text{-GTP}$, which dissociates from $\\beta\\gamma$ and directly binds to and inhibits adenylyl cyclase, thereby decreasing cyclic AMP production. Thus, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase strictly requires the GDP-to-GTP exchange on $\\alpha_{i}$ and subsequent dissociation to yield free $\\alpha_{i}\\text{-GTP}$.\n\nThe peptide toxin covalently locks $\\alpha_{i}$ in the GDP-bound conformation and prevents GDP-GTP exchange regardless of receptor activation. Therefore:\n- The necessary active species $\\alpha_{i}\\text{-GTP}$ cannot form.\n- The $\\alpha_{i}$ subunit remains GDP-bound within the heterotrimer with $\\beta\\gamma$, preventing dissociation and eliminating any $\\beta\\gamma$-mediated effects that would require trimer dissociation.\n- Because no $\\alpha_{i}\\text{-GTP}$ is produced, adenylyl cyclase is not inhibited in response to the inhibitory neurotransmitter.\n\nThis rules out stronger-than-normal inhibition (no activation of $G_{i}$ occurs), rules out transient inhibition (no momentary formation of $\\alpha_{i}\\text{-GTP}$), and does not imply constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase (that would require $G_{s}$ activation or removal of all inhibitory tone; the toxin merely prevents the inhibitory neurotransmitter from exerting its effect). Consequently, adenylyl cyclase activity is unaffected by the inhibitory neurotransmitter stimulus under toxin treatment.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that adenylyl cyclase activity will be unaffected by the neurotransmitter, failing to be inhibited.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2351235"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates our analysis from the G-protein's cycle to its very architecture, treating it as a modular machine with interchangeable parts.

They create a novel chimeric G-alpha subunit, designated $G_{\\alpha, \\text{chimera}}$. This engineered protein is constructed using the primary amino acid sequence of a $G_{\\alpha q}$ subunit as a backbone. However, the region known as \"Switch II\", which is a critical determinant of effector protein binding, is precisely swapped with the corresponding Switch II region from a $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit. All other domains of the $G_{\\alpha q}$ subunit, including the helical domain and the C-terminus that are crucial for interaction with G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), are left unchanged.\n\nThis $G_{\\alpha, \\text{chimera}}$ is then expressed in a specially designed cell line. This cell line contains a functional population of a specific subtype of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) that, under normal physiological conditions, exclusively couples to and activates $G_q$ family proteins. The cell line also possesses the full complement of common effector enzymes, such as phospholipase C (PLC) and adenylyl cyclase (AC), and their associated downstream signaling machinery.

The chimeric G-protein will non-selectively activate both phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase.", "solution": "We identify the modular determinants of G-protein function that are relevant here:\n1) GPCR coupling and activation of the heterotrimeric G protein are primarily determined by the $G_{\\alpha}$ C-terminal residues and adjacent regions that dock into the activated receptor. In this chimera, the C-terminus and helical domain are from $G_{\\alpha q}$, so an mGluR that normally couples to $G_{q}$ will recognize and activate $G_{\\alpha, \\text{chimera}}$.\n2) Effector specificity (which enzyme the GTP-bound $G_{\\alpha}$ engages) is largely determined by the conformation and residues in the Switch regions, especially Switch II (and contacts with Switch III/alpha3-helix). In this chimera, Switch II is swapped from $G_{\\alpha s}$, so the effector interface is $G_{s}$-like.\n\nUnder saturating glutamate, the receptor $R$ becomes active, $R^{*}$, and catalyzes GDP-GTP exchange on the associated $G_{\\alpha}$:\n$$R^{*} + G_{\\alpha, \\text{chimera}}\\text{-GDP} \\rightleftharpoons R^{*}\\cdot G_{\\alpha, \\text{chimera}}\\text{-GDP} \\rightarrow R^{*} + G_{\\alpha, \\text{chimera}}\\text{-GTP}.$$\nBecause the C-terminus is from $G_{\\alpha q}$, the coupling between $R^{*}$ and $G_{\\alpha, \\text{chimera}}$ is preserved, so activation (GEF-catalyzed GDP release and GTP binding) proceeds efficiently. Therefore option C is excluded.\n\nOnce in the GTP-bound state, the effector surface presented by $G_{\\alpha, \\text{chimera}}$ is determined by its Switch II. Let $E_{\\text{PLC}}$ denote phospholipase C and $E_{\\text{AC}}$ denote adenylyl cyclase. The binding and activation propensities are governed by the Switch II-determined interfaces:\n- For a $G_{q}$-type Switch II, one expects tight interaction with $E_{\\text{PLC}}$ and poor interaction with $E_{\\text{AC}}$.\n- For a $G_{s}$-type Switch II, one expects tight interaction with $E_{\\text{AC}}$ and poor interaction with $E_{\\text{PLC}}$.\n\nHere, Switch II is $G_{s}$-type, so the affinities satisfy qualitatively $K_{d}^{\\text{AC}} \\ll K_{d}^{\\text{PLC}}$.

Because endogenous $G_{\\alpha s}$ and $G_{\\alpha q}$ are knocked out, this effect is attributable to the chimera. Therefore option D is excluded (the chimera can engage an effector), option A is excluded (PLC activation requires a $G_{q}$-type effector interface that is not present), and option E is excluded (effector specificity is not non-selective; the Switch II swap confers $G_{s}$-like selectivity).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the primary downstream event mediated by the activated $G_{\\alpha, \\text{chimera}}$ is activation of adenylyl cyclase with increased cAMP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2351276"}]}
