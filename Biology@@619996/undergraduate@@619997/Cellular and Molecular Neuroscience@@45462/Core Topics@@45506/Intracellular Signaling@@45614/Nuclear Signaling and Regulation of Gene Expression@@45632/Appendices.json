This problem provides a hands-on thought experiment involving a core concept: transcriptional repression. By analyzing a common laboratory scenario that uses RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete a repressor protein, you will practice predicting the direct consequences on gene expression, reinforcing the fundamental logic of negative regulation. [@problem_id:2346697]", "problem": "In a neuroscience research laboratory, a team is investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying a specific neurodevelopmental disorder. Their research focuses on a protein known as methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), which is crucial for normal brain function. In healthy neurons, MeCP2 binds to methylated DNA sequences and acts as a transcriptional repressor, thereby silencing the expression of its specific target genes.\n\nTo explore the consequences of MeCP2 loss, the researchers introduce a specially designed short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) into a culture of healthy, developing neurons. A short-hairpin RNA is an engineered RNA molecule that, once inside a cell, leads to the targeted degradation of a specific and complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. The shRNA used in this experiment is designed to be complementary to the mRNA that codes for the MeCP2 protein.\n\nAssuming the experimental procedure is successful, what is the most likely direct consequence for the set of genes that are normally regulated by the MeCP2 protein?\n\nA. The expression of the target genes will increase.\n\nB. The expression of the target genes will decrease.\n\nC. The rate of DNA methylation will increase specifically at the target gene loci.\n\nD. The expression of all genes in the neuron will decrease non-specifically.\n\nE. There will be no change in the expression of the target genes.", "solution": "1. State the regulatory role of MeCP2: In healthy neurons, MeCP2 binds methylated CpG sites on DNA and functions as a transcriptional repressor for its target genes. Denote the expression level of a MeCP2 target gene by $E_{\\text{target}}$ and the intracellular concentration of MeCP2 by $[{\\rm MeCP2}]$.

Describe the effect of the introduced shRNA: The shRNA is designed to be complementary to the MeCP2 mRNA. By the RNA interference mechanism, the shRNA is processed and guides the RNA-induced silencing complex to the complementary MeCP2 mRNA, leading to its degradation and a reduction in MeCP2 protein synthesis. Symbolically, this yields a decrease in MeCP2 protein level,\n$$\n[{\\rm MeCP2}] \\downarrow,\n$$\nas a direct consequence of targeted mRNA degradation.\n\n3. Infer the consequence for target gene expression: Because MeCP2 is a repressor, reducing $[{\\rm MeCP2}]$ reduces repression, leading to derepression of its targets. Using the monotonic relationship above, a decrease in $[{\\rm MeCP2}]$ implies an increase in $E_{\\text{target}}$:\n$$\n[{\\rm MeCP2}] \\downarrow \\;\\Rightarrow\\; E_{\\text{target}} \\uparrow.\n$$\n\n4. Exclude alternative options based on mechanism:\n- A reduction of a repressor cannot directly cause decreased expression of its targets, so choice B is inconsistent.\n- shRNA action targets mRNA and does not directly alter DNA methylation machinery at specific loci, so choice C is not supported.\n- RNA interference is sequence-specific; it does not globally reduce expression of all genes, so choice D is incorrect.\n- Loss of a repressor necessarily alters expression of its targets (derepression), so choice E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most likely direct consequence is increased expression of the MeCP2 target genes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2346697"}, {"introduction": "Gene regulation is not a static process; it is a dynamic system that unfolds over time. This exercise moves beyond simple on/off switches to explore a fundamental regulatory circuit: the negative feedback loop. By modeling the response to a transient stimulus, you will develop an intuition for how such circuits generate precise, pulse-like patterns of gene expression, a common feature in cellular signaling. [@problem_id:2346667]", "problem": "In a simplified model of neuronal gene expression, a neuron at rest contains a pool of an inactive transcription factor known as Neuronal Activity Factor (NAF). A brief, transient depolarization event triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the rapid phosphorylation of NAF, converting it into its active form, pNAF.\n\nActive pNAF immediately enters the nucleus and binds to the promoter of a specific target gene, `Gene-R`, initiating its transcription. The messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from `Gene-R` is then translated into a protein called Repressor Phosphatase (RP). The function of the RP protein is to dephosphorylate pNAF, rendering it inactive and unable to bind to the promoter of `Gene-R`.\n\nAssume the following conditions:\n1.  Before the depolarization event, the system is in a steady state with virtually zero concentration of `Gene-R` mRNA and RP protein.\n2.  The initial depolarization event is a single, short pulse, after which the initial signaling cascade ceases.\n3.  Both `Gene-R` mRNA and the RP protein are continuously degraded by cellular machinery at constant rates.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the expected change in the concentration of `Gene-R` mRNA over time, starting from the moment of the depolarization event?\n\nA. The mRNA concentration will rapidly increase and then stabilize at a new, constant, elevated level.\n\nB. The mRNA concentration will rise to a peak level and then decline back towards its initial baseline level.\n\nC. The mRNA concentration will show no significant change because the repressor protein is produced simultaneously and prevents any increase.\n\nD. The mRNA concentration will begin to oscillate, continuously rising and falling in a sustained, periodic manner.\n\nE.

A brief depolarization at $t=0$ creates an initial pool $P(0)=P_{0}>0$ of active pNAF, after which no further activation occurs (assumption 2). Before $t=0$, $M(0)=0$ and $R(0)=0$ (assumption 1). Both $M$ and $R$ are degraded at constant rates (assumption 3). The regulatory logic is:\n- pNAF activates transcription of $Gene$-$R$;\n- $Gene$-$R$ mRNA is translated into RP;\n- RP dephosphorylates pNAF, inactivating it.\n\nA minimal set of ordinary differential equations consistent with these statements is\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt}=-k_{p}P-k_{rp}RP, \\quad \\frac{dM}{dt}=\\alpha P-\\gamma_{m}M, \\quad \\frac{dR}{dt}=\\beta M-\\gamma_{r}R,\n$$\nwith constants $k_{p}\\ge 0$, $k_{rp}>0$, $\\alpha>0$, $\\beta>0$, $\\gamma_{m}>0$, $\\gamma_{r}>0$. The term $-k_{rp}RP$ captures RP-dependent dephosphorylation of pNAF; the term $-k_{p}P$ allows for any RP-independent loss of pNAF (its inclusion is not essential for the qualitative conclusion).\n\nImmediately after $t=0$, $R(0)=0$, so $P$ either decays at rate $k_{p}$ if $k_{p}>0$, or remains approximately constant on a very short time scale if $k_{p}=0$ until $R$ builds up. In either case, for small $t>0$, $P(t)\\ge 0$ and\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt}=\\alpha P-\\gamma_{m}M>0 \\quad \\text{since} \\quad M(0)=0 \\ \\text{and} \\ P(0)=P_{0}>0,\n$$\nso $M(t)$ initially rises from zero. As $M$ increases, $R$ increases according to\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt}=\\beta M-\\gamma_{r}R>0 \\quad \\text{initially},\n$$\nwhich in turn increases the effective dephosphorylation rate of $P$ via $-k_{rp}RP$. Consequently, $P(t)$ declines toward zero. Once $P$ has been sufficiently reduced, the transcriptional production term $\\alpha P$ in $\\frac{dM}{dt}$ vanishes, leaving\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt}=-\\gamma_{m}M,\n$$\nwhich implies exponential decay of $M(t)$ back toward its baseline near zero. The unique steady state in the absence of continued input is $P^{*}=0$, $M^{*}=0$, $R^{*}=0$, and the Jacobian at this point has eigenvalues $-k_{p}$, $-\\gamma_{m}$, $-\\gamma_{r}$ (all nonpositive, strictly negative if $k_{p}>0$), demonstrating return to baseline without sustained oscillations. There is no mechanism for a new elevated steady state because the input is a single pulse and transcription stops once $P\\to 0$. There is also no immediate prevention of mRNA increase because RP production lags transcription and translation.\n\nTherefore, the qualitative time course of $M(t)$ is a transient rise to a peak followed by decay toward the initial baseline, which corresponds to option B. Options A and D require sustained input or specific delayed nonlinearities to maintain a nonzero or oscillatory steady behavior, which are absent here; option C ignores production delays; option E contradicts the near-zero baseline and the activation by pNAF.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2346667"}, {"introduction": "Effective gene regulation depends on more than just local interactions at a promoter; it also relies on the large-scale, three-dimensional architecture of the genome.

[@problem_id:2346668]", "problem": "In mammalian genomes, chromatin is organized into discrete structural and regulatory units called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). The boundaries of these domains are often demarcated by binding sites for the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which acts as an insulator, preventing enhancers in one TAD from inappropriately activating promoters in an adjacent TAD.\n\nConsider a specific population of hippocampal neurons. In a healthy individual, two genes, `Gene M` and `Gene P`, reside in adjacent TADs.\n- `Gene M` encodes a crucial subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. It is under the control of a weak, constitutive promoter, ensuring a constant, stable level of expression necessary for baseline mitochondrial function.\n- `Gene P` encodes a protein essential for synaptic plasticity.

In the healthy state, Gene $M$ and Gene $P$ lie in adjacent TADs separated by a CTCF site. Gene $M$ has a weak constitutive promoter that maintains stable baseline expression necessary for mitochondrial ATP synthase stoichiometry and function. Gene $P$ carries a powerful enhancer that is quiescent at baseline but becomes strongly activated by calcium-dependent signaling during high-frequency synaptic stimulation (HFS).\n\nA precise microdeletion that removes the CTCF site fuses the adjacent TADs into a single interaction domain. The immediate mechanistic consequence is that the powerful, activity-dependent enhancer for Gene $P$ can now ectopically contact promoters in the formerly insulated neighboring TAD, including the weak constitutive promoter of Gene $M$. This does not inherently repress Gene $M$; rather, it enables inappropriate activation of Gene $M$ when the enhancer is active.\n\n(i) Basal synaptic activity: Calcium-dependent pathways are not strongly engaged; the Gene $P$ enhancer remains inactive. Without enhancer activity, there is no new ectopic activation of Gene $M$, so Gene $M$ continues at its weak constitutive level. Mitochondrial ATP synthase stoichiometry and function remain normal under basal conditions.\n\n(ii) Prolonged HFS: Calcium-dependent signaling robustly activates the Gene $P$ enhancer. Due to boundary loss, this enhancer can now drive transcription not only of Gene $P$ but also of Gene $M$. Because Gene $M$ encodes a single subunit of the ATP synthase complex, its disproportionate upregulation disrupts stoichiometric balance and assembly, causing accumulation of orphan subunits, proteostatic and mitochondrial unfolded-protein stress, impaired respiratory chain efficiency, and increased reactive oxygen species. The resulting mitochondrial dysfunction under strong, sustained enhancer drive favors apoptotic, rather than adaptive, outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the cellular phenotype is: (i) normal mitochondrial function at baseline, and (ii) drastic overexpression of Gene $M$ upon HFS with stoichiometric imbalance, severe oxidative stress, and apoptotic cell death.
