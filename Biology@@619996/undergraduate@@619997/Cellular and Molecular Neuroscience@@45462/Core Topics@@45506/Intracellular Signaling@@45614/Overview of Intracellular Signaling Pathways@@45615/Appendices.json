The very first step, the activation of the receptor itself, is a physical event—a conformational change—that is absolutely essential for transmitting a signal. This exercise, focusing on a hypothetical toxin, allows you to probe the consequences of blocking this critical structural shift and solidifies your understanding of how a GPCR initiates communication with its G-protein partner [@problem_id:2347533].", "problem": "A specific class of neurons in the central nervous system utilizes a metabotropic signaling pathway initiated by a neurotransmitter. The binding of this neurotransmitter to its specific G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) normally triggers a conformational change in the receptor. This change allows the receptor to interact with an associated heterotrimeric G-protein, which consists of an alpha, a beta, and a gamma subunit. In its inactive state, the G-protein's alpha subunit is bound to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and complexed with the beta-gamma dimer.\n\nA newly synthesized compound, 'Rigiditoxin', is found to be a potent antagonist for this receptor. After extensive analysis, its mechanism is elucidated: Rigiditoxin allows the neurotransmitter to bind to the GPCR, but it chemically cross-links the intracellular loops of the receptor, completely preventing any change in the receptor's three-dimensional structure.\n\nAssuming the neuron is initially in a resting state and is then exposed to both the native neurotransmitter and Rigiditoxin, which of the following statements accurately describes the immediate state of the G-protein alpha subunit?\n\nA. It will bind Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) and dissociate from the beta-gamma dimer.\n\nB. It will remain bound to GDP and associated with the beta-gamma dimer.\n\nC. It will become catalytically active and phosphorylate a downstream target.\n\nD. It will dissociate from the receptor and be targeted for ubiquitination and degradation.\n\nE. It will exchange its GDP for a molecule of the neurotransmitter.", "solution": "We analyze the canonical GPCR-G protein signaling sequence and the effect of preventing receptor conformational change.\n\n1) Resting state of the heterotrimeric G protein:\nBy definition, in the absence of receptor activation, the alpha subunit is GDP-bound and complexed with the beta-gamma dimer. Denote the alpha, beta-gamma subunits and their nucleotide state as $G_{\\alpha}$, $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$, and GDP or GTP, respectively. The resting complex is\n$$G_{\\alpha}\\text{-GDP}\\cdot G_{\\beta\\gamma}.$$\n\n2) Normal activation sequence without antagonist:\nLigand binding to the GPCR induces an active receptor conformation $R^{*}$ with guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity for $G_{\\alpha}$.

Therefore, even though ligand binds, the receptor remains in the inactive conformation and lacks GEF activity:\n$$R + T \\to R\\text{-}T,\\quad R\\text{-}T + L \\to R\\text{-}T\\cdot L,$$\nwith no transition to $R^{*}$. Consequently, there is no catalysis of GDP release from $G_{\\alpha}$ and no GDP-to-GTP exchange.

This practice problem explores the crucial role of signal termination, focusing on the intrinsic GTPase activity of the G-protein alpha subunit which acts as a built-in timer. By considering a hypothetical mutation that disables this \"off-switch,\" you will investigate the concept of constitutive activation and its profound impact on downstream effector enzymes like adenylyl cyclase [@problem_id:2347579].", "problem": "In many neurons, signaling through certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) activates a stimulatory G-protein, which consists of $\\alpha_s$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ subunits. The sequence of events is as follows: Upon binding a neurotransmitter, the GPCR catalyzes the exchange of Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) for Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) on the $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit. This causes the $G_{\\alpha s}$-GTP complex to dissociate from the receptor and the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer. The free $G_{\\alpha s}$-GTP complex then binds to and activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. The signaling is terminated when the intrinsic GTPase activity of the $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit hydrolyzes GTP back to GDP, causing it to dissociate from adenylyl cyclase and re-associate with the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic disorder in a line of cultured neurons where the $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit has a loss-of-function mutation in its GTPase domain. This mutation prevents the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP but does not affect its ability to bind GTP or interact with adenylyl cyclase. If these neurons are exposed to a constant, saturating concentration of the appropriate neurotransmitter, what will be the resulting effect on the activity of adenylyl cyclase?\n\nA.

This steady state is achieved by a balance between production by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase and degradation by a Phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme. The degradation rate of cAMP by PDE can be accurately modeled as a first-order process, with the rate of degradation being directly proportional to the cAMP concentration.\n\nThe researchers investigate two types of neurons. The wild-type (WT) neuron expresses the D2 dopamine receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that normally couples to the inhibitory G-protein, $G_{\\alpha i}$.

In these neurons, a splice variant of the D2 receptor is expressed, which causes it to preferentially couple to the stimulatory G-protein, $G_{\\alpha s}$, instead of $G_{\\alpha i}$. When these mutant neurons are stimulated with a saturating concentration of dopamine, the activated $G_{\\alpha s}$ proteins cause the adenylyl cyclase production rate to increase to a new, constant rate that is $18.4$ times its basal rate.\n\nAssuming the PDE degradation kinetics are identical in both WT and mutant neurons, calculate the new steady-state concentration of cAMP in a mutant neuron after the application of a saturating concentration of dopamine.
