This thought experiment models situations found in both genetic diseases and modern experimental designs, providing a solid foundation for understanding the entire cycle.

This specific mutation locks the receptor into a conformation that is typically only achieved upon binding its extracellular ligand. As a result, the receptor is constitutively active, meaning it signals continuously, even in the complete absence of its ligand. This mutant GPCR is known to couple to a standard heterotrimeric G-protein, which consists of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits.\n\nGiven this scenario, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected predominant state of the associated heterotrimeric G-protein population within these engineered cells?\n\nA.

This exercise moves from abstract diagrams to concrete experimental evidence by introducing Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a powerful technique for monitoring protein interactions in living cells.

To visualize the activity of a specific heterotrimeric G-protein, they have genetically engineered the neuron to express modified subunits. The Gα subunit is C-terminally fused to Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP), and the Gγ subunit of the Gβγ complex is C-terminally fused to Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP).\n\nThis system is designed to report on the G-protein's activation state using Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a mechanism describing energy transfer between two light-sensitive molecules. In this setup, CFP acts as the \"donor\" fluorophore and YFP acts as the \"acceptor\" fluorophore. FRET is highly efficient when the donor and acceptor are in very close proximity (typically less than 10 nanometers), but its efficiency drops off sharply with increasing distance. The experiment is monitored by exciting the CFP with a laser and measuring the emission intensities from both CFP and YFP. The FRET signal is quantified as the ratio of acceptor emission to donor emission (YFP Intensity / CFP Intensity).\n\nAt time $t = 0$, a saturating concentration of a specific agonist is rapidly perfused over the neuron. This agonist binds to a G-protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) that is endogenously expressed by the neuron and known to couple to the engineered G-protein.\n\nAssuming the G-protein cycle proceeds as expected upon receptor activation, which of the following best describes the change in the measured FRET ratio (YFP Intensity / CFP Intensity) immediately following the application of the agonist at $t=0$?\n\nA. A rapid and sustained increase in the FRET ratio.\n\nB. A rapid and sustained decrease in the FRET ratio.\n\nC. No significant change in the FRET ratio.\n\nD. A slow, gradual increase in the FRET ratio over the course of several minutes.\n\nE.

The FRET efficiency $E$ between donor and acceptor separated by distance $r$ is given by\n$$\nE=\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{r}{R_{0}}\\right)^{6}}=\\frac{R_{0}^{6}}{R_{0}^{6}+r^{6}},\n$$\nwhere $R_{0}$ is the Förster radius determined by donor-acceptor properties, with\n$$\nR_{0}^{6}=\\frac{9000(\\ln 10)\\kappa^{2}Q_{D}J}{128\\pi^{5}n^{4}N_{A}},\n$$\nand $\\kappa^{2}$ is the dipole orientation factor, $Q_{D}$ is the donor quantum yield, $J$ is the spectral overlap integral, $n$ is the refractive index, and $N_{A}$ is Avogadro’s number.\n\nIn sensitized emission FRET measurements under donor excitation, the acceptor emission intensity $I_{\\text{YFP}}$ scales with $E$ (more energy transferred yields more acceptor emission), and the donor emission intensity $I_{\\text{CFP}}$ scales with $(1-E)$ (less donor emission when transfer occurs). Thus, the measured FRET ratio\n$$\nR=\\frac{I_{\\text{YFP}}}{I_{\\text{CFP}}}\n$$\nincreases monotonically with $E$ and, to first approximation, satisfies\n$$\nR \\propto \\frac{E}{1-E}.\n$$\n\nBefore receptor activation, the engineered heterotrimeric G protein resides predominantly in the inactive heterotrimer state $G\\alpha\\text{-CFP}\\cdot\\text{GDP}\\cdot G\\beta\\gamma\\text{-YFP}$, where CFP (on $G\\alpha$) and YFP (on $G\\gamma$ within $G\\beta\\gamma$) are held in close proximity.

In either case, the immediate effect is a decrease in $E$ because $E$ decreases sharply with increasing $r$ via the $r^{-6}$ dependence, and $R_{0}$ does not increase upon activation. Since $R \\propto E/(1-E)$, a decrease in $E$ produces a decrease in the FRET ratio $R=\\text{YFP}/\\text{CFP}$.\n\nThe time scale of receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange and subunit dissociation is rapid (milliseconds to seconds), so the decrease in $R$ is rapid upon agonist application. Under saturating agonist, the activated fraction of G proteins remains elevated due to continuous receptor-driven exchange, so the reduction in $E$ and thus in $R$ is sustained relative to baseline, rather than showing an immediate return to baseline. Any recovery would depend on GTP hydrolysis and system-specific desensitization kinetics, which do not cause an immediate return under continued saturation.\n\nTherefore, the measured FRET ratio (YFP Intensity / CFP Intensity) will show a rapid and sustained decrease immediately following agonist application.\n\nThe best choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2352769"}, {"introduction": "A defining characteristic of G-protein signaling is its capacity for tremendous signal amplification.
