Their activation is controlled by a specialized region within the protein called the voltage sensor domain. In a typical voltage-gated sodium channel, each of the four homologous domains contains a transmembrane segment known as S4, which is rich in positively charged amino acids (e.g., Arginine, Lysine). The movement of these S4 segments in response to changes in the membrane electric field leads to the opening of the channel's pore.\n\nThe sensitivity of a channel to voltage is often characterized by its voltage-activation curve, which plots the probability of channel opening as a function of membrane potential. A key parameter from this curve is the half-activation potential, denoted as $V_{1/2}$, which is the membrane potential at which 50% of the channels are in the open state.\n\nConsider a wild-type (WT) voltage-gated sodium channel with a half-activation potential $V_{1/2, \\text{WT}}$.
