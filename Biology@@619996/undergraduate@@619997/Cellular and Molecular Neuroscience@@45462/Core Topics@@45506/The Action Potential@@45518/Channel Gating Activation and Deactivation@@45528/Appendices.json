The membrane patch is initially held at a hyperpolarized resting potential, $V_{rest}$, where the channel is predominantly in a non-conducting state. The experimental protocol consists of the following voltage-clamp steps:\n1. The membrane potential is rapidly stepped from $V_{rest}$ to a depolarized potential, $V_{depolarized}$, and held at this level for a duration $T$.\n2. After time $T$, the potential is stepped back to $V_{rest}$.\n\nDuring the experiment, the recorded current trace shows the following sequence of events:\n- At the beginning, while the potential is at $V_{rest}$, the current is at a baseline level, which we define as zero current.\n- Immediately after the step to $V_{depolarized}$, a brief, discrete pulse of inward current is observed.\n- Following this current pulse, the recording returns to the zero-current baseline and remains there for the rest of the duration $T$, even though the membrane potential is still held at $V_{depolarized}$.\n- When the potential is returned to $V_{rest}$, the current remains at the zero-current baseline.\n\nThe period of zero current that occurs *after* the current pulse but *before* the potential is returned to $V_{rest}$ corresponds to a specific conformational state of the channel.

A sub-conductance state", "solution": "We model a single voltage-gated channel with three key conformational states: closed (resting) $C$, open $O$, and inactivated $I$. Under voltage clamp, the single-channel current is\n$$\ni(t)=\\begin{cases}\ng\\,(V(t)-E_{\\text{rev}}), & \\text{if in } O,\\\\\n0, & \\text{if in } C \\text{ or } I,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $g$ is the single-channel conductance and $E_{\\text{rev}}$ is the reversal potential of the permeant cation. The observed inward current upon depolarization is consistent with $V_{\\text{depolarized}}-E_{\\text{rev}}<0$.\n\nThe kinetics at a fixed voltage $V$ can be represented by a Markov scheme with voltage-dependent transition rates:\n$$\nC \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{OC}(V)]{k_{CO}(V)} O \\xrightarrow{k_{OI}(V)} I,\\quad I \\xrightarrow{k_{IC}(V)} C.\n$$\nAt $V_{\\text{rest}}$ (hyperpolarized), $k_{CO}(V_{\\text{rest}})$ is small, so the channel predominantly resides in $C$ and the current baseline is zero.\n\nUpon stepping to $V_{\\text{depolarized}}$, $k_{CO}(V_{\\text{depolarized}})$ increases, producing a brief opening event (discrete inward current pulse). During maintained depolarization, the transition $O \\to I$ proceeds with rate $k_{OI}(V_{\\text{depolarized}})$ that is typically large, while exit from $I$ at depolarized voltages is minimal, i.e., $k_{IC}(V_{\\text{depolarized}})\\approx 0$.

This non-conducting, refractory non-opening during maintained depolarization defines the inactivated state, not the closed (resting) state: if the channel were simply in $C$ at depolarized voltage, one would expect stochastic reopenings because $k_{CO}(V_{\\text{depolarized}})>0$.\n\nWhen the potential is stepped back to $V_{\\text{rest}}$, two facts explain the continued zero current: recovery from inactivation requires a finite time constant $\\tau_{\\text{rec}}(V_{\\text{rest}})=\\left(k_{IC}(V_{\\text{rest}})\\right)^{-1}$, and even after recovery to $C$, at $V_{\\text{rest}}$ the opening rate $k_{CO}(V_{\\text{rest}})$ is small, maintaining zero current. The closure upon repolarization is termed deactivation only if the channel is in $O$ at the moment of repolarization; here, the zero-current period in question occurs before repolarization, so it is not deactivation. A sub-conductance state would produce a nonzero, smaller-amplitude current, which contradicts the observed zero current.\n\nTherefore, the zero-current period after the brief opening during maintained depolarization corresponds to occupancy of the inactivated state.\n\nThe best choice is C.

The activation of voltage-gated channels is driven by the movement of charged segments, known as voltage sensors, within the membrane's electric field. In this practice [@problem_id:2330587], you will connect molecular biology to biophysics by predicting how a specific genetic mutation in a channel's voltage sensor alters its activation threshold and contributes to a disease state like epilepsy.", "problem": "Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels are integral membrane proteins essential for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells like neurons. The opening, or 'activation', of these channels is triggered by a depolarization of the cell membrane. This voltage-sensing capability is primarily attributed to the S4 transmembrane segment within each of the channel's four domains. The S4 segment contains a series of positively charged amino acid residues, typically arginine or lysine, at every third position. At a typical neuronal resting membrane potential of -70 mV, these positive charges are pulled inward by the strong electric field, holding the channel's activation gate closed. When the membrane depolarizes to a threshold potential, typically around -55 mV, the outward electrostatic repulsion on the S4 segment overcomes the inward pull, causing it to move outward and open the channel pore.\n\nConsider a newly discovered genetic channelopathy that causes a form of familial epilepsy, characterized by an abnormally low threshold for seizure activity. Genetic analysis reveals that affected individuals have a point mutation in the gene encoding the Nav1.2 channel subtype, which is prevalent in the central nervous system. This mutation results in the substitution of a single, highly conserved arginine residue (a positively charged amino acid) with a glutamine residue (a neutral, polar amino acid) in the S4 segment of the channel's second domain.\n\nBased on your understanding of the biophysical principles of channel gating, what is the most likely consequence of this specific mutation on the Nav1.2 channel's activation properties and the overall excitability of the neuron?\n\nA. The activation threshold becomes more negative (e.g., shifts from -55 mV to -65 mV), making the neuron hyperexcitable.\n\nB. The activation threshold becomes more positive (e.g., shifts from -55 mV to -45 mV), making the neuron hypoexcitable.\n\nC. The channel's inactivation mechanism is disabled, leading to pathologically prolonged action potentials.\n\nD. The channel's ion selectivity filter is altered, allowing potassium ions to pass through and causing a net hyperpolarization.\n\nE. The activation threshold remains unchanged, but the rate of channel opening (activation kinetics) is significantly slowed down.", "solution": "Biophysical principle: Voltage sensor movement in Nav channels is driven by the work of the membrane electric field on the net positive charges in the S4 segment. At membrane potential $V$, the free energy difference between open and closed states can be expressed as\n$$\n\\Delta G(V) = \\Delta G_{0} - z F V,\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{0}$ is the intrinsic free energy difference at $V=0$, $z$ is the effective gating charge associated with the S4 movement, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. The open probability then follows a Boltzmann relation:\n$$\nP_{\\text{open}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{k_{B} T}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - z F V}{k_{B} T}\\right)}.\n$$\nAt typical resting potentials ($V<0$), the term $-z F V$ is positive, stabilizing the closed state and keeping $P_{\\text{open}}$ low. Depolarization (increasing $V$) reduces $\\Delta G(V)$ and increases $P_{\\text{open}}$.\n\nEffect of the mutation: Substituting an arginine (positively charged) with glutamine (neutral) in S4 reduces the number of positive charges that sense voltage, thereby reducing the effective gating charge from $z$ to $z'$, with $z' < z$. For a given subthreshold $V<0$, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor,\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - z F V}{k_{B} T},\n$$\ndecreases when $z$ is reduced, because $-z F V$ is positive at negative $V$ and becomes smaller in magnitude with smaller $z$. Consequently, $P_{\\text{open}}(V)$ increases at the same negative potential. This means that channels will begin to open at more negative voltages, i.e., the activation curve is shifted leftward to more negative potentials and the activation threshold becomes more negative.\n\nEquivalently, the midpoint of activation $V_{1/2}$ defined by $\\Delta G(V_{1/2}) = 0$ shifts to more negative potentials when the resting-state electrostatic stabilization by the S4 charges is reduced; neutralizing a conserved S4 arginine diminishes the inward stabilizing force at rest and favors outward displacement of S4 at lower depolarizations. The dominant physiological effect is a lower voltage threshold for channel opening.\n\nPhysiological consequence: A more negative activation threshold increases the probability of Nav1.2 channels opening during small depolarizations, thereby enhancing the likelihood of action potential initiation and increasing neuronal excitability. This aligns with the phenotype of familial epilepsy with a lowered seizure threshold.\n\nExclusion of alternatives:\n- A more positive activation threshold (option B) would require increased depolarization and would reduce excitability, inconsistent with the clinical picture and with the effect of reducing S4 positive charge.\n- Disabling inactivation (option C) involves the DIII–DIV linker and the IFM motif, not S4 charge; S4 mutations primarily alter activation gating and voltage dependence.\n- Altered ion selectivity (option D) arises from mutations in the pore loop between S5 and S6, not the S4 voltage sensor.\n- Purely slowed activation kinetics without a shift in threshold (option E) does not capture the primary effect of losing S4 positive charge, which primarily shifts activation to more negative voltages; while kinetics can be modulated, the key effect is a leftward shift and increased excitability.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is a negative shift in activation threshold and neuronal hyperexcitability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2330587"}, {"introduction": "While observing a single channel is insightful, understanding neuronal signaling often requires modeling the collective behavior of thousands of channels.
