This exercise challenges you to think like an experimental neurophysiologist to distinguish between active, regenerative signal propagation and simple passive electrical spread. By predicting the outcome of a targeted pharmacological block, you will solidify your understanding of the molecular machinery—specifically voltage-gated sodium channels—that allows a backpropagating action potential to actively journey through the dendrites [@problem_id:2328213].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the properties of a large pyramidal neuron. They place one microelectrode in the soma to record voltage and a second microelectrode on a distal dendrite. Upon stimulating the neuron to fire a single Action Potential (AP), they observe a full-sized AP at the soma and a smaller, but clearly defined, AP at the distal dendrite. To test the hypothesis that the dendritic AP is due to active propagation, the researcher locally applies Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a potent blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels, to the entire dendritic tree while ensuring none of it reaches the soma or axon. They then stimulate the neuron to fire another single AP from the soma. Which of the following outcomes is expected in the recordings from the soma and the distal dendrite after the application of TTX?\n\nA. The AP is eliminated at both the soma and the dendrite.\n\nB.

The somatic AP is eliminated, but the dendritic AP is unaffected.", "solution": "1) Initial observation: A full-sized action potential (AP) at the soma and a smaller, clearly defined AP at a distal dendrite indicates that the somatic AP backpropagates into the dendritic tree. The presence of a distinct spike at the dendrite suggests active dendritic conductances, primarily voltage-gated sodium channels, that locally regenerate the depolarization. In active backpropagation, local inward sodium current supports an all-or-none or spike-like event beyond what passive spread alone would produce.\n\n2) Intervention: Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is locally applied to the entire dendritic tree, blocking dendritic voltage-gated sodium channels, while none reaches the soma or axon. TTX abolishes the regenerative sodium current in the dendrites, converting the dendritic membrane from active to effectively passive with respect to sodium-mediated spike generation.\n\n3) Somatic and axonal excitability: Because TTX does not reach the soma or axon initial segment, the AP initiation machinery remains intact. The somatic AP is therefore expected to be unaffected. The AP is initiated in the axon initial segment and invades the soma normally, producing a full-sized somatic spike.\n\n4) Consequence for dendritic signal: With dendritic sodium channels blocked, there is no local regenerative depolarization in the dendrite. The signal reaching the distal dendrite arises from passive electrotonic spread of voltage from the soma. In passive cable theory, a transient somatic voltage change $V(0,t)$ produces at distance $x$ a response that is attenuated and temporally filtered. For a passive, uniform cable, the steady-state attenuation follows\n$$\nV(x) = V(0)\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the length constant determined by membrane and axial resistances. For transients, the response is additionally broadened by the membrane time constant $\\tau$, so the distal waveform is smaller in amplitude and slower, lacking the fast upstroke characteristic of an AP.\n\n5) Nonzero passive signal: Although active regeneration is eliminated, axial currents from the soma during the somatic AP still flow into the dendrite, so the distal dendrite will not be electrically silent. Instead, it will exhibit a small, smooth, subthreshold depolarization reflecting passive spread:\n$$\nV_{\\text{dend}}(x,t) \\approx \\left[\\text{filtered } V_{\\text{soma}}(t)\\right]\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right),\n$$\nwith no all-or-none spike. Therefore, the dendritic recording is not a flat line but a greatly reduced, passive potential.\n\n6) Option evaluation:\n- A is false: the soma and axon are not exposed to TTX, so the somatic AP persists.\n- B is false: passive electrotonic spread ensures a small depolarization at the distal dendrite; it is not absent.\n- C is true: the somatic AP is unaffected; the dendritic signal becomes small and passive.\n- D is false: dendritic APs are affected by dendritic TTX.\n- E is false: the soma cannot be eliminated when TTX is only dendritic, and the dendrite cannot remain spiking without sodium channels.\n\nConclusion: The expected outcome is that the somatic AP is unaffected, but the dendritic recording shows a greatly reduced, passive potential.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2328213"}, {"introduction": "The strength and reach of a backpropagating action potential (bAP) are not fixed; they are dynamically regulated. This practice explores how dendritic excitability is tuned, focusing on the role of A-type potassium channels which act as crucial \"brakes\" on depolarization. Understanding this concept reveals that the bAP's journey is a delicate balance between inward currents that amplify the signal and outward currents that curtail it [@problem_id:2328232].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the properties of pyramidal neurons from the cortex. These neurons are known to generate action potentials at the axon hillock which then not only propagate down the axon but also travel backward into the neuron's dendritic tree. This phenomenon is known as a backpropagating action potential (bAP). The amplitude of a bAP typically decreases as it travels away from the soma into the distal dendrites.\n\nThe dendritic membranes of these pyramidal neurons possess a significant density of A-type potassium channels. These are voltage-gated channels that open in response to membrane depolarization, but they inactivate very quickly. Their primary function is to cause a rapid, transient outflow of potassium ions, which helps repolarize the membrane and thereby dampens dendritic excitability.\n\nThe scientist adds the pharmacological agent 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to the extracellular solution bathing the neuron. 4-AP is a well-known and specific blocker of A-type potassium channels. The scientist then stimulates the neuron to fire an action potential and measures the properties of the resulting bAP in a distal dendrite.\n\nBased on the known function of A-type potassium channels, which of the following outcomes is the most likely effect of applying 4-AP on the bAP measured in the distal dendrite?\n\nA. The bAP amplitude will decrease, and its propagation into the dendrite will be less extensive.\n\nB. The bAP amplitude will increase, and its propagation into the dendrite will be more extensive.\n\nC. The bAP amplitude will remain unchanged, but its propagation into the dendrite will be more extensive.\n\nD. The bAP amplitude will increase, but its propagation into the dendrite will be less extensive.\n\nE. The bAP will be completely eliminated and not reach the distal dendrite.", "solution": "We analyze how blocking A-type potassium channels with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) affects a backpropagating action potential (bAP) in distal dendrites by applying membrane and cable theory, along with the known gating behavior of these channels.\n\nFirst, represent the membrane current balance during a bAP in a dendritic segment as\n$$\nC_{m}\\frac{dV}{dt} \\;=\\; -g_{L}\\left(V-E_{L}\\right) \\;-\\; I_{A} \\;+\\; I_{\\text{axial}} \\;-\\; \\sum I_{\\text{other}},\n$$\nwhere $C_{m}$ is the membrane capacitance, $g_{L}$ is the leak conductance, $E_{L}$ is the leak reversal potential, $I_{\\text{axial}}$ is the axial current from neighboring compartments (the drive for the bAP), and $I_{A}$ is the transient A-type potassium current. The A-type current is\n$$\nI_{A} \\;=\\; g_{A}\\,m^{p}h^{q}\\,\\left(V-E_{K}\\right),\n$$\nwith $g_{A}$ the maximal A-type conductance, $m$ and $h$ the activation and inactivation variables, $p,q$ positive integers, and $E_{K}$ the potassium reversal potential. Because $E_{K}$ is typically more negative than $V$ during depolarization, $I_{A}$ is an outward current that opposes depolarization and speeds repolarization.\n\nApplying 4-AP blocks A-type channels, which we model as $g_{A}\\to 0$. This removes $I_{A}$ from the right-hand side, thereby reducing the total outward conductance during the bAP. Two immediate consequences follow.\n\nEffect on local bAP amplitude: For a given axial input $I_{\\text{axial}}$ during the spike upstroke, the instantaneous depolarization is limited by the total membrane conductance $g_{\\text{tot}}$, where\n$$\ng_{\\text{tot}} \\;=\\; g_{L} \\;+\\; g_{A} \\;+\\; \\cdots.\n$$\nIn a quasi-steady approximation, the local voltage change satisfies $\\Delta V \\approx I_{\\text{axial}}/g_{\\text{tot}}$. Blocking A-type channels decreases $g_{\\text{tot}}$ (since $g_{A}\\to 0$), which increases $\\Delta V$. Equivalently, with less outward $K^{+}$ current opposing the upstroke, the peak depolarization achieved by the bAP is larger. Thus, the bAP amplitude increases.\n\nEffect on propagation into distal dendrites: In cable theory, passive voltage attenuation with distance $x$ follows\n$$\nV(x) \\;=\\; V(0)\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right),\n$$\nwhere the length constant is\n$$\n\\lambda \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}}.\n$$\nHere $r_{m}$ is the membrane resistance per unit length and $r_{i}$ is the axial (internal) resistance per unit length. Since $r_{m} = 1/g_{\\text{tot}}$ per unit area (up to geometry factors), reducing $g_{\\text{tot}}$ by blocking $g_{A}$ increases $r_{m}$ and therefore increases $\\lambda$. An increased $\\lambda$ reduces the rate of spatial decay, so $V(x)$ decays less with distance; i.e., propagation is more extensive into distal dendrites. In addition, removing the fast repolarizing A-type current broadens the spike and can facilitate regenerative activation of voltage-gated sodium channels further along the dendrite, further promoting propagation.\n\nCombining these effects, blocking A-type channels with 4-AP leads to a larger bAP amplitude and more extensive propagation into the dendritic tree.\n\nEvaluating the options, the outcome corresponds to an increased amplitude and more extensive propagation, which matches option B. All other options contradict the effects of reducing the repolarizing, shunting A-type conductance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2328232"}, {"introduction": "This final practice bridges biophysical principles with a fundamental neuronal function: synaptic plasticity.

A key process is the induction of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting enhancement in signal transmission between two neurons. In many cases, LTP induction requires a significant postsynaptic depolarization to coincide with presynaptic neurotransmitter release. This depolarization can be provided by an action potential that propagates from the cell body back into the dendritic tree, an event known as a backpropagating action potential (bAP).\n\nIn this model, the dendrite is treated as a passive electrical cable. The peak depolarization of a single bAP, relative to the resting membrane potential, attenuates as it travels a distance $x$ from the soma according to the equation:\n$$V_{peak,1}(x) = V_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nWhen a high-frequency burst of bAPs occurs, the resulting depolarization at a synapse is the sum of the individual contributions.
