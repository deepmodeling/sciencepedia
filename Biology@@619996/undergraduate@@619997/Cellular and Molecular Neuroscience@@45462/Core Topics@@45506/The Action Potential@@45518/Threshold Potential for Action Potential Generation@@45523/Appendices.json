This thought experiment explores the phenomenon of \"accommodation,\" where a neuron fails to fire an action potential in response to a slow, gradual depolarization, even when the membrane potential exceeds the threshold determined by a rapid stimulus. This practice will challenge you to think critically about the underlying biophysics, specifically how the different activation and inactivation speeds of voltage-gated ion channels make the firing threshold dependent on the *rate* of depolarization. [@problem_id:2354051]", "problem": "An electrophysiologist is investigating the firing properties of a single, isolated neuron. The neuron has a stable resting membrane potential of -70 mV. Two experiments are conducted.\n\nIn Experiment 1, a brief, square-wave pulse of depolarizing current is injected into the neuron. It is found that the minimum current pulse required to elicit a single action potential is one that brings the membrane potential rapidly to -55 mV. This value is thus recorded as the neuron's \"threshold potential\".\n\nIn Experiment 2, a different type of current is injected. This time, the current increases very slowly and linearly (a \"current ramp\"), causing the neuron's membrane potential to depolarize gradually over hundreds of milliseconds. The physiologist observes that the membrane potential slowly rises, crosses the previously determined threshold of -55 mV, and continues to rise to a peak of -48 mV, but no action potential is generated. The neuron has failed to fire, a phenomenon known as accommodation.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate biophysical explanation for the neuron's failure to fire an action potential in Experiment 2, despite the membrane potential exceeding the threshold value determined in Experiment 1?\n\nA. The slow depolarization causes the voltage-gated sodium channels to deactivate more quickly than they can activate, preventing the necessary net inward current.\n\nB. The $Na^+/K^+$ pump hyperactivates during the slow ramp, pumping out positive charge faster than the depolarizing current can inject it, thus clamping the membrane potential.\n\nC. This observation is a paradox with no known explanation, as any depolarization beyond a fixed threshold potential must, by definition, trigger an action potential.\n\nD. The slow rate of depolarization provides sufficient time for a significant fraction of voltage-gated sodium channels to enter an inactivated state, while also allowing slow-acting, voltage-gated potassium channels to open and increase outward current.\n\nE. The prolonged subthreshold depolarization causes a significant influx of chloride ions (Cl-), whose negative charge hyperpolarizes the membrane and cancels out the effect of the injected depolarizing current.", "solution": "We interpret the brief-pulse threshold in Experiment 1 as a dynamic threshold defined under a rapid depolarization. In a conductance-based framework (e.g., Hodgkin–Huxley), the total membrane current is the sum of sodium, potassium, and leak currents,\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{tot}} = I_{\\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\\mathrm{K}} + I_{\\mathrm{L}},\n$$\nwith\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\bar g_{\\mathrm{Na}} m^{3} h \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\right), \\quad\nI_{\\mathrm{K}} = \\bar g_{\\mathrm{K}} n^{4} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right), \\quad\nI_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\bar g_{\\mathrm{L}} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right).\n$$\nThe gating variables obey first-order kinetics,\n$$\n\\tau_{m}(V)\\,\\dot m = m_{\\infty}(V) - m, \\quad\n\\tau_{h}(V)\\,\\dot h = h_{\\infty}(V) - h, \\quad\n\\tau_{n}(V)\\,\\dot n = n_{\\infty}(V) - n.\n$$\nUnder a fast depolarizing step, $m$ (activation) rises rapidly because $\\tau_{m}$ is small, while $h$ (inactivation) and $n$ (potassium activation) change more slowly because $\\tau_{h}$ and $\\tau_{n}$ are larger. This allows a large transient increase in $m^{3}h$ and hence in $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, producing the positive feedback necessary for an action potential once $V$ crosses the dynamic threshold observed in Experiment 1.\n\nIn contrast, during a slow ramp depolarization, the membrane potential changes over hundreds of milliseconds. This provides enough time for $h$ to decrease toward $h_{\\infty}(V)$ (sodium channel inactivation) and for $n$ to increase toward $n_{\\infty}(V)$ (potassium channel activation). Consequently, even as $V$ crosses the threshold measured under fast conditions, the effective sodium availability $m^{3}h$ is reduced by the decreased $h$, and the outward potassium conductance $\\bar g_{\\mathrm{K}} n^{4}$ is increased. The net effect is that the inward sodium current fails to exceed the outward currents; the positive feedback required for spike initiation is suppressed, and the neuron accommodates, failing to fire despite surpassing the fast-step threshold. This corresponds exactly to statement D.\n\nBy contrast:\n- Statement A is inaccurate in mechanism and terminology: during depolarization, sodium channels activate (increase $m$) and inactivate (decrease $h$); “deactivation” refers to closing upon repolarization, not outpacing activation during depolarization.\n- Statement B is incorrect because the $Na^+/K^+$ pump operates on much slower timescales and contributes a relatively small electrogenic current insufficient to clamp the membrane during a brief ramp.\n- Statement C is false; threshold is not a fixed voltage but depends on rate of depolarization and channel state, hence dynamic threshold and accommodation are well-established.\n- Statement E is implausible in current-clamp with standard chloride conditions; chloride conductance is not the dominant determinant here and would not generally produce the observed accommodation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate biophysical explanation is that slow depolarization permits sodium channel inactivation and potassium channel activation to develop sufficiently to prevent net inward current and spike initiation, i.e., option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2354051"}, {"introduction": "A neuron's excitability is not set in stone; it is constantly fine-tuned by a variety of modulatory influences.
