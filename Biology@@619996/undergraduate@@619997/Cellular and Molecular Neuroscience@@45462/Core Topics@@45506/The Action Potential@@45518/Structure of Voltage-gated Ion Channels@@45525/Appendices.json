This sensing capability is primarily attributed to the S4 transmembrane segment, which contains a series of positively charged amino acid residues, typically arginine or lysine, at every third position. The movement of these charges in response to an electric field change constitutes the \"gating current,\" and the total charge that moves across the membrane's electric field during channel activation is known as the total gating charge, $Q_{total}$.\n\nConsider a hypothetical wild-type voltage-gated sodium channel whose total gating charge is measured to be $Q_{total} = 13.6e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. A site-directed mutagenesis experiment is performed where the second arginine residue (R2) in the S4 segment is replaced by a neutral glutamine residue.

The \"ball-and-chain\" model provides a vivid physical explanation for this phenomenon, where a tethered intracellular domain plugs the open pore from the inside. This exercise [@problem_id:2351502] is a thought experiment that challenges you to apply this model, predicting how changing the physical properties and flexibility of the \"chain\" will impact the rate of inactivation, deepening your intuition for structure-function relationships in proteins.", "problem": "Voltage-gated potassium ($\\text{K}^+$) channels are crucial for repolarizing the membrane potential in neurons and other excitable cells. A well-studied example is the Shaker $\\text{K}^+$ channel, which exhibits a phenomenon known as N-type or \"fast\" inactivation. This process is governed by the channel's N-terminal intracellular domain. The \"ball-and-chain\" model provides a physical basis for this inactivation: after the channel opens in response to membrane depolarization, a globular part of the N-terminus (the \"ball\") diffuses and physically occludes the inner mouth of the channel's pore. This \"ball\" is tethered to the main body of the channel by a flexible polypeptide segment (the \"chain\").\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a series of five consecutive proline residues are genetically inserted into the middle of the \"chain\" segment of the Shaker $\\text{K}^+$ channel's N-terminus. Proline is an amino acid that, due to its unique cyclic structure, severely restricts the conformational flexibility of a polypeptide backbone, introducing a rigid kink.\n\nBased on the ball-and-chain model, what is the most likely effect of this proline insertion on the inactivation properties of the Shaker $\\text{K}^+$ channel, compared to the normal, unmutated channel?\n\nA. The rate of inactivation will be significantly faster.\n\nB. The rate of inactivation will be significantly slower.\n\nC.

The voltage-dependence of channel opening will be shifted to more negative potentials, but the rate of inactivation will be unaffected.", "solution": "In the ball-and-chain model, N-type inactivation occurs when the tethered N-terminal “ball” reaches and occludes the inner pore after channel opening. The observable inactivation rate is controlled by two coupled processes: (i) the diffusional search of the tethered ball and (ii) its ability to adopt conformations that place the ball at the pore. A convenient kinetic representation is that the inactivation rate constant is proportional to the probability of productive contact multiplied by a microscopic attempt rate, which itself is diffusion-limited:\n$$\nk_{\\text{inact}} \\sim k_{0}\\,P_{\\text{contact}}, \\quad k_{0} \\propto D_{\\text{eff}},\n$$\nwith $D_{\\text{eff}}$ the effective diffusivity of the tethered ball. Equivalently, in transition-state language,\n$$\nk_{\\text{inact}} = \\nu\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{k_{B}T}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\nu$ is a prefactor reflecting diffusional dynamics and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ is the free-energy cost to bring the ball into the occluding configuration, dominated by entropic and bending penalties of the tether.\n\nPolymer-physics descriptions of the N-terminus as a worm-like chain imply that the conformational statistics, contact probability, and search dynamics depend on the persistence length $l_{p}$ (or Kuhn length $b=2l_{p}$). Inserting five consecutive prolines introduces a rigid kink and increases local stiffness, effectively increasing $l_{p}$ and decreasing chain flexibility. The consequences are:\n- The conformational entropy available to place the ball at the pore is reduced, increasing the entropic component of $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, so $P_{\\text{contact}} \\propto \\exp(-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}/(k_{B}T))$ decreases.\n- The effective diffusivity $D_{\\text{eff}}$ of the tethered end on its conformational manifold is reduced by increased stiffness and constraints, lowering the prefactor $k_{0}$.\n\nBoth effects decrease $k_{\\text{inact}}$ and increase the mean first-passage time $\\tau_{\\text{MFPT}}$ for pore encounter, with $k_{\\text{inact}} \\sim \\tau_{\\text{MFPT}}^{-1}$. Therefore, the inactivation becomes significantly slower. Complete elimination of inactivation generally requires removal of the ball or disruption of its ability to bind; merely rigidifying the chain typically slows and may reduce the extent of inactivation but does not abolish it. The voltage dependence of activation is governed primarily by the S4 voltage-sensor domains rather than the N-terminus, so a pure shift in activation without inactivation changes is unlikely.\n\nHence, relative to the unmutated channel, the most likely effect is a significant slowing of inactivation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2351502"}, {"introduction": "The opening and closing of an ion channel is a thermodynamic process, where the channel favors the conformation with the lowest free energy.
