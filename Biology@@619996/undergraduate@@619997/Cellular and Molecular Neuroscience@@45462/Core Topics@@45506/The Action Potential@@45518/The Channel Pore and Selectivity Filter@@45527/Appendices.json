Their remarkable ability to selectively conduct K+ ions at a high rate, while excluding smaller sodium (Na+) ions, is attributed to a narrow region of the channel pore known as the selectivity filter. This filter is formed by a highly conserved amino acid sequence motif, Glycine-Tyrosine-Glycine (GYG). The backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of this motif line the pore, creating a series of binding sites with a precise diameter. This arrangement is energetically optimized to coordinate a dehydrated K+ ion (ionic radius ~1.38 Å), perfectly mimicking its shell of water molecules. For a dehydrated Na+ ion (ionic radius ~1.02 Å), the pore is too wide for optimal coordination, meaning the large energetic cost of shedding its own water shell is not sufficiently compensated. Thus, Na+ is effectively excluded.\n\nImagine a molecular biologist introduces a point mutation in the gene for a K+ channel, changing the selectivity filter motif from GYG to GFG (Glycine-Phenylalanine-Glycine). Phenylalanine (F) is structurally similar to Tyrosine (Y), as both possess an aromatic ring; however, Phenylalanine lacks the hydroxyl (-OH) group present on Tyrosine's ring.\n\nBased on your understanding of the structure and function of the selectivity filter, what is the most likely consequence of this GYG to GFG mutation on the channel's ion selectivity?\n\nA. The channel will become more selective for Na+ ions over K+ ions.\n\nB. The channel will lose its high selectivity and allow both Na+ and K+ ions to pass through.\n\nC. The channel will become completely non-conductive and impermeable to both Na+ and K+ ions.\n\nD. The selectivity of the channel for K+ over Na+ will remain unchanged because both Tyrosine and Phenylalanine are bulky aromatic amino acids.", "solution": "Ion selectivity in K^{+} channels arises from the balance of dehydration cost and compensating coordination within the selectivity filter. For an ion $i \\in \\{\\text{K}^{+}, \\text{Na}^{+}\\}$, the free energy to traverse the filter can be represented schematically as\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{perm}}^{(i)}=\\Delta G_{\\text{dehyd}}^{(i)}+\\Delta G_{\\text{coord}}^{(i)}+\\Delta G_{\\text{elec}}^{(i)}+\\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(i)},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\text{dehyd}}^{(i)}$ is the cost of shedding waters of hydration, and $\\Delta G_{\\text{coord}}^{(i)}$ is the compensating stabilization from carbonyl coordination in the filter. In the wild-type GYG motif, the backbone carbonyl oxygens form binding sites with geometry and spacing that closely match dehydrated $\\text{K}^{+}$, so that $|\\Delta G_{\\text{coord}}^{(\\text{K}^{+})}|$ closely offsets $\\Delta G_{\\text{dehyd}}^{(\\text{K}^{+})}$, yielding a low barrier. For $\\text{Na}^{+}$ with $r_{\\text{Na}^{+}}<r_{\\text{K}^{+}}$, the filter is too wide, and $\\Delta G_{\\text{coord}}^{(\\text{Na}^{+})}$ fails to compensate $\\Delta G_{\\text{dehyd}}^{(\\text{Na}^{+})}$, producing a higher barrier.\n\nThe tyrosine side chain in GYG contributes via its hydroxyl group to a hydrogen-bond network that stabilizes the precise alignment and rigidity of the filter carbonyls and provides local polar interactions that help set the electrostatic environment. Replacing tyrosine with phenylalanine (GYG to GFG) removes the hydroxyl group while retaining bulk. This eliminates specific hydrogen bonds and local polarity while preserving general steric volume, which is expected to:\n- reduce the rigidity and optimal positioning of the carbonyl oxygens, decreasing the magnitude of $\\Delta G_{\\text{coord}}^{(\\text{K}^{+})}$ in absolute value (less favorable K^{+} coordination),\n- alter the local electrostatics so that the strong compensation uniquely favoring K^{+} is weakened,\n- allow greater fluctuations or partial hydration within the filter, which can lower the effective dehydration penalty for $\\text{Na}^{+}$ relative to the wild type.\n\nDefine the selectivity free-energy difference\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G \\equiv \\Delta G_{\\text{perm}}^{(\\text{Na}^{+})}-\\Delta G_{\\text{perm}}^{(\\text{K}^{+})}.\n$$\nHigh K^{+} selectivity corresponds to $\\Delta \\Delta G \\gg 0$. The mutation removing the hydroxyl is expected to decrease $\\Delta \\Delta G$ toward zero by raising $\\Delta G_{\\text{perm}}^{(\\text{K}^{+})}$ and lowering $\\Delta G_{\\text{perm}}^{(\\text{Na}^{+})}$ relative to wild type. The relative permeability ratio satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{P_{\\text{K}}}{P_{\\text{Na}}}\\approx \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta \\Delta G}{k_{B}T}\\right).\n$$\nDriving $\\Delta \\Delta G$ toward $0$ drives $P_{\\text{K}}/P_{\\text{Na}}$ toward $1$, signifying loss of high selectivity and increased passage of both ions. This does not invert selectivity in favor of $\\text{Na}^{+}$, because the pore geometry still better matches $\\text{K}^{+}$ than $\\text{Na}^{+}$; nor does it render the channel non-conductive, because the backbone carbonyl cage remains intact. The change also cannot leave selectivity unchanged, because the hydroxyl provides specific polar and hydrogen-bonding interactions absent in phenylalanine.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is a loss of high selectivity, allowing both $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\\text{K}^{+}$ to pass.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2352590"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the importance of individual amino acids, we now zoom out to consider the selectivity filter as a modular functional unit. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2352617] mirrors classic molecular biology studies where entire protein domains are swapped to pinpoint their function. By predicting the outcome of transplanting a sodium channel's filter into a potassium channel's scaffold, you will reinforce your understanding of the P-loop as the primary and transferable determinant of ion selectivity.", "problem": "A team of molecular neurobiologists is investigating the structural basis of ion selectivity in voltage-gated channels. They start with a well-characterized wild-type voltage-gated potassium channel, hereafter referred to as `K_channel_WT`. This channel is known to be highly selective for potassium ions ($K^{+}$) over sodium ions ($Na^{+}$), with a permeability ratio $P_K / P_{Na}$ that is typically greater than 100. The established mechanism for this selectivity involves the channel's \"selectivity filter,\" a narrow region lined by carbonyl oxygen atoms that are perfectly spaced to coordinate a dehydrated $K^{+}$ ion (ionic radius ~1.38 Å), thereby compensating for the energetic cost of stripping away its hydration shell. The smaller $Na^{+}$ ion (ionic radius ~1.02 Å) is unable to interact favorably with all the carbonyl oxygens simultaneously, making its passage energetically unfavorable.\n\nIn a key experiment, the researchers create a chimeric channel, designated `Chimera-1`, by genetically modifying the `K_channel_WT`. They replace the gene sequence encoding the P-loop, which constitutes the selectivity filter of the `K_channel_WT`, with the corresponding P-loop sequence from a canonical voltage-gated sodium channel. The sodium channel's filter is known to employ a different mechanism, featuring a wider pore containing negatively charged amino acid residues (a high-field-strength site) that selects for a partially hydrated $Na^{+}$ ion.\n\nAssuming the `Chimera-1` protein folds correctly and successfully inserts into the plasma membrane, which of the following statements most accurately predicts its functional permeability profile?\n\nA. The `Chimera-1` channel will become a non-selective cation channel, allowing both $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$ ions to pass with similar permeability ($P_{Na} / P_K \\approx 1$).\n\nB. The `Chimera-1` channel will retain its original high selectivity for $K^{+}$ ions, as the overall protein scaffold dictates ion preference.\n\nC. The `Chimera-1` channel will become selectively permeable to $Na^{+}$ ions, exhibiting a permeability ratio ($P_{Na} / P_K$) significantly greater than 1.\n\nD. The `Chimera-1` channel will be non-functional and impermeable to all cations, as the hybrid structure is inherently unstable.\n\nE. The `Chimera-1` channel will change its selectivity to favor divalent cations like $Ca^{2+}$ due to the altered electrostatic environment of the pore.", "solution": "The wild-type channel `K_channel_WT` is highly selective for $K^{+}$ due to its selectivity filter, a narrow region formed by the P-loop where backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms are precisely positioned to coordinate a dehydrated $K^{+}$. This coordination compensates the dehydration energy penalty for $K^{+}$ but not for $Na^{+}$, because the smaller $Na^{+}$ cannot simultaneously coordinate with the same geometry, resulting in a higher free energy barrier for $Na^{+}$ permeation. Thus, in `K_channel_WT`, the permeability ratio satisfies $P_{K}/P_{Na} \\gg 1$.\n\nIon selectivity in voltage-gated channels is primarily determined by the chemistry, geometry, and electrostatics of the selectivity filter encoded by the P-loop. In canonical voltage-gated sodium channels, the filter architecture (e.g., the DEKA motif in many eukaryotic Nav channels) creates a high-field-strength environment with negatively charged residues and a wider pore that stabilizes a partially hydrated $Na^{+}$ more effectively than $K^{+}$. This design reduces the dehydration penalty specifically for $Na^{+}$ and provides favorable electrostatic and steric interactions that lower the free energy barrier for $Na^{+}$ relative to $K^{+}$, yielding $P_{Na}/P_{K} \\gg 1$.\n\nIn the chimera, the researchers replace the P-loop (the selectivity filter) of the $K^{+}$ channel with that from a sodium channel. Assuming correct folding and membrane insertion as stated, the resulting pore chemistry and geometry will be governed by the sodium channel’s selectivity filter. The global protein scaffold shapes gating and overall architecture but does not override the dominant contribution of the selectivity filter to ion selectivity. Therefore, the free energy landscape within the filter becomes sodium-favoring: the partially hydrated $Na^{+}$ will be preferentially stabilized, while $K^{+}$ will not be optimally coordinated, leading to $P_{Na}/P_{K} \\gg 1$.\n\nThis prediction rules out the alternatives:\n- Nonselective conduction ($P_{Na}/P_{K} \\approx 1$) is unlikely because the transplanted P-loop imposes specific chemical selectivity rather than removing it.\n- Retention of $K^{+}$ selectivity is unlikely because the original $K^{+}$-coordinating carbonyl geometry is removed.\n- Nonfunction due to instability is contradicted by the assumption that the chimera folds correctly and inserts into the membrane.\n- Preferential $Ca^{2+}$ permeability typically requires a high-field-strength filter optimized for divalents (e.g., an EEEE-like motif as in many Cav channels), not the sodium channel filter used here, which favors monovalent $Na^{+}$.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the chimera becomes selectively permeable to $Na^{+}$ with $P_{Na}/P_{K} \\gg 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2352617"}, {"introduction": "The concepts of 'favorable coordination' and 'energetic cost' can be made precise through the language of biophysics.
