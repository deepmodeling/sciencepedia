This practice strengthens your ability to reason from mechanism to observable phenomenon.", "problem": "In a voltage-clamp experiment, a neuroscientist studies the properties of a specific type of voltage-gated potassium ($K^{+}$) channel expressed in a cell. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations of $K^{+}$ are such that for any membrane potential greater than -90 mV, there is an outward electrochemical driving force on $K^{+}$ ions.\n\nThe experiment consists of holding the cell's membrane potential at a resting value of -80 mV, where the channels are closed, and then stepping the potential to +20 mV for a duration of 100 milliseconds (ms) before returning to -80 mV. With the normal, wild-type channels, this voltage step elicits a rapidly activating outward current that also rapidly inactivates, meaning the current rises to a peak and then decays back to near zero within tens of milliseconds, even while the membrane is held at +20 mV. This type of inactivation is known as N-type or \"ball-and-chain\" inactivation, where a tethered domain on the N-terminus of the channel protein physically occludes the ion-conducting pore.\n\nThe neuroscientist then repeats the experiment on a cell expressing a mutant version of the same channel. This mutation involves a deletion of the N-terminal \"ball\" domain, but leaves the voltage-sensing domains and the pore region of the channel intact.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected current trace during the 100 ms step to +20 mV for the mutant channel, as compared to the wild-type?\n\nA. No current will be observed because the channel is unable to open in response to the voltage change.\n\nB. A sustained inward current will be observed for the entire duration of the 100 ms step.\n\nC. The channel will open, but the resulting outward current will inactivate significantly faster than the wild-type channel.\n\nD. A rapidly activating outward current will be observed, but it will remain sustained for the entire duration of the 100 ms step and will not decay.\n\nE. The channel will open, but the current will be smaller in amplitude and will still show rapid inactivation similar to the wild-type.", "solution": "We analyze the ionic current under voltage clamp using the standard conductance-based formulation. The potassium current during a voltage step is given by\n$$\nI_{K}(t)=g_{K}(t)\\left(V_{m}-E_{K}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $V_{m}$ is the command potential, $E_{K}$ is the potassium reversal potential, and $g_{K}(t)$ is the time-dependent conductance reflecting channel gating. The sign of the current is determined by the driving force $\\left(V_{m}-E_{K}\\right)$ and the direction of $K^{+}$ flow. By the problem statement, for any $V_{m}>-90\\,\\text{mV}$ there is an outward driving force on $K^{+}$, so at $V_{m}=+20\\,\\text{mV}$ we have\n$$\nV_{m}-E_{K}>0,\n$$\nwhich implies an outward current whenever channels are open.\n\nFor voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels with N-type inactivation (wild-type), the conductance can be written as\n$$\ng_{K}(t)=\\bar{g}_{K}\\,m^{p}(t)\\,h_{N}(t),\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{g}_{K}$ is the maximal conductance, $m(t)$ is the activation gating variable that rises rapidly upon depolarization, $p$ is the activation power (channel subunit cooperativity), and $h_{N}(t)$ is the N-type inactivation variable that rapidly declines from $1$ toward $0$ after opening due to the ball-and-chain occlusion. Under a step to $+20\\,\\text{mV}$, $m(t)$ activates quickly, making $g_{K}(t)$ rise, but $h_{N}(t)$ decays rapidly, so $g_{K}(t)$, and hence $I_{K}(t)$, shows a peak followed by a rapid decay toward near zero during the maintained step.\n\nIn the mutant channel with the N-terminal ball domain deleted, the voltage-sensing domains and pore are intact. Thus activation gating remains functional and rapid upon depolarization. However, the N-type inactivation mechanism is abolished. In the gating description, this corresponds to $h_{N}(t)$ being effectively fixed near $1$ (no occlusion), so\n$$\ng_{K}(t)\\approx \\bar{g}_{K}\\,m^{p}(t),\n$$\nwith $m(t)$ approaching its depolarized steady state and not being driven to zero by N-type inactivation. Therefore, during the $+20\\,\\text{mV}$ step,\n$$\nI_{K}(t)=\\bar{g}_{K}\\,m^{p}(t)\\left(V_{m}-E_{K}\\right),\n$$\nwill rapidly activate to a peak and then remain at a sustained plateau determined by the steady-state activation, rather than decaying to near zero. The current will be outward throughout because $\\left(V_{m}-E_{K}\\right)>0$ at $+20\\,\\text{mV}$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the voltage sensors and pore are intact, so the channel can still open.\n- B is incorrect because the driving force at $+20\\,\\text{mV}$ is outward, not inward.\n- C is incorrect because removal of the N-type ball eliminates, rather than accelerates, inactivation.\n- D is correct: the current will activate rapidly and remain sustained without decay during the $100\\,\\text{ms}$ step.\n- E is incorrect because rapid inactivation similar to wild-type would not be present without the ball; amplitude would not necessarily be smaller and often the sustained current would be larger than in wild-type due to the absence of inactivation.\n\nTherefore, the expected current trace is a rapidly activating outward current that remains sustained for the entire $100\\,\\text{ms}$ step without decay.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2330833"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply happening, inactivation is a dynamic process with a distinct timeline.
