This state, known as the refractory period, is crucial for ensuring one-way signal flow and is governed by the kinetics of ion channels. This practice moves beyond a qualitative description, asking you to quantify how the gradual recovery of sodium channels from inactivation directly impacts the propagation speed of a subsequent action potential [@problem_id:2348765]. By working through this calculation, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the dynamic nature of axonal excitability.", "problem": "An action potential propagates along an unmyelinated squid giant axon with a constant velocity. When two action potentials are initiated in close succession, the velocity of the second pulse is observed to be slower than the first. This phenomenon is primarily due to the time required for voltage-gated sodium channels to recover from their inactivated state. Consider a simplified model where the propagation velocity, $v$, of an action potential is directly proportional to the square root of the peak macroscopic sodium current density, $I_{\\text{Na}}$. This peak current, in turn, is directly proportional to the fraction of sodium channels that are in the available (i.e., not inactivated) state at the moment of depolarization.\n\nAssume that for a fully rested axon, the fraction of available channels is 1, and the corresponding action potential propagation velocity is $v_1 = 21.5 \\text{ m/s}$. Immediately after an action potential passes a point on the axon, all sodium channels at that point are inactivated. The fraction of available channels, $f(t)$, then recovers over time according to the first-order kinetic equation:\n$$f(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_h}\\right)$$\nwhere $t$ is the time elapsed since the peak of the first action potential passed and $\\tau_h$ is the time constant for recovery from inactivation.\n\nIf a second action potential is initiated such that its wavefront reaches a given point on the axon precisely $\\Delta t = 2.80 \\text{ ms}$ after the first action potential's peak passed that same point, what is the propagation velocity of this second action potential? The time constant for recovery from inactivation is $\\tau_h = 3.50 \\text{ ms}$.\n\nExpress your final answer in m/s, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the propagation velocity of a second action potential, $v_2$, following a first one by a time interval $\\Delta t$. We are provided with a model that connects the propagation velocity to the fraction of available sodium channels.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between velocity, peak sodium current, and the fraction of available channels.\nThe problem states that the velocity $v$ is proportional to the square root of the peak sodium current density, $I_{\\text{Na}}$. We can write this as:\n$$v = k_1 \\sqrt{I_{\\text{Na}}}$$\nwhere $k_1$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe problem also states that the peak sodium current density $I_{\\text{Na}}$ is proportional to the fraction of available sodium channels, $f$. We can write this as:\n$$I_{\\text{Na}} = k_2 f$$\nwhere $k_2$ is another constant of proportionality.\n\nSubstituting the second relation into the first, we get:\n$$v = k_1 \\sqrt{k_2 f} = (k_1 \\sqrt{k_2}) \\sqrt{f}$$\nLet $K = k_1 \\sqrt{k_2}$ be a new combined constant. Then the relationship between velocity and the fraction of available channels is:\n$$v = K \\sqrt{f}$$\n\nNow, let's apply this relationship to the two action potentials.\nFor the first action potential, the axon is fully rested, so the fraction of available channels is $f_1 = 1$. The velocity is given as $v_1 = 21.5 \\text{ m/s}$. Using our relationship:\n$$v_1 = K \\sqrt{f_1} = K \\sqrt{1} = K$$\nThis conveniently shows that the constant of proportionality $K$ is equal to the velocity of the first (unattenuated) action potential, so $K = 21.5 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\nFor the second action potential, its wavefront arrives at a point on the axon after a time interval $\\Delta t = 2.80 \\text{ ms}$ since the peak of the first pulse passed. At this moment, the fraction of available sodium channels, $f_2$, is determined by the recovery kinetics. The problem gives the formula for recovery as a function of time $t$:\n$$f(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_h}\\right)$$\nWe substitute $t = \\Delta t$ to find the fraction of channels available for the second pulse:\n$$f_2 = f(\\Delta t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_h}\\right)$$\n\nNow we can find the velocity of the second pulse, $v_2$, using the general relationship $v = K \\sqrt{f}$ with $f=f_2$:\n$$v_2 = K \\sqrt{f_2} = v_1 \\sqrt{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_h}\\right)}$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$v_1 = 21.5 \\text{ m/s}$\n$\\Delta t = 2.80 \\text{ ms}$\n$\\tau_h = 3.50 \\text{ ms}$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the exponential term. The units of time (ms) in $\\Delta t$ and $\\tau_h$ will cancel out.\n$$\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_h} = \\frac{2.80 \\text{ ms}}{3.50 \\text{ ms}} = 0.800$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for $v_2$:\n$$v_2 = 21.5 \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\exp(-0.800)}$$\nCalculate the value of the exponential:\n$$\\exp(-0.800) \\approx 0.449329$$\nNow calculate the term inside the square root:\n$$1 - 0.449329 = 0.550671$$\nTake the square root of this value:\n$$\\sqrt{0.550671} \\approx 0.742072$$\nFinally, calculate $v_2$:\n$$v_2 = 21.5 \\times 0.742072 \\approx 15.95455 \\text{ m/s}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$v_2 \\approx 16.0 \\text{ m/s}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16.0}$$", "id": "2348765"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of the refractory period, we can explore a classic thought experiment in neurophysiology.

An action potential is a traveling pulse solution $V(x,t)=\\hat V(x-ct)$ that regenerates because, ahead of the wavefront, sufficient sodium channel availability ($h$ near its resting value and $m$ rapidly activatable) allows inward current $I_{Na}=g_{Na}m^{3}h(V-E_{Na})$ to exceed outward currents, driving $V$ above threshold and recruiting more $m$ in a positive feedback.\n\nAfter the passage of a spike, the membrane enters a refractory state characterized by sodium inactivation (small $h$) and elevated potassium activation (large $n$). Define the absolute refractory interval $t_{ref}$ as the time after the spike during which no suprathreshold depolarization can elicit another spike because the effective sodium conductance $g_{Na}m^{3}h$ is too reduced and the net slope conductance is dominated by outward terms. The spatial extent of this refractory region behind a traveling wavefront is\n$$\n\\ell_{ref} \\;=\\; c\\,t_{ref},\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the propagation speed of the action potential.\n\nPropagation criterion: A wavefront at position $x_{f}(t)$ advances only if, for $x>x_{f}(t)$ (the direction of propagation), the tissue is excitable, meaning $h$ is sufficiently recovered and $n$ not excessively activated so that a small depolarization produces net inward current:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V}\\Big(-I_{ion}(V,m,h,n)\\Big)\\right|_{\\text{ahead}} \\;>\\; 0,\n$$\nwith $I_{ion}=g_{Na}m^{3}h(V-E_{Na})+g_{K}n^{4}(V-E_{K})+g_{L}(V-E_{L})$.

Thus a wavefront cannot propagate into refractory tissue.\n\nConsider two action potentials initiated simultaneously at opposite ends of a long axon and propagating toward each other. Each forms a traveling pulse with a refractory wake of length $\\ell_{ref}$ trailing it. Let the pulses approach and meet at $(x_{c},t_{c})$. Immediately after the meeting, for $x<x_{c}$ just to the left and $x>x_{c}$ just to the right, the membrane has just been depolarized by the respective wavefronts and is within its absolute refractory period; hence on both sides of $x_{c}$ over distances of order $\\ell_{ref}$, $h$ is depressed and $n$ elevated. For either pulse to continue past $x_{c}$, it would have to propagate into the region that has been made refractory by the other pulse. However, the propagation criterion above is not satisfied in refractory tissue because the sodium availability factor $h$ is too small and the outward potassium and leak currents dominate:\n$$\nC_{m}\\,\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{1}{R_{a}}\\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} \\;-\\; \\big[g_{K} n^{4}(V-E_{K})+g_{L}(V-E_{L})\\big],\n$$\nso any depolarizing axial current arriving from the colliding front fails to produce the net inward current necessary for regenerative activation. Consequently, neither action potential can invade the refractory wake of the other, and both wavefronts terminate at the collision point.\n\nBecause the Hodgkin–Huxley system is nonlinear, superposition does not apply; therefore, the pulses do not pass through each other like linear waves (eliminating option A), do not reflect in the absence of an impedance mismatch or boundary that would invert axial current (eliminating option B), cannot merge to produce double or stationary amplitude given the all-or-none nature and the voltage-clamping effect of the large conductances during a spike (eliminating options D and E). After the transient interaction at $x_{c}$, the membrane currents drive $V$ back toward the resting state determined by the balance $I_{ion}=0$ at rest, and the axon returns to rest on both sides once refractoriness subsides.\n\nTherefore, the correct outcome is that the two action potentials extinguish each other at the collision site, and the membrane subsequently returns to resting potential.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2348818"}, {"introduction": "The rapid electrical dance of ions during an action potential comes with a significant metabolic price tag.
