This exercise breaks down the macroscopic current into its fundamental building blocks: the number of channels ($N$), the conductance of a single channel ($\\gamma_K$), and the probability that a channel is open ($p_o$). By exploring a hypothetical mutation that affects only the channel's maximum open probability, you will practice connecting a change at the molecular level to the overall electrical behavior of the cell [@problem_id:2350033].", "problem": "In a patch-clamp electrophysiology experiment, a neuroscientist studies a specific subtype of neuronal Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. The macroscopic potassium current, $I_K$, flowing through a population of these channels in the cell membrane is described by the equation $I_K = N \\cdot p_o \\cdot \\gamma_K \\cdot (V_m - E_K)$, where $N$ is the total number of Kv channels in the membrane patch, $p_o$ is the probability that a single channel is open, $\\gamma_K$ is the conductance of a single open channel, $V_m$ is the membrane potential, and $E_K$ is the Nernst equilibrium potential for potassium ions.\n\nThrough genetic engineering, a point mutation is introduced into the gene encoding this Kv channel. The researcher compares the peak $I_K$ from these mutant channels to the peak current from the normal, or wild-type (WT), channels under identical experimental conditions. The peak current is measured at a specific depolarizing voltage step where the open probability reaches its maximum value for that voltage, $p_{o,max}$.\n\nThe mutation is found to alter the channel's gating mechanism, reducing its maximum open probability, $p_{o,max}$, by exactly 65% compared to the WT channel. However, the mutation does not affect the total number of channels expressed on the membrane ($N$), the single-channel conductance ($\\gamma_K$), or the ion selectivity (meaning $E_K$ remains the same).\n\nAssuming the experiments on WT and mutant channels are performed using the same voltage-clamp protocol and identical ionic concentrations, calculate the ratio of the peak macroscopic potassium current in the mutant neuron to that in the WT neuron, $\\frac{I_{K,mutant}}{I_{K,WT}}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the peak macroscopic potassium current in a neuron with mutant channels to that in a neuron with wild-type (WT) channels, $\\frac{I_{K,mutant}}{I_{K,WT}}$.\n\nThe macroscopic ionic current through a population of channels is given by the general formula:\n$$I = N \\cdot p_o \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot (V_m - E_{ion})$$\nwhere $N$ is the total number of channels, $p_o$ is the open probability of a single channel, $\\gamma$ is the single-channel conductance, $V_m$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{ion}$ is the equilibrium potential for the specific ion.\n\nWe are interested in the peak current, which occurs when the open probability is maximal, $p_o = p_{o,max}$.\n\nFor the wild-type (WT) channels, the peak potassium current, $I_{K,WT}$, is:\n$$I_{K,WT} = N_{WT} \\cdot p_{o,max,WT} \\cdot \\gamma_{K,WT} \\cdot (V_m - E_K)$$\n\nFor the mutant channels, the peak potassium current, $I_{K,mutant}$, is:\n$$I_{K,mutant} = N_{mutant} \\cdot p_{o,max,mutant} \\cdot \\gamma_{K,mutant} \\cdot (V_m - E_K)$$\n\nThe problem states several conditions:\n1.  The experiments are performed under identical conditions, which means the membrane potential step ($V_m$) and the equilibrium potential for potassium ($E_K$) are the same for both WT and mutant recordings. Thus, the driving force, $(V_m - E_K)$, is identical in both cases.\n2.  The mutation does not affect the total number of channels expressed. Therefore, $N_{mutant} = N_{WT}$.\n3.  The mutation does not affect the single-channel conductance. Therefore, $\\gamma_{K,mutant} = \\gamma_{K,WT}$.\n4.  The mutation reduces the maximum open probability by 65%.

Mastering this logic is key to understanding how pharmacological agents or genetic mutations can alter neuronal function.", "problem": "In neurobiology, the shape and duration of an action potential are critically determined by the precise timing of the opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels. A hypothetical neurotoxin, known as prolongotoxin, is being investigated. Its sole effect is to bind to the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels responsible for repolarization. This binding alters the channel's conformation, causing the voltage threshold required for its activation to shift to a significantly more positive (i.e., more depolarized) membrane potential. Assume that the toxin does not affect the resting membrane potential, the voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels, or the peak voltage reached during the action potential.\n\nBased on this specific mechanism of action, what would be the primary and most immediate effect of prolongotoxin on the waveform of a single action potential?\n\nA.

Consequently, after an action potential, $n(t)$ decays more slowly, so $g_{K}(t)=\\bar{g}_{K}\\,n(t)^{4}$ remains elevated for a longer time. Because $I_{K}(t)$ drives the membrane potential toward $E_{K}$, a prolonged elevation of $g_{K}$ prolongs and often deepens the afterhyperpolarization.\n\nDefine the total membrane conductance after a spike as\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{tot}}(t)=g_{L}+g_{K}(t)+g_{\\mathrm{other}},\n$$\nwith $g_{L}$ the leak conductance and $g_{\\mathrm{other}}$ denoting any other resting conductances unaffected by the toxin.

Moreover, the membrane potential is held more negative by the increased $I_{K}$, increasing the depolarization required to reach threshold. Both effects increase the stimulus intensity needed to elicit another action potential during this period.\n\nThe absolute refractory period is determined primarily by the inactivation and recovery of voltage-gated sodium channels, often represented by the gate variable $h(t)$, which Anemonin-K does not affect. Thus, the absolute refractory period is not lengthened by this toxin. In contrast, the relative refractory period is defined as the interval after the absolute refractory period during which a stronger-than-normal stimulus is required to evoke an action potential. Since $g_{K}(t)$ decays more slowly (larger $\\tau_{n,\\mathrm{deact}}$), the time it takes for $g_{K}(t)$ to return close to baseline—and hence for threshold and input resistance to return to normal—increases. If $g_{K}(t)$ decays approximately as $g_{K}(t)\\approx g_{K,0}+\\Delta g_{K}\\exp\\big(-t/\\tau_{n,\\mathrm{deact}}\\big)$, then the time to reach a given near-baseline level is proportional to $\\tau_{n,\\mathrm{deact}}$, so increasing $\\tau_{n,\\mathrm{deact}}$ lengthens that interval.\n\nTherefore, Anemonin-K lengthens the relative refractory period, without lengthening the absolute refractory period.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2350037"}]}
