This practice [@problem_id:2339780] examines the counterintuitive phenomenon of \"depolarization block,\" where sustained depolarization renders a neuron unable to fire. By analyzing this scenario, you will differentiate between the closed, open, and inactivated states of voltage-gated sodium channels and understand why channel availability, not just membrane potential, dictates the ability to generate an action potential.", "problem": "In a clinical condition known as hyperkalemia, the concentration of potassium ions in the extracellular fluid increases. This change elevates the potassium equilibrium potential, causing the resting membrane potential of a typical neuron to shift from its normal value of approximately $-70$ mV to a sustained, depolarized level of $-40$ mV. Experimentally, it is observed that although this initial depolarization might trigger a single action potential, the neuron subsequently becomes inexcitable and cannot generate further action potentials, a phenomenon referred to as depolarization block.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate molecular explanation for this loss of excitability in the neuron held at a steady $-40$ mV membrane potential?\n\nA. The majority of voltage-gated sodium channels are trapped in the inactivated state and cannot be recruited to open in response to a new stimulus.\n\nB. The sustained depolarization causes voltage-gated potassium channels to remain permanently open, effectively shunting any depolarizing current and preventing the membrane potential from reaching the action potential threshold.\n\nC. The sodium-potassium pump reverses its direction of operation, actively pumping sodium ions into the cell so forcefully that the membrane potential is clamped far from the threshold.\n\nD. The voltage-gated sodium channels are locked in their closed, resting conformation, and the $-40$ mV potential is insufficient to cause them to open.\n\nE. The sustained depolarization causes a complete collapse of the sodium ion concentration gradient, eliminating the electrochemical driving force for sodium influx.", "solution": "We analyze excitability using the Hodgkin–Huxley framework for voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels. The membrane sodium current takes the form\n$$\nI_{\\text{Na}} = \\bar{g}_{\\text{Na}}\\, m^{3} h \\left(V - E_{\\text{Na}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the activation variable and $h$ is the inactivation variable.

Under sustained depolarization, $h_{\\infty}(V)$ is a decreasing function of $V$, so at sufficiently depolarized potentials $h_{\\infty}(V)$ becomes small, meaning most channels reside in the inactivated state. At $V=-40$ mV (a depolarized level relative to rest), the neuron will evolve so that\n$$\nh(t) \\to h_{\\infty}(-40 \\text{ mV}),\n$$\nand, because $h_{\\infty}$ is small at such depolarized voltages, the product $m^{3} h$ remains small even if $m$ can still activate. Consequently, the peak available sodium conductance $\\bar{g}_{\\text{Na}} m^{3} h$ becomes too small to produce the regenerative inward sodium current needed to initiate another action potential. Deinactivation (increase of $h$) requires repolarization to more negative potentials, which does not occur under the maintained depolarization. This state of low sodium channel availability explains the depolarization block: a possible initial spike may occur before $h$ decays, but once $h$ relaxes to its steady low value at the depolarized voltage, further action potentials cannot be generated.\n\nWe now assess the options:\n- A. Correct. A sustained depolarization drives $h \\to h_{\\infty}(V)$ at a small value, placing the majority of voltage-gated sodium channels in the inactivated state. Inactivated channels cannot open in response to a new depolarizing stimulus until the membrane repolarizes sufficiently to allow recovery from inactivation.\n- B. Incorrect. While some voltage-gated potassium channels may be partially activated at depolarized potentials, they are not permanently open, and their steady activation at $V=-40$ mV is not the principal cause of depolarization block. The dominant mechanism is the loss of sodium channel availability via inactivation.\n- C. Incorrect. The sodium-potassium ATPase remains an ATP-driven pump whose direction is determined by intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations and ATP hydrolysis, not by membrane depolarization alone. It does not reverse to clamp the membrane near this potential and is not the cause of depolarization block.\n- D. Incorrect. Sodium channels are not locked in the closed resting conformation at $-40$ mV; rather, they preferentially enter the inactivated conformation under sustained depolarization, preventing opening.\n- E. Incorrect. Hyperkalemia does not cause a complete collapse of the sodium concentration gradient. The sodium electrochemical driving force remains substantial; the block is due to sodium channel inactivation, not loss of the gradient.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate molecular explanation for the loss of excitability is that sustained depolarization maintains sodium channels in the inactivated state, preventing their recruitment for action potential initiation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2339780"}, {"introduction": "The total ionic current flowing across a neuronal membrane during an action potential is a sum of individual currents.
