Such a stimulus is referred to as a subthreshold stimulus.\n\n4.  **Apply the All-or-None Principle:**\n    *   The all-or-none principle states that an action potential either occurs at its full, constant amplitude (the \"all\" part) or it does not occur at all (the \"none\" part). There is no such thing as a \"partial\" or \"graded-amplitude\" action potential.\n    *   An action potential is only triggered if the membrane depolarization reaches or exceeds the threshold potential.\n    *   Since the stimulus is subthreshold, no action potential will be generated. The change in potential is a local, passive response called a graded potential (or local potential). These potentials decay over a short distance and time.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A. Incorrect. This suggests a graded-amplitude action potential, which violates the all-or-none principle. Action potentials do not have smaller or larger amplitudes based on stimulus strength; they are uniform.\n    *   B. Incorrect. A full-sized action potential is not generated because the stimulus was subthreshold; the membrane potential did not reach -55 mV.\n    *   C. Correct. The subthreshold stimulus causes a local, temporary depolarization to -60 mV. Since the threshold is not met, the neuron's ion channels that restore the resting potential will quickly bring the membrane back to -70 mV without an action potential firing. This describes a subthreshold graded potential.\n    *   D. Incorrect. The stimulus was depolarizing (making the inside less negative), not hyperpolarizing (making the inside more negative).\n\nTherefore, the neuron's membrane will exhibit a small, local depolarization that fails to trigger an action potential and subsequently returns to its resting state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2352323"}, {"introduction": "Once a neuron's threshold is reached, it fires an action potential.

Stronger stimuli cause the neuron to generate action potentials at a higher frequency.\n\nE. Any stimulus below 10.0 nA is incapable of eliciting a significant response from the axon.", "solution": "The goal is to identify the conclusion that is best supported by the provided experimental data and illustrates the all-or-none principle. The all-or-none principle states that if a stimulus is strong enough to bring the membrane potential to a certain threshold, the neuron will fire a full-sized action potential. The amplitude (size) of this action potential is independent of the stimulus strength, as long as the stimulus is at or above the threshold. If the stimulus is below the threshold (sub-threshold), it will not trigger an action potential.\n\nLet's analyze the data table step-by-step.\nThe resting potential is -70 mV.\n\n1.  For stimulus currents of 1.0 nA, 2.0 nA, 3.0 nA, and 4.0 nA, the peak membrane potential changes, but it remains negative and far below the typical peak of an action potential. These are small, graded depolarizations. For instance, a 1.0 nA stimulus causes a 2.0 mV depolarization (from -70 mV to -68 mV), and a 4.0 nA stimulus causes an 8.0 mV depolarization (from -70 mV to -62 mV). These are considered \"none\" responses in the context of the all-or-none principle; they are sub-threshold events.\n\n2.  When the stimulus current is increased from 4.0 nA to 5.0 nA, there is a dramatic change in the response. The peak membrane potential jumps from -62.0 mV to +35.0 mV. This large, positive-going potential is characteristic of an action potential. This indicates that a stimulus of 5.0 nA is at or above the threshold intensity required to trigger an action potential.\n\n3.  For all subsequent stimuli with intensities greater than 5.0 nA (i.e., 6.0 nA, 8.0 nA, and 10.0 nA), the peak membrane potential reached is consistently +35.0 mV. Increasing the stimulus strength from 5.0 nA to 10.0 nA does not produce a larger action potential. The amplitude of the action potential remains constant.\n\nThis behavior is the hallmark of the all-or-none principle. Below a certain threshold (somewhere between 4.0 nA and 5.0 nA), you get \"none\" (no action potential). At or above that threshold, you get \"all\" (a full-sized, constant-amplitude action potential).\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. **Stimuli at or above a threshold intensity of 5.0 nA produce an action potential of a constant amplitude, whereas stimuli below this threshold do not.** This statement accurately summarizes the observations from the data. Stimuli from 1.0 to 4.0 nA are sub-threshold and produce graded potentials. Stimuli from 5.0 nA and above are supra-threshold and produce an action potential of a fixed peak amplitude (+35.0 mV). This is a perfect description of the all-or-none principle as demonstrated by the experiment.\n\nB. **The amplitude of the membrane potential change is directly proportional to the intensity of the stimulus current across the entire range tested.** This is incorrect. While the response is roughly proportional for sub-threshold stimuli (1.0 to 4.0 nA), there is a massive, discontinuous jump in response at 5.0 nA. Furthermore, for stimuli from 5.0 nA to 10.0 nA, the response amplitude is constant, not proportional to the stimulus.\n\nC. **The axon membrane becomes less responsive as the stimulus intensity increases, a phenomenon known as adaptation.** This is not supported by the data. In fact, the membrane shows its largest response at 5.0 nA and maintains this large response for even stronger stimuli. Adaptation would imply a decreasing response to a sustained or repeated stimulus, which is not what was tested here.\n\nD. **Stronger stimuli cause the neuron to generate action potentials at a higher frequency.** While this is a general principle of neural coding (frequency coding), the experiment described does not provide data to support it. The experiment measured the peak amplitude of a single response to a single, brief stimulus pulse, not the rate of firing over time. Therefore, this conclusion cannot be drawn from the given data.\n\nE. **Any stimulus below 10.0 nA is incapable of eliciting a significant response from the axon.** This is clearly false. A stimulus of 5.0 nA elicits a very significant response (an action potential). Even the sub-threshold stimuli (1.0-4.0 nA) elicit measurable, albeit small, responses.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that best aligns with the all-or-none principle and is fully supported by the provided data is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2352330"}]}
