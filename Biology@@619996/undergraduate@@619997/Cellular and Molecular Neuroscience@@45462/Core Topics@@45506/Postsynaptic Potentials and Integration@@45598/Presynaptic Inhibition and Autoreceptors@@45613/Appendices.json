Autoreceptors provide a classic example of negative feedback, where the neuron's own neurotransmitter release modulates subsequent release. This first exercise [@problem_id:2348681] presents a foundational thought experiment to test your grasp of this concept by exploring what happens when this feedback loop is pharmacologically interrupted with an antagonist.", "problem": "In a neurobiology laboratory, a researcher is studying a population of neurons that utilize acetylcholine (ACh) as their primary neurotransmitter. These cholinergic neurons are known to have presynaptic autoreceptors on their axon terminals. It has been established that the activation of these autoreceptors by ACh present in the synaptic cleft initiates a G-protein-coupled signaling cascade that partially inhibits voltage-gated calcium channels in the presynaptic membrane.\n\nThe researcher applies a novel experimental compound to the neural preparation. This compound is a highly specific competitive antagonist for these presynaptic cholinergic autoreceptors. It binds strongly to the receptors but does not activate them, effectively preventing the binding of ACh.\n\nAssuming all other conditions remain constant, what is the most likely immediate effect of applying this antagonist on the quantity of ACh released from the presynaptic terminal each time a single action potential arrives?\n\nA. The amount of ACh released per action potential will increase.\n\nB. The amount of ACh released per action potential will decrease.\n\nC. The amount of ACh released per action potential will remain unchanged.\n\nD. The firing rate of the presynaptic neuron will increase.\n\nE. The enzymatic degradation of ACh in the synaptic cleft will be accelerated.", "solution": "The presynaptic cholinergic autoreceptors described are G-protein-coupled receptors that, when activated by acetylcholine (ACh) in the synaptic cleft, inhibit presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels. The general principle of transmitter release at chemical synapses is that the probability of vesicle fusion and thus transmitter release per action potential depends steeply on presynaptic calcium influx, typically modeled as\n$$\nR \\propto [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n},\n$$\nwith $n \\ge 3$, where $R$ is the amount of transmitter released per action potential and $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ is the peak local calcium concentration at release sites.\n\nActivation of the autoreceptor leads to partial inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels, which decreases $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ during an action potential and therefore reduces $R$. A competitive antagonist that binds to these autoreceptors without activating them prevents ACh from activating the inhibitory pathway. This removes or reduces the inhibitory G-protein signal on the calcium channels, leading to greater calcium channel activity during an action potential, hence a larger $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ transient.\n\nBy the relation $R \\propto [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}$, an increase in $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ increases $R$, the amount of ACh released per action potential. This is an immediate effect, as it follows directly from acute disinhibition of calcium channels.\n\nOther options are inconsistent with the mechanism: the firing rate of the presynaptic neuron (option D) is determined by upstream excitability, not by presynaptic terminal autoreceptors in this context, and enzymatic degradation of ACh (option E), governed by acetylcholinesterase, is not directly altered by a receptor antagonist. Therefore, the most likely immediate effect is an increase in ACh released per action potential.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2348681"}, {"introduction": "To move from a conceptual to a quantitative understanding, we must learn to work with the numbers that govern synaptic strength. This problem introduces the concept of quantal content, $m$, which is defined by the product of the number of releasable vesicles, $n$, and their average release probability, $p$. This exercise [@problem_id:2348665] provides a practical application, asking you to calculate how activating an inhibitory autoreceptor with an agonist directly reduces release probability and, consequently, the overall quantal content of the synapse.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating synaptic transmission at a glutamatergic synapse in the central nervous system (CNS). This synapse exhibits a form of self-regulation through presynaptic autoreceptors. The average number of neurotransmitter vesicles released per action potential, known as the quantal content ($m$), is a product of the number of vesicles in the readily releasable pool ($n$) and the average probability of release for a single vesicle ($p$).\n\nIn the baseline state, the synapse has a readily releasable pool of $n = 120$ vesicles, and the probability of release for any given vesicle is $p = 0.25$.\n\nThe researcher then applies a drug that is a selective agonist for the presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptors at this terminal. Activation of these receptors is known to modulate voltage-gated calcium channels, leading to a reduction in calcium influx upon arrival of an action potential. This intervention causes the average probability of vesicle release, $p$, to decrease by 60% from its baseline value. Assume the size of the readily releasable pool, $n$, is not affected by the short-term application of this drug.\n\nCalculate the new quantal content of the synapse after the application of the drug.", "solution": "The quantal content is defined as $m = n p$, where $n$ is the readily releasable pool size and $p$ is the average probability of release per vesicle.\n\nBaseline values are $n = 120$ and $p = 0.25$, yielding a baseline quantal content $m_{\\text{baseline}} = 120 \\times 0.25 = 30$.\n\nThe drug decreases $p$ by 0.60 of its baseline value, so the new release probability is\n$$\np_{\\text{new}} = p \\left(1 - 0.60\\right) = 0.25 \\times 0.40 = 0.10.\n$$\nThe pool size is unchanged, so $n_{\\text{new}} = n = 120$. Therefore, the new quantal content is\n$$\nm_{\\text{new}} = n_{\\text{new}} \\, p_{\\text{new}} = 120 \\times 0.10 = 12.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "2348665"}, {"introduction": "The influence of presynaptic inhibition is not always linear; in fact, its power often lies in an amplification effect. Neurotransmitter release is highly sensitive to changes in presynaptic calcium concentration, often following a power-law relationship, such as $R \\propto [Ca^{2+}]^{4}$. This final practice problem [@problem_id:2348646] allows you to explore the profound consequences of this non-linearity, demonstrating how a modest, autoreceptor-mediated reduction in calcium influx can lead to a much larger and more significant decrease in neurotransmitter release.", "problem": "In a particular glutamatergic synapse, the rate of vesicle fusion and subsequent neurotransmitter release, $R$, is found to be directly proportional to the fourth power of the transient intracellular calcium concentration, $[Ca^{2+}]$, achieved at the presynaptic terminal during an action potential. This relationship can be modeled by the equation $R = k [Ca^{2+}]^4$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThis synapse is subject to feedback regulation via presynaptic metabotropic glutamate autoreceptors. When activated by high concentrations of glutamate in the synaptic cleft, these receptors trigger a G-protein-mediated signaling cascade that partially inhibits the synapse's Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels (VGCCs).\n\nConsider a scenario where a sustained period of high-frequency stimulation leads to the activation of these autoreceptors. This activation results in a new steady state where the total influx of calcium ions per action potential is reduced by 18.0% compared to the influx under basal conditions.\n\nCalculate the percentage reduction in the rate of neurotransmitter release from this new inhibited state compared to the original basal state. Express your answer as a decimal, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The release rate is modeled as $R = k[Ca^{2+}]^{4}$. Let the basal calcium transient be $[Ca^{2+}]_{0}$ with basal release rate $R_{0} = k[Ca^{2+}]_{0}^{4}$. A reduction of the total calcium influx by a fraction $0.180$ scales the transient calcium to $[Ca^{2+}]_{1} = (1 - 0.180)[Ca^{2+}]_{0} = 0.820[Ca^{2+}]_{0}$, assuming the transient concentration scales linearly with influx.\n\nThe new release rate is\n$$\nR_{1} = k[Ca^{2+}]_{1}^{4} = k(0.820[Ca^{2+}]_{0})^{4} = k[Ca^{2+}]_{0}^{4}(0.820)^{4} = R_{0}(0.820)^{4}.\n$$\nTherefore, the fractional reduction in release is\n$$\n\\frac{R_{0} - R_{1}}{R_{0}} = 1 - (0.820)^{4}.\n$$\nCompute the power:\n$$\n(0.820)^{2} = 0.6724,\\quad (0.820)^{4} = (0.6724)^{2} = 0.45212176,\n$$\nso the reduction is\n$$\n1 - 0.45212176 = 0.54787824.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $0.548$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.548}$$", "id": "2348646"}]}
