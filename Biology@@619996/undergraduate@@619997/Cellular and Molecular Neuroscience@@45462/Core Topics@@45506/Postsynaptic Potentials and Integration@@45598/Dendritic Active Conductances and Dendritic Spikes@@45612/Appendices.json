Using a patch-clamp electrode placed on a distal dendritic branch, the scientist injects a brief, 5 ms pulse of depolarizing current.

Fast regenerative dendritic spikes are driven by voltage-gated sodium channels, which produce a rapid inward current described by the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism:\n$$\nI_{\\text{Na}} = g_{\\text{Na}} m^{3} h (V - E_{\\text{Na}}),\n$$\nwhere $g_{\\text{Na}}$ is the maximal sodium conductance, $m$ and $h$ are the activation and inactivation variables, $V$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{\\text{Na}}$ is the sodium reversal potential. In the control condition, a brief depolarizing current pulse of 5 ms can cross threshold, activating $I_{\\text{Na}}$ and generating a fast spike with duration approximately 2-3 ms, which is characteristic of sodium-based regenerative events.\n\nTetrodotoxin (TTX) blocks voltage-gated sodium channels by occluding the pore, effectively setting $g_{\\text{Na}} \\to 0$. After TTX application, the sodium current term $I_{\\text{Na}}$ is abolished:\n$$\nI_{\\text{Na}} = 0 \\quad \\text{(in TTX)}.\n$$\nThe membrane equation for the dendrite can be written as\n$$\nC_{m} \\frac{dV}{dt} = -g_{L} (V - E_{L}) - \\sum I_{\\text{active}} + I_{\\text{inj}},\n$$\nwhere $C_{m}$ is membrane capacitance, $g_{L}$ is leak conductance, $E_{L}$ is leak reversal potential, and $I_{\\text{inj}}$ is the injected current. In control, $\\sum I_{\\text{active}}$ includes $I_{\\text{Na}}$; in TTX, the sodium term is removed, leaving only leak and any remaining active currents (e.g., calcium or potassium).\n\nGiven that the same brief 5 ms current pulse previously elicited only a fast sodium spike (and not a calcium spike), removing sodium conductance eliminates the fast regenerative mechanism. Calcium spikes are typically slower and require stronger or more prolonged depolarization to recruit high-voltage-activated calcium channels. With the same stimulus that previously just reached sodium spike threshold, and without the rapid depolarizing assistance from $I_{\\text{Na}}$, the conditions are insufficient to trigger a calcium spike. Therefore, the response reduces to the passive membrane behavior (to first approximation, if calcium channels are not significantly engaged).\n\nUnder passive conditions, with only leak and the injected current, the voltage response during the pulse follows\n$$\nC_{m} \\frac{dV}{dt} = -g_{L} (V - E_{L}) + I_{\\text{inj}},\n$$\nwhich yields a depolarizing response that approaches a steady-state change\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\infty} = \\frac{I_{\\text{inj}}}{g_{L}},\n$$\nwith time constant\n$$\n\\tau_{m} = \\frac{C_{m}}{g_{L}}.\n$$\nAfter the 5 ms pulse ends, the voltage decays exponentially back to rest:\n$$\nV(t) - E_{L} \\propto \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{m}}\\right).\n$$\n\nThis analysis excludes options suggesting unaffected spiking (C), hyperpolarization (D), or hyperexcitability with bursts (E), all of which contradict the blockade of sodium channels. Replacement by a slower, broader dendritic spike (B) would require sufficient activation of calcium conductances, which is not expected under the same brief stimulus that originally recruited only a sodium spike. Therefore, the expected outcome is a small, passive depolarization that decays back to rest without a spike.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2333266"}, {"introduction": "Dendrites don't just produce fast, brief spikes; they can also generate prolonged depolarizations called plateau potentials, which are critical for synaptic integration and plasticity. This exercise shifts focus from fast spikes driven by $Na_V$ channels to these sustained events, which rely on a different molecular player: the NMDA receptor. By analyzing the effect of the NMDA receptor blocker APV, you will explore the unique voltage-dependent properties that allow synaptic inputs to trigger these long-lasting signals [@problem_id:2333203].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is studying dendritic integration in a pyramidal neuron from the hippocampus. Strong, high-frequency stimulation of a cluster of presynaptic inputs onto a dendritic branch evokes a complex local depolarization known as a dendritic plateau potential.

This depolarization relieves the $Mg^{2+}$ block of NMDA receptors, allowing substantial NMDA current that sustains a long-lasting plateau over hundreds of milliseconds.\n\nDL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) is a selective NMDA receptor antagonist. Its application blocks NMDA receptor-mediated currents without directly affecting AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Therefore:\n- The fast, AMPA-mediated initial depolarization should remain largely intact because AMPA receptors are not blocked by APV.\n- The slow, sustained plateau phase should be significantly reduced or eliminated because it depends critically on NMDA receptor activation and its voltage-dependent, regenerative current.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because AMPA-mediated excitatory transmission persists.\n- B is incorrect because blocking NMDA receptors does not enhance the AMPA-mediated initial phase; rather, it removes the NMDA contribution.\n- C is correct: the initial, rapid AMPA-mediated phase is largely unaffected, while the NMDA-dependent sustained plateau is significantly reduced or abolished.\n- D is incorrect because blocking NMDA receptors shortens, rather than prolongs, the response.\n- E is incorrect because the reduction is not equal across phases; the sustained phase is preferentially and strongly reduced.\n\nThus, the expected change is best captured by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2333203"}, {"introduction": "Having established the roles of different ion channels, we can now delve deeper into how their specific biophysical properties shape neuronal signals. This thought experiment explores the link between the molecular kinetics of an ion channel and the emergent properties of a dendritic spike. By considering a hypothetical mutation that slows the inactivation of $Na_V$ channels, you will predict the consequences for both the spike's duration and its ability to propagate, revealing how subtle molecular changes can have a major impact on information flow within a neuron [@problem_id:2333228].", "problem": "In the apical dendrites of a cortical pyramidal neuron, the generation and propagation of fast dendritic spikes are primarily mediated by high densities of voltage-gated sodium channels ($Na_V$). These spikes serve as a mechanism for amplifying and processing synaptic inputs. Consider a genetically engineered mouse model expressing a specific point mutation in the gene encoding the primary dendritic $Na_V$ channel subunit. This mutation does not affect the voltage-dependence of channel activation or the single-channel conductance, but it significantly slows the kinetics of the channel's inactivation gate. Specifically, the time constant for the transition from the open state to the inactivated state is doubled compared to the wild-type channel.\n\nA neurophysiologist initiates a single, fast dendritic spike at a specific point on the apical dendrite using a brief, suprathreshold current injection. The experiment then compares the properties of this spike in the mutant neuron to those in a wild-type neuron under identical conditions.\n\nAssuming all other cellular properties (e.g., potassium channel kinetics, membrane resistance, capacitance, and dendritic morphology) are unchanged, what are the most likely effects of this mutation on the spike's duration and its propagation fidelity? The spike duration is measured locally at the site of initiation, and propagation fidelity refers to the probability that the spike will successfully travel a fixed distance down the dendrite away from the initiation site.\n\nA. The spike duration will decrease, and its propagation fidelity will decrease.\n\nB. The spike duration will increase, and its propagation fidelity will decrease.\n\nC.

The spike duration will remain unchanged, but its propagation fidelity will increase.\n\nF. The spike duration will increase, but its propagation fidelity will remain unchanged.", "solution": "Let the local fast dendritic spike be governed by a Hodgkin–Huxley type sodium current\n$$\nI_{Na}(t)=\\bar{g}_{Na}\\,m^{3}(t)\\,h(t)\\,\\big(V(t)-E_{Na}\\big),\n$$\nwith activation variable $m$ and inactivation variable $h$. By assumption, the mutation does not alter the voltage-dependence of activation or the single-channel conductance, so $\\bar{g}_{Na}$ and the kinetics of $m$ are unchanged. The mutation specifically doubles the time constant for the transition from the open to inactivated state, which in the standard gating formalism is captured by slowing the inactivation kinetics. Writing the inactivation dynamics as\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt}=\\frac{h_{\\infty}(V)-h}{\\tau_{h}(V)},\n$$\nthe mutation is modeled as $\\tau_{h}'(V)=2\\,\\tau_{h}(V)$ for the relevant depolarized voltages during the spike, with $h_{\\infty}(V)$ unchanged.\n\nFor a brief, suprathreshold current injection that elicits a single fast spike, $m$ activates rapidly and $h$ decreases toward $h_{\\infty}(V)$ during the depolarized phase. Over the near-peak depolarized portion of the spike, $V$ changes relatively slowly compared to $m$ and $h$ time courses, and $h_{\\infty}(V)$ is small. Approximating $V$ as quasi-stationary near its peak and $h_{\\infty}(V)\\approx 0$ during this phase, the inactivation variable decays approximately exponentially:\n$$\nh(t)\\approx h_{0}\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{h}}\\Big),\\qquad\nh'(t)\\approx h_{0}\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{t}{2\\,\\tau_{h}}\\Big),\n$$\nwhere primes denote the mutant. Because $m$-activation kinetics and $m_{\\infty}(V)$ are unchanged, the principal difference in $I_{Na}$ is the slower decay of $h(t)$ in the mutant. Consequently, for comparable voltage trajectories $V(t)$ over the upstroke and early repolarization, the mutant maintains a larger $m^{3}h$ product for longer, yielding a larger and more prolonged inward sodium current. Repolarization of the spike occurs when the net membrane current switches from inward to outward, i.e., when the outward currents (e.g., potassium and leak, unchanged by assumption) exceed the inward sodium current. Since $I_{Na}$ decays more slowly in the mutant, the crossing to net outward current is delayed, increasing the spike duration measured locally. More formally, if one defines the end of the spike as the first time $T$ at which $I_{Na}(T)$ falls to a fixed fraction that balances the outward current, then with $h(t)$ exponential,\n$$\nI_{Na}(T)\\propto m^{3}(T)\\,h_{0}\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{h}}\\Big),\n$$\nand the corresponding mutant time $T'$ satisfying the same balance obeys\n$$\n\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{T'}{2\\,\\tau_{h}}\\Big)\\approx \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{h}}\\Big)\\,\\frac{m^{3}(T)}{m^{3}(T')}.\n$$\nSince $m$-kinetics are fast and similar across $T$ and $T'$ near this balance point, $m^{3}(T')\\approx m^{3}(T)$ to first approximation, implying $T'\\approx 2T$. Thus the spike duration increases when inactivation is slowed.\n\nFor propagation fidelity along the dendrite, consider the active cable equation where axial current from the initiation site charges adjacent dendritic segments. The ability of the spike to propagate is governed by a safety factor that compares the depolarizing charge delivered to the next segment to the losses through membrane conductances.

The axial charge delivered downstream satisfies\n$$\nQ_{ax}\\approx \\alpha\\,Q_{Na},\n$$\nfor some coupling factor $\\alpha$ set by dendritic geometry and passive properties (unchanged by assumption). Therefore $Q_{ax}'\\approx \\alpha\\,Q_{Na}'>Q_{ax}$. Since the downstream segment’s excitation threshold and outward losses are unchanged, an increase in $Q_{ax}$ increases the safety factor and thus the probability that the spike will successfully propagate a fixed distance. Hence, propagation fidelity increases.\n\nCombining these results: slowing sodium channel inactivation prolongs the spike and increases the depolarizing drive for propagation, leading to increased spike duration and increased propagation fidelity.
