This first exercise [@problem_id:2342344] explores the fundamental concept of competitive antagonism at the GABA-B receptor. By predicting the effect of an antagonist like saclofen, you will reinforce your knowledge of the receptor's role in generating inhibitory postsynaptic potentials through potassium channel activation.", "problem": "In the central nervous system, Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) serves as the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Its effects are mediated by different receptors, including the metabotropic GABA-B receptor. This receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that, upon binding to GABA, initiates a signal transduction cascade. This cascade results in the activation of a G-protein-gated inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel, which allows potassium ions (K$^{+}$) to flow out of the neuron.\n\nA neuroscientist is conducting an experiment on a postsynaptic neuron that exclusively expresses GABA-B receptors at a particular synapse. In the control condition, a presynaptic neuron is stimulated, causing the release of GABA and a resulting change in the postsynaptic membrane potential. In the experimental condition, the synapse is first treated with a high concentration of saclofen, a specific competitive antagonist for the GABA-B receptor. Following this treatment, the same presynaptic stimulation is applied.\n\nCompared to the response in the control condition (GABA release without saclofen), what is the most likely effect of pre-treating the synapse with saclofen on the postsynaptic membrane potential immediately following the release of GABA?\n\nA. Saclofen will cause a larger and more prolonged hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane.\nB. Saclofen will cause a depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, exciting the neuron.\nC. Saclofen will prevent the hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane that would normally occur.\nD. Saclofen will have no effect, and the postsynaptic membrane potential will change in the same way as the control.\nE. Saclofen will mimic the effect of GABA, causing a standard hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane.", "solution": "We identify the relevant physiological mechanism: at this synapse the postsynaptic neuron expresses only GABA-B receptors, which are metabotropic GPCRs. When GABA binds GABA-B, the associated G-protein is activated, and the released $G\\beta\\gamma$ subunits open G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. Opening $K^+$ channels increases $K^+$ conductance, driving the membrane potential $V_{m}$ toward the $K^+$ equilibrium potential $E_{K}$, which is more negative than the resting $V_{m}$. Thus, in control, GABA causes a hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potential due to $K^+$ efflux.\n\nWe formalize the receptor-ligand interaction with competitive antagonism. Let $A$ denote agonist (GABA) concentration and $I$ denote antagonist (saclofen) concentration. For a competitive antagonist, the fractional receptor occupancy by the agonist is given by the law of mass action:\n$$\n\\theta=\\frac{[A]}{[A]+K_{d}\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right)}.\n$$\nWith a high $[I]$ (as stated), the factor $\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right)$ becomes large, so $\\theta\\to 0$ for fixed $[A]$. Therefore, receptor activation by GABA is effectively prevented.\n\nBecause the postsynaptic effect (opening of GIRK channels and $K^+$ efflux) depends on GABA-B activation, reducing $\\theta$ to near zero prevents the G-protein activation and GIRK opening. Without increased $K^+$ conductance, $V_{m}$ does not move toward $E_{K}$, so the hyperpolarization that normally follows GABA release does not occur.\n\nThe synapse is specified to express only GABA-B receptors; thus, blocking these receptors will not produce depolarization (no alternative excitatory receptor is engaged) and will not mimic GABA (saclofen is an antagonist, not an agonist). It will have an effect (it prevents the normal response), so it is not without effect.\n\nTherefore, compared to control, pre-treatment with saclofen prevents the hyperpolarization that would normally occur after GABA release.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2342344"}, {"introduction": "Having established the GABA-B receptor's role in modulating membrane potential, we now shift our focus to the underlying biophysics using the voltage-clamp technique. This practice problem [@problem_id:2342321] presents a classic thought experiment that tests your understanding of the relationship between channel conductance and electrochemical driving force. By considering a scenario where the driving force for potassium ions is nullified, you can gain a deeper insight into the principles governing ionic current, which is described by the relation $I_{\\text{ion}} = g(V_m - E_{\\text{rev}})$.", "problem": "An electrophysiologist is investigating the properties of a specific neuron isolated from the mammalian central nervous system. The neuron is known to express a high density of metabotropic Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) receptors, specifically the GABA-B subtype. The experiment is conducted using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique, which allows the experimenter to set and maintain the neuron's membrane potential ($V_m$) at a desired value and measure the total transmembrane current.\n\nFor this particular neuron, under the given ionic conditions, the equilibrium potential for potassium ions ($E_K$) is calculated to be -95 mV, and the resting membrane potential is -70 mV. The researcher clamps the neuron's membrane potential at exactly -95 mV. After allowing the system to stabilize, a potent and specific GABA-B receptor agonist is rapidly perfused into the bath surrounding the neuron.\n\nAssuming the agonist only affects the GABA-B receptor and its downstream G-protein-coupled signaling pathway which primarily modulates potassium channels, what net transmembrane current would be measured by the voltage-clamp amplifier immediately following the application of the agonist?\n\nA. A large, sustained outward current.\nB. A large, sustained inward current.\nC. No net change in current.\nD. A small, transient inward current.\nE. A small, transient outward current.", "solution": "We apply voltage-clamp principles and the Ohmic description of ionic currents.\n\nUnder voltage clamp, the amplifier sets $V_{m}$ to a command value $V_{\\text{hold}}$ and supplies a clamp current $I_{\\text{clamp}}$ that exactly balances the membrane current so that $V_{m}$ remains constant. The total membrane current is the sum of ionic and capacitive currents:\n$$\nI_{\\text{mem}} \\equiv I_{\\text{ion}} + I_{C}, \\quad I_{C} = C_{m}\\frac{dV_{m}}{dt}.\n$$\nAt steady clamp with $V_{m}$ held constant, $\\frac{dV_{m}}{dt}=0$ so $I_{C}=0$. Therefore, the amplifier-measured current equals the negative of the net ionic current:\n$$\nI_{\\text{clamp}} = - I_{\\text{ion}}.\n$$\n\nActivation of metabotropic GABA-B receptors increases the potassium conductance via G-protein-gated K^{+} channels. The potassium current obeys Ohm’s law:\n$$\nI_{K} = g_{K}\\left(V_{m} - E_{K}\\right).\n$$\nLet the holding potential be $V_{\\text{hold}}$ and, upon agonist application, the potassium conductance change from $g_{K}$ to $g_{K} + \\Delta g_{K}$.

Hence\n$$\nV_{\\text{hold}} - E_{K} = 0 \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; I_{K,\\text{before}} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad I_{K,\\text{after}} = 0.\n$$\nThus, despite an increase in $g_{K}$, the driving force for K^{+} is zero at $V_{\\text{hold}}=E_{K}$, so the net K^{+} current does not change. By the problem’s assumption that only the GABA-B pathway affecting K^{+} channels is engaged, other ionic currents are unchanged.

The key information is that the current-voltage (I-V) relationship for the GABA-B receptor-mediated current is linear.\n\nThe linear I-V relationship for an ion channel can be described by Ohm's law adapted for electrophysiology:\n$$I = g(V_m - E_{rev})$$\nwhere $I$ is the current flowing through the channels, $g$ is the total conductance of the activated channels, $V_m$ is the clamped membrane potential, and $E_{rev}$ is the reversal potential for the ion(s) carrying the current. In this specific experiment, $g$ and $E_{rev}$ are constants determined by the properties of the activated GABA-B receptor-gated channels and the ionic concentrations across the membrane.\n\nWe have two unknowns, $g$ and $E_{rev}$, and two sets of measurements $(V_1, I_1)$ and $(V_2, I_2)$. We can set up a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $I_1 = g(V_1 - E_{rev})$\n2.  $I_2 = g(V_2 - E_{rev})$\n\nTo find the unknowns, we can first solve for the reversal potential, $E_{rev}$.
