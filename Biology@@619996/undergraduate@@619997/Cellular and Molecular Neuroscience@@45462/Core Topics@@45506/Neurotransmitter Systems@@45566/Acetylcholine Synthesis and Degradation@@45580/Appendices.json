{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Efficient and sustained cholinergic signaling depends on the rapid recycling of its components. The synthesis of new acetylcholine (ACh) is often limited by the availability of its precursor, choline. This practice explores the crucial process of choline reuptake by the presynaptic neuron, a classic example of secondary active transport. By reasoning through a hypothetical experiment where the essential sodium ion gradient is removed, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how ion gradients power nutrient and neurotransmitter transport throughout the nervous system [@problem_id:2326225].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is studying the molecular machinery of a cholinergic synapse. It is known that after acetylcholine (ACh) is released into the synaptic cleft, it is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase into choline and acetate. The presynaptic neuron then recycles the choline for the synthesis of new ACh. This recycling is accomplished by a high-affinity choline transporter (CHT), a protein located on the presynaptic membrane. The CHT is a symporter that utilizes the electrochemical gradient of sodium ions ($Na^+$) to move choline from the synaptic cleft back into the presynaptic terminal. Specifically, the transport of one molecule of choline is coupled to the transport of two $Na^+$ ions into the neuron.\n\nIn an experiment, this synapse is bathed in an artificial extracellular fluid that is identical to physiological fluid except that all sodium chloride ($\\text{NaCl}$) has been replaced by lithium chloride ($\\text{LiCl}$). Assume that lithium ions ($Li^+$) are not transported by the CHT and that the presynaptic neuron continues to fire, releasing its pre-existing stores of ACh.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence of this experimental condition on the acetylcholine life cycle?\n\nA. The rate of acetylcholine synthesis will increase to compensate for the altered ionic environment.\n\nB. Choline reuptake will be inhibited, leading to a decreased rate of acetylcholine synthesis.\n\nC. The activity of the enzyme Choline Acetyltransferase (ChAT), which synthesizes acetylcholine, will be directly inhibited by the absence of extracellular sodium.\n\nD. Acetylcholine will accumulate to high levels in the synaptic cleft because its degradation is blocked.\n\nE. The high-affinity choline transporter will reverse its direction, pumping choline out of the presynaptic terminal.", "solution": "The relevant biochemical and transport processes are:\n1) Acetylcholine hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase:\n$$\\text{ACh} \\xrightarrow{\\text{AChE}} \\text{choline} + \\text{acetate}.$$\n2) Acetylcholine synthesis by choline acetyltransferase:\n$$\\text{choline} + \\text{acetyl-CoA} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ChAT}} \\text{ACh} + \\text{CoA}.$$\n3) High-affinity choline uptake by the presynaptic CHT, which is a sodium-coupled symporter with the stoichiometry:\n$$\\text{choline}_{out} + 2\\,Na^+_{out} \\to \\text{choline}_{in} + 2\\,Na^+_{in}.$$\n\nPrinciple: A secondary active symporter requires binding of the coupled ion on the appropriate side and a favorable electrochemical gradient to drive transport. If $Na^+$ is replaced extracellularly by $Li^+$, and $Li^+$ is not transported by CHT, then the required $Na^+$ binding and the inward $Na^+$ electrochemical gradient are absent. Therefore, CHT-mediated choline uptake is effectively blocked.\n\nUnder the experimental condition (all extracellular $\\text{NaCl}$ replaced by $\\text{LiCl}$, with $Li^+$ not a substrate for CHT):\n- $Na^+_{out}$ is effectively absent, so $2\\,Na^+_{out}$ cannot bind to CHT. The symport cycle cannot proceed, so choline reuptake from the cleft is inhibited.\n- ACh release continues transiently from pre-existing vesicular stores, and AChE remains active; ACh degradation is not $Na^+$-dependent. Thus, ACh will not accumulate; it will be hydrolyzed to choline and acetate, but the produced choline will not be efficiently reclaimed and will be lost from the cleft by diffusion.\n- The rate of ACh synthesis in the terminal depends critically on intracellular choline availability. With CHT blocked, intracellular choline supply decreases, making choline availability rate-limiting for ChAT. ChAT itself is not directly inhibited by extracellular $Na^+$; rather, its substrate becomes scarce.\n- Without $Na^+$ binding and gradient, CHT will not reverse to export choline; lack of the coupled ion precludes transporter cycling in either direction.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Incorrect. There is no compensatory increase in synthesis; instead, synthesis falls due to substrate (choline) scarcity.\n- B: Correct. Choline reuptake is inhibited, which decreases the rate of ACh synthesis by limiting choline availability.\n- C: Incorrect. ChAT activity is not directly inhibited by the absence of extracellular $Na^+$; it is limited indirectly by reduced choline.\n- D: Incorrect. AChE continues to hydrolyze ACh; degradation is not blocked, so ACh will not accumulate.\n- E: Incorrect. The CHT does not reverse to pump choline out in the absence of extracellular $Na^+$; without $Na^+$ binding, transport ceases rather than reverses.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is inhibited choline reuptake leading to decreased ACh synthesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2326225"}, {"introduction": "After synthesis in the cytoplasm, acetylcholine must be highly concentrated into synaptic vesicles to prepare for quantal release. This exercise challenges you to quantify the remarkable power of this loading mechanism, which works against a steep concentration gradient.

This process is mediated by the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), which operates as an antiporter. The energy for this transport is provided by a proton electrochemical gradient maintained by a V-type H+-ATPase (proton pump) in the vesicle membrane. This pump hydrolyzes ATP to actively transport protons (H+) into the vesicle, creating both a pH gradient and an electrical potential difference across the vesicular membrane.

Now, consider the application of a novel experimental drug that completely and specifically inhibits the V-type H+-ATPase proton pump. After the application of this drug, the system is allowed to reach a new steady state where the proton gradient and the membrane potential across the vesicle have fully dissipated (i.e., the pH and electrical potential differences across the membrane become zero).\n\nAssuming the concentration of acetylcholine in the cytosol remains constant throughout the experiment, calculate the ratio of the steady-state intra-vesicular acetylcholine concentration *after* the inhibitor's action to the concentration *before* the inhibitor was added.\n\nUse the following constants:\nFaraday constant, $F = 96,485 \\text{ C/mol}$\nIdeal gas constant, $R = 8.314 \\text{ J/(mol}\\cdot\\text{K)}$\n\nExpress your answer as a single real number rounded to two significant figures.
