{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Neuropeptides exert powerful and lasting effects on neural circuits, but they begin their existence as large, inactive precursor molecules called prohormones. A critical step in their life cycle is enzymatic processing within dense-core vesicles, where prohormone convertases cleave these precursors into their final, biologically active forms. This exercise [@problem_id:2333819] challenges you to predict the functional consequences of a failure in this essential maturation step, highlighting why proper processing is indispensable for neuropeptide signaling.", "problem": "In the field of cellular neuroscience, the synthesis and release of neuropeptides are critical for long-term modulation of neural circuits. These peptides are first synthesized on ribosomes as large, inactive precursor proteins called preprohormones. After the signal peptide is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum, the resulting prohormone is transported to the Golgi apparatus and packaged into large dense-core vesicles (DCVs). Within these vesicles, specific enzymes known as prohormone convertases cleave the prohormone into smaller, biologically active neuropeptides.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in which a neuroscientist is culturing a line of neurons that harbor a specific genetic mutation. This mutation results in the complete loss of function of all prohormone convertase enzymes within the cells. The synthesis of prohormones and their packaging into DCVs remain otherwise unaffected. When these neurons are stimulated to release the contents of their DCVs, what is the most direct and significant consequence for the biological activity of the secreted peptide products?\n\nA. The neuropeptides will be correctly processed but will be immediately degraded in the synaptic cleft, preventing any downstream signaling.\n\nB. The synthesis of prohormone precursors will be inhibited at the level of the ribosome, so no peptide products will be released.\n\nC. The neuropeptides will be released in their large, uncleaved prohormone form, rendering them biologically inactive at their target receptors.\n\nD. The neuropeptides will be sequestered within the dense-core vesicles and cannot be released, even with strong neuronal stimulation.\n\nE. The lack of cleavage will cause the neuropeptides to become misfolded, leading to an unfolded protein response and cell death.", "solution": "We identify the normal biosynthetic pathway for neuropeptides: ribosomal synthesis of preprohormones, signal peptide cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum to generate prohormones, trafficking to the Golgi and packaging into large dense-core vesicles (DCVs), followed by intravesicular enzymatic cleavage by prohormone convertases (e.g., PC1/3, PC2) to generate biologically active peptides, often with additional processing such as carboxypeptidase trimming and amidation that require prior convertase cleavage.\n\nGiven the mutation causes complete loss of function of all prohormone convertases, the necessary intravesicular cleavage step does not occur. The problem states that prohormone synthesis and DCV packaging are otherwise unaffected, so prohormones still enter DCVs and DCVs can be released upon stimulation. Therefore, upon exocytosis, the secreted peptide products will predominantly be uncleaved prohormone forms. Because receptor recognition and activation generally require the correctly processed peptide sequence and termini generated by convertase cleavage (and often subsequent modifications that depend on cleavage), these uncleaved prohormones will be biologically inactive at their target receptors.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A is incorrect because correct processing does not occur in the absence of convertases; degradation in the synaptic cleft is not the primary issue.\n- B is incorrect because ribosomal synthesis is stated to be unaffected.\n- C is correct: uncleaved prohormones are released and are inactive.\n- D is incorrect because vesicle release machinery is intact and secretion upon stimulation still occurs.\n- E is not the direct and necessary consequence; prohormones can fold without convertase cleavage, and the primary effect on signaling is loss of activity due to lack of processing.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and significant consequence is release of inactive, uncleaved prohormones.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2333819"}, {"introduction": "Once synthesized and packaged in the cell body, neuropeptide-filled dense-core vesicles must embark on a long journey down the axon to reach their release sites. Neuroscientists visualize this remarkable process of axonal transport using live-cell imaging, often analyzing the movement with a technique called kymography.

To visualize this process, they genetically engineer a DNA construct where the neuropeptide's precursor, known as a propeptide, is fused to a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). When this construct is expressed in cultured neurons, the propeptide is synthesized and packaged into organelles called Dense-Core Vesicles (DCVs) in the neuron's cell body, rendering these vesicles fluorescent.\n\nThe scientist then performs live-cell microscopy on a neuron expressing the fusion protein, recording a time-lapse movie of a single axon. To quantify the movement of the fluorescent DCVs, a kymograph is generated from the movie. A kymograph is an image that represents spatial position along a one-dimensional line (in this case, the axon) over time. For this experiment, the kymograph was constructed by plotting the pixel intensity along a 100-micrometer segment of the axon (represented on the vertical axis) against the progression of time (represented on the horizontal axis).\n\nThe final kymograph image has a height of 800 pixels (the spatial dimension) and a width of 1200 pixels (the temporal dimension). The total duration of the time-lapse recording corresponds to the full width of the kymograph and is 60 seconds. On this kymograph, the paths of individual DCVs moving from the cell body towards the axon terminal (a process called anterograde transport) appear as bright, straight diagonal lines. A typical track for a single DCV is analyzed and found to span the entire height of the kymograph, starting at the top (spatial pixel 0) and ending at the bottom (spatial pixel 800). The horizontal (temporal) extent of this same track is measured to be 1000 pixels.\n\nAssuming the vesicle maintains a constant velocity, calculate the average anterograde transport velocity of these DCVs.

The release of Orexin is critical for regulating arousal and wakefulness. Through a series of electrophysiological and imaging experiments, the biologist develops a simple mathematical model describing the steady-state release rate of DCVs, denoted by $R$, as a function of sustained presynaptic action potential frequency, $f_{AP}$.\n\nThe proposed model is given by:\n$$ R(f_{AP}) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } f_{AP} \\le f_{th} \\\\ R_{max} \\frac{f_{AP} - f_{th}}{K_{freq} + (f_{AP} - f_{th})} & \\text{if } f_{AP} > f_{th} \\end{cases} $$\n\nHere, all frequencies are in units of Hertz (Hz), and the release rate is in vesicles per second.
