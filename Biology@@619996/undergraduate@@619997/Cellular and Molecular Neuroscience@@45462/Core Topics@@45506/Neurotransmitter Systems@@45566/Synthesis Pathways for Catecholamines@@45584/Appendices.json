They are using a specially engineered line of non-neuronal cells. This cell line has been genetically modified to express high levels of the enzyme Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). However, the genetic modification protocol ensures that this cell line completely lacks a functional gene for the enzyme Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH).\n\nThe canonical biosynthetic pathway for dopamine in the nervous system proceeds in two steps:\n1. Tyrosine is converted into L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) by the enzyme Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH).\n2. L-DOPA is then converted into dopamine by the enzyme Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC).\n\nIn the experiment, the engineered cells are placed in a culture medium that is rich in L-DOPA. It is confirmed that the cells are capable of actively transporting this external L-DOPA across their cell membranes into the cytoplasm.\n\nBased on this information about the cell's enzymatic machinery and the experimental conditions, which of the following outcomes is the most likely?\n\nA. The cells will not produce dopamine because Tyrosine Hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme for the pathway, and its absence prevents all synthesis.\n\nB. The cells will begin to synthesize dopamine using the L-DOPA provided in the medium.\n\nC.

The cells will take up L-DOPA, but the Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase enzyme will be unable to act on it in a non-neuronal cell type.", "solution": "- Canonical pathway logic:\n  - In neurons, tyrosine is first hydroxylated to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) by Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), then L-DOPA is decarboxylated to dopamine by Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC).\n  - TH is the rate-limiting step for de novo synthesis from tyrosine. However, supplying L-DOPA externally bypasses the need for TH, because the substrate for AADC is directly provided.\n\n- Experimental setup implications:\n  - The engineered cells lack functional TH, so they cannot convert tyrosine to L-DOPA internally.\n  - The medium is rich in L-DOPA, and the cells transport L-DOPA into the cytoplasm; thus, the intracellular substrate for AADC is available.\n  - The cells express high levels of AADC. AADC catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-DOPA to dopamine and requires pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor, not TH. Therefore, TH is not necessary for AADC activity when L-DOPA is present.\n\n- Evaluation of options:\n  - Option A is incorrect because the absence of TH blocks only the tyrosine-to-L-DOPA step. Exogenous L-DOPA circumvents this block, allowing dopamine synthesis by AADC.\n  - Option C is incorrect because TH is not a stabilizing cofactor for AADC; AADC functions independently of TH with pyridoxal phosphate as its cofactor.\n  - Option D is incorrect because conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine requires dopamine beta-hydroxylase, an enzyme not stated to be present and typically localized to vesicles in catecholaminergic cells; non-neuronal engineered cells expressing only AADC would not carry out this step.\n  - Option E is incorrect because AADC is a cytosolic enzyme that can function in non-neuronal cells; its activity depends on enzyme presence and substrate availability, not neuronal identity.\n\n- Conclusion:\n  - With L-DOPA supplied and AADC present, the most likely outcome is dopamine synthesis from L-DOPA.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2352223"}, {"introduction": "Neurotransmitter synthesis is not just a simple chemical sequence; it is a beautifully orchestrated process that occurs in specific locations within the neuron.
