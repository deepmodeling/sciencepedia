{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the effect of a neurotransmitter begins with the concept of electrochemical driving force. This force, the difference between the membrane potential ($V_m$) and an ion's equilibrium potential ($E_{\\text{ion}}$), dictates the direction of ion flow when a channel opens.

This neuron receives an inhibitory synaptic input from a nearby interneuron that releases the neurotransmitter glycine. Glycine binds to postsynaptic receptors that are ligand-gated ion channels selectively permeable to chloride ions ($\\text{Cl}^-$).

Glycine opens ligand-gated channels that are selectively permeable to $\\text{Cl}^{-}$, increasing the chloride conductance $g_{\\text{Cl}}$.\n\nRelevant principle: when an ion channel opens, the membrane current for that ion is given by an Ohm's law form:\n$$\nI_{\\text{Cl}}=g_{\\text{Cl}}\\left(V_{m}-E_{\\text{Cl}}\\right).\n$$\nOpening the channels increases $g_{\\text{Cl}}$.

The inward movement of $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ions adds negative charge inside the cell, making $V_{m}$ more negative.\n\nAnother equivalent statement: increasing $g_{\\text{Cl}}$ forces $V_{m}$ to move toward $E_{\\text{Cl}}$.

A single, discrete channel opening event is observed to produce a steady current. The magnitude of this current is measured to be 0.60 pA.
