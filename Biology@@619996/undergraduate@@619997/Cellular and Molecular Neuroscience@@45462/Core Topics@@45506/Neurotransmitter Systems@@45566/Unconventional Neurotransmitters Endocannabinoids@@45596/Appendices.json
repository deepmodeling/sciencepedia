This practice will solidify your understanding of the critical role that postsynaptic calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) plays in initiating this unique form of synaptic communication, a phenomenon known as Depolarization-induced Suppression of Excitation (DSE) [@problem_id:2354302].", "problem": "A researcher is investigating the mechanism of synaptic plasticity at an excitatory synapse in the hippocampus. The presynaptic neuron releases glutamate, and the postsynaptic neuron responds. The researcher observes a phenomenon called Depolarization-induced Suppression of Excitation (DSE), where a brief, strong depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron causes a temporary reduction in glutamate release from the presynaptic terminal.\n\nThe hypothesis is that this DSE is caused by the release of retrograde messengers called endocannabinoids from the postsynaptic neuron. This release is thought to be triggered by an increase in intracellular calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) concentration within the postsynaptic neuron.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the researcher performs the following experiment and records the amount of glutamate released by a single presynaptic action potential under different conditions:\n\n1.  **Baseline Condition:** The amount of glutamate released is measured and established as a 100% baseline level.\n2.  **DSE Condition:** The postsynaptic neuron is depolarized from its resting potential to 0 mV for 5 seconds to induce DSE. Immediately following this depolarization, the glutamate release is measured and found to be 25% of the baseline level.\n3.  **Chelator Condition:** The experiment is repeated. This time, the postsynaptic neuron is first filled with BAPTA, a molecule that rapidly binds to and inactivates free $Ca^{2+}$ ions (a calcium chelator). Then, the same 5-second depolarization protocol is applied to the postsynaptic neuron. The glutamate release is measured immediately after.\n\nAssuming the hypothesis is correct and that BAPTA is 100% effective at preventing a rise in intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration, which of the following values best represents the expected glutamate release in the Chelator Condition, expressed as a percentage of the baseline level?\n\nA. 10%\n\nB. 25%\n\nC. 50%\n\nD. 100%\n\nE. 150%", "solution": "The problem requires us to predict the outcome of an experiment designed to test a specific hypothesis about the mechanism of Depolarization-induced Suppression of Excitation (DSE).\n\nFirst, let's break down the proposed causal pathway for DSE based on the hypothesis provided:\n1.  A strong depolarization is applied to the postsynaptic neuron.\n2.  This depolarization causes a large influx of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) into the postsynaptic neuron, leading to a significant increase in its intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration.\n3.  The elevated postsynaptic $Ca^{2+}$ concentration triggers the synthesis and release of endocannabinoids.\n4.  These endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers; they travel \"backwards\" from the postsynaptic neuron to the presynaptic terminal.\n5.  At the presynaptic terminal, endocannabinoids bind to their receptors (e.g., CB1 receptors), which initiates a signaling cascade that inhibits the machinery for neurotransmitter release.\n6.  The result is a suppression of glutamate release from the presynaptic neuron, which is the phenomenon of DSE.\n\nThe experimental data provides key reference points. The Baseline Condition establishes the normal (100%) level of glutamate release. The DSE Condition confirms the effectiveness of the depolarization protocol; it activates the entire hypothetical pathway, resulting in glutamate release being suppressed to 25% of the baseline.\n\nNow, consider the Chelator Condition. In this condition, the postsynaptic neuron is loaded with BAPTA. BAPTA is a calcium chelator, meaning it binds very quickly and tightly to free $Ca^{2+}$ ions. The problem specifies that BAPTA is 100% effective at preventing a rise in intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration.\n\nWhen the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized in the presence of BAPTA, $Ca^{2+}$ ions may still enter the cell through voltage-gated channels or NMDA receptors. However, BAPTA will immediately sequester these ions, preventing the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ from rising.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, the rise in postsynaptic $Ca^{2+}$ (Step 2) is the critical trigger for the synthesis and release of endocannabinoids (Step 3). By preventing this rise, BAPTA effectively breaks the causal chain at this crucial point. If Step 2 does not occur, then Step 3 (endocannabinoid release), Step 4 (retrograde signaling), and Step 5 (presynaptic inhibition) will not happen.\n\nTherefore, despite the postsynaptic depolarization, no inhibitory retrograde signal will be sent to the presynaptic terminal. The presynaptic terminal will not \"know\" that the postsynaptic cell was depolarized, and its glutamate release mechanism will remain uninhibited. Consequently, the amount of glutamate released should be the same as it was before the depolarization was applied, which is the baseline level.\n\nThe baseline level of glutamate release was defined as 100%. Thus, in the Chelator Condition, the expected glutamate release is 100% of the baseline level.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA. 10% would imply an enhancement of DSE.\nB. 25% would imply that BAPTA has no effect on DSE.\nC. 50% would imply a partial block of DSE.\nD. 100% represents a complete block of DSE, restoring release to the baseline level, which matches our reasoning.\nE. 150% would imply a potentiation of release beyond the baseline, for which there is no described mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2354302"}, {"introduction": "Just as important as turning a signal on is the ability to turn it off.
