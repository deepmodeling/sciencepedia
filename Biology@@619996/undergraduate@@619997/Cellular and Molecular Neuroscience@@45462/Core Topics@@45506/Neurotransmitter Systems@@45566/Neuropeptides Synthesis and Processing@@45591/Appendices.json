This exercise explores the critical process of axonal transport, the cellular logistics network responsible for this delivery. By considering a hypothetical scenario where a key molecular motor is inhibited, you can practice predicting the large-scale consequences of a nanoscale disruption, solidifying your understanding of the directed movement of vesicles along the neuron's microtubule \"highways\" [@problem_id:2345996].", "problem": "In a typical neuron, neuropeptides are synthesized as larger precursor proteins on ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cell body (soma). These precursors are then processed and packaged into specialized vesicles known as Dense-Core Vesicles (DCVs) by the Golgi apparatus, also located in the soma. These vesicles must then be transported to their release sites, which are often at the axon terminal. Consider an experiment where a mature, healthy neuron in culture is treated with a novel pharmacological agent that selectively and completely inhibits the function of all kinesin motor proteins. The agent has no effect on dynein motors, myosin motors, or the process of vesicle exocytosis. After several hours of this treatment, where would you expect to find the highest concentration of newly synthesized DCVs?\n\nA. Primarily accumulated at the axon terminal.\n\nB. Primarily accumulated within the cell body (soma).\n\nC. Evenly distributed along the entire length of the axon.\n\nD. Primarily accumulated in the dendrites.\n\nE. Primarily found within lysosomes following degradation.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the location of newly synthesized Dense-Core Vesicles (DCVs) in a neuron where the motor protein kinesin is inhibited. To solve this, we must trace the normal pathway of DCV synthesis and transport and then consider the effect of the inhibition.\n\nStep 1: Understand the synthesis and packaging of neuropeptides.\nAs stated in the problem, neuropeptides are synthesized in the cell body (soma). The process involves transcription of the gene in the nucleus, translation of the messenger RNA on ribosomes attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and subsequent processing and packaging into DCVs by the Golgi apparatus. This entire manufacturing process occurs within the soma.\n\nStep 2: Understand the transport of DCVs.\nOnce packaged, DCVs must be moved from the soma to their sites of release, typically the axon terminal. This long-distance movement is an active process called axonal transport, which occurs along microtubule tracks that run the length of the axon.\n\nStep 3: Identify the roles of specific motor proteins.\nAxonal transport is mediated by motor proteins that use Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to \"walk\" along microtubules.\n- **Kinesin** is the primary motor protein responsible for **anterograde transport**, which is the movement of cargo *away* from the cell body and *towards* the axon terminal (i.e., from the minus-end to the plus-end of the microtubules).\n- **Dynein** is the primary motor protein responsible for **retrograde transport**, which is the movement of cargo *towards* the cell body *from* the axon terminal.\n\nStep 4: Apply the experimental condition.\nThe problem states that a pharmacological agent has selectively and completely inhibited kinesin. This means that anterograde transport is blocked. Newly synthesized DCVs, which are produced in the soma, rely on kinesin to be transported down the axon to the terminal.\n\nStep 5: Deduce the consequence of the inhibition.\nSince the \"outward\" transport mechanism (anterograde transport via kinesin) is disabled, the DCVs that are continuously being produced in the soma have no way to leave it. They cannot be transported down the axon. As a result, they will accumulate at their site of synthesis.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. Primarily accumulated at the axon terminal: This is incorrect. To reach the axon terminal, DCVs require anterograde transport, which is precisely what has been blocked.\n- B. Primarily accumulated within the cell body (soma): This is correct. The DCVs are produced in the soma and cannot be transported out, leading to their accumulation there.\n- C. Evenly distributed along the entire length of the axon: This is incorrect. An even distribution would imply that transport is occurring normally or that the vesicles are freely diffusing, neither of which is the case. The block in transport will prevent them from entering the axon in the first place.\n- D. Primarily accumulated in the dendrites: This is incorrect. While some DCVs might be targeted to dendrites, the primary site of synthesis is the soma, and the block on kinesin-mediated transport would cause them to bottleneck there before they could be distributed anywhere else. The most significant accumulation will be in the soma.\n- E. Primarily found within lysosomes following degradation: This is incorrect. The problem gives no information to suggest that a failure to transport triggers immediate degradation. While vesicles may eventually be degraded, the primary and immediate effect of the transport block is accumulation, not degradation.\n\nTherefore, the highest concentration of newly synthesized DCVs will be found in the cell body (soma).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2345996"}, {"introduction": "A newly synthesized neuropeptide precursor is like a rough draft that needs significant editing to become a final, functional molecule. This \"editing\" involves a precise sequence of enzymatic cuts and modifications that occur in different cellular compartments as the peptide travels through the secretory pathway. This problem challenges you to act as a molecular detective, deducing the final structure of a neuropeptide when one of the key processing enzymes is misplaced, highlighting the critical importance of both the right enzymes and the right location for their activity [@problem_id:2345955].", "problem": "In a specific peptidergic neuron, a neuropeptide called \"somnoregulin\" is synthesized as part of a larger precursor protein, preprosomnoregulin. The synthesis and processing of this precursor follow the canonical secretory pathway. The amino acid sequence of the relevant segment of the pro-protein (after signal peptide removal in the endoplasmic reticulum) is given in standard one-letter code as:\n\n`Pro-Gln-Glu-Lys-Arg-Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly-Lys-Lys-Ser-Asp-Phe`\n\nThe processing of this pro-protein into the final, biologically active somnoregulin peptide involves several enzymatic steps that occur in specific cellular compartments:\n\n1.  **Prohormone Convertases (PCs):** These endopeptidases are packaged into immature secretory granules along with the pro-protein. They become active as the granule acidifies and cleave the pro-protein on the C-terminal side of paired basic residues (e.g., `Lys-Arg`, `Lys-Lys`).\n2.  **Carboxypeptidase E (CPE):** This exopeptidase is also packaged into secretory granules. It functions in the acidic environment of the granules to sequentially remove the basic residues (Lysine, Arginine) from the C-terminus of peptides cleaved by PCs.\n3.  **Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM):** This enzyme, located in secretory granules, catalyzes the C-terminal amidation of peptides that have a glycine residue at their C-terminus after processing by PCs and CPE. This amidation reaction is crucial for the biological activity of many neuropeptides.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered neuronal cell line in which a mutation in the gene for CPE causes the enzyme to be incorrectly sorted. Instead of being packaged into secretory granules, the mutant CPE is retained within the cis-Golgi network. Assume the pH of the cis-Golgi is approximately 6.7, rendering CPE essentially inactive, while the pH of the secretory granules drops to 6.0, where PCs and PAM are fully active. All other proteins and pathways function normally.\n\nGiven this specific mutation, which of the following represents the final chemical structure of the primary somnoregulin-related peptide that will be secreted from the neuron? (Assume `-NH2` denotes a C-terminal amide group).\n\nA. `Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly-Lys-Lys`\n\nB. `Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly`\n\nC. `Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-NH2`\n\nD. `Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly-NH2`\n\nE. `Pro-Gln-Glu-Lys-Arg-Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly-Lys-Lys-Ser-Asp-Phe`", "solution": "To determine the final peptide structure, we must trace the processing steps under both normal and mutant conditions, based on the rules provided in the problem.\n\n**1. Normal Processing Pathway:**\n\n*   **Step A: Prohormone Convertase (PC) Cleavage:** The pro-protein is `...Lys-Arg-Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly-Lys-Lys-Ser...`. The problem states PCs cleave on the C-terminal side of paired basic residues. This means the PCs make two cuts: one after `Lys-Arg` and one after `Lys-Lys`. This liberates the peptide fragment that was between these sites. Crucially, for the subsequent enzyme (CPE) to have a substrate, this initial cleavage must produce a peptide with basic residues at its C-terminus. Thus, the intermediate peptide generated by PC action is `Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly-Lys-Lys`.\n\n*   **Step B: Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) Action:** CPE is an exopeptidase that removes C-terminal basic residues. It acts on the intermediate from Step A, sequentially removing the two Lysine residues (`Lys-Lys`) from the C-terminus. This produces the peptide: `Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly`.\n\n*   **Step C: PAM Amidation:** The peptide now has a Glycine at its C-terminus. The PAM enzyme recognizes this, removes the Glycine, and converts the new C-terminal Proline's carboxyl group into an amide group. The final, active, and amidated peptide is `Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-NH2`.\n\n**2. Mutant Processing Pathway:**\n\n*   **The Condition:** In the mutant neuron, CPE is mis-sorted and is not present in the secretory granules where processing occurs. PCs and PAM are still present and active in the granules.\n\n*   **Step A: Prohormone Convertase (PC) Cleavage:** This step is unaffected. The PCs are active in the granules and still cleave the pro-protein to produce the intermediate peptide: `Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly-Lys-Lys`.\n\n*   **Step B: Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) Action:** This step fails to occur. Because CPE is absent from the secretory granules, the two C-terminal Lysine residues are not removed from the peptide.\n\n*   **Step C: PAM Amidation:** The PAM enzyme is present and active, but its substrate must have a Glycine at the C-terminus. The peptide in the mutant neuron still has `Lys-Lys` at its C-terminus. Since this is not a substrate for PAM, no amidation occurs.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The processing pathway is arrested after the initial PC cleavage. The final peptide secreted from the mutant neuron is `Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly-Lys-Lys`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2345955"}, {"introduction": "Biological processes are not just about what happens, but also about *how fast* it happens.
