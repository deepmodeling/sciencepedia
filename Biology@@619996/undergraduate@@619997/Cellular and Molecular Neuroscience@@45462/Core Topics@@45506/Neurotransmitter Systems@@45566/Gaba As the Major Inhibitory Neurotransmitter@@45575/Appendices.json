This exercise [@problem_id:2336533] challenges you to predict the movement of chloride ions by comparing the neuron's membrane potential to the chloride equilibrium potential. Mastering this concept is the first step toward understanding the nuanced effects of synaptic transmission.", "problem": "In the mature central nervous system, Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. It exerts its effect primarily by binding to $GABA_A$ receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels permeable to chloride ions (Cl-).\n\nConsider a typical postsynaptic neuron where the equilibrium potential for chloride ions ($E_{Cl^{-}}$) is -70 mV. A neurophysiologist conducts an experiment using the voltage-clamp technique, which allows them to set and maintain the neuron's membrane potential ($V_m$) at any desired value. In this experiment, the neuron's membrane potential is clamped at -85 mV. While clamped, a solution containing GABA is applied to the neuron, causing the $GABA_A$ receptor channels to open.\n\nBy convention, an 'inward current' corresponds to the net movement of positive charge into the cell (or, equivalently, negative charge out of the cell), while an 'outward current' corresponds to the net movement of positive charge out of the cell (or negative charge into the cell).\n\nWhen the $GABA_A$ channels open under these specific voltage-clamp conditions, what will be the resulting net direction of chloride ion flow and the direction of the electrical current measured by the voltage-clamp amplifier?\n\nA. Chloride ions will flow into the cell, resulting in an outward current.\nB. Chloride ions will flow out of the cell, resulting in an inward current.\nC. Chloride ions will flow out of the cell, resulting in an outward current.\nD. Chloride ions will flow into the cell, resulting in an inward current.\nE. There will be no net flow of chloride ions, and thus no current.", "solution": "We identify the relevant physical principle: for an ion-selective conductance with reversal (equilibrium) potential $E_{\\text{ion}}$, the membrane current through that conductance under voltage clamp is given by\n$$\nI_{\\text{ion}} = g_{\\text{ion}}\\left(V_{m} - E_{\\text{ion}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $I_{\\text{ion}}$ is positive for an outward current (net positive charge leaving the cell) and negative for an inward current (net positive charge entering the cell). For a chloride-selective $GABA_A$ conductance, $E_{\\text{ion}} = E_{Cl^{-}}$.\n\nGiven $E_{Cl^{-}} = -70\\ \\text{mV}$ and $V_{m} = -85\\ \\text{mV}$, the driving force is\n$$\nV_{m} - E_{Cl^{-}} = \\left(-85\\ \\text{mV}\\right) - \\left(-70\\ \\text{mV}\\right) = -15\\ \\text{mV}.\n$$\nThus\n$$\nI_{Cl^{-}} = g_{Cl^{-}}\\left(V_{m} - E_{Cl^{-}}\\right) = g_{Cl^{-}}\\left(-15\\ \\text{mV}\\right) < 0,\n$$\nwhich, by the standard convention stated, is an inward current.\n\nNext, relate current direction to ion flux for an anion. By the stated convention, an inward current corresponds to either positive charge entering the cell or negative charge leaving the cell. Since the permeant ion is $Cl^{-}$ (negative), an inward current through $GABA_A$ channels corresponds to $Cl^{-}$ ions flowing out of the cell (negative charge exiting).\n\nA consistency check with reversal potential reasoning: because $V_{m} < E_{Cl^{-}}$, opening $Cl^{-}$ channels will tend to drive the membrane potential toward $E_{Cl^{-}}$, i.e., make it less negative. This requires loss of negative charge from the cell, i.e., $Cl^{-}$ efflux, which matches the conclusion above. Under voltage clamp, the amplifier measures this as an inward current.\n\nTherefore, upon opening $GABA_A$ channels at $V_{m} = -85\\ \\text{mV}$ with $E_{Cl^{-}} = -70\\ \\text{mV}$, chloride ions flow out of the cell and the measured current is inward.\n\nThe correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2336533"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of driving force, this next practice explores the quantitative impact of $GABA_A$ receptor activation on the neuronal membrane potential.
