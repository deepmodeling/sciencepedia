This fundamental exercise challenges you to work like a neuropharmacologist, interpreting experimental data to deduce the receptor type present on a neuron. By analyzing the change in $cAMP$ levels after dopamine application, you will practice applying the core principle that links receptor families to their downstream G-protein signaling pathways. [@problem_id:2334593]", "problem": "A neuropharmacology team is investigating the signaling properties of a specific population of neurons isolated from a mammalian central nervous system structure. Dopamine, a critical neurotransmitter, is known to exert its effects by binding to two major families of receptors: the D1-like family (comprising D1 and D5 subtypes) and the D2-like family (comprising D2, D3, and D4 subtypes). These receptors are known to modulate the intracellular concentration of a key second messenger, cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), which is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase.\n\nIn an experiment, the research team places the cultured neurons in a physiological buffer. After establishing a baseline, they introduce dopamine into the buffer. Following the application of dopamine, they lyse the cells and measure the intracellular concentration of cAMP. Their results show a robust and significant increase in the concentration of intracellular cAMP compared to the baseline level.\n\nBased solely on this experimental outcome, what is the most likely conclusion about the dopamine receptors expressed by these neurons?\n\nA. The neurons predominantly express receptors of the D1-like family.\n\nB. The neurons predominantly express receptors of the D2-like family.\n\nC. The neurons express both D1-like and D2-like receptors in functionally equal amounts.\n\nD. The neurons do not express dopamine receptors that couple to the adenylyl cyclase pathway.\n\nE. The experiment is insufficient to differentiate between the D1-like and D2-like receptor families.", "solution": "We denote the intracellular cAMP concentration before dopamine as $[cAMP]_{0}$ and after dopamine application as $[cAMP]_{DA}$. The experiment reports $[cAMP]_{DA} > [cAMP]_{0}$, i.e., a robust and significant increase in intracellular cAMP upon dopamine exposure.\n\nAdenylyl cyclase synthesizes cAMP from ATP, and its activity is regulated by G protein signaling:\n- D1-like dopamine receptors (D1, D5) couple to $G_{s}$, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity. Symbolically, if $A_{AC}$ denotes adenylyl cyclase activity at baseline, D1-like activation produces $A_{AC} \\to A_{AC} + \\Delta A_{+}$ with $\\Delta A_{+} > 0$, leading to an increase in cAMP.\n- D2-like dopamine receptors (D2, D3, D4) couple to $G_{i/o}$, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. This yields $A_{AC} \\to A_{AC} - \\Delta A_{-}$ with $\\Delta A_{-} > 0$, leading to a decrease in cAMP.\n\nThe observed inequality $[cAMP]_{DA} > [cAMP]_{0}$ implies a net stimulatory effect on adenylyl cyclase:\n$$\n\\Delta A_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta A_{+} - \\Delta A_{-} > 0.\n$$\nA robust increase indicates $\\Delta A_{+} \\gg \\Delta A_{-}$, which is most consistent with predominant expression of D1-like receptors. If D2-like receptors predominated, one would expect $[cAMP]_{DA} < [cAMP]_{0}$. If both families were expressed in functionally equal amounts, the net effect would be small or ambiguous rather than a robust increase. Therefore, the data support that these neurons predominantly express D1-like receptors. The experiment is sufficient to distinguish directionality (stimulation versus inhibition of adenylyl cyclase), so it is not insufficient in this context.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2334593"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand how dopamine receptors work, we must appreciate their modular design, where different parts of the protein perform distinct functions. This thought experiment explores the consequences of creating a \"chimeric\" receptor, a powerful technique in molecular neuroscience used to map structure to function. By predicting the signaling output of a receptor with a swapped G-protein coupling domain, you will solidify your understanding of how ligand binding is distinct from downstream signal transduction specificity. [@problem_id:2334585]", "problem": "In cellular neuroscience, dopamine receptors, a class of G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), are essential for modulating neuronal signaling. They are broadly categorized into two families with opposing effects on the intracellular second messenger, cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nThe D1-like receptor family (e.g., D1 receptor) typically couples to a stimulatory G-protein, Gs. Upon agonist binding, the activated Gs protein stimulates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, resulting in an increase in intracellular cAMP concentration.\n\nConversely, the D2-like receptor family (e.g., D2 receptor) normally couples to an inhibitory G-protein, Gi. Upon agonist binding, the activated Gi protein inhibits adenylyl cyclase, leading to a decrease in intracellular cAMP concentration.\n\nThe specificity of coupling to either Gs or Gi is largely determined by the structure of the receptor's intracellular domains, particularly the third intracellular loop (i3 loop). The ligand binding pocket, however, is formed by the transmembrane helices.\n\nA molecular biologist creates a chimeric receptor. This new receptor is constructed using the full protein sequence of the D1 receptor, but its native third intracellular loop has been replaced with the corresponding third intracellular loop from a D2 receptor. This chimeric receptor is expressed in a cell line that endogenously contains adenylyl cyclase, Gs, and Gi proteins.\n\nWhen dopamine is applied to these cells, what is the expected immediate effect on the activity of adenylyl cyclase?\n\nA. Strong activation of adenylyl cyclase.\n\nB. Strong inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.\n\nC. No change in adenylyl cyclase activity.\n\nD. The receptor will be unable to bind dopamine.\n\nE.

D1-like receptors normally couple to $G_{s}$, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase and increases intracellular $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$. D2-like receptors normally couple to $G_{i}$, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase and decreases intracellular $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$. The specificity for $G$-protein coupling is determined primarily by intracellular domains, particularly the third intracellular loop (i3 loop), while ligand binding is mediated by the transmembrane helices forming the ligand binding pocket.\n\nThe chimeric receptor is constructed from the full D1 receptor sequence but with its native i3 loop replaced by the corresponding i3 loop from a D2 receptor. Therefore:\n- The ligand binding pocket is D1-like (formed by D1 transmembrane helices), so dopamine will still bind effectively; option D is excluded.\n- The G-protein coupling domain (i3 loop) is D2-like, so the receptor will preferentially couple to $G_{i}$ rather than $G_{s}$ upon activation by dopamine.\n\nGiven that the cell expresses endogenous adenylyl cyclase, $G_{s}$, and $G_{i}$, activation of the chimeric receptor by dopamine will engage $G_{i}$. The immediate signaling consequence of $G_{i}$ activation is inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, leading to a decrease in the rate of conversion of ATP to cAMP. Thus the immediate effect on adenylyl cyclase is inhibition. This excludes options A (which requires $G_{s}$ coupling), C (since signaling does occur), and E (no switch to a phospholipase C pathway is implied by this construct).\n\nTherefore, the expected immediate effect is strong inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2334585"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative concepts to quantitative predictions is a key step in mastering cellular neuroscience.
