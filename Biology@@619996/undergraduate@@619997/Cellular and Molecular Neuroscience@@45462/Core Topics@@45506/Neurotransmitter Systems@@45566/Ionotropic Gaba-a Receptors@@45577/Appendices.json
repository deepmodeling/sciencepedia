This has profound implications for the action of gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain.\n\nConsider a single neuron isolated from a developing embryonic brain slice. This neuron is observed to have a stable resting membrane potential of $V_{rest} = -60$ mV. Due to the high internal chloride concentration, the Nernst potential for chloride, which acts as the reversal potential for pure chloride channels, is measured to be $E_{Cl} = -50$ mV.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where a puff of GABA is applied to the neuron's soma, causing a large number of its ionotropic GABA-A receptors to open. These GABA-A receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that are almost exclusively permeable to $Cl^-$ ions.\n\nWhich of the following terms best describes the immediate change in the neuron's membrane potential upon the opening of these GABA-A channels?\n\nA. Depolarization\n\nB. Hyperpolarization\n\nC. Shunting Inhibition\n\nD. No change in membrane potential", "solution": "GABA-A receptors are ligand-gated channels that increase chloride conductance, so their opening adds a membrane current governed by Ohm’s law for a single ionic species:\n$$\nI_{Cl} = g_{Cl}\\left(V_{m} - E_{Cl}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $g_{Cl}$ is the chloride conductance, $V_{m}$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{Cl}$ is the chloride reversal potential.\n\nThe membrane voltage dynamics satisfy the current balance (using the standard sign convention where positive current is outward positive charge):\n$$\nC \\frac{dV_{m}}{dt} = -\\sum I_{i}.\n$$\nIf the GABA-A conductance dominates immediately after channel opening, the leading contribution is\n$$\nC \\frac{dV_{m}}{dt} \\approx - I_{Cl} = - g_{Cl}\\left(V_{m} - E_{Cl}\\right).\n$$\nEvaluated at the instant of channel opening when $V_{m} = V_{rest}$,\n$$\nC \\frac{dV_{m}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = - g_{Cl}\\left(V_{rest} - E_{Cl}\\right).\n$$\nThe sign of the initial voltage change is therefore determined by the sign of $-\\left(V_{rest} - E_{Cl}\\right)$. Given that $V_{rest} < E_{Cl}$ (because $V_{rest} = -60\\,\\text{mV}$ and $E_{Cl} = -50\\,\\text{mV}$), it follows that $V_{rest} - E_{Cl} < 0$, hence\n$$\nI_{Cl} = g_{Cl}\\left(V_{rest} - E_{Cl}\\right) < 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -I_{Cl} > 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{dV_{m}}{dt} > 0.\n$$\nThus, immediately after GABA-A channel opening, $V_{m}$ increases toward $E_{Cl}$, which is a depolarization. In steady state with large $g_{Cl}$, $V_{m} \\to E_{Cl}$, also confirming a depolarizing shift because $E_{Cl}$ is more positive than $V_{rest}$.\n\nFor completeness: hyperpolarization would require $E_{Cl} < V_{rest}$; no change would require $E_{Cl} = V_{rest}$. “Shunting inhibition” refers to the reduction of input resistance and divisive effect on synaptic potentials due to increased conductance, not the immediate direction of voltage change.

The researcher performs a series of patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments on a neuron expressing these receptors.\n\nIn the first experiment, applying a standard concentration of GABA to the neuron reliably elicits an inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) due to the influx of chloride ions.\n\nIn the second experiment, the researcher co-applies the same standard concentration of GABA along with a molecule called bicuculline. The magnitude of the resulting IPSC is significantly reduced. However, when the researcher dramatically increases the concentration of GABA while keeping the bicuculline concentration constant, the IPSC magnitude is restored to the level seen in the first experiment.\n\nIn the third experiment, the researcher co-applies the standard concentration of GABA along with a different molecule, picrotoxin.

This is characteristic of non-competitive antagonism, specifically open-channel blockade at the chloride pore. In such a case, the response can be modeled as\n$$\nE = E_{\\max}\\,\\theta\\,f_{u},\n$$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the agonist occupancy term as above and $f_{u}$ is the fraction of unblocked channels by picrotoxin, for example\n$$\nf_{u} = \\frac{1}{1 + [B]/K_{B}},\n$$\nwith $[B]$ the picrotoxin concentration and $K_{B}$ its binding constant at the pore site.
