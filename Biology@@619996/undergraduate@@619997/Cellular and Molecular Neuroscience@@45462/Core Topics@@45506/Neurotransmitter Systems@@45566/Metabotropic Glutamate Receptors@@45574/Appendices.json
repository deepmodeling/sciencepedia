{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Metabotropic glutamate receptors, like many G-protein coupled receptors, are marvels of modular protein engineering. How do we know which part of the receptor is responsible for recognizing its ligand, and which part determines the specific intracellular signal it will generate? This practice delves into this fundamental question of structure and function by exploring a hypothetical chimeric receptor [@problem_id:2342484]. By conceptually combining domains from different mGluR subtypes, you can predict the signaling outcome and gain a deeper appreciation for the elegant design principles that allow for such diverse signaling from a single family of receptors.", "problem": "In a molecular neuroscience experiment, a genetic construct is designed to express a chimeric metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) in a stable cell line that endogenously expresses all necessary downstream signaling components. This chimeric receptor is engineered by fusing the extracellular Ligand-Binding Domain (LBD) of mGluR2 with the Transmembrane Domains (TMD) and the intracellular C-terminal Domain (CTD) of mGluR1. The cell line is then treated with a selective agonist known to specifically activate Group II mGluRs (the group to which mGluR2 belongs).\n\nFor context, mGluRs are G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) with distinct signaling pathways based on their subtype. Group II mGluRs (mGluR2, mGluR3) normally couple to $G_{i/o}$ proteins, leading to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Group I mGluRs (mGluR1, mGluR5) normally couple to $G_q$ proteins, leading to activation of Phospholipase C (PLC).\n\nWhich of the following describes the most immediate and primary intracellular signaling event that will occur in the cells expressing this chimeric receptor upon application of the selective Group II mGluR agonist?\n\nA. Activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to an increase in cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nB. Inhibition of adenylylyl cyclase, leading to a decrease in cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nC. Activation of Phospholipase C (PLC), leading to the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG).\n\nD. Direct gating of an associated cation-selective ion channel, leading to membrane depolarization.\n\nE. No significant change in intracellular second messenger levels, as the agonist-receptor domain pairing is non-functional.", "solution": "We apply the general principles of G-protein coupled receptor function. For class C GPCRs such as mGluRs, ligand specificity is primarily determined by the extracellular ligand-binding domain (LBD), while G protein coupling specificity is determined by the transmembrane domains (TMDs), intracellular loops, and C-terminal domain (CTD).\n\nStep 1: Ligand recognition. The chimeric receptor contains the LBD of mGluR2. Therefore, a selective Group II mGluR agonist will bind and activate the receptor, because the agonist recognition is dictated by the mGluR2-derived LBD.\n\nStep 2: G protein coupling specificity. The intracellular signaling pathway engaged upon activation is determined by the TMDs and CTD, which in this chimera are derived from mGluR1 (a Group I mGluR). Group I mGluRs characteristically couple to $G_{q}$ proteins, not to $G_{i/o}$.\n\nStep 3: Immediate signaling cascade. Activation of $G_{q}$ leads to activation of Phospholipase C (PLC). PLC hydrolyzes membrane $PIP_{2}$ into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($IP_{3}$) and diacylglycerol (DAG), i.e.,\n$$G_{q} \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\text{PLC activation} \\;\\Rightarrow\\; PIP_{2} \\to IP_{3} + \\text{DAG}.$$\nThus, the most immediate and primary intracellular event is PLC activation with production of $IP_{3}$ and DAG.\n\nStep 4: Exclusion of alternatives. Options A and B involve modulation of adenylyl cyclase via $G_{s}$ or $G_{i/o}$; however, the intracellular domains are from mGluR1, which preferentially couples to $G_{q}$, not $G_{i/o}$. Option D describes ionotropic channel gating, which is not a mechanism of GPCRs. Option E is not expected because the LBD-agonist pairing is functional, and downstream signaling machinery is present in the cell line.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is activation of PLC with generation of $IP_{3}$ and DAG.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2342484"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand that a specific receptor structure links to a particular intracellular pathway, we can use this knowledge as a powerful experimental tool. In this exercise, you'll step into the shoes of a neuropharmacologist tasked with characterizing a novel drug [@problem_id:2342499]. Using a series of logical experiments involving specific blockers for the Group I mGluR signaling cascade, you will learn to interpret data from a calcium imaging assay to pinpoint a drug's precise mechanism of action, a core skill in modern neuroscience and drug development.", "problem": "A neuropharmacologist is investigating a novel synthetic molecule, \"Compound Y,\" for its potential effects on neuronal signaling. The experiment uses cultured neurons that express Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The signaling pathway for these receptors is well-established: agonist binding activates a Gq-protein, which in turn activates Phospholipase C (PLC). PLC cleaves a membrane lipid to produce inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which then binds to IP3 receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to trigger the release of stored calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) into the cytoplasm.\n\nTo track intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration, the neurons are loaded with a fluorescent indicator dye whose fluorescence intensity increases as cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ levels rise. The following observations are made under different experimental conditions:\n\n1.  **Application of Compound Y:** When Compound Y is added to the culture medium, a large, transient increase in fluorescence is observed.\n2.  **Antagonist Pre-treatment:** When the neurons are pre-incubated with MCPG, a known competitive antagonist for Group I mGluRs, the subsequent addition of Compound Y causes no change in fluorescence.\n3.  **PLC Inhibitor Pre-treatment:** When the neurons are pre-incubated with U73122, a known inhibitor of PLC, the subsequent addition of Compound Y also causes no change in fluorescence.\n\nBased on this set of experimental results, what is the most plausible conclusion about the action of Compound Y?\n\nA. Compound Y is an antagonist for Group I mGluRs.\n\nB. Compound Y is an agonist for Group I mGluRs.\n\nC. Compound Y directly activates IP3 receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nD. Compound Y inhibits the re-uptake of calcium into the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nE. Compound Y is an agonist for an ionotropic receptor that is permeable to calcium.", "solution": "The established signaling for Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors is the $G_{q}$-PLC pathway: receptor activation leads to $G_{q}$ activation, which activates PLC, leading to hydrolysis of $PIP_{2}$ into $DAG$ and $IP_{3}$. $IP_{3}$ then binds $IP_{3}$ receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, releasing stored $Ca^{2+}$ into the cytosol. This can be summarized as:\n$$\\text{Group I mGluR} \\xrightarrow{G_{q}} \\text{PLC} \\xrightarrow{} IP_{3} \\xrightarrow{} \\text{ER } IP_{3}\\text{R} \\xrightarrow{} \\text{Ca}^{2+}\\text{ release}.$$\nThe fluorescence indicator reports cytosolic calcium with\n$$\\text{Fluorescence} \\propto [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}.$$\n\nObservation 1: Compound Y elicits a large, transient fluorescence increase. A transient increase in $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$ is characteristic of $IP_{3}$-mediated release from the endoplasmic reticulum, though other sources (e.g., ionotropic calcium influx) could also increase fluorescence; the pharmacology will discriminate the pathway.\n\nObservation 2: Pre-incubation with MCPG, a competitive antagonist at Group I mGluRs, abolishes the response to Compound Y. Because MCPG competitively blocks Group I mGluRs, the absence of a response in its presence implies that Compound Yâ€™s effect requires activation of Group I mGluRs. If Compound Y acted downstream of the receptor (e.g., directly on $IP_{3}$ receptors or on ER calcium pumps), then blockade at the receptor level would not prevent the calcium increase.\n\nObservation 3: Pre-incubation with U73122, a PLC inhibitor, also abolishes the response to Compound Y. This indicates that PLC activity is required for the effect of Compound Y. Therefore, Compound Y does not act at steps downstream of PLC (e.g., directly opening $IP_{3}$ receptors) and instead requires the intact $G_{q}$-PLC-$IP_{3}$ cascade.\n\nEliminations:\n- Option A (antagonist) is inconsistent with Observation 1; an antagonist would not produce a large transient increase in $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$.\n- Option C (direct activation of $IP_{3}$ receptors) is inconsistent with both Observations 2 and 3; neither mGluR antagonism nor PLC inhibition should prevent a direct $IP_{3}$ receptor agonist from releasing $Ca^{2+}$.\n- Option D (inhibition of ER re-uptake) would not be prevented by mGluR antagonism or PLC inhibition and typically would produce a more sustained elevation rather than a receptor- and PLC-dependent transient.\n- Option E (agonist at a calcium-permeable ionotropic receptor) would not be blocked by an mGluR antagonist or by PLC inhibition, as ionotropic calcium influx does not require the $G_{q}$-PLC-$IP_{3}$ pathway.\n\nThe convergence of receptor antagonism sensitivity and PLC dependence supports that Compound Y acts upstream in this pathway as an agonist at Group I mGluRs, engaging the canonical $G_{q}$-PLC-$IP_{3}$ cascade to release ER $Ca^{2+}$ and transiently elevate $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2342499"}, {"introduction": "The biochemical cascades initiated by mGluRs ultimately serve to modulate neuronal communication. This practice shifts our focus from the intracellular world to the synapse itself, exploring how presynaptic mGluRs act as critical regulators of neurotransmitter release [@problem_id:2342483].

Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, they record postsynaptic currents from a pyramidal neuron. To isolate miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), which result from the spontaneous release of single vesicles of glutamate, the bath solution contains tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block action potentials and picrotoxin to block GABA$_\\text{A}$ receptor-mediated inhibitory currents.\n\nAfter establishing a stable baseline recording of mEPSCs, the researcher bath-applies L-2-Amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4), a selective agonist for Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Group III mGluRs are known to be coupled to Gi/Go-family G-proteins and are predominantly expressed on presynaptic terminals.\n\nBased on the canonical signaling pathway of these receptors, what are the predicted effects of L-AP4 application on the frequency and amplitude of the mEPSCs recorded from the pyramidal neuron?\n\nA. mEPSC frequency will increase, and mEPSC amplitude will increase.\n\nB. mEPSC frequency will decrease, and mEPSC amplitude will decrease.\n\nC. mEPSC frequency will decrease, and mEPSC amplitude will show no change.\n\nD. mEPSC frequency will show no change, and mEPSC amplitude will decrease.\n\nE. mEPSC frequency will increase, and mEPSC amplitude will show no change.", "solution": "The experimental configuration isolates miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs): tetrodotoxin blocks action potentials, so events are spontaneous, and picrotoxin blocks GABA$_\\text{A}$ receptors, so recorded events are glutamatergic. Thus, the recorded mEPSCs reflect quantal release of glutamate from presynaptic terminals onto postsynaptic AMPA-type receptors.\n\nL-AP4 is a selective agonist of Group III mGluRs, which are predominantly presynaptic and coupled to $G_{i/o}$ G-proteins.

Denote the release probability by $P_{r}$ and the number of functional release sites by $N$. The rate (frequency) of spontaneous vesicle fusion events scales as\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{mEPSC}} \\propto N P_{r}.\n$$\nBecause L-AP4 via $G_{i/o}$ signaling reduces presynaptic calcium influx and cAMP/PKA signaling, it decreases $P_{r}$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{mEPSC}}<0.\n$$\n\nThe mEPSC amplitude reflects the quantal size and postsynaptic receptor responsiveness, not the presynaptic release probability. A standard representation of the peak mEPSC amplitude is\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{mEPSC}} \\propto q \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{post}},\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the quantal size (vesicular glutamate content and cleft glutamate transient) and $R_{\\mathrm{post}}$ summarizes postsynaptic AMPA receptor number/conductance and the driving force.
