This function arises from its dual-gating mechanism, which requires two distinct signals to occur simultaneously for the channel to open. This foundational exercise [@problem_id:2341633] asks you to describe the state of the receptor under typical resting conditions and identify the critical event needed to allow ion flow, reinforcing the core principles of its voltage-dependent magnesium block.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating synaptic transmission at a glutamatergic synapse. The postsynaptic neuron has a stable resting membrane potential of -75 mV. A presynaptic action potential causes a release of glutamate, which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. At this resting potential, a divalent cation, magnesium ($\\text{Mg}^{2+}$), is known to interact with the NMDA receptor channel.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the NMDA receptor immediately after glutamate binding, while the postsynaptic neuron remains at -75 mV, and the condition required for significant ion influx through it?\n\nA. The channel is open and allows significant ion flow because the binding of glutamate is the only requirement for channel activation.\n\nB. The channel is blocked by a magnesium ion. This block is removed when the postsynaptic membrane is hyperpolarized to a more negative potential.\n\nC. The channel is blocked by a magnesium ion. This block is relieved when the postsynaptic membrane is significantly depolarized to a less negative potential.\n\nD. The channel remains closed and impermeable because the postsynaptic membrane potential is too negative for glutamate to bind effectively.", "solution": "We analyze the NMDA receptor behavior using known biophysical principles of ligand-gated, voltage-dependent ion channels.\n\n1) Ligand binding: Glutamate binding to NMDA receptors is necessary for channel activation, and it can occur at the resting membrane potential. Therefore, the statement that the membrane is too negative for glutamate to bind is incorrect. Binding does not require depolarization.\n\n2) Voltage-dependent $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ block: NMDA receptors exhibit a voltage-dependent block by extracellular magnesium. At a negative postsynaptic potential such as $-75 \\text{ mV}$, an $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ion sits in the pore and prevents significant ion flux despite ligand binding. This is an open-channel block phenomenon that depends on membrane voltage.\n\n3) Electrostatic rationale: The $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ion carries charge $q=+2e$. The inside-negative membrane potential creates an electric field that exerts a force $F=qE$ directing positively charged $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ into the pore, stabilizing the block at hyperpolarized potentials. When the membrane depolarizes (becomes less negative), the electric field driving $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ into the pore is reduced and the positively charged ion is relieved from the blocking site, allowing current to pass through the channel.\n\n4) Condition for significant ion influx: Significant ion influx through NMDA receptors requires both ligand binding and relief of the $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ block, which occurs upon sufficient depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane to a less negative potential.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A is false because glutamate binding alone is not sufficient for significant ion flow due to the voltage-dependent $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ block.\n- B is false because hyperpolarization enhances, not relieves, the $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ block.\n- C is true because the $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ block is relieved by significant depolarization to a less negative potential.\n- D is false because glutamate can bind at resting potential; the lack of current is due to $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ block, not failure of binding.\n\nTherefore, the accurate description is that the channel is blocked by $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ at $-75 \\text{ mV}$ and that depolarization relieves the block, enabling significant ion influx.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341633"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a concept in theory is one thing; recognizing its signature in experimental data is another.

Which of the following statements most accurately contrasts the shape of the I-V curve obtained in Condition 1 with that obtained in Condition 2?\n\nA. The I-V curve is ohmic (linear) in Condition 1 but becomes non-linear with an outward rectification in Condition 2, meaning current flows more easily out of the cell than into it.\n\nB. The reversal potential is approximately 0 mV in Condition 1 but is shifted to a strongly negative potential (e.g., -50 mV) in Condition 2 due to the blocking action of $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$.\n\nC. In Condition 1, the I-V curve is nearly linear. In Condition 2, the I-V curve is \"N-shaped\", showing very little inward current at negative potentials near resting potential, which then increases sharply upon depolarization past a certain threshold.\n\nD. The presence of $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ in Condition 2 acts as a non-competitive inhibitor that reduces the amplitude of the current equally at all voltages, resulting in an I-V curve with the same shape as in Condition 1 but with a smaller slope.\n\nE.

For NMDA receptors, which are nonselective cation channels permeable to $\\text{Na}^{+}$, $\\text{K}^{+}$, and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, $E_{\\text{rev}}$ is approximately $0$ due to mixed cation permeability (given by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz framework), and it does not depend on extracellular $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ if $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ is non-permeant.\n\nCondition 1 (no $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$): With $\\left[\\text{Mg}^{2+}\\right]=0$, there is no voltage-dependent block.

For negative $V$ (inside negative), $\\exp\\!\\left(-z\\delta F V/(R T)\\right)$ increases, so $\\beta(V)$ is large and $g_{\\text{eff}}(V)$ is small, leading to very little inward current.

While current indeed is greatly reduced at negative potentials and larger at positive potentials, this statement does not capture the hallmark steep, threshold-like relief from block and the \"N-shaped\" curve; it is less precise than the standard description.\n- B: Incorrect; the reversal potential remains approximately $0$ because $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ is a blocker, not a permeant ion contributing to $E_{\\text{rev}}$.\n- C: Correct; Condition 1 is nearly linear, and Condition 2 is \"N-shaped\" with little inward current at negative potentials and a sharp increase upon depolarization as $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ block is relieved.\n- D: Incorrect; $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ block is strongly voltage dependent, not a voltage-independent non-competitive reduction in amplitude.\n- E: Incorrect; it reverses the actual situation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate contrast is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341698"}, {"introduction": "The biophysical properties of ion channels are not just academic details; they have profound consequences for brain function.
