The postsynaptic neuron has a resting membrane potential of -70 mV and an action potential threshold of -55 mV. Under normal conditions, a single stimulus to the presynaptic neuron reliably causes an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) that depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane to -60 mV.\n\nThe researcher then introduces a novel experimental drug, \"Vesiculosin,\" to the culture medium. Subsequent analysis reveals that Vesiculosin is a highly specific and potent antagonist of the Vesicular Glutamate Transporters (VGluTs) located on the membrane of synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. After allowing sufficient time for the drug to take effect, the researcher applies the same single stimulus to the presynaptic neuron.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most likely immediate postsynaptic membrane potential measurement following the presynaptic stimulus in the presence of Vesiculosin?\n\nA.

Under normal conditions, a presynaptic action potential triggers vesicle fusion, releasing glutamate into the synaptic cleft. Postsynaptic AMPA receptors increase their open probability, producing a synaptic conductance $g_{\\text{syn}}$ with reversal potential $E_{\\text{rev}}$ near the cation reversal (approximately around zero for mixed Na and K). The synaptic current is\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}}=g_{\\text{syn}}\\left(V_{m}-E_{\\text{rev}}\\right),\n$$\nand the membrane response obeys Ohm’s law\n$$\n\\Delta V = R_{m} I_{\\text{syn}},\n$$\nso an excitatory input at a resting membrane potential that is negative relative to $E_{\\text{rev}}$ produces a depolarizing $\\Delta V>0$. This explains the observed normal EPSP that shifts the membrane from the resting value ($-70$ mV) to approximately $-60$ mV.\n\nVesiculosin is a highly specific and potent antagonist of vesicular glutamate transporters. The relevant physical principle is that glutamate is loaded into synaptic vesicles by VGluTs using the proton electrochemical gradient; blockade of VGluTs prevents vesicular glutamate accumulation. After sufficient time for the drug to take effect, previously filled vesicles are depleted by ongoing turnover, leaving newly cycling vesicles effectively empty of glutamate.

A smaller EPSP (E) would require partial vesicular filling; however, given the drug is highly potent and sufficient time has been allowed for vesicle turnover, the most likely immediate effect is no measurable EPSP.

This practice shifts our focus to the initial postsynaptic response, mediated by fast-acting AMPA receptors. You will analyze how a competitive antagonist—a molecule that vies for the same binding site as glutamate—affects the resulting excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), providing a foundational understanding of neuropharmacology and synaptic modulation [@problem_id:2337535].", "problem": "In the central nervous system, glutamate serves as the primary excitatory neurotransmitter. During synaptic transmission at a typical excitatory synapse, the release of glutamate from the presynaptic terminal leads to its binding to postsynaptic receptors. One crucial class of these receptors is the Alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic Acid (AMPA) receptor, which is an ionotropic receptor. Upon binding glutamate, the AMPA receptor channel opens, allowing an influx of positively charged sodium ions (Na⁺) into the postsynaptic neuron. This influx causes a localized, transient depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, known as an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP).\n\nA neuroscientist is studying a single glutamatergic synapse in a laboratory setting. They apply a novel drug that acts as a competitive antagonist specifically for AMPA receptors. This means the drug binds to the same site on the AMPA receptor as glutamate but does not cause the ion channel to open, effectively blocking glutamate from binding. After the application of this antagonist, a single action potential is triggered in the presynaptic neuron, causing a standard amount of glutamate to be released.\n\nHow would the application of this competitive antagonist affect the magnitude of the resulting EPSP in the postsynaptic neuron, compared to the EPSP generated without the drug?\n\nA. The EPSP magnitude will increase.\n\nB. The EPSP magnitude will decrease.\n\nC. The EPSP will be converted into an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP).\n\nD. The EPSP magnitude will be unchanged, but the duration of the EPSP will be significantly shorter.\n\nE. The EPSP will be completely unaffected because the amount of glutamate released from the presynaptic terminal does not change.", "solution": "The AMPA receptor is an ionotropic ligand-gated channel whose opening probability depends on agonist (glutamate) binding. The postsynaptic current mediated by AMPA receptors can be written as\n$$\nI_{\\text{AMPA}} = g_{\\text{AMPA}}(V - E_{\\text{rev}}),\n$$\nwhere $g_{\\text{AMPA}}$ is the total AMPA conductance, $V$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{\\text{rev}}$ is the AMPA reversal potential. The conductance can be expressed as\n$$\ng_{\\text{AMPA}} = N_{\\text{open}} \\gamma,\n$$\nwith $\\gamma$ the single-channel conductance and $N_{\\text{open}}$ the number of open receptors, which is proportional to the fraction of receptors occupied by glutamate.\n\nWith a competitive antagonist $I$ at the same binding site, the fractional occupancy of receptors by agonist $A$ (glutamate) at fixed $[A]$ is reduced according to the standard competitive binding relation\n$$\n\\theta_{A} = \\frac{\\frac{[A]}{K_{A}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}},\n$$\nwhere $K_{A}$ and $K_{I}$ are the equilibrium dissociation constants for agonist and antagonist, respectively.

The time course of the EPSP is primarily governed by glutamate transient and receptor/channel kinetics; a competitive antagonist at fixed glutamate reduces the number of openings rather than accelerating channel closing, so there is no reason to expect the duration to be significantly shorter independent of amplitude scaling. Although the amount of glutamate released is unchanged, the postsynaptic effect depends on receptor occupancy and conductance, which are reduced by competition at the binding site.

After its release into the synaptic cleft, it is rapidly cleared, primarily by astrocytes, to terminate the signal and prevent excitotoxicity. This clearance is an energy-intensive process.\n\nConsider the events following the release of a single synaptic vesicle, which contains exactly 5,000 molecules of glutamate. The glutamate is taken up by an astrocyte via a high-affinity transporter known as the Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter (EAAT). For each molecule of glutamate transported into the astrocyte, the EAAT also co-transports three sodium ions ($Na^{+}$) and one proton ($H^{+}$) into the cell, while simultaneously counter-transporting one potassium ion ($K^{+}$) out of the cell.\n\nTo maintain cellular homeostasis, the astrocyte must then use ATP-powered pumps to restore the original ion gradients. The Sodium-Potassium pump ($Na^{+}/K^{+}$-ATPase) hydrolyzes one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to export three $Na^{+}$ ions and import two $K^{+}$ ions. A separate plasma membrane proton pump hydrolyzes one ATP molecule to export two $H^{+}$ ions.\n\nAssuming that the only perturbations to these ion gradients are caused by the EAAT-mediated uptake of the 5,000 glutamate molecules, calculate the total number of ATP molecules that must be consumed by the astrocyte to completely restore the sodium, potassium, and proton gradients to their initial state.
