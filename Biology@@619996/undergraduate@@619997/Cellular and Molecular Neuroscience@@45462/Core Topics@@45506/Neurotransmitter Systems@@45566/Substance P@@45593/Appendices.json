For simplicity, we will neglect the contribution of other ions. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations of these ions are maintained as follows:\n- Intracellular Potassium $[K^{+}]_{in} = 140$ mM\n- Extracellular Potassium $[K^{+}]_{out} = 5$ mM\n- Intracellular Sodium $[Na^{+}]_{in} = 15$ mM\n- Extracellular Sodium $[Na^{+}]_{out} = 145$ mM\n\nIn its initial resting state, the permeability of the membrane to sodium ions, $P_{Na}$, is 4.0% of its permeability to potassium ions, $P_K$.\n\nThis neuron is then exposed to Substance P, a neuropeptide that binds to its cognate $G_{q/11}$ protein-coupled receptor. The activation of this receptor triggers an intracellular signaling cascade that leads to the phosphorylation and functional closure of a specific subpopulation of potassium leak channels, known as two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels. This modulatory event reduces the total resting potassium permeability of the membrane by 60%. The permeability to sodium ions is unaffected.\n\nAssume the neuron is at a physiological temperature of 37°C, for which the term $RT/F$ is equal to 26.7 mV, where $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\nCalculate the new resting membrane potential of the neuron after the application of Substance P.

This exercise [@problem_id:2351555] presents a quantitative model where glutamate alone is insufficient to induce LTP. It challenges you to demonstrate computationally how the co-release of Substance P provides the necessary additional depolarization to unblock NMDA receptors and enable a lasting increase in synaptic strength.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the role of Substance P (SP) in synaptic plasticity at the synapse between primary sensory C-fibers and dorsal horn neurons, a key circuit in pain processing. The prevailing hypothesis is that the co-release of the neuropeptide SP with the primary neurotransmitter glutamate is necessary for inducing Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a cellular correlate of learning and memory, at these synapses.\n\nTo test this, the neuroscientist uses a simplified quantitative model based on whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from a dorsal horn neuron. The model is defined by the following parameters:\n\n**Postsynaptic Neuron Properties:**\n- Resting membrane potential, $V_{rest} = -70$ mV.\n- Input resistance, $R_{in} = 250\\ \\text{M}\\Omega$.\n- The baseline Excitatory Postsynaptic Current (EPSC), evoked by a single C-fiber stimulus, is mediated purely by AMPA-type glutamate receptors. Its amplitude is $I_{AMPA, initial} = 100\\ \\text{pA}$. For all calculations, treat current amplitudes as positive values.\n\n**LTP Induction and Expression:**\n- LTP induction requires sufficient membrane depolarization to relieve the voltage-dependent magnesium ($Mg^{2+}$) block of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The critical membrane potential threshold for LTP induction is $V_{thresh} = -40\\ \\text{mV}$.\n- A high-frequency stimulation (HFS) protocol is used to induce LTP. The temporal summation of individual postsynaptic potentials during HFS results in a peak depolarization that is a factor $\\alpha = 1.1$ times the depolarization caused by a single stimulus.\n- If the neuron's membrane potential reaches or exceeds $V_{thresh}$ during the HFS protocol, LTP is successfully induced. This leads to a persistent increase in the AMPA receptor-mediated current, with its new amplitude being $P = 1.63$ times its initial amplitude. If the threshold is not reached, the synaptic strength remains unchanged.\n\n**Action of Substance P:**\n- During HFS, SP is co-released with glutamate. SP binds to Neurokinin-1 Receptors (NK1R) on the postsynaptic neuron, generating a slow, sustained depolarization of $\\Delta V_{SP} = 15\\ \\text{mV}$. This depolarization linearly adds to the depolarization produced by the glutamate-mediated HFS.\n\n**The Experiment:**\nTwo conditions are compared. In the **control condition**, HFS is delivered, allowing the normal co-release of glutamate and SP. In the **test condition**, the same HFS is delivered in the presence of a specific NK1R antagonist, which completely blocks the action of SP without affecting any other neuronal or synaptic parameters.\n\nCalculate the magnitude of the difference between the final, post-HFS AMPA-mediated EPSC amplitude in the control condition and the final, post-HFS AMPA-mediated EPSC amplitude in the test condition.

Their central hypothesis is that chronic inflammatory pain causes an upregulation of Substance P, a key neuropeptide in pain signaling, within the superficial layers of the spinal cord's dorsal horn. To test this, they plan to use an antibody-based visualization technique on spinal cord tissue from two groups of mice: a control group and a group where chronic inflammatory pain was induced in a hind paw.\n\nThey have drafted four potential experimental protocols. As the senior lab member, you must determine which protocol is the most scientifically rigorous and appropriate for testing their hypothesis.\n\nA. Spinal cord tissue from both groups will be sectioned. The sections will be incubated with a primary antibody made in a rabbit that targets Substance P. After washing, the sections will be incubated with a secondary antibody, specifically a goat anti-mouse antibody, which is conjugated to a fluorescent tag. The resulting fluorescence will be quantified in the ventral horn of the spinal cord for comparison between the two groups.\n\nB. Spinal cord tissue from both groups will be sectioned. The sections will be incubated with a primary antibody targeting Substance P. A separate set of control sections will be prepared by incubating them in a solution containing only the fluorescently-conjugated secondary antibody, omitting the primary antibody. All sections will then be processed with the secondary antibody. Fluorescence intensity will be compared between the control and pain model groups in the superficial dorsal horn.

The sections will be incubated with a primary antibody targeting Substance P. Following this, the sections will be incubated with an appropriate fluorescently-tagged secondary antibody. Imaging and quantification of fluorescence will be performed on the superficial dorsal horn. To ensure the specificity of the primary antibody, the manufacturer's validation data, which shows a single band on a Western blot for Substance P, will be cited in the methods section as sufficient proof of specificity.\n\nD. Spinal cord tissue from both groups will be properly fixed and sectioned, with sections from both control and pain model mice mounted on the same glass slides to ensure identical processing conditions. One set of sections (experimental) will be incubated with a primary antibody that specifically binds to Substance P. A parallel set of sections (negative control) on the same slides will be incubated in a solution that lacks the primary antibody.

Additionally, quantification is proposed in the ventral horn, which does not test the stated hypothesis focused on the superficial dorsal horn. Therefore, A is scientifically inappropriate.\n- Protocol B: Includes a proper no-primary negative control to detect nonspecific secondary binding. Quantification is in the correct region (superficial dorsal horn). However, it allows processing tissues from the two groups on different days, introducing batch effects that can confound group comparisons. Therefore, B is not optimally rigorous.\n- Protocol C: Performs staining and quantification in the correct region but relies on manufacturer’s Western blot data for specificity without in-experiment negative controls (e.g., no-primary control). Western blot validation does not guarantee IHC specificity in tissue context. Therefore, C lacks essential controls.\n- Protocol D: Controls and pain model sections are mounted on the same slides, ensuring identical processing conditions and minimizing batch effects. It includes a parallel negative control set lacking the primary antibody on the same slides to detect nonspecific secondary binding and autofluorescence. Quantification is performed in the correct anatomical region (superficial dorsal horn). The protocol specifies using a suitable secondary antibody that recognizes the primary antibody, addressing species matching. This design is the most rigorous and appropriate for testing the stated hypothesis.\n\nConclusion: Protocol D best satisfies antibody species compatibility, appropriate anatomical targeting, rigorous negative controls, and elimination of batch effects by concurrent processing on the same slides.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2351557"}]}
