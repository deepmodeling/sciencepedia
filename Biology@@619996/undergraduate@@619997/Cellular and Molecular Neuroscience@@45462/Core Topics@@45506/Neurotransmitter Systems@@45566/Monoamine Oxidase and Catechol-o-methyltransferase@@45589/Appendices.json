Consider the monoamine neurotransmitters, which include catecholamines like dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as indolamines like serotonin. The synaptic concentration of these neurotransmitters is tightly regulated by metabolic enzymes.\n\nA research team is designing a new drug to treat a condition specifically linked to insufficient dopaminergic activity. Their therapeutic strategy is to inhibit one of the key metabolic enzymes. The ideal drug must satisfy two critical criteria:\n1. It must effectively increase the synaptic availability of dopamine.\n2. It must have minimal to no effect on the synaptic levels of serotonin and norepinephrine to avoid common side effects such as mood disturbances and cardiovascular changes.\n\nYou are provided with the following simplified substrate profiles for the three major enzymes involved in monoamine degradation:\n\n*   **Monoamine Oxidase A (MAO-A):** Efficiently metabolizes serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.\n*   **Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B):** Shows high selectivity for metabolizing dopamine, with negligible activity towards serotonin and norepinephrine at therapeutic concentrations.\n*   **Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT):** Metabolizes all catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) but has no activity towards serotonin.\n\nBased on this information, which enzyme would be the most precise and ideal target for inhibition to achieve the desired therapeutic outcome?\n\nA.

Pharmacodynamic principle: inhibiting a metabolic enzyme that degrades a neurotransmitter increases the synaptic availability of that neurotransmitter; specifically, if an enzyme has substrate set $S$, then inhibiting it increases synaptic levels of all members of $S$.\n\nFrom the provided substrate profiles:\n- MAO-A metabolizes serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Therefore, inhibiting MAO-A would increase all three neurotransmitters, violating the requirement to spare serotonin and norepinephrine.\n- MAO-B shows high selectivity for dopamine with negligible activity toward serotonin and norepinephrine at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, inhibiting MAO-B would increase dopamine preferentially while minimally affecting serotonin and norepinephrine, satisfying both criteria.\n- COMT metabolizes all catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and not serotonin. Therefore, inhibiting COMT would increase dopamine but would also increase norepinephrine (and epinephrine), violating the requirement to spare norepinephrine.\n- A combination of MAO-A and COMT would increase serotonin and norepinephrine substantially (via MAO-A) and norepinephrine further (via COMT), thus clearly violating the selectivity requirement.\n- A combination of MAO-B and COMT would increase dopamine but also increase norepinephrine (via COMT), again violating the selectivity requirement.\n\nTherefore, the unique option that increases dopamine while sparing serotonin and norepinephrine is inhibition of MAO-B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2344863"}, {"introduction": "Inhibiting an enzyme is not a simple on-or-off switch; the mechanism of inhibition matters immensely.
