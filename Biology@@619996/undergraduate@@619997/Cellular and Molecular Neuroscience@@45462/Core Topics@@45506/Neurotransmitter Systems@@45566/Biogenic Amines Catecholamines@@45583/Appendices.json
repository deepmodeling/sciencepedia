The synthesis of neurotransmitters is a masterpiece of spatial organization, with different steps happening in the cytoplasm versus inside synaptic vesicles. This exercise [@problem_id:2328804] presents a hypothetical scenario involving a mislocalized enzyme to test your understanding of how this subcellular compartmentalization is essential for producing the correct chemical messenger.", "problem": "In a typical noradrenergic neuron, the synthesis of catecholamines follows a specific sequence of enzymatic reactions occurring in different cellular compartments. The precursor amino acid, tyrosine, is converted to L-DOPA and then to dopamine in the cytosol. This dopamine is then actively transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by the Vesicular Monoamine Transporter (VMAT). Inside the vesicles, the enzyme Dopamine $\\beta$-Hydroxylase (DBH) converts dopamine into norepinephrine, which is then released as the primary neurotransmitter upon neuronal excitation.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario involving a genetically engineered noradrenergic neuron that expresses a mutant form of DBH. This mutation does not affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme but alters its sorting signal, causing it to be localized exclusively to the cytosol instead of being transported into synaptic vesicles. All other cellular machinery, including the other synthesis enzymes and VMAT, function normally.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the primary consequence for the chemical signal released by this mutant neuron upon stimulation?\n\nA. The neuron will release L-DOPA as its primary neurotransmitter.\n\nB. The neuron will be unable to synthesize any catecholamines, resulting in no neurotransmitter release.\n\nC. The neuron will release norepinephrine, but the synthesis process will be significantly less efficient, leading to much lower quantities being released.\n\nD. The neuron will release primarily dopamine instead of norepinephrine.\n\nE. The neuron will release epinephrine instead of norepinephrine.\n\nF. The neuron will release an equimolar mixture of dopamine and norepinephrine.", "solution": "Normal noradrenergic transmitter synthesis and packaging proceeds as follows: tyrosine is converted in the cytosol to L-DOPA by tyrosine hydroxylase, then L-DOPA is converted to dopamine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Dopamine is then transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by VMAT. Within the vesicle lumen, DBH converts dopamine to norepinephrine. Because conversion occurs inside the vesicle, the stored and subsequently released transmitter is norepinephrine.\n\nIn the mutant neuron, the catalytic activity of DBH is intact but the enzyme is mislocalized to the cytosol. The immediate consequences follow from two principles:\n- VMAT transports monoamines from cytosol to vesicles; both dopamine and norepinephrine are VMAT substrates, but conversion inside the vesicle will not occur because vesicles now lack DBH.\n- Compartmentalization normally protects newly synthesized transmitter from cytosolic degradative enzymes (e.g., monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase) and ensures conversion to norepinephrine prior to storage.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Cytosolic synthesis up to dopamine is unchanged; cytosolic dopamine is produced as usual.\n2. With DBH in the cytosol, some cytosolic dopamine will be converted there to norepinephrine before vesicular uptake.\n3. VMAT will take up whichever monoamines are present in the cytosol. However, any dopamine that is taken up into vesicles will remain dopamine because DBH is absent from vesicles; there is no intravesicular conversion to norepinephrine.\n4. Norepinephrine formed in the cytosol must compete with dopamine for VMAT-mediated uptake and is more exposed to cytosolic degradation prior to packaging, reducing the efficiency with which norepinephrine is stored.\n5. Therefore, vesicular contents will shift toward dopamine, and upon stimulation, the neuron will release primarily dopamine rather than norepinephrine.\n\nExcluding alternatives:\n- L-DOPA is not the stored or released transmitter because VMAT does not package L-DOPA and the pathway to dopamine remains intact, so A is incorrect.\n- Catecholamine synthesis is not abolished; both dopamine and norepinephrine can still be synthesized, so B is incorrect.\n- Although some norepinephrine may still be released, the dominant effect of losing intravesicular DBH is a switch in vesicular content to dopamine, not merely a quantitative reduction in norepinephrine, so C is not the best description.\n- Epinephrine requires phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, which is absent in noradrenergic neurons, so E is incorrect.\n- An equimolar mixture is not expected because relative amounts depend on kinetic competition between cytosolic conversion, cytosolic degradation, and VMAT uptake; with no vesicular conversion, dopamine predominates, so F is incorrect.\n\nThus, the primary consequence is release of dopamine instead of norepinephrine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2328804"}, {"introduction": "The life of a neurotransmitter doesn't end with its synthesis; it's a continuous cycle of storage, release, action, and termination. The amount of catecholamine in the synapse is finely tuned by a balance of these processes.

These neurons synthesize and release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE). The life cycle of NE in the presynaptic terminal involves several key steps: it is synthesized in the cytoplasm, subsequently transported into synaptic vesicles for storage, and then released into the synaptic cleft upon neuronal stimulation. Following release, its action is terminated when it is transported back into the presynaptic cytoplasm by the Norepinephrine Transporter (NET). Once back in the cytoplasm, NE can either be repackaged into vesicles or degraded by the enzyme Monoamine Oxidase (MAO), which is located on the outer membrane of mitochondria within the cell.\n\nThe researcher introduces a potent and specific inhibitor of Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) to the neuronal culture.
