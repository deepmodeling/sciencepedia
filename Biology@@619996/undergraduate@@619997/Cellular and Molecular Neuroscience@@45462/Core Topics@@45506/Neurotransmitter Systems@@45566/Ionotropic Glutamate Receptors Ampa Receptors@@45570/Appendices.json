Using the voltage-clamp technique, neuroscientists can measure the flow of ions through a channel at different membrane potentials, generating a Current-Voltage ($I$-$V$) relationship. This exercise challenges you to interpret a classic $I$-$V$ plot to identify an AMPA receptor based on its unique electrophysiological \"fingerprint\"—its linear conductance and specific reversal potential [@problem_id:2339995]. This is a core skill for interpreting electrophysiological data.", "problem": "A neurophysiologist is conducting a whole-cell voltage-clamp experiment on a cultured hippocampal neuron to characterize a synaptic current. The neuron is held at various command potentials, and the neurotransmitter glutamate is briefly applied to the cell. The resulting peak inward or outward current is measured at each potential. The experiment is performed in a solution that contains antagonists for all receptors except for a specific type of ionotropic glutamate receptor being studied. When the peak current is plotted against the holding potential, the resulting Current-Voltage (I-V) relationship is observed to be nearly perfectly linear over the range of -80 mV to +40 mV. Furthermore, the current is found to reverse its direction (i.e., the net current is zero) at a membrane potential of exactly 0 mV.\n\nBased on these specific electrophysiological properties, which of the following receptor types is most likely responsible for the observed current?\n\nA. Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor\n\nB. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor\n\nC. Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA$_A$) receptor\n\nD. Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)\n\nE. Voltage-gated potassium channel", "solution": "In a voltage-clamp experiment, the peak ligand-gated current at a holding potential $V$ can be written as\n$$\nI(V) = g(V)\\,\\big(V - E_{rev}\\big),\n$$\nwhere $E_{rev}$ is the reversal potential of the channel and $g(V)$ is the conductance that may or may not depend on voltage. A nearly perfectly linear I–V relationship over a wide range implies $g(V) \\approx \\text{constant}$ (ohmic behavior), so the channel has negligible intrinsic voltage dependence or voltage-dependent block in that range. The fact that the current reverses at exactly $V=0$ mV implies\n$$\nE_{rev} = 0 \\text{ mV}.\n$$\n\nFor a nonselective cation channel permeable to $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$, the reversal potential is given by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz expression for monovalent cations:\n$$\nE_{rev} = \\frac{RT}{F}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_{o} + P_{K}[K^{+}]_{o}}{P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_{i} + P_{K}[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right).\n$$\nWhen $P_{Na} \\approx P_{K}$ and the typical ionic gradients apply (with $[Na^{+}]_{o} \\gg [Na^{+}]_{i}$ and $[K^{+}]_{i} \\gg [K^{+}]_{o}$), the numerator and denominator are of similar magnitude, making the logarithm close to zero and thus\n$$\nE_{rev} \\approx 0 \\text{ mV}.\n$$\nMoreover, such channels exhibit approximately constant conductance over the tested range, yielding an ohmic, nearly linear I–V relation. These properties are characteristic of AMPA receptors.\n\nIn contrast:\n- NMDA receptors exhibit strong voltage-dependent $Mg^{2+}$ block, so $g(V)$ is voltage dependent and the I–V curve is markedly non-linear (inward rectification/J-shaped), despite an $E_{rev}$ near 0 mV.\n- GABA$_A$ receptors are chloride channels with $E_{rev} \\approx E_{Cl}$, typically negative relative to 0 mV, and they are not activated by glutamate.\n- Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G-protein-coupled and do not produce fast, linear ionotropic currents directly.\n- Voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels are not glutamate-gated and have $E_{rev} \\approx E_{K}$, which is typically negative, and show voltage-dependent gating leading to non-linear I–V relations.\n\nTherefore, the receptor that best matches a linear I–V with $E_{rev} = 0$ mV under glutamate application is the AMPA receptor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2339995"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its peak current, the time course of a synaptic response is critical for information processing. The shape of an Excitatory Postsynaptic Current (EPSC) is governed by the kinetic properties of the underlying receptors, such as how quickly they activate, desensitize, and deactivate. This problem explores how a Positive Allosteric Modulator (PAM) that specifically slows the closing of the AMPA receptor channel alters the EPSC, providing insight into the relationship between molecular mechanisms and synaptic signal duration [@problem_id:2340025]. This principle is fundamental to understanding how many therapeutic drugs modulate brain function.", "problem": "A team of neuropharmacologists is investigating a novel synthetic compound, \"Neurofluxin,\" for its potential effects on synaptic transmission. They conduct experiments on cultured hippocampal neurons, measuring the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) generated by the activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. In their standard protocol, a brief, saturating pulse of glutamate is applied to the neuron, sufficient to activate the majority of synaptic AMPA receptors nearly simultaneously.\n\nThe team finds that Neurofluxin is a Positive Allosteric Modulator (PAM) of AMPA receptors. Further analysis reveals its specific mechanism of action: Neurofluxin binds to the receptor and significantly decreases the rate of channel deactivation (i.e., it slows the rate at which the open channel closes after glutamate unbinds). The compound does not alter the single-channel conductance of the receptor, nor does it affect the peak open probability in response to a saturating glutamate concentration.\n\nBased on this mechanism, how would the co-application of Neurofluxin with glutamate alter the key properties of the measured AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC, compared to the control EPSC generated by glutamate alone? Consider the following properties: the peak amplitude of the current, the decay time constant ($\\tau_{decay}$), and the total charge transfer (the time integral of the current).\n\nA. The peak amplitude will increase, the decay time constant will decrease, and the total charge transfer will increase.\n\nB.

By the problem statement, Neurofluxin does not change $i$ and does not change $P_{\\text{open,peak}}$ at saturating glutamate, and $N$ is fixed. Therefore,\n$$\nI_{\\text{peak,drug}} = I_{\\text{peak,control}},\n$$\nso the peak amplitude remains unchanged.\n\nAfter the brief pulse, the decay of the EPSC is dominated by channel deactivation once glutamate unbinds.

They have transfected these neurons to express a modified version of the $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, where the GluA1 subunit is tagged with a Super Ecliptic pHluorin (SEP). SEP is a pH-sensitive variant of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) whose fluorescence is dependent on the local pH. At the acidic pH of intracellular vesicles (pH $\\approx 5.5$), its fluorescence intensity is only 8.0% of its maximal intensity, which is observed at the neutral pH of the synaptic cleft (pH $\\approx 7.4$).\n\nThe team conducts an experiment to quantify the trafficking of these receptors during synaptic potentiation. First, they measure the baseline fluorescence from a set of dendritic spines, obtaining an average value of $F_{base} = 120$ arbitrary units (a.u.). Next, they apply a chemical Long-Term Potentiation (cLTP) induction protocol, which is known to cause the insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. After the protocol, they measure the fluorescence from the same set of spines and find it has increased to $F_{LTP} = 165$ a.u. Finally, to determine the total number of SEP-tagged receptors available in the spines (both on the surface and in the internal vesicular pool), they apply a solution containing ammonium chloride ($NH_4Cl$). This treatment neutralizes all acidic intracellular compartments, causing all SEP tags to fluoresce maximally. This measurement yields a total fluorescence of $F_{total} = 400$ a.u.\n\nBased on these measurements, calculate the fractional increase in the number of AMPA receptors on the surface of the dendritic spines following cLTP, relative to the initial surface population.
