Kainate and Glutamate", "solution": "The experimental objective is to measure currents mediated exclusively by kainate receptors while applying glutamate, which activates AMPA, NMDA, and kainate receptors. To isolate kainate currents, the strategy is to pharmacologically block AMPA and NMDA receptors and avoid any drug that blocks kainate receptors.\n\nFirst, identify selective antagonists:\n- NMDA receptors are competitively antagonized by AP5 (also called APV); thus AP5 is appropriate to prevent NMDA receptor activation by glutamate.\n- AMPA receptors are commonly blocked in experimental settings by CNQX. While CNQX can antagonize both AMPA and kainate receptors, it is classically taught and widely used as an AMPA receptor antagonist in basic patch-clamp protocols to remove fast AMPA-mediated currents when combined with an NMDA blocker, leaving non-NMDA, non-AMPA components. Among the provided choices, it is the only candidate to target AMPA.\n- Kainate receptors are selectively antagonized by agents such as UBP310; therefore, UBP310 should not be used if the goal is to preserve kainate receptor function.\n- Picrotoxin and strychnine are antagonists at $\\text{GABA}_{\\text{A}}$ and glycine receptors, respectively; they do not block AMPA or NMDA and are irrelevant to isolating kainate currents.\n- NMDA and kainate (and glutamate) are agonists and therefore not useful for blocking.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A. AP5 and CNQX: AP5 blocks NMDA receptors; CNQX is used to block AMPA receptors in standard protocols. This combination is the intended choice to remove NMDA and AMPA while leaving kainate-mediated currents for measurement.\n- B. NMDA and CNQX: NMDA is an agonist and would activate NMDA receptors; this does not block NMDA receptors and is unsuitable. CNQX would also antagonize kainate, which is undesirable.\n- C. Picrotoxin and Strychnine: These target inhibitory receptors and do not block AMPA or NMDA; unsuitable.\n- D. UBP310 and AP5: UBP310 would block kainate receptors, directly opposing the goal; AP5 blocks NMDA; this would leave AMPA currents, not kainate.\n- E. Kainate and Glutamate: Both are agonists; they do not block receptors and would confound isolation.\n\nTherefore, the best available combination in the provided options to block NMDA and AMPA receptors while measuring kainate receptor-mediated currents is AP5 and CNQX.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2340177"}, {"introduction": "Once a specific receptor current is isolated, we can investigate its fundamental biophysical properties.
