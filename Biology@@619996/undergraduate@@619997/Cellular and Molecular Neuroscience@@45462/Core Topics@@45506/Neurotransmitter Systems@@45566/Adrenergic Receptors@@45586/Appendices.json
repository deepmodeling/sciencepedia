Pharmacologists achieve this by using a toolkit of selective drugs—agonists that activate specific receptors and antagonists that block them. This practice challenges you to think like a pharmacologist, interpreting experimental data on second messenger levels to deduce the adrenergic receptor profile of a neuronal cell line, a crucial skill for understanding and manipulating neural circuits. [@problem_id:2326666]", "problem": "A team of neuropharmacologists is studying a newly isolated neuronal cell line to characterize its response to adrenergic signaling. Their primary hypothesis is that these neurons express functional $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors. The key second messenger they are measuring is intracellular cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nIt is known that $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors are coupled to inhibitory G-proteins ($G_i$), which inhibit the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, leading to a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels. Conversely, $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors are coupled to stimulatory G-proteins ($G_s$), which activate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP levels.\n\nThe researchers conduct a series of experiments where they expose the cells to different pharmacological agents and measure the resulting steady-state intracellular cAMP concentration relative to the baseline (untreated cells). The baseline cAMP concentration is normalized to 100%.\n\nThe following agents are used:\n- **Clonidine:** A selective agonist for $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors.\n- **Yohimbine:** A selective antagonist for $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors.\n- **Isoproterenol:** A selective agonist for all $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors.\n\nThe results of their experiments are as follows:\n\n- **Condition 1:** Application of Clonidine alone resulted in a cAMP level of 45%.\n- **Condition 2:** Application of Yohimbine alone resulted in a cAMP level of 100%.\n- **Condition 3:** Co-application of Clonidine and Yohimbine resulted in a cAMP level of 98%.\n- **Condition 4:** Application of Isoproterenol alone resulted in a cAMP level of 320%.\n\nBased on this complete set of experimental data, which of the following conclusions is the most strongly supported?\n\nA. The neurons express functional $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors but not functional $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors.\n\nB. The neurons express functional $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors but not functional $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors.\n\nC. The neurons express both functional $\\alpha_2$- and functional $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors.\n\nD. The neurons do not express any functional adrenergic receptors, and the observed effects are due to experimental artifacts.\n\nE. Yohimbine functions as an inverse agonist in this cell line, and Clonidine has no effect.", "solution": "Define the baseline steady-state intracellular cAMP level as $1.00$ (normalized untreated control). By signaling principles, activation of $\\alpha_{2}$-adrenergic receptors couples via $G_{i}$ to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, yielding a steady-state $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ less than $1.00$, whereas activation of $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors couples via $G_{s}$ to stimulate adenylyl cyclase, yielding a steady-state $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ greater than $1.00$.\n\nClonidine is an $\\alpha_{2}$-agonist. Under Condition 1, clonidine alone produces $0.45$. Since $0.45<1.00$, and this direction of change (a decrease) matches the expected effect of $G_{i}$-coupled $\\alpha_{2}$ activation, this observation supports the presence of functional $\\alpha_{2}$-adrenergic receptors that can inhibit adenylyl cyclase.\n\nYohimbine is an $\\alpha_{2}$-antagonist. Under Condition 2, yohimbine alone produces $1.00$, equal to baseline. For a neutral antagonist in the absence of endogenous agonist or constitutive receptor activity, the expected effect is no change from baseline; thus $1.00$ supports that there is no detectable constitutive $\\alpha_{2}$ activity under these conditions and that yohimbine is not acting as an inverse agonist. Specifically, if yohimbine were an inverse agonist at $\\alpha_{2}$ receptors with constitutive $G_{i}$ activity, it would reduce $G_{i}$ signaling and thereby increase adenylyl cyclase activity, giving $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]>1.00$, which is not observed.\n\nUnder Condition 3, co-application of clonidine and yohimbine yields $0.98$. Since $0.98\\approx 1.00$, this is consistent with competitive antagonism at $\\alpha_{2}$ receptors: the antagonist prevents the agonist-induced $G_{i}$ effect, restoring $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ to near baseline. This reinforces that both clonidine’s effect is mediated via $\\alpha_{2}$ receptors and yohimbine effectively blocks that receptor.\n\nIsoproterenol is a $\\beta$-agonist. Under Condition 4, isoproterenol alone produces $3.20$. Since $3.20>1.00$, and this direction and magnitude of change (a robust increase) matches the expected effect of $G_{s}$-coupled $\\beta$-adrenergic receptor activation, this observation supports the presence of functional $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors that can stimulate adenylyl cyclase.\n\nSummarizing the logical implications:\n1) $0.45$ with clonidine alone implies functional $\\alpha_{2}$ receptors coupling to $G_{i}$ are present.\n2) $1.00$ with yohimbine alone implies no inverse agonism and no detectable constitutive $\\alpha_{2}$ activity; yohimbine behaves as a neutral antagonist under these conditions.\n3) $0.98$ with clonidine plus yohimbine implies effective antagonism at $\\alpha_{2}$, confirming the receptor-mediated nature of clonidine’s effect.\n4) $3.20$ with isoproterenol alone implies functional $\\beta$ receptors coupling to $G_{s}$ are present.\n\nThese four findings are simultaneously satisfied only if both $\\alpha_{2}$- and $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors are functionally expressed in these neurons. Therefore, among the provided options, the most strongly supported conclusion is that the neurons express both functional $\\alpha_{2}$- and functional $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors.\n\nThis conclusion directly rules out: A (contradicted by clonidine’s decrease and yohimbine’s blockade), B (contradicted by isoproterenol’s increase), D (contradicted by multiple robust, pharmacologically specific responses), and E (contradicted by yohimbine being neutral at $1.00$ rather than producing an opposite effect, and clonidine clearly having an effect).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2326666"}, {"introduction": "After identifying a receptor, the next step in drug discovery is to quantify the effects of potential new medicines.

However, the intracellular portions are from the human $\\alpha_1$-adrenergic receptor, which canonically couples to the $G_{q/11}$ family rather than $G_{s}$.\n\nUpon agonist binding, the conformational change in the receptor is transmitted to its intracellular domains, which dictate coupling to $G_{q}$. Activated $G_{q}$ stimulates phospholipase C beta, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. The most immediate and primary change in second messengers is therefore a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate also acutely elevates cytosolic calcium by release from intracellular stores.\n\nBy contrast, an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate would require coupling to $G_{s}$ (typical of $\\beta_2$ with native intracellular domains), which this chimera lacks; a decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate would require $G_{i}$ coupling (typical of $\\alpha_2$), which is also absent. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a hallmark of receptor tyrosine kinases, not GPCRs. Given proper expression and folding and the presence of downstream components, no-change is implausible because the receptor will both bind ligand and couple to $G_{q}$.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and primary second messenger change is an increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2326649"}]}
