This exercise provides a direct application of the quantal hypothesis, where you will calculate the number of vesicles released during a nerve impulse.

[@problem_id:2335459]", "problem": "At the neuromuscular junction, the arrival of a nerve impulse triggers the release of acetylcholine from synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft. The binding of acetylcholine to receptors on the muscle fiber's membrane generates a depolarization known as an End-Plate Potential (EPP). Even in the absence of a nerve impulse, single vesicles can spontaneously fuse with the presynaptic membrane, releasing their contents and causing a much smaller depolarization called a Miniature End-Plate Potential (mEPP). The mEPP is considered the fundamental unit, or quantum, of neurotransmitter release.\n\nIn a laboratory experiment on a frog neuromuscular junction, a researcher records the postsynaptic potentials. She finds that the average depolarization caused by a single, spontaneously released vesicle (the mEPP) is 0.5 mV. When she stimulates the presynaptic motor neuron with a single electrical pulse, she observes a resulting EPP with an amplitude of 30 mV.\n\nAssuming that each vesicle contains roughly the same amount of acetylcholine and that the postsynaptic response to each quantum sums linearly, calculate the number of acetylcholine vesicles released by the single nerve impulse to generate the observed EPP.", "solution": "The quantal hypothesis and linear summation assume each vesicle release produces an identical postsynaptic depolarization (a quantum) and the end-plate potential sums these quanta linearly.

Synaptic depression, a form of short-term synaptic plasticity, is the activity-dependent reduction in synaptic strength. Two primary hypotheses are considered for the depression observed after a high-frequency train of stimuli (tetanus):\n1.  **Presynaptic Fatigue**: The depletion of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles and a slow rate of mobilization from the reserve pool, leading to a decrease in the number of vesicles released per action potential.\n2.  **Postsynaptic Desensitization**: A reduction in the responsiveness of postsynaptic nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors (nAChRs) to acetylcholine.\n\nTo distinguish between these possibilities, the researcher records intracellularly from a muscle fiber.
