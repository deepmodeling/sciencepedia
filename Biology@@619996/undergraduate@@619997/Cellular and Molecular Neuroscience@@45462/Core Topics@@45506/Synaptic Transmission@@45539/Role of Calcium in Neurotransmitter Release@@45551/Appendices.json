The scientist injects a specialized fluorescent dye into the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron. This dye has a key property: its fluorescence intensity increases significantly when it binds to free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). The neuron is initially at its resting membrane potential. The extracellular fluid surrounding the neuron has a much higher concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ than the intracellular fluid. The presynaptic terminal membrane is known to contain a high density of voltage-gated calcium channels.\n\nThe scientist then stimulates the axon, causing a single action potential to propagate and arrive at the presynaptic terminal. An instrument is used to measure the total fluorescence from the dye within the terminal.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes best describes the change in fluorescence measured from the presynaptic terminal *immediately* following the arrival of the action potential?\n\nA.

The calcium current is given by Ohm’s law for ionic currents,\n$$\nI_{Ca} = g_{Ca}\\,(V - E_{Ca}),\n$$\nand since during the action potential $V \\ll E_{Ca}$, the driving force $V - E_{Ca}$ is negative, producing an inward $Ca^{2+}$ current and a rapid influx of $Ca^{2+}$. This influx causes a rapid rise in $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ on the millisecond timescale. Because the dye’s fluorescence intensity increases upon binding $Ca^{2+}$, the total fluorescence measured from the terminal will increase promptly following channel opening.

Neurotransmitter release is not just triggered by the presence of calcium, but by its concentration reaching a very high level in a very specific location, for a very brief moment.

A presynaptic nerve terminal is isolated and can be stimulated with a single, brief electrical pulse (less than 1 millisecond) that reliably triggers the release of a quantifiable amount of neurotransmitter.

BAPTA (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid), a chelator with a very fast on-rate for binding free calcium ions.\n2.

A brief electrical pulse opens calcium channels for less than 1 millisecond, creating a steep, transient nanodomain increase in $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ near release sensors. Neurotransmitter release is triggered when $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to the release sensor within a sub-millisecond window after channel opening.\n\nBoth BAPTA and EGTA bind free $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ according to mass-action kinetics:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{CaB}]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][B] - k_{\\text{off}}[\\text{CaB}],\n$$\nwhere $[\\text{CaB}]$ is the calcium-buffer complex, $[B]$ is free buffer, $k_{\\text{on}}$ is the on-rate, and $k_{\\text{off}}$ is the off-rate.

This final practice explores the molecular basis for this diversity, demonstrating that different calcium-sensing proteins mediate these distinct modes. By hypothetically substituting calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) with a similar ion, strontium ($Sr^{2+}$), you will learn how subtle differences in ion binding and sensor kinetics can dramatically reshape the temporal pattern of neurotransmission. [@problem_id:2349918]", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the mechanisms of synaptic transmission at a specialized vertebrate synapse. This synapse exhibits two distinct modes of neurotransmitter release following a presynaptic action potential (AP).\n\n1.  **Synchronous Release**: A rapid, high-magnitude release of neurotransmitter that occurs within 1-2 milliseconds of the AP peak. This process is known to be triggered by a protein sensor that requires a very high, localized concentration of divalent cations to become activated.\n2.  **Asynchronous Release**: A slower, lower-magnitude, and temporally scattered release of neurotransmitter that persists for hundreds of milliseconds after the AP has passed. This process is mediated by a different protein sensor that has a high affinity for divalent cations and is particularly sensitive to the duration that the cation remains bound to it.\n\nIn an experiment, the standard extracellular solution containing a physiological concentration of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) is carefully washed out and replaced by a new solution containing an equimolar concentration of strontium ions ($Sr^{2+}$). It is known that $Sr^{2+}$ can enter the presynaptic terminal through the same voltage-gated channels as $Ca^{2+}$ upon depolarization by an AP.\n\nBased on extensive biochemical studies, the interactions of these ions with the two release sensors are characterized as follows:\n*   For the **synchronous release sensor**, $Sr^{2+}$ has a significantly lower binding affinity than $Ca^{2+}$.\n*   For the **asynchronous release sensor**, $Sr^{2+}$ has a binding affinity comparable to that of $Ca^{2+}$, but its dissociation (unbinding) rate from the sensor is much slower than that of $Ca^{2+}$.\n\nPredict the most likely effect on synchronous and asynchronous neurotransmitter release when an AP is elicited in the presynaptic terminal bathed in the $Sr^{2+}$-containing solution, compared to the normal $Ca^{2+}$-containing solution.\n\nA.

Synchronous release will be enhanced, while asynchronous release will be reduced.\n\nD. Both synchronous and asynchronous release will be abolished.\n\nE. There will be no significant change to either type of release because $Sr^{2+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$ are chemically similar divalent cations.", "solution": "We analyze how replacing extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ with equimolar $Sr^{2+}$ affects two kinetically and mechanistically distinct release modes, given ion-sensor interaction properties.\n\n1) Common entry pathway: Upon a presynaptic action potential (AP), both $Ca^{2+}$ and $Sr^{2+}$ can permeate voltage-gated calcium channels into the presynaptic terminal. Thus, changes in release arise from differential binding kinetics to the release sensors rather than access to the terminal.\n\n2) Synchronous release sensor kinetics: The synchronous sensor requires a very high, brief, local concentration near open channels (a microdomain) and has steep cooperative activation. A standard occupancy model for a binding sensor with cooperativity $n$ is\n$$\nf_{\\text{sync}}([M])=\\frac{[M]^{n}}{K_{d,\\text{sync}}^{n}+[M]^{n}},\n$$\nwhere $M$ denotes the divalent cation species, and $K_{d,\\text{sync}}=k_{\\text{off}}/k_{\\text{on}}$ is the dissociation constant of the sensor for the ion. Given the statement that $Sr^{2+}$ has significantly lower binding affinity than $Ca^{2+}$ for the synchronous sensor, we have\n$$\nK_{d,\\text{sync}}(Sr^{2+}) \\gg K_{d,\\text{sync}}(Ca^{2+}).\n$$\nAt the same microdomain concentration profile $[M](t)$ elicited by an AP, this implies\n$$\nf_{\\text{sync}}([Sr^{2+}]) \\ll f_{\\text{sync}}([Ca^{2+}])\n$$\nduring the critical 1–2 millisecond window. Therefore, the probability of synchronous sensor activation, and hence synchronous release amplitude and probability, are reduced with $Sr^{2+}$.\n\n3) Asynchronous release sensor kinetics: The asynchronous sensor has high affinity for divalent cations and integrates signals over longer timescales. We are told:\n- $Sr^{2+}$ has comparable affinity to $Ca^{2+}$ at the asynchronous sensor, so\n$$\nK_{d,\\text{async}}(Sr^{2+}) \\approx K_{d,\\text{async}}(Ca^{2+}).\n$$\n- The dissociation (unbinding) rate is much slower for $Sr^{2+}$ than for $Ca^{2+}$, i.e.,\n$$\nk_{\\text{off,async}}(Sr^{2+}) \\ll k_{\\text{off,async}}(Ca^{2+}),\n$$\nso the bound-state dwell time\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{bound}}=\\frac{1}{k_{\\text{off}}}\n$$\nis much longer for $Sr^{2+}$. For a brief binding event, the bound fraction decays as\n$$\nP_{\\text{bound}}(t)\\propto \\exp\\!\\big(-k_{\\text{off}} t\\big),\n$$\nso a smaller $k_{\\text{off}}$ yields a more sustained occupancy. Because asynchronous release rate scales with the fraction of sensors occupied over time and their dwell time, a slower unbinding of $Sr^{2+}$ produces more prolonged and typically enhanced asynchronous release following the AP, persisting for hundreds of milliseconds or longer.\n\n4) Synthesis of predictions:\n- Synchronous release: reduced due to lower affinity of the synchronous sensor for $Sr^{2+}$, leading to diminished activation during the brief high-concentration microdomain.\n- Asynchronous release: enhanced and prolonged due to comparable affinity but much slower unbinding from the asynchronous sensor, increasing occupancy duration and effective release over time.\n\n5) Elimination of alternatives:\n- Not both enhanced: synchronous is reduced by lower affinity. \n- Not abolished: $Sr^{2+}$ still enters and can bind sensors, particularly the asynchronous sensor. \n- Not no change: kinetic differences are substantial and known to alter release modes. \n- Synchronous is not enhanced while asynchronous reduced: the stated kinetics predict the opposite.\n\nHence the correct choice is that synchronous release will be reduced, while asynchronous release will be enhanced and prolonged.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2349918"}]}
