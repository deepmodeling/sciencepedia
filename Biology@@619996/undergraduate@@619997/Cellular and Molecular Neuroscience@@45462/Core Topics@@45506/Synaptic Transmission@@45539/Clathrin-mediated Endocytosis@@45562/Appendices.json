This first practice challenges you to design a live-cell imaging experiment, a cornerstone of modern cell biology. By considering how to tag and track specific proteins like cargo receptors and clathrin itself, you will develop an intuition for how colocalization studies provide direct evidence for molecular interactions during cellular trafficking [@problem_id:2331468].", "problem": "A cell biology researcher wants to design an experiment to visually confirm the dynamic colocalization of the Transferrin Receptor (TfR), a cargo receptor, with Clathrin Light Chain (CLC) as endocytic vesicles form at the plasma membrane and are internalized into the cell. The experiment must be conducted on live cultured mammalian cells to observe the entire process in real-time.\n\nWhich of the following experimental strategies is the most direct and appropriate method to achieve this specific goal?\n\nA. Transfect the cells with two separate plasmids: one that encodes for a TfR-Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fusion protein, and another that encodes for a CLC-Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) fusion protein. Then, perform live-cell fluorescence microscopy to look for the appearance of yellow puncta (resulting from the overlap of green and red signals) at the plasma membrane that subsequently move into the cytoplasm.\n\nB.

Then, perform live-cell fluorescence microscopy and track the movement of green puncta from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm.\n\nC. Add transferrin ligand that has been chemically conjugated to a red fluorophore to the cell culture medium.

Therefore, the method must:\n- Visualize both TfR and CLC simultaneously in living cells.\n- Use spectrally separable fluorophores to assess colocalization.\n- Permit time-lapse imaging to track movement from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A uses TfR fused to GFP and CLC fused to RFP, allowing two-color live-cell imaging with distinct channels. Overlap of green and red signals produces yellow puncta, directly reporting spatial colocalization at the plasma membrane and enabling tracking of vesicle internalization in real time. This directly tests dynamic colocalization of the two proteins of interest.\n- Option B uses GFP for both TfR and CLC, producing a single green channel. This prevents distinguishing the two proteins and precludes assessing their colocalization specifically; it cannot address the stated goal.\n- Option C labels transferrin ligand in red and TfR in green, enabling ligand-receptor colocalization but does not label CLC. It cannot directly test TfR-CLC colocalization.\n- Option D uses fixed-cell immunofluorescence, which cannot capture dynamics or real-time internalization, thus not satisfying the live-cell requirement.\n- Option E labels the plasma membrane with a dye and CLC with GFP but does not label TfR; it cannot assess TfR-CLC colocalization.\n\nConclusion: Only Option A provides simultaneous, spectrally separable, live imaging of both TfR and CLC to directly observe dynamic colocalization and internalization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2331468"}, {"introduction": "Having considered how to observe the endocytic pathway, we now explore how to dissect its mechanism using genetic tools, a classic approach in cell biology. The study of temperature-sensitive mutations has been invaluable for identifying the function of essential proteins by allowing scientists to switch them 'on' and 'off'. This problem asks you to predict the outcome of a seminal experiment that incapacitates dynamin, sharpening your ability to link a specific molecular failure to a predictable and observable cellular phenotype [@problem_id:2331434].", "problem": "In the field of cellular neuroscience, the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* serves as a powerful model organism to study synaptic function. A critical process at the presynaptic terminal is clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which recycles the vesicle membrane after neurotransmitter release. This process involves the formation of a clathrin-coated pit on the plasma membrane, which then invaginates and is eventually \"pinched off\" to form a free vesicle in the cytoplasm. The protein dynamin, a large GTPase, is essential for this final pinching-off step.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered strain of *Drosophila* that possesses a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene encoding dynamin. In this mutant, dynamin functions correctly at a permissive temperature of $22^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ but becomes rapidly non-functional at a restrictive temperature of $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nAn experiment is performed on the neuromuscular junction of this mutant fly. The preparation is maintained at the permissive temperature ($22^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) while the presynaptic motor neuron is subjected to continuous high-frequency electrical stimulation to induce sustained neurotransmitter release. Midway through the stimulation period, the temperature of the preparation is rapidly shifted to the restrictive temperature ($30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$). Immediately after the temperature shift, the synapse is chemically fixed and prepared for examination with a Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).\n\nWhich of the following descriptions best characterizes the expected ultrastructural changes at the presynaptic terminal membrane when viewed under TEM, compared to a wild-type fly subjected to the same experimental protocol?\n\nA. An accumulation of deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits that remain connected to the presynaptic plasma membrane, often by a narrow, stalk-like neck.\n\nB. A complete absence of clathrin-coated pits, resulting in an unusually smooth presynaptic membrane despite the ongoing stimulation.\n\nC. A significant reduction in synaptic vesicle fusion events, with a large number of vesicles docked at the active zone but unable to fuse with the membrane.\n\nD. A presynaptic terminal that appears indistinguishable from a wild-type terminal, with a normal balance of endocytic and exocytic structures.\n\nE. The formation of large, unstructured aggregates of clathrin protein within the cytoplasm of the presynaptic terminal, unassociated with the plasma membrane.", "solution": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the presynaptic terminal proceeds through a defined sequence: clathrin triskelia assemble into a coat at the plasma membrane to form a clathrin-coated pit, the pit invaginates, and scission of the narrow neck that connects the coated pit to the plasma membrane is catalyzed by the large GTPase dynamin. After scission, the coated vesicle uncoats and re-enters the synaptic vesicle pool. Thus, dynamin is specifically required for the membrane fission step and acts after clathrin coat assembly and invagination have already occurred.\n\nIn the described temperature-sensitive dynamin mutant, dynamin functions at the permissive temperature $22^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ but becomes non-functional at the restrictive temperature $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. During high-frequency stimulation at the permissive temperature, exocytosis and endocytosis proceed, maintaining vesicle recycling. Upon acute shift to $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, dynamin activity is lost rapidly. Steps of endocytosis upstream of scission—namely clathrin coat assembly and invagination—do not require dynamin and thus continue, but the scission step is blocked. Consequently, clathrin-coated pits will form and invaginate but remain tethered to the plasma membrane via a narrow, stalk-like neck that cannot be severed.\n\nBecause the fixation occurs immediately after the temperature shift, the ultrastructural snapshot will predominantly reveal the accumulation of these arrested intermediates: deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits that remain connected to the presynaptic membrane by narrow necks, with a concomitant reduction in free, fully formed coated vesicles. This is the classic phenotype observed in temperature-sensitive dynamin mutants such as shibire under restrictive conditions.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A matches the expected accumulation of invaginated, membrane-connected clathrin-coated pits due to failed dynamin-mediated scission.\n- Option B is incorrect because coated pits are not absent; they accumulate.\n- Option C is incorrect because dynamin loss primarily impairs endocytosis, not the fusion machinery; any reduction in fusion would be secondary and delayed due to vesicle pool depletion, not immediate inability to fuse.\n- Option D is incorrect because the restrictive shift produces a characteristic endocytic block with visible intermediates.\n- Option E is incorrect because clathrin assembles at the membrane; large unstructured cytoplasmic aggregates are not the hallmark of dynamin inactivation at this timescale.\n\nThus, the best description is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2331434"}, {"introduction": "The life cycle of a vesicle doesn't end with scission; the clathrin coat must be shed before the vesicle can deliver its cargo or be refilled and reused. This final practice focuses on this critical uncoating step, which is tightly regulated by enzymatic signaling on the vesicle membrane. By analyzing the effect of inhibiting the lipid phosphatase synaptojanin, you will appreciate how biochemical signaling orchestrates the disassembly of the protein coat, a vital step for completing the vesicle cycle [@problem_id:2331435].", "problem": "In a neuroscience research laboratory, a team is investigating the molecular machinery of synaptic vesicle recycling via Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis (CME). The process begins with the recruitment of adaptor proteins and clathrin to the presynaptic terminal membrane, followed by the formation of an invaginated coated pit, scission of the vesicle from the membrane by the GTPase dynamin, and finally, uncoating of the clathrin lattice to release a \"naked\" vesicle ready for refilling with neurotransmitter.\n\nA crucial regulator of this process is the lipid Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ($PI(4,5)P_2$), which is enriched at the plasma membrane and acts as a docking site for adaptor proteins, thereby initiating coat assembly. The removal of $PI(4,5)P_2$ from the newly formed vesicle membrane is a prerequisite for the uncoating step. This lipid turnover is primarily mediated by the enzyme synaptojanin, which possesses a 5'-phosphatase domain that converts $PI(4,5)P_2$ to $PI(4)P$.\n\nThe researchers treat cultured cortical neurons with a novel experimental drug, \"Synapto-Lock,\" which is a potent and highly specific inhibitor of the 5'-phosphatase activity of synaptojanin. The drug does not affect any other enzymatic activities, including the function of dynamin or the ATPase activity of the uncoating chaperone Hsc70. The neurons are then stimulated electrically to trigger a bout of neurotransmitter release and subsequent compensatory endocytosis.\n\nBased on your understanding of the CME pathway, predict the predominant morphological phenotype of clathrin-related structures that would be observed at the presynaptic terminals of these drug-treated neurons using electron microscopy.\n\nA. An accumulation of shallow, clathrin-coated pits that fail to invaginate.\n\nB. A complete absence of clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane.\n\nC. An accumulation of deeply invaginated, clathrin-coated pits tethered to the presynaptic membrane by a narrow neck.\n\nD. An accumulation of free, fully-formed vesicles in the cytoplasm that remain coated with clathrin.\n\nE. An accumulation of free, uncoated synaptic vesicles in the cytoplasm, indistinguishable from a normal state.", "solution": "We proceed by mapping each mechanistic step in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) to the specific molecular requirements and then predicting the morphological consequence of selectively inhibiting synaptojanin's 5-prime phosphatase.\n\n1. Coat initiation and pit formation: $PI(4,5)P_2$ at the plasma membrane provides docking sites for adaptor proteins such as AP-2 and other endocytic factors. These adaptors recruit clathrin triskelia, promoting assembly of a clathrin lattice and curvature. Because the experimental drug targets only synaptojanin's 5-prime phosphatase and does not deplete $PI(4,5)P_2$ at the plasma membrane, adaptor recruitment and pit formation proceed normally.\n\n2. Invagination and scission: Continued lattice assembly produces deeply invaginated coated pits. Scission is catalyzed by dynamin, a GTPase. The problem states dynamin function is unaffected by the drug, so coated pits undergo normal scission to produce free, newly endocytosed vesicles.\n\n3. Lipid remodeling prerequisite for uncoating: After scission, uncoating requires two coordinated events:\n   - Conversion of $PI(4,5)P_2$ to $PI(4)P$ on the vesicle membrane by synaptojanin's 5-prime phosphatase. This lipid switch reduces the membrane affinity of many endocytic adaptors and accessory proteins that specifically bind $PI(4,5)P_2$.\n   - ATP-dependent clathrin coat disassembly by Hsc70 (with cofactors such as auxilin), which is facilitated when adaptors and cargo release due to $PI(4,5)P_2$ depletion.\n\n4. Effect of Synapto-Lock: By selectively inhibiting synaptojanin's 5-prime phosphatase, $PI(4,5)P_2$ persists on the membrane of the newly formed vesicle. This sustains high-affinity binding of AP-2 and other $PI(4,5)P_2$-dependent coat components, thereby preventing efficient recruitment or action of the uncoating machinery. Even though Hsc70 ATPase activity is intact, the persistent $PI(4,5)P_2$-adaptor interactions maintain the clathrin coat and stabilize the coated state.\n\n5. Predicted morphological phenotype by electron microscopy: Because scission is normal but uncoating is impaired, the predominant structures that accumulate are free, fully formed vesicles in the cytoplasm that remain clathrin-coated.\n\n6. Elimination of alternatives:\n   - A (shallow pits): would result from failure in early adaptor/clathrin recruitment or curvature generation, which is not impaired here.\n   - B (absence of coated structures): would require a block in coat initiation or assembly, not present here.\n   - C (deeply invaginated pits with necks): is characteristic of dynamin inhibition; dynamin is unaffected.\n   - E (free, uncoated vesicles): would require successful lipid remodeling and uncoating, which are blocked by synaptojanin inhibition.\n\nTherefore, the expected predominant phenotype is an accumulation of free, fully formed clathrin-coated vesicles in the cytoplasm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2331435"}]}
