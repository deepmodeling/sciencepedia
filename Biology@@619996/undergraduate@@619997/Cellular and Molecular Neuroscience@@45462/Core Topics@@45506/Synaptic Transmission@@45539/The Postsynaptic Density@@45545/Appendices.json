This exercise challenges you to think like a biochemist, asking you to identify the critical first step for isolating the PSD's protein scaffold from the surrounding synaptic membranes [@problem_id:2353500]. Solving this requires an understanding of the key biophysical properties that distinguish the detergent-resistant protein matrix of the PSD from the soluble lipid bilayer.", "problem": "A neuroscientist aims to perform a classic biochemical fractionation to isolate the postsynaptic density (PSD), a highly complex and protein-rich structure found at excitatory synapses. The starting material is a synaptosomal fraction, which consists of resealed nerve terminals containing both presynaptic and postsynaptic elements, purified from a rat brain homogenate. The isolation strategy hinges on exploiting the distinct biophysical properties of the PSD relative to the lipid membranes in which it is embedded.\n\nWhich of the following experimental steps is the crucial first action to specifically separate the core protein scaffold of the PSD from the surrounding synaptic membranes?\n\nA. Treatment with a mild non-ionic detergent, such as Triton X-100.\n\nB. Sonication in the presence of a strong ionic detergent, such as Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS).\n\nC. Incubation with magnetic beads conjugated to an antibody against the scaffolding protein PSD-95.\n\nD. High-speed ultracentrifugation on a continuous sucrose density gradient without any chemical treatment.\n\nE. Application of a high-salt buffer (e.g., 1 M KCl) to dissociate peripheral membrane proteins.", "solution": "Goal: separate the detergent-resistant core protein scaffold of the postsynaptic density (PSD) from the surrounding synaptic lipid membranes in a synaptosomal fraction.\n\nPrinciple: The PSD is a dense, crosslinked, proteinaceous scaffold that is relatively resistant to extraction by mild non-ionic detergents at low temperature, whereas lipid bilayers and many membrane-associated proteins are readily solubilized by such detergents through the formation of mixed micelles. Therefore, selectively solubilizing the surrounding membranes while leaving the PSD intact and insoluble is the crucial first action to biochemically separate the PSD core from membranes.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A. Mild non-ionic detergents (e.g., Triton X-100) at low temperature solubilize synaptic lipid membranes and many membrane proteins, while the PSD protein matrix remains insoluble (Triton-insoluble fraction). This is the classic first step in PSD isolation from synaptosomes, enabling subsequent pelleting of the PSD.\n- B. Strong ionic detergents (e.g., Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate) denature and solubilize essentially all proteins, destroying the native PSD scaffold and preventing selective isolation.\n- C. Antibody-based pull-down (e.g., against PSD-95) is an affinity purification strategy targeting a single antigen and is not the initial biochemical fractionation step to separate the entire PSD scaffold from membranes; it biases composition and depends on epitope accessibility.\n- D. High-speed ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradients without prior chemical extraction does not separate the PSD core from its membrane association, as the PSD remains embedded in membranes; thus this is insufficient as the first separating action.\n- E. High-salt extraction removes peripheral membrane proteins by disrupting electrostatic interactions but does not solubilize lipid bilayers; it will not selectively separate the PSD scaffold from membranes and may strip desired peripheral components.\n\nTherefore, the crucial first action is treatment with a mild non-ionic detergent to solubilize membranes while retaining the PSD as an insoluble scaffold.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2353500"}, {"introduction": "The PSD is not a static scaffold but a dynamic entity in a constant state of flux, maintained by a delicate balance of protein synthesis and degradation. This practice presents a thought experiment to explore the crucial concept of protein turnover [@problem_id:2353484]. By considering the long-term consequences of halting protein production, you will develop a deeper appreciation for why this continuous renewal is fundamental to the structural integrity and function of the synapse.", "problem": "The postsynaptic density (PSD) is a highly organized, electron-dense protein complex situated just inside the postsynaptic membrane of an excitatory synapse. This structure is critical for anchoring neurotransmitter receptors and modulating synaptic signaling. The constituent proteins of the PSD are continuously synthesized and degraded, a process known as protein turnover, which allows the synapse to adapt and change over time.\n\nConsider a mature, stable neuron in a cell culture. This neuron is chronically treated with a drug that acts as a potent and specific inhibitor of ribosomal translation, effectively halting all new protein synthesis within the cell. However, the normal cellular machinery responsible for protein degradation remains fully functional. Based on this information, what is the most likely long-term outcome for the structural integrity of the PSD in this treated neuron?\n\nA. The PSD will become significantly larger and more dense due to the accumulation and aggregation of existing, unmodified proteins.\n\nB. The PSD's structure and size will remain largely unchanged, as it is a permanent, static scaffold essential for cell viability.\n\nC. The PSD will be selectively protected from degradation by a special mechanism, while other cellular proteins are degraded.\n\nD. The PSD will gradually shrink in size and may eventually disassemble completely.", "solution": "Define $N(t)$ as the total amount of PSD structural proteins (or an integral measure of PSD mass/structure) at time $t$. In a mature, stable neuron under steady-state conditions, PSD proteins undergo continuous turnover governed by the balance between synthesis and degradation. Let the synthesis rate be a constant $s$ (units: amount per time) and the degradation be first-order with rate constant $k$ (units: per time), so that the loss rate is $kN(t)$. The standard kinetic equation for protein turnover is\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = s - kN.\n$$\nIn a stable steady state prior to drug treatment, $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$, hence\n$$\n0 = s - kN_{\\text{ss}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad N_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{s}{k}.\n$$\nThe drug is a potent and specific inhibitor of ribosomal translation, so it effectively sets the synthesis term to zero at the time of treatment: $s = 0$. The degradation machinery remains fully functional, so the post-treatment dynamics obey\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = -kN.\n$$\nThis first-order decay has the solution\n$$\nN(t) = N(0)\\,\\exp(-kt),\n$$\nwhere $N(0)$ is the PSD protein amount at the onset of translation inhibition. As $t \\to \\infty$, $\\exp(-kt) \\to 0$, so\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} N(t) = 0.\n$$\nPhysiologically, the PSD is a dynamic structure requiring continuous replacement of its constituent proteins to maintain its architecture and receptor anchoring capacity. With synthesis halted and degradation ongoing, the pool of PSD proteins will monotonically decrease, leading to progressive loss of scaffold components, decreased receptor anchoring, and structural shrinkage, with possible eventual disassembly if the deficit becomes sufficiently severe.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct. Options A, B, and C are inconsistent with the turnover kinetics and known biology: A cannot occur without synthesis and in the presence of ongoing degradation; B incorrectly treats the PSD as a static, permanent scaffold rather than a turnover-dependent structure; C posits selective protection not supported by the premise or by general proteostasis principles for PSD proteins.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2353484"}, {"introduction": "The dynamic turnover of PSD proteins is the molecular basis for synaptic plasticity, which allows neural circuits to adapt and learn.

The synapse's strength is primarily determined by its postsynaptic density (PSD), a protein complex that anchors receptors. For this model, we consider two main functional classes of proteins in the PSD:\n1.  **Core scaffold proteins:** These proteins, like PSD-95, form the structural backbone of the PSD.\n2.  **AMPA receptor 'slot' proteins:** These proteins, such as Transmembrane AMPA Receptor Regulatory Proteins (TARPs), are directly associated with AMPA-type glutamate receptors and are thought to determine the number of receptors that can be held at the synapse.\n\nIn an experiment, chronic network silencing is induced, causing the synapse to undergo homeostatic up-scaling to increase its sensitivity. Measurements reveal the following changes after the up-scaling process is complete:\n-   The total quantity of core scaffold proteins in the PSD increases by $32.0\\%$.\n-   The total quantity of AMPA receptor 'slot' proteins increases by $85.0\\%$.\n\nLet the initial state be before silencing and the final state be after up-scaling.
