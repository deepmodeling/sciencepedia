This process is not a simple merging of lipids; it is driven by a precise molecular engine, the SNARE complex. This first exercise [@problem_id:2353573] uses a classic neurotoxin thought experiment to probe the absolute necessity of this machinery, forcing a clear distinction between the components required for vesicle fusion and those involved in other aspects of synaptic function.", "problem": "The release of neurotransmitters from a presynaptic terminal is a highly orchestrated process involving the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane at a region known as the active zone. This fusion is mediated by a set of proteins called the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor (SNARE) complex. This complex is formed by the interaction of a vesicle-SNARE (v-SNARE) protein, located on the synaptic vesicle membrane, with two target-SNARE (t-SNARE) proteins, located on the presynaptic plasma membrane. The three key proteins are synaptobrevin (the v-SNARE), and syntaxin and SNAP-25 (the t-SNAREs). The formation of this complex brings the two membranes into close proximity, priming the vesicle for fusion, which is ultimately triggered by the influx of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) following an action potential.\n\nImagine you are studying a motor neuron that is being stimulated to fire action potentials at a regular frequency. You then introduce a newly discovered neurotoxin that acts as a highly specific protease, cleaving the t-SNARE protein syntaxin and rendering it unable to interact with synaptobrevin and SNAP-25. All other cellular components, including voltage-gated calcium channels, the calcium sensor synaptotagmin, and the vesicles themselves, remain unaffected.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most immediate and direct consequence of this neurotoxin's activity on the presynaptic terminal?\n\nA. An explosive, uncontrolled release of neurotransmitter, independent of action potentials.\n\nB. A near-complete blockage of neurotransmitter release, even when action potentials cause calcium influx.\n\nC. The uncoupling of neurotransmitter release from calcium, causing release to occur spontaneously.\n\nD. Synaptic vesicles will be unable to be recycled and refilled with neurotransmitter after fusion.\n\nE. Synaptic vesicles will fail their initial tethering to the active zone, floating freely within the terminal.", "solution": "Exocytosis of synaptic vesicles at the active zone requires assembly of the core SNARE complex formed by one v-SNARE (synaptobrevin) and two t-SNAREs (syntaxin and SNAP-25). In the primed, fusion-competent state, these SNAREs form a parallel, four-helix bundle that brings the vesicle and plasma membranes into nanometer proximity. Upon an action potential, voltage-gated calcium channels open and the influx of $Ca^{2+}$ binds to synaptotagmin, which catalyzes the final zippering and membrane merger. Thus, both a competent SNARE complex and the $Ca^{2+}$ trigger are necessary for evoked fusion.\n\nThe introduced neurotoxin specifically cleaves syntaxin and prevents it from interacting with synaptobrevin and SNAP-25. This prevents formation of the ternary SNARE complex. Without an intact SNARE bundle, vesicles cannot complete priming and cannot undergo $Ca^{2+}$-triggered fusion, even though voltage-gated calcium channels, synaptotagmin, and vesicles are otherwise intact. Therefore, the most immediate and direct effect is a near-complete block of neurotransmitter release in response to action potentials.\n\nConsidering the alternatives:\n- Option A is incorrect because removing a core fusion component does not cause uncontrolled release; it prevents fusion.\n- Option C is incorrect because uncoupling from $Ca^{2+}$ would require altering the $Ca^{2+}$ sensor or fusion control, not abolishing the SNARE machinery.\n- Option D is incorrect because vesicle recycling depends on endocytic proteins (e.g., clathrin, dynamin); moreover, the principal immediate effect of syntaxin cleavage is to prevent fusion, not recycling after fusion.\n- Option E is less direct; initial tethering and docking involve additional scaffolds (e.g., RIM, Munc13, Munc18, Rabs). While syntaxin participates in docking/priming, the defining, immediate block is on SNARE-mediated fusion, leading to loss of evoked release.\n\nHence, the correct choice is a near-complete blockage of neurotransmitter release despite $Ca^{2+}$ influx.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2353573"}, {"introduction": "While the SNARE complex provides the power for fusion, uncontrolled fusion would be disastrous for neural communication. Neurons employ accessory proteins to regulate the SNAREs, ensuring release happens at the right time. This practice challenge [@problem_id:2353522] focuses on the protein complexin, a key regulator that both \"clamps\" spontaneous release and promotes rapid, evoked release, asking you to quantify the consequences of disrupting this critical balance.", "problem": "At a central glutamatergic synapse, neurotransmitter release is tightly regulated by the interplay of several proteins. The protein complexin has a dual role: it \"clamps\" the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor (SNARE) complex to prevent premature vesicle fusion, and it also promotes rapid, synchronous fusion upon calcium influx.\n\nConsider a wild-type (WT) neuron where the average frequency of spontaneous vesicle fusion events (spontaneous release) is $f_{m,WT} = 0.040$ Hz. When this neuron is driven by a train of action potentials at a constant frequency of $f_{AP} = 8.0$ Hz, the mean number of vesicles released per action potential (quantal content) is $q = 5$.\n\nNow, imagine a genetically engineered neuron expressing a mutant form of complexin. This mutation completely abolishes complexin's clamping function, causing a 120-fold increase in the frequency of spontaneous vesicle fusion. However, its function in promoting synchronous, calcium-triggered fusion is perfectly preserved, meaning the quantal content for action potential-evoked release remains unchanged.\n\nFor this mutant neuron, when stimulated at the same frequency of $f_{AP} = 8.0$ Hz, calculate the ratio of the average rate of spontaneous vesicle release to the average rate of evoked vesicle release.

The mutation abolishes the clamping function and causes a $120$-fold increase in spontaneous release frequency, while leaving evoked release unchanged.

This stimulation triggers vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.\n\nWe can model the dynamics of the RRP size, $N(t)$, under the following assumptions:\n1.  The rate of vesicle fusion and release is directly proportional to the number of vesicles currently in the RRP, $N(t)$, the frequency of action potentials, $f$, and the probability of release, $p$, for a single vesicle per action potential.\n2.  To counteract this depletion, vesicles are moved from a large reserve pool to replenish the RRP. This replenishment occurs at a constant rate of $k_{rep}$ vesicles per unit time. This rate is not sufficient to keep up with the initial rate of release.\n\nBased on this model, derive an expression for the number of vesicles in the readily releasable pool, $N(t)$, as a function of time $t$ during the high-frequency stimulation.
