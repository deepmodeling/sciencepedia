This problem explores a classic experimental technique known as dye-coupling, which provides powerful visual evidence for the presence of gap junctions. By reasoning through why a small fluorescent molecule can spread from one neuron to its neighbors, you will solidify your understanding of the fundamental structural property that defines these connections: the direct cytoplasmic continuity between coupled cells [@problem_id:2335174].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating a network of unidentified neurons grown in a culture. To probe the connections between them, the scientist performs a microinjection experiment. A single neuron, designated Neuron 1, is impaled with a microelectrode and injected with a solution containing Lucifer yellow, a small, water-soluble fluorescent dye with a molecular weight of approximately 457 Daltons. After a few minutes, the scientist uses a fluorescence microscope and observes that not only is Neuron 1 brightly fluorescent, but several neurons that are in direct physical contact with Neuron 1 are also weakly fluorescent. Assuming the experimental procedure was performed correctly without lysing any cells, which of the following is the most direct conclusion about the nature of the connections between Neuron 1 and its fluorescent neighbors?\n\nA. The neurons are connected by chemical synapses, where the dye is packaged into vesicles and released into the synaptic cleft.\n\nB. The neurons are connected by gap junctions, which permit the direct passage of small molecules from one cell's cytoplasm to the next.\n\nC. The neurons are linked by specialized desmosomes that contain pores large enough for the dye to pass through.\n\nD. The neurons are connected by tight junctions, forming a seal that inadvertently allows small molecules like Lucifer yellow to leak between cells.\n\nE. The injection of the dye triggered a series of action potentials that caused the fluorescent neighbors to synthesize their own Lucifer yellow.", "solution": "1. Observation: After microinjecting Lucifer yellow into Neuron 1, fluorescence appears in Neuron 1 and weakly in several directly contacting neighbor neurons, with cells not lysed.\n2. Relevant properties: Lucifer yellow is small (approximately 457 Daltons), water-soluble, and membrane-impermeant; therefore, it does not cross intact plasma membranes by diffusion and does not enter vesicles from the cytosol under typical conditions.\n3. Necessary mechanism: For dye to appear in neighboring intact cells, there must be direct cytoplasmic continuity permitting the passage of small molecules between cells.\n4. Known pathway: Gap junctions form intercellular channels (connexons) that connect cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm and permit diffusion of small molecules and ions generally up to roughly 1 kilodalton. A molecule of approximately 457 Daltons can traverse these channels, explaining the weak fluorescence (dilution) in neighboring cells.\n5. Exclusion of alternatives:\n   - Chemical synapses (A): Neurotransmitters are packaged into vesicles in the presynaptic terminal; a cytosolic dye injected into the soma is not selectively packaged into synaptic vesicles or released into the cleft in a manner that would lead to uptake by the postsynaptic cytoplasm. Moreover, postsynaptic membranes do not provide a route for cytosolic dye entry.\n   - Desmosomes (C): These are mechanical adhesion structures without pores connecting cytoplasms; they do not permit small molecule passage.\n   - Tight junctions (D): These form paracellular seals that restrict, not permit, diffusion between cells, and do not connect cytoplasms.\n   - Neighbor synthesis (E): Lucifer yellow is an exogenous dye; action potentials do not induce its biosynthesis in neurons.\n6. Conclusion: The most direct interpretation is that Neuron 1 and its fluorescent neighbors are electrically coupled via gap junctions that allow Lucifer yellow to pass directly from cytoplasm to cytoplasm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2335174"}, {"introduction": "Once an electrical synapse is identified, the next critical step is to quantify its functional strength. This exercise introduces a key metric, the coupling coefficient, which measures the efficiency of voltage transfer from a presynaptic to a postsynaptic neuron. Calculating this fundamental value allows neuroscientists to characterize and compare the efficacy of different electrical connections, providing insight into how much a signal is attenuated as it passes through a gap junction [@problem_id:2335239].", "problem": "In the central nervous system, certain populations of neurons communicate directly through electrical synapses, which are formed by gap junctions. These junctions allow for the passive flow of ionic current between cells, leading to a rapid but attenuated transmission of voltage signals. Consider an experiment on two electrically coupled neurons, a presynaptic neuron and a postsynaptic neuron, being monitored simultaneously. A current injection into the presynaptic neuron causes its membrane potential to depolarize by an amount $\\Delta V_{\\text{pre}} = 25.0$ mV. This change in the presynaptic voltage results in a corresponding, smaller depolarization of $\\Delta V_{\\text{post}} = 3.75$ mV in the postsynaptic neuron.\n\nCalculate the coupling coefficient for this electrical synapse. The coupling coefficient is a dimensionless measure of the synapse's strength. Provide your answer as a decimal value.", "solution": "The coupling coefficient for an electrical synapse is defined as the ratio of the postsynaptic voltage change to the presynaptic voltage change:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{post}}}{\\Delta V_{\\text{pre}}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, with consistent units that cancel,\n$$\nk = \\frac{3.75\\ \\text{mV}}{25.0\\ \\text{mV}} = \\frac{3.75}{25.0} = 0.15.\n$$\nThus, the coupling coefficient is dimensionless and equal to $0.15$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.15}$$", "id": "2335239"}, {"introduction": "To move from measurement to prediction, neuroscientists often represent biological systems with mathematical models. This practice introduces the powerful approach of using equivalent electrical circuits to model electrically coupled neurons, a cornerstone of quantitative cellular biophysics. By applying basic circuit laws to a simplified model, you will derive an expression for the steady-state voltage response of a neuron to current injection, revealing how the interplay between membrane and junctional properties governs the system's behavior [@problem_id:2335226].", "problem": "Two electrically coupled neurons, Neuron 1 and Neuron 2, can be modeled as a simplified electrical circuit. Both neurons are considered identical. The passive electrical properties of each neuron's membrane are represented by a membrane resistance $R_m$ in parallel with a membrane capacitance $C_m$. The two neurons are connected by a gap junction, which is modeled as a single junctional resistance, $R_j$.\n\nAt time $t=0$, a constant current of magnitude $I_{inj}$ is injected into Neuron 1. This injection continues for a very long time, allowing the membrane potentials of both neurons to reach new steady-state values.
