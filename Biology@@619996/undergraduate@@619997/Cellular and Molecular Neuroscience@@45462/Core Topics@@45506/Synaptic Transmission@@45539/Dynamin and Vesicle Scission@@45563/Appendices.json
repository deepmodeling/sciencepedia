This exercise [@problem_id:2334959] presents a classic thought experiment where dynamin's \"power stroke\"—the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP—is disabled using a non-hydrolyzable analog. By predicting the resulting cellular structure, you can pinpoint the precise moment at which dynamin's energy-consuming step drives the final scission of a vesicle from the plasma membrane.", "problem": "In neuronal communication, synaptic vesicles must be recycled after fusing with the presynaptic membrane to release neurotransmitters. This recycling occurs through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process where a protein named dynamin plays a critical role. Dynamin is a large GTPase, which means it functions by binding and hydrolyzing Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP). An experiment is conducted on a neuronal cell culture to investigate this mechanism. The cells are treated with GTPγS, a specific chemical analog of GTP. This analog binds to dynamin with high affinity but is resistant to hydrolysis, meaning dynamin cannot break it down into GDP.\n\nAssuming the treatment effectively introduces GTPγS into the presynaptic terminals, which of the following outcomes would most likely be observed upon examining the terminals with an electron microscope?\n\nA. A complete halt in the formation of coated pits, resulting in a smooth presynaptic membrane with no invaginations.\n\nB. An accelerated rate of vesicle scission, leading to an excess of free-floating synaptic vesicles in the cytoplasm.\n\nC. The accumulation of deeply invaginated, clathrin-coated pits that are connected to the plasma membrane by a narrow stalk, around which dynamin is assembled.\n\nD. The complete failure of dynamin to bind to the membrane, causing it to remain dispersed throughout the presynaptic cytoplasm.\n\nE. A massive fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, unrelated to the recycling pathway.", "solution": "Dynamin is a large GTPase essential for the scission step of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The sequence of events is: clathrin and adaptor proteins drive coated pit formation and invagination; dynamin is recruited to the neck of the deeply invaginated coated pit; GTP binding promotes dynamin assembly into a helical collar around the neck; GTP hydrolysis then drives a conformational change that constricts the neck and catalyzes membrane fission to release a free vesicle.\n\nGTP-gamma-S is a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP that binds dynamin with high affinity but cannot be hydrolyzed. Treating presynaptic terminals with GTP-gamma-S therefore locks dynamin in the GTP-bound state: dynamin can still bind membranes and assemble at the neck of coated pits, but it cannot hydrolyze GTP and thus cannot execute the hydrolysis-dependent conformational change required for scission.\n\nBecause clathrin coat assembly and pit invagination occur upstream of dynamin’s hydrolysis step, these steps proceed; dynamin recruitment also proceeds. The specific block is at vesicle fission. The expected ultrastructural consequence is an accumulation of deeply invaginated, clathrin-coated pits that remain connected to the plasma membrane by a narrow stalk, with dynamin assembled as collars around these necks.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because coated pit formation does not require dynamin GTP hydrolysis.\n- B is incorrect because scission is impaired, not accelerated.\n- C is correct as it describes the fission block with dynamin collars at narrow necks.\n- D is incorrect because dynamin can still bind and assemble when GTP hydrolysis is blocked.\n- E is unrelated to the endocytic defect caused by inhibiting dynamin’s GTP hydrolysis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2334959"}, {"introduction": "While energy from GTP hydrolysis is essential, it's not the whole story; a motor also needs the right structure to apply force. This practice [@problem_id:2334919] moves beyond the energy source to explore the mechanical importance of dynamin's physical assembly into a polymer. By considering a hypothetical mutant that cannot form its characteristic helical collar, you can dissect the relationship between protein structure and the generation of scission force, revealing that dynamin is both an engine and a scaffold.", "problem": "In the process of synaptic vesicle recycling via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the protein dynamin plays a crucial role. Dynamin is a large Guanosine Triphosphatase (GTPase) that is recruited to the neck of a newly formed clathrin-coated bud on the presynaptic membrane. Upon recruitment, individual dynamin molecules assemble into a helical polymer that wraps around the membrane neck. The hydrolysis of GTP by this dynamin collar is thought to induce a conformational change that generates the mechanical force necessary to sever the vesicle from the plasma membrane, a process known as scission.\n\nImagine a genetically engineered neuron that exclusively expresses a mutant form of dynamin. This mutant protein has the following properties: it can be recruited to the membrane neck, it can bind GTP, and it can correctly hydrolyze GTP. However, a specific mutation prevents it from polymerizing into the functional helical collar around the vesicle neck.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most likely and immediate consequence of this specific dynamin mutation for the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the neuron's presynaptic terminal?\n\nA. Synaptic vesicles will successfully form and pinch off from the membrane, but will be unable to shed their clathrin coat in the cytoplasm.\n\nB. The initial assembly of adapter proteins and clathrin into a coated pit on the presynaptic membrane will be blocked.\n\nC. Clathrin-coated pits will form and invaginate, but they will become arrested as deeply invaginated structures that fail to detach from the presynaptic membrane.\n\nD. The fusion of already-formed synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane during neurotransmitter release (exocytosis) will be directly inhibited.\n\nE. The mutant dynamin will fail to hydrolyze GTP, causing it to accumulate at the vesicle neck without causing scission.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most direct consequence of a dynamin mutation that prevents its polymerization into a helical collar, while leaving its other functions like membrane recruitment and GTP hydrolysis intact. To determine the correct answer, we must analyze the specific step in clathrin-mediated endocytosis that requires dynamin polymerization.\n\n1.  **Analyze the normal sequence of events in clathrin-mediated endocytosis:**\n    *   Step 1: Cargo binds to receptors, leading to the recruitment of adaptor proteins.\n    *   Step 2: Clathrin triskelions are recruited and assemble into a lattice, forming a \"coated pit\" that begins to invaginate the plasma membrane.\n    *   Step 3: The pit deepens into a bud, which remains connected to the plasma membrane by a thin \"neck\" of membrane.\n    *   Step 4: Dynamin is recruited to this neck.\n    *   Step 5: Dynamin molecules **polymerize** into a helical ring or collar around the membrane neck.\n    *   Step 6: Through a mechanism coupled with GTP hydrolysis, the dynamin collar constricts and/or elongates, generating the mechanical force that severs the membrane neck. This is the scission event.\n    *   Step 7: A free clathrin-coated vesicle is released into the cytosol.\n    *   Step 8: The vesicle is subsequently \"uncoated\" by other proteins (like Hsc70 and auxilin) to be refilled with neurotransmitter.\n\n2.  **Analyze the effect of the specific mutation:**\n    *   The problem states that the mutant dynamin can be recruited to the neck (Step 4 occurs), can bind GTP, and can hydrolyze GTP.\n    *   The crucial defect is the inability to **polymerize** (Step 5 fails).\n    *   Since polymerization is the prerequisite for generating the scission force, Step 6 (scission) cannot occur.\n    *   Therefore, the process will proceed normally up to the point just before scission. The cell will successfully form deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits, but these structures will be unable to detach from the plasma membrane. They will remain tethered by the membrane neck, which is where the functional, polymerized dynamin collar would have acted.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the given options based on this analysis:**\n\n    *   **A. Synaptic vesicles will successfully form and pinch off from the membrane, but will be unable to shed their clathrin coat in the cytoplasm.** This is incorrect. The primary function of dynamin is to \"pinch off\" the vesicle (scission). If dynamin is non-functional in its core mechanical role, scission will not occur. Uncoating is a later, separate step that happens after a vesicle has been successfully formed.\n\n    *   **B. The initial assembly of adapter proteins and clathrin into a coated pit on the presynaptic membrane will be blocked.** This is incorrect. Dynamin acts late in the process, at the neck of an already-formed bud. The initial formation of the clathrin coat is an upstream event that is independent of dynamin function.\n\n    *   **C. Clathrin-coated pits will form and invaginate, but they will become arrested as deeply invaginated structures that fail to detach from the presynaptic membrane.** This is correct. It precisely describes the outcome of a failed scission event. All preceding steps (pit formation, invagination, dynamin recruitment to the neck) occur, but the final detachment is blocked because the non-polymerizing dynamin cannot generate the necessary force. This leads to an accumulation of \"stuck\" vesicle buds.\n\n    *   **D. The fusion of already-formed synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane during neurotransmitter release (exocytosis) will be directly inhibited.** This is incorrect. Dynamin is involved in endocytosis (taking material *in*, recycling vesicles), not exocytosis (releasing material *out*). While a long-term failure in recycling would deplete the vesicle pool and indirectly affect exocytosis, the direct and immediate effect of the mutation is on endocytosis.\n\n    *   **E. The mutant dynamin will fail to hydrolyze GTP, causing it to accumulate at the vesicle neck without causing scission.** This is incorrect because the problem statement explicitly says the mutant protein *can* correctly hydrolyze GTP. This option describes a different type of dynamin mutation (e.g., one involving a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog like GTPγS), not the one described in the problem. The failure here is in polymerization, not GTPase activity itself.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the outcome is the arrest of vesicle formation just prior to the scission step.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2334919"}, {"introduction": "Scientific inquiry often involves distinguishing between competing, quantitative models of reality. This advanced practice challenges you to think like a biophysicist about a central debate: is dynamin primarily a \"curvature sensor\" that recognizes bends in the membrane, or a \"curvature generator\" that actively creates them?

These nanotubes are stabilized by Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain proteins and serve as mimics for the neck of a budding vesicle. The molar Gibbs free energy of assembly, $\\Delta G$, is determined from the effective dissociation constant ($K_D$) for dynamin polymerization on these tubes via the relation $\\Delta G = RT \\ln(K_D)$.\n\nTwo competing hypotheses are proposed to model the dependence of $\\Delta G$ on the nanotube radius $R$:\n\n1.  **The Curvature Sensor Hypothesis:** Dynamin preferentially binds to pre-existing curved membranes.
