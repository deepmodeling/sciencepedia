By considering the consequences of a non-functional GABA transporter, you will develop a strong conceptual understanding of why rapid clearance is essential for precise temporal signaling in the brain. This exercise highlights the fundamental principle that signal termination is just as important as signal initiation in synaptic communication. [@problem_id:2346139]", "problem": "In the central nervous system, synaptic transmission is a tightly regulated process. For inhibitory synapses using gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the signal is terminated primarily by the rapid reuptake of GABA from the synaptic cleft back into the presynaptic neuron and surrounding glial cells. This reuptake is mediated by a specific protein, the GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1). A secondary, much slower clearance mechanism is the enzymatic degradation of GABA by the intracellular enzyme GABA transaminase (GABA-T) after reuptake has occurred.\n\nImagine a newly discovered genetic condition that results in the synthesis of a non-functional GAT-1 protein, effectively eliminating the primary reuptake mechanism for GABA. All other components of the synapse, including GABA synthesis, vesicular release, postsynaptic receptors, and GABA-T, are initially functioning normally.\n\nBased on this scenario, which of the following statements describes the most immediate and direct consequence for GABAergic neurotransmission?\n\nA. The synthesis of GABA within the presynaptic terminal will be significantly and rapidly upregulated to compensate for the loss of recycled neurotransmitter.\n\nB. Postsynaptic GABA receptors will undergo rapid and complete desensitization, leading to a net decrease in inhibitory signaling compared to normal.\n\nC. GABA will diffuse out of the synaptic cleft more slowly, leading to prolonged activation of postsynaptic GABA receptors and a temporally extended inhibitory effect.\n\nD. The enzyme GABA transaminase (GABA-T) will be secreted into the synaptic cleft to degrade GABA extracellularly, compensating for the lack of transport.\n\nE. The concentration of GABA in the synaptic vesicles of the presynaptic neuron will decrease dramatically because the reuptake mechanism is essential for refilling them.", "solution": "We begin by stating the relevant physiological principles:\n- At GABAergic synapses, the primary termination of signaling is transporter-mediated reuptake of GABA from the synaptic cleft into presynaptic terminals and glia, largely via GAT-1. This is a rapid, high-affinity process.\n- GABA transaminase (GABA-T) is intracellular and degrades GABA after it has been transported into cells; it does not act extracellularly and is not secreted.\n- In the absence of reuptake, the only remaining clearance from the cleft is passive diffusion and dilution into the extracellular space, which is slower than transporter-mediated uptake.\n\nGiven the scenario in which GAT-1 is non-functional while all other components initially function normally:\n- The most immediate effect is that GABA released into the synaptic cleft cannot be rapidly cleared by reuptake. Therefore, GABA persists longer in the cleft and nearby extracellular space.\n- This prolonged presence leads to extended activation of postsynaptic GABA receptors (both synaptic and possibly extrasynaptic via spillover), lengthening the inhibitory postsynaptic current/potential time course.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A: Rapid upregulation of presynaptic GABA synthesis is not an immediate compensatory mechanism; changes in synthesis via enzyme expression (e.g., GAD) occur over longer timescales and are not the direct, immediate consequence.\n- B: While prolonged agonist exposure can cause some receptor desensitization, the immediate and direct effect of impaired clearance is prolonged receptor activation and increased inhibitory tone; “rapid and complete desensitization” with a net decrease compared to normal is not the most immediate outcome.\n- C: Without reuptake, GABA diffuses away more slowly relative to transporter-mediated clearance, causing prolonged receptor activation and a temporally extended inhibitory effect. This directly matches the immediate physiological consequence.\n- D: GABA-T is intracellular and is not secreted into the synaptic cleft; it cannot compensate extracellularly in this manner.\n- E: Vesicular GABA content relies on cytosolic GABA supplied by synthesis and, to some extent, recycled neurotransmitter. Loss of reuptake does not cause an immediate dramatic drop in vesicular GABA; any depletion would be gradual, not the most immediate direct effect.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and direct consequence is prolonged activation of postsynaptic GABA receptors due to slower extracellular clearance, as described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2346139"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of reuptake, we now delve into the biophysical engine that powers it.
