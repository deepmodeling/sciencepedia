In a subsequent experiment, the presynaptic neuron is stimulated electrically. It is determined that for each presynaptic action potential, an average of 4 vesicles are released into the synaptic cleft.

Through a series of intracellular recordings from a muscle fiber, she obtains the following data. The average amplitude of the postsynaptic response to a single presynaptic action potential, known as the End-Plate Potential (EPP), is measured to be $V_{EPP} = 45.6$ mV.

This can be determined by applying the quantal theory of neurotransmitter release, which treats synaptic transmission as a probabilistic process.\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean quantal content, denoted by $m$. The mean quantal content is the average number of neurotransmitter vesicles (quanta) released from the presynaptic terminal in response to a single action potential. According to the quantal hypothesis, the mean amplitude of the evoked End-Plate Potential ($V_{EPP}$) is the product of the mean quantal content ($m$) and the mean amplitude of the response to a single quantum, which is the miniature End-Plate Potential ($V_{mEPP}$).\nThe relationship is given by:\n$$V_{EPP} = m \\times V_{mEPP}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the mean quantal content, $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{V_{EPP}}{V_{mEPP}}$$\nWe are given $V_{EPP} = 45.6$ mV and $V_{mEPP} = 0.750$ mV.

The problem states that vesicle release can be modeled as a binomial process where there are $n$ independent trials (the active zones) and the probability of success for each trial (a vesicle being released) is $p$. The mean of a binomial distribution is given by the product of the number of trials and the probability of success. In this neurobiological context, this translates to:\n$$m = n \\times p$$\nWe are asked to find the average probability of release, $p$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{m}{n}$$\nWe have already calculated $m = 60.8$, and the problem gives the number of active zones as $n = 304$. Substituting these values:\n$$p = \\frac{60.8}{304}$$\n$$p = 0.2$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.
