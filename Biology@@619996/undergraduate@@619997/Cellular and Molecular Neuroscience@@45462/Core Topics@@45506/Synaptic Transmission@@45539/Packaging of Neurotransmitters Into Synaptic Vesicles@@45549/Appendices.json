They prepare a purified suspension of synaptic vesicles isolated from dopaminergic neurons. These vesicles contain two key integral membrane proteins: a Vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) and a vesicular dopamine transporter (VDAT). The V-ATPase hydrolyzes ATP to pump protons ($H^+$) into the vesicle, creating an electrochemical gradient (low internal pH and positive internal potential). The VDAT utilizes this proton gradient to actively transport dopamine from the cytosol into the vesicle.\n\nThe researchers set up three experimental conditions, incubating the vesicle suspension for a fixed period of time:\n- **Condition 1:** Vesicles in a buffer solution with radioactively labeled dopamine.\n- **Condition 2:** Vesicles in a buffer solution with ATP and radioactively labeled dopamine.\n- **Condition 3:** Vesicles in a buffer solution with ATP, radioactively labeled dopamine, and the neurotoxin Synapto-blocker.\n\nAfter incubation, they measure the intravesicular pH and the amount of radioactive dopamine accumulated inside the vesicles for each condition. The results are summarized below:\n\n| Condition   | Intravesicular pH | Accumulated Radioactive Dopamine |\n|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 1           | 7.2 (Neutral)     | Negligible                       |\n| 2           | 5.6 (Acidic)      | High                             |\n| 3           | 5.6 (Acidic)      | Negligible                       |\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most likely primary mechanism of action of Synapto-blocker?\n\nA.

It makes the vesicle membrane leaky, allowing dopamine to diffuse out as fast as it is transported in.", "solution": "The physical basis is that the V-ATPase hydrolyzes ATP to pump protons into the vesicle, generating a proton electrochemical gradient that has two components: a transmembrane pH gradient and an electrical potential. The electrochemical driving force for protons is\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{H}^+} = RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\text{H}^+]_{\\text{in}}}{[\\text{H}^+]_{\\text{out}}} \\right) + z F \\Delta\\Psi,\n$$\nwith $z=+1$ for $H^{+}$. The vesicular dopamine transporter (VDAT) is a secondary active transporter that uses $\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{H}^+}$ (primarily the $\\Delta\\text{pH}$ component) to drive concentrative dopamine uptake into the vesicle.\n\nInterpret the control conditions to establish expectations:\n- In condition 1 (no ATP), the V-ATPase cannot operate, so no $\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{H}^+}$ is generated; the vesicle interior stays near neutral, and VDAT lacks the driving force, yielding negligible uptake. This matches the observation of pH at 7.2 and negligible dopamine accumulation.\n- In condition 2 (with ATP), the V-ATPase generates an inward proton gradient (acidic lumen, positive inside), supplying the driving force for VDAT to accumulate dopamine. This matches the observed acidic pH (5.6) and high dopamine accumulation.\n\nNow diagnose condition 3 (ATP present plus Synapto-blocker): the intravesicular pH remains acidic (5.6), demonstrating that the V-ATPase is active and that the proton gradient is not dissipated. Yet dopamine accumulation is negligible.\n\nEvaluate each proposed mechanism against these constraints:\n- Option A (V-ATPase inhibition) would prevent acidification; the lumenal pH would remain near neutral, contrary to the observed pH 5.6. Therefore A is inconsistent.\n- Option B (ATP depletion by an ATPase) would secondarily inactivate the V-ATPase, again preventing acidification; this contradicts the observed acidic pH. Therefore B is inconsistent.\n- Option C (protonophore) would dissipate the proton gradient, driving $\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{H}^+} \\to 0$, which would collapse the $\\Delta\\text{pH}$ and move the lumenal pH toward the external value; this is incompatible with the measured acidic pH. Therefore C is inconsistent.\n- Option E (membrane leak allowing dopamine to diffuse out) would, if it were a general leak, also allow proton leakage, collapsing the proton gradient and eliminating the acidic pH, which contradicts the data. If it were a selective leak only for dopamine, it would have to allow substantial passive dopamine permeation across a lipid bilayer. However, at acidic intravesicular pH, dopamine is predominantly protonated and cationic, which has very low membrane permeability; selective passive diffusion is therefore mechanistically unlikely as a primary action. Moreover, the maintained robust proton gradient argues against a nonspecific “leaky membrane” mechanism. Thus E is not the most likely primary mechanism.\n- Option D (direct inhibition of VDAT) preserves V-ATPase function and the proton gradient (consistent with acidic pH) while eliminating transporter-mediated dopamine uptake (consistent with negligible accumulation). This precisely matches the pattern observed in condition 3.\n\nTherefore, the most likely primary mechanism of action of Synapto-blocker is direct inhibition of the vesicular dopamine transporter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2347707"}]}
