They are investigating how a specific experimental condition affects the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Using an intracellular microelectrode placed in a postsynaptic muscle cell, they perform two types of measurements.\n\nFirst, by stimulating the presynaptic motor nerve, they evoke a large depolarization in the muscle cell. This response is called the End-Plate Potential (EPP). The average amplitude of the EPPs recorded under their experimental setup is 27.6 mV.\n\nSecond, in the absence of any stimulation to the motor nerve, they record small, spontaneous fluctuations in the muscle cell's membrane potential. These are known as miniature End-Plate Potentials (mEPPs), which are understood to be the postsynaptic response to the release of a single quantum (one synaptic vesicle's worth) of acetylcholine. The mean amplitude of the observed mEPPs is 0.46 mV.\n\nAssuming the quantal hypothesis, which states that an EPP is the sum of many individual quantal events, calculate the quantal content for this synapse under these conditions. The quantal content is defined as the average number of vesicles released from the presynaptic terminal in response to a single nerve impulse.", "solution": "Under the quantal hypothesis, the mean End-Plate Potential (EPP) amplitude equals the product of the quantal content and the mean miniature EPP (mEPP) amplitude. Denoting the quantal content by $m$, the mean EPP amplitude by $\\langle A_{\\mathrm{EPP}}\\rangle$, and the mean mEPP amplitude (quantal size) by $q=\\langle A_{\\mathrm{mEPP}}\\rangle$, we have:\n$$\n\\langle A_{\\mathrm{EPP}}\\rangle = m\\,q \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m = \\frac{\\langle A_{\\mathrm{EPP}}\\rangle}{q}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, with units canceling:\n$$\nm = \\frac{27.6\\ \\mathrm{mV}}{0.46\\ \\mathrm{mV}} = \\frac{27.6}{0.46}.\n$$\nCompute the ratio explicitly:\n$$\n\\frac{27.6}{0.46} = \\frac{2760}{46} = 60.\n$$\nThus, the quantal content is $60$ vesicles per nerve impulse.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{60}$$", "id": "2353164"}, {"introduction": "After understanding the quantal nature of release, a key question arises: what triggers the fusion of these vesicles? This practice explores the critical role of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in synaptic transmission, using a classic experiment that removes extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ to separate spontaneous from evoked release. By analyzing this hypothetical scenario [@problem_id:2353156], you will develop a nuanced understanding of the distinct molecular mechanisms governing these two fundamental modes of synaptic communication.", "problem": "An electrophysiologist is investigating the mechanisms of neurotransmitter release at the frog neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a model synapse. In the first phase of the experiment, the NMJ is bathed in a standard Ringer's solution containing a physiological concentration of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). When the presynaptic motor neuron is electrically stimulated, a large depolarizing potential, known as the end-plate potential (EPP), is recorded in the postsynaptic muscle fiber. In the absence of stimulation, small, spontaneous depolarizations of a consistent amplitude, called miniature end-plate potentials (mEPPs), are also observed.\n\nIn the second phase of the experiment, the standard Ringer's solution is replaced with a solution that is nominally free of $Ca^{2+}$ and contains EGTA, a chemical that chelates (binds to) any residual free $Ca^{2+}$ ions. After this change, electrical stimulation of the motor neuron no longer produces any EPPs. However, the spontaneous mEPPs continue to occur, albeit at a potentially altered frequency.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate biophysical explanation for the persistence of mEPPs in a calcium-free extracellular medium?\n\nA. In the absence of extracellular calcium, the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors become hypersensitive and begin to open stochastically, generating potentials that are indistinguishable from mEPPs.\n\nB. The presynaptic terminal contains large internal stores of calcium within the endoplasmic reticulum, which are automatically released to trigger single vesicle fusion events when extracellular calcium is absent.\n\nC. The spontaneous fusion of a single synaptic vesicle with the presynaptic membrane is a low-probability, stochastic event that can occur with basal intracellular calcium concentrations and does not depend on the large, rapid influx of extracellular calcium that is required for evoked, multi-vesicular release.\n\nD. In a calcium-free solution, the presynaptic action potential is still generated but is only strong enough to trigger the release of a single vesicle, resulting in an mEPP instead of a full EPP.\n\nE. The machinery for vesicle fusion can use magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$) as a substitute for calcium ions. In a calcium-free environment, the physiological concentration of magnesium is sufficient to sustain the low rate of spontaneous release responsible for mEPPs.", "solution": "We apply the quantal hypothesis and calcium-triggered exocytosis. In physiological extracellular calcium, a presynaptic action potential opens voltage-gated calcium channels, causing a rapid local increase of intracellular calcium concentration $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ near release sites. Vesicle fusion is triggered by calcium binding to the fusion sensor (e.g., synaptotagmin), producing multivesicular release and a large end-plate potential. In the quantal model, the mean EPP amplitude satisfies\n$$\nA = n\\,p\\,q,\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of functional release sites, $p$ is the probability of release per site per action potential, and $q$ is the quantal size (the amplitude of a miniature end-plate potential, mEPP). The steep calcium dependence of evoked release can be expressed as\n$$\np \\propto [Ca^{2+}]_{i}^{m},\n$$\nwith $m>1$ (classically $m\\approx 3\\text{ to }4$), reflecting cooperative calcium binding.\n\nWhen extracellular calcium is removed and residual $Ca^{2+}$ is chelated by EGTA, an invading action potential may still open presynaptic calcium channels, but there is no significant calcium influx because $[Ca^{2+}]_{o}\\approx 0$, so the rapid local rise in $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ does not occur. Consequently $p$ for evoked release becomes effectively zero, and thus\n$$\nA = n\\,p\\,q \\to 0,\n$$\neliminating evoked EPPs.\n\nHowever, spontaneous mEPPs persist because single-vesicle fusion is a low-probability, stochastic process that can occur at basal $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ without requiring the large, rapid calcium microdomain created by an action potential. A minimal kinetic description of spontaneous fusion rate $\\lambda_{\\text{spon}}$ is that it is thermally activated with a calcium-dependent energy barrier $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{spon}} \\sim \\lambda_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}([Ca^{2+}]_{i})}{k_{B}T}\\right),\n$$\nso that even at resting $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ the rate is finite, yielding occasional single-vesicle release events whose postsynaptic effect is the mEPP. Removal of extracellular calcium reduces evoked $p$ to near zero and often lowers $\\lambda_{\\text{spon}}$, but does not eliminate it, so mEPPs remain observable.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\nA is incorrect because nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated and require acetylcholine binding; they do not open stochastically in the absence of ligand to produce quantal mEPPs. mEPPs are abolished by postsynaptic antagonists, showing they arise from quantal acetylcholine release, not spontaneous receptor openings.\n\nB is incorrect because internal calcium stores are not “automatically released” when extracellular calcium is removed, nor are they required to generate the low-rate, single-vesicle spontaneous fusion events observed as mEPPs.\n\nC is correct: spontaneous single-vesicle fusion is a low-probability, stochastic process that can occur at basal $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ and does not require the large, rapid influx of extracellular calcium that drives evoked, multivesicular release.\n\nD is incorrect because, in the absence of extracellular calcium, an action potential does not produce the necessary calcium influx; therefore it does not reliably trigger even single-vesicle evoked release.\n\nE is incorrect because the exocytotic calcium sensor is highly selective for $Ca^{2+}$; physiological $Mg^{2+}$ does not substitute to sustain calcium-sensor–mediated fusion. Indeed, $Mg^{2+}$ generally does not trigger synaptotagmin-dependent release and can screen charges, reducing release probability.\n\nTherefore, the persistence of mEPPs in zero extracellular calcium is best explained by spontaneous, calcium-independent or weakly calcium-dependent single-vesicle fusion occurring at basal intracellular calcium levels, as stated in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2353156"}, {"introduction": "A synapse is a dynamic system that must function reliably under varying levels of activity. This final practice examines the sustainability of synaptic transmission during high-frequency stimulation, focusing on the crucial process of neurotransmitter recycling [@problem_id:2353162]. This thought experiment challenges you to connect the molecular process of choline re-uptake to the functional outcome of synaptic fatigue, providing insight into how synapses maintain fidelity during intense use.", "problem": "The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the chemical synapse formed between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber, responsible for initiating muscle contraction. The process involves the release of the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic terminal. Once in the synaptic cleft, ACh binds to receptors on the muscle fiber, causing a depolarization known as the End-Plate Potential (EPP). To terminate the signal, an enzyme called Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) rapidly hydrolyzes ACh into choline and acetate.\n\nFor neurotransmission to be sustained, the presynaptic terminal must replenish its supply of ACh. A crucial step in this process is the re-uptake of choline from the synaptic cleft into the motor neuron via a specific protein called the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT). This recycled choline serves as the primary substrate for the synthesis of new ACh molecules.\n\nConsider an experiment where an isolated nerve-muscle preparation is bathed in a solution containing a new drug, \"Cholinex,\" which acts as a potent and specific inhibitor of the CHT. After allowing the drug to take full effect, the presynaptic motor neuron is subjected to a sustained, high-frequency train of action potentials (50 Hz for 10 seconds).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected effect on the EPPs recorded from the muscle fiber during this period of high-frequency stimulation?\n\nA. The amplitude of successive EPPs will rapidly decline, eventually leading to transmission failure.\n\nB. The EPPs will maintain a constant, large amplitude, causing a sustained maximal contraction.\n\nC. The amplitude of successive EPPs will progressively increase (facilitate) throughout the entire stimulation period.\n\nD. No EPPs will be generated from the very first stimulus, as all ACh synthesis is immediately halted.\n\nE. The duration of each EPP will be greatly prolonged, while the amplitude remains unchanged.", "solution": "At the neuromuscular junction, each end-plate potential amplitude depends on the amount of acetylcholine released and the postsynaptic response. A standard quantal description expresses this as $EPP \\propto m q$, where $m$ is the quantal content (number of vesicles released) and $q$ is the quantal size (postsynaptic response per vesicle, which depends on the amount of acetylcholine per vesicle and receptor sensitivity).\n\nAcetylcholine in the presynaptic terminal is synthesized from choline and acetyl-CoA by choline acetyltransferase, with choline supplied primarily by re-uptake through the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT). Inhibition of CHT by Cholinex prevents efficient recycling of choline, thereby limiting ongoing acetylcholine synthesis. Acetylcholinesterase remains active in the synaptic cleft and rapidly hydrolyzes acetylcholine, so termination of each EPP is unchanged in kinetics.\n\nDuring sustained high-frequency stimulation, the demand for vesicle release sharply increases. Initially, preloaded synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine are available, so EPPs will be generated. However, two presynaptic limiting processes ensue:\n- Depletion of the readily releasable pool reduces $m$ over time due to vesicle use-dependent depletion (short-term synaptic depression under high-frequency stimulation).\n- Inhibition of CHT limits resynthesis and refilling of acetylcholine into recycled vesicles, so newly recycled vesicles become underfilled, which reduces $q$.\n\nBecause both $m$ and, progressively, $q$ decline in the presence of continued high-frequency stimulation without adequate choline supply, the amplitude of successive EPPs will progressively decline. Given the intensity and duration of stimulation, this decline will be sufficient to produce transmission failure once the available acetylcholine and fully filled vesicles are exhausted.\n\nThis excludes alternative choices: a constant large amplitude sustained response is impossible due to depletion (contradicting B); a progressive increase throughout the entire train is not sustained under depletion and synthesis block (contradicting C), although brief initial facilitation may occur before depression dominates; immediate absence of EPPs is incorrect because preexisting acetylcholine and filled vesicles support initial transmission (contradicting D); and EPP duration will not be prolonged because acetylcholinesterase remains active and termination kinetics are unchanged (contradicting E).\n\nTherefore, the expected effect is a rapid decline in EPP amplitude leading to failure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2353162"}]}
