In the initial control experiment, a single action potential is induced in the presynaptic neuron, and the resulting depolarization in the postsynaptic neuron, known as an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP), is recorded. The experiment is then repeated under a new condition where the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in the extracellular solution bathing the synapse is reduced to 10% of its original physiological value. All other parameters, including the properties of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons and the resting membrane potentials, are held constant.\n\nAssuming all other factors remain ideal, which of the following outcomes is the most direct and significant consequence of reducing the extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration on the postsynaptic response to a single presynaptic action potential?\n\nA. The amplitude of the presynaptic action potential will decrease.\n\nB. The EPSP will be converted into an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP).\n\nC. The amount of neurotransmitter released per action potential will increase, leading to a larger EPSP.\n\nD. The amplitude of the EPSP will significantly decrease.\n\nE. The duration of the EPSP will increase, but its amplitude will remain unchanged.", "solution": "The postsynaptic EPSP amplitude produced by a single presynaptic action potential can be expressed as proportional to the quantal content times the quantal size, with the latter determined by postsynaptic receptor properties:\n$$\nA_{\\text{EPSP}} \\propto m q, \\quad m = N p,\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of readily releasable vesicles and $p$ is the release probability. Holding postsynaptic properties constant leaves $q$ unchanged, so changes in $A_{\\text{EPSP}}$ arise from $m$, specifically from $p$.\n\nThe release probability $p$ depends steeply and cooperatively on the presynaptic intracellular calcium concentration near release sites during the action potential, commonly modeled as\n$$\np \\propto [\\text{Ca}]_{i}^{n},\n$$\nwith $n$ typically in the range $3$ to $4$. The action potential waveform in the presynaptic neuron is primarily determined by voltage-gated $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\\text{K}^{+}$ channels, so its amplitude is not directly reduced by changing extracellular $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration under the stated conditions.\n\nPresynaptic calcium entry during the action potential is governed by the calcium current\n$$\nI_{\\text{Ca}}(t) = g_{\\text{Ca}}(t)\\,\\big(V_{m}(t) - E_{\\text{Ca}}\\big),\n$$\nwith the Nernst potential for calcium\n$$\nE_{\\text{Ca}} = \\frac{RT}{2F} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Ca}]_{o}}{[\\text{Ca}]_{i}}\\right).\n$$\nReducing $[\\text{Ca}]_{o}$ decreases $E_{\\text{Ca}}$ and thus reduces the driving force $\\big(V_{m} - E_{\\text{Ca}}\\big)$ for inward calcium current at the same membrane potential $V_{m}$, thereby reducing the time-integrated calcium influx and the peak $[\\text{Ca}]_{i}$ transient that triggers vesicle fusion.
