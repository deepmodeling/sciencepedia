The axon terminal of Neuron A is known to possess inhibitory presynaptic autoreceptors, which are sensitive to the same excitatory neurotransmitter that Neuron A releases. In an experiment, Neuron A is artificially stimulated to fire at a constant rate, causing Neuron B to fire action potentials at a stable baseline frequency. A new pharmacological agent is then introduced into the synaptic cleft. This agent is a potent agonist for the inhibitory presynaptic autoreceptors on Neuron A, but it does not interact with the postsynaptic receptors on Neuron B.\n\nAssuming the artificial stimulation of Neuron A remains constant, what is the most likely immediate effect of applying this agonist on the firing rate of Neuron B?\n\nA. The firing rate will increase significantly.\n\nB. The firing rate will decrease significantly.\n\nC. The firing rate will remain unchanged.\n\nD.

Let the probability of vesicle release per action potential be $P_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, and let the quantal content be $q$. The mean presynaptic release rate of neurotransmitter quanta is then proportional to\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\propto f_{A} P_{\\mathrm{rel}} q.\n$$\nInhibitory presynaptic autoreceptors on Neuron A, when activated by their agonist, reduce transmitter release by decreasing $P_{\\mathrm{rel}}$. Mechanistically, such autoreceptors are typically coupled to intracellular pathways (often via $G_{i/o}$ proteins) that reduce presynaptic $Ca^{2+}$ influx, thereby lowering vesicle fusion probability. Represent this effect as\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\to \\alpha P_{\\mathrm{rel}}, \\quad 0<\\alpha<1,\n$$\nwith $f_{A}$ unchanged by assumption. Hence,\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\to \\alpha R_{\\mathrm{rel}},\n$$\nso the neurotransmitter concentration in the cleft, and thus the postsynaptic excitatory drive, decreases proportionally.\n\nLet the postsynaptic excitatory postsynaptic current be $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}$, which for a fixed postsynaptic receptor sensitivity $g_{\\mathrm{post}}$ scales with presynaptic release,\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{EPSC}} \\propto R_{\\mathrm{rel}} g_{\\mathrm{post}}.\n$$\nSince the pharmacological agent does not interact with postsynaptic receptors, $g_{\\mathrm{post}}$ remains unchanged, so $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}$ decreases as $R_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ decreases.\n\nLet the postsynaptic firing rate be $f_{B}=\\Phi(I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}})$, where $\\Phi$ is a monotonically increasing function of excitatory synaptic input over the relevant operating range. Then a decrease in $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}$ yields\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{EPSC}} \\downarrow \\;\\Rightarrow\\; f_{B} \\downarrow.\n$$\nBecause $f_{A}$ is held constant and the agonist continues to activate the inhibitory autoreceptors, the decreased $P_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ and reduced excitatory drive persist under these conditions; there is no basis, in the information given, for a spontaneous return to baseline (which would require desensitization or a compensatory mechanism not described). The identity of the excitatory neurotransmitter is irrelevant to the direction of this effect, provided it is the ligand for the inhibitory presynaptic autoreceptors, as stated.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immediate effect of applying the agonist is a significant decrease in the firing rate of Neuron B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2351141"}, {"introduction": "The impact of a synapse is often thought of as either excitatory (depolarizing) or inhibitory (hyperpolarizing), but this is an oversimplification. This problem delves into a more subtle and powerful form of inhibition known as shunting. You will explore a scenario where opening an ion channel causes no direct change in membrane potential ($V_m$) yet significantly alters the neuron's responsiveness to other inputs, highlighting a key principle of synaptic integration [@problem_id:2351132].", "problem": "In a typical neuron, the resting membrane potential, $V_{rest}$, is maintained at a steady state. Consider a specific postsynapse where a neurotransmitter is released, which binds to and opens a type of ionotropic receptor.

A significant change in membrane potential occurs, but the direction (depolarization or hyperpolarization) cannot be determined without the exact value of $V_{rest}$.\n\nE. No immediate change in membrane potential occurs, but the neuron becomes more susceptible to depolarization by subsequent excitatory inputs.", "solution": "Let the membrane potential be $V_{m}$, the resting membrane potential be $V_{rest}$, and the chloride Nernst potential be $E_{Cl}$. The problem states $E_{Cl} = V_{rest}$ and that opening of the ionotropic receptor increases the chloride conductance $g_{Cl}$.\n\nThe ionic current through a conductance with reversal potential $E_{ion}$ is given by\n$$\nI_{ion} = g_{ion}\\left(V_{m} - E_{ion}\\right).\n$$\nFor chloride,\n$$\nI_{Cl} = g_{Cl}\\left(V_{m} - E_{Cl}\\right).\n$$\nAt the moment the channels open, the membrane is at rest, so $V_{m} = V_{rest} = E_{Cl}$.

Additionally, the membrane time constant\n$$\n\\tau_{m} = R_{m}C_{m}\n$$\ndecreases, reducing temporal summation. Together these constitute shunting inhibition: no immediate change in $V_{m}$ when $E_{Cl}=V_{rest}$, but decreased excitability to depolarizing inputs.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that there is no immediate change in membrane potential, but the neuron becomes more resistant to depolarization by other inputs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2351132"}, {"introduction": "Synapses are not static; their strength changes dynamically based on recent patterns of activity, a property called short-term plasticity. This advanced exercise challenges you to move from a qualitative description to a quantitative model of synaptic depression, a fundamental form of this plasticity.

Consider a simplified phenomenological model of a depressing synapse, where short-term depression is solely due to the depletion of a finite readily releasable pool (RRP) of neurotransmitter vesicles.\n\nA presynaptic neuron fires a long train of action potentials with a constant inter-spike interval of $\\Delta t$, evoking a series of Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs) in a postsynaptic cell. The dynamics of the synapse are described as follows:\n\n1.  The normalized amplitude of the $n$-th EPSP in the train, $A_n$, is directly proportional to the amount of neurotransmitter released. This amount is given by the product of the fraction of available resources in the RRP just before the $n$-th spike, $R_n$, and a constant release probability, $U$. We can thus write $A_n \\propto R_n U$.\n2.  The synapse starts with a full RRP, so for the first spike ($n=1$), the fraction of available resources is $R_1=1$.\n3.  Immediately after the $n$-th spike, a fraction $U$ of the available resources $R_n$ is consumed.\n4.  Between spikes, the RRP is replenished from a larger reserve pool. The fraction of available resources $R$ recovers exponentially towards 1 with a time constant $\\tau_D$.\n\nBased on this model, derive an analytical expression for the pulse number, $N$, at which the EPSP amplitude, $A_N$, first drops to exactly one-third of its initial value, $A_1$. Your answer for $N$ may be a non-integer, representing an interpolated value. Express your answer as a single closed-form expression in terms of $U$, $\\Delta t$, and $\\tau_D$.", "solution": "The EPSP amplitude is proportional to released resources, so $A_{n} \\propto U R_{n}$.
