A fundamental task in neuroscience is to quantify the strength of a synapse by determining, on average, how many of these packets, or quanta, are released by a single presynaptic action potential. This first exercise guides you through calculating the quantal content, $m$, using the most direct experimental measurements of postsynaptic potentials.

The goal is to determine the fundamental characteristics of synaptic transmission at this connection. The experiment involves two types of measurements made on the postsynaptic neuron.\n\nFirst, the researcher repeatedly stimulates the presynaptic axon to fire an action potential and measures the resulting depolarization in the postsynaptic cell. After averaging many trials, the mean evoked postsynaptic potential is found to be 8.0 mV.\n\nSecond, in the absence of any stimulation, the researcher records small, spontaneous depolarizations. These are understood to be the postsynaptic response to the spontaneous release of a single packet, or \"quantum,\" of neurotransmitter from a single synaptic vesicle. The average amplitude of these spontaneous events, known as the mean miniature postsynaptic potential, is determined to be 0.50 mV.\n\nBased on the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmission, which posits that the total evoked response is an integer multiple of the response to a single quantum, calculate the average number of synaptic vesicles released by a single presynaptic action potential at this synapse.", "solution": "Let the mean evoked postsynaptic potential amplitude be denoted by $\\langle V_{\\text{evoked}} \\rangle$, the mean miniature postsynaptic potential amplitude (the quantal size) by $q$, and the average number of quanta (vesicles) released per presynaptic action potential by $\\langle n \\rangle$.\n\nBy the quantal hypothesis of synaptic transmission, the mean evoked response equals the product of the average number of released quanta and the quantal size:\n$$\n\\langle V_{\\text{evoked}} \\rangle = \\langle n \\rangle \\, q.\n$$\nSolving for the average number of quanta gives\n$$\n\\langle n \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle V_{\\text{evoked}} \\rangle}{q}.\n$$\nUsing the given values (both measured in the same units so that the ratio is dimensionless), we obtain\n$$\n\\langle n \\rangle = \\frac{8.0}{0.50} = 16.\n$$\nTherefore, on average, a single presynaptic action potential releases 16 vesicles at this synapse.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "2349647"}, {"introduction": "Neurotransmitter release is a probabilistic event, meaning an incoming action potential does not guarantee a postsynaptic response. This practice demonstrates how these \"failures\" of transmission are not empty data points but can be used to deduce crucial synaptic properties. By modeling vesicle release with Poisson statistics, a powerful tool for describing rare and independent events, you will learn to calculate the quantal content, $m$, from the observed frequency of release failures.

The researcher repeatedly stimulates the presynaptic neuron with an electrical pulse, which is sufficient to trigger an action potential, while recording the electrical response in the postsynaptic neuron. The release of neurotransmitter vesicles from the presynaptic terminal is known to be a probabilistic process. In this experiment, the number of vesicles released per stimulus is assumed to be well-described by a Poisson distribution. The average number of vesicles released per stimulus is defined as the quantal content ($m$) of the synapse.\n\nOver the course of 250 experimental trials, the researcher observes that in 38 of these trials, the presynaptic stimulus fails to elicit any postsynaptic response, indicating a failure of neurotransmitter release.\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the quantal content ($m$) for this synapse. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem states that the number of neurotransmitter vesicles (quanta) released per stimulus, let's call this number $k$, follows a Poisson distribution. The probability of releasing exactly $k$ quanta, given a mean (quantal content) of $m$, is given by the Poisson probability mass function:\n$$P(k; m) = \\frac{e^{-m} m^{k}}{k!}$$\nA \"failure of neurotransmitter release\" corresponds to the event where zero vesicles are released, i.e., $k=0$. We can find the theoretical probability of a failure, $P(0)$, by substituting $k=0$ into the Poisson formula:\n$$P(0) = \\frac{e^{-m} m^{0}}{0!}$$\nBy definition, any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1 (so $m^{0} = 1$), and the factorial of 0 is also 1 (so $0! = 1$). This simplifies the expression for the probability of a failure to:\n$$P(0) = e^{-m}$$\nThe experimental data allows us to estimate this probability. We are given the total number of trials, $N_{\\text{total}} = 250$, and the number of observed failures, $N_{\\text{failures}} = 38$. The experimentally observed frequency of failures is our best estimate for the true probability of failure:\n$$P(0) \\approx \\frac{N_{\\text{failures}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{38}{250}$$\nCalculating this value gives:\n$$P(0) \\approx 0.152$$\nNow, we can equate the theoretical probability of failure with our experimental estimate to solve for the quantal content $m$:\n$$e^{-m} = 0.152$$\nTo solve for $m$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\ln(e^{-m}) = \\ln(0.152)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\ln(e^{x}) = x$, the left side simplifies to $-m$:\n$$-m = \\ln(0.152)$$\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives the expression for $m$:\n$$m = -\\ln(0.152)$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$m \\approx -(-1.88391...)$$\n$$m \\approx 1.88391...$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are 1, 8, and 8.
