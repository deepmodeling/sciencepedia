For practical calculations in a biological context, students and researchers often pre-calculate the value of the term $\\frac{RT}{zF}$ for a specific temperature and ionic valence.\n\nA neurobiology student is developing a computational model of a generic mammalian neuron.

Since the membrane is permeable only to $K^{+}$, the efflux of these positive ions leaves behind a net negative charge inside the cell (uncompensated anions) and builds up a net positive charge on the immediate outer surface of the membrane. This separation of charge generates an electrical potential difference across the membrane, making the inside negative relative to the outside. This inside-negative electrical potential creates an electrical force that opposes the further efflux of positively charged $K^{+}$ ions. Equilibrium is reached when this inward electrical force exactly balances the outward chemical driving force. Therefore, the equilibrium potential $E_{K}$ must be negative.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically.
