We are given the stoichiometry of the pump and the total number of ATP molecules, $N$, consumed.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the charge movement in a single cycle of the pump's operation.

The total positive charge imported in the form of potassium ions is:\n$$Q_{in, K^+} = 2 \\times (+1e) = +2e$$\n\nThe net charge transported out of the cell in a single cycle, $q_{net, cycle}$, is the difference between the total charge that exits and the total charge that enters.\n$$q_{net, cycle} = Q_{out, Na^+} - Q_{in, K^+}$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$q_{net, cycle} = (+3e) - (+2e) = +e$$\nThis positive result confirms that there is a net export of positive charge from the cell with each cycle, which is why the pump is described as electrogenic.\n\nThe problem states that one cycle of the pump is fueled by the hydrolysis of one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). Therefore, the consumption of one ATP molecule corresponds to a net export of charge equal to $+e$.\n\nThe entire population of neurons consumes a total of $N$ molecules of ATP. Since all this ATP is used to power the $Na^+/K^+$-ATPase pumps and each ATP molecule drives one cycle, a total of $N$ cycles occur across the population.\n\nThe total net charge, $Q_{net}$, transported out of the neuron population is the net charge per cycle multiplied by the total number of cycles.\n$$Q_{net} = q_{net, cycle} \\times (\\text{number of cycles})$$\n$$Q_{net} = (+e) \\times N$$\n$$Q_{net} = Ne$$\n\nThus, the total net charge exported from the neurons is given by the expression $Ne$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{Ne}$$", "id": "2341818"}, {"introduction": "In a healthy neuron, the pump's activity is precisely balanced by the passive leak of ions across the membrane, creating a dynamic steady state.
