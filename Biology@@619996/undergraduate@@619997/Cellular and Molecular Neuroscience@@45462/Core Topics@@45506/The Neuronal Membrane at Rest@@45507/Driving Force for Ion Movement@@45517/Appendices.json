By comparing the forces on sodium and potassium ions at rest, you will gain a fundamental insight into why a neuron is always poised for rapid electrical signaling.", "problem": "In a typical mammalian neuron, the resting membrane potential ($V_{m}$) is actively maintained at approximately -70 mV. The equilibrium potential for sodium ions ($E_{Na}$) is approximately +60 mV, and the equilibrium potential for potassium ions ($E_{K}$) is approximately -90 mV. The electrochemical driving force on an ion is the difference between the membrane potential and the ion's equilibrium potential, which determines the magnitude of the net flux of that ion across the membrane if channels permeable to it were to open.\n\nBased on these values, which of the following statements correctly identifies the ion ($Na^+$ or $K^+$) that experiences a greater magnitude of electrochemical driving force at rest and provides the correct justification?\n\nA. $Na^+$, because its equilibrium potential is numerically farther from the resting membrane potential.\n\nB. $K^+$, because its equilibrium potential is numerically farther from the resting membrane potential.\n\nC.

The sign of the driving force determines whether an ion will flow into or out of the cell, which in turn dictates whether the membrane potential will become more positive (depolarize) or more negative (hyperpolarize). This thought experiment [@problem_id:2334776] challenges your conceptual understanding by using a hypothetical anion, forcing you to reason from first principles about how charge and potential differences interact to govern ion flux.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating a newly discovered, ligand-gated ion channel in a model neuron. This channel is found to be exclusively permeable to a specific hypothetical monovalent anion, which we will call Anion X ($X^{-}$). Through a series of voltage-clamp experiments, the equilibrium potential for $X^{-}$ ($E_X$) is determined to be $-85 \\text{ mV}$. The neuron's resting membrane potential ($V_m$) is stable at $-60 \\text{ mV}$. A neurotransmitter is then applied to the neuron, causing a large number of these specific ion channels to open.\n\nAssuming the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of all ions remain constant during the initial moments after channel opening, which of the following statements correctly describes the immediate net movement of Anion X?\n\nA. The net movement of $X^{-}$ will be out of the cell (efflux).\n\nB. The net movement of $X^{-}$ will be into the cell (influx).\n\nC. There will be no net movement of $X^{-}$ across the membrane.\n\nD. The direction of movement cannot be determined without knowing the specific intracellular and extracellular concentrations of $X^{-}$.", "solution": "Let $X^{-}$ be a monovalent anion with valence $z=-1$. Its Nernst equilibrium potential is defined by the Nernst equation,\n$$\nE_{X}=\\frac{RT}{zF}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[X^{-}]_{o}}{[X^{-}]_{i}}\\right),\n$$\nwhich remains fixed in the initial moments after channel opening because intracellular and extracellular concentrations are assumed constant. By definition, when the membrane potential equals $E_{X}$, there is no net flux of $X^{-}$.\n\nFor an ohmic channel selective to $X^{-}$ with conductance $g_{X}>0$, the macroscopic current (defined as the flow of positive charge, outward positive by convention) is\n$$\nI_{X}=g_{X}\\left(V_{m}-E_{X}\\right).\n$$\nGiven $V_{m}=-60 \\text{ mV}$ and $E_{X}=-85 \\text{ mV}$, we have\n$$\nV_{m}-E_{X}=\\left(-60 \\text{ mV}\\right)-\\left(-85 \\text{ mV}\\right)=25 \\text{ mV}>0,\n$$\nso $I_{X}>0$, i.e., an outward positive current. Because $X^{-}$ carries negative charge and the channel is exclusively permeable to $X^{-}$, an outward positive current corresponds to an inward flux of negative charge. Therefore, the immediate net movement of $X^{-}$ is into the cell (influx).\n\nEquivalently, opening the channels drives $V_{m}$ toward $E_{X}$; since $E_{X}$ is more negative than $V_{m}$, this requires a hyperpolarizing movement, achieved by $X^{-}$ influx. Knowledge of the absolute concentrations is unnecessary because $E_{X}$ already encapsulates their ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2334776"}, {"introduction": "A crucial distinction in neurophysiology is the difference between the driving force and the actual ion current. A very large driving force may exist, but if there are no open channels for the ion to pass through, no current will flow. This exercise [@problem_id:2334817] presents a classic scenario using the channel blocker Tetrodotoxin (TTX) to test this concept. By analyzing this situation, you will solidify your understanding that ion current is the product of both driving force and membrane conductance, and that blocking one does not necessarily eliminate the other.", "problem": "A typical mammalian neuron is at rest in a physiological solution maintained at a temperature of $37^\\circ\\text{C}$.

The driving force for $Na^+$ decreases significantly because TTX causes the membrane to hyperpolarize.\n\nB. The driving force for $Na^+$ increases significantly because the equilibrium potential for $Na^+$ becomes more positive.\n\nC. The driving force for $Na^+$ becomes zero because TTX prevents any flow of $Na^+$ ions.\n\nD. The driving force for $Na^+$ remains essentially unchanged.\n\nE. The driving force for $Na^+$ reverses its direction.", "solution": "The electrochemical driving force for an ion is defined as the difference between the membrane potential and the Nernst (equilibrium) potential for that ion. For sodium, the Nernst potential is given by the Nernst equation:\n$$\nE_{\\text{Na}}=\\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[Na^{+}]_{\\text{out}}}{[Na^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}\\right).\n$$\nHere, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. Because $E_{\\text{Na}}$ depends only on $R$, $T$, $F$, and the ratio $[Na^{+}]_{\\text{out}}/[Na^{+}]_{\\text{in}}$, any intervention that does not change temperature or ion concentrations leaves $E_{\\text{Na}}$ unchanged.\n\nThe driving force for $Na^{+}$ is\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{drive,Na}}=V_{m}-E_{\\text{Na}}.\n$$\nImmediately after application of Tetrodotoxin (TTX), which specifically blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, neither $[Na^{+}]_{\\text{out}}$ nor $[Na^{+}]_{\\text{in}}$ changes, and thus $E_{\\text{Na}}$ is unchanged. Moreover, at the resting potential $V_{m}$, voltage-gated sodium channels are largely closed even in the absence of TTX, and the resting membrane potential is dominated by potassium leak conductance. Therefore, immediately after TTX exposure, $V_{m}$ remains essentially at its resting value. TTX reduces sodium conductance but does not, by itself and immediately, alter $E_{\\text{Na}}$ or significantly shift $V_{m}$.\n\nConsequently, the quantity $V_{m}-E_{\\text{Na}}$ remains essentially unchanged. This rules out the alternatives that require a change in $V_{m}$ (hyperpolarization), a change in $E_{\\text{Na}}$, a zero driving force (which would require $V_{m}=E_{\\text{Na}}$, not merely channel block), or a reversal in direction (which would require a sign change in $V_{m}-E_{\\text{Na}}$).
