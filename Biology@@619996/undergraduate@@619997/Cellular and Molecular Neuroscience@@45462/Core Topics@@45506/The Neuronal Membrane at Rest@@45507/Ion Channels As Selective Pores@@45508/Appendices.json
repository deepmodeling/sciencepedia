This thought experiment examines how a single amino acid mutation—in this case, introducing a negative charge into the pore—can dramatically alter this environment, illustrating the \"field strength\" theory of ion selectivity and explaining how a potassium channel might be re-engineered to prefer divalent cations like $Ca^{2+}$. [@problem_id:2339518]", "problem": "A neurobiologist is studying a hypothetical voltage-gated cation channel, named \"CatV1\", which is normally highly selective for potassium ions (K$^{+}$). The selectivity of this channel is determined by a narrow region of the pore known as the selectivity filter. In the wild-type (normal) version of the CatV1 channel, a specific position within the lining of this filter is occupied by a glycine residue. Glycine is the simplest amino acid, with a single hydrogen atom as its side chain, making it small and electrically neutral.\n\nA researcher creates a mutant version of the CatV1 channel by altering its genetic code.

The channel's voltage-sensing and gating mechanism will be fundamentally altered, causing it to open at much lower membrane potentials.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the physical determinants of ion selectivity in cation channels. In wild-type K^{+} channels, the selectivity filter coordinates a dehydrated K^{+} using backbone carbonyl oxygens arranged to mimic K^{+}’s hydration shell. The glycine residue at a critical position contributes a small, neutral side chain that does not introduce additional fixed charge; thus the local electrostatic field in the filter is set mainly by backbone dipoles and is considered a relatively low-to-intermediate field-strength environment. In such environments, selectivity favors larger monovalent cations like K^{+} over smaller monovalent cations like Na^{+} due to optimal coordination geometry and dehydration-compensation balance.\n\nIntroduce the mutation: replacing glycine with aspartate introduces a side chain bearing a carboxylate that is deprotonated at physiological pH, carrying a net charge approximately $-e$. This adds a localized negative charge within the selectivity filter. The first-order electrostatic interaction energy between an ion of valence $z$ and a fixed site charge $-e$ at separation $r$ in a medium of dielectric constant $\\epsilon$ is\n$$\nU \\approx \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon}\\frac{(z e)(-e)}{r} \\propto -z.\n$$\nThus, purely electrostatically, increasing $z$ from $1$ to $2$ doubles the stabilizing interaction magnitude, favoring divalent cations such as Ca^{2+} over monovalent cations.\n\nIon permeation selectivity can be framed by the free-energy balance for transferring an ion from water into the filter site:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(z) = \\Delta G_{\\text{dehyd}}(z) + \\Delta G_{\\text{site}}(z),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\text{dehyd}}(z)$ is the dehydration penalty and $\\Delta G_{\\text{site}}(z)$ is the stabilization in the filter. In the Born approximation for hydration,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{hydr}} \\sim -\\frac{z^{2} e^{2}}{8\\pi \\epsilon_{0}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{w}}\\right)\\frac{1}{r_{i}},\n$$\nso dehydration penalties scale approximately with $z^{2}$ and inverse ionic radius $1/r_{i}$. To compensate such penalties, high-field-strength binding sites with negatively charged ligands (e.g., carboxylates) are required; these provide strong electrostatic stabilization that increases with $z$ and favors ions of higher charge density. This is the classical field-strength (Eisenman) perspective: carboxylate-rich sites are high-field-strength and preferentially bind smaller and/or higher-valence cations, notably Ca^{2+}.\n\nBy introducing a carboxylate into a filter that was previously neutral at that position, the local field strength increases. Consequently:\n- The filter’s electrostatic attraction to cations increases and scales with $z$, making divalent cations energetically more favorable relative to monovalent cations.\n- The added negative charge will not favor anions; rather, it will electrostatically repel them, so losing cation selectivity in favor of anions is unlikely.\n- The mutation occurs in the selectivity filter, not the canonical voltage-sensing domains; therefore, voltage-dependent gating thresholds are not the primary locus of effect.\n\nComparing options:\n- A is unlikely as a general prediction; while some filter mutations can abolish conduction, the most direct and robustly inferred effect of adding a negative charge to the filter concerns selectivity, not guaranteed complete inactivation.\n- B is inconsistent with electrostatics, since a negatively charged filter disfavors anions (Cl^{-}).\n- C is unlikely, because adding a high-field-strength ligand typically shifts selectivity away from the larger monovalent K^{+} toward higher charge density ions, not toward enhanced K^{+} selectivity.\n- D matches the field-strength argument: the filter loses monovalent selectivity and becomes relatively more favorable to divalent cations such as Ca^{2+}.\n- E focuses on voltage sensing and gating, which are determined primarily by separate structural elements; a selectivity filter substitution is not expected to fundamentally reset the voltage-activation threshold in the manner described.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is that the channel will lose its selectivity for monovalent cations and preferentially transport divalent cations such as Ca^{2+}.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2339518"}]}
