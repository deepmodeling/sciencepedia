All necessary parameters are provided to solve for the stationary population fraction using established theory.\n\nThe system is described as a two-state Markov process, with states denoted as $A$ and $B$, corresponding to the local minima of the potential $U(x)$. Let $P_A$ and $P_B$ be the stationary fractions of the cell population in state $A$ and state $B$, respectively. By definition, these fractions must sum to unity:\n$$\nP_A + P_B = 1\n$$\nIn the stationary regime, the principle of detailed balance requires that the flux of cells from state $A$ to state $B$ equals the flux from state $B$ to state $A$.

The solution within an epoch of duration $L_e$ is\n$$\nf(t) = s_e + \\left(f(0) - s_e\\right)e^{-\\sigma t}, \\quad t \\in [0,L_e].\n$$\nThe instantaneous per-time log growth rate of the total population in environment $e$ is the weighted average of phenotype-specific rates, consistent with rapid re-randomization at the single-cell level within each small time interval:\n$$\ng_e\\left(f(t)\\right) = f(t)\\,\\mu_{1,e} + \\left(1 - f(t)\\right)\\mu_{2,e}.\n$$\nThe integrated contribution of an epoch of length $L_e$ to the cumulative log population size is\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L_e} g_e\\left(f(t)\\right)\\,dt = \\mu_{2,e}L_e + \\left(\\mu_{1,e} - \\mu_{2,e}\\right)\\int_{0}^{L_e} f(t)\\,dt,\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L_e} f(t)\\,dt = s_e L_e + \\left(f(0) - s_e\\right)\\frac{1 - e^{-\\sigma L_e}}{\\sigma}.\n$$\nOver many alternating epochs, under stationarity, the long-run average per-time log growth rate is the expected integrated log growth per cycle divided by the expected cycle length. Because $f(0)$ depends on the previous epoch via linear relaxation, its stationary expectation can be computed using renewal theory and linearity. Let $a_e = \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\sigma L_e}\\right]$ and $m_e = \\mathbb{E}\\left[L_e\\right]$. Denote $X = \\mathbb{E}\\left[f(0)\\mid \\text{start of environment }1\\right]$ and $Y = \\mathbb{E}\\left[f(0)\\mid \\text{start of environment }2\\right]$. Under alternation, they satisfy the linear system\n$$\nY = s_1 + (X - s_1)a_1, \\quad X = s_2 + (Y - s_2)a_2.\n$$\nSolving yields\n$$\nX = \\frac{s_2(1 - a_2) + s_1 a_2(1 - a_1)}{1 - a_1 a_2}, \\quad Y = s_1 + (X - s_1)a_1.\n$$\nThe expected integrated fraction over an epoch in environment $e$ becomes\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{L_e} f(t)\\,dt\\right] = s_e m_e + \\left(\\mathbb{E}[f(0)] - s_e\\right)\\frac{1 - a_e}{\\sigma},\n$$\nand the long-run average per-time log growth rate is\n$$\n\\Gamma(s_1,s_2) = \\frac{\\sum_{e=1}^{2}\\left(\\mu_{2,e} m_e + \\left(\\mu_{1,e} - \\mu_{2,e}\\right)\\left[s_e m_e + \\left(\\mathbb{E}[f(0)] - s_e\\right)\\frac{1 - a_e}{\\sigma}\\right]\\right)}{m_1 + m_2}.\n$$\n\nYou must implement two counterposed environment dwell time models:\n- Exponential (Markovian) case: $L_e \\sim \\text{Exponential}(\\lambda_e)$ with $m_e = 1/\\lambda_e$ and $a_e = \\lambda_e/(\\lambda_e + \\sigma)$.\n- Power-law (non-Markovian) case: $L_e \\sim \\text{Pareto}(L_{\\min,e}, \\alpha_e)$ with probability density function $p(l) = \\alpha_e L_{\\min,e}^{\\alpha_e} l^{-(\\alpha_e + 1)}$ for $l \\ge L_{\\min,e}$, mean $m_e = \\alpha_e L_{\\min,e}/(\\alpha_e - 1)$ for $\\alpha_e > 1$, and\n$$\na_e = \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\sigma L_e}\\right] = \\int_{L_{\\min,e}}^{\\infty} e^{-\\sigma l}\\,\\alpha_e L_{\\min,e}^{\\alpha_e} l^{-(\\alpha_e + 1)}\\,dl,\n$$\nwhich must be computed numerically.\n\nBet-hedging policy consists of environment-dependent target fractions $s_1 \\in [0,1]$ and $s_2 \\in [0,1]$. For each dwell time model, your program must search over a discretized grid of $(s_1,s_2)$ to find the pair that maximizes $\\Gamma(s_1,s_2)$.\n\nTime is measured in arbitrary consistent time units; report all outputs as dimensionless real numbers.\n\nTest Suite and Output Specification:\n- Use the following three test cases, each specifying phenotype growth rates, mean dwell times, adaptation rates, and non-Markovian parameters.

            "solution": "The problem presents a valid and well-posed question in theoretical biology, specifically concerning optimal bet-hedging strategies in fluctuating environments. It requires the construction and analysis of a model to compare the effects of Markovian (exponential) versus non-Markovian (power-law) environmental switching on a population's long-term fitness. All necessary parameters and equations are provided, the underlying scientific principles are sound, and the problem is computationally tractable.\n\nThe model considers a population composed of two phenotypes, indexed by $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, existing in one of two environments, $e \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. The environments alternate deterministically. In environment $e$, each phenotype $i$ has a constant per-capita instantaneous exponential growth rate, $\\mu_{i,e}$. The duration of an epoch in environment $e$ is a random variable $L_e$.\n\nThe fraction of phenotype $1$ at time $t$ is denoted by $f(t)$. Phenotype switching dynamics are governed by a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE), which describes relaxation towards an environment-specific target fraction $s_e \\in [0, 1]$ at a constant rate $\\sigma > 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dt} = \\sigma\\left(s_e - f(t)\\right)\n$$\nGiven an initial fraction $f(0)$ at the start of an epoch in environment $e$ with duration $L_e$, the solution to the ODE is:\n$$\nf(t) = s_e + \\left(f(0) - s_e\\right)e^{-\\sigma t}, \\quad \\text{for } t \\in [0, L_e]\n$$\nThe instantaneous log growth rate of the total population, $g_e(f(t))$, is the weighted average of the individual phenotype growth rates:\n$$\ng_e\\left(f(t)\\right) = f(t)\\,\\mu_{1,e} + \\left(1 - f(t)\\right)\\mu_{2,e}\n$$\nThe total log-growth accumulated during one epoch in environment $e$ is the integral of $g_e(f(t))$ over the duration $L_e$. By integrating $f(t)$, we find the integrated contribution to be:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L_e} g_e\\left(f(t)\\right)\\,dt = \\mu_{2,e}L_e + \\left(\\mu_{1,e} - \\mu_{2,e}\\right)\\int_{0}^{L_e} f(t)\\,dt\n$$\nwhere the integrated fraction is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L_e} f(t)\\,dt = s_e L_e + \\left(f(0) - s_e\\right)\\frac{1 - e^{-\\sigma L_e}}{\\sigma}\n$$\nThe primary objective is to maximize the long-run average per-time log growth rate, $\\Gamma$, which is the expected total log-growth per environmental cycle divided by the expected cycle length. A cycle consists of one epoch in environment $1$ followed by one in environment $2$. To compute this, we first establish the stationary expectations of the initial phenotype fractions. Let $X = \\mathbb{E}\\left[f(0)\\mid \\text{start of env }1\\right]$ and $Y = \\mathbb{E}\\left[f(0)\\mid \\text{start of env }2\\right]$. At stationarity, the expected fraction at the end of one epoch is the expected initial fraction of the next. This leads to a system of linear equations, where $a_e = \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\sigma L_e}\\right]$:\n$$\nY = s_1 + (X - s_1)a_1\n$$\n$$\nX = s_2 + (Y - s_2)a_2\n$$\nSolving for $X$ and $Y$ yields:\n$$\nX = \\frac{s_2(1 - a_2) + s_1 a_2(1 - a_1)}{1 - a_1 a_2}, \\quad Y = s_1 + (X - s_1)a_1\n$$\nThe expected integrated fraction over an epoch in environment $e$ (e.g., $e=1$, starting with initial fraction $X$) is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{L_1} f(t)\\,dt\\right] = s_1 \\mathbb{E}[L_1] + \\left(X - s_1\\right)\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1 - e^{-\\sigma L_1}}{\\sigma}\\right] = s_1 m_1 + \\left(X - s_1\\right)\\frac{1 - a_1}{\\sigma}\n$$\nwhere $m_e = \\mathbb{E}[L_e]$. A similar expression holds for environment $2$. Summing the expected contributions from both environments and dividing by the expected cycle time $m_1 + m_2$ gives the long-run growth rate $\\Gamma(s_1,s_2)$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(s_1,s_2) = \\frac{\\sum_{e=1}^{2}\\left(\\mu_{2,e} m_e + \\left(\\mu_{1,e} - \\mu_{2,e}\\right)\\left[s_e m_e + \\left(\\mathbb{E}[f(0)]_e - s_e\\right)\\frac{1 - a_e}{\\sigma}\\right]\\right)}{m_1 + m_2}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbb{E}[f(0)]_1 = X$ and $\\mathbb{E}[f(0)]_2 = Y$.\n\nThe analysis compares two models for the dwell time distributions $L_e$, both calibrated to have the same mean $m_e$:\n1.  **Exponential (Markovian) Case**: The dwell times follow an exponential distribution, $L_e \\sim \\text{Exponential}(\\lambda_e)$. The mean is $m_e = 1/\\lambda_e$. The term $a_e$ can be calculated analytically:\n    $$\n    a_e = \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\sigma L_e}\\right] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\sigma l} \\lambda_e e^{-\\lambda_e l} dl = \\frac{\\lambda_e}{\\lambda_e + \\sigma}\n    $$\n2.  **Power-Law (Non-Markovian) Case**: The dwell times follow a Pareto distribution, $L_e \\sim \\text{Pareto}(L_{\\min,e}, \\alpha_e)$, with probability density function $p(l) = \\alpha_e L_{\\min,e}^{\\alpha_e} l^{-(\\alpha_e + 1)}$ for $l \\ge L_{\\min,e}$. The mean is $m_e = \\frac{\\alpha_e L_{\\min,e}}{\\alpha_e - 1}$ for $\\alpha_e > 1$. The parameter $L_{\\min,e}$ is set to $m_e(\\alpha_e - 1)/\\alpha_e$ to match the mean $m_e$. The term $a_e$ must be computed by numerical integration:\n    $$\n    a_e = \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\sigma L_e}\\right] = \\int_{L_{\\min,e}}^{\\infty} e^{-\\sigma l}\\,\\alpha_e L_{\\min,e}^{\\alpha_e} l^{-(\\alpha_e + 1)}\\,dl\n    $$\n\nThe optimal bet-hedging strategy, defined by the pair of target fractions $(s_1, s_2)$, is found by maximizing $\\Gamma(s_1, s_2)$. This is achieved by performing a grid search over the parameter space $s_1 \\in [0, 1]$ and $s_2 \\in [0, 1]$ with a fine step size of $0.01$. For each test case, this optimization is performed for both the exponential and power-law models.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  For each test case, extract the parameters $\\mu_{i,e}$, $m_e$, $\\sigma$, and $\\alpha_e$.\n2.  Create a discrete grid of $(s_1,s_2)$ values from $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n3.  For the exponential model, calculate $\\lambda_e=1/m_e$ and the corresponding $a_e$.\n4.  For the power-law model, calculate $L_{\\min,e}$ and numerically compute $a_e$.\n5.  For each model, iterate through all $(s_1,s_2)$ pairs on the grid. In each iteration:\n    a. Calculate the stationary initial fractions $X$ and $Y$ using the respective $a_1$ and $a_2$.\n    b. Calculate the long-run growth rate $\\Gamma(s_1, s_2)$.\n    c. Keep track of the maximum $\\Gamma$ found and the corresponding $(s_1, s_2)$ pair.\n6.  Store the optimal $(\\Gamma, s_1, s_2)$ for both models for the current test case.\n7.  After processing all test cases, format the results into the specified string representation.\nThe implementation uses `numpy` for efficient array operations and `scipy.integrate.quad` for the numerical integration required in the power-law case.",
