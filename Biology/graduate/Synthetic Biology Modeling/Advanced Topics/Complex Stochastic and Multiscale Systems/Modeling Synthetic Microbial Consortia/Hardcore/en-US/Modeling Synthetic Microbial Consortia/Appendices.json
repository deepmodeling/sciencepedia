Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Steady-State AHL Concentration, $A^{*}$**\n\nThe first step is to formulate a dynamic mass balance for the concentration of AHL, denoted by $A(t)$, within the chemostat. The rate of change of the AHL concentration, $\\frac{dA}{dt}$, is the sum of the rates of all processes that add or remove AHL from the system. In a well-mixed system of constant volume, we can write the balance on a concentration basis:\n\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of production}) - (\\text{Rate of degradation}) - (\\text{Rate of outflow}) $$\n\nLet's analyze each term based on the provided information:\n1.  **Rate of production:** The volumetric production rate is given as $\\sigma X$. This term contributes positively to the rate of change of concentration. Its units are $\\mathrm{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n2.  **Rate of degradation:** The chemical degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $\\delta$. The rate of loss is therefore proportional to the current concentration, $A$. This term contributes $-\\delta A$. Its units are $[\\mathrm{s}^{-1}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{M}] = \\mathrm{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n3.  **Rate of outflow:** AHL is removed from the chemostat by dilution at a rate $D$. The concentration of AHL in the outflow is the same as the concentration inside the well-mixed reactor, $A$. The influent concentration is zero. Thus, the net effect of flow is a loss term, $-D A$. Its units are $[\\mathrm{s}^{-1}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{M}] = \\mathrm{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nCombining these terms yields the ordinary differential equation governing the AHL concentration:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\sigma X - \\delta A - D A $$\n\nThis equation can be simplified by factoring out $A$ from the loss terms:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\sigma X - (\\delta + D) A $$\n\nAt steady-state, the concentration of AHL no longer changes with time. Therefore, we set the time derivative to zero, $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$, and solve for the steady-state concentration, which we denote as $A^{*}$.\n\n$$ 0 = \\sigma X - (\\delta + D) A^{*} $$\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for $A^{*}$:\n$$ (\\delta + D) A^{*} = \\sigma X $$\n$$ A^{*} = \\frac{\\sigma X}{\\delta + D} $$\n\nThis expression represents the steady-state AHL concentration as a function of the cell density $X$, the production rate constant $\\sigma$, the degradation rate constant $\\delta$, and the dilution rate $D$.\n\n**Derivation of the Minimal Cell Density Threshold, $X_{\\mathrm{th}}$**\n\nThe problem defines a \"quorum response\" as the condition where the steady-state activation level reaches at least one-half of its maximum. It is explicitly stated that this is equivalent to the steady-state AHL concentration $A^{*}$ being greater than or equal to the half-maximal concentration constant $K$. This condition is expressed as:\n$$ A^{*} \\geq K $$\n\nTo find the minimal cell density required to achieve this response, we substitute our derived expression for $A^{*}$ into this inequality:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma X}{\\delta + D} \\geq K $$\n\nWe now solve this inequality for the cell density $X$. The parameters $\\sigma$, $\\delta$, $D$, and $K$ are all positive physical constants. Therefore, we can multiply both sides by $(\\delta + D)$ and divide by $\\sigma$ without changing the direction of the inequality.\n\n$$ \\sigma X \\geq K (\\delta + D) $$\n$$ X \\geq \\frac{K (\\delta + D)}{\\sigma} $$\n\nThis inequality indicates that a quorum response will only occur if the cell density $X$ is at or above a specific value. This minimum required value is the cell density threshold for quorum response, denoted as $X_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n$$ X_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{K (\\delta + D)}{\\sigma} $$\n\nThis expression defines the minimal cell density required to trigger the quorum response in terms of the system's biophysical parameters.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the steady-state AHL concentration $A^{*}$ and the minimal cell density threshold $X_{\\mathrm{th}}$.",

Thus, the mutualistic feedback destabilizes this equilibrium.\nThe question asks for the largest real part of the eigenvalues, rounded to four significant figures.\n$0.4197$ rounded to four significant figures is $0.4197$. Using slightly more precision from the start: $\\sqrt{0.018} \\approx 0.13416407865$. $x^{**} \\approx 10.854101966$. The eigenvalues are $0.41976...$ and $-23.1279...$. Rounding $0.41976$ to four significant figures gives $0.4198$.",
