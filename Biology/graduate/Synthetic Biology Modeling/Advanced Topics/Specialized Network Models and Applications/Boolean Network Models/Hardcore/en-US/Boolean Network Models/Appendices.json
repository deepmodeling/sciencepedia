This exercise provides foundational practice in applying the synchronous update rules of a Boolean network.

            "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is modeling a simple gene regulatory network within an engineered bacterium. The network consists of three genes, which we will label A, B, and C. The state of each gene can be either \"ON\" (active), represented by the integer 1, or \"OFF\" (inactive), represented by the integer 0. The state of the entire network evolves in discrete time steps. The states of all three genes are updated simultaneously (synchronously) based on the network's state at the previous time step.\n\nThe regulatory logic is as follows:\n- Gene A is activated at time $t+1$ if, at time $t$, either gene B was ON or gene C was ON. Otherwise, gene A is turned OFF.\n- Gene B's regulation involves a self-inhibitory loop and an external override. At time $t+1$, gene B will be in the opposite state to its state at time $t$, unless gene C was ON at time $t$. If gene C was ON at time $t$, gene B is forced OFF at time $t+1$ regardless of its previous state.\n- Gene C is activated at time $t+1$ if and only if gene A was ON and gene B was OFF at time $t$. For all other conditions, gene C is turned OFF.\n\nIf the network starts at time $t=0$ with gene A OFF, gene B ON, and gene C OFF, what is the state of the network (A, B, C) at time $t=3$?

A network's evolution can be modeled using different update schemes. In a synchronous scheme, all nodes update their states simultaneously at each discrete time step.
