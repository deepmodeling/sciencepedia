The derivation will be founded on the principle of detailed balance at equilibrium, combined with the Transition State Theory (TST) expression for rate constants.\n\nFirst, we invoke the principle of detailed balance. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the rate of every elementary process is equal to the rate of its reverse process. For the reaction $A \\rightleftharpoons B$, this means the forward reaction rate, $v_f$, must equal the reverse reaction rate, $v_r$. The rates are given by mass-action kinetics:\n$$v_f = k_f [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$$\n$$v_r = k_r [B]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$$\nwhere $k_f$ and $k_r$ are the forward and reverse rate constants, respectively, and $[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ and $[B]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ are the concentrations at equilibrium.\n\nAt equilibrium, $v_f = v_r$, which implies:\n$$k_f [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = k_r [B]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$$\n\nThe standard equilibrium constant, $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, is defined by the ratio of the equilibrium concentrations of products to reactants (raised to their stoichiometric powers, which are $1$ in this case):\n$$K_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{[B]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$$\n\nBy rearranging the detailed balance equation, we can express $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ as the ratio of the rate constants:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_f}{k_r}$$\n\nNext, we use the provided Transition State Theory (TST) rate law to express $k_f$ and $k_r$. The general form is:\n$$k = \\kappa \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{h}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{R T}\\right)$$\nApplying this to the forward and reverse reactions, we have:\n$$k_f = \\kappa \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{h}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{f}}{R T}\\right)$$\n$$k_r = \\kappa \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{h}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{r}}{R T}\\right)$$\nHere, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{f}$ and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{r}$ are the standard Gibbs free energies of activation for the forward and reverse directions, respectively. The problem states that the transmission coefficient, $\\kappa$, is the same for both directions. The pre-exponential factor $\\kappa \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{h}\\right)$ is therefore identical for $k_f$ and $k_r$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions for the rate constants into our equation for $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{\\kappa \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{h}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{f}}{R T}\\right)}{\\kappa \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{h}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{r}}{R T}\\right)}$$\n\nThe common pre-exponential terms cancel, simplifying the expression significantly:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{f}}{R T}\\right)}{\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{r}}{R T}\\right)}$$\n\nUsing the property of exponents $\\frac{\\exp(a)}{\\exp(b)} = \\exp(a-b)$, we obtain the closed-form expression for $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ in terms of the activation energies:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{f}}{R T} - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{r}}{R T}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{r} - \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{f}}{R T}\\right)$$\nThis is the required derived expression. It demonstrates that the equilibrium constant is determined by the difference between the forward and reverse activation energy barriers.\n\nFor completeness, we can relate this to the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$. From a reaction energy profile, the difference in the energies of the product and reactant states is $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{product}} - G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{reactant}}$. This is also equal to the difference between the activation energies: $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{f} - \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{r}$.
