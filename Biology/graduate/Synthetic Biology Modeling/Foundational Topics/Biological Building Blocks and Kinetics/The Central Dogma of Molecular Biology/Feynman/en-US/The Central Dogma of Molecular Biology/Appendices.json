This exercise moves beyond a qualitative appreciation of this fidelity to build a quantitative, probabilistic model. By combining the known error rates of the key molecular players—DNA polymerase, exonuclease proofreading, and the mismatch repair system—you will calculate the expected number of mutations that arise during a single round of genome replication, providing a tangible understanding of how cells preserve their genetic blueprint .",

            "problem": "A eukaryotic cell replicates a linear genome comprising $3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ nucleotide positions during each cell division. At each position, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase misincorporates a nucleotide with marginal probability $\\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} = 10^{-5}$. Conditional on a misincorporation event having occurred at the 3-prime terminus, the exonuclease proofreading mechanism attempts to remove the mismatch; the conditional probability that proofreading fails to correct the mismatch is $\\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} = 10^{-2}$. Conditional on a post-replicative mismatch persisting, the mismatch repair (MMR) system attempts to correct it; the conditional probability that mismatch repair fails is $\\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} = 10^{-1}$. Assume independence of error events across positions and conditional independence of correction failures given the presence of a mismatch. A base substitution becomes a fixed mutation only if a misincorporation occurs and both correction systems fail before the next replication cycle.\n\nWithin the framework of the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, where high-fidelity replication preserves information flow from DNA to DNA, use only the definitions above and first principles of probability and expectation to derive an expression for the expected number of replication-induced base substitutions per cell division across the $3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ positions. Then evaluate this expectation numerically using the given parameter values. Report the final number of substitutions per division as an exact number (no rounding, no units).\n\nFinally, based on your result and established qualitative knowledge of replication fidelity in normal human somatic cells with intact proofreading and mismatch repair, briefly assess in words whether the magnitude you computed is biologically plausible, and justify your reasoning qualitatively (your qualitative assessment will not affect the numerical answer requirement).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the expected number of base substitutions that become fixed in a genome after one cycle of replication. This quantity is determined by the interplay of error introduction by DNA polymerase and subsequent correction by two major repair systems: proofreading and mismatch repair. The foundation of the solution lies in probability theory, specifically the calculation of the probability of a sequence of dependent events, and the application of the linearity of expectation.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of nucleotide positions in the genome, which is given as $N = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$.\nA base substitution becomes a fixed mutation at a single position if and only if a sequence of three events occurs: an initial misincorporation, a failure of proofreading, and a subsequent failure of mismatch repair. We must calculate the probability of this compound event.\n\nLet us define the events for a single nucleotide position:\n- $M$: The event that DNA polymerase misincorporates a nucleotide. The probability is given as $P(M) = \\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} = 10^{-5}$.\n- $F_P$: The event that the exonuclease proofreading mechanism fails to correct the mismatch. This is a conditional event, dependent on the occurrence of a misincorporation. The problem provides the conditional probability $P(F_P | M) = \\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} = 10^{-2}$.\n- $F_{MMR}$: The event that the mismatch repair (MMR) system fails to correct the mismatch. This event is conditional on a mismatch having persisted through both replication and proofreading, i.e., conditional on the event $M \\cap F_P$. The problem provides the conditional probability $P(F_{MMR} | M \\cap F_P) = \\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} = 10^{-1}$.\n\nThe probability of a single fixed substitution, which we denote as $\\mu$, is the probability of the intersection of these three events: $\\mu = P(M \\cap F_P \\cap F_{MMR})$. Using the chain rule for probabilities, we can express $\\mu$ as follows:\n$$ \\mu = P(M) \\times P(F_P | M) \\times P(F_{MMR} | M \\cap F_P) $$\nThe problem statement provides all the necessary probabilities on the right-hand side. Substituting the given symbolic parameters:\n$$ \\mu = \\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} $$\nThis expression represents the probability of a fixed mutation arising at any single nucleotide position during one cell division.\n\nNow, we must find the expected total number of such mutations across the entire genome of $N$ positions. Let $X$ be a random variable representing the total number of substitutions per cell division. We can define $N$ indicator random variables, $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_N$, where $X_i = 1$ if a fixed substitution occurs at position $i$, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise. The probability that $X_i = 1$ is precisely $\\mu$, as calculated above.\nThe total number of substitutions is the sum of these indicator variables: $X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values:\n$$ E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i] $$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable $X_i$ is equal to the probability of the event it indicates: $E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = P(X_i=1) = \\mu$.\nSince the probability of mutation $\\mu$ is assumed to be identical for all positions, the sum simplifies to:\n$$ E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mu = N \\cdot \\mu $$\nThus, the final expression for the expected number of substitutions is:\n$$ E[X] = N \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} $$\nWe now proceed to the numerical evaluation using the given parameter values:\n$N = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$\n$\\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} = 10^{-5}$\n$\\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} = 10^{-2}$\n$\\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} = 10^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the single-site mutation probability, $\\mu$:\n$$ \\mu = (10^{-5}) \\times (10^{-2}) \\times (10^{-1}) = 10^{-5-2-1} = 10^{-8} $$\nThis is the per-site, per-replication mutation rate.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected total number of substitutions, $E[X]$:\n$$ E[X] = (3.2 \\times 10^{9}) \\times (10^{-8}) = 3.2 \\times 10^{9-8} = 3.2 \\times 10^{1} = 32 $$\nThe expected number of replication-induced base substitutions per cell division is therefore $32$.\n\nFinally, we assess the biological plausibility of this result. The calculated overall mutation rate of $\\mu = 10^{-8}$ mutations per base pair per replication cycle is a textbook value, highly consistent with measurements of the germline mutation rate in humans and other mammals. The resulting expectation of $32$ new mutations for a genome of size $3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ base pairs is also well within the range of established biological estimates. Empirical studies of *de novo* mutations in humans, which accumulate over cell divisions, report tens of new mutations per generation. An expectation of $32$ mutations arising from a single round of replication of the genome is therefore a scientifically sound and plausible magnitude. It correctly quantifies the outcome of a process where an immense number of nucleotides are copied with extraordinarily high, yet imperfect, fidelity. The Central Dogma's tenet of information preservation from DNA to DNA is maintained with high fidelity, but this calculation demonstrates that it is not absolute.",

            "problem": "You are to implement a mechanistic simulation that couples translation to messenger RNA (mRNA) decay in order to quantify how ribosome queueing alters mRNA stability. Use the central dogma of molecular biology as the foundational base: translation is the ribosome-mediated decoding of codons on an mRNA into a polypeptide, proceeding unidirectionally along the mRNA, while mRNA decay is executed by ribonucleases whose access is impeded by ribosome occupancy. The translation dynamics must be modeled as a Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP), which is a continuous-time stochastic process with unidirectional moves and hard exclusion, and the mRNA decay must be modeled by a hazard (instantaneous decay rate) that monotonically decreases as a function of the average ribosome coverage (fraction of codons protected by ribosomes). Your task is to compute the effective mRNA lifetime from mechanistic first principles.\n\nModel specification to implement:\n- Lattice and particles:\n  - The mRNA comprises $L$ codon sites labeled $1,2,\\dots,L$.\n  - Each ribosome is an extended particle with footprint length $\\ell$ codons. A ribosome at head position $p$ ($1 \\le p \\le L - \\ell + 1$) occupies codons $p, p+1, \\dots, p+\\ell-1$.\n- Kinetics:\n  - Initiation occurs at rate $\\alpha$ (in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) if and only if codons $1$ through $\\ell$ are empty; initiation places a ribosome with head at $p=1$.\n  - Elongation is site-dependent: the per-codon elongation rate array $\\{k_i\\}_{i=1}^L$ (in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) assigns a rate to each codon. A ribosome with head at $p$ attempts to advance its head to $p+1$ at rate $k_{p+\\ell-1}$ provided that codon $p+\\ell$ is empty (hard exclusion). If $p = L - \\ell + 1$, an attempted advance corresponds to termination and the ribosome exits at rate $k_L$, vacating its entire footprint.\n  - All reactions occur in continuous time and are executed one at a time according to the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm: at any state, enumerate all currently enabled events and their rates, draw the next reaction time as an exponential random variable with mean equal to the inverse of the total rate, and select which event fires proportional to its rate.\n- Coverage:\n  - Define the instantaneous coverage $\\rho(t)$ as the fraction of codons currently occupied by any ribosome at time $t$, i.e., the number of occupied codons divided by $L$.\n  - Define the time-average coverage over a measurement window as $\\bar{\\rho} = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{meas}}} \\int_{t_0}^{t_0 + T_{\\mathrm{meas}}} \\rho(t)\\, dt$, where $t_0$ is a warm-up time to allow the TASEP to approach stationarity, and $T_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ is the duration of the measurement window.\n- Decay coupling and lifetime:\n  - Let the baseline (unprotected) decay rate be $\\delta_0$ (in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Couple decay to coverage by the monotone, strictly positive mapping\n    $$ \\delta(\\bar{\\rho}) = \\delta_0 \\exp(-\\beta \\bar{\\rho}), $$\n    where $\\beta \\ge 0$ is a dimensionless parameter controlling the strength of ribosome protection.\n  - Under the assumption that the coverage process reaches a stationary regime on a timescale fast compared to mRNA decay, treat $\\delta(\\bar{\\rho})$ as constant over mRNA lifetime. The effective mRNA lifetime is then\n    $$ \\tau = \\frac{1}{\\delta(\\bar{\\rho})}. $$\n  - Report $\\tau$ in seconds, rounded to $3$ decimal places.\n- Simulation protocol and units:\n  - Use seconds for time and $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for all rates.\n  - Use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation of the extended-particle TASEP to estimate $\\bar{\\rho}$ via time averaging. Use a warm-up of $T_{\\mathrm{warm}} = 40$ seconds followed by a measurement window of $T_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 160$ seconds (so total simulated time $T_{\\mathrm{total}} = 200$ seconds).

In each case, define $k_i$ (in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) as follows: unless otherwise specified, $k_i = 10$ for all $i$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all parameters and kinetic rules for the simulation are defined unambiguously. The model combines the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP), a canonical model in statistical physics for transport phenomena, with a biologically motivated mechanism for mRNA decay modulation by ribosome protection. The task is to compute a derived quantity, the effective mRNA lifetime, through direct stochastic simulation. The methodology follows from the problem specification.\n\nThe core of the solution is the implementation of the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) for the specified continuous-time Markov process. The state of the system at any time $t$ is fully described by the set of positions of the ribosomes on the mRNA lattice. Computationally, we represent this state using a sorted list of integer head positions $\\{p_j\\}$ for each ribosome $j$ on the lattice. This representation is efficient for identifying possible kinetic events.\n\nThe simulation proceeds by iteratively executing kinetic events. At each step, we first enumerate all possible events that can occur from the current state and their associated rates:\n- **Initiation**: A new ribosome can initiate translation and be placed with its head at position $p=1$. This event is possible if and only if the entire footprint required, codons $1$ through $\\ell$, is unoccupied. The rate of this event, if it is possible, is the constant initiation rate $\\alpha$.\n- **Advancement**: Each ribosome $j$ already on the lattice, located at head position $p_j$, may advance to $p_j+1$. This event represents one step of elongation or, if $p_j = L - \\ell + 1$, termination. The event is possible only if there is no steric hindrance. For an extended particle of footprint $\\ell$, a move from $p_j$ to $p_j+1$ requires that the site $p_j+\\ell$ is unoccupied. The next ribosome in the sequence is at position $p_{j+1}$, so this condition is equivalent to $p_{j+1} > p_j+\\ell$. For termination, the ribosome at $p_j = L - \\ell+1$ moves off the lattice, so its destination is always considered free. The rate of advancement from position $p_j$ is given by the site-dependent elongation rate $k_{p_j+\\ell-1}$.\n\nOnce the list of all possible events and their rates $\\{r_i\\}$ is compiled, the Gillespie algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. The total rate of any event occurring is calculated: $R_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_i r_i$. If $R_{\\text{total}} = 0$, the system has reached an absorbing state, and the simulation time is advanced to the end of the measurement period.\n2. The time until the next event, $\\Delta t$, is drawn from an exponential distribution with mean $1/R_{\\text{total}}$, i.e., $\\Delta t = -(1/R_{\\text{total}}) \\ln(U_1)$, where $U_1$ is a random variate from a uniform distribution on $(0,1)$.\n3. An event $j$ is chosen to occur with probability $r_j / R_{\\text{total}}$. This is achieved by drawing a second uniform random variate $U_2$ and selecting the event $j$ that satisfies $\\sum_{i=1}^{j-1} r_i < U_2 R_{\\text{total}} \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{j} r_i$.\n4. The system state is updated according to the selected event (a ribosome is added, moved, or removed), and the simulation time is advanced by $\\Delta t$.\n\nTo compute the time-average coverage $\\bar{\\rho}$, we must evaluate the integral $\\bar{\\rho} = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{meas}}} \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{warm}}}^{T_{\\mathrm{warm}} + T_{\\mathrm{meas}}} \\rho(t)\\, dt$. Numerically, this is done by accumulating the product of the instantaneous coverage $\\rho(t)$ and the duration $\\Delta t$ for which the system remains in that state. The instantaneous coverage is $\\rho(t) = N(t) \\cdot \\ell / L$, where $N(t)$ is the number of ribosomes on the mRNA. During the simulation loop, for each time step $\\Delta t$ occurring between time $t$ and $t+\\Delta t$, we add the contribution $\\rho(t) \\cdot \\Delta t'$ to a running total, where $\\Delta t'$ is the portion of the $[t, t+\\Delta t)$ interval that falls within the measurement window $[T_{\\mathrm{warm}}, T_{\\mathrm{warm}}+T_{\\mathrm{meas}}]$.\n\nAfter the simulation completes at total time $T_{\\mathrm{total}} = T_{\\mathrm{warm}} + T_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, the time-averaged coverage is calculated as $\\bar{\\rho} = (\\text{accumulated integral}) / T_{\\mathrm{meas}}$.\n\nFinally, the effective mRNA lifetime $\\tau$ is determined from this average coverage using the provided formula, which models the protective effect of ribosomes against degradation by ribonucleases:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{1}{\\delta(\\bar{\\rho})} = \\frac{1}{\\delta_0 \\exp(-\\beta \\bar{\\rho})} $$\nThe entire procedure is repeated for each set of parameters specified in the test suite, using a fixed random seed for reproducibility.
