            "solution": "The problem requires a thorough analysis of a reversible enzyme-catalyzed reaction using two common approximations: the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) and the Rapid Equilibrium Assumption (REA). The analysis will proceed in three stages: first, an assessment of the theoretical validity of these approximations under the given conditions; second, a first-principles derivation of the net reaction rate under each approximation; and third, the computation of the relative error between the two predicted rates.\n\nThe reaction mechanism is given by:\n$$E + S \\overset{k_{1}}{\\underset{k_{-1}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\overset{k_{2}}{\\underset{k_{-2}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} E + P$$\nThe total enzyme concentration is conserved, such that $[E] = E_T - [ES]$, where $E_T = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}$. The concentrations of substrate and product are given as $[S] = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ and $[P] = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$, respectively.\n\n**1. Assessment of the QSSA and REA Validity**\n\nThe validity of these approximations depends on the relative timescales of the processes involved, which can be inferred from the given kinetic parameters and concentrations.\n\nFirst, we assess the **Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA)**. The QSSA assumes that the concentration of the intermediate enzyme-substrate complex, $[ES]$, changes much more slowly than the concentrations of the substrate $[S]$ and product $[P]$. This condition, $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$, is generally valid when the total enzyme concentration is much smaller than the substrate concentration, i.e., $E_T \\ll [S]$.\nGiven $E_T = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ and $[S] = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$, we can evaluate the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{E_T}{[S]} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nSince $E_T$ is more than three orders of magnitude smaller than $[S]$, the condition $E_T \\ll [S]$ is firmly met. Therefore, the QSSA is expected to be a highly accurate approximation for this system.\n\nNext, we assess the **Rapid Equilibrium Assumption (REA)**. The REA assumes that the first step of the reaction, the binding and dissociation of the substrate ($E + S \\rightleftharpoons ES$), is much faster than the second step, the catalytic conversion ($ES \\rightarrow E+P$). This requires the rate of dissociation of the $ES$ complex back to $E$ and $S$ to be much greater than the rate of its forward conversion to $E$ and $P$. Mathematically, this condition is $k_{-1} \\gg k_2$.\nFrom the given parameters:\n- First-order substrate dissociation rate constant: $k_{-1} = 20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- First-order catalytic turnover rate constant: $k_{2} = 40\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nComparing these values, we find that $k_2 > k_{-1}$. The catalytic step is actually faster than the substrate dissociation step. This directly violates the core condition for the REA. Consequently, the REA is expected to fail and yield an inaccurate prediction for the reaction rate under these parameters.\n\n**2. Derivation of Net Reaction Rates**\n\nThe net rate of product formation, $v$, is defined as $v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt}$. From the reaction mechanism, this is given by:\n$$ v = k_2 [ES] - k_{-2} [E][P] $$\nTo find the rate, we must first determine the concentration of the intermediate species, $[ES]$ and $[E]$. The rate of change of $[ES]$ is governed by the law of mass action:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] + k_{-2} [E][P] - (k_{-1} + k_2) [ES] $$\n\n**Net Rate under the QSSA ($v_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}$)**\nWe apply the QSSA, $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = 0$, and substitute the conservation relation $[E] = E_T - [ES]$:\n$$ k_1 (E_T - [ES])[S] + k_{-2} (E_T - [ES])[P] - (k_{-1} + k_2) [ES] = 0 $$\nWe solve this algebraic equation for $[ES]$:\n$$ k_1 E_T [S] - k_1 [ES][S] + k_{-2} E_T [P] - k_{-2} [ES][P] - k_{-1} [ES] - k_2 [ES] = 0 $$\n$$ E_T (k_1 [S] + k_{-2} [P]) = [ES] (k_1 [S] + k_{-2} [P] + k_{-1} + k_2) $$\n$$ [ES]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} = \\frac{E_T (k_1 [S] + k_{-2} [P])}{k_1 [S] + k_{-2} [P] + k_{-1} + k_2} $$\nSubstituting this and $[E] = E_T - [ES]$ into the rate equation $v = k_2 [ES] - k_{-2} [E][P]$ yields the full reversible Michaelis-Menten equation under the QSSA:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} = k_2 [ES]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} - k_{-2} (E_T - [ES]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}})[P] $$\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} = (k_2 + k_{-2}[P])[ES]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} - k_{-2}E_T[P] $$\nSubstituting the expression for $[ES]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}$ and simplifying leads to the canonical form:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} = \\frac{E_T (k_1 k_2 [S] - k_{-1} k_{-2} [P])}{k_1 [S] + k_{-2} [P] + k_{-1} + k_2} $$\n\n**Net Rate under the \"Irreversible REA\" ($v_{\\mathrm{REA}}$)**\nThe problem asks for the rate under the REA, with the clarification that product effects on complex formation are negligible (\"irreversible REA\"). This corresponds to the standard Michaelis-Menten model for an irreversible reaction, $E+S \\rightleftharpoons ES \\rightarrow E+P$, derived using the REA.\nUnder the REA, the binding step $E + S \\rightleftharpoons ES$ is assumed to be at equilibrium. The dissociation constant is $K_S' = \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_1}$.\n$$ K_S' = \\frac{[E][S]}{[ES]} $$\nUsing $[E] = E_T - [ES]$, we solve for $[ES]$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E][S]}{K_S'} = \\frac{(E_T - [ES])[S]}{K_S'} \\implies [ES](K_S' + [S]) = E_T[S] $$\n$$ [ES]_{\\mathrm{REA}} = \\frac{E_T [S]}{K_S' + [S]} $$\nThe net rate for this simplified irreversible model is given solely by the catalytic step, $v = k_2 [ES]$:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{REA}} = k_2 [ES]_{\\mathrm{REA}} = \\frac{k_2 E_T [S]}{K_S' + [S]} = \\frac{k_2 E_T [S]}{(k_{-1}/k_1) + [S]} $$\n\n**3.

The product $R T$ is therefore:\n$$ R T = (8.3145 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (310 \\, \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 2.5775 \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\nUsing the given equilibrium constants, $K_{\\mathrm{eq},1} = 2.0$, $K_{\\mathrm{eq},2} = 0.5$, and $K_{\\mathrm{eq},3} = 1.5$, we calculate the corresponding Gibbs energy changes:\n$$ \\Delta_{1} G^{\\circ'} = - (2.5775) \\ln(2.0) \\approx -1.7865 \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} = - (2.5775) \\ln(0.5) = - (2.5775) (-\\ln(2.0)) \\approx +1.7865 \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'} = - (2.5775) \\ln(1.5) \\approx -1.0451 \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\nLet $\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$ be the column vector of these values: $\\Delta G^{\\circ'} = (\\Delta_{1} G^{\\circ'}, \\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'}, \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'})^T$.\n\nThe second fundamental relationship connects the reaction Gibbs energies to the species' chemical potentials. For each reaction $r$, $\\Delta_{r} G^{\\circ'}$ is the stoichiometric sum of the standard transformed chemical potentials $\\mu_{i}^{\\circ'}$ of the participating species $i$:\n$$ \\Delta_{r} G^{\\circ'} = \\sum_{i} S_{ir} \\mu_{i}^{\\circ'} $$\nwhere $S_{ir}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ in reaction $r$. This set of equations can be expressed concisely in matrix form:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ'} = S^T \\mu^{\\circ'} $$\nwhere $S^T$ is the transpose of the given stoichiometric matrix $S$.\n$$ S^T = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -1  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1  1 \\\\ 1  0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis gives the following system of three linear equations in four unknowns ($\\mu_{A}^{\\circ'}, \\mu_{B}^{\\circ'}, \\mu_{C}^{\\circ'}, \\mu_{D}^{\\circ'}$):\n$$ -\\mu_{A}^{\\circ'} - \\mu_{B}^{\\circ'} + \\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} = \\Delta_{1} G^{\\circ'} \\quad (1) $$\n$$ -\\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} + \\mu_{D}^{\\circ'} = \\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} \\quad (2) $$\n$$ \\mu_{A}^{\\circ'} - \\mu_{D}^{\\circ'} = \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'} \\quad (3) $$\nSince there are more unknowns than independent equations, this system does not have a unique solution. The non-uniqueness is related to the existence of conserved moieties in the reaction network. A conserved moiety corresponds to a linear combination of species concentrations that remains constant over time. The stoichiometric coefficients of such a combination form a vector $l$ in the left null space (kernel) of $S$, i.e., $S^T l = 0$.\n\nWe find the basis for the kernel of $S^T$. Let $l = (l_A, l_B, l_C, l_D)^T$. The condition $S^T l = 0$ yields the system:\n$$ -l_A - l_B + l_C = 0 $$\n$$ -l_C + l_D = 0 $$\n$$ l_A - l_D = 0 $$\nFrom the second and third equations, we get $l_A = l_D$ and $l_C = l_D$, so $l_A = l_C = l_D$. Substituting into the first equation gives $-l_A - l_B + l_A = 0$, which implies $l_B = 0$. Thus, any vector in $\\ker(S^T)$ must be of the form $(k, 0, k, k)^T$ for some scalar $k$. The conserved moiety subspace is one-dimensional, and a basis vector is $l = (1, 0, 1, 1)^T$. This corresponds to the conservation of the total amount of species $A$, $C$, and $D$.\n\nThe existence of this null space vector explains the non-uniqueness of $\\mu^{\\circ'}$. If $\\mu_p^{\\circ'}$ is a particular solution to $S^T \\mu^{\\circ'} = \\Delta G^{\\circ'}$, then any vector $\\mu^{\\circ'} = \\mu_p^{\\circ'} + \\alpha l$ is also a solution for any scalar $\\alpha$, because $S^T(\\mu_p^{\\circ'} + \\alpha l) = S^T\\mu_p^{\\circ'} + \\alpha(S^T l) = \\Delta G^{\\circ'} + \\alpha(0) = \\Delta G^{\\circ'}$.\n\nTo obtain a unique solution, we must impose an additional constraint. The problem provides a gauge constraint by setting the potential corresponding to the conserved moiety to zero:\n$$ \\mu_{A}^{\\circ'} + \\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} + \\mu_{D}^{\\circ'} = 0 \\quad (4) $$\nThis can be written as $l^T \\mu^{\\circ'} = 0$. This provides the fourth independent equation needed to uniquely determine the four components of $\\mu^{\\circ'}$.\n\nWe now solve the system of four linear equations:\n1. $-\\mu_{A}^{\\circ'} - \\mu_{B}^{\\circ'} + \\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} = \\Delta_{1} G^{\\circ'}$\n2. $-\\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} + \\mu_{D}^{\\circ'} = \\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'}$\n3. $\\mu_{A}^{\\circ'} - \\mu_{D}^{\\circ'} = \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'}$\n4. $\\mu_{A}^{\\circ'} + \\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} + \\mu_{D}^{\\circ'} = 0$\n\nFrom (2), $\\mu_{D}^{\\circ'} = \\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'}$.\nFrom (3), $\\mu_{A}^{\\circ'} = \\mu_{D}^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'} = (\\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'}) + \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'}$.\nSubstitute these expressions for $\\mu_{A}^{\\circ'}$ and $\\mu_{D}^{\\circ'}$ into (4):\n$$ (\\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'}) + \\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} + (\\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'}) = 0 $$\n$$ 3\\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} + 2\\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'} = 0 $$\n$$ \\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} = -\\frac{1}{3} (2\\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'}) $$\nNow we can find the other potentials:\n$$ \\mu_{D}^{\\circ'} = \\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} = -\\frac{1}{3} (2\\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'}) + \\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} = \\frac{1}{3} (\\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} - \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'}) $$\n$$ \\mu_{A}^{\\circ'} = \\mu_{D}^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'} = \\frac{1}{3} (\\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} - \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'}) + \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'} = \\frac{1}{3} (\\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} + 2\\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'}) $$\nFinally, from (1), we solve for $\\mu_{B}^{\\circ'}$:\n$$ \\mu_{B}^{\\circ'} = -\\mu_{A}^{\\circ'} + \\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} - \\Delta_{1} G^{\\circ'} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mu_{A}^{\\circ'}$ and $\\mu_{C}^{\\circ'}$:\n$$ \\mu_{B}^{\\circ'} = -\\frac{1}{3}(\\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} + 2\\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'}) - \\frac{1}{3}(2\\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'}) - \\Delta_{1} G^{\\circ'} $$\n$$ \\mu_{B}^{\\circ'} = -\\frac{1}{3}(3\\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} + 3\\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'}) - \\Delta_{1} G^{\\circ'} = -\\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} - \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'} - \\Delta_{1} G^{\\circ'} $$\n$$ \\mu_{B}^{\\circ'} = -(\\Delta_{1} G^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} + \\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'}) $$\nSubstituting the numerical values for $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ'}$ (in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$):\n$\\Delta_{1} G^{\\circ'} = -1.78653$, $\\Delta_{2} G^{\\circ'} = 1.78653$, $\\Delta_{3} G^{\\circ'} = -1.04510$.\n$$ \\mu_{C}^{\\circ'} = -1/3(2 \\times 1.78653 - 1.04510) = -2.52796/3 = -0.84265... \\to -0.8427 $$\n$$ \\mu_{D}^{\\circ'} = 1/3(1.78653 - (-1.04510)) = 2.83163/3 = 0.94387... \\to 0.9439 $$\n$$ \\mu_{A}^{\\circ'} = 1/3(1.78653 + 2 \\times (-1.04510)) = -0.30367/3 = -0.10122... \\to -0.1012 $$\n$$ \\mu_{B}^{\\circ'} = -(-1.78653 + 1.78653 - 1.04510) = 1.04510 \\to 1.045 $$\n\nThe final vector $\\mu^{\\circ'} = (\\mu_{A}^{\\circ'}, \\mu_{B}^{\\circ'}, \\mu_{C}^{\\circ'}, \\mu_{D}^{\\circ'})$ is:\n$(-0.1012, 1.045, -0.8427, 0.9439)$ in units of $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.",
