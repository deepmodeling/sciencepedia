            "problem": "In the study of metabolic networks, the stoichiometry of a system of reactions can be compactly represented by a stoichiometric matrix. Consider a simplified biochemical pathway within a cell involving five distinct molecular species: $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$, $S_4$, and $S_5$. The interconversion of these species is governed by four irreversible, enzyme-catalyzed reactions with rates denoted by $v_1, v_2, v_3$, and $v_4$. The reactions are as follows:\n\n1.  $S_1 \\xrightarrow{v_1} S_2$\n2.  $S_2 \\xrightarrow{v_2} S_3$\n3.  $S_2 \\xrightarrow{v_3} S_4$\n4.  $S_3 + S_4 \\xrightarrow{v_4} S_5$\n\nYour task is to construct the stoichiometric matrix, $N$, for this system. The matrix must be constructed according to the standard convention where each row corresponds to a chemical species and each column corresponds to a reaction. The species should be ordered from $S_1$ to $S_5$ in the rows, and the reactions should be ordered by their index from $v_1$ to $v_4$ in the columns. The entries of the matrix, $N_{ij}$, represent the net change in the quantity of species $i$ for each single turnover of reaction $j$. Reactants are consumed (represented by a negative stoichiometric coefficient) and products are formed (represented by a positive stoichiometric coefficient).",

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nFirst, we verify the atom conservation for the proposed reaction: $3\\,\\mathrm{CO_2} + 5\\,\\mathrm{H_2} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{C_3H_6O_3} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H_2O}$. We count the atoms of each element on the reactant (left) side and the product (right) side.\n\nReactant side:\n-   Carbon (C): $3$ molecules of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ contain $3 \\times 1 = 3$ carbon atoms.\n-   Hydrogen (H): $5$ molecules of $\\mathrm{H_2}$ contain $5 \\times 2 = 10$ hydrogen atoms.\n-   Oxygen (O): $3$ molecules of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ contain $3 \\times 2 = 6$ oxygen atoms.\n\nProduct side:\n-   Carbon (C): $1$ molecule of $\\mathrm{C_3H_6O_3}$ contains $1 \\times 3 = 3$ carbon atoms.\n-   Hydrogen (H): $1$ molecule of $\\mathrm{C_3H_6O_3}$ plus $2$ molecules of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ contain $(1 \\times 6) + (2 \\times 2) = 6 + 4 = 10$ hydrogen atoms.\n-   Oxygen (O): $1$ molecule of $\\mathrm{C_3H_6O_3}$ plus $2$ molecules of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ contain $(1 \\times 3) + (2 \\times 1) = 3 + 2 = 5$ oxygen atoms.\n\nComparison:\n-   Carbon: $3 = 3$ (conserved).\n-   Hydrogen: $10 = 10$ (conserved).\n-   Oxygen: $6 \\neq 5$ (not conserved).\n\nThe given reaction is not stoichiometrically balanced because it violates the conservation of oxygen atoms. We must now determine the correct integer coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ for the general reaction:\n$$a\\,\\mathrm{CO_2} + b\\,\\mathrm{H_2} \\longrightarrow c\\,\\mathrm{C_3H_6O_3} + d\\,\\mathrm{H_2O}$$\nWe construct a system of linear equations based on atom conservation for each element.\n\n1.  Carbon (C) balance:\n    $$a \\times 1 = c \\times 3 \\implies a = 3c$$\n\n2.  Hydrogen (H) balance:\n    $$b \\times 2 = (c \\times 6) + (d \\times 2) \\implies 2b = 6c + 2d \\implies b = 3c + d$$\n\n3.  Oxygen (O) balance:\n    $$a \\times 2 = (c \\times 3) + (d \\times 1) \\implies 2a = 3c + d$$\n\nThis is a system of three equations with four unknowns. The system is underdetermined, as expected for a balancing problem. We can solve for three coefficients in terms of a fourth. Let us express $a$, $b$, and $d$ in terms of $c$.\n\nFrom the carbon balance, we already have $a = 3c$.\n\nSubstitute this expression for $a$ into the oxygen balance equation:\n$$2(3c) = 3c + d$$\n$$6c = 3c + d$$\n$$d = 3c$$\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $d$ into the hydrogen balance equation:\n$$b = 3c + d$$\n$$b = 3c + (3c)$$\n$$b = 6c$$\n\nWe have now expressed all coefficients in terms of $c$:\n$$a = 3c$$\n$$b = 6c$$\n$$d = 3c$$\n\nThe ratio of the coefficients is $(a:b:c:d) = (3c:6c:c:3c)$. To find the smallest set of positive integer coefficients, we choose the smallest positive integer value for $c$ that ensures $a$, $b$, and $d$ are also integers. Setting $c=1$ satisfies this condition.\n\nFor $c=1$:\n-   $a = 3 \\times 1 = 3$\n-   $b = 6 \\times 1 = 6$\n-   $c = 1$\n-   $d = 3 \\times 1 = 3$\n\nThe corrected stoichiometric coefficients are $a=3$, $b=6$, $c=1$, and $d=3$. The balanced reaction is:\n$$3\\,\\mathrm{CO_2} + 6\\,\\mathrm{H_2} \\longrightarrow 1\\,\\mathrm{C_3H_6O_3} + 3\\,\\mathrm{H_2O}$$\n\nThe problem requires reporting the coefficient vector in the species order $(\\mathrm{CO_2},\\,\\mathrm{H_2},\\,\\mathrm{C_3H_6O_3},\\,\\mathrm{H_2O})$, which corresponds to $(a, b, c, d)$.
