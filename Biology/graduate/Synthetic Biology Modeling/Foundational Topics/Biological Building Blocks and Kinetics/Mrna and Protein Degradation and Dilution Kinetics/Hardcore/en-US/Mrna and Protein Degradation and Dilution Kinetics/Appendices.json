The derivation must begin from the principle of mass conservation at the level of the number of protein molecules, $N(t)$.\n\nLet $N(t)$ be the total number of protein molecules in the cell at time $t$, and let $V(t)$ be the cell volume at time $t$. The concentration of the protein is defined as:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{N(t)}{V(t)} $$\n\nThe rate of change of the number of molecules, $\\frac{dN}{dt}$, is governed by the balance between production and loss.\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Production}) - (\\text{Rate of Loss}) $$\n\nThe problem states that the volumetric production rate is a constant, $\\alpha$.
