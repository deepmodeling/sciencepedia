            "problem": "In a simplified model of a cellular signal transduction pathway, an inactive protein species $A$ is converted to its active form $A^*$ upon binding of a signaling molecule (ligand) $L$. This activation process is opposed by a deactivation mechanism that spontaneously reverts $A^*$ back to $A$. The concentration of the active protein, denoted $[A^*]$, is governed by the following rate equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{d[A^*]}{dt} = k_{on} [L] [A] - k_{off}[A^*] $$\n\nHere, $[X]$ represents the concentration of species $X$, $t$ is time, $k_{on}$ is the second-order rate constant for the activation process, and $k_{off}$ is the first-order rate constant for the deactivation process.\n\nThe total concentration of the protein, $[A]_{total} = [A] + [A^*]$, is constant. For the purpose of this analysis, assume that the concentration of the ligand $[L]$ is also constant and equal to $L_0$.\n\nBy appropriately nondimensionalizing the system, the governing differential equation can be rewritten in a form that depends on a single dimensionless parameter, which we will call $\\Pi$. This parameter encapsulates the relative strengths of the activation and deactivation processes. Determine the analytical expression for this dimensionless parameter $\\Pi$ in terms of the original physical parameters of the system.",
            "solution": "The goal is to nondimensionalize the given differential equation and identify the single resulting dimensionless parameter.\n\n**Step 1: State the governing equation and constraints**\nThe rate of change of the active protein concentration $[A^*]$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d[A^*]}{dt} = k_{on} [L] [A] - k_{off}[A^*] $$\nWe are given that the total protein concentration is constant, $[A]_{total} = [A] + [A^*]$. We can use this to eliminate $[A]$ from the equation:\n$$ [A] = [A]_{total} - [A^*] $$\nSubstituting this into the rate equation, and using $[L] = L_0$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d[A^*]}{dt} = k_{on} L_0 ([A]_{total} - [A^*]) - k_{off}[A^*] $$\n\n**Step 2: Define dimensionless variables**\nWe introduce dimensionless variables for concentration and time. Let $a^*$ be the dimensionless concentration of the active protein, and $\\tau$ be dimensionless time. We define them as follows:\n$$ a^* = \\frac{[A^*]}{A_c} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tau = \\frac{t}{t_c} $$\nwhere $A_c$ is a characteristic concentration and $t_c$ is a characteristic time. From these definitions, we can write the original variables in terms of the dimensionless ones:\n$$ [A^*] = A_c a^* \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = t_c \\tau $$\n\n**Step 3: Transform the derivative term**\nWe need to express the derivative $\\frac{d[A^*]}{dt}$ in terms of the new variables. Using the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{d[A^*]}{dt} = \\frac{d(A_c a^*)}{dt} = A_c \\frac{da^*}{dt} = A_c \\frac{da^*}{d\\tau} \\frac{d\\tau}{dt} $$\nSince $\\tau = t/t_c$, we have $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = \\frac{1}{t_c}$. Therefore,\n$$ \\frac{d[A^*]}{dt} = \\frac{A_c}{t_c} \\frac{da^*}{d\\tau} $$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute into the governing equation**\nNow we substitute the dimensionless variables and the transformed derivative into the ODE from Step 1:\n$$ \\frac{A_c}{t_c} \\frac{da^*}{d\\tau} = k_{on} L_0 ([A]_{total} - A_c a^*) - k_{off} (A_c a^*) $$\n\n**Step 5: Choose characteristic scales to simplify the equation**\nTo obtain the simplest dimensionless form, we must choose appropriate characteristic scales $A_c$ and $t_c$. A natural choice for the characteristic concentration is the total protein concentration, so we set:\n$$ A_c = [A]_{total} $$\nSubstituting this into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{[A]_{total}}{t_c} \\frac{da^*}{d\\tau} = k_{on} L_0 ([A]_{total} - [A]_{total} a^*) - k_{off} ([A]_{total} a^*) $$\nWe can divide the entire equation by $[A]_{total}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{t_c} \\frac{da^*}{d\\tau} = k_{on} L_0 (1 - a^*) - k_{off} a^* $$\nNow, we must choose a characteristic time $t_c$. A natural timescale in this system is the inverse of the deactivation rate constant, which represents the characteristic lifetime of the active state. Let's choose:\n$$ t_c = \\frac{1}{k_{off}} $$\nSubstituting this choice for $t_c$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{(1/k_{off})} \\frac{da^*}{d\\tau} = k_{on} L_0 (1 - a^*) - k_{off} a^* $$\n$$ k_{off} \\frac{da^*}{d\\tau} = k_{on} L_0 (1 - a^*) - k_{off} a^* $$\n\n**Step 6: Isolate the dimensionless form and identify the parameter $\\Pi$**\nTo get the final dimensionless form, we divide the entire equation by $k_{off}$:\n$$ \\frac{da^*}{d\\tau} = \\frac{k_{on} L_0}{k_{off}} (1 - a^*) - a^* $$\nThis equation describes the dynamics of the dimensionless concentration $a^*$ with respect to dimensionless time $\\tau$. The equation contains only one parameter, which is the coefficient of the $(1-a^*)$ term. This is our desired dimensionless parameter $\\Pi$.\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{k_{on} L_0}{k_{off}} $$\nTo confirm, let's check the dimensions. Let $C$ be the dimension of concentration and $T$ be the dimension of time.\nFrom the original equation, the term $k_{off}[A^*]$ must have dimensions of $C/T$. So, $[k_{off}] = T^{-1}$.\nThe term $k_{on}[L][A]$ must also have dimensions of $C/T$. So, $[k_{on}] \\cdot C \\cdot C = C/T$, which means $[k_{on}] = C^{-1}T^{-1}$.\nThe dimensions of our parameter $\\Pi$ are:\n$$ [\\Pi] = \\frac{[k_{on}] [L_0]}{[k_{off}]} = \\frac{(C^{-1}T^{-1}) \\cdot C}{T^{-1}} = \\frac{T^{-1}}{T^{-1}} = 1 $$\nThe parameter is indeed dimensionless. It represents the ratio of the maximum activation rate ($k_{on} L_0 [A]_{total}$) to the maximum deactivation rate ($k_{off} [A]_{total}$).",
