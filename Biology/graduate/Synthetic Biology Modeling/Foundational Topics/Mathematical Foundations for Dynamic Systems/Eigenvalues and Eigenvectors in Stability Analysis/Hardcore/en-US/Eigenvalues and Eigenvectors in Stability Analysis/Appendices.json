            "solution": "The stability of the steady state of the linearized system $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = J \\mathbf{x}$ is determined by the signs of the real parts of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$. The system is locally asymptotically stable if and only if all eigenvalues have strictly negative real parts.

For the third condition to hold, it must also be that $a_{0}  0$. If $a_{2}0$ and $a_{0}0$, the condition $a_{1}a_{2}  a_{0}$ implies that $a_{1}$ must also be positive. Therefore, these three interconnected inequalities ensure that all coefficients ($a_{2}$, $a_{1}$, $a_{0}$) are positive and that the crucial additional constraint $a_{1}a_{2}  a_{0}$ is met.\n\nThe problem requires the expressions for the three Routh-Hurwitz determinants $\\Delta_{1}$, $\\Delta_{2}$, and $\\Delta_{3}$ in symbolic form.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two quantities related to the stability analysis of a perturbed linear system. First, the condition number of the eigenvector matrix of the given Jacobian $J$.

Use this result to find the upper bound on the shift in eigenvalues of $J$ under a perturbation $\\mathbf{E}$ with a given norm bound $||\\mathbf{E}||_2 = 0.05 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we diagonalize the matrix $J$ by finding its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The diagonalization is of the form $J = V \\Lambda V^{-1}$, where $\\Lambda$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and $V$ is the matrix whose columns are the corresponding eigenvectors.\n\nThe eigenvalues, $\\lambda$, are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J - \\lambda I) = 0$.

The component $v_{11}$ is arbitrary. We can choose $v_{11}=1$. Thus, the first eigenvector is $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor $\\lambda_2 = -2$:\n$$\n(J - \\lambda_2 I)\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 - (-2)  5 \\\\ 0  -2 - (-2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{21} \\\\ v_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  5 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{21} \\\\ v_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields the equation $v_{21} + 5v_{22} = 0$. We can choose $v_{22}=-1$, which implies $v_{21}=5$.

We first compute the inverse of $V$:\n$$\nV^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(V)} \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -5 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{(1)(-1) - (5)(0)} \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -5 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  5 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe observe that $V = V^{-1}$, meaning $V$ is an involutory matrix.\n\nThe condition number is thus $\\kappa_2(V) = ||V||_2 ||V||_2 = (||V||_2)^2$. The matrix $2$-norm $||V||_2$ is its largest singular value, $\\sigma_{\\max}(V)$, which is given by $\\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\max}(V^T V)}$, where $\\lambda_{\\max}(V^T V)$ is the largest eigenvalue of $V^T V$.\nFirst, we compute $V^T V$:\n$$\nV^T V = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 5  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  5 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  5 \\\\ 5  26 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\mu$ of $V^T V$ are the roots of $\\det(V^T V - \\mu I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\mu  5 \\\\ 5  26-\\mu \\end{pmatrix} = (1-\\mu)(26-\\mu) - 25 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\mu^2 - 27\\mu + 26 - 25 = 0 \\implies \\mu^2 - 27\\mu + 1 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, the eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{27 \\pm \\sqrt{(-27)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{27 \\pm \\sqrt{729 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{27 \\pm \\sqrt{725}}{2}\n$$\nSince $\\sqrt{725} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 29} = 5\\sqrt{29}$, the eigenvalues are $\\mu = \\frac{27 \\pm 5\\sqrt{29}}{2}$.\nThe largest eigenvalue is $\\mu_{\\max} = \\frac{27 + 5\\sqrt{29}}{2}$.\nThe condition number is $\\kappa_2(V) = (||V||_2)^2 = (\\sigma_{\\max}(V))^2 = \\lambda_{\\max}(V^T V) = \\mu_{\\max}$.\nAn alternative way to calculate $\\kappa_2(V)$ is $\\sigma_{\\max}(V) / \\sigma_{\\min}(V)$. Since $|\\det(V)| = |-1|=1$, we have $\\sigma_{\\max}\\sigma_{\\min}=1$, so $\\sigma_{\\min} = 1/\\sigma_{\\max}$. Then $\\kappa_2(V) = \\sigma_{\\max} / (1/\\sigma_{\\max}) = \\sigma_{\\max}^2$, confirming our previous finding.\nSo, the exact condition number is:\n$$\n\\kappa_2(V) = \\frac{27 + 5\\sqrt{29}}{2}\n$$\nNumerically, this is $\\kappa_2(V) \\approx \\frac{27 + 5(5.38516)}{2} \\approx \\frac{27 + 26.9258}{2} \\approx 26.9629$.\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\kappa_2(V) \\approx 26.96$.\n\nNow we address the second part of the problem. We need to predict the upper bound on the eigenvalue deviation. The \"well-tested perturbation theory fact\" for a diagonalizable matrix $J=V\\Lambda V^{-1}$ is the Bauer-Fike theorem. It states that for any eigenvalue $\\mu$ of the perturbed matrix $J+\\mathbf{E}$, there exists an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $J$ such that:\n$$\n|\\mu - \\lambda| \\le \\kappa_p(V) ||\\mathbf{E}||_p\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa_p(V)$ is the condition number of $V$ in the matrix $p$-norm. The problem specifies the $2$-norm. Thus, the maximum possible deviation of any eigenvalue, which we denote $\\delta_{\\max}$, is bounded by:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\max} \\le \\kappa_2(V) ||\\mathbf{E}||_2\n$$\nWe are given the bound on the perturbation's norm, $||\\mathbf{E}||_2 = 0.05 \\text{ s}^{-1}$. Using the calculated value for $\\kappa_2(V)$, we find the upper bound for the deviation:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\max} = \\kappa_2(V) \\times ||\\mathbf{E}||_2 = \\left( \\frac{27 + 5\\sqrt{29}}{2} \\right) \\times 0.05 \\text{ s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_{\\max} \\approx 26.9629 \\times 0.05 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\approx 1.348145 \\text{ s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the upper bound on the eigenvalue deviation is $1.348 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\nThis result is significant. The initial eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$ imply a stable system. However, a small perturbation with norm $0.05$ can cause a large change in the eigenvalues, up to $\\approx 1.348$. For instance, the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = -1$ could be shifted into the right-half complex plane (e.g., to $-1 + 1.348 = 0.348$), which would render the steady state unstable. This high sensitivity to perturbation is a hallmark of non-normal systems, characterized by a large condition number $\\kappa_2(V) \\gg 1$.\n\nThe two requested numerical values are the condition number and the eigenvalue deviation bound.\n$\\kappa_2(V) \\approx 26.96$.\n$\\delta_{\\max} = 1.348 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\nThe problem requests the final answer for the eigenvalue deviation bound.\n\nFinal calculations to ensure four significant figures:\n$\\kappa_2(V) = 26.962912... \\rightarrow 26.96$.\n$\\delta_{\\max} = 26.962912... \\times 0.05 = 1.3481456... \\rightarrow 1.348$.\n\nThe problem asks to compute $\\kappa_2(V)$ and then provide the prediction for the bound. We will provide both values rounded as requested.\nCondition number: $\\kappa_2(V) \\approx 26.96$.\nEigenvalue deviation bound: $\\delta_{\\max} \\approx 1.348 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.",
