            "solution": "The problem statement is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and provides all necessary information to proceed with a solution. The task involves applying the Gershgorin circle theorem to a given Jacobian matrix to determine a bound on its eigenvalues, which is a standard procedure in the stability analysis of dynamical systems.\n\nThe stability of the steady state of the system $\\frac{d}{dt}\\,\\delta \\mathbf{x}(t) = J \\,\\delta \\mathbf{x}(t)$ is determined by the real parts of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$. If all eigenvalues have negative real parts, the steady state is stable. If any eigenvalue has a positive real part, it is unstable. The Gershgorin circle theorem provides a convenient method for estimating the location of eigenvalues in the complex plane.\n\nThe first task is to state the Gershgorin circle theorem and explain its rigor.\nLet $A$ be a general $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $a_{ij} \\in \\mathbb{C}$. For each row $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$, we define a closed disk in the complex plane, known as a Gershgorin disk, $D_i$. The center of this disk is the diagonal entry $a_{ii}$, and its radius, $R_i$, is the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal entries in that row:\n$$R_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} |a_{ij}|$$\nThe disk $D_i$ is thus the set of all complex numbers $z$ such that $|z - a_{ii}| \\le R_i$. The Gershgorin circle theorem states that every eigenvalue of the matrix $A$ is located within the union of these $n$ disks:\n$$\\sigma(A) \\subseteq \\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} D_i$$\nwhere $\\sigma(A)$ is the spectrum (the set of all eigenvalues) of $A$.\n\nThe theorem provides a rigorous enclosure because its proof is based on a direct argument from the definition of an eigenvalue. Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $A$ with a corresponding non-zero eigenvector $\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n)^T$. By definition, $A\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}$. Let $k$ be an index for which the component of the eigenvector has the largest magnitude, i.e., $|v_k| \\ge |v_j|$ for all $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. Since $\\mathbf{v}$ is a non-zero vector, we must have $|v_k|  0$. The $k$-th row of the equation $A\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}$ is:\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{kj} v_j = \\lambda v_k$$\nRearranging this equation to isolate the term with $a_{kk}$ gives:\n$$(\\lambda - a_{kk}) v_k = \\sum_{j \\neq k} a_{kj} v_j$$\nTaking the absolute value of both sides and applying the triangle inequality yields:\n$$|\\lambda - a_{kk}| |v_k| = \\left| \\sum_{j \\neq k} a_{kj} v_j \\right| \\le \\sum_{j \\neq k} |a_{kj}| |v_j|$$\nBy our choice of $k$, we know that $|v_j| \\le |v_k|$ for all $j$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\\sum_{j \\neq k} |a_{kj}| |v_j| \\le \\sum_{j \\neq k} |a_{kj}| |v_k| = |v_k| \\left( \\sum_{j \\neq k} |a_{kj}| \\right) = |v_k| R_k$$\nCombining the inequalities, we have:\n$$|\\lambda - a_{kk}| |v_k| \\le |v_k| R_k$$\nSince $|v_k|  0$, we can divide by it to obtain:\n$$|\\lambda - a_{kk}| \\le R_k$$\nThis inequality demonstrates that the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ must lie within the Gershgorin disk $D_k$. As this holds for any arbitrary eigenvalue $\\lambda$, all eigenvalues of $A$ must lie in the union of all $n$ Gershgorin disks. This completes the explanation of the theorem's rigor.\n\nThe second task is to apply this theorem to the given Jacobian matrix $J$:\n$$\nJ \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-0.32  -1.10  0.00 \\\\\n0.90  -0.45  -0.80 \\\\\n0.00  1.20  -0.50\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe construct the three Gershgorin disks, $D_1$, $D_2$, and $D_3$, corresponding to the three rows of $J$.\n\nFor the first row ($i=1$):\nThe center is the diagonal element $c_1 = J_{11} = -0.32$.\nThe radius is the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements $R_1 = |J_{12}| + |J_{13}| = |-1.10| + |0.00| = 1.10$.\nSo, the first disk is $D_1 = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\,:\\, |z - (-0.32)| \\le 1.10 \\}$.\n\nFor the second row ($i=2$):\nThe center is $c_2 = J_{22} = -0.45$.\nThe radius is $R_2 = |J_{21}| + |J_{23}| = |0.90| + |-0.80| = 0.90 + 0.80 = 1.70$.\nSo, the second disk is $D_2 = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\,:\\, |z - (-0.45)| \\le 1.70 \\}$.\n\nFor the third row ($i=3$):\nThe center is $c_3 = J_{33} = -0.50$.\nThe radius is $R_3 = |J_{31}| + |J_{32}| = |0.00| + |1.20| = 1.20$.\nSo, the third disk is $D_3 = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\,:\\, |z - (-0.50)| \\le 1.20 \\}$.\n\nThe theorem guarantees that all eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $J$ lie in the union $D_1 \\cup D_2 \\cup D_3$. We need to find the tightest rigorous upper bound on the real part of any eigenvalue, $\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda)$. An arbitrary point $z$ in a disk with a real center $c$ and radius $R$ has a real part $\\mathrm{Re}(z)$ that is bounded by $c-R \\le \\mathrm{Re}(z) \\le c+R$. The maximum possible real part for any point in the disk is therefore $c+R$. We calculate this for each disk:\nFor $D_1$: Maximum $\\mathrm{Re}(z)$ is $c_1 + R_1 = -0.32 + 1.10 = 0.78$.\nFor $D_2$: Maximum $\\mathrm{Re}(z)$ is $c_2 + R_2 = -0.45 + 1.70 = 1.25$.\nFor $D_3$: Maximum $\\mathrm{Re}(z)$ is $c_3 + R_3 = -0.50 + 1.20 = 0.70$.\n\nSince any eigenvalue $\\lambda$ must reside in one of these disks, its real part cannot exceed the maximum of these three values.\n$$\\max_{\\lambda \\in \\sigma(J)} \\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda) \\le \\max(0.78, 1.25, 0.70) = 1.25$$\nThis value, $1.25$, is the tightest upper bound on the real part of any eigenvalue of $J$ that can be derived directly from the application of the Gershgorin circle theorem to the rows of the matrix. The problem asks for this bound to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $1.25$ has three significant figures. To express it with four, we append a zero, yielding $1.250$. The units of this bound are $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, consistent with the units of the entries of $J$.\nThis positive upper bound implies that the steady state could be unstable, as there could be an eigenvalue with a positive real part. The Gershgorin theorem does not-and cannot, in this case-rule out this possibility.",

We are asked to analyze the dynamics within the specific stoichiometric compatibility class defined by $T=1$, i.e., $x_1 + x_3 = 1$.\n\nFirst, we must find the unique positive equilibrium point $x^* = (x_1^*, x_2^*, x_3^*)$ in this class. At equilibrium, all time derivatives are zero:\n$1.$ $-x_1^* x_2^* + x_3^* = 0$\n$2.$ $1 - x_2^* - x_1^* x_2^* = 0$\n$3.$ $x_1^* x_2^* - x_3^* = 0$\nAnd the constraint for the class is:\n$4.$ $x_1^* + x_3^* = 1$\n\nFrom (1), we have $x_3^* = x_1^* x_2^*$. Substituting this into (2) gives $1 - x_2^* - x_3^* = 0$, or $x_3^* = 1 - x_2^*$.\nNow we have two expressions for $x_3^*$. Let's use the second one, $x_3^* = 1 - x_2^*$, and substitute it into (4):\n$x_1^* + (1 - x_2^*) = 1$, which simplifies to $x_1^* = x_2^*$.\n\nNow we substitute $x_2^* = x_1^*$ into the equation $x_3^* = x_1^* x_2^*$, which gives $x_3^* = (x_1^*)^2$.\nFinally, substitute this into the constraint (4):\n$x_1^* + (x_1^*)^2 = 1$, which can be rewritten as $(x_1^*)^2 + x_1^* - 1 = 0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $x_1^*$. Using the quadratic formula, $x_1^* = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\nSince concentrations must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$x_1^* = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$.\nThen, $x_2^* = x_1^* = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$.\nAnd $x_3^* = 1 - x_1^* = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\nAll three components are positive, so we have found the unique positive equilibrium $x^*$.\n\nTo assess stability within the class $x_1 + x_3 = 1$, we must analyze the dynamics restricted to this $2$-dimensional manifold. A direct way to do this is to eliminate one variable using the conservation law and study the resulting $2$-dimensional system. This corresponds to the method outlined in option D.\n\nLet's set $x_3 = 1 - x_1$. The dynamics for $x_1$ and $x_2$ are then described by a reduced system:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{dx_1}{dt} = -x_1 x_2 + (1 - x_1) = 1 - x_1 - x_1 x_2 \\\\\n\\frac{dx_2}{dt} = 1 - x_2 - x_1 x_2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe equilibrium for this reduced system is $(x_1^*, x_2^*) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\\right)$. Let's denote $\\phi_m = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we linearize this $2$D system by computing its Jacobian matrix, $J_{red}$, at the equilibrium point.\nLet $g(x_1, x_2) = (1 - x_1 - x_1 x_2, 1 - x_2 - x_1 x_2)^\\top$.\n$$\nJ_{red}(x_1, x_2) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial g_1}{\\partial x_1}  \\frac{\\partial g_1}{\\partial x_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g_2}{\\partial x_1}  \\frac{\\partial g_2}{\\partial x_2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 - x_2  -x_1 \\\\ -x_2  -1 - x_1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nEvaluating at the equilibrium $(x_1^*, x_2^*) = (\\phi_m, \\phi_m)$:\n$$\nJ_{red}(x_1^*, x_2^*) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 - \\phi_m  -\\phi_m \\\\ -\\phi_m  -1 - \\phi_m \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of this matrix determine the local stability. They are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J_{red} - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 - \\phi_m - \\lambda  -\\phi_m \\\\ -\\phi_m  -1 - \\phi_m - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(-1 - \\phi_m - \\lambda)^2 - (-\\phi_m)^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n((1 + \\phi_m) + \\lambda)^2 - \\phi_m^2 = 0\n$$\nThis is a difference of squares:\n$$\n(((1 + \\phi_m) + \\lambda) - \\phi_m) (((1 + \\phi_m) + \\lambda) + \\phi_m) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(1 + \\lambda)(1 + 2\\phi_m + \\lambda) = 0\n$$\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n$\\lambda_1 = -1$\n$\\lambda_2 = -1 - 2\\phi_m = -1 - 2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\\right) = -1 - (\\sqrt{5}-1) = -\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nBoth eigenvalues are real and negative ($\\lambda_1 = -1$, $\\lambda_2 = -\\sqrt{5} \\approx -2.236$). Therefore, the equilibrium point $x^*$ is locally asymptotically stable within the stoichiometric compatibility class $x_1 + x_3 = 1$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. Identify the conserved vector $l = [1,\\,0,\\,1]^\\top$ and select an orthonormal basis for the hyperplane $l^\\top x = \\text{const}$ and its tangent space. Projecting the linearized dynamics onto this basis gives the correct eigenvalues. The conclusion is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Compute the eigenvalues of the full $3 \\times 3$ Jacobian $J(x^*)$ and conclude that because one eigenvalue is $0$, $x^*$ is not asymptotically stable.\nThe full system has a conservation law, which guarantees that the Jacobian $J(x^*)$ has an eigenvalue of $0$. The full set of eigenvalues is $\\{0, -1, -\\sqrt{5}\\}$. The presence of the zero eigenvalue implies that the equilibrium is not asymptotically stable in the full $3$-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. However, the question specifically asks for an assessment of stability *within the class* $x_1 + x_3 = 1$. This method fails to address the actual question posed. The dynamics within the invariant manifold are governed by the non-zero eigenvalues. This approach is therefore inappropriate for the stated task.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Project the linearization at $x^*$ onto the right nullspace of $J(x^*)$ and use the resulting one-dimensional reduced model to decide stability; the zero eigenvalue in this projection indicates neutral stability within the class.\nThis is conceptually flawed. The right nullspace of $J(x^*)$ corresponds to the eigenvector for the $\\lambda=0$ eigenvalue. This direction points along the manifold of equilibria, tangent to a path of changing the conserved quantity $T$. To analyze stability *within* a class (fixed $T$), one must examine the dynamics in directions *transverse* to this nullspace vector, within the tangent space of the constant-$T$ manifold. Projecting onto the nullspace collapses the relevant dynamics and provides no information about stability within the class. The relevant space for the reduced model is the $2$-dimensional tangent space of the manifold, not the $1$-dimensional nullspace.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Eliminate the conserved variable using $x_3 = 1 - x_1$ and form the two-dimensional reduced ODE in $(x_1, x_2)$. Linearize this reduced ODE at the corresponding $(x_1^*, x_2^*)$ and find two eigenvalues equal to approximately $-1$ and $-\\sqrt{5}$, concluding that $x^*$ is locally asymptotically stable within the class $x_1 + x_3 = 1$.\nThis option describes precisely the method of variable elimination, which is a standard and correct way to restrict the dynamics to the invariant manifold. The subsequent linearization and eigenvalue calculation are also standard. My derivation above followed this exact procedure and confirmed the eigenvalues are indeed $-1$ and $-\\sqrt{5}$, leading to the correct conclusion of local asymptotic stability.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. Choose any full column-rank basis of the hyperplane $x_1 + x_3 = 1$ (not necessarily orthonormal), compute the matrix product formed by transposing this basis, multiplying by $J(x^*)$, and then multiplying by the same basis again, and assert that the eigenvalues of this product are invariant to the choice of basis; if these eigenvalues have negative real parts, $x^*$ is locally asymptotically stable.\nThis option describes an incorrect procedure for a general (non-orthonormal) basis $N$ of the tangent space. The matrix that governs the reduced dynamics is related to $J$ by a similarity transformation, which is not $N^\\top J N$ in general. Furthermore, the eigenvalues of $N^\\top J N$ are not invariant to the choice of non-orthonormal basis $N$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBoth options A and D describe valid and theoretically sound methods for performing the required stability analysis, and both state the correct numerical results and conclusion.",

Thus, the first eigenvector is $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor $\\lambda_2 = -2$:\n$$\n(J - \\lambda_2 I)\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 - (-2)  5 \\\\ 0  -2 - (-2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{21} \\\\ v_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  5 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{21} \\\\ v_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields the equation $v_{21} + 5v_{22} = 0$. We can choose $v_{22}=-1$, which implies $v_{21}=5$. Thus, the second eigenvector is $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe matrix of eigenvectors $V$ is formed by using these eigenvectors as columns:\n$$\nV = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{v}_1  \\mathbf{v}_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  5 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe condition number $\\kappa_2(V)$ is defined as $\\kappa_2(V) = ||V||_2 ||V^{-1}||_2$. We first compute the inverse of $V$:\n$$\nV^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(V)} \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -5 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{(1)(-1) - (5)(0)} \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -5 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  5 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe observe that $V = V^{-1}$, meaning $V$ is an involutory matrix.\n\nThe condition number is thus $\\kappa_2(V) = ||V||_2 ||V||_2 = (||V||_2)^2$. The matrix $2$-norm $||V||_2$ is its largest singular value, $\\sigma_{\\max}(V)$, which is given by $\\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\max}(V^T V)}$, where $\\lambda_{\\max}(V^T V)$ is the largest eigenvalue of $V^T V$.\nFirst, we compute $V^T V$:\n$$\nV^T V = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 5  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  5 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  5 \\\\ 5  26 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\mu$ of $V^T V$ are the roots of $\\det(V^T V - \\mu I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\mu  5 \\\\ 5  26-\\mu \\end{pmatrix} = (1-\\mu)(26-\\mu) - 25 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\mu^2 - 27\\mu + 26 - 25 = 0 \\implies \\mu^2 - 27\\mu + 1 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, the eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{27 \\pm \\sqrt{(-27)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{27 \\pm \\sqrt{729 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{27 \\pm \\sqrt{725}}{2}\n$$\nSince $\\sqrt{725} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 29} = 5\\sqrt{29}$, the eigenvalues are $\\mu = \\frac{27 \\pm 5\\sqrt{29}}{2}$.\nThe largest eigenvalue is $\\mu_{\\max} = \\frac{27 + 5\\sqrt{29}}{2}$.\nThe condition number is $\\kappa_2(V) = (||V||_2)^2 = (\\sigma_{\\max}(V))^2 = \\lambda_{\\max}(V^T V) = \\mu_{\\max}$.\nAn alternative way to calculate $\\kappa_2(V)$ is $\\sigma_{\\max}(V) / \\sigma_{\\min}(V)$. Since $|\\det(V)| = |-1|=1$, we have $\\sigma_{\\max}\\sigma_{\\min}=1$, so $\\sigma_{\\min} = 1/\\sigma_{\\max}$. Then $\\kappa_2(V) = \\sigma_{\\max} / (1/\\sigma_{\\max}) = \\sigma_{\\max}^2$, confirming our previous finding.\nSo, the exact condition number is:\n$$\n\\kappa_2(V) = \\frac{27 + 5\\sqrt{29}}{2}\n$$\nNumerically, this is $\\kappa_2(V) \\approx \\frac{27 + 5(5.38516)}{2} \\approx \\frac{27 + 26.9258}{2} \\approx 26.9629$.\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\kappa_2(V) \\approx 26.96$.\n\nNow we address the second part of the problem. We need to predict the upper bound on the eigenvalue deviation. The \"well-tested perturbation theory fact\" for a diagonalizable matrix $J=V\\Lambda V^{-1}$ is the Bauer-Fike theorem. It states that for any eigenvalue $\\mu$ of the perturbed matrix $J+\\mathbf{E}$, there exists an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $J$ such that:\n$$\n|\\mu - \\lambda| \\le \\kappa_p(V) ||\\mathbf{E}||_p\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa_p(V)$ is the condition number of $V$ in the matrix $p$-norm. The problem specifies the $2$-norm. Thus, the maximum possible deviation of any eigenvalue, which we denote $\\delta_{\\max}$, is bounded by:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\max} \\le \\kappa_2(V) ||\\mathbf{E}||_2\n$$\nWe are given the bound on the perturbation's norm, $||\\mathbf{E}||_2 = 0.05 \\text{ s}^{-1}$. Using the calculated value for $\\kappa_2(V)$, we find the upper bound for the deviation:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\max} = \\kappa_2(V) \\times ||\\mathbf{E}||_2 = \\left( \\frac{27 + 5\\sqrt{29}}{2} \\right) \\times 0.05 \\text{ s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_{\\max} \\approx 26.9629 \\times 0.05 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\approx 1.348145 \\text{ s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the upper bound on the eigenvalue deviation is $1.348 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\nThis result is significant. The initial eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$ imply a stable system. However, a small perturbation with norm $0.05$ can cause a large change in the eigenvalues, up to $\\approx 1.348$. For instance, the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = -1$ could be shifted into the right-half complex plane (e.g., to $-1 + 1.348 = 0.348$), which would render the steady state unstable. This high sensitivity to perturbation is a hallmark of non-normal systems, characterized by a large condition number $\\kappa_2(V) \\gg 1$.\n\nThe two requested numerical values are the condition number and the eigenvalue deviation bound.\n$\\kappa_2(V) \\approx 26.96$.\n$\\delta_{\\max} = 1.348 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\nThe problem requests the final answer for the eigenvalue deviation bound.\n\nFinal calculations to ensure four significant figures:\n$\\kappa_2(V) = 26.962912... \\rightarrow 26.96$.\n$\\delta_{\\max} = 26.962912... \\times 0.05 = 1.3481456... \\rightarrow 1.348$.\n\nThe problem asks to compute $\\kappa_2(V)$ and then provide the prediction for the bound. We will provide both values rounded as requested.\nCondition number: $\\kappa_2(V) \\approx 26.96$.\nEigenvalue deviation bound: $\\delta_{\\max} \\approx 1.348 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.",
