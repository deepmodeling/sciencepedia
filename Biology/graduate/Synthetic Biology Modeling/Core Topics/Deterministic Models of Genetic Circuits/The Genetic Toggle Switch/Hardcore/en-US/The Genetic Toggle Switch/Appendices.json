            "problem": "A foundational circuit in synthetic biology is the genetic toggle switch, which exhibits bistable behavior. This circuit is constructed from two genes that mutually repress each other. Consider a system with two such genes, Gene 1 and Gene 2.\n\n- Gene 1 codes for Repressor 1, whose concentration is denoted by $u$.\n- Gene 2 codes for Repressor 2, whose concentration is denoted by $v$.\n- The expression of Gene 1 is repressed by Repressor 2.\n- The expression of Gene 2 is repressed by Repressor 1.\n\nThe dynamics of this system can be modeled with a pair of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).

            "introduction": "One of the most powerful features of the genetic toggle switch is its capacity for bistability, which allows the circuit to act as a cellular memory element. This property gives rise to hysteresis, where the system's response to an input depends on its previous state.

            "problem": "A synthetic biology research team is characterizing a genetic toggle switch circuit they have engineered into a bacterial strain. This circuit features two mutually repressive genes, and its state can be controlled by an external chemical inducer. The concentration of a fluorescent protein, designated as protein X, serves as the output signal for the circuit's state.\n\nAfter extensive measurements, the team establishes a mathematical model that accurately relates the steady-state concentration of protein X, denoted by $p$ (in units of nanomolar, nM), to the concentration of the inducer, denoted by $c$ (in units of micromolar, $\\mu$M). For positive protein concentrations ($p > 0$), this relationship is given by the equation:\n$$c = \\frac{1}{3} p^3 - 2 p^2 + 3 p + 1$$\n\nThe system exhibits hysteresis, a hallmark of a bistable switch. When the inducer concentration $c$ is slowly increased from zero, the protein concentration $p$ follows a path to a single, stable low-expression state. As $c$ continues to increase, it reaches an upper critical threshold, at which point the system abruptly jumps to a stable high-expression state. Conversely, when the inducer concentration is slowly decreased from a very high value, the system remains in the high-expression state until it reaches a lower critical threshold, causing an abrupt switch back to the low-expression state. The range of inducer concentrations between these two thresholds defines the bistable region, where the system can exist in either the low- or high-expression state depending on its history.\n\nDetermine the values of the lower and upper critical inducer concentrations that form the boundaries of this bistable region. Express your answers for the lower and upper critical concentrations, in that order, in units of $\\mu$M. Round your final answers to four significant figures.",

This is a standard and scientifically sound model.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

Determination of the parameter $\\alpha$**\n\nAt a fixed point $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$, the time derivatives are zero: $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$. This yields the steady-state equations:\n$$ x^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (y^{\\ast})^{n}} $$\n$$ y^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (x^{\\ast})^{n}} $$\nThe problem specifies a symmetric fixed point, where $x^{\\ast} = y^{\\ast} = s$. Substituting this into either of the steady-state equations gives the algebraic condition that $s$ must satisfy:\n$$ s = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + s^{n}} $$\nWe are given $n=2$ and $s=\\frac{1}{2}$. We can solve for the specific value of $\\alpha$ that supports this fixed point:\n$$ \\alpha = s(1 + s^{n}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right) = \\frac{5}{8} $$\nThus, the parameter value is $\\alpha = \\frac{5}{8}$.\n\n**2. Construction of the Jacobian Matrix $J$**\n\nThe vector field for the system is $\\mathbf{F}(x,y) = (f(x,y), g(x,y))$, where:\n$$ f(x,y) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + y^{n}} - x $$\n$$ g(x,y) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + x^{n}} - y $$\nThe Jacobian matrix $J$ is defined as:\n$$ J(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\alpha (1+y^{n})^{-1} \\right) = -\\alpha (1+y^{n})^{-2} (ny^{n-1}) = -\\frac{n\\alpha y^{n-1}}{(1+y^{n})^{2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\alpha (1+x^{n})^{-1} \\right) = -\\alpha (1+x^{n})^{-2} (nx^{n-1}) = -\\frac{n\\alpha x^{n-1}}{(1+x^{n})^{2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -1 $$\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at the fixed point $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast}) = (s,s) = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$ with $n=2$ and $\\alpha=\\frac{5}{8}$. The off-diagonal terms are equal due to symmetry. Let's calculate their value:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{(s,s)} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{(s,s)} = -\\frac{2 \\left(\\frac{5}{8}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2-1}}{\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right)^{2}} = -\\frac{\\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}{\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2}} = -\\frac{\\frac{5}{8}}{\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^{2}} = -\\frac{\\frac{5}{8}}{\\frac{25}{16}} = -\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{16}{25} = -\\frac{2}{5} $$\nThe Jacobian matrix at the fixed point $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$ is:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -\\frac{2}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{2}{5}  -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**3. Computation of Eigenvalues, Trace, and Determinant**\n\nThe trace of the Jacobian is the sum of its diagonal elements:\n$$ \\text{tr}(J) = -1 + (-1) = -2 $$\nThe determinant of the Jacobian is:\n$$ \\det(J) = (-1)(-1) - \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{4}{25} = \\frac{21}{25} $$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1-\\lambda  -\\frac{2}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{2}{5}  -1-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (-1-\\lambda)^{2} - \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^{2} = 0 $$\n$$ (\\lambda + 1)^{2} - \\frac{4}{25} = 0 $$\n$$ (\\lambda + 1)^{2} = \\frac{4}{25} $$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$ \\lambda + 1 = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{25}} = \\pm \\frac{2}{5} $$\nSolving for the two eigenvalues:\n$$ \\lambda_{1} = -1 - \\frac{2}{5} = -\\frac{5}{5} - \\frac{2}{5} = -\\frac{7}{5} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{2} = -1 + \\frac{2}{5} = -\\frac{5}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} = -\\frac{3}{5} $$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1} = -\\frac{7}{5}$ and $\\lambda_{2} = -\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n**4. Classification of the Fixed Point**\n\nThe problem provides the following classification rules:\n-   Stable node: $\\det(J)0$ and $\\text{tr}(J)0$.\n-   Unstable node: $\\det(J)0$ and $\\text{tr}(J)0$.\n-   Saddle: $\\det(J)0$.\n\nIn our case, we found $\\text{tr}(J)=-2  0$ and $\\det(J)=\\frac{21}{25}  0$. Therefore, the fixed point is a **stable node**.\nThe problem defines a stability code $\\sigma$ where $\\sigma=1$ for a stable node. Thus, $\\sigma=1$.\nThis is consistent with the fact that both eigenvalues are real and negative.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered triple of the two eigenvalues and the stability code: $(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}, \\sigma) = (-\\frac{7}{5}, -\\frac{3}{5}, 1)$.",
