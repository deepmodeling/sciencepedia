Validation using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes the Gardner-Collins toggle switch, a foundational model in synthetic biology. The equations represent protein concentration changes due to production (modeled by a repressive Hill function) and first-order degradation. This is a standard and scientifically sound model.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a system of ODEs and a specific fixed point, then asks for a standard linear stability analysis. The steps are clearly defined, and all necessary parameters ($n=2$, $s=1/2$) are provided to find a unique solution.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise mathematical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained.

Determination of the parameter $\\alpha$**\n\nAt a fixed point $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$, the time derivatives are zero: $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$. This yields the steady-state equations:\n$$ x^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (y^{\\ast})^{n}} $$\n$$ y^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (x^{\\ast})^{n}} $$\nThe problem specifies a symmetric fixed point, where $x^{\\ast} = y^{\\ast} = s$. Substituting this into either of the steady-state equations gives the algebraic condition that $s$ must satisfy:\n$$ s = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + s^{n}} $$\nWe are given $n=2$ and $s=\\frac{1}{2}$. We can solve for the specific value of $\\alpha$ that supports this fixed point:\n$$ \\alpha = s(1 + s^{n}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right) = \\frac{5}{8} $$\nThus, the parameter value is $\\alpha = \\frac{5}{8}$.\n\n**2. Construction of the Jacobian Matrix $J$**\n\nThe vector field for the system is $\\mathbf{F}(x,y) = (f(x,y), g(x,y))$, where:\n$$ f(x,y) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + y^{n}} - x $$\n$$ g(x,y) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + x^{n}} - y $$\nThe Jacobian matrix $J$ is defined as:\n$$ J(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\alpha (1+y^{n})^{-1} \\right) = -\\alpha (1+y^{n})^{-2} (ny^{n-1}) = -\\frac{n\\alpha y^{n-1}}{(1+y^{n})^{2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\alpha (1+x^{n})^{-1} \\right) = -\\alpha (1+x^{n})^{-2} (nx^{n-1}) = -\\frac{n\\alpha x^{n-1}}{(1+x^{n})^{2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -1 $$\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at the fixed point $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast}) = (s,s) = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$ with $n=2$ and $\\alpha=\\frac{5}{8}$. The off-diagonal terms are equal due to symmetry. Let's calculate their value:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{(s,s)} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{(s,s)} = -\\frac{2 \\left(\\frac{5}{8}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2-1}}{\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right)^{2}} = -\\frac{\\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}{\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2}} = -\\frac{\\frac{5}{8}}{\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^{2}} = -\\frac{\\frac{5}{8}}{\\frac{25}{16}} = -\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{16}{25} = -\\frac{2}{5} $$\nThe Jacobian matrix at the fixed point $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$ is:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{2}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{2}{5} & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**3. Computation of Eigenvalues, Trace, and Determinant**\n\nThe trace of the Jacobian is the sum of its diagonal elements:\n$$ \\text{tr}(J) = -1 + (-1) = -2 $$\nThe determinant of the Jacobian is:\n$$ \\det(J) = (-1)(-1) - \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{4}{25} = \\frac{21}{25} $$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1-\\lambda & -\\frac{2}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{2}{5} & -1-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (-1-\\lambda)^{2} - \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^{2} = 0 $$\n$$ (\\lambda + 1)^{2} - \\frac{4}{25} = 0 $$\n$$ (\\lambda + 1)^{2} = \\frac{4}{25} $$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$ \\lambda + 1 = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{25}} = \\pm \\frac{2}{5} $$\nSolving for the two eigenvalues:\n$$ \\lambda_{1} = -1 - \\frac{2}{5} = -\\frac{5}{5} - \\frac{2}{5} = -\\frac{7}{5} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{2} = -1 + \\frac{2}{5} = -\\frac{5}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} = -\\frac{3}{5} $$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1} = -\\frac{7}{5}$ and $\\lambda_{2} = -\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n**4. Classification of the Fixed Point**\n\nThe problem provides the following classification rules:\n-   Stable node: $\\det(J)>0$ and $\\text{tr}(J)<0$.\n-   Unstable node: $\\det(J)>0$ and $\\text{tr}(J)>0$.\n-   Saddle: $\\det(J)<0$.\n\nIn our case, we found $\\text{tr}(J)=-2 < 0$ and $\\det(J)=\\frac{21}{25} > 0$. Therefore, the fixed point is a **stable node**.\nThe problem defines a stability code $\\sigma$ where $\\sigma=1$ for a stable node. Thus, $\\sigma=1$.\nThis is consistent with the fact that both eigenvalues are real and negative.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered triple of the two eigenvalues and the stability code: $(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}, \\sigma) = (-\\frac{7}{5}, -\\frac{3}{5}, 1)$.",

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of biochemical kinetics and dynamical systems theory. The problem statement is self-contained, providing all necessary model equations, parameters, and numerical procedures to arrive at a unique, verifiable solution. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Design\n\nThe core task is to identify saddle-node bifurcations in the parameter space of a genetic toggle switch model. A saddle-node bifurcation marks the creation or annihilation of fixed points (steady states) as a parameter is varied. Locating these points requires solving a specific set of mathematical conditions.\n\n#### 1. The Mathematical Model\n\nThe system's dynamics are described by a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the dimensionless protein concentrations $x$ and $y$. The inducer concentration $I$ acts as a control parameter.\n\nThe rate of change for protein $x$ is given by its synthesis rate minus its degradation rate:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = f_1(x,y;I) = \\underbrace{\\frac{\\alpha_x}{1 + \\left(\\frac{y}{K_y^{\\mathrm{eff}}(I)}\\right)^{n}}}_{\\text{Synthesis of }x} - \\underbrace{\\delta_x x}_{\\text{Degradation of }x}\n$$\nThe synthesis of $x$ is repressed by protein $y$. The term is a Hill function, where $n$ is the Hill coefficient representing cooperativity. The inducer $I$ weakens this repression by increasing the effective repression threshold, $K_y^{\\mathrm{eff}}(I) = K_y \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{I}{K_I}\\right)^m\\right)$.\n\nSimilarly, the rate of change for protein $y$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = f_2(x,y;I) = \\underbrace{\\frac{\\alpha_y}{1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{K_x}\\right)^{n}}}_{\\text{Synthesis of }y} - \\underbrace{\\delta_y y}_{\\text{Degradation of }y}\n$$\nHere, the synthesis of $y$ is repressed by protein $x$ with a constant repression threshold $K_x$.\n\n#### 2. Fixed Points and Stability\n\nA fixed point, or steady state, of the system is a concentration pair $(x^\\ast, y^\\ast)$ where the rates of change are zero, i.e., $\\frac{dx}{dt}=0$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt}=0$. These points represent the long-term equilibrium behaviors of the toggle switch. They are found by solving the system of nonlinear algebraic equations:\n$$\nf_1(x^\\ast, y^\\ast; I) = 0\n$$\n$$\nf_2(x^\\ast, y^\\ast; I) = 0\n$$\nThe stability of a fixed point determines whether the system returns to it after a small perturbation. Stability is governed by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$ evaluated at the fixed point. The Jacobian matrix contains the partial derivatives of the rate functions:\n$$\nJ(x^\\ast, y^\\ast; I) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}_{(x^\\ast, y^\\ast)}\n$$\n\n#### 3. Saddle-Node Bifurcation Condition\n\nA saddle-node bifurcation occurs when a fixed point loses its stability in a particular way. At the bifurcation point $(x^\\ast, y^\\ast, I^\\ast)$, one eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix becomes zero. A necessary condition for this is that the determinant of the Jacobian is zero:\n$$\n\\det(J(x^\\ast, y^\\ast; I^\\ast)) = 0\n$$\nThis condition, combined with the two fixed-point equations, forms a system of three equations for the three unknowns $(x, y, I)$ that define the bifurcation point:\n$$\n(1) \\quad f_1(x,y;I) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(2) \\quad f_2(x,y;I) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(3) \\quad \\det(J(x,y;I)) = 0\n$$\nCalculating the partial derivatives and substituting the fixed-point conditions simplifies the determinant equation. A numerically robust, log-transformed version of this third equation is derived:\n$$\nf_3(x,y,I) = \\left( \\ln(\\alpha_x) + \\ln(\\alpha_y) + n\\ln(K_x) + n\\ln(K_y) + n\\ln\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{I}{K_I}\\right)^m\\right) \\right) - \\left( 2\\ln(n) + 2\\ln(\\delta_x) + 2\\ln(\\delta_y) + (n+1)\\ln(x) + (n+1)\\ln(y) \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis avoids potential floating-point overflow/underflow issues from high-power terms in the direct expression.\n\n#### 4. Numerical Algorithm Design\n\nWe will implement a numerical continuation and root-finding algorithm to locate the saddle-node bifurcations for each test case.\n\n**Step 1: Parameter Continuation and Fixed-Point Tracking**\nWe discretize the specified interval for the inducer concentration $I$ into a grid of sample points. For each value of $I$ in this grid, we solve the two-equation system $\\{f_1=0, f_2=0\\}$ to find all physically realistic fixed points $(x^\\ast \\ge 0, y^\\ast \\ge 0)$. Since multiple fixed points can exist (in a bistable regime), we use a grid of initial guesses for $(x, y)$ and a numerical root-finder (`scipy.optimize.root`) to discover all solutions. We collect the unique fixed points found at each $I$.\n\n**Step 2: Bifurcation Detection**\nWe iterate through the ordered grid of $I$ values, comparing the number of fixed points found at the current step, $I_k$, with the number found at the previous step, $I_{k-1}$. A change in the number of fixed points signals that a bifurcation has occurred within the interval $[I_{k-1}, I_k]$. This event provides a bracket for the bifurcation parameter $I^\\ast$ and candidate initial guesses for the state variables $(x^\\ast, y^\\ast)$.\n\n**Step 3: Bifurcation Point Refinement**\nWhen a bifurcation is detected in an interval $[I_{k-1}, I_k]$, we switch to solving the three-equation system $\\{f_1=0, f_2=0, f_3=0\\}$ for the unknowns $(x,y,I)$.\n- **Initial Guess**: The initial guess for the solver is critical. We use the fixed points found at $I_{k-1}$ and $I_k$ that are involved in the bifurcation as guesses for $(x,y)$. A good guess for $I$ is the midpoint of the interval, $(I_{k-1} + I_k)/2$.\n- **Solving**: We again use `scipy.optimize.root` to solve for $(x^\\ast, y^\\ast, I^\\ast)$.\n- **Validation**: We accept a solution if it converges successfully and the resulting $(x^\\ast, y^\\ast, I^\\ast)$ are physically valid (non-negative) and $I^\\ast$ lies within the simulation's overall range for $I$.\n\n**Step 4: Finalization**\nThe process is repeated for all detected changes in fixed-point counts across the entire range of $I$. The resulting list of found bifurcation inducer values, $I^\\ast$, is then filtered for uniqueness, sorted in ascending order, and rounded to the specified precision for each test case. This yields the final result.\n\nThis systematic approach combines parameter sweeping with targeted root-finding to precisely locate the saddle-node bifurcations where the system's qualitative behavior changes.",
