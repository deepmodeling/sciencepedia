In any population, new mutations continuously arise, while selection acts to remove deleterious ones. This exercise explores the dynamic equilibrium known as mutation-selection balance, a cornerstone of population genetics.

            "problem": "A microbial evolution experiment is conducted in a chemostat with a clonal, asexual, haploid population of Escherichia coli under a constant environment and constant population size. The effective population size ($N_e$) is maintained above $10^{9}$, so genetic drift is negligible. The wild-type strain is non-fluorescent. A loss-of-function mutation at a reporter locus generates a fluorescent phenotype that is deleterious in this environment. The mutation is one-way: forward mutation from wild-type to fluorescent occurs at a per-division rate $\\mu$, and reverse mutation from fluorescent to wild-type is negligible. Competition assays show that the fluorescent mutant has Wrightian fitness $1 - s$ relative to the wild type with fitness $1$, where $s \\in (0,1)$ is the selection coefficient against the mutant.\n\nDirect observation protocol: The per-division forward mutation rate $\\mu$ is measured by a fluctuation test, and the selection coefficient $s$ is measured by pairwise competition between wild type and fluorescent mutant in the same chemostat conditions. The population is then propagated for many generations, and the frequency $q_t$ of the fluorescent phenotype is tracked by flow cytometry each day. After a long time, the observed frequency approaches a stable plateau, consistent with a mutation–selection balance.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of Wrightian fitness for haploids, the action of selection as differential multiplication followed by normalization by mean fitness, and the introduction of new mutants by forward mutation at rate $\\mu$ from the wild-type class, derive the equilibrium condition for the deleterious-allele frequency under mutation–selection balance when reverse mutation is negligible.

The experimental context (chemostat, *E. coli*, fluctuation tests, competition assays) is standard methodology. The provided parameter values are physically and biologically realistic. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information provided to derive the requested equilibrium condition and compute the numerical result. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nProceeding to solution.\n\nLet $q_t$ be the frequency of the deleterious fluorescent allele at generation $t$, and $p_t$ be the frequency of the wild-type allele. By definition, $p_t + q_t = 1$. The Wrightian fitness of the wild-type is $w_{WT} = 1$, and the fitness of the fluorescent mutant is $w_{M} = 1-s$. The forward mutation rate from wild-type to mutant is $\\mu$. Reverse mutation is negligible.\n\nWe model the change in allele frequency over one generation by considering the sequential effects of mutation and selection.\n\nFirst, mutation occurs. A fraction $\\mu$ of the wild-type population mutates to the fluorescent type. The frequencies after mutation, denoted by a prime, are:\n$$q' = q_t + \\mu p_t = q_t + \\mu(1-q_t)$$\n$$p' = p_t - \\mu p_t = p_t(1-\\mu) = (1-q_t)(1-\\mu)$$\n\nNext, selection acts on these new frequencies. The contribution of each type to the next generation is proportional to its frequency multiplied by its fitness. The frequency of the fluorescent allele in the next generation, $q_{t+1}$, is the proportion of a *post-selection* fluorescent individuals in the total *post-selection* population.\n\nThe number of fluorescent individuals is proportional to $q'(1-s)$. The number of wild-type individuals is proportional to $p'(1)$. The mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, is the sum of these contributions, which normalizes the frequencies for the next generation.\n$$\\bar{w} = p'(1) + q'(1-s) = (1-q_t)(1-\\mu) + (q_t + \\mu(1-q_t))(1-s)$$\nThe frequency of the fluorescent allele at generation $t+1$ is then:\n$$q_{t+1} = \\frac{q'(1-s)}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{(q_t + \\mu(1-q_t))(1-s)}{(1-q_t)(1-\\mu) + (q_t + \\mu(1-q_t))(1-s)}$$\nThis is the full recurrence relation for the frequency of the mutant allele.\n\nAt equilibrium, the allele frequency is stable, meaning $q_{t+1} = q_t$.

We can therefore divide both sides by the term $(1-\\hat{q})$.\n$$\\hat{q}(1-\\mu) = (\\hat{q} + \\mu(1-\\hat{q}))(1-s)$$\n$$\\hat{q} - \\hat{q}\\mu = (\\hat{q} + \\mu - \\mu\\hat{q})(1-s)$$\n$$\\hat{q} - \\hat{q}\\mu = \\hat{q}(1-s) + \\mu(1-s) - \\mu\\hat{q}(1-s)$$\n$$\\hat{q} - \\hat{q}\\mu = \\hat{q} - \\hat{q}s + \\mu - \\mu s - \\mu\\hat{q} + \\mu\\hat{q}s$$\nCanceling identical terms ($\\hat{q}$ and $-\\hat{q}\\mu$) from both sides yields:\n$$0 = -\\hat{q}s + \\mu - \\mu s + \\mu\\hat{q}s$$\nWe rearrange to solve for $\\hat{q}$.\n$$\\hat{q}s - \\mu\\hat{q}s = \\mu - \\mu s$$\n$$\\hat{q}s(1-\\mu) = \\mu(1-s)$$\nThis gives the exact equilibrium condition for the deleterious-allele frequency under this model:\n$$\\hat{q} = \\frac{\\mu(1-s)}{s(1-\\mu)}$$\nIt is a common textbook approximation to state $\\hat{q} \\approx \\mu/s$, which is valid when $\\mu \\ll 1$ and $s \\ll 1$.

Beak depth was measured in millimeters for all juveniles of a focal cohort at fledging prior to a severe drought and again for the adults that survived and bred the following season. The mean beak depth of the pre-selection cohort was $\\mu_{\\text{pre}} = 9.75$ millimeters based on $N_{\\text{pre}} = 412$ birds.

Express your final answer in millimeters (mm).",
            "solution": "The problem provided is subjected to validation before any attempt at a solution is made.\n\nFirst, the givens are extracted verbatim from the problem statement:\n- Mean beak depth of the pre-selection cohort: $\\mu_{\\text{pre}} = 9.75$ mm\n- Size of the pre-selection cohort: $N_{\\text{pre}} = 412$\n- Mean beak depth of the breeding individuals after selection: $\\mu_{\\text{breed}} = 10.12$ mm\n- Size of the breeding population: $N_{\\text{breed}} = 128$\n- Slope of the linear regression of mean offspring beak depth on a single biological parent’s beak depth: $b_{\\text{OP}} = 0.27$\n- Standard Error of the slope: $\\text{SE} = 0.03$\n\nThe following assumptions and conditions are also provided:\n- The infinitesimal model with purely additive gene action is assumed.\n- Genetic variance is stable across one generation.\n- There is no genotype-by-environment interaction.\n- The measured selection differential captures the complete episode of selection.\n- Mating is random with respect to beak depth.\n- No detectable maternal effects.\n- Cross-fostering was employed to minimize common environmental effects.\n\nValidation of the problem proceeds. The problem is scientifically grounded, describing a classic scenario in quantitative evolutionary genetics consistent with well-documented field studies (e.g., *Geospiza fortis* on the Galápagos islands). It is well-posed, providing all necessary data and a clear theoretical framework (the infinitesimal model) to compute a unique answer. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity; it is a standard, formalizable problem in evolutionary biology. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the expected one-generation change in the population mean beak depth. This quantity is known as the response to selection, denoted by $R$. The fundamental equation of quantitative genetics that connects the response to selection, heritability, and the selection differential is the breeder's equation:\n$$R = h^2 S$$\nwhere $h^2$ is the narrow-sense heritability of the trait and $S$ is the selection differential. Each component must be determined from the provided data.\n\nFirst, we calculate the selection differential, $S$. The selection differential is defined as the difference between the mean phenotype of the selected parents and the mean phenotype of the entire population before selection.\nThe mean of the pre-selection cohort is given as $\\mu_{\\text{pre}} = 9.75$ mm.\nThe mean of the individuals that survived the drought and became the breeding population is $\\mu_{\\text{breed}} = 10.12$ mm.\nThus, the selection differential $S$ is:\n$$S = \\mu_{\\text{breed}} - \\mu_{\\text{pre}}$$\n$$S = 10.12 \\, \\text{mm} - 9.75 \\, \\text{mm} = 0.37 \\, \\text{mm}$$\n\nNext, we determine the narrow-sense heritability, $h^2$. Narrow-sense heritability is defined as the ratio of additive genetic variance ($V_A$) to the total phenotypic variance ($V_P$):\n$$h^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P}$$\nThe problem provides the slope of the regression of offspring phenotype on a single parent's phenotype, $b_{\\text{OP}} = 0.27$. For a trait determined by additive gene action, and under the stated conditions of random mating and no common environmental effects between parent and offspring (ensured by cross-fostering), the theoretical covariance between a single parent and its offspring is $\\text{Cov}(\\text{P, O}) = \\frac{1}{2} V_A$.\nThe slope of the linear regression of offspring on a single parent is defined as:\n$$b_{\\text{OP}} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(\\text{P, O})}{V_P}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the covariance:\n$$b_{\\text{OP}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} V_A}{V_P} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{V_A}{V_P} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} h^2$$\nTherefore, the narrow-sense heritability can be estimated as twice the slope of the single parent-offspring regression:\n$$h^2 = 2 \\times b_{\\text{OP}}$$\nUsing the given value $b_{\\text{OP}} = 0.27$:\n$$h^2 = 2 \\times 0.27 = 0.54$$\nHeritability is a dimensionless quantity. The standard error of the slope, $\\text{SE} = 0.03$, is provided to indicate the precision of the estimate but is not required for the calculation of the point estimate of $h^2$.\n\nFinally, we can compute the expected response to selection, $R$, using the breeder's equation with the calculated values of $h^2$ and $S$:\n$$R = h^2 S$$\n$$R = (0.54) \\times (0.37 \\, \\text{mm})$$\n$$R = 0.1998 \\, \\text{mm}$$\n\nThis value, $R = 0.1998$ mm, represents the expected change in the mean beak depth for the next generation's cohort of juveniles before they undergo selection, relative to the mean of the parental generation's cohort before selection.

            "introduction": "Observing a phenotypic difference between two populations in different environments is not, by itself, sufficient evidence for genetic evolution; the difference could be a plastic response to environmental cues. This problem challenges you to dissect this complexity using one of the most powerful tools in evolutionary ecology: the common-garden experiment.

            "problem": "A freshwater colonization event by threespine sticklebacks has produced populations with reduced lateral armor plates relative to their ancestral marine source. You are tasked with separating phenotypic plasticity from genetic change using a common-garden approach. As foundational premises, use the following well-tested and widely accepted bases: (i) phenotypes can be decomposed as $z = G + E + G \\times E + \\epsilon$, where $G$ is the additive genetic contribution to the trait, $E$ is the environmental contribution, $G \\times E$ is the genotype-by-environment interaction that manifests as reaction norm differences, and $\\epsilon$ is residual error; (ii) a common-garden design equalizes $E$ to reveal $G$ when comparing genotypes; (iii) maternal effects and transgenerational plasticity can persist into the first laboratory generation and are typically reduced by evaluating the second laboratory generation; (iv) a significant genotype-by-environment interaction implies that reaction norm slopes differ among genotypes, whereas a significant genotype main effect persisting across environments and generations indicates heritable divergence in mean trait value.\n\nYou collect wild $P$ generation breeders from one marine population $M$ and two independently colonized freshwater lakes $L_1$ and $L_2$ (colonized within approximately $50$ years). Within each population, controlled within-population crosses yield $F_1$ families. Each $F_1$ family is split and reared under two standardized salinity environments: a saltwater condition $S$ (marine salinity) and a freshwater condition $F$ (lake-like ionic strength). All other conditions are standardized. Adult $F_1$ are then crossed within population to generate $F_2$ families, which are again split and reared in $S$ and $F$. Lateral armor plates are counted at maturity by a blind observer. Sample sizes per population per environment per generation are approximately $n \\approx 60$ adults, drawn from at least $10$ full-sib families per group.\n\nIn the $F_2$ generation, a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with fixed factors “population of origin” (three levels: $M$, $L_1$, $L_2$) and “rearing environment” (two levels: $S$, $F$), and family as a random effect, yields the following summary for mean plate counts (mean $\\pm$ standard error) and tests of fixed effects:\n\n- Mean plate counts: $M$ in $S$: $22.1 \\pm 0.4$; $M$ in $F$: $20.3 \\pm 0.5$. $L_1$ in $S$: $12.4 \\pm 0.5$; $L_1$ in $F$: $10.7 \\pm 0.5$. $L_2$ in $S$: $13.0 \\pm 0.4$; $L_2$ in $F$: $11.4 \\pm 0.5$.\n- Population main effect: $F_{2,\\,\\text{df}} = 162.3$, $P < 0.001$.\n- Environment main effect: $F_{1,\\,\\text{df}} = 19.8$, $P < 0.001$.\n- Genotype-by-environment interaction: $F_{2,\\,\\text{df}} = 1.2$, $P = 0.30$.\n\nA parallel analysis in $F_1$ shows the same qualitative pattern but with slightly larger between-population differences, consistent with possible maternal or carryover effects. In a subset of families genotyped at the Ectodysplasin (EDA) locus, a major-effect gene known to influence plate number, the frequency of the low-plating allele is $p_M = 0.08$ in $M$ breeders and $p_{L_1} = 0.82$, $p_{L_2} = 0.79$ in $L_1$ and $L_2$ breeders; in $F_2$ progeny from $M$ reared in $F$, $p \\approx 0.08$, whereas in $F_2$ progeny from $L_1$ and $L_2$ reared in $S$ or $F$, $p \\approx 0.80$.\n\nWhich option best captures the logically warranted inference about plasticity versus genetic change, based strictly on these results and the stated bases?\n\nA. The reduced armor in lake fish is primarily due to genetic change, because a large population main effect on plate number persists across $S$ and $F$ in the $F_2$, with no detectable genotype-by-environment interaction; the modest environment effect indicates some plasticity shared across genotypes but cannot account for the between-population divergence.\n\nB. The reduced armor is entirely an environmentally induced plastic response, because the environment main effect is significant; therefore, rearing in freshwater suffices to explain the observed lake phenotypes without invoking genetic evolution.\n\nC. Because the genotype-by-environment interaction is not significant, genetic differentiation cannot be inferred; the reaction norms are parallel, so the observed divergence must be plastic.\n\nD. The $F_2$ common-garden evidence is insufficient; only a reciprocal transplant of wild-caught adults between $M$ and the lakes, without laboratory generations, can separate plasticity from genetic change in this system.",
            "solution": "We begin from the decomposition $z = G + E + G \\times E + \\epsilon$, where $z$ is the phenotypic plate count, $G$ the additive genetic effect (captured as a population main effect in a design where genotypes are nested within populations and families), $E$ the environmental effect (here salinity rearing environment), and $G \\times E$ the interaction that manifests as differing reaction norm slopes among genotypes. A properly executed common-garden design equalizes $E$ within each environment and allows inferences about $G$ and $G \\times E$ by comparing reaction norms across genotypes or populations. Further, $F_2$ evaluation reduces maternal effects and transgenerational carryover that may affect $F_1$.\n\nIn the $F_2$, the means show that marine-origin genotypes $M$ have high plate counts in both environments, $22.1$ in $S$ and $20.3$ in $F$, while lake-origin genotypes $L_1$ and $L_2$ have much lower plate counts in both environments, roughly $12.4$ to $13.0$ in $S$ and $10.7$ to $11.4$ in $F$. The environment effect reduces plates by approximately $1.7$ to $2.0$ within each population when moving from $S$ to $F$, but the between-population differences are much larger: comparing $M$ versus $L_1$, the gap in $S$ is approximately $22.1 - 12.4 = 9.7$, and in $F$ is approximately $20.3 - 10.7 = 9.6$. These nearly equal differences across environments imply parallel reaction norms (no strong $G \\times E$), consistent with the non-significant genotype-by-environment interaction ($P = 0.30$). The highly significant population main effect ($P < 0.001$) indicates that, after controlling for the environment, populations differ in mean phenotype; given that all rearing conditions other than salinity are standardized, and the effect persists into $F_2$, the most parsimonious interpretation is that these population differences are heritable (genetic) rather than solely plastic or maternal.\n\nThe significant environment main effect ($P < 0.001$) indicates there is some plasticity shared across genotypes: moving to freshwater reduces plate counts modestly for all populations. However, because the marine genotype reared in freshwater remains far from the lake genotypes reared in freshwater (approximately $20.3$ versus approximately $10.7$ to $11.4$), the environment effect alone cannot account for the observed lake phenotypes. The absence of a genotype-by-environment interaction implies that the reaction norms are parallel and that the rank ordering of populations does not change across environments; this strengthens the inference that population mean differences reflect evolved genetic divergence rather than environment-specific expression.\n\nThe allele frequency data at the Ectodysplasin (EDA) locus corroborate this inference: a high frequency of a low-plating allele in the lake populations ($p \\approx 0.8$) and low frequency in the marine population ($p \\approx 0.08$) is observed, and these frequencies persist in $F_2$ across environments. While candidate-gene data are not strictly required to conclude genetic divergence from the common-garden experiment, they are consistent with a genetic basis for the lower plate counts and argue against an explanation based solely on plasticity.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option aligns with the data and principles. The large and highly significant population main effect in $F_2$ across both $S$ and $F$, coupled with non-significant genotype-by-environment interaction, indicates that the lake populations possess heritable changes leading to reduced plate counts, and that these changes express similarly across environments. The significant environment main effect documents modest plasticity common to all populations but does not erase or explain the between-population divergence. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This option overinterprets the environment main effect. A significant environment effect establishes that plasticity exists, but it does not imply that plasticity fully explains the observed lake phenotypes. The marine genotype reared in $F$ remains far more plated than lake genotypes reared in $F$, so plasticity alone cannot account for the divergence; the population main effect in $F_2$ indicates heritable differences. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This option misinterprets the role of genotype-by-environment interaction. A non-significant $G \\times E$ does not preclude genetic differentiation; instead, it implies that differences among genotypes are parallel across environments. Genetic differentiation is captured by the population main effect, which is highly significant and large in magnitude in $F_2$. Therefore, the conclusion that divergence “must be plastic” is unwarranted. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This option dismisses the key strength of the two-generation common-garden design. Reciprocal transplants of wild-caught adults cannot, on their own, eliminate maternal effects, developmental history, or age-dependent carryover effects. In contrast, the $F_2$ common-garden design specifically addresses these issues and is sufficient to separate plasticity (environment main effect) from genetic change (population main effect persisting across environments), particularly when genotype-by-environment interaction is absent or small. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the logically warranted inference given the data is that lake populations have evolved genetically reduced armor plating, with a modest, shared plastic response to freshwater that does not account for the between-population divergence. Option A best captures this inference.",
