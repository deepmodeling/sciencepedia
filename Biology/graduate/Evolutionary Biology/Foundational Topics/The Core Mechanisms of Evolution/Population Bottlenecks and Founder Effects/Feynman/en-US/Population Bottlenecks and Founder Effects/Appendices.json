All terms like Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, allele frequency, and random sampling are standard in the field. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information ($p_0$, $k$, independence of sampling) to calculate a unique probability. The language is objective and precise. The assumptions are standard for an idealized model and do not introduce contradictions. The problem is not trivial, as it requires the correct application of probability theory to the principles of population genetics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem asks for the probability that allele $A$ is absent in a founding population of $k$ diploid individuals. This is equivalent to the event that all $2k$ gene copies at this locus are of the allele $a$.\n\nLet $p_0$ be the frequency of allele $A$ in the large, panmictic source population. We are given $p_0 = 0.1$.\nLet $q_0$ be the frequency of allele $a$. Since the locus is bi-allelic, the sum of allele frequencies must be $1$.\n$$q_0 = 1 - p_0 = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$$\nThe source population is stated to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Under HWE, the frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$) are given by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p_0 + q_0)^2$:\n- Frequency of genotype $AA$: $P(AA) = p_0^2$\n- Frequency of genotype $Aa$: $P(Aa) = 2p_0q_0$\n- Frequency of genotype $aa$: $P(aa) = q_0^2$\n\nThe condition that allele $A$ is absent from the founder population means that every single one of the $k$ founding individuals must not possess the allele $A$. The only genotype that does not contain allele $A$ is the homozygous recessive genotype, $aa$. Therefore, for allele $A$ to be completely absent from the new population, all $k$ founding individuals must have the genotype $aa$.\n\nThe probability that a single individual randomly sampled from the source population has the genotype $aa$ is equal to the frequency of that genotype in the source population, which is $P(aa) = q_0^2$.\nNumerically, this is $P(aa) = (0.9)^2 = 0.81$.\n\nThe problem states that the $k$ individuals are \"sampled at random\" and \"independently\". The probability of a sequence of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities. We require the event that the first founder is $aa$, AND the second founder is $aa$, and so on, up to the $k$-th founder being $aa$.\n\nLet $P(\\text{Allele } A \\text{ is absent})$ be the probability we seek. This is the probability that all $k$ individuals are of genotype $aa$.\n$$P(\\text{Allele } A \\text{ is absent}) = \\underbrace{P(aa) \\times P(aa) \\times \\cdots \\times P(aa)}_{k \\text{ times}}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$P(\\text{Allele } A \\text{ is absent}) = [P(aa)]^k$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(aa)$ from HWE:\n$$P(\\text{Allele } A \\text{ is absent}) = (q_0^2)^k = q_0^{2k}$$\nFinally, we substitute the given value for the allele frequency. We have $q_0 = 1 - p_0 = 0.9$.\n$$P(\\text{Allele } A \\text{ is absent}) = (0.9)^{2k}$$\n\nThis expression represents the exact probability, as a function of the number of founders $k$, that the allele $A$ is lost during the initial sampling event that founds the new population. This phenomenon is a component of the founder effect, where a loss of genetic variation occurs when a new population is established by a very small number of individuals from a larger population.\n\nAn alternative, equivalent derivation considers the sampling of alleles directly. The $k$ diploid individuals represent a total of $2k$ gene copies. Since the source population is very large, drawing these $2k$ alleles can be considered as $2k$ independent trials. The probability of drawing an allele $a$ in a single trial is $q_0 = 0.9$. The probability that all $2k$ draws result in allele $a$ is the product of the probabilities of each independent draw:\n$$P(\\text{all } 2k \\text{ alleles are } a) = (q_0)^{2k} = (0.9)^{2k}$$\nBoth derivations yield the same correct result.",

Consider the heterozygosity $H_t$, the probability that two genes sampled at random from generation $t$ carry different alleles, and its complement $F_t = 1 - H_t$, the probability of identity by descent (IBD).\n\nA long-lived habitat contraction causes a sharp, permanent population bottleneck that changes the effective size from a pre-bottleneck value $N_e^{(0)}$ to a post-bottleneck value $N_e^{(1)} = 250$.

            "solution": "The task is to derive and calculate the equilibrium heterozygosity $H^*$ in a diploid population following a permanent change in effective population size. The derivation must start from the first principles of identity by descent (IBD) under the Wright-Fisher model with mutation.\n\nLet $N_e$ be the effective population size and $\\mu$ be the per-gene, per-generation mutation rate under the infinite-alleles model. We are interested in the probability $F_t$ that two gene copies sampled at random from the population in generation $t$ are identical by descent (IBD). The heterozygosity is given by $H_t = 1 - F_t$.\n\nWe first establish the recursion relation for $F_t$. For two gene copies at generation $t$ to be IBD, they must satisfy two conditions:\n1. They must have descended from ancestral gene copies at generation $t-1$ that were themselves IBD.\n2. No mutation must have occurred in either of the two gene lineages during the single generation from $t-1$ to $t$.\n\nLet us analyze the first condition. We sample two gene copies from the diploid population of effective size $N_e$, which contains $2N_e$ gene copies in total.\n- The probability that the two sampled copies descend from the *same* ancestral gene copy in generation $t-1$ is $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$. In this case, the ancestral copies are necessarily IBD.\n- The probability that the two sampled copies descend from *different* ancestral gene copies in generation $t-1$ is $1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}$. In this case, for the ancestral copies to be IBD, they must have been a random pair of IBD genes from generation $t-1$. The probability of this is $F_{t-1}$.\nCombining these two cases, the probability that the ancestral gene copies at generation $t-1$ are IBD is:\n$$ P(\\text{Ancestors are IBD}) = \\frac{1}{2N_e} \\cdot 1 + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) F_{t-1} $$\n\nNow, let us consider the second condition. Under the infinite-alleles model, any mutation creates a new, unique allele. Therefore, for the two gene copies at generation $t$ to be IBD, no mutation can have occurred along either lineage from generation $t-1$. The probability that a single gene lineage does not mutate is $(1-\\mu)$. The probability that neither of the two lineages mutates is $(1-\\mu)^2$, assuming independence.\n\nCombining both conditions, the recursion for $F_t$ is the product of the probability that the ancestors were IBD and the probability that no mutation occurred:\n$$ F_t = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2N_e} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) F_{t-1} \\right] (1 - \\mu)^2 $$\n\nThe problem specifies that we should keep terms to first order in $\\mu$. Given that $\\mu$ is small ($\\mu \\ll 1$), we can expand $(1-\\mu)^2$:\n$$ (1-\\mu)^2 = 1 - 2\\mu + \\mu^2 $$\nNeglecting the term of order $\\mu^2$, we obtain the approximation $(1-\\mu)^2 \\approx 1 - 2\\mu$.

The analyst wishes to diagnose which mechanism is more plausible by comparing LD decay curves across recombination distances and allele frequency bins, without relying on external reference panels.\n\nFundamental definitions: For two biallelic loci with alleles $A/a$ and $B/b$, let haplotype frequencies be $P_{AB}$, $P_{Ab}$, $P_{aB}$, and $P_{ab}$, and allele frequencies be $p_A$ and $p_B$. Linkage disequilibrium is $D = P_{AB} - p_A p_B$, and a commonly used standardized measure is $r^2 = D^2 / \\left(p_A (1 - p_A) p_B (1 - p_B)\\right)$. Recombination breaks down non-random association such that, in the absence of new forces creating $D$, non-zero $D$ decays with genetic distance $c$ and generations elapsed. Genetic distance $c$ is measured in Morgans and is approximately the recombination fraction for small $c$. A population bottleneck increases the strength of random genetic drift, while a pulse of admixture instantaneously creates covariance in local ancestry across loci.\n\nYou stratify all pairs of loci into bins by recombination distance $c$ and by minor allele frequency (MAF) $q$ in the focal population. Use three MAF bins, $q \\in [0.05,0.10)$, $q \\in [0.10,0.30)$, and $q \\in [0.30,0.50]$.

            "solution": "The problem statement poses a valid and well-defined question in population genetics. It asks for a diagnostic rule to distinguish between two demographic scenarios—a population bottleneck and a single-pulse admixture event—using patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) stratified by minor allele frequency (MAF) and recombination distance ($c$). All provided definitions and stated principles are consistent with established population genetic theory.\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n- **Focal Population**: A human island population.\n- **Observation**: Elevated linkage disequilibrium (LD).\n- **Hypotheses**:\n    1.  A short, severe population bottleneck at time $t_b$ generations ago, with no recent gene flow.\n    2.

It is based on core principles of population genetics concerning linkage disequilibrium, genetic drift, and admixture. The two demographic scenarios presented are standard models in the field, and their effects on LD are theoretically well-understood. The analytical approach described is a valid and common method for characterizing LD patterns. The problem is self-contained and does not contain contradictory information or scientifically unsound premises. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe task is to differentiate between LD generated by a bottleneck (i.e., by intense genetic drift) and LD generated by admixture.\n\n**Scenario (i): Population Bottleneck**\nA population bottleneck is a severe reduction in population size, which dramatically increases the effect of genetic drift. Genetic drift is a stochastic process where allele frequencies fluctuate randomly from one generation to the next due to chance sampling of gametes.\n1.  **LD Generation**: Drift can create LD by causing chance associations between alleles at different loci. The expected value of $r^2$ due to drift between two loci separated by recombination distance $c$ in a population of constant effective size $N_e$ is approximately $\\text{E}[r^2] \\approx 1/(1 + 4N_e c)$. A severe bottleneck (very small $N_e$) will thus create substantial LD, especially for tightly linked loci (small $c$).\n2.  **Allele Frequency Dependence**: The LD created by drift is a result of random sampling. It does not systematically depend on the allele frequencies of the loci involved, other than through the heterozygosity terms $p_A(1-p_A)$ and $p_B(1-p_B)$ in the denominator of the $r^2$ definition. Therefore, if we were to analyze a measure like $D^2$, we would not expect a strong, systematic difference in the level of LD created for rare versus common variants. Consequently, the shape and amplitude of the $r^2(c)$ curves, after accounting for the average heterozygosity within each MAF bin (e.g., by rescaling), should be largely similar across bins.\n3.  **Long-Range LD**: While a bottleneck increases background LD across the genome, it does not create the systematic, chromosome-long ancestry correlations that admixture does. The LD between unlinked loci (e.g., on different chromosomes, where $c=0.5$) will be elevated to approximately $\\text{E}[r^2] \\approx 1/(2N_e+1)$, but for any realistic post-bottleneck population size, this value will be small. Thus, we expect a rapid decay of LD with recombination distance and no significant, persistent \"tail\" of LD at large $c$.\n\n**Scenario (ii): Pulse of Admixture**\nAdmixture is the mixing of two or more previously diverged populations. Let us consider two source populations (Pop 1 and Pop 2) with allele frequencies $(p_{A,1}, p_{B,1})$ and $(p_{A,2}, p_{B,2})$ at two loci.\n1.  **LD Generation**: Upon mixture, LD is generated instantaneously. The value of the disequilibrium coefficient in the admixed population is given by $D = \\alpha(1-\\alpha)(p_{A,1}-p_{A,2})(p_{B,1}-p_{B,2})$, where $\\alpha$ is the mixture proportion from Pop 1. This is known as admixture LD. This LD is non-zero as long as both loci have different frequencies in the source populations. Crucially, this LD is generated even between unlinked loci.\n2.  **Allele Frequency Dependence**: The magnitude of admixture LD is proportional to the product of the allele frequency differences between the ancestral populations. SNPs with large frequency differences will generate the most LD. In the admixed population, such SNPs are most likely to have intermediate MAFs. Very rare variants, by contrast, are less likely to have large frequency differences between ancestral populations. Therefore, we expect the amplitude of the LD decay curve ($A_b$ in the problem's notation) to be strongly dependent on the MAF bin, with higher amplitudes for intermediate-frequency variants compared to rare variants.\n3.  **Long-Range LD**: Because admixture LD is created between all pairs of differentiated loci, regardless of their physical linkage, it generates a genome-wide correlation. For a single pulse of admixture $t_a$ generations ago, the LD decays as $D_t = D_0(1-c)^{t_a}$. The expected value of $r^2$ as a function of $c$ can be approximated by a decaying exponential, $r^2(c) \\propto \\exp(-2t_a c)$. However, because admixture creates covariance in ancestry state across the entire genome, LD does not decay to zero. Instead, it decays to a positive asymptote determined by the variance in ancestry proportion across individuals. This results in a characteristic \"long-range LD tail\" where $r^2$ remains elevated even for very large $c$, including between unlinked markers on different chromosomes ($c=0.5$). The decay rate itself, captured by the parameter $\\beta \\approx 2t_a$ in the fitted model, depends on the time since admixture and should be common across all MAF bins.\n\n**Conclusion for Diagnostic Rule:**\n- **Bottleneck signature**: LD decay curves that are similar in shape across MAF bins (once scaled by heterozygosity) and a low level of LD between unlinked loci (no significant long-range tail).\n- **Admixture signature**: LD decay curves with a common decay rate $\\beta$ but significantly different amplitudes $A_b$ across MAF bins (highest for intermediate MAF). A persistent, non-zero tail of long-range LD, including elevated interchromosomal $r^2$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Diagnose a recent bottleneck if $r^2_b(c)$ curves from different MAF bins are approximately parallel in $c$ and have similar amplitudes after rescaling by within-bin heterozygosity (that is, dividing by the bin’s mean $q(1-q)$), and if there is minimal excess $r^2$ for long-range pairs (e.g., for $c \\gtrsim 0.1$ Morgans or $c \\approx 0.5$). Diagnose recent admixture if the fitted curves across MAF bins share a common decay rate $\\beta$ but show strongly different amplitudes $A_b$ across bins, with amplitudes highest in intermediate MAF bins, and if a long-range LD tail persists to large $c$ (including elevated interchromosomal signal).**\nThis option correctly summarizes the theoretical expectations derived above. The diagnosis for bottleneck correctly identifies the expected weak dependence on MAF (after scaling) and the lack of a prominent long-range signal. The diagnosis for admixture correctly identifies the strong MAF dependence of the amplitude, the common decay rate, and the critical signal of a persistent long-range LD tail.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Diagnose recent admixture if the decay rate $\\beta$ is faster in the rare-variant bin $q \\in [0.05,0.10)$ than in the common-variant bin $q \\in [0.30,0.50]$, because rare variants are younger and recombine away LD more quickly; diagnose a bottleneck when the opposite pattern holds.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The rate of decay of LD due to recombination, $D_t = D_0(1-c)^t$, depends on the recombination fraction $c$ and the time elapsed $t$. It does not depend on the allele frequencies or the age of the alleles. While rare variants may be on average younger, this does not cause the LD in which they are involved to decay at a different rate. The physical process of recombination is a property of the chromosome, not the alleles it carries. For a single admixture event, the time $t_a$ is the same for all loci, so the decay rate parameter $\\beta$ should be common across all MAF bins.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Diagnose recent admixture if, after rescaling $r^2_b(c)$ by $q(1-q)$, the curves from different MAF bins collapse onto each other and the interchromosomal average $r^2$ is near zero; diagnose a bottleneck if there is a pronounced long-range tail and strong between-bin amplitude differences.**\nThis option presents the exact opposite of the correct theoretical predictions. Admixture is characterized by *different* amplitudes across MAF bins and *significant* long-range LD. A bottleneck is characterized by relatively similar curves across MAF bins and *minimal* long-range LD. This option swaps the signatures of the two scenarios.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Using no external references, infer admixture if weighted LD constructed by multiplying $r^2$ by an allele-frequency contrast between two surrogate populations is near zero across $c$, and infer a bottleneck if such weighted LD is positive and long-range, because drift preserves allele-frequency-weighted LD while admixture does not.**\nThis option presents several issues. First, the construction of \"surrogate populations\" from the data of a single population without reference panels is non-trivial and not clearly defined. It likely refers to methods like inferring local ancestry, which goes beyond the simple analysis described. Second, and more critically, the logic is backwards. Admixture LD is directly proportional to the product of allele frequency differences between ancestral populations. Therefore, a statistic that weights LD by an estimate of this frequency contrast should be strongly positive for admixture, not near zero. Conversely, drift does not create a systematic alignment of LD with any specific axis of frequency differentiation, so such a weighted statistic should be close to zero for a bottleneck scenario. The statement \"admixture does not [preserve allele-frequency-weighted LD]\" is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nFinal analysis confirms that Option A is the only scientifically valid and robust diagnostic rule among the choices.",
