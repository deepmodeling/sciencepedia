            "problem": "Consider a very large, randomly mating diploid population (no selection, migration, or mutation) at a single biallelic autosomal locus under purely particulate (Mendelian) inheritance. Let the alleles be denoted by $A$ and $a$ with allele frequencies $p$ and $q=1-p$ among zygotes. Assume Hardy–Weinberg genotype frequencies hold at the zygote stage due to random union of gametes. Suppose phenotypic values are determined additively by this single locus with no environmental variance, such that the genotypic values are $z_{AA}=+a$, $z_{Aa}=0$, and $z_{aa}=-a$, where $a>0$ is a constant. Under purely additive gene action, the breeding value equals the genotypic value for each genotype.\n\nStarting from the definitions of Hardy–Weinberg genotype frequencies and the definitions of a population mean and variance, derive from first principles the population mean phenotype $\\bar{z}$ and the additive genetic variance $V_{A}$ among zygotes under Mendelian segregation.

            "solution": "The problem posed is a standard exercise in elementary population genetics and is well-defined, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. It requires the derivation of the population mean phenotype and the additive genetic variance from first principles under a simple additive model. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem specifies a large, randomly mating diploid population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for a single biallelic locus with alleles $A$ and $a$. The frequencies of these alleles are given as $p$ and $q$, respectively, with $p+q=1$. Under random mating, the frequencies of the three possible genotypes, $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$, are given by the Hardy–Weinberg principle as $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$.\n\nThe genotypic values ($z$) are specified as:\n$z_{AA} = +a$\n$z_{Aa} = 0$\n$z_{aa} = -a$\nwhere $a > 0$ is a constant. The problem states that gene action is purely additive, which implies two critical points: first, the heterozygote's phenotypic value is exactly intermediate to the two homozygotes, and second, the breeding value of an individual is equal to its genotypic value. Consequently, the total genetic variance ($V_G$) is equal to the additive genetic variance ($V_A$).\n\nFirst, we derive the mean phenotype of the population, denoted as $\\bar{z}$. The mean is the expected value of the genotypic value, calculated as the weighted average of the genotypic values, with the weights being the corresponding genotype frequencies.\n\n$$\n\\bar{z} = E[z] = (p^2) \\cdot z_{AA} + (2pq) \\cdot z_{Aa} + (q^2) \\cdot z_{aa}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given genotypic values:\n$$\n\\bar{z} = (p^2)(+a) + (2pq)(0) + (q^2)(-a)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{z} = a p^2 - a q^2 = a(p^2 - q^2)\n$$\n\nThis expression can be simplified by factoring the difference of squares, $p^2 - q^2 = (p-q)(p+q)$. Since $p+q=1$, we have:\n$$\n\\bar{z} = a(p-q)\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the additive genetic variance, $V_A$. As established, for this purely additive model, $V_A = V_G$. The variance of a random variable is defined as the expectation of the squared deviation from the mean, $V_G = E[(z-\\bar{z})^2]$, or equivalently, $V_G = E[z^2] - (E[z])^2 = E[z^2] - \\bar{z}^2$. We shall use the second formulation.\n\nWe must first calculate the expectation of the squared genotypic value, $E[z^2]$:\n$$\nE[z^2] = (p^2) \\cdot (z_{AA})^2 + (2pq) \\cdot (z_{Aa})^2 + (q^2) \\cdot (z_{aa})^2\n$$\n\nSubstituting the genotypic values:\n$$\nE[z^2] = (p^2)(+a)^2 + (2pq)(0)^2 + (q^2)(-a)^2\n$$\n$$\nE[z^2] = p^2 a^2 + q^2 a^2 = a^2(p^2 + q^2)\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the variance $V_A$:\n$$\nV_A = E[z^2] - \\bar{z}^2 = a^2(p^2 + q^2) - (a(p-q))^2\n$$\n$$\nV_A = a^2(p^2 + q^2) - a^2(p^2 - 2pq + q^2)\n$$\n$$\nV_A = a^2(p^2 + q^2 - p^2 + 2pq - q^2)\n$$\n$$\nV_A = a^2(2pq) = 2pqa^2\n$$\n\nThis is the general expression for the additive genetic variance under this model.\n\nThe problem requires us to evaluate these expressions for the specific case where $p=0.7$. This implies $q = 1-p = 1-0.7 = 0.3$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expressions for $\\bar{z}$ and $V_A$.\n\nFor the mean phenotype $\\bar{z}$:\n$$\n\\bar{z} = a(p-q) = a(0.7 - 0.3) = a(0.4) = 0.4a\n$$\n\nFor the additive genetic variance $V_A$:\n$$\nV_A = 2pqa^2 = 2(0.7)(0.3)a^2 = 2(0.21)a^2 = 0.42a^2\n$$\n\nThe final result is the ordered pair $(\\bar{z}, V_A)$.\n$$\n(\\bar{z}, V_A) = (0.4a, 0.42a^2)\n$$",

Thus, $V_t = V_A$, the additive genetic variance at generation $t$. Let $X_o$, $X_m$, and $X_f$ be the phenotypes (and breeding values) of the offspring, mother, and father.\n\nWe will derive the offspring variance $V_{t+1} = \\operatorname{Var}(X_o)$ using the Law of Total Variance, conditioning on the parental phenotypes $X_m$ and $X_f$:\n$$V_{t+1} = \\operatorname{Var}(X_o) = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(X_o \\mid X_m, X_f)] + \\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_o \\mid X_m, X_f])$$\n\nFirst, we identify the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[X_o \\mid X_m, X_f]$. An offspring receives half of its genes from each parent. Due to the additive nature of gene action, the expected breeding value of an offspring is the average of the parental breeding values.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X_o \\mid X_m, X_f] = \\frac{X_m + X_f}{2}$$\nThis is the midparent value. The variance of this term is the between-family variance component.\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_o \\mid X_m, X_f]) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{X_m + X_f}{2}\\right)$$\nThis calculation is identical to the one in the blending inheritance model:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{X_m + X_f}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V_t (1+r)}{2}$$\n\nSecond, we must find the term $\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(X_o \\mid X_m, X_f)]$. This represents the average within-family variance, which arises from the random process of Mendelian segregation. The offspring phenotype is $X_o = \\mathbb{E}[X_o \\mid X_m, X_f] + M_s$, where $M_s$ is the Mendelian sampling deviation. The conditional variance is thus $\\operatorname{Var}(X_o \\mid X_m, X_f) = \\operatorname{Var}(M_s \\mid X_m, X_f)$.\nThe value of $X_o$ is determined by the two gametes it receives, one from the mother ($g_m$) and one from the father ($g_f$). So, $X_o = g_m + g_f$. Based on the problem statement, we can assume $\\operatorname{Cov}(g_m, g_f \\mid X_m, X_f)=0$. Thus:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(X_o \\mid X_m, X_f) = \\operatorname{Var}(g_m \\mid X_m) + \\operatorname{Var}(g_f \\mid X_f)$$\nThe average within-family variance is the expectation of this quantity:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(X_o \\mid X_m, X_f)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(g_m \\mid X_m)] + \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(g_f \\mid X_f)]$$\nTo find the average segregation variance from a parent, $\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(g \\mid X)]$, we use the Law of Total Variance on the value of a single gamete, $g$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(g) = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(g \\mid X)] + \\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[g \\mid X])$$\nThe breeding value of an individual is the sum of the values of the two gametes that formed it, $X = g_1 + g_2$. With linkage equilibrium, these gametes are uncorrelated, so $V_t = \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\operatorname{Var}(g_1) + \\operatorname{Var}(g_2) = 2\\operatorname{Var}(g)$. This implies $\\operatorname{Var}(g) = \\frac{1}{2}V_t$.\nThe expected value of a gamete produced by a parent with breeding value $X$ is $\\mathbb{E}[g \\mid X] = \\frac{1}{2}X$. The variance of this expectation is $\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[g \\mid X]) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\frac{1}{2}X) = \\frac{1}{4}\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{4}V_t$.\nSubstituting these into the law of total variance for a gamete:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}V_t = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(g \\mid X)] + \\frac{1}{4}V_t$$\nSolving for the average segregation variance from one parent:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(g \\mid X)] = \\frac{1}{4}V_t$$\nThe average within-family variance is the sum of the segregation variances from both parents:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(X_o \\mid X_m, X_f)] = \\frac{1}{4}V_t + \\frac{1}{4}V_t = \\frac{1}{2}V_t$$\nThis is the Mendelian sampling variance, which is independent of the mating system.\nFinally, we combine the two components of total variance for $V_{t+1}$:\n$$V_{t+1} = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(X_o \\mid X_m, X_f)] + \\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_o \\mid X_m, X_f])$$\n$$V_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{2}V_t + \\frac{V_t (1+r)}{2}$$\n$$V_{t+1} = V_t \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1+r}{2}\\right) = V_t \\left(\\frac{1+1+r}{2}\\right)$$\n$$V_{t+1} = \\frac{V_t (2+r)}{2}$$\n\nThe results are:\n- Blending Inheritance: $V_{t+1} = \\frac{V_t(1+r)}{2}$\n- Particulate Inheritance: $V_{t+1} = \\frac{V_t(2+r)}{2}$\nThe key difference is the term $\\frac{1}{2}V_t$ in the particulate case, which arises from Mendelian segregation and counteracts the variance-reducing effect of averaging, conserving variance under random mating ($r=0$).",

            "problem": "Consider a large, randomly mating population with a quantitative trait $z$ measured on an interval scale. The initial phenotypic variance is $V_{P}=1$, and the initial variance attributable to transmissible additive effects under Mendelian inheritance (narrow-sense additive genetic variance) is $V_{A}=0.5$. In each generation, deterministic truncation selection is applied by an external breeder so that the realized phenotypic selection differential (the difference between the mean phenotype of the selected parents and the pre-selection population mean) is fixed at $S=1$ in trait units, independent of changes in variance across generations.\n\nTwo alternative inheritance models are considered:\n\n1. Particulate additive (Mendelian) inheritance: Assume an infinitesimal additive model with no transmission bias and random mating, so that the expected offspring phenotype is a linear regression on the midparent with slope equal to the narrow-sense heritability $h^{2}$, where $h^{2}$ is defined as $h^{2}=V_{A}/V_{P}$ at the time of selection.\n\n2. Complete blending inheritance with environmental heterogeneity refreshed each generation: Offspring phenotype equals the arithmetic mean of parental phenotypes plus an independent environmental deviation. Environmental heterogeneity is such that the total phenotypic variance is maintained at $V_{P}=1$ every generation (this isolates the effect of the collapse of the transmissible component). Under random mating and complete blending, the variance carried forward by the averaged parental contribution (the transmissible component) halves each generation, so if $V_{T}(t)$ denotes the transmissible variance at generation $t$, then $V_{T}(t+1)=\\tfrac{1}{2}V_{T}(t)$ with $V_{T}(0)=V_{A}=0.5$.\n\nUsing only first principles of quantitative genetics grounded in the regression of offspring on midparent, the definition of narrow-sense heritability $h^{2}$ as the ratio of additive (or transmissible) variance to phenotypic variance, and the definition of the phenotypic selection differential $S$ as above, do the following:\n\n- For the particulate additive model, derive the one-generation response of the mean, expressed in terms of $V_{A}$, $V_{P}$, and $S$, and then evaluate it at $V_{A}=0.5$, $V_{P}=1$, and $S=1$.\n\n- For the blending model, derive the per-generation response sequence under the same fixed $S=1$ applied every generation, starting at generation $t=0$, and compute the total cumulative change in the population mean across infinitely many generations.\n\nReport as your final answer the total cumulative change in the population mean across infinitely many generations under the blending model.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It represents a standard theoretical comparison between two models of inheritance, a cornerstone of classical quantitative genetics. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the response to selection is the regression of offspring phenotypes on the phenotypes of their parents. For a quantitative trait $z$, the expected deviation of an offspring's phenotype from the population mean is a linear function of the mid-parent's phenotypic deviation. The slope of this regression, $b_{O,MP}$, quantifies the degree to which phenotypic differences are transmitted across generations. This slope is, by definition, the narrow-sense heritability, $h^2$.\n\nThe response to selection, $R$, is the change in the mean phenotype of the population in one generation, $R = \\bar{z}_{\\text{offspring}} - \\bar{z}_{\\text{parental}}$. The selection differential, $S$, is the difference between the mean phenotype of the selected parents, $\\bar{z}_{\\text{selected}}$, and the mean of the parental generation before selection, $\\bar{z}_{\\text{parental}}$. The relationship between these quantities is given by the Breeder's Equation:\n$$\nR = b_{O,MP} S = h^{2}S\n$$\nThis equation is the first principle upon which our analysis for both models will be based. The definition of heritability, $h^2$, is the ratio of the additive genetic variance, $V_A$, to the total phenotypic variance, $V_P$. Under the particulate model, $V_A$ represents the heritable variance. In the blending model, we will use the analogous \"transmissible variance\", $V_T$.\n\nPart 1: Particulate Additive (Mendelian) Inheritance\n\nIn the Mendelian model, the narrow-sense heritability is defined as $h^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P}$. The problem states that this is an infinitesimal additive model, which allows us to use the variance components given for the initial generation to predict the immediate response.\nThe one-generation response of the mean, $R$, is given by the Breeder's Equation:\n$$\nR = h^2 S = \\frac{V_A}{V_P} S\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the one-generation response. We are asked to evaluate this for the initial condition of the population. The given values are:\nInitial additive genetic variance, $V_A = 0.5$.\nInitial phenotypic variance, $V_P = 1$.\nSelection differential, $S = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for response:\n$$\nR = \\frac{0.5}{1} \\times 1 = 0.5\n$$\nThus, the one-generation response under the particulate model is $0.5$. Under the ideal conditions of the infinitesimal model (where selection does not erode $V_A$ immediately), this response would continue for multiple generations, leading to a sustained increase in the population mean.\n\nPart 2: Complete Blending Inheritance\n\nIn the blending inheritance model, the concept of heritability must be adapted. The \"transmissible variance\", $V_T(t)$, at generation $t$ takes the place of the additive genetic variance $V_A$. The narrow-sense heritability at generation $t$, which we may denote $h_B^2(t)$, is the ratio of this transmissible variance to the total phenotypic variance, $V_P(t)$:\n$$\nh_B^2(t) = \\frac{V_T(t)}{V_P(t)}\n$$\nThe problem states that environmental heterogeneity is such that the total phenotypic variance is replenished to $V_P(t) = 1$ in every generation. Therefore, the heritability simplifies to:\n$$\nh_B^2(t) = \\frac{V_T(t)}{1} = V_T(t)\n$$\nThe response to selection in generation $t$, denoted $R(t)$, is given by applying the Breeder's Equation with this generation-specific heritability:\n$$\nR(t) = h_B^2(t) S = V_T(t) S\n$$\nWe are given that the selection differential $S$ is fixed at $S=1$. The response in generation $t$ is therefore numerically equal to the transmissible variance in that generation:\n$$\nR(t) = V_T(t)\n$$\nThe dynamics of the transmissible variance are given by the recurrence relation $V_T(t+1) = \\frac{1}{2}V_T(t)$, which reflects the loss of variance due to the averaging of parental phenotypes. The initial condition is $V_T(0) = V_A = 0.5$.\nThis is a geometric progression. We can write an explicit formula for $V_T(t)$:\n$$\nV_T(t) = V_T(0) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^t = 0.5 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^t = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^t = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t+1}\n$$\nThe response to selection in each generation is therefore:\n$$\nR(t) = V_T(t) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t+1}\n$$\nThe total cumulative change in the population mean across infinitely many generations is the sum of the responses from a starting generation $t=0$ to infinity:\n$$\n\\Delta\\bar{z}_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} R(t) = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t+1}\n$$\nThis is an infinite geometric series. We can write out the first few terms to identify its parameters:\n$$\n\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t+1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 + \\dots\n$$\nThe first term is $a = \\frac{1}{2}$ and the common ratio is $r = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $|r| < 1$, the series converges. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula $S_{\\infty} = \\frac{a}{1-r}$.\nSubstituting the values of $a$ and $r$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\bar{z}_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 1\n$$\nThe total cumulative change in the population mean under the blending inheritance model, across infinitely many generations, is exactly $1$. This result highlights a key flaw in the blending model: the heritable variation is rapidly depleted, causing the response to selection to cease quickly, in stark contrast to the sustained response possible under particulate inheritance.",
