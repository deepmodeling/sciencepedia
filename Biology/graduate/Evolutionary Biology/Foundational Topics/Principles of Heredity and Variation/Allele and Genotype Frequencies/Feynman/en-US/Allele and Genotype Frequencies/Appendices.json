It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in statistical population genetics, free of ambiguity or contradiction. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the bias of a plug-in estimator for genotype heterozygosity and the construction of a corresponding unbiased estimator. Let us proceed from first principles.\n\nThe sample counts $\\{n_{g}\\}_{g=1}^{G}$ for a sample of size $N$ drawn with replacement from a population with genotype frequencies $\\{f_{g}\\}_{g=1}^{G}$ follow a multinomial distribution, $(n_1, \\dots, n_G) \\sim \\operatorname{Multinomial}(N; f_1, \\dots, f_G)$. For any specific genotype $g$, the count $n_g$ follows a binomial distribution, $n_g \\sim \\operatorname{Binomial}(N, f_g)$. The moments of $n_g$ are therefore known:\nThe expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[n_g] = N f_g$.\nThe variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(n_g) = N f_g (1 - f_g)$.\n\nThe variance is also defined as $\\operatorname{Var}(n_g) = \\mathbb{E}[n_g^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[n_g])^2$. From this, we can find the expectation of $n_g^2$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[n_g^2] = \\operatorname{Var}(n_g) + (\\mathbb{E}[n_g])^2 = N f_g (1 - f_g) + (N f_g)^2 = N f_g - N f_g^2 + N^2 f_g^2 $$\n\nThe plug-in estimator for heterozygosity is $\\hat{H} = 1 - \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\hat{f}_g^2$, where $\\hat{f}_g = n_g/N$. We compute its expectation, $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{H}]$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{H}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[1 - \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\left(\\frac{n_g}{N}\\right)^2\\right] = 1 - \\frac{1}{N^2} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{g=1}^{G} n_g^2\\right] $$\nBy linearity of expectation, this becomes:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{H}] = 1 - \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\mathbb{E}[n_g^2] $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[n_g^2]$ derived above:\n$$ \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\mathbb{E}[n_g^2] = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} (N f_g - N f_g^2 + N^2 f_g^2) = N \\sum_{g=1}^{G} f_g - N \\sum_{g=1}^{G} f_g^2 + N^2 \\sum_{g=1}^{G} f_g^2 $$\nGiven the constraint $\\sum_{g=1}^{G} f_g = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\mathbb{E}[n_g^2] = N(1) - N \\sum_{g=1}^{G} f_g^2 + N^2 \\sum_{g=1}^{G} f_g^2 = N + (N^2 - N) \\sum_{g=1}^{G} f_g^2 $$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{H}]$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{H}] = 1 - \\frac{1}{N^2} \\left[ N + (N^2 - N) \\sum_{g=1}^{G} f_g^2 \\right] = 1 - \\frac{N}{N^2} - \\frac{N^2 - N}{N^2} \\sum_{g=1}^{G} f_g^2 $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{H}] = 1 - \\frac{1}{N} - \\frac{N-1}{N} \\sum_{g=1}^{G} f_g^2 $$\nThe true heterozygosity is $H = 1 - \\sum_{g=1}^{G} f_g^2$, which implies $\\sum_{g=1}^{G} f_g^2 = 1 - H$.

            "solution": "The problem is to derive properties of genotype counts under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and then to find the asymptotic variance of a specific estimator for the inbreeding coefficient, $\\widehat{F}$. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information. I will proceed with the solution in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we establish the population model. Under panmixia and the other assumptions of HWE at a bi-allelic locus with allele frequencies $p$ for allele $A$ and $q = 1-p$ for allele $a$, the population genotype frequencies are:\n$P(AA) = p^2$\n$P(Aa) = 2pq$\n$P(aa) = q^2$\nThe genotype counts $(X_{AA}, X_{Aa}, X_{aa})$ in a sample of $N$ individuals are assumed to follow a multinomial distribution with parameters $N$ and probabilities $\\boldsymbol{\\pi} = (p^2, 2pq, q^2)^T$. The total count is $X_{AA} + X_{Aa} + X_{aa} = N$.\n\nPart 1: Expected Genotype Counts\nThe expectation of a random variable following a multinomial distribution is given by the number of trials multiplied by the probability of the corresponding outcome. Therefore, the expected genotype counts are:\n$$E[X_{AA}] = N \\cdot P(AA) = Np^2$$\n$$E[X_{Aa}] = N \\cdot P(Aa) = N(2pq)$$\n$$E[X_{aa}] = N \\cdot P(aa) = Nq^2$$\n\nPart 2: Sampling Variance-Covariance Structure\nWe derive the variance-covariance matrix of the genotype count vector $\\mathbf{X} = (X_{AA}, X_{Aa}, X_{aa})^T$ from first principles using indicator variables. For each individual $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$, let $\\mathbf{Y}_i = (Y_{i,AA}, Y_{i,Aa}, Y_{i,aa})^T$ be a vector of indicator variables, where $Y_{i,g} = 1$ if individual $i$ has genotype $g$, and $0$ otherwise. The total genotype counts are the sum of these indicators over all individuals: $\\mathbf{X} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathbf{Y}_i$.\n\nFor a single individual, the probabilities are $E[Y_{i,AA}] = p^2$, $E[Y_{i,Aa}] = 2pq$, and $E[Y_{i,aa}] = q^2$.\nThe variance of an indicator variable $Y_{i,g}$ is $\\text{Var}(Y_{i,g}) = E[Y_{i,g}^2] - (E[Y_{i,g}])^2 = E[Y_{i,g}] - (E[Y_{i,g}])^2 = \\pi_g(1-\\pi_g)$, where $\\pi_g$ is the probability of genotype $g$.\nFor example, $\\text{Var}(Y_{i,AA}) = p^2(1-p^2)$.\n\nThe covariance between two different indicators for the same individual, say $Y_{i,g_1}$ and $Y_{i,g_2}$ with $g_1 \\neq g_2$, is $\\text{Cov}(Y_{i,g_1}, Y_{i,g_2}) = E[Y_{i,g_1}Y_{i,g_2}] - E[Y_{i,g_1}]E[Y_{i,g_2}]$.

If heterozygote misclassification is symmetric in the sense that $Aa$ is misclassified to $AA$ with probability proportional to $p$ and to $aa$ with probability proportional to $q$, then for any fixed $e \\in (0,1)$ and $F \\in (0,1)$ there exists an equality of genotype frequency distributions for all $p$.\n\nD. With data from multiple unlinked loci sharing a common inbreeding coefficient $F$ but with locus-specific symmetric misclassification rates $e_\\ell$, the mechanisms remain indistinguishable so long as the mean of the $e_\\ell$ equals $F$.\n\nE. Even under symmetric heterozygote misclassification at rate $e$ affecting only heterozygotes, the allele frequency inferred from observed genotype counts is biased unless homozygotes are also misclassified as heterozygotes at rate $e$; therefore, equality with inbreeding cannot hold without additional homozygote errors.",
            "solution": "Begin from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium as the baseline for random union of gametes without inbreeding or error. At a biallelic locus with allele frequency $p$ for $A$ and $q=1-p$ for $a$, the zygote genotype frequencies are $P(AA)=p^2$, $P(Aa)=2pq$, $P(aa)=q^2$.\n\nMechanism I (inbreeding with inbreeding coefficient $F$): By definition, $F$ is the probability that the two alleles within a diploid individual at the focal locus are identical by descent. Decompose the population into two classes: with probability $F$, an individual is autozygous; with probability $1-F$, an individual is allozygous (two alleles are not identical by descent) and hence formed by random union of gametes. In the autozygous class, individuals must be homozygous, and conditional on allele frequency $p$, the probability of being $AA$ is $p$ and $aa$ is $q$; in the allozygous class, genotype frequencies follow Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Therefore,\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP_{\\text{I}}(AA) = F\\cdot p + (1-F)\\cdot p^2 \\;=\\; p^2 + F\\,p(1-p) \\;=\\; p^2 + F\\,pq,\\\\\nP_{\\text{I}}(Aa) = F\\cdot 0 + (1-F)\\cdot 2pq \\;=\\; 2pq(1-F),\\\\\nP_{\\text{I}}(aa) = F\\cdot q + (1-F)\\cdot q^2 \\;=\\; q^2 + F\\,pq.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nMechanism II (symmetric heterozygote misclassification at rate $e$ with no inbreeding): True genotypes are $AA$ at $p^2$, $Aa$ at $2pq$, and $aa$ at $q^2$. The error process acts only on true heterozygotes $Aa$, which are reported as homozygotes with probability $e$, going to $AA$ with probability $\\tfrac{e}{2}$ and to $aa$ with probability $\\tfrac{e}{2}$; otherwise, with probability $1-e$, a true heterozygote is reported correctly as $Aa$. True homozygotes are always called correctly. Consequently, the observed genotype frequencies are\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP_{\\text{II}}(AA) = p^2 \\;+\\; \\tfrac{e}{2}\\cdot 2pq \\;=\\; p^2 + e\\,pq,\\\\\nP_{\\text{II}}(Aa) = (1-e)\\cdot 2pq \\;=\\; 2pq(1-e),\\\\\nP_{\\text{II}}(aa) = q^2 \\;+\\; \\tfrac{e}{2}\\cdot 2pq \\;=\\; q^2 + e\\,pq.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIdentifiability analysis: Comparing $P_{\\text{I}}$ and $P_{\\text{II}}$, we see immediately that for all $p \\in (0,1)$,\n$$\nP_{\\text{I}}(AA)=P_{\\text{II}}(AA),\\quad P_{\\text{I}}(Aa)=P_{\\text{II}}(Aa),\\quad P_{\\text{I}}(aa)=P_{\\text{II}}(aa)\n$$\nif and only if $F=e$. Under that equality, the two mechanisms produce exactly the same observed genotype frequency distribution at every $p$, hence they are statistically unidentifiable from single-locus genotype frequency data alone. Note also that under Mechanism II, the allele frequency inferred from observed genotype counts is\n$$\n\\hat p_{\\text{obs}} \\;=\\; P_{\\text{II}}(AA) + \\tfrac{1}{2} P_{\\text{II}}(Aa) \\;=\\; \\big(p^2 + e\\,pq\\big) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\cdot 2pq(1-e) \\;=\\; p^2 + pq \\;=\\; p,\n$$\nso the symmetric heterozygote-only misclassification preserves the allele frequency estimate, matching the allele frequency under inbreeding as well.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nA. This states precisely the condition derived above: with symmetric misclassification affecting only heterozygotes at rate $e$, the Mechanism II genotype frequencies match those under inbreeding with coefficient $F$ when $e=F$, for all $p \\in (0,1)$. Therefore, the two mechanisms are indistinguishable from single-locus genotype frequency data alone under this condition. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This claims identifiability failure occurs only at $p=\\tfrac{1}{2}$. The derivation shows the equality of distributions holds for every $p \\in (0,1)$ when $e=F$; there is no special role for $p=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ in this symmetric model. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Here, “symmetric” is redefined to mean the misclassification of $Aa$ to $AA$ occurs with probability proportional to $p$ and to $aa$ with probability proportional to $q$. In that model, if a fraction $e$ of heterozygotes are misclassified, then $P_{\\text{II}}(AA)=p^2 + 2ep^2 q$ and $P_{\\text{II}}(aa)=q^2 + 2e p q^2$, while $P_{\\text{II}}(Aa)=2pq(1-e)$. To match inbreeding, we would require $p^2 + 2e p^2 q = p^2 + F pq$ and $q^2 + 2e p q^2 = q^2 + F pq$ for all $p$. The first equality implies $2e p = F$ for all $p$, which cannot hold unless $F=0$ and $e=0$. Thus, for fixed nonzero $e$ and $F$, distributions do not match for all $p$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. With multiple loci sharing a common $F$, Mechanism I yields heterozygote frequency $2p_\\ell q_\\ell (1-F)$ at each locus $\\ell$. Mechanism II with locus-specific $e_\\ell$ yields $2p_\\ell q_\\ell (1-e_\\ell)$ at locus $\\ell$. Equality of genotype distributions at each locus requires $e_\\ell=F$ for every $\\ell$. Matching only the mean of $e_\\ell$ to $F$ is insufficient, because deviations at any locus would produce mismatched genotype frequencies at that locus, detectable with adequate sample size. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. The symmetric heterozygote-only misclassification preserves the allele frequency estimate, as shown by $\\hat p_{\\text{obs}}=p$. There is no requirement to misclassify homozygotes as heterozygotes to preserve allele frequency or to achieve equality with inbreeding; equality holds with $e=F$ even when homozygotes are always called correctly. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only option A is correct under the stated assumptions, and it identifies the precise condition under which heterozygote deficits cannot distinguish inbreeding from genotyping error at a single locus.",
