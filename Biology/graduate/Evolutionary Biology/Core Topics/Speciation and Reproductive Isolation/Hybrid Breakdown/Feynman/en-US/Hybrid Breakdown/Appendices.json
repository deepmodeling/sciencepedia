            "problem": "Consider two populations that have fixed different alleles at two unlinked nuclear loci, $L_{A}$ and $L_{B}$. Population $X$ is fixed for alleles $A_{1}$ at $L_{A}$ and $B_{1}$ at $L_{B}$, while population $Y$ is fixed for alleles $A_{2}$ at $L_{A}$ and $B_{2}$ at $L_{B}$. A single two-locus Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility (DMI) exists such that individuals with genotype $A_{1}A_{1}$ at $L_{A}$ and $B_{2}B_{2}$ at $L_{B}$ exhibit complete hybrid breakdown; all other genotypes are fully compatible.

All assumptions—Mendelian genetics, independent assortment for unlinked loci, and random mating—are standard in introductory genetics problems.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated. The initial conditions (parental genotypes), the crossing scheme ($P \\rightarrow F_1 \\rightarrow F_2$), and the specific question (frequency of a particular $F_2$ genotype) are all precisely defined. The assumptions provided are sufficient to arrive at a unique, deterministic answer.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is formal, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound. The term \"complete hybrid breakdown\" correctly refers to a postzygotic incompatibility. The question asks for the fraction of $F_2$ individuals that *carry* the specified genotype, which corresponds to the genotypic frequency expected among zygotes *before* any selection (i.e., the breakdown itself) has acted. This is a standard and unambiguous way to frame such a question. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by applying fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics.\n\n**Parental (P) Generation and First Filial ($F_1$) Generation:**\nThe parental populations have fixed genotypes. Population $X$ has the genotype $A_{1}A_{1}B_{1}B_{1}$ and produces only $A_{1}B_{1}$ gametes. Population $Y$ has the genotype $A_{2}A_{2}B_{2}B_{2}$ and produces only $A_{2}B_{2}$ gametes.\nThe cross between a representative from population $X$ and a representative from population $Y$ is:\n$$A_{1}A_{1}B_{1}B_{1} \\times A_{2}A_{2}B_{2}B_{2}$$\nAll resulting first filial ($F_1$) generation individuals will be dihybrid, with the genotype:\n$$A_{1}A_{2}B_{1}B_{2}$$\nThese individuals are fully viable as they do not possess the incompatible genotype.\n\n**Gamete Production by the $F_1$ Generation:**\nThe $F_1$ individuals have genotype $A_{1}A_{2}B_{1}B_{2}$. The problem states that the loci $L_A$ and $L_B$ are unlinked ($r = \\frac{1}{2}$), meaning they assort independently during meiosis. According to the law of independent assortment, an $F_1$ individual will produce four types of gametes in equal proportions. The frequency of each gamete type is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe four gamete types and their frequencies are:\n- $p(A_{1}B_{1}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $p(A_{1}B_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $p(A_{2}B_{1}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $p(A_{2}B_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n**Second Filial ($F_2$) Generation Genotype Frequencies:**\nThe second filial ($F_2$) generation is produced by the random mating of $F_1$ individuals among themselves. Because the population is large and mating is random, the expected genotype frequencies in the $F_2$ generation can be calculated by treating the process as independent segregation at each locus.\n\nWe can analyze the inheritance at each locus separately. For a given locus, say $L_A$, the random mating of $F_1$ individuals is equivalent to a large number of $A_{1}A_{2} \\times A_{1}A_{2}$ crosses.\n\n1.  **Frequency of the $A_{1}A_{1}$ genotype at locus $L_{A}$**:\n    The allele frequencies for $A_1$ and $A_2$ in the $F_1$ gamete pool are both $\\frac{1}{2}$. Under random mating (equivalent to a monohybrid cross here), the expected genotype frequencies at locus $L_A$ are given by standard Mendelian ratios:\n    - $p(A_{1}A_{1}) = p(A_1 \\text{ gamete}) \\times p(A_1 \\text{ gamete}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    - $p(A_{1}A_{2}) = 2 \\times p(A_1) \\times p(A_2) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n    - $p(A_{2}A_{2}) = p(A_2) \\times p(A_2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    The required frequency for the first part of the incompatible genotype is $p(A_{1}A_{1}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n2.  **Frequency of the $B_{2}B_{2}$ genotype at locus $L_{B}$**:\n    Similarly, for locus $L_B$, the random mating of $F_1$ individuals is equivalent to a series of $B_{1}B_{2} \\times B_{1}B_{2}$ crosses. The allele frequencies for $B_1$ and $B_2$ in the $F_1$ gamete pool are both $\\frac{1}{2}$. The expected genotype frequencies are:\n    - $p(B_{1}B_{1}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    - $p(B_{1}B_{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n    - $p(B_{2}B_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    The required frequency for the second part of the incompatible genotype is $p(B_{2}B_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**Combined Genotype Frequency:**\nSince the loci $L_A$ and $L_B$ are unlinked and assort independently, the probability of an $F_2$ individual inheriting a specific genotype at both loci is the product of the probabilities of inheriting each genotype separately. We seek the frequency of individuals with the genotype $A_{1}A_{1}B_{2}B_{2}$.\n$$p(A_{1}A_{1}B_{2}B_{2}) = p(A_{1}A_{1}) \\times p(B_{2}B_{2})$$\nSubstituting the calculated frequencies:\n$$p(A_{1}A_{1}B_{2}B_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$$\nThis is the expected fraction of $F_2$ zygotes that carry the incompatible genotype combination. This calculation is performed for the zygotic stage, before the effects of selection (complete hybrid breakdown) manifest.\n\nThus, the exact expected fraction of $F_2$ individuals that carry the incompatible genotype combination $A_{1}A_{1}B_{2}B_{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{16}$.",

No numerical rounding is required, and no units should be reported.",
            "solution": "We begin from basic genetic principles: Mendelian segregation and the definition of the recombination fraction. The recombination fraction $r$ is the probability that a gamete produced by a meiosis in a doubly heterozygous individual at loci $A$ and $B$ is recombinant with respect to those loci. Under standard two-locus meiosis without gene conversion, a coupling-phase double heterozygote (phase $A_{1}B_{1} / A_{2}B_{2}$) produces four haplotypic gamete types. The nonrecombinant haplotypes $A_{1}B_{1}$ and $A_{2}B_{2}$ together occur with probability $1 - r$, and by symmetry each has probability $(1 - r)/2$. The recombinant haplotypes $A_{1}B_{2}$ and $A_{2}B_{1}$ together occur with probability $r$, and by symmetry each has probability $r/2$.\n\nBecause all $F_1$ individuals are genetically identical and we assume random mating with identical recombination in both sexes, the gametes forming the $F_2$ are drawn independently from the same haplotype distribution:\n- $P(\\text{gamete } A_{1}B_{1}) = (1 - r)/2$,\n- $P(\\text{gamete } A_{2}B_{2}) = (1 - r)/2$,\n- $P(\\text{gamete } A_{1}B_{2}) = r/2$,\n- $P(\\text{gamete } A_{2}B_{1}) = r/2$.\n\nBy the problem’s DMI definition, the only inviable $F_2$ genotype is the double homozygote $A_{1}A_{1}B_{2}B_{2}$. To obtain $A_{1}A_{1}$ at locus $A$, both gametes must carry $A_{1}$; to obtain $B_{2}B_{2}$ at locus $B$, both gametes must carry $B_{2}$. The only haplotype that carries both $A_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ is $A_{1}B_{2}$. Therefore, the zygote $A_{1}A_{1}B_{2}B_{2}$ can arise only when both parental gametes are $A_{1}B_{2}$.\n\nLet $p_{A_{1}B_{2}}$ denote the frequency of the $A_{1}B_{2}$ gamete among $F_1$ gametes. As established above, $p_{A_{1}B_{2}} = r/2$.

Population $P_{1}$ is fixed for mitochondrial haplotype $M_{1}$ and the nuclear allele $A$ at an autosomal locus $N$; population $P_{2}$ is fixed for mitochondrial haplotype $M_{2}$ and the nuclear allele $B$ at the same locus. Assume strictly maternal inheritance of mitochondria with no paternal leakage, random mating, and no selection prior to viability selection in the second filial generation ($F_2$).

It describes a standard model of mitonuclear Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe initial populations are $P_{1}$, with genotype $(M_{1}, AA)$, and $P_{2}$, with genotype $(M_{2}, BB)$, where $M_{i}$ denotes the mitochondrial haplotype and $AA/BB$ denotes the diploid nuclear genotype at locus $N$.\n\nFirst, we determine the composition of the first filial generation ($F_1$). The $F_1$ is produced from two reciprocal crosses.\n1.  A cross between a $P_{1}$ female and a $P_{2}$ male is $(M_{1}, AA) \\times (M_{2}, BB)$. Since mitochondria are inherited maternally and nuclear genes follow Mendelian rules, all offspring from this cross have the mitonuclear genotype $(M_{1}, AB)$.\n2.  A cross between a $P_{2}$ female and a $P_{1}$ male is $(M_{2}, BB) \\times (M_{1}, AA)$. All offspring from this cross have the mitonuclear genotype $(M_{2}, AB)$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the reciprocal $F_1$s are pooled.
