The additive genetic variance-covariance matrix, $G$, biases the evolutionary trajectory, channeling it along paths of greater genetic variation. This first exercise  provides a concrete example of this principle, challenging you to determine the maximal possible response to selection for a given $G$-matrix. By doing so, you will directly engage with the concepts of directional evolvability and the 'line of least evolutionary resistance', which corresponds to the direction of greatest genetic variance ($g_{max}$) and is dictated by the leading eigenvector of $G$.",

The governing equation, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{G} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, is the standard multivariate breeder's equation, a fundamental concept in evolutionary quantitative genetics. The given $\\mathbf{G}$ matrix is symmetric. To be a valid covariance matrix, it must also be positive definite. The eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}$, which we will compute, are $4$, $1$, and $1$. As all are positive, $\\mathbf{G}$ is positive definite. The problem is well-posed, as it asks for the maximum of a continuous function (a quadratic form) over a compact set (the unit sphere), for which a maximum is guaranteed to exist. The problem is objective and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The problem is declared valid.\n\nSolution:\nThe change in the mean trait vector, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$, under directional selection is given by the multivariate breeder's equation:\n$$ \\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{G} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} $$\nThe selection gradient, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, is specified as having a magnitude $b  0$ and a direction given by the unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = b \\hat{\\mathbf{s}} $$\nwhere $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$ is a column vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying $\\|\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}\\| = \\sqrt{\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}^T \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}} = 1$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ into the breeder's equation gives the response vector:\n$$ \\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{G} (b \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}) = b (\\mathbf{G} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}) $$\nThe problem defines the \"directional response per unit selection strength along $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$\" as the scalar projection of the response vector $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$ onto the direction of selection $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$, all divided by the magnitude of selection $b$.\n\nThe scalar projection of a vector $\\vec{u}$ onto a unit vector $\\vec{v}$ is given by their dot product, $\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}$. In matrix notation, for column vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ where $\\mathbf{v}$ is a unit vector, this is $\\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{u}$.\nThus, the scalar projection of $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$ onto $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$ is $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}^T (\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})$.\nThe quantity to be maximized, let us call it $R(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}})$, is therefore:\n$$ R(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}^T (\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})}{b} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$:\n$$ R(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}^T (b \\mathbf{G} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}})}{b} = \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}^T \\mathbf{G} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}} $$\nThis quantity, $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}^T \\mathbf{G} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$, represents the additive genetic variance in the direction of the vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$, also known as the evolvability in direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum value of the function $R(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}) = \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}^T \\mathbf{G} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$ subject to the constraint that $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$ is a unit vector, $\\|\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}\\| = 1$ (or $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}^T \\hat{\\mathbf{s}} = 1$).\nThe expression $\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}^T \\mathbf{G} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}}{\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}^T \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}}$ is the Rayleigh quotient of the matrix $\\mathbf{G}$.

For $n=3$, the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{J}$ are $\\{3, 0, 0\\}$.\nLet $\\mathbf{v}$ be an eigenvector of $\\mathbf{J}$ with eigenvalue $\\mu_J$. Then $\\mathbf{J}\\mathbf{v} = \\mu_J \\mathbf{v}$.\nConsider the action of $\\mathbf{G}$ on this eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{G}\\mathbf{v} = (\\mathbf{I}+\\mathbf{J})\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{J}\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v} + \\mu_J \\mathbf{v} = (1+\\mu_J)\\mathbf{v} $$\nThis shows that $\\mathbf{v}$ is also an eigenvector of $\\mathbf{G}$, with eigenvalue $\\lambda_G = 1 + \\mu_J$.\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}$ can be found by adding $1$ to each eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{J}$.\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}$ are:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = 1 + 0 = 1 $$\n$$ \\lambda_3 = 1 + 0 = 1 $$\nThe set of eigenvalues for $\\mathbf{G}$ is $\\{4, 1, 1\\}$.\n\nThe maximum value of the directional response per unit selection strength, $R(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}) = \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}^T \\mathbf{G} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$, is the largest eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{G}$.\n$$ \\max_{\\|\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}\\|=1} R(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}) = \\lambda_{\\text{max}}(\\mathbf{G}) = 4 $$\nThis maximum response occurs when the direction of selection $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$ is aligned with the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda=4$. This eigenvector is proportional to $(1, 1, 1)^T$, representing selection for an equal increase in all three traits.\n\nThe maximum possible value is an exact real number.",

Magnitude of the Response Vector, $\\|\\Delta \\mathbf{z}\\|_2$**\n\nThis is a direct application of the Lande equation. First, we compute the response vector $\\Delta \\mathbf{z}$:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{G} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} $$\nThen, we compute its Euclidean norm:\n$$ \\|\\Delta \\mathbf{z}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{ (\\Delta \\mathbf{z})^T (\\Delta \\mathbf{z}) } = \\sqrt{ (\\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T (\\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) } = \\sqrt{ \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T \\mathbf{G}^T \\mathbf{G} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} } $$\nSince $\\mathbf{G}$ is symmetric ($\\mathbf{G}^T = \\mathbf{G}$), this is equivalent to $\\sqrt{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T \\mathbf{G}^2 \\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$. For computation, it is most direct to first calculate the vector $\\Delta \\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and then find its norm.\n\n**4. Angle Between the Response Vector $\\Delta \\mathbf{z}$ and the Selection Gradient $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$**\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ between two non-zero vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ is given by the formula derived from the Euclidean inner product:\n$$ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{u}^T \\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2 \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2} $$\nIn our case, $\\mathbf{u} = \\Delta \\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and $\\mathbf{v} = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. Therefore, the angle is:\n$$ \\theta = \\arccos\\left( \\frac{(\\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T \\boldsymbol{\\beta}}{\\|\\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\|_2 \\|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\|_2} \\right) = \\arccos\\left( \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T \\mathbf{G} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}}{\\|\\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\|_2 \\|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\|_2} \\right) $$\nThe value of $\\theta$ quantifies the degree to which the evolutionary response aligns with the direction of selection. A value of $\\theta = 0$ indicates perfect alignment, while $\\theta  0$ indicates that genetic correlations (off-diagonal elements of $\\mathbf{G}$) cause the population to evolve in a direction different from the one favored by selection. Since $\\mathbf{G}$ is positive semidefinite, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T \\mathbf{G} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\geq 0$, so the angle $\\theta$ will be in the range $[0, \\pi/2]$ radians.\n\n**5. Squared Cosine of the Alignment with the Leading Eigenvector**\n\nThis metric assesses how well the direction of selection aligns with the direction of greatest genetic variance. The eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{G}$ represent the principal axes of genetic variation, and the corresponding eigenvalues represent the amount of variance along those axes.\nThe steps to compute this are:\n1.  Perform an eigendecomposition of the symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{G}$ to find its eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ and corresponding eigenvectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$.\n2.  Identify the leading eigenvector, $\\mathbf{v}_{max}$, which is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{max}$. This vector represents the direction of maximum additive genetic variance ($g_{max}$). We assume it is normalized to unit length, i.e., $\\|\\mathbf{v}_{max}\\|_2 = 1$.\n3.  Normalize the selection gradient vector to get the unit selection direction, $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\boldsymbol{\\beta} / \\|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\|_2$.\n4.  The cosine of the angle $\\phi$ between $\\mathbf{v}_{max}$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ is their dot product: $\\cos(\\phi) = \\mathbf{v}_{max}^T \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$.\n5.  The requested quantity is the square of this cosine:\n$$ (\\cos(\\phi))^2 = (\\mathbf{v}_{max}^T \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})^2 $$\nThis value, ranging from $0$ to $1$, measures the alignment. A value of $1$ signifies that selection acts along the direction of maximum genetic variance, while a value of $0$ signifies that it acts along a direction orthogonal to it.\n\nThese five derived formulas form the basis for the computational implementation. Each will be calculated for the given test cases.",
