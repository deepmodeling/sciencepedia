Before applying this concept to predict evolutionary change, it's crucial to understand how $r_G$ is derived from the underlying additive genetic variances and covariances. This foundational exercise  will guide you through calculating the genetic correlation from the components of the $\\mathbf{G}$-matrix and interpreting its sign in the context of a potential evolutionary trade-off.",

            "problem": "In a sexually reproducing population, two quantitative traits, $z_1$ and $z_2$, are influenced by many loci with additive effects, and pleiotropy generates genetic covariances among traits. Assume linkage equilibrium and that environmental effects are independent across traits. Let the additive genetic variance-covariance structure for $(z_1,z_2)$ be summarized by the additive genetic variances $V_{A1}$ for $z_1$ and $V_{A2}$ for $z_2$, and the additive genetic covariance $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1,z_2)$. The genetic correlation $r_G$ between $z_1$ and $z_2$ is defined in terms of these additive components and captures how pleiotropic alleles align their additive effects across traits.\n\nYou are given $V_{A1}=2.0$, $V_{A2}=1.0$, and $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1,z_2)=-0.6$. Starting from the fundamental definitions of variance, covariance, and correlation for random variables, derive the expression for the genetic correlation $r_G$ in terms of $V_{A1}$, $V_{A2}$, and $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1,z_2)$, then compute its value for the given parameters. Using the multivariate breeder’s equation as a conceptual framework for correlated responses to selection, explain the consequence of the sign of $r_G$ for the direction of the correlated response of $z_2$ when directional selection acts to increase the mean of $z_1$ and there is no direct selection on $z_2$.\n\nReport only the value of $r_G$ as your final answer, expressed as an exact expression in simplest radical form. Do not round. No units are required for the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the genetic correlation, $r_G$, and an explanation of its consequences for correlated evolution based on the multivariate breeder's equation.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of the formula for genetic correlation, $r_G$. The general definition for the correlation coefficient, $\\rho$, between any two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by their covariance divided by the product of their standard deviations:\n$$ \\rho_{XY} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X)} \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(Y)}} $$\nIn the context of quantitative genetics, the traits $z_1$ and $z_2$ can be decomposed into additive genetic components (breeding values), which we denote as $A_1$ and $A_2$, and other components (dominance, epistasis, environment). The problem specifies that pleiotropy generates genetic covariances, and it is the additive components that are relevant for the response to selection. The genetic correlation $r_G$ is precisely the correlation between the breeding values of the two traits.\n\nThe given parameters are the additive genetic variances and covariance:\n$V_{A1} = \\mathrm{Var}(A_1) = 2.0$\n$V_{A2} = \\mathrm{Var}(A_2) = 1.0$\n$\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) = \\mathrm{Cov}(A_1, A_2) = -0.6$\n\nApplying the general definition of correlation to the breeding values $A_1$ and $A_2$, the genetic correlation $r_G$ is:\n$$ r_G = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(A_1, A_2)}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(A_1)} \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(A_2)}} $$\nBy substituting the standard notation from the problem statement, we derive the expression for the genetic correlation:\n$$ r_G = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2)}{\\sqrt{V_{A1} V_{A2}}} $$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $r_G$ using the provided data: $V_{A1} = 2.0$, $V_{A2} = 1.0$, and $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) = -0.6$.\n$$ r_G = \\frac{-0.6}{\\sqrt{2.0 \\times 1.0}} = \\frac{-0.6}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nTo express this in simplest radical form, we convert the decimal to a fraction, $-0.6 = -\\frac{6}{10} = -\\frac{3}{5}$.\n$$ r_G = \\frac{-3/5}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{3}{5\\sqrt{2}} $$\nRationalizing the denominator gives:\n$$ r_G = -\\frac{3 \\times \\sqrt{2}}{5\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{5 \\times 2} = -\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{10} $$\n\nFinally, we explain the consequence of the sign of $r_G$ using the conceptual framework of the multivariate breeder's equation. The equation describes the vector of evolutionary responses, $\\Delta\\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$, as the product of the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix, $\\mathbf{G}$, and the selection gradient vector, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} $$\nFor the two traits $z_1$ and $z_2$, this is written as:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta\\bar{z}_1 \\\\ \\Delta\\bar{z}_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} V_{A1} & \\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) \\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) & V_{A2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe problem states that directional selection acts to increase the mean of $z_1$, implying a positive selection gradient $\\beta_1 > 0$. There is no direct selection on $z_2$, which means its selection gradient is zero, $\\beta_2 = 0$. Substituting these conditions into the equation yields the responses for each trait:\n$$ \\Delta\\bar{z}_1 = V_{A1} \\beta_1 + \\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) \\times 0 = V_{A1} \\beta_1 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\bar{z}_2 = \\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) \\beta_1 + V_{A2} \\times 0 = \\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) \\beta_1 $$\nThe response in $z_1$ is the direct response to selection, and since $V_{A1} > 0$ and $\\beta_1 > 0$, $\\Delta\\bar{z}_1$ is positive, as expected. The response in $z_2$ is the correlated response, $\\Delta\\bar{z}_2$, and its direction is determined by the sign of the genetic covariance, $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2)$, as $\\beta_1$ is positive.\n\nFrom our derived formula, $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) = r_G \\sqrt{V_{A1} V_{A2}}$. The term $\\sqrt{V_{A1} V_{A2}}$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the sign of the covariance is identical to the sign of the genetic correlation $r_G$. Consequently, the sign of the correlated response $\\Delta\\bar{z}_2$ is determined by the sign of $r_G$.\nIn our case, $r_G$ is negative ($r_G = -\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{10}$). This implies that a negative genetic covariance exists between the traits, which is indicative of a genetic trade-off. When selection acts to increase the mean of trait $z_1$ (positive $\\beta_1$), the correlated response in trait $z_2$ will be negative:\n$$ \\Delta\\bar{z}_2 = \\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) \\beta_1 < 0 $$\nThus, the mean of trait $z_2$ is predicted to decrease. This demonstrates how pleiotropy, as summarized by the genetic correlation, can cause selection on one trait to induce an evolutionary response in another, even a response that may be contrary to any direct selective pressures.",

            "solution": "The fundamental equation governing the per-generation change in the vector of mean trait values, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$, under directional selection is given by the multivariate breeder's equation:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{G} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{G}$ is the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is the selection gradient vector. The vector $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$ has components representing the expected change in the mean of each trait. For the two traits $z_1$ and $z_2$, this can be written in component form as:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta \\bar{z}_1 \\\\ \\Delta \\bar{z}_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem provides the specific matrices for $\\mathbf{G}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G} = \\begin{pmatrix} G_{11} & G_{12} \\\\ G_{21} & G_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.8 & 0.12 \\\\ 0.12 & 0.5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.6 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Lande equation, we have:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta \\bar{z}_1 \\\\ \\Delta \\bar{z}_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.8 & 0.12 \\\\ 0.12 & 0.5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.6 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe perform the matrix-vector multiplication to find the components of the response vector, $\\Delta \\bar{z}_1$ and $\\Delta \\bar{z}_2$. The change in the mean of trait $z_1$ is the direct response to selection:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z}_1 = G_{11} \\beta_1 + G_{12} \\beta_2 = (0.8)(0.6) + (0.12)(0) = 0.48\n$$\nThe quantity of interest is the change in the mean of trait $z_2$, which is given by the second row of the resulting vector:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z}_2 = G_{21} \\beta_1 + G_{22} \\beta_2\n$$\nSince the genetic covariance matrix $\\mathbf{G}$ is symmetric, we have $G_{21} = G_{12} = 0.12$. Substituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z}_2 = (0.12)(0.6) + (0.5)(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z}_2 = 0.072 + 0 = 0.072\n$$\nThis result, $\\Delta \\bar{z}_2$, is the correlated response in trait $z_2$.\n\nThe derivation makes the role of the off-diagonal genetic covariance, $G_{12}$, explicit. The total response in trait $z_2$ is the sum of two components: $G_{21} \\beta_1$ (the indirect response caused by selection on trait $z_1$) and $G_{22} \\beta_2$ (the direct response caused by selection on trait $z_2$). The problem states that selection acts directly only on $z_1$, meaning the selection gradient for $z_2$ is zero, i.e., $\\beta_2 = 0$. Consequently, the direct response term $G_{22} \\beta_2$ vanishes.\n\nTherefore, the entire evolutionary change in the mean of trait $z_2$ is a correlated response, driven entirely by selection on trait $z_1$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z}_2 = G_{21} \\beta_1 = G_{12} \\beta_1\n$$\nThe existence of a non-zero genetic covariance, $G_{12} = 0.12$, indicates that the two traits are not genetically independent. This covariance arises from pleiotropy (genes affecting both traits) and/or linkage disequilibrium (non-random association of alleles at different loci affecting the traits). When selection favors certain alleles for trait $z_1$ ($\\beta_1 > 0$), it indirectly favors the alleles for trait $z_2$ that are genetically associated with them. A positive $G_{12}$ signifies that alleles which tend to increase $z_1$ also tend to increase $z_2$. As a result, selection for an increase in $z_1$ (mandible length) causes a passive, or correlated, increase in $z_2$ (orbit diameter), even though there is no direct fitness advantage associated with orbit diameter itself ($\\beta_2 = 0$). If $G_{12}$ were zero, there would be no correlated response, and $\\Delta \\bar{z}_2$ would be zero.\n\nThe expected per-generation correlated response in the mean of trait $z_2$ is $0.072$ trait standard deviation units.",
