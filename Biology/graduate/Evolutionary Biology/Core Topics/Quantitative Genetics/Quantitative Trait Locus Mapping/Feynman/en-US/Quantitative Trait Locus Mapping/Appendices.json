The codings for additive and dominance effects are a common choice in the field. The setup describes a typical F2 intercross experiment.

No flaws are identified.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expected phenotypic means for each of the three genotype classes, denoted as $\\mu_{\\mathrm{AA}}$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{AB}}$, and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{BB}}$. We use the provided linear model and the property that the expectation of the residual error is zero, $\\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_i]=0$.\n\nFor an individual with genotype $\\mathrm{AA}$, the codings are $X_A=-1$ and $X_D=0$. The expected phenotype is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\mathbb{E}[y | \\text{genotype is AA}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu + a(-1) + d(0) + \\varepsilon_i] = \\mu - a + \\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_i] = \\mu - a\n$$\n\nFor an individual with genotype $\\mathrm{AB}$, the codings are $X_A=0$ and $X_D=1$.

The expected phenotype is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{BB}} = \\mathbb{E}[y | \\text{genotype is BB}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu + a(1) + d(0) + \\varepsilon_i] = \\mu + a + \\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_i] = \\mu + a\n$$\n\nThis establishes a system of three linear equations relating the expected genotypic values to the model parameters $\\mu$, $a$, and $d$:\n1.  $\\mu_{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\mu - a$\n2.  $\\mu_{\\mathrm{AB}} = \\mu + d$\n3.  $\\mu_{\\mathrm{BB}} = \\mu + a$\n\nThe principle of least squares seeks to find the parameter values that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE), $SSE = \\sum_i (y_i - \\mathbb{E}[y_i])^2$. In this model, the individuals are partitioned into three distinct genotype groups. The total SSE can be decomposed into the sum of SSE for each group:\n$$\nSSE = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{AA}} (y_i - \\mu_{\\mathrm{AA}})^2 + \\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{AB}} (y_i - \\mu_{\\mathrm{AB}})^2 + \\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{BB}} (y_i - \\mu_{\\mathrm{BB}})^2\n$$\nTo minimize the total $SSE$, one must minimize each term independently. The value of a group's theoretical mean (e.g., $\\mu_{\\mathrm{AA}}$) that minimizes that group's sum of squares is the sample mean of the observations in that group (e.g., $\\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{AA}}$).

To express it with four, we write $\\hat{d} = -0.1350$.\n\nThe estimated additive effect is $\\hat{a} = 2.408 \\text{ mm}$, and the estimated dominance deviation is $\\hat{d} = -0.1350 \\text{ mm}$.",

This results in a $BC_1$ individual of genotype $Q^Q Q^q$, which is denoted as $Qq$ in the problem statement.\n- $H_q$: The gamete transmitted by the $F_1$ parent contains the allele $Q^q$.

According to Mendelian segregation, in the absence of selection or segregation distortion, the probability of transmitting either allele is equal.\n$$P(H_Q) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(H_q) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNext, we determine the likelihoods, $P(E \\mid H_Q)$ and $P(E \\mid H_q)$.

The parental haplotypes are $(M_1^A, Q^Q, M_2^A)$ and $(M_1^a, Q^q, M_2^a)$. The recombination fraction $\\theta$ is the probability that a gamete is recombinant for two loci. The probability of non-recombination is $1-\\theta$. The assumption of no chromatid interference implies that recombination events in the $M_1-Q$ and $Q-M_2$ intervals are independent.\n\nLet us compute the likelihood $P(E \\mid H_Q) = P(\\text{gamete has } M_1^A, M_2^a \\mid \\text{gamete has } Q^Q)$.\nConditional on the gamete containing the $Q^Q$ allele, its origin is the parental chromosome carrying $(M_1^A, Q^Q, M_2^A)$.\nFor this gamete to also contain the marker allele $M_1^A$, the segment from $M_1$ to $Q$ must be non-recombinant. The probability of this event is $1-\\theta_1$.\nFor this gamete to also contain the marker allele $M_2^a$, the segment from $Q$ to $M_2$ must be recombinant, as the parental chromosome carried $M_2^A$. The probability of this event is $\\theta_2$.\nDue to the independence of recombination events in the two intervals, the likelihood is the product of these probabilities:\n$$P(E \\mid H_Q) = (1-\\theta_1)\\theta_2$$\n\nNow, let us compute the likelihood $P(E \\mid H_q) = P(\\text{gamete has } M_1^A, M_2^a \\mid \\text{gamete has } Q^q)$.\nConditional on the gamete containing the $Q^q$ allele, its origin is the parental chromosome carrying $(M_1^a, Q^q, M_2^a)$.\nFor this gamete to also contain the marker allele $M_1^A$, the segment from $M_1$ to $Q$ must be recombinant, as the parental chromosome carried $M_1^a$. The probability of this event is $\\theta_1$.\nFor this gamete to also contain the marker allele $M_2^a$, the segment from $Q$ to $M_2$ must be non-recombinant. The probability of this event is $1-\\theta_2$.\nThe likelihood is therefore:\n$$P(E \\mid H_q) = \\theta_1(1-\\theta_2)$$\n\nNow we can compute the marginal probability of the evidence, $P(E)$:\n$$P(E) = P(E \\mid H_Q) P(H_Q) + P(E \\mid H_q) P(H_q) = (1-\\theta_1)\\theta_2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\theta_1(1-\\theta_2) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(E) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (1-\\theta_1)\\theta_2 + \\theta_1(1-\\theta_2) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\theta_2 - \\theta_1\\theta_2 + \\theta_1 - \\theta_1\\theta_2) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\theta_1 + \\theta_2 - 2\\theta_1\\theta_2)$$\n\nFinally, we substitute these components into Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities.\nThe posterior probability of the $Qq$ genotype is:\n$$P(H_Q \\mid E) = P(Qq \\mid \\text{markers}) = \\frac{P(E \\mid H_Q) P(H_Q)}{P(E)} = \\frac{(1-\\theta_1)\\theta_2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2 - 2\\theta_1\\theta_2)} = \\frac{(1-\\theta_1)\\theta_2}{\\theta_1 + \\theta_2 - 2\\theta_1\\theta_2}$$\n\nThe posterior probability of the $qq$ genotype is:\n$$P(H_q \\mid E) = P(qq \\mid \\text{markers}) = \\frac{P(E \\mid H_q) P(H_q)}{P(E)} = \\frac{\\theta_1(1-\\theta_2) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2 - 2\\theta_1\\theta_2)} = \\frac{\\theta_1(1-\\theta_2)}{\\theta_1 + \\theta_2 - 2\\theta_1\\theta_2}$$\n\nThese two probabilities sum to $1$, as required:\n$$\\frac{(1-\\theta_1)\\theta_2 + \\theta_1(1-\\theta_2)}{\\theta_1 + \\theta_2 - 2\\theta_1\\theta_2} = \\frac{\\theta_2 - \\theta_1\\theta_2 + \\theta_1 - \\theta_1\\theta_2}{\\theta_1 + \\theta_2 - 2\\theta_1\\theta_2} = \\frac{\\theta_1 + \\theta_2 - 2\\theta_1\\theta_2}{\\theta_1 + \\theta_2 - 2\\theta_1\\theta_2} = 1$$\nThe final answer is presented as a two-entry row vector.",
