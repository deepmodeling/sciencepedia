To truly master the theory, it is essential to understand not just what these processes are, but what specific outcomes each one is responsible for.

            "problem": "You are studying a host–parasite interaction between a freshwater snail and a trematode across an archipelago of isolated crater lakes. Field and reciprocal-transplant experiments reveal spatial heterogeneity in reciprocal selection: in $k$ of $n$ lakes (with $1 \\leq k lt; n$), both species impose strong reciprocal fitness gradients on each other, whereas in the remaining $n-k$ lakes only one species experiences appreciable selection from the interaction. Whole-genome resequencing and mark–recapture estimates indicate that pairwise migration rates among lakes are effectively zero (for all lake pairs $i \\neq j$, $m_{ij} \\approx 0$ per generation), and demographic reconstructions show effective population sizes (effective population size, $N_e$) in each lake are sufficiently large that genetic drift is negligible over the timescale of the study. The ecological contexts that mediate interaction strength (predator densities, nutrient loads, and thermal regimes) differ among lakes and are stable across the study period.\n\nThe Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution (GMTC) posits three core processes: geographic selection mosaics, coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots, and trait remixing through gene flow and genetic drift. In this system, two of these processes clearly occur (geographic selection mosaics and a mosaic of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots), whereas one does not (trait remixing via gene flow and drift).\n\nWhich option best describes which GMTC predictions are expected to persist and which are expected to fail in this counterexample?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for scientific soundness and logical consistency.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   **System:** A host–parasite interaction between a freshwater snail and a trematode.\n-   **Geography:** An archipelago of $n$ isolated crater lakes.\n-   **Selection Mosaic:** In $k$ lakes, where $1 \\leq k  n$, strong reciprocal fitness gradients exist (coevolutionary hotspots). In the remaining $n-k$ lakes, only one species experiences appreciable selection (coevolutionary coldspots). The ecological contexts mediating these interactions are heterogeneous among lakes and stable over time.\n-   **Gene Flow:** Pairwise migration rates among lakes are effectively zero, $m_{ij} \\approx 0$ for all lake pairs $i \\neq j$.\n-   **Genetic Drift:** Effective population sizes, $N_e$, are large, and genetic drift is considered negligible.\n-   **GMTC Processes:** The problem stipulates that two of the three core processes of the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution (GMTC) are present: (1) geographic selection mosaics and (2) a mix of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots. The third process, (3) trait remixing via gene flow and genetic drift, is explicitly stated to be absent.\n-   **Question:** The query asks to identify which predictions of the GMTC are expected to hold (\"persist\") and which are expected to be unsupported (\"fail\") in this specific system that lacks trait remixing.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem presents a hypothetical but biologically plausible scenario based on well-documented natural systems.\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in evolutionary biology, specifically the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution. The concepts used—selection gradients, gene flow ($m_{ij}$), genetic drift ($N_e$), hotspots, coldspots, and selection mosaics—are standard and well-defined in the field. The setup is a valid theoretical exploration.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of conditions ($m_{ij} \\approx 0$, negligible drift) and asks for the logical consequences within a specified theoretical framework (GMTC). A unique, meaningful solution can be deduced.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness:** The premises are internally consistent. The existence of a selection mosaic and hotspots/coldspots is a direct result of the stated stable, heterogeneous ecological contexts across isolated lakes. The absence of trait remixing is a direct consequence of the stated conditions of zero migration and negligible drift. The problem is self-contained.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a rigorous and well-formulated question in theoretical evolutionary ecology. A solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe GMTC framework posits three interacting processes that together shape the coevolutionary landscape. The problem requires us to analyze the consequences of having only the first two processes active.\n\n1.  **Processes that Persist and their Predictions:**\n    -   **Geographic Selection Mosaic:** The problem states that ecological contexts differ among lakes. This environmental heterogeneity is the fundamental driver of spatial variation in natural selection on the interacting species. This mosaic is the primary cause of the observed pattern of hotspots and coldspots. Therefore, the existence of a \"patchwork of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots\" is a direct and persistent consequence.\n    -   **Local Coevolutionary Dynamics:** Within each isolated lake, particularly the hotspots, strong reciprocal selection will operate. This local selection will drive the coevolution of hosts and parasites. Over time, this process is expected to lead to local adaptation, where parasites are better at infecting their local hosts, and hosts are better at resisting their local parasites. This creates a statistical association, or **positive within-lake covariance**, between the specific interaction traits of the co-occurring host and parasite populations. This is a core outcome of local coevolutionary arms races or matching-alleles dynamics, and it does not require gene flow between populations.\n\n2.  **Processes that are Absent and the Predictions that Fail:**\n    -   **Trait Remixing:** The problem explicitly removes this process by setting migration to zero ($m_{ij} \\approx 0$) and drift to be negligible. Trait remixing is the engine for several key large-scale GMTC predictions.\n    -   **Gene-Flow–Generated Trait Mismatches:** A key prediction of the full GMTC is that immigration can introduce alleles from populations with different selective histories. This can lead to local populations being \"mismatched\" to their current environment (e.g., hosts being susceptible to local parasites because of the influx of susceptible alleles from a coldspot). Without gene flow, this predicted source of maladaptation is eliminated.\n    -   **Broad Geographic Clines:** Smooth geographic gradients (clines) in allele or trait frequencies are often formed by a balance between spatially varying selection and the homogenizing effect of gene flow connecting populations along the gradient. Without migration to connect the isolated lakes, no such migration-selection balance can be established. Each lake evolves as an independent demographic and genetic unit, resulting in a discrete mosaic rather than a smooth cline.\n    -   **Rapid Geographic Turnover of Hotspots:** In the full GMTC, gene flow allows for the spread of novel coevolutionary adaptations (e.g., a new parasite infectivity allele or host resistance allele). The arrival of such an allele can rapidly shift the local coevolutionary dynamics, potentially turning a coldspot into a hotspot or altering the selective pressures within an existing hotspot. Without the \"remixing\" effect of gene flow, the status of a lake as a hotspot or coldspot will be determined primarily by its stable local ecological conditions and will not exhibit rapid turnover due to inter-population genetic exchange.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. Persist: spatial variation in selection generating a patchwork of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots, and positive within-lake covariance between host and parasite interaction traits in hotspots; Fail: predictions that rely on trait remixing, including gene-flow–generated trait mismatches across neighboring lakes, spatial clines caused by migration–selection balance, and rapid geographic turnover of hotspot locations due to allelic spread.**\n    This option correctly identifies that the selection mosaic and its consequences (hotspots/coldspots) will persist. It also correctly states that local reciprocal selection will lead to positive trait covariance within hotspots. Furthermore, it accurately lists the key GMTC predictions that depend on gene flow (trait mismatches, clines, hotspot turnover) and will therefore fail in this system. This aligns perfectly with the derivation. **Correct**.\n\n-   **B. Persist: migration-driven trait mismatches and geographically smooth clines in interaction traits even with $m_{ij} \\approx 0$; Fail: the hotspot–coldspot structure, because gene flow is necessary to produce coevolutionary hotspots.**\n    This option is incorrect on both counts. \"Migration-driven\" phenomena cannot persist when migration is zero. The failure of the hotspot–coldspot structure is also incorrect; these are generated by local selective differences, not by gene flow. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. Persist: maintenance of within-lake polymorphism for interaction traits via continual influx of alleles from other lakes; Fail: any geographic structure in trait matching, because without trait remixing local selection cannot generate spatial pattern.**\n    This is incorrect. The \"persist\" claim requires gene flow, which is absent. The \"fail\" claim is a fundamental error; local section is precisely what *generates* the geographic pattern (the mosaic) in the first place. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. Persist: all standard GMTC predictions (hotspots and coldspots, geographic selection mosaics, trait mismatches caused by immigration, broad clines in traits, and frequent turnover in hotspot locations); Fail: none, because the three processes are not jointly necessary.**\n    This is incorrect. It fails to recognize that a subset of predictions is entirely dependent on the process of trait remixing (gene flow). While the three processes may not be necessary for *any* pattern to emerge, they are jointly required for the *full suite* of predictions of the complete theory. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **E. Persist: isolation-by-distance clines in neutral markers and interaction traits arising from drift alone; Fail: positive covariance between interacting species’ traits within hotspots, because without remixing reciprocal selection cannot align traits locally.**\n    This is incorrect. The \"persist\" claim is invalid because the problem states drift is negligible. The \"fail\" claim is also incorrect; local reciprocal selection is exactly what generates positive covariance (local alignment of traits), and gene flow (remixing) often acts to disrupt this local pattern. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the GMTC framework and the specific conditions of the problem, Option A is the only logically sound conclusion.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It presents a standard exercise in theoretical quantitative genetics applied to the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. We will proceed with a rigorous derivation from first principles.\n\nThe immediate direction of selection on a quantitative trait is determined by the directional selection gradient, denoted by $\\beta$. The Price equation provides the fundamental basis for this concept. The change in a mean trait $\\bar{z}$ is given by $\\Delta \\bar{z} = \\text{Cov}(w, z) + \\text{E}(w \\Delta z)$, where $w$ is relative fitness, $z$ is the trait, $\\text{Cov}$ is covariance, and $\\text{E}$ is expectation. The problem specifies that transmission bias is negligible, so the second term, $\\text{E}(w \\Delta z)$, can be ignored. Under the assumption of weak selection, the change in the mean trait is well-approximated by $\\Delta \\bar{z} \\approx G \\beta_z$, where $G$ is the additive genetic variance for the trait. The selection gradient $\\beta_z$ is defined as the partial derivative of an individual's relative fitness with respect to their own trait value, evaluated at the population mean trait. We apply this definition to derive the selection gradients for species A and species B.\n\nLet us first consider species A. Let $z_A'$ denote the trait value of an individual in species A, while $z_A$ is the mean trait value for the entire species. The problem states that high gene flow homogenizes the trait mean across all $K$ patches. Therefore, the fitness of an individual with trait $z_A'$ is averaged across the landscape. The absolute fitness of this individual, $W_A(z_A', z_B)$, is the weighted average of its fitness in each patch $k$, where the weights are the patch frequencies $\\pi_k$. The fitness depends on the individual's trait $z_A'$ and the mean trait of the interacting species B, $z_B$.\n$$W_A(z_A', z_B) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k f_k(z_A', z_B)$$\nThe mean absolute fitness of the entire species A population, $\\bar{W}_A$, is found by evaluating $W_A(z_A', z_B)$ at the population mean trait value, $z_A' = z_A$.\n$$\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k f_k(z_A, z_B)$$\nThe relative fitness of an individual with trait $z_A'$ is its absolute fitness divided by the mean absolute fitness of the population.\n$$w_A(z_A') = \\frac{W_A(z_A', z_B)}{\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B)}$$\nThe directional selection gradient on trait $z_A$, denoted $\\beta_A$, is the partial derivative of this relative fitness function with respect to the individual's trait $z_A'$, evaluated at the population mean $z_A$.\n$$\\beta_A = \\frac{\\partial w_A(z_A')}{\\partial z_A'} \\bigg|_{z_A' = z_A}$$\nWe compute this derivative using the quotient rule. It is crucial to note that $\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B)$ is a function of the population mean trait $z_A$ and is therefore treated as a constant with respect to the individual trait variable $z_A'$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial w_A(z_A')}{\\partial z_A'} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_A'} \\left( \\frac{W_A(z_A', z_B)}{\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B)} \\frac{\\partial W_A(z_A', z_B)}{\\partial z_A'}$$\nThe derivative of the individual's absolute fitness is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial W_A(z_A', z_B)}{\\partial z_A'} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_A'} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k f_k(z_A', z_B) \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k \\frac{\\partial f_k(z_A', z_B)}{\\partial z_A'}$$\nEvaluating this at $z_A' = z_A$ gives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial W_A(z_A', z_B)}{\\partial z_A'} \\bigg|_{z_A' = z_A} = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k \\frac{\\partial f_k(z_A, z_B)}{\\partial z_A}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\beta_A$, we obtain:\n$$\\beta_A = \\frac{1}{\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B)} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k \\frac{\\partial f_k(z_A, z_B)}{\\partial z_A}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B)$:\n$$\\beta_A = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k \\frac{\\partial f_k(z_A, z_B)}{\\partial z_A}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k f_k(z_A, z_B)}$$\nThis is the selection gradient on trait $z_A$. It is the landscape-averaged selection pressure, normalized by the landscape-averaged mean fitness.\n\nThe derivation for species B follows an identical logic. Let $z_B'$ be the trait of an individual from species B, and $z_B$ be the population mean. The absolute fitness of this individual, $W_B(z_A, z_B')$, depends on its own trait and the mean trait of species A, $z_A$.\n$$W_B(z_A, z_B') = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k g_k(z_A, z_B')$$\nThe mean absolute fitness of the species B population is:\n$$\\bar{W}_B(z_A, z_B) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k g_k(z_A, z_B)$$\nThe relative fitness of the individual is $w_B(z_B') = W_B(z_A, z_B') / \\bar{W}_B(z_A, z_B)$. The selection gradient $\\beta_B$ is:\n$$\\beta_B = \\frac{\\partial w_B(z_B')}{\\partial z_B'} \\bigg|_{z_B' = z_B}$$\nFollowing the same steps as for species A:\n$$\\beta_B = \\frac{1}{\\bar{W}_B(z_A, z_B)} \\frac{\\partial W_B(z_A, z_B')}{\\partial z_B'} \\bigg|_{z_B' = z_B}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial W_B(z_A, z_B')}{\\partial z_B'} \\bigg|_{z_B' = z_B} = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k \\frac{\\partial g_k(z_A, z_B)}{\\partial z_B}$$\nSubstituting these expressions gives the final form for $\\beta_B$:\n$$\\beta_B = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k \\frac{\\partial g_k(z_A, z_B)}{\\partial z_B}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k g_k(z_A, z_B)}$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a row matrix $(\\beta_A, \\beta_B)$.

The problem specifies a linear relationship between relative fitness and a quantitative trait, $z$.\n\nFirst, we define relative fitness. For any individual $j$ in site $i$, its absolute fitness is $W_{ij}$. The mean absolute fitness for site $i$, which contains $n_i$ individuals, is given by:\n$$ \\bar{W}_i = \\frac{1}{n_i} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} W_{ij} $$\nRelative fitness, $w_{ij}$, is then defined as the individual's absolute fitness scaled by the site mean:\n$$ w_{ij} = \\frac{W_{ij}}{\\bar{W}_i} $$\nA critical property of relative fitness is that its sample mean within a site is always unity:\n$$ \\bar{w}_i = \\frac{1}{n_i} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} w_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n_i} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\frac{W_{ij}}{\\bar{W}_i} = \\frac{1}{n_i \\bar{W}_i} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} W_{ij} \\right) = \\frac{1}{n_i \\bar{W}_i} (n_i \\bar{W}_i) = 1 $$\n\nThe problem states that the relationship between relative fitness and the trait $z_{ij}$ is approximated by a linear model:\n$$ w_{ij} = \\alpha_i' + \\beta_i z_{ij} + e_{ij} $$\nwhere $\\beta_i$ is the directional selection gradient of interest. We are tasked with finding the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator for this slope, which we denote $\\hat{\\beta}_i$.\n\nThe general formula for the OLS slope estimator in a simple linear regression of a response variable $Y$ on a predictor variable $X$ is:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} (X_k - \\bar{X})(Y_k - \\bar{Y})}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} (X_k - \\bar{X})^2} $$\nFor our specific case in site $i$, we have $Y_j = w_{ij}$ and $X_j = z_{ij}$.

It is the sample covariance of the trait and absolute fitness, divided by the product of the mean absolute fitness and the sample variance of the trait (with a factor of $n_i - 1$ or $n_i$ in both numerator and denominator, which cancels).\n\nPart 2: Variance Partition of the Across-Site Selection Gradient, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\beta_i)$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires partitioning the across-site variance of the selection gradient, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\beta_i)$, based on the provided linear model:\n$$ \\beta_i = \\alpha + \\gamma_{E}\\,X_i + \\gamma_{Y}\\,y_i + \\varepsilon_i $$\nHere, $\\beta_i$, $X_i$, $y_i$, and $\\varepsilon_i$ are random variables representing variation across the $m$ sites, while $\\alpha$, $\\gamma_E$, and $\\gamma_Y$ are fixed coefficients. The residuals $\\varepsilon_i$ are independent with mean zero and constant variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_i)$, and are independent of the predictors $X_i$ and $y_i$.\n\nWe apply the variance operator to the equation for $\\beta_i$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\beta_i) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\alpha + \\gamma_{E}\\,X_i + \\gamma_{Y}\\,y_i + \\varepsilon_i) $$\nUsing the fundamental properties of variance:\n1.  The variance of a constant is zero, so $\\mathrm{Var}(\\alpha)=0$.\n2.  The variance of a sum of random variables $A$ and $B$ is $\\mathrm{Var}(A+B) = \\mathrm{Var}(A) + \\mathrm{Var}(B) + 2\\mathrm{Cov}(A,B)$.\n\nSince the error term $\\varepsilon_i$ is independent of both $X_i$ and $y_i$, it is also independent of any linear combination of them. Consequently, the covariance between $\\varepsilon_i$ and the other variable terms is zero:\n$$ \\mathrm{Cov}(\\gamma_{E}\\,X_i + \\gamma_{Y}\\,y_i, \\varepsilon_i) = 0 $$\nThis allows us to separate the variance of the error term:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\beta_i) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\gamma_{E}\\,X_i + \\gamma_{Y}\\,y_i) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_i) $$\nNext, we expand the first term using the rule for the variance of a weighted sum of correlated variables:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\gamma_{E}\\,X_i + \\gamma_{Y}\\,y_i) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\gamma_{E}\\,X_i) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\gamma_{Y}\\,y_i) + 2\\mathrm{Cov}(\\gamma_{E}\\,X_i, \\gamma_{Y}\\,y_i) $$\nUsing the property $\\mathrm{Var}(cA) = c^2\\mathrm{Var}(A)$ and $\\mathrm{Cov}(cA, dB) = cd\\mathrm{Cov}(A,B)$ for constants $c$ and $d$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\gamma_{E}\\,X_i + \\gamma_{Y}\\,y_i) = \\gamma_{E}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) + \\gamma_{Y}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Var}(y_i) + 2\\gamma_{E}\\gamma_{Y}\\mathrm{Cov}(X_i, y_i) $$\nCombining this result with the residual variance gives the complete partition:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\beta_i) = \\gamma_{E}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) + \\gamma_{Y}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Var}(y_i) + 2\\gamma_{E}\\gamma_{Y}\\mathrm{Cov}(X_i, y_i) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_i) $$\nThis expression partitions the total variance of the selection gradient as required:\n-   $\\gamma_{E}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Var}(X_i)$ is the ecological component, due to variation in the ecological driver $X_i$.\n-   $\\gamma_{Y}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Var}(y_i)$ is the evolutionary component, due to variation in the interactor trait $y_i$.\n-   $2\\gamma_{E}\\gamma_{Y}\\mathrm{Cov}(X_i, y_i)$ is the eco-evolutionary coupling term, arising from the statistical association between the ecological and evolutionary predictors.\n-   $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_i)$ is the residual variance, representing all other sources of variation not captured by the model.\n\nThis expression is the required closed-form partition.",
