            "problem": "Consider a haploid host and haploid parasite system with two host alleles, resistance $R$ and susceptibility $r$, and two parasite alleles, virulent $V$ and avirulent $a$. Assume a single round of viability selection per generation, deterministic dynamics in a very large population, no mutation, no migration, and that parasite allele frequencies are fixed during this host generation. Each host experiences a parasite encounter independently with probability $\\pi$, and conditional on encountering a parasite of genotype $P \\in \\{V,a\\}$, infection occurs with probability given by an infection matrix. If infection occurs, host reproductive output is multiplicatively reduced by a factor $(1 - s_{P})$ that depends on parasite genotype $P$. Hosts also incur genotype-specific baseline costs independent of infection.\n\nThe infection matrix $I$ is defined with host genotypes as rows $(R, r)$ and parasite genotypes as columns $(V, a)$:\n$$\nI \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nso that $I_{R,V} = 1$, $I_{R,a} = 0$, $I_{r,V} = 1$, and $I_{r,a} = 1$. Let the initial host resistance allele frequency be $p = 0.6$ (so the susceptibility allele frequency is $1 - p = 0.4$). Parasite allele frequencies are $q_{V} = 0.3$ and $q_{a} = 0.7$. The encounter probability is $\\pi = 0.8$. Infection by genotype $V$ reduces host reproductive output by factor $(1 - s_{V})$ with $s_{V} = 0.5$, and infection by genotype $a$ reduces host reproductive output by factor $(1 - s_{a})$ with $s_{a} = 0.7$. The resistance allele $R$ carries a baseline cost $c_{R} = 0.04$, while the susceptibility allele has no baseline cost $c_{r} = 0$.\n\nUsing only foundational definitions from population genetics (viability selection in haploids, average fitness, and allele frequency change under selection), compute the expected one-generation change in the resistance allele frequency $\\Delta p = p' - p$, where $p'$ is the post-selection allele frequency. Express your final numerical answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the one-generation change in the frequency of a host resistance allele, $\\Delta p$. This is a problem of viability selection in a haploid population. We begin from foundational principles.\n\nLet $p$ be the initial frequency of the resistance allele $R$, and $1-p$ be the frequency of the susceptibility allele $r$. Let $W_R$ and $W_r$ denote the absolute fitness (viability) of the host genotypes $R$ and $r$, respectively. The mean fitness of the population before selection is given by the weighted average of the genotype fitnesses:\n$$\n\\bar{W} = p W_R + (1-p) W_r\n$$\nAfter one round of viability selection, the frequency of the $R$ allele, denoted $p'$, is:\n$$\np' = \\frac{p W_R}{\\bar{W}}\n$$\nThe change in allele frequency is therefore $\\Delta p = p' - p$. Substituting the expressions for $p'$ and $\\bar{W}$ yields the standard equation for frequency change under selection:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{p W_R}{p W_R + (1-p) W_r} - p = \\frac{p(1-p)(W_R - W_r)}{p W_R + (1-p) W_r}\n$$\nTo proceed, we must first derive the fitness expressions for $W_R$ and $W_r$ from the given parameters. The fitness of a host genotype is determined by its baseline fitness, which may be reduced by costs of infection. The baseline fitness for a host with genotype $i \\in \\{R, r\\}$ is given by $1-c_i$. Infection, if it occurs, multiplicatively reduces reproductive output.\n\nThe total fitness $W_i$ can be expressed as the product of the baseline fitness component and the component related to parasite-induced selection. Let $F_i$ be the expected reproductive output factor for a host of genotype $i$. Then $W_i = (1 - c_i) F_i$. An individual's reproductive output is reduced by a factor $(1-s_P)$ upon infection by parasite genotype $P$. The expected output factor is an average over all outcomes (no encounter, encounter with $V$, encounter with $a$):\n$$\nF_i = (1-\\pi) \\cdot 1 + \\pi q_V \\cdot (1 - I_{i,V} s_V) + \\pi q_a \\cdot (1 - I_{i,a} s_a)\n$$\nwhere $\\pi$ is the encounter probability, $q_P$ is the frequency of parasite genotype $P$, and $I_{i,P}$ is the probability of infection given an encounter between host $i$ and parasite $P$. Simplifying this expression:\n$$\nF_i = 1 - \\pi + \\pi q_V - \\pi q_V I_{i,V} s_V + \\pi q_a - \\pi q_a I_{i,a} s_a = 1 - \\pi + \\pi(q_V+q_a) - \\pi(q_V I_{i,V} s_V + q_a I_{i,a} s_a)\n$$\nSince $q_V + q_a = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nF_i = 1 - \\pi(q_V I_{i,V} s_V + q_a I_{i,a} s_a)\n$$\nNow, we compute $W_R$ and $W_r$.\n\nFor the resistant host genotype $R$:\nThe baseline cost is $c_R = 0.04$.

It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\nThe objective is to find the value of virulence $\\alpha$ that maximizes the basic reproduction number $R_{0}(\\alpha)$. First, we substitute the expression for the transmission rate $\\beta(\\alpha)$ into the equation for $R_{0}(\\alpha)$:\n$$\nR_{0}(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\frac{k \\alpha}{1 + c \\alpha}}{\\alpha + \\gamma} = \\frac{k \\alpha}{(1 + c \\alpha)(\\alpha + \\gamma)}\n$$\nTo find the maximum of this function, we must find its critical points by calculating the first derivative with respect to $\\alpha$ and setting it to zero. We apply the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{d\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, where $u(\\alpha) = k\\alpha$ and $v(\\alpha) = (1 + c\\alpha)(\\alpha + \\gamma)$.\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of $u$ and $v$:\n$$\nu'(\\alpha) = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha}(k\\alpha) = k\n$$\nTo find $v'(\\alpha)$, we first expand $v(\\alpha)$:\n$$\nv(\\alpha) = \\alpha + \\gamma + c\\alpha^2 + c\\gamma\\alpha = c\\alpha^2 + (1 + c\\gamma)\\alpha + \\gamma\n$$\nNow, we differentiate $v(\\alpha)$:\n$$\nv'(\\alpha) = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha}(c\\alpha^2 + (1 + c\\gamma)\\alpha + \\gamma) = 2c\\alpha + 1 + c\\gamma\n$$\nNow we apply the quotient rule to find $\\frac{dR_{0}}{d\\alpha}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{0}}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{k[(1 + c\\alpha)(\\alpha + \\gamma)] - (k\\alpha)[2c\\alpha + 1 + c\\gamma]}{[(1 + c\\alpha)(\\alpha + \\gamma)]^2}\n$$\nFor a critical point, we set the derivative equal to zero.
