            "problem": "In a large, panmictic, hermaphroditic diploid plant population, consider the formation of zygotes in a single reproductive season. Each individual produces both male and female gametes. During gametogenesis, each gamete independently fails meiosis and is unreduced (ploidy $2n$) with probability $u \\in [0,1]$, and is reduced (ploidy $n$) with probability $1-u$. A fraction $s \\in [0,1]$ of zygotes are formed by self-fertilization of a single individual, and the remaining fraction $1-s$ are formed by random mating between different individuals. Assume:\n- Independence of gametogenesis events within and across individuals (male and female meioses are independent even within the same parent).\n- Zygote ploidy is the sum of parental gamete ploidies.\n- Only the union of two unreduced gametes yields an autotetraploid ($4n$) zygote in this setting. Other pathways to $4n$ (for example, somatic doubling post-zygotically) are absent.\n- All zygotes with compatible ploidy class considered here are viable at the point of formation.\n\nUsing the basic principles of meiotic segregation and the law of total probability, derive the expected fraction $R_{4n}(u,s)$ of newly formed zygotes that are autotetraploid in terms of $u$ and $s$.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters ($u$, $s$) and a clear objective. The language is objective and precise. The assumptions, such as the independence of meiotic failure, are explicitly stated, making the problem self-contained and consistent. The model is a simplification of a real biological process but does not violate fundamental principles or contain factual unsoundness. It is a formalizable problem requiring the application of basic probability theory.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to determine the expected fraction of newly formed zygotes that are autotetraploid, which we denote as $R_{4n}(u,s)$. The problem states that an autotetraploid ($4n$) zygote is formed only by the fusion of two unreduced ($2n$) gametes. The probability for any single gamete to be unreduced is given as $u$.\n\nWe can approach this using the law of total probability. The formation of a zygote can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive events:\n1.  Self-fertilization (event $S$), which occurs with probability $P(S) = s$.\n2.  Outcrossing or random mating (event $O$), which occurs with probability $P(O) = 1-s$.\n\nLet $Z_{4n}$ be the event that a zygote is autotetraploid. The total probability of this event is the sum of its probabilities conditioned on the mode of fertilization, weighted by the probabilities of those modes:\n$$\nR_{4n}(u,s) = P(Z_{4n}) = P(Z_{4n} | S) P(S) + P(Z_{4n} | O) P(O)\n$$\nWe must now determine the conditional probabilities $P(Z_{4n} | S)$ and $P(Z_{4n} | O)$.\n\nCase 1: Self-fertilization (conditioned on event $S$)\nIn this case, a single parent individual provides both the male and female gametes. A $4n$ zygote results if and only if both of these gametes are unreduced ($2n$). Let $M_{2n}$ be the event that the male gamete is unreduced, and $F_{2n}$ be the event that the female gamete is unreduced. The probability of each event is $P(M_{2n}) = u$ and $P(F_{2n}) = u$.\nThe problem explicitly states that \"male and female meioses are independent even within the same parent\". Therefore, the probability that both gametes from a single self-fertilizing parent are unreduced is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$\nP(Z_{4n} | S) = P(M_{2n} \\cap F_{2n} | S) = P(M_{2n} | S) \\cdot P(F_{2n} | S) = u \\cdot u = u^{2}\n$$\n\nCase 2: Outcrossing (conditioned on event $O$)\nIn this case, the zygote is formed from gametes produced by two different individuals, chosen randomly from the population. One individual provides the male gamete, and another provides the female gamete. Again, for a $4n$ zygote to form, both gametes must be unreduced ($2n$).\nThe problem states that gametogenesis events are independent \"across individuals\". The probability that a gamete from any randomly chosen individual is unreduced is $u$. Thus, the probability that the male gamete from one parent is unreduced is $u$, and the probability that the female gamete from the other parent is unreduced is also $u$. Due to their independence, the joint probability is:\n$$\nP(Z_{4n} | O) = P(M_{2n} \\cap F_{2n} | O) = P(M_{2n} | O) \\cdot P(F_{2n} | O) = u \\cdot u = u^{2}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these conditional probabilities back into the formula for total probability:\n$$\nR_{4n}(u,s) = P(Z_{4n} | S) \\cdot s + P(Z_{4n} | O) \\cdot (1-s)\n$$\n$$\nR_{4n}(u,s) = u^{2} \\cdot s + u^{2} \\cdot (1-s)\n$$\nFactoring out the term $u^{2}$:\n$$\nR_{4n}(u,s) = u^{2} (s + (1-s))\n$$\n$$\nR_{4n}(u,s) = u^{2} (1)\n$$\n$$\nR_{4n}(u,s) = u^{2}\n$$\nThe result shows that, under the strict independence assumption provided in the problem, the fraction of newly formed autotetraploid zygotes is independent of the selfing rate $s$. The probability of forming a $4n$ zygote is simply the probability of two independent meiotic failure events occurring, one for each gamete contributing to the zygote, regardless of whether the gametes originate from one or two parents.",

It employs the standard Wright-Fisher model and extends it to polyploidy, a valid and important topic in evolutionary biology. The assumptions of additive fitness, weak selection, large population size, and specific meiotic behavior (tetrasomic inheritance, no double reduction) are standard in the field for deriving analytical approximations.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The question asks for the fixation probability of a new mutation, which is a well-defined quantity for which established theoretical frameworks exist. The provided information is sufficient to derive a unique answer.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n- **Consistency and Completeness**: The problem statement is internally consistent and provides all necessary parameters and conditions for its solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed by deriving the fixation probabilities from first principles.\n\n**Derivation of Fixation Probability**\n\nThe fixation probability of a single, new, beneficial mutation in a large population can be approximated using a branching process model. The key quantity is the expected number of copies of the mutant allele in the next generation, descended from the single initial copy. Let this expectation be $E[C_1]$. The probability of ultimate fixation, $u$, is given by the survival probability of the branching process, which for a nearly neutral allele (weak selection) where offspring number is approximately Poisson-distributed, is $u \\approx 2(E[C_1] - 1)$. This assumes the wild-type allele has a replacement rate of exactly $1$.\n\nThe initial mutation arises in a single individual, which therefore carries one copy of allele $A$ and $k-1$ copies of allele $a$. The number of $A$ copies in this individual is $k_A=1$.\n\nThe relative fitness of this initial carrier is given by the fitness function $w(k_A=1) = 1 + \\frac{1}{k}s$.\nThe average fitness of the population is $\\bar{w}$. Since the mutation is rare, the population consists almost entirely of resident homozygotes ($aaaa...$) with fitness $w(0)=1$. Thus, $\\bar{w} \\approx 1$.\n\nAn individual is expected to produce a number of successful offspring proportional to its relative fitness. In a stable population of size $N$ with ploidy $k$, each individual produces on average $2$ gametes of ploidy $k/2$ that contribute to the next generation of $N$ individuals. The expected number of gametes contributed by the initial mutant carrier is $2 \\times \\frac{w(k_A=1)}{\\bar{w}} \\approx 2(1 + \\frac{s}{k})$.\n\nNext, we must determine the expected number of $A$ alleles passed on through these gametes. In an autopolyploid with ploidy $k$ and random chromosomal pairing (and no double reduction), an individual with one copy of $A$ produces gametes of ploidy $k/2$. The probability that a gamete contains the single $A$ allele is the ratio of ways to choose the $A$ chromosome plus $k/2-1$ other chromosomes, to the total ways to choose $k/2$ chromosomes from $k$:\n$$\nP(A \\in \\text{gamete}) = \\frac{\\binom{k-1}{k/2-1}}{\\binom{k}{k/2}} = \\frac{\\frac{(k-1)!}{(\\frac{k}{2}-1)!(k-\\frac{k}{2})!}}{\\frac{k!}{(\\frac{k}{2})!(\\frac{k}{2})!}} = \\frac{(k-1)!}{(\\frac{k}{2}-1)!(\\frac{k}{2})!} \\times \\frac{(\\frac{k}{2})!(\\frac{k}{2})!}{k!} = \\frac{k/2}{k} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis probability is $1/2$ for any even ploidy $k \\ge 2$. Each gamete that receives the $A$ allele contains exactly one copy of it.\n\nThe expected number of copies of allele $A$ in the next generation, $E[C_1]$, is the product of the expected number of gametes produced by the carrier and the probability that a gamete contains the $A$ allele:\n$$\nE[C_1] = 2\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{k}\\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1 + \\frac{s}{k}\n$$\nThe fixation probability, $u_k$, for a ploidy level $k$ is therefore:\n$$\nu_k \\approx 2(E[C_1] - 1) = 2\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{k} - 1\\right) = \\frac{2s}{k}\n$$\n\n**Applying the Formula to Diploid and Autotetraploid Populations**\n\n1.  **Diploid Population (Population D, $k=2$)**:\n    The fixation probability is:\n    $$\n    u_{\\mathrm{dip}} = u_2 = \\frac{2s}{2} = s\n    $$\n\n2.  **Autotetraploid Population (Population T, $k=4$)**:\n    The fixation probability is:\n    $$\n    u_{\\mathrm{tet}} = u_4 = \\frac{2s}{4} = \\frac{s}{2}\n    $$\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nOur derived results are $u_{\\mathrm{dip}} \\approx s$ and $u_{\\mathrm{tet}} \\approx s/2$. We now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. $u_{\\mathrm{dip}}\\approx s$ and $u_{\\mathrm{tet}}\\approx \\dfrac{s}{2}$, because the single-copy carrier has advantage $s/2$ in diploids but only $s/4$ in autotetraploids, so the initial selective advantage is diluted across four copies (dosage masking).**\n- The calculated probabilities $u_{\\mathrm{dip}}\\approx s$ and $u_{\\mathrm{tet}}\\approx s/2$ are correct.\n- The reasoning is also correct. The selective advantage of the initial carrier (heterozygote) is $s_{\\text{het}} = w(1) - w(0) = (1+s/k) - 1 = s/k$.\n- For diploids ($k=2$), the advantage is $s_{\\text{het, dip}} = s/2$.\n- For autotetraploids ($k=4$), the advantage is $s_{\\text{het, tet}} = s/4$.\n- The fixation probability $u_k = 2s/k = 2(s/k) = 2s_{\\text{het}, k}$. The probability is directly proportional to the heterozygote's selective advantage.\n- The reduction in advantage from $s/2$ to $s/4$ is due to the larger number of alleles in the tetraploid genotype, a phenomenon correctly identified as \"dosage masking\" or dilution.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. $u_{\\mathrm{dip}}\\approx 2s$ and $u_{\\mathrm{tet}}\\approx s$, because the extra gene copies in autotetraploids halve the per-copy effect but do not change the diploid fixation probability.**\n- The fixation probabilities are incorrect. A diploid fixation probability of $2s$ corresponds to a mutation with full dominance, not additive effects as specified. The tetraploid probability is also incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. $u_{\\mathrm{dip}}\\approx s$ and $u_{\\mathrm{tet}}\\approx s$, because the lower initial allele frequency in autotetraploids is offset by stronger selection on dosage classes, yielding no net difference.**\n- The tetraploid fixation probability $u_{\\mathrm{tet}}\\approx s$ is incorrect.\n- The reasoning is flawed. The initial allele frequency is indeed lower in the tetraploid population ($1/(4N)$ vs. $1/(2N)$), but selection on the initial carrier is *weaker* ($s/4$), not stronger. There is no such offsetting effect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. $u_{\\mathrm{dip}}\\approx \\dfrac{s}{2}$ and $u_{\\text{tet}}\\approx \\dfrac{s}{4}$, because fixation probability is proportional to the initial allele frequency in the population ($1/(2N)$ versus $1/(4N)$), not to the fitness of the initial carrier.**\n- The stated fixation probabilities are incorrect. They are the selective advantages ($s/2$ and $s/4$), not the fixation probabilities themselves ($s$ and $s/2$).\n- The reasoning is fundamentally incorrect. The fixation probability of a beneficial mutation is primarily determined by its selective advantage, not its initial frequency (which determines the neutral fixation probability). The claim that fitness is not relevant is false.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. $u_{\\mathrm{dip}}\\approx s$ and $u_{\\mathrm{tet}}\\approx 2s$, because carrying more copies in autotetraploids immediately exposes the mutation to stronger selection (reduced masking).**\n- The tetraploid fixation probability $u_{\\mathrm{tet}}\\approx 2s$ is incorrect.\n- The reasoning is the opposite of what is true. Higher ploidy leads to *increased* masking (weaker selection on the initial carrier), not reduced masking.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**",

For each population $i$ you are given an integer chromosome count $c_i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and a symmetric matrix of pairwise crossing fertility $F \\in [0,1]^{N \\times N}$ where $F_{ij}$ quantifies the relative fertility of crosses between populations $i$ and $j$ on a unitless scale from $0$ to $1$ (with $1$ indicating full fertility equal to within-population crosses). The goal is to implement a mathematically rigorous decision pipeline to infer whether the data are most consistent with a polyploid speciation event and to exclude explanations based on aneuploidy or chromosomal polymorphism.\n\nFundamental biological bases to be used:\n- Whole-genome duplication implies that chromosome counts across diverged cytotypes scale by integer ploidy factors. Mathematically, there exists a base count $g \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and integer multipliers $m_i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $c_i \\approx m_i g$ for each $i$.\n- Crossing fertility between different ploidy levels is typically highly reduced, while crosses within the same ploidy level are often fertile. Therefore, fertility is expected to be high within groups that share the same inferred multiplier $m_i$ and low between groups with distinct $m_i$.\n- Aneuploidy implies small deviations (for example, $\\pm 1$) from otherwise similar counts without the integer multiple structure across groups, often not accompanied by a strong, discrete fertility separation by chromosome count.\n- Chromosomal polymorphism (for example, structural rearrangements) can reduce fertility despite identical or nearly identical chromosome counts and can create a pattern of high fertility within clades and low fertility between clades, even when all $c_i$ are equal (or nearly equal).\n\nDesign and implement a program that, for each test case, applies the following logic formulated purely in mathematical terms:\n\n- Ploidy-model fit by integer-lattice approximation:\n  - For candidate base counts $g \\in \\{2,3,\\dots,\\min_i c_i\\}$, define integer multipliers by $m_i(g) = \\max\\{1, \\operatorname{round}(c_i / g)\\}$ and residuals $r_i(g) = |c_i - m_i(g) \\cdot g|$ for all $i$.\n  - Let the mean absolute residual be $\\bar{r}(g) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N r_i(g)$.\n  - Define the best-fitting base count $g^\\star$ as a minimizer of $\\bar{r}(g)$ over the candidate set.\n  - Accept the ploidy-model fit if $\\bar{r}(g^\\star) \\le \\delta$ and the inferred multipliers $\\{m_i(g^\\star)\\}$ produce at least two distinct groups.\n\n- Fertility separation test given the inferred multipliers:\n  - Using the partition induced by $m_i(g^\\star)$, define the within-group fertility mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{within}}$ as the average of $F_{ij}$ over all unordered pairs $(i,j)$ with $i < j$ such that $m_i(g^\\star) = m_j(g^\\star)$, and the between-group fertility mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{between}}$ as the average of $F_{ij}$ over all unordered pairs $(i,j)$ with $i < j$ such that $m_i(g^\\star) \\ne m_j(g^\\star)$.\n  - Accept fertility separation if there is at least one within-group pair and at least one between-group pair and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{within}} \\ge \\theta_w$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{between}} \\le \\theta_b$.\n\n- Chromosomal polymorphism alternative:\n  - If the ploidy-model acceptance fails or the fertility separation test fails, check if the chromosome counts are nearly identical: $\\max_i c_i - \\min_i c_i \\le 1$.\n  - If nearly identical, determine whether there exists a bipartition of the populations into two nonempty groups that yields a within-versus-between fertility separation with the same thresholds as above.

The $\\operatorname{round}$ function maps a real number to the nearest integer, with halves rounded to the nearest even integer. The $\\max\\{1, \\dots\\}$ ensures multipliers are at least $1$.\n2.  Residuals $r_i(g) = |c_i - m_i(g) \\cdot g|$.\n3.  The mean absolute residual $\\bar{r}(g) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N r_i(g)$.\n\nThe optimal base count, $g^\\star$, is defined as a minimizer of $\\bar{r}(g)$. Should multiple values of $g$ yield the same minimal $\\bar{r}(g)$, we select the largest among them as $g^\\star$.\n\nThe ploidy model is accepted if two conditions are met:\n1.  The minimal mean residual does not exceed a tolerance $\\delta$: $\\bar{r}(g^\\star) \\le \\delta$. For this problem, $\\delta=1.0$.\n2.  The set of inferred multipliers, $\\{m_i(g^\\star)\\}_{i=1}^N$, contains at least two distinct values, implying a ploidy difference among populations.\n\n**Step 2: Fertility Separation Test**\nIf the ploidy model is accepted, we test if the inferred ploidy groups correspond to reproductive isolation, as indicated by the fertility matrix $F$.\nUsing the population partition induced by the multipliers $m_i(g^\\star)$, we calculate two metrics:\n1.  The mean within-group fertility, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{within}}$: the average of $F_{ij}$ over all unordered pairs $(i,j)$ with $i<j$ where populations $i$ and $j$ have the same multiplier ($m_i(g^\\star) = m_j(g^\\star)$).\n2.  The mean between-group fertility, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{between}}$: the average of $F_{ij}$ over all unordered pairs $(i,j)$ with $i<j$ where populations $i$ and $j$ have different multipliers ($m_i(g^\\star) \\ne m_j(g^\\star)$).\n\nThe fertility separation test is passed if there is at least one pair of populations for the within-group calculation and at least one for the between-group calculation, and the means satisfy the following conditions: $\\mu_{\\mathrm{within}} \\ge \\theta_w$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{between}} \\le \\theta_b$. For this problem, the thresholds are $\\theta_w=0.7$ and $\\theta_b=0.2$.\n\nIf both the ploidy-model fit and the fertility separation test are accepted, the case is classified as polyploid speciation (output $2$).\n\n**Step 3: Chromosomal Polymorphism Alternative**\nIf the criteria for polyploid speciation are not fully met (i.e., the ploidy model fit or the fertility test failed), we evaluate an alternative hypothesis: chromosomal polymorphism causing reproductive isolation without significant changes in chromosome number.\nThis check is performed only if the chromosome counts are nearly identical across all populations, defined by the condition $\\max_i c_i - \\min_i c_i \\le 1$.\n\nIf this condition holds, we search for evidence of reproductive isolation by searching through all possible non-trivial bipartitions of the set of populations into two non-empty groups, $A$ and $B$. For each bipartition $\\{A, B\\}$, we compute:\n1.  The pooled within-group fertility: the average of $F_{ij}$ over all pairs $(i,j)$ with $i,j$ both in $A$ or both in $B$ ($i<j$).\n2.  The between-group fertility: the average of $F_{ij}$ over all pairs $(i,j)$ with $i \\in A$ and $j \\in B$.\n\nIf there exists at least one bipartition for which the pooled within-group mean is at least $\\theta_w=0.7$ and the between-group mean is at most $\\theta_b=0.2$, the chromosomal polymorphism explanation is accepted. The classification is then chromosomal polymorphism (output $1$). The search over partitions can be done exhaustively, as the number of populations $N$ is small.\n\n**Step 4: Final Classification**\nThe final output for each test case is determined by the sequential application of the rules:\n- If the ploidy model and subsequent fertility test are both passed, the result is $2$.\n- Otherwise, if the chromosomal polymorphism alternative is accepted, the result is $1$.\n- Otherwise, the result is $0$, indicating the data is most consistent with other phenomena like aneuploidy or that the provided models do not fit well.\n\nThis comprehensive, step-by-step procedure provides a rigorous and objective classification for each test case based on the provided data and principles.",
