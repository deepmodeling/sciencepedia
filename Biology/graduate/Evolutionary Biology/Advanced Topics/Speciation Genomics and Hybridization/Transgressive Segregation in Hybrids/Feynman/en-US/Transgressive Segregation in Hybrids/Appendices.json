This practice problem models a trait controlled by just two unlinked, additive loci . By meticulously tracking the alleles from two complementary parental lines through the $F_1$ to the $F_2$ generation, you will derive the complete distribution of phenotypes and calculate the precise probability of producing offspring that outperform both parents, revealing the fundamental engine of transgressive segregation.",

            "problem": "Consider a quantitative trait determined by two unlinked, biallelic, additive loci under Mendelian segregation and independent assortment. Let the genotypic values at locus 1 be $+a$, $0$, and $-a$ for the homozygote for the favorable allele, the heterozygote, and the homozygote for the unfavorable allele, respectively. Similarly, let the genotypic values at locus 2 be $+b$, $0$, and $-b$ in the same order. Assume $a>0$ and $b>0$, no dominance, no epistasis, and an environmental contribution that is identically zero (deterministic phenotype given genotype). Two parental lines are fixed for opposite favorable alleles: parent $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ has genotype $AA$ at locus $1$ and $bb$ at locus $2$, while parent $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ has genotype $aa$ at locus $1$ and $BB$ at locus $2$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental principles of Mendelian inheritance (segregation and independent assortment) and the additive genotype–phenotype map specified above, derive the complete second filial generation ($F_2$) phenotypic probability mass function for the cross $\\mathcal{P}_{1}\\times \\mathcal{P}_{2}$ via the $F_1$. Then, using this distribution, compute the exact probability that a randomly sampled $F_2$ individual exhibits a phenotypic value strictly greater than both parental phenotypes (i.e., strictly greater than $\\max\\{a-b,\\;b-a\\}$). Express the final probability as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $a$ and $b$ only. No rounding is required, and no units are needed.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is a well-defined exercise in classical quantitative genetics. It adheres to established principles of Mendelian inheritance and additive gene action. The parameters are clearly specified, and the question is unambiguous. The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. Therefore, we proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe quantitative trait is determined by two unlinked, biallelic loci. The model is purely additive, with genotypic contributions of $+a$, $0$, and $-a$ at locus $1$ and $+b$, $0$, and $-b$ at locus $2$, for genotypes $AA/Aa/aa$ and $BB/Bb/bb$ respectively. We are given $a>0$ and $b>0$.\n\nThe two parental lines are $\\mathcal{P}_1$ with genotype $AA/bb$ and $\\mathcal{P}_2$ with genotype $aa/BB$. Their respective phenotypes, $P_1$ and $P_2$, are calculated by summing the contributions from each locus:\n$$P_1 = (+a) + (-b) = a-b$$\n$$P_2 = (-a) + (+b) = b-a$$\n\nThe $F_1$ generation results from the cross $\\mathcal{P}_1 \\times \\mathcal{P}_2$. All $F_1$ individuals will have the dihybrid genotype $Aa/Bb$. Their phenotype, $P_{F1}$, is:\n$$P_{F1} = (0) + (0) = 0$$\n\nThe $F_2$ generation is produced by an $F_1$ intercross: $Aa/Bb \\times Aa/Bb$. Due to Mendelian segregation and independent assortment, the genotypes at each locus in the $F_2$ generation follow classic ratios:\n- At locus 1 ($Aa \\times Aa$): The genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ appear with probabilities $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\frac{1}{4}$, giving phenotypic contributions of $+a$, $0$, and $-a$.\n- At locus 2 ($Bb \\times Bb$): The genotypes $BB$, $Bb$, and $bb$ appear with probabilities $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\frac{1}{4}$, giving phenotypic contributions of $+b$, $0$, and $-b$.\n\nSince the loci are unlinked, the joint probability of any two-locus genotype is the product of the single-locus genotype probabilities. This allows us to construct the complete phenotypic probability mass function for the $F_2$ generation. The $3 \\times 3 = 9$ possible genotypes, their probabilities, and their resultant phenotypic values ($P_{F2}$) are tabulated below.\n\n| Locus 1 | Locus 2 | Genotype | Probability | Phenotype ($P_{F2}$) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $AA$ | $BB$ | $AA/BB$ | $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$ | $a+b$ |\n| $AA$ | $Bb$ | $AA/Bb$ | $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{16}$ | $a$ |\n| $AA$ | $bb$ | $AA/bb$ | $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$ | $a-b$ |\n| $Aa$ | $BB$ | $Aa/BB$ | $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{16}$ | $b$ |\n| $Aa$ | $Bb$ | $Aa/Bb$ | $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{4}{16}$ | $0$ |\n| $Aa$ | $bb$ | $Aa/bb$ | $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{16}$ | $-b$ |\n| $aa$ | $BB$ | $aa/BB$ | $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$ | $b-a$ |\n| $aa$ | $Bb$ | $aa/Bb$ | $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{16}$ | $-a$ |\n| $aa$ | $bb$ | $aa/bb$ | $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$ | $-a-b$ |\n\nThis table constitutes the $F_2$ phenotypic probability mass function, as required by the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the probability that a randomly sampled $F_2$ individual exhibits a phenotype strictly greater than both parental phenotypes. This is the phenomenon of transgressive segregation. The mathematical condition is $P_{F2} > \\max\\{P_1, P_2\\}$.\nThe maximum parental phenotype is $\\max\\{a-b, b-a\\}$, which is equivalent to the absolute value $|a-b|$. So, we must find the probability $P(P_{F2} > |a-b|)$.\n\nWe will examine which of the nine genotypic classes in the $F_2$ generation satisfy this condition.\n1.  **Phenotype $a+b$ (Genotype $AA/BB$, Prob. $\\frac{1}{16}$)**: We must check if $a+b > |a-b|$. Since $a>0$ and $b>0$, $a+b$ is positive. Squaring both sides of the inequality gives $(a+b)^2 > (a-b)^2$, which expands to $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 > a^2 - 2ab + b^2$. This simplifies to $4ab > 0$, which is always true since $a>0$ and $b>0$. Thus, the genotype $AA/BB$ always produces a transgressive phenotype. Its contribution to the total probability is $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\n2.  **Phenotype $a$ (Genotype $AA/Bb$, Prob. $\\frac{2}{16}$)**: We must check if $a > |a-b|$. Again, since $a>0$, we can square both sides: $a^2 > (a-b)^2 \\implies a^2 > a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \\implies 2ab > b^2$. Since $b>0$, we can divide by $b$ to obtain $2a > b$. Therefore, this genotypic class contributes to the transgressive probability if and only if $2a > b$. The contribution is $\\frac{2}{16}$ if $2a>b$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n3.  **Phenotype $b$ (Genotype $Aa/BB$, Prob. $\\frac{2}{16}$)**: We must check if $b > |a-b|$. By symmetry with the previous case (swapping $a$ and $b$), this inequality holds if and only if $2b > a$. The contribution is $\\frac{2}{16}$ if $2b>a$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n4.  **Other Phenotypes**:\n    - For $a-b$: $a-b > |a-b|$ is impossible, as a value cannot be strictly greater than its absolute value if it is real.\n    - For $b-a$: Similarly, $b-a > |a-b|$ is impossible.\n    - For $0$: $0 > |a-b|$ is impossible since $|a-b| \\ge 0$.\n    - For negative phenotypes ($-a, -b, -a-b$): A negative value cannot be strictly greater than the non-negative value $|a-b|$.\n\nThe total probability of transgression is the sum of the probabilities of the qualifying genotypes. Let $I(\\cdot)$ be the indicator function, which is $1$ if its argument is true and $0$ if its argument is false. The total probability $P_T$ is:\n$$P_T = P(P_{F2}=a+b) + P(P_{F2}=a) \\cdot I(a > |a-b|) + P(P_{F2}=b) \\cdot I(b > |a-b|)$$\nSubstituting the probabilities and conditions:\n$$P_T = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{2}{16} \\cdot I(2a > b) + \\frac{2}{16} \\cdot I(2b > a)$$\nWe can express this result as a piecewise function of the ratio $\\frac{a}{b}$.\n\n- **Case 1: $\\frac{1}{2} < \\frac{a}{b} < 2$**. This is equivalent to $b < 2a$ and $a < 2b$. In this case, both indicator functions are $1$.\n$$P_T = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{2}{16}(1) + \\frac{2}{16}(1) = \\frac{5}{16}$$\n\n- **Case 2: $\\frac{a}{b} \\ge 2$ or $\\frac{a}{b} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$**.\n  - If $\\frac{a}{b} \\ge 2$, then $a \\ge 2b$. The condition $2a>b$ is true ($I=1$), but $2b>a$ is false ($I=0$).\n  $$P_T = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{2}{16}(1) + \\frac{2}{16}(0) = \\frac{3}{16}$$\n  - If $\\frac{a}{b} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, then $b \\ge 2a$. The condition $2a>b$ is false ($I=0$), but $2b>a$ is true ($I=1$).\n  $$P_T = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{2}{16}(0) + \\frac{2}{16}(1) = \\frac{3}{16}$$\nIn both subcases, the probability is $\\frac{3}{16}$. The strict inequalities in our derivation $2a>b$ and $2b>a$ mean that at the boundaries ($a=2b$ or $b=2a$), the respective indicator function is $0$, placing the boundary cases correctly into the $\\frac{3}{16}$ category.\n\nThus, the final probability is a piecewise function dependent on the relative magnitudes of $a$ and $b$.",

            "problem": "Two homozygous parental lines, denoted $P_1$ and $P_2$, differ at $k$ unlinked, biallelic loci $\\{L_{1},\\dots,L_{k}\\}$. At each locus $L_{i}$ there is a “positive” allele $A_{i}$ and an alternative “negative” allele $a_{i}$. Assume an additive dosage model in which each copy of $A_{i}$ contributes $+1$ unit to the trait and each copy of $a_{i}$ contributes $0$ units, independently across loci and without dominance or epistasis beyond additivity. Further assume Mendelian segregation, independent assortment, and no segregation distortion or viability selection.\n\nThe parents are complementary with respect to the positive alleles: $P_1$ is fixed for the positive allele ($A_{i}A_{i}$) at exactly $s$ loci (call this subset $S \\subset \\{1,\\dots,k\\}$ with $|S|=s$) and fixed for the negative allele ($a_{i}a_{i}$) at the remaining $k-s$ loci; $P_2$ is fixed for the negative allele at the loci in $S$ and fixed for the positive allele at the remaining $k-s$ loci.

The additive genetic model is a standard, albeit simplified, model used in quantitative genetics. The scenario describes the genetic basis of transgressive segregation, a well-documented phenomenon in evolutionary biology and breeding. The premises are scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is specified with sufficient clarity. The genetic model, parental genotypes, and crossing scheme are defined unambiguously. The question asks for a single probability, for which a unique solution can be derived from the given information.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and objective, using standard terminology from the field of genetics.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a standard, formalizable problem in theoretical genetics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three stages: determining the genotype of the $F_1$ generation, analyzing the segregation of alleles in the $F_2$ generation at a single locus, and finally compounding the probabilities across all loci.\n\nFirst, we determine the genotype of the $F_1$ hybrid generation, which results from the cross $P_1 \\times P_2$. We must consider the genotype at an arbitrary locus $L_i$.\n- Case 1: The locus $L_i$ is in the set $S$. The parental genotypes are $P_1 = A_{i}A_{i}$ and $P_2 = a_{i}a_{i}$. The cross $A_{i}A_{i} \\times a_{i}a_{i}$ exclusively produces offspring with the heterozygous genotype $A_{i}a_{i}$.\n- Case 2: The locus $L_i$ is not in a set $S$. The parental genotypes are $P_1 = a_{i}a_{i}$ and $P_2 = A_{i}A_{i}$. The cross $a_{i}a_{i} \\times A_{i}A_{i}$ also exclusively produces offspring with the heterozygous genotype $A_{i}a_{i}$.\n\nIn both cases, for any locus $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, the resulting $F_1$ offspring is heterozygous $A_{i}a_{i}$. Therefore, the genotype of any individual in the $F_1$ generation is heterozygous at all $k$ loci: $A_{1}a_{1} A_{2}a_{2} \\dots A_{k}a_{k}$. The parameters $s$ and $k-s$ are essential for defining the parental cross but are not needed for calculating the final probability, as they both lead to the same uniform $F_1$ genotype.\n\nSecond, we analyze the production of the $F_2$ generation by self-fertilizing an $F_1$ individual ($F_1 \\times F_1$). The problem states that all $k$ loci are unlinked, which implies they assort independently. This fundamental principle allows us to calculate the probability for the overall genotype by computing the product of the probabilities for each locus considered separately.\n\nLet us focus on a single locus $L_i$. The cross is $A_{i}a_{i} \\times A_{i}a_{i}$. According to the Law of Segregation, each parent produces gametes containing allele $A_{i}$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and allele $a_{i}$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The resulting genotypes in the offspring follow the classic Mendelian proportions:\n- Probability of genotype $A_{i}A_{i}$ is $P(A_{i}A_{i}) = P(\\text{gamete } A_i \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(\\text{gamete } A_i \\text{ from parent 2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- Probability of genotype $A_{i}a_{i}$ is $P(A_{i}a_{i}) = P(A_i)P(a_i) + P(a_i)P(A_i) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Probability of genotype $a_{i}a_{i}$ is $P(a_{i}a_{i}) = P(\\text{gamete } a_i \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(\\text{gamete } a_i \\text{ from parent 2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThird, we calculate the probability for the desired $F_2$ individual genotype, which is homozygous for the positive allele at all $k$ loci: $A_{1}A_{1} A_{2}A_{2} \\dots A_{k}A_{k}$. This is the \"transgressive\" genotype that exceeds the phenotypic value of both parents. The event of being homozygous $A_{i}A_{i}$ at locus $L_i$ is independent of being homozygous $A_{j}A_{j}$ at any other locus $L_j$ where $j \\neq i$. Therefore, the probability of the combined genotype is the product of the individual probabilities for each locus.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{P}$ be the desired probability.\n$$ \\mathcal{P} = P(A_{1}A_{1} \\text{ and } A_{2}A_{2} \\text{ and } \\dots \\text{ and } A_{k}A_{k}) $$\nDue to independent assortment:\n$$ \\mathcal{P} = P(A_{1}A_{1}) \\times P(A_{2}A_{2}) \\times \\dots \\times P(A_{k}A_{k}) $$\nAs established, the probability of obtaining the $A_{i}A_{i}$ genotype at any given locus $i$ from an $F_1$ self-cross is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n$$ \\mathcal{P} = \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\dots \\times \\frac{1}{4}}_{k \\text{ times}} $$\nThis product simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathcal{P} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{k} = \\frac{1}{4^{k}} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the probability that a randomly chosen $F_2$ individual is homozygous $A_{i}A_{i}$ at all $k$ loci.",

It contains sufficient information for a unique solution to be derived from first principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous derivation of the expected values and an evaluation of the options may proceed.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe genotypic value of an individual, $z$, is the sum of effects across all $L$ loci, as there is no epistasis: $z = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} z_i$, where $z_i$ is the contribution from locus $i$. The expected phenotype is equal to the expected genotypic value, as the environmental mean is $0$.\n\n**Scenario 1: Purely Additive Gene Action ($d_i = 0$), Complementary Alleles**\n\nIn this scenario, the genotypic values at locus $i$ are $aa: -a_i$, $Aa: 0$, $AA: +a_i$. The parents $P_1$ and $P_2$ are inbred lines fixed for alternative alleles. The condition of \"complementary favorable alleles\" implies that one parent does not possess all alleles that increase the trait value. Let the allele increasing the trait value be $A$ (the 'plus' allele) and the one decreasing it be $a$ (the 'minus' allele).\nLet $P_1$ have genotype $A_iA_i$ at a set of loci $S_1$ and $a_ia_i$ at loci in $S_2$, where $\\{S_1, S_2\\}$ is a partition of the $L$ loci. Then $P_2$ has genotype $a_ia_i$ at loci in $S_1$ and $A_iA_i$ at loci in $S_2$. For complementarity, both $S_1$ and $S_2$ must be non-empty.\n\n- **Parental and Midparent Values:**\nThe genotypic values of the parents are:\n$$z_{P_1} = \\sum_{i \\in S_1} (+a_i) + \\sum_{i \\in S_2} (-a_i) = \\sum_{i \\in S_1} a_i - \\sum_{i \\in S_2} a_i$$\n$$z_{P_2} = \\sum_{i \\in S_1} (-a_i) + \\sum_{i \\in S_2} (+a_i) = -\\sum_{i \\in S_1} a_i + \\sum_{i \\in S_2} a_i$$\nThe sum of the parental values is $z_{P_1} + z_{P_2} = 0$.\nThe midparent mean is $MP = (z_{P_1} + z_{P_2})/2 = 0$.\n\n- **$F_1$ Generation:**\nThe cross $P_1 \\times P_2$ yields $F_1$ offspring that are heterozygous ($A_ia_i$) at all $L$ loci.\nThe genotypic value for an $F_1$ individual is $z_{F_1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} d_i$.\nGiven $d_i = 0$ for all $i$ in this scenario, $z_{F_1} = 0$.\nSince all $F_1$ individuals are genetically identical, the expected value is $E[z_{F_1}] = 0$.\nThus, $E[z_{F_1}] = MP$. The $F_1$ mean shows no heterosis and lies exactly at the midparent value. Since $z_{P_1} = -z_{P_2}$, $z_{F_1}=0$ is between the parental values (unless both are $0$), not outside them.\n\n- **$F_2$ Generation:**\nThe $F_2$ is formed by random mating among $F_1$ individuals. At each locus $i$, Mendelian segregation produces genotypes $a_ia_i$, $A_ia_i$, and $A_iA_i$ in frequencies $1/4$, $1/2$, and $1/4$, respectively.\nThe expected value at locus $i$ is $E[z_i] = \\frac{1}{4}(-a_i) + \\frac{1}{2}(d_i) + \\frac{1}{4}(+a_i)$.\nWith $d_i = 0$, this becomes $E[z_i] = \\frac{1}{4}(-a_i) + \\frac{1}{4}(a_i) = 0$.\nThe total expected value for the $F_2$ generation is the sum of expectations across loci:\n$E[z_{F_2}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} E[z_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} 0 = 0$.\nThus, $E[z_{F_2}] = MP$. The mean of the $F_2$ generation is also at the midparent value.\n\n- **Transgressive Segregation:**\nAlthough the $F_2$ mean is $0$, segregation and recombination can produce genotypes with combinations of alleles not present in the parents. For example, an $F_2$ individual could be homozygous for the 'plus' allele ($A_iA_i$) at all $L$ loci. Its genotypic value would be $z_{max} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} a_i$. Another individual could be homozygous for the 'minus' allele ($a_ia_i$) at all loci, with value $z_{min} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{L} a_i$.\nSince the parents have complementary alleles (sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ are non-empty), $z_{P_2} = \\sum_{i \\in S_2} a_i - \\sum_{i \\in S_1} a_i < \\sum_{i=1}^L a_i = z_{max}$. Similarly, $z_{P_1} > z_{min}$.\nTherefore, the $F_2$ generation can produce individuals with phenotypes exceeding the parental range. This phenomenon is transgressive segregation. It arises from the recombination of favorable alleles that were dispersed between the two parental lines.\n\n**Scenario 2: Dominance ($d_i \\neq 0$), Directional Allele Distribution**\n\nIn this scenario, $P_2$ is the higher-mean parent, and parents are fixed for opposite alleles at each locus. This implies $P_2$ has all the 'plus' alleles and $P_1$ has all the 'minus' alleles.\n$P_1$ genotype: $a_1a_1 a_2a_2 ... a_La_L$.\n$P_2$ genotype: $A_1A_1 A_2A_2 ... A_LA_L$.\n\n- **Parental and Midparent Values:**\nThe genotypic values are:\n$$z_{P_1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} (-a_i) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{L} a_i$$\n$$z_{P_2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} (+a_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} a_i$$\nThe midparent mean is $MP = (z_{P_1} + z_{P_2})/2 = (-\\sum a_i + \\sum a_i)/2 = 0$.\n\n- **$F_1$ Generation:**\nAll $F_1$ individuals are heterozygous $A_ia_i$ at all $L$ loci.\nThe genotypic value of an $F_1$ individual is $z_{F_1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} d_i$.\nThe expected value is $E[z_{F_1}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} d_i$.\nMidparent heterosis is $E[z_{F_1}] - MP = \\sum d_i$. If there is a net directional dominance (i.e., $\\sum d_i \\neq 0$), the $F_1$ mean will deviate from the midparent value. This is heterosis due to dominance.\nThe $F_1$ can exceed the best parent ($P_2$) if $E[z_{F_1}] > z_{P_2}$, which requires $\\sum d_i > \\sum a_i$. This is known as overdominance at the whole-organism level.\n\n- **$F_2$ Generation:**\nThe expected value at locus $i$ is $E[z_i] = \\frac{1}{4}(-a_i) + \\frac{1}{2}(d_i) + \\frac{1}{4}(+a_i) = \\frac{1}{2}d_i$.\nThe total expected value for the $F_2$ is $E[z_{F_2}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} E[z_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{1}{2}d_i = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{L} d_i$.\nComparing the deviation from the midparent mean:\n$E[z_{F_1}] - MP = \\sum d_i$\n$E[z_{F_2}] - MP = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum d_i$\nThis shows that $E[z_{F_2}] - MP = \\frac{1}{2}(E[z_{F_1}] - MP)$. The heterosis observed in the $F_1$ mean is halved in the $F_2$ mean, as the frequency of heterozygotes drops from $1$ to $1/2$ at each locus.\n\n- **Transgressive Segregation:**\nIn this scenario, the best parent $P_2$ already has the optimal homozygous genotype ($A_iA_i$ at all loci) in terms of additive effects. The highest possible additive value for an $F_2$ individual is $z_{P_2} = \\sum a_i$. Therefore, transgressive segregation due to recombination of complementary additive alleles cannot occur. Exceeding the parental range in $F_2$ would only be possible if there is strong overdominance at individual loci (i.e., $d_i > a_i$), which is a different mechanism.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Declare heterosis due to dominance when $E[z_{F_1}] - MP \\neq 0$ while $E[z_{F_2}] - MP \\approx \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(E[z_{F_1}] - MP\\right)$, with only $F_1$ able to exceed the best parent in expectation (requiring sufficiently large net dominance). Declare transgressive segregation due to complementary additive alleles when $E[z_{F_1}] = MP$ and $E[z_{F_2}] = MP$, with $F_1$ not exceeding parental bounds and $F_2$ capable of producing individuals beyond both parents via segregation and recombination, even though the mean does not exceed the parents.**\n- The description of heterosis perfectly matches the derivation for Scenario 2. The relationship between $F_1$ and $F_2$ means is correct, and the condition for $F_1$ to exceed the best parent is correctly stated.\n- The description of transgressive segregation perfectly matches the derivation for Scenario 1. The mean values for $F_1$ and $F_2$ are correct, the intermediate nature of $F_1$ is correct, and the production of extreme phenotypes in $F_2$ despite an unchanged mean is the correct definition.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Declare heterosis when both $E[z_{F_1}]$ and $E[z_{F_2}]$ exceed the best parent by the same amount, and declare transgressive segregation when $E[z_{F_2}]$ exceeds the best parent while $E[z_{F_1}] = MP$.**\n- The first part is incorrect. $E[z_{F_2}]$ shows half the heterosis of $E[z_{F_1}]$, they are not the same.\n- The second part is incorrect. In the model for transgressive segregation, $E[z_{F_2}] = MP$, which does not exceed the best parent. It is the individuals, not the mean, that transgress.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Declare heterosis when $E[z_{F_1}] = MP$ but the $F_1$ distribution has tails beyond both parents because heterozygosity increases variance, and declare transgressive segregation when $E[z_{F_2}]$ regresses to $MP$ from a high $F_1$.**\n- The first part is incorrect. Heterosis due to dominance results in $E[z_{F_1}] \\neq MP$. Furthermore, the $F_1$ generation is genetically uniform, having zero genetic variance.\n- The second part is incorrect. The regression of the mean from $F_1$ to $F_2$ is characteristic of dominance heterosis, not transgressive segregation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Declare heterosis under dominance when $E[z_{F_2}] > E[z_{F_1}]$ and both exceed the best parent, and declare transgressive segregation under additivity when $E[z_{F_1}]$ already exceeds the best parent because heterozygotes combine favorable alleles from both lines.**\n- The first part is incorrect. The mean regresses from $F_1$ to $F_2$, so $E[z_{F_1}] > E[z_{F_2}]$ (assuming positive dominance effects).\n- The second part is incorrect. Under additivity, $E[z_{F_1}] = MP$, which is not greater than the best parent.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation from first principles, Option A is the only statement that correctly describes the genetic basis and expected generational patterns for both heterosis and transgressive segregation under the specified models.",
