This exercise models this process at its most fundamental level, connecting the proportion of new migrants, $m$, to the reduction in the average inbreeding coefficient, $F$, in the very next generation. By deriving this relationship from first principles, you will gain a core quantitative intuition for how much immigration is needed to achieve a target reduction in inbreeding, a foundational skill for planning any rescue program .",

            "problem": "A small, isolated vertebrate population has an inbreeding coefficient $F_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.25$ measured relative to a base population with negligible identity by descent. A conservation manager considers a single-generation genetic rescue by mixing this population with an introduced donor group. Let $m$ be the fraction of breeding adults that are immigrants drawn from a large, unrelated donor population. Assume the following:\n- Donors are unrelated among themselves and to all residents, so their inbreeding coefficient is $F_{\\mathrm{M}} = 0$, and the kinship between any donor and any resident is $0$.\n- After the immigrant pulse, mating is random among all adults, with equal contributions to the gamete pool from immigrants and residents proportional to their frequencies.\n- The inbreeding coefficient $F$ is defined as the probability that the two alleles at a locus in a randomly chosen individual are identical by descent (IBD).\n- Consider only the first offspring generation immediately following the pulse (ignore pedigree relationships beyond parental origin in that generation).\n\nStarting from the definition of $F$ as an IBD probability and basic probability rules for mixtures of independent sources, derive the expression for the expected offspring inbreeding coefficient $F'$ after the pulse as a function of $F_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and $m$, and then determine the smallest value of $m$ such that $F'$ is reduced from $0.25$ to $0.10$ in one generation.\n\nProvide the final value of $m$ as a decimal fraction (not a percentage).

Provide the final value of $m$ rounded to four significant figures.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, being a standard application of fundamental principles of population genetics, specifically admixture and inbreeding theory. The concepts of inbreeding coefficient ($F$), identity by descent (IBD), and genetic rescue through admixture are central to conservation genetics. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and conditions defined, leading to a unique and meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. The assumptions (e.g., random mating, properties of the donor population) are explicit and standard for such models. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a valid, solvable problem in evolutionary biology.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe inbreeding coefficient of an individual in the next generation, which we denote as $F'$, is the probability that the two alleles at a given locus in that individual are identical by descent (IBD). An individual receives one allele from its sire and one from its dam. Therefore, $F'$ is equivalent to the kinship coefficient between its parents. With random mating in the admixed population, the expected inbreeding coefficient of the offspring generation, $F'$, is the weighted average of the kinship coefficients for all possible types of parental pairs.\n\nThe admixed population consists of two groups: original residents (R) and new immigrants (M, for migrants). The proportion of residents is $(1-m)$ and the proportion of immigrants is $m$. Under random mating, a parent is drawn from the resident group with probability $(1-m)$ and from the immigrant group with probability $m$. Since the sire and dam are chosen independently, we have four possible mating types with the following probabilities:\n1. Both parents are residents (R $\\times$ R): $P(\\text{R} \\times \\text{R}) = (1-m) \\times (1-m) = (1-m)^2$\n2. Sire is resident, dam is immigrant (R $\\times$ M): $P(\\text{R} \\times \\text{M}) = (1-m) \\times m$\n3. Sire is immigrant, dam is resident (M $\\times$ R): $P(\\text{M} \\times \\text{R}) = m \\times (1-m)$\n4. Both parents are immigrants (M $\\times$ M): $P(\\text{M} \\times \\text{M}) = m \\times m = m^2$\n\nThe expected inbreeding coefficient of an offspring, $F'$, is the average kinship coefficient of the parental pairs, weighted by the frequency of each pairing type. Let $\\phi_{XY}$ be the average kinship between a randomly chosen individual from group X and a randomly chosen individual from group Y. The problem statement gives us the necessary kinship values:\n- The average kinship between two randomly chosen residents, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{RR}}$, is equal to the inbreeding coefficient of the resident population, $F_{\\mathrm{R}}$. Thus, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{RR}} = F_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.25$.\n- The kinship between any donor and any resident is given as $0$. Thus, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{RM}} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{MR}} = 0$.\n- The donors are unrelated among themselves. Thus, the average kinship between two randomly chosen immigrants is $\\phi_{\\mathrm{MM}} = 0$.\n\nThe expected offspring inbreeding coefficient $F'$ is calculated as follows:\n$$F' = P(\\text{R} \\times \\text{R}) \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathrm{RR}} + P(\\text{R} \\times \\text{M}) \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathrm{RM}} + P(\\text{M} \\times \\text{R}) \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathrm{MR}} + P(\\text{M} \\times \\text{M}) \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathrm{MM}}$$\nSubstituting the probabilities and kinship values:\n$$F' = (1-m)^2 \\cdot F_{\\mathrm{R}} + (1-m)m \\cdot 0 + m(1-m) \\cdot 0 + m^2 \\cdot 0$$\nThis simplifies to the required expression for $F'$ as a function of $F_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and $m$:\n$$F' = F_{\\mathrm{R}}(1-m)^2$$\nThis result is logical, as IBD in the offspring can only arise if both alleles are inherited from the original, inbred resident gene pool. The probability of drawing two gametes that both originate from residents is $(1-m)^2$, and the conditional probability that these two gametes are IBD is $F_{\\mathrm{R}}$.\n\nNow, we must solve for the value of $m$ that reduces the inbreeding coefficient from $F_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.25$ to $F' = 0.10$. We substitute these values into the derived equation:\n$$0.10 = 0.25(1-m)^2$$\nFirst, we isolate the term $(1-m)^2$:\n$$(1-m)^2 = \\frac{0.10}{0.25} = \\frac{10}{25} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$$\nNext, we take the square root of both sides. Since $m$ is a fraction of the population, $0 \\le m \\le 1$, which implies that $(1-m) \\ge 0$. Therefore, we only need to consider the positive root:\n$$1-m = \\sqrt{0.4}$$\nSolving for $m$:\n$$m = 1 - \\sqrt{0.4}$$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we compute the square root of $0.4$:\n$$\\sqrt{0.4} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{10}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{10}}{10} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{5} \\approx 0.6324555...$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $m$:\n$$m \\approx 1 - 0.6324555... = 0.3675444...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $4$, so we round down.\n$$m \\approx 0.3675$$\nThis is the smallest fraction of immigrants required to achieve the target reduction in inbreeding in a single generation under the specified conditions.",

            "introduction": "While first-generation hybrids from a genetic rescue often exhibit high fitness (heterosis), this benefit can be deceptive and short-lived. The genetic shuffling that occurs via recombination in subsequent generations can lead to a decline in population fitness, a phenomenon known as outbreeding depression or hybrid breakdown. This practice explores this critical risk using a two-locus model where recombination can assemble novel, unfit combinations of alleles that were masked in the F1 generation . Calculating the expected fitness change from the F1 to the F2 generation will illuminate how genetic interactions (epistasis) and linkage ($r$) create a significant challenge that must be anticipated in conservation planning.",

            "problem": "A small island population is the target of a genetic rescue. Two inbred source populations, denoted by population $\\mathcal{P}_1$ and population $\\mathcal{P}_2$, are fixed for different recessive deleterious alleles at two nuclear loci, $A$ and $B$, that are on the same autosome. Specifically, population $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is fixed for genotype $aaBB$ and population $\\mathcal{P}_2$ is fixed for genotype $AAbb$. A single round of rescue introduces migrants from both sources and produces first-generation hybrids (F1) that are all double heterozygotes $AaBb$. These F1 individuals then randomly mate among themselves to form the second generation (F2). Assume standard Mendelian segregation, no segregation distortion, and no viability selection prior to zygote formation. Let the recombination fraction between loci $A$ and $B$ in F1 meioses be $r$, with $0 \\le r \\le \\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n\nDefine per-locus fitness contributions as follows. For locus $A$, the fitnesses are $w_{AA} = 1$, $w_{Aa} = 1 - h_{A} s_{A}$, and $w_{aa} = 1 - s_{A}$. For locus $B$, the fitnesses are $w_{BB} = 1$, $w_{Bb} = 1 - h_{B} s_{B}$, and $w_{bb} = 1 - s_{B}$. Across loci, assume multiplicative fitness with an additional synergistic epistasis penalty $e$ applied only to the double-homozygous deleterious genotype $aabb$, so that the two-locus fitness is\n$$\nW = \\big(w_{A\\cdot}\\big)\\big(w_{B\\cdot}\\big)\\times\n\\begin{cases}\n1 - e,  \\text{if the genotype is } aabb,\\\\\n1,  \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nTake biologically plausible parameter values $s_{A} = 0.6$, $h_{A} = 0.1$, $s_{B} = 0.5$, $h_{B} = 0.2$, and $e = 0.4$. Under these values, F1 heterosis arises because $AaBb$ masks distinct recessive loads, whereas F2 recombination can reveal double homozygotes that express synergistic epistasis.\n\nUsing only Mendelian segregation and the definition of recombination in a two-locus F1 double heterozygote, derive the expected mean fitness in F2 as a function of the recombination fraction $r$ by averaging over all F2 two-locus genotypes formed by random union of F1 gametes. Then subtract the F1 mean fitness to obtain the expected mean fitness change $\\Delta(r) = \\mathbb{E}[W_{\\mathrm{F2}}](r) - W_{\\mathrm{F1}}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is deemed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard, albeit specific, problem in two-locus population genetics theory. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided for a unique solution. We shall therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the expression for the change in mean fitness from the F1 to the F2 generation, $\\Delta(r) = \\mathbb{E}[W_{\\mathrm{F2}}](r) - W_{\\mathrm{F1}}$, as a function of the recombination fraction $r$.\n\nFirst, we determine the mean fitness of the F1 generation, $W_{\\mathrm{F1}}$. The problem states that the F1 generation consists entirely of individuals with the genotype $AaBb$. Therefore, the mean fitness of this generation is the fitness of this specific genotype. According to the multiplicative fitness model provided,\n$$W_{\\mathrm{F1}} = W_{AaBb} = w_{Aa} \\cdot w_{Bb} = (1 - h_{A} s_{A})(1 - h_{B} s_{B})$$\nThe synergistic epistasis term does not apply as the genotype is not $aabb$. We substitute the given parameter values: $s_{A} = 0.6$, $h_{A} = 0.1$, $s_{B} = 0.5$, and $h_{B} = 0.2$.\n$$h_{A} s_{A} = 0.1 \\times 0.6 = 0.06$$\n$$h_{B} s_{B} = 0.2 \\times 0.5 = 0.1$$\nThus, the F1 fitness is:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{F1}} = (1 - 0.06)(1 - 0.1) = 0.94 \\times 0.9 = 0.846$$\n\nNext, we derive the expected mean fitness of the F2 generation, $\\mathbb{E}[W_{\\mathrm{F2}}](r)$. The F2 generation is formed by random mating among the F1 individuals. The F1 individuals are of genotype $AaBb$, formed from a cross between source populations fixed for $AAbb$ and $aaBB$. This implies the F1 individuals are double heterozygotes in repulsion (or trans) phase, with genotype configuration $\\frac{Ab}{aB}$.\n\nDuring meiosis in these F1 individuals, gametes are produced with frequencies dependent on the recombination fraction $r$.\n- The parental (non-recombinant) gametes are $Ab$ and $aB$. They are produced with a total frequency of $1-r$. Each has a frequency of $\\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n- The recombinant gametes are $AB$ and $ab$. They are produced with a total frequency of $r$. Each has a frequency of $\\frac{r}{2}$.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are formed by the random union of these four gamete types. The mean fitness is the average of the fitness of all possible F2 genotypes, weighted by their frequencies. A direct summation over the nine genotypes is laborious. A more structured approach consists of classifying the F2 zygotes based on the gametes from which they are formed.\n1.  **Parental $\\times$ Parental (PP):** A zygote formed by the union of two parental gametes ($Ab$ or $aB$). The total frequency of this event is $(1-r)^2$.\n2.  **Recombinant $\\times$ Recombinant (RR):** A zygote formed by the union of two recombinant gametes ($AB$ or $ab$). The total frequency of this event is $r^2$.\n3.  **Parental $\\times$ Recombinant (PR):** A zygote formed by the union of one parental and one recombinant gamete. The total frequency of this event is $2r(1-r)$.\n\nThe mean fitness can be expressed as:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[W_{\\mathrm{F2}}](r) = (1-r)^2 \\bar{W}_{\\mathrm{PP}} + r^2 \\bar{W}_{\\mathrm{RR}} + 2r(1-r) \\bar{W}_{\\mathrm{PR}}$$\nwhere $\\bar{W}_{\\mathrm{PP}}$, $\\bar{W}_{\\mathrm{RR}}$, and $\\bar{W}_{\\mathrm{PR}}$ are the constant mean fitnesses within each class of zygotes.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the fitness values for all nine possible genotypes using the provided parameters: $s_A = 0.6, h_A=0.1, s_B=0.5, h_B=0.2, e=0.4$.\n- Per-locus fitness components:\n$w_{AA} = 1$, $w_{Aa} = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94$, $w_{aa} = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$.\n$w_{BB} = 1$, $w_{Bb} = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$, $w_{bb} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n- Two-locus fitness values ($W$):\n$W_{AABB} = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n$W_{AABb} = 1 \\times 0.9 = 0.9$.\n$W_{AAbb} = 1 \\times 0.5 = 0.5$.\n$W_{AaBB} = 0.94 \\times 1 = 0.94$.\n$W_{AaBb} = 0.94 \\times 0.9 = 0.846$.\n$W_{Aabb} = 0.94 \\times 0.5 = 0.47$.\n$W_{aaBB} = 0.4 \\times 1 = 0.4$.\n$W_{aaBb} = 0.4 \\times 0.9 = 0.36$.\n$W_{aabb} = (0.4 \\times 0.5) \\times (1 - 0.4) = 0.2 \\times 0.6 = 0.12$.\n\nNow we calculate the mean fitness for each zygote class:\n- $\\bar{W}_{\\mathrm{PP}}$: Zygotes from parental gametes ($Ab, aB$) are $AAbb$ (from $Ab \\times Ab$), $aaBB$ (from $aB \\times aB$), and $AaBb$ (from $Ab \\times aB$ and $aB \\times Ab$).

The solution is derived in three parts: first, the construction of the objective utility function $U(x)$; second, the formalization of the feasible set for $x$ from the given constraints; and third, the solution of the resulting constrained optimization problem.\n\nLet the non-negative maladaptation weight be denoted by $c_{m} \\geq 0$ and the non-negative logistical cost weight by $c_{L} \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Objective Function $U(x)$**\n\nThe objective function $U(x)$ is constructed on the log-fitness utility scale. It aggregates the fitness gain from inbreeding relief with the penalties from maladaptation and logistical costs. The baseline for comparison is the state of the population with no intervention, i.e., at $x=0$.\n\nThe fitness of the population as a function of the inbreeding coefficient $F$ is given by the Morton-type model, $W = W_{0} \\exp(-B F)$. The log-fitness is therefore $\\ln(W) = \\ln(W_{0}) - B F$.\n\nWithout rescue ($x=0$), the inbreeding coefficient is $F$, and the log-fitness is $\\ln(W(0)) = \\ln(W_{0}) - B F$.\n\nWith a migrant ancestry proportion $x$, the inbreeding coefficient in the first hybrid generation is reduced to $F' = (1 - x)^{2} F$.

This is represented as $-c_{m} D x^{2}$.\n-   A logistical and economic cost penalty, which is linear in $x$. This is represented as $-c_{L} x$.\n\nThe total objective function $U(x)$ is the sum of the gain and the penalties:\n$$\nU(x) = B F (2x - x^{2}) - c_{m} D x^{2} - c_{L} x\n$$\nGrouping terms by powers of $x$, we obtain the quadratic objective function:\n$$\nU(x) = (2BF - c_{L})x - (BF + c_{m} D)x^{2}\n$$\n\n**2. Formalization of the Constraint Set**\n\nThe choice of $x$ is subject to three specified constraints, which define the feasible set.\n-   The trivial physical bound is $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n-   The genomic replacement policy constraint is $x \\leq \\rho$, where $\\rho \\in (0, 1]$.\n-   The catastrophic outbreeding risk constraint is $P_{\\mathrm{cat}}(x) \\leq \\alpha$, where $P_{\\mathrm{cat}}(x) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda D x^{2})$ and $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$.

Dividing by $-\\lambda D$ reverses the inequality:\n    $$\n    x^{2} \\leq -\\frac{\\ln(1 - \\alpha)}{\\lambda D}\n    $$\n    Since $x$ must be non-negative, we have:\n    $$\n    x \\leq \\sqrt{-\\frac{\\ln(1 - \\alpha)}{\\lambda D}}\n    $$\n    If $D=0$, the risk probability is $P_{cat}(x)=0$ for all $x$, and the constraint $0 \\leq \\alpha$ is trivially satisfied, thus imposing no upper bound on $x$. Our expression requires $D0$; the assumption $D0$ is scientifically reasonable as $D=0$ implies donor and recipient populations are identical, making the concepts of \"rescue\" and \"outbreeding\" meaningless.\n\nCombining all constraints, $x$ must lie in the interval $[0, x_{\\text{max}}]$, where $x_{\\text{max}}$ is the most restrictive upper bound:\n$$\nx_{\\text{max}} = \\min\\left(1, \\rho, \\sqrt{-\\frac{\\ln(1 - \\alpha)}{\\lambda D}}\\right)\n$$\nThe optimization problem is to maximize $U(x)$ for $x \\in [0, x_{\\text{max}}]$.\n\n**3. Constrained Optimization**\n\nThe objective function is $U(x) = (2BF - c_{L})x - (BF + c_{m} D)x^{2}$. To determine its shape, we compute the second derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}U}{dx^{2}} = -2(BF + c_{m} D)\n$$\nSince $B$, $F$, $c_{m}$, and $D$ are all non-negative, the term $(BF + c_{m} D) \\geq 0$. Assuming the non-trivial case where not all these parameters are zero, the second derivative is strictly negative. This confirms that $U(x)$ is a strictly concave function, which means it has a unique global maximum.\n\nTo find the unconstrained maximum, we set the first derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dx} = 2BF - c_{L} - 2(BF + c_{m} D)x = 0\n$$\nSolving for $x$ gives the unconstrained optimal value, which we denote as $x_{\\text{unc}}$:\n$$\nx_{\\text{unc}} = \\frac{2BF - c_{L}}{2(BF + c_{m} D)}\n$$\n\nThe solution to the constrained problem, $x^{\\ast}$, is the projection of the unconstrained optimum $x_{\\text{unc}}$ onto the feasible interval $[0, x_{\\text{max}}]$. The logic is elementary:\n-   If $x_{\\text{unc}}  0$, the function $U(x)$ is decreasing for all $x \\geq 0$. The maximum over $[0, x_{\\text{max}}]$ is at $x^{\\ast} = 0$.\n-   If $x_{\\text{unc}}  x_{\\text{max}}$, the function is increasing over the entire feasible interval $[0, x_{\\text{max}}]$. The maximum is at the upper boundary, $x^{\\ast} = x_{\\text{max}}$.\n-   If $0 \\leq x_{\\text{unc}} \\leq x_{\\text{max}}$, the unconstrained maximum lies within the feasible interval, so it is also the constrained maximum, $x^{\\ast} = x_{\\text{unc}}$.\n\nThese three cases can be written compactly using the max and min functions. First, the value must be non-negative, so we take $\\max(0, x_{\\text{unc}})$. Then, this value is capped by the upper bound $x_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\min\\left( \\max(0, x_{\\text{unc}}), x_{\\text{max}} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $x_{\\text{unc}}$ and $x_{\\text{max}}$, we obtain the final closed-form solution for the optimal ancestry proportion $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\min\\left( \\max\\left(0, \\frac{2BF - c_{L}}{2(BF + c_{m} D)}\\right), 1, \\rho, \\sqrt{-\\frac{\\ln(1 - \\alpha)}{\\lambda D}} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression provides the single analytic solution for the optimal level of gene flow as a function of all specified biological, economic, and policy parameters.",
