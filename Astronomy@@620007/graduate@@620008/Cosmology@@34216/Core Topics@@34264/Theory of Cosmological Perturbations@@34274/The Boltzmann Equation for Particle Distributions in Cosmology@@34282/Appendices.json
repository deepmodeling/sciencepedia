This exercise ([@problem_id:856522]) illustrates this by quantifying how a hypothetical non-thermal feature in the electron neutrino spectrum, which modifies the Boltzmann equilibrium for neutron-proton conversion, would leave a measurable fingerprint on the primordial Helium-4 mass fraction $Y_P$.", "problem": "During Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the primordial abundance of Helium-4, quantified by the mass fraction $Y_P$, is primarily determined by the neutron-to-proton ratio, $(n/p)$, at the time of nucleosynthesis. This ratio is established when the weak interaction rates that interconvert neutrons and protons ($n \\leftrightarrow p$) fall below the Hubble expansion rate, a moment known as \"weak freeze-out\".\n\nThe standard BBN model assumes that all particles, including neutrinos, follow thermal equilibrium distributions. The evolution of particle distributions is governed by the Boltzmann equation. Here, we consider a scenario where a non-thermal process, perhaps due to the decay of a heavy particle, injects a population of electron neutrinos ($\\nu_e$) into the primordial plasma. This modifies the $\\nu_e$ distribution function, which in turn alters the neutron-proton conversion rates.\n\nLet's model the effect of this non-thermal neutrino component with the following assumptions:\n1.  The equilibrium neutron-to-proton ratio, which in the standard model is $(n/p)_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{th}} = \\exp(-Q/T)$ where $Q$ is the neutron-proton mass difference and $T$ is the temperature, is modified to:\n    $$\n    (n/p)_{\\text{eq}}' = (n/p)_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{th}} (1 - \\xi) = (1 - \\xi) \\exp(-Q/T)\n    $$\n    Here, $\\xi$ is a small, positive, dimensionless constant that parameterizes the strength of the non-thermal effect.\n\n2.  The specific modification to the rates is such that the total interaction rate, $\\Lambda = \\lambda_{n \\to p} + \\lambda_{p \\to n}$, remains unchanged at any given temperature. Consequently, the freeze-out temperature, $T_f$, is identical to its value in the standard BBN scenario.\n\n3.  The neutron-to-proton ratio freezes out at the value $(n/p)_f = (n/p)_{\\text{eq}}'(T_f)$. After freeze-out, this ratio evolves only due to free neutron decay until the onset of nucleosynthesis at a later time $t_N$.
