While adiabatic modes grow unimpeded, the evolution of isocurvature modes is profoundly affected by the interplay between gravity and pressure in the early universe. This exercise develops the physical intuition behind this difference by asking you to derive the characteristic damping wavenumber, $k_D$, for CDM isocurvature perturbations. By considering the sound horizon of the photon fluid at matter-radiation equality, you will understand why isocurvature perturbations are naturally suppressed on small scales, a fundamental feature that shapes their observational signatures [@problem_id:807722].", "problem": "In a simplified cosmological model, the universe is flat and contains only Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and a tightly-coupled photon fluid. The initial primordial perturbations are purely of the CDM isocurvature type. This implies that on super-horizon scales, the total energy density is spatially uniform, but there is a non-zero perturbation in the ratio of CDM to photon number densities. Consequently, the initial metric perturbations are zero.\n\nAs the universe expands, a perturbation mode with comoving wavenumber $k$ eventually enters the Hubble horizon and begins to evolve dynamically. The photon fluid, having significant pressure, resists gravitational collapse on small scales. This resistance is gravitationally communicated to the pressureless CDM, resulting in an effective suppression or \"damping\" of the initial CDM density perturbations on smaller scales. This process imprints a characteristic comoving damping wavenumber, $k_D$, on the CDM power spectrum. Modes with $k \\gg k_D$ experience significant suppression relative to modes with $k \\ll k_D$.\n\nThis fundamental scale $k_D$ is determined by the physical properties of the cosmos at the time of matter-radiation equality, denoted by the conformal time $\\tau_{eq}$.
