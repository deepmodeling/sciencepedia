This exercise explores the physical origin of its characteristic shape, which shows a suppression of power on small scales. By modeling the evolution of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) perturbations, you will see how modes that enter the horizon during the radiation-dominated era experience stalled growth, a phenomenon known as the Mészáros effect, and apply the fundamental technique of matching super-horizon and sub-horizon solutions to derive this signature suppression [@problem_id:875792].", "problem": "The matter transfer function, $T(k)$, is a fundamental quantity in cosmology that describes the evolution of density perturbations from the early universe to the present. It quantifies the suppression of growth for perturbations that enter the horizon during the radiation-dominated era compared to those that enter during the matter-dominated era.\n\nThe evolution of cold dark matter (CDM) density perturbations $\\delta_m$ for sub-horizon modes in a universe containing matter and radiation is governed by the Mészáros equation. Using the variable $y = a/a_{eq}$, where $a$ is the scale factor and $a_{eq}$ is the scale factor at matter-radiation equality, the equation for the growth factor $D(y) \\equiv \\delta_m(y)$ is:\n$$ D''(y) + \\frac{3y+2}{2y(y+1)} D'(y) - \\frac{3}{2y(y+1)} D(y) = 0 $$\nHere, primes denote derivatives with respect to $y$. This equation has two linearly independent solutions: a growing mode $D_1(y)$ and a decaying mode $D_2(y)$. Their asymptotic behaviors are:\n- For $y \\to \\infty$ (matter domination): $D_1(y) \\propto y$ and $D_2(y) \\propto y^{-3/2}$.\n- For $y \\to 0$ (radiation domination): $D_1(y)$ approaches a constant, while $D_2(y)$ has a logarithmic dependence on $y$. Specifically, you may use the approximations $D_1(y) \\approx 1$, $D_1'(y) \\approx \\text{const}$, and $D_2(y) \\approx \\mathcal{A} \\ln(y/\\mathcal{B})$, $D_2'(y) \\approx \\mathcal{A}/y$ for some constants $\\mathcal{A, B}$.
