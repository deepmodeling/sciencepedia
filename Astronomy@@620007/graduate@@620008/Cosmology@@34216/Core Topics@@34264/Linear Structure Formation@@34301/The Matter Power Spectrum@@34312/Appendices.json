This problem explores the relationship between the statistical properties of these two fields in the linear regime.\n\n**Background:**\n\n1.  **Continuity Equation:** In an expanding Universe described by the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, the evolution of small perturbations is governed by linearized fluid equations. In comoving coordinates, the linearized continuity equation relates the matter density contrast, $\\delta(\\mathbf{x}, t) = (\\rho(\\mathbf{x}, t) - \\bar{\\rho}(t))/\\bar{\\rho}(t)$, to the peculiar velocity field, $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$, via:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\delta}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{a(t)} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0 $$\n    where $a(t)$ is the cosmological scale factor, and $t$ is cosmic time.\n\n2.  **Linear Growth of Structure:** In the linear regime ($\\delta \\ll 1$), the density contrast at a fixed comoving position $\\mathbf{x}$ grows self-similarly with time. This growth can be described by a time-dependent linear growth factor, $D(a)$, such that $\\delta(\\mathbf{x}, a) = D(a) \\delta_{\\text{in}}(\\mathbf{x})$, where $\\delta_{\\text{in}}(\\mathbf{x})$ is the initial density field. The rate of this growth is often parameterized by the dimensionless linear growth rate, $f(a)$, defined as:\n    $$ f(a) \\equiv \\frac{d \\ln D(a)}{d \\ln a} $$\n\n3.  **Power Spectra:** For statistically homogeneous and isotropic random fields, such as the cosmological density and velocity fields, all statistical information is contained in their two-point statistics. In Fourier space, this is captured by the power spectrum. For a generic field $F(\\mathbf{x})$, its power spectrum $P_F(k)$ is defined by the variance of its Fourier modes $\\tilde{F}(\\mathbf{k})$:\n    $$ \\langle \\tilde{F}(\\mathbf{k}) \\tilde{F}^*(\\mathbf{k}') \\rangle = (2\\pi)^3 \\delta_D(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k}') P_F(k) $$\n    where $k=|\\mathbf{k}|$, $\\delta_D$ is the Dirac delta function, and angle brackets denote an ensemble average.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nConsider the peculiar velocity divergence field, defined as $\\theta(\\mathbf{x}, a) = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, a)$.
