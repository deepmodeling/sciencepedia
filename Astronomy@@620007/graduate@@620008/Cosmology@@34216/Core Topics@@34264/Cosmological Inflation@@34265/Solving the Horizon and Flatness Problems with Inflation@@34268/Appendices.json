Inflation drives the curvature density parameter, $\\Omega_k$, extremely close to zero. However, in the subsequent reheating phase, this parameter can be amplified. Consider a model where, after inflation ends at a scale factor $a_{end}$ and Hubble parameter $H_{end}$, the universe enters a reheating phase dominated by the coherent oscillations of the inflaton scalar field.
