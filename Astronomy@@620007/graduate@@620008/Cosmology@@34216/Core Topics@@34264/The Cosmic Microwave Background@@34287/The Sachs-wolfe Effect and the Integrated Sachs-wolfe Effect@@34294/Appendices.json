As it travels towards us, it can pass through large-scale structures like superclusters of galaxies. We can model such a supercluster as a region of space with a characteristic size $L$ and an associated gravitational potential $\\Phi$, which is negative (a potential well).\n\nIn a static universe, a photon gains energy (gravitational blueshift) upon entering the potential well and loses the exact same amount of energy (gravitational redshift) upon exiting, resulting in no net energy change. However, in an expanding universe with dark energy, these large-scale potentials are not static; they decay over time.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this phenomenon, known as the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. A CMB photon travels at the speed of light, $c$. Upon entering a region of gravitational potential $\\Phi$, the photon's fractional energy change $\\Delta E / E$ is given by $-\\Phi / c^2$. The universe is undergoing accelerated expansion, driven by dark energy. This acceleration suppresses the growth of a supercluster, causing its gravitational potential to decay.
