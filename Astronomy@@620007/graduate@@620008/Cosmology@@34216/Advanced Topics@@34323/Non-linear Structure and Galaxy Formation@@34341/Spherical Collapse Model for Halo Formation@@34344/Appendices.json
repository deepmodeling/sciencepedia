Initially, the entire overdensity collapses and virializes to form a spherical halo of radius $R_0$. You may assume this initial halo has a uniform density and that the CDM and dDM components are well-mixed within it.\n2.  Following this, the dDM component cools efficiently via a hypothetical \"dark Bremsstrahlung\" process. This allows it to lose energy and collapse towards the center of the halo.

For its effect on the CDM halo, you can approximate this disk as a point mass $M_d = f_d M$ located at the halo's center.\n\nThe contraction of the dDM component happens slowly compared to the orbital periods of the CDM particles. Consequently, the CDM component of the halo responds by contracting adiabatically to the deepening gravitational potential.
