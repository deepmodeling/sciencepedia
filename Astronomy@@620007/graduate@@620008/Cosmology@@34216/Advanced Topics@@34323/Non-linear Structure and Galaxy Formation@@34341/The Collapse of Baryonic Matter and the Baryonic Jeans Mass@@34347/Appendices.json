Small density fluctuations present in this medium served as the seeds for all cosmic structures we see today. For a spherical overdensity to collapse under its own gravity, its mass must exceed a critical threshold known as the Jeans mass, $M_J$. Any perturbation with a mass less than this will be stabilized by its own internal pressure. This problem asks you to estimate the characteristic mass of the first gravitationally bound objects (the progenitors of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies) by calculating the Jeans mass for baryonic matter at the time of recombination.\n\nThe Jeans mass for a self-gravitating gas is given by:\n$$M_J = \\frac{\\pi^{5/2}}{6} \\frac{c_s^3}{G^{3/2} \\rho_b^{1/2}}$$\nwhere $c_s$ is the speed of sound in the gas, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $\\rho_b$ is the density of the baryonic gas.\n\nThe speed of sound in the baryonic gas (mostly neutral hydrogen) can be approximated by the isothermal sound speed:\n$$c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_b}{m_p}}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_b$ is the temperature of the baryons, and $m_p$ is the mass of a proton.\n\nAssume that recombination occurs at a redshift of $z_{rec} = 1100$. Before and during this epoch, the baryonic gas temperature was tightly coupled to the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The temperature of the gas at recombination can thus be related to the present-day CMB temperature, $T_{CMB,0}$, by $T_b = T_{CMB,0}(1+z_{rec})$. Similarly, the baryonic density at recombination, $\\rho_b(z_{rec})$, is related to its present-day value by $\\rho_b(z_{rec}) = \\rho_{b,0}(1+z_{rec})^3$.

This analysis demonstrates how cosmologists refine theoretical models to capture the complex dynamics of the early universe.", "problem": "In the standard cosmological model, primordial density perturbations are adiabatic, meaning all species (baryons, dark matter, photons) have the same initial fractional overdensity. However, alternative models allow for isocurvature perturbations. One such model includes compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIPs), where an initial overdensity in baryons is balanced by an underdensity in dark matter, such that the total matter density perturbation is initially zero.\n\nA key consequence of such CIPs is the generation of a significant relative streaming velocity, $v_{bc}$, between baryons and cold dark matter after cosmological recombination. This streaming velocity is found to be nearly constant with redshift $z$ for $z < z_{rec}$, where $z_{rec}$ is the redshift of recombination. This motion of baryons through the dark matter distribution affects the conditions for gravitational collapse.
