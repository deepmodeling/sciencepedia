A simplified but powerful model treats these structures as uniform spherical \"overdensities\" that have detached from the overall cosmic expansion and collapsed to form a gravitationally bound system.\n\nConsider a massive galaxy cluster that has recently formed at low redshift. We can model this cluster as a uniform sphere of total mass $M$. According to the spherical collapse model, such an object virializes (i.e., reaches a stable equilibrium) when its average density becomes approximately $\\Delta_c$ times the critical density of the universe at that time. For a low-redshift cluster, we can use the present-day critical density, $\\rho_{c,0}$. The critical density is given by the expression $\\rho_{c,0} = \\frac{3H_0^2}{8\\pi G}$. The radius of the cluster determined by this condition is known as the virial radius, $R_{vir}$.\n\nYour task is to estimate the depth of the gravitational potential well at the edge of this cluster. Specifically, calculate the magnitude of the gravitational potential at the virial radius, $|\\Phi(R_{vir})|$, and normalize it by the square of the speed of light, $c^2$.\n\nUse the following values for your calculation:\n- Total mass of the cluster, $M = 1.00 \\times 10^{15}$ solar masses\n- Solar mass, $M_{\\odot} = 1.989 \\times 10^{30}$ kg\n- Gravitational constant, $G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}^3 \\text{ kg}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-2}$\n- Hubble constant, $H_0 = 2.27 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{ s}^{-1}$ (equivalent to approx. 70 km/s/Mpc)\n- Overdensity factor, $\\Delta_c = 200$\n- Speed of light, $c = 2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nProvide a numerical answer for the dimensionless quantity $|\\Phi(R_{vir})|/c^2$.
