This makes them powerful probes for cosmology. For sources at low redshift ($z \\ll 1$), the luminosity distance can be approximated by the second-order Taylor expansion in redshift:\n$$d_L(z) = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\left( z + \\frac{1}{2}(1-q_0)z^2 + \\mathcal{O}(z^3) \\right)$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light, $H_0$ is the Hubble constant, and $q_0$ is the present-day deceleration parameter.\n\nConsider a future gravitational wave survey that will observe a large number of standard sirens. We make the following simplifying assumptions about this survey:\n1.  The fractional error on each luminosity distance measurement is a constant, $\\epsilon$. The standard deviation of the measurement at redshift $z$ is thus $\\sigma_{d_L}(z) = \\epsilon d_L(z)$. For the purpose of evaluating this error magnitude, it is sufficient to use the leading-order term of the expansion, i.e., $\\sigma_{d_L}(z) \\approx \\epsilon \\frac{cz}{H_0}$.\n2.

The GW signal provides a direct measurement of the luminosity distance, $d_L$, but this measurement is degenerate with the binary's inclination angle, $\\iota$, which is the angle between the binary's orbital angular momentum vector, $\\vec{L}$, and the line of sight.\n\nFor a population of sirens with known redshifts, this degeneracy can be broken if an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart, like a short Gamma-Ray Burst (sGRB), is observed.
