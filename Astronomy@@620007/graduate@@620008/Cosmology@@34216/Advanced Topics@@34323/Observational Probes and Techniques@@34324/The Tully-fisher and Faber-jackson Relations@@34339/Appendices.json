The stellar motions in its central region are described by a velocity dispersion tensor that is diagonal in a Cartesian coordinate system $(x, y, z)$ aligned with the galaxy's principal axes.

It is often expressed as a power law, $L \\propto v_{\\text{max}}^{\\alpha}$. This relation is typically visualized in a log-log plot of luminosity versus rotational velocity, i.e., $\\ln L$ vs $\\ln v_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nConsider a simplified model of a disk galaxy to investigate how its position on the Tully-Fisher diagram shifts when its interstellar gas is converted into stars. A spiral galaxy initially consists of a stellar disk with mass $M_*$ and an exponential scale radius $R_*$, and a gas disk with mass $M_g$ and scale radius $R_g$.\n\nAssume the following for your model:\n1.  The galaxy's total baryonic mass, $M_b = M_* + M_g$, and total baryonic angular momentum, $J_b = J_* + J_g$, are conserved when the gas is converted into stars.\n2.  The angular momentum of a single exponential disk with mass $M_d$ and scale radius $R_d$ is given by $J_d = k M_d^{3/2} R_d^{1/2}$, where $k$ is a constant.\n3.

The square of the maximum rotational velocity, $v_{\\text{max}}^2$, is given by the linear sum of contributions from the stellar and gas disks, with each contribution proportional to the disk's mass divided by its scale radius.

So, the initial luminosity is $L_i = (1-f_g)M_b/\\Upsilon_*$.\nIn the final state, all gas is converted to stars, so the final stellar mass is $M_{*,f} = M_b$.

Its angular momentum is:\n$$ J_{b,f} = k M_b^{3/2} (R_b')^{1/2} $$\nBy conservation of angular momentum, $J_{b,f} = J_{b,i}$:\n$$ k M_b^{3/2} (R_b')^{1/2} = k M_*^{3/2}R_*^{1/2} + k M_g^{3/2}R_g^{1/2} $$\nWe solve for $R_b'$:\n$$ (R_b')^{1/2} = \\frac{M_*^{3/2}R_*^{1/2} + M_g^{3/2}R_g^{1/2}}{M_b^{3/2}} $$\n$$ R_b' = \\left(\\frac{M_*^{3/2}R_*^{1/2} + M_g^{3/2}R_g^{1/2}}{M_b^{3/2}}\\right)^2 $$\nNow, we express this in terms of $f_g = M_g/M_b$ and $\\gamma = R_g/R_*$.
