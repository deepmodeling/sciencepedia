One proposed theoretical resolution involves modifying the nature of dark energy, replacing the cosmological constant ($\\Lambda$, with equation of state parameter $w=-1$) with a \"phantom\" dark energy component characterized by a constant equation of state parameter $w  -1$.\n\nThis problem explores this possibility within a simplified framework. Consider a family of flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological models containing radiation, matter (baryonic and dark), and a dark energy component with a constant equation of state parameter $w$. The expansion rate is described by the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, where $z$ is the redshift. It is convenient to use the dimensionless Hubble parameter $h$, defined by $H_0 = 100h \\text{ km s}^{-1} \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the physical density parameters $\\omega_i = \\Omega_i h^2$, where $\\Omega_i$ are the standard density fractions at $z=0$.\n\nThe Friedmann equation can be written as:\n$$H(z)^2 = (100 \\text{ km s}^{-1} \\text{Mpc}^{-1})^2 \\left[ \\omega_r(1+z)^4 + \\omega_m(1+z)^3 + (h^2 - \\omega_m - \\omega_r)(1+z)^{3(1+w)} \\right]$$\nwhere we have enforced spatial flatness ($\\Omega_k=0$, so $\\Omega_m + \\Omega_r + \\Omega_{DE} = 1$).\n\nA key observable from the CMB is the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination ($z=z_*$), $\\theta_s = r_s/D_A(z_*)$. The sound horizon $r_s$ depends on pre-recombination physics and is determined by $\\omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\\omega_b$. The comoving angular diameter distance to the last-scattering surface, $D_A(z_*)$, is given by:\n$$D_A(z_*) = c \\int_0^{z_*} \\frac{dz'}{H(z')}$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nTo resolve the Hubble tension, a new model must match the late-universe value of $H_0$ while preserving the early-universe CMB observables. We assume that the physical densities $\\omega_m$ and $\\omega_r$, and thus the sound horizon $r_s$, are fixed by early universe physics. Therefore, to keep $\\theta_s$ constant, the angular diameter distance $D_A(z_*)$ must also remain unchanged between different cosmological models.\n\nLet's denote the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model that fits the Planck CMB data with parameters $(h_P, w=-1)$ and the proposed phantom energy model that fits the local SH0ES data with parameters $(h_S, w  -1)$. The condition to reconcile the measurements is $D_A(z_*; h_P, w=-1) = D_A(z_*; h_S, w)$.\n\nFor this problem, we will neglect the contribution of radiation to the expansion history for the calculation of $D_A(z_*)$, as it is subdominant over most of the integration range. Further, assume that a detailed analysis of the resulting integral shows that for the range of parameters of interest, the comoving angular diameter distance to recombination, $D_A(z_*)$, can be approximated by the following analytical form:\n$$D_A(h, w) \\approx \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{h^2 - \\omega_m}} \\sqrt{-w}$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant that depends on $\\omega_m$ and fundamental constants, but not on $h$ or $w$.\n\nGiven the fixed physical matter density $\\omega_m$, a Hubble parameter $h_P$ from the CMB analysis, and a larger Hubble parameter $h_S$ from local measurements ($h_S  h_P$), determine the required value of the phantom energy equation of state parameter $w$ that would make the two measurements consistent under the assumptions stated above.
