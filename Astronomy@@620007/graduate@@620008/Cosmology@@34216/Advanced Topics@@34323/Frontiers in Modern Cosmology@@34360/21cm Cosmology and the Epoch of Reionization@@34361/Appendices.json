The observed spatial distribution of the signal is not a pure reflection of the underlying matter density; it is distorted by the peculiar velocities of the gas clouds along our line of sight, an effect known as redshift-space distortions (RSD). This problem focuses on modeling the \"Finger-of-God\" effect, a non-linear distortion caused by random motions inside collapsed structures. Calculating its leading-order impact on the power spectrum monopole is an essential step toward building the accurate theoretical models needed to extract information about cosmic growth and the laws of gravity from 21cm surveys [@problem_id:806877].", "problem": "In 21cm cosmology, the spatial fluctuations in the brightness temperature of the 21cm line from neutral hydrogen provide a powerful probe of the early universe, including the Epoch of Reionization.

This effect, known as redshift-space distortions (RSD), anisotropically enhances the clustering signal. At linear order in perturbation theory, the redshift-space 21cm fluctuation power spectrum is given by the Kaiser formula:\n$$ P_{s}^{\\text{lin}}(k, \\mu) = (b + f\\mu^2)^2 P_L(k) $$\nwhere $P_L(k)$ is the linear matter power spectrum, $f$ is the linear growth rate of cosmic structures, and $\\mu$ is the cosine of the angle between the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ and the line of sight.\n\nOn smaller, non-linear scales, the random motions of gas within collapsed objects (virialized halos) are no longer negligible. These motions lead to an additional distortion known as the Finger-of-God (FoG) effect, which suppresses power along the line of sight.
