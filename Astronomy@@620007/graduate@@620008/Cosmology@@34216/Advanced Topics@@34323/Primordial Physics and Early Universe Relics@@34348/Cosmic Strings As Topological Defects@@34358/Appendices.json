The test string supports various vibrational modes. We are interested in a specific quantum state of the test string corresponding to a fundamental, circularly polarized oscillation in the $xy$-plane (the plane transverse to the string's length).

Due to the conical nature of spacetime, the local reference frame of the test string is rotated upon its return. This induces a geometric phase shift in the quantum state of the vibrational mode, an effect known as the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect.\n\nCalculate the total phase shift, $\\delta\\Phi$, acquired by the wavefunction of this vibrational mode after completing one full loop around the source string.
