The CP violation required for baryogenesis arises from a complex A-term, $A = |A|e^{i\\delta_A}$.\n\nIn the early universe, when $H \\gg m_\\phi$, the negative Hubble-induced mass term drives the field to a large value, $\\phi_0$. As the universe expands and $H$ decreases, the field is trapped at this large value until $H$ drops to the order of $m_\\phi$. At this point, defined by $H_{osc} = m_\\phi$, the field begins to oscillate around the minimum of its potential at $\\Phi=0$. The amplitude of the field at the onset of these oscillations, $\\phi_{osc}$, is determined by the balance of the potential terms at high energy and is given by the relation:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\phi_{osc}}{M_{Pl}}\\right)^{2n-4} = \\frac{c}{C_D(n-1)} \\left(\\frac{m_\\phi}{M_{Pl}}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{|\\lambda|^2}\n$$\n\nThe CP-violating phase $\\delta_A$ imparts a kick to the angular motion of the field as it begins to oscillate, generating a net baryon number.
