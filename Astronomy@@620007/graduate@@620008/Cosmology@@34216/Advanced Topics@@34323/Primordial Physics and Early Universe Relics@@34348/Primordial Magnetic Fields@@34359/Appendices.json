Various theoretical mechanisms for generating primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) rely on processes that sustain a constant *physical* magnetic field strength, $B_{phys}$, against the exponential dilution from the expansion.\n\nA fundamental limit on the strength of such a generated magnetic field arises from the Schwinger effect: the spontaneous creation of charged particle-antiparticle pairs from the vacuum, seeded by the strong background field. This pair production drains energy from the field generation mechanism, creating a \"backreaction\" that limits the maximum attainable field strength.\n\nIn a de Sitter background, a strong magnetic field can cause prolific production of charged particles even without an explicit electric field.
