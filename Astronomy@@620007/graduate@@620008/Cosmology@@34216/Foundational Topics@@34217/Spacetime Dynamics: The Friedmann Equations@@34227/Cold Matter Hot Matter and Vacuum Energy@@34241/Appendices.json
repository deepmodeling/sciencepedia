The dynamics are governed by the Friedmann equations, which relate the expansion rate of the universe to its energy content. The total energy density $\\rho$ is composed of several components, primarily non-relativistic matter (cold matter), radiation (hot matter), and vacuum energy (a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$).\n\nThe energy density of each component scales with the scale factor $a(t)$ as follows:\n-   Radiation (relativistic particles): $\\rho_r(a) = \\rho_{r,0} a^{-4}$\n-   Matter (non-relativistic particles): $\\rho_m(a) = \\rho_{m,0} a^{-3}$\n-   Vacuum energy (cosmological constant): $\\rho_\\Lambda(a) = \\rho_{\\Lambda,0}$\n\nHere, the subscript '0' denotes the value of a quantity at the present cosmological time, where the scale factor is normalized to $a_0 = 1$. It is convenient to express these densities in terms of the present-day critical density $\\rho_{c,0}$ via the density parameters $\\Omega_{i,0} = \\rho_{i,0} / \\rho_{c,0}$.\n\nThe expansion of the universe is quantified by the number of e-folds, $N$, which is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the scale factor at two different times, $N = \\ln(a_f/a_i)$.\n\nTwo particularly important moments in the thermal history of the universe are:\n1.  **Matter-Radiation Equality:** The epoch, characterized by a scale factor $a_{eq}$, when the energy density of matter equaled that of radiation.\n2.  **Matter-Vacuum Equality:** The epoch, characterized by a scale factor $a_{m\\Lambda}$, when the energy density of matter equaled that of the vacuum energy.\n\nYour task is to calculate the total number of e-folds of expansion, $N$, that the universe underwent between the time of matter-radiation equality and the time of matter-vacuum equality.
