The first group is a set of \"background\" species that remain relativistic throughout the epoch of interest.

The second group consists of a single, massive, hypothetical particle species, X, which is initially in thermal equilibrium with the background bath. The effective contribution of species X to the total relativistic degrees of freedom when it is relativistic is $g_{X,\\text{eff}}$.\n\nThe universe expands and cools. Initially, at a temperature $T_i$ high enough such that species X is fully relativistic ($k_B T_i \\gg m_X c^2$), the entire system is at a uniform temperature.

This practice develops your skills in perturbation analysis and showcases how BBN serves as a powerful probe of the universe's dynamics at very early times.", "problem": "During the era of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the early universe was dominated by radiation. The expansion rate, described by the Hubble parameter $H$, is governed by the Friedmann equation, $H^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3} \\rho$, where $\\rho$ is the total energy density and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nIn the standard cosmological model, the total energy density is composed of relativistic particles (photons, neutrinos, and electron-positron pairs), $\\rho = \\rho_r = \\frac{\\pi^2}{30} g_* T^4$, where $g_*$ is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nThe synthesis of light elements is highly sensitive to the expansion rate when the universe was a few minutes old. The primordial abundance of Helium-4, $Y_P$, is primarily set by the neutron-to-proton ratio ($n/p$) at the time of \"freeze-out\". Freeze-out occurs when the rate of weak interactions converting neutrons to protons, $\\Gamma_{n \\leftrightarrow p}$, drops below the expansion rate $H$. After freeze-out, the neutron-to-proton ratio evolves mainly through free neutron decay until the onset of nucleosynthesis, when nearly all available neutrons are rapidly incorporated into Helium-4.\n\nConsider a non-standard cosmological scenario where a primordial magnetic field (PMF) contributes to the total energy density. This magnetic field is tangled and on average behaves as a fluid with an energy density $\\rho_B$ that scales with the scale factor $a$ as $\\rho_B \\propto a^{-4}$, identical to the scaling of radiation. The ratio of the magnetic energy density to the radiation energy density, $\\xi = \\rho_B / \\rho_r$, is therefore a constant during the radiation era. Assume $\\xi$ is a small, positive constant. The total energy density is now $\\rho_{\\text{tot}} = \\rho_r + \\rho_B$.\n\nThe following relations and approximations should be used:\n1.  The weak interaction rate is given by $\\Gamma_{n \\leftrightarrow p}(T) = C T^5$, where $C$ is a constant.\n2.  The neutron-proton freeze-out occurs at a temperature $T_f$ determined by the condition $\\Gamma_{n \\leftrightarrow p}(T_f) = H(T_f)$.\n3.  The neutron-to-proton ratio at freeze-out is given by the Boltzmann factor $x_f \\equiv (n/p)|_{T_f} = \\exp(-Q/T_f)$, where $Q$ is the neutron-proton mass-energy difference.\n4.  In a radiation-dominated universe, the cosmic time $t$ is related to the Hubble parameter by $t = \\frac{1}{2H}$.\n5.  Nucleosynthesis, the formation of Helium-4, happens at a fixed temperature $T_{\\text{BBN}}$, which occurs at a time $t_{\\text{BBN}}$. For simplicity, assume the time elapsed between freeze-out and nucleosynthesis is well-approximated by $t_{\\text{BBN}}$.\n6.  Free neutrons decay with a mean lifetime $\\tau_n$.
