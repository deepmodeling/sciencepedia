This practice helps solidify the relationships between these fundamental parameters and builds intuition for how a star's properties translate into its observable motion across the celestial sphere. [@problem_id:894694]", "problem": "A distant star is observed from the solar system. Its position and properties are characterized by several astrometric parameters.\n\nThe trigonometric parallax, $p$, is half the maximum apparent angular shift of a star due to the Earth's orbital motion. For small angles, the distance $d$ to the star is related to its parallax by $d = A/p$, where $A$ is one astronomical unit (the radius of Earth's orbit). By convention, if $p$ is measured in arcseconds, the distance $d$ in units of parsecs (pc) is given by $d = 1/p$. One parsec is the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond.\n\nThe star has a physical radius $R$. As seen from Earth, this physical dimension corresponds to an angular radius, $\\alpha$. For a star at distance $d$, the small-angle approximation gives $\\alpha \\approx R/d$. The angular diameter is thus $\\Theta_D = 2\\alpha$.\n\nThe star also exhibits proper motion, which is its angular velocity across the celestial sphere as seen from the solar system's barycenter. The proper motion is described by two components: $\\mu_\\alpha$ in the direction of increasing right ascension ($\\alpha$) and $\\mu_\\delta$ in the direction of increasing declination ($\\delta$). On the spherical celestial grid, a change in right ascension $\\Delta\\alpha$ corresponds to an angular arc length of $(\\Delta\\alpha)\\cos\\delta$. Consequently, the total proper motion $\\mu$ is the magnitude of the vector sum of two orthogonal velocity components: one along the parallel of declination and one along the meridian.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nA star is located at a declination $\\delta$. It has a trigonometric parallax $p$, a proper motion in right ascension $\\mu_\\alpha$, and a proper motion in declination $\\mu_\\delta$. The ratio of the star's physical radius $R$ to the astronomical unit $A$ is given by the dimensionless quantity $\\rho = R/A$.\n\nAssuming all relevant angles are small, determine the time, $\\Delta t$, it would take for the star to move across the celestial sphere by an angular distance equal to its own apparent angular diameter. The parallax $p$ and proper motion components $\\mu_\\alpha$ and $\\mu_\\delta$ are given in units of arcseconds and arcseconds per unit time, respectively. Express your final answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $p, \\rho, \\mu_\\alpha, \\mu_\\delta,$ and $\\delta$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the time $\\Delta t$ required for a star to travel an angular distance equal to its own angular diameter, $\\Theta_D$. This time can be found by dividing the angular distance by the total angular speed, which is the magnitude of the proper motion, $\\mu$.\n\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{\\Theta_D}{\\mu}\n$$\n\nWe need to derive expressions for the angular diameter $\\Theta_D$ and the total proper motion $\\mu$ in terms of the given parameters.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the angular diameter $\\Theta_D$**\n\nThe angular radius $\\alpha$ of the star is given by the small-angle approximation $\\alpha \\approx R/d$, where $R$ is the star's physical radius and $d$ is its distance from Earth. The angular diameter is twice the angular radius, so $\\Theta_D = 2\\alpha \\approx 2R/d$.\n\nThe problem provides the ratio $\\rho = R/A$, where $A$ is the astronomical unit. So, we can write $R = \\rho A$.\n\nThe distance $d$ is related to the parallax $p$. By definition, a star at a distance of 1 parsec (pc) has a parallax of 1 arcsecond (''). Thus, for a parallax $p$ in arcseconds, the distance $d$ in parsecs is $d~[\\text{pc}] = 1/p~['']$.\n\nTo maintain consistent units for $R$ and $d$, we must express $d$ in terms of the astronomical unit $A$. The definition of the parsec is the distance at which 1 AU subtends an angle of 1 arcsecond.\n$$\n1~\\text{pc} = \\frac{1~A}{\\tan(1'')} \\approx \\frac{1~A}{1''~\\text{in radians}}\n$$\nLet's express the distance $d$ in astronomical units:\n$$\nd~[A] = d~[\\text{pc}] \\times \\frac{1~\\text{pc}}{1~A} = \\left(\\frac{1}{p~['']}\\right) \\times \\frac{1~A/\\tan(1'')}{1~A} = \\frac{1}{p~[''] \\tan(1'')}\n$$\nNow we can compute the angular diameter in radians:\n$$\n\\Theta_D~[\\text{rad}] = \\frac{2R}{d} = \\frac{2\\rho A}{ \\frac{A}{p~[''] \\tan(1'')} } = 2\\rho p~[''] \\tan(1'')\n$$\nTo express the angular diameter in arcseconds, we note that for a small angle $\\theta$, $\\theta~[\\text{rad}] \\approx \\theta~[''] \\times \\tan(1'')$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Theta_D~[''] = 2\\rho p~['']\n$$\nThe angular diameter of the star in arcseconds is $2\\rho p$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total proper motion $\\mu$**\n\nThe proper motion is given by two components: $\\mu_\\alpha = d\\alpha/dt$ and $\\mu_\\delta = d\\delta/dt$.\nThe component $\\mu_\\delta$ represents an angular velocity along a meridian of the celestial sphere.\nThe component $\\mu_\\alpha$ is a rate of change in the right ascension coordinate. At a declination $\\delta$, a differential change in right ascension $d\\alpha$ corresponds to a differential arc length on the celestial sphere of $ds_\\alpha = d\\alpha \\cos\\delta$. The angular velocity component along the parallel of declination is therefore $v_\\alpha = (d\\alpha/dt)\\cos\\delta = \\mu_\\alpha \\cos\\delta$.\n\nThe two components of motion, along the meridian and along the parallel of declination, are orthogonal. The magnitude of the total proper motion vector, $\\mu$, is found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$\n\\mu = \\sqrt{v_\\alpha^2 + v_\\delta^2} = \\sqrt{(\\mu_\\alpha \\cos\\delta)^2 + \\mu_\\delta^2}\n$$\nIf $\\mu_\\alpha$ and $\\mu_\\delta$ are given in arcseconds per unit time, then $\\mu$ is also in arcseconds per unit time.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the timescale $\\Delta t$**\n\nNow we combine the results from the previous steps. The time required for the star to travel its angular diameter is:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{\\Theta_D~['']}{\\mu~[''/\\text{time unit}]}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $\\Theta_D$ and $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{2\\rho p}{\\sqrt{(\\mu_\\alpha \\cos\\delta)^2 + \\mu_\\delta^2}}\n$$\nIf the proper motion components are given in arcseconds/year, the resulting timescale $\\Delta t$ will be in years.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{2 \\rho p}{\\sqrt{(\\mu_\\alpha \\cos\\delta)^2 + \\mu_\\delta^2}}} $$", "id": "894694"}, {"introduction": "Moving from ideal values to the realities of observation, this problem delves into the crucial topic of uncertainty.
