The physics governing these peaks is intimately tied to the epoch of recombination, during which free electrons and protons combined to form neutral hydrogen. The speed and duration of this process depend critically on the number densities of the reacting particles.\n\nThe total baryon density, $\\rho_b$, is composed of hydrogen and helium, with a primordial helium mass fraction denoted by $Y_p$. Thus, the number density of hydrogen nuclei, $n_H$, is related to the total baryon density by $n_H = (1-Y_p)\\rho_b/m_p$, where $m_p$ is the proton mass. In contrast, a hypothetical universe without helium would have $n_H = \\rho_b/m_p$.\n\nAfter recombination is largely complete, a small residual fraction of free electrons remains. A key result from detailed calculations, which you can assume to be true, is that the final residual number of free electrons per hydrogen nucleus, $X_e \\equiv n_{e, \\text{res}}/n_{H, \\text{tot}}$, is determined almost entirely by the hydrogen recombination process. Its value is well-approximated by the result for a pure hydrogen universe having the same hydrogen number density history, $n_{H, \\text{tot}}(z)$. The freeze-out abundance $X_e$ is inversely proportional to the hydrogen number density at the time of recombination.\n\nConsider an analyst who attempts to infer the value of the baryon density from CMB observations. Our universe has a true baryon density $(\\Omega_b h^2)_{\\text{true}}$ and a helium mass fraction $Y_p$. The analyst, however, uses a simplified cosmological model which incorrectly assumes the universe is composed purely of hydrogen (i.e., assumes $Y_p=0$).
