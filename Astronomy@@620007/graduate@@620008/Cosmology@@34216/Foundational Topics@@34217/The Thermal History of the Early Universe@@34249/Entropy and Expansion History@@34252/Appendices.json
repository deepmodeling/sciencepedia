By modeling the effects of non-ideal energy transfer and variations in fundamental constants, you will develop a deeper appreciation for how the universe's thermal history is imprinted on its fossil relics.", "problem": "In the standard cosmological model, the temperature of the cosmic neutrino background ($T_\\nu$) is related to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ($T_\\gamma$) by the expression $T_\\nu/T_\\gamma = (4/11)^{1/3}$. This result is derived assuming that neutrinos decouple from the primordial plasma instantaneously at a temperature $T_D$, followed by the annihilation of electron-positron pairs which transfers their entropy entirely to the photons, thus heating them relative to the already decoupled neutrinos.\n\nIn reality, neutrino decoupling is not instantaneous and some energy is transferred from the annihilating $e^\\pm$ pairs to the neutrinos. This leads to a slightly higher neutrino temperature than the standard prediction. We can parametrize this corrected ratio as $R_0 = (T_{\\nu}/T_{\\gamma})_0 = (4/11)^{1/3}(1+\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small, positive, dimensionless constant representing the correction from non-ideal effects in our universe.\n\nLet's model this correction with the following assumptions:\n1.  The universe is a homogeneous and isotropic FLRW spacetime. The primordial plasma consists of photons ($\\gamma$), electrons ($e^-$), positrons ($e^+$), and three families of neutrinos ($\\nu$).\n2.  The effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom for entropy is $g_{\\star S}$. For photons (bosons), $g_\\gamma=2$. For electrons/positrons (fermions), $g_{e^\\pm}=4$. For the three families of neutrinos and antineutrinos (fermions), $g_\\nu=6$. The entropy density of a species $i$ is $s_i \\propto g_{\\star S,i} T_i^3$. For fermions, the contribution to $g_{\\star S}$ is scaled by a factor of $7/8$ relative to bosons. Thus, just before $e^\\pm$ annihilation, the plasma in thermal contact has $g_{\\star S, \\gamma e} = g_\\gamma + (7/8)g_{e^\\pm} = 11/2$.\n3.  The entropy of the $e^\\pm$ pairs, $S_{e^\\pm}$, is released during annihilation. We model the non-ideal energy transfer by assuming that a fraction $f_\\nu$ of this entropy is transferred to the neutrinos, while the remaining fraction $(1-f_\\nu)$ is transferred to the photons.\n4.  Physical models suggest that this fraction $f_\\nu$ depends on the fine-structure constant $\\alpha$ and the Fermi constant $G_F$ as $f_\\nu \\propto G_F^2/\\alpha^2$. We will assume other parameters like the electron mass $m_e$ are held constant.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where the fine-structure constant during the epoch of $e^\\pm$ annihilation had a value $\\alpha' = \\beta \\alpha_0$, where $\\alpha_0$ is its standard value in our universe and $\\beta$ is a constant.
