By calculating the sensitivity of the final ${}^{7}\\text{Li}$ abundance to the $\\text{D}(p,\\gamma){}^{3}\\text{He}$ reaction, you will develop a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of the network and how changes in one sector can have counter-intuitive consequences for another, specifically by altering the late-time neutron budget available to destroy ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$.", "problem": "The standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) model faces a discrepancy known as the \"Cosmological Lithium Problem,\" where theoretical predictions for the primordial abundance of ${}^{7}\\text{Li}$ are significantly higher than observational constraints. The dominant production channel for ${}^{7}\\text{Li}$ is the electron-capture decay of ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$ (${}^{7}\\text{Be} + e^{-} \\to {}^{7}\\text{Li} + \\nu_e$), which occurs long after the main BBN epoch. Therefore, the primordial ${}^{7}\\text{Li}$ abundance is determined by the final abundance of ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$.\n\nWe wish to investigate the sensitivity of the final ${}^{7}\\text{Li}$ abundance to variations in the $\\text{D}(p,\\gamma){}^{3}\\text{He}$ reaction rate. This reaction is one of the primary ways deuterium is processed. An increased rate of $\\text{D}(p,\\gamma){}^{3}\\text{He}$ could affect the ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$ abundance in two main ways:\n1.  **Direct effect:** Potentially increasing the production of ${}^{3}\\text{He}$, which then fuses with ${}^{4}\\text{He}$ to produce more ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$.\n2.  **Indirect effect:** Reducing the amount of deuterium available at later times. Since deuterium captures free neutrons via $\\text{D}(n,\\gamma){}^{3}\\text{H}$, a lower deuterium abundance leaves more neutrons available to destroy ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$ via the ${}^{7}\\text{Be}(n,p){}^{7}\\text{Li}$ channel (followed by rapid destruction of the resulting ${}^{7}\\text{Li}$).\n\nThis problem focuses exclusively on the **indirect effect**. We define the sensitivity of the final ${}^{7}\\text{Li}$ mass fraction, $Y_7$, to the thermally averaged reaction rate $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{Dp}$ of $\\text{D}(p,\\gamma){}^{3}\\text{He}$ as the dimensionless logarithmic derivative:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\partial \\ln Y_7}{\\partial \\ln \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{Dp}} $$\nTo compute $S$, adopt the following simplified model:\n\n1.  The final ${}^{7}\\text{Li}$ mass fraction is directly proportional to the final ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$ number abundance, $X_{{}^{7}\\text{Be},f}$, after the phase of neutron destruction has concluded.\n2.  To isolate the indirect effect, assume the initial abundance of ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$ produced before this destruction phase, $X_{{}^{7}\\text{Be},0}$, is independent of $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{Dp}$.\n3.  The destruction of ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$ is a small effect, allowing for the approximation $\\ln(X_{{}^{7}\\text{Be},f}/X_{{}^{7}\\text{Be},0}) \\approx -(X_{{}^{7}\\text{Be},0} - X_{{}^{7}\\text{Be},f})/X_{{}^{7}\\text{Be},0}$.\n4.  The total amount of ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$ destroyed, $\\Delta X_{{}^{7}\\text{Be}} = X_{{}^{7}\\text{Be},0} - X_{{}^{7}\\text{Be},f}$, is equal to the total number of late-time neutrons captured by ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$.\n5.  The competition for these late-time neutrons is solely between capture on deuterium (via $\\text{D}(n,\\gamma){}^{3}\\text{H}$, rate $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{Dn}$) and capture on beryllium-7 (via ${}^{7}\\text{Be}(n,p){}^{7}\\text{Li}$, rate $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{nBe}$).\n6.  The abundance of deuterium present during this late-time capture epoch, $X_D$, is inversely proportional to the rate of its primary destruction channel, $\\text{D}(p,\\gamma){}^{3}\\text{He}$. That is, $X_D \\propto 1/\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{Dp}$.\n\nThe physical conditions of this epoch are summarized by two dimensionless parameters:\n-   The ratio of the total abundance of late-time free neutrons available for capture, $X_{n, \\text{total}}$, to the initial ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$ abundance: $\\eta_{nBe} = X_{n, \\text{total}} / X_{{}^{7}\\text{Be},0} = 3/5$.\n-   The ratio of the neutron capture rate on ${}^{7}\\text{Be}$ to that on deuterium, evaluated using the standard (unperturbed) BBN abundances and reaction rates: $\\xi_0 = \\frac{X_{{}^{7}\\text{Be},0} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{nBe}}{X_{D,std} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{Dn}} = 1/5$.\n\nUsing this model and the provided parameters, calculate the sensitivity $S$.", "solution": "1.
