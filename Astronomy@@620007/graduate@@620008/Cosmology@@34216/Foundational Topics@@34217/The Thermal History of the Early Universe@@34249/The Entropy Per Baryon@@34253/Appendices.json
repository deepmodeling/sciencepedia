Understanding this speed is crucial, as it sets the physical scale of the sound horizon at recombination, a feature imprinted on the cosmos as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO).", "problem": "In the early universe, before the era of recombination (at a redshift $z > 1100$), baryons (protons and helium nuclei) and photons were tightly coupled through Thomson scattering, forming a single photon-baryon fluid. Small density perturbations in this primordial plasma propagated as sound waves, a phenomenon whose effects are now observed as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The characteristic scale of these oscillations, which is imprinted on both the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the large-scale structure of the universe, is determined by the speed of sound in this fluid.\n\nConsider this photon-baryon fluid as a mixture of two components: a relativistic photon gas and a non-relativistic baryon gas.
