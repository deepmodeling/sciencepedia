The synthesis of Helium-4 ($^4$He), the second most abundant element, is critically dependent on the abundance of deuterium (D). At very high temperatures, any newly formed deuterium is immediately destroyed by high-energy photons (photodissociation), a phenomenon known as the \"deuterium bottleneck\".

The characteristic rate of $^4$He production, $\\mathcal{R}(t)$, is determined by a competition between the decreasing density of reactants due to cosmic expansion and the increasing stability of deuterium as the universe cools.
