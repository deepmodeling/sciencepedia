To find this, we must first determine the speed $v$ of the beam and then apply the Lorentz transformations for time.\n\nFirst, let's find the speed $v$. In the laboratory frame S, the beam is moving and thus its length is contracted. The proper length of the beam is $L_0$. Its length $L'$ in frame S is given by the length contraction formula:\n$$L' = \\frac{L_0}{\\gamma}$$\nwhere $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe problem states that for the beam to \"just fit\" inside the chamber, its contracted length $L'$ must be equal to the proper length of the chamber, $L_c$.\n$$L' = L_c$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\frac{L_0}{\\gamma} = \\frac{24}{25}L_0$$\nSolving for the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{25}{24}$$\nNow we can find the speed $v$ from the definition of $\\gamma$.\n$$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2}$$\n$$1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} = \\left(\\frac{24}{25}\\right)^2 = \\frac{576}{625}$$\n$$\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{576}{625} = \\frac{625 - 576}{625} = \\frac{49}{625}$$\nTaking the square root gives the speed as a fraction of the speed of light:\n$$\\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{49}{625}} = \\frac{7}{25}$$\nSo, the speed of the beam is $v = \\frac{7}{25}c$.\n\nNext, we establish the spacetime coordinates of Event A and Event B in the lab frame S. Let the chamber entrance be at position $x=0$ and the exit be at $x=L_c$. Since the events are simultaneous in S, they occur at the same time, which we'll call $t_{fit}$.\nTo find $t_{fit}$, let's consider the motion of the beam's front tip. Let's say it passes the entrance ($x=0$) at time $t=0$. Its position at any time $t$ is then $x_{front}(t) = vt$. Event A occurs when the front tip reaches the exit, $x=L_c$. So, $vt_{fit} = L_c$, which gives $t_{fit} = L_c/v$.\nThe coordinates of the two events in frame S are therefore:\n- Event A (front tip at exit): $(t_A, x_A) = (t_{fit}, L_c) = (L_c/v, L_c)$\n- Event B (rear tip at entrance): $(t_B, x_B) = (t_{fit}, 0) = (L_c/v, 0)$\n\nNow, we use the Lorentz transformation to find the times of these events in the beam's frame S'. The transformation for the time coordinate from S to S' is:\n$$t' = \\gamma \\left(t - \\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right)$$\nFor Event A:\n$$t'_A = \\gamma \\left(t_A - \\frac{vx_A}{c^2}\\right) = \\gamma \\left(\\frac{L_c}{v} - \\frac{vL_c}{c^2}\\right)$$\nFor Event B:\n$$t'_B = \\gamma \\left(t_B - \\frac{vx_B}{c^2}\\right) = \\gamma \\left(\\frac{L_c}{v} - \\frac{v(0)}{c^2}\\right) = \\gamma \\frac{L_c}{v}$$\nThe time interval between the events in frame S' is $\\Delta t' = t'_A - t'_B$.\n$$\\Delta t' = \\gamma \\left(\\frac{L_c}{v} - \\frac{vL_c}{c^2}\\right) - \\gamma \\frac{L_c}{v} = -\\frac{\\gamma v L_c}{c^2}$$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this time interval:\n$$|\\Delta t'| = \\frac{\\gamma v L_c}{c^2}$$\nNow, we substitute the values we found for $\\gamma$, $v$, and $L_c$:\n$\\gamma = 25/24$, $v = (7/25)c$, and $L_c = (24/25)L_0$.\n$$|\\Delta t'| = \\left(\\frac{25}{24}\\right) \\frac{(\\frac{7}{25}c)}{c^2} \\left(\\frac{24}{25}L_0\\right)$$\n$$|\\Delta t'| = \\left(\\frac{25}{24}\\right) \\left(\\frac{7}{25}\\right) \\left(\\frac{24}{25}\\right) \\frac{L_0}{c}$$\nWe can cancel terms: the $(25/24)$ from $\\gamma$ cancels with $(24/25)$ from the other factors.\n$$|\\Delta t'| = \\frac{7}{25} \\frac{L_0}{c}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in units of $L_0/c$.
