Alex remains on Earth for the entire duration of the experiment. On their 25th birthday, Ben and Chloe immediately depart on separate starships. Ben's starship travels towards the star system Alpha, while Chloe's starship travels in the exact opposite direction towards the star system Omega.\n\nFrom the perspective of an observer on Earth, both Alpha and Omega are located at an equal distance $L$ from Earth. Both starships travel at a constant speed $v = 0.8c$ relative to Earth, where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.

This classic problem [@problem_id:902563] presents a situation where one observer sees an object perfectly fit within a given length, while another observer argues it is impossible.

They observe that the train exactly fits within the tunnel at a particular instant in their frame. This means the following two events are simultaneous in the lab frame S:\n\n*   **Event A:** The front of the train passes the detector at the tunnel exit, D2.\n*   **Event B:** The rear of the train passes the detector at the tunnel entrance, D1.\n\nFrom the perspective of an observer on the train (the train's rest frame, S'), the train has its proper length $L_0$, while the tunnel is moving and its length is contracted to $L_T' = L_T/\\gamma = L_0/\\gamma^2$. Since $L_0 > L_0/\\gamma^2$, the observer on the train argues that the train is longer than the tunnel and can never be fully contained within it.\n\nTo resolve this paradox, calculate the time interval $\\Delta t' = t'_A - t'_B$ between Event A and Event B as measured by an observer in the train's rest frame S'.
