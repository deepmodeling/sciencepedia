This object travels at a constant relativistic speed $v$ relative to a laboratory. The direction of the object's velocity is parallel to one of its diagonals. An observer in the laboratory measures the area of this moving object. A second observer, traveling with the object, measures its area to be $A_0 = L_0^2$. Determine the area $A$ of the object as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n\nYour answer should be a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $L_0$, $v$, and the speed of light in vacuum, $c$.", "solution": "Let $S'$ be the rest frame of the square object and $S$ be the laboratory frame. In the rest frame $S'$, the object is a square of side length $L_0$. The area in this frame is $A_0 = L_0^2$.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system in the rest frame $S'$ to make the calculation straightforward. Since the motion in the lab frame $S$ is parallel to one of the diagonals, we should align this diagonal with an axis in $S'$. Let's align the diagonal with the $x'$-axis and center the square at the origin of the $x'y'$ plane.\n\nThe length of the diagonal of a square with side $L_0$ is $d = \\sqrt{L_0^2 + L_0^2} = L_0\\sqrt{2}$.\nIn our chosen coordinate system, the two diagonals lie along the $x'$ and $y'$ axes. The vertices of the square are located at the ends of these diagonals. Half the length of each diagonal is $d/2 = \\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nThus, the coordinates of the four vertices in the rest frame $S'$ are:\n$V'_1 = (\\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 0)$\n$V'_2 = (-\\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 0)$\n$V'_3 = (0, \\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2})$\n$V'_4 = (0, -\\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2})$\n\nIn the laboratory frame $S$, the square moves with velocity $\\vec{v}$ parallel to one of its diagonals. Based on our coordinate choice in $S'$, we can set the velocity vector in the lab frame to be $\\vec{v} = v \\hat{x}$.\n\nAccording to the principles of special relativity, lengths are contracted only in the direction of motion. Lengths perpendicular to the direction of motion are unaffected. The contraction factor is given by $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. Any length $L'_{\\parallel}$ parallel to the velocity in the rest frame will be measured as $L_{\\parallel} = L'_{\\parallel}/\\gamma$ in the lab frame. Any length $L'_{\\perp}$ perpendicular to the velocity will be measured as $L_{\\perp} = L'_{\\perp}$.\n\nWe can find the new coordinates of the vertices in the lab frame $S$ by applying the Lorentz transformations for positions:\n$x = x'/\\gamma$\n$y = y'$\n$z = z'$\n\nApplying this to our vertices:\n$V_1$ will be at $(\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 0)$\n$V_2$ will be at $(\\frac{1}{\\gamma} (-\\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2}), 0)$\n$V_3$ will be at $(0, \\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2})$\n$V_4$ will be at $(0, -\\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2})$\n\nThe moving object, as observed in the lab frame $S$, is now a rhombus. The lengths of its diagonals can be calculated from the new vertex coordinates.\n\nThe new diagonal along the direction of motion (the x-axis), $d_x$, is the distance between $V_1$ and $V_2$:\n$$d_x = \\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2\\gamma} - (-\\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2\\gamma}) = \\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{\\gamma}$$\n\nThe new diagonal perpendicular to the direction of motion (the y-axis), $d_y$, is the distance between $V_3$ and $V_4$:\n$$d_y = \\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2} - (-\\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = L_0\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nAs expected, the diagonal parallel to the motion is contracted by the factor $\\gamma$, while the diagonal perpendicular to the motion is unchanged.\n\nThe area of a rhombus is given by half the product of its diagonals, $A = \\frac{1}{2} d_x d_y$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $d_x$ and $d_y$:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{L_0\\sqrt{2}}{\\gamma} \\right) \\left( L_0\\sqrt{2} \\right)$$\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{L_0^2 (\\sqrt{2})^2}{\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2L_0^2}{\\gamma} = \\frac{L_0^2}{\\gamma}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$A = L_0^2 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$\nThis is the area of the object as measured in the laboratory frame.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{L_0^2 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$", "id": "1836845"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the properties of objects to the timing of events, our next practice addresses a cornerstone of relativity: the breakdown of absolute simultaneity.
