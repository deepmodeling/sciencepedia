A simple pendulum, consisting of a bob of mass $m$ attached to a massless rod of length $L$, is mounted inside a sealed elevator car. The elevator is initially at rest in a uniform gravitational field with acceleration $g$. For small-angle displacements, the pendulum is observed to oscillate with a period $T_0$.\n\nAt a certain moment, the main support cable of the elevator snaps, and the emergency brakes fail to engage. The elevator car, along with the pendulum inside it, begins to fall freely. An observer and their instruments inside the elevator are unaffected by the fall and proceed to measure the new period of oscillation, $T_{fall}$, for small-angle displacements.\n\nAssuming air resistance on the elevator car is negligible, what is the value of $T_{fall}$?\n\nA. $T_{fall} = T_0$\n\nB. $T_{fall} = \\frac{T_0}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nC.

Initially, with the elevator at rest in a uniform gravitational field of magnitude $g$, the torque about the pivot due to gravity is $\\tau=-m g L \\sin\\theta$. For small angles, $\\sin\\theta\\approx\\theta$, and the moment of inertia about the pivot is $I=m L^{2}$.

By Einstein’s equivalence principle, this frame is locally equivalent to an inertial frame with an effective gravitational acceleration\n$$\ng_{\\text{eff}}=g-a.\n$$\nEquivalently, in the elevator frame the bob experiences gravity $m g$ downward and a fictitious inertial force $m a$ upward, yielding a net effective downward force $m(g-a)$ and hence an effective torque\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{eff}}=-m g_{\\text{eff}} L \\sin\\theta\\approx -m g_{\\text{eff}} L\\,\\theta.\n$$\nRepeating the rotational equation of motion,\n$$\nm L^{2}\\ddot{\\theta}=-m g_{\\text{eff}} L\\,\\theta \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\ddot{\\theta}+\\frac{g_{\\text{eff}}}{L}\\,\\theta=0.\n$$\nFor free fall, $a=g$, so $g_{\\text{eff}}=0$ and the equation becomes\n$$\n\\ddot{\\theta}=0,\n$$\nwhose general solution is $\\theta(t)=\\theta(0)+\\dot{\\theta}(0)\\,t$.

This practice demonstrates how to use the Equivalence Principle as a powerful predictive tool, bridging concepts from different areas of physics. By analyzing the Doppler shift of light in an accelerating rocket, you will derive the gravitational redshift, one of the first and most fundamental predictions of General Relativity [@problem_id:1862051].", "problem": "Consider an experiment conducted inside a tall, sealed rocket in deep space, far from any significant gravitational influences. The rocket is undergoing constant, uniform linear acceleration of magnitude $a$. A highly stable laser is fixed to the rocket's floor, and a precision detector is fixed to the ceiling, directly above the laser at a height $h$. At time $t=0$, the laser emits a pulse of light with a frequency $f_0$, as measured in the instantaneous rest frame of the laser. The detector later measures the frequency of the arriving light pulse to be $f$.\n\nBy analyzing this scenario and applying the principle of equivalence, which posits that a uniform gravitational field is locally indistinguishable from a uniformly accelerating reference frame, determine an approximate expression for the fractional change in frequency, $\\frac{\\Delta f}{f_0} = \\frac{f - f_0}{f_0}$, for light that travels vertically upward by a height $h$ within a stationary laboratory on a planet with a uniform surface gravitational field of magnitude $g$.\n\nYour final answer should be expressed in terms of $g$, $h$, and the speed of light, $c$. You should assume that the effective velocity of the detector is much less than $c$ and that the travel time of the light is very short.", "solution": "We begin by analyzing the situation in the accelerating rocket from the perspective of an inertial (non-accelerating) observer. Let the rocket begin accelerating from rest at $t=0$. At this instant, the laser on the floor emits a pulse of light upwards towards the detector on the ceiling.\n\nFirst, we determine the time it takes for the light to travel from the floor to the ceiling. The distance is $h$. Since the rocket's speed is non-relativistic and the change in position of the detector during the light's transit is negligible compared to $h$, we can approximate the time of flight, $t_{flight}$, as:\n$$t_{flight} \\approx \\frac{h}{c}$$\n\nDuring this time, the entire rocket, including the detector, has been accelerating. The velocity gained by the detector in the direction of acceleration (away from the point of emission) by the time the light pulse reaches it is given by:\n$$v_D = a \\cdot t_{flight} \\approx a \\frac{h}{c}$$\n\nThis velocity of the detector relative to the emission event causes a Doppler shift in the frequency of the light. Since the detector is moving away from the location where the light was emitted, the detected frequency $f$ will be lower than the source frequency $f_0$. For velocities much smaller than the speed of light ($v_D \\ll c$), the non-relativistic Doppler effect formula for a moving receiver is appropriate:\n$$f \\approx f_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{v_D}{c}\\right)$$\n\nWe are asked to find the fractional change in frequency, $\\frac{\\Delta f}{f_0}$, which is defined as $\\frac{f - f_0}{f_0}$. Substituting the expression for $f$ from the Doppler effect formula:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta f}{f_0} = \\frac{f_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{v_D}{c}\\right) - f_0}{f_0} = \\left(1 - \\frac{v_D}{c}\\right) - 1 = -\\frac{v_D}{c}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute our previously derived expression for the detector's velocity, $v_D \\approx \\frac{ah}{c}$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta f}{f_0} \\approx -\\frac{\\left(\\frac{ah}{c}\\right)}{c} = -\\frac{ah}{c^2}$$\n\nThis result describes the fractional frequency shift in the accelerating rocket. The problem asks for the equivalent effect in a uniform gravitational field $g$. According to the equivalence principle, the physics inside a laboratory accelerating with $a$ is indistinguishable from the physics inside a stationary laboratory in a uniform gravitational field of strength $g=a$. Therefore, we can directly replace the acceleration $a$ with the gravitational field strength $g$ to find the fractional frequency shift for light rising against gravity. This phenomenon is known as gravitational redshift.\n\n$$\\frac{\\Delta f}{f_0} = -\\frac{gh}{c^2}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the frequency decreases (the light is redshifted) as it \"climbs\" out of the gravitational potential well.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{gh}{c^{2}}}$$", "id": "1862051"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of physics rests on rigorous experimental verification.
