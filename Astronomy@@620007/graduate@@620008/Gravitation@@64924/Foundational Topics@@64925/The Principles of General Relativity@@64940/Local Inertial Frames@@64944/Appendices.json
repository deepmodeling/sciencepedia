Predicting the behavior of a sand-water mixture in this setting tests your conceptual understanding of what it truly means for the effects of gravity to vanish locally.", "problem": "An astronaut is conducting a simple fluid dynamics experiment aboard an aircraft that flies in a parabolic trajectory to simulate a weightless environment. The experiment uses a sealed, transparent, rigid container partially filled with a mixture of fine sand and water. The density of the sand particles is significantly greater than the density of the water. At the precise moment the aircraft enters the free-fall portion of its parabolic arc, the astronaut shakes the container vigorously to ensure the sand is uniformly dispersed throughout the water. The astronaut then holds the container perfectly still relative to the cabin for the entire duration of the weightless period.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the sand-water mixture as observed by the astronaut at the end of the free-fall period?\n\nA.

In the container’s comoving frame, the effective gravitational acceleration is\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{g}_{\\text{eff}}=\\boldsymbol{g}-\\boldsymbol{a}_{\\text{aircraft}}\\approx \\boldsymbol{0}.\n$$\nHydrostatics then gives a uniform pressure field, since\n$$\n\\nabla p=\\rho_{f}\\,\\boldsymbol{g}_{\\text{eff}}\\approx \\boldsymbol{0},\n$$\nso there is no buoyancy force on a particle:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F}_{b}=\\rho_{f} V \\boldsymbol{g}_{\\text{eff}}\\approx \\boldsymbol{0}.\n$$\nLikewise, the particle’s weight relative to the fluid vanishes in this frame, so there is no net body force to drive sedimentation in any direction.

This rules out options B and D.\n\nRegarding option C, there is no external central force field that would concentrate particles at the geometric center. Mutual gravitational attraction between particles is negligible compared to both thermal agitation and viscous resistance. The gravitational potential energy for two grains of mass $m$ separated by a distance on the order of their size $a$ is\n$$\nU_{g}\\sim \\frac{G m^{2}}{a},\n$$\nwhich satisfies $U_{g}\\ll k_{B}T$ for typical grain sizes and temperatures, preventing gravitational collapse.

Surface tension can shape the free surface of the water within the container, but it does not impose a bulk force that would gather the particles at the center of the volume.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that the sand remains suspended and approximately uniformly distributed throughout the water by the end of the free-fall period.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1832059"}, {"introduction": "The Equivalence Principle is explicitly local.
