This can provide a \"screening\" mechanism, hiding the effects of the scalar field in high-density environments while allowing for modifications to gravity on large, empty scales.\n\nConsider a symmetron model where the scalar field $\\phi$ has an intrinsic $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry ($\\phi \\to -\\phi$).
