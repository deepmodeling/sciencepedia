However, many alternative theories of gravity, such as scalar-tensor theories, predict additional modes of radiation.\n\nOne interesting phenomenon predicted by some scalar-tensor theories is **spontaneous scalarization**. Under certain conditions, a highly compact object like a neutron star can acquire a non-zero scalar \"charge\" $\\alpha$, even if the background scalar field is trivial. This charge measures the coupling of the star's mass to the scalar field.\n\nConsider a binary system consisting of two compact objects, A and B, with masses $m_A$ and $m_B$, respectively, in a circular orbit with orbital period $P_b$. Object A is a neutron star that has undergone spontaneous scalarization, acquiring a scalar charge $\\alpha_A$. Its companion, object B, is a non-scalarized star (e.g., a white dwarf or a less compact neutron star), so its scalar charge $\\alpha_B = 0$.\n\nThe asymmetry in scalar charges ($\\alpha_A \\neq \\alpha_B$) creates a time-varying scalar dipole moment, leading to the emission of scalar dipole radiation. This represents an additional channel for energy loss, which in turn contributes to the orbital period decay.\n\nThe total rate of change of the orbital period, $\\dot{P}_b$, is the sum of the GR contribution and the scalar dipole contribution: $\\dot{P}_b = \\dot{P}_b^{\\text{GR}} + \\dot{P}_b^{\\text{S}}$.
