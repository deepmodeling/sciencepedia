For an axially symmetric planet, the external gravitational potential can be described by a multipole expansion. Up to the quadrupole term, this potential is given by:\n$$\n\\Phi(r, \\theta) = -\\frac{GM}{r} \\left[ 1 - J_2 \\left(\\frac{R}{r}\\right)^2 P_2(\\cos\\theta) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the planet's mass, $R$ is its equatorial radius, and $r$ is the radial distance from the planet's center. The parameter $J_2$ is the dimensionless zonal harmonic coefficient representing the planet's oblateness. The angle $\\theta$ is the colatitude, measured from the axis of symmetry ($\\theta=0$ at the north pole, $\\theta=\\pi/2$ at the equator). The function $P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1)$ is the second Legendre polynomial.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nConsider a tower of height $h$ built on the surface of this planet at a constant colatitude $\\theta_0$. We assume $h \\ll R$. A light signal is emitted from the base of the tower (at radius $R$) and received at the top (at radius $R+h$).\n\nLet $z_0$ be the gravitational redshift that would be measured if the planet were a perfect sphere (i.e., if $J_2=0$).
