The total redshift $z$ is related to the cosmological redshift $z_c$ and the peculiar redshift $z_p$ by the multiplicative formula:\n$$1+z = (1+z_c)(1+z_p)$$\n\nThe cosmological redshift is determined by the change in the universe's scale factor, $a(t)$, between the time of light emission ($t_{em}$) and observation ($t_{obs}$):\n$$1+z_c = \\frac{a(t_{obs})}{a(t_{em})}$$\nThis implies that for two objects on the same line of sight, the cosmological redshift of the more distant object as seen by the nearer object follows a simple composition rule.\n\nThe peculiar redshift is a relativistic Doppler effect caused by the peculiar velocity $v$ of the object along the line of sight (with $v>0$ for recession):\n$$1+z_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light. The peculiar velocities along the same line of sight are combined using the special relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nConsider two galaxies, A and B, located along the same line of sight from an observer on Earth (E). Galaxy A is more distant than galaxy B. The total redshift of galaxy A as measured on Earth is $z_A$, and its peculiar velocity is $v_A$. The total redshift of galaxy B as measured on Earth is $z_B$, and its peculiar velocity is $v_B$. Both peculiar velocities are directed radially along the line of sight.\n\nDetermine the total redshift, $z_{A \\to B}$, of galaxy A as it would be measured by an observer in galaxy B. The observation in B is made at the cosmic time corresponding to the emission of light from B that is observed on Earth today. Express your answer in terms of $z_A$ and $z_B$.", "solution": "1. The total redshift between any two observers X and Y satisfies the multiplicative relation \n$$1+z_{X\\to Y}=(1+z_{X\\to Z})(1+z_{Z\\to Y})$$\nfor any intermediate observer Z, provided the observers are ordered X-Z-Y along the line of sight.\n2.
