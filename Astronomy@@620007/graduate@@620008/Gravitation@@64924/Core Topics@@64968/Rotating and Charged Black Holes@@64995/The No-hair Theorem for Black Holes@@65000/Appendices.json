This theorem posits that a stationary black hole is completely described to an external observer by only a very small number of physical properties.\n\nConsider an initially uncharged, non-rotating black hole. A single alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons, is captured by the black hole. Let the fundamental unit of charge be denoted by $e$. After the alpha particle crosses the event horizon and the black hole system returns to a stable, stationary state, how are the properties of the particle (specifically its electric charge and its baryon number) reflected in the state of the black hole as measured by a distant observer?\n\nSelect the statement that best describes the outcome.\n\nA. Both the electric charge and the baryon number of the particle are conserved and contribute to the black hole's externally measurable properties.\n\nB.

There is no independent parameter corresponding to global charges such as baryon number.\n\nStart with an initially uncharged, non-rotating black hole with parameters $(M_{0}, J_{0}, Q_{0}) = (M_{0}, 0, 0)$. An alpha particle has electric charge\n$$\nq_{\\alpha} = 2e\n$$\nand baryon number\n$$\nB_{\\alpha} = 4.\n$$\n\nWhen the alpha particle falls through the event horizon, the total gauge charge is conserved.

There is no Gauss-law–type surface integral at infinity that defines a conserved charge measurable by distant observers; in particular, there is no field strength $F_{B}$ for which\n$$\nB = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_{S_{\\infty}} \\ast F_{B}\n$$\ncould be defined. The no-hair theorem thus excludes independent “baryon hair.” While the total baryon number may be part of a global accounting in a microscopic theory, it does not appear as an externally measurable parameter of the stationary black hole spacetime.\n\nTherefore, after the system settles, the black hole’s externally measurable properties reflect the particle’s electric charge (the black hole carries $Q=2e$), but not its baryon number (no baryon hair).

This shedding can be understood from a thermodynamic perspective, where the final 'bald' state represents a configuration of maximum entropy for the given conserved quantities.\n\nTo investigate this principle, consider a simplified model of a \"hairy\" system.
