According to the principle of equivalence, this force is equal to the observer's mass $m$ multiplied by their proper acceleration, $a$. The proper acceleration is the magnitude of the 4-acceleration vector, which is a Lorentz invariant quantity. We must calculate this proper acceleration.\n\nFirst, we start with the Schwarzschild metric, which describes the spacetime geometry outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass $M$:\n$$ds^2 = -c^2 d\\tau^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\\right)c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2)$$\nThe term $\\frac{2GM}{c^2}$ is the Schwarzschild radius, $r_s$. So the metric is:\n$$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2)$$\nThe observer is stationary, which means their spatial coordinates are constant: $r = \\text{const}$, $\\theta = \\text{const}$, $\\phi = \\text{const}$. This implies $dr=d\\theta=d\\phi=0$.\n\nThe 4-velocity of the observer is $u^\\mu = \\frac{dx^\\mu}{d\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the proper time. For a stationary observer, the only non-zero component is $u^t = \\frac{dt}{d\\tau}$. The 4-velocity vector must satisfy the normalization condition $g_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu = -c^2$.\n$$g_{tt}(u^t)^2 = -c^2$$\n$$-\\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)c^2 (u^t)^2 = -c^2$$\n$$(u^t)^2 = \\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)^{-1}$$\n$$u^t = \\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)^{-1/2}$$\nSo the 4-velocity vector is $u^\\mu = \\left( (1-r_s/r)^{-1/2}, 0, 0, 0 \\right)$. Note that this $u^t$ is dimensionless. If we use coordinates $x^0=ct, x^1=r, \\dots$, the 4-velocity $U^\\mu = dx^\\mu/d\\tau$ has components $U^0 = c(1-r_s/r)^{-1/2}$ and spatial components zero.\n\nTo remain stationary, the observer must accelerate; their worldline is not a geodesic. The 4-acceleration is given by $a^\\mu = u^\\nu \\nabla_\\nu u^\\mu$. This can be written in terms of Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\mu_{\\alpha\\beta}$ as:\n$$a^\\mu = \\frac{du^\\mu}{d\\tau} + \\Gamma^\\mu_{\\alpha\\beta}u^\\alpha u^\\beta$$\nSince the components of the 4-velocity $u^\\mu$ are constant for a stationary observer, the term $\\frac{du^\\mu}{d\\tau}$ is zero. The only non-zero component of $u^\\mu$ is $u^t$. So the expression for the 4-acceleration simplifies to:\n$$a^\\mu = \\Gamma^\\mu_{tt}(u^t)^2$$\nWe need to find the components of the 4-acceleration. Due to the spherical symmetry, the only non-zero component will be in the radial direction, $a^r$. We need to calculate the Christoffel symbol $\\Gamma^r_{tt}$.\n$$\\Gamma^r_{tt} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{r\\lambda}(\\partial_t g_{\\lambda t} + \\partial_t g_{\\lambda t} - \\partial_\\lambda g_{tt})$$\nThe metric is static (time-independent) and diagonal, so this simplifies to:\n$$\\Gamma^r_{tt} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{rr}\\partial_r g_{tt}$$\nFrom the metric, we have $g_{tt} = -(1-r_s/r)c^2$ and $g_{rr}=(1-r_s/r)^{-1}$. The inverse metric component is $g^{rr} = 1/g_{rr} = (1-r_s/r)$.\nThe derivative of $g_{tt}$ with respect to $r$ is:\n$$\\partial_r g_{tt} = \\partial_r \\left( -c^2 + \\frac{c^2 r_s}{r} \\right) = -\\frac{c^2 r_s}{r^2}$$\nPlugging these into the expression for $\\Gamma^r_{tt}$:\n$$\\Gamma^r_{tt} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{c^2 r_s}{r^2}\\right) = \\frac{c^2 r_s}{2r^2}\\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)$$\nNow we can find the radial component of the 4-acceleration, $a^r$:\n$$a^r = \\Gamma^r_{tt}(u^t)^2 = \\left(\\frac{c^2 r_s}{2r^2}\\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)\\right) \\left(\\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)^{-1}\\right) = \\frac{c^2 r_s}{2r^2}$$\nSubstituting $r_s = 2GM/c^2$:\n$$a^r = \\frac{c^2}{2r^2}\\left(\\frac{2GM}{c^2}\\right) = \\frac{GM}{r^2}$$\nThis is the coordinate acceleration. The force is related to the proper acceleration, $a$, which is the magnitude of the 4-acceleration vector: $a = \\sqrt{a_\\mu a^\\mu} = \\sqrt{g_{\\mu\\nu}a^\\mu a^\\nu}$.\nSince $a^r$ is the only non-zero component, this is:\n$$a = \\sqrt{g_{rr}(a^r)^2} = a^r \\sqrt{g_{rr}} = \\frac{GM}{r^2} \\sqrt{\\left(1-\\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)^{-1}} = \\frac{GM}{r^2\\sqrt{1-r_s/r}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the proper acceleration required to hover at radius $r$. The problem specifies the location $r=2r_s$. At this radius, the acceleration is:\n$$a = \\frac{GM}{(2r_s)^2\\sqrt{1-r_s/(2r_s)}} = \\frac{GM}{4r_s^2\\sqrt{1/2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}GM}{4r_s^2}$$\nNow, we can substitute $r_s = 2GM/c^2$ into this expression to get a formula independent of $r_s$:\n$$a = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}GM}{4(2GM/c^2)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}GM}{4(4G^2M^2/c^4)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}GM c^4}{16G^2M^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}c^4}{16GM}$$\nThe force required is $F = ma$:\n$$F = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} m c^4}{16 G M}$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $m = 70.0$ kg, $M = M_{\\odot} = 1.989 \\times 10^{30}$ kg, $c=2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s, $G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11}$ m$^3$kg$^{-1}$s$^{-2}$.\n$$F = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\times 70.0 \\times (2.998 \\times 10^8)^4}{16 \\times (6.674 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (1.989 \\times 10^{30})}$$\n$$F = \\frac{(1.41421) \\times 70.0 \\times (8.0784 \\times 10^{33})}{16 \\times (1.3276 \\times 10^{20})}$$\n$$F = \\frac{7.9975 \\times 10^{35}}{2.1242 \\times 10^{21}} \\approx 3.765 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{N}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $3.77 \\times 10^{14}$ N.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.77 \\times 10^{14}}$$", "id": "1875315"}]}
