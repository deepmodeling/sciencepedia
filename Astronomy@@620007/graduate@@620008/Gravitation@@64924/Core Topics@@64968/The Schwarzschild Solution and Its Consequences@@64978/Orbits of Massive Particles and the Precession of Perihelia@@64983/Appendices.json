In Newtonian gravity, the period of a full azimuthal orbit (a revolution of $2\\pi$ radians) is identical to the period of a full radial oscillation (from one periapsis to the next). However, in General Relativity, these two periods diverge. This divergence leads to observable phenomena such as the precession of the perihelion of Mercury's orbit.\n\nLet $T_{orb}$ denote the orbital period (the time to complete one $2\\pi$ azimuthal revolution) and $T_{rad}$ denote the radial or \"epicyclic\" period (the time for one complete radial oscillation about the mean radius).
