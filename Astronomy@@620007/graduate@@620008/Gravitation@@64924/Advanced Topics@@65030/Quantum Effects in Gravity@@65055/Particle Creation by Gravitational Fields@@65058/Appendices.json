Through this practice, you will see how the principles of horizon thermodynamics are universal, connecting the physics of gravitation with the dynamics of condensed matter.", "problem": "**Background**\n\nIn the field of analogue gravity, certain properties of curved spacetime can be mimicked by fluid flows. For an irrotational, inviscid, barotropic fluid, the propagation of sound waves (phonons) can be described by an effective spacetime metric, known as the acoustic metric. A sonic horizon, analogous to a black hole's event horizon, can form where the fluid's velocity exceeds the local speed of sound.\n\nThe effective Hawking temperature $T_H$ of such a sonic horizon is related to its surface gravity $\\kappa$ by the formula $T_H = \\frac{\\hbar\\kappa}{2\\pi k_B}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. For a stationary flow forming a sonic horizon at a constant radius $r=r_H$, the surface gravity can be calculated as the magnitude of the gradient of the normal component of the fluid velocity, evaluated at the horizon:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\left| \\frac{d v_n}{dr} \\right|_{r=r_H}\n$$\nwhere $v_n$ is the component of the fluid velocity normal to the horizon surface, which is assumed to be a surface of constant radius.\n\n**Problem**\n\nConsider an incompressible, irrotational fluid flow in a (2+1)-dimensional plane. The flow is described in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ by the velocity potential:\n$$\n\\phi(r, \\theta) = A \\ln r - B \\theta\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are real constants characterizing the strength of the radial and azimuthal flow, respectively. The fluid has a constant speed of sound, $c_s$.\n\nA sonic black hole analogue requires an inward flow, so we assume $A < 0$.

Express your answer symbolically in terms of the given parameters $A$, $c_s$, and the physical constants $\\hbar$ and $k_B$.", "solution": "**1. Determine the fluid velocity field**\n\nThe fluid velocity field $\\mathbf{v}$ is given by the gradient of the velocity potential $\\phi$. In polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, the gradient operator is $\\nabla = \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$.\n\nApplying this to the given potential $\\phi(r, \\theta) = A \\ln r - B \\theta$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}(r, \\theta) = \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(A \\ln r - B \\theta) + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(A \\ln r - B \\theta)\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r} = \\frac{A}{r}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\theta} = -B\n$$\nSo, the velocity field is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}(r, \\theta) = \\frac{A}{r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} - \\frac{B}{r} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\n$$\nThis velocity field describes a combination of a radial flow (a sink since $A<0$) and a vortex flow.

The radial velocity component $v_r = A/r$ is normal to a surface of constant radius, so $v_n = v_r$.\nThe condition for the horizon is:\n$$\nv_r(r_H) = -c_s\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates inward flow.
