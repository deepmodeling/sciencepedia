This exercise offers a startling perspective on how quantum gravity might resolve one of physics' greatest puzzles.", "problem": "**Title: Probability Distribution for a Quadratic Wormhole Coupling**\n\n**Background**\n\nIn Euclidean quantum gravity, a proposed mechanism by S. Coleman aims to explain the observed small value of the cosmological constant. The theory postulates that spacetime wormholes connect distant regions of spacetime or even different \"universes\". When integrating out these wormhole configurations in the path integral, they induce an infinite number of effective local operators in the low-energy effective action. The coupling constants of these operators, denoted by $\\{\\alpha_i\\}$, are not fixed but are dynamical variables to be integrated over.\n\nColeman's central conjecture is that the probability distribution for finding a universe with a specific set of couplings $\\{\\alpha_i\\}$ is given by:\n$$ P(\\{\\alpha_i\\}) \\propto \\exp(Z[\\{\\alpha_i\\}]) $$\nwhere $Z[\\{\\alpha_i\\}]$ is the partition function of a single universe with those couplings. In the semi-classical (saddle-point) approximation, the partition function is dominated by the contribution from the classical solution with the least amount of Euclidean action, $S_E^*$:\n$$ Z[\\{\\alpha_i\\}] \\approx \\exp(-S_E^*[\\{\\alpha_i\\}]) $$\nFor a positive effective cosmological constant, $\\Lambda_{eff}  0$, the classical solution to the Euclidean Einstein's equations is a 4-sphere ($S^4$). The on-shell action for this solution is given by:\n$$ S_E^* = -\\frac{3\\pi}{G \\Lambda_{eff}} $$\nwhere $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant. This leads to a probability distribution that is \"doubly\" an exponential of the action: $P \\propto \\exp(\\exp(-S_E^*))$.\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nConsider a toy model of Euclidean quantum gravity where the action consists of the standard Einstein-Hilbert term with a positive bare cosmological constant, $\\Lambda_b  0$, and an additional effective term induced by a species of wormholes. The total Euclidean action is:\n$$ S_E[\\alpha] = -\\frac{1}{16\\pi G} \\int d^4x \\sqrt{g} (R - 2\\Lambda_b) - c \\alpha^2 \\int d^4x \\sqrt{g} $$\nHere, $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $g$ is the determinant of the metric tensor, and the wormhole effect is described by the parameter $\\alpha$ and a positive constant $c  0$. The parameter $\\alpha$ is a real-valued variable that is integrated over in the full theory.\n\nYour task is to analyze the resulting probability distribution for the quantity $x = \\alpha^2$. Find the value $x_0$ at which the probability distribution $P(x)$ is infinitely peaked. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $\\Lambda_b$, $G$, and $c$.", "solution": "**1.

Calculate the On-Shell Action**\n\nThe problem states that the on-shell action for a 4-sphere solution (which is valid for $\\Lambda_{eff}  0$) is given by:\n$$ S_E^* = -\\frac{3\\pi}{G \\Lambda_{eff}} $$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\Lambda_{eff}(x)$:\n$$ S_E^*(x) = -\\frac{3\\pi}{G(\\Lambda_b - 8\\pi G c x)} $$\n\n**3. Determine the Probability Distribution**\n\nAccording to Coleman's postulate, the probability distribution for the parameter $\\alpha$ is:\n$$ P(\\alpha) \\propto \\exp(Z[\\alpha]) $$\nUsing the semi-classical approximation $Z[\\alpha] \\approx \\exp(-S_E^*[\\alpha])$, we have:\n$$ P(\\alpha) \\propto \\exp(\\exp(-S_E^*(\\alpha^2))) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $S_E^*(\\alpha^2)$:\n$$ P(\\alpha) \\propto \\exp\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{G(\\Lambda_b - 8\\pi G c \\alpha^2)}\\right)\\right] $$\nThis distribution is an even function of $\\alpha$, i.e., $P(\\alpha) = P(-\\alpha)$, as it depends only on $\\alpha^2$.\n\nNow, we must find the probability distribution $P(x)$ for the variable $x = \\alpha^2$. We use the change of variables formula for probability distributions. For $x  0$, the value arises from two values of $\\alpha$, namely $\\pm\\sqrt{x}$. Thus:\n$$ P(x) |dx| = P(\\alpha) |d\\alpha| + P(-\\alpha) |-d\\alpha| = 2 P(\\alpha) |d\\alpha| \\quad (\\text{for } \\alpha  0) $$\nFrom $x = \\alpha^2$, we have $dx = 2\\alpha d\\alpha$, which gives the Jacobian factor $\\frac{d\\alpha}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}$.\nTherefore, the probability distribution for $x$ is:\n$$ P(x) = P(\\alpha=\\sqrt{x}) \\cdot \\left| \\frac{d\\alpha}{dx} \\right| \\cdot 2 = P(\\sqrt{x}) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} $$\n$$ P(x) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} \\exp\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{G(\\Lambda_b - 8\\pi G c x)}\\right)\\right] $$\n\n**4. Find the Location of the Infinite Peak**\n\nThe distribution $P(x)$ is infinitely peaked where its value diverges. The divergence is driven by the double exponential term. The expression $\\exp(\\exp(A))$ diverges when its argument $A$ diverges to positive infinity. In our case, the argument is:\n$$ A(x) = \\frac{3\\pi}{G(\\Lambda_b - 8\\pi G c x)} $$\nFor this argument $A(x)$ to diverge to $+\\infty$, its denominator must approach zero from the positive side. The constants $G$ and $\\pi$ are positive.\n$$ G(\\Lambda_b - 8\\pi G c x) \\to 0^+ $$\n$$ \\Lambda_b - 8\\pi G c x \\to 0^+ $$\nThis condition defines the value $x_0$ at which the distribution is peaked. We solve for $x$:\n$$ \\Lambda_b = 8\\pi G c x_0 $$\n$$ x_0 = \\frac{\\Lambda_b}{8\\pi G c} $$\nSince $\\Lambda_b  0$, $G  0$, and $c  0$, this value $x_0$ is positive, which is consistent with $x = \\alpha^2$. The peak occurs as $x$ approaches this value from below ($x \\to x_0^-$), which corresponds to $\\Lambda_{eff} \\to 0^+$, the range where the $S^4$ instanton solution is valid. The factor of $1/\\sqrt{x}$ in $P(x)$ is finite at $x_0$ and does not affect the location of the infinite peak.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{\\Lambda_b}{8\\pi G c}} $$", "id": "913589"}]}
