Jacobian Matrix Derivation**\n\nTo implement Newton's method, we must compute the Jacobian matrix of the RHS vector $\\mathbf{F}$ with respect to the state vector $\\mathbf{y} = [X_{\\mathrm{D}}, X_{\\mathrm{He}}]^T$. The Jacobian $J$ is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with elements $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial F_i}{\\partial y_j}$, where $y_1=X_D$ and $y_2=X_{He}$.\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\nJ_{11} = \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{D}}} \\left( k_{1f}X_{\\mathrm{p}}^2 - k_{1r}X_{\\mathrm{D}} - 2k_{2f}X_{\\mathrm{D}}^2 + 2k_{2r}X_{\\mathrm{He}} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{p}}}{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{D}}} = -2$.\n$$\nJ_{11} = k_{1f}(2X_{\\mathrm{p}})\\frac{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{p}}}{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{D}}} - k_{1r} - 4k_{2f}X_{\\mathrm{D}} = -4k_{1f}X_{\\mathrm{p}} - k_{1r} - 4k_{2f}X_{\\mathrm{D}}\n$$\n$$\nJ_{12} = \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{He}}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{He}}} \\left( k_{1f}X_{\\mathrm{p}}^2 - k_{1r}X_{\\mathrm{D}} - 2k_{2f}X_{\\mathrm{D}}^2 + 2k_{2r}X_{\\mathrm{He}} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{p}}}{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{He}}} = -4$.\n$$\nJ_{12} = k_{1f}(2X_{\\mathrm{p}})\\frac{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{p}}}{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{He}}} + 2k_{2r} = -8k_{1f}X_{\\mathrm{p}} + 2k_{2r}\n$$\n$$\nJ_{21} = \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{D}}} \\left( k_{2f}X_{\\mathrm{D}}^2 - k_{2r}X_{\\mathrm{He}} \\right) = 2k_{2f}X_{\\mathrm{D}}\n$$\n$$\nJ_{22} = \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{He}}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_{\\mathrm{He}}} \\left( k_{2f}X_{\\mathrm{D}}^2 - k_{2r}X_{\\mathrm{He}} \\right) = -k_{2r}\n$$\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ(t, \\mathbf{y}) = \\begin{pmatrix} -4k_{1f}X_{\\mathrm{p}} - k_{1r} - 4k_{2f}X_{\\mathrm{D}} & -8k_{1f}X_{\\mathrm{p}} + 2k_{2r} \\\\ 2k_{2f}X_{\\mathrm{D}} & -k_{2r} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rate coefficients $k(T)$ are evaluated at the time $t$ of interest.\n\n**3. Numerical Integration: Implicit Euler with Newton's Method**\n\nExplicit methods like forward Euler would require prohibitively small time steps for this stiff system to remain stable. We employ the A-stable backward (implicit) Euler method. For a time step $\\Delta t$, the state at $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$ is approximated by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{y}_n + \\Delta t \\, \\mathbf{F}(t_{n+1}, \\mathbf{y}_{n+1})\n$$\nThis is a nonlinear algebraic equation for the unknown $\\mathbf{y}_{n+1}$. We solve it using Newton's method by finding the root of the residual function $\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{z}) = \\mathbf{0}$, where $\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{y}_{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{z}) = \\mathbf{z} - \\mathbf{y}_n - \\Delta t \\, \\mathbf{F}(t_{n+1}, \\mathbf{z}) = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nStarting with an initial guess $\\mathbf{z}_0 = \\mathbf{y}_n$, Newton's method generates a sequence of approximations $\\mathbf{z}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{z}_k + \\Delta \\mathbf{z}_k$. The update step $\\Delta \\mathbf{z}_k$ is found by solving the linear system:\n$$\nJ_G(\\mathbf{z}_k) \\Delta \\mathbf{z}_k = - \\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{z}_k)\n$$\nThe Jacobian of the residual function, $J_G$, is:\n$$\nJ_G(\\mathbf{z}) = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{G}}{\\partial \\mathbf{z}} = I - \\Delta t \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}(t_{n+1}, \\mathbf{z})}{\\partial \\mathbf{z}} = I - \\Delta t \\, J(t_{n+1}, \\mathbf{z})\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix and $J$ is the Jacobian of the ODE system derived previously. The iteration proceeds until the norm of the residual $\\|\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{z}_k)\\|$ falls below a tolerance of $10^{-12}$.\n\n**4. Feasibility Constraints and Line Search**\n\nThe species abundances must remain physically meaningful, which implies non-negativity: $X_{\\mathrm{D}} \\ge 0$, $X_{\\mathrm{He}} \\ge 0$, and $X_{\\mathrm{p}} \\ge 0$. The last constraint translates to $1 - 2X_{\\mathrm{D}} - 4X_{\\mathrm{He}} \\ge 0$. A full Newton step $\\Delta \\mathbf{z}_k$ might produce a candidate state $\\mathbf{z}_k + \\Delta \\mathbf{z}_k$ that violates these constraints. To prevent this, a backtracking line search is implemented.\nAfter computing $\\Delta \\mathbf{z}_k$, we find the largest step length $\\lambda \\in \\{1, 1/2, 1/4, \\ldots\\}$ such that the updated state $\\mathbf{z}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{z}_k + \\lambda \\Delta \\mathbf{z}_k$ is feasible. We start with $\\lambda=1$ and successively halve it until all three non-negativity conditions are met. This ensures that the solver never enters an unphysical region of the state space.\n\nThe overall algorithm integrates from $t=0$ to $t_f$ with a fixed step $\\Delta t = 10^{-2}$. At each time step, the Newton-Raphson solver with the backtracking line search is invoked to find the state at the next time point. The final value of $X_{\\mathrm{He}}(t_f)$ is reported for each test case.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the primordial nucleosynthesis problem for the given test suite.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test suite: (T0, tau, tf)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 200.0, 500.0),  # Case A\n        (1.0, 50.0, 500.0),   # Case B\n        (0.8, 200.0, 500.0),  # Case C\n        (1.0, 200.0, 50.0),   # Case D\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for params in test_cases:\n        T0, tau, tf = params\n        final_X_He = run_integration(T0, tau, tf)\n        results.append(final_X_He)\n\n    formatted_results = [f\"{r:.6f}\" for r in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\ndef run_integration(T0, tau, tf):\n    \"\"\"\n    Integrates the stiff ODE system for a single test case.\n\n    Args:\n        T0 (float): Initial temperature in MeV.\n        tau (float): Cooling timescale in seconds.\n        tf (float): Final integration time in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The final mass fraction of Helium-4, X_He(tf).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical and numerical parameters\n    a1, a1r = 10.0, 3.0\n    a2, a2r = 5.0, 1.0\n    Q1, Q2 = 0.2, 0.1  # in MeV\n\n    # Timestepping parameters\n    dt = 1.0e-2\n    newton_tol = 1.0e-12\n    newton_max_iter = 20\n\n    # Initial conditions\n    y = np.array([0.0, 0.0])  # y = [X_D, X_He]\n    t = 0.0\n\n    num_steps = round(tf / dt)\n\n    # Time integration loop\n    for n in range(num_steps):\n        t_next = (n + 1) * dt\n        y_current = y\n\n        # --- Newton-Raphson solver for implicit Euler step ---\n        z = np.copy(y_current)  # Guess for y_next\n\n        for k in range(newton_max_iter):\n            # Evaluate temperature and rate coefficients at t_next\n            T = T0 / np.sqrt(1.0 + t_next / tau)\n            sqrt_T = np.sqrt(T)\n\n            # Avoid division by zero if T approaches 0, though unlikely with given params\n            if T < 1.0e-9: T = 1.0e-9\n\n            k1f = a1 * sqrt_T * np.exp(-Q1 / T)\n            k1r = a1r * T**3\n            k2f = a2 * sqrt_T * np.exp(-Q2 / T)\n            k2r = a2r * T**3\n            \n            # Unpack current Newton iterate z = [X_D, X_He]\n            XD, XHe = z[0], z[1]\n            Xp = 1.0 - 2.0 * XD - 4.0 * XHe\n\n            # Ensure proton fraction is non-negative for rate calculations\n            if Xp < 0: Xp = 0.0\n\n            # Reaction rates\n            R1f = k1f * Xp**2\n            R1r = k1r * XD\n            R2f = k2f * XD**2\n            R2r = k2r * XHe\n\n            # ODE right-hand side vector F(t_next, z)\n            F = np.array([\n                R1f - R1r - 2.0 * R2f + 2.0 * R2r,\n                R2f - R2r\n            ])\n\n            # Newton residual vector G(z)\n            G = z - y_current - dt * F\n\n            # Check for convergence\n            if np.linalg.norm(G) < newton_tol:\n                break\n            \n            # Jacobian of F\n            J11 = -4.0 * k1f * Xp - k1r - 4.0 * k2f * XD\n            J12 = -8.0 * k1f * Xp + 2.0 * k2r\n            J21 = 2.0 * k2f * XD\n            J22 = -k2r\n            J = np.array([[J11, J12], [J21, J22]])\n\n            # Solve the linear system for the Newton step: (I - dt*J) * dz = -G\n            A = np.identity(2) - dt * J\n            dz = np.linalg.solve(A, -G)\n\n            # --- Backtracking line search to ensure feasibility ---\n            lam = 1.0\n            for _ in range(10):  # Max 10 halvings\n                z_new = z + lam * dz\n                XD_new, XHe_new = z_new[0], z_new[1]\n                Xp_new = 1.0 - 2.0 * XD_new - 4.0 * XHe_new\n\n                if XD_new >= 0 and XHe_new >= 0 and Xp_new >= 0:\n                    break  # Feasible step found\n                lam /= 2.0\n            \n            z = z + lam * dz\n\n        y = z  # Update state vector\n        \n    return y[1]  # Return final X_He\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2442938"}]}
