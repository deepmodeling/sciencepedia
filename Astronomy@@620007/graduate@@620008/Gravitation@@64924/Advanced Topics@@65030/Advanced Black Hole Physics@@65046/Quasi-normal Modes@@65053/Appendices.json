A remarkable feature of black holes is that their properties are determined solely by their mass, charge, and spin. This exercise [@problem_id:1943331] invites you to use the powerful tool of dimensional analysis to determine how the fundamental ringdown frequency of a simple Schwarzschild black hole must scale with its mass.

This process is known as \"ringdown\" and is analogous to the way a struck bell radiates sound. The emitted waveform during ringdown can be described as a superposition of damped sinusoids, known as Quasinormal Modes (QNMs).\n\nConsider a simple, non-spinning, electrically neutral (Schwarzschild) black hole of mass $M$. The fundamental angular frequency $\\omega$ of its ringdown is determined solely by the properties of the black hole itself and the fundamental constants of nature. Assume that this frequency $\\omega$ depends only on the black hole's mass $M$, the universal gravitational constant $G$, and the speed of light in a vacuum $c$.

A powerful analytical tool for this is the Schutz-Will approximation, which models the effective potential barrier outside a black hole as an inverted parabola. In this exercise [@problem_id:1143485], you will use this method to derive an explicit formula for the fundamental QNM frequency, connecting the abstract parameters of the potential's peak to the physical oscillation and damping rates. This technique beautifully illustrates how a clever physical approximation can turn a seemingly intractable problem into a solvable one.", "problem": "In the study of black hole perturbations, the stability and response of the spacetime to external disturbances are analyzed through quasinormal modes (QNMs). These modes are characterized by a discrete set of complex frequencies, $\\omega = \\omega_R + i\\omega_I$, which correspond to solutions of a wave equation that are purely ingoing at the black hole's event horizon and purely outgoing at spatial infinity. For a Schwarzschild black hole, perturbations are governed by the Regge-Wheeler equation, which takes the form of a one-dimensional, time-independent Schrödinger-like equation:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\Psi}{dr_*^2} + (\\omega^2 - V(r_*))\\Psi = 0 $$\nHere, $\\Psi$ represents the perturbation waveform, $r_*$ is the \"tortoise\" radial coordinate, and $V(r_*)$ is the effective potential, which acts as a barrier. The shape of this potential depends on the properties of the black hole (mass $M$) and the nature of the perturbation (e.g., its angular momentum number $l$).\n\nFinding the exact QNM frequencies $\\omega$ for the true Regge-Wheeler potential is a complex numerical task. However, a highly effective analytical approximation was developed by Schutz and Will (1985). The method involves approximating the potential barrier $V(r_*)$ near its peak with an inverted parabola:\n$$ V(r_*) \\approx V_0 - \\frac{1}{2}\\Omega^2(r_*-r_{*,0})^2 $$\nwhere $V_0$ is the maximum value of the potential, $r_{*,0}$ is its location, and $\\Omega^2$ is a parameter related to the negative of the second derivative of the potential at its peak (i.e., $\\Omega^2 = -V''(r_{*,0})$), which measures the curvature of the barrier top.\n\nWith this approximation, the problem of finding QNM frequencies reduces to solving the wave equation for the inverted parabolic potential. The QNM frequencies are found by imposing the appropriate boundary conditions. This leads to a quantization condition for the allowed complex frequencies. For the inverted parabolic barrier, this condition is given by:\n$$ \\omega^2 - V_0 = -i \\Omega \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right), \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\nwhere $n$ is the overtone number.
