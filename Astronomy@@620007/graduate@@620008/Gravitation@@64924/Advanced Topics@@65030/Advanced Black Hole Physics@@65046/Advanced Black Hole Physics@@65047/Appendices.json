Consider the spherically symmetric collapse of a massless scalar field governed by the Einstein field equations. The initial data for the scalar field is specified by a one-parameter family, characterized by an amplitude-like parameter $p$. There exists a critical value $p^*$ such that for $p > p^*$ the collapse leads to a black hole, while for $p < p^*$ the field disperses to infinity.\n\nFor near-critical initial data, i.e., where $p$ is infinitesimally close to $p^*$, the mass of the formed black hole, $M_{\\text{BH}}$, is found to obey a universal power-law scaling relation:\n$$M_{\\text{BH}} = C |p - p^*|^\\gamma$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant and $\\gamma$ is a universal mass-scaling exponent that is independent of the specific details of the initial data family, but dependent on the matter model.\n\nThe dynamics at the threshold of black hole formation ($p=p^*$) is described by a specific *critical solution*. This solution is discretely self-similar (DSS). A key feature of DSS is that the solution's profile repeats itself on ever-decreasing time and length scales. This can be captured by using a logarithmic time coordinate, $\\tau = -\\ln(-t)$, where $t$ is the proper time of a central observer approaching the central singularity at $t=0$. In this logarithmic time, the critical solution is periodic.\n\nThe fate of a near-critical solution ($p \\approx p^*$) is determined by its deviation from the critical solution. Linear perturbation analysis of the critical solution reveals the existence of a single unstable (growing) mode. The amplitude of this mode, let's denote it by $\\Lambda(\\tau)$, determines whether the solution ultimately forms a black hole or disperses.\n\nYou are given the following properties of this system:\n1.  The initial amplitude of the unstable mode at some initial time $\\tau_0$ is directly proportional to the deviation of the initial data parameter $p$ from its critical value $p^*$. That is, $\\Lambda(\\tau_0) \\propto (p - p^*)$.\n2.  Due to the periodicity of the underlying critical solution, the evolution of the growing mode amplitude is governed by Floquet theory. The functional form of the growth is given by $\\Lambda(\\tau) \\propto e^{\\lambda \\tau}$, where $\\lambda$ is the unique positive characteristic (Floquet) exponent of the unstable mode.\n3.  A black hole is formed at the moment the perturbation becomes non-linear. This occurs when its amplitude $\\Lambda(\\tau)$ grows to a fixed threshold of order unity. Let's denote the logarithmic time of collapse as $\\tau_{\\text{coll}}$.\n4.  In a scale-free theory like this one (with $G=c=1$), the mass of the resulting black hole is set by the only available physical scale at the time of collapse. This scale is the time remaining to the would-be central singularity, $t_{\\text{coll}}$. Thus, we have the relation $M_{\\text{BH}} \\propto -t_{\\text{coll}}$.\n\nYour task is to derive an expression for the mass-scaling exponent $\\gamma$ in terms of the characteristic exponent $\\lambda$.", "solution": "1.

Method of Matched Asymptotic Expansions**\n\nIn the low-frequency limit ($\\omega M \\ll 1$), we solve the radial equation by dividing the spacetime into two overlapping regions.\n\n**Region 1: The Near Region ($R_S \\lesssim r \\ll 1/\\omega$)**\nIn this region, the energy term $\\omega^2$ is much smaller than the potential barrier peak ($V_0 \\sim 1/R_S^2$).

The original radial equation before changing to $r_*$ is $\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 f(r) \\frac{dR}{dr}\\right) + \\frac{\\omega^2}{f(r)}R = 0$. Setting $\\omega=0$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 f(r) \\frac{dR}{dr}\\right) = 0 $$\nIntegrating once gives $r^2 f(r) \\frac{dR}{dr} = \\text{const}$.

Boundary Condition at the Horizon**\n\nAt the event horizon ($r \\to R_S$, which is $r_* \\to -\\infty$), the physical boundary condition is that waves must be purely ingoing. This means $\\psi_0(r_*) \\sim e^{-i\\omega r_*}$. To find the implication for our constants $C_1$ and $C_2$, we analyze the radial equation for $R(r)$ close to the horizon. Let $r = R_S + \\epsilon$. The radial equation $\\frac{d}{dr}(r(r-R_S)\\frac{dR}{dr}) + \\frac{\\omega^2 r^3}{r-R_S} R = 0$ becomes:\n$$ \\epsilon \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon}\\left(\\epsilon \\frac{dR}{d\\epsilon}\\right) + (\\omega R_S)^2 R \\approx 0 $$\nThis is an Euler equation with solutions $\\epsilon^{\\pm i\\omega R_S}$. The ingoing solution corresponds to a phase $e^{-i\\omega r_*}$, which maps to $(r-R_S)^{-i\\omega R_S}$.

Near the horizon, $\\ln r \\to \\ln R_S$:\n$$ R_{near}(r) \\approx C_1 \\ln(r-R_S) + (C_2 - C_1 \\ln R_S) $$\nMatching the two forms gives the relations (up to a proportionality constant we set to 1):\n$$ C_1 = -i\\omega R_S \\quad \\text{and} \\quad C_2 - C_1\\ln R_S = 1 \\implies C_2 = 1 - i\\omega R_S \\ln R_S $$\nTo leading order in $\\omega$, the ratio of the constants is:\n$$ \\frac{C_1}{C_2} \\approx -i\\omega R_S $$\n\n**4.
