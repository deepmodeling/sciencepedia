An initial message, represented by a single bit random variable $X$, is sent into the system. The source is unbiased, meaning $P(X=0) = P(X=1) = 1/2$.\n\nThe system's internal state, represented by a random variable $Y$, becomes a scrambled version of the input $X$. This scrambling process is modeled as a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC), where the bit is flipped with a probability $p$.

This means the total quantum state of the combined system, which includes the black hole and its emitted Hawking radiation, remains a pure state at all times.\n\nConsider a large, isolated, non-rotating, and uncharged (Schwarzschild) black hole of initial mass $M_0$.

By modeling Hawking radiation as the loss of some physical qubits, you will discover the remarkable feature of these codes: the original information can be perfectly recovered. This exercise provides a concrete demonstration of how quantum information can be protected from local erasures, offering a compelling analogy for how information might escape an evaporating black hole.", "problem": "The Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence suggests a deep connection between quantum gravity in a bulk spacetime and a quantum field theory on its boundary. A simplified toy model for this duality, particularly for understanding the black hole information paradox, is provided by quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs). In this model, the Hilbert space of a logical qubit in the bulk is encoded into a subspace of the Hilbert space of several physical qubits on the boundary. The process of Hawking radiation can be modeled as losing access to a subset of these physical boundary qubits.\n\nConsider the $[[5,1,3]]$ perfect quantum code, which encodes one logical qubit into five physical qubits. The code space is defined as the simultaneous $+1$ eigenspace of the four commuting stabilizer generators:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_1 &= X \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\otimes X \\otimes I \\\\\nS_2 &= I \\otimes X \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\otimes X \\\\\nS_3 &= X \\otimes I \\otimes X \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\\\\nS_4 &= Z \\otimes X \\otimes I \\otimes X \\otimes Z\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $X, Y, Z$ are the Pauli matrices and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nSuppose an arbitrary logical pure state $|\\psi\\rangle_L = \\alpha|0\\rangle_L + \\beta|1\\rangle_L$ is prepared. Then, two of the five physical qubits are chosen uniformly at random and traced out, representing the information lost to Hawking radiation. An observer has access to the remaining three physical qubits and attempts to reconstruct the original logical state $|\\psi\\rangle_L$ by applying an optimal recovery procedure.\n\nCalculate the average fidelity between the initial and recovered logical states. The average is to be taken over all possible pure logical states $|\\psi\\rangle_L$ (i.e., over the entire Bloch sphere) and over all possible choices of the two traced-out qubits.", "solution": "Let the initial state of the logical qubit be a pure state $|\\psi\\rangle_L$, which lives in the two-dimensional code subspace $\\mathcal{C}$ of the full five-qubit Hilbert space $(\\mathbb{C}^2)^{\\otimes 5}$. The initial density matrix is $\\rho_L = |\\psi\\rangle_L \\langle\\psi|_L$.\n\nThe process involves randomly selecting a set $A$ of two physical qubits out of five and tracing them out. There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ such sets. Let $\\bar{A}$ be the set of the remaining three qubits. The state of the remaining system is $\\rho_{\\bar{A}} = \\text{Tr}_A(\\rho_L)$.\n\nAn optimal recovery procedure is a quantum channel $R: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_{\\bar{A}}) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_L)$ that maximizes the fidelity between the recovered state $\\rho_{rec} = R(\\rho_{\\bar{A}})$ and the original state $\\rho_L$. The fidelity is given by $F = \\langle\\psi|_L \\rho_{rec} |\\psi\\rangle_L$. We are interested in the average fidelity $\\bar{F}$, averaged over all initial pure states $|\\psi\\rangle_L$ and all 10 choices of the set $A$.\n\nThe possibility of perfect recovery ($F=1$ for all $|\\psi\\rangle_L$) depends on whether the information loss channel, $\\mathcal{N}_A(\\rho_L) = \\text{Tr}_A(\\rho_L)$, is reversible on the code space $\\mathcal{C}$. A quantum channel corresponding to the erasure of qubits in a set $A$ is correctable if and only if for any operator $O_A$ with support solely on the qubits in $A$, its projection onto the code space is proportional to the identity projector $P_{\\mathcal{C}}$. That is, for any $O_A$,\n$$P_{\\mathcal{C}} O_A P_{\\mathcal{C}} = c(O_A) P_{\\mathcal{C}}$$\nfor some constant $c(O_A)$. If this condition holds, perfect recovery is possible, and the fidelity is 1.\n\nWe need to check this condition for the $[[5,1,3]]$ code where the erased set $A$ consists of two qubits. Let's analyze the condition for an arbitrary Pauli operator $O_A$ supported on $A$. If $O_A$ anticommutes with any stabilizer generator $S_k$, i.e., $\\{O_A, S_k\\} = 0$, then for any state $|\\phi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{C}$, we have $S_k|\\phi\\rangle = |\\phi\\rangle$. Then,\n$$S_k (O_A |\\phi\\rangle) = -O_A S_k |\\phi\\rangle = -O_A |\\phi\\rangle$$\nThis means $O_A|\\phi\\rangle$ is in the $-1$ eigenspace of $S_k$ and is therefore orthogonal to the code space $\\mathcal{C}$. Thus, for any $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{C}$, $\\langle\\psi| O_A |\\phi\\rangle = 0$. This implies $P_{\\mathcal{C}} O_A P_{\\mathcal{C}} = 0$. The condition is satisfied with $c(O_A)=0$.\n\nIf $O_A$ commutes with all stabilizer generators, it belongs to the normalizer of the stabilizer group, $\\mathcal{N(S)}$. The normalizer consists of the stabilizers $\\mathcal{S}$ themselves and the logical operators.\n$$O_A \\in \\mathcal{N(S)} = \\mathcal{S} \\cup \\{ \\text{logical operators} \\}$$\n- If $O_A \\in \\mathcal{S}$, then $O_A|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ for all $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{C}$. So $P_{\\mathcal{C}} O_A P_{\\mathcal{C}} = P_{\\mathcal{C}}$ and the condition holds with $c(O_A)=1$.\n- If $O_A$ is a logical operator, it does not act as a multiple of the identity on the code space, and the condition $P_{\\mathcal{C}} O_A P_{\\mathcal{C}} = cP_{\\mathcal{C}}$ is violated. This would make the erasure uncorrectable.\n\nSo, perfect recovery is possible if and only if no operator supported on the erased set $A$ is a logical operator, and any operator on $A$ that is not a stabilizer must anticommute with at least one stabilizer.\n\nLet's examine the properties of the $[[5,1,3]]$ code.\n1.  **Logical operators:** The distance of the code is $d=3$. This means the minimum weight (number of non-identity Pauli matrices) of a logical operator is 3. An operator $O_A$ supported on two qubits has a weight of at most 2. Therefore, $O_A$ cannot be a logical operator.\n\n2.  **Stabilizer operators:** The specified generators $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ all have weight 4. By symmetry of the stabilizer generators under relabeling and Pauli transformations, one can show that any non-trivial element of the stabilizer group $\\mathcal{S}$ for this code has weight at least 3. In fact, all 15 non-trivial stabilizers have weight 4. An operator $O_A$ with support on two qubits (weight $\\le 2$) cannot be a stabilizer.\n\nCombining these points: any Pauli operator $O_A$ with support on a set $A$ of two qubits is neither a logical operator nor a stabilizer. Therefore, it cannot be in the normalizer of the stabilizer group. This implies that $O_A$ must anticommute with at least one stabilizer generator $S_k$.\n\nAs shown above, if $O_A$ anticommutes with some $S_k$, then $P_{\\mathcal{C}} O_A P_{\\mathcal{C}} = 0$. This holds for any Pauli operator supported on any set $A$ of two qubits. Since any operator $O_A$ can be written as a linear combination of Pauli operators, the condition holds for all operators on $A$.\n\nThis means that for any choice of two erased qubits, the erasure is correctable. An optimal recovery procedure can restore the original logical state $|\\psi\\rangle_L$ perfectly. Thus, for any set $A$ of two erased qubits, the fidelity is 1, regardless of the initial state.\n\nThe average fidelity is an average over the $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ choices for the pair of traced-out qubits. Since the fidelity is 1 for each choice, the average fidelity is also 1.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\nLet $F_A(\\psi)$ be the fidelity for a given choice of erased qubits $A$ and initial state $\\psi$.\nLet $\\bar{F}_A = \\int d\\psi F_A(\\psi)$ be the state-averaged fidelity for a fixed $A$.\nLet $\\bar{F}_{total}$ be the total average fidelity.\nWe have shown that for any $A$ with $|A|=2$, perfect recovery is possible, so $F_A(\\psi)=1$ for all $\\psi$.\nTherefore, $\\bar{F}_A = 1$ for all $A$.\nThe total average fidelity is:\n$$ \\bar{F}_{total} = \\frac{1}{\\binom{5}{2}} \\sum_{A:|A|=2} \\bar{F}_A = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{i=1}^{10} 1 = \\frac{10}{10} = 1 $$\nThe average fidelity of the logical state is 1.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "145163"}]}
