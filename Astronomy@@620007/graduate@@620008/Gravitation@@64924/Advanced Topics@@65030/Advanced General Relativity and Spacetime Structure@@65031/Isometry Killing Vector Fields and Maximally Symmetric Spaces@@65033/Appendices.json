Equivalently, the isotropy subgroup at $p$ must act transitively on the unit circle in $T_{p}$. The only continuous isometries come from the Killing fields $\\partial_{z}$ and $\\partial_{\\phi}$, but their flows move the point unless the parameter is zero; thus the connected component of the identity in the isotropy subgroup is trivial. More formally, any global Killing field on this product metric has the form $a\\,\\partial_{z}+b\\,\\partial_{\\phi}$ with constants $a,b$, and since $\\partial_{z}$ and $\\partial_{\\phi}$ are linearly independent everywhere, the only such field vanishing at $p$ is the zero field ($a=b=0$). Therefore there is no nontrivial one-parameter subgroup of isometries fixing $p$ that could generate continuous rotations of directions in $T_{p}$. Only discrete isometries that fix $p$ exist (e.g., reflections $(z,\\phi)\\mapsto(2z_{0}-z,\\phi)$ and $(z,\\phi)\\mapsto(z,2\\phi_{0}-\\phi)$), which do not act transitively on all tangent directions. Hence the surface is not isotropic.\n\nConclusion: the cylinder surface is homogeneous but not isotropic, so it is not maximally symmetric. This corresponds to option A.
