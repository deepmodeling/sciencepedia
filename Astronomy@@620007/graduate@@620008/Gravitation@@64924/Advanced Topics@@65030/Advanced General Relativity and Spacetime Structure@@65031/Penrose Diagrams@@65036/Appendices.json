The vertical direction on the diagram generally corresponds to a time-like coordinate, and the horizontal direction to a space-like coordinate.\n\nConsider the extended Penrose diagram for a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $M$.

Timelike worldlines must lie strictly inside this null cone, so locally they can have $dr>0$, $dr0$, or $dr=0$; in particular, a static worldline at fixed $r$ ($dr=0$) is timelike and physically realizable by an accelerated observer. Far from the black hole ($r_{A}\\gg 2M$), the metric approaches Minkowski form $ds^{2}\\approx -dt^{2}+dr^{2}+r^{2}d\\Omega^{2}$, so the light cones are nearly symmetric about the $t$-axis, matching the statement that timelike worldlines can remain at constant $r$ or move to larger or smaller $r$.\n\nInside the horizon ($r2M$), the metric coefficients swap causal character: $g_{tt}= -\\left(1-\\frac{2M}{r}\\right)>0$ and $g_{rr}=\\left(1-\\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}0$, so $r$ becomes a timelike coordinate and $t$ becomes spacelike.

Consequently, the entire future null cone lies within directions of decreasing $r$. Since timelike directions lie strictly inside the null cone, every future-directed timelike worldline inside the horizon must have decreasing $r$ and inevitably reaches $r=0$ in finite proper time.\n\nOn a Penrose diagram, conformal compactification preserves null directions as lines at $\\pm 45^{\\circ}$, so these local conclusions translate directly: far from the black hole (Point A), future timelike motion can maintain, increase, or decrease $r$; just inside the horizon (Point B), all future timelike motion is directed toward smaller $r$, with no possibility of remaining at constant $r$ or increasing $r$.\n\nTherefore, the statement that correctly captures the orientation and implications of the future light cones at Points A and B is that at A timelike worldlines can remain at constant $r$ or move to larger or smaller $r$, while at B the future cone is entirely oriented toward decreasing $r$, making approach to $r=0$ inevitable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1842007"}, {"introduction": "Having grasped how local causality is fundamentally altered within the event horizon, we can now use the Penrose diagram to trace complete journeys through the Schwarzschild spacetime.

The curvature singularities are at $r=0$, which corresponds to $UV=1$ (the future singularity bounding Region II) and $UV=1$ with the opposite time orientation for the past singularity bounding Region IV.\n\nBy construction, $(U,V)$ are global null coordinates. Radial null curves satisfy either $dU=0$ (outgoing) or $dV=0$ (ingoing). For future-directed motion, the null coordinates are monotone nondecreasing along causal curves:\n- A future-directed ingoing null ray has $dV=0$ and $U$ increases.\n- A future-directed outgoing null ray has $dU=0$ and $V$ increases.\n- Any future-directed timelike curve has both $U$ and $V$ increasing.\nThis monotonicity implies, in particular, that along any future-directed causal curve, $V$ cannot decrease and $U$ cannot decrease.\n\nWe now apply these causal properties to the question of sending a signal from Region I to Region III:\n- Region I has $V>0$, Region III has $V0$. To go from $V>0$ to $V0$ would require decreasing $V$ and crossing the null surface $V=0$, which is the past event horizon bounding the white hole (Region IV). Crossing $V=0$ from $V>0$ to $V0$ along a future-directed causal curve is impossible because $V$ is nondecreasing along any such curve. Therefore, no future-directed causal (timelike or null) curve starting in Region I can reach Region III.\n- Equivalently, no point of Region III lies in the causal future $J^{+}$ or causal past $J^{-}$ of any event in Region I; hence Region I and Region III are causally disconnected, and any pair of events with one in Region I and the other in Region III are spacelike related in the global causal sense (there exists no timelike or null curve connecting them in either direction).\n\nWhat then happens to a light signal or subluminal probe emitted from Region I toward the black hole? If it is directed inward so as to cross the future event horizon $U=0$ while $V>0$, it enters Region II and, by the same monotonicity ($U$ and $V$ both nondecreasing), it must reach the future singularity at $UV=1$ in finite affine/proper parameter; it cannot exit to Region III. If it is not directed inward strongly enough to cross the horizon, it simply remains in Region I and escapes to that asymptotic infinity, but still cannot reach Region III.\n\nThese causal facts allow us to evaluate the options:\n- A is false: proximity to the horizon in Region III does not help; no future-directed causal curve from Region I reaches Region III.\n- B captures the fate of any inward-directed attempt (the signal falls into Region II and hits the future singularity), but as a blanket statement it is too strong because a signal aimed outward does not inevitably fall in; nevertheless, either way it cannot reach Bob.\n- C is correct: communication is impossible, and the separation between any event in Region I and any event in Region III is causally spacelike (no timelike or null connection).\n- D is false: the Einstein–Rosen bridge is nontraversable in the future direction; there is no causal path from Region I to Region III that avoids Regions II or IV.\n- E is false: signals from Region I cannot emerge from the white hole (Region IV); the white hole emits into the past of both exteriors, not the future of Region I.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that no communication is possible because Region I and Region III are always spacelike separated in the causal sense.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1841988"}]}
