The gravitational field of this lens deflects light from a distant source, leading to the formation of multiple images for an observer.\n\nConsider a system with a source `S`, a point-mass lens `L`, and an observer `O`, all aligned such that they define a plane. The position of the source in the sky, in the absence of the lens, is given by the angular position vector $\\vec{\\beta}$. The observed angular position of an image is $\\vec{\\theta}$. Both $\\vec{\\beta}$ and $\\vec{\\theta}$ are two-dimensional vectors on the plane of the sky.\n\nThe relationship between the true source position and the image position is given by the gravitational lens equation:\n$$\n\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{\\theta} - \\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{\\theta})\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{\\theta})$ is the reduced deflection angle.

A point-mass lens always produces two distinct images of a single source, provided the source is not perfectly aligned with the lens. Let the angular positions of these two images be $\\vec{\\theta}_1$ and $\\vec{\\theta}_2$.\n\nThe signed magnification, $\\mu$, of an image is defined as the inverse of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the lens mapping, $A_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial\\beta_i}{\\partial\\theta_j}$:\n$$\n\\mu = (\\det(A))^{-1}\n$$\nThis quantity measures the ratio of the image's solid angle to the source's solid angle and can be positive (for a parity-preserving image) or negative (for a parity-reversed image).\n\nThere exists a remarkable \"magnification sum rule\" for the point-mass lens.

This problem asks you to derive the effect of the MSD on the inferred value of $H_0$.\n\n**Background:**\n\n1.  **Lensing Formalism:** The position of a lensed image on the sky, $\\vec{\\theta}$, is related to the true source position, $\\vec{\\beta}$, by the lens equation:\n    $$\n    \\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{\\theta} - \\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{\\theta}),\n    $$\n    where all positions are 2D vectors on the sky (in radians). The deflection angle, $\\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{\\theta})$, is the gradient of a scalar lensing potential, $\\psi(\\vec{\\theta})$: $\\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{\\theta}) = \\nabla_{\\vec{\\theta}} \\psi(\\vec{\\theta})$.

The physical time delay, $\\Delta t_{AB}$, between two images at positions $\\vec{\\theta}_A$ and $\\vec{\\theta}_B$ is proportional to the difference in their Fermat potentials:\n    $$\n    \\Delta t_{AB} = \\frac{D_{\\Delta t}}{c} [\\mathcal{T}(\\vec{\\theta}_A, \\vec{\\beta}) - \\mathcal{T}(\\vec{\\theta}_B, \\vec{\\beta})],\n    $$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light and $D_{\\Delta t}$ is the \"time-delay distance,\" which depends on the angular diameter distances between observer, lens, and source. For a given cosmology, $D_{\\Delta t}$ is inversely proportional to the Hubble constant, $H_0$.
