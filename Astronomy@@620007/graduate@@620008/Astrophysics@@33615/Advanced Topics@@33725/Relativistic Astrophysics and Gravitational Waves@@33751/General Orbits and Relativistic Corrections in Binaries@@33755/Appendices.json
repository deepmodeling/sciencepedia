The two stars orbit their common center of mass. Let their distances from the center of mass be $r_1$ and $r_2$, and their speeds be $v_1$ and $v_2$. We have $M_1 r_1 = M_2 r_2$ and $r_1 + r_2 = r_b$. From these, we find:\n$$r_1 = \\frac{M_2}{M_1 + M_2} r_b \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r_2 = \\frac{M_1}{M_1 + M_2} r_b$$\nFor star 1, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force.

The total mass-energy of the binary is the sum of the rest mass-energies of the components plus the total interaction energy $E_b$.\n$$M_{eff} c^2 = M_1 c^2 + M_2 c^2 + E_b$$\nThe effective mass $M_{eff}$ is therefore:\n$$M_{eff} = M_1 + M_2 + \\frac{E_b}{c^2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_b$:\n$$M_{eff} = M_1 + M_2 - \\frac{G M_1 M_2}{2 r_b c^2}$$\nThe term $-\\frac{G M_1 M_2}{2 r_b c^2}$ is the mass defect.
