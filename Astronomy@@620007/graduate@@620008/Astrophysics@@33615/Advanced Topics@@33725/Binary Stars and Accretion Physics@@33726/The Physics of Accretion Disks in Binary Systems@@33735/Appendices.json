This mass transfer occurs through the inner Lagrangian point, L1, forming a stream of gas.\n\nWe model this stream as a simplified, two-dimensional 'ribbon' of gas that flows away from the L1 point. The gas in the ribbon is a monatomic ideal gas with a mean molecular weight of $\\mu m_p$, where $\\mu$ is the mean molecular weight in atomic mass units and $m_p$ is the proton mass. As the stream moves away from L1, it travels with a constant velocity $v$ along its path.\n\nAt the L1 point, which we define as distance $d=0$, the gas stream has an initial temperature $T_0$ and an initial width $w_0$. The stream is thermally insulated from its surroundings, so its subsequent expansion is adiabatic. For a monatomic ideal gas in two dimensions, the adiabatic index is $\\gamma_{2D} = 2$.\n\nThe stream expands sideways because of its internal pressure. The velocity of expansion of each edge of the ribbon, relative to the centerline of the stream, is equal to the local sound speed, $c_s$. The sound speed in the 2D gas is given by $c_s = \\sqrt{\\gamma_{2D} k_B T / (\\mu m_p)}$, where $T$ is the local temperature and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

We will first establish the relationships between the physical quantities describing the stream and then solve the resulting differential equation.\n\n**1. Mass Conservation and Adiabatic Relation**\n\nThe mass flow rate, $\\dot{M}$, is constant along the stream. It can be expressed as the product of the surface density $\\Sigma$, the stream width $w$, and the stream velocity $v$:\n$$\n\\dot{M} = \\Sigma(d) w(d) v\n$$\nSince $v$ is constant, this implies that the product of surface density and width is constant:\n$$\n\\Sigma(d) w(d) = \\Sigma_0 w_0\n$$\nwhere $\\Sigma_0$ and $w_0$ are the surface density and width at $d=0$. This gives us a relation for the surface density:\n$$\n\\Sigma(d) = \\Sigma_0 \\frac{w_0}{w(d)}\n$$\n\nFor an adiabatic process involving an ideal gas, the relation between pressure $P$ and volume density $\\rho$ is $P \\propto \\rho^\\gamma$. In our 2D model, this translates to a relation between the 2D pressure $P_{2D}$ and the surface density $\\Sigma$: $P_{2D} \\propto \\Sigma^{\\gamma_{2D}}$.\nThe 2D ideal gas law relates pressure, density, and temperature: $P_{2D} = \\frac{\\Sigma k_B T}{\\mu m_p}$.\nCombining these two relations, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Sigma k_B T}{\\mu m_p} \\propto \\Sigma^{\\gamma_{2D}} \\implies T \\propto \\Sigma^{\\gamma_{2D}-1}\n$$\nThe problem states that the gas is monatomic in 2D, for which $\\gamma_{2D} = 2$. Thus, the temperature is directly proportional to the surface density:\n$$\nT \\propto \\Sigma^{2-1} \\implies T \\propto \\Sigma\n$$\nThis allows us to relate the temperature at any distance $d$ to the initial temperature $T_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{T(d)}{T_0} = \\frac{\\Sigma(d)}{\\Sigma_0}\n$$\nNow, we can combine this with the mass conservation result:\n$$\n\\frac{T(d)}{T_0} = \\frac{\\Sigma(d)}{\\Sigma_0} = \\frac{w_0}{w(d)} \\implies T(d) = T_0 \\frac{w_0}{w(d)}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the temperature of the stream decreases as its width increases.\n\n**2. Stream Expansion Dynamics**\n\nThe width of the stream $w$ increases because its edges expand outwards at the local sound speed $c_s$. The rate of change of the total width is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dt} = 2 c_s\n$$\nThe gas stream moves at a constant velocity $v$, so the distance from the L1 point is $d = vt$. We can relate the time derivative to a spatial derivative with respect to $d$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} = v \\frac{d}{dd}\n$$\nThus, the equation for the width's expansion becomes:\n$$\nv \\frac{dw}{dd} = 2 c_s \\implies \\frac{dw}{dd} = \\frac{2 c_s}{v}\n$$\nThe sound speed $c_s$ depends on the local temperature $T(d)$:\n$$\nc_s(d) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_{2D} k_B T(d)}{\\mu m_p}}\n$$\nWe can express the sound speed in terms of the width $w(d)$ using the relation $T(d) = T_0 w_0 / w(d)$:\n$$\nc_s(d) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_{2D} k_B T_0 w_0}{\\mu m_p w(d)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_{2D} k_B T_0}{\\mu m_p}} \\sqrt{\\frac{w_0}{w(d)}}\n$$\nLet's define the initial sound speed at $d=0$ as $c_{s0} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_{2D} k_B T_0}{\\mu m_p}}$. Then:\n$$\nc_s(d) = c_{s0} \\sqrt{\\frac{w_0}{w(d)}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the differential equation for $w$:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dd} = \\frac{2 c_{s0}}{v} \\sqrt{\\frac{w_0}{w}}\n$$\n\n**3. Solving the Differential Equation for the Width**\n\nWe have a first-order ordinary differential equation for $w(d)$. It is separable:\n$$\n\\sqrt{w} dw = \\frac{2 c_{s0} \\sqrt{w_0}}{v} dd\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from the L1 point ($d=0$) to a distance $d$. The width changes from $w_0$ to $w(d)$:\n$$\n\\int_{w_0}^{w(d)} w'^{1/2} dw' = \\int_{0}^{d} \\frac{2 c_{s0} \\sqrt{w_0}}{v} dd'\n$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{2}{3} w'^{3/2} \\right]_{w_0}^{w(d)} = \\frac{2 c_{s0} \\sqrt{w_0}}{v} [d']_0^d\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} \\left( w(d)^{3/2} - w_0^{3/2} \\right) = \\frac{2 c_{s0} \\sqrt{w_0}}{v} d\n$$\nSolving for $w(d)$:\n$$\nw(d)^{3/2} - w_0^{3/2} = \\frac{3 c_{s0} \\sqrt{w_0}}{v} d\n$$\n$$\nw(d)^{3/2} = w_0^{3/2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{3 c_{s0} d}{v w_0} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nw(d) = w_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{3 c_{s0} d}{v w_0} \\right)^{2/3}\n$$\n\n**4.
