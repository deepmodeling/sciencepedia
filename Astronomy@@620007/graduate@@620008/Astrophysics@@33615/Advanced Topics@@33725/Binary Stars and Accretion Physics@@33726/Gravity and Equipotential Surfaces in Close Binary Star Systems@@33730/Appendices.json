This practice grounds this abstract concept by calculating the effective surface gravity at two key locations on a star that has filled its Roche lobe: the substellar point facing its companion and the anti-stellar point on the far side. By working through this problem [@problem_id:219856], you will gain a concrete understanding of the extreme tidal forces that distort stars and drive mass transfer.", "problem": "In a close binary star system, two stars with masses $M_1$ and $M_2$ are in a stable, circular orbit about their common center of mass with a constant separation distance $a$. The system rotates synchronously with an orbital angular velocity $\\Omega$. The gravitational and centrifugal forces within this co-rotating frame can be described by an effective potential, $\\Phi_{eff}$, often called the Roche potential. The surface of a star that is tidally locked and distorted by its companion conforms to an equipotential surface.\n\nWhen the secondary star (mass $M_2$) expands to a critical size, it fills its **Roche lobe**. The surface of the star is then defined by the equipotential surface that passes through the inner Lagrangian point, $L_1$. Matter at the $L_1$ point is on the verge of being transferred to the primary star.\n\nThe effective gravity at any point on the star's surface is given by the vector field $\\vec{g}_{eff} = -\\nabla\\Phi_{eff}$. The magnitude of this vector, $|\\vec{g}_{eff}|$, represents the local surface gravity that a parcel of gas would experience.\n\nConsider such a system where the origin $(0,0,0)$ is the center of mass, and the stars lie along the x-axis. The center of mass of star $M_1$ is at coordinate $x_1$ and that of star $M_2$ is at $x_2$. The two points of interest on the surface of star $M_2$ that also lie on the x-axis are:\n1.  The **substellar point** ($P_s$), which is the point on the surface of $M_2$ closest to $M_1$. For a Roche-lobe-filling star, this point coincides with the $L_1$ point.\n2.  The **anti-stellar point** ($P_a$), which is the point on the surface of $M_2$ diametrically opposite to the substellar point, i.e., farthest from $M_1$. Let the coordinate of this point be $x_{anti}$.\n\nDerive a single expression for the sum of the magnitudes of the effective surface gravities at the substellar and anti-stellar points, $g_{sum} = |\\vec{g}_{eff}(P_s)| + |\\vec{g}_{eff}(P_a)|$.\n\nExpress your final answer in terms of the gravitational constant $G$, the masses $M_1$ and $M_2$, the orbital separation $a$, and the coordinate of the anti-stellar point, $x_{anti}$.", "solution": "The Roche-effective potential along the $x$-axis is\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\rm eff}(x)=-\\frac{GM_1}{|x-x_1|}-\\frac{GM_2}{|x-x_2|}-\\frac{1}{2}\\Omega^2x^2.\n$$\nFor $x>x_2$ we have $|x-x_i|=x-x_i$, so\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Phi_{\\rm eff}}{dx}\n=\\frac{GM_1}{(x-x_1)^2}+\\frac{GM_2}{(x-x_2)^2}-\\Omega^2x,\n$$\nhence the effective gravity is\n$$\ng_{\\rm eff}(x)\n=-\\frac{d\\Phi_{\\rm eff}}{dx}\n=-\\frac{GM_1}{(x-x_1)^2}-\\frac{GM_2}{(x-x_2)^2}+\\Omega^2x.\n$$\n\nAt the substellar (inner Lagrange) point $x_s$ one has $d\\Phi_{\\rm eff}/dx=0$, so $g_{\\rm eff}(P_s)=0$.
