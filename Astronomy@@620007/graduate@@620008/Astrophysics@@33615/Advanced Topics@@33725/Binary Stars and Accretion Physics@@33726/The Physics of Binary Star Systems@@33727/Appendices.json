This first practice explores the fundamental orbital dynamics under conservative mass transfer, where total mass and angular momentum are conserved. By analyzing how the orbital separation changes as mass is exchanged, you will derive the critical point at which the initially rapid, unstable mass transfer phase concludes, a key step in understanding how the initially less massive star can become the more evolved giant [@problem_id:330449].", "problem": "A close binary system consists of two stars, star 1 and star 2, with initial masses $M_{1,i}$ and $M_{2,i}$ respectively, in a circular orbit. Star 1 is initially more massive than star 2 ($M_{1,i} > M_{2,i}$). As star 1 evolves and expands, it fills its Roche lobe, initiating a phase of rapid mass transfer to star 2. This process is assumed to be fully conservative, meaning the total mass of the system and its total orbital angular momentum are both conserved.\n\nThis rapid, or \"thermal-timescale,\" mass transfer is driven by the fact that for a donor more massive than its companion, the orbit tends to shrink. This orbital shrinkage causes the donor's Roche lobe to shrink as well, which can accelerate the mass loss in a runaway feedback loop. This phase of orbital shrinkage and runaway transfer is considered to conclude at the point where the orbital separation, $a$, reaches its minimum value. After this point, the orbit begins to expand with further mass transfer, leading to a potentially more stable configuration.\n\nDerive an expression for the final mass of the donor star, $M_{1,f}$, at the end of this rapid mass transfer phase, as defined by the moment of minimum orbital separation.

A donor star transferring mass can lead to a runaway, rapid exchange on a thermal timescale, or a slow, stable transfer on a much longer nuclear timescale. This exercise delves into the critical condition that governs this transition by comparing the response of the donor star's radius to the change in its Roche lobe radius [@problem_id:330669]. Mastering this concept is essential for accurately modeling the evolutionary pathways of interacting binary systems.", "problem": "In the study of binary star evolution, Algol-type systems present a fascinating case where a less massive star is observed to be more evolved than its massive companion. This \"Algol paradox\" is resolved by considering mass transfer between the components. The stability and timescale of this mass transfer are critical for understanding the system's evolution.\n\nConsider a semi-detached binary system where a donor star of mass $M_D$ transfers mass to an accretor star of mass $M_A$. The donor star completely fills its Roche lobe. The total mass $M = M_D + M_A$ is conserved, and the orbit remains circular.\n\nThe response of the donor star's radius, $R_D$, to a change in its mass, $M_D$, is characterized by the mass-radius exponent, $\\zeta_D = \\frac{d\\ln R_D}{d\\ln M_D}$. The value of this exponent depends on the timescale of the mass loss. We are interested in the response of a star that is in thermal equilibrium, for which the exponent is denoted $\\zeta_{eq}$.\n\nMass transfer is considered stable on a thermal timescale, and thus proceeds slowly on the nuclear timescale of the donor, if the donor's radius in thermal equilibrium shrinks (or expands more slowly) than its Roche lobe upon mass loss. If this condition is not met, the mass transfer is unstable on a thermal timescale, leading to a rapid phase of mass exchange governed by the donor's Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale. The transition from the rapid phase to the slow phase occurs precisely at the threshold of thermal stability.\n\nThe effective radius of the donor's Roche lobe, $R_L$, can be approximated by the relation:\n$$\nR_L = K \\cdot a \\cdot \\left(\\frac{M_D}{M}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nwhere $a$ is the orbital semi-major axis and $K$ is a dimensionless constant of order unity.\n\nDerive the critical mass ratio, $q = M_D/M_A$, at which the system transitions from rapid, thermal-timescale mass transfer to slow, nuclear-timescale mass transfer.
