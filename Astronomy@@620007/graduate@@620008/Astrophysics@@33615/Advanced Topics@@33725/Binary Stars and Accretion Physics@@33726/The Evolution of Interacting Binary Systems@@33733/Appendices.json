This single criterion determines whether the system undergoes a slow, stable phase of evolution or a rapid, dramatic common envelope event.

Mass transfer occurs when a star (the donor, mass $M_1$) expands to fill its Roche lobe, spilling matter onto its companion (the accretor, mass $M_2$). The process is stable if the donor star shrinks, or expands slower than its Roche lobe, upon losing mass. Conversely, if the star expands faster than its Roche lobe shrinks, a runaway mass transfer ensues, which is deemed unstable.\n\nThe criterion for stable mass transfer can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\zeta_1 \\ge \\zeta_{L1}\n$$\nwhere $\\zeta_1 = \\frac{d \\ln R_1}{d \\ln M_1}$ is the mass-radius exponent of the donor star (with radius $R_1$), and $\\zeta_{L1} = \\frac{d \\ln R_{L1}}{d \\ln M_1}$ is the effective mass-radius exponent of its Roche lobe (with radius $R_{L1}$).

The donor star is a giant whose radius response to mass loss is described by the simple power-law relation $R_1 \\propto M_1^{\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant exponent.\n2.  The Roche lobe radius of the donor star is approximated by the relation $R_{L1} = C \\cdot a \\cdot q^{\\gamma}$, where $a$ is the orbital separation, $C$ is a dimensionless constant, and $\\gamma$ is a positive constant exponent that characterizes the dependence on the mass ratio $q$.\n\nYour task is to derive an expression for the critical mass ratio, $q_{crit}$, above which mass transfer becomes unstable.
