To a good approximation, the ions arrange themselves in a body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice to minimize their electrostatic energy.\n\nA powerful method for estimating the cohesive energy of such an ionic crystal is the **ion-sphere model** (also known as the Wigner-Seitz model). In this model, the complex interactions within the lattice are simplified by considering a single, representative cell. Each ion, with a positive charge $+Ze$, is assumed to be at the center of a perfectly spherical cell of radius $r_s$. This sphere contains a uniform background of negative electron charge, with a total charge of $-Ze$, thus making the cell charge-neutral. The radius $r_s$ is chosen such that the volume of the sphere is equal to the average volume per ion in the bcc lattice.\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy, $U$, of this ion-sphere system is the sum of two contributions: the interaction energy between the central ion and the background electron sphere ($U_{ib}$), and the electrostatic self-energy of the electron sphere itself ($U_{bb}$). This total energy $U$ provides an excellent approximation for the Madelung energy per ion in the crystal.\n\nYour task is to derive this energy.
