The polytropic equation of state is a well-established and physically motivated simplification for dense matter. The causality condition and the chosen parameter ranges are consistent with the known physics of neutron stars.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem describes a complete procedure for a Monte Carlo simulation. It defines an initial value problem with specific initial conditions, a clear integration method (adaptive RK4), and unambiguous termination and failure criteria. The process for sampling input parameters and calculating output statistics is mathematically precise.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is formulated using objective, technical language.

There are no apparent contradictions in the provided information. The note about $M_\\odot$ being dimensionless is slightly awkward but its intent is clear: the final mass is to be reported as a dimensionless ratio $m/M_\\odot$.\n5.  **Feasible and Realistic:** The physical and numerical parameters are within realistic ranges for this type of simulation. The computational task, while intensive, is feasible on a standard computer.\n6.  **Well-Structured:** The problem is logically structured, guiding the solver from fundamental principles (GR and EoS) through numerical implementation (TOV integration) to the final statistical analysis (UQ).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed problem in computational physics. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution implements a Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the uncertainty in the maximum mass of a neutron star, arising from uncertainties in the equation of state (EoS). The core of the simulation involves repeatedly solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations.\n\nThe overall algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case:\n1.  **Parameter Sampling:** $N$ samples of the EoS parameters $(\\Gamma, P_{\\mathrm{ref}})$ are generated according to the specified probability distributions and random seed. $\\Gamma$ is drawn from a normal distribution and then clipped to the interval $[1.8, 2.0]$. $\\log_{10} P_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is drawn from a normal distribution to compute $P_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n2.  **Maximum Mass Calculation:** For each sampled EoS:\n    a.  The polytropic constant $K = P_{\\mathrm{ref}} / \\rho_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{\\Gamma}$ is computed.\n    b.  A predefined grid of $24$ central pressures, $P_c$, is constructed.\n    c.  For each $P_c$, the TOV equations are numerically integrated from a small initial radius $r_0$ outwards. This integration yields the mass-radius profile of a star for the given $P_c$ and EoS.\n    d.  The maximum mass for the EoS, $M_{\\max}^{(i)}$, is determined by finding the maximum final mass among all stable stellar structures computed across the $P_c$ grid. If an EoS sample fails to produce any stable stars, it is discarded.\n3.  **Statistical Analysis:** The sample mean ($\\bar{M}$) and sample standard deviation ($s$) of the collected $M_{\\max}^{(i)}$ values from all valid samples are calculated.\n\nThe numerical integration of the TOV system, which is a pair of coupled first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for pressure $P(r)$ and enclosed mass $m(r)$, is performed using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. To handle the stiffness of the equations where pressure changes rapidly near the stellar surface, an adaptive step size $h$ is employed. The step size is calculated based on the local pressure scale height, $H = |P/(dP/dr)|$, and is constrained within a specified minimum and maximum range ($h_{\\min}, h_{\\max}$).\n\nThe integration for a single star begins at $r_0=10$ m with initial conditions derived assuming a uniform core density. The integration proceeds until the pressure drops below a surface threshold $P_{\\mathrm{surf}}$, at which point the integration stops. The final radius $R$ and mass $m(R)$ are determined by linear interpolation to the point where $P(r) = P_{\\mathrm{surf}}$ for greater accuracy. During integration, a critical check is performed at each step to ensure that the metric term $1 - 2Gm/rc^2$ remains positive. If it becomes non-positive, it signifies gravitational collapse to a black hole (in the context of this model), and the integration for that star is marked as a failure.\n\nThe implementation is encapsulated within a Python program, utilizing `numpy` for numerical operations. The code is structured to process each test case sequentially, compute the required statistics, and format the final output as a single comma-separated list.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the uncertainty quantification for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Physical Constants (SI units) ---\n    G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant\n    c = 2.99792458e8   # Speed of light\n    c2 = c**2\n    M_SUN = 1.98847e30 # Solar mass in kg\n\n    # --- EOS and Integration Parameters ---\n    RHO_REF = 2.8e17   # Reference rest-mass density (kg/m^3)\n    R_0 = 10.0         # Initial integration radius (m)\n    P_SURF = 1.0e30    # Surface pressure threshold (Pa)\n    H_MIN = 1.0        # Minimum step size (m)\n    H_MAX = 200.0      # Maximum step size (m)\n    ETA = 0.3          # Step size control factor\n    N_STEPS_MAX = 20000# Maximum number of integration steps\n\n    # Central pressure multipliers\n    PC_MULTIPLIERS = np.logspace(-0.30103, 1.30103, 24)\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # (N, mu_log10 P, sigma_log10 P, mu_Gamma, sigma_Gamma, seed)\n        (14, 34.6, 0.2, 1.95, 0.05, 1729),\n        (12, 34.4, 0.2, 1.90, 0.05, 2027),\n        (16, 34.8, 0.2, 1.98, 0.03, 123),\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for n_samples, mu_logp, sigma_logp, mu_gamma, sigma_gamma, seed in test_cases:\n\n        rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n\n        # Generate all random variables for the case at once\n        log_p_ref_samples = rng.normal(mu_logp, sigma_logp, n_samples)\n        p_ref_samples = 10.0**log_p_ref_samples\n        \n        gamma_samples_raw = rng.normal(mu_gamma, sigma_gamma, n_samples)\n        gamma_samples = np.clip(gamma_samples_raw, 1.8, 2.0)\n\n        max_masses = []\n\n        for i in range(n_samples):\n            gamma = gamma_samples[i]\n            p_ref = p_ref_samples[i]\n            \n            # Polytropic constant K\n            k_eos = p_ref / (RHO_REF**gamma)\n\n            masses_for_eos = []\n\n            for alpha in PC_MULTIPLIERS:\n                pc = alpha * p_ref\n\n                # --- Integration of a single star ---\n                r = R_0\n                \n                # Epsilon at center\n                if pc = 0:\n                    # Non-physical central pressure\n                    masses_for_eos.append(None)\n                    continue\n\n                rho_c = (pc / k_eos)**(1.0 / gamma)\n                eps_c = rho_c * c2 + pc / (gamma - 1.0)\n                \n                # Initial conditions\n                p = pc\n                m = (4.0 / 3.0) * np.pi * r**3 * eps_c / c2\n                \n                y = np.array([p, m])\n\n                is_stable = True\n                for step in range(N_STEPS_MAX):\n                    # Check for black hole formation\n                    schwarzschild_term = 1.0 - 2.0 * G * y[1] / (r * c2)\n                    if schwarzschild_term = 0:\n                        is_stable = False\n                        break\n\n                    # --- TOV ODE system ---\n                    rho = (y[0] / k_eos)**(1.0 / gamma) if y[0] > 0 else 0.0\n                    eps = rho * c2 + y[0] / (gamma - 1.0)\n                    \n                    dpdr = -(G * (eps + y[0] / c2) * (y[1] + 4.0 * np.pi * r**3 * y[0] / c2)\n                           / (r**2 * schwarzschild_term))\n                    dmdr = 4.0 * np.pi * r**2 * eps / c2\n                    \n                    derivatives = np.array([dpdr, dmdr])\n\n                    # --- Adaptive step size ---\n                    if dpdr == 0:\n                        h = H_MAX\n                    else:\n                        h_pressure_scale = abs(y[0] / dpdr)\n                        h = ETA * h_pressure_scale\n                    \n                    h = np.clip(h, H_MIN, H_MAX)\n\n                    # --- RK4 step ---\n                    k1 = h * derivatives\n                    \n                    # Recalculate derivatives for k2, k3, k4\n                    rho_k2 = ((y[0] + 0.5 * k1[0]) / k_eos)**(1.0 / gamma) if (y[0] + 0.5 * k1[0]) > 0 else 0.0\n                    eps_k2 = rho_k2 * c2 + (y[0] + 0.5 * k1[0]) / (gamma - 1.0)\n                    schwarzschild_term_k2 = 1.0 - 2.0 * G * (y[1] + 0.5 * k1[1]) / ((r + 0.5*h) * c2)\n                    if schwarzschild_term_k2 = 0: is_stable = False;
