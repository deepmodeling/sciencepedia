[@problem_id:373520]", "problem": "In the study of cataclysmic variable stars, Doppler tomography is a powerful indirect imaging technique used to map the velocity field of gas flows within a binary system. Consider a binary system consisting of a white dwarf of mass $M_1$ and a companion star. The white dwarf is surrounded by a gaseous accretion disk. The binary system orbits its common center of mass with a period $P$ in a circular orbit, which is observed at an inclination angle $i$.\n\nThe gas in the accretion disk is assumed to follow circular Keplerian orbits around the white dwarf in the binary's orbital plane. The Keplerian velocity of a gas parcel at a radius $R$ from the white dwarf is $V_K = \\sqrt{G M_1 / R}$. The white dwarf itself orbits the center of mass with a speed $K_1$.\n\nDoppler tomography reconstructs an image in a 2D velocity space $(v_x, v_y)$. These velocity coordinates represent the components of the gas's inertial velocity vector, but resolved along the axes of a reference frame that co-rotates with the binary. In this co-rotating frame, the origin is at the binary's center of mass, and the $x$-axis always points from the white dwarf towards the companion star.\n\nFor any point in the disk, its instantaneous inertial velocity vector, when expressed in the basis of the co-rotating frame, is given by $(v_x, v_y)$. The entire set of these velocity vectors from a continuous structure (like a ring in the disk) forms a corresponding structure in the Doppler tomogram.\n\nDerive the equation of the curve in the $(v_x, v_y)$ velocity plane that represents the emission from a thin ring of gas in the accretion disk at a constant radius $R$ from the white dwarf.

This evolution is driven by the transport of angular momentum, which allows matter to lose orbital energy and spiral inward onto the white dwarf. This problem moves beyond the standard viscous disk model to explore how external torques, such as those from a magnetic field, can also contribute to this process. By deriving the magnetic contribution to the disk's surface density evolution, you will engage with the fundamental conservation laws that are at the heart of modern accretion theory.
