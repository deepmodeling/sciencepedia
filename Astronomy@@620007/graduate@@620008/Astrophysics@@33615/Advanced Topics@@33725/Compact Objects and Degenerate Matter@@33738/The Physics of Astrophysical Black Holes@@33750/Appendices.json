In this exercise, you will calculate the radiative efficiency for a thin disk around a Schwarzschild black hole by using the specific energy of a particle at the ISCO [@problem_id:329281]. This calculation directly connects the principles of general relativity to the observed brightness of some of the most energetic objects in the universe.", "problem": "In the standard model of thin accretion disks (the Shakura-Sunyaev model), gas orbiting a central compact object, such as a black hole, is assumed to move in nearly circular Keplerian orbits. As the gas spirals inward, it loses gravitational potential energy, which is converted into heat and radiated away. This process is stable down to a certain minimum radius known as the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO). At radii smaller than the ISCO, stable circular orbits are not possible, and the gas plunges directly into the black hole, carrying its remaining kinetic and potential energy with it.\n\nThe overall efficiency of energy extraction from the accretion process is quantified by the radiative efficiency, $\\eta$. This is defined as the total energy radiated away, $L_{rad}$, divided by the rate at which rest-mass energy is accreted, $\\dot{M}c^2$, i.e., $\\eta = L_{rad} / (\\dot{M}c^2)$.
