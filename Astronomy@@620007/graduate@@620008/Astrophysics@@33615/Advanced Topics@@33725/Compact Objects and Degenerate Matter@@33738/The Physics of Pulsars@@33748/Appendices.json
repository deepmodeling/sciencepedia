The characteristic spin-down age of the pulsar is defined as $\\tau = -\\frac{\\Omega}{2\\dot{\\Omega}}$.\n\nThe superfluid interior is only weakly coupled to the crust. As the crust's rotation slows, the superfluid component tends to maintain a higher angular velocity. This creates an angular velocity lag, $\\delta\\Omega$, between the superfluid and the crust.

Let's model this process.\n\nConsider a pulsar with a crust of moment of inertia $I_c$ and a superfluid component of moment of inertia $I_s$ that participates in the glitch.
