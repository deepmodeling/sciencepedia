The explosion unbinds the star and synthesizes heavy elements, primarily $^{56}\\text{Ni}$. We will model this process to derive the net kinetic energy of the resulting ejecta.\n\n**Model Assumptions:**\n1.  Just prior to the explosion, the white dwarf has a mass $M = M_{Ch}$ and is supported by non-relativistic electron degeneracy pressure. Its structure is well-approximated by an $n=3/2$ polytrope.\n2.  The gravitational binding energy, $E_{bind}$, of an $n=3/2$ polytropic star of mass $M$ and radius $R$ is given by the relation:\n    $$E_{bind} = \\frac{3}{7} \\frac{G M^2}{R}$$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n3.  For a white dwarf described by this model, the mass and radius are related by the expression:\n    $$R M^{1/3} = K$$\n    where $K$ is a constant that depends on the composition and fundamental physical constants.\n4.  The supernova explosion is powerful enough to completely unbind the star. During the explosion, a mass $M_{Ni}$ of $^{56}\\text{Ni}$ is synthesized from the initial carbon and oxygen.\n5.

The net kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta, $E_K$, is the total nuclear energy released minus the initial gravitational binding energy required to overcome the star's self-gravity. Assume the final gravitational potential energy of the dispersed ejecta is zero.\n\n**Problem:**\nUsing the model assumptions provided, derive a closed-form expression for the net kinetic energy, $E_K$, of the supernova ejecta in terms of the Chandrasekhar mass $M_{Ch}$, the synthesized nickel mass $M_{Ni}$, the gravitational constant $G$, the mass-radius constant $K$, and the specific nuclear energy release $\\epsilon_{Ni}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the net kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta, $E_K$.
