Working through this analysis uncovers the physical origins of the Lightman-Eardley instability, a cornerstone concept for understanding outbursts and state transitions in accreting black holes.", "problem": "An accretion disk forms around a supermassive black hole of mass $M$ at the center of a galaxy. In the standard alpha-disk model, the structure of the disk is described by a set of local, vertically-averaged equations. At a given radius $r$ from the central mass, the disk has a surface density $\\Sigma$, a central temperature $T_c$, and a characteristic semi-thickness $H$. The disk is in Keplerian rotation, so the angular frequency is $\\Omega_K = \\sqrt{GM/r^3}$.\n\nThe internal pressure in the disk's midplane, $P_c$, is the sum of gas pressure and radiation pressure: $P_c = P_{gas} + P_{rad}$. The ratio of gas pressure to total pressure is denoted by $\\beta = P_{gas}/P_c$. The viscous stress, responsible for angular momentum transport and heating, is modeled as $\\tau_{r\\phi} = \\alpha P_c$, where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless viscosity parameter.\n\nThe disk's vertical structure is governed by:\n1.  **Hydrostatic Equilibrium:** $P_c = \\frac{1}{2} \\Sigma \\Omega_K^2 H$.\n2.  **Equation of State:** $P_c = \\frac{k_B}{\\mu m_p} \\rho_c T_c + \\frac{1}{3}aT_c^4$, where $\\rho_c \\approx \\Sigma/(2H)$ is the midplane density, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\\mu$ is the mean molecular weight, $m_p$ is the proton mass, and $a$ is the radiation constant.\n3.  **Energy Balance:** The viscous heating rate per unit area, $Q^+$, is balanced by the radiative cooling rate from the disk's two surfaces, $Q^-$. In the inner regions of the disk, the primary opacity source is electron scattering, with a constant opacity coefficient $\\kappa_{es}$. In this regime, the energy balance can be expressed as a relation between the disk height $H$, surface density $\\Sigma$, and the pressure ratio $\\beta$:\n    $$H = \\frac{4c(1-\\beta)}{3\\alpha\\Omega_K \\kappa_{es} \\Sigma}$$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThis set of equations leads to a non-monotonic relationship between the accretion rate $\\dot{M}$ and the surface density $\\Sigma$, often visualized as an \"S-curve\".
