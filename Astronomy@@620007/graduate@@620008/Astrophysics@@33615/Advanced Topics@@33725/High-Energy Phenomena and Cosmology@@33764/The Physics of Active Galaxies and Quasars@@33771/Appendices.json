This practice delves into the primary mechanism thought to be responsible: diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at strong shocks within AGN jets. By deriving the famous universal power-law energy spectrum from first principles [@problem_id:328606], you will gain a foundational understanding of how these cosmic accelerators operate and produce the high-energy particles that power radio lobes and gamma-ray flares.", "problem": "In the standard model of active galactic nuclei (AGN), jets interacting with the interstellar or intergalactic medium create strong shock fronts. These shocks are considered primary sites for particle acceleration up to very high energies through a process known as diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), or first-order Fermi acceleration.\n\nConsider a planar, non-relativistic, steady-state shock front. In the rest frame of the shock, the upstream (unshocked) plasma flows into the shock at a speed $u_1$, and the downstream (shocked) plasma flows away at a speed $u_2$, with $u_1 > u_2$. A population of energetic \"test particles\" (protons or electrons) is injected near the shock. These particles have speeds $v$ much greater than the plasma flow speeds ($v \\gg u_1, u_2$), and for simplicity, we assume they are highly relativistic ($v \\approx c$, where $c$ is the speed of light). The particles are trapped near the shock by scattering off magnetic irregularities, causing their motion to be diffusive and their pitch-angle distribution to be isotropic in the rest frame of the local plasma on either side of the shock.\n\nParticles gain energy by repeatedly crossing the shock front. A particle completing a full cycle (crossing from upstream to downstream, and then back to upstream) experiences a net energy gain. However, a particle that crosses into the downstream region also has a finite probability of being advected away by the plasma flow before it can return to the shock. The balance between continuous energy gain and probable escape establishes a power-law energy spectrum for the accelerated particles.\n\nYour task is to derive the spectral index of the differential energy spectrum of these particles. The spectrum is of the form $N(E) dE \\propto E^{-s} dE$, where $N(E)$ is the number density of particles per unit energy.\n\nTo do this, proceed as follows:\n1.  **Energy Gain:** The average energy gain for a relativistic particle of momentum $p$ and energy $E=pc$ during a single crossing of the shock (in either direction) can be shown to be $\\langle \\Delta E_{\\text{cross}} \\rangle = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{E}{c} (u_1 - u_2)$, by averaging over an isotropic particle flux. A full acceleration cycle involves two shock crossings (upstream-to-downstream and downstream-to-upstream). Assuming the energy gain is the same for both crossings, determine the average fractional energy gain per cycle, $\\beta = \\frac{\\langle \\Delta E_{\\text{cycle}} \\rangle}{E}$.\n\n2.  **Escape Probability:** A particle in the downstream region is subject to two competing transport processes: diffusion, which can return it to the shock, and advection with the downstream flow, which carries it away. For a relativistic, isotropic particle population of number density $n$, the kinetic flux (current density) of particles crossing a plane from one side is $J_{\\text{diff}} = nc/4$. The advective flux is $J_{\\text{adv}} = n u_2$. The probability of escape per cycle, $P_{\\text{esc}}$, can be estimated as the ratio of the advective flux to the total flux of particles leaving the near-shock region downstream (advective plus diffusive). Derive an expression for $P_{\\text{esc}}$ in terms of $u_2$ and $c$.\n\n3.  **Spectral Index:** A steady-state power-law spectrum results from the balance between energy gain and particle loss. Consider a population of $N_k$ particles that have completed $k$ acceleration cycles and reached an energy $E_k$. After one more cycle, the population becomes $N_{k+1} = N_k (1 - P_{\\text{esc}})$ with energy $E_{k+1} = E_k (1+\\beta)$. By treating the number of cycles $k$ as a continuous variable and taking the limit of small $\\beta$ and $P_{\\text{esc}}$, find the relationship between $N(E)$ and $E$. From this, derive the differential energy spectral index, $s$, in terms of the upstream and downstream plasma velocities, $u_1$ and $u_2$.", "solution": "The goal is to derive the differential energy spectral index $s$ for particles accelerated at a non-relativistic shock front.

An acceleration cycle consists of two crossings: one from upstream to downstream and one from downstream to upstream.

Derivation of the Escape Probability per Cycle ($P_{\\text{esc}}$)**\n\nParticles that cross into the downstream region can either diffuse back to the shock or be advected away. The escape probability is the fraction of particles that are advected away. We compare the advective flux to the total flux leaving the downstream region near the shock.\n\nThe diffusive flux of particles returning to the shock is given as $J_{\\text{diff}} = nc/4$.\nThe advective flux of particles carried away from the shock is given as $J_{\\text{adv}} = n u_2$.\n\nThe total flux of particles leaving the downstream region is the sum of these two competing fluxes:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{total}} = J_{\\text{diff}} + J_{\\text{adv}} = \\frac{nc}{4} + n u_2\n$$\n\nThe probability of escape, $P_{\\text{esc}}$, is the ratio of the advective flux to the total flux:\n$$\nP_{\\text{esc}} = \\frac{J_{\\text{adv}}}{J_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{n u_2}{\\frac{nc}{4} + n u_2} = \\frac{u_2}{\\frac{c}{4} + u_2}\n$$\n\nSince the particles are highly energetic ($v \\approx c$) and the shock is non-relativistic ($u_2 \\ll c$), we can make the approximation $c/4 + u_2 \\approx c/4$.\n\n$$\nP_{\\text{esc}} \\approx \\frac{u_2}{c/4} = \\frac{4u_2}{c}\n$$\n\n**3.
