The P-L relation is calibrated by measuring the periods and mean apparent magnitudes of a sample of Cepheids at a known distance. An accurate determination of the mean magnitude is therefore paramount.\n\nCepheid light curves, which show the variation of magnitude over time, are characteristically asymmetric, often exhibiting a rapid rise to maximum brightness followed by a slower decline.
