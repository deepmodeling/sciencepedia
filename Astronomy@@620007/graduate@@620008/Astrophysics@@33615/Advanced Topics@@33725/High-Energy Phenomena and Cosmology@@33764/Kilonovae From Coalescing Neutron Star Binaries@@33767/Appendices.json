This process is responsible for the creation of many heavy elements in the universe, and its progression is governed by the competition between neutron captures and beta-decays. The r-process effectively terminates, or \"freezes out,\" when the neutron density of the expanding ejecta drops to a point where the timescale for neutron capture on a heavy nucleus becomes longer than the timescale for the nucleus to undergo beta-decay.\n\nConsider a simplified model of the r-process freeze-out in the ejecta of a neutron star merger. The free neutrons are in thermal equilibrium with the plasma at a temperature $T$ and have a mass $m_n$. Their speed distribution is described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The neutron capture timescale, $\\tau_n$, for a typical heavy nucleus is the inverse of the neutron capture rate, $R_n$. This rate is given by $R_n = n_n \\langle \\sigma_n v \\rangle$, where $n_n$ is the free neutron number density and $\\langle \\sigma_n v \\rangle$ is the neutron capture cross-section, $\\sigma_n$, averaged over the thermal velocity, $v$, of the neutrons.\n\nFor this problem, assume that the neutron capture cross-section for a representative heavy nucleus at the end of the r-process path is a constant, $\\sigma_0$, independent of the neutron energy.
