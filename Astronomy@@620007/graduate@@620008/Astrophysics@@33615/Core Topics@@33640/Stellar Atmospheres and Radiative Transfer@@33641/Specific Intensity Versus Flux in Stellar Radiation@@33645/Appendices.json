This practice is essential for building an intuition for how surface features, like starspots, affect the total light we receive.", "problem": "A non-rotating, spherical star of radius $R$ is observed by a distant observer at a distance $D$, where $D \\gg R$. The star's surface is considered to be a perfect blackbody, but its temperature is not uniform. Instead, the surface is sharply divided into two hemispheres with different, uniform temperatures. One hemisphere has a temperature $T_1$ and the other has a temperature $T_2$. The boundary between these hemispheres is a great circle. Let us define a \"thermal axis\" as the axis passing through the star's center and perpendicular to this great circle.\n\nThe observer measures the bolometric flux from the star for two different viewing geometries:\n1.  **Pole-on view:** The line of sight from the observer to the star is aligned with the thermal axis. The hemisphere with temperature $T_1$ is oriented towards the observer.\n2.  **Equator-on view:** The line of sight is perpendicular to the thermal axis.\n\nAssume the specific intensity of radiation from the blackbody surface is given by $I = \\sigma T^4 / \\pi$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the local surface temperature.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the ratio, $\\mathcal{R}$, of the bolometric flux measured in the pole-on configuration ($F_{\\text{pole-on}}$) to that measured in the equator-on configuration ($F_{\\text{equator-on}}$).", "solution": "The bolometric flux $F$ received by a distant observer from a resolved source is given by the integral of the specific bolometric intensity $I$ over the solid angle $\\Omega$ subtended by the source as seen by the observer.\n$$\nF = \\int_{\\text{source}} I d\\Omega\n$$\nThe specific intensity $I$ from a blackbody surface patch at temperature $T$ is isotropic and given by an integral of the Planck function over all frequencies, which yields $I = \\frac{\\sigma T^4}{\\pi}$.\n\nThe element of solid angle $d\\Omega$ corresponding to a projected area element $dA_{\\text{proj}}$ on the plane of the sky at a distance $D$ is $d\\Omega = \\frac{dA_{\\text{proj}}}{D^2}$. Since the star is distant, it appears as a flat disk of radius $R$. The projected area element is an area element on this disk. The flux integral can be written as an integral over the apparent disk of the star:\n$$\nF = \\frac{1}{D^2} \\int_{\\text{disk}} I(x,y) dA_{\\text{proj}}\n$$\nwhere $I(x,y)$ is the specific intensity from the part of the stellar surface that projects to the point $(x,y)$ on the disk.

Pole-on Flux ($F_{\\text{pole-on}}$)**\n\nIn the pole-on configuration, the thermal axis is aligned with the line of sight. The problem states that the hemisphere with temperature $T_1$ is facing the observer. This means that the entire visible hemisphere of the star, which projects to the observed disk, has a uniform temperature $T_1$. The other hemisphere with temperature $T_2$ is on the far side of the star and is not visible.\n\nTherefore, the temperature across the entire observed disk is constant: $T(x,y) = T_1$. The integral becomes:\n$$\nF_{\\text{pole-on}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\pi D^2} \\int_{\\text{disk}} T_1^4 dA_{\\text{proj}}\n$$\nThe integral is simply $T_1^4$ multiplied by the area of the disk, which is $A_{\\text{disk}} = \\pi R^2$.\n$$\nF_{\\text{pole-on}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\pi D^2} T_1^4 (\\pi R^2) = \\frac{\\sigma R^2 T_1^4}{D^2}\n$$\n\n**2. Equator-on Flux ($F_{\\text{equator-on}}$)**\n\nIn the equator-on configuration, the line of sight is perpendicular to the thermal axis. We can set up a coordinate system where the observer is on the z-axis, and the thermal axis is aligned with the x-axis. The observed disk lies in the xy-plane.\n\nA point on the stellar surface has temperature $T_1$ if its x-coordinate is positive and $T_2$ if its x-coordinate is negative. Consequently, the observed disk is split into two semi-disks by the y-axis (where $x=0$). The semi-disk with $x>0$ corresponds to the hemisphere with temperature $T_1$, and the semi-disk with $x0$ corresponds to the hemisphere with temperature $T_2$.\n\nThe flux integral must be split into two parts:\n$$\nF_{\\text{equator-on}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\pi D^2} \\left( \\int_{\\text{semi-disk, } x>0} T_1^4 dA_{\\text{proj}} + \\int_{\\text{semi-disk, } x0} T_2^4 dA_{\\text{proj}} \\right)\n$$\nThe area of each semi-disk is half the total area of the disk, i.e., $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi R^2$.\n$$\nF_{\\text{equator-on}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\pi D^2} \\left( T_1^4 \\left(\\frac{\\pi R^2}{2}\\right) + T_2^4 \\left(\\frac{\\pi R^2}{2}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the common terms, we get:\n$$\nF_{\\text{equator-on}} = \\frac{\\sigma \\pi R^2}{2 \\pi D^2} (T_1^4 + T_2^4) = \\frac{\\sigma R^2}{2 D^2} (T_1^4 + T_2^4)\n$$\n\n**3.
