The rotation axis of the star is inclined at an angle $i$ with respect to the observer's line of sight. The star has an equatorial rotational velocity of $v_e$.

The shape of a stellar absorption line is influenced by various physical phenomena, including thermal motion, microscopic turbulence, pressure broadening, stellar rotation, and large-scale convective motions (granulation).\n\nFor a star like the Sun, convective blueshift arises because hot, rising gas (granules) is brighter and covers more area than the cooler, sinking gas in the surrounding intergranular lanes. This systematically blueshifts the core of the intrinsic spectral line, making it asymmetric. When this asymmetric local line profile is integrated over a differentially rotating stellar disk, the resulting disk-integrated profile is also asymmetric.\n\nConsider a simplified model for such a disk-integrated, asymmetric absorption line profile, $P(v)$, where $v$ is the velocity offset from the line center.
