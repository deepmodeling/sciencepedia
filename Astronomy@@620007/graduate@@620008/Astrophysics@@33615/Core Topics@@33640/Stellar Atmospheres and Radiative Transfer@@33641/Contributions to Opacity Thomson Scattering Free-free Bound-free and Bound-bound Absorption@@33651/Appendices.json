It is particularly important in astrophysics for understanding the opacity of stellar material, as it provides a check on calculated sets of absorption line strengths.\n\nConsider a single non-relativistic electron of mass $m$ and charge $-e$ moving in a static, but otherwise arbitrary, electromagnetic potential. The potential is described by a scalar potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$ and a magnetic vector potential $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})$. The Hamiltonian for the electron is given by:\n$$H = \\frac{1}{2m}(\\mathbf{p} + e\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r}))^2 + V(\\mathbf{r})$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{p}$ is the canonical momentum operator and $\\mathbf{r}$ is the position operator.

Note that both $V(\\mathbf{r})$ and $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})$ are functions of the position operator only.\n\nThe electric dipole oscillator strength, $f_{ba}$, for a transition from an initial eigenstate $|a\\rangle$ to a final eigenstate $|b\\rangle$ of the Hamiltonian $H$ is defined as:\n$$f_{ba} = \\frac{2m(E_b - E_a)}{3\\hbar^2} |\\langle b | \\mathbf{r} | a \\rangle|^2$$\nwhere $E_a$ and $E_b$ are the energy eigenvalues corresponding to states $|a\\rangle$ and $|b\\rangle$, and $|\\langle b | \\mathbf{r} | a \\rangle|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^3 |\\langle b | r_i | a \\rangle|^2$.\n\nYour task is to derive the TRK sum rule.

The final answer should be a single numerical constant.", "solution": "The derivation hinges on relating the sum of oscillator strengths to the expectation value of a double commutator.\n\n1.  **Rewrite the Sum Rule:**\n    Start with the definition of the sum of oscillator strengths, $S$:\n    $$S = \\sum_b f_{ba} = \\sum_b \\frac{2m(E_b - E_a)}{3\\hbar^2} \\sum_{i=1}^3 |\\langle b | r_i | a \\rangle|^2$$\n    We can swap the summations and regroup the terms:\n    $$S = \\frac{2m}{3\\hbar^2} \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\left( \\sum_b (E_b - E_a) |\\langle b | r_i | a \\rangle|^2 \\right)$$\n\n2.  **Introduce the Double Commutator Identity:**\n    The key is to use the identity:\n    $$\\sum_b (E_b - E_a) |\\langle b | r_i | a \\rangle|^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\langle a | [[H, r_i], r_i] | a \\rangle$$\n    This identity can be proven by expanding the matrix element of the double commutator, $[[H, r_i], r_i] = Hr_i^2 - 2r_iHr_i + r_i^2H$. Since $|a\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $H$, we have:\n    $$\\langle a | [[H, r_i], r_i] | a \\rangle = E_a\\langle a|r_i^2|a\\rangle - 2\\langle a|r_iHr_i|a\\rangle + E_a\\langle a|r_i^2|a\\rangle$$\n    Inserting the completeness relation $\\sum_b |b\\rangle\\langle b| = 1$ in the middle term gives:\n    $$-2\\langle a|r_iH r_i|a\\rangle = -2 \\sum_b \\langle a|r_i|b\\rangle\\langle b|H r_i|a\\rangle = -2 \\sum_b E_b |\\langle b|r_i|a\\rangle|^2$$\n    Substituting back, we get:\n    $$\\langle a | [[H, r_i], r_i] | a \\rangle = 2E_a\\langle a|r_i^2|a\\rangle - 2\\sum_b E_b |\\langle b|r_i|a\\rangle|^2 = -2 \\sum_b (E_b - E_a) |\\langle b|r_i|a\\rangle|^2$$\n    This confirms the identity.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Double Commutator:**\n    Next, we compute the operator $[[H, r_i], r_i]$.
