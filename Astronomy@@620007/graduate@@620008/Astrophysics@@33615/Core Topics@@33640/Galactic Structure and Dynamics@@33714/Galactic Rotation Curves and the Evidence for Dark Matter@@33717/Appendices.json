By calculating the \"phantom\" dark matter density that a Newtonian observer would infer in a hypothetical MOND universe, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how MOND is constructed to replicate the observational effects attributed to dark matter, thus clarifying the core of the debate: is it missing mass or missing physics [@problem_id:212196]?", "problem": "**Background:** The discrepancy between the observed rotation curves of galaxies and those predicted by Newtonian gravity based on visible matter is one of the cornerstones of the dark matter hypothesis. An alternative paradigm, Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), suggests that this discrepancy arises not from unseen matter, but from a modification of dynamics in the low-acceleration regime.\n\n**Hypothetical Model:** In this MOND-like theory, the true gravitational acceleration $g$ experienced by a test particle is related to the acceleration $g_N$ predicted by standard Newtonian gravity via the equation:\n$$g_N = \\mu\\left(\\frac{g}{a_0}\\right) g$$\nwhere $a_0$ is a fundamental constant with units of acceleration and $g_N$ is the gravitational field strength calculated from the baryonic mass $M$ (i.e., $g_N = GM/r^2$).
