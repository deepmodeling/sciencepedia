This problem investigates the sensitivity of this rate to the central pressure of a star like the Sun.\n\n**Model Assumptions:**\n1.  The stellar core at its center (subscript 'c') is a fully ionized plasma. It behaves as a non-degenerate ideal gas, where the central pressure $P_c$ and mass density $\\rho_c$ are related by the equation of state $P_c = \\frac{\\rho_c k_B T_c}{\\mu m_p}$. Here, $T_c$ is the central temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $m_p$ is the proton mass, and $\\mu$ is the mean molecular weight.\n2.  The nucleus $^{7}\\text{Be}$ is in nuclear statistical equilibrium, meaning its production rate (from $^{3}\\text{He} + ^{4}\\text{He}$) is balanced by its total destruction rate (from $^{7}\\text{Be} + e^{-}$ and $^{7}\\text{Be} + p$).\n3.  The volumetric rate of a thermonuclear reaction between species $i$ and $j$ is given by $r_{ij} \\propto n_i n_j \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{ij}$, where $n_i$ is the number density of species $i$ and $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{ij}$ is the thermally-averaged reaction rate per particle pair.\n4.  In the dense plasma, reaction rates are enhanced by a screening factor, $f_{scr}$, such that $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{ij} = \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{ij,0} f_{scr,ij}$, where the subscript '0' denotes the bare (unscreened) rate. The screening factor is given by $f_{scr} = \\exp(U_{scr} / k_B T_c)$, where $U_{scr}$ is the screening potential energy.\n5.
