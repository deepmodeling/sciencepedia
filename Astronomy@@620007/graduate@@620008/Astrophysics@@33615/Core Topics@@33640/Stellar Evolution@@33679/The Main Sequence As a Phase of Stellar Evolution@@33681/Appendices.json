For massive stars, the core is convective, meaning the material within it is well-mixed.\n\nConsider a massive star of total mass $M$ and constant luminosity $L$. The star is initially of uniform composition with a hydrogen mass fraction $X_0$. The energy released per unit mass of hydrogen fused into helium is a constant, $\\mathcal{E}$. The star's main sequence phase ends when hydrogen is exhausted at its center.\n\nWe will compare two simplified models for the evolution of the star's convective core.\n\n**Model A (Fully Mixed Core):**\nThe convective core is assumed to have a fixed mass, equal to its initial mass $m_{c,0}$, throughout the entire main-sequence lifetime. This core is treated as a single, perfectly mixed fuel reservoir. The main sequence ends when the hydrogen abundance in this entire core drops to zero.\n\n**Model B (Shrinking Core):**\nDetailed stellar models show that the convective core of a massive star shrinks as it evolves on the main sequence. In this model, the mass of the convective core, $m_c$, is a function of its uniform hydrogen mass fraction, $X_c$. This relationship is described by the power law:\n$$m_c(X_c) = m_{c,0} \\left( \\frac{X_c}{X_0} \\right)^\\beta$$\nwhere $m_{c,0}$ is the initial core mass at time $t=0$ (when $X_c=X_0$), and $\\beta$ is a positive constant that parameterizes the rate of core shrinkage. As the boundary of the convective core recedes in mass, the hydrogen abundance in the layers left behind is \"frozen\" at the value of $X_c$ at that moment.
