During the main sequence (core hydrogen-burning), the hydrogen within this core is converted to helium. The mass of the hydrogen fuel is thus $X M_c$. In the subsequent core helium-burning phase, the entire core, now composed of helium with mass $M_c$, serves as the fuel.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Scaling:** Assume the star's luminosity is governed by the homology relation for a radiation pressure-dominated star with constant opacity due to electron scattering: $L \\propto \\mu^4 M^3$, where $\\mu$ is the mean molecular weight of the stellar gas.\n\n3.  **Mean Molecular Weight:** For a fully ionized gas, the mean molecular weight $\\mu$ is given by the relation:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{\\mu} = 2X + \\frac{3}{4}Y + \\frac{1}{2}Z\n    $$\n    To estimate the luminosities during the two burning phases ($L_H$ and $L_{He}$), you are to model the star as being chemically homogeneous.

The Roche lobe of a star is the region of space where material is gravitationally bound to that star. Its size is critical for determining when and how mass transfer to a companion star occurs.
