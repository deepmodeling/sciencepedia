The star's luminosity, $L$, is predominantly determined by the mass of its core, $M_c$, through a steep relationship often modeled as a power-law. The evolution along the RGB is driven by the growth of this core as the hydrogen-burning shell consumes fuel from the overlying envelope and deposits helium \"ash\" onto the core.\n\nDuring its evolution, the star's convective envelope deepens, reaching down to layers that were previously processed by nuclear burning. This event, known as the first dredge-up, homogenizes the outer part of the star, creating a sharp discontinuity in the hydrogen abundance profile at some mass coordinate $M_D$.\n\nEventually, the outward-advancing hydrogen-burning shell reaches this discontinuity.
