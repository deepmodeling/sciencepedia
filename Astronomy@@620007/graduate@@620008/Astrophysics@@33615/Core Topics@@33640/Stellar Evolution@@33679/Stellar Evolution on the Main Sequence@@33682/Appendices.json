The rate of this fusion is not uniform across all particle energies; instead, it depends profoundly on both the stellar temperature and the quantum mechanical nature of nuclei. This exercise invites you to explore the \"Gamow peak,\" the specific and narrow energy range where fusion reactions are most probable. By modeling this peak, you will gain a hands-on understanding of the delicate interplay between the classical energy distribution of particles and the quantum probability of tunneling through the Coulomb barrier, a concept that is foundational to calculating all thermonuclear reaction rates in stars [@problem_id:270257].", "problem": "In the study of thermonuclear reactions in stars, the rate of a non-resonant reaction between two nuclei is proportional to an integral over the center-of-mass energy $E$.

This exercise challenges you to move beyond a static picture of a star's interior and quantify the impact of this core shrinkage on the main-sequence lifetime.

The main sequence ends when the hydrogen abundance in this entire core drops to zero.\n\n**Model B (Shrinking Core):**\nDetailed stellar models show that the convective core of a massive star shrinks as it evolves on the main sequence. In this model, the mass of the convective core, $m_c$, is a function of its uniform hydrogen mass fraction, $X_c$. This relationship is described by the power law:\n$$m_c(X_c) = m_{c,0} \\left( \\frac{X_c}{X_0} \\right)^\\beta$$\nwhere $m_{c,0}$ is the initial core mass at time $t=0$ (when $X_c=X_0$), and $\\beta$ is a positive constant that parameterizes the rate of core shrinkage.
