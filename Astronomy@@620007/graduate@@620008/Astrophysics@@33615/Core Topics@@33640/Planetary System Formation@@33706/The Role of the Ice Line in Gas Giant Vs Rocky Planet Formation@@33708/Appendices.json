The temperature in the disk decreases with distance from the star. The \"snow line\" (or ice line) is the radius beyond which volatile compounds, such as water, can condense into solid ice grains. This has a profound impact on planet formation.\n\nInside the snow line, planetesimals are formed primarily from silicates and metals (rock). Outside the snow line, planetesimals are composites of both rock and ice, with ice significantly increasing the available solid mass.\n\nFor a planetesimal to grow into a protoplanet and eventually a planet, its self-gravity must be sufficient to overcome its internal material strength. This allows it to accrete more material and pull itself into a nearly spherical shape (hydrostatic equilibrium). Consider a simplified model where this transition occurs when the central pressure due to self-gravity equals the material's compressive strength.\n\nAssume the following:\n1.  Planetesimals are non-rotating, uniform spheres.\n2.  Inside the snow line, a planetesimal is a pure silicate body with density $\\rho_r$ and compressive strength $S_r$.\n3.  Outside the snow line, a planetesimal is a composite body made of silicate and ice, with a constant ice mass fraction $f_{ice}$. The pure silicate and pure ice have densities $\\rho_r$ and $\\rho_i$, and strengths $S_r$ and $S_i$, respectively.\n4.  The density of the composite body, $\\rho_{comp}$, is determined by assuming the total volume is the sum of the constituent volumes.\n5.  The compressive strength of the composite body, $S_{comp}$, is dominated by the much weaker icy component, such that $S_{comp} = S_i$.\n6.  The universal gravitational constant is denoted by $G$.\n\nDerive an expression for the ratio $\\mathcal{R} = R_{r,min} / R_{comp,min}$, where $R_{r,min}$ is the minimum radius for a pure silicate planetesimal to become gravity-dominated, and $R_{comp,min}$ is the corresponding minimum radius for an ice-rock composite planetesimal.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the minimum radii required for self-gravity to overcome material strength for a pure silicate planetesimal versus an ice-rock composite planetesimal.\n\nFirst, we determine the central pressure, $P_c$, inside a uniform spherical body of radius $R$ and density $\\rho$. The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dr} = -\\rho g(r)\n$$\nwhere $g(r)$ is the gravitational acceleration at a distance $r$ from the center.
