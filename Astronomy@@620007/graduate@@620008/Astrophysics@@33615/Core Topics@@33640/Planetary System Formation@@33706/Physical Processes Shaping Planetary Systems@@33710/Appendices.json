In a protoplanetary disk, gas orbits slightly slower than the Keplerian speed due to pressure support, creating a headwind that causes solid particles to lose angular momentum and spiral inward. This practice explores a theoretical solution to this problem involving the internal structure of dust aggregates.

The core has a uniform density $\\rho_c$ and specific heat capacity $c_c$.\n2.  The heat capacity of the mantle is negligible compared to that of the core. Consequently, the temperature profile within the mantle adjusts instantaneously to changes in the core's temperature.

The motion within the plane of the orbit specific to the triangular configuration gives rise to two fundamental libration frequencies, a short-period frequency $\\omega_s$ and a long-period frequency $\\omega_l$.
