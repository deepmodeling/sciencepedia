This exercise explores the concept of a collisional cascade, a steady-state where the creation of larger bodies is balanced by the destruction of others. By deriving the exponent of the particle mass distribution, you will gain insight into the fundamental statistics that govern the availability of planetary building blocks, a key input for all subsequent stages of formation [@problem_id:321802].", "problem": "In the context of planet formation within a protoplanetary disk, a collisional cascade is a steady-state scenario where a power-law mass distribution of particles, $n(m) \\propto m^{-\\alpha}$, is maintained by a balance between coagulation and fragmentation processes. This problem concerns the derivation of the exponent $\\alpha$ in a fragmentation-dominated regime.\n\nConsider a population of solid particles with uniform internal density $\\rho$. The particles are characterized by their mass $m$ and radius $R$. The mass distribution is assumed to follow the power-law form $n(m) = C m^{-\\alpha}$ over a wide range of masses, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nThe following physical model for particle interactions is posited:\n\n1.  **Relative Velocity:** The relative velocity between two colliding particles of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$ depends on their masses as $v_{rel}(m_1, m_2) = v_0 \\left(\\frac{m_1+m_2}{m_0}\\right)^\\zeta$, where $v_0$, $m_0$, and $\\zeta$ are positive constants.\n\n2.  **Collision Kernel:** The collision rate coefficient (the kernel) is determined by the geometric cross-section and relative velocity: $K(m_1, m_2) = \\pi(R_1+R_2)^2 v_{rel}(m_1, m_2)$.\n\n3.  **Fragmentation Condition:** A target particle of mass $m$ is catastrophically destroyed upon collision with a projectile of mass $m_p$. This occurs if the kinetic energy of the impact exceeds the target's binding energy. For this problem, you may assume that the projectiles causing fragmentation are much smaller than the target, i.e., $m_p \\ll m$.\n\n4.  **Binding Energy:** The specific binding energy (energy per unit mass required for disruption) of a target body, $Q_D^*$, scales with its mass as $Q_D^* = Q_0 \\left(\\frac{m}{m_0}\\right)^\\delta$, where $Q_0$, $m_0$, and $\\delta$ are positive constants.\n\n5.  **Steady-State Cascade:** A steady-state is achieved when the characteristic timescale for a particle's destruction, $T_{dest}(m)$, is the same for all masses $m$.\n\n6.  **Destruction Timescale Approximation:** The inverse of the destruction timescale, $T_{dest}(m)^{-1}$, is proportional to the rate of shattering collisions. This rate is dominated by the flux of the smallest projectiles capable of fragmentation. It can be approximated as $T_{dest}(m)^{-1} \\propto K(m, m_{crit}) n(m_{crit}) m_{crit}$, where $m_{crit}$ is the minimum projectile mass required to shatter the target $m$.\n\nBased on this model, derive an expression for the mass distribution exponent $\\alpha$ in terms of the velocity scaling exponent $\\zeta$ and the binding energy scaling exponent $\\delta$.", "solution": "We seek $\\alpha$ such that the destruction timescale $T_{\\rm dest}(m)$ is independent of $m$.  \n\n1.

It is surrounded by a gaseous envelope that is in quasi-static hydrostatic equilibrium. The gas in the envelope is assumed to be ideal and isothermal, with a constant temperature $T$ and a mean molecular weight $\\mu$.\n\nFor this problem, make the critical simplifying assumption that the mass of the envelope is negligible compared to the mass of the core ($M_{env} \\ll M_c$). Therefore, the gravitational acceleration at any radius $r$ within the envelope (where $r \\ge R_c$) is determined solely by the core's mass.\n\nThe envelope is bounded by the surface of the core at the inner radius $R_c$ and extends to an outer radius $R_{out}$.

The Bondi radius is the radius at which the escape velocity from the protoplanet equals the sound speed of the ambient gas.\n\nThe protoplanetary disk itself has a characteristic vertical thickness known as the pressure scale height, $H$. This scale height arises from the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium between the gas pressure gradient and the vertical component of the central star's gravity.
