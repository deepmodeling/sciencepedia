This region was maintained in a state of nearly complete ionization by a central massive star. At time $t=0$, the central star abruptly ceases its emission of ionizing photons, and the nebula becomes a \"fossil\" HII region.

At the moment the star dies, $t=0$, the gas is fully ionized, so $n_p(0) = n_H$.\n\nAs the plasma recombines, electrons cascading down the energy levels of hydrogen atoms emit photons, resulting in characteristic emission lines. The luminosity of a given recombination line, such as H$\\alpha$, is proportional to the total rate of recombinations producing that line within the nebula's volume.
