The thermal properties of the gas dictate the outcome of the collapse. If the gas can cool efficiently, the collapse is nearly isothermal, and the Jeans mass decreases with increasing density, promoting fragmentation. Conversely, if cooling is inefficient, the gas heats up, the collapse becomes nearly adiabatic, and the Jeans mass increases, thus halting fragmentation.\n\nThe transition between these two regimes can be characterized by an effective polytropic index, $\\gamma_{\\text{eff}}$, defined by the relation $P \\propto \\rho^{\\gamma_{\\text{eff}}}$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\\rho$ is the density of the gas.
