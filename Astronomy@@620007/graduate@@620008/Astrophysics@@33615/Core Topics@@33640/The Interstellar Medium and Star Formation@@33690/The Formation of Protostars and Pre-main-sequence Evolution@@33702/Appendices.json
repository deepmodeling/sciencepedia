A central protostar of mass $M$ has formed, and it is accreting surrounding gas. In the inner region of the envelope, the gas is in a steady, spherically symmetric, isothermal free-fall.\n\n**Model Assumptions:**\n1.  The gravitational potential is dominated by the central protostar, so the gas infall velocity at a radius $r$ is given by the free-fall velocity:\n    $$v(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}$$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n2.  The mass accretion rate, $\\dot{M}$, is constant throughout the flow. For a steady, spherical flow, the gas mass density $\\rho(r)$ is related to the accretion rate by the continuity equation:\n    $$\\dot{M} = 4\\pi r^2 \\rho(r) v(r)$$\n\n3.  We are interested in the abundance of a trace molecular species, X, defined as $Y_X(r) = \\frac{n_X(r)}{n_{H_2}(r)}$, where $n_X$ and $n_{H_2}$ are the number densities of species X and molecular hydrogen, respectively. The evolution of this abundance is determined by a balance between two processes:\n    -   **Freeze-out:** Molecules of species X accrete onto the surfaces of cold dust grains.\n    -   **Desorption:** Cosmic rays induce the desorption of molecules from grain surfaces back into the gas phase.\n\nFor a fluid parcel moving with the flow, the rate of change of abundance is described by the following ordinary differential equation in the steady-state framework:\n$$v(r) \\frac{dY_X}{dr} = -Y_X k_{acc}(r) + k_{des}$$\n\n4.  The desorption rate, $k_{des}$, is constant. The accretion rate coefficient, $k_{acc}(r)$, is proportional to the local gas density:\n    $$k_{acc}(r) = K v_{th} \\rho(r)$$\n    where $K$ (a constant related to dust properties) and $v_{th}$ (the constant thermal velocity of molecule X) are model parameters.\n\n5.  At an outer reference radius $r_0$, the system is in local chemical equilibrium, where the freeze-out and desorption processes are perfectly balanced. This equilibrium condition is expressed as:\n    $$v(r_0) \\frac{dY_X}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=r_0} = 0$$\n    The abundance at this equilibrium radius is denoted as $Y_{X,0}$.\n\n**Problem:**\nDerive the radial abundance profile $Y_X(r)$ for the region $r \\le r_0$. Express your final answer solely in terms of the equilibrium abundance $Y_{X,0}$, the normalized radius $\\frac{r}{r_0}$, and the dimensionless parameter $\\beta$ defined as:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{K v_{th} \\dot{M}}{8\\pi G M}$$", "solution": "**Step 1: Set up the governing differential equation**\n\nThe problem provides the governing differential equation for the abundance $Y_X(r)$:\n$$v(r) \\frac{dY_X}{dr} = -Y_X k_{acc}(r) + k_{des}$$\nSubstituting $k_{acc}(r) = K v_{th} \\rho(r)$, we get:\n$$v(r) \\frac{dY_X}{dr} = -Y_X (K v_{th} \\rho(r)) + k_{des}$$\nTo solve this equation, we first need to express its coefficients as functions of $r$. We divide by $v(r)$:\n$$\\frac{dY_X}{dr} = -Y_X \\left( \\frac{K v_{th} \\rho(r)}{v(r)} \\right) + \\frac{k_{des}}{v(r)}$$\n\n**Step 2: Express coefficients as functions of radius $r$**\n\nWe use the given physical relations to find $\\rho(r)$ and subsequently the coefficients.\nFrom the continuity equation, $\\rho(r) = \\frac{\\dot{M}}{4\\pi r^2 v(r)}$.\nThe coefficient of the $Y_X$ term involves the ratio $\\frac{\\rho(r)}{v(r)}$:\n$$\\frac{\\rho(r)}{v(r)} = \\frac{1}{v(r)} \\left( \\frac{\\dot{M}}{4\\pi r^2 v(r)} \\right) = \\frac{\\dot{M}}{4\\pi r^2 v(r)^2}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the free-fall velocity, $v(r)^2 = \\frac{2GM}{r}$:\n$$\\frac{\\rho(r)}{v(r)} = \\frac{\\dot{M}}{4\\pi r^2 \\left( \\frac{2GM}{r} \\right)} = \\frac{\\dot{M}}{8\\pi GM r}$$\nThe coefficient of $Y_X$ is therefore:\n$$\\frac{K v_{th} \\rho(r)}{v(r)} = K v_{th} \\left( \\frac{\\dot{M}}{8\\pi GM r} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{K v_{th} \\dot{M}}{8\\pi GM} \\right) \\frac{1}{r}$$\nUsing the provided definition of the dimensionless parameter $\\beta = \\frac{K v_{th} \\dot{M}}{8\\pi G M}$, this coefficient becomes $\\frac{\\beta}{r}$.\n\nThe second term on the right-hand side is $\\frac{k_{des}}{v(r)}$:\n$$\\frac{k_{des}}{v(r)} = \\frac{k_{des}}{\\sqrt{2GM/r}} = \\frac{k_{des}}{\\sqrt{2GM}} r^{1/2}$$\nThe ordinary differential equation can now be written as:\n$$\\frac{dY_X}{dr} + \\frac{\\beta}{r} Y_X = \\frac{k_{des}}{\\sqrt{2GM}} r^{1/2}$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the differential equation**\n\nWe solve this ODE using the integrating factor method. The integrating factor $I(r)$ is:\n$$I(r) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{\\beta}{r} dr\\right) = \\exp(\\beta \\ln r) = r^{\\beta}$$\nMultiplying the ODE by $I(r)$:\n$$r^{\\beta} \\frac{dY_X}{dr} + \\beta r^{\\beta-1} Y_X = r^{\\beta} \\left( \\frac{k_{des}}{\\sqrt{2GM}} r^{1/2} \\right)$$\nThe left side is the derivative of a product:\n$$\\frac{d}{dr} (r^{\\beta} Y_X) = \\frac{k_{des}}{\\sqrt{2GM}} r^{\\beta + 1/2}$$\nWe integrate both sides with respect to $r$:\n$$r^{\\beta} Y_X(r) = \\int \\frac{k_{des}}{\\sqrt{2GM}} r'^{\\beta + 1/2} dr' = \\frac{k_{des}}{\\sqrt{2GM}} \\frac{r^{\\beta + 3/2}}{\\beta + 3/2} + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the integration constant.

From the governing equation, this implies:\n$$-Y_X(r_0) k_{acc}(r_0) + k_{des} = 0$$\nLetting $Y_X(r_0) = Y_{X,0}$, we have $Y_{X,0} = \\frac{k_{des}}{k_{acc}(r_0)} = \\frac{k_{des}}{K v_{th} \\rho(r_0)}$.\nWe need to relate $k_{des}$ to $Y_{X,0}$ and other parameters. First, find $\\rho(r_0)$:\n$$\\rho(r_0) = \\frac{\\dot{M}}{4\\pi r_0^2 v(r_0)} = \\frac{\\dot{M}}{4\\pi r_0^2 \\sqrt{2GM/r_0}} = \\frac{\\dot{M}}{4\\pi\\sqrt{2GM}} r_0^{-3/2}$$\nNow substitute this into the expression for $Y_{X,0}$:\n$$Y_{X,0} = \\frac{k_{des}}{K v_{th}} \\frac{1}{\\rho(r_0)} = \\frac{k_{des}}{K v_{th}} \\frac{4\\pi\\sqrt{2GM}}{\\dot{M}} r_0^{3/2}$$\nWe can rearrange a part of this expression to match the definition of $\\beta$:\n$$Y_{X,0} = \\frac{k_{des}}{\\sqrt{2GM}} \\left( \\frac{8\\pi GM}{K v_{th} \\dot{M}} \\right) \\frac{\\sqrt{2GM}\\sqrt{2GM}}{2 \\dot{M}} r_0^{3/2}$$\nA more direct route is to use $\\beta$:\n$$Y_{X,0} = \\frac{k_{des}}{K v_{th}} \\frac{4\\pi\\sqrt{2GM}}{\\dot{M}} r_0^{3/2} = \\left( \\frac{k_{des}}{\\sqrt{2GM}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{8\\pi G M}{K v_{th} \\dot{M}} \\right) \\frac{1}{2G M} \\frac{4\\pi (2GM)}{\\dot{M}} r_0^{3/2} = \\frac{k_{des}}{\\sqrt{2GM}} \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\frac{4\\pi\\sqrt{2GM}}{\\dot{M}} r_0^{3/2}$$\nLet's try a cleaner way.
