This exercise encourages you to think like a physicist uncovering a new law of nature. Instead of starting with a known force like gravity, you will work backward from a hypothetical but clear kinematic observation—a constant orbital speed regardless of the circular orbit's radius—to deduce the unique central force law that must be responsible. This practice strengthens your grasp of centripetal force and how orbital characteristics directly reveal the nature of the underlying interaction [@problem_id:247714].", "problem": "A particle of mass $m$ moves under the influence of a central force $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}) = F(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$. It is observed that for any arbitrary radius $r > 0$, there exists a stable circular orbit. Furthermore, the tangential speed of the particle in any of these circular orbits is a constant value, $v_0$, which is independent of the radius $r$.\n\nBased on these observations, derive the functional form of the force law, $F(r)$.

This problem invites you to explore a fascinating point of intersection between elliptical and circular motion. You will determine the exact location in an elliptical orbit where the orbiting body's speed momentarily equals the speed it would need to maintain a circular orbit at that same exact radius. Solving this reveals a beautifully simple and elegant relationship between the geometry of the orbit (its eccentricity) and this specific dynamic condition, deepening your intuition for the vis-viva equation [@problem_id:247985].", "problem": "A body of mass $m$ is in a stable, elliptical orbit around a much larger central mass $M$, such that $m \\ll M$.
