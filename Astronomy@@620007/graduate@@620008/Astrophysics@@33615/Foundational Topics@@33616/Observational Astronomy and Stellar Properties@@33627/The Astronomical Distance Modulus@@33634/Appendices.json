The method relies on the assumption that these events have a nearly uniform intrinsic peak luminosity, which corresponds to a well-defined absolute magnitude, $M_B$. This absolute magnitude is calibrated using a sample of nearby supernovae for which distances can be determined independently, often through the Hubble-Lemaître law, $d_L \\approx c z/H_0$, for low redshifts $z$. Here, $d_L$ is the luminosity distance, $c$ is the speed of light, and $H_0$ is the Hubble constant.\n\nThe calibrated value of $M_B$ is therefore dependent on the value of $H_0$ used in the calibration. Suppose that an initial calibration of $M_B$ is performed based on an assumed value $H_0$. Later, improved measurements suggest the Hubble constant is actually $H_0' = H_0 + \\Delta H_0$, where the change $\\Delta H_0$ is small compared to $H_0$. To maintain consistency with the observational data (i.e., the measured apparent magnitudes $m_B$ and redshifts $z$ of the calibrating supernovae), the value of the standard candle's absolute magnitude must be revised to $M_B' = M_B + \\Delta M_B$.\n\nThe relationship between apparent magnitude $m$, absolute magnitude $M$, and luminosity distance $d_L$ is given by the distance modulus equation $m - M = 5\\log_{10}(d_L / d_{\\text{ref}})$, where $d_{\\text{ref}}$ is a constant reference distance.\n\nDerive an expression for the required change in absolute magnitude, $\\Delta M_B$, as a linear function of the fractional change in the Hubble constant, $\\Delta H_0 / H_0$.", "solution": "1.

For Type Ia supernovae, used as \"standard candles,\" an accurate measurement of their peak apparent magnitude is crucial. This measurement, however, can be subject to subtle systematic biases arising from the statistical nature of photon counting.\n\nConsider the photometric measurement of a faint supernova at its peak brightness. An observation consists of measuring the number of photons, $N_{total}$, in an aperture centered on the supernova, and the number of photons, $N_{bkg}$, in an identical aperture placed on an adjacent patch of empty sky to measure the background. Both photon-counting processes are governed by Poisson statistics. The true mean number of photons from the supernova is $\\lambda_{sig}$, and the true mean number of photons from the sky background (within the aperture) is $\\lambda_{bkg}$. Thus, the observed counts are random variates drawn from Poisson distributions:\n- $N_{total} \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\lambda_{sig} + \\lambda_{bkg})$\n- $N_{bkg} \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\lambda_{bkg})$\n\nThe estimated signal from the supernova, in counts, is given by $S = N_{total} - N_{bkg}$. The apparent magnitude, $m$, is related to the signal counts via the relation $m = -k \\ln(\\text{signal}) + C$, where $k$ is a positive constant related to the base of the logarithm used, and $C$ is the magnitude zero-point. The \"true\" apparent magnitude is defined using the true mean signal: $m_{true} = -k \\ln(\\lambda_{sig}) + C$. An astronomer, however, must compute an estimated magnitude, $m_{est}$, from the single measurement $S$: $m_{est} = -k \\ln(S) + C$.\n\nDue to the non-linear nature of the logarithm, the expectation value of the estimated magnitude, $\\langle m_{est} \\rangle$, is not equal to the true magnitude, $m_{true}$. This discrepancy introduces a systematic bias into the measured magnitude and, consequently, the inferred distance modulus.\n\nDerive the leading-order expression for this systematic magnitude bias, $\\Delta m = \\langle m_{est} \\rangle - m_{true}$, in terms of the true mean counts $\\lambda_{sig}$, $\\lambda_{bkg}$, and the constant $k$.
