One such effect is atmospheric differential refraction, where the apparent position of a star shifts by an amount that depends on the wavelength of light. This can introduce errors in color index measurements, such as the standard B-V color index.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this phenomenon:\n1.  The apparent magnitude $m$ of a star is related to its measured flux $F$ by the Pogson equation, $m = -2.5 \\log_{10}(F) + C$, where $C$ is a constant. The B-V color index is defined as $B-V = m_B - m_V$, where $m_B$ and $m_V$ are the apparent magnitudes measured through B-band and V-band filters with effective central wavelengths $\\lambda_B$ and $\\lambda_V$ respectively, with $\\lambda_V > \\lambda_B$.\n2.
