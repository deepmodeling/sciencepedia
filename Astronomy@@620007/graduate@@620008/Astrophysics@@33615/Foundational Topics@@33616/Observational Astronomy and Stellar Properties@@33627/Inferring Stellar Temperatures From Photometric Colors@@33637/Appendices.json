This exercise explores a fundamental challenge in observational astronomy: how to best allocate a fixed amount of observing time between different filters to achieve the most precise measurement of a star's color.

The color is quantified by the $B-V$ color index, which is the difference between the star's apparent magnitude in the blue (B) and visual (V) filters: $B-V = m_B - m_V$. The apparent magnitude $m$ in any filter is related to the measured flux of the star, $F$, by the relation $m = -2.5 \\log_{10}(F) + \\text{constant}$.\n\nFor faint objects, the precision of a magnitude measurement is limited by photon statistics (shot noise). The error in a magnitude measurement, $\\sigma_m$, is related to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the photometric measurement by:\n$$\n\\sigma_m \\approx \\frac{2.5}{\\ln 10} \\frac{1}{\\text{SNR}}\n$$\nThis relation is valid for $\\text{SNR} \\gg 1$. The total uncertainty in the $B-V$ color, assuming independent measurements in the B and V filters, is given by $\\sigma_{B-V}^2 = \\sigma_{m_B}^2 + \\sigma_{m_V}^2$.\n\nThe signal is the number of photons collected from the star, $N_{star}$. The noise is dominated by the Poisson noise from both the star and a constant sky background. The number of photons detected from the sky background within the measurement aperture is $N_{sky}$. The total noise is the standard deviation of the total number of photons measured, $\\sigma_{total} = \\sqrt{N_{star} + N_{sky}}$. The signal-to-noise ratio is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{SNR} = \\frac{N_{star}}{\\sqrt{N_{star} + N_{sky}}}\n$$\nThe number of photons collected is the product of the photon detection rate and the exposure time, e.g., $N_{star} = R_S t$.\n\nAn astronomer has a total observing time $T_{tot}$ to dedicate to measuring the star's $B-V$ color. This time must be allocated between an exposure in the B-filter, with duration $t_B$, and an exposure in the V-filter, with duration $t_V$, such that $t_B + t_V = T_{tot}$. The constant, average photon detection rates from the star are $R_{S,B}$ and $R_{S,V}$ in the B and V filters, respectively. The corresponding constant rates from the sky background are $R_{sky,B}$ and $R_{sky,V}$.\n\nDerive the expression for the minimum possible photometric error, $\\sigma_{B-V}$, that can be achieved by optimally allocating the total exposure time $T_{tot}$ between the two filters.
