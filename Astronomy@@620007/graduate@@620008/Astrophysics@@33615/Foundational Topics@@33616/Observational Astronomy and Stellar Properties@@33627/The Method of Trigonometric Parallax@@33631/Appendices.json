The parallax angle $p$, measured in arcseconds, is related to the distance $d$, measured in parsecs, by the simple inverse relation $d=1/p$.\n\nA single measurement of a star's parallax is not perfectly accurate but is subject to random errors. Let the true parallax of a star be $p_0$, which corresponds to a true distance $d_0 = 1/p_0$. An observational measurement yields a value $p$, which can be described as a random variable.
