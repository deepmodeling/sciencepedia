The CW structure is obtained by taking the images of the open cells of the square.\n\nFirst, we determine the $0$-cells. The four vertices of the square are identified to a single point under the equivalence relations:\n$(0,0)\\sim(1,1)$ by $(0,y)\\sim(1,1-y)$ with $y=0$.\n$(1,1)\\sim(1,0)$ by $(x,0)\\sim(x,1)$ with $x=1$.\n$(1,0)\\sim(0,1)$ by $(0,y)\\sim(1,1-y)$ with $y=1$.\n$(0,1)\\sim(0,0)$ by $(x,0)\\sim(x,1)$ with $x=0$.\nHence there is exactly one $0$-cell, so $c_{0}(K)=1$.\n\nNext, we determine the $1$-cells. The open bottom and top edges are identified by $(x,0)\\sim(x,1)$, yielding one $1$-cell (call it the class of the horizontal edge). The open left and right edges are identified with reversed orientation by $(0,y)\\sim(1,1-y)$, yielding a second $1$-cell (the class of the vertical edge). Both of these attach to the unique $0$-cell. Thus $c_{1}(K)=2$.\n\nFinally, the interior of the square descends to a single open $2$-cell, attached along the boundary via the induced attaching map (its precise word is not needed for counting). Thus $c_{2}(K)=1$.\n\nAs a check, the Euler characteristic satisfies $\\chi(K)=c_{0}-c_{1}+c_{2}=1-2+1=0$, which is the known value for the Klein bottle.\n\nTherefore the Cellular Polynomial is\n$$\nP_{K}(t)=\\sum_{k=0}^{2}c_{k}(K)t^{k}=c_{0}t^{0}+c_{1}t^{1}+c_{2}t^{2}=1+2t+t^{2}.\n$$\nDifferentiate:\n$$\nP_{K}'(t)=\\frac{d}{dt}(1+2t+t^{2})=2+2t.\n$$\nEvaluate at $t=2$:\n$$\nP_{K}'(2)=2+2\\cdot 2=6.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "1667727"}, {"introduction": "Building on the ability to identify cells, this exercise explores the internal structure of a CW complex.

Indeed, $f(e^{1})$ contains the point $1$ because the nontrivial cube roots of unity lie in $e^{1}$ and map to $1$, but this does not violate cellularity. Injectivity is irrelevant to cellularity, so non-injectivity does not preclude cellularity. Not every continuous map between $1$-dimensional CW complexes is cellular, since one must preserve the $0$-skeleton. Finally, the induced map $f_{*}:\\pi_{1}(S^{1},1)\\to\\pi_{1}(S^{1},1)$ is multiplication by $3$, not the identity, but cellularity does not require the induced map on $\\pi_{1}$ to be the identity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1667743"}]}
