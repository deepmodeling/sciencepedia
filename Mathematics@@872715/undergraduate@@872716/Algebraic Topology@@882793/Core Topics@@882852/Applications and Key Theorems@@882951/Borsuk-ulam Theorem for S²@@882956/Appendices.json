This first exercise explores a common real-world mapping—latitude and longitude—to demonstrate why this condition is not a mere mathematical technicality.

We can define a function $f: S^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ that assigns a unique coordinate pair to each point $P$ on the surface. Let this a coordinate pair be $(l, \\lambda)$, where $l$ is the latitude and $\\lambda$ is the longitude. The latitude $l$ is defined to be in the range $[-90^\\circ, 90^\\circ]$, with $-90^\\circ$ at the South Pole and $90^\\circ$ at the North Pole. The longitude $\\lambda$ is defined to be in the range $[-180^\\circ, 180^\\circ)$, where negative values represent degrees west of the Prime Meridian and positive values represent degrees east. The longitude $180^\\circ$ is identified with the International Date Line.\n\nThe Borsuk-Ulam theorem, in the case of the 2-sphere, states: \"For any continuous function $g: S^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$, there exists at least one point $\\mathbf{x} \\in S^2$ such that $g(\\mathbf{x}) = g(-\\mathbf{x})$, where $-\\mathbf{x}$ is the point antipodal to $\\mathbf{x}$.\"\n\nApplying this theorem to the function $f(P) = (l, \\lambda)$ seems to suggest that there must be a pair of antipodal points on Earth that are assigned the exact same latitude and longitude coordinates. However, this conclusion is logically flawed.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly explains why the Borsuk-Ulam theorem cannot be directly applied to the latitude-longitude function $f$ as defined above?\n\nA. The function $f$ is not continuous because the longitude mapping has a discontinuity.\n\nB. The function $f$ is not continuous because the latitude mapping has a discontinuity at the poles.\n\nC. The target space of the function $f$ should be a compact space, but $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is not compact.\n\nD. The domain of the function, the Earth, is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid, which is not homeomorphic to $S^2$.", "solution": "We recall the hypothesis needed to invoke the Borsuk-Ulam theorem in the case of the 2-sphere: the map must be continuous, i.e., given $g: S^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ continuous, there exists $\\mathbf{x} \\in S^2$ with $g(\\mathbf{x}) = g(-\\mathbf{x})$. Therefore, to apply the theorem to the latitude-longitude mapping $f: S^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$, the function $f$ must be continuous.\n\nDefine $f(P) = (l(P), \\lambda(P))$, where $l$ is latitude in $[-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ and $\\lambda$ is longitude in $[-\\pi, \\pi)$. We show that $f$ is not continuous due to the longitude coordinate.\n\nFirst, the longitude coordinate has a jump discontinuity along the International Date Line (the meridian identified with both $\\lambda = -\\pi$ and $\\lambda = \\pi$). Fix a point $P_{0}$ on this meridian away from the poles. Consider two sequences of points approaching $P_{0}$ from opposite sides:\n- $P_{n}^{+}$ with longitudes $\\lambda(P_{n}^{+}) = \\pi - \\frac{1}{n}$ (approaching from the side with longitudes near $\\pi$),\n- $P_{n}^{-}$ with longitudes $\\lambda(P_{n}^{-}) = -\\pi + \\frac{1}{n}$ (approaching from the side with longitudes near $-\\pi$),\nand with latitudes $l(P_{n}^{\\pm}) \\to l(P_{0})$. Geometrically, $P_{n}^{+}$ and $P_{n}^{-}$ converge to the same point $P_{0}$ in $S^{2}$. However, the images satisfy\n$$\n\\lambda(P_{n}^{+}) \\to \\pi \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda(P_{n}^{-}) \\to -\\pi,\n$$\nand since the target interval is $[-\\pi, \\pi)$, the one-sided limits in the target differ by approximately $2\\pi$ even though the points in the domain converge to the same point. Hence the longitude coordinate is not continuous at $P_{0}$, and therefore $f$ is not continuous.\n\nSecond, at the poles the longitude is not well-defined geometrically (all longitudes meet at each pole). Any single-valued assignment $\\lambda(N)$ at the North Pole $N$ forces discontinuity: take a sequence approaching $N$ along a meridian with longitude $\\lambda(N) + \\pi$ (modulo $2\\pi$) and latitudes $l_{n} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{n}$. Then $P_{n} \\to N$ in $S^{2}$, but $\\lambda(P_{n})$ does not tend to $\\lambda(N)$ in $[-\\pi, \\pi)$; thus the longitude coordinate is discontinuous at the pole as well. In contrast, latitude $l$ is continuous on $S^{2}$, including at the poles.\n\nTherefore, the necessary continuity hypothesis for Borsuk-Ulam fails for $f$, specifically because the longitude mapping has a discontinuity (both at the date line and at the poles). This invalidates the direct application of the theorem. The other proposed reasons are incorrect: the latitude mapping is continuous, $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ need not be compact for Borsuk-Ulam, and $S^{2}$ models the Earth up to homeomorphism even if it is an oblate spheroid; moreover, the problem explicitly assumes a perfect sphere.\n\nThus the correct choice is the statement that the function $f$ is not continuous because the longitude mapping has a discontinuity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1634280"}, {"introduction": "While the theorem guarantees the existence of an antipodal pair with matching values, it doesn't tell us how to find them.
