A map $P: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is called a **polynomial map** if each of its component functions is a polynomial in the variables $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$. For instance, $P(x, y) = (x^2+y, y^3-2x)$ is a polynomial map from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nLet's recall some standard definitions.

Since $P$ is a polynomial map, it is continuous. The domain $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. By the Invariance of Domain theorem: if $U\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is open and $f:U\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is continuous and injective, then $f(U)$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $f:U\\to f(U)$ is a homeomorphism. Applying this with $U=\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ shows that $P(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ is open and $P$ is a homeomorphism onto its image. Therefore, A is true.\n\n- Statement B: If $P$ is a homeomorphism $\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $P^{-1}$ must also be a polynomial map. This is false in general. A counterexample in the case $n=1$ is $P(x)=x^{3}$, which is a polynomial homeomorphism of $\\mathbb{R}$ onto itself with inverse $P^{-1}(y)=y^{1/3}$, which is not a polynomial. Therefore, B is false.\n\n- Statement C: An injective polynomial map can only exist if each component has total degree exactly $1$. This is false. Again in $n=1$, $P(x)=x^{3}$ is injective and has degree $3$. In higher dimensions, $(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n})\\mapsto(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n-1},x_{n}^{3})$ is injective with a non-linear component. Therefore, C is false.\n\n- Statement D: The image of any non-constant polynomial map $P:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is always open. This is false without the injectivity hypothesis. For example, for $n=2$, $P(x,y)=(x,y^{2})$ is a polynomial map with image $P(\\mathbb{R}^{2})=\\{(u,v)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid v\\ge 0\\}=\\mathbb{R}\\times[0,\\infty)$, which is not open in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

This problem asks whether removing an open disk from the plane results in a space homeomorphic to the plane with a closed disk removed [@problem_id:2301582].

Which of the following statements provides a correct and sufficient reasoning to assess this claim?\n\nA. The claim is correct. Both spaces are path-connected and deformation retract to the unit circle $S^1$, so they have the same fundamental group. This is a sufficient condition for them to be homeomorphic.\n\nB. The claim is incorrect. The space $Y$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ while $X$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A homeomorphism cannot map a closed set to an open set.\n\nC. The claim is incorrect. If a homeomorphism $h: Y \\to X$ existed, then $X$ would be homeomorphic to $X \\setminus h(S^1)$. However, removing the compact set $h(S^1)$ from $X$ necessarily changes the fundamental group of the space, so $X$ cannot be homeomorphic to $X \\setminus h(S^1)$.\n\nD. The claim is correct. A homeomorphism $f: Y \\to X$ can be explicitly constructed by slightly pushing points in $Y$ away from the origin. For instance, in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, the map $f(r, \\theta) = (r+1, \\theta)$ is such a homeomorphism.\n\nE. The claim is incorrect. The space $Y$ contains a subset homeomorphic to a circle (the unit circle $S^1$), while the space $X$ does not contain any subset homeomorphic to a circle.", "solution": "We analyze whether $X=\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus \\bar{B}_{1}(0)=\\{(r,\\theta) \\mid r>1\\}$ and $Y=\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus B_{1}(0)=\\{(r,\\theta) \\mid r\\geq 1\\}$ are homeomorphic by evaluating each option’s reasoning.\n\nFirst, observe the basic relation $Y\\setminus S^{1}=X$, since removing the boundary circle $S^{1}$ from $Y$ (which already omits the open disk) exactly removes the remaining boundary, yielding the complement of the closed disk.\n\n- Option A is incorrect. Although both $X$ and $Y$ are homotopy equivalent to a circle (indeed, $Y$ deformation retracts onto $S^{1}$, and $X$ deformation retracts onto any circle $\\{r=R\\}$ with $R1$), having isomorphic fundamental groups is not a sufficient condition for homeomorphism. Moreover, $X$ does not deformation retract onto the specific unit circle $S^{1}$ because $S^{1}\\not\\subset X$.\n\n- Option B is incorrect. The properties “open in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$” and “closed in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$” are not intrinsic to the spaces $X$ and $Y$ as abstract topological spaces; they depend on the embedding into $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Homeomorphism between $X$ and $Y$ does not require preservation of openness/closedness in the ambient space.\n\n- Option D is incorrect. The proposed map in polar coordinates $f(r,\\theta)=(r+1,\\theta)$ sends $r\\geq 1$ to $r\\geq 2$, which is a proper subset of $X$ and hence not surjective; thus it is not a homeomorphism.\n\n- Option E is incorrect. The space $Y$ indeed contains a subset homeomorphic to $S^{1}$ (namely, $S^{1}$ itself), but $X$ also contains subsets homeomorphic to $S^{1}$, for example any circle $\\{r=R\\}$ with $R1$; therefore the stated distinction is false.\n\n- Option C gives the correct structural approach: assume a homeomorphism $h:Y\\to X$. Since $Y\\setminus S^{1}=X$, applying $h$ yields the identity $h(Y\\setminus S^{1})=h(Y)\\setminus h(S^{1})=X\\setminus h(S^{1})$. But $h(Y\\setminus S^{1})=h(X)$, and this set is equal to $X \\setminus h(S^1)$, so $X$ is homeomorphic (via the restriction of $h$) to $X \\setminus h(S^1)$. Now $h(S^{1})$ is a simple closed curve (homeomorphic to $S^{1}$) embedded in $X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. By the Jordan curve theorem, removing a simple closed curve from $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ disconnects the plane into exactly two components. Intersecting with $X$, one sees that $X\\setminus h(S^{1})$ has two connected components (e.g., for any circle in the annulus $X$, removing it splits $X$ into two annuli). Hence $X\\setminus h(S^{1})$ is disconnected, whereas $X$ is connected. Therefore $X$ cannot be homeomorphic to $X\\setminus h(S^{1})$, a contradiction. Consequently, no homeomorphism $h:Y\\to X$ exists. This reasoning is sufficient to conclude the claim is false.\n\nWhile the text of C mentions a change in fundamental group, the decisive invariant here is connectedness: $X$ is connected, but $X\\setminus h(S^{1})$ is not. The core implication “$X$ would be homeomorphic to $X\\setminus h(S^{1})$” leading to a contradiction is correct and sufficient to reject the claim.\n\nThus the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2301582"}, {"introduction": "This final practice problem explores a deep structural question about Euclidean space itself.
