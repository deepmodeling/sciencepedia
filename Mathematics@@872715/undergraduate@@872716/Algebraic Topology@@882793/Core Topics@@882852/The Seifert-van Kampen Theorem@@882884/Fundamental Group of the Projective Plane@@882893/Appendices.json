The space $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is obtained by identifying each point $(x,y)$ on the boundary of $S$ with its antipodal point $(-x,-y)$.

This function describes the path's coordinates inside the square. For the resulting path in $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ to be a continuous loop based at the center, the path described by $\\gamma$ must start at $C$, so $\\gamma(0)=C$, and end at a point whose image in $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is the same as the image of $C$. Furthermore, if the path $\\gamma(t)$ is discontinuous at some $t_0$, jumping from a point $P$ to a point $Q$, the resulting path in $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is continuous only if $P$ and $Q$ are identified in the quotient construction.\n\nSome loops in $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ are \"null-homotopic\", meaning they can be continuously shrunk to a single point.

There is a single jump at $t=\\frac{1}{2}$ from $(1,0)$ to $(-1,0)$, and $(1,0)\\sim(-1,0)$ since they are antipodal boundary points.

This path is contractible to a point within the disk.\n\nE. The path $\\alpha^2$ is not a closed loop, as the second journey starts at a point physically distinct from $P$ on the disk.", "solution": "Let's analyze the problem step by step using the disk model for the real projective plane, $\\mathbb{R}P^2$.\n\n1.  **The Space and the Base Point**: The space is a disk $D$ where for any point $x$ on the boundary circle $\\partial D$, it is identified with its antipodal point, $-x$. Let's place the disk in the Cartesian plane, centered at the origin $(0,0)$. We can set the base camp $P$ at the point $(1,0)$ on the boundary without loss of generality. The point antipodal to $P$ is $P_a = (-1,0)$. In $\\mathbb{R}P^2$, the points $P$ and $P_a$ are considered the same point due to the identification, so $[P] = [P_a]$.\n\n2.  **Path $\\alpha$**: The path $\\alpha$ starts at $P(1,0)$ and travels halfway around the boundary to $P_a(-1,0)$. We can represent this as the upper semicircle of the disk's boundary. Let's call the path representing one such journey $\\gamma_1$. $\\gamma_1$ starts at $P$ and ends at $P_a$. Since $[P]=[P_a]$ in $\\mathbb{R}P^2$, $\\gamma_1$ represents a closed loop based at the point $[P]$. This loop represents the generator, $g$, of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}P^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n3.  **Path $\\alpha^2$**: This path is the composition of the journey $\\alpha$ with itself. In group theory terms, this corresponds to the element $g^2$. In terms of paths, it is the concatenation of path $\\gamma_1$ with another path $\\gamma_2$ that also represents the journey $\\alpha$.\n    - The first journey, $\\gamma_1$, takes the explorer from $P$ to $P_a$ along the upper semicircle.\n    - The explorer is now at $P_a = (-1,0)$. The second journey, $\\gamma_2$, starts from this point. A journey of type $\\alpha$ involves traveling halfway around the boundary. Starting from $P_a$, traveling halfway around the boundary takes the explorer along the lower semicircle, ending back at the original point $P=(1,0)$.\n    - Therefore, the total path $\\alpha^2$ corresponds to traversing the upper semicircle and then the lower semicircle. This is equivalent to traversing the entire boundary circle of the disk, starting and ending at $P$.\n\n4.  **Contractibility of $\\alpha^2$**: The path for $\\alpha^2$ is the entire boundary circle $\\partial D$. We need to determine if this loop is contractible in $\\mathbb{R}P^2$. A loop is contractible (or null-homotopic) if it can be continuously shrunk to a single point.\n    - In the disk $D$, the boundary circle $\\partial D$ can be continuously shrunk to the center point $(0,0)$. We can define a homotopy $H(t, s) = (1-s) \\cdot \\text{point_on_circle}(t)$, where $s$ goes from $0$ to $1$. For $s=0$, we have the original circle. For $s=1$, all points are mapped to the origin $(0,0)$.\n    - This entire shrinking process takes place within the disk $D$. For any $s > 0$, the shrinking loop is in the interior of the disk, where no point identifications occur. The homotopy is well-defined and continuous in the quotient space $\\mathbb{R}P^2$. Therefore, the loop corresponding to the entire boundary circle is indeed contractible in $\\mathbb{R}P^2$. This reflects the algebraic fact that in $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}P^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$, the element $g^2$ is the identity element, which corresponds to the class of contractible loops.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    - A: Incorrect. The path $\\alpha^2$ is a different path from $\\alpha$ (the full circle vs. a semicircle). Also, it is contractible.\n    - B: The description of the path is correct, but the conclusion about contractibility is wrong. The intuition that a loop enclosing an area cannot be contracted is from Euclidean space and does not apply here due to the topological identifications of $\\mathbb{R}P^2$.\n    - C: The description of the path is incorrect. The path described is $\\alpha \\cdot \\alpha^{-1}$ (a path followed by its reverse), which is always contractible. The problem asks for $\\alpha^2 = \\alpha \\cdot \\alpha$.\n    - D: This option correctly identifies the path as the entire boundary circle and correctly states that it is contractible.\n    - E: Incorrect. While $P$ and $P_a$ are distinct points in the disk, they represent the same point in $\\mathbb{R}P^2$. This identification is what makes it possible to concatenate the two journeys to form a single closed loop.\n\nThus, statement D is the only accurate description.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1651013"}, {"introduction": "While drawing paths on models provides excellent intuition, a more formal and powerful way to study loops is by considering them as continuous maps from a circle, $S^1$.
