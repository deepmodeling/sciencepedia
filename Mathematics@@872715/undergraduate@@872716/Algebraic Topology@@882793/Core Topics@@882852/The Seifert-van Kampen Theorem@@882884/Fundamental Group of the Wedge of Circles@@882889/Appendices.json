In the free group $F_2$, the word $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ is reduced (no cancellations occur) and is not the identity, hence it represents a nontrivial element of $\\pi_1(X,x_0)$. Therefore, by the criterion above, $f$ does not extend to $D^2$.\n\nAddressing the options:\n- A is false: although the commutator maps to zero in $H_1(X)$ (since $H_1$ is the abelianization), extendability depends on the triviality in $\\pi_1$, not merely in $H_1$.\n- B is false: there is no general dimensional argument guaranteeing such extensions.\n- C is correct: $f$ corresponds to a nontrivial element of $\\pi_1(X)$, so no extension exists.\n- D is false: non-simply connectedness does not prohibit continuous maps from $D^2$, and the failure here is specifically due to nontriviality in $\\pi_1$.\n- E is false: the homotopy class (commutator) suffices to decide extendability.\n\nThus, the correct statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1651593"}, {"introduction": "Having seen that the fundamental group detects \"holes\" in a space, a natural question is whether we can surgically modify a space to alter its fundamental group.
