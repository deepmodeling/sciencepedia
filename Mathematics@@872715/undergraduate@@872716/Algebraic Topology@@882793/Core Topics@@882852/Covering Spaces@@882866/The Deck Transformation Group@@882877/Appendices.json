This first exercise provides a simple 2-sheeted covering of the figure-eight space, $S^1 \\vee S^1$.

Each loop begins and ends at $v_0$. Topologically, this space is equivalent to $S^1 \\vee S^1$.\n\nNow, let's construct another space, $\\tilde{X}$, from two distinct vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$. The space $\\tilde{X}$ is formed by attaching the following four oriented paths:\n- A path $a_1$ that starts at $v_1$ and ends at $v_2$.\n- A path $a_2$ that starts at $v_2$ and ends at $v_1$.\n- A loop $b_1$ that starts and ends at $v_1$.\n- A loop $b_2$ that starts and ends at $v_2$.\n\nA continuous map $p: \\tilde{X} \\to X$ is defined that makes $(\\tilde{X}, p)$ a 2-sheeted covering space for $X$. The map is defined on the vertices and paths as follows:\n- On vertices: $p(v_1) = v_0$ and $p(v_2) = v_0$.\n- On paths: The map $p$ sends the paths $a_1$ and $a_2$ to the loop $a$, preserving orientation.

In a connected $2$-sheeted covering, the non-trivial deck transformation swaps the two sheets, hence it must swap the points in each fiber of $p$. In particular, since $p(v_1)=v_0=p(v_2)$, the non-trivial $\\tau$ must satisfy $\\tau(v_1)=v_2$ and $\\tau(v_2)=v_1$.\n\nNext, we determine the action on edges by the condition $p\\circ\\tau=p$ and by local lifting uniqueness. At a vertex $w\\in\\{v_1,v_2\\}$, each oriented edge $e$ incident at $w$ is mapped by $p$ to a specific oriented loop in $X$. The image $\\tau(e)$ must be an oriented edge incident at $\\tau(w)$ that maps by $p$ to the same oriented loop, because $p(\\tau(e))=(p\\circ\\tau)(e)=p(e)$.\n\nApply this to 'a'-edges. The path $a_1$ is the unique lift of the oriented loop $a$ that starts at $v_1$ and ends at $v_2$. Since $\\tau(v_1)=v_2$ and $p(\\tau(a_1))=p(a_1)=a$ with preserved orientation, $\\tau(a_1)$ must be the unique lift of $a$ that starts at $v_2$, namely $a_2$. Symmetrically, $\\tau(a_2)=a_1$.\n\nApply this to 'b'-loops. The loop $b_1$ at $v_1$ maps to $b$ preserving orientation. After applying $\\tau$, the basepoint goes to $v_2$, and we still must have $p(\\tau(b_1))=b$ preserving orientation. The only such loop based at $v_2$ is $b_2$, so $\\tau(b_1)=b_2$. Similarly, $\\tau(b_2)=b_1$.\n\nTherefore the non-trivial deck transformation swaps $v_1\\leftrightarrow v_2$, swaps $a_1\\leftrightarrow a_2$, and swaps $b_1\\leftrightarrow b_2$. This is exactly option C. The other options fail: A fixes vertices, contradicting sheet-swapping for the unique non-trivial element; B reverses orientation on $a$ so $p\\circ\\tau$ would send 'a'-edges to $a^{-1}\\neq a$; D is incompatible with endpoint mapping since $\\tau(v_1)=v_2$ but $\\tau(b_1)=b_1$ would keep the loop based at $v_1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1679736"}, {"introduction": "A common introductory example might lead one to believe that for an $n$-sheeted covering, the deck transformation group always has $n$ elements.

A deck transformation is a graph automorphism that preserves the labels of the edges. For a connected covering, a deck transformation is uniquely determined by its action on a single vertex.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThe number of vertices is 6, so this is a 6-sheeted covering. This satisfies the \"not 2-sheeted\" condition.\nLet's find the deck transformation group $G(\\tilde{X}_A)$. Consider the permutation of vertices $\\phi = (v_1 v_2)(v_3 v_4)(v_5 v_6)$. We check if it is a deck transformation.\n- For 'a' edges: The edge $(v_1, v_3)$ is mapped to $(\\phi(v_1), \\phi(v_3)) = (v_2, v_4)$, which is in $E_a$. The edge $(v_3, v_5)$ maps to $(\\phi(v_3), \\phi(v_5)) = (v_4, v_6)$, which is in $E_a$. The edge $(v_5, v_1)$ maps to $(\\phi(v_5), \\phi(v_1)) = (v_6, v_2)$, which is in $E_a$. The other 'a' edges are images of these under $\\phi$, so they are also preserved.\n- For 'b' edges: The edge $(v_1, v_2)$ is mapped to $(\\phi(v_1), \\phi(v_2)) = (v_2, v_1)$, which is in $E_b$. The edge $(v_2, v_1)$ is mapped to $(v_1, v_2)$, also in $E_b$. The loop $(v_3, v_3)$ maps to $(\\phi(v_3), \\phi(v_3)) = (v_4, v_4)$, which is in $E_b$. Similarly, the loop at $v_4$ maps to the loop at $v_3$, and loops at $v_5, v_6$ are swapped.\nThus, $\\phi$ is a deck transformation. Since $\\phi^2$ is the identity, the group $G(\\tilde{X}_A)$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nNow we must check if there are other non-identity deck transformations. Let $\\psi$ be any deck transformation. The set of edges labeled 'b' consists of a pair of edges between $v_1$ and $v_2$, and loops at the other four vertices. An automorphism must preserve the structure of this 'b'-subgraph. The vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the only ones with degree 2 in this subgraph (counting each directed edge), while $v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6$ have degree 2 via a loop. More simply, $v_1, v_2$ have non-loop 'b' edges, while the others only have loops. Therefore, any deck transformation must map the set $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ to itself.\nSo, for any $\\psi \\in G(\\tilde{X}_A)$, we must have $\\psi(v_1) \\in \\{v_1, v_2\\}$.\n- Case 1: $\\psi(v_1) = v_1$. Since there is an 'a' edge from $v_1$ to $v_3$, $\\psi$ must map it to an 'a' edge from $\\psi(v_1)=v_1$ to $\\psi(v_3)$. The unique outgoing 'a' edge from $v_1$ is to $v_3$, so $\\psi(v_3)=v_3$. Similarly, from $(v_3, v_5) \\in E_a$, we deduce $\\psi(v_5)=v_5$. Following the 'b' edge $(v_1,v_2)$, we must have $\\psi(v_2)=v_2$. Since $\\psi$ fixes $\\{v_1,v_3,v_5\\}$ and $v_2$, it must also fix their partners $\\{v_2,v_4,v_6\\}$ under the 'a' cycles. Thus, $\\psi$ fixes all vertices, so $\\psi$ is the identity.\n- Case 2: $\\psi(v_1) = v_2$. Since there is a 'b' edge from $v_1$ to $v_2$, $\\psi$ must map it to a 'b' edge from $\\psi(v_1)=v_2$ to $\\psi(v_2)$. The unique outgoing 'b' edge from $v_2$ is to $v_1$, so $\\psi(v_2)=v_1$. So $\\psi$ must swap $v_1$ and $v_2$. Now following the 'a' edge $(v_1,v_3)$, $\\psi$ must map it to an 'a' edge from $\\psi(v_1)=v_2$ to $\\psi(v_3)$. The unique 'a' edge from $v_2$ is to $v_4$, so $\\psi(v_3)=v_4$. Continuing this logic, we find $\\psi = (v_1 v_2)(v_3 v_4)(v_5 v_6) = \\phi$.\nThe only deck transformations are the identity and $\\phi$. Therefore, $G(\\tilde{X}_A) = \\{id, \\phi\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Option A satisfies all conditions.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis is a 2-sheeted covering. The problem asks for a covering that is *not* 2-sheeted. Thus, this option is incorrect. (For completeness, its deck transformation group is indeed $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, generated by the vertex-swapping map $\\phi=(v_1 v_2)$).\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis is a 4-sheeted covering, so it is not 2-sheeted. Let's find its deck group. The graph is highly symmetric.\nLet $\\phi = (v_1 v_2)(v_3 v_4)$. Let's check the 'b' edge $(v_1, v_4)$. It maps to $(\\phi(v_1), \\phi(v_4)) = (v_2, v_3)$, which is in $E_b$. All other edges can be checked similarly, showing $\\phi$ is a deck transformation.\nLet $\\psi = (v_1 v_3)(v_2 v_4)$. Let's check the 'b' edge $(v_1, v_4)$. It maps to $(\\psi(v_1), \\psi(v_4)) = (v_3, v_2)$, which is in $E_b$. So $\\psi$ is also a deck transformation.\nThe deck group $G(\\tilde{X}_C)$ contains at least $\\{id, \\phi, \\psi, \\phi\\psi\\}$. Since $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are commuting involutions, this group is $\\{id, (v_1 v_2)(v_3 v_4), (v_1 v_3)(v_2 v_4), (v_1 v_4)(v_2 v_3)\\}$, which is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This is not $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis is a 3-sheeted covering, so it is not 2-sheeted. Let's find its deck group.\nLet $\\psi$ be any deck transformation. The 'b' edges are loops at each vertex. So for any vertex $v_i$, the edge $(v_i, v_i)$ must map to an edge $(\\psi(v_i), \\psi(v_i))$. This means $\\psi$ must take a vertex with a 'b' loop to another vertex with a 'b' loop. Since all vertices have 'b' loops, this gives no constraint.\nHowever, consider the 'a' edges. They form a single 3-cycle $v_1 \\to v_2 \\to v_3 \\to v_1$. An automorphism must preserve this cycle structure. This means the group of automorphisms must be a subgroup of the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ generated by $\\rho = (v_1 v_2 v_3)$. But we must also preserve the 'b' edge labels. The 'b' edges are loops at each vertex. The map $\\rho$ sends the loop $(v_1, v_1)$ to $(\\rho(v_1), \\rho(v_1))=(v_2,v_2)$, which is a valid 'b' edge. So $\\rho$ is a deck transformation. The deck group is $\\{id, \\rho, \\rho^2\\}$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. This is not $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nConclusion: Only option A describes a covering space that is not 2-sheeted (it is 6-sheeted) and has a deck transformation group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1679756"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise reveals the deep and powerful connection between the deck transformation group and the fundamental group of the base space.
