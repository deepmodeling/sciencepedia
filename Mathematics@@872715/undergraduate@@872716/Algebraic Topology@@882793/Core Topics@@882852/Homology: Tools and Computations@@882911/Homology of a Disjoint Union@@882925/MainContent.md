## Introduction
In algebraic topology, we study properties of spaces that are invariant under [continuous deformation](@entry_id:151691). A fundamental question arises when dealing with spaces composed of multiple, separate pieces: how do the algebraic invariants of the whole space relate to those of its parts? Specifically, for a space formed by the disjoint union of several components, a core challenge is to develop a systematic way to compute its homology groups without treating the entire complex space as a monolithic entity. This article addresses this gap by focusing on one of the most elegant and powerful principles in homology theory.

This article will guide you through the theory and application of the homology of a disjoint union. The first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," establishes the main theorem—that homology is additive over disjoint unions—and delves into the chain-level proof that underpins this result. Next, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" demonstrates how this principle serves as a powerful computational tool and explores its connections to fields like differential geometry. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" provides targeted exercises to ensure a practical command of this foundational tool in topology.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the study of algebraic topology, one of the most fundamental operations on [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056) is the disjoint union. Understanding how homology behaves with respect to this operation provides not only a powerful computational tool but also deep insight into the structure of the homology theory itself. This chapter elucidates the core principle that homology is additive over disjoint unions, explores the chain-level mechanism responsible for this property, and examines its consequences and generalizations.

### The Additivity of Homology for Disjoint Unions

The primary principle governing the homology of a disjoint union is remarkably simple and elegant. If a [topological space](@entry_id:149165) $X$ is formed by the disjoint union of two other spaces, $A$ and $B$, denoted $X = A \sqcup B$, then the homology groups of $X$ are simply the [direct sum](@entry_id:156782) of the homology groups of its constituent parts.

**Theorem (Additivity of Homology):** Let $A$ and $B$ be any two topological spaces. For any integer $n \ge 0$ and any coefficient group $G$, there is a [natural isomorphism](@entry_id:276379):
$$
H_n(A \sqcup B; G) \cong H_n(A; G) \oplus H_n(B; G)
$$
This theorem states that, from the perspective of homology, the space $A \sqcup B$ is algebraically equivalent to having the spaces $A$ and $B$ side-by-side, with no interaction between them. The [direct sum](@entry_id:156782) $\oplus$ is the appropriate algebraic construction for capturing this idea of non-interacting components. The principle extends naturally to a disjoint union of any collection of spaces $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$:
$$
H_n\left(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_i; G\right) \cong \bigoplus_{i \in I} H_n(X_i; G)
$$

### The Underlying Mechanism: Decomposition at the Chain Level

To understand why the additivity theorem holds, we must look at the construction of [singular homology](@entry_id:158380) itself, beginning with the singular [chain complex](@entry_id:150246). Recall that the $n$-th singular chain group of a space $Z$, denoted $C_n(Z)$, is the free [abelian group](@entry_id:139381) generated by all [continuous maps](@entry_id:153855) $\sigma: \Delta^n \to Z$, where $\Delta^n$ is the standard $n$-[simplex](@entry_id:270623).

The key topological fact that drives our result is that the standard $n$-[simplex](@entry_id:270623) $\Delta^n$ is a **path-connected** space for all $n \ge 0$. In the disjoint union $X = A \sqcup B$, the subspaces $A$ and $B$ are both open and closed (clopen). Since the continuous image of a [connected space](@entry_id:153144) is connected, the image of any [singular simplex](@entry_id:265569) $\sigma: \Delta^n \to A \sqcup B$ must lie entirely within $A$ or entirely within $B$. A simplex cannot have one part of its image in $A$ and another in $B$.

This observation has a profound algebraic consequence: the set of generators for the chain group $C_n(A \sqcup B)$ is the disjoint union of the set of generators for $C_n(A)$ and the set of generators for $C_n(B)$. This leads to a [natural isomorphism](@entry_id:276379) of free abelian groups [@problem_id:1654668]:
$$
C_n(A \sqcup B) \cong C_n(A) \oplus C_n(B)
$$
An element of $C_n(A \sqcup B)$, which is a formal sum of singular $n$-simplices in $A \sqcup B$, can be uniquely written as a pair $(c_A, c_B)$, where $c_A$ is a chain in $A$ and $c_B$ is a chain in $B$.

The next step is to examine the [boundary operator](@entry_id:160216), $\partial_n: C_n(Z) \to C_{n-1}(Z)$. The boundary of a [simplex](@entry_id:270623) in $A$ is a chain of [simplices](@entry_id:264881) also contained in $A$. Likewise, the boundary of a simplex in $B$ is a chain in $B$. Therefore, the [boundary operator](@entry_id:160216) on $C_n(A \sqcup B)$ respects the [direct sum decomposition](@entry_id:263004). If we represent a chain $c \in C_n(A \sqcup B)$ as $(c_A, c_B)$, then its boundary is:
$$
\partial_n^{A \sqcup B}(c_A, c_B) = (\partial_n^A(c_A), \partial_n^B(c_B))
$$
In the language of [homological algebra](@entry_id:155139), this means the singular [chain complex](@entry_id:150246) of the disjoint union is the direct sum of the individual chain complexes:
$$
C_*(A \sqcup B) \cong C_*(A) \oplus C_*(B)
$$
Homology is a [functor](@entry_id:260898) that "commutes" with direct sums. That is, the homology of a [direct sum](@entry_id:156782) of chain complexes is the direct sum of their respective homology groups. The cycles (the kernel of $\partial_n$) split, $Z_n(A \sqcup B) \cong Z_n(A) \oplus Z_n(B)$, and the boundaries (the image of $\partial_{n+1}$) also split, $B_n(A \sqcup B) \cong B_n(A) \oplus B_n(B)$. Taking the quotient gives the desired result for every dimension $n$:
$$
H_n(A \sqcup B) = \frac{Z_n(A \sqcup B)}{B_n(A \sqcup B)} \cong \frac{Z_n(A) \oplus Z_n(B)}{B_n(A) \oplus B_n(B)} \cong \frac{Z_n(A)}{B_n(A)} \oplus \frac{Z_n(B)}{B_n(B)} = H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B)
$$

### The Zeroth Homology Group: A Geometric Interpretation

The additivity principle is particularly intuitive in dimension zero. For any topological space $Z$, the [zeroth homology group](@entry_id:261808) $H_0(Z; \mathbb{Z})$ is known to be a free [abelian group](@entry_id:139381) whose rank is equal to the number of [path-connected components](@entry_id:275432) of $Z$. If $Z$ has $k$ [path-components](@entry_id:145705), $H_0(Z; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}^k$.

Let's apply this to a disjoint union. Suppose $X$ is a space with $k_X$ [path-components](@entry_id:145705) and $Y$ is a space with $k_Y$ [path-components](@entry_id:145705). The disjoint union $X \sqcup Y$ will have exactly $k_X + k_Y$ [path-components](@entry_id:145705). Geometrically, we expect its [zeroth homology group](@entry_id:261808) to be $\mathbb{Z}^{k_X+k_Y}$. Our additivity theorem confirms this algebraically:
$$
H_0(X \sqcup Y) \cong H_0(X) \oplus H_0(Y) \cong \mathbb{Z}^{k_X} \oplus \mathbb{Z}^{k_Y} \cong \mathbb{Z}^{k_X+k_Y}
$$
For instance, if we construct a space by taking the disjoint union of three circles and two closed line segments, we are combining 5 [path-connected components](@entry_id:275432) in total. The [zeroth homology group](@entry_id:261808) of this space is therefore $\mathbb{Z}^5$ [@problem_id:1654672]. Similarly, the rank of the [zeroth homology group](@entry_id:261808) of a space formed by the disjoint union of a 2-sphere, a solid torus, a real projective plane, and a point is 4, as there are four [path-connected components](@entry_id:275432) [@problem_id:1654654].

### Computational Power: Betti Numbers and Euler Characteristic

The additivity theorem is a cornerstone of many homological computations. One of its most direct applications is in the calculation of **Betti numbers**. The $n$-th Betti number of a space $Z$, denoted $b_n(Z)$, is the rank of its $n$-th homology group with integer coefficients, $b_n(Z) = \text{rank}(H_n(Z; \mathbb{Z}))$. Since the rank of a direct sum of [abelian groups](@entry_id:145145) is the sum of their ranks, we immediately have:
$$
b_n(X \sqcup Y) = b_n(X) + b_n(Y)
$$
This allows us to compute the Betti numbers of a complex, [disconnected space](@entry_id:155520) by simply summing the Betti numbers of its individual components.

Consider, for example, a space $M$ constructed as the disjoint union of two 2-spheres ($S^2$), three real projective planes ($\mathbb{R}P^2$), one Klein bottle ($K$), four circles ($S^1$), and one 3-torus ($T^3$) [@problem_id:1654662]. To find the Betti numbers of $M$, we first tabulate the Betti numbers of its components:
- $S^2$: $b_0=1, b_2=1$.
- $\mathbb{R}P^2$: $b_0=1$. (Note $H_1(\mathbb{R}P^2; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$, a [torsion group](@entry_id:144787), so its rank $b_1$ is 0).
- $K$: $b_0=1, b_1=1$. (Note $H_1(K; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_2$, so its rank $b_1$ is 1).
- $S^1$: $b_0=1, b_1=1$.
- $T^3$: $b_0=1, b_1=3, b_2=3, b_3=1$.

We can now calculate the Betti numbers of $M$ by summing the contributions from all 11 components:
- $b_0(M) = 2(1) + 3(1) + 1(1) + 4(1) + 1(1) = 11$, correctly counting the number of [path-components](@entry_id:145705).
- $b_1(M) = 2(0) + 3(0) + 1(1) + 4(1) + 1(3) = 8$.
- $b_2(M) = 2(1) + 3(0) + 1(0) + 4(0) + 1(3) = 5$.
- $b_3(M) = 2(0) + 3(0) + 1(0) + 4(0) + 1(1) = 1$.

This demonstrates the power of the theorem in breaking down a seemingly complex problem into manageable parts.

### Functoriality: The Effect of Maps on Homology

Homology is a functor, meaning it assigns not only a group to each space but also a homomorphism to each [continuous map](@entry_id:153772). The additivity principle interacts predictably with maps to and from a disjoint union.

Consider the natural inclusion map $i_A: A \hookrightarrow A \sqcup B$. This map induces a homomorphism on homology, $i_{A*}: H_n(A) \to H_n(A \sqcup B)$. Under the [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127) $H_n(A \sqcup B) \cong H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B)$, what form does this [induced map](@entry_id:271712) take? A cycle in $A$ is, by inclusion, a cycle in $A \sqcup B$. On the chain level, the inclusion map $i_{A\#}: C_n(A) \to C_n(A) \oplus C_n(B)$ sends a chain $c_A$ to the pair $(c_A, 0)$. This structure carries over to homology, so the [induced map](@entry_id:271712) is the inclusion into the first [direct summand](@entry_id:150541):
$$
i_{A*}: [c] \mapsto ([c], 0)
$$
This immediately implies that $i_{A*}$ is always **injective**. An alternative way to see this is to construct a continuous map $r: A \sqcup B \to A$ that "retracts" the disjoint union onto $A$. One can define $r$ as the identity on $A$ and as a constant map on $B$ (sending all of $B$ to a single point in $A$). Then the composition $r \circ i_A$ is the identity map on $A$. By [functoriality](@entry_id:150069), $(r \circ i_A)_* = r_* \circ i_{A*} = \text{id}_{H_n(A)}$, which shows $i_{A*}$ has a left inverse and must be injective. However, $i_{A*}$ is not surjective unless $H_n(B)$ is the trivial group, because its image is only the $H_n(A)$ summand [@problem_id:1654647].

Now consider maps from a disjoint union. Let $W = X \sqcup Y$. Any map $f: W \to Z$ is determined by its restrictions $f|_X: X \to Z$ and $f|_Y: Y \to Z$. The [induced map on homology](@entry_id:265781) $f_*: H_n(X) \oplus H_n(Y) \to H_n(Z)$ is given by $f_*([c_X], [c_Y]) = (f|_X)_*([c_X]) + (f|_Y)_*([c_Y])$.

Let's illustrate with an example [@problem_id:1654686]. Let $W = S^1 \sqcup T^2$. We know $H_1(W) \cong H_1(S^1) \oplus H_1(T^2) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus (\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}^3$. An element can be written $(k, l, m)$.
- Consider a map $p: W \to S^1$ which is the identity on the $S^1$ component and crushes the $T^2$ component to a point. Then $(p|_{S^1})_*$ is the identity on $H_1(S^1)$, while $(p|_{T^2})_*$ is the zero map since constant maps induce zero maps on $H_n$ for $n > 0$. The [induced map](@entry_id:271712) is $p_*(k, l, m) = k$. This map acts as the projection onto the first factor of the [direct sum](@entry_id:156782).
- Now consider a different map $q: W \to S^1$. Let $q$ be the identity on $S^1$, but on $T^2 = S^1 \times S^1$, let it be the projection onto the first factor circle. The [induced map](@entry_id:271712) $(q|_{T^2})_*: H_1(T^2) \to H_1(S^1)$ sends a class $(l, m)$ to $l$. Thus, the full [induced map](@entry_id:271712) is $q_*(k, l, m) = k + l$. This shows how different parts of the domain can contribute to the final homology class in the target space.

### Generalizations of the Additivity Principle

The fundamental idea of additivity extends to other forms of homology and can be viewed from different theoretical perspectives.

#### Reduced Homology

Reduced homology, $\tilde{H}_n(Z)$, is a slight modification of ordinary homology, differing only in dimension 0. For any non-empty space $Z$, $H_0(Z) \cong \tilde{H}_0(Z) \oplus \mathbb{Z}$. For $n \ge 1$, $\tilde{H}_n(Z) = H_n(Z)$.

How does [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) behave with respect to disjoint unions?
- For $n \ge 1$: Since reduced and ordinary homology groups are identical, the additivity holds directly: $\tilde{H}_n(A \sqcup B) \cong \tilde{H}_n(A) \oplus \tilde{H}_n(B)$.
- For $n = 0$: The situation is more subtle. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are non-empty and path-connected. Then $H_0(A) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ and $H_0(B) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, which implies $\tilde{H}_0(A) = 0$ and $\tilde{H}_0(B) = 0$. However, $A \sqcup B$ has two [path-components](@entry_id:145705), so $H_0(A \sqcup B) \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$. From the relation $H_0(A \sqcup B) \cong \tilde{H}_0(A \sqcup B) \oplus \mathbb{Z}$, we deduce that $\tilde{H}_0(A \sqcup B) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ [@problem_id:1654681].

More generally, for a disjoint union of $k$ non-empty [path-connected spaces](@entry_id:152443) $X_1 \sqcup \dots \sqcup X_k$, the reduced [zeroth homology](@entry_id:269016) is $\tilde{H}_0(\sqcup X_i) \cong \mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$. The additivity for reduced Betti numbers $\tilde{\beta}_n$ is thus $\tilde{\beta}_n(\sqcup X_i) = \sum \tilde{\beta}_n(X_i)$ for $n \ge 1$, but $\tilde{\beta}_0(\sqcup X_i) = (\sum (\tilde{\beta}_0(X_i)+1)) - 1 = k-1$ if each $X_i$ is path-connected. This modified formula must be used when calculating quantities like the reduced Euler characteristic $\tilde{\chi}(X) = \sum (-1)^n \tilde{\beta}_n(X)$ [@problem_id:1654691].

#### Relative Homology

The additivity principle extends to [relative homology](@entry_id:159348) as well. For a pair of spaces $(X, A)$, the [relative homology groups](@entry_id:159711) $H_n(X, A)$ are defined. If we have two pairs, $(X, A)$ and $(Y, B)$, we can form their disjoint union $(X \sqcup Y, A \sqcup B)$. The [relative homology groups](@entry_id:159711) are additive:
$$
H_n(X \sqcup Y, A \sqcup B) \cong H_n(X, A) \oplus H_n(Y, B)
$$
The proof follows the same logic as for absolute homology: the relative [chain complex](@entry_id:150246) $C_*(X \sqcup Y, A \sqcup B)$ can be shown to be isomorphic to the [direct sum](@entry_id:156782) of the relative chain complexes $C_*(X, A) \oplus C_*(Y, B)$. This allows for the computation of [relative homology groups](@entry_id:159711) of disconnected pairs by analyzing each pair separately [@problem_id:1654698].

#### The Mayer-Vietoris Perspective

An alternative and powerful way to derive the additivity of homology is through the **Mayer-Vietoris sequence**. This sequence relates the homology of a space $X$ to the homology of two subspaces $A$ and $B$ that cover it, i.e., $X = A \cup B$. If $A$ and $B$ are open sets, the sequence is:
$$
\dots \to H_n(A \cap B) \to H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B) \to H_n(X) \to H_{n-1}(A \cap B) \to \dots
$$
Now, consider the special case where $X$ is a disjoint union $X = A \sqcup B$. Topologically, this means we can choose $A$ and $B$ to be [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704) whose union is $X$. In this scenario, the intersection $A \cap B$ is the empty set, $\emptyset$.

The homology of the empty set is trivial in all dimensions: $H_n(\emptyset) = 0$ for all $n$. Substituting this into the Mayer-Vietoris sequence gives:
$$
\dots \to 0 \to H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B) \to H_n(X) \to 0 \to \dots
$$
For this sequence to be exact at every position, the map from $H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B)$ to $H_n(X)$ must be an isomorphism for every $n$. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence becomes "degenerate" and breaks apart into a collection of short [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) that simply state the [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127) $H_n(X) \cong H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B)$ [@problem_id:1654645]. This provides a satisfying confirmation of our main principle from one of the fundamental axiomatic tools of homology theory.
