## Introduction
Singular homology is a cornerstone of algebraic topology, translating complex geometric questions into the manageable language of algebra. However, the standard theory has a notable quirk: the simplest non-empty space, a single point, possesses non-trivial [zeroth homology](@entry_id:269016). This seemingly minor detail complicates the statements of fundamental results for contractible spaces and can obscure the intuitive meaning of connectivity. To address this, topologists developed [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187), an elegant and powerful modification that refines the standard framework.

This article provides a comprehensive introduction to [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) groups. In "Principles and Mechanisms," we will construct the augmented [chain complex](@entry_id:150246) to define [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) and establish its precise relationship with the standard homology groups. Next, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate how this refined theory simplifies essential theorems, enhances computational techniques like the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, and illuminates connections to suspension, manifolds, and homotopy theory. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will guide you through concrete examples, solidifying your understanding of how to apply these concepts to analyze [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056). By the end, you will see how this small change in definition leads to a cleaner, more powerful perspective on the algebraic structure of space.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the study of [singular homology](@entry_id:158380), we find that the homology groups of a single-point space, $\{p\}$, are $H_0(\{p\}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ and $H_n(\{p\}) = 0$ for $n > 0$. While this is a direct consequence of the definitions, it can be notationally and conceptually cumbersome. The simplest possible non-empty space possesses non-[trivial homology](@entry_id:265875), which complicates the statements of certain fundamental theorems, such as those concerning contractible spaces or the [suspension isomorphism](@entry_id:156388). Reduced homology provides an elegant modification to the standard theory, designed specifically to ensure that a point—and by extension, any contractible space—is homologically trivial in all dimensions. This refinement simplifies the algebraic landscape of topology and clarifies the geometric meaning of the [zeroth homology group](@entry_id:261808).

### The Augmented Chain Complex and Definition of Reduced Homology

The standard singular [chain complex](@entry_id:150246) for a topological space $X$ with integer coefficients is given by:
$$ \dots \xrightarrow{\partial_{n+1}} C_n(X) \xrightarrow{\partial_n} C_{n-1}(X) \xrightarrow{} \dots \xrightarrow{\partial_1} C_0(X) \to 0 $$
where $C_n(X)$ is the free abelian group on the set of singular $n$-simplices in $X$. The key idea behind [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) is to "augment" this complex at the very end.

We define an **[augmentation map](@entry_id:272732)** $\epsilon: C_0(X) \to \mathbb{Z}$ as the unique homomorphism that sends every singular 0-[simplex](@entry_id:270623) (which is simply a point in $X$) to the integer $1$. For a general 0-chain $c = \sum_{i} k_i \sigma_i$, where $\sigma_i$ are 0-simplices and $k_i \in \mathbb{Z}$, the map is given by $\epsilon(c) = \sum_{i} k_i$. In essence, it sums the coefficients.

A crucial property of this map is that the image of the [boundary operator](@entry_id:160216) $\partial_1$ lies in its kernel. For any 1-[simplex](@entry_id:270623) $\sigma: \Delta^1 \to X$, its boundary is $\partial_1(\sigma) = \sigma(v_1) - \sigma(v_0)$, where $v_0$ and $v_1$ are the vertices of $\Delta^1$. Applying the [augmentation map](@entry_id:272732) gives $\epsilon(\partial_1(\sigma)) = \epsilon(\sigma(v_1)) - \epsilon(\sigma(v_0)) = 1 - 1 = 0$. This ensures that the composition $\epsilon \circ \partial_1$ is the zero map.

This compatibility allows us to extend the standard [chain complex](@entry_id:150246) to the **augmented singular [chain complex](@entry_id:150246)**:
$$ \dots \xrightarrow{\partial_3} C_2(X) \xrightarrow{\partial_2} C_1(X) \xrightarrow{\partial_1} C_0(X) \xrightarrow{\epsilon} \mathbb{Z} \to 0 $$
The **$n$-th [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) group** of $X$, denoted $\tilde{H}_n(X)$, is defined as the $n$-th homology group of this augmented complex.

Let's immediately apply this definition to a single-point space $X=\{p\}$ to see its effect [@problem_id:1654895]. For each dimension $n \ge 0$, there is exactly one [continuous map](@entry_id:153772) $\sigma_n: \Delta^n \to \{p\}$, the constant map. Thus, the chain group $C_n(\{p\})$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, generated by $\sigma_n$. The [boundary operator](@entry_id:160216) $\partial_n(\sigma_n) = \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i \sigma_{n-1}$ acts as multiplication by $1$ if $n$ is even and $n>0$, and as multiplication by $0$ if $n$ is odd. The [augmentation map](@entry_id:272732) $\epsilon: C_0(\{p\}) \to \mathbb{Z}$ sends the generator $\sigma_0$ to $1$, so it is an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127). The augmented complex is:
$$ \dots \xrightarrow{0} \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{\cong} \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{0} \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{\cong} \mathbb{Z} \to 0 $$
The homology of this complex is readily calculated. For $n \ge 1$, if $n$ is odd, $\ker(\partial_n) = \mathbb{Z}$ but $\text{im}(\partial_{n+1})=\mathbb{Z}$ (since $\partial_{n+1}$ is an isomorphism), so $\tilde{H}_n(\{p\}) = \mathbb{Z}/\mathbb{Z} = 0$. If $n$ is even, $\ker(\partial_n) = 0$, so $\tilde{H}_n(\{p\}) = 0$. For $n=0$, $\tilde{H}_0(\{p\}) = \ker(\epsilon)/\text{im}(\partial_1)$. Since $\epsilon$ is an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127), its kernel is trivial, so $\tilde{H}_0(\{p\}) = 0$. Thus, we achieve our goal: $\tilde{H}_n(\{p\}) = 0$ for all $n \ge 0$. A similar, more straightforward analysis shows that the [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) of the empty space is also trivial in all dimensions [@problem_id:1633160].

### Relationship to Standard Homology

The modification to the [chain complex](@entry_id:150246) only occurs at the "end" of the chain, suggesting that the reduced and standard homology groups should be closely related.

For dimensions $n \ge 1$, the definition of the $n$-th [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) group is $\tilde{H}_n(X) = \ker(\partial_n) / \text{im}(\partial_{n+1})$. This is identical to the definition of the standard homology group $H_n(X)$. Therefore, for any topological space $X$, we have a direct [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127):
$$ \tilde{H}_n(X) \cong H_n(X) \quad \text{for all } n \ge 1 $$
The only potential difference lies in dimension zero [@problem_id:1668774]. Let's examine this case. The definitions are:
- $H_0(X) = \ker(\partial_0) / \text{im}(\partial_1) = C_0(X) / \text{im}(\partial_1)$ (since $\partial_0=0$)
- $\tilde{H}_0(X) = \ker(\epsilon) / \text{im}(\partial_1)$

Because $\epsilon \circ \partial_1 = 0$, the [augmentation map](@entry_id:272732) $\epsilon$ descends to a well-defined homomorphism on the [quotient group](@entry_id:142790) $H_0(X)$, giving $\epsilon_*: H_0(X) \to \mathbb{Z}$. The kernel of this map is precisely $(\ker \epsilon) / \text{im}(\partial_1)$, which is by definition $\tilde{H}_0(X)$. Furthermore, if $X$ is non-empty, we can pick a point $x \in X$, and its homology class $[x] \in H_0(X)$ is mapped to $\epsilon_*([x]) = 1$. This means $\epsilon_*$ is surjective. We therefore have a [short exact sequence](@entry_id:137930):
$$ 0 \to \tilde{H}_0(X) \to H_0(X) \xrightarrow{\epsilon_*} \mathbb{Z} \to 0 $$
Since $\mathbb{Z}$ is a free abelian group, this sequence splits. This provides the fundamental relationship between zeroth standard and [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) for any non-empty space $X$:
$$ H_0(X) \cong \tilde{H}_0(X) \oplus \mathbb{Z} $$
This relationship gives a clear interpretation of $\tilde{H}_0(X)$. We know that $H_0(X)$ is the free abelian group on the set of path components of $X$. If $X$ has $k$ path components, then $H_0(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}^k$. The formula above implies that $\tilde{H}_0(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$. In other words, the rank of the zeroth [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) group is one less than the number of path components [@problem_id:1668756].

For instance, consider a discrete space $X = \{p_1, p_2, p_3\}$ with three points. It has three path components, so $H_0(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}^3$. Our formula predicts $\tilde{H}_0(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$. We can see this directly from the definition [@problem_id:1668777]. Since the space is discrete, $\text{im}(\partial_1)=0$, so $\tilde{H}_0(X) = \ker(\epsilon)$. A 0-chain is an element $c = a_1[p_1] + a_2[p_2] + a_3[p_3]$ where $a_i \in \mathbb{Z}$. It lies in the kernel of $\epsilon$ if and only if $a_1+a_2+a_3=0$. The subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}^3$ satisfying this condition is a free [abelian group](@entry_id:139381) of rank 2, with a basis given by, for example, $\{[p_1] - [p_2], [p_1] - [p_3]\}$.

### Core Properties and Applications

The primary utility of [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) lies in its ability to simplify fundamental theorems by treating contractible spaces as genuinely trivial from a homological perspective.

A non-empty space $X$ is **contractible** if its identity map, $\text{id}_X: X \to X$, is homotopic to a constant map, $c_p: X \to X$, where $c_p(x) = p$ for some fixed point $p \in X$. The homotopy axiom states that homotopic maps induce identical homomorphisms on homology. Applying this to [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187), we have:
$$ (\text{id}_X)_* = (c_p)_* : \tilde{H}_n(X) \to \tilde{H}_n(X) $$
The homomorphism $(\text{id}_X)_*$ induced by the identity map is simply the identity homomorphism on the group $\tilde{H}_n(X)$. The homomorphism $(c_p)_*$ induced by the constant map can be analyzed by factoring $c_p$ through the one-point space $\{p\}$, as $X \xrightarrow{f} \{p\} \xrightarrow{i} X$. By [functoriality](@entry_id:150069), $(c_p)_* = i_* \circ f_*$. This composition of homomorphisms passes through the group $\tilde{H}_n(\{p\})$:
$$ \tilde{H}_n(X) \xrightarrow{f_*} \tilde{H}_n(\{p\}) \xrightarrow{i_*} \tilde{H}_n(X) $$
As we established, the [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) of a point is the trivial group $\{0\}$ in all dimensions. Any homomorphism that factors through the trivial group must be the zero homomorphism. Therefore, $(c_p)_*$ is the zero map, sending every element of $\tilde{H}_n(X)$ to the zero element.

Equating the two sides, we find that the identity homomorphism on $\tilde{H}_n(X)$ is the same as the zero homomorphism. This can only be true if the group itself is the [trivial group](@entry_id:151996). This proves a central result of the theory [@problem_id:1655132]:

**Theorem:** If $X$ is a non-empty contractible space, then $\tilde{H}_n(X) = \{0\}$ for all $n \ge 0$.

A direct and important application of this theorem concerns the **cone** on a space $X$, denoted $CX$. The cone is formed by taking the product $X \times [0,1]$ and collapsing the "top" end, $X \times \{1\}$, to a single point. For any non-empty space $X$, its cone $CX$ is contractible. A homotopy can be defined that linearly retracts the cone along lines connecting points to the apex. As a direct consequence, the [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) of any cone is trivial in all dimensions [@problem_id:1668753]. This result holds regardless of the complexity of the original space $X$.

### Geometric and Functorial Perspectives

Reduced homology is not merely an algebraic convenience; it is deeply intertwined with geometric constructions, particularly [relative homology](@entry_id:159348) and [quotient spaces](@entry_id:274314).

#### Reduced Homology as Relative Homology

A powerful alternative viewpoint is that [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) is equivalent to the homology of a space relative to a basepoint. Let $X$ be a non-empty space and let $x_0 \in X$ be a chosen basepoint. Consider the long exact sequence of the pair $(X, \{x_0\})$ in [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187):
$$ \dots \to \tilde{H}_n(\{x_0\}) \to \tilde{H}_n(X) \to H_n(X, x_0) \to \tilde{H}_{n-1}(\{x_0\}) \to \dots $$
(Note that for a non-empty subspace $A$, the relative groups $\tilde{H}_n(X,A)$ and $H_n(X,A)$ are identical.)

We have shown that $\tilde{H}_k(\{x_0\}) = \{0\}$ for all $k \ge 0$. Substituting this into the long exact sequence causes it to break into a series of short [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) of the form:
$$ 0 \to \tilde{H}_n(X) \to H_n(X, x_0) \to 0 $$
Exactness at $\tilde{H}_n(X)$ implies the map is injective, and exactness at $H_n(X, x_0)$ implies it is surjective. Therefore, the map is an isomorphism. This establishes the fundamental equivalence [@problem_id:1680222]:
$$ \tilde{H}_n(X) \cong H_n(X, x_0) $$
This result provides a geometric interpretation for [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187): it is the homology of the space that remains after we have "quotiented out" a point. This aligns perfectly with the algebraic definition, where we effectively "remove" one generator from the [zeroth homology group](@entry_id:261808).

#### Functorial Properties and Quotient Spaces

The behavior of [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) under [continuous maps](@entry_id:153855) is often simpler and more intuitive. Consider a constant map $f: X \to Y$ given by $f(x)=y_0$ for some fixed $y_0 \in Y$. This map can be factored through the one-point space $\{y_0\}$. The [induced homomorphism](@entry_id:149311) on [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187), $f_*$, must therefore factor through $\tilde{H}_n(\{y_0\}) = \{0\}$. Consequently, any constant map induces the zero homomorphism on [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) in all dimensions [@problem_id:1668750].

This ties in with another important tool: the relationship between [relative homology](@entry_id:159348) and [quotient spaces](@entry_id:274314). For a "good pair" of spaces $(X,A)$ (which includes most pairs encountered in introductory courses), there is a [natural isomorphism](@entry_id:276379) $H_n(X,A) \cong \tilde{H}_n(X/A)$, where $X/A$ is the space obtained by collapsing the subspace $A$ to a point.

Combining these ideas provides a powerful computational framework. For example, let $X = S^2 \vee S^1$ be the [wedge sum](@entry_id:270607) of a 2-sphere and a circle, and let $A = S^2$ be the sphere subspace [@problem_id:1668739]. The [quotient space](@entry_id:148218) $X/A$ is formed by collapsing the 2-sphere to the basepoint where it was attached to the circle. The result is a space homeomorphic to the circle, $S^1$. Using the isomorphism for good pairs and our [relative homology](@entry_id:159348) interpretation, we can compute:
$$ \tilde{H}_n(S^1) \cong \tilde{H}_n(X/A) \cong H_n(X,A) $$
The [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) of $S^1$ is well-known to be $\mathbb{Z}$ for $n=1$ and trivial otherwise. This demonstrates how these interconnected concepts—[reduced homology](@entry_id:274187), [relative homology](@entry_id:159348), and [quotient spaces](@entry_id:274314)—work together to unravel the algebraic-topological structure of complex spaces.
