All points on the boundary $\\partial I^n$ are required to map to the single point $x_0$.\n\nFor two such maps, $f$ and $g$, their composition, denoted $f + g$, is defined by concatenating them along the first coordinate, $t_1$.

A fundamental result is that for $n \\ge 2$, the group $\\pi_n(X, x_0)$ is abelian, meaning $[f] + [g] = [g] + [f]$. This is proven by constructing a homotopy between $f + g$ and $g + f$.\n\nConsider the specific case for $n=2$, with maps $f, g: (I^2, \\partial I^2) \\to (X, x_0)$. The proof that $[f]+[g]=[g]+[f]$ involves a continuous deformation of the domain $I^2$. This deformation can be described conceptually as a sequence of steps. In the initial configuration for $f+g$, the map $f$ is effectively defined on the left half of the square $I^2$ and $g$ on the right half. The homotopy continuously transforms this into the configuration for $g+f$, where $g$ is on the left and $f$ is on the right.\n\nWhich of the following sequences of geometric transformations on the domain $I^2$ correctly describes a valid homotopy from $f+g$ to $g+f$?\n\nA. The domain of $f$ (left half) is continuously shrunk horizontally to the line $t_1=0$, while the domain of $g$ (right half) is simultaneously shrunk to the line $t_1=1$. Then, the shrunken domains are swapped by moving along the line $t_2=1/2$ and expanded back to fill the opposite halves.\n\nB. The active domains of $f$ and $g$ are first shrunk to smaller disjoint rectangles, staying on the left and right sides respectively, creating an empty middle region. Then, the rectangle for $f$ is moved to the right and the rectangle for $g$ is moved to the left through the same horizontal path in the empty middle region. Finally, they are expanded to fill their new halves.\n\nC. The active domains of $f$ and $g$ are first shrunk into small disjoint rectangles, creating empty space around them. The rectangle corresponding to $f$ is then moved along a path in the bottom part of the square towards the right side, while the rectangle for $g$ is simultaneously moved along a path in the top part of the square towards the left side. After they have swapped horizontal positions, they are expanded to fill the opposite halves of the square.\n\nD. The composition is redefined to be along the $t_2$ axis. The proof then proceeds by showing that concatenation along the $t_1$ axis is homotopic to concatenation along the $t_2$ axis, which is then shown to be equivalent to $g+f$ by a rotation of the domain cube.\n\nE. The left half of the square, corresponding to the domain of $f$, is continuously translated to the right half, while the right half, corresponding to the domain of $g$, is simultaneously translated to the left half. This swaps their positions, thus demonstrating the homotopy.", "solution": "The problem asks for the correct conceptual description of the homotopy that proves $\\pi_2(X, x_0)$ is abelian. The key is to understand how a map $f+g$ can be continuously deformed into $g+f$. Let the coordinates on the domain $I^2$ be $(t_1, t_2)$.\n\nThe initial map $f+g$ has $f$ active on the left half of the square, $[0, 1/2] \\times [0, 1]$, and $g$ active on the right half, $[1/2, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\nThe target map $g+f$ has $g$ active on the left half, $[0, 1/2] \\times [0, 1]$, and $f$ active on the right half, $[1/2, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\n\nWe need to find a continuous deformation from the first configuration to the second. This deformation is a homotopy $H: I^2 \\times I \\to X$. Let's analyze the process, often known as the Eckmann-Hilton argument.\n\nThe core idea is that since we are in dimension $n=2$ (or higher), we have \"room to maneuver\". If we were trying to do this for $\\pi_1$ (on the interval $I^1$), the domains for $f$ and $g$ would be sub-intervals, and they could not pass each other without colliding. However, in $I^2$, the domains are sub-rectangles, and they can move around each other using the second dimension.\n\nThe general strategy is as follows:\n1.  **Shrink:** First, we shrink the regions where $f$ and $g$ are non-trivial into smaller rectangles, creating a \"buffer zone\" of points that are all mapped to the basepoint $x_0$. For example, we can deform the map so that $f$ is active only on a small rectangle like $[1/4, 3/8] \\times [1/4, 3/4]$ and $g$ is active on $[5/8, 3/4] \\times [1/4, 3/4]$. The rest of $I^2$ maps to $x_0$. This is a continuous process.\n\n2.  **Swap:** With this buffer zone, we can now move the two small active domains. To swap their horizontal positions, the rectangle for $f$ must move from the left side to the right side, and the rectangle for $g$ must move from the right to the left. To avoid colliding, they must take different paths. For instance, the $f$-rectangle can slide to the right along a path in the lower half of the square (e.g., keeping its $t_2$-coordinates between $1/4$ and $1/2$), while the $g$-rectangle slides to the left along a path in the upper half (e.g., keeping its $t_2$-coordinates between $1/2$ and $3/4$). Because their paths are separated in the vertical ($t_2$) direction, their domains never intersect during the movement. This is the crucial step that relies on the dimension being at least 2.\n\n3.  **Expand:** Once the rectangles have swapped their horizontal positions, we reverse the shrinking process. The new $g$-rectangle on the left is expanded to fill the entire left half $[0, 1/2] \\times [0, 1]$, and the new $f$-rectangle on the right is expanded to fill the right half $[1/2, 1] \\times [0, 1]$. The final configuration is exactly the map $g+f$.\n\nThis entire sequence of shrinking, sliding along separate paths, and expanding constitutes a valid homotopy.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this understanding:\n*   A: This option describes shrinking domains to lines, which is not how the maps are defined. More importantly, it suggests they swap by moving along the *same* line, which would cause a collision. This is incorrect.\n*   B: This option correctly identifies the need to shrink the domains first. However, it claims they move through the *same horizontal path*. This would cause their domains to intersect or \"pass through\" each other, which is not a valid way to deform the map. It's the central problem this homotopy is designed to solve. This is incorrect.\n*   C: This option accurately describes the correct procedure. The domains shrink, they move along separate paths using the second dimension (\"bottom part\" vs \"top part\") to avoid collision, and then they expand. This correctly captures the essence of the Eckmann-Hilton argument. This is the correct answer.\n*   D: This describes a different, valid argument for commutativity that involves showing two different composition laws are homotopic. However, it does not describe the direct deformation of $f+g$ to $g+f$ via the \"sliding boxes\" method, which is what options A, B, and C are concerned with. The question is asking for a description of the geometric transformation, and C is the canonical one.\n*   E: A simultaneous translation of the entire halves would mean the two domains would have to pass through each other, which is not a single-valued map during the process. This is geometrically impossible for a continuous deformation of this type. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct description of the homotopy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1630846"}, {"introduction": "After grasping the geometric intuition of \"sliding boxes,\" the next step is to formalize this picture with precise mathematics.

We need to find a linear map that takes the domain $D_f$ to $I^2$. Let $(t_1, t_2)$ be the coordinates in $D_f$, and let $(u_1, u_2)$ be the coordinates in $I^2$ which will be the arguments of $f$.\n\nFor the first coordinate, $t_1$ ranges over $[0, 1/2]$. We need to map this interval linearly to $[0, 1]$ for $u_1$. The linear transformation is of the form $u_1 = a t_1 + b$.\n- When $t_1 = 0$, we want $u_1 = 0$. This gives $a(0) + b = 0 \\implies b=0$.\n- When $t_1 = 1/2$, we want $u_1 = 1$. This gives $a(1/2) = 1 \\implies a=2$.\nSo, the transformation for the first coordinate is $u_1 = 2t_1$.\n\nFor the second coordinate, $t_2$ ranges over $[1/2, 1]$. We need to map this interval linearly to $[0, 1]$ for $u_2$. The linear transformation is of the form $u_2 = c t_2 + d$.\n- When $t_2 = 1/2$, we want $u_2 = 0$. This gives $c(1/2) + d = 0$.\n- When $t_2 = 1$, we want $u_2 = 1$. This gives $c(1) + d = 1$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives $c(1 - 1/2) = 1 - 0 \\implies c/2 = 1 \\implies c=2$.\nSubstituting $c=2$ into $c/2+d=0$ gives $1+d=0 \\implies d=-1$.\nSo, the transformation for the second coordinate is $u_2 = 2t_2 - 1$.\n\nTherefore, for $(t_1, t_2) \\in D_f$, the map is given by $f(u_1, u_2) = f(2t_1, 2t_2 - 1)$.\n\n**2.

We map this to $[0, 1]$ for $v_1$. The transformation is $v_1 = a t_1 + b$.\n- When $t_1 = 1/2$, we want $v_1 = 0 \\implies a/2 + b = 0$.\n- When $t_1 = 1$, we want $v_1 = 1 \\implies a + b = 1$.\nSubtracting the equations gives $a/2 = 1 \\implies a=2$. Then $b = 1 - a = 1 - 2 = -1$.\nSo, the transformation is $v_1 = 2t_1 - 1$.\n\nFor the second coordinate, $t_2$ ranges over $[0, 1/2]$. We map this to $[0, 1]$ for $v_2$. The transformation is $v_2 = c t_2 + d$.\n- When $t_2 = 0$, we want $v_2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n- When $t_2 = 1/2$, we want $v_2 = 1 \\implies c/2 = 1 \\implies c=2$.\nSo, the transformation is $v_2 = 2t_2$.\n\nTherefore, for $(t_1, t_2) \\in D_g$, the map is given by $g(v_1, v_2) = g(2t_1 - 1, 2t_2)$.\n\n**3.

While the naive piecewise formula may require a pinching adjustment near the seam for point-set continuity, the operation is well-defined on homotopy classes and is the standard one in relative homotopy theory.\n- D is false because inverses exist; reflecting the first coordinate and reparametrizing yields a representative satisfying the relative boundary conditions.\n- E is false because the constant map at $x_{0}\\in A$ sends $\\partial I^{2}$ into $A$ and $J^{1}$ to $x_{0}$, so it is a valid identity element.\n\nTherefore, the correct reason the Eckmann–Hilton homotopy fails is exactly that it would force commutativity of the top-edge loops in $A$, which need not hold for $A=S^{1}\\vee S^{1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1630863"}]}
