## Introduction
In the study of algebraic topology, our goal is often to understand the properties of [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056) and the [continuous maps](@entry_id:153855) between them. While tools like homology and homotopy groups provide powerful algebraic invariants for spaces, analyzing the maps themselves can be challenging. A central problem is that many of our most effective techniques, such as the [long exact sequence of a pair](@entry_id:158857), are designed for inclusion maps, yet most maps are not simple inclusions. The [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) offers an elegant and powerful solution to this problem. It is a fundamental construction that transforms any arbitrary [continuous map](@entry_id:153772) into a space where the map becomes a "nice" inclusion, without losing essential information about the [target space](@entry_id:143180).

This article provides a comprehensive introduction to the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932), exploring its definition, properties, and applications across three chapters. In "Principles and Mechanisms," you will learn the formal definition of the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932), understand its most important property—that it is homotopy equivalent to its target space—and see how this works through the concept of a [deformation retract](@entry_id:154224). In "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," we will explore how this construction is used to build complex spaces, its intimate relationship with the [mapping cone](@entry_id:261103) and CW-complexes, and its role in revealing deep connections between topology and algebra. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will guide you through concrete examples to solidify your understanding of these theoretical concepts. By the end, you will see how the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) serves as an indispensable bridge between the study of maps and the study of spaces.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) is a fundamental construction in algebraic topology that provides a powerful method for studying [continuous maps](@entry_id:153855) between topological spaces. Its primary utility lies in its ability to convert any continuous map $f: X \to Y$ into a topologically 'nicer' map, namely an inclusion, without altering the essential homotopy-theoretic information of the [target space](@entry_id:143180). This process of transforming a map into a space allows us to deploy the full power of tools like homology theory to analyze the structure of the map itself.

### The Construction of the Mapping Cylinder

Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and let $f: X \to Y$ be a continuous map. The **[mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932)** of $f$, denoted $M_f$, is a new topological space constructed from the cylinder over $X$ and the space $Y$.

Formally, we begin with the disjoint union of the cylinder on $X$, which is the product space $X \times [0,1]$, and the space $Y$. The [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) $M_f$ is the quotient space of this disjoint union under an [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135) that "glues" one end of the cylinder to $Y$ according to the map $f$. Specifically, we define:

$M_f = (X \times [0,1] \sqcup Y) / \sim$

where the equivalence relation $\sim$ is generated by the identification $(x, 0) \sim f(x)$ for every $x \in X$. In this construction, we identify each point $(x,0)$ on the "bottom" lid of the cylinder with its image $f(x)$ in the space $Y$.

Points in $M_f$ are equivalence classes, denoted by $[z]$, where $z$ is a point in the original disjoint union. So a point in $M_f$ is either of the form $[(x, t)]$ for some $(x, t) \in X \times [0,1]$ with $t>0$, or it is of the form $[y]$ for some $y \in Y$. Note that points of the form $[(x,0)]$ are the same as points of the form $[f(x)]$.

For this construction to yield a well-behaved space, we generally need some assumptions on the input spaces and map. A key point-set [topological property](@entry_id:141605) is that the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) $M_f$ is a Hausdorff space if and only if the spaces $X$ and $Y$ are themselves Hausdorff and the map $f$ is continuous [@problem_id:1662465]. Throughout our discussion, we will assume these conditions hold.

Within the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) $M_f$, there are two subspaces of particular interest:
1.  The space $Y$ includes into $M_f$ via the map $i: Y \hookrightarrow M_f$ where $i(y) = [y]$.
2.  The space $X$ can be identified with the "top" lid of the cylinder, $X \times \{1\}$, via the inclusion $j: X \hookrightarrow M_f$ where $j(x) = [(x,1)]$.

### The Fundamental Homotopy Property

The most important property of the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) is that it is homotopy equivalent to the [target space](@entry_id:143180) $Y$. This means that while we have created a larger, more complex space, we have not changed the fundamental shape of $Y$ from the perspective of homotopy theory.

This result is established by showing that the subspace $Y$ is a **[strong deformation retract](@entry_id:155000)** of $M_f$. A [deformation retraction](@entry_id:148036) is a homotopy that continuously shrinks the larger space onto the smaller subspace. We can visualize this by imagining the cylinder part of $M_f$ being progressively "squeezed" down onto its base, which is attached to $Y$.

Let's define the homotopy $H: M_f \times [0,1] \to M_f$ as follows:
- For a point $[y]$ originating from $Y$, we set $H([y], s) = [y]$. The homotopy does not move points in $Y$.
- For a point $[(x, t)]$ originating from the cylinder $X \times [0,1]$, we set $H([(x,t)], s) = [(x, (1-s)t)]$.

This map is well-defined. At the interface where the spaces are glued, if we have a point $[(x,0)] = [f(x)]$, our definition gives $H([(x,0)], s) = [(x, 0)] = [f(x)]$, and since $f(x)$ is in $Y$, $H([f(x)], s) = [f(x)]$. The definitions agree.

At the start of the homotopy, for $s=0$, we have $H(z, 0) = z$ for all $z \in M_f$, which is the identity map on $M_f$. At the end of the homotopy, for $s=1$, any point $[(x,t)]$ is mapped to $[(x,0)]$, which is identified with $[f(x)] \in Y$. Points already in $Y$ remain in $Y$. Thus, the entire space $M_f$ is retracted onto the subspace $Y$.

Since $Y$ is a [deformation retract](@entry_id:154224) of $M_f$, the inclusion map $i: Y \hookrightarrow M_f$ is a homotopy equivalence. This has profound consequences. For example, it implies that $M_f$ and $Y$ have isomorphic homotopy groups, homology groups, and [cohomology groups](@entry_id:142450).

This property immediately explains why, for the inclusion map $i: S^1 \to S^2$ of the equator into the sphere, the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) $M_i$ is homotopy equivalent to the sphere $S^2$ [@problem_id:1662429]. The construction might seem to create a more complicated object, but its homotopy type remains that of $S^2$. The [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) is therefore contractible if and only if the [target space](@entry_id:143180) $Y$ is contractible [@problem_id:1662458].

### Geometric Intuition from Key Examples

To build a better intuition for the structure of mapping cylinders, it is instructive to examine a few canonical cases.

#### Case 1: The Constant Map
Consider a map $f: X \to Y$ that is constant, sending every point of $X$ to a single point $y_0 \in Y$. The [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) $M_f$ is formed by taking $X \times [0,1]$ and identifying the entire base $X \times \{0\}$ with the single point $y_0$. The space obtained by taking a cylinder $X \times [0,1]$ and collapsing one end $X \times \{0\}$ to a single point is precisely the definition of the **cone on X**, denoted $CX$. Therefore, for a constant map, $M_f$ is the space formed by taking the cone $CX$ and the space $Y$ and identifying the cone point of $CX$ with the point $y_0 \in Y$.

A concrete example is the constant map $f: S^1 \to \{p\}$ where $\{p\}$ is a one-point space [@problem_id:1662451]. The [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) $M_f$ is simply the cone on the circle, $C(S^1)$. This space is homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional disk, $D^2$. One can visualize this by picturing the cylinder $S^1 \times [0,1]$ and shrinking the bottom circle $S^1 \times \{0\}$ to a single point, which forms the apex of a cone, whose slanted sides are filled in to form a disk.

#### Case 2: The Homeomorphism
Now, consider the opposite extreme where the map $f: X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism. Intuitively, since $X$ and $Y$ are "the same" topologically, the gluing process should not introduce any complex folding or identification. The [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) $M_f$ is formed by taking $X \times [0,1]$ and gluing its base $X \times \{0\}$ to $Y$ via the homeomorphism $f$. We can construct an explicit [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933) $F: M_f \to Y \times [0,1]$:
- For a point $[y] \in M_f$ coming from $Y$, define $F([y]) = (y,0)$.
- For a point $[(x,t)] \in M_f$ coming from the cylinder, define $F([(x,t)]) = (f(x), t)$.

This map is well-defined since at the identification $[(x,0)]=[f(x)]$, we have $F([(x,0)]) = (f(x),0)$ and $F([f(x)]) = (f(x),0)$. Because $f$ is a [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933), one can show this map $F$ is also a homeomorphism. Thus, if $f$ is a homeomorphism, its [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) $M_f$ is simply homeomorphic to the cylinder $Y \times [0,1]$ (or, equivalently, $X \times [0,1]$) [@problem_id:1662474]. The [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) construction effectively "untwists" the map $f$ into a straight cylinder.

#### Case 3: Non-Injective Maps and Manifolds
The [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) construction can create singularities even when starting with well-behaved spaces like manifolds. Consider an immersion $f: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ that traces a "figure-eight" curve, with a single self-intersection at the origin $p_0 = (0,0)$ [@problem_id:1662420]. Let the two points on the circle that map to the origin be $z_1$ and $z_2$.

The resulting [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) $M_f$ will fail to be a [2-manifold](@entry_id:152719) at the point $P = [p_0] \in M_f$. To see why, consider a small neighborhood of $P$.
- In the $\mathbb{R}^2$ part of the construction, a small disk around $p_0$ is divided into four open sectors by the two crossing branches of the [figure-eight curve](@entry_id:167790). These are four 2-dimensional "sheets" that meet at $P$.
- From the cylinder $S^1 \times [0,1]$, the part of the cylinder near $(z_1, 0)$ (for $t > 0$) provides another 2-dimensional sheet attached along one branch of the curve at $p_0$.
- Similarly, the part of the cylinder near $(z_2, 0)$ provides a sixth 2-dimensional sheet attached along the other branch.

In total, any small neighborhood of the point $P$ contains pieces of six distinct 2-dimensional regions that all meet at $P$. This local structure is not homeomorphic to an open disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where every point on an axis is on the boundary of only two regions (the upper and lower half-planes). Therefore, $M_f$ is not a [2-manifold](@entry_id:152719). This illustrates how the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) encodes the singularity structure of a map into the local topology of a point.

### Connection to the Mapping Cone

The [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) is intimately related to another fundamental construction, the **[mapping cone](@entry_id:261103)**. The [mapping cone](@entry_id:261103) of a map $f: X \to Y$, denoted $C_f$, is obtained by attaching the cone over $X$ to $Y$ via the map $f$. Formally, $C_f$ is the quotient space $(CX \sqcup Y) / \sim$, where a point $x$ on the base of the cone $CX$ is identified with $f(x) \in Y$.

There is a very simple and direct relationship between these two constructions: the [mapping cone](@entry_id:261103) $C_f$ is precisely the space obtained by taking the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) $M_f$ and collapsing its top lid, $X \times \{1\}$, to a single point.
$C_f \cong M_f / (X \times \{1\})$

Let's return to our example of the constant map $f: S^1 \to \{p\}$ [@problem_id:1662428]. We established that its [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) $M_f$ is homeomorphic to the disk $D^2$. The top lid $X \times \{1\}$ corresponds to the boundary circle $\partial D^2$. Collapsing the boundary of a disk to a point yields a 2-sphere, $S^2$. Therefore, the [mapping cone](@entry_id:261103) $C_f$ for this map is homeomorphic to $S^2$. This is also consistent with the direct definition of $C_f$, which in this case is the suspension of $S^1$, $\Sigma S^1$, a well-known space homeomorphic to $S^2$.

### Applications in Homology Theory

The true power of the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) becomes apparent when used in conjunction with algebraic invariants like homology. By converting a map $f$ into an inclusion $j: X \to M_f$, we can analyze $f$ using the [long exact sequence of a pair](@entry_id:158857).

Consider the pair $(M_f, j(X))$, where for simplicity we denote $j(X)$ as $X$. The [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) in homology for this pair is:
$\cdots \to H_n(X) \xrightarrow{j_*} H_n(M_f) \to H_n(M_f, X) \to H_{n-1}(X) \xrightarrow{j_*} \cdots$

We can substitute our knowledge of the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) into this sequence.
1.  Since $M_f$ deformation retracts onto $Y$, the inclusion $i: Y \to M_f$ induces an isomorphism on homology, $H_n(M_f) \cong H_n(Y)$.
2.  The map $j: X \to M_f$ followed by the [deformation retraction](@entry_id:148036) $r: M_f \to Y$ is precisely the original map $f$ (up to homotopy). Therefore, the [induced map on homology](@entry_id:265781), $j_*: H_n(X) \to H_n(M_f)$, is equivalent to $f_*: H_n(X) \to H_n(Y)$ under the isomorphism $H_n(M_f) \cong H_n(Y)$.

Substituting these facts, the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) for the pair $(M_f, X)$ becomes a sequence involving the map $f$ directly:
$\cdots \to H_n(X) \xrightarrow{f_*} H_n(Y) \to H_n(M_f, X) \to H_{n-1}(X) \xrightarrow{f_*} H_{n-1}(Y) \to \cdots$

This sequence is extremely useful. The [relative homology groups](@entry_id:159711) $H_n(M_f, X)$ measure the "algebraic consequence" of the map $f$. From the exactness of the sequence, we can identify these groups. For example:
- $H_n(M_f, X) \cong \text{coker}(f_*: H_n(X) \to H_n(Y))$ if $H_{n-1}(X)$ maps injectively.
- $H_n(M_f, X) \cong \ker(f_*: H_{n-1}(X) \to H_{n-1}(Y))$ if the map from $H_n(Y)$ is zero.

Furthermore, since $C_f \cong M_f/X$, the [relative homology](@entry_id:159348) group is isomorphic to the [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) of the [mapping cone](@entry_id:261103): $H_n(M_f, X) \cong \tilde{H}_n(C_f)$. This connects the [long exact sequence of a pair](@entry_id:158857) to the long exact sequence associated with the [cofibration](@entry_id:273277) $X \to Y \to C_f$.

As a concrete application [@problem_id:1662404], consider a map $f: S^2 \vee S^2 \to S^2$ that has degree 6 on the first sphere and degree 10 on the second. Here $X = S^2 \vee S^2$ and $Y = S^2$. The [induced map](@entry_id:271712) on second homology is $f_*: \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$, given by $f_*(a,b) = 6a+10b$.
From the long exact sequence segment
$0 = H_3(Y) \to H_3(M_f, X) \to H_2(X) \xrightarrow{f_*} H_2(Y)$
we deduce that $H_3(M_f, X) \cong \ker(f_*)$. The kernel of this map is the [infinite cyclic group](@entry_id:139160) generated by the element $(5, -3)$, so $H_3(M_f, X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$.
From the segment
$H_2(X) \xrightarrow{f_*} H_2(Y) \to H_2(M_f, X) \to H_1(X) = 0$
we deduce that $H_2(M_f, X) \cong \text{coker}(f_*)$. The image of $f_*$ is the subgroup $2\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Z}$, so the cokernel is $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. This demonstrates how the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) construction translates a question about a map's degrees into a concrete computation of homology groups.

### Homotopy Invariance

A final crucial property is that the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) construction respects homotopy classes of maps. That is, if two maps $f_0, f_1: X \to Y$ are homotopic, then their mapping cylinders $M_{f_0}$ and $M_{f_1}$ are homotopy equivalent. This ensures that the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) is a meaningful tool in homotopy theory, where spaces and maps are often only considered up to homotopy equivalence.

To demonstrate this, one must construct homotopy equivalences $g: M_{f_0} \to M_{f_1}$ and $h: M_{f_1} \to M_{f_0}$. Let's outline the construction of the map $g$, given a homotopy $H: X \times [0,1] \to Y$ from $f_0$ to $f_1$ (so $H(x,0)=f_0(x)$ and $H(x,1)=f_1(x)$).

The idea is to use the first half of the cylinder parameter in $M_{f_0}$ to "run through the homotopy" and the second half to form the new cylinder of $M_{f_1}$. The map $g: M_{f_0} \to M_{f_1}$ is defined as follows [@problem_id:1662417]:
- On the subspace $Y$, $g$ is the identity: $g([y]) = [y]$.
- On the cylinder part of $M_{f_0}$, for a point $[(x, t)]$, the map is piecewise:
  $g([x,t]) = \begin{cases} [H(x, 2t)]  \text{if } 0 \le t \le 1/2 \\ [(x, 2t-1)]  \text{if } 1/2 \le t \le 1 \end{cases}$

Let's check the continuity at the boundaries. At $t=0$, $g([x,0]) = [H(x,0)] = [f_0(x)]$, which is consistent with $g$ being the identity on $Y$. At the midpoint $t=1/2$, the first formula gives $[H(x,1)] = [f_1(x)]$. The second formula gives $[(x,0)]$, which in the space $M_{f_1}$ is identified with $[f_1(x)]$. Since the definitions match at the transition point, the map $g$ is continuous. One can construct a similar map $h: M_{f_1} \to M_{f_0}$ using the reverse homotopy and show that $g \circ h$ and $h \circ g$ are homotopic to the respective identity maps. This confirms that $M_{f_0} \simeq M_{f_1}$.

In summary, the [mapping cylinder](@entry_id:155932) is a versatile and indispensable tool. It provides a bridge between maps and spaces, allowing the powerful machinery of algebraic topology to be brought to bear on the study of continuous functions themselves.
