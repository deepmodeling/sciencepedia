## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the algebraic formalism of the [long exact sequence of a pair](@entry_id:158857) in the preceding chapter, we now turn our attention to its remarkable utility. This sequence is far from being a mere theoretical construct; it is a powerful computational engine and a profound conceptual lens through which the structure of topological spaces can be analyzed. This chapter will demonstrate the power of the long exact sequence by exploring its applications in computing homotopy groups, analyzing the effects of [continuous maps](@entry_id:153855), and constructing the foundations of cellular homotopy theory. Furthermore, we will see how this fundamental sequence serves as a blueprint for other [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) in algebraic topology and provides a crucial bridge to the parallel theory of [singular homology](@entry_id:158380).

### Direct Computation of Homotopy Groups

One of the most immediate and impactful applications of the long exact sequence is in the computation of homotopy groups. By relating the known groups of a space and a subspace to the unknown relative groups, the sequence often simplifies to reveal the structure of a group that would be difficult to compute directly.

#### The Fundamental Isomorphism for Disks and Spheres

A canonical example, which forms a cornerstone of many further calculations, involves the pair $(D^n, S^{n-1})$, consisting of the $n$-dimensional disk and its boundary, the $(n-1)$-sphere. For any $n \ge 1$, the disk $D^n$ is contractible, meaning all of its homotopy groups $\pi_k(D^n)$ are trivial for $k \ge 1$. Let us examine the portion of the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) for this pair:
$$ \dots \to \pi_k(D^n) \to \pi_k(D^n, S^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{\partial} \pi_{k-1}(S^{n-1}) \to \pi_{k-1}(D^n) \to \dots $$
Substituting the triviality of the homotopy groups of $D^n$, we obtain:
$$ \dots \to 0 \to \pi_k(D^n, S^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{\partial} \pi_{k-1}(S^{n-1}) \to 0 \to \dots $$
Exactness at $\pi_k(D^n, S^{n-1})$ and $\pi_{k-1}(S^{n-1})$ implies that the [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713) $\partial$ is both injective and surjective. Therefore, $\partial$ is an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127), and we have the fundamental result:
$$ \pi_k(D^n, S^{n-1}) \cong \pi_{k-1}(S^{n-1}) $$
This isomorphism is a powerful computational tool. For instance, if we wish to determine the relative homotopy group $\pi_5(D^4, S^3)$, we can immediately conclude it is isomorphic to $\pi_4(S^3)$. Given the known result that $\pi_4(S^3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$, we find that $\pi_5(D^4, S^3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$. This demonstrates how a question about a relative group is translated into a more familiar question about an absolute group of a lower-dimensional sphere. [@problem_id:1656801]

#### Relative Homotopy Groups as Kernels

In many situations, the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) does not simplify completely but instead identifies a relative homotopy group with the [kernel of a homomorphism](@entry_id:145895) appearing in the sequence. Consider the solid torus $X = D^2 \times S^1$ and its boundary, the torus $A = S^1 \times S^1$. To compute the second relative homotopy group $\pi_2(X, A)$, we examine the relevant part of the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438):
$$ \dots \to \pi_2(A) \to \pi_2(X) \to \pi_2(X, A) \to \pi_1(A) \xrightarrow{i_*} \pi_1(X) \to \dots $$
The solid torus $X$ deformation retracts onto its core circle, so its homotopy groups are those of $S^1$. In particular, $\pi_2(X) \cong \pi_2(S^1) = 0$. The boundary torus $A=S^1 \times S^1$ is also aspherical (its [universal cover](@entry_id:151142) is $\mathbb{R}^2$), which implies that $\pi_2(A) = 0$. The sequence thus reduces to:
$$ 0 \to \pi_2(X, A) \to \pi_1(A) \xrightarrow{i_*} \pi_1(X) $$
From exactness, we deduce that the map from $\pi_2(X,A)$ to $\pi_1(A)$ is injective, and its image is precisely the kernel of $i_*$. Thus, we have an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127) $\pi_2(X, A) \cong \ker(i_*)$. The analysis now shifts to understanding the homomorphism $i_*: \pi_1(S^1 \times S^1) \to \pi_1(D^2 \times S^1)$. The group $\pi_1(A) \cong \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ is generated by a meridian loop (the boundary of the $D^2$ factor) and a longitude loop (the $S^1$ factor). Within the solid torus $X$, the meridian loop can be contracted to a point by shrinking the disk, while the longitude loop represents the generator of $\pi_1(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$. The homomorphism $i_*$ is therefore the projection $(m, l) \mapsto l$. Its kernel is the subgroup generated by the meridian, which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. We conclude that $\pi_2(D^2 \times S^1, S^1 \times S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$. [@problem_id:1687553]

This technique reveals a deep connection between the second relative homotopy group and the algebraic structure of the fundamental groups. A more advanced example arises from the pair $(T^2, S^1 \vee S^1)$, where $T^2$ is the [2-torus](@entry_id:265991) and $A = S^1 \vee S^1$ is the wedge of two circles embedded as its standard meridian and longitude. A similar analysis of the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) establishes an isomorphism $\pi_2(T^2, A) \cong \ker(i_*: \pi_1(A) \to \pi_1(T^2))$. Here, $\pi_1(A)$ is the free group on two generators $F_2 = \langle a, b \rangle$, and $\pi_1(T^2)$ is the free [abelian group](@entry_id:139381) $\mathbb{Z}^2$. The map $i_*$ is the [abelianization](@entry_id:140523) homomorphism, and its kernel is famously the [commutator subgroup](@entry_id:140057) $[F_2, F_2]$. Thus, the long exact sequence unveils a striking identification: $\pi_2(T^2, S^1 \vee S^1) \cong [F_2, F_2]$. [@problem_id:1687560]

### Analyzing the Structure of Induced Maps

The [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) is not only for computing groups but also for understanding the homomorphisms $i_*: \pi_n(A) \to \pi_n(X)$ induced by the inclusion $i: A \hookrightarrow X$. The sequence provides a measure of how far $i_*$ is from being injective or surjective by relating its kernel and cokernel to [relative homotopy groups](@entry_id:261406).

#### The Splitting of Sequences for Retracts

A particularly elegant structural result emerges when the subspace $A$ is a retract of $X$. This means there exists a [continuous map](@entry_id:153772) $r: X \to A$ such that $r \circ i$ is the identity on $A$. On the level of homotopy groups, this implies that $r_* \circ i_* = \text{id}_{\pi_n(A)}$, which means that for every $n$, $i_*: \pi_n(A) \to \pi_n(X)$ is injective and its image is a [direct summand](@entry_id:150541) of $\pi_n(X)$.

Now consider the long exact sequence:
$$ \dots \to \pi_n(X, A) \xrightarrow{\partial_n} \pi_{n-1}(A) \xrightarrow{i_*} \pi_{n-1}(X) \to \dots $$
By [exactness](@entry_id:268999), the image of the boundary map $\partial_n$ is the kernel of $i_*$. Since we have established that $i_*$ is injective for all $n$, its kernel is trivial. This forces the boundary map $\partial_n$ to be the zero map for all $n$. The long exact sequence thus breaks apart into a collection of short [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503):
$$ 0 \to \pi_n(A) \xrightarrow{i_*} \pi_n(X) \xrightarrow{j_*} \pi_n(X, A) \to 0 $$
For $n \ge 2$, these are sequences of [abelian groups](@entry_id:145145). The existence of the retraction map provides a "splitting" homomorphism $r_*: \pi_n(X) \to \pi_n(A)$ which is a left-inverse to $i_*$. In the language of group theory, this implies that the [short exact sequence](@entry_id:137930) splits. Consequently, the middle group is the direct sum of the outer two:
$$ \pi_n(X) \cong \pi_n(A) \oplus \pi_n(X, A) $$
This provides a complete and satisfying description of the relationship between the absolute and [relative homotopy groups](@entry_id:261406) in the presence of a retraction. [@problem_id:1572293]

#### The Boundary Map as an Obstruction

When an inclusion map $i_*: \pi_n(A) \to \pi_n(X)$ is not injective, the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) identifies its kernel with the image of the [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713) $\partial_{n+1}$. A classic illustration is the inclusion of the equator $S^1$ into the sphere $S^2$. The [induced map](@entry_id:271712) on fundamental groups is $i_*: \pi_1(S^1) \to \pi_1(S^2)$. Since $\pi_1(S^2)$ is the [trivial group](@entry_id:151996), the homomorphism $i_*$ maps every element of $\pi_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ to the identity. Its kernel is therefore the entire group $\mathbb{Z}$. The long exact sequence for the pair $(S^2, S^1)$ tells us that this kernel is precisely the image of the boundary map $\partial: \pi_2(S^2, S^1) \to \pi_1(S^1)$. Thus, the fact that all loops on the equator become contractible in the sphere is directly tied to the non-triviality of the second relative homotopy group $\pi_2(S^2, S^1)$. [@problem_id:1687539]

A more subtle example is the inclusion of the boundary circle $\partial M$ into a Möbius strip $M$. The fundamental group of both the boundary and the strip itself is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. However, a loop that traverses the boundary once corresponds to a path that goes around the central core of the strip twice. The [induced homomorphism](@entry_id:149311) $i_*: \pi_1(\partial M) \to \pi_1(M)$ is therefore multiplication by 2. The kernel of this map is trivial. The [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) for $(M, \partial M)$ connects this algebraic fact to the [relative homotopy groups](@entry_id:261406) of the pair. [@problem_id:1687549]

This principle can also be used to perform explicit calculations. Consider the pair $(\mathbb{R}P^2, \mathbb{R}P^1)$, where the real projective line $\mathbb{R}P^1 \cong S^1$ is embedded in the real projective plane. The relevant segment of the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) is:
$$ \dots \to \pi_2(\mathbb{R}P^2, \mathbb{R}P^1) \xrightarrow{\partial_2} \pi_1(\mathbb{R}P^1) \xrightarrow{i_*} \pi_1(\mathbb{R}P^2) \to \dots $$
We know $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}P^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ and $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}P^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$. The map $i_*$ corresponds to the [quotient map](@entry_id:140877) from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, which sends an integer $k$ to its value modulo 2. The kernel of this map is the subgroup of even integers, $2\mathbb{Z}$. By [exactness](@entry_id:268999), this must be the image of the [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713): $\text{Im}(\partial_2) = \ker(i_*) = 2\mathbb{Z}$. [@problem_id:1687547]

### Applications in Cellular Homotopy Theory

CW complexes are spaces built iteratively by attaching cells (disks) of increasing dimension. The [long exact sequence of a pair](@entry_id:158857) is the indispensable tool for understanding how the homotopy groups of a space change as new cells are attached.

Let $X$ be a space formed by attaching an $n$-dimensional cell $D^n$ to a space $A$ along a map $f: S^{n-1} \to A$. We can study the effect of this attachment by considering the pair $(X, A)$. A key result, often proven using excision and the long exact sequence, states that for such a CW pair, the relative homotopy group $\pi_k(X,A)$ is determined by the cells of dimension $k$ in $X \setminus A$. When a single $n$-cell is attached, we find that $\pi_n(X, A) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, and $\pi_k(X,A)$ is trivial for $k \neq n$. [@problem_id:1687521]

This fact has a profound consequence for the homotopy groups of the resulting space $X$. Consider the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) for the pair $(X, A)$:
$$ \dots \to \pi_k(A) \xrightarrow{i_*} \pi_k(X) \to \pi_k(X, A) \to \dots $$
Suppose we attach a $k$-cell to a space $Y$. This creates a new space $Z$. To see the effect on lower-dimensional homotopy groups, we look at the pair $(Z, Y)$ and its sequence. For any dimension $n  k-1$, we have both $n$ and $n+1$ being strictly less than $k$. The relative groups $\pi_n(Z, Y)$ and $\pi_{n+1}(Z, Y)$ are therefore trivial. The segment of the long exact sequence becomes:
$$ \dots \to \pi_{n+1}(Z,Y) \to \pi_n(Y) \xrightarrow{i_*} \pi_n(Z) \to \pi_n(Z,Y) \to \dots $$
Substituting the trivial groups, we get:
$$ \dots \to 0 \to \pi_n(Y) \xrightarrow{i_*} \pi_n(Z) \to 0 \to \dots $$
Exactness implies that $i_*$ is an isomorphism for all $n  k-1$. This establishes the fundamental principle of [cellular approximation](@entry_id:275369): attaching a $k$-cell does not alter the homotopy groups in dimensions below $k-1$. For example, attaching a 6-cell to the 2-sphere $S^2$ does not change any of its homotopy groups $\pi_n$ for $n  5$. [@problem_id:1654143]

### Generalizations and Deeper Connections

The [long exact sequence of a pair](@entry_id:158857) is a prototype for a host of powerful algebraic structures in topology. Its framework can be generalized and is deeply intertwined with other core concepts.

#### The Long Exact Sequence of a Triple

Given a triple of spaces $B \subset A \subset X$, there is a natural interplay between the long [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) of the pairs $(X,A)$, $(A,B)$, and $(X,B)$. This relationship is formalized in the *long exact sequence of the triple* $(X,A,B)$:
$$ \dots \to \pi_n(A, B) \to \pi_n(X, B) \to \pi_n(X, A) \xrightarrow{\Delta_n} \pi_{n-1}(A, B) \to \dots $$
This sequence relates the relative groups of the three pairs. Its [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713), $\Delta_n$, is itself constructed from the maps of the underlying pair sequences. Specifically, it is the composition of the boundary map $\partial_n^{(XA)}: \pi_n(X, A) \to \pi_{n-1}(A)$ from the $(X,A)$ sequence, followed by the map $q_{n-1}: \pi_{n-1}(A) \to \pi_{n-1}(A, B)$ from the $(A,B)$ sequence. This construction showcases how the machinery of long [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) can be layered to analyze more complex spatial hierarchies. [@problem_id:1687528] This framework, combined with the Five-Lemma, yields powerful excision-type theorems. For instance, if the inclusion $B \hookrightarrow A$ is a homotopy equivalence, the long [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) for $(X,A)$ and $(X,B)$ can be arranged into a commutative ladder. The Five-Lemma then implies that the inclusion-[induced map](@entry_id:271712) on relative groups, $\pi_n(X,B) \to \pi_n(X,A)$, is an isomorphism for all $n$. [@problem_id:1687526]

#### The Path Space Fibration and Loop Spaces

The long exact sequence is a special case of the [long exact sequence of a fibration](@entry_id:161359). A key example is the [path space fibration](@entry_id:161224). For any based space $(X, x_0)$, the space $PX$ of paths starting at $x_0$ is contractible. The [loop space](@entry_id:160867) $\Omega X$ is the subspace of $PX$ consisting of paths that also end at $x_0$. Considering the pair $(PX, \Omega X)$, the long exact sequence provides profound insight. Since $PX$ is contractible, its absolute homotopy groups are trivial. The sequence for the pair $(PX, \Omega X)$ contains the segment:
$$ \dots \to \pi_n(PX) \to \pi_n(PX, \Omega X) \xrightarrow{\partial} \pi_{n-1}(\Omega X) \to \pi_{n-1}(PX) \to \dots $$
This simplifies to $0 \to \pi_n(PX, \Omega X) \xrightarrow{\partial} \pi_{n-1}(\Omega X) \to 0$, giving an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127) $\pi_n(PX, \Omega X) \cong \pi_{n-1}(\Omega X)$. Separately, the [evaluation map](@entry_id:149774) $p: PX \to X$ defined by $p(\gamma)=\gamma(1)$ is a fibration with fiber $\Omega X$. The long exact sequence of this [fibration](@entry_id:162085), together with the contractibility of $PX$, establishes one of the most fundamental relations in homotopy theory: $\pi_k(X) \cong \pi_{k-1}(\Omega X)$ for $k \ge 1$. Combining these results gives a beautiful identification:
$$ \pi_n(PX, \Omega X) \cong \pi_n(X) $$
This connects the relative homotopy of the path-loop pair directly back to the absolute homotopy of the original space. [@problem_id:1687542]

#### From Pointed Sets to Groups

For $n \ge 2$, the relative homotopy set $\pi_n(X,A,x_0)$ has a natural group structure, and for $n \ge 3$, this group is abelian. For $n=1$, $\pi_1(X,A,x_0)$ is generally only a pointed set. The [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) still exists at these low dimensions, but must be interpreted as a sequence of pointed sets. Exactness at a set $S$ in a sequence $S_1 \xrightarrow{f} S \xrightarrow{g} S_2$ means that the image of $f$ is precisely the fiber of $g$ over the basepoint of $S_2$.

This can lead to interesting results for subspaces that are not path-connected. Consider the circle $S^1$ with the discrete two-point subspace $A = \{1, -1\}$. The end of the long exact sequence for the pair $(S^1, A)$ with basepoint $1$ is:
$$ \pi_1(A,1) \to \pi_1(S^1,1) \to \pi_1(S^1,A,1) \xrightarrow{\partial} \pi_0(A) \to \pi_0(S^1) $$
Here, $\pi_1(A,1)$ is trivial, $\pi_1(S^1,1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $\pi_0(A)$ is the two-point set $\{1, -1\}$, and $\pi_0(S^1)$ is a single point. Exactness implies that $\partial$ is surjective, and that the fiber of $\partial$ over the basepoint $1 \in \pi_0(A)$ is the image of $\pi_1(S^1,1)$, which is a set in [bijection](@entry_id:138092) with $\mathbb{Z}$. Since $\partial$ is surjective, the set $\pi_1(S^1, A, 1)$ must have at least two path components, one mapping to $1$ and one mapping to $-1$. In fact, the set $\pi_1(S^1,A,1)$ is the disjoint union of the fibers over $1$ and $-1$. Each fiber is a torsor for $\pi_1(S^1,1)$, and is therefore in [bijection](@entry_id:138092) with $\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, as a set, $\pi_1(S^1,A,1)$ is bijective to the disjoint union $\mathbb{Z} \sqcup \mathbb{Z}$. [@problem_id:1687545]

#### The Bridge to Homology: The Relative Hurewicz Theorem

Finally, the [long exact sequence of a pair](@entry_id:158857) in homotopy theory has a direct analogue in [singular homology](@entry_id:158380) theory. The two sequences are linked by the Hurewicz homomorphism, which provides a bridge between the two fundamental invariants of a space. This connection is made precise by the Relative Hurewicz Theorem, which states that if a pair $(X,A)$ is $(n-1)$-connected for $n \ge 2$, then the relative Hurewicz map $h_n^{\text{rel}}: \pi_n(X,A) \to H_n(X,A)$ is an isomorphism.

This theorem ensures that under certain connectivity conditions, the long [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) of homotopy and homology are intimately related. Specifically, there is a commutative diagram relating the boundary homomorphisms:
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\pi_{n}(X,A)  \xrightarrow{\partial}  \pi_{n-1}(A) \\
\downarrow h_{n}^{\text{rel}}   \downarrow h_{n-1} \\
H_{n}(X,A)  \xrightarrow{\partial_{*}}  H_{n-1}(A)
\end{array}
$$
If the connectivity assumptions are met such that the vertical maps are isomorphisms, this diagram allows one to compute the homotopy boundary map $\partial$ by translating the problem into the often more computable realm of homology. For a 2-connected pair $(X,A)$ with $A$ simply connected, both $h_3^{\text{rel}}$ and $h_2$ are isomorphisms. The [commutativity](@entry_id:140240) of the diagram then implies that for any class $[\alpha] \in \pi_3(X,A)$, its image under the boundary map can be expressed as:
$$ \partial([\alpha]) = (h_2(A))^{-1}(\partial_*(h_3^{\text{rel}}(X,A)([\alpha]))) $$
This remarkable formula shows that the geometric operation of taking the boundary of a relative 3-sphere can be understood entirely through the algebraic machinery of homology and the Hurewicz isomorphisms. It is a testament to the deep, unifying power of [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) in modern mathematics. [@problem_id:1688800]
