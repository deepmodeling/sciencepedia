The relationship is given by $p_k(F) = (-1)^k c_{2k}(F_{\\mathbb{C}})$. For the first Pontryagin class ($k=1$), this is:\n$$p_1(\\text{ad}(P)) = -c_2(\\text{ad}(P)_{\\mathbb{C}})$$\n\nThe Lie algebra of $SU(3)$, denoted $\\mathfrak{su}(3)$, consists of $3 \\times 3$ skew-hermitian matrices with trace zero. Its complexification is the Lie algebra of the Special Linear Group $SL(3, \\mathbb{C})$, denoted $\\mathfrak{sl}(3, \\mathbb{C})$, which consists of all $3 \\times 3$ complex matrices with trace zero. That is, $\\mathfrak{su}(3) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathbb{C} \\cong \\mathfrak{sl}(3, \\mathbb{C})$.\nThis implies that the complexification of the real adjoint bundle $\\text{ad}(P)$ is the complex vector bundle associated to the adjoint representation of $SU(3)$ on $\\mathfrak{sl}(3, \\mathbb{C})$. Let's denote this complex bundle by $\\text{ad}_{\\mathbb{C}}(P)$. So, $\\text{ad}(P)_{\\mathbb{C}} \\cong \\text{ad}_{\\mathbb{C}}(P)$. The problem is now reduced to finding $-c_2(\\text{ad}_{\\mathbb{C}}(P))$.\n\nTo do this, we relate $\\text{ad}_{\\mathbb{C}}(P)$ to the defining bundle $E$. The space of all $3 \\times 3$ complex matrices can be identified with the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{gl}(3, \\mathbb{C})$, which decomposes into the trace part (scalar matrices) and the traceless part ($\\mathfrak{sl}(3, \\mathbb{C})$): $\\mathfrak{gl}(3, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong \\mathfrak{sl}(3, \\mathbb{C}) \\oplus \\mathbb{C}$. As representations of $SU(3)$, $\\mathbb{C}$ is the trivial 1-dimensional representation.\nAt the vector bundle level, this corresponds to a decomposition. The bundle of endomorphisms of $E$, denoted $\\text{End}(E)$, is associated with the representation of $SU(3)$ on $\\mathfrak{gl}(3, \\mathbb{C})$. Therefore, we have the following isomorphism of vector bundles:\n$$\\text{End}(E) \\cong \\text{ad}_{\\mathbb{C}}(P) \\oplus \\mathcal{O}$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{O}$ is the trivial complex line bundle over $M$.\n\nThe total Chern class is multiplicative with respect to direct sums of vector bundles. Thus, the total Chern class of $\\text{End}(E)$ is given by:\n$$c(\\text{End}(E)) = c(\\text{ad}_{\\mathbb{C}}(P) \\oplus \\mathcal{O}) = c(\\text{ad}_{\\mathbb{C}}(P)) \\cdot c(\\mathcal{O})$$\nSince $\\mathcal{O}$ is a trivial bundle, all its positive-degree Chern classes are zero, so its total Chern class is $c(\\mathcal{O}) = 1$. This implies that $c(\\text{End}(E)) = c(\\text{ad}_{\\mathbb{C}}(P))$. Consequently, for any $k \\ge 1$:\n$$c_k(\\text{End}(E)) = c_k(\\text{ad}_{\\mathbb{C}}(P))$$\nOur task now is to compute $c_2(\\text{End}(E))$. The bundle $\\text{End}(E)$ is isomorphic to $E \\otimes E^*$, where $E^*$ is the dual bundle of $E$.\n\nWe use the Chern character, which is a ring homomorphism $ch: K(M) \\to H^{\\text{even}}(M, \\mathbb{Q})$. A key property is its behavior with respect to tensor products: $ch(V \\otimes W) = ch(V) \\cdot ch(W)$. Thus:\n$$ch(\\text{End}(E)) = ch(E \\otimes E^*) = ch(E) \\cdot ch(E^*)$$\nThe Chern character of a bundle $V$ is related to its Chern classes by $ch(V) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\text{rank}(V)} ch_k(V)$, where $ch_k(V)$ is a polynomial in the Chern classes $c_j(V)$. The first few terms are:\n$ch_0(V) = \\text{rank}(V)$\n$ch_1(V) = c_1(V)$\n$ch_2(V) = \\frac{1}{2}(c_1(V)^2 - 2c_2(V))$\n\nFor the bundle $E$, which is associated to a principal $SU(3)$-bundle, its determinant bundle is trivial. This implies that the first Chern class is zero: $c_1(E)=0$.\nThe Chern character of $E$ (rank 3) is:\n$ch_0(E) = 3$\n$ch_1(E) = c_1(E) = 0$\n$ch_2(E) = \\frac{1}{2}(c_1(E)^2 - 2c_2(E)) = -c_2(E)$\nSo, $ch(E) = 3 - c_2(E) + (\\text{higher degree terms})$.\n\nFor the dual bundle $E^*$, the Chern roots are the negatives of the Chern roots of $E$. Since $c_1(E)=0$, it follows that $c_1(E^*) = -c_1(E) = 0$ and $c_2(E^*) = c_2(E)$. The Chern character for $E^*$ is therefore calculated as follows:\n$ch_0(E^*) = 3$\n$ch_1(E^*) = c_1(E^*) = 0$\n$ch_2(E^*) = \\frac{1}{2}(c_1(E^*)^2 - 2c_2(E^*)) = -c_2(E^*) = -c_2(E)$.\nSo, $ch(E^*) = 3 - c_2(E) + (\\text{higher degree terms})$.\n\nNow we compute the Chern character of $\\text{End}(E) = E \\otimes E^*$:\n$$ch(\\text{End}(E)) = ch(E) \\cdot ch(E^*) = (3 - c_2(E) + \\dots) \\cdot (3 - c_2(E) + \\dots)$$\nWe are interested in $ch_2(\\text{End}(E))$, which is the component in $H^4(M, \\mathbb{Q})$. Using the rule $ch_k(V \\otimes W) = \\sum_{i+j=k} ch_i(V)ch_j(W)$:\n$$ch_2(\\text{End}(E)) = ch_0(E)ch_2(E^*) + ch_1(E)ch_1(E^*) + ch_2(E)ch_0(E^*)$$\n$$ch_2(\\text{End}(E)) = 3(-c_2(E)) + (0)(0) + (-c_2(E))(3) = -6c_2(E)$$\nNow we relate this back to the Chern classes of $\\text{End}(E)$.\nFirst, we find $c_1(\\text{End}(E))$:\n$c_1(\\text{End}(E)) = c_1(E \\otimes E^*) = \\text{rank}(E^*)c_1(E) + \\text{rank}(E)c_1(E^*) = 3(0) + 3(0)=0$.\nSince $c_1(\\text{End}(E))=0$, the relation for $ch_2$ simplifies:\n$$ch_2(\\text{End}(E)) = \\frac{1}{2}(c_1(\\text{End}(E))^2 - 2c_2(\\text{End}(E))) = -c_2(\\text{End}(E))$$\nComparing our two expressions for $ch_2(\\text{End}(E))$:\n$$-c_2(\\text{End}(E)) = -6c_2(E) \\implies c_2(\\text{End}(E)) = 6c_2(E)$$\nAs established earlier, $c_2(\\text{ad}_{\\mathbb{C}}(P)) = c_2(\\text{End}(E))$. Therefore:\n$$c_2(\\text{ad}_{\\mathbb{C}}(P)) = 6c_2(E)$$\nFinally, we substitute this into the formula for the first Pontryagin class:\n$$p_1(\\text{ad}(P)) = -c_2(\\text{ad}(P)_{\\mathbb{C}}) = -c_2(\\text{ad}_{\\mathbb{C}}(P)) = -6c_2(E)$$\nThe first Pontryagin class of the adjoint bundle is $-6$ times the second Chern class of the defining bundle.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-6c_{2}(E)}$$", "id": "1666529"}]}
