The statement is: \"The Klein bottle ($K$) can be realized as the boundary of a compact 3-manifold.\" The problem explicitly states that the Klein bottle ($K$) is a non-orientable manifold.

Let's first evaluate the claim about orientability. The problem states that $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is non-orientable.

Since $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is non-orientable, their connected sum $\\mathbb{R}P^2 \\# \\mathbb{R}P^2$ must also be non-orientable. Thus, the claim that it \"is an orientable manifold\" is false.

The statement is: \"There exists a compact 3-manifold $W$ such that its boundary $\\partial W$ is the connected sum of a torus and a real projective plane, $T^2 \\# \\mathbb{R}P^2$.\" This is equivalent to claiming that the manifold $M = T^2 \\# \\mathbb{R}P^2$ can serve as a boundary. Let's determine the orientability of $M$. We are given that the 2-torus $T^2$ is orientable and the real projective plane $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is non-orientable. Using the provided rule for connected sums, the manifold $M = T^2 \\# \\mathbb{R}P^2$ is non-orientable.

The theorem does not forbid an orientable manifold from being a boundary. In fact, orientable manifolds can often be boundaries. A standard example is the solid torus, which is a compact 3-manifold whose boundary is the 2-torus $T^2$. So, the first part of the statement, \"$T^2$ cannot be the boundary...\", is false.
