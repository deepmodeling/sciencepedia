For a non-orientable manifold like a Möbius strip, attempting to parallel transport a normal vector around certain closed loops results in the vector pointing in the opposite direction upon returning to the start. This behavior can be resolved by considering the manifold's orientable double cover.\n\nLet a Möbius strip, $M$, be constructed from the rectangle $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [-1, 1]$ by identifying the points $(0, v)$ with $(2\\pi, -v)$ for all $v \\in [-1, 1]$. We denote a point in $M$ by the equivalence class $[(u, v)]_M$ where $u \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThe orientable double cover of $M$ is a cylinder, $C$, which can be constructed from the rectangle $[0, 4\\pi] \\times [-1, 1]$ by identifying points $(0, v)$ with $(4\\pi, v)$.

This means the bottom edge (labeled $a$) is identified with the top edge (also labeled $a$), and the right edge (labeled $b$) is identified with the left edge (labeled $b^{-1}$, indicating opposite orientation).\n\nEvery non-orientable surface has an orientable double cover. This is an orientable surface $E$ that \"covers\" the original surface $K$ with a 2-to-1 projection map $p: E \\to K$. We can construct the fundamental polygon of $E$ by taking two copies of the fundamental polygon of $K$, which we will call $P_1$ and $P_2$, and determining how their edges should be glued together.\n\nThe rule for gluing is as follows: For any edge identification on the original polygon $P$ that reverses orientation, the corresponding lifted edges in the cover must be identified by swapping sheets. That is, the edge on $P_1$ is glued to the corresponding edge on $P_2$.
