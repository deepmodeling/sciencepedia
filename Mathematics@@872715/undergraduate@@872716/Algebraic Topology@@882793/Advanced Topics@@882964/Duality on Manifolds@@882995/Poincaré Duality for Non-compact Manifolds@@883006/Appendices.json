This problem asks you to calculate the integral pairing between a closed $1$-form and an exact $1$-form with compact support on the punctured plane, a quintessential non-compact manifold.

We are given definitions for the 1-forms $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. We can solve this problem in two ways: by a direct integration in polar coordinates, or by using Stokes' theorem.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Integration**\n\nFirst, let's identify the forms $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in a convenient coordinate system. Polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ are well-suited for this problem, where $x = r\\cos\\theta$ and $y = r\\sin\\theta$.\n\nThe 1-form $\\alpha$ is closed ($d\\alpha=0$) and its integral over the counter-clockwise unit circle $S^1$ is 1. The standard 1-form on $M$ representing the generator of the first de Rham cohomology group $H^1(M)$ is $\\frac{-y dx + x dy}{x^2+y^2}$. In polar coordinates, this form is $d\\theta$. The integral of $d\\theta$ around the origin is $\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi$. To meet the normalization condition $\\int_{S^1} \\alpha = 1$, we must have:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{-y dx + x dy}{x^2+y^2} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} d\\theta $$\n\nNext, let's find the form $\\beta = d\\eta$. The function $\\eta$ is given by $\\eta(x,y) = g(r)$ where $r=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. Using the chain rule, its exterior derivative is:\n$$ \\beta = d(g(r)) = g'(r) dr $$\nwhere $g'(r)$ is the derivative of $g$ with respect to $r$. From the properties of $g(r)$, we know that $g'(r)=0$ for $r \\notin (1,2)$. This implies that the support of $\\beta$ is the compact annulus $\\{ (x,y) : 1 \\le r \\le 2 \\}$.\n\nNow we compute the wedge product $\\alpha \\wedge \\beta$:\n$$ \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\wedge (g'(r) dr) = \\frac{g'(r)}{2\\pi} d\\theta \\wedge dr $$\nTo integrate this 2-form over $M$, we must express it in terms of the standard area element. The standard orientation of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is given by $dx \\wedge dy$. In polar coordinates, the area element is $dx \\wedge dy = r dr \\wedge d\\theta$.\nWe have $d\\theta \\wedge dr = -dr \\wedge d\\theta$. Therefore, $dr \\wedge d\\theta = -\\frac{1}{r} dx \\wedge dy$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for the wedge product:\n$$ \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = \\frac{g'(r)}{2\\pi} (- dr \\wedge d\\theta) = -\\frac{g'(r)}{2\\pi r} dx \\wedge dy $$\nThe integral over $M$ is then:\n$$ \\int_M \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = \\int_M -\\frac{g'(r)}{2\\pi r} dx \\wedge dy $$\nWe can evaluate this integral using polar coordinates, where $dx \\wedge dy$ is replaced by the integration measure $r dr d\\theta$:\n$$ \\int_M \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty \\left(-\\frac{g'(r)}{2\\pi r}\\right) r dr d\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty -\\frac{g'(r)}{2\\pi} dr d\\theta $$\nLet's evaluate the inner integral with respect to $r$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty g'(r) dr = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} g(R) - \\lim_{r \\to 0^+} g(r) $$\nUsing the given properties of $g(r)$, we have $g(r) = 7$ for $r \\ge 2$ (so the limit at infinity is 7) and $g(r) = 0$ for $r \\le 1$ (so the limit at 0 is 0).\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty g'(r) dr = 7 - 0 = 7 $$\nSubstituting this back into the full integral:\n$$ \\int_M \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} -\\frac{7}{2\\pi} d\\theta = -\\frac{7}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta = -\\frac{7}{2\\pi} (2\\pi) = -7 $$\n\n**Method 2: Using Stokes' Theorem**\n\nWe want to calculate $\\int_M \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = \\int_M \\alpha \\wedge d\\eta$.\nSince $\\alpha$ and $d\\eta$ are both 1-forms, their wedge product is anticommutative: $\\alpha \\wedge d\\eta = -d\\eta \\wedge \\alpha$.\nThe exterior derivative of the 1-form $\\eta\\alpha$ is given by the product rule $d(\\eta\\alpha) = d\\eta \\wedge \\alpha + \\eta d\\alpha$. Since $\\alpha$ is closed, $d\\alpha=0$. Thus, $d(\\eta\\alpha) = d\\eta \\wedge \\alpha$.\nCombining these facts, we get:\n$$ \\alpha \\wedge d\\eta = -d\\eta \\wedge \\alpha = -d(\\eta\\alpha) $$\nSo the integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_M \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = -\\int_M d(\\eta\\alpha) $$\nThe 1-form $\\eta\\alpha$ is not compactly supported, because for $r \\ge 2$, $\\eta=7$ and $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}d\\theta$, so $\\eta\\alpha$ is non-zero for arbitrarily large $r$. Therefore, we cannot directly apply Stokes' theorem for forms with compact support.\nInstead, we consider an exhausting sequence of compact submanifolds with boundary. Let $A_{\\epsilon,R}$ be the annulus defined by $\\{ (x,y) : \\epsilon \\le \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\le R \\}$ for $0 < \\epsilon < R$. Then $M = \\bigcup_{\\epsilon \\to 0, R \\to \\infty} A_{\\epsilon,R}$.\n$$ \\int_M d(\\eta\\alpha) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0, R \\to \\infty} \\int_{A_{\\epsilon,R}} d(\\eta\\alpha) $$\nBy Stokes' theorem, $\\int_{A_{\\epsilon,R}} d(\\eta\\alpha) = \\int_{\\partial A_{\\epsilon,R}} \\eta\\alpha$. The boundary $\\partial A_{\\epsilon,R}$ consists of two circles, one of radius $R$ ($C_R$) and one of radius $\\epsilon$ ($C_\\epsilon$). The induced orientation is counter-clockwise on the outer boundary $C_R$ and clockwise on the inner boundary $C_\\epsilon$. Thus:\n$$ \\int_{\\partial A_{\\epsilon,R}} \\eta\\alpha = \\int_{C_R, \\text{ccw}} \\eta\\alpha + \\int_{C_\\epsilon, \\text{cw}} \\eta\\alpha = \\int_{C_R, \\text{ccw}} \\eta\\alpha - \\int_{C_\\epsilon, \\text{ccw}} \\eta\\alpha $$\nWe choose $R > 2$ and $\\epsilon < 1$.\nFor any point on $C_R$, the radius is $R \\ge 2$, so $\\eta=g(R)=7$.\nFor any point on $C_\\epsilon$, the radius is $\\epsilon \\le 1$, so $\\eta=g(\\epsilon)=0$.\nThe integrals become:\n$$ \\int_{C_R, \\text{ccw}} \\eta\\alpha = \\int_{C_R, \\text{ccw}} 7\\alpha = 7 \\int_{C_R, \\text{ccw}} \\alpha $$\n$$ \\int_{C_\\epsilon, \\text{ccw}} \\eta\\alpha = \\int_{C_\\epsilon, \\text{ccw}} 0 \\cdot \\alpha = 0 $$\nBy the homology invariance of de Rham cohomology, the integral of the closed form $\\alpha$ over any circle centered at the origin is the same. Since $\\int_{S^1} \\alpha = 1$, we have $\\int_{C_R} \\alpha = 1$.\nTherefore, $\\int_{C_R, \\text{ccw}} \\eta\\alpha = 7 \\cdot 1 = 7$.\nThe integral over the boundary is $7 - 0 = 7$. Taking the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$ and $R \\to \\infty$ does not change this value.\nFinally, we substitute this back into our original expression:\n$$ \\int_M \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = -\\int_M d(\\eta\\alpha) = -7 $$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The fact that this integral is non-zero is a key feature of the cohomology of non-compact manifolds.
