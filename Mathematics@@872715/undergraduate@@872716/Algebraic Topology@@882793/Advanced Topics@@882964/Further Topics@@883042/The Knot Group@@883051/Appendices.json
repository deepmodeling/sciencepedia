The procedure is as follows:\n1.  Assign a distinct generator to each arc of the diagram. An arc is defined as a continuous segment of the strand that runs from one undercrossing to the next undercrossing along the path of the strand.\n2.  At each crossing, a relation between the generators is established.

If $w=1$, then $a$ and $b$ commute, so the group would be abelian. In an abelian group the defining relator simplifies as follows:\n$$bab^{-1}ab=aba^{-1}ba \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad a^{2}b=b^{2}a.$$\nIn an abelian group, this is equivalent to\n$$a^{2}b=b^{2}a \\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\; a^{2}ba^{-1}b^{-2}=1 \\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\; ab^{-1}=1 \\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\; a=b.$$\nThus, under the assumption that $a$ and $b$ commute, the relator forces $a=b$, and the group would be isomorphic to $\\langle a\\rangle\\cong\\mathbb{Z}$. However, it is a standard fact that the figure-eight knot complement admits a complete finite-volume hyperbolic structure, so its fundamental group $G_{8}$ embeds as a discrete, nonabelian subgroup of $\\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbb{C})$ (its holonomy representation). Hence $G_{8}$ is nonabelian, and therefore $w=[a,b]\\neq 1$. This rules out option A.\n\nNext, we determine whether $w$ could have finite order. A general theorem in 3-manifold topology states that knot groups are torsion-free: for any knot $K\\subset S^{3}$, the group $\\pi_{1}(S^{3}\\setminus K)$ has no nontrivial elements of finite order. In particular, for the figure-eight knot, $G_{8}$ is torsion-free. Since we have already established that $w$ is nontrivial, torsion-freeness implies that the order of $w$ cannot be finite. Therefore $w$ has infinite order. This establishes option B and rules out option C.\n\nFinally, the order of an element of a group is an intrinsic property of that element in the group and does not depend on the choice of generators or presentation. Hence option D is false.\n\nCombining these conclusions, the correct statement is that $w$ represents an element of infinite order in $G_{8}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1685987"}]}
