## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the algebraic machinery of the long exact sequence in cohomology. While this framework is elegant in its own right, its true power is revealed when it is applied to concrete geometric problems. This chapter explores the versatility and utility of the long exact sequence as a primary computational tool in algebraic topology and its connections to other areas of mathematics, including [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818), manifold theory, and [knot theory](@entry_id:141161). We will see how this single algebraic device, in its various forms, allows for the computation of [cohomology groups](@entry_id:142450) for a vast array of spaces, reveals deep structural theorems, and uncovers connections between seemingly disparate mathematical objects. Our focus will shift from the construction of the sequence to its strategic application, demonstrating how to deconstruct complex topological questions into manageable algebraic steps.

### The Long Exact Sequence of a Pair

The most fundamental form of the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) arises from a pair of spaces $(X, A)$, where $A$ is a subspace of $X$. This sequence links the cohomology of $X$, the cohomology of $A$, and the [relative cohomology](@entry_id:272456) of the pair, $H^*(X, A)$. This connection provides a powerful lever for computing one of these groups when the other two are known.

A canonical first application is the computation of the [relative cohomology](@entry_id:272456) groups of an $n$-disk $D^n$ relative to its boundary sphere $S^{n-1}$. The disk $D^n$ is contractible, so its higher [cohomology groups](@entry_id:142450) vanish, $H^k(D^n; G) = 0$ for $k > 0$. The cohomology of the sphere $S^{n-1}$ is also well-known. Plugging these facts into the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) for the pair $(D^n, S^{n-1})$ reveals a remarkable [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127). For any $k \ge 2$, the segment of the sequence
$$ \cdots \to H^{k-1}(D^n; G) \to H^{k-1}(S^{n-1}; G) \to H^k(D^n, S^{n-1}; G) \to H^k(D^n; G) \to \cdots $$
simplifies to
$$ \cdots \to 0 \to H^{k-1}(S^{n-1}; G) \xrightarrow{\delta} H^k(D^n, S^{n-1}; G) \to 0 \to \cdots $$
This forces the [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713) $\delta$ to be an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127). In particular, for $k=n \ge 2$, we find $H^n(D^n, S^{n-1}; G) \cong H^{n-1}(S^{n-1}; G) \cong G$. A slightly more detailed analysis for the case $n=1$ confirms this result holds for all $n \ge 1$. This computation is a cornerstone of [cohomology theory](@entry_id:270863), forming a key step in many inductive proofs, including the calculation of the [cohomology of spheres](@entry_id:636700) and the proof of the Brouwer [fixed-point theorem](@entry_id:143811). A similar, straightforward application of the sequence for the pair $(S^n, A)$, where $A$ consists of two distinct points, allows for the computation of $H^k(S^n, A; \mathbb{Z})$, revealing non-trivial [relative cohomology](@entry_id:272456) groups in dimensions $1$ and $n$ for $n \ge 2$.

Beyond basic computations, the long exact sequence for a pair is an indispensable tool in understanding the structure of manifolds and CW-complexes. For instance, the cohomology of [real projective space](@entry_id:149094), $\mathbb{R}P^n$, can be determined inductively. Viewing $\mathbb{R}P^{n-1}$ as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}P^n$, we can study the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) for the pair $(\mathbb{R}P^n, \mathbb{R}P^{n-1})$. A crucial geometric fact is that the quotient space $\mathbb{R}P^n / \mathbb{R}P^{n-1}$ is homeomorphic to the $n$-sphere $S^n$. For such "good pairs," the [relative cohomology](@entry_id:272456) is isomorphic to the [reduced cohomology](@entry_id:268050) of the quotient, $H^k(\mathbb{R}P^n, \mathbb{R}P^{n-1}; G) \cong \tilde{H}^k(S^n; G)$. Using this isomorphism and the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438), one can relate the cohomology of $\mathbb{R}P^n$ to that of $\mathbb{R}P^{n-1}$. This inductive strategy, particularly with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, reveals that $H^k(\mathbb{R}P^n; \mathbb{Z}_2) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$ for $0 \le k \le n$ and is zero otherwise. Further analysis of the [cup product](@entry_id:159554) structure shows that the [cohomology ring](@entry_id:160158) is a truncated polynomial algebra: $H^*(\mathbb{R}P^n; \mathbb{Z}_2) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2[\alpha]/(\alpha^{n+1})$, where $\alpha$ is a generator in degree 1.

Another fundamental construction in topology is the [mapping cone](@entry_id:261103), $C_f$, of a map $f: X \to Y$. The long exact sequence for the pair $(C_f, Y)$ provides a powerful tool for calculating the cohomology of $C_f$. For a map $f: S^n \to S^n$ of degree $d$, the sequence for the pair $(C_f, S^n)$ relates the unknown cohomology of $C_f$ to the known [cohomology of spheres](@entry_id:636700). The [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713) in this sequence is identified with multiplication by the degree $d$. This leads to the elegant result that the [reduced cohomology](@entry_id:268050) of the [mapping cone](@entry_id:261103) is trivial except for $\tilde{H}^{n+1}(C_f; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_d$, where $\mathbb{Z}_d$ is the [cyclic group](@entry_id:146728) of order $|d|$. This example lucidly demonstrates how topological information (the [degree of a map](@entry_id:158493)) is translated into algebraic information (torsion in a cohomology group) via the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438).

The sequence's utility extends deep into the theory of manifolds. In [surgery theory](@entry_id:161809), manifolds are modified by "attaching handles." Attaching a $k$-handle $H_k = D^k \times D^{n-k}$ to an $n$-manifold $M$ produces a new manifold $X = M \cup H_k$. The change in topology is precisely captured by the long exact sequence in homology (and dually, cohomology) for the pair $(X, M)$. The [relative homology groups](@entry_id:159711) $H_*(X, M)$ are determined by the handle, and the [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713) is determined by the [attaching map](@entry_id:153852). This allows for a precise calculation of the homology of the new manifold $X$ in terms of the homology of $M$ and the geometry of the attachment.

Perhaps one of the most profound roles of the [long exact sequence of a pair](@entry_id:158857) is in establishing duality theorems. For a compact $n$-manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$, Poincaré-Lefschetz duality relates the cohomology of $M$ to the homology of the pair $(M, \partial M)$. The long exact sequence for $(M, \partial M)$ is the central algebraic tool in the proof of this theorem. It connects the absolute cohomology of $M$ and $\partial M$ to the relative groups that appear in the duality statement. In the case of non-orientable manifolds, using coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ recovers a version of duality. For example, by analyzing the sequence for a punctured Klein bottle $M$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, one can explicitly compute the relative groups $H^*(M, \partial M; \mathbb{Z}_2)$ and verify their relationship to the absolute groups, illustrating the mechanics of duality.

### The Mayer-Vietoris Sequence: A "Cut and Paste" Principle

When a space $X$ can be decomposed into the union of two open subsets, $X = U \cup V$, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence provides an algebraic tool for computing the cohomology of $X$ from the cohomology of $U$, $V$, and their intersection $U \cap V$. It functions as a powerful "cut and paste" or "divide and conquer" principle for cohomology.

The simplest applications involve computing the cohomology of spaces built by gluing together simpler ones. For instance, the [wedge sum](@entry_id:270607) of two 2-spheres, $X = S^2 \vee S^2$, can be covered by two open sets $U$ and $V$ that are each homotopy equivalent to $S^2$ and whose intersection is contractible. Since the cohomology of a contractible space is trivial in positive dimensions, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence simplifies greatly, leading to an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127) $H^k(X) \cong H^k(U) \oplus H^k(V)$ for $k \ge 2$. A careful analysis of the low-dimensional part of the sequence yields the complete cohomology of the [wedge sum](@entry_id:270607). A similar strategy applies to the torus $T^2$. By decomposing the torus into two overlapping open cylinders (each homotopy equivalent to $S^1$), the Mayer-Vietoris sequence allows for a step-by-step computation of the Betti numbers of the torus, recovering the well-known result $(b_0, b_1, b_2) = (1, 2, 1)$.

The Mayer-Vietoris sequence also finds powerful application in more advanced contexts, such as knot theory. A knot is an embedding of a circle $S^1$ into the 3-sphere $S^3$. The [knot complement](@entry_id:264989), the space $S^3$ with a tubular neighborhood of the knot removed, is a fundamental object of study. One can compute the cohomology of the [knot complement](@entry_id:264989) by viewing $S^3$ as the union of the [knot complement](@entry_id:264989) $X$ and a tubular neighborhood $N(K)$ of the knot. The intersection is the boundary of the neighborhood, a torus $T^2$. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence for this decomposition relates the known cohomology of $S^3$, $N(K) \simeq S^1$, and $T^2$ to the unknown cohomology of the [knot complement](@entry_id:264989) $X$. This procedure robustly shows that the first cohomology group of any [knot complement](@entry_id:264989), $H^1(X; \mathbb{Z})$, is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.

A far-reaching generalization of this idea is captured by Alexander Duality, which states that for a "well-behaved" compact subset $K \subset S^n$, there is an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127) $\tilde{H}^i(S^n \setminus K; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \tilde{H}_{n-i-1}(K; \mathbb{Z})$. The proof of this theorem is a masterful application of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. This duality allows one to compute the cohomology of a potentially complicated complement by instead computing the homology of the original (and often simpler) subspace $K$. As an example, one can compute the cohomology of the complement of a space $K$ formed by gluing two tori along a circle inside $S^4$. The computation proceeds in two stages, both employing long [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503): first, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence is used to find the homology of $K$, and then Alexander Duality is invoked to determine the cohomology of its complement.

The algebraic structure of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence is universal and appears in other cohomology theories. In the context of [smooth manifolds](@entry_id:160799) and differential geometry, de Rham cohomology provides an equivalent theory for real coefficients. For an open cover $M = U \cup V$, there is a Mayer-Vietoris sequence for de Rham cohomology. Here, the objects are spaces of differential forms. The proof of exactness and the construction of the [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713) $\delta$ can be made completely explicit using a partition of unity, a standard tool in [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818). This explicit construction, which produces a global closed $k$-form on $M$ from a closed $(k-1)$-form on $U \cap V$, beautifully illustrates the interplay between the [smooth structure](@entry_id:159394) of the manifold and its underlying topology.

### Further Long Exact Sequences: Coefficients and Fibrations

The algebraic pattern of a [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) is not limited to pairs of spaces or open covers. It arises whenever there is a [short exact sequence](@entry_id:137930) of cochain complexes. Two other fundamental sources for such sequences are short [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) of coefficient groups and [fibrations](@entry_id:156331).

Given a [short exact sequence](@entry_id:137930) of abelian groups, such as $0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$, there is an induced long exact sequence in the cohomology of any space $X$:
$$ \cdots \to H^k(X; A) \to H^k(X; B) \to H^k(X; C) \xrightarrow{\beta} H^{k+1}(X; A) \to \cdots $$
The [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713) $\beta$ is known as the Bockstein homomorphism. It provides a crucial link between [cohomology groups](@entry_id:142450) with different coefficients. The sequence for $0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{\times p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0$ relates integral cohomology to cohomology with mod $p$ coefficients. The Bockstein $\beta: H^k(X; \mathbb{Z}_p) \to H^{k+1}(X; \mathbb{Z})$ is instrumental in detecting $p$-torsion. For example, for the [real projective plane](@entry_id:150364) $X = \mathbb{R}P^2$, the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) associated with coefficients $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ shows that the Bockstein homomorphism $\beta: H^1(X; \mathbb{Z}_2) \to H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ is an isomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ to $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This demonstrates that the non-trivial class in $H^1(X; \mathbb{Z}_2)$ is directly responsible for the 2-torsion in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$.

Another rich source of long [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) is the theory of [fiber bundles](@entry_id:154670). For a [fibration](@entry_id:162085) $F \to E \to B$, where $F$ is the fiber, $E$ is the total space, and $B$ is the base space, there are powerful tools that relate the cohomology of these three spaces.
- **The Wang Sequence:** For the special case where the base space is a circle, $B=S^1$, the fibration is classified by a "monodromy" map $h: F \to F$. The resulting Wang [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) relates the cohomology of the total space $E$ to that of the fiber $F$ via a map involving the monodromy, $id - h^*$. This provides an effective method for computing the cohomology of mapping tori, which are canonical examples of such [fibrations](@entry_id:156331). For instance, the Betti numbers of the [3-manifold](@entry_id:193484) formed as the mapping torus of a Dehn twist on a 2-torus can be computed directly from the Wang sequence.
- **The Gysin Sequence:** For an orientable sphere bundle $S^{n-1} \to E \to B$, the Gysin sequence provides another powerful long exact sequence. This sequence is particularly remarkable because its [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713) is given by the cup product with a special [cohomology class](@entry_id:263961) $e \in H^n(B)$, called the Euler class of the bundle. This class captures the "twist" of the bundle. Knowing the Euler class and the cohomology of the base space allows one to compute the cohomology of the total space. For example, for an $S^3$-bundle over the space $S^2 \vee S^4$, the Gysin sequence allows a complete determination of the rank and torsion of the [cohomology groups](@entry_id:142450) of the total space, once the Euler class is specified.
- **Beyond to Spectral Sequences:** For a general [fibration](@entry_id:162085), the relationship between the cohomology of the base, fiber, and total space is more intricate and is captured by a more sophisticated algebraic tool: the Serre spectral sequence. This can be viewed as a generalization of a [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438), laid out on a two-dimensional grid. While a full treatment is beyond the scope of this text, it is the essential tool for computing the cohomology of many important spaces in geometry, such as the [homogeneous spaces](@entry_id:271488) $G/H$ that arise in the theory of Lie groups. For example, the cohomology of the Stiefel manifold $V_2(\mathbb{R}^4) = SO(4)/SO(2)$ can be determined by analyzing the spectral sequence of the associated fibration, providing a deep connection between algebraic topology and Lie theory.

In conclusion, the long exact sequence in cohomology is far more than a formal algebraic consequence. It is a dynamic and versatile tool that lies at the heart of computation and proof in modern geometry and topology. From determining the fundamental properties of spheres and [projective spaces](@entry_id:157963) to unlocking the invariants of [knots](@entry_id:637393) and manifolds, its applications are as diverse as they are profound.
