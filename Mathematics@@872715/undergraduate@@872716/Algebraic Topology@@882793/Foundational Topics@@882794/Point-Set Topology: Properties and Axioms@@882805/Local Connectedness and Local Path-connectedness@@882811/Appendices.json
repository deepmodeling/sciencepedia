Consider the projection onto the $x$-coordinate, $p:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ given by $p(x,y)=x$. Then $p\\circ\\gamma:[0,1]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is continuous as a composition of continuous maps, and its image lies in the discrete subset $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots\\}\\subset\\mathbb{R}$. Since the continuous image of a connected space is connected, and the only connected subsets of a discrete subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ are singletons, it follows that $p\\circ\\gamma$ is constant. Hence $\\gamma$ is contained entirely in some single $L_{n}$. Therefore no path connects points from distinct $L_{n}$, and each $L_{n}$ is a path component. Since there are countably many $n$, $X$ has countably many path components.\n\nStep 2: Show $X$ is not connected.\nFor each $n$, $L_{n}$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, hence $L_{n}=X\\cap L_{n}$ is closed in $X$. Moreover, $L_{n}$ is also open in $X$: for any $(n,y_{0})\\in L_{n}$, take any $r$ with $0<r<\\frac{1}{2}$; then $B((n,y_{0}),r)\\cap X\\subset L_{n}$ because any other $L_{m}$ with $m\\neq n$ has horizontal distance at least $1$. Thus $L_{n}$ is a union of such open neighborhoods, so it is open in $X$. Since $X$ is a disjoint union of at least two nonempty clopen sets, it is not connected.\n\nStep 3: Show $X$ is locally connected.\nFix $x=(n,y_{0})\\in X$ and let $U\\subset X$ be open with $x\\in U$. Since $X$ is a subspace of the metric space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, there exists $r>0$ such that $B(x,r)\\cap X\\subset U$. Define $V:=B(x,r)\\cap X$. Then $V$ is open in $X$ by construction. To see $V$ is connected, note that $V=L_{n}\\cap B(x,r)$, and the map $h:L_{n}\\to[0,1]$ given by $h((n,y))=y$ is a homeomorphism onto $[0,1]$. Under $h$, the set $V$ corresponds to an interval in $[0,1]$ (possibly of the form $(a,b)$, $[0,b)$, $(a,1]$, or $[0,1]$), all of which are connected in $\\mathbb{R}$. Hence $V$ is connected as the homeomorphic preimage of a connected set. Therefore, for every $x\\in X$ and every open $U\\ni x$, there is a connected open set $V$ with $x\\in V\\subset U$.
