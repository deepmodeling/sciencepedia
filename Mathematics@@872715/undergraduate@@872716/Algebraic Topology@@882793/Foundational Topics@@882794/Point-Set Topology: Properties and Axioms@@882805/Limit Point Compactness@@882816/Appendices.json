Thus, to derive a contradiction under the assumption that $L$ is metrizable, it suffices to show that $L$ is not compact; then $L$ would be compact by the metric theorem but not compact by an explicit argument, a contradiction.\n\nWe now show that $L$ is not compact. Consider the open cover of $L$ by the family\n$$\n\\mathcal{U}=\\{(-\\infty,\\alpha):\\alpha\\in L\\}.\n$$\nEach $(-\\infty,\\alpha)$ is subbasic open in the order topology, and for every $\\beta\\in L$, we have $\\beta\\in(-\\infty,\\beta+1)$ (using existence of the successor $\\beta+1$ in a well-order), so $\\mathcal{U}$ covers $L$.

Hence $\\mathcal{U}$ has no finite subcover, and $L$ is not compact.\n\nNow argue by contradiction: assume $L$ is metrizable. Since $L$ is given to be limit point compact and the metric theorem states that in metric spaces compactness is equivalent to limit point compactness, it would follow that $L$ is compact. This contradicts the previous paragraph. Therefore, $L$ is not metrizable. The key statement enabling this contradiction is that $L$ is not compact.\n\nFor completeness, note why the other options do not serve the intended purpose:\n- $L$ is Hausdorff in the order topology on a linear order, so A is false and not useful.\n- C (disconnectedness) does not contradict metrizability since many metric spaces are disconnected.\n- D (non-separability) does not contradict metrizability since there exist non-separable metric spaces.\n- E (not first-countable) does not apply here: in this construction, each $\\alpha\\in L$ has $P_{\\alpha}$ countable, yielding a countable local base at $\\alpha$ via intervals of the form $(\\beta,\\alpha+1)$ with $\\beta$ cofinal from below, so first countability does not fail. In any case, even if E were true, the given proof strategy via limit point compactness uses compactness, making B the correct step.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice to complete the proof is that $L$ is not a compact space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1660483"}]}
