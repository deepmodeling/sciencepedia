By the intermediate value theorem, $x([0,1])$ contains all real numbers between $k$ and $m$, but $S_{A}$ only contains points with $x$ equal to positive integers. Hence $\\gamma$ would leave $S_{A}$, a contradiction. Therefore points on distinct rays cannot be joined by a path in $S_{A}$, so $S_{A}$ is not path-connected.\n\nSet B. Each $R_{n}=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\mid y=\\frac{x}{n},\\ x\\ge 0\\}$ is path-connected, and all $R_{n}$ share the common point $(0,0)$ because $x=0$ gives $y=0$ for every $n$. General fact: if $\\{A_{i}\\}_{i\\in I}$ are path-connected subsets with a common point $q\\in\\bigcap_{i}A_{i}$, then $\\bigcup_{i}A_{i}$ is path-connected. Indeed, for $p\\in A_{i}$ and $r\\in A_{j}$, take paths in $A_{i}$ from $p$ to $q$ and in $A_{j}$ from $q$ to $r$, and concatenate. Applying this with $q=(0,0)$ shows $S_{B}$ is path-connected.\n\nSet C. Each $C_{n}=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\mid (x-n)^{2}+y^{2}=n^{2}\\}$ is a circle and thus path-connected. For $m\\neq n$, the intersection $C_{m}\\cap C_{n}$ is a single point. Subtracting the equations\n$$(x-n)^{2}+y^{2}=n^{2},\\quad (x-m)^{2}+y^{2}=m^{2}$$\ngives $2(m-n)x=0$, hence $x=0$ and then $y=0$, so $C_{m}\\cap C_{n}=\\{(0,0)\\}$. Thus all $C_{n}$ share the point $(0,0)$. By the same union-with-common-point argument as in Set B, $S_{C}$ is path-connected.\n\nSet D. Let $S_{D}=\\{(x,y)\\mid y=\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{x}),\\ 0<x\\le 1\\}\\cup\\{(x,y)\\mid x=0,\\ -1\\le y\\le 1\\}$. The graph part $\\{(x,\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{x})):\\ 0<x\\le 1\\}$ is path-connected as the continuous image of the path-connected interval $(0,1]$ under $x\\mapsto (x,\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{x}))$. The vertical segment $\\{(0,y): -1\\le y\\le 1\\}$ is also path-connected.

Define $t_{0}=\\inf\\{t\\in[0,1]: x(t)>0\\}$. Continuity of $x$ implies $x(t_{0})=0$ and $x(t)>0$ for all $t>t_{0}$ sufficiently close to $t_{0}$. For such $t$, since $\\gamma(t)\\in S_{D}$ and $x(t)>0$, we must have\n$$y(t)=\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{x(t)}\\right).$$\nBecause $\\gamma$ is continuous at $t_{0}$, we require $y(t)\\to y_{0}$ as $t\\to t_{0}^{+}$. We derive a contradiction: by continuity of $x$, the image $x((t_{0},t_{0}+\\delta))$ is an interval of the form $(0,a)$ for some $a>0$ and any sufficiently small $\\delta>0$. Fix two sequences\n$$r_{n}=\\frac{2}{4n+1},\\qquad s_{n}=\\frac{2}{4n+3},$$\nwhich satisfy $r_{n}\\to 0$, $s_{n}\\to 0$, and\n$$\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{r_{n}}\\right)=\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2\\pi n\\right)=1,\\qquad \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{s_{n}}\\right)=\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}+2\\pi n\\right)=-1.$$\nFor all large $n$, $r_{n},s_{n}\\in(0,a)$. By the intermediate value property of $x$ on $(t_{0},t_{0}+\\delta)$, there exist $t_{n},u_{n}\\in(t_{0},t_{0}+\\delta)$ with $x(t_{n})=r_{n}$ and $x(u_{n})=s_{n}$.

Thus $y(t)$ oscillates between values near $1$ and $-1$ arbitrarily close to $t_{0}$, so the right-hand limit $\\lim_{t\\to t_{0}^{+}}y(t)$ does not exist. This contradicts continuity of $\\gamma$ at $t_{0}$.
