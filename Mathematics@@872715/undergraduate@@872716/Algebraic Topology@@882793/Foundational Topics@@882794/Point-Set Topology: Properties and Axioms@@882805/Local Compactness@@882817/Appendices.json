If $X$ were compact, then $\\mathbb{R}$ would be compact as a continuous image of a compact space, which is false.

Fix $(x,q)\\in X$ and suppose, for contradiction, that there is a compact neighborhood $K\\subset X$ of $(x,q)$.

A closed subset of a compact space is compact, hence $[x,x+\\epsilon)$ would be compact, contradicting the noncompactness of basic intervals established above.
