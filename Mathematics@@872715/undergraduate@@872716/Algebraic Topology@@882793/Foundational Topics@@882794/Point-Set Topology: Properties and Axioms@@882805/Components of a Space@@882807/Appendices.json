By definition, they are in the same path component if there exists a continuous function $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to GL_2(\\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\\gamma(0) = A$ and $\\gamma(1) = B$.\n\nThe space $GL_2(\\mathbb{Q})$ is endowed with the subspace topology inherited from $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$. The space $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^4$. A function into a subspace is continuous if and only if it is continuous when viewed as a function into the larger ambient space. Therefore, the path $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to GL_2(\\mathbb{Q})$ being continuous means that the composition $i \\circ \\gamma: [0, 1] \\to M_2(\\mathbb{R})$, where $i$ is the inclusion map, is continuous.\n\nLet's represent the path $\\gamma(t)$ by its entries, which are functions of $t$:\n$$ \\gamma(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} a(t)  b(t) \\\\ c(t)  d(t) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe continuity of $\\gamma$ as a map into $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ means that each of the component functions $a(t)$, $b(t)$, $c(t)$, and $d(t)$ must be a continuous real-valued function on the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nThe crucial constraint is that the image of the path $\\gamma$ must lie entirely within $GL_2(\\mathbb{Q})$. This implies two conditions for all $t \\in [0, 1]$:\n1. The entries $a(t), b(t), c(t), d(t)$ must be rational numbers.\n2. The determinant $a(t)d(t) - b(t)c(t)$ must be non-zero.\n\nLet's focus on the first condition. Each component function, for example $a(t)$, is a continuous function from $[0, 1]$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ whose image is contained within the set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nA fundamental theorem in topology states that the image of a connected space under a continuous map is connected. The interval $[0, 1]$ is a connected topological space. Therefore, for each component function, its image must be a connected subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nNow we must consider the topological nature of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with the subspace topology inherited from $\\mathbb{R}$. The set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is totally disconnected. This means that the only connected subsets of $\\mathbb{Q}$ are the empty set and singleton sets (sets containing a single point). To see this, consider any subset $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}$ containing at least two distinct points, say $p$ and $q$ with $p  q$. There always exists an irrational number $r$ such that $p  r  q$. The sets $U = S \\cap (-\\infty, r)$ and $V = S \\cap (r, \\infty)$ are non-empty (since $p \\in U$ and $q \\in V$), disjoint, open in the subspace topology of $S$, and their union is $S$. This shows that any subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with more than one point is disconnected.\n\nSince the image of each component function (e.g., $a([0,1])$) must be a connected subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$, it must be a singleton set. This implies that each component function must be a constant function.\nSo, $a(t) = a_0$, $b(t) = b_0$, $c(t) = c_0$, and $d(t) = d_0$ for some constants $a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis means that the path $\\gamma(t)$ is a constant matrix:\n$$ \\gamma(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} a_0  b_0 \\\\ c_0  d_0 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{for all } t \\in [0, 1] $$\nIf this path connects $A$ to $B$, we must have $\\gamma(0) = A$ and $\\gamma(1) = B$. Since $\\gamma(t)$ is constant, we have $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(1)$. Therefore, we must have $A = B$.\n\nThis shows that a path in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Q})$ can only connect a matrix to itself. Two distinct matrices can never lie in the same path component. Consequently, each path component of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Q})$ consists of a single matrix. So, two matrices $A$ and $B$ are in the same path component if and only if they are the same matrix, i.e., $A=B$.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n- Option B is the condition for path-connectedness in $GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$, where path entries can vary continuously through real numbers.\n- Option C claims the space is path-connected, which we have shown to be false.\n- Options D and E are algebraic conditions. While they may define interesting equivalence relations on $GL_2(\\mathbb{Q})$, they are not equivalent to the topological condition of path-connectedness, which is much more restrictive due to the nature of continuous functions into $\\mathbb{Q}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1641908"}]}
