We must provide the expression for $\\phi_1(x)$.\n\nThe two defining conditions are:\n1.  $\\text{supp}(\\phi_1) \\subseteq U_1$ and $\\text{supp}(\\phi_2) \\subseteq U_2$.\n2.  $\\phi_1(x) + \\phi_2(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$.\n\nThe support, $\\text{supp}(\\phi_i)$, is a closed set. For $\\text{supp}(\\phi_1)$ to be a subset of the open set $U_1 = [0, 3/4)$, $\\phi_1$ must be zero not only for $x \\ge 3/4$ but also in a small neighborhood around $x=3/4$. Similarly, for $\\text{supp}(\\phi_2) \\subseteq U_2 = (1/4, 1]$, $\\phi_2$ must be zero not only for $x \\le 1/4$ but also in a small neighborhood around $x=1/4$.\n\nLet's use the second condition: $\\phi_1(x) = 1 - \\phi_2(x)$.\nWhere $\\phi_2(x) = 0$, we must have $\\phi_1(x) = 1$.\nWhere $\\phi_1(x) = 0$, we must have $\\phi_2(x) = 1$.\n\nTo satisfy the support conditions, we need to find a \"transition region\" $(a, b)$ that is contained within the intersection of the two open sets, $U_1 \\cap U_2 = (1/4, 3/4)$. Let's choose a simple interval, for example, by picking $a=1/3$ and $b=2/3$. Note that $1/4  1/3  2/3  3/4$, so $[1/3, 2/3] \\subseteq (1/4, 3/4)$.\n\nWe can define our functions as follows:\n- On the interval $[0, 1/3]$, we can set $\\phi_2(x)=0$. To satisfy the sum condition, this means $\\phi_1(x)=1$.\n- On the interval $[2/3, 1]$, we can set $\\phi_1(x)=0$. This implies $\\phi_2(x)=1$.\n- On the interval $(1/3, 2/3)$, both functions can be non-zero. We need to define them to ensure continuity at $x=1/3$ and $x=2/3$. The simplest way to achieve this is with linear functions.\n\nLet's construct $\\phi_1(x)$. We require:\n- $\\phi_1(x) = 1$ for $x \\in [0, 1/3]$.\n- $\\phi_1(x) = 0$ for $x \\in [2/3, 1]$.\n- For $x \\in (1/3, 2/3)$, we define $\\phi_1(x)$ as the linear function that connects the point $(1/3, 1)$ to $(2/3, 0)$.\nThe slope of this line is $m = \\frac{0-1}{2/3 - 1/3} = \\frac{-1}{1/3} = -3$.\nUsing the point-slope form with the point $(2/3, 0)$, the equation is $y - 0 = -3(x - 2/3)$, which simplifies to $y = -3x + 2$.\n\nSo, the complete piecewise definition for $\\phi_1(x)$ is:\n$$\n\\phi_1(x) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le 1/3 \\\\ -3x + 2  \\text{if } 1/3  x  2/3 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } 2/3 \\le x \\le 1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis function is continuous. On $[1/3, 2/3]$, it decreases linearly from $1$ to $0$, so its range is within $[0,1]$.\n\nWe can find $\\phi_2(x)$ using $\\phi_2(x) = 1-\\phi_1(x)$:\n$$\n\\phi_2(x) = \\begin{cases} 0  \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le 1/3 \\\\ 1 - (-3x + 2) = 3x - 1  \\text{if } 1/3  x  2/3 \\\\ 1  \\text{if } 2/3 \\le x \\le 1 \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nLet's perform a final check of the support conditions:\n- For $\\phi_1(x)$: The set where $\\phi_1(x) \\neq 0$ is $[0, 2/3)$. The closure of this set (the support) is $[0, 2/3]$. We need to check if $[0, 2/3] \\subseteq U_1 = [0, 3/4)$. Since $2/3 = 0.666...$ and $3/4 = 0.75$, the condition $2/3  3/4$ is met. So $\\text{supp}(\\phi_1) \\subseteq U_1$.\n- For $\\phi_2(x)$: The set where $\\phi_2(x) \\neq 0$ is $(1/3, 1]$. The closure of this set is $[1/3, 1]$. We need to check if $[1/3, 1] \\subseteq U_2 = (1/4, 1]$. Since $1/3 = 0.333...$ and $1/4 = 0.25$, the condition $1/3 > 1/4$ is met. So $\\text{supp}(\\phi_2) \\subseteq U_2$.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied.
