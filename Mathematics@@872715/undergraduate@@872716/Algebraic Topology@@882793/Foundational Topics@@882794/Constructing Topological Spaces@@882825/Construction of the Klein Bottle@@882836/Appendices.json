By identifying, or \"gluing,\" the edges of this square according to specific rules, we can create surfaces with surprising properties, such as the Klein bottle. This first practice focuses on translating these geometric gluing instructions into a symbolic \"boundary word,\" a fundamental step in analyzing the algebraic structure of the resulting space [@problem_id:1543043].", "problem": "The Klein bottle is a fascinating non-orientable surface that can be constructed from a square by identifying pairs of its edges in a specific way. This process is formally described by defining a fundamental polygon and its edge identifications. The fundamental group of the resulting surface, which captures information about its essential loops, can be determined by reading the word formed by traversing the boundary of this polygon.\n\nConsider the construction of a Klein bottle from a square fundamental polygon. The identifications are as follows:\n1.  The left vertical edge is identified with the right vertical edge, with their directions aligned (e.g., both pointing upwards). The topological loop formed by this identification is represented by the generator $a$.\n2.  The bottom horizontal edge is identified with the top horizontal edge, but with their directions opposite to one another, creating a twist (e.g., the bottom edge is oriented rightwards, while the top edge is oriented leftwards). The topological loop formed by this identification is represented by the generator $b$.\n\nBy starting at the bottom-left corner of the square and moving along its boundary in a counter-clockwise direction, one obtains a sequence of generators and their inverses. This sequence, read as a word, represents the relation in the fundamental group $\\pi_1(K)$ of the Klein bottle, $K$.\n\nYour task is to determine this boundary word. Express your answer as a single, unsimplified word using only the symbols $a$, $b$, and their inverses, $a^{-1}$ and $b^{-1}$.", "solution": "To find the boundary word, we trace the edges of the square counter-clockwise and label the corresponding paths according to the generators. The problem states that the vertical identification loop is generator $a$ and the horizontal is $b$. Let's define the paths on the boundary consistently: let the path going up the right edge be represented by $a$, and the path going right along the bottom edge be represented by $b$.\n\nStep-by-step traversal from the bottom-left corner:\n1. Bottom edge: We traverse from left to right. This corresponds to the path $b$. Record $b$.\n2. Right edge: We traverse upward. This corresponds to the path $a$. Record $a$.\n3. Top edge: We traverse from right to left. The identification `(x,0) ~ (1-x,1)` means that traversing the top edge from right to left is equivalent to traversing the bottom edge from left to right. This corresponds to path $b$. Record $b$.\n4. Left edge: We traverse downward. This is the reverse of an upward traversal. The identification `(0,y) ~ (1,y)` means an upward traversal on the left edge is equivalent to an upward traversal on the right edge (path $a$). Therefore, the downward path is the inverse, $a^{-1}$. Record $a^{-1}$.\n\nConcatenating in order, the boundary word is $baba^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{baba^{-1}}$$", "id": "1543043"}, {"introduction": "Once a space is defined by identifications on a fundamental polygon, we can explore its unique geometry.

The square is a single $2$-cell, so $F = 1$.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of distinct vertices ($V$) after identification. The boundary word $aabb$ means:\n- The first edge, $e_1$ (from $v_1$ to $v_2$), is identified with the second edge, $e_2$ (from $v_2$ to $v_3$). Since orientations are preserved, their initial points are identified ($v_1 \\sim v_2$) and their terminal points are identified ($v_2 \\sim v_3$). This implies $v_1 \\sim v_2 \\sim v_3$.\n- The third edge, $e_3$ (from $v_3$ to $v_4$), is identified with the fourth edge, $e_4$ (from $v_4$ to $v_1$). Preserved orientation implies $v_3 \\sim v_4$ and $v_4 \\sim v_1$. This implies $v_1 \\sim v_3 \\sim v_4$.\nCombining both sets of equivalences, we get $v_1 \\sim v_2 \\sim v_3 \\sim v_4$. All four vertices of the square map to a single point on the surface. Therefore, the number of vertices in the quotient space is $V = 1$.\n\nNext, we determine the number of distinct edges ($E$).\n- The two edges labeled $a$ ($e_1$ and $e_2$) are identified, forming one edge in the quotient space.\n- The two edges labeled $b$ ($e_3$ and $e_4$) are identified, forming a second edge.\nThus, the number of edges in the quotient space is $E = 2$.\n\nNow, we compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi$:\n$$ \\chi = V - E + F = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0. $$\n\nFinally, we determine the orientability of the surface. A surface constructed from a fundamental polygon is non-orientable if its boundary word contains a pair of identical letters with the same orientation (e.g., $...a...a...$). The word $aabb$ contains such pairs for both $a$ and $b$. Therefore, the surface is non-orientable.\n\nWe use the classification theorem to identify the surface:\n- We are looking for a non-orientable surface with $\\chi = 0$.\n- For an orientable surface, $\\chi=0$ corresponds to the Torus ($g=1, \\chi = 2-2(1)=0$). But our surface is non-orientable.\n- For a non-orientable surface (a connected sum of $k$ projective planes), the Euler characteristic is $\\chi = 2 - k$.\n- Setting our calculated $\\chi=0$, we get $0 = 2 - k$, which implies $k=2$.\nThe surface is the connected sum of two real projective planes, $\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\# \\mathbb{RP}^2$.
