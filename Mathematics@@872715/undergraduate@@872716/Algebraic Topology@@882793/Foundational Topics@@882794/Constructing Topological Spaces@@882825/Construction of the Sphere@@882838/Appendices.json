We can define the 2-sphere as the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, i.e., $S^2 = \\{ (a,b,c) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid a^2+b^2+c^2 = 1 \\}$. To prove that $X$ is homeomorphic to $S^2$, we will construct a continuous, surjective map $F: D^2 \\to S^2$ that respects the equivalence relation $\\sim$. This means that $F(p_1) = F(p_2)$ if and only if $p_1 \\sim p_2$. Such a map induces a continuous bijection $\\bar{F}: X \\to S^2$. Since $D^2$ is compact and the quotient map $\\pi: D^2 \\to X$ is continuous, $X$ is compact. As $S^2$ is a Hausdorff space, the continuous bijection $\\bar{F}$ from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.\n\nLet's first develop a geometric intuition for the quotient space $X$. We can think of the disk $D^2$ as a collection of vertical line segments. For each $x \\in [-1, 1]$, let $L_x$ be the line segment defined by $L_x = \\{ (x, y) \\mid -\\sqrt{1-x^2} \\le y \\le \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\}$. The disk $D^2$ is the union of all such segments $L_x$.\n\nThe equivalence relation $\\sim$ does not affect the interior points of the disk. The identification happens on the boundary $S^1$. For a given $x \\in (-1, 1)$, the endpoints of the segment $L_x$ are $(x, \\sqrt{1-x^2})$ and $(x, -\\sqrt{1-x^2})$. These are points on the boundary of the disk. The relation $(x,y) \\sim (x,-y)$ for boundary points implies that these two endpoints of $L_x$ are identified in the quotient space $X$.\n\nFor each $x \\in (-1, 1)$, the line segment $L_x$ becomes a circle in the quotient space $X$, because its two endpoints are glued together. Let's call this circle $C_x$. The circumference of $C_x$ is equal to the length of the segment $L_x$, which is $2\\sqrt{1-x^2}$.\n\nWhat happens at the extremities $x = 1$ and $x = -1$?\nFor $x=1$, the segment $L_1$ is just the point $(1,0)$. The identification is trivial, $(1,0) \\sim (1,-0) = (1,0)$. So, $L_1$ becomes a single point in $X$. This corresponds to a circle $C_1$ of zero radius.\nFor $x=-1$, the segment $L_{-1}$ is the point $(-1,0)$. Similarly, this becomes a single point in $X$, a circle $C_{-1}$ of zero radius.\n\nThe space $X$ can therefore be visualized as a collection of circles $C_x$ parameterized by $x \\in [-1,1]$. The circles are stacked along the x-axis, with the largest circle at $x=0$ (corresponding to the vertical diameter of the disk) and the circles shrinking to points at $x=\\pm 1$. This geometric shape is a sphere.\n\nNow, we make this argument rigorous by constructing the map $F: D^2 \\to S^2$. Let $(x,y)$ be a point in $D^2$. We want to map this to a point $(a,b,c)$ on $S^2$. Inspired by our geometric intuition, we can map the `x`-coordinate of the disk to the `c`-coordinate (height) of the sphere. Let $c = x$.\nFor a fixed $x$, the segment $L_x$ in the disk is mapped to a circle of constant height $c=x$ on the sphere. This is a circle of latitude. The points on this circle are parameterized by the $y$ coordinate. The mapping from the interval $[-\\sqrt{1-x^2}, \\sqrt{1-x^2}]$ for $y$ to a circle must be such that the endpoints $y=\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ and $y=-\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ map to the same point.\nLet's define an angle $\\psi$ that depends on $y$. A natural choice is to scale $y$ to fit the range of an angle, say $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. Let $\\psi = \\pi \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$ for $x \\in (-1,1)$. When $y=\\sqrt{1-x^2}$, $\\psi=\\pi$. When $y=-\\sqrt{1-x^2}$, $\\psi=-\\pi$. Since $\\cos(\\pi)=\\cos(-\\pi)$ and $\\sin(\\pi)=\\sin(-\\pi)=0$, this will ensure the endpoints map to the same location.\n\nThe coordinates on the sphere for a given height $c=x$ are $a = \\sqrt{1-c^2}\\cos\\psi$ and $b = \\sqrt{1-c^2}\\sin\\psi$. Substituting $c=x$ and our expression for $\\psi$, we define our map $F: D^2 \\to S^2$ for $x \\in (-1,1)$ as:\n$$ F(x,y) = \\left( \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\right), \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\right), x \\right) $$\nWe must also define the map for $x=\\pm 1$.\nAs $(x,y) \\to (1,0)$, we have $\\sqrt{1-x^2} \\to 0$. The arguments to sin and cos are bounded, so the first two components of $F(x,y)$ approach 0. The third component approaches 1. So, we define $F(1,0) = (0,0,1)$.\nSimilarly, as $(x,y) \\to (-1,0)$, we define $F(-1,0) = (0,0,-1)$.\nThe map $F$ is continuous on all of $D^2$.\n\nNext, we verify that $F$ respects the equivalence relation $\\sim$. The relation is non-trivial only on the boundary, where $y^2 = 1 - x^2$, so $y = \\pm \\sqrt{1-x^2}$. Let $p_1 = (x, \\sqrt{1-x^2})$ and $p_2 = (x, -\\sqrt{1-x^2})$.\n$$ F(p_1) = F(x, \\sqrt{1-x^2}) = (\\sqrt{1-x^2}\\cos(\\pi), \\sqrt{1-x^2}\\sin(\\pi), x) = (-\\sqrt{1-x^2}, 0, x) $$\n$$ F(p_2) = F(x, -\\sqrt{1-x^2}) = (\\sqrt{1-x^2}\\cos(-\\pi), \\sqrt{1-x^2}\\sin(-\\pi), x) = (-\\sqrt{1-x^2}, 0, x) $$\nThus, $F(p_1) = F(p_2)$, which shows that $F$ is constant on the equivalence classes of the boundary points. For interior points, the equivalence classes are singletons, so the condition is trivially satisfied.\n\nThe map $F$ is also surjective. Given any point $(a,b,c) \\in S^2$, we can find a preimage $(x,y) \\in D^2$. We set $x=c$. If $c=\\pm 1$, the preimage is $(\\pm 1, 0)$. If $c \\in (-1,1)$, then $\\sqrt{1-c^2} > 0$. We can find a unique angle $\\psi \\in (-\\pi, \\pi]$ such that $\\cos\\psi = a/\\sqrt{1-c^2}$ and $\\sin\\psi = b/\\sqrt{1-c^2}$. Then we solve for $y$ using $\\psi = \\pi y / \\sqrt{1-c^2}$, which gives $y = (\\psi/\\pi)\\sqrt{1-c^2}$. Since $|\\psi| \\le \\pi$, we have $|y| \\le \\sqrt{1-c^2} = \\sqrt{1-x^2}$, so the point $(x,y)$ is in $D^2$.\n\nThe map $F$ is injective on the interior of the disk. If $F(x_1, y_1) = F(x_2, y_2)$, then $x_1 = x_2$. This implies that the arguments to the trigonometric functions must match (up to $2\\pi k$), which leads to $y_1=y_2$. Thus $F$ is one-to-one on the interior.\nWe have shown that $F(p_1) = F(p_2)$ if and only if $p_1 \\sim p_2$.\n\nBy the universal property of quotient spaces, $F$ induces a continuous bijection $\\bar{F}: X = D^2/\\sim \\to S^2$. Since $X$ is the continuous image of the compact space $D^2$, it is compact. $S^2$ is a Hausdorff space. A continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.\nTherefore, $X$ is homeomorphic to $S^2$.\n\nThe other options are incorrect. For instance, $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary of the disk, i.e., $(x,y) \\sim (-x,-y)$, which is a different identification. The torus $T^2$ and Klein bottle are usually constructed from a square and have different topological properties (e.g., their fundamental groups are different from the trivial group of $S^2$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1643575"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple gluing, we now explore a more structured method for building spaces known as a CW complex construction.

The 1-skeleton, $X^1$, is formed by attaching $n$ distinct 1-cells, $e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_n$ (for an integer $n \\ge 3$), to $X^0$.

This creates $n$ meridians, or paths, connecting the South Pole to the North Pole. We denote the path along $e_i$ from $v_S$ to $v_N$ by the same symbol $e_i$.\n3.  The 1-skeleton $X^1$ is a graph. We choose the basepoint for the fundamental group to be $v_S$. A spanning tree for this graph is given by the single edge $e_1$.

Finally, the 2-skeleton, $X^2$, is formed by attaching $n$ 2-cells, $f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_n$, to $X^1$.
