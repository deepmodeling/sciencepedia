Choose a homeomorphism from a rectangle $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ onto $L$ that sends the left and right edges to the two bounding great semicircles of $L$ (from $N$ to $S$), and sends the bottom and top edges to interior arcs joining $N$ to $S$ (so that only the two vertices map to $N$ and $S$). Under the antipodal map $A$, the second copy $-L$ is parameterized by another rectangle whose left and right edges correspond to the complementary semicircles on the same great circles, and whose top and bottom edges correspond to arcs mapped antipodally to those of $L$. On $R$, the involution $A$ interchanges the two rectangles and identifies the left edge of $L$ with the right edge of $-L$ and the right edge of $L$ with the left edge of $-L$ with a reversal of the edge parameter (the antipodal map reverses the orientation along each great circle). The top and bottom edges of $L$ are interchanged with the corresponding edges of $-L$ and so are identified into interior by the quotient.\n\nConsequently, the quotient $R/\\langle A\\rangle$ is obtained from a single rectangle by identifying its two vertical edges via an orientation-reversing identification:\n$$\n(0,t)\\sim(1,1-t),\\quad t\\in[0,1].\n$$\nThis is precisely the standard construction of a Möbius strip.
