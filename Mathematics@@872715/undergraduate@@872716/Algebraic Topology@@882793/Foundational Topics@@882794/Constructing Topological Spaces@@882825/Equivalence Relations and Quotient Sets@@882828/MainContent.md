## Introduction
In the study of topology, our goal is to understand the intrinsic nature of shapes, independent of their specific embedding in space. While we often begin with familiar objects like spheres and planes, the real power of topology lies in its ability to construct a vast and exotic universe of new spaces from these simple building blocks. But how do we formalize the intuitive idea of “gluing” parts of a shape together, like taping the ends of a paper strip to form a cylinder or a Möbius strip? This process of identification is central to modern geometry and topology, yet it requires a rigorous mathematical foundation to be truly useful.

This article provides a comprehensive introduction to this fundamental construction. We will bridge the gap between intuitive geometric manipulation and the precise language of abstract topology.
First, in **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will lay the groundwork by defining [equivalence relations](@entry_id:138275) and their resulting [quotient sets](@entry_id:271976). We will then introduce the crucial concept of the [quotient topology](@entry_id:150384), the framework that gives these new sets a coherent topological structure, and explore the universal property that makes it a powerful analytical tool.
Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will put this theory into practice, demonstrating how to construct a menagerie of famous spaces—including the torus, the [real projective plane](@entry_id:150364), and the Möbius strip. We will also see how [quotient spaces](@entry_id:274314), in the form of orbit spaces, provide a powerful language for describing symmetry in fields from linear algebra to physics.
Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will offer a series of problems designed to solidify your understanding and provide practical experience in identifying and analyzing [quotient spaces](@entry_id:274314).

## Principles and Mechanisms

In topology, one of our primary goals is to understand and classify the shapes of different spaces. While we often begin with familiar objects like spheres, lines, and planes, a vast universe of more complex and interesting spaces can be constructed from these basic building blocks. The fundamental mechanism for this construction is the notion of a **[quotient space](@entry_id:148218)**, which involves "gluing" or "identifying" certain points of an existing space together. This chapter lays out the rigorous principles behind this process, moving from the algebraic concept of an equivalence relation to the topological construction of new spaces.

### Equivalence Relations and Quotient Sets

At the core of any identification process is an **equivalence relation**. An equivalence relation $\sim$ on a set $X$ is a [binary relation](@entry_id:260596) that is:
1.  **Reflexive**: For all $x \in X$, $x \sim x$.
2.  **Symmetric**: If $x \sim y$, then $y \sim x$.
3.  **Transitive**: If $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z$, then $x \sim z$.

An equivalence relation partitions the set $X$ into a collection of disjoint subsets called **equivalence classes**. The [equivalence class](@entry_id:140585) of an element $x \in X$, denoted by $[x]$, is the set of all elements in $X$ that are equivalent to $x$:
$$
[x] = \{ y \in X \mid y \sim x \}
$$
The set of all such equivalence classes is called the **[quotient set](@entry_id:137935)**, denoted by $X/\sim$. Each element of the [quotient set](@entry_id:137935) is an entire [equivalence class](@entry_id:140585) from the original set $X$. In essence, we have collapsed each [equivalence class](@entry_id:140585) into a single new point.

This process can dramatically change the nature of the set. Consider the set of all $2 \times 2$ real matrices, $M_2(\mathbb{R})$, which is topologically equivalent to $\mathbb{R}^4$. If we define two matrices to be equivalent when they have the same determinant, $A \sim B \iff \det(A) = \det(B)$, we partition this four-dimensional space. The resulting [quotient set](@entry_id:137935), $M_2(\mathbb{R})/\sim$, consists of equivalence classes, where each class is uniquely identified by a single real number—the determinant. This [quotient set](@entry_id:137935) is in a natural one-to-one correspondence with the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ itself [@problem_id:1647958].

This idea of parameterizing equivalence classes is a powerful tool. Let's take a more abstract example from [functional analysis](@entry_id:146220). Consider the space $X = C([0,1])$ of all continuous functions on the interval $[0,1]$. We can define an equivalence relation where two functions $f$ and $g$ are equivalent if they share the same value for their [definite integral](@entry_id:142493) and the same value for the sum of their endpoints: $f \sim g \iff \int_0^1 f(x) dx = \int_0^1 g(x) dx$ and $f(0)+f(1) = g(0)+g(1)$. Each [equivalence class](@entry_id:140585) is uniquely determined by a pair of real numbers: the value of the integral and the value of the endpoint sum. Thus, the [quotient set](@entry_id:137935) $X/\sim$ is in [bijection](@entry_id:138092) with the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ [@problem_id:1647931].

The cardinality, or "size," of the [quotient set](@entry_id:137935) can also be surprising. Let's define an [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135) on the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ by stating that $x \sim y$ if their difference $x-y$ is a rational number. Each [equivalence class](@entry_id:140585) is of the form $[x] = x + \mathbb{Q} = \{x+q \mid q \in \mathbb{Q}\}$. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite, every [equivalence class](@entry_id:140585) is countably infinite. The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ are partitioned into these classes. If $S = \mathbb{R}/\sim$ is the [quotient set](@entry_id:137935), the [cardinality](@entry_id:137773) of $\mathbb{R}$ can be expressed as the product of the number of classes and the size of each class: $|\mathbb{R}| = |S| \cdot |\mathbb{Q}| = |S| \cdot \aleph_0$. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, $S$ must also be uncountable. In fact, using [cardinal arithmetic](@entry_id:151251), it can be shown that $|S| = |\mathbb{R}|$. We have partitioned an [uncountable set](@entry_id:153749) into a collection of countably [infinite sets](@entry_id:137163), and the number of such sets is still [uncountably infinite](@entry_id:147147), with the same [cardinality](@entry_id:137773) as the original set [@problem_id:1647953].

### The Quotient Topology

Once we have the [quotient set](@entry_id:137935) $X/\sim$, our next task is to give it a topological structure that is naturally inherited from the original space $X$. This is achieved through the **[quotient topology](@entry_id:150384)**.

Let $X$ be a [topological space](@entry_id:149165) and $\sim$ an [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135) on $X$. Let $q: X \to X/\sim$ be the **[quotient map](@entry_id:140877)** (or **projection map**) that sends each point $x \in X$ to its [equivalence class](@entry_id:140585) $[x]$. The [quotient topology](@entry_id:150384) on $X/\sim$ is defined as follows:

A subset $U \subseteq X/\sim$ is **open** if and only if its [preimage](@entry_id:150899) under the [quotient map](@entry_id:140877), $q^{-1}(U)$, is an open set in $X$.

This definition is specifically crafted to be the finest (i.e., having the most open sets) topology on $X/\sim$ that makes the [quotient map](@entry_id:140877) $q: X \to X/\sim$ a continuous function. This is a crucial property, as it ensures that the "gluing" process is not so violent as to completely sever the topological connection between the original space and the new one.

Let's explore how to determine the open sets in a [quotient space](@entry_id:148218) with a concrete example. Consider the real line $\mathbb{R}$ with the [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135) $x \sim y$ if and only if $\lfloor x \rfloor = \lfloor y \rfloor$, where $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ is the [floor function](@entry_id:265373). The [equivalence classes](@entry_id:156032) are the half-[open intervals](@entry_id:157577) $[n, n+1)$ for each integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. The [quotient set](@entry_id:137935) $X = \mathbb{R}/\sim$ is therefore in [bijection](@entry_id:138092) with the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$. What is the [quotient topology](@entry_id:150384) on this set? [@problem_id:1647957]

Let's call our [quotient space](@entry_id:148218) $Z_{q}$. A subset $S \subseteq Z_{q}$ is open if and only if its [preimage](@entry_id:150899) $q^{-1}(S) = \bigcup_{n \in S} [n, n+1)$ is open in $\mathbb{R}$. Suppose $S$ is a non-empty open set in $Z_{q}$ and let $m \in S$. Then the interval $[m, m+1)$ is part of the open set $q^{-1}(S)$. Since $q^{-1}(S)$ is open in $\mathbb{R}$, for the point $m \in q^{-1}(S)$, there must exist some small $\varepsilon > 0$ such that the open interval $(m-\varepsilon, m+\varepsilon)$ is contained in $q^{-1}(S)$. In particular, the interval $(m-\varepsilon, m)$ must be in $q^{-1}(S)$. For any point $z \in (m-\varepsilon, m)$, we have $\lfloor z \rfloor = m-1$. This means the [equivalence class](@entry_id:140585) corresponding to the integer $m-1$ must be in $S$. Therefore, if $m \in S$, then $m-1$ must also be in $S$. By induction, this means that for any $k \le m$, $k \in S$. The non-empty open sets of $Z_{q}$ are therefore $\mathbb{Z}$ and all "downwardly-closed" sets of the form $\{n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid n \le k\}$ for some integer $k$. This topology is quite different from the standard discrete topology on $\mathbb{Z}$, where every individual point is an open set.

### A Universal Property for Identification

While the definition of the [quotient topology](@entry_id:150384) is precise, it can be cumbersome to work with directly. A more powerful tool for identifying a [quotient space](@entry_id:148218) with a known space is the **universal property of the [quotient topology](@entry_id:150384)**.

Suppose $q: X \to X/\sim$ is a [quotient map](@entry_id:140877). Let $f: X \to Y$ be a continuous function to some [topological space](@entry_id:149165) $Y$. If $f$ is constant on the equivalence classes of $\sim$ (i.e., if $x_1 \sim x_2$, then $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$), then there exists a **unique continuous map** $\tilde{f}: X/\sim \to Y$ such that $f = \tilde{f} \circ q$.

This property states that any [continuous map](@entry_id:153772) from $X$ that respects the identifications of the quotient "factors through" the quotient space. If this [induced map](@entry_id:271712) $\tilde{f}$ can be shown to be a bijection, and we can find a continuous inverse, then we have established a [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933) between our newly constructed quotient space $X/\sim$ and the familiar space $Y$.

Let's see this property in action. Consider the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the equivalence relation $(x_1, y_1) \sim (x_2, y_2)$ if $|x_1| = |x_2|$ and $y_1=y_2$. This relation effectively identifies each point $(x,y)$ with its reflection across the y-axis, $(-x,y)$. What is the resulting space? [@problem_id:1647925]. Intuitively, we are "folding" the plane along the y-axis. The result should be the closed right half-plane $H_1 = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x \ge 0\}$.

To prove this formally, we define a continuous map $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to H_1$ by $f(x,y) = (|x|, y)$. This map is clearly continuous and surjective. Observe that $f(p_1) = f(p_2)$ if and only if $p_1 \sim p_2$. This means $f$ is constant on the equivalence classes. By the universal property, there exists a unique continuous map $\tilde{f}: \mathbb{R}^2/\sim \to H_1$. This map is a [bijection](@entry_id:138092). To show it is a [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933), we must show its inverse is continuous. The inclusion map $i: H_1 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is continuous. Composing with the [quotient map](@entry_id:140877) $q: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2/\sim$ gives a [continuous map](@entry_id:153772) $q \circ i : H_1 \to \mathbb{R}^2/\sim$, which is precisely the inverse of $\tilde{f}$. Thus, $\mathbb{R}^2/\sim$ is homeomorphic to the closed right half-plane.

As another example, let's identify points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that are equidistant from the origin: $p_1 \sim p_2 \iff \|p_1\| = \|p_2\|$ [@problem_id:1647934]. The [equivalence classes](@entry_id:156032) are circles of radius $r \ge 0$ centered at the origin (with the origin itself being a class of radius $0$). Let's define a function $\rho: \mathbb{R}^2 \to [0, \infty)$ by $\rho(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. This map is continuous and its fibers (preimages of points) are precisely the equivalence classes. The universal property grants us a [continuous bijection](@entry_id:198258) $\tilde{\rho}: \mathbb{R}^2/\sim \to [0, \infty)$. The map $s: [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}^2$ given by $s(r)=(r,0)$ provides a continuous "section" that allows us to construct a continuous inverse to $\tilde{\rho}$, confirming that the quotient space is homeomorphic to the non-negative real half-line $[0, \infty)$.

### Canonical Examples of Quotient Spaces

The true power of [quotient spaces](@entry_id:274314) lies in their ability to construct a rich bestiary of topological objects.

#### Gluing, Collapsing, and Identifying

Many familiar spaces can be viewed as the result of a gluing process.
- **The Figure-Eight:** Imagine a simple loop, like a circle $S^1$. What happens if we identify two distinct points on this circle? For example, consider a square-shaped graph with vertices $A, B, C, D$ in order. This is topologically a circle. If we identify the opposite vertices $A$ and $C$, the path from $A$ to $B$ to $C$ becomes a loop starting and ending at the new identified point, and the path from $C$ to $D$ to $A$ becomes another loop. The result is two circles joined at a single point, a space known as the **figure-eight** or the **[wedge sum](@entry_id:270607) of two circles**, denoted $S^1 \vee S^1$ [@problem_id:1647941].
- **The Wedge Sum:** The previous construction can be generalized. If we start with two disjoint spaces, say two circles $C_1$ and $C_2$, and pick a single point $p_1 \in C_1$ and $p_2 \in C_2$, identifying only these two points gives the [wedge sum](@entry_id:270607) $C_1 \vee C_2$. This is the prototypical example of gluing two spaces together at a single point [@problem_id:1647932].
- **Collapsing a Subspace:** A common operation is to take a subspace $A \subseteq X$ and collapse it entirely to a single point. This defines an [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135) where all points in $A$ are equivalent to each other, and all points outside $A$ are only equivalent to themselves. The resulting space is denoted $X/A$. For instance, a 2-sphere $S^2$ can be formed from a [closed disk](@entry_id:148403) $\overline{D^2}$ by collapsing its entire boundary circle $S^1$ to a single point.

A more complex example demonstrates the power of this technique. What space results from collapsing the entire x-axis of the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ to a point? [@problem_id:1647963]. We can analyze this by decomposing $\mathbb{R}^2$ into the closed upper half-plane $U = \{(x,y) \mid y \ge 0\}$ and the closed lower half-plane $L = \{(x,y) \mid y \le 0\}$. The intersection $U \cap L$ is the x-axis. When we perform the quotient, the space $U$ has its boundary (the x-axis) collapsed to a point. This is topologically equivalent to taking a [closed disk](@entry_id:148403) and collapsing its boundary, which yields a sphere $S^2$. Similarly, the lower half-plane $L$ with its boundary collapsed also yields an $S^2$. Since both of these spheres were formed by collapsing the same x-axis, they are joined at the single point that represents the collapsed axis. The resulting space is therefore the [wedge sum](@entry_id:270607) of two spheres, $S^2 \vee S^2$.

#### Orbit Spaces

A particularly elegant form of [quotient space](@entry_id:148218) arises from the action of a group on a [topological space](@entry_id:149165). If a group $G$ acts on a space $X$, it partitions $X$ into **orbits**. The orbit of a point $x \in X$ is the set $G \cdot x = \{g \cdot x \mid g \in G\}$. The relation $x \sim y$ if $y$ is in the orbit of $x$ is an equivalence relation. The resulting quotient space $X/\sim$ is called the **[orbit space](@entry_id:148658)** and is denoted $X/G$.

Consider the space of non-zero complex numbers, $X = \mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$, which is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}_{>0} \times S^1$. Let the group of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ act on this space by multiplication: for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $z \in X$, the action is $z \mapsto 2^n z$. We wish to identify the [orbit space](@entry_id:148658) $X/\mathbb{Z}$ [@problem_id:1647952].

Using [polar coordinates](@entry_id:159425), $z = re^{i\theta}$, the action becomes $(r, e^{i\theta}) \mapsto (2^n r, e^{i\theta})$. We see the action only affects the [radial coordinate](@entry_id:165186) $r$. Therefore, the [quotient space](@entry_id:148218) will be a product of the quotient on the radial part and the quotient on the angular part: $( \mathbb{R}_{>0} / \sim_r ) \times ( S^1 / \sim_\theta )$. The action on the angle is trivial, so $S^1/\sim_\theta = S^1$. For the radial part, two radii $r_1, r_2$ are equivalent if $r_2 = 2^n r_1$ for some integer $n$. By applying the logarithm, which is a [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933) from $(\mathbb{R}_{>0}, \times)$ to $(\mathbb{R}, +)$, this equivalence becomes $\ln(r_2) = \ln(r_1) + n\ln(2)$. This is simply the real line $\mathbb{R}$ where we identify points that differ by an integer multiple of $\ln(2)$. This process of identifying points in $\mathbb{R}$ with a regular period "wraps" the line into a circle, $S^1$. Therefore, $\mathbb{R}_{>0}/\sim_r$ is homeomorphic to $S^1$.

Combining these results, the [orbit space](@entry_id:148658) $X/\mathbb{Z}$ is homeomorphic to $S^1 \times S^1$, the torus. This example beautifully illustrates how a [group action](@entry_id:143336) on a [non-compact space](@entry_id:155039) can produce a compact one, and how changing our perspective (via [polar coordinates](@entry_id:159425) and the logarithm) can reveal the underlying structure of the quotient.
