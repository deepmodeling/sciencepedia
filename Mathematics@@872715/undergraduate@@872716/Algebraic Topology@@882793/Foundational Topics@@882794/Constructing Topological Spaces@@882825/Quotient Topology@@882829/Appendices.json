By the definition of quotient spaces, $X/\\sim$ is obtained by gluing the bottom edge to the top edge with a reversal of orientation, while the left and right edges are not glued to anything else.\n\nKey topological principle: Gluing one pair of opposite edges of a rectangle with orientation preserved produces a cylinder, while gluing with orientation reversed produces a Möbius strip. If both pairs of opposite edges are glued, one obtains closed surfaces: torus if both gluings preserve orientation, Klein bottle if one preserves and the other reverses orientation. The $2$-sphere cannot be obtained by this single-edge gluing and, moreover, is closed (has empty boundary), unlike a strip.\n\nIdentify the specific gluing in this problem: the relation $(x,0) \\sim (1-x,1)$ reverses the horizontal coordinate, hence reverses the orientation along that pair of edges. Therefore, the top and bottom edges are glued with a half-twist. The left and right edges remain as boundary. Under this gluing, the images of the two vertical edges become a single boundary component: their endpoints are identified via $(0,0) \\sim (1,1)$ and $(0,1) \\sim (1,0)$, so traversing the left edge from $(0,0)$ to $(0,1)$ continues along the right edge from $(1,1)$ to $(1,0)$, yielding one boundary circle. This is precisely the boundary behavior of the Möbius strip.\n\nConsequently, among the listed standard spaces:\n- Not $S^1 \\times [0,1]$ (cylinder), because that requires $(x,0) \\sim (x,1)$ (orientation preserved).\n- Not $S^1 \\times S^1$ (torus), because the vertical edges are not glued.\n- Yes, the Möbius strip, obtained exactly by $(x,0) \\sim (1-x,1)$ with vertical edges free.\n- Not the Klein bottle, which would require additionally gluing the vertical edges (with an appropriate twist).\n- Not $S^2$, which is closed and cannot arise from this single twisted gluing.\n\nTherefore, $X/\\sim$ is homeomorphic to the Möbius strip.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1668327"}, {"introduction": "Beyond gluing boundaries, quotient topology allows us to collapse an entire region or subspace of a space into a single point.

The space $X = S^2/\\sim$ consists of points which are the equivalence classes under the relation $\\sim$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the equivalence classes.\n- For any point $p \\in S^2$ that is not on the equator (i.e., $p \\notin E$), the only point equivalent to $p$ is $p$ itself. So, its equivalence class is the singleton set $\\{p\\}$.\n- For any point $p \\in E$, its equivalence class contains all other points on the equator. Thus, the entire equator $E$ forms a single equivalence class, which we can denote as $[E]$.\n\nTo understand the resulting space, we can decompose the sphere $S^2$ into three parts: the open northern hemisphere $H_N = \\{(x,y,z) \\in S^2 \\mid z > 0\\}$, the open southern hemisphere $H_S = \\{(x,y,z) \\in S^2 \\mid z < 0\\}$, and the equator $E = \\{(x,y,z) \\in S^2 \\mid z = 0\\}$.\n\nLet's consider the closure of the northern hemisphere, $\\overline{H_N} = H_N \\cup E$. Topologically, $\\overline{H_N}$ is a closed hemisphere, which is homeomorphic to a closed 2-dimensional disk, $D^2$. The boundary of this disk is the equator $E$, which is homeomorphic to a circle, $S^1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of the quotient map on this closed northern hemisphere. The map identifies all points on its boundary, $E$, to a single point, $[E]$. All points in the interior, $H_N$, are left unchanged relative to each other.\nSo, we are taking a closed disk $D^2$ and collapsing its entire boundary circle to a single point. This is a standard construction for the 2-sphere, $S^2$. A common way to visualize this is to imagine a flat, circular piece of cloth (the disk). If you pull the entire drawstring edge (the boundary) together to a single point, you form a bag-like shape which is topologically a sphere. So, the image of $\\overline{H_N}$ under the quotient map is a space homeomorphic to $S^2$.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider the closure of the southern hemisphere, $\\overline{H_S} = H_S \\cup E$. This is also homeomorphic to a closed 2-dimensional disk, $D^2$, with its boundary being the equator $E$.\nThe quotient map has the same effect on this part of the original space: it collapses the boundary $E$ of the disk $\\overline{H_S}$ to the single point $[E]$. This process also creates a space homeomorphic to a 2-sphere, $S^2$.\n\nThe final quotient space $X$ is constructed from both the northern and southern hemispheres. The interior points of the northern hemisphere form one part of $X$, and the interior points of the southern hemisphere form another. The two parts are joined together at the single point $[E]$ which is the image of the equator they both share as a boundary.\n\nTherefore, the space $X$ is formed by taking the two spheres we just constructed (one from the northern hemisphere, one from the southern) and identifying them at a single point (the point corresponding to the collapsed equator). This operation of joining two topological spaces at a single point is known as the wedge sum.\n\nSince we started with two disk-like halves that each became a 2-sphere after collapsing their common boundary, the resulting space is the wedge sum of two 2-spheres. This is denoted as $S^2 \\vee S^2$.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA. A single 2-sphere, $S^2$: Incorrect. This would happen if we collapsed, for instance, a meridian arc, but not the equator which separates the sphere into two distinct pieces.\nB. A torus, $T^2$: Incorrect. A torus has a fundamentally different structure (e.g., its fundamental group is $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, while that of $S^2 \\vee S^2$ is trivial).\nC. The wedge sum of two 2-spheres, $S^2 \\vee S^2$: Correct. This matches our derivation. The space is often visualized as two spheres tangent at a single point.\nD. The Cartesian product of two 2-spheres, $S^2 \\times S^2$: Incorrect. This is a 4-dimensional manifold.\nE. A single circle, $S^1$: Incorrect. The resulting space is 2-dimensional.\nF. The wedge sum of two circles, $S^1 \\vee S^1$: Incorrect. This is a \"figure-eight\" shape. It would be obtained, for example, by collapsing two points on a single circle to a point.\n\nThus, the space $X = S^2/\\sim$ is homeomorphic to $S^2 \\vee S^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1659623"}, {"introduction": "While geometric intuition is vital, the rigor of quotient topology rests on precise formal definitions.
