## Introduction
In the study of topology, understanding the structure of a space goes far beyond simply classifying subsets as open or not. To delve deeper, we must develop a precise language to describe proximity, boundaries, and the notion of completeness. This article introduces the fundamental concepts of limit points and closed sets, which formalize the intuitive idea of a point being "arbitrarily close" to a set. By mastering these tools, we can rigorously define what it means for a set to be self-contained, without any "missing" boundary points, and explore the crucial property of density, where a subset effectively "fills" an entire space.

This article will guide you through the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of these concepts across three chapters. In "Principles and Mechanisms," you will learn the rigorous definitions of [limit points](@entry_id:140908), closed sets, and the [closure of a set](@entry_id:143367), along with powerful criteria for proving a set is closed. Next, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate the remarkable utility of these ideas, showing how they provide critical insights into fields such as linear algebra, [functional analysis](@entry_id:146220), and dynamical systems. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will offer you the opportunity to apply your knowledge to solve concrete problems, solidifying your understanding of these essential topological tools.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In our exploration of topological spaces, we move beyond the simple classification of sets as open or not open. The structure of a space is deeply revealed by how points relate to sets, particularly by the notion of proximity. This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of [limit points](@entry_id:140908) and closed sets, which provide a precise language for describing the boundaries and completeness of subsets within a topological space.

### Defining Proximity: Limit Points

The intuitive idea of a point being "arbitrarily close" to a set, even if it is not part of the set itself, is formalized by the concept of a **[limit point](@entry_id:136272)**, also known as an accumulation point.

A point $p$ in a topological space $X$ is a **limit point** of a subset $A \subseteq X$ if every open set containing $p$ also contains at least one point of $A$ that is different from $p$. This condition ensures that $p$ is not "isolated" from $A$; one can always find points of $A$ as close to $p$ as desired. The set of all [limit points](@entry_id:140908) of $A$ is called the **derived set** of $A$, often denoted $A'$.

In the context of a [metric space](@entry_id:145912), where distance is defined, this definition becomes more concrete: a point $p$ is a limit point of $A$ if for every real number $\epsilon > 0$, the [open ball](@entry_id:141481) of radius $\epsilon$ centered at $p$, $B(p, \epsilon)$, contains a point of $A$ other than $p$.

Consider, for example, the half-open interval $S = [-3, \sqrt{2})$ in the real number line $\mathbb{R}$ with its standard topology [@problem_id:2290789]. Let's examine the point $p = \sqrt{2}$. For any $\epsilon > 0$, the [open interval](@entry_id:144029) $(\sqrt{2}-\epsilon, \sqrt{2}+\epsilon)$ is an open neighborhood of $\sqrt{2}$. Within this neighborhood, we can always find a real number $x$ such that $\sqrt{2}-\epsilon  x  \sqrt{2}$. Such a point $x$ belongs to the set $S$. Thus, every neighborhood of $\sqrt{2}$ contains a point of $S$ other than itself, making $\sqrt{2}$ a [limit point](@entry_id:136272) of $S$. Notice that in this case, the [limit point](@entry_id:136272) $\sqrt{2}$ is not an element of the set $S$.

In contrast, consider the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$ as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Does this set have any [limit points](@entry_id:140908)? Let's test an arbitrary real number $p$. If we choose $\epsilon = 1/2$, the [open interval](@entry_id:144029) $(p-1/2, p+1/2)$ can contain at most one integer. If it contains an integer $n \in \mathbb{N}$, that point must be $p$ itself (if $p$ is an integer) or another integer, but it cannot contain a point of $\mathbb{N}$ *other than* $p$ if we choose $\epsilon$ small enough (e.g., less than the distance to the nearest other natural number). Therefore, no point in $\mathbb{R}$ is a limit point of $\mathbb{N}$. The derived set of $\mathbb{N}$ is the [empty set](@entry_id:261946). Points of a set that are not limit points, such as any natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, are called **isolated points**. An [isolated point](@entry_id:146695) $a \in A$ is one for which there exists a neighborhood containing no other points of $A$.

### The Definition and Nature of Closed Sets

The concept of a limit point allows us to define a crucial [topological property](@entry_id:141605): being closed.

A set $A$ is **closed** if it contains all of its [limit points](@entry_id:140908). That is, $A$ is closed if $A' \subseteq A$.

Intuitively, a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) is one that you cannot "leak out of" by a process of approximation. If you can approach a point arbitrarily closely by using points from within the set, then that point must also belong to the set.

Let's revisit our examples:
-   The set $S = [-3, \sqrt{2})$ is **not closed**. As we established, $\sqrt{2}$ is a [limit point](@entry_id:136272) of $S$, but $\sqrt{2} \notin S$. The set fails to contain one of its limit points [@problem_id:2290789].
-   The set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ **is closed** in $\mathbb{R}$. We found that $\mathbb{N}$ has no [limit points](@entry_id:140908), so its derived set is $\emptyset$. The condition that a set must contain all its limit points, $\emptyset \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, is satisfied. This is a case of a **vacuously true** condition; the set is closed because the condition for being non-closed (having a limit point outside the set) cannot possibly be met [@problem_id:1286939].

It is a fundamental axiom of topology that in any [topological space](@entry_id:149165) $X$, both the empty set $\emptyset$ and the entire space $X$ are closed. The reasoning for this, based on our definition, is instructive [@problem_id:1287376].
-   The empty set $\emptyset$ has no points, and therefore it cannot have any limit points. Its [set of limit points](@entry_id:178514) is $\emptyset$. The condition for being closed, $\emptyset \subseteq \emptyset$, is trivially true.
-   The entire space $\mathbb{R}$ is closed. Any point $p \in \mathbb{R}$ is a [limit point](@entry_id:136272) of $\mathbb{R}$, because any [open interval](@entry_id:144029) around $p$ contains infinitely many other real numbers. Thus, the [set of limit points](@entry_id:178514) of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbb{R}$ itself. The condition $\mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is true, so $\mathbb{R}$ is closed.

### The Closure of a Set and the Concept of Density

If a set is not closed, it can be "completed" by adding all of its missing [limit points](@entry_id:140908). This larger set is known as the closure.

The **closure** of a set $A$, denoted $\bar{A}$, is the union of the set with its derived set: $\bar{A} = A \cup A'$. Equivalently, the closure of $A$ is the smallest [closed set](@entry_id:136446) that contains $A$. A point $p$ is in the closure of $A$ if and only if every [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) of $p$ has a non-empty intersection with $A$. A set $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \bar{A}$.

This leads to the vital concept of density. A set $A$ is said to be **dense** in a space $X$ if its closure is the entire space, i.e., $\bar{A} = X$. This means that any point in the space can be arbitrarily well-approximated by points from the [dense subset](@entry_id:150508).

The rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ are the canonical example of a [dense subset](@entry_id:150508) of the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. However, other subsets can also be dense.
-   Consider the set of **[dyadic rationals](@entry_id:148903)**, $D = \{ m/2^n \mid m \in \mathbb{Z}, n \in \mathbb{N}_0 \}$ [@problem_id:1640094]. For any real number $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and any $\epsilon > 0$, we can choose $n$ large enough such that $2^{-n}  \epsilon$. By finding an integer $m$ such that $m \le 2^n x  m+1$, we can construct a dyadic rational $d = m/2^n$ for which $|x-d|  2^{-n}  \epsilon$. This shows that every neighborhood of any real number $x$ contains a point from $D$. Therefore, the closure of $D$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$, and $D$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

-   Density can appear in more abstract settings. Consider the set $A$ of all vertices of regular $n$-gons inscribed in the unit circle $S^1 \subset \mathbb{C}$ for all $n \ge 3$ [@problem_id:1640065]. These points correspond to $e^{i\theta}$ where the angle $\theta$ is a rational multiple of $2\pi$. The set of such angles is dense in $[0, 2\pi)$. Consequently, for any point $p$ on the unit circle, any open arc around $p$ will contain a vertex from some $V_n$. This implies that every point on the circle is a [limit point](@entry_id:136272) of $A$. The [set of limit points](@entry_id:178514) of $A$ is the entire circle $S^1$, and thus the closure of $A$ is $S^1$.

-   The concept of closure is highly dependent on the topology of the space. Consider the set of [irrational numbers](@entry_id:158320), $S = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$, on the **Sorgenfrey line** $\mathbb{R}_l$, where the topology is generated by basis sets of the form $[a,b)$ [@problem_id:1640052]. To find the closure of $S$, we ask which points $x \in \mathbb{R}$ have the property that every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $S$. A basic neighborhood of $x$ is an interval $[x, x+\epsilon)$ for some $\epsilon > 0$. Since the [irrational numbers](@entry_id:158320) are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ in the usual sense, any interval $(x, x+\epsilon)$ contains an irrational number. This irrational number is also in $[x, x+\epsilon)$. Therefore, every basic neighborhood of any real number $x$ intersects $S$, which means the closure of the irrationals in the Sorgenfrey line is all of $\mathbb{R}$.

-   In higher dimensions, density can lead to interesting results. The set $S$ of points $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ where the ratio $x/y$ is rational is dense in the entire plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ [@problem_id:1640057]. Any point $(x_0, y_0)$ with $y_0 \neq 0$ can be approximated by a sequence of points $(q_n y_0, y_0)$ where $q_n$ is a sequence of rational numbers converging to the real number $x_0/y_0$. Furthermore, any point on the $x$-axis, $(x_0, 0)$, can also be shown to be a limit point of $S$. This demonstrates that $\bar{S} = \mathbb{R}^2$.

### The Sequential Criterion for Closed Sets

In metric spaces, and more generally in spaces where every point has a countable [neighborhood basis](@entry_id:148053) (first-countable spaces), there is an alternative and often more practical way to characterize closed sets using sequences.

A set $A$ in a metric space is **closed** if and only if for every sequence $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ of points in $A$ that converges to a limit $L$, the limit $L$ is also an element of $A$.

This criterion provides a powerful computational tool. To show a set is not closed, one only needs to find a single sequence within the set whose limit lies outside.

Let's see this in action:
-   Consider the set $A$ of real roots of the polynomials $p_n(x) = x^n - 2$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ [@problem_id:1640055]. This set includes the sequence $x_n = 2^{1/n}$. As $n \to \infty$, the exponent $1/n \to 0$, and by the continuity of the [exponential function](@entry_id:161417), $x_n = \exp(\frac{\ln 2}{n}) \to \exp(0) = 1$. The sequence $(x_n)$ is in $A$, but its limit, $1$, is not, because $p_n(1) = 1-2 = -1 \neq 0$ for any $n$. This single sequence is enough to prove that $A$ is not a closed set. Similarly, the sequence of negative roots, $y_m = -2^{1/(2m)}$, converges to $-1$, which is also not in $A$. The limit points of $A$ are precisely $\{-1, 1\}$.

-   This sequential test is particularly useful in more abstract spaces, like spaces of matrices. Consider the space $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ of $2 \times 2$ [complex matrices](@entry_id:190650), where convergence is entry-wise. The [general linear group](@entry_id:141275) $GL(2, \mathbb{C})$ is the set of [invertible matrices](@entry_id:149769), i.e., those with a non-zero determinant. Consider the sequence of matrices $A_k = \begin{pmatrix} i/k   0 \\ 0  -i \end{pmatrix}$ [@problem_id:1640096]. For every $k \ge 1$, $\det(A_k) = (i/k)(-i) = 1/k \neq 0$, so each $A_k \in GL(2, \mathbb{C})$. However, the sequence converges to the limit matrix $A_\infty = \lim_{k\to\infty} A_k = \begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\ 0  -i \end{pmatrix}$. The determinant of the limit is $\det(A_\infty) = 0$. Since we have found a sequence in $GL(2, \mathbb{C})$ whose limit is not in $GL(2, \mathbb{C})$, we have proven that **$GL(2, \mathbb{C})$ is not a closed set**.

### Proving Sets are Closed via Continuous Functions

While the limit point and sequential definitions are fundamental, one of the most elegant and powerful methods for establishing that a set is closed involves continuous functions.

A function $f: X \to Y$ between two [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056) is **continuous** if the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) of every open set in $Y$ is an open set in $X$. An equivalent statement, and the one most useful for our current purpose, is that $f$ is continuous if and only if the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) of every **closed** set in $Y$ is a **closed** set in $X$.

This provides a high-level mechanism for identifying closed sets. If a set can be described as the collection of points where a continuous function takes on a value from a closed set, then it must be closed.

-   Consider the set $S$ of singular $2 \times 2$ real matrices [@problem_id:1640067]. A matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} a  b \\ c  d \end{pmatrix}$ is in $S$ if and only if its determinant is zero. The determinant map, $\det: M_2(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}$, is given by $\det(A) = ad-bc$. This is a polynomial function of the matrix entries. Since polynomial functions are continuous, the determinant map is continuous. The set $S$ is precisely the preimage of the singleton set $\{0\}$ under this map: $S = \det^{-1}(\{0\})$. In any Hausdorff space like $\mathbb{R}$, finite sets (and thus singletons) are closed. Since $\{0\}$ is a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) in $\mathbb{R}$ and the determinant function is continuous, its preimage $S$ must be a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) in $M_2(\mathbb{R})$.

-   This same logic applies to many important sets in mathematics. The **[special linear group](@entry_id:139538)** $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ is the set of matrices with determinant equal to 1 [@problem_id:1640096]. It can be expressed as $SL(2, \mathbb{C}) = \det^{-1}(\{1\})$. Since $\{1\}$ is a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) in $\mathbb{C}$ and the determinant map is continuous, $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ is a [closed subset](@entry_id:155133) of $M_2(\mathbb{C})$. This has an important consequence: by the [sequential criterion](@entry_id:158961), any convergent sequence of matrices from $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ must have its limit also in $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$. This explains why, in problem [@problem_id:1640096], the limit $B_\infty$ of the sequence $B_k \in SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ was guaranteed to be in $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$. The algebraic structure is preserved under topological limits precisely because the set is closed.
