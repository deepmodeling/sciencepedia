Because $|x_{0}|1$, values of $x$ in $(x_{0},b_{1})$ arbitrarily close to $x_{0}$ still satisfy $|x|1$, and for such $x$ the slice $S_{x}$ is nonempty; moreover, $(l,r)$ contains all $y$ for those $x$, so $(l,r)\\cap S\\neq\\varnothing$.\n- The case $a_{1}x_{0}=b_{1}$ is analogous, using $x\\in(a_{1},x_{0})$.\n\nTherefore, for $|x_{0}|1$, the condition $y_{0}\\in\\overline{S_{x_{0}}}$ is sufficient to ensure every lexicographic neighborhood of $(x_{0},y_{0})$ meets $S$.
