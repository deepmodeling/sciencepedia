Basis consists of $[a,b)$ with $ab$.\n- First-countable: For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the family $\\{[x, x + \\frac{1}{n}) : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is a countable local base.

Then $[x, x + \\frac{1}{n}) \\subseteq [a,b) \\subseteq U$.\n- Hausdorff: If $x \\ne y$ and, without loss of generality, $xy$, then $U = [x,y)$ and $V = [y, y + 1)$ are disjoint open sets with $x \\in U$ and $y \\in V$, so the space is Hausdorff.\n- Not second-countable: Suppose, to the contrary, that there is a countable base $\\mathcal{B}$.

Then $a_{n} \\le x$ (since $x \\in [a_{n}, b_{n})$) and $a_{n} \\ge x$ (since $[a_{n}, b_{n}) \\subseteq [x, x+1)$ requires $a_{n} \\ge x$), hence $a_{n} = x$, contradicting $x \\notin A$.
