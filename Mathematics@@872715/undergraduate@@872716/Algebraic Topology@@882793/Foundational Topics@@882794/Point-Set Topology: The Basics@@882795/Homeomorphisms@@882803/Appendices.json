All the functions provided in the options are affine transformations (a linear transformation followed by a translation), which are known to be continuous on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Their inverses, if they exist, are also affine and thus continuous. The main task is to verify that a given function $f$ actually maps the set $B_1$ bijectively onto the set $B_2$, and that $g$ is indeed its inverse.\n\nA standard and intuitive way to construct such a homeomorphism is through a three-step process:\n1.  **Translate $B_1$ to the origin:** We first define a translation $T_1$ that moves the center $x_1$ of $B_1$ to the origin $0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. This map is $T_1(y) = y - x_1$. This function maps the ball $B_1 = B(x_1, r_1)$ to the ball $B(0, r_1)$.\n2.  **Scale the radius:** Next, we scale the resulting ball, $B(0, r_1)$, so that its radius becomes $r_2$. This is achieved by a scaling map $S(u) = \\frac{r_2}{r_1} u$. This function maps the ball $B(0, r_1)$ to the ball $B(0, r_2)$. To see this, if $\\|u\\|  r_1$, then $\\|S(u)\\| = \\|\\frac{r_2}{r_1}u\\| = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\|u\\|  \\frac{r_2}{r_1}r_1 = r_2$.\n3.  **Translate to the final center:** Finally, we translate the scaled ball, $B(0, r_2)$, from the origin to the center $x_2$ of the target ball $B_2$. This translation is given by $T_2(v) = v + x_2$. This function maps the ball $B(0, r_2)$ to the ball $B(x_2, r_2) = B_2$.\n\nThe desired homeomorphism $f: B_1 \\to B_2$ is the composition of these three maps: $f = T_2 \\circ S \\circ T_1$. Let's write out the explicit formula for $f(y)$ where $y \\in B_1$:\n$$f(y) = T_2(S(T_1(y))) = T_2(S(y - x_1)) = T_2\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}(y - x_1)\\right) = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}(y - x_1) + x_2$$\nThis function maps $B_1$ to $B_2$.\n\nNow, let's find the inverse function $g = f^{-1}: B_2 \\to B_1$. We set $z = f(y)$ and solve for $y$:\n$$z = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}(y - x_1) + x_2$$\n$$z - x_2 = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}(y - x_1)$$\n$$\\frac{r_1}{r_2}(z - x_2) = y - x_1$$\n$$y = \\frac{r_1}{r_2}(z - x_2) + x_1$$\nSo, the inverse function is $g(z) = \\frac{r_1}{r_2}(z - x_2) + x_1$.\n\nBoth $f$ and $g$ are affine transformations and are therefore continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Our construction guarantees that $f$ maps $B_1$ to $B_2$ and $g$ maps $B_2$ to $B_1$, and they are inverses of each other. Thus, they form a homeomorphism between the two open balls.\n\nNow we check the given options:\n*   **A. $f(y) = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}(y - x_1) + x_2$ and $g(z) = \\frac{r_1}{r_2}(z - x_2) + x_1$.** This pair exactly matches our derived functions $f$ and $g$. This is the correct choice.\n\nLet's briefly examine why the other options are incorrect.\n*   **B. $f(y) = \\frac{r_1}{r_2}(y - x_1) + x_2$ and $g(z) = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}(z - x_2) + x_1$.** Here, the scaling factor is inverted in $f$. Let's check where a point $y \\in B_1$ is mapped. For such a $y$, we have $\\|y - x_1\\|  r_1$. The distance of its image $f(y)$ from $x_2$ is $\\|f(y) - x_2\\| = \\|\\frac{r_1}{r_2}(y - x_1)\\| = \\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\|y-x_1\\|  \\frac{r_1}{r_2}r_1 = \\frac{r_1^2}{r_2}$. For $f(y)$ to be in $B_2$, we'd need its norm from the center to be less than $r_2$, i.e., $\\frac{r_1^2}{r_2}  r_2$. This is not true in general (e.g., if $r_1  r_2$). Therefore, this function does not necessarily map $B_1$ to $B_2$.\n*   **C. $f(y) = \\frac{r_2}{r_1} y + x_2$ and $g(z) = \\frac{r_1}{r_2}(z - x_2)$.** The function $f$ does not correctly account for the initial translation. For example, the center $x_1$ of $B_1$ is mapped to $f(x_1) = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}x_1 + x_2$, which is not the center $x_2$ of $B_2$ unless $x_1=0$. Also, $f$ and $g$ are not inverses. $g(f(y)) = \\frac{r_1}{r_2}((\\frac{r_2}{r_1}y+x_2)-x_2) = y$. But $f(g(z)) = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}(z-x_2)) + x_2 = z-x_2+x_2=z$. They are inverses, but the mapping property of $f$ is flawed. $f$ maps $B(0, r_1)$ to $B(x_2, r_2)$, not $B(x_1, r_1)$ to $B(x_2, r_2)$.\n*   **D. $f(y) = (y - x_1) + x_2$ and $g(z) = (z - x_2) + x_1$.** This pair represents only translations. It lacks the scaling step. This function would be a homeomorphism between $B(x_1, r_1)$ and $B(x_2, r_1)$, but not $B(x_2, r_2)$ if $r_1 \\neq r_2$.\n*   **E. $f(y) = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}(y + x_1) + x_2$ and $g(z) = \\frac{r_1}{r_2}(z - x_2) - x_1$.** This function incorrectly uses $y+x_1$ instead of $y-x_1$ for the initial centering step. This would be the correct map from a ball centered at $-x_1$ to $B_2$.\n\nTherefore, only option A provides the correct pair of functions for the homeomorphism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1556991"}, {"introduction": "Just as important as proving two spaces are homeomorphic is proving that they are not.
