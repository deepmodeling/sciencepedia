The concept of homeomorphism makes this precise, defining when two spaces are \"topologically the same.\" This practice asks whether the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ are homeomorphic [@problem_id:1692427]. To answer this, you will need to identify a topological property that one space possesses but the other does not, illustrating the powerful method of using topological invariants to distinguish between spaces.", "problem": "In point-set topology, we study the properties of spaces that are preserved under continuous deformations. A central concept is that of a homeomorphism, which formalizes the notion of two spaces being \"topologically equivalent.\"\n\nConsider two distinct topological spaces constructed from familiar sets of numbers.\nThe first space, let's call it $X$, is the set of all rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its topology is the subspace topology inherited from the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$, with its usual (metric) topology. This means a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}$ is open in $X$ if and only if $S = U \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ for some open set $U$ in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe second space, let's call it $Y$, is the set of all integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. Its topology is the discrete topology. In the discrete topology, every subset of $\\mathbb{Z}$ is considered an open set.\n\nRecall that a homeomorphism between two topological spaces is a bijection that is continuous and has a continuous inverse.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the topological spaces $X$ and $Y$?\n\nA. $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic because they are both countably infinite sets.\n\nB. $X$ and $Y$ are not homeomorphic because one space has a local topological property related to isolated points that the other space lacks.\n\nC. $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic because any bijection between two countable sets can be chosen to be a homeomorphism if the topologies are defined appropriately.\n\nD. $X$ and $Y$ are not homeomorphic because, as subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense while $\\mathbb{Z}$ is closed.\n\nE. Whether $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic is an open problem in topology.", "solution": "We consider $X=(\\mathbb{Q},\\tau_{X})$ where $\\tau_{X}$ is the subspace topology inherited from $(\\mathbb{R},\\tau_{\\mathbb{R}})$, and $Y=(\\mathbb{Z},\\tau_{Y})$ where $\\tau_{Y}$ is the discrete topology.\n\nA point $x$ in a topological space $(S,\\tau)$ is called isolated if $\\{x\\}\\in\\tau$. This is a purely topological (intrinsic) property. A homeomorphism preserves isolated points: if $f:(S,\\tau)\\to(S',\\tau')$ is a homeomorphism and $x$ is isolated in $S$, then $\\{x\\}$ is open in $S$, so $f(\\{x\\})=\\{f(x)\\}$ is open in $S'$; hence $f(x)$ is isolated in $S'$. Conversely, $f^{-1}$ shows isolated points in $S'$ come from isolated points in $S$.\n\nIn $Y$ (discrete topology), for any $z\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ we have $\\{z\\}\\in\\tau_{Y}$ by definition. Therefore every point of $Y$ is isolated.\n\nIn $X$ (subspace topology from $\\mathbb{R}$), no point is isolated. To see this, fix $q\\in\\mathbb{Q}$. Suppose for contradiction that $\\{q\\}\\in\\tau_{X}$. Then, by the definition of subspace topology, there exists $U\\in\\tau_{\\mathbb{R}}$ such that $\\{q\\}=U\\cap\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $U$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}$ and $q\\in U$, there exists $\\epsilon0$ such that $(q-\\epsilon,q+\\epsilon)\\subset U$. But $(q-\\epsilon,q+\\epsilon)\\cap\\mathbb{Q}$ contains infinitely many rational numbers besides $q$, so $U\\cap\\mathbb{Q}$ cannot equal $\\{q\\}$, a contradiction. Hence no singleton $\\{q\\}$ is open in $X$, and $X$ has no isolated points.\n\nBecause the property “has an isolated point” is preserved by homeomorphisms and $Y$ has isolated points while $X$ does not, there cannot be a homeomorphism $X\\to Y$. This directly validates option B.\n\nFor completeness regarding the other options:\n- A is false because equal cardinality does not imply homeomorphism; topology matters.\n- C is false in this context because the topologies are fixed; one cannot freely adjust them to make an arbitrary bijection a homeomorphism.\n- D provides an extrinsic reason involving how these sets sit inside $\\mathbb{R}$. Being dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ or closed in $\\mathbb{R}$ is not an invariant of the abstract topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ under homeomorphism; thus this justification is not valid for deciding homeomorphism between $X$ and $Y$ as abstract spaces.\n- E is false; the question is not open and is resolved by the isolated point argument above.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1692427"}]}
