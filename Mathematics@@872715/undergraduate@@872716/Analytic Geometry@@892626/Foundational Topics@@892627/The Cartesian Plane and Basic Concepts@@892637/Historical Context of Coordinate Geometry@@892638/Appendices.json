A central technique he employed was the transformation of coordinates to simplify complex equations and reveal the true nature of a curve. This exercise guides you through this foundational process, demonstrating how a rotation of axes can eliminate the cross-product term ($xy$) and standardize the equation of a conic section, making its geometric properties immediately apparent [@problem_id:2136459].", "problem": "In the mid-17th century, the Dutch mathematician Jan de Witt, in his work *Elementa Curvarum Linearum*, developed a systematic method for analyzing and classifying curves described by second-degree equations in two variables. This was a foundational step in analytic geometry, moving beyond the case-by-case analysis of conic sections inherited from the Greeks. De Witt's method involved transforming the coordinate system to simplify the equation, revealing the curve's true nature.\n\nConsider the general second-degree equation $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$. De Witt recognized that the $xy$ term, known as the cross-term, indicated that the principal axes of the conic were not aligned with the coordinate axes. His key insight was to introduce a new coordinate system $(u, v)$ that is rotated with respect to the original $(x, y)$ system, such that in the new system, the cross-term vanishes.\n\nYour task is to apply the spirit of de Witt's geometric method to a specific curve. Consider the equation of a rectangular hyperbola given by $xy = k^2$, where $k$ is a non-zero real constant. Introduce a new coordinate system $(u, v)$ with the same origin, where the $u$-axis is the line $y=x$ and the $v$-axis is the line $y=-x$.\n\nBy expressing the original coordinates $x$ and $y$ in terms of the new coordinates $u$ and $v$ and substituting them into the equation, transform the equation into a form without a cross-term. This new equation can be written in the standard form for a hyperbola, $\\frac{u^2}{a^2} - \\frac{v^2}{b^2} = 1$.\n\nDetermine the value of the parameter $a^2$ in terms of the constant $k$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to transform the equation $xy = k^2$ into a new coordinate system $(u, v)$ and then find the value of $a^2$ from its standard form. The new $u$-axis is defined by the line $y=x$, and the new $v$-axis is defined by the line $y=-x$. These axes are perpendicular to each other, forming a valid Cartesian coordinate system rotated with respect to the original $(x, y)$ system.\n\nOur first step is to find the relationship between the coordinates $(x, y)$ and $(u, v)$. A point $P$ in the plane has coordinates $(x, y)$ in the original system and $(u, v)$ in the new system. The coordinate $u$ represents the signed perpendicular distance from the point $P$ to the $v$-axis ($y=-x$, or $x+y=0$), and the coordinate $v$ represents the signed perpendicular distance from $P$ to the $u$-axis ($y=x$, or $x-y=0$).\n\nLet's consider a point $P(x,y)$. The vector from the origin to this point is $\\vec{p} = x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j}$.\nThe unit vector along the new $u$-axis (the line $y=x$) is $\\hat{u} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\hat{i} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\hat{j}$.\nThe unit vector along the new $v$-axis (the line $y=-x$) is $\\hat{v} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\hat{i} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\hat{j}$.\n\nThe new coordinates $(u, v)$ are the projections of the position vector $\\vec{p}$ onto the new basis vectors $\\hat{u}$ and $\\hat{v}$.\n$u = \\vec{p} \\cdot \\hat{u} = (x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j}) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\hat{i} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\hat{j}) = \\frac{x+y}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n$v = \\vec{p} \\cdot \\hat{v} = (x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j}) \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\hat{i} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\hat{j}) = \\frac{-x+y}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThese equations give the new coordinates $(u,v)$ in terms of the old coordinates $(x,y)$. To transform the equation $xy=k^2$, we need the inverse relationship: $(x,y)$ in terms of $(u,v)$. We can solve the system of linear equations for $x$ and $y$:\n1) $\\sqrt{2}u = x+y$\n2) $\\sqrt{2}v = -x+y$\n\nAdding equation (1) and (2):\n$\\sqrt{2}u + \\sqrt{2}v = (x+y) + (-x+y) = 2y$\n$y = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(u+v)}{2} = \\frac{u+v}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nSubtracting equation (2) from equation (1):\n$\\sqrt{2}u - \\sqrt{2}v = (x+y) - (-x+y) = 2x$\n$x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(u-v)}{2} = \\frac{u-v}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThese are the transformation equations for the coordinates. This corresponds to a rotation of the axes by $\\theta = 45^\\circ$ or $\\pi/4$ radians.\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $x$ and $y$ into the original equation $xy = k^2$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{u-v}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{u+v}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = k^2 $$\n\nWe simplify the left side of the equation. The numerator is a difference of squares $(u-v)(u+v) = u^2 - v^2$. The denominator is $(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{2}) = 2$.\n$$ \\frac{u^2 - v^2}{2} = k^2 $$\n\nTo put this into the standard form for a hyperbola, $\\frac{u^2}{a^2} - \\frac{v^2}{b^2} = 1$, we first multiply both sides by 2:\n$$ u^2 - v^2 = 2k^2 $$\n\nNext, we divide the entire equation by the constant term on the right side, $2k^2$. Since $k$ is non-zero, $2k^2$ is also non-zero.\n$$ \\frac{u^2}{2k^2} - \\frac{v^2}{2k^2} = 1 $$\n\nBy comparing this equation to the standard form $\\frac{u^2}{a^2} - \\frac{v^2}{b^2} = 1$, we can directly identify the values of $a^2$ and $b^2$.\nWe see that $a^2 = 2k^2$ and $b^2 = 2k^2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $a^2$ in terms of $k$.\nTherefore, $a^2 = 2k^2$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2k^{2}} $$", "id": "2136459"}, {"introduction": "The development of analytic geometry was a crucial stepping stone to calculus, as it provided the framework to tackle the problem of finding tangents to curves.
