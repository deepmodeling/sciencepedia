Let $\\beta$ be the acute angle of inclination of the line $L$ with respect to the $xy$-plane.\n\nThe key insight to solving this problem lies in the geometric relationship between a line, a plane containing that line, and a reference plane. A fundamental principle of three-dimensional geometry states that the angle of inclination of any line lying within a plane $\\Pi$ (with respect to a reference plane) must be less than or equal to the angle of inclination of the plane $\\Pi$ itself.\n\nIn our case, the line $L$ lies within any of the planes $\\Pi$ from the family of planes being considered. Therefore, the angle of inclination of $L$ with respect to the $xy$-plane, $\\beta$, must be less than or equal to the angle between any such plane $\\Pi$ and the $xy$-plane, $\\theta$. This can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\beta \\le \\theta\n$$\nThis inequality holds for every plane $\\Pi$ that contains the line $L$. Consequently, the minimum possible value for the angle $\\theta$ is $\\beta$. We can achieve this minimum angle. The plane for which $\\theta = \\beta$ is the one that contains the line $L$ and is maximally \"aligned\" with it, i.e., the plane containing $L$ and its projection onto the $xy$-plane.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the angle of inclination, $\\beta$, of the line $L$ with the $xy$-plane.\n\nThe angle $\\beta$ between a line with direction vector $\\vec{v}$ and a plane with normal vector $\\vec{n}$ is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\sin(\\beta) = \\frac{|\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}|}{\\|\\vec{v}\\| \\|\\vec{n}\\|}\n$$\nFirst, we identify the direction vector of the line $L$ from its parametric equations $x = 1 + 4t$, $y = 2 + 5t$, and $z = 3 + 6t$. The components multiplying the parameter $t$ give the direction vector:\n$$\n\\vec{v} = \\langle 4, 5, 6 \\rangle\n$$\nNext, we identify the normal vector to the $xy$-plane given by the equation $z=0$ (or $0x+0y+1z=0$).
