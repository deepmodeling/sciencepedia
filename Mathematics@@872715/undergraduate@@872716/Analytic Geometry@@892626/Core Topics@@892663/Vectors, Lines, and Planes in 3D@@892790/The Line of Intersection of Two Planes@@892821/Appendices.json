We will first determine the equation of each plane and then find their line of intersection.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the equation of plane $\\Pi_1$.**\nThe plane $\\Pi_1$ passes through the origin $O(0,0,0)$, point $A(2, 4, -2)$, and point $B(4, -2, 6)$. Two vectors lying in this plane are $\\vec{OA}$ and $\\vec{OB}$.\nLet $\\vec{a} = \\vec{OA} = \\langle 2, 4, -2 \\rangle$ and $\\vec{b} = \\vec{OB} = \\langle 4, -2, 6 \\rangle$.\nA normal vector to the plane $\\Pi_1$, denoted by $\\vec{n}_1$, can be found by taking the cross product of these two vectors:\n$$ \\vec{n}_1 = \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 2 & 4 & -2 \\\\ 4 & -2 & 6 \\end{vmatrix} $$\n$$ \\vec{n}_1 = \\mathbf{i}(4 \\cdot 6 - (-2) \\cdot (-2)) - \\mathbf{j}(2 \\cdot 6 - (-2) \\cdot 4) + \\mathbf{k}(2 \\cdot (-2) - 4 \\cdot 4) $$\n$$ \\vec{n}_1 = \\mathbf{i}(24 - 4) - \\mathbf{j}(12 + 8) + \\mathbf{k}(-4 - 16) $$\n$$ \\vec{n}_1 = \\langle 20, -20, -20 \\rangle $$\nWe can use any non-zero scalar multiple of this vector as the normal vector. To simplify, we can divide by 20, yielding the normal vector $\\vec{n}_1 = \\langle 1, -1, -1 \\rangle$.\nThe equation of a plane is given by $\\vec{n} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_0) = 0$, where $\\vec{r}_0$ is the position vector of a point on the plane.

This means it passes through the midpoint of $AB$ and its normal vector is parallel to the vector $\\vec{AB}$.\nFirst, we find the midpoint $M$ of the segment $AB$:\n$$ M = \\left( \\frac{2+4}{2}, \\frac{4+(-2)}{2}, \\frac{-2+6}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{6}{2}, \\frac{2}{2}, \\frac{4}{2} \\right) = (3, 1, 2) $$\nNext, we find the vector $\\vec{AB}$, which will serve as a normal vector $\\vec{n}_2$ for plane $\\Pi_2$:\n$$ \\vec{n}_2 = \\vec{AB} = B - A = \\langle 4-2, -2-4, 6-(-2) \\rangle = \\langle 2, -6, 8 \\rangle $$\nWe can simplify this normal vector by dividing by 2, yielding $\\vec{n}_2 = \\langle 1, -3, 4 \\rangle$.\nThe equation for plane $\\Pi_2$ passing through point $M(3, 1, 2)$ with normal $\\vec{n}_2$ is:\n$$ 1(x - 3) - 3(y - 1) + 4(z - 2) = 0 $$\n$$ x - 3 - 3y + 3 + 4z - 8 = 0 $$\n$$ \\Pi_2: x - 3y + 4z - 8 = 0 $$\n\n**Step 3: Find the line of intersection of $\\Pi_1$ and $\\Pi_2$.**\nThe line of intersection, $L$, is common to both planes.

Let's use $\\vec{d} = \\langle 7, 5, 2 \\rangle$.\n\nNow, we need to find a point $P_0$ that lies on this line, meaning it must satisfy both plane equations:\n1) $x - y - z = 0$\n2) $x - 3y + 4z = 8$\nWe can find a point by setting one of the variables to a constant.
