The formula for $\\cos(\\psi)$ becomes:\n$$ \\cos(\\psi) = \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{d'} $$\nNow, we compute the dot product:\n$$ \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{d'} = \\vec{d} \\cdot (\\vec{d} - 2(\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{n})\\vec{n}) $$\n$$ \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{d'} = \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{d} - 2(\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{n})(\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{n}) $$\n$$ \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{d'} = \\|\\vec{d}\\|^2 - 2(\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 $$\nSince $\\|\\vec{d}\\|=1$, we have:\n$$ \\cos(\\psi) = 1 - 2(\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 $$\nFrom our initial definition, we know that $\\sin(\\alpha) = |\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{n}|$.
