The laser beam can be modeled as a straight line originating from a source at point $L_1 = (1, 2, 8)$ and aimed towards a target sensor at point $L_2 = (4, -4, 2)$. The component is positioned such that its surface forms a plane that is perfectly perpendicular to the direction of the laser beam. For a calibration check, the plane must also contain a specific reference point, $P_0$. This reference point is the geometric center of a calibration fixture, defined as the midpoint of the line segment connecting the points $S_1 = (5, 0, 3)$ and $S_2 = (1, -4, 7)$.
