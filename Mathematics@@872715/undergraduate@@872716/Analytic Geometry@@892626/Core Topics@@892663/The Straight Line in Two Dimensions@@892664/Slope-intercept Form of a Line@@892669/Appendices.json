This exercise challenges you to deconstruct existing linear equations to extract their essential properties—slope and y-intercept—and then use this information to construct a new line.

Line 1 is described by the equation $4x + 2y = 5$. Line 2 is described by the equation $y = x - 7$. A third line, Line 3, is parallel to Line 1 and has the same y-intercept as Line 2. The equation for Line 3 can be expressed in the standard form $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integers with a greatest common divisor of 1, and $A$ is positive. Determine the values for the coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$.", "solution": "Line 1 is given by $4x + 2y = 5$.
