Since a vertical line is perpendicular to a horizontal line, the angle at $A$ is a right angle. In a right triangle, the orthocenter is at the right-angled vertex because the altitude from each of the other two vertices coincides with the corresponding leg:\n- The altitude from $B$ to side $AC$ is the line perpendicular to $AC: y=-2$, hence the vertical line through $B$, which is $x=4$.\n- The altitude from $C$ to side $AB$ is the line perpendicular to $AB: x=4$, hence the horizontal line through $C$, which is $y=-2$.\n\nThese two altitudes intersect at the solution of $x=4$ and $y=-2$, namely at $A=(4,-2)$.
