This normal line intersects the y-axis at the point $(0, b)$. Determine the value of $b$.", "solution": "Let the circle have center $(h,k)$ and radius $r$. Being tangent to the x-axis and lying entirely in the upper half-plane implies the lowest point of the circle touches the x-axis, so the center’s y-coordinate equals the radius: $k = r$ with $r > 0$. Hence the center is $(h,r)$.\n\nBecause the circle passes through $P_{1} = (1,8)$ and $P_{2} = (9,8)$, their distances to the center equal $r$:\n$$\n(1 - h)^{2} + (8 - r)^{2} = r^{2}, \\quad (9 - h)^{2} + (8 - r)^{2} = r^{2}.\n$$\nSubtracting the first from the second eliminates $(8 - r)^{2}$:\n$$\n(9 - h)^{2} - (1 - h)^{2} = 0.\n$$\nUsing the identity $A^{2} - B^{2} = (A - B)(A + B)$ with $A = 9 - h$ and $B = 1 - h$,\n$$\n[(9 - h) - (1 - h)]\\,[(9 - h) + (1 - h)] = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 8\\,(10 - 2h) = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; h = 5.\n$$\nSubstitute $h = 5$ into $(1 - h)^{2} + (8 - r)^{2} = r^{2}$:\n$$\n(1 - 5)^{2} + (8 - r)^{2} = r^{2} \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 16 + (8 - r)^{2} = r^{2}.\n$$\nExpand and simplify:\n$$\n16 + 64 - 16r + r^{2} = r^{2} \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 80 - 16r = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; r = 5.\n$$\nThus the center is $(5,5)$.
