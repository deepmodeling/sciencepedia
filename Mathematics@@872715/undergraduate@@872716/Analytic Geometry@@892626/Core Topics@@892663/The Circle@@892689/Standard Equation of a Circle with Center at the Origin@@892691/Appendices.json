It models its operational area as a 2D Cartesian plane, where the origin $(0,0)$ corresponds to its central deployment beacon.

It detects a long, straight hydrothermal vent, which it models as a line segment.

The submersible also measures that the closest point on this vent to its own position is at a distance $d$. The vent is located at a y-coordinate greater than $y_p$. Find an expression for the total length of the vent in terms of $R$, $y_p$, and $d$.", "solution": "Let the 2D Cartesian plane be the standard xy-plane. The circular operational boundary is centered at the origin and has a radius $R$. Its equation is given by $x^2 + y^2 = R^2$.\n\nThe submersible is at position $P = (x_p, y_p)$.\n\nThe hydrothermal vent is described as a horizontal chord. A horizontal line has the equation $y=h$ for some constant $h$.\n\nWe are given that the closest point on the vent to the submersible is at a distance $d$. Let the line equation for the vent be $y=h$. The point on this line that is closest to $P(x_p, y_p)$ is the point $Q$ which is the orthogonal projection of $P$ onto the line $y=h$. For a horizontal line, this means the point $Q$ must have the same x-coordinate as $P$. Thus, the coordinates of $Q$ are $(x_p, h)$.\n\nThe distance between $P(x_p, y_p)$ and $Q(x_p, h)$ is given by the distance formula:\n$$d = \\sqrt{(x_p - x_p)^2 + (h - y_p)^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + (h - y_p)^2} = |h - y_p|$$\n\nThe problem states that the vent is located at a y-coordinate greater than the submersible's y-coordinate, which means $h > y_p$. Therefore, $h - y_p$ is positive, and we can write $|h - y_p| = h - y_p$.\nSo, we have $d = h - y_p$, which allows us to determine the y-coordinate of the vent:\n$$h = y_p + d$$\n\nNow we need to find the length of the chord formed by the intersection of the line $y = y_p + d$ and the circle $x^2 + y^2 = R^2$. To find the endpoints of the chord, we substitute the expression for $y$ into the circle's equation:\n$$x^2 + (y_p + d)^2 = R^2$$\n\nWe solve for $x$ to find the x-coordinates of the endpoints of the chord:\n$$x^2 = R^2 - (y_p + d)^2$$\n$$x = \\pm \\sqrt{R^2 - (y_p + d)^2}$$\n\nLet the two endpoints of the chord be $E_1$ and $E_2$.

Since they have the same y-coordinate, the length is simply the absolute difference of their x-coordinates:\n$$L = \\left| \\sqrt{R^2 - (y_p + d)^2} - \\left(-\\sqrt{R^2 - (y_p + d)^2}\\right) \\right|$$\n$$L = \\left| 2\\sqrt{R^2 - (y_p + d)^2} \\right|$$\n\nSince the square root function produces a non-negative value, the length is:\n$$L = 2\\sqrt{R^2 - (y_p + d)^2}$$\nThis is the final expression for the length of the vent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\sqrt{R^{2} - (y_{p}+d)^{2}}}$$", "id": "2159034"}]}
