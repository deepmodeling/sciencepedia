An opaque circular disk of radius $R_0$ is centered on the z-axis and placed in the plane $z=H$, where $H > 0$. The spotlight is aimed along the positive z-axis, and the disk casts a shadow for all locations with a z-coordinate greater than $H$. The boundary of this shadow is a surface formed by light rays that emanate from the origin and are tangent to the perimeter of the disk.
