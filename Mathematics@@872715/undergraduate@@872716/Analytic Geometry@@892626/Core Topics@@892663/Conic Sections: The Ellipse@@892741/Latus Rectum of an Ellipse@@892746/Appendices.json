This chord must pass through one of the foci and be oriented perpendicular to the ellipse's major axis.\n\nCalculate the length of this chord. Express your answer as an exact numerical value in millimeters.", "solution": "The goal is to find the length of the latus rectum of the ellipse defined by the given equation. First, we must convert the general form of the ellipse's equation into its standard form, $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$ or $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} = 1$, to identify its parameters.\n\nThe given equation is:\n$$9x^2 + 25y^2 + 36x - 50y - 164 = 0$$\n\nTo convert this to standard form, we use the method of completing the square. First, group the $x$ terms and $y$ terms and move the constant to the right side:\n$$(9x^2 + 36x) + (25y^2 - 50y) = 164$$\n\nFactor out the coefficients of the squared terms:\n$$9(x^2 + 4x) + 25(y^2 - 2y) = 164$$\n\nNow, complete the square for the expressions in the parentheses. For the $x$ terms, we take half of the coefficient of $x$ (which is 4), square it ($2^2=4$), and add it inside the parentheses. For the $y$ terms, we take half of the coefficient of $y$ (which is -2), square it (($-1)^2=1$), and add it inside the parentheses. To maintain equality, we must add the corresponding values to the right side of the equation. Remember to multiply these added values by the coefficients we factored out.\n$$9(x^2 + 4x + 4) + 25(y^2 - 2y + 1) = 164 + 9(4) + 25(1)$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n$$9(x+2)^2 + 25(y-1)^2 = 164 + 36 + 25$$\n$$9(x+2)^2 + 25(y-1)^2 = 225$$\n\nTo get the standard form, divide both sides by 225:\n$$\\frac{9(x+2)^2}{225} + \\frac{25(y-1)^2}{225} = 1$$\n\nSimplify the fractions:\n$$\\frac{(x+2)^2}{25} + \\frac{(y-1)^2}{9} = 1$$\n\nFrom this standard form, we can identify the semi-major axis $a$ and the semi-minor axis $b$. The larger denominator is $a^2$. Here, $a^2=25$ and $b^2=9$.\nThus, $a = \\sqrt{25} = 5$ and $b = \\sqrt{9} = 3$.\nSince $a^2$ is under the $x$ term, the major axis is horizontal.\n\nThe problem asks for the length of the chord passing through a focus and perpendicular to the major axis. This is the definition of the latus rectum of an ellipse. The length of the latus rectum, $L$, is given by the formula:\n$$L = \\frac{2b^2}{a}$$\n\nSubstituting the values of $a$ and $b^2$ that we found:\n$$L = \\frac{2(9)}{5}$$\n$$L = \\frac{18}{5}$$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$L = 3.6$$\n\nThe coordinates are given in millimeters, so the length of the chord is 3.6 mm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.6}$$", "id": "2142724"}, {"introduction": "Now that we can calculate the latus rectum from an ellipse's equation, let's explore its relationship with other key orbital parameters.
