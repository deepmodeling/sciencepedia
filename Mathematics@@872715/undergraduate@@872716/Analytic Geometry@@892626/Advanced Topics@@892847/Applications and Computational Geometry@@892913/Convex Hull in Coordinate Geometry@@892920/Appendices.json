For $P_{1}$, $P_{2}$, and $P_{3}$ we have $y_{1}=0$, $y_{2}=-1$, $y_{3}=0$, all strictly less than $1$, hence they lie below the line $P_{0}P_{4}$. Therefore $P_{0}$ and $P_{4}$ are vertices on the upper hull.\n\nNow examine the lower hull. Consider the line through $P_{0}$ and $P_{2}$. Its slope is\n$$m_{02}=\\frac{-1-1}{2\\pi-0}=-\\frac{2}{2\\pi}=-\\frac{1}{\\pi},$$\nso its equation through $P_{0}$ is\n$$y-1=-\\frac{1}{\\pi}(x-0)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad y=1-\\frac{x}{\\pi}.$$\nAt $x=\\pi$ (the $x$-coordinate of $P_{1}$), this gives $y=1-\\frac{\\pi}{\\pi}=0$, which equals $y_{1}$.
