Determine the matrix representation of $T$ with respect to the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.", "solution": "To find the matrix representation of the linear transformation $T$ with respect to the standard basis, we need to determine the images of the standard basis vectors under this transformation. The resulting image vectors will form the columns of the desired matrix, which we will denote as $A$. The standard basis vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are $\\mathbf{e}_1 = (1, 0, 0)$, $\\mathbf{e}_2 = (0, 1, 0)$, and $\\mathbf{e}_3 = (0, 0, 1)$.\n\nFirst, we find the image of the first basis vector, $T(\\mathbf{e}_1)$. The vector $\\mathbf{e}_1 = (1, 0, 0)$ corresponds to a point on the x-axis. Any point on the x-axis can be written as $(x_0, 0, 0)$. We check if these points lie on the plane of reflection, $y=z$. Substituting the coordinates into the plane equation gives $0=0$, which is always true. This shows that the entire x-axis is contained within the plane. Any vector lying in the plane of reflection is unchanged by the reflection. Thus, $T(\\mathbf{e}_1) = \\mathbf{e}_1 = (1, 0, 0)$. This gives us the first column of matrix $A$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we find the image of the second basis vector, $T(\\mathbf{e}_2)$. The vector $\\mathbf{e}_2 = (0, 1, 0)$ lies in the yz-plane (where $x=0$). Within the yz-plane, the plane of reflection $y=z$ becomes a line. The reflection of a point $(y_0, z_0)$ across the line $y=z$ is the point $(z_0, y_0)$. For the point corresponding to $\\mathbf{e}_2$, which is $(0, 1, 0)$ in 3D-space, its coordinates in the yz-plane are $(1, 0)$. The reflection is the point $(0, 1)$ in the yz-plane, which corresponds to the vector $(0, 0, 1)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, $T(\\mathbf{e}_2) = \\mathbf{e}_3 = (0, 0, 1)$. This gives us the second column of matrix $A$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nFinally, we find the image of the third basis vector, $T(\\mathbf{e}_3)$. The vector $\\mathbf{e}_3 = (0, 0, 1)$ also lies in the yz-plane. Using the same reasoning as for $\\mathbf{e}_2$, the point $(0, 0, 1)$ has coordinates $(0, 1)$ in the yz-plane. Its reflection across the line $y=z$ is the point $(1, 0)$ in the yz-plane, which corresponds to the vector $(0, 1, 0)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, $T(\\mathbf{e}_3) = \\mathbf{e}_2 = (0, 1, 0)$. This gives us the third column of matrix $A$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nCombining these column vectors in order, we construct the matrix representation $A$ of the transformation $T$:\n$$ A = [T(\\mathbf{e}_1) | T(\\mathbf{e}_2) | T(\\mathbf{e}_3)] = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nAs a check, we can see what this matrix does to a general vector $\\mathbf{v} = (x, y, z)$.\n$$ A\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot x + 0 \\cdot y + 0 \\cdot z \\\\ 0 \\cdot x + 0 \\cdot y + 1 \\cdot z \\\\ 0 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot y + 0 \\cdot z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ z \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe result is the vector $(x, z, y)$, which is indeed the reflection of $(x, y, z)$ across the plane $y=z$.
