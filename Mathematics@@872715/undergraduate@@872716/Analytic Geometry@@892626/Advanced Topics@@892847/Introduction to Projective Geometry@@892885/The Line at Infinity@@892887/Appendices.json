An affine point $(x, y)$ is represented by a 3-component vector $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ where $x = x_1/x_3$ and $y = x_2/x_3$, with $x_3 \\neq 0$. Typically, the point $(x, y)$ is mapped to $(x, y, 1)$. Points for which $x_3 = 0$, of the form $(d_x, d_y, 0)$, are called \"points at infinity\" and represent the direction of the vector $(d_x, d_y)$.

A point $D$ is the harmonic conjugate of a point $C$ with respect to a pair of points $(A, B)$ if their cross-ratio $(A, B; C, D)$ is equal to $-1$.
