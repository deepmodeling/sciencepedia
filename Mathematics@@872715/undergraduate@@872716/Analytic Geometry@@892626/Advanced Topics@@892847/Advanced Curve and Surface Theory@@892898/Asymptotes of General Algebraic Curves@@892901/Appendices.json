The general method for finding an oblique asymptote $y=mx+c$ for an algebraic curve of degree $n$ involves analyzing the homogeneous parts of the polynomial.\n\nFirst, we group the terms of the polynomial by their degree:\n- The terms of degree $n=3$ are $P_3(x,y) = x^3 + y^3$.\n- The terms of degree $n-1=2$ are $P_2(x,y) = 3x^2 - 3xy$.\n- The terms of degree $n-2=1$ are $P_1(x,y) = 5x - 7y$.\n- The constant term (degree 0) is $P_0(x,y) = 2$.\n\nThe slope $m$ of the asymptote is found by solving the equation $\\phi_n(m) = 0$, where $\\phi_k(m)$ is obtained by substituting $x=1$ and $y=m$ into the homogeneous polynomial $P_k(x,y)$.\n\nFor the highest degree terms ($n=3$), we have:\n$$\\phi_3(m) = P_3(1,m) = (1)^3 + (m)^3 = 1 + m^3$$\nSetting $\\phi_3(m) = 0$ to find the possible slopes:\n$$1 + m^3 = 0$$\n$$m^3 = -1$$\nThe only real root of this equation is $m = -1$.
