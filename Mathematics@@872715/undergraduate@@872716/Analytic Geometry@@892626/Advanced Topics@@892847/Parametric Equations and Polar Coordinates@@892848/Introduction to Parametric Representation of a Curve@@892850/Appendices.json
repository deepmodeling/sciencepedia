To find the parametric equations for $x$ and $y$ in terms of the parameter $m$, we first need to establish the equations for the two lines, $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n\nWe use the point-slope form of a linear equation, $y - y_1 = k(x - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and $k$ is the slope.\n\nFor line $L_1$, it passes through point $A(-a, 0)$ and has a slope of $m$.
