Not only must we be able to graph an equation, but we must also be able to deduce an equation from the geometric properties of its curve.

Furthermore, the curve passes through the point whose Cartesian coordinates are $(0, -6)$. Determine the expression for $f(\\theta)$.", "solution": "The general form of a polar equation for a cardioid is either $r = a(1 \\pm \\cos\\theta)$ or $r = a(1 \\pm \\sin\\theta)$, where $a$ is a positive constant.\n\nThe symmetry of the cardioid depends on the trigonometric function used:\n- Equations of the form $r = a(1 \\pm \\cos\\theta)$ are symmetric with respect to the polar axis (the line $\\theta = 0$).\n- Equations of the form $r = a(1 \\pm \\sin\\theta)$ are symmetric with respect to the line $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nThe problem states that the cardioid is symmetric with respect to the line $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, its equation must be of the form $f(\\theta) = a(1 \\pm \\sin\\theta)$.\n\nNext, we must use the information that the curve passes through the Cartesian point $(x, y) = (0, -6)$. We need to convert this point to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$. The radial coordinate $r$ is the distance from the origin, given by $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.\n$$r = \\sqrt{0^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{36} = 6$$\nThe angle $\\theta$ is the angle with the positive polar axis.

Let's use $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.

Therefore, the form $r = a(1 + \\sin\\theta)$ is not the correct one.\n\nCase 2: Using the '-' sign.\n$$6 = a(1 - (-1)) = a(1 + 1) = 2a$$\nSolving for $a$, we find:\n$$a = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$$\nThis gives a valid solution for the parameter $a$.\n\nThus, the correct form of the equation is $r = a(1 - \\sin\\theta)$ with $a=3$. The specific equation is $r = 3(1 - \\sin\\theta)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the expression for $f(\\theta)$, which is the right-hand side of this equation.\nTherefore, $f(\\theta) = 3(1 - \\sin\\theta)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3(1 - \\sin(\\theta))}$$", "id": "2134338"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the previous exercise, we now turn to the more general limaçon, which can exhibit a greater variety of shapes.
