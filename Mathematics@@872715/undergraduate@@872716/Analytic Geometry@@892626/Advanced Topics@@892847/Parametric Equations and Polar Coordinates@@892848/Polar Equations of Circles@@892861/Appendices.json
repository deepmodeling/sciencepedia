The common chord is the straight line segment connecting their two points of intersection.\n\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of the intersection points. A point of intersection $(r, \\theta)$ must satisfy both equations.\n\nOne possible point of intersection is the pole (the origin), where $r=0$. Let's verify if the pole lies on both circles.\nFor the first circle, $r = a \\cos(\\theta)$, if we set $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, then $r = a \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = a \\cdot 0 = 0$.
