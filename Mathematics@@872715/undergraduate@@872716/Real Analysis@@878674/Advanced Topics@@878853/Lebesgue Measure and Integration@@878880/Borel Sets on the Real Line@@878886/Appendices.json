An $F_{\\sigma}$ set is a countable union of closed sets. We need to check if $A$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ are $F_{\\sigma}$ sets.\n\nThe set $A$ is defined as $A = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} [n, n + 2^{-n}]$. Each interval $[n, n + 2^{-n}]$ is a closed interval, and therefore a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$. The set $A$ is a union of a countable collection of these closed sets (indexed by the natural numbers $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$). By definition, $A$ is an $F_{\\sigma}$ set.\n\nThe set $B = \\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of rational numbers. The set $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable. We can express $\\mathbb{Q}$ as the union of all its singleton elements: $\\mathbb{Q} = \\bigcup_{q \\in \\mathbb{Q}} \\{q\\}$. In the standard topology of $\\mathbb{R}$, any singleton set $\\{q\\}$ is a closed set. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a countable set, this is a countable union of closed sets. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}$ is an $F_{\\sigma}$ set.\n\nNow we consider the set $C = A \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$. A fundamental property of $F_{\\sigma}$ sets is that the intersection of two $F_{\\sigma}$ sets is also an $F_{\\sigma}$ set. To see this, let $X = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} X_i$ and $Y = \\bigcup_{j=1}^{\\infty} Y_j$ be two $F_{\\sigma}$ sets, where each $X_i$ and $Y_j$ is a closed set. Their intersection is given by:\n$$X \\cap Y = \\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} X_i\\right) \\cap \\left(\\bigcup_{j=1}^{\\infty} Y_j\\right) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\bigcup_{j=1}^{\\infty} (X_i \\cap Y_j)$$\nThe intersection of two closed sets, $X_i \\cap Y_j$, is a closed set. The set of all pairs $(i, j)$ where $i, j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is a countable set (since $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ is countable). Thus, $X \\cap Y$ is a countable union of closed sets, making it an $F_{\\sigma}$ set.\nSince both $A$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ are $F_{\\sigma}$ sets, their intersection $C = A \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ must be an $F_{\\sigma}$ set. This immediately shows that statement E is incorrect.\n\nNext, let's evaluate the other options.\n\nStatement D claims $C$ is a finite set. The set $C$ is the set of all rational numbers that fall into any of the intervals $[n, n + 2^{-n}]$. For any integer $n \\ge 1$, the interval $[n, n + 2^{-n}]$ has a positive length of $2^{-n}$. By the density of rational numbers in $\\mathbb{R}$, any non-empty interval contains infinitely many rational numbers. Thus, for each $n$, the set $[n, n + 2^{-n}] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ is an infinite set. The set $C$ is the union of all these infinite sets, so $C$ is an infinite set. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.\n\nStatement A claims $C$ is an open set. A set is open if it contains an open neighborhood around each of its points. Let's pick any point $q \\in C$. Since $q \\in C$, $q$ must be a rational number. By the density of irrational numbers, any open interval $(q-\\epsilon, q+\\epsilon)$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$ will contain irrational numbers. These irrational numbers are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$, and therefore not in $C$. This means no open neighborhood of $q$ is entirely contained within $C$. Thus, $C$ contains no interior points, so it cannot be an open set. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.\n\nStatement B claims $C$ is a closed set. A set is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points. Let's try to find a limit point of $C$ that is not in $C$. Consider the first interval in the definition of $A$, which is $[1, 1 + 1/2]$. This interval contains irrational numbers. For example, the number $x = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ is irrational. Since $1  \\sqrt{2}  2$, we have $1/4  \\sqrt{2}/4  2/4 = 1/2$, so $1+1/4  x  1+1/2$. This shows $x \\in (1, 1+1/2) \\subset [1, 1.5]$.\nSince $x$ is a real number, we can find a sequence of rational numbers $\\{q_k\\}$ that converges to $x$. For instance, we can take the sequence of decimal truncations of $x$. As $q_k \\to x$, for $k$ large enough, $q_k$ will lie in the same interval $(1, 1+1/2)$ as $x$. This means for $k$ large enough, $q_k \\in [1, 1.5]$ and $q_k \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, so $q_k \\in C$.\nWe have found a sequence $\\{q_k\\}$ of points in $C$ that converges to the point $x = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$. By definition, $x$ is a limit point of $C$. However, $x$ is an irrational number, so $x \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$, which implies $x \\notin C$. Since $C$ does not contain all of its limit points, $C$ is not a closed set. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.\n\nHaving eliminated A, B, D, and E, we are left with statement C. We have already shown that $C$ is an $F_{\\sigma}$ set and that it is not a closed set. Thus, statement C is the correct description of the set $C$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1284238"}, {"introduction": "To truly master Borel sets, we must understand the rules they follow.

Indeed, the set of polynomials with rational coefficients is countable, and each such polynomial has finitely many real roots, so the union of all roots is a countable union of finite sets and hence countable. Every singleton $\\{a\\}$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$, so a countable set $A$ can be written as $A=\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\{a_{n}\\}$, a countable union of closed sets. Therefore $A$ is a Borel set. Hence A is Borel.\n\nAnalysis of option B: The set of irrationals is $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, it is Borel by the same reasoning as in A, and $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$ is closed under complementation. Therefore $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ is Borel. Hence B is Borel.\n\nAnalysis of option C: The Cantor set $C$ is closed, hence Borel. For each $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the translate $C+n=\\{c+n: c \\in C\\}$ is the image of $C$ under the homeomorphism $x \\mapsto x+n$, so $C+n$ is closed and thus Borel.

If $V+\\pi=T(V)$ were Borel, then applying $T^{-1}$, we would have $V=T^{-1}(V+\\pi)$ Borel as the preimage of a Borel set under a homeomorphism, which contradicts the non-Borel nature of $V$.
