We will follow a standard constructive proof of Lusin's theorem for this specific case and then analyze the properties of the resulting set $K$.\n\nFirst, let's construct the set $K$.\nThe set of rational numbers in $[0,1]$, denoted $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]$, is countable. Let us enumerate these rational numbers as a sequence $\\{q_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$.\nThe Lebesgue measure of any countable set is zero, so $m(\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]) = 0$.\nOur goal is to remove a small open set from $[0,1]$ that contains all these rational numbers. Let a value for $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$ be given.\nFor each rational number $q_n$ in our enumeration, we can define an open interval $I_n$ centered at $q_n$. Let $I_n = (q_n - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2^{n+1}}, q_n + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2^{n+1}})$. The length of this interval is $m(I_n) = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2^n}$.\nNow, define an open set $U$ as the union of all these intervals: $U = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n$. By construction, $U$ is an open set and it contains every rational number in $[0,1]$ (i.e., $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1] \\subset U$).\n\nWe now define our set $K$ as the part of $[0,1]$ that remains after removing $U$: $K = [0,1] \\setminus U$.\n\nNext, we verify that this set $K$ satisfies the conditions given by Lusin's theorem.\n1.  **Compactness:** The set $U$ is a union of open sets, so it is an open set. The set $[0,1]$ is a closed set. Therefore, $K = [0,1] \\setminus U = [0,1] \\cap (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus U)$ is the intersection of two closed sets, which is itself a closed set. Since $K$ is a subset of $[0,1]$, it is also bounded. In $\\mathbb{R}$, a closed and bounded set is compact. Thus, $K$ is compact.\n\n2.  **Measure of the complement:** The complement of $K$ in $[0,1]$ is $[0,1] \\setminus K = [0,1] \\cap U$. The measure of this set can be bounded using the subadditivity property of the Lebesgue measure:\n    $$m([0,1] \\setminus K) = m([0,1] \\cap U) \\le m(U) = m\\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n\\right) \\le \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} m(I_n)$$\n    Substituting the lengths of the intervals $I_n$:\n    $$m([0,1] \\setminus K) \\le \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon}{2^n} = \\epsilon \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = \\epsilon \\cdot 1 = \\epsilon$$\n    We can make the inequality strict by choosing the length of $I_n$ to be, for example, $\\epsilon/2^{n+1}$. Then the sum is $\\epsilon/2$. In any case, we have constructed $K$ such that $m([0,1]\\setminus K)  \\epsilon$.\n\n3.  **Continuity of the restriction $f|_K$:** By our construction, the open set $U$ contains all rational numbers in $[0,1]$. This means the set $K = [0,1] \\setminus U$ contains no rational numbers. Every element of $K$ must be an irrational number.\n    The function $f(x)=\\chi_{\\mathbb{Q}}(x)$ is defined to be 0 for all irrational numbers. Therefore, for any $x \\in K$, we have $f(x) = 0$. The restriction $f|_K$ is the constant function that maps every element of $K$ to 0. A constant function is everywhere continuous on its domain. Thus, $f|_K$ is continuous.\n\nNow that we have constructed a valid set $K$, we check statements (I) and (II).\n\n**Analysis of Statement (I): $K$ must be a subset of the irrational numbers.**\nAs shown in step 3 of our verification, the set $K$ we constructed consists exclusively of irrational numbers. This is because we deliberately removed an open set $U$ that contained all the rationals in $[0,1]$. Therefore, statement (I) is true for our constructed set $K$.\n\n**Analysis of Statement (II): $K$ must have an empty interior.**\nThe interior of a set is the largest open set contained within it. An equivalent definition states that a point $x$ is in the interior of $K$ if there exists some $\\delta  0$ such that the open interval $(x-\\delta, x+\\delta)$ is entirely contained in $K$.\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the interior of $K$ is non-empty. This would mean that $K$ contains at least one open interval, say $(a,b)$ with $ab$.\nHowever, a fundamental property of the real number system is that any non-empty open interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many rational numbers.\nThis leads to a contradiction. Our constructed set $K$ contains only irrational numbers (as established in the analysis of statement I), so it cannot contain the interval $(a,b)$, which is guaranteed to have rational numbers.\nTherefore, our assumption must be false. The interior of $K$ must be empty. So, statement (II) is also true for our constructed set $K$.\n\nSince both statements (I) and (II) must be true for our valid construction of $K$, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1309703"}, {"introduction": "Lusin's theorem is not just a theoretical curiosity; it is a powerful tool for extending results about continuous functions to the broader class of measurable functions.

The statement \"$f$ is continuous on $K_f$\" means that the function $f|_{K_f}: K_f \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function. Similarly, $g|_{K_g}: K_g \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function. We want to determine where the sum $h = f+g$ is continuous.\n\nA fundamental property of continuous functions states that if two functions, say $\\phi_1: D \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\phi_2: D \\to \\mathbb{R}$, are both continuous on a common domain $D$, then their sum $\\phi_1 + \\phi_2$ is also continuous on $D$.\n\nTo apply this principle to $f$ and $g$, we need to find a common domain on which both functions are known to be continuous. From the problem statement, we know $f$ is continuous on $K_f$ and $g$ is continuous on $K_g$. Therefore, both functions are simultaneously known to be continuous on the intersection of these two sets, $K_f \\cap K_g$.\n\nLet's consider the restrictions of $f$ and $g$ to the set $K_f \\cap K_g$.\nThe set $K_f \\cap K_g$ is a subset of $K_f$. Since $f|_{K_f}$ is continuous, its restriction to any subset of $K_f$ is also continuous. Thus, the function $f|_{K_f \\cap K_g}$ is continuous.\nSimilarly, $K_f \\cap K_g$ is a subset of $K_g$. Since $g|_{K_g}$ is continuous, its restriction to any subset of $K_g$ is also continuous. Thus, the function $g|_{K_f \\cap K_g}$ is continuous.\n\nNow we have two functions, $f|_{K_f \\cap K_g}$ and $g|_{K_f \\cap K_g}$, that are both continuous on the common domain $D = K_f \\cap K_g$. According to the property of sums of continuous functions, their sum, $(f+g)|_{K_f \\cap K_g}$, must also be continuous. This means that $h = f+g$ is guaranteed to be continuous when restricted to the set $K_f \\cap K_g$.\n\nLet's examine why other options are not correct.\n\nA. $K_f \\cup K_g$: Consider a point $x \\in (K_f \\cup K_g) \\setminus (K_f \\cap K_g)$. This point is in either $K_f \\setminus K_g$ or $K_g \\setminus K_f$. If $x \\in K_f \\setminus K_g$, we know $f$ is continuous at $x$ (with respect to the domain $K_f$), but we have no information about the continuity of $g$ at $x$, since $x$ is not in $K_g$. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the continuity of the sum $f+g$ at $x$. A symmetric argument applies if $x \\in K_g \\setminus K_f$.\n\nC. $K_f \\setminus K_g$: For any point $x$ in this set, we know $f$ is continuous, but we have no guarantee about the continuity of $g$. Thus, the sum is not guaranteed to be continuous on this set.\n\nD. $[0, 1] \\setminus (K_f \\cap K_g)$: This set contains all points not in the intersection. This includes points where neither function is known to be continuous, and points where only one of them is known to be continuous. There is no guarantee of continuity for the sum here.\n\nE. The empty set $\\emptyset$: This is technically true, as any function is continuous on the empty set, but we have found a potentially non-empty set, $K_f \\cap K_g$, on which continuity is guaranteed. Since $K_f$ and $K_g$ are subsets of $[0,1]$ with complements of small measure, their intersection is generally non-empty.
