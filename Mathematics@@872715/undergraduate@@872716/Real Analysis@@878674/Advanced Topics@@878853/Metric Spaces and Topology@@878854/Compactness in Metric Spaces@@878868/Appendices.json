We will analyze each option. The set $S$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual metric.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{C} = \\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha \\in A}$ be an arbitrary open cover of $S$. This means $S \\subseteq \\bigcup_{\\alpha \\in A} U_\\alpha$.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n\"Every open set $U_\\alpha$ in the cover $\\mathcal{C}$ must contain at least two distinct points from the set $S$.\"\n\nThis statement is false. We can construct a counterexample. Consider the point $1 \\in S$. Let's define an open set $U_1 = (0.9, 1.1)$. This set contains the point $1$. The next largest point in $S$ is $1/2 = 0.5$, and all other points $1/n$ for $n \\ge 2$ are less than or equal to $0.5$. The point $0$ is also outside this interval. Therefore, $U_1 \\cap S = \\{1\\}$. We can construct an open cover containing such a set. For instance, $\\mathcal{C} = \\{ (0.9, 1.1), (-0.1, 0.6) \\}$. This is a valid open cover for $S$ (since any $1/n$ for $n \\ge 2$ is in $(-0.1, 0.6)$, as is $0$), but the open set $(0.9, 1.1)$ contains only one point from $S$. Thus, A is not necessarily true.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n\"There must exist at least one open set $U_\\alpha$ in the cover $\\mathcal{C}$ that contains an infinite number of points from the set $S$.\"\n\nThis statement is true. Here is the reasoning:\nThe point $0$ is an element of $S$. Since $\\mathcal{C}$ is an open cover of $S$, there must be some open set in the cover, let's call it $U_0$, such that $0 \\in U_0$.\nBy the definition of an open set in $\\mathbb{R}$, the fact that $0 \\in U_0$ implies there exists a real number $\\epsilon > 0$ such that the open interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ is a subset of $U_0$.\nNow consider the sequence of points $\\{1/n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ in $S$. This sequence converges to $0$. By the definition of convergence, for the $\\epsilon > 0$ we just found, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that for all integers $n \\ge N$, we have $|1/n - 0|  \\epsilon$.\nThis inequality simplifies to $1/n  \\epsilon$ (since $n$ is positive). This means all points in the infinite set $\\{1/N, 1/(N+1), 1/(N+2), \\dots\\}$ are contained within the interval $(0, \\epsilon)$, which is a subset of $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$.\nSince $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\subseteq U_0$, the set $U_0$ must contain the infinite set of points $\\{1/N, 1/(N+1), 1/(N+2), \\dots\\}$ from $S$.\nTherefore, for any open cover $\\mathcal{C}$ of $S$, the open set containing $0$ must necessarily contain infinitely many points of $S$. So, statement B is true.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\n\"The cover $\\mathcal{C}$ must consist of an infinite number of distinct open sets.\"\n\nThis statement is false. Consider the single open set $U = (-1, 2)$. Every point in $S$ is in this interval, since $0  1/n \\le 1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. Thus, $\\mathcal{C} = \\{(-1, 2)\\}$ is a valid open cover for $S$. This cover consists of only one set, which is not an infinite number. Thus, C is not necessarily true.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\n\"Any finite subcollection of $\\mathcal{C}$ that covers the point $0$ must also cover the entire set $S$.\"\n\nThis statement is false. We can construct a counterexample. Let our open cover be $\\mathcal{C} = \\{U_1, U_2\\}$, where $U_1 = (-0.5, 0.5)$ and $U_2 = (0.4, 1.1)$.\nThis collection covers $S$:\n- $0 \\in U_1$.\n- For $n=1$, $1/1=1 \\in U_2$.\n- For $n=2$, $1/2=0.5$, which is not in $U_1$ or $U_2$. We need to adjust our cover. Let's try $\\mathcal{C} = \\{U_1, U_2\\}$ with $U_1 = (-0.5, 0.6)$ and $U_2 = (0.4, 1.1)$.\n- $0 \\in U_1$. For $n \\ge 2$, $1/n \\le 0.5$, so $\\{0, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots\\} \\subset U_1$.\n- For $n=1$, $1/1=1 \\in U_2$.\nSo, $\\mathcal{C} = \\{(-0.5, 0.6), (0.4, 1.1)\\}$ is an open cover for $S$.\nNow consider the finite subcollection $\\{U_1\\} = \\{(-0.5, 0.6)\\}$. This subcollection covers the point $0$. However, it does not cover the entire set $S$, because the point $1 \\in S$ is not in $U_1$. Thus, D is not necessarily true.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\n\"Any finite subcover of $S$ extracted from $\\mathcal{C}$ must include all of the open sets from $\\mathcal{C}$ that contain the point $0$.\"\n\nThis statement is false. Let's construct a counterexample. Let the open cover be $\\mathcal{C} = \\{U_1, U_2\\}$, where $U_1 = (-1, 2)$ and $U_2 = (-0.1, 0.1)$.\nBoth $U_1$ and $U_2$ contain the point $0$.\nThe collection $\\mathcal{F} = \\{U_1\\}$ is a finite subcollection of $\\mathcal{C}$. Since $S \\subset U_1$, $\\mathcal{F}$ is a finite subcover of $S$.\nHowever, this subcover $\\mathcal{F}$ does not include the set $U_2 = (-0.1, 0.1)$, which is a set from the original cover $\\mathcal{C}$ that contains the point $0$.
