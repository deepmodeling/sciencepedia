Now we consider the corresponding sequence $\\{m_k\\}$.\nSubcase B1: The sequence $\\{m_k\\}$ is bounded. Since $\\{m_k\\}$ consists of natural numbers, it must take on at least one value $m_0$ infinitely often. By passing to a further subsequence, we can assume $m_k = m_0$ for all $k$, while we still have $n_k \\to \\infty$. Then $s_k = \\frac{n_k}{n_k+1} + \\frac{1}{m_0}$. The limit is $x = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} s_k = 1 + \\frac{1}{m_0}$. Thus, $x \\in L_2$.\nSubcase B2: The sequence $\\{m_k\\}$ is unbounded. We can pass to a further subsequence where $m_k$ is strictly increasing, so $m_k \\to \\infty$. In this subsequence, we have both $n_k \\to \\infty$ and $m_k \\to \\infty$. Then $s_k = \\frac{n_k}{n_k+1} + \\frac{1}{m_k}$. The limit is $x = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} s_k = 1 + 0 = 1$. Thus, $x=1$.\n\nIn all possible cases, any limit point $x$ of $S$ must be an element of $L_1$, $L_2$, or be equal to $1$.

The correct approach is to test a potential counterexample. Consider the sequence $(x_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ in $\\mathbb{N}$ where $x_n = n$.\n\nFirst, we must verify if this sequence is a Cauchy sequence in the metric space $(\\mathbb{N}, d)$.

The sequence $x_n=n$ is Cauchy but not eventually constant.\n- B is irrelevant. The completeness of a set depends on the metric. Properties under the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}$ do not automatically transfer to this new, different metric $d$ on $\\mathbb{N}$.\n- D claims the sequence $x_n = n^2$ converges to a limit outside $\\mathbb{N}$. Let's test if it is a Cauchy sequence. $d(m^2, n^2) = |\\frac{1}{m^2} - \\frac{1}{n^2}|$. By similar logic as above, this is also a Cauchy sequence. It also does not converge in $(\\mathbb{N}, d)$ as its \"limit point\" would also correspond to 0. So while the sequence is also a valid counterexample, the statement that it \"converges to a limit outside of $\\mathbb{N}$\" is sloppy. A sequence in a space X either converges to a point in X or it diverges in X. It cannot \"converge to a point outside of X\" in the context of the space X itself.
