Consider the standard Cantor-Lebesgue function, denoted by $C(x)$, defined on the interval $[0,1]$. This function is known to possess several key properties: it is continuous and non-decreasing with $C(0) = 0$ and $C(1) = 1$. Furthermore, its derivative $C'(x)$ exists and is equal to zero for almost every $x$ in $[0,1]$.\n\nNow, let us define a new function, $h(x)$, on the same interval $[0,1]$ by taking the maximum of the Cantor-Lebesgue function and a simple quadratic:\n$$h(x) = \\max(x^2, C(x))$$\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the function $h(x)$ on the interval $[0,1]$?\n\nA. $h(x)$ is absolutely continuous.\n\nB. $h(x)$ is not continuous.\n\nC. $h(x)$ is not of bounded variation.\n\nD. $h(x)$ is of bounded variation but not absolutely continuous.\n\nE. $h(x)$ is differentiable everywhere on the open interval $(0,1)$.", "solution": "We recall that the Cantor-Lebesgue function $C(x)$ on $[0,1]$ is continuous, non-decreasing, satisfies $C(0)=0$, $C(1)=1$, has $C'(x)=0$ for almost every $x$, is of bounded variation (indeed, monotone), and is not absolutely continuous (it is singular).\n\nDefine $h(x)=\\max\\{x^{2},C(x)\\}$ on $[0,1]$.\n\nFirst, since the maximum of two continuous functions is continuous, $h$ is continuous. Also, since $x^{2}$ is non-decreasing on $[0,1]$ and $C$ is non-decreasing, the pointwise maximum of two non-decreasing functions is non-decreasing. Therefore $h$ is non-decreasing. Every non-decreasing function on a compact interval is of bounded variation, and its total variation equals $h(1)-h(0)=1-0=1$. Hence $h$ is of bounded variation, so option C is false and option B is false.\n\nNext, we show $h$ is not absolutely continuous.
