Let $x \\in (0,1)$ and let $\\epsilon0$. Since $x \\in (0,1)$, there exists $\\delta0$ such that $(x-\\delta,x+\\delta) \\subset (0,1)$. Taking $\\eta=\\min\\{\\epsilon,\\delta\\}$ ensures $(x-\\eta,x+\\eta) \\subset (0,1)$. By the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, for any $ab$ there exists $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $aqb$. Applying this with $a=x-\\eta$ and $b=x+\\eta$ yields a rational $q$ with $x-\\etaqx+\\eta$. Because $(x-\\eta,x+\\eta)\\subset (0,1)$, this $q$ satisfies $0q1$, hence $q \\in S$, and also $|q-x|\\epsilon$. Therefore, every neighborhood of $x$ meets $S$, so $x \\in \\bar{S}$. This proves $(0,1) \\subset \\bar{S}$.\n\nNext, we show that $0 \\in \\bar{S}$ and $1 \\in \\bar{S}$. Let $\\epsilon0$. By the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $0q\\epsilon$. Then $q \\in S$ and $|q-0|\\epsilon$, so every neighborhood of $0$ meets $S$, implying $0 \\in \\bar{S}$. Similarly, there exists $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $1-\\epsilonq1$, so $q \\in S$ and $|q-1|\\epsilon$, hence $1 \\in \\bar{S}$. Therefore $[0,1] \\subset \\bar{S}$.\n\nFinally, we show that no point outside $[0,1]$ lies in $\\bar{S}$. If $x0$, set $\\epsilon=\\frac{1}{2}|x-0|$.
