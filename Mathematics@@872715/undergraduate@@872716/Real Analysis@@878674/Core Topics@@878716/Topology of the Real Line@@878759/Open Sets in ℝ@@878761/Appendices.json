The set $D$ is not open because for any point $x \\in D$ close to $0$, any open interval $(x-\\epsilon, x+\\epsilon)$ will contain the point $0$ if $\\epsilon$ is chosen to be large enough, and $0 \\notin D$.\nB.

The set $D$ is open. For any $x \\in D$, we can choose $\\epsilon = \\frac{|x|}{2}$.

The definition of an open set requires that for *any* choice of $\\epsilon > 0$, the interval $(x-\\epsilon,x+\\epsilon)$ must be contained in $D$.
