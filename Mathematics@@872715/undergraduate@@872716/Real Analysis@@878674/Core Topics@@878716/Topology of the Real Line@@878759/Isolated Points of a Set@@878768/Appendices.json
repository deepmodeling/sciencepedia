Thus, every point of the form $\\frac{1}{n}$ is an isolated point. Since there are infinitely many such points, this set has infinitely many isolated points.\n- The point $0$ is a limit point of the set, not an isolated point. Any open interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ around $0$ contains points of the form $\\frac{1}{n}$ for sufficiently large $n$ (specifically, for any $n  1/\\epsilon$).\nSince $S_A$ has infinitely many isolated points, it is not the correct answer.\n\n**B. $S_B = \\mathbb{Q}$**\nThe set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is infinite. Let's check for isolated points.\nThe set of rational numbers is dense in the real numbers. This means that for any rational number $q$ and any $\\epsilon  0$, the open interval $(q - \\epsilon, q + \\epsilon)$ contains infinitely many other rational numbers. Therefore, it's impossible to find an $\\epsilon  0$ such that $(q - \\epsilon, q + \\epsilon) \\cap \\mathbb{Q} = \\{q\\}$. This means that no point in $\\mathbb{Q}$ is an isolated point. The set has zero isolated points. This is not the correct answer.\n\n**C. $S_C = [0, 1] \\cup \\{2, 3\\}$**\nThis set is infinite because it contains the interval $[0, 1]$.\n- Consider any point $s_0 \\in [0, 1]$. For any $\\epsilon  0$, the interval $(s_0 - \\epsilon, s_0 + \\epsilon)$ will always contain other points from the interval $[0, 1]$. For instance, $(s_0 - \\epsilon, s_0 + \\epsilon) \\cap [0, 1]$ is itself an interval (or a half-open interval if $s_0=0$ or $s_0=1$) containing infinitely many points. So, no point in $[0, 1]$ is isolated.\n- Consider the point $s_0 = 2$. We need to find an $\\epsilon  0$ such that $(2-\\epsilon, 2+\\epsilon) \\cap S_C = \\{2\\}$. The closest other points in $S_C$ are $1$ and $3$. The distance to $1$ is $1$, and the distance to $3$ is $1$. If we choose, for example, $\\epsilon = 0.5$, the interval is $(1.5, 2.5)$. The intersection of $(1.5, 2.5)$ with $S_C = [0, 1] \\cup \\{2, 3\\}$ is exactly $\\{2\\}$. So, $2$ is an isolated point.\n- Consider the point $s_0 = 3$. Similarly, we can choose $\\epsilon = 0.5$. The interval is $(2.5, 3.5)$. The intersection of $(2.5, 3.5)$ with $S_C$ is exactly $\\{3\\}$. So, $3$ is also an isolated point.\nThis set has two isolated points. This is not the correct answer.\n\n**D. $S_D = \\{ n + \\frac{1}{m} \\mid n \\in \\{0, 1\\}, m \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$**\nThis set is the union of two sequences: $A_0 = \\{\\frac{1}{m} \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} = \\{1, 1/2, 1/3, ...\\}$ and $A_1 = \\{1 + \\frac{1}{m} \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} = \\{2, 3/2, 4/3, ...\\}$. The set $S_D$ is infinite.\nThe sequence $A_0$ is contained in the interval $(0, 1]$ and accumulates at 0. The sequence $A_1$ is in $(1, 2]$ and accumulates at 1. Note that the limit points 0 and 1 are not in $S_D$.\nEvery point in $A_0$ is separated from other points in $A_0$ by a finite distance. The distance from any point in $A_0$ to any point in $A_1$ is also bounded below by a positive number. Specifically, for any $s \\in S_D$, we can find an $\\epsilon  0$ that isolates it. For example, take $s_0 = 1 + \\frac{1}{m}$. The nearest points in its own sequence are $1+\\frac{1}{m-1}$ and $1+\\frac{1}{m+1}$. The nearest points in the other sequence are in $(0, 1]$. The distance is $\\left| (1 + \\frac{1}{m}) - \\frac{1}{k} \\right|  0$ for any $k \\ge 1$. Therefore, we can always find a small enough neighborhood containing only $s_0$. Every point in $S_D$ is an isolated point. The set has infinitely many isolated points. This is not the correct answer.\n\n**E. $S_E = \\{ \\sin(x) \\mid x \\in [0, \\pi/2] \\} \\cup \\{2 \\}$**\nFirst, let's identify the set $A = \\{ \\sin(x) \\mid x \\in [0, \\pi/2] \\}$. The function $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ is continuous and monotonically increasing on the closed interval $[0, \\pi/2]$. Therefore, its image is the closed interval $[\\sin(0), \\sin(\\pi/2)] = [0, 1]$.\nSo, the set is $S_E = [0, 1] \\cup \\{2\\}$.\nThis set is infinite because it contains the interval $[0, 1]$.\n- As established in the analysis of option C, no point in the interval $[0, 1]$ is an isolated point of $S_E$. Any neighborhood of a point in $[0, 1]$ contains other points from $[0, 1]$.\n- Consider the point $s_0 = 2$. The closest point in $S_E$ is $1$. The distance is $2 - 1 = 1$. If we choose $\\epsilon = 0.5$, the open interval $(2 - 0.5, 2 + 0.5) = (1.5, 2.5)$. The intersection of this interval with $S_E = [0, 1] \\cup \\{2\\}$ is just $\\{2\\}$. Therefore, $2$ is an isolated point.\nThe set $S_E$ is infinite and has exactly one isolated point. This is the correct answer.\n\nFinal check:\n- A: Infinite isolated points.\n- B: Zero isolated points.\n- C: Two isolated points.\n- D: Infinite isolated points.\n- E: One isolated point.\n\nThus, the correct option is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1306187"}]}
