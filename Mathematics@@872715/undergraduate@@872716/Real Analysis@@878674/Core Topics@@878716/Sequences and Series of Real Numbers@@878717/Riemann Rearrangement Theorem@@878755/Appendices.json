This series is conditionally convergent, meaning the series itself converges, but the series of its absolute values diverges. The Riemann rearrangement theorem states that the terms of such a series can be rearranged to sum to any real number.\n\nConsider the following algorithm that rearranges the terms of the alternating harmonic series to make it converge to the value 1.\nLet $P = (1, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\dots)$ be the sequence of positive terms and $N = (-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{4}, -\\frac{1}{6}, \\dots)$ be the sequence of negative terms. A new series is constructed by adding terms from these sequences according to the rules below:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Start with a sum of 0.\n2.  **Positive Step**: Add terms from the beginning of sequence $P$ one-by-one until the total sum first becomes greater than 1.\n3.  **Negative Step**: Add terms from the beginning of sequence $N$ one-by-one until the total sum first becomes less than 1.\n4.  **Repeat**: Continue alternating between the Positive Step (using the next available terms in $P$) and the Negative Step (using the next available terms in $N$) indefinitely.\n\nThis process generates a rearranged series that converges to 1. How must this algorithm be modified so that the resulting rearranged series converges to the value 2?\n\nA. In both the Positive and Negative steps, replace the threshold value of 1 with 2.\n\nB.

Let's analyze the given algorithm and the proposed modifications.\n\nThe original algorithm causes the sequence of partial sums, let's call it $\\{S_k\\}$, to converge to 1. The mechanism works as follows:\n1.  The 'Positive Step' adds positive terms until the partial sum $S_k$ just exceeds the target value, $T=1$.\n2.  The 'Negative Step' then adds negative terms until the partial sum $S_k$ just drops below the target value, $T=1$.\n\nThis process is repeated. The series of positive terms ($1 + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\dots$) and the series of negative terms ($-\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{6} - \\dots$) both diverge on their own. This divergence guarantees that we can always find enough terms to cross any given threshold.\n\nThe convergence of the rearranged series to the target $T$ is guaranteed because the individual terms of the original series, $\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}$, approach 0 as $n \\to \\infty$. This means that the amount by which the partial sums \"overshoot\" or \"undershoot\" the target value $T$ gets smaller and smaller with each step. For any small value $\\epsilon  0$, eventually the terms being added are all smaller than $\\epsilon$. From that point on, the partial sums $S_k$ will always remain within the interval $(T-\\epsilon, T+\\epsilon)$. By definition, this means the sequence of partial sums converges to $T$.\n\nThe question asks how to modify this algorithm to make the series converge to 2 instead of 1. The logic of the algorithm is entirely dependent on the target value used as the threshold for switching between adding positive and negative terms. To change the convergence value, we must change this target threshold.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n**A. In both the Positive and Negative steps, replace the threshold value of 1 with 2.**\nThis modification changes the target value to $T=2$. The Positive Step will now add terms from $P$ until the sum exceeds 2. The Negative Step will add terms from $N$ until the sum drops below 2. Since the individual terms still approach 0, the overshoots and undershoots will diminish, and the partial sums will converge to 2. This is the correct modification of the given algorithm's logic.\n\n**B. In the Positive Step, take exactly twice the number of terms as were taken in the previous Positive Step, while keeping the Negative Step unchanged.**\nThis describes a different kind of rearrangement algorithm, one not based on a threshold value. It is not a modification of the *given* algorithm. Furthermore, such a rule would likely lead to divergence, as the number of positive terms added would grow exponentially.\n\n**C. In the Positive Step, use a threshold of 2, but in the Negative Step, continue to use the threshold of 1.**\nWith this modification, the partial sums would be forced to go above 2, and then would be brought back down to below 1. The partial sums would perpetually oscillate between values just below 1 and just above 2. The amplitude of these oscillations would not decrease to zero, so the series would not converge.\n\n**D. Before starting the algorithm, multiply every term in both sequences $P$ and $N$ by 2.**\nThis action does not produce a rearrangement of the original alternating harmonic series. It creates a new series, $2 \\sum \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}$, whose terms are different. While this new series would converge to $2 \\ln(2)$, it is not a rearrangement.\n\n**E. At each stage, take one term from sequence $P$, and then take a sufficient number of terms from sequence $N$ to bring the sum below the original term from $P$.**\nThis is another description of a different algorithm, not a modification of the one provided. It's unclear what this would converge to, if anything, without more precise rules. It does not follow the threshold-based logic of the problem's algorithm.\n\nTherefore, the only correct way to adapt the given threshold-based algorithm to converge to a new value is to change the threshold itself to that new value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1320931"}, {"introduction": "Having understood the general principle of targeting a new sum, we can now apply these ideas to a specific, systematic rearrangement.

This series is known to be conditionally convergent, and its sum is denoted by $S$. A new series, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n$, is formed by rearranging the terms of the original series.

For any even integer $k=2m$ where $m \\ge 1$, the terms $a_{2m}$ and $a_{2m+1}$ are swapped. This means that the term at position $2m$ in the new series is $a_{2m+1}$, and the term at position $2m+1$ is $a_{2m}$.

As established earlier, since the series $\\sum a_n$ converges, its terms must approach zero, so $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = 0$. This implies that any subsequence of terms, like $a_{2m+1}$, must also approach zero.
