You are given a series that is known to converge, and your task is to determine the convergence of a new series formed by multiplying the original terms by a seemingly simple factor.

We can express $u_n$ as the product of two sequences, $a_n$ and $b_n$. Let's define:\n$a_n = \\frac{(-1)^n}{n \\ln(n)}$\n$b_n = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\ln n}$\n\nWe are given that the series $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} a_n$ is convergent. We can use Abel's test to determine the convergence of $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} u_n = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} a_n b_n$. Abel's test states that if $\\sum a_n$ is a convergent series and $\\{b_n\\}$ is a monotonic and bounded sequence, then the series $\\sum a_n b_n$ also converges.\n\nWe need to verify that the sequence $\\{b_n\\}_{n=2}^{\\infty}$ is monotonic and bounded.\n\n1.  **Monotonicity of $\\{b_n\\}$**:\n    To check for monotonicity, we can consider the function $f(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\ln x}$ for $x \\ge 2$. The derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is:\n    $$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(1 + (\\ln x)^{-1}\\right) = -1 \\cdot (\\ln x)^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(\\ln x) = -\\frac{1}{x(\\ln x)^2} $$\n    For $x \\ge 2$, both $x$ and $(\\ln x)^2$ are positive. Therefore, $f'(x)  0$ for all $x \\ge 2$. This means the function $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing on the interval $[2, \\infty)$. Consequently, the sequence $b_n = f(n)$ is a strictly decreasing sequence for $n \\ge 2$. A decreasing sequence is monotonic.\n\n2.  **Boundedness of $\\{b_n\\}$**:\n    Since the sequence $\\{b_n\\}$ is decreasing for $n \\ge 2$, it is bounded above by its first term, $b_2 = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\ln 2}$.\n    To find a lower bound, we can evaluate the limit of the sequence as $n \\to \\infty$:\n    $$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} b_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\ln n}\\right) = 1 + 0 = 1 $$\n    Since the sequence is decreasing and approaches 1, it is bounded below by 1. Thus, for all $n \\ge 2$, we have $1  b_n \\le 1 + \\frac{1}{\\ln 2}$. The sequence $\\{b_n\\}$ is bounded.\n\nSince the series $\\sum a_n$ converges (given) and the sequence $\\{b_n\\}$ is both monotonic and bounded, we can conclude by Abel's test that the series $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} u_n = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} a_n b_n$ converges.\n\nNext, we must determine if this convergence is absolute or conditional. To do this, we test the convergence of the series of absolute values, $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} |u_n|$.\n$$ |u_n| = \\left| \\frac{(-1)^n}{n \\ln(n)} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\ln n}\\right) \\right| = \\frac{1}{n \\ln(n)} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\ln n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n \\ln n} + \\frac{1}{n(\\ln n)^2} $$\nThe series of absolute values is $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} |u_n| = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{n \\ln n} + \\frac{1}{n(\\ln n)^2}\\right)$.\nThis is a series of positive terms. We can analyze the convergence of its two component series separately: $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n \\ln n}$ and $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n(\\ln n)^2}$. We use the integral test for both.\n\nFor $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n \\ln n}$:\nThe function $g(x) = \\frac{1}{x \\ln x}$ is continuous, positive, and decreasing for $x \\ge 2$.

We evaluate the improper integral:\n$$ \\int_2^\\infty \\frac{1}{x(\\ln x)^2} \\,dx $$\nUsing the same substitution $v = \\ln x$:\n$$ \\int_{\\ln 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{v^2} \\,dv = \\left[-\\frac{1}{v}\\right]_{\\ln 2}^\\infty = \\lim_{M\\to\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{M}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\ln 2}\\right) = 0 + \\frac{1}{\\ln 2} $$\nSince the integral converges, the series $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n(\\ln n)^2}$ also converges by the integral test.\n\nNow, we consider the series of absolute values again: $\\sum |u_n| = \\sum \\frac{1}{n \\ln n} + \\sum \\frac{1}{n(\\ln n)^2}$.\nThis is the sum of a divergent series and a convergent series. The sum of a divergent series and a convergent series is always divergent.

Then $f_{n}'(x) = n x^{n-1} + 1 > 0$ for all $x > 0$, so $f_{n}$ is strictly increasing on $(0,\\infty)$. Since $f_{n}(0) = -1  0$ and $f_{n}(1) = 1 > 0$, by the intermediate value theorem and strict monotonicity there exists a unique $x_{n} \\in (0,1)$ with $f_{n}(x_{n}) = 0$.\n\nFor $m > n$ and any $x \\in (0,1)$ we have $x^{m}  x^{n}$, hence $f_{m}(x) = x^{m} + x - 1  x^{n} + x - 1 = f_{n}(x)$. Evaluating at $x_{n}$ gives $f_{m}(x_{n})  f_{n}(x_{n}) = 0$. Since $f_{m}$ is strictly increasing with a unique zero $x_{m}$, we must have $x_{m} > x_{n}$. Therefore $(x_{n})$ is increasing and bounded above by $1$, so it has a limit $\\ell \\le 1$.\n\nFrom $x_{n}^{n} + x_{n} - 1 = 0$ we get $1 - x_{n} = x_{n}^{n}$.
