We will find this by successively differentiating the function four times using the product rule. The product rule for differentiation states that for two differentiable functions $u(x)$ and $v(x)$, the derivative of their product is given by $(u(x)v(x))' = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)$.\n\nFor our function $f(x) = x^2 e^x$, we can set $u(x) = x^2$ and $v(x) = e^x$. The derivatives are $u'(x) = 2x$ and $v'(x) = e^x$.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the first derivative, $f'(x)$.**\nUsing the product rule:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 e^x) = (2x)(e^x) + (x^2)(e^x) = (x^2 + 2x)e^x$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the second derivative, $f''(x)$.**\nWe now differentiate $f'(x)$. Let $u(x) = x^2 + 2x$ and $v(x) = e^x$. The derivative of $u(x)$ is $u'(x) = 2x + 2$.\nApplying the product rule again:\n$f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}((x^2 + 2x)e^x) = (2x + 2)e^x + (x^2 + 2x)e^x$.\nCombining the terms, we get:\n$f''(x) = (x^2 + 2x + 2x + 2)e^x = (x^2 + 4x + 2)e^x$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the third derivative, $f'''(x)$.**\nWe differentiate $f''(x)$. Let $u(x) = x^2 + 4x + 2$ and $v(x) = e^x$. The derivative of $u(x)$ is $u'(x) = 2x + 4$.\nApplying the product rule:\n$f'''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}((x^2 + 4x + 2)e^x) = (2x + 4)e^x + (x^2 + 4x + 2)e^x$.\nCombining the terms:\n$f'''(x) = (x^2 + 4x + 2x + 2 + 4)e^x = (x^2 + 6x + 6)e^x$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the fourth derivative, $f^{(4)}(x)$.**\nFinally, we differentiate $f'''(x)$. Let $u(x) = x^2 + 6x + 6$ and $v(x) = e^x$. The derivative of $u(x)$ is $u'(x) = 2x + 6$.\nApplying the product rule for the fourth time:\n$f^{(4)}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}((x^2 + 6x + 6)e^x) = (2x + 6)e^x + (x^2 + 6x + 6)e^x$.\nCombining the terms:\n$f^{(4)}(x) = (x^2 + 6x + 2x + 6 + 6)e^x = (x^2 + 8x + 12)e^x$.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the fourth derivative at $x=0$.**\nNow that we have the expression for the fourth derivative, we substitute $x=0$ into the equation for $f^{(4)}(x)$:\n$f^{(4)}(0) = (0^2 + 8(0) + 12)e^0$.\nSince $e^0 = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$f^{(4)}(0) = (0 + 0 + 12)(1) = 12$.\n\nThus, the value of the fourth derivative of $f(x) = x^2 e^x$ at $x=0$ is 12.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "1302232"}, {"introduction": "Beyond pure calculation, the power of higher-order derivatives lies in what they reveal about a function's behavior.

The equation $f'(x) = k$ has exactly one solution for any constant $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nE. The function $f(x)$ must be an increasing function for all $x  0$.", "solution": "The core information given is that the function $f(x)$ is twice-differentiable and its second derivative is strictly positive, $f''(x)  0$, for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Let's analyze the implications of this condition and evaluate each statement.\n\nThe condition $f''(x)  0$ means that the first derivative, $f'(x)$, is a strictly increasing function. This is a direct consequence of the Mean Value Theorem applied to $f'$. If we take any two points $a  b$, there exists a $c \\in (a,b)$ such that $f'(b) - f'(a) = f''(c)(b-a)$. Since $f''(c)  0$ and $(b-a)  0$, it follows that $f'(b) - f'(a)  0$, so $f'(b)  f'(a)$. Thus, $f'$ is strictly increasing. This property is central to analyzing the options.\n\n**Statement A: The function $f(x)$ must have at least one local minimum.**\nA local minimum can only occur at a critical point, where $f'(x) = 0$. We need to determine if such a point must exist. Consider the function $f(x) = e^x$. Its derivatives are $f'(x) = e^x$ and $f''(x) = e^x$. For all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f''(x)  0$. However, $f'(x) = e^x$ is never zero. Therefore, $f(x) = e^x$ has no critical points and thus no local minima. This serves as a counterexample, so statement A is false.\n\n**Statement B: The function $f(x)$ can have at most one local minimum.**\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $f(x)$ has two distinct local minima at points $x_1$ and $x_2$, with $x_1  x_2$. For a point to be a local minimum of a differentiable function, it must be a critical point. Therefore, we must have $f'(x_1) = 0$ and $f'(x_2) = 0$.\nHowever, we established that $f'(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. This means that for any $x_1  x_2$, we must have $f'(x_1)  f'(x_2)$. The condition $f'(x_1) = f'(x_2) = 0$ contradicts the fact that $f'$ is strictly increasing. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. A function with $f''(x)  0$ cannot have two distinct critical points where the derivative is zero. Thus, it can have at most one point where $f'(x)=0$, and consequently, at most one local minimum. Statement B is necessarily true.\n\n**Statement C: The function $f(x)$ must have a global maximum.**\nA function with $f''(x)0$ is strictly convex. Visually, its graph is a \"cup\" shape that opens upwards. Such a function on the entire real line $\\mathbb{R}$ will be unbounded above. Consider the function $f(x) = x^2$. Its second derivative is $f''(x) = 2  0$. As $x \\to \\infty$ or $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x) \\to \\infty$. This function has no global maximum. Thus, statement C is false.\n\n**Statement D: The equation $f'(x) = k$ has exactly one solution for any constant $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$.**\nWe know that $f'(x)$ is a strictly increasing continuous function. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, $f'(x)$ takes on every value between its infimum and supremum. The range of $f'(x)$ is an open interval $(\\inf_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} f'(x), \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} f'(x))$. For any $k$ within this range, the equation $f'(x) = k$ will have exactly one solution because $f'$ is strictly increasing. However, the range of $f'(x)$ is not necessarily all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\nConsider the counterexample from statement A: $f(x) = e^x$. Here, $f'(x) = e^x$. The range of $f'(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$. If we choose $k=0$ (or any $k \\le 0$), the equation $f'(x) = e^x = k$ has no solution. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true. Statement D is false.\n\n**Statement E: The function $f(x)$ must be an increasing function for all $x  0$.**\nA function is increasing where its derivative is positive or zero. We need to check if $f'(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x  0$. Consider the function $f(x) = (x-5)^2$. Its derivatives are $f'(x) = 2(x-5)$ and $f''(x) = 2  0$. The condition $f''(x)  0$ is satisfied. However, for $x$ in the interval $(0, 5)$, $f'(x) = 2(x-5)$ is negative. For instance, at $x=1$, $f'(1) = -8  0$, which means the function is decreasing at $x=1$. So, $f(x)$ is not necessarily increasing for all $x0$. Statement E is false.\n\nBased on the analysis of all options, only statement B is necessarily true.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1302247"}, {"introduction": "Directly computing a very high-order derivative can be a long and error-prone process.
