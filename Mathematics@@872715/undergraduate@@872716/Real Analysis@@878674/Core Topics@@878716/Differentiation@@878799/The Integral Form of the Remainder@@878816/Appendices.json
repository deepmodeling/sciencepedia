This first exercise [@problem_id:1333521] invites you to calculate the remainder for a cubic polynomial.

This expansion is given by $f(x) = P_n(x) + R_n(x)$, where $P_n(x)$ is the Taylor polynomial of degree $n$ and $R_n(x)$ is the remainder term. The integral form of this remainder is given by the formula:\n$$R_n(x) = \\int_{a}^{x} \\frac{f^{(n+1)}(t)}{n!} (x-t)^n \\,dt$$\n\nConsider the specific polynomial function $p(x) = 5x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 1$.

Express your final answer as a simplified function of $x$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the second-order remainder term, $R_2(x)$, for the polynomial $p(x) = 5x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 1$ centered at $a=1$. We will use the integral form of the remainder.\n\nThe formula for the $n$-th order remainder is given as:\n$$R_n(x) = \\int_{a}^{x} \\frac{p^{(n+1)}(t)}{n!} (x-t)^n \\,dt$$\n\nFor this problem, we have $n=2$ and $a=1$. The formula becomes:\n$$R_2(x) = \\int_{1}^{x} \\frac{p^{(2+1)}(t)}{2!} (x-t)^2 \\,dt = \\int_{1}^{x} \\frac{p^{(3)}(t)}{2} (x-t)^2 \\,dt$$\n\nFirst, we must find the third derivative of the polynomial $p(t) = 5t^3 - 2t^2 + 7t - 1$.\nThe first derivative is:\n$$p'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(5t^3 - 2t^2 + 7t - 1) = 15t^2 - 4t + 7$$\n\nThe second derivative is:\n$$p''(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(15t^2 - 4t + 7) = 30t - 4$$\n\nThe third derivative is:\n$$p^{(3)}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(30t - 4) = 30$$\n\nSince the polynomial is of degree 3, its third derivative is a constant. Now we substitute this result into the integral for $R_2(x)$:\n$$R_2(x) = \\int_{1}^{x} \\frac{30}{2} (x-t)^2 \\,dt = 15 \\int_{1}^{x} (x-t)^2 \\,dt$$\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can use a substitution. Let $u = x-t$. This implies $du = -dt$. We must also change the limits of integration from being in terms of $t$ to being in terms of $u$.\n- When $t=1$ (the lower limit), $u = x-1$.\n- When $t=x$ (the upper limit), $u = x-x = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral, we get:\n$$R_2(x) = 15 \\int_{t=1}^{t=x} (x-t)^2 \\,dt = 15 \\int_{u=x-1}^{u=0} u^2 (-du)$$\n\nWe can use the property $\\int_{b}^{a} f(x) \\,dx = -\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\,dx$ to flip the limits of integration and remove the negative sign:\n$$R_2(x) = 15 \\int_{0}^{x-1} u^2 \\,du$$\n\nNow, we compute the definite integral with respect to $u$:\n$$R_2(x) = 15 \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_0^{x-1}$$\n\nEvaluating the expression at the limits:\n$$R_2(x) = 15 \\left( \\frac{(x-1)^3}{3} - \\frac{0^3}{3} \\right) = 15 \\left( \\frac{(x-1)^3}{3} \\right)$$\n\nSimplifying the expression gives the final result:\n$$R_2(x) = 5(x-1)^3$$\n\nThis result is expected. The Taylor series for a polynomial of degree $m$ centered at $a$ is itself a polynomial of degree $m$. The Taylor polynomial $P_2(x)$ for $p(x)$ at $a=1$ would contain all terms up to degree 2 in $(x-1)$. The remainder $R_2(x)$ must therefore contain the leftover higher-order terms. In this case, since $p(x)$ is a cubic polynomial, the Taylor expansion is $p(x) = p(1) + p'(1)(x-1) + \\frac{p''(1)}{2!}(x-1)^2 + \\frac{p'''(1)}{3!}(x-1)^3$. The first three terms constitute $P_2(x)$, and the last term is the remainder $R_2(x)$. Let's verify this: $R_2(x) = \\frac{p'''(1)}{3!}(x-1)^3 = \\frac{30}{6}(x-1)^3 = 5(x-1)^3$.
