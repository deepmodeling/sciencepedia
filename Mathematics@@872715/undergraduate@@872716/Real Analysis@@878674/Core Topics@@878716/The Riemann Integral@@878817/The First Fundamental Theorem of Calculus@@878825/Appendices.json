Let's define the upper limit as $u(x) = \\sin(x)$ and the integrand as $f(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}}$. The lower limit of integration is a constant, $a = 1/2$. The function $G(x)$ can be written as $G(x) = \\int_a^{u(x)} f(t) \\, dt$.\n\nTo find the derivative $G'(x)$, we apply the Chain Rule:\n$$G'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\int_a^{u(x)} f(t) \\, dt \\right) = f(u(x)) \\cdot u'(x)$$\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the upper limit, $u'(x)$:\n$$u'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin(x)) = \\cos(x)$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the integrand $f(t)$ at the upper limit $u(x) = \\sin(x)$:\n$$f(u(x)) = f(\\sin(x)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\sin(x))^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(x)}}$$\n\nUsing the Pythagorean trigonometric identity, $\\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x) = 1$, we can simplify the denominator:\n$$1 - \\sin^2(x) = \\cos^2(x)$$\nTherefore,\n$$f(\\sin(x)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\cos^2(x)}}$$\n\nIt is crucial to be careful with the square root. The square root of a squared quantity is its absolute value: $\\sqrt{y^2} = |y|$. So, we have:\n$$f(\\sin(x)) = \\frac{1}{|\\cos(x)|}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the domain for $x$ is the interval $(0, \\pi)$.
