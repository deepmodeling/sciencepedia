The partition $P = \\{0, c, A\\}$ creates two subintervals:\n1.  $I_1 = [x_0, x_1] = [0, c]$\n2.  $I_2 = [x_1, x_2] = [c, A]$\n\nThe lengths of these subintervals are:\n$\\Delta x_1 = x_1 - x_0 = c - 0 = c$\n$\\Delta x_2 = x_2 - x_1 = A - c$\n\nNext, we need to find the supremum of the function $f(x)$ on each subinterval. The function is $f(x) = kx^2$. Since $k > 0$, the parabola $y=kx^2$ opens upwards. The derivative is $f'(x) = 2kx$. For $x > 0$, $f'(x) > 0$, which means the function $f(x)$ is strictly increasing on the interval $[0, A]$.\n\nFor an increasing function, the supremum on any closed interval $[a, b]$ is attained at the right endpoint, i.e., $f(b)$.\nTherefore, for our subintervals:\n$M_1 = \\sup\\{f(x) \\mid x \\in [0, c]\\} = f(c) = kc^2$\n$M_2 = \\sup\\{f(x) \\mid x \\in [c, A]\\} = f(A) = kA^2$\n\nNow we can write the expression for the upper sum $U(f, P)$:\n$U(f, P) = M_1 \\Delta x_1 + M_2 \\Delta x_2$\n$U(f, P) = (kc^2)(c) + (kA^2)(A - c)$\n$U(f, P) = kc^3 + kA^3 - kA^2c$\n\nTo find the value of $c$ that minimizes this upper sum, we can treat $U(f, P)$ as a function of $c$, let's call it $g(c)$:\n$g(c) = k(c^3 - A^2c + A^3)$, for $c \\in (0, A)$.\n\nWe can use calculus to find the minimum of $g(c)$.

Since $\\sqrt{3} > 1$, we have $0  \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{3}}  A$, so this solution is in the domain.\n\nTo confirm that this value of $c$ corresponds to a minimum, we use the second derivative test. We find the second derivative of $g(c)$:\n$\\frac{d^2g}{dc^2} = \\frac{d}{dc} [k(3c^2 - A^2)] = k(6c)$\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at the critical point $c = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{3}}$:\n$\\frac{d^2g}{dc^2}\\bigg|_{c=\\frac{A}{\\sqrt{3}}} = k\\left(6 \\cdot \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{6kA}{\\sqrt{3}} = 2\\sqrt{3}kA$\n\nSince we are given that $k > 0$ and $A > 0$, the second derivative $2\\sqrt{3}kA$ is positive. A positive second derivative indicates that the function has a local minimum at this critical point.
