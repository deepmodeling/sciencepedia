Consider the power series defined by the function $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n x^n$.\n\nYour task is twofold:\n1.  First, determine the explicit, closed-form expression for the function $f(x)$ and find its interval of convergence.\n2.  Second, consider the numerical series $S = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n(-1)^n$. Explain in your reasoning why Abel's theorem cannot be used to find a value for $S$ by evaluating a limit of $f(x)$. The core of your explanation must identify the specific condition of the theorem that is not met.\n\nWhat is the closed-form expression for the function $f(x)$?", "solution": "The problem asks for the closed-form expression of the function $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n x^n$ and an explanation of why Abel's theorem cannot be applied to the series $S = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n(-1)^n$.\n\nFirst, we find the interval of convergence for the power series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n x^n$. We can use the ratio test. Let $a_n = n x^n$.\n$$ L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \\right| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{(n+1)x^{n+1}}{nx^n} \\right| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{n+1}{n} x \\right| = |x| \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right) = |x| $$\nFor convergence, we require $L  1$, which means $|x|  1$. Thus, the radius of convergence is $R=1$, and the series converges absolutely for $x \\in (-1, 1)$.\n\nNext, we check the endpoints of the interval:\n-   At $x=1$, the series becomes $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n$, which clearly diverges to infinity.\n-   At $x=-1$, the series becomes $S = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n(-1)^n = -1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - \\dots$. The terms of this series, $a_n = n(-1)^n$, do not approach zero as $n \\to \\infty$. Specifically, $|a_n| = n \\to \\infty$. By the term test for divergence, the series diverges.\nTherefore, the interval of convergence for $f(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.\n\nNow, we find the closed-form expression for $f(x)$. We start with the well-known formula for a geometric series, which converges for $|x|1$:\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n = \\frac{1}{1-x} $$\nSince power series can be differentiated term-by-term within their interval of convergence, we differentiate both sides with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n \\right) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{1-x} \\right) $$\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n x^{n-1} = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} $$\nThe left side is almost our function $f(x)$. To get the desired form $\\sum n x^n$, we multiply the entire equation by $x$:\n$$ x \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n x^{n-1} \\right) = x \\left( \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\right) $$\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n x^n = \\frac{x}{(1-x)^2} $$\nSo, the closed-form expression for the function is $f(x) = \\frac{x}{(1-x)^2}$, valid for $x \\in (-1, 1)$.\n\nFinally, we address the second part of the problem. Abel's theorem states that if a power series $g(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} c_k x^k$ has a radius of convergence $R  0$ and if the series converges at an endpoint, say $x=R$, then the function $g(x)$ is continuous from the left at $x=R$. That is,\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to R^-} g(x) = g(R) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} c_k R^k $$\nA similar statement holds for the left endpoint $x=-R$.\n\nThe series in question is $S = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n(-1)^n$. This corresponds to evaluating the power series for $f(x)$ at the left endpoint $x=-1$. One might be tempted to calculate the sum of $S$ by evaluating the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $-1$ from the right:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to -1^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -1^+} \\frac{x}{(1-x)^2} = \\frac{-1}{(1-(-1))^2} = \\frac{-1}{2^2} = -\\frac{1}{4} $$\nHowever, Abel's theorem provides the justification for equating this limit with the sum of the series *only if a crucial hypothesis is met*. The hypothesis is that the series must converge at the endpoint in question.\n\nAs we established when determining the interval of convergence, the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n(-1)^n$ at the endpoint $x=-1$ is divergent. Since the series $S$ does not converge, it does not have a sum in the standard sense. Therefore, the primary condition for applying Abel's theorem is violated. The theorem cannot be invoked to assign the value of the limit, $-1/4$, to the divergent series $S$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{x}{(1-x)^{2}}}$$", "id": "1280377"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise showcases the remarkable power of Abel's theorem as a tool that connects disparate areas of mathematics.
