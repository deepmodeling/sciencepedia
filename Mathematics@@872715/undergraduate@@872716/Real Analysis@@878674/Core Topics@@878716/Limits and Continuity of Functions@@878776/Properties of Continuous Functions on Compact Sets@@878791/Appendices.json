It states that if $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and the function values at the endpoints, $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, have opposite signs (i.e., one is positive and the other is negative), then there must be at least one root $c$ in the open interval $(a, b)$ where $f(c) = 0$.\n\nPolynomial functions of a single variable are known to be continuous over the entire set of real numbers.\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nConsider the polynomial function given by:\n$$f(x) = x^3 - x - 1$$\nUsing the principle of the Intermediate Value Theorem, a root of this function can be guaranteed to exist within a compact interval $[k, k+1]$, where $k$ is an integer, provided that $f(k)$ and $f(k+1)$ have opposite signs.\n\nDerive the value of the smallest non-negative integer $k$ for which a root of $f(x)$ is guaranteed to exist in the interval $[k, k+1]$.", "solution": "By Bolzano’s corollary of the IVT, since $f(x)=x^3-x-1$ is a polynomial (hence continuous), a root is guaranteed in $[k,k+1]$ if \n$$f(k)\\,f(k+1)0.$$\nCompute endpoint values for non-negative integers:\n$$f(0)=0^3-0-1=-1,\\quad f(1)=1^3-1-1=-1,$$\nso \n$$f(0)\\,f(1)=(-1)(-1)=10\\quad\\text{(no sign change).}$$\nNext,\n$$f(1)=-1,\\quad f(2)=2^3-2-1=8-3=5,$$\nso\n$$f(1)\\,f(2)=(-1)(5)=-50\\quad\\text{(sign change).}$$\nThus the smallest non-negative integer $k$ for which a root lies in $[k,k+1]$ is \n$$k=1.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "20039"}, {"introduction": "The principles of continuity on compact sets are foundational for proving many deeper results in analysis.
