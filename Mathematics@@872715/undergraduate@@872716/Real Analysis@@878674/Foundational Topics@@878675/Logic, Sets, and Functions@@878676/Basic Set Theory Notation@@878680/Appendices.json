The symmetric difference is given by the formula $A \\Delta B = (A \\setminus B) \\cup (B \\setminus A)$.\n\nFirst, we must explicitly determine the elements of the sets $S$, $A$, and $B$ based on their definitions.\n\nThe universal set $S$ is the set of all positive integers less than or equal to 30.\n$S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\\}$.\n\nSet $A$ is the subset of $S$ containing all integers divisible by 3.

To find this, we take all elements of $A$ and remove any that are also present in $B$.\n$A = \\{3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30\\}$\n$B = \\{1, 4, 9, 16, 25\\}$\nThe only element common to both sets is 9.\nTherefore, removing 9 from set $A$ gives us $A \\setminus B$:\n$A \\setminus B = \\{3, 6, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30\\}$.\n\nThe set difference $B \\setminus A$ consists of all elements that are in set $B$ but not in set $A$.
