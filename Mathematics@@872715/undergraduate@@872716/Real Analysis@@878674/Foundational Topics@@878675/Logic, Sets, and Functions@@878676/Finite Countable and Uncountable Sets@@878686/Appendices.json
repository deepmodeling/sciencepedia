This problem [@problem_id:1299985] challenges us to think about the set of all integer points in three-dimensional space, framed as an infinite library. By developing a systematic method to list every point without missing any, we can directly engage with the definition of a countable set and discover that some infinities are of the same 'size' as the natural numbers.", "problem": "Imagine a conceptual, infinite library constructed as a perfect three-dimensional grid. Every potential location for a book is identified by a unique point with integer coordinates $(x, y, z)$, where $x, y, \\text{ and } z$ are all elements of the set of integers, $\\mathbb{Z} = \\{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\\}$. The library is infinitely large, extending indefinitely along the positive and negative directions of the x, y, and z axes.\n\nThe head librarian proposes a grand project: to create a universal cataloging system by assigning a unique positive integer from the set $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$ to every single book location in this infinite grid. For the project to be considered feasible, two conditions must be met: every book location must be assigned exactly one positive integer, and no two different locations can be assigned the same integer.\n\nConsider the following claims about the feasibility of this cataloging project. Which one is the only correct statement?\n\nA. The project is theoretically possible. A systematic procedure can be defined to assign a unique positive integer to every location in the grid, ensuring that every location is eventually cataloged.\n\nB. The project is impossible. The set of locations in a three-dimensional infinite grid represents a \"higher order\" of infinity than the set of positive integers, so there are not enough integers to label all the locations.\n\nC. The project would be possible for a single infinite, two-dimensional plane of the library (e.g., all locations with $z=0$), but it becomes impossible for the full three-dimensional structure.\n\nD. The project is impossible because the set of all integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is fundamentally larger than the set of positive integers $\\mathbb{N}$, as it includes negative numbers and zero, making it impossible to even label the points on a single axis.", "solution": "We are asked whether there exists a bijection between the set $\\mathbb{N}=\\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}$ and the set of integer lattice points $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}=\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}$. The project is feasible exactly when $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is countably infinite, that is, when there exists a bijection $\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$.\n\nFirst, we recall the definition: a set is countably infinite if there exists a bijection between it and $\\mathbb{N}$. We will establish the countability of $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ by constructing an explicit enumeration.\n\nStep 1: Show $\\mathbb{Z}$ is countable by giving a bijection $f:\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{N}$. Define\n$$\nf(n)=\\begin{cases}\n1,  n=0,\\\\\n2n,  n > 0,\\\\\n-2n+1,  n  0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis maps $0$ to $1$, positive integers $n$ to the even numbers $2,4,6,\\dots$, and negative integers $n$ to the odd numbers greater than $1$, namely $3,5,7,\\dots$. This mapping is injective because the three cases are disjoint in their images and strictly monotone within each case, and it is surjective onto $\\mathbb{N}$ because every positive integer is either $1$, an even number, or an odd number greater than $1$. Hence $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{N}$ have the same cardinality.\n\nStep 2: Show $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is countable by explicit enumeration. Partition $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ into the disjoint family of shells\n$$\nS_{s}=\\{(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{3}:\\ |x|+|y|+|z| = s\\}\n$$\nfor $s\\in\\mathbb{N}_{0}=\\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}$. For each fixed $s$, the set $S_{s}$ is finite because there are only finitely many integer triples whose sum of absolute values equals $s$ (each coordinate is bounded in absolute value by $s$, and only finitely many sign patterns and compositions of $s$ among three nonnegative integers exist). The sets $S_{s}$ are pairwise disjoint, and\n$$\n\\mathbb{Z}^{3}=\\bigcup_{s\\in\\mathbb{N}_{0}} S_{s}.\n$$\nTo enumerate $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, fix a deterministic ordering within each $S_{s}$, for example lexicographic order on $(x,y,z)$ with $x,y,z$ ordered by the bijection from Step 1 or by the order $0,1,-1,2,-2,\\dots$. Then list all elements of $S_{0}$ in that order, followed by all elements of $S_{1}$, then $S_{2}$, and so on. Because each $S_{s}$ is finite and the union is disjoint, concatenating these finite lists yields a sequence that contains every element of $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ exactly once. Therefore, there is a bijection $\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$.\n\nConsequences for the options:\n- A is correct because we have exhibited a systematic enumeration procedure that induces a bijection $\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, so every location can be assigned a unique positive integer.\n- B is false because $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is not a larger infinity than $\\mathbb{N}$; they have the same cardinality.\n- C is false because the argument above shows the entire three-dimensional grid is countable, just like any single plane $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.\n- D is false because $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{N}$ have the same cardinality, as shown in Step 1.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1299985"}, {"introduction": "Having established that some seemingly vast sets are in fact countable, we now turn to the nature of uncountability.

It is a standard result (via Cantor’s diagonal argument) that for any finite $m \\geq 2$, the set of all infinite sequences on $m$ symbols has cardinality $m^{\\aleph_{0}}=2^{\\aleph_{0}}$, hence $|D^{\\mathbb{N}}|=9^{\\aleph_{0}}=2^{\\aleph_{0}}$, which is uncountable.\n\nDefine the subset $E\\subset D^{\\mathbb{N}}$ consisting of sequences that are not eventually constant $9$, that is, sequences $(a_{k})$ for which there is no $N\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $a_{k}=9$ for all $k \\geq N$. The complement $D^{\\mathbb{N}}\\setminus E$ is the set of sequences that are eventually all $9$. For each $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, the set of sequences that become all $9$ from index $n$ onward is in bijection with the finite set of prefixes $(a_{1},\\dots,a_{n-1})\\in D^{n-1}$, hence there are $9^{n-1}$ such sequences for each fixed $n$. Therefore $D^{\\mathbb{N}}\\setminus E=\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}F_{n}$ with each $F_{n}$ finite, so $D^{\\mathbb{N}}\\setminus E$ is a countable union of finite sets and hence countable.

Hence $|S|=2^{\\aleph_{0}}$, so $S$ is uncountably infinite.\n\nRegarding the possible ambiguity from non-unique decimal representations (numbers with two decimal expansions are exactly those with a terminating expansion and an alternative ending in repeating $9$s), this affects only countably many numbers. Whether one defines $S$ by the existence of a no-$5$ expansion or by requiring all expansions to have no $5$, the difference between the resulting sets is at most countable, so the cardinality remains uncountable.
