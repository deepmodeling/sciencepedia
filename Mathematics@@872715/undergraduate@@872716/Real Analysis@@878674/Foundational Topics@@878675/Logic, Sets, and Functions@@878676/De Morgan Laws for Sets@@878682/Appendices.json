The system monitors a stream of network packets. An alert is triggered if a packet meets both of the following criteria:\n1. The packet originates from an external, non-whitelisted IP address.\n2. The packet's payload contains a signature matching a known malware pattern.\n\nLet `U` be the universal set of all network packets scanned by the system.\nLet `A` be the subset of packets originating from an external, non-whitelisted IP address.\nLet `B` be the subset of packets whose payload contains a known malware signature.\n\nA packet is considered \"high-risk\" if it belongs to the set `A ∩ B`. All other packets are considered \"low-risk\". The set of all low-risk packets is therefore the complement of the high-risk set, `(A ∩ B)ᶜ`.\n\nAn engineer is tasked with configuring a logging rule to record every packet that is classified as \"low-risk\".

A packet is high-risk if it satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the set of high-risk packets is the intersection of `A` and `B`.\n$$S_{\\text{high-risk}} = A \\cap B$$\n\nNext, we identify the true set of \"low-risk\" packets. This set consists of all packets that are not high-risk.

The expression `(X \\cup Y) \\setminus (X \\cap Y)` is the definition of the symmetric difference of sets `X` and `Y`, often denoted `X \\Delta Y`.\nIn our case, the set of unlogged packets is the symmetric difference of `A^{c}` and `B^{c}`.\n$$ \\text{Unlogged packets} = A^{c} \\Delta B^{c} = (A^{c} \\setminus B^{c}) \\cup (B^{c} \\setminus A^{c}) $$\nWe can simplify these terms using the identity `X \\setminus Y = X \\cap Y^{c}`.\nThe first term is `A^{c} \\setminus B^{c} = A^{c} \\cap (B^{c})^{c} = A^{c} \\cap B`.\nThe second term is `B^{c} \\setminus A^{c} = B^{c} \\cap (A^{c})^{c} = B^{c} \\cap A`.\nCombining these, the set of unlogged packets is:\n$$\\text{Unlogged packets} = (A^{c} \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap B^{c})$$\nThis expression represents the set of packets that satisfy exactly one of the two conditions: either they are from an external source but have no malware signature (`A \\cap B^{c}`), or they are not from an external source but do contain a malware signature (`A^{c} \\cap B`). These are indeed low-risk packets (since they don't satisfy both high-risk conditions), but they are missed by the engineer's logic, which requires a packet to fail *both* conditions to be logged.\n\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA. `A ∩ B`: The high-risk packets.
