We can demonstrate the density of irrational numbers by constructing a number that lies strictly between $a$ and $b$. Let's define a specific irrational number $x$ as follows: the decimal expansion of $x$ begins with the digits $0.543$, and is immediately followed by the sequence of digits formed by concatenating the decimal representations of all prime numbers in their natural increasing order (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...).\n\nCalculate the sum of the first 18 decimal digits of this number $x$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the sum of the first 18 decimal digits of a number $x$, which is constructed in a specific manner. The number $x$ is defined to have a decimal expansion that starts with $0.543$, followed by the concatenation of prime numbers in increasing order.\n\nLet the decimal expansion of $x$ be $x = 0.d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4 \\dots$.\n\nFirst, we identify the initial part of the decimal expansion. The problem states that the expansion begins with $0.543$. This gives us the first three decimal digits:\n$d_1 = 5$\n$d_2 = 4$\n$d_3 = 3$\n\nNext, we need to find the subsequent digits, which are formed by concatenating the prime numbers in order. We list the prime numbers starting from the first one, 2:\n$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, \\dots$\n\nWe will append the digits of these primes one by one after the initial '543' and keep track of the total number of digits. We need to find the digits up to the 18th position.\n\n- The first three digits are 5, 4, 3.\n- The next digit is from the prime 2.

The first digit of 29 will be our 18th decimal digit: $d_{18} = 2$.\n\nSo, the first 18 decimal digits of $x$ are:\n$5, 4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 7, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 7, 1, 9, 2, 3, 2$.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the sum of these 18 digits.\nSum = $d_1 + d_2 + \\dots + d_{18}$\nSum = $5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 2$\n\nWe can group the numbers to make the addition easier:\nSum = $(5 + 4 + 3) + (2 + 3 + 5 + 7) + (1 + 1) + (1 + 3) + (1 + 7) + (1 + 9) + (2 + 3) + 2$\nSum = $12 + 17 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 10 + 5 + 2$\nSum = $29 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 10 + 5 + 2$\nSum = $31 + 4 + 8 + 10 + 5 + 2$\nSum = $35 + 8 + 10 + 5 + 2$\nSum = $43 + 10 + 5 + 2$\nSum = $53 + 5 + 2$\nSum = $58 + 2$\nSum = $60$\n\nThe sum of the first 18 decimal digits of $x$ is 60.
