{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first practice provides a concrete application of the Well-Ordering Principle in the context of polynomials. We are asked to find the smallest positive integer $d$ that ensures a given polynomial with rational coefficients always produces an integer when multiplied by $d$ and evaluated at any integer $n$. The Well-Ordering Principle is our guarantee that since such integers $d$ exist (for instance, the common denominator of the coefficients), a smallest one must also exist, transforming an abstract principle into a specific numerical goal [@problem_id:1341003].", "problem": "Let a polynomial $P(x)$ with rational coefficients be defined as\n$$P(x) = \\frac{5}{12}x^2 - \\frac{1}{12}x$$\nFind the smallest positive integer $d$ with the property that the value $d \\cdot P(n)$ is an integer for every integer $n$.", "solution": "We are looking for the smallest positive integer $d$ such that $d \\cdot P(n)$ is an integer for all integers $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nFirst, let's write out the expression for $d \\cdot P(n)$:\n$$d \\cdot P(n) = d \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{12}n^2 - \\frac{1}{12}n\\right) = d \\cdot \\frac{5n^2 - n}{12}$$\nFor this expression to be an integer for every integer $n$, it is required that $d \\cdot (5n^2 - n)$ is divisible by $12$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's denote the integer-valued function $f(n) = 5n^2 - n$. The condition is that $d \\cdot f(n)$ must be a multiple of $12$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSince $12 = 3 \\times 4$, this requirement can be broken down into two separate divisibility conditions:\n1. $d \\cdot f(n)$ must be divisible by $3$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n2. $d \\cdot f(n)$ must be divisible by $4$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's analyze the first condition. For $d \\cdot f(n)$ to be divisible by $3$ for all integers $n$, it must hold for any specific choice of $n$. Let's test $n=1$.\n$f(1) = 5(1)^2 - 1 = 4$.\nThe condition for $n=1$ becomes: $d \\cdot 4$ must be divisible by $3$. Since $3$ is a prime number and does not divide $4$, it must divide $d$. Therefore, $d$ must be a multiple of $3$.\n\nNow let's analyze the second condition. For $d \\cdot f(n)$ to be divisible by $4$ for all integers $n$, it must hold for any specific choice of $n$. Let's test $n=2$.\n$f(2) = 5(2)^2 - 2 = 5(4) - 2 = 20 - 2 = 18$.\nThe condition for $n=2$ becomes: $d \\cdot 18$ must be divisible by $4$.\nThis can be written as $4 | 18d$, which simplifies to $2 | 9d$. Since $2$ is a prime number and does not divide $9$, it must divide $d$. Therefore, $d$ must be a multiple of $2$.\n\nCombining our findings, $d$ must be a multiple of $3$ and a multiple of $2$. For $d$ to satisfy both conditions, it must be a common multiple of $2$ and $3$. Since we are looking for the *smallest positive* integer $d$, we should choose the least common multiple of $2$ and $3$.\n$$d = \\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$$\nSo, the smallest possible value for $d$ is $6$.\n\nFinally, we must verify that $d=6$ actually works for all integers $n$, not just for the specific values we tested. If we set $d=6$, the expression we need to be an integer is:\n$$6 \\cdot P(n) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{5n^2 - n}{12} = \\frac{5n^2 - n}{2}$$\nFor this expression to be an integer, the numerator $5n^2 - n$ must be an even number for any integer $n$.\nWe can factor the numerator as $n(5n-1)$. Let's check the parity of this product.\n- If $n$ is an even integer, then the product $n(5n-1)$ is even.\n- If $n$ is an odd integer, then $5n$ is also odd. This means that $5n-1$ is an even integer. Consequently, the product $n(5n-1)$ is even.\nIn both cases, $5n^2-n$ is an even number. Therefore, $\\frac{5n^2-n}{2}$ is an integer for all integers $n$.\nOur conclusion that $d=6$ is the smallest such positive integer is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "1341003"}, {"introduction": "Our next exercise explores the concept of a 'tipping point' in the race between different types of functions—in this case, an exponential versus a polynomial. While one function may lead for small inputs, the other eventually dominates. The Well-Ordering Principle guarantees that if there is a point where the trend reverses permanently, there must be a *first* integer where this happens.

Consequently, once $h(n)$ drops below 1, it will remain less than 1 for all larger integers.\n\nIt remains to locate the threshold by checking values directly:\n- For $n=9$, we have $2^{9} = 512$ and $9^{3} = 729$. Since $512 \\le 729$, the inequality holds.\n- For $n=10$, we have $2^{10} = 1024$ and $10^{3} = 1000$. Since $1024 > 1000$, the inequality fails.\n\nBecause the ratio function $h(n)$ is strictly decreasing for all $n \\ge 4$, and the inequality fails at $n=10$, it must also fail for all $n > 10$.\nTherefore, the largest positive integer $n$ satisfying $2^{n} \\le n^{3}$ is $n=9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "1341015"}, {"introduction": "Moving from computation to pure proof, this final problem demonstrates the power of the Well-Ordering Principle's logic in establishing properties of infinite structures.

Therefore, $a_{1}$ is a record-breaking term. Hence, option A is false and any valid description must allow at least one record-breaker.\n\nStep 2: Impossibility of finitely many record-breaking terms.\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many record-breaking terms. Since this set is non-empty (it contains $a_1$), it must have a last element. Let $a_k$ be the last record-breaking term. Let $M = \\max\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k\\}$.\nBy our assumption, for any index $j > k$, the term $a_j$ is not a record-breaking term.

An infinite number of distinct terms cannot be drawn from a finite set.\nHence our assumption is false, and there must be infinitely many record-breaking terms.\n\nStep 3: Logical consequences for the options.\n- Since $a_{1}$ is always a record, zero record-breakers is impossible; thus A and the “zero” part of D are false.\n- Since finitely many record-breakers is impossible by Step 2, B and the “finite” part of D are false. Consequently, E (which asserts the possibility of constructing a sequence with exactly $M$ record-breakers for an arbitrary finite $M$) is also false.\n- Therefore, the only logical certainty for any such sequence is that it has infinitely many record-breaking terms, which is exactly option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1341000"}]}
