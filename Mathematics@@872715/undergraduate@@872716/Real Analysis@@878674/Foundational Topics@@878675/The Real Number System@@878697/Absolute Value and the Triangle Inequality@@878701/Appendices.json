The critical points where the expressions change sign are obtained from $3x - 6 = 0$ and $x + 2 = 0$, which give $x = 2$ and $x = -2$. Thus, we consider the intervals $(-\\infty, -2)$, $[-2, 2)$, and $[2, \\infty)$.\n\nRecall the definition of absolute value: for any real $a$, $|a| = a$ if $a \\ge 0$ and $|a| = -a$ if $a  0$.\n\nCase 1: $x  -2$.
