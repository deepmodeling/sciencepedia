The roots of this equation are the $n$-th roots of unity, given by $\\omega_k = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i k}{n}\\right)$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$.\nSince these are the roots, we can factor the polynomial $z^n - 1$ as:\n$$z^n - 1 = \\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (z - \\omega_k)$$\n\nWe also know the factorization of a difference of powers, which can be seen as the sum of a finite geometric series:\n$$z^n - 1 = (z-1)(z^{n-1} + z^{n-2} + \\dots + z + 1)$$\nBy equating these two forms of factorization, we get:\n$$(z-1)(z^{n-1} + z^{n-2} + \\dots + z + 1) = \\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (z - \\omega_k)$$\nThe product on the right side can be split to separate the $k=0$ term.
