A special case of this theorem is that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} z_n = 0$ if and only if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |z_n| = 0$. We will investigate the limit of the modulus of the sequence, $|z_n|$.\n\nFirst, we compute the expression for $|z_n|$. Using the properties of the modulus, specifically $|\\frac{a}{b}| = \\frac{|a|}{|b|}$ and $|ab| = |a||b|$, we have:\n$$ |z_n| = \\left| \\frac{n \\cdot e^{i n \\theta}}{n^2 + 1} \\right| = \\frac{|n| \\cdot |e^{i n \\theta}|}{|n^2 + 1|} $$\n\nNext, we evaluate the modulus of each term in this expression.\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, $n > 0$, so $|n| = n$.\nThe term $n^2 + 1$ is also always positive for any integer $n$, so $|n^2 + 1| = n^2 + 1$.\nThe term $e^{i n \\theta}$ is a complex number of the form $e^{i\\phi}$ where $\\phi = n\\theta$ is a real number. The modulus of such a number is always 1. This can be seen from Euler's formula, $e^{i\\phi} = \\cos(\\phi) + i\\sin(\\phi)$, which gives:\n$$ |e^{i\\phi}| = |\\cos(\\phi) + i\\sin(\\phi)| = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\phi) + \\sin^2(\\phi)} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 $$\nTherefore, $|e^{i n \\theta}| = 1$ for any $n$ and $\\theta$.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $|z_n|$, we get:\n$$ |z_n| = \\frac{n \\cdot 1}{n^2 + 1} = \\frac{n}{n^2 + 1} $$\n\nNow, we need to find the limit of this sequence of real numbers as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |z_n| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{n^2 + 1} $$\nThis is a limit of a rational function in $n$. To evaluate it, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of $n$ in the denominator, which is $n^2$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{n}{n^2}}{\\frac{n^2}{n^2} + \\frac{1}{n^2}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{n}}{1 + \\frac{1}{n^2}} $$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the terms $\\frac{1}{n}$ and $\\frac{1}{n^2}$ both approach 0. Substituting these limiting values, we find:\n$$ \\frac{0}{1 + 0} = 0 $$\nSo, we have shown that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |z_n| = 0$.\n\nBased on the theorem mentioned at the beginning, since the limit of the modulus of the sequence is 0, the limit of the complex sequence itself must also be 0.\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} z_n = 0 $$\nThe limit is the complex number $0$, which can also be written as $0+0i$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2236528"}, {"introduction": "A complex sequence converges only if its real and imaginary parts independently converge.
