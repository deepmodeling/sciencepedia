The summation term $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n (z-z_0)^n$ represents the analytic part of $f'(z)$ at $z_0$.

A point $z_0$ around which a function is multi-valued is, by definition, a branch point.\n\nThe singularity at $z_0$ is not isolated in the standard sense because a Laurent series (which requires a single-valued function) cannot be defined for $f(z)$ in any punctured neighborhood of $z_0$.
