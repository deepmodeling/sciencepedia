{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A crucial skill in complex analysis is determining the order of a zero of an analytic function. This tells us not just that the function is zero at a point, but *how quickly* it approaches zero. This hands-on exercise challenges you to find the order of a zero at the origin by using Maclaurin series expansions, a primary tool for investigating the local behavior of analytic functions [@problem_id:2248487].", "problem": "Consider the complex-valued function $f(z)$ defined for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ by the expression:\n$$f(z) = \\exp(z^2) - 1 - z^2 \\cos(z)$$\nThe function $f(z)$ has a zero at the origin, $z=0$. Determine the order of this zero. Your answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "We determine the order of the zero at the origin by finding the first nonzero term in the Taylor expansion of $f(z)$ around $z=0$. Since $\\exp$ and $\\cos$ are entire, we can use their Maclaurin series:\n$$\\exp(z^{2})=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{z^{2k}}{k!}=1+z^{2}+\\frac{z^{4}}{2!}+\\frac{z^{6}}{3!}+\\cdots,$$\n$$\\cos(z)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{n}z^{2n}}{(2n)!}=1-\\frac{z^{2}}{2!}+\\frac{z^{4}}{4!}-\\frac{z^{6}}{6!}+\\cdots.$$\nThen\n$$-z^{2}\\cos(z)=-z^{2}+\\frac{z^{4}}{2!}-\\frac{z^{6}}{4!}+\\frac{z^{8}}{6!}-\\cdots.$$\nTherefore,\n$$f(z)=\\bigl(\\exp(z^{2})-1\\bigr)-z^{2}\\cos(z)=\\left(z^{2}+\\frac{z^{4}}{2!}+\\frac{z^{6}}{3!}+\\frac{z^{8}}{4!}+\\cdots\\right)+\\left(-z^{2}+\\frac{z^{4}}{2!}-\\frac{z^{6}}{4!}+\\frac{z^{8}}{6!}-\\cdots\\right).$$\nThe $z^{2}$ terms cancel. The coefficient of $z^{4}$ is\n$$\\frac{1}{2!}+\\frac{1}{2!}=\\frac{2}{2!}=1,$$\nwhich is nonzero. Hence the first nonzero term is $z^{4}$. The next terms, such as the $z^{6}$ term with coefficient $\\frac{1}{3!}-\\frac{1}{4!}\\neq 0$, confirm there is no earlier nonzero term than $z^{4}$.
