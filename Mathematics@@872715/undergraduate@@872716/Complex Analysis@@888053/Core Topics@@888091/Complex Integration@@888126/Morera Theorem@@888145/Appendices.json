We must show that $f(z)$ is entire using Morera's theorem. To do this, we need to verify two conditions for $f(z)$ on the domain $D=\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n1.  **Continuity**: Each function $f_n(z)$ is a polynomial, and is therefore continuous on $\\mathbb{C}$. A standard theorem in analysis states that the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous. Since $f_n \\to f$ uniformly on any compact subset of $\\mathbb{C}$, the limit function $f(z)$ is continuous on any such set, and therefore continuous on all of $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n2.  **Integral over closed triangles**: Let $T$ be any closed triangle in the complex plane. We need to show that $\\oint_T f(z) dz = 0$. The trace of $T$ is a compact set in $\\mathbb{C}$, so the convergence $f_n(z) \\to f(z)$ is uniform on $T$. This allows us to exchange the limit and the integral:\n    $$ \\oint_T f(z) dz = \\oint_T \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f_n(z) dz = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\oint_T f_n(z) dz $$\n    Each $f_n(z)$ is a polynomial, which is an entire function. By Cauchy's Integral Theorem, the integral of any entire function over a closed contour is zero. Thus, for every $n$:\n    $$ \\oint_T f_n(z) dz = 0 $$\n    Taking the limit, we get:\n    $$ \\oint_T f(z) dz = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 0 = 0 $$\n    Since $f(z)$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{C}$ and its integral over any closed triangle is zero, Morera's theorem confirms that $f(z)$ is an entire function.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the explicit form of $f(z)$**\n\nThe function $f(z)$ is the solution to the IVP $f'(z) = f(z)$ with $f(0)=1$. This is a first-order separable differential equation.\n$$ \\frac{df}{dz} = f \\implies \\frac{df}{f} = dz $$\nIntegrating both sides gives:\n$$ \\ln(f) = z + C $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. Exponentiating both sides:\n$$ f(z) = e^{z+C} = A e^z $$\nwhere $A = e^C$. We use the initial condition $f(0)=1$ to find $A$:\n$$ f(0) = 1 \\implies A e^0 = 1 \\implies A = 1 $$\nThus, the unique solution to the IVP is $f(z) = e^z$.
