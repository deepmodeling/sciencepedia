This exercise provides a direct and concrete answer by asking you to compute the integral of a simple, non-analytic function, $f(z) = \\text{Im}(z)$, along two distinct paths. By directly comparing the results, you will witness the phenomenon of path dependence, a crucial concept that motivates the study of analytic functions for which path independence holds under certain conditions.

We must compute each integral separately and then find their difference. The function is $f(z) = \\text{Im}(z)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the integral $I_1$ along the straight line path $C_1$ from $z_1 = 0$ to $z_2 = 1 - i$.\nA parametrization for the straight line segment from a point $a$ to a point $b$ is $z(t) = a + t(b-a)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nFor path $C_1$, we have $a=0$ and $b=1-i$.\nSo, the parametrization is $z(t) = 0 + t(1-i - 0) = t(1-i) = t - it$, for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nFrom this parametrization, we have $x(t) = t$ and $y(t) = -t$.\nThe function $f(z)$ evaluated on the path is $f(z(t)) = \\text{Im}(z(t)) = y(t) = -t$.\nThe differential element $dz$ is found by differentiating $z(t)$ with respect to $t$: $z'(t) = \\frac{dz}{dt} = 1 - i$.
