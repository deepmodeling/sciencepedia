The terms $\\frac{1}{z^{2}(z-2)}$, $\\frac{1}{4(2-z)}$, and $-\\frac{1}{4 z^{2}}$ suggest possible singularities at $z=0$ and $z=2$. To determine whether these are poles and of what order, we simplify $f(z)$ and check for cancellations.\n\nRewrite $\\frac{1}{4(2-z)}$ as $-\\frac{1}{4(z-2)}$. Then\n$$\nf(z)=\\frac{1}{z^{2}(z-2)}-\\frac{1}{4(z-2)}-\\frac{1}{4 z^{2}}.\n$$\nCombine over the common denominator $4z^{2}(z-2)$:\n$$\nf(z)=\\frac{4}{4z^{2}(z-2)}-\\frac{z^{2}}{4 z^{2}(z-2)}-\\frac{z-2}{4 z^{2}(z-2)}\n=\\frac{4-z^{2}-(z-2)}{4z^{2}(z-2)}\n=\\frac{4-z^{2}-z+2}{4z^{2}(z-2)}.\n$$\nThus the numerator simplifies to\n$$\n6-z-z^{2}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\nf(z)=\\frac{6-z-z^{2}}{4\\,z^{2}(z-2)}.\n$$\nFactor the numerator:\n$$\n6-z-z^{2}=-(z^{2}+z-6)=-(z-2)(z+3),\n$$\nso\n$$\nf(z)=\\frac{-(z-2)(z+3)}{4\\,z^{2}(z-2)}=-\\frac{z+3}{4 z^{2}},\n$$\nfor $z\\neq 0,2$. This shows the factor $(z-2)$ cancels, so $z=2$ is a removable singularity (not a pole), because after cancellation the simplified expression is analytic at $z=2$.\n\nTo determine the behavior at $z=0$, use the definition: $z=0$ is a pole of order $m$ if $z^{m} f(z)$ is analytic and nonzero at $z=0$, and $m$ is minimal. From the simplified form,\n$$\nf(z)=-\\frac{z+3}{4 z^{2}}.\n$$\nThen\n$$\nz^{2} f(z)=-\\frac{z+3}{4},\n$$\nwhich is analytic at $z=0$ and equals $-\\frac{3}{4}\\neq 0$. Therefore, $z=0$ is a pole of order $2$.\n\nThere are no other poles. In particular, $z=2$ is not a pole (removable), $z=-3$ is a zero of the numerator, not a singularity, and the function is not entire due to the pole at $z=0$.
