The first quadrant is a sector with an opening angle of $\\pi/2$. The principle states that if a function, say $h(z)$, is analytic in the interior of the sector, continuous on its boundary, bounded by some constant $B$ on the boundary rays, and satisfies a specific growth condition, then it must be bounded by $B$ throughout the entire sector.\n\nThe growth condition for a sector of angle $\\beta$ requires that the function grows slower than $\\exp(|z|^{\\pi/\\beta})$. For the first quadrant, $\\beta=\\pi/2$, so the critical growth power is $\\pi/(\\pi/2)=2$.

The boundary of the first quadrant consists of two rays: the non-negative real axis ($z=x$, for $x \\ge 0$) and the non-negative imaginary axis ($z=iy$, for $y \\ge 0$).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the behavior of $|h(z)|$ on the non-negative real axis. For $z=x$ where $x \\ge 0$, the argument is $\\arg(z)=0$. The principal branch of the square root is $z^{1/2} = x^{1/2}$.\nThe magnitude of the auxiliary function is $|g(x)| = |\\exp(-A x^{1/2})| = \\exp(-A \\sqrt{x})$.\nThe magnitude of the product function $h(x)$ is therefore:\n$|h(x)| = |f(x)| |g(x)| \\le B_1 \\exp(-A \\sqrt{x})$.\nTo ensure $|h(x)|$ is bounded for all $x \\ge 0$, we need the exponential term not to grow.

If $A \\ge 0$, then $\\exp(-A\\sqrt{x}) \\le 1$ for all $x \\ge 0$, so $|h(x)| \\le B_1$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the behavior of $|h(z)|$ on the non-negative imaginary axis. For $z=iy$ where $y \\ge 0$, the argument is $\\arg(z)=\\pi/2$. The principal branch of the square root is $z^{1/2} = (y e^{i\\pi/2})^{1/2} = \\sqrt{y} e^{i\\pi/4}$.\n$z^{1/2} = \\sqrt{y} (\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) + i\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{4})) = \\sqrt{y} (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})$.\nThe auxiliary function is $g(iy) = \\exp(-A(\\sqrt{y}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})))$.\nThe magnitude of $g(iy)$ is determined by the real part of its exponent:\n$|g(iy)| = |\\exp(-\\frac{A\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt{2}} - i\\frac{A\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt{2}})| = \\exp(-\\frac{A\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt{2}})$.\nThe magnitude of the product function $h(iy)$ is:\n$|h(iy)| = |f(iy)| |g(iy)| \\le B_2 \\exp(\\alpha \\sqrt{y}) \\exp(-\\frac{A\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt{2}})$.\nCombining the exponents, we get:\n$|h(iy)| \\le B_2 \\exp(\\sqrt{y} (\\alpha - \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{2}}))$.\nFor $|h(iy)|$ to be bounded as $y \\to \\infty$, the coefficient of $\\sqrt{y}$ in the exponent must be less than or equal to zero.\n$\\alpha - \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{2}} \\le 0$.\nThis implies $\\alpha \\le \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{2}}$, which can be rearranged to find the condition on $A$:\n$A \\ge \\alpha \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe have two conditions for $A$: $A \\ge 0$ and $A \\ge \\alpha\\sqrt{2}$.
