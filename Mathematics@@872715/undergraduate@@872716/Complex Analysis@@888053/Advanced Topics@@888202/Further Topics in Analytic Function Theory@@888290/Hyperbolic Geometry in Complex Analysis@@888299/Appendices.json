The hyperbolic circle is centered at the origin $z_0=0$ and has a hyperbolic radius $R$.\n\nBy definition, any point $z$ on this hyperbolic circle must satisfy the condition $d_H(z, 0) = R$. The Euclidean radius of the circle is simply the Euclidean distance of any such point $z$ from the origin, which is $r_E = |z|$. Our goal is to find an expression for $r_E$ in terms of $R$.\n\nWe are given the general formula for the hyperbolic distance between two points $z_1$ and $z_2$:\n$$d_H(z_1, z_2) = \\text{arccosh}\\left(1 + \\frac{2|z_1 - z_2|^2}{(1-|z_1|^2)(1-|z_2|^2)}\\right)$$\nLet's apply this formula to find the distance between a point $z$ and the origin $z_0=0$.
