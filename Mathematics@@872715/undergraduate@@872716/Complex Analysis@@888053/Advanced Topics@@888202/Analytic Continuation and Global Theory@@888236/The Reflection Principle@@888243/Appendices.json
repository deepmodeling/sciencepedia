This first exercise provides a direct and fundamental application of the principle, allowing you to see how knowledge of a function in the upper half-plane can determine its values in the lower half-plane, provided it behaves nicely on the real axis. Mastering this core calculation is the first step toward using the principle in more complex scenarios.", "problem": "Consider a function $f(z)$ that is analytic in the open upper half-plane, defined as the set of all complex numbers $z = x+iy$ where $y > 0$. It is known that for any real number $x$, the value of the function $f(x)$ is a real number. A specific measurement reveals that the function's value at the point $z=i$ is $f(i) = 2 - 3i$. The function $f(z)$ can be analytically continued to a larger domain that includes the lower half-plane. What is the value of this analytic continuation at the point $z = -i$?", "solution": "We use the Schwarz reflection principle. Since $f$ is analytic in the upper half-plane and satisfies $f(x)\\in\\mathbb{R}$ for every real $x$, we can define an analytic continuation $F$ to the lower half-plane by\n$$\nF(z)=\n\\begin{cases}\nf(z),  \\text{if } \\operatorname{Im} z0,\\\\\n\\overline{f(\\overline{z})},  \\text{if } \\operatorname{Im} z0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFirst, note that the map $z\\mapsto \\overline{z}$ takes the lower half-plane to the upper half-plane. Since $f$ is analytic on the upper half-plane, the composition $z\\mapsto f(\\overline{z})$ is analytic on the lower half-plane, and complex conjugation preserves analyticity when applied to the values, so $z\\mapsto \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$ is analytic on the lower half-plane. On the real axis, for $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, we have\n$$\n\\overline{f(\\overline{x})}=\\overline{f(x)}=f(x),\n$$\nusing that $f(x)$ is real. Hence the two definitions agree on the real axis, so $F$ is an analytic continuation of $f$ across the real axis to include the lower half-plane.\n\nTo compute the analytically continued value at $z=-i$ (which lies in the lower half-plane), we use the defining formula:\n$$\nF(-i)=\\overline{f(\\overline{-i})}=\\overline{f(i)}.\n$$\nGiven $f(i)=2-3i$, we obtain\n$$\nF(-i)=\\overline{2-3i}=2+3i.\n$$\nThus, the value of the analytic continuation at $z=-i$ is $2+3i$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2+3i}$$", "id": "2282929"}, {"introduction": "A common mistake when applying powerful theorems is to overlook their initial assumptions, leading to incorrect conclusions. This practice problem serves as a crucial check on your understanding, asking you to determine why the Schwarz Reflection Principle cannot be applied to the function $f(z) = \\exp(iz)$. It highlights the importance of rigorously verifying the condition that the function must be real-valued on the boundary before attempting a reflection.", "problem": "Let $U = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\text{Im}(z) > 0\\}$ be the open upper half-plane. Consider the function $f(z) = \\exp(iz)$ defined on $U$. The Schwarz Reflection Principle provides conditions under which a function can be analytically continued across a segment of the real axis. These conditions relate to the function's analyticity in a domain, its continuity on the boundary, and the nature of its values on that boundary segment.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies why the Schwarz Reflection Principle, as it is standardly formulated for reflection across the real axis, cannot be applied to extend $f(z)$ from $U$ to a larger domain?\n\nA. The function $f(z)$ is not analytic in the upper half-plane $U$.\n\nB. The function $f(z)$ is not continuous up to the boundary of $U$ (the real axis).\n\nC. The function $f(z)$ does not take purely real values for all points on the real axis.\n\nD. The function $f(z)$ satisfies all the necessary conditions, and therefore the principle can be applied.\n\nE. The derivative of the function, $f'(z)$, is not real on the real axis.", "solution": "We consider $U=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}\\mid \\operatorname{Im}(z)0\\}$ and $f(z)=\\exp(i z)$. The classical Schwarz Reflection Principle across the real axis states: if a function $g$ is analytic on a domain in the upper half-plane that meets an open interval $I\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ on the boundary, extends continuously to $I$, and satisfies $g(x)\\in\\mathbb{R}$ for all $x\\in I$, then $g$ extends analytically across $I$ to the reflected domain by defining\n$$\nG(z)=\\begin{cases}\ng(z),  \\operatorname{Im}(z)\\geq 0,\\\\\n\\overline{g(\\overline{z})},  \\operatorname{Im}(z)0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe test these hypotheses for $f(z)=\\exp(i z)$ on $U$. First, $f$ is entire, hence analytic on $U$, so the analyticity condition is satisfied. Second, being entire, $f$ is continuous on $U$ and extends continuously to the real axis, so the boundary continuity condition is satisfied. Third, we evaluate the boundary values on the real axis: for $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$,\n$$\nf(x)=\\exp(i x)=\\cos(x)+i\\sin(x).\n$$\nThis is not real for general $x$, since $\\sin(x)$ is not identically zero. Therefore, the key condition that $f$ take real values on an interval of the real axis fails. Consequently, the standard formulation of the Schwarz Reflection Principle across the real line cannot be applied to extend $f$ from $U$ by reflection.\n\nThus, among the options given, the correct reason is that $f$ does not take purely real values on the real axis, which corresponds to option C. (Note that although $f$ is entire and already defined on a larger domain, the question concerns the inapplicability of the standard reflection hypothesis.)", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2281388"}, {"introduction": "The Reflection Principle is deeply connected to the underlying symmetries of functions and the properties of their coefficients.
