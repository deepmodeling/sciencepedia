The final answer must be a single analytic expression.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the largest integer $k$ such that $p^{k} \\mid a^{m} b^{n}$. This integer $k$ is, by definition, the exact multiplicity of the prime $p$ in the integer $a^m b^n$. For any nonzero integer $z$ and prime $p$, let us denote this multiplicity by $\\nu_p(z)$. The problem provides that $\\nu_p(a) = \\alpha$ and $\\nu_p(b) = \\beta$. Our goal is to find an expression for $k = \\nu_p(a^m b^n)$ in terms of $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $m$, and $n$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by first establishing the fundamental properties of the function $\\nu_p$ using the allowed tools: core definitions of divisibility and properties of primes, including the consequences of Bézout's identity.\n\nBy the definition given, $\\nu_p(z) = \\gamma$ means that $p^{\\gamma} \\mid z$ and $p^{\\gamma+1} \\nmid z$. This implies that $z$ can be written in the form $z = p^{\\gamma}z'$, where $z'$ is an integer not divisible by $p$. Consequently, we can write $a = p^{\\alpha}a'$ and $b = p^{\\beta}b'$, where $a'$ and $b'$ are integers such that $p \\nmid a'$ and $p \\nmid b'$.\n\nFirst, we establish the additive property of the $p$-adic valuation: $\\nu_p(xy) = \\nu_p(x) + \\nu_p(y)$ for any nonzero integers $x$ and $y$.\nLet $\\nu_p(x) = u$ and $\\nu_p(y) = v$. We can write $x = p^u x'$ and $y = p^v y'$, where $p \\nmid x'$ and $p \\nmid y'$.\nThe product $xy$ is then:\n$$xy = (p^u x')(p^v y') = p^{u+v} x'y'$$\nTo determine $\\nu_p(xy)$, we must analyze the divisibility of the term $x'y'$ by $p$. For this, we use a fundamental property of primes, often referred to as Euclid's Lemma: if a prime divides a product of two integers, it must divide at least one of them. This lemma is a direct consequence of Bézout's identity, which is an allowed tool. If $p \\mid c d$ and $p \\nmid c$, then because $p$ is prime, $\\gcd(p, c) = 1$. By Bézout's identity, integers $r$ and $s$ exist such that $rp + sc = 1$. Multiplying by $d$ yields $rpd + scd = d$. Since $p$ divides $rpd$ and $p$ divides $scd$ (as $p \\mid cd$), $p$ must divide their sum, which is $d$.\n\nNow, let us assume for contradiction that $p \\mid x'y'$. Applying Euclid's Lemma, we must have $p \\mid x'$ or $p \\mid y'$. This, however, contradicts the established conditions that $p \\nmid x'$ and $p \\nmid y'$. Therefore, the assumption $p \\mid x'y'$ must be false.\nWith $p \\nmid x'y'$, the expression $xy = p^{u+v}(x'y')$ shows that the highest power of $p$ that divides $xy$ is $p^{u+v}$. By definition, this means $\\nu_p(xy) = u+v$. We have thus formally shown that:\n$$\\nu_p(xy) = \\nu_p(x) + \\nu_p(y)$$\n\nSecond, we establish the power rule: $\\nu_p(z^j) = j \\cdot \\nu_p(z)$ for any positive integer $j$. This follows from the additive property by induction.\nBase Case: For $j=1$, $\\nu_p(z^1) = \\nu_p(z) = 1 \\cdot \\nu_p(z)$, which is correct.\nInductive Step: Assume the property holds for some positive integer $j=i$, so $\\nu_p(z^i) = i \\cdot \\nu_p(z)$. We then examine the case for $j=i+1$:\n$$\\nu_p(z^{i+1}) = \\nu_p(z^i \\cdot z)$$\nUsing the additive property derived above:\n$$\\nu_p(z^i \\cdot z) = \\nu_p(z^i) + \\nu_p(z)$$\nApplying the inductive hypothesis:\n$$\\nu_p(z^i) + \\nu_p(z) = i \\cdot \\nu_p(z) + \\nu_p(z) = (i+1)\\nu_p(z)$$\nThus, $\\nu_p(z^{i+1}) = (i+1)\\nu_p(z)$. By the principle of mathematical induction, the power rule $\\nu_p(z^j) = j \\cdot \\nu_p(z)$ is valid for all positive integers $j$.\n\nWith these two properties, we can now determine the required value $k = \\nu_p(a^m b^n)$.\nUsing the additive property on the product of $a^m$ and $b^n$:\n$$k = \\nu_p(a^m b^n) = \\nu_p(a^m) + \\nu_p(b^n)$$\nUsing the power rule for each term:\n$$\\nu_p(a^m) = m \\cdot \\nu_p(a)$$\n$$\\nu_p(b^n) = n \\cdot \\nu_p(b)$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $k$:\n$$k = m \\cdot \\nu_p(a) + n \\cdot \\nu_p(b)$$\nFinally, using the given values $\\nu_p(a) = \\alpha$ and $\\nu_p(b) = \\beta$:\n$$k = m\\alpha + n\\beta$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the largest integer $k$ satisfying the condition.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{m\\alpha + n\\beta}\n$$", "id": "3084819"}, {"introduction": "With the theoretical foundation in place, we can explore how the properties of primes lead to elegant solutions for seemingly complex equations.

We are asked to find the value of the expression $x+3y$ for the unique integer solution. The solution must be derived using fundamental principles of number theory.\n\nFirst, we validate the premise that $p=2029$ is indeed a prime number. An integer $p>1$ is prime if its only positive divisors are $1$ and $p$. To test for primality, we check for factors up to $\\sqrt{2029}$. Since $45^2 = 2025$, we have $\\sqrt{2029} \\approx 45.04$. The prime numbers less than $45$ are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43$.\n- $2029$ is not divisible by $2$ as it is odd.\n- The sum of digits is $2+0+2+9=13$, which is not divisible by $3$.\n- It does not end in $0$ or $5$, so it is not divisible by $5$.\n- Division by the remaining primes ($7, 11, 13, \\dots, 43$) yields non-integer results.\nThus, $2029$ has no prime factors less than its square root, confirming that $p=2029$ is a prime number. The problem statement is valid.\n\nThe given equation is:\n$$x^2 - y^2 = p$$\nThe left-hand side is a difference of squares, which can be factored as:\n$$(x-y)(x+y) = p$$\nWe are given that $x$ and $y$ are integers. Therefore, the terms $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$ must be integer divisors of $p$.\n\nAccording to the foundational definition of a prime number, the only integer divisors of a prime $p$ are $\\pm 1$ and $\\pm p$. This leads to the following possible pairs for $(x-y, x+y)$:\n$$(1, p), (p, 1), (-1, -p), (-p, -1)$$\n\nWe now use the constraints $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$ to analyze these possibilities.\nThe sum $x+y$ must be non-negative. If $x+y = 0$, then $x=y=0$ (since $x,y \\ge 0$), which would mean $x^2-y^2=0$, contradicting $x^2-y^2=p=2029$. Therefore, $x+y$ must be strictly positive.\nSince $(x-y)(x+y) = p > 0$ and $x+y > 0$, it must be that the factor $(x-y)$ is also strictly positive.\nThis eliminates the pairs $(-1, -p)$ and $(-p, -1)$, as both factors would have to be positive.\n\nWe are left with two possibilities:\n1. $x-y = 1$ and $x+y = p$\n2. $x-y = p$ and $x+y = 1$\n\nFurthermore, since $y \\ge 0$, we have $x+y \\ge x$. Also, $x-y \\le x$. If $y > 0$, then $x+y > x-y$. If $y=0$, then $x+y = x-y = x$, which would imply $x^2 = p$. However, $p=2029$ is not a perfect square (as it is a prime number), so no integer $x$ exists such that $x^2=2029$. Therefore, we must have $y>0$.\nThe condition $y>0$ implies that $x+y > x-y$.\n\nComparing the two remaining possibilities, the only one that satisfies the condition $x+y > x-y$ is the first one.\nThis leads to a unique system of linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx - y = 1 \\\\\nx + y = p\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe existence of this unique system confirms the problem's claim of a unique solution under the given constraints.\n\nWe now solve this system for $x$ and $y$ by substituting $p=2029$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx - y = 1 \\\\\nx + y = 2029\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAdding the two equations together:\n$$(x-y) + (x+y) = 1 + 2029$$\n$$2x = 2030$$\n$$x = \\frac{2030}{2} = 1015$$\nSubstituting the value of $x$ into the first equation:\n$$1015 - y = 1$$\n$$y = 1015 - 1 = 1014$$\nThe unique solution is $(x, y) = (1015, 1014)$.

By the definition of divisibility, this means there exists an integer $k$ such that $b(p+q)c = ka$.\nSubstituting the given expressions for $a$ and $b$:\n$$\n(p^{2}q^{3})(p+q)c = k(p^{2}q^{3}rs)\n$$\nSince $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, $p=13$ and $q=17$, they are non-zero. Thus, the term $p^{2}q^{3}$ is non-zero, and we can legally divide both sides of the equation by it:\n$$\n(p+q)c = k(rs)\n$$\nThis equation is equivalent to the divisibility condition $rs \\mid (p+q)c$.\n\nThe integers $r=5$ and $s=11$ are distinct prime numbers. A fundamental property of divisibility is that if two coprime integers divide a number, their product also divides that number. Since $r$ and $s$ are distinct primes, their greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(r,s)=1$. Therefore, the condition $rs \\mid (p+q)c$ is equivalent to the simultaneous conditions $r \\mid (p+q)c$ and $s \\mid (p+q)c$.\n\nLet's analyze the first of these conditions: $r \\mid (p+q)c$.\nWe are given that $\\gcd(c, pqr) = 1$. A direct consequence of the definition of the greatest common divisor is that if an integer is coprime to a product of integers, it is coprime to each of those integers. Since $r$ is a factor of $pqr$, the condition $\\gcd(c, pqr)=1$ implies that $\\gcd(c, r) = 1$.\n\nNow we use a foundational result of number theory that follows from Bézout's identity. If an integer $m$ divides a product $nk$ and is coprime to one of the factors, say $\\gcd(m, n) = 1$, then $m$ must divide the other factor $k$. We shall justify this. By Bézout's identity, $\\gcd(m, n) = 1$ implies there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $mx + ny = 1$. Multiplying this entire equation by $k$ gives $mkx + nky = k$. We are given that $m \\mid nk$, so there exists an integer $j$ such that $nk = jm$. Substituting this into our equation yields $mkx + (jm)y = k$. Factoring out $m$, we get $m(kx + jy) = k$. Since $k$, $x$, $j$, and $y$ are all integers, the term $(kx+jy)$ is also an integer. By the definition of divisibility, this means $m \\mid k$.\n\nApplying this principle to our condition $r \\mid (p+q)c$, we identify $m=r$, $n=c$, and $k=(p+q)$. We have already established that $\\gcd(r, c) = 1$. Therefore, it must be true that $r \\mid (p+q)$.\nLet's verify this with the given numerical values: $r=5$, $p=13$, $q=17$.\n$p+q = 13 + 17 = 30$.\nThe condition becomes $5 \\mid 30$, which is true since $30 = 6 \\times 5$. This part of the divisibility requirement is satisfied by the given numbers and imposes no further constraints on the integer $c$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the second condition: $s \\mid (p+q)c$.\nWe apply the same principle as before. We will check the relationship between $s$ and $(p+q)$. The integer $s$ is the prime number $11$, and $p+q=30$. Since $11$ is prime, its only positive divisors are $1$ and $11$. As $11$ does not divide $30$, their greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(s, p+q) = \\gcd(11, 30) = 1$.\n\nApplying the principle derived from Bézout's identity to $s \\mid (p+q)c$, we identify $m=s$, $n=(p+q)$, and $k=c$. Since we have just shown that $\\gcd(s, p+q) = 1$, it must be that $s \\mid c$.\n\nSo, we have deduced that any integer $c$ that satisfies the given conditions must be a multiple of $s$. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer $c$. The positive multiples of $s=11$ are $11, 22, 33, \\dots$. The smallest of these is $c=s=11$.\n\nWe must verify that this candidate, $c=11$, satisfies all the initial conditions.\n$1$. $c$ must be a positive integer. $c=11$ is a positive integer.\n$2$. The divisibility condition $a \\mid b(p+q)c$ must hold. We showed this is equivalent to $rs \\mid (p+q)c$. With $c=s=11$, this becomes $rs \\mid (p+q)s$. Since $s \\neq 0$, this simplifies to $r \\mid (p+q)$, which we have already verified is true ($5 \\mid 30$).\n$3$. The condition $\\gcd(c, pqr)=1$ must hold. For $c=s=11$, this condition is $\\gcd(11, 13 \\times 17 \\times 5) = 1$. The integer $c=11$ is a prime number. The other integers $p=13$, $q=17$, and $r=5$ are also prime numbers, all distinct from $11$. Therefore, $c=11$ shares no common prime factors with the product $pqr$. The greatest common divisor is thus $1$. This condition is satisfied.\n\nSince any valid $c$ must be a multiple of $11$, and $c=11$ itself satisfies all conditions, it is the smallest such positive integer.\nThe smallest positive integer $c$ is $11$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{11}\n$$", "id": "3084815"}]}
