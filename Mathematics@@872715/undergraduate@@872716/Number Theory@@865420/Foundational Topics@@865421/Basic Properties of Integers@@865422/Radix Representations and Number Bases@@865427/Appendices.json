The problem is well-defined and requires justification based on the definition of base-$b$ expansions and the formula for a finite geometric series.\n\nFirst, we will establish the base-$b$ representation of $n = b^k - 1$. The problem statement directs us to use the formula for a finite geometric series, which is given by $\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} r^i = \\frac{r^m - 1}{r-1}$ for $r \\neq 1$.\n\nLet us consider a number whose base-$b$ representation consists of $k$ digits, each equal to the value $b-1$. The value of such a number is given by the polynomial in $b$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (b-1)b^i $$\nWe can factor out the constant term $(b-1)$ from the summation:\n$$ (b-1) \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} b^i $$\nThe sum $\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} b^i$ is a finite geometric series with the first term being $b^0 = 1$, the common ratio being $b$, and there being $k$ terms in the sum (from $i=0$ to $i=k-1$). Since the problem specifies $b \\geq 2$, the ratio $b$ is not equal to $1$. We can apply the standard formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} b^i = \\frac{b^k - 1}{b - 1} $$\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for the number's value, we get:\n$$ (b-1) \\left( \\frac{b^k - 1}{b - 1} \\right) $$\nSince $b \\geq 2$, $b-1 \\neq 0$, so we can cancel the $(b-1)$ terms in the numerator and denominator, which yields:\n$$ b^k - 1 $$\nThis is precisely the definition of the integer $n$. Thus, we have shown that $n = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (b-1)b^i$.\n\nNow, we must rigorously justify why this is the unique base-$b$ representation of $n$. A base-$b$ representation of a non-negative integer $m$ is an expression of the form $m = \\sum_{i=0}^{t} d_i b^i$, where the coefficients $d_i$, called the digits, must satisfy the condition $0 \\leq d_i \\leq b-1$ for all $i$. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic for number bases guarantees that for any given integer base $b \\geq 2$, every non-negative integer has a unique such representation.\n\nIn our expression $n = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (b-1)b^i$, the coefficients are $d_i = b-1$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, k-1$. We must check if these coefficients are valid digits in base $b$. The condition is $0 \\leq d_i \\leq b-1$. For our coefficients, $d_i = b-1$. Since $b$ is an integer and $b \\geq 2$, we have $b-1 \\geq 1$. Thus, the inequality $0 \\leq b-1 \\leq b-1$ is satisfied.\nSince we have found an expansion for $n$ in the form of a sum of powers of $b$ with coefficients that are valid digits, and since this representation is unique, we have successfully determined the base-$b$ representation of $n$. This representation consists of $k$ digits (as the highest power of $b$ is $b^{k-1}$), and each digit $d_i$ for $i=0, \\dots, k-1$ is equal to $b-1$. In positional notation, this would be written as the string of $k$ digits $(b-1)(b-1)\\dots(b-1)_b$.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute the base-$b$ digit-sum of $n$, denoted by $s_b(n)$. The function $s_b(m)$ is defined as the sum of the digits of $m$ in its base-$b$ representation: $s_b(m) = \\sum_{i=0}^{t} d_i$.\nFor our integer $n$, the representation is $n = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (b-1)b^i$. The digits are $d_i = b-1$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, k-1$.\nTherefore, the digit-sum is:\n$$ s_b(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (b-1) $$\nThis is a sum of the constant value $(b-1)$ repeated $k$ times. The value of this sum is simply the product of the constant term and the number of terms:\n$$ s_b(n) = k \\times (b-1) $$\nThis is a closed-form expression for the digit-sum of $n = b^k - 1$ in base $b$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{k(b-1)}\n$$", "id": "3089136"}, {"introduction": "Moving from integers to rational numbers, we often observe that their radix expansions repeat, such as $\\frac{1}{3} = 0.333\\dots$ in base $10$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in number theory, well-posed, and objective. We shall proceed in three parts: first, a general explanation for the length of the repeating cycle of a rational number's radix expansion; second, an application of this theory to the fraction $1/37$ in base $10$; and third, a verification of the result via long division.\n\nPart 1: Explanation of the Cycle Length\n\nLet the rational number be $\\frac{a}{n}$, where $a, n$ are positive integers, and without loss of generality, we can assume $1 \\le a  n$ by subtracting the integer part. The problem specifies two conditions: $\\gcd(b, n) = 1$ and $\\gcd(a, n) = 1$. We want to find the digits $d_1, d_2, d_3, \\dots$ of the base-$b$ expansion, which is given by\n$$ \\frac{a}{n} = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} d_i b^{-i} = 0.d_1 d_2 d_3 \\dots_b $$\nThe digits $d_i$ are integers such that $0 \\le d_i  b$.\n\nThe long-division algorithm provides a procedure to find these digits.\nTo find the first digit, $d_1$, we multiply $\\frac{a}{n}$ by $b$:\n$$ \\frac{ab}{n} = d_1 + \\sum_{i=2}^{\\infty} d_i b^{-(i-1)} $$\nThe integer part of this expression is $d_1$, so $d_1 = \\lfloor \\frac{ab}{n} \\rfloor$. By the division algorithm, we can write $ab = d_1 n + r_1$, where $r_1$ is the remainder, satisfying $0 \\le r_1  n$. The sequence of digits is generated by the sequence of remainders.\n\nThe next step of the algorithm operates on the fractional part, which is $\\frac{r_1}{n}$. We multiply by $b$ again:\n$$ \\frac{r_1 b}{n} = d_2 + \\frac{r_2}{n} $$\nHere, $d_2 = \\lfloor \\frac{r_1 b}{n} \\rfloor$, and the division algorithm gives $r_1 b = d_2 n + r_2$ with $0 \\le r_2  n$.\n\nWe can generalize this process. Let $r_0 = a$. The $(i+1)$-th step of the algorithm is given by the recursive relation:\n$$ r_i b = d_{i+1} n + r_{i+1}, \\quad \\text{for } i \\ge 0 $$\nwhere $d_{i+1} = \\lfloor \\frac{r_i b}{n} \\rfloor$ is the $(i+1)$-th digit and $r_{i+1}$ is the $(i+1)$-th remainder, with $0 \\le r_{i+1}  n$.\n\nFrom the recurrence relation, we can express the remainders using modular arithmetic:\n$$ r_{i+1} \\equiv r_i b \\pmod{n} $$\nApplying this relation repeatedly, starting from $r_1 \\equiv r_0 b \\pmod{n} \\equiv ab \\pmod{n}$, we find:\n$$ r_i \\equiv r_{i-1}b \\equiv r_{i-2}b^2 \\equiv \\dots \\equiv r_0 b^i \\pmod{n} $$\nThus, for any $i \\ge 1$, the $i$-th remainder is given by $r_i \\equiv ab^i \\pmod{n}$.\n\nThe sequence of digits $d_1, d_2, \\dots$ repeats if and only if the sequence of remainders $r_1, r_2, \\dots$ repeats. Since each remainder $r_i$ must belong to the finite set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, the sequence must eventually repeat. Given $\\gcd(b, n)=1$ and $\\gcd(a, n)=1$, it can be shown that $r_i$ will never be $0$, so the expansion is non-terminating.\n\nLet the period of the expansion be $p$. This means that the sequence of remainders is periodic. For the expansion to be purely periodic (no non-repeating part), the sequence of remainders $r_1, r_2, \\dots$ must begin its cycle immediately. This requires the first repeated remainder to be $r_0=a$. Let us demonstrate this. Suppose the first repetition in the sequence of remainders $r_0, r_1, r_2, \\ldots$ is $r_k = r_j$ for some $0 \\le j  k$. From $r_i \\equiv r_{i-1}b \\pmod n$, we have $r_{j-1}b \\equiv r_j \\pmod n$ and $r_{k-1}b \\equiv r_k \\pmod n$. Since $r_j=r_k$, we deduce $r_{j-1}b \\equiv r_{k-1}b \\pmod n$. As $\\gcd(b,n)=1$, $b$ is invertible modulo $n$, so we can multiply by $b^{-1}$ to obtain $r_{j-1} \\equiv r_{k-1} \\pmod n$. Since both are valid remainders less than $n$, we have $r_{j-1}=r_{k-1}$. This backward induction can be repeated $j$ times, yielding $r_0 = r_{k-j}$. This shows that the first remainder to be repeated is indeed $r_0=a$.\n\nThe length of the repeating cycle, $k$, is therefore the smallest positive integer such that $r_k = r_0 = a$.\nUsing our modular arithmetic expression for the remainder, $r_k \\equiv ab^k \\pmod{n}$. The condition $r_k = a$ becomes:\n$$ ab^k \\equiv a \\pmod{n} $$\nThe problem states that $a$ and $n$ are coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(a,n)=1$. This implies that $a$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $n$. Multiplying the congruence by $a^{-1}$, we get:\n$$ b^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} $$\nThe length of the repeating cycle is the smallest positive integer $k$ for which this congruence holds. By definition, this $k$ is the multiplicative order of $b$ modulo $n$.\n\nPart 2: Application to $\\frac{1}{37}$ in Base $10$\n\nWe are asked to find the repeating period length of the base-$10$ expansion of $\\frac{1}{37}$.\nHere, $a=1$, $n=37$, and $b=10$. We verify the conditions:\n1. $\\gcd(a,n) = \\gcd(1,37) = 1$.\n2. $\\gcd(b,n) = \\gcd(10,37) = 1$, since $37$ is a prime number and does not divide $10$.\n\nThe conditions are satisfied. According to the reasoning above, the length of the repeating period is the multiplicative order of $10$ modulo $37$. We seek the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{37}$.\n\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, since $37$ is prime, we know $10^{36} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{37}$. Thus, the order $k$ must be a divisor of $36$. The divisors of $36$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36$. We test the smallest divisors first:\n- For $k=1$: $10^1 = 10 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{37}$.\n- For $k=2$: $10^2 = 100$. Since $100 = 2 \\times 37 + 26$, we have $10^2 \\equiv 26 \\pmod{37}$. This is not $1$.\n- For $k=3$: $10^3 = 10^2 \\times 10 \\equiv 26 \\times 10 = 260 \\pmod{37}$. To evaluate $260 \\pmod{37}$, we divide: $260 = 7 \\times 37 + 1$. Thus, $10^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{37}$.\n\nThe smallest positive integer $k$ for which $10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{37}$ is $3$. Therefore, the length of the repeating period of the base-$10$ expansion of $\\frac{1}{37}$ is $3$.\n\nPart 3: Verification by Long Division\n\nWe now perform the long division for $\\frac{1}{37}$ to explicitly find its base-$10$ expansion.\nLet $r_0 = a = 1$.\n1.  To find the first digit $d_1$, we compute $r_0 \\times 10 = 1 \\times 10 = 10$. Division by $37$ gives $10 = 0 \\times 37 + 10$. So, $d_1 = 0$ and the remainder is $r_1=10$.\n2.  To find $d_2$, we compute $r_1 \\times 10 = 10 \\times 10 = 100$. Division by $37$ gives $100 = 2 \\times 37 + 26$. So, $d_2 = 2$ and the remainder is $r_2=26$.\n3.  To find $d_3$, we compute $r_2 \\times 10 = 26 \\times 10 = 260$. Division by $37$ gives $260 = 7 \\times 37 + 1$. So, $d_3 = 7$ and the remainder is $r_3=1$.\n4.  At this point, the remainder is $r_3=1$, which is equal to our initial remainder $r_0=1$. The sequence of remainders $(10, 26, 1)$ has completed a cycle. The next iteration will use $r_3=1$ and produce the same digit and remainder as the first step ($d_4 = 0, r_4 = 10$), and so on.\n\nThe sequence of digits generated is $d_1, d_2, d_3 = 0, 2, 7$. This block of digits will repeat.\nThe expansion is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{37} = 0.027027027\\dots = 0.\\overline{027} $$\nThe repeating block is `027`, and its length is indeed $3$. This verifies the result obtained from modular arithmetic. The repeating period length is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3089118"}, {"introduction": "What if we allowed the base of a number system to be negative?

The division algorithm states that for any integers $a$ and $c$ with $c \\neq 0$, there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that $a = qc + r$ and $0 \\leq r  |c|$.\nLet us apply this to our base $b = -2$. For any integer $n_k$, we can write:\n$n_k = q (-2) + r$, where the remainder $r$ satisfies $0 \\leq r  |-2|=2$. Thus, $r$ must be in the set $\\{0, 1\\}$, which is our desired digit set.\nLet $n_0 = n$. We generate a sequence of quotients $n_k$ and remainders $d_k$ as follows:\n$n_0 = n_{1}(-2) + d_0$\n$n_1 = n_{2}(-2) + d_1$\n...\n$n_k = n_{k+1}(-2) + d_k$\n...\nwhere at each step $d_k \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. From this recurrence, we can write $n_k = d_k - 2n_{k+1}$.\n\nTo show this process generates a finite expansion, we must prove that the sequence of quotients $n_k$ eventually reaches $0$. Let's analyze the magnitude of the quotients. The next quotient $n_{k+1}$ is given by $n_{k+1} = (d_k - n_k)/2$.\n- If $n_k  0$, then $n_{k+1} = (d_k - n_k)/2 \\leq (1 - n_k)/2 \\leq 0$.\n- If $n_k  0$, then $n_{k+1} = (d_k - n_k)/2 \\geq (0 - n_k)/2 = -n_k/2  0$.\nThe quotients alternate in sign (or are zero). Let's examine their magnitudes.\n- If $|n_k|  1$, then $|n_{k+1}| = |(d_k - n_k)/2| \\leq (|d_k| + |n_k|)/2 \\leq (1 + |n_k|)/2$. Since $|n_k|  1$, we have $1  |n_k|$, which implies $1 + |n_k|  2|n_k|$, so $(1 + |n_k|)/2  |n_k|$. Thus, for $|n_k|  1$, the magnitude $|n_{k+1}|$ is strictly smaller than $|n_k|$.\n- The only cases where the magnitude might not strictly decrease are $|n_k| \\leq 1$, i.e., $n_k \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n  - If $n_k = 0$, the process terminates ($d_k=0, n_{k+1}=0$).\n  - If $n_k = 1$, then $1 = (-2) \\cdot 0 + 1$.

The next step will then be $n_{k+1}=1$, which we have just shown leads to termination.\nSince the magnitude of the non-zero quotients strictly decreases until it reaches $1$, the sequence of quotients must eventually become $0$. This guarantees that the process terminates for any integer $n$, establishing the existence of a finite base $-2$ expansion.\n\n**Uniqueness:**\nSuppose an integer $n$ has two different representations in base $-2$:\n$n = \\sum_{k=0}^{m} d_k (-2)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{m} c_k (-2)^k$, with $d_k, c_k \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.

By our assumption, $d_j \\neq c_j$, so $d_j - c_j$ must be either $1$ or $-1$.\nAn odd number ($1$ or $-1$) cannot be equal to an even number. This is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false, and there cannot be any index $j$ where the digits differ. Thus, $d_k = c_k$ for all $k$, and the representation is unique.\n\n**Part 2: Absence of a Sign Bit**\nThe constructive proof of existence provided above applies to any integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, whether it is positive, negative, or zero. The algorithm $n_{k+1}=(d_k-n_k)/2$ with $d_k=n_k \\pmod 2$ produces a valid, unique sequence of digits $\\{0,1\\}$ for any starting integer. This is in contrast to standard positive bases (like base $10$ or base $2$), where the standard division algorithm only produces representations for non-negative integers, necessitating an external symbol (a minus sign, '$-$') to represent negative numbers. In base $-2$, the sign is implicitly encoded within the sequence of digits itself.\n\n**Part 3: Base $-2$ Expansion of $n=137$**\nWe apply the algorithm $n_{k+1} = (d_k - n_k)/2$, where $d_k = n_k \\pmod 2$ (with remainder in $\\{0,1\\}$).\n$n_0 = 137$: $d_0 = 137 \\pmod 2 = 1$; $n_1 = (1 - 137)/2 = -68$.\n$n_1 = -68$: $d_1 = -68 \\pmod 2 = 0$; $n_2 = (0 - (-68))/2 = 34$.\n$n_2 = 34$: $d_2 = 34 \\pmod 2 = 0$; $n_3 = (0 - 34)/2 = -17$.\n$n_3 = -17$: $d_3 = -17 \\pmod 2 = 1$; $n_4 = (1 - (-17))/2 = 9$.\n$n_4 = 9$: $d_4 = 9 \\pmod 2 = 1$; $n_5 = (1 - 9)/2 = -4$.\n$n_5 = -4$: $d_5 = -4 \\pmod 2 = 0$; $n_6 = (0 - (-4))/2 = 2$.\n$n_6 = 2$: $d_6 = 2 \\pmod 2 = 0$; $n_7 = (0 - 2)/2 = -1$.\n$n_7 = -1$: $d_7 = -1 \\pmod 2 = 1$; $n_8 = (1 - (-1))/2 = 1$.\n$n_8 = 1$: $d_8 = 1 \\pmod 2 = 1$; $n_9 = (1 - 1)/2 = 0$.\nThe process terminates. The representation is formed by the digits from last to first: $(d_8 d_7 d_6 d_5 d_4 d_3 d_2 d_1 d_0)_{-2}$.\nSo, $137_{10} = 110011001_{(-2)}$.\nThe numeral $E$ is $110011001_{(-2)}$, so $\\mathrm{val}_{10}(E) = 137$.\n\n**Part 4: Arithmetic in Base $-2$**\nFor column-wise arithmetic, we need rules for handling carries. If the sum in a column is $S$, we write $S = d_{out} + (-2)c_{out}$, where $d_{out}$ is the digit for that column and $c_{out}$ is the carry to the next column.\n- $S=0: 0 = 0 + (-2) \\cdot 0 \\implies d_{out}=0, c_{out}=0$.\n- $S=1: 1 = 1 + (-2) \\cdot 0 \\implies d_{out}=1, c_{out}=0$.\n- $S=2: 2 = 0 + (-2) \\cdot (-1) \\implies d_{out}=0, c_{out}=-1$.\n- $S=-1: -1 = 1 + (-2) \\cdot 1 \\implies d_{out}=1, c_{out}=1$.\n- $S=3: 3 = 1 + (-2) \\cdot (-1) \\implies d_{out}=1, c_{out}=-1$.\n\n**Addition: $A = 10101_{(-2)} + 1101_{(-2)}$**\nWe align the numerals and add column by column from right to left (index $k=0$).\n```\n  Carries:   1  -1   1  -1\n             1  0  1  0  1\n           +   0  1  1  0  1\n--------------------------\n           1  0  1  1  0\n```\n- $k=0$: $1+1 = 2 \\implies$ sum is $0$, carry is $-1$.\n- $k=1$: $0+0+(-1) = -1 \\implies$ sum is $1$, carry is $1$.\n- $k=2$: $1+1+1 = 3 \\implies$ sum is $1$, carry is $-1$.\n- $k=3$: $0+1+(-1) = 0 \\implies$ sum is $0$, carry is $0$.\n- $k=4$: $1+0+0 = 1 \\implies$ sum is $1$, carry is $0$.\nSo, $A = 10110_{(-2)}$.\n\nVerification:\n$\\mathrm{val}_{10}(10101_{(-2)}) = 1(-2)^4 + 0(-2)^3 + 1(-2)^2 + 0(-2)^1 + 1(-2)^0 = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21$.\n$\\mathrm{val}_{10}(1101_{(-2)}) = 1(-2)^3 + 1(-2)^2 + 0(-2)^1 + 1(-2)^0 = -8 + 4 + 1 = -3$.\nThe sum is $21 + (-3) = 18$.\nThe result is $\\mathrm{val}_{10}(10110_{(-2)}) = 1(-2)^4 + 0(-2)^3 + 1(-2)^2 + 1(-2)^1 + 0(-2)^0 = 16 + 4 - 2 = 18$.\nThe calculation is correct. $\\mathrm{val}_{10}(A) = 18$.\n\n**Multiplication: $B = 1011_{(-2)} \\cdot 1001_{(-2)}$**\nWe use long multiplication.\n```\n          1  0  1  1\n        x 1  0  0  1\n-----------------\n          1  0  1  1   (1011 * 1)\n        0  0  0  0     (1011 * 0, shifted)\n      0  0  0  0       (1011 * 0, shifted)\n+   1  0  1  1         (1011 * 1, shifted)\n-----------------\n```\nWe now sum the partial products: $1011000_{(-2)} + 1011_{(-2)}$.\n```\n  Carries:    -1  0  0  -1\n             1  0  1  1  0  0  0\n           +      0  0  1  0  1  1\n--------------------------------\n           1  0  0  0  0  1  1\n```\n- $k=0: 0+1=1 \\implies$ sum $1$, carry $0$.\n- $k=1: 0+1=1 \\implies$ sum $1$, carry $0$.\n- $k=2: 0+0=0 \\implies$ sum $0$, carry $0$.\n- $k=3: 1+1=2 \\implies$ sum $0$, carry $-1$.\n- $k=4: 1+0+(-1)=0 \\implies$ sum $0$, carry $0$.\n- $k=5: 0+0+0=0 \\implies$ sum $0$, carry $0$.\n- $k=6: 1+0+0=1 \\implies$ sum $1$, carry $0$.\nSo, $B = 1000011_{(-2)}$.\n\nVerification:\n$\\mathrm{val}_{10}(1011_{(-2)}) = 1(-2)^3 + 0(-2)^2 + 1(-2)^1 + 1(-2)^0 = -8 - 2 + 1 = -9$.\n$\\mathrm{val}_{10}(1001_{(-2)}) = 1(-2)^3 + 0(-2)^2 + 0(-2)^1 + 1(-2)^0 = -8 + 1 = -7$.\nThe product is $(-9) \\cdot (-7) = 63$.\nThe result is $\\mathrm{val}_{10}(1000011_{(-2)}) = 1(-2)^6 + 1(-2)^1 + 1(-2)^0 = 64 - 2 + 1 = 63$.\nThe calculation is correct. $\\mathrm{val}_{10}(B) = 63$.\n\n**Part 5: Final Calculation of $S$**\nWe are asked to compute $S = \\mathrm{val}_{10}(A) + 2\\,\\mathrm{val}_{10}(B) + \\mathrm{val}_{10}(E)$.\nUsing the values derived above:\n- $\\mathrm{val}_{10}(A) = 18$\n- $\\mathrm{val}_{10}(B) = 63$\n- $\\mathrm{val}_{10}(E) = 137$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $S$:\n$S = 18 + 2(63) + 137$\n$S = 18 + 126 + 137$\n$S = 144 + 137$\n$S = 281$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{281}\n$$", "id": "3089124"}]}
