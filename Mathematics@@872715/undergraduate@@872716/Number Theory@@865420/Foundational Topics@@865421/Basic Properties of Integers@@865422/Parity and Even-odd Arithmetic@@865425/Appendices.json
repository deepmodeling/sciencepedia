The expression must be a closed-form function of $n$ using only the floor function and standard arithmetic operations.\n\nThe behavior of an integer expression modulo a number often depends on the input integer modulo some other number. Since the expression involves division by $2$, and we are interested in the parity of the result (another division by $2$), it is natural to investigate the properties of $T(n)$ based on the value of $n$ modulo $4$. This is also suggested by the hint to use the two lowest binary digits of $n$, as the value of $n$ modulo $4$ is uniquely determined by these two digits.

A solution would exist only if the compatibility condition $a \\equiv b \\pmod{\\gcd(2,m)}$, i.e., $a \\equiv b \\pmod{2}$, is satisfied.

For a solution to exist for $x^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{2^k}$ with $k \\ge 1$, it must also hold for the modulus $2$. The congruence becomes $x^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{2}$, which simplifies to $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.

Therefore, any solution $x$ to the congruence, for any $k \\ge 1$, must be an odd integer.\n\nWe now determine $N(k)$ by examining the congruence for successive values of $k$.\n\nCase $k=1$:\nThe congruence is $x^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{2}$, which is $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.

An algebraic justification is that any odd number $x$ can be written as $x=2m+1$ for some integer $m$. Then $x^2 = (2m+1)^2 = 4m^2+4m+1 = 4m(m+1)+1$. The product of two consecutive integers $m(m+1)$ is always even, so $m(m+1) = 2j$ for some integer $j$.

If a solution $x_0$ existed for this congruence, it would mean $x_0^2 - 5$ is a multiple of $2^k$. Since $k>3$, $2^k$ is a multiple of $2^3=8$. Therefore, if $x_0^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{2^k}$, it must also be true that $x_0^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$. However, as we have just proven, the congruence $x^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$ has no solutions. This leads to a contradiction.\nTherefore, no solutions exist for any $k > 3$. This implies $N(k)=0$ for all $k > 3$.\nCombining with the $k=3$ case, we have $N(k)=0$ for all $k \\ge 3$. This argument uses the principle of lifting, showing that a lack of solutions modulo $8$ prevents solutions modulo any higher power of $2$.\n\nTo summarize our findings for $N(k)$:\n$N(1) = 1$\n$N(2) = 2$\n$N(k) = 0$ for all integers $k \\ge 3$.\n\nThe parity of every existing solution is odd, as shown for $k=1$ and $k=2$.\n\nFinally, we compute the value of the series $S$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{N(k)}{2^k} = \\frac{N(1)}{2^1} + \\frac{N(2)}{2^2} + \\frac{N(3)}{2^3} + \\frac{N(4)}{2^4} + \\dots\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found for $N(k)$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{1}{2^1} + \\frac{2}{2^2} + \\frac{0}{2^3} + \\frac{0}{2^4} + \\dots\n$$\nAll terms for $k \\ge 3$ are zero.\n$$\nS = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n$$\nThe value of the series is $1$, which is a simplified rational number.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3087916"}]}
