An integer $p \\geq 2$ is called prime if its only positive divisors are $1$ and $p$. A pair of primes $\\left(p,q\\right)$ is a twin prime pair if $q-p=2$.

The solution proceeds in three parts as stipulated.\n\nFirst, we deduce that any prime $p>3$ must have a residue of $1$ or $5$ modulo $6$.\nLet $p$ be an integer such that $p > 3$. By the division algorithm, $p$ can be written in the form $p = 6k + r$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$ and a unique residue $r$ such that $0 \\le r \\le 5$. We examine each possible value of $r$:\n- If $r=0$, then $p = 6k = 2(3k)$. Since $p > 3$, we have $k \\ge 1$, which implies $3k > 1$. Thus, $p$ is divisible by $2$ and $3$. As its divisors are not only $1$ and $p$, it is not a prime number.\n- If $r=2$, then $p = 6k+2 = 2(3k+1)$. Since $p > 3$, we have $k \\ge 1$, which implies $3k+1 > 1$. Thus, $p$ is divisible by $2$. As its divisors are not only $1$ and $p$, it is not a prime number.\n- If $r=3$, then $p = 6k+3 = 3(2k+1)$. Since $p > 3$, we have $k \\ge 1$, which implies $2k+1 > 1$. Thus, $p$ is divisible by $3$. As its divisors are not only $1$ and $p$, it is not a prime number.\n- If $r=4$, then $p = 6k+4 = 2(3k+2)$. Since $p > 3$, we have $k \\ge 1$, which implies $3k+2 > 1$. Thus, $p$ is divisible by $2$. As its divisors are not only $1$ and $p$, it is not a prime number.\nThe only remaining possibilities for the residue $r$ are $r=1$ and $r=5$. Therefore, if $p$ is a prime number and $p>3$, it must satisfy $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$ or $p \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$.\n\nSecond, we verify that the given pairs are twin prime pairs using the definition of a prime and trial division by primes up to $\\sqrt{n}$.\n- For the pair $(3,5)$:\n  - $p=3$: The only positive divisors are $1$ and $3$, so $3$ is prime.\n  - $q=5$: For primality testing, we check for prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$.

We test the prime $2$. Since $7$ is not divisible by $2$, $7$ is prime.\n  - The difference is $7-5=2$, so $(5,7)$ is a twin prime pair.\n- For the pair $(11,13)$:\n  - $p=11$: We check for prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{11} \\approx 3.31$. We test primes $2$ and $3$. Since $11$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$, $11$ is prime.\n  - $q=13$: We check for prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{13} \\approx 3.60$. We test primes $2$ and $3$. Since $13$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$, $13$ is prime.\n  - The difference is $13-11=2$, so $(11,13)$ is a twin prime pair.\n- For the pair $(17,19)$:\n  - $p=17$: We check for prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.12$. We test primes $2$ and $3$. Since $17$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$, $17$ is prime.\n  - $q=19$: We check for prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.35$. We test primes $2$ and $3$. Since $19$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$, $19$ is prime.\n  - The difference is $19-17=2$, so $(17,19)$ is a twin prime pair.\n\nThird, we classify each prime in the ordered list $3, 5, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19$ by its least nonnegative residue modulo $6$ and construct the matrix $R$.\n- For $3$: $3 = 0 \\cdot 6 + 3 \\implies 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}$.

The methodology prescribed is to first find all unordered triples of odd primes $\\{p, q, r\\}$ that sum to $33$, and then to count the number of distinct ordered triples that can be formed from each unordered triple.\n\nAn odd prime is a prime number greater than $2$.

Thus, we only need to consider cases where $p$ is one of the odd primes $3, 5, 7,$ or $11$.\n\nFurthermore, since $p_1, p_2, p_3 \\ge 3$, the largest possible prime in any triple is bounded by $33 - 3 - 3 = 27$.
