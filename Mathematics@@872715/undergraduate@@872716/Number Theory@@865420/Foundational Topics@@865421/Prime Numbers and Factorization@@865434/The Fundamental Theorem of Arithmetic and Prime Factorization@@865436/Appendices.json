It presents standard definitions from number theory and asks for a proof of a fundamental result followed by its direct application. The problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. First, we must establish from first principles why, for a given integer $n \\geq 2$, it is sufficient to test for divisibility by integers up to $\\sqrt{n}$ to determine if $n$ is prime or composite. Second, we must apply this principle to find the unique prime factorization of the integer $n=8051$.\n\nPart 1: Proof of the Primality Test Bound\n\nLet $n \\geq 2$ be an integer. The problem requires us to determine if $n$ is prime or composite. According to the provided definition, if $n$ is composite, it can be written as a product $n = ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers satisfying $1  a  n$ and $1  b  n$.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let us arrange the factors such that $a \\leq b$.\nWe will now prove by contradiction that $a$ must be less than or equal to $\\sqrt{n}$. Let us assume the contrary, that is, $a  \\sqrt{n}$.\nSince we have established $a \\leq b$, our assumption $a  \\sqrt{n}$ implies that $b$ must also be greater than $\\sqrt{n}$.\nIf we multiply these two inequalities, $a  \\sqrt{n}$ and $b  \\sqrt{n}$, we obtain:\n$$ab  \\sqrt{n} \\cdot \\sqrt{n}$$\nSubstituting $n=ab$, we get:\n$$n  n$$\nThis is a logical contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that $a  \\sqrt{n}$ must be false.\nThis leads to the conclusion that the smaller factor, $a$, must satisfy the inequality $a \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.\nSo, if an integer $n$ is composite, it must have at least one divisor $a$ (other than $1$) such that $a \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, this divisor $a$ must itself have a prime factor $p$. Since $p$ is a factor of $a$, we have $p \\leq a$. Combining this with our derived result, we have $p \\leq a \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.\nThis means that any composite number $n$ must have a prime factor $p$ such that $p \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.\n\nConsequently, to determine if an integer $n$ is prime, we only need to test for divisibility by prime numbers up to $\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor$. If no such prime divisor is found, it means $n$ cannot be composite, and therefore, it must be prime. Testing divisibility by all integers up to $\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor$ is also sufficient, though less efficient.\n\nPart 2: Prime Factorization of $8051$\n\nWe are tasked with finding the unique prime factorization of $n = 8051$. We apply the principle established above.\n\nFirst, we calculate the square root of $8051$ to determine the upper bound for our divisibility tests.\n$$(\\sqrt{8051})^2 = 8051$$\nWe know that $89^2 = 7921$ and $90^2 = 8100$. Thus, $\\sqrt{8051}$ is between $89$ and $90$.\n$$\\lfloor\\sqrt{8051}\\rfloor = 89$$\nWe need to test for divisibility by prime numbers $p$ such that $p \\leq 89$. The list of these primes is:\n$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89$.\n\nWe proceed with trial division:\n- Divisibility by $2$: $8051$ is odd, so it is not divisible by $2$.\n- Divisibility by $3$: The sum of the digits is $8+0+5+1=14$, which is not divisible by $3$.

Not divisible by $43$.\n- Divisibility by $47$: $8051 = 47 \\times 171 + 14$. Not divisible by $47$.\n- Divisibility by $53$: $8051 = 53 \\times 151 + 48$. Not divisible by $53$.\n- Divisibility by $59$: $8051 = 59 \\times 136 + 27$. Not divisible by $59$.\n- Divisibility by $61$: $8051 = 61 \\times 131 + 60$. Not divisible by $61$.\n- Divisibility by $67$: $8051 = 67 \\times 120 + 11$. Not divisible by $67$.\n- Divisibility by $71$: $8051 = 71 \\times 113 + 28$. Not divisible by $71$.\n- Divisibility by $73$: $8051 = 73 \\times 110 + 21$. Not divisible by $73$.\n- Divisibility by $79$: $8051 = 79 \\times 101 + 72$. Not divisible by $79$.\n- Divisibility by $83$: $8051 \\div 83$. We perform the division: $8051 = 83 \\times 90 + 581$. And $581 = 83 \\times 7$. Thus, $8051 = 83 \\times 90 + 83 \\times 7 = 83 \\times (90+7) = 83 \\times 97$.\n\nWe have found a factorization: $8051 = 83 \\times 97$.\n\nNow we must justify that the factors $83$ and $97$ are prime, using the same principle.\n\nJustification of primality for $83$:\nWe need to test for prime divisors up to $\\lfloor\\sqrt{83}\\rfloor$.

Since $9^2 = 81$ and $10^2 = 100$, we have $\\lfloor\\sqrt{97}\\rfloor = 9$.\nThe primes to test are again $2, 3, 5, 7$.\n- $97$ is not divisible by $2$ (it is odd).\n- $9+7=16$, not divisible by $3$.\n- Does not end in $0$ or $5$, not divisible by $5$.\n- $97 = 7 \\times 13 + 6$, not divisible by $7$.\nSince $97$ has no prime factors less than or equal to its square root, $97$ is a prime number.\n\nBoth factors, $83$ and $97$, are prime.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is mathematically and logically sound, self-contained, and well-posed within the domain of number theory.\n\nLet $a$ and $b$ be two integers, not both zero. The greatest common divisor, $\\gcd(a, b)$, is the largest positive integer $d$ that divides both $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is based on the Division Algorithm, which states that for any integers $a$ and $b$ with $b  0$, there exist unique integers $q$ (quotient) and $r$ (remainder) such that $a = qb + r$ and $0 \\le r  b$.\n\nFirst, we establish why the repeated application of the division algorithm produces the greatest common divisor. Let $a$ and $b$ be two positive integers with $a  b$. A key property is that $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, r)$, where $r$ is the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$. To prove this, let $d = \\gcd(a, b)$. By definition, $d|a$ and $d|b$. From the division algorithm equation, $r = a - qb$. Since $d$ divides $a$ and $qb$, it must divide their difference, so $d|r$. Thus, $d$ is a common divisor of $b$ and $r$. Now, let $c = \\gcd(b, r)$. By definition, $c|b$ and $c|r$. From the equation $a = qb + r$, since $c$ divides $qb$ and $r$, it must divide their sum, so $c|a$. Thus, $c$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$. Since $d$ is the *greatest* common divisor of $a$ and $b$, we must have $c \\le d$. Similarly, since $c$ is the *greatest* common divisor of $b$ and $r$, and $d$ is a common divisor of $b$ and $r$, we must have $d \\le c$. Combining these, we get $c = d$, which proves $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, r)$.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm applies this property iteratively. Let $r_{-1} = a$ and $r_0 = b$. We generate a sequence of remainders:\n$$r_{-1} = q_1 r_0 + r_1, \\quad 0  r_1  r_0$$\n$$r_0 = q_2 r_1 + r_2, \\quad 0  r_2  r_1$$\n$$r_1 = q_3 r_2 + r_3, \\quad 0  r_3  r_2$$\n$$\\vdots$$\n$$r_{k-2} = q_k r_{k-1} + r_k, \\quad 0  r_k  r_{k-1}$$\n$$r_{k-1} = q_{k+1} r_k + 0$$\nThe sequence of remainders $r_0, r_1, r_2, \\ldots$ is a strictly decreasing sequence of non-negative integers: $b = r_0  r_1  r_2  \\cdots  r_k  0$. Such a sequence must be finite and must terminate, which occurs when a remainder of $0$ is reached. The last non-zero remainder in this sequence is $r_k$.\nFrom the property $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, r)$, we have:\n$$\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(r_{-1}, r_0) = \\gcd(r_0, r_1) = \\gcd(r_1, r_2) = \\cdots = \\gcd(r_{k-1}, r_k)$$\nThe last pair is $(r_k, 0)$. Since any integer divides $0$, the common divisors of $r_k$ and $0$ are just the divisors of $r_k$. The greatest positive divisor of $r_k$ is $r_k$ itself. Therefore, $\\gcd(r_k, 0) = r_k$. This establishes that the final non-zero remainder, $r_k$, is indeed $\\gcd(a, b)$.\n\nSecond, we explain why back-substitution yields a representation for Bézout's identity. Bézout's identity states that for integers $a$ and $b$, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + by = \\gcd(a, b)$. The Euclidean algorithm provides a constructive proof. We start from the second-to-last equation of the algorithm:\n$$r_{k-2} = q_k r_{k-1} + r_k$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the gcd, $r_k$, as a linear combination of the two preceding remainders, $r_{k-2}$ and $r_{k-1}$:\n$$r_k = r_{k-2} - q_k r_{k-1}$$\nThe equation directly above it is $r_{k-3} = q_{k-1} r_{k-2} + r_{k-1}$, which can be rearranged to $r_{k-1} = r_{k-3} - q_{k-1} r_{k-2}$. We substitute this expression for $r_{k-1}$ into the equation for $r_k$:\n$$r_k = r_{k-2} - q_k (r_{k-3} - q_{k-1} r_{k-2})$$\n$$r_k = (1 + q_k q_{k-1})r_{k-2} - (q_k)r_{k-3}$$\nNow, $r_k$ is expressed as a linear combination of $r_{k-2}$ and $r_{k-3}$. This process is repeated, working backwards (back-substituting) up the sequence of equations. At each step, a remainder $r_i$ is replaced with a linear combination of $r_{i-1}$ and $r_{i-2}$, until finally $r_k$ is expressed as a linear combination of the original numbers, $r_{-1}=a$ and $r_0=b$. This produces the integers $x$ and $y$ of Bézout's identity.\n\nNow, we apply this to compute $\\gcd(123456, 7890)$. Let $a = 123456$ and $b = 7890$.\n$1. \\quad 123456 = 15 \\cdot 7890 + 5106$\n$2. \\quad 7890 = 1 \\cdot 5106 + 2784$\n$3. \\quad 5106 = 1 \\cdot 2784 + 2322$\n$4. \\quad 2784 = 1 \\cdot 2322 + 462$\n$5. \\quad 2322 = 5 \\cdot 462 + 12$\n$6. \\quad 462 = 38 \\cdot 12 + 6$\n$7. \\quad 12 = 2 \\cdot 6 + 0$\nThe last non-zero remainder is $6$.

First, we establish that conjugation is a ring homomorphism, specifically that $\\overline{xy}=\\overline{x}\\overline{y}$.\nThe product $xy$ is:\n$$xy = (a+b\\sqrt{-5})(c+d\\sqrt{-5}) = (ac-5bd) + (ad+bc)\\sqrt{-5}$$\nIts conjugate is:\n$$\\overline{xy} = (ac-5bd) - (ad+bc)\\sqrt{-5}$$\nThe product of the conjugates is:\n$$\\overline{x}\\overline{y} = (a-b\\sqrt{-5})(c-d\\sqrt{-5}) = (ac-5bd) - (ad+bc)\\sqrt{-5}$$\nThus, we have confirmed that $\\overline{xy}=\\overline{x}\\overline{y}$.\n\nNow, using the definition $N(z)=z\\overline{z}$ and the property we just proved, we verify the multiplicativity of the norm:\n$$N(xy) = (xy)(\\overline{xy}) = (xy)(\\overline{x}\\overline{y})$$\nSince multiplication in $R$ (as a subring of $\\mathbb{C}$) is associative and commutative, we can reorder the terms:\n$$N(xy) = (x\\overline{x})(y\\overline{y}) = N(x)N(y)$$\nThis completes the verification.\n\nNext, we determine the units of $R$.

In this case, $a^2 + 5b^2 \\ge 5$, which cannot equal $1$.\nTherefore, we must have $b=0$. The equation simplifies to $a^2 = 1$. The only integer solutions for $a$ are $a=1$ and $a=-1$.\nThis gives two units:\n- For $a=1, b=0$, we have the unit $u_1 = 1+0\\sqrt{-5} = 1$.\n- For $a=-1, b=0$, we have the unit $u_2 = -1+0\\sqrt{-5} = -1$.\nThe set of units in $R$ is $\\{1, -1\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Distinct Factorizations of $6$ and Non-associates**\n\nWe are asked to exhibit two distinct factorizations of $6$ in $R$.\nThe first factorization is trivial, using integers:\n$$6 = 2 \\cdot 3$$\nThe second factorization is given as:\n$$6 = (1+\\sqrt{-5})(1-\\sqrt{-5})$$\nWe can verify this product: $(1+\\sqrt{-5})(1-\\sqrt{-5}) = 1^2 - (\\sqrt{-5})^2 = 1 - (-5) = 1+5 = 6$.\nAll four elements, $2$, $3$, $1+\\sqrt{-5}$, and $1-\\sqrt{-5}$, are members of $R$. For instance, $2 = 2+0\\sqrt{-5}$.\n\nNext, we must check that none of these four factors are associates of each other. Two elements $x, y \\in R$ are associates if $x=uy$ for some unit $u \\in R$. As we found, the units are $\\{1, -1\\}$. So, $x$ and $y$ are associates if and only if $x=\\pm y$.\nA useful property is that if $x$ and $y$ are associates, their norms must be equal: $N(x) = N(uy) = N(u)N(y) = 1 \\cdot N(y) = N(y)$. Let's compute the norms of the four factors:\n$N(2) = 2^2 + 5(0)^2 = 4$\n$N(3) = 3^2 + 5(0)^2 = 9$\n$N(1+\\sqrt{-5}) = 1^2 + 5(1)^2 = 6$\n$N(1-\\sqrt{-5}) = 1^2 + 5(-1)^2 = 6$\n\nSince $N(2)$, $N(3)$, and $N(1+\\sqrt{-5})$ are all different ($4 \\neq 9 \\neq 6$), the elements $2$, $3$, and $1+\\sqrt{-5}$ cannot be associates of each other. The only possibility for association is between $1+\\sqrt{-5}$ and $1-\\sqrt{-5}$, as they share the same norm. We check if they are associates directly:\nIs $1+\\sqrt{-5} = 1 \\cdot (1-\\sqrt{-5})$? This means $1+\\sqrt{-5}=1-\\sqrt{-5}$, which simplifies to $2\\sqrt{-5}=0$, a falsehood.\nIs $1+\\sqrt{-5} = -1 \\cdot (1-\\sqrt{-5})$? This means $1+\\sqrt{-5}=-1+\\sqrt{-5}$, which simplifies to $1=-1$, also a falsehood.\nTherefore, $1+\\sqrt{-5}$ and $1-\\sqrt{-5}$ are not associates. We have confirmed that none of the four factors are associates of each other.\n\n**Step 3: Proof of Irreducibility**\n\nAn element $p \\in R$ is irreducible if, for any factorization $p=xy$ with $x, y \\in R$, either $x$ or $y$ must be a unit. This is equivalent to stating that if $p=xy$, then either $N(x)=1$ or $N(y)=1$.\n\n- **Irreducibility of $2$**: Suppose $2=xy$ for some $x, y \\in R$. Taking the norm gives $N(2) = N(x)N(y)$. Since $N(2)=4$, we have $N(x)N(y) = 4$. As norms are non-negative integers, the possible pairs $(N(x), N(y))$ are $(1, 4)$, $(2, 2)$, and $(4, 1)$.\nIf $(N(x), N(y)) = (1, 4)$ or $(4, 1)$, then one of $x$ or $y$ is a unit.\nWe must investigate the case $(N(x), N(y)) = (2, 2)$. This requires finding an element $z = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in R$ such that $N(z)=2$, i.e., $a^2+5b^2=2$.\nIf $b \\neq 0$, then $b^2 \\ge 1$ and $5b^2 \\ge 5$, so $a^2+5b^2  2$.\nIf $b=0$, the equation becomes $a^2=2$. There is no integer $a$ satisfying this.\nThus, no element in $R$ has a norm of $2$. The case $(N(x), N(y)) = (2, 2)$ is impossible.\nAny factorization of $2$ must involve a unit. Therefore, $2$ is irreducible in $R$.\n\n- **Irreducibility of $3$**: Suppose $3=xy$. Then $N(3) = N(x)N(y)$, which is $9=N(x)N(y)$. The integer factor pairs of $9$ are $(1, 9)$, $(3, 3)$, and $(9, 1)$.\nThe cases $(1, 9)$ and $(9, 1)$ imply one factor is a unit.\nWe examine the case $(N(x), N(y)) = (3, 3)$. Does an element $z=a+b\\sqrt{-5}$ with $N(z)=3$ exist? The equation is $a^2+5b^2=3$.\nAgain, if $b \\neq 0$, then $5b^2 \\ge 5  3$.\nIf $b=0$, the equation is $a^2=3$, which has no integer solution for $a$.\nNo element in $R$ has a norm of $3$. So, any factorization of $3$ must involve a unit. Therefore, $3$ is irreducible in $R$.\n\n- **Irreducibility of $1+\\sqrt{-5}$ and $1-\\sqrt{-5}$**: Let $p = 1+\\sqrt{-5}$. Suppose $p=xy$. Then $N(p)=N(x)N(y)$. Since $N(p)=6$, we have $N(x)N(y)=6$. The integer factor pairs of $6$ are $(1, 6)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 2)$, and $(6, 1)$.\nThe cases $(1, 6)$ and $(6, 1)$ imply one factor is a unit.\nThe cases $(2, 3)$ and $(3, 2)$ would require elements with norms of $2$ and $3$ to exist. As we have just proven, no such elements exist in $R$.\nTherefore, any factorization of $1+\\sqrt{-5}$ must involve a unit. It is irreducible.\nThe same argument applies to $1-\\sqrt{-5}$, which also has a norm of $6$. It is also irreducible.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion that $R$ is not a UFD**\n\nA Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) is an integral domain in which every non-zero, non-unit element has a factorization into irreducible elements that is unique up to the order and association of factors.\nWe have found two factorizations of the element $6 \\in R$:\n$6 = 2 \\cdot 3$\n$6 = (1+\\sqrt{-5})(1-\\sqrt{-5})$\nIn Step 3, we proved that all four elements $2$, $3$, $1+\\sqrt{-5}$, and $1-\\sqrt{-5}$ are irreducible in $R$.\nFor these two factorizations to be considered the same in a UFD, the irreducible elements of the first factorization must be associates of the irreducible elements of the second factorization.\nLet's check this. Is $2$ an associate of either $1+\\sqrt{-5}$ or $1-\\sqrt{-5}$?\nIn Step 2, we showed that associates must have the same norm. We have $N(2)=4$ while $N(1+\\sqrt{-5})=N(1-\\sqrt{-5})=6$. Since $4 \\neq 6$, $2$ cannot be an associate of $1+\\sqrt{-5}$ or $1-\\sqrt{-5}$.\nSimilarly, $N(3)=9$. Since $9 \\neq 6$, $3$ cannot be an associate of $1+\\sqrt{-5}$ or $1-\\sqrt{-5}$.\nThe set of irreducible factors $\\{2, 3\\}$ from the first factorization is not equivalent (up to association) to the set of irreducible factors $\\{1+\\sqrt{-5}, 1-\\sqrt{-5}\\}$ from the second.\nThis demonstrates that the element $6$ has two genuinely distinct factorizations into irreducible elements in $R$. This violates the uniqueness condition for a UFD. Therefore, $R = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a Unique Factorization Domain.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the product of the norms of the four irreducible factors: $N(2) \\cdot N(3) \\cdot N(1+\\sqrt{-5}) \\cdot N(1-\\sqrt{-5})$.\nUsing the norms we calculated earlier:\n$N(2) = 4$\n$N(3) = 9$\n$N(1+\\sqrt{-5}) = 6$\n$N(1-\\sqrt{-5}) = 6$\nThe product is:\n$$4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 = 36 \\cdot 36 = 1296$$\nAlternatively, using the multiplicativity of the norm:\n$N(2)N(3) = N(2 \\cdot 3) = N(6) = 6^2+5(0)^2 = 36$.\n$N(1+\\sqrt{-5})N(1-\\sqrt{-5}) = N((1+\\sqrt{-5})(1-\\sqrt{-5})) = N(6) = 36$.\nThe desired product is $N(6) \\cdot N(6) = 36 \\cdot 36 = 1296$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1296}$$", "id": "3091215"}]}
