We compute the squares of all nonzero elements in the ring of integers modulo $13$, which is the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$.\n$1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n$2^2 = 4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$\n$3^2 = 9 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13}$\n$4^2 = 16 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$\n$5^2 = 25 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$\n$6^2 = 36 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{13}$\nFor the remaining values, we can use the identity $(p-x)^2 \\equiv (-x)^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{p}$.\n$7^2 \\equiv (13-6)^2 \\equiv 6^2 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{13}$\n$8^2 \\equiv (13-5)^2 \\equiv 5^2 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$\n$9^2 \\equiv (13-4)^2 \\equiv 4^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$\n$10^2 \\equiv (13-3)^2 \\equiv 3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13}$\n$11^2 \\equiv (13-2)^2 \\equiv 2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$\n$12^2 \\equiv (13-1)^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n\nThe set of distinct nonzero values obtained is the set of quadratic residues modulo $13$.\nLet $QR_{13}$ be this set.\n$QR_{13} = \\{1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12\\}$.\nThere are $|QR_{13}| = 6$ quadratic residues, which agrees with the theoretical result that there are $\\frac{p-1}{2} = \\frac{13-1}{2} = 6$ quadratic residues modulo a prime $p$.\n\n**Part 2: Justification from First Principles**\nThe problem requires justifying the values of the Legendre symbol based on foundational results. We use Euler's criterion, which states that for an odd prime $p$ and an integer $a$ not divisible by $p$, $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) \\equiv a^{(p-1)/2} \\pmod{p}$. The values of the Legendre symbol are restricted to $\\{-1, 1\\}$.\n\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer $a$ such that $p \\nmid a$, we have $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nWe can rewrite this as $a^{p-1}-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$. Factoring the left side gives:\n$(a^{(p-1)/2} - 1)(a^{(p-1)/2} + 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $p$ is a prime, this implies that either $p | (a^{(p-1)/2} - 1)$ or $p | (a^{(p-1)/2} + 1)$.\nThis means $a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ or $a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nCase 1: $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$.\nBy definition, there exists an integer $x$ with $p \\nmid x$ such that $x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression from Euler's criterion:\n$a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv (x^2)^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv x^{p-1} \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $p \\nmid x$, by Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nThus, if $a$ is a quadratic residue, $a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nAccording to Euler's criterion, $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Since the only possible values for the symbol are $1$ and $-1$, we must have $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) = 1$.\n\nCase 2: $a$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$.\nThe congruence $X^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ is a polynomial congruence of degree $\\frac{p-1}{2}$. By Lagrange's theorem, it can have at most $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ incongruent solutions modulo $p$.\nWe have already shown that all $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ quadratic residues are solutions to this congruence.\nTherefore, the solutions to $X^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ are precisely the quadratic residues.\nAny other nonzero integer $a$ modulo $p$ (i.e., a quadratic non-residue) cannot satisfy this congruence. It must therefore satisfy the only other possibility derived from Fermat's Little Theorem:\n$a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\nBy Euler's criterion, this means $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) = -1$.\nThis completes the justification.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of Legendre Symbols for p=13**\nUsing the definition of the Legendre symbol and the set of quadratic residues found in Part 1, we can determine the value of $\\left(\\frac{a}{13}\\right)$ for each $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$.\nThe quadratic residues are $QR_{13} = \\{1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12\\}$. For these values of $a$, $\\left(\\frac{a}{13}\\right) = 1$.\nThe quadratic non-residues are the remaining elements in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$:\n$QNR_{13} = \\{2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11\\}$. For these values of $a$, $\\left(\\frac{a}{13}\\right) = -1$.\n\nWe list the values in increasing order of $a$:\n- $\\left(\\frac{1}{13}\\right) = 1$ since $1 \\in QR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{2}{13}\\right) = -1$ since $2 \\in QNR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{3}{13}\\right) = 1$ since $3 \\in QR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{4}{13}\\right) = 1$ since $4 \\in QR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right) = -1$ since $5 \\in QNR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{6}{13}\\right) = -1$ since $6 \\in QNR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{7}{13}\\right) = -1$ since $7 \\in QNR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{8}{13}\\right) = -1$ since $8 \\in QNR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{9}{13}\\right) = 1$ since $9 \\in QR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{10}{13}\\right) = 1$ since $10 \\in QR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{11}{13}\\right) = -1$ since $11 \\in QNR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{12}{13}\\right) = 1$ since $12 \\in QR_{13}$.\n\nThese values are to be presented in a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3088796"}, {"introduction": "While direct computation is insightful, it becomes infeasible for large primes, which is where the true power of the Legendre symbol's properties comes into play.

The prime $p=101$ is indeed an odd prime. The integer $a=10$ is not divisible by $p=101$, so the symbol will be either $1$ or $-1$. The problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed with the calculation of $\\left(\\frac{10}{101}\\right)$.\n\nThe first property we will use is the multiplicativity of the Legendre symbol in its numerator.

The congruence $L \\equiv R \\pmod p$ implies that $p$ must divide $L-R$. The possible values for $L-R$ are $-2$, $0$, and $2$. Since $p$ is an odd prime, $p \\ge 3$, and thus $p$ cannot divide either $-2$ or $2$. The only possibility is that $L-R=0$, which implies $L=R$.

The elements of $S$ are all positive and less than $p$, so they are their own least positive remainders. We must count how many of these elements, of the form $2k$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, \\frac{p-1}{2}\\}$, are greater than $\\frac{p}{2}$.\nThe condition is $2k > \\frac{p}{2}$, which simplifies to $k > \\frac{p}{4}$.\nThe number $n$ is thus the count of integers $k$ in the range $\\frac{p}{4} < k \\le \\frac{p-1}{2}$.
