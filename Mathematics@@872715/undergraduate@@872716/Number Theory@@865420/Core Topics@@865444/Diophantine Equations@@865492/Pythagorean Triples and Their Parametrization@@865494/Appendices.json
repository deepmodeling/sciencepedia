It presents a structured exercise to derive and apply the parametrization of Pythagorean triples.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution is provided below.\n\n**Derivation of the Parametrization**\n\nA Pythagorean triple consists of positive integers $(a,b,c)$ such that $a^2+b^2=c^2$. Since $c$ must be a positive integer, $c \\neq 0$. Dividing the equation by $c^2$ yields:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{a}{c}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{b}{c}\\right)^2 = 1 $$\nThis shows that for any Pythagorean triple, the point $(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{a}{c}, \\frac{b}{c}\\right)$ is a point on the unit circle $x^2+y^2=1$ with rational coordinates.\n\nTo find all such rational points, we can use a geometric method. Consider a line passing through a fixed rational point on the circle, for instance $(-1,0)$, and another rational point $(x,y)$ on the circle. The slope of this line, which we denote by $t$, must be a rational number:\n$$ t = \\frac{y - 0}{x - (-1)} = \\frac{y}{x+1} $$\nThis gives a relationship $y = t(x+1)$. We substitute this into the equation of the circle $x^2+y^2=1$:\n$$ x^2 + (t(x+1))^2 = 1 $$\n$$ x^2 + t^2(x^2+2x+1) = 1 $$\n$$ (1+t^2)x^2 + 2t^2x + (t^2-1) = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $x$. We know one solution is $x=-1$, as the line passes through $(-1,0)$. Let the other solution be $x_1$. From Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is $x \\cdot x_1 = \\frac{c}{a}$, which in our equation is $(-1) \\cdot x = \\frac{t^2-1}{1+t^2}$. This gives the coordinate $x$ of the other intersection point:\n$$ x = \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $y$:\n$$ y = t(x+1) = t\\left(\\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} + 1\\right) = t\\left(\\frac{1-t^2+1+t^2}{1+t^2}\\right) = \\frac{2t}{1+t^2} $$\nSince $t$ is any rational number, we can write $t = \\frac{n}{m}$ for some integers $m,n$ with $m \\neq 0$. To obtain a primitive triple, we can assume that $m$ and $n$ are coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. Substituting $t=\\frac{n}{m}$:\n$$ x = \\frac{1-(n/m)^2}{1+(n/m)^2} = \\frac{(m^2-n^2)/m^2}{(m^2+n^2)/m^2} = \\frac{m^2-n^2}{m^2+n^2} $$\n$$ y = \\frac{2(n/m)}{1+(n/m)^2} = \\frac{2n/m}{(m^2+n^2)/m^2} = \\frac{2mn}{m^2+n^2} $$\nComparing $(x,y)$ with $(\\frac{a}{c}, \\frac{b}{c})$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{m^2-n^2}{m^2+n^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{2mn}{m^2+n^2} $$\nThis leads to the general form of Pythagorean triples:\n$$ a = k(m^2-n^2), \\quad b = k(2mn), \\quad c = k(m^2+n^2) $$\nwhere $k$ is a rational number that makes $a,b,c$ integers. For primitive triples, where $\\gcd(a,b,c)=1$, we must find the conditions on $m$ and $n$ for the fraction $\\frac{m^2-n^2}{m^2+n^2}$ to be in lowest terms, and this suggests taking $k=1$.\n\nFor $a,b,c$ to be positive integers, we need $m^2-n^2>0$, so $m>n$, and since we can choose their signs, we take $m>n>0$. Let's analyze $\\gcd(m^2-n^2, m^2+n^2)$ assuming $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. Let $d = \\gcd(m^2-n^2, m^2+n^2)$. Then $d$ must divide their sum, $(m^2-n^2)+(m^2+n^2) = 2m^2$, and their difference, $(m^2+n^2)-(m^2-n^2)=2n^2$. Thus, $d | \\gcd(2m^2, 2n^2) = 2\\gcd(m^2, n^2)$. Since $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, it follows that $\\gcd(m^2,n^2)=1$, so $d|2$. This means $d$ can only be $1$ or $2$.\nIf $m$ and $n$ have opposite parity (one is even, one is odd), then $m^2$ is odd and $n^2$ is even (or vice-versa). In this case, $m^2-n^2$ and $m^2+n^2$ are both odd, so their gcd, $d$, cannot be $2$. Thus $d=1$.\nIf both $m$ and $n$ were odd, then $m^2-n^2$ and $m^2+n^2$ would both be even, so $d=2$. This would produce a non-primitive triple $(a,b,c)$ where all components are even.\nTherefore, to generate primitive Pythagorean triples, we must have $m, n$ be coprime integers of opposite parity, with $m>n>0$. The parametrization is:\n$$ a = m^2-n^2, \\quad b = 2mn, \\quad c = m^2+n^2 $$\n\n**Application to $(m,n)=(11,6)$**\n\nThe problem specifies the pair $(m,n)=(11,6)$. We check the conditions for generating a primitive triple:\n- $m>n>0$: $11 > 6 > 0$ is true.\n- $\\gcd(m,n)=1$: $\\gcd(11,6)=1$ is true.\n- $m,n$ have opposite parity: $11$ is odd and $6$ is even. This is true.\nThe conditions are satisfied.\n\n- **Construct the triple $(a,b,c)$**\nUsing the derived formulas:\n$$ a = m^2 - n^2 = 11^2 - 6^2 = 121 - 36 = 85 $$\n$$ b = 2mn = 2(11)(6) = 132 $$\n$$ c = m^2 + n^2 = 11^2 + 6^2 = 121 + 36 = 157 $$\nThe constructed triple is $(85, 132, 157)$.\n\n- **Confirm the triple and verify $a^2+b^2=c^2$**\nThe constructed triple $(85, 132, 157)$ matches the one provided in the problem statement for confirmation. We now verify the Pythagorean property:\n$$ a^2 = 85^2 = 7225 $$\n$$ b^2 = 132^2 = 17424 $$\n$$ c^2 = 157^2 = 24649 $$\nNow we check the sum:\n$$ a^2+b^2 = 7225 + 17424 = 24649 $$\nSince $a^2+b^2=c^2$, the triple $(85, 132, 157)$ is indeed a Pythagorean triple.\n\n- **Verify primitivity**\nWe need to establish that $\\gcd(a,b,c)=1$. It is sufficient to show that $\\gcd(a,b)=1$.\nThe prime factorization of $a=85$ is $5 \\times 17$.\nThe prime factorization of $b=132$ is $2 \\times 66 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 11$.\nThe sets of prime factors $\\{5, 17\\}$ and $\\{2, 3, 11\\}$ are disjoint. Therefore, $\\gcd(85, 132) = 1$.\nSince any common divisor of $(a,b,c)$ must also be a common divisor of $(a,b)$, and their greatest common divisor is $1$, it follows that $\\gcd(a,b,c)=1$. The triple is primitive.\n\n- **Check parity conditions**\nThe generating integers are $m=11$ (odd) and $n=6$ (even), which are of opposite parity as required by the theory for primitive triples.\nThe legs of the resulting triple are $a=85$ (odd) and $b=132$ (even). This is consistent with the formulas: $a=m^2-n^2$ is a difference of an odd square and an even square, which is always odd. $b=2mn$ contains a factor of $2$, and is therefore always even. The parity check is successful.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the single numerical value of $a+b+c$.\n$$ a+b+c = 85 + 132 + 157 $$\n$$ a+b+c = 217 + 157 = 374 $$\nThe sum of the components of the triple is $374$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{374}$$", "id": "3088884"}, {"introduction": "Once you are comfortable generating triples, a deeper level of understanding comes from working in reverse.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in number theory, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. We will first deduce the structural relations for primitive Pythagorean triples and then apply them to the specific case provided.\n\nA Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers $(a,b,c)$ such that $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$. A triple is called primitive if $\\gcd(a,b,c)=1$.\n\nFirst, we establish some properties of a primitive Pythagorean triple $(a,b,c)$. If a prime $p$ were to divide both $a$ and $b$, so $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ and $b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, then $a^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$ and $b^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$. This would imply $c^2 = a^2+b^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$, which means $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$. If $p$ divides $a$, $b$, and $c$, this contradicts the condition $\\gcd(a,b,c)=1$. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ must be coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(a,b)=1$. A similar argument shows that $\\gcd(a,c)=1$ and $\\gcd(b,c)=1$. Thus, the integers in a primitive Pythagorean triple are pairwise coprime.\n\nNext, we analyze the parity of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n1. Can both $a$ and $b$ be even? If $a$ and $b$ were both even, then $\\gcd(a,b) \\ge 2$, which contradicts the pairwise coprime property we just proved.\n2. Can both $a$ and $b$ be odd? If $a$ is odd, $a = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$, then $a^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2+4k+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Similarly, if $b$ is odd, $b^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Then $c^2 = a^2+b^2 \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$. However, the square of any integer is either $0 \\pmod{4}$ (if the integer is even) or $1 \\pmod{4}$ (if the integer is odd). There is no integer whose square is congruent to $2 \\pmod{4}$. Thus, $a$ and $b$ cannot both be odd.\nFrom these two points, we conclude that one of $a$ or $b$ must be even, and the other must be odd.\nIf one leg is odd and the other is even, then $c^2 = (\\text{odd})^2 + (\\text{even})^2 = \\text{odd} + \\text{even} = \\text{odd}$. This implies that $c$ must be odd.\nSo, for any primitive Pythagorean triple, one leg is odd, one leg is even, and the hypotenuse is odd.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let $a$ be the odd leg and $b$ be the even leg. The equation $a^2+b^2=c^2$ can be rearranged as:\n$$b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = (c-a)(c+a)$$\nSince $a$ and $c$ are both odd, their difference $c-a$ and their sum $c+a$ are both even. We can write $c-a=2u$ and $c+a=2v$ for some positive integers $u$ and $v$.\nSubstituting these into the equation for $b^2$:\n$$b^2 = (2u)(2v) = 4uv$$\nSince $b$ is even, we can write $b=2k$, so $b^2=4k^2$. This gives $4k^2 = 4uv$, or $k^2 = uv$. This is equivalent to:\n$$(\\frac{b}{2})^2 = uv$$\nNow we examine $u$ and $v$. We have $u = \\frac{c-a}{2}$ and $v = \\frac{c+a}{2}$. Their sum is $u+v = \\frac{c-a}{2} + \\frac{c+a}{2} = \\frac{2c}{2} = c$. Their difference is $v-u = \\frac{c+a}{2} - \\frac{c-a}{2} = \\frac{2a}{2} = a$.\nLet's find the greatest common divisor of $u$ and $v$. Any common divisor of $u$ and $v$ must also divide their sum $u+v=c$ and their difference $v-u=a$. So, $\\gcd(u,v)$ must divide $\\gcd(a,c)$. Since the triple is primitive, we established that $\\gcd(a,c)=1$. Therefore, $\\gcd(u,v)=1$.\nWe have two coprime integers, $u$ and $v$, whose product $uv$ is a perfect square. For this to be true, both $u$ and $v$ must themselves be perfect squares.\nLet $u = n^2$ and $v = m^2$ for some positive integers $m$ and $n$.\nSince $c$ and $a$ are positive, $v>u>0$, which implies $m^2 > n^2 > 0$, so $m > n > 0$.\nNow we can express $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $m$ and $n$:\n$a = v-u = m^2 - n^2$\n$c = v+u = m^2 + n^2$\nFrom $(\\frac{b}{2})^2 = uv = m^2 n^2$, we get $\\frac{b}{2}=mn$, which gives $b=2mn$.\n\nThe conditions for the resulting triple $(a,b,c)$ to be primitive are derived from the properties of $m$ and $n$.\n1.  $m > n > 0$ are positive integers.\n2.  $\\gcd(u,v) = \\gcd(n^2,m^2) = 1$, which implies $\\gcd(m,n)=1$.\n3.  $a = m^2-n^2$ must be odd. This occurs if one of $m^2, n^2$ is odd and the other is even. This, in turn, requires that one of $m, n$ is odd and the other is even. They must have opposite parity.\n\nSo, the structural relations are $a=m^2-n^2$, $b=2mn$, $c=m^2+n^2$, where $m,n$ are coprime integers of opposite parity with $m>n>0$.\n\nNow, we apply this to the primitive triple $(20,21,29)$.
