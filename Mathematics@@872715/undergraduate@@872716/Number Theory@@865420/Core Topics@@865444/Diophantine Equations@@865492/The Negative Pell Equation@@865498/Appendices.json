The premise about squares modulo $4$ is a fundamental fact.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated, with all necessary information provided to derive a set of correct conclusions. The constraints on $D$ are appropriate.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is phrased using precise, objective mathematical language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A full derivation and evaluation of the options will be performed.\n\n### Derivation\nThe given equation is $x^2 - Dy^2 = -1$. We are instructed to analyze this equation using congruences modulo $4$.\nThe equation can be written as a congruence:\n$$x^2 - Dy^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}$$\nSince $-1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the congruence is:\n$$x^2 - Dy^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\n\nThe problem states, and it is a basic fact, that the square of any integer $n$ is congruent to either $0$ or $1$ modulo $4$.\n-   If $n$ is even, $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $n$ is odd, $n = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Then $n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nSo, for any integer solution $(x, y)$, we must have $x^2 \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\pmod{4}$ and $y^2 \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\pmod{4}$.\n\nWe analyze the four possible cases for the residue of $D$ modulo $4$.\n\n**Case 1: $D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$**\nThe congruence becomes $x^2 - (0) y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, which simplifies to:\n$$x^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\nThis is impossible, as an integer square can only be congruent to $0$ or $1$ modulo $4$. Therefore, for $D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, the equation $x^2 - Dy^2 = -1$ has no integer solutions.\n\n**Case 2: $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$**\nThe congruence becomes:\n$$x^2 - y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\nWe examine the possibilities for $x^2 \\pmod{4}$ and $y^2 \\pmod{4}$:\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 0$ and $y^2 \\equiv 0$: $0 - 0 = 0 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 0$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1$: $0 - 1 = -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. This is a valid possibility.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 1$ and $y^2 \\equiv 0$: $1 - 0 = 1 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 1$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1$: $1 - 1 = 0 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe only combination that satisfies the congruence is $x^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. This implies that $x$ must be even and $y$ must be odd. Therefore, if a solution exists for $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, it must have this parity.\n\n**Case 3: $D \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$**\nThe congruence becomes:\n$$x^2 - 2y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\nWe examine the possibilities:\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 0$ and $y^2 \\equiv 0$: $0 - 2(0) = 0 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 0$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1$: $0 - 2(1) = -2 \\equiv 2 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 1$ and $y^2 \\equiv 0$: $1 - 2(0) = 1 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 1$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1$: $1 - 2(1) = -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. This is a valid possibility.\nThe only combination that satisfies the congruence is $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. This implies that $x$ must be odd and $y$ must be odd. Therefore, if a solution exists for $D \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, it must have this parity.\n\n**Case 4: $D \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$**\nThe congruence becomes:\n$$x^2 - 3y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\nSince $-3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, this is equivalent to:\n$$x^2 + y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\nWe examine the possibilities for the sum of two squares modulo $4$:\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 0$ and $y^2 \\equiv 0$: $0 + 0 = 0 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 0$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1$: $0 + 1 = 1 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 1$ and $y^2 \\equiv 0$: $1 + 0 = 1 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 1$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1$: $1 + 1 = 2 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\nNone of the combinations satisfy the congruence. The sum of two squares modulo $4$ can only result in $0$, $1$, or $2$. It can never be $3$. Therefore, for $D \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the equation $x^2 - Dy^2 = -1$ has no integer solutions.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

In formal logic, a statement of the form \"for all items in an empty set, property P is true\" is considered vacuously true. However, the problem seeks to determine necessary properties *about the parity or non-existence* of solutions. The fundamental discovery in this case is the non-existence of solutions, as stated in option E. Statement D, while vacuously true, provides no actual information about the parity of any solution and is a logical artifact of the set of solutions being empty. The direct and meaningful conclusion from the number-theoretic analysis is non-existence.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.

The methodology is prescribed: using the simple continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{29}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{29}$.

Assume $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and let $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ be odd with $a^2 - Db^2 = -4$. Then $u = \\frac{a + b\\sqrt{D}}{2} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ because $a \\equiv b \\pmod{2}$. Its norm is\n$$\nN_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(u) \\;=\\; \\frac{a^2 - Db^2}{4} \\;=\\; \\frac{-4}{4} \\;=\\; -1,\n$$\nso $u$ is a unit of norm $-1$.\n\nWe now show $u^3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{D}]$ and has norm $-1$, hence corresponds to an integral solution to the negative Pell equation. Compute\n$$\nu^3 \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{a + b\\sqrt{D}}{2}\\right)^3 \\;=\\; \\frac{(a + b\\sqrt{D})^3}{8}\n\\;=\\; \\frac{a^3 + 3 a^2 b \\sqrt{D} + 3 ab^2 D + b^3 D \\sqrt{D}}{8}.\n$$\nThus\n$$\nu^3 \\;=\\; \\frac{a^3 + 3 aDb^2}{8} \\;+\\; \\frac{3 a^2 b + Db^3}{8}\\,\\sqrt{D}.\n$$\nUse the relation $a^2 - Db^2 = -4$, i.e., $Db^2 = a^2 + 4$, to show both numerators are divisible by $8$:\n- Real part numerator:\n$$\na^3 + 3aDb^2 \\;=\\; a^3 + 3a(a^2 + 4) \\;=\\; 4a(a^2 + 3).\n$$\nSince $a$ is odd, $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$, hence $a^2 + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, and $4a(a^2 + 3)$ is divisible by $16$ in particular by $8$.\n\n- $\\sqrt{D}$-part numerator:\n$$\n3a^2b + Db^3 \\;=\\; b(3a^2 + Db^2) \\;=\\; b(3a^2 + a^2 + 4) \\;=\\; 4b(a^2 + 1).\n$$\nAgain $a$ odd implies $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, so $a^2 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, and $4b(a^2 + 1)$ is divisible by $8$.\n\nTherefore there exist integers $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that\n$$\nu^3 \\;=\\; x + y \\sqrt{D}.\n$$\nTaking norms gives\n$$\nN_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(u^3) \\;=\\; \\bigl(N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(u)\\bigr)^3 \\;=\\; (-1)^3 \\;=\\; -1.\n$$\nBut $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(x + y \\sqrt{D}) = x^2 - Dy^2$, hence\n$$\nx^2 - Dy^2 \\;=\\; -1,\n$$\nso $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ solve the negative Pell equation. This proves the claim in part $1$.\n\nStep $2$: Explicit examples.\n\nCase $D = 5$. Here $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}\\!\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right]$. Take $a = 1$, $b = 1$; then $a^2 - Db^2 = 1 - 5 = -4$. Thus\n$$\nu_5 \\;=\\; \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n$$\nis a half-integral unit of norm $-1$. Compute\n$$\nu_5^3 \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^3 \\;=\\; \\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{5})^3}{8}\n\\;=\\; \\frac{1 + 3\\sqrt{5} + 3 \\cdot 5 + 5 \\sqrt{5}}{8}\n\\;=\\; \\frac{16 + 8 \\sqrt{5}}{8} \\;=\\; 2 + \\sqrt{5}.\n$$\nThus $x_5 = 2$, $y_5 = 1$, and indeed $2^2 - 5 \\cdot 1^2 = 4 - 5 = -1$.\n\nCase $D = 13$. Here $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}\\!\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right]$. Take $a = 3$, $b = 1$; then $a^2 - Db^2 = 9 - 13 = -4$. Thus\n$$\nu_{13} \\;=\\; \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}\n$$\nis a half-integral unit of norm $-1$. Compute\n$$\nu_{13}^3 \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{3 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right)^3 \\;=\\; \\frac{(3 + \\sqrt{13})^3}{8}.\n$$\nNow $(3 + \\sqrt{13})^2 = 22 + 6 \\sqrt{13}$, so\n$$\n(3 + \\sqrt{13})^3 \\;=\\; (22 + 6 \\sqrt{13})(3 + \\sqrt{13}) \\;=\\; 144 + 40 \\sqrt{13}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\nu_{13}^3 \\;=\\; \\frac{144 + 40 \\sqrt{13}}{8} \\;=\\; 18 + 5 \\sqrt{13}.\n$$\nThus $x_{13} = 18$, $y_{13} = 5$, and indeed $18^2 - 13 \\cdot 5^2 = 324 - 325 = -1$.\n\nFinally, the requested sum is\n$$\nx_5 + x_{13} \\;=\\; 2 + 18 \\;=\\; 20.\n$$\nNo rounding is needed since this value is exact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "3092533"}]}
