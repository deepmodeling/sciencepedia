The overarching goal is to select a numerical quantity that, under any transformation producing a new nontrivial solution of the same form, strictly decreases and thus cannot descend indefinitely. Identify which of the following choices is a suitable measure for descent and justify why it is well-founded for this case.\n\nA. The measure is $x + y$, because the sum of the two bases of the associated right triangle derived from $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$ strictly decreases under descent, and any strictly decreasing sequence of such sums must terminate.\n\nB. The measure is the hypotenuse $Z = z^2$ of the associated Pythagorean triple obtained by setting $X = x^2$, $Y = y^2$, and $Z = z^2$, and it is well-founded since a strictly decreasing sequence in the positive integers cannot be infinite.\n\nC. The measure is the greatest common divisor $\\gcd(x,y,z)$ (greatest common divisor), because under descent the common divisors of $x$, $y$, and $z$ strictly decrease and eventually reach $1$.\n\nD. The measure is the ratio $x / y$, because by the Archimedean property of the real numbers the sequence of ratios must eventually terminate when it decreases strictly at each step.\n\nSelect the correct option and provide a rationale grounded in first principles of number theory, including ordering properties of the positive integers and structural facts about integer solutions to $X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2$.", "solution": "Option B is correct. The proof by infinite descent for the $n=4$ case proceeds by showing that the more general equation $a^4 + b^4 = c^2$ has no solutions in positive integers. The method assumes a \"minimal\" solution exists, where minimality is defined by the positive integer value of $c$. The core of the proof is to show that any such solution can be used to construct a new solution $(u,v,w)$ of the same form ($u^4+v^4=w^2$) where the new hypotenuse term $w$ is strictly smaller than $c$. This would generate an infinite, strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers ($c  w  \\dots$), which is impossible by the Well-Ordering Principle of integers.\n\nWhen applying this to the equation $x^4+y^4=z^4$, we rewrite it as $(x^2)^2+(y^2)^2=(z^2)^2$. This fits the form $a^4+b^4=c^2$ if we consider the solution to be $(x, y, z^2)$. The quantity that must decrease is the hypotenuse term, which in this case is $Z=z^2$. Therefore, $Z=z^2$ is the correct and well-founded measure for the descent.\n\n- Option A is incorrect because the descent is not guaranteed to decrease the sum of the bases, $x+y$.\n- Option C is incorrect because the proof begins by reducing to a primitive solution where $\\gcd(x,y,z)=1$. The gcd remains 1 throughout the descent; it does not decrease.\n- Option D is incorrect because the Well-Ordering Principle applies to positive integers, not rational numbers.

In the context of Diophantine equations, this often means working with \"primitive\" solutions where common factors have been eliminated. This practice explores the logical link between assuming a \"minimal\" solution and proving it must be primitive, a vital step that unlocks the use of Euclid's powerful parametrization formula for Pythagorean triples [@problem_id:3085260].", "problem": "Consider the argument by infinite descent for the case $n=4$ of Fermat's Last Theorem, which proceeds by showing there are no nonzero integers $x$, $y$, $z$ satisfying $x^4 + y^4 = z^2$. A standard starting point is to set $X = x^2$ and $Y = y^2$, so that one has a Pythagorean triple $(X,Y,z)$ with $X^2 + Y^2 = z^2$. Define the descent measure by $M(x,y,z) = z$. The following foundational items are available for use:\n- The definition of greatest common divisor: for integers $a$, $b$, $c$, the greatest common divisor $\\gcd(a,b,c)$ is the largest positive integer dividing each of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n- A triple $(u,v,w)$ of nonzero integers satisfying $u^2 + v^2 = w^2$ is called primitive if $\\gcd(u,v,w) = 1$.\n- Classification of primitive Pythagorean triples: if $(u,v,w)$ is primitive with $u^2 + v^2 = w^2$, then there exist coprime integers $mn0$ of opposite parity such that, up to order of $u$ and $v$, $u = m^2 - n^2$, $v = 2mn$, and $w = m^2 + n^2$.\n- The principle of infinite descent: if there exists a positive integer $N$ with a property and one can derive a strictly smaller positive integer with the same property, then no such $N$ can exist.\n\nIn this setting, one begins with a nontrivial solution $(x,y,z)$ of $x^4 + y^4 = z^2$ and considers $(X,Y,z)$ with $X = x^2$ and $Y = y^2$. To apply the classification of primitive Pythagorean triples, one typically removes common factors from $(X,Y,z)$ to obtain a primitive triple. Which statement best describes how this removal of common factors interacts with the descent measure $M$ and why it is essential to the overall descent?\n\nA. If $\\gcd(X,Y,z)  1$, dividing $(X,Y,z)$ by this common divisor produces a new triple $(X',Y',z')$ with $X'^2 + Y'^2 = z'^2$ and $z' = z/\\gcd(X,Y,z)  z$, so $M$ strictly decreases. Therefore, under a minimality hypothesis on $z$, the triple $(X,Y,z)$ must be primitive, which is necessary to invoke the primitive Pythagorean classification and to construct a subsequent smaller $z$ that contradicts minimality.\n\nB. Removing common factors can increase $M$ because the passage from squares to square roots changes scale in a way that may amplify $z$, so the descent must avoid normalization to preserve minimality.\n\nC. Removing common factors is not required; the classification of Pythagorean triples applies equally to non-primitive triples, and the descent can proceed without affecting $M$.\n\nD. To preserve minimality, one should redefine the descent measure as $M = \\dfrac{z}{\\gcd(x,y)}$, ensuring that removing common factors leaves $M$ unchanged and avoids interfering with the descent step.", "solution": "Option A provides the correct logical framework. The proof by infinite descent starts by assuming a solution $(x,y,z)$ exists for which the measure $M=z$ is the smallest possible positive integer. This is the minimality hypothesis.\n\nThe argument proceeds as follows:\n1.  Assume a minimal solution $(x,y,z)$ exists.\n2.  We must show that this minimal solution corresponds to a *primitive* Pythagorean triple $(x^2, y^2, z)$.\n3.  If we suppose the solution is not primitive, we can show this leads to a contradiction of minimality. If $g = \\gcd(x,y)  1$, then $g^4$ divides $x^4+y^4=z^2$, which implies $g^2$ must divide $z$. We can then construct a new integer solution $(x',y',z') = (x/g, y/g, z/g^2)$ to the original equation $x'^4+y'^4=z'^2$. The new measure $z' = z/g^2$ is strictly smaller than $z$, which contradicts the assumption that $z$ was minimal.\n4.  Therefore, the minimal solution must have $\\gcd(x,y)=1$. This in turn implies that the Pythagorean triple $(x^2, y^2, z)$ is primitive.\n5.  This conclusion is essential because the standard parametrization formula for Pythagorean triples, which is the engine of the subsequent descent, is only guaranteed to apply to *primitive* triples.\n\nOption A correctly captures this preliminary contradiction: if the triple were not primitive, we could immediately find a smaller solution, so the minimal solution must be primitive.

Thus\n$$x^2=m^2-n^2=r^4-4s^4=(r^2-2s^2)(r^2+2s^2),$$\nand one checks $\\gcd(r^2-2s^2,r^2+2s^2)=1$, so both factors are themselves perfect squares:\n$$r^2-2s^2=c^2,\\quad r^2+2s^2=d^2,$$\nwith $dc$ and $d^2-c^2=4s^2$.
