We are asked to evaluate this sum using fundamental principles and interpret the result.\n\nWe shall approach this problem in two ways: first, by direct computation based on the provided definitions, and second, by employing the more general framework of Dirichlet convolution to reveal the underlying structure and provide the requested interpretation.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Computation**\n\nFirst, we identify the components of the sum for the specific case $n=81$.\n\nThe number $n=81$ has the unique prime factorization $81 = 3^4$, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. The positive divisors $d$ of $81$ are the integers of the form $3^k$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. Thus, the set of divisors is $\\{1, 3, 9, 27, 81\\}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each of these divisors:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $d=1$: By definition, $\\mu(1) = 1$.\n    \\item For $d=3$: Since $3$ is a product of $k=1$ distinct primes, $\\mu(3) = (-1)^1 = -1$.\n    \\item For $d=9=3^2$: Since $9$ is divisible by the square of the prime $3$, $\\mu(9)=0$.\n    \\item For $d=27=3^3$: Since $27$ is divisible by the square of the prime $3$ (as $27 = 3 \\cdot 3^2$), $\\mu(27)=0$.\n    \\item For $d=81=3^4$: Since $81$ is divisible by the square of the prime $3$, $\\mu(81)=0$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe summation involves terms of the form $\\mu(d) \\ln(81/d)$. The terms for $d=9$, $d=27$, and $d=81$ are zero because $\\mu(d)=0$ for these divisors. We only need to consider the terms for $d=1$ and $d=3$.\n\nThe sum is:\n$$\nS(81; \\ln) = \\mu(1)\\ln\\left(\\frac{81}{1}\\right) + \\mu(3)\\ln\\left(\\frac{81}{3}\\right) + \\mu(9)\\ln\\left(\\frac{81}{9}\\right) + \\mu(27)\\ln\\left(\\frac{81}{27}\\right) + \\mu(81)\\ln\\left(\\frac{81}{81}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the values of $\\mu(d)$:\n$$\nS(81; \\ln) = (1) \\cdot \\ln(81) + (-1) \\cdot \\ln(27) + (0) \\cdot \\ln(9) + (0) \\cdot \\ln(3) + (0) \\cdot \\ln(1)\n$$\n$$\nS(81; \\ln) = \\ln(81) - \\ln(27)\n$$\nUsing the property of the natural logarithm that $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we have:\n$$\nS(81; \\ln) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{81}{27}\\right) = \\ln(3)\n$$\nAlternatively, using the property $\\ln(x^y) = y \\ln(x)$:\n$$\nS(81; \\ln) = \\ln(3^4) - \\ln(3^3) = 4\\ln(3) - 3\\ln(3) = (4-3)\\ln(3) = \\ln(3)\n$$\nThe direct computation yields the exact value $\\ln(3)$.\n\n**Method 2: Dirichlet Convolution and Interpretation**\n\nTo interpret this result in a broader context, we consider the structure of the summation. The given sum $S(n; f) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} \\mu(d) f(n/d)$ is the Dirichlet convolution of the Möbius function $\\mu$ and the arithmetic function $f$. We denote this by $(\\mu \\ast f)(n)$. The problem asks for the evaluation of $(\\mu \\ast \\ln)(81)$.\n\nThis expression is an instance of the Möbius inversion formula. Let us introduce the von Mangoldt function, $\\Lambda(n)$, defined as:\n$$\n\\Lambda(n) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\ln(p)  \\text{if } n=p^k \\text{ for some prime } p \\text{ and integer } k \\ge 1 \\\\\n0  \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nA fundamental identity in number theory relates the natural logarithm to the von Mangoldt function via a sum over divisors:\n$$\n\\sum_{d \\mid n} \\Lambda(d) = \\ln(n)\n$$\nIn the language of Dirichlet convolution, this identity is written as $(\\Lambda \\ast \\mathbf{1})(n) = \\ln(n)$, where $\\mathbf{1}(n)$ is the constant function $\\mathbf{1}(n)=1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$.\n\nThe sum we need to evaluate is $(\\mu \\ast \\ln)(n)$. Substituting the identity for $\\ln(n)$:\n$$\n(\\mu \\ast \\ln)(n) = (\\mu \\ast (\\Lambda \\ast \\mathbf{1}))(n)\n$$\nDirichlet convolution is associative, so we can regroup the terms:\n$$\n(\\mu \\ast (\\Lambda \\ast \\mathbf{1}))(n) = ((\\mu \\ast \\mathbf{1}) \\ast \\Lambda)(n)\n$$\nA defining property of the Möbius function is that it is the Dirichlet inverse of the constant function $\\mathbf{1}(n)$. That is, their convolution yields the identity element $\\epsilon$ for Dirichlet convolution:\n$$\n(\\mu \\ast \\mathbf{1})(n) = \\epsilon(n) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if } n=1 \\\\\n0  \\text{if } n1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression:\n$$\n((\\mu \\ast \\mathbf{1}) \\ast \\Lambda)(n) = (\\epsilon \\ast \\Lambda)(n)\n$$\nThe convolution of any arithmetic function $f$ with the identity element $\\epsilon$ returns the function $f$ itself: $(\\epsilon \\ast f)(n) = f(n)$. Therefore:\n$$\n(\\epsilon \\ast \\Lambda)(n) = \\Lambda(n)\n$$\nWe have thus demonstrated the general identity:\n$$\nS(n; \\ln) = \\sum_{d\\mid n}\\mu(d)\\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right) = \\Lambda(n)\n$$\nThe problem is reduced to evaluating the von Mangoldt function for $n=81$.\nSince $81=3^4$, it is a power of the prime $p=3$ with exponent $k=4 \\ge 1$. According to the definition of $\\Lambda(n)$, we have:\n$$\n\\Lambda(81) = \\ln(3)\n$$\nThis confirms the result from the direct computation.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThe identity $\\sum_{d\\mid n}\\mu(d)\\,\\ln(n/d) = \\Lambda(n)$ provides the required interpretation. The given summation is a formula for the von Mangoldt function. The von Mangoldt function $\\Lambda(n)$ is specifically designed to detect prime powers. It is non-zero only when its argument $n$ is a power of a single prime number, $p^k$. In such cases, its value is $\\ln(p)$, which isolates the logarithm of the prime base $p$.\n\nFor the specific case $n=81$, the number is a pure prime power, $3^4$. The summation, which is equivalent to $\\Lambda(81)$, correctly evaluates to $\\ln(3)$. This result precisely isolates and reveals the unique prime base of $81$. If $n$ were a number with multiple distinct prime factors (e.g., $n=12=2^2 \\cdot 3^1$), the sum would evaluate to $\\Lambda(12)=0$. Thus, the operation performs a fundamental analysis of the prime power structure of an integer, and the result $\\ln(3)$ signifies that $81$ is a power of the prime $3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\ln(3)}\n$$", "id": "3092134"}]}
