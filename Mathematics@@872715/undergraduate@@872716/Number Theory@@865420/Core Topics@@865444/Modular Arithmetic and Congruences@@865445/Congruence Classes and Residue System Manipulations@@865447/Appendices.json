First, we must construct a complete residue system using a given affine transformation and prove its validity. Second, we must calculate the sum of the elements of this new system and find its remainder modulo $26$.\n\nLet the modulus be $n=26$. The standard complete residue system (CRS) modulo $26$ is the set $S = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 25\\}$. The affine map is given by $T: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$, defined as $T(x) = ax+b$, with parameters $a=7$ and $b=10$. Thus, the transformation is $T(x) = 7x+10$.\n\nPart 1: Construction and Justification of the Complete Residue System\n\nWe are tasked with constructing a new set, which we will call $R'$, by applying the map $T$ to each element of $S$ and then taking the least nonnegative residue modulo $26$. The elements of $R'$ are the integers $y$ such that for each $x \\in S$, $y \\equiv T(x) \\pmod{26}$ and $0 \\le y \\le 25$. Formally, $R' = \\{ (7x+10) \\pmod{26} \\mid x \\in S \\}$.\n\nTo justify that $R'$ is a complete residue system modulo $26$, we must show that it contains exactly $26$ integers that are mutually incongruent modulo $26$. Since $R'$ is constructed from the $26$ elements of $S$, it has at most $26$ elements. We must prove it has exactly $26$ distinct elements. To do this, we show that the map $T$ is a permutation on the set of residue classes modulo $26$.\n\nConsider two elements $x_1, x_2 \\in S$. Assume that their images under $T$ are congruent modulo $26$:\n$$T(x_1) \\equiv T(x_2) \\pmod{26}$$\nSubstituting the definition of $T(x)$:\n$$7x_1 + 10 \\equiv 7x_2 + 10 \\pmod{26}$$\nBy subtracting $10$ from both sides of the congruence, we obtain:\n$$7x_1 \\equiv 7x_2 \\pmod{26}$$\nThis is a linear congruence. A crucial property of such congruences is that a factor can be canceled if it is coprime to the modulus. Let's compute the greatest common divisor of the coefficient $a=7$ and the modulus $n=26$:\n$$\\gcd(7, 26)$$\nThe prime factorization of $7$ is simply $7$. The prime factorization of $26$ is $2 \\times 13$. Since there are no common prime factors, the greatest common divisor is $1$.\n$$\\gcd(7, 26) = 1$$\nBecause $7$ and $26$ are coprime, $7$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $26$. Let's call it $7^{-1}$. We can multiply both sides of the congruence $7x_1 \\equiv 7x_2 \\pmod{26}$ by this inverse:\n$$7^{-1} \\cdot 7x_1 \\equiv 7^{-1} \\cdot 7x_2 \\pmod{26}$$\n$$1 \\cdot x_1 \\equiv 1 \\cdot x_2 \\pmod{26}$$\n$$x_1 \\equiv x_2 \\pmod{26}$$\nSince $x_1$ and $x_2$ were chosen from the set $S = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 25\\}$, they are both least nonnegative residues. If they are congruent modulo $26$, they must be equal: $x_1 = x_2$.\n\nThis demonstrates that if $x_1 \\neq x_2$, then $T(x_1) \\not\\equiv T(x_2) \\pmod{26}$. Therefore, the map $T$ is injective on the set of residue classes modulo $26$. An injective map from a finite set to itself is also surjective, and thus bijective. This means that applying $T$ to the $26$ distinct elements of $S$ generates a set of $26$ distinct residues modulo $26$. When these residues are reduced to their least nonnegative values, the resulting set $R'$ must be a permutation of the original set of residues $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 25\\}$.\nThus, as a set, $R'$ is identical to $S$:\n$$R' = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 25\\}$$\nThe set $R'$ is therefore a complete residue system modulo $26$.\n\nPart 2: Sum of the Elements of the Constructed Set\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the least nonnegative residue modulo $26$ of the sum of all elements in the set $R'$. Let this sum be denoted by $\\Sigma$.\nSince we established that $R' = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 25\\}$, the sum of its elements is:\n$$\\Sigma = \\sum_{k=0}^{25} k$$\nThis is the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of the first $m$ non-negative integers is given by the formula $\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$. For our case, $m=25$:\n$$\\Sigma = \\frac{25(25+1)}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 26}{2} = 25 \\times 13$$\nThe sum is $\\Sigma = 325$.\n\nWe need to find the least nonnegative residue of $\\Sigma$ modulo $26$. This is equivalent to computing $325 \\pmod{26}$.\nWe can perform the division: $325 = 12 \\times 26 + 13$. The remainder is $13$.\nSo, $325 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{26}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum modulo $26$ directly from the expression $\\Sigma = 25 \\times 13$:\n$$\\Sigma \\pmod{26} \\equiv (25 \\times 13) \\pmod{26}$$\nWe observe that $25 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{26}$. Substituting this into the congruence:\n$$25 \\times 13 \\equiv (-1) \\times 13 \\pmod{26}$$\n$$25 \\times 13 \\equiv -13 \\pmod{26}$$\nTo express this as a least nonnegative residue, we add the modulus $26$:\n$$-13 \\pmod{26} \\equiv -13+26 \\pmod{26} \\equiv 13 \\pmod{26}$$\nBoth methods produce the same result. The least nonnegative residue of the sum is $13$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{13} $$", "id": "3083570"}, {"introduction": "The previous practice hinted at the importance of elements $a$ that are relatively prime to the modulus $n$.

The first part is a proof of existence and uniqueness of a multiplicative inverse modulo a prime power. The second part is a specific computation of such an inverse.\n\n### Part 1: Proof of Existence and Uniqueness\n\nWe are asked to prove that if $p$ is a prime, $k \\geq 1$ is an integer, and $a$ is an integer such that $p \\nmid a$, then there exists a unique residue class $[x]$ modulo $p^k$ such that $ax \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^k}$.\n\n**Existence of the Multiplicative Inverse**\n\nThe proof relies on the given condition $p \\nmid a$ and Bézout's identity.\nLet $n = p^k$. The condition for an integer $a$ to have a multiplicative inverse modulo $n$ is that $\\gcd(a, n) = 1$.\nThe prime factorization of $n=p^k$ consists only of the prime $p$.\nThe condition $p \\nmid a$ means that $p$ is not a prime factor of $a$.\nSince $a$ and $p^k$ share no prime factors, their greatest common divisor must be $1$. Thus, $\\gcd(a, p^k) = 1$.\n\nAs stated in the problem, we can use Bézout's identity, which asserts that if $\\gcd(a, p^k) = 1$, then there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that:\n$$ax + p^k y = 1$$\nWe can analyze this equation using the definition of congruence modulo $p^k$. The equation can be rewritten as:\n$$ax - 1 = (-y)p^k$$\nThis shows that $p^k$ divides $ax - 1$, since $-y$ is an integer. By the definition of congruence ($u \\equiv v \\pmod{n}$ if and only if $n \\mid (u-v)$), we have:\n$$ax \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^k}$$\nThis demonstrates the existence of an integer $x$ that serves as a multiplicative inverse for $a$ modulo $p^k$. The residue class $[x]$ is therefore the multiplicative inverse of the residue class $[a]$ modulo $p^k$.\n\n**Uniqueness of the Multiplicative Inverse**\n\nTo prove uniqueness, we assume that there are two integers, $x_1$ and $x_2$, that both act as multiplicative inverses for $a$ modulo $p^k$. We must show that they belong to the same residue class, i.e., $x_1 \\equiv x_2 \\pmod{p^k}$.\n\nBy our assumption, we have two congruences:\n$$ax_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^k}$$\n$$ax_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^k}$$\nStarting with the first congruence, $ax_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^k}$, we can multiply both sides by $x_2$:\n$$x_2(ax_1) \\equiv x_2(1) \\pmod{p^k}$$\nUsing the associative and commutative properties of integer multiplication, we get:\n$$(x_2a)x_1 \\equiv x_2 \\pmod{p^k}$$\n$$(ax_2)x_1 \\equiv x_2 \\pmod{p^k}$$\nFrom our second initial assumption, we know that $ax_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^k}$. Substituting this into the left side of the congruence gives:\n$$(1)x_1 \\equiv x_2 \\pmod{p^k}$$\n$$x_1 \\equiv x_2 \\pmod{p^k}$$\nThis shows that any two integers that act as multiplicative inverses for $a$ must be congruent modulo $p^k$. Therefore, they belong to the same residue class, and the multiplicative inverse residue class is unique.\n\n### Part 2: Computation of the Inverse\n\nWe are asked to compute the inverse of $a=12345$ modulo $p^k = 7^5 = 16807$. First, we verify the condition $p \\nmid a$, which is $7 \\nmid 12345$.\nDividing $12345$ by $7$ gives $12345 = 7 \\times 1763 + 4$. Since the remainder is non-zero, $7$ does not divide $12345$. The condition is satisfied, so a unique inverse exists.\n\nWe will use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) to find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $12345x + 16807y = \\gcd(12345, 16807)$. Since we have established that the gcd is $1$, we are solving:\n$$12345x + 16807y = 1$$\nThe integer $x$ found will be the multiplicative inverse of $12345$ modulo $16807$.\n\nThe EEA proceeds by running the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd of $16807$ and $12345$, while keeping track of coefficients that express each remainder as a linear combination of the original two numbers.\n\nLet $r_0 = 16807$ and $r_1 = 12345$.\nThe steps of the Euclidean algorithm are:\n\\begin{align*} 16807 = 1 \\cdot 12345 + 4462 \\\\ 12345 = 2 \\cdot 4462 + 3421 \\\\ 4462 = 1 \\cdot 3421 + 1041 \\\\ 3421 = 3 \\cdot 1041 + 298 \\\\ 1041 = 3 \\cdot 298 + 147 \\\\ 298 = 2 \\cdot 147 + 4 \\\\ 147 = 36 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\\\ 4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\\\ 3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\end{align*}\nThe last non-zero remainder is $1$, so $\\gcd(12345, 16807) = 1$, as expected.\n\nBy systematically working backwards (or by using the tabular form of the EEA), we find a linear combination for each remainder. The final step expresses $1$ as a combination of $12345$ and $16807$. Performing the full EEA calculation yields the identity:\n$$ (12345)(4230) + (16807)(-3107) = 1 $$\nTaking this equation modulo $16807$:\n$$ (12345)(4230) + (16807)(-3107) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16807} $$\nSince $16807 \\cdot (-3107)$ is a multiple of $16807$, it is congruent to $0 \\pmod{16807}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ (12345)(4230) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16807} $$\nThis shows that $x=4230$ is the multiplicative inverse of $12345$ modulo $16807$.\nThe problem requires the answer to be the least nonnegative residue in the set $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 7^5-1\\}$, which is $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 16806\\}$.\nSince $0 \\leq 4230 \\leq 16806$, our result $4230$ is the desired representative.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4230}$$", "id": "3083597"}, {"introduction": "While solving a single linear congruence is a foundational skill, many problems require solving several simultaneously.

Therefore, a solution $k$ exists if and only if:\n$$\n\\gcd(m, n) \\mid (b - a).\n$$\nThis condition is equivalent to the statement $a \\equiv b \\pmod{\\gcd(m,n)}$. This establishes the **solvability condition** for the original system of congruences.\n\nNow, let's analyze the properties of the solution set, assuming the solvability condition $a \\equiv b \\pmod{\\gcd(m,n)}$ is met. Let $d = \\gcd(m,n)$.\n\nLet $x_0$ be a particular solution to the system. Then any other solution $x$ must satisfy:\n$$\nx \\equiv x_0 \\pmod{m} \\implies m \\mid (x-x_0)\n$$\n$$\nx \\equiv x_0 \\pmod{n} \\implies n \\mid (x-x_0)\n$$\nSince both $m$ and $n$ divide $(x-x_0)$, their least common multiple, $\\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)$, must also divide $(x-x_0)$. This means:\n$$\n\\operatorname{lcm}(m,n) \\mid (x-x_0),\n$$\nwhich is equivalent to $x \\equiv x_0 \\pmod{\\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)}$.\nConversely, if $x \\equiv x_0 \\pmod{\\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)}$, then $\\operatorname{lcm}(m,n) \\mid (x-x_0)$. Since $m \\mid \\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)$ and $n \\mid \\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)$, it follows by transitivity that $m \\mid (x-x_0)$ and $n \\mid (x-x_0)$. This means $x \\equiv x_0 \\pmod m$ and $x \\equiv x_0 \\pmod n$. Since $x_0$ is a solution, $x_0 \\equiv a \\pmod m$ and $x_0 \\equiv b \\pmod n$. Thus, $x \\equiv a \\pmod m$ and $x \\equiv b \\pmod n$, which means $x$ is also a solution.\nThis shows that if a solution $x_0$ exists, the set of all solutions is precisely the congruence class $[x_0]$ modulo $\\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)$.

The greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(4,6) = 2$. The solvability condition requires $1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{2}$, which means $2 \\mid (1-2)$, or $2 \\mid -1$. This is false.

They are congruent modulo $mn$ if and only if $mn \\mid (x_k - x_j)$, which is $mn \\mid (k-j)L$.\n- This is equivalent to $\\frac{mn}{L} \\mid (k-j)$.\n- Using the fundamental identity $\\operatorname{lcm}(m,n) \\cdot \\gcd(m,n) = mn$, we have $L \\cdot d = mn$, so $\\frac{mn}{L} = d = \\gcd(m,n)$.\n- The condition becomes $\\gcd(m,n) \\mid (k-j)$.\n- This means that the solutions $x_k$ repeat modulo $mn$ with a period of $d = \\gcd(m,n)$ for the index $k$.\n- The values of $k$ given by $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, d-1$ will produce solutions that are incongruent modulo $mn$.

The system is solvable if and only if $a \\equiv b \\pmod{mn}$.**\n- This proposes an alternative solvability condition. Let's test it.\n- ($\\Leftarrow$) If $a \\equiv b \\pmod{mn}$, then $mn \\mid (a-b)$. Since $\\gcd(m,n)$ divides $m$, and $m$ divides $mn$, it follows that $\\gcd(m,n) \\mid (a-b)$. So, $a \\equiv b \\pmod{\\gcd(m,n)}$, which is our proven solvability condition. Thus, if $a \\equiv b \\pmod{mn}$, the system is solvable. This direction holds.\n- ($\\Rightarrow$) If the system is solvable, then $a \\equiv b \\pmod{\\gcd(m,n)}$. Does this imply $a \\equiv b \\pmod{mn}$? No. Let's use the counterexample from B, but modify it to be solvable. Let $m=4, n=6, a=1, b=3$. $\\gcd(4,6) = 2$. The condition $1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{2}$ is true since $2 \\mid (1-3)$. So the system is solvable. A solution is $x=9$ ($9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $9 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}$). However, $mn=24$. Is $1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{24}$? No, $24 \\nmid -2$.\n- Since the implication does not hold in both directions, the \"if and only if\" statement is false.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.
