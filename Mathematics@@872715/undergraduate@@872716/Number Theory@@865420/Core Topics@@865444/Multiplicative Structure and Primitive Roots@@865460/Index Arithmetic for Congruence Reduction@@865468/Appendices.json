The order of $g$ modulo $p$ is $\\phi(p) = p-1 = 78$. A fundamental property of primitive roots is that they allow the conversion of exponential congruences into linear congruences via index arithmetic. The index of an integer $a$ to the base $g$ modulo $p$, denoted $\\text{ind}_g(a)$, is the unique exponent $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, p-1\\}$ such that $g^k \\equiv a \\pmod p$.\n\nThe given congruence is $g^{u x}\\equiv g^{v}\\pmod p$.

If this condition is met, there are exactly $d$ incongruent solutions modulo $n$. The existence of solutions is thus controlled by the divisibility of $v$ by $d=\\gcd(u, p-1)$. The number of solutions is directly given by $d$.\n\nIn our specific case, $a=u=30$, $b=v=42$, and $n=p-1=78$. We first compute $d = \\gcd(30, 78)$.\nThe prime factorization of $30$ is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5$.\nThe prime factorization of $78$ is $2 \\times 3 \\times 13$.\nThe greatest common divisor is $d = \\gcd(30, 78) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\nNext, we check the solvability condition: does $d$ divide $v$? Here, $d=6$ and $v=42$. Since $42 = 6 \\times 7$, $d$ divides $v$. Therefore, solutions exist.\nThe number of distinct solutions for $x$ modulo $78$ is exactly $d=6$.\n\nTo find the solutions, we first simplify the congruence $30x \\equiv 42 \\pmod{78}$ by dividing all terms (the coefficient, the constant, and the modulus) by their common divisor $d=6$.\n$$\n\\frac{30}{6}x \\equiv \\frac{42}{6} \\pmod{\\frac{78}{6}}\n$$\nThis yields the reduced congruence:\n$$\n5x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{13}\n$$\nTo solve for $x$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of $5$ modulo $13$. We seek an integer $y$ such that $5y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or inspection. By inspection, we find that $5 \\times 8 = 40$. Since $40 = 3 \\times 13 + 1$, we have $5 \\times 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$. Thus, the inverse of $5$ modulo $13$ is $8$.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the reduced congruence by $8$:\n$$\n8 \\cdot (5x) \\equiv 8 \\cdot 7 \\pmod{13}\n$$\n$$\n(40)x \\equiv 56 \\pmod{13}\n$$\n$$\nx \\equiv 56 \\pmod{13}\n$$\nTo find the smallest non-negative residue, we reduce $56$ modulo $13$. Since $56 = 4 \\times 13 + 4$, we have $56 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$.\nSo, one particular solution is $x_0 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$. This means $x_0 = 4$ is the smallest non-negative solution to the reduced congruence.\n\nThis solution $x_0=4$ is one of the $6$ solutions to the original congruence modulo $78$. The full set of solutions is given by the formula:\n$$\nx_k = x_0 + k \\cdot \\frac{n}{d} \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, d-1\\}\n$$\nIn our case, $x_0 = 4$, $n=78$, and $d=6$. The increment between solutions is $\\frac{n}{d} = \\frac{78}{6} = 13$. This spacing is a direct consequence of the algebraic structure of the solution set. If $x_0$ is a solution, then for any integer $k$, $u(x_0 + k \\frac{p-1}{d}) = ux_0 + k\\frac{u}{d}(p-1)$. Since $d=\\gcd(u, p-1)$, $\\frac{u}{d}$ is an integer, so $k\\frac{u}{d}(p-1)$ is a multiple of $p-1$. Consequently, $u(x_0 + k \\frac{p-1}{d}) \\equiv ux_0 \\equiv v \\pmod{p-1}$.

Solution Derivation:**\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the exponential congruence $a^{x} \\equiv b \\pmod p$ and the determination of the number of its solutions for a specific case.\n\nFirst, we reduce the exponential congruence to a linear congruence using the properties of the index. Since $g$ is a primitive root modulo $p$, the group of nonzero residues modulo $p$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, is a cyclic group of order $p-1$ generated by $g$. The index function $\\operatorname{ind}_{g}: (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/(p-1)\\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is a group isomorphism. This means it maps multiplication in the domain to addition in the codomain.\n\nThe initial congruence is:\n$$a^{x} \\equiv b \\pmod p$$\nTaking the index with respect to the primitive root $g$ on both sides is a valid operation because $a$ and $b$ are nonzero modulo $p$ (as they are powers of $g$). This yields a congruence for the exponents modulo the order of the group, which is $p-1$:\n$$\\operatorname{ind}_{g}(a^{x}) \\equiv \\operatorname{ind}_{g}(b) \\pmod{p-1}$$\nA fundamental property of indices is $\\operatorname{ind}_{g}(u^k) \\equiv k \\cdot \\operatorname{ind}_{g}(u) \\pmod{p-1}$. Applying this property, we obtain:\n$$x \\cdot \\operatorname{ind}_{g}(a) \\equiv \\operatorname{ind}_{g}(b) \\pmod{p-1}$$\nThis is the required linear congruence in the variable $x$. It is of the form $A x \\equiv B \\pmod m$, where $A = \\operatorname{ind}_{g}(a)$, $B = \\operatorname{ind}_{g}(b)$, and $m = p-1$.\n\nNext, we analyze the number of solutions to this linear congruence. A congruence of the form $Ax \\equiv B \\pmod m$ has solutions for $x$ if and only if $d | B$, where $d = \\gcd(A, m)$. If this condition is met, there are exactly $d$ incongruent solutions for $x$ modulo $m$.\n\nThe source of this potential multiplicity of solutions is the fact that the coefficient $A = \\operatorname{ind}_{g}(a)$ may not be coprime to the modulus $m = p-1$. When $\\gcd(\\operatorname{ind}_g(a), p-1) = d  1$, the element $a$ is not a generator of the full group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. Instead, it generates a smaller cyclic subgroup of order $\\frac{p-1}{d}$. The congruence $a^x \\equiv b \\pmod p$ has a solution if and only if $b$ is an element of this subgroup. The condition $d | \\operatorname{ind}_g(b)$ is the algebraic translation of this requirement. If a solution $x_0$ exists, then any other solution $x$ must satisfy $a^x \\equiv a^{x_0} \\pmod p$, which implies $a^{x-x_0} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. This means $x-x_0$ must be a multiple of the order of $a$ modulo $p$. The order of $a=g^{\\operatorname{ind}_g(a)}$ is $\\frac{p-1}{\\gcd(\\operatorname{ind}_g(a),p-1)} = \\frac{p-1}{d}$. So, solutions are of the form $x = x_0 + k \\frac{p-1}{d}$ for some integer $k$. Considering solutions modulo $p-1$, there are exactly $d$ such incongruent solutions, given by $k=0, 1, \\dots, d-1$. Therefore, the number of incongruent solutions is precisely $d = \\gcd(\\operatorname{ind}_g(a), p-1)$, provided a solution exists.\n\nNow, we apply this framework to the given concrete instance:\n$p = 29$ and $g = 2$.\nThe modulus for the linear congruence is $p-1 = 28$.\nWe are given $a \\equiv g^{14} \\pmod p$ and $b \\equiv g^{14} \\pmod p$.\nThis means $a \\equiv 2^{14} \\pmod{29}$ and $b \\equiv 2^{14} \\pmod{29}$.\n\nFrom the definition of the index, we can directly identify the indices of $a$ and $b$:\n$\\operatorname{ind}_{g}(a) = \\operatorname{ind}_{2}(2^{14}) = 14$.\n$\\operatorname{ind}_{g}(b) = \\operatorname{ind}_{2}(2^{14}) = 14$.\nNote that the index is defined in the range $[0, p-2]$, which is $[0, 27]$. Since $0 \\le 14 \\le 27$, this is the correct value.\n\nThe linear congruence $x \\cdot \\operatorname{ind}_{g}(a) \\equiv \\operatorname{ind}_{g}(b) \\pmod{p-1}$ becomes:\n$$14x \\equiv 14 \\pmod{28}$$\nHere, $A=14$, $B=14$, and $m=28$.\n\nTo find the number of solutions, we first compute $d = \\gcd(A, m)$:\n$$d = \\gcd(14, 28)$$\nSince $28 = 2 \\times 14$, the greatest common divisor is $14$.\n$$d = 14$$\nNext, we check the condition for the existence of solutions: $d | B$. In this case, we check if $14 | 14$. This is true.\nSince the existence condition is satisfied, the number of incongruent solutions for $x$ modulo $28$ is exactly $d$.\n\nThus, the number of incongruent solutions is $14$.\nFor completeness, the solutions are the integers $x$ such that $14x - 14$ is a multiple of $28$. Dividing by $14$, we get $x - 1$ is a multiple of $2$, i.e., $x-1$ is even, so $x$ must be odd. The odd integers in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 27\\}$ are $1, 3, 5, \\dots, 27$. There are indeed $14$ such values.\nThe final answer is the number of incongruent solutions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14}$$", "id": "3086039"}]}
