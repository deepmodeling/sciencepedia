First, we compute Euler's totient function $\\varphi(n)$ for $n=40$ and verify Euler's theorem for $a=3$. Second, we determine the multiplicative order of $3$ modulo $40$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of $\\varphi(40)$ and Verification of Euler's Theorem**\n\nWe are given $n=40$. To compute $\\varphi(40)$, we first find the prime factorization of $40$.\n$$40 = 8 \\times 5 = 2^3 \\times 5^1$$\nEuler's totient function $\\varphi(n)$ is multiplicative, meaning that if $\\gcd(m, k)=1$, then $\\varphi(mk) = \\varphi(m)\\varphi(k)$. For a prime power $p^k$, the formula is $\\varphi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}$.\nUsing these properties, we compute $\\varphi(40)$:\n$$\\varphi(40) = \\varphi(2^3 \\times 5^1) = \\varphi(2^3) \\varphi(5^1)$$\nThe individual values are:\n$$\\varphi(2^3) = 2^3 - 2^2 = 8 - 4 = 4$$\n$$\\varphi(5^1) = 5^1 - 5^0 = 5 - 1 = 4$$\nTherefore, the value of $\\varphi(40)$ is:\n$$\\varphi(40) = 4 \\times 4 = 16$$\nThis means that the multiplicative group of units modulo $40$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/40\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, has $16$ elements.\n\nNext, we must verify Euler's theorem for $a=3$ and $n=40$. First, we confirm that $\\gcd(3, 40) = 1$. The prime factors of $40$ are $2$ and $5$, and neither divides $3$, so the condition is met. Euler's theorem states that $a^{\\varphi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, which in our case is $3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40}$.\nWe can verify this by computing powers of $3$ modulo $40$:\n$$3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{40}$$\n$$3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{40}$$\n$$3^3 \\equiv 27 \\pmod{40}$$\n$$3^4 \\equiv 3 \\times 27 = 81 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40}$$\nNow that we have found that $3^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40}$, we can use this result to compute $3^{16} \\pmod{40}$. Since $16 = 4 \\times 4$, we have:\n$$3^{16} = 3^{4 \\times 4} = (3^4)^4$$\nSubstituting the congruence $3^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40}$:\n$$(3^4)^4 \\equiv 1^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40}$$\nThus, we have verified that $3^{\\varphi(40)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40}$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Multiplicative Order**\n\nWe are asked to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $3^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40}$. This integer $k$ is the multiplicative order of $3$ modulo $40$, denoted $\\text{ord}_{40}(3)$. The problem specifies using the structure of $(\\mathbb{Z}/40\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ and orders modulo coprime moduli. This suggests using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).\n\nSince $40 = 8 \\times 5$ and $\\gcd(8, 5) = 1$, the CRT implies a group isomorphism:\n$$(\\mathbb{Z}/40\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$$\nThe congruence $3^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40}$ is equivalent to the system of congruences:\n$$3^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$$\n$$3^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$$\nFor this system to hold, $k$ must be a multiple of the order of $3$ modulo $8$ and also a multiple of the order of $3$ modulo $5$. The smallest such positive integer $k$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of these two orders.\n$$k = \\text{ord}_{40}(3) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}_{8}(3), \\text{ord}_{5}(3))$$\n\nFirst, we find the order of $3$ modulo $8$. The group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times = \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n$$3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$$\n$$3^2 = 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$$\nThe order of $3$ modulo $8$ is $\\text{ord}_{8}(3) = 2$.\n\nNext, we find the order of $3$ modulo $5$. The group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^\\times = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n$$3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$$\n$$3^2 = 9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$$\n$$3^3 = 27 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$$\n$$3^4 = 81 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$$\nThe order of $3$ modulo $5$ is $\\text{ord}_{5}(3) = 4$.\n\nFinally, we compute the least common multiple of these orders to find the order of $3$ modulo $40$:\n$$k = \\text{lcm}(2, 4) = 4$$\nThe smallest positive integer $k$ such that $3^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40}$ is $4$. This is consistent with our calculation in Part 1, where we incidentally found that $3^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40}$, and since $3^1$, $3^2$, and $3^3$ are not congruent to $1$ modulo $40$, $4$ is indeed the smallest such exponent.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "3092419"}, {"introduction": "While many multiplicative groups are cyclic, some of the most fundamental examples are not, and understanding them is crucial to grasping the full picture of cyclicity criteria.

It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information to arrive at a unique solution. We proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the multiplicative group of units modulo $8$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. This group consists of all residue classes $[\\bar{a}]$ modulo $8$ such that the greatest common divisor of the representative integer $a$ and $8$ is $1$. The integers $a$ in the range $1 \\le a \\le 8$ that are coprime to $8$ are $1, 3, 5,$ and $7$.\nThis is because $\\gcd(1, 8) = 1$, $\\gcd(3, 8) = 1$, $\\gcd(5, 8) = 1$, and $\\gcd(7, 8) = 1$, while all other integers in this range ($2, 4, 6, 8$) share a common factor greater than $1$ with $8$.\nThus, the elements of the group are:\n$$ (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times = \\{[\\bar{1}], [\\bar{3}], [\\bar{5}], [\\bar{7}]\\} $$\nThe order of the group, denoted by $|(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times|$, is the number of its elements, which is $4$. This is also given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(8) = 8(1 - \\frac{1}{2}) = 4$.\n\nNext, we determine the order of each element in the group. The order of an element $[\\bar{a}]$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $[\\bar{a}]^k = [\\bar{1}]$, where $[\\bar{1}]$ is the identity element of the group.\n\n1.  **Element $[\\bar{1}]$**: By definition, $[\\bar{1}]^1 = [\\bar{1}]$. So, the order of $[\\bar{1}]$ is $1$.\n\n2.  **Element $[\\bar{3}]$**: We compute its powers modulo $8$.\n    $$ [\\bar{3}]^1 = [\\bar{3}] $$\n    $$ [\\bar{3}]^2 = [\\bar{9}] \\equiv [\\bar{1}] \\pmod{8} $$\n    Since we have reached the identity element, the order of $[\\bar{3}]$ is $2$.\n\n3.  **Element $[\\bar{5}]$**: We compute its powers modulo $8$.\n    $$ [\\bar{5}]^1 = [\\bar{5}] $$\n    $$ [\\bar{5}]^2 = [\\bar{25}] \\equiv [\\bar{1}] \\pmod{8} $$\n    The order of $[\\bar{5}]$ is $2$.\n\n4.  **Element $[\\bar{7}]$**: We compute its powers modulo $8$.\n    $$ [\\bar{7}]^1 = [\\bar{7}] $$\n    $$ [\\bar{7}]^2 = [\\bar{49}] \\equiv [\\bar{1}] \\pmod{8} $$\n    The order of $[\\bar{7}]$ is $2$.\n\nTo summarize the orders of the elements:\n- Order of $[\\bar{1}]$ is $1$.\n- Order of $[\\bar{3}]$ is $2$.\n- Order of $[\\bar{5}]$ is $2$.\n- Order of $[\\bar{7}]$ is $2$.\n\nA group is cyclic if and only if there exists an element, called a generator, whose order is equal to the order of the group. The order of our group $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is $4$. However, as we have just calculated, no element in the group has an order of $4$. The maximum order of any element is $2$. Therefore, $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ does not have a generator and is **not a cyclic group**.\n\nThis non-cyclicity has a direct consequence. For any element $[\\bar{g}] \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, the subgroup generated by $[\\bar{g}]$, denoted $\\langle [\\bar{g}] \\rangle$, consists of all powers of $[\\bar{g}]$. The size of this subgroup is equal to the order of $[\\bar{g}]$. Since the maximum order of any element is $2$, the largest subgroup generated by a single element has size $2$. For instance, $\\langle [\\bar{3}] \\rangle = \\{[\\bar{1}], [\\bar{3}]\\}$.\nBecause the total size of the group is $4$, for any choice of $[\\bar{g}]$, the subgroup $\\langle [\\bar{g}] \\rangle$ is a proper subgroup of $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. This means that there must always be elements in $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ that are not in $\\langle [\\bar{g}] \\rangle$. In other words, for any $[\\bar{g}]$, there exists a unit $[\\bar{u}]$ that is not a power of $[\\bar{g}]$.\n\nThe problem asks for a concrete certificate of this fact for the specific choice of $[\\bar{g}] = [\\bar{5}]$. We need to find a unit $[\\bar{u}] \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ such that $[\\bar{u}]$ cannot be written as a power of $[\\bar{5}]$.\nFirst, let's determine the set of all powers of $[\\bar{5}]$. This is the subgroup generated by $[\\bar{5}]$.\n$$ \\langle [\\bar{5}] \\rangle = \\{ [\\bar{5}]^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\} $$\nSince the order of $[\\bar{5}]$ is $2$, the distinct powers are:\n$$ [\\bar{5}]^0 = [\\bar{1}] $$\n$$ [\\bar{5}]^1 = [\\bar{5}] $$\nHigher powers will cycle through these two values (e.g., $[\\bar{5}]^2 = [\\bar{1}]$, $[\\bar{5}]^3 = [\\bar{5}]$, etc.). So, the subgroup generated by $[\\bar{5}]$ is:\n$$ \\langle [\\bar{5}] \\rangle = \\{[\\bar{1}], [\\bar{5}]\\} $$\nWe are looking for an element $[\\bar{u}] \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ that is not in this subgroup. The full set of elements is $\\{[\\bar{1}], [\\bar{3}], [\\bar{5}], [\\bar{7}]\\}$. The elements not in $\\langle [\\bar{5}] \\rangle$ are $[\\bar{3}]$ and $[\\bar{7}]$.\nEither of these can serve as our $[\\bar{u}]$. The problem states to report the least positive integer representative $u$ for the class $[\\bar{u}]$. The integer representatives for our choices are $3$ and $7$. The least of these is $3$.\nTherefore, we choose $[\\bar{u}] = [\\bar{3}]$. We can verify that $[\\bar{3}]$ is not a power of $[\\bar{5}]$ as $[\\bar{3}] \\ne [\\bar{1}]$ and $[\\bar{3}] \\ne [\\bar{5}]$.

The analysis will proceed according to the specified constraints.\n\nFirst, we determine the order of the group, $\\phi(98)$. The problem requires this to be done by counting units from first principles. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/98\\mathbb{Z}$ correspond to integers $a$ such that $1 \\leq a \\leq 98$ and $\\gcd(a, 98) = 1$. The prime factorization of $98$ is $2 \\cdot 7^2$. Therefore, an integer $a$ is relatively prime to $98$ if and only if it is not divisible by $2$ and not divisible by $7$. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion on the set $S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 98\\}$.\nLet $A_k$ be the subset of $S$ containing multiples of $k$.\nThe number of integers in $S$ is $|S| = 98$.\nThe number of integers divisible by $2$ is $|A_2| = \\lfloor\\frac{98}{2}\\rfloor = 49$.\nThe number of integers divisible by $7$ is $|A_7| = \\lfloor\\frac{98}{7}\\rfloor = 14$.\nAn integer is not relatively prime to $98$ if it is divisible by $2$ or $7$. The number of such integers is $|A_2 \\cup A_7|$.\nThe set of integers divisible by both $2$ and $7$ is the set of multiples of their least common multiple, which is $14$. The size of this set is $|A_2 \\cap A_7| = |A_{14}| = \\lfloor\\frac{98}{14}\\rfloor = 7$.\nBy the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of integers that are not units is:\n$$|A_2 \\cup A_7| = |A_2| + |A_7| - |A_2 \\cap A_7| = 49 + 14 - 7 = 56$$\nThe number of units, $\\phi(98)$, is the total number of integers minus those that are not units:\n$$\\phi(98) = |S| - |A_2 \\cup A_7| = 98 - 56 = 42$$\n\nSecond, we determine the exponent of the group, $\\lambda(98)$. The Carmichael function $\\lambda(n)$ is the exponent of $(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. Since $98 = 2 \\cdot 49$ and $\\gcd(2, 49) = 1$, the Chinese Remainder Theorem provides a group isomorphism:\n$$(\\mathbb{Z}/98\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$$\nThe exponent of a direct product of finite abelian groups is the least common multiple of the exponents of the factor groups. Hence:\n$$\\lambda(98) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\lambda(2), \\lambda(49))$$\nWe evaluate the exponent for each factor.\nThe group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ consists of a single element, $[1]_2$. Its order is $\\phi(2) = 1$. The exponent is therefore $\\lambda(2) = 1$.\nThe group $(\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^\\times = (\\mathbb{Z}/7^2\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(49) = \\phi(7^2) = 7^2 - 7^1 = 49 - 7 = 42$. A standard theorem of number theory states that for an odd prime $p$ and any integer $k \\geq 1$, the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic. Since $7$ is an odd prime, $(\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is a cyclic group. The exponent of a finite cyclic group is equal to its order. Therefore, $\\lambda(49) = \\phi(49) = 42$.\nCombining these results, we find $\\lambda(98)$:\n$$\\lambda(98) = \\operatorname{lcm}(1, 42) = 42$$\n\nThird, we decide whether a primitive root modulo $98$ exists. A primitive root modulo $n$ exists if and only if the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic. A finite abelian group is cyclic if and only if its exponent is equal to its order.\nWe have determined the order of the group to be $\\phi(98) = 42$ and its exponent to be $\\lambda(98) = 42$.\nSince $\\phi(98) = \\lambda(98)$, the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/98\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is indeed cyclic. Consequently, a primitive root modulo $98$ exists. This corresponds to a value of $I=1$ for the indicator variable.\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with the general criteria for the existence of primitive roots: a primitive root modulo $n$ exists if and only if $n$ is $2$, $4$, $p^k$, or $2p^k$ for an odd prime $p$ and $k \\geq 1$. Our integer $n=98=2 \\cdot 7^2$ fits the form $2p^k$ with $p=7$ and $k=2$.\n\nTo summarize, we have found:\n- $\\phi(98) = 42$\n- $\\lambda(98) = 42$\n- $I = 1$ because a primitive root exists.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}\\phi(98)  \\lambda(98)  I\\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n42  42  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3092427"}]}
