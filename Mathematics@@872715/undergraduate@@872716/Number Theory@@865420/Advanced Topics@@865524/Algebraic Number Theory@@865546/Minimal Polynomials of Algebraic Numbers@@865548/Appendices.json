An algebraic number over a field $\\mathbb{K}$ is a number that serves as a root of a non-zero polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{K}$. The minimal polynomial of an algebraic number $α$ over $\\mathbb{K}$ is the unique monic polynomial of least positive degree in $\\mathbb{K}[x]$ that has $α$ as a root. A fundamental property of the minimal polynomial is that it must be irreducible over the field $\\mathbb{K}$.\n\nThe given condition is $α^{3} = 2$. This can be rearranged into the polynomial equation $α^{3} - 2 = 0$. This suggests that $α$ is a root of the polynomial $p(x) = x^{3} - 2$. Let us examine this candidate polynomial.\n\nThe polynomial $p(x) = x^{3} - 2$ has coefficients $1$ and $-2$, both of which are elements of the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. Furthermore, the leading coefficient is $1$, which means $p(x)$ is a monic polynomial. By its construction, $p(α) = α^{3} - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0$, so $α$ is indeed a root of $p(x)$.\n\nTo establish that $p(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $α$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we must demonstrate that it is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. If it were reducible, it would have to be the product of polynomials of lower degree with rational coefficients. Since $p(x)$ has degree $3$, if it were reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it must have a linear factor of the form $(x - c)$ where $c$ is a rational root. Therefore, proving that $p(x)$ has no rational roots is sufficient to prove its irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that we must use the Rational Root Test to justify this part of the argument. The Rational Root Test states that for a polynomial with integer coefficients, $a_n x^n + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0$, any rational root $\\frac{r}{s}$ (in lowest terms) must satisfy the conditions that $r$ divides the constant term $a_0$ and $s$ divides the leading coefficient $a_n$.\n\nFor our polynomial, $p(x) = x^3 - 2$, the coefficients are integers. The leading coefficient is $a_3 = 1$, and the constant term is $a_0 = -2$.\nAccording to the Rational Root Test, any potential rational root $\\frac{r}{s}$ must have:\n- $r$ as a divisor of $a_0 = -2$. The integer divisors of $-2$ are $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\}$.\n- $s$ as a divisor of $a_3 = 1$. The integer divisors of $1$ are $\\{\\pm 1\\}$.\n\nThus, the set of all possible rational roots for $p(x)$ is given by the set of fractions $\\frac{r}{s}$, which is $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\}$. We now test each of these candidates by direct substitution into $p(x)$:\n- For $x = 1$: $p(1) = (1)^{3} - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1 \\neq 0$.\n- For $x = -1$: $p(-1) = (-1)^{3} - 2 = -1 - 2 = -3 \\neq 0$.\n- For $x = 2$: $p(2) = (2)^{3} - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 \\neq 0$.\n- For $x = -2$: $p(-2) = (-2)^{3} - 2 = -8 - 2 = -10 \\neq 0$.\n\nSince none of the possible rational roots are actual roots of the polynomial, we conclude that $p(x) = x^{3} - 2$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$. As $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3$, its lack of roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$ implies that it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWe have now established three key properties for the polynomial $p(x) = x^{3} - 2$:\n1. It is a monic polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2. It has $α$ as a root, i.e., $p(α)=0$.\n3. It is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThese are precisely the defining properties of the minimal polynomial of $α$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.

The process must adhere to a specific methodology: deriving a polynomial by eliminating radicals through squaring, without first simplifying the expression for $α$, and then identifying the minimal polynomial from the factors of the derived polynomial.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The algebraic number is $α = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{8}$.\n- The definition of an algebraic number $α$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is provided: a root of a nonzero polynomial $P(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\n- The definition of the minimal polynomial $m_{α}(x)$ of $α$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is provided: the unique monic irreducible polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ of least degree for which $α$ is a root.\n- A procedural constraint is imposed: derive a polynomial $P(x)$ by isolating one radical at a time and squaring, without combining $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{8}$ beforehand.\n- The task requires factoring $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and identifying the minimal polynomial with justification.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is mathematically well-defined and self-contained. It is grounded in the established principles of abstract algebra and field theory. The concepts of algebraic numbers and minimal polynomials are standard. The prescribed method of eliminating radicals, while made artificially cumbersome by the non-simplification constraint, is a valid algebraic technique. This constraint serves a pedagogical purpose, forcing a demonstration of a general procedure. The problem is objective, free of ambiguity, and a unique solution exists. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed to Solution**\n\nWe begin by constructing a polynomial $P(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$ that has $α$ as a root. Let $x$ represent the number $α$.\n$$x = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{8}$$\nFollowing the instruction to isolate a single radical, we move $\\sqrt{2}$ to the left side of the equation:\n$$x - \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{8}$$\nNow, we square both sides to eliminate the radical on the right:\n$$(x - \\sqrt{2})^2 = (\\sqrt{8})^2$$\nExpanding the left side and simplifying the right side gives:\n$$x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$$\n$$x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 2 = 8$$\nNext, we isolate the term containing the remaining radical, $2\\sqrt{2}x$:\n$$x^2 - 6 = 2\\sqrt{2}x$$\nTo eliminate the last radical, we square both sides of the equation again:\n$$(x^2 - 6)^2 = (2\\sqrt{2}x)^2$$\nExpanding both sides yields:\n$$(x^2)^2 - 2(x^2)(6) + 6^2 = 2^2(\\sqrt{2})^2 x^2$$\n$$x^4 - 12x^2 + 36 = 4(2)x^2$$\n$$x^4 - 12x^2 + 36 = 8x^2$$\nFinally, we rearrange the terms to form a monic polynomial equation with rational coefficients:\n$$x^4 - 12x^2 - 8x^2 + 36 = 0$$\n$$x^4 - 20x^2 + 36 = 0$$\nThus, we have derived a monic polynomial $P(x) = x^4 - 20x^2 + 36$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $P(α) = 0$.\n\nThe next step is to factor $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ to find the minimal polynomial of $α$. The minimal polynomial, $m_{α}(x)$, must be an irreducible factor of any polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ for which $α$ is a root.\nThe polynomial $P(x)$ is a biquadratic polynomial. We can factor it by setting $y = x^2$:\n$$y^2 - 20y + 36 = 0$$\nWe seek two numbers that multiply to $36$ and sum to $-20$. These numbers are $-2$ and $-18$. So, the quadratic in $y$ factors as:\n$$(y - 2)(y - 18) = 0$$\nSubstituting $x^2$ back for $y$, we obtain the factorization of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$P(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 18)$$\nThe two factors are $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $f_2(x) = x^2 - 18$. Both are polynomials in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. We must check if they are irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A quadratic polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it has no rational roots.\n- The roots of $x^2 - 2 = 0$ are $x = \\pm\\sqrt{2}$, which are irrational. Thus, $x^2 - 2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n- The roots of $x^2 - 18 = 0$ are $x = \\pm\\sqrt{18} = \\pm 3\\sqrt{2}$, which are irrational. Thus, $x^2 - 18$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince the minimal polynomial $m_{α}(x)$ must be an irreducible factor of $P(x)$, it must be either $x^2 - 2$ or $x^2 - 18$. To determine which one, we must check which of these polynomials has $α = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{8}$ as a root.\n\nLet's test the first factor, $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$:\n$$f_1(α) = (\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{8})^2 - 2$$\n$$f_1(α) = ((\\sqrt{2})^2 + 2(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{8}) + (\\sqrt{8})^2) - 2$$\n$$f_1(α) = (2 + 2\\sqrt{16} + 8) - 2$$\n$$f_1(α) = (2 + 2(4) + 8) - 2$$\n$$f_1(α) = (10 + 8) - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16$$\nSince $f_1(α) = 16 \\neq 0$, $x^2 - 2$ is not the minimal polynomial of $α$.\n\nNow, let's test the second factor, $f_2(x) = x^2 - 18$:\n$$f_2(α) = (\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{8})^2 - 18$$\n$$f_2(α) = (2 + 2\\sqrt{16} + 8) - 18$$\n$$f_2(α) = (10 + 8) - 18 = 18 - 18 = 0$$\nSince $f_2(α) = 0$, $α$ is a root of $x^2 - 18$.\n\nWe now verify that $x^2 - 18$ satisfies all conditions for a minimal polynomial for $α = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{8}$:\n1.  **Monic:** The leading coefficient of $x^2 - 18$ is $1$. It is monic.\n2.  **In $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$:** The coefficients $1$, $0$, and $-18$ are all rational numbers.\n3.  **Root:** We have just shown that $α$ is a root of $x^2 - 18$.\n4.  **Irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$:** We have already established its irreducibility.\n5.  **Least Degree:** The degree of $x^2 - 18$ is $2$. If a polynomial of degree $1$, say $x-q$ where $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, had $α$ as a root, then $α$ would have to be equal to $q$, which means $α$ would be rational. However, $α = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$, which is an irrational number. Therefore, the degree of the minimal polynomial cannot be $1$. The degree must be at least $2$.\n\nThus, $x^2 - 18$ is the unique monic irreducible polynomial of least degree in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ having $α$ as a root. It is the minimal polynomial of $α = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{8}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x^2 - 18}\n$$", "id": "3087144"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves into more advanced territory by tackling the sum of two algebraic numbers with different root indices.

The solution involves two main parts: first, determining the degree of the minimal polynomial, and second, deriving a monic polynomial of that degree which has $α$ as a root.\n\nFirst, we will establish the degree of the minimal polynomial of $α$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is by definition the degree of the field extension $[\\mathbb{Q}(α):\\mathbb{Q}]$. We will use fundamental principles of field theory, namely the Tower Law for field extensions. The number $α$ is an element of the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2})$, which is the smallest field containing $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\sqrt[3]{2}$. Thus, the field $\\mathbb{Q}(α)$ generated by $α$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2})$.\n\nLet us determine the degree of the extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $m_{\\sqrt{2}}(x) = x^2 - 2$. This polynomial is monic, has rational coefficients, has $\\sqrt{2}$ as a root, and is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=2$. Therefore, the degree of the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(m_{\\sqrt{2}}(x)) = 2$.\n\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $m_{\\sqrt[3]{2}}(x) = x^3 - 2$. This polynomial is monic, has rational coefficients, has $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ as a root, and is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=2$. Therefore, the degree of the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(m_{\\sqrt[3]{2}}(x)) = 3$.\n\nBy the Tower Law, the degree of the composite field extension is given by:\n$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}]$.\nThe degree $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})]$ is the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The polynomial $x^3 - 2$ has $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ as a root. We must check if it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A cubic polynomial is reducible over a field if and only if it has a root in that field. Let us assume it has a root $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSubstituting this into the polynomial gives $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^3 = 2$.\nExpanding the left side yields $a^3 + 3a^2b\\sqrt{2} + 3a(b\\sqrt{2})^2 + (b\\sqrt{2})^3 = 2$, which simplifies to $(a^3+6ab^2) + (3a^2b+2b^3)\\sqrt{2} = 2$.\nSince $1$ and $\\sqrt{2}$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we can equate the rational and irrational parts:\n$a^3 + 6ab^2 = 2$\n$3a^2b + 2b^3 = 0$\nThe second equation can be factored as $b(3a^2+2b^2) = 0$. This implies either $b=0$ or $3a^2+2b^2=0$.\nIf $b=0$, the first equation becomes $a^3=2$, which has no solution for $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $3a^2+2b^2=0$, since $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, the only solution is $a=0$ and $b=0$. Substituting this into the first equation gives $0=2$, a contradiction.\nTherefore, $x^3-2$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and is thus irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $x^3-2$, and its degree is $3$.\nThus, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 3$.\nApplying the Tower Law, we find the degree of the composite extension:\n$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6$.\n\nSince the degrees of the extensions $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]=2$ and $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]=3$ are coprime, their product is the degree of the composite field, confirming our result.\n\nNow, we must show that $\\mathbb{Q}(α) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2})$.\nThe inclusion $\\mathbb{Q}(α) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2})$ is clear, as $α$ is formed from elements of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2})$. For the reverse inclusion, we must show that $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ are elements of $\\mathbb{Q}(α)$.\nLet $x = α = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt[3]{2}$. We manipulate this equation to express $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ in terms of $α$.\n$x - \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt[3]{2}$\nCubing both sides gives $(x - \\sqrt{2})^3 = 2$.\n$x^3 - 3x^2\\sqrt{2} + 3x(\\sqrt{2})^2 - (\\sqrt{2})^3 = 2$\n$x^3 - 3x^2\\sqrt{2} + 6x - 2\\sqrt{2} = 2$\nIsolating terms containing $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$x^3 + 6x - 2 = \\sqrt{2}(3x^2 + 2)$\nFrom this, we can express $\\sqrt{2}$ as a rational function of $x$:\n$\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{x^3 + 6x - 2}{3x^2 + 2}$\nSubstituting $α$ for $x$, we see that $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{α^3 + 6α - 2}{3α^2 + 2}$. Since $α = \\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is a positive real number, the denominator $3α^2+2$ is non-zero. This shows that $\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(α)$.\nFurthermore, since $\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(α)$, it follows that $\\sqrt[3]{2} = α - \\sqrt{2}$ is also an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(α)$.\nThis demonstrates that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(α)$.\nCombining both inclusions, we have established the equality $\\mathbb{Q}(α) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2})$.\nTherefore, the degree of the minimal polynomial of $α$ is:\n$[\\mathbb{Q}(α):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 6$.\nThis justifies from first principles why the degree of the minimal polynomial is $6$.\n\nNext, we derive the explicit form of the minimal polynomial, which we now know must be a monic polynomial of degree $6$. Let this polynomial be $p(x)$. We start from the equation derived earlier connecting $x$ and $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$x^3 + 6x - 2 = \\sqrt{2}(3x^2 + 2)$\nTo eliminate the radical $\\sqrt{2}$, we square both sides:\n$(x^3 + 6x - 2)^2 = 2(3x^2 + 2)^2$\nExpanding the left side:\n$(x^3)^2 + (6x)^2 + (-2)^2 + 2(x^3)(6x) + 2(x^3)(-2) + 2(6x)(-2) = x^6 + 36x^2 + 4 + 12x^4 - 4x^3 - 24x$.\nExpanding the right side:\n$2(9x^4 + 12x^2 + 4) = 18x^4 + 24x^2 + 8$.\nEquating the two expressions and collecting terms on one side yields:\n$x^6 + 12x^4 - 4x^3 + 36x^2 - 24x + 4 - (18x^4 + 24x^2 + 8) = 0$\n$x^6 + (12-18)x^4 - 4x^3 + (36-24)x^2 - 24x + (4-8) = 0$\n$x^6 - 6x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 24x - 4 = 0$\nWe have found a monic polynomial $p(x) = x^6 - 6x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 24x - 4$ with rational coefficients that has $α$ as a root.
