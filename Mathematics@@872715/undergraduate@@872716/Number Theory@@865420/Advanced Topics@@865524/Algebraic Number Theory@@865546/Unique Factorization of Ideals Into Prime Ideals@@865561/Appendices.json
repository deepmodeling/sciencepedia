The norm is defined as the size of the quotient ring, $N(I) \\coloneqq \\left|\\mathbb{Z}[i]/I\\right|$. We are instructed to use the identification of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ with the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nWe can view $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ as a free $\\mathbb{Z}$-module of rank $2$, with a basis given by $\\{1, i\\}$. Under this view, any element $x+yi \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ corresponds to the vector $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$. The entire ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ corresponds to the standard integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nThe principal ideal $I = (\\alpha) = \\alpha \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is the set of all elements of the form $\\alpha(x+yi)$ where $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This ideal is a $\\mathbb{Z}$-submodule of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. We can find a $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis for $I$ by multiplying the basis elements of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ by $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha \\cdot 1 = (a+bi) \\cdot 1 = a+bi $$\n$$ \\alpha \\cdot i = (a+bi) \\cdot i = ai + bi^2 = -b+ai $$\nIn the coordinate system corresponding to the basis $\\{1, i\\}$, these two basis vectors of the submodule $I$ are $(a, b)$ and $(-b, a)$. These vectors generate $I$ as a sublattice within the larger lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ (which corresponds to $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$).\n\nThe norm of the ideal, $N(I) = \\left|\\mathbb{Z}[i]/I\\right|$, is the index of the sublattice $I$ in the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. For a two-dimensional lattice, this index is given by the area of the fundamental parallelogram of the sublattice, assuming the fundamental parallelogram of the base lattice has area $1$. This area is computed as the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix whose columns (or rows) are the basis vectors of the sublattice.\n\nLet's form a matrix $M$ whose columns are the coordinate vectors of the basis of $I$:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & -b \\\\ b & a \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n$$ \\det(M) = a \\cdot a - (-b) \\cdot b = a^2 + b^2 $$\nThe index of the sublattice, and thus the norm of the ideal, is the absolute value of this determinant:\n$$ N((\\alpha)) = \\left|\\det(M)\\right| = |a^2 + b^2| $$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are real integers, $a^2 \\ge 0$ and $b^2 \\ge 0$, so their sum $a^2+b^2$ is always non-negative. Therefore, the absolute value is redundant. The general formula is:\n$$ N((a+bi)) = a^2 + b^2 $$\nThis is recognized as the field norm of the element $a+bi$, i.e., $N_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+bi) = (a+bi)(a-bi) = a^2+b^2$.\n\n(b) We are given $\\alpha = 3+4i$ and $\\beta = 2+i$. We will compute the specified norms using the formula derived in part (a).\n\nFor $\\alpha = 3+4i$, we have $a=3$ and $b=4$. The norm of the ideal $(\\alpha)$ is:\n$$ N((\\alpha)) = N((3+4i)) = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 $$\n\nFor $\\beta = 2+i$, we have $a=2$ and $b=1$. The norm of the ideal $(\\beta)$ is:\n$$ N((\\beta)) = N((2+i)) = 2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 $$\n\nNext, we compute the product $\\alpha\\beta$:\n$$ \\alpha\\beta = (3+4i)(2+i) = 6 + 3i + 8i + 4i^2 = (6-4) + (3+8)i = 2+11i $$\nThe norm of the ideal $(\\alpha\\beta)$ is then:\n$$ N((\\alpha\\beta)) = N((2+11i)) = 2^2 + 11^2 = 4 + 121 = 125 $$\n\nNow we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{N((\\alpha\\beta))}{N((\\alpha))\\,N((\\beta))} = \\frac{125}{25 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{125}{125} = 1 $$\nThis explicitly verifies that $N((\\alpha\\beta)) = N((\\alpha))N((\\beta))$ for the given $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nThe observed multiplicativity, $N(IJ)=N(I)N(J)$, is a fundamental property of the ideal norm in any Dedekind domain. The ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Dedekind domain (in fact, it's a principal ideal domain, which is a stronger condition). For principal ideals, the product of ideals corresponds to the ideal of the product of their generators: $(\\alpha)(\\beta) = (\\alpha\\beta)$. Thus, the general property $N((\\alpha)(\\beta)) = N((\\alpha))N((\\beta))$ becomes $N((\\alpha\\beta)) = N((\\alpha))N((\\beta))$.\n\nThis property stems from the fact that the ideal norm for a principal ideal $(\\alpha)$, $N((\\alpha))$, is equal to the absolute value of the field norm of its generator, $|N_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|$. The field norm is itself multiplicative, i.e., $N_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha\\beta) = N_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)N_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)$. This can be seen from its definition as the determinant of the multiplication-by-element map or more simply by:\n$$ N_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha\\beta) = (\\alpha\\beta)\\overline{(\\alpha\\beta)} = (\\alpha\\beta)(\\overline{\\alpha}\\overline{\\beta}) = (\\alpha\\overline{\\alpha})(\\beta\\overline{\\beta}) = N_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)N_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta) $$\nSince the field norms are non-negative in this case ($a^2+b^2 \\ge 0$), the multiplicativity of the ideal norm is a direct consequence. This property is crucial for the theory of unique factorization of ideals into prime ideals. In a Dedekind domain, any nonzero proper ideal $I$ has a unique factorization $I = \\mathfrak{p}_1^{e_1} \\dots \\mathfrak{p}_k^{e_k}$ into a product of prime ideals. The multiplicative nature of the norm implies $N(I) = N(\\mathfrak{p}_1)^{e_1} \\dots N(\\mathfrak{p}_k)^{e_k}$, which allows the computation of any ideal norm to be reduced to computing norms of prime ideals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{a^2+b^2}$$", "id": "3093808"}, {"introduction": "With the ideal norm as our tool, we can now tackle the central theme: the factorization of ideals.

The solution is presented in three parts as requested.\n\n(a) Classification of prime factorization in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$\n\nThe factorization of the ideal $(p)=p\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ for a rational prime $p$ is determined by the factorization of the polynomial $f(x)=x^2+1$ modulo $p$. This is a direct application of the Dedekind-Kummer theorem.\n\nCase 1: $p$ is an odd prime.\nThe ideal $(p)$ splits if $x^2+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ has two distinct roots. This is equivalent to asserting that $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. The existence of such roots is determined by the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{-1}{p})$. We know from elementary number theory that $(\\frac{-1}{p}) = (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$.\n- If $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ is an even integer, so $(\\frac{-1}{p})=1$. Thus, $x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ has two distinct solutions.

Thus, $x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ has no solutions. The polynomial $x^2+1$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$. In this case, the prime $p$ is inert in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, meaning the ideal $(p)$ remains a prime ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nCase 2: $p=2$.\nWe examine the polynomial $x^2+1$ modulo $2$. We have $x^2+1 \\equiv x^2-1 \\equiv (x-1)^2 \\pmod{2}$. The polynomial has a repeated root at $x=1$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This corresponds to the case of ramification.

We seek a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ such that $(2) = \\mathfrak{p}^2$. Let's consider the element $1+i \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$. The ideal it generates is $\\mathfrak{p}=(1+i)$. The square of this ideal is $(1+i)^2$, which is generated by $(1+i)^2 = 1^2 + 2i + i^2 = 1+2i-1=2i$. Since $i$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, the ideal $(2i)$ is the same as the ideal $(2)$. Thus, $(2) = (1+i)^2$. The ideal $(1+i)$ is prime because its norm, $N((1+i))$, which is the norm of its generator $1+i$, is $1^2+1^2=2$, and $2$ is a prime number. An ideal with a prime norm must be a prime ideal.\n\n- For $p=3$: Since $3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the prime $3$ is inert. This means the ideal $(3)$ is a prime ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. To verify this, we can show that the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]/(3)$ is an integral domain, and therefore a field since it's finite.\n$\\mathbb{Z}[i]/(3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2+1, 3) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})[x]/(x^2+1) = \\mathbb{F}_3[x]/(x^2+1)$.\nThe polynomial $x^2+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3$ because it has degree $2$ and no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3$: $0^2+1=1 \\neq 0$, $1^2+1=2 \\neq 0$, and $2^2+1=5 \\equiv 2 \\neq 0$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]/(x^2+1)$ is a field. This implies that $(3)$ is a maximal ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, and hence a prime ideal.\n\n- For $p=5$: Since $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, the prime $5$ splits. We need to find integers $a, b$ such that $a^2+b^2=5$. A solution is $a=1, b=2$ (or $a=2, b=1$). Let's take the generator $1+2i$. The factorization of the ideal $(5)$ is given by $(5)=(1+2i)(1-2i)$. This equality holds because the product of the generators is $(1+2i)(1-2i) = 1^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - 4i^2 = 1+4=5$. The ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_1=(1+2i)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2=(1-2i)$ are prime because their norms are $N(\\mathfrak{p}_1) = 1^2+2^2=5$ and $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = 1^2+(-2)^2=5$, both of which are prime numbers.\n\n- For $p=13$: Since $13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, the prime $13$ splits. We seek integers $a, b$ such that $a^2+b^2=13$. A solution is $a=2, b=3$. The factorization of the ideal $(13)$ is given by $(13)=(2+3i)(2-3i)$. The product of generators is $(2+3i)(2-3i) = 2^2 - (3i)^2 = 4 - 9i^2 = 4+9=13$. The ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_1=(2+3i)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2=(2-3i)$ are prime since their norms are $N(\\mathfrak{p}_1)=2^2+3^2=13$ and $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2)=2^2+(-3)^2=13$, which is a prime number.\n\n(c) Computation of the product of norms\n\nFirst, we must identify the set $\\mathcal{P}$ of all distinct prime ideals lying above the primes $\\{2,3,5,13\\}$.

The only distinct prime ideal factor is $\\mathfrak{p}_2=(1+i)$.\n- For $p=3$, the factorization is $(3)$, which is itself a prime ideal. The prime ideal is $\\mathfrak{p}_3=(3)$.\n- For $p=5$, the factorization is $(5)=(1+2i)(1-2i)$. The prime ideal factors are $\\mathfrak{p}_{5,1}=(1+2i)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_{5,2}=(1-2i)$. These are distinct ideals, as $1+2i \\neq u(1-2i)$ for any unit $u \\in \\{\\pm 1, \\pm i\\}$.\n- For $p=13$, the factorization is $(13)=(2+3i)(2-3i)$. The prime ideal factors are $\\mathfrak{p}_{13,1}=(2+3i)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_{13,2}=(2-3i)$. These are also distinct ideals.\n\nSo, the set of distinct prime ideals is $\\mathcal{P} = \\{ (1+i), (3), (1+2i), (1-2i), (2+3i), (2-3i) \\}$.\n\nNext, we compute the norm of each of these prime ideals.

We proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a primary decomposition of the ideal $I = (x^2, xy)$ in the polynomial ring $R = k[x,y]$, where $k$ is a field.\n\nFirst, we analyze the ideal $I$ itself. The generators of $I$ are $x^2$ and $xy$. We can factor out $x$ to write $I = (x)(x,y)$, which is a product of two ideals. While this is suggestive, the product of ideals is generally not their intersection. We seek an expression for $I$ as an intersection of primary ideals.\n\nLet us propose a candidate decomposition and then verify it. A natural candidate decomposition is $I = (x) \\cap (x^2, y)$. We will now prove this equality by demonstrating inclusion in both directions.\n\n**Part 1: Proving the decomposition $I = (x) \\cap (x^2, y)$**\n\n**Inclusion 1: $I \\subseteq (x) \\cap (x^2, y)$**\nLet $f$ be an arbitrary element of $I = (x^2, xy)$. By definition, $f$ can be written as $f = a(x,y)x^2 + b(x,y)xy$ for some polynomials $a(x,y), b(x,y) \\in R$.\nWe can factor this expression as $f = x(a(x,y)x + b(x,y)y)$. This shows that $f$ is a multiple of $x$, so $f \\in (x)$.\nFurthermore, we can write $f = x^2(a(x,y)) + y(x b(x,y))$. This shows that $f$ is a linear combination of $x^2$ and $y$ with polynomial coefficients in $R$, which means $f \\in (x^2, y)$.\nSince any element $f \\in I$ belongs to both $(x)$ and $(x^2, y)$, we conclude that $I \\subseteq (x) \\cap (x^2, y)$.\n\n**Inclusion 2: $(x) \\cap (x^2, y) \\subseteq I$**\nLet $g$ be an arbitrary element of $(x) \\cap (x^2, y)$.\nSince $g \\in (x)$, we can write $g = h(x,y)x$ for some polynomial $h(x,y) \\in R$.\nSince $g \\in (x^2, y)$, we can also write $g = p(x,y)x^2 + q(x,y)y$ for some polynomials $p(x,y), q(x,y) \\in R$.\nEquating these two expressions for $g$, we have $h(x,y)x = p(x,y)x^2 + q(x,y)y$.\nRearranging the terms gives $q(x,y)y = h(x,y)x - p(x,y)x^2 = x(h(x,y) - p(x,y)x)$.\nThis equation shows that the polynomial $q(x,y)y$ is divisible by $x$. The ring $R=k[x,y]$ is a unique factorization domain, and the elements $x$ and $y$ are distinct irreducible polynomials (and thus coprime). Therefore, if $x$ divides the product $q(x,y)y$, it must divide the factor $q(x,y)$.\nSo, we can write $q(x,y) = s(x,y)x$ for some polynomial $s(x,y) \\in R$.\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for $g$ from its membership in $(x^2, y)$:\n$g = p(x,y)x^2 + (s(x,y)x)y = p(x,y)x^2 + s(x,y)xy$.\nThis expression shows $g$ as a linear combination of $x^2$ and $xy$ with polynomial coefficients. Hence, by definition, $g \\in (x^2, xy) = I$.\nSince any element $g \\in (x) \\cap (x^2, y)$ also belongs to $I$, we conclude that $(x) \\cap (x^2, y) \\subseteq I$.\n\nHaving shown inclusion in both directions, we have established the equality $I = (x) \\cap (x^2, y)$.\n\n**Part 2: Verifying the components are primary**\n\nLet $Q_1 = (x)$ and $Q_2 = (x^2, y)$. We must verify that both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are primary ideals.\n\n**Component $Q_1 = (x)$:**\nThe quotient ring $R/Q_1 = k[x,y]/(x)$ is isomorphic to $k[y]$. Since $k$ is a field, $k[y]$ is a polynomial ring in one variable over a field, which is an integral domain. An ideal $J$ is prime if and only if the quotient ring $R/J$ is an integral domain. Thus, $Q_1 = (x)$ is a prime ideal.\nEvery prime ideal $P$ is, by definition, $P$-primary. To see this, first $\\sqrt{P} = P$. Second, if $ab \\in P$ and $a \\notin P$, the definition of a prime ideal requires that $b \\in P$, so $b^1 \\in P$. Thus, the condition for being primary is satisfied.\nTherefore, $Q_1 = (x)$ is an $(x)$-primary ideal.\n\n**Component $Q_2 = (x^2, y)$:**\nAn ideal $Q$ is primary if and only if in the quotient ring $R/Q$, every zero-divisor is nilpotent.\nLet us analyze the quotient ring $R/Q_2 = k[x,y]/(x^2, y)$. This ring is isomorphic to $(k[x,y]/(y))/( (x^2,y)/(y) ) \\cong k[x]/(x^2)$.\nThe elements of $k[x]/(x^2)$ are of the form $a+b\\bar{x}$, where $a,b \\in k$ and $\\bar{x}$ is the image of $x$. An element $a+b\\bar{x}$ is a zero-divisor if it is non-zero and there exists a non-zero $c+d\\bar{x}$ such that $(a+b\\bar{x})(c+d\\bar{x}) = 0$. This product is $ac + (ad+bc)\\bar{x}$. This equals $0$ in $k[x]/(x^2)$ if and only if $ac=0$ and $ad+bc=0$.\nThe units in $k[x]/(x^2)$ are the elements $a+b\\bar{x}$ with $a \\neq 0$. The zero-divisors are the non-zero, non-unit elements. These are the elements where $a=0$ and $b \\neq 0$, i.e., elements of the form $b\\bar{x}$ for $b \\in k \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nWe check if these zero-divisors are nilpotent. The square of such an element is $(b\\bar{x})^2 = b^2\\bar{x}^2$. Since $\\bar{x}^2=0$ in the quotient ring, we have $(b\\bar{x})^2 = 0$. Thus, every zero-divisor is nilpotent.\nThis confirms that $Q_2 = (x^2, y)$ is a primary ideal.\n\nNext, we find its radical, $P_2 = \\sqrt{Q_2}$. The radical of $Q_2$ corresponds to the nilradical of the quotient ring $R/Q_2 \\cong k[x]/(x^2)$. The nilpotent elements in $k[x]/(x^2)$ are precisely the multiples of $\\bar{x}$, which form the ideal $(\\bar{x})$. Pulling this back to $R$, the radical of $Q_2=(x^2,y)$ is the ideal $(x,y)$. So $P_2 = (x,y)$.\nThe ideal $P_2 = (x,y)$ is maximal in $k[x,y]$ (since $R/P_2 \\cong k$, a field), and therefore it is a prime ideal.\nThus, $Q_2 = (x^2, y)$ is an $(x,y)$-primary ideal.\n\nThe decomposition $I = (x) \\cap (x^2, y)$ is a finite intersection of primary ideals, so it is a primary decomposition. It is minimal because the radicals $P_1=(x)$ and $P_2=(x,y)$ are distinct, and neither $Q_1$ nor $Q_2$ is redundant (i.e., $Q_1 \\not\\subseteq Q_2$ and $Q_2 \\not\\subseteq Q_1$).\n\n**Part 3: Contrast with Dedekind domains**\n\nThe problem requires an explanation of why one component is not a power of a prime ideal. This illustrates a key difference between general Noetherian rings like $k[x,y]$ and Dedekind domains. In a Dedekind domain, every primary ideal is a power of its associated prime ideal.\n\nLet us examine our primary components:\n1.  $Q_1 = (x)$. Its radical is $P_1 = (x)$. Here, $Q_1 = P_1^1$. This component is a power (the first power) of a prime ideal.\n2.  $Q_2 = (x^2, y)$. Its radical is the prime ideal $P_2 = (x,y)$. Let us check if $Q_2$ is a power of $P_2$.\n    -   $P_2^1 = (x,y)$. Clearly $Q_2 \\neq P_2^1$, as $y \\in Q_2$ but $x \\notin Q_2$.\n    -   $P_2^2 = (x,y)^2 = (x^2, xy, y^2)$. We check if $Q_2 = P_2^2$. The element $y$ is in $Q_2 = (x^2, y)$. However, $y \\notin P_2^2 = (x^2, xy, y^2)$. To see this, assume $y = f x^2 + g xy + h y^2$ for some $f,g,h \\in R$. Evaluating at $x=0$, we get $y = h(0,y)y^2$. Since $R=k[x,y]$ is an integral domain, we can divide by $y$ to obtain $1 = h(0,y)y$. This is impossible in the polynomial ring $k[y]$ as the degree of the right side is at least $1$ while the degree of the left side is $0$. Therefore, $y \\notin P_2^2$, and so $Q_2 \\neq P_2^2$.\n    -   For any integer $n \\ge 2$, the ideal $P_2^n = (x,y)^n$ is generated by homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$. The element $y \\in Q_2$ has degree $1$ and thus cannot belong to any $P_2^n$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n\nTherefore, the primary ideal $Q_2 = (x^2, y)$ is not a power of its radical $P_2 = (x,y)$. This demonstrates that in the ring $k[x,y]$, which is not a Dedekind domain (its Krull dimension is $2$), there exist primary ideals that are not powers of prime ideals. This stands in sharp contrast to the situation in Dedekind domains, where the factorization of ideals into prime ideals is much simpler and more direct.\n\nThe final derived primary decomposition is the intersection expression found in Part 1.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{(x) \\cap (x^2, y)} $$", "id": "3093782"}]}
