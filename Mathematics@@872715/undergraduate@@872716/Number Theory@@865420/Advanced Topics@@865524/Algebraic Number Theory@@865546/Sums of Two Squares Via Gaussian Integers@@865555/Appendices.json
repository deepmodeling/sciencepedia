The Euclidean algorithm can be applied directly. We will denote $z_1 = 7+5i$ and $z_2 = 3+8i$.\n\nFirst, we compare their norms:\n$N(z_1) = N(7+5i) = 7^2 + 5^2 = 49 + 25 = 74$.\n$N(z_2) = N(3+8i) = 3^2 + 8^2 = 9 + 64 = 73$.\nSince $N(z_1)  N(z_2)$, we will divide $z_1$ by $z_2$.\n\nStep 1: Divide $z_1$ by $z_2$.\nTo find the quotient $q_1$ and remainder $r_1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that $z_1 = q_1 z_2 + r_1$ with $N(r_1)  N(z_2)$, we first compute the quotient in $\\mathbb{C}$:\n$$ \\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{7+5i}{3+8i} = \\frac{(7+5i)(3-8i)}{(3+8i)(3-8i)} = \\frac{21 - 56i + 15i - 40i^2}{3^2+8^2} = \\frac{61 - 41i}{73} = \\frac{61}{73} - \\frac{41}{73}i $$\nThe nearest Gaussian integer to this complex number is found by rounding the real and imaginary parts to the nearest integers.\n$\\text{round}(\\frac{61}{73}) \\approx \\text{round}(0.835) = 1$.\n$\\text{round}(-\\frac{41}{73}) \\approx \\text{round}(-0.561) = -1$.\nSo, we choose the quotient $q_1 = 1-i$.\n\nNow, we calculate the remainder $r_1$:\n$$ r_1 = z_1 - q_1 z_2 = (7+5i) - (1-i)(3+8i) $$\n$$ r_1 = (7+5i) - (3+8i-3i-8i^2) = (7+5i) - (3+5i+8) = (7+5i) - (11+5i) = -4 $$\nThe first division equation is $7+5i = (1-i)(3+8i) - 4$.\nWe check the norm of the remainder: $N(r_1) = N(-4) = (-4)^2 = 16$. This satisfies the condition $N(r_1)  N(z_2)$, as $16  73$.\n\nStep 2: Divide $z_2$ by $r_1$.\nNow we divide $z_2 = 3+8i$ by the remainder $r_1 = -4$.\n$$ \\frac{z_2}{r_1} = \\frac{3+8i}{-4} = -\\frac{3}{4} - 2i $$\nRounding the real and imaginary parts to the nearest integers:\n$\\text{round}(-\\frac{3}{4}) = \\text{round}(-0.75) = -1$.\n$\\text{round}(-2) = -2$.\nSo, we choose the quotient $q_2 = -1-2i$.\n\nNow, we calculate the new remainder $r_2$:\n$$ r_2 = z_2 - q_2 r_1 = (3+8i) - (-1-2i)(-4) = (3+8i) - (4+8i) = -1 $$\nThe second division equation is $3+8i = (-1-2i)(-4) - 1$.\nWe check the norm of the remainder: $N(r_2) = N(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1$.

The procedure is broken down into distinct steps, which we shall follow rigorously.\n\nThe foundational principle is that an odd prime integer $p$ can be written as the sum of two squares if and only if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. If this condition holds, $p$ is no longer a prime element in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ but factors as $p = \\pi \\bar{\\pi}$ for some Gaussian prime $\\pi = a+bi$. Taking the norm of this equation gives $N(p) = N(\\pi)N(\\bar{\\pi})$. Since $p$ is a real integer, $N(p) = p^2$. The norm of $\\pi=a+bi$ is $N(\\pi) = a^2+b^2$ and $N(\\bar{\\pi}) = a^2+(-b)^2 = a^2+b^2$. Thus, $p^2 = (a^2+b^2)^2$, which implies $p=a^2+b^2$. The problem guides us through finding such a factor $\\pi$.\n\nFirst, we check the condition for the prime $p=41$. We have $41 = 4 \\times 10 + 1$, so $41 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.

We will proceed with $x=9$.\n\nStep 2: Compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $41$ and $x+i=9+i$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm for Gaussian integers. The norm in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is $N(a+bi) = a^2+b^2$. We will perform division with remainder.\nFirst, we divide $41$ by $9+i$.

Thus, the problem is equivalent to finding all Gaussian integers $\\alpha$ such that $N(\\alpha)=130$, and from them, deriving the unique pairs of non-negative integers $(a,b)$ with $a \\ge b$.\n\nFirst, we must determine if such a representation exists. The problem provides the key fact that a rational prime $p$ is reducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ if and only if $p=2$ or $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. A cornerstone theorem in number theory, which follows from these properties, states that a positive integer $n$ can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if the prime factorization of $n$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$ contains no prime of the form $4k+3$ raised to an odd power.\n\nLet's find the prime factorization of $130$ in the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$:\n$$130 = 10 \\times 13 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 13$$\nThe prime factors are $2$, $5$, and $13$.\n- The prime $2$ is the special case mentioned in the given rule.\n- The prime $5$ satisfies $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n- The prime $13$ satisfies $13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe prime factorization of $130$ does not contain any prime factor of the form $4k+3$. Therefore, $130$ can be expressed as a sum of two squares.\n\nTo find all such representations, we leverage the fact that $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD). We need to find the prime factorization of $130$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. This involves factoring its rational prime factors ($2$, $5$, $13$) into Gaussian primes.\n\n1.  Factoring $2$: $2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = (1+i)(1-i)$. In $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, the primes $1+i$ and $1-i$ are associates, since $1-i = (-i)(1+i)$. The norm is $N(1+i) = 1^2+1^2=2$.\n2.  Factoring $5$: Since $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, it is reducible. We find by inspection that $5 = 2^2+1^2$. This gives the factorization $5 = (2+i)(2-i)$. The factors $2+i$ and $2-i$ are Gaussian primes because their norm is $5$, a rational prime. They are not associates, as $\\frac{2+i}{2-i} = \\frac{(2+i)^2}{5} = \\frac{3+4i}{5}$, which is not a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n3.  Factoring $13$: Since $13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, it is reducible. We find by inspection that $13=3^2+2^2$. This gives the factorization $13 = (3+2i)(3-2i)$. The factors $3+2i$ and $3-2i$ are Gaussian primes because their norm is $13$, a rational prime. They are not associates.\n\nCombining these, the prime factorization of $130$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is:\n$$130 = (1+i)(1-i)(2+i)(2-i)(3+2i)(3-2i)$$\nWe are looking for $\\alpha = a+bi$ such that $N(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\bar{\\alpha} = 130$. By the unique factorization property, the prime factors of $\\alpha$ must be chosen from the set of prime factors of $130$.

This representation corresponds to the sum $9^2+7^2=130$. The canonical pair is $(9,7)$.\n\nCase 3: $\\alpha_3 = (1+i)(2-i)(3+2i)$\nFirst, $(1+i)(2-i) = 2-i+2i-i^2 = 3+i$.\nThen, $\\alpha_3 = (3+i)(3+2i) = 9+6i+3i+2i^2 = 9+9i-2 = 7+9i$.\nThe norm is $N(\\alpha_3) = 7^2+9^2=49+81=130$. This gives the sum $7^2+9^2=130$, which corresponds to the same canonical pair $(9,7)$ as in Case 2.\n\nCase 4: $\\alpha_4 = (1+i)(2-i)(3-2i)$\nUsing $(1+i)(2-i)=3+i$ from above,\n$\\alpha_4 = (3+i)(3-2i) = 9-6i+3i-2i^2 = 9-3i+2 = 11-3i$.\nThe norm is $N(\\alpha_4) = 11^2+(-3)^2=121+9=130$. This gives the sum $11^2+3^2=130$, corresponding to the same canonical pair $(11,3)$ as in Case 1.\n\nThe other possible choices for the factors (e.g., starting with $1-i$ instead of $1+i$) will yield Gaussian integers that are conjugates or associates of the ones calculated above, thus resulting in the same pairs of squares.\nFor example, $(1-i)(2-i)(3-2i) = \\overline{(1+i)(2+i)(3+2i)} = \\overline{-3+11i} = -3-11i$, which still gives the sum $(-3)^2+(-11)^2=130$.\n\nThe distinct pairs $(a,b)$ of non-negative integers with $a \\ge b$ such that $a^2+b^2=130$ are therefore $(11,3)$ and $(9,7)$.\nThe problem asks for a single row matrix concatenating these pairs.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n11  3  9  7\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3090046"}]}
