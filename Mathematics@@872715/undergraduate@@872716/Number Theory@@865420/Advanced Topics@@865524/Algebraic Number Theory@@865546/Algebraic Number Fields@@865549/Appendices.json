An element $\\alpha$ of a field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if it is a root of some nonzero polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the unique monic irreducible polynomial $m_{\\alpha}(x)\\in\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ of smallest degree such that $m_{\\alpha}(\\alpha)=0$. The degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is the dimension of $L$ as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Tower Law states that if $\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq F\\subseteq L$ are fields, then $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=[L:F]\\cdot[F:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n\nStep $1$: Find a polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ satisfied by $\\alpha=\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$. Set $x=\\alpha$. Then\n$$\nx^{2}=(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})^{2}=2+3+2\\sqrt{6}=5+2\\sqrt{6}.\n$$\nIsolating the radical yields\n$$\n\\sqrt{6}=\\frac{x^{2}-5}{2}.\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives\n$$\n6=\\left(\\frac{x^{2}-5}{2}\\right)^{2} \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad (x^{2}-5)^{2}=24.\n$$\nExpanding and simplifying,\n$$\nx^{4}-10x^{2}+25=24 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x^{4}-10x^{2}+1=0.\n$$\nThus $\\alpha$ is a root of the quartic polynomial $f(x)=x^{4}-10x^{2}+1\\in\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\n\nStep $2$: Show that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and hence is the minimal polynomial. Since $f(x)$ has even powers only and is monic, any factorization over $\\mathbb{Q}$ would be into two quadratics or would involve a linear factor. The Rational Root Theorem (a well-tested fact) rules out linear factors because $f(x)$ has no rational roots: if $x\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ and $f(x)=0$, then $x$ would be of the form $\\pm 1$, but $f(\\pm 1)=1-10+1=-8\\neq 0$.\n\nIf $f(x)$ had a quadratic factor with $\\alpha$ as a root, then the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ would have degree $2$, implying $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ is a quadratic field. Because $\\alpha\\in K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$, any quadratic subfield containing $\\alpha$ must be one of the quadratic subfields of $K$, which are $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. We now show $\\alpha$ does not lie in any of these three.\n\n- Suppose $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Then there exist $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}=a+b\\sqrt{2}$, so $\\sqrt{3}=a+(b-1)\\sqrt{2}$. Squaring both sides yields\n$$\n3=a^{2}+2a(b-1)\\sqrt{2}+2(b-1)^{2}.\n$$\nThis implies $2a(b-1)\\sqrt{2}$ is rational, so either $a=0$ or $b=1$. If $a=0$, then $3=2(b-1)^{2}$, which gives $b-1=\\pm\\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{2}}\\notin\\mathbb{Q}$. If $b=1$, then $3=a^{2}$, so $a=\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\notin\\mathbb{Q}$. Both cases contradict $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, hence $\\alpha\\notin\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n- By symmetry, $\\alpha\\notin\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n- Suppose $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. Then there exist $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}=a+b\\sqrt{6}$. Squaring both sides gives\n$$\n5+2\\sqrt{6}=a^{2}+2ab\\sqrt{6}+6b^{2}.\n$$\nEquating the rational and $\\sqrt{6}$ parts,\n$$\n5=a^{2}+6b^{2},\\qquad 2=2ab\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad ab=1.\n$$\nHence $a\\neq 0$ and $b=\\frac{1}{a}$. Substituting into $5=a^{2}+6b^{2}$ yields $5=a^{2}+6\\frac{1}{a^{2}}$, so $a^{4}-5a^{2}+6=0$, i.e.,\n$$\n(a^{2}-2)(a^{2}-3)=0.\n$$\nThus $a^{2}\\in\\{2,3\\}$, which forces $a\\notin\\mathbb{Q}$, contradicting $a\\in\\mathbb{Q}$. Hence $\\alpha\\notin\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$.\n\nTherefore $\\alpha$ is not in any quadratic subfield of $K$, so its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ cannot have degree $2$. Since $f(x)$ is quartic and has $\\alpha$ as a root, and $f(x)$ has no rational root, it cannot factor with a linear factor; if it factored into two quadratics, one would be the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$, contradicting the above. Hence $f(x)$ is irreducible and equals the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$\nm_{\\alpha}(x)=x^{4}-10x^{2}+1.\n$$\n\nStep $3$: Deduce the degree $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. First, note that $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]=2$. We claim that $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})]=2$. Indeed, if $\\sqrt{3}\\in\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, there would exist $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\sqrt{3}=a+b\\sqrt{2}$. Squaring and comparing rational and $\\sqrt{2}$ parts leads to the same contradiction as above. Thus $\\sqrt{3}\\notin\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so adjoining $\\sqrt{3}$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ produces a quadratic extension. By the Tower Law,\n$$\n[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})]\\cdot[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]=2\\cdot 2=4.\n$$\n\nIn summary, the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha=\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^{4}-10x^{2}+1$, and the degree of the extension $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}x^{4}-10x^{2}+1 & 4\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3080445"}, {"introduction": "A central object of study in an algebraic number field $K$ is its ring of integers, $\\mathcal{O}_K$.

This requires a systematic application of foundational concepts in algebraic number theory. The problem is valid as it is mathematically well-defined, self-contained, and grounded in established theory.\n\nFirst, we identify the properties of the field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$. This is a quadratic number field of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d=-5$. Since $d$ is square-free and $d=-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers of $K$ is $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$. Elements of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ are of the form $a+b\\sqrt{-5}$ for integers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe degree of the extension is $n=[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2$.\n\nStep 1: Determine the signature $(r_{1}, r_{2})$ of $K$.\nThe embeddings of $K$ into the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ are determined by the roots of the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{-5}$, which is $x^2+5=0$. The roots are $\\sigma_1(\\sqrt{-5}) = i\\sqrt{5}$ and $\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{-5}) = -i\\sqrt{5}$. Since both roots are non-real, there are no real embeddings, so $r_1=0$. There is one pair of complex conjugate embeddings, so $r_2=1$. The signature is thus $(r_1, r_2) = (0, 1)$. We can verify that $n = r_1 + 2r_2 = 0 + 2(1) = 2$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the discriminant $D_{K}$ of $K$.\nFor a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d$ square-free, the discriminant $D_K$ is given by $d$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $4d$ if $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, we have $d=-5$, which satisfies $-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Therefore, the discriminant is $D_K = 4d = 4(-5) = -20$.\n\nStep 3: Compute Minkowski's bound $M_{K}$.\nMinkowski's bound is a critical tool that provides an upper bound on the norm of an ideal in each ideal class. The formula is:\n$$M_{K} = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\frac{n!}{n^n} |D_{K}|^{1/2}$$\nSubstituting the values we have found: $n=2$, $r_2=1$, and $|D_K|=20$.\n$$M_{K} = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{1} \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\sqrt{20} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{5} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{\\pi}$$\nTo use this bound effectively, we approximate its numerical value. Using $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$ and $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23607$:\n$$M_{K} \\approx \\frac{4 \\times 2.23607}{3.14159} \\approx \\frac{8.94428}{3.14159} \\approx 2.847$$\nMinkowski's theorem guarantees that every ideal class in the class group of $K$ contains an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ with norm $N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\leq M_K$. Since $M_K \\approx 2.847$, we need to examine prime ideals whose norm is a prime number $p \\leq M_K$. The only such prime is $p=2$.\n\nStep 4: Analyze ideals with norm bounded by $M_K$.\nThe class group $\\text{Cl}(K)$ is generated by the classes of prime ideals of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm less than or equal to $M_K$.\nThe only integral ideals with norm $1$ is $\\mathcal{O}_K = (1)$, which is the principal ideal representing the identity element of the class group.\nWe must investigate ideals of norm $2$. These must be prime ideals lying above the rational prime $p=2$. We use the Dedekind-Kummer theorem to factor the ideal $(2)\\mathcal{O}_K$. We consider the minimal polynomial $f(x) = x^2+5$ of the generator $\\sqrt{-5}$ of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module, and reduce it modulo $2$:\n$$x^2+5 \\equiv x^2+1 \\equiv (x+1)^2 \\pmod{2}$$\nSince the polynomial factors into a repeated linear factor, the prime $2$ is ramified in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The factorization of the ideal $(2)$ is $(2) = \\mathfrak{p}_2^2$, where $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is a prime ideal given by $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$. The norm of this ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = \\sqrt{N((2))} = \\sqrt{2^2} = 2$.\n\nStep 5: Determine if $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is principal and find the class number $h_K$.\nThe class group is generated by the ideal class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$. To determine the structure of the class group, we must test if $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is a principal ideal. If $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ were principal, there would exist an element $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\alpha)$. The norm of such an element must equal the norm of the ideal:\n$$N(\\alpha) = N(a+b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 - (-5)b^2 = a^2+5b^2$$\nWe would require $N(\\alpha) = N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = 2$. So we must check if the Diophantine equation $a^2+5b^2=2$ has integer solutions for $a$ and $b$.\nIf $b=0$, we have $a^2=2$, which has no integer solution for $a$.\nIf $b \\neq 0$, then $|b| \\geq 1$, which implies $b^2 \\geq 1$. In this case, $5b^2 \\geq 5$. Since $a^2 \\geq 0$, we have $a^2+5b^2 \\geq 5 > 2$.\nThus, there are no integer solutions $(a, b)$ to the equation $a^2+5b^2=2$. This demonstrates that there is no element in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $2$. Consequently, the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ cannot be principal.\nThis means its class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is a non-trivial element of the class group. Therefore, the class number $h_K > 1$.\n\nThe class group is generated by $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$. We now find the order of this element. Consider the ideal class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = [\\mathfrak{p}_2^2]$. From the factorization of $(2)$, we have $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2 = (2)$. The ideal $(2)$ is a principal ideal generated by the integer $2$. Therefore, its class is the identity element in the class group:\n$$[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = [\\mathfrak{p}_2^2] = [(2)] = [1]$$\nThis shows that the element $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ has order $2$. Since the class group is generated by an element of order $2$, the group itself must be a cyclic group of order $2$. The elements of the class group are $[(1)]$ (the class of principal ideals) and $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$.\nThe class number $h_K$ is the order of the class group. Therefore, $h_K=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3080401"}]}
