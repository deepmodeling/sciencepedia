The definition is given as an infinite product:\n$$ (q;q)_{\\infty} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q^n) = (1-q)(1-q^2)(1-q^3)\\cdots $$\nWe are asked to find the polynomial $S_{15}(q)$ such that $(q;q)_{\\infty} = S_{15}(q) + \\mathcal{O}(q^{16})$. This polynomial is the Taylor expansion of the infinite product truncated at degree $15$.\n\nThe formal expansion of the product follows from the generalized distributive law. A term in the expansion is formed by choosing, from each factor $(1-q^n)$, either the term $1$ or the term $-q^n$. To obtain a term of the form $c_k q^k$, we must select a finite number of factors, say $-q^{n_1}, -q^{n_2}, \\dots, -q^{n_j}$, and the term $1$ from all other factors, such that the sum of the exponents is $k$:\n$$ n_1 + n_2 + \\dots + n_j = k $$\nSince each factor $(1-q^n)$ can be used at most once, the integers $n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_j$ must be distinct. The product of these chosen terms is $(-1)^j q^{n_1+n_2+\\dots+n_j} = (-1)^j q^k$.\nThis selection corresponds to a partition of the integer $k$ into $j$ distinct parts. The coefficient $c_k$ of $q^k$ in the expansion is therefore the sum of $(-1)^j$ over all possible partitions of $k$ into $j$ distinct parts.\n\nLet $p_d(k)$ be the number of partitions of $k$ into distinct parts. Let $E_d(k)$ be the number of partitions of $k$ into an even number of distinct parts, and $O_d(k)$ be the number of partitions of $k$ into an odd number of distinct parts.

Consider the bivariate generating function $P(q,z)$ that encodes partitions simultaneously by their total size and their number of parts via the formal power series in $q$ and $z$.

The Bivariate Generating Function for Partitions\n\nLet $p(n,m)$ denote the number of partitions of a non-negative integer $n$ into exactly $m$ positive integer parts. The bivariate generating function $P(q,z)$ that encodes these numbers is defined by the formal power series:\n$$\nP(q,z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} p(n,m) q^n z^m\n$$\nIn this series, the exponent of $q$ tracks the number being partitioned ($n$), and the exponent of $z$ tracks the number of parts in the partition ($m$).\n\nA partition can be constructed by choosing which positive integers to use as parts. The choices for each possible part are independent. For any positive integer $k$, we can use it as a part zero times, one time, two times, and so on. Using the part $k$ a total of $j$ times contributes $j \\cdot k$ to the total sum $n$, and $j$ to the total number of parts $m$. In the generating function, this corresponds to a term $(z q^k)^j$. Summing over all possible numbers of times $j$ we can use the part $k$, we get a geometric series:\n$$\n1 + zq^k + (zq^k)^2 + (zq^k)^3 + \\dots = \\frac{1}{1 - zq^k}\n$$\nSince the choices for each part $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$ are independent, the total generating function is the product of these individual series over all possible parts $k$:\n$$\nP(q,z) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 - zq^k}\n$$\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Recurrence Relation\n\nTo derive a recurrence relation for $p(n,m)$, we first establish a functional equation for $P(q,z)$. We can separate the first term ($k=1$) from the product expression for $P(q,z)$:\n$$\nP(q,z) = \\frac{1}{1 - zq} \\cdot \\prod_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 - zq^k}\n$$\nLet's examine the product on the right. We can re-index by letting $j = k-1$, which means $k = j+1$. As $k$ goes from $2$ to $\\infty$, $j$ goes from $1$ to $\\infty$:\n$$\n\\prod_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 - zq^k} = \\prod_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 - zq^{j+1}} = \\prod_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 - (zq)q^j}\n$$\nThe resulting expression is precisely the definition of $P(q,z)$ with the variable $z$ replaced by $zq$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\prod_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 - zq^k} = P(q, zq)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $P(q,z)$ yields the functional equation:\n$$\nP(q,z) = \\frac{1}{1 - zq} P(q,zq)\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n(1 - zq) P(q,z) = P(q, zq)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the power series definition of $P(q,z)$ into this equation:\n$$\n(1 - zq) \\sum_{n,m} p(n,m) q^n z^m = \\sum_{n,m} p(n,m) q^n (zq)^m\n$$\nExpanding the left side and simplifying the right side gives:\n$$\n\\sum_{n,m} p(n,m) q^n z^m - \\sum_{n,m} p(n,m) q^{n+1} z^{m+1} = \\sum_{n,m} p(n,m) q^{n+m} z^m\n$$\nTo find the recurrence for $p(n,m)$, we equate the coefficients of a general term $q^N z^M$ on both sides of this equation.\n- **Term 1 (LHS):** The coefficient of $q^N z^M$ in $\\sum_{n,m} p(n,m) q^n z^m$ is simply $p(N,M)$.\n- **Term 2 (LHS):** The coefficient of $q^N z^M$ in $\\sum_{n,m} p(n,m) q^{n+1} z^{m+1}$ corresponds to the case where $n+1=N$ and $m+1=M$, which means $n=N-1$ and $m=M-1$. The coefficient is thus $p(N-1, M-1)$.\n- **Term 3 (RHS):** We need the coefficient of $q^N z^M$ in $\\sum_{n,m} p(n,m) q^{n+m} z^m$. First, we fix $m=M$. The expression becomes $\\sum_{n} p(n,M) q^{n+M} z^M$. We need the coefficient of $q^N$ in $\\sum_{n} p(n,M) q^{n+M}$. This corresponds to the case where $n+M=N$, or $n=N-M$. The coefficient is thus $p(N-M, M)$.\n\nEquating the coefficients from the left and right sides, we get:\n$$\np(N,M) - p(N-1, M-1) = p(N-M, M)\n$$\nRe-arranging and using the generic variables $n$ and $m$, we obtain the desired recurrence relation:\n$$\np(n,m) = p(n-1, m-1) + p(n-m, m)\n$$\n\n### 3. Initial Conditions and Algorithmic Implementation\n\nTo use this recurrence, we must define initial (or boundary) conditions. These are determined from the definition of $p(n,m)$:\n- **$p(0,0) = 1$:** There is exactly one partition of $0$ into $0$ parts: the empty partition.\n- **$p(n,0) = 0$ for $n>0$:** It is impossible to partition a positive integer into zero parts.\n- **$p(0,m) = 0$ for $m>0$:** It is impossible to partition $0$ into a positive number of positive parts.\n- **$p(n,m) = 0$ if $n < m$:** The sum of $m$ positive integers must be at least $m$ (since each part is at least $1$). Therefore, if $n < m$, no such partition exists. This also implies $p(n,m)=0$ if $n<0$.\n\nThis recurrence can be efficiently implemented using dynamic programming. We can construct a $2$D array, let's call it $DP$, of size $(N_{\\max}+1) \\times (M_{\\max}+1)$, where $DP[i][j]$ will store the value of $p(i,j)$.\nThe table is initialized with zeros, and the base case $DP[0][0] = 1$ is set. We can then fill the table using the recurrence. The values $DP[i][j]$ depend on values with smaller $i$ or smaller $j$, so we can iterate $j$ (number of parts) from $1$ to $M_{\\max}$ in an outer loop, and $i$ (number to partition) from $1$ to $N_{\\max}$ in an inner loop.\n\nFor each pair $(i,j)$ where $i \\ge j > 0$:\n$$\nDP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j-1] + DP[i-j][j]\n$$\nIf $i < j$, then $DP[i][j] = 0$. The term $DP[i-j][j]$ is only added if $i \\ge j$, which is consistent with the boundary conditions.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is determined by the two nested loops, making it $O(N_{\\max} \\cdot M_{\\max})$. The space complexity is also $O(N_{\\max} \\cdot M_{\\max})$ to store the DP table. Given the constraints in the test suite, this is highly efficient.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the number of partitions of n into m parts, p(n,m), for a given\n    test suite using a dynamic programming approach based on a derived recurrence.\n\n    The recurrence relation for p(n,m) is p(n,m) = p(n-1, m-1) + p(n-m, m).\n    This is implemented using a 2D DP table.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        (0, 0),\n        (0, 1),\n        (1, 1),\n        (5, 2),\n        (5, 3),\n        (5, 4),\n        (5, 5),\n        (10, 3),\n        (7, 10),\n        (50, 1),\n        (20, 5),\n        (30, 10),\n    ]\n\n    # Determine the maximum n and m required for the DP table.\n    n_max = 0\n    m_max = 0\n    if test_cases:\n        n_max = max(case[0] for case in test_cases)\n        m_max = max(case[1] for case in test_cases)\n\n    # DP table to store p(i, j)\n    # dp[i][j] will store the number of partitions of i into j parts.\n    dp = np.zeros((n_max + 1, m_max + 1), dtype=np.int64)\n\n    # Base case: There is one partition of 0 into 0 parts (the empty partition).\n    if n_max >= 0 and m_max >= 0:\n        dp[0, 0] = 1\n\n    # Fill the DP table using the recurrence relation.\n    # The loops must be structured such that dependencies are computed first.\n    # dp[i][j] depends on dp[i-1][j-1] (previous j) and dp[i-j][j] (previous i).\n    # Iterating j in the outer loop and i in the inner loop satisfies this.\n    for j in range(1, m_max + 1):\n        for i in range(1, n_max + 1):\n            # Recurrence relation: p(n,m) = p(n-1, m-1) + p(n-m, m)\n            \n            # Term p(n-1, m-1)\n            term1 = dp[i-1, j-1]\n            \n            # Term p(n-m, m).
