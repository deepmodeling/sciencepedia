Let $k = n^2 - m^2$. The integral is $\\int_{0}^{1} \\exp(2\\pi i k \\alpha) d\\alpha$. This is a fundamental orthogonality relation for the characters of the circle group $\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nCase 1: $k=0$. This occurs when $n^2 - m^2 = 0$.

There are exactly $N$ such solutions. This confirms that $I(N) = N$.\n\nThis problem serves as a simple model for the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. In that method, integrals of products of exponential sums are used to count solutions to Diophantine equations. The integral $I(N) = \\int_0^1 |S(\\alpha)|^2 d\\alpha$ counts solutions to $n^2=m^2$.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine for which values of $n$ the congruence $x_1^3 + x_2^3 \\equiv n \\pmod{9}$ has solutions. To do this, we first need to determine the possible values of a single cube, $x^3$, modulo $9$. We can compute this for each residue class $x \\pmod{9}$.\n\nLet $x$ be an integer. We examine $x^3 \\pmod{9}$.\n*   If $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $x=3m$ for some integer $m$. Thus, $x^3 = (3m)^3 = 27m^3 = 3 \\cdot 9 \\cdot m^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$. This covers $x \\equiv 0, 3, 6 \\pmod{9}$.\n    *   $0^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$\n    *   $3^3 = 27 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$\n    *   $6^3 = 216 = 24 \\times 9 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$\n*   If $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $x=3m+1$ for some integer $m$. Thus, $x^3 = (3m+1)^3 = (3m)^3 + 3(3m)^2(1) + 3(3m)(1)^2 + 1^3 = 27m^3 + 27m^2 + 9m + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$. This covers $x \\equiv 1, 4, 7 \\pmod{9}$.\n    *   $1^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$\n    *   $4^3 = 64 = 7 \\times 9 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$\n    *   $7^3 = 343 = 38 \\times 9 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$\n*   If $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $x=3m+2$ for some integer $m$. Thus, $x^3 = (3m+2)^3 = (3m)^3 + 3(3m)^2(2) + 3(3m)(2)^2 + 2^3 = 27m^3 + 54m^2 + 36m + 8 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}$. This covers $x \\equiv 2, 5, 8 \\pmod{9}$.\n    *   $2^3 = 8 \\pmod{9}$\n    *   $5^3 = 125 = 13 \\times 9 + 8 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}$\n    *   $8^3 = 512 = 56 \\times 9 + 8 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}$\n\nSo, the set of all possible values for a cube modulo $9$ is $C = \\{0, 1, 8\\}$.\n\nNext, we find the possible values for the sum of two cubes, $x_1^3 + x_2^3$, modulo $9$. We need to compute all possible sums of two elements from the set $C$:\n*   $0+0 = 0$\n*   $0+1 = 1$\n*   $0+8 = 8$\n*   $1+1 = 2$\n*   $1+8 = 9 \\equiv 0$\n*   $8+8 = 16 \\equiv 7$\n\nThe set of all possible values for $x_1^3 + x_2^3 \\pmod{9}$ is $S = \\{0, 1, 2, 7, 8\\}$.\n\nThe congruence $x_1^3 + x_2^3 \\equiv n \\pmod{9}$ has no solutions if $n$ is not in the set $S$. The set of all residues modulo $9$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$. The residues not present in $S$ are $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\nTherefore, for $n \\equiv 3, 4, 5, 6 \\pmod{9}$, the congruence has no solutions.\n\nThis finding relates to the singular series $\\mathfrak{S}_{2,3}(n)$. The singular series is a product of local densities, $\\mathfrak{S}_{2,3}(n) = \\prod_p \\chi_p(n)$. The local density at a prime $p$ is $\\chi_p(n) = \\sum_{a=0}^\\infty M_p(n, a)$, where $M_p(n, a)$ is related to the number of solutions modulo powers of $p$. A more direct definition is $\\chi_p(n) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{N(p^t; n)}{p^{t(s-1)}}$, where $N(p^t; n)$ is the number of solutions to the congruence modulo $p^t$.\nIf for some $t_0$, $N(p^{t_0}; n) = 0$, then for any $t > t_0$, $N(p^t; n) = 0$. This is because any solution modulo $p^t$ must also be a solution modulo $p^{t_0}$. If there are no solutions modulo $p^{t_0}$, there can be none modulo $p^t$.\nIn our case, with $s=2, k=3$ and the modulus $9=3^2$, we are examining the local behavior at the prime $p=3$. We found that for $n \\equiv 3, 4, 5, 6 \\pmod{9}$, the number of solutions to $x_1^3+x_2^3\\equiv n\\ (\\mathrm{mod}\\ 3^2)$ is $N(3^2; n) = 0$.\nThis implies that for any $t \\ge 2$, $N(3^t; n)=0$ for these values of $n$.\nConsequently, the local density at $p=3$ is\n$$ \\chi_3(n) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{N(3^t; n)}{3^{t(2-1)}} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{0}{3^t} = 0 $$\nSince one of the factors in the product $\\mathfrak{S}_{2,3}(n) = \\chi_2(n) \\chi_3(n) \\chi_5(n) \\cdots$ is zero, the entire singular series vanishes: $\\mathfrak{S}_{2,3}(n) = 0$. This is a so-called \"local obstruction\" at the prime $3$.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. **For $n\\equiv 3,4,5,6\\ (\\mathrm{mod}\\ 9)$, there are no solutions to $x_1^3+x_2^3\\equiv n\\ (\\mathrm{mod}\\ 9)$; moreover, this impossibility persists modulo $3^t$ for all $t\\ge 2$, so the local density at $p=3$ is $0$ and thus $\\mathfrak{S}_{2,3}(n)=0$.**\nThis statement accurately reflects our derivation. We found that the congruence has no solutions precisely for $n \\equiv 3, 4, 5, 6 \\pmod{9}$.

We found that $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$ is an attainable value. For example, $x_1=3, x_2=6$ gives $3^3+6^3 = 27+216=243$, which is congruent to $0 \\pmod{9}$.

This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nE. **Such a congruence obstruction can only arise at a prime modulus, not at a composite modulus like $9$, so $\\mathfrak{S}_{2,3}(n)$ cannot vanish due to conditions modulo $9$.**\nThis statement fundamentally misunderstands the theory of local solubility in Waring's problem. Local obstructions are investigated at prime power moduli $p^t$. In many cases, particularly when $p$ divides $k$, one must investigate moduli $p^t$ with $t1$ to find obstructions. The modulus $9=3^2$ is precisely the kind of modulus that must be checked for $k=3$. Our analysis has explicitly shown that an obstruction exists modulo $9$.

The given sufficient condition is $Q^2\\Delta \\ll 1$, which translates to the inequality:\n$$2\\theta - \\kappa \\leq 0 \\implies \\kappa \\geq 2\\theta \\quad (**)$$\n\nOur goal is to maximize the common decay exponent $E$. The problem is thus to maximize $E$ subject to the relations $(*)$ and $(**)$.\nWe can express both $\\theta$ and $\\kappa$ in terms of $E$ using equation $(*)$:\nFrom $E = \\frac{4}{3}\\theta$, we get $\\theta = \\frac{3}{4}E$.\nFrom $E = \\kappa-3$, we get $\\kappa = E+3$.\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $\\theta$ and $\\kappa$ into the constraint inequality $(**)$:\n$$\\kappa \\geq 2\\theta$$\n$$E+3 \\geq 2\\left(\\frac{3}{4}E\\right)$$\n$$E+3 \\geq \\frac{3}{2}E$$\n\nTo solve for $E$, we rearrange the inequality:\n$$3 \\geq \\frac{3}{2}E - E$$\n$$3 \\geq \\left(\\frac{3}{2}-1\\right)E$$\n$$3 \\geq \\frac{1}{2}E$$\n$$6 \\geq E$$\n\nThis shows that the maximum possible value for the common decay exponent $E$ is $6$. To maximize $E$, we must choose $\\theta$ and $\\kappa$ such that this upper bound is achieved. The maximum $E=6$ is attained when the inequality becomes an equality, i.e., when $\\kappa = 2\\theta$. This corresponds to the tightest packing of major arcs that still guarantees disjointness under the given condition.\n\nSo, the optimal choice of parameters $(\\theta, \\kappa)$ must satisfy the following system of two linear equations:\n1. $\\frac{4}{3}\\theta = \\kappa-3$ (from balancing the errors)\n2. $\\kappa = 2\\theta$ (from maximizing the decay exponent)\n\nWe can solve this system by substituting the second equation into the first:\n$$\\frac{4}{3}\\theta = (2\\theta)-3$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $\\theta$:\n$$3 = 2\\theta - \\frac{4}{3}\\theta$$\n$$3 = \\left(\\frac{6}{3} - \\frac{4}{3}\\right)\\theta$$\n$$3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\theta$$\n$$\\theta = 3 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{9}{2}$$\n\nNow, we find the corresponding value of $\\kappa$ using the second equation, $\\kappa = 2\\theta$:\n$$\\kappa = 2 \\times \\frac{9}{2} = 9$$\n\nThe optimal pair of exponents is $(\\theta, \\kappa) = (\\frac{9}{2}, 9)$.\nWith this choice, the common decay exponent is $E = \\kappa-3 = 9-3=6$, and also $E = \\frac{4}{3}\\theta = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{36}{6} = 6$.
