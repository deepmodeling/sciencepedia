A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds by defining the necessary concepts from the geometry of numbers and applying them to the given problem.\n\nA lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that spans the vector space. For this problem, the lattice is $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, the set of all vectors with integer coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. This is the standard integer lattice. The basis vectors for $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ are the standard basis vectors of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$: $\\mathbf{e}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$, $\\mathbf{e}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$, and $\\mathbf{e}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$. These vectors can be viewed as the columns of the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix $I$.\n\nThe covolume of a lattice, denoted $\\text{vol}(\\Lambda)$, is the volume of its fundamental domain. A fundamental domain is a parallelepiped spanned by a set of basis vectors. For a lattice generated by the columns of a matrix $B$, the covolume is given by $\\text{vol}(\\Lambda) = |\\det(B)|$. For the standard lattice $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, the basis matrix is the identity matrix $I$, so its covolume is $\\text{vol}(\\mathbb{Z}^{3}) = |\\det(I)| = 1$.\n\nThe problem considers the set $A\\Lambda = A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, which is the image of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ under the linear transformation represented by the matrix $A$. Since $A$ is an invertible matrix with real entries, $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is also a lattice. A basis for this new lattice is given by the images of the basis vectors of $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$: $\\{A\\mathbf{e}_1, A\\mathbf{e}_2, A\\mathbf{e}_3\\}$. These are precisely the columns of the matrix $A$. Therefore, the lattice $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is generated by the columns of $A$.\n\nThe covolume of the lattice $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix whose columns form its basis, which is $A$ itself.\nWe compute the determinant of $A$:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}123\\\\014\\\\001\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $A$ is an upper triangular matrix, its determinant is the product of its diagonal entries:\n$$\n\\det(A) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n$$\nThe covolume of the transformed lattice is therefore $\\text{vol}(A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}) = |\\det(A)| = |1| = 1$.\n\nThe index of a sublattice $\\Lambda'$ within a lattice $\\Lambda$, denoted $[\\Lambda:\\Lambda']$, is the order of the quotient group $\\Lambda/\\Lambda'$. This index is finite if and only if $\\Lambda'$ has the same rank as $\\Lambda$. Since $A$ has integer entries, for any $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, the product $A\\mathbf{v}$ is also a vector with integer entries. This means $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$. As $\\det(A) \\neq 0$, the lattice $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ has rank $3$, the same as $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$. Therefore, $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is a sublattice of $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$.\n\nA fundamental result in the geometry of numbers states that if an integer matrix $A$ defines a sublattice $A\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ of $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, the index of this sublattice is given by the absolute value of the determinant of the transformation matrix.\n$$\n[\\mathbb{Z}^{n} : A\\mathbb{Z}^{n}] = |\\det(A)|\n$$\nThis can be understood as the ratio of the covolumes of the lattices: $[\\Lambda : \\Lambda'] = \\frac{\\text{vol}(\\Lambda')}{\\text{vol}(\\Lambda)}$, where $\\Lambda'$ is a sublattice of $\\Lambda$. Applied to our problem:\n$$\n[\\mathbb{Z}^{3} : A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}] = \\frac{\\text{vol}(A\\mathbb{Z}^{3})}{\\text{vol}(\\mathbb{Z}^{3})} = \\frac{|\\det(A)|}{|\\det(I)|} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n$$\nSo, the index $[\\Lambda:A\\Lambda]$ is $1$.\n\nNext, we infer whether $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3} = \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$. The index $[\\mathbb{Z}^{3} : A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}]$ represents the number of distinct cosets of $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$. An index of $1$ means there is only one coset, which must be $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ itself. This implies that the quotient group $\\mathbb{Z}^{3} / A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is the trivial group, which occurs if and only if the sublattice is identical to the original lattice. Therefore, $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3} = \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$.\n\nThis conclusion is further justified by the concept of unimodularity. An integer matrix $U \\in M_{n}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is called unimodular if its determinant is either $1$ or $-1$. The inverse of such a matrix, given by $U^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(U)}\\text{adj}(U)$, also has integer entries, since the adjugate matrix $\\text{adj}(U)$ consists of cofactors which are integer polynomials of the entries of $U$.\nA linear transformation represented by an integer matrix $A$ maps $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ to itself, i.e., $A\\mathbb{Z}^{n} = \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, if and only if $A$ is unimodular.\nIn this problem, the matrix $A$ has all integer entries, and we calculated its determinant to be $\\det(A) = 1$. Thus, $A$ is a unimodular matrix. According to the theorem, the transformation defined by $A$ is an automorphism of the group $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, meaning it is a bijection from $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ to itself. Consequently, the image of $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ under $A$ is $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ itself, confirming that $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3} = \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$.\n\nThe final answer required is the value of the index $[\\Lambda:A\\Lambda]$. Based on our calculation, this value is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3091243"}, {"introduction": "While any set of linearly independent vectors can form a basis for a lattice, some bases are more \"useful\" than others, particularly those consisting of short, nearly orthogonal vectors.

Any change of basis for a lattice can be represented by right-multiplication by a unimodular matrix $U$ (an integer matrix with $\\det(U) = \\pm 1$). That is, $B_{\\text{new}} = B_{\\text{old}} U$.\nUsing the property of determinants, $\\det(B_{\\text{new}}) = \\det(B_{\\text{old}} U) = \\det(B_{\\text{old}}) \\det(U)$.\nSince $\\det(U) = \\pm 1$, it follows that $\\det(B_{\\text{new}}) = \\pm \\det(B_{\\text{old}})$.\nThis implies that the absolute value of the determinant, $|\\det(B)|$, is an invariant for a given lattice. This invariant is called the covolume of the lattice, denoted $\\text{covol}(L)$, and it represents the volume (in this case, area) of the fundamental domain.\n\nIn our case, $\\det(B_{\\text{red}}) = -13$ and $\\det(B) = 13$. We have $\\det(B_{\\text{red}}) = (-1) \\times \\det(B)$, which is consistent with the theory. The overall unimodular transformation matrix that transformed the original basis to the reduced one had a determinant of $-1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the common absolute value of these determinants, which is the covolume of $L$.\n$$\n\\text{covol}(L) = |\\det(B)| = |13| = 13\n$$\n$$\n\\text{covol}(L) = |\\det(B_{\\text{red}})| = |-13| = 13\n$$\nThe value is $13$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{13}\n$$", "id": "3091236"}, {"introduction": "Moving from foundational theory to computational practice, this exercise addresses the estimation of a lattice's covering radius, which quantifies the size of the largest \"hole\" in the lattice.

The covering radius is formally defined as:\n$$\n\\mu(K,\\Lambda) = \\sup_{x \\in F(B)} \\inf_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\mu_K(x - Bm)\n$$\nwhere $B$ is the basis matrix of the lattice $\\Lambda$, $F(B)$ is the fundamental domain, and $\\mu_K$ is the Minkowski functional of $K$. We are tasked with creating a numerical approximation, $\\widehat{\\mu}(K,\\Lambda)$.\n\nThe method involves two primary approximations:\n1.  The supremum over the continuous fundamental domain $F(B)$ is replaced by a maximum over a finite grid of sample points.\n2.  The infimum over the infinite set of lattice points $\\Lambda = B\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is replaced by a minimum over a finite neighborhood of the origin in the lattice.\n\n**1. Discretization of the Fundamental Domain**\nThe fundamental domain is the set $F(B) = \\{ Bu : u \\in [0,1)^2 \\}$. We introduce a uniform grid in the parameter space $[0,1)^2$. Let $N$ be the resolution parameter, representing the number of points along each axis. The grid points for $u = (u_1, u_2)$ are given by:\n$$\nu_{ij} = \\left(\\frac{i}{N}, \\frac{j}{N}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } i, j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}\n$$\nThis generates a total of $N^2$ points in the parameter space. The corresponding sample points in the fundamental domain are $x_{ij} = B u_{ij}$. A larger value of $N$ provides a denser sampling of $F(B)$ and thus a more accurate estimate of the supremum, at the cost of increased computation. We select $N=200$ for a fine-grained search.\n\n**2. Finite Search Window for the Lattice**\nFor each sample point $x$, we need to find its distance to the lattice $\\Lambda$, defined as $d_K(x, \\Lambda) = \\inf_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\mu_K(x - Bm)$. An exhaustive search over the infinite set $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is impossible. However, since $x$ lies within the fundamental domain $F(B)$ (which is \"close\" to the origin), the lattice point $Bm$ that minimizes the distance $\\mu_K(x - Bm)$ is expected to correspond to an integer vector $m$ with small components. The problem specifies a symmetric search window for $m = (m_1, m_2)$:\n$$\nm \\in \\{-M, -M+1, \\dots, M\\}^2\n$$\nThis defines a finite set of $(2M+1)^2$ candidate lattice points to check for each sample point $x$. A larger $M$ increases the likelihood of finding the true closest lattice point, especially for highly skewed lattices, but also increases computational cost. We select $M=3$, resulting in a search over $(2 \\cdot 3 + 1)^2 = 49$ lattice points for each sample point, which is a robust choice for the given test cases.\n\n**3. The Algorithm**\nThe estimation algorithm for $\\widehat{\\mu}(K,\\Lambda)$ is as follows:\nInitialize an overall maximum distance `max_dist` to $0$.\nFor each grid point $u_{ij}$ where $i, j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$:\n  a. Compute the sample point $x = B u_{ij}$.\n  b. Initialize a minimum distance for this point, `min_dist_for_x`, to infinity.\n  c. For each integer vector $m=(m_1, m_2)$ where $m_1, m_2 \\in \\{-M, \\dots, M\\}$:\n     i. Compute the lattice point $\\lambda = Bm$.\n     ii. Calculate the distance $d = \\mu_K(x - \\lambda)$ using the specific gauge function for $K$.\n     iii. Update `min_dist_for_x = min(min_dist_for_x, d)`.\n  d. Update the overall maximum distance: `max_dist = max(max_dist, min_dist_for_x)`.\nThe final value of `max_dist` is our estimate $\\widehat{\\mu}(K,\\Lambda)$.\n\n**Implementation of Gauge Functions**\nThe gauges are implemented as follows:\n- **Euclidean unit ball**: $\\mu_K(v) = \\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}$. This is the standard Euclidean norm.\n- **$\\ell_\\infty$ unit ball**: $\\mu_K(v) = \\max(|v_1|, |v_2|)$. This is the maximum-coordinate norm.\n- **Ellipsoid**: For a given symmetric positive definite matrix $Q$, its inverse $Q^{-1}$ is computed. The gauge is then $\\mu_K(v) = \\sqrt{v^\\top Q^{-1} v}$. For Case 4, $Q = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\det(Q) = (3)(2) - (1)(1) = 5$. The inverse is $Q^{-1} = \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThis comprehensive, definition-driven approach ensures that the estimation is performed on a solid mathematical foundation, as required.
