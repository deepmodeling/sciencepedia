It does not violate any scientific principles, is not ambiguous, and presents a non-trivial challenge that can be solved with the specified elementary methods. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the quantity of interest be $E_t = 3^{2^t} - 1$. Our goal is to find $v_2(E_t)$.\nWe use the difference of squares factorization, $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$, repeatedly.\nFor $t \\ge 1$, we can write:\n$$E_t = 3^{2^t} - 1 = \\left(3^{2^{t-1}}\\right)^2 - 1^2 = \\left(3^{2^{t-1}} - 1\\right)\\left(3^{2^{t-1}} + 1\\right)$$\nWe can apply this factorization recursively to the first term, $3^{2^{t-1}} - 1$:\n$$3^{2^{t-1}} - 1 = \\left(3^{2^{t-2}} - 1\\right)\\left(3^{2^{t-2}} + 1\\right)$$\nRepeating this process until the exponent of $3$ is $2^0=1$, we obtain a full factorization of $E_t$:\n\\begin{align*} E_t &= \\left(3^{2^0} - 1\\right) \\left(3^{2^0} + 1\\right) \\left(3^{2^1} + 1\\right) \\left(3^{2^2} + 1\\right) \\cdots \\left(3^{2^{t-1}} + 1\\right) \\\\ &= (3-1) \\prod_{i=0}^{t-1} \\left(3^{2^i} + 1\\right) \\\\ &= 2 \\prod_{i=0}^{t-1} \\left(3^{2^i} + 1\\right) \\end{align*}\nThe $2$-adic valuation $v_2$ has the property that $v_2(xy) = v_2(x) + v_2(y)$. Applying this to the product form of $E_t$:\n$$v_2(E_t) = v_2(2) + \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} v_2\\left(3^{2^i} + 1\\right)$$\nWe now evaluate $v_2$ for each term in this sum.\nFirst, $v_2(2) = 1$.\nNext, we analyze the terms $v_2(3^{2^i} + 1)$ for $i \\ge 0$.\n\nCase 1: $i=0$.\nThe term is $3^{2^0} + 1 = 3^1 + 1 = 4$.\nSo, $v_2(3^{2^0} + 1) = v_2(4) = v_2(2^2) = 2$.\n\nCase 2: $i \\ge 1$.\nFor any integer $i \\ge 1$, the exponent $2^i$ is an even number. Let's analyze the term $3^{2^i} + 1$ using congruences.\nConsider the base $3$ modulo $8$. We have $3^2 = 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$.\nFor any $i \\ge 1$, we can write $2^i = 2 \\cdot 2^{i-1}$. Thus,\n$$3^{2^i} = 3^{2 \\cdot 2^{i-1}} = (3^2)^{2^{i-1}} \\equiv 1^{2^{i-1}} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$$\nThis shows that for $i \\ge 1$, $3^{2^i}$ leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by $8$.\nTherefore, for $i \\ge 1$:\n$$3^{2^i} + 1 \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$$\nA number that is congruent to $2$ modulo $8$ must be of the form $8m+2$ for some integer $m$.\nThis can be written as $2(4m+1)$. Since $4m+1$ is always an odd number, the highest power of $2$ that divides $8m+2$ is $2^1$.\nHence, for all integers $i \\ge 1$, we have $v_2(3^{2^i} + 1) = 1$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values back into the expression for $v_2(E_t)$.\nSince $t$ is a positive integer, $t \\ge 1$.\n$$v_2(E_t) = v_2(2) + v_2(3^{2^0}+1) + \\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} v_2(3^{2^i} + 1)$$\nNote that if $t=1$, the summation $\\sum_{i=1}^{0}$ is an empty sum, which is $0$.\nFor $t=1$:\n$$v_2(E_1) = v_2(3^2-1) = v_2(2) + v_2(3+1) = 1 + 2 = 3$$\nFor $t > 1$:\n$$v_2(E_t) = 1 + 2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} 1$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} 1$ contains $t-1$ terms, so its value is $t-1$.\n$$v_2(E_t) = 1 + 2 + (t-1) = 3 + t - 1 = t+2$$\nThis formula $t+2$ also holds for the case $t=1$, since $1+2=3$.\nThus, for any positive integer $t$, we have established that $v_2(3^{2^t} - 1) = t+2$.\n\nNow, we address the second part of the problem. We need to explain how this result implies that for any integer $k \\ge 3$, the least integer $e \\ge 0$ such that $3^{2^e} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^k}$ is $e=k-2$.\nThe congruence $3^{2^e} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^k}$ is equivalent to the statement that $3^{2^e} - 1$ is divisible by $2^k$. In terms of the $2$-adic valuation, this is equivalent to the inequality:\n$$v_2(3^{2^e} - 1) \\ge k$$\nWe are looking for the smallest non-negative integer $e$ that satisfies this condition. Let's test values of $e$.\n\nIf $e=0$:\nWe have $v_2(3^{2^0} - 1) = v_2(3-1) = v_2(2) = 1$.\nThe condition becomes $1 \\ge k$. However, we are given that $k \\ge 3$. So $e=0$ is not a solution.\n\nIf $e \\ge 1$:\nFor positive integers $e$, we can apply our derived formula (by setting $t=e$):\n$$v_2(3^{2^e} - 1) = e+2$$\nThe condition becomes $e+2 \\ge k$, which simplifies to $e \\ge k-2$.\nSince we are looking for the least integer $e$ that satisfies this, we choose the smallest possible value, which is $e=k-2$.\nWe must ensure this choice of $e$ is consistent with our assumption that $e \\ge 1$.\nGiven $k \\ge 3$, we have $k-2 \\ge 3-2 = 1$. Thus, the value $e=k-2$ is indeed a positive integer.\nSo, the least integer $e \\ge 1$ satisfying the condition is $e=k-2$. Since $e=0$ is not a solution, $e=k-2$ is the overall least non-negative integer.\n\nThis illustrates the \"lifting\" of exponents. Let $e_k$ be the minimal $e$ for a given $k \\ge 3$. We found $e_k=k-2$. When we increase the modulus from $2^k$ to $2^{k+1}$, the new minimal exponent is $e_{k+1}=(k+1)-2=k-1$. Thus, $e_{k+1} = e_k+1$. To satisfy the congruence for the next higher power of $2$, we must double the exponent of $3$ one more time (i.e., increment $e$ by $1$), which is a characteristic behavior in such congruence problems modulo prime powers.\n\nThe final answer required is the closed-form expression for $v_2(3^{2^t}-1)$.\nBased on our derivation, this is $t+2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{t+2}$$", "id": "3086855"}, {"introduction": "The iterative lifting process we've explored relies on a crucial condition: the derivative at the root must not be zero modulo $p$.

The congruence is:\n$$(x - 14)^{3} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$$\nSince $14$ is a multiple of $7$, we have $14 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. The congruence simplifies to:\n$$x^{3} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$$\nBecause $7$ is a prime number, if $7$ divides $x^{3}$, then $7$ must divide $x$. Therefore, the only solution to the congruence modulo $7$ is:\n$$x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$$\nWe denote this base solution as $x_0 = 0$.\n\nNext, we determine if this root is repeated. A root $x_0$ of a polynomial congruence $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ is repeated if $f'(x_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, where $f'(x)$ is the formal derivative of $f(x)$.
