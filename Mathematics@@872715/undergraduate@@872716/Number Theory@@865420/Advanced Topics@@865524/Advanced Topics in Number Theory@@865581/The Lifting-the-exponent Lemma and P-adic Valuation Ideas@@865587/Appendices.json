A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to determine the exact value of $v_{7}(8^{n}-1)$ for any positive integer $n$. The value $v_{7}(N)$ represents the exponent of the highest power of $7$ that divides the integer $N$. We are asked to express this in terms of $v_{7}(n)$.\n\nLet $k = v_{7}(n)$ be the $7$-adic valuation of $n$. By the definition of valuation, we can write $n$ in the form $n = m \\cdot 7^{k}$ for some positive integer $m$ such that $7 \\nmid m$, which implies $v_{7}(m)=0$.\n\nWe can now write the expression $8^{n}-1$ as:\n$$8^{n}-1 = 8^{m \\cdot 7^{k}} - 1 = (8^{7^{k}})^{m} - 1$$\nWe use the well-known algebraic identity for a difference of powers, $x^{m}-y^{m} = (x-y)(x^{m-1} + x^{m-2}y + \\dots + y^{m-1})$. Setting $x = 8^{7^{k}}$ and $y = 1$, we have:\n$$8^{n}-1 = (8^{7^{k}}-1) \\left( (8^{7^{k}})^{m-1} + (8^{7^{k}})^{m-2} + \\dots + 8^{7^{k}} + 1 \\right)$$\nLet $S = (8^{7^{k}})^{m-1} + (8^{7^{k}})^{m-2} + \\dots + 1$. Using the property $v_{p}(ab) = v_{p}(a) + v_{p}(b)$, we can write:\n$$v_{7}(8^{n}-1) = v_{7}(8^{7^{k}}-1) + v_{7}(S)$$\nWe now analyze the valuation of the sum $S$. We consider $S$ modulo $7$. We know that $8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, any power of $8$ is also congruent to $1$ modulo $7$. Specifically, $8^{7^{k}} \\equiv 1^{7^{k}} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $S$:\n$$S \\equiv \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} (1)^{j} \\pmod{7} \\equiv \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} 1 \\pmod{7} \\equiv m \\pmod{7}$$\nBy our initial definition of $m$, we have $7 \\nmid m$, so $m \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. This implies that $S \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$, which means $7$ does not divide $S$. By the definition of $p$-adic valuation, this means $v_{7}(S) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the valuation of the first term:\n$$v_{7}(8^{n}-1) = v_{7}(8^{7^{k}}-1)$$\nWe shall now prove by induction on the non-negative integer $k$ that $v_{7}(8^{7^{k}}-1) = k+1$.\n\n**Base Case:** For $k=0$, we need to calculate $v_{7}(8^{7^{0}}-1)$.\n$$v_{7}(8^{1}-1) = v_{7}(7) = 1$$\nThe formula $k+1$ gives $0+1=1$, so the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for some non-negative integer $k$, the statement $v_{7}(8^{7^{k}}-1) = k+1$ is true. This implies that we can write $8^{7^{k}}-1 = c \\cdot 7^{k+1}$ for some integer $c$ such that $v_{7}(c)=0$ (i.e., $7 \\nmid c$). Rearranging, we have $8^{7^{k}} = 1 + c \\cdot 7^{k+1}$.\n\n**Inductive Step:** We want to prove the statement for $k+1$, i.e., we want to compute $v_{7}(8^{7^{k+1}}-1)$.\n$$8^{7^{k+1}}-1 = (8^{7^{k}})^{7}-1$$\nSubstitute the expression for $8^{7^{k}}$ from the inductive hypothesis:\n$$(8^{7^{k}})^{7}-1 = (1 + c \\cdot 7^{k+1})^{7}-1$$\nWe expand the term $(1 + c \\cdot 7^{k+1})^{7}$ using the binomial theorem, $(a+b)^{j} = \\sum_{i=0}^{j} \\binom{j}{i}a^{j-i}b^{i}$:\n$$(1 + c \\cdot 7^{k+1})^{7}-1 = \\left[ \\binom{7}{0}1^{7} + \\binom{7}{1}1^{6}(c \\cdot 7^{k+1})^{1} + \\binom{7}{2}1^{5}(c \\cdot 7^{k+1})^{2} + \\dots + \\binom{7}{7}(c \\cdot 7^{k+1})^{7} \\right] - 1$$\n$$(1 + c \\cdot 7^{k+1})^{7}-1 = \\left[ 1 + 7(c \\cdot 7^{k+1}) + \\binom{7}{2}(c \\cdot 7^{k+1})^{2} + \\sum_{i=3}^{7} \\binom{7}{i}(c \\cdot 7^{k+1})^{i} \\right] - 1$$\n$$= c \\cdot 7^{k+2} + \\binom{7}{2} c^{2} \\cdot 7^{2(k+1)} + \\sum_{i=3}^{7} \\binom{7}{i} (c \\cdot 7^{k+1})^{i}$$\nLet's analyze the $7$-adic valuation of each term in this sum.\nLet $T_{i} = \\binom{7}{i}(c \\cdot 7^{k+1})^{i}$. The valuation is $v_{7}(T_{i}) = v_{7}\\left(\\binom{7}{i}\\right) + i \\cdot (k+1) + i \\cdot v_{7}(c)$. Since $v_{7}(c)=0$, this simplifies to $v_{7}(T_{i}) = v_{7}\\left(\\binom{7}{i}\\right) + i(k+1)$.\n\nFor $i=1$: $T_{1} = \\binom{7}{1}c \\cdot 7^{k+1} = 7c \\cdot 7^{k+1} = c \\cdot 7^{k+2}$.\n$v_{7}(T_{1}) = v_{7}(c) + k+2 = k+2$.\n\nFor $i=2$: $T_{2} = \\binom{7}{2}c^{2} \\cdot 7^{2(k+1)} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 6}{2}c^{2} \\cdot 7^{2k+2} = 21c^{2} \\cdot 7^{2k+2} = 3c^{2} \\cdot 7^{2k+3}$.\nFor the binomial coefficient $\\binom{p}{i}$ where $p$ is prime and $1 \\le i  p$, $v_{p}(\\binom{p}{i})=1$. So $v_{7}(\\binom{7}{2})=1$.\n$v_{7}(T_{2}) = v_{7}(21) + 2(k+1) = 1 + 2k+2 = 2k+3$.\nFor $k \\ge 0$, we have $2k+3 = (k+2) + (k+1) > k+2$. So $v_{7}(T_{2}) > v_{7}(T_{1})$.\n\nFor any $i$ such that $2 \\le i  7$: $v_{7}\\left(\\binom{7}{i}\\right) = 1$.\n$v_{7}(T_{i}) = 1 + i(k+1)$. We check if this is greater than $k+2$:\n$1 + i(k+1) > k+2 \\iff i(k+1) > k+1$. Since $i \\ge 2$ and $k \\ge 0$, $k+1 \\ge 1$, this inequality holds.\n\nFor $i=7$: $v_{7}(T_{7}) = v_{7}(\\binom{7}{7}) + 7(k+1) = v_{7}(1) + 7k+7 = 7k+7$.\n$7k+7 = (k+2) + (6k+5) > k+2$ for $k \\ge 0$.\n\nWe have the sum $8^{7^{k+1}}-1 = T_{1} + T_{2} + \\dots + T_{7}$. The strong triangle inequality for valuations states $v_{p}(a+b) \\ge \\min\\{v_{p}(a), v_{p}(b)\\}$, and equality holds if $v_{p}(a) \\neq v_{p}(b)$.\nHere, we have $v_{7}(T_{1}) = k+2$ and $v_{7}(T_{i}) > k+2$ for all $i \\in \\{2, 3, \\dots, 7\\}$.\nThus, the valuation of the sum is determined by the unique term with the minimum valuation:\n$$v_{7}(8^{7^{k+1}}-1) = v_{7}(T_{1} + T_{2} + \\dots + T_{7}) = \\min_{1 \\le i \\le 7} \\{v_{7}(T_{i})\\} = v_{7}(T_{1}) = k+2$$\nThis completes the inductive step.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, we have proven that $v_{7}(8^{7^{k}}-1) = k+1$ for all non-negative integers $k$.\nRecalling our initial setup, $k = v_{7}(n)$, and $v_{7}(8^{n}-1) = v_{7}(8^{7^{k}}-1)$, we can conclude:\n$$v_{7}(8^{n}-1) = k+1 = v_{7}(n) + 1$$\nThis result is a specific instance of the Lifting-The-Exponent Lemma. The derivation explains how the lemma works: each factor of the prime $p=7$ in the exponent $n$ contributes an additional factor of $p$ to the expression $x^{n}-y^{n}$ on top of the base valuation $v_{p}(x-y)$. Here, the base valuation is $v_{7}(8-1)=v_{7}(7)=1$.
