No scientific or factual unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity is present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution is warranted.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental separation property of distinct reduced fractions.\nLet $x_i = a_i/q_i$ and $x_j = a_j/q_j$ be two distinct points in the set $\\mathcal{F}(Q)$. By definition, $1 \\le q_i \\le Q$ and $1 \\le q_j \\le Q$. The absolute difference between these two fractions is\n$$ |x_i - x_j| = \\left| \\frac{a_i}{q_i} - \\frac{a_j}{q_j} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{a_i q_j - a_j q_i}{q_i q_j} \\right|. $$\nSince $a_i, q_i, a_j, q_j$ are all integers and the fractions are distinct, the numerator $a_i q_j - a_j q_i$ must be a non-zero integer. Consequently, its absolute value must be at least $1$: $|a_i q_j - a_j q_i| \\ge 1$.\nThe product of the denominators is bounded by $q_i q_j \\le Q \\cdot Q = Q^2$.\nCombining these inequalities, we establish a minimum separation distance between any two distinct points in $\\mathcal{F}(Q)$:\n$$ |x_i - x_j| \\ge \\frac{1}{q_i q_j} \\ge \\frac{1}{Q^2}. $$\nNow, let $I$ be an arbitrary interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ with length $|I|=\\delta$. Let the points from $\\mathcal{F}(Q)$ that fall within this interval be denoted by $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k\\}$, where $k = |\\mathcal{F}(Q) \\cap I|$ and the points are sorted in increasing order, $x_1  x_2  \\dots  x_k$.\nSince all these points are contained in $I$, the distance between the smallest and the largest point cannot exceed the length of the interval, which is $\\delta$.\n$$ x_k - x_1 \\le \\delta. $$\nThe distance $x_k - x_1$ can be expressed as a sum of the lengths of the sub-intervals between consecutive points:\n$$ x_k - x_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} (x_{i+1} - x_i). $$\nApplying our minimum separation distance to each term $(x_{i+1} - x_i)$, we have:\n$$ x_k - x_1 \\ge \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \\frac{1}{Q^2} = (k-1) \\frac{1}{Q^2}. $$\nWe now have a chain of inequalities:\n$$ (k-1) \\frac{1}{Q^2} \\le x_k - x_1 \\le \\delta. $$\nFrom this, we deduce $(k-1)/Q^2 \\le \\delta$, which can be rearranged to form an upper bound on $k$:\n$$ k - 1 \\le \\delta Q^2 \\implies k \\le 1 + \\delta Q^2. $$\nThis inequality must hold for the number of points $k$ in any interval $I$. Therefore, it also holds for the maximum number of points, $M(Q,\\delta)$:\n$$ M(Q, \\delta) \\le 1 + \\delta Q^2. $$\nThis is the required explicit upper bound, depending only on $Q$ and $\\delta$.\n\nTo explain the growth order, we recall the definition of big-O notation. A function $f(x)$ is said to be $O(g(x))$ if there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that $|f(x)| \\le C|g(x)|$ for sufficiently large $x$.\nIn our case, the variables are $Q$ and $\\delta$. The derived bound is $M(Q,\\delta) \\le 1 \\cdot (1 + \\delta Q^2)$. Since $M(Q,\\delta) \\ge 0$ and $1+\\delta Q^2  0$ for $Q \\ge 1, \\delta0$, this inequality directly satisfies the definition of big-O notation with the constant $C=1$. Thus, we can write $M(Q,\\delta) = O(1 + \\delta Q^2)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the upper bound for $Q = 800$ and $\\delta = 3 \\times 10^{-3}$.\nThe bound is given by the expression $1 + \\delta Q^2$.\n$$ 1 + (3 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (800)^2 = 1 + (3 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (640000) $$\n$$ = 1 + (3 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (64 \\times 10^4) $$\n$$ = 1 + (3 \\times 64) \\cdot (10^{-3} \\times 10^4) $$\n$$ = 1 + 192 \\cdot 10^1 $$\n$$ = 1 + 1920 = 1921. $$\nThe problem requests the final numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

It presents a standard context in analytic number theory—the large sieve inequality—and asks for a conceptual assessment of a plausible but incorrect heuristic. The definitions and stated facts are scientifically sound and the question is well-posed.\n\nThe core principle underpinning the large sieve inequality is its dependence on the geometric spacing of the sampling points, not merely their count. The analytic form of the large sieve inequality states that for any set of $R$ points $\\{\\alpha_j\\}_{j=1}^R \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ that are $\\delta$-separated modulo $1$ (i.e., for any $j \\ne k$, the distance from $\\alpha_j - \\alpha_k$ to the nearest integer is at least $\\delta$), the following inequality holds:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^R \\left| \\sum_{n=1}^N a_n e(n \\alpha_j) \\right|^2 \\le \\left( N - 1 + \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\right) \\sum_{n=1}^N |a_n|^2 $$\nwhere $e(x) \\coloneqq e^{2\\pi i x}$. For large $N$, this is often written as $(N + \\delta^{-1}) \\sum |a_n|^2$. The term $\\delta^{-1}$ is the crucial \"quadratic term\" when $\\delta$ depends on some parameter like $Q^{-2}$. This shows that the strength of the bound is governed by the minimum spacing $\\delta$ between points. A smaller $\\delta$ (denser points) leads to a weaker bound (larger $\\delta^{-1}$).\n\nThe standard arithmetic form of the large sieve inequality is a sum over the Farey set $\\mathcal{F}_Q = \\{\\tfrac{a}{q} : 1 \\le a \\le q \\le Q,\\ \\gcd(a,q)=1\\}$:\n$$ \\sum_{q \\le Q} \\sum_{\\substack{a=1 \\\\ \\gcd(a,q)=1}}^q \\left| S\\left(\\frac{a}{q}\\right) \\right|^2 \\le (N - 1 + Q^2) \\sum_{n=1}^N |a_n|^2 $$\nThis bound arises from the fact that the points in $\\mathcal{F}_Q$ are well-spaced. For any two distinct fractions $\\frac{a}{q}, \\frac{b}{r} \\in \\mathcal{F}_Q$, their difference is\n$$ \\left| \\frac{a}{q} - \\frac{b}{r} \\right| = \\frac{|ar - bq|}{qr} $$\nSince $ar - bq$ is a non-zero integer, $|ar - bq| \\ge 1$. As $q, r \\le Q$, we have $qr \\le Q^2$, so the spacing is at least $1/Q^2$. To see that this spacing is sharp in order of magnitude, consider the fractions $\\frac{Q-1}{Q}$ and $\\frac{Q-2}{Q-1}$ (assuming $Q, Q-1$ are coprime, which they are). Both are in $\\mathcal{F}_Q$. Their difference is $\\left| \\frac{Q-1}{Q} - \\frac{Q-2}{Q-1} \\right| = \\frac{|(Q-1)^2 - Q(Q-2)|}{Q(Q-1)} = \\frac{1}{Q^2-Q}$. The minimal spacing $\\delta$ for $\\mathcal{F}_Q$ is thus $\\asymp Q^{-2}$, which gives rise to the $Q^2$ term in the bound.\n\nThe problem asks what happens when we restrict the sum to the prime-level subset $\\mathcal{P}_Q = \\{\\tfrac{a}{p} : p \\text{ prime},\\ p \\le Q,\\ 1 \\le a \\le p-1\\}$. The cardinality of this set is $|\\mathcal{P}_Q| = \\sum_{p \\le Q} (p-1) \\sim \\frac{Q^2}{2\\log Q}$, which is smaller than $|\\mathcal{F}_Q| = \\sum_{q \\le Q} \\varphi(q) \\asymp \\frac{3}{\\pi^2} Q^2$ by a factor of roughly $\\log Q$. The heuristic suggests this reduction in the number of points should improve the bound by a similar factor.\n\nTo test this, we must examine the minimal spacing of the points in $\\mathcal{P}_Q$. Let $\\frac{a}{p}$ and $\\frac{b}{p'}$ be two distinct points in $\\mathcal{P}_Q$, with $p, p'$ being prime numbers $\\le Q$. Their distance is $\\left| \\frac{a}{p} - \\frac{b}{p'} \\right| = \\frac{|ap' - bp|}{pp'}$. Since the fractions are distinct, $ap' - bp \\ne 0$, so $|ap' - bp| \\ge 1$. The distance is at least $\\frac{1}{pp'}$. To find the minimal spacing $\\delta$ for the set $\\mathcal{P}_Q$, we must find the pair of points that are closest together. This corresponds to maximizing the denominator $pp'$. This maximum is achieved by choosing $p$ and $p'$ to be the largest two distinct primes less than or equal to $Q$. By the Prime Number Theorem, for large $Q$, there are primes very close to $Q$. Let $p_1$ and $p_2$ be the largest two primes $\\le Q$. Then $p_1 \\sim Q$ and $p_2 \\sim Q$. The product $p_1 p_2 \\sim Q^2$. We can always find integers $a, b$ such that $|ap_2 - bp_1|=1$. We can then choose representatives modulo $p_1$ and $p_2$ to fall in the desired ranges. This means there exist points in $\\mathcal{P}_Q$ with spacing $\\frac{1}{p_1 p_2} \\asymp Q^{-2}$.\n\nTherefore, the minimal spacing $\\delta$ for the set $\\mathcal{P}_Q$ is of the same order of magnitude, $Q^{-2}$, as for the full Farey set $\\mathcal{F}_Q$. Consequently, the term $\\delta^{-1}$ in the large sieve inequality remains of the order $Q^2$. The heuristic is incorrect because it conflates the cardinality of the sampling set with its geometric spacing. The worst-case spacing, not the number of points, determines the bound.\n\nWith this understanding, we evaluate the options:\n\nA. Replacing the sum over all moduli $q \\le Q$ by the sum over prime moduli $p \\le Q$ necessarily improves the quadratic term in an optimal bound to be of the form $C \\bigl(N + Q^2/\\log Q\\bigr)\\sum_{n=1}^N |a_n|^2$ with an absolute constant $C$, uniformly in $N$ and $Q$.\nThis statement claims the flawed heuristic is correct. Our analysis shows that the minimal spacing is still $\\asymp Q^{-2}$, so the quadratic term in the bound remains $\\asymp Q^2$, not $Q^2/\\log Q$. The statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nB. Even when summing only over prime moduli $p \\le Q$, an optimal uniform bound is still of the shape $C \\bigl(N + Q^2\\bigr)\\sum_{n=1}^N |a_n|^2$ with an absolute constant $C$, i.e., no factor of $1/\\log Q$ can be inserted in front of $Q^2$ in general.\nThis aligns with our analysis. Since the minimal spacing $\\delta$ for $\\mathcal{P}_Q$ is $\\asymp Q^{-2}$, the factor $\\delta^{-1}$ in the large sieve inequality is $\\asymp Q^2$. Thus, the bound must contain a term of order $Q^2$. In fact, the standard large sieve inequality $\\sum_{q\\le Q}\\dots \\le (N-1+Q^2)\\sum|a_n|^2$ directly implies $\\sum_{p\\le Q}\\dots \\le (N-1+Q^2)\\sum|a_n|^2$, which is of the stated form. The statement is **Correct**.\n\nC. The quadratic term in the best uniform bound is governed by the minimal spacing between distinct sampling points modulo $1$, which for reduced fractions with $p \\le Q$ is $\\asymp Q^{-2}$, so restricting to primes does not change the $Q^2$ scale of that term.\nThis statement provides the correct, first-principles-based reasoning. The large sieve bound depends on the minimal spacing $\\delta$. For the set $\\mathcal{P}_Q$, the minimal spacing is indeed $\\asymp Q^{-2}$, as shown by considering fractions with denominators equal to the largest two primes below $Q$. This is the same order as for the full Farey set $\\mathcal{F}_Q$. Thus, the $Q^2$ term is unaffected. The statement is **Correct**.\n\nD. If, for each prime $p \\le Q$, one retains only a single residue class $a \\pmod{p}$, then the quadratic term must improve by a factor of about $\\log Q$, simply because the number of sampled points has dropped from $\\asymp Q^2/\\log Q$ down to $\\asymp Q/\\log Q$.\nThis proposes a situation with even fewer points and again applies the same flawed cardinality-based reasoning. The new set of points consists of one fraction $a_p/p$ for each prime $p \\le Q$. The minimal spacing between two such points, $a_p/p$ and $a_{p'}/p'$, is still governed by the pairs of largest primes, so $\\delta \\asymp Q^{-2}$. The $Q^2$ term in the bound would not improve. The reasoning provided is precisely the incorrect heuristic. The statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nE. The heuristic that fewer points $\\alpha$ (here by a factor $\\asymp 1/\\log Q$) should force a $1/\\log Q$ improvement in the quadratic term conflates cardinality with spacing; in large-sieve-type bounds the controlling parameter is the spacing, so this heuristic is not valid for $\\mathcal{P}_Q$.\nThis statement accurately diagnoses the conceptual error in the heuristic. It correctly identifies that the bound is controlled by spacing ($\\delta$), not cardinality ($R$), and that mistaking one for the other leads to the invalid conclusion.

As $N \\to \\infty$, $Q^2 \\sim N$, so the numerator is asymptotic to $N+N=2N$.\n\nNext, we analyze the denominator, $N \\sum_{q \\leq Q} \\varphi(q)$.\nWe use the provided asymptotic relationship for the sum of the totient function:\n$$ \\sum_{q \\leq x} \\varphi(q) \\sim \\frac{3}{\\pi^2} x^2 \\quad \\text{as } x \\to \\infty. $$\nSince $Q = \\lfloor N^{1/2} \\rfloor \\to \\infty$ as $N \\to \\infty$, we can apply this formula with $x=Q$:\n$$ \\sum_{q \\leq Q} \\varphi(q) \\sim \\frac{3}{\\pi^2} Q^2. $$\nThe denominator is therefore asymptotic to:\n$$ N \\sum_{q \\leq Q} \\varphi(q) \\sim N \\left(\\frac{3}{\\pi^2} Q^2\\right) \\sim N \\left(\\frac{3}{\\pi^2} N\\right) = \\frac{3}{\\pi^2} N^2. $$\nNow we can evaluate the limit of the ratio $R(N)$:\n$$ L = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} R(N) = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{N+Q^2}{N \\sum_{q \\leq Q} \\varphi(q)}. $$\nSubstituting the asymptotic behavior of the numerator and denominator:\n$$ L = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{2N}{\\frac{3}{\\pi^2} N^2} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{2\\pi^2}{3N} = 0. $$\nThe limit is zero. This result highlights the power of the large sieve inequality, which provides a substantially stronger bound than the trivial estimate for the chosen range of $Q \\approx N^{1/2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3091742"}]}
