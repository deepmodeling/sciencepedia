A Dirichlet character modulo $8$ is a completely multiplicative function $\\chi:\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{C}$ such that $\\chi(n)=0$ if $\\gcd(n,8)\\neq 1$ and $\\chi(n)$ depends only on the residue class of $n$ modulo $8$ for $\\gcd(n,8)=1$. Each such $\\chi$ restricts to a group homomorphism $\\chi:(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}\\to\\mathbb{C}^{\\times}$, and the principal character $\\chi_{0}$ is defined by $\\chi_{0}(n)=1$ for $\\gcd(n,8)=1$ and $\\chi_{0}(n)=0$ otherwise.

Express your final answer as this single row matrix. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We proceed with the solution by addressing the four specified tasks.\n\nThe group of units modulo $8$ is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} = \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. This is an abelian group of order $4$. We analyze its structure by examining the orders of its elements under multiplication modulo $8$:\n$3^2 = 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$\n$5^2 = 25 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$\n$7^2 = 49 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$\nEvery non-identity element has order $2$. This means the group $G$ is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$. We can choose the elements $3$ and $5$ as a set of generators, since $3 \\times 5 = 15 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $8$ restricts to a group homomorphism from $G$ to the multiplicative group of complex numbers, $\\mathbb{C}^{\\times}$. Since for any $g \\in G$, $g^2=1$, we must have $\\chi(g^2) = \\chi(g)^2 = \\chi(1) = 1$. This implies that the image of any element $g \\in G$ under $\\chi$ must be a square root of unity, i.e., $\\chi(g) \\in \\{1, -1\\}$. A character is completely determined by its values on the generators $3$ and $5$. There are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible combinations for $(\\chi(3), \\chi(5))$, which correspond to the four distinct characters modulo $8$.\n\n1.  **Construction of Dirichlet characters modulo 8**\n    We construct the four characters by specifying their values on the generators $3$ and $5$. We use the notation $\\chi_{a,b}$ where $a = \\chi(3)$ and $b = \\chi(5)$. The value for $\\chi(1)$ is always $1$, and $\\chi(7) = \\chi(3 \\cdot 5) = \\chi(3)\\chi(5)$.\n\n    -   **Character 1: Let $\\chi(3)=1$ and $\\chi(5)=1$.**\n        This is the character $\\chi_{1,1}$. The values on $G$ are:\n        $\\chi_{1,1}(1) = 1$\n        $\\chi_{1,1}(3) = 1$\n        $\\chi_{1,1}(5) = 1$\n        $\\chi_{1,1}(7) = \\chi_{1,1}(3)\\chi_{1,1}(5) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n        For any integer $n$, $\\chi_{1,1}(n)=1$ if $\\gcd(n,8)=1$, and $\\chi_{1,1}(n)=0$ otherwise.\n\n    -   **Character 2: Let $\\chi(3)=-1$ and $\\chi(5)=1$.**\n        This is the character $\\chi_{-1,1}$. The values on $G$ are:\n        $\\chi_{-1,1}(1) = 1$\n        $\\chi_{-1,1}(3) = -1$\n        $\\chi_{-1,1}(5) = 1$\n        $\\chi_{-1,1}(7) = \\chi_{-1,1}(3)\\chi_{-1,1}(5) = (-1) \\cdot 1 = -1$.\n        So for $\\gcd(n,8)=1$, $\\chi_{-1,1}(n) = 1$ if $n \\equiv 1, 5 \\pmod{8}$ and $\\chi_{-1,1}(n) = -1$ if $n \\equiv 3, 7 \\pmod{8}$. Otherwise, $\\chi_{-1,1}(n)=0$.\n\n    -   **Character 3: Let $\\chi(3)=1$ and $\\chi(5)=-1$.**\n        This is the character $\\chi_{1,-1}$. The values on $G$ are:\n        $\\chi_{1,-1}(1) = 1$\n        $\\chi_{1,-1}(3) = 1$\n        $\\chi_{1,-1}(5) = -1$\n        $\\chi_{1,-1}(7) = \\chi_{1,-1}(3)\\chi_{1,-1}(5) = 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\n        So for $\\gcd(n,8)=1$, $\\chi_{1,-1}(n) = 1$ if $n \\equiv 1, 3 \\pmod{8}$ and $\\chi_{1,-1}(n) = -1$ if $n \\equiv 5, 7 \\pmod{8}$. Otherwise, $\\chi_{1,-1}(n)=0$.\n\n    -   **Character 4: Let $\\chi(3)=-1$ and $\\chi(5)=-1$.**\n        This is the character $\\chi_{-1,-1}$. The values on $G$ are:\n        $\\chi_{-1,-1}(1) = 1$\n        $\\chi_{-1,-1}(3) = -1$\n        $\\chi_{-1,-1}(5) = -1$\n        $\\chi_{-1,-1}(7) = \\chi_{-1,-1}(3)\\chi_{-1,-1}(5) = (-1) \\cdot (-1) = 1$.\n        So for $\\gcd(n,8)=1$, $\\chi_{-1,-1}(n) = 1$ if $n \\equiv 1, 7 \\pmod{8}$ and $\\chi_{-1,-1}(n) = -1$ if $n \\equiv 3, 5 \\pmod{8}$. Otherwise, $\\chi_{-1,-1}(n)=0$.\n\n2.  **Identification of the principal character**\n    The principal character, $\\chi_0$, is defined by $\\chi_0(n)=1$ for all $n$ with $\\gcd(n,8)=1$. From our construction, the character $\\chi_{1,1}$ takes the value $1$ on all elements of $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. Therefore, $\\chi_0 = \\chi_{1,1}$.\n\n3.  **Classification of characters by parity**\n    The parity of a character $\\chi$ is determined by the value of $\\chi(-1)$. Since $-1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$, we evaluate each character at $7$.\n    -   $\\chi_0(-1) = \\chi_{1,1}(7) = 1$. This character is **even**.\n    -   $\\chi_{-1,1}(-1) = \\chi_{-1,1}(7) = -1$. This character is **odd**.\n    -   $\\chi_{1,-1}(-1) = \\chi_{1,-1}(7) = -1$. This character is **odd**.\n    -   $\\chi_{-1,-1}(-1) = \\chi_{-1,-1}(7) = 1$. This character is **even**.\n\n4.  **Brief explanation regarding $L$-series**\n    The functional equation for a primitive Dirichlet $L$-series $L(s, \\chi)$ relates its value at $s$ to its value at $1-s$. It involves a \"completed\" $L$-function, $\\Lambda(s, \\chi)$, whose definition depends on the parity of $\\chi$. For a primitive character $\\chi$ with conductor $f$, the completed function is $\\Lambda(s, \\chi) = (\\pi/f)^{-(s+\\mathfrak{a})/2} \\Gamma((s+\\mathfrak{a})/2) L(s, \\chi)$, where the parameter $\\mathfrak{a}=0$ if $\\chi$ is even ($\\chi(-1)=1$) and $\\mathfrak{a}=1$ if $\\chi$ is odd ($\\chi(-1)=-1$). Thus, the parity directly governs the form of the Gamma factor in the functional equation.\n\n    The expression $\\prod_{\\chi\\neq\\chi_{0}}L(1,\\chi)^{(1-\\chi(-1))/2}$ involves the values of $L$-series at $s=1$. A fundamental theorem in number theory states that $L(1,\\chi) \\neq 0$ for any non-principal character $\\chi$. This non-vanishing property ensures that each factor $L(1,\\chi)$ in the product is a well-defined, non-zero complex number. The exponent $(1-\\chi(-1))/2$ is equal to $0$ for even characters and $1$ for odd characters. So, the expression simplifies to the product of $L(1,\\chi)$ over all non-principal odd characters. The non-vanishing theorem guarantees that this product is well-defined and not equal to zero.\n\nTo compute the final answer, we assemble the parity values for the characters in the specified order: $(\\chi_{0}(-1), \\chi_{-1,1}(-1), \\chi_{1,-1}(-1), \\chi_{-1,-1}(-1))$.\n$\\chi_0(-1) = 1$\n$\\chi_{-1,1}(-1) = -1$\n$\\chi_{1,-1}(-1) = -1$\n$\\chi_{-1,-1}(-1) = 1$\nThe resulting row matrix is $(1, -1, -1, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  -1  -1  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3084147"}, {"introduction": "Not all characters are 'fundamental' to their modulus; some are induced by simpler characters from a smaller modulus.

A complete reduced residue system modulo $15$ consists of all positive integers less than $15$ that are coprime to $15$. Since the prime factors of $15$ are $3$ and $5$, we seek integers $n$ such that $1 \\le n  15$ and $\\gcd(n, 15) = 1$. The elements of this set are $\\{1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14\\}$.

By definition, for any integer $n$ such that $\\gcd(n, q)=1$, we have $\\chi(n) = \\chi^{*}(n)$. The character $\\chi^{*}$ is defined by the values of $n$ modulo $3$: $\\chi^{*}(n)=1$ if $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, $\\chi^{*}(n)=-1$ if $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, and $\\chi^{*}(n)=0$ if $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nWe now compute $\\chi(n)$ for each $n$ in the reduced residue system $\\{1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14\\}$:\n- For $n=1$: $1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, so $\\chi(1) = \\chi^{*}(1) = 1$.\n- For $n=2$: $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, so $\\chi(2) = \\chi^{*}(2) = -1$.\n- For $n=4$: $4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, so $\\chi(4) = \\chi^{*}(4) = \\chi^{*}(1) = 1$.\n- For $n=7$: $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, so $\\chi(7) = \\chi^{*}(7) = \\chi^{*}(1) = 1$.\n- For $n=8$: $8 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, so $\\chi(8) = \\chi^{*}(8) = \\chi^{*}(2) = -1$.\n- For $n=11$: $11 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, so $\\chi(11) = \\chi^{*}(11) = \\chi^{*}(2) = -1$.\n- For $n=13$: $13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, so $\\chi(13) = \\chi^{*}(13) = \\chi^{*}(1) = 1$.\n- For $n=14$: $14 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, so $\\chi(14) = \\chi^{*}(14) = \\chi^{*}(2) = -1$.\n\nPart 2: Comparison of Euler products for $L(s,\\chi)$ and $L(s,\\chi^{*})$.\n\nFor a Dirichlet character $\\psi$, the associated L-series is defined for $\\Re(s)>1$ by the Euler product:\n$$L(s, \\psi) = \\prod_{p \\text{ prime}} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\psi(p)}{p^s}\\right)^{-1}$$\nFor the primitive character $\\chi^{*}$ modulo $f=3$, its L-series is:\n$$L(s, \\chi^{*}) = \\prod_{p} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\chi^{*}(p)}{p^s}\\right)^{-1}$$\nBy definition of $\\chi^{*}$, $\\chi^{*}(3)=0$. For any other prime $p$, $\\chi^{*}(p) \\neq 0$. Thus, the factor for $p=3$ is $(1-0)^{-1} = 1$, and the product can be written over primes $p \\neq 3$:\n$$L(s, \\chi^{*}) = \\prod_{p \\neq 3} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\chi^{*}(p)}{p^s}\\right)^{-1}$$\nFor the imprimitive character $\\chi$ modulo $q=15$, its L-series is:\n$$L(s, \\chi) = \\prod_{p} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p^s}\\right)^{-1}$$\nBy definition of $\\chi$, $\\chi(n)=0$ if $\\gcd(n,15) \\neq 1$. This means $\\chi(p)=0$ for any prime $p$ that divides $15$, namely $p=3$ and $p=5$. Thus, the factors for $p=3$ and $p=5$ are both $(1-0)^{-1}=1$. The product can be written over primes $p$ not dividing $15$:\n$$L(s, \\chi) = \\prod_{p \\nmid 15} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p^s}\\right)^{-1} = \\prod_{p \\neq 3, 5} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p^s}\\right)^{-1}$$\nFor primes $p$ such that $\\gcd(p,15)=1$, we have $\\chi(p) = \\chi^{*}(p)$. So we can write:\n$$L(s, \\chi) = \\prod_{p \\neq 3, 5} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\chi^{*}(p)}{p^s}\\right)^{-1}$$\nNow, we compare $L(s, \\chi)$ with $L(s, \\chi^{*})$.

The relationship between the two L-series is:\n$$L(s, \\chi) = L(s, \\chi^{*}) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\chi^{*}(5)}{5^s}\\right)$$\nThe multiplicative correction factor is $(1 - \\frac{\\chi^{*}(5)}{5^s})$.\n\nPart 3: Evaluation of the correction factor at $s=1$.\n\nWe set $s=1$ in the relationship derived above:\n$$L(1, \\chi) = L(1, \\chi^{*}) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\chi^{*}(5)}{5}\\right)$$\nTo evaluate the correction factor, we need the value of $\\chi^{*}(5)$. The character $\\chi^{*}$ is modulo $3$, so we evaluate its argument modulo $3$: $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\nFrom the definition of $\\chi^{*}$, we have $\\chi^{*}(2) = -1$.

Using our derived bound:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{9K} \\leq 5 \\times 10^{-7}\n$$\nSolving for $K$:\n$$\nK \\geq \\frac{1}{9 \\times 5 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{10^7}{45} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^6}{9}\n$$\n$$\nK \\geq 222222.222\\dots\n$$\nSince $K$ must be an integer, the smallest value of $K$ that satisfies this condition is $K=222223$.\n\nFor part 4, we are asked to find the exact value of $L(1,\\chi)$ and confirm it is non-zero. We start from the grouped series again:\n$$\nL(1,\\chi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{3k+1} - \\frac{1}{3k+2} \\right)\n$$\nTo use the properties of the digamma function $\\psi(z)$, we factor out a $3$ from the denominators:\n$$\nL(1,\\chi) = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{k+1/3} - \\frac{1}{k+2/3} \\right)\n$$\nThe digamma function $\\psi(z)$ has a series representation that leads to the following identity for $z_1, z_2$ not being non-positive integers:\n$$\n\\psi(z_1) - \\psi(z_2) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{k+z_2} - \\frac{1}{k+z_1} \\right)\n$$\nBy setting $z_2 = 1/3$ and $z_1 = 2/3$, we can identify our sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{k+1/3} - \\frac{1}{k+2/3} \\right) = \\psi(2/3) - \\psi(1/3)\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nL(1,\\chi) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\psi(2/3) - \\psi(1/3) \\right)\n$$\nNow, we use the reflection formula for the digamma function: $\\psi(1-z) - \\psi(z) = \\pi\\cot(\\pi z)$. Setting $z=1/3$:\n$$\n\\psi(1-1/3) - \\psi(1/3) = \\psi(2/3) - \\psi(1/3) = \\pi\\cot(\\pi/3)\n$$\nThe cotangent is $\\cot(\\pi/3) = \\frac{1}{\\tan(\\pi/3)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nSo, $\\psi(2/3) - \\psi(1/3) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $L(1,\\chi)$:\n$$\nL(1,\\chi) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nThis is the exact value of the series. Since $\\pi > 0$ and $\\sqrt{3} > 0$, it is evident that $L(1,\\chi) > 0$ and thus $L(1,\\chi) \\neq 0$.\n\nAs a final check, we can compute the decimal value. $L(1,\\chi) = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.604599788\\dots$. Rounded to six significant figures, this is $0.604600$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}}}$$", "id": "3084139"}]}
