Express your final expansion as a single summation expression (do not list terms individually) and give your answer in closed form. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard exercise in analytic number theory.\n\nLet the given finite product be denoted by $P(s)$, where $s$ is a complex variable with $\\Re(s) > 1$. The product is given by:\n$$ P(s) = \\prod_{p \\in \\{2,3,5\\}} (1 - p^{-s})^{-1} $$\nThis can be written explicitly as:\n$$ P(s) = (1 - 2^{-s})^{-1} (1 - 3^{-s})^{-1} (1 - 5^{-s})^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires us to use the geometric series identity $(1 - x)^{-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^{k}$, which is valid for any complex number $x$ with $|x|  1$. We must first verify that this condition holds for each factor in our product.\n\nFor a term $(1 - p^{-s})^{-1}$, the corresponding value of $x$ is $p^{-s}$. We need to check if $|p^{-s}|  1$. The complex variable $s$ can be written as $s = \\sigma + it$, where $\\sigma = \\Re(s)$ and $t = \\Im(s)$ are real numbers. We are given $\\sigma > 1$. The magnitude of $p^{-s}$ is:\n$$ |p^{-s}| = |p^{-(\\sigma + it)}| = |p^{-\\sigma} p^{-it}| = |p^{-\\sigma}| |p^{-it}| $$\nThe term $|p^{-\\sigma}|$ is simply $p^{-\\sigma}$ since $p$ and $\\sigma$ are real. The term $p^{-it}$ can be written using Euler's identity as $\\exp(-it \\ln p) = \\cos(-t \\ln p) + i \\sin(-t \\ln p)$. The magnitude of this complex exponential is always $1$:\n$$ |\\exp(-it \\ln p)| = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(-t \\ln p) + \\sin^2(-t \\ln p)} = 1 $$\nTherefore, the magnitude of $p^{-s}$ simplifies to:\n$$ |p^{-s}| = p^{-\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{p^{\\sigma}} $$\nSince the primes $p$ are $2$, $3$, and $5$, $p \\ge 2$. Given $\\sigma = \\Re(s) > 1$, we have $p^{\\sigma} > p^1 \\ge 2$. This implies:\n$$ |p^{-s}| = \\frac{1}{p^{\\sigma}}  \\frac{1}{2}  1 $$\nThe condition for the convergence of the geometric series is satisfied for each prime factor in the product. We can now expand each term:\n$$ (1 - 2^{-s})^{-1} = \\sum_{a=0}^{\\infty} (2^{-s})^{a} = \\sum_{a=0}^{\\infty} 2^{-as} $$\n$$ (1 - 3^{-s})^{-1} = \\sum_{b=0}^{\\infty} (3^{-s})^{b} = \\sum_{b=0}^{\\infty} 3^{-bs} $$\n$$ (1 - 5^{-s})^{-1} = \\sum_{c=0}^{\\infty} (5^{-s})^{c} = \\sum_{c=0}^{\\infty} 5^{-cs} $$\nSubstituting these series back into the product expression for $P(s)$:\n$$ P(s) = \\left( \\sum_{a=0}^{\\infty} 2^{-as} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{b=0}^{\\infty} 3^{-bs} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{c=0}^{\\infty} 5^{-cs} \\right) $$\nSince each of these series is absolutely convergent for $\\Re(s)1$, we can multiply them term by term and rearrange the terms in any order. This is a property of the Cauchy product of absolutely convergent series. The general term in the resulting expansion is the product of one term from each series:\n$$ (2^{-as}) (3^{-bs}) (5^{-cs}) $$\nfor some choice of non-negative integers $a, b, c$. Using the law of exponents $(x^z y^z = (xy)^z)$, we can combine these as:\n$$ 2^{-as} 3^{-bs} 5^{-cs} = (2^a)^{-s} (3^b)^{-s} (5^c)^{-s} = (2^a 3^b 5^c)^{-s} $$\nThe full expansion is the sum over all possible combinations of the non-negative integers $a, b, c$:\n$$ P(s) = \\sum_{a=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{b=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{c=0}^{\\infty} (2^a 3^b 5^c)^{-s} $$\nThis expression is a Dirichlet series. The problem asks us to identify the integers $n$ that appear as the bases of the terms $n^{-s}$. From the expression above, these integers are all numbers $n$ that can be written in the form:\n$$ n = 2^a 3^b 5^c $$\nwhere $a, b,$ and $c$ are non-negative integers (i.e., $a, b, c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$).\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every positive integer has a unique prime factorization. This implies that each distinct triplet of exponents $(a, b, c)$ corresponds to a unique integer $n$. Conversely, any integer $n$ whose prime factors are exclusively from the set $\\{2, 3, 5\\}$ can be expressed in this form. Such integers are known as $5$-smooth or $\\{2,3,5\\}$-friable numbers.\n\nFor example, if $(a,b,c)=(1,1,0)$, $n=2^1 3^1 5^0 = 6$, giving the term $6^{-s}$. If $(a,b,c)=(0,0,0)$, $n=2^0 3^0 5^0 = 1$, giving the term $1^{-s}$. An integer like $7$ cannot be formed this way, so the term $7^{-s}$ does not appear in the expansion.\n\nThe final expansion, written as a single summation expression, is the nested sum derived above, which accounts for all terms $n^{-s}$ where $n$ is a $5$-smooth number.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\sum_{a=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{b=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{c=0}^{\\infty} (2^{a} 3^{b} 5^{c})^{-s}} $$", "id": "3090926"}, {"introduction": "This final practice bridges the gap between abstract theory and tangible application.

Motivation of the Euler Product Formula**\n\nThe Riemann zeta function is defined for any real number $s > 1$ as the sum of the infinite series:\n$$\n\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^s} = \\frac{1}{1^s} + \\frac{1}{2^s} + \\frac{1}{3^s} + \\frac{1}{4^s} + \\dots\n$$\nFor $s > 1$, this series is absolutely convergent. This property is crucial as it allows us to rearrange and regroup the terms of the series without changing its sum.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that any integer $n \\geq 2$ can be written as a unique product of prime powers: $n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$. This unique factorization is the key to connecting the sum over integers to a product over primes.\n\nConsider the product over all prime numbers $p$ of the terms $(1 - p^{-s})^{-1}$. Using the formula for a geometric series, $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^k = (1-x)^{-1}$, which is valid for $|x|  1$, we can expand each term in the product. For any prime $p \\geq 2$ and any $s > 1$, we have $0  p^{-s} \\leq 2^{-s}  1$, so the geometric series converges.\n$$\n(1 - p^{-s})^{-1} = 1 + p^{-s} + p^{-2s} + p^{-3s} + \\dots = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(p^k)^s}\n$$\nThe Euler product is the product of these series over all primes $p$:\n$$\n\\prod_{p \\text{ prime}} (1 - p^{-s})^{-1} = \\prod_{p \\text{ prime}} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} p^{-ks} \\right)\n$$\nLet's expand this product for the first few primes, $p_1=2$, $p_2=3$, $p_3=5, \\dots$:\n$$\n\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2^s} + \\frac{1}{4^s} + \\dots\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3^s} + \\frac{1}{9^s} + \\dots\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{5^s} + \\frac{1}{25^s} + \\dots\\right) \\cdots\n$$\nWhen we multiply these series together, a generic term in the resulting sum is formed by picking one term from each series, for instance $p_1^{-k_1 s}$, $p_2^{-k_2 s}$, etc. This gives a term of the form:\n$$\n(p_1^{k_1})^{-s} (p_2^{k_2})^{-s} \\cdots (p_r^{k_r})^{-s} = (p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_r^{k_r})^{-s}\n$$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, any integer $n \\ge 1$ (where $n=1$ corresponds to choosing $k_i=0$ for all primes) has a unique representation as a product of prime powers. Therefore, each term $n^{-s}$ appears exactly once in the expansion of the product. The absolute convergence of $\\zeta(s)$ justifies this formal expansion and rearrangement. Thus, we arrive at the Euler product formula:\n$$\n\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^s} = \\prod_{p \\text{ prime}} (1 - p^{-s})^{-1}\n$$\n\n**2. Finite Approximation and Error Bound for $\\zeta(2)$**\n\nFor the specific case $s=2$, the formula is $\\zeta(2) = \\prod_{p} (1 - p^{-2})^{-1}$. The problem defines a finite approximation $A_P$ by taking the product over primes up to a certain bound $P$:\n$$\nA_P = \\prod_{p \\le P} (1 - p^{-2})^{-1}\n$$\nThe full value $\\zeta(2)$ can be split into two parts: the product up to $P$ and the tail product for primes greater than $P$.\n$$\n\\zeta(2) = \\left( \\prod_{p \\le P} (1 - p^{-2})^{-1} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{p > P} (1 - p^{-2})^{-1} \\right) = A_P \\cdot T_P\n$$\nwhere $T_P = \\prod_{p > P} (1 - p^{-2})^{-1}$. The relative error of the approximation $A_P$ with respect to $\\zeta(2)$ can be expressed as $\\frac{\\zeta(2) - A_P}{A_P} = \\frac{A_P T_P - A_P}{A_P} = T_P - 1$.\n\nTo bound this error, we analyze the tail product $T_P$. Expanding $T_P$ using the geometric series as before gives:\n$$\nT_P = \\prod_{p > P} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} p^{-2k} \\right) = \\sum_{n \\in S_P} \\frac{1}{n^2}\n$$\nwhere $S_P$ is the set of integers whose prime factors are all strictly greater than $P$. This set includes $1$ (the empty product of primes), and all other elements are integers $n > 1$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\nT_P = 1 + \\sum_{n \\in S_P, n > 1} \\frac{1}{n^2}\n$$\nThe relative error is precisely this sum:\n$$\nT_P - 1 = \\sum_{n \\in S_P, n > 1} \\frac{1}{n^2}\n$$\nLet $Q$ be the smallest prime strictly greater than $P$. Any integer $n \\in S_P$ with $n>1$ must be composed of primes that are all $\\ge Q$. The smallest such integer is $Q$ itself. Thus, every integer $n$ in the sum is greater than or equal to $Q$. The set $\\{n \\in S_P, n > 1\\}$ is a subset of the set of all integers $\\{Q, Q+1, Q+2, \\dots\\}$. Since all terms are positive, we can establish an upper bound by summing over all integers from $Q$ onwards:\n$$\n\\text{Relative Error} = T_P - 1 \\le \\sum_{n=Q}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2}\n$$\nWe now use the integral test to bound this tail sum. The function $f(x) = x^{-2}$ is positive, continuous, and decreasing for $x \\ge 1$. The sum can be bounded by an integral as follows:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=Q}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} \\le \\int_{Q-1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{Q-1}^{\\infty} x^{-2} dx = \\left[ -x^{-1} \\right]_{Q-1}^{\\infty} = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{1}{b} \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{1}{Q-1} \\right) = 0 + \\frac{1}{Q-1} = \\frac{1}{Q-1}\n$$\nThis proves that the relative error is bounded above by $E_{\\text{rel}}(P) = \\frac{1}{Q-1}$.\n\nThe absolute error is $|\\zeta(2) - A_P| = \\zeta(2) - A_P = A_P(T_P - 1)$. Using the bound for the relative error, we obtain an upper bound for the absolute error:\n$$\n|\\zeta(2) - A_P| \\le A_P \\cdot \\frac{1}{Q-1}\n$$\nThis is the specified absolute error upper bound, $E_{\\text{abs}}(P) = A_P \\cdot \\frac{1}{Q-1}$.\n\n**3. Numerical Computations**\n\nFor the implementation, we need a method to generate primes up to $P$ and find the next prime $Q > P$. A primality test based on trial division is sufficient for the given range of $P$.\n\nThe computations for each test case are as follows:\n- For $P=1$: There are no primes $p \\le 1$. The empty product is defined as $1$, so $A_1 = 1$. The smallest prime greater than $1$ is $Q=2$. The relative error bound is $E_{\\text{rel}}(1) = 1/(2-1) = 1$. The absolute error bound is $E_{\\text{abs}}(1) = A_1 \\cdot E_{\\text{rel}}(1) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n- For $P=2$: The only prime $p \\le 2$ is $2$. Thus, $A_2 = (1 - 2^{-2})^{-1} = (1 - 1/4)^{-1} = (3/4)^{-1} = 4/3 \\approx 1.333333333333$. The next prime is $Q=3$. The relative error bound is $E_{\\text{rel}}(2) = 1/(3-1) = 0.5$. The absolute error bound is $E_{\\text{abs}}(2) = (4/3) \\cdot 0.5 = 2/3 \\approx 0.666666666667$.\n- For $P=13$: The primes are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13$. The next prime is $Q=17$.\n  $A_{13} = \\prod_{p \\in \\{2,3,5,7,11,13\\}} (1-p^{-2})^{-1} \\approx 1.621996598502$.\n  $E_{\\text{rel}}(13) = 1/(17-1) = 1/16 = 0.0625$.\n  $E_{\\text{abs}}(13) = A_{13} \\cdot (1/16) \\approx 0.101374787406$.\n- For $P=29$: The primes are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29$. The next prime is $Q=31$.\n  $A_{29} = \\prod_{p \\le 29} (1-p^{-2})^{-1} \\approx 1.637774136611$.\n  $E_{\\text{rel}}(29) = 1/(31-1) = 1/30 \\approx 0.033333333333$.\n  $E_{\\text{abs}}(29) = A_{29} \\cdot (1/30) \\approx 0.054592471220$.\n\nThe program will automate these calculations and format the output as specified.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes finite multiplicative approximations to zeta(2) and their error bounds.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def is_prime(n):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if an integer n is a prime number.\n        \"\"\"\n        if n  2:\n            return False\n        if n == 2 or n == 3:\n            return True\n        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n            return False\n        i = 5\n        # Trial division up to sqrt(n)\n        while i * i = n:\n            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n                return False\n            i += 6\n        return True\n\n    def get_primes_up_to(P):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates a list of prime numbers less than or equal to P.\n        \"\"\"\n        if P  2:\n            return []\n        primes_list = []\n        for i in range(2, P + 1):\n            if is_prime(i):\n                primes_list.append(i)\n        return primes_list\n\n    def get_next_prime(P):\n        \"\"\"\n        Finds the smallest prime number strictly greater than P.\n        \"\"\"\n        q = P + 1\n        while True:\n            if is_prime(q):\n                return q\n            q += 1\n\n    # Test suite from the problem statement\n    test_cases = [1, 2, 13, 29]\n    all_results = []\n\n    for P in test_cases:\n        # Task 1: Compute the finite multiplicative approximation Ap\n        primes = get_primes_up_to(P)\n        \n        if not primes:\n            # The empty product is defined as 1\n            Ap = 1.0\n        else:\n            factors = [(1.0 - p**-2)**-1 for p in primes]\n            Ap = np.prod(factors)\n\n        # Task 2: Compute the error bounds\n        # Find Q, the smallest prime strictly greater than P\n        Q = get_next_prime(P)\n\n        # Compute the relative error upper bound, E_rel(P) = 1/(Q-1)\n        E_rel = 1.0 / (Q - 1)\n\n        # Compute the absolute error upper bound, E_abs(P) = Ap * E_rel\n        E_abs = Ap * E_rel\n        \n        # Store the triple [Ap, E_abs, E_rel]\n        # The values are kept as high-precision floats until final formatting.\n        result_triple = [Ap, E_abs, E_rel]\n        all_results.append(result_triple)\n\n    # Format the final output string according to the specified format.\n    # The output must be rounded to 12 decimal places.\n    # e.g., [[a_1,b_1,c_1],[a_2,b_2,c_2],...]\n    inner_strings = []\n    for triple in all_results:\n        # Round each value to 12 decimal places and format the string.\n        # The f-string format specifier ensures 12 digits are printed, even if trailing zeros.\n        f_Ap = f\"{round(triple[0], 12):.12f}\"\n        f_E_abs = f\"{round(triple[1], 12):.12f}\"\n        f_E_rel = f\"{round(triple[2], 12):.12f}\"\n        inner_strings.append(f\"[{f_Ap},{f_E_abs},{f_E_rel}]\")\n    \n    # Combine the inner lists into the final output string.\n    output_str = f\"[{','.join(inner_strings)}]\"\n    \n    # Print the final result to stdout.\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3090908"}]}
