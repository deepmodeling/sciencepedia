It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question in elementary analysis and number theory. It is self-contained, objective, and free from any scientific or mathematical flaws.\n\nThe problem asks for an upper bound on the tail of the Riemann zeta function series, and then to use this bound to find a specific truncation number $N$.\n\nLet $\\sigma  1$ be a real number. The Riemann zeta function is defined as $\\zeta(\\sigma) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-\\sigma}$. The tail of the series after $N$ terms is given by\n$$ R_{N}(\\sigma) = \\zeta(\\sigma) - S_{N}(\\sigma) = \\sum_{n=N+1}^{\\infty} n^{-\\sigma} $$\nwhere $S_{N}(\\sigma) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n^{-\\sigma}$.\n\nWe are asked to derive an upper bound for $R_{N}(\\sigma)$ using an integral comparison. Let the function $f(x) = x^{-\\sigma}$. For $\\sigma  1$ and $x  0$, this function is positive, continuous, and strictly decreasing. The sum $R_{N}(\\sigma)$ can be interpreted as the sum of areas of rectangles. Specifically, the term $n^{-\\sigma}$ is the area of a rectangle with width $1$ (from $n-1$ to $n$) and height $n^{-\\sigma}$.\n\nFor any integer $n \\geq 1$, and for any $x$ in the interval $[n-1, n]$, the decreasing property of $f(x)$ implies $x \\le n$, and therefore $x^{-\\sigma} \\ge n^{-\\sigma}$. Integrating this inequality over the interval $[n-1, n]$ gives:\n$$ \\int_{n-1}^{n} x^{-\\sigma} \\,dx \\ge \\int_{n-1}^{n} n^{-\\sigma} \\,dx = n^{-\\sigma} \\cdot (n - (n-1)) = n^{-\\sigma} $$\nThis inequality, $n^{-\\sigma} \\le \\int_{n-1}^{n} x^{-\\sigma} \\,dx$, relates each term of the sum to an integral.\n\nWe can apply this to the tail sum $R_{N}(\\sigma)$ by summing from $n = N+1$ to $\\infty$:\n$$ R_{N}(\\sigma) = \\sum_{n=N+1}^{\\infty} n^{-\\sigma} \\le \\sum_{n=N+1}^{\\infty} \\int_{n-1}^{n} x^{-\\sigma} \\,dx $$\nThe sum of integrals on the right-hand side is a sum over adjacent intervals, which can be combined into a single integral:\n$$ \\sum_{n=N+1}^{\\infty} \\int_{n-1}^{n} x^{-\\sigma} \\,dx = \\int_{N}^{N+1} x^{-\\sigma} \\,dx + \\int_{N+1}^{N+2} x^{-\\sigma} \\,dx + \\dots = \\int_{N}^{\\infty} x^{-\\sigma} \\,dx $$\nThus, we have established the upper bound:\n$$ R_{N}(\\sigma) \\le \\int_{N}^{\\infty} x^{-\\sigma} \\,dx $$\nNow, we evaluate the improper integral. Since $\\sigma  1$, we have $1-\\sigma \\neq 0$.\n$$ \\int_{N}^{\\infty} x^{-\\sigma} \\,dx = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\int_{N}^{M} x^{-\\sigma} \\,dx = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{x^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma} \\right]_{N}^{M} = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{M^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma} - \\frac{N^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma} \\right) $$\nBecause $\\sigma  1$, the exponent $1-\\sigma$ is negative. Therefore, as $M \\to \\infty$, the term $M^{1-\\sigma} \\to 0$. The integral evaluates to:\n$$ 0 - \\frac{N^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma} = \\frac{N^{1-\\sigma}}{\\sigma - 1} $$\nSo, we have derived the closed-form upper bound $B(\\sigma, N)$:\n$$ R_{N}(\\sigma) \\le \\frac{N^{1-\\sigma}}{\\sigma-1} = B(\\sigma, N) $$\nNext, we specialize to the case $\\sigma = 2$. The quantity to be bounded is $|\\zeta(2) - \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{n^2}| = R_{N}(2)$. We require this to be less than or equal to $10^{-6}$.\nUsing the derived bound, we enforce the condition on $B(2, N)$:\n$$ R_N(2) \\le B(2, N) \\le 10^{-6} $$\nFor $\\sigma=2$, the bound is:\n$$ B(2, N) = \\frac{N^{1-2}}{2-1} = \\frac{N^{-1}}{1} = \\frac{1}{N} $$\nThe inequality becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N} \\le 10^{-6} $$\nSolving for $N$, we find:\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{1}{10^{-6}} = 10^6 $$\nThe least integer $N$ that satisfies this condition is $N=10^6$.\n\nFinally, a brief note on the relevance of such bounds. The Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is a conjecture about the zeros of $\\zeta(s)$ for complex $s$, specifically in the \"critical strip\" $0 \\le \\operatorname{Re}(s) \\le 1$. However, the defining series $\\sum n^{-s}$ only converges for $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  1$. To study $\\zeta(s)$ in the critical strip, one must first perform an analytic continuation. This is often achieved by deriving integral representations of $\\zeta(s)$.\nThe derivation of such integral representations (e.g., via the Euler-Maclaurin formula) relies on rigorously controlling the partial sums $S_N(s)$ and the remainder tails $R_N(s)$ in the half-plane of convergence $\\operatorname{Re}(s)1$. The ability to find explicit, effective bounds on $R_N(s)$, like the one derived here, is a crucial first step. It validates the limiting processes used to establish the analytic continuation and provides the groundwork for developing more sophisticated estimates on the magnitude of $|\\zeta(s)|$ across the complex plane.

However, the series for $\\eta(s)$ converges for all $s$ with $\\Re(s)  0$, defining an analytic function in that half-plane. The function $(1 - 2^{1-s})$ is an entire function. By the principle of analytic continuation, the relation $\\zeta(s) = \\frac{\\eta(s)}{1 - 2^{1-s}}$ extends the definition of $\\zeta(s)$ meromorphically to the entire complex plane, with possible poles where $1 - 2^{1-s} = 0$.

This sum corresponds formally to $\\eta(-1)$. We consider the power series $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{n-1} n x^{n}$ for $|x|  1$.
