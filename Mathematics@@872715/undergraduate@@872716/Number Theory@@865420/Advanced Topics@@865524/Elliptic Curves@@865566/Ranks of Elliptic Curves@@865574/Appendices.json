It is self-contained, mathematically sound, and well-posed within the established framework of number theory concerning elliptic curves. The tasks are specific and admit unique, verifiable solutions based on standard definitions and formulas.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis of the elliptic curve $E$ defined over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ by the equation $y^{2}=x^{3}-x$.\n\nPart 1: Computation of the discriminant and verification of nonsingularity.\n\nThe given equation for the elliptic curve $E$ is $y^{2}=x^{3}-x$. This is in the short Weierstrass form $y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b$. By comparing the coefficients of the given equation with the general form, we identify the parameters $a$ and $b$ for this specific curve:\n$$a = -1$$\n$$b = 0$$\n\nThe discriminant of an elliptic curve in short Weierstrass form is given by the formula:\n$$\\Delta = -16(4a^{3} + 27b^{2})$$\n\nSubstituting the values $a=-1$ and $b=0$ for the curve $E$, we compute its discriminant, denoted $\\Delta(E)$:\n$$\\Delta(E) = -16(4(-1)^{3} + 27(0)^{2})$$\n$$\\Delta(E) = -16(4(-1) + 27(0))$$\n$$\\Delta(E) = -16(-4 + 0)$$\n$$\\Delta(E) = -16(-4)$$\n$$\\Delta(E) = 64$$\n\nAn elliptic curve defined by a Weierstrass equation is nonsingular if and only if its discriminant is non-zero. Since the discriminant of $E$ is $\\Delta(E) = 64$, which is not equal to $0$, the curve $E$ is nonsingular over any field whose characteristic does not divide $2\\Delta$. As we are working over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which has characteristic $0$, the condition $\\Delta(E) \\neq 0$ is sufficient to confirm that $E$ is a nonsingular curve, and thus a valid elliptic curve.\n\nPart 2: Identification of the identity element in projective coordinates.\n\nAn elliptic curve is formally defined as a nonsingular cubic curve in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^{2}$ with a specified rational point. The affine equation $y^{2}=x^{3}-x$ describes the points of the curve in the affine plane. To find all points, including those \"at infinity,\" we must work in projective coordinates.\n\nWe homogenize the affine equation by introducing a third coordinate $Z$ and setting $x = X/Z$ and $y = Y/Z$. Substituting these into the equation of $E$ gives:\n$$\\left(\\frac{Y}{Z}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{X}{Z}\\right)^{3} - \\frac{X}{Z}$$\n$$\\frac{Y^{2}}{Z^{2}} = \\frac{X^{3}}{Z^{3}} - \\frac{X}{Z}$$\nTo clear the denominators, we multiply the entire equation by $Z^{3}$, which is the lowest common multiple of the denominators' degrees:\n$$Z^{3}\\left(\\frac{Y^{2}}{Z^{2}}\\right) = Z^{3}\\left(\\frac{X^{3}}{Z^{3}}\\right) - Z^{3}\\left(\\frac{X}{Z}\\right)$$\n$$Y^{2}Z = X^{3} - XZ^{2}$$\nThis is the equation for $E$ in homogeneous projective coordinates $[X:Y:Z]$. The affine points $(x,y)$ of the original curve correspond to the projective points $[x:y:1]$.\n\nThe \"points at infinity\" are those for which $Z=0$. Substituting $Z=0$ into the homogeneous equation:\n$$Y^{2}(0) = X^{3} - X(0)^{2}$$\n$$0 = X^{3}$$\nThis implies that $X=0$. Thus, any point at infinity on the curve $E$ must have coordinates of the form $[0:Y:0]$. In projective coordinates, at least one coordinate must be non-zero. Therefore, we must have $Y \\neq 0$.\n\nAll points $[0:Y:0]$ with $Y \\neq 0$ are equivalent, as they can be scaled by a non-zero constant. For example, scaling by $1/Y$ gives:\n$$[0:Y:0] \\sim \\left[0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{Y} : Y \\cdot \\frac{1}{Y} : 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{Y}\\right] = [0:1:0]$$\nThis shows that there is a single, unique point at infinity on the curve $E$. By convention and for the geometric construction of the group law, this unique point at infinity is designated as the identity element for the group of rational points $E(\\mathbb{Q})$. We denote this point as $P_{0}$.\n\nTherefore, the identity element is $P_{0} = [0:1:0]$.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the discriminant $\\Delta(E) = 64$ and the identity point $P_{0} = [0:1:0]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 64 & [0:1:0] \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3089254"}, {"introduction": "Directly computing the rank of an elliptic curve is a formidable task.

The two-torsion points $E[2]$ are the points of order dividing two. These are the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$, and the points with $y$-coordinate $0$.\nSetting $y=0$, we get $x(x-1)(x+1)=0$, which yields the rational roots $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$.\nThe rational two-torsion points are:\n$T_1 = (0,0)$, $T_2 = (1,0)$, and $T_3 = (-1,0)$.\nAlong with $\\mathcal{O}$, these four points form the group $E(\\mathbb{Q})[2] \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. Let's denote the $x$-coordinates as $e_1=0$, $e_2=1$, and $e_3=-1$.\n\nThe two-descent is mediated by the Kummer map $\\delta: E(\\mathbb{Q}) \\to (\\mathbb{Q}^\\times/(\\mathbb{Q}^\\times)^2)^2$, defined (up to a choice of basis for $E[2]$) by:\nFor a point $P=(x,y) \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})$ where $y \\ne 0$:\n$$ \\delta(P) = (x-e_1, x-e_2) \\pmod{(\\mathbb{Q}^\\times)^2} = (x, x-1) \\pmod{(\\mathbb{Q}^\\times)^2} $$\nThe map is extended to the torsion points.

Let $d_3$ be defined by the relation $d_3 \\equiv d_1 d_2 \\pmod{(\\mathbb{Q}^\\times)^2}$. The existence of a point $(x,y)$ on $E$ corresponding to $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$ implies the existence of $u,v,w \\in \\mathbb{Q}^\\times$ such that:\n$$ x-e_1 = d_1 u^2 \\implies x = d_1 u^2 $$\n$$ x-e_2 = d_2 v^2 \\implies x-1 = d_2 v^2 $$\n$$ x-e_3 = d_3 w^2 \\implies x+1 = d_1d_2 w^2 $$\nFor a given pair of square-free integers $(d_1, d_2)$, we must check if this system of equations has a solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_v$ for all places $v$.\n\nThe discriminant of $E$ is $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2) = -16(4(-1)^3 + 27(0)^2) = 64 = 2^6$. A standard result states that we only need to check for local solubility at the places of bad reduction and at $v=\\infty$. The only prime of bad reduction is $p=2$. Thus, we only need to check for solutions in $\\mathbb{R}$ (for $v=\\infty$) and $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ (for $v=2$).\n\nFurthermore, the square-free integer representatives for $d_1$ and $d_2$ can only have prime factors that divide the discriminant $\\Delta$. In this case, the only prime factor is $2$. Thus, we only need to consider $d_1, d_2 \\in \\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\}$. This gives $4 \\times 4 = 16$ candidate pairs $(d_1, d_2)$ to test.\n\n**Step 3: Local Solubility Analysis**\n\nWe test the $16$ pairs for local solubility. A pair $(d_1, d_2)$ corresponds to an element of the Selmer group if there exists an $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_v$ such that $x/d_1$, $(x-1)/d_2$, and $(x+1)/(d_1 d_2)$ are all squares in $\\mathbb{Q}_v$ for $v=\\infty, 2$.\n\n**Analysis over $\\mathbb{R}$ ($v=\\infty$)**:\nA number is a square in $\\mathbb{R}$ if it is non-negative. We need to find $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n$$ d_1 x \\ge 0, \\quad d_2 (x-1) \\ge 0, \\quad d_1 d_2 (x+1) \\ge 0 $$\nIf $d_1$ and $d_2$ have opposite signs, these conditions are contradictory. For example, if $d_1 > 0$ and $d_2  0$, the first two inequalities require $0 \\le x \\le 1$. But then $d_1d_2  0$ and $x+1 > 0$, so the third inequality $d_1d_2(x+1) \\ge 0$ fails. If $d_1  0$ and $d_2 > 0$, the first two inequalities require $x \\le 0$ and $x \\ge 1$, which is impossible. Therefore, all 8 pairs where $d_1$ and $d_2$ have opposite signs are eliminated.\n\nThis leaves $16-8=8$ pairs surviving the test at $v=\\infty$:\n- $d_10, d_20$: $(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)$\n- $d_10, d_20$: $(-1,-1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1), (-2,-2)$\n\n**Analysis over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ ($v=2$)**:\nA number $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2$ is a square if and only if its 2-adic valuation $v_2(q)$ is an even integer and its unit part, $q/2^{v_2(q)}$, is congruent to $1$ modulo $8$.\n\nWe test the $8$ surviving pairs.\n1.  **$(1,1)$**: $d_1=1, d_2=1, d_3=1$. Requires $x, x-1, x+1$ to be squares. This is the trivial element $\\delta(\\mathcal{O})$ and must pass. Indeed, it corresponds to the point at infinity. It passes.\n2.  **$(1,2)$**: $d_1=1, d_2=2, d_3=2$. Requires $x, (x-1)/2, (x+1)/2$ to be squares. This is $\\delta(1,0)$. Let $x=1$. Then $x=1^2$, $(x-1)/2=0=0^2$, and $(x+1)/2=1=1^2$. All are squares. This corresponds to the rational point $(1,0)$ on $E$. It passes.\n3.  **$(-1,-1)$**: $d_1=-1, d_2=-1, d_3=1$. Requires $-x, -(x-1), x+1$ to be squares. This is $\\delta(0,0)$. Let $x=0$. Then $-x=0$, $-(x-1)=1$, $x+1=1$. All are squares. It passes.\n4.  **$(-1,-2)$**: $d_1=-1, d_2=-2, d_3=2$. Requires $-x, -(x-1)/2, (x+1)/2$ to be squares. This is $\\delta(-1,0)$. Let $x=-1$. Then $-x=1$, $-(x-1)/2=1$, $(x+1)/2=0$. All are squares. It passes.\n\nNow we check the remaining four pairs.\n5.  **$(2,1)$**: $d_1=2, d_2=1, d_3=2$. Requires $x/2, x-1, (x+1)/2$ to be squares. Let $x=2u^2$ and $x-1=v^2$. Substituting $x$ gives $2u^2-1=v^2$. Let $x+1=2w^2$. Adding this to the previous equation gives $2x = v^2+2w^2-1$. Substituting $x=2u^2$ gives $4u^2 = v^2+2w^2-1$. A simpler approach is to eliminate $x$: from $x=v^2+1$ and $x=2u^2$, we get $v^2+1=2u^2$. From $x=2w^2-1$, we get $v^2+1=2w^2-1 \\implies v^2-2w^2=-2$. Combining $v^2=2u^2-1$ and $v^2=2w^2-2$ gives $2u^2-1 = 2w^2-2 \\implies 2(w^2-u^2)=1$. This has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ because the 2-adic valuation of the left side is at least 1, while $v_2(1)=0$. Thus, $(2,1)$ fails.\n6.  **$(2,2)$**: $d_1=2, d_2=2, d_3=1$. Requires $x/2, (x-1)/2, x+1$ to be squares. Let $x=2u^2$ and $x-1=2v^2$. Subtracting these equations gives $(x) - (x-1) = 2u^2 - 2v^2$, which simplifies to $1 = 2(u^2-v^2)$. This equation has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, because the 2-adic valuation of the left side is $v_2(1)=0$, while the valuation of the right side is $v_2(2(u^2-v^2)) = 1+v_2(u^2-v^2)$, which is at least 1. This is a contradiction. Thus, $(2,2)$ fails.\n7.  **$(-2,-1)$**: $d_1=-2, d_2=-1, d_3=2$. Requires $-x/2, 1-x, (x+1)/2$ to be squares. Let $x=-2u^2$. This gives $1+2u^2=v^2$ and $(1-2u^2)/2=w^2 \\implies 1-2u^2=2w^2$. From $v^2-2u^2=1$, any solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ requires $u$ to be even (if $u$ were a unit, $v^2 \\equiv 1+2=3 \\pmod 8$, impossible). So let $u=2k$. Then $v$ is a unit. Substituting into the second equation: $1-2(4k^2) = 1-8k^2 = 2w^2$. The LHS is a unit congruent to $1 \\pmod 8$. For the RHS to be a unit, $w$ must be a unit, so $2w^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 8$. The equation becomes $1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 8$, a contradiction. Thus, $(-2,-1)$ fails.\n8.  **$(-2,-2)$**: $d_1=-2, d_2=-2, d_3=1$. Requires $-x/2, (1-x)/2, x+1$ to be squares. Let $x=-2u^2$. This gives $(1+2u^2)/2=v^2 \\implies 1+2u^2=2v^2$ and $1-2u^2=w^2$. From $w^2+2u^2=1$, any solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ must have $u$ even and $w$ a unit. So let $u=2k$. Substituting into the first equation: $1+8k^2=2v^2$. The LHS is a unit congruent to $1 \\pmod 8$. The RHS is $2v^2$. As before, this leads to the contradiction $1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 8$ (if $v$ is a unit) or $1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ (if $v$ is not a unit). Thus, $(-2,-2)$ fails.\n\n**Conclusion: The Selmer Group**\n\nThe pairs $(d_1, d_2)$ that survive all local conditions are:\n$$ (1,1), \\quad (1,2), \\quad (-1,-1), \\quad (-1,-2) $$\nThese four pairs constitute the second Selmer group $\\mathrm{Sel}^{(2)}(E/\\mathbb{Q})$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We proceed to solve it.\n\nThe elliptic curve $E$ is given over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by the short Weierstrass equation $y^{2}=x^{3}-x$. We are asked to compute its global root number $w(E)$ and state the resulting prediction for the parity of its Mordell–Weil rank, $r(E)$. The global root number is the product of local root numbers, $w(E) = \\prod_{v} w_{v}(E)$, over all places $v$ of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**1. Local Root Number at the Real Place, $w_{\\infty}(E)$**\n\nThe local root number at the real place, $w_{\\infty}(E)$, is determined by the number of connected components of the real locus $E(\\mathbb{R})$. The real points $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ on the curve must satisfy $y^{2} \\ge 0$, which implies that the polynomial $P(x) = x^{3}-x$ must be non-negative.\nWe factor the polynomial as $P(x) = x(x-1)(x+1)$. The roots are $x = -1$, $x = 0$, and $x = 1$. We analyze the sign of $P(x)$ on the real line:\n- For $x  1$, all factors are positive, so $P(x)  0$.\n- For $0  x  1$, $x  0$, $x-1  0$, and $x+1  0$, so $P(x)  0$. There are no real points in this range for $x$.\n- For $-1  x  0$, $x  0$, $x-1  0$, and $x+1  0$, so $P(x)  0$.\n- For $x  -1$, all three factors are negative, so $P(x)  0$. There are no real points in this range for $x$.\n\nThe set of real points $E(\\mathbb{R})$ exists only for $x \\in [-1, 0] \\cup [1, \\infty)$.\nThe interval $[-1, 0]$ defines a compact component (an oval loop). The interval $[1, \\infty)$, along with the point at infinity on the projectivized curve, defines a second, non-compact component.\nTherefore, $E(\\mathbb{R})$ consists of two connected components. The rule for the local root number at infinity states that if $E(\\mathbb{R})$ has one connected component, $w_{\\infty}(E) = +1$, and if it has two connected components, $w_{\\infty}(E) = -1$.\nThus, for the given curve, we have $w_{\\infty}(E) = -1$.\n\n**2. Local Root Number at the Prime $p=2$, $w_{2}(E)$**\n\nTo determine $w_{2}(E)$, we must analyze the reduction of the curve at the prime $p=2$. The equation is of the form $y^{2} = x^{3} + Ax + B$ with $A = -1$ and $B = 0$. The standard invariants are:\n$c_{4} = -48A = -48(-1) = 48 = 2^{4} \\cdot 3$\n$c_{6} = -864B = 0$\n$\\Delta = -16(4A^{3} + 27B^{2}) = -16(4(-1)^{3} + 0) = -16(-4) = 64 = 2^{6}$\n\nThe curve has bad reduction at a prime $p$ if and only if $p$ divides the minimal discriminant $\\Delta_{min}$. Since $\\Delta = 64$, the only possible prime of bad reduction is $p=2$. For all odd primes $p$, the curve has good reduction, and for such primes, the local root number is $w_{p}(E) = +1$.\n\nNow, we analyze the reduction at $p=2$. First, we confirm if the given model is minimal at $p=2$. A model defined by a Weierstrass equation is minimal at $p$ if the valuation $v_p(\\Delta)  12$ or $v_p(c_4)  4$. Here, $v_{2}(\\Delta) = v_{2}(64) = 6$. Since $6  12$, the model is minimal at $p=2$, and the minimal discriminant is $\\Delta_{min} = 64$.\n\nThe reduction type is determined by the valuations of the invariants at $p=2$:\n$v_{2}(\\Delta) = 6  0$\n$v_{2}(c_{4}) = v_{2}(48) = 4  0$\nSince $v_{2}(c_{4})  0$, the reduction at $p=2$ is additive. The specific Kodaira-Néron type is determined from a table based on the valuations of the minimal model's invariants. For a prime $p=2$, the conditions $v_{2}(c_{4}) = 4$, $v_{2}(c_{6})  6$ (here $v_{2}(0)=\\infty$), and $v_{2}(\\Delta) = 6$ uniquely specify the Kodaira type as $I_{0}^{*}$.\n\nThe local root number $w_{2}(E)$ for a curve with additive reduction at $p=2$ depends on the Kodaira type. According to the established rules for local root numbers:\n- For types II, IV, $I_{2m}^{*}$ ($m \\ge 0$), the root number is $-1$.\n- For types III, IV*, $I_{2m+1}^{*}$ ($m \\ge 0$), the root number is $+1$.\nSince our curve has reduction type $I_{0}^{*}$ (which corresponds to the case $m=0$ in the first rule), the local root number at $p=2$ is $w_{2}(E) = -1$.\n\n**3. Global Root Number $w(E)$ and Rank Parity Prediction**\n\nThe global root number is the product of all local root numbers:\n$$w(E) = w_{\\infty}(E) \\cdot w_{2}(E) \\cdot \\prod_{p \\neq 2, \\text{ odd}} w_{p}(E)$$\nWe have determined:\n- $w_{\\infty}(E) = -1$\n- $w_{2}(E) = -1$\n- $w_{p}(E) = +1$ for all odd primes $p$, since the curve has good reduction at these primes.\n\nTherefore, the global root number is:\n$$w(E) = (-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot \\prod_{p \\text{ odd}} 1 = 1$$\n\nThe parity aspect of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture predicts that the sign of the functional equation of the Hasse–Weil L-function of $E$, which is the global root number $w(E)$, is related to the rank $r(E)$ of the Mordell–Weil group $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ by the equation $(-1)^{r(E)} = w(E)$.\nSubstituting our result for $w(E)$:\n$$(-1)^{r(E)} = 1$$\nThis implies that the rank $r(E)$ is predicted to be an even integer.\n\nThe problem asks for the single value of the global root number $w(E)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3089290"}]}
