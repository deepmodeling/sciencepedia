The computation must follow the geometric chord-and-tangent method.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement. The curve is given by $y^{2} = x^{3} - 7$. The point $P = (2,1)$ is asserted to be on this curve. We verify this by substituting the coordinates into the equation: $y_P^2 = 1^2 = 1$ and $x_P^3 - 7 = 2^3 - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1$. Since $1 = 1$, the point $P$ is indeed on the curve $E$. The problem is well-defined, scientifically sound within the domain of number theory, and provides all necessary information. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe calculation of $3P$ is performed in two stages: first, we compute $2P = P+P$, and then we compute $3P = P+2P$.\n\n**Step 1: Computation of $2P$**\n\nTo find $2P$, we first find the tangent line to the curve $E$ at the point $P = (x_P, y_P) = (2,1)$. The slope of the tangent line can be found using implicit differentiation of the curve's equation, $y^2 = x^3 - 7$, with respect to $x$:\n$$\n2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2\n$$\nThe slope, $m = \\frac{dy}{dx}$, is therefore given by:\n$$\nm = \\frac{3x^2}{2y}\n$$\nAt the point $P=(2,1)$, the slope of the tangent line, which we denote as $m_T$, is:\n$$\nm_{T} = \\frac{3(2^2)}{2(1)} = \\frac{3(4)}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n$$\nThe equation of the tangent line at $P$ is given by $y - y_P = m_T(x - x_P)$:\n$$\ny - 1 = 6(x - 2) \\implies y = 6x - 12 + 1 \\implies y = 6x - 11\n$$\nTo find the intersection points of this tangent line with the curve $E$, we substitute this expression for $y$ into the curve's equation:\n$$\n(6x - 11)^2 = x^3 - 7\n$$\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n$$\n36x^2 - 132x + 121 = x^3 - 7\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields a cubic equation in $x$:\n$$\nx^3 - 36x^2 + 132x - 128 = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this cubic equation are the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points. Since the line is tangent to the curve at $P=(2,1)$, the $x$-coordinate $x=2$ must be a double root. Let the three roots be $x_1, x_2, x_3$. We have $x_1 = x_P = 2$ and $x_2 = x_P = 2$. We seek the third root, $x_3$, which we will call $x_R$. According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a monic cubic polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $-a$. In our case, the coefficient of $x^2$ is $-36$. Thus:\n$$\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 = x_P + x_P + x_R = -(-36) = 36\n$$\nSubstituting $x_P=2$:\n$$\n2 + 2 + x_R = 36 \\implies 4 + x_R = 36 \\implies x_R = 32\n$$\nThis value, $x_R = 32$, is the $x$-coordinate of the third point of intersection, $R$. By definition of the group law, the point $2P$ has the same $x$-coordinate as $R$. So, the $x$-coordinate of $2P$ is $x_{2P} = 32$.\n\nTo compute $3P$, we need the full coordinates of $2P$. We find the $y$-coordinate of $R$, denoted $y_R$, by substituting $x_R=32$ into the tangent line equation:\n$$\ny_R = 6(32) - 11 = 192 - 11 = 181\n$$\nSo the third intersection point is $R=(32, 181)$. The point $2P$ is the reflection of $R$ across the $x$-axis, which is given by $(x_R, -y_R)$.\nTherefore, $2P = (32, -181)$. We can verify that this point lies on the curve: $(-181)^2 = 32761$ and $32^3 - 7 = 32768 - 7 = 32761$.\n\n**Step 2: Computation of $3P$**\n\nNow we compute $3P = P + 2P$. We have the points $P = (x_P, y_P) = (2,1)$ and $2P = (x_{2P}, y_{2P}) = (32, -181)$. We find the secant line passing through these two points. The slope of the secant line, $m_S$, is:\n$$\nm_S = \\frac{y_{2P} - y_P}{x_{2P} - x_P} = \\frac{-181 - 1}{32 - 2} = \\frac{-182}{30} = -\\frac{91}{15}\n$$\nThe equation of the secant line is $y - y_P = m_S(x - x_P)$:\n$$\ny - 1 = -\\frac{91}{15}(x - 2)\n$$\nTo find the third point of intersection of this line with the curve $E$, we again substitute the line equation into the curve equation. As before, this results in a cubic equation in $x$. The sum of the $x$-coordinates of the three intersection points, say $x_P, x_{2P}, x_{R'}$, is equal to the square of the slope, $m_S^2$. This is a general property for elliptic curves of the form $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$.\n$$\nx_P + x_{2P} + x_{R'} = m_S^2\n$$\nThe $x$-coordinate of $3P$, denoted $x_{3P}$, is the same as $x_{R'}$. We can solve for $x_{R'}$:\n$$\nx_{3P} = x_{R'} = m_S^2 - x_P - x_{2P}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\nx_{3P} = \\left(-\\frac{91}{15}\\right)^2 - 2 - 32\n$$\n$$\nx_{3P} = \\frac{91^2}{15^2} - 34 = \\frac{8281}{225} - 34\n$$\nTo subtract the whole number, we find a common denominator:\n$$\nx_{3P} = \\frac{8281}{225} - \\frac{34 \\times 225}{225} = \\frac{8281 - 7650}{225} = \\frac{631}{225}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a reduced fraction. The prime factorization of the denominator is $225 = 15^2 = (3 \\times 5)^2 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$. To check if the fraction is reduced, we test if the numerator, $631$, is divisible by $3$ or $5$. The sum of the digits of $631$ is $6+3+1 = 10$, which is not divisible by $3$. The number $631$ does not end in a $0$ or $5$, so it is not divisible by $5$. Therefore, the fraction $\\frac{631}{225}$ is in lowest terms.\n\nThe exact value of the $x$-coordinate of $3P$ is $\\frac{631}{225}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{631}{225}}$$", "id": "3089381"}, {"introduction": "While the geometric chord-and-tangent process provides the intuition for the group law, it is cumbersome for repeated calculations.
