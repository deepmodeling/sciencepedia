It is scientifically grounded in the theory of elliptic curves, a well-established area of number theory. All provided data is self-consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. The elliptic curve $E$ given by $y^{2}=x^{3}-4x+1$ is non-singular, as its discriminant $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)$ for $a=-4$ and $b=1$ is $\\Delta = -16(4(-4)^3 + 27(1)^2) = -16(-256+27) = 3664 \\neq 0$. The given points $P=(0,1)$ and $Q=(2,1)$ are verified to lie on the curve: for $P$, $1^2 = 1$ and $0^3-4(0)+1=1$; for $Q$, $1^2=1$ and $2^3-4(2)+1=8-8+1=1$. The problem is well-posed and objective.\n\nThe task is to derive the formula for the sum of two distinct points on an elliptic curve from first principles and then apply it. The group law on an elliptic curve, known as the chord-and-tangent method, defines the sum of two points $P$ and $Q$. The procedure is as follows:\n$1$. Draw a line $L$ through the points $P$ and $Q$.\n$2$. Due to Bézout's theorem, this line will intersect the cubic curve at a third point, which we shall call $R$. If the points are rational, this third intersection point will also be rational.\n$3$. The sum $P+Q$ is defined as the reflection of the point $R$ across the $x$-axis.\n\nLet us formalize this process algebraically for a general elliptic curve in short Weierstrass form, $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$. Let $P=(x_1, y_1)$ and $Q=(x_2, y_2)$ be two distinct points on the curve, with $x_1 \\neq x_2$.\n\nThe line $L$ passing through $P$ and $Q$ has a slope $m$ given by:\n$$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$\nThe equation of the line $L$ is $y = m(x-x_1) + y_1$.\n\nTo find the intersection points of $L$ and the curve $E$, we substitute the expression for $y$ into the curve's equation:\n$$(m(x-x_1) + y_1)^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$\nExpanding the left-hand side gives a polynomial in $x$. However, a more direct approach is to substitute $y=mx+c$, where $c=y_1-mx_1$, into the general curve equation:\n$$(mx+c)^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$\n$$m^2x^2 + 2mcx + c^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$\nRearranging the terms to form a monic cubic polynomial in $x$:\n$$x^3 - m^2x^2 + (a - 2mc)x + (b - c^2) = 0$$\nThe roots of this cubic equation are the $x$-coordinates of the three intersection points of the line $L$ and the curve $E$. We already know two of these roots: $x_1$ and $x_2$, the $x$-coordinates of $P$ and $Q$. Let the third root be $x_3$, which is the $x$-coordinate of the point $R$.\n\nAccording to Viète's formulas, the sum of the roots of a monic cubic polynomial $x^3+px^2+qx+r=0$ is equal to $-p$. In our case, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is $-m^2$. Therefore:\n$$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -(-m^2) = m^2$$\nFrom this, we can solve for $x_3$:\n$$x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2$$\nThe $y$-coordinate of $R$, denoted $y_R$, is found by using the line equation, since $R$ lies on $L$:\n$$y_R = m x_3 + c = m x_3 + (y_1-mx_1) = m(x_3 - x_1) + y_1$$\nThe sum $P+Q$ is defined as the reflection of $R=(x_3, y_R)$ across the $x$-axis. If $P+Q = (x_S, y_S)$, then:\n$$x_S = x_3$$\n$$y_S = -y_R$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $x_3$ and $y_R$, we obtain the explicit formulas for the sum of two distinct points:\n$$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$\n$$x_S = m^2 - x_1 - x_2$$\n$$y_S = -(m(x_S - x_1) + y_1) = m(x_1 - x_S) - y_1$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nNow, we apply these formulas to the specific problem. The curve is $E: y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1$, and the points are $P=(x_1, y_1)=(0,1)$ and $Q=(x_2, y_2)=(2,1)$.\nFirst, we compute the slope $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{1-1}{2-0} = \\frac{0}{2} = 0$$\nNext, we compute the $x$-coordinate of the sum $P+Q$, which we denote as $(x_3, y_3)$:\n$$x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2 = 0^2 - 0 - 2 = -2$$\nFinally, we compute the $y$-coordinate of the sum:\n$$y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 = 0(0 - (-2)) - 1 = 0(2) - 1 = -1$$\nThus, the sum of the points $P$ and $Q$ is $P+Q = (-2, -1)$.\n\nLastly, we verify that this resulting point lies on the curve $E$. We substitute the coordinates of $(-2, -1)$ into the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1$:\nLeft-hand side: $y^2 = (-1)^2 = 1$.\nRight-hand side: $x^3 - 4x + 1 = (-2)^3 - 4(-2) + 1 = -8 + 8 + 1 = 1$.\nSince the left-hand side equals the right-hand side ($1=1$), the point $(-2, -1)$ is indeed on the elliptic curve $E$.\n\nThis calculation demonstrates the closure property of the group of rational points $E(\\mathbb{Q})$. The sum of two points with rational coordinates yields another point with rational coordinates that also lies on the curve. This closure is a fundamental axiom for a set to form a group. The Mordell-Weil theorem builds upon this group structure to make the much stronger claim that the group $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ is finitely generated.\nThe resulting point is $(-2, -1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-2  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3092358"}, {"introduction": "The proof of the Mordell-Weil theorem relies on a \"height function,\" which measures the arithmetic complexity of a rational point.

The point is $P=(3,5)$, so its $x$-coordinate is $x(P)=3$.\nTo compute the absolute logarithmic height $h(x(P))$, we first write the rational number $x(P)=3$ as a fraction in lowest terms, which is $\\frac{3}{1}$.\nThe naive height $H(x(P))$ is defined as $H(\\frac{a}{b}) = \\max\\{|a|, |b|\\}$.

We use the tangent-and-chord method, specifically the duplication formula for a point on an elliptic curve. The curve $E$ is given by $y^2 = f(x) = x^3 - 2$. For a point $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$, the slope $m$ of the tangent line to the curve at $P_1$ is given by $m = \\frac{f'(x_1)}{2y_1}$.

We analyze parity and prime divisors.\n\nCase A: $x$ is odd. Then $x-2$, $x$, $x+2$ are pairwise coprime odd integers. If their product is a square, each factor must itself be a square. Hence we would have $x = u^2$, $x-2 = v^2$, $x+2 = w^2$ for some integers $u,v,w$. But then $u^2 - v^2 = 2$ implies $(u-v)(u+v) = 2$, which has no integer solutions with $u,v$ both integers except the trivial incompatible cases. Therefore, no solutions with $x$ odd and $y \\neq 0$ exist.\n\nCase B: $x$ is even. Write $x = 2t$ with $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Then\n$$\ny^2 = x(x-2)(x+2) = 8\\,t(t-1)(t+1).\n$$\nThe three consecutive integers $t-1$, $t$, $t+1$ are pairwise coprime except possibly for the prime $2$. For any odd prime $p$, exactly one of $t-1$, $t$, $t+1$ is divisible by $p$; since $y^2$ is a square, the $p$-adic valuation in the product $t(t-1)(t+1)$ must be even, forcing the exponent of $p$ in whichever of $t-1$, $t$, $t+1$ is divisible by $p$ to be even. Consequently, each of $t-1$, $t$, $t+1$ has only odd prime factors to even exponents, i.e., each is of the form $2^{\\alpha}\\cdot(\\text{square})$.\n\nIf $t$ is even, then $t-1$ and $t+1$ are consecutive odd integers; both being perfect squares is impossible because consecutive odd squares differ by at least $4$, whereas $(t+1)-(t-1)=2$.\n\nIf $t$ is odd, set $t = u^2$ (odd square). Then $t-1$ and $t+1$ are consecutive even integers, so we may write $t-1 = 2^{\\alpha} a^2$ and $t+1 = 2^{\\beta} b^2$ with integers $a,b$ and $\\alpha,\\beta \\geq 1$. Subtract:\n$$\n2 = (t+1) - (t-1) = 2^{\\beta} b^2 - 2^{\\alpha} a^2.\n$$\nWithout loss of generality, assume $\\alpha \\leq \\beta$. Dividing by $2^{\\alpha}$ yields\n$$\n2^{1 - \\alpha} = 2^{\\beta - \\alpha} b^2 - a^2.\n$$\nIf $\\alpha \\geq 2$, the left-hand side is a fraction, which is impossible. Hence $\\alpha \\in \\{0,1\\}$, but $\\alpha \\geq 1$ because $t-1$ is even, so $\\alpha = 1$, giving\n$$\n1 = 2^{\\beta - 1} b^2 - a^2.\n$$\nIf $\\beta \\geq 2$, then the right-hand side is congruent to $-a^2 \\pmod{4}$, which cannot equal $1$; thus $\\beta = 1$, and we obtain $1 = 2b^2 - a^2$. Rearranging gives $a^2 - 2b^2 = -1$, the classical Pell-type equation. However, substituting back into $t-1 = 2a^2$ and $t+1 = 2b^2$ and subtracting yields\n$$\n(t+1) - (t-1) = 2b^2 - 2a^2 = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b^2 - a^2 = 1,\n$$\nso $(b-a)(b+a)=1$, which forces $a=0$, $b=\\pm 1$. Then $t-1 = 0$ gives $t=1$ (and similarly $t=-1$), leading precisely to the solutions with $y=0$ found earlier. Therefore, there are no solutions with $y \\neq 0$ when $x$ is even.\n\nCombining Cases A and B, the only integral points on $E$ are $(x,y) = (-2,0),(0,0),(2,0)$ (and $\\mathcal{O}$, the point at infinity). By the Nagell-Lutz theorem, these are torsion points with $y=0$, hence each has order $2$. There are no integral points with $y \\neq 0$, so there are no non-torsion integral points.\n\nThus the complete set of integral affine points on $E$ is $\\{(-2,0),(0,0),(2,0)\\}$, all of which are torsion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}(-2, 0)  (0, 0)  (2, 0)\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3092292"}]}
