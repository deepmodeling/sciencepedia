An engineer wishes to place a tiny Light Emitting Diode (LED) at a specific point $P$ on this surface.

The surface is then the level set $F(x, y, z) = 0$.\n\nThe normal vector to a level surface $F(x, y, z) = c$ at any point $(x, y, z)$ is given by the gradient of the function $F$, which is denoted by $\\nabla F$. We calculate the gradient of our function $F$:\n$$\n\\nabla F(x, y, z) = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = -1\n$$\nSo, the normal vector at any point $(x, y, z)$ on the surface is $\\vec{n} = \\nabla F = \\langle y, x, -1 \\rangle$.\n\nNext, we identify the direction vector of the given line. The line is described by the vector equation $\\vec{r}(t) = \\langle 2t + 1, 3t + 1, 1 - t \\rangle$.
