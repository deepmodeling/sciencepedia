A circular cylinder is a developable surface.\n\nFirst, we parameterize the cylinder. A standard parameterization for a cylinder of radius $R=1$ is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{r}(u, v) = (\\cos(u), \\sin(u), v) $$\nHere, $u$ corresponds to the angle of rotation around the $z$-axis and $v$ corresponds to the height along the $z$-axis. The surface can be \"unrolled\" into a 2D plane with Cartesian coordinates $(u, v)$. A geodesic path on the cylinder corresponds to a straight line in this $(u, v)$-plane.\n\nThe equation of a straight line in the $(u,v)$-plane starting at $(u_0, v_0)$ with a constant velocity $(\\dot{u}_0, \\dot{v}_0)$ is given by:\n$$ u(t) = u_0 + \\dot{u}_0 t $$\n$$ v(t) = v_0 + \\dot{v}_0 t $$\nWe need to determine the initial conditions $u_0, v_0, \\dot{u}_0, \\dot{v}_0$ from the given information in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nThe initial position is $P_0 = (1, 0, 5)$. We map this to our parameterization $\\mathbf{r}(u_0, v_0) = (\\cos(u_0), \\sin(u_0), v_0)$.\n$$ (\\cos(u_0), \\sin(u_0), v_0) = (1, 0, 5) $$\nFrom this, we can see that $\\cos(u_0)=1$ and $\\sin(u_0)=0$, which implies $u_0 = 0$ (we can choose any integer multiple of $2\\pi$, but $0$ is the simplest). The $z$-coordinate directly gives $v_0 = 5$. So, the initial position in the $(u,v)$-plane is $(u_0, v_0) = (0, 5)$.\n\nNext, we find the initial velocity in the $(u,v)$ coordinates. The path of the particle in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}(t) = \\mathbf{r}(u(t), v(t))$. The velocity vector is the time derivative of the path, which we find using the chain rule:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}(t) = \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\mathbf{r}(u(t), v(t)) = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial u} \\frac{du}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial v} \\frac{dv}{dt} $$\nThe partial derivatives of $\\mathbf{r}(u, v)$ are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial u} = (-\\sin(u), \\cos(u), 0) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial v} = (0, 0, 1) $$\nAt $t=0$, we have $u(0) = u_0 = 0$. So we evaluate the partial derivatives at $u=0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial u}\\bigg|_{t=0} = (-\\sin(0), \\cos(0), 0) = (0, 1, 0) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial v}\\bigg|_{t=0} = (0, 0, 1) $$\nThe initial velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}_0$ is therefore:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_0 = \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}'(0) = (0, 1, 0) \\frac{du}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} + (0, 0, 1) \\frac{dv}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = (0, \\dot{u}_0, \\dot{v}_0) $$\nWe are given that $\\mathbf{v}_0 = (0, 1, 1)$. By comparing the components, we find:\n$$ \\dot{u}_0 = 1 $$\n$$ \\dot{v}_0 = 1 $$\n\nNow we have all the parameters for our straight line in the $(u, v)$-plane:\n$$ u(t) = 0 + 1 \\cdot t = t $$\n$$ v(t) = 5 + 1 \\cdot t = 5 + t $$\n\nFinally, to find the geodesic path $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}(t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we substitute these functions $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ back into our cylinder parameterization $\\mathbf{r}(u,v)$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}(t) = (\\cos(u(t)), \\sin(u(t)), v(t)) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ gives:\n$$ x(t) = \\cos(t) $$\n$$ y(t) = \\sin(t) $$\n$$ z(t) = 5 + t $$\nThe resulting path is a helix winding around the cylinder.
