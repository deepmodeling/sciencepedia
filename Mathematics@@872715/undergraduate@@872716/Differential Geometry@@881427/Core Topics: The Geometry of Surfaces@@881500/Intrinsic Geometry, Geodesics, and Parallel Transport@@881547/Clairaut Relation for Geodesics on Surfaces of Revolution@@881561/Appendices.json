This quantity is described by Clairaut's relation.\n\nFirst, let's identify the surface and its properties. The surface is generated by revolving the curve $z=1/r$ about the $z$-axis. We can parameterize this surface using cylindrical-like coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the $z$-axis and $\\theta$ is the azimuthal angle.

The curves of constant $\\theta$ are the meridians, and the curves of constant $r$ are the parallels. The radius of a parallel at a given $r$ is simply $r$.\n\nClairaut's theorem provides a conservation law for geodesics on surfaces of revolution. The theorem states that for any geodesic, the quantity $C$ defined as:\n$$\nC = \\rho \\sin\\psi\n$$\nis constant along the entire length of the geodesic. Here, $\\rho$ is the distance from a point on the geodesic to the axis of revolution, and $\\psi$ is the angle that the geodesic makes with the meridian passing through that point.\n\nIn our parameterization, the distance from a point on the surface to the axis of revolution is the radial coordinate $r$. So, the Clairaut constant $C$ is given by:\n$$\nC = r \\sin\\psi\n$$\nwhere $\\psi$ is the angle between the geodesic and the meridian. The problem statement explicitly asks for this value.\n\nWe are given the specific conditions at one point on the geodesic:\n1. The geodesic intersects the parallel circle where the radial distance is $r = 2$.\n2. At this point, the angle $\\psi$ between the geodesic and the local meridian is $45$ degrees.\n\nWe can now substitute these values into the formula for the Clairaut constant:\n$$\nC = (2) \\sin(45^{\\circ})\n$$\nThe value of $\\sin(45^{\\circ})$ is a standard trigonometric value:\n$$\n\\sin(45^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $C$:\n$$\nC = 2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nC = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nSince this quantity is conserved along the geodesic, its value is $\\sqrt{2}$ everywhere on this particular path.
