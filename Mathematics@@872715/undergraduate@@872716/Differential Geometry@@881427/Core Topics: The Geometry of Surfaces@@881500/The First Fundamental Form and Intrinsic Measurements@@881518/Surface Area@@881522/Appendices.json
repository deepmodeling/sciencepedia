The cross-sectional shape of the dish is described by the equation $y = \\alpha x^2$, where $y$ is the depth of the dish from its horizontal rim and $x$ is the radial distance from the central axis. The dish is constructed with a total diameter of $D$. The interior surface of the dish is to be coated with a highly reflective material. To accurately budget for the material cost, an exact calculation of the surface area is required.\n\nDetermine the total surface area, $A$, of the dish's interior parabolic surface. Express your answer as a symbolic, closed-form expression in terms of the given parameters $\\alpha$ and $D$.", "solution": "The surface in question is a surface of revolution generated by rotating a curve about the y-axis. The curve is a parabola defined by the function $y = f(x) = \\alpha x^2$. The rotation is about the central axis, which corresponds to the y-axis in this coordinate system. The problem states that the total diameter of the dish is $D$. Since $x$ represents the radial distance from the central axis, the radius of the dish's rim is $R = D/2$. The curve is thus rotated over the interval of $x$ from $0$ to $D/2$.\n\nThe formula for the area of a surface of revolution generated by rotating a curve $y=f(x)$ for $a \\le x \\le b$ around the y-axis is given by $A = \\int_{a}^{b} 2\\pi x \\sqrt{1 + [f'(x)]^2} \\,dx$.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of the function $f(x) = \\alpha x^2$. The derivative is $f'(x) = 2\\alpha x$.\n\nNext, we set up the definite integral for the surface area, using the integration bounds $a=0$ and $b=D/2$:\n$$ A = \\int_{0}^{D/2} 2\\pi x \\sqrt{1 + (2\\alpha x)^2} \\,dx = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{D/2} x \\sqrt{1 + 4\\alpha^2 x^2} \\,dx $$\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we employ the method of substitution.
