This practice challenges you to apply the Euler-Poincaré formula, $\\chi = V - E + F$, which relates the number of vertices ($V$), edges ($E$), and faces ($F$) of a network drawn on a surface. By calculating this value from a given network, you can directly determine the surface's genus, a key topological invariant, using the relation $\\chi = 2 - 2g$ for orientable surfaces [@problem_id:1675578].", "problem": "A team of topological engineers is designing a complex, interconnected data routing system on the surface of a sealed, self-contained hardware module. The surface of this module is known to be a closed, orientable manifold. The design consists of a network layout with specific features: there are exactly 20 connection nodes, which are treated as vertices. These nodes are linked by 30 distinct, non-intersecting data pathways, which are treated as edges. This network of nodes and pathways divides the entire surface of the module into 6 separate, contiguous regions, which are treated as faces. Based on this topological configuration, calculate the genus of the module's surface.", "solution": "The problem asks for the genus of a closed, orientable surface based on the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a graph embedded on it.\n\nThe fundamental relationship connecting these quantities is the Euler-Poincaré formula for a polyhedral complex on a surface $S$. The formula states that the Euler characteristic, $\\chi(S)$, of the surface is given by:\n$$\n\\chi(S) = V - E + F\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges, and $F$ is the number of faces of the cellular decomposition of the surface.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following values:\n- The number of vertices, $V = 20$.\n- The number of edges, $E = 30$.\n- The number of faces, $F = 6$.\n\nWe can substitute these values into the Euler-Poincaré formula to calculate the Euler characteristic of the module's surface:\n$$\n\\chi(S) = 20 - 30 + 6\n$$\n$$\n\\chi(S) = -10 + 6\n$$\n$$\n\\chi(S) = -4\n$$\nNow, for any closed, orientable surface, the Euler characteristic is related to its genus, $g$, by the following formula:\n$$\n\\chi(S) = 2 - 2g\n$$\nThe genus $g$ is an integer representing the number of \"handles\" on the surface (e.g., a sphere has $g=0$, a torus has $g=1$, a double-torus has $g=2$, and so on).\n\nWe have already calculated the Euler characteristic to be $-4$. We can now set the two expressions for $\\chi(S)$ equal to each other to solve for the genus $g$:\n$$\n2 - 2g = -4\n$$\nTo solve for $g$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\n-2g = -4 - 2\n$$\n$$\n-2g = -6\n$$\nDividing both sides by $-2$, we find the genus:\n$$\ng = \\frac{-6}{-2}\n$$\n$$\ng = 3\n$$\nThus, the genus of the module's surface is 3.

This exercise guides you through the process of creating a compact surface by gluing together the edges of a polygon according to a specific set of instructions. Your task is to track how the vertices and edges of the polygon merge to form the final topological space, allowing you to compute its Euler characteristic and, consequently, its genus [@problem_id:1675565].

A compact, two-dimensional topological surface is constructed by identifying pairs of edges on the boundary of this decagon. The sequence of identifications, as one traverses the boundary in a counter-clockwise direction, is given by the word $abcdea^{-1}b^{-1}c^{-1}d^{-1}e^{-1}$.
