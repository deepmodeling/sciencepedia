The construction is achieved by taking the rectangle, giving one of its ends a single half-twist (a rotation of $180$ degrees), and then gluing that end to the other end, matching them edge to edge.\n\nImagine this Möbius strip is then carefully cut along its entire central circle, which is the line that runs exactly halfway between the strip's single continuous edge.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the object or objects that result from this procedure?\n\nA.

Two identical, separate (unlinked) Möbius strips, each having a length of $L$ and a width of $w/2$.", "solution": "A standard Möbius strip can be modeled as the quotient of the rectangle \n$$\nR=\\{(x,y)\\mid 0\\leq x\\leq L,\\,-\\tfrac{w}{2}\\leq y\\leq \\tfrac{w}{2}\\}\n$$\nunder the identification\n$$\n(0,y)\\sim (L,-y),\n$$\nwhich introduces a single half-twist. The central circle of the Möbius strip corresponds to the line $y=0$ under this identification.\n\nCutting along the central circle is modeled by removing the line $y=0$ from the rectangle, producing two open sub-rectangles:\n$$\nR_{+}=\\{(x,y)\\mid 0\\leq x\\leq L,\\,0<y\\leq \\tfrac{w}{2}\\},\\quad R_{-}=\\{(x,y)\\mid 0\\leq x\\leq L,\\,-\\tfrac{w}{2}\\leq y<0\\}.\n$$\nUnder the original identification $(0,y)\\sim(L,-y)$, the right edge of $R_{+}$ at $x=L$ is identified with the left edge of $R_{-}$ at $x=0$ (via $y\\mapsto -y$), and the right edge of $R_{-}$ at $x=L$ is identified with the left edge of $R_{+}$ at $x=0$ (again via $y\\mapsto -y$). Therefore, $R_{+}$ and $R_{-}$ concatenate end-to-end to form a single strip whose:\n- length is $2L$ (traversing first $R_{+}$ from $x=0$ to $x=L$ and then $R_{-}$ from $x=0$ to $x=L$), and\n- width is $w/2$ (the width of each of $R_{+}$ or $R_{-}$).\n\nTo determine orientability and the twist count of the resulting strip, consider the end-to-end identification over one full traversal of the new strip. Over the first segment of length $L$ (through $R_{+}$), the transverse coordinate $y$ is transported to $-y$ at the junction (reflection $y\\mapsto -y$). Over the second segment of length $L$ (through $R_{-}$), the same reflection occurs at the next junction. Hence, over the entire length $2L$, the effective transverse identification is the composition of two reflections,\n$$\ny \\xmapsto{\\;R\\;} -y \\xmapsto{\\;R\\;} y,\n$$\nwhich is the identity on the transverse coordinate. This implies that the resulting band is orientable (two-sided), i.e., topologically an annulus (a cylinder).\n\nTo compute the geometric twist (the total rotation of a transverse marker during one loop of the resulting band), use a standard embedded model of a Möbius strip with parameters $(s,v)$, where $s\\in[0,2\\pi]$ parametrizes the central circle and $v\\in[-w/2,w/2]$ is the transverse coordinate. In such a model, along the central circle $v=0$, the local transverse direction rotates by an angle that changes as $s/2$; hence going once around the Möbius central circle changes the transverse direction by $\\pi$. After cutting along $v=0$, the resulting single band is traversed by first following the $v>0$ side once around (which contributes a change of $+\\pi$), then switching to the $v<0$ side (which flips the transverse direction, contributing an additional jump of $+\\pi$), then traversing once around on the $v<0$ side (another $+\\pi$), and finally switching back to the $v>0$ side to close the loop (a final $+\\pi$). The total change in transverse angle over one circuit of the resulting band is therefore\n$$\n\\pi+\\pi+\\pi+\\pi=4\\pi,\n$$\ni.e., two full twists (a total rotation of $720^{\\circ}$). This matches an orientable strip with two full twists, length $2L$, and width $w/2$.\n\nThus, the correct description is a single, orientable strip with two full twists, having length $2L$ and width $w/2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1654556"}, {"introduction": "Having built some physical intuition, we now turn to a more formal tool for characterizing surfaces: the Euler characteristic. This powerful topological invariant helps us classify and distinguish different types of surfaces. In this practice [@problem_id:1654534], we will construct the Klein bottle, another canonical non-orientable surface, by identifying the edges of a square and then compute its Euler characteristic, $\\chi = V - E + F$. This exercise demonstrates how a simple combinatorial formula can uncover deep structural properties of a complex geometric object.", "problem": "A topological space known as the Klein bottle can be constructed from a unit square, represented by the set of points $(x,y)$ where $0 \\le x \\le 1$ and $0 \\le y \\le 1$. The construction involves identifying points on the boundary of the square according to two specific rules:\n1.  Identification of the vertical edges: For any $y$ in $[0,1]$, the point $(0, y)$ is identified with the point $(1, y)$.\n2.  Identification of the horizontal edges with a twist: For any $x$ in $[0,1]$, the point $(x, 0)$ is identified with the point $(1-x, 1)$.\n\nThis process of \"gluing\" the edges together transforms the square into a 2-dimensional cell complex. This complex consists of a single 2-cell (the interior of the square), the 1-cells formed by the identified edges, and the 0-cells formed by the identified corners. Your task is to determine the Euler characteristic of the resulting Klein bottle.", "solution": "The Euler characteristic, $\\chi$, for a cell complex is given by the formula $\\chi = V - E + F$, where $V$ is the number of vertices (0-cells), $E$ is the number of edges (1-cells), and $F$ is the number of faces (2-cells) after all identifications have been made.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of faces, $F$. The interior of the initial square is a single 2-cell. The identification rules only apply to the boundary of the square, so the interior is not identified with any other region. Therefore, the resulting space has exactly one face.\n$F = 1$.\n\nNext, we determine the number of edges, $E$. The original square has four edges:\n- The left edge: $e_1 = \\{(0, y) | 0 \\le y \\le 1\\}$\n- The right edge: $e_2 = \\{(1, y) | 0 \\le y \\le 1\\}$\n- The bottom edge: $e_3 = \\{(x, 0) | 0 \\le x \\le 1\\}$\n- The top edge: $e_4 = \\{(x, 1) | 0 \\le x \\le 1\\}$\nThe first identification rule, $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$, states that the left edge $e_1$ is identified with the right edge $e_2$. Thus, after identification, these two edges become a single edge in the Klein bottle. Let's call this edge $a$.\nThe second identification rule, $(x, 0) \\sim (1-x, 1)$, states that the bottom edge $e_3$ is identified with the top edge $e_4$. Thus, these two edges also become a single edge in the resulting space. Let's call this edge $b$.\nTherefore, the Klein bottle has two distinct edges.\n$E = 2$.\n\nFinally, we determine the number of vertices, $V$. The original square has four vertices (corners):\n- $v_1 = (0, 0)$\n- $v_2 = (1, 0)$\n- $v_3 = (1, 1)$\n- $v_4 = (0, 1)$\nWe need to track how these vertices are identified with each other by the given rules.\n\nLet's use the first rule, $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$, at its endpoints:\n- For $y=0$: The point $(0, 0)$ is identified with $(1, 0)$. So, $v_1 \\sim v_2$.\n- For $y=1$: The point $(0, 1)$ is identified with $(1, 1)$. So, $v_4 \\sim v_3$.\nFrom this rule, we know that the four vertices collapse into at most two distinct sets: $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ and $\\{v_3, v_4\\}$.\n\nNow let's use the second rule, $(x, 0) \\sim (1-x, 1)$, at its endpoints:\n- For $x=0$: The point $(0, 0)$ is identified with $(1-0, 1) = (1, 1)$. So, $v_1 \\sim v_3$.\n- For $x=1$: The point $(1, 0)$ is identified with $(1-1, 1) = (0, 1)$. So, $v_2 \\sim v_4$.\n\nLet's combine these findings. We have the following chain of identifications:\n$v_1 \\sim v_2$ (from the first rule)\n$v_1 \\sim v_3$ (from the second rule)\nCombining these gives $v_1 \\sim v_2 \\sim v_3$.\nWe also know that $v_4 \\sim v_3$. Therefore, $v_1 \\sim v_2 \\sim v_3 \\sim v_4$.\nAll four corners of the square are identified to a single point in the Klein bottle.\nThus, the number of vertices is 1.\n$V = 1$.\n\nNow we can compute the Euler characteristic using the formula $\\chi = V - E + F$:\n$\\chi = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1654534"}, {"introduction": "We now connect the topological idea of a 'twist' to the rigorous framework of differential geometry through the concept of holonomy.
