The total number of vertices in our graph is $N=5$.\n\nA key property of any triangulation of a polygon is the number of triangles it contains. For a polygon with $n$ boundary vertices and $k$ interior vertices, the triangulation will consist of $F = n + 2k - 2$ triangles. In our case, $n=4$ and $k=1$, so the number of triangles in any valid triangulation must be $F = 4 + 2(1) - 2 = 4$.\n\nWe need to partition the square into 4 triangles using the 5 given vertices. We can analyze the possible structures by considering the connectivity of the interior point $P$.\n\n**Case 1: The interior vertex $P$ is connected to all four corner vertices.**\nIn this scenario, we draw four internal edges from $P$ to each of the corner vertices: $PV_1, PV_2, PV_3, PV_4$. These four edges, together with the four boundary edges of the square, partition the square into four triangles: $\\triangle V_1PV_2$, $\\triangle V_2PV_3$, $\\triangle V_3PV_4$, and $\\triangle V_4PV_1$. This is a valid triangulation.\n\nLet's compute the multiset of vertex degrees for this triangulation.\n- The degree of the interior vertex $P$ is 4, as it is connected to all four corners ($\\deg(P) = 4$).\n- The degree of any corner vertex, say $V_1$, is 3. It is connected to its two neighbors on the boundary ($V_2$ and $V_4$) and to the interior point $P$ ($\\deg(V_1)=3$). By symmetry, all corner vertices have a degree of 3.\n- The multiset of degrees for this triangulation is $\\{4, 3, 3, 3, 3\\}$.\n\n**Case 2: The interior vertex $P$ is connected to fewer than four corner vertices.**\nFor a valid triangulation, the interior vertex $P$ must be connected to at least three other vertices to avoid forming a polygon around $P$ that cannot be triangulated without additional vertices. Let's assume $P$ is connected to exactly three corner vertices.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let $P$ be connected to $V_1, V_2$, and $V_3$. The edges $PV_1, PV_2, PV_3$ form two triangles, $\\triangle V_1PV_2$ and $\\triangle V_2PV_3$. The remaining uncovered area is the quadrilateral $V_1PV_3V_4$. To complete the triangulation of the square, we must partition this quadrilateral into two triangles. The only way to do this with a single edge is to add one of its diagonals. The diagonal $PV_4$ would result in Case 1, so we must add the diagonal $V_1V_3$.\n\nThis gives a second valid triangulation consisting of four triangles: $\\triangle V_1PV_2$, $\\triangle V_2PV_3$, $\\triangle V_1PV_3$, and $\\triangle V_1V_3V_4$.\n\nLet's compute the multiset of vertex degrees for this second triangulation.\n- The degree of the interior vertex $P$ is 3, as it is connected to $V_1, V_2, V_3$ ($\\deg(P) = 3$).\n- $\\deg(V_1)$: connected to $V_2$ (boundary), $V_4$ (boundary), $P$ (internal), and $V_3$ (internal). So, $\\deg(V_1) = 4$.\n- $\\deg(V_2)$: connected to $V_1$ (boundary), $V_3$ (boundary), and $P$ (internal). So, $\\deg(V_2) = 3$.\n- $\\deg(V_3)$: connected to $V_2$ (boundary), $V_4$ (boundary), $P$ (internal), and $V_1$ (internal). So, $\\deg(V_3) = 4$.\n- $\\deg(V_4)$: connected only to its neighbors on the boundary, $V_1$ and $V_3$. So, $\\deg(V_4) = 2$.\n- The multiset of degrees for this triangulation is $\\{3, 4, 3, 4, 2\\}$, which we can order as $\\{2, 3, 3, 4, 4\\}$.\n\nNote that if we had chosen a different set of three corners to connect to $P$ (e.g., $V_2, V_3, V_4$), this would correspond to a rotation or reflection of the square. The resulting degree multiset would be identical, so it would not be a new combinatorially distinct triangulation.\n\n**Comparison and Conclusion**\nWe have found two possible structures for the triangulation:\n- Triangulation 1 has a degree multiset of $\\{3, 3, 3, 3, 4\\}$.\n- Triangulation 2 has a degree multiset of $\\{2, 3, 3, 4, 4\\}$.\n\nSince these multisets of degrees are different, the two triangulations are, by the problem's definition, combinatorially distinct. These two cases are exhaustive. Any triangulation must have the interior vertex $P$ lie inside some triangle of a base triangulation of the square (which must use a diagonal). This method systematically generates Case 2. The only other possibility is that $P$ is not contained in any such subdividing triangle, but is instead the central vertex for all new triangles, which is Case 1.
