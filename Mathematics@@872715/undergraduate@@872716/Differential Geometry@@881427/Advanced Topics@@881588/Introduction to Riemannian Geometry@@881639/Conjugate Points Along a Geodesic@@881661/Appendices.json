The Jacobi field must satisfy the Jacobi equation and a given set of initial conditions.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the Jacobi equation in the context of Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The standard metric on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is flat, which means its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. That is, $R(X, Y)Z = 0$ for any vector fields $X, Y, Z$.
