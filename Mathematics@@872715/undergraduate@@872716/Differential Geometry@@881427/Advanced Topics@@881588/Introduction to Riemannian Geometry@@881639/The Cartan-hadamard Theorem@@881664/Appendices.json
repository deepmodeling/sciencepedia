The theorem requires three conditions to hold for a connected Riemannian manifold $M$:\n1. $M$ is complete.\n2. $M$ has non-positive sectional curvature.\n3. $M$ is simply connected.\n\nLet's examine each of these conditions for the given manifold $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the sectional curvature. The problem states that $M$ is equipped with the standard flat product metric. A \"flat\" Riemannian manifold is one where the Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. Consequently, the sectional curvature $K$, which is derived from the curvature tensor, is also identically zero for all 2-dimensional subspaces of any tangent space. Since $K=0$, the condition of non-positive sectional curvature ($K \\le 0$) is satisfied everywhere. This eliminates option B, which incorrectly claims the existence of positive curvature.\n\nSecond, we consider completeness. The problem statement asserts that the manifold is complete. To verify this, we can think about geodesics on the cylinder. The universal cover of the cylinder $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and the covering map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is a local isometry. Geodesics in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are straight lines, which can be extended indefinitely in both directions. The geodesics on the cylinder are the projections of these straight lines. Since the geodesics in the covering space are complete, the geodesics on the cylinder are also complete. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, a manifold on which all geodesics can be extended for all values of their parameter is a complete metric space. Therefore, $M$ is complete. This eliminates option A. The completeness of $M$ also implies, by the Hopf-Rinow theorem, that the exponential map $\\exp_p: T_pM \\to M$ is defined on the entire tangent space for any $p \\in M$, which eliminates option E.\n\nThird, we examine the simple-connectedness of $M$. A space is simply connected if it is path-connected and its fundamental group is trivial. The manifold $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is clearly path-connected. To find its fundamental group, we use the property that the fundamental group of a product of spaces is the product of their individual fundamental groups: $\\pi_1(A \\times B) \\cong \\pi_1(A) \\times \\pi_1(B)$.\nIn our case, $A = S^1$ (the circle) and $B = \\mathbb{R}$ (the real line).\nThe fundamental group of the circle is the group of integers, $\\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This is because of the existence of non-contractible loops that wind around the circle.\nThe real line $\\mathbb{R}$ is a contractible space, so its fundamental group is the trivial group, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\{0\\}$.\nTherefore, the fundamental group of the cylinder is $\\pi_1(M) = \\pi_1(S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{0\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSince the fundamental group $\\mathbb{Z}$ is not the trivial group, the manifold $M$ is not simply connected. This is the hypothesis of the Cartan-Hadamard theorem that fails. This makes option C the correct answer.\n\nFinally, option D is incorrect because the problem statement explicitly defines $M$ as a Riemannian manifold by equipping it with a metric.\n\nIn summary, the cylinder $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is a complete, connected Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature, but it is not simply connected.
