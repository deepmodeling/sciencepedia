Let's write this property as a mathematical equation. We fix the first index to be $a=1$. The last three indices are $b, c, d$. A cyclic permutation of $(b, c, d)$ results in the sequence of tuples $(b,c,d)$, $(c,d,b)$, and $(d,b,c)$.\n\nThe identity can therefore be written as:\n$$R_{abcd} + R_{acdb} + R_{adbc} = 0$$\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to apply this identity to the specific indices given.

This final exercise [@problem_id:1668130] offers a beautiful insight into the origin of this identity by deriving it in the context of a hypersurface embedded in Euclidean space. By leveraging the celebrated Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi equations, you will see how this crucial differential property emerges from the interplay between the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the surface.", "problem": "Consider an $n$-dimensional smooth hypersurface $M$ isometrically embedded in an $(n+1)$-dimensional Euclidean space, $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let local coordinates on the hypersurface be denoted by $\\{u^i\\}$, for $i=1, \\dots, n$.\n\nThe geometry of the hypersurface is described by two fundamental quadratic forms. The first fundamental form, or induced metric tensor, is given by $g_{ij}$. The second fundamental form is denoted by $L_{ij}$. The intrinsic geometry of $M$ is captured by its Riemann curvature tensor, $R_{hijk}$, which is determined by the metric $g_{ij}$.

This is the expression for the second Bianchi identity. For any Riemann tensor derived from a metric via the Levi-Civita connection, this identity holds automatically, and the sum is identically zero. The question is essentially asking to verify that the Riemann tensor for an embedded hypersurface, as given by the Gauss equation, satisfies this identity, provided the second fundamental form satisfies the Codazzi-Mainardi equation.\n\nLet's demonstrate this. We take the covariant derivative of the Gauss equation:\n$$R_{hijk;l} = (L_{hi}L_{jk} - L_{hj}L_{ik})_{;l}$$\nUsing the product rule, this becomes:\n$$R_{hijk;l} = (L_{hi;l}L_{jk} - L_{hj;l}L_{ik}) + (L_{hi}L_{jk;l} - L_{hj}L_{ik;l})$$\n\nWe then sum this expression cyclically over the indices $(j, k, l)$:\n$$S = \\sum_{\\text{cyc}(j,k,l)} (L_{hi;l}L_{jk} - L_{hj;l}L_{ik}) + \\sum_{\\text{cyc}(j,k,l)} (L_{hi}L_{jk;l} - L_{hj}L_{ik;l})$$\n\nThe Codazzi-Mainardi equation, $L_{ab;c} = L_{ac;b}$, states that we can swap the derivative index with the second index of the second fundamental form. This key property allows us to show that the terms in the full sum for $S$ cancel out.\n\nA full expansion and regrouping of all 12 terms in the expression for $S$ using the Codazzi equation for each derivative term reveals that all terms cancel out. For instance, the term $L_{hi}L_{jk;l}$ from the expansion of $R_{hijk;l}$ can be transformed using Codazzi to $L_{hi}L_{jl;k}$. A careful, albeit lengthy, calculation shows that every term is cancelled by another term in the sum.\n\nTherefore, the Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi equations together ensure the geometric consistency of the embedding, which includes satisfying the second Bianchi identity for the intrinsic curvature. The result is:\n$$ S = R_{hijk;l} + R_{hilj;k} + R_{hikl;j} = 0 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1668130"}]}
