We will check each of the three properties by direct substitution and algebraic manipulation.\n\n**Checking Property (I): Antisymmetry in the first two indices**\nThis property requires that $T_{abcd} = -T_{bacd}$. We start by constructing $T_{bacd}$ by swapping the indices $a$ and $b$ in the definition of $T_{abcd}$:\n$$T_{bacd} = g_{bc}g_{ad} - g_{bd}g_{ac}$$\nNow, we can factor out a negative sign from this expression:\n$$T_{bacd} = -(g_{bd}g_{ac} - g_{bc}g_{ad})$$\nRecognizing that the terms inside the parentheses are just reordered, we can write:\n$$T_{bacd} = -(g_{ac}g_{bd} - g_{ad}g_{bc})$$\nThe expression in the parentheses is the definition of $T_{abcd}$.
