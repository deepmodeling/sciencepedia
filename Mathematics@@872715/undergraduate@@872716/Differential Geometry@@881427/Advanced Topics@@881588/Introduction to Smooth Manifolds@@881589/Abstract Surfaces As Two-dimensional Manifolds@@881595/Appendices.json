A parameterization, also known as a chart, is a smooth, invertible map $\\phi: U \\to V$, where $U$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^k$ and $V$ is an open subset of the manifold $M$.\n\nConsider the 3-dimensional manifold, which we will call $M$, embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^4$. This manifold is defined as the set of all points $(x,y,z,w)$ that satisfy the equation:\n$$ x^2 + y^2 - zw = 1 $$\n\nYour task is to identify a suitable parameterization for a portion of this manifold.

The manifold is defined by a single non-degenerate equation within the 4-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^4$. Therefore, it is a hypersurface with dimension $k = 4 - 1 = 3$. This means a valid chart must be a map from an open set $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3$ to an open set $V \\subseteq M$. The coordinates of the domain $U$ are given as $(u, v, t)$.\n\nThe problem specifies that we are interested in the part of the manifold where $z \\neq 0$. This condition is key. It allows us to use the implicit function theorem, which guarantees that one variable can be expressed as a function of the others. In this case, since $z \\neq 0$, we can rearrange the defining equation $x^2 + y^2 - zw = 1$ to solve for $w$.\n\nStarting with the manifold's equation:\n$$ x^2 + y^2 - zw = 1 $$\nWe isolate the term with $w$:\n$$ zw = x^2 + y^2 - 1 $$\nSince we are in a region where $z \\neq 0$, we can divide by $z$ to express $w$ as a function of $x, y,$ and $z$:\n$$ w = \\frac{x^2 + y^2 - 1}{z} $$\nThis expression shows that for any choice of $(x, y, z)$ where $z \\neq 0$, the value of $w$ is uniquely determined. This suggests that we can use $x, y,$ and $z$ as independent parameters for our chart.\n\nWe now construct the parameterization map $\\phi: U \\to M$. We identify the domain coordinates $(u, v, t)$ with the independent coordinates $(x, y, z)$.\nLet:\n$x = u$\n$y = v$\n$z = t$\n\nSubstituting these into our expression for $w$ gives:\n$$ w = \\frac{u^2 + v^2 - 1}{t} $$\nCombining these, we form the parameterization map $\\phi(u, v, t)$ which maps a point in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to a point $(x,y,z,w)$ on the manifold $M$:\n$$ \\phi(u, v, t) = \\left( u, v, t, \\frac{u^2 + v^2 - 1}{t} \\right) $$\nFor this map to be well-defined, the denominator cannot be zero. This means $t \\neq 0$. The domain of this chart is therefore $U = \\{(u,v,t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid t \\neq 0\\}$, which is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The image of this map is the set of points on $M$ where $z \\neq 0$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. $\\phi(u, v) = (u, v, 1, u^2 + v^2 - 1)$: This map's domain is in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, not $\\mathbb{R}^3$. It parameterizes a 2-dimensional subset of $M$ (where $z=1$), not a 3-dimensional open neighborhood. So, it is incorrect.\nB. $\\phi(u, v, t) = \\left(u, v, t, \\frac{u^2 + v^2 - 1}{t}\\right)$: This matches our derived parameterization. Let's verify it satisfies the manifold equation: $x^2+y^2-zw = u^2 + v^2 - t\\left(\\frac{u^2 + v^2 - 1}{t}\\right) = u^2 + v^2 - (u^2 + v^2 - 1) = 1$. This is correct.\nC. $\\phi(u, v, t) = \\left(u, v, \\frac{u^2 + v^2 - 1}{t}, t\\right)$: This map sets $z = \\frac{u^2 + v^2 - 1}{t}$ and $w=t$. It parameterizes the part of the manifold where $w \\neq 0$, which is not what was asked. So, it is incorrect.\nD. $\\phi(u, v, t) = \\left(u, v, t, \\frac{1 - u^2 - v^2}{t}\\right)$: Let's check the manifold equation: $x^2+y^2-zw = u^2 + v^2 - t\\left(\\frac{1 - u^2 - v^2}{t}\\right) = u^2 + v^2 - (1 - u^2 - v^2) = 2u^2 + 2v^2 - 1$. This is not equal to 1. So, it is incorrect.\nE. $\\phi(u, v, t) = (u, v, t, u^2+v^2-t-1)$: Let's check the manifold equation: $x^2+y^2-zw = u^2 + v^2 - t(u^2+v^2-t-1) = u^2+v^2-tu^2-tv^2+t^2+t$.
