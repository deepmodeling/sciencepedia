This practice explores a classic counterexample, the double cone, to test our understanding of this fundamental requirement. By examining the structure around the cone's vertex, we can see why this seemingly simple shape fails to be a submanifold and understand the importance of the Regular Value Theorem's conditions [@problem_id:1636908].", "problem": "Consider the set $S$ in three-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by the equation $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$. This equation describes a double cone with its vertex at the origin. In differential geometry, a key question is whether a given set qualifies as an embedded submanifold. An embedded submanifold is a subset that locally \"looks like\" a flat Euclidean space.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete description of the set $S$ with respect to the definition of an embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^3$?\n\nA. $S$ is not a submanifold because the local topological structure at the origin is not homeomorphic to an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ for any integer $k \\ge 1$.\nB. $S$ is a 2-dimensional embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ because it is defined as the zero set of the smooth function $f(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2-z^2$.\nC. $S$ fails to be a submanifold only at the origin, but since this is a single point, $S$ is considered an embedded submanifold with a singularity.\nD. $S$ is a 1-dimensional embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\nE. $S$ is not a submanifold because it is not a closed subset of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.", "solution": "Let $f:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(x,y,z)=x^{2}+y^{2}-z^{2}$. Then $S=f^{-1}(0)$. By the regular level set (embedded submanifold) theorem, if $0$ is a regular value of $f$, then $S$ is a $2$-dimensional embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. A value $0$ is regular if and only if $\\nabla f\\neq 0$ at every point of $f^{-1}(0)$.\n\nCompute the gradient:\n$$\n\\nabla f(x,y,z)=(2x,\\,2y,\\,-2z).\n$$\nOn $S$, $\\nabla f=0$ if and only if $(x,y,z)=(0,0,0)$. Hence $0$ is not a regular value of $f$ because the gradient vanishes at the origin. It follows that we cannot conclude that $S$ is an embedded submanifold at the origin. However, for any point $p\\in S\\setminus\\{0\\}$, we have $\\nabla f(p)\\neq 0$, so by the implicit function theorem $S$ is a $2$-dimensional embedded submanifold in a neighborhood of $p$. Thus $S\\setminus\\{0\\}$ is a smooth embedded surface, and the only potential failure of the manifold property is at the origin.\n\nWe now show that $S$ is not a manifold at the origin. Suppose for contradiction that there exists $k\\geq 1$ such that the origin has a neighborhood in $S$ homeomorphic to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{k}$. Because points of $S$ arbitrarily close to the origin (with $z\\neq 0$) are $2$-manifold points by the implicit function theorem, any manifold structure on a connected neighborhood containing such points forces $k=2$. Therefore, if $S$ were a manifold near the origin, it would have to be $2$-dimensional there.\n\nLet $r>0$ and consider $N=S\\cap B_{r}(0)$, where $B_{r}(0)=\\{(x,y,z):x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}<r^{2}\\}$.

By contrast, if $N$ were homeomorphic to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, then removing a single point from an open disk in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ leaves a connected set. Connectedness is a topological invariant, so $N$ cannot be homeomorphic to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Therefore the origin is not a $2$-manifold point of $S$.\n\nConsequently, there is no $k\\geq 1$ such that the origin has a neighborhood in $S$ homeomorphic to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{k}$. Hence $S$ is not an embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Evaluating the options:\n\n- A is correct: the local topology at the origin is not homeomorphic to any open set in $\\mathbb{R}^{k}$, so $S$ is not a submanifold.\n- B is false: the regular value condition fails at the origin.\n- C is false: having even a single singular point prevents $S$ from being an embedded submanifold.\n- D is false: away from the origin $S$ is $2$-dimensional, so it cannot be $1$-dimensional.\n- E is false: $S=f^{-1}(0)$ with $f$ continuous, so $S$ is closed; in any case, closedness is irrelevant to being a submanifold.\n\nTherefore the most accurate and complete description is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1636908"}, {"introduction": "When a manifold is described by a parameterization, we need tools to translate calculus from the flat parameter domain to the curved manifold.
