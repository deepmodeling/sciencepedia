Such a function must be \"smooth,\" which in a mathematical context means it is infinitely differentiable, or of class $C^\\infty$.\n\nConsider the task of defining a non-zero potential function $\\Phi: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is identically zero for all positions $x \\le 0$, but becomes positive for $x > 0$. For the function to be smooth over all of $\\mathbb{R}$, its value and the values of all its derivatives must be continuous at the transition point $x=0$. Given that $\\Phi(x) = 0$ for $x \\le 0$, this requires that the limit of the function and all its derivatives must approach zero as $x$ approaches $0$ from the positive side.\n\nWhich of the following definitions for $\\Phi(x)$ for $x > 0$, when combined with the definition $\\Phi(x) = 0$ for $x \\le 0$, results in a non-constant, smooth function on all of $\\mathbb{R}$?\n\nA. $\\Phi(x) = x^4$\n\nB. $\\Phi(x) = \\sin(x^2)$\n\nC. $\\Phi(x) = \\exp(-\\frac{1}{x})$\n\nD. $\\Phi(x) = 1 - \\cos(x)$\n\nE.

Therefore smoothness at $x=0$ is equivalent to the condition that, for every integer $n\\geq 0$,\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}} f^{(n)}(x)=0.\n$$\nWe test each option.\n\nOption A: $f(x)=x^{4}$. For $x>0$, $f^{(k)}(x)$ equals $4x^{3}$, $12x^{2}$, $24x$, $24$ for $k=1,2,3,4$, respectively.

First, $f(x)>0$ for $x>0$ and $\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}} f(x)=0$.
