By definition, this means that $E$ can be written as the direct sum of two line bundles, say $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n$$E = L_1 \\oplus L_2$$\nA fundamental property of Chern classes is the Whitney sum formula, which relates the total Chern class of a direct sum of bundles to the total Chern classes of the summands. For $E = L_1 \\oplus L_2$, the formula is:\n$$c(E) = c(L_1 \\oplus L_2) = c(L_1) \\smile c(L_2)$$\nwhere $c(V)$ denotes the total Chern class of a vector bundle $V$, and $\\smile$ is the cup product in the cohomology ring $H^*(\\mathbb{C}P^2; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe total Chern class of a bundle $V$ is defined as $c(V) = 1 + c_1(V) + c_2(V) + \\dots$. For the given bundle $E$, we have $c_1(E)=0$ and $c_2(E)=k \\alpha^2$. Since $E$ is a rank 2 bundle, all higher Chern classes $c_i(E)$ for $i > 2$ are zero. Thus, the total Chern class of $E$ is:\n$$c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E) = 1 + 0 + k \\alpha^2 = 1 + k \\alpha^2$$\n\nNow, let's consider the line bundles $L_1$ and $L_2$. For any line bundle $L$, it has rank 1, so its Chern classes $c_i(L)$ are zero for $i > 1$. Its total Chern class is simply $c(L) = 1 + c_1(L)$.\nThe first Chern class of a line bundle over $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ must be an element of $H^2(\\mathbb{C}P^2; \\mathbb{Z})$.

Coefficient of $\\alpha^2$: $k = n_1 n_2$.\n\nNow, we substitute the result from the first equation into the second equation:\n$$k = n_1(-n_1) = -n_1^2$$\nThis shows that for the bundle $E$ to be decomposable, the integer $k$ must be the negative of a perfect square of an integer. Since the problem states $k \\neq 0$, we must have $n_1 \\neq 0$. So, $E$ is decomposable if and only if $k \\in \\{-1, -4, -9, -16, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that $E$ is decomposable if and only if $-k$ is a positive perfect square (i.e., $-k = n_1^2$ for some non-zero integer $n_1$).\n\nThe problem asks for the condition that *prevents* $E$ from being decomposable. This is the negation of the condition we just found. Therefore, $E$ is not decomposable if and only if $k$ cannot be written in the form $-n^2$ for any non-zero integer $n$. This is the same as saying that $-k$ is not a perfect square of a non-zero integer. Since $0$ is a perfect square, but $k \\neq 0$, the condition simplifies to: $-k$ is not a perfect square.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA. $k$ is a positive integer. If $k0$, then $k = -n^2$ is impossible for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, n \\neq 0$. So this is a sufficient condition, but not necessary (e.g., if $k=-3$, E does not split, but $k$ is not positive).\nB. $k$ is an odd integer. If $k=-9$, it is odd, but $E$ splits ($n=3$). Thus, this is incorrect.\nC. $-k$ is a prime number. If $-k=p$ (a prime), then $p$ is not a perfect square. This is a sufficient condition, but not necessary (e.g., if $-k=6$, E does not split, but 6 is not prime).\nD. $-k$ is not a perfect square. This is the necessary and sufficient condition we derived.\nE. $k$ is not a perfect square. If $k=-4$, $k$ is not a perfect square, yet $E$ splits ($n=2$).
