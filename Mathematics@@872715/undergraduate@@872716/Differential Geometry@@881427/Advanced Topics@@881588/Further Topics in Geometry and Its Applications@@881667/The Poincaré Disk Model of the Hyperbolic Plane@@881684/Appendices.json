The hyperbolic radius $R_H$ is the hyperbolic distance from the origin to any point on the circle. Due to the symmetry of the metric, the shortest path (a geodesic) from the origin to a point on a circle of Euclidean radius $R_E$ is a straight Euclidean line segment.\n\nLet's calculate the hyperbolic length of a radial line segment from the origin $(0,0)$ to a point on the Euclidean circle of radius $R_E$. We can choose the point $(R_E, 0)$ without loss of generality. This path can be parameterized by $x(t) = t$ and $y(t) = 0$ for $t \\in [0, R_E]$.\n\nFor this path, the differentials are $dx = dt$ and $dy = 0$. The squared Euclidean distance from the origin at any point along the path is $x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = t^2$. We substitute these into the line element formula to find the infinitesimal hyperbolic length $ds$:\n$$ds^2 = \\frac{4(dt^2 + 0^2)}{(1 - t^2)^2} = \\frac{4 dt^2}{(1 - t^2)^2}$$\nTaking the square root, we get the infinitesimal length element:\n$$ds = \\frac{2 dt}{1 - t^2}$$\nNote that since $R_E < 1$, $t \\in [0, R_E)$ is always less than 1, so $1 - t^2$ is always positive.\n\nThe total hyperbolic distance $R_H$ is the integral of $ds$ along the path from $t=0$ to $t=R_E$:\n$$R_H = \\int_0^{R_E} \\frac{2}{1 - t^2} dt$$\nThis is a standard integral.
