## Introduction
In the study of differential geometry, a fundamental question arises: given a smooth assignment of a $k$-dimensional tangent plane to every point on a manifold, can these planes be integrated to form a coherent family of $k$-dimensional surfaces? This inquiry is the starting point for the [theory of distributions](@entry_id:275605) and foliations, a cornerstone concept that bridges local geometry with global structure. The central problem this theory addresses is determining the conditions under which a field of planes is "integrable." Answering this question provides profound insights not only within geometry itself but also across numerous scientific fields where such structures appear, including mechanics, control theory, and even statistics. This article provides a comprehensive introduction to this theory. In the 'Principles and Mechanisms' section, we will lay the theoretical groundwork by defining distributions, introducing the crucial algebraic tool of the Lie bracket, and stating the celebrated Frobenius Integrability Theorem. Following this, the 'Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections' section will explore how this framework is used to model physical systems, analyze symmetries, and solve problems in fields as diverse as Hamiltonian mechanics and [information geometry](@entry_id:141183). Finally, the 'Hands-On Practices' section will offer the opportunity to solidify these concepts by working through practical examples.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the study of smooth manifolds, we often seek to understand how local geometric structures integrate to form global objects. One of the most fundamental questions in this vein is whether a field of tangent planes can be "woven" into a consistent family of surfaces. This inquiry leads us to the [theory of distributions](@entry_id:275605) and foliations, a cornerstone of [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818) with profound implications for differential equations, mechanics, and control theory. This chapter lays out the principles governing this theory, centered on the celebrated theorem of Frobenius.

### Defining and Visualizing Distributions

A **smooth distribution** on a manifold is a systematic assignment of a [vector subspace](@entry_id:151815) of the tangent space to each point. More formally, a smooth distribution $\mathcal{D}$ of **rank** $k$ on an $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ is a choice of a $k$-dimensional subspace $\mathcal{D}_p \subseteq T_pM$ for each point $p \in M$, which varies smoothly across the manifold. The integer $k$ is called the rank of the distribution, and the integer $n-k$ is its **codimension**.

What does it mean for the assignment to "vary smoothly"? It means that for any point $p \in M$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ and a set of $k$ smooth vector fields $\{X_1, \dots, X_k\}$ defined on $U$ such that for every point $q \in U$, the vectors $\{X_1(q), \dots, X_k(q)\}$ form a basis for the subspace $\mathcal{D}_q$. Such a set of vector fields is called a **[local basis](@entry_id:151573)** or **local frame** for the distribution.

For example, a rank-1 distribution is simply a field of lines, specified locally by a single non-vanishing vector field. A rank-2 distribution on $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be visualized as a "plane field," where a 2-dimensional plane is attached to each point in space. These planes are not arbitrary; their orientation must change smoothly from point to point.

### The Question of Integrability: From Plane Fields to Foliations

Once we have a distribution, a natural and crucial question arises: Does there exist a $k$-dimensional [submanifold](@entry_id:262388) $S \subseteq M$ whose [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) at every point $p \in S$ is precisely the subspace defined by the distribution? That is, does $T_pS = \mathcal{D}_p$ for all $p \in S$?

If such a [submanifold](@entry_id:262388) $S$ exists, it is called an **[integral submanifold](@entry_id:274360)** of the distribution $\mathcal{D}$. A distribution is said to be **integrable** if, through every point of the manifold, there passes an [integral submanifold](@entry_id:274360).

When a distribution is integrable, it partitions the entire manifold into a family of disjoint, connected, maximal integral submanifolds. This partition is known as a **[foliation](@entry_id:160209)**, and the individual submanifolds are called the **leaves** of the [foliation](@entry_id:160209). The image is one of the manifold being sliced into a stack of "leaves," much like the pages of a book or the layers of an onion.

A simple yet illustrative example is the distribution on $M = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{(0,0)\}$ spanned by the single vector field $X = -y \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + x \frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ [@problem_id:1635911]. At any point $(x,y)$, the vector $X(x,y) = (-y, x)$ is perpendicular to the [position vector](@entry_id:168381) $(x,y)$. This means the distribution consists of lines tangent to circles centered at the origin. The [integral curves](@entry_id:161858) of this vector field are paths $\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ satisfying $\dot{x} = -y$ and $\dot{y} = x$. One can quickly verify that $\frac{d}{dt}(x^2+y^2) = 2x\dot{x} + 2y\dot{y} = 2x(-y) + 2y(x) = 0$. This implies that any [integral curve](@entry_id:276251) must lie on a circle of constant radius. The leaves of the corresponding [foliation](@entry_id:160209) are therefore the concentric circles centered at the origin.

### The Lie Bracket and Involutivity

The geometric property of integrability turns out to be captured by a purely algebraic condition on the [vector fields](@entry_id:161384) that span the distribution. The essential tool for this is the **Lie bracket**. For two smooth vector fields $X$ and $Y$, their Lie bracket, denoted $[X,Y]$, is another vector field defined by the action on any [smooth function](@entry_id:158037) $f$:
$$ [X,Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f)) $$
The Lie bracket measures the failure of the flows generated by $X$ and $Y$ to commute. If you flow along $X$ for a short time, then along $Y$, you will arrive at a different point than if you had flowed along $Y$ first, then $X$. The Lie bracket vector $[X,Y]$ points in the direction of this infinitesimal discrepancy.

This geometric intuition suggests that if a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ is integrable, its constituent [vector fields](@entry_id:161384) must "cooperate" in a specific way. If we start on an [integral submanifold](@entry_id:274360) and move along [vector fields](@entry_id:161384) $X$ and $Y$ that are both tangent to it, any infinitesimal [non-commutativity](@entry_id:153545) should not "push" us off the submanifold. This means the resulting vector $[X,Y]$ must also be tangent to the [submanifold](@entry_id:262388).

This leads to the crucial algebraic concept of **involutivity**. A distribution $\mathcal{D}$ is called **involutive** if for any two vector fields $X$ and $Y$ that are sections of $\mathcal{D}$ (i.e., $X(p), Y(p) \in \mathcal{D}_p$ for all $p$), their Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ is also a section of $\mathcal{D}$.

To check for involutivity, we do not need to test all possible pairs of [vector fields](@entry_id:161384). It is sufficient to check the condition for a [local basis](@entry_id:151573). If $\{X_1, \dots, X_k\}$ is a [local basis](@entry_id:151573) for $\mathcal{D}$, the distribution is involutive if and only if for every pair $i,j$, the Lie bracket $[X_i, X_j]$ can be expressed as a [linear combination](@entry_id:155091) of the basis vectors:
$$ [X_i, X_j](p) = \sum_{l=1}^k c_{ij}^l(p) X_l(p) $$
for some [smooth functions](@entry_id:138942) $c_{ij}^l$.

A particularly important property of the Lie bracket is its behavior with respect to multiplication by functions. For a [smooth function](@entry_id:158037) $g$, we have:
$$ [X, gY] = g[X,Y] + (Xg)Y $$
This identity immediately reveals that any 1-dimensional distribution is involutive. A rank-1 distribution is spanned by a single vector field $X$. Any two [vector fields](@entry_id:161384) in the distribution can be written as $Y_1 = fX$ and $Y_2 = gX$ for some smooth functions $f$ and $g$. Their Lie bracket is $[fX, gX] = f[X,gX] - (gXf)X = f(g[X,X] + (Xg)X) - (gXf)X$. Since $[X,X]=0$, this simplifies to $(f(Xg) - g(Xf))X$, which is manifestly a multiple of $X$ and thus lies within the distribution [@problem_id:1635889].

### The Frobenius Theorem: The Bridge Between Algebra and Geometry

The connection between the geometric concept of [integrability](@entry_id:142415) and the algebraic condition of involutivity is made precise by the **Frobenius Integrability Theorem**, one of the most fundamental results in [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818).

**Theorem (Frobenius):** A smooth distribution is integrable if and only if it is involutive.

This theorem is powerful because it transforms a difficult geometric problem (finding [submanifolds](@entry_id:159439)) into a tractable algebraic calculation (computing Lie brackets).

Let's see this in action. Consider the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$ spanned by $V_1 = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ and $V_2 = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + x^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ [@problem_id:1635903]. To check for [integrability](@entry_id:142415), we compute the Lie bracket:
$$ [V_1, V_2] = \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + x^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right] = \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right] + \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, x^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right] $$
The first term is zero as [coordinate vector](@entry_id:153319) fields commute. For the second term, we use the identity $[X, fY] = (Xf)Y + f[X,Y]$:
$$ \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, x^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right] = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x^2)\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial z} + x^2 \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right] = 2x \frac{\partial}{\partial z} + 0 = 2x \frac{\partial}{\partial z} $$
So, $[V_1, V_2] = 2x \frac{\partial}{\partial z}$. Is this vector field in the distribution $\mathcal{D}$? If it were, we could write $2x \frac{\partial}{\partial z} = aV_1 + bV_2$ for some functions $a(x,y,z)$ and $b(x,y,z)$. Expanding this gives:
$$ 2x \frac{\partial}{\partial z} = a \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + b \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + x^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right) = a \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + b \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + b x^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial z} $$
Comparing coefficients of the basis vectors $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z}$, we must have $a=0$, $b=0$, and $2x = bx^2$. The first two equations imply the third becomes $2x = 0$, which is only true if $x=0$. Since this does not hold everywhere, the vector field $[V_1, V_2]$ is not in the span of $V_1$ and $V_2$. The distribution is not involutive and therefore, by the Frobenius theorem, it is not integrable. There are no surfaces whose tangent planes are given by $\mathcal{D}$. The Lie bracket has revealed a direction "of twisting" that prevents the planes from meshing together. A similar analysis shows that the distribution spanned by $X_1 = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + z \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ and $X_2 = \frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ is also not integrable, as their bracket $[X_1, X_2] = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ lies outside the distribution [@problem_id:1635913].

The Frobenius theorem has another profound consequence. It guarantees that if a distribution *is* integrable, then one can always find a special [local coordinate system](@entry_id:751394) that "flattens" the distribution [@problem_id:1635892]. Specifically, for any integrable rank-$k$ distribution on an $n$-manifold, there exists a local [coordinate chart](@entry_id:263963) $(u_1, \dots, u_k, w_1, \dots, w_{n-k})$ around any point such that the distribution is spanned by the first $k$ [coordinate vector](@entry_id:153319) fields, $\{\frac{\partial}{\partial u_1}, \dots, \frac{\partial}{\partial u_k}\}$. In these "adapted" coordinates, the leaves of the [foliation](@entry_id:160209) are simply the slices where the $w_j$ coordinates are held constant. This means that locally, every [foliation](@entry_id:160209) looks like a stack of [parallel planes](@entry_id:165919) in Euclidean space.

### Distributions Defined by Differential Forms

There is a dual perspective to distributions that is often extremely useful, particularly for distributions of codimension 1. A rank-$(n-1)$ distribution on an $n$-manifold can be defined as the kernel of a single, nowhere-vanishing [1-form](@entry_id:275851) $\omega$. At each point $p$, the subspace $\mathcal{D}_p$ consists of all [tangent vectors](@entry_id:265494) $v \in T_pM$ such that $\omega_p(v) = 0$.

In this language, the Frobenius [integrability condition](@entry_id:160334) takes a particularly elegant form. A distribution $\mathcal{D} = \ker \omega$ is integrable if and only if
$$ \omega \wedge d\omega = 0 $$
where $d\omega$ is the [exterior derivative](@entry_id:161900) of $\omega$. The expression $\omega \wedge d\omega$ is a 3-form, and the condition is that this 3-form must vanish identically. The intuition behind this condition comes from the formula relating the exterior derivative to the Lie bracket: $d\omega(X,Y) = X(\omega(Y)) - Y(\omega(X)) - \omega([X,Y])$. If $X$ and $Y$ are in the distribution, then $\omega(X)=0$ and $\omega(Y)=0$. The formula simplifies to $d\omega(X,Y) = -\omega([X,Y])$. For the distribution to be involutive, we require $[X,Y]$ to also be in the kernel, meaning $\omega([X,Y])=0$. Thus, [integrability](@entry_id:142415) requires $d\omega(X,Y)=0$ for all $X, Y \in \mathcal{D}$. The condition $\omega \wedge d\omega=0$ is precisely the statement that $d\omega$ vanishes when restricted to the distribution $\mathcal{D}$.

Let's test this on the 1-form $\omega = yz \, dx + xz \, dy + xy \, dz$ on the positive octant of $\mathbb{R}^3$ [@problem_id:1635879]. Its kernel defines a 2-dimensional distribution. We compute the [exterior derivative](@entry_id:161900):
$$ d\omega = d(yz \ dx) + d(xz \ dy) + d(xy \ dz) $$
$$ d\omega = (z\,dy + y\,dz)\wedge dx + (z\,dx + x\,dz)\wedge dy + (y\,dx + x\,dy)\wedge dz $$
$$ d\omega = (z\,dy\wedge dx + y\,dz\wedge dx) + (z\,dx\wedge dy + x\,dz\wedge dy) + (y\,dx\wedge dz + x\,dy\wedge dz) $$
Using the [anti-symmetry](@entry_id:184837) of the [wedge product](@entry_id:147029) (e.g., $dy\wedge dx = -dx\wedge dy$), we see that the terms cancel in pairs: $(-z+z)dx\wedge dy + (-y+y)dx\wedge dz + (-x+x)dy\wedge dz = 0$. Since $d\omega = 0$, the condition $\omega \wedge d\omega = 0$ is trivially satisfied. The distribution is integrable. In fact, in this case, we can observe that $\omega = d(xyz)$. A 1-form that is the [differential of a function](@entry_id:274991) is called **exact**. The condition $d\omega=0$ means the form is **closed**. The integral submanifolds are precisely the [level sets](@entry_id:151155) of the function $f(x,y,z)=xyz$, i.e., surfaces of the form $xyz=c$ for some constant $c$.

### Beyond Integrability: Derived Distributions and Contact Structures

When a distribution fails to be involutive, the Lie bracket produces vector fields that point in new directions. We can systematically study this "failure" by expanding our distribution. The **derived distribution**, denoted $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}$, is the distribution spanned by the original fields in $\mathcal{D}$ together with all their Lie brackets:
$$ \mathcal{D}^{(1)}_p = \text{span}\{\mathcal{D}_p, [X,Y](p) \mid X,Y \text{ are sections of } \mathcal{D}\} $$
If $\mathcal{D}^{(1)} = \mathcal{D}$, the distribution is involutive. If not, $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}$ has a rank strictly greater than $\mathcal{D}$. We can repeat this process, forming a chain of derived distributions $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{D}^{(1)} \subseteq \mathcal{D}^{(2)} \subseteq \dots$. This sequence must stabilize in a finite number of steps, yielding the smallest [involutive distribution](@entry_id:158364) containing $\mathcal{D}$, known as the **involutive closure** of $\mathcal{D}$.

A particularly important class of non-integrable distributions are **contact structures**. A [contact structure](@entry_id:635649) on a $(2n+1)$-dimensional manifold is a rank-$2n$ distribution $\mathcal{D}$ that is "maximally non-integrable," meaning its derived distribution spans the entire [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) at every point: $\mathcal{D}^{(1)} = TM$.

A classic example is the distribution on $\mathbb{R}^3$ spanned by $X = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} - \frac{y}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ and $Y = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \frac{x}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ [@problem_id:1635925]. This is a rank-2 distribution. A calculation of the Lie bracket yields:
$$ [X,Y] = \frac{\partial}{\partial z} $$
The derived distribution $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}$ is spanned by $\{X, Y, [X,Y]\}$. In the [coordinate basis](@entry_id:270149), these three vectors are $(1, 0, -y/2)$, $(0, 1, x/2)$, and $(0, 0, 1)$. These three vectors are linearly independent at every point in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Thus, the rank of $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}$ is 3. The original 2-dimensional planes twist in such a way that their infinitesimal non-commutativity generates the missing third dimension, filling the entire tangent space.

This phenomenon generalizes. On $\mathbb{R}^5$ with coordinates $(x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2, z)$, the [1-form](@entry_id:275851) $\omega = dz + x_1 dy_1 + x_2 dy_2$ defines a rank-4 contact distribution $\mathcal{D} = \ker \omega$ [@problem_id:1635901]. Taking brackets of basis vectors of $\mathcal{D}$, such as $[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y_1} - x_1 \frac{\partial}{\partial z} ]$, produces the vector $-\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$. This vector is not in $\mathcal{D}$, since $\omega(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}) = 1 \neq 0$. This single new direction is enough to show that the derived distribution $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}$ has rank 5, again filling the entire [tangent space](@entry_id:141028).

### Application: Involutive Distributions on Lie Groups

The [theory of distributions](@entry_id:275605) finds a natural and elegant application in the context of Lie groups. A Lie group is a manifold that is also a group, with smooth multiplication and inversion maps. The [tangent space at the identity](@entry_id:266468) element, $\mathfrak{g} = T_eG$, is the Lie algebra of the group, equipped with a bracket operation that corresponds to the Lie bracket of vector fields.

For any element $A \in \mathfrak{g}$, one can define a **[left-invariant vector field](@entry_id:267045)** $X_A$ on the group $G$ by setting $X_A(g) = L_{g*}A$, where $L_g$ is left multiplication by $g$. A remarkable property is that the Lie bracket of two [left-invariant vector fields](@entry_id:637116) corresponds directly to the Lie algebra bracket of their generating elements:
$$ [X_A, X_B] = X_{[A,B]} $$
Now, consider a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ on $G$ spanned by a set of [left-invariant vector fields](@entry_id:637116) $\{X_{A_1}, \dots, X_{A_k}\}$. This distribution is involutive if and only if the [vector subspace](@entry_id:151815) $\mathfrak{h} = \text{span}\{A_1, \dots, A_k\} \subseteq \mathfrak{g}$ is a **Lie subalgebra**, meaning it is closed under the Lie algebra bracket. If it is, the Frobenius theorem implies that this distribution is integrable, and its leaves are the [cosets](@entry_id:147145) of the unique connected Lie subgroup corresponding to the subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$.

For example, consider the Lie group $G = GL(2, \mathbb{R})$ of invertible $2 \times 2$ matrices. Its Lie algebra is the space of all $2 \times 2$ matrices, $\mathfrak{gl}(2, \mathbb{R})$, with bracket $[A,B] = AB-BA$. Let's define a rank-2 distribution $\mathcal{D}$ using the matrices $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\ 0  0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\ 1  0 \end{pmatrix}$ [@problem_id:1635922]. The subspace $\text{span}\{A,B\}$ is not a Lie subalgebra, because their commutator is:
$$ [A,B] = AB - BA = \begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\ 0  0 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\ 0  1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\ 0  -1 \end{pmatrix} = H $$
The matrix $H$ is not a linear combination of $A$ and $B$. Therefore, the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ is not involutive. To find its involutive closure, we must add the new direction defined by $H$ and check for closure again. We compute further [commutators](@entry_id:158878): $[H,A] = 2A$ and $[H,B] = -2B$. Since these are already in the span of $\{A,B,H\}$, the subspace $\mathfrak{h} = \text{span}\{A,B,H\}$ is a 3-dimensional Lie subalgebra. This is the well-known algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ of traceless $2 \times 2$ matrices. The involutive closure of $\mathcal{D}$ is the rank-3 distribution spanned by the [left-invariant vector fields](@entry_id:637116) corresponding to $\{A,B,H\}$.

In conclusion, the concept of a distribution provides a framework for analyzing the geometric structure of vector fields on a manifold. The Frobenius theorem serves as the ultimate arbiter, using the algebraic tool of the Lie bracket to decide the geometric question of [integrability](@entry_id:142415). This interplay between algebra and geometry is a recurring and powerful theme throughout modern mathematics.
