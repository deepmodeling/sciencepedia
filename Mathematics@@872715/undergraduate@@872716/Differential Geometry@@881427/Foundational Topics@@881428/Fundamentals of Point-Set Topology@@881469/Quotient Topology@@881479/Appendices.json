This first practice provides a classic and highly visual example of this process. By defining an equivalence relation that treats all points on the boundary of a triangle as a single entity, we can explore how this abstract \"gluing\" operation transforms a simple, flat shape into a familiar curved surface. [@problem_id:1659652]", "problem": "Consider a closed, filled-in triangular region $T$ in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $\\partial T$ denote the boundary of this triangle, which consists of its three edges. We define an equivalence relation $\\sim$ on the points of $T$. For any two points $p_1$ and $p_2$ in $T$, we say $p_1 \\sim p_2$ if and only if one of the following two conditions holds:\n1. $p_1 = p_2$.\n2. Both $p_1$ and $p_2$ lie on the boundary $\\partial T$.\n\nThis equivalence relation identifies all points on the boundary of the triangle to a single equivalence class, while every point in the interior of the triangle forms its own equivalence class.

The Möbius strip", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the topological space created by taking a filled-in triangle $T$ and collapsing its entire boundary $\\partial T$ to a single point. Let this quotient space be $X = T/\\sim$.\n\nFirst, we recognize a fundamental principle in topology: a closed, filled-in triangular region in the plane is topologically equivalent to a closed 2-dimensional disk, $D^2 = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 \\le 1\\}$. This means there exists a homeomorphism $f: T \\to D^2$. A homeomorphism is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse, which essentially means we can continuously deform the triangle into a disk without tearing or gluing. This deformation would map the interior of the triangle to the interior of the disk, and, crucially, the boundary of the triangle, $\\partial T$, to the boundary of the disk, $\\partial D^2$, which is the circle $S^1$.\n\nThe equivalence relation $\\sim$ on $T$ identifies all points in $\\partial T$ to a single point. Since the homeomorphism $f$ maps $\\partial T$ to $\\partial D^2$, the identification on $T$ is topologically equivalent to performing a similar identification on $D^2$. The corresponding equivalence relation on $D^2$ would identify all points on its boundary circle $\\partial D^2$ to a single point.\n\nNow, let's visualize this process on the disk $D^2$. Imagine the disk is a flexible, circular piece of cloth with a drawstring along its edge (the boundary circle $\\partial D^2$). The operation of identifying all points on the boundary to a single point is equivalent to pulling the drawstring tight, closing the opening. As we pull the drawstring, the flat disk puckers and closes up, forming a bag-like shape with no opening. This resulting closed surface has the shape of a sphere.\n\nTo be more formal, consider the 2-sphere $S^2$ (e.g., the surface of a globe). We can think of the disk $D^2$ as, for instance, the Northern Hemisphere. Its boundary, $\\partial D^2$, is the equator. The operation of collapsing this boundary circle to a single point corresponds to shrinking the entire equator down to a single point. If we do this, the Northern Hemisphere closes up to form a full sphere, with the equator now collapsed into what would be the South Pole. Thus, the space $D^2/\\partial D^2$ is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, $S^2$.\n\nSince the original space $X = T/\\sim$ is homeomorphic to $D^2/\\partial D^2$, we can conclude that $X$ is homeomorphic to $S^2$.\n\nLet's analyze the other options to confirm our choice:\n- The 2-torus ($T^2$) is formed by identifying opposite sides of a square. It has \"one hole\" (genus 1), whereas a sphere has \"no holes\" (genus 0).\n- The real projective plane ($\\mathbb{R}P^2$) is formed by identifying antipodal points on the boundary of a disk. This is a different identification and results in a non-orientable surface. Our resulting space, the sphere, is orientable.\n- A cylinder is formed by identifying only one pair of opposite sides of a rectangle. It has two boundary circles. The space $X$ has no boundary.\n- A Möbius strip is formed by identifying one pair of opposite sides of a rectangle with a twist. It has one boundary circle and is non-orientable.\n\nTherefore, the only space that matches our construction is the 2-sphere.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1659652"}, {"introduction": "Building on the idea of geometric identification, this exercise introduces a more intricate gluing rule on the unit square.

Hence these image points are interior points of $Y$.\n- At the corners, $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ are identified to a single point. A neighborhood of this identified point in $Y$ is obtained by gluing two quarter-disks along one boundary ray, which yields a half-disk neighborhood; thus this point is a boundary point in $Y$.\n- Points on $T\\setminus\\{(0,1),(1,1)\\}$ and $R\\setminus\\{(1,0),(1,1)\\}$ have neighborhoods in $X$ that are half-disks and are unaffected by the quotient; their images remain boundary points in $Y$.\n\nTherefore $Y$ is a compact connected 2-manifold with boundary, and the boundary is precisely the image of $T\\cup R$, which forms a single simple closed curve (a copy of $S^1$).\n\nCell structure and Euler characteristic:\nLet us record the identifications of vertices and edges of the boundary of the square:\n- Vertices: $A=q(0,0)$, $E=q(0,1)=q(1,0)$, $D=q(1,1)$.
