To solve this, we can use the Implicit Function Theorem.\n\nFirst, let's represent the curve as the zero level set of a function $F(x,y)$. Let\n$$F(x,y) = (x^2+y^2)^2 - 2a^2(x^2-y^2) = 0$$\n\nThe Implicit Function Theorem states that for a continuously differentiable function $F(x,y)$, we can locally solve for $y$ as a smooth function of $x$ near a point $(x_0, y_0)$ on the curve $F(x,y)=0$ if the partial derivative of $F$ with respect to $y$ is non-zero at that point, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(x_0, y_0) \\neq 0$.\n\nTherefore, the points where we *cannot* locally express $y$ as a function of $x$ are the points on the curve where $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 0$. These points typically correspond to vertical tangents or singularities like self-intersections.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivative of $F(x,y)$ with respect to $y$. It is helpful to first expand the expression for $F(x,y)$:\n$$F(x,y) = x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 - 2a^2x^2 + 2a^2y^2$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $y$, treating $x$ as a constant:\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 - 2a^2x^2 + 2a^2y^2)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 0 + 4x^2y + 4y^3 - 0 + 4a^2y$$\nFactoring out the common term $4y$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 4y(x^2 + y^2 + a^2)$$\n\nWe are looking for points where this partial derivative is zero:\n$$4y(x^2 + y^2 + a^2) = 0$$\nThis equation holds true if either $y=0$ or $x^2 + y^2 + a^2 = 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the second case: $x^2 + y^2 + a^2 = 0$. Since $x$ and $y$ are real coordinates, $x^2 \\ge 0$ and $y^2 \\ge 0$. The problem states that $a$ is a positive real constant, so $a^2 > 0$. The sum of two non-negative terms and a strictly positive term, $x^2 + y^2 + a^2$, must be strictly positive. Thus, $x^2 + y^2 + a^2 > 0$, and this condition can never be met for real $x, y, a$.\n\nThis leaves us with the only possibility for $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}=0$, which is $y=0$.\n\nNow we must find the points on the original curve that satisfy the condition $y=0$. We substitute $y=0$ back into the curve's equation:\n$$(x^2+y^2)^2 = 2a^2(x^2-y^2)$$\n$$(x^2+0^2)^2 = 2a^2(x^2-0^2)$$\n$$(x^2)^2 = 2a^2x^2$$\n$$x^4 = 2a^2x^2$$\nTo solve for $x$, we move all terms to one side:\n$$x^4 - 2a^2x^2 = 0$$\nFactor out $x^2$:\n$$x^2(x^2 - 2a^2) = 0$$\nThis gives two possibilities for $x$:\n1. $x^2 = 0 \\implies x=0$. This gives the point $(0,0)$.\n2. $x^2 - 2a^2 = 0 \\implies x^2 = 2a^2 \\implies x = \\pm\\sqrt{2a^2} = \\pm a\\sqrt{2}$. This gives the two points $(a\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ and $(-a\\sqrt{2}, 0)$.\n\nThus, the complete set of points on the curve where $y$ cannot be locally expressed as a smooth function of $x$ is $\\{(0,0), (a\\sqrt{2}, 0), (-a\\sqrt{2}, 0)\\}$.\nThe point $(0,0)$ is a self-intersection of the lemniscate, and the points $(\\pm a\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ are the points where the tangent to the curve is vertical.\n\nComparing this set with the given options, we find that it matches option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1676657"}]}
