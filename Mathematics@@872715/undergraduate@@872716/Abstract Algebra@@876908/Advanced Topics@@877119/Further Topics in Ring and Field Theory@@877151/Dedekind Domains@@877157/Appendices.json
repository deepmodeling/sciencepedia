Consider the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$, which consists of all complex numbers of the form $a+b\\sqrt{-2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. This ring is an example of a ring of integers in a quadratic number field.\n\nFor any element $\\beta = a+b\\sqrt{-2}$ in this ring, its field norm, denoted $N(\\beta)$, is defined as the product of the element with its complex conjugate.\n\nAn ideal in this ring is a special subset.

The complex conjugate of $\\beta = a+b\\sqrt{-2}$ is $\\bar{\\beta} = a-b\\sqrt{-2}$.\n\nSo, the field norm is:\n$$N(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\bar{\\beta} = (a+b\\sqrt{-2})(a-b\\sqrt{-2})$$\nExpanding this product gives:\n$$N(\\beta) = a^2 - (b\\sqrt{-2})^2 = a^2 - b^2(-2) = a^2 + 2b^2$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to our specific element $\\alpha = 4 + \\sqrt{-2}$.

This exercise guides you through calculating the norm of an ideal defined by two generators, using the fundamental definition of the norm as the size of the quotient ring. By doing so, you will uncover a crucial insight into why certain ideals cannot be generated by a single element, a key feature that makes the arithmetic of Dedekind domains so rich. [@problem_id:1786786]", "problem": "Let $R$ be the ring of numbers of the form $a + b\\sqrt{-11}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. The norm of an element $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{-11}$ is defined as $N(\\alpha) = a^2 + 11b^2$. If an ideal $I$ in this ring is principal and generated by an element $\\alpha$ (denoted $I = (\\alpha)$), then the norm of the ideal, $N(I)$, is equal to $N(\\alpha)$ (since $N(\\alpha)$ is always non-negative).\n\nIn the ring $R$, the principal ideal $(3)$ generated by the integer 3 is known to factor into a product of two distinct prime ideals, $(3) = P_1 P_2$. One of these ideals is given by the generators $P_1 = (3, 1+\\sqrt{-11})$.\n\nIf the ideal $P_1$ were a principal ideal, it would be generated by some element $\\gamma \\in R$. What value must the norm of this hypothetical generator, $N(\\gamma)$, have?

Thus, if we were to assume $P_1 = (\\gamma)$, then it must be that $N(P_1) = N(\\gamma)$. Our task, therefore, reduces to calculating the norm of the ideal $P_1$.\n\nThe norm of an ideal $I$ in the ring of integers $R$ is defined as the number of elements in the quotient ring $R/I$. In this case, we need to determine the size of the quotient ring $R/P_1 = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-11}]/(3, 1+\\sqrt{-11})$.\n\nAn element in this quotient ring is a coset of the form $(a+b\\sqrt{-11}) + P_1$. The ideal $P_1$ is generated by the elements $3$ and $1+\\sqrt{-11}$. This means that within the quotient ring, any element in $P_1$ is equivalent to the zero element. Specifically, multiples of the generators are zero.\nSo, we have the following congruences modulo $P_1$:\n1. $3 \\equiv 0$\n2. $1+\\sqrt{-11} \\equiv 0$\n\nFrom the second relation, we deduce that $\\sqrt{-11} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{P_1}$.\n\nNow, consider an arbitrary element $a+b\\sqrt{-11} \\in R$. We can analyze its corresponding class in the quotient ring by using the congruences. Substituting $\\sqrt{-11}$ with $-1$, we get:\n$$a+b\\sqrt{-11} \\equiv a+b(-1) = a-b \\pmod{P_1}$$\nThis shows that every element in $R$ is congruent to a simple integer modulo $P_1$.\n\nFurthermore, from the first relation, $3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{P_1}$, any integer is congruent to its remainder modulo 3. Since $(3) \\subset P_1$, this congruence holds in the quotient ring $R/P_1$. For any integer $m$, there exists a unique $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ such that $m \\equiv k \\pmod 3$.\n\nCombining these two observations, we can simplify any element of the quotient ring:\n$$a+b\\sqrt{-11} \\equiv a-b \\pmod{P_1}$$\nLet $m = a-b$. Then $m$ is some integer, and $m \\equiv k \\pmod 3$ for some $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. This implies:\n$$a+b\\sqrt{-11} \\equiv k \\pmod{P_1}$$\nThis suggests that there are at most three distinct elements in the quotient ring $R/P_1$, represented by the integers $0, 1, 2$.\n\nTo confirm there are exactly three elements, we must ensure these representatives are distinct in the quotient ring. This is equivalent to showing that $1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{P_1}$ and $2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{P_1}$ and $1 \\not\\equiv 2 \\pmod{P_1}$. If $1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{P_1}$, it means $1 \\in P_1$. An ideal containing $1$ must be the entire ring, $P_1 = R$. However, the problem states that $(3)$ factors into prime ideals $P_1 P_2$. Prime ideals are by definition proper ideals, so $P_1 \\neq R$. We can verify this directly. If $1 \\in (3, 1+\\sqrt{-11})$, then there exist integers $x,y,u,v$ such that:\n$$1 = 3(x+y\\sqrt{-11}) + (1+\\sqrt{-11})(u+v\\sqrt{-11})$$\nExpanding the right hand side:\n$$1 = (3x+3y\\sqrt{-11}) + (u+v\\sqrt{-11}+u\\sqrt{-11}-11v)$$\n$$1 = (3x+u-11v) + (3y+v+u)\\sqrt{-11}$$\nFor this equality to hold, the coefficient of the imaginary part must be zero, and the real part must be one:\n1. $1 = 3x+u-11v$\n2. $0 = 3y+u+v$\nFrom the second equation, $u = -3y-v$. Substituting this into the first equation gives:\n$$1 = 3x + (-3y-v) - 11v = 3x - 3y - 12v = 3(x-y-4v)$$\nThis equation implies that $1$ is an integer multiple of $3$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $1 \\notin P_1$, which means $1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{P_1}$. It follows that the classes represented by $0, 1, 2$ are distinct.\n\nThus, the quotient ring $R/P_1$ has exactly three elements. By definition, the norm of the ideal $P_1$ is the size of this quotient ring.\n$$N(P_1) = |R/P_1| = 3$$\nIf the ideal $P_1$ were principal and generated by an element $\\gamma$, its norm would be equal to the norm of its generator:\n$$N(P_1) = N(\\gamma)$$\nTherefore, the norm of the hypothetical generator $\\gamma$ must be 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1786786"}, {"introduction": "Not every ring of the form $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ is a Dedekind domain, where the powerful theory of unique ideal factorization holds.

A domain is a Dedekind domain if it is Noetherian, integrally closed, and has Krull dimension one. Let $R = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$, where $d$ is a squarefree integer. The field of fractions of $R$ is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$.\n\n1.  **Noetherian Property**: The ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a Noetherian ring. The ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ is a free $\\mathbb{Z}$-module of rank $2$, with basis $\\{1, \\sqrt{d}\\}$. Since $R$ is a finitely generated module over the Noetherian ring $\\mathbb{Z}$, $R$ is itself a Noetherian ring by the Hilbert basis theorem's consequences for modules. This property is always satisfied for $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$.\n\n2.  **Krull Dimension One**: The ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ is an integral extension of $\\mathbb{Z}$, because the element $\\sqrt{d} \\in R$ is a root of the monic polynomial $x^2 - d \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$. A fundamental theorem of dimension theory states that if a ring $S$ is an integral extension of a ring $T$, then $\\dim(S) = \\dim(T)$. The Krull dimension of $\\mathbb{Z}$ is $1$. Therefore, the Krull dimension of $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ is also $1$. This property is always satisfied.\n\n3.  **Integrally Closed Property**: This is the determining property. A domain $A$ is integrally closed if it contains every element of its field of fractions that is integral over $A$. The field of fractions of $R = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$. By definition, the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is the integral closure of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in $K$. An element $\\alpha \\in K$ is integral over $R$ if and only if it is integral over $\\mathbb{Z}$. This is due to the transitivity of integral extensions: since $R$ is integral over $\\mathbb{Z}$, any element integral over $R$ is also integral over $\\mathbb{Z}$. Conversely, any element integral over $\\mathbb{Z}$ is trivially integral over $R$ as $\\mathbb{Z} \\subset R$. Thus, the set of elements of $K$ that are integral over $R$ is precisely $\\mathcal{O}_K$. For $R$ to be integrally closed, it must be equal to its integral closure in $K$. Therefore, $R$ is integrally closed if and only if $R = \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nCombining these three points, the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ is a Dedekind domain if and only if it is integrally closed, which is equivalent to the condition $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}] = \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nNext, we identify when $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}] \\neq \\mathcal{O}_K$. An element $\\alpha = x + y\\sqrt{d}$ with $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ lies in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ if and only if its trace, $Tr_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = 2x$, and norm, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = x^2 - dy^2$, are both integers.\nLet $2x = m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $x^2 - dy^2 = n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $x = m/2$. Substituting this into the norm equation gives $(\\frac{m}{2})^2 - dy^2 = n$, which simplifies to $m^2 - 4dy^2 = 4n$. This means $4dy^2 = m^2 - 4n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet $y = j/k$ where $j, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $k > 0$, and $\\gcd(j,k)=1$. Then $4dj^2/k^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $d$ is squarefree and $\\gcd(j,k)=1$, it must be that $k^2$ divides $4d$. The only square divisors of $4d$ are $1$ and $4$, so $k^2=1$ or $k^2=4$. This implies $k=1$ or $k=2$. So, any algebraic integer in $K$ must have the form $\\alpha = m/2 + (j/2)\\sqrt{d}$ for some integers $m, j$.\nSubstituting $x=m/2$ and $y=j/2$ into the norm condition yields $N(\\alpha) = (m^2 - dj^2)/4 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, which requires $m^2 - dj^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\nWe analyze this congruence:\n- If $j$ is even ($j=2k'$), then $j^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, so $m^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. This implies $m$ is even ($m=2m'$). In this case $x=m'$ and $y=k'$ are integers, so $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$.\n- If $j$ is odd ($j^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$), the congruence becomes $m^2 - d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. For this to have a solution for $m$, $m$ must also be odd ($m^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$), which reduces the condition to $1 - d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, or $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nThus, $\\mathcal{O}_K$ contains elements not in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ (those with $j$ and $m$ odd) if and only if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. If $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$, then $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$.\nTo find a case where $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}] \\neq \\mathcal{O}_K$, we must choose a squarefree integer $d$ such that $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Let us choose $d=5$, which is squarefree and $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. For this choice, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$.\n\nAn explicit algebraic integer in $K$ but not in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{5}]$ can be found by taking $m=1, j=1$. This gives the element $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Its minimal polynomial is $(x-\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})(x-\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}) = x^2-x-1=0$. Since the coefficients are integers, $\\omega$ is an algebraic integer. It does not lie in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{5}]$ because its representation as a $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear combination of $\\{1, \\sqrt{5}\\}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(1) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{5}$, and the coefficients are not in $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]]$ for $d=5$.\nFor $d=5$, the ring $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}]$.\nAs free $\\mathbb{Z}$-modules, we have:\n- $\\mathcal{O}_K$ has a $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis $B_{\\mathcal{O}} = \\{1, \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\}$.\n- $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{5}]$ has a $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis $B_{\\mathbb{Z}} = \\{1, \\sqrt{5}\\}$.\n\nThe index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{5}]]$ is the order of the quotient group $\\mathcal{O}_K / \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{5}]$. This can be computed by finding the determinant of the change-of-basis matrix from $B_{\\mathcal{O}}$ to $B_{\\mathbb{Z}}$.
