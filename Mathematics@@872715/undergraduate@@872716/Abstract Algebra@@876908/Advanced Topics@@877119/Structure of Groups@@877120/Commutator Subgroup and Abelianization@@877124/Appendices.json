The first two relations, $a^n = 1$ and $b^2 = 1$, are kept. We use the new commutativity relation $ab=ba$ to simplify the third relation, $bab = a^{-1}$.\n\nStarting with $bab = a^{-1}$, we can right-multiply by $a$ to get:\n$$baba = a^{-1}a = 1.$$\nNow, we use the commutativity relation $ab = ba$. This allows us to reorder the elements on the left side:\n$$baba = b(ab)a = b(ba)a = (bb)(aa) = b^2 a^2.$$\nSo, the relation $baba=1$ becomes $b^2 a^2 = 1$.\n\nWe already have the relation $b^2 = 1$ from the original presentation. Substituting this into $b^2 a^2 = 1$, we get:\n$$(1) a^2 = 1 \\implies a^2 = 1.$$\nNow our set of relations for the abelianized group is $\\{ a^n = 1, b^2 = 1, a^2=1 \\}$, where the generators $a$ and $b$ commute.\n\nThe relations $a^n = 1$ and $a^2=1$ together imply that the order of the element $a$ must divide both $n$ and $2$. Therefore, the order of $a$ must divide the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $2$, denoted $\\gcd(n,2)$. This means we can replace the relations $a^n=1$ and $a^2=1$ with the single, stronger relation $a^{\\gcd(n,2)} = 1$.\n\nThe simplified presentation for the abelianization is:\n$$G_n^{\\text{ab}} \\cong \\langle a, b \\mid a^{\\gcd(n,2)} = 1, b^2 = 1, ab=ba \\rangle.$$\nSince the generators commute, this group is the direct product of the cyclic groups generated by $a$ and $b$:\n$$G_n^{\\text{ab}} \\cong \\langle a \\mid a^{\\gcd(n,2)}=1 \\rangle \\times \\langle b \\mid b^2=1 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{\\gcd(n,2)} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2.$$\n\nWe now analyze the result based on the parity of $n$.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is odd.\nIf $n$ is odd, then $\\gcd(n,2) = 1$. The relation for $a$ becomes $a^1 = 1$, which means $a$ is the identity element. The group is generated by $b$ alone, subject to the relation $b^2=1$.
