The concept of conjugacy is central to understanding the internal symmetries of any group, and in free groups, there is a beautiful and effective algorithm to determine if two elements are conjugate.

Trimming equal inverse letters at the ends corresponds to conjugation and preserves the conjugacy class.

Its first letter is $a$ and last is $b^{-1}$, with $(b^{-1})^{-1} = b \\neq a$, so $u_{A}$ is cyclically reduced. For $v_{A} = a^{2} b a b^{-1} a^{-1}$, it is reduced and not cyclically reduced because it starts with $a$ and ends with $a^{-1}$. Trimming yields\n$$v_{A} \\sim a b a b^{-1},$$\nwhich equals $u_{A}$. Hence their cyclically reduced forms coincide, so $u_{A}$ and $v_{A}$ are conjugate.\n\nPair B: $u_{B} = a b a^{-1} b^{-1}$ and $v_{B} = b a b^{-1} a^{-1}$ are both reduced and cyclically reduced (their first and last letters are not inverses). List the cyclic permutations of $u_{B}$:\n$$a b a^{-1} b^{-1},\\quad b a^{-1} b^{-1} a,\\quad a^{-1} b^{-1} a b,\\quad b^{-1} a b a^{-1}.$$\nNone equals $v_{B} = b a b^{-1} a^{-1}$.

The cyclic permutations of $u_{C}$ are\n$$a b b a^{-1} b,\\quad b b a^{-1} b a,\\quad b a^{-1} b a b,\\quad a^{-1} b a b b,\\quad b a b b a^{-1}.$$\nWe see $v_{C} = b b a^{-1} b a$, which is the second cyclic permutation of $u_{C}$. Hence they are conjugate.\n\nPair D: $u_{D} = a b a b a^{-1} b^{-1} a^{-1}$ is reduced but not cyclically reduced because it starts with $a$ and ends with $a^{-1}$. Trim:\n$$a b a b a^{-1} b^{-1} a^{-1} \\sim b a b a^{-1} b^{-1} \\sim a b a^{-1} \\sim b.$$\nThus the cyclically reduced form of $u_{D}$ is $b$.
