The two defining relations for the group are:\n(1) $a^{-1}ba = b^2$\n(2) $b^{-1}ab = a^2$\n\nWe begin by manipulating these relations to express one generator in terms of the other. From relation (1), by left-multiplying by $a$, we get:\n$a(a^{-1}ba) = a(b^2)$\n$(aa^{-1})ba = ab^2$\n$ba = ab^2$\n\nFrom relation (2), by left-multiplying by $b$, we get:\n$b(b^{-1}ab) = b(a^2)$\n$(bb^{-1})ab = ba^2$\n$ab = ba^2$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations describing the interaction of $a$ and $b$:\n(3) $ba = ab^2$\n(4) $ab = ba^2$\n\nWe can substitute the expression for $ba$ from (3) into equation (4):\n$ab = (ab^2)a^2$\n$ab = ab^2a^2$\n\nWe can now left-multiply both sides of this equation by $a^{-1}$:\n$a^{-1}(ab) = a^{-1}(ab^2a^2)$\n$b = b^2a^2$\n\nNext, we can left-multiply by $b^{-1}$:\n$b^{-1}b = b^{-1}(b^2a^2)$\n$e = ba^2$\n\nThis important result, $ba^2=e$, implies that $b$ is the inverse of $a^2$.\n$b = (a^2)^{-1} = a^{-2}$\n\nNow that we have expressed $b$ solely in terms of $a$, we can substitute this back into one of the original relations. Let's use relation (1), $a^{-1}ba = b^2$:\n$a^{-1}(a^{-2})a = (a^{-2})^2$\n\nLet's simplify both sides.

We aim to show that there are at most six distinct elements and at least six distinct elements, hence exactly six.\n\nReduction to short alternating words:\n1) Using $a^{2}=e$ and $b^{2}=e$, any word can be freely reduced to an alternating word (i.e., with no $aa$ or $bb$ adjacent).\n2) If an alternating word has length at least 4, it contains a subword $aba$ or $bab$.
