We are looking for its multiplicative inverse, which we will denote as $\\alpha^{-1}$.

Determine the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.", "solution": "Let the given element be $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + i\\sqrt{5}$. Our goal is to find a monic polynomial with rational coefficients of the smallest possible degree that has $\\alpha$ as a root.\n\nFirst, we manipulate the expression for $\\alpha$ to eliminate the radicals. We begin by isolating one of the radical terms.\n$$ \\alpha - \\sqrt{2} = i\\sqrt{5} $$\nNow, we square both sides of the equation to eliminate the imaginary unit and one of the square roots:\n$$ (\\alpha - \\sqrt{2})^{2} = (i\\sqrt{5})^{2} $$\n$$ \\alpha^{2} - 2\\alpha\\sqrt{2} + (\\sqrt{2})^{2} = i^{2}(\\sqrt{5})^{2} $$\n$$ \\alpha^{2} - 2\\alpha\\sqrt{2} + 2 = (-1)(5) $$\n$$ \\alpha^{2} - 2\\alpha\\sqrt{2} + 2 = -5 $$\nNext, we isolate the remaining term containing a radical:\n$$ \\alpha^{2} + 7 = 2\\alpha\\sqrt{2} $$\nTo eliminate the last radical, we square both sides of this new equation:\n$$ (\\alpha^{2} + 7)^{2} = (2\\alpha\\sqrt{2})^{2} $$\n$$ (\\alpha^{2})^{2} + 2(\\alpha^{2})(7) + 7^{2} = 4\\alpha^{2}(2) $$\n$$ \\alpha^{4} + 14\\alpha^{2} + 49 = 8\\alpha^{2} $$\nFinally, we rearrange the terms to form a polynomial equation with $\\alpha$ as a root:\n$$ \\alpha^{4} + 14\\alpha^{2} - 8\\alpha^{2} + 49 = 0 $$\n$$ \\alpha^{4} + 6\\alpha^{2} + 49 = 0 $$\nThis shows that $\\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial $P(x) = x^{4} + 6x^{2} + 49$. The coefficients of this polynomial (1, 6, 49) are all rational numbers, and it is monic (the leading coefficient is 1).\n\nTo confirm that $P(x)$ is the minimal polynomial, we must show that it is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nA polynomial of degree 4 is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if it has a linear factor (corresponding to a rational root) or if it can be factored into a product of two quadratic polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\nFirst, we check for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root $\\frac{p}{q}$ of $P(x)$ must have $p$ as a divisor of the constant term (49) and $q$ as a divisor of the leading coefficient (1). Thus, the possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 7, \\pm 49$.\nLet's test these values:\n$P(x) = x^4 + 6x^2 + 49$. Since all powers of $x$ are even, $P(-x) = (-x)^4 + 6(-x)^2 + 49 = x^4 + 6x^2 + 49 = P(x)$. Thus, we only need to check the positive values.\n$P(1) = 1 + 6 + 49 = 56 \\neq 0$\n$P(7) = 7^4 + 6(7^2) + 49 = 2401 + 6(49) + 49 = 2401 + 294 + 49 = 2744 \\neq 0$\n$P(49) = 49^4 + 6(49^2) + 49 > 0$\nSince there are no rational roots, $P(x)$ has no linear factors with rational coefficients.\n\nNext, we check if $P(x)$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with rational coefficients. Assume such a factorization exists:\n$x^{4} + 6x^{2} + 49 = (x^{2} + ax + b)(x^{2} + cx + d)$\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Expanding the right side gives:\n$x^{4} + (a+c)x^{3} + (d+b+ac)x^{2} + (ad+bc)x + bd$\nBy comparing the coefficients with $x^{4} + 0x^{3} + 6x^{2} + 0x + 49$, we obtain a system of equations:\n1. $a+c = 0 \\implies c = -a$\n2. $ad+bc = 0$\n3. $d+b+ac = 6$\n4. $bd = 49$\n\nSubstitute $c = -a$ into equation (2):\n$ad + b(-a) = 0 \\implies a(d-b) = 0$\nThis implies either $a=0$ or $d=b$.\n\nCase 1: $a=0$.\nIf $a=0$, then from (1), $c=0$. The factorization becomes $(x^2+b)(x^2+d)$.\nThe equations simplify to:\n$d+b=6$\n$bd=49$\nThis means $b$ and $d$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $t^2 - (b+d)t + bd = 0$, which is $t^2 - 6t + 49 = 0$.\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is $\\Delta = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(49) = 36 - 196 = -160$.\nThe roots are $t = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{-160}}{2} = 3 \\pm 2i\\sqrt{10}$.\nSince $b$ and $d$ are not rational numbers, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: $d=b$.\nFrom (4), $b^2 = 49$, which means $b = 7$ or $b = -7$.\nFrom (3), we have $2b - a^2 = 6$ (substituting $d=b$ and $c=-a$).\nIf $b=7$ (and $d=7$), then $2(7) - a^2 = 6 \\implies 14 - a^2 = 6 \\implies a^2 = 8$. This gives $a = \\pm\\sqrt{8} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is not a rational number.\nIf $b=-7$ (and $d=-7$), then $2(-7) - a^2 = 6 \\implies -14 - a^2 = 6 \\implies a^2 = -20$. This has no real solution for $a$, and thus no rational solution.\n\nSince both cases lead to a contradiction, the polynomial $P(x)$ cannot be factored into two quadratic polynomials with rational coefficients.\nTherefore, $P(x) = x^{4} + 6x^{2} + 49$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since it is a monic polynomial with rational coefficients that has $\\alpha$ as a root and is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it is, by definition, the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{x^{4} + 6x^{2} + 49}$$", "id": "1817323"}, {"introduction": "While it is sometimes possible to try and solve for an element directly, abstract algebra often provides more powerful and elegant tools for answering structural questions.
