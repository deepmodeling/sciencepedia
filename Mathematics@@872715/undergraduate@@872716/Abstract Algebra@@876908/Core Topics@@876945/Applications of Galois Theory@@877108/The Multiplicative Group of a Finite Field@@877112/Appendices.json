The group is $\\mathbb{F}_{19}^*$, which consists of the integers $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 18\\}$ under multiplication modulo 19. The order of this group is $|\\mathbb{F}_{19}^*| = 19 - 1 = 18$.\n\nAn element $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{19}^*$ has order 3 if $x^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$ and $x^1 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$. The elements whose order divides 3 are the solutions to the polynomial equation $x^3 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$.\n\nWe can factor the polynomial $x^3 - 1$ as:\n$$x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$$\nSo, the solutions to $x^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$ are the solutions to $(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$. This means solutions are found by solving $x - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$ or $x^2 + x + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$.\n\nThe solution to $x - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$ is $x = 1$. The element $1$ has order 1, as $1^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$.\n\nThe elements of order 3 must therefore be the solutions to the other factor, the quadratic equation:\n$$x^2 + x + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$$\nLet the roots of this equation be $r_1$ and $r_2$. These are the two elements of order 3 in $\\mathbb{F}_{19}^*$. The problem asks for the sum of these elements, which is $r_1 + r_2$.\n\nWe can find this sum without explicitly finding the roots by using Vieta's formulas. For a general quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is given by the expression $-b/a$.\n\nFor our equation, $x^2 + x + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$, we have coefficients $a=1$, $b=1$, and $c=1$.\nApplying Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is:\n$$r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{b}{a} = -\\frac{1}{1} = -1$$\nThe calculation is performed in $\\mathbb{F}_{19}$.
