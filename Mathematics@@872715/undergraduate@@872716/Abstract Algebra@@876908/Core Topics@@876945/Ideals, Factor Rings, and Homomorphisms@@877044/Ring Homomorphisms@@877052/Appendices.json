This means $\\phi(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_8$. This is the zero homomorphism. The problem asks for non-zero homomorphisms, so we do not count this one.\n\nCase 2: $\\phi(1) = 1$.\nThe candidate for the homomorphism is $\\phi(x) = x \\cdot \\phi(1) = x \\cdot 1 = x \\pmod 4$.\nWe must verify that this map is a well-defined ring homomorphism.\nFirst, we check if it's well-defined. A map from $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ is well-defined if elements that are congruent modulo 8 map to the same element in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$. Let $k_1, k_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ be two integers such that $k_1 \\equiv k_2 \\pmod 8$. This means $k_1 - k_2 = 8m$ for some integer $m$. Since $8m = 4(2m)$, it follows that $k_1 - k_2$ is a multiple of 4, so $k_1 \\equiv k_2 \\pmod 4$. Thus, $\\phi(k_1) = k_1 \\pmod 4$ is equal to $k_2 \\pmod 4 = \\phi(k_2)$. The map is well-defined.\nSecond, we check the homomorphism properties. Let $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_8$.\n- Additive property: $\\phi(x+y) = (x+y) \\pmod 4$. Also, $\\phi(x) + \\phi(y) = (x \\pmod 4) + (y \\pmod 4) = (x+y) \\pmod 4$. The property holds.\n- Multiplicative property: $\\phi(x \\cdot y) = (x \\cdot y) \\pmod 4$. Also, $\\phi(x) \\cdot \\phi(y) = (x \\pmod 4) \\cdot (y \\pmod 4) = (x \\cdot y) \\pmod 4$. The property holds.\nThus, $\\phi(x) = x \\pmod 4$ is a valid ring homomorphism.\n\nFinally, we check if this homomorphism is non-zero. Since $\\phi(1) = 1 \\pmod 4 = 1$, and $1$ is not the zero element in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$, this is a non-zero homomorphism.\n\nWe have exhausted all possibilities for $\\phi(1)$, finding one that corresponds to the zero homomorphism and one that corresponds to a non-zero homomorphism.
