It has a special property: every ideal can be generated by a single integer, making it a Principal Ideal Domain (PID). This exercise provides a fundamental hands-on task: to take an ideal defined by two integers and find its single, principal generator. This practice directly connects the abstract algebraic concept of an ideal to the familiar, computational tool of the Euclidean algorithm, reinforcing the idea that the generator is the greatest common divisor of the original numbers [@problem_id:1801748].", "problem": "In the ring of integers, $(\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\cdot)$, an ideal is a non-empty subset $I$ of $\\mathbb{Z}$ that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of $\\mathbb{Z}$.
