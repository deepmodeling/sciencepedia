Therefore, the number of ideals in $R/I$ equals the number of ideals of $R$ containing $(10)$, i.e., the number of ideal divisors of $(10)$.\n\nSince $R$ is a principal ideal domain, every ideal is principal and unique factorization into prime ideals corresponds to factorization into Gaussian primes. We factor $(10)$ in $R$.\n\nFirst, factor $2$ and $5$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Using $N(a+bi)=a^{2}+b^{2}$ and multiplicativity of the norm:\n- $(1+i)^{2}=1+2i+i^{2}=2i$, hence $2=-i(1+i)^{2}$, so as ideals $(2)=(1+i)^{2}$.\n- $5=(2+i)(2-i)$, and $N(2\\pm i)=5$ is prime in $\\mathbb{Z}$, so $2\\pm i$ are Gaussian primes and the principal ideals $(2+i)$ and $(2-i)$ are distinct prime ideals.\n\nThus, as an ideal factorization,\n$$\n(10)=(2)(5)=(1+i)^{2}(2+i)(2-i).\n$$\nThe three prime ideals $(1+i)$, $(2+i)$, and $(2-i)$ are pairwise coprime: any common nonunit divisor would have norm dividing both $2$ and $5$, which is impossible.
