A zero-divisor is a non-zero element $a$ for which there exists another non-zero element $b$ such that their product $ab$ is the zero element of the ring.\n\nThe elements of the quotient ring $R$ are cosets of the form $p(x) + I$, where $p(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $I = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$. We will denote the coset $p(x) + I$ by $[p(x)]$.\nThe zero element in $R$ is the coset $0 + I = I = [0]$. An element $[p(x)]$ is the zero element if and only if $p(x) \\in I$, which means $p(x)$ is a multiple of $x^2$.\nThe multiplication of two elements $[p(x)]$ and $[q(x)]$ in $R$ is defined as $[p(x)][q(x)] = [p(x)q(x)]$.\n\nLet's test for zero-divisors. Consider the element corresponding to the polynomial $x$. Let $a = [x] = x + I$.\nFirst, we verify if $a$ is a non-zero element in $R$. The element $a=[x]$ is zero if and only if $x \\in I = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$. This would mean that $x = q(x) \\cdot x^2$ for some polynomial $q(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$. This is impossible, as the degree of the polynomial on the right side would be at least 2, while the degree of $x$ is 1. Thus, $x \\notin \\langle x^2 \\rangle$, which means $a = [x]$ is a non-zero element of $R$.\n\nNext, let's compute the product of $a$ with itself:\n$$a^2 = a \\cdot a = [x] \\cdot [x] = [x \\cdot x] = [x^2]$$\nNow we check if $[x^2]$ is the zero element in $R$. The element $[x^2]$ is zero if $x^2 \\in I = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$. By the definition of the ideal generated by $x^2$, $x^2$ is indeed an element of $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (since $x^2 = 1 \\cdot x^2$ and $1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$). Therefore, $[x^2] = [0]$.\n\nWe have found a non-zero element $a = [x]$ such that $a^2 = a \\cdot a = [0]$. This means that $a$ is a zero-divisor. The existence of even one zero-divisor is sufficient to conclude that the ring $R$ is not an integral domain. An element like $a$ which is non-zero but has a power that is zero is called a nilpotent element. Every non-zero nilpotent element is a zero-divisor.\n\nNow, let's analyze why the other options are incorrect.\n- **A)** The argument that $R$ is an integral domain because $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is an integral domain is fallacious. A quotient of an integral domain is not necessarily an integral domain. A classic counterexample is $\\mathbb{Z}_{6} = \\mathbb{Z}/\\langle 6 \\rangle$. $\\mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain, but in $\\mathbb{Z}_{6}$, we have $[2][3] = [6] = [0]$, so it has zero-divisors.\n- **B)** This option uses the theorem that a quotient ring $S/P$ is an integral domain if and only if the ideal $P$ is a prime ideal. While the theorem is correct, the premise that $I = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ is a prime ideal is false. An ideal $P$ is prime if for any $f,g$ in the ring, $fg \\in P$ implies $f \\in P$ or $g \\in P$. We saw that $x \\cdot x = x^2 \\in \\langle x^2 \\rangle$. If $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ were prime, this would imply $x \\in \\langle x^2 \\rangle$. But we have already shown this is false. So, $I = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ is not a prime ideal.\n- **D)** This option claims the ring is not commutative. However, the multiplication in $R$ is inherited from the multiplication of polynomials in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$, which is commutative. For any $[f(x)], [g(x)] \\in R$, we have $[f(x)][g(x)] = [f(x)g(x)] = [g(x)f(x)] = [g(x)][f(x)]$. So, $R$ is a commutative ring.\n- **E)** This option correctly states that any element can be represented as $a+bx+I$, but incorrectly concludes that the structure has no zero-divisors. As we have shown, $[x]$ is a zero-divisor.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that $R$ is not an integral domain, and the reason is the existence of non-zero elements whose square is zero, such as $[x]$.

We must determine whether $(R,+,\\cdot)$ is an integral domain.\n\nFirst, we identify the multiplicative identity. For any $(a,b)\\in R$, compute\n$$(a,b)\\cdot(1,0)=(a\\cdot 1-3b\\cdot 0,a\\cdot 0+b\\cdot 1)=(a,b),$$\nand similarly $(1,0)\\cdot(a,b)=(a,b)$ by commutativity of rational multiplication. Hence $(1,0)$ is a multiplicative identity, so option B is false.\n\nNext, verify commutativity of multiplication. For $(a,b),(c,d)\\in R$,\n$$(a,b)\\cdot(c,d)=(ac-3bd,ad+bc),\\quad (c,d)\\cdot(a,b)=(ca-3db,cb+da).$$\nSince multiplication in $\\mathbb{Q}$ is commutative, we have $ac=ca$, $bd=db$, and $ad+bc=cb+da$, so the two products coincide. Thus multiplication is commutative, so option C is false.\n\nTo decide whether there are zero divisors or whether every nonzero element is invertible, compute a norm-like expression. For any $(a,b)\\in R$,\n$$(a,b)\\cdot(a,-b)=(a^{2}-3b(-b),a(-b)+ba)=(a^{2}+3b^{2},0).$$\nIf $(a,b)\\neq (0,0)$, then $a^{2}+3b^{2}\\neq 0$. Indeed, if $b\\neq 0$, then $(a/b)^{2}=-3$, which is impossible in $\\mathbb{Q}$; if $b=0$, then $a^{2}=0$ implies $a=0$. Therefore $a^{2}+3b^{2}\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\setminus\\{0\\}$.\n\nHence every nonzero $(a,b)$ has a multiplicative inverse explicitly given by $(a,b)^{-1}=\\left(\\frac{a}{a^{2}+3b^{2}},\\frac{-b}{a^{2}+3b^{2}}\\right)$, since $(a,b)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{a}{a^{2}+3b^{2}},\\frac{-b}{a^{2}+3b^{2}}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{a^{2}+3b^{2}}{a^{2}+3b^{2}},\\frac{-ab+ab}{a^{2}+3b^{2}}\\right)=(1,0)$. Because the denominators are nonzero rationals, the inverse lies in $R$. Therefore every nonzero element is invertible, so $R$ is a field.
