The construction proceeds as follows:\n\nLet $D$ be an integral domain.\n1. Define a set $S$ of pairs of elements from $D$: $S = \\{(a, b) \\mid a, b \\in D, b \\neq 0\\}$.\n2. Define a relation $\\sim$ on the set $S$ by declaring $(a, b) \\sim (c, d)$ if and only if $ad = bc$. This can be shown to be an equivalence relation.\n3. The set of all equivalence classes, denoted $F = S/\\sim$, forms a field, called the field of quotients of $D$.\n\nNow, consider the trivial ring $R = \\{0\\}$, which consists of only the additive identity. Although this ring is commutative and has a multiplicative identity (which is $0$), it is not an integral domain because it violates the axiom that the multiplicative identity must be different from the additive identity ($1 \\neq 0$).\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the fundamental breakdown point when attempting to apply the construction procedure for the field of quotients to the trivial ring $R = \\{0\\}$?\n\nA.
