A fundamental property of PIDs is that for any two elements $a, b \\in R$, the intersection of the principal ideals they generate, $(a) \\cap (b)$, is also a principal ideal generated by the least common multiple (lcm) of $a$ and $b$. That is, $(a) \\cap (b) = (\\text{lcm}(a,b))$.\n\nIn this problem, the PID is the ring of polynomials with rational coefficients, $R = \\mathbb{Q}[x]$. We are given two ideals, $I = (p(x))$ and $J = (q(x))$, where the generators are $p(x) = x^2 - 4$ and $q(x) = x^2 + x - 6$.\n\nAccording to the property mentioned above, the intersection $I \\cap J$ is the principal ideal generated by the least common multiple of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$.\n$$I \\cap J = (p(x)) \\cap (q(x)) = (\\text{lcm}(p(x), q(x)))$$\nOur task is to find this lcm and ensure it is a monic polynomial. In a polynomial ring over a field like $\\mathbb{Q}$, the generator of a principal ideal is unique up to multiplication by a non-zero constant (a unit). Requiring the generator to be monic makes it unique.\n\nTo find the lcm of two polynomials, it is helpful to first find their prime factorizations. In $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, irreducible polynomials act as prime elements.\n\nFirst, we factor the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 - 4$. This is a difference of squares:\n$$p(x) = x^2 - 2^2 = (x - 2)(x + 2)$$\n\nNext, we factor the polynomial $q(x) = x^2 + x - 6$. We look for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add to 1. These numbers are 3 and -2.\n$$q(x) = (x + 3)(x - 2)$$\n\nNow we have the factorizations:\n$p(x) = (x - 2)(x + 2)$\n$q(x) = (x - 2)(x + 3)$\n\nThe least common multiple is found by taking the product of the highest powers of all distinct irreducible factors present in the factorizations of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. The distinct factors are $(x-2)$, $(x+2)$, and $(x+3)$. The highest power for each of these factors in either factorization is 1.\n\nTherefore, the lcm is:\n$$\\text{lcm}(p(x), q(x)) = (x-2)^{1} (x+2)^{1} (x+3)^{1}$$\n\nNow, we expand this expression to find the polynomial generator:\n$$\\text{lcm}(p(x), q(x)) = ((x-2)(x+2))(x+3)$$\n$$= (x^2 - 4)(x+3)$$\n$$= x^2(x+3) - 4(x+3)$$\n$$= x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12$$\n\nThe resulting polynomial, $x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12$, is the generator of the ideal $I \\cap J$. We must check if it is monic. A polynomial is monic if its leading coefficient (the coefficient of the highest-degree term) is 1. The leading term is $x^3$, and its coefficient is 1.

This practice [@problem_id:1801043] examines the ring $R = k[x^2, x^3]$, a classic example of an integral domain that is *not* a Unique Factorization Domain. By finding an element with two fundamentally different factorizations into irreducibles, you will gain a deeper appreciation for why UFDs are a special class of rings and why the implication 'Integral Domain $\\implies$ UFD' does not hold.", "problem": "Let $k$ be a field.

It can be verified that this set $R$ forms a subring of $k[x]$.\n\nFor context, recall the following definitions for a commutative ring with identity. An integral domain is a ring with no zero divisors. A Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) is an integral domain where every non-zero, non-unit element has a unique factorization into irreducible elements (up to order and associates). A Principal Ideal Domain (PID) is an integral domain where every ideal is generated by a single element. A Euclidean Domain (ED) is an integral domain that admits a Euclidean function.

First, $R$ is a subring of $k[x]$: for $p(x),q(x)\\in R$, the coefficient of $x$ in $p(x)+q(x)$ is $0+0=0$, and the coefficient of $x$ in $p(x)q(x)$ equals the sum of products of coefficients whose degrees add to $1$, namely the constant term of one times the linear coefficient of the other plus the linear coefficient of one times the constant term of the other; both linear coefficients are zero, so the result is $0$. Hence $R$ is closed under addition and multiplication and contains $1$, so it is a unital subring.\n\nSince $k[x]$ is an integral domain and $R$ is a subring of $k[x]$ with the same multiplication, $R$ has no zero divisors: if $a,b\\in R$ and $ab=0$ in $R$, then $ab=0$ in $k[x]$, and since $k[x]$ is a domain, either $a=0$ or $b=0$. Therefore $R$ is an integral domain.\n\nNext, we show that $R = k[x^2, x^3]$. An element of $R$ is a polynomial whose $x^1$ term is absent. Any monomial $x^n$ with $n \\geq 2$ can be generated by $x^2$ and $x^3$: if $n$ is even, $x^n=(x^2)^{n/2}$; if $n \\geq 3$ is odd, then $n-3 \\geq 0$ is even, so $x^n = x^3(x^2)^{(n-3)/2}$. Since $R$ consists of linear combinations of $1$ and such $x^n$ ($n \\geq 2$), we have $R \\subseteq k[x^2, x^3]$. Conversely, any element of $k[x^2, x^3]$ is a $k$-linear combination of monomials of the form $x^{2a+3b}$ for non-negative integers $a, b$. Since the equation $2a+3b=1$ has no solution in non-negative integers, such a polynomial has no $x^1$ term. Thus $k[x^2, x^3] \\subseteq R$. Therefore, $R = k[x^2, x^3]$.\n\nThe units of $R$ are exactly the nonzero constants from $k$, as in $k[x]$, because any nonconstant polynomial has positive degree and cannot have a multiplicative inverse that is a polynomial. In $R$, any non-unit must have degree at least $2$ because the $x^1$-term is forbidden. Hence if $f,g\\in R$ are non-units, then $\\deg f\\geq 2$ and $\\deg g\\geq 2$, which implies\n$$\n\\deg(fg)=\\deg f+\\deg g\\geq 4.\n$$\nIt follows that $x^2$ is irreducible in $R$: if $x^2=fg$ with $f,g\\in R$, then at least one of $f$ or $g$ must be a unit, since otherwise $\\deg(fg)\\geq 4$ contradicts $\\deg x^2=2$. The same argument shows $x^3$ is irreducible, because any factorization into non-units would force $\\deg(fg)\\geq 4\\neq 3$.\n\nNow consider $x^6 \\in R$. It has two factorizations in $R$:\n$$\nx^6=(x^2)^3=(x^3)^2.\n$$\nBoth $x^2$ and $x^3$ are irreducible and are not associates (units are constants, and no constant multiplies $x^2$ to $x^3$). Hence these are distinct factorizations into irreducibles. Therefore, $R$ is not a Unique Factorization Domain.\n\nWe have shown $R$ is an integral domain but not a UFD. By the chain of implications $\\text{ED}\\implies\\text{PID}\\implies\\text{UFD}\\implies\\text{Integral Domain}$, $R$ cannot be a PID or an ED.
