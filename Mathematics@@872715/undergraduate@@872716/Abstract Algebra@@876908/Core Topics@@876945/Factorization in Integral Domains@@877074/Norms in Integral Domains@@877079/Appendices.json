We are given that $N(y) = -3$. Therefore, we need to find non-zero integers $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the Diophantine equation:\n$$a^2 - 7b^2 = -3$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $a^2$:\n$$a^2 = 7b^2 - 3$$\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ must be integers, $a^2$ must be a perfect square. We are also given that $b$ must be a non-zero integer. We can test small non-zero integer values for $b$ and see if $7b^2 - 3$ results in a perfect square.\n\nLet's start by testing positive integer values for $b$.\n\nCase 1: $b = 1$.\nSubstituting $b=1$ into the equation for $a^2$:\n$$a^2 = 7(1)^2 - 3$$\n$$a^2 = 7 - 3$$\n$$a^2 = 4$$\nThis gives $a = \\pm 2$.
