This first exercise invites you to consider the rotational symmetries of a cube, a tangible and highly symmetric setting. By analyzing how these rotations act on the cube's edges, you will use the theorem to determine how many symmetries fix a particular edge, providing a concrete intuition for the concept of a stabilizer [@problem_id:1837417].", "problem": "Consider a solid cube and its group of rotational symmetries, denoted by $G$. This group naturally acts on the set of the cube's twelve edges, which we will call $X$. For an arbitrarily chosen edge $e \\in X$, determine the total number of rotations in $G$ that leave the edge $e$ occupying its original position. A rotation is considered to leave an edge in its position even if it interchanges the edge's two endpoint vertices.", "solution": "Let $G$ be the group of rotational symmetries of a solid cube, and let $X$ be the set of its twelve edges. The problem asks for the number of rotations that leave a specific edge $e \\in X$ in its original location. In the language of group theory, this quantity is the order of the stabilizer of the edge $e$, denoted $|\\text{Stab}_G(e)|$.\n\nTo find this value, we can employ the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem. For any group action of $G$ on a set $X$, and for any element $x \\in X$, the theorem states:\n$$|G| = |\\text{Orb}_G(x)| \\cdot |\\text{Stab}_G(x)|$$\nHere, $\\text{Orb}_G(x)$ is the orbit of $x$, which is the set of all elements in $X$ to which $x$ can be sent by some element of $G$.\n\nFirst, we determine the order of the group $G$, $|G|$. The group $G$ consists of all rotational symmetries of a cube. We can count these by considering where a specific face can be mapped. A cube has 6 faces. We can rotate the cube to place any of these 6 faces in a chosen orientation (e.g., facing upwards). Once a face is fixed in this position, there are still 4 possible rotations (by 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees) about the axis passing through the center of that face and the center of the opposite face. Therefore, the total number of rotational symmetries is $|G| = 6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n\nNext, we determine the size of the orbit of a chosen edge $e$, denoted $|\\text{Orb}_G(e)|$. The orbit of $e$ is the set of all edges that $e$ can be moved to by a rotation in $G$. Through various rotations, it is possible to move any given edge of the cube to the position of any other edge. For instance, a rotation of 90 degrees about an axis through the center of a face will move an edge on that face to the position of an adjacent edge on the same face. A rotation of 180 degrees about an axis passing through the midpoints of opposite edges will move an edge to its opposite. Since any edge can be mapped to any other edge, the group action is transitive on the set of edges. This means the orbit of any edge is the entire set $X$. The cube has 12 edges, so $|\\text{Orb}_G(e)| = |X| = 12$.\n\nNow we can apply the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem:\n$$|G| = |\\text{Orb}_G(e)| \\cdot |\\text{Stab}_G(e)|$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$24 = 12 \\cdot |\\text{Stab}_G(e)|$$\n\nSolving for the size of the stabilizer, we find:\n$$|\\text{Stab}_G(e)| = \\frac{24}{12} = 2$$\n\nThus, there are 2 rotations that leave a specific edge in its original position. These two rotations are:\n1. The identity rotation, which leaves every point of the cube fixed.\n2. A 180-degree rotation about the axis passing through the midpoint of the chosen edge and the midpoint of the edge on the opposite side of the cube. This rotation swaps the endpoints of the edge but leaves the edge as a whole in the same location.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1837417"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simply counting elements, this practice explores the deeper algebraic nature of a stabilizer.

Using $sr^3 = r^{-3}s = r^3s$, the element $r^3s$ is also a reflection; geometrically it is the reflection across the axis perpendicular to the line $v_1v_4$, which swaps $v_1$ and $v_4$, hence $r^3s \\cdot p_1 = p_1$.
