One fundamental property is the distribution of element orders.

Also $(-i)^{2}=(-1)^{2}i^{2}=i^{2}=-1$, hence $(-i)$ has order $4$, and similarly for $-j$ and $-k$. The element $-1$ has order $2$ since $(-1)^{2}=1$ and $-1\\neq 1$, and there is no other element of order $2$ because for $x\\in\\{\\pm i,\\pm j,\\pm k\\}$ we have $x^{2}=-1\\neq 1$.
