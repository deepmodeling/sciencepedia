The set $S$ is the union of all conjugacy classes of the elements of $H$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the elements of the subgroup $H$.\n$H$ is generated by $y$ and $x^2$. The orders of the generators are $o(y)=2$ and $o(x^2)=2$ since $(x^2)^2 = x^4 = 1$. To list the elements of $H$, we need to check if the generators commute.\nLet's compute the product $yx^2$ and $x^2y$.\nThe defining relation $yx=x^{-1}y$ can be used to move $y$ past powers of $x$. Note that $x^{-1} = x^3$ since $x^4=1$.\n$yx^2 = (yx)x = (x^{-1}y)x = x^{-1}(yx) = x^{-1}(x^{-1}y) = x^{-2}y$.\nSince $x^4=1$, $x^{-2} = x^2$.\nSo, $yx^2 = x^2y$.\nSince the generators of $H$ commute, $H$ is an abelian subgroup. The elements of $H$ are formed by products of its generators.\n$H = \\{1, y, x^2, x^2y\\}$.\nThe order of $H$ is $|H|=4$.\n\nNext, we analyze the structure of the set $S$. The set $S$ is the union of the conjugacy classes of the elements in $H$:\n$S = \\bigcup_{h \\in H} Cl_G(h)$, where $Cl_G(h) = \\{k h k^{-1} \\mid k \\in G\\}$.\nA key theorem in group theory states that a subgroup $H$ is normal in $G$ if and only if $H$ is a union of conjugacy classes of $G$. This is equivalent to the condition that for any $h \\in H$, its entire conjugacy class $Cl_G(h)$ is contained in $H$. If this condition holds, then $S = \\bigcup_{h \\in H} Cl_G(h) \\subseteq H$. Also, since every element $h \\in H$ is in its own conjugacy class (because $h=1h1^{-1}$), we have $H \\subseteq S$. Therefore, if $H$ is a normal subgroup, then $S=H$.\n\nLet's check if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. A subgroup $H$ is normal if for every $g \\in G$, $gHg^{-1}=H$. It is sufficient to check this condition for the generators of $G$, which are $x$ and $y$. We need to verify that the conjugates of the generators of $H$ (which are $y$ and $x^2$) by the generators of $G$ are still in $H$.\n\n1.  Conjugation by $y$:\n    -   Conjugate of $y$: $y y y^{-1} = y y y = y^3 = y \\in H$. (Since $y^2=1$, $y^{-1}=y$).\n    -   Conjugate of $x^2$: $y x^2 y^{-1} = y x^2 y$. As we showed earlier, $yx^2=x^2y$. So, $y x^2 y = (x^2y)y = x^2 y^2 = x^2(1) = x^2 \\in H$.\n    So, $yHy^{-1} = H$.\n\n2.  Conjugation by $x$:\n    -   Conjugate of $x^2$: $x x^2 x^{-1} = x^3 x^{-1} = x^2 \\in H$.\n    -   Conjugate of $y$: $x y x^{-1}$. We can use the relation $yx = x^{-1}y$, which implies $xy = yx^{-1}$.\n        $x y x^{-1} = (y x^{-1}) x^{-1} = y x^{-2} = y x^2$.\n        We found earlier that $yx^2 = x^2y$. The element $x^2y$ is in $H$ by definition of $H$.\n        Thus, $x y x^{-1} = yx^2 = x^2y \\in H$.\n    So, $xHx^{-1} = H$.\n\nSince conjugation by the generators of $G$ maps the generators of $H$ to elements within $H$, it follows that $gHg^{-1} \\subseteq H$ for all $g \\in G$. Since conjugation is an isomorphism, $|gHg^{-1}|=|H|$, which implies $gHg^{-1} = H$ for all $g \\in G$. Therefore, $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\nBecause $H$ is a normal subgroup, the set $S$ of all elements conjugate to an element of $H$ is exactly the set $H$ itself. The problem asks for the number of distinct elements in $S$.\nTherefore, $|S| = |H|$.\nFrom our initial analysis, we found that $H = \\{1, x^2, y, x^2y\\}$, so its size is 4.\n\nThe number of distinct elements in the set $S$ is 4.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1810035"}, {"introduction": "Identifying all normal subgroups is key to understanding a group's structure and its possible quotient groups.
