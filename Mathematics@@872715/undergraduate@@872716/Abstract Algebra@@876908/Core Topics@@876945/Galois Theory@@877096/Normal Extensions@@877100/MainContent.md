## Introduction
In the study of abstract algebra, the relationship between a field and its extensions is a central theme, particularly concerning the [roots of polynomials](@entry_id:154615). A fundamental question arises: if a field extension contains one root of a polynomial, does it necessarily contain all of its 'sibling' roots? The answer to this question is not always yes, and this gap in algebraic completeness leads to one of the most important concepts in field theory: the **[normal extension](@entry_id:155744)**. Normal extensions are extensions that are 'closed' with respect to the [roots of polynomials](@entry_id:154615), providing the stable and predictable environment necessary for the powerful machinery of Galois theory. This article serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding this critical concept. In the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will delve into the formal definitions of normality, exploring its characterization through [splitting fields](@entry_id:151552) and field [embeddings](@entry_id:158103). Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will see how these principles are applied to solve problems in number theory, geometry, and the theory of equations. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will provide concrete problems to reinforce these theoretical foundations.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the study of [field theory](@entry_id:155241), we are often concerned with the relationship between a base field $F$ and an extension field $K$. A central question arises: when does an extension field $K$ contain "enough" elements relative to $F$ to be considered algebraically well-behaved? Specifically, if we find a root of a polynomial from $F[x]$ inside $K$, can we be assured that all of that polynomial's other roots are also present in $K$? This very question leads to the fundamental concept of a **[normal extension](@entry_id:155744)**.

### The Core Principle: A Complete Set of Conjugates

The defining characteristic of a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744) lies in its self-contained nature with respect to [polynomial roots](@entry_id:150265). We formalize this with a primary definition:

An algebraic [field extension](@entry_id:150367) $K/F$ is said to be a **[normal extension](@entry_id:155744)** if every [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) in $F[x]$ that has at least one root in $K$ splits completely into linear factors in $K[x]$.

This means that if an [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) $p(x)$ with coefficients in $F$ "sends" one root into $K$, normality guarantees that $K$ is rich enough to contain the entire family of its roots. These roots are known as the **conjugates** of one another over $F$.

To make this tangible, let us consider the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})/\mathbb{Q}$ [@problem_id:1809725]. The element $\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ is a root of the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 - 2$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. Its roots are $\sqrt{2}$ and $-\sqrt{2}$. Since $-\sqrt{2}$ is also an element of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $p(x)$ splits completely in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. In fact, any element $a+b\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ has a [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) of degree 1 or 2, whose roots will also lie in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. Thus, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})/\mathbb{Q}$ is a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744).

Now, consider a contrasting case: the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})/\mathbb{Q}$ [@problem_id:1809725]. The element $\alpha = \sqrt[3]{2}$ belongs to this field. Its [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $p(x) = x^3 - 2$, which is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion. The three roots of this polynomial in the complex numbers are $\sqrt[3]{2}$, $\sqrt[3]{2}\omega$, and $\sqrt[3]{2}\omega^2$, where $\omega = \exp(2\pi i/3)$ is a primitive cube root of unity. The field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ is a subfield of the real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$, because it is generated by a real number. However, the other two roots, $\sqrt[3]{2}\omega$ and $\sqrt[3]{2}\omega^2$, are not real numbers. Consequently, they cannot be elements of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$. Since the [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) $x^3-2$ has one root in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ but does not split completely, we conclude that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})/\mathbb{Q}$ is **not** a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744) [@problem_id:1809724] [@problem_id:1809719]. This classic example underscores that simply adjoining one root of an [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) is often insufficient to achieve normality.

The property of normality has powerful implications. Suppose we are told that an extension $K/F$ is normal. If we are given an [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) $p(x) \in F[x]$ and discover that one of its roots, say $\alpha_1$, lies in $K$, we can immediately conclude that all other roots of $p(x)$ must also reside in $K$. For instance, consider the extension $K = \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_5)$ over $F = \mathbb{Q}$, where $\zeta_5 = \exp(2\pi i/5)$ is a primitive fifth root of unity. This is a known [normal extension](@entry_id:155744) (as are all [cyclotomic extensions](@entry_id:155116)). Let's examine the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 + x - 1$, which is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. One root is $\alpha_1 = \zeta_5 + \zeta_5^4$, an element confirmed to be in $K$. Because $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is normal, the other root, $\alpha_2$, must also be in $K$. Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = -1$. We can solve for $\alpha_2 = -1 - \alpha_1 = -1 - (\zeta_5 + \zeta_5^4)$. Using the identity $1 + \zeta_5 + \zeta_5^2 + \zeta_5^3 + \zeta_5^4 = 0$, we find that $-1 = \zeta_5 + \zeta_5^2 + \zeta_5^3 + \zeta_5^4$. Substituting this gives $\alpha_2 = (\zeta_5 + \zeta_5^2 + \zeta_5^3 + \zeta_5^4) - (\zeta_5 + \zeta_5^4) = \zeta_5^2 + \zeta_5^3$. This demonstrates how normality acts as a guarantee of closure under conjugation [@problem_id:1809750].

### Normality as a Splitting Field

The definition of normality can be recast into an equivalent, and often more practical, characterization involving the idea of a **[splitting field](@entry_id:156669)**. The [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of a polynomial $p(x) \in F[x]$ is the smallest [field extension](@entry_id:150367) of $F$ that contains all the roots of $p(x)$.

A finite extension $K/F$ is normal if and only if $K$ is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of some polynomial in $F[x]$.

This perspective provides a constructive method for identifying and building normal extensions. If we can show that a field $K$ is precisely the field needed to contain all the roots of some polynomial from $F[x]$, then $K/F$ must be normal.

Let's test this criterion on several examples [@problem_id:1809739] [@problem_id:1809721]:
-   Is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, i)/\mathbb{Q}$ normal? Yes. This field contains $\sqrt{3}$, $-\sqrt{3}$, $i$, and $-i$. These are precisely the roots of the polynomial $p(x) = (x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 1) = x^4 - 2x^2 - 3 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. Since $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, i)$ is the smallest field containing these roots, it is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of $p(x)$ and is therefore a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744). A similar argument applies to any biquadratic extension like $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{7})$, which is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of $(x^2-3)(x^2-7)$.

-   Is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{5})/\mathbb{Q}$ normal? No. The minimal polynomial of $\sqrt[4]{5}$ is $x^4-5$. Its roots are $\pm \sqrt[4]{5}$ and $\pm i\sqrt[4]{5}$. The field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{5})$ is a subfield of $\mathbb{R}$ and does not contain the non-real roots $\pm i\sqrt[4]{5}$. Therefore, it is not the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of $x^4-5$ and is not a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744).

-   Is the extension $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}$ normal? Yes. Any element $z \in \mathbb{C}$ is a root of a polynomial with real coefficients; for instance, $z$ is a root of $(x-z)(x-\bar{z}) = x^2 - (z+\bar{z})x + z\bar{z} \in \mathbb{R}[x]$. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that any polynomial in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ splits completely over $\mathbb{C}$. Thus, $\mathbb{C}$ is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of any polynomial in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ that has a non-real root. For a simple example, $\mathbb{C}$ is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of $x^2+1$ over $\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}$ is a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744) [@problem_id:1809725].

### Characterizing Normality through Embeddings

A third, more abstract perspective on normality is provided through the lens of field [embeddings](@entry_id:158103). Let $\bar{F}$ be an [algebraic closure](@entry_id:151964) of $F$. An $F$-embedding of an extension $K$ into $\bar{F}$ is a [field homomorphism](@entry_id:155269) $\sigma: K \to \bar{F}$ that fixes every element of $F$ (i.e., $\sigma(a) = a$ for all $a \in F$).

An extension $K/F$ is normal if and only if for every $F$-embedding $\sigma: K \to \bar{F}$, the image of $K$ is $K$ itself; that is, $\sigma(K) = K$.

Such embeddings map roots of a polynomial in $F[x]$ to other roots of the same polynomial. If $K=F(\alpha)$, any $F$-embedding $\sigma$ is determined by its action on $\alpha$, and $\sigma(\alpha)$ must be a conjugate of $\alpha$. If $K/F$ is normal, all conjugates of $\alpha$ must lie in $K$. This forces $\sigma(\alpha)$ to be in $K$, and since $\sigma$ fixes $F$, we have $\sigma(K) = \sigma(F(\alpha)) = F(\sigma(\alpha)) \subseteq K$. Because an embedding is injective, the degree of the image field $\sigma(K)$ over $F$ is the same as that of $K/F$. For [finite extensions](@entry_id:152412), this inclusion implies equality: $\sigma(K) = K$.

Conversely, if an extension is not normal, there exists at least one element $\alpha \in K$ with a conjugate $\beta \notin K$. The map sending $\alpha \to \beta$ induces an $F$-embedding $\sigma: F(\alpha) \to F(\beta)$ where $\sigma(F(\alpha)) \neq F(\alpha)$, which can be extended to an embedding of $K$ whose image is not $K$. This powerful equivalence connects normality to the symmetry of the field extension, a cornerstone of Galois theory.

### Key Properties and Classes of Normal Extensions

Certain families of extensions have a guaranteed normality status.

**Degree 2 Extensions:** Any field extension $K/F$ of degree $[K:F] = 2$ is normal.
To see this, let $\alpha \in K \setminus F$. Because the degree is 2, we must have $K = F(\alpha)$. The minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$, let's call it $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$, must have degree 2. We can write it as $m_{\alpha,F}(x) = x^2 + bx + c$ for some $b, c \in F$. One root is $\alpha$. By Vieta's formulas, the other root is $-b - \alpha$. Since $\alpha \in K$ and $b \in F \subset K$, the other root $-b-\alpha$ is also in $K$. Thus, $K$ contains all roots of $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$, making it the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) for this polynomial. Therefore, $K/F$ is a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744) [@problem_id:1809719].

It is important to note that this holds regardless of the characteristic of the field. A common misconception is that this property requires the characteristic of $F$ not to be 2. This is false. In characteristic 2, a [quadratic extension](@entry_id:152175) can be separable (e.g., generated by a root of $x^2 + x + a=0$) or purely inseparable (generated by a root of $x^2-b=0$). In both cases, the extension is generated by an element whose [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) of degree 2 splits completely within the extension, thus satisfying the definition of normality [@problem_id:1809719].

**Finite Fields:** For any [finite field](@entry_id:150913) $F$ and any integer $n \ge 1$, there exists a unique extension field $K$ of degree $n$, and this extension $K/F$ is always normal.
If $|F|=q$, its extension of degree $n$ is the field $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$. This field can be constructed as the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of the polynomial $x^{q^n} - x$ over $F$. Since it is a [splitting field](@entry_id:156669), it is by definition a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744) [@problem_id:1809719].

### The Normal Closure: Making Extensions Normal

If a finite extension $K/F$ is not normal, we can always embed it in a larger field that is. The **[normal closure](@entry_id:139625)** of $K/F$, often denoted $N$, is the smallest [field extension](@entry_id:150367) of $K$ that is a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744) of $F$.

The construction is straightforward: if $K=F(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_m)$, the [normal closure](@entry_id:139625) is the field generated over $F$ by all conjugates of all the generators $\alpha_i$. This is equivalent to finding the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of the product of the minimal polynomials of the $\alpha_i$ over $F$.

For example, we saw that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{5})/\mathbb{Q}$ is not normal. To find its [normal closure](@entry_id:139625), we identify the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) of $\alpha = \sqrt[4]{5}$, which is $p(x) = x^4-5$. The roots are $\alpha, -\alpha, i\alpha, -i\alpha$. The [normal closure](@entry_id:139625) must contain all these roots. Adjoining $\alpha$ gives us the original field. To get the remaining roots, we must also adjoin $i$. The smallest field containing $\{\alpha, i\}$ is $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha, i)$. This field contains all four roots and is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of $p(x)$, so it is the [normal closure](@entry_id:139625) of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{5})$ [@problem_id:1809707]. Its degree over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha,i):\mathbb{Q}]=[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha,i):\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)][\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \cdot 4 = 8$.

### Normality in Field Towers and Composites

The property of normality has interesting, though not always simple, behavior in towers of fields.

**Towers of Fields:** Let $F \subset K \subset L$ be a [tower of fields](@entry_id:153606).
1.  If the total extension $L/F$ is normal, then the top extension $L/K$ is also normal. This is because for any $\alpha \in L$, its minimal polynomial over $K$ divides its [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) over $F$. Since $L/F$ is normal, the minimal polynomial over $F$ splits completely in $L[x]$, so the minimal polynomial over $K$ must also split completely. [@problem_id:1809738].
2.  However, if $L/F$ is normal, the bottom extension $K/F$ is **not** necessarily normal. This is a crucial distinction and a common point of error. A powerful counterexample is the tower $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}) \subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$. The largest extension, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)/\mathbb{Q}$, is normal as it is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of $x^4-2$. However, the intermediate extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})/\mathbb{Q}$ is not normal, as we have established. [@problem_id:1809705].

**Compositum and Intersection:** Let $K_1/F$ and $K_2/F$ be two normal extensions contained within a common overfield.
1.  The **compositum** $K_1K_2$, which is the smallest field containing both $K_1$ and $K_2$, is also a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744) of $F$. If $K_1$ is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of $p_1(x)$ and $K_2$ is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of $p_2(x)$, then $K_1K_2$ is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of the product $p_1(x)p_2(x)$ [@problem_id:1809734].
2.  The **intersection** $K_1 \cap K_2$ is also a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744) of $F$. To see why, let $p(x)$ be an [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) in $F[x]$ with a root $\alpha \in K_1 \cap K_2$. Since $\alpha \in K_1$ and $K_1/F$ is normal, $p(x)$ splits in $K_1$. Similarly, since $\alpha \in K_2$ and $K_2/F$ is normal, $p(x)$ splits in $K_2$. Therefore, all roots of $p(x)$ must lie in both $K_1$ and $K_2$, which means they lie in the intersection $K_1 \cap K_2$. This satisfies the definition for $K_1 \cap K_2$ to be normal over $F$ [@problem_id:1809749].

In summary, the concept of a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744) captures a fundamental notion of algebraic completeness. The equivalent perspectives of splitting polynomials, [splitting fields](@entry_id:151552), and invariant [embeddings](@entry_id:158103) provide a robust toolkit for analyzing the structure of [field extensions](@entry_id:153187). These principles are not merely abstract definitions; they are the essential mechanisms that underpin the entire beautiful structure of Galois theory.
