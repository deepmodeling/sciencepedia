The base field $K$ is a function field over $\\mathbb{F}_3$, so its characteristic is $p=3$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the separability of $\\alpha$. An element is defined as separable over a field $K$ if its minimal polynomial over $K$ is a separable polynomial. A polynomial is separable if all its roots in a splitting field are distinct. For a polynomial $p(x)$ over a field of characteristic $p > 0$, it is separable if and only if its formal derivative, $p'(x)$, is not the zero polynomial.\n\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ is $p(x) = x^3 - t$. Let's compute its formal derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$p'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - t)$$\nThe derivative is computed by treating the coefficients (which are in $K = \\mathbb{F}_3(t)$) according to the rules of calculus. The coefficient of $x^3$ is $1$, and the constant term is $-t$.\n$$p'(x) = 3x^2 - 0 = 3x^2$$\nSince the field of coefficients is $\\mathbb{F}_3$, the integer $3$ is equivalent to $0$. Therefore, in the polynomial ring $K[x]$, we have:\n$$p'(x) = 0 \\cdot x^2 = 0$$\nSince the formal derivative of the minimal polynomial $p(x)$ is the zero polynomial, $p(x)$ is an inseparable polynomial. Consequently, the element $\\alpha$ is not separable over $K$. This eliminates option A.\n\nNext, let's consider whether $\\alpha$ is purely inseparable. An element $\\alpha$ algebraic over a field $K$ of characteristic $p>0$ is defined as purely inseparable over $K$ if its minimal polynomial $p(x)$ over $K$ has only one distinct root. This is equivalent to the condition that $\\alpha^{p^n} \\in K$ for some integer $n \\geq 1$.\n\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ is $p(x) = x^3 - t$. Since $p(\\alpha) = 0$, we have:\n$$\\alpha^3 - t = 0 \\implies \\alpha^3 = t$$\nThe characteristic of our field $K$ is $p=3$. The condition we found is $\\alpha^3 = t$. This is exactly of the form $\\alpha^p = c$, where $p=3$ and $c=t \\in K$. This matches the definition of a purely inseparable element (with $n=1$). Therefore, $\\alpha$ is purely inseparable over $K$. This means option B is a correct statement.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options to be thorough.\nOption C states that $\\alpha$ is both separable and purely inseparable. An element is both separable and purely inseparable over a field $K$ if and only if it belongs to $K$. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$ is $p(x) = x^3 - t$, which has degree $3$. Since the degree of the minimal polynomial is greater than 1, $\\alpha \\notin K$. Thus, option C is false.\n\nOption D states that $\\alpha$ is neither separable nor purely inseparable. Since we have established that $\\alpha$ is purely inseparable, this option is false.\n\nOption E claims that $p(x) = x^3 - t$ is reducible over $K$ and thus cannot be a minimal polynomial. We can check the irreducibility of $p(x)$ over $K = \\mathbb{F}_3(t)$ using Eisenstein's Irreducibility Criterion. We consider $p(x)$ as a polynomial in the variable $x$ with coefficients from the ring $\\mathbb{F}_3[t]$, which is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD). Let's choose the prime element $\\pi = t \\in \\mathbb{F}_3[t]$.\nThe polynomial is $p(x) = 1 \\cdot x^3 + 0 \\cdot x^2 + 0 \\cdot x - t$.\n1. The prime $\\pi=t$ does not divide the leading coefficient, which is $1$.\n2. The prime $\\pi=t$ divides all other coefficients. The coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ are $0$, which are divisible by $t$. The constant term is $-t$, which is divisible by $t$.\n3. The square of the prime, $\\pi^2 = t^2$, does not divide the constant term, $-t$.\nAll conditions of Eisenstein's Criterion are met. Therefore, $p(x)$ is irreducible over the field of fractions of $\\mathbb{F}_3[t]$, which is precisely $K = \\mathbb{F}_3(t)$. Since $p(x)$ is irreducible and monic, and $p(\\alpha)=0$, it is indeed the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$. Thus, option E is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only correct statement is that $\\alpha$ is purely inseparable over $K$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1820600"}, {"introduction": "Moving from verification to creation, this next exercise challenges you to construct an inseparable polynomial from scratch.

This simplifies to $t \\cdot h(t)^2 = q(t)^2$. This implies that $t$ must divide $q(t)^2$, and thus $t$ must divide $q(t)$. This contradicts our assumption that $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are coprime. Therefore, no such $u$ exists in $K$, so $t$ is not a square in $K$. Since $x^2+t$ is a degree-2 polynomial with no roots in $K$, it is irreducible over $K$.
