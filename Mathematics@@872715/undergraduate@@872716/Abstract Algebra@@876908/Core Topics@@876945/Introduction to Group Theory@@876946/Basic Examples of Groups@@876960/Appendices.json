Nonemptiness: $0=0+0\\sqrt{3}\\in H_{1}$. Closure under addition: if $x=a_{1}+b_{1}\\sqrt{3}$ and $y=a_{2}+b_{2}\\sqrt{3}$ with $a_{i},b_{i}\\in \\mathbb{Z}$, then $x+y=(a_{1}+a_{2})+(b_{1}+b_{2})\\sqrt{3}\\in H_{1}$ since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under addition. Closure under additive inverses: $-(a+b\\sqrt{3})=(-a)+(-b)\\sqrt{3}\\in H_{1}$ since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under additive inverses. Hence $H_{1}$ is a subgroup of $(\\mathbb{R},+)$.\n\nFor II, consider $H_{2}=\\{z\\in \\mathbb{C}\\mid z^{n}=1\\text{ for some positive integer }n\\}$ in $(\\mathbb{C}^{\\times},\\times)$. Identity: $1\\in H_{2}$ since $1^{1}=1$. Closure under multiplication: if $z^{m}=1$ and $w^{n}=1$ for some positive integers $m,n$, let $k=\\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)$. Then $(zw)^{k}=z^{k}w^{k}=(z^{m})^{k/m}(w^{n})^{k/n}=1$, so $zw\\in H_{2}$. Closure under inverses: if $z^{m}=1$, then $(z^{-1})^{m}=(z^{m})^{-1}=1$, so $z^{-1}\\in H_{2}$. Hence $H_{2}$ is a subgroup of $(\\mathbb{C}^{\\times},\\times)$.\n\nFor III, consider $H_{3}=\\{r\\in \\mathbb{Q}\\mid \\text{the denominator of }r\\text{ in lowest terms is odd}\\}$ in $(\\mathbb{Q},+)$. Nonemptiness: $0=\\frac{0}{1}\\in H_{3}$ since $1$ is odd. Closure under additive inverses: if $r=\\frac{a}{b}$ in lowest terms with $b$ odd, then $-r=\\frac{-a}{b}$ is in lowest terms with the same odd denominator $b$, so $-r\\in H_{3}$. Closure under addition: let $r=\\frac{a}{b}$ and $s=\\frac{c}{d}$ be in lowest terms with $b,d$ odd. Then\n$$\nr+s=\\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.\n$$\nHere $bd$ is odd because the product of odd integers is odd. Let $g=\\gcd(ad+bc,bd)$. The reduced denominator is $\\frac{bd}{g}$. Since $g\\mid bd$ and $bd$ is odd, $g$ is odd, hence $\\frac{bd}{g}$ is odd. Therefore $r+s$ in lowest terms has odd denominator, so $r+s\\in H_{3}$.
