This first exercise invites you to a similar, yet richer, landscape: the ring of Gaussian integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.

Since $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Unique Factorization Domain, if a monic polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ has a root $z_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$, then $z_0$ must be a divisor of the constant term in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nThe constant term of $P(x)$ is $c_0 = -(1+i)$. We need to find all divisors of $-(1+i)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. The divisors of $-(1+i)$ are the same as the divisors of $1+i$, since $-1$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nTo find the divisors of $1+i$, we first compute its norm. The norm of a Gaussian integer $a+bi$ is $N(a+bi) = a^2+b^2$.\n$$N(1+i) = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2$$\nIf a Gaussian integer $d$ divides $1+i$, then its norm $N(d)$ must divide $N(1+i)=2$. Since the norm is a non-negative integer, the possible values for $N(d)$ are $1$ and $2$.\n\nCase 1: $N(d) = 1$.\nLet $d = a+bi$. Then $a^2+b^2=1$. The integer solutions $(a,b)$ are $(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)$. These correspond to the Gaussian integers $1, -1, i, -i$. These are the units of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nCase 2: $N(d) = 2$.\nLet $d = a+bi$. Then $a^2+b^2=2$. The integer solutions $(a,b)$ are $(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)$. These correspond to the Gaussian integers $1+i, 1-i, -1+i, -1-i$.\n\nThe set of all possible roots is the union of these two sets of divisors:\n$\\{1, -1, i, -i, 1+i, 1-i, -1+i, -1-i\\}$.\n\nNow we test these candidates by substituting them into $P(x)$.\n- $P(1) = 1^3 + (1-i)(1)^2 + (1-2i)(1) - (1+i) = 1 + 1-i + 1-2i - 1-i = 2-4i \\neq 0$.\n- $P(-1) = (-1)^3 + (1-i)(-1)^2 + (1-2i)(-1) - (1+i) = -1 + 1-i -1+2i -1-i = -2 \\neq 0$.\n- $P(i) = i^3 + (1-i)i^2 + (1-2i)i - (1+i) = -i + (1-i)(-1) + i-2i^2 - 1-i = -i -1+i + i+2 -1-i = 0$.\nSo, $x=i$ is a root.\n\nSince $x=i$ is a root, $(x-i)$ must be a factor of $P(x)$. We can perform polynomial division to find the other factors. Using synthetic division with the root $i$:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\ni & 1 & 1-i & 1-2i & -1-i \\\\\n  &   & i     & i      & 1+i \\\\\n\\hline\n  & 1 & 1     & 1-i    & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe quotient is a quadratic polynomial $Q(x) = x^2 + x + (1-i)$. The remaining roots of $P(x)$ are the roots of $Q(x)$. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of $Q(x)$:\n$$x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(1-i)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4 + 4i}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3+4i}}{2}$$\nWe need to find the square root of the complex number $-3+4i$. Let $\\sqrt{-3+4i} = a+bi$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Squaring both sides gives $(a+bi)^2 = a^2-b^2 + 2abi = -3+4i$.\nEquating the real and imaginary parts:\n1) $a^2-b^2 = -3$\n2) $2ab = 4 \\implies ab=2$\nAlso, the magnitude must be equal: $|a+bi|^2 = a^2+b^2 = |-3+4i| = \\sqrt{(-3)^2+4^2} = \\sqrt{9+16}=\\sqrt{25}=5$.\n3) $a^2+b^2=5$\nNow we solve the system of equations:\n(1) + (3): $2a^2 = 2 \\implies a^2=1 \\implies a = \\pm 1$.\n(3) - (1): $2b^2 = 8 \\implies b^2=4 \\implies b = \\pm 2$.\nSince $ab=2 > 0$, $a$ and $b$ must have the same sign. Thus, the square roots are $1+2i$ and $-1-2i$.\n\nLet's use $1+2i$ for the $\\pm$ term in the quadratic formula:\n$$x = \\frac{-1 \\pm (1+2i)}{2}$$\nThis gives two roots:\n$$x_1 = \\frac{-1 + (1+2i)}{2} = \\frac{2i}{2} = i$$\n$$x_2 = \\frac{-1 - (1+2i)}{2} = \\frac{-2-2i}{2} = -1-i$$\nBoth roots, $i$ and $-1-i$, are in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\nThe roots of $P(x)$ are $i$ (from the first step), and $i$ and $-1-i$ (from the quadratic factor). Thus the roots are $i$ (with multiplicity 2) and $-1-i$ (with multiplicity 1).\n\nThe problem asks for the distinct roots.

Property P states that there exists a non-zero polynomial $f(x) \\in R[x]$ with $\\deg(f) < |R|$ that vanishes for all elements of $R$. We will analyze the condition by proving that Property P holds if and only if $R$ is not a field.\n\n**Part 1: Necessity (If $R$ has Property P, then $R$ is not a field)**\n\nLet's assume that $R$ has Property P. This means there exists a non-zero polynomial $f(x) \\in R[x]$ such that $\\deg(f) = d < |R|$ and $f(c) = 0$ for all $c \\in R$. So, the polynomial $f(x)$ has $|R|$ distinct roots.\n\nNow, let's suppose for the sake of contradiction that $R$ is a field. A fundamental property of polynomials over a field is that a non-zero polynomial of degree $d$ can have at most $d$ roots. In our case, $f(x)$ is a non-zero polynomial with degree $d = \\deg(f)$. Since we assumed $R$ is a field, $f(x)$ can have at most $d$ roots.\n\nHowever, Property P states that $f(x)$ has $|R|$ roots. This leads to the inequality $|R| \\le d$. But the definition of Property P also requires that $d < |R|$. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that $R$ is a field must be false. Hence, if $R$ has Property P, it cannot be a field. This establishes that the condition \"$R$ is not a field\" is necessary.\n\n**Part 2: Sufficiency (If $R$ is not a field, then $R$ has Property P)**\n\nNow, let's assume that $R$ is a finite commutative ring with unity that is not a field. We want to show that Property P must hold. We can use the structure theorem for finite commutative rings, which states that any such ring is isomorphic to a direct product of finite local rings. Let $R \\cong R_1 \\times R_2 \\times \\dots \\times R_m$, where each $R_i$ is a finite local ring.\n\nSince $R$ is not a field, there are two possibilities for its structure:\n\n**Case 1: $R$ is a direct product of two or more non-trivial rings (i.e., $m > 1$).**\nLet's assume $R \\cong S \\times T$, where $S$ and $T$ are non-trivial finite commutative rings (i.e., $|S| > 1$ and $|T| > 1$). Let $n_S = |S|$.\nConsider the polynomial $g(y) = \\prod_{s \\in S} (y - s)$ in the polynomial ring $S[y]$. This polynomial is monic of degree $n_S$ and has the property that $g(s) = 0$ for all $s \\in S$. Let's write $g(y) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n_S} c_i y^i$, where $c_i \\in S$ and $c_{n_S}=1_S$.\nNow we construct a polynomial $f(x) \\in R[x]$. For each coefficient $c_i \\in S$ of $g(y)$, we define a corresponding coefficient $a_i \\in R$ as $a_i = (c_i, 0_T)$. Let $f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n_S} a_i x^i$.\n\nLet's check the properties of $f(x)$:\n1.  **Is $f(x)$ non-zero?** The leading coefficient is $a_{n_S} = (c_{n_S}, 0_T) = (1_S, 0_T)$. Since $S$ is non-trivial, $1_S \\neq 0_S$. Thus, $a_{n_S} \\neq (0_S, 0_T) = 0_R$. So, $f(x)$ is a non-zero polynomial.\n2.  **Is $\\deg(f) < |R|$?** The degree of $f(x)$ is $n_S$. The size of the ring $R$ is $|R| = |S| \\times |T| = n_S |T|$. Since $|T| > 1$, we have $\\deg(f) = n_S < n_S |T| = |R|$.\n3.  **Does $f(c) = 0$ for all $c \\in R$?** Let $c$ be an arbitrary element of $R$. We can write $c = (s, t)$ for some $s \\in S$ and $t \\in T$.\n    $f(c) = f((s, t)) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n_S} a_i (s,t)^i = \\sum_{i=0}^{n_S} (c_i, 0_T) (s^i, t^i) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n_S} (c_i s^i, 0_T) = \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{n_S} c_i s^i, 0_T \\right) = (g(s), 0_T)$.\n    By construction, $g(s)=0$ for all $s \\in S$. So, $f(c) = (0_S, 0_T) = 0_R$.\n\nThus, in this case, we have constructed a polynomial $f(x)$ that satisfies all conditions of Property P.\n\n**Case 2: $R$ is a local ring that is not a field (i.e., $m=1$).**\nLet $R$ be a finite local ring with unique maximal ideal $M$. Since $R$ is not a field, $M \\neq \\{0\\}$.\nThe quotient ring $k = R/M$ is a finite field. Let $q = |k|$. For any element $\\bar{c} \\in k$, it is a known property of finite fields that $\\bar{c}^q = \\bar{c}$.\nLet $\\pi: R \\to k=R/M$ be the canonical projection homomorphism. For any $c \\in R$, we have $\\pi(c^q) = (\\pi(c))^q = \\pi(c)$. This implies $\\pi(c^q - c) = 0$, which means that $c^q - c \\in M$ for all $c \\in R$.\n\nBecause $R$ is a finite local ring, its maximal ideal $M$ is the set of all nilpotent elements (the nilradical). Since $M \\neq \\{0\\}$, there is a smallest integer $j \\ge 2$ such that $M^j = \\{0\\}$. Since $M^{j-1} \\neq \\{0\\}$, we can choose a non-zero element $m_0 \\in M^{j-1}$.\nFor any element $m \\in M$, the product $m_0 \\cdot m$ is in $M^{j-1} \\cdot M = M^j = \\{0\\}$. So, $m_0 \\cdot m = 0$ for all $m \\in M$. This means $m_0$ is a non-zero element in the annihilator of $M$.\n\nNow, let's define the polynomial $f(x) = m_0 (x^q - x) \\in R[x]$.\n1.  **Is $f(x)$ non-zero?** The coefficients of $x^q-x$ are $1$ and $-1$. Since $m_0 \\neq 0$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is non-zero. Its leading coefficient is $m_0$.\n2.  **Is $\\deg(f) < |R|$?** The degree of $f(x)$ is $q = |k| = |R/M|$. Since $M$ is a non-trivial ideal, $|M|>1$. The size of the ring is $|R| = |M| \\cdot |R/M| = |M| \\cdot q$. Since $|M|>1$, we have $\\deg(f) = q < |M|q = |R|$.\n3.  **Does $f(c) = 0$ for all $c \\in R$?** For any $c \\in R$, let $d = c^q - c$. We have already shown that $d \\in M$. Then $f(c) = m_0 \\cdot (c^q - c) = m_0 \\cdot d$. Since $m_0$ annihilates every element of $M$, and $d \\in M$, we have $m_0 \\cdot d = 0$.\n\nThus, in this case as well, we have constructed a polynomial $f(x)$ satisfying Property P.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have demonstrated that a finite commutative ring with unity $R$ possesses Property P if and only if $R$ is not a field. This makes option D the correct choice.\n\nLet's briefly examine the other options:\nA. \"$R$ is a local ring\" is not necessary ($\\mathbb{Z}_6 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$ has the property but is not local) nor sufficient (a field like $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is local but does not have the property).\nB. \"$R$ is not a direct product of two non-trivial rings\" is equivalent to \"$R$ is indecomposable\", which for finite commutative rings means \"$R$ is a local ring\". This is incorrect for the same reason as A.\nC. \"$R$ is a field\" is the exact negation of the correct condition.\nE. \"The characteristic of $R$ is a composite number\" is a sufficient but not necessary condition. If char($R$) is composite, $R$ contains zero divisors and cannot be a field, so it has Property P. However, the ring $R=\\mathbb{Z}_p[t]/\\langle t^2 \\rangle$ has prime characteristic $p$ and is not a field, so it has Property P. Thus, the condition is not necessary.\n\nTherefore, the only condition that is both necessary and sufficient is that $R$ is not a field.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1819354"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice delves into the fascinating effects of nilpotent elements—elements $u$ such that $u^n=0$ for some $n$.
