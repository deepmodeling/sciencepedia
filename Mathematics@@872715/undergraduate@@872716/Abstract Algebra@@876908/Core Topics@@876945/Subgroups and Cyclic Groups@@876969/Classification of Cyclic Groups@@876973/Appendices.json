Since none of these Sylow $2$-subgroups is normal (otherwise $n_{2}=1$), each has normalizer of order $2$, and distinct order $2$ subgroups intersect trivially. Hence the kernel is trivial, so $\\varphi$ is injective. Because $|G|=|S_{3}|=6$, $\\varphi$ is an isomorphism, and $G\\cong S_{3}$, which is non-abelian.
