This law allows us to deconstruct a complicated extension into a sequence of simpler, more manageable steps.

An algebraic field extension $K$ of $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be viewed as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$.

Determine the degree of this field extension, $[L : \\mathbb{Q}]$.", "solution": "To find the degree of the field extension $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}, \\sqrt{15}) : \\mathbb{Q}]$, we can use the Tower Law for field extensions. The Tower Law states that for a chain of field extensions $F \\subseteq K \\subseteq L$, the degrees are related by the formula $[L : F] = [L : K] \\cdot [K : F]$.\n\nWe can construct a tower of fields: $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}, \\sqrt{15})$.\nApplying the Tower Law to this tower, we get:\n$$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}, \\sqrt{15}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}, \\sqrt{15}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}) : \\mathbb{Q}]$$\n\nWe now need to compute the two degrees on the right-hand side.\n\nFirst, let's find $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}) : \\mathbb{Q}]$. This degree is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{6}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The number $\\sqrt{6}$ is a root of the polynomial $x^2 - 6 = 0$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can show this using the Rational Root Theorem: if there were a rational root $p/q$, then $p$ must divide $-6$ and $q$ must divide $1$. The possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6$, none of which are roots of the polynomial. Since $x^2 - 6$ is a degree-2 polynomial with no rational roots, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, $x^2 - 6$ is the minimal polynomial for $\\sqrt{6}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of this polynomial is 2, so we have:\n$$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$$\n\nNext, let's find $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}, \\sqrt{15}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})]$. This is the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{15}$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$.\nThe number $\\sqrt{15}$ is a root of the polynomial $x^2 - 15 = 0$. The coefficients of this polynomial, 1 and -15, are in $\\mathbb{Q}$, and therefore also in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. To determine if this is the minimal polynomial, we must check if it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. A degree-2 polynomial is irreducible over a field if and only if it has no roots in that field. So, we need to check if $\\sqrt{15}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\sqrt{15} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$.\nElements of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$ have the form $a + b\\sqrt{6}$ where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo, our assumption means there exist rational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that:\n$$\\sqrt{15} = a + b\\sqrt{6}$$\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get:\n$$15 = (a + b\\sqrt{6})^2$$\n$$15 = a^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{6} + 6b^2$$\n$$15 - a^2 - 6b^2 = 2ab\\sqrt{6}$$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are rational, the left-hand side of the equation is rational. The right-hand side is a rational number ($2ab$) multiplied by an irrational number ($\\sqrt{6}$). The only way a rational number can equal an irrational number multiplied by a rational is if both sides are zero.\nThis implies two conditions must hold:\n1. $2ab = 0$\n2. $15 - a^2 - 6b^2 = 0$\n\nFrom the first condition, $2ab=0$, we must have either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\nCase 1: $a=0$. The second equation becomes $15 - 6b^2 = 0$, which implies $6b^2 = 15$, so $b^2 = \\frac{15}{6} = \\frac{5}{2}$. This would mean $b = \\pm\\sqrt{5/2}$, which is not a rational number. This contradicts our definition of $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nCase 2: $b=0$. The second equation becomes $15 - a^2 = 0$, which implies $a^2 = 15$. This would mean $a = \\pm\\sqrt{15}$, which is not a rational number. This contradicts our definition of $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBoth cases lead to a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that $\\sqrt{15} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$ is false.\nSince $\\sqrt{15}$ is not in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$, the polynomial $x^2 - 15$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$ and is thus irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. It is therefore the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{15}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. The degree of this polynomial is 2. So,\n$$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}, \\sqrt{15}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})] = 2$$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total degree using the Tower Law:\n$$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}, \\sqrt{15}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}, \\sqrt{15}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1828604"}, {"introduction": "Moving from specific computations to abstract reasoning, we can explore the deep connection between field extensions and polynomial theory.
