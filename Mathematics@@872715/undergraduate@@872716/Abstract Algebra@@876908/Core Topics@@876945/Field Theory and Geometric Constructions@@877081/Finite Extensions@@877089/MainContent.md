## Introduction
The concept of a field extension, where one field contains another, is a cornerstone of modern abstract algebra. It provides a framework for analyzing the structure of fields and understanding the nature of solutions to polynomial equations. However, simply acknowledging the existence of an extension is not enough; a deeper understanding requires tools to quantify its size and qualify its properties. This article addresses this need by introducing the theory of finite extensions, which provides a precise language for exploring the intricate relationships between fields.

This article will guide you through the essential principles that govern these structures. In "Principles and Mechanisms," you will learn to measure extensions using their degree, master the powerful Tower Law for calculating degrees of composite extensions, and distinguish between extensions based on the crucial properties of separability and normality. Following this, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate the far-reaching impact of this theory, showing how it provides definitive answers to ancient geometric problems, illuminates the structure of finite fields, and forms the bedrock of modern [algebraic number](@entry_id:156710) theory. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will offer concrete problems to solidify your understanding of arithmetic and structural analysis within these extensions.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Having established the foundational concept of a field extension, we now delve into the principles and mechanisms that govern their structure. A [field extension](@entry_id:150367) $K/F$ can be viewed through the lens of linear algebra, where $K$ is a vector space over the field of scalars $F$. This perspective provides a powerful quantitative measure—the degree—which unlocks a deeper understanding of the relationships between fields. We will explore how this single number constrains the structure of extensions and then move to more qualitative properties, namely separability and normality, which are central to the development of Galois theory.

### The Degree of a Field Extension

The most fundamental [characteristic of a field](@entry_id:154613) extension $K/F$ is its **degree**, denoted $[K:F]$. The degree is defined as the dimension of $K$ considered as a vector space over $F$.
$$[K:F] = \dim_F(K)$$
If this dimension is finite, the extension is called a **finite extension**; otherwise, it is an **infinite extension**. For example, the extension $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}$ is finite with degree 2, since $\{1, i\}$ forms a basis. In contrast, the extension $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}$ is infinite. Our focus will be on finite extensions.

A particularly important and common type of extension is a **[simple extension](@entry_id:152948)**, which is generated by adjoining a single element $\alpha$ to a base field $F$, denoted $F(\alpha)$. If $\alpha$ is **algebraic** over $F$, meaning it is a root of some non-zero polynomial in $F[x]$, then the extension $F(\alpha)/F$ is finite. The degree of this extension is intimately connected to the **[minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598)** of $\alpha$ over $F$, denoted $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$. This is the unique monic [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) in $F[x]$ for which $m_{\alpha,F}(\alpha) = 0$.

A cornerstone theorem of field theory states that the degree of a simple [algebraic extension](@entry_id:155470) is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of the generating element.

**Theorem:** If $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$, then $[F(\alpha):F] = \deg(m_{\alpha,F}(x))$.

For instance, consider an element $\alpha$ that is algebraic over the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ and is a root of an [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) $p(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ of degree 3. Since $p(x)$ is irreducible and has $\alpha$ as a root, the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, $m_{\alpha,\mathbb{Q}}(x)$, must be an associate of $p(x)$. As minimal polynomials are monic by definition, $m_{\alpha,\mathbb{Q}}(x)$ is simply $p(x)$ divided by its leading coefficient. Consequently, $\deg(m_{\alpha,\mathbb{Q}}(x)) = 3$. Applying the theorem, we find that the degree of the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)/\mathbb{Q}$ is 3 [@problem_id:1795271].

Furthermore, the set $\{1, \alpha, \alpha^2, \dots, \alpha^{n-1}\}$, where $n = [F(\alpha):F]$, forms a basis for $F(\alpha)$ as a vector space over $F$. This means that every element in the field $F(\alpha)$ can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these basis elements with coefficients in $F$. That is, any element $\beta \in F(\alpha)$ can be written as:
$$\beta = c_0 + c_1\alpha + c_2\alpha^2 + \dots + c_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}, \quad c_i \in F$$

A crucial point is that $F(\alpha)$ is not just a vector space; it is a field. This implies that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse within the set. Let's explore the mechanism for finding this inverse. Suppose $\alpha$ is a root of the [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) $p(x) = x^3 + x + 1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)/\mathbb{Q}$ is 3, and a basis is $\{1, \alpha, \alpha^2\}$. The fact that $\alpha$ is a root gives us the fundamental relation $\alpha^3 + \alpha + 1 = 0$, or $\alpha^3 = -\alpha - 1$. This allows us to reduce any power of $\alpha$ greater than or equal to 3 to a linear combination of the basis elements.

To find the inverse of $\alpha$, we need to find coefficients $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $\alpha^{-1} = a + b\alpha + c\alpha^2$. Multiplying by $\alpha$, we get:
$$1 = \alpha(a + b\alpha + c\alpha^2) = a\alpha + b\alpha^2 + c\alpha^3$$
Substituting our relation for $\alpha^3$:
$$1 = a\alpha + b\alpha^2 + c(-\alpha - 1) = -c + (a-c)\alpha + b\alpha^2$$
Since $\{1, \alpha, \alpha^2\}$ is a basis, the representation is unique. We can equate the coefficients of the corresponding powers of $\alpha$ on both sides:
$$\begin{cases} -c = 1 \\ a-c = 0 \\ b = 0 \end{cases}$$
Solving this system yields $c = -1$, $a = -1$, and $b=0$. Therefore, the [multiplicative inverse](@entry_id:137949) of $\alpha$ is $\alpha^{-1} = -1 - \alpha^2$ [@problem_id:1795274]. This procedure, which relies on the minimal polynomial, guarantees that every non-zero element in a simple [algebraic extension](@entry_id:155470) has an inverse, confirming its field structure.

### The Tower Law and Composite Extensions

While simple extensions are foundational, we often encounter extensions generated by multiple elements, like $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$. To analyze the degree of such extensions, we use one of the most powerful tools in field theory: the **Tower Law**.

**Theorem (The Tower Law):** If $F \subseteq E \subseteq K$ is a tower of [field extensions](@entry_id:153187), then the degrees are multiplicative:
$$[K:F] = [K:E] \cdot [E:F]$$

This theorem allows us to calculate the degree of a complex extension by breaking it down into a series of simpler steps. Consider the extension $\mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt{2})/\mathbb{Q}$. We can construct a [tower of fields](@entry_id:153606): $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt{2})$.
1.  The first step is the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})/\mathbb{Q}$. The [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) of $\sqrt{2}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2-2$, so $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}):\mathbb{Q}] = 2$. A basis for this extension is $\{1, \sqrt{2}\}$.
2.  The second step is $\mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt{2})/\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$, which is the same as $(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}))(i)/\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. We need the minimal polynomial of $i$ over the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. The polynomial $x^2+1$ has $i$ as a root. This polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ because its roots, $\pm i$, are not in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ (a field of real numbers). Thus, $[\mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt{2}):\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] = 2$. A basis for this extension is $\{1, i\}$.

Applying the Tower Law, the degree of the total extension is:
$$[\mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt{2}):\mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt{2}):\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] \cdot [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}):\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \cdot 2 = 4$$
Moreover, a basis for the composite extension over $\mathbb{Q}$ can be constructed by taking all products of the basis elements from each step in the tower. The basis for $\mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt{2})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\{1, \sqrt{2}\} \times \{1, i\} = \{1 \cdot 1, 1 \cdot i, \sqrt{2} \cdot 1, \sqrt{2} \cdot i\}$, which simplifies to $\{1, i, \sqrt{2}, i\sqrt{2}\}$ [@problem_id:1795338].

An immediate and profound consequence of the Tower Law concerns extensions of prime degree. If $[K:F] = p$, where $p$ is a prime number, then for any intermediate field $E$ (i.e., $F \subseteq E \subseteq K$), the Tower Law gives $p = [K:E][E:F]$. Since $p$ is prime, its only integer factors are 1 and $p$. This forces either $[K:E]=1$ (which means $E=K$) or $[E:F]=1$ (which means $E=F$). Therefore, an extension of prime degree has no **proper [intermediate fields](@entry_id:153550)**. For example, the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[5]{7})/\mathbb{Q}$ has degree 5, as the minimal polynomial is $x^5-7$ (irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion). Since 5 is prime, there are no fields strictly between $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[5]{7})$ [@problem_id:1795299]. In contrast, an extension like $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})/\mathbb{Q}$ has degree 4 and contains proper [intermediate fields](@entry_id:153550) like $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$.

The same principles apply to [finite fields](@entry_id:142106). A [finite field](@entry_id:150913) $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ can be viewed as an extension of its prime subfield $\mathbb{F}_p$. Since it has $p^n$ elements and is an $n$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_p$, its degree is $n$. For instance, $[\mathbb{F}_{27}:\mathbb{F}_3] = [\mathbb{F}_{3^3}:\mathbb{F}_3] = 3$ [@problem_id:1795290]. Since this degree is prime, there are no [intermediate fields](@entry_id:153550) between $\mathbb{F}_{27}$ and $\mathbb{F}_3$.

When considering the **compositum** of two extensions, $K_1$ and $K_2$, denoted $K_1K_2$ (the smallest field containing both), the Tower Law leads to a powerful formula relating its degree to the degrees of the constituent fields and their intersection:
$$[K_1K_2 : F] = \frac{[K_1:F][K_2:F]}{[K_1 \cap K_2 : F]}$$
The utility of this formula hinges on determining the possible degrees of the intersection $K_1 \cap K_2$. Since $K_1 \cap K_2$ is a subfield of both $K_1$ and $K_2$, the Tower Law implies that $[K_1 \cap K_2 : F]$ must be a common divisor of $[K_1:F]$ and $[K_2:F]$.

As an illustration, suppose we have extensions $K_1/\mathbb{Q}$ and $K_2/\mathbb{Q}$ with $[K_1:\mathbb{Q}]=6$ and $[K_2:\mathbb{Q}]=10$. The degree of their intersection, $[K_1 \cap K_2:\mathbb{Q}]$, must divide both 6 and 10. The [greatest common divisor](@entry_id:142947) is $\gcd(6, 10)=2$, so the possible values for $[K_1 \cap K_2:\mathbb{Q}]$ are the divisors of 2, namely 1 and 2. This gives two possible degrees for the compositum:
1.  If $[K_1 \cap K_2:\mathbb{Q}] = 1$, then $[K_1K_2:\mathbb{Q}] = \frac{6 \cdot 10}{1} = 60$.
2.  If $[K_1 \cap K_2:\mathbb{Q}] = 2$, then $[K_1K_2:\mathbb{Q}] = \frac{6 \cdot 10}{2} = 30$.
Both scenarios are possible and can be constructed, so the set of possible degrees is $\{30, 60\}$ [@problem_id:1795325]. A special case arises when the degrees $[K_1:F]$ and $[K_2:F]$ are coprime. In that case, the degree of the intersection must be 1, leading to the simple result $[K_1K_2:F] = [K_1:F][K_2:F]$. This generalizes to multiple extensions. For instance, if we construct the field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ where the minimal polynomials of $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ have degrees 3, 7, and 2, respectively, the degrees of the corresponding simple extensions are [pairwise coprime](@entry_id:154147). A repeated application of the Tower Law shows that the degree of the full extension is the product of the individual degrees: $[K:\mathbb{Q}] = 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 2 = 42$ [@problem_id:1795333].

### Separable and Normal Extensions

Beyond the quantitative measure of degree, we need qualitative descriptors for [field extensions](@entry_id:153187). Two of the most important are separability and normality.

#### Separability

The concept of separability relates to the roots of minimal polynomials. An [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) $f(x) \in F[x]$ is **separable** if it has no [repeated roots](@entry_id:151486) in its [splitting field](@entry_id:156669). An [algebraic element](@entry_id:149440) $\alpha$ is **separable** over $F$ if its [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$ is separable. A [field extension](@entry_id:150367) $K/F$ is **separable** if every element of $K$ is separable over $F$.

A simple and effective test for separability involves the [formal derivative](@entry_id:150637). An [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) $f(x)$ is separable if and only if its derivative, $f'(x)$, is not the zero polynomial.
- In a field of **characteristic 0** (like $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$, or $\mathbb{C}$), if $f(x)$ is an [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) of degree $n \ge 1$, its derivative $f'(x)$ is a non-zero polynomial of degree $n-1$. Since $f(x)$ is irreducible, it cannot share a factor (and thus a root) with the lower-degree polynomial $f'(x)$. Consequently, all [irreducible polynomials](@entry_id:152257) in characteristic 0 are separable, and all [algebraic extensions](@entry_id:156472) of characteristic 0 fields are separable.
- In a field of **characteristic p** (like $\mathbb{F}_p$ or $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$), the situation is more subtle. The derivative of $x^p$ is $px^{p-1} = 0$, so a polynomial can be non-constant and yet have a [zero derivative](@entry_id:145492). For example, consider the polynomial $P(x) = x^p - t$ over the field $F = \mathbb{F}_p(t)$ of rational functions in $t$. Its derivative is $P'(x) = 0$. This is an example of an **inseparable** polynomial, and an extension generated by its root is an [inseparable extension](@entry_id:156235).

However, not all extensions in characteristic $p$ are inseparable. Consider the **Artin-Schreier polynomial** $P(x) = x^p - x - t$ over $F = \mathbb{F}_p(t)$. Its [formal derivative](@entry_id:150637) is $P'(x) = p x^{p-1} - 1 = -1$, which is non-zero. Since the polynomial and its derivative share no common roots, $P(x)$ is separable. An extension $F(\alpha)/F$ where $\alpha$ is a root of $P(x)$ is therefore a separable extension [@problem_id:1795295].

#### Normality

Normality addresses the question of whether an extension contains a "complete" set of roots. A finite extension $K/F$ is a **[normal extension](@entry_id:155744)** if for every [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) $p(x) \in F[x]$, if $p(x)$ has one root in $K$, then all of its roots must lie in $K$. In other words, a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744) is one where any [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) over the base field either has no roots or splits completely into linear factors.

An equivalent and often more practical characterization is that an extension $K/F$ is normal if and only if $K$ is the **[splitting field](@entry_id:156669)** of some polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$. A [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) is the smallest extension field that contains all the roots of $f(x)$.

Let's examine some examples over $\mathbb{Q}$ [@problem_id:1809739]:
- The extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{5})/\mathbb{Q}$ is **not normal**. The [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) of $\sqrt[4]{5}$ is $x^4-5$. This polynomial has four roots in $\mathbb{C}$: $\sqrt[4]{5}$, $-\sqrt[4]{5}$, $i\sqrt[4]{5}$, and $-i\sqrt[4]{5}$. The field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{5})$ is a [subfield](@entry_id:155812) of $\mathbb{R}$ and contains the first two roots, but not the imaginary roots. Since it contains one root but not all, the extension is not normal.
- The extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, i)/\mathbb{Q}$ **is normal**. This field contains $\sqrt{3}$, $-\sqrt{3}$, $i$, and $-i$. These are precisely the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = (x^2-3)(x^2+1) = x^4 - 2x^2 - 3 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. Since $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, i)$ is the smallest field containing these roots, it is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of $f(x)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and is therefore a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744).
- The extension $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)/\mathbb{Q}$ where $\alpha$ is a root of $x^3+x+1=0$ is **not normal**. This cubic polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. Its [discriminant](@entry_id:152620) is $\Delta = -4(1)^3 - 27(1)^2 = -31$, which is negative. This implies that the polynomial has one real root and two [complex conjugate roots](@entry_id:276596). The field $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ can be taken to be the real extension, in which case it does not contain the other two [complex roots](@entry_id:172941). Thus, it is not a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744).

#### Galois Extensions and the Fundamental Theorem

The properties of being finite, separable, and normal are the three pillars of **Galois theory**. An extension $K/F$ that satisfies all three properties is called a **Galois extension**. For such extensions, there is a profound connection between the structure of the extension and a group of its symmetries, known as the **Galois group**, $\text{Gal}(K/F)$.

The **Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory** establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the [intermediate fields](@entry_id:153550) $E$ of a Galois extension $K/F$ and the subgroups of its Galois group $\text{Gal}(K/F)$. This theorem transforms difficult questions about fields into more [tractable problems](@entry_id:269211) in [finite group theory](@entry_id:146601).

For example, consider the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) $K$ of the polynomial $p(x) = x^4 + 8x + 12$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. This is a Galois extension. Through advanced techniques involving the polynomial's [discriminant](@entry_id:152620) and resolvent cubic, one can determine that its Galois group is isomorphic to the alternating group $A_4$, which has order 12. The Fundamental Theorem then asserts that the number of [intermediate fields](@entry_id:153550) between $\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$ is exactly equal to the number of subgroups of $A_4$. A group-theoretic analysis reveals that $A_4$ has exactly 10 subgroups (the trivial group, three of order 2, one of order 4, four of order 3, and $A_4$ itself). Therefore, the extension $K/\mathbb{Q}$ must have exactly 10 [intermediate fields](@entry_id:153550) [@problem_id:1795280]. This powerful conclusion, drawn from the abstract structure of a group, demonstrates the depth and utility of classifying extensions by their fundamental properties.
