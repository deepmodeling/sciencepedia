If the original cube has a side length of 1 unit, the new cube must have a side length of $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ units. A student of mathematics, having just learned that numbers like $\\sqrt{2}$ are constructible with a compass and an unmarked straightedge, makes the following argument:\n\n\"The number $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is a well-defined real number. We can pinpoint its exact location on the real number line, which lies somewhere between 1.25 and 1.26. Since we can identify its position as a length on a line, it must be possible to construct this length from a given unit length using the standard tools of Euclidean geometry: a compass and an unmarked straightedge.\"\n\nWhile the student's intuition seems plausible, their conclusion is famously incorrect. The task of doubling the cube is impossible with only a compass and straightedge. From the perspective of abstract algebra and field theory, what is the fundamental algebraic flaw in the student's reasoning?\n\nA. The argument fails to acknowledge that compass and straightedge constructions prohibit markings on the straightedge, which would be necessary to \"measure\" and transfer the length $\\sqrt[3]{2}$.\n\nB. The argument incorrectly assumes that irrational numbers can be constructed. Geometric constructions starting from a unit length can only ever produce lengths corresponding to rational numbers.\n\nC.

A number $\\alpha$ is constructible only if the degree of the field extension $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$ is a power of 2, a condition which $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ fails to meet.\n\nD. The argument overlooks the fact that the polynomial $x^3 - 2 = 0$, of which $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is a root, also has complex roots. Geometric constructions are confined to the real plane, and the existence of conjugate complex roots prevents any of the polynomial's real roots from being constructible.\n\nE. The argument is flawed because $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is a transcendental number, meaning it is not the root of any polynomial with integer coefficients.

In classical Euclidean constructions starting from a unit segment, a length $\\alpha$ is constructible if and only if it lies in a field obtained from $\\mathbb{Q}$ by a tower of quadratic extensions.

The flaw in the student's argument is the incorrect identification of “real and well-defined” with “constructible”; constructibility imposes the algebraic degree condition above, which $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ fails. This aligns with option C and rules out the others: constructible numbers include irrational numbers (so B is false), the unmarked straightedge restriction is not the decisive algebraic barrier (so A is irrelevant here), the existence of complex conjugates does not preclude constructibility of a real root (so D is false), and $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is algebraic, not transcendental (so E is false).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1802241"}]}
