## Introduction
In the study of abstract algebra, the concept of a field provides the foundation for understanding number systems and polynomial equations. While familiar fields like the rational numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$) or real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) are a starting point, many profound mathematical questions require us to build larger, more intricate fields. This leads to the central idea of a field extension, and at its heart lies the most fundamental type: the **[simple extension](@entry_id:152948)**. This article addresses the essential question of how adjoining a single new element to a base field creates a new, richer algebraic structure with predictable and powerful properties.

Throughout the following chapters, we will embark on a comprehensive exploration of simple extensions. In **Principles and Mechanisms**, you will learn the core definitions, distinguishing between algebraic and transcendental extensions and mastering the arithmetic within these new fields. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will reveal how this seemingly abstract concept serves as a crucial tool in number theory, geometry, and the construction of finite fields for modern technology. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will offer a chance to solidify your understanding by tackling concrete problems. We begin by examining the foundational principles that govern the structure and mechanics of these extensions.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Following our introduction to the concept of [field extensions](@entry_id:153187), we now delve into the principles and mechanisms of a particularly fundamental and ubiquitous type: the **[simple extension](@entry_id:152948)**. A [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) of a field $F$ is a field denoted $F(\alpha)$, which is defined as the smallest field that contains both the base field $F$ and a single external element $\alpha$. The properties of this new field are entirely determined by the relationship between $\alpha$ and $F$.

### The Structure of Simple Extensions: Algebraic vs. Transcendental

The nature of a [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) $F(\alpha)$ bifurcates based on whether the adjoined element $\alpha$ is algebraic or transcendental over the base field $F$.

An element $\alpha$ is **algebraic** over $F$ if it is a root of a non-zero polynomial with coefficients in $F$. Among all such polynomials, there is one unique [monic polynomial](@entry_id:152311) of minimal degree, known as the **[minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598)** of $\alpha$ over $F$, denoted $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$. A crucial property of the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) is that it is always **irreducible** over $F$. If it were reducible, say $m_{\alpha,F}(x) = g(x)h(x)$ with $\deg(g), \deg(h)  \deg(m_{\alpha,F})$, then $m_{\alpha,F}(\alpha) = g(\alpha)h(\alpha) = 0$ would imply either $g(\alpha)=0$ or $h(\alpha)=0$, contradicting the minimality of the degree of $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$.

When $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$, the [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) $F(\alpha)$ can be viewed as a **vector space** over the field $F$. The **degree** of the extension, denoted $[F(\alpha):F]$, is the dimension of this vector space. A foundational theorem of [field theory](@entry_id:155241) states that the degree of the extension is precisely the degree of the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598):
$$[F(\alpha):F] = \deg(m_{\alpha,F}(x))$$
Let's say the degree of this extension is $n$. The set $\{1, \alpha, \alpha^2, \dots, \alpha^{n-1}\}$ forms a basis for $F(\alpha)$ as a vector space over $F$. This means that every element $\beta \in F(\alpha)$ can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of these basis elements:
$$\beta = c_0 + c_1\alpha + c_2\alpha^2 + \dots + c_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}$$
where the coefficients $c_0, c_1, \dots, c_{n-1}$ are all in the base field $F$.

For instance, consider a polynomial $p(x) = x^5 - 6x^4 + 3x^2 - 12x + 9$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, a fact that can be established by observing its reduction modulo 2, $x^5+x^2+1$, is irreducible over the field with two elements $\mathbb{F}_2$. If $\alpha$ is a root of this polynomial, then $p(x)$ is its [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) over $\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of the [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is therefore equal to the degree of this polynomial, so $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}] = 5$ [@problem_id:1821122].

In contrast, an element $\beta$ is **transcendental** over $F$ if it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with coefficients in $F$. In this case, the set of powers $\{1, \beta, \beta^2, \beta^3, \dots\}$ is linearly independent over $F$. Consequently, the extension $F(\beta)$ is an infinite-dimensional vector space over $F$, and we write $[F(\beta):F] = \infty$. This field is isomorphic to the field of rational functions in one variable, $F(x)$.

The distinction is profound. For an [algebraic element](@entry_id:149440) like $\alpha = \sqrt[3]{7}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, its [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) is $x^3 - 7 = 0$. The set $\{1, \alpha, \alpha^2, \alpha^3\}$ is linearly dependent because we have the relation $1 \cdot \alpha^3 + 0 \cdot \alpha^2 + 0 \cdot \alpha - 7 \cdot 1 = 0$. The smallest positive integer $n_1$ for which $\{1, \alpha, \dots, \alpha^{n_1}\}$ is linearly dependent is $n_1=3$, the degree of the extension. For a [transcendental number](@entry_id:155894) such as $\pi$, no such [linear dependence](@entry_id:149638) relation with rational coefficients exists for any [finite set](@entry_id:152247) of its powers. This holds true not just for $\pi$ but also for powers of it, such as $\pi^2$. If $\pi^2$ were algebraic, satisfying a polynomial equation $a_k(\pi^2)^k + \dots + a_0 = 0$, then $\pi$ itself would satisfy $a_k x^{2k} + \dots + a_0 = 0$, contradicting its transcendentality. Therefore, for a transcendental element $\beta$, no finite integer $n_2$ makes the set $\{1, \beta^2, \dots, (\beta^2)^{n_2}\}$ linearly dependent [@problem_id:1821166].

### Arithmetic in Simple Algebraic Extensions

The vector space structure of $F(\alpha)$ provides a clear framework for performing arithmetic. Addition and subtraction are performed component-wise, just as with vectors. Multiplication is more involved but follows a systematic procedure. To multiply two elements in $F(\alpha)$, we first treat them as polynomials in $\alpha$ and multiply them using standard polynomial distribution. The result will likely contain powers of $\alpha$ equal to or greater than the degree $n$ of the extension. At this point, the minimal polynomial $m_{\alpha,F}(x) = 0$ provides the crucial reduction rule.

Let's illustrate with an example in $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ where $\alpha = \sqrt[3]{5}$. The [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) is $x^3-5=0$, giving us the relation $\alpha^3 = 5$. We can use this to reduce any higher powers of $\alpha$. For example, $\alpha^4 = \alpha \cdot \alpha^3 = \alpha \cdot 5 = 5\alpha$, and $\alpha^5 = \alpha^2 \cdot \alpha^3 = 5\alpha^2$.

Consider the multiplication of two elements $x = 2 - 3\alpha + \frac{1}{2}\alpha^2$ and $y = 1 + \alpha - 2\alpha^2$:
$$xy = \left(2 - 3\alpha + \frac{1}{2}\alpha^2\right)\left(1 + \alpha - 2\alpha^2\right)$$
Expanding this product gives:
$$xy = 2(1 + \alpha - 2\alpha^2) - 3\alpha(1 + \alpha - 2\alpha^2) + \frac{1}{2}\alpha^2(1 + \alpha - 2\alpha^2)$$
$$xy = (2 + 2\alpha - 4\alpha^2) - (3\alpha + 3\alpha^2 - 6\alpha^3) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\alpha^2 + \frac{1}{2}\alpha^3 - \alpha^4\right)$$
Combining terms with like powers of $\alpha$:
$$xy = 2 - \alpha - \frac{13}{2}\alpha^2 + \frac{13}{2}\alpha^3 - \alpha^4$$
Now, we apply the [reduction rules](@entry_id:274292) $\alpha^3 = 5$ and $\alpha^4 = 5\alpha$:
$$xy = 2 - \alpha - \frac{13}{2}\alpha^2 + \frac{13}{2}(5) - (5\alpha)$$
$$xy = \left(2 + \frac{65}{2}\right) + (-1 - 5)\alpha - \frac{13}{2}\alpha^2 = \frac{69}{2} - 6\alpha - \frac{13}{2}\alpha^2$$
The result is now properly expressed in the basis $\{1, \alpha, \alpha^2\}$ [@problem_id:1821150]. This same reduction process is used whenever high powers of the adjoined element appear [@problem_id:1821120].

The existence of multiplicative inverses is what elevates the structure from a ring to a field. For any non-zero element $\beta \in F(\alpha)$, its inverse $\beta^{-1}$ must also exist within $F(\alpha)$. Finding this inverse is a classic application of linear algebra. Let $\beta = a + b\alpha + c\alpha^2$ in the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ where $\alpha^3 - \alpha + 1 = 0$. We seek an inverse $\beta^{-1} = d_0 + d_1\alpha + d_2\alpha^2$ such that $\beta \cdot \beta^{-1} = 1$.

$$(a + b\alpha + c\alpha^2)(d_0 + d_1\alpha + d_2\alpha^2) = 1$$

After expanding this product and repeatedly using the relation $\alpha^3 = \alpha - 1$ to reduce all powers of $\alpha$ to less than 3, we group terms by the basis elements $\{1, \alpha, \alpha^2\}$. Equating the coefficient of $1$ to one and the coefficients of $\alpha$ and $\alpha^2$ to zero yields a $3 \times 3$ system of linear equations for the unknown coefficients $d_0, d_1, d_2$. The coefficients of this system's matrix are functions of $a, b,$ and $c$. As long as $\beta$ is not the zero element, this system has a unique solution, which provides the coefficients for $\beta^{-1}$ [@problem_id:1821116]. This procedure guarantees that $F(\alpha)$ is closed under division by non-zero elements, confirming it is indeed a field.

It is worth noting that for an [algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088) $\alpha$ (a root of a [monic polynomial](@entry_id:152311) with integer coefficients), the [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is identical to the [field of fractions](@entry_id:148415) of the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$. The latter is constructed by taking all ratios of elements from the ring of polynomials in $\alpha$ with integer coefficients. Proving this involves showing mutual inclusion: $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ contains $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ and is a field, so it must contain its [field of fractions](@entry_id:148415). Conversely, the [field of fractions](@entry_id:148415) of $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ contains both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\alpha$, and must therefore contain the minimal field with this property, which is $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ [@problem_id:1821138].

### Advanced Properties and Applications

Simple extensions are central to many advanced topics in algebra, including Galois theory. Here we explore some of these connections.

#### The Primitive Element Theorem

One might wonder what happens when we adjoin multiple elements, such as in the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i)$. This is the smallest field containing the rationals, $\sqrt{2}$, and $i$. The **Primitive Element Theorem** provides a powerful simplification: for any finite extension $F \subseteq K$ where the elements of $K$ are separable over $F$ (which is always true for fields of characteristic zero, like $\mathbb{Q}$), there exists a "[primitive element](@entry_id:154321)" $\gamma \in K$ such that $K = F(\gamma)$. In other words, any finite extension involving multiple [algebraic elements](@entry_id:153893) can be re-expressed as a [simple extension](@entry_id:152948).

To find a [primitive element](@entry_id:154321) for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i)$, we can test a linear combination of the adjoined elements. A common choice is $\gamma = \sqrt{2} + i$. To verify this works, we must show that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}+i)$ is the same field as $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i)$. We can do this by comparing degrees. The degree of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i):\mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i):\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})][\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}):\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \times 2 = 4$. If we can show that the minimal polynomial of $\gamma = \sqrt{2}+i$ has degree 4, then by the [tower law](@entry_id:150838), the two fields must be equal. We find this polynomial by algebraic manipulation:
$$\gamma = \sqrt{2} + i \implies \gamma - i = \sqrt{2}$$
$$(\gamma - i)^2 = 2 \implies \gamma^2 - 2i\gamma - 1 = 2 \implies \gamma^2 - 3 = 2i\gamma$$
$$(\gamma^2 - 3)^2 = (2i\gamma)^2 \implies \gamma^4 - 6\gamma^2 + 9 = -4\gamma^2$$
$$\gamma^4 - 2\gamma^2 + 9 = 0$$
The polynomial $p(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + 9$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, so it is the minimal polynomial of $\gamma$. Since its degree is 4, we have $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}+i):\mathbb{Q}] = 4$. As $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}+i) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i)$ and both have the same degree, the fields must be identical, confirming that $\sqrt{2}+i$ is a [primitive element](@entry_id:154321) [@problem_id:1821097].

#### Normality and Splitting Fields

An important question regarding a [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ generated by a root of an [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) $p(x)$ is whether the field also contains the *other* roots of $p(x)$. An extension with this property is called a **[normal extension](@entry_id:155744)**.

Consider the [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) $p(x) = x^3-2$. Its roots are $\sqrt[3]{2}$, $\sqrt[3]{2}\omega$, and $\sqrt[3]{2}\omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ is a complex cube root of unity. The [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ is a [subfield](@entry_id:155812) of the real numbers. It cannot contain the other two roots, which are complex. Thus, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ is not a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744).

In contrast, take the [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) $q(x) = x^2+5$. If we adjoin one root, $\alpha = i\sqrt{5}$, the other root is $-\alpha = -i\sqrt{5}$. Since $\mathbb{Q}(i\sqrt{5})$ is a field, it is closed under multiplication by $-1 \in \mathbb{Q}$, so it must contain $-i\sqrt{5}$. In this case, the [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) contains all roots of the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598). Indeed, all degree-2 extensions are normal.

Another example of a normal [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) comes from [cyclotomic polynomials](@entry_id:155668). The polynomial $\Phi_5(x) = x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. Its roots are the primitive 5th [roots of unity](@entry_id:142597), which can be written as $\zeta, \zeta^2, \zeta^3, \zeta^4$ for a single primitive root $\zeta$. If we form the [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$, the other roots are simply powers of $\zeta$ and are therefore already in the field by closure under multiplication [@problem_id:1821141].

#### Limitations of Simple Extensions

Finally, we must recognize the limits of this concept. Not every [algebraic extension](@entry_id:155470) is a [simple extension](@entry_id:152948). A simple [algebraic extension](@entry_id:155470) $F(\gamma)$ must be a finite extension, with degree equal to that of the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) of $\gamma$. This raises a question: what about a field containing *all* [algebraic numbers](@entry_id:150888)?

Let $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ be the field of all complex numbers that are algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$. Could this field be a [simple extension](@entry_id:152948), $\overline{\mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{Q}(\gamma)$ for some "universal" [algebraic number](@entry_id:156710) $\gamma$? The answer is no. If it were, its degree $[\overline{\mathbb{Q}}:\mathbb{Q}]$ would be a finite integer $d$. However, for any integer $n > 0$, the polynomial $x^n - 2$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion. Its root, $\sqrt[n]{2}$, is an [algebraic number](@entry_id:156710) and thus lies in $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. This implies that for every $n$, $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ contains a [subfield](@entry_id:155812) $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{2})$ of degree $n$. By the Tower Law, the degree of any sub-extension must divide the degree of the total extension. This would mean that $n$ must divide $d$ for all positive integers $n$. This is impossible; we can simply choose $n = d+1$. This contradiction shows that the degree of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ must be infinite. Since any simple [algebraic extension](@entry_id:155470) is finite, $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ cannot be a [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) [@problem_id:1821142].

Similarly, if the base field $F$ is **algebraically closed**, meaning every polynomial in $F[x]$ already has a root in $F$, then the situation becomes trivial. The field of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ is the canonical example. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed. Therefore, the only [irreducible polynomials](@entry_id:152257) over $\mathbb{C}$ are those of degree 1. If $\alpha$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{C}$, its [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) must be of the form $x-c$ for some $c \in \mathbb{C}$. This implies $\alpha=c$, meaning $\alpha$ was already in $\mathbb{C}$ to begin with. Thus, adjoining any [algebraic element](@entry_id:149440) to an [algebraically closed field](@entry_id:151401) does not produce a new, larger field: $\mathbb{C}(\alpha) = \mathbb{C}$ [@problem_id:1821167].
