Any polynomial $f\\in\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ with $f(\\alpha)=0$ is necessarily a multiple of the minimal polynomial, and its degree can be arbitrarily large without conveying any new information about $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$.

The theorem states that if a rational number $p/q$ (in lowest terms) is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients, then the numerator $p$ must be a divisor of the constant term and the denominator $q$ must be a divisor of the leading coefficient.\nFor $P(x) = x^3 - 6x + 2$:\nThe constant term is 2.
