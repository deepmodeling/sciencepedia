A famous candidate for such a counterexample is the trisection of a $60^\\circ$ angle.\n\nFirst, we verify if the angle $\\theta = 60^\\circ$ is constructible. According to the definition provided, an angle is constructible if its cosine is a constructible number. For $\\theta = 60^\\circ$, we have $\\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}$. The number $\\frac{1}{2}$ is a rational number, so it belongs to the field $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\frac{1}{2})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\frac{1}{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}:\\mathbb{Q}] = 1$. Since $1 = 2^0$, the degree is a power of 2. By the theorem stated in the problem, $\\cos(60^\\circ)$ is a constructible number, and therefore the angle $\\theta = 60^\\circ$ is constructible.\n\nNext, we investigate the constructibility of the trisected angle, $\\alpha = \\theta/3 = 60^\\circ/3 = 20^\\circ$. For this angle to be constructible, the number $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ must be a constructible number. To check this, we must find the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which will give us the degree of the field extension $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\cos(20^\\circ)):\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n\nWe use the cosine triple-angle identity: $\\cos(3\\alpha) = 4\\cos^3(\\alpha) - 3\\cos(\\alpha)$.\nLet $\\alpha = 20^\\circ$. Then $3\\alpha = 60^\\circ$. Substituting these values into the identity gives:\n$\\cos(60^\\circ) = 4\\cos^3(20^\\circ) - 3\\cos(20^\\circ)$\n\nWe know that $\\cos(60^\\circ) = 1/2$. Let $x = \\cos(20^\\circ)$. The equation becomes:\n$\\frac{1}{2} = 4x^3 - 3x$\nMultiplying by 2 and rearranging the terms gives a polynomial equation for $x$:\n$1 = 8x^3 - 6x$\n$8x^3 - 6x - 1 = 0$\n\nSo, $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ is a root of the polynomial $P(x) = 8x^3 - 6x - 1$. To find the degree of the minimal extension, we must check if this polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If it is, then it is the minimal polynomial for $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ (up to a constant factor), and the degree of the extension will be 3.\n\nWe use the Rational Root Theorem to check for rational roots. Any rational root of $P(x)$ must be of the form $p/q$, where $p$ is an integer divisor of the constant term $(-1)$ and $q$ is an integer divisor of the leading coefficient (8).\nThe possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{1}{4}, \\pm \\frac{1}{8}$.\nWe test these possibilities:\n$P(1) = 8(1)^3 - 6(1) - 1 = 1 \\neq 0$\n$P(-1) = 8(-1)^3 - 6(-1) - 1 = -8 + 6 - 1 = -3 \\neq 0$\n$P(1/2) = 8(1/2)^3 - 6(1/2) - 1 = 8(1/8) - 3 - 1 = 1 - 3 - 1 = -3 \\neq 0$\n$P(-1/2) = 8(-1/2)^3 - 6(-1/2) - 1 = 8(-1/8) + 3 - 1 = -1 + 3 - 1 = 1 \\neq 0$\nSince none of the possible rational values are roots, the cubic polynomial $P(x) = 8x^3 - 6x - 1$ has no rational roots. A cubic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is irreducible if and only if it has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis means that $P(x)$ is the minimal polynomial for $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of this minimal polynomial is 3. Consequently, the degree of the field extension is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\cos(20^\\circ)):\\mathbb{Q}] = 3$.\n\nAccording to the constructibility theorem, a number is constructible only if the degree of its minimal extension is a power of 2. Since the degree is 3, which is not a power of 2, the number $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ is not constructible. This implies that the angle $20^\\circ$ is not constructible.\n\nWe have found a constructible angle ($\\theta = 60^\\circ$) for which the trisected angle ($\\theta/3 = 20^\\circ$) is not constructible. This serves as a direct counterexample to the student's claim, proving it to be false.\n\nLet's review the options:\n- A correctly identifies $\\theta = 60^\\circ$ as a counterexample and provides the correct reasoning based on the degree of the field extension for $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ being 3, which is not a power of 2.\n- B is incorrect because it makes a sweeping claim that no angle can be trisected. For instance, an angle of $90^\\circ$ is constructible, and its trisection, $30^\\circ$, is also constructible since $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3}/2$, and $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$, which is a power of 2.\n- C is incorrect because it misinterprets the field operations. Division by 3 in the field of constructible numbers would apply to a number like $\\cos(\\theta)$, resulting in $\\cos(\\theta)/3$, which is not the same as $\\cos(\\theta/3)$.\n- D is incorrect; the impossibility of a general trisection method is a proven mathematical fact, not a failure of insight.\n- E is incorrect as it uses a faulty counterexample. As shown in the analysis of B, $30^\\circ$ is a constructible angle, so $\\theta=90^\\circ$ is not a valid counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct assessment is given in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1802824"}, {"introduction": "To demonstrate the broad applicability of this algebraic method, our final exercise moves beyond well-known angles like $60^\\circ$ or $90^\\circ$.

To determine if $x$ is constructible, we need to find the degree of its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This involves checking if $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nA cubic polynomial with rational coefficients is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it has no rational roots. We can use the Rational Root Theorem to search for possible rational roots of $P(x)$. According to the theorem, if $p/q$ is a rational root in lowest terms, then $p$ must be an integer divisor of the constant term ($-3$), and $q$ must be an integer divisor of the leading coefficient (20).\n\nThe divisors of the constant term, $a_0 = -3$, are $p \\in \\{\\pm1, \\pm3\\}$.\nThe divisors of the leading coefficient, $a_3 = 20$, are $q \\in \\{1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20\\}$.\n\nThus, the set of all possible rational roots $p/q$ is:\n$$ \\left\\{ \\pm1, \\pm3, \\pm\\frac{1}{2}, \\pm\\frac{3}{2}, \\pm\\frac{1}{4}, \\pm\\frac{3}{4}, \\pm\\frac{1}{5}, \\pm\\frac{3}{5}, \\pm\\frac{1}{10}, \\pm\\frac{3}{10}, \\pm\\frac{1}{20}, \\pm\\frac{3}{20} \\right\\} $$\nWe can test these values to see if any of them is a root of $P(x) = 20x^3 - 15x - 3$.\n_Note on the range of the root_: Since $\\theta$ is an acute angle, $0 < \\theta < \\pi/2$. This implies $0 < \\theta/3 < \\pi/6$. Thus, for the root $x = \\cos(\\theta/3)$, we must have $\\cos(\\pi/6) < x < \\cos(0)$, which means $\\sqrt{3}/2 < x < 1$. Numerically, this is approximately $0.866 < x < 1$. None of the possible rational roots listed above fall into this range, so the specific root $x = \\cos(\\theta/3)$ is not rational.

Therefore, the polynomial $P(x) = 20x^3 - 15x - 3$ has no rational roots.\n\nSince $P(x)$ is a cubic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with no rational roots, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means that $P(x)$ is the minimal polynomial for its roots, including $x = \\cos(\\theta/3)$. The degree of the minimal polynomial is 3.\n\nThe degree of the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\cos(\\theta/3))$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial, so $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\cos(\\theta/3)) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 3$.\n\nFor a number to be constructible, the degree of its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must be a power of 2 (i.e., $2^k$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$). Since the degree is 3, which is not a power of 2, the number $\\cos(\\theta/3)$ is not a constructible number.\n\nConclusion: Because $\\cos(\\theta/3)$ is not constructible, the angle $\\theta$ such that $\\cos(\\theta)=3/5$ is not trisectible using only a compass and straightedge.\n\nThis eliminates option A. It confirms option B. Option C is incorrect as the problem is decidable. Option D is a false generalization; for example, the angle $\\phi=60^\\circ$ has $\\cos(\\phi)=1/2$ (a rational number) but is not trisectible, as this would imply the constructibility of $\\cos(20^\\circ)$, which is a root of the irreducible cubic $8x^3 - 6x - 1 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the angle is not trisectible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1802846"}]}
