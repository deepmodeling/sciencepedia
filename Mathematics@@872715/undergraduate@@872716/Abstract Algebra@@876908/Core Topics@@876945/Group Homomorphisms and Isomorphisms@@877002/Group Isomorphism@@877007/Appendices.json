An isomorphism is a map that is a homomorphism, injective, and surjective.\n\n**Statement A: $\\phi$ is a group homomorphism.**\nA map $\\phi$ is a group homomorphism if for any two elements $x, y$ in the domain, $\\phi(x \\cdot y) = \\phi(x) \\cdot \\phi(y)$.\nLet $x = (g_1, g_2)$ and $y = (h_1, h_2)$ be two arbitrary elements in $G_1 \\times G_2$.\n\nFirst, we compute the product $x \\cdot y$ in $G_1 \\times G_2$ and then apply $\\phi$:\n$x \\cdot y = (g_1, g_2) \\cdot (h_1, h_2) = (g_1 h_1, g_2 h_2)$.\nApplying $\\phi$ to this result gives:\n$\\phi(x \\cdot y) = \\phi(g_1 h_1, g_2 h_2) = (g_2 h_2, g_1 h_1)$.\n\nNext, we apply $\\phi$ to $x$ and $y$ individually and then compute their product in the codomain $G_2 \\times G_1$:\n$\\phi(x) = \\phi(g_1, g_2) = (g_2, g_1)$.\n$\\phi(y) = \\phi(h_1, h_2) = (h_2, h_1)$.\nThe product in $G_2 \\times G_1$ is:\n$\\phi(x) \\cdot \\phi(y) = (g_2, g_1) \\cdot (h_2, h_1) = (g_2 h_2, g_1 h_1)$.\n\nComparing the two results, we see that $\\phi(x \\cdot y) = \\phi(x) \\cdot \\phi(y)$. This holds for any groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, regardless of their properties (e.g., abelian or not). Therefore, $\\phi$ is a group homomorphism.\nStatement A is true.\n\n**Statement B: $\\phi$ is injective (one-to-one).**\nA map $\\phi$ is injective if $\\phi(x) = \\phi(y)$ implies $x = y$.\nLet $x = (g_1, g_2)$ and $y = (h_1, h_2)$ be in $G_1 \\times G_2$. Assume $\\phi(x) = \\phi(y)$.\n$\\phi(g_1, g_2) = \\phi(h_1, h_2)$.\nBy the definition of $\\phi$, this means:\n$(g_2, g_1) = (h_2, h_1)$.\nFor two ordered pairs to be equal, their corresponding components must be equal. So, we must have:\n$g_2 = h_2$ and $g_1 = h_1$.\nThis implies that the original elements are equal: $(g_1, g_2) = (h_1, h_2)$, which means $x = y$.\nTherefore, $\\phi$ is injective.\nStatement B is true.\n\n**Statement C: $\\phi$ is surjective (onto).**\nA map $\\phi$ is surjective if for any element $z$ in the codomain, there exists an element $x$ in the domain such that $\\phi(x) = z$.\nLet $z = (g_2, g_1)$ be an arbitrary element in the codomain $G_2 \\times G_1$, where $g_2 \\in G_2$ and $g_1 \\in G_1$.\nWe need to find an element $x = (h_1, h_2) \\in G_1 \\times G_2$ such that $\\phi(x) = z$.\n$\\phi(h_1, h_2) = (h_2, h_1)$.\nWe set this equal to $z$:\n$(h_2, h_1) = (g_2, g_1)$.\nThis implies $h_2 = g_2$ and $h_1 = g_1$.\nSo, the element $x = (g_1, g_2)$ is in the domain $G_1 \\times G_2$, and $\\phi(g_1, g_2) = (g_2, g_1) = z$.\nSince we can find a pre-image for any element in the codomain, $\\phi$ is surjective.\nStatement C is true.\n\n**Summary for A, B, C:**\nSince $\\phi$ is a homomorphism (A), injective (B), and surjective (C), it is a group isomorphism for any choice of groups $G_1$ and $G_2$. The direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ is always isomorphic to $G_2 \\times G_1$.\n\n**Statement D: $\\phi$ is an isomorphism if and only if $G_1$ is isomorphic to $G_2$.**\nThis is a biconditional statement. We analyze both directions.\n($\\Rightarrow$) \"If $\\phi$ is an isomorphism, then $G_1$ is isomorphic to $G_2$.\"\nAs established above, $\\phi$ is always an isomorphism. So this implication means that for any two groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, it must be that $G_1 \\cong G_2$. This is false. Consider the counterexample $G_1 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2) and $G_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_3$ (the cyclic group of order 3). They are not isomorphic because they have different orders. Yet, $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is an isomorphism. So, this direction is false.\nSince one direction is false, the \"if and only if\" statement is false.\nStatement D is false.\n\n**Statement E: $\\phi$ is an isomorphism if and only if at least one of the groups $G_1$ or $G_2$ is abelian.**\nThis is also a biconditional statement.\n($\\Rightarrow$) \"If $\\phi$ is an isomorphism, then at least one of $G_1$ or $G_2$ is abelian.\"\nAgain, $\\phi$ is always an isomorphism. This implication means that for any two groups, at least one must be abelian. This is false. Consider the counterexample where $G_1 = S_3$ and $G_2 = S_3$, the symmetric group on 3 elements. Neither group is abelian. Yet, the swap map $\\phi: S_3 \\times S_3 \\to S_3 \\times S_3$ is an isomorphism. So, this direction is false.\nThe entire \"if and only if\" statement is therefore false.\nStatement E is false.\n\nIn conclusion, statements A, B, and C are the only ones that are necessarily true for any pair of groups $G_1$ and $G_2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "1613488"}, {"introduction": "Beyond verifying definitions, the power of isomorphisms lies in their application.
