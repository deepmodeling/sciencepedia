So, $(x, y) \\in S$.\nBy the definition of the projection set $\\pi_1(S)$, since $(x, y) \\in S$, the first component $x$ must be an element of $\\pi_1(S)$.

So, $y \\in \\pi_2(S)$.\nNow, consider the Cartesian product $\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$. By definition, this set consists of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a \\in \\pi_1(S)$ and $b \\in \\pi_2(S)$.\nSince we have established that $x \\in \\pi_1(S)$ and $y \\in \\pi_2(S)$, the pair $(x, y)$ meets the criteria for membership in this Cartesian product. Thus, $(x, y) \\in \\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$.\nSince our choice of $(x, y)$ was an arbitrary element of $S$, we have shown that every element of $S$ is also an element of $\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$. Therefore, the inclusion $S \\subseteq \\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$ is always true.\n\nNext, let's examine if the reverse inclusion, $\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S) \\subseteq S$, is always true. We can test this by attempting to construct a counterexample.\nLet $A = \\{1, 2\\}$ and $B = \\{\\text{'p'}, \\text{'q'}\\}$.\nLet's choose a subset $S$ of $A \\times B$.

Likewise, $(2, \\text{'p'}) \\in \\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$ but $(2, \\text{'p'}) \\notin S$.\nThis demonstrates that $\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$ is not a subset of $S$ in this case.

The counterexample shows an instance where the inclusion is proper.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. $S = \\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$ is always true.
