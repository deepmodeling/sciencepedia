For either type, a shift can be applied in the positive (increase) or negative (decrease) direction.

Let $x$ be the number of Type A transitions (absorptions) and $y$ be the number of Type B transitions (emissions).

Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n$$ 9x\\mathcal{E}_0 - 12y\\mathcal{E}_0 = 21\\mathcal{E}_0 $$\nSince $\\mathcal{E}_0$ is a fundamental unit of energy and is non-zero, we can divide the entire equation by $\\mathcal{E}_0$ to obtain a linear Diophantine equation, where $x$ and $y$ must be integers:\n$$ 9x - 12y = 21 $$\nA linear Diophantine equation of the form $ax+by=c$ has integer solutions if and only if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $a$ and $b$, denoted $\\gcd(a,b)$, divides $c$. In our case, $a=9$, $b=-12$, and $c=21$.\nFirst, we find the GCD of the coefficients:\n$$ \\gcd(9, -12) = \\gcd(9, 12) = 3 $$\nNext, we check if this GCD divides the constant term $c=21$. Since $21 = 3 \\times 7$, the GCD does divide $c$, which confirms that integer solutions exist.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can simplify the equation by dividing all terms by $\\gcd(9, 12) = 3$:\n$$ (9x - 12y = 21) \\div 3 \\implies 3x - 4y = 7 $$\nNow we need to find one particular integer solution $(x_0, y_0)$ to this simplified equation. We can find this by inspection. Let's test small integer values for $x$. If $x=1$, $3(1)-4y=7 \\implies -4y=4 \\implies y=-1$. So, $(x_0, y_0) = (1, -1)$ is a particular solution. Let's check: $3(1) - 4(-1) = 3+4=7$.\n\nThe general integer solution for an equation $a'x + b'y = c'$ (where $a'$ and $b'$ are coprime) is given by:\n$$ x = x_0 + k \\cdot b' $$\n$$ y = y_0 - k \\cdot (-a') = y_0 + k \\cdot a' $$\nfor any integer $k$. In our simplified equation $3x - 4y = 7$, we have $a'=3$, $b'=-4$, and $(x_0, y_0) = (1, -1)$. So the general solution is:\n$$ x = 1 + k(-4) = 1 - 4k $$\n$$ y = -1 + k(3) = -1 + 3k $$\nHowever, the physical constraints of the problem require that $x$ and $y$ must be non-negative integers, representing the counts of transitions. So we must have $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$.\nApplying these constraints to our general solution:\n1. $x \\ge 0 \\implies 1 - 4k \\ge 0 \\implies 1 \\ge 4k \\implies k \\le \\frac{1}{4}$\n2. $y \\ge 0 \\implies -1 + 3k \\ge 0 \\implies 3k \\ge 1 \\implies k \\ge \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSo, the integer $k$ must satisfy $\\frac{1}{3} \\le k \\le \\frac{1}{4}$. There are no integers in this interval. This indicates a mistake was made in deriving the general solution form. Let's use the standard form:\nFor $a'x+b'y=c'$, the general solution is $x = x_0 + k \\frac{b'}{\\gcd(a',b')}$ and $y = y_0 - k \\frac{a'}{\\gcd(a',b')}$.\nFor $3x - 4y = 7$, $a'=3, b'=-4, \\gcd(3,-4)=1$.\nSo, $x = 1 + k(-4) = 1-4k$ and $y = -1 - k(3) = -1-3k$.\nLet's apply the non-negativity constraints again with this form:\n1. $x \\ge 0 \\implies 1-4k \\ge 0 \\implies 1 \\ge 4k \\implies k \\le \\frac{1}{4}$\n2. $y \\ge 0 \\implies -1-3k \\ge 0 \\implies -1 \\ge 3k \\implies k \\le -\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nBoth conditions must be satisfied. The stricter condition is $k \\le -1/3$. Since $k$ must be an integer, the possible values for $k$ are $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$.\n\nTo make this parameterization more intuitive, let's introduce a new integer parameter $t \\ge 0$. Let $t = -k - 1$. Since the most positive value of $k$ is $-1$, the least value of $t$ is $-(-1)-1=0$. Thus, $t$ can be any non-negative integer ($t=0, 1, 2, \\dots$).\nFrom $t = -k-1$, we have $k = -t - 1$. Substituting this back into the expressions for $x$ and $y$:\n$$ x(t) = 1 - 4(-t-1) = 1 + 4t + 4 = 5 + 4t $$\n$$ y(t) = -1 - 3(-t-1) = -1 + 3t + 3 = 2 + 3t $$\nSo, all valid non-negative integer pairs $(x,y)$ are given by $(5+4t, 2+3t)$ for $t = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nThe problem asks for the pair $(x,y)$ that minimizes the total number of transitions, $S = x+y$.\nLet's express $S$ as a function of our new parameter $t$:\n$$ S(t) = x(t) + y(t) = (5+4t) + (2+3t) = 7 + 7t $$\nTo minimize $S(t)$, we must choose the smallest possible value for $t$. Since $t$ must be a non-negative integer, the minimum value is $t=0$.\nSubstituting $t=0$ into our expressions for $x$ and $y$:\n$$ x = 5 + 4(0) = 5 $$\n$$ y = 2 + 3(0) = 2 $$\nThe pair corresponding to the minimum number of transitions is $(5, 2)$. The minimum number of transitions is $S(0) = 7+7(0) = 7$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 5  2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1381615"}, {"introduction": "Linear Diophantine equations can do more than just find solutions; they can also define the boundaries of what is possible.

The process is controlled by a machine that can perform two fundamental operations:\n\n1.  Deposit a cluster of 5 atoms of type A. This operation takes a fixed amount of time.\n2.  Deposit a cluster of 7 atoms of type B. This operation also takes a fixed amount of time.\n\nThe machine can also run these operations in reverse, removing the corresponding number of atoms. A 'program' consists of running the type A operation $x$ times and the type B operation $y$ times. The integers $x$ and $y$ can be positive (deposition), negative (removal), or zero.

Express your answer as an integer.", "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of times the type A operation is performed, and $y$ be the number of times the type B operation is performed. The net number of atoms added is given by the linear equation:\n$$N = 5x + 7y$$\n\nThe problem asks for the largest integer $N_{max}$ that satisfies two conditions:\n1.  There exist integer solutions $(x, y)$ to the equation $N_{max} = 5x + 7y$.\n2.  There are no non-negative integer solutions to the equation $N_{max} = 5x + 7y$, meaning there is no pair of integers $(x, y)$ such that $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the first condition. A linear Diophantine equation of the form $ax + by = c$ has integer solutions for $(x, y)$ if and only if the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$, denoted $\\gcd(a, b)$, divides $c$. In our case, $a=5$ and $b=7$. Their greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(5, 7) = 1$, as they are relatively prime. Since 1 divides any integer $N$, a 'valid' program exists for any integer target $N$.\n\nThe problem thus simplifies to finding the largest integer $N$ for which the equation $5x + 7y = N$ has no solutions in non-negative integers ($x \\ge 0, y \\ge 0$). This is a classic problem in number theory related to the Frobenius Coin Problem. For two relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, the largest integer that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$ is called the Frobenius number, given by the formula:\n$$g(a, b) = ab - a - b$$\n\nIn our problem, $a=5$ and $b=7$. Applying this formula gives us $N_{max}$:\n$$N_{max} = g(5, 7) = (5)(7) - 5 - 7 = 35 - 12 = 23$$\n\nThus, 23 is the largest integer that can be formed by $5x + 7y$ with integer $x, y$ but not with non-negative integer $x, y$. To verify this, we first show that $N=23$ has no non-negative integer solutions. We test values for $y$:\n- If $y=0$, $5x=23$ (no integer solution for $x$).\n- If $y=1$, $5x=16$ (no integer solution for $x$).\n- If $y=2$, $5x=9$ (no integer solution for $x$).\n- If $y=3$, $5x=2$ (no integer solution for $x$).\n- If $y \\ge 4$, $7y \\ge 28$, which would require $5x$ to be negative, so $x  0$.\nHence, there are no non-negative integer solutions for $N=23$. However, an integer solution does exist because $\\gcd(5,7)=1$ divides 23. For example, since $5(3) + 7(-2) = 1$, we can multiply by 23 to get $5(69) + 7(-46) = 23$. So, a 'valid' program exists.\n\nFinally, we check that an integer greater than 23, such as $N=24$, does have a non-negative solution. For the equation $5x+7y = 24$, the pair $(x,y)=(2,2)$ is a non-negative solution, since $5(2)+7(2)=10+14=24$.
