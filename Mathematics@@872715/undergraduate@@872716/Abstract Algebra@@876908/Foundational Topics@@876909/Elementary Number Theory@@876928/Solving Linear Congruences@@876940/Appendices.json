We can do this by multiplying both sides of the congruence by the multiplicative inverse of 19 modulo 31. Let's denote this inverse as $19^{-1}$. The inverse exists if and only if the greatest common divisor of 19 and 31 is 1, i.e., $\\gcd(19, 31) = 1$. Since 31 is a prime number and 19 is not a multiple of 31, their greatest common divisor is indeed 1.\n\nWe can find the inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which allows us to express $\\gcd(19, 31)$ as a linear combination of 19 and 31, i.e., $19s + 31t = 1$. The integer $s$ will be the multiplicative inverse of 19 modulo 31.\n\nFirst, apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find $\\gcd(19, 31)$:\n$$31 = 1 \\cdot 19 + 12$$\n$$19 = 1 \\cdot 12 + 7$$\n$$12 = 1 \\cdot 7 + 5$$\n$$7 = 1 \\cdot 5 + 2$$\n$$5 = 2 \\cdot 2 + 1$$\nThe last non-zero remainder is 1, so $\\gcd(19, 31) = 1$.\n\nNow, we perform back-substitution to express 1 as a linear combination of 19 and 31:\nFrom the last equation:\n$$1 = 5 - 2 \\cdot 2$$\nSubstitute $2 = 7 - 1 \\cdot 5$:\n$$1 = 5 - 2(7 - 1 \\cdot 5) = 5 - 2 \\cdot 7 + 2 \\cdot 5 = 3 \\cdot 5 - 2 \\cdot 7$$\nSubstitute $5 = 12 - 1 \\cdot 7$:\n$$1 = 3(12 - 1 \\cdot 7) - 2 \\cdot 7 = 3 \\cdot 12 - 3 \\cdot 7 - 2 \\cdot 7 = 3 \\cdot 12 - 5 \\cdot 7$$\nSubstitute $7 = 19 - 1 \\cdot 12$:\n$$1 = 3 \\cdot 12 - 5(19 - 1 \\cdot 12) = 3 \\cdot 12 - 5 \\cdot 19 + 5 \\cdot 12 = 8 \\cdot 12 - 5 \\cdot 19$$\nSubstitute $12 = 31 - 1 \\cdot 19$:\n$$1 = 8(31 - 1 \\cdot 19) - 5 \\cdot 19 = 8 \\cdot 31 - 8 \\cdot 19 - 5 \\cdot 19$$\n$$1 = 8 \\cdot 31 - 13 \\cdot 19$$\nWe have the equation $8 \\cdot 31 - 13 \\cdot 19 = 1$.\nTaking this equation modulo 31, we get:\n$$(8 \\cdot 31 - 13 \\cdot 19) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$$\n$$(0 - 13 \\cdot 19) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$$\n$$-13 \\cdot 19 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$$\nThis shows that the multiplicative inverse of 19 modulo 31 is $-13$. To find the smallest positive inverse, we add the modulus:\n$$19^{-1} \\equiv -13 \\pmod{31} \\equiv -13 + 31 \\pmod{31} \\equiv 18 \\pmod{31}$$\nSo, the inverse of 19 modulo 31 is 18.\n\nNow we can solve the original congruence by multiplying both sides by 18:\n$$18 \\cdot (19x) \\equiv 18 \\cdot 23 \\pmod{31}$$\nBy the definition of the inverse, $18 \\cdot 19 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$, so the left side becomes $1 \\cdot x$:\n$$x \\equiv 18 \\cdot 23 \\pmod{31}$$\nNow we compute the product $18 \\cdot 23$:\n$$18 \\cdot 23 = 414$$\nSo, we have:\n$$x \\equiv 414 \\pmod{31}$$\nTo find the smallest positive value for $x$, we need to find the remainder of the division of 414 by 31.\n$$414 \\div 31$$\n$31 \\times 10 = 310$. $414 - 310 = 104$.\n$31 \\times 3 = 93$. $104 - 93 = 11$.\nSo, $414 = 13 \\cdot 31 + 11$.\nThe remainder is 11.\nTherefore, $x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{31}$.\n\nThe solutions for $x$ are of the form $x = 11 + 31k$ for any integer $k$. We are looking for the smallest positive integer solution. This occurs when we choose $k=0$.\nFor $k=0$, $x = 11 + 31(0) = 11$.\nThis is a positive integer. For any smaller integer value of $k$ (e.g., $k=-1$), $x$ would be negative. For any larger integer value of $k$ (e.g., $k=1$), $x$ would be larger.
