We will test each of the three axioms.\n\n**Testing Axiom 1: $X \\in \\mathcal{F}$?**\nThe first axiom requires the entire set $X$ to be in the collection $\\mathcal{F}$.\nHere, $X = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. We need to check if $X$ satisfies the condition for membership in $\\mathcal{F}$.\nThe condition is \"$1 \\in X$ or $2 \\notin X$\".\nThe first part of this logical 'or' statement, \"$1 \\in X$\", is true because $1$ is an element of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nSince at least one part of an 'or' statement is true, the entire statement is true.\nTherefore, $X$ satisfies the condition, and $X \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\nAxiom 1 is satisfied.\n\n**Testing Axiom 2: Closure under complementation**\nThe second axiom requires that if a set $A$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$, its complement $A^c = X \\setminus A$ must also be in $\\mathcal{F}$. To test this, we can try to find a counterexample: a set $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ for which $A^c \\notin \\mathcal{F}$.\n\nFor a complement $A^c$ to *not* be in $\\mathcal{F}$, it must fail the defining condition. That is, the statement \"$1 \\in A^c$ or $2 \\notin A^c$\" must be false. This happens only if both parts are false:\n$1 \\notin A^c$ AND $2 \\in A^c$.\n\nLet's translate this condition on $A^c$ back to a condition on the original set $A$:\nIf $1 \\notin A^c$, then $1 \\in A$.\nIf $2 \\in A^c$, then $2 \\notin A$.\nSo, we are looking for a set $A$ such that $1 \\in A$ and $2 \\notin A$.\n\nLet's choose the simplest such set: $A = \\{1\\}$.\nFirst, we must verify if this choice of $A$ is indeed in $\\mathcal{F}$. The condition for $A=\\{1\\}$ is \"$1 \\in \\{1\\}$ or $2 \\notin \\{1\\}$\". The first part, \"$1 \\in \\{1\\}$\", is true. Thus, $A = \\{1\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nNow, let's examine its complement, $A^c = X \\setminus A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus \\{1\\} = \\{2, 3, 4\\}$.\nWe must check if $A^c$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$. The condition for $A^c$ is \"$1 \\in A^c$ or $2 \\notin A^c$\".\n- Is $1 \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$? No, this is false.\n- Is $2 \\notin \\{2, 3, 4\\}$? No, this is also false because $2$ is an element of this set.\n\nSince both parts of the 'or' statement are false, the entire statement is false. This means $A^c = \\{2, 3, 4\\}$ does not satisfy the condition for membership in $\\mathcal{F}$.\nWe have found a set $A=\\{1\\}$ which is in $\\mathcal{F}$, but its complement $A^c$ is not in $\\mathcal{F}$.\nTherefore, Axiom 2 fails.\n\n**Testing Axiom 3: Closure under countable unions**\nThe third axiom requires that the union of any sequence of sets from $\\mathcal{F}$ is also in $\\mathcal{F}$. Let $A_1, A_2, \\dots$ be a sequence of sets, each belonging to $\\mathcal{F}$. Let $A = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} A_i$.\nFor each $A_i$, the condition \"$1 \\in A_i$ or $2 \\notin A_i$\" is true.\nWe now analyze two possible cases for this sequence of sets.\n\nCase 1: There exists at least one set, say $A_k$, in the sequence such that $1 \\in A_k$.\nIf $1 \\in A_k$ for some $k$, then by the definition of a union, $1$ is also in the final union $A = \\bigcup A_i$. The condition for $A$ to be in $\\mathcal{F}$ is \"$1 \\in A$ or $2 \\notin A$\". Since $1 \\in A$, this condition is met. Thus, $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n\nCase 2: For all sets $A_i$ in the sequence, $1 \\notin A_i$.\nIn this case, for the condition \"$1 \\in A_i$ or $2 \\notin A_i$\" to be true for each $A_i$, the second part must be true for all of them. That is, it must be that $2 \\notin A_i$ for all $i$.\nIf the element $2$ is not present in any of the sets $A_i$, it cannot be present in their union $A$. Therefore, $2 \\notin A$.\nThis satisfies the second part of the condition for $A$ to be in $\\mathcal{F}$ (\"$1 \\in A$ or $2 \\notin A$\"). Thus, $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n\nSince the union $A$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$ in all possible cases, the collection $\\mathcal{F}$ is closed under countable unions.\nAxiom 3 is satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOur analysis shows:\n- Axiom 1 is satisfied.\n- Axiom 2 fails.\n- Axiom 3 is satisfied.\nTherefore, only Axiom 2 fails for the given collection $\\mathcal{F}$.
