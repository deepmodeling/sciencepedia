The union is $A = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots\\}$. This set $A$ is countably infinite, not finite. Therefore, $A \\notin \\mathcal{C}_B$.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{C}_B$ is not closed under countable increasing unions, it is not a monotone class.\n\n**C. Analysis of $\\mathcal{C}_C$: The collection of all uncountable subsets of $X$, along with the empty set $\\emptyset$.**\n\n1.  **Closure under countable decreasing intersections:**\n    We test this condition with a counterexample. Let $X$ be an uncountable set. Since $X$ is uncountable, it contains at least a countably infinite subset. Let $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots\\}$ be a sequence of distinct elements in $X$. Define a decreasing sequence of sets $\\{B_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ by $B_n = X \\setminus \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{n-1}\\}$ for $n \\ge 1$ (with $B_1 = X$). The complement of each $B_n$ is a finite set $\\{x_1, ..., x_{n-1}\\}$. Since removing a finite number of elements from an uncountable set leaves an uncountable set, each $B_n$ is uncountable and thus $B_n \\in \\mathcal{C}_C$. The intersection is $B = \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n = X \\setminus \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots\\}$. The complement of $B$ in $X$ is a countably infinite set. Since $X$ is uncountable, $B$ must also be uncountable. So this example doesn't work.\n\n    Let's construct a different counterexample. Let $X = \\mathbb{R}$. For each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, define the set $B_n = (n, \\infty)$. Each $B_n$ is an interval of real numbers, which is an uncountable set. So, $B_n \\in \\mathcal{C}_C$. The sequence is decreasing since $(n+1, \\infty) \\subset (n, \\infty)$. The intersection of this sequence is $B = \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n$. For any real number $x$, there exists an integer $N > x$, so $x \\notin (N, \\infty)$. This means $x$ is not in a tail of the sequence of sets, and thus $x$ cannot be in the intersection. The intersection is the empty set, $B = \\emptyset$. By the definition provided, $\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{C}_C$. So this check passes.\n\n    Let's try one more counterexample. Let $X = \\mathbb{R}$. Let $q_1, q_2, \\dots$ be an enumeration of the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $B_n = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{q_1, \\dots, q_{n-1}\\}$. Each $B_n$ is uncountable. The intersection is $\\bigcap_n B_n = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$, the set of irrationals, which is uncountable. This also does not serve as a counterexample.\n\n    A successful counterexample: Let $X = \\mathbb{R}$. Let $B_n = [0, 1/n]$. Each $B_n$ is uncountable. This is a decreasing sequence. The intersection is $\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty [0, 1/n] = \\{0\\}$. The set $\\{0\\}$ is countable (specifically, finite), not uncountable, and it is not the empty set. Therefore, $\\{0\\} \\notin \\mathcal{C}_C$.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{C}_C$ is not closed under countable decreasing intersections, it is not a monotone class.\n\n**D. Analysis of $\\mathcal{C}_D$: The collection of subsets with a countable complement.**\n\nLet's call the complement of a set $E$ as $E^c = X \\setminus E$. So $\\mathcal{C}_D = \\{E \\subseteq X \\mid E^c \\text{ is countable}\\}$.\n\n1.  **Closure under countable increasing unions:**\n    Let $\\{A_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ be an increasing sequence of sets in $\\mathcal{C}_D$. This means each $A_n^c$ is countable. The sequence of complements $\\{A_n^c\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is a decreasing sequence ($A_1 \\subseteq A_2 \\implies A_1^c \\supseteq A_2^c$). Let $A = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n$. By De Morgan's laws, the complement of the union is the intersection of the complements: $A^c = \\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\right)^c = \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n^c$. This intersection is a subset of $A_1^c$. Since $A_1^c$ is countable, its subset $A^c$ must also be countable. Therefore, $A \\in \\mathcal{C}_D$.\n\n2.  **Closure under countable decreasing intersections:**\n    Let $\\{B_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ be a decreasing sequence of sets in $\\mathcal{C}_D$. This means each $B_n^c$ is countable. The sequence of complements $\\{B_n^c\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is an increasing sequence ($B_1 \\supseteq B_2 \\implies B_1^c \\subseteq B_2^c$). Let $B = \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n$. By De Morgan's laws, the complement of the intersection is the union of the complements: $B^c = \\left(\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n\\right)^c = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n^c$. The union is a countable union of countable sets, which is itself a countable set. So $B^c$ is countable. Therefore, $B \\in \\mathcal{C}_D$.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{C}_D$ satisfies both conditions, it is a monotone class.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe collections $\\mathcal{C}_A$ and $\\mathcal{C}_D$ are monotone classes.

Let $A = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n$. To show $A$ is an interval, take any $x, y \\in A$ with $x  y$, and any $z$ with $x  z  y$. Since $x, y \\in A$, there exist $n_x, n_y$ such that $x \\in A_{n_x}$ and $y \\in A_{n_y}$. Let $N = \\max(n_x, n_y)$. Since the sequence is increasing, $A_{n_x} \\subseteq A_N$ and $A_{n_y} \\subseteq A_N$, so both $x, y \\in A_N$. Since $A_N$ is an interval, it must be that $z \\in A_N$. Thus $z \\in A$.

Take any $x, y \\in B$ with $x  y$, and any $z$ with $x  z  y$. Since $x, y \\in B$, it means $x, y \\in B_n$ for all $n$. As each $B_n$ is an interval, it must be that $z \\in B_n$ for all $n$.

No. For example, $1 \\in A \\Delta B$ and $2 \\in A \\Delta B$, but the point $1.5$, which is between 1 and 2, is not in $A \\Delta B$.\n  - Therefore, $A \\Delta B \\notin \\mathcal{D}$, and the collection is not closed under symmetric difference.\n  - Since $\\mathcal{D}$ is a monotone class but is not closed under symmetric difference, it is a valid counterexample.\n\n**Option E: $\\mathcal{E}$, the collection of all Borel sets of $\\mathbb{R}$**\n- Is it a monotone class?\n  - A $\\sigma$-algebra is, by definition, closed under countable unions and complements. Closure under complements and countable unions implies closure under countable intersections (via De Morgan's laws: $\\bigcap A_n = (\\bigcup A_n^c)^c$). An increasing union is a countable union. A decreasing intersection is a countable intersection. Thus, any $\\sigma$-algebra is a monotone class. So $\\mathcal{E}$ is a monotone class.\n- Is it closed under symmetric difference?\n  - Let $A, B$ be Borel sets. A $\\sigma$-algebra is also an algebra, meaning it's closed under finite unions and complements.\n  - $A \\Delta B = (A \\cap B^c) \\cup (B \\cap A^c)$.\n  - Since $A, B \\in \\mathcal{E}$, their complements $A^c, B^c \\in \\mathcal{E}$.\n  - Since $\\mathcal{E}$ is closed under (finite) intersections, $A \\cap B^c \\in \\mathcal{E}$ and $B \\cap A^c \\in \\mathcal{E}$.\n  - Since $\\mathcal{E}$ is closed under (finite) unions, their union $(A \\cap B^c) \\cup (B \\cap A^c)$ is in $\\mathcal{E}$.\n  - So $\\mathcal{E}$ is closed under symmetric difference.
