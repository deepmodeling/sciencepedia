The theorem states that a solid ball can be decomposed into a finite number of disjoint point sets, which can then be reassembled to form two solid balls, each identical in size to the original. This reassembly is accomplished purely through rigid motions, meaning the pieces are only translated and rotated, not stretched, bent, or otherwise deformed. Two sets are said to be \"congruent\" if one can be transformed into the other by a rigid motion (an isometry).\n\nBased on this description of the paradox, which of the following statements is a logically correct conclusion?\n\nA.

Claim: There exists a proper subset $S \\subsetneq B$ that is congruent to $B$. If $S$ were congruent to $B$, then there exists an isometry $g$ with $g(B)=S$. Since any isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ maps a ball to a ball of the same radius, $g(B)$ is a ball of the same radius as $B$. If $g(B) \\subseteq B$ and both have the same radius, then necessarily $g(B)=B$ (a ball of radius $r$ cannot be a proper subset of another ball of radius $r$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$). Hence $S$ cannot be a proper subset. Therefore A is false.\n\nB. Claim: $B$ can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets, each congruent to $B$. If $B=S_1 \\sqcup S_2$ with each $S_i$ congruent to $B$, then there exist isometries $g_i$ with $g_i(B)=S_i$. Thus each $S_i$ is itself a ball of the same radius as $B$, disjoint and contained in $B$. This is impossible because two disjoint balls of radius equal to that of $B$ cannot both be contained in $B$. Therefore B is false.\n\nC. Claim: $B$ can be partitioned into finitely many disjoint pieces that can be sorted into two collections; neither collection, as a subset of $B$, is congruent to $B$, but each collection can be reassembled via rigid motions to form a ball congruent to $B$. This is precisely what the Banach-Tarski paradox asserts: there exist pieces $P_1,\\dots,P_n$ and isometries so that the pieces can be rigidly moved and grouped to produce two copies of a ball congruent to $B$. The statement explicitly does not require that either collection, before reassembly, be congruent to $B$ as a subset of $B$. Therefore C correctly captures the theorem’s conclusion.\n\nD. Claim: The paradox is invalid for physical objects because it requires decomposing the ball into pieces that all have zero volume. The theorem is a result in set theory and geometric group theory, not a claim about physical feasibility. Moreover, the pieces are non-measurable (not all of zero Lebesgue measure in any well-defined sense); asserting they all have zero volume is inaccurate.

This practice explores the rigorous justification for this maneuver, which lies in the realm of measure theory. You will see how the concept of a \"set of measure zero\" allows mathematicians to disregard a countably infinite number of points without affecting the volume, a crucial step for the paradoxical decomposition to proceed [@problem_id:1446554].", "problem": "In a common construction for the Banach-Tarski paradox, one considers the group of rotations in three-dimensional space, $SO(3)$. It is possible to find two specific rotations, which we can call $A$ and $B$, such that the group $G$ generated by them is a free group. This group $G$ acts on the surface of the unit sphere, $S^2$.\n\nLet $P$ be the set of \"poles\" on $S^2$, defined as the set of all points $x \\in S^2$ such that for some non-identity rotation $g \\in G$, we have $g(x) = x$. This set $P$ is countably infinite. The first step of the construction partitions the sphere *without* these poles, i.e., the set $S^2 \\setminus P$. This partitioning is then used to enact the paradox for the entire solid unit ball. The paradox concludes that the ball can be reassembled into two copies of itself, seemingly doubling its volume. For this conclusion to hold, one must justify why ignoring the set of poles $P$ at the start is permissible.\n\nThe volume of a set in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is formally defined by its three-dimensional Lebesgue measure. A key property of the Lebesgue measure is its countable sub-additivity, which states that for any countable collection of sets $E_1, E_2, \\dots$, the measure of their union is less than or equal to the sum of their individual measures: $\\mu(\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} E_i) \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\mu(E_i)$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the rigorous mathematical reason why the set of poles $P$ (and the corresponding radial lines inside the ball) can be disregarded without affecting the volumetric conclusion of the paradox?\n\nA. The set $P$ is rotationally symmetric with respect to the group $G$, meaning that if a point $p$ is in $P$, then $g(p)$ is also in $P$ for any rotation $g \\in G$. This symmetry ensures it can be ignored.\nB. Since the set $P$ is countable, the Axiom of Choice, which is used to construct the paradoxical pieces, also guarantees that such countable sets can be added or removed without logical contradiction.\nC. The set $P$ is a dense subset of the sphere $S^2$. In measure theory, dense sets do not contribute to the total volume and can be ignored.\nD. The points in $P$ are fixed points for certain rotations, and therefore return to their original positions after the reassembly transformations, meaning they do not contribute to the \"duplication\" effect.\nE. Any countable set of points on the sphere $S^2$, such as $P$, corresponds to a set of radial lines within the ball that has a total three-dimensional Lebesgue measure of zero. Removing a set of measure zero does not change the volume of the original ball.", "solution": "We work with the three-dimensional Lebesgue measure $\\mu_3$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$.

The rigorous justification relies on measure-theoretic null sets and countable sub-additivity: the set of poles $P$ is countable, the associated radial set $L$ is a countable union of measure-zero lines, hence $\\mu_3(L)=0$, and removing $L$ does not affect the ball’s volume. This is exactly captured by option E. Options A, B, C, and D do not provide the measure-theoretic reason: symmetry (A) does not imply measure zero, the Axiom of Choice (B) does not address invariance of Lebesgue measure under removing sets, density (C) neither holds here nor implies zero measure, and fixed-point behavior (D) does not address volumetric invariance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1446554"}, {"introduction": "While the rotations used in the paradox have many fixed points, the origin is unique in that it is fixed by *all* of them, presenting a special challenge: how can an unmovable point be duplicated?

A key part of the standard construction involves a set of rotations about axes passing through the center of the ball, which we denote as the origin $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nA conceptual issue arises: the origin $\\mathcal{O}$ is a fixed point for all these rotations. If $\\mathcal{O}$ belongs to a piece $A_k$ of the partition, any rotation applied to $A_k$ will leave $\\mathcal{O}$ in its original position. This seems to imply that the origin cannot be duplicated to appear in the center of both new balls.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct resolution to this apparent contradiction?\n\nA. The decomposition is applied not to the entire ball $B$, but to the ball with a countable set of \"problematic\" points removed, $B \\setminus P$, where $P$ contains the origin and all other fixed points of the rotation group. This yields two copies of $B \\setminus P$. The countable set $P$ is then handled separately using a procedure analogous to the Hilbert's Hotel paradox, allowing the original points from $P$ to be rearranged to fill the holes in both new balls.\nB. The pieces of the decomposition are non-measurable, and as such, they do not have a well-defined volume. This property also implies that a single point within them, like the origin, does not have a well-defined position, allowing it to be mapped to multiple locations simultaneously.\nC. The Axiom of Choice, which is necessary for the paradox, allows for the creation of sets with properties that violate classical geometry. One such property is that the piece containing the origin can be mapped by a single rigid motion onto a new set that contains two points corresponding to the centers of the new balls.\nD. In the context of the abstract group theory used to prove the paradox, the \"rotations\" are symbolic isometries that do not necessarily correspond to physical rotations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The concept of a fixed \"origin\" is a simplification that does not hold in the formal proof.\nE. The origin is a set of measure zero and is therefore discarded before the decomposition.

One constructs pieces of $S^2 \\setminus P_S$ which can be reassembled into two copies of $S^2 \\setminus P_S$. Radially extending these sets yields a paradoxical decomposition of $B\\setminus P$ into finitely many pieces which, under finitely many rotations about the origin, produce two copies of $B\\setminus P$.\n\nThis directly resolves the “fixed origin” issue during the main construction, because the origin $0\\in P$ is removed and hence never needs to be moved by any rotation.\n\nIt remains to restore the countable set $P$ to obtain two exact copies of the full ball $B$. The paradoxical decomposition yields two disjoint sets, $C_1$ and $C_2$, each a copy of the \"punctured\" ball $B \\setminus P$. To complete them into full balls, we need to fill their corresponding \"holes,\" which are sets of points $H_1$ and $H_2$, each isometric to $P$. The set of points we have available is the original set $P$. Since $P$, $H_1$, and $H_2$ are all countably infinite, their union $H_1 \\cup H_2$ is also countably infinite. A bijection $\\phi: P \\to H_1 \\cup H_2$ must exist. This is the essence of the Hilbert's Hotel argument: a countably infinite set of \"available points\" ($P$) can perfectly fill a countably infinite set of \"holes\" ($H_1 \\cup H_2$). We use this bijection to place the points from $P$ (including the origin) into the holes, thereby constructing two complete balls, each congruent to the original.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A accurately describes the standard resolution: remove a countable set $P$ (including the origin and all fixed points of nontrivial group elements), perform the paradoxical decomposition on $B\\setminus P$ to obtain two copies of $B\\setminus P$, then use a Hilbert’s Hotel style handling of the countable set to fill the holes in both copies.\n- B is incorrect: non-measurability concerns the absence of a well-defined volume, not the “position” of points; rigid motions are bijections and cannot send a single point to multiple locations.\n- C is incorrect: a single rigid motion is a bijection and cannot map one point to two points.\n- D is incorrect: the proof uses actual isometries of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (rotations and translations), not merely symbolic ones; fixed points such as the origin are genuine in the formal proof and are treated as above.\n- E is misleading/incorrect in this context: the theorem asserts equidecomposition into exact congruent copies, not merely up to sets of measure zero; the standard construction explicitly repairs the removed countable set rather than discarding it.\n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1446549"}]}
