We explore how to determine the precise scaling factor needed to alter the volume of a set in a high-dimensional space, a common task in fields like data science and machine learning. This practice helps build intuition for how volume behaves under uniform scaling, where the change is proportional to the scaling factor raised to the power of the dimension [@problem_id:1442671].", "problem": "A data scientist is preprocessing a dataset for a machine learning algorithm. The dataset consists of points in an $n$-dimensional feature space, which can be viewed as a set of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The convex hull of these data points forms a measurable set $S_0$ with a non-zero $n$-dimensional volume (Lebesgue measure), denoted as $V_0$. The scientist discovers that the algorithm's performance can be improved by uniformly scaling the feature space. This transformation maps every point vector $\\vec{x}$ to a new vector $\\vec{x}' = c\\vec{x}$, where $c$ is a positive, real-valued scaling factor. This transforms the original set $S_0$ into a new set $S_c$.\n\nThe goal is to choose a scaling factor $c$ such that the volume of the new set, $m(S_c)$, is precisely a desired multiple of the original volume. Specifically, the data is represented in a feature space of dimension $n=10$, and the desired volume of the transformed set is to be $380$ times the original volume.\n\nCalculate the required scaling factor $c$. Round your final answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let the original set of data points be represented by a measurable set $S_0 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$. The volume of this set is its Lebesgue measure, denoted by $m(S_0)$. We are given that $m(S_0) = V_0 > 0$.\n\nThe transformation applied to the feature space is a uniform scaling by a factor $c > 0$. This means every vector $\\vec{x} \\in S_0$ is mapped to a new vector $c\\vec{x}$. The resulting set is $S_c = \\{c\\vec{x} : \\vec{x} \\in S_0\\}$.\n\nThe scaling property of the Lebesgue measure in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ states that for any measurable set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ and any scalar $\\lambda$, the measure of the scaled set $\\lambda E$ is given by $m(\\lambda E) = |\\lambda|^n m(E)$.\n\nIn our problem, the scaling factor is $c$, which is given to be positive. Therefore, $|c| = c$. Applying this property to our set $S_0$, the measure of the new set $S_c$ is:\n$$m(S_c) = c^n m(S_0)$$\n\nThe problem requires that the new volume $m(S_c)$ be a specific multiple of the original volume $m(S_0)$. Let this multiplication factor be $k$. The condition is:\n$$m(S_c) = k \\cdot m(S_0)$$\n\nWe are given the values for the dimension $n$ and the desired multiplication factor $k$:\n$n = 10$\n$k = 380$\n\nNow, we can set the two expressions for $m(S_c)$ equal to each other:\n$$c^n m(S_0) = k \\cdot m(S_0)$$\n\nSince we are given that the original volume $V_0 = m(S_0)$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides of the equation by $m(S_0)$:\n$$c^n = k$$\n\nTo find the scaling factor $c$, we take the $n$-th root of both sides. Since $c$ must be positive, we only consider the positive real root:\n$$c = k^{1/n}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$c = 380^{1/10}$$\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can use a calculator:\n$$c = \\sqrt[10]{380} \\approx 1.811252...$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are 1, 8, 1, and 1. The fifth significant figure is 2, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the fourth significant figure).\n\nTherefore, the required scaling factor is $c \\approx 1.811$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.811}$$", "id": "1442671"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple uniform scaling, this problem investigates the effect of a general linear transformation on area in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.
