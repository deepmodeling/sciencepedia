We use the following properties, with explicit justifications as needed.\n\n1) Compute $\\lambda^{*}([0,1])$.\n- Upper bound: Since $[0,1]$ is covered by the single open interval $(-\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\tfrac{3}{2})$ (or by $(0,1)$ with an arbitrarily small enlargement), we have $\\lambda^{*}([0,1]) \\le 1$ because we can cover $[0,1]$ by itself as a closed interval with length $1$ in the defining infimum over coverings by intervals. Concretely, by the definition of outer measure as an infimum of sums of lengths of countable coverings by open intervals, taking a sequence of open intervals contracting to $[0,1]$ shows $\\lambda^{*}([0,1]) \\le 1$.\n- Lower bound: Let $\\{I_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ be any countable cover of $[0,1]$ by open intervals. By compactness of $[0,1]$ (Heine–Borel), there exists a finite subcover $\\{I_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{n}$. The union $\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n} I_{k}$ is a finite union of intervals; merging overlaps yields a finite disjoint union $\\bigcup_{j=1}^{m} J_{j}$ of open intervals with $\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n} I_{k}=\\bigcup_{j=1}^{m} J_{j}$ and $\\sum_{j=1}^{m} |J_{j}| \\le \\sum_{k=1}^{n} |I_{k}|$, where $|(\\alpha,\\beta)|=\\beta-\\alpha$ denotes interval length.

This exercise provides a hands-on method for proving a set has measure zero by explicitly constructing a covering of open intervals whose total length can be made arbitrarily small. This technique of using subadditivity and a carefully designed covering is a fundamental tool in the measure-theorist's toolkit [@problem_id:1427216].", "problem": "An analyst is studying the set of all algebraic numbers, which are real numbers that are roots of a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients.

For any given positive real number $\\epsilon$, they construct a covering set, $C(\\epsilon)$, which is the union of an infinite sequence of open intervals $\\{I_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$. For each integer $n \\ge 1$, the interval $I_n$ is centered at the algebraic number $q_n$ and is defined to have a length of $L_n = \\epsilon \\cdot \\exp(-n)$.

However, a fundamental property of measure theory states that the measure of a union of sets is less than or equal to the sum of the measures of the individual sets. This provides a useful upper bound.\n\nLet $M(\\epsilon)$ be this upper bound for the measure of $C(\\epsilon)$, which is given by the sum of the lengths of all the intervals in the covering.
