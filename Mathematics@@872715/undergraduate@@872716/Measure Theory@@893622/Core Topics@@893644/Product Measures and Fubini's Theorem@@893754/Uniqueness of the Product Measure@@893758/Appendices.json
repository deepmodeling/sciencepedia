Since $\\mu$ is a non-zero measure, its Fourier transform $\\hat{\\mu}$ is not identically zero. Let $O = \\{s \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\hat{\\mu}(s) \\neq 0\\}$. Since $\\hat{\\mu}$ is continuous, $O$ is an open set.

A continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ that has arbitrarily small periods must be a constant function.\nTherefore, $\\hat{\\mu}(s) = C$ for some constant $C$.\n\nTo determine the constant $C$, we can evaluate $\\hat{\\mu}(s)$ at $s=0$:\n$$ C = \\hat{\\mu}(0) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} e^{-i(0)x} \\, d\\mu(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} 1 \\, d\\mu(x) = \\mu(\\mathbb{R}) $$\nSo, $\\hat{\\mu}(s) = \\mu(\\mathbb{R})$ for all $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

The integral of a non-negative function over a positive measure space is zero if and only if the function is zero $\\mu$-almost everywhere.\nThus, for any given $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we must have $1 - \\cos(sx) = 0$ for $\\mu$-almost all $x$. This implies that for any $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the support of $\\mu$ must be contained in the set $\\{x \\mid \\cos(sx) = 1\\} = \\{x \\mid sx \\in 2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\nThis condition must hold for *every* $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Let $S_{\\mu}$ be the support of $\\mu$. Take any point $x_0 \\in S_{\\mu}$. Then for this $x_0$, it must be true that $sx_0 \\in 2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}$ for all $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nIf we assume $x_0 \\neq 0$, we can choose a value for $s$ that leads to a contradiction. For example, let $s = \\pi/x_0$. Then $sx_0 = \\pi$, which is not an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. This violates the condition.\nThe only way to avoid this contradiction for all $s$ is if $x_0 = 0$. This means that any point in the support must be 0.\nTherefore, the support of $\\mu$ can at most be the set $\\{0\\}$, i.e., $S_{\\mu} \\subseteq \\{0\\}$.\n\nSince we are given that $\\mu$ is a non-zero measure, its support cannot be empty. Thus, the support must be exactly $\\{0\\}$.\nA measure whose support is a single point is a point mass (a Dirac measure or a multiple of it). In this case, $\\mu=c \\delta_0$ for some constant $c0$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. The support of $\\mu$ is $\\{0\\}$, not $\\mathbb{R}$. This is false.\nB. The support of $\\mu$ is $\\{0\\}$, which consists of a single point. This is true.\nC. The support is a single point, not a countably infinite set. This is false.\nD. A point mass is a singular measure, not absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. This is false.\nE. The total mass is $\\mu(\\mathbb{R}) = c$, which can be any positive number, not necessarily 1.
