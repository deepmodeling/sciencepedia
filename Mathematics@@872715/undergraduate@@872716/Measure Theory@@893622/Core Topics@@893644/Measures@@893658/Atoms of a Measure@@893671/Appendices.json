The claim is true. Because the set $A$ is dense in $[0, 1]$, any open set containing a point from $A$ must also contain irrational numbers. This interconnectedness prevents any part of $A$ from being separated in a way that would satisfy the atom definition, forcing any subset of $A$ to have a measure proportional to its size, which violates the all-or-nothing condition for an atom.\n\nB. The claim is true. The set $A$ is a countable union of singletons, $A = \\bigcup_{q \\in A} \\{q\\}$. The Lebesgue measure of any singleton is $0$, so the Lebesgue measure of $A$ is $0$. Since any physically meaningful finite Borel measure must be absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, it follows that $\\mu(A)=0$ for any such $\\mu$. A set with measure zero cannot be an atom.\n\nC. The claim is false. A countable set like $A$ can only be an atom if the measure is entirely concentrated at a single point, say $q_0 \\in A$. In this case, the true atom is the singleton set $\\{q_0\\}$, not the larger set $A$. Therefore, while a subset of $A$ can be an atom, $A$ itself cannot.\n\nD. The claim is false. A valid counterexample can be constructed using a Dirac measure. Let $q_0$ be any point in $A$ (for example, $q_0 = 1/2$). Define a measure $\\mu$ such that for any Borel set $E \\in \\mathcal{B}$, $\\mu(E)=1$ if $q_0 \\in E$ and $\\mu(E)=0$ otherwise.

First observe that $A$ is countable, so we can enumerate it as $A=\\{q_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$.

Therefore, for $A$ to be an atom, all but at most one singleton in $A$ must have measure $0$, and the remaining one must carry the entire mass of $A$, i.e., there must exist $q_{0}\\in A$ such that\n$$\n\\mu(\\{q_{0}\\})=\\mu(A)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\mu(\\{q\\})=0\\ \\text{for all }q\\in A\\setminus\\{q_{0}\\}.\n$$\nIn that case, for any measurable $B\\subseteq A$, either $q_{0}\\notin B$ and $\\mu(B)=0$, or $q_{0}\\in B$ and $\\mu(B)\\geq \\mu(\\{q_{0}\\})=\\mu(A)$, hence $\\mu(B)=\\mu(A)$. Thus $A$ satisfies the atom definition.\n\nA concrete example is the Dirac measure at $q_{0}\\in A$, namely $\\mu=\\delta_{q_{0}}$, defined by $\\mu(E)=1$ if $q_{0}\\in E$ and $\\mu(E)=0$ otherwise.
