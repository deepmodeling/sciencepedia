The measure of a product set can often be found using Fubini's theorem, which relates the product measure to iterated integrals. A fundamental property of product measures is that if one of the factor sets has measure zero, the entire product set has measure zero. We will first determine the 1-dimensional measure of $S$, $m_1(S)$.\n\nThe set $S$ is a Cantor-like set. To find its measure, we construct a sequence of sets $C_n$ that cover $S$.\nFor any positive integer $n$, let's consider the set of all numbers in $[0,1]$ that can be formed using only the digits 3 and 7 in their first $n$ decimal places. Such a number $x$ must lie in an interval of the form $[0.d_1d_2...d_n, 0.d_1d_2...d_n + 10^{-n}]$, where each $d_k \\in \\{3, 7\\}$.\nSince there are two choices for each of the $n$ digits, there are $2^n$ such prefixes. Each corresponding interval has length $10^{-n}$.\nLet $C_n$ be the union of these $2^n$ intervals. The total length (measure) of $C_n$ is:\n$$m_1(C_n) = 2^n \\times \\frac{1}{10^n} = \\left(\\frac{2}{10}\\right)^n = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^n$$\nBy construction, every number in the set $S$ is contained within $C_n$ for every $n \\geq 1$. Therefore, $S \\subset C_n$ for all $n$.\nBy the monotonicity of the Lebesgue measure, $m_1(S) \\leq m_1(C_n)$. This gives:\n$$m_1(S) \\leq \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^n \\quad \\text{for all } n \\geq 1$$\nAs we can make the measure of the covering set arbitrarily small by taking $n$ to be large:\n$$m_1(S) \\leq \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^n = 0$$\nSince measure is non-negative, we must have $m_1(S) = 0$. A set with measure zero is also known as a null set.\n\nNow, for the measure of $A = S \\times [0, 5]$. The 2-dimensional measure of such a product is the product of the 1-dimensional measures of the constituent sets:\n$$m_2(A) = m_1(S) \\times m_1([0, 5])$$\nSince $m_1(S) = 0$ and $m_1([0, 5]) = 5 - 0 = 5$, we have:\n$$m_2(A) = 0 \\times 5 = 0$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate $m_2(A \\cap B)$**\nFirst, we identify the intersection set $A \\cap B$:\n$$A \\cap B = (S \\times [0, 5]) \\cap ([0.25, 0.5] \\times [2, 4])$$\nThe intersection of Cartesian products is the Cartesian product of the intersections of the corresponding sets:\n$$A \\cap B = (S \\cap [0.25, 0.5]) \\times ([0, 5] \\cap [2, 4])$$\nLet's call the new sets $S' = S \\cap [0.25, 0.5]$ and $I' = [0, 5] \\cap [2, 4] = [2, 4]$.\nThe set $S'$ is a subset of $S$. Since $m_1(S)=0$, and measure is monotonic (i.e., if $X \\subset Y$, then $m(X) \\leq m(Y)$), it must be that $m_1(S') = 0$.\nThe set $I'$ is an interval of length $m_1(I') = 4 - 2 = 2$.\nThe measure of the intersection is therefore:\n$$m_2(A \\cap B) = m_2(S' \\times I') = m_1(S') \\times m_1(I')$$\n$$m_2(A \\cap B) = 0 \\times 2 = 0$$\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results**\nFinally, we substitute the measures we found back into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n$$m_2(A \\cup B) = m_2(A) + m_2(B) - m_2(A \\cap B)$$\n$$m_2(A \\cup B) = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} - 0 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe 2-dimensional Lebesgue measure of the union of the sets is $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "1443921"}, {"introduction": "Once we can identify sets of measure zero, a natural question arises: does this property persist under transformations?
