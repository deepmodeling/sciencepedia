Let's recall the definiton of a measure $\\mu$ on a measurable space $(X, \\mathcal{M})$.\nA measure $\\mu: \\mathcal{M} \\to [0, \\infty]$ must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  The measure of the empty set is zero: $\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0$.\n2.  Countable additivity: For any countable sequence of pairwise disjoint sets $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\infty}$ in $\\mathcal{M}$, we have $\\mu\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} E_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\mu(E_i)$.\n\nFrom these axioms, two crucial properties can be derived.\n\nFirst, non-negativity: By its very definition, the codomain of a measure $\\mu$ is $[0, \\infty]$. This means that for any set $E \\in \\mathcal{M}$, its measure $\\mu(E)$ must be greater than or equal to zero.\n$$ \\mu(E) \\ge 0 \\quad \\forall E \\in \\mathcal{M} $$\n\nSecond, monotonicity: If $A, B \\in \\mathcal{M}$ and $A \\subseteq B$, then $\\mu(A) \\le \\mu(B)$. We can prove this from the axioms. Since $A \\subseteq B$, we can write $B$ as the disjoint union of two measurable sets: $B = A \\cup (B \\setminus A)$.
