We will first find expressions for the measures $\\mu(E_n(\\epsilon))$ and $\\mu(F_n(\\epsilon))$ for a general $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$, and then compute the limit of their ratio. Finally, we will substitute the given value of $\\epsilon$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the set $E_n(\\epsilon)$. By definition, $E_n(\\epsilon) = \\{x \\in [0,1] : |f_n(x)| \\geq \\epsilon\\}$.\nThe function is $f_n(x) = \\frac{1}{nx+1}$. For $x \\in [0,1]$ and $n \\geq 1$, the term $nx+1$ is always positive. Therefore, $|f_n(x)| = f_n(x)$.\nThe inequality becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{nx+1} \\geq \\epsilon $$\nSince $\\epsilon > 0$ and $nx+1 > 0$, we can take the reciprocal of both sides, which reverses the inequality sign:\n$$ nx+1 \\leq \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} $$\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n$$ nx \\leq \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1 $$\n$$ x \\leq \\frac{1}{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1\\right) $$\nThe set $E_n(\\epsilon)$ consists of all $x$ in $[0,1]$ that satisfy this condition. Since $x$ must also be non-negative, the set is given by:\n$$ E_n(\\epsilon) = \\left\\{ x \\in [0,1] : 0 \\leq x \\leq \\frac{1}{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1\\right) \\right\\} $$\nThe condition $0  \\epsilon  1$ implies that $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} > 1$, so $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1 > 0$.\nFor any fixed $\\epsilon$, as $n \\to \\infty$, the upper bound $\\frac{1}{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1\\right)$ will eventually become less than 1. For such large values of $n$, the set $E_n(\\epsilon)$ is simply the interval $\\left[0, \\frac{1}{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1\\right)\\right]$.\nThe Lebesgue measure $\\mu$ of an interval is its length. Thus, for sufficiently large $n$:\n$$ \\mu(E_n(\\epsilon)) = \\frac{1}{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1\\right) $$\n\nNext, we determine the set $F_n(\\epsilon)$. By definition, $F_n(\\epsilon) = \\{x \\in [0,1] : |g_n(x)| \\geq \\epsilon\\}$.\nThe function is $g_n(x) = \\exp(-nx)$. Since the exponential function is always positive, $|g_n(x)| = g_n(x)$.\nThe inequality becomes:\n$$ \\exp(-nx) \\geq \\epsilon $$\nThe natural logarithm function, $\\ln$, is strictly increasing, so we can apply it to both sides without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ \\ln(\\exp(-nx)) \\geq \\ln(\\epsilon) $$\n$$ -nx \\geq \\ln(\\epsilon) $$\nMultiplying by $-1/n$ (a negative number, since $n \\geq 1$) reverses the inequality again:\n$$ x \\leq -\\frac{\\ln(\\epsilon)}{n} $$\nThis can be rewritten as $x \\leq \\frac{\\ln(1/\\epsilon)}{n}$. Since $0  \\epsilon  1$, we have $1/\\epsilon > 1$, and $\\ln(1/\\epsilon) > 0$.\nThe set $F_n(\\epsilon)$ consists of all $x \\in [0,1]$ satisfying this condition:\n$$ F_n(\\epsilon) = \\left\\{ x \\in [0,1] : 0 \\leq x \\leq \\frac{\\ln(1/\\epsilon)}{n} \\right\\} $$\nSimilar to the previous case, for any fixed $\\epsilon$, the upper bound $\\frac{\\ln(1/\\epsilon)}{n}$ will become less than 1 for sufficiently large $n$. For such $n$, the set is the interval $\\left[0, \\frac{\\ln(1/\\epsilon)}{n}\\right]$.\nThe measure of this set is its length:\n$$ \\mu(F_n(\\epsilon)) = \\frac{\\ln(1/\\epsilon)}{n} $$\n\nNow, we can compute the limit of the ratio.
