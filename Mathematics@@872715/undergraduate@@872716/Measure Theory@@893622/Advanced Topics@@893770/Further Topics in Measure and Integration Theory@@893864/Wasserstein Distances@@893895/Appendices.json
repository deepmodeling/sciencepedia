This final exercise shifts focus to finding the 'optimal transport plan'—the explicit mapping that minimizes the cost of transforming one discrete distribution into another. By framing the problem as a simple logistics scenario, you will connect the abstract mathematical definition to a concrete, real-world application, revealing the operational meaning of the distance [@problem_id:1465059].", "problem": "Consider a simple logistics problem for distributing a resource. A company has two supply depots located at positions $x_1=0$ and $x_2=2$ along a straight highway. Each depot holds exactly half of the total available resource. This resource needs to be delivered to two distribution centers located at positions $y_1=1$ and $y_2=3$ along the same highway. Each distribution center demands exactly half of the total resource.\n\nThis distribution can be modeled using a concept from measure theory called optimal transport. The initial resource distribution is represented by a probability measure $\\mu = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_2$, where $\\delta_x$ is the Dirac delta measure, signifying a point mass at position $x$. The target distribution at the centers is given by the measure $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_3$.\n\nA \"transport plan\" specifies how much resource to move from each depot to each center. For this discrete case, a transport plan $\\gamma$ can be represented by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\Gamma = (\\gamma_{ij})$, where $\\gamma_{ij}$ is the fraction of the total resource moved from depot $i$ (at position $x_i$) to center $j$ (at position $y_j$). A valid plan must satisfy the supply and demand constraints: the total resource shipped from each depot and the total resource received by each center must match the given distributions.\n\nThe cost of transporting one unit of resource from a location $x$ to a location $y$ is proportional to the distance traveled, so we can define the cost as $c(x,y) = |x-y|$. The total transport cost for a given plan is the sum of the costs for all individual movements, weighted by the fraction of resource moved along each path. The goal of optimal transport is to find the plan that minimizes this total cost.\n\nYour task is to determine the optimal transport plan for this scenario. Find the matrix $\\Gamma_{opt} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma_{11}  \\gamma_{12} \\\\ \\gamma_{21}  \\gamma_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$ that minimizes the total transport cost. The element $\\gamma_{11}$ represents the fraction of resource moved from depot $x_1=0$ to center $y_1=1$, $\\gamma_{12}$ from $x_1=0$ to $y_2=3$, $\\gamma_{21}$ from $x_2=2$ to $y_1=1$, and $\\gamma_{22}$ from $x_2=2$ to $y_2=3$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the optimal transport plan $\\gamma$, represented by a matrix $\\Gamma = (\\gamma_{ij})$, that minimizes the cost of moving mass from a distribution $\\mu = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_2$ to a distribution $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_3$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the constraints on the elements $\\gamma_{ij}$ of the transport matrix $\\Gamma$. The matrix is indexed such that $i=1$ corresponds to the source point $x_1=0$, $i=2$ to $x_2=2$, $j=1$ to the destination point $y_1=1$, and $j=2$ to $y_2=3$.\n\nThe marginal constraints require that the sum of each row equals the mass at the corresponding source point, and the sum of each column equals the mass at the corresponding destination point.\n\nRow sums (supply constraints):\n1.  The total mass leaving $x_1=0$ must be $\\mu(\\{0\\}) = 1/2$. So, $\\gamma_{11} + \\gamma_{12} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n2.  The total mass leaving $x_2=2$ must be $\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 1/2$. So, $\\gamma_{21} + \\gamma_{22} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nColumn sums (demand constraints):\n1.  The total mass arriving at $y_1=1$ must be $\\nu(\\{1\\}) = 1/2$. So, $\\gamma_{11} + \\gamma_{21} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n2.  The total mass arriving at $y_2=3$ must be $\\nu(\\{3\\}) = 1/2$. So, $\\gamma_{12} + \\gamma_{22} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nAdditionally, the amount of mass moved cannot be negative, so $\\gamma_{ij} \\ge 0$ for all $i,j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\nNext, we define the total cost function to be minimized. The cost of moving a unit mass from source $x_i$ to destination $y_j$ is $c_{ij} = |x_i - y_j|$. Let's compute the cost matrix $C = (c_{ij})$:\n$c_{11} = |x_1 - y_1| = |0 - 1| = 1$\n$c_{12} = |x_1 - y_2| = |0 - 3| = 3$\n$c_{21} = |x_2 - y_1| = |2 - 1| = 1$\n$c_{22} = |x_2 - y_2| = |2 - 3| = 1$\n\nSo the cost matrix is $C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  3 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe total transport cost, which we want to minimize, is given by the sum of the products of costs and corresponding mass fractions:\n$$ \\mathcal{C}(\\Gamma) = \\sum_{i=1}^{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{2} c_{ij} \\gamma_{ij} = 1\\gamma_{11} + 3\\gamma_{12} + 1\\gamma_{21} + 1\\gamma_{22} $$\n\nNow we solve this constrained minimization problem. The four linear constraints on $\\gamma_{ij}$ are not independent. Let's express all variables in terms of one, say $\\gamma_{11}$. Let $\\gamma_{11} = t$.\nFrom the first row sum constraint: $\\gamma_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\gamma_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} - t$.\nFrom the first column sum constraint: $\\gamma_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\gamma_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} - t$.\nFrom the second row sum constraint: $\\gamma_{22} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\gamma_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - t\\right) = t$.\nWe can check that this also satisfies the second column sum constraint: $\\gamma_{12} + \\gamma_{22} = (\\frac{1}{2} - t) + t = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo, any valid transport plan can be written as a function of the single parameter $t$:\n$$ \\Gamma(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} t  \\frac{1}{2} - t \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} - t  t \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe non-negativity constraint $\\gamma_{ij} \\ge 0$ implies $t \\ge 0$ and $\\frac{1}{2} - t \\ge 0$, which means $t \\le \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the valid range for $t$ is $0 \\le t \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we express the total cost $\\mathcal{C}$ as a function of $t$:\n$$ \\mathcal{C}(t) = 1(t) + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - t\\right) + 1\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - t\\right) + 1(t) $$\n$$ \\mathcal{C}(t) = t + \\frac{3}{2} - 3t + \\frac{1}{2} - t + t $$\n$$ \\mathcal{C}(t) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (1 - 3 - 1 + 1)t $$\n$$ \\mathcal{C}(t) = 2 - 2t $$\n\nTo minimize $\\mathcal{C}(t) = 2 - 2t$ on the interval $t \\in [0, \\frac{1}{2}]$, we need to make the term $-2t$ as small as possible. This means we should choose the largest possible value for $t$. The maximum value for $t$ in its domain is $t = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting $t = \\frac{1}{2}$ into our parameterized matrix $\\Gamma(t)$, we find the optimal transport plan:\n$\\gamma_{11} = t = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$\\gamma_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} - t = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 0$\n$\\gamma_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} - t = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 0$\n$\\gamma_{22} = t = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThus, the optimal transport matrix is:\n$$ \\Gamma_{opt} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis plan corresponds to moving all the resource from depot $x_1=0$ to center $y_1=1$ and all the resource from depot $x_2=2$ to center $y_2=3$.
