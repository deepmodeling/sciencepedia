For $x \\in [0, 5)$, the floor function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ can take integer values $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\nFor each of these integer values of $k$, we get a corresponding interval of $x$ values:\n- For $k=0$: $0+a \\le x < 0+b$, which is the interval $[a, b)$.\n- For $k=1$: $1+a \\le x < 1+b$, which is the interval $[1+a, 1+b)$.\n- For $k=2$: $2+a \\le x < 2+b$, which is the interval $[2+a, 2+b)$.\n- For $k=3$: $3+a \\le x < 3+b$, which is the interval $[3+a, 3+b)$.\n- For $k=4$: $4+a \\le x < 4+b$, which is the interval $[4+a, 4+b)$.\n\nEach of these intervals is contained within the domain $X=[0, 5)$. For example, for $k=4$, since $0 \\le a < b < 1$, we have $4 \\le 4+a < x < 4+b < 5$. All these intervals are subsets of $[0, 5)$.\n\nThe full preimage $f^{-1}([a, b))$ is the union of these five intervals:\n$$ f^{-1}([a, b)) = [a, b) \\cup [1+a, 1+b) \\cup [2+a, 2+b) \\cup [3+a, 3+b) \\cup [4+a, 4+b) $$\n$$ f^{-1}([a, b)) = \\bigcup_{k=0}^{4} [k+a, k+b) $$\nThese five intervals are disjoint.
