This problem concerns the construction of a function that highlights the distinction between functions of bounded variation and absolutely continuous functions.\n\nLet $C$ be the standard Cantor middle-third set, defined as the set of all numbers $x \\in [0,1]$ that have a ternary (base-3) expansion consisting only of the digits $0$ and $2$.\n$$C = \\left\\{ x = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{d_k}{3^k} \\;\\middle|\\; d_k \\in \\{0, 2\\} \\text{ for all } k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\right\\}$$\nA related function, the Cantor function (or \"devil's staircase\") $c(x)$, is constructed as follows. First, for any point $y \\in C$ with ternary expansion $y = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{d_k}{3^k}$ (where $d_k \\in \\{0,2\\}$), we define a preliminary map $c_0(y) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{d_k/2}{2^k}$. The Cantor function $c: [0,1] \\to [0,1]$ is then defined as the extension of $c_0$ to the entire interval by setting\n$$c(x) = \\sup\\{c_0(y) \\mid y \\in C, y \\le x\\}$$\nNow, consider the function $f: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by\n$$f(x) = 3\\sin(\\pi c(x))$$\nYou are asked to find two quantities related to this function:\n1.

The Lebesgue measure $m$ of the set $f(C)$, which is the image of the Cantor set under the function $f$.\n\nProvide the values of $V$ and $m$ as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} V  m \\end{pmatrix}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total variation $V$ of the function $f(x) = 3\\sin(\\pi c(x))$ on $[0,1]$ and the Lebesgue measure $m$ of the set $f(C)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the properties of the Cantor function $c(x)$.\n1.  **Continuity:** The function $c(x)$ as defined is continuous on $[0,1]$.\n2.  **Monotonicity:** It is non-decreasing. For $x_1  x_2$, the set $\\{c_0(y) \\mid y \\in C, y \\le x_1\\}$ is a subset of $\\{c_0(y) \\mid y \\in C, y \\le x_2\\}$, so the supremum of the first set is less than or equal to the supremum of the second. Thus $c(x_1) \\le c(x_2)$.\n3.  **Boundary Values:** For $x=0$, the only $y \\in C$ with $y \\le 0$ is $y=0 = (0.000\\dots)_3$. So $c_0(0)=(0.000\\dots)_2=0$, and $c(0)=0$. For $x=1$, $c(1) = \\sup\\{c_0(y) \\mid y \\in C, y \\le 1\\}$. Since $1=(0.222\\dots)_3 \\in C$, and $c_0(1)=(0.111\\dots)_2 = 1$, and $c(x)$ is non-decreasing, $c(1)=1$.\n4.  **Behavior on removed intervals:** The complement of the Cantor set in $[0,1]$, denoted $[0,1]\\setminus C$, is a union of disjoint open intervals. On each of these removed intervals, say $(a,b)$, the function $c(x)$ is constant. For example, on the first removed interval $(1/3, 2/3)$, $c(x) = 1/2$.\n5.  **Image of the Cantor set:** A crucial property is that the Cantor function maps the Cantor set $C$ (which has Lebesgue measure 0) onto the entire interval $[0,1]$. That is, $c(C) = [0,1]$. To see this, take any $z \\in [0,1]$. It has a binary expansion $z = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty b_k 2^{-k}$ where $b_k \\in \\{0,1\\}$. We can construct a number $x = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (2b_k) 3^{-k}$. The digits of this ternary expansion are all $0$ or $2$, so $x \\in C$. By construction, $c(x)=z$. This shows that the mapping is surjective.\n\nNow, we analyze the function $f(x) = 3\\sin(\\pi c(x))$. Since $c(x)$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ and the sine function is continuous everywhere, their composition $f(x)$ is continuous on $[0,1]$.\n\n**Part 1: Total Variation $V$**\n\nThe total variation of a function $g$ on an interval $[a,b]$ is given by $V_a^b(g) = \\sup_{P} \\sum_{i=1}^n |g(x_i) - g(x_{i-1})|$, where the supremum is taken over all partitions $P$ of $[a,b]$.\n\nIf a function is monotonic on an interval, its total variation is the absolute difference of its values at the endpoints. The function $f(x)$ is not monotonic on $[0,1]$. To determine its variation, we can analyze its behavior. Let's study how $f$ changes as its argument $c(x)$ changes. The derivative of $g(y) = 3\\sin(\\pi y)$ is $g'(y) = 3\\pi \\cos(\\pi y)$.\n-   For $y \\in [0, 1/2)$, $g'(y) > 0$, so $g(y)$ is increasing.\n-   For $y \\in (1/2, 1]$, $g'(y)  0$, so $g(y)$ is decreasing.\n\nSince $c(x)$ is non-decreasing, the monotonicity of $f(x)=g(c(x))$ follows the monotonicity of $g(y)$.\nThe value $c(x)=1/2$ is attained for all $x$ in the interval $[1/3, 2/3]$. We can split the total variation calculation over the subintervals $[0, 1/3]$, $[1/3, 2/3]$, and $[2/3, 1]$.\n$$V_0^1(f) = V_0^{1/3}(f) + V_{1/3}^{2/3}(f) + V_{2/3}^1(f)$$\n\n-   On $[0, 1/3]$: As $x$ increases from $0$ to $1/3$, $c(x)$ increases from $c(0)=0$ to $c(1/3)=1/2$. In this range of $c$, the function $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing.\n    The values at the endpoints are $f(0) = 3\\sin(\\pi c(0)) = 3\\sin(0) = 0$ and $f(1/3) = 3\\sin(\\pi c(1/3)) = 3\\sin(\\pi/2) = 3$.\n    So, the variation on this interval is $V_0^{1/3}(f) = |f(1/3) - f(0)| = |3 - 0| = 3$.\n\n-   On $[1/3, 2/3]$: For all $x$ in this interval, $c(x)=1/2$. Thus $f(x) = 3\\sin(\\pi/2) = 3$ is constant. The variation of a constant function is zero.\n    So, $V_{1/3}^{2/3}(f) = 0$.\n\n-   On $[2/3, 1]$: As $x$ increases from $2/3$ to $1$, $c(x)$ increases from $c(2/3)=1/2$ to $c(1)=1$. In this range of $c$, the function $f(x)$ is monotonically decreasing.\n    The values at the endpoints are $f(2/3) = 3\\sin(\\pi c(2/3)) = 3\\sin(\\pi/2) = 3$ and $f(1) = 3\\sin(\\pi c(1)) = 3\\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\n    So, the variation on this interval is $V_{2/3}^1(f) = |f(1) - f(2/3)| = |0 - 3| = 3$.\n\nThe total variation is the sum of the variations on these subintervals:\n$$V = V_0^1(f) = 3 + 0 + 3 = 6$$\nThe function $f(x)$ is continuous and of bounded variation.\n\n**Part 2: Lebesgue Measure $m$ of $f(C)$**\n\nThe set whose measure we need to find is $f(C) = \\{f(x) \\mid x \\in C\\}$. This can be rewritten using the 'inner' function $c(x)$:\n$$f(C) = \\{3\\sin(\\pi c(x)) \\mid x \\in C\\}$$\nAs established earlier, the image of the Cantor set under the Cantor function is the entire unit interval, $c(C) = [0,1]$. This means that as $x$ ranges over all values in $C$, the value $c(x)$ takes on every real number in $[0,1]$.\nLet $y = c(x)$. Then the set $f(C)$ is equivalent to the set of values of $g(y) = 3\\sin(\\pi y)$ for all $y \\in [0,1]$.\n$$f(C) = \\{3\\sin(\\pi y) \\mid y \\in [0,1]\\}$$\nWe need to find the range of the function $g(y) = 3\\sin(\\pi y)$ on the interval $y \\in [0,1]$.\n-   At $y=0$, $g(0) = 3\\sin(0) = 0$.\n-   At $y=1/2$, $g(1/2) = 3\\sin(\\pi/2) = 3$.\n-   At $y=1$, $g(1) = 3\\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\nSince $g(y)$ is continuous, it takes on all values between its minimum and maximum. The minimum value on $[0,1]$ is $0$ and the maximum is $3$. Therefore, the range of $g(y)$ on $[0,1]$ is the closed interval $[0,3]$.\n$$f(C) = [0,3]$$\nThe Lebesgue measure of a closed interval $[a,b]$ is $b-a$.\n$$m = m(f(C)) = m([0,3]) = 3 - 0 = 3$$\nThe fact that a set of measure zero ($C$) is mapped to a set of positive measure ($[0,3]$) demonstrates that the function $f(x)$ is not absolutely continuous, despite being continuous and of bounded variation.\n\nThe required values are $V=6$ and $m=3$.
