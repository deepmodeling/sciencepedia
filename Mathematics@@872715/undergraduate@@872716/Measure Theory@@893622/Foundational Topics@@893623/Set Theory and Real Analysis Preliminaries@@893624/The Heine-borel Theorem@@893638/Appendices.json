Here, $p_1, p_2,$ and $p_3$ are the probabilities of the first, second, and third outcomes, respectively.\n\nBy the axioms of probability, these components must satisfy two conditions: each probability must be non-negative, and the sum of all probabilities must equal one.

According to the Heine-Borel theorem, a set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact if and only if it is both closed and bounded.\n\n**Step 1: Check if the set $S$ is bounded.**\n\nA set is bounded if it can be contained within a ball of finite radius centered at the origin. Let $\\mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2, p_3)$ be an arbitrary point in $S$. We need to find an upper bound for its Euclidean norm, $||\\mathbf{p}|| = \\sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2}$.\n\nFrom the definition of $S$, we have $p_1 \\ge 0, p_2 \\ge 0, p_3 \\ge 0$, and $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$. Since the probabilities are non-negative and sum to one, it must be the case that $0 \\le p_i \\le 1$ for each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nIf $0 \\le p_i \\le 1$, then squaring the value gives $p_i^2 \\le p_i$. Applying this to each component, we have:\n$p_1^2 \\le p_1$\n$p_2^2 \\le p_2$\n$p_3^2 \\le p_3$\n\nSumming these inequalities, we get:\n$$p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2 \\le p_1 + p_2 + p_3$$\nFrom the definition of $S$, we know that $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$. Therefore,\n$$||\\mathbf{p}||^2 = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2 \\le 1$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$||\\mathbf{p}|| \\le 1$$\nThis shows that every point in $S$ is at a distance of at most 1 from the origin. Thus, $S$ is contained within the closed unit ball centered at the origin, $B[0, 1]$.

Let $(\\mathbf{p}_k)_{k=1}^\\infty$ be a sequence of points in $S$ that converges to a limit point $\\mathbf{p} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. We must show that this limit point $\\mathbf{p}$ is also an element of $S$.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{p}_k = (p_{1,k}, p_{2,k}, p_{3,k})$ and the limit be $\\mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2, p_3)$.\nFor each $k$, the point $\\mathbf{p}_k$ is in $S$, so it satisfies the conditions:\n1. $p_{i,k} \\ge 0$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n2. $p_{1,k} + p_{2,k} + p_{3,k} = 1$.\n\nThe convergence $\\mathbf{p}_k \\to \\mathbf{p}$ implies component-wise convergence, i.e., $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} p_{i,k} = p_i$ for each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nLet's check if the limit point $\\mathbf{p}$ satisfies the two conditions for membership in $S$.\n\nFor the non-negativity condition: Since $p_{i,k} \\ge 0$ for all $k$, the limit of this sequence of non-negative numbers must also be non-negative. Thus, $p_i = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} p_{i,k} \\ge 0$ for each $i$.\n\nFor the sum condition: The function $f(x, y, z) = x + y + z$ is a polynomial and therefore continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. For a continuous function, the limit of the function applied to a sequence is equal to the function applied to the limit of the sequence.\n$$f(\\mathbf{p}) = f(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\mathbf{p}_k) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} f(\\mathbf{p}_k)$$\nWe know that for every term in the sequence, $f(\\mathbf{p}_k) = p_{1,k} + p_{2,k} + p_{3,k} = 1$.\nTherefore,\n$$f(\\mathbf{p}) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} 1 = 1$$\nThis means $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$.\n\nSince the limit point $\\mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2, p_3)$ satisfies both $p_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$ and $\\sum p_i = 1$, we conclude that $\\mathbf{p} \\in S$.
