For any fixed integer $N > 0$, we define the set $T_N = \\{q_n : n > N\\}$. The sequence $(q_n)$ contains all rational numbers in $[0, 1]$. The set $T_N$ consists of all rational numbers in $[0, 1]$ except for the first $N$ terms of the sequence, $\\{q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_N\\}$. Since we are removing only a finite number of elements from the infinite set of all rational numbers in $[0,1]$, the set $T_N$ is still an infinite set.\n\nNow, let's find the supremum of $T_N$, denoted as $S_N = \\sup(T_N)$.\nSince every element $q_n$ in the sequence belongs to the interval $[0, 1]$, we have $q_n \\le 1$ for all $n$. This means that 1 is an upper bound for the set $T_N$ for any $N$. Therefore, by the definition of the supremum (the least upper bound), we must have $S_N = \\sup(T_N) \\le 1$.\n\nNext, we must determine if this supremum is actually equal to 1. To show that $\\sup(T_N) = 1$, we need to prove that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an element $q_k \\in T_N$ such that $q_k > 1 - \\epsilon$.\n\nLet's consider any small $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $0  \\epsilon  1$. We are interested in the interval $(1-\\epsilon, 1]$. The set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, is dense in the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$. This means that for any two distinct real numbers $a$ and $b$, there exists a rational number between them. In our case, between $1-\\epsilon$ and $1$, there exist infinitely many rational numbers.\n\nThe set $T_N = \\{q_n : n > N\\}$ contains all rational numbers in $[0, 1]$ except for the finite set $\\{q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_N\\}$. Since there are infinitely many rational numbers in the interval $(1-\\epsilon, 1]$, and we are only excluding a finite number of them, the set $T_N$ must contain at least one rational number from this interval. In fact, it must contain infinitely many.\n\nSo, for any $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find an index $k > N$ such that $q_k \\in (1-\\epsilon, 1]$. This implies $q_k > 1-\\epsilon$. This is the definition of the supremum being 1. Therefore, for any $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have:\n$$ S_N = \\sup\\{q_n : n > N\\} = 1 $$\n\nNow we can compute the limit superior:\n$$ \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} q_n = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} S_N = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} 1 = 1 $$\n\nThis result holds true regardless of the specific way the rational numbers in $[0,1]$ are enumerated.
