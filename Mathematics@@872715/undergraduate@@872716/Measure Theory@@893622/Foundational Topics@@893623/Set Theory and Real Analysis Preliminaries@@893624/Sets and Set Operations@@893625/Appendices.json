If a countable collection of sets $S_1, S_2, \\dots$ are in $\\mathcal{A}$, then their union, $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} S_i$, is also in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nThe $\\sigma$-algebra $\\sigma(\\mathcal{C})$ is the smallest collection of subsets of $X$ that contains $\\mathcal{C}$ and satisfies these three properties.\n\nLet's denote the two sets in the generating collection as $A = \\{1, 2\\}$ and $B = \\{2, 3\\}$.\nWe are given that $A \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $B \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n\nFrom property (2), closure under complementation, we know that the complements of $A$ and $B$ must also be in $\\mathcal{A}$:\n$A^c = X \\setminus \\{1, 2\\} = \\{3, 4\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n$B^c = X \\setminus \\{2, 3\\} = \\{1, 4\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n\nA $\\sigma$-algebra is closed under countable unions, and therefore under finite unions. It is also closed under countable intersections. The closure under intersection follows from De Morgan's laws: for any two sets $S_1, S_2 \\in \\mathcal{A}$, their complements $S_1^c, S_2^c$ are in $\\mathcal{A}$. Their union $S_1^c \\cup S_2^c$ is in $\\mathcal{A}$. The complement of this union, $(S_1^c \\cup S_2^c)^c = S_1 \\cap S_2$, must also be in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nUsing closure under intersection, we find the intersection of the two generating sets:\n$A \\cap B = \\{1, 2\\} \\cap \\{2, 3\\} = \\{2\\}$.\nThus, the singleton set $\\{2\\}$ must be in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nNow we can use the sets we've found to generate more sets. Since $\\mathcal{A}$ is closed under intersections and complementation, it is also closed under set difference, as $S_1 \\setminus S_2 = S_1 \\cap S_2^c$.\nUsing this, we can isolate other singletons:\n- $\\{1\\} = A \\setminus \\{2\\} = \\{1, 2\\} \\setminus \\{2\\}$. Since $A \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $\\{2\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$, we must have $\\{1\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- $\\{3\\} = B \\setminus \\{2\\} = \\{2, 3\\} \\setminus \\{2\\}$. Since $B \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $\\{2\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$, we must have $\\{3\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n\nWe have now established that the singletons $\\{1\\}$, $\\{2\\}$, and $\\{3\\}$ are all members of $\\mathcal{A}$. To find the last singleton, $\\{4\\}$, we can use the union and complementation properties.\n- Since $\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$, their finite union must also be in $\\mathcal{A}$ by property (3):\n  $\\{1\\} \\cup \\{2\\} \\cup \\{3\\} = \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- Now, using property (2), the complement of this set must be in $\\mathcal{A}$:\n  $(\\{1, 2, 3\\})^c = X \\setminus \\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{4\\}$.\nTherefore, the singleton set $\\{4\\}$ must also be in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nWe have shown that the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{A} = \\sigma(\\mathcal{C})$ must contain all four singleton sets: $\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{4\\}$.\n\nAny subset of $X$ can be written as a finite (and therefore countable) union of these singleton sets. For example, the set $\\{1, 3\\}$ can be written as $\\{1\\} \\cup \\{3\\}$. Since $\\mathcal{A}$ contains all singletons and is closed under countable unions, it must contain all possible unions of these singletons.\nThe collection of all possible unions of these singletons is precisely the power set of $X$, denoted $\\mathcal{P}(X)$. The power set is the set of all subsets of $X$.\n\nTherefore, the generated $\\sigma$-algebra is the entire power set of $X$:\n$\\sigma(\\mathcal{C}) = \\mathcal{P}(X)$.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of sets in $\\sigma(\\mathcal{C})$. This is the cardinality of the power set of $X$. For a finite set with $n$ elements, the cardinality of its power set is $2^n$.\nIn our case, the set $X = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ has $n=4$ elements.\nThe number of sets in $\\sigma(\\mathcal{C})$ is therefore $2^4$.\n\n$2^4 = 16$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "1443697"}, {"introduction": "While individual $\\sigma$-algebras are well-behaved structures, it is crucial to understand how they interact with each other.
