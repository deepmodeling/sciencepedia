A group of order $p^{2}$ has a nontrivial center, and if it had an element of order $p^{2}$ it would be cyclic. The given condition rules out any element of order $p^{2}$, so $G$ is not cyclic. Therefore $G$ is abelian of exponent $p$, hence isomorphic to the elementary abelian group $C_{p}\\times C_{p}$, which can be viewed as a $2$-dimensional vector space over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$.\n\nSubgroups of $G$ of order $p$ correspond exactly to $1$-dimensional subspaces of this $2$-dimensional vector space. To count these, note that:\n- The number of nonzero vectors is $p^{2}-1$.\n- Each $1$-dimensional subspace has exactly $p-1$ nonzero vectors.\n- Distinct $1$-dimensional subspaces intersect only at $\\{0\\}$, so their sets of nonzero vectors are disjoint.\n\nHence, the number $N$ of subgroups of order $p$ is given by\n$$\nN=\\frac{p^{2}-1}{p-1}=p+1.\n$$\nThe factorization $p^{2}-1=(p-1)(p+1)$ yields the simplified expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p+1}$$", "id": "1812067"}, {"introduction": "A defining characteristic of all p-groups is that they are nilpotent, meaning their upper central series eventually terminates at the group itself.

This group consists of eight elements given by the set $\\{1, -1, i, j, k, -i, -j, -k\\}$. The group operation is defined by the following relations, where $1$ is the identity element and $-1$ commutes with all elements:\n$$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$$\nFrom these relations, one can derive others, such as $ij = k$, $ji = -k$, $jk = i$, $kj = -i$, $ki = j$, and $ik = -j$.\n\nThe upper central series of a group $G$ is a sequence of subgroups defined recursively as follows:\n-   $Z_0(G) = \\{e\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$.\n-   For $i \\ge 0$, $Z_{i+1}(G)$ is the unique subgroup of $G$ containing $Z_i(G)$ such that the quotient group $Z_{i+1}(G) / Z_i(G)$ is the center of the quotient group $G / Z_i(G)$. In other words, $Z_{i+1}(G) / Z_i(G) = Z(G / Z_i(G))$.\n\nA group $G$ is called nilpotent if its upper central series reaches the entire group $G$ after a finite number of steps.

Next, check that no other element is central: for instance, $ij=k$ while $ji=-k$, hence $ij \\neq ji$, so $i \\notin Z(Q_{8})$. Similarly, $j$ and $k$ (and their negatives) fail to commute with some elements.

Hence $Q_{8}/Z_{1}(Q_{8})$ is abelian, so its center is the whole quotient:\n$$\nZ\\big(Q_{8}/Z_{1}(Q_{8})\\big)=Q_{8}/Z_{1}(Q_{8}).\n$$\nBy the definition of the upper central series, this implies\n$$\nZ_{2}(Q_{8})/Z_{1}(Q_{8})=Z\\big(Q_{8}/Z_{1}(Q_{8})\\big)=Q_{8}/Z_{1}(Q_{8}),\n$$\nso $Z_{2}(Q_{8})=Q_{8}$.\n\nThus the upper central series reaches the whole group in two steps:\n$$\nZ_{0}(Q_{8})=\\{1\\},\\quad Z_{1}(Q_{8})=\\{\\pm 1\\},\\quad Z_{2}(Q_{8})=Q_{8}.\n$$\nTherefore, the nilpotency class of $Q_{8}$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1812079"}, {"introduction": "The way subgroups are embedded within a larger group reveals much about the group's structure, and the concept of normality is key to this analysis.
