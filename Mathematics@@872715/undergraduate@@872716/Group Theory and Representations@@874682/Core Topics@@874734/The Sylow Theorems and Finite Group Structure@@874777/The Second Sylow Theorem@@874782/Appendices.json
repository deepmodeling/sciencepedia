This exercise moves beyond the abstract statement by challenging you to perform a concrete calculation within the dihedral group $D_{20}$. You will find a specific element that transforms one Sylow subgroup into another, providing a hands-on feel for the concept of conjugation in action [@problem_id:1824539].", "problem": "The dihedral group $D_{20}$ represents the group of symmetries of a regular 10-gon. It can be described by the presentation $D_{20} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{10} = s^2 = e, srs = r^{-1} \\rangle$, where $r$ represents a rotation and $s$ represents a reflection. The order of this group is 20.\n\nConsider two distinct Sylow 2-subgroups of $D_{20}$. Let $P_1$ be the subgroup generated by the elements $r^5$ and $s$. Let $P_2$ be the subgroup generated by the elements $r^5$ and $sr$. According to Sylow's second theorem, these two subgroups are conjugate to each other.\n\nFind one non-identity element $g \\in D_{20}$ such that $gP_1g^{-1} = P_2$. Express your answer as an algebraic expression in terms of $r$ and $s$.", "solution": "We work in $D_{20}=\\langle r,s \\mid r^{10}=e,\\ s^{2}=e,\\ srs=r^{-1}\\rangle$. The subgroups are $P_{1}=\\langle r^{5},s\\rangle$ and $P_{2}=\\langle r^{5},sr\\rangle$. First observe that $r^{5}$ is central: using $srs=r^{-1}$, we have $s r^{5} s=(srs)^{5}=r^{-5}=r^{5}$ since $r^{10}=e$, hence $r^{5}$ commutes with both $r$ and $s$.\n\nTo find $g$ with $gP_{1}g^{-1}=P_{2}$, it suffices to ensure $g r^{5} g^{-1}=r^{5}$ (automatic since $r^{5}$ is central) and $g s g^{-1}\\in\\{sr, r^{5}sr\\}$ (the two reflections in $P_{2}$). Compute the conjugation of $s$ by powers of $r$. From $srs=r^{-1}$ we get $sr=r^{-1}s$, and equivalently $rs=sr^{-1}$. Then\n$$\nrsr^{-1}=s r^{-2}.\n$$\nBy induction on $a\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, this yields the general formula\n$$\nr^{a} s r^{-a}=s r^{-2a}.\n$$\nWe want $r^{a} s r^{-a}=sr$ or $r^{a} s r^{-a}=r^{5}sr$. The first requires $s r^{-2a}=s r$, i.e., $r^{-2a}=r$, which is $-2a\\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, impossible. The second requires $s r^{-2a}=r^{5} s r$. Since $r^5$ is central and $r^{10}=e$, we have $r^5 s r = s r^5 r = sr^6 = sr^{-4}$. Thus we need $s r^{-2a}=s r^{-4}$, i.e., $-2a\\equiv -4 \\pmod{10}$, equivalently $2a\\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}$. One solution is $a=2$. Therefore\n$$\nr^{2} s r^{-2}=s r^{-4}.\n$$\nSince $r^{5}$ is central and has order $2$, the subgroups generated by $\\{r^{5},\\,s r^{-4}\\}$ and by $\\{r^{5},\\,s r\\}$ coincide:\n$$\n\\langle r^{5},\\,s r^{-4}\\rangle=\\langle r^{5},\\,s r\\rangle=P_{2},\n$$\nbecause $r^5 (s r^{-4}) = r^5(sr^6) = sr^6r^5 = sr^{11} = sr$. Also $r^{2} r^{5} r^{-2}=r^{5}$. Hence\n$$\nr^{2} P_{1} r^{-2}=\\langle r^{2} r^{5} r^{-2},\\, r^{2} s r^{-2}\\rangle=\\langle r^{5},\\,s r^{-4}\\rangle=P_{2}.\n$$\nThus a valid non-identity conjugating element is $g=r^{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{r^{2}}$$", "id": "1824539"}, {"introduction": "A key consequence of the Sylow theorems, derived from the orbit-stabilizer theorem, is the precise relationship between the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups and the order of their normalizers.
