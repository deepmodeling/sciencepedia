This exercise invites you to explore the complete subgroup lattice of the alternating group $A_4$, a group of order 12.

An even permutation is one that can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions.\n\nConsider the group $A_4$, the group of even permutations on the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.

All subgroups of order 3 in $A_4$ are conjugate to one another.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must analyze the subgroup structure of the alternating group $A_4$ and evaluate the truth of each statement.\n\nFirst, let's list the elements of $A_4$ by their cycle structure. The set being permuted is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n1.  **Identity**: $e$. (1 element)\n2.  **3-cycles**: These are even permutations (e.g., $(123) = (13)(12)$). There are 8 such elements: $(123), (132), (124), (142), (134), (143), (234), (243)$. All have order 3.\n3.  **Products of two disjoint transpositions**: These are also even permutations (e.g., $(12)(34)$). There are 3 such elements: $(12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)$. All have order 2.\n\nThe total number of elements is $1 + 8 + 3 = 12$, which matches the given order of the group.\n\nNow, let's find the subgroups of $A_4$ by systematically considering their possible orders, according to Lagrange's Theorem (subgroup order must divide the group order). The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\n*   **Order 1**: There is only one subgroup of order 1, the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n*   **Order 2**: Subgroups of order 2 are cyclic and must be generated by an element of order 2. $A_4$ has three elements of order 2. Each generates a distinct subgroup:\n    *   $H_1 = \\{e, (12)(34)\\}$\n    *   $H_2 = \\{e, (13)(24)\\}$\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e, (14)(23)\\}$\n    This gives us **3 subgroups of order 2**.\n*   **Order 3**: Subgroups of order 3 are cyclic and generated by elements of order 3. There are 8 elements of order 3. A cyclic group of order 3, $\\{e, g, g^2\\}$, is generated by either $g$ or $g^2$. The 8 elements form 4 pairs of mutual inverses:\n    *   $\\langle(123)\\rangle = \\langle(132)\\rangle = \\{e, (123), (132)\\}$\n    *   $\\langle(124)\\rangle = \\langle(142)\\rangle = \\{e, (124), (142)\\}$\n    *   $\\langle(134)\\rangle = \\langle(143)\\rangle = \\{e, (134), (143)\\}$\n    *   $\\langle(234)\\rangle = \\langle(243)\\rangle = \\{e, (234), (243)\\}$\n    This gives us **4 subgroups of order 3**.\n*   **Order 4**: A group of order 4 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ or the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   $A_4$ has no elements of order 4, so it cannot have a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n    *   A subgroup isomorphic to $V_4$ must consist of the identity and three elements of order 2. $A_4$ has exactly three elements of order 2. Let's check if the set $V = \\{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)\\}$ forms a subgroup. The product of any two distinct non-identity elements gives the third, e.g., $(12)(34)(13)(24) = (14)(23)$. The set is closed under the group operation and contains inverses (each element is its own inverse), so it is a subgroup. Since these are the only three elements of order 2, this is the **unique subgroup of order 4**.\n*   **Order 6**: Let's test for the existence of a subgroup $H$ of order 6. If such a subgroup existed, its index in $A_4$ would be $|A_4|/|H| = 12/6 = 2$. A subgroup of index 2 is always a normal subgroup. If $H$ is normal, the quotient group $A_4/H$ would have order 2. For any element $g \\in A_4$, its coset $gH$ in the quotient group must satisfy $(gH)^2 = H$, which implies $g^2 \\in H$. Let's take an element $g$ of order 3, for instance $g=(123)$. Then $g^2 = (123)^2 = (132)$ must be in $H$. Since $H$ is a subgroup, if $(132) \\in H$, then its inverse $(123)$ must also be in $H$. This reasoning applies to all 8 elements of order 3. Thus, if $H$ existed, it would have to contain all 8 elements of order 3. This contradicts the assumption that $|H|=6$. Therefore, **there is no subgroup of order 6**.\n*   **Order 12**: The group $A_4$ itself is the only subgroup of order 12.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement:\n\n**A. The total number of distinct subgroups of $A_4$ (including the trivial subgroup and $A_4$ itself) is 10.**\nCounting the subgroups we found: 1 (order 1) + 3 (order 2) + 4 (order 3) + 1 (order 4) + 0 (order 6) + 1 (order 12) = 10.\nThis statement is **TRUE**.\n\n**B. $A_4$ possesses subgroups of order 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12.**\nOur analysis confirms the existence of subgroups for each of these orders.\nThis statement is **TRUE**.\n\n**C. $A_4$ contains a unique normal subgroup of order 4.**\nWe found a unique subgroup of order 4, which we called $V$. A subgroup is normal if it is closed under conjugation by all elements of the group. The non-identity elements of $V$ are all permutations with cycle structure (2,2). Conjugation preserves cycle structure. Since $V$ contains *all* permutations of type (2,2) in $A_4$, for any $v \\in V$ and $g \\in A_4$, the conjugate $gvg^{-1}$ must also be an element of type (2,2) (or the identity if $v=e$), and thus must be in $V$. Therefore, $V$ is a normal subgroup.\nThis statement is **TRUE**.\n\n**D. $A_4$ is a simple group.**\nA group is called simple if its only normal subgroups are the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ and the group itself. We have just shown in (C) that $A_4$ has a normal subgroup $V$ of order 4. Since $\\{e\\} \\subset V \\subset A_4$, $V$ is a proper non-trivial normal subgroup. Therefore, $A_4$ is not a simple group.\nThis statement is **FALSE**.\n\n**E. All subgroups of order 3 in $A_4$ are conjugate to one another.**\nThe order of $A_4$ is $12 = 3^1 \\cdot 4$. The subgroups of order 3 are the Sylow 3-subgroups of $A_4$. The second Sylow theorem states that all Sylow p-subgroups of a finite group are conjugate to one another. Therefore, the four subgroups of order 3 are all mutually conjugate.\nThis statement is **TRUE**.\n\nThe only false statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1606532"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of classification is to identify a group based on its abstract properties.
