This exercise provides a group defined by its generators and relations, challenging you to first understand the group's structure and then systematically partition its elements into conjugacy classes. Mastering this process is a fundamental skill for analyzing any finite group. [@problem_id:1632251]", "problem": "Consider a group $G$ generated by two elements, $a$ and $b$, subject to the relations $a^4 = 1$, $a^2 = b^2$, and $bab^{-1} = a^{-1}$, where $1$ is the identity element. This group has a finite number of elements. How many non-isomorphic irreducible complex representations does this group $G$ possess?", "solution": "We are given a group $G=\\langle a,b \\mid a^{4}=1,\\ a^{2}=b^{2},\\ b a b^{-1}=a^{-1}\\rangle$. First, we analyze its structure.\n\nFrom $b a b^{-1}=a^{-1}$, compute the conjugation of $a^{2}$ by $b$:\n$$\nb a^{2} b^{-1}=(b a b^{-1})(b a b^{-1})=a^{-1} a^{-1}=a^{-2}=a^{2},\n$$\nso $a^{2}$ commutes with $b$. It trivially commutes with $a$, hence $a^{2}\\in Z(G)$. Also $a^{2}$ has order $2$ because $a^{4}=1$.\n\nUsing $a^{2}=b^{2}$, any word in $a$ and $b$ can be reduced to one of the forms $a^{i}$ or $a^{i} b$ with $i\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$: powers of $a$ reduce modulo $4$, and any occurrence of $b^{2}$ can be replaced by $a^{2}$ which is central, allowing consolidation. Therefore,\n$$\n|G|\\leq 8.\n$$\nDefine a map to the quaternion group $Q_{8}=\\{\\pm 1,\\pm i,\\pm j,\\pm k\\}$ by sending $a\\mapsto i$ and $b\\mapsto j$. In $Q_{8}$ one has $i^{4}=1$, $i^{2}=j^{2}=-1$, and $j i j^{-1}=i^{-1}$, so the given relations are satisfied. Hence there is a surjective homomorphism $G\\to Q_{8}$, implying $|G|\\geq 8$. Combining with the upper bound gives $|G|=8$ and $G\\cong Q_{8}$.\n\nNext, determine the conjugacy classes in $G$. Since $a^{2}\\in Z(G)$, both $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{a^{2}\\}$ are singleton conjugacy classes. The relation $b a b^{-1}=a^{-1}$ shows $a\\notin Z(G)$ and that $a$ is conjugate to $a^{-1}=a^{3}$, so $\\{a,a^{3}\\}$ is a conjugacy class. For $b$, compute conjugation by $a$:\n$$\na b a^{-1} = (a b) a^{-1} = (b a^{-1}) a^{-1} = b a^{-2} = b a^{2} = a^{2} b,\n$$\nusing $a b=b a^{-1}$ (equivalent to $b a b^{-1}=a^{-1}$) and centrality of $a^{2}$. Thus the conjugacy class of $b$ is $\\{b,a^{2} b\\}$. Similarly, the conjugacy class of $a b$ is $\\{a b, a^{3} b\\}$. Therefore $G$ has exactly $5$ conjugacy classes:\n$$\n\\{1\\},\\ \\{a^{2}\\},\\ \\{a,a^{3}\\},\\ \\{b,a^{2} b\\},\\ \\{a b,a^{3} b\\}.\n$$\nFor a finite group over $\\mathbb{C}$, the number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations equals the number of conjugacy classes. Hence $G$ has $5$ irreducible complex representations up to isomorphism.\n\nEquivalently, one can confirm the degrees by using the class equation for character degrees. Compute the commutator:\n$$\n[a,b]=a b a^{-1} b^{-1} = (b a^{-1}) a^{-1} b^{-1} = b a^{-2} b^{-1} = a^{2},\n$$\nso the derived subgroup is $\\langle a^{2}\\rangle$ of order $2$, and the abelianization has order $4$. Thus there are $4$ one-dimensional representations. The sum of squares of irreducible degrees equals $|G|=8$, so if $n_{1}$ is the number of $1$-dimensional irreducibles and the remaining degrees are $d_{i}$, then\n$$\n4\\cdot 1^{2} + \\sum d_{i}^{2} = 8 \\implies \\sum d_{i}^{2} = 4,\n$$\nforcing exactly one additional irreducible of degree $2$.

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of conjugacy classes of a non-abelian group $G$ of order 21.\n\nWe can determine the number of conjugacy classes by using the class equation for a finite group $G$:\n$$|G| = |Z(G)| + \\sum_{i} [G:C_G(x_i)]$$\nwhere $Z(G)$ is the center of the group, $x_i$ are representatives from each conjugacy class not in the center, and $[G:C_G(x_i)]$ is the size of the conjugacy class containing $x_i$, with $C_G(x_i)$ being the centralizer of $x_i$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the size of the center, $|Z(G)|$. The center $Z(G)$ is a subgroup of $G$, so its order must divide $|G|=21$. The possible orders are 1, 3, 7, and 21.\nIf $|Z(G)|=21$, then $G=Z(G)$, which means $G$ is abelian. This contradicts the problem statement.\nIf $|Z(G)|=3$, the quotient group $G/Z(G)$ has order $|G|/|Z(G)| = 21/3 = 7$. Since 7 is a prime number, any group of order 7 is cyclic. A known theorem states that if $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ must be abelian. This again contradicts the problem statement.\nIf $|Z(G)|=7$, the quotient group $G/Z(G)$ has order $|G|/|Z(G)| = 21/7 = 3$. Since 3 is a prime number, this quotient group is also cyclic, implying $G$ is abelian. This is also a contradiction.\nTherefore, the only possibility is that $|Z(G)|=1$. The center of $G$ is the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element, $\\{e\\}$.\n\nNow, the class equation becomes:\n$$21 = 1 + \\sum_{i} [G:C_G(x_i)]$$\nThe size of any conjugacy class, $k_i = [G:C_G(x_i)] = |G|/|C_G(x_i)|$, must be an integer that divides the order of the group, $|G|=21$. Also, since we are summing over classes not in the center, $k_i > 1$. The possible values for the sizes of the non-trivial conjugacy classes are 3 and 7.\n\nLet $n_3$ be the number of conjugacy classes of size 3, and $n_7$ be the number of conjugacy classes of size 7. The sum of the sizes of all non-trivial conjugacy classes must be equal to $|G| - |Z(G)| = 21 - 1 = 20$. This gives us a Diophantine equation:\n$$3n_3 + 7n_7 = 20$$\nwhere $n_3$ and $n_7$ must be non-negative integers.\n\nWe can find the solutions by testing values for $n_7$:\n- If $n_7 = 0$, then $3n_3 = 20$. This has no integer solution for $n_3$.\n- If $n_7 = 1$, then $3n_3 = 20 - 7 = 13$. This has no integer solution for $n_3$.\n- If $n_7 = 2$, then $3n_3 = 20 - 14 = 6$. This gives $n_3 = 2$.
