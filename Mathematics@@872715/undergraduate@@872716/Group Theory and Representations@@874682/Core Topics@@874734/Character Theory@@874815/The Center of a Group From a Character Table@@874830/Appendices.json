The problem states that the size of every conjugacy class of $G$ is 1. We need to determine the implication of this property for the structure of $G$.\n\nThe conjugacy class of an element $g \\in G$ is the set $C(g) = \\{hgh^{-1} \\mid h \\in G\\}$. The size of this set is denoted by $|C(g)|$.\n\nWe are given that $|C(g)| = 1$ for all $g \\in G$.\n\nThere is a fundamental relationship between the size of a conjugacy class of an element and the size of its centralizer. The centralizer of an element $g$ in $G$, denoted $C_G(g)$, is the set of all elements in $G$ that commute with $g$. That is, $C_G(g) = \\{x \\in G \\mid xg = gx\\}$. The centralizer $C_G(g)$ is a subgroup of $G$.\n\nThe connection between these concepts is given by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, which for group actions by conjugation implies:\n$$|C(g)| = \\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g)|}$$\nwhere $|G|$ is the order of the group and $|C_G(g)|$ is the order of the centralizer of $g$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, $|C(g)| = 1$ for every element $g \\in G$. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n$$1 = \\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g)|}$$\nThis implies that for every $g \\in G$, we have $|C_G(g)| = |G|$.\n\nSince $C_G(g)$ is a subgroup of $G$, and its order is equal to the order of $G$, it must be that the centralizer is the entire group, i.e., $C_G(g) = G$.\n\nThe statement $C_G(g) = G$ means that every element $x \\in G$ commutes with $g$. Since this holds for all $g \\in G$, it means that for any pair of elements $x, g \\in G$, we have $xg = gx$. This is the definition of an abelian group. Therefore, the group $G$ must be abelian.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA. $G$ is a cyclic group. An abelian group is not necessarily cyclic. For example, the Klein-four group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$ is abelian but not cyclic. So, this conclusion is not necessary.\nB. $G$ is an abelian group. As we have demonstrated, this property must hold.\nC. $G$ is a simple group. A non-trivial abelian group $G$ is simple if and only if it is cyclic of prime order. However, our conclusion holds for any abelian group, such as $Z_6 = Z_2 \\times Z_3$, which is not simple (it has proper normal subgroups isomorphic to $Z_2$ and $Z_3$). So, $G$ is not necessarily simple.\nD. $G$ is the trivial group. The trivial group is abelian, but the property also holds for any non-trivial abelian group, such as $Z_3$. Therefore, we cannot conclude that $G$ must be the trivial group.\nE. $G$ has an order that is a prime number. While groups of prime order are abelian (and cyclic), not all abelian groups have prime order. For example, $Z_4$ is an abelian group of order 4, which is not prime.\n\nThe only necessary conclusion from the given information is that the group $G$ must be abelian.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1645833"}, {"introduction": "While the sizes of conjugacy classes directly reveal the center, this information is not always explicitly provided.
