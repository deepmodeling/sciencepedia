A character $\\chi$ is irreducible if and only if its inner product with itself is equal to 1:\n$$\n\\langle \\chi, \\chi \\rangle = 1\n$$\nMore generally, if $\\chi$ is any character (reducible or not), it can be decomposed into a sum of irreducible characters $\\chi_i$ of $G$:\n$$\n\\chi = \\sum_{i} n_i \\chi_i\n$$\nwhere $n_i$ are non-negative integers representing the multiplicity of each irreducible character $\\chi_i$ in the decomposition.

The function $\\chi$ is a character of $G$, but it is impossible to determine its reducibility. This is false. We have determined that it is not a character at all, and this conclusion did not require any further information about $G$.\nD. The function $\\chi$ is not a character of any representation of $G$. This is true, as demonstrated by the fact that $\\langle \\chi, \\chi \\rangle$ is not an integer.\nE. The function $\\chi$ is the character of the regular representation of $G$. This is false.
