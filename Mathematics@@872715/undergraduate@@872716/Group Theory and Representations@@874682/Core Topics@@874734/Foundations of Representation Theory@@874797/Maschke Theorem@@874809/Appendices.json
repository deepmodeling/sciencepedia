The question asks for the condition on the characteristic of $F$ that guarantees this property for all finite-dimensional representations of $G$.\n\nThis is a direct application of Maschke's Theorem. Maschke's Theorem states that for a finite group $G$ and a field $F$, every finite-dimensional representation of $G$ over $F$ is completely reducible if and only if the characteristic of the field $F$, $\\text{char}(F)$, does not divide the order of the group, $|G|$.\n\nIn this problem, the group is $G = C_5$, the cyclic group of order 5.\nThe order of the group is $|G| = 5$.\n\nAccording to Maschke's Theorem, for every representation of $C_5$ over $F$ to be completely reducible, the condition is:\n$$ \\text{char}(F) \\text{ does not divide } |G| $$\nSubstituting the order of our group, we get:\n$$ \\text{char}(F) \\text{ does not divide } 5 $$\n\nThe characteristic of a field, $\\text{char}(F)$, is either 0 or a prime number $p$.\nIf $\\text{char}(F) = 0$, then by convention, it does not divide any positive integer. Thus, 0 does not divide 5. This case satisfies the condition.\nIf $\\text{char}(F) = p$ for some prime $p$, the condition \"p does not divide 5\" means that $p \\neq 5$.\n\nSo, the complete condition is that $\\text{char}(F)$ is not equal to 5. This is equivalent to saying that $\\text{char}(F)$ does not divide 5.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\nA. $\\text{char}(F) = 5$: This is precisely the condition under which Maschke's Theorem does *not* apply. If $\\text{char}(F) = 5$, there exist representations that are not completely reducible. So, this is incorrect.\n\nB. $\\text{char}(F)$ does not divide 5: This is the exact statement of the condition derived from Maschke's Theorem. This is the correct and most general condition.\n\nC. $\\text{char}(F) = 0$: As we saw, if $\\text{char}(F) = 0$, the condition is satisfied. However, this is not the most general condition, as fields with characteristic $p$ where $p \\neq 5$ (e.g., $p=2, 3, 7, \\dots$) also satisfy the condition. The question asks for the condition that must be satisfied, and \"does not divide 5\" is the all-encompassing condition.\n\nD. $\\text{char}(F)$ is a prime number other than 5: This covers many cases where Maschke's theorem holds, but it omits the valid case where $\\text{char}(F)=0$. Therefore, it is incomplete.\n\nE. No condition on the characteristic is required; the property holds for any field $F$: This is false, because when $\\text{char}(F)=5$, counterexamples to complete reducibility exist.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete condition is that the characteristic of $F$ does not divide 5.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1808016"}, {"introduction": "When the conditions of Maschke's theorem are met, the guarantee of complete reducibility is not just an abstract promise; it stems from a concrete, constructive procedure.
