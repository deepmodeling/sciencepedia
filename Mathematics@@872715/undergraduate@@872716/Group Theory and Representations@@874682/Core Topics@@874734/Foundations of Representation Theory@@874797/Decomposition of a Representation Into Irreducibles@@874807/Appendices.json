The group $G$ acts on the complex vector space $V = \\mathbb{C}^2$ in the natural way, where for any vector $v \\in \\mathbb{C}^2$ and any group element $g \\in G$, the action is given by matrix-vector multiplication $g v$.

It is reducible but cannot be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible representations.\n\nE. The matrices $A$ and $B$ do not generate a finite group, so the concept of this representation is ill-defined.", "solution": "We analyze the group generated by\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\-1&0\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad B=\\begin{pmatrix}i&0\\\\0&-i\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nFirst, compute the powers:\n$$\nA^{2}=\\begin{pmatrix}-1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{pmatrix}=-I, \\qquad B^{2}=\\begin{pmatrix}-1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{pmatrix}=-I,\n$$\nso $A^{4}=I$ and $B^{4}=I$. Next, compute the conjugation relation:\n$$\nAB=\\begin{pmatrix}0&-i\\\\-i&0\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad A^{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad ABA^{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix}-i&0\\\\0&i\\end{pmatrix}=-B=B^{-1}.\n$$\nThus $ABA^{-1}=B^{-1}$ and $A^{2}=B^{2}=-I$ is central. It follows that the subgroup generated by $A$ and $B$ is finite; in fact, it has at most the eight elements\n$$\n\\{\\pm I,\\ \\pm A,\\ \\pm B,\\ \\pm AB\\},\n$$\nand these are distinct since $A$ and $B$ do not commute (indeed $AB=-BA$). Hence $G$ is finite (isomorphic to the quaternion group of order $8$). Therefore, over $\\mathbb{C}$ (characteristic zero), Maschke’s theorem applies, so every representation of $G$ is completely reducible. This immediately rules out option D, and option E is false since $G$ is finite.\n\nWe now determine whether the given $2$-dimensional representation is reducible. A $2$-dimensional complex representation is reducible if and only if it has a nontrivial $1$-dimensional invariant subspace (a $G$-stable line). Any such line must be invariant under both $A$ and $B$.\n\nSince $B$ is diagonal, its eigenvectors are\n$$\ne_{1}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{with eigenvalue } i, \\qquad e_{2}=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{with eigenvalue } -i.\n$$\nThus the only $B$-invariant lines are $\\operatorname{span}\\{e_{1}\\}$ and $\\operatorname{span}\\{e_{2}\\}$. Check $A$ on these lines:\n$$\nA e_{1}=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\-1\\end{pmatrix}=-e_{2}\\notin \\operatorname{span}\\{e_{1}\\}, \\qquad A e_{2}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}=e_{1}\\notin \\operatorname{span}\\{e_{2}\\}.\n$$\nTherefore, no $1$-dimensional subspace is invariant under both $A$ and $B$, so there is no nontrivial invariant line. Hence the representation is irreducible. Consequently, the correct choice is that it is an irreducible $2$-dimensional representation.\n\nThus the correct answer is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1611681"}, {"introduction": "Once a representation is known to be reducible, the next step is to find its irreducible components.
