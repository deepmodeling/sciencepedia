{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our exploration of Burnside's Lemma, let's start with a clear and intuitive example involving only rotational symmetry. This problem challenges us to count the distinct ways to decorate a pentagonal table, which simplifies the group of symmetries to the cyclic group $C_5$. By focusing on rotations, we can master the fundamental process of identifying the configurations left unchanged by each group element, a core skill for applying the lemma [@problem_id:1779952].", "problem": "A team is preparing for a banquet and needs to decorate a large, regular pentagonal table. The five straight sides of the table are to be adorned with decorative banners. There are two types of banners available: one is colored crimson and the other is gold. A decoration scheme consists of choosing one banner for each of the five sides of the table. Two decoration schemes are considered identical if one can be rotated to look exactly like the other. How many distinct decoration schemes are possible?", "solution": "This is a counting problem under symmetry, which can be solved using Burnside's Lemma. Let $X$ be the set of all possible ways to choose a banner for each of the five sides without considering any symmetry. Let $C$ be the number of colors available, which is $C=2$ (crimson and gold). Since there are 5 sides, the total number of possible coloring schemes is $|X| = C^5 = 2^5 = 32$.\n\nLet $G$ be the group of rotational symmetries of a regular pentagon. This group is the cyclic group of order 5, denoted $C_5$. The elements of $G$ are the rotations of the pentagon about its center by multiples of $\\frac{2\\pi}{5}$ radians (or $72^\\circ$). The elements are:\n1.  $g_0$: Rotation by $0^\\circ$ (the identity element).\n2.  $g_1$: Rotation by $72^\\circ$.\n3.  $g_2$: Rotation by $144^\\circ$.\n4.  $g_3$: Rotation by $216^\\circ$.\n5.  $g_4$: Rotation by $288^\\circ$.\n\nThe order of the group is $|G|=5$.\n\nBurnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct configurations (orbits) is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of distinct schemes} = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} |\\text{Fix}(g)| $$\nwhere $|\\text{Fix}(g)|$ is the number of colorings in $X$ that are left unchanged (fixed) by the action of the group element $g$. We need to calculate $|\\text{Fix}(g)|$ for each element $g \\in G$.\n\n1.  **$g = g_0$ (Rotation by $0^\\circ$)**: The identity rotation leaves every side in its original position. Therefore, all $32$ possible colorings are unchanged by this rotation.\n    $|\\text{Fix}(g_0)| = 2^5 = 32$.\n\n2.  **$g = g_1$ (Rotation by $72^\\circ$)**: For a coloring scheme to be unchanged by a $72^\\circ$ rotation, the color of each side must be the same as the color of the side it rotates into. This means side 1 must have the same color as side 2, side 2 the same as side 3, and so on. This creates a single cycle of all 5 sides: $(1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 5 \\to 1)$. For the coloring to be invariant, all five sides must have the same color. Since there are 2 colors (crimson and gold), there are 2 such schemes: all crimson or all gold.\n    $|\\text{Fix}(g_1)| = 2$.\n\n3.  **$g = g_2$ (Rotation by $144^\\circ$)**: This rotation sends side 1 to side 3, side 3 to side 5, side 5 to side 2, side 2 to side 4, and side 4 back to side 1. The permutation of the sides is the 5-cycle $(1 \\to 3 \\to 5 \\to 2 \\to 4 \\to 1)$. Similar to the $72^\\circ$ rotation, for a coloring to be invariant under this rotation, all five sides must have the same color.\n    $|\\text{Fix}(g_2)| = 2$.\n\n4.  **$g = g_3$ (Rotation by $216^\\circ$)**: This rotation is the inverse of the $144^\\circ$ rotation. It permutes the sides as the 5-cycle $(1 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 3 \\to 1)$. Again, for a coloring to be invariant, all five sides must have the same color.\n    $|\\text{Fix}(g_3)| = 2$.\n\n5.  **$g = g_4$ (Rotation by $288^\\circ$)**: This rotation is the inverse of the $72^\\circ$ rotation. It permutes the sides as the 5-cycle $(1 \\to 5 \\to 4 \\to 3 \\to 2 \\to 1)$. For a coloring to be invariant, all five sides must be the same color.\n    $|\\text{Fix}(g_4)| = 2$.\n\nNow, we apply Burnside's Lemma by summing the sizes of the fixed sets and dividing by the order of the group:\n$$ \\text{Number of distinct schemes} = \\frac{1}{5} (|\\text{Fix}(g_0)| + |\\text{Fix}(g_1)| + |\\text{Fix}(g_2)| + |\\text{Fix}(g_3)| + |\\text{Fix}(g_4)|) $$\n$$ \\text{Number of distinct schemes} = \\frac{1}{5} (32 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2) $$\n$$ \\text{Number of distinct schemes} = \\frac{1}{5} (40) $$\n$$ \\text{Number of distinct schemes} = 8 $$\nThere are 8 distinct decoration schemes possible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "1779952"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered rotational symmetry, we now advance to a more complex scenario that includes reflections.
