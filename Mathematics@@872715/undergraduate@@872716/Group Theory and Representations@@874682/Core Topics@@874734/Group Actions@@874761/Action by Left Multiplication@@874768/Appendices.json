Let this common cycle length be $m = |g|$.\n\nSince the disjoint cycles of the permutation partition the set of elements of $G$, if there are $k$ such cycles, the total number of elements in the group must be the product of the number of cycles and the length of each cycle.\n$$|G| = k \\times m = k \\times |g|$$\nThis means the number of cycles in the permutation $\\pi_g$ is $k = \\frac{|G|}{|g|}$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of a single transposition. A single transposition on the set $G$ (of size $n$) is a permutation that swaps two elements, say $a$ and $b$, and leaves every other element fixed. Its cycle decomposition is $(a \\ b)$, followed by $n-2$ fixed points, which are cycles of length 1. For example, $(c), (d), \\dots$.\nSo, the cycle structure of a single transposition consists of one cycle of length 2 and $n-2$ cycles of length 1.\n\nWe want to find the condition under which $\\pi_g$ can be a single transposition. We must equate the two descriptions of the permutation's structure.\n\nThe permutation $\\pi_g$ has all its cycles of the same length, $|g|$.\nA single transposition has cycles of two different lengths (length 2 and length 1), unless there are no cycles of one of these types.\n\nLet's reconcile these two structural descriptions. For the structure of $\\pi_g$ to match that of a single transposition, all its cycles must be of the same length. This leaves two possibilities:\n\n1.  All cycles are of length 1. If all cycles of the single transposition were of length 1, there would be no cycle of length 2. This is the identity permutation. For $\\pi_g$, this would mean $|g|=1$, which implies $g=e$. However, the problem specifies we are considering a non-identity element $g \\neq e$. So this case is ruled out.\n\n2.  All cycles are of length 2. For a single transposition's cycle structure to consist only of cycles of length 2, there must be no cycles of length 1 (i.e., no fixed points). The number of fixed points is $n-2$. Setting this to zero gives:\n    $$n-2 = 0 \\implies n = |G| = 2$$\nIf $|G|=2$, then the permutation is on a set of two elements. A single transposition on a set of two elements has one cycle of length 2 and $2-2=0$ fixed points. Its cycle structure consists only of a single cycle of length 2.\n\nLet's check if this is consistent with the structure of $\\pi_g$.\nIf $|G|=2$, let the group be $G = \\{e, a\\}$. The only non-identity element is $g=a$. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element must divide the order of the group, so $|a|$ must divide 2. Since $a \\neq e$, its order cannot be 1, so $|a|=2$.\n\nAccording to the theorem for $\\pi_g$:\n- The length of all cycles in $\\pi_a$ must be $|a|=2$.\n- The number of cycles must be $k = \\frac{|G|}{|a|} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$.\n\nSo, for a group of order 2, the permutation $\\pi_a$ (where $a$ is the non-identity element) consists of exactly one cycle of length 2. This is precisely the definition of a single transposition on a set of 2 elements.\nLet's see it explicitly: $\\pi_a(e) = ae = a$, and $\\pi_a(a) = a^2 = e$. The permutation maps $e \\to a$ and $a \\to e$, which is the transposition $(e \\ a)$.\n\nTherefore, the permutation $\\pi_g$ for a non-identity element $g$ is a single transposition if and only if the group $G$ has order 2.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. $G$ is any group of even order greater than 2. This is false. Consider the Klein-four group $G = V_4$ which has order 4. Any non-identity element $g$ has order 2. The permutation $\\pi_g$ consists of $\\frac{|G|}{|g|} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$ cycles of length 2 (i.e., two disjoint transpositions).
