Let $G = GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_3)$ denote the General Linear group of degree 2, which is the group of all invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrices with entries in $\\mathbb{F}_3$, under matrix multiplication.\n\nThe group $G$ acts on the vector space $V$ via the natural action of matrix-vector multiplication. For a given vector $v \\in V$, its stabilizer (also known as the isotropy subgroup) in $G$, denoted $\\text{Stab}_G(v)$, is the set of all matrices $M \\in G$ such that $Mv = v$.\n\nDetermine the order of the stabilizer subgroup for the vector $v_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in V$.", "solution": "We work over $\\mathbb{F}_{3}$ and consider $G = GL_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{3})$ acting on $V = \\mathbb{F}_{3}^{2}$ by left multiplication.

The condition $M v_{0} = v_{0}$ is equivalent to\n$$\nu + w = v_{0}.\n$$\nInvertibility of $M$ is equivalent to the columns $u$ and $w$ being linearly independent over $\\mathbb{F}_{3}$.\n\nWe count admissible pairs $(u,w)$ with $u + w = v_{0}$ and $\\{u,w\\}$ linearly independent. For each choice of $u \\in V \\setminus \\{0\\}$, $w$ is determined uniquely by $w = v_{0} - u$. Independence requires that $w$ is neither zero nor a scalar multiple of $u$.\n\n- If $u = v_{0}$, then $w = v_{0} - u = 0$, which is not allowed since the columns would be dependent.\n- If $u = 2 v_{0}$, then $w = v_{0} - 2 v_{0} = -v_{0} = 2 v_{0}$, so $w$ is a scalar multiple of $u$, again dependent.\n\nMore generally, if $u$ lies in the $1$-dimensional subspace $\\text{span}(v_{0})$, i.e., $u = \\lambda v_{0}$ with $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_{3}^{\\times}$, then $w = v_{0} - u = (1 - \\lambda) v_{0}$ also lies in $\\text{span}(v_{0})$, making $u$ and $w$ dependent.

Therefore, the number of choices for $u$ with $u \\notin \\text{span}(v_{0})$ is\n$$\n8 - 2 = 6.\n$$\nFor each such $u$, $w = v_{0} - u$ is nonzero and not a scalar multiple of $u$ (otherwise $v_{0} = u + w$ would lie in $\\text{span}(u)$, contradicting $u \\notin \\text{span}(v_{0})$).
