A powerful tool for this is the concept of a \"fiber,\" which is the set of all input elements that map to a single output element. This exercise challenges you to connect the core properties of a function—injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity—to the size and nature of its fibers, revealing how these sets partition the domain. [@problem_id:1673257]", "problem": "Let $f: X \\to Y$ be a function between two non-empty sets, $X$ and $Y$. For any element $y$ in the codomain $Y$, we define the fiber of $y$ under $f$ as the set of its preimages, denoted by $f^{-1}(y) = \\{x \\in X \\mid f(x) = y\\}$. The cardinality of a finite set $S$ is denoted by $|S|$. A collection of non-empty subsets of $X$ is said to form a partition of $X$ if the subsets are pairwise disjoint and their union is equal to $X$.\n\nConsider the following five statements about the function $f$. Four of these statements are always true, and one is not necessarily true. Identify the statement that is NOT always true.\n\nA.

If the function $f$ is surjective, then the collection of all its fibers, $\\{f^{-1}(y) \\mid y \\in Y\\}$, forms a partition of the domain $X$.\n\nD. If the function $f$ is injective, then the collection of all its fibers, $\\{f^{-1}(y) \\mid y \\in Y\\}$, forms a partition of the domain $X$.\n\nE. The function $f$ is bijective (a one-to-one correspondence) if and only if for every $y \\in Y$, its fiber $f^{-1}(y)$ is a singleton set (a set with exactly one element).", "solution": "We analyze each statement, using the definition of fiber $f^{-1}(y)=\\{x\\in X\\mid f(x)=y\\}$ and the definition that a partition is a collection of non-empty, pairwise disjoint subsets whose union is $X$.\n\nA. Injectivity is equivalent to the condition that distinct elements of $X$ never map to the same $y\\in Y$. This is equivalent to requiring that for every $y\\in Y$, the fiber $f^{-1}(y)$ has at most one element. Formally, if $f$ is injective and $y\\in Y$, then either $y$ is not in the image and $|f^{-1}(y)|=0$, or there exists a unique $x$ with $f(x)=y$ and then $|f^{-1}(y)|=1$, so $|f^{-1}(y)|\\le 1$. Conversely, if for every $y\\in Y$ we have $|f^{-1}(y)|\\le 1$, and if $f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})=y$, then both $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ lie in $f^{-1}(y)$, forcing $x_{1}=x_{2}$. Hence $f$ is injective. Thus A is always true.\n\nB. Surjectivity means that for every $y\\in Y$ there exists $x\\in X$ with $f(x)=y$, which is exactly the condition that $f^{-1}(y)\\neq\\varnothing$ for all $y\\in Y$. Conversely, if $f^{-1}(y)\\neq\\varnothing$ for all $y\\in Y$, then for each $y$ there exists $x$ with $f(x)=y$, so $f$ is surjective. Thus B is always true.\n\nC. For any function (no hypothesis needed), fibers corresponding to distinct $y$ are pairwise disjoint: if $x\\in f^{-1}(y_{1})\\cap f^{-1}(y_{2})$, then $f(x)=y_{1}$ and $f(x)=y_{2}$, hence $y_{1}=y_{2}$. Moreover, $\\bigcup_{y\\in Y}f^{-1}(y)=X$ because for each $x\\in X$, $x\\in f^{-1}(f(x))$. The only possible violation of being a partition is having empty sets among the fibers. If $f$ is surjective, then for every $y\\in Y$ there exists $x$ with $f(x)=y$, so each $f^{-1}(y)$ is non-empty. Therefore, under surjectivity, the collection $\\{f^{-1}(y)\\mid y\\in Y\\}$ consists of non-empty, pairwise disjoint sets whose union is $X$, i.e., it forms a partition. Thus C is always true.\n\nD. If $f$ is injective, then as observed, fibers are pairwise disjoint and their union over all $y\\in Y$ is $X$. However, injectivity does not imply surjectivity. If $f$ is not surjective, then there exists $y_{0}\\in Y$ with $f^{-1}(y_{0})=\\varnothing$. Since a partition must be a collection of non-empty subsets, the collection $\\{f^{-1}(y)\\mid y\\in Y\\}$ fails to be a partition in this case. Hence the statement “If $f$ is injective, then the collection of all its fibers forms a partition of $X$” is not always true. It holds only if $f$ is also surjective. Thus D is not necessarily true.\n\nE. If $f$ is bijective, then it is injective and surjective, so for each $y\\in Y$ the fiber is non-empty (surjectivity) and has at most one element (injectivity), hence exactly one element, i.e., a singleton. Conversely, if every fiber $f^{-1}(y)$ is a singleton, then each is non-empty (so $f$ is surjective) and has size at most one (so $f$ is injective). Therefore $f$ is bijective. Thus E is always true.\n\nTherefore, the unique statement that is not always true is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1673257"}, {"introduction": "We now move from general functions to a specific, important type: permutations.
