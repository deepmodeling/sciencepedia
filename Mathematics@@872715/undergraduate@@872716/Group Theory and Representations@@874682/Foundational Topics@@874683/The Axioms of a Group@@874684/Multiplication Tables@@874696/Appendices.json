Hence D is not a commutative loop.\n\nOption B:\nIdentity holds as the first row and first column reproduce the headers: $e*x=x*e=x$ for all $x\\in S$. Each row and column is a permutation of $S$ (e.g., row $a$ is $a,e,c,b,f,d$; row $b$ is $b,c,d,f,a,e$; similarly for all rows and columns), so the Latin square property holds; thus it is a loop. The table is symmetric across the main diagonal, so $a*b=b*a$ for all $a,b$, i.e., it is commutative. To show it is not a group, we exhibit a failure of associativity. For example, testing the triple $(b, c, d)$:\n$$ (b*c)*d = f*d = c $$\n$$ b*(c*d) = b*e = b $$\nSince $b \\neq c$, associativity fails.
