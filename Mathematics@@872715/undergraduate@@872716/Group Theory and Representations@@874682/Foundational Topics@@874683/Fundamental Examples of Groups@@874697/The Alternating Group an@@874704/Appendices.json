Each element of this group is called a permutation. A permutation is called a *transposition* if it swaps two elements and leaves all others fixed. Any non-identity permutation can be written as a product of transpositions. A permutation is called *even* if it can be written as a product of an even number of transpositions, and *odd* if it can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions.
