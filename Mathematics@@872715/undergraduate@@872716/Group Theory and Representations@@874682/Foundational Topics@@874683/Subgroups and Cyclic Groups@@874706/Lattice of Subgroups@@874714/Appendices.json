Let's call them $G_c$ (the cyclic group) and $G_k$ (the non-cyclic, abelian group, also known as the Klein four-group). The set of all subgroups of a group $G$, when partially ordered by the subgroup inclusion relation ($\\subseteq$), forms a structure called the subgroup lattice, denoted $L(G)$.

The divisors of $4$ are $1,2,4$, so $G_{c}$ has exactly the subgroups $\\{e\\}$ (order $1$), the unique subgroup of order $2$ (namely $\\langle a^{2}\\rangle$ if $G_{c}=\\langle a\\rangle$), and $G_{c}$ itself.

First, I show that $G$ must be cyclic. Let $m$ be the maximum order of an element in $G$ and choose $g \\in G$ with $|\\langle g \\rangle|=m$. For any $y \\in G$, the chain condition implies either $\\langle y \\rangle \\subseteq \\langle g \\rangle$ or $\\langle g \\rangle \\subseteq \\langle y \\rangle$.

If $|G|=n$ and $G$ is cyclic, then its subgroups correspond bijectively to the positive divisors of $n$, ordered by divisibility. The poset of divisors of $n$ is a chain if and only if $n$ is a power of a prime. Indeed, if $n$ has two distinct prime divisors $p$ and $q$, then the divisors $p$ and $q$ are incomparable, yielding subgroups of orders $p$ and $q$ that are not contained in one another, contradicting the chain condition. Conversely, if $n=p^{k}$, then the divisors are exactly $p^{i}$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq k$ and are linearly ordered, and a cyclic group has exactly one subgroup of each order dividing $n$, so the subgroup lattice is a chain. Therefore $G$ is cyclic of order $p^{k}$ for some prime $p$ and integer $k \\geq 1$.\n\nFrom this classification, the required properties follow. Since $G$ is cyclic, it is abelian, so $A$ holds. The order of $G$ is a power of a prime, so $D$ holds. In a cyclic group of order $p^{k}$ there is exactly one subgroup of order $p^{i}$ for each $0 \\leq i \\leq k$, in particular a unique subgroup of order $p^{k-1}$, which is maximal; hence $E$ holds and the maximal subgroup is unique. The order need not be prime unless $k=1$, so $B$ is not necessary. The order cannot be a product of two distinct primes because that would violate the chain condition as shown above, so $F$ is false. The Klein four-group is not cyclic and has three distinct subgroups of order $2$ that are pairwise incomparable, so it cannot be a chain group; thus $G$ is not isomorphic to the Klein four-group, making G false.
