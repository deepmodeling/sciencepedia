The group generated by a set $S$ is denoted as $\\langle S \\rangle$.\n\nLet $S_n$ be the symmetric group on $n$ elements, which is the group of all permutations of the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$. The alternating group, $A_n$, is the subgroup of $S_n$ containing all even permutations. A permutation is even if it can be written as a product of an even number of transpositions (2-cycles). For example, a 3-cycle like $(a,b,c)$ is an even permutation because it can be written as the product of two transpositions: $(a,b,c) = (a,c)(a,b)$.\n\nA computer science student is exploring minimal generating sets for the alternating group on four elements, $A_4$. They have proposed four different subsets of permutations. Your task is to determine which of these subsets generate the entire group $A_4$.\n\nThe proposed subsets are:\nA. $S_A = \\{(1,2,3), (1,3,2)\\}$\nB. $S_B = \\{(1,2)(3,4), (1,3)(2,4)\\}$\nC. $S_C = \\{(1,2,3), (1,2,4)\\}$\nD. $S_D = \\{(1,2,3), (2,3,4)\\}$\n\nIdentify all the subsets that generate $A_4$.", "solution": "We use the standard convention that permutation composition is performed right-to-left, and we work in $S_4$ with the subgroup $A_4$ consisting of the identity, the three double transpositions, and the eight 3-cycles. A subset generates $A_4$ if it produces all these even permutations.\n\nSet A: $S_A=\\{(1,2,3),(1,3,2)\\}$. Since $(1,3,2)=(1,2,3)^{-1}$, we have $\\langle S_A \\rangle=\\langle(1,2,3)\\rangle=\\{e,(1,2,3),(1,3,2)\\}$, a cyclic subgroup of order $3$. Hence $S_A$ does not generate $A_4$.\n\nSet B: $S_B=\\{(1,2)(3,4),(1,3)(2,4)\\}$. These are distinct nontrivial elements of the Klein four subgroup $V_4=\\{e,(1,2)(3,4),(1,3)(2,4),(1,4)(2,3)\\}$. Since any two distinct non-identity elements of $V_4$ generate $V_4$, we have $\\langle S_B \\rangle=V_4$, which has order $4$. Hence $S_B$ does not generate $A_4$.\n\nSet C: $S_C=\\{a,b\\}$ with $a=(1,2,3)$ and $b=(1,2,4)$. First, we can produce another 3-cycle on a different support:\n$$\na b^{-1}=(1,2,3)(1,4,2) = (1,4,3)\n$$\nNext, we can produce a double transposition:\n$$\n(1,4,3)(1,2,3) = (1,2)(3,4)\n$$\nBy conjugating this double transposition by $a$, we can generate the other two double transpositions:\n$$\na(1,2)(3,4)a^{-1}=(a(1),a(2))(a(3),a(4))=(2,3)(1,4)=(1,4)(2,3)\n$$\nand\n$$\na^{2}(1,2)(3,4)a^{-2}=(a^{2}(1),a^{2}(2))(a^{2}(3),a^{2}(4))=(3,1)(2,4)=(1,3)(2,4)\n$$\nWe can also generate all the other 3-cycles. For instance:\n$$\nb a^{-1}=(1,2,4)(1,3,2)=(1,3,4)\n$$\nand then\n$$\na(1,3,4)=(1,2,3)(1,3,4)=(2,3,4)\n$$\nTaking inverses gives both orientations for each 3-cycle. Since we can generate all eight 3-cycles and all three double transpositions, we have generated all of $A_4$.

Concretely, for any word $w$ formed by a product of the generators $\\sigma^{\\pm 1}$ and $\\tau^{\\pm 1}$, we have $w(5)=5$. Hence, every element $h\\in H=\\langle \\sigma,\\tau\\rangle$ satisfies $h(5)=5$. This means that $H$ is a subgroup of the point stabilizer of 5 in $A_5$:\n$$\nH \\subseteq \\{g\\in A_5 \\mid g(5)=5\\}\n$$\nThe set on the right-hand side consists of all even permutations of the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, which is a group isomorphic to $A_4$.\n\nHowever, the group $A_5$ contains many even permutations that do not fix the element 5.

Therefore, the subgroup $H$ cannot be equal to the entire group $A_5$.\n\nThis reasoning directly corresponds to option D, which is the most accurate and fundamental reason.

This doesn't provide a general rule.\n*   E makes a correct statement that $H$ is isomorphic to $A_4$, which is a subgroup of $A_5$, but this is a reason why $H$ *could* be a subgroup, not a reason why it *is* the entire group.
