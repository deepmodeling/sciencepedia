Consider a permutation $\\sigma \\in S_7$. The disjoint cycle decomposition of $\\sigma$ consists of exactly one cycle of length 3 and one cycle of length 4. Determine the sign of the permutation $\\sigma$, which is denoted by $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$.", "solution": "The sign of a permutation, $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$, is a value that indicates whether the permutation is even ($+1$) or odd ($-1$). To determine the sign of the given permutation $\\sigma$, we will use two fundamental properties of permutations and their cycle decompositions.\n\nFirst, if a permutation is written as a product of disjoint cycles, its sign is the product of the signs of those individual cycles. In this problem, the permutation $\\sigma$ is a product of a 3-cycle, let's call it $c_3$, and a 4-cycle, $c_4$. Since these cycles are disjoint, we can write $\\sigma = c_3 c_4$. Therefore, the sign of $\\sigma$ is given by:\n$$\n\\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = \\text{sgn}(c_3) \\times \\text{sgn}(c_4)\n$$\n\nSecond, the sign of a cycle of length $k$ (a $k$-cycle) is given by the formula $(-1)^{k-1}$. A $k$-cycle is an even permutation if $k-1$ is even (i.e., $k$ is odd), and an odd permutation if $k-1$ is odd (i.e., $k$ is even). This formula arises from the fact that any $k$-cycle can be decomposed into a product of $k-1$ transpositions (2-cycles).\n\nNow, we apply this second property to find the signs of $c_3$ and $c_4$.\n\nFor the 3-cycle, $c_3$, the length is $k=3$. Its sign is:\n$$\n\\text{sgn}(c_3) = (-1)^{3-1} = (-1)^2 = 1\n$$\nSo, the 3-cycle is an even permutation.\n\nFor the 4-cycle, $c_4$, the length is $k=4$. Its sign is:\n$$\n\\text{sgn}(c_4) = (-1)^{4-1} = (-1)^3 = -1\n$$\nSo, the 4-cycle is an odd permutation.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the sign of the total permutation $\\sigma$ by multiplying the signs of its disjoint cycle components:\n$$\n\\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = \\text{sgn}(c_3) \\times \\text{sgn}(c_4) = (1) \\times (-1) = -1\n$$\n\nThus, the permutation $\\sigma$ is an odd permutation, and its sign is $-1$. The fact that the permutation is in $S_7$ is consistent with its cycle structure, as the 3-cycle and the 4-cycle operate on a total of $3+4=7$ distinct elements.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "1641179"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple calculation, the sign function possesses a crucial algebraic property: it is a group homomorphism from the symmetric group $S_n$ to the multiplicative group $\\{+1, -1\\}$. This means the sign of a product of permutations is the product of their signs. This practice problem [@problem_id:1839554] explores a direct consequence of this property, showing how it simplifies finding the sign of a permutation that has been applied repeatedly.", "problem": "In a simplified model of a quantum information system, a device known as a Discrete Phase Scrambler (DPS) is used to reorder a set of $N$ distinct energy states, labeled $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. The specific rearrangement performed by the DPS in a single operational cycle is described by a permutation $\\sigma$ on this set of labels.\n\nA key characteristic of any such permutation is a property called its 'configurational parity', which can take a value of either $+1$ or $-1$. This value is defined to be $+1$ if the permutation can be achieved by an even number of simple pair-swaps (transpositions), and $-1$ if it requires an odd number of such swaps.\n\nA particular DPS is configured with a base permutation $\\sigma$ which is known to have a configurational parity of $-1$. The device is programmed to run for 1001 consecutive identical cycles. The total transformation after these cycles is described by the permutation $\\sigma^{1001}$, which represents applying the permutation $\\sigma$ a total of 1001 times.\n\nWhat is the configurational parity of the total transformation $\\sigma^{1001}$?", "solution": "Let the configurational parity be represented by the sign homomorphism $\\operatorname{sgn}: S_{N} \\to \\{+1,-1\\}$, where $\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)=+1$ if $\\sigma$ is an even permutation and $\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)=-1$ if $\\sigma$ is an odd permutation. A fundamental property is multiplicativity under composition:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sgn}(\\tau \\circ \\rho)=\\operatorname{sgn}(\\tau)\\operatorname{sgn}(\\rho).\n$$\nApplying this repeatedly to a power $\\sigma^{k}=\\sigma \\circ \\sigma \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\sigma$ (with $k$ factors) yields\n$$\n\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma^{k})=\\left(\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)\\right)^{k}.\n$$\nGiven $\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)=-1$ and $k=1001$,\n$$\n\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma^{1001})=\\left(-1\\right)^{1001}=-1.\n$$\nThus the total transformation after 1001 cycles is an odd permutation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "1839554"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves from computation to conceptual reasoning, challenging you to link two key characteristics of a permutation: its order and its sign. By using the given order of a permutation, you must first deduce its underlying cycle structure and then use that structure to determine its sign.

In $S_{10}$, a $15$-cycle is impossible because it would exceed $10$ elements. Thus the allowed cycle lengths are $1,3,5$. To have $\\operatorname{lcm}(l_{1},\\dots,l_{r})=15$, there must be at least one $3$-cycle and at least one $5$-cycle; if all lengths divided $5$ the lcm would be $5$, and if all divided $3$ the lcm would be $3$.\n\nThe total number of moved points is the sum of the cycle lengths, which must equal $10$.
