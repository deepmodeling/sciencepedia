A standard presentation for this group is given by $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^4 = s^2 = 1, sr = r^{-1}s \\rangle$. Let $N$ be the center of $G$, denoted $Z(G)$. Since the center of any group is a normal subgroup, the quotient group $G/N$ is well-defined.\n\nWhat is the order of the center of this quotient group, $|Z(G/N)|$?", "solution": "The problem asks for the order of the center of the quotient group $G/N$, where $G = D_8$ and $N = Z(D_8)$. We will solve this in a few steps: first, we find the center of $D_8$; second, we analyze the structure of the resulting quotient group; and third, we determine the center of this quotient group and its order.\n\n**Step 1: Find the center of $G = D_8$.**\nThe group $D_8$ has 8 elements: $\\{e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3\\}$, where $e=1$ is the identity. The center $Z(G)$ consists of all elements $g \\in G$ that commute with every element of $G$. It is sufficient to check which elements commute with the generators $r$ and $s$.\n\nLet's test the powers of $r$. An element $r^k$ is in the center if $r^k r = r r^k$ (which is always true) and $r^k s = s r^k$.\nUsing the relation $sr = r^{-1}s$, we can deduce $s r^k = r^{-k} s$.\nSo, for $r^k$ to be in the center, we need $r^k s = s r^k$, which means $r^k s = r^{-k} s$. This simplifies to $r^k = r^{-k}$, or $r^{2k} = e$.\nSince the order of $r$ is 4, this means $2k$ must be a multiple of 4. For $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, the possible values are $k=0$ (which gives $r^0=e$) and $k=2$ (which gives $r^4=e$).\nThus, $e$ and $r^2$ are the only powers of $r$ in the center.\n\nNow let's test elements of the form $sr^k$. Such an element is in the center if it commutes with $r$ and $s$.\nLet's check commutation with $r$: $(sr^k)r = sr^{k+1}$.\nAnd $r(sr^k) = (rs)r^k = (s r^{-1})r^k = sr^{k-1}$.\nFor these to be equal, we need $sr^{k+1} = sr^{k-1}$, which implies $r^{k+1} = r^{k-1}$, or $r^2=e$. This is a contradiction, as the order of $r$ is 4.\nTherefore, no element of the form $sr^k$ can be in the center of $D_8$.\n\nCombining our findings, the center of $D_8$ is $Z(D_8) = \\{e, r^2\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the quotient group $G/N$.**\nFrom Step 1, the normal subgroup is $N = Z(G) = \\{e, r^2\\}$.\nThe order of this subgroup is $|N|=2$.\nThe order of the quotient group $G/N$ is $|G/N| = |G|/|N| = 8/2 = 4$.\nAny group of order 4 is abelian. Therefore, the quotient group $G/N$ must be abelian.\n\nTo be fully explicit, let's examine the elements and their interactions. The elements of $G/N$ are the cosets of $N$:\n$N = \\{e, r^2\\}$ (the identity element of $G/N$)\n$rN = \\{r, r^3\\}$\n$sN = \\{s, sr^2\\}$\n$srN = \\{sr, sr^3\\}$\n\nLet's check if the generators of the quotient, $rN$ and $sN$, commute.\n$(rN)(sN) = rsN$\n$(sN)(rN) = srN$\n\nWe need to check if $rsN = srN$. This is true if and only if $(sr)^{-1}(rs) \\in N$.\n$(sr)^{-1}(rs) = (r^{-1}s^{-1})(rs) = (r^3s)(rs)$ since $r^{-1}=r^3$ and $s^{-1}=s$.\n$(r^3s)(rs) = r^3(sr)s = r^3(r^{-1}s)s = r^3r^{-1}s^2 = r^2e = r^2$.\nSince $r^2 \\in N$, we have $(sr)^{-1}(rs) \\in N$, which confirms that the cosets $rsN$ and $srN$ are identical. Thus, $(rN)(sN) = (sN)(rN)$.\nSince the generators of the quotient group commute, the group $G/N$ is abelian.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the center of $G/N$ and its order.**\nThe center of any group $H$, denoted $Z(H)$, is the set of elements that commute with all elements of $H$. If a group $H$ is abelian, then every element commutes with every other element by definition. Therefore, the center of an abelian group is the group itself.\n$Z(H) = H$ if $H$ is abelian.\n\nIn our case, the group is $G/N$, which we have shown to be abelian.\nTherefore, its center is the entire group: $Z(G/N) = G/N$.\n\nThe question asks for the order of this center.\n$|Z(G/N)| = |G/N|$.\nAs calculated in Step 2, the order of the quotient group is 4.\nSo, $|Z(G/N)| = 4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1649576"}]}
