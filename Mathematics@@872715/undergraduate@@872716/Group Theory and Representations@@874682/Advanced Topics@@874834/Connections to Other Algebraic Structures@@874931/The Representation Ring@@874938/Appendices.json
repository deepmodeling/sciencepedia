It can be defined by its generators and relations as $V_4 = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = e, b^2 = e, ab = ba \\rangle$, where $e$ is the identity element. The distinct elements of the group are $\\{e, a, b, ab\\}$.\n\nThe irreducible complex representations of $V_4$ are all 1-dimensional and are also known as its characters. A character is a group homomorphism $\\chi: V_4 \\to \\mathbb{C}^\\times$, where $\\mathbb{C}^\\times$ is the multiplicative group of non-zero complex numbers. Since every non-identity element in $V_4$ has order 2, the value of any character on such an element must be either $1$ or $-1$. A character is fully determined by its values on the generators $a$ and $b$. Let us denote the four irreducible characters by $\\chi_{i,j}$, where $i = \\chi(a)$ and $j = \\chi(b)$ for $i,j \\in \\{1, -1\\}$. The set of irreducible characters is thus $\\{\\chi_{1,1}, \\chi_{-1,1}, \\chi_{1,-1}, \\chi_{-1,-1}\\}$. Note that $\\chi_{1,1}$ is the trivial character, which maps all group elements to 1.\n\nThe representation ring of $V_4$, denoted $R(V_4)$, is constructed from these irreducible characters. The multiplication operation in this ring is defined by the tensor product of representations. For two 1-dimensional characters, $\\chi$ and $\\psi$, their product in $R(V_4)$ corresponds to the character $(\\chi \\psi)$ defined by pointwise multiplication: $(\\chi \\psi)(g) = \\chi(g) \\psi(g)$ for any element $g \\in V_4$.

This problem asks you to compare the representation rings of two non-isomorphic groups of order four: the cyclic group $C_4$ and the Klein four-group $V$.
