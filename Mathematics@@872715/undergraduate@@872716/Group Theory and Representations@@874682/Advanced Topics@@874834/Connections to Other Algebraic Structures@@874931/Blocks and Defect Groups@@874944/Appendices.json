Since we have shown that $B$ is not a block of defect zero, we cannot conclude this is true. In fact, this statement is equivalent to statement A in terms of block properties, so it is false.\n\nC.

The defect of block $B$ is greater than zero.\nThe defect of a block, $d$, is a non-negative integer. A block is of defect zero if $d=0$. Since we have established that block $B$ is not of defect zero, its defect $d$ cannot be $0$. Therefore, $d$ must be a positive integer, i.e., $d > 0$.

In our case $p=7$. We have $d>0$, so $\\nu_7(|G|) \\le \\nu_7(\\chi(1)) + d$. We are given $\\chi(1)=12$. Thus $\\nu_7(\\chi(1)) = \\nu_7(12) = 0$. The condition becomes $\\nu_7(|G|) \\le d$. This puts no constraint on $\\chi(1)$ itself being divisible by $p=7$, let alone $p^2=49$. Option E is not necessarily true. For example, the trivial character lies in the principal block, whose defect group is a Sylow $p$-subgroup, so its defect is positive (if $p$ divides $|G|$), but its degree is 1.\n\nBased on our analysis, the only statement that must be true is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1600895"}, {"introduction": "While all characters in a block share a common defect group, they are not identical.
