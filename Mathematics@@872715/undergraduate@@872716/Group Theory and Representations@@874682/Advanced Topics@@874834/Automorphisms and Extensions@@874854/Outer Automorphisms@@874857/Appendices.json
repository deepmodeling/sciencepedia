We will analyze each option systematically. First, we recall the important isomorphism theorem that $\\text{Inn}(G) \\cong G / Z(G)$, where $Z(G)$ is the center of $G$.\n\nLet's examine option A: The symmetric group $S_3$.\n$S_3$ is a non-abelian group of order $3! = 6$. The center of $S_3$ is trivial, $Z(S_3) = \\{e\\}$, where $e$ is the identity permutation. Therefore, the group of inner automorphisms is $\\text{Inn}(S_3) \\cong S_3 / Z(S_3) \\cong S_3 / \\{e\\} \\cong S_3$. The order of $\\text{Inn}(S_3)$ is 6. It is a known result that for any symmetric group $S_n$ with $n \\neq 2, 6$, the automorphism group is isomorphic to the group itself, i.e., $\\text{Aut}(S_n) \\cong S_n$. Thus, $\\text{Aut}(S_3) \\cong S_3$. The outer automorphism group is then $\\text{Out}(S_3) = \\text{Aut}(S_3) / \\text{Inn}(S_3) \\cong S_3 / S_3$, which is the trivial group containing only one element. Since the problem requires $\\text{Out}(G)$ to be non-trivial, $S_3$ is not the correct answer.\n\nLet's examine option B: The dihedral group $D_4$.\n$D_4$ is the group of symmetries of a square, which consists of 4 rotations and 4 reflections. It is a non-abelian group of order 8. Let $r$ be the rotation by $\\pi/2$ and $s$ be a reflection. The center of $D_4$ consists of the elements that commute with all other elements. This is $Z(D_4) = \\{e, r^2\\}$, where $r^2$ is the rotation by $\\pi$. The order of the center is $|Z(D_4)|=2$. The group of inner automorphisms is $\\text{Inn}(D_4) \\cong D_4 / Z(D_4)$, which has order $|D_4| / |Z(D_4)| = 8 / 2 = 4$. This quotient group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$, which is an abelian group. An automorphism of $D_4$ is determined by its action on the generators $r$ and $s$. The generator $r$ has order 4, and must be mapped to an element of order 4; the options are $r$ and $r^3$. The generator $s$ has order 2 and must be mapped to an element of order 2 that is not in the center; there are 4 such elements ($s, sr, sr^2, sr^3$). These choices give a total of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ possible automorphisms. So, $|\\text{Aut}(D_4)| = 8$. The order of the outer automorphism group is $|\\text{Out}(D_4)| = |\\text{Aut}(D_4)| / |\\text{Inn}(D_4)| = 8 / 4 = 2$. Any group of order 2 is isomorphic to the cyclic group $C_2$, which is abelian. Furthermore, a group of order 2 is non-trivial. Therefore, $D_4$ satisfies all the conditions.\n\nLet's examine option C: The quaternion group $Q_8$.\n$Q_8$ is a non-abelian group of order 8. Its center is $Z(Q_8) = \\{1, -1\\}$, which has order 2. The inner automorphism group is $\\text{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong Q_8 / Z(Q_8)$, which has order $8/2=4$. Like for $D_4$, this group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $V_4$. It is a standard result of group theory that the automorphism group of the quaternions is isomorphic to the symmetric group on 4 elements, $\\text{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$. The order of $\\text{Aut}(Q_8)$ is $|S_4|=24$. The order of the outer automorphism group is $|\\text{Out}(Q_8)| = |\\text{Aut}(Q_8)| / |\\text{Inn}(Q_8)| = 24 / 4 = 6$. There are only two groups of order 6, the cyclic group $C_6$ (abelian) and the symmetric group $S_3$ (non-abelian). It can be shown that $\\text{Out}(Q_8) \\cong S_3$. Since $S_3$ is non-abelian, $Q_8$ does not satisfy the condition that its outer automorphism group must be abelian.\n\nLet's examine option D: The symmetric group $S_4$.\n$S_4$ is a non-abelian group of order $4! = 24$. The center of $S_4$ is trivial, $Z(S_4) = \\{e\\}$. Thus, $\\text{Inn}(S_4) \\cong S_4 / Z(S_4) \\cong S_4$. The order of $\\text{Inn}(S_4)$ is 24. As stated for option A, for $n \\neq 2, 6$, $\\text{Aut}(S_n) \\cong S_n$. Hence, $\\text{Aut}(S_4) \\cong S_4$. The outer automorphism group is $\\text{Out}(S_4) = \\text{Aut}(S_4) / \\text{Inn}(S_4) \\cong S_4 / S_4$, which is the trivial group. This fails the \"non-trivial\" condition.\n\nBased on the analysis of all options, only the dihedral group $D_4$ is a non-abelian group with an outer automorphism group that is both non-trivial and abelian.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1633635"}]}
