Both $\\text{CH}_4$ and $\\text{CD}_4$ possess perfect tetrahedral geometry and belong to $T_{d}$. Isotopic substitution (H to D) does not alter the molecular geometry or the point group. The symmetry species of the normal modes are determined by how nuclear displacements transform under the symmetry operations, which depends only on geometry (i.e., the point group), not on atomic masses. Therefore the vibrational representation and its decomposition into irreducible representations are unchanged by full deuteration. For a tetrahedral $XY_{4}$ molecule, the vibrational representation decomposes as\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}=A_{1}\\oplus E\\oplus 2T_{2},\n$$\nwhich accounts for $1+2+3+3=9$ vibrational degrees of freedom.\n\n3) Raman activity from the character table. A vibrational mode is Raman-active if its symmetry species transforms as at least one quadratic function. From the provided $T_{d}$ character table, the quadratic functions transform as $A_{1}$, $E$, and $T_{2}$. Since $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$ contains only $A_{1}$, $E$, and $T_{2}$, all vibrational modes in $\\text{CH}_4$ are Raman-active. Because isotopic substitution to $\\text{CD}_4$ does not change $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$, the same set of symmetries appears, and the same selection rule applies.\n\n4) Effect of isotopic substitution. Changing H to D alters masses and thus the normal-mode frequencies and may alter Raman intensities via changes in the derivatives of the polarizability with respect to normal coordinates. However, it does not change the point group, the number of modes, or the symmetry species of the modes. Therefore, the total number of Raman-active vibrational modes remains the same for $\\text{CD}_4$ and $\\text{CH}_4$.\n\nHence, the correct choice is that the number of Raman-active modes remains the same because isotopic substitution does not change the number of atoms or the molecular point group.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1640845"}, {"introduction": "Group theory is not just a predictive tool; it is essential for interpreting experimental data.
