Therefore:\n- $77=7\\cdot 11$ involves two primes, hence any group of order $77$ is solvable, so not non-abelian simple.\n- $125=5^{3}$ is a $p$-group; any nontrivial $p$-group has nontrivial center and is not simple unless of prime order.

If there are at least two distinct Sylow $2$-subgroups, then the total number of nonidentity $2$-elements is at least $5$: each subgroup contributes $3$ nonidentity elements, and two distinct subgroups of order $4$ intersect in a subgroup of order at most $2$, so the union contains at least $3+3-1=5$ distinct nonidentity elements. However, there are only $3$ nonidentity elements left unaccounted for, a contradiction.

Burnside's theorem guarantees that a group of order $p^a q^b$ is solvable, but does this imply stronger structural properties? This exercise delves into the specific structure of the affine group $AGL(1, 5)$ to explore the distinction between solvability and nilpotency, providing a concrete example that illuminates the exact scope of the theorem's conclusion. [@problem_id:1601847]", "problem": "In abstract algebra, the properties of a finite group are deeply connected to its order. Consider the group $G$ consisting of all functions $f: \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_5$ of the form $f(x) = ax+b$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5$ and $a \\neq 0 \\pmod 5$. The group operation is function composition. This group is known as the Affine General Linear group of dimension 1 over the field of 5 elements, denoted $AGL(1, 5)$.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, we use the following standard definitions:\n1.  A group $H$ is **solvable** if there exists a chain of subgroups $\\{e\\} = H_0 \\subseteq H_1 \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq H_k = H$ such that for each $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\}$, $H_i$ is a normal subgroup of $H_{i+1}$, and the quotient group $H_{i+1}/H_i$ is abelian.

The group elements are functions $f(x) = ax+b$ where $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and $b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the order of the group $G$. An element of $G$ is uniquely determined by the choice of $a$ and $b$. There are 4 choices for $a$ (since $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5^* = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$) and 5 choices for $b$ (since $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5 = \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$). Thus, the order of the group is $|G| = 4 \\times 5 = 20$.\n\nWe can write the order as $|G|=20=2^2 \\cdot 5^1$. This is of the form $p^a q^b$ with primes $p=5, q=2$ and integers $a=1, b=2$.\n\n**Analysis of Solvability:**\nThe problem statement mentions Burnside's $p^a q^b$ Theorem, which states that any group of order $p^a q^b$ is solvable. Since the order of $G$ is $20 = 5^1 \\cdot 2^2$, we can directly apply this theorem to conclude that $G$ is solvable.\n\nAlternatively, we can show solvability by constructing a suitable subnormal series. Let $T$ be the subset of $G$ corresponding to translations, i.e., functions of the form $f(x) = x+b$ (where $a=1$). This corresponds to pairs $(1, b)$ for $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5$. $T$ is a subgroup of $G$ and is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_5$, so it is abelian and has order 5.\nLet's check if $T$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Let $g(x)=ax+c$ be an arbitrary element of $G$ and $t(x)=x+b$ be an element of $T$. The inverse of $g$ is $g^{-1}(y) = a^{-1}(y-c)$. We compute the conjugate $g \\circ t \\circ g^{-1}$:\n$$\n(g \\circ t \\circ g^{-1})(y) = g(t(g^{-1}(y))) = g(t(a^{-1}(y-c))) = g((a^{-1}(y-c))+b) = a((a^{-1}(y-c))+b) + c = (y-c) + ab + c = y+ab.\n$$\nThe resulting function $f(y) = y+ab$ is a translation, so it is in $T$. Thus, $T$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\nNow consider the quotient group $G/T$. The order of this quotient group is $|G/T| = |G|/|T| = 20/5 = 4$. Any group of order 4 is abelian (isomorphic to either $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$).\nWe have the subnormal series $\\{e\\} \\unlhd T \\unlhd G$. The factor groups are $T/\\{e\\} \\cong T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5$ (which is abelian) and $G/T$ (which is of order 4, and thus abelian). Since all the factor groups in the series are abelian, the group $G$ is solvable by definition.\n\n**Analysis of Nilpotency:**\nA finite group is nilpotent if and only if all its Sylow subgroups are normal. The order of $G$ is $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1$. The Sylow subgroups are of order $2^2=4$ and $5^1=5$.\n\nLet's consider the Sylow 5-subgroups. Let $n_5$ be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups. According to Sylow's theorems, $n_5$ must divide $|G|/|P_5| = 20/5 = 4$, and $n_5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. The only integer satisfying both conditions is $n_5=1$. Since there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be normal. We have already seen this subgroup; it is the group of translations $T$.\n\nNow let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. Let $n_2$ be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups. Their order is $2^2=4$. According to Sylow's theorems, $n_2$ must divide $|G|/|P_2| = 20/4 = 5$, and $n_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. The possible values for $n_2$ are $1$ and $5$.\nIf $n_2=1$, the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal. If $n_2=5$, the Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal. A group is nilpotent if and only if all its Sylow subgroups are normal. So $G$ is nilpotent if and only if $n_2=1$.\n\nLet's find a Sylow 2-subgroup. Consider the set of \"dilations\" $D$, which are functions of the form $f(x)=ax$ (where $b=0$). These correspond to pairs $(a,0)$ for $a \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. This set forms a subgroup isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}_5)^* \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_4$. The order of $D$ is 4, so it is a Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nTo check if $G$ is nilpotent, we check if $D$ is a normal subgroup. Let's conjugate an element of $D$ by an element not in $D$. Let $d(x)=ax$ with $a \\neq 1$ be in $D$, and let $g(x)=x+b$ with $b \\neq 0$ be in $T$ (a subgroup of $G$). The inverse of $g$ is $g^{-1}(y)=y-b$.\nThe conjugate is:\n$$\n(g \\circ d \\circ g^{-1})(y) = g(d(g^{-1}(y))) = g(d(y-b)) = g(a(y-b)) = a(y-b)+b = ay -ab+b.\n$$\nThe resulting function is $f(y) = ay + b(1-a)$. This corresponds to the pair $(a, b(1-a))$. Since we chose $a \\neq 1$ and $b \\neq 0$, the constant term $b(1-a)$ is non-zero in $\\mathbb{Z}_5$. For example, take $a=2$ and $b=1$. The conjugate element corresponds to $(2, 1(1-2)) = (2, -1) = (2, 4)$.\nThe element $(2,4)$ is not in $D$, since elements of $D$ have the form $(a,0)$. Thus, $gDg^{-1} \\neq D$. The Sylow 2-subgroup $D$ is not normal in $G$.\nSince not all Sylow subgroups are normal, the group $G$ is not nilpotent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe group $G=AGL(1,5)$ is solvable but not nilpotent.
