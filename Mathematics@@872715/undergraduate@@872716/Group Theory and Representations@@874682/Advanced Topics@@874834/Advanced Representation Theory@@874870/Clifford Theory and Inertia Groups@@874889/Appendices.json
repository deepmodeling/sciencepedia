Provide your answer as a sequence of three integers corresponding to these three orders, respectively.", "solution": "The problem asks for the orders of three inertia groups: $|I_G(\\psi_1)|$, $|I_G(\\psi_3)|$, and $|I_G(\\psi_1 \\psi_3)|$, where $G=D_8$ and $N=\\langle r \\rangle \\cong C_4$. The characters are given by $\\psi_k(r^j) = i^{kj}$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the inertia group $I_G(\\psi_1)$. The inertia group is a subgroup of $G$. We begin by checking which elements of $G$ stabilize $\\psi_1$.\nThe group $N = \\{e, r, r^2, r^3\\}$ is an abelian subgroup of $G$. For any element $n' \\in N$ and any $n \\in N$, we have $n' n (n')^{-1} = n$. Therefore, the action of any $n' \\in N$ on any character $\\psi$ of $N$ is trivial: $\\psi^{n'}(n) = \\psi(n' n (n')^{-1}) = \\psi(n)$. This implies $\\psi^{n'} = \\psi$. So, the inertia group $I_G(\\psi_1)$ must contain $N$.\nNow we must check the elements of $G$ that are not in $N$. These are the elements in the coset $sN = \\{s, sr, sr^2, sr^3\\}$. It is sufficient to check the action of a single representative, for instance, $s$.\nLet's compute the character $\\psi_1^s$. For any element $r^j \\in N$:\n$$ \\psi_1^s(r^j) = \\psi_1(s r^j s^{-1}) $$\nUsing the relation $sr=r^{-1}s$, we have $srs^{-1}=r^{-1}$. Thus, $s r^j s^{-1} = (srs^{-1})^j = (r^{-1})^j = r^{-j}$.\nSo, the action of $s$ on the argument is conjugation, yielding:\n$$ \\psi_1^s(r^j) = \\psi_1(r^{-j}) = i^{1 \\cdot (-j)} = i^{-j} $$\nWe need to compare $\\psi_1^s$ with $\\psi_1$. The character $\\psi_1$ is given by $\\psi_1(r^j) = i^j$. For $j=1$, $\\psi_1^s(r) = i^{-1} = -i$, while $\\psi_1(r) = i$. Since $-i \\neq i$, we have $\\psi_1^s \\neq \\psi_1$.\nTherefore, $s$ is not in $I_G(\\psi_1)$. Since $I_G(\\psi_1)$ is a subgroup of $G$ containing $N$ but not containing $s$, it cannot be $G$. By Lagrange's theorem, the only subgroup of $G$ that properly contains $N$ (a subgroup of index 2) is $G$ itself. Thus, we must have $I_G(\\psi_1) = N$.\nThe order is $|I_G(\\psi_1)| = |N| = 4$.\n\nNext, we determine the inertia group $I_G(\\psi_3)$. The same reasoning shows that $N \\subseteq I_G(\\psi_3)$. We check the action of $s$:\n$$ \\psi_3^s(r^j) = \\psi_3(s r^j s^{-1}) = \\psi_3(r^{-j}) = i^{3 \\cdot (-j)} = i^{-3j} $$\nSince $i^{-3j} = (i^4)i^{-3j} = i^{4-3j}$ and character values only depend on the exponent modulo 4, we evaluate $i^{-3j}$. Note that $i^{-3j} = (i^{-3})^j = (i)^j = i^j$.\nSo, $\\psi_3^s(r^j) = i^j = \\psi_1(r^j)$. This means $\\psi_3^s = \\psi_1$.\nSince $\\psi_3^s \\neq \\psi_3$, the element $s$ is not in $I_G(\\psi_3)$.\nBy the same logic as for $\\psi_1$, the inertia group must be $I_G(\\psi_3) = N$.\nThe order is $|I_G(\\psi_3)| = |N| = 4$.\n\nFinally, we determine the inertia group $I_G(\\psi_1 \\psi_3)$. First, we must identify the character $\\phi = \\psi_1 \\psi_3$. We evaluate it on the elements of $N$:\n$$ \\phi(r^j) = (\\psi_1 \\psi_3)(r^j) = \\psi_1(r^j) \\psi_3(r^j) = (i^j)(i^{3j}) = i^{j+3j} = i^{4j} = (i^4)^j = 1^j = 1. $$\nThe character $\\phi$ maps every element of $N$ to 1, which means it is the trivial character of $N$, $\\psi_0$. So we need to calculate $I_G(\\psi_0)$.\nThe trivial character $\\psi_0$ is defined by $\\psi_0(n) = 1$ for all $n \\in N$. Let's test its stability under the action of an arbitrary element $g \\in G$:\n$$ \\psi_0^g(n) = \\psi_0(gng^{-1}) = 1. $$\nThis is because $N$ is a normal subgroup, so $gng^{-1} \\in N$, and $\\psi_0$ maps every element of $N$ to 1.\nSo, $\\psi_0^g(n) = \\psi_0(n)$ for all $n \\in N$, which means $\\psi_0^g = \\psi_0$. This holds for any $g \\in G$.\nTherefore, the inertia group of the trivial character is the entire group $G$.\n$$ I_G(\\psi_1 \\psi_3) = I_G(\\psi_0) = G = D_8. $$\nThe order is $|I_G(\\psi_1 \\psi_3)| = |G| = 8$.\n\nIn summary, the orders of the three inertia groups are:\n$|I_G(\\psi_1)| = 4$\n$|I_G(\\psi_3)| = 4$\n$|I_G(\\psi_1 \\psi_3)| = 8$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 4 & 8 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1607091"}]}
