Consider the free group $F_2$ generated by the set $\\{a, b\\}$. The elements of this group are \"words\" formed by concatenating the generators and their formal inverses, $a^{-1}$ and $b^{-1}$. For example, $ab a^{-1}b^2$ is a word in $F_2$. We use exponents to denote repeated letters, e.g., $a^2 = aa$ and $a^{-2} = a^{-1}a^{-1}$.\n\nA word is said to be \"freely reduced\" if it contains no adjacent pairs of a generator and its inverse, such as $aa^{-1}$, $a^{-1}a$, $bb^{-1}$, or $b^{-1}b$. Any word can be transformed into a unique freely reduced form by repeatedly finding and removing such pairs. For example, the word $b a b b^{-1} a^{-1}$ reduces to $b a a^{-1}$, which further reduces to the word $b$. The identity element of the group is the empty word, which is the result of reducing a word like $b a a^{-1} b^{-1}$.\n\nThe \"commutator\" of two elements $u$ and $v$ in a group is defined as $[u, v] = uvu^{-1}v^{-1}$.\n\nGiven the two words $u = bab$ and $v = a^2b$ in $F_2$, determine the freely reduced form of their commutator $[u, v]$.", "solution": "We work in the free group on generators $a$ and $b$.

The procedure is to find the first undefined entry in the lowest-numbered row (scanning columns in the order $r, r^{-1}, s$) and assign it a new, unused integer label starting with 2.\n3.  **Deduction Steps**: After a new coset is defined, the algorithm proceeds with deduction steps. A \"deduction step\" is defined as filling a single empty cell in the table by one of two mechanisms:\n    (a) applying a relator to an existing coset, which uniquely determines the entry (a \"relator-based deduction\").\n    (b) filling in the action of an inverse generator, $j \\cdot g^{-1} = i$, immediately after a relation $i \\cdot g = j$ is established (a \"pair-consequence deduction\").\n\nFollowing this procedure, perform the initial setup, define the first new coset (which will be labeled as coset 2), and then carry out the first two subsequent deduction steps in the order they become possible.\n\nWhat are the entries in the second row of the coset table after these steps have been completed?
