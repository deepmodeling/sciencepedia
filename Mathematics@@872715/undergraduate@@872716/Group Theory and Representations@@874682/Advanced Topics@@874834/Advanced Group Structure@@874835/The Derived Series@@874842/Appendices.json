Their composition is:\n$(T_{c,d} \\circ T_{a,b})(x) = T_{c,d}(T_{a,b}(x)) = T_{c,d}(ax+b) = c(ax+b)+d = (ca)x + (cb+d)$.\nSo, in our pair notation, the group operation is $(c,d) \\cdot (a,b) = (ca, cb+d)$.\n\nThe identity element is the transformation that does nothing, $e(x) = x$. This corresponds to $T_{1,0}$, or the pair $(1,0)$.\n\nTo find the inverse of $T_{a,b}$, say $T_{a',b'}$, we must have $T_{a',b'} \\circ T_{a,b} = T_{1,0}$.\nThis corresponds to $(a',b') \\cdot (a,b) = (a'a, a'b+b') = (1,0)$.\nThis gives us a system of two equations:\n1. $a'a = 1 \\implies a' = 1/a$.\n2. $a'b+b' = 0 \\implies (1/a)b+b' = 0 \\implies b' = -b/a$.\nSo, the inverse of $T_{a,b}$ is $T_{1/a, -b/a}$.

Then $a,c \\neq 0$ is satisfied. The expression for $\\beta$ becomes:\n$\\beta = (2d+0-d-0)/(2 \\cdot 1) = d/2$.\nSince $d$ can be any real number, $d/2$ can also be any real number.
