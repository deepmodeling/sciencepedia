A non-empty subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup if and only if for any two elements $a, b \\in H$, the element $ab^{-1}$ is also in $H$.

Since $1^5 = 1$, $1 \\in S_A$. Thus, the set is non-empty.\n2.  **Closure and Inverses**: Let's use the one-step subgroup test. Let $a, b \\in S_A$. By definition, $a^5 = 1$ and $b^5 = 1$. The inverse of $b$ in $U(1)$ is $b^{-1} = 1/b$. We need to check if $ab^{-1} \\in S_A$.
