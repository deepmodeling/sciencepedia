A geodesic is a curve $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ that extremizes the arc length functional, which is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[\\gamma] = \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}(t)^{2} + \\dot{y}(t)^{2}}}{y(t)} \\, dt\n$$\nThe integrand is the Lagrangian for this variational problem:\n$$\nL(y, \\dot{x}, \\dot{y}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}}}{y}\n$$\nThe geodesics are the solutions to the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $L$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}}}{y^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} = \\frac{1}{y} \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}} = \\frac{1}{y} \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}}}\n$$\nThe EL equation for $x$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\dot{x}}{y\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the quantity in the parentheses is a constant, which we denote by $C_{1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot{x}}{y\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}}} = C_{1}\n$$\nWe analyze two cases based on the value of $C_{1}$.\n\nCase 1: $C_{1} = 0$.\nIf $C_{1} = 0$, then $\\dot{x}(t) = 0$ for all $t$ (since $y>0$). This means $x(t) = x_{0}$ for some constant $x_{0}$. The curve is a vertical line. The EL equation for $y$ must also be satisfied. With $\\dot{x}=0$, the Lagrangian simplifies to $L = |\\dot{y}|/y$.

Thus, vertical lines $x = x_{0}$ are a family of geodesics.\n\nCase 2: $C_{1} \\neq 0$.\nIn this case, $\\dot{x} \\neq 0$, so we can parameterize the curve by $x$, treating $y$ as a function of $x$.

Since we are in the upper half-plane ($y>0$), these geodesics are semicircles whose centers lie on the $x$-axis.\n\nIn summary, the geodesics of the hyperbolic plane in the upper half-plane model are Euclidean vertical lines and semicircles orthogonal to the $x$-axis.\n\n**Part 2: Justification from First Variation**\n\nThe first variation of the functional $\\mathcal{L}$ is defined as $\\delta\\mathcal{L} = \\left. \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon}\\mathcal{L}[\\gamma_{\\epsilon}] \\right|_{\\epsilon=0}$, where $\\gamma_{\\epsilon}(t) = \\gamma(t) + \\epsilon \\eta(t) = (x(t)+\\epsilon\\eta_{x}(t), y(t)+\\epsilon\\eta_{y}(t))$ is a one-parameter family of curves, and the variation vector field $\\eta(t) = (\\eta_{x}(t), \\eta_{y}(t))$ vanishes at the endpoints, i.e., $\\eta(t_{0}) = \\eta(t_{1}) = 0$.\nThe derivative of the integrand $L(\\gamma_\\epsilon, \\dot{\\gamma}_\\epsilon)$ with respect to $\\epsilon$ at $\\epsilon=0$ is:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon} \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\dot{x}+\\epsilon\\dot{\\eta}_x)^2 + (\\dot{y}+\\epsilon\\dot{\\eta}_y)^2}}{y+\\epsilon\\eta_y} \\right|_{\\epsilon=0}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule and product rule, and letting $v = \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2+\\dot{y}^2}$:\n$$\n= \\left[ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} \\eta_x + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} \\eta_y + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\dot{\\eta}_x + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}} \\dot{\\eta}_y \\right]_{\\gamma, \\dot{\\gamma}}\n$$\nThe first variation is the integral of this expression:\n$$\n\\delta\\mathcal{L} = \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} \\eta_x + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} \\eta_y + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\dot{\\eta}_x + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}} \\dot{\\eta}_y \\right) dt\n$$\nWe apply integration by parts to the terms containing derivatives of $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\dot{\\eta}_x \\, dt = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\eta_x \\right]_{t_0}^{t_1} - \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}}\\right) \\eta_x \\, dt\n$$\nThe boundary term vanishes because $\\eta_x(t_0) = \\eta_x(t_1) = 0$. A similar result holds for the $\\dot{\\eta}_y$ term.

According to the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations, this integral is zero for all smooth vector fields $\\eta$ vanishing at the endpoints if and only if the coefficients of $\\eta_x$ and $\\eta_y$ are identically zero. That is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} - \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}}\\right) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThese are precisely the Euler-Lagrange equations. This argument demonstrates from first principles that the critical curves for the arc length functional are exactly the solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations derived in Part 1.\n\n**Part 3: Specific Geodesic**\n\nWe need to find the unique geodesic connecting the points $p_{1} = (-1,1)$ and $p_{2} = (1,1)$.\nFrom Part 1, we know the geodesics are either vertical lines ($x=$ const) or semicircles centered on the $x$-axis ($(x-x_0)^2 + y^2 = R^2, y>0$).\nSince the points $p_1$ and $p_2$ have different $x$-coordinates ($-1$ and $1$), the geodesic connecting them cannot be a vertical line. It must therefore be a semicircle.\nThe equation of the semicircle is $(x-x_{0})^{2} + y^{2} = R^{2}$. We find the constants $x_{0}$ and $R$ by requiring the curve to pass through both $p_1$ and $p_2$.\nFor $p_{1}=(-1,1)$:\n$$\n(-1-x_{0})^{2} + (1)^{2} = R^{2} \\implies (1+x_{0})^{2} + 1 = R^{2} \\quad (1)\n$$\nFor $p_{2}=(1,1)$:\n$$\n(1-x_{0})^{2} + (1)^{2} = R^{2} \\implies (1-x_{0})^{2} + 1 = R^{2} \\quad (2)\n$$\nFrom equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, we can set the left-hand sides equal:\n$$\n(1+x_{0})^{2} + 1 = (1-x_{0})^{2} + 1\n$$\n$$\n(1+x_{0})^{2} = (1-x_{0})^{2}\n$$\n$$\n1 + 2x_{0} + x_{0}^{2} = 1 - 2x_{0} + x_{0}^{2}\n$$\n$$\n4x_{0} = 0 \\implies x_{0} = 0\n$$\nThe center of the semicircle is at the origin $(0,0)$. To find the radius $R$, we substitute $x_{0}=0$ into either equation. Using equation $(2)$:\n$$\n(1-0)^{2} + 1 = R^{2} \\implies 1+1 = R^{2} \\implies R^{2} = 2\n$$\nThe equation of the geodesic is $x^{2} + y^{2} = 2$ (for $y > 0$).\nThe problem asks for the analytic expression $F(x,y)$ such that the geodesic is the zero set $F(x,y)=0$.\nThis expression is:\n$$\nF(x,y) = x^{2} + y^{2} - 2\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x^{2} + y^{2} - 2}\n$$", "id": "3046214"}, {"introduction": "The first variation of arc length serves as a powerful tool not only for finding geodesics but also for testing whether a given curve is one.

First Variations**\nThe varied curve $\\gamma_\\varepsilon$ has length $L(\\varepsilon) = |(V-P) + \\varepsilon u| + |(Q-V) - \\varepsilon u|$. The first variation is $\\frac{dL}{d\\varepsilon}$ at $\\varepsilon=0$. Using the rule $\\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon}|v_0+\\varepsilon w|_{\\varepsilon=0} = \\langle \\frac{v_0}{|v_0|}, w \\rangle$, we find:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dL}{d\\varepsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0} = \\left\\langle \\frac{V-P}{|V-P|}, u \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle \\frac{Q-V}{|Q-V|}, -u \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{V-P}{|V-P|} - \\frac{Q-V}{|Q-V|}, u \\right\\rangle.\n$$\nThe unit vectors along the segments are $\\frac{(1,1)}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $\\frac{(1,-1)}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The vector in the inner product, representing the \"tension\" at the corner, is:\n$$\nT_V = \\frac{(1,1)}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{(1,-1)}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\left(0, \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = (0, \\sqrt{2}).\n$$\nThe first variation of length is $\\langle T_V, u \\rangle = \\langle (0, \\sqrt{2}), u \\rangle$. To achieve the most rapid decrease in length, the unit vector $u$ must be anti-parallel to $T_V$. Thus, $u = -(0,1) = (0, -1)$.\nWith this choice, the first variation of length is:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0} L(\\gamma_\\varepsilon) = \\langle (0, \\sqrt{2}), (0, -1) \\rangle = -\\sqrt{2}.\n$$\nSince the varied curve is also parameterized by arc length, the relation $E(\\gamma_\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} L(\\gamma_\\varepsilon)$ holds. Differentiating with respect to $\\varepsilon$ at $\\varepsilon=0$ gives the first variation of energy:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0} E(\\gamma_\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left.\\frac{dL}{d\\varepsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0} = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\sqrt{2}) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\n$$\nThe four computed values are $2\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{2}$, $-\\sqrt{2}$, and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2\\sqrt{2} & \\sqrt{2} & -\\sqrt{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3046245"}]}
