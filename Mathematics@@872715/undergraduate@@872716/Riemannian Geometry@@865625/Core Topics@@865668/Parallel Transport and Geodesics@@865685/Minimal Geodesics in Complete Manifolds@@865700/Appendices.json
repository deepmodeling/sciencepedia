Proof of the Lower Bound**\n\nWe aim to show that for any such curve $\\gamma$, its length satisfies $L(\\gamma) \\geq \\ln(4)$. We use a fundamental inequality. For any real numbers $x'(t)$ and $y'(t)$, we have $x'(t)^{2} \\geq 0$, which implies $x'(t)^{2} + y'(t)^{2} \\geq y'(t)^{2}$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $\\sqrt{x'(t)^{2} + y'(t)^{2}} \\geq \\sqrt{y'(t)^{2}} = |y'(t)|$.\n\nSubstituting this into the length integral:\n$$L(\\gamma) = \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{\\sqrt{x'(t)^{2} + y'(t)^{2}}}{y(t)} \\, dt \\geq \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{|y'(t)|}{y(t)} \\, dt$$\nSince $y(t) > 0$ on $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$, we can use the property that for any integrable function $f$, $\\int_{a}^{b} |f(t)| \\, dt \\geq |\\int_{a}^{b} f(t) \\, dt|$. Applying this with $f(t) = \\frac{y'(t)}{y(t)}$, we get:\n$$\\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{|y'(t)|}{y(t)} \\, dt \\geq \\left| \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{y'(t)}{y(t)} \\, dt \\right|$$\nThe integral $\\int \\frac{y'(t)}{y(t)} dt$ can be solved by a change of variable $u=y(t)$, $du=y'(t)dt$, yielding $\\ln|y(t)|$. Since $y(t) > 0$, this is $\\ln(y(t))$.\nTherefore,\n$$L(\\gamma) \\geq \\left| [\\ln(y(t))]_{a}^{b} \\right| = |\\ln(y(b)) - \\ln(y(a))|$$\nUsing the boundary conditions $y(a)=3$ and $y(b)=12$:\n$$L(\\gamma) \\geq |\\ln(12) - \\ln(3)| = \\left| \\ln\\left(\\frac{12}{3}\\right) \\right| = |\\ln(4)|$$\nSince $\\ln(4) > 0$, we conclude that $L(\\gamma) \\geq \\ln(4)$. This proves the first part of the problem.\n\n**2. Exhibition of the Minimizing Geodesic**\n\nThe inequality $L(\\gamma) \\geq \\ln(4)$ becomes an equality if the two inequalities used in the derivation are equalities.\nThe first inequality, $\\sqrt{x'(t)^{2} + y'(t)^{2}} \\geq |y'(t)|$, becomes an equality if and only if $x'(t)^{2} = 0$, which means $x'(t)=0$ for almost every $t$. This implies that $x(t)$ must be a constant. Since the curve must pass through $p=(2,3)$ and $q=(2,12)$, this constant must be $2$. So, the curve must be a vertical line segment given by $x(t)=2$.\nThe second inequality, $\\int |f| \\geq |\\int f|$, becomes an equality if $f(t) = \\frac{y'(t)}{y(t)}$ does not change sign. Since $y(b)=12 > y(a)=3$, $y(t)$ must be non-decreasing, so $y'(t) \\geq 0$.\n\nLet us consider the curve $\\gamma(t) = (2, t)$ for $t \\in [3,12]$. This curve has $x(t)=2$ and $y(t)=t$. It connects $p=(2,3)$ to $q=(2,12)$.\nLet's compute its length:\n$x'(t)=0$ and $y'(t)=1$.\n$$L(\\gamma) = \\int_{3}^{12} \\frac{\\sqrt{0^{2} + 1^{2}}}{t} \\, dt = \\int_{3}^{12} \\frac{1}{t} \\, dt = [\\ln t]_{3}^{12} = \\ln(12) - \\ln(3) = \\ln(4)$$\nThis curve attains the minimum possible length, so it is a minimizing geodesic.\n\nTo be fully rigorous, we must verify this curve satisfies the geodesic equation. The geodesic equation is $\\frac{d^{2}x^{k}}{d\\tau^{2}} + \\Gamma^{k}_{ij} \\frac{dx^{i}}{d\\tau} \\frac{dx^{j}}{d\\tau} = 0$, where $\\tau$ is an affine parameter (like arc length).\nFirst, we compute the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_{i} g_{jl} + \\partial_{j} g_{il} - \\partial_{l} g_{ij})$.\nLet $(x^{1}, x^{2}) = (x,y)$. The metric and its inverse are $g_{ij} = \\frac{1}{y^{2}}\\delta_{ij}$ and $g^{ij} = y^{2}\\delta_{ij}$.\nThe non-zero derivatives of the metric components are $\\partial_{y}g_{11} = -2/y^{3}$ and $\\partial_{y}g_{22}=-2/y^{3}$.\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n$\\Gamma^{1}_{12} = \\Gamma^{1}_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_{y} g_{11}) = \\frac{1}{2} y^{2} (-\\frac{2}{y^{3}}) = -\\frac{1}{y}$\n$\\Gamma^{2}_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (-\\partial_{y} g_{11}) = \\frac{1}{2} y^{2} (\\frac{2}{y^{3}}) = \\frac{1}{y}$\n$\\Gamma^{2}_{22} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_{y} g_{22}) = \\frac{1}{2} y^{2} (-\\frac{2}{y^{3}}) = -\\frac{1}{y}$\nThe geodesic equations are:\n$$x''(\\tau) - \\frac{2}{y(\\tau)} x'(\\tau)y'(\\tau) = 0$$\n$$y''(\\tau) + \\frac{1}{y(\\tau)} (x'(\\tau))^{2} - \\frac{1}{y(\\tau)} (y'(\\tau))^{2} = 0$$\nThe parametrization $\\gamma(t)=(2,t)$ is not affine, as its speed $\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|_{g} = 1/t$ is not constant. We must reparametrize by arc length $s$.\n$$s(\\tau) = \\int_{3}^{\\tau} \\frac{1}{t} dt = \\ln(\\tau) - \\ln(3)$$\nThus $s = \\ln(\\tau/3)$, which implies $\\tau(s) = 3e^{s}$.\nThe arc-length-parametrized curve is $\\gamma(s) = (x(s), y(s)) = (2, 3e^{s})$. The starting point $p$ corresponds to $s=0$ and the endpoint $q$ corresponds to $s=\\ln(4)$.\nFor this curve:\n$x(s) = 2 \\implies x'(s)=0, x''(s)=0$\n$y(s) = 3e^{s} \\implies y'(s)=3e^{s}, y''(s)=3e^{s}$\nSubstituting into the geodesic equations:\nFor the $x$-equation: $0 - \\frac{2}{3e^{s}}(0)(3e^{s}) = 0$. This is satisfied.\nFor the $y$-equation: $3e^{s} + \\frac{1}{3e^{s}}(0)^{2} - \\frac{1}{3e^{s}}(3e^{s})^{2} = 3e^{s} - \\frac{9e^{2s}}{3e^{s}} = 3e^{s} - 3e^{s} = 0$. This is also satisfied.\nThe curve is indeed a geodesic. As it is length-minimizing, it is a minimizing geodesic.\nThe manifold $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$ is a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature ($K=-1$). By the Cartan-Hadamard theorem, any two points are connected by a unique geodesic. Therefore, the vertical line segment from $p$ to $q$ is the unique minimizing geodesic, up to reparametrization.\n\n**3. Orthogonality with the Boundary**\n\nThe geodesic connecting $p=(2,3)$ and $q=(2,12)$ is the line segment defined by $x=2$ for $y \\in [3,12]$. If we extend this geodesic, it becomes the vertical ray $\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x=2, y>0\\}$.\nThis ray meets the boundary of $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$, which is the line $\\{y=0\\}$ (the $x$-axis), at the point $(2,0)$.\nThe problem asks to explain why this intersection is orthogonal in the Euclidean sense.\nA tangent vector to the geodesic ray $x=2$ at any point $(2,y)$ is a vertical vector, for example, $\\vec{v} = (0,1)$.\nA tangent vector to the boundary line $y=0$ at any point $(x,0)$ is a horizontal vector, for example, $\\vec{u} = (1,0)$.\nThe Euclidean angle $\\theta_{E}$ between two vectors $\\vec{u}$ and $\\vec{v}$ is given by $\\cos(\\theta_{E}) = \\frac{\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{\\|\\vec{u}\\|_{E} \\|\\vec{v}\\|_{E}}$.\nIn our case, the Euclidean dot product is $\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v} = (1,0) \\cdot (0,1) = 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$.\nA zero dot product implies that the vectors are orthogonal, so the angle of intersection is $\\pi/2$ radians, or $90$ degrees.\nThe reason this geometric property of geodesics in $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is directly observable in Euclidean terms is because the hyperbolic metric $g = \\frac{1}{y^{2}}(dx^{2}+dy^{2})$ is conformal to the Euclidean metric $g_{E} = dx^{2}+dy^{2}$. A conformal metric is one that is a scalar multiple of another, i.e., $g = f \\cdot g_{E}$ where $f=1/y^2$ is a positive scalar function. A key property of conformal metrics is that they preserve angles. The hyperbolic angle between two intersecting curves is the same as the Euclidean angle between them. Thus, the Euclidean orthogonality directly implies hyperbolic orthogonality. All geodesics in the upper half-plane model are either vertical lines or semicircles centered on the $y=0$ axis, both of which intersect the boundary $y=0$ at right angles in the Euclidean sense.\n\nThe geodesic distance, $d_{g}(p,q)$, is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise $C^{1}$ curves connecting $p$ and $q$. Since we have found a curve that attains the proven lower bound of $\\ln(4)$, this infimum is achieved and is the value of the length.\n$$d_{g}(p,q) = L(\\gamma_{\\text{min}}) = \\ln(4)$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\ln(4)}$$", "id": "3058240"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice examines a space that is locally indistinguishable from the Euclidean plane but globally very different: the flat torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$.
