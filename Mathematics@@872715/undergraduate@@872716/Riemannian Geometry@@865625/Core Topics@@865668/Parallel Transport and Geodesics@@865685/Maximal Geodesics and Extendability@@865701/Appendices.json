It asks for a standard analysis of geodesics on the unit sphere, connecting the intrinsic definition to the properties in the ambient Euclidean space, and dealing with a coordinate singularity. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we analyze the curve $c$ and its relation to great circles and geodesics.\nThe curve $c:(0,\\pi)\\to S^{2}$ is defined in the spherical coordinate chart by $\\theta(t)=t$ and $\\phi(t)=0$. Substituting these into the coordinate map $F(\\theta,\\phi)=\\big(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi,\\ \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi,\\ \\cos\\theta\\big)$, we obtain the explicit representation of the curve in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$:\n$$\nc(t) = F(t,0) = \\big(\\sin(t)\\cos(0),\\ \\sin(t)\\sin(0),\\ \\cos(t)\\big) = \\big(\\sin(t),\\ 0,\\ \\cos(t)\\big)\n$$\nfor $t \\in (0,\\pi)$.\nThe image of this curve is a set of points $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ where $x=\\sin(t)$, $y=0$, and $z=\\cos(t)$. The condition $y=0$ means the curve lies entirely in the $xz$-plane. The coordinates also satisfy $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (\\sin(t))^2 + 0^2 + (\\cos(t))^2 = 1$, confirming the curve lies on the unit sphere $S^2$.\nA great circle on $S^2$ is defined as the intersection of $S^2$ with a plane passing through the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The $xz$-plane, defined by the equation $y=0$, is such a plane. Since the image of $c$ lies in the intersection of $S^2$ and the $xz$-plane, its image is an arc of a great circle.\n\nTo show that great circles are geodesics, we use the property that for a submanifold $M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, a curve $\\gamma:I\\to M$ is a geodesic if and only if its acceleration vector in the ambient space, $\\ddot{\\gamma}(t)$, is everywhere normal to the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(t)}M$. For the sphere $S^2$, the tangent space $T_pS^2$ at a point $p \\in S^2$ is the plane orthogonal to the position vector $p$. Thus, we must show that $\\ddot{\\gamma}(t)$ is parallel to $\\gamma(t)$ for any great circle $\\gamma$ parameterized by arc length.\n\nLet $\\gamma(s)$ be a curve tracing a great circle with unit speed, where $s$ is the arc length parameter. Such a curve can be written as $\\gamma(s) = \\cos(s) v_1 + \\sin(s) v_2$, where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are orthonormal vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ that span the plane of the great circle. Differentiating with respect to $s$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = -\\sin(s) v_1 + \\cos(s) v_2\n$$\nThe speed is $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(s)\\| = \\sqrt{(-\\sin(s))^2 + (\\cos(s))^2} = 1$, so $s$ is indeed the arc length.\nDifferentiating again gives the acceleration vector:\n$$\n\\ddot{\\gamma}(s) = -\\cos(s) v_1 - \\sin(s) v_2 = -\\big(\\cos(s) v_1 + \\sin(s) v_2\\big) = -\\gamma(s)\n$$\nThe acceleration vector $\\ddot{\\gamma}(s)$ is equal to $-\\gamma(s)$, which is parallel to the position vector $\\gamma(s)$ and thus normal to the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(s)}S^2$. The covariant derivative of the velocity field along the curve, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma}$, is the projection of the ambient acceleration $\\ddot{\\gamma}$ onto the tangent space. Since $\\ddot{\\gamma}$ is entirely normal, its tangential projection is the zero vector. Therefore, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$, satisfying the geodesic equation. This demonstrates that all great circles, when parameterized by arc length, are geodesics on $S^2$. The curve $c(t)$ is an arc of such a great circle.\n\nSecond, we justify why the apparent termination is a coordinate artifact.\nIn the ambient space, the limits of the curve $c(t)$ as $t$ approaches the endpoints of its domain are:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to 0^+} c(t) = \\big(\\sin(0),\\ 0,\\ \\cos(0)\\big) = (0,0,1) = N\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\pi^-} c(t) = \\big(\\sin(\\pi),\\ 0,\\ \\cos(\\pi)\\big) = (0,0,-1) = S\n$$\nThe curve smoothly approaches the North and South poles. The given spherical coordinate chart $F:(0,\\pi)\\times(-\\pi,\\pi)\\to S^{2}\\setminus\\{N,S\\}$ explicitly excludes the poles $N$ and $S$ from its range. The coordinate map $F$ is a diffeomorphism from its domain to its range, but it is not defined at the poles. At $\\theta=0$ or $\\theta=\\pi$, the coordinate $\\phi$ becomes ill-defined, and the Jacobian matrix of the transformation from spherical to Cartesian coordinates becomes singular. This is a coordinate singularity. The manifold $S^2$ is itself a complete Riemannian manifold. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, any geodesic on a complete Riemannian manifold can be extended indefinitely. The inability to represent the curve for $t \\leq 0$ or $t \\geq \\pi$ within this specific chart is a limitation of the chart, not an intrinsic barrier to the geodesic's existence on the manifold. The geodesic itself continues smoothly through the poles.\n\nThird, we construct the smooth unit-speed extension $\\gamma:\\mathbb{R}\\to S^{2}$.\nThe expression for the curve in the ambient space is $c(t) = \\big(\\sin(t),\\ 0,\\ \\cos(t)\\big)$ for $t \\in (0,\\pi)$. This expression is well-defined and analytic for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We can therefore define the extended curve $\\gamma:\\mathbb{R}\\to S^{2}$ by this same formula:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\big(\\sin(t),\\ 0,\\ \\cos(t)\\big)\n$$\nWe verify that this curve satisfies the required properties:\n1.  **Smoothness:** The component functions $\\sin(t)$, $0$, and $\\cos(t)$ are infinitely differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\\gamma(t)$ is a smooth curve.\n2.  **Lies on $S^2$:** For any $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the norm is $\\|\\gamma(t)\\| = \\sqrt{(\\sin(t))^2 + 0^2 + (\\cos(t))^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. The curve lies on the unit sphere for all $t$.\n3.  **Unit-speed:** The velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\big(\\cos(t),\\ 0,\\ -\\sin(t)\\big)$. Its magnitude is $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\| = \\sqrt{(\\cos(t))^2 + 0^2 + (-\\sin(t))^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. The curve is parameterized by arc length. The parameter $t$ is indeed the angle in radians as stated.\n4.  **Extension of $c$:** For $t \\in (0,\\pi)$, the expression for $\\gamma(t)$ is identical to that of $c(t)$.\n\nThe curve $\\gamma(t)$ is a smooth, unit-speed, periodic curve with period $2\\pi$ that continuously traces and retraces the great circle in the $xz$-plane. It passes through the north pole $N=(0,0,1)$ at $t=2k\\pi$ and the south pole $S=(0,0,-1)$ at $t=(2k+1)\\pi$ for any integer $k$.

The problem asks for a demonstration that the geodesic is radial, the calculation of the maximal time interval on which the geodesic is defined within $M$, and an explanation of the resulting geodesic incompleteness.\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all terms are formally defined within the context of Riemannian geometry. The setup is self-contained and consistent. No flaws are identified. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the problem. A geodesic is a curve $\\gamma(t)$ that is a stationary point of the energy functional $E(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int g(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t)) dt$. The Euler-Lagrange equations derived from this functional describe the geodesics. The Lagrangian $L$ for a curve $\\gamma(t) = (r(t), \\theta(t))$ in the given metric is:\n$$L(r, \\theta, \\dot{r}, \\dot{\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\alpha}(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ r^{2\\alpha} \\dot{r}^{2} + r^{2\\alpha} r^{2} \\dot{\\theta}^{2} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ r^{2\\alpha} \\dot{r}^{2} + r^{2\\alpha+2} \\dot{\\theta}^{2} \\right]$$\nwhere $\\dot{r} = \\frac{dr}{dt}$ and $\\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$.\n\nThe geodesic equations are the Euler-Lagrange equations:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{i}}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q^{i}} = 0 $$\nfor coordinates $q^i \\in \\{r, \\theta\\}$.\n\nFor the coordinate $\\theta$, the Lagrangian $L$ does not depend explicitly on $\\theta$, so $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$. This implies a conservation law:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = \\text{constant} $$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $\\dot{\\theta}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = r^{2\\alpha+2} \\dot{\\theta} $$\nThus, there exists a constant $C$ such that $r(t)^{2\\alpha+2} \\dot{\\theta}(t) = C$ for all $t$ along the geodesic.\n\nWe now apply the initial conditions. The geodesic starts at $\\gamma(0) = (r_{0}, \\theta_{0})$. The initial velocity is \"purely radial inward\". In polar coordinates, a radial velocity vector has a zero component in the $\\theta$ direction. Thus, $\\dot{\\theta}(0) = 0$.\nEvaluating the constant $C$ at $t=0$:\n$$ C = r(0)^{2\\alpha+2} \\dot{\\theta}(0) = r_{0}^{2\\alpha+2} \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nSince $C=0$ for all time, we have $r(t)^{2\\alpha+2} \\dot{\\theta}(t) = 0$. The geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is defined on the manifold $M$ where $r(t)  0$. As $\\alpha  0$, the term $r(t)^{2\\alpha+2}$ is non-zero. Therefore, it must be that $\\dot{\\theta}(t) = 0$ for all $t$ for which the geodesic is defined in $M$.\nIntegrating $\\dot{\\theta}(t)=0$ with respect to time gives $\\theta(t) = \\theta(0) = \\theta_{0}$. This proves that the geodesic is a radial line, $\\gamma(t) = (r(t), \\theta_{0})$.\n\nNext, we analyze the dynamics of $r(t)$. We are given that the geodesic is parameterized by arc-length (unit speed). This means the magnitude of the velocity vector is constant and equal to $1$:\n$$ ||\\dot{\\gamma}(t)||_{g_{\\alpha}}^{2} = g_{\\alpha}(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t)) = 1 $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the metric and using $\\dot{\\theta}(t)=0$:\n$$ r(t)^{2\\alpha} \\dot{r}(t)^{2} + r(t)^{2\\alpha+2} \\dot{\\theta}(t)^{2} = r(t)^{2\\alpha} \\dot{r}(t)^{2} = 1 $$\nThis implies $\\dot{r}(t)^{2} = r(t)^{-2\\alpha}$, which yields $\\dot{r}(t) = \\pm r(t)^{-\\alpha}$.\nThe initial velocity is inward, which means $\\dot{r}(0)$ must be negative. Therefore, we must choose the negative root:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = -r^{-\\alpha} $$\nThis is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation. We can solve for the time $T(\\alpha, r_0)$ it takes for the particle to travel from its initial position $r(0)=r_0$ to the puncture at $r=0$. We separate variables and integrate:\n$$ r^{\\alpha} dr = -dt $$\nWe integrate from the initial state $(t=0, r=r_0)$ to the final state $(t=T, r=0)$:\n$$ \\int_{r_{0}}^{0} u^{\\alpha} \\,du = \\int_{0}^{T(\\alpha, r_{0})} -1 \\,dt $$\nThe integral on the right side is simply $-T(\\alpha, r_{0})$. For the left side, since $\\alpha  0$, we have $\\alpha+1  1$, and the antiderivative of $u^{\\alpha}$ is $\\frac{u^{\\alpha+1}}{\\alpha+1}$.\n$$ \\left[ \\frac{u^{\\alpha+1}}{\\alpha+1} \\right]_{r_{0}}^{0} = \\frac{0^{\\alpha+1}}{\\alpha+1} - \\frac{r_{0}^{\\alpha+1}}{\\alpha+1} = -\\frac{r_{0}^{\\alpha+1}}{\\alpha+1} $$\nEquating the two results:\n$$ -\\frac{r_{0}^{\\alpha+1}}{\\alpha+1} = -T(\\alpha, r_{0}) $$\nThus, the time to reach the puncture is:\n$$ T(\\alpha, r_{0}) = \\frac{r_{0}^{\\alpha+1}}{\\alpha+1} $$\nThis is the maximal parameter value for which the geodesic is defined on the interval $[0, T(\\alpha, r_{0}))$.
