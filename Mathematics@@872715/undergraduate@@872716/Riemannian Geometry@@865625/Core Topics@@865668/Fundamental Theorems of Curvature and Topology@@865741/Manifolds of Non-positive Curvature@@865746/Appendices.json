Therefore, its derivative $\\dot{y}(t)$ must be non-negative, so we can write $|\\dot{y}(t)| = \\dot{y}(t)$. The norm simplifies to:\n$$\n\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g} = \\frac{\\dot{y}(t)}{y(t)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression into the integral for the length of the curve:\n$$\nL(\\gamma) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\dot{y}(t)}{y(t)} \\, dt\n$$\nThis integral can be solved using a change of variables. Let $u = y(t)$, which implies $du = \\dot{y}(t) \\, dt$. The limits of integration for the new variable $u$ are determined by the boundary conditions: when $t=0$, $u = y(0) = a$; when $t=1$, $u = y(1) = b$. The integral becomes:\n$$\nL(\\gamma) = \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du\n$$\nThis is a standard elementary integral:\n$$\nL(\\gamma) = [\\ln|u|]_{a}^{b} = \\ln|b| - \\ln|a|\n$$\nSince the domain is $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$, we have $y  0$, so $a$ and $b$ are positive.

The length of the curve is:\n$$\nL(\\gamma) = \\ln(b) - \\ln(a) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)\n$$\nThis result is independent of the specific parametrization $y(t)$, as expected for the length of a curve. It is the hyperbolic distance between the points $(x_0, a)$ and $(x_0, b)$.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must interpret this result in the context of the general upper half-space model $\\mathbb{H}^{n}$ with metric $g = x_{n}^{-2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} dx_{i}^{2}$. The length element $ds$ is given by $ds^{2} = g_{ij}dx^{i}dx^{j}$. In our case, for a purely vertical displacement (where only $dx_{n} \\neq 0$), the infinitesimal length is:\n$$\nds = \\sqrt{x_{n}^{-2} (dx_{n})^{2}} = \\frac{|dx_{n}|}{x_{n}}\n$$\nThe length computed above, $\\ln(b/a)$, is the integral of this length element from $x_{n}=a$ to $x_{n}=b$. The crucial element is the conformal scaling factor $x_{n}^{-1}$ applied to Euclidean displacements $dx_{n}$ to obtain hyperbolic lengths.\n\nThis scaling factor $x_{n}^{-1}$ dictates how distances behave.\n1.  As one moves toward larger values of $x_{n}$ (i.e., further away from the boundary plane $x_{n}=0$), the scaling factor $x_{n}^{-1}$ approaches $0$. This means that a fixed Euclidean distance, say $\\Delta x_{n} = 1$, corresponds to an increasingly smaller hyperbolic distance. For example, the hyperbolic distance from $x_{n}=100$ to $x_{n}=101$ is $\\ln(101/100) \\approx 0.01$, while the distance from $x_{n}=1000$ to $x_{n}=1001$ is $\\ln(1001/1000) \\approx 0.001$. The space is \"compressed\" at large values of $x_{n}$.\n\n2.  As one approaches the boundary $x_{n} \\to 0^{+}$, the scaling factor $x_{n}^{-1}$ tends to infinity. This implies that even infinitesimal Euclidean displacements near the boundary correspond to very large hyperbolic distances. The integral of $dx_{n}/x_{n}$ from any point $b0$ down to $a \\to 0^{+}$ is $\\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{1}{x_{n}}dx_{n} = \\ln(b/a)$, which diverges to $+\\infty$. This signifies that the boundary plane $x_{n}=0$ is infinitely far away from any point in the interior of $\\mathbb{H}^{n}$.\n\nIn summary, the conformal factor $x_{n}^{-2}$ in the metric causes intrinsic distances to shrink relative to Euclidean distances as one moves deeper into the space (large $x_{n}$) and to expand dramatically as one approaches the boundary (small $x_{n}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3057317"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how distance is warped in a negatively curved space, we now explore a more profound consequence: how volume itself behaves.
