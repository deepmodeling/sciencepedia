It is a standard exercise in differential geometry that can be solved using established principles. Therefore, a full solution is provided.\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for an explicit upper bound on the diameter of a complete $2$-sphere, denoted $\\left(S^{2},g\\right)$, whose Gaussian curvature $K$ satisfies $K \\geq 4$ everywhere. We are instructed to use the relationship between Gaussian curvature and Ricci curvature in dimension $2$, and the Bonnet-Myers theorem.\n\nFor a $2$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Ricci curvature tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$, is directly proportional to the Gaussian curvature $K$ and the metric tensor $g$. The relationship is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric} = K g $$\nThis equality means that for any point $p \\in S^2$ and any tangent vector $v \\in T_p S^2$, the value of the Ricci tensor acting on $v$ is $\\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) = K(p) g(v, v)$.\n\nThe problem provides the condition that $K \\geq 4$ at all points on the sphere. Let $v$ be a unit tangent vector, meaning $g(v, v) = 1$. Then, the Ricci curvature in the direction of $v$ satisfies:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) = K g(v, v) = K \\cdot 1 = K \\geq 4 $$\nThis establishes a lower bound for the Ricci curvature of the manifold.\n\nThe problem refers to the \"standard global consequence for the diameter of a complete manifold with strictly positive lower Ricci curvature bound,\" which is the Bonnet-Myers theorem. The theorem states that if $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ is a complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature satisfying $\\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) \\geq (n-1)k > 0$ for all unit tangent vectors $v$ and for some constant $k > 0$, then the manifold is compact and its diameter is bounded by:\n$$ \\mathrm{diam}(M) \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}} $$\nIn our case, the manifold is $\\left(S^{2},g\\right)$, so the dimension is $n=2$. The Ricci curvature condition from the theorem becomes $\\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) \\geq (2-1)k = k$.\nWe derived from the problem's givens that $\\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) \\geq 4$. By comparing this with the theorem's requirement, $\\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) \\geq k$, we can identify the constant $k$ as $k=4$. Since $k=4>0$, all conditions of the Bonnet-Myers theorem are satisfied.\n\nApplying the theorem, we obtain the upper bound for the diameter of $\\left(S^{2},g\\right)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{diam}\\left(S^{2}, g\\right) \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{4}} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nThis is the explicit upper bound for the diameter.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks us to consider a specific case: the round sphere of radius $r=\\frac{1}{2}$ with its standard metric.\nFor a standard sphere of radius $r$ in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the Gaussian curvature $K$ is constant everywhere and is given by the formula $K = \\frac{1}{r^2}$.\nFor $r = \\frac{1}{2}$, the Gaussian curvature is:\n$$ K = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 4 $$\nThis sphere is a complete manifold, and its curvature $K=4$ satisfies the given condition $K \\geq 4$.\n\nNext, we compute the actual diameter of this sphere. The diameter of a sphere of radius $r$ is the greatest distance between any two of its points. This maximum distance is achieved between any pair of antipodal points. The shortest path between antipodal points is along a great circle. The length of a great circle (the circumference) is $2\\pi r$. The distance between antipodal points is half of this length. Thus, the diameter is:\n$$ \\mathrm{diam}_{\\text{actual}} = \\pi r $$\nFor the sphere with radius $r=\\frac{1}{2}$, the actual diameter is:\n$$ \\mathrm{diam}_{\\text{actual}} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nWe observe that for this specific sphere, the actual diameter is equal to the upper bound derived from the Bonnet-Myers theorem. This is a known feature of the theorem; the equality holds for spheres with their standard metrics, which are \"maximally symmetric\" spaces that realize the curvature bound.\n\nFinally, we are asked to report the ratio of the upper bound to the actual diameter for this specific case.\nThe upper bound is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nThe actual diameter is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nThe ratio is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Upper Bound}}{\\text{Actual Diameter}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} = 1 $$\nThe final answer is the single exact real number $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3068405"}, {"introduction": "Having seen a case where the Bonnet-Myers bound is sharp, we now explore a more subtle example: the real projective space $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$.

The solution will follow the three suggested steps.\n\nFirst, we justify that the Ricci curvature of $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n}, g)$ is $\\operatorname{Ric}=(n-1)g$.\nThe unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$ is given to have constant sectional curvature $K_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}} = 1$. The dimension of $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$ is $n$. According to the provided fact (ii), a manifold of dimension $m$ and constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$ has a Ricci tensor given by $\\operatorname{Ric} = (m-1)\\kappa g$. Applying this to $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$ with $m=n$ and $\\kappa=1$, we find its Ricci tensor is $\\operatorname{Ric}_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}} = (n-1)(1)g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}} = (n-1)g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}$.\nThe problem states that the metric $g$ on $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is the unique metric for which the quotient map $\\pi: \\mathbb{S}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is a local isometry. The map $\\pi$ is a Riemannian covering. As stated in fact (i), a Riemannian covering is a local isometry and preserves local curvature properties. Specifically, the sectional curvature at a point in $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ for any $2$-plane in its tangent space is identical to the sectional curvature at a corresponding point in $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$ for the corresponding $2$-plane. Since $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$ has constant sectional curvature $1$, the space $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n}, g)$ must also have constant sectional curvature $\\kappa_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}} = 1$.\nThe dimension of $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is also $n$. Applying fact (ii) to $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n}, g)$, its Ricci tensor is $\\operatorname{Ric}_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}} = (n-1)\\kappa_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}} g = (n-1)(1)g = (n-1)g$.\n\nSecond, we determine an upper bound for the diameter using the Bonnet-Myers theorem.\nThe Bonnet-Myers theorem states that a complete, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ whose Ricci curvature satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric}(X,X) \\ge (n-1)k g(X,X)$ for some constant $k>0$ and all tangent vectors $X$ must be compact and have a diameter bounded above by $\\operatorname{diam}(M) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$.\nThe real projective space $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is the continuous image of the compact space $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$, so it is compact. A compact Riemannian manifold is complete. From our first step, we have $\\operatorname{Ric}_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}} = (n-1)g$. This corresponds to the inequality $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)k g$ with the choice of $k=1$. This is the largest possible value for $k$ that satisfies the inequality, which will yield the tightest upper bound. Applying the Bonnet-Myers theorem with $k=1$, we conclude that the diameter of $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is bounded by:\n$$\n\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{RP}^{n}, g) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{1}} = \\pi.\n$$\n\nThird, we compute the exact diameter of $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n},g)$.\nThe diameter of a metric space is the supremum of the distance function over all pairs of points. For $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$, this is $\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{RP}^{n}) = \\sup_{[x],[y] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^{n}} d_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}([x],[y])$.\nThe points of $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ are equivalence classes $[x] = \\{x, -x\\}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{S}^{n}$.\nUsing the given fact (iv), the distance on $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is defined as $d_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}([x],[y]) = \\min\\{d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,y), d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,-y)\\}$.\nThe geodesic distance on the unit sphere, from fact (iii), is $d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,y) = \\arccos(\\langle x,y\\rangle)$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the dot product in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. This distance, let's call it $\\theta$, is the angle between the vectors $x$ and $y$ and lies in the range $[0, \\pi]$.\nThe distance $d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,-y)$ is the angle between $x$ and $-y$. Geometrically, the great circle passing through $x$ and $y$ also passes through their antipodes. The sum of the two arc lengths between $x$ and $y$ along this great circle is the circumference of the circle, which is $2\\pi$ for a unit sphere. The geodesic distance is the shorter arc. The longer arc between $x$ and $y$ is the shorter arc between $x$ and $-y$ (assuming $y$ and $-y$ are distinct). The sum of the geodesic distances $d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,y)$ and $d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,-y)$ is the distance from $x$ to $-x$ along the great circle, which is $\\pi$. Thus, $d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,y) + d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,-y) = \\pi$.\nLet $\\theta = d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,y)$. Then $d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,-y) = \\pi-\\theta$. The distance on $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is $d_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}([x],[y]) = \\min\\{\\theta, \\pi-\\theta\\}$.\nWe want to find the maximum value of the function $f(\\theta) = \\min\\{\\theta, \\pi-\\theta\\}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$. The function $\\theta$ is increasing and the function $\\pi-\\theta$ is decreasing. The minimum of these two functions is maximized when they are equal:\n$$\n\\theta = \\pi - \\theta \\implies 2\\theta = \\pi \\implies \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}.\n$$\nAt this value, $f(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\min\\{\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. For any $\\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $f(\\theta) = \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. For any $\\theta > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $f(\\theta) = \\pi-\\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nThus, the maximum possible value for the distance on $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This maximum is attained when the spherical distance between representative points $x$ and $y$ is $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This corresponds to $\\langle x,y \\rangle = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$, meaning the vectors are orthogonal. Such pairs of points exist for any $n \\ge 1$.\nTherefore, the exact diameter of $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n}, g)$ is the supremum of these distances, which is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$$", "id": "3068355"}, {"introduction": "Mathematical theorems are defined by their hypotheses, and understanding their limits is as important as knowing their conclusions.

The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Derivation\nLet the manifold be $M = M_1 \\times M_2$, where $M_1 = S^1(r)$ and $M_2 = \\mathbb{R}$. The metric on $M$ is the product metric $g = g_1 \\oplus g_2$.\n\n**1. Intrinsic Geometry of the Factors**\n- $M_1 = S^1(r)$ is a $1$-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Any $1$-dimensional Riemannian manifold is intrinsically flat. This is because the Riemann curvature tensor requires at least two linearly independent vector fields to be potentially non-zero. Formally, for a manifold of dimension $n=1$, the Riemann curvature tensor $R(X,Y)Z$, the sectional curvature $K(X,Y)$, and the Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}(X,Y)$ are all identically zero. Thus, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M_1} \\equiv 0$.\n- $M_2 = \\mathbb{R}$ with its standard metric is also a $1$-dimensional, and hence flat, Riemannian manifold. Thus, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M_2} \\equiv 0$.\n- In local coordinates, let $\\theta$ be the angle for $S^1(r)$ and $t$ be the coordinate for $\\mathbb{R}$. The metric on $M_1$ is $g_1 = r^2 d\\theta^2$, and the metric on $M_2$ is $g_2 = dt^2$. The product metric is $g = r^2 d\\theta^2 + dt^2$. This is the metric of a flat cylinder, which is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n**2. Ricci Curvature of the Product Manifold**\nFor a Riemannian product $M = M_1 \\times M_2$, the Ricci curvature tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}_M$ at a point $(p_1, p_2)$ is related to the Ricci curvatures of the factors by the formula:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}_M(X, Y) = \\operatorname{Ric}_{M_1}(X_1, Y_1) + \\operatorname{Ric}_{M_2}(X_2, Y_2) $$\nwhere $X = X_1 + X_2$ and $Y = Y_1 + Y_2$ are the decompositions of tangent vectors $X, Y \\in T_{(p_1, p_2)}M$ into their components in $T_{p_1}M_1$ and $T_{p_2}M_2$.\nSince $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M_1} \\equiv 0$ and $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M_2} \\equiv 0$, it follows immediately that for any $X, Y$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}_M(X, Y) = 0 + 0 = 0 $$\nTherefore, the Ricci curvature of $M = S^1(r) \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is identically zero, i.e., $\\operatorname{Ric}_M \\equiv 0$.\n\n**3. Diameter of the Product Manifold**\nThe diameter of a Riemannian manifold $(N, g_N)$ is defined as $\\operatorname{diam}(N) = \\sup_{p, q \\in N} d_N(p, q)$, where $d_N$ is the geodesic distance.\nFor a Riemannian product $M = M_1 \\times M_2$, the geodesic distance between two points $p = (p_1, p_2)$ and $q = (q_1, q_2)$ is given by the Pythagorean-like formula:\n$$ d_M(p, q)^2 = d_{M_1}(p_1, q_1)^2 + d_{M_2}(p_2, q_2)^2 $$\n- The diameter of $M_1 = S^1(r)$ is the maximum distance between any two points, which occurs for antipodal points. This distance is half the circumference: $\\operatorname{diam}(S^1(r)) = \\pi r$. This is a finite value.\n- The diameter of $M_2 = \\mathbb{R}$ is infinite, as the distance $|t_1 - t_2|$ between two points $t_1, t_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is unbounded. $\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{R}) = \\infty$.\nTo find the diameter of $M$, we must take the supremum over all pairs of points. Let's fix a point $p_1 \\in S^1(r)$ and consider the line $\\{p_1\\} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\subset M$. For any two points $p=(p_1, t_1)$ and $q=(p_1, t_2)$ on this line, the distance is:\n$$ d_M(p,q) = \\sqrt{d_{S^1}(p_1, p_1)^2 + d_{\\mathbb{R}}(t_1, t_2)^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + (t_2 - t_1)^2} = |t_2 - t_1| $$\nSince $|t_2 - t_1|$ can be arbitrarily large, the distances between points in $M$ are unbounded. Therefore, the diameter of $M$ is infinite: $\\operatorname{diam}(M) = \\infty$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The Ricci curvature of $M$ is everywhere nonnegative, and in fact $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$.**\nAs derived above, the manifold $M$ is a product of two flat $1$-dimensional manifolds. The Ricci curvature of a product is the sum of the Ricci curvatures of the factors. Since both factors have zero Ricci curvature, the Ricci curvature of $M$ is identically zero. A function that is identically zero is, by definition, nonnegative. This statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The diameter of $M$ is infinite, i.e., $\\operatorname{diam}(M)=\\infty$.**\nAs derived above, the presence of the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor, which has infinite diameter, makes the diameter of the product manifold $S^1(r) \\times \\mathbb{R}$ infinite. We can find a pair of points in $M$ with arbitrarily large geodesic distance between them by moving along the $\\mathbb{R}$ direction.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The Bonnet–Myers theorem gives the upper bound $\\operatorname{diam}(M)\\le \\pi r$.**\nThe Bonnet–Myers theorem states that for a complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold where the Ricci curvature satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric}(v, v) \\ge (n-1)k$ for all unit tangent vectors $v$ and for some constant $k > 0$, the manifold must be compact and its diameter must satisfy $\\operatorname{diam}(M) \\le \\pi/\\sqrt{k}$.\nFor our manifold $M$, the dimension is $n=2$ and the Ricci curvature is $\\operatorname{Ric}_M \\equiv 0$. The condition for the theorem requires a strictly positive lower bound on the Ricci curvature ($k>0$). Since the Ricci curvature is $0$, this condition is not met for any $k>0$. Therefore, the Bonnet–Myers theorem is not applicable to $M$ and cannot be used to deduce any bound on its diameter. The statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because $S^1(r)$ has positive curvature $1/r^2$ when viewed as a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the Ricci curvature of $M$ is positive in directions tangent to the $S^1(r)$ factor.**\nThis statement conflates extrinsic curvature with intrinsic curvature. The curvature of $S^1(r)$ as a curve embedded in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is an extrinsic property. The problem explicitly requires the use of *intrinsic* Riemannian geometry. Intrinsically, $S^1(r)$ is a $1$-dimensional manifold, and all $1$-dimensional manifolds are flat (i.e., their intrinsic Riemann and Ricci curvature tensors are identically zero). As shown in the derivation, the Ricci curvature of the product manifold $M$ is zero in all directions, including those tangent to the $S^1(r)$ factor.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For sufficiently small $r>0$, the diameter of $M$ becomes finite.**\nAs shown in the analysis for option B, the diameter of $M$ is infinite. The distance formula $d_M(p, q)^2 = d_{S^1}(p_1, q_1)^2 + d_{\\mathbb{R}}(p_2, q_2)^2$ shows that while the first term depends on $r$ (the maximum value of $d_{S^1}$ is $\\pi r$), the second term $d_{\\mathbb{R}}(p_2, q_2)^2$ is unbounded regardless of the value of $r$. Therefore, the diameter of $M$ is infinite for any choice of $r > 0$. Making $r$ small does not change the non-compactness of the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor, which is the cause of the infinite diameter.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "3034313"}]}
