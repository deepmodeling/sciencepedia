It is free from any scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\nThe task is to determine the determinant of the parallel transport map $P_{2\\pi}$ around a great circle on the $n$-sphere $S^n$. We begin by formalizing the condition for parallel transport.\n\nLet $S^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be the unit $n$-sphere. The Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ on $S^n$ is related to the standard Euclidean connection (flat connection) $D$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ by the Gauss formula. For a vector field $Y$ tangent to $S^n$ along a curve $\\gamma(t) \\subset S^n$, its covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ is the orthogonal projection of its Euclidean derivative onto the tangent space of the sphere. That is,\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)} Y(t) = (D_{\\gamma'(t)} Y(t))^{\\top}\n$$\nIn Euclidean space, $D_{\\gamma'(t)} Y(t)$ is simply the ordinary derivative with respect to $t$, which we denote by $Y'(t)$. The projection of a vector $Z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ onto the tangent space $T_q S^n = q^{\\perp}$ at a point $q \\in S^n$ is given by $Z^{\\top} = Z - \\langle Z, q \\rangle q$.\n\nA vector field $X(t)$ along $\\gamma(t)$ is parallel if its covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ is zero: $\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)} X(t) = 0$. Using the characterization above, this means that its Euclidean derivative $X'(t)$ must be orthogonal to the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(t)}S^n$. The normal space to $S^n$ at $\\gamma(t)$ is the one-dimensional space spanned by the position vector $\\gamma(t)$. Therefore, the condition for parallel transport is that $X'(t)$ must be collinear with $\\gamma(t)$:\n$$\nX'(t) = \\lambda(t) \\gamma(t)\n$$\nfor some scalar function $\\lambda(t)$.\n\nSince $X(t)$ is a tangent vector field along $\\gamma(t)$, it must be orthogonal to the position vector $\\gamma(t)$ for all $t$:\n$$\n\\langle X(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle = 0\n$$\nDifferentiating this orthogonality condition with respect to $t$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle X(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle = \\langle X'(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle + \\langle X(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $X'(t) = \\lambda(t) \\gamma(t)$ into this equation, we get:\n$$\n\\langle \\lambda(t) \\gamma(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle + \\langle X(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle = 0\n$$\nSince $\\gamma(t)$ is on the unit sphere, $\\langle \\gamma(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle = 1$. This simplifies to:\n$$\n\\lambda(t) + \\langle X(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle = 0 \\implies \\lambda(t) = -\\langle X(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle\n$$\nThus, a vector field $X(t)$ is parallel along $\\gamma(t)$ if and only if it satisfies the differential equation:\n$$\nX'(t) = -\\langle X(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle \\gamma(t)\n$$\nThe parallel transport map $P_t: T_p S^n \\to T_{\\gamma(t)} S^n$ is defined by $P_t(x) = X(t)$, where $X(t)$ is the solution to this ODE with the initial condition $X(0) = x$.\n\nWe are given the great circle $\\gamma(t) = \\cos(t)u + \\sin(t)v$, where $u,v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ are orthonormal. The starting point is $p = \\gamma(0) = u$. The tangent space at $p$ is $T_p S^n = u^\\perp$. The velocity vector of the curve is $\\gamma'(t) = -\\sin(t)u + \\cos(t)v$.\n\nTo find the map $P_t$, we find its action on a basis of $T_p S^n$. Let $W = (\\text{span}\\{u,v\\})^\\perp$ be the $(n-1)$-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ orthogonal to both $u$ and $v$. Let $\\{w_1, \\dots, w_{n-1}\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $W$.

Let's test the constant vector field $X(t) = w_k$.\n$X'(t) = 0$.\nThe right-hand side of the transport equation is $-\\langle w_k, \\gamma'(t) \\rangle \\gamma(t) = -0 \\cdot \\gamma(t) = 0$.\nThus, $X(t) = w_k$ is the parallel transport of $w_k$.\n$$\nP_t(w_k) = w_k\n$$\n\nCase 2: The initial vector is $x = v$.\nWe need to solve $X'(t) = -\\langle X(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle \\gamma(t)$ with $X(0) = v$.\nThe entire evolution occurs within the 2-plane spanned by $u$ and $v$. Let's try a solution of the form $X(t) = a(t)u + b(t)v$. The tangency condition $\\langle X(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle = 0$ gives $\\langle a(t)u+b(t)v, \\cos(t)u+\\sin(t)v \\rangle = a(t)\\cos(t) + b(t)\\sin(t) = 0$. This suggests a solution of the form $X(t) = C(-\\sin(t)u + \\cos(t)v)$ for some constant $C$.\nThis is $X(t) = C \\gamma'(t)$. Let's verify if this solves the ODE.\n$X'(t) = C \\gamma''(t) = C(-\\cos(t)u - \\sin(t)v) = -C\\gamma(t)$.\nThe right-hand side is $-\\langle C\\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle \\gamma(t) = -C|\\gamma'(t)|^2 \\gamma(t) = -C\\gamma(t)$, since $|\\gamma'(t)|^2 = \\sin^2(t)+\\cos^2(t) = 1$.\nThe equation is satisfied. We determine $C$ from the initial condition $X(0) = v$.\n$X(0) = C\\gamma'(0) = C(-\\sin(0)u + \\cos(0)v) = C v$.\nSo, $C v = v$, which implies $C=1$.\nTherefore, the parallel transport of $v$ is $X(t) = \\gamma'(t) = -\\sin(t)u + \\cos(t)v$.\n$$\nP_t(v) = -\\sin(t)u + \\cos(t)v\n$$\nAn arbitrary vector $x \\in T_pS^n$ can be decomposed as $x = \\langle x,v \\rangle v + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\langle x,w_k \\rangle w_k$. By linearity of parallel transport:\n$$\nP_t(x) = \\langle x,v \\rangle P_t(v) + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\langle x,w_k \\rangle P_t(w_k) = \\langle x,v \\rangle(-\\sin(t)u + \\cos(t)v) + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\langle x,w_k \\rangle w_k\n$$\nThis is the explicit formula for $P_t(x)$.\n\nWe now compute the endomorphism $P_{2\\pi}: T_p S^n \\to T_p S^n$. Note that $\\gamma(2\\pi) = u = p$, so the map is indeed an endomorphism. We evaluate at $t=2\\pi$:\nFor the basis vectors $\\{w_k\\}$:\n$$\nP_{2\\pi}(w_k) = w_k\n$$\nFor the basis vector $v$:\n$$\nP_{2\\pi}(v) = -\\sin(2\\pi)u + \\cos(2\\pi)v = -0 \\cdot u + 1 \\cdot v = v\n$$\nThe map $P_{2\\pi}$ fixes every vector in the basis $\\{v, w_1, \\dots, w_{n-1}\\}$ of $T_p S^n$. Therefore, $P_{2\\pi}$ is the identity map on $T_p S^n$:\n$$\nP_{2\\pi} = \\mathrm{Id}_{T_p S^n}\n$$\nThe matrix representation of the identity map in any basis is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix $I_n$.\nThe determinant is therefore:\n$$\n\\det(P_{2\\pi}) = \\det(I_n) = 1\n$$\nThis result, being positive, verifies that parallel transport along this great circle preserves orientation, which is expected for any closed loop on the orientable manifold $S^n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3067176"}, {"introduction": "The proof of Synge's theorem is a beautiful application of the calculus of variations, hinging on the idea that in a positively curved space, a non-contractible loop cannot be a stable length-minimizer.
