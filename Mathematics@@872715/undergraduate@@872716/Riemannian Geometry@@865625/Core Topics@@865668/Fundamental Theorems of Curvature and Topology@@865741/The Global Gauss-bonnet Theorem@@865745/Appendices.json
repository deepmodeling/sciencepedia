The construction of the surface from a square provides a natural cell decomposition. The Euler characteristic for a 2D surface is given by the formula $\\chi = V - E + F$, where $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges, and $F$ is the number of faces in the cell decomposition.\n\n1.  **Faces (F):** The interior of the original square becomes the single 2-dimensional cell, or face, of our surface. Thus, $F = 1$.\n\n2.  **Edges (E):** The original square has four edges. The identification rule connects the top edge to the bottom edge, so they become a single edge in the final topology. Similarly, the left edge is identified with the right edge, becoming a second, distinct edge. Therefore, the total number of unique edges on the surface is $E = 2$.\n\n3.  **Vertices (V):** The original square has four corners (vertices). The identification rule means the top-left corner is identified with the bottom-left corner (top/bottom identification) and also with the top-right corner (left/right identification). Following this logic, all four corners of the square (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) are mapped to a single point on the final surface. Thus, there is only one unique vertex in the cell decomposition, so $V = 1$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Euler characteristic using the formula $\\chi = V - E + F$:\n$$\n\\chi = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0\n$$\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the torus is 0.\n\nNext, we calculate the total integral of the Gaussian curvature, $I = \\int K dA$. To do this, we employ the global Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For a compact, orientable surface $S$ without a boundary, the theorem states:\n$$\n\\int_S K dA = 2\\pi \\chi(S)\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the Gaussian curvature and $\\chi(S)$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface $S$.\n\nThe surface described is a torus, which is a compact, orientable surface without boundary.

The original surface was a flat square, where the Gaussian curvature $K$ is zero everywhere. The process of identifying edges to form the torus can be done without any stretching or local distortion of the metric (i.e., the surface remains \"flat\" everywhere), so its Gaussian curvature remains $K=0$ at every point.

A direct calculation of the Gaussian curvature $K$ and its integral would be exceedingly complex. However, the problem can be solved by analyzing the topology of the surfaces and applying the global Gauss-Bonnet theorem.\n\nThe Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a compact, orientable surface $S$ without a boundary states that the integral of its Gaussian curvature $K$ over the surface is directly proportional to its Euler characteristic $\\chi(S)$:\n$$ \\int_S K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\chi(S) $$\nThe Euler characteristic is a topological invariant. For a surface of genus $g$, it is given by $\\chi = 2 - 2g$.\n\nOur strategy will be to determine the topology, and thus the Euler characteristic, of the surface $S_\\epsilon$ for small positive $\\epsilon$ and small negative $\\epsilon$. The limits of the total curvature can then be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.\n\nLet's analyze the topology of $S_\\epsilon$ by rewriting the equation in terms of cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$, where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$. The surface equation becomes:\n$$ r^2 = \\epsilon - (z^4 - z^2) $$\nSince $r^2 \\ge 0$, the surface exists only for values of $z$ that satisfy $\\epsilon - (z^4 - z^2) \\ge 0$, or equivalently, $z^4 - z^2 \\le \\epsilon$.\n\n**Case 1: The limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0^-$ (approaching zero from the negative side)**\n\nLet's consider a small negative value of $\\epsilon$, such as $\\epsilon \\in (-1/4, 0)$. The condition for the surface to exist is $z^4 - z^2 \\le \\epsilon < 0$.\nLet's analyze the function $f(z) = z^4 - z^2$. Its derivative is $f'(z) = 4z^3 - 2z = 2z(2z^2 - 1)$. The critical points are $z=0$ and $z=\\pm 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n- At $z=0$, $f(0) = 0$, which is a local maximum.\n- At $z = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{2}$, $f(\\pm 1/\\sqrt{2}) = (1/4) - (1/2) = -1/4$, which are global minima.\n\nSince $\\epsilon < 0$, the condition $z^4 - z^2 \\le \\epsilon$ cannot be satisfied for $z$ near $0$, because $f(z)$ is non-positive and maximized at $z=0$. However, since the minimum value of $f(z)$ is $-1/4$, and we chose $\\epsilon \\in (-1/4, 0)$, there are values of $z$ for which $f(z) \\le \\epsilon$. These values lie in two disjoint intervals, one surrounding $z = -1/\\sqrt{2}$ and the other surrounding $z = +1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThis means the surface $S_\\epsilon$ is composed of two completely separate, disconnected components. Each component is a surface of revolution generated by a profile curve $r(z) = \\sqrt{\\epsilon - (z^4 - z^2)}$ over a closed interval of $z$. Since the profile curve starts and ends at $r=0$, revolving it creates a closed surface. Each of these smooth, closed, and connected surfaces is topologically equivalent to a sphere, $S^2$.\nThus, for $-1/4 < \\epsilon < 0$, the surface is a disjoint union of two spheres: $S_\\epsilon = S^2 \\sqcup S^2$.\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a disjoint union is the sum of the Euler characteristics of its components. The Euler characteristic of a sphere is $\\chi(S^2) = 2$.\nTherefore, $\\chi(S_\\epsilon) = \\chi(S^2) + \\chi(S^2) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\nUsing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the total curvature for $\\epsilon \\in (-1/4, 0)$ is:\n$$ C(\\epsilon) = \\int_{S_\\epsilon} K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\chi(S_\\epsilon) = 2\\pi(4) = 8\\pi $$\nThis value is constant for all $\\epsilon$ in this interval.

The equation is $r^2 = \\epsilon + z^2 - z^4$.\nThe surface exists for $z$ values satisfying $\\epsilon + z^2 - z^4 \\ge 0$. Let $h(z) = \\epsilon + z^2 - z^4$.\nSince $\\epsilon > 0$, $h(0) = \\epsilon > 0$. At $z=0$, we have $r^2 = \\epsilon$, meaning the surface has a \"waist\" of radius $\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$ and is not pinched at the origin. As $|z| \\to \\infty$, $h(z) \\to -\\infty$, so the range of allowed $z$ values is a single, bounded interval symmetric about $z=0$. This implies the surface $S_\\epsilon$ is connected.\n\nThe profile curve $r(z) = \\sqrt{\\epsilon + z^2 - z^4}$ starts at $r=0$ at some maximum $|z|$ value, increases, and then decreases to a positive local minimum of $r=\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$ at $z=0$. Revolving this profile (for $z>0$ and $z<0$) creates a single, connected, closed surface without holes, shaped like a peanut or a dumbbell. Such a surface is topologically equivalent to a sphere, $S^2$.\n\nTherefore, for $\\epsilon > 0$, the surface $S_\\epsilon$ is topologically a sphere.\nThe Euler characteristic is $\\chi(S_\\epsilon) = \\chi(S^2) = 2$.\n\nUsing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the total curvature for $\\epsilon > 0$ is:\n$$ C(\\epsilon) = \\int_{S_\\epsilon} K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\chi(S_\\epsilon) = 2\\pi(2) = 4\\pi $$\nThis value is constant for all $\\epsilon > 0$ (as long as the surface remains topologically a sphere, which it does). Therefore, the limit from the right is:\n$$ \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} C(\\epsilon) = 4\\pi $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Jump**\n\nThe jump in the total curvature is the difference between the right-hand limit and the left-hand limit:\n$$ \\Delta C = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} C(\\epsilon) - \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^-} C(\\epsilon) $$\n$$ \\Delta C = 4\\pi - 8\\pi = -4\\pi $$\nThe physical transition at $\\epsilon = 0$ corresponds to the two separate spherical components merging at the origin (forming a singular surface with two lobes touching at a point) and then opening up into a single connected surface with a thin neck, which changes the overall topology.
