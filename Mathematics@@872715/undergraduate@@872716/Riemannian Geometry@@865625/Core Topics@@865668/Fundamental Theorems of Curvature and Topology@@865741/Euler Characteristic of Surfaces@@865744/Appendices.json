Let the edges of the octagon be labeled consecutively in counter-clockwise order. The identification procedure is encoded by the symbolic word $aba^{-1}b^{-1}cdc^{-1}d^{-1}$. This notation signifies the following pairings of edges:\n1. The first edge (labeled 'a') is identified with the third edge (labeled '$a^{-1}$'), with their orientations reversed.\n2.

The final answer should be a single number.", "solution": "To find the Euler characteristic of the surface, we can use the formula for a polygonal complex: $\\chi = V - E + F$, where $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges, and $F$ is the number of faces in the resulting topological space after identification.\n\n1.  **Number of Faces (F):**\n    The surface is constructed by gluing the edges of a single polygon (the octagon). This polygon itself becomes the single 2-dimensional cell, or face, of the resulting surface. Therefore, $F = 1$.\n\n2.  **Number of Edges (E):**\n    The octagon initially has 8 edges. The identification word $aba^{-1}b^{-1}cdc^{-1}d^{-1}$ tells us how these edges are paired up. The labels are 'a', 'b', '$a^{-1}$', '$b^{-1}$', 'c', 'd', '$c^{-1}$', '$d^{-1}$'.\n    - The edge 'a' is identified with the edge '$a^{-1}$'.\n    - The edge 'b' is identified with the edge '$b^{-1}$'.\n    - The edge 'c' is identified with the edge '$c^{-1}$'.\n    - The edge 'd' is identified with the edge '$d^{-1}$'.\n    Since the 8 initial edges are identified in pairs, there will be $8 / 2 = 4$ distinct edges in the final surface. So, $E = 4$.\n\n3.  **Number of Vertices (V):**\n    This is the most involved part of the calculation. We need to determine how many distinct vertices remain after the gluing process. Let's label the vertices of the octagon $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_8$ in a counter-clockwise direction. An edge labeled 'x' starting at vertex $v_i$ and ending at $v_{i+1}$ can be denoted as $(v_i, v_{i+1})$. The edge labeled '$x^{-1}$' would then correspond to the path $(v_{i+1}, v_i)$.\n\n    Let's trace the edges and vertices:\n    - Edge 1 ('a') runs from $v_1$ to $v_2$.\n    - Edge 2 ('b') runs from $v_2$ to $v_3$.\n    - Edge 3 ('$a^{-1}$') runs from $v_3$ to $v_4$. So, 'a' corresponds to the path from $v_4$ to $v_3$.\n    - Edge 4 ('$b^{-1}$') runs from $v_4$ to $v_5$. So, 'b' corresponds to the path from $v_5$ to $v_4$.\n    - Edge 5 ('c') runs from $v_5$ to $v_6$.\n    - Edge 6 ('d') runs from $v_6$ to $v_7$.\n    - Edge 7 ('$c^{-1}$') runs from $v_7$ to $v_8$. So, 'c' corresponds to the path from $v_8$ to $v_7$.\n    - Edge 8 ('$d^{-1}$') runs from $v_8$ to $v_1$. So, 'd' corresponds to the path from $v_1$ to $v_8$.\n\n    Now we establish equivalences between vertices based on edge identifications. Let '~' denote \"is identified with\".\n    - Identification of 'a' with '$a^{-1}$': Edge $(v_1, v_2)$ is identified with edge $(v_4, v_3)$. This implies that the start point of the first edge is identified with the start point of the second edge, and the end point with the end point. So, $v_1 \\sim v_4$ and $v_2 \\sim v_3$.\n    - Identification of 'b' with '$b^{-1}$': Edge $(v_2, v_3)$ is identified with edge $(v_5, v_4)$. This implies $v_2 \\sim v_5$ and $v_3 \\sim v_4$.\n    - Identification of 'c' with '$c^{-1}$': Edge $(v_5, v_6)$ is identified with edge $(v_8, v_7)$. This implies $v_5 \\sim v_8$ and $v_6 \\sim v_7$.\n    - Identification of 'd' with '$d^{-1}$': Edge $(v_6, v_7)$ is identified with edge $(v_1, v_8)$. This implies $v_6 \\sim v_1$ and $v_7 \\sim v_8$.\n\n    Let's trace the full equivalence class starting from $v_1$:\n    - $v_1 \\sim v_4$ (from 'a' rule).\n    - $v_4 \\sim v_3$ (from 'b' rule). So, $v_1 \\sim v_4 \\sim v_3$.\n    - $v_3 \\sim v_2$ (from 'a' rule). So, $v_1 \\sim v_4 \\sim v_3 \\sim v_2$.\n    - $v_2 \\sim v_5$ (from 'b' rule). So, $v_1 \\sim v_4 \\sim v_3 \\sim v_2 \\sim v_5$.\n    - $v_5 \\sim v_8$ (from 'c' rule). So, $v_1 \\sim \\dots \\sim v_5 \\sim v_8$.\n    - $v_8 \\sim v_7$ (from 'd' rule). So, $v_1 \\sim \\dots \\sim v_8 \\sim v_7$.\n    - $v_7 \\sim v_6$ (from 'c' rule). So, $v_1 \\sim \\dots \\sim v_7 \\sim v_6$.\n    - Finally, the 'd' rule also gives $v_6 \\sim v_1$, which closes the loop.\n\n    The chain of equivalences is $v_1 \\sim v_2 \\sim v_3 \\sim v_4 \\sim v_5 \\sim v_6 \\sim v_7 \\sim v_8$. This shows that all 8 vertices of the octagon are identified to a single point in the quotient space.\n    Therefore, the number of distinct vertices is $V = 1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Euler Characteristic ($\\chi$):**\n    Using the formula $\\chi = V - E + F$ with our computed values:\n    $\\chi = 1 - 4 + 1 = -2$.\n\n    The resulting surface is a connected sum of two tori, also known as a genus-2 surface, which has an Euler characteristic of $2 - 2g = 2 - 2(2) = -2$.
