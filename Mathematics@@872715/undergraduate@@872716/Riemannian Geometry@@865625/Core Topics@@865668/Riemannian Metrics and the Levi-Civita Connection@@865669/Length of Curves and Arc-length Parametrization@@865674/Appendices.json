Work entirely from the foundational definitions of regularity, speed, and arc length for curves in Euclidean $3$-space.

It is scientifically grounded in differential geometry, well-posed with a unique and stable solution, objective, and self-contained. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.

Regularity and Speed**\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $\\gamma(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$. Using the product rule for differentiation:\n$$x'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\exp(t)\\cos(t)) = \\exp(t)\\cos(t) - \\exp(t)\\sin(t) = \\exp(t)(\\cos(t) - \\sin(t))$$\n$$y'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\exp(t)\\sin(t)) = \\exp(t)\\sin(t) + \\exp(t)\\cos(t) = \\exp(t)(\\sin(t) + \\cos(t))$$\n$$z'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\exp(t)) = \\exp(t)$$\nThe tangent vector is $\\gamma'(t) = (x'(t), y'(t), z'(t))$:\n$$\\gamma'(t) = \\big( \\exp(t)(\\cos(t) - \\sin(t)), \\exp(t)(\\sin(t) + \\cos(t)), \\exp(t) \\big)$$\nA curve is defined as regular at a point if its tangent vector is non-zero. To check for regularity on the interval $[0, \\infty)$, we must verify that $\\gamma'(t) \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The third component of the tangent vector is $z'(t) = \\exp(t)$. The exponential function $\\exp(t)$ is strictly positive for all real $t$, so $\\exp(t) > 0$ for $t \\ge 0$. Since at least one component of $\\gamma'(t)$ is never zero, the vector $\\gamma'(t)$ can never be the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} = (0, 0, 0)$. Therefore, the curve $\\gamma$ is regular on its entire domain $[0, \\infty)$.\n\nThe speed of the curve is the magnitude (Euclidean norm) of the tangent vector, denoted $\\lVert\\gamma'(t)\\rVert$. We compute the square of the speed:\n$$\\lVert\\gamma'(t)\\rVert^2 = (x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2$$\n$$\\lVert\\gamma'(t)\\rVert^2 = [\\exp(t)(\\cos(t) - \\sin(t))]^2 + [\\exp(t)(\\sin(t) + \\cos(t))]^2 + [\\exp(t)]^2$$\n$$\\lVert\\gamma'(t)\\rVert^2 = \\exp(2t)(\\cos^2(t) - 2\\cos(t)\\sin(t) + \\sin^2(t)) + \\exp(2t)(\\sin^2(t) + 2\\sin(t)\\cos(t) + \\cos^2(t)) + \\exp(2t)$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) = 1$:\n$$\\lVert\\gamma'(t)\\rVert^2 = \\exp(2t)(1 - 2\\cos(t)\\sin(t)) + \\exp(2t)(1 + 2\\cos(t)\\sin(t)) + \\exp(2t)$$\nFactoring out $\\exp(2t)$:\n$$\\lVert\\gamma'(t)\\rVert^2 = \\exp(2t) \\big( (1 - 2\\cos(t)\\sin(t)) + (1 + 2\\cos(t)\\sin(t)) + 1 \\big)$$\n$$\\lVert\\gamma'(t)\\rVert^2 = \\exp(2t) (1 + 1 + 1) = 3\\exp(2t)$$\nThe speed is the square root of this value. Since $\\exp(t) > 0$, we have:\n$$\\lVert\\gamma'(t)\\rVert = \\sqrt{3\\exp(2t)} = \\sqrt{3}\\exp(t)$$\n\n**2. Arc-Length Function and its Inverse**\n\nThe arc-length parameter $s$ is defined as the integral of the speed from the starting point $t=0$. The condition $s(0)=0$ is satisfied by this definition.\n$$s(t) = \\int_0^t \\lVert\\gamma'(\\tau)\\rVert \\, d\\tau$$\nSubstituting the expression for the speed:\n$$s(t) = \\int_0^t \\sqrt{3}\\exp(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\sqrt{3} \\left[ \\exp(\\tau) \\right]_0^t = \\sqrt{3}(\\exp(t) - \\exp(0))$$\n$$s(t) = \\sqrt{3}(\\exp(t) - 1)$$\nTo prove that $s(t)$ is strictly increasing for $t \\ge 0$, we examine its derivative with respect to $t$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$$\\frac{ds}{dt} = \\lVert\\gamma'(t)\\rVert = \\sqrt{3}\\exp(t)$$\nFor all $t \\in [0, \\infty)$, we have $\\exp(t) \\ge 1$, which implies $\\frac{ds}{dt} = \\sqrt{3}\\exp(t) > 0$. Since the derivative is strictly positive, the function $s(t)$ is strictly increasing on its domain.\n\nNext, we find the inverse function $t(s)$ by solving $s = \\sqrt{3}(\\exp(t) - 1)$ for $t$.\n$$\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\exp(t) - 1$$\n$$\\exp(t) = 1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives $t$ as a function of $s$:\n$$t(s) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$$\nThe domain of this function is determined by the range of $s(t)$. Since $t \\ge 0$, $\\exp(t) \\ge 1$, which means $\\exp(t) - 1 \\ge 0$. Thus, $s = \\sqrt{3}(\\exp(t)-1) \\ge 0$. For $s \\ge 0$, the argument of the logarithm, $1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}$, is always greater than or equal to $1$, so $t(s)$ is well-defined and non-negative.\n\n**3. Arc-Length Reparametrization and Unit-Speed Verification**\n\nThe arc-length reparametrization $\\alpha(s)$ is obtained by composing $\\gamma$ with $t(s)$:\n$$\\alpha(s) = \\gamma(t(s))$$\nWe substitute the expressions for $\\exp(t(s))$ and $t(s)$ into the definition of $\\gamma(t)$:\n$$\\exp(t(s)) = 1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n$$t(s) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$$\nThe components of $\\alpha(s)$ are:\n$$x(s) = \\exp(t(s))\\cos(t(s)) = \\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$y(s) = \\exp(t(s))\\sin(t(s)) = \\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$z(s) = \\exp(t(s)) = 1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nThus, the reparametrized curve is:\n$$\\alpha(s) = \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\right), \\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\right), 1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)$$\n\nTo verify that $\\alpha(s)$ is a unit-speed curve, we must show that $\\lVert\\alpha'(s)\\rVert = 1$. We use the chain rule: $\\alpha'(s) = \\gamma'(t(s)) \\frac{dt}{ds}$.\nThe magnitude is $\\lVert\\alpha'(s)\\rVert = \\lVert\\gamma'(t(s))\\rVert \\left| \\frac{dt}{ds} \\right|$.\nWe have already calculated $\\frac{dt}{ds}$:\n$$\\frac{dt}{ds} = \\frac{d}{ds} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} + s}$$\nSince $s \\ge 0$, $\\frac{dt}{ds} > 0$, so $\\left| \\frac{dt}{ds} \\right| = \\frac{dt}{ds}$.\nThe speed $\\lVert\\gamma'(t)\\rVert$ in terms of $s$ is:\n$$\\lVert\\gamma'(t(s))\\rVert = \\sqrt{3}\\exp(t(s)) = \\sqrt{3}\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\sqrt{3} + s$$\nCombining these results:\n$$\\lVert\\alpha'(s)\\rVert = (\\sqrt{3} + s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} + s} = 1$$\nThe verification is complete.

Formally, $\\gamma'''(t)$ will also have a zero $z$-component, and thus the scalar triple product $(\\gamma' \\times \\gamma'') \\cdot \\gamma'''$ is zero.\nWe examine the limit of the curvature as $t\\to\\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\kappa(t) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}e^t = +\\infty $$\n\n**Extendability Analysis**\nThe curve itself approaches a limit point as $t\\to\\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\gamma(t) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} e^{-t}(\\cos t, \\sin t, 0) = (0,0,0) $$\nThe curve spirals into the origin.\nFor extendability of the unit-speed parametrization, we analyze the unit tangent vector $T(t) = \\frac{\\gamma'(t)}{\\lVert\\gamma'(t)\\rVert}$:\n$$ T(t) = \\frac{e^{-t}(-\\cos t - \\sin t, \\cos t - \\sin t, 0)}{\\sqrt{2}e^{-t}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\cos t - \\sin t, \\cos t - \\sin t, 0) $$\nAs $t\\to\\infty$, the components of $T(t)$ are linear combinations of $\\cos t$ and $\\sin t$, which oscillate and do not converge. Therefore, the limit $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} T(t)$ does not exist.\nThe derivative of the unit-speed curve $\\tilde{\\gamma}(s)$ is the unit tangent vector, $\\tilde{\\gamma}'(s) = T(t(s))$. Since $s\\to L^{-}$ corresponds to $t\\to\\infty$, the limit $\\lim_{s\\to L^{-}}\\tilde{\\gamma}'(s)$ does not exist. A necessary condition for a function to have a $C^1$ extension to a boundary point is that the limit of its derivative exists at that point. Since this condition fails, no $C^1$ extension of the unit-speed curve $\\tilde{\\gamma}(s)$ exists at $s=L$.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\nA. The total length of $\\gamma$ on $[0,\\infty)$ is finite; consequently, the arc-length function $s(t)$ has a finite supremum $L$ as $t\\to\\infty$, and the unit-speed reparametrization by arc-length exists only for $s\\in[0,L)$. This obstructs any global arc-length parametrization on $[0,\\infty)$ along the given image.\nOur analysis shows the total length is $L=\\sqrt{2}$, which is finite. The arc-length function $s(t) = \\sqrt{2}(1-e^{-t})$ maps $[0, \\infty)$ to $[0, \\sqrt{2})$. Thus, the unit-speed reparametrization is defined on $[0, L)$. A \"global arc-length parametrization on $[0,\\infty)$\" implies seeking a unit-speed curve whose parameter domain is the infinite interval $[0,\\infty)$. The length of such a curve would be infinite, but the image of $\\gamma$ has finite length $\\sqrt{2}$. This is a contradiction. The statement is accurate in all its claims.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. The map $t\\mapsto s(t)$ is surjective onto $[0,\\infty)$; hence $\\gamma$ admits a unit-speed reparametrization defined for all $s\\ge 0$ that stays on the same image.\nThe map is $s(t) = \\sqrt{2}(1 - e^{-t})$, whose range on $t \\in [0, \\infty)$ is $[0, \\sqrt{2})$. This is not surjective onto $[0, \\infty)$. The premise is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. The torsion is identically $0$, and the curvature tends to $+\\infty$ as $t\\to\\infty$.\nWe found that $\\tau(t) = 0$ for all $t$ because the curve is planar. We also found that $\\kappa(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}e^t$, which tends to $+\\infty$ as $t\\to\\infty$. Both claims are true.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nD. There exists a once continuously differentiable ($C^{1}$) extension $\\bar{\\gamma}:[0,\\infty]\\to\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ that is regular on $[0,\\infty]$ and for which the unit-speed parametrization extends by continuity to $s=L$.\nA $C^1$ extension of $\\gamma(t)$ to the limit point $t=\\infty$ can be constructed. We have $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\gamma(t) = (0,0,0)$ and $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\gamma'(t) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\sqrt{2}e^{-t}T(t) = (0,0,0)$. So we can define an extension $\\bar{\\gamma}$ with $\\bar{\\gamma}(\\infty)=(0,0,0)$ and $\\bar{\\gamma}'(\\infty)=(0,0,0)$. This extension is $C^1$. However, for a curve to be regular at a point, its derivative must be non-zero. Since $\\bar{\\gamma}'(\\infty)=(0,0,0)$, the extension is not regular at the point $\\infty$. The statement's requirement of regularity on the extended domain $[0, \\infty]$ is not met.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. No $C^{1}$ unit-speed extension through the accumulation point exists: the unit tangent fails to converge as $t\\to\\infty$, so any attempted continuation across the finite arc-length endpoint would fail to be differentiable at $s=L$.\nThis concerns the unit-speed curve $\\tilde{\\gamma}(s)$. A $C^1$ extension to $s=L$ requires the limit $\\lim_{s\\to L^{-}}\\tilde{\\gamma}'(s)$ to exist. This limit is equivalent to $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} T(t)$. As explicitly calculated, the unit tangent vector $T(t)$ oscillates and does not converge. Because its derivative does not converge to a limit, the unit-speed curve $\\tilde{\\gamma}(s)$ cannot be extended to a $C^1$ function at the endpoint $s=L$. The reasoning provided in the statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nFinal summary: Options A, C, and E are the correct statements.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2988154"}]}
