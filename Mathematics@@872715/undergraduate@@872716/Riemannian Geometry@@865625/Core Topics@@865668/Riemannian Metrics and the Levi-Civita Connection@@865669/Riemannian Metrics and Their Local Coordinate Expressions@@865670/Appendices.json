This practice goes back to the fundamental definition: a tensor field that is smooth, symmetric, and positive-definite at every point.

Using only this definition and standard facts about symmetric matrices and their eigenvalues, determine whether $g$ defines a Riemannian metric on all of $M$ by checking symmetry, smoothness, and positive definiteness at every point $(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. As your certificate of positive definiteness, compute the exact analytic expression for the smallest eigenvalue of $g(x,y)$ as a function of $x$ (which is independent of $y$), and provide that expression as your final answer.", "solution": "To determine if the given $(0,2)$-tensor field $g$ defines a Riemannian metric on $M=\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, we must verify that it is smooth, symmetric, and positive-definite at every point $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The components of $g$ in the standard coordinate basis $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\}$ are given by the matrix\n$$\ng(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{11}(x,y) & g_{12}(x,y) \\\\ g_{21}(x,y) & g_{22}(x,y) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & x \\\\ x & 1+x^{2} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nFirst, we check for symmetry. A $(0,2)$-tensor is symmetric if its component matrix is symmetric, meaning $g_{ij} = g_{ji}$ for all $i,j$. In our case, for the non-diagonal components, we have $g_{12}(x,y) = x$ and $g_{21}(x,y) = x$. Since $g_{12} = g_{21}$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the matrix is symmetric, and thus the tensor field $g$ is symmetric.\n\nNext, we check for smoothness. A tensor field is smooth if its component functions are smooth ($C^{\\infty}$) functions on the manifold. The coordinate system $(x,y)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a global smooth chart. The component functions are $g_{11}(x,y) = 1$, $g_{12}(x,y) = x$, $g_{21}(x,y) = x$, and $g_{22}(x,y) = 1+x^{2}$. All component functions are polynomial functions of $x$ and $y$ (in fact, only of $x$), and all polynomial functions are infinitely differentiable. Thus, the tensor field $g$ is smooth.\n\nFinally, we check for positive-definiteness. A symmetric matrix is positive-definite if and only if all of its eigenvalues are strictly positive. We compute the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(g - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\lambda & x \\\\ x & 1+x^{2}-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant gives the characteristic polynomial for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n(1-\\lambda)(1+x^{2}-\\lambda) - x^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^{2} - (2+x^{2})\\lambda + 1 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=-(2+x^{2})$, and $c=1$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{(2+x^{2}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(2+x^{2}))^{2} - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{2+x^{2} \\pm \\sqrt{(2+x^{2})^{2} - 4}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{2+x^{2} \\pm \\sqrt{4x^{2}+x^{4}}}{2} = \\frac{2+x^{2} \\pm \\sqrt{x^{2}(4+x^{2})}}{2} = \\frac{2+x^{2} \\pm |x|\\sqrt{4+x^{2}}}{2}\n$$\nThe two eigenvalues, which depend only on $x$, are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1}(x) = \\frac{2+x^{2} + |x|\\sqrt{4+x^{2}}}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda_{2}(x) = \\frac{2+x^{2} - |x|\\sqrt{4+x^{2}}}{2}\n$$\nThe larger eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}(x)$ is always positive. We must verify that the smaller eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{2}(x)$, is also strictly positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The condition $\\lambda_{2}(x) > 0$ is equivalent to $2+x^{2} > |x|\\sqrt{4+x^{2}}$. Since both sides are non-negative, we can square them:\n$$\n(2+x^{2})^{2} > x^{2}(4+x^{2})\n$$\n$$\n4+4x^{2}+x^{4} > 4x^{2}+x^{4}\n$$\n$$\n4 > 0\n$$\nThis inequality is always true, which proves that $\\lambda_{2}(x) > 0$ for all $x$. Since both eigenvalues are strictly positive for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the tensor field is positive-definite.\n\nHaving satisfied all three conditions (symmetry, smoothness, and positive-definiteness) everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, we conclude that $g$ defines a Riemannian metric.

Compute the components $g'_{ab}(u,v)$ of the metric in $(u,v)$-coordinates and write the corresponding line element $ds^{2}$ explicitly in terms of $du$ and $dv$.

The metric matrix is $g' = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+4u^{2} & 2u \\\\ 2u & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix is symmetric. To check for positive definiteness, we examine its leading principal minors. The first is $1+4u^2 > 0$ for all $u$. The second is the determinant, $\\det(g') = (1+4u^2)(1) - (2u)^2 = 1 > 0$.
