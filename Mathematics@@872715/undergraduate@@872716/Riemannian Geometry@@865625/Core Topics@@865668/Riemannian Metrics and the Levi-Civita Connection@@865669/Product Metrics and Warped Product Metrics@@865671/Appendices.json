The vectors $X$ and $T$ are unit vectors tangent to the $\\mathbb{S}^{2}_{\\rho}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ factors, respectively. The computation must be based on the Koszul formula for the Levi-Civita connection and the definitions of the Riemann curvature tensor and sectional curvature.\n\nFirst, we state the required definitions.\nThe sectional curvature of a $2$-plane spanned by two vectors $U$ and $V$ is defined as\n$$K(U,V) = \\frac{g(R(U,V)V, U)}{g(U,U)g(V,V) - g(U,V)^2}$$\nwhere $R(U,V)W$ is the Riemann curvature tensor, given by\n$$R(U,V)W = \\nabla_U \\nabla_V W - \\nabla_V \\nabla_U W - \\nabla_{[U,V]} W$$\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is uniquely determined by the Koszul formula:\n$$2g(\\nabla_U V, W) = U(g(V,W)) + V(g(U,W)) - W(g(U,V)) + g([U,V],W) - g([U,W],V) - g([V,W],U)$$\nIn our case, the plane is $\\sigma = \\mathrm{span}\\{X, T\\}$. The vector $X$ is tangent to the $\\mathbb{S}^{2}_{\\rho}$ factor, and $T$ is tangent to the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor. In a product manifold, tangent vectors to different factors are orthogonal. Therefore, $g(X,T) = 0$. The problem states that $X$ and $T$ are unit vectors, so $g(X,X) = 1$ and $g(T,T) = 1$. The denominator of the sectional curvature formula becomes $g(X,X)g(T,T) - g(X,T)^2 = (1)(1) - 0^2 = 1$.\nThe expression for the sectional curvature simplifies to:\n$$K(\\sigma) = K(X,T) = g(R(X,T)T, X)$$\nTo evaluate this, we first need to compute $R(X,T)T$. We begin by extending the vectors $X$ and $T$ at the point $(p,t)$ to vector fields in a neighborhood. Let $X$ be a vector field that is everywhere tangent to the spherical factor $\\mathbb{S}^2_\\rho$ and whose components depend only on the coordinates of $\\mathbb{S}^2_\\rho$. Let $T$ be the coordinate vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$, which is everywhere tangent to the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor. For such vector fields, which are lifts from the respective factor manifolds, their Lie bracket is zero: $[X,T] = 0$.\n\nWith $[X,T]=0$, the Riemann tensor expression simplifies to $R(X,T)T = \\nabla_X \\nabla_T T - \\nabla_T \\nabla_X T$. We now compute the required covariant derivatives using the Koszul formula. A general property of product manifolds is that the covariant derivative $\\nabla_U V$ is zero if $U$ and $V$ are vector fields lifted from different factors. We demonstrate this for $\\nabla_X T$. Let $W$ be an arbitrary test vector field on $M$.\n$$2g(\\nabla_X T, W) = X(g(T,W)) + T(g(X,W)) - W(g(X,T)) + g([X,T],W) - g([X,W],T) - g([T,W],X)$$\nSince $g(X,T)=0$ and $[X,T]=0$, the terms $W(g(X,T))$ and $g([X,T],W)$ vanish. To analyze the other terms, we decompose $W$ into its components tangent to the factors, $W = W_S + W_R$. Since $g$ is a product metric, $g(A,B) = 0$ if $A$ is tangent to one factor and $B$ to the other.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $X(g(T,W)) = X(g(T, W_S + W_R)) = X(g(T,W_S)) + X(g(T,W_R)) = X(0) + X(g_R(T,W_R))$. Since $g_R(T,W_R)$ depends only on the $t$ coordinate, $X(g_R(T,W_R)) = 0$.\n    \\item $T(g(X,W)) = T(g(X, W_S + W_R)) = T(g(X,W_S)) + T(g(X,W_R)) = T(g_S(X,W_S)) + T(0)$. Since $g_S(X,W_S)$ depends only on the $\\mathbb{S}^2_\\rho$ coordinates, $T(g_S(X,W_S)) = 0$.\n    \\item $[X,W]$ decomposes as $[X, W_S] + [X, W_R]$. $[X, W_S]$ is tangent to the sphere, and $[X, W_R] = 0$. Thus $g([X,W], T)=g([X,W_S],T)=0$.\n    \\item Similarly, $[T,W]$ decomposes as $[T, W_S] + [T, W_R]$. $[T, W_S]=0$, and $[T, W_R]$ is tangent to the real line. Thus $g([T,W],X)=g([T,W_R],X)=0$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nAll terms in the Koszul formula for $2g(\\nabla_X T, W)$ are zero. Since this holds for any $W$, we conclude that $\\nabla_X T = 0$. By a symmetric argument (or by noting that $\\nabla_X Y - \\nabla_Y X = [X,Y]$ and $[X,T]=0$), it also follows that $\\nabla_T X=0$.\n\nNext, we compute $\\nabla_T T$. The vector field $T=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is a unit vector field on the flat manifold $\\mathbb{R}$. It is a geodesic vector field, meaning its integral curves are geodesics. Thus, we expect $\\nabla_T T = 0$. Using the Koszul formula:\n$$2g(\\nabla_T T, W) = 2T(g(T,W)) - W(g(T,T)) + g([T,T],W) - 2g([T,W],T)$$\nSince $g(T,T)=1$, $W(g(T,T)) = 0$. Also, $[T,T]=0$. The formula simplifies to $2g(\\nabla_T T, W) = 2T(g(T,W)) - 2g([T,W],T)$. Decomposing $W=W_S+W_R$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If $W=W_S$, then $g(T,W_S)=0$ and $[T,W_S]=0$. Thus $g(\\nabla_T T, W_S)=0$.\n    \\item If $W=W_R = f(t)T$, then $g(T,W_R)=f(t)$, so $T(g(T,W_R))=\\frac{df}{dt}$. Also, $[T,W_R]=[T, fT]=T(f)T=\\frac{df}{dt}T$. So $g([T,W_R],T) = g(\\frac{df}{dt}T, T)=\\frac{df}{dt}$. This gives $2g(\\nabla_T T, W_R) = 2\\frac{df}{dt}-2\\frac{df}{dt}=0$.\n\\end{itemize}\nSince $g(\\nabla_T T, W) = 0$ for all $W$, we have $\\nabla_T T = 0$.\n\nNow we can assemble the Riemann tensor term:\n$$R(X,T)T = \\nabla_X \\nabla_T T - \\nabla_T \\nabla_X T - \\nabla_{[X,T]} T$$\nSubstituting the derived results $\\nabla_T T = 0$, $\\nabla_X T = 0$, and $[X,T]=0$:\n$$R(X,T)T = \\nabla_X(0) - \\nabla_T(0) - \\nabla_0 T = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0$$\nFinally, we compute the sectional curvature:\n$$K(\\sigma) = g(R(X,T)T, X) = g(0, X) = 0$$\nThe sectional curvature of any mixed $2$-plane in a Riemannian product manifold is zero.\n\nGeometrically, a non-zero sectional curvature quantifies the deviation of the geometry from being locally Euclidean. The result $K(\\sigma)=0$ signifies that the product structure $(M_1 \\times M_2, g_1+g_2)$ introduces no curvature interaction between the factor manifolds. Parallel transport of a vector tangent to one factor along a curve in the other factor produces no rotation. This \"decoupling\" of the geometries of $\\mathbb{S}^{2}_{\\rho}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ means that a small surface patch generated by geodesics in the directions of $X$ and $T$ is intrinsically flat.

This equation states that $e_1$ must be an eigenvector of the matrix $A$ with an integer eigenvalue $j$.\n\nSince $A \\in \\mathrm{O}(2)$, its eigenvalues must have a modulus of $1$. If an eigenvalue is real, it must be $\\pm 1$. Therefore, the integer eigenvalue $j$ must be either $1$ or $-1$.\n\nLet $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}  a_{12} \\\\ a_{21}  a_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$. The condition $Ae_1 = j e_1$ implies $\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} \\\\ a_{21} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} j \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo, $a_{11} = j \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$ and $a_{21} = 0$.\n\nSince $A$ is an orthogonal matrix, its columns form an orthonormal basis.

This is precisely the general form we derived for any isometry of $M$.\nTherefore, every isometry of $(M,g)$ is a product isometry.

The dimension of the Lie group is the dimension of this manifold, which is $\\dim(S^1) + \\dim(\\mathbb{R}) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n2.  **Number of connected components**: The isometry group is a disjoint union of sets of isometries, indexed by the four possible pairs of signs for $(j,d) \\in \\{(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)\\}$. Each of these four sets is a connected component.\n    - Component $1$: $(j,d)=(1,1)$, maps of the form $(\\theta+c_1, t+c_2)$. This is the identity component.\n    - Component $2$: $(j,d)=(1,-1)$, maps of the form $(\\theta+c_1, -t+c_2)$.\n    - Component $3$: $(j,d)=(-1,1)$, maps of the form $(-\\theta+c_1, t+c_2)$.\n    - Component $4$: $(j,d)=(-1,-1)$, maps of the form $(-\\theta+c_1, -t+c_2)$.\n    Thus, there are $4$ connected components. The component group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n3.  **Number of nonproduct isometries**: As we have shown that all isometries of $(M,g)$ are product isometries, the set of nonproduct isometries is empty.

Its derivatives are $f'(r) = \\cosh(r)$ and $f''(r) = \\sinh(r)$.\nThe fiber is again the unit $(n-1)$-sphere with $K^F = 1$.\n\n-   **Mixed Curvature**: For a plane containing $\\partial_r$ and a tangent vector to $S^{n-1}$:\n    $$K_{\\text{mixed}} = -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} = -\\frac{\\sinh(r)}{\\sinh(r)} = -1.$$\n\n-   **Vertical Curvature**: For a plane tangent to the $S^{n-1}$ fiber:\n    Using the identity $\\cosh^2(r) - \\sinh^2(r) = 1$, we have $1 - \\cosh^2(r) = -\\sinh^2(r)$.\n    $$K_{\\text{vertical}} = \\frac{K^F - (f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} = \\frac{1 - \\cosh^2(r)}{\\sinh^2(r)} = \\frac{-\\sinh^2(r)}{\\sinh^2(r)} = -1.$$\nSince both curvatures are equal to the constant $-1$, the manifold $( (0,\\infty) \\times S^{n-1}, g_{\\sinh})$ is a space of constant sectional curvature $K_{\\mathbb{H}^n} = -1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the ordered pair of constants $(K_{S^n}, K_{\\mathbb{H}^n})$, which is $(1, -1)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3062489"}]}
