The general solution for $h(t)$ is $h(t) = at + b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$.\nThe conditions $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_0)=0$ imply that the scalar projections must also be zero: $h(0) = \\langle J(0), \\dot{\\gamma}(0) \\rangle = 0$ and $h(t_0) = \\langle J(t_0), \\dot{\\gamma}(t_0) \\rangle = 0$.\n$h(0) = a(0) + b = 0 \\implies b=0$.\n$h(t_0) = at_0 = 0$.

This yields a set of scalar ODEs, one for each component:\n$$\nj_i''(t) + K j_i(t) = 0\n$$\nThis is the required scalar ODE for any component of a normal Jacobi field. Since $K0$, this is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The general solution for any such component $j(t)$ is:\n$$\nj(t) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{K}t) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{K}t)\n$$\nFor a non-trivial Jacobi field $J$, at least one of its components $j_i(t)$ must be non-zero. Let's consider one such non-trivial component $j(t)$. The condition $J(0)=0$ implies $j(0)=0$.\n$$\nj(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A = 0\n$$\nSo, the solution must be of the form $j(t) = B \\sin(\\sqrt{K}t)$. For the component to be non-trivial, we must have $B \\neq 0$. This corresponds to a non-zero initial derivative $J'(0)$, since $j'(0) = B\\sqrt{K} \\cos(0) = B\\sqrt{K}$.\n\nThe second condition for a conjugate point is $J(t_0)=0$ for some $t_0  0$. This implies $j(t_0)=0$ for all components.\n$$\nB \\sin(\\sqrt{K} t_0) = 0\n$$\nSince $B \\neq 0$, we must have $\\sin(\\sqrt{K} t_0) = 0$.

The second term is zero.\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for $\\theta$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(a^{2}\\dot{\\theta}) - 0 = 0 \\implies a^{2}\\ddot{\\theta} = 0 \\implies \\ddot{\\theta} = 0\n$$\n\nFor the $z$ coordinate:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\dot{z}} = \\dot{z}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for $z$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{z}) - 0 = 0 \\implies \\ddot{z} = 0\n$$\nIntegrating these second-order ordinary differential equations twice yields the general form of the geodesics:\n$$\n\\theta(t) = v^{\\theta}t + c^{\\theta}\n$$\n$$\nz(t) = v^{z}t + c^{z}\n$$\nwhere $v^{\\theta}, c^{\\theta}, v^{z}, c^{z}$ are constants of integration.\n\nWe require the geodesics to pass through the point $x_{0}=(\\theta_{0},z_{0})$ at $t=0$.

In a complete Riemannian manifold, this infimum is realized by the length of a minimizing geodesic.\n\nA geodesic connecting $P_0$ and $P_1$ is a straight line in the $(\\theta, z)$ coordinate system, but the $\\theta$ coordinate is periodic. A geodesic from $(\\theta_0, z_0)$ to $(\\theta_1, z_1)$ can wrap around the circle $k$ times, for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. In the unwrapped plane, this corresponds to a straight line from $(\\theta_0, z_0)$ to $(\\theta_1 + 2\\pi k, z_1)$.\nLet the geodesic be parameterized by $t \\in [0, 1]$. Then $\\gamma(t) = (\\theta(t), z(t))$ with $\\gamma(0)=P_0$ and $\\gamma(1)=P_1$.

The term $(z_1 - z_0)^2$ is constant with respect to $k$. We need to minimize $(\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k)^2$, which is equivalent to minimizing $|\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k|$. This value represents the shortest angular separation between the angles $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$. Let this minimal angular displacement be denoted by $\\Delta\\theta_{\\min}$.\nThus, the Riemannian distance is:\n$$\nd((\\theta_{0},z_{0}), (\\theta_{1},z_{1})) = \\sqrt{a^{2}(\\Delta\\theta_{\\min})^{2} + (z_{1}-z_{0})^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\theta_{\\min} = \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k|$.\n\n3) **Cut Locus and Minimizing Properties**\n\nThe exponential map at $x_{0}=(\\theta_{0}, z_{0})$ is $\\exp_{x_{0}}: T_{x_{0}}M \\to M$. It maps a vector $v = (v^{\\theta}, v^{z}) \\in T_{x_{0}}M$ to the point $\\gamma_{v}(1)$, where $\\gamma_{v}$ is the geodesic with $\\gamma_{v}(0)=x_{0}$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_{v}(0)=v$. From part 1), $\\gamma_{v}(t) = (\\theta_{0} + v^{\\theta}t, z_{0} + v^{z}t)$, so:\n$$\n\\exp_{x_{0}}(v) = (\\theta_{0} + v^{\\theta}, z_{0} + v^{z}) \\pmod{2\\pi \\text{ in first component}}\n$$\nThe cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(x_0)$ is the set of points $y \\in M$ for which there exist at least two distinct minimizing geodesics from $x_0$ to $y$. A geodesic from $x_0$ ceases to be minimizing when it reaches a point on the cut locus.\n\nA point $(\\theta_1, z_1)$ has two minimizing geodesics from $(\\theta_0, z_0)$ if there are two different integers, say $k_1$ and $k_2$, that yield the same minimal length in the distance formula.\n$$\na^{2}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k_1)^{2} + (z_1 - z_0)^{2} = a^{2}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k_2)^{2} + (z_1 - z_0)^{2}\n$$\nThis implies $|\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k_1| = |\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k_2|$.\nLet $\\delta\\theta = \\theta_1 - \\theta_0$. We need $|\\delta\\theta + 2\\pi k_1| = |\\delta\\theta + 2\\pi k_2|$ for $k_1 \\neq k_2$. Let $k_1=k$ and $k_2=j$. This means $\\delta\\theta + 2\\pi k = -(\\delta\\theta + 2\\pi j)$, so $2\\delta\\theta = -2\\pi(k+j)$, which implies $\\delta\\theta = -\\pi(k+j)$. The minimal non-zero magnitude for $\\delta\\theta$ occurs when $k+j = \\pm 1$, giving $\\delta\\theta = \\mp \\pi$.\nThis means the minimal angular displacement $\\Delta\\theta_{\\min}$ must be $\\pi$. This occurs when two geodesics, wrapping in opposite directions, have the same length. For example, angular displacements of $\\pi$ and $-\\pi$ have the same magnitude.\n\nThe cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(x_0)$ is therefore the set of points $(\\theta_1, z_1)$ such that the minimal angular separation from $\\theta_0$ is $\\pi$. This means $\\theta_1 = \\theta_0 + \\pi \\pmod{2\\pi}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cut}(x_{0}) = \\{ (\\theta, z) \\in S^{1}\\times \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\theta = \\theta_0 + \\pi \\pmod{2\\pi} \\}\n$$\nThis is the line antipodal to $x_{0}$'s generator on the cylinder.\n\nA geodesic from $x_0$ is uniquely minimizing as long as the angular displacement is less than $\\pi$. At an angular displacement of $\\pi$, there are two minimizing geodesics. For any angular displacement greater than $\\pi$, the geodesic is no longer minimizing.\n\n4) **Injectivity Radius**\n\nThe injectivity radius at $x_0$, denoted $\\mathrm{inj}(x_0)$, is the distance from $x_0$ to its cut locus.\n$$\n\\mathrm{inj}(x_0) = d(x_0, \\mathrm{Cut}(x_0)) = \\inf_{y \\in \\mathrm{Cut}(x_0)} d(x_0, y)\n$$\nLet $x_0 = (\\theta_0, z_0)$. A point $y$ in the cut locus has coordinates $(\\theta_0+\\pi, z)$ for some $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We compute the distance between $x_0$ and $y$ using the formula from part 2:\nThe vertical displacement is $z - z_0$. The minimal angular displacement is $(\\theta_0+\\pi) - \\theta_0 = \\pi$.\n$$\nd(x_0, y) = d((\\theta_0, z_0), (\\theta_0+\\pi, z)) = \\sqrt{a^{2}\\pi^{2} + (z-z_0)^2}\n$$\nTo find the injectivity radius, we take the infimum of this distance over all points in the cut locus, which means over all $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{inj}(x_0) = \\inf_{z \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\sqrt{a^{2}\\pi^{2} + (z-z_0)^2}\n$$\nThe expression under the square root is minimized when $(z-z_0)^2$ is minimized. The minimum value of $(z-z_0)^2$ is $0$, which occurs at $z=z_0$.\nTherefore, the injectivity radius is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{inj}(x_0) = \\sqrt{a^{2}\\pi^{2} + 0} = \\sqrt{(a\\pi)^2}\n$$\nSince $a0$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{inj}(x_0) = a\\pi\n$$\nThis value is independent of the point $x_0$, as expected for a homogeneous space like the cylinder.

In the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to the point $(0,0)$ as $n \\to \\infty$. However, the point $(0,0)$ is explicitly excluded from the manifold $M$. Therefore, the Cauchy sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ does not have a limit in $M$. By definition, the metric space $(M, d_M)$ is not complete.\n\nThe classical Hopf–Rinow theorem states that for a connected Riemannian manifold, metric completeness is equivalent to geodesic completeness (the property that every geodesic can be extended to be defined for all real time). Since we have shown that $M$ is not complete as a metric space, the Hopf–Rinow theorem directly implies that $M$ is not geodesically complete. An example of an incomplete geodesic is $\\gamma(t) = (1-t, 0)$ for $t \\in [0, 1)$. This is a straight line starting at $(1,0)$ and moving towards the origin. It is a geodesic in $M$ for any subinterval of $[0,1)$, but it cannot be extended past $t=1$ because $\\gamma(1)=(0,0)$, which is not in $M$.\n\n**Part 2: Existence of a Minimizing Geodesic from $p$ to $q$**\n\nA minimizing geodesic between two points is a geodesic whose length is equal to the Riemannian distance between the points. The geodesics of $(M,g)$ are the same as the geodesics of $(\\mathbb{R}^2, g)$, which are straight lines, so long as they remain in $M$.\n\nIn the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the unique shortest path between $p=(-1,0)$ and $q=(1,0)$ is the straight line segment connecting them. This path can be parameterized by $\\gamma(t) = (2t-1, 0)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. At the parameter value $t=\\frac{1}{2}$, this path passes through the point $\\gamma(\\frac{1}{2})=(0,0)$. Since $(0,0) \\notin M$, this straight line segment is not a valid curve in $M$.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is not available in $M$. Another part of the Hopf–Rinow theorem states that in a complete Riemannian manifold, any two points can be connected by a (not necessarily unique) minimizing geodesic. Since $M$ is not complete, this guarantee does not apply.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that a minimizing geodesic $\\gamma_0$ from $p$ to $q$ exists in $M$. Its length, $L(\\gamma_0)$, would have to be equal to the Riemannian distance $d_M(p,q)$. As we will compute in Part 3, $d_M(p,q)=2$. Thus, if a minimizing geodesic existed, it would have to be a curve in $M$ of length $2$. The only curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ between $p=(-1,0)$ and $q=(1,0)$ with length $2$ is the straight line segment between them. Since this segment is not in $M$, no curve *in* $M$ can have length $2$.\n\nThe infimum of the lengths of paths in $M$ between $p$ and $q$ is $2$, but this infimum is not attained by any specific path in $M$. Consequently, no minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$ exists in $M$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the Riemannian distance $d_M(p,q)$**\n\nThe Riemannian distance $d_M(p,q)$ is the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves in $M$ connecting $p$ to $q$.\n$$d_M(p,q) = \\inf \\{ L(\\gamma) \\mid \\gamma:[0,1] \\to M \\text{ is piecewise smooth, } \\gamma(0)=p, \\gamma(1)=q \\}$$\nwhere the length $L(\\gamma)$ is computed using the Euclidean metric.\n\nFirst, we establish a lower bound. Any curve $\\gamma$ in $M$ is also a curve in the larger space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The length of any curve between two points is always greater than or equal to the straight-line distance between them. The straight-line distance in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ between $p=(-1,0)$ and $q=(1,0)$ is:\n$$d_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(p,q) = \\sqrt{(1 - (-1))^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2} = 2$$\nTherefore, for any admissible curve $\\gamma$ in $M$, its length $L(\\gamma) \\ge 2$. This implies that the infimum must also satisfy $d_M(p,q) \\ge 2$.\n\nNext, we establish an upper bound by constructing a family of curves in $M$ whose lengths approach $2$. For any $\\epsilon  0$, consider the path $\\gamma_\\epsilon$ that consists of three parts:\n1.  The straight line segment from $p=(-1,0)$ to the point $p_\\epsilon = (-\\epsilon, 0)$. The length is $1-\\epsilon$.\n2.  The upper semicircle of radius $\\epsilon$ centered at the origin, from $(-\\epsilon, 0)$ to $(\\epsilon, 0)$. The length is $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi\\epsilon) = \\pi\\epsilon$.\n3.  The straight line segment from $q_\\epsilon = (\\epsilon, 0)$ to $q=(1,0)$. The length is $1-\\epsilon$.\n\nFor any $\\epsilon  0$, this path $\\gamma_\\epsilon$ is a piecewise smooth curve that lies entirely within $M$. Its total length is:\n$$L(\\gamma_\\epsilon) = (1-\\epsilon) + \\pi\\epsilon + (1-\\epsilon) = 2 + (\\pi-2)\\epsilon$$\nSince we can find such a path for any $\\epsilon  0$, the infimum of all path lengths, $d_M(p,q)$, must be less than or equal to the length of any of these specific paths.\n$$d_M(p,q) \\le L(\\gamma_\\epsilon) = 2 + (\\pi-2)\\epsilon$$\nThis inequality holds for all $\\epsilon  0$. Since $\\pi - 2  0$, we can make the term $(\\pi-2)\\epsilon$ arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficiently small $\\epsilon$. Taking the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$ on the right side, we get:\n$$d_M(p,q) \\le \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} (2 + (\\pi-2)\\epsilon) = 2$$\nCombining our two results, $d_M(p,q) \\ge 2$ and $d_M(p,q) \\le 2$, we are forced to conclude that the Riemannian distance is precisely $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3051759"}]}
