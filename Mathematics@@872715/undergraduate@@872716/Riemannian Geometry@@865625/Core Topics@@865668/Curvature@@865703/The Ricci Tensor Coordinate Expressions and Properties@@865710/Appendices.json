Due to the symmetries of the Riemann tensor, if all components of the form $R^i_{\\;j12}$ are zero, then all $R^i_{\\;jkl}$ are zero. Thus, the Riemann curvature tensor vanishes identically on $M$. This is expected, as the metric is just the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ in a different coordinate system, and Euclidean space is flat.\n\n**Step 3: Ricci Tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}_{jk}$**\n\nThe Ricci tensor is defined by the contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{jk} = R^i_{\\;jik} = \\sum_i R^i_{\\;jik}\n$$\nIn our $2$-dimensional case, the components are:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{11} = R^1_{\\;111} + R^2_{\\;121}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{12} = R^1_{\\;112} + R^2_{\\;122}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{21} = R^1_{\\;211} + R^2_{\\;221}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{22} = R^1_{\\;212} + R^2_{\\;222}\n$$\nSince we have shown that all components of the Riemann tensor are zero, $R^i_{\\;jkl} = 0$ for all $i,j,k,l$, it follows directly that every term in the sums above is zero.\nTherefore, all components of the Ricci tensor are zero:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{jk} = 0\n$$\nThis verifies that all components of the Ricci tensor vanish on $M$.

A key result in Riemannian geometry is that despite being constructed from the non-tensorial $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ and their derivatives, the specific combination of terms that forms the Riemann tensor $R^k_{lij}$ (and consequently the Ricci tensor $R_{ij}$) does transform as a tensor. During the transformation of the expression for $R_{ij}$, all the non-tensorial terms involving second and third derivatives of the coordinate map cancel out perfectly. The student's conclusion that $\\mathrm{Ric}$ is not a well-defined tensor is based on the false premise of how $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ transforms.\n\nSecond, the student argues that by choosing normal coordinates at a point $p \\in M$, for which $\\Gamma^k_{ij}(p) = 0$, the expression for the Ricci tensor vanishes, implying $\\mathrm{Ric}(p)=0$. This is a fallacious argument. In such coordinates, while the Christoffel symbols vanish at $p$, their partial derivatives do not, in general. At the point $p$, the quadratic terms in the expression for $R_{ij}$ vanish:\n$$ \\Gamma^p_{ik}(p) \\Gamma^k_{pj}(p) - \\Gamma^p_{ij}(p) \\Gamma^k_{pk}(p) = 0. $$\nHowever, the Ricci tensor components at $p$ are given by the remaining terms:\n$$ R_{ij}(p) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^k_{kj}}{\\partial x^i} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^k_{ij}}{\\partial x^k} \\right)\\bigg|_p. $$\nThese derivatives are, in general, non-zero and are functions of the second derivatives of the metric tensor components at $p$. For a general curved manifold, one cannot make these derivatives vanish simply by a choice of coordinates. The student's reasoning incorrectly assumes that if a function is zero at a point, its derivative must also be zero at that point.\n\nNow we analyze each option.\n\nA. The mistake is treating $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$ as tensor components under coordinate changes. The correction is to use that $\\mathrm{Ric}$ is tensorial: evaluate at a point $p$ in normal coordinates (so $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}(p)=0$) and compute $\\mathrm{Ric}(p)$ as the trace of the curvature tensor $R$ at $p$, which depends on derivatives of $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$ (equivalently, second derivatives of $g$) and is independent of the chosen chart.\nThis option correctly identifies the primary error: treating $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$ as tensor components. It also correctly refutes the student's second flawed argument by pointing out that even when $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}(p)=0$, the Ricci tensor depends on the derivatives of $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$, which are generally non-zero. The suggested correction—to compute the components in a special coordinate system (normal coordinates) and rely on the tensorial nature of $\\mathrm{Ric}$ for the result to be general—is a standard and powerful technique in differential geometry. This statement is entirely accurate.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The mistake is forgetting that the Levi-Civita connection may have torsion in some coordinates. The correction is to include torsion terms in the Christoffel symbols, after which the coordinate expression for $\\mathrm{Ric}$ becomes invariant under changes of chart.\nThis option is factually incorrect. The problem explicitly specifies the Levi-Civita connection, which is defined to be torsion-free. The torsion tensor is a tensor; if its components are zero in one coordinate system, they are zero in all coordinate systems. The concept of a connection \"having torsion in some coordinates\" but not others is meaningless.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The mistake is using a general coordinate frame instead of an orthonormal frame. The correction is to switch to an orthonormal frame; in such frames, Christoffel symbols transform like tensor components, so the coordinate expression for $\\mathrm{Ric}$ becomes invariant.\nThis option contains multiple falsehoods. First, the invariance of the Ricci tensor does not depend on the choice of frame (coordinate or otherwise). Second, it is not true that Christoffel symbols transform as tensor components in an orthonormal frame. Under a change of coordinates, the transformation law for $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ is always inhomogeneous, regardless of the frame type. The connection coefficients associated with a moving frame (often called Ricci rotation coefficients) also have an inhomogeneous transformation law. The central point of the problem is the transformation property under a change of *coordinates*, and this claim is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The mistake is tracing over the wrong pair of indices in the curvature expression. The correction is to first raise an index with $g$ and then trace over the first and third indices; this fixes the invariance problem observed under coordinate changes.\nThis option misdiagnoses the student's error. The student's mistake is a fundamental misunderstanding of transformation laws, not a simple error in the definition of the Ricci trace. The \"invariance problem\" is a consequence of the student's faulty assumption about $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$, and it would persist in their mind for any tensor constructed from Christoffel symbols, no matter how the indices are traced. The Ricci tensor, as standardly defined, is already a well-defined, invariant tensor.

Since $R^r_{rrr}=0$ by the symmetries of the Riemann tensor, we only need $R^\\theta_{r\\theta r}$.\n$$\nR^\\theta_{r\\theta r} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^\\theta_{rr}}{\\partial \\theta} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta}}{\\partial r} + \\Gamma^m_{rr} \\Gamma^\\theta_{m\\theta} - \\Gamma^m_{r\\theta} \\Gamma^\\theta_{mr}\n$$\nUsing the Christoffel symbols we found:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^\\theta_{rr}}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial (0)}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$.\n    \\item $\\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta}}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( \\frac{f'(r)}{f(r)} \\right) = \\frac{f''(r)f(r) - (f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2}$.\n    \\item $\\Gamma^m_{rr} \\Gamma^\\theta_{m\\theta} = 0$ since $\\Gamma^m_{rr}=0$ for all $m$.\n    \\item $\\Gamma^m_{r\\theta} \\Gamma^\\theta_{mr} = \\Gamma^r_{r\\theta} \\Gamma^\\theta_{rr} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r} = (0)(0) + \\left(\\frac{f'(r)}{f(r)}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{f'(r)}{f(r)}\\right)^2$.\n\\end{itemize}\nCombining these terms gives:\n$$\nR^\\theta_{r\\theta r} = 0 - \\frac{f''(r)f(r) - (f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} + 0 - \\left(\\frac{f'(r)}{f(r)}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} + \\frac{(f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} - \\frac{(f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} = -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}\n$$\nThus, the $rr$-component of the Ricci tensor is $R_{rr} = -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}$.\n\nNow, let's compute $R_{\\theta\\theta} = R^j_{\\theta\\theta j} = R^r_{\\theta r\\theta} + R^\\theta_{\\theta\\theta\\theta}$. Since $R^\\theta_{\\theta\\theta\\theta}=0$, we need $R^r_{\\theta r\\theta}$.\n$$\nR^r_{\\theta r\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^r_{\\theta r}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\Gamma^m_{\\theta\\theta} \\Gamma^r_{mr} - \\Gamma^m_{\\theta r} \\Gamma^r_{m\\theta}\n$$\nUsing the Christoffel symbols:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} (-f(r)f'(r)) = -(f'(r))^2 - f(r)f''(r)$.\n    \\item $\\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^r_{\\theta r}}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial (0)}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$.\n    \\item $\\Gamma^m_{\\theta\\theta} \\Gamma^r_{mr} = \\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} \\Gamma^r_{rr} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta\\theta} \\Gamma^r_{\\theta r} = (-f(r)f'(r))(0) + (0)(0) = 0$.\n    \\item $\\Gamma^m_{\\theta r} \\Gamma^r_{m\\theta} = \\Gamma^r_{\\theta r} \\Gamma^r_{r\\theta} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r} \\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = (0)(0) + \\left(\\frac{f'(r)}{f(r)}\\right)(-f(r)f'(r)) = -(f'(r))^2$.\n\\end{itemize}\nCombining these terms gives:\n$$\nR^r_{\\theta r\\theta} = (-(f'(r))^2 - f(r)f''(r)) - 0 + 0 - (-(f'(r))^2) = -f(r)f''(r)\n$$\nThus, the $\\theta\\theta$-component of the Ricci tensor is $R_{\\theta\\theta} = -f(r)f''(r)$.\n\nThe condition $\\mathrm{Ric} = \\lambda g$ translates to the component equations $R_{ij} = \\lambda g_{ij}$.\nFor the $(r,r)$ component:\n$$\nR_{rr} = \\lambda g_{rr} \\implies -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} = \\lambda \\cdot 1\n$$\nThis gives an expression for $\\lambda$: $\\lambda = -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}$.\n\nFor the $(\\theta,\\theta)$ component:\n$$\nR_{\\theta\\theta} = \\lambda g_{\\theta\\theta} \\implies -f(r)f''(r) = \\lambda (f(r))^2\n$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$ from this equation gives $\\lambda = -\\frac{f(r)f''(r)}{(f(r))^2} = -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}$.\n\nBoth component equations yield the same expression for $\\lambda$. This is expected, as it is a known property of two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds that the Ricci tensor is always proportional to the metric tensor, $R_{ij} = K g_{ij}$, where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature. Our derivation shows that $\\lambda = K = -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}$.\n\nThe problem states that $\\lambda$ must be a constant. Therefore, the condition is that the derived expression for $\\lambda$ must be constant with respect to the coordinates. Since $f$ is a function of $r$ only, this means:\n$$\n-\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} = \\mathrm{constant}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the single analytic expression giving $\\lambda$ in terms of $f(r)$ and its derivatives. This is the expression we have derived.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}}\n$$", "id": "3076490"}]}
