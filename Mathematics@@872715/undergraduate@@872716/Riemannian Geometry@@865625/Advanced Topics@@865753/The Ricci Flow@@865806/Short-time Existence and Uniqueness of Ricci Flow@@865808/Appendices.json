We are also asked to find the first singularity time $t_{\\ast}$ when $\\lambda  0$. The derivation must be from first principles, using only the given definitions and the scaling properties of curvature.\n\nGiven the high degree of symmetry implied by the Einstein condition, we seek a solution of the form $g(t) = c(t)g_{0}$, where $c(t)$ is a time-dependent scaling function. For this to be a valid Riemannian metric, we must have $c(t)  0$. The initial condition $g(0) = g_{0}$ implies $c(0)g_{0} = g_{0}$, which gives the initial condition for the scaling function: $c(0) = 1$.\n\nWe substitute this ansatz into the Ricci flow equation.
