Let $(M,g)$ be a smooth, oriented Riemannian surface of dimension $2$. Let $u:M\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function. The conformally related metric is given by $g' = e^{2u}g$. We will address the three parts of the problem in sequence.\n\nFirst, we determine the transformation of the length of a tangent vector. Let $p \\in M$ be a point and let $v \\in T_p M$ be a tangent vector at $p$. The length of $v$ with respect to the metric $g$ is defined as $\\|v\\|_g = \\sqrt{g(v,v)}$. To find the length of $v$ with respect to the new metric $g'$, denoted $\\|v\\|_{g'}$, we use the same definition:\n$$\n\\|v\\|_{g'} = \\sqrt{g'(v,v)}\n$$\nThe metrics $g$ and $g'$ are related by $g' = e^{2u}g$. This means that for any pair of tangent vectors $v, w \\in T_p M$, the inner product is given by $g'(v,w)|_p = e^{2u(p)} g(v,w)|_p$. Applying this to the case where $v=w$, we have:\n$$\ng'(v,v) = e^{2u}g(v,v)\n$$\nHere, $u$ is evaluated at the point $p$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\|v\\|_{g'}$:\n$$\n\\|v\\|_{g'} = \\sqrt{e^{2u}g(v,v)} = \\sqrt{e^{2u}} \\sqrt{g(v,v)}\n$$\nSince $u$ is a real-valued function, $e^{2u}$ is always positive, so $\\sqrt{e^{2u}} = e^u$. Thus, we find the relationship between the lengths:\n$$\n\\|v\\|_{g'} = e^{u} \\|v\\|_g\n$$\nThe length of a tangent vector is scaled by a factor of $e^u$ under the conformal transformation.\n\nSecond, we determine how the angle between two nonzero tangent vectors transforms. Let $v, w \\in T_p M$ be two nonzero tangent vectors. The angle $\\theta_g$ between them with respect to the metric $g$ is defined by the relation:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta_g = \\frac{g(v,w)}{\\|v\\|_g \\|w\\|_g}\n$$\nSimilarly, the angle $\\theta_{g'}$ with respect to the metric $g'$ is defined by:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta_{g'} = \\frac{g'(v,w)}{\\|v\\|_{g'} \\|w\\|_{g'}}\n$$\nWe substitute the transformation rules for the inner product and the lengths that we have just derived. The numerator transforms as:\n$$\ng'(v,w) = e^{2u}g(v,w)\n$$\nThe lengths in the denominator transform as:\n$$\n\\|v\\|_{g'} = e^u \\|v\\|_g\n$$\n$$\n\\|w\\|_{g'} = e^u \\|w\\|_g\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\cos\\theta_{g'}$:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta_{g'} = \\frac{e^{2u}g(v,w)}{(e^u \\|v\\|_g) (e^u \\|w\\|_g)} = \\frac{e^{2u}g(v,w)}{e^{2u} \\|v\\|_g \\|w\\|_g} = \\frac{g(v,w)}{\\|v\\|_g \\|w\\|_g}\n$$\nWe observe that the right-hand side is precisely the expression for $\\cos\\theta_g$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta_{g'} = \\cos\\theta_g\n$$\nSince the angle is typically taken to be in the interval $[0, \\pi]$, and the cosine function is one-to-one on this interval, we can conclude that $\\theta_{g'} = \\theta_g$. This confirms the defining property of a conformal transformation: it preserves angles.\n\nThird, we compute the transformed area element $d\\mu_{g'}$. In a local coordinate chart $(x^1, x^2)$, the area element for a metric $h$ is given by $d\\mu_h = \\sqrt{\\det(h_{ij})} \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2$, where $h_{ij}$ are the components of the metric $h$ in this chart.\nFor the metric $g$, the components are $g_{ij} = g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j})$, and the area element is $d\\mu_g = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2$.\nFor the conformally transformed metric $g' = e^{2u}g$, its components $g'_{ij}$ are:\n$$\ng'_{ij} = g'\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\\right) = e^{2u} g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\\right) = e^{2u} g_{ij}\n$$\nLet $G$ be the $2 \\times 2$ matrix with entries $g_{ij}$, and $G'$ be the $2 \\times 2$ matrix with entries $g'_{ij}$. The relationship between the matrices is $G' = e^{2u}G$. We need to compute the determinant of $G'$. Using the property of determinants that for an $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ and a scalar $c$, $\\det(cA) = c^n \\det(A)$, we have for our $2 \\times 2$ matrices:\n$$\n\\det(g'_{ij}) = \\det(e^{2u}G) = (e^{2u})^2 \\det(G) = e^{4u} \\det(g_{ij})\n$$\nNow we can write the area element for $g'$:\n$$\nd\\mu_{g'} = \\sqrt{\\det(g'_{ij})} \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 = \\sqrt{e^{4u} \\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2\n$$\nSince $e^{4u}$ is positive, we can pull it out of the square root:\n$$\nd\\mu_{g'} = \\sqrt{e^{4u}} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 = e^{2u} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2\n$$\nRecognizing that $d\\mu_g = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2$, we obtain the final transformation rule for the area element:\n$$\nd\\mu_{g'} = e^{2u} d\\mu_g\n$$\nThe problem asks for the multiplicative factor $F(u)$ such that $d\\mu_{g'} = F(u) d\\mu_g$.

For a general conformal change of metric $g' = e^{2f} g$ on a surface, the Gaussian curvatures $K'$ and $K$ are related by the formula $K' = e^{-2f}(K - \\Delta_g f)$, where $\\Delta_g$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator with respect to the metric $g$.\nIn our case, $g' = g(t)$, $g = g_{0}$, and the conformal factor is $c(t)$. So, we can write $c(t) = e^{2f(t)}$, where $f(t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(c(t))$. Since $c(t)$ depends only on time, the function $f$ is spatially constant for any fixed $t$.
