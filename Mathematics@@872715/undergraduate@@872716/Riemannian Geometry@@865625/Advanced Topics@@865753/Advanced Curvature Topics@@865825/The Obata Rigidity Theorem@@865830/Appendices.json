We shall proceed by first calculating the two integrals comprising the Rayleigh quotient and then discussing the connection to the Lichnerowicz–Obata theorem.\n\nThe Rayleigh quotient for a function $f$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is given by\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(f) = \\frac{\\int_M |\\nabla f|^2 \\, d\\mu}{\\int_M f^2 \\, d\\mu}\n$$\nIn this problem, the manifold is the unit $2$-sphere $S^2$, equipped with the standard metric $g$ which in spherical coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi)$ is given by the line element $ds^2 = d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$. The metric tensor and its inverse are:\n$$\ng_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  \\sin^2\\theta \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad g^{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Riemannian volume element is $d\\mu = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\,d\\theta\\,d\\phi = \\sin\\theta\\, d\\theta\\, d\\phi$.

The limits of integration change from $\\theta=0$ to $u=1$ and $\\theta=\\pi$ to $u=-1$:\n$$\n2\\pi \\int_1^{-1} u^2 (-du) = 2\\pi \\int_{-1}^1 u^2 \\, du = 2\\pi \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_{-1}^1 = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{1^3}{3} - \\frac{(-1)^3}{3} \\right) = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\n$$\nSo, the denominator is $\\int_{S^2} f^2 \\, d\\mu = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerator, $\\int_{S^2} |\\nabla f|^2 \\, d\\mu$. We must first find the gradient vector field $\\nabla f$ and its squared norm $|\\nabla f|^2$. The components of the gradient are given by $(\\nabla f)^i = g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j}$. The partial derivatives of $f(\\theta, \\phi) = \\cos\\theta$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = -\\sin\\theta, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi} = 0\n$$\nThe squared norm of the gradient is $|\\nabla f|^2 = g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j}$. In our coordinates:\n$$\n|\\nabla f|^2 = g^{\\theta\\theta} \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2 + g^{\\phi\\phi} \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)^2 = (1)(-\\sin\\theta)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\right)(0)^2 = \\sin^2\\theta\n$$\nNow we can compute the integral for the numerator:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} |\\nabla f|^2 \\, d\\mu = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi (\\sin^2\\theta) (\\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\sin^3\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi\n$$\nAgain, integrating over $\\phi$ gives a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} |\\nabla f|^2 \\, d\\mu = 2\\pi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin^3\\theta \\, d\\theta = 2\\pi \\int_0^\\pi (1-\\cos^2\\theta)\\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta\n$$\nUsing the same substitution $u = \\cos\\theta$:\n$$\n2\\pi \\int_1^{-1} (1-u^2)(-du) = 2\\pi \\int_{-1}^1 (1-u^2) \\, du = 2\\pi \\left[ u - \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_{-1}^1\n$$\n$$\n= 2\\pi \\left( \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\left(-1 - \\frac{-1}{3}\\right) \\right) = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{2}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\right) = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right) = \\frac{8\\pi}{3}\n$$\nSo, the numerator is $\\int_{S^2} |\\nabla f|^2 \\, d\\mu = \\frac{8\\pi}{3}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Rayleigh quotient:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(f) = \\frac{\\int_{S^2} |\\nabla f|^2 \\, d\\mu}{\\int_{S^2} f^2 \\, d\\mu} = \\frac{8\\pi/3}{4\\pi/3} = 2\n$$\nThis confirms the expected value.\n\nThe connection to the Lichnerowicz–Obata estimate is as follows. The first non-zero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ of the Laplace–Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ on a compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is variationally characterized by the Rayleigh quotient:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = \\inf \\left\\{ \\mathcal{R}(h) \\, \\Big| \\, h \\in C^\\infty(M), h \\not\\equiv 0, \\int_M h \\, d\\mu = 0 \\right\\}\n$$\nThe Lichnerowicz estimate provides a lower bound for $\\lambda_1$. For an $n$-dimensional compact manifold $(M,g)$ with Ricci curvature satisfying $\\operatorname{Ric}(X,X) \\ge (n-1)k|X|^2$ for a constant $k  0$, the estimate is $\\lambda_1 \\ge nk$.\n\nFor the standard unit $2$-sphere $S^2$, we have dimension $n=2$ and the Ricci curvature is $\\operatorname{Ric} = (2-1)g = g$, which means we can take $k=1$. The Lichnerowicz estimate thus gives $\\lambda_1 \\ge 2(1) = 2$.\n\nThe function $f(\\theta,\\phi)=\\cos\\theta$ is orthogonal to the constant functions (the eigenspace of $\\lambda_0=0$), as $\\int_{S^2} \\cos\\theta \\, d\\mu = 0$. Our calculation shows that for this function, $\\mathcal{R}(f)=2$. Since $\\lambda_1$ is the infimum of the Rayleigh quotient over all such functions, we must have $\\lambda_1 \\le \\mathcal{R}(f) = 2$.\nCombining the estimate with our calculation, we have $2 \\le \\lambda_1 \\le 2$, which proves that the first non-zero eigenvalue on the unit $2$-sphere is exactly $\\lambda_1=2$.\n\nThis calculation explicitly shows that the lower bound provided by the Lichnerowicz estimate is achieved on the unit sphere.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. We proceed with the solution. The problem consists of two main parts concerning the flat $n$-torus $(T^n, g)$.\n\nPart 1: Proof that the Ricci curvature of $(T^n,g)$ is identically zero.\n\nThe $n$-torus $T^n$ is defined as the quotient manifold $T^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The Riemannian metric $g$ on $T^n$ is induced by the standard Euclidean metric $g_{E}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This means that the canonical projection map $\\pi: (\\mathbb{R}^n, g_E) \\to (T^n, g)$ is a local isometry.\n\nLet $R_{T^n}$ and $R_{\\mathbb{R}^n}$ denote the Riemann curvature tensors of $(T^n, g)$ and $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_E)$, respectively. A fundamental property of local isometries is that they preserve the Riemann curvature tensor. For any point $p \\in T^n$, we can choose a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ and a corresponding neighborhood $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that the restriction of the projection map, $\\pi|_V : V \\to U$, is an isometry. Consequently, for any point $q \\in V$ mapping to $\\pi(q) \\in U$, the curvature tensor of $T^n$ at $\\pi(q)$ is equal to the curvature tensor of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ at $q$.\n\nThe problem states as a given fact that the Riemann curvature tensor on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard Euclidean metric is identically zero. That is, $R_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\equiv 0$. Since for every point $p \\in T^n$ there exists a local isometry from a neighborhood in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to a neighborhood of $p$, it follows that the Riemann curvature tensor of the torus, $R_{T^n}$, must also be identically zero everywhere.\n\nThe Ricci curvature tensor, $\\operatorname{Ric}$, is defined as a trace of the full Riemann curvature tensor $R$. In local coordinates, its components are given by $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = R^k_{ikj} = g^{kl} R_{likj}$. In a more coordinate-free manner, for any tangent vectors $X$ and $Y$, the Ricci tensor is given by $\\operatorname{Ric}(X, Y) = \\operatorname{tr}(Z \\mapsto R(Z, X)Y)$. If the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is identically zero, then all of its traces must also be identically zero.\n\nTherefore, because $R_{T^n} \\equiv 0$, it follows directly that the Ricci curvature tensor of the torus is also identically zero, i.e., $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the first nonzero eigenvalue of $\\Delta$ on $(T^n,g)$ and its relation to the Lichnerowicz–Obata theorem.\n\nThe Laplace–Beltrami operator on $(T^n, g)$ acts on smooth functions $f: T^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$. Such functions can be identified with smooth functions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ that are periodic with respect to the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$, i.e., $f(x+k) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$.\n\nSince the metric on $T^n$ is locally Euclidean, the expression for the Laplacian in the standard Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ inherited from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the same as the standard Euclidean Laplacian. With the given sign convention $\\Delta = -\\operatorname{div}(\\nabla f)$, this is:\n$$\n\\Delta = -\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial(x^j)^2}\n$$\nThe problem states that smooth functions on $T^n$ admit Fourier series expansions. A basis for the space of square-integrable functions $L^2(T^n)$ is given by the set of complex exponential functions $\\{f_k(x) = \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle) \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n\\}$, where $k = (k_1, \\dots, k_n)$ is a vector of integers and $\\langle k, x \\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^n k_j x^j$. These functions are the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian. To find the eigenvalues, we apply $\\Delta$ to an eigenfunction $f_k(x)$:\n$$\n\\Delta f_k(x) = -\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial(x^j)^2} \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle)\n$$\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle) = (2\\pi i k_j) \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial(x^j)^2} \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle) = (2\\pi i k_j)^2 \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle) = -4\\pi^2 k_j^2 \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the Laplacian:\n$$\n\\Delta f_k(x) = -\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (-4\\pi^2 k_j^2) f_k(x) = \\left(4\\pi^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k_j^2\\right) f_k(x) = (4\\pi^2 \\|k\\|^2) f_k(x)\n$$\nwhere $\\|k\\|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n k_j^2$ is the squared Euclidean norm of the integer vector $k$.\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of $\\Delta$ on $T^n$ are given by $\\lambda_k = 4\\pi^2 \\|k\\|^2$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The spectrum of the Laplacian is the set of these values.\nThe lowest eigenvalue corresponds to $k=0$, which gives $\\lambda_0 = 4\\pi^2 \\|0\\|^2 = 0$. The corresponding eigenfunctions are constant functions.\nThe problem asks for the first *nonzero* eigenvalue, denoted $\\lambda_1$. This corresponds to the smallest possible positive value of $\\lambda_k$. This occurs for the integer vectors $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ for which $\\|k\\|^2$ is minimized, subject to $k \\neq 0$. The minimum nonzero value of $\\|k\\|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n k_j^2$ for $k_j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is $1$. This is achieved when one component $k_j$ is $\\pm 1$ and all other components are $0$.\nTherefore, the first nonzero eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = 4\\pi^2 \\cdot 1 = 4\\pi^2\n$$\nRegarding the Lichnerowicz–Obata theorem: This theorem provides a sharp lower bound on the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold under a strictly positive lower bound on its Ricci curvature. Specifically, if $(M^n, g)$ is a compact $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with $\\operatorname{Ric}(X, X) \\ge (n-1)c g(X, X)$ for some constant $c  0$, then $\\lambda_1 \\ge nc$. The theorem further states that equality $\\lambda_1 = nc$ holds if and only if $(M, g)$ is isometric to the standard $n$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^n$ of constant sectional curvature $c$.\n\nThe flat torus $(T^n, g)$ provides a crucial example illustrating why the hypothesis $c  0$ cannot be dropped. For the torus, we proved that $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$. This satisfies the condition $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)c g$ for the limiting case $c=0$. However, the torus $T^n$ is topologically and geometrically distinct from the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^n$ (for $n \\ge 2$, their fundamental groups are $\\pi_1(T^n) = \\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{S}^n) = \\{e\\}$). The existence of the flat torus, a non-spherical manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature, demonstrates that the powerful rigidity conclusion of the Lichnerowicz-Obata theorem (i.e., that the manifold must be a sphere) collapses when the Ricci curvature is allowed to be zero. The strictly positive lower bound on Ricci curvature is therefore an essential hypothesis for the theorem's characterization of the sphere.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4\\pi^{2}}$$", "id": "3075196"}, {"introduction": "The relationship between curvature and the spectrum can be subtle, as manifolds can satisfy curvature bounds without meeting the Obata theorem's equality condition.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Part 1: Computation of the first nonzero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n)$\n\nThe real projective space $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is defined as the quotient of the unit sphere $S^n$ by the antipodal equivalence relation, $x \\sim -x$ for $x \\in S^n$. The map $\\pi: S^n \\to \\mathbb{RP}^n$ is a $2$-to-$1$ covering map.\n\nA smooth function $f$ on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ can be lifted to a smooth function $\\tilde{f}$ on $S^n$ by composition with the covering map, $\\tilde{f} = f \\circ \\pi$. By the definition of the quotient space, a point $p \\in \\mathbb{RP}^n$ corresponds to a pair of antipodal points $\\{x, -x\\}$ on $S^n$. Thus, for the lifted function $\\tilde{f}$ to be well-defined from $f$, it must satisfy $\\tilde{f}(x) = f(\\pi(x)) = f(\\pi(-x)) = \\tilde{f}(-x)$. This means that any function on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ lifts to an **even** function on $S^n$ (i.e., a function invariant under the antipodal map). Conversely, any even function on $S^n$ descends to a well-defined function on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$.\n\nThe problem states that the covering map $\\pi$ is a local isometry. A key property of local isometries is that they preserve the Laplace–Beltrami operator. Specifically, if $\\tilde{f} = f \\circ \\pi$, then $\\Delta_{S^n} \\tilde{f} = (\\Delta_{\\mathbb{RP}^n} f) \\circ \\pi$. Consequently, if $f$ is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$, i.e., $\\Delta_{\\mathbb{RP}^n} f + \\lambda f = 0$, then its lift $\\tilde{f}$ is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian on $S^n$ with the same eigenvalue:\n$$\n\\Delta_{S^n} \\tilde{f} + \\lambda \\tilde{f} = (\\Delta_{\\mathbb{RP}^n} f) \\circ \\pi + \\lambda (f \\circ \\pi) = (\\Delta_{\\mathbb{RP}^n} f + \\lambda f) \\circ \\pi = 0 \\circ \\pi = 0\n$$\nThis establishes that the spectrum of the Laplacian on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is a subset of the spectrum of the Laplacian on $S^n$. The eigenfunctions on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ correspond precisely to the **even** eigenfunctions on $S^n$.\n\nWe are given that the eigenfunctions on $S^n$ are spherical harmonics, which are restrictions of homogeneous harmonic polynomials from $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ to $S^n$. Let $P(x)$ be a homogeneous polynomial of degree $k$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The corresponding function on $S^n$ is $u(x) = P(x)|_{S^n}$. For $u(x)$ to be an even function, we require $u(-x) = u(x)$ for all $x \\in S^n$. Since $P$ is homogeneous of degree $k$, $P(-x) = (-1)^k P(x)$. Therefore, $u(-x) = (-1)^k u(x)$. The condition $u(-x) = u(x)$ implies that $(-1)^k = 1$, which holds if and only if the degree $k$ is an even integer.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $-\\Delta$ on $S^n$ are given by $\\lambda_k = k(k+n-1)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{0\\}$. The eigenvalues of $-\\Delta$ on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ are those $\\lambda_k$ for which the corresponding eigenfunctions are even. This corresponds to the set of eigenvalues where $k$ is an even non-negative integer:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}(-\\Delta_{\\mathbb{RP}^n}) = \\{ k(k+n-1) \\mid k \\in \\{0, 2, 4, \\dots\\} \\}\n$$\nThe first eigenvalue is for $k=0$, which gives $\\lambda_0 = 0(0+n-1) = 0$. This is the eigenvalue for constant functions. The first **nonzero** eigenvalue, denoted $\\lambda_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n)$, corresponds to the smallest positive even integer, which is $k=2$.\nSubstituting $k=2$ into the formula, we find:\n$$\n\\lambda_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n) = 2(2 + n - 1) = 2(n+1)\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Justification regarding the Lichnerowicz–Obata estimate\n\nThe Lichnerowicz–Obata theorem states that for a complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with Ricci curvature bounded below by $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)g$, the first nonzero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ of the Laplacian satisfies $\\lambda_1 \\ge n$. The equality $\\lambda_1 = n$ holds if and only if $(M,g)$ is isometric to the standard unit sphere $S^n$.\n\nFor $\\mathbb{RP}^n$, the problem states that $\\operatorname{Ric}=(n-1)g$. This corresponds to the condition of the theorem with a constant sectional curvature of $K=1$. The Lichnerowicz–Obata inequality for $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is thus $\\lambda_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n) \\ge n(1) = n$. From our calculation in Part 1, we have $\\lambda_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n)=2(n+1)$. The inequality $2(n+1) \\ge n$ simplifies to $2n+2 \\ge n$, or $n+2 \\ge 0$, which is true for any dimension $n \\ge 1$.\n\nThe equality case, $\\lambda_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n) = n$, would imply, by Obata's rigidity theorem, that $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is isometric to $S^n$. However, $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is not isometric to $S^n$ for any $n \\ge 1$. For $n \\ge 2$, $S^n$ is simply connected while $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ has a fundamental group $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$, so they are not even homeomorphic. For $n=1$, $S^1$ and $\\mathbb{RP}^1$ are both circles, but the standard metric on $S^1$ gives it length $2\\pi$, whereas the quotient metric on $\\mathbb{RP}^1$ gives it length $\\pi$, so they are not isometric.\n\nThe reason for this strict inequality can be understood at the level of eigenfunctions, as requested by the problem's framework. The equality $\\lambda_1=n$ on the sphere $S^n$ is achieved by the eigenfunctions corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1(S^n) = 1(1+n-1) = n$. These are the spherical harmonics of degree $k=1$. As established earlier, an eigenfunction on $S^n$ arising from a homogeneous polynomial of degree $k$ is odd if $k$ is odd and even if $k$ is even. Therefore, the eigenfunctions corresponding to $\\lambda=n$ (i.e., for $k=1$) on $S^n$ are all **odd** functions.\n\nHowever, the spectrum of $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ consists only of eigenvalues corresponding to **even** eigenfunctions on $S^n$. Since the eigenfunctions on $S^n$ that would satisfy the equality condition (those for $k=1$) are all odd, they cannot descend to well-defined functions on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$. The eigenspace for $\\lambda=n$ on $S^n$ and the space of even functions on $S^n$ have only the trivial function $\\{0\\}$ in their intersection. Consequently, $\\lambda=n$ is not an eigenvalue of the Laplacian on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$. The smallest available nonzero eigenvalue for $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ must correspond to the smallest nonzero even degree, $k=2$, which yields $\\lambda_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n) = 2(n+1)$, a value strictly greater than $n$ for $n \\ge 1$. Thus, the equality case of the Lichnerowicz–Obata estimate cannot occur on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$.\n\nThe final requested expression is the value for the first nonzero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2(n+1)}$$", "id": "3075201"}]}
