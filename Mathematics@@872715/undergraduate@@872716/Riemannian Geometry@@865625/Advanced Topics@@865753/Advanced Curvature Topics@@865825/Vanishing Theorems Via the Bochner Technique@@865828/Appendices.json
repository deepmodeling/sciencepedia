We will address each part in sequence.\n\nFirst, we compute the Ricci tensor for the $n$-dimensional sphere $S^n$ with its standard metric of constant sectional curvature $K=1$. The Riemann curvature tensor of a Riemannian manifold $(M^n, g)$ with constant sectional curvature $K$ is given by the formula for its $(0,4)$-version:\n$$R(X, Y, Z, W) = K \\left( g(Y, Z)g(X, W) - g(X, Z)g(Y, W) \\right)$$\nfor any vector fields $X, Y, Z, W$. For $S^n$, we are given $K=1$, so\n$$R(X, Y, Z, W) = g(Y, Z)g(X, W) - g(X, Z)g(Y, W)$$\nThe Ricci tensor, $\\operatorname{Ric}$, is a $(0,2)$-tensor obtained by taking the trace of the Riemann curvature tensor. Specifically, for any vector fields $Y, W$, its value is given by $\\operatorname{Ric}(Y, W) = \\operatorname{tr}(X \\mapsto R(X,Y)W)$. To compute this trace, we can choose an arbitrary point $p \\in M$ and a local orthonormal basis $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ for the tangent space $T_pM$. The trace is then the sum:\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}(Y, W) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(R(E_i, Y)W, E_i)$$\nBy the symmetries of the Riemann tensor, $g(R(E_i, Y)W, E_i) = R(E_i, Y, W, E_i)$. Therefore,\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}(Y, W) = \\sum_{i=1}^n R(E_i, Y, W, E_i)$$\nSubstituting the expression for the Riemann tensor of $S^n$:\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}(Y, W) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( g(Y, W)g(E_i, E_i) - g(E_i, W)g(Y, E_i) \\right)$$\nSince $\\{E_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, $g(E_i, E_j) = \\delta_{ij}$. The first term in the sum becomes:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n g(Y, W)g(E_i, E_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(Y, W) \\cdot 1 = n \\cdot g(Y, W)$$\nFor the second term, we recognize that for any vector $V$, its components in this basis are $V_i = g(V, E_i)$, and the inner product of two vectors $Y, W$ is $g(Y, W) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(Y, E_i)g(W, E_i)$. Thus:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n g(E_i, W)g(Y, E_i) = g(Y, W)$$\nCombining these results, the Ricci tensor for $S^n$ is:\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}(Y, W) = n \\cdot g(Y, W) - g(Y, W) = (n-1)g(Y, W)$$\nAs a tensor, we write this as $\\operatorname{Ric}_{S^n} = (n-1)g$.\n\nSecond, we compute the Ricci tensor for the $n$-dimensional flat torus $T^n$. The term \"flat\" signifies that the Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. This is because $T^n$ inherits its metric from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which is flat. Thus, for any vector fields $X, Y, Z, W$:\n$$R(X, Y, Z, W) = 0$$\nSince the Ricci tensor is a trace of the Riemann curvature tensor, the trace of the zero tensor is necessarily the zero tensor. Therefore, for the flat torus $T^n$:\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}_{T^n} = 0$$\n\nThird, we use the Bochner technique to interpret these results. The central tool is the Weitzenböck identity for a $1$-form $\\alpha$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$:\n$$\\Delta_d \\alpha = \\nabla^*\\nabla \\alpha + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha)$$\nHere, $\\Delta_d = d\\delta + \\delta d$ is the Hodge Laplacian on forms, $\\nabla^*\\nabla$ is the connection Laplacian (or rough Laplacian), and $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha)$ should be understood as the $1$-form metrically equivalent to the vector field $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha^\\sharp, \\cdot)$, where $\\alpha^\\sharp$ is the vector field dual to $\\alpha$ via the metric. A $1$-form $\\alpha$ is defined as harmonic if $\\Delta_d \\alpha = 0$. For a harmonic $1$-form on a compact, orientable Riemannian manifold $M$ (which both $S^n$ and $T^n$ are), we can take the global inner product of the Weitzenböck identity with $\\alpha$ and integrate over $M$:\n$$\\int_M \\langle \\Delta_d \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle \\, dV_g = 0$$\nFor a harmonic form, this gives:\n$$\\int_M \\langle \\nabla^*\\nabla \\alpha + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha), \\alpha \\rangle \\, dV_g = 0$$\nUsing integration by parts (Green's identity), we have $\\int_M \\langle \\nabla^*\\nabla \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle \\, dV_g = \\int_M |\\nabla \\alpha|^2 \\, dV_g$. The curvature term is $\\langle \\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha), \\alpha \\rangle = \\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha^\\sharp, \\alpha^\\sharp)$. This leads to the Bochner formula for a harmonic $1$-form $\\alpha$:\n$$\\int_M \\left( |\\nabla \\alpha|^2 + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha^\\sharp, \\alpha^\\sharp) \\right) \\, dV_g = 0$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to our two manifolds.\n\nFor $S^n$, assuming $n \\geq 2$, we have $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1)g$. The curvature term in the integral becomes:\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha^\\sharp, \\alpha^\\sharp) = (n-1)g(\\alpha^\\sharp, \\alpha^\\sharp) = (n-1)|\\alpha|^2$$\nThe Bochner formula for $S^n$ is:\n$$\\int_{S^n} \\left( |\\nabla \\alpha|^2 + (n-1)|\\alpha|^2 \\right) \\, dV_g = 0$$\nThe term $|\\nabla \\alpha|^2$ is the squared norm of a tensor, so it is non-negative. For $n \\ge 2$, the factor $(n-1)$ is positive, so $(n-1)|\\alpha|^2$ is also non-negative. The integral of a sum of non-negative continuous functions over $S^n$ can be zero only if the integrand is identically zero. This implies:\n$$|\\nabla \\alpha|^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (n-1)|\\alpha|^2 = 0$$\nThe second equality implies $|\\alpha|^2 = 0$ since $n \\ge 2$, which means the $1$-form $\\alpha$ must be the zero form everywhere. Therefore, there are no non-zero harmonic $1$-forms on $S^n$ for $n \\ge 2$. By the Hodge theorem, this means the first de Rham cohomology group $H^1_{dR}(S^n, \\mathbb{R})$ is trivial. This demonstrates how positive Ricci curvature constrains the topology of the manifold. For $n=1$, $S^1$ is flat, so its Ricci tensor is zero, just like $T^1$.\n\nFor $T^n$, we have $\\operatorname{Ric} = 0$. The Bochner formula simplifies significantly:\n$$\\int_{T^n} |\\nabla \\alpha|^2 \\, dV_g = 0$$\nThis implies that $|\\nabla \\alpha|^2 = 0$ everywhere, which means $\\nabla \\alpha = 0$. Thus, any harmonic $1$-form on the flat torus must be a parallel $1$-form. On $T^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$ with its flat metric, the Christoffel symbols are zero in the standard coordinate system $\\{x^i\\}$. A $1$-form $\\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i dx^i$ with constant coefficients $c_i$ has $\\nabla \\alpha = 0$ and is therefore parallel. Such forms are also harmonic: they are closed ($d\\alpha=0$ because coefficients are constant) and co-closed ($\\delta \\alpha = 0$ because the metric components are constant). Since we can choose non-zero constants $c_i$, there exists an $n$-dimensional space of non-zero harmonic $1$-forms on $T^n$, spanned by $\\{dx^1, \\dots, dx^n\\}$. This is consistent with $H^1_{dR}(T^n, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$. The vanishing Ricci curvature poses no obstruction and instead characterizes the harmonic forms as being precisely the parallel forms.\n\nIn summary, the positive Ricci curvature of $S^n$ ($n \\ge 2$) forces harmonic $1$-forms to vanish, while the zero Ricci curvature of $T^n$ allows for a rich space of harmonic $1$-forms.\nThe Ricci tensors are $\\operatorname{Ric}_{S^n} = (n-1)g$ and $\\operatorname{Ric}_{T^n} = 0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(n-1)g & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3079733"}, {"introduction": "After establishing that positive Ricci curvature eliminates harmonic 1-forms, a natural question arises: does this principle extend to higher-degree forms?

It is a valid problem in differential geometry. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n**2. Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula. For any differential $p$-form $\\omega$ on a compact, oriented Riemannian manifold $\\left(M,g\\right)$, we have:\n$$ \\int_M \\langle \\Delta_H \\omega, \\omega \\rangle \\, dV_g = \\int_M |\\nabla \\omega|^2 \\, dV_g + \\int_M \\langle \\mathcal{R}_p(\\omega), \\omega \\rangle \\, dV_g $$\nwhere $\\Delta_H = d\\delta + \\delta d$ is the Hodge Laplacian, $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection extended to forms, and $\\mathcal{R}_p$ is the curvature operator acting on $p$-forms.\n\nA form $\\omega$ is harmonic if $\\Delta_H \\omega = 0$. For a harmonic form, the formula simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = \\int_M |\\nabla \\omega|^2 \\, dV_g + \\int_M \\langle \\mathcal{R}_p(\\omega), \\omega \\rangle \\, dV_g $$\nSince $|\\nabla \\omega|^2 \\ge 0$, a sufficient condition to prove that $\\omega$ must be the zero form is to show that the curvature term $\\langle \\mathcal{R}_p(\\omega), \\omega \\rangle$ is strictly positive for any non-zero $p$-form $\\omega$.\n\nFor $p=1$, the curvature term simplifies: at any point $x \\in M$, $\\langle \\mathcal{R}_1(\\omega), \\omega \\rangle_x = \\operatorname{Ric}_g(X, X)$, where $X$ is the vector field metrically dual to the $1$-form $\\omega$. Thus, if $\\operatorname{Ric}_g > 0$ (positive definite Ricci curvature), then for any non-zero harmonic $1$-form $\\omega$, the integrand is strictly positive, leading to a contradiction. This forces $\\omega=0$, proving that $b_1(M) = \\dim \\mathcal{H}^1(M) = 0$.\n\nFor $p=2$, the curvature operator $\\mathcal{R}_2$ is more complex and is not determined solely by the Ricci tensor. We now analyze each option based on these principles.\n\n**A. $M=S^2\\times S^2$ with the product of the round metrics of constant sectional curvature $1$. Then $\\operatorname{Ric}_g>0$ everywhere, and there are nonzero harmonic $2$-forms, for example the pullbacks of the volume forms from each factor.**\n\nLet $(S^2, g_0)$ be the $2$-sphere with the round metric of constant sectional curvature $K=1$. The Ricci tensor of an $n$-manifold with constant sectional curvature $K$ is $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1)K g$. For $S^2$, $n=2$, so $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_0} = (2-1)(1)g_0 = g_0$. This is positive definite.\nLet $M = S^2 \\times S^2$ with the product metric $g$. The Ricci tensor of the product is the direct sum of the Ricci tensors of the factors. For any tangent vector $v = (v_1, v_2) \\in T_{(p_1,p_2)}M \\cong T_{p_1}S^2 \\oplus T_{p_2}S^2$, we have $\\operatorname{Ric}_g(v,v) = \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_0}(v_1,v_1) + \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_0}(v_2,v_2) = g_0(v_1,v_1) + g_0(v_2,v_2) = |v_1|^2 + |v_2|^2 = |v|^2$. Since $\\operatorname{Ric}_g=g$, it is positive definite. Thus, $\\operatorname{Ric}_g > 0$ everywhere is correct.\n\nBy the Hodge theorem, the existence of nonzero harmonic $2$-forms is equivalent to the second Betti number $b_2(M)$ being nonzero. We use the Künneth formula for de Rham cohomology:\n$$ H^2(S^2 \\times S^2; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{i+j=2} H^i(S^2; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H^j(S^2; \\mathbb{R}) $$\nThe cohomology of $S^2$ is $H^0(S^2; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, $H^1(S^2; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$, and $H^2(S^2; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe terms are:\n- $(i,j)=(0,2)$: $H^0(S^2) \\otimes H^2(S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\otimes \\mathbb{R} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$\n- $(i,j)=(1,1)$: $H^1(S^2) \\otimes H^1(S^2) \\cong 0 \\otimes 0 = 0$\n- $(i,j)=(2,0)$: $H^2(S^2) \\otimes H^0(S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\otimes \\mathbb{R} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$\nThus, $H^2(S^2 \\times S^2; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\oplus \\mathbb{R}$, and $b_2(S^2 \\times S^2) = 2$.\nThis confirms the existence of two linearly independent harmonic $2$-forms. These forms are indeed given by $\\pi_1^*\\omega_0$ and $\\pi_2^*\\omega_0$, where $\\omega_0$ is the volume form of $(S^2, g_0)$ and $\\pi_1, \\pi_2$ are the projections.\nThis option correctly provides a counterexample to the idea that $\\operatorname{Ric}_g > 0$ forces all harmonic $2$-forms to vanish.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $M=\\mathbb{CP}^2$ with the Fubini–Study metric. Then $\\operatorname{Ric}_g>0$, and there is a nontrivial harmonic $2$-form, namely the Kähler form.**\n\nLet $M = \\mathbb{CP}^n$ be complex projective space with the Fubini-Study metric $g_{FS}$. This is a compact Kähler manifold. For a proper normalization of the metric, $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is an Einstein manifold with $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{FS}} = \\lambda g_{FS}$ for a positive constant $\\lambda = n+1$. For $n=2$, we have $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ and $\\operatorname{Ric}_g = 3g$. This is positive definite, so the claim $\\operatorname{Ric}_g > 0$ is correct.\nOn any compact Kähler manifold, the Kähler form $\\omega$ is harmonic. This is because it is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection ($\\nabla\\omega=0$), which implies it is both closed ($d\\omega=0$) and coclosed ($\\delta\\omega=0$), and thus harmonic ($\\Delta_H \\omega = 0$).\nTo see if this harmonic form is nontrivial, we check the cohomology. The cohomology ring of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is $H^*(\\mathbb{CP}^n; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x] / (x^{n+1})$ where $x$ is a generator of degree $2$. For $n=2$, $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^2; \\mathbb{R})$ is one-dimensional, generated by the cohomology class of the Kähler form $[\\omega]$. Since $b_2(\\mathbb{CP}^2)=1$, there exists exactly one (up to scaling) nonzero harmonic $2$-form. The Kähler form is this form.\nThis option provides another valid counterexample.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. If $\\operatorname{Ric}_g>0$ on a compact oriented manifold, then every harmonic $2$-form must vanish.**\n\nThis statement is a general assertion. Options A and B provide explicit counterexamples. Both $S^2 \\times S^2$ and $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ are compact, oriented manifolds with metrics of strictly positive Ricci curvature, yet they both support nonzero harmonic $2$-forms. Therefore, the assertion is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A sufficient curvature condition ensuring that all harmonic $2$-forms vanish on a compact manifold is positivity of the full curvature operator acting on $2$-forms.**\n\nThis statement refers to the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula for a harmonic $2$-form $\\omega$:\n$$ 0 = \\int_M |\\nabla \\omega|^2 \\, dV_g + \\int_M \\langle \\mathcal{R}_2(\\omega), \\omega \\rangle \\, dV_g $$\nThe condition \"positivity of the full curvature operator acting on $2$-forms\" means that at every point $x \\in M$, the quadratic form $\\eta \\mapsto \\langle \\mathcal{R}_2(\\eta), \\eta \\rangle_x$ is positive definite on the space of $2$-forms $\\Lambda^2 T_x^*M$.\nIf this condition holds, then for any non-zero $2$-form $\\omega$, the integrand $\\langle \\mathcal{R}_2(\\omega), \\omega \\rangle$ is non-negative everywhere and strictly positive at any point where $\\omega_x \\neq 0$. If $\\omega$ is not identically zero, then $\\int_M \\langle \\mathcal{R}_2(\\omega), \\omega \\rangle \\, dV_g > 0$.\nThe term $\\int_M |\\nabla \\omega|^2 \\, dV_g$ is always non-negative. The sum of a strictly positive number and a non-negative number cannot be zero. The only way for the identity to hold is if $\\omega$ is identically zero everywhere.\nThus, positivity of the curvature operator on $2$-forms is indeed a sufficient condition for the vanishing of all harmonic $2$-forms. This is a classic result from the Bochner technique, sometimes associated with the work of Gallot and Meyer.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. $M=S^2\\times S^1$ with the product of the round metrics. Then $\\operatorname{Ric}_g>0$ everywhere, and there is a nonzero harmonic $2$-form, for example the pullback of the volume form from $S^2$.**\n\nLet $M=S^2 \\times S^1$ with the product metric $g$. Let $g_1$ be the round metric on $S^2$ (say, with $K=1$) and $g_2$ be the standard flat metric on $S^1$.\nAs established in A, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_1} > 0$. The circle $S^1$ is a flat manifold, so its Ricci curvature is zero: $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_2} = 0$.\nThe Ricci tensor of the product is $\\operatorname{Ric}_g = \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_1} \\oplus \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_2}$. For a tangent vector $v = (v_1, v_2)$ with $v_1 \\in T_{p_1}S^2$ and $v_2 \\in T_{p_2}S^1$, we have $\\operatorname{Ric}_g(v,v) = \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_1}(v_1,v_1) + \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_2}(v_2,v_2) = \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_1}(v_1,v_1) \\geq 0$.\nHowever, if we choose a non-zero vector $v$ tangent to the $S^1$ factor (i.e., $v_1=0$, $v_2 \\neq 0$), then $\\operatorname{Ric}_g(v,v) = 0$. This means the Ricci curvature is only positive semi-definite, not positive definite. The statement \"$\\operatorname{Ric}_g>0$ everywhere\" is false.\nFor completeness, let's check for harmonic $2$-forms. Using the Künneth formula for $H^2(S^2 \\times S^1; \\mathbb{R})$:\nThe cohomology of $S^1$ is $H^0(S^1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, $H^1(S^1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe terms for $i+j=2$ are:\n- $(i,j)=(1,1)$: $H^1(S^2) \\otimes H^1(S^1) \\cong 0 \\otimes \\mathbb{R} = 0$\n- $(i,j)=(2,0)$: $H^2(S^2) \\otimes H^0(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\otimes \\mathbb{R} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$\nSo $H^2(S^2 \\times S^1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, and $b_2(M)=1$. A nonzero harmonic $2$-form does exist.\nHowever, because the premise $\\operatorname{Ric}_g > 0$ is false, the option as a whole is incorrect as it fails to identify a situation with this property.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "3079748"}, {"introduction": "The power of the Bochner method extends beyond differential forms into the realm of spectral geometry.

The integral of the left-hand side vanishes by the divergence theorem, yielding:\n$$\n0 = \\int_M \\left( |\\nabla^2 f|^2 + \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla(-\\mu f) \\rangle + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla f, \\nabla f) \\right) \\, dV\n$$\nSubstituting $\\nabla(-\\mu f) = -\\mu \\nabla f$, the identity becomes:\n$$\n0 = \\int_M \\left( |\\nabla^2 f|^2 - \\mu |\\nabla f|^2 + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla f, \\nabla f) \\right) \\, dV\n$$\nWe rearrange this to:\n$$\n\\int_M \\left( \\mu |\\nabla f|^2 - \\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla f, \\nabla f) \\right) \\, dV = \\int_M |\\nabla^2 f|^2 \\, dV\n$$\nNow we introduce two key inequalities. First, assume a uniform lower bound for the Ricci curvature, $\\operatorname{Ric}(X, X) \\ge K |X|^2$ for some constant $K$. Applying this to $X = \\nabla f$ gives $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla f, \\nabla f) \\ge K |\\nabla f|^2$. This implies:\n$$\n\\int_M (\\mu - K) |\\nabla f|^2 \\, dV \\ge \\int_M |\\nabla^2 f|^2 \\, dV\n$$\nSecond, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $|\\nabla^2 f|^2 \\ge \\frac{1}{n} (\\operatorname{tr}(\\nabla^2 f))^2$. Since $\\operatorname{tr}(\\nabla^2 f) = \\Delta f = -\\mu f$, we have $|\\nabla^2 f|^2 \\ge \\frac{1}{n}(-\\mu f)^2 = \\frac{\\mu^2}{n} f^2$. Substituting this into our main inequality gives:\n$$\n\\int_M (\\mu - K) |\\nabla f|^2 \\, dV \\ge \\int_M \\frac{\\mu^2}{n} f^2 \\, dV\n$$\nTo relate the two integrals, we use Green's first identity (integration by parts): $\\int_M |\\nabla f|^2 \\, dV = -\\int_M f \\Delta f \\, dV = -\\int_M f(-\\mu f) \\, dV = \\mu \\int_M f^2 \\, dV$. Substituting this relation:\n$$\n(\\mu - K) \\left( \\mu \\int_M f^2 \\, dV \\right) \\ge \\frac{\\mu^2}{n} \\int_M f^2 \\, dV\n$$\nSince $f$ is not identically zero and $\\mu > 0$, we can divide by the positive quantity $\\mu \\int_M f^2 \\, dV$:\n$$\n\\mu - K \\ge \\frac{\\mu}{n}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu - \\frac{\\mu}{n} \\ge K \\implies \\mu \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\ge K \\implies \\mu \\left(\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right) \\ge K\n$$\nThis implies that any positive eigenvalue $\\mu$ must satisfy $\\mu \\ge K \\frac{n}{n-1}$. This holds in particular for the smallest positive eigenvalue, $\\mu_1$.\n\nNow, we specialize this bound to the case of the standard flat $n$-torus, $T^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The metric on $T^n$ is flat, which means the Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. Consequently, the Ricci curvature tensor is also identically zero, $\\operatorname{Ric} = 0$. We can therefore take the lower bound constant $K=0$. Substituting $K=0$ into the Lichnerowicz bound, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mu_1 \\ge 0 \\cdot \\frac{n}{n-1} \\implies \\mu_1 \\ge 0\n$$\nThis bound is correct but not informative. We already know that the eigenvalues of $-\\Delta$ on a compact manifold are non-negative, and $\\mu_1$ is defined as the smallest *positive* eigenvalue. The Bochner method, in this case, does not provide a sharp estimate.\n\nTo find the actual value of $\\mu_1$, we compute the spectrum of $-\\Delta$ on $T^n$ directly. A function on $T^n$ can be identified with a function on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ that is periodic with period $1$ in each coordinate. The Laplace-Beltrami operator in these standard coordinates is just the ordinary Euclidean Laplacian, $\\Delta = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_j^2}$. The eigenvalue problem is $-\\Delta f = \\mu f$ for a $1$-periodic function $f$.\nThe set of functions $\\{ \\exp(i 2\\pi \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) \\}_{\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n}$, where $\\mathbf{k}=(k_1, \\dots, k_n)$ is a vector of integers and $\\mathbf{x}=(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, forms a complete orthogonal basis for $L^2(T^n)$. We apply the operator $-\\Delta$ to these basis functions:\n$$\n-\\Delta \\exp(i 2\\pi \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) = - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_j^2} \\exp\\left(i 2\\pi \\sum_{l=1}^{n} k_l x_l\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (i 2\\pi k_j)^2 \\exp(i 2\\pi \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x})\n$$\n$$\n= - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (-4\\pi^2 k_j^2) \\exp(i 2\\pi \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x})\n$$\n$$\n= \\left( 4\\pi^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k_j^2 \\right) \\exp(i 2\\pi \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) = 4\\pi^2 |\\mathbf{k}|^2 \\exp(i 2\\pi \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x})\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\mu$ of $-\\Delta$ are thus given by the numbers $\\mu_{\\mathbf{k}} = 4\\pi^2 |\\mathbf{k}|^2 = 4\\pi^2 (k_1^2 + k_2^2 + \\dots + k_n^2)$ for all $\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$.\n\nWe seek the smallest positive eigenvalue, $\\mu_1$. The eigenvalues are non-negative.\nFor $\\mathbf{k} = (0, \\dots, 0)$, we get the eigenvalue $\\mu_0 = 0$, which corresponds to constant functions.\nTo find the smallest positive eigenvalue, we must find the minimum non-zero value of the sum $\\sum_{j=1}^n k_j^2$, where $k_j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Since the $k_j$ are integers, $k_j^2$ is a non-negative integer. The smallest non-zero value of this sum is achieved when exactly one $k_j$ is $\\pm 1$ and all other $k_l$ are $0$. For such a vector $\\mathbf{k}$, $|\\mathbf{k}|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\nThe minimum non-zero value of $|\\mathbf{k}|^2$ for $\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ is $1$.\nTherefore, the smallest positive eigenvalue $\\mu_1$ is:\n$$\n\\mu_1 = 4\\pi^2 \\cdot \\min_{\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{\\mathbf{0}\\}} |\\mathbf{k}|^2 = 4\\pi^2 \\cdot 1 = 4\\pi^2\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4\\pi^2}$$", "id": "3079766"}]}
