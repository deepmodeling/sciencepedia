This is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients, and we solve it by splitting into cases for $\\lambda$.\n\nCase 1: $\\lambda=0$. The differential equation becomes $-f''(\\theta)=0$, so $f''(\\theta)=0$. Integrating twice yields $f(\\theta)=A\\theta+B$ for constants $A$ and $B$. The periodicity $f(\\theta+2\\pi)=f(\\theta)$ implies $A(\\theta+2\\pi)+B=A\\theta+B$, hence $2\\pi A=0$ and therefore $A=0$. Thus $f(\\theta)=B$ is constant.

Theta Series Coincidence:** The heat trace of a manifold, $\\Theta(t) = \\sum_j e^{-\\lambda_j t}$, is a spectral invariant; two manifolds are isospectral if and only if their heat traces are identical for all $t > 0$. For the torus $T_i$, the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{i,m} = 4\\pi^2 (m^\\top G_i^{-1} m)$ for $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$.
