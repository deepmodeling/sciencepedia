The Riemannian metric $g$ is given in these coordinates by the components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The function is $f: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x^{i})^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the gradient of $f$, denoted $\\nabla f$. The gradient is the unique vector field such that for any vector field $X$, we have $g(\\nabla f, X) = df(X)$, where $df$ is the differential of $f$.\n\nThe differential $df$ is given by $df = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} dx^{j}$.

We use the defining relation with the basis vector fields $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}$:\n$$\ng\\left(\\nabla f, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right) = df\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right)\n$$\nThe left-hand side is:\n$$\ng\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (\\nabla f)^{k} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (\\nabla f)^{k} g_{ki} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (\\nabla f)^{k} \\delta_{ki} = (\\nabla f)^{i}\n$$\nThe right-hand side is:\n$$\ndf\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right) = \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} 2x^{j} dx^{j} \\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} 2x^{j} \\delta^{j}_{i} = 2x^{i}\n$$\nEquating the two sides gives the components of the gradient: $(\\nabla f)^{i} = 2x^{i}$.\nThe gradient vector field is therefore $\\nabla f = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2x^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}$.\n\nNext, we compute the Laplacian of $f$, $\\Delta f$, which is defined as the divergence of the gradient, $\\Delta f = \\operatorname{div}(\\nabla f)$. The divergence of a vector field $X = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}$ is given in general local coordinates by the formula:\n$$\n\\operatorname{div}(X) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\det(g)} X^{i} \\right)\n$$\nFor the standard Euclidean metric, the matrix of components is the identity matrix, so $\\det(g) = 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\operatorname{div}(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial X^{i}}{\\partial x^{i}}\n$$\nApplying this to our gradient field $\\nabla f$, whose components are $(\\nabla f)^{i} = 2x^{i}$:\n$$\n\\Delta f = \\operatorname{div}(\\nabla f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}(2x^{i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2\n$$\nSumming the constant $2$ over the $n$ indices yields:\n$$\n\\Delta f = 2n\n$$\nThis is the Laplacian of the function $f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x^{i})^{2}$.\n\nNow, we interpret this result in terms of the trace of the Hessian of $f$. The Hessian of a smooth function $f$, denoted $\\operatorname{Hess}(f)$, is the $(0,2)$-tensor field defined by $\\operatorname{Hess}(f)(X,Y) = g(\\nabla_X \\nabla f, Y)$, where $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection. The Laplacian can be defined equivalently as the trace of the Hessian: $\\Delta f = \\operatorname{tr}_{g}(\\operatorname{Hess}(f))$.\n\nThe components of the Hessian in a local coordinate system are given by:\n$$\n(\\operatorname{Hess}(f))_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x^{i}\\partial x^{j}} - \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\Gamma^{k}_{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{k}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the connection. For the standard Euclidean metric in Cartesian coordinates, all Christoffel symbols are zero: $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij} = 0$.\nThus, the Hessian components simplify to the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n$$\n(\\operatorname{Hess}(f))_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x^{i}\\partial x^{j}}\n$$\nWe have $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} = 2x^{j}$. The second partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x^{i}\\partial x^{j}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}(2x^{j}) = 2\\delta_{ij}\n$$\nSo, the Hessian components are $(\\operatorname{Hess}(f))_{ij} = 2\\delta_{ij}$.\n\nThe trace of the Hessian is $\\operatorname{tr}_{g}(\\operatorname{Hess}(f)) = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} g^{ij}(\\operatorname{Hess}(f))_{ij}$. The components of the inverse metric $g^{ij}$ are also given by the Kronecker delta, $g^{ij} = \\delta^{ij}$.\n$$\n\\Delta f = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\delta^{ij} (2\\delta_{ij})\n$$\nThe term $\\delta^{ij}$ is non-zero only when $i=j$. So, we can set $j=i$:\n$$\n\\Delta f = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\delta^{ii} (2\\delta_{ii}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1)(2 \\cdot 1) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 = 2n\n$$\nThis calculation confirms that the Laplacian of $f$ is indeed the trace of its Hessian, and the value is $2n$. In matrix form, $\\operatorname{Hess}(f)$ is $2$ times the identity matrix, and its trace is the sum of its diagonal elements, which is $2n$.\n\nFinally, we consider the connection to the Omori-Yau maximum principle. The principle, in one of its forms, applies to a smooth function $u$ that is bounded from above on a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below. It asserts the existence of a sequence of points $\\{p_k\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ in $M$ such that $u(p_k) \\to \\sup_M u$, $\\|\\nabla u(p_k)\\| \\to 0$, and $\\limsup_{k \\to \\infty} \\Delta u(p_k) \\leq 0$.\nOur function $f(x) = r(x)^2$ is not bounded above. However, it is a quintessential example of a smooth, proper exhaustion function on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which is the model space for complete, non-compact manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature (in this case, Ricci curvature is identically zero).\nThe calculation $\\Delta f = 2n > 0$ shows that $f$ is a strictly subharmonic function. The maximum principle for elliptic operators states that a non-constant subharmonic function cannot attain a local maximum in the interior of its domain.\nIf we consider the function $u(x) = -f(x) = -r(x)^2$, this function is bounded above by $0$ and attains its maximum at the origin $x=0$. At the maximum point $p=0$, we have $\\nabla u(p) = -\\nabla f(0) = 0$ and $\\Delta u(p) = -\\Delta f(0) = -2n  0$. This is consistent with the conclusion of the classical maximum principle on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nThe Omori-Yau principle generalizes this to manifolds where a maximum may not be attained. The calculation for $f=r^2$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ serves as a foundational model for the Laplacian comparison theorems (e.g., Bochner's formula) that underpin the proof of the Omori-Yau principle on general manifolds. The fact that the Hessian of the squared distance function is a multiple of the metric ($\\operatorname{Hess}(r^2) = 2g$) and its Laplacian is a positive constant ($\\Delta(r^2) = 2n$) on flat space provides the benchmark against which the effects of curvature are measured in more general settings.

A Riemannian manifold is complete if and only if it is complete as a metric space under the distance function induced by the metric. For the manifold $M=(0,1)$ with the metric $g$ induced from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}$, the distance between any two points $x, y \\in M$ is $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. To demonstrate that $(M,g)$ is not complete, we need to exhibit a Cauchy sequence of points in $M$ that does not converge to a limit point within $M$.\n\nConsider the sequence $\\{x_k\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ defined by $x_k = 1 - \\frac{1}{k+1}$. For every integer $k \\ge 1$, we have $0  x_k  1$, so each term of the sequence is in $M$. This sequence is a Cauchy sequence. To see this, for any $\\epsilon  0$, let $m  k$. Then the distance is $d(x_m, x_k) = |(1 - \\frac{1}{m+1}) - (1 - \\frac{1}{k+1})| = |\\frac{1}{k+1} - \\frac{1}{m+1}|  \\frac{1}{k+1}$. By choosing an integer $N  1/\\epsilon - 1$, for all $kN$ we have $1/(k+1)  \\epsilon$, which confirms the Cauchy property. The limit of this sequence in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} x_k = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} (1 - \\frac{1}{k+1}) = 1$. However, the point $1$ is not an element of the open interval $M=(0,1)$. Since we have found a Cauchy sequence in $M$ whose limit point is not in $M$, the manifold $(M,g)$ is not complete.\n\nSecond, we analyze the properties of the function $f(x) = x$ on $M=(0,1)$. The function maps the interval $(0,1)$ to itself. For any $x \\in M$, we have $0  f(x)  1$. This shows that $f$ is bounded on $M$. The supremum of $f$ on $M$ is $\\sup_{x \\in (0,1)} f(x) = \\sup_{x \\in (0,1)} x = 1$. The function $f(x)=x$ is infinitely differentiable on all of $\\mathbb{R}$. Its first and second derivatives are $f'(x)=1$ and $f''(x)=0$, respectively. Both derivatives are constant functions and are therefore continuous on $M=(0,1)$. Thus, $f$ is of class $C^{\\infty}(M)$, which implies $f \\in C^2(M)$.\n\nThird, we compute the exact value of $I$.

On the one-dimensional manifold $M=(0,1)$, we use the standard coordinate $x$. The Riemannian metric $g$ is given by its single component $g_{11}=1$. The inverse metric is $g^{11}=1$. The components of the gradient of a function $f$ in local coordinates are given by $(\\nabla f)^i = g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j}$. In this case, with $i=j=1$:\n$$ (\\nabla f)^1 = g^{11} \\frac{df}{dx} = (1)(1) = 1. $$\nThe gradient vector field is $\\nabla f = 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. The squared norm of the gradient at a point $x$ is $|\\nabla f|^2(x) = g_x(\\nabla f, \\nabla f) = g_{11}(x) ((\\nabla f)^1)^2$. This gives:\n$$ |\\nabla f|^2(x) = (1)(1)^2 = 1. $$\nThus, the norm of the gradient is $|\\nabla f|(x) = \\sqrt{1} = 1$ for all $x \\in M$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the set over which the infimum is taken. The sequences $\\{x_k\\}$ are required to be in $M=(0,1)$ and to satisfy $f(x_k) \\to \\sup_M f$. As established, $\\sup_M f = 1$, so the condition on the sequence is $x_k \\to 1$ as $k \\to \\infty$. Let $\\{x_k\\}$ be any such sequence. We must compute the corresponding value $\\liminf_{k\\to\\infty} |\\nabla f|(x_k)$. Since $|\\nabla f|(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in M$, we have $|\\nabla f|(x_k) = 1$ for every term in the sequence. The sequence of values $\\{|\\nabla f|(x_k)\\}_{k=1}^\\infty$ is the constant sequence $\\{1, 1, 1, \\dots\\}$. The limit inferior of a constant sequence is the constant value itself:\n$$ \\liminf_{k\\to\\infty} |\\nabla f|(x_k) = \\liminf_{k\\to\\infty} 1 = 1. $$\nThis result is the same for every sequence $\\{x_k\\}$ that satisfies the condition $x_k \\to 1$. Therefore, the set in the definition of $I$ is the singleton set $\\{1\\}$. The infimum of this set is:\n$$ I = \\inf\\{1\\} = 1. $$\nThis result, $I=1$, quantitatively demonstrates the failure of the Omori-Yau maximum principle for the function $f$ on the incomplete manifold $M$.

Since exponential decay is faster than any polynomial growth, this limit is $0$.\n    Because $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} k \\cdot \\Delta u(p_k) = 0$, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $K$ such that for all $k > K$, we have $k \\cdot \\Delta u(p_k)  \\epsilon$. Choosing $\\epsilon = 1$, we get $k \\cdot \\Delta u(p_k)  1$, which implies $\\Delta u(p_k)  \\frac{1}{k}$. Since $\\Delta u(p_k) \\ge 0$ for $m \\ge 2$, we have $\\Delta u(p_k) \\leq \\frac{1}{k}$ for sufficiently large $k$.\n    Thus, for both cases $m=2$ and $m>2$, the condition $\\Delta u(p_k) \\leq \\frac{1}{k}$ is met for sufficiently large $k$. The sequence $\\{p_k\\}$ is indeed an Omori sequence for $u$.\n\n(d) Computation of the limit.\n\nWe are asked to compute the limit $L = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\Delta u(p_k)}{|\\nabla u|(p_k)}$. Using the expressions derived in part (a) and evaluated at the points $p_k=(k, \\theta_0)$ from part (c):\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta u(p_k)}{|\\nabla u|(p_k)} = \\frac{(m-2) \\frac{\\sinh k}{\\cosh^3 k}}{\\operatorname{sech}^2 k} = \\frac{(m-2) \\frac{\\sinh k}{\\cosh^3 k}}{\\frac{1}{\\cosh^2 k}}.\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta u(p_k)}{|\\nabla u|(p_k)} = (m-2) \\frac{\\sinh k}{\\cosh^3 k} \\cdot \\cosh^2 k = (m-2) \\frac{\\sinh k}{\\cosh k} = (m-2) \\tanh k.\n$$\nNow, we take the limit as $k \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} (m-2) \\tanh k = (m-2) \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\tanh k.\n$$\nSince $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\tanh k = 1$, the limit is:\n$$\nL = (m-2) \\cdot 1 = m-2.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{m-2}$$", "id": "3075426"}]}
