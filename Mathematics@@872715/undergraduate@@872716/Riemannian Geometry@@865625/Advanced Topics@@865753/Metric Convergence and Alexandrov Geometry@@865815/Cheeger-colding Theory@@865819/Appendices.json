In Euclidean space, any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is equivalent. A geodesic ball $B_{p}(r)$ is a standard Euclidean ball of radius $r$. The volume of such a ball is given by the formula $\\operatorname{Vol}(B_{p}(r)) = \\omega_{n} r^{n}$, where $\\omega_{n}$ is precisely the volume of the unit ball in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Substituting this into the definition of the volume ratio, we get:\n$$\nf_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(p,r) = \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_{p}(r))}{\\omega_{n}\\, r^{n}} = \\frac{\\omega_{n}\\, r^{n}}{\\omega_{n}\\, r^{n}} = 1.\n$$\nThus, for Euclidean space, the volume ratio is constant and equal to $1$, independent of the center $p$ and the radius $r$.\n\nNext, we consider a general complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M^{n},g)$ satisfying the condition of non-negative Ricci curvature, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$. To analyze the volume ratio $f_{M}(p,r)$ on such a manifold, we invoke the Bishop–Gromov volume comparison theorem. A version of this theorem states that if $(M^{n},g)$ is a complete Riemannian manifold with $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)k g$ for some constant $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then for any $p \\in M$, the function\n$$\nr \\mapsto \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_p(r))}{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_{p_k}(r))}\n$$\nis non-increasing for $r > 0$. Here, $B_{p_k}(r)$ denotes a geodesic ball of radius $r$ in the simply connected $n$-dimensional space form of constant sectional curvature $k$.\n\nIn our specific problem, the condition is $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$. This corresponds to the case $k=0$. The simply connected $n$-dimensional space form of constant sectional curvature $k=0$ is the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The volume of a geodesic ball of radius $r$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is, as established earlier, $\\operatorname{Vol}(B_{p_0}(r)) = \\omega_{n} r^{n}$. Therefore, for a manifold $(M^n, g)$ with $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$, the Bishop–Gromov theorem implies that the function\n$$\nr \\mapsto \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_p(r))}{\\omega_{n} r^{n}} = f_{M}(p,r)\n$$\nis a non-increasing function of the radius $r$ for any fixed point $p \\in M$.\n\nSince $f_{M}(p,r)$ is a non-increasing function for $r \\in (0, \\infty)$, its value is bounded above by its limit as $r$ approaches $0$ from the right. That is, for any $r > 0$:\n$$\nf_{M}(p,r) \\le \\lim_{s \\to 0^+} f_{M}(p,s).\n$$\nWe must now compute this limit. The problem statement directs us to use the local Euclidean approximation in normal coordinates. At any point $p \\in M$, we can introduce a system of normal coordinates centered at $p$. In these coordinates, the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ at a point with coordinates $x = (x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ can be expressed via a Taylor expansion around the origin $x=0$ (which corresponds to $p$). The expansion begins as $g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij} + O(|x|^2)$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, representing the Euclidean metric. The volume element $dV_g$ is related to the Euclidean volume element $d^n x$ by $dV_g = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij}(x))} \\, d^n x$.\n\nAs $r \\to 0$, we are considering the volume of an infinitesimally small geodesic ball $B_p(r)$. In the limit, the manifold's geometry at $p$ is indistinguishable from that of its tangent space $T_p M$, which is isometric to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. More formally, the limit of the volume ratio is:\n$$\n\\lim_{r \\to 0^+} f_{M}(p,r) = \\lim_{r \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_{p}(r))}{\\omega_{n}\\, r^{n}}.\n$$\nIn normal coordinates, $\\operatorname{Vol}(B_p(r))$ is the integral of $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij}(x))}$ over the Euclidean ball $B_0(r)$ in the coordinate chart.\n$$\n\\lim_{r \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\int_{B_0(r) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij}(x))} \\, d^nx}{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_0(r))}\n$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{Vol}(B_0(r)) = \\omega_n r^n$. This limit is the value of the integrand $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij}(x))}$ at the point $x=0$, which is $p$. Since $g_{ij}(0) = \\delta_{ij}$, we have $\\det(g_{ij}(0)) = \\det(\\delta_{ij}) = 1$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\lim_{s \\to 0^+} f_{M}(p,s) = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij}(0))} = 1.\n$$\nCombining our findings, for a complete manifold $(M^n,g)$ with $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$, we have for any $p \\in M$ and any $r>0$:\n$$\nf_{M}(p,r) \\le 1.\n$$\nThis establishes $1$ as a universal upper bound, independent of the point $p$ and the radius $r$.\n\nFinally, we must check if this bound is sharp. A bound is sharp if there exists a case where it is attained. As we computed at the beginning, for the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (which is a complete manifold with $\\operatorname{Ric} = 0$, thus satisfying the hypothesis), we have $f_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(p,r) = 1$ for all $p$ and $r$. Since the equality is achieved, the bound is sharp.\n\nThe sharp universal upper bound for $f_{M}(p,r)$ is therefore $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3039748"}, {"introduction": "Gromov-Hausdorff convergence provides a powerful lens through which to study the limits of sequences of Riemannian manifolds.

The squared norms under the two metrics are:\n$$ |v|_{0}^{2} = g_{0}(v,v) = |v_r|^2 + r^2 g_{S^{n-1}}(v_S/r, v_S/r) $$\n$$ |v|_{\\epsilon}^{2} = g_{\\epsilon}(v,v) = |v_r|^2 + (1+\\epsilon)^2 r^2 g_{S^{n-1}}(v_S/r, v_S/r) $$\nLet $|v_S|_0^2 = r^2 g_{S^{n-1}}(v_S/r, v_S/r)$. Then $|v|_{\\epsilon}^{2} = |v_r|^2 + (1+\\epsilon)^2 |v_S|_0^2$.\nSince $\\epsilon \\geq 0$, we have $(1+\\epsilon)^2 \\geq 1$. This leads to the pointwise vector norm inequality:\n$$ |v|_{0}^{2} = |v_r|^2 + |v_S|_0^2 \\leq |v_r|^2 + (1+\\epsilon)^2 |v_S|_0^2 = |v|_{\\epsilon}^{2} $$\nFurthermore, since $|v_S|_0^2 \\leq |v_r|^2 + |v_S|_0^2 = |v|_0^2$, we have:\n$$ |v|_{\\epsilon}^{2} = |v|_0^2 - |v_S|_0^2 + (1+\\epsilon)^2 |v_S|_0^2 = |v|_0^2 + ((1+\\epsilon)^2-1)|v_S|_0^2 \\leq |v|_0^2 + ((1+\\epsilon)^2-1)|v|_0^2 = (1+\\epsilon)^2 |v|_0^2 $$\nTaking the square root gives the relation between vector norms: $|v|_{0} \\leq |v|_{\\epsilon} \\leq (1+\\epsilon)|v|_{0}$.\n\nThe length of any curve $\\gamma$ is obtained by integrating the norm of its tangent vector. This inequality on norms translates directly to an inequality on curve lengths, $L_0(\\gamma) \\leq L_{\\epsilon}(\\gamma) \\leq (1+\\epsilon)L_0(\\gamma)$. The distance $d(p,q)$ is the infimum of the lengths of all curves connecting $p$ and $q$. Therefore, we have the following inequality for the distance functions:\n$$ d_{0}(p,q) \\leq d_{\\epsilon}(p,q) \\leq (1+\\epsilon) d_{0}(p,q) $$\nThis means the identity map $id: (B(\\rho), d_0) \\to (B(\\rho), d_\\epsilon)$ is $(1+\\epsilon)$-Lipschitz, and its inverse is $1$-Lipschitz. Thus, the identity map between the two spaces is bi-Lipschitz with constant $L=1+\\epsilon$. This constant is sharp, as the ratio of distances is exactly $1+\\epsilon$ for any two distinct points on a sphere centered at the origin.\n\nApplying the given Gromov–Hausdorff distance bound with $X = B_{\\epsilon}(o,\\rho)$, $Y = B_{0}(o,\\rho)$, $L=1+\\epsilon$, and $\\operatorname{rad}(Y) = \\rho$:\n$$ d_{\\mathrm{GH}}(B_{\\epsilon}(o,\\rho), B_{0}(o,\\rho)) \\leq (L-1)\\operatorname{rad}(Y) = ((1+\\epsilon)-1)\\rho = \\epsilon \\rho $$\nThis provides an upper bound in terms of $\\epsilon$ and $\\rho$. The problem requires the final answer to be expressed in terms of $n$, $\\rho$, and the volume ratio $V_R = \\operatorname{Vol}_{\\epsilon}(B_{\\epsilon}(o,\\rho)) / (\\omega_{n} \\rho^{n})$. We must now find the relationship between $\\epsilon$ and $V_R$.\n\nThe volume element for the metric $g_{\\epsilon}$ is derived from the warped product structure. The warping function is $f(r)=(1+\\epsilon)r$. The volume form is $dV_{\\epsilon} = f(r)^{n-1} dr \\wedge dV_{S^{n-1}}$.\nThe volume of the ball $B_{\\epsilon}(o,\\rho)$ is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Vol}_{\\epsilon}(B_{\\epsilon}(o,\\rho)) = \\int_{0}^{\\rho} \\int_{S^{n-1}} ((1+\\epsilon)r)^{n-1} dV_{S^{n-1}} dr $$\n$$ = (1+\\epsilon)^{n-1} \\operatorname{Vol}(S^{n-1}) \\int_{0}^{\\rho} r^{n-1} dr = (1+\\epsilon)^{n-1} \\operatorname{Vol}(S^{n-1}) \\frac{\\rho^n}{n} $$\nThe volume of the unit Euclidean ball in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\omega_n$, is given by $\\omega_n = \\operatorname{Vol}(S^{n-1}) \\frac{1^n}{n} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}(S^{n-1})}{n}$.\nSubstituting $\\operatorname{Vol}(S^{n-1}) = n\\omega_n$ into the expression for the volume of $B_{\\epsilon}(o,\\rho)$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Vol}_{\\epsilon}(B_{\\epsilon}(o,\\rho)) = (1+\\epsilon)^{n-1} (n\\omega_n) \\frac{\\rho^n}{n} = (1+\\epsilon)^{n-1} \\omega_n \\rho^n $$\nNow we form the volume ratio $V_R$:\n$$ V_R = \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}_{\\epsilon}(B_{\\epsilon}(o,\\rho))}{\\omega_{n} \\rho^{n}} = \\frac{(1+\\epsilon)^{n-1} \\omega_n \\rho^n}{\\omega_n \\rho^n} = (1+\\epsilon)^{n-1} $$\nSolving this equation for $\\epsilon$ yields:\n$$ \\epsilon = (V_R)^{\\frac{1}{n-1}} - 1 = \\left( \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}_{\\epsilon}(B_{\\epsilon}(o,\\rho))}{\\omega_{n} \\rho^{n}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n-1}} - 1 $$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $\\epsilon$ back into our upper bound for the Gromov–Hausdorff distance, $\\epsilon \\rho$:\n$$ \\text{Upper Bound} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}_{\\epsilon}(B_{\\epsilon}(o,\\rho))}{\\omega_{n} \\rho^{n}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n-1}} - 1 \\right) \\rho $$\nThis expression is the explicit sharp upper bound derived using the provided tools and constraints, expressed purely in terms of the required quantities.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\rho \\left( \\left( \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}_{\\epsilon}(B_{\\epsilon}(o,\\rho))}{\\omega_{n} \\rho^{n}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n-1}} - 1 \\right)}\n$$", "id": "3039764"}]}
