The Gromov-Hausdorff distance $d_{GH}(X,Y)$ between compact metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ is defined as the infimum, over all isometric embeddings of $X$ and $Y$ into a common metric space $Z$, of the Hausdorff distance $d_{H}^{Z}(\\varphi(X),\\psi(Y))$ between the images.

Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that $a \\le b$. Our goal is to find an expression for the distance under this assumption, which can then be generalized.\n\nWe will establish the value of $d_{GH}(X,Y)$ by finding matching upper and lower bounds.\n\nFirst, to establish an upper bound, we construct specific isometric embeddings of $X$ and $Y$ into a common metric space and compute the Hausdorff distance between their images. Let the common metric space be $(\\mathbb{R}, d_{\\mathbb{R}})$.\nLet's define the isometric embedding $\\psi: Y \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as the identity map, $\\psi(y) = y$. The image is $\\psi(Y) = [0,b]$.\nTo minimize the Hausdorff distance to $\\psi(Y)$, we should embed $X$ such that its image is centered within $\\psi(Y)$. We define the embedding $\\varphi: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $\\varphi(x) = x + c$, where $c$ is a constant chosen to place the interval $[c, a+c]$ centrally within $[0,b]$. The optimal placement gives $c = \\frac{b-a}{2}$. This map is an isometry because it is a simple translation.\nThe image of $X$ is $\\varphi(X) = \\left[\\frac{b-a}{2}, a + \\frac{b-a}{2}\\right] = \\left[\\frac{b-a}{2}, \\frac{b+a}{2}\\right]$.\nSince $a \\le b$, we have $0 \\le \\frac{b-a}{2}$. Also, $\\frac{b+a}{2} \\le \\frac{b+b}{2}=b$. Thus, $\\varphi(X) \\subseteq \\psi(Y)$.\n\nNow, we compute the Hausdorff distance $d_{H}^{\\mathbb{R}}(\\varphi(X), \\psi(Y))$. By definition,\n$$d_{H}^{\\mathbb{R}}(\\varphi(X),\\psi(Y)) = \\max\\left\\{\\sup_{u \\in \\varphi(X)}\\inf_{v \\in \\psi(Y)} d_{\\mathbb{R}}(u,v),\\; \\sup_{v \\in \\psi(Y)}\\inf_{u \\in \\varphi(X)} d_{\\mathbb{R}}(u,v)\\right\\}.$$\nSince $\\varphi(X) \\subseteq \\psi(Y)$, for any $u \\in \\varphi(X)$, we have $u \\in \\psi(Y)$, so $\\inf_{v \\in \\psi(Y)} d_{\\mathbb{R}}(u,v) = 0$. The first term in the 'max' is therefore $0$.\nThe distance becomes\n$$d_{H}^{\\mathbb{R}}(\\varphi(X),\\psi(Y)) = \\sup_{v \\in \\psi(Y)} \\inf_{u \\in \\varphi(X)} d_{\\mathbb{R}}(u,v) = \\sup_{v \\in [0,b]} d_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(v, \\left[\\frac{b-a}{2}, \\frac{b+a}{2}\\right]\\right).$$\nThe distance from a point $v$ to a closed interval is maximized at the points furthest from the interval. The set $\\psi(Y) = [0,b]$ has two endpoints, $0$ and $b$.\nThe distance from $v=0$ to the interval $\\left[\\frac{b-a}{2}, \\frac{b+a}{2}\\right]$ is $d_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(0, \\frac{b-a}{2}\\right) = \\frac{b-a}{2}$.\nThe distance from $v=b$ to the interval is $d_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(b, \\frac{b+a}{2}\\right) = b - \\frac{b+a}{2} = \\frac{b-a}{2}$.\nFor any point $v \\in [0,b]$, its distance to the interval $\\left[\\frac{b-a}{2}, \\frac{b+a}{2}\\right]$ will not exceed $\\frac{b-a}{2}$.\nThus, the supremum is $\\frac{b-a}{2}$.\nSo for this particular choice of embeddings, the Hausdorff distance is $\\frac{b-a}{2}$. Since the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is the infimum over all possible embeddings, we have the upper bound:\n$$d_{GH}(X,Y) \\le \\frac{b-a}{2}.$$\n\nNext, we establish a lower bound. Let $d = d_{GH}(X,Y)$. By the definition of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exist a metric space $(Z, d_Z)$ and isometric embeddings $\\varphi: X \\to Z$ and $\\psi: Y \\to Z$ such that $d_H^Z(\\varphi(X), \\psi(Y)) < d + \\epsilon$.\nThis implies that for any point $p \\in \\psi(Y)$, there exists a point $q \\in \\varphi(X)$ such that $d_Z(p,q) < d+\\epsilon$.\nLet's consider the points $y_1 = 0$ and $y_2 = b$ in $Y$. These points realize the diameter of $Y$, $\\text{diam}(Y) = d_Y(y_1, y_2) = b$.\nBecause $d_H^Z(\\varphi(X), \\psi(Y)) < d+\\epsilon$, there must exist points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$ such that $d_Z(\\psi(y_1), \\varphi(x_1)) < d+\\epsilon$ and $d_Z(\\psi(y_2), \\varphi(x_2)) < d+\\epsilon$.\nThe map $\\psi$ is an isometry, so $d_Z(\\psi(y_1), \\psi(y_2)) = d_Y(y_1, y_2) = b$.\nUsing the triangle inequality in $Z$:\n$$d_Z(\\psi(y_1), \\psi(y_2)) \\le d_Z(\\psi(y_1), \\varphi(x_1)) + d_Z(\\varphi(x_1), \\varphi(x_2)) + d_Z(\\varphi(x_2), \\psi(y_2)).$$\nSubstituting the known values and bounds:\n$$b < (d+\\epsilon) + d_Z(\\varphi(x_1), \\varphi(x_2)) + (d+\\epsilon).$$\nSince $\\varphi$ is an isometry, $d_Z(\\varphi(x_1), \\varphi(x_2)) = d_X(x_1, x_2) = |x_1-x_2|$. The distance $|x_1-x_2|$ is bounded by the diameter of $X$, which is $a$.\nSo, we have:\n$$b < 2(d+\\epsilon) + d_X(x_1, x_2) \\le 2(d+\\epsilon) + \\text{diam}(X) = 2(d+\\epsilon) + a.$$\nThis gives the inequality $b-a < 2(d+\\epsilon)$. As this must hold for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can take the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$:\n$$b-a \\le 2d.$$\nThis implies $d \\ge \\frac{b-a}{2}$. This provides the lower bound for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance:\n$$d_{GH}(X,Y) \\ge \\frac{b-a}{2}.$$\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we have $\\frac{b-a}{2} \\le d_{GH}(X,Y) \\le \\frac{b-a}{2}$, which forces the equality:\n$$d_{GH}\\!\\left([0,a],[0,b]\\right) = \\frac{b-a}{2}.$$\nThis result was derived under the assumption $a \\le b$. If we had assumed $b \\le a$, the same argument would yield $d_{GH}\\!\\left([0,a],[0,b]\\right) = \\frac{a-b}{2}$. To cover all cases for $a>0$ and $b>0$, we use the absolute value:\n$$d_{GH}\\!\\left([0,a],[0,b]\\right) = \\frac{|a-b|}{2}.$$\nThis is the final expression for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the two specified compact metric spaces.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{|a-b|}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3048479"}, {"introduction": "While the definition of Gromov-Hausdorff distance via embeddings is fundamental, it is often impractical for direct computation.

No flaws are identified in the problem setup.\n\nThe core principle for this problem is Gromov's compactness theorem. A key version of this theorem states that for a fixed dimension $n$, the class of compact Riemannian $n$-manifolds $(M, g)$ satisfying a uniform lower bound on Ricci curvature, $\\operatorname{Ric}(g) \\ge (n-1)\\kappa$ for some constant $\\kappa$, and a uniform upper bound on diameter, $\\operatorname{diam}(M) \\le D$, is precompact in the Gromov-Hausdorff ($d_{GH}$) metric.\n\nA uniform two-sided bound on sectional curvature, $|\\sec_M| \\le K$ for some $K \\ge 0$, implies a uniform lower bound on sectional curvature, $\\sec_M \\ge -K$. For an $n$-dimensional manifold, the Ricci curvature in a direction $v$ is the average of sectional curvatures of $2$-planes containing $v$. Specifically, if $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ is an orthonormal basis with $e_1=v$, then $\\operatorname{Ric}(v,v) = \\sum_{i=2}^n \\sec(v, e_i)$.

Collapsing occurs when a sequence in such a precompact class converges to a limit space of a strictly lower dimension. This typically happens when the volume of the manifolds in the sequence tends to $0$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n### Option A\n\n(i) The example sequence is $\\{M_k\\}$, where $M_k = S^1(1/k) \\times S^2(1)$. The dimension is $n=3$.\n- **Sectional Curvature**: For a product manifold $N_1 \\times N_2$, the sectional curvature of a plane spanned by vectors tangent to both factors is $0$. The sectional curvature of a plane tangent to the $S^2(1)$ factor is the curvature of $S^2(1)$, which is $1/1^2 = 1$. The sectional curvature of a plane tangent to the $S^1(1/k)$ factor is the curvature of $S^1(1/k)$, which is $0$. Therefore, the sectional curvatures of $M_k$ are either $0$ or $1$. Thus, we have a uniform bound $|\\sec_{M_k}| \\le 1$ for all $k$.\n- **Diameter**: The diameter of a product of metric spaces $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ with the product metric is $\\operatorname{diam}(X \\times Y) = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{diam}(X)^2 + \\operatorname{diam}(Y)^2}$. Here, $\\operatorname{diam}(S^1(r)) = \\pi r$ and $\\operatorname{diam}(S^2(r)) = \\pi r$. So, $\\operatorname{diam}(M_k) = \\sqrt{(\\pi/k)^2 + (\\pi \\cdot 1)^2} = \\pi \\sqrt{1/k^2 + 1}$. As $k \\to \\infty$, $\\operatorname{diam}(M_k) \\to \\pi$. The sequence of diameters is bounded, for instance by $\\operatorname{diam}(M_1) = \\pi\\sqrt{2}$.\n- **Collapsing**: As $k \\to \\infty$, the factor $S^1(1/k)$ shrinks in size and converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a single point. Consequently, the sequence $\\{M_k\\}$ converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff metric to $S^2(1)$. The topological dimension of the limit space is $\\dim(S^2(1)) = 2$, which is less than the dimension of the manifolds $n=3$. This is a canonical example of collapsing.\nPart (i) is correct.\n\n(ii) The reason given is that the class is $d_{GH}$-precompact because Gromov's theorem guarantees precompactness for classes with a uniform lower Ricci bound and a uniform upper diameter bound, and that a two-sided sectional curvature bound implies the required Ricci bound. As established above, this line of reasoning is perfectly sound.

For $M_k = S^n(1/k)$, the sectional curvature is $\\sec_{M_k} \\equiv 1/(1/k)^2 = k^2$.

This is uniformly bounded, e.g., $|\\sec_{M_k}| \\le 1$.\n- **Diameter**: Using the product formula as in Option A, $\\operatorname{diam}(M_k) = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{diam}(S^1(1))^2 + \\operatorname{diam}(S^1(1/k))^2} = \\sqrt{\\pi^2 + (\\pi/k)^2}$. As $k \\to \\infty$, $\\operatorname{diam}(M_k) \\to \\pi$. This sequence is uniformly bounded.\n- **Collapsing**: As $k \\to \\infty$, the $S^1(1/k)$ factor shrinks to a point. The sequence $\\{M_k\\}$ converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff metric to $S^1(1)$. The dimension of the limit is $\\dim(S^1(1)) = 1$, which is less than the dimension of the manifolds $n=2$. This is another canonical example of collapsing.\nPart (i) is correct.\n\n(ii) The reason given is identical in its logical structure to the one in Option A: precompactness follows from Gromov's theorem applied to a class with a uniform lower Ricci bound and a uniform upper diameter bound, and the uniform sectional curvature bound provides the necessary Ricci bound. As noted before, this is correct. Since $\\sec_{M_k} \\equiv 0$, the Ricci curvature is also $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M_k} \\equiv 0$, which is uniformly bounded below.\nPart (ii) is correct.\n\nSince both (i) and (ii) are correct, this option is valid.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n### Option D\n\n(i) The example sequence is $\\{M_k\\}$, a sequence of closed hyperbolic surfaces of genus $k$ with $\\sec \\equiv -1$ and $\\operatorname{diam}(M_k) \\le \\pi$.\n- **Existence of sequence**: For a closed hyperbolic surface $S_g$ of genus $g$, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem implies its area is $A(S_g) = 2\\pi(2g-2)$. As the genus $k \\to \\infty$, the area $A(M_k) \\to \\infty$. There are various results relating diameter and genus/area for hyperbolic surfaces. For instance, a result by Bavard shows that $\\operatorname{diam}(S_g)$ grows logarithmically with $g$, i.e., $\\operatorname{diam}(S_g) \\sim \\log(g)$. Therefore, the diameter cannot be uniformly bounded by $\\pi$ as $k \\to \\infty$. The sequence of manifolds described in this option does not exist.\nPart (i) is incorrect because it is based on a false premise.\n\n(ii) The reason given is that \"the class is not $d_{GH}$-precompact because collapsing prevents $d_{GH}$-precompactness\". This statement is fundamentally incorrect. Precompactness means every sequence has a convergent subsequence. Collapsing is a possible mode of convergence for sequences in a $d_{GH}$-precompact class. Far from preventing precompactness, collapsing is a phenomenon that occurs within precompact classes of manifolds when a uniform positive lower bound on volume is not present.
