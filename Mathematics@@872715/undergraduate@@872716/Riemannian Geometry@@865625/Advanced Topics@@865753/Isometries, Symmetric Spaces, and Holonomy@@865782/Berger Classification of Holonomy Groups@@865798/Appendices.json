No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the dimension of the Lie algebra of the restricted holonomy group at the origin $0 \\in M$ for the manifold $M=\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ equipped with its standard flat Hermitian metric $g$.\n\nLet us begin by formalizing the provided information. The manifold is $M = \\mathbb{C}^{n}$, which is identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ as a real differentiable manifold. Let $(z^1, \\dots, z^n)$ be the standard complex coordinates on $\\mathbb{C}^n$, where each $z^j = x^j + i y^j$ for $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The tangent space $T_p M$ at any point $p \\in M$ is a $2n$-dimensional real vector space. The standard complex structure $J$ is a linear map on each tangent space such that $J^2 = -\\text{Id}$, which in these coordinates corresponds to multiplication by $i$.\n\nThe metric $g$ is the standard flat Hermitian metric. In complex coordinates, it is given by:\n$$\ng = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dz^j \\otimes d\\bar{z}^j\n$$\nIn terms of the real coordinates $(x^1, y^1, \\dots, x^n, y^n)$, this metric is the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$:\n$$\ng = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (dx^j \\otimes dx^j + dy^j \\otimes dy^j)\n$$\nIn this real coordinate system, the components of the metric tensor, $g_{ab}$, form the $2n \\times 2n$ identity matrix. Crucially, all components $g_{ab}$ are constant throughout the manifold $M$.\n\nThe problem concerns the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ associated with the metric $g$. The components of this connection, the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^c_{ab}$, are given by the Koszul formula:\n$$\n\\Gamma^c_{ab} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{cd} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{da}}{\\partial x^b} + \\frac{\\partial g_{db}}{\\partial x^a} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ab}}{\\partial x^d} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $(x^1, \\dots, x^{2n})$ represents the real coordinates. Since all metric components $g_{ab}$ are constant, their partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate are zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g_{ab}}{\\partial x^c} = 0 \\quad \\forall a, b, c\n$$\nConsequently, all Christoffel symbols are identically zero in this global coordinate system:\n$$\n\\Gamma^c_{ab} = 0 \\quad \\forall a, b, c\n$$\nThe problem explicitly mentions the equivalence between flatness and a vanishing Riemann curvature tensor $R$. The components of the Riemann curvature tensor are defined in terms of the Christoffel symbols:\n$$\nR^d_{abc} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^d_{ac}}{\\partial x^b} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^d_{ab}}{\\partial x^c} + \\sum_{e=1}^{2n} (\\Gamma^e_{ac} \\Gamma^d_{eb} - \\Gamma^e_{ab} \\Gamma^d_{ec})\n$$\nSince all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^c_{ab}$ are zero, their partial derivatives are also zero. Therefore, every component of the Riemann curvature tensor is zero:\n$$\nR^d_{abc} = 0 \\quad \\forall a, b, c, d\n$$\nThis confirms that the manifold $(M, g)$ is flat, as stated.\n\nThe holonomy group at a point $p \\in M$ is generated by parallel transport around closed loops based at $p$. The parallel transport of a vector field $V$ along a curve $\\gamma(t)$ is governed by the differential equation $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)} V = 0$. In our coordinate system, this equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d V^a}{dt} + \\sum_{b,c=1}^{2n} \\Gamma^a_{bc} \\frac{dx^b}{dt} V^c = 0\n$$\nwhere $V^a$ are the components of the vector field $V$ and $\\frac{dx^b}{dt}$ are the components of the tangent vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. Since all $\\Gamma^a_{bc}$ are zero, this equation simplifies dramatically to:\n$$\n\\frac{d V^a}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThis implies that for any curve $\\gamma(t)$, the components of a vector remain constant under parallel transport along that curve.\n\nLet $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to M$ be any piecewise smooth loop based at the origin, so that $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(1) = 0$. Let $v_0 \\in T_0 M$ be a vector at the origin. Let $V(t)$ be the vector field along $\\gamma$ obtained by parallel transporting $v_0$. The resulting vector at the end of the loop is $v_1 = V(1) \\in T_{\\gamma(1)}M = T_0 M$. Because the components of $V(t)$ are constant in our global coordinate system, the components of $v_1$ are identical to the components of $v_0$. This means that the linear map of parallel transport along any loop $\\gamma$, denoted $P_\\gamma: T_0 M \\to T_0 M$, is the identity map: $P_\\gamma = \\text{Id}$.\n\nThe (restricted) holonomy group at the origin, $\\text{Hol}_0(M)$, is the group of all such parallel transport maps. Since every such map is the identity, the holonomy group is the trivial group containing only the identity element:\n$$\n\\text{Hol}_0(M) = \\{ \\text{Id} \\}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the dimension of the Lie algebra of this group, denoted $\\mathfrak{hol}_0(M)$. The Lie algebra is the tangent space to the Lie group at the identity. For a discrete group like the trivial group, which is a $0$-dimensional manifold, the tangent space at its single point is the zero vector space, $\\{0\\}$. Therefore, the dimension of the Lie algebra is $0$.\n\nThis result is powerfully explained by the Ambrose-Singer theorem, which states that the Lie algebra of the holonomy group, $\\mathfrak{hol}_p(M)$, is generated by all curvature operators $R(X,Y)$ for $X,Y \\in T_pM$, and their parallel transports. Since the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is identically zero on $M$, the set of generators for $\\mathfrak{hol}_0(M)$ is empty or consists only of the zero operator. The Lie algebra generated by the zero operator is the trivial Lie algebra $\\{0\\}$, whose dimension is $0$.\n\nThe problem also asks why the holonomy group is trivial rather than $U(n)$. The manifold $(M, g, J)$ is indeed a Kähler manifold. For any Kähler manifold of complex dimension $n$, the holonomy group is a subgroup of the unitary group $U(n)$, because the Levi-Civita connection preserves both the metric $g$ and the complex structure $J$. The group $U(n)$ is the group of linear transformations of $\\mathbb{C}^n$ that preserve the standard Hermitian inner product. However, Berger's list of possible holonomy groups applies to irreducible Riemannian manifolds. The manifold $\\mathbb{C}^n$ with the product metric is reducible: $(M, g) = (\\mathbb{C}, g_1) \\times \\cdots \\times (\\mathbb{C}, g_1)$, where $g_1$ is the flat metric on $\\mathbb{C}$. The holonomy of a product is the product of the holonomies. Since each factor $(\\mathbb{C}, g_1)$ is flat, its holonomy is trivial. The product of trivial groups is trivial.\n\nMost fundamentally, the holonomy group is determined by the curvature. A non-trivial holonomy group like $U(n)$ or its subgroup $SU(n)$ has a non-zero Lie algebra ($\\mathfrak{u}(n)$ has dimension $n^2$). According to the Ambrose-Singer theorem, a non-zero holonomy Lie algebra requires non-zero curvature. The manifold $\\mathbb{C}^n$ with its standard metric is flat ($R=0$), so its holonomy Lie algebra must be the zero algebra. This forces the holonomy group to be trivial (since $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is simply connected). The group $U(n)$ arises as the holonomy group for a generic *curved* Kähler manifold, such as the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ with the Fubini-Study metric. The flatness of $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is the direct reason its holonomy is as small as possible, i.e., trivial, rather than the maximal possible $U(n)$.\n\nThe dimension of the trivial Lie algebra $\\{0\\}$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3038261"}, {"introduction": "Next, we move from a flat space to the archetypal example of a curved one: the round sphere $S^n$. This practice demonstrates how constant, non-zero curvature generates a rich and non-trivial holonomy group.

We will proceed from the fundamental relationship between curvature and holonomy as requested.\n\nThe holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}$ is the group of linear isometries of the tangent space $T_{p}S^{n}$ obtained by parallel transport of vectors along all possible closed loops based at $p$. The holonomy algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}$ is the Lie algebra of $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}$. It represents the infinitesimal transformations generated by parallel transport.\n\nThe Ambrose-Singer theorem provides the crucial link between the holonomy algebra and the Riemann curvature tensor. The \"infinitesimal loops\" mentioned in the problem statement form the intuitive basis for this theorem. Parallel transport of a tangent vector $Z \\in T_{p}S^{n}$ around an infinitesimal parallelogram at $p$, spanned by vector fields corresponding to tangent vectors $X$ and $Y$, results in a deviation from its original orientation. This deviation is, to leading order, given by the action of the curvature endomorphism $R_{p}(X,Y)$ on $Z$. More formally, if $P_{\\epsilon}$ is the parallel transport map along the boundary of the parallelogram spanned by $\\epsilon X$ and $\\epsilon Y$, then as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, we have:\n$$P_{\\epsilon}(Z) = Z + \\epsilon^{2} R_{p}(X,Y)Z + O(\\epsilon^{3})$$\nThis shows that the curvature endomorphisms, defined from the Riemann tensor $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_{X}\\nabla_{Y}Z - \\nabla_{Y}\\nabla_{X}Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$, are the infinitesimal generators of the holonomy transformations. The Ambrose-Singer theorem states rigorously that the holonomy algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}$ is the Lie algebra generated by the set of all curvature endomorphisms $\\{R_{p}(X,Y) \\mid X,Y \\in T_{p}S^{n}\\}$.\n\nOur derivation proceeds in three steps:\n$1$. We first determine the explicit form of the curvature endomorphism $R_{p}(X,Y)$ using the geometric property that $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{round}})$ has constant sectional curvature $K=1$.\n$2$. We then identify the linear space of operators spanned by the set $\\{R_{p}(X,Y) \\mid X,Y \\in T_{p}S^{n}\\}$.\n$3$. Finally, we apply the Ambrose-Singer theorem aformentioned to deduce the holonomy algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}$.\n\nFirst, a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ has constant sectional curvature $K$ if and only if for every $p \\in M$ and all $X,Y,Z \\in T_{p}M$, the Riemann curvature tensor is given by the formula:\n$$R(X,Y)Z = K(g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y)$$\nThe problem specifies that the standard sphere $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{round}})$ is normalized so that its sectional curvature is $K=1$. Therefore, for any point $p \\in S^{n}$ and any tangent vectors $X, Y, Z \\in T_{p}S^{n}$, the curvature tensor is:\n$$R(X,Y)Z = g_{\\mathrm{round}}(Y,Z)X - g_{\\mathrm{round}}(X,Z)Y$$\nHereafter, we denote the metric $g_{\\mathrm{round}}$ simply by $g$.\n\nThe curvature endomorphism $R_{p}(X,Y) \\colon T_{p}S^{n} \\to T_{p}S^{n}$ is the linear map $Z \\mapsto R(X,Y)Z$. Its explicit form is:\n$$R_{p}(X,Y)(Z) = g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y$$\nSince the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}$ consists of isometries of $(T_{p}S^{n}, g_{p})$, it is a subgroup of the orthogonal group $\\mathrm{O}(n)$. For $n \\geq 2$, the sphere $S^n$ is orientable, and thus parallel transport preserves orientation, which confines the holonomy group to the special orthogonal group $\\mathrm{SO}(n)$. Consequently, its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}$ must be a subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$, the Lie algebra of skew-symmetric endomorphisms of $T_{p}S^{n}$ with respect to the metric $g$. Let's verify that each $R_{p}(X,Y)$ is indeed a skew-symmetric endomorphism. An endomorphism $A$ is skew-symmetric if $g(AZ,W) + g(Z,AW) = 0$ for all $Z, W \\in T_{p}S^{n}$. Setting $A = R_{p}(X,Y)$:\n$$g(R_{p}(X,Y)Z, W) = g(g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y, W) = g(Y,Z)g(X,W) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W)$$\n$$g(Z, R_{p}(X,Y)W) = g(Z, g(Y,W)X - g(X,W)Y) = g(Y,W)g(Z,X) - g(X,W)g(Z,Y)$$\nSumming these two expressions yields $0$, which confirms that $R_{p}(X,Y) \\in \\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}S^{n})$ for all $X, Y \\in T_{p}S^{n}$.\n\nNext, we identify the specific subalgebra generated by these endomorphisms. Let $\\{e_{1}, e_{2}, \\dots, e_{n}\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_{p}S^{n}$. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}S^{n})$, which we identify with $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$, is a vector space of dimension $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. A standard basis for $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$ is the set of endomorphisms $\\{E_{ij}\\}_{1 \\le i < j \\le n}$, whose action on the basis vectors is defined as:\n$$E_{ij}(e_{k}) = \\delta_{jk}e_{i} - \\delta_{ik}e_{j}$$\nThis operator maps $e_{j}$ to $e_{i}$, $e_{i}$ to $-e_{j}$, and all other basis vectors $e_{k}$ (where $k \\neq i, j$) to the zero vector.\n\nLet us compute the curvature endomorphism $R_{p}(e_{i}, e_{j})$ for any pair of distinct orthonormal basis vectors $e_{i}, e_{j}$. For any vector $Z \\in T_{p}S^{n}$:\n$$R_{p}(e_{i}, e_{j})(Z) = g(e_{j},Z)e_{i} - g(e_{i},Z)e_{j}$$\nApplying this to a basis vector $e_{k}$:\n$$R_{p}(e_{i}, e_{j})(e_{k}) = g(e_{j}, e_{k})e_{i} - g(e_{i}, e_{k})e_{j} = \\delta_{jk}e_{i} - \\delta_{ik}e_{j}$$\nThis is precisely the action of the basis element $E_{ij}$ of $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$. Thus, we have $R_{p}(e_{i}, e_{j}) = E_{ij}$ for $i<j$. Since we can choose any pair $(i,j)$ with $1 \\le i < j \\le n$, we can generate all the basis elements of $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$ as specific curvature endomorphisms.\n\nAny arbitrary curvature operator $R_{p}(X,Y)$ is a linear combination of these basis operators. If we express $X = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x^{i}e_{i}$ and $Y = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} y^{j}e_{j}$, the bilinearity and skew-symmetry of $R_{p}(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ imply:\n$$R_{p}(X,Y) = \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le n} (x^{i}y^{j} - x^{j}y^{i}) R_{p}(e_{i}, e_{j})$$\nThis shows that the linear space spanned by the set of all curvature endomorphisms $\\{R_{p}(X,Y) \\mid X,Y \\in T_{p}S^{n}\\}$ is the same as the linear space spanned by the basis $\\{R_{p}(e_{i}, e_{j})\\}_{1 \\le i < j \\le n}$. This space is the entire Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}S^{n})$.\n\nAccording to the Ambrose-Singer theorem, $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}$ is the smallest Lie subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}S^{n})$ that contains the set of all curvature endomorphisms. We have just shown that the linear span of this set is $\\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}S^{n})$ itself. Since $\\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}S^{n})$ is a Lie algebra, it is closed under the Lie bracket. Therefore, the smallest Lie algebra containing $\\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}S^{n})$ is trivially $\\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}S^{n})$ itself.\n\nWe conclude that the holonomy algebra is the entire Lie algebra of skew-symmetric endomorphisms on the tangent space.
