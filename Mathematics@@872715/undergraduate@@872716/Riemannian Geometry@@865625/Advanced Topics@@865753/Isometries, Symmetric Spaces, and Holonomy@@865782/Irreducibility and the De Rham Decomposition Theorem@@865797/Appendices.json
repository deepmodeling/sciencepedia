Let Greek indices $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\in \\{1,\\dots,p\\}$ and Latin indices $a,b,c \\in \\{1,\\dots,q\\}$ distinguish the blocks. The metric is $g=g_{\\alpha\\beta}(x,y)(dx^{\\alpha}dx^{\\beta}) \\oplus g_{ab}(x,y)(dy^{a}dy^{b})$.\n\nThe mixed Christoffel symbols fall into four types: $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{ab}$, $\\Gamma^{c}_{\\alpha\\beta}$, $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{a\\beta}$, $\\Gamma^{c}_{\\alpha b}$.\n- $\\Gamma^{c}_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{cd}(\\partial_{\\alpha}g_{\\beta d} + \\partial_{\\beta}g_{\\alpha d} - \\partial_{d}g_{\\alpha\\beta})$. Since $g$ is block-diagonal, $g_{\\beta d}=g_{\\alpha d}=0$. Thus, $\\Gamma^{c}_{\\alpha\\beta} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{cd}\\partial_{d}g_{\\alpha\\beta}$. This vanishes for all $\\alpha,\\beta,c$ if and only if $\\partial_{d}g_{\\alpha\\beta} = 0$ for all $d,\\alpha,\\beta$, which is the condition $\\partial_{y}g_{(1)} \\equiv 0$.\n- Similarly, $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{ab} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{\\gamma\\delta}\\partial_{\\delta}g_{ab}$. This vanishes for all $a,b,\\gamma$ if and only if $\\partial_{\\delta}g_{ab}=0$ for all $\\delta,a,b$, which is $\\partial_{x}g_{(2)} \\equiv 0$.\n- $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{a\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{\\gamma\\delta}(\\partial_{a}g_{\\beta\\delta} + \\partial_{\\beta}g_{a\\delta} - \\partial_{\\delta}g_{a\\beta})$. The last two terms vanish. So $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{a\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{\\gamma\\delta}\\partial_{a}g_{\\beta\\delta}$. This vanishes iff $\\partial_{y}g_{(1)} \\equiv 0$.\n- Similarly, $\\Gamma^{c}_{\\alpha b} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{cd}\\partial_{\\alpha}g_{bd}$. This vanishes iff $\\partial_{x}g_{(2)} \\equiv 0$.\n\nThus, all mixed Christoffel symbols vanish if and only if $\\partial_{y}g_{(1)} \\equiv 0$ and $\\partial_{x}g_{(2)} \\equiv 0$.\n\nA distribution $D$ is parallel if for any vector field $X$ on the manifold and any section $Y$ of $D$, $\\nabla_{X}Y$ is also a section of $D$.\nLet's check parallelism of $E=\\mathrm{span}\\{\\partial_{\\alpha}\\}$. Take $X=\\partial_{\\beta}$ and $Y=\\partial_{\\gamma}$ (both in $E$). $\\nabla_{\\partial_{\\beta}}\\partial_{\\gamma} = \\Gamma^{\\delta}_{\\beta\\gamma}\\partial_{\\delta} + \\Gamma^{c}_{\\beta\\gamma}\\partial_{c}$. For this to be in $E$, we need $\\Gamma^{c}_{\\beta\\gamma}=0$. Now take $X=\\partial_{a}$ (in $F$) and $Y=\\partial_{\\gamma}$ (in $E$). $\\nabla_{\\partial_{a}}\\partial_{\\gamma} = \\Gamma^{\\delta}_{a\\gamma}\\partial_{\\delta} + \\Gamma^{c}_{a\\gamma}\\partial_{c}$. For this to be in $E$, we need $\\Gamma^{c}_{a\\gamma}=0$. Parallelism of $F$ similarly requires $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{ab}=0$ and $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{b\\alpha}=0$.\nTherefore, the distributions $E$ and $F$ are both parallel if and only if all mixed Christoffel symbols vanish.\n\nBy the Frobenius theorem, a parallel distribution is always integrable. When the tangent bundle splits into a direct sum of orthogonal, parallel distributions, $TM=E \\oplus F$, the manifold is locally isometric to a Riemannian product of the integral submanifolds of $E$ and $F$.\n\nConversely, if $(M,g)$ is locally a Riemannian product $(U_{1} \\times U_{2}, g_{1} \\oplus g_{2})$, then in product coordinates $(x,y)$, the metric components are $g_{\\alpha\\beta}(x)$ and $g_{ab}(y)$. By definition, this means $\\partial_{y}g_{(1)} \\equiv 0$ and $\\partial_{x}g_{(2)} \\equiv 0$, which implies all mixed Christoffel symbols are zero.\n\nThe de Rham decomposition theorem is a global statement: a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is isometric to a Riemannian product $M_{0} \\times M_{1} \\times \\dots \\times M_{k}$ (where $M_{0}$ is a Euclidean space and $M_{i}$ are irreducible) if and only if the holonomy group of $(M,g)$ acts reducibly on the tangent space. The local criterion derived above (vanishing of mixed Christoffel symbols) is the infinitesimal condition for the holonomy group to be reducible, preserving the subspaces $E$ and $F$. Thus, it is the local version of the geometric condition underlying the de Rham theorem.\n\n**3) Computation of $F(x^{1},x^{2},y)$**\n\nThe function $F$ is defined as the sum of squares of specific Christoffel symbols:\n$$\nF = (\\Gamma^{3}_{11})^{2}+(\\Gamma^{3}_{22})^{2}+(\\Gamma^{1}_{33})^{2}+(\\Gamma^{1}_{13})^{2}+(\\Gamma^{2}_{23})^{2}+(\\Gamma^{3}_{31})^{2}\n$$\nThe problem statement makes no mention of $x^2$ in the definition of $F$, so it is implicitly a function of $x^1$ and $y$.

All data and definitions are provided, and the questions are answerable through standard mathematical procedures. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe manifold is $M = \\mathbb{S}^{1} \\times (0,1)$ with local coordinates $(\\theta, t)$, where $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{S}^1$ and $t \\in (0,1)$. The Riemannian metric is given by $g = r^{2}\\, d\\theta^{2} + dt^{2}$, where $r > 0$ is a constant. In the coordinate basis $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\}$, the metric tensor components are $g_{\\theta\\theta} = r^{2}$, $g_{tt} = 1$, and $g_{\\theta t} = g_{t\\theta} = 0$. The vector field is $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$.\n\n**1. Proof that $X$ is a parallel vector field**\n\nA vector field $X$ is parallel if its covariant derivative with respect to any vector field $Y$ is zero, i.e., $\\nabla_Y X = 0$. It is sufficient to show this for the basis vector fields $Y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$ and $Y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$. The components of the covariant derivative are given by $(\\nabla_{V} W)^{k} = V^{j}(\\frac{\\partial W^{k}}{\\partial x^{j}} + \\Gamma^{k}_{ji} W^{i})$, where $\\Gamma^{k}_{ji}$ are the Christoffel symbols.\n\nThe Christoffel symbols are calculated using the formula $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$, where we use coordinates $x^1 = \\theta$ and $x^2 = t$.\nThe metric components are $g_{11} = r^2$, $g_{22} = 1$, and $g_{12} = 0$. Since $r$ is a constant, all metric components are constant functions on $M$. Consequently, all their partial derivatives are zero: $\\partial_k g_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j,k \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\nSubstituting this into the formula for the Christoffel symbols, we find that $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j,k$.\n\nThe vector field $X$ is given by $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$. In our coordinate system, its components are $X^1 = X^\\theta = 0$ and $X^2 = X^t = 1$. These components are also constants.\n\nNow we compute the covariant derivative of $X$. Let $Y$ be an arbitrary vector field.\n$$(\\nabla_Y X)^k = Y^j \\left( \\frac{\\partial X^k}{\\partial x^j} + \\Gamma^k_{ji} X^i \\right)$$\nSince all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ji}$ are zero, the expression simplifies to:\n$$(\\nabla_Y X)^k = Y^j \\frac{\\partial X^k}{\\partial x^j}$$\nThe components of $X$ are $X^1=0$ and $X^2=1$. Their partial derivatives with respect to either coordinate $\\theta$ or $t$ are all zero: $\\frac{\\partial X^k}{\\partial x^j} = 0$ for all $j,k$.\nTherefore, $(\\nabla_Y X)^k = 0$ for all components $k$ and any vector field $Y$. This implies $\\nabla_Y X = 0$, which proves that $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is a parallel vector field on $(M,g)$.\n\n**2. Determination of the maximal symmetric interval for the flow**\n\nAn integral curve $\\gamma(s) = (\\theta(s), t(s))$ of the vector field $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ must satisfy the differential equation $\\frac{d\\gamma}{ds} = X(\\gamma(s))$.\nIn coordinates, this equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d}{ds}(\\theta(s), t(s)) = (\\dot{\\theta}(s), \\dot{t}(s))$$\nThe vector field $X$ in this coordinate system has components $(0,1)$, because $X = 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$.\nThus, the system of ordinary differential equations is:\n$$ \\dot{\\theta}(s) = 0 $$\n$$ \\dot{t}(s) = 1 $$\nWe are given the initial condition $\\gamma(0) = (\\theta_0, t_0)$ with $t_0 = \\frac{2}{7}$.\nIntegrating the first equation, $\\theta(s) = C_1$. Using the initial condition $\\theta(0) = \\theta_0$, we get $\\theta(s) = \\theta_0$ for all $s$.\nIntegrating the second equation, $t(s) = s + C_2$. Using the initial condition $t(0) = \\frac{2}{7}$, we get $t(s) = s + \\frac{2}{7}$.\nThe integral curve is therefore $\\gamma(s) = (\\theta_0, s + \\frac{2}{7})$.\n\nThe flow $\\phi_s$ of $X$ exists as long as the point $\\gamma(s)$ remains within the manifold $M = \\mathbb{S}^1 \\times (0,1)$. The $\\theta$-coordinate $\\theta_0$ is constant and always in $\\mathbb{S}^1$. The condition for the curve to be in $M$ is that its $t$-coordinate must lie in the interval $(0,1)$.\n$$ 0 < t(s) < 1 $$\n$$ 0 < s + \\frac{2}{7} < 1 $$\nWe solve this compound inequality for $s$:\n1. $s + \\frac{2}{7} > 0 \\implies s > -\\frac{2}{7}$\n2. $s + \\frac{2}{7} < 1 \\implies s < 1 - \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{5}{7}$\nThe maximal interval of existence for the flow along this integral curve is $s \\in (-\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{5}{7})$.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest symmetric open interval $(-\\rho, \\rho)$ such that the flow exists for all $s \\in (-\\rho, \\rho)$. This interval must be contained within the maximal interval of existence.\n$$ (-\\rho, \\rho) \\subseteq \\left(-\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{5}{7}\\right) $$\nThis requires that $-\\rho \\ge -\\frac{2}{7}$ and $\\rho \\le \\frac{5}{7}$.\nThe first inequality implies $\\rho \\le \\frac{2}{7}$. To satisfy both conditions, $\\rho$ must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two bounds:\n$$ \\rho \\le \\min\\left(\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{5}{7}\\right) = \\frac{2}{7} $$\nThe largest possible value for $\\rho$ is therefore $\\frac{2}{7}$.\n\n**3. Explanation regarding the de Rham decomposition theorem**\n\nThe de Rham decomposition theorem states that if a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold $(N,h)$ has a reducible holonomy group, then it splits globally as a Riemannian product $N = N_1 \\times N_2$, where the tangent spaces of $N_1$ and $N_2$ correspond to the invariant subspaces under the holonomy action.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the holonomy of $(M,g)$. As shown in Part 1, the vector field $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is parallel. The existence of a non-zero parallel vector field implies that the holonomy group $\\text{Hol}_p(M)$ at any point $p \\in M$ fixes the vector $X_p \\in T_p M$. Thus, the one-dimensional subspace $\\text{span}\\{X_p\\}$ is a proper, invariant subspace of the tangent space $T_pM$ (which has dimension $2$). By definition, this means the holonomy group of $(M,g)$ is reducible. A local version of the de Rham theorem then implies that $(M,g)$ is locally isometric to a Riemannian product, which is already obvious from its given metric $g = r^2 d\\theta^2 + dt^2$. This is a local product of a circle (locally $\\mathbb{R}$) and a line segment.\n\nHowever, for a *global* splitting guaranteed by the full de Rham theorem, two crucial hypotheses must be met: the manifold must be complete and simply connected. Let's examine these for $(M,g)$.\n\n1.  **Completeness:** A Riemannian manifold is complete if every geodesic can be extended to be defined for all time $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In our case, the parallel vector field $X$ has constant length $\\|X\\|^2 = g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}) = 1$. An integral curve of a unit-length parallel vector field is a geodesic parametrized by arc length. We showed in Part 2 that the integral curve (geodesic) $\\gamma(s) = (\\theta_0, s+t_0)$ is only defined for $s$ in a finite interval, specifically $s \\in (-t_0, 1-t_0)$. Since these geodesics cannot be extended for all $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the manifold $(M,g)$ is geodesically incomplete. The incompleteness of the flow of $X$ is a direct manifestation of the incompleteness of the manifold itself.\n\n2.  **Simple-Connectedness:** The manifold $M = \\mathbb{S}^1 \\times (0,1)$ is homotopy equivalent to the circle $\\mathbb{S}^1$. Its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{S}^1) = \\mathbb{Z}$, which is not the trivial group. Therefore, $M$ is not simply connected.\n\nThe de Rham decomposition theorem cannot be applied to $(M,g)$ because it fails to satisfy both the completeness and the simple-connectedness hypotheses. The question specifically directs us to focus on the incompleteness of the flow of $X$. If $(M,g)$ were to admit a global splitting into $N \\times \\mathbb{R}$ for some manifold $N$, this would imply the existence of a complete geodesic flow in the $\\mathbb{R}$ direction. The parallel vector field $X$ corresponds to this direction, but its flow (and thus its geodesics) is incomplete. This incompleteness, caused by the fact that the manifold is defined on the open interval $(0,1)$ rather than the entire real line $\\mathbb{R}$, is the fundamental obstruction that prevents the local product structure from extending to a global splitting of the form $N \\times \\mathbb{R}$. The manifold's \"edge\" at $t=0$ and $t=1$ terminates the geodesics in finite time.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}$$", "id": "3053990"}]}
