We will proceed with the solution, which is divided into two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Sectional Curvature under Metric Scaling**\n\nThe first task is to determine how the sectional curvature transforms under a constant scaling of the metric. We are given a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ and a new metric $\\tilde{g} = c g$ for some constant $c0$. We will determine the sectional curvature $K_{\\tilde{g}}$ for the metric $\\tilde{g}$ in terms of the sectional curvature $K_g$ for the metric $g$. This will be done by systematically analyzing the effect of the scaling on the Levi-Civita connection, the Riemann curvature tensor, and finally the sectional curvature itself, starting from their fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be arbitrary vector fields on $M$. Let $\\nabla$ and $\\tilde{\\nabla}$ be the Levi-Civita connections associated with $g$ and $\\tilde{g}$ respectively. The Koszul formula for $\\tilde{\\nabla}$ is given by:\n$$\n2 \\tilde{g}(\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y, Z) = X(\\tilde{g}(Y,Z)) + Y(\\tilde{g}(X,Z)) - Z(\\tilde{g}(X,Y)) + \\tilde{g}([X,Y], Z) - \\tilde{g}([X,Z], Y) - \\tilde{g}([Y,Z], X)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\tilde{g} = c g$ into this formula, and using the fact that $c$ is a constant so its Lie derivative with respect to any vector field is zero (e.g., $X(c)=0$), we get:\n$$\n2 c g(\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y, Z) = X(c g(Y,Z)) + Y(c g(X,Z)) - Z(c g(X,Y)) + c g([X,Y], Z) - c g([X,Z], Y) - c g([Y,Z], X)\n$$\n$$\n2 c g(\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y, Z) = c \\left[ X(g(Y,Z)) + Y(g(X,Z)) - Z(g(X,Y)) + g([X,Y], Z) - g([X,Z], Y) - g([Y,Z], X) \\right]\n$$\nThe expression in the square brackets is precisely $2 g(\\nabla_X Y, Z)$ from the Koszul formula for the connection $\\nabla$. Therefore, we have:\n$$\n2 c g(\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y, Z) = c \\left[ 2 g(\\nabla_X Y, Z) \\right]\n$$\nSince $c  0$, we can divide by $2c$ to obtain:\n$$\ng(\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y, Z) = g(\\nabla_X Y, Z)\n$$\nAs this equality holds for all vector fields $Z$ and the metric $g$ is non-degenerate, we conclude that the connections are identical:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y = \\nabla_X Y\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the Levi-Civita connection is invariant under a constant scaling of the metric.\n\nNext, we examine the Riemann curvature tensor. Let $R$ and $\\tilde{R}$ be the curvature tensors for $g$ and $\\tilde{g}$, respectively. The curvature tensor is defined in terms of the connection as:\n$$\n\\tilde{R}(X,Y)Z = \\tilde{\\nabla}_X \\tilde{\\nabla}_Y Z - \\tilde{\\nabla}_Y \\tilde{\\nabla}_X Z - \\tilde{\\nabla}_{[X,Y]} Z\n$$\nSince we have shown that $\\tilde{\\nabla} = \\nabla$, we can directly substitute $\\nabla$ into the expression for $\\tilde{R}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{R}(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]} Z = R(X,Y)Z\n$$\nThis shows that the Riemann curvature tensor, viewed as a $(1,3)$-tensor field, is also invariant under a constant scaling of the metric.\n\nFinally, we can compute the sectional curvature $K_{\\tilde{g}}(\\sigma)$ for a $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p M$ spanned by linearly independent vectors $X, Y \\in T_p M$. Using the provided definition:\n$$\nK_{\\tilde{g}}(\\sigma) = \\frac{\\tilde{g}(\\tilde{R}(X,Y)Y, X)}{\\tilde{g}(X,X)\\tilde{g}(Y,Y) - \\tilde{g}(X,Y)^2}\n$$\nWe now substitute $\\tilde{g} = c g$ and $\\tilde{R}(X,Y)Y = R(X,Y)Y$:\n$$\nK_{\\tilde{g}}(\\sigma) = \\frac{c g(R(X,Y)Y, X)}{(c g(X,X))(c g(Y,Y)) - (c g(X,Y))^2}\n$$\nFactoring out the constants from the denominator:\n$$\nK_{\\tilde{g}}(\\sigma) = \\frac{c g(R(X,Y)Y, X)}{c^2 g(X,X)g(Y,Y) - c^2 g(X,Y)^2} = \\frac{c g(R(X,Y)Y, X)}{c^2 \\left( g(X,X)g(Y,Y) - g(X,Y)^2 \\right)}\n$$\nSimplifying the factor of $c$:\n$$\nK_{\\tilde{g}}(\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{c} \\left( \\frac{g(R(X,Y)Y, X)}{g(X,X)g(Y,Y) - g(X,Y)^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe term in the parentheses is the definition of the sectional curvature $K_g(\\sigma)$. Thus, we arrive at the desired relationship:\n$$\nK_{\\tilde{g}}(\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{c} K_g(\\sigma)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Curvature of the Sphere $S^n(r)$**\n\nThe second task is to apply the previous result to find the constant sectional curvature of the sphere $S^n(r)$ of radius $r0$ embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We are given that the standard round metric $g_{\\mathrm{round}}$ on $S^n$ is normalized to have constant sectional curvature $K_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}} \\equiv 1$. This corresponds to the metric induced on the unit sphere $S^n(1) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \\|x\\| = 1\\}$. Let us denote this metric by $g_1$. So, $g_{\\mathrm{round}} = g_1$.\n\nWe need to show that the metric $g_r$ induced on $S^n(r) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \\|x\\| = r\\}$ is related to $g_{\\mathrm{round}}$ by $g_r = r^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}}$. This equality is to be understood in the context of the natural diffeomorphism between $S^n(1)$ and $S^n(r)$. Consider the scaling map $\\phi: S^n(1) \\to S^n(r)$ defined by $\\phi(p) = r p$. This is a diffeomorphism. For any $p \\in S^n(1)$ and tangent vectors $X, Y \\in T_p S^n(1)$, the pullback of the metric $g_r$ by $\\phi$ is given by:\n$$\n(\\phi^* g_r)_p(X, Y) = (g_r)_{\\phi(p)}(d\\phi_p(X), d\\phi_p(Y))\n$$\nSince $\\phi$ is a linear map in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, its derivative is $d\\phi_p(X) = rX$. The induced metrics $g_r$ and $g_1$ are simply the restriction of the Euclidean inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ to the respective tangent spaces. So we have:\n$$\n(\\phi^* g_r)_p(X, Y) = (g_r)_{rp}(rX, rY) = \\langle rX, rY \\rangle = r^2 \\langle X, Y \\rangle = r^2 (g_1)_p(X, Y)\n$$\nSince $p$, $X$, and $Y$ were arbitrary, this shows that $\\phi^* g_r = r^2 g_1 = r^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}}$. This means that the Riemannian manifold $(S^n(r), g_r)$ is isometric to $(S^n, r^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}})$.\n\nSince sectional curvature is an isometric invariant, the sectional curvature of $(S^n(r), g_r)$ is the same as that of $(S^n, r^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}})$. We can now use the result from Part 1 to find the curvature of $(S^n, r^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}})$.\nLet $g = g_{\\mathrm{round}}$ and $\\tilde{g} = r^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}}$. The scaling constant is $c = r^2$.\nThe sectional curvature of the new metric $\\tilde{g}$ is:\n$$\nK_{\\tilde{g}} = \\frac{1}{c} K_g\n$$\nSubstituting the identified terms:\n$$\nK_{r^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}}} = \\frac{1}{r^2} K_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}}\n$$\nWe are given that $K_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}} \\equiv 1$. Therefore,\n$$\nK_{r^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}}} \\equiv \\frac{1}{r^2}\n$$\nBy isometry, the constant sectional curvature of the sphere $S^n(r)$ with its induced metric $g_r$ is this same value.\n$$\nK_{g_r} \\equiv \\frac{1}{r^2}\n$$\n\nThe two required expressions are the general scaling law for sectional curvature and the specific curvature for a sphere of radius $r$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{c} K_{g}(\\sigma)  \\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3042418"}, {"introduction": "The power of sectional curvature bounds comes from comparing a general manifold to model spaces of constant curvature.

For any such space, the curvature tensor $R$ is given by the formula:\n$$R(X,Y)Z = K(\\langle Y, Z \\rangle X - \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y)$$\nfor vector fields $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.\n\nThe Jacobi field $J(t)$ evolves according to the Jacobi equation:\n$$J''(t) + R\\big(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\big)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0$$\nHere, $J''(t)$ denotes the second covariant derivative of $J$ along $\\gamma$, i.e., $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J$. To simplify the curvature term $R\\big(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\big)\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, we let $X = J(t)$, $Y = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, and $Z = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. Substituting into the formula for the curvature tensor, we get:\n$$R\\big(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\big)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = K\\Big(\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle J(t) - \\langle J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\Big)$$\n\nWe are given several key pieces of information:\n1. The geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is unit-speed, which means $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|^2 = 1$ for all $t$.\n2. The Jacobi field $J(t)$ is a normal field, which means it is orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector at all times: $\\langle J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t$.\n3. The sectional curvature is constant $K = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the curvature term gives a significant simplification:\n$$R\\big(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\big)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 1 \\cdot \\Big(1 \\cdot J(t) - 0 \\cdot \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\Big) = J(t)$$\n\nThus, the Jacobi equation reduces to the following second-order linear ordinary differential equation for the vector field $J(t)$:\n$$J''(t) + J(t) = 0$$\n\nTo solve this vector-valued ODE, we can express $J(t)$ in a parallel orthonormal frame $\\{E_2(t), \\dots, E_n(t)\\}$ for the normal bundle along $\\gamma(t)$. Let $J(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^n j_i(t) E_i(t)$, where $j_i(t)$ are scalar functions. Since the frame fields $E_i(t)$ are parallel transported ($\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}E_i = 0$), the covariant derivatives of $J(t)$ are simply the ordinary derivatives of its components: $J'(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^n j_i'(t) E_i(t)$ and $J''(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^n j_i''(t) E_i(t)$. The Jacobi equation then separates into $n-1$ independent scalar equations:\n$$j_i''(t) + j_i(t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i = 2, \\dots, n$$\nThe general solution for each component is $j_i(t) = a_i \\cos(t) + b_i \\sin(t)$, where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are constants.\n\nWe use the initial conditions to determine these constants.\n1. $J(0) = 0$: This implies $j_i(0)=0$ for all $i$.\n   $j_i(0) = a_i \\cos(0) + b_i \\sin(0) = a_i$. Thus, $a_i = 0$ for all $i$.\n   The solution for each component simplifies to $j_i(t) = b_i \\sin(t)$.\n\n2. $J'(0) = V$: We are given that $V$ is a nonzero vector orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$. Let the components of $V$ in the basis $\\{E_2(0), \\dots, E_n(0)\\}$ be $v_i$, so $V = \\sum_{i=2}^n v_i E_i(0)$.\n   The derivative of $J(t)$ is $J'(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^n j_i'(t) E_i(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^n (b_i \\cos(t)) E_i(t)$.\n   At $t=0$, we have $J'(0) = \\sum_{i=2}^n (b_i \\cos(0)) E_i(0) = \\sum_{i=2}^n b_i E_i(0)$.\n   Comparing this with $J'(0) = V$, we find that $b_i = v_i$.\n\nTherefore, the components of the Jacobi field are $j_i(t) = v_i \\sin(t)$. Reconstructing the vector field $J(t)$, we get:\n$$J(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^n \\big(v_i \\sin(t)\\big) E_i(t) = \\sin(t) \\sum_{i=2}^n v_i E_i(t)$$\nThe vector field $V(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^n v_i E_i(t)$ is the parallel transport of the initial vector $V = J'(0)$ along $\\gamma$. So, the explicit form of the Jacobi field is $J(t) = \\sin(t) V(t)$.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to find the first positive time $t  0$ for which there exists a nontrivial normal Jacobi field $J$ that vanishes at both $t=0$ and at this time. Such a time defines the first conjugate time to $t=0$ along $\\gamma$.\n\nWe have already imposed the condition $J(0)=0$. We now seek the smallest $t  0$ such that $J(t)=0$ for a nontrivial field. A nontrivial Jacobi field requires that its initial conditions are not both zero. Since $J(0)=0$, this means we must have $J'(0) = V \\neq 0$.\nThe condition $J(t)=0$ becomes:\n$$\\sin(t) V(t) = 0$$\nSince $V$ is a nonzero vector and $V(t)$ is its parallel transport, $V(t)$ is never the zero vector. Therefore, the equation can only be satisfied if the scalar factor $\\sin(t)$ is zero:\n$$\\sin(t) = 0$$\nThe solutions for $t$ are $t = k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. We are looking for the smallest *positive* time, so we must have $k  0$. The smallest such integer is $k=1$.\n\nThe first conjugate time is therefore $t = \\pi$. At this time, any Jacobi field originating at $\\gamma(0)$ with $J(0)=0$ will vanish again, regardless of its initial derivative $J'(0)=V$. This corresponds to the fact that on a unit sphere, all geodesics (great circles) starting from a point $\\gamma(0)$ reconverge at the antipodal point $\\gamma(\\pi)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi}$$", "id": "3042406"}]}
