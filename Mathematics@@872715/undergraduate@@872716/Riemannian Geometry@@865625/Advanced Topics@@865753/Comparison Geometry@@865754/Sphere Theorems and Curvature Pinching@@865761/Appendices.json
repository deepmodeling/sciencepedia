The derivation must proceed from the definitions of the shape operator and the second fundamental form, and utilize the Gauss equation for a hypersurface.\n\nFirst, we characterize the geometry of the sphere $S^{n}(R)$. A point $p \\in S^{n}(R)$ can be identified with its position vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, which we also denote by $p$. By definition, the sphere is the set of points satisfying $\\langle p, p \\rangle = R^2$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the standard Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The tangent space $T_{p}S^{n}(R)$ at a point $p$ consists of all vectors $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that are orthogonal to $p$, i.e., $\\langle X, p \\rangle = 0$. The outward-pointing unit normal vector field $N$ is given by $N(p) = \\frac{p}{R}$ for any $p \\in S^{n}(R)$. The metric $g$ on $S^{n}(R)$ is the one induced by the Euclidean metric, so for any two tangent vectors $X, Y \\in T_pS^n(R)$, their inner product is $g(X, Y) = \\langle X, Y \\rangle$.\n\nThe shape operator $S$ at a point $p$ is a linear map $S_p: T_pS^n(R) \\to T_pS^n(R)$ defined by the Weingarten equation: $S(X) = -\\bar{\\nabla}_X N$. Here, $\\bar{\\nabla}$ is the Levi-Civita connection on the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and $X$ is a tangent vector field on $S^{n}(R)$. In Euclidean space, $\\bar{\\nabla}_X N$ is simply the directional derivative of the vector field $N$ in the direction of $X$. We can extend $N$ to be a vector field in a neighborhood of $S^{n}(R)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ by setting $N(q) = q/\\|q\\|$, but for the purpose of computing the derivative at $p \\in S^n(R)$ along a vector $X \\in T_pS^n(R)$, we can consider a curve $c(t)$ on the sphere such that $c(0) = p$ and $c'(0) = X$. Then,\n$$\n\\bar{\\nabla}_X N \\big|_p = \\frac{d}{dt}\\Big|_{t=0} N(c(t))\n$$\nSince $c(t) \\in S^n(R)$ for all $t$ in some interval around $0$, we have $N(c(t)) = \\frac{c(t)}{R}$. The derivative is then:\n$$\n\\bar{\\nabla}_X N \\big|_p = \\frac{d}{dt}\\Big|_{t=0} \\frac{c(t)}{R} = \\frac{c'(0)}{R} = \\frac{X}{R}\n$$\nThus, the shape operator is given by:\n$$\nS(X) = -\\frac{X}{R}\n$$\nThis shows that the shape operator is a scalar multiplication by $-1/R$. The principal curvatures are all equal to $1/R$.\n\nThe second fundamental form, denoted $I\\!I$, is a symmetric bilinear form on the tangent space $T_pS^n(R)$ defined in terms of the shape operator as $I\\!I(X, Y) = g(S(X), Y)$. Using our expression for $S(X)$:\n$$\nI\\!I(X, Y) = g\\left(-\\frac{X}{R}, Y\\right) = -\\frac{1}{R} g(X, Y)\n$$\n\nThe sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)$ of a $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_pS^n(R)$ is given by the Gauss equation. For a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, this equation relates the curvature of the hypersurface to the curvature of the ambient space and the second fundamental form. The equation is:\n$$\nK(\\sigma) = \\bar{K}(\\sigma) + \\det(I\\!I|_\\sigma)\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{K}(\\sigma)$ is the sectional curvature of the plane $\\sigma$ viewed as a plane in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and $\\det(I\\!I|_\\sigma)$ is the determinant of the second fundamental form restricted to the plane $\\sigma$. The ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is flat, so its sectional curvature $\\bar{K}$ is identically zero for any plane. Therefore, $\\bar{K}(\\sigma) = 0$.\n\nTo compute $\\det(I\\!I|_\\sigma)$, let $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for the $2$-plane $\\sigma$. This means $g(e_1, e_1) = 1$, $g(e_2, e_2) = 1$, and $g(e_1, e_2) = 0$.

First, we derive the transformation law for sectional curvature under a constant scaling of the metric. Second, we use this law to determine the pinching constant of the rescaled metric.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Sectional Curvature Scaling Law\n\nLet $\\left(M^{n},g\\right)$ be a Riemannian manifold and let $g' = c^{2}g$ be a new metric, where $c0$ is a constant. We denote the inner product associated with $g$ by $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_g$ and the one associated with $g'$ by $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_{g'}$. By definition, for any two vector fields $X, Y$, we have $\\langle X, Y \\rangle_{g'} = c^{2} \\langle X, Y \\rangle_g$.\n\nWe begin by determining the relationship between the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ of $g$ and the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla'$ of $g'$. We use the Koszul formula. For any vector fields $X, Y, Z$, the connection $\\nabla'$ is uniquely defined by:\n$$\n2 \\langle \\nabla'_{X}Y, Z \\rangle_{g'} = X\\langle Y, Z \\rangle_{g'} + Y\\langle X, Z \\rangle_{g'} - Z\\langle X, Y \\rangle_{g'} + \\langle [X,Y], Z \\rangle_{g'} - \\langle [X,Z], Y \\rangle_{g'} - \\langle [Y,Z], X \\rangle_{g'}\n$$\nWe substitute $\\langle U, V \\rangle_{g'} = c^{2} \\langle U, V \\rangle_g$ into the formula. Since $c$ is a constant, its derivative along any vector field is zero, i.e., $X(c^{2}) = 0$.\n$$\n2 c^{2} \\langle \\nabla'_{X}Y, Z \\rangle_{g} = X(c^{2} \\langle Y, Z \\rangle_g) + Y(c^{2} \\langle X, Z \\rangle_g) - Z(c^{2} \\langle X, Y \\rangle_g) + c^{2}\\langle [X,Y], Z \\rangle_{g} - c^{2}\\langle [X,Z], Y \\rangle_{g} - c^{2}\\langle [Y,Z], X \\rangle_{g}\n$$\n$$\n2 c^{2} \\langle \\nabla'_{X}Y, Z \\rangle_{g} = c^{2} \\left( X\\langle Y, Z \\rangle_g + Y\\langle X, Z \\rangle_g - Z\\langle X, Y \\rangle_g + \\langle [X,Y], Z \\rangle_{g} - \\langle [X,Z], Y \\rangle_{g} - \\langle [Y,Z], X \\rangle_{g} \\right)\n$$\nThe expression in the parenthesis is precisely $2 \\langle \\nabla_{X}Y, Z \\rangle_g$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n2 c^{2} \\langle \\nabla'_{X}Y, Z \\rangle_{g} = c^{2} (2 \\langle \\nabla_{X}Y, Z \\rangle_g)\n$$\nDividing by $2c^{2}$ (since $c0$), we get $\\langle \\nabla'_{X}Y, Z \\rangle_{g} = \\langle \\nabla_{X}Y, Z \\rangle_g$. As this holds for any vector field $Z$, it implies that $\\nabla'_{X}Y = \\nabla_{X}Y$. The Levi-Civita connection is invariant under a constant rescaling of the metric.\n\nNext, we find the relationship between the Riemann curvature tensors, $R$ for $g$ and $R'$ for $g'$. The Riemann curvature tensor is defined by $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]} Z$. For the metric $g'$, the tensor $R'$ is:\n$$\nR'(X,Y)Z = \\nabla'_{X} \\nabla'_{Y} Z - \\nabla'_{Y} \\nabla'_{X} Z - \\nabla'_{[X,Y]} Z\n$$\nSince we found that $\\nabla' = \\nabla$, we can directly substitute this into the expression for $R'$:\n$$\nR'(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_{X} \\nabla_{Y} Z - \\nabla_{Y} \\nabla_{X} Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]} Z = R(X,Y)Z\n$$\nThis shows that the Riemann curvature tensor, viewed as a $(1,3)$-tensor, is also invariant under constant metric rescaling.\n\nNow we can compute the sectional curvature $K_{g'}(\\sigma)$ for a $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_pM$ spanned by non-zero tangent vectors $u, v \\in T_pM$.\n$$\nK_{g'}(\\sigma) = \\frac{\\langle R'(u,v)v, u \\rangle_{g'}}{\\langle u,u \\rangle_{g'} \\langle v,v \\rangle_{g'} - \\langle u,v \\rangle_{g'}^{2}}\n$$\nWe substitute the relationships we have found: $R'(u,v)v = R(u,v)v$ and $\\langle U, V \\rangle_{g'} = c^{2} \\langle U, V \\rangle_g$.\nThe numerator becomes:\n$$\n\\langle R'(u,v)v, u \\rangle_{g'} = \\langle R(u,v)v, u \\rangle_{g'} = c^{2} \\langle R(u,v)v, u \\rangle_{g}\n$$\nThe denominator becomes:\n$$\n\\langle u,u \\rangle_{g'} \\langle v,v \\rangle_{g'} - \\langle u,v \\rangle_{g'}^{2} = (c^{2} \\langle u,u \\rangle_g) (c^{2} \\langle v,v \\rangle_g) - (c^{2} \\langle u,v \\rangle_g)^{2} = c^{4} \\left( \\langle u,u \\rangle_g \\langle v,v \\rangle_g - \\langle u,v \\rangle_g^2 \\right)\n$$\nCombining the numerator and denominator:\n$$\nK_{g'}(\\sigma) = \\frac{c^{2} \\langle R(u,v)v, u \\rangle_{g}}{c^{4} \\left( \\langle u,u \\rangle_g \\langle v,v \\rangle_g - \\langle u,v \\rangle_g^2 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{c^{2}} \\frac{\\langle R(u,v)v, u \\rangle_{g}}{\\langle u,u \\rangle_g \\langle v,v \\rangle_g - \\langle u,v \\rangle_g^2}\n$$\nThe second fraction is the definition of the sectional curvature $K_g(\\sigma)$. Therefore, we have explicitly verified the scaling law:\n$$\nK_{c^{2} g}(\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{c^{2}} K_{g}(\\sigma)\n$$\n\nPart 2: Determination of the Pinching Constant\n\nWe are given that the sectional curvatures of the metric $g$ satisfy the bounds $0  \\alpha \\le K_g(\\sigma) \\le \\beta$ for all $2$-planes $\\sigma$.\nUsing the scaling law derived above, the sectional curvatures $K_{g'}(\\sigma)$ of the rescaled metric $g' = c^2 g$ satisfy:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c^2} \\alpha \\le \\frac{1}{c^2} K_g(\\sigma) \\le \\frac{1}{c^2} \\beta\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{c^2} \\le K_{g'}(\\sigma) \\le \\frac{\\beta}{c^2}\n$$\nThe maximal sectional curvature for the metric $g'$ is $\\sup_{\\sigma} K_{g'}(\\sigma)$.
