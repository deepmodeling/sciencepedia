The Lie group $T^n$ is an abelian (commutative) group because its operation is componentwise addition, which is commutative. A fundamental theorem in Lie theory states that a Lie group is abelian if and only if its Lie algebra is abelian. The calculation performed is an explicit verification of this principle for the specific case of the $n$-torus.
