It is a standard, well-posed problem in differential geometry. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe Lie derivative of a smooth function $f$ along a smooth vector field $X$, denoted $L_{X}f$, can be defined in terms of the flow of $X$. Let $\\phi_{t}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the flow generated by the vector field $X$. The flow $\\phi_{t}(p)$ describes the position at time $t$ of a particle that starts at point $p$ at time $t=0$ and moves along the integral curve of $X$. The Lie derivative of $f$ at a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is then given by the rate of change of $f$ along this curve at $t=0$:\n$$\n(L_{X}f)(p) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} f(\\phi_{t}(p))\n$$\n\nFirst, we must compute the flow $\\phi_{t}$ of the vector field $X = x^{1}\\partial_{1}$. An integral curve $\\gamma(t) = (x^{1}(t), \\dots, x^{n}(t))$ of $X$ must satisfy the system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\gamma(t)}{dt} = X_{\\gamma(t)}\n$$\nIn coordinates, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dx^{i}(t)}{dt} = X^{i}(\\gamma(t))\n$$\nFor the given vector field $X = x^{1}\\partial_{1}$, the components are $X^{1} = x^{1}$ and $X^{i} = 0$ for $i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}$. The system of ODEs is therefore:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dx^{1}}{dt} &= x^{1} \\\\\n\\frac{dx^{i}}{dt} &= 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}\n\\end{align*}\nLet the initial point at $t=0$ be $p = (p^{1}, \\dots, p^{n})$. We solve this system with the initial conditions $x^{i}(0) = p^{i}$.\n\nThe first equation, $\\frac{dx^{1}}{dt} = x^{1}$, is a separable first-order linear ODE. Its solution is $x^{1}(t) = C e^{t}$ for some constant $C$. Using the initial condition $x^{1}(0) = p^{1}$, we find $p^{1} = C e^{0}$, which implies $C=p^{1}$. Thus, the solution is:\n$$\nx^{1}(t) = p^{1}e^{t}\n$$\nThe remaining equations, $\\frac{dx^{i}}{dt} = 0$ for $i \\geq 2$, integrate to $x^{i}(t) = \\text{constant}$. Using the initial conditions $x^{i}(0) = p^{i}$, we find that the constant is $p^{i}$. Thus:\n$$\nx^{i}(t) = p^{i} \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}\n$$\nThe flow $\\phi_{t}$ maps the starting point $p$ to the point on the integral curve at time $t$. Therefore, the flow is given by:\n$$\n\\phi_{t}(p^{1}, \\dots, p^{n}) = (p^{1}e^{t}, p^{2}, \\dots, p^{n})\n$$\nTo make the notation consistent with the problem statement, we use $x = (x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ as the arbitrary point in the manifold instead of $p$. The flow is $\\phi_{t}(x) = (x^{1}e^{t}, x^{2}, \\dots, x^{n})$.\n\nNow we can compute the Lie derivative $L_{X}f$. We evaluate the function $f(x)=x^{1}x^{2}$ along the flow:\n$$\nf(\\phi_{t}(x)) = f(x^{1}e^{t}, x^{2}, \\dots, x^{n})\n$$\nAccording to the definition of $f$, this becomes:\n$$\nf(\\phi_{t}(x)) = (x^{1}e^{t})x^{2} = x^{1}x^{2}e^{t}\n$$\nNext, we differentiate this expression with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} f(\\phi_{t}(x)) = \\frac{d}{dt} (x^{1}x^{2}e^{t}) = x^{1}x^{2} \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{t}) = x^{1}x^{2}e^{t}\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate this derivative at $t=0$:\n$$\n(L_{X}f)(x) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} f(\\phi_{t}(x)) = x^{1}x^{2}e^{0} = x^{1}x^{2}\n$$\nThus, the Lie derivative of $f(x)=x^{1}x^{2}$ along the vector field $X=x^{1}\\partial_{1}$ is the function $x^{1}x^{2}$.\n\nIt is useful to note that for a scalar function, the Lie derivative is equivalent to the directional derivative: $L_{X}f = X(f)$. We can verify our result using this alternative definition:\n$$\nL_{X}f = X(f) = (x^{1}\\partial_{1})(x^{1}x^{2}) = x^{1}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{1}}(x^{1}x^{2})\\right) = x^{1}(1 \\cdot x^{2}) = x^{1}x^{2}\n$$\nThe result is consistent.\n\n**Geometric Interpretation:**\nThe Lie derivative $L_{X}f$ at a point $x$ measures the instantaneous rate of change of the function $f$ as one moves away from $x$ along the integral curve of the vector field $X$. The integral curves of $X=x^{1}\\partial_{1}$ are trajectories where particles move parallel to the $x^1$-axis with a velocity proportional to their $x^1$-coordinate. Points on the hyperplane $x^{1}=0$ are fixed points. Points with $x^{1}>0$ move in the positive $x^{1}$ direction, and points with $x^{1}<0$ move in the negative $x^{1}$ direction, both accelerating away from the $x^{1}=0$ hyperplane.\n\nOur result, $L_{X}f = x^{1}x^{2}$, shows that the rate of change of the function $f$ along these flow lines is equal to the value of the function $f$ itself. This implies an exponential-like behavior for the value of $f$ along an integral curve. Let $g(t) = f(\\phi_{t}(x))$ be the value of $f$ along the flow line starting at $x$. We found that $\\frac{dg}{dt} \\Big|_{t=0} = (L_{X}f)(x) = f(x) = g(0)$. More generally, at any point $\\gamma(t) = \\phi_t(x)$ along the curve, the rate of change is $\\frac{dg}{dt} (t) = (L_X f)(\\gamma(t))$. In our case, $(L_X f)(\\gamma(t)) = (x^1e^t)(x^2) = f(\\gamma(t)) = g(t)$. So we have the differential equation $\\frac{dg}{dt} = g(t)$, whose solution is $g(t) = g(0) e^t$. This means the value of the function $f$ grows or decays exponentially along the flow lines of $X$, and the rate of this change at any point is simply the value of the function at that point.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x^{1}x^{2}}\n$$", "id": "3056207"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the Lie derivative for functions, we now advance to differential forms.

Applying this to $f = \\iota_{X}\\eta$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}(\\iota_{X}\\eta) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\eta_{i}X^{i}\\right)dx^{k} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\eta_{i}}{\\partial x^{k}}X^{i} + \\eta_{i}\\frac{\\partial X^{i}}{\\partial x^{k}}\\right)dx^{k} $$\nRelabeling the outer summation index from $k$ to $j$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}(\\iota_{X}\\eta) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(X^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\eta_{i}}{\\partial x^{j}} + \\eta_{i}\\frac{\\partial X^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right)dx^{j} $$\n\nThe second term is $\\iota_{X}(\\mathrm{d}\\eta)$. First, we compute the exterior derivative of $\\eta$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}\\eta = \\mathrm{d}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\eta_{i}dx^{i}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathrm{d}\\eta_{i} \\wedge dx^{i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{\\partial \\eta_{i}}{\\partial x^{k}}dx^{k}\\right) \\wedge dx^{i} = \\sum_{k,i=1}^{n}\\frac{\\partial \\eta_{i}}{\\partial x^{k}}dx^{k} \\wedge dx^{i} $$\nNow we apply the interior product with $X$. We use the property $\\iota_{V}(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = (\\iota_{V}\\alpha)\\wedge\\beta - \\alpha\\wedge(\\iota_{V}\\beta)$ where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are $1$-forms and $V$ is a vector field.

For the $j$-th component $(L_{X}\\eta)_{j}$:\n$$ (L_{X}\\eta)_{j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(X^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\eta_{i}}{\\partial x^{j}} + \\eta_{i}\\frac{\\partial X^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(X^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\eta_{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} - X^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\eta_{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right) $$\nThe first and last parts cancel: $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\eta_{i}}{\\partial x^{j}} - \\sum_{i=1}^{n}X^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\eta_{i}}{\\partial x^{j}} = 0$.

The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It is a substantive problem that tests the foundational definitions of Lie brackets and Lie derivatives, as well as their interrelationship (Cartan's formula and the commutator identity).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution is warranted.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing each of the three tasks in order.\n\nFirst, we compute the Lie bracket $[X,Y]$. By definition, the Lie bracket is a vector field whose action on any smooth function $f \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$ is given by $[X,Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f))$.\nLet's compute the two terms separately.\nThe action of $Y$ on $f$ is:\n$$Y(f) = (y\\,\\partial_{y})(f(x,y)) = y \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$$\nNow, we apply $X$ to the resulting function $Y(f)$:\n$$X(Y(f)) = (x\\,\\partial_{x})\\left(y \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(y \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)$$\nSince $y$ is an independent coordinate with respect to $x$, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} = 0$. Applying the product rule for differentiation is unnecessary but illustrative: $x \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right)\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)\\right) = x \\left(0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + y \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\right) = xy \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}$.\nSimilarly, we compute the second term, $Y(X(f))$. The action of $X$ on $f$ is:\n$$X(f) = (x\\,\\partial_{x})(f(x,y)) = x \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$$\nApplying $Y$ to the function $X(f)$:\n$$Y(X(f)) = (y\\,\\partial_{y})\\left(x \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right) = y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(x \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right) = yx \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x}$$\nBy the symmetry of second derivatives for smooth functions (Clairaut's theorem), we have $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x}$.\nTherefore, the action of the Lie bracket on $f$ is:\n$$[X,Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f)) = xy \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} - yx \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = xy \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x}\\right) = 0$$\nSince $[X,Y](f) = 0$ for any arbitrary smooth function $f$, the Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ must be the zero vector field. In coordinates, this is $[X,Y] = 0\\,\\partial_x + 0\\,\\partial_y = 0$.\n\nSecond, we provide the geometric interpretation of this result. The Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ of two vector fields measures the infinitesimal failure of their corresponding flows to commute. Let $\\Phi_{t}^{X}$ be the flow of $X$ and $\\Phi_{s}^{Y}$ be the flow of $Y$. A vanishing Lie bracket, $[X,Y]=0$, is the necessary and sufficient condition for the flows to commute, i.e., $\\Phi_{t}^{X} \\circ \\Phi_{s}^{Y} = \\Phi_{s}^{Y} \\circ \\Phi_{t}^{X}$ for all $s,t$ for which the flows are defined.\nTo see this explicitly, we can compute the flows.\nThe flow of $X=x\\,\\partial_x$ is the solution to the ODEs $\\frac{dx}{dt} = x$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$. Integrating gives $x(t) = x_0 e^t$ and $y(t) = y_0$. So, $\\Phi_{t}^{X}(x_0, y_0) = (x_0 e^t, y_0)$.\nThe flow of $Y=y\\,\\partial_y$ is the solution to $\\frac{dx}{ds} = 0$ and $\\frac{dy}{ds} = y$. Integrating gives $x(s) = x_0$ and $y(s) = y_0 e^s$. So, $\\Phi_{s}^{Y}(x_0, y_0) = (x_0, y_0 e^s)$.\nNow we compose the flows:\n$$(\\Phi_{t}^{X} \\circ \\Phi_{s}^{Y})(x_0, y_0) = \\Phi_{t}^{X}(x_0, y_0 e^s) = (x_0 e^t, y_0 e^s)$$\n$$(\\Phi_{s}^{Y} \\circ \\Phi_{t}^{X})(x_0, y_0) = \\Phi_{s}^{Y}(x_0 e^t, y_0) = (x_0 e^t, y_0 e^s)$$\nThe results are identical, confirming that the flows commute. Geometrically, scaling the plane in the $x$-direction and then in the $y$-direction yields the same result as scaling in the $y$-direction first and then in the $x$-direction.\n\nThird, we evaluate $(\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\mathcal{L}_{Y} - \\mathcal{L}_{Y}\\mathcal{L}_{X})\\alpha$ for $\\alpha = x\\,\\mathrm{d}y - y\\,\\mathrm{d}x$. The problem requires using foundational relationships, namely Cartan's magic formula: $\\mathcal{L}_V \\omega = i_V(d\\omega) + d(i_V \\omega)$, where $i_V$ is the interior product (contraction) with respect to the vector field $V$.\nWe first compute the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$:\n$$d\\alpha = d(x\\,\\mathrm{d}y - y\\,\\mathrm{d}x) = d(x\\,\\mathrm{d}y) - d(y\\,\\mathrm{d}x) = (\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) - (\\mathrm{d}y \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x) = \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - (-\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) = 2\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y$$\nNow, we compute $\\mathcal{L}_Y \\alpha$ using Cartan's formula with $V = Y = y\\,\\partial_y$.\nThe first term is $d(i_Y \\alpha)$:\n$$i_Y \\alpha = i_{y\\partial_y}(x\\,\\mathrm{d}y - y\\,\\mathrm{d}x) = x \\cdot i_{y\\partial_y}(\\mathrm{d}y) - y \\cdot i_{y\\partial_y}(\\mathrm{d}x) = x \\cdot \\mathrm{d}y(y\\partial_y) - y \\cdot \\mathrm{d}x(y\\partial_y) = x \\cdot y - y \\cdot 0 = xy$$\nSo, $d(i_Y \\alpha) = d(xy) = y\\,\\mathrm{d}x + x\\,\\mathrm{d}y$.\nThe second term is $i_Y(d\\alpha)$:\n$$i_Y(d\\alpha) = i_{y\\partial_y}(2\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) = 2(i_{y\\partial_y}(\\mathrm{d}x) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge i_{y\\partial_y}(\\mathrm{d}y)) = 2(0 \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge y) = -2y\\,\\mathrm{d}x$$\nCombining the terms gives $\\mathcal{L}_Y \\alpha$:\n$$\\mathcal{L}_Y \\alpha = d(i_Y \\alpha) + i_Y(d\\alpha) = (y\\,\\mathrm{d}x + x\\,\\mathrm{d}y) - 2y\\,\\mathrm{d}x = x\\,\\mathrm{d}y - y\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\alpha$$\nNext, we compute $\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha$ using Cartan's formula with $V = X = x\\,\\partial_x$.\nThe first term is $d(i_X \\alpha)$:\n$$i_X \\alpha = i_{x\\partial_x}(x\\,\\mathrm{d}y - y\\,\\mathrm{d}x) = x \\cdot i_{x\\partial_x}(\\mathrm{d}y) - y \\cdot i_{x\\partial_x}(\\mathrm{d}x) = x \\cdot 0 - y \\cdot x = -xy$$\nSo, $d(i_X \\alpha) = d(-xy) = -y\\,\\mathrm{d}x - x\\,\\mathrm{d}y$.\nThe second term is $i_X(d\\alpha)$:\n$$i_X(d\\alpha) = i_{x\\partial_x}(2\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) = 2(i_{x\\partial_x}(\\mathrm{d}x) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge i_{x\\partial_x}(\\mathrm{d}y)) = 2(x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge 0) = 2x\\,\\mathrm{d}y$$\nCombining the terms gives $\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha$:\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha = d(i_X \\alpha) + i_X(d\\alpha) = (-y\\,\\mathrm{d}x - x\\,\\mathrm{d}y) + 2x\\,\\mathrm{d}y = x\\,\\mathrm{d}y - y\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\alpha$$\nWe found that $\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha = \\alpha$ and $\\mathcal{L}_Y \\alpha = \\alpha$. Now we can compute the commutator:\n$$(\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\mathcal{L}_{Y} - \\mathcal{L}_{Y}\\mathcal{L}_{X})\\alpha = \\mathcal{L}_{X}(\\mathcal{L}_{Y}\\alpha) - \\mathcal{L}_{Y}(\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\alpha) = \\mathcal{L}_{X}(\\alpha) - \\mathcal{L}_{Y}(\\alpha) = \\alpha - \\alpha = 0$$\nThe result is the zero $1$-form.\nThe connection to the previously computed Lie bracket is provided by the general identity for Lie derivatives: $[\\mathcal{L}_X, \\mathcal{L}_Y] = \\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]}$, where $[\\mathcal{L}_X, \\mathcal{L}_Y]$ is the commutator $\\mathcal{L}_X \\mathcal{L}_Y - \\mathcal{L}_Y \\mathcal{L}_X$.\nApplying this to our case:\n$$(\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\mathcal{L}_{Y} - \\mathcal{L}_{Y}\\mathcal{L}_{X})\\alpha = \\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]}\\alpha$$\nSince we found $[X,Y]=0$, this becomes:\n$$\\mathcal{L}_{0}\\alpha$$\nThe Lie derivative with respect to the zero vector field is always the zero operator. Using Cartan's formula, $\\mathcal{L}_0 = i_0 d + d i_0 = 0 + 0 = 0$. Thus, $\\mathcal{L}_0 \\alpha = 0$.\nOur explicit calculation, which yielded $0$, therefore serves as a verification of the general identity $[\\mathcal{L}_X, \\mathcal{L}_Y] = \\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]}$ for this specific case.\nThe final answer required is the expression for $[X,Y]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3056307"}]}
