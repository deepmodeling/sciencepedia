This implicitly invokes Stokes' theorem (in this planar case, Green's theorem), which states that for a suitably regular $1$-form $\\alpha$ on a domain $\\Omega$ with boundary $\\partial \\Omega$, we have $\\displaystyle \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\alpha = \\int_{\\Omega} d\\alpha$. We will compute both integrals independently to verify the theorem and find the required value.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Boundary Integral $\\displaystyle \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\alpha$**\n\nThe boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ consists of three oriented line segments: from $A$ to $B$, from $B$ to $C$, and from $C$ to $A$. We parameterize each segment and compute the corresponding line integral. The total integral is the sum of the integrals over these three segments.\nThe $1$-form is $\\alpha = -\\dfrac{y}{2}\\,dx + \\dfrac{x}{2}\\,dy$.\n\n- **Segment AB**: from $A=(0,0)$ to $B=(3,1)$.\nA parameterization is $\\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t)) = (3t, t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\nThe differentials are $dx = 3\\,dt$ and $dy = 1\\,dt$.\nSubstituting into $\\alpha$:\n$\\int_{AB} \\alpha = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( -\\dfrac{t}{2}(3) + \\dfrac{3t}{2}(1) \\right) dt = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( -\\dfrac{3t}{2} + \\dfrac{3t}{2} \\right) dt = \\int_{0}^{1} 0\\,dt = 0$.\n\n- **Segment BC**: from $B=(3,1)$ to $C=(1,4)$.\nA parameterization is $\\mathbf{r}(t) = (1-t)B + tC = (1-t)(3,1) + t(1,4) = (3(1-t)+t, 1(1-t)+4t) = (3-2t, 1+3t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\nThe differentials are $dx = -2\\,dt$ and $dy = 3\\,dt$.\nSubstituting into $\\alpha$:\n$\\int_{BC} \\alpha = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( -\\dfrac{1+3t}{2}(-2) + \\dfrac{3-2t}{2}(3) \\right) dt = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( (1+3t) + \\dfrac{9-6t}{2} \\right) dt$\n$= \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( 1+3t + \\dfrac{9}{2}-3t \\right) dt = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( 1 + \\dfrac{9}{2} \\right) dt = \\int_{0}^{1} \\dfrac{11}{2}\\,dt = \\left[ \\dfrac{11}{2}t \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\dfrac{11}{2}$.\n\n- **Segment CA**: from $C=(1,4)$ to $A=(0,0)$.\nA parameterization is $\\mathbf{r}(t) = (1-t)C + tA = (1-t)(1,4) = (1-t, 4-4t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\nThe differentials are $dx = -1\\,dt$ and $dy = -4\\,dt$.\nSubstituting into $\\alpha$:\n$\\int_{CA} \\alpha = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( -\\dfrac{4-4t}{2}(-1) + \\dfrac{1-t}{2}(-4) \\right) dt = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( (2-2t) + (-2+2t) \\right) dt = \\int_{0}^{1} 0\\,dt = 0$.\n\nThe total boundary integral is the sum:\n$\\displaystyle \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\alpha = \\int_{AB} \\alpha + \\int_{BC} \\alpha + \\int_{CA} \\alpha = 0 + \\dfrac{11}{2} + 0 = \\dfrac{11}{2}$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Interior Integral $\\displaystyle \\int_{\\Omega} d\\alpha$**\n\nFirst, we compute the exterior derivative $d\\alpha$ of the $1$-form $\\alpha = -\\dfrac{y}{2}\\,dx + \\dfrac{x}{2}\\,dy$.\n$d\\alpha = d\\left(-\\dfrac{y}{2}\\,dx + \\dfrac{x}{2}\\,dy\\right) = d\\left(-\\dfrac{y}{2}\\,dx\\right) + d\\left(\\dfrac{x}{2}\\,dy\\right)$.\nUsing the properties of the exterior derivative:\n$d\\alpha = \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\dfrac{x}{2}\\right) - \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(-\\dfrac{y}{2}\\right)\\right) dx \\wedge dy$\n$d\\alpha = \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2} - \\left(-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) dx \\wedge dy = \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\right) dx \\wedge dy = 1 \\cdot dx \\wedge dy = dx \\wedge dy$.\nThe $2$-form $dx \\wedge dy$ is the standard area form on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe integral to compute is therefore $\\int_{\\Omega} d\\alpha = \\int_{\\Omega} dx \\wedge dy$. This integral represents the area of the domain $\\Omega$.\nThe area of a triangle with vertices $(x_A, y_A)$, $(x_B, y_B)$, and $(x_C, y_C)$ can be calculated using the shoelace formula or a determinant. With vertex $A$ at the origin $(0,0)$, the area is given by $\\dfrac{1}{2}|x_B y_C - x_C y_B|$.\nUsing the coordinates $B=(3,1)$ and $C=(1,4)$:\n$\\text{Area}(\\Omega) = \\dfrac{1}{2} |(3)(4) - (1)(1)| = \\dfrac{1}{2} |12 - 1| = \\dfrac{1}{2} |11| = \\dfrac{11}{2}$.\nThe positive sign is consistent with the specified counterclockwise orientation of the vertices $A \\to B \\to C$.\nTherefore, $\\displaystyle \\int_{\\Omega} d\\alpha = \\text{Area}(\\Omega) = \\dfrac{11}{2}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth calculations yield the same value:\n$\\displaystyle \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\alpha = \\dfrac{11}{2}$\n$\\displaystyle \\int_{\\Omega} d\\alpha = \\dfrac{11}{2}$\nThis result confirms Stokes' theorem for this specific case.
