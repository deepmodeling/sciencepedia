In the $(x,y)$ coordinate frame, this is written as $0\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 0\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$, which is simply denoted by $0$.\n\n**Part 2: Geometric Interpretation**\n\nThe Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ provides a measure of the failure of the flows of the vector fields $X$ and $Y$ to commute. If $[X,Y]=0$, the flows commute; otherwise, they do not.\n\nLet's find the flows generated by $X$ and $Y$. The flow $\\phi_t^X$ of $X$ is the map that sends a point $p_0=(x_0, y_0)$ to the point $\\gamma(t)$, where $\\gamma$ is the integral curve of $X$ starting at $p_0$. The integral curves are solutions to the system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = x, \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 $$\nWith initial conditions $x(0) = x_0$ and $y(0) = y_0$, the solution is $x(t) = x_0 \\exp(t)$ and $y(t) = y_0$. Thus, the flow of $X$ is:\n$$\\phi_t^X(x_0, y_0) = (x_0 \\exp(t), y_0)$$\nThis flow corresponds to a scaling transformation along the $x$-axis.\n\nSimilarly, the flow $\\psi_s^Y$ of $Y$ is found by solving the system:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{ds} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dy}{ds} = y $$\nWith initial conditions $x(0) = x_0$ and $y(0) = y_0$, the solution is $x(s) = x_0$ and $y(s) = y_0 \\exp(s)$. Thus, the flow of $Y$ is:\n$$\\psi_s^Y(x_0, y_0) = (x_0, y_0 \\exp(s))$$\nThis flow corresponds to a scaling transformation along the $y$-axis.\n\nThe fact that $[X,Y]=0$ implies that these flows commute, meaning that for any $t,s \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, we must have $\\phi_t^X \\circ \\psi_s^Y (p) = \\psi_s^Y \\circ \\phi_t^X (p)$. Let's verify this explicitly.\nLet $p_0 = (x_0, y_0)$.\nFirst, apply the flow of $Y$ for a parameter $s$, then the flow of $X$ for a parameter $t$:\n$$\\phi_t^X(\\psi_s^Y(x_0, y_0)) = \\phi_t^X(x_0, y_0 \\exp(s)) = (x_0 \\exp(t), y_0 \\exp(s))$$\nNext, apply the flow of $X$ for a parameter $t$, then the flow of $Y$ for a parameter $s$:\n$$\\psi_s^Y(\\phi_t^X(x_0, y_0)) = \\psi_s^Y(x_0 \\exp(t), y_0) = (x_0 \\exp(t), y_0 \\exp(s))$$\nThe results are identical. This confirms that the flows commute.\n\nGeometrically, the result $[X,Y]=0$ signifies that the infinitesimal parallelograms formed by the flow lines of $X$ and $Y$ close. More precisely, if one starts at a point $p$, moves for an infinitesimal time $\\epsilon$ along the flow of $X$, then $\\epsilon$ along the flow of $Y$, then $-\\epsilon$ along the flow of $X$, and finally $-\\epsilon$ along the flow of $Y$, one returns to the starting point $p$ up to terms of order higher than $\\epsilon^2$. The displacement from the starting point after this path is approximately $\\epsilon^2 [X,Y]_p$. Since $[X,Y]=0$, this displacement is zero to second order, reflecting the commutativity. In this specific case, the commutativity is exact, not just infinitesimal. The operations of scaling in the $x$-direction and scaling in the $y$-direction are independent, and their order of application is immaterial. The vanishing Lie bracket is the algebraic manifestation of this geometric fact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3078323"}]}
