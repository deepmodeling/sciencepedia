The differential $dF_{p}:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ at a point $p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the derivative of $F$ at $p$.

This only fails at the origin $(0,0)$. The level set is $F^{-1}(1) = \\{(x,y) \\mid x^2+y^2=1\\}$, which is the unit circle. Since the origin $(0,0)$ is not on the unit circle, the differential $dF_p$ has full rank for every point $p \\in F^{-1}(1)$.

According to the Regular Value Theorem, $S = f^{-1}(0)$ is a $1$-dimensional embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ if $0$ is a regular value of $f$. A value $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a regular value if for every point $p \\in f^{-1}(c)$, the differential $df_p$ is surjective. For a map $f: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, this means the differential is not the zero map.\n\nThe differential $df$ is represented by the Jacobian matrix:\n$$\ndf_{(x,y)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2x & 2y \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe differential is the zero map only when both components are zero, which occurs only at the point $p = (0,0)$. This is a critical point of $f$.\n\nFor $0$ to be a regular value, no critical points of $f$ can lie on the level set $f^{-1}(0)$. We check if the critical point $(0,0)$ is in $S$:\n$$\nf(0,0) = 0^{2} - 0^{2} = 0.\n$$\nSince $f(0,0) = 0$, the critical point lies on the level set. Therefore, $0$ is a critical value, not a regular value. The Regular Value Theorem does not guarantee that $S$ is a submanifold. The point where this failure occurs is the origin, $(0,0)$. Geometrically, $S$ is the union of two lines $y = x$ and $y = -x$, which intersect at the origin. A neighborhood of the origin in $S$ is not locally homeomorphic to an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}^{1}$.\n\n**Part 2: Tangent Cone and Angle Calculation**\nThe tangent cone $C_p S$ at a point $p \\in S$ is the set of all limiting directions of secant lines from $p$. We compute the tangent cone at the origin, $C_{(0,0)}S$. The set $S$ consists of two lines, $L_1 = \\{(t,t) : t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ and $L_2 = \\{(t,-t) : t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. Any limiting direction must arise from sequences approaching the origin along these lines.\n\nA vector $v$ is in the tangent cone if $v = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} c_k (p_k - (0,0))$ for some sequence $p_k \\in S \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ with $p_k \\to (0,0)$ and scalars $c_k > 0$.\n- If we take a sequence $p_k = (t_k, t_k)$ along $L_1$ with $t_k \\to 0$, we can choose $c_k = 1/|t_k|$. The limit of $c_k p_k$ will be either $(1,1)$ or $(-1,-1)$. The set of all such limits forms the entire line $L_1$.\n- Similarly, a sequence along $L_2$ gives the line $L_2$.\nTherefore, the tangent cone at the origin is the union of the two lines:\n$$\nC_{(0,0)}S = L_1 \\cup L_2 = S.\n$$\nThe two distinct one-dimensional directions spanning this cone are given by the direction vectors of the lines, for example, $\\vec{d_1} = (1,1)$ for $L_1$ and $\\vec{d_2} = (1,-1)$ for $L_2$. The angle $\\theta$ between these two vectors is given by the dot product formula:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{d_1} \\cdot \\vec{d_2}}{\\|\\vec{d_1}\\| \\|\\vec{d_2}\\|}.\n$$\nWe compute the dot product: $\\vec{d_1} \\cdot \\vec{d_2} = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) = 0$.\nSince the dot product is zero, the vectors are orthogonal.\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = 0 \\implies \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians}.\n$$\nThe angle between the two directions is $\\pi/2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3079607"}, {"introduction": "Transversality is not just a convenient condition; it is also a generic one, meaning a non-transverse situation can often be slightly perturbed into a transverse one.

A rank of 1 means the differential is a surjective map onto $\\mathbb{R}$.\nSince the differential is surjective at every point of the preimage, $0$ is a regular value of $h_{t}$.
