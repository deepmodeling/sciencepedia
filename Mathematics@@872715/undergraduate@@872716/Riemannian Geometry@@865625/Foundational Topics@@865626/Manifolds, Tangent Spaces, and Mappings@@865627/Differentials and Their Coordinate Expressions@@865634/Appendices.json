In a coordinate representation, this linear map is given by the Jacobian matrix of $\\phi$ at the point $(x,y)$. The entries of this matrix, which we will denote by $[d\\phi_{(x,y)}]$, are the partial derivatives of the component functions of $\\phi$ with respect to the coordinate variables of the domain.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $J_\\phi(x,y)$ is defined as:\n$$\n[d\\phi_{(x,y)}] = J_\\phi(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\phi^1}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial \\phi^1}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\phi^2}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial \\phi^2}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi^1}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x \\cos y) = \\cos y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi^1}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x \\cos y) = -x \\sin y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi^2}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x \\sin y) = \\sin y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi^2}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x \\sin y) = x \\cos y\n$$\nSubstituting these into the matrix, we obtain the coordinate representation of the differential:\n$$\n[d\\phi_{(x,y)}] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos y  -x \\sin y \\\\ \\sin y  x \\cos y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we determine the rank of this matrix for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.
