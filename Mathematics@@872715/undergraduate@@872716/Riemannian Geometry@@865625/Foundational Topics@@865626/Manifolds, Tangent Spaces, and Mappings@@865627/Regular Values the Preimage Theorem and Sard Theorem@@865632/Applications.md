## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the foundational principles of [regular values](@entry_id:161151), the Preimage Theorem, and Sard's Theorem. While these results are central to the theoretical framework of [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818), their true power is revealed in their application across a wide range of mathematical disciplines. This chapter will explore how these core theorems are utilized to construct and analyze geometric objects, define profound topological invariants, facilitate advanced integration techniques, and establish general properties of geometric interactions. We will move from the abstract definitions to concrete, interdisciplinary contexts, demonstrating that these principles form a vital toolkit for the modern geometer.

### Constructing Manifolds from Equations

The most immediate and fundamental application of the Preimage Theorem is in the construction of [smooth manifolds](@entry_id:160799). Many geometric objects of interest are defined implicitly as the solution sets of systems of equations. The Preimage Theorem provides a rigorous criterion for determining when such a [solution set](@entry_id:154326) constitutes a smooth manifold.

Consider a smooth function $f \colon M \to \mathbb{R}$. If $c \in \mathbb{R}$ is a [regular value](@entry_id:188218) of $f$, the theorem guarantees that the level set $f^{-1}(c)$ is a smooth, [embedded submanifold](@entry_id:273162) of $M$ with a dimension of $\dim(M) - 1$. A classic illustration is the construction of the $(n-1)$-sphere, $S^{n-1}$. Let $f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be the function $f(x) = \|x\|^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$. Its differential at a point $x$ applied to a vector $v$ is $df_x(v) = 2\langle x, v \rangle$. This differential is surjective (i.e., not the zero map) as long as $x \neq 0$. The point $x=0$ is the only critical point of $f$, and its image, $f(0)=0$, is the only critical value. Consequently, any value $c  0$ is a [regular value](@entry_id:188218). The Preimage Theorem then asserts that for any $c0$, the [level set](@entry_id:637056) $f^{-1}(c) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \|x\|^2 = c\}$ is a smooth [embedded submanifold](@entry_id:273162) of $\mathbb{R}^n$ of dimension $n-1$. This provides a rigorous construction of the sphere of radius $\sqrt{c}$ as a smooth manifold [@problem_id:3062876].

The regularity of a map often reflects the geometric simplicity of its level sets. For the function $f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by the projection $f(x) = x_1$, the differential is constant and surjective everywhere. Thus, every value $c \in \mathbb{R}$ is a [regular value](@entry_id:188218). The corresponding [level sets](@entry_id:151155) $f^{-1}(c) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid x_1=c\}$ are affine [hyperplanes](@entry_id:268044). These are known to be "flat" in the Euclidean sense; a more advanced analysis shows their second fundamental form and [mean curvature](@entry_id:162147) are identically zero, classifying them as [totally geodesic submanifolds](@entry_id:637049) [@problem_id:3062886].

The power of the Preimage Theorem extends seamlessly to maps with higher-dimensional codomains, which correspond to defining manifolds via systems of equations. For a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $F \colon M \to N$, a value $y \in N$ is regular if the differential $dF_x$ is surjective for all $x \in F^{-1}(y)$. If this condition holds, $F^{-1}(y)$ is a smooth [embedded submanifold](@entry_id:273162) of $M$ with dimension $\dim(M) - \dim(N)$. Verifying this condition involves computing the Jacobian matrix of $F$ and checking that it has full rank (equal to $\dim(N)$) at all points in the preimage. For instance, a manifold $S \subset \mathbb{R}^5$ can be defined by a pair of equations $f_1(x) = c_1$ and $f_2(x) = c_2$. This is equivalent to finding the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) of $(c_1, c_2)$ under the map $F=(f_1, f_2) \colon \mathbb{R}^5 \to \mathbb{R}^2$. If the $2 \times 5$ Jacobian matrix of $F$ has rank $2$ at all points in $S$, then the Preimage Theorem guarantees $S$ is a smooth submanifold of dimension $5-2=3$. Furthermore, the [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) at a point $p \in S$ is elegantly characterized as the kernel of the [linear map](@entry_id:201112) $dF_p \colon T_p\mathbb{R}^5 \to T_{(c_1,c_2)}\mathbb{R}^2$ [@problem_id:3062817].

### The Geometry and Topology of Level Sets

Beyond simply affirming the existence of manifolds, the framework of [regular values](@entry_id:161151) allows us to probe the intricate geometric and topological structure of a manifold by analyzing the level sets of a well-chosen function.

#### Morse Theory: Probing Topology with Functions

Morse theory is a profound field that connects the critical points of a [smooth function](@entry_id:158037) on a manifold to the manifold's topology. The Preimage Theorem and Sard's Theorem are its cornerstones. The central idea is to study how the topology of a [sublevel set](@entry_id:172753), $M_t = f^{-1}((-\infty, t])$, changes as the level $t$ increases.

For any smooth function $f \colon M \to \mathbb{R}$, a non-critical value is, by definition, a [regular value](@entry_id:188218). Therefore, between any two critical values, all [level sets](@entry_id:151155) are smooth manifolds, and moreover, they are all diffeomorphic to one another. The topology of the [sublevel sets](@entry_id:636882) remains constant as $t$ passes through [regular values](@entry_id:161151). The fascinating changes in topology occur precisely when $t$ crosses a critical value.

Consider the height function $f(x,y,z) = z$ on the unit sphere $S^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$. The critical points are the south pole $(0,0,-1)$ and the north pole $(0,0,1)$, with corresponding critical values $-1$ and $1$. For any value $c \in (-1, 1)$, the level set $f^{-1}(c)$ is a circle of latitude—a smooth 1-dimensional manifold [@problem_id:3062870]. A more intricate example is the [height function](@entry_id:271993) on a standard torus of revolution in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The [critical points](@entry_id:144653) form two circles: the "bottom" circle at height $-r$ and the "top" circle at height $r$. For any [regular value](@entry_id:188218) $c \in (-r, r)$, the level set is not one circle, but a disjoint union of two circles [@problem_id:3062827].

Morse theory formalizes this by stating that as $t$ crosses a single, non-degenerate critical value, the topology of the [sublevel set](@entry_id:172753) $M_t$ changes by the attachment of a "handle" ($D^k \times D^{n-k}$). The dimension of the handle's core, $k$, is the index of the critical point. Sard's theorem is essential here, as it guarantees that critical values are isolated points (in the case of Morse functions on compact manifolds), meaning we can study these [topological changes](@entry_id:136654) one at a time [@problem_id:3062822] [@problem_id:3052935].

#### Degree Theory: A Global Invariant from Local Data

Regular values are also instrumental in defining one of the most important invariants in [differential topology](@entry_id:157662): the [degree of a map](@entry_id:158493). Let $f \colon M \to N$ be a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) between two compact, connected, oriented manifolds of the same dimension $n$. By Sard's theorem, we can choose a [regular value](@entry_id:188218) $y \in N$. The [preimage](@entry_id:150899) $f^{-1}(y)$ is a finite set of points. At each point $x \in f^{-1}(y)$, the differential $df_x$ is an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127). Since the tangent spaces are oriented, we can assign a sign, $+1$ or $-1$, to $df_x$ depending on whether it preserves or reverses orientation. The degree of $f$, denoted $\deg(f)$, is defined as the sum of these signs over all points in the preimage:
$$
\deg(f) = \sum_{x \in f^{-1}(y)} \text{sgn}(\det(df_x))
$$
A deep result in topology shows that this integer value is independent of the choice of [regular value](@entry_id:188218) $y$. It is a homotopy invariant, meaning it does not change under [continuous deformation](@entry_id:151691) of the map $f$. This allows a local, differential property to define a global, [topological invariant](@entry_id:142028) [@problem_id:3045716].

A canonical example is the map $f \colon S^1 \to S^1$ given by $f(z) = z^n$ for an integer $n$, where we view $S^1$ as the unit circle in the complex plane. For any [regular value](@entry_id:188218) (e.g., $y=1$), there are $|n|$ [preimage](@entry_id:150899) points, and the differential at each point preserves orientation if $n>0$ and reverses it if $n0$. The sum of signs yields a degree of exactly $n$. This aligns perfectly with the intuitive notion of the winding number: the map wraps the circle around itself $n$ times [@problem_id:3065992]. The degree has powerful properties, such as the integral formula $\deg(f) = \int_M f^*\omega$ (where $\omega$ is a volume form on $N$ with total integral 1) and the multiplicative property $\deg(g \circ f) = \deg(g) \cdot \deg(f)$ [@problem_id:3045716].

### Integration on Manifolds: The Coarea Formula

The interplay between [regular values](@entry_id:161151) and Sard's theorem provides the theoretical underpinning for the [coarea formula](@entry_id:162087), a profound tool in geometric analysis and measure theory that generalizes Fubini's theorem. For a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f \colon M^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ ($m \ge n$), the formula relates an integral over the domain $M$ to an [iterated integral](@entry_id:138713) over the [target space](@entry_id:143180) $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the [level sets](@entry_id:151155) of $f$.

For an integrable function $h \colon M \to [0, \infty)$, the formula states:
$$
\int_M h(x) J_f(x) \, d\operatorname{vol}_M(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \left( \int_{f^{-1}(y)} h \, d\operatorname{vol}_{m-n} \right) dy
$$
Here, $J_f(x)$ is the normal Jacobian, which measures the volume distortion of the differential $df_x$ in directions orthogonal to the [level set](@entry_id:637056). The logic is twofold:
1.  **Preimage Theorem**: For any [regular value](@entry_id:188218) $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$, the level set $f^{-1}(y)$ is a smooth $(m-n)$-dimensional submanifold. This ensures that the inner integral, taken with respect to the induced Riemannian volume measure on the level set, is well-defined.
2.  **Sard's Theorem**: The set of critical values of $f$ has Lebesgue measure zero in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The [level sets](@entry_id:151155) over these values might be singular, but because this set is negligible with respect to the outer Lebesgue measure $dy$, these singularities do not affect the value of the integral.
Together, these theorems justify "slicing" the integral over $M$ into integrals over the well-behaved fibers corresponding to almost every point in the [codomain](@entry_id:139336) [@problem_id:3062843].

A beautiful application of this formula is the calculation of the surface area of a sphere $S_R^2$ of radius $R$. By taking the height function $h(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_3$, the [level sets](@entry_id:151155) $h^{-1}(t)$ for [regular values](@entry_id:161151) $t \in (-R, R)$ are circles of latitude. By applying the [coarea formula](@entry_id:162087) (in the form $\operatorname{Vol}(M) = \int (\int_{f^{-1}(t)} \frac{1}{\|\nabla f\|} dS_t) dt$), one can integrate the lengths of these circles, properly weighted by the inverse of the gradient's norm, to elegantly recover the classic result, $\operatorname{Area}(S_R^2) = 4\pi R^2$ [@problem_id:3062793].

### Transversality: Generic Intersections and Stability

The concept of a [regular value](@entry_id:188218) can be powerfully generalized to the notion of [transversality](@entry_id:158669), which describes the "clean" intersection of maps and submanifolds. This concept is fundamental to modern [differential topology](@entry_id:157662), providing a language to discuss generic properties and stability.

#### The Transverse Preimage Theorem

Let $f \colon M \to N$ be a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) and $S \subset N$ be an [embedded submanifold](@entry_id:273162). We say that $f$ is transverse to $S$, denoted $f \pitchfork S$, if for every point $x \in f^{-1}(S)$, the image of the [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) of $M$ and the [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) of $S$ together span the [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) of the ambient manifold $N$:
$$
T_{f(x)}S + \operatorname{Im}(df_x) = T_{f(x)}N
$$
This condition generalizes the notion of a [regular value](@entry_id:188218) (which corresponds to the case where $S$ is a single point, so $T_{f(x)}S = \{0\}$). The Transverse Preimage Theorem states that if $f \pitchfork S$, then the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) $f^{-1}(S)$ is a smooth, [embedded submanifold](@entry_id:273162) of $M$. Furthermore, its [codimension](@entry_id:273141) in $M$ is equal to the [codimension](@entry_id:273141) of $S$ in $N$, and its [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) at $x$ is given by $T_x(f^{-1}(S)) = (df_x)^{-1}(T_{f(x)}S)$ [@problem_id:3062834].

This theorem is essential for understanding intersections of submanifolds. For instance, the intersection of two submanifolds $C$ and $D$ within a larger manifold $M$ is transverse if at every intersection point $p \in C \cap D$, we have $T_pC + T_pD = T_pM$. This geometric condition can be recast using the [transversality](@entry_id:158669) framework. For example, the intersection of two families of curves on a [2-torus](@entry_id:265991) can be analyzed as the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) of a point under a combined map $\Phi \colon T^2 \to S^1 \times S^1$. If the determinant of the Jacobian of $\Phi$ is non-zero, the map is transverse to every point, guaranteeing that the intersections are transverse and finite. The number of intersection points is then given by the absolute value of this determinant, providing a direct link to [intersection theory](@entry_id:157884) [@problem_id:3062806].

#### Thom's Transversality Theorem: The Genericity of Transversality

Perhaps the most profound consequence of Sard's theorem is that [transversality](@entry_id:158669) is not an exceptional circumstance; it is the generic case. Thom's Transversality Theorem states that for any [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f \colon M \to N$, "almost any" small perturbation of $f$ is transverse to a given submanifold $S \subset N$.

The proof of this remarkable fact involves a clever application of Sard's theorem. One constructs a larger "parametric" map, for example $F(a,x) = f(x)+a$ for perturbations $a \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and shows that $F$ is a [submersion](@entry_id:161795). By applying the Transverse Preimage Theorem, $F^{-1}(S)$ is a manifold. Sard's theorem is then applied to the projection from this manifold onto the parameter space. The [regular values](@entry_id:161151) of this projection correspond precisely to the parameters for which the perturbed map is transverse. Since the set of critical values has measure zero, the set of "bad" parameters for which [transversality](@entry_id:158669) fails is negligible [@problem_id:3050986].

This "generic" nature of [transversality](@entry_id:158669) is a powerful philosophical and practical tool. It means that properties that depend on transverse intersections are stable under small perturbations and representative of the general case. This ensures that many of the well-behaved geometric situations we study are not rare coincidences but are, in a rigorous sense, the norm.

In conclusion, the principles of [regular values](@entry_id:161151), the Preimage Theorem, and Sard's Theorem extend far beyond their initial formulations. They are indispensable for constructing manifolds, defining [topological invariants](@entry_id:138526) like the degree, enabling advanced integration via the [coarea formula](@entry_id:162087), and establishing the generic nature of geometric properties through [transversality](@entry_id:158669). They form a robust bridge connecting the local world of calculus to the global realms of geometry and topology.
