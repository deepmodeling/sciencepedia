## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the fundamental principles and mechanisms of the lexicographic [order topology](@entry_id:143222), we now shift our focus to its broader significance. This topology is far more than a technical exercise; it is a fertile ground for constructing examples and counterexamples that illuminate the subtle and often surprising relationships between core [topological properties](@entry_id:154666). By applying the lexicographic order to various product sets, we can generate spaces that challenge our intuition and clarify the necessity of certain axioms in definitions such as that of a [topological manifold](@entry_id:160590). This chapter explores these applications, demonstrating how the lexicographic order serves as an indispensable tool for deepening our understanding of topology and its connections to other mathematical disciplines.

### Connectivity: A Study in Contrasts

The concept of connectedness, one of the most intuitive [topological invariants](@entry_id:138526), becomes remarkably nuanced in the context of the lexicographic order. Different underlying sets can produce topologies that range from fully connected to [totally disconnected](@entry_id:149247).

A canonical example is the **[ordered square](@entry_id:151652)**, $X = [0,1] \times [0,1]$, with the lexicographic [order topology](@entry_id:143222). As a [linearly ordered topological space](@entry_id:152684) (LOTS) that is Dedekind complete and possesses a least and [greatest element](@entry_id:276547), the [ordered square](@entry_id:151652) is a linear continuum. A foundational theorem states that all linear continua are connected. However, this [connectedness](@entry_id:142066) does not extend to [path-connectedness](@entry_id:142695). While any two points on the same vertical line segment $\{x\} \times [0,1]$ can be easily joined by a path, no path can connect points with different first coordinates. A hypothetical [continuous path](@entry_id:156599) from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_2, y_2)$ with $x_1  x_2$ would have a compact and connected image. In a LOTS, [connected sets](@entry_id:136460) are order-convex, meaning the image must contain the entire order interval between the two points. This interval, however, contains an uncountable number of disjoint, non-empty open sets of the form $\{x\} \times (0,1)$ for each $x \in (x_1, x_2)$. The continuous image of $[0,1]$ is a [compact metric space](@entry_id:156601) and therefore must be second-countable, but a [second-countable space](@entry_id:141954) cannot contain an uncountable collection of disjoint non-empty open sets. This contradiction proves that the [ordered square](@entry_id:151652) is not path-connected, with its path components being precisely the vertical line segments [@problem_id:1567652]. A [closed subspace](@entry_id:267213) of the [ordered square](@entry_id:151652), such as $C \times \{0,1\}$ where $C$ is the Cantor set, is compact but similarly not connected [@problem_id:1561277].

The situation changes dramatically if we change the underlying set. The **lexicographically ordered plane**, $L = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, is not connected at all. For any fixed $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$, the vertical line $V_{x_0} = \{x_0\} \times \mathbb{R}$ can be shown to be an open set. An [open interval](@entry_id:144029) of the form $((x_0, y_0 - 1), (x_0, y_0 + 1))$ is contained entirely within $V_{x_0}$. Since each such vertical line is open, the space $L$ is a disjoint union of uncountably many non-empty open sets and is therefore massively disconnected. Because it is not connected, it cannot be path-connected [@problem_id:1561288].

An even stronger form of disconnection occurs in spaces like $S = \mathbb{R} \times \{-1, 1\}$. In this ordered set, for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$, the points $(x, -1)$ and $(x, 1)$ are consecutive; there are no points in $S$ between them. This "gap" can be used to separate the space into two disjoint open sets, proving it is not connected. A more detailed analysis reveals that any connected subset of $S$ can contain at most one point, meaning the space is [totally disconnected](@entry_id:149247) [@problem_id:1561235].

Conversely, it is possible to construct a connected and [path-connected space](@entry_id:156428) using the lexicographic order. The **[long line](@entry_id:156079)**, often constructed as $\omega_1 \times [0,1)$ where $\omega_1$ is the [first uncountable ordinal](@entry_id:156023), is a linear continuum and is therefore connected. Furthermore, any closed interval $[x, y]$ within this space is a separable linear continuum, which is order-homeomorphic to a real interval. This property allows for the construction of paths between any two points, establishing that the space is path-connected, in stark contrast to the [ordered square](@entry_id:151652) [@problem_id:2309724].

### The Topological Dichotomy of Subspaces

One of the most counter-intuitive features of the lexicographic [order topology](@entry_id:143222) on a product like $Y = [0,1) \times [0,1)$ is the profound difference between the subspace topologies of "vertical" and "horizontal" lines. This distinction is sharply illustrated when considering topological embeddings into such a space.

A vertical line segment, such as $\{1/2\} \times [0,1)$, inherits a subspace topology that is homeomorphic to the standard topology on $[0,1)$. The function $f(t) = (1/2, t)$ is continuous, and its inverse mapping from the image back to $[0,1)$ is also continuous. Thus, this function is a [topological embedding](@entry_id:154583), faithfully representing the topology of the interval within the larger space [@problem_id:1561229].

The situation is radically different for any subspace that is not contained within a single vertical line. For instance, a horizontal line segment like $[0,1) \times \{1/2\}$, or the diagonal line segment given by $\{(t, t) \mid t \in [0,1)\}$, inherits the discrete topology. For any point $(x_0, y_0)$ in such a set, one can find a small open interval of the form $((x_0, y_0 - \epsilon), (x_0, y_0 + \epsilon))$ in the larger space. The intersection of this interval with the horizontal line or diagonal is just the singleton point $\{(x_0, y_0)\}$. Since every singleton is an open set in the subspace topology, the subspace is discrete. This implies that functions like $f(t) = (t, 1/2)$ are not continuous when the domain has the standard topology, because the preimage of the open set $\{(t, 1/2)\}$ would be the non-open set $\{t\}$ [@problem_id:1561229].

### Countability Axioms, Metrizability, and Normality

The lexicographic order provides a rich source of examples for exploring the hierarchy of [countability axioms](@entry_id:152407) (separability, second countability, Lindelöf property) and their connection to [metrizability](@entry_id:154239).

Many lexicographically ordered spaces fail to be separable. A common strategy to prove non-separability is to identify an uncountable family of pairwise disjoint, non-empty open sets. Any [dense subset](@entry_id:150508) would need to contain at least one point from each of these sets, forcing it to be uncountable. This is the case for the [ordered square](@entry_id:151652) $[0,1] \times [0,1]$, where the sets $\{x\} \times (0,1)$ for $x \in [0,1]$ form such a family [@problem_id:1563951]. The same reasoning applies to spaces like $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{Q}$ and $C \times \mathbb{Q}$, where $C$ is the Cantor set; in both cases, the "vertical fibers" above an uncountable set are disjoint open sets, rendering the spaces non-separable [@problem_id:1561238] [@problem_id:1561217].

The distinction between separability and second countability is clearly illustrated by the space $L = \mathbb{R} \times \{0,1\}$. This space is separable, as the countable set $\mathbb{Q} \times \{0\}$ is dense. However, $L$ is not second-countable. For each $x \in \mathbb{R}$, the point $(x,1)$ has an immediate predecessor $(x,0)$, and any open basis element containing $(x,1)$ but not $(x,0)$ must be an interval of the form $((x,0), b)$. As there is an uncountable number of such distinct required basis elements (one for each $x \in \mathbb{R}$), no [countable basis](@entry_id:155278) can exist. Since a [metric space](@entry_id:145912) is separable if and only if it is second-countable, the fact that $L$ is separable but not second-countable immediately implies it is **not metrizable** [@problem_id:1561246].

In contrast, if the first coordinate set is countable, the situation can change. The space $\mathbb{Q} \times [0,1]$ is separable, with the [countable set](@entry_id:140218) $\mathbb{Q} \times (\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1])$ serving as a [dense subset](@entry_id:150508). Furthermore, one can construct a [countable basis](@entry_id:155278) from intervals with endpoints in this dense set. Being second-countable and separable, this space is also Lindelöf [@problem_id:1561245]. On the other hand, if the first coordinate set is discrete, like the integers $\mathbb{Z}$, the resulting space $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{R}$ becomes a topological disjoint union of a countable number of copies of $\mathbb{R}$. Such a space is metrizable [@problem_id:1561252].

The lexicographic order also provides a classic example concerning normality. Every LOTS is hereditarily normal. The [ordered square](@entry_id:151652) $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ is therefore a [normal space](@entry_id:154487). However, as we have seen, it is not separable. This makes the [ordered square](@entry_id:151652) a key counterexample in [general topology](@entry_id:152375): it is a **compact, connected, normal space that is not separable** (and, as a consequence of non-separability, not metrizable) [@problem_id:1563951].

### Connection to Advanced Topics and Manifold Theory

The utility of the lexicographic order extends into more advanced areas of analysis and geometry, particularly as a source of pathological examples that motivate definitions in manifold theory.

For instance, the lexicographically ordered plane $L = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ is a Baire space. This can be seen by recognizing it as a topological sum of the spaces $\{x\} \times \mathbb{R}$, each of which is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ and thus a Baire space. This property allows for the classification of subsets as meager or of the second category. For example, the set $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{R}$ is a countable union of open sets $\{q\} \times \mathbb{R}$ for $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, making it an open set and thus of the second category in $L$ [@problem_id:1561228].

Perhaps the most significant application lies in understanding the definition of a smooth manifold. A manifold is required to be not only locally Euclidean and Hausdorff, but also second-countable. The lexicographic order demonstrates why these axioms are not redundant.

First, no subspace of the lexicographically ordered plane $L = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ can be homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. One reason is that any subspace of $L$ whose projection onto the first coordinate contains an interval is not separable, whereas $\mathbb{R}^2$ is separable. Another topological invariant that distinguishes them is the existence of cut points: removing a point from $\mathbb{R}^2$ leaves a [connected space](@entry_id:153144), but removing a point from any non-trivial subspace of $L$ disconnects it. Therefore, despite both being "planes" of points, their topologies are fundamentally incompatible [@problem_id:1561236].

Second, and most critically, the **long line** $\mathbb{L}$ serves as the canonical example of a space that is locally Euclidean and Hausdorff but fails to be second-countable. This failure has profound consequences. A key theorem states that a Hausdorff, locally Euclidean space is paracompact if and only if it is second-countable. Since [the long line](@entry_id:152597) is not second-countable, it is **not paracompact**. The existence of [partitions of unity](@entry_id:152644), which are essential for piecing together local constructions (like defining integration or global [differential forms](@entry_id:146747)) on a manifold, is guaranteed on paracompact Hausdorff spaces. The failure of [paracompactness](@entry_id:152096) on [the long line](@entry_id:152597) means that [partitions of unity](@entry_id:152644) subordinate to arbitrary open covers do not exist. For example, the [open cover](@entry_id:140020) of the long ray consisting of initial segments $\{[0, \alpha) \mid \alpha  \omega_1\}$ does not admit a [locally finite refinement](@entry_id:152033), which is a necessary condition for the existence of a subordinate [partition of unity](@entry_id:141893). This demonstrates that second-[countability](@entry_id:148500) is not a mere technical convenience in the definition of a manifold; it is a crucial axiom that ensures the space is "tame" enough to support the essential tools of [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818) [@problem_id:2990241].

In conclusion, the lexicographic [order topology](@entry_id:143222) is a powerful and versatile construct. It provides an essential laboratory for students and researchers alike, allowing for the exploration of deep connections between fundamental topological properties and offering critical insights into the foundations of modern geometry.
