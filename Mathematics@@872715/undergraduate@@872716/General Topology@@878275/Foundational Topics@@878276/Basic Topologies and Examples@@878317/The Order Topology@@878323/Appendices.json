This practice introduces the lexicographic order on the unit square, a crucial example in topology. You will explore the nature of open sets in this space, which will challenge your geometric intuition and reinforce the importance of relying on formal definitions [@problem_id:1561271].", "problem": "Consider the unit square $S = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$. We define the lexicographic order (or dictionary order) on $S$. For two points $p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ in $S$, we say $p_1  p_2$ if and only if $x_1  x_2$, or if $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1  y_2$. The set $S$ is endowed with the order topology induced by this lexicographic order.

No, $V$ is not open because it is a \"thin\" line segment, and no open set from the standard Euclidean topology on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is contained within it.\n\nD. Yes, $V$ is open, but only because the interval $(0,1)$ is open in the standard topology of $\\mathbb{R}$.", "solution": "We work in the order topology induced by the lexicographic order on $S=[0,1]\\times[0,1]$. By definition of the order topology on a linearly ordered set, a basis is given by all open intervals $(a,b)=\\{p\\in S: apb\\}$, together with half-open intervals at the ends if a global minimum or maximum exists.\n\nDefine $a=(\\frac{1}{2},0)$ and $b=(\\frac{1}{2},1)$, both elements of $S$. We claim that\n$$\nV=(a,b).\n$$\n\nFirst, let $p=(\\tfrac{1}{2},y)\\in V$. Then $0y1$, so in the lexicographic order, since the first coordinates are equal, we compare the second coordinates and obtain $apb$. Hence $p\\in(a,b)$, proving $V\\subseteq(a,b)$.\n\nConversely, let $p=(x,y)\\in(a,b)$. Then $ap$ implies $p$ is not less than or equal to $a$. In the lexicographic order, any point with $x\\tfrac{1}{2}$ satisfies $pa$, so $ap$ rules out $x\\tfrac{1}{2}$. Similarly, $pb$ rules out $x\\tfrac{1}{2}$ because any point with $x\\tfrac{1}{2}$ satisfies $pb$. Therefore, $x=\\tfrac{1}{2}$. With $x=\\tfrac{1}{2}$, the inequalities $apb$ reduce to $0y1$. Hence $p\\in\\{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\}\\times(0,1)=V$, proving $(a,b)\\subseteq V$.\n\nThus $V=(a,b)$ is a single open interval in the lexicographic order, so $V$ is open. This matches statement A; statements B, C, and D are incorrect for the reasons that one can isolate vertical slices by intervals with the same first coordinate, Euclidean openness is irrelevant here, and the openness does not follow merely from $(0,1)$ being open in $\\mathbb{R}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1561271"}]}
