## Introduction
In the study of [general topology](@entry_id:152375), a topological space is most commonly introduced as a set equipped with a collection of 'open sets' that satisfy a few core axioms. This global definition is powerful and concise, but it can feel abstract, somewhat removed from the intuitive, geometric idea of "nearness" to a point. How can we formally capture the local structure of space around a single point, and can this local perspective serve as an alternative foundation for all of topology?

This article addresses this exact question by developing the concept of a **[neighborhood system](@entry_id:150290)**. We will show that by starting with a rigorous local description of space, we can build the entire edifice of topology in a way that is fully equivalent to the traditional open-set approach. The journey will bridge the gap between abstract axioms and local intuition.

Across the following chapters, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of this dual perspective. The "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter will lay the formal groundwork, defining neighborhoods, establishing their axiomatic properties, and proving their equivalence to open sets. The "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will demonstrate how this local viewpoint is not merely a theoretical curiosity but a vital tool used to construct complex spaces and model phenomena in fields from Riemannian geometry to number theory. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will provide opportunities to apply these concepts and solidify your understanding through targeted problems.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the study of topology, our primary objects of interest are [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056), which are sets endowed with a structure that allows for the definition of concepts such as continuity, convergence, and [connectedness](@entry_id:142066). The most common way to define this structure is through a collection of subsets called **open sets**. However, this global, axiomatic definition can sometimes feel disconnected from the intuitive, local experience of "nearness" to a point. This chapter explores an alternative and equivalent foundation for topology based on the local concept of a **neighborhood**. We will demonstrate that starting from a local description of space around each point is not only possible but also provides a powerful and intuitive lens through which to understand topological properties. We will establish the rigorous correspondence between the global open-set-based topology and the local neighborhood-based structure, showing them to be two sides of the same coin.

### From Open Sets to Neighborhoods

Let us begin with a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is the collection of open sets satisfying the standard axioms. While an open set is a global property of the set itself, the concept of a neighborhood brings the focus to the relationship between a set and a specific point.

A set $N \subseteq X$ is defined as a **neighborhood** of a point $x \in X$ if there exists an open set $U \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $x \in U \subseteq N$. In essence, a neighborhood of a point is any set that contains an "open buffer" around that point. The collection of all neighborhoods of a point $x$ is called the **[neighborhood system](@entry_id:150290)** at $x$, denoted $\mathcal{N}_x$.

This definition is particularly intuitive in the context of [metric spaces](@entry_id:138860). In a [metric space](@entry_id:145912) $(X, d)$, the open sets are generated by [open balls](@entry_id:143668). An [open ball](@entry_id:141481) with center $x$ and radius $\epsilon > 0$ is the set $B(x, \epsilon) = \{y \in X \mid d(x, y) < \epsilon\}$. Because [open balls](@entry_id:143668) are themselves open sets, the definition of a neighborhood simplifies: a set $N$ is a neighborhood of $x$ if and only if there exists some $\epsilon > 0$ such that the open ball $B(x, \epsilon)$ is a subset of $N$. This means that $N$ contains not only $x$ but all points "sufficiently close" to $x$.

Let's consider some concrete examples in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the standard metric [@problem_id:1571469]. Is the set $S_A = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid 2x^2 + 3y^2 \le 6 \}$ a neighborhood of the origin $(0,0)$? The point $(0,0)$ is clearly in $S_A$. To check the neighborhood condition, we must determine if we can fit an open disk $B((0,0), \epsilon)$ centered at the origin inside $S_A$. A point $(x,y)$ is in such a disk if $x^2 + y^2 < \epsilon^2$. We observe that $2x^2 + 3y^2 \le 3(x^2+y^2) < 3\epsilon^2$. If we choose $\epsilon$ small enough, say $\epsilon = \sqrt{2}$, then $3\epsilon^2 = 6$. Thus, for any point in the ball $B((0,0), \sqrt{2})$, we have $2x^2 + 3y^2 < 6$, which means the point is in the interior of the elliptical region defined by $S_A$. Therefore, $B((0,0), \sqrt{2}) \subseteq S_A$, and $S_A$ is indeed a neighborhood of the origin.

In contrast, consider the set $S_B = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid y \ge x^4 \}$. The origin $(0,0)$ is in $S_B$. However, any open disk $B((0,0), \epsilon)$ centered at the origin, no matter how small $\epsilon$ is, will contain points with small negative $y$-coordinates (e.g., the point $(0, -\epsilon/2)$). For such a point, the condition $y \ge x^4$ becomes $-\epsilon/2 \ge 0$, which is false. Therefore, no open disk around the origin is fully contained within $S_B$, and $S_B$ is not a neighborhood of the origin. It touches the origin but does not contain any "breathing room" around it in all directions.

### Characterizing Open Sets via Neighborhoods

The concepts of open sets and neighborhoods are deeply intertwined. The following theorem provides a fundamental bridge between them, allowing us to define one in terms of the other.

**Theorem:** A set $U \subseteq X$ is open if and only if it is a neighborhood of each of its points.

**Proof:**
($\Rightarrow$) Assume $U$ is an open set in $\mathcal{T}$. For any point $x \in U$, we can choose the open set in the definition of a neighborhood to be $U$ itself. Since $x \in U \subseteq U$, it follows directly that $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$. This holds for all $x \in U$.

($\Leftarrow$) Assume $U$ is a neighborhood of each of its points. This means that for every $x \in U$, there exists an open set $O_x \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $x \in O_x \subseteq U$. If we take the union of all such open sets for every point in $U$, we get $\bigcup_{x \in U} O_x$. On one hand, since each $x \in U$ is in its corresponding $O_x$, we have $U \subseteq \bigcup_{x \in U} O_x$. On the other hand, since each $O_x$ is a subset of $U$, their union must also be a subset of $U$: $\bigcup_{x \in U} O_x \subseteq U$. Therefore, $U = \bigcup_{x \in U} O_x$. Since the axioms of a topology state that an arbitrary union of open sets is open, $U$ must be an open set.

This theorem is not merely a technical curiosity; it provides the mechanism for one of the most important proofs in topology. For example, to prove that the union of an arbitrary collection of open sets $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ is open, one can use this characterization. Let $U = \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$. For any point $x \in U$, by definition, $x$ must belong to at least one of the sets in the collection, say $A_j$. Since $A_j$ is open, it is a neighborhood of $x$. This means there is an open set $O_x$ with $x \in O_x \subseteq A_j$. But since $A_j \subseteq U$, we have $x \in O_x \subseteq U$. This shows that $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$. Since $x$ was an arbitrary point in $U$, $U$ is a neighborhood of all its points and is therefore open [@problem_id:1571486].

### The Interior of a Set

The notion of a neighborhood allows for a natural and elegant definition of the **interior** of a set. The interior of a set $A$, denoted $A^\circ$, consists of all points for which $A$ is a neighborhood. These are the points that are "safely inside" $A$, with an open buffer zone around them.

**Definition:** The interior of a set $A \subseteq X$ is given by $A^\circ = \{x \in X \mid A \in \mathcal{N}_x \}$.

From this definition, several [critical properties](@entry_id:260687) emerge [@problem_id:1571477]:

1.  **$A^\circ$ is a subset of $A$.** If $x \in A^\circ$, then $A$ is a neighborhood of $x$. By definition, this means there is an open set $U$ with $x \in U \subseteq A$. This immediately implies $x \in A$.

2.  **$A^\circ$ is an open set.** To see this, we can use the characterization from the previous section. We need to show that $A^\circ$ is a neighborhood of each of its points. Let $x \in A^\circ$. This means there is an open set $U$ such that $x \in U \subseteq A$. Now, for any point $y \in U$, we have $y \in U \subseteq A$, where $U$ is open. This implies that $A$ is a neighborhood of $y$, so $y \in A^\circ$. Therefore, we have found an open set $U$ such that $x \in U \subseteq A^\circ$. This proves that $A^\circ$ is a neighborhood of $x$. Since $x$ was an arbitrary point in $A^\circ$, $A^\circ$ is open.

3.  **$A^\circ$ is the largest open set contained in $A$.** We already know $A^\circ$ is an open set contained in $A$. Let $V$ be any other open set such that $V \subseteq A$. For any point $x \in V$, since $V$ is open, we have $x \in V \subseteq A$. This means $A$ is a neighborhood of $x$, so $x \in A^\circ$. Thus, $V \subseteq A^\circ$. This shows that any open set contained in $A$ is also contained in $A^\circ$.

4.  **The interior operator distributes over finite intersections.** For any two sets $A$ and $B$, it holds that $(A \cap B)^\circ = A^\circ \cap B^\circ$. The proof follows from the "largest open set" characterization. Since $A^\circ \cap B^\circ$ is an intersection of two open sets, it is open. Also, $A^\circ \subseteq A$ and $B^\circ \subseteq B$, so $A^\circ \cap B^\circ \subseteq A \cap B$. As $A^\circ \cap B^\circ$ is an open set contained in $A \cap B$, it must be a subset of the largest such set, i.e., $A^\circ \cap B^\circ \subseteq (A \cap B)^\circ$. Conversely, since $(A \cap B)^\circ$ is an open set contained in $A \cap B$, it is contained in $A$ and in $B$. Therefore, $(A \cap B)^\circ \subseteq A^\circ$ and $(A \cap B)^\circ \subseteq B^\circ$, which implies $(A \cap B)^\circ \subseteq A^\circ \cap B^\circ$.

### The Axiomatic Definition of Neighborhood Systems

We have seen that a topology of open sets uniquely determines a [neighborhood system](@entry_id:150290) for each point. We now ask the reverse question: can we start with a set of "proposed" neighborhood systems and use them to *define* a topology? The answer is yes, provided these systems satisfy four fundamental axioms.

Let $X$ be a set. For each $x \in X$, let $\mathcal{N}_x$ be a non-empty collection of subsets of $X$. This family of collections, $\{\mathcal{N}_x\}_{x \in X}$, is a **valid [neighborhood system](@entry_id:150290)** if it satisfies the following axioms for every $x \in X$:

*   **(N1)** For every $N \in \mathcal{N}_x$, it holds that $x \in N$. (A point is an element of its own neighborhoods).
*   **(N2)** If $N \in \mathcal{N}_x$ and $N \subseteq M \subseteq X$, then $M \in \mathcal{N}_x$. (Any superset of a neighborhood is also a neighborhood).
*   **(N3)** If $N_1, N_2 \in \mathcal{N}_x$, then $N_1 \cap N_2 \in \mathcal{N}_x$. (The intersection of two neighborhoods of a point is also a neighborhood of that point. By induction, this applies to any finite intersection).
*   **(N4)** For each $N \in \mathcal{N}_x$, there exists a set $M \in \mathcal{N}_x$ such that $M \subseteq N$ and for every point $y \in M$, the set $N$ is a neighborhood of $y$ (i.e., $N \in \mathcal{N}_y$).

Let's examine a proposed system that fails these axioms to better understand their roles [@problem_id:1571478]. Consider $X=\{1,2,3\}$ with $\mathcal{N}_1 = \{\{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, X\}$, $\mathcal{N}_2 = \{\{2\}, X\}$, and $\mathcal{N}_3 = \{\{1,3\}, X\}$.
- **(N1)** holds, as each point is in its assigned neighborhoods.
- **(N2)** fails. For $x=2$, $\{2\} \in \mathcal{N}_2$. The set $\{1,2\}$ is a superset of $\{2\}$, but $\{1,2\} \notin \mathcal{N}_2$.
- **(N3)** fails. For $x=1$, we have $\{1,2\} \in \mathcal{N}_1$ and $\{1,3\} \in \mathcal{N}_1$. Their intersection is $\{1\}$, but $\{1\} \notin \mathcal{N}_1$.
- **(N4)** fails. For $x=1$ and $N=\{1,2\} \in \mathcal{N}_1$, we need to find some $M \in \mathcal{N}_1$ such that for all $y \in M$, $N \in \mathcal{N}_y$. If we try $M=\{1,2\}$, this would require $N \in \mathcal{N}_2$ for the point $y=2$. But $\{1,2\} \notin \mathcal{N}_2$. No other choice of $M$ from $\mathcal{N}_1$ works either.

Axiom (N4) is the most subtle and powerful. It serves as the crucial link that allows us to recover open sets from the neighborhood structure. It asserts that within any neighborhood $N$ of $x$, we can find a smaller neighborhood $M$ which is, in a sense, "internally stable" with respect to $N$. The insight is that this "stable" inner set $M$ often turns out to be an open set.

Let's see this in the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$ [@problem_id:1571464]. Let $x_0 = 10$ and $N=(8, 15]$. This is a neighborhood of $10$ because it contains the open interval $(9, 11)$, for example. Axiom (N4) requires us to find a neighborhood $M$ of $10$ inside $N$ such that for every point $y \in M$, the set $N$ is a neighborhood of $y$ (i.e., $N \in \mathcal{N}_y$). Let's try $M=(9, 12)$.
1.  $M$ is a neighborhood of $10$ since $10 \in (9, 12) \subseteq M$.
2.  $M \subseteq N$ since $(9, 12) \subseteq (8, 15]$.
3.  We must also check that for every $y \in M$, $N$ is a neighborhood of $y$. This is true, because for any point $y \in (9,12)$, the open set $(9,12)$ contains $y$ and is a subset of $N$.
Thus, our choice of $M=(9, 12)$ satisfies the condition. This illustrates the role of (N4): it guarantees the existence of open neighborhoods inside any given neighborhood.

### The Equivalence of the Two Formulations

Once we have a system $\{\mathcal{N}_x\}_{x \in X}$ satisfying axioms (N1)-(N4), we can define a topology $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{N}}$ from it:

**Definition:** A set $U \subseteq X$ is open in the topology $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{N}}$ if and only if $U \in \mathcal{N}_x$ for every $x \in U$.

It can be rigorously proven that this collection $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{N}}$ satisfies the axioms for a topology. The empty set is vacuously open. The whole set $X$ is in $\mathcal{N}_x$ for all $x$ by (N2). The union property follows from (N2), and the [finite intersection property](@entry_id:153731) follows from (N3).

This establishes a path from neighborhood systems to topologies. We have also seen the path from topologies to neighborhood systems. The final, crucial question is whether these two paths are consistent inverses of one another. The answer is yes.

**Theorem:** [@problem_id:1571485]
Let $\{\mathcal{N}_x\}_{x \in X}$ be a system satisfying axioms (N1)-(N4). Let $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{N}}$ be the topology generated from it. Let $\{\mathcal{N}'_x\}_{x \in X}$ be the [neighborhood system](@entry_id:150290) derived from the topology $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{N}}$. Then, for every $x \in X$, $\mathcal{N}_x = \mathcal{N}'_x$.

The proof involves two inclusions:
1.  **$\mathcal{N}_x \subseteq \mathcal{N}'_x$**: Let $N \in \mathcal{N}_x$. By (N4), there is an $M \in \mathcal{N}_x$ with $M \subseteq N$ such that $N \in \mathcal{N}_y$ for all $y \in M$. Now consider the set $O = \{y \in N \mid N \in \mathcal{N}_y\}$. The set $M$ is a subset of $O$. One can show that $O$ is open in $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{N}}$. Since $x \in M \subseteq O \subseteq N$, we have found an open set $O$ between $x$ and $N$. By the definition of $\mathcal{N}'_x$, this means $N \in \mathcal{N}'_x$.
2.  **$\mathcal{N}'_x \subseteq \mathcal{N}_x$**: Let $N \in \mathcal{N}'_x$. By definition, there exists an open set $U \in \mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{N}}$ such that $x \in U \subseteq N$. By the definition of $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{N}}$, the fact that $U$ is open means $U \in \mathcal{N}_y$ for all $y \in U$. In particular, for our point $x$, we have $U \in \mathcal{N}_x$. Since $U \subseteq N$ and $U \in \mathcal{N}_x$, axiom (N2) implies that the superset $N$ must also be in $\mathcal{N}_x$.

This fundamental theorem confirms that the axiomatic neighborhood approach is a fully rigorous and consistent alternative to the open set approach for defining a [topological space](@entry_id:149165).

### Neighborhood Bases and Non-Standard Topologies

The full [neighborhood system](@entry_id:150290) $\mathcal{N}_x$ for a point $x$ is often an infinitely large collection. For practical purposes, it is more convenient to work with a smaller, more manageable collection that can generate the entire system. This leads to the concept of a **neighborhood base**.

A collection of neighborhoods $\mathcal{B}_x \subseteq \mathcal{N}_x$ is a **neighborhood base** (or **[local base](@entry_id:155805)**) at $x$ if for every neighborhood $N \in \mathcal{N}_x$, there exists a set $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ such that $B \subseteq N$.

For example, in $\mathbb{R}^n$, the collection of all [open balls](@entry_id:143668) $\{B(x, \epsilon) \mid \epsilon > 0\}$ forms a neighborhood base at $x$. The collection of [open balls](@entry_id:143668) with rational radii $\{B(x, q) \mid q \in \mathbb{Q}^+\}$ is also a valid, but countable, neighborhood base.

Specifying a neighborhood base for each point is sufficient to define a topology. A set $U$ is open if for every $x \in U$, there is a base element $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ such that $B \subseteq U$.

This approach allows for the construction of fascinating and non-intuitive topologies. A classic example is the **Sorgenfrey line**, the space $\mathbb{R}$ where the neighborhood base at each point $x$ is the collection of all half-open intervals of the form $[x, x+\epsilon)$ for $\epsilon > 0$ [@problem_id:1571455] [@problem_id:1571490]. An arbitrary neighborhood $N$ of $x$ is then any set containing such an interval $[x, x+\epsilon)$.

This seemingly small change from [open intervals](@entry_id:157577) $(x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon)$ to half-[open intervals](@entry_id:157577) $[x, x+\epsilon)$ has profound consequences for the space's properties:
- **Hausdorff:** The Sorgenfrey line is Hausdorff. For any two distinct points $a < b$, we can choose the disjoint neighborhoods $[a, b)$ for $a$ and $[b, b+1)$ for $b$.
- **Not Connected:** The space is [totally disconnected](@entry_id:149247). For any $a \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $(-\infty, a)$ is open, and the set $[a, \infty) = \bigcup_{x \ge a} [x, x+1)$ is also open. Their union is $\mathbb{R}$ and they are disjoint, so they form a separation of the space.
- **Convergence:** Convergence is different. The sequence $x_n = -1/n$ for odd $n$ and $1/n$ for even $n$ does not converge to $0$. Any neighborhood of $0$ must contain an interval $[0, \epsilon)$, but the sequence has infinitely many negative terms that never enter this neighborhood.

### Characterizing Topological Properties with Neighborhoods

The language of neighborhoods is extremely useful for characterizing and comparing topological structures.

**Comparing Topologies:** Consider two topologies $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ on the same set $X$, with corresponding neighborhood systems $\mathcal{N}^{(1)}$ and $\mathcal{N}^{(2)}$. If we know that for every point $x$, $\mathcal{N}_x^{(1)} \subseteq \mathcal{N}_x^{(2)}$, what does this imply about the topologies? Let $U$ be an open set in $\mathcal{T}_1$. By definition, $U \in \mathcal{N}_x^{(1)}$ for all $x \in U$. The given inclusion implies that $U \in \mathcal{N}_x^{(2)}$ for all $x \in U$. This is precisely the condition for $U$ to be open in $\mathcal{T}_2$. Therefore, $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$. The topology $\mathcal{T}_2$ is finer (larger) than $\mathcal{T}_1$. Intuitively, having more neighborhoods at each point makes it "easier" for a set to be a neighborhood of all its points, thus allowing more sets to be open [@problem_id:1571475].

**Separation Axioms:** Many of the [separation axioms](@entry_id:154482), which classify spaces based on their ability to distinguish points and [closed sets](@entry_id:137168), have elegant characterizations in terms of neighborhoods. A space is a **$T_1$ space** if for any distinct points $x, y$, there is an open set containing $x$ but not $y$, and vice-versa. This is equivalent to the condition that all singleton sets $\{x\}$ are closed. In the language of neighborhoods, this has a beautiful equivalent formulation.

**Theorem:** A [topological space](@entry_id:149165) $X$ is a $T_1$ space if and only if for every point $x \in X$, the intersection of all neighborhoods of $x$ is the singleton set $\{x\}$.

Let's illustrate with a space that is not $T_1$ [@problem_id:1571507]. Let $X=\{a,b,c\}$ with the topology $\mathcal{T} = \{\emptyset, X, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\}\}$. To separate $c$ from $a$, we would need an open set containing $c$ but not $a$. The only open set containing $c$ is $X$, which also contains $a$. So the space is not $T_1$. Now let's examine the intersection of neighborhoods. The smallest open set containing $c$ is $X$. Therefore, the only neighborhood of $c$ is $X$ itself. The intersection of all neighborhoods of $c$ is just $X = \{a,b,c\}$, which is not $\{c\}$. This demonstrates the failure of the neighborhood property for a non-$T_1$ space. For point $a$, however, $\{a\}$ is an open set, and thus a neighborhood. Any other neighborhood must contain $\{a\}$. So the intersection of all neighborhoods of $a$ is indeed $\{a\}$. The property must hold for *all* points for the space to be $T_1$.

In conclusion, the concept of a neighborhood provides a complete and powerful foundation for [general topology](@entry_id:152375). It bridges the gap between the global, abstract definition of open sets and the local, intuitive notion of nearness, providing essential tools for constructing, analyzing, and comparing topological spaces.
