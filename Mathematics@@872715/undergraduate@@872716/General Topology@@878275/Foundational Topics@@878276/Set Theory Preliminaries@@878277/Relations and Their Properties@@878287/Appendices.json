We test each option for being symmetric and transitive but not reflexive.\n\nFor $R_{A}=\\emptyset$: Symmetry holds vacuously because there is no $(x,y)\\in R_{A}$ to violate the condition. Transitivity holds vacuously because there are no $(x,y),(y,z)\\in R_{A}$ to require $(x,z)$. It is not reflexive because $(a,a)$, $(b,b)$, and $(c,c)$ are not in $R_{A}$.

Since the task requires not reflexive, $R_{B}$ does not qualify.

For transitivity, the only nontrivial composition is $(a,b)$ and $(b,c)$, which implies $(a,c)$ and this is in $R_{C}$; no other composition applies, so it is transitive.

Therefore $R_{E}$ does not qualify.\n\nFor $R_{F}=\\{(b,c),(c,b)\\}$: It is not reflexive because no $(x,x)$ is present. It is symmetric because $(b,c)$ and $(c,b)$ occur as a pair.
