This first exercise provides a clear and intuitive example of a space that is *not* sequentially compact.

Choose the correct option and justification.\n\nA. Yes, because $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is a complete metric space, and all complete metric spaces are sequentially compact.\n\nB. Yes, because any convergent sequence in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ whose points all lie in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ must have a limit in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nC. No, because the sequence defined by $s_n = (n, 0)$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$ is a sequence in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ that does not have any convergent subsequence.\n\nD. No, because $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is not an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nE.

In a metric subspace, a sequence converges to a point of the subspace if and only if it converges to that point in the ambient metric space. Thus, convergence in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is the same as convergence in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ to a point of $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we record a structural fact about $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. For any two distinct points $p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, one has\n$$\nd(p,q)\\geq 1,\n$$\nbecause their coordinates are integers. Hence, any Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is eventually constant: given $\\varepsilon=\\frac{1}{2}$, there exists $N$ such that for all $m,n\\geq N$, $d(x_{m},x_{n})<\\frac{1}{2}$; but since distinct points are at distance at least $1$, this forces $x_{n}$ to be equal for all $n\\geq N$. In particular, any convergent sequence in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is eventually constant.\n\nTo decide sequential compactness, it suffices to exhibit a sequence in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ with no convergent subsequence. Consider $s_{n}=(n,0)$ for $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Any subsequence $(s_{n_{k}})$ has $n_{k}\\to\\infty$, so it is unbounded in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Since every convergent sequence in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is bounded, no subsequence of $(s_{n})$ can converge in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and therefore none can converge in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. Equivalently, by the eventual-constancy observation above, no subsequence of $(s_{n})$ can be eventually constant (each term is distinct), so no subsequence converges.\n\nThus, $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is not sequentially compact. Among the options, C provides the correct counterexample and justification. Options A and B are incorrect (completeness alone does not imply sequential compactness, and the fact about limits of convergent sequences does not guarantee existence of convergent subsequences); D is irrelevant; E states a true property but does not by itself establish failure of sequential compactness without an explicit sequence, which C supplies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1574464"}, {"introduction": "Having seen an example that fails, let's now construct one that succeeds.

No, $S$ is not sequentially compact because the ambient space $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is not bounded, and therefore not sequentially compact.\n\nC. Yes, $S$ is sequentially compact because any sequence of matrices in $S$ gives rise to bounded sequences of real numbers as its diagonal entries, which must have convergent subsequences whose limits define a matrix within $S$.\n\nD.
