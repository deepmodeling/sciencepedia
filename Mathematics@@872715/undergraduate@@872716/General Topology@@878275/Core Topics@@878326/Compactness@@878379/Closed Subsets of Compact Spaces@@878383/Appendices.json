Let $(x_{n})$ be any sequence with $x_{n} \\in A$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nStep 1 (Existence of a convergent subsequence in $X$): By compactness of $X$ and sequential compactness, there exists a subsequence $(x_{n_{k}})$ and a point $x \\in X$ such that\n$$\n\\forall \\varepsilon > 0 \\ \\exists K \\in \\mathbb{N} \\ \\forall k \\geq K:\\ d(x_{n_{k}},x) < \\varepsilon.\n$$\n\nStep 2 (Closedness of $A$ forces the limit into $A$): Since $x_{n_{k}} \\in A$ for all $k$ and $A$ is closed, the limit of any convergent sequence contained in $A$ must lie in $A$. Hence $x \\in A$.\n\nThis proves that statement A is guaranteed to be true: there is a subsequence of $(x_{n})$ that converges to a point in $A$.\n\nWe now show that the other statements are not guaranteed:\n\nB is false in general: Consider $X = [0,1]$ with the usual metric and $A = X$. Define $x_{n} = 0$ for even $n$ and $x_{n} = 1$ for odd $n$. Then $(x_{n})$ does not converge, since for any putative limit $L$, the subsequences along even and odd indices would have to converge to the same $L$, but they converge to $0$ and $1$ respectively.\n\nC is false in general: The same example yields\n$$\nd(x_{n},x_{m}) = 1 \\quad \\text{whenever $n$ and $m$ have different parity,}\n$$\nso $(x_{n})$ is not Cauchy.\n\nD is false in this setting: We already showed every convergent subsequence has its limit in $A$ due to closedness. To see why the phrase “not necessarily in $A$” fails, suppose $(x_{n_{k}}) \\to y \\in X \\setminus A$. Since $A$ is closed, $X \\setminus A$ is open, so there exists $r > 0$ with the open ball $B_{r}(y) \\subset X \\setminus A$.
