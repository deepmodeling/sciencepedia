This is the circle of radius 1 centered at $(1,0)$, with the point at the origin removed.\n$B = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid (x+1)^2 + y^2 = 1\\} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$.

The closure of a set is the set itself plus all of its limit points.\nLet's find the closure of $A$. The points in $A$ are all limit points of $A$. We need to check for limit points of $A$ that are not in $A$. The only point that was removed from the full circle $C_1$ to create $A$ is the origin $P=(0,0)$. Let's determine if $P$ is a limit point of $A$. A point $p$ is a limit point of a set $S$ if every open ball centered at $p$ contains at least one point from $S$ other than $p$. Any open ball centered at the origin $(0,0)$ will contain a small arc of the circle $C_1$ that passes through the origin. This arc contains infinitely many points from $C_1$ arbitrarily close to $(0,0)$, and these points are not $(0,0)$ itself. Therefore, these points belong to $A$. Thus, the origin $(0,0)$ is a limit point of $A$. Since the full circle $C_1$ is a closed set, there are no other limit points of $A$ outside of $C_1$.\nThe closure of $A$ is therefore $\\bar{A} = A \\cup \\{(0,0)\\}$, which is the complete circle $C_1$.\n$\\bar{A} = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1\\}$.\n\nBy a symmetrical argument for the set $B$ and the circle $C_2$, the origin $(0,0)$ is the only limit point of $B$ not contained in $B$.\nThe closure of $B$ is therefore $\\bar{B} = B \\cup \\{(0,0)\\}$, which is the complete circle $C_2$.\n$\\bar{B} = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid (x+1)^2 + y^2 = 1\\}$.\n\nNow we apply the definition of separated sets. We must check two conditions.\n\nCondition 1: Is $\\bar{A} \\cap B = \\emptyset$?\nWe have $\\bar{A} = C_1$ and $B = C_2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$.\nSo, we are checking if $C_1 \\cap (C_2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\})$ is empty.\nThe intersection of the full circles $C_1$ and $C_2$ is just the single point they have in common, the origin $(0,0)$. So, $C_1 \\cap C_2 = \\{(0,0)\\}$.\nThe set $B$ is the circle $C_2$ with the origin removed. Therefore, the intersection of $C_1$ with $B$ cannot contain the origin. Since the origin is the only point of intersection between $C_1$ and $C_2$, the intersection of $C_1$ with $B$ must be empty.\n$\\bar{A} \\cap B = C_1 \\cap (C_2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}) = (C_1 \\cap C_2) \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} = \\{(0,0)\\} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} = \\emptyset$.\nThe first condition is satisfied.\n\nCondition 2: Is $A \\cap \\bar{B} = \\emptyset$?\nWe have $A = C_1 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ and $\\bar{B} = C_2$.\nSo, we are checking if $(C_1 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}) \\cap C_2$ is empty.\nThis is equivalent to $(C_1 \\cap C_2) \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$.\nAs before, $C_1 \\cap C_2 = \\{(0,0)\\}$.\nSo, $A \\cap \\bar{B} = \\{(0,0)\\} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} = \\emptyset$.\nThe second condition is also satisfied.\n\nSince both conditions $\\bar{A} \\cap B = \\emptyset$ and $A \\cap \\bar{B} = \\emptyset$ are true, the sets $A$ and $B$ are separated.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\nA. $A$ and $B$ are not separated because their closures, $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$, have a non-empty intersection.\nThis is false.

The conclusion that they are not separated is incorrect. This option tests a common misconception.\n\nB. $A$ and $B$ are not separated because neither $A$ nor $B$ is a closed set.\nThis is false. The premise that they are not closed is true (since their closures contain a point not in the sets themselves), but this property is not what determines if they are separated. The conclusion that they are \"not separated\" is also false.\n\nC. $A$ and $B$ are separated because the sets $A$ and $B$ are disjoint.\nThis is false.
