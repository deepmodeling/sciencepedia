A topological space is defined as **connected** if it cannot be represented as the disjoint union of two non-empty open subsets.

Replace, in the path $\\ell$, the subsegment $[a_{p},b_{p}]$ with a path on the sphere $S(p,r_{p})$ joining $a_{p}$ to $b_{p}$. This is possible because for $n\\ge 2$, the sphere $S(p,r_{p})$ is homeomorphic to $S^{n-1}$ with $n-1\\ge 1$, hence is path-connected.\n\nPerform this replacement for each $p\\in \\ell\\cap S$. Since the closed balls are pairwise disjoint, these modifications do not interfere with one another.
