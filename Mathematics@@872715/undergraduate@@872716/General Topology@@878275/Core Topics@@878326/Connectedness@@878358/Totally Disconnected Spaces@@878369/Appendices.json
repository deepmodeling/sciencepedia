We must decide whether $A$ is totally disconnected, i.e., whether every nonempty connected subset of $A$ is a singleton.\n\nFirst, we show that $A$ is countable. Consider the rational parametrization of $S^{1}$ by lines through $(-1,0)$ with rational slope. For $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$, the line through $(-1,0)$ with slope $t$ has equation $y=t(x+1)$.

Since $C\\subset S^{1}\\setminus\\{z\\}$ is connected and has more than one point, $C$ is uncountable.\n\nCombining these facts, any connected subset of $A$ with more than one point would be a connected subset of $S^{1}$ with more than one point, hence uncountable, which is impossible because $A$ is countable.

Since $r(A)\\subset\\mathbb{Q}$ and the only connected subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ contained in $\\mathbb{Q}$ are singletons, it follows that $r$ is constant on $A$.
