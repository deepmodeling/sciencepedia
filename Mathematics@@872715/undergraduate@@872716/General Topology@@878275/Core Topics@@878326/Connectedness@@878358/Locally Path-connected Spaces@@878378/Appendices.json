A path in this space is a continuous map $f:[0,1]\\to \\mathbb{R}$, where $[0,1]$ has the usual topology.\n\nFirst, determine the compact subsets of $(\\mathbb{R},\\tau_{f})$. Let $K\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ be infinite. Consider the open cover $\\{\\,\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{x\\}\\,:\\,x\\in K\\,\\}$ of $K$. For any finite subfamily $\\{\\,\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{x_{1}\\},\\dots,\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{x_{n}\\}\\,\\}$, the union is $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}\\}$, which does not contain the points $\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}\\}\\cap K$, so it fails to cover $K$. Hence no finite subcover exists and $K$ is not compact. Therefore, the only compact subsets are finite sets.\n\nNow let $f:[0,1]\\to (\\mathbb{R},\\tau_{f})$ be continuous. Since $[0,1]$ is compact and continuous images of compact sets are compact, $f([0,1])$ is compact in $(\\mathbb{R},\\tau_{f})$, hence finite. Also, $[0,1]$ is connected and continuous images of connected sets are connected, so $f([0,1])$ must be a connected finite subset. We show that any finite subset $A\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ with $|A|\\geq 2$ is disconnected in the subspace topology: for each $a\\in A$, the set $\\{a\\}$ is open in $A$ because $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus(A\\setminus\\{a\\})$ is open in $\\tau_{f}$ (its complement is finite) and $(\\mathbb{R}\\setminus(A\\setminus\\{a\\}))\\cap A=\\{a\\}$. Thus the subspace topology on $A$ is discrete, so $A$ is disconnected when $|A|\\geq 2$. Consequently, the only connected finite subsets are singletons. Therefore $f([0,1])$ must be a singleton, and every path is constant.\n\nIt follows that no two distinct points in $(\\mathbb{R},\\tau_{f})$ can be joined by a path, so no nonempty open subset is path-connected. The only path-connected subsets are singletons, but singletons are not open in $\\tau_{f}$ because their complements are infinite and thus not finite.

Then $U \\subset L_{n}$ and is an open neighborhood of $p$ in $B$. Being an open sub-arc of a line segment, $U$ is path-connected. Thus every such $p$ is locally path-connected.\n\nThe same argument applies to the bristle endpoints $p=(1,1/n)$: for fixed $n$, the distances to the $x$-axis and to other bristles are strictly positive, so a small enough Euclidean ball intersects $B$ only in a sub-arc of $L_{n}$; hence $p$ has a basis of open path-connected neighborhoods.\n\n2) The origin is locally path-connected.\n\nLet $p=(0,0)$. For any $r>0$, consider $U=B \\cap B(p,r)$, which is an open neighborhood of $p$ in $B$. For any two points $a,b \\in U$, the straight segments $[a,p] \\subset L_{n}$ (for the appropriate $n$ or the handle) and $[p,b]$ lie in $B$, and since $B(p,r)$ is convex, both segments lie inside $B(p,r)$. Hence $U$ is path-connected. Therefore taking $V=U$ shows $B$ is locally path-connected at the origin.\n\n3) Points on the handle away from the origin are not locally path-connected.\n\nFix $p=(x,0)$ with $0<x \\leq 1$. Choose $r$ with $0<r<x/2$. Let $U=B \\cap B(p,r)$, an open neighborhood of $p$ in $B$ that does not contain the origin. For each $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, the distance from $p$ to the line $y=(1/m)x$ is\n$$\nd_{m}(p)=\\frac{|-(1/m)x+0|}{\\sqrt{(1/m)^{2}+1}}=\\frac{x/m}{\\sqrt{1+m^{2}}}=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+m^{2}}}.\n$$\nAs $m \\to \\infty$, $d_{m}(p) \\to 0$, so for any such $r$ there exists $m$ with $d_{m}(p)<r$. Thus $U$ contains points from infinitely many bristles $L_{m}$.\n\nSuppose $V$ is any neighborhood of $p$ with $V \\subseteq U$ and path-connected. As a neighborhood in $B$, $V$ contains some open set $B \\cap W$ with $p \\in W$ open in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, hence contains $B \\cap B(p,\\rho)$ for some $0<\\rho \\leq r$. By the same distance estimate, $B \\cap B(p,\\rho)$ contains points from some bristle $L_{m}$, all of which are disjoint from the handle inside $U$ because $U$ does not contain the origin and bristles meet the handle only at $(0,0)$. Therefore no path in $B$ from $p$ to any point of $L_{m} \\cap U$ can lie inside $U$, so $V \\subseteq U$ cannot be path-connected if it contains both $p$ and such bristle points. To keep $V$ path-connected and contain $p$, one would have to exclude all bristle points, but then $V$ cannot be a neighborhood of $p$ in $B$ because every open neighborhood of $p$ in $B$ contains bristle points. Hence no path-connected neighborhood of $p$ exists inside $U$, so $B$ is not locally path-connected at $p$.\n\nConclusion: $B$ is locally path-connected at all points except those on the handle with $0<x\\leq 1$.
