Similar to the argument in part B, this inequality implies that any finite $\\epsilon$-net for the totally bounded space $(X, d_A)$ is also a finite $\\epsilon$-net for $(X, d_D)$.

Both $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ satisfy the triangle inequality (each equality case above is tight), and since $X$ is finite, both $(X,d_{1})$ and $(X,d_{2})$ are totally bounded.

For example, if $d_{1}=d_{2}$ (which is permitted, and each is totally bounded), then for any $x\\neq y$ we have $d_{E}(x,y)=0$, violating identity of indiscernibles.

The core of the question is to determine whether $X$ is a Baire space. A space is a Baire space if and only if it is not a meager set. A set is meager if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets. Therefore, our task is to determine if $X$ can be written as a countable union of nowhere dense subsets of itself.\n\nFirst, let's recall the properties of the set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. The set $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable. Since $X = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 1]$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$, $X$ is also a countable set. This means we can enumerate all the elements of $X$ as a sequence: $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots\\}$.\n\nWe can express the entire space $X$ as a countable union of singleton sets, where each set contains exactly one of its elements:\n$$X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\{x_n\\}$$\nNow, we need to determine if each singleton set $\\{x_n\\}$ is a nowhere dense subset of $X$.

The closure of a closed set is the set itself. Therefore, the closure of $A_n = \\{x_n\\}$ in the space $X$ is $\\overline{A_n} = \\{x_n\\}$.\n\n2.  **Find the interior of the closure, $\\text{int}(\\overline{A_n})$.**\n    Since $\\overline{A_n} = \\{x_n\\}$, we need to find the interior of $\\{x_n\\}$ in the space $X$. A point $p$ is in the interior of a set $S$ if there exists an open ball centered at $p$ that is fully contained within $S$.\n    Let's consider an arbitrary open ball centered at $x_n$ in the metric space $(X,d)$. An open ball of radius $\\epsilon  0$ centered at $x_n$ is defined as $B(x_n, \\epsilon) = \\{y \\in X \\mid d(x_n, y)  \\epsilon\\}$. This is equivalent to $\\{y \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1] \\mid |x_n - y|  \\epsilon\\}$, which can also be written as $(x_n - \\epsilon, x_n + \\epsilon) \\cap X$.\n    The set of rational numbers is dense in the set of real numbers. This means that for any two distinct real numbers, there is a rational number between them. Consequently, for any $\\epsilon  0$, the open interval $(x_n - \\epsilon, x_n + \\epsilon)$ contains infinitely many rational numbers. Thus, the open ball $B(x_n, \\epsilon)$ in $X$ contains infinitely many points of $X$, not just the single point $x_n$.\n    Therefore, for any $\\epsilon  0$, the open ball $B(x_n, \\epsilon)$ is not a subset of $\\{x_n\\}$.

The space $X$ is a Baire space because total boundedness is a sufficient condition for the conclusion of the Baire Category Theorem to hold. This is false. The first part of the statement (\"X is a Baire space\") is incorrect. The reasoning is also flawed; the Baire Category Theorem requires completeness, and this example shows that total boundedness is not a sufficient substitute.\nD. Every open subset of $X$ is dense in $X$. This is false. Consider the open set $U = (0, 1/2) \\cap X$. This set is non-empty and open in $X$. However, it is not dense in $X$.
