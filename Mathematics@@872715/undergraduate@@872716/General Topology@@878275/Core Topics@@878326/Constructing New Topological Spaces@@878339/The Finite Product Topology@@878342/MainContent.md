## Introduction
In topology, a fundamental task is to construct new [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056) from existing ones. One of the most important and natural methods for doing so is by taking the Cartesian product of spaces. But how does one equip this new product set with a topology that meaningfully reflects the structure of its original components? Simply taking products of open sets doesn't always yield a valid topology, presenting a knowledge gap that requires a more rigorous construction. This article addresses this by providing a comprehensive introduction to the [finite product topology](@entry_id:155445), a foundational concept in [general topology](@entry_id:152375) and beyond.

Over the next three sections, you will gain a thorough understanding of this essential construction.
- The **"Principles and Mechanisms"** section will introduce the formal definition of the product topology via a basis, explore its equivalent characterization through a [universal property](@entry_id:145831) involving projection maps, and investigate which key [topological properties](@entry_id:154666), such as the Hausdorff condition and connectedness, are preserved under this operation.
- In **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,"** we will see how this abstract definition provides the natural topological framework for [multivariable systems](@entry_id:169616) like Euclidean space, serves as a bridge to algebra and geometry by preserving invariants, and is used to construct vital counterexamples that clarify the boundaries of major theorems.
- Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** section will offer a curated set of problems designed to solidify your understanding and allow you to apply these concepts to concrete examples.

We begin by formalizing the intuition behind creating a topology on a product of sets.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Having introduced the concept of constructing new topological spaces from existing ones, we now delve into one of the most fundamental constructions: the [product space](@entry_id:151533). This chapter will formalize the notion of the [finite product topology](@entry_id:155445), explore its defining characteristics, and investigate how key topological properties behave under this construction.

### The Definition of the Product Topology

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be two [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056). The Cartesian product of the sets $X$ and $Y$, denoted $X \times Y$, is the set of all [ordered pairs](@entry_id:269702) $(x, y)$ such that $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$. Our goal is to endow this product set with a "natural" topology that reflects the topologies of its constituent spaces, $X$ and $Y$.

What constitutes a natural topology? Intuitively, we want open sets in $X \times Y$ to be built from the open sets of $X$ and $Y$. The most straightforward approach is to consider "open rectangles," which are sets of the form $U \times V$, where $U$ is an open set in $X$ and $V$ is an open set in $Y$. While the collection of all such sets is not always a topology itself (the union of two rectangles is not necessarily a rectangle), it forms an excellent foundation.

We define the **basis for the product topology** on $X \times Y$ to be the collection of all sets of the form $U \times V$, where $U \in \mathcal{T}_X$ and $V \in \mathcal{T}_Y$.
$$
\mathcal{B} = \{ U \times V \mid U \in \mathcal{T}_X, V \in \mathcal{T}_Y \}
$$
The **[product topology](@entry_id:154786)** on $X \times Y$ is the topology generated by this basis $\mathcal{B}$. This means that a subset $W \subseteq X \times Y$ is open in the product topology if and only if for every point $(x, y) \in W$, there exists a basis element $U \times V \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $(x, y) \in U \times V \subseteq W$.

A simple but illustrative example arises when the factor spaces have the [discrete topology](@entry_id:152622). Let $X$ and $Y$ be non-empty sets, each endowed with the [discrete topology](@entry_id:152622), where every subset is open. To determine the [product topology](@entry_id:154786) on $Z = X \times Y$, we examine its basis. For any point $(x, y) \in Z$, the singleton set $\{x\}$ is open in $X$ and $\{y\}$ is open in $Y$. Therefore, their product, $\{(x, y)\} = \{x\} \times \{y\}$, is a basic open set in the product topology. Since every point $(x,y)$ constitutes an open set, any subset $A \subseteq Z$ can be expressed as the union of its constituent singletons, $A = \bigcup_{(x,y) \in A} \{(x,y)\}$. As the union of open sets is always open, every subset $A$ of $Z$ is open. This means the product topology on $Z$ is also the discrete topology [@problem_id:1565769].

The most familiar example is the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. The product topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, where each factor has the [standard topology](@entry_id:152252), is precisely the [standard topology](@entry_id:152252) on $\mathbb{R}^2$. The basis elements are open rectangles $(a, b) \times (c, d)$. While the [standard topology](@entry_id:152252) on $\mathbb{R}^2$ is often introduced using a basis of open disks (from the Euclidean metric $d_2$), the topology generated is the same. The key insight is that any open disk contains an open rectangle around each of its points, and conversely, any open rectangle contains an open disk around each of its points. This demonstrates that different-looking bases can generate identical topologies. For instance, the topology induced by the Euclidean metric is equivalent to that induced by the **maximum metric**, $d_{\infty}((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \max\{|x_1 - x_2|, |y_1 - y_2|\}$, whose [open balls](@entry_id:143668) are open squares. The set $S = (-2, 2) \times (-2, 2)$ is an open ball of radius $2$ in the maximum metric, but it is also an open set in the Euclidean topology. One can verify that for a point like $p = (1, -1.5)$ inside $S$, the largest open Euclidean disk centered at $p$ and contained in $S$ has a radius equal to the shortest distance from $p$ to the boundary of the square, which is $0.5$ [@problem_id:1581355]. This interchangeability of basic open sets is the essence of [topological equivalence](@entry_id:144076).

### The Universal Property of the Product Topology

An alternative, more abstract perspective defines the [product topology](@entry_id:154786) through its relationship with functions. This approach is powerful because it characterizes the topology by what it *does* rather than by how it is built.

Consider the two canonical **projection maps**:
$$
\pi_X: X \times Y \to X, \quad \text{given by} \quad \pi_X(x, y) = x
$$
$$
\pi_Y: X \times Y \to Y, \quad \text{given by} \quad \pi_Y(x, y) = y
$$
The product topology can be uniquely characterized as the **[coarsest topology](@entry_id:149974)** on the set $X \times Y$ that makes both projection maps, $\pi_X$ and $\pi_Y$, continuous. "Coarsest" means it has the fewest open sets possible to satisfy this condition. For $\pi_X$ to be continuous, the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) of any open set $U \subseteq X$ must be open in $X \times Y$. This preimage is $\pi_X^{-1}(U) = U \times Y$. Similarly, for $\pi_Y$ to be continuous, $\pi_Y^{-1}(V) = X \times V$ must be open for any open $V \subseteq Y$. The collection of all such sets $\{U \times Y, X \times V\}$ forms a **[subbasis](@entry_id:151637)** for the product topology. The basis we defined earlier is generated by taking finite intersections of these [subbasis](@entry_id:151637) elements: $(U \times Y) \cap (X \times V) = U \times V$.

This "[universal property](@entry_id:145831)" has a crucial corollary concerning maps *into* a product space.

**Theorem (Continuity into a Product):** Let $Z$ be a topological space. A function $h: Z \to X \times Y$ is continuous if and only if its component functions $f = \pi_X \circ h: Z \to X$ and $g = \pi_Y \circ h: Z \to Y$ are both continuous.

*Proof:*
($\Rightarrow$) If $h$ is continuous, then since $\pi_X$ and $\pi_Y$ are continuous, the compositions $f = \pi_X \circ h$ and $g = \pi_Y \circ h$ are continuous.

($\Leftarrow$) Assume $f$ and $g$ are continuous. To show $h$ is continuous, we need to show that the preimage of any basic open set in $X \times Y$ is open in $Z$. Let $U \times V$ be a basic open set in $X \times Y$. The [preimage](@entry_id:150899) under $h$ is:
$$
h^{-1}(U \times V) = \{z \in Z \mid h(z) \in U \times V\}
$$
$$
= \{z \in Z \mid f(z) \in U \text{ and } g(z) \in V\}
$$
$$
= \{z \in Z \mid f(z) \in U\} \cap \{z \in Z \mid g(z) \in V\} = f^{-1}(U) \cap g^{-1}(V)
$$
Since $f$ is continuous, $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $Z$. Since $g$ is continuous, $g^{-1}(V)$ is open in $Z$. The intersection of two open sets is open, so $h^{-1}(U \times V)$ is open in $Z$. This proves that $h$ is continuous. The logic extends easily to arbitrary open sets, which are unions of basis elements, as the preimage of a union is the union of preimages [@problem_id:1581357].

This theorem is immensely practical. It allows us to establish the continuity of a map into a [product space](@entry_id:151533) by simply checking the continuity of its simpler component functions.

### Preservation of Topological Properties

A central question in topology is which properties of spaces are preserved when we form products. For finite products, many important properties are indeed preserved.

#### Separation Axioms

A topological space $X$ is **Hausdorff** (or $T_2$) if for any two distinct points $x, y \in X$, there exist [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704) $U$ and $V$ with $x \in U$ and $y \in V$.

**Theorem:** The [product space](@entry_id:151533) $X \times Y$ is Hausdorff if and only if both $X$ and $Y$ are Hausdorff.

*Proof:*
($\Rightarrow$) Assume $X \times Y$ is Hausdorff. Let $x_1, x_2$ be distinct points in $X$. Choose any point $y \in Y$. Then $(x_1, y)$ and $(x_2, y)$ are distinct points in $X \times Y$. By the Hausdorff property, there exist disjoint open sets $W_1, W_2 \subseteq X \times Y$ containing $(x_1, y)$ and $(x_2, y)$ respectively. By definition of the product topology, we can find basic open sets $U_1 \times V_1 \subseteq W_1$ and $U_2 \times V_2 \subseteq W_2$ containing the respective points. Thus $x_1 \in U_1$, $x_2 \in U_2$. If $U_1$ and $U_2$ were not disjoint, say $z \in U_1 \cap U_2$, then we could find a point $y' \in V_1 \cap V_2$ (since $y \in V_1 \cap V_2$, the intersection is non-empty). This would mean $(z, y') \in (U_1 \times V_1) \cap (U_2 \times V_2) \subseteq W_1 \cap W_2$, contradicting that $W_1$ and $W_2$ are disjoint. Thus $U_1 \cap U_2 = \emptyset$, and $X$ is Hausdorff. A symmetric argument shows $Y$ is Hausdorff.

($\Leftarrow$) Assume $X$ and $Y$ are Hausdorff. Let $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ be distinct points in $X \times Y$. Then either $x_1 \neq x_2$ or $y_1 \neq y_2$. If $x_1 \neq x_2$, there exist disjoint open sets $U_1, U_2$ in $X$ containing $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then $U_1 \times Y$ and $U_2 \times Y$ are disjoint open neighborhoods of $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. If $y_1 \neq y_2$, a similar construction with $X \times V_1$ and $X \times V_2$ works. If both $x_1 \neq x_2$ and $y_1 \neq y_2$, we can find disjoint neighborhoods $U_1, U_2$ in $X$ and $V_1, V_2$ in $Y$. Then $U_1 \times V_1$ and $U_2 \times V_2$ are disjoint open neighborhoods of the points in the product.

The Hausdorff property has an elegant formulation in terms of the product space $X \times X$. The **diagonal** of $X$ is the set $\Delta = \{(x,x) \mid x \in X\}$.

**Theorem:** A space $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if its diagonal $\Delta$ is a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) in $X \times X$.

*Proof:* A set is closed if and only if its complement is open. The complement of the diagonal is $(X \times X) \setminus \Delta$, the set of pairs of distinct points.
($\Rightarrow$) Assume $X$ is Hausdorff. We show $(X \times X) \setminus \Delta$ is open. Let $(x,y) \in (X \times X) \setminus \Delta$, which means $x \neq y$. Since $X$ is Hausdorff, there exist [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704) $U, V \subseteq X$ with $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. The set $U \times V$ is an [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) of $(x,y)$ in $X \times X$. Furthermore, because $U \cap V = \emptyset$, no point of the form $(z,z)$ can be in $U \times V$. Thus, $U \times V \subseteq (X \times X) \setminus \Delta$. Since we can find such an open neighborhood around every point of the complement, the complement is open, and $\Delta$ is closed.

($\Leftarrow$) Assume $\Delta$ is closed, so its complement $(X \times X) \setminus \Delta$ is open. Let $x, y$ be distinct points in $X$. Then $(x,y) \in (X \times X) \setminus \Delta$. Since this set is open, there exists a basic open set $U \times V$ containing $(x,y)$ that is fully contained in the complement. This means $x \in U$, $y \in V$, and $(U \times V) \cap \Delta = \emptyset$. The condition $(U \times V) \cap \Delta = \emptyset$ implies that there is no point $z$ such that $(z,z) \in U \times V$, which means there is no $z \in U \cap V$. Therefore, $U$ and $V$ are disjoint open neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$, proving that $X$ is Hausdorff.

This theorem tells us that for any space that is not Hausdorff, such as a set with at least two points under the [indiscrete topology](@entry_id:149604) or the Sierpiński space, its diagonal will not be a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) in the product square [@problem_id:1581337].

#### Connectedness Properties

**Theorem:** A product space $X \times Y$ is **path-connected** if and only if both $X$ and $Y$ are path-connected (assuming $X, Y$ are non-empty).

*Proof:*
($\Rightarrow$) Assume $X \times Y$ is path-connected. To show $X$ is path-connected, let $x_1, x_2$ be two points in $X$. Since $Y$ is non-empty, we can pick a point $y \in Y$. Then $(x_1, y)$ and $(x_2, y)$ are points in $X \times Y$. By assumption, there exists a continuous path $h: [0, 1] \to X \times Y$ with $h(0)=(x_1, y)$ and $h(1)=(x_2, y)$. The component map $f = \pi_X \circ h: [0, 1] \to X$ is continuous (as a composition of [continuous maps](@entry_id:153855)) and satisfies $f(0) = x_1$ and $f(1) = x_2$. This is a path from $x_1$ to $x_2$ in $X$. Thus $X$ is path-connected. A symmetric argument shows $Y$ is path-connected.

($\Leftarrow$) Assume $X$ and $Y$ are path-connected. Let $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ be two points in $X \times Y$. There exists a path $f: [0, 1] \to X$ from $x_1$ to $x_2$, and a path $g: [0, 1] \to Y$ from $y_1$ to $y_2$. We can define a map $h: [0, 1] \to X \times Y$ by $h(t) = (f(t), g(t))$. By the [universal property](@entry_id:145831) of continuity, $h$ is continuous because its component functions $f$ and $g$ are continuous. Moreover, $h(0)=(f(0), g(0))=(x_1, y_1)$ and $h(1)=(f(1), g(1))=(x_2, y_2)$. Thus $h$ is a path between the two points in $X \times Y$, so the product space is path-connected [@problem_id:1581354].

A similar, though slightly more involved, proof shows that $X \times Y$ is **connected** if and only if $X$ and $Y$ are connected.

#### Separability

A space is **separable** if it contains a [countable dense subset](@entry_id:147670). This property also behaves well with finite products.

**Theorem:** If $X$ and $Y$ are [separable spaces](@entry_id:150486), then $X \times Y$ is separable.

*Proof:* Let $A$ be a [countable dense subset](@entry_id:147670) of $X$ and $B$ be a [countable dense subset](@entry_id:147670) of $Y$. We claim that $A \times B$ is a [countable dense subset](@entry_id:147670) of $X \times Y$. The set $A \times B$ is countable because it is the Cartesian product of two [countable sets](@entry_id:138676) ($|A \times B| = |A| \times |B|$). To show it is dense, we must show that it intersects every non-empty open set in $X \times Y$. It suffices to check against non-empty basic open sets $U \times V$. Since $A$ is dense in $X$, $U \cap A \neq \emptyset$. Since $B$ is dense in $Y$, $V \cap B \neq \emptyset$. Let $a \in U \cap A$ and $b \in V \cap B$. Then $(a,b) \in (U \times V) \cap (A \times B)$. Thus, $A \times B$ is dense in $X \times Y$.

This theorem is very powerful. For example, since the set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is a [countable dense subset](@entry_id:147670) of $\mathbb{R}$ (in both the standard and lower-limit topologies), we can immediately conclude that $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$ is a [countable dense subset](@entry_id:147670) of [product spaces](@entry_id:151693) like $\mathbb{R}^2 = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ and the Sorgenfrey plane $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$ [@problem_id:1581330].

### Behavior of Subsets and Maps

Finally, we examine how fundamental topological constructions like [closures](@entry_id:747387), sequences, and subspaces interact with the product structure.

#### Convergence of Sequences

The [product topology](@entry_id:154786) makes sequential convergence particularly intuitive.

**Theorem:** A sequence of points $(p_n) = ((x_n, y_n))$ converges to a point $p = (x, y)$ in the [product space](@entry_id:151533) $X \times Y$ if and only if the sequence of components $(x_n)$ converges to $x$ in $X$ and the sequence $(y_n)$ converges to $y$ in $Y$.

*Proof:*
($\Rightarrow$) Assume $(x_n, y_n) \to (x,y)$. The projection map $\pi_X: X \times Y \to X$ is continuous. Since [continuous maps](@entry_id:153855) preserve sequential convergence, $\pi_X((x_n, y_n)) \to \pi_X((x,y))$, which is to say $x_n \to x$. Similarly, using the continuous projection $\pi_Y$, we find $y_n \to y$.

($\Leftarrow$) Assume $x_n \to x$ and $y_n \to y$. Let $W$ be any open neighborhood of $(x,y)$ in $X \times Y$. There must exist a basic open set $U \times V$ such that $(x,y) \in U \times V \subseteq W$. Since $x_n \to x$, there exists an integer $N_X$ such that for all $n \ge N_X$, $x_n \in U$. Similarly, there exists $N_Y$ such that for all $n \ge N_Y$, $y_n \in V$. Let $N = \max\{N_X, N_Y\}$. Then for all $n \ge N$, we have $x_n \in U$ and $y_n \in V$, which implies $(x_n, y_n) \in U \times V \subseteq W$. This proves that $(x_n, y_n) \to (x,y)$ [@problem_id:1581366].

#### Closure and Density

The closure operator interacts very simply with the product construction.

**Theorem:** For any subsets $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq Y$, the closure of their product is the product of their closures:
$$
\overline{A \times B} = \bar{A} \times \bar{B}
$$

*Proof:*
($\subseteq$) Let $(x,y) \in \overline{A \times B}$. Consider any basic neighborhood $U \times V$ of $(x,y)$. By definition of closure, this neighborhood must intersect $A \times B$. This means there is some $(a,b) \in (U \times V) \cap (A \times B)$. So $a \in U \cap A$ and $b \in V \cap B$. In particular, any open set $U$ containing $x$ must intersect $A$, and any open set $V$ containing $y$ must intersect $B$. This means $x \in \bar{A}$ and $y \in \bar{B}$. Therefore, $(x,y) \in \bar{A} \times \bar{B}$.

($\supseteq$) Let $(x,y) \in \bar{A} \times \bar{B}$. This means $x \in \bar{A}$ and $y \in \bar{B}$. Consider any basic [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) $U \times V$ of $(x,y)$. Since $x \in \bar{A}$, the neighborhood $U$ of $x$ must intersect $A$. Since $y \in \bar{B}$, the neighborhood $V$ of $y$ must intersect $B$. Let $a \in U \cap A$ and $b \in V \cap B$. Then $(a,b) \in (U \times V) \cap (A \times B)$, so the intersection is non-empty. This shows every neighborhood of $(x,y)$ intersects $A \times B$, so $(x,y) \in \overline{A \times B}$ [@problem_id:1581333].

As a direct consequence of this theorem and the definition of a [dense set](@entry_id:142889) ($\bar{S} = T$), we have that $A \times B$ is dense in $X \times Y$ if and only if $A$ is dense in $X$ and $B$ is dense in $Y$ [@problem_id:1581343]. However, one must be cautious: not all [dense subsets](@entry_id:264458) of a product space are themselves product sets. For instance, the "antidiagonal" line $S = \{(x, -x) \mid x \in \mathbb{R}\}$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and thus is not dense. More subtly, a set like $D = (\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{R}) \cup (\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{Q})$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^2$, but it cannot be written in the form $A \times B$ for any subsets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ [@problem_id:1581343].

#### Subspaces and Projections

The product topology is also well-behaved with respect to subspaces. If $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq Y$ are given the subspace topologies, the product topology on $A \times B$ is identical to the subspace topology that $A \times B$ inherits as a subset of $X \times Y$. This is because the basis elements of both topologies coincide: an intersection of a product-open set with the subspace, $(O_X \times O_Y) \cap (A \times B)$, is precisely $(O_X \cap A) \times (O_Y \cap B)$, which is a product of subspace-open sets [@problem_id:1581369]. This convenient fact allows us to move seamlessly between these two points of view.

Finally, we return to the projection maps. As a direct consequence of the definition of the basis, the projection maps are always **open maps**.

**Theorem:** The projections $\pi_X: X \times Y \to X$ and $\pi_Y: X \times Y \to Y$ are open maps.

*Proof:* Let $W \subseteq X \times Y$ be an open set. We must show its image $\pi_X(W)$ is open in $X$. Let $x \in \pi_X(W)$. By definition, there exists some $y \in Y$ such that $(x,y) \in W$. Since $W$ is open, there is a basic open set $U \times V$ such that $(x,y) \in U \times V \subseteq W$. The projection of this basic set is $\pi_X(U \times V) = U$. The inclusion implies $\pi_X(U \times V) \subseteq \pi_X(W)$, so $U \subseteq \pi_X(W)$. We have found an open set $U$ in $X$ such that $x \in U \subseteq \pi_X(W)$. This means $\pi_X(W)$ is a neighborhood of each of its points, so it is open. A symmetric argument holds for $\pi_Y$.

However, projection maps are **not** generally closed maps. A classic [counterexample](@entry_id:148660) is the hyperbola $C = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid xy = 1\}$. This set is closed in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (it's the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) of the closed set $\{1\}$ under the continuous multiplication map). But its projection onto the first coordinate is $\pi_X(C) = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$, which is not a closed set in $\mathbb{R}$ [@problem_id:1581338]. A similar phenomenon can be observed in other spaces, such as finding a closed set in $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}_l$ whose projection onto $\mathbb{R}$ is the [open interval](@entry_id:144029) $(0, \infty)$ [@problem_id:1581313]. The important lesson is that projections reliably preserve openness but not closedness. The property that makes projections closed is compactness: a projection from $X \times K$ to $X$ is a [closed map](@entry_id:150357) if $K$ is a compact space, a result known as the Tube Lemma, which will be explored in a later chapter.
