This is the identity map from the standard topology to the discrete topology. This map is *not* continuous. To see why, consider the open set $\\{a\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}_{\\text{disc}}$. Its preimage under this map is $\\{a\\}$, which is not an open set in $\\mathbb{R}_{\\text{std}}$.\nSince one of the component maps is not continuous, the map $\\Delta$ is not continuous. Thus, A is false and B is true.\n\n**Openness of $\\Delta$:**\nAn open map sends open sets to open sets. Let $U = (0,1)$ be an open set in $\\mathbb{R}_{\\text{std}}$. Its image is $\\Delta(U) = \\{(x,x) \\mid x \\in (0,1)\\}$. This is a line segment on the diagonal in $X$. This set is not open in $X$. For example, consider the point $(0.5, 0.5) \\in \\Delta(U)$. Any basic open neighborhood of this point has the form $V \\times S$, where $V$ is a standard open interval containing $0.5$ and $S$ is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ containing $0.5$. If we take $S = \\{0.5\\}$, then $V \\times \\{0.5\\}$ is a neighborhood of $(0.5, 0.5)$. If $V$ contains any point $z \\neq 0.5$, then $(z, 0.5) \\in V \\times \\{0.5\\}$, but $(z, 0.5) \\notin \\Delta(U)$ because its coordinates are not equal. This reasoning is flawed; we need to show no open set contains it. A better argument: any open neighborhood of $(0.5, 0.5)$ must contain a set $V \\times S$. If we pick $S=\\{0.5, 0.6\\}$, which is open in $\\mathbb{R}_{\\text{disc}}$, then the neighborhood contains points like $(0.5, 0.6)$ which are not in $\\Delta(U)$. No neighborhood of $(0.5,0.5)$ is contained within $\\Delta(U)$. Therefore, $\\Delta(U)$ is not open. Thus, $\\Delta$ is not an open map, and C is false.\n\n**Closedness of $\\Delta$:**\nA map is closed if it sends closed sets to closed sets. We first show that the image of $\\Delta$, the diagonal $D = \\{(x,x) \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$, is a closed set in $X = \\mathbb{R}_{\\text{std}} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{\\text{disc}}$. To do this, we show its complement $X \\setminus D$ is open. Let $(a,b) \\in X \\setminus D$, which means $a \\neq b$. Let $U = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{b\\}$. Since single-point sets are closed in the standard topology, $U$ is an open neighborhood of $a$ in $\\mathbb{R}_{\\text{std}}$. In the discrete topology on the second factor, the singleton set $S = \\{b\\}$ is an open neighborhood of $b$. Therefore, $U \\times S$ is an open neighborhood of $(a,b)$ in the product space $X$. For any point $(x,y) \\in U \\times S$, we have $x \\in U$ (so $x \\neq b$) and $y \\in S$ (so $y=b$). This implies $x \\neq y$, so $(x,y) \\notin D$. Thus, $U \\times S \\subseteq X \\setminus D$, proving that $X \\setminus D$ is open and $D$ is closed.\n\nNow, let $F$ be any closed set in the domain $\\mathbb{R}_{\\text{std}}$. We want to show that its image $\\Delta(F)$ is closed in $X$. The image is $\\Delta(F) = \\{(x,x) \\mid x \\in F\\}$. We can write this set as an intersection:\n$$ \\Delta(F) = D \\cap (F \\times \\mathbb{R}) $$\nWe have already shown that $D$ is a closed set in $X$. The set $F \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is the preimage of the closed set $F$ under the continuous projection map $\\pi_1: X \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\text{std}}$ (i.e., $F \\times \\mathbb{R} = \\pi_1^{-1}(F)$). Since the preimage of a closed set under a continuous map is closed, $F \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is a closed set in $X$.\n\nSince $\\Delta(F)$ is the intersection of two closed sets, it is also closed.
