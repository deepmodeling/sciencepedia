A set $S$ is considered open in a subspace $Y$ of a topological space $X$ if and only if $S$ can be expressed as the intersection of an open set in $X$ with the subspace $Y$. In our case, $X=\\mathbb{R}$ and $Y = [0, 2] \\cup (3, 5]$. So, a set $S \\subseteq Y$ is open in $Y$ if there exists an open set $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ such that $S = U \\cap Y$.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. $S_A = [0, 1]$**\nThis set is not open in $Y$. To show this, we examine the point $s = 1 \\in S_A$. Any open set $U$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ containing $1$ must contain an open interval $(1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. The intersection $U \\cap Y$ must contain $(1 - \\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon) \\cap Y$, which for small enough $\\epsilon$ is $(1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon)$. This intersection contains points greater than $1$, which are not in $S_A$. Thus, no neighborhood of $1$ within $Y$ is contained in $S_A$, so $S_A$ is not open in $Y$.\n\n**B. $S_B = \\{0, 4\\}$**\nThis set is not open in $Y$. Let's consider the point $s = 0 \\in S_B$. Any open set $U$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ containing $0$ must contain an interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. The intersection $U \\cap Y$ contains $[0, \\epsilon)$, which includes points other than $0$. Since this neighborhood is not a subset of $\\{0, 4\\}$, $S_B$ is not open.\n\n**C. $S_C = [0, 2]$**\nThis set is open in $Y$. To demonstrate this, we need to find an open set $U$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $S_C = U \\cap Y$. Let's choose the open interval $U = (-1, 3)$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. The intersection of $U$ with $Y$ is:\n$$U \\cap Y = (-1, 3) \\cap ([0, 2] \\cup (3, 5])$$\nThe numbers in $(-1, 3)$ that are also in $Y$ are precisely those in the interval $[0, 2]$. The interval $(3, 5]$ has no points in common with $(-1, 3)$.\nTherefore, $U \\cap Y = [0, 2] = S_C$.\nSince we have found an open set $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ such that $S_C = U \\cap Y$, the set $S_C$ is, by definition, open in the subspace $Y$.\n\n**D. $S_D = (3, 4]$**\nThis set is not open in $Y$. Let's test the endpoint $s = 4 \\in S_D$. Any open set $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ containing $4$ must contain an interval $(4 - \\epsilon, 4 + \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. The neighborhood of $4$ in $Y$ is $U \\cap Y$, which contains points greater than $4$ (e.g., $4 + \\epsilon/2$ for small $\\epsilon$). These points are not in $S_D$, so $S_D$ is not open.\n\n**E. $S_E = \\{5\\}$**\nThis set is not open in $Y$. Let's test the point $s = 5 \\in S_E$. Let $U$ be any open set in $\\mathbb{R}$ containing $5$, for instance, $U = (4.9, 5.1)$. The intersection of $U$ with $Y$ is $U \\cap Y = (4.9, 5]$. This set contains infinitely many points other than $5$, so it is not a subset of $S_E=\\{5\\}$.
