For completeness, we prove both cases directly.\n\nStatement I: Assume $A$ and $B$ are closed and $f|_{A}$ and $f|_{B}$ are continuous. To show $f$ is continuous, it suffices to show that $f^{-1}(C)$ is closed in $X$ for every closed $C\\subseteq Y$. Since $f|_{A}$ is continuous, $(f|_{A})^{-1}(C)$ is closed in $A$, hence there exists a closed $F_{A}\\subseteq X$ such that\n$$(f|_{A})^{-1}(C)=A\\cap F_{A}.$$\nSimilarly, there exists a closed $F_{B}\\subseteq X$ such that\n$$(f|_{B})^{-1}(C)=B\\cap F_{B}.$$\nWe have\n$$f^{-1}(C)=(f|_{A})^{-1}(C)\\cup(f|_{B})^{-1}(C)=(A\\cap F_{A})\\cup(B\\cap F_{B}).$$\nBecause $A$ and $B$ are closed in $X$, $A\\cap F_{A}$ and $B\\cap F_{B}$ are closed in $X$, and the union of finitely many closed sets is closed.

To show $f$ is continuous, it suffices to show that $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$ for every open $U\\subseteq Y$. Continuity of the restrictions gives $(f|_{A})^{-1}(U)$ open in $A$ and $(f|_{B})^{-1}(U)$ open in $B$. By definition of the subspace topology, there exist open sets $W_{A},W_{B}\\subseteq X$ with\n$$(f|_{A})^{-1}(U)=A\\cap W_{A},\\quad (f|_{B})^{-1}(U)=B\\cap W_{B}.$$\nThen\n$$f^{-1}(U)=(f|_{A})^{-1}(U)\\cup(f|_{B})^{-1}(U)=(A\\cap W_{A})\\cup(B\\cap W_{B}).$$\nSince $A$ and $B$ are open in $X$, $A\\cap W_{A}$ and $B\\cap W_{B}$ are open in $X$, and their union is open. Hence $f^{-1}(U)$ is open, proving $f$ is continuous. Thus Statement II is true.\n\nFor closed maps we recall the definition: $f$ is a closed map if for every closed $C\\subseteq X$, the image $f(C)$ is closed in $Y$. We use the finite cover $X=A\\cup B$ and the fact that if $C$ is closed in $X$, then $C\\cap A$ is closed in $A$ and $C\\cap B$ is closed in $B$ (subspace topology), regardless of whether $A$ and $B$ are open or closed in $X$.\n\nStatement III: Assume $A$ and $B$ are closed and $f|_{A}$ and $f|_{B}$ are closed maps. Let $C\\subseteq X$ be closed. Then $C\\cap A$ is closed in $A$ and $C\\cap B$ is closed in $B$, so closedness of the restrictions yields\n$$f(C\\cap A)=f|_{A}(C\\cap A)\\ \\text{closed in }Y,\\quad f(C\\cap B)=f|_{B}(C\\cap B)\\ \\text{closed in }Y.$$\nSince\n$$f(C)=f\\big((C\\cap A)\\cup(C\\cap B)\\big)=f(C\\cap A)\\cup f(C\\cap B),$$\nand a finite union of closed sets is closed, $f(C)$ is closed in $Y$.

Then $C\\cap A$ is closed in $A$ and $C\\cap B$ is closed in $B$, so again\n$$f(C\\cap A),\\ f(C\\cap B)\\ \\text{are closed in }Y,$$\nand\n$$f(C)=f(C\\cap A)\\cup f(C\\cap B)$$\nis a finite union of closed sets, hence closed in $Y$.
