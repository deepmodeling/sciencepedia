This means that any interval around a real number $c$ contains both rational and irrational numbers. Therefore, for the limit $\\lim_{x\\to c} f(x)$ to exist, the value that $f(x)$ approaches must be the same whether $x$ approaches $c$ through a sequence of rational numbers or a sequence of irrational numbers.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary point $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nLet $(q_n)$ be a sequence of rational numbers such that $q_n \\to c$ as $n \\to \\infty$.

We can solve for $c$:\n$$c^2 - c = 0$$\n$$c(c-1) = 0$$\nThe solutions are $c=0$ and $c=1$. Thus, the function can only be continuous at $x=0$ and $x=1$. We must now formally check if it is indeed continuous at these two points.\n\n**Case 1: Test for continuity at $c=0$.**\nSince $0$ is a rational number, $f(0)=0$.\nFrom our analysis above, the limit as we approach $0$ through rationals is $0$, and the limit as we approach through irrationals is $0^2=0$. Since both limits agree, $\\lim_{x\\to 0} f(x) = 0$.\nBecause $\\lim_{x\\to 0} f(x) = 0 = f(0)$, the function is continuous at $x=0$.\n\n**Case 2: Test for continuity at $c=1$.**\nSince $1$ is a rational number, $f(1)=1$.\nFrom our analysis above, the limit as we approach $1$ through rationals is $1$, and the limit as we approach through irrationals is $1^2=1$. Since both limits agree, $\\lim_{x\\to 1} f(x) = 1$.\nBecause $\\lim_{x\\to 1} f(x) = 1 = f(1)$, the function is continuous at $x=1$.\n\n**Case 3: Test for continuity at any other point $c \\notin \\{0, 1\\}$.**\nIf $c$ is any real number other than $0$ or $1$, then $c \\neq c^2$.\nAs we showed, if we approach $c$ via a sequence of rational numbers, the function values approach $c$.
