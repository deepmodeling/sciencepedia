The continuity of $h$ cannot be determined from the continuity of $f$ and $g$ alone; it requires additional information about the specific topologies on $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.", "solution": "The correct statement is D. We need to prove that the function $h: X \\to Y \\times Z$ defined by $h(x) = (f(x), g(x))$ is continuous if and only if both component functions $f: X \\to Y$ and $g: X \\to Z$ are continuous. This is a standard and fundamental result in point-set topology concerning the product topology.\n\nWe will prove both directions of the \"if and only if\" statement.\n\n**Part 1: Assume $f$ and $g$ are continuous. Show that $h$ is continuous.**\n\nTo show that $h$ is continuous, we must show that for any open set $W$ in the product space $Y \\times Z$, its preimage $h^{-1}(W)$ is open in $X$. The product topology on $Y \\times Z$ is defined by a basis consisting of all sets of the form $U \\times V$, where $U$ is an open set in $Y$ and $V$ is an open set in $Z$. To prove continuity, it is sufficient to show that the preimage of any of these basis elements is open in $X$.\n\nLet $U \\times V$ be an arbitrary basis element for the product topology on $Y \\times Z$, where $U \\subseteq Y$ is open and $V \\subseteq Z$ is open. Let's compute the preimage of this set under $h$:\n$$h^{-1}(U \\times V) = \\{x \\in X \\mid h(x) \\in U \\times V\\}$$\nBy the definition of $h(x)$, this is:\n$$h^{-1}(U \\times V) = \\{x \\in X \\mid (f(x), g(x)) \\in U \\times V\\}$$\nFor a point $(f(x), g(x))$ to be in the Cartesian product $U \\times V$, it must be that $f(x) \\in U$ and $g(x) \\in V$. So we can rewrite the set as:\n$$h^{-1}(U \\times V) = \\{x \\in X \\mid f(x) \\in U \\text{ and } g(x) \\in V\\}$$\nThis can be expressed as the intersection of two sets:\n$$h^{-1}(U \\times V) = \\{x \\in X \\mid f(x) \\in U\\} \\cap \\{x \\in X \\mid g(x) \\in V\\}$$\nThe first set is the preimage of $U$ under $f$, which is $f^{-1}(U)$. The second set is the preimage of $V$ under $g$, which is $g^{-1}(V)$. So,\n$$h^{-1}(U \\times V) = f^{-1}(U) \\cap g^{-1}(V)$$\nBy our initial assumption, the function $f$ is continuous. Since $U$ is an open set in $Y$, its preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ must be an open set in $X$.\nSimilarly, since the function $g$ is continuous and $V$ is an open set in $Z$, its preimage $g^{-1}(V)$ must be an open set in $X$.\n\nIn a topological space, the intersection of a finite number of open sets is always open. Therefore, the set $f^{-1}(U) \\cap g^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$.\nSince we have shown that the preimage of any basis element of the product topology is open in $X$, the function $h$ is continuous.\n\n**Part 2: Assume $h$ is continuous. Show that $f$ and $g$ are continuous.**\n\nThis direction of the proof relies on the continuity of the projection maps. Let $\\pi_Y: Y \\times Z \\to Y$ be the projection map defined by $\\pi_Y(y, z) = y$, and let $\\pi_Z: Y \\times Z \\to Z$ be the projection map defined by $\\pi_Z(y, z) = z$. A fundamental property of the product topology is that both projection maps, $\\pi_Y$ and $\\pi_Z$, are continuous.\n\nWe can express the component functions $f$ and $g$ in terms of $h$ and these projection maps.\nFor any $x \\in X$:\n$$(\\pi_Y \\circ h)(x) = \\pi_Y(h(x)) = \\pi_Y(f(x), g(x)) = f(x)$$\nThus, $f = \\pi_Y \\circ h$.\nSimilarly, for any $x \\in X$:\n$$(\\pi_Z \\circ h)(x) = \\pi_Z(h(x)) = \\pi_Z(f(x), g(x)) = g(x)$$\nThus, $g = \\pi_Z \\circ h$.\n\nWe are given that $h: X \\to Y \\times Z$ is continuous. As established, the projection map $\\pi_Y: Y \\times Z \\to Y$ is also continuous. The function $f$ is the composition of these two continuous functions ($f = \\pi_Y \\circ h$). The composition of two continuous functions is always continuous. Therefore, $f$ must be continuous.\n\nBy the same logic, the function $g$ is the composition of the continuous function $h$ and the continuous projection map $\\pi_Z$ ($g = \\pi_Z \\circ h$). Therefore, $g$ must also be continuous.\n\nCombining both parts, we have demonstrated that $h$ is continuous if and only if both $f$ and $g$ are continuous. This makes statement D the correct choice.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\nA. The continuity of $h$ is an intrinsic property related to $f$ and $g$, not an extrinsic property of the space $X$ like compactness.\nB. If $f$ is continuous but $g$ is not, then $g = \\pi_Z \\circ h$. If $h$ were continuous, this would imply $g$ is continuous (as a composition of continuous maps), leading to a contradiction. So, one continuous component is not sufficient.\nC. This is incorrect. If either $f$ or $g$ is not continuous, then as shown above, $h$ cannot be continuous.\nE. This is false. The proof above shows that the relationship is a general theorem that holds for any topological spaces $X, Y, Z$ as long as $Y \\times Z$ is given the product topology.
