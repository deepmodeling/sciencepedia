This problem presents a function that is continuous at a single, surprising point, despite its values oscillating between rational and irrational inputs [@problem_id:1544387]. Applying the neighborhood definition rigorously is the key to revealing this counter-intuitive property and demonstrating that our formal definitions can uncover truths that graphical intuition might miss.", "problem": "Consider the function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by the rule:\n$$\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\nx  \\text{if } x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\\\\n0  \\text{if } x \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of rational numbers.\n\nWe recall the definition of continuity at a point using neighborhoods: A function $f$ is continuous at a point $c$ if for every neighborhood $V$ of $f(c)$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $c$ such that $f(U) \\subseteq V$.

The function is continuous at $c=0$. For any neighborhood $V = (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ of $f(0)=0$, choosing the neighborhood $U = (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ of $c=0$ guarantees that for any $y \\in U$, its image $f(y)$ is also in $V$.\n\nB. The function is discontinuous at $c=0$.

Since $f(y) \\ne f(z)$, the function's values jump, so it cannot be continuous.\n\nC. The function is continuous at $c=0$ because the line $y=x$ and the line $y=0$ intersect at $x=0$, which is the only point where the two rules for the function agree.\n\nD. The function is discontinuous at $c=0$. Let $V = (-0.5, 0.5)$ be a neighborhood of $f(0)=0$.

The function is continuous at $c=0$. This is because for rational numbers, the function $g(x)=x$ is continuous, and for irrational numbers, the function $h(x)=0$ is continuous.
