Urysohn's Lemma can be generalized to show that any two disjoint closed sets in $X$ can be separated by a continuous function, implying normality.", "solution": "The correct evaluation of the proposition is that it is false. We need to find a counterexample: a space $X$ that is the union of two closed T4 subspaces but is not itself T4.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the requirements for a space to be T4. It must be both T1 and normal. It is a standard result in topology that if a space $X$ is the union of a finite collection of closed subspaces, each of which is T1, then $X$ itself is T1. In our case, $X = A \\cup B$, where $A$ and $B$ are closed T1 subspaces (since they are T4). Therefore, $X$ must be a T1 space. This eliminates option B, which claims the T1 property might fail.\n\nThe failure point of the proposition must lie in the normality condition. A finite union of closed normal subspaces is not necessarily normal. We need to find a space $X$ that is T1 but not normal, which can be expressed as the union of two closed, normal (and T1, i.e., T4) subspaces.\n\nA classic counterexample is the Sorgenfrey plane. Let's construct it and verify the properties.\n\n1.  **The Sorgenfrey Line ($S$):** This is the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ equipped with the lower-limit topology, where the basis for the topology is the set of all half-open intervals of the form $[a, b)$ for $a  b$. The Sorgenfrey line $S$ is a T4 space (it is T1, and it is also Lindelöf and regular, which implies it is normal).\n\n2.  **The Sorgenfrey Plane ($P$):** This is the product space $P = S \\times S$. The basis for the topology on $P$ consists of rectangles of the form $[a, b) \\times [c, d)$. The Sorgenfrey plane $P$ is a T1 space. However, it is a famous result that $P$ is **not** a normal space. A common way to show this is by considering the \"anti-diagonal\" $L = \\{(x, -x) \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. The sets $C_1 = \\{(x, -x) \\in L \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}$ and $C_2 = \\{(x, -x) \\in L \\mid x \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\}$ are disjoint closed sets in $P$ that cannot be separated by disjoint open sets. Since $P$ is not normal, it cannot be a T4 space.\n\n3.  **Decomposing the Sorgenfrey Plane:** Now, we check if $P$ can be written as the union of two closed T4 subspaces. Let's define two subsets of $P$:\n    $$A = \\{(x,y) \\in P \\mid x+y \\ge 0\\}$$\n    $$B = \\{(x,y) \\in P \\mid x+y \\le 0\\}$$\n    Clearly, $A \\cup B = P$.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Properties of the Subspaces A and B:**\n    -   **Are A and B closed in P?** The function $f(x,y) = x+y$ is not continuous on the Sorgenfrey plane, so we cannot simply use preimages. We must show the complements are open. Consider $A^c = \\{(x,y) \\in P \\mid x+y  0\\}$. For any point $(x_0, y_0) \\in A^c$, we have $x_0+y_0  0$. Let $\\eta = -(x_0+y_0) > 0$. We need to find a basic open set $U = [x_0, x_0+\\epsilon) \\times [y_0, y_0+\\delta)$ around $(x_0, y_0)$ that is fully contained in $A^c$. Let's choose $\\epsilon = \\delta = \\eta/2$. For any point $(x,y) \\in U$, we have $x  x_0 + \\eta/2$ and $y  y_0 + \\eta/2$. Adding these inequalities gives $x+y  (x_0+y_0) + \\eta = (x_0+y_0) - (x_0+y_0) = 0$. Thus, every point in $U$ is in $A^c$, so $U \\subseteq A^c$. This shows $A^c$ is open, which means $A$ is closed. A similar argument shows that the complement of $B$, $B^c = \\{(x,y) \\in P \\mid x+y > 0\\}$, is also open, so $B$ is closed.\n    -   **Are A and B T4 subspaces?** As subspaces of the T1 space $P$, both $A$ and $B$ are T1. The proof that both $A$ and $B$ are normal is a non-trivial result in topology. However, accepting this known result, we can conclude that both $A$ and $B$ are T4 spaces in their respective subspace topologies.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We have found a space $P$ (the Sorgenfrey plane) which is not T4 (because it is not normal). However, $P$ is the union of two subspaces $A$ and $B$ which are both closed in $P$ and are themselves T4 spaces. This serves as a direct counterexample to the proposition.\n\nTherefore, the proposition is false, and the reason for its failure is that a union of two closed normal subspaces is not guaranteed to be normal. This matches option C. Option A and D are incorrect because the proposition is false. Option B is incorrect because the T1 property is preserved in this construction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1589798"}]}
