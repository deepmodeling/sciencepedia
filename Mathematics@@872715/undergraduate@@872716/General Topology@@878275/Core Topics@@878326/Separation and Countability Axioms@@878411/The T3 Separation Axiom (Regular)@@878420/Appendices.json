For any integers $a$ and $b$ with $b > 0$, we define an arithmetic progression as the set $S(a,b) = \\{a + nb \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The collection of all such sets, $\\mathcal{B} = \\{S(a,b) \\mid a \\in \\mathbb{Z}, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}, b > 0\\}$, forms a basis for a topology on $\\mathbb{Z}$, which we will call $\\tau$.\n\nIn general topology, a topological space is defined as a **T3 space** if it satisfies two conditions:\n1.  It is a **T1 space**: For any two distinct points $x$ and $y$ in the space, there exists an open set containing $x$ but not $y$. (An equivalent condition is that every singleton set $\\{x\\}$ is a closed set).\n2.  It is a **regular space**: For any closed set $C$ and any point $p$ not in $C$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $p \\in U$ and $C \\subseteq V$.\n\nBased on these definitions, determine if the topological space $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is a T3 space.\n\nA. Yes, $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is a T3 space.\n\nB. No, because $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is not a T1 space.\n\nC. No, because $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is a T1 space but is not regular.\n\nD.

For any $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ and any $b0$, we have $x\\in S(x,b)$, so the union of sets in $\\mathcal{B}$ covers $\\mathbb{Z}$. For the basis intersection property, let $x\\in S(a,b)\\cap S(c,d)$. Then $x=a+mb=c+nd$ for some $m,n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, hence $x-a\\in b\\mathbb{Z}$ and $x-c\\in d\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $e=\\operatorname{lcm}(b,d)$. Since $e\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq b\\mathbb{Z}$ and $e\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq d\\mathbb{Z}$, for any $y\\in S(x,e)$ there exists $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ with $y=x+ke$, so $y-a=(x-a)+ke\\in b\\mathbb{Z}$ and $y-c=(x-c)+ke\\in d\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus $S(x,e)\\subseteq S(a,b)\\cap S(c,d)$. Therefore $\\mathcal{B}$ is a valid basis and $\\tau$ is a topology generated by $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nNext we show $(\\mathbb{Z},\\tau)$ is a $\\mathrm{T1}$ space. Given distinct $m,n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, define $b=|m-n|+1$. Then $m\\not\\equiv n\\pmod{b}$, so the basic open sets $S(m,b)$ and $S(n,b)$ are disjoint and contain $m$ and $n$ respectively. In particular, for any distinct $x,y$ there is an open set containing $x$ but not $y$, so $(\\mathbb{Z},\\tau)$ is $\\mathrm{T1}$ (indeed Hausdorff).\n\nWe now prove regularity.

The space $L$ is not a T3 space because while it is regular, it is not a T1 space.", "solution": "To determine if the space $L$ is a T3 space, we must check if it satisfies both the T1 and regular separation axioms.\n\n**Step 1: Check if the space $L$ is T1.**\nA space is T1 if for any two distinct points, each has a neighborhood not containing the other. Let's consider all pairs of distinct points $x, y \\in L$.\n\nCase 1: $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. We can choose disjoint open intervals $(a_x, b_x)$ containing $x$ and $(a_y, b_y)$ containing $y$, just as in the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$. These intervals are basis elements for the topology on $L$, so they are open sets. Thus, the T1 axiom holds for these points.\n\nCase 2: One point is $p_1$ and the other is $x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Let $\\epsilon = |x|/2 > 0$. The set $U_{1, \\epsilon} = ((-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{p_1\\}$ is a basic open neighborhood of $p_1$. By our choice of $\\epsilon$, $x \\notin U_{1, \\epsilon}$. Also, we can find a small open interval neighborhood of $x$, for example $(x - \\epsilon_x, x + \\epsilon_x)$ for a small enough $\\epsilon_x > 0$, that does not contain $p_1$. Thus, $p_1$ and $x$ can be separated. The same argument applies to $p_2$ and any $x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nCase 3: The two points are $p_1$ and $p_2$. The set $U_{1,1} = ((-1, 1) \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{p_1\\}$ is an open neighborhood of $p_1$ that does not contain $p_2$. Similarly, the set $U_{2,1} = ((-1, 1) \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{p_2\\}$ is an open neighborhood of $p_2$ that does not contain $p_1$.\n\nSince the T1 axiom holds for all pairs of distinct points, the space $L$ is a T1 space. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n**Step 2: Check if the space $L$ is regular.**\nA space is regular if for any closed set $C$ and any point $p \\notin C$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $p \\in U$ and $C \\subseteq V$. To show that $L$ is not regular, we need to find a single counterexample.\n\nLet's test the separation of the point $p_1$ from the set $\\{p_2\\}$.\nFirst, we must establish that $\\{p_2\\}$ is a closed set. A set is closed if its complement is open. The complement of $\\{p_2\\}$ is $L \\setminus \\{p_2\\} = (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{p_1\\}$.\n- For any point $x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, we can find a basic open interval $(a,b)$ containing $x$ that is entirely within $L \\setminus \\{p_2\\}$.\n- For the point $p_1$, any basic open set $U_{1, \\epsilon}$ containing it is, by definition, a subset of $L \\setminus \\{p_2\\}$.\nSince every point in $L \\setminus \\{p_2\\}$ has an open neighborhood contained within $L \\setminus \\{p_2\\}$, the complement is an open set. Therefore, $\\{p_2\\}$ is a closed set.\n\nNow, let's take the point $p = p_1$ and the closed set $C = \\{p_2\\}$. We have $p \\notin C$. We need to see if we can find disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $p_1 \\in U$ and $\\{p_2\\} \\subseteq V$.\n\nLet $U$ be any open set containing $p_1$. By the definition of the basis for the topology, $U$ must contain a basic open set of the form $U_{1, \\epsilon} = ((-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{p_1\\}$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nLet $V$ be any open set containing $p_2$. Similarly, $V$ must contain a basic open set of the form $U_{2, \\delta} = ((-\\delta, \\delta) \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{p_2\\}$ for some $\\delta > 0$.\n\nNow, let's examine the intersection of $U$ and $V$.\n$$U \\cap V \\supseteq U_{1, \\epsilon} \\cap U_{2, \\delta}$$\n$$U_{1, \\epsilon} \\cap U_{2, \\delta} = [((-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{p_1\\}] \\cap [((-\\delta, \\delta) \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{p_2\\}]$$\nThe intersection of these two sets is the intersection of their non-origin parts, since $p_1 \\neq p_2$.\n$$U_{1, \\epsilon} \\cap U_{2, \\delta} = ((-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cap ((-\\delta, \\delta) \\setminus \\{0\\})$$\nLet $\\eta = \\min(\\epsilon, \\delta)$. Since $\\epsilon > 0$ and $\\delta > 0$, we have $\\eta > 0$. The intersection is then $(-\\eta, \\eta) \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This set is non-empty. For instance, it contains the point $\\eta/2$.\n\nThis shows that any open neighborhood $U$ of $p_1$ and any open neighborhood $V$ of $p_2$ must have a non-empty intersection. Therefore, it is impossible to find disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ separating the point $p_1$ from the closed set $\\{p_2\\}$.\n\nConclusion: The space $L$ is not regular.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion.**\nThe space $L$ is a T1 space but it is not a regular space.
