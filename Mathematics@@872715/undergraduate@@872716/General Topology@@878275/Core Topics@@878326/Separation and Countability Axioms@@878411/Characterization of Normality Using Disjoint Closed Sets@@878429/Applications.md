## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the formal definition of normality and its fundamental theoretical consequences—namely Urysohn's Lemma and the Tietze Extension Theorem—we now turn our attention to the application of these principles in diverse mathematical contexts. This chapter aims to demonstrate the utility and significance of normality by exploring how it manifests in concrete examples, where its boundaries lie through the study of key counterexamples, and how it connects to other major branches of mathematics. Our goal is not to re-prove the theorems from the previous chapter, but to see them in action, solidifying our understanding of normality as a crucial, [non-trivial property](@entry_id:262405) of [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056).

### Constructing Separating Sets in Practice

The definition of normality guarantees the existence of separating open sets, but it does not prescribe a universal method for their construction. In practice, finding such sets often depends on the specific structure of the space and the closed sets in question.

In some simple topological spaces, the nature of the topology makes separation trivial. Consider the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ with the [order topology](@entry_id:143222), where a basis is given by [open intervals](@entry_id:157577) $(a, b) = \{z \in \mathbb{Z} \mid a  z  b\}$. In this topology, any singleton set $\{n\}$ is open, since it can be written as the open interval $(n-1, n+1)$. This implies that the topology on $\mathbb{Z}$ is the discrete topology, where every subset is simultaneously open and closed. Consequently, for any two disjoint subsets, such as the set of even integers $E$ and the set of odd integers $O$, the sets themselves serve as the required separating open sets. That is, we can simply choose $U=E$ and $V=O$ to satisfy the conditions $E \subseteq U$, $O \subseteq V$, and $U \cap V = \emptyset$. This illustrates that any discrete space is trivially normal. [@problem_id:1535769]

For [metric spaces](@entry_id:138860), a powerful and general construction for separating sets exists, underpinning the proof that every [metric space](@entry_id:145912) is normal. Given a metric space $(X, d)$ and two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$, the sets $U = \{x \in X \mid d(x, A)  d(x, B)\}$ and $V = \{x \in X \mid d(x, B)  d(x, A)\}$ are disjoint open sets separating $A$ and $B$. For instance, in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the Euclidean metric, let $C$ be the unit circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ and $S$ be the square boundary $\max(|x|, |y|) = 2$. The open set containing the circle $C$ can be explicitly described by the inequality $d((x,y), C)  d((x,y), S)$. A careful analysis shows this inequality is equivalent to $\sqrt{x^2+y^2} + \max(|x|,|y|)  3$. This provides a concrete [geometric realization](@entry_id:265700) of the abstract [separation principle](@entry_id:176134). [@problem_id:1535783]

Even within a single space like $\mathbb{R}^2$, the choice of separating sets is not unique and can be tailored to the geometry of the closed sets. Consider the disjoint closed regions $A = \{(x,y) \mid y \ge x^2+1\}$ and $B = \{(x,y) \mid y \le -x^2-1\}$. Instead of using the metric-based construction, we can propose separating sets based on parabolic boundaries, such as $U_\alpha = \{(x,y) \mid y > \alpha x^2\}$ and $V_\alpha = \{(x,y) \mid y  -\alpha x^2\}$ for some parameter $\alpha > 0$. For these sets to constitute a valid separation, $A$ must be contained in $U_\alpha$, $B$ in $V_\alpha$, and $U_\alpha \cap V_\alpha$ must be empty. The first two conditions both lead to the inequality $x^2+1 > \alpha x^2$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, which holds if and only if $\alpha \le 1$. The third condition, disjointness, holds for all $\alpha > 0$. Thus, any $\alpha \in (0, 1]$ yields a valid separation, demonstrating the flexibility in constructing such sets. [@problem_id:1535779]

The concept of normality and separation extends naturally to infinite-dimensional spaces, such as those encountered in [functional analysis](@entry_id:146220). Let $X = C([0,1])$ be the space of continuous functions on $[0,1]$ with the [supremum metric](@entry_id:142683) $d(f, g) = \sup_{x \in [0,1]} |f(x) - g(x)|$. Consider the set $A$ of non-negative functions and the set $B$ of functions bounded above by $-1$. Both are [disjoint closed sets](@entry_id:152178). The distance between them is $\inf_{a \in A, b \in B} d(a,b) = 1$. One can define $r$-neighborhoods $N_r(S) = \{h \in X \mid \inf_{s \in S} d(h, s)  r\}$ around these sets. For the neighborhoods $N_r(A)$ and $N_r(B)$ to be disjoint, the [triangle inequality](@entry_id:143750) requires that the distance between the sets, 1, must satisfy $1 \ge 2r$, which implies $r \le 1/2$. Thus, the supremum of radii $r$ for which these neighborhoods are disjoint is $1/2$, providing a quantitative measure of their separation. [@problem_id:1535788]

### Consequences of Normality: Urysohn's Lemma and Tietze's Extension Theorem

The true power of normality lies not just in separating sets with other sets, but in separating them with continuous functions. Urysohn's Lemma, which states that [disjoint closed sets](@entry_id:152178) in a normal space can be separated by a continuous function $f: X \to [0,1]$, is a cornerstone of topology.

The proof of Urysohn's Lemma is a beautiful constructive argument that directly leverages the definition of normality. It involves building a family of open sets $\{U_r\}$ indexed by [dyadic rationals](@entry_id:148903) $r \in [0,1]$, such that for $r  s$, $\overline{U_r} \subseteq U_s$. The process begins with $A \subseteq U_1 = X \setminus B$. Since $A$ and $X \setminus U_1$ are disjoint closed sets, normality guarantees an open set $U_0$ such that $A \subseteq U_0$ and $\overline{U_0} \subseteq U_1$. To find the next set, $U_{1/2}$, one considers the [disjoint closed sets](@entry_id:152178) $\overline{U_0}$ and $X \setminus U_1$. Normality is applied again to find an open set, which we call $U_{1/2}$, such that $\overline{U_0} \subseteq U_{1/2}$ and $\overline{U_{1/2}} \subseteq U_1$. This iterative application of the [separation axiom](@entry_id:155057) generates the required nested family of open sets, which then defines the Urysohn function. [@problem_id:1563950]

While the existence of a Urysohn function is guaranteed, constructing one explicitly can be an insightful exercise. Consider the Hilbert cube $H = [0,1]^{\mathbb{N}}$ with the [product topology](@entry_id:154786). Let $A$ be the set of sequences where all even-indexed terms are $0$, and $B$ be the set where all even-indexed terms are $1$. Both are closed and disjoint. A continuous function $f: H \to [0,1]$ separating them can be constructed by focusing only on the even-indexed terms. The function $f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{x_{2k}}{2^k}$ serves this purpose perfectly. It is a uniform limit of continuous functions and thus continuous. For any sequence in $A$, all $x_{2k}=0$, so $f(x)=0$. For any sequence in $B$, all $x_{2k}=1$, so $f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (1/2)^k = 1$. This provides a concrete example of a Urysohn function in an infinite-dimensional setting. [@problem_id:1535772]

A closely related and equally powerful result is the Tietze Extension Theorem, which states that any continuous function from a closed subset of a [normal space](@entry_id:154487) into $\mathbb{R}$ (or $[0,1]$) can be extended to a continuous function on the whole space. This theorem is a direct consequence of normality. For example, consider the closed subset $A = \{1/4, 3/4\}$ of the normal space $[0,1]$. A function $g: A \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by $g(1/4) = 2$ and $g(3/4) = 5$. The Tietze theorem guarantees the existence of a [continuous extension](@entry_id:161021) $G: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$. While infinitely many such extensions exist, a simple one can be constructed by making it linear on $[1/4, 3/4]$ and constant on $[0, 1/4]$ and $[3/4, 1]$. This demonstrates in a tangible way what the theorem promises: the ability to "fill in the gaps" of a function defined on a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) without creating discontinuities. [@problem_id:1535741]

### The Boundaries of Normality: Important Counterexamples

To fully appreciate a property, it is essential to study spaces that lack it. Many important topological spaces are not normal, and the reasons for this failure are highly instructive.

A simple, constructed example is the set $\mathbb{R}$ equipped with the particular point topology at $p=0$, where a set is open if and only if it is empty or contains $0$. In this space, a non-empty set is closed if and only if it does not contain $0$. Consider the disjoint, non-empty, closed sets $C_1 = (-\infty, 0)$ and $C_2 = (0, \infty)$. To separate them, we would need [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704) $U_1$ and $U_2$ containing them. However, any non-empty open set in this topology must contain the point $0$. Since $U_1$ and $U_2$ must be non-empty, both must contain $0$, so their intersection cannot be empty. Therefore, no two non-empty [disjoint closed sets](@entry_id:152178) can be separated, and the space is not normal. [@problem_id:1535764]

More complex and historically significant counterexamples provide deeper insights. The Sorgenfrey plane, $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$, is the product of the real line with the [lower-limit topology](@entry_id:155881) (where basis sets are of the form $[a,b)$). This space is famously not normal. The standard counterexample involves the "anti-diagonal" line $L = \{(x, -x) \mid x \in \mathbb{R}\}$. The subsets of $L$ consisting of points with rational coordinates, $A$, and irrational coordinates, $B$, are both closed in the Sorgenfrey plane. However, it can be proven that any open set containing $A$ must have a closure that intersects $B$, making it impossible to find disjoint open neighborhoods for $A$ and $B$. [@problem_id:1535750]

Another classic example is the Niemytzki plane (or Moore plane), which consists of the [upper half-plane](@entry_id:199119) $\mathbb{R}^2$ with $y \ge 0$. The topology is standard for points with $y>0$, but for points $(x,0)$ on the x-axis, basic neighborhoods are open disks in the upper half-plane tangent to the axis at $(x,0)$. This space is regular but not normal. The [counterexample](@entry_id:148660) is again provided by the partition of a [closed subspace](@entry_id:267213) into rational and irrational points: the set $A$ of points on the x-axis with rational first coordinates and the set $B$ of points with irrational first coordinates are disjoint closed sets that cannot be separated by [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704). Any attempt to envelop all of $A$ in an open set of "tangent disks" will invariably "spill over" and intersect any open set designed to contain $B$. [@problem_id:1584869]

The failure of normality can also occur in very large spaces. Consider the space of all functions $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}}$ with the [product topology](@entry_id:154786). Let $A$ be the set of functions that are zero on all rational numbers, and $B$ be the set of functions that are one on all rational numbers. Both are closed and disjoint. However, they cannot be separated. The reason lies in the nature of the [product topology](@entry_id:154786): any basic open set is defined by constraints on only a finite number of coordinates (i.e., function values at a finite number of points). An open set containing $A$ can only enforce the "zero" condition at a finite number of rational points, leaving it unconstrained elsewhere. One can always construct a function that satisfies the finite constraints of an open set around $A$ and simultaneously satisfies the finite constraints of an open set around $B$, forcing the two open sets to intersect. The basis of the topology is too "coarse" to detect properties defined on an infinite set like $\mathbb{Q}$. [@problem_id:1535784]

### Interdisciplinary Connections and Advanced Perspectives

The property of normality is not an isolated concept; it is a [topological invariant](@entry_id:142028) that plays a role in many other areas of mathematics.

A property is a [topological invariant](@entry_id:142028) if it is preserved under homeomorphisms. A stronger question is whether it is preserved under other types of maps. Normality is, in fact, preserved under continuous, closed, surjective maps. If $f: X \to Y$ is such a map and $X$ is a [normal space](@entry_id:154487), then $Y$ must also be normal. The proof involves taking two disjoint closed sets $B_1, B_2$ in $Y$, considering their closed preimages $A_1, A_2$ in $X$, separating $A_1, A_2$ with disjoint open sets $U_1, U_2$ in $X$, and then carefully constructing corresponding open sets in $Y$ using the fact that $f$ is a [closed map](@entry_id:150357). This result shows that normality is a robust property that can be transferred from one space to another. [@problem_id:1535793]

In algebraic topology, one frequently works with CW-complexes, which are spaces built up inductively by attaching cells of increasing dimension. A fundamental result is that any finite-dimensional CW-complex is normal. The proof proceeds by induction on the dimension of the skeletons. The [inductive step](@entry_id:144594)—showing that if the $(k-1)$-skeleton $X^{k-1}$ is normal, then the $k$-skeleton $X^k$ is also normal—relies crucially on the Tietze Extension Theorem. Given disjoint closed sets $A, B$ in $X^k$, one starts with a Urysohn function on $X^{k-1}$ separating $A \cap X^{k-1}$ and $B \cap X^{k-1}$. To extend this function over a newly attached $k$-cell $D^k$, one defines a function on the union of the cell's boundary and its intersection with $A$ and $B$. Since the disk $D^k$ is normal, the Tietze Extension Theorem guarantees this function can be extended continuously to the whole disk, thereby completing the [inductive step](@entry_id:144594). [@problem_id:1535754]

A deep connection exists between normality and the theory of compactifications. For a Tychonoff space $X$, two [disjoint closed sets](@entry_id:152178) $A$ and $B$ can be separated by a continuous function (and thus are "functionally separated") if and only if their [closures](@entry_id:747387) in the Stone-Čech compactification, $\text{cl}_{\beta X}(A)$ and $\text{cl}_{\beta X}(B)$, are disjoint. The Stone-Čech [compactification](@entry_id:150518) $\beta X$ is itself normal (being compact Hausdorff). This theorem provides an alternative viewpoint: the question of separating sets within $X$ is translated into a question of whether their [closures](@entry_id:747387) "touch" in the larger, universal [compact space](@entry_id:149800) $\beta X$. It follows that a Tychonoff space $X$ is normal if and only if for *every* pair of disjoint closed sets $A, B \subset X$, their [closures](@entry_id:747387) in $\beta X$ are disjoint. [@problem_id:1535808]

Finally, the concepts underlying the proof of normality for certain spaces have found application in seemingly unrelated domains. The proof of Bing's Metrization Theorem, which gives conditions for a space to be metrizable, involves showing that a regular $T_1$ space with a $\sigma$-discrete basis is normal. The construction of the separating sets $U$ and $V$ is intricate, built from sequences of open sets derived from the basis. Although the context may be framed as a hypothetical problem in network monitoring, the underlying algorithm for constructing the "cordon" sets is precisely the one used in this fundamental proof, demonstrating how abstract topological constructions can model complex separation and filtering tasks. [@problem_id:1535766]

In conclusion, the property of normality is far more than a simple definition. It is a powerful tool for constructing continuous functions, a key characteristic that distinguishes between different types of [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056), and a concept that connects [general topology](@entry_id:152375) with [functional analysis](@entry_id:146220), algebraic topology, and advanced theory. The examples and counterexamples explored in this chapter highlight its central role in the topologist's toolkit.
