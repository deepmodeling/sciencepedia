To prove $C$ is not open, we only need to find one point in $C$ that has no open neighborhood fully contained in $C$. Consider the point $(p, q) \\in C$. Any basic open neighborhood of $(p, q)$ is of the form $U \\times V$, where $U$ is an open neighborhood of $p$ and $V$ is an open neighborhood of $q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are not isolated, there exists an $x \\in U$ with $x \\neq p$ and a $y \\in V$ with $y \\neq q$. The point $(x,y)$ is in $U \\times V$. However, since $x \\neq p$ and $y \\neq q$, $(x,y) \\notin C$.
