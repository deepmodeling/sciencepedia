A topological space is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points $x, y \\in X$, there exist open sets $U$ and $V$ in $\\mathcal{T}$ such that $x \\in U$, $y \\in V$, and $U \\cap V = \\emptyset$.\n\nTo prove that the space is not Hausdorff, we only need to find a single pair of distinct points that cannot be separated by disjoint open neighborhoods. Let's consider the two distinct \"origin\" points, $o_1$ and $o_2$.\n\nLet $W_1$ be an arbitrary open neighborhood of the point $o_1$. By the definition of a topology generated by a basis, $W_1$ must contain at least one basis element that contains $o_1$. According to the problem statement, any basis element containing $o_1$ must be of the form $U_\\epsilon(o_1) = (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{o_1\\}$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. So, for some $\\epsilon_1 > 0$, we have $U_{\\epsilon_1}(o_1) \\subseteq W_1$.\n\nSimilarly, let $W_2$ be an arbitrary open neighborhood of the point $o_2$. By the same logic, there must exist a basis element $U_{\\epsilon_2}(o_2) = (-\\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_2) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{o_2\\}$ for some $\\epsilon_2 > 0$ such that $U_{\\epsilon_2}(o_2) \\subseteq W_2$.\n\nNow, let's examine the intersection of these arbitrary neighborhoods, $W_1 \\cap W_2$. If we can show that this intersection is always non-empty, then the points $o_1$ and $o_2$ cannot be separated, and the space is not Hausdorff.\n\nSince $U_{\\epsilon_1}(o_1) \\subseteq W_1$ and $U_{\\epsilon_2}(o_2) \\subseteq W_2$, it follows that $U_{\\epsilon_1}(o_1) \\cap U_{\\epsilon_2}(o_2) \\subseteq W_1 \\cap W_2$. Let's compute the intersection of these two basis elements:\n$$U_{\\epsilon_1}(o_1) \\cap U_{\\epsilon_2}(o_2) = \\left( (-\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_1) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{o_1\\} \\right) \\cap \\left( (-\\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_2) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{o_2\\} \\right)$$\nSince $o_1$ and $o_2$ are distinct points not in $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\{o_1\\} \\cap \\left( (-\\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_2) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{o_2\\} \\right) = \\emptyset$ and $\\left( (-\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_1) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{o_1\\} \\right) \\cap \\{o_2\\} = \\emptyset$.\nThe intersection simplifies to:\n$$ \\left( (-\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_1) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\right) \\cap \\left( (-\\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_2) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\right) $$\nLet $\\epsilon_{\\min} = \\min(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2)$. Since both $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$ are positive, $\\epsilon_{\\min}$ is also positive. The intersection of the two intervals $(-\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_1)$ and $(-\\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_2)$ is $(-\\epsilon_{\\min}, \\epsilon_{\\min})$.\nTherefore, the intersection of the basis elements is $(-\\epsilon_{\\min}, \\epsilon_{\\min}) \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nThis resulting set is non-empty. For instance, the point $\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\min}}{2}$ is in this set. Since $U_{\\epsilon_1}(o_1) \\cap U_{\\epsilon_2}(o_2)$ is non-empty, and this intersection is a subset of $W_1 \\cap W_2$, it must be that $W_1 \\cap W_2$ is also non-empty.\n\nThis demonstrates that any open neighborhood $W_1$ of $o_1$ and any open neighborhood $W_2$ of $o_2$ have a non-empty intersection. Consequently, it is impossible to find disjoint open sets containing $o_1$ and $o_2$ respectively.\n\nTherefore, the space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ is not a Hausdorff space. This conclusion matches option B.\n\nLet's briefly consider the other options:\nA is incorrect because satisfying the Hausdorff condition for some pairs of points is not sufficient. It must hold for all pairs of distinct points. The pair $(o_1, o_2)$ is a counterexample.\nC is incorrect. The distinctness of two sets is not the same as them being disjoint. Disjoint means their intersection is empty, which is not the case here.\nD is incorrect. A point $x > 0$ can be separated from a point $y  0$. We can find small open intervals around each that do not contain 0 and are disjoint. For example, if $x=1$ and $y=-1$, the neighborhoods $(0.5, 1.5)$ and $(-1.5, -0.5)$ are disjoint open sets separating them.\nE is incorrect. The collection of sets does form a valid basis. The union of all basis sets covers $X$. The intersection of any two basis sets is either empty or is itself a union of basis sets (this can be verified, but is a standard result for this space).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1588967"}, {"introduction": "After seeing an example of a space that is not Hausdorff, let's turn our attention to one that is.
