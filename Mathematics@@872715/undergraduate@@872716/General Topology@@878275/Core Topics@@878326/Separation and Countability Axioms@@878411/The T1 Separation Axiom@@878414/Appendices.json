The basis elements are sets of the form $B_a = (-\\infty, a)$ for $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary singleton set $\\{x\\}$. For $\\{x\\}$ to be open, it must be a union of sets from the basis $\\mathcal{B}$. However, every basis element $(-\\infty, a)$ is an infinite set, containing uncountably many points. Any union of such sets will either be empty or will also be an infinite set (specifically, an interval of the form $(-\\infty, b)$ or $(-\\infty, b]$ for some $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$). A singleton set like $\\{x\\}$ contains only one point. Therefore, it is impossible to write $\\{x\\}$ as a union of basis elements.\n\nConclusion: No singleton set $\\{x\\}$ is an open set in this topology. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n**Part 2: Are singleton sets closed?**\n\nA set $F$ is defined to be closed if its complement, $X \\setminus F$, is an open set.\nLet's consider the singleton set $\\{x\\}$. Its complement is the set $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{x\\}$, which can be written as the union of two disjoint intervals: $(-\\infty, x) \\cup (x, \\infty)$.\n\nFor $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{x\\}$ to be an open set, it must satisfy the definition of an open set. A set $U$ is open if for every point $p \\in U$, there exists a basis element $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $p \\in B \\subseteq U$.\n\nLet's test this condition for the set $U = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\nConsider any point $p \\in U$. There are two cases:\nCase 1: $p  x$.\nIn this case, $p \\in (-\\infty, x)$. We can choose the basis element $B_x = (-\\infty, x)$. We have $p \\in B_x$ and $B_x \\subseteq U$ since every element of $B_x$ is less than $x$ and thus not equal to $x$. So, the condition holds for all points $p  x$.\n\nCase 2: $p > x$.\nLet's pick an arbitrary point $p$ such that $p > x$. For $U$ to be open, we must be able to find a basis element $B_a = (-\\infty, a)$ such that $p \\in B_a$ and $B_a \\subseteq U$.\nThe condition $p \\in B_a$ means that $p  a$.\nThe condition $B_a \\subseteq U$ means that $(-\\infty, a) \\subseteq (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{x\\})$. This requires that the point $x$ must not be in the interval $(-\\infty, a)$.\nSo we need to find an $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies two conditions simultaneously for our chosen $p$:\n1. $p  a$\n2. $x \\notin (-\\infty, a)$, which implies $x \\ge a$.\n\nCombining these, we would need $p  a \\le x$. However, we are in the case where we chose $p > x$. It is impossible for $p$ to be both less than $x$ (from $p  a \\le x$) and greater than $x$ at the same time. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, for any point $p > x$, there is no basis element $(-\\infty, a)$ that contains $p$ and is also a subset of $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{x\\}$. This means that the set $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is not open.\n\nSince the complement of $\\{x\\}$ is not open, the set $\\{x\\}$ is not closed. This is true for any choice of $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nConclusion: No singleton set $\\{x\\}$ is a closed set in this topology.
