The set of all such points $p$ is the set of limit points.\n\n**Part 1: Convergence in the Usual Topology $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_u)$**\n\nLet's find the set $L_u$. We test potential limit points $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nCase 1: $p = 0$.\nLet $U$ be any open neighborhood of $0$ in the usual topology. By the definition of the usual topology, there exists an open interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $0 \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\subseteq U$. By the Archimedean property of the real numbers, we can find a natural number $N$ such that $N > 1/\\epsilon$. This implies $1/N < \\epsilon$.\nNow, consider any natural number $n \\geq N$. We have $0 < 1/n \\leq 1/N < \\epsilon$. Therefore, $x_n = 1/n$ is in the interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$, and thus $x_n \\in U$.\nThis satisfies the definition of convergence. So, the net $(x_n)$ converges to $0$ in the usual topology. Thus, $0 \\in L_u$.\n\nCase 2: $p \\neq 0$.\nLet's show that the net does not converge to any $p \\neq 0$. Choose an $\\epsilon = |p|/2$. Since $p \\neq 0$, we have $\\epsilon > 0$. Consider the open interval $U = (p - \\epsilon, p + \\epsilon)$. This is an open neighborhood of $p$.\nWe need to check if the tail of the net is eventually in $U$. The net consists of points $x_n=1/n$ which get arbitrarily close to 0 for large $n$. For any $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we can always find an integer $n > N$ large enough such that $|x_n| = |1/n| < \\epsilon = |p|/2$. A point $y$ in $U$ must satisfy $|y-p| < \\epsilon$, which implies $|y| > |p| - \\epsilon = |p| - |p|/2 = |p|/2$. Since we can find an $n$ such that $|x_n| < |p|/2$, this $x_n$ cannot be in $U$.\nTherefore, it is not true that for every neighborhood $U$ of $p$, the net is eventually in $U$. The net does not converge to $p \\neq 0$.\n\nCombining these two cases, the set of all limit points in the usual topology is $L_u = \\{0\\}$.\n\n**Part 2: Convergence in the Cofinite Topology $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_{cf})$**\n\nNow let's find the set $L_{cf}$. We test an *arbitrary* potential limit point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet $p$ be any point in $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $p$ in the cofinite topology.\nBy the definition of the cofinite topology, since $p \\in U$, $U$ is not the empty set. Therefore, its complement, $C = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus U$, must be a finite set.\nThe net is the sequence of points $\\{1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots\\}$. This is an infinite set of distinct values.\nThe points of the net that are *not* in $U$ must be in its complement $C$. That is, the set $\\{x_n \\mid x_n \\notin U\\}$ is a subset of $C$.\nSince $C$ is a finite set, it can contain at most a finite number of elements from the infinite set $\\{x_n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. Let's call the set of indices of these points $I = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid x_n \\in C\\}$. The set $I$ must be finite.\nIf $I$ is empty, then all $x_n$ are in $U$, so we can choose $N=1$.\nIf $I$ is not empty, as a non-empty finite set of natural numbers, it must have a maximum element. Let $N_{max} = \\max(I)$.\nNow, let's choose $N = N_{max}$. For any natural number $n > N$, we have $n \\notin I$. This means $x_n \\notin C$, which by definition of $C$ implies $x_n \\in U$.\nSo, for any arbitrary $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and any of its open neighborhoods $U$, we found an $N$ ($=N_{max}$) such that for all $n > N$, $x_n \\in U$.\nThis is precisely the definition of convergence to $p$. Since $p$ was an arbitrary point in $\\mathbb{R}$, the net converges to every point in $\\mathbb{R}$.\nTherefore, the set of all limit points in the cofinite topology is $L_{cf} = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have found that $L_u = \\{0\\}$ and $L_{cf} = \\mathbb{R}$.
