We will first check if $\\mathcal{F}$ is a filter by verifying the three axioms, and then we will check if it is closed under countable intersections.\n\nFirst, let's verify the filter axioms for $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\n1.  **Does $\\mathcal{F}$ contain the empty set?**\n    A set $A$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$ if its complement $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A$ is finite. If we consider the empty set $A = \\emptyset$, its complement is $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\emptyset = \\mathbb{N}$. The set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ is infinite. Therefore, the complement of the empty set is not finite, which means $\\emptyset \\notin \\mathcal{F}$. The first axiom is satisfied. This also eliminates option E. We should also note that $\\mathcal{F}$ itself is not empty. For example, the set $A = \\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\{1\\}$ has a finite complement $\\{1\\}$, so $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n\n2.  **Is $\\mathcal{F}$ closed under finite intersections?**\n    Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets in $\\mathcal{F}$. By definition, their complements, $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A$ and $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus B$, are both finite. We need to check if the intersection $A \\cap B$ is also in $\\mathcal{F}$. This is equivalent to checking if the complement of the intersection, $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus (A \\cap B)$, is finite.\n    Using De Morgan's laws for sets, we have:\n    $$ \\mathbb{N} \\setminus (A \\cap B) = (\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A) \\cup (\\mathbb{N} \\setminus B) $$\n    Since $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A$ and $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus B$ are both finite sets, their union is also a finite set. Thus, $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus (A \\cap B)$ is finite, which implies that $A \\cap B \\in \\mathcal{F}$. The second axiom is satisfied. This eliminates option C.\n\n3.  **Is $\\mathcal{F}$ upwardly closed?**\n    Let $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and let $C$ be a set such that $A \\subseteq C \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$. We need to show that $C \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n    Since $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$, its complement $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A$ is finite.\n    The condition $A \\subseteq C$ implies that $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus C \\subseteq \\mathbb{N} \\setminus A$.\n    Since $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A$ is a finite set, any of its subsets must also be finite. Therefore, $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus C$ is finite.\n    By the definition of $\\mathcal{F}$, this means $C \\in \\mathcal{F}$. The third axiom is satisfied. This eliminates option D.\n\nSince all three filter axioms are satisfied, we conclude that $\\mathcal{F}$ is a filter on $\\mathbb{N}$. This type of filter is known as the Fréchet filter or the cofinite filter.\n\nNow, we must check if $\\mathcal{F}$ is closed under countable intersections. This property would mean that for any countable sequence of sets $\\{A_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\infty}$ where each $A_i \\in \\mathcal{F}$, their intersection $\\bigcap_{i=1}^{\\infty} A_i$ must also be in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nLet's test this with a specific counterexample. For each natural number $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$, define the set $A_i$ as:\n$$ A_i = \\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\{i\\} $$\nFor each $A_i$, its complement is $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A_i = \\mathbb{N} \\setminus (\\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\{i\\}) = \\{i\\}$. Since $\\{i\\}$ is a finite set (it contains only one element), each $A_i$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$. So, $\\{A_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\infty}$ is a countable sequence of sets in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nNow, let's compute their intersection:\n$$ A = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{\\infty} A_i = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{\\infty} (\\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\{i\\}) $$\nAn element $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is in the intersection $A$ if and only if $x \\in A_i$ for all $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This means $x \\neq i$ for all $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$. However, the set of all $i$ is $\\mathbb{N}$ itself. So, an element $x \\in A$ must not be any natural number. Since we are working within the universe of natural numbers $X=\\mathbb{N}$, there is no such element. Therefore, the intersection is the empty set:\n$$ A = \\emptyset $$\nWe need to check if this resulting intersection is in $\\mathcal{F}$. As we established in the first part of our analysis, $\\emptyset \\notin \\mathcal{F}$ because its complement $\\mathbb{N}$ is infinite.\n\nWe have found a countable collection of sets $\\{A_i\\}$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ whose intersection is not in $\\mathcal{F}$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{F}$ is not closed under countable intersections.\n\nCombining our findings, $\\mathcal{F}$ is a filter on $\\mathbb{N}$, but it is not closed under countable intersections.
