Since every nonempty open interval in $(0,1)$ contains infinitely many rationals, there are infinitely many $k$ with $q_{k}\\in(y_{1},y_{2})$, hence infinitely many $k$ with $s_{k}\\in U$.

Therefore no point $p \\in L$ (except possibly $(1/2, 1/2)$ if one of the $q_k$ happens to be $1/2$) can be a cluster point. The cluster set is not $L$.\n\nOption C: $s_{k}=(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{(-1)^{k}}{k+4},q_{k})$.\nFor any $p=(\\frac{1}{2},y)\\in L$ and any neighborhood $U=((\\frac{1}{2},y_{1}),(\\frac{1}{2},y_{2}))$ with $y_{1}yy_{2}$, we have $U\\subset\\{\\frac{1}{2}\\}\\times(y_1, y_2)$, but every $s_{k}$ has a first coordinate not equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$.

Thus $p$ is not a cluster point. On the other hand, if $x_{0}\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\cap(0,1)$, then any point $(x_0, y)$ on that vertical line is a cluster point because the enumeration $(r_k)$ contains infinitely many points with first coordinate $x_0$ and second coordinates dense in $(0,1)$.
