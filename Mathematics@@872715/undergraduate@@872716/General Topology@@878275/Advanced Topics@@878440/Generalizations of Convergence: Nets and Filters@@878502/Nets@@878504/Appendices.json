Also $x(n)<1$ since $x(n)\\leq L<1$. For positivity, note $3<4$ implies $\\sqrt{3}<2$, hence $L=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}>\\frac{1}{2}$, so for $n\\geq 1$ we have $10^{n}L\\geq 10^{n}/2\\geq 5$, and thus $\\lfloor 10^{n}L\\rfloor\\geq 5$, which yields $x(n)>0$. Therefore $x(n)\\in A$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}^{+}$.\n\nTo prove convergence, use the floor inequality: for any real $y$,\n$$\n\\lfloor y\\rfloor\\leq y<\\lfloor y\\rfloor+1.\n$$\nWith $y=10^{n}L$,\n$$\n\\frac{\\lfloor 10^{n}L\\rfloor}{10^{n}}\\leq L<\\frac{\\lfloor 10^{n}L\\rfloor+1}{10^{n}},\n$$\nso\n$$\n0\\leq L-x(n)<\\frac{1}{10^{n}}.\n$$\nHence $x(n)\\to L$. Therefore option C gives a net in $A$ converging to $L$. Option C is correct.\n\nCheck option D: The index set $D$ is all open intervals containing $L$ with order $\\subseteq$. This is a directed set because for any intervals $I,J$ containing $L$, there exists an open interval $K$ containing both $I$ and $J$ (for instance, the open interval whose endpoints are the minimum of the left endpoints of $I,J$ and the maximum of the right endpoints of $I,J$). The function $x:D\\to A$ is defined by choosing an arbitrary rational $x(I)\\in I\\cap A$ for each $I\\in D$.\n\nHowever, with order $\\subseteq$, the convergence condition requires: for every neighborhood $U$ of $L$, there exists $I_{0}\\in D$ such that for all $I\\in D$ with $I_{0}\\subseteq I$, we have $x(I)\\in U$. Fix any open neighborhood $U$ of $L$. For every $I\\supseteq U$, the set $I\\cap A$ contains points both inside and outside $U$. Since the definition forces $x(I)$ to be chosen “arbitrarily” from $I\\cap A$, one can make choices such that $x(I)\\notin U$ for all $I\\supseteq U$, contradicting the convergence requirement. In fact, unless the order is the reverse inclusion (so that “going forward” means taking smaller intervals), arbitrary choices will not ensure eventual membership in each fixed $U$.
