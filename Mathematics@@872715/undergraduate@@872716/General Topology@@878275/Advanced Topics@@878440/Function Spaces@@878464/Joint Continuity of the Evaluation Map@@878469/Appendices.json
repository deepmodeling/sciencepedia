Let $X$ have the indiscrete topology, so the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $X$. Let $f:X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be continuous. For any open $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, continuity requires $f^{-1}(U)$ to be open in $X$, hence $f^{-1}(U) \\in \\{\\emptyset, X\\}$.

Then $f^{-1}(U_1)$ contains $x_1$ but not $x_2$, so it is nonempty and not all of $X$, contradicting the requirement that $f^{-1}(U_1) \\in \\{\\emptyset, X\\}$. Hence every continuous $f$ must be constant. Conversely, if $f$ is constant with value $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then for any open $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, $f^{-1}(U)$ is $X$ if $c \\in U$ and $\\emptyset$ otherwise, so $f$ is continuous.
