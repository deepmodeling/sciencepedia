By the definition of the complement, this point is not in the graph $G$. This means that the second coordinate $y_0$ is not the image of the first coordinate $n_0$ under the function $f$. In other words, $y_0 \\neq f(n_0)$.\n\nNow we have two distinct points in the space $Y$: the point $y_0$ and the point $f(n_0)$. The problem states that $Y$ is a T1 space. By the definition of a T1 space, for any two distinct points, there exists an open set containing the first point but not the second. Applying this to our two points, there exists an open set $V \\subset Y$ such that $y_0 \\in V$ and $f(n_0) \\notin V$.\n\nNext, let's consider the space $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the discrete topology. In the discrete topology, every subset of $\\mathbb{Z}$ is an open set. In particular, the singleton set $\\{n_0\\}$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, we can construct an open set in the product space $\\mathbb{Z} \\times Y$. The product topology is generated by basis elements of the form $U_{Z} \\times U_{Y}$, where $U_{Z}$ is open in $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $U_{Y}$ is open in $Y$. Let's define the set $W = \\{n_0\\} \\times V$. Since $\\{n_0\\}$ is open in $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $V$ is open in $Y$, the set $W$ is an open set in the product space $\\mathbb{Z} \\times Y$.\n\nOur chosen point $(n_0, y_0)$ is in $W$, since $n_0 \\in \\{n_0\\}$ and $y_0 \\in V$.\n\nThe final step is to show that this entire open set $W$ is contained within the complement $G^c$. Let $(n, y)$ be any point in $W$. By the definition of $W$, we have $n = n_0$ and $y \\in V$. To check if $(n, y)$ is in the graph $G$, we would need $y = f(n)$. Since $n=n_0$, this condition becomes $y = f(n_0)$. However, we specifically chose the open set $V$ such that $f(n_0) \\notin V$. Since $y \\in V$, it must be that $y \\neq f(n_0)$. Therefore, the point $(n, y)$ cannot be in the graph $G$. This means $(n, y) \\in G^c$.\n\nSince $(n, y)$ was an arbitrary point in $W$, we have shown that $W \\subseteq G^c$.\n\nIn summary, for any arbitrary point $(n_0, y_0) \\in G^c$, we have found an open set $W$ in $\\mathbb{Z} \\times Y$ such that $(n_0, y_0) \\in W \\subseteq G^c$. This is the definition of an open set. Thus, $G^c$ is open. If the complement of a set is open, the set itself must be closed. Therefore, the graph $G$ is a closed subset of $\\mathbb{Z} \\times Y$.\n\nThis conclusion holds for any arbitrary function $f$ (no assumption of continuity was needed) and for any codomain $Y$ that is a T1 space. The specific properties of the discrete topology on $\\mathbb{Z}$ and the T1 separation axiom on $Y$ are sufficient.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. This is incorrect. Our proof only required the T1 property. While the assertion is also true for T2 spaces (since any T2 space is also T1), it is not *only* true for T2 spaces.\nB. This is incorrect. We did not use or require the assumption that $f$ is continuous. It is a known fact that any function from a discrete space to any topological space is continuous, but this fact is not necessary for the proof. The proof works for any function by its construction.\nC. This is incorrect. Consider $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with $f(n)=0$ for all $n$. The graph $G$ is the set of points $\\{(n, 0) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. This set is not open in $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{R}$. For instance, any open neighborhood of $(0,0)$ of the form $\\{0\\} \\times (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ contains points not in $G$, so $G$ does not contain a neighborhood of $(0,0)$.\nD. This is correct. Our proof demonstrates that the assertion holds for any function $f$ and any T1 space $Y$.\nE. This is incorrect, as our proof confirms the assertion is true.
