Characterizing Closed Sets**\nA set $F \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is closed if its complement, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus F$, is open. According to the definition of the cofinite topology, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus F$ is open if it is the empty set or it is a set whose complement is finite.\n- If $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus F = \\emptyset$, then $F = \\mathbb{R}$.

Understanding Closure and Density**\nThe closure of a set $A$, denoted $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$, is the smallest closed set that contains $A$. A set $A$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ if $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nUsing our characterization of closed sets, we can determine the closure for any subset $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$:\n- If $A$ is a finite set, then $A$ itself is a closed set. Since $A$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$, its closure is itself: $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) = A$. In this case, $A$ is not dense unless $A=\\mathbb{R}$, which is impossible for a finite set.\n- If $A$ is an infinite set, it cannot be contained in any finite closed set. The only other type of closed set is $\\mathbb{R}$ itself. Therefore, the smallest closed set containing an infinite set $A$ must be $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, for any infinite set $A$, $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis gives us a simple criterion: A subset $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is dense in the cofinite topology if and only if $A$ is an infinite set.\n\nNow we analyze each option based on this criterion.\n\n**A.

The open interval $(2, 3)$.**\nThe open interval $(2, 3) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid 2  x  3 \\}$ contains uncountably many real numbers. It is an infinite set. Therefore, its closure in the cofinite topology is $\\mathbb{R}$, and the set $(2, 3)$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**C. The set $\\{ \\sqrt{p} \\mid p \\text{ is a prime number} \\}$.**\nThe prime numbers are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...$. There are infinitely many prime numbers. For any two distinct primes $p_1$ and $p_2$, we have $\\sqrt{p_1} \\neq \\sqrt{p_2}$. Thus, the set $\\{ \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{5}, ... \\}$ is an infinite set.
