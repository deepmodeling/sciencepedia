The topological suspension of $S^1$, denoted $S(S^1)$, is an abstract space constructed from the cylinder $C = S^1 \\times [-1, 1]$ by applying an equivalence relation $\\sim$. This relation is defined as follows: for any two points $(p_1, t_1)$ and $(p_2, t_2)$ in the cylinder $C$:\n- $(p_1, 1) \\sim (p_2, 1)$ for any $p_1, p_2 \\in S^1$. This collapses the entire top edge of the cylinder to a single point, which we call the \"north pole\" $N$.\n- $(p_1, -1) \\sim (p_2, -1)$ for any $p_1, p_2 \\in S^1$. This collapses the entire bottom edge of the cylinder to a single point, which we call the \"south pole\" $S$.\n- For any $t \\in (-1, 1)$, a point $(p, t)$ is only equivalent to itself.\n\nThe suspension $S(S^1)$ is the set of all such equivalence classes, endowed with the quotient topology. We denote the equivalence class of a point $(\\theta, t) \\in C$ by $[(\\theta, t)]$.

In this problem, the space is the suspension $X = S(S^1)$. We are asked to find a path $\\gamma$ that satisfies two conditions:\n1. The starting point is $P = [(0, 0)]$, so we must have $\\gamma(0) = [(0, 0)]$.\n2. The ending point is the south pole $S$, so we must have $\\gamma(1) = S$.\n\nThe space $S(S^1)$ is a quotient space obtained from the cylinder $C = S^1 \\times [-1, 1]$ via the quotient map $q: C \\to S(S^1)$, where $q(\\theta, t) = [(\\theta, t)]$. A key property of quotient topologies is that a function $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to S(S^1)$ is continuous if and only if it can be \"lifted\" to a continuous path $\\tilde{\\gamma}: [0, 1] \\to C$ such that $\\gamma = q \\circ \\tilde{\\gamma}$.\nTherefore, our task is equivalent to finding a continuous path $\\tilde{\\gamma}(s) = (\\theta(s), t(s))$ in the cylinder $C$ for $s \\in [0, 1]$, which satisfies the boundary conditions after applying the quotient map $q$.\n\nLet's analyze the boundary conditions for the lifted path $\\tilde{\\gamma}(s)$:\n1. For the starting point, we need $q(\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)) = [(0, 0)]$.\nThe point $(\\theta, t) = (0, 0)$ is in the \"interior\" of the cylinder (since $t=0 \\in (-1,1)$), so its equivalence class $[(0, 0)]$ consists of only that single point. Thus, the lifted path must start at $\\tilde{\\gamma}(0) = (0, 0)$. This gives us the conditions for the component functions: $\\theta(0) = 0$ and $t(0) = 0$.\n\n2. For the ending point, we need $q(\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)) = S$.\nThe south pole $S$ is the equivalence class of all points on the bottom edge of the cylinder, i.e., $S = [(\\theta, -1)]$ for any $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. So, the lifted path must end at a point on this bottom edge. This means $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1) = (\\theta(1), -1)$ for some value of $\\theta(1)$. The condition on the height component is $t(1) = -1$. The angular component $\\theta(1)$ can be any value in $[0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nNow we need to construct continuous functions $\\theta(s)$ and $t(s)$ for $s \\in [0, 1]$ that satisfy these conditions:\n- $\\theta(0) = 0$\n- $t(0) = 0$\n- $t(1) = -1$\n\nLet's choose the simplest possible functions.\nFor the angular component $\\theta(s)$, we can simply keep the angle constant. A simple choice that satisfies $\\theta(0) = 0$ is $\\theta(s) = 0$ for all $s \\in [0, 1]$. This is a constant function, which is continuous.\n\nFor the height component $t(s)$, we need a continuous function that goes from $t(0) = 0$ to $t(1) = -1$. The simplest such function is a linear interpolation between the two points:\n$t(s) = (1-s) \\cdot t(0) + s \\cdot t(1) = (1-s) \\cdot 0 + s \\cdot (-1) = -s$.\nThis function is continuous for $s \\in [0, 1]$. The range of $t(s)$ is $[-1, 0]$, which is a subset of the allowed range $[-1, 1]$ for the cylinder's height coordinate.\n\nSo, we have found a continuous lifted path in the cylinder $C = S^1 \\times [-1, 1]$:\n$\\tilde{\\gamma}(s) = (\\theta(s), t(s)) = (0, -s)$ for $s \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nThe desired path $\\gamma(s)$ in the suspension $S(S^1)$ is the image of this path under the quotient map $q$:\n$\\gamma(s) = q(\\tilde{\\gamma}(s)) = q(0, -s) = [(0, -s)]$.\n\nLet's verify the endpoints:\n- $\\gamma(0) = [(0, -0)] = [(0, 0)] = P$.\n- $\\gamma(1) = [(0, -1)]$. Since all points with $t=-1$ are identified to form the south pole, $[(0, -1)] = S$.\n\nThe path is continuous because it is the composition of the continuous map $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ and the continuous quotient map $q$.

Yes, $S\\mathbb{R}$ is compact because any open cover has a finite subcover due to the poles 'capping' the space.", "solution": "The correct answer is that the suspension $S\\mathbb{R}$ is not compact. To determine this, we will analyze the relationship between the compactness of a space $X$ and its suspension $SX$. We will prove that $SX$ is compact if and only if $X$ is compact.\n\nFirst, let's assume $X$ is a compact space. The closed interval $[0, 1]$ is compact in the usual topology (by the Heine-Borel theorem). The product of two compact spaces is compact (a result known as Tychonoff's theorem). Therefore, the cylinder $X \\times [0, 1]$ is a compact space. The suspension $SX$ is obtained as a quotient space of $X \\times [0, 1]$. The quotient map $q: X \\times [0, 1] \\to SX$ is, by definition, continuous and surjective. A fundamental theorem in topology states that the continuous image of a compact space is compact. Since $X \\times [0, 1]$ is compact and $q$ is a continuous surjection, the image $SX$ must be compact.\n\nNext, let's assume the suspension $SX$ is a compact space. We want to show that this implies $X$ must also be compact. Consider the \"equator\" of the suspension, which is the set of points corresponding to the middle of the cylinder, $t=1/2$. Let's define a map $i: X \\to SX$ by $i(x) = [(x, 1/2)]$, where $[(x,t)]$ denotes the equivalence class of $(x,t)$ in $SX$. This map effectively embeds the space $X$ into its suspension.\nThe map $i$ is a homeomorphism onto its image, $i(X)$. To see this, note that $i$ is continuous because it is the composition of the continuous inclusion $x \\mapsto (x, 1/2)$ and the continuous quotient map $q$. The map is clearly injective. The inverse map from $i(X)$ to $X$ is also continuous, which can be shown by demonstrating that $i$ is a closed map onto its image.\n\nNow we show that the subspace $i(X)$ is a closed subset of $SX$. In the quotient topology, a set $F \\subset SX$ is closed if and only if its preimage $q^{-1}(F)$ is closed in the original space $X \\times [0, 1]$. The preimage of our subspace is $q^{-1}(i(X)) = X \\times \\{1/2\\}$. The set $X$ is closed in $X$, and $\\{1/2\\}$ is a closed subset of $[0, 1]$. Therefore, their product $X \\times \\{1/2\\}$ is a closed subset of the product space $X \\times [0, 1]$. This implies that its image under the quotient map, $i(X)$, is a closed subspace of $SX$.\n\nSo, we have established that $i(X)$ is a closed subspace of $SX$. If we assume $SX$ is compact, then any closed subspace of it must also be compact. Thus, $i(X)$ is compact. Since $X$ is homeomorphic to $i(X)$, $X$ must also be compact.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that $SX$ is compact if and only if $X$ is compact.\n\nNow we apply this result to the problem. We are given the space $X = \\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology. The real line $\\mathbb{R}$ is a classic example of a non-compact space. For instance, the collection of open intervals $\\{(-n, n) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is an open cover of $\\mathbb{R}$ that has no finite subcover. Since $\\mathbb{R}$ is not compact, our derived criterion immediately tells us that its suspension, $S\\mathbb{R}$, is not compact.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. This is incorrect. The premise that $\\mathbb{R} \\times [0, 1]$ is compact is false. The product of a non-compact space ($\\mathbb{R}$) and a compact space ($[0,1]$) is not compact.\nB. This is the correct reasoning. As shown in our proof, $S\\mathbb{R}$ contains the subspace $i(\\mathbb{R}) = \\{[(x, 1/2)] \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$, which is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. This subspace is a closed subset of $S\\mathbb{R}$. If $S\\mathbb{R}$ were compact, all of its closed subspaces would have to be compact. Since $i(\\mathbb{R})$ is homeomorphic to the non-compact space $\\mathbb{R}$, it is not compact. Therefore, $S\\mathbb{R}$ cannot be compact.\nC. This is incorrect. The suspension of the circle $S^1$ is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere $S^2$. The suspension of the real line, $S\\mathbb{R}$, is a different topological space. It can be visualized as two cones joined at their bases, where the circular base extends infinitely in diameter. $S^2$ is compact, whereas $S\\mathbb{R}$ is not.\nD. This statement is a false generalization. The quotient of a non-compact space can be compact. For example, the map $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1$ given by $f(x) = (\\cos(2\\pi x), \\sin(2\\pi x))$ maps the non-compact real line onto the compact circle.\nE. This relies on an imprecise geometric intuition that is not topologically sound.

It is convenient to identify the equator $X_0$ with the space $X$ itself via the homeomorphism $q|_{X \\times \\{1/2\\}}$. Thus, a retraction would be a continuous map $r: SX \\to X$ such that for any $x \\in X$, $r(q(x, 1/2)) = x$. An element of $SX$ is an equivalence class, which we denote as $[(x, t)]$.\n\n**Part 1: If $X$ is contractible, then $X_0$ is a retract of $SX$.**\n\nAssume $X$ is a contractible space. This means there exists a continuous map (a homotopy) $H: X \\times [0, 1] \\to X$ such that for some point $x_c \\in X$, we have $H(x, 0) = x$ and $H(x, 1) = x_c$ for all $x \\in X$.\n\nWe will construct a retraction $r: SX \\to X_0$. To do this, we first define a map $R: X \\times [0, 1] \\to X_0$ and show that it is continuous and respects the equivalence relation of the suspension, thus inducing a continuous map $r$ on the quotient space $SX$. We identify $X_0$ with $X$ for notational simplicity, so we define $R: X \\times [0, 1] \\to X$.\n\nLet's define $R$ piecewise on the two \"halves\" of the cylinder $X \\times [0, 1]$:\n$$\nR(x, t) = \\begin{cases}\nH(x, 1-2t)  \\text{if } 0 \\le t \\le 1/2 \\\\\nH(x, 2t-1)  \\text{if } 1/2 \\le t \\le 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis map is continuous on the domain $X \\times [0, 1]$ by the pasting lemma. At $t=1/2$, both definitions agree: $R(x, 1/2) = H(x, 0) = x$. The function is built from continuous functions $H, (x,t) \\mapsto 1-2t,$ and $(x,t) \\mapsto 2t-1$, so it is continuous on each closed piece.\n\nNow we must check if $R$ respects the equivalence relation $\\sim$ of the suspension.\nFor the bottom slice ($t=0$):\n$R(x, 0) = H(x, 1) = x_c$. This value is constant for all $x \\in X$. Thus, if $(x, 0) \\sim (y, 0)$, then $R(x, 0) = x_c = R(y, 0)$. The condition is satisfied.\n\nFor the top slice ($t=1$):\n$R(x, 1) = H(x, 1) = x_c$. This value is also constant for all $x \\in X$. Thus, if $(x, 1) \\sim (y, 1)$, then $R(x, 1) = x_c = R(y, 1)$. This condition is also satisfied.\n\nSince $R$ is continuous and constant on the sets identified to single points in the quotient, it induces a continuous map $r: SX \\to X$.\n\nFinally, we must check if $r$ is a retraction. A point on the equator $X_0$ is of the form $[(x, 1/2)]$ for some $x \\in X$. We need $r([(x, 1/2)]) = [(x, 1/2)]$ (when identifying $X_0$ with $X$, this means $r([(x, 1/2)]) = x$).\nUsing our definition of $R$, we have:\n$r([(x, 1/2)]) = R(x, 1/2) = H(x, 0) = x$.\nThis is precisely the condition for a retraction. Therefore, if $X$ is contractible, $X_0$ is a retract of $SX$.\n\n**Part 2: If $X_0$ is a retract of $SX$, then $X$ is contractible.**\n\nAssume there exists a retraction $r: SX \\to X_0$. Again, we identify $X_0$ with $X$. The retraction is a continuous map $r: SX \\to X$ such that $r([(x, 1/2)]) = x$ for all $x \\in X$. We want to show that $X$ is contractible. We need to construct a homotopy $H: X \\times [0, 1] \\to X$ from the identity map on $X$ to a constant map.\n\nConsider the \"upper cone\" of the suspension, which is the image of $X \\times [1/2, 1]$ under the quotient map. For any point $x \\in X$, there is a canonical path within this upper cone starting at $[(x, 1/2)]$ on the equator and ending at the north pole $N = [(y, 1)]$ for any $y$. Let's define this path by $\\gamma_x: [0, 1] \\to SX$ where $\\gamma_x(s) = [(x, (1+s)/2)]$. The parameter $t = (1+s)/2$ ranges from $1/2$ to $1$ as $s$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.\n\nNow, let's define our homotopy $H$ using the retraction $r$ and these paths:\n$$H(x, s) = r(\\gamma_x(s)) = r([(x, (1+s)/2)])$$\nSince $r$ and the map $(x, s) \\mapsto [(x, (1+s)/2)]$ are continuous, $H$ is a continuous map from $X \\times [0, 1]$ to $X$.\n\nLet's check the properties of $H$.\nAt $s=0$:\n$H(x, 0) = r([(x, 1/2)])$. Since $r$ is a retraction, this is equal to $x$. So, $H(\\cdot, 0) = \\text{id}_X$.\n\nAt $s=1$:\n$H(x, 1) = r([(x, 1)])$. The point $[(x, 1)]$ is the north pole $N$ of the suspension. The position of this point in $SX$ does not depend on $x$. So, $r([(x, 1)])$ is some fixed point in $X$, let's call it $x_c = r(N)$. Thus, $H(x, 1) = x_c$ for all $x \\in X$. This is a constant map.\n\nThe map $H$ is a continuous deformation from the identity map on $X$ to a constant map. This is the definition of $X$ being contractible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have shown that $X_0$ is a retract of $SX$ if and only if $X$ is contractible. This makes option B the correct statement.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\nA. False. Counterexample: let $X = S^1$, the circle. $X$ is not contractible.
