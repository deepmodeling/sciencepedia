Its basis consists of all rectangles of the form $[a, b) \\times [c, d)$.", "solution": "We analyze each option against the three requirements: separable, countable cellularity, and uncountable weight.\n\nFor A (the real line with the Euclidean topology): It is separable because $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense. Its cellularity is countable: any family of pairwise disjoint nonempty open intervals $\\{(a_{i},b_{i})\\}$ is countable since we can inject it into $\\mathbb{Q}$ by choosing a distinct rational in each interval. Its weight is countable because the family $\\{(a,b): a,b\\in \\mathbb{Q}, ab\\}$ is a countable base, so $w(\\mathbb{R}) \\le \\aleph_{0}$. Therefore A fails the “uncountable weight” requirement.\n\nFor B (the Sorgenfrey line $\\mathbb{R}_{S}$):\n- Separability: $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}_{S}$, since every nonempty basic open set $[a,b)$ contains a rational number. Hence $\\mathbb{R}_{S}$ is separable.\n- Countable cellularity: Let $\\mathcal{U}$ be a family of pairwise disjoint nonempty open sets in $\\mathbb{R}_{S}$. For each $U \\in \\mathcal{U}$, we can choose a basic open set $[a_U, b_U) \\subseteq U$. The corresponding open intervals $(a_U, b_U)$ must be pairwise disjoint. By picking a distinct rational number from each of these disjoint intervals, we can establish a one-to-one correspondence with a subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$, proving that $\\mathcal{U}$ must be countable. Thus, $|\\mathcal{U}|\\le \\aleph_{0}$. Since there is an infinite pairwise disjoint family (e.g., $\\{[n,n+1):n\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$), we get $c(\\mathbb{R}_{S})=\\aleph_{0}$.\n- Uncountable weight: Suppose $\\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\\mathbb{R}_{S}$. For each $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$, the set $[x,x+1)$ is open. Since $\\mathcal{B}$ is a basis, there must exist some $B_{x}\\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $x\\in B_{x}\\subseteq [x,x+1)$. For any basis element, which is of the form $[a,b)$, if $x \\in [a,b)$, then $a \\le x$. If also $[a,b) \\subseteq [x, x+1)$, then we must have $a \\ge x$. Thus, $a=x$. This means that for each $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there is a basis element $B_x$ that starts at $x$. If $x \\neq y$, then $B_x \\neq B_y$ because their left endpoints differ. This creates an injective map from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$, so $|\\mathcal{B}|\\ge |\\mathbb{R}|=2^{\\aleph_{0}}$. Hence $w(\\mathbb{R}_{S})\\ge 2^{\\aleph_{0}}$, which is uncountable. Thus B satisfies all three properties.\n\nFor C (an uncountable discrete space): It is not separable because any dense subset must equal the whole space, which is uncountable. Its cellularity is uncountable since the family of all singletons is a pairwise disjoint family of nonempty open sets of cardinality $|X|$. Hence C fails the first two requirements.\n\nFor D (the Sorgenfrey plane $\\mathbb{R}_{S}\\times \\mathbb{R}_{S}$): It is a standard fact that the Sorgenfrey plane is not separable (it is a classical counterexample showing that a product of separable spaces need not be separable). Therefore D fails the separability requirement.\n\nConclusion: Only B is separable, has countable cellularity, and has uncountable weight.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1533529"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice introduces the 'character' of a point, a local cardinal invariant, and investigates a crucial topological principle: properties can change dramatically when moving from an ambient space to a subspace.
