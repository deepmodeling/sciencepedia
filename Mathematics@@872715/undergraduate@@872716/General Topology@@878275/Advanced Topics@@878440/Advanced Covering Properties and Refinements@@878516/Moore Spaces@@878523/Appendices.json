We will analyze the properties of this space step-by-step to select the correct option among the choices.\n\nFirst, let's briefly verify that $\\mathcal{B}$ is indeed a basis for a topology.\n1. For any integer $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, there is a basis element containing it. If $x$ is odd, $\\{x\\} \\in \\mathcal{B}$ contains $x$. If $x$ is even, $\\{x-1, x, x+1\\} \\in \\mathcal{B}$ contains $x$. So $\\mathcal{B}$ covers $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n2. Let $B_1, B_2 \\in \\mathcal{B}$ and let $x \\in B_1 \\cap B_2$. We must find a $B_3 \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $x \\in B_3 \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$.\n   - If $x$ is odd, we can always choose $B_3 = \\{x\\}$. Since $\\{x\\}$ is a basis element itself and is the smallest possible non-empty set containing $x$, the condition $x \\in \\{x\\} \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$ is satisfied.\n   - If $x$ is even, then any basis element containing $x$ must be of the form $\\{x-1, x, x+1\\}$. If $x \\in B_1 \\cap B_2$ and $x$ is even, then it must be that $B_1$ and $B_2$ are both centered at $x$, meaning $B_1 = B_2 = \\{x-1, x, x+1\\}$. We can choose $B_3 = B_1$, and the condition $x \\in B_3 \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$ holds.\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{B}$ is a valid basis for a topology $\\tau$ on $\\mathbb{Z}$. This means option B is incorrect.\n\nNext, we check if $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is a $T_1$ space. According to the definition, for any two distinct points $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, there must be a neighborhood of $x$ not containing $y$ AND a neighborhood of $y$ not containing $x$.\n\nLet's test this with a specific pair of points. Consider the points $x=2$ (even) and $y=1$ (odd).\n- We need a neighborhood of $x=2$ that does not contain $y=1$. An open set containing 2 must contain a basis element that contains 2. The only basis element in $\\mathcal{B}$ containing 2 is $B_2 = \\{2-1, 2, 2+1\\} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Any open set $U$ containing 2 must therefore contain $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Consequently, any neighborhood of $x=2$ must also contain the point $y=1$.\n- Thus, it is not possible to find an open set containing 2 but not 1.\n\nSince we have found a pair of distinct points $(2, 1)$ for which the $T_1$ condition fails, the space $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is not a $T_1$ space.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the equivalent condition for a $T_1$ space: all singleton sets must be closed. Let's check if the set $\\{1\\}$ is closed.\nA set is closed if its complement is open. The complement of $\\{1\\}$ is $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{1\\}$. For this set to be open, for every point $p \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{1\\}$, there must be a basis element $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $p \\in B \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{1\\}$.\nConsider the point $p=2$, which is in $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{1\\}$. The only basis element containing $p=2$ is $B = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. However, this basis element $B$ is not a subset of $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{1\\}$, because $1 \\in B$. Since there is no other basis element containing 2, we cannot find the required basis neighborhood for the point 2. Thus, $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{1\\}$ is not an open set, which means $\\{1\\}$ is not a closed set. As not all singletons are closed, the space is not $T_1$.\n\nThe problem states that a space is regular only if it is a $T_1$ space. Since $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is not $T_1$, it cannot be regular.\nThe problem also states that a Moore space must be regular. Since $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is not regular, it cannot be a Moore space.\n\nNow we can evaluate the options:\n- A. Yes, $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is a Moore space. This is false, as it fails the $T_1$ condition required for regularity.\n- B. No, because the collection $\\mathcal{B}$ does not form a valid basis. This is false, as we showed it is a basis.\n- C. No, because the space $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is not a $T_1$ space. This is true, as demonstrated. This is the fundamental reason the space fails to be a Moore space.\n- D. No, because the space $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is a $T_1$ space, but it is not regular. This is false because the premise \"is a $T_1$ space\" is incorrect.\n- E. No, because the space $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is a regular space, but it does not have a development. This is false because the premise \"is a regular space\" is incorrect.\n\nThe most accurate reason for the space not being a Moore space is that it fails the $T_1$ separation axiom.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1563258"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the definition and its prerequisites, we now apply these ideas to a more familiar and significant context.
