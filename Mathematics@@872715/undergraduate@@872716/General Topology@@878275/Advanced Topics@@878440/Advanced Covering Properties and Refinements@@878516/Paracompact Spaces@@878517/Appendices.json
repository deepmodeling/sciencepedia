Together with $U_{\\infty}$, we obtain a finite subcover of $\\mathcal{U}$. Therefore $S^{*}$ is compact.\n\nCompactness implies paracompactness: given any open cover, a finite subcover is a locally finite open refinement (a subcover is a refinement, and any finite family is locally finite). Thus $S^{*}$ is paracompact.\n\nWe now evaluate the options.\n\nA. False. Non-metrizability does not preclude paracompactness. In fact, $S^{*}$ is paracompact by compactness.

As written, this is not a correct justification. While $S^{*}$ is indeed paracompact, this does not follow from paracompactness of $S$ being “preserved” by one-point compactification; rather, it follows because $S^{*}$ is compact, and compact spaces are paracompact. The stated reason is not the right principle, so the option is not correct as a statement with its given justification.\n\nD. True. $S$ is discrete and locally compact Hausdorff, so $S^{*}$ is compact Hausdorff. All compact spaces are paracompact, hence $S^{*}$ is paracompact. The justification given is correct.\n\nE.
