To verify the basis property, let $V \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}$ be open and $x \\in V$. Then $V = U \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ for some open $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. Since $U$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists an open interval $(a,b) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ with $x \\in (a,b) \\subseteq U$. Using the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, choose $p,q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $a  p  x  q  b$.

Indeed, if an open set in $\\mathbb{Q}$ contains $q$, it must contain a set of the form $(a,b) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ with $a  q  b$, which necessarily contains infinitely many rationals distinct from $q$. Therefore, no $\\{q\\}$ is open in $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $\\mathcal{B}_{C}$ cannot be a basis for the given topology.\n\nFor option D:\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}_{D} = \\{ (-\\infty, q) \\cap \\mathbb{Q} \\mid q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\} \\cup \\{ (p, +\\infty) \\cap \\mathbb{Q} \\mid p \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\}.\n$$\nAlthough these sets form a standard subbasis for the order topology on $\\mathbb{R}$ (and hence their finite intersections generate intervals), as a basis collection by themselves they do not satisfy the basis condition in $\\mathbb{Q}$.

If $B \\in \\mathcal{B}_{D}$ contains $x$, then $B$ is either $(-\\infty, q) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ or $(p, +\\infty) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$. In the first case, $B$ contains rationals less than $r$, hence $B \\nsubseteq V$. In the second case, $B$ contains rationals greater than $s$, hence $B \\nsubseteq V$.

Let $\\alpha,\\beta\\in X$ with $\\alpha\\neq\\beta$. Without loss of generality assume $\\alpha\\beta$. There are two cases.\n- If there exists $\\gamma$ with $\\alpha\\gamma\\beta$ (e.g., take $\\gamma=\\alpha+1$ if $\\alpha+1\\beta$), then the sets $U=[0,\\gamma)$ and $V=(\\gamma,\\omega_{1})$ are open in the order topology, disjoint, and satisfy $\\alpha\\in U$ and $\\beta\\in V$.\n- If $\\beta=\\alpha+1$, then $U=[0,\\beta)$ and $V=(\\alpha,\\omega_{1})$ are open, disjoint, and satisfy $\\alpha\\in U$ and $\\beta\\in V$.\nThus $X$ is Hausdorff.\n\nStep 2: $X$ is regular. This is a standard fact for linearly ordered topological spaces (LOTS): every LOTS with the order topology is regular. Concretely, given a point $p$ and an open set $O$ with $p\\in O$, there exists a basic open interval $I$ (of the form $(a,b)$ or $[0,b)$) with $p\\in I\\subseteq O$. One can then refine $I$ to a smaller basic open set $J$ whose closure is contained in $I$ (and hence in $O$) by adjusting endpoints using immediate successors or predecessors when they exist, or by choosing endpoints strictly between $p$ and the endpoints of $I$ when possible; this standard shrinking argument in LOTS establishes regularity.

Specifically, for Hausdorffness: given $f \\neq g$, let $\\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{2} d(f,g)  0$; then the open balls $B(f,\\varepsilon)$ and $B(g,\\varepsilon)$ are disjoint. For regularity: let $F$ be closed and $f \\notin F$; then $\\delta = \\inf\\{d(f,h) : h \\in F\\}  0$ and the balls $B(f,\\delta/2)$ and $\\bigcup_{h \\in F} B(h,\\delta/2)$ are disjoint open sets separating $f$ and $F$. Hence options B and C are false.\n\nThe Urysohn Metrization Theorem provides a sufficient condition: regular, Hausdorff, second-countable implies metrizable. It is not merely necessary. Thus option A is false.\n\nThe key obstruction is second-countability. We show $(B(\\mathbb{R}), d)$ is not second-countable by proving it is not separable, and using the fact that second-countable implies separable for any topological space.\n\nTo show non-separability, construct an uncountable family of pairwise disjoint open balls of fixed radius. For each subset $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, define $f_{A} : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $f_{A}(x) = 1$ if $x \\in A$ and $f_{A}(x) = 0$ otherwise.

Thus\n$$\nd(f_{A}, f_{B}) = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |f_{A}(x) - f_{B}(x)| = 1.\n$$\nTherefore, the open balls $B(f_{A}, \\tfrac{1}{2})$ and $B(f_{B}, \\tfrac{1}{2})$ are disjoint whenever $A \\neq B$. Since there are $2^{2^{\\aleph_{0}}}$ distinct subsets $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, we obtain uncountably many pairwise disjoint open balls of radius $\\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n\nIn a separable metric space, for any fixed radius $r  0$, there can be at most countably many pairwise disjoint open balls of radius $r$: if $D$ is a countable dense subset, then each such ball contains at least one point of $D$, and disjointness of the balls forces a distinct point of $D$ in each ball. Hence the existence of uncountably many pairwise disjoint balls contradicts separability. Thus $(B(\\mathbb{R}), d)$ is not separable.\n\nSince second-countable implies separable in any topological space, $(B(\\mathbb{R}), d)$ cannot be second-countable.
