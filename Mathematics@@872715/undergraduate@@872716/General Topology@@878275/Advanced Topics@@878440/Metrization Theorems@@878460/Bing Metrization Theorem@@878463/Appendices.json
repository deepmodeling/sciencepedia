The distance between centers of distinct balls, e.g., $B((n,0),1/4)$ and $B((k,0),1/4)$ with $n \\neq k$, is at least $1$. The sum of their radii is $1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$. Since the distance between centers is greater than the sum of radii, the balls are disjoint. In fact, they are separated by a minimum distance of $1 - 1/2 = 1/2$. For any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we can take a neighborhood $V=B(p, 1/4)$, which can intersect at most one of these balls. Thus, $\\mathcal{F}_{A}$ is a discrete family.\n\nOption B: $\\mathcal{F}_{B}=\\{B((m,n),3/4)\\mid m,n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\nFirst, we show it is locally finite. Fix any point $p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Let's consider the neighborhood $U = B(p, 1)$. If $U$ intersects a ball $B((m,n), 3/4)$, then the distance between their centers must be less than the sum of their radii: $d(p, (m,n))  1 + 3/4 = 7/4$. The set of integer lattice points $(m,n)$ inside the ball $B(p, 7/4)$ is finite. Thus, any neighborhood of radius 1 around any point $p$ intersects only a finite number of sets from $\\mathcal{F}_B$. So, the family is locally finite.\nNext, we show it is not discrete. Consider the point $p=(1/2,1/2)$.

Consequently, any neighborhood of $p$ must intersect at least these four sets. Therefore, $\\mathcal{F}_{B}$ is not a discrete family. This option is locally finite but not discrete.\n\nOption C: $\\mathcal{F}_{C}=\\{B((1/n,1/n),1/n)\\mid n\\in\\mathbb{Z}, n\\geq 2\\}$. Consider the point $p=(0,0)$. Any neighborhood $U=B(p,r)$ with $r>0$ contains points arbitrarily close to $(0,0)$. For any $n$ large enough such that $\\sqrt{(1/n)^2+(1/n)^2} = \\sqrt{2}/n  r$, the center $(1/n, 1/n)$ is in $U$. The ball $B((1/n,1/n),1/n)$ contains the origin in its closure for all $n$. For any $r>0$, we can find $N$ such that for all $n>N$, the ball $B((1/n,1/n),1/n)$ intersects $B(p,r)$. Since there are infinitely many such $n$, any neighborhood of the origin intersects infinitely many sets from $\\mathcal{F}_C$. Therefore, the family is not locally finite.\n\nOption D: $\\mathcal{F}_{D}=\\{(n-1/3,n+1/3)\\times\\mathbb{R}\\mid n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$. This is a family of disjoint open vertical strips. The gap between strip $(n-1/3,n+1/3)\\times\\mathbb{R}$ and $(n+1-1/3, n+1+1/3)\\times\\mathbb{R}$ is the region $(n+1/3, n+2/3)\\times\\mathbb{R}$. For any point $p=(x,y)$, we can choose a neighborhood $V=B(p,r)$ with $r1/6$. This ball can intersect at most one of the strips.
