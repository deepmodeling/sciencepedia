Both $\\mathbb{R}$ with the Euclidean topology and $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the discrete topology satisfy the hypotheses, so $\\mathbb{R}^{*}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}^{*}$ are compact Hausdorff.\n\nFirst, compare connectedness. The space $\\mathbb{R}$ is connected. If $\\mathbb{R}^{*}$ were disconnected, write $\\mathbb{R}^{*} = U \\cup V$ with $U,V$ disjoint nonempty open. Without loss of generality, $\\infty \\in U$, so $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}$.

This contradicts the connectedness of $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore $\\mathbb{R}^{*}$ is connected. In contrast, in $\\mathbb{Z}^{*}$ every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is isolated since $\\{n\\}$ is open (it is open in $\\mathbb{Z}$ and remains open in $\\mathbb{Z}^{*}$). Moreover, $\\{n\\}$ is closed: its complement is open because for each $m \\neq n$ the open set $\\{m\\}$ is contained in the complement, and at $\\infty$ we have the neighborhood $\\{\\infty\\} \\cup (\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{n\\})$ contained in the complement. Hence $\\{n\\}$ is clopen and nontrivial, so $\\mathbb{Z}^{*}$ is disconnected. Therefore, $\\mathbb{R}^{*}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}^{*}$ are not homeomorphic due to different connectedness. This validates option B and falsifies option A.\n\nSecond, compare second-countability. For $\\mathbb{R}^{*}$, a countable base is obtained by taking a countable base of $\\mathbb{R}$ (for example, open intervals with rational endpoints) together with a countable local base at $\\infty$, for instance $U_{m} = \\{\\infty\\} \\cup \\left(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus [-m,m]\\right)$ for $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Any neighborhood of $\\infty$ is of the form $\\{\\infty\\} \\cup (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus K)$ with $K$ compact, hence bounded, so $K \\subset [-m,m]$ for some $m$, which gives $U_{m} \\subset \\{\\infty\\} \\cup (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus K)$. Thus $\\mathbb{R}^{*}$ is second-countable. For $\\mathbb{Z}^{*}$, take the base consisting of all singletons $\\{n\\}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and the sets $V_{m} = \\{\\infty\\} \\cup \\{k \\in \\mathbb{Z} : |k| > m\\}$ for $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Any neighborhood of $\\infty$ is $\\{\\infty\\} \\cup (\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus K)$ with $K$ finite, so choosing $m$ larger than all $|k|$ for $k \\in K$ yields $V_{m} \\subset \\{\\infty\\} \\cup (\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus K)$. Hence $\\mathbb{Z}^{*}$ is also second-countable. Therefore, second-countability does not distinguish them, so option C is false.\n\nThird, compare isolated points. In $\\mathbb{Z}^{*}$, every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is isolated as noted above. The point $\\infty$ is not isolated since $\\{\\infty\\}$ is not open (it would require $\\mathbb{Z}$ to be compact to write $\\{\\infty\\} = \\{\\infty\\} \\cup (\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus K)$ with $K = \\mathbb{Z}$). In $\\mathbb{R}^{*}$, no point is isolated: if $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then any neighborhood of $x$ contains an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ and thus other points of $\\mathbb{R}$; if $x = \\infty$, then any neighborhood $\\{\\infty\\} \\cup (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus K)$ contains infinitely many points of $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, the presence of isolated points in $\\mathbb{Z}^{*}$ but not in $\\mathbb{R}^{*}$ distinguishes them; option D is correct.\n\nFinally, both spaces are Hausdorff by the general property that the one-point compactification of a locally compact Hausdorff space is Hausdorff, so option E is false.\n\nConsequently, the correct statements are B and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "1585131"}]}
