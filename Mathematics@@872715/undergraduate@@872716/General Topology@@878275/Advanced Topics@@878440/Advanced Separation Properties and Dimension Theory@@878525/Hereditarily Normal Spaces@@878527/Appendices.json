A topological space is called **normal** if for any pair of disjoint closed sets $C_1$ and $C_2$, there exist disjoint open sets $U_1$ and $U_2$ such that $C_1 \\subseteq U_1$ and $C_2 \\subseteq U_2$.\n2.

By definition, closed sets are complements of open sets in $X$. Since the complements in $X$ of the listed open sets are $X$, $\\{b,c\\}$, $\\{a\\}$, and $\\emptyset$, respectively, the family of closed sets is exactly $\\{\\emptyset,\\{a\\},\\{b,c\\},X\\}$.\n\nTo check normality of $(X,\\tau)$, we must verify that for any disjoint closed sets $C_{1},C_{2}$ there exist disjoint open sets $U_{1},U_{2}$ with $C_{1}\\subseteq U_{1}$ and $C_{2}\\subseteq U_{2}$. The only nontrivial pair of disjoint closed sets is $C_{1}=\\{a\\}$ and $C_{2}=\\{b,c\\}$. Choosing $U_{1}=\\{a\\}$ and $U_{2}=\\{b,c\\}$, which are open and disjoint, satisfies the requirement.

If $Y=\\emptyset$ or $|Y|=1$, then the only closed subsets are $\\emptyset$ and $Y$; any two disjoint closed sets are either both empty or one is empty, and the separation by open sets is immediate, so such $Y$ are normal.\n\n2.

Any pair of disjoint closed sets in $Y$ must involve $\\emptyset$, and choosing $U_{1}=Y$ and $U_{2}=\\emptyset$ (or vice versa) provides disjoint open neighborhoods, so $Y$ is normal.\n\n3.

In a discrete space every subset is open (and closed), so given disjoint closed sets $C_{1},C_{2}\\subseteq Y$ one may take $U_{1}=C_{1}$ and $U_{2}=C_{2}$, which are open and disjoint, proving normality.\n\nThus every subspace of $(X,\\tau)$ is normal, so the space is hereditarily normal.

Every metric space is completely regular and Hausdorff, hence Tychonoff. Moreover, every subspace of a metric space is metrizable, and every metric space is normal. Therefore $\\mathbb{R}$ is hereditarily normal. So A does not provide the requested example.\n\n- Option B: The Sorgenfrey line $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ (lower limit topology) is Tychonoff. One way to see this is that $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is a generalized ordered space (a GO-space), and GO-spaces are completely regular and Hausdorff, hence Tychonoff. Furthermore, GO-spaces are monotonically normal, and monotone normality is hereditary; in particular, GO-spaces are hereditarily normal. Hence $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is hereditarily normal, so B does not provide the requested example.\n\n- Option C: The Sorgenfrey plane $\\mathbb{R}_{l}\\times \\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is a product of two Tychonoff spaces, so by the product theorem it is Tychonoff. However, it is a classical result that the Sorgenfrey plane is not normal (for instance, there exist disjoint closed sets that cannot be separated by disjoint open sets; this is the standard counterexample showing that the product of perfectly normal spaces need not be normal). Since it is not even normal, it is certainly not hereditarily normal. Therefore C is an example of a Tychonoff space that is not hereditarily normal.\n\n- Option D: Any well-ordered set with the order topology is a linearly ordered topological space (LOTS).
