Define the linear functional $h(x,y,z)=2x-y+3z$. Then $S_{A}=h^{-1}(\\{\\sqrt{2}\\})$. The map $h$ is continuous and open (nontrivial linear surjection), and $\\{\\sqrt{2}\\}$ is closed and has empty interior in $\\mathbb{R}$. Hence $S_{A}$ is closed. To see $S_{A}$ has empty interior, suppose for contradiction there exists a nonempty open ball $B\\subset S_{A}$.
