This problem explores these concepts within the familiar context of the rational numbers.\n\nConsider the set of all rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, equipped with the standard metric inherited from the real numbers, $d(x, y) = |x - y|$. Let us define the following terms for a general metric space $(X, d)$:\n\n- A set $A \\subseteq X$ is called **nowhere dense** in $X$ if the interior of its closure is the empty set.\n- A set $S \\subseteq X$ is called **meager** (or of the first category) in $X$ if it can be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets.\n- A topological space $X$ is called a **Baire space** if it is not meager in itself. That is, $X$ cannot be expressed as a countable union of nowhere dense sets.\n\nBased on these definitions, determine whether the metric space $(\\mathbb{Q}, d)$ is a Baire space and select the option that provides the correct conclusion and justification.\n\nA. No, because $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable and can be expressed as a countable union of its singleton points, each of which is a nowhere dense set in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nB. Yes, because the Baire Category Theorem states that any complete metric space is a Baire space, and $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a complete metric space.\n\nC. Yes, because $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a dense subset of the Baire space $\\mathbb{R}$, and any dense subset of a Baire space is also a Baire space.\n\nD. No, because every proper non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is nowhere dense.\n\nE. Yes, because no non-empty open set in $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be meager, which is the definition of a Baire space.", "solution": "To determine if the metric space $(\\mathbb{Q}, d)$ is a Baire space, we must check if it is meager in itself, according to the provided definition. A space is meager in itself if it can be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets.\n\nStep 1: Express $\\mathbb{Q}$ as a countable union of sets.\nThe set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is known to be a countable set. This means we can enumerate all of its elements in a sequence, say $q_1, q_2, q_3, \\dots$. Therefore, we can express the entire set $\\mathbb{Q}$ as the union of all its individual points (singleton sets):\n$$ \\mathbb{Q} = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\{q_n\\} $$\nThis is a countable union of sets. Now we need to determine if each of these sets, $\\{q_n\\}$, is nowhere dense in the space $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nStep 2: Analyze whether a singleton set $\\{q_n\\}$ is nowhere dense in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nAccording to the definition, a set $A$ is nowhere dense if the interior of its closure is empty, i.e., $\\text{int}(\\bar{A}) = \\emptyset$. Let's apply this to the set $A_n = \\{q_n\\}$.\n\nFirst, we find the closure of $\\{q_n\\}$ in the metric space $(\\mathbb{Q}, d)$. In any metric space, a finite set of points is a closed set. Thus, the closure of a singleton set $\\{q_n\\}$ is the set itself:\n$$ \\overline{\\{q_n\\}} = \\{q_n\\} $$\n\nNext, we find the interior of this closure. The interior of a set $S$ consists of all points $p \\in S$ for which there exists an open ball centered at $p$ that is entirely contained within $S$. Here, we need to find the interior of $\\{q_n\\}$. Let's consider the only point in this set, $q_n$. For $q_n$ to be an interior point, there must exist some $\\epsilon  0$ such that the open ball $B(q_n, \\epsilon)$ is a subset of $\\{q_n\\}$.\n\nThe open ball in the metric space $(\\mathbb{Q}, d)$ is defined as:\n$$ B(q_n, \\epsilon) = \\{q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid |q_n - q|  \\epsilon \\} $$\nIt is a fundamental property of the rational numbers that between any two distinct rational numbers, there exists another rational number. This implies that for any $\\epsilon  0$, the open ball $B(q_n, \\epsilon)$ contains infinitely many rational numbers other than $q_n$. Therefore, for any $\\epsilon  0$, $B(q_n, \\epsilon)$ is not a subset of the singleton set $\\{q_n\\}$.\n\nSince there is no open ball centered at $q_n$ that is contained in $\\{q_n\\}$, the point $q_n$ is not an interior point of $\\{q_n\\}$. As $q_n$ is the only point in the set, the interior of $\\{q_n\\}$ is empty:\n$$ \\text{int}(\\{q_n\\}) = \\emptyset $$\n\nCombining these findings, the interior of the closure of $\\{q_n\\}$ is:\n$$ \\text{int}(\\overline{\\{q_n\\}}) = \\text{int}(\\{q_n\\}) = \\emptyset $$\nBy definition, this means that each singleton set $\\{q_n\\}$ is a nowhere dense set in the space $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nStep 3: Conclude whether $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Baire space.\nWe have shown that $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be written as a countable union of sets $\\{q_n\\}$, and that each of these sets is nowhere dense in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$$ \\mathbb{Q} = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\{q_n\\} \\quad \\text{where each } \\{q_n\\} \\text{ is nowhere dense in } \\mathbb{Q}. $$\nThis is precisely the definition of a meager set. Therefore, the space $\\mathbb{Q}$ is meager in itself.\n\nBy definition, a Baire space is a space that is *not* meager in itself. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is meager in itself, it is **not** a Baire space.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. No, because $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable and can be expressed as a countable union of its singleton points, each of which is a nowhere dense set in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This matches our derivation perfectly.\n- B. This is incorrect. The Baire Category Theorem does state that a complete metric space is a Baire space, but the metric space $(\\mathbb{Q}, d)$ is famously *not* complete. For instance, a sequence of rational numbers converging to an irrational number like $\\sqrt{2}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{Q}$ that does not have a limit in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n- C. This is incorrect. While $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ is a Baire space (as it is complete), the property of being a Baire space is not necessarily inherited by all dense subsets.\n- D. This is incorrect. The statement that every proper non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is nowhere dense is false. For example, the open interval $(0, 1) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its closure in $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[0, 1] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$, and the interior of this closure is $(0, 1) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$, which is not empty.\n- E. This is incorrect. It presents a consequence of being a Baire space as a reason. A space is a Baire space if and only if every non-empty open subset is of the second category (i.e. not meager). Option E states this as a justification for $\\mathbb{Q}$ being a Baire space, but we have proven that $\\mathbb{Q}$ itself is meager, invalidating the premise.\n\nThus, the only correct conclusion and justification is provided by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1575325"}, {"introduction": "After exploring a space that is meager in its entirety, we now investigate how meager sets can appear as subsets within a \"large\" Baire space.

This map is continuous, and $L_{m}=f_{m}^{-1}(\\{0\\})$. Since $\\{0\\}$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$, it follows that $L_{m}$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Similarly, define $g:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ by $g(x,y)=x$. Then $L_{\\infty}=g^{-1}(\\{0\\})$, so $L_{\\infty}$ is closed.\n\nNext, we show each $L_{m}$ has empty interior.
