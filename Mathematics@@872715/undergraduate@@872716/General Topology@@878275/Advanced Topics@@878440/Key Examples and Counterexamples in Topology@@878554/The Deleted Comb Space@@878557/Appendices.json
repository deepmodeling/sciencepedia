The Subspace Topology, $\\mathcal{T}_S$: This is the topology inherited by $X$ as a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with its standard Euclidean topology. An open set in $(X, \\mathcal{T}_S)$ is the intersection of an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with $X$.\n2. The Intrinsic Metric Topology, $\\mathcal{T}_L$: We first define a metric $d_L$ on $X$.

The length of a rectifiable path is a well-defined non-negative number. The distance $d_L(a, b)$ is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all rectifiable paths in $X$ connecting $a$ and $b$. This function $d_L$ is a metric, and it induces a metric topology $\\mathcal{T}_L$ on $X$, where the open sets are unions of open balls $B_{d_L}(x, r) = \\{y \\in X \\mid d_L(x, y)  r\\}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the subspace topology $\\mathcal{T}_S$ and the intrinsic metric topology $\\mathcal{T}_L$ on the set $X$?\n\nA.

The function $d_L$ is not a valid metric on all of $X$ because the distance between some pairs of points is infinite, so the question is ill-posed.", "solution": "Let $C=(K\\times[0,1])\\cup([0,1]\\times\\{0\\})$ with $K=\\{1/n\\mid n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}\\}\\cup\\{0\\}$, and let $X=C\\setminus\\{(0,1)\\}$. Define $d_{L}$ on $X$ as the intrinsic length metric: for $a,b\\in X$, $d_{L}(a,b)$ is the infimum of lengths of rectifiable paths in $X$ joining $a$ to $b$.\n\nFirst, $d_{L}$ is a valid metric on $X$. Indeed:\n- For any $a,b\\in X$, there is a rectifiable path in $X$ from $a$ to $b$: go vertically from $a=(x_{a},y_{a})$ to $(x_{a},0)$ (length $y_{a}$), move along the base $[0,1]\\times\\{0\\}$ from $x_{a}$ to $x_{b}$ (length $|x_{a}-x_{b}|$), then vertically up to $b=(x_{b},y_{b})$ (length $y_{b}$). Thus $d_{L}(a,b)\\leq y_{a}+|x_{a}-x_{b}|+y_{b}\\infty$.\n- For any rectifiable path $\\gamma$ from $a$ to $b$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, $\\operatorname{len}(\\gamma)\\geq d_{E}(a,b)$ where $d_{E}$ is the Euclidean distance. Taking the infimum over all such $\\gamma$ in $X$ yields $d_{E}(a,b)\\leq d_{L}(a,b)$. Hence $d_{L}(a,b)=0$ implies $d_{E}(a,b)=0$ and thus $a=b$. Symmetry is clear, and the triangle inequality follows from concatenation of paths and taking infima. Therefore $d_{L}$ is a metric, so option E is false.\n\nNext, compare the topologies $\\mathcal{T}_{S}$ (Euclidean subspace topology on $X$) and $\\mathcal{T}_{L}$ (metric topology from $d_{L}$).\n\nClaim 1: $\\mathcal{T}_{S}\\subset\\mathcal{T}_{L}$. Fix $p\\in X$ and let $U$ be a $\\mathcal{T}_{S}$-open neighborhood of $p$. Then there exists $\\varepsilon0$ with $B_{E}(p,\\varepsilon)\\cap X\\subset U$, where $B_{E}(p,\\varepsilon)$ is the Euclidean open ball. For any $q\\in B_{E}(p,\\varepsilon)\\cap X$, set $s=\\varepsilon-d_{E}(p,q)0$. If $z\\in X$ satisfies $d_{L}(q,z)s$, then\n$$\nd_{E}(p,z)\\leq d_{E}(p,q)+d_{E}(q,z)\\leq d_{E}(p,q)+d_{L}(q,z)d_{E}(p,q)+s=\\varepsilon,\n$$\nso $z\\in B_{E}(p,\\varepsilon)\\cap X\\subset U$. Hence for every $q\\in U$ there exists a $d_{L}$-ball $B_{d_L}(q,s)\\subset U$, proving $U\\in\\mathcal{T}_{L}$. Therefore $\\mathcal{T}_{S}\\subset\\mathcal{T}_{L}$.\n\nClaim 2: The inclusion is strict, i.e., $\\mathcal{T}_{S}\\neq\\mathcal{T}_{L}$. Choose $p=(0,y_{0})$ with $0y_{0}1$, and choose $r$ with $0ry_{0}$. We show\n$$\nB_{d_{L}}(p,r)=\\{(0,y)\\in X:|y-y_{0}|r\\}.\n$$\nFirst, if $q=(0,y)$ with $|y-y_{0}|r$, then the vertical segment in $X$ from $p$ to $q$ has length $|y-y_{0}|r$, so $q\\in B_{d_{L}}(p,r)$. Conversely, let $q\\in X$ lie either on the base $[0,1]\\times\\{0\\}$ or on a vertical at $x=1/n$. Any path in $X$ from $p$ to such $q$ must at least descend from $(0,y_{0})$ to $(0,0)$, contributing length at least $y_{0}$. Therefore $d_{L}(p,q)\\geq y_{0}r$, so no such $q$ lies in $B_{d_{L}}(p,r)$. Hence the displayed equality holds.\n\nHowever, the set $\\{(0,y):|y-y_{0}|r\\}$ is not open in the Euclidean subspace topology: every Euclidean ball around $p$ intersects $X$ in points on verticals $x=1/n$ with $y$ arbitrarily close to $y_{0}$, which are not in this set. Therefore $B_{d_{L}}(p,r)\\notin\\mathcal{T}_{S}$, proving $\\mathcal{T}_{S}\\subset\\mathcal{T}_{L}$ is strict.\n\nCombining Claims 1 and 2, we conclude that the metric topology $\\mathcal{T}_{L}$ is strictly finer than the subspace topology $\\mathcal{T}_{S}$.\n\nTherefore the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1580064"}]}
