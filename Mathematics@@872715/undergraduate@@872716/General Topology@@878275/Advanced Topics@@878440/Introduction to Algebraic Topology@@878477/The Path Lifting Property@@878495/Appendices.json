The Path Lifting Property guarantees not just the existence but also the uniqueness of a lift for a given starting point, a powerful tool for deducing properties of lifted paths.

The path lifting property states that for a covering map $p: E \\to B$, a path $f: [0,1] \\to B$ in the base space, and a point $e_0 \\in E$ such that $p(e_0) = f(0)$, there exists a unique path $\\tilde{f}: [0,1] \\to E$ called the lift of $f$, which satisfies two conditions: $\\tilde{f}(0) = e_0$ and $p \\circ \\tilde{f} = f$.\n\nLet $\\tilde{f}$ be the unique lift of a path $f: [0,1] \\to B$ starting at some point $e_0 \\in E$. Now, consider the reverse path of $f$, denoted by $\\bar{f}$, which is defined by the formula $\\bar{f}(t) = f(1-t)$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$. The starting point of this reverse path is $\\bar{f}(0) = f(1)$. A lift of $\\bar{f}$ must therefore start in the fiber $p^{-1}(f(1))$.

Since $\\bar{f}$ is the reverse of $f$, a natural candidate for its lift is the reverse of the original lift $\\tilde{f}$.

Verification of Continuity:**\nThe original lift $\\tilde{f}: [0,1] \\to E$ is a path, so it is continuous by definition. The function $h(t) = 1-t$ is a continuous map from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$. Our candidate path $g(t) = \\tilde{f}(1-t) = (\\tilde{f} \\circ h)(t)$ is a composition of two continuous functions. The composition of continuous functions is continuous, so $g(t)$ is continuous.\n\n**2. Verification of the Starting Point:**\nWe need to check the value of $g(t)$ at $t=0$.\n$$g(0) = \\tilde{f}(1-0) = \\tilde{f}(1)$$\nThis matches the required starting point for the lift of $\\bar{f}$, so the second condition is satisfied.\n\n**3. Verification of the Lifting Condition:**\nWe need to check if $p(g(t)) = \\bar{f}(t)$. Let's apply the covering map $p$ to our candidate path $g(t)$:\n$$p(g(t)) = p(\\tilde{f}(1-t))$$\nWe know that $\\tilde{f}$ is a lift of $f$, which means $p(\\tilde{f}(s)) = f(s)$ for any $s \\in [0,1]$.

Substituting this into our equation gives:\n$$p(g(t)) = \\bar{f}(t)$$\nThis shows that our candidate path $g(t)$ indeed projects down to the reverse path $\\bar{f}$.\n\nSince our proposed path $g(t) = \\tilde{f}(1-t)$ satisfies all three conditions (continuity, correct starting point, and the lifting condition), and since the path lifting property guarantees such a lift is unique, we must have:\n$$\\tilde{\\bar{f}}(t) = g(t) = \\tilde{f}(1-t)$$\nThus, the lift of the reverse path is the reverse of the original lift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\tilde{f}(1-t)}$$", "id": "1585912"}, {"introduction": "Path lifting reveals the deep connection between a space's fundamental group and its covering spaces, a concept that extends far beyond the circle.
