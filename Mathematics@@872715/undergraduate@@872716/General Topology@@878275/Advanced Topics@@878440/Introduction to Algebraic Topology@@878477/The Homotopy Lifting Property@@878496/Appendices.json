By finding the unique lift of a path from the torus to the plane, you will practice applying the core principles of path lifting, where continuity and a specified starting point eliminate all ambiguity.

The initial condition: $\\tilde{\\gamma}(0) = (0,0)$.\n2. The projection condition: $p(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = \\gamma(t)$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nLet the path in the plane be represented by its component functions: $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$. The projection map is given by $p$, and the path on the torus is $\\gamma(t) = p(\\sin(\\pi t), 2t)$.\n\nThe projection condition $p(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = \\gamma(t)$ can be written as:\n$$p(x(t), y(t)) = p(\\sin(\\pi t), 2t)$$\nBy the definition of the equivalence relation on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that defines the torus $T^2$, two points project to the same point on the torus if and only if their coordinates differ by integers. Therefore, for each $t \\in [0, 1]$, there must exist integers, which may depend on $t$, say $n(t)$ and $m(t)$, such that:\n$$x(t) - \\sin(\\pi t) = n(t)$$\n$$y(t) - 2t = m(t)$$\nwhere $n(t) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $m(t) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nWe can express the path $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ in terms of these integer-valued functions:\n$$\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = (x(t), y(t)) = (\\sin(\\pi t) + n(t), 2t + m(t))$$\nThe problem states that the path $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ must be continuous. The functions $\\sin(\\pi t)$ and $2t$ are continuous functions of $t$. The sum of continuous functions is continuous. Therefore, for $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ to be continuous, the functions $n(t)$ and $m(t)$ must also be continuous.\n\nSo, $n: [0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ and $m: [0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ are continuous functions. The domain $[0, 1]$ is a connected topological space. The codomain $\\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of integers) with the standard topology inherited from $\\mathbb{R}$ is a discrete space. A continuous function from a connected space to a discrete space must be constant. If it were not constant, the image would contain at least two distinct points. Since the codomain is discrete, we could find disjoint open sets around these points whose preimages would be disjoint non-empty open sets in the domain, contradicting the connectedness of the domain.\n\nThus, $n(t)$ and $m(t)$ must be constant integers.
