This first exercise challenges you to apply the definition of a retract to several different topological settings, from the coarse indiscrete topology to familiar spaces on the real line.

Let $X$ have the indiscrete topology and $A \\subseteq X$ be nonempty, with $A$ carrying the subspace topology. The subspace topology on $A$ is indiscrete; because the only open sets in $X$ are $\\emptyset$ and $X$, the only open sets in $A$ are $\\emptyset \\cap A = \\emptyset$ and $X \\cap A = A$. A function $r: X \\to A$ is continuous if for every open $U \\subseteq A$, $r^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. Since the only open sets in $A$ are $\\emptyset$ and $A$, their preimages are $\\emptyset$ and $X$, which are open in $X$, hence every function $r: X \\to A$ is continuous. Define $r$ by $r(a)=a$ for all $a \\in A$ and define $r$ arbitrarily on $X \\setminus A$ with values in $A$. Then $r$ is continuous and $r|_{A}=\\operatorname{id}_{A}$, so $A$ is a retract.

For any function $r: X \\to A$ and any open $U \\subseteq A$, $r^{-1}(U)$ is a union of singletons $\\{x\\}$ with $x \\in X$ such that $r(x) \\in U$.

Equivalently, observe that $[0,1]$ and $[2,3]$ are connected, and the continuous image of a connected set into the discrete space $A$ must be a singleton; the endpoint conditions force the constants $0$ and $3$ on the respective components.\n\nD.
