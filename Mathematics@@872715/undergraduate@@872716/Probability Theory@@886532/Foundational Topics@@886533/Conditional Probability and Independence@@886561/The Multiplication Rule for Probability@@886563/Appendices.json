In Phase 1, a blood sample is analyzed. Based on extensive preliminary data, there is a probability of $0.280$ that the Phase 1 test will return an 'ambiguous' result, which is neither clearly positive nor clearly negative.\n\nIf a participant's Phase 1 result is ambiguous, they proceed to Phase 2. The Phase 2 protocol involves a more sophisticated test using a fluorescent marker assay. This assay is designed to resolve the ambiguity. For participants who had an ambiguous result in Phase 1, the probability that the Phase 2 assay will yield a 'conclusive' result (either definitively positive or definitively negative) is $0.950$. If the Phase 1 result is not ambiguous, the participant does not undergo the Phase 2 test.\n\nConsider a randomly selected participant entering the screening process. What is the probability that this participant will receive an ambiguous result in Phase 1 and also a conclusive result in Phase 2?
