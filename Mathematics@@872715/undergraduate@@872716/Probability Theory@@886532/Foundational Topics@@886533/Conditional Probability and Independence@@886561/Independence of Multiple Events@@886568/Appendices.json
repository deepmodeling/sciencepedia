For each question, there are $M$ possible answers, of which only one is correct. A student who has not studied for the exam decides to guess a random answer for each of the three questions.\n\nLet $C_i$ be the event that the student answers question $i$ correctly, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\nLet $I_i$ be the event that the student answers question $i$ incorrectly, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the probability that the student answers only the first question correctly, in terms of $M$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that the student answers the first question correctly AND the second question incorrectly AND the third question incorrectly. This corresponds to the intersection of the events $C_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$. We need to find $P(C_1 \\cap I_2 \\cap I_3)$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the probabilities of the individual events for any given question $i$. Since there are $M$ possible answers and only one is correct, the probability of guessing the correct answer for any question $i$ is:\n$$\nP(C_i) = \\frac{1}{M}\n$$\n\nThe event of answering a question incorrectly, $I_i$, is the complement of answering it correctly, $C_i$. Therefore, the probability of guessing the incorrect answer for any question $i$ is:\n$$\nP(I_i) = 1 - P(C_i) = 1 - \\frac{1}{M}\n$$\nThis can be written as a single fraction:\n$$\nP(I_i) = \\frac{M - 1}{M}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the questions are independent. This means that the outcome of one question does not affect the outcome of another. For independent events, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$$\nP(C_1 \\cap I_2 \\cap I_3) = P(C_1) \\times P(I_2) \\times P(I_3)\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the individual probabilities into this equation:\n$$\nP(C_1 \\cap I_2 \\cap I_3) = \\left(\\frac{1}{M}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{M-1}{M}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{M-1}{M}\\right)\n$$\n\nMultiplying the terms gives the final expression:\n$$\nP(C_1 \\cap I_2 \\cap I_3) = \\frac{1 \\cdot (M-1) \\cdot (M-1)}{M \\cdot M \\cdot M} = \\frac{(M-1)^2}{M^3}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{(M-1)^2}{M^3}}\n$$", "id": "8921"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the previous concept, we now explore scenarios where the event of interest is a combination of several possible outcomes.
