The winner is promised a significant company-wide bonus. Based on extensive historical performance data, it is known that for any potential client, Team Alpha has a probability $p=0.6$ of securing the contract, while Team Bravo has a probability of $1-p=0.4$. Each contract negotiation is considered an independent event.\n\nDue to a sudden and unexpected change in market conditions, executive leadership decides to halt the competition indefinitely. At the time of the stoppage, Team Alpha has secured 45 contracts and Team Bravo has secured 42 contracts. To award the bonus fairly, the company decides to calculate the theoretical probability that each team would have won had the competition continued under the same conditions.\n\nWhat is the probability that Team Alpha would have been the first to reach 50 contracts?

At the stoppage, Alpha needs $r=50-45=5$ additional wins, and Bravo needs $s=50-42=8$ additional wins. The probability that Alpha reaches its quota of $r$ wins before Bravo accumulates $s$ wins is the probability that the $r$-th success occurs before $s$ failures in a sequence of Bernoulli trials.\n\nBy the negative binomial distribution, the probability that the $r$-th success occurs after exactly $j$ failures is\n$$\n\\binom{j+r-1}{r-1} p^{r} q^{j}.\n$$\nTherefore, the probability that Alpha reaches $r$ successes before Bravo reaches $s$ is\n$$\nP_{\\text{Alpha}}=\\sum_{j=0}^{s-1}\\binom{j+r-1}{r-1} p^{r} q^{j}.\n$$\nSubstituting $r=5$, $s=8$, $p=0.6$, and $q=0.4$,\n$$\nP_{\\text{Alpha}}=0.6^{5}\\sum_{j=0}^{7}\\binom{j+4}{4} (0.4)^{j}.\n$$\nCompute the components:\n$$\n0.6^{5}=0.07776,\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{7}\\binom{j+4}{4} (0.4)^{j}\n=1+5(0.4)+15(0.16)+35(0.064)+70(0.0256)+126(0.01024)+210(0.004096)+330(0.0016384)\n=12.123072.\n$$\nHence,\n$$\nP_{\\text{Alpha}}=0.07776\\times 12.123072=0.94269007872.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is $0.9427$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9427}$$", "id": "1405106"}, {"introduction": "How does the analysis change when the contest has a fixed total number of rounds, and the winner is simply the player with more wins at the end?

Consequently, Bob has a probability of $1-p = 0.45$ of winning any single round.
