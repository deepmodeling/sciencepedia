Based on ancient legends, the probability that the chest is magically locked is $3/5$. If the chest is not locked, the treasure can be accessed immediately. If the chest is locked, the hunter must attempt to pick the lock. The hunter's skill is such that the probability of successfully picking the lock, given that it is locked, is $1/4$.\n\nWhat is the overall probability that the treasure hunter will be able to access the treasure inside the chest? Provide your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "Let $L$ denote the event that the chest is locked and $U$ the event that it is unlocked, with $U = L^{c}$. Let $S$ denote the event that the treasure is accessed. We are given $P(L) = \\frac{3}{5}$, hence $P(U) = 1 - P(L) = 1 - \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$. If the chest is unlocked, the treasure is accessed with certainty, so $P(S \\mid U) = 1$. If the chest is locked, the probability of successfully picking the lock is $P(S \\mid L) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nBy the law of total probability,\n$$\nP(S) = P(S \\mid U)P(U) + P(S \\mid L)P(L).\n$$\nSubstituting the given probabilities,\n$$\nP(S) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{3}{20}.\n$$\nExpressing with a common denominator,\n$$\n\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{8}{20} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad P(S) = \\frac{8}{20} + \\frac{3}{20} = \\frac{11}{20}.\n$$\nTherefore, the overall probability that the treasure hunter can access the treasure is $\\frac{11}{20}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{11}{20}}$$", "id": "1408415"}, {"introduction": "After calculating a final outcome's probability, we often need to work backward and update our beliefs based on new information. This exercise introduces the concept of inverse probability using the famous Bayes' Theorem [@problem_id:1408389].

From extensive historical data, the restaurant manager knows that 60% of patrons choose the prix-fixe menu, while the remaining 40% order à la carte.\n\nThe restaurant is particularly famous for its Tarte Tatin. A patron who selects the prix-fixe menu has a 50% chance of choosing the Tarte Tatin from the available dessert options. A patron ordering à la carte, who has a wider dessert menu to choose from, has a 20% chance of ordering the Tarte Tatin.\n\nA waiter is carrying a freshly prepared Tarte Tatin to a table, but you do not know which menu the patron at that table selected. Given only this observation, what is the probability that the patron chose the prix-fixe menu?\n\nExpress your answer as an exact fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "Let's define the events for our probabilistic model.\nLet $F$ be the event that a patron chooses the prix-fixe menu.\nLet $A$ be the event that a patron orders à la carte.\nLet $T$ be the event that a patron has the Tarte Tatin for dessert.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe probability of a patron choosing the prix-fixe menu is $P(F) = 0.60$.\nThe probability of a patron ordering à la carte is $P(A) = 0.40$. Note that $P(A) = 1 - P(F)$.\n\nWe are also given the conditional probabilities of a patron choosing the Tarte Tatin, given their menu choice:\nThe probability of choosing the Tarte Tatin given the prix-fixe menu was selected is $P(T|F) = 0.50$.\nThe probability of choosing the Tarte Tatin given the à la carte menu was selected is $P(T|A) = 0.20$.\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the patron chose the prix-fixe menu, given that they ordered a Tarte Tatin. This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(F|T)$.\n\nTo find this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which states:\n$$P(F|T) = \\frac{P(T|F) P(F)}{P(T)}$$\n\nWe know $P(T|F)$ and $P(F)$, but we first need to calculate $P(T)$, the total probability that any randomly chosen patron orders a Tarte Tatin. We can find this using the Law of Total Probability. A patron can order a Tarte Tatin either by having chosen the prix-fixe menu or by having ordered à la carte. These are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.\nThe formula for the Law of Total Probability is:\n$$P(T) = P(T|F)P(F) + P(T|A)P(A)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this formula:\n$$P(T) = (0.50)(0.60) + (0.20)(0.40)$$\n$$P(T) = 0.30 + 0.08$$\n$$P(T) = 0.38$$\n\nSo, the overall probability that a patron orders a Tarte Tatin is 0.38.\n\nNow we can substitute this value back into our Bayes' Theorem formula for $P(F|T)$:\n$$P(F|T) = \\frac{P(T|F) P(F)}{P(T)}$$\n$$P(F|T) = \\frac{(0.50)(0.60)}{0.38}$$\n$$P(F|T) = \\frac{0.30}{0.38}$$\n\nTo express this as an exact fraction in simplest form, we can write the decimals as fractions:\n$$P(F|T) = \\frac{30/100}{38/100} = \\frac{30}{38}$$\n\nNow, we simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n$$P(F|T) = \\frac{30 \\div 2}{38 \\div 2} = \\frac{15}{19}$$\n\nThus, the probability that the patron chose the prix-fixe menu given they ordered a Tarte Tatin is $\\frac{15}{19}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{15}{19}}$$", "id": "1408389"}, {"introduction": "Tree diagrams are not just for calculating the probability of a single event; they can also be used to analyze the expected outcomes of a random process.
