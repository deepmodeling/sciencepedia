Your answer should be expressed in terms of the time $t$ and the maximum lifetime $C$, and it is to be considered valid for the interval $0 \\le t  C$.", "solution": "The hazard rate function, $h(t)$, for a continuous random variable $T$ representing lifetime is defined as the ratio of the Probability Density Function (PDF), $f(t)$, to the survival function, $S(t)$. The formula is:\n$$h(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$$\nThe survival function $S(t)$ is the probability that the component lasts longer than time $t$, i.e., $S(t) = P(T  t)$. It can be calculated as $S(t) = 1 - F(t)$, where $F(t)$ is the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), defined as $F(t) = P(T \\le t)$.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the PDF, $f(t)$, for the given distribution. The lifetime $T$ follows a continuous uniform distribution on the interval $[0, C]$. For a uniform distribution, the PDF is constant over the interval and zero elsewhere. The total probability over the interval must be 1.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{C} f(t) dt = 1 $$\nLet $f(t) = k$ for $0 \\le t \\le C$.

So, the PDF is:\n$$ f(t) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{C}  \\text{if } 0 \\le t \\le C \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the CDF, $F(t)$, for $0 \\le t  C$.

We are interested in the interval $0 \\le t  C$.\n$$ h(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)} = \\frac{1/C}{(C-t)/C} $$\nThe term $1/C$ in the numerator and the denominator cancels out.\n$$ h(t) = \\frac{1}{C-t} $$\nThis is the expression for the hazard rate function for a component with a lifetime uniformly distributed on $[0, C]$, valid for $0 \\le t  C$.
