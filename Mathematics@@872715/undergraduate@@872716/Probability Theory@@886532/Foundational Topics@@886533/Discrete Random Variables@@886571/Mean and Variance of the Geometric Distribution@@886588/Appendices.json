Due to solar flares and cosmic radiation, there is a constant probability $p$ that any given packet gets corrupted during transmission. The transmissions of individual packets are independent events. The ground station's protocol involves continuously monitoring the stream of packets and initiating a full system reset as soon as the first corrupted packet is detected. Let the random variable $N$ be the total number of packets sent, including the first corrupted packet that triggers the reset. Find a symbolic expression for the variance of $N$ in terms of the probability $p$.", "solution": "The problem describes a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial is the transmission of a single data packet. We can define a \"success\" as a packet being corrupted, which occurs with probability $p$. The random variable $N$ represents the number of trials required to observe the first success. This is the definition of a geometric random variable.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for $N$ is given by $P(N=k) = (1-p)^{k-1}p$ for $k=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. This is because for the first success to occur on the $k$-th trial, we must have $k-1$ failures (uncorrupted packets), each with probability $1-p$, followed by one success (a corrupted packet), with probability $p$.\n\nThe variance of a random variable $N$ is defined as $\\text{Var}(N) = E[N^2] - (E[N])^2$. We will compute the first moment (mean) $E[N]$ and the second moment $E[N^2]$.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean, $E[N]$. By definition,\n$$E[N] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k P(N=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k (1-p)^{k-1}p$$\nLet $q = 1-p$. The expression becomes\n$$E[N] = p \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k q^{k-1}$$\nWe use the formula for a geometric series: for $|q|<1$, $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} q^k = \\frac{1}{1-q}$. Differentiating both sides with respect to $q$ gives:\n$$\\frac{d}{dq} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} q^k = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k q^{k-1} = \\frac{d}{dq} \\left(\\frac{1}{1-q}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(1-q)^2}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $E[N]$:\n$$E[N] = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-q)^2} = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-(1-p))^2} = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{p^2} = \\frac{1}{p}$$\n\nNext, we find the second moment, $E[N^2]$.\n$$E[N^2] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k^2 P(N=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k^2 (1-p)^{k-1}p = p \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k^2 q^{k-1}$$\nTo evaluate this sum, it is easier to first compute $E[N(N-1)]$.\n$$E[N(N-1)] = E[N^2 - N] = E[N^2] - E[N]$$\nLet's compute $E[N(N-1)]$ from its definition:\n$$E[N(N-1)] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k(k-1)P(N=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k(k-1) p q^{k-1} = p \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} k(k-1) q^{k-1}$$\nTo evaluate this sum, we differentiate the geometric series formula twice. We already have the first derivative: $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k q^{k-1} = \\frac{1}{(1-q)^2}$. Differentiating again with respect to $q$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dq} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k q^{k-1} = \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} k(k-1) q^{k-2} = \\frac{d}{dq} \\left(\\frac{1}{(1-q)^2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{(1-q)^3}$$\nMultiplying by $q$ does not give us the sum we want, so let's adjust the sum from $E[N(N-1)]$:\n$$E[N(N-1)] = p \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} k(k-1) q^{k-1} = pq \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} k(k-1) q^{k-2}$$\nNow we can substitute the second derivative result:\n$$E[N(N-1)] = pq \\left( \\frac{2}{(1-q)^3} \\right) = p(1-p) \\frac{2}{(1-(1-p))^3} = p(1-p) \\frac{2}{p^3} = \\frac{2(1-p)}{p^2}$$\nNow we can find $E[N^2]$ using the relation $E[N^2] = E[N(N-1)] + E[N]$.\n$$E[N^2] = \\frac{2(1-p)}{p^2} + \\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{2(1-p) + p}{p^2} = \\frac{2 - 2p + p}{p^2} = \\frac{2-p}{p^2}$$\nFinally, we can calculate the variance:\n$$\\text{Var}(N) = E[N^2] - (E[N])^2 = \\frac{2-p}{p^2} - \\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2-p}{p^2} - \\frac{1}{p^2} = \\frac{2-p-1}{p^2} = \\frac{1-p}{p^2}$$\nThus, the variance of the number of packets sent until the first corruption is $\\frac{1-p}{p^2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1-p}{p^{2}}}$$", "id": "1373232"}, {"introduction": "This next problem encourages you to think like a data scientist.
