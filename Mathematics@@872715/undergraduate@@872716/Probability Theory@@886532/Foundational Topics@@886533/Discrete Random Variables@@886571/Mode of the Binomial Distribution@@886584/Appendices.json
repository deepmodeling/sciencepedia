This occurs when $(n+1)p$ is not an integer, which means $p$ cannot be $40/51$ (which would lead to bimodal case with modes 39 and 40). Thus, strictly speaking, $p$ must be in the half-open interval $(\\frac{40}{51}, \\frac{41}{51})$. However, the question asks for the closed interval $[a, b]$ that confines these values.
