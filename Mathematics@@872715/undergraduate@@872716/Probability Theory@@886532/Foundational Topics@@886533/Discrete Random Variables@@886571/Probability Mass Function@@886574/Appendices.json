This exercise guides you through a classic coin-toss experiment to define a random variable and then systematically determine its PMF.

Let the random variable $X$ represent the length of the longest sequence of consecutive heads, also known as the longest run of heads. For example, if the outcome of the three tosses is HTH, there are two separate runs of heads, each of length 1. The longest of these has length 1, so for this outcome, $X=1$. If the outcome is TTT, there are no heads, so the length of the longest run of heads is 0, and thus $X=0$.\n\nYour task is to determine the Probability Mass Function (PMF), which we will denote as $f(k) = P(X=k)$, for this random variable.
