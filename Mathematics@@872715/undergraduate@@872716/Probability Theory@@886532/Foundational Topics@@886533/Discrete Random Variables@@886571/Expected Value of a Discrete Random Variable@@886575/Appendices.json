This first exercise [@problem_id:1361824] reverses the typical calculation; instead of computing an expectation from known probabilities, you will use a given average value—analogous to an experimental measurement—to deduce the underlying probability of a system's state. This practice solidifies your understanding of the direct relationship between probabilities, outcomes, and their weighted average.", "problem": "A physicist is investigating a simplified model of a two-level quantum system. When a measurement is performed, the system collapses into one of two distinct energy states: the ground state, which has an energy of $E_0$, or the excited state, which has an energy of $E_1$. For a particular preparation of the system, the probability of it collapsing to the ground state upon measurement is $p$, and consequently, the probability of it collapsing to the excited state is $1-p$.\n\nThrough a large number of repeated experiments on identically prepared systems, the physicist determines that the average measured energy of the system is $\\langle E \\rangle$.\n\nGiven that the energy levels are $E_0 = -1.2 \\text{ eV}$ and $E_1 = 3.8 \\text{ eV}$, and the experimentally determined average energy is $\\langle E \\rangle = 2.5 \\text{ eV}$, determine the value of the probability $p$.

This property allows us to effortlessly find the expectation of a linear function of a random variable, such as $aX+b$, without needing to compute its full probability distribution. This exercise [@problem_id:1361825] demonstrates this principle in a practical scenario, showing how to calculate an expected quality score that depends on a random noise component.", "problem": "In the field of digital imaging, a single pixel in a scientific-grade Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) is being analyzed for noise. During a standardized exposure time in a thermally controlled environment, the number of spurious \"dark current\" electrons, denoted by the random variable $X$, that are generated is found to follow a Poisson distribution with a mean of $\\lambda$. A quality score, $Y$, is assigned to the pixel's performance for this exposure. The score starts at a maximum value of 10 points, and 2 points are deducted for each dark current electron detected. Determine the expected value of the quality score, $E[Y]$, for a single exposure. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\lambda$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected value of the quality score, $Y$. We are given the relationship between the quality score $Y$ and the number of dark current electrons $X$. The score starts at 10 and decreases by 2 for each electron. This can be expressed as a linear transformation of the random variable $X$:\n$$Y = 10 - 2X$$\n\nWe are told that the number of dark current electrons, $X$, follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of $\\lambda$. A key property of the Poisson distribution is that its expected value is equal to its mean parameter. Therefore, the expected value of $X$ is:\n$$E[X] = \\lambda$$\n\nTo find the expected value of $Y$, we use the linearity of expectation. For any random variable $X$ and constants $a$ and $b$, the expectation of a linear transformation $aX+b$ is given by:\n$$E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b$$\n\nIn our problem, we can identify the constants $a = -2$ and $b = 10$ from the expression for $Y$:\n$$Y = (-2)X + 10$$\n\nApplying the property of linearity of expectation to $Y$:\n$$E[Y] = E[-2X + 10]$$\n$$E[Y] = -2E[X] + E[10]$$\n\nThe expectation of a constant is the constant itself, so $E[10] = 10$. We can now substitute the known values for $E[X]$ and $E[10]$ into the equation:\n$$E[Y] = -2(\\lambda) + 10$$\n\nRearranging the terms gives the final expression for the expected quality score:\n$$E[Y] = 10 - 2\\lambda$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10 - 2\\lambda}$$", "id": "1361825"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem tackles a more complex and dynamic scenario: determining the average waiting time for a specific sequence of events.
