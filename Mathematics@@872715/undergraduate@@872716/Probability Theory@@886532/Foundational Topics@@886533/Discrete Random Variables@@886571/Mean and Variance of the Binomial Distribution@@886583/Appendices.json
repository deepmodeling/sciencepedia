Each microprocessor is tested, and the outcome is classified as either 'functional' (a success) or 'defective' (a failure). The total number of microprocessors in the sample is denoted by $n$. The tests are independent, and the probability, $p$, that any given microprocessor is functional is constant across the sample. The number of functional microprocessors in the sample can be modeled by a binomial distribution.\n\nFrom extensive historical data on this testing process, it has been established that the expected number of functional microprocessors in a sample is 12, and the variance of the number of functional microprocessors is 3.\n\nDetermine the size of the sample, $n$, and the probability of success, $p$.", "solution": "Let $X$ denote the number of functional microprocessors in a sample of size $n$.
