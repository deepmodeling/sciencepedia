Let $X_1, X_2, \\dots$ be the sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) positive random variables representing the times between consecutive events. These are called inter-arrival times. The total number of events that have occurred by time $t$ is denoted by $N(t)$. The renewal function, $m(t)$, is defined as the expected number of events by time $t$, i.e., $m(t) = E[N(t)]$.\n\nA fundamental relationship in renewal theory is the integral renewal equation, which connects the renewal function $m(t)$ to the cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F(t)$, of the inter-arrival times:\n$$m(t) = F(t) + \\int_0^t m(t-x) f(x) \\,dx$$\nwhere $f(x) = F'(x)$ is the probability density function (PDF) of the inter-arrival times.\n\nConsider a special case of a renewal process known as a Poisson process. In a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda > 0$, the inter-arrival times $X_i$ follow an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nUsing the provided integral renewal equation, determine the analytical expression for the renewal function $m(t)$ for a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$.", "solution": "We start from the integral renewal equation for the renewal function $m(t)$:\n$$\nm(t) = F(t) + \\int_{0}^{t} m(t-x) f(x)\\,dx,\n$$\nwhere $F$ is the CDF and $f$ is the PDF of the inter-arrival time distribution.

Denote by $M(s)$, $F^{\\ast}(s)$, and $f^{\\ast}(s)$ the Laplace transforms of $m(t)$, $F(t)$, and $f(t)$, respectively. Using the convolution property, the transform of the integral term is $M(s) f^{\\ast}(s)$.

After the yellow light ends, the system waits for a suitable gap in the cross-traffic before switching to green. This waiting time, which constitutes the red phase duration, is a random variable.
