New subscribers join the platform at a constant average rate of $\\lambda$ per day, regardless of the current number of subscribers. Individual subscribers may cancel their service, and it is assumed that the cancellation decisions are independent. Consequently, if there are $i$ subscribers on the platform, the total rate at which subscriptions are cancelled is $\\mu i$ per day, where $\\mu$ is a positive constant representing the per-subscriber cancellation rate.\n\nAfter the platform has been active for a sufficiently long time, the number of subscribers is observed to fluctuate around a stable average, indicating that the system has reached a stationary state.
