The chain has three communicating classes: $\\{S_1\\}$, $\\{S_2, S_3\\}$, and $\\{S_4\\}$.", "solution": "To determine the correct description of the Markov chain, we need to identify its communicating classes. Two states, $i$ and $j$, are said to communicate, denoted $i \\leftrightarrow j$, if state $j$ is reachable from state $i$ and state $i$ is reachable from state $j$. A communicating class is a maximal set of states in which every pair of states communicates. A Markov chain is irreducible if all states belong to a single communicating class.\n\nLet's analyze the reachability between the states using the given transition probabilities $p_1 = 0.4$ and $p_3 = 0.7$. A transition from state $i$ to state $j$ is possible if the transition probability $P_{ij}$ is greater than zero.\n\nThe transition probabilities are:\n- $P_{11} = 1 - p_1 = 0.6$\n- $P_{12} = p_1 = 0.4$\n- $P_{23} = 1$\n- $P_{32} = 1 - p_3 = 0.3$\n- $P_{34} = p_3 = 0.7$\n- $P_{43} = 1$\nAll other transition probabilities are zero.\n\nLet's examine the communication relationships.\n\n1.  **Start with state $S_1$**:\n    - Can $S_1$ reach other states? Yes. There is a path $S_1 \\to S_2$ since $P_{12} = 0.4  0$. From $S_2$, the system must go to $S_3$ ($P_{23}=1$). From $S_3$, it can reach $S_4$ ($P_{34}=0.70$). Thus, $S_1$ can reach $S_2$, $S_3$, and $S_4$.\n    - Can other states reach $S_1$? Let's check for any transitions into $S_1$. The only transitions into $S_1$ would be $P_{11}, P_{21}, P_{31}, P_{41}$. We have $P_{11}  0$, but $P_{21}=0$, $P_{31}=0$, and $P_{41}=0$. This means that once the system leaves state $S_1$, it can never return.\n    - Since $S_2$ cannot reach $S_1$, $S_1$ and $S_2$ do not communicate ($S_1 \\not\\leftrightarrow S_2$). By extension, $S_1$ does not communicate with $S_3$ or $S_4$.\n    - Therefore, $\\{S_1\\}$ forms a communicating class by itself. Since it is possible to leave this state (with probability $p_1=0.4$) and never return, state $S_1$ is a transient state.\n\n2.  **Examine the remaining states $\\{S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$**:\n    - **Communication between $S_2$ and $S_3$**:\n        - Can $S_2$ reach $S_3$? Yes, $P_{23} = 1  0$.\n        - Can $S_3$ reach $S_2$? Yes, $P_{32} = 0.3  0$.\n        - So, $S_2$ and $S_3$ communicate: $S_2 \\leftrightarrow S_3$.\n    - **Communication between $S_3$ and $S_4$**:\n        - Can $S_3$ reach $S_4$? Yes, $P_{34} = 0.7  0$.\n        - Can $S_4$ reach $S_3$? Yes, $P_{43} = 1  0$.\n        - So, $S_3$ and $S_4$ communicate: $S_3 \\leftrightarrow S_4$.\n    - **Communication between $S_2$ and $S_4$**:\n        - Since communication is a transitive relation ($S_2 \\leftrightarrow S_3$ and $S_3 \\leftrightarrow S_4$), we can conclude that $S_2 \\leftrightarrow S_4$. Let's verify:\n        - Path from $S_2$ to $S_4$: $S_2 \\to S_3 \\to S_4$. This path exists.\n        - Path from $S_4$ to $S_2$: $S_4 \\to S_3 \\to S_2$. This path exists.\n        - So, $S_2$ and $S_4$ communicate as well.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**:\n    - The states $\\{S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$ form a single communicating class because every state in this set communicates with every other state in the set, and no state outside this set communicates with them.\n    - This class is closed because there are no transitions from any state in $\\{S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$ to state $S_1$. Once the chain enters this class, it can never leave. This means $\\{S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$ is a recurrent class.\n    - The chain is not irreducible because it has more than one communicating class.\n    - The communicating classes are $\\{S_1\\}$ and $\\{S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$.\n    - State $S_1$ is transient, as it is possible to leave the state and impossible to return.\n\nComparing our findings with the given options:\n- A is incorrect because the chain is not irreducible.\n- B is incorrect because $S_2$ and $S_3$ are in the same class.\n- C is correct. It correctly identifies the two communicating classes, $\\{S_1\\}$ and $\\{S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$, and correctly identifies $S_1$ as transient.\n- D is incorrect as it misidentifies the classes. Also, $S_4$ is not an absorbing state because it is possible to leave it ($P_{43}=1$). An absorbing state $i$ must have $P_{ii}=1$.\n- E is incorrect as there are only two communicating classes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1312394"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of reachability, this exercise explores how the numerical values of transition probabilities determine a chain's irreducibility.
