An edge between any two vertices, representing a friendship, exists with a fixed probability $p$, independent of all other edges.\n\nA key structure in social network analysis is the 'open triad'. An open triad is defined as a set of three distinct individuals, let's call them Alex, Beth, and Chris, where exactly two friendships exist among them. For instance, Alex is friends with Beth, and Beth is friends with Chris, but Alex and Chris are not friends. This arrangement forms a two-step path between Alex and Chris.\n\nYour task is to calculate the expected number of distinct open triads in this network model.
