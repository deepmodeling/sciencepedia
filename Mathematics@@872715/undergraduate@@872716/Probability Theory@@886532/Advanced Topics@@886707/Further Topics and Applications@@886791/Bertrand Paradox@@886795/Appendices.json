A 'random chord' is to be generated within this circle. However, the term 'random' can be interpreted in several ways. Three different procedures are proposed to generate such a chord:\n\n**Procedure 1:** Two points are chosen independently and with a uniform probability distribution on the circumference of the circle. The chord is the straight line segment connecting these two points.\n\n**Procedure 2:** A radius of the circle is chosen with a uniform probability distribution over all possible angles, and then a point is chosen with a uniform probability distribution along the length of this radius. The chord is defined as the unique line segment that has the chosen point as its midpoint and is perpendicular to the chosen radius. Note that this procedure is equivalent to choosing a radius and then constructing a chord perpendicular to it at a random distance from the center.\n\n**Procedure 3:** A single point is chosen with a uniform probability distribution from the entire area of the circle's interior. This point is taken to be the midpoint of the generated chord.\n\nFor each of these three procedures, calculate the probability that the generated chord subtends an angle at the center of the circle that is less than $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians.
