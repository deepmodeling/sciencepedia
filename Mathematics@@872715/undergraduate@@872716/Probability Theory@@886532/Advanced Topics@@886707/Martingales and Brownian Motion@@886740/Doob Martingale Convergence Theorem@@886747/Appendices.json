We will model the growth of a bacterial colony as a branching process, a fundamental tool in biology, physics, and computer science. While this problem can be solved directly, it serves as a powerful illustration of a system where the Doob Martingale Convergence Theorem provides deep insights into the long-term behavior and probability of ultimate extinction or survival [@problem_id:1359221].", "problem": "A single, genetically engineered bacterium is placed in a nutrient-rich petri dish. At the end of each second, this bacterium, and any of its descendants, will either perish with probability $q$ or divide into two identical bacteria with probability $p$. For this process, a bacterium cannot remain as a single entity; it must either perish or divide, so $p+q=1$. Each bacterium in the colony behaves independently and according to these same probabilities. The colony is considered to have survived if its population does not go to zero in the long run. Assume that the probability of splitting, $p$, is strictly greater than the probability of perishing, $q$.\n\nDetermine the long-term probability that the initial bacterium gives rise to a colony that survives indefinitely. Your answer should be a closed-form expression in terms of $p$ and $q$.", "solution": "Model the colony as a Galton–Watson branching process with offspring distribution: each bacterium has either 0 offspring with probability $q$ (perishes) or 2 offspring with probability $p$ (splits), with $p+q=1$. Let $s$ denote the extinction probability starting from a single bacterium. By the branching property and independence, extinction occurs either immediately (with probability $q$) or, if the initial bacterium splits (with probability $p$), if both descendant lineages go extinct independently, which has probability $s^{2}$. Thus $s$ satisfies\n$$\ns = q + p s^{2}.\n$$\nRewriting gives the quadratic\n$$\np s^{2} - s + q = 0.\n$$\nSolving,\n$$\ns = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4 p q}}{2 p}.\n$$\nUsing $p+q=1$, compute the discriminant:\n$$\n1 - 4 p q = 1 - 4 p (1 - p) = (1 - 2 p)^{2}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\ns = \\frac{1 \\pm |1 - 2 p|}{2 p}.\n$$\nGiven $pq$ and $p+q=1$, we have $p\\frac{1}{2}$, so $|1 - 2 p| = 2 p - 1$.
