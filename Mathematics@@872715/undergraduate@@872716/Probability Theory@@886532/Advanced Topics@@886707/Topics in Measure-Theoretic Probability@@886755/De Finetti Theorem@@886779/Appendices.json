This first practice demonstrates the core mechanism: treating the unknown underlying probability as a random variable and averaging over all its possible values. By tackling a scenario with a uniform prior distribution, we can calculate a simple, unconditional probability and build intuition for how exchangeable sequences behave [@problem_id:1355478].", "problem": "Consider a sequence of experiments, where each experiment can result in either a success (represented by 1) or a failure (represented by 0). Let $X_1, X_2, X_3, \\dots$ be the sequence of random variables representing the outcomes of these experiments. This sequence is known to be *exchangeable*, which means that the joint probability distribution of any finite subset of these variables is unchanged by reordering them. For example, the probability of observing the sequence (1, 0, 1) is the same as observing (1, 1, 0) or (0, 1, 1).\n\nA key result in probability theory, de Finetti's theorem, implies that for such an infinite exchangeable sequence of binary outcomes, there exists a random variable $\\Theta$ taking values in $[0, 1]$ such that, conditional on $\\Theta = \\theta$, the random variables $X_1, X_2, \\dots$ are independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials with a probability of success given by $P(X_i = 1 | \\Theta = \\theta) = \\theta$.\n\nSuppose that our initial uncertainty about the underlying success rate of the process is modeled by treating the parameter $\\Theta$ as a random variable drawn from a continuous uniform distribution on the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nBased on this model, calculate the unconditional probability that the first experiment results in a success, $P(X_1 = 1)$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the unconditional probability $P(X_1 = 1)$. We are given information about the conditional probability of $X_1=1$ given the parameter $\\Theta$, and we are also given the probability distribution of $\\Theta$. This situation calls for the use of the Law of Total Probability for continuous random variables.\n\nLet $f_{\\Theta}(\\theta)$ be the probability density function (PDF) of the random variable $\\Theta$. The Law of Total Probability states that we can find the unconditional probability of an event by integrating the conditional probability of that event over all possible values of the conditioning variable, weighted by the PDF of that variable. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$P(X_1 = 1) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(X_1 = 1 | \\Theta = \\theta) f_{\\Theta}(\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\n\nWe are given two key pieces of information:\n1. The conditional probability of success: $P(X_1 = 1 | \\Theta = \\theta) = \\theta$.\n2. The distribution of the parameter $\\Theta$: $\\Theta$ follows a continuous uniform distribution on the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nFor a uniform distribution on $[a, b]$, the PDF is given by $f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a}$ for $x \\in [a, b]$, and $f(x)=0$ otherwise. In our case, with the interval $[0, 1]$, the PDF of $\\Theta$ is:\n$$f_{\\Theta}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1-0} = 1 \\quad \\text{for } \\theta \\in [0, 1]$$\nAnd $f_{\\Theta}(\\theta) = 0$ for $\\theta$ outside this interval.\n\nNow we can substitute these into the integral from the Law of Total Probability. Since $f_{\\Theta}(\\theta)$ is zero outside the interval $[0, 1]$, the limits of integration can be changed from $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ to $(0, 1)$:\n$$P(X_1 = 1) = \\int_{0}^{1} P(X_1 = 1 | \\Theta = \\theta) f_{\\Theta}(\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\n\nSubstituting the given expressions for the conditional probability and the PDF:\n$$P(X_1 = 1) = \\int_{0}^{1} (\\theta) \\cdot (1) \\, d\\theta$$\n$$P(X_1 = 1) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\theta \\, d\\theta$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this simple integral. The antiderivative of $\\theta$ with respect to $\\theta$ is $\\frac{\\theta^2}{2}$. We evaluate this from 0 to 1:\n$$P(X_1 = 1) = \\left[ \\frac{\\theta^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{1}$$\n$$P(X_1 = 1) = \\frac{1^2}{2} - \\frac{0^2}{2}$$\n$$P(X_1 = 1) = \\frac{1}{2} - 0$$\n$$P(X_1 = 1) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThus, the unconditional probability that the first experiment is a success is $\\frac{1}{2}$. This result means that with no prior observations, and with a completely non-informative (uniform) prior on the success probability $\\theta$, success and failure are equally likely.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "1355478"}, {"introduction": "A key application of de Finetti's theorem is in learning from observations.
