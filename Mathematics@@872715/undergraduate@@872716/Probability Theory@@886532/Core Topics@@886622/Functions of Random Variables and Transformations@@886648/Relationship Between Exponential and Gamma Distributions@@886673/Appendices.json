This means the shape parameter is an integer, $k=3$.\nApplying the theorem above, we can construct $Y$ by summing three independent random variables, each drawn from an $\\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$ distribution.\nSo, if we let $X_1, X_2, X_3$ be three independent draws from $\\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$, their sum $Y = X_1 + X_2 + X_3$ will be a random draw from $\\text{Gamma}(3, \\lambda)$.\n\nThe computational function `generate_exp(lambda)` provides exactly what we need: a single draw from an $\\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$ distribution.

Call the function three times to get three values, $X_1, X_2, X_3$. The result is their sum: $Y = X_1 + X_2 + X_3$. This matches our derived procedure.\n\nB. Call the function three times to get three values, $X_1, X_2, X_3$. The result is their average: $Y = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3}{3}$. This procedure generates the sample mean of three exponential random variables. The distribution of the sample mean is not a $\\text{Gamma}(3, \\lambda)$ distribution. The mean of this new variable would be $E[\\frac{X_1+X_2+X_3}{3}] = \\frac{1}{3}(E[X_1]+E[X_2]+E[X_3]) = \\frac{1}{3}(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}+\\frac{1}{\\lambda}+\\frac{1}{\\lambda}) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$, whereas the mean of a $\\text{Gamma}(3, \\lambda)$ is $\\frac{3}{\\lambda}$. This option is incorrect.\n\nC. Call the function once with a modified parameter, `generate_exp(3 * lambda)`. This generates a single random variable from an $\\text{Exp}(3\\lambda)$ distribution. An $\\text{Exp}(3\\lambda)$ distribution is equivalent to a $\\text{Gamma}(1, 3\\lambda)$ distribution, which is not the same as a $\\text{Gamma}(3, \\lambda)$ distribution. This option is incorrect.\n\nD. Call the function once to get a value, $X_1$. The result is three times this value: $Y = 3 \\times X_1$. This is a scaling of a single exponential random variable. If $X_1 \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$, then the random variable $Y = cX_1$ follows an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda/c$. In our case, $Y = 3X_1$ would follow an $\\text{Exp}(\\lambda/3)$ distribution. An $\\text{Exp}(\\lambda/3)$ distribution is equivalent to a $\\text{Gamma}(1, \\lambda/3)$ distribution, which is not $\\text{Gamma}(3, \\lambda)$. This option is incorrect.\n\nE. Call the function three times to get three values, $X_1, X_2, X_3$. The result is their product: $Y = X_1 \\times X_2 \\times X_3$. The distribution of the product of random variables is generally complex and is not a Gamma distribution in this case.
