The dimensionless output signal from sensor A is modeled as a random variable $X$, and the output from sensor B is modeled as a random variable $Y$. To understand the system's combined behavior, two new signals are constructed: a sum signal, $S = X+Y$, and a difference signal, $D = X-Y$. After extensive testing, the variance of the sum signal is measured to be $\\text{Var}(S) = 10$, and the variance of the difference signal is measured to be $\\text{Var}(D) = 2$.
