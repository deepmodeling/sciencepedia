All definitions are standard.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient information to construct the sections, find the transition function, and compute the winding number. The result is a uniquely determined integer.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise mathematical language.\n\nThe problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\n#### 2.1: Construct the Local Sections $s_N$ and $s_S$\nLet a point on $S^2$ be $p=(x_1, x_2, x_3)$. The fiber $h^{-1}(p)$ consists of points $(z_0, z_1) \\in S^3$ satisfying:\n$x_1+ix_2 = 2 z_0\\overline{z_1}$ and $x_3 = |z_0|^2 - |z_1|^2$.\nCombined with $|z_0|^2+|z_1|^2=1$, we find $|z_0|^2 = \\frac{1+x_3}{2}$ and $|z_1|^2 = \\frac{1-x_3}{2}$.\n\nFor the section $s_N: U_N \\to S^3$, the domain is $S^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0,1)\\}$. The non-excluded pole is the South Pole $(0,0,-1)$. The fiber over the South Pole is characterized by $|z_0|^2=0$, i.e., $z_0=0$. The problem asks for the component corresponding to the non-excluded pole to be real and positive. This is ambiguous. A working interpretation is to select the component that *does not* vanish at the non-excluded pole and set its phase to zero.\nAt the South Pole ($x_3=-1$), $|z_1|^2=1$, so $z_1 \\neq 0$. Thus, for $s_N$, we impose the condition that $z_1$ is real and positive.\nSince $|z_1|^2 = \\frac{1-x_3}{2}$, this means $z_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-x_3}{2}}$. This is well-defined and positive on $U_N$ where $x_3 < 1$.\nFrom $x_1+ix_2 = 2z_0\\overline{z_1}$, we solve for $z_0$: $z_0 = \\frac{x_1+ix_2}{2z_1} = \\frac{x_1+ix_2}{\\sqrt{2(1-x_3)}}$.\nSo, $s_N(p) = \\left(\\frac{x_1+ix_2}{\\sqrt{2(1-x_3)}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{1-x_3}{2}}\\right)$.\n\nFor the section $s_S: U_S \\to S^3$, the domain is $S^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0,-1)\\}$. The non-excluded pole is the North Pole $(0,0,1)$. At the North Pole ($x_3=1$), $|z_0|^2=1$, so $z_0 \\neq 0$. For $s_S$, we impose the condition that $z_0$ is real and positive.\nSince $|z_0|^2 = \\frac{1+x_3}{2}$, this means $z_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1+x_3}{2}}$. This is well-defined and positive on $U_S$ where $x_3 > -1$.\nFrom $x_1-ix_2 = 2\\overline{z_0}z_1$, and since $z_0$ is real, we solve for $z_1$: $z_1 = \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{2z_0} = \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{\\sqrt{2(1+x_3)}}$.\nSo, $s_S(p) = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x_3}{2}}, \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{\\sqrt{2(1+x_3)}}\\right)$.\n\n#### 2.2: Compute the Transition Function $g_{SN}$\nThe transition function $g_{SN}(p)$ is defined by $s_S(p) = s_N(p) \\cdot g_{SN}(p)$ for $p \\in U_N \\cap U_S$. With the given action, this becomes:\n$(z_0^S, z_1^S) = (z_0^N g_{SN}(p), z_1^N g_{SN}(p))$.\nWe can solve for $g_{SN}(p)$ using the first components: $g_{SN}(p) = \\frac{z_0^S}{z_0^N}$.\n$$g_{SN}(p) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x_3}{2}}}{\\frac{x_1+ix_2}{\\sqrt{2(1-x_3)}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x_3}{2}} \\sqrt{2(1-x_3)}}{x_1+ix_2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-x_3^2}}{x_1+ix_2}$$\nSince $x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=1$ on $S^2$, we have $\\sqrt{1-x_3^2} = \\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2} = |x_1+ix_2|$.\n$$g_{SN}(p) = \\frac{|x_1+ix_2|}{x_1+ix_2} = \\left(\\frac{x_1+ix_2}{|x_1+ix_2|}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{\\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}$$\n\n#### 2.3: Express $g_{SN}$ on the Equator\nWe need to find the relationship between the parameter $\\theta$ from $v(\\theta)=\\exp(i\\theta)$ and the Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ of the corresponding point on the equator.\nThe problem states $v=1/u$. This relation holds for the following standard stereographic projections:\n- From the North Pole: $u = \\frac{x_1+ix_2}{1-x_3}$.\n- From the South Pole, with conjugation: $v = \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{1+x_3}$.\nLet's verify this: $uv = \\frac{x_1+ix_2}{1-x_3} \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{1+x_3} = \\frac{x_1^2+x_2^2}{1-x_3^2} = \\frac{1-x_3^2}{1-x_3^2} = 1$. Thus $v=1/u$.\n\nWe need the inverse transformation from the $v$-coordinate to Cartesian coordinates.\nFrom $v = \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{1+x_3}$, we have $|v|^2 = \\frac{x_1^2+x_2^2}{(1+x_3)^2} = \\frac{1-x_3^2}{(1+x_3)^2} = \\frac{1-x_3}{1+x_3}$.\nSolving for $x_3$: $|v|^2(1+x_3) = 1-x_3 \\implies x_3(|v|^2+1) = 1-|v|^2 \\implies x_3 = \\frac{1-|v|^2}{1+|v|^2}$.\nAnd $x_1-ix_2 = v(1+x_3) = v\\left(1 + \\frac{1-|v|^2}{1+|v|^2}\\right) = v\\left(\\frac{1+|v|^2+1-|v|^2}{1+|v|^2}\\right) = \\frac{2v}{1+|v|^2}$.\n\nThe equator is parameterized by $v(\\theta) = \\exp(i\\theta)$, so $|v|=1$.\nFor these points:\n$x_3 = \\frac{1-|\\exp(i\\theta)|^2}{1+|\\exp(i\\theta)|^2} = \\frac{1-1}{1+1} = 0$.\n$x_1-ix_2 = \\frac{2\\exp(i\\theta)}{1+|\\exp(i\\theta)|^2} = \\frac{2\\exp(i\\theta)}{2} = \\exp(i\\theta)$.\nSo, for a point on the equator parameterized by $\\theta$, we have $x_1-ix_2 = \\exp(i\\theta)$. This gives $x_1 = \\cos(\\theta)$ and $x_2 = -\\sin(\\theta)$.\n\nNow we evaluate the transition function $g_{SN}$ along this parameterized equator. Let's denote $g_{SN}(\\theta) = g_{SN}(p(\\theta))$.\nOn the equator, $x_3=0$, so $\\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}=1$.\n$$g_{SN}(\\theta) = x_1-ix_2 = \\exp(i\\theta)$$\n\n#### 2.4: Compute the Winding Number\nThe winding number is given by the integral formula:\n$$\\deg(g_{SN})=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} g_{SN}(\\theta)^{-1}\\,\\frac{d}{d\\theta}g_{SN}(\\theta)\\,d\\theta$$\nWe have $g_{SN}(\\theta) = \\exp(i\\theta)$.\nIts inverse is $g_{SN}(\\theta)^{-1} = \\exp(-i\\theta)$.\nIts derivative is $\\frac{d}{d\\theta}g_{SN}(\\theta) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\exp(i\\theta) = i\\exp(i\\theta)$.\nThe term in the integral is:\n$$g_{SN}(\\theta)^{-1}\\,\\frac{d}{d\\theta}g_{SN}(\\theta) = \\exp(-i\\theta) \\cdot (i\\exp(i\\theta)) = i$$\nNow we compute the integral:\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} i\\,d\\theta = i[\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = i(2\\pi - 0) = 2\\pi i$$\nFinally, the winding number is:\n$$\\deg(g_{SN}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} (2\\pi i) = 1$$\nThe winding number is $1$.

The setup is mathematically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core principle for classifying principal $G$-bundles over the sphere $S^n$ is through the clutching construction. A principal $G$-bundle over $S^n$ is determined, up to isomorphism, by the homotopy class of its transition function over the equator $S^{n-1}$. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of principal $G$-bundles over $S^n$ and elements of the homotopy group $\\pi_{n-1}(G)$. The trivial bundle $S^n \\times G$ corresponds to the identity element of $\\pi_{n-1}(G)$, which is the homotopy class of the constant map.\n\nIn this problem, the base space is $X = S^2$. Therefore, principal bundles are classified by the fundamental group of the structure group.\n\nFirst, consider the original principal $\\mathrm{U}(1)$-bundle $P \\to S^2$. The structure group is $G_1 = \\mathrm{U}(1)$, the unitary group of degree $1$. Topologically, $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ is the circle $S^1$. The classification of principal $\\mathrm{U}(1)$-bundles over $S^2$ is given by $\\pi_1(\\mathrm{U}(1)) = \\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The integer corresponding to a bundle is its first Chern number, the integral of its first Chern class $c_1$ over $S^2$.\nThe problem states that $P$ is the Hopf fibration, for which $c_1(P)$ corresponds to the integer $1$. This means that in the clutching construction, the transition map for $P$, let's call it $g_P : S^1 \\to \\mathrm{U}(1)$, is a map of degree $1$. The homotopy class $[g_P]$ is a generator of $\\pi_1(\\mathrm{U}(1))$. The fact that $[g_P]$ is not the identity element confirms that $P$ is a nontrivial bundle.\n\nNext, we consider the new principal $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$-bundle $Q = P \\times_{\\mathrm{U}(1)} \\mathrm{SU}(2) \\to S^2$. This bundle is formed by extending the structure group of $P$ from $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ to $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ via the homomorphism $\\iota : \\mathrm{U}(1) \\hookrightarrow \\mathrm{SU}(2)$. In the clutching construction, if the transition function for $P$ is $g_P$, the transition function for $Q$ is given by the composition $g_Q = \\iota \\circ g_P : S^1 \\to \\mathrm{SU}(2)$.\n\nTo determine if $Q$ is trivial, we must determine if its clutching map $g_Q$ is null-homotopic. That is, we must check if its homotopy class $[g_Q]$ is the identity element in the group $\\pi_1(\\mathrm{SU}(2))$. The class $[g_Q]$ is the image of $[g_P]$ under the homomorphism of fundamental groups induced by $\\iota$:\n$$\n\\iota_* : \\pi_1(\\mathrm{U}(1)) \\longrightarrow \\pi_1(\\mathrm{SU}(2))\n$$\nThe special unitary group $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ consists of $2 \\times 2$ unitary matrices with determinant $1$.

Therefore, $[g_Q] = [\\iota \\circ g_P] = \\iota_*([g_P]) = e$.\n\nThis means the clutching map $g_Q$ is null-homotopic. A principal bundle whose clutching map is null-homotopic is, by definition, the trivial bundle. Consequently, the bundle $Q$ is isomorphic to the trivial bundle $S^2 \\times \\mathrm{SU}(2)$.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. $Q$ is trivial because $\\pi_{1}(\\mathrm{SU}(2)) = 0$, so for the Hopf bundle the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$-clutching map $\\iota \\circ g_{1} : S^{1} \\to \\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is null-homotopic and the clutching construction yields $S^{2} \\times \\mathrm{SU}(2)$.**\n\nThis statement asserts that $Q$ is trivial. It correctly identifies the reason: the fundamental group of the structure group $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is trivial ($\\pi_{1}(\\mathrm{SU}(2)) = 0$, where $0$ conventionally denotes the trivial group in this context). Because $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is simply connected, any loop in it, including the new clutching map $\\iota \\circ g_1$ (where $g_1$ is the clutching map for the original bundle), is contractible to a point (null-homotopic). This correctly implies that the resulting bundle $Q$ is the trivial one, $S^2 \\times \\mathrm{SU}(2)$. The reasoning is sound and aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $Q$ is nontrivial, classified by the second Chern class $c_{2}(Q) \\in H^{4}(S^{2}; \\mathbb{Z})$ with $c_{2}(Q) = 1$, since extending the structure group transfers $c_{1}(P)$ to $c_{2}(Q)$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, as we have proven, $Q$ is trivial. A trivial bundle has all its characteristic classes equal to zero, so $c_2(Q)$ must be $0$. Second, characteristic classes reside in the cohomology of the base manifold. The second Chern class $c_2(Q)$ is an element of $H^4(S^2; \\mathbb{Z})$. However, for any $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, its cohomology group $H^k(M; G)$ is trivial for $k > n$. Since $S^2$ is $2$-dimensional, $H^4(S^2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. It is therefore impossible for $c_2(Q)$ to be $1$; it must be $0$. The claim that $c_1$ is \"transferred\" to $c_2$ is a misunderstanding of the behavior of characteristic classes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $Q$ is trivial if and only if the degree $k$ of the original $\\mathrm{U}(1)$-bundle is even; for odd $k$ it remains nontrivial because the inclusion $\\iota$ doubles the winding number of the $\\mathrm{U}(1)$-clutching map.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. As established, the triviality of $Q$ stems from $\\pi_1(\\mathrm{SU}(2))$ being the trivial group. This means that *any* principal $\\mathrm{U}(1)$-bundle over $S^2$, regardless of its degree $k$, becomes trivial when its structure group is extended to $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ via the map $\\iota$. The homotopy class of the resulting clutching map $\\iota \\circ g_k$ will always be the identity element in $\\pi_1(\\mathrm{SU}(2))$, because this group contains only one element. The condition on the parity of $k$ is therefore irrelevant. The notion of \"doubling the winding number\" is not well-defined for a map into a simply connected space like $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The associated bundle functor $P \\mapsto P \\times_{\\mathrm{U}(1)} \\mathrm{SU}(2)$ preserves nontriviality of principal bundles, so $Q$ is nontrivial whenever $P$ is nontrivial.**\n\nThis statement makes a general claim that is demonstrably false. Our specific problem provides a counterexample. The original bundle $P$ is the nontrivial Hopf bundle ($c_1(P)=1$), but the resulting bundle $Q$ is trivial. Thus, the functor of extending the structure group does not preserve nontriviality in this case. Whether nontriviality is preserved depends on the injectivity of the induced map on the relevant homotopy groups (here, $\\iota_* : \\pi_1(\\mathrm{U}(1)) \\to \\pi_1(\\mathrm{SU}(2))$). Since this map is the zero map, it is maximally non-injective, and all bundles become trivial under this extension.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3059366"}]}
