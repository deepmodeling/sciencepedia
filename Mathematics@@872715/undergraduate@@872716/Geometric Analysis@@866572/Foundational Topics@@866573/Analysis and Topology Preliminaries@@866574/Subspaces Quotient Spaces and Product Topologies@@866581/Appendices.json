This analysis will proceed by first understanding the geometric and topological structure of the sets involved, and then applying the fundamental definitions of connectedness and subspace topology.\n\nThe ambient space is $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with its standard topology, which is equivalent to the product topology of $\\mathbb{R}$ with its standard topology. The problem defines three circles, $C_a$, for $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$:\n$$C_a := \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : (x-a)^2 + y^2 = a^2\\}$$\nThis equation describes a circle with center $(a,0)$ and radius $a$.\n\nLet us identify the point $p := (0,0)$. For any $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, we can check if $p$ lies on $C_a$ by substituting its coordinates into the equation:\n$$(0-a)^2 + 0^2 = (-a)^2 = a^2$$\nThis confirms that the point $p=(0,0)$ lies on all three circles $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$.\n\nNext, let us find all points of intersection between these circles. An intersection point $(x,y)$ must satisfy the equation of each circle. The equation $(x-a)^2 + y^2 = a^2$ can be expanded to $x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 = a^2$, which simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 = 2ax$.\nIf a point $(x,y)$ lies on $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$, it must satisfy:\n$1.$ $x^2 + y^2 = 2x$\n$2.$ $x^2 + y^2 = 4x$\n$3.$ $x^2 + y^2 = 6x$\nFrom these equations, we must have $2x = 4x = 6x$. This implies $2x = 0$, so $x=0$. Substituting $x=0$ into the first equation gives $0^2 + y^2 = 2(0)$, which implies $y^2=0$, so $y=0$. Thus, the sole point of intersection for all three circles is $p=(0,0)$. A similar argument shows that any pair of distinct circles $C_i$ and $C_j$ (for $i, j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, $i \\neq j$) also intersect only at the point $p=(0,0)$.\n\nThe space $S$ is defined as the union of these three circles: $S := C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3$.\nThe space of interest, $Y$, is defined as $S$ with the point $p$ removed:\n$$Y := S \\setminus \\{p\\} = (C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3) \\setminus \\{p\\}$$\nUsing properties of set difference, this can be written as:\n$$Y = (C_1 \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\cup (C_2 \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\cup (C_3 \\setminus \\{p\\})$$\nLet us define $C'_a := C_a \\setminus \\{p\\}$ for $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Then $Y = C'_1 \\cup C'_2 \\cup C'_3$. Since the only intersection point of any pair of circles is $p$, the sets $C'_1$, $C'_2$, and $C'_3$ are pairwise disjoint.\n\nThe connected components of a topological space are its maximal connected subsets. These components form a partition of the space. To find the number of connected components of $Y$, we will analyze the properties of the sets $C'_a$.\n\nFirst, we establish that each set $C'_a$ is a connected space with the subspace topology inherited from $Y$ (which itself is inherited from $\\mathbb{R}^2$). A circle $C_a$ is homeomorphic to the unit circle $S^1$ and is therefore path-connected, which implies it is connected. The set $C'_a = C_a \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is a circle with a single point removed. Such a space is homeomorphic to an open interval, for instance $(0, 2\\pi)$. Since an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ is path-connected, it is connected. Thus, $C'_1$, $C'_2$, and $C'_3$ are all connected sets.\n\nNow we must determine if these sets are connected to each other within the space $Y$. The connected components of $Y$ are the equivalence classes of the relation where $x \\sim y$ if there exists a connected subset of $Y$ containing both $x$ and $y$. Since $C'_1$, $C'_2$, and $C'_3$ are disjoint, if we can show that they are also separated in the topology of $Y$, they must be the connected components. A partition of a space into non-empty connected subsets which are also open in the space is precisely the partition into connected components. We will show that each $C'_a$ is both open and closed in $Y$ (clopen).\n\nLet's consider the set $C'_1$. To show it is closed in $Y$, we must show it can be written as the intersection of $Y$ with a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nEach circle $C_a$ is the zero set of a continuous function $f_a(x,y) = (x-a)^2 + y^2 - a^2$, so each $C_a$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nLet's consider the set $C_1$, which is closed in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Its intersection with $Y$ is:\n$$C_1 \\cap Y = C_1 \\cap (S \\setminus \\{p\\}) = (C_1 \\cap S) \\setminus \\{p\\}$$\nSince $C_1 \\subset S$, the intersection $C_1 \\cap S$ is simply $C_1$. So,\n$$C_1 \\cap Y = C_1 \\setminus \\{p\\} = C'_1$$\nBy the definition of the subspace topology, since $C_1$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, $C'_1$ is a closed set in $Y$.\nThe same reasoning applies to $C'_2$ and $C'_3$. We take the closed sets $C_2$ and $C_3$ from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and intersect them with $Y$:\n$$C_2 \\cap Y = C_2 \\setminus \\{p\\} = C'_2$$\n$$C_3 \\cap Y = C_3 \\setminus \\{p\\} = C'_3$$\nTherefore, $C'_1$, $C'_2$, and $C'_3$ are all closed sets in the topology of $Y$.\n\nNext, we show that each $C'_a$ is also open in $Y$. A set is open if and only if its complement is closed.\nThe complement of $C'_1$ in $Y$ is $Y \\setminus C'_1$. Since $Y = C'_1 \\cup C'_2 \\cup C'_3$ and the sets are disjoint, we have:\n$$Y \\setminus C'_1 = C'_2 \\cup C'_3$$\nWe have already shown that $C'_2$ and $C'_3$ are closed sets in $Y$. The finite union of closed sets is a closed set. Therefore, $C'_2 \\cup C'_3$ is closed in $Y$.\nSince the complement of $C'_1$ is closed in $Y$, $C'_1$ must be open in $Y$.\nBy identical logic, the complement of $C'_2$ is $C'_1 \\cup C'_3$, which is a union of two closed sets and thus closed. So $C'_2$ is open in $Y$.\nAnd the complement of $C'_3$ is $C'_1 \\cup C'_2$, which is closed, so $C'_3$ is open in $Y$.\n\nIn summary, we have shown:\n$1.$ $Y = C'_1 \\cup C'_2 \\cup C'_3$.\n$2.$ The sets $C'_1$, $C'_2$, $C'_3$ are non-empty and pairwise disjoint.\n$3.$ Each set $C'_a$ is connected.\n$4.$ Each set $C'_a$ is open in $Y$.\n\nThis constitutes a partition of $Y$ into non-empty, disjoint, connected, open sets. By the definition of connected components, these sets must be the connected components of $Y$.\nThe connected components of $Y$ are $C'_1$, $C'_2$, and $C'_3$.\nThe number of connected components is therefore $3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "3064222"}, {"introduction": "Quotient spaces provide a powerful method for constructing complex topological objects, such as surfaces, by 'gluing' together simpler pieces.

The space $X$ is the quotient space $P/\\sim$, where $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation that identifies pairs of edges on the boundary $\\partial P$. The polygon $P$, as a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (which has the product topology of $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$), is homeomorphic to a closed disk. The space $X$ is endowed with the quotient topology.\n\nTo find the Euler characteristic, we will view $X$ as a cell complex. The construction of $X$ from $P$ provides a natural cell decomposition. The Euler characteristic is then given by the formula:\n$$\n\\chi(X) = V - E + F\n$$\nwhere $F$ is the number of $2$-cells (faces), $E$ is the number of $1$-cells (edges), and $V$ is the number of $0$-cells (vertices) in the cell decomposition of $X$.\n\n1.  **Faces (F):** The equivalence relation $\\sim$ is defined only on the boundary $\\partial P$. The interior of the polygon, $\\text{int}(P)$, is an open disk and is not affected by the identifications. Under the quotient map $\\pi: P \\to X$, the interior of $P$ maps to a single open $2$-cell in $X$. Therefore, the number of faces is $F=1$.\n\n2.  **Edges (E):** The boundary of the polygon $P$ consists of $12$ edges. The labeling scheme given is:\n    $$\n    a_1, b_1, a_1^{-1}, b_1^{-1}, a_2, b_2, a_2^{-1}, b_2^{-1}, a_3, b_3, a_3^{-1}, b_3^{-1}\n    $$\n    The equivalence relation $\\sim$ identifies the edge labeled $x$ with the edge labeled $x^{-1}$.

Therefore, the number of edges in $X$ is $E = 12/2 = 6$.\n\n3.  **Vertices (V):** We must determine how the $12$ vertices of the polygon $P$, denoted $v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_{11}$ in counterclockwise order, are identified under the relation $\\sim$. Let the directed edge from $v_i$ to $v_{i+1}$ (indices modulo $12$) be $e_i$. The labels are assigned cyclically to these edges:\n    - $e_0: v_0 \\to v_1$ is labeled $a_1$.\n    - $e_1: v_1 \\to v_2$ is labeled $b_1$.\n    - $e_2: v_2 \\to v_3$ is labeled $a_1^{-1}$.\n    - $e_3: v_3 \\to v_4$ is labeled $b_1^{-1}$.\n    - $e_4: v_4 \\to v_5$ is labeled $a_2$.\n    - $e_5: v_5 \\to v_6$ is labeled $b_2$.\n    - $e_6: v_6 \\to v_7$ is labeled $a_2^{-1}$.\n    - $e_7: v_7 \\to v_8$ is labeled $b_2^{-1}$.\n    - $e_8: v_8 \\to v_9$ is labeled $a_3$.\n    - $e_9: v_9 \\to v_{10}$ is labeled $b_3$.\n    - $e_{10}: v_{10} \\to v_{11}$ is labeled $a_3^{-1}$.\n    - $e_{11}: v_{11} \\to v_0$ is labeled $b_3^{-1}$.\n\n    The identification rule states that the \"initial endpoint along the $x$ arrow is identified with the terminal endpoint along the $x^{-1}$ arrow, and vice versa.\" For an edge $e_i: v_i \\to v_{i+1}$ labeled $x$, the arrow direction agrees with the boundary traversal, so its initial point is $v_i$ and terminal is $v_{i+1}$. For an edge $e_j: v_j \\to v_{j+1}$ labeled $x^{-1}$, the arrow is reversed relative to the label, so the $x^{-1}$ arrow runs from $v_{j+1}$ to $v_j$. The \"initial endpoint along the $x$ arrow\" for the $x$-labeled edge is $v_i$. The \"terminal endpoint along the $x^{-1}$ arrow\" for the $x^{-1}$-labeled edge is $v_j$. Thus, the identification is $v_i \\sim v_j$. The other part of the rule gives $v_{i+1} \\sim v_{j+1}$.\n    The common interpretation for gluing $a$ to $a^{-1}$ is that the head of one arrow is glued to the head of the other, and tail to tail. The edge $e_0: v_0 \\to v_1$ is $a_1$. The edge $e_2: v_2 \\to v_3$ is labeled $a_1^{-1}$, meaning the conceptual $a_1$ arrow runs from $v_3$ to $v_2$. Thus, we identify $v_0 \\sim v_3$ (tails of $a_1$) and $v_1 \\sim v_2$ (heads of $a_1$).\n\n    Applying this rule to our edge pairs:\n    - **Pair $a_1, a_1^{-1}$**: The edge $e_0: v_0 \\to v_1$ is labeled $a_1$.

The edge $e_3: v_3 \\to v_4$ is labeled $b_1^{-1}$. The identification is $v_1 \\sim v_4$ and $v_2 \\sim v_3$.\n    - **Pair $a_2, a_2^{-1}$**: The edge $e_4: v_4 \\to v_5$ is labeled $a_2$. The edge $e_6: v_6 \\to v_7$ is labeled $a_2^{-1}$. The identification is $v_4 \\sim v_7$ and $v_5 \\sim v_6$.\n    - **Pair $b_2, b_2^{-1}$**: The edge $e_5: v_5 \\to v_6$ is labeled $b_2$. The edge $e_7: v_7 \\to v_8$ is labeled $b_2^{-1}$. The identification is $v_5 \\sim v_8$ and $v_6 \\sim v_7$.\n    - **Pair $a_3, a_3^{-1}$**: The edge $e_8: v_8 \\to v_9$ is labeled $a_3$. The edge $e_{10}: v_{10} \\to v_{11}$ is labeled $a_3^{-1}$. The identification is $v_8 \\sim v_{11}$ and $v_9 \\sim v_{10}$.\n    - **Pair $b_3, b_3^{-1}$**: The edge $e_9: v_9 \\to v_{10}$ is labeled $b_3$. The edge $e_{11}: v_{11} \\to v_0$ is labeled $b_3^{-1}$. The identification is $v_9 \\sim v_0$ and $v_{10} \\sim v_{11}$.\n\n    Now, we trace the equivalence classes generated by these relations. Let's start with the equivalence class of $v_0$, denoted $[v_0]$.\n    - $v_0 \\sim v_3$ (from $a_1/a_1^{-1}$)\n    - $v_3 \\sim v_2$ (from $b_1/b_1^{-1}$)\n    - $v_2 \\sim v_1$ (from $a_1/a_1^{-1}$)\n    - $v_1 \\sim v_4$ (from $b_1/b_1^{-1}$)\n    - $v_4 \\sim v_7$ (from $a_2/a_2^{-1}$)\n    - $v_7 \\sim v_6$ (from $b_2/b_2^{-1}$)\n    - $v_6 \\sim v_5$ (from $a_2/a_2^{-1}$)\n    - $v_5 \\sim v_8$ (from $b_2/b_2^{-1}$)\n    - $v_8 \\sim v_{11}$ (from $a_3/a_3^{-1}$)\n    - $v_{11} \\sim v_{10}$ (from $b_3/b_3^{-1}$)\n    - $v_{10} \\sim v_9$ (from $a_3/a_3^{-1}$)\n    - $v_9 \\sim v_0$ (from $b_3/b_3^{-1}$)\n    This chain of equivalences $v_0 \\sim v_3 \\sim v_2 \\sim v_1 \\sim v_4 \\sim v_7 \\sim v_6 \\sim v_5 \\sim v_8 \\sim v_{11} \\sim v_{10} \\sim v_9 \\sim v_0$ connects all $12$ vertices. Thus, all vertices of the polygon are identified to a single point in the quotient space $X$.\n    The number of vertices in $X$ is $V=1$.\n\n4.  **Euler Characteristic Calculation:**\n    We substitute the number of vertices, edges, and faces into the Euler characteristic formula:\n    $$\n    \\chi(X) = V - E + F = 1 - 6 + 1 = -4\n    $$\n\nThis result is consistent with the classification of surfaces. The boundary word of the polygon is $a_1b_1a_1^{-1}b_1^{-1}a_2b_2a_2^{-1}b_2^{-1}a_3b_3a_3^{-1}b_3^{-1}$. This corresponds to the connected sum of three tori ($T^2 \\# T^2 \\# T^2$), which is an orientable surface of genus $g=3$. The Euler characteristic for such a surface is given by $\\chi = 2 - 2g$.
