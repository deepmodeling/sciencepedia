The product space $X\\times Y$ is equipped with the norm $\\|(x,y)\\| = \\|x\\|_{X}+\\|y\\|_{Y}$.\n\n**(a) Proof that $(X\\times Y,\\|\\cdot\\|)$ is a Banach space.**\n\nFirst, we verify that $(X\\times Y,\\|\\cdot\\|)$ is a normed vector space. The space $X\\times Y$ is a vector space under the component-wise operations $(\\alpha(x_1, y_1) + \\beta(x_2, y_2)) = (\\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2, \\alpha y_1 + \\beta y_2)$. The defined function $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is a norm:\n1.  **Positive definiteness**: For any $(x,y)\\in X\\times Y$, $\\|(x,y)\\| = \\|x\\|_{X}+\\|y\\|_{Y} \\geq 0$ since norms are non-negative. Furthermore, $\\|(x,y)\\| = 0$ if and only if $\\|x\\|_{X}=0$ and $\\|y\\|_{Y}=0$, which due to the definiteness of the norms on $X$ and $Y$, is equivalent to $x=0_X$ and $y=0_Y$. Thus, $\\|(x,y)\\| = 0$ if and only if $(x,y)=(0_X, 0_Y)$.\n2.  **Homogeneity**: For any scalar $\\alpha$ and $(x,y)\\in X\\times Y$, $\\|\\alpha(x,y)\\| = \\|(\\alpha x, \\alpha y)\\| = \\|\\alpha x\\|_{X}+\\|\\alpha y\\|_{Y} = |\\alpha|\\|x\\|_{X}+|\\alpha|\\|y\\|_{Y} = |\\alpha|(\\|x\\|_{X}+\\|y\\|_{Y}) = |\\alpha|\\|(x,y)\\|$.\n3.  **Triangle inequality**: For any $(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2)\\in X\\times Y$,\n    $$\n    \\|(x_1,y_1)+(x_2,y_2)\\| = \\|(x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2)\\| = \\|x_1+x_2\\|_{X}+\\|y_1+y_2\\|_{Y}.\n    $$\n    By the triangle inequality on $X$ and $Y$,\n    $$\n    \\|x_1+x_2\\|_{X}+\\|y_1+y_2\\|_{Y} \\leq (\\|x_1\\|_{X}+\\|x_2\\|_{X}) + (\\|y_1\\|_{Y}+\\|y_2\\|_{Y}) = (\\|x_1\\|_{X}+\\|y_1\\|_{Y}) + (\\|x_2\\|_{X}+\\|y_2\\|_{Y}) = \\|(x_1,y_1)\\| + \\|(x_2,y_2)\\|.\n    $$\nThus, $(X\\times Y,\\|\\cdot\\|)$ is a normed vector space.\n\nTo prove it is a Banach space, we must show it is complete. Let $\\{(x_n, y_n)\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $X\\times Y$. By the definition of a Cauchy sequence, for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n > N$,\n$$\n\\|(x_m, y_m)-(x_n, y_n)\\|  \\epsilon.\n$$\nUsing the definition of the norm on $X\\times Y$, this becomes\n$$\n\\|(x_m-x_n, y_m-y_n)\\| = \\|x_m-x_n\\|_{X} + \\|y_m-y_n\\|_{Y}  \\epsilon.\n$$\nSince both $\\|x_m-x_n\\|_{X}$ and $\\|y_m-y_n\\|_{Y}$ are non-negative, this implies that for all $m,n>N$,\n$$\n\\|x_m-x_n\\|_{X}  \\epsilon \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\|y_m-y_n\\|_{Y}  \\epsilon.\n$$\nThis means that $\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(X,\\|\\cdot\\|_{X})$ and $\\{y_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(Y,\\|\\cdot\\|_{Y})$.\n\nSince $X$ and $Y$ are Banach spaces, they are complete. Therefore, the Cauchy sequences $\\{x_n\\}$ and $\\{y_n\\}$ must converge to limits within their respective spaces. Let\n$$\nx = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n \\in X \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y_n \\in Y.\n$$\nWe now show that the sequence $\\{(x_n, y_n)\\}$ converges to the element $(x,y) \\in X\\times Y$. We examine the norm of the difference:\n$$\n\\|(x_n, y_n)-(x,y)\\| = \\|(x_n-x, y_n-y)\\| = \\|x_n-x\\|_{X} + \\|y_n-y\\|_{Y}.\n$$\nAs $n\\to\\infty$, we have $\\|x_n-x\\|_{X} \\to 0$ and $\\|y_n-y\\|_{Y} \\to 0$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\|(x_n, y_n)-(x,y)\\| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (\\|x_n-x\\|_{X} + \\|y_n-y\\|_{Y}) = 0+0=0.\n$$\nThis shows that the sequence $\\{(x_n, y_n)\\}$ converges to $(x,y)$ in the space $X\\times Y$. Since we have shown that an arbitrary Cauchy sequence in $X\\times Y$ converges to an element in $X\\times Y$, the space $(X\\times Y,\\|\\cdot\\|)$ is complete. As a complete normed vector space, it is by definition a Banach space.\n\n**(b) Boundedness and operator norms of projections.**\n\nThe coordinate projections are $P_{X}:X\\times Y\\to X$ defined by $P_{X}(x,y)=x$ and $P_{Y}:X\\times Y\\to Y$ defined by $P_{Y}(x,y)=y$.\n\nFirst, we show that $P_X$ and $P_Y$ are linear operators. For any scalars $\\alpha, \\beta$ and vectors $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \\in X\\times Y$:\n$$\nP_X(\\alpha(x_1,y_1)+\\beta(x_2,y_2)) = P_X(\\alpha x_1+\\beta x_2, \\alpha y_1+\\beta y_2) = \\alpha x_1+\\beta x_2 = \\alpha P_X(x_1,y_1) + \\beta P_X(x_2,y_2).\n$$\n$$\nP_Y(\\alpha(x_1,y_1)+\\beta(x_2,y_2)) = P_Y(\\alpha x_1+\\beta x_2, \\alpha y_1+\\beta y_2) = \\alpha y_1+\\beta y_2 = \\alpha P_Y(x_1,y_1) + \\beta P_Y(x_2,y_2).\n$$\nThus, both $P_X$ and $P_Y$ are linear operators.\n\nNext, we establish their boundedness. We can do this directly or by using the Closed Graph Theorem. The problem asks to use the theorem where appropriate. The domain $X\\times Y$ and codomains $X$ and $Y$ are all Banach spaces.\nLet's use the Closed Graph Theorem for $P_X$. The graph of $P_X$ is a subset of $(X\\times Y) \\times X$:\n$$\nG(P_X) = \\{((x,y), P_X(x,y)) \\mid (x,y)\\in X\\times Y\\} = \\{((x,y), x) \\mid (x,y)\\in X\\times Y\\}.\n$$\nTo show $G(P_X)$ is closed, let $\\{((x_n,y_n), z_n)\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ be a sequence in $G(P_X)$ that converges to a limit $((x,y),z) \\in (X\\times Y)\\times X$. For each $n$, we have $z_n = P_X(x_n,y_n)=x_n$.\nThe convergence means that $(x_n,y_n) \\to (x,y)$ in $X\\times Y$ and $z_n \\to z$ in $X$.\nThe convergence in $X\\times Y$ implies $\\|(x_n,y_n)-(x,y)\\| = \\|x_n-x\\|_X + \\|y_n-y\\|_Y \\to 0$. This forces $\\|x_n-x\\|_X \\to 0$, so $x_n \\to x$ in $X$.\nWe have two facts: $z_n=x_n$ for all $n$, $z_n\\to z$, and $x_n\\to x$. By the uniqueness of limits in a normed space, we must have $z=x$.\nSo the limit point is $((x,y),x)$. This point is in the form $((u,v), P_X(u,v))$ for $(u,v)=(x,y)$, so it belongs to $G(P_X)$.\nThus, $G(P_X)$ is closed. By the Closed Graph Theorem, the linear operator $P_X$ is bounded.\nAn identical argument shows that the graph of $P_Y$, $G(P_Y) = \\{((x,y), y) \\mid (x,y)\\in X\\times Y\\}$, is also closed, and therefore $P_Y$ is a bounded linear operator.\n\nNow we compute their operator norms. The operator norm of a bounded linear operator $T:V\\to W$ is given by $\\|T\\| = \\sup_{v\\neq 0} \\frac{\\|T(v)\\|_W}{\\|v\\|_V}$.\n\nFor $P_X$:\n$$\n\\|P_X\\| = \\sup_{(x,y)\\neq(0_X,0_Y)} \\frac{\\|P_X(x,y)\\|_X}{\\|(x,y)\\|} = \\sup_{(x,y)\\neq(0_X,0_Y)} \\frac{\\|x\\|_X}{\\|x\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y}.\n$$\nSince $\\|y\\|_Y \\geq 0$, the denominator is always greater than or equal to the numerator, so $\\|x\\|_X \\leq \\|x\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y$. This implies $\\frac{\\|x\\|_X}{\\|x\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y} \\leq 1$ for all $(x,y)\\neq(0_X,0_Y)$. Thus, $\\|P_X\\| \\leq 1$.\nTo see if this upper bound is achieved, we consider specific elements. Assuming $X$ is not the trivial space $\\{0_X\\}$, we can choose an arbitrary $x \\in X$ with $x \\neq 0_X$ and set $y=0_Y$.\nFor such elements $(x, 0_Y)$ with $x\\neq 0_X$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\|P_X(x,0_Y)\\|_X}{\\|(x,0_Y)\\|} = \\frac{\\|x\\|_X}{\\|x\\|_X+\\|0_Y\\|_Y} = \\frac{\\|x\\|_X}{\\|x\\|_X+0} = 1.\n$$\nSince the value $1$ is achieved for some elements, the supremum must be $1$. Therefore, $\\|P_X\\|=1$. (If $X=\\{0_X\\}$, then $P_X$ is the zero operator and its norm is $0$.) We proceed under the standard assumption that the spaces are non-trivial.\n\nFor $P_Y$:\n$$\n\\|P_Y\\| = \\sup_{(x,y)\\neq(0_X,0_Y)} \\frac{\\|P_Y(x,y)\\|_Y}{\\|(x,y)\\|} = \\sup_{(x,y)\\neq(0_X,0_Y)} \\frac{\\|y\\|_Y}{\\|x\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y}.\n$$\nSimilarly, since $\\|x\\|_X \\geq 0$, we have $\\|y\\|_Y \\leq \\|x\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y$, which implies $\\frac{\\|y\\|_Y}{\\|x\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y} \\leq 1$. Thus, $\\|P_Y\\| \\leq 1$.\nAssuming $Y$ is not the trivial space $\\{0_Y\\}$, we can choose $y\\in Y$ with $y\\neq 0_Y$ and set $x=0_X$.\nFor such elements $(0_X, y)$ with $y\\neq 0_Y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\|P_Y(0_X,y)\\|_Y}{\\|(0_X,y)\\|} = \\frac{\\|y\\|_Y}{\\|0_X\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y} = \\frac{\\|y\\|_Y}{0+\\|y\\|_Y} = 1.\n$$\nSince the value $1$ is achieved, the supremum is $1$. Therefore, $\\|P_Y\\|=1$.\n\nThe operator norms are $\\|P_X\\|=1$ and $\\|P_Y\\|=1$, assuming $X$ and $Y$ are non-trivial Banach spaces.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3057906"}, {"introduction": "The Closed Graph Theorem provides a powerful criterion for proving an operator is continuous.

Applying the sequential criterion for closed sets to $G(T)$, we can establish the definition of a closed operator. A sequence in $G(T)$ is of the form $(x_n, Tx_n)$ where $x_n \\in \\mathrm{D}(T)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. If this sequence converges to a limit $(x,y) \\in X \\times Y$, the condition for $G(T)$ to be closed is that this limit point must also be in $G(T)$. For $(x,y)$ to be in $G(T)$, it must satisfy two conditions: $x \\in \\mathrm{D}(T)$ and $y=Tx$.\n\nTherefore, $G(T)$ is closed if and only if for any sequence $(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ in $\\mathrm{D}(T)$ such that $x_n \\to x$ in $X$ and $Tx_n \\to y$ in $Y$, it follows that $x \\in \\mathrm{D}(T)$ and $y=Tx$.\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this formal definition.\n\nA. $G(T)$ is closed in $X\\times Y$ if and only if for every sequence $(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ in $\\mathrm{D}(T)$ such that $(x_n,Tx_n)\\to (x,y)$ in $X\\times Y$, one has $x\\in \\mathrm{D}(T)$ and $y=Tx$.\n\nThis statement is a direct application of the sequential characterization of a closed set to the graph $G(T)$.\nLet's prove the two implications in the \"if and only if\" statement.\n($\\Rightarrow$) Assume $G(T)$ is closed.

Since $G(T)$ is closed, it must contain the limit points of all its convergent sequences. Thus, the limit point $(x,y)$ must belong to $G(T)$.

To show $G(T)$ is closed, we must show that any convergent sequence of points in $G(T)$ has its limit in $G(T)$. Let $((x_n, Tx_n))_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ be a convergent sequence in $G(T)$ with limit $(x,y) \\in X\\times Y$. By our assumption, this immediately implies that $x \\in \\mathrm{D}(T)$ and $y=Tx$, which means $(x,y) \\in G(T)$. Thus, $G(T)$ is closed. This direction is also correct.\nBoth implications hold, so the statement is a correct \"if and only if\" characterization.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. $G(T)$ is closed in $X\\times Y$ if and only if for every sequence $(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ in $\\mathrm{D}(T)$ with $x_n\\to x$ in $X$, one has $Tx_n\\to Tx$ in $Y$.\n\nThe condition \"for every sequence $(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ in $\\mathrm{D}(T)$ with $x_n\\to x$ in $X$, one has $Tx_n\\to Tx$ in $Y$\" is the definition of the continuity of the operator $T$ on its domain $\\mathrm{D}(T)$. This statement claims that an operator being closed is equivalent to it being continuous. This is generally false.\n\nA continuous operator with a closed domain is always a closed operator. However, a closed operator is not necessarily continuous. A standard counterexample is the differentiation operator. Let $X=Y=C([0,1])$ be the space of continuous functions on $[0,1]$ with the supremum norm $\\|f\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{t\\in[0,1]}|f(t)|$. Let $\\mathrm{D}(T) = C^1([0,1]) \\subset X$ be the space of continuously differentiable functions on $[0,1]$, and let $Tf = f'$.\nThe operator $T$ is closed: If $(f_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence in $C^1([0,1])$ such that $f_n \\to f$ uniformly and $f_n' \\to g$ uniformly, a standard theorem from real analysis guarantees that $f$ is differentiable and $f'=g$. Since $g$ is a uniform limit of continuous functions, it is continuous. So $f \\in C^1([0,1])$. Thus, $x \\in \\mathrm{D}(T)$ and $y=Tx$, so $G(T)$ is closed.\nThe operator $T$ is not continuous (unbounded): Consider the sequence $f_n(x) = n^{-1} \\sin(nx)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We have $\\|f_n\\|_\\infty = n^{-1} \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$, so $f_n \\to 0$ in $X$. However, $Tf_n(x) = f_n'(x) = \\cos(nx)$, and $\\|Tf_n\\|_\\infty = 1$. This sequence does not converge to $T(0)=0$. Thus, $T$ is not continuous.\nSince we have an operator that is closed but not continuous, the equivalence claimed in the statement is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Suppose $T$ is linear and $G(T)$ is closed. If $X$ is complete, then $T$ is bounded (that is, continuous).\n\nThis is a misstatement of the Closed Graph Theorem. The full Closed Graph Theorem states: If $X$ and $Y$ are Banach spaces (complete normed linear spaces) and $T: X \\to Y$ is a linear operator (with $\\mathrm{D}(T)=X$), then $T$ is continuous if and only if its graph $G(T)$ is closed.\nThe statement in this option omits two crucial hypotheses:\n1.  It does not require $Y$ to be a Banach space (complete).\n2.  It does not require the domain of the operator to be the entire space $X$, i.e., $\\mathrm{D}(T)=X$.\n\nThe counterexample from option B demonstrates why this statement is false. Let $X=Y=C([0,1])$ with the sup norm. $X$ is a Banach space, hence complete. Let $T$ be the differentiation operator with domain $\\mathrm{D}(T) = C^1([0,1])$. As shown before, $T$ is linear and has a closed graph, but is not bounded (continuous). This counterexample satisfies all the hypotheses of statement C ($T$ is linear, $G(T)$ is closed, $X$ is complete) but fails the conclusion ($T$ is not bounded). The failure is due to $\\mathrm{D}(T) \\neq X$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. If for every sequence $(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ in $\\mathrm{D}(T)$ with $x_n\\to x$ in $X$ and $Tx_n\\to y$ in $Y$ one has $x\\in \\mathrm{D}(T)$ and $y=Tx$, then $G(T)$ is closed.\n\nThis statement corresponds to the ($\\Leftarrow$) direction of the equivalence in statement A, phrased using component-wise convergence.\nLet's verify it. The hypothesis is: whenever a sequence $(x_n)$ in $\\mathrm{D}(T)$ is such that $x_n \\to x$ and $Tx_n \\to y$, it must be that the limit point $(x,y)$ belongs to the graph in the sense that $x \\in \\mathrm{D}(T)$ and $y=Tx$.\nTo prove that $G(T)$ is closed, we must take an arbitrary convergent sequence of points from $G(T)$ and show its limit is also in $G(T)$. Let $((x_n, Tx_n))_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence in $G(T)$ that converges to some point $(x,y) \\in X\\times Y$. By the problem's reminder, convergence in the product space is equivalent to component-wise convergence, so we have $x_n \\to x$ in $X$ and $Tx_n \\to y$ in $Y$. Now, the hypothesis of the statement applies directly. It allows us to conclude that $x \\in \\mathrm{D}(T)$ and $y=Tx$. This means the limit point $(x,y)$ is an element of $G(T)$. Since this holds for any arbitrary convergent sequence in $G(T)$, the set $G(T)$ is closed.\nThe statement is therefore a correct sufficient condition for the graph to be closed.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. If $G(T)$ is closed and $T$ is linear, then $T$ is bounded on every bounded subset of $\\mathrm{D}(T)$.\n\nFor a linear operator, being bounded (i.e., continuous) is equivalent to being bounded on any (and every) bounded subset of its domain. Specifically, an operator $T$ is bounded if there exists $M \\ge 0$ such that $\\|Tx\\|_Y \\le M \\|x\\|_X$ for all $x \\in \\mathrm{D}(T)$. This is equivalent to saying that $T$ maps the unit ball in $\\mathrm{D}(T)$ to a bounded set in $Y$. By linearity, this implies $T$ maps any bounded set in $\\mathrm{D}(T)$ to a bounded set in $Y$.\nSo, this statement is asserting that if a linear operator is closed, it must be bounded (continuous).\nAs we established in the analysis of option B, this is false. The differentiation operator $T=d/dx$ on $\\mathrm{D}(T)=C^1([0,1])$ is linear and closed, but not bounded. Let's demonstrate that it is not bounded on a bounded subset. Consider the set $S=\\{f \\in C^1([0,1]) : \\|f\\|_\\infty \\le 1\\}$. This is a bounded subset of $\\mathrm{D}(T)$. Consider the sequence of functions $f_n(x)=x^n$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Each $f_n \\in C^1([0,1])$ and $\\|f_n\\|_\\infty = 1$, so $f_n \\in S$ for all $n$. The image of this sequence under $T$ is $Tf_n(x) = f_n'(x) = nx^{n-1}$. The norm in $Y$ is $\\|Tf_n\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{x\\in[0,1]} |nx^{n-1}| = n$. The sequence of norms $(\\|Tf_n\\|_\\infty)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}} = (n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ is unbounded. Therefore, the image of the bounded set $S$ under $T$, $T(S)$, is an unbounded set. This contradicts the conclusion of the statement.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3057912"}, {"introduction": "The Open Mapping Theorem guarantees that certain linear operators map open sets to open sets, a result with profound consequences.

In particular, prove that there exists a constant $M0$ depending only on $T$ such that whenever $B_{X}(x_{0},r)\\subset U$ for some $x_{0}\\in X$ and $r0$, one has $B_{Y}(T(x_{0}),r/M)\\subset T(U)$.\n2. Specialize to the finite-dimensional case $X=Y=\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the Euclidean norm and the operator $T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ defined by $T(x)=A x$ with\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n3  -1\\\\\n2  \\phantom{-}4\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nLet $U=B_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}(x_{0},r)$ with $x_{0}=(1,-2)$ and $r=\\tfrac{1}{2}$. Compute a rigorous lower bound $\\rho0$ such that the Euclidean ball $B_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}(T(x_{0}),\\rho)$ is guaranteed to be contained in $T(U)$. Express $\\rho$ in exact closed form. No rounding is required, and no physical units are involved.\nThe final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for $\\rho$.", "solution": "The user has provided a two-part problem concerning the Open Mapping Theorem. The problem is valid as it is mathematically sound, well-posed, and all necessary conditions and definitions are provided.\n\n### Part 1: Proof of the Open Mapping Principle\n\nThe first task is to prove a key consequence of the Open Mapping Theorem. Let $X$ and $Y$ be Banach spaces and let $T: X \\to Y$ be a surjective bounded linear operator. We must show that for any nonempty open set $U \\subset X$, the image $T(U)$ has a nonempty interior. Specifically, we need to show the existence of a constant $M > 0$ such that if $B_X(x_0, r) \\subset U$, then $B_Y(T(x_0), r/M) \\subset T(U)$.\n\nThe proof proceeds in several steps.\n\n**Step 1: Reduction of the problem**\n\nFirst, we show that it is sufficient to prove that the image of the open unit ball in $X$, $B_X(0, 1)$, contains an open ball centered at the origin in $Y$. Let us assume that there exists some $\\delta > 0$ such that $B_Y(0, \\delta) \\subset T(B_X(0, 1))$.\n\nLet $U \\subset X$ be an arbitrary nonempty open set. For any $x_0 \\in U$, by the definition of an open set, there exists an $r > 0$ such that the open ball $B_X(x_0, r)$ is contained in $U$. An element $x \\in B_X(x_0, r)$ can be written as $x = x_0 + z$, where $z \\in B_X(0, r)$. The condition $\\|x - x_0\\|  r$ is equivalent to $\\|z\\|  r$, which can be written as $\\|(1/r)z\\|  1$. So, $B_X(x_0, r) = x_0 + r B_X(0, 1)$.\n\nSince $B_X(x_0, r) \\subset U$, we have $T(B_X(x_0, r)) \\subset T(U)$. By the linearity of $T$:\n$$T(B_X(x_0, r)) = T(x_0 + r B_X(0, 1)) = T(x_0) + T(r B_X(0, 1)) = T(x_0) + r T(B_X(0, 1))$$\nUsing our assumption that $B_Y(0, \\delta) \\subset T(B_X(0, 1))$, we get:\n$$T(U) \\supset T(x_0) + r T(B_X(0, 1)) \\supset T(x_0) + r B_Y(0, \\delta) = B_Y(T(x_0), r\\delta)$$\nThis shows that $T(U)$ contains an open ball around $T(x_0)$ for any $x_0 \\in U$, which implies $T(U)$ is open. The problem asks for a constant $M$ such that $B_Y(T(x_0), r/M) \\subset T(U)$. Comparing this with $B_Y(T(x_0), r\\delta)$, we can identify $M = 1/\\delta$. This constant $M$ depends only on $T$ (as $\\delta$ does), not on $U$, $x_0$, or $r$.\n\nThus, the core of the proof is to establish that $T(B_X(0, 1))$ contains an open ball centered at the origin in $Y$.\n\n**Step 2: Application of the Baire Category Theorem**\n\nSince $T$ is surjective, every point in $Y$ is the image of some point in $X$. We can write $X$ as the union of balls centered at the origin: $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty B_X(0, n)$. Applying $T$, we have:\n$$Y = T(X) = T\\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty B_X(0, n)\\right) = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty T(B_X(0, n))$$\nSince $Y$ is a Banach space, it is a complete metric space. The Baire Category Theorem states that a complete metric space cannot be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets. Therefore, at least one of the sets in the union must not be nowhere dense. This means there exists an integer $n_0 \\ge 1$ such that the closure $\\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0))}$ has a nonempty interior.\nSo, there exist $y_0 \\in Y$ and $\\epsilon > 0$ such that the open ball $B_Y(y_0, \\epsilon)$ is contained in $\\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0))}$.\n\n**Step 3: Centering the ball at the origin**\n\nWe now show that the closure of the image of a ball centered at the origin in $X$ contains a ball centered at the origin in $Y$.\nWe have $B_Y(y_0, \\epsilon) \\subset \\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0))}$. The set $B_X(0, n_0)$ is symmetric with respect to the origin (i.e., if $z \\in B_X(0, n_0)$, then $-z \\in B_X(0, n_0)$).\nSince $y_0 \\in \\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0))}$, the ball $B_Y(0, \\epsilon) = B_Y(y_0, \\epsilon) - y_0$ is contained in $\\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0))} - y_0$.\nSince $y_0$ is in the closure, it is a limit point of $T(B_X(0,n_0))$. This implies $\\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0))} - y_0 \\subset \\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0)) - T(B_X(0, n_0))}$. By linearity of $T$, this is $\\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0) - B_X(0, n_0))}$.\nFor any $u, v \\in B_X(0, n_0)$, we have $\\|u-v\\| \\le \\|u\\| + \\|v\\|  n_0 + n_0 = 2n_0$. Thus, $B_X(0, n_0) - B_X(0, n_0) \\subset B_X(0, 2n_0)$.\nCombining these facts:\n$$B_Y(0, \\epsilon) \\subset \\overline{T(B_X(0, 2n_0))} = \\overline{T(2n_0 B_X(0, 1))} = 2n_0 \\overline{T(B_X(0, 1))}$$\nwhere we used the linearity of $T$ and the property that for a linear operator $L$ and a set $S$, $\\overline{L(\\alpha S)} = \\alpha \\overline{L(S)}$ for a scalar $\\alpha$.\nLet $\\delta' = \\epsilon/(2n_0) > 0$. We have shown that $B_Y(0, \\delta') \\subset \\overline{T(B_X(0, 1))}$.\n\n**Step 4: The \"gluing\" argument to remove the closure**\n\nThe final step is to show that if the closure of $T(B_X(0,1))$ contains a ball, then $T(B_X(0,1))$ itself (without the closure) contains a (possibly smaller) ball. From the previous step, by scaling, we have for any $k \\ge 0$:\n$$B_Y(0, \\delta'/2^k) \\subset \\overline{T(B_X(0, 1/2^k))}$$\nLet's pick an arbitrary $y \\in B_Y(0, \\delta'/2)$. We will construct an $x \\in B_X(0, 1)$ such that $T(x) = y$.\nSince $y \\in B_Y(0, \\delta'/2)$, it is also in $\\overline{T(B_X(0, 1/2))}$. Thus, we can find an $x_0 \\in B_X(0, 1/2)$ such that $\\|y - T(x_0)\\|  \\delta'/4$.\nLet $y_1 = y - T(x_0)$. Then $y_1 \\in B_Y(0, \\delta'/4)$.\nSince $y_1 \\in \\overline{T(B_X(0, 1/4))}$, we can find an $x_1 \\in B_X(0, 1/4)$ such that $\\|y_1 - T(x_1)\\|  \\delta'/8$.\nLet $y_2 = y_1 - T(x_1) = y - T(x_0) - T(x_1)$. Then $y_2 \\in B_Y(0, \\delta'/8)$.\nContinuing this process inductively, we construct a sequence $\\{x_k\\}_{k=0}^\\infty$ in $X$ such that for each $k$:\n1. $x_k \\in B_X(0, 1/2^{k+1})$ (so $\\|x_k\\|  1/2^{k+1}$)\n2. $\\|y - \\sum_{i=0}^k T(x_i)\\|  \\delta'/2^{k+2}$\n\nConsider the partial sums $s_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n x_k$. For $m > n$, we have:\n$$\\|s_m - s_n\\| = \\left\\|\\sum_{k=n+1}^m x_k\\right\\| \\le \\sum_{k=n+1}^m \\|x_k\\|  \\sum_{k=n+1}^m \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}}$$\nSince the geometric series $\\sum 1/2^{k+1}$ converges, the sequence $\\{s_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X$. As $X$ is a Banach space, it is complete, so the sequence converges to a limit $x = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} s_n \\in X$.\nThe norm of the limit is:\n$$\\|x\\| = \\left\\|\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty x_k\\right\\| \\le \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\|x_k\\|  \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} = \\frac{1/2}{1-1/2} = 1$$\nSo, $x \\in B_X(0, 1)$.\nSince $T$ is a bounded (and thus continuous) linear operator:\n$$T(x) = T(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} s_n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} T(s_n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} T\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^n x_k\\right) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{k=0}^n T(x_k)$$\nFrom condition 2 in our construction, $\\|y - \\sum_{i=0}^k T(x_i)\\| \\to 0$ as $k \\to \\infty$. This means $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\sum_{i=0}^k T(x_i) = y$.\nTherefore, $T(x) = y$.\nWe have shown that for any $y \\in B_Y(0, \\delta'/2)$, there exists an $x \\in B_X(0, 1)$ with $T(x) = y$. This proves that $B_Y(0, \\delta'/2) \\subset T(B_X(0, 1))$.\n\nLet $\\delta = \\delta'/2$. We have established that $T(B_X(0, 1))$ contains the open ball $B_Y(0, \\delta)$. As shown in Step 1, this completes the proof with $M = 1/\\delta$.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation for a Specific Operator\n\nWe are given $X = Y = \\mathbb{R}^2$ with the Euclidean norm. The operator is $T(x) = Ax$ where $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  -1 \\\\ 2  4 \\end{pmatrix}$. The set is $U = B_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(x_0, r)$ with $x_0 = (1, -2)$ and $r = 1/2$. We need to find a rigorous lower bound $\\rho > 0$ such that $B_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(T(x_0), \\rho) \\subset T(U)$.\n\nThe image of $U$ under $T$ is:\n$$T(U) = T(B(x_0, r)) = \\{ Ax : \\|x - x_0\\|_2  r \\}$$\nLet $z = x - x_0$. Then $x = z + x_0$ and $\\|z\\|_2  r$.\n$$T(U) = \\{ A(z+x_0) : \\|z\\|_2  r \\} = \\{ Az + Ax_0 : \\|z\\|_2  r \\} = T(x_0) + \\{ Az : \\|z\\|_2  r \\}$$\nWe wish to find the largest $\\rho$ such that $B(T(x_0), \\rho) \\subset T(U)$, which is equivalent to finding the largest $\\rho$ such that $B(0, \\rho) \\subset \\{ Az : \\|z\\|_2  r \\}$.\n\nThe matrix $A$ is invertible since $\\det(A) = 3(4) - (-1)(2) = 14 \\ne 0$. Thus, $T$ is an isomorphism and we can consider its inverse $T^{-1}(y)=A^{-1}y$.\nThe set $\\{ Az : \\|z\\|_2  r \\}$ consists of all vectors $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $y = Az$ for some $z$ with $\\|z\\|_2  r$. This is equivalent to $z = A^{-1}y$, so the condition on $y$ is $\\|A^{-1}y\\|_2  r$.\n\nThe problem now becomes finding the largest $\\rho$ such that the ball $\\|y\\|_2  \\rho$ is contained in the set defined by $\\|A^{-1}y\\|_2  r$.\nWe know that for any vector $y$, $\\|A^{-1}y\\|_2 \\le \\|A^{-1}\\|_{op} \\|y\\|_2$, where $\\|A^{-1}\\|_{op}$ is the operator norm of $A^{-1}$ (the spectral norm).\nIf we require $\\|A^{-1}\\|_{op} \\|y\\|_2  r$, which means $\\|y\\|_2  r / \\|A^{-1}\\|_{op}$, then the condition $\\|A^{-1}y\\|_2  r$ is guaranteed to be satisfied.\nThe value $\\rho = r / \\|A^{-1}\\|_{op}$ gives the radius of the largest ball centered at the origin that is guaranteed to be contained in the image set. In finite dimensions, this is not just a lower bound but the exact radius of the largest inscribed ball.\n\nWe now compute $\\|A^{-1}\\|_{op}$. The operator norm is given by $\\|B\\|_{op} = \\sqrt{\\lambda_{max}(B^T B)}$, where $\\lambda_{max}$ is the largest eigenvalue.\nFirst, we find $A^{-1}$:\n$$A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ -2  3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{14} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ -2  3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNext, we compute $(A^{-1})^T A^{-1}$:\n$$(A^{-1})^T = \\frac{1}{14} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  -2 \\\\ 1  3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$(A^{-1})^T A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{14^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  -2 \\\\ 1  3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ -2  3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{196} \\begin{pmatrix} (4)(4)+(-2)(-2)  (4)(1)+(-2)(3) \\\\ (1)(4)+(3)(-2)  (1)(1)+(3)(3) \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$(A^{-1})^T A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{196} \\begin{pmatrix} 16+4  4-6 \\\\ 4-6  1+9 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{196} \\begin{pmatrix} 20  -2 \\\\ -2  10 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nLet $C = \\begin{pmatrix} 20  -2 \\\\ -2  10 \\end{pmatrix}$. We find the eigenvalues of $C$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(C - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ (20-\\lambda)(10-\\lambda) - (-2)(-2) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - 30\\lambda + 200 - 4 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - 30\\lambda + 196 = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula for the eigenvalues $\\lambda_C$ of $C$:\n$$ \\lambda_C = \\frac{30 \\pm \\sqrt{(-30)^2 - 4(1)(196)}}{2} = \\frac{30 \\pm \\sqrt{900 - 784}}{2} = \\frac{30 \\pm \\sqrt{116}}{2} $$\nSince $\\sqrt{116} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 29} = 2\\sqrt{29}$, we have:\n$$ \\lambda_C = \\frac{30 \\pm 2\\sqrt{29}}{2} = 15 \\pm \\sqrt{29} $$\nThe eigenvalues of $(A^{-1})^T A^{-1}$ are these values divided by $196$. The largest eigenvalue is:\n$$ \\lambda_{max}((A^{-1})^T A^{-1}) = \\frac{15 + \\sqrt{29}}{196} $$\nThe operator norm of $A^{-1}$ is the square root of this value:\n$$ \\|A^{-1}\\|_{op} = \\sqrt{\\frac{15 + \\sqrt{29}}{196}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{29}}}{14} $$\nFinally, we compute $\\rho$ using $r = 1/2$:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{r}{\\|A^{-1}\\|_{op}} = \\frac{1/2}{\\frac{\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{29}}}{14}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{14}{\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{29}}} = \\frac{7}{\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{29}}} $$\nThis is the required rigorous lower bound, expressed in exact closed form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{7}{\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{29}}}}$$", "id": "3057908"}]}
