The map $F$ is defined by its component functions:\n$$\ny^{1} = (x^{1})^{2} - x^{2} \\\\\ny^{2} = x^{1} + \\exp(x^{2})\n$$\nWhen we write $y^1$ and $y^2$ in this context, we are referring to the compositions $y^1 \\circ F$ and $y^2 \\circ F$ which are functions on the domain $U$.\n\nThe pullback operator $F^{*}$ satisfies two fundamental properties which we will use for this computation:\n1. For any differential forms $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, $F^{*}(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = (F^{*}\\alpha) \\wedge (F^{*}\\beta)$.\n2. For any smooth function $g$ on the target manifold, $F^{*}(dg) = d(g \\circ F)$.\n\nApplying the first property to $\\omega = dy^{1} \\wedge dy^{2}$, we get:\n$$\nF^{*}\\omega = F^{*}(dy^{1} \\wedge dy^{2}) = (F^{*}dy^{1}) \\wedge (F^{*}dy^{2})\n$$\nNow, we apply the second property to each term, $F^{*}dy^{1}$ and $F^{*}dy^{2}$. The functions $y^{1}$ and $y^{2}$ are coordinate functions on the target space.

The scalar factor is the function $f(x^{1}, x^{2}) = 2x^{1}\\exp(x^{2}) + 1$.\nThis factor is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the transformation $F$.

The $2$-form $dx^{1} \\wedge dx^{2}$ represents an infinitesimal element of oriented area in the source space $U$. The map $F$ transforms this infinitesimal area element at $(x^{1}, x^{2})$ into a corresponding infinitesimal area element in the target space. The scalar factor $\\det(J_F) = 2x^{1}\\exp(x^{2}) + 1$ is precisely the ratio of the oriented area of the transformed element to the oriented area of the original element. In other words, it quantifies how much the map $F$ locally stretches, shrinks, and possibly reflects (if the sign is negative) areas at each point.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(2x^{1}\\exp(x^{2}) + 1) dx^{1} \\wedge dx^{2}}\n$$", "id": "3059611"}, {"introduction": "Next, we turn to the interior product, the operation that contracts a differential form with a vector field to produce a form of lower degree.

So, $x=u^2$, $y=uv$, $z=v$. The pullbacks of the basic $1$-forms are:\n    $F^*dx = d(u^2) = 2u\\,du$\n    $F^*dy = d(uv) = v\\,du + u\\,dv$\n    $F^*dz = d(v) = dv$\n\n    Now we pull back the wedge products:\n    $F^*(dy \\wedge dz) = (v\\,du + u\\,dv) \\wedge dv = v\\,du \\wedge dv$\n    $F^*(dz \\wedge dx) = dv \\wedge (2u\\,du) = -2u\\,du \\wedge dv$\n    $F^*(dx \\wedge dy) = (2u\\,du) \\wedge (v\\,du + u\\,dv) = 2u^2\\,du \\wedge dv$\n\n    Using the property $F^*(g\\alpha) = (g \\circ F) F^*\\alpha$, we find $F^*\\omega$:\n    $$\n    \\begin{align*}\n    F^*\\omega &= (x \\circ F)F^*(dy \\wedge dz) + (y \\circ F)F^*(dz \\wedge dx) + (z \\circ F)F^*(dx \\wedge dy) \\\\\n    &= (u^2)(v\\,du \\wedge dv) + (uv)(-2u\\,du \\wedge dv) + (v)(2u^2\\,du \\wedge dv) \\\\\n    &= (u^2v - 2u^2v + 2u^2v) du \\wedge dv \\\\\n    &= u^2v\\,du \\wedge dv\n    \\end{align*}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Compute the interior product $i_X(F^*\\omega)$.**\n    The vector field on $M$ is $X = u\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} + v^2\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}$.\n    We apply $i_X$ to the $2$-form $\\alpha = F^*\\omega = u^2v\\,du \\wedge dv$.\n    $$\n    i_X \\alpha = i_X(u^2v\\,du \\wedge dv) = u^2v \\, i_X(du \\wedge dv)\n    $$\n    The interior product of $X$ with $du \\wedge dv$ is:\n    $$\n    i_X(du \\wedge dv) = (i_X du)dv - (i_X dv)du = du(X)dv - dv(X)du\n    $$\n    We evaluate the $1$-forms $du$ and $dv$ on the vector field $X$:\n    $du(X) = du(u\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} + v^2\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}) = u$\n    $dv(X) = dv(u\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} + v^2\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}) = v^2$\n    Substituting these back, we get:\n    $$\n    i_X(du \\wedge dv) = u\\,dv - v^2\\,du\n    $$\n    Therefore, the interior product is:\n    $$\n    i_X (F^*\\omega) = u^2v(u\\,dv - v^2\\,du) = u^3v\\,dv - u^2v^3\\,du\n    $$\n\n3.  **Compute the exterior derivative $d(i_X F^*\\omega)$.**\n    Let $\\beta = i_X F^*\\omega = -u^2v^3\\,du + u^3v\\,dv$. We compute $d\\beta$:\n    $$\n    \\begin{align*}\n    d\\beta &= d(-u^2v^3\\,du + u^3v\\,dv) \\\\\n    &= d(-u^2v^3) \\wedge du + d(u^3v) \\wedge dv \\\\\n    &= \\left(\\frac{\\partial(-u^2v^3)}{\\partial v} dv\\right) \\wedge du + \\left(\\frac{\\partial(u^3v)}{\\partial u} du\\right) \\wedge dv \\\\\n    &= (-3u^2v^2) dv \\wedge du + (3u^2v) du \\wedge dv \\\\\n    &= (3u^2v^2) du \\wedge dv + (3u^2v) du \\wedge dv \\\\\n    &= (3u^2v + 3u^2v^2) du \\wedge dv = 3u^2v(1+v) du \\wedge dv\n    \\end{align*}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the resulting $2$-form at point $p$ on vectors $A$ and $B$.**\n    The point is $p=(1,2)$, so $u=1$ and $v=2$. The tangent vectors in $T_pM$ are $A = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} + 2\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}$ and $B = 3\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}$.\n    We must evaluate $\\big(3u^2v(1+v) du \\wedge dv\\big)_p(A,B)$.\n    First, evaluate the coefficient function $3u^2v(1+v)$ at $p=(1,2)$:\n    $$\n    3(1)^2(2)(1+2) = 3(2)(3) = 18\n    $$\n    Next, evaluate the $2$-form $du \\wedge dv$ on the vectors $A$ and $B$:\n    $$\n    (du \\wedge dv)(A,B) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} du(A) & du(B) \\\\ dv(A) & dv(B) \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The components are:\n    $du(A) = du(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} + 2\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}) = 1$\n    $dv(A) = dv(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} + 2\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}) = 2$\n    $du(B) = du(3\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}) = 3$\n    $dv(B) = dv(3\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}) = -1$\n    The determinant is:\n    $$\n    \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (1)(-1) - (3)(2) = -1 - 6 = -7\n    $$\n    Finally, we multiply the coefficient at $p$ by this value:\n    $$\n    S = 18 \\times (-7) = -126\n    $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-126}$$", "id": "3059688"}]}
