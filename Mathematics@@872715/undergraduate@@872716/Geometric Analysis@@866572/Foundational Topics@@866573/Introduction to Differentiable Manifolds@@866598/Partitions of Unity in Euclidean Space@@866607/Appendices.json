It is mathematically well-posed, self-contained, and scientifically grounded. We shall proceed with the construction and proof.\n\nThe goal is to construct a radial function $\\eta \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ such that $\\eta(x) > 0$ for $\\|x\\|  1$ and $\\eta(x) = 0$ for $\\|x\\| \\ge 1$. The construction relies on a one-dimensional auxiliary function that is $C^{\\infty}$ but not analytic.\n\nLet us first define a function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as follows:\n$$ g(t) = \\begin{cases} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{t}\\right)  \\text{if } t > 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } t \\le 0 \\end{cases} $$\nWe will prove that $g(t)$ is a $C^{\\infty}$ function on $\\mathbb{R}$. The function is clearly $C^{\\infty}$ for $t \\neq 0$, as it is a composition of $C^{\\infty}$ functions (the exponential function and $t \\mapsto -1/t$) for $t > 0$, and the zero function for $t  0$. The critical point to investigate is $t=0$.\n\nFirst, we check continuity at $t=0$. The left-sided limit is $\\lim_{t \\to 0^-} g(t) = 0$, which equals $g(0)$. For the right-sided limit, let $s = 1/t$. As $t \\to 0^+$, $s \\to \\infty$.\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} g(t) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{t}\\right) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\exp(-s) = 0 $$\nSince the left and right limits both equal $g(0)$, the function $g$ is continuous at $t=0$.\n\nNext, we prove that all derivatives of $g$ exist at $t=0$ and are equal to $0$. We will show by induction that for any integer $k \\ge 0$, the $k$-th derivative of $g(t)$ for $t>0$ has the form $g^{(k)}(t) = P_k(1/t) \\exp(-1/t)$ for some polynomial $P_k$, and that the derivative at $t=0$ is $g^{(k)}(0)=0$.\n\nThe base case $k=0$ is $g(t) = P_0(1/t) \\exp(-1/t)$ with $P_0(s)=1$. We have already shown $g(0)=0$.\n\nAssume for some integer $k \\ge 0$ that for $t>0$, $g^{(k)}(t) = P_k(1/t) \\exp(-1/t)$ for some polynomial $P_k$, and that $g^{(k)}(0)=0$. For $t>0$, the $(k+1)$-th derivative is found by the chain and product rules:\n$$ g^{(k+1)}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ P_k\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{t}\\right) \\right] = P_k'\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{t}\\right) + P_k\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{t}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right) $$\nLet $s=1/t$. Then $g^{(k+1)}(t) = \\left[ -s^2 P_k'(s) + s^2 P_k(s) \\right] \\exp(-s)$. The term in the brackets, $P_{k+1}(s) = s^2(P_k(s) - P_k'(s))$, is a polynomial in $s=1/t$. Thus, the inductive form is maintained for $t>0$.\n\nNow we must show that $g^{(k+1)}(0)=0$. By definition of the derivative:\n$$ g^{(k+1)}(0) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{g^{(k)}(t) - g^{(k)}(0)}{t} $$\nThe left-sided limit is $\\lim_{t \\to 0^-} \\frac{0-0}{t} = 0$. For the right-sided limit:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\frac{g^{(k)}(t)}{t} = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\frac{1}{t} P_k\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{t}\\right) $$\nLet $s=1/t$. As $t \\to 0^+$, $s \\to \\infty$. The limit becomes $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s P_k(s) \\exp(-s)$. Let $Q(s) = s P_k(s)$, which is also a polynomial. We need to show that $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} Q(s) \\exp(-s) = 0$ for any polynomial $Q$.\n\nLet $Q(s)$ be a polynomial of degree $m$. It is sufficient to show that $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s^j \\exp(-s) = 0$ for any non-negative integer $j$. From the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function, we know that for $s>0$, $\\exp(s) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{s^k}{k!}$. Since all terms are positive, we can bound $\\exp(s)$ from below by any single term, for instance, $\\exp(s) > \\frac{s^{j+1}}{(j+1)!}$.\nThis gives us the inequality for $s>0$:\n$$ 0  s^j \\exp(-s) = \\frac{s^j}{\\exp(s)}  \\frac{s^j}{s^{j+1}/(j+1)!} = \\frac{(j+1)!}{s} $$\nAs $s \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{(j+1)!}{s} \\to 0$. By the Squeeze Theorem, we conclude that $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s^j \\exp(-s) = 0$. This holds for any term in the polynomial $Q(s)$, so $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} Q(s) \\exp(-s) = 0$.\n\nThus, $g^{(k+1)}(0) = 0$. By induction, $g^{(k)}(0)=0$ for all $k \\ge 0$. This confirms that $g(t)$ is of class $C^{\\infty}$ on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we construct the desired function $\\eta(x)$. The function must be radial, so it will depend on $\\|x\\|$. We want it to be positive for $\\|x\\|  1$ and zero for $\\|x\\| \\ge 1$. Let us define $\\eta(x)$ using our $C^{\\infty}$ function $g(t)$:\n$$ \\eta(x) = g(1-\\|x\\|^2) $$\nwhere $\\|x\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$. Let's analyze this function:\n1.  If $\\|x\\|  1$, then $0  \\|x\\|^2  1$, which implies $1-\\|x\\|^2 > 0$. In this case, $\\eta(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{1-\\|x\\|^2}\\right)$. Since the argument of the exponential is finite, $\\eta(x) > 0$.\n2.  If $\\|x\\| \\ge 1$, then $\\|x\\|^2 \\ge 1$, which implies $1-\\|x\\|^2 \\le 0$. In this case, by definition of $g$, $\\eta(x) = 0$.\n\nThis function satisfies the positivity and support conditions. We must now prove that $\\eta(x)$ is of class $C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.\nLet $u(x) = 1-\\|x\\|^2$. As $\\|x\\|^2$ is a polynomial in the components of $x$, $u(x)$ is a $C^{\\infty}$ function on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Our function is $\\eta(x) = g(u(x))$.\n\n-   In the open ball $B(0,1) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : \\|x\\|  1\\}$, the function $u(x)$ maps to the interval $(0, 1]$. On this interval for its argument, $g$ is $C^{\\infty}$. Since $\\eta(x)$ is a composition of $C^{\\infty}$ functions ($g$ and $u$) in this domain, it is $C^{\\infty}$ on $B(0,1)$.\n-   In the open set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : \\|x\\| > 1\\}$, $u(x)  0$, so $\\eta(x)$ is identically zero. The zero function is $C^{\\infty}$.\n-   The critical region is the boundary sphere $S^{n-1} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : \\|x\\|=1\\}$. We must show that for any multi-index $\\alpha$, the partial derivative $\\partial^{\\alpha}\\eta(x)$ is continuous at any point $x_0$ with $\\|x_0\\|=1$. Since $\\partial^{\\alpha}\\eta(x) = 0$ for $\\|x\\|>1$, we need to show that $\\lim_{x \\to x_0, \\|x\\|1} \\partial^{\\alpha}\\eta(x) = 0$.\n\nThe partial derivatives of $\\eta(x) = g(u(x))$ for $\\|x\\|1$ are found using the multivariate chain rule (Faà di Bruno's formula). Any partial derivative $\\partial^{\\alpha}\\eta$ is a sum of terms of the form:\n$$ C \\cdot g^{(k)}(u(x)) \\cdot \\prod_{j} (\\partial^{\\beta_j} u(x)) $$\nwhere $1 \\le k \\le |\\alpha|$, $C$ is a constant, and $\\beta_j$ are multi-indices. The derivatives of $u(x)=1-\\|x\\|^2$ are polynomials in the components of $x$ (e.g., $\\partial_i u = -2x_i$, $\\partial_i \\partial_j u = -2\\delta_{ij}$, and higher derivatives are zero). Therefore, for $\\|x\\|1$, $\\partial^{\\alpha}\\eta(x)$ can be expressed as a finite sum:\n$$ \\partial^{\\alpha}\\eta(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{|\\alpha|} Q_k(x) g^{(k)}(1-\\|x\\|^2) $$\nwhere each $Q_k(x)$ is a polynomial in the components $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$.\nFor $\\|x\\|1$, we have $1-\\|x\\|^2 > 0$, so we can substitute the form of $g^{(k)}$:\n$$ \\partial^{\\alpha}\\eta(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{|\\alpha|} Q_k(x) P_k\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\|x\\|^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{1-\\|x\\|^2}\\right) $$\nwhere $P_k$ are the polynomials from our analysis of $g(t)$. Let $x_0$ be a point with $\\|x_0\\|=1$. We examine the limit of a generic term in the sum as $x \\to x_0$ from within the ball $\\|x\\|1$:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to x_0, \\|x\\|1} Q_k(x) P_k\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\|x\\|^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{1-\\|x\\|^2}\\right) $$\nLet $t=1-\\|x\\|^2$. As $x \\to x_0$ with $\\|x\\|1$, we have $t \\to 0^+$. The polynomial $Q_k(x)$ is continuous, so $\\lim_{x\\to x_0} Q_k(x) = Q_k(x_0)$. The limit becomes:\n$$ Q_k(x_0) \\cdot \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} P_k\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{t}\\right) $$\nAs established during the analysis of $g(t)$, this limit is $0$. Since every term in the sum for $\\partial^{\\alpha}\\eta(x)$ approaches $0$ as $x \\to x_0$, we have $\\lim_{x \\to x_0, \\|x\\|1} \\partial^{\\alpha}\\eta(x) = 0$.\nSince $\\partial^{\\alpha}\\eta(x) \\equiv 0$ for $\\|x\\|>1$, the limit from outside the ball is also $0$. Thus, for any multi-index $\\alpha$, the partial derivative $\\partial^{\\alpha}\\eta(x)$ is continuous across the boundary $\\|x\\|=1$ and equals $0$ on it.\nThis completes the proof that $\\eta(x)$ is of class $C^{\\infty}$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nThe constructed function is:\n$$ \\eta(x) = \\begin{cases} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{1-\\|x\\|^2}\\right)  \\text{if } \\|x\\|  1 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } \\|x\\| \\ge 1 \\end{cases} $$\nThis function is radial, $C^{\\infty}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, positive on the open unit ball, and zero on and outside the boundary of the unit ball, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\eta(x) = \\begin{cases} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{1-\\|x\\|^2}\\right)  \\text{if } \\|x\\|  1 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } \\|x\\| \\ge 1 \\end{cases}\n}\n$$", "id": "3059002"}, {"introduction": "With the basic bump function in hand, we can build more versatile tools.

The premises are mathematically sound and the objectives are clearly defined.\n\nWe proceed with the explicit construction of the function $f(x)$, the characterization of its support, and the computation of the measure of its support.\n\n**Part 1: Explicit Construction of the Function $f$**\n\nThe construction of a smooth bump function is typically achieved by composing a basic smooth transition function with a radial coordinate.\n\n**Step 1.1: The Auxiliary Function $h(t)$**\nFirst, we define an auxiliary function $h: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ which is smooth but non-analytic. Let\n$$\nh(t) = \\begin{cases} \\exp(-1/t)  \\text{if } t > 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } t \\le 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nWe must establish that $h(t)$ is a smooth function, i.e., $h \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$. For $t0$, $h(t)$ is constant ($0$), so it is smooth. For $t>0$, $h(t) = \\exp(-1/t)$ is a composition of smooth functions, so it is smooth. The only point of concern is $t=0$. We must show that all derivatives of $h(t)$ exist at $t=0$ and are equal to $0$.\n\nWe can show by induction that for $t>0$, the $k$-th derivative of $h(t)$ has the form $h^{(k)}(t) = P_k(1/t) \\exp(-1/t)$ for some polynomial $P_k$.\nFor $k=0$, $h^{(0)}(t) = h(t) = 1 \\cdot \\exp(-1/t)$, so $P_0(y) = 1$.\nAssume the statement holds for some $k \\ge 0$. Then for $t>0$:\n$$\nh^{(k+1)}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( P_k(1/t) \\exp(-1/t) \\right) = P_k'(1/t) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right) \\exp(-1/t) + P_k(1/t) \\cdot \\exp(-1/t) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nh^{(k+1)}(t) = \\left( \\frac{1}{t^2} (P_k(1/t) - P_k'(1/t)) \\right) \\exp(-1/t)\n$$\nLetting $y=1/t$, the term in the parenthesis is a polynomial in $y$. Let $Q(y) = y^2(P_k(y) - P_k'(y))$. Then $h^{(k+1)}(t) = Q(1/t) \\exp(-1/t)$. This completes the induction.\n\nNow we show that $\\lim_{t \\to 0^+} h^{(k)}(t) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$. This is equivalent to showing $\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} P_k(y) \\exp(-y) = 0$. Since the exponential function grows faster than any polynomial, this limit is indeed $0$. By the definition of the derivative, $h^{(k)}(0) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{h^{(k-1)}(t) - h^{(k-1)}(0)}{t}$. Since the left-sided derivatives are all $0$ and we have shown the right-sided limits of all derivatives are $0$, we conclude that $h^{(k)}(0)=0$ for all $k \\ge 0$. Thus, $h \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\n**Step 1.2: The Smooth Step Function $g(t)$**\nUsing $h(t)$, we construct a function $g(t)$ that transitions smoothly from $0$ to $1$ over the interval $[0,1]$. Let\n$$\ng(t) = \\frac{h(t)}{h(t) + h(1-t)}\n$$\nThe denominator $h(t) + h(1-t)$ is never zero for any $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, because for it to be zero, both $h(t)$ and $h(1-t)$ must be zero, which would require $t \\le 0$ and $1-t \\le 0$ simultaneously. This implies $t \\le 0$ and $t \\ge 1$, which is impossible. Since $h$ is smooth and the denominator is never zero, $g(t)$ is a smooth function, $g \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$.\nThe properties of $g(t)$ are:\n- If $t \\le 0$, $h(t)=0$, so $g(t) = 0$.\n- If $t \\ge 1$, $h(1-t)=0$, so $g(t) = \\frac{h(t)}{h(t)} = 1$.\n- If $0  t  1$, $0  g(t)  1$.\n\n**Step 1.3: The Final Function $f(x)$**\nThe problem requires a radially symmetric function. We want $f(x)$ to be $1$ for $|x| \\le 1/2$ and to be $0$ for $|x|$ large enough so that its support is contained in $B(0,1)$. We can choose the transition to occur in the radial interval $[1/2, 3/4]$.\n\nLet's define a normalized radial variable $t$:\n$$\nt(r) = \\frac{r - 1/2}{3/4 - 1/2} = \\frac{r - 1/2}{1/4} = 4r - 2\n$$\nWhen $r = |x| = 1/2$, $t=0$. When $r = |x| = 3/4$, $t=1$.\nWe define our function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as:\n$$\nf(x) = 1 - g(4|x| - 2)\n$$\nLet's verify its properties:\n- If $|x| \\le 1/2$, then $4|x| - 2 \\le 0$. Thus $g(4|x| - 2) = 0$, and $f(x) = 1 - 0 = 1$. This satisfies the condition that $f(x) \\equiv 1$ on $B(0,1/2)$ (and on its closure).\n- If $|x| \\ge 3/4$, then $4|x| - 2 \\ge 1$. Thus $g(4|x| - 2) = 1$, and $f(x) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n- If $1/2  |x|  3/4$, then $0  4|x| - 2  1$. Thus $0  g(4|x| - 2)  1$, which implies $0  f(x)  1$.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is $C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. For any $x \\neq 0$, $|x|$ is a smooth function of $x$. Since $g$ is smooth, their composition $f(x)$ is smooth. At $x=0$, we have $|x|  1/2$, so $f(x)$ is locally constant (equal to $1$) in a neighborhood of the origin. A constant function is smooth. Therefore, $f \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.\n\n**Part 2: The Support of $f$**\n\nThe support of a function, denoted $\\operatorname{supp} f$, is defined as the closure of the set of points where the function is non-zero:\n$$\n\\operatorname{supp} f = \\overline{\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid f(x) \\neq 0\\}}\n$$\nFrom our construction of $f(x)$:\n- $f(x) = 0$ if and only if $g(4|x|-2) = 1$. This occurs when $4|x|-2 \\ge 1$, which is equivalent to $4|x| \\ge 3$, or $|x| \\ge 3/4$.\n- $f(x) \\neq 0$ if and only if $|x|  3/4$.\nSo, the set where $f(x)$ is non-zero is precisely the open ball of radius $3/4$ centered at the origin:\n$$\n\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid f(x) \\neq 0\\} = B(0, 3/4) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid |x|  3/4\\}\n$$\nThe support is the closure of this set:\n$$\n\\operatorname{supp} f = \\overline{B(0, 3/4)} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid |x| \\le 3/4\\}\n$$\nThis set is the closed $n$-dimensional ball of radius $R = 3/4$ centered at the origin. Geometrically, this is a closed interval for $n=1$, a closed disk for $n=2$, a solid sphere for $n=3$, and a solid $n$-hyperball in general.\n\nThe problem requires $\\operatorname{supp} f \\subset B(0,1)$. Our support is $\\overline{B(0, 3/4)}$. For any point $x \\in \\overline{B(0, 3/4)}$, we have $|x| \\le 3/4$. Since $3/4  1$, it follows that $|x|  1$, which means $x \\in B(0,1)$. Thus, the condition $\\overline{B(0, 3/4)} \\subset B(0,1)$ is satisfied.\n\n**Part 3: Lebesgue Measure of the Support**\n\nWe need to compute the $n$-dimensional Lebesgue measure, $\\lambda_n$, of $\\operatorname{supp} f = \\overline{B(0, 3/4)}$. The Lebesgue measure of a closed ball is the same as that of the corresponding open ball, which is its volume. The volume of an $n$-dimensional ball of radius $R$ is given by the well-known formula:\n$$\nV_n(R) = \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2} + 1)} R^n\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.\n\nFor our case, the radius is $R = 3/4$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n$$\n\\lambda_n(\\operatorname{supp} f) = V_n(3/4) = \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2} + 1)} \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^n\n$$\nThis is the required exact, closed-form analytic expression for the measure of the support of our constructed function $f$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)} \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^n}$$", "id": "3058989"}, {"introduction": "Partitions of unity are not just an elegant construction; they are a powerful tool for solving concrete problems.

The first integral, $I_{1}$, involves a function $\\chi f$ with support near the origin, thus containing the singularity of $\\ln|x|$. The second integral, $I_{2}$, involves a function $\\psi f$ whose support is away from the origin, thus avoiding the singularity.\n\nLet's analyze the second integral, $I_{2}$. The integrand is $\\ln|x| \\Delta(\\psi f)(x)$. The support of the function $\\psi f$ is contained in $\\mathrm{supp}(\\psi)$. We are given that $\\mathrm{supp}(\\psi) \\subset U_{2} = \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\overline{B(0,1)}$. This means that for any $x$ in the domain of integration of $I_{2}$, we have $|x| \\ge 1$. In this region, the function $x \\mapsto \\ln|x|$ is smooth ($C^{\\infty}$). The function $\\psi f$ is smooth and has compact support. Let $g(x) := (\\psi f)(x)$. Then $I_{2} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\ln|x| \\Delta g(x) dx$. We can use Green's Second Identity, which states that for smooth functions $u$ and $v$ where at least one has compact support, $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} (u \\Delta v - v \\Delta u) dx = 0$. Let $u(x) = \\ln|x|$ and $v(x) = g(x)$. Then,\n$$\nI_{2} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}} g(x) \\Delta(\\ln|x|) \\, dx.\n$$\nWe compute the Laplacian of $\\ln|x|$ for $x \\neq 0$. Let $r = |x| = \\sqrt{x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}}$. Then $\\ln|x| = \\ln r$. The gradient is $\\nabla(\\ln r) = \\frac{x}{r^{2}}$. The Laplacian is $\\Delta(\\ln r) = \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla(\\ln r) = \\nabla \\cdot (\\frac{x}{r^2})$. In Cartesian coordinates,\n$$\n\\Delta(\\ln r) = \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x_{1}^{2}}(\\ln r) + \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x_{2}^{2}}(\\ln r) = \\frac{r^{2} - 2x_{1}^{2}}{r^{4}} + \\frac{r^{2} - 2x_{2}^{2}}{r^{4}} = \\frac{2r^{2} - 2(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2})}{r^{4}} = \\frac{2r^{2}-2r^{2}}{r^{4}} = 0.\n$$\nSince the support of $g(x)=\\psi f(x)$ is contained in the region where $|x|\\ge 1$, the origin $x=0$ is excluded. Thus, $\\Delta(\\ln|x|)=0$ everywhere on the support of the integrand of $I_{2}$. Consequently,\n$$\nI_{2} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}} g(x) \\cdot 0 \\, dx = 0.\n$$\n\nNow we focus on the first integral, $I_{1} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}} \\ln|x| \\, \\Delta(\\chi f)(x) \\, dx$. Let $h(x) := (\\chi f)(x)$. The function $h(x)$ is smooth and has compact support contained in $\\mathrm{supp}(\\chi) \\subset B(0,2)$. The singularity of $\\ln|x|$ at $x=0$ lies within the support of $h(x)$, since $\\chi \\equiv 1$ on $B(0,1)$. To evaluate $I_{1}$, we must regularize the integral by excising a small ball of radius $\\varepsilon > 0$ around the origin. Let $D_{\\varepsilon} = B(0,R) \\setminus \\overline{B(0,\\varepsilon)}$, where $R=2$ so that $\\mathrm{supp}(h) \\subset B(0,2)$. Then,\n$$\nI_{1} = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\int_{D_{\\varepsilon}} \\ln|x| \\, \\Delta h(x) \\, dx.\n$$\nWe apply Green's Second Identity on the domain $D_{\\varepsilon}$ to the functions $u(x)=\\ln|x|$ and $v(x)=h(x)$. On $D_{\\varepsilon}$, $\\Delta u = \\Delta(\\ln|x|) = 0$.\n$$\n\\int_{D_{\\varepsilon}} u \\Delta v \\, dx = \\int_{\\partial D_{\\varepsilon}} (u \\nabla v - v \\nabla u) \\cdot n \\, dS,\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary $\\partial D_{\\varepsilon}$. The boundary consists of two parts: $\\partial B(0,2)$ and $\\partial B(0,\\varepsilon)$.\nThe support of $h(x)$ is contained strictly within $B(0,2)$, so $h$ and its derivatives are zero on $\\partial B(0,2)$. Therefore, the boundary integral over $\\partial B(0,2)$ vanishes.\nWe are left with the integral over $\\partial B(0,\\varepsilon)$. On this boundary, the outward normal vector from $D_{\\varepsilon}$ points towards the origin, so $n = -x/|x| = -x/\\varepsilon$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{D_{\\varepsilon}} \\ln|x| \\Delta h(x) \\, dx = \\int_{\\partial B(0,\\varepsilon)} (\\ln|x| \\nabla h(x) - h(x) \\nabla\\ln|x|) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{x}{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\, dS \\\\\n= -\\int_{\\partial B(0,\\varepsilon)} \\ln(\\varepsilon) (\\nabla h(x) \\cdot \\frac{x}{\\varepsilon}) \\, dS + \\int_{\\partial B(0,\\varepsilon)} h(x) (\\nabla\\ln|x| \\cdot \\frac{x}{\\varepsilon}) \\, dS.\n\\end{align*}\nLet's analyze these two terms in the limit $\\varepsilon \\to 0$.\nFor the first term, since $h(x)$ is smooth, its gradient $\\nabla h(x)$ is bounded near the origin. Let $M$ be an upper bound for $|\\nabla h(x) \\cdot x/\\varepsilon|$ on $\\partial B(0,\\varepsilon)$. The magnitude of this term is bounded by $|\\ln(\\varepsilon)| \\cdot M \\cdot (2\\pi\\varepsilon)$, which is proportional to $\\varepsilon \\ln \\varepsilon$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, $\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\varepsilon \\ln \\varepsilon = 0$. So, the first term vanishes in the limit.\nFor the second term, we have $\\nabla\\ln|x| = \\nabla\\ln r = x/r^{2}$. On $\\partial B(0,\\varepsilon)$, $r=\\varepsilon$, so $\\nabla\\ln|x| = x/\\varepsilon^2$. The dot product is $\\nabla\\ln|x| \\cdot (x/\\varepsilon) = (x/\\varepsilon^2) \\cdot (x/\\varepsilon) = |x|^2/\\varepsilon^3 = \\varepsilon^2/\\varepsilon^3 = 1/\\varepsilon$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial B(0,\\varepsilon)} h(x) \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\, dS = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\int_{\\partial B(0,\\varepsilon)} h(x) \\, dS.\n$$\nBy the Mean Value Theorem for integrals, there exists a point $x_{\\varepsilon} \\in \\partial B(0,\\varepsilon)$ such that $\\int_{\\partial B(0,\\varepsilon)} h(x) \\, dS = h(x_{\\varepsilon}) \\cdot (\\text{length of } \\partial B(0,\\varepsilon)) = h(x_{\\varepsilon}) \\cdot 2\\pi\\varepsilon$.\nSo, the second term is $\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} (h(x_{\\varepsilon}) \\cdot 2\\pi\\varepsilon) = 2\\pi h(x_{\\varepsilon})$.\nAs $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, $x_{\\varepsilon} \\to 0$. Since $h(x)$ is continuous, $\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} h(x_{\\varepsilon}) = h(0)$.\nThe limit of the second term is $2\\pi h(0)$.\nWe calculate $h(0) = (\\chi f)(0) = \\chi(0)f(0)$. By definition, $\\chi(0)=1$ because $0 \\in B(0,1)$. Also, $f(0)=\\exp(-|0|^2)=1$. Thus, $h(0)=1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nTherefore, $I_{1} = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} (0 + 2\\pi h(x_{\\varepsilon})) = 2\\pi h(0) = 2\\pi$.\n\nFinally, we combine the results for $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$:\n$$\nI = I_{1} + I_{2} = 2\\pi + 0 = 2\\pi.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\pi}$$", "id": "3058995"}]}
