No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is a standard exercise in differential geometry concerning the construction of the manifold structure of complex projective space. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ be the complex projective space of dimension $n$, defined as the set of all $1$-dimensional complex linear subspaces in $\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. An equivalent definition is the quotient space $(\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}\\setminus\\{0\\})/\\sim$, where the equivalence relation $\\sim$ is given by $w \\sim v$ if and only if there exists a non-zero complex number $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{\\times} = \\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ such that $w = \\lambda v$. An element of $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ is an equivalence class $[w]$, where $w = (w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_n) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n+1}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ are the homogeneous coordinates.\n\nTo establish that $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ is a smooth manifold, we construct a smooth atlas, which is a collection of charts $\\{(U_j, \\phi_j)\\}$ that cover $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ and whose transition maps are smooth.\n\nFor each index $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, let $U_j$ be the set of equivalence classes $[w]$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ such that the $j$-th homogeneous coordinate $w_j$ is non-zero.\n$$U_j = \\{[w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_n] \\in \\mathbb{CP}^{n} \\mid w_j \\neq 0\\}$$\nThis definition is independent of the choice of representative, since if $w_j \\neq 0$ and $v = \\lambda w$ for some $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{\\times}$, then $v_j = \\lambda w_j \\neq 0$. The collection of sets $\\{U_j\\}_{j=0}^{n}$ forms an open cover of $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$. They are open by the definition of the quotient topology, as their preimages under the quotient map $\\pi: \\mathbb{C}^{n+1}\\setminus\\{0\\} \\to \\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ are open sets. They form a cover because any point $w \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n+1}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ must have at least one non-zero coordinate, so every class $[w]$ belongs to at least one $U_j$.\n\nNext, we define a chart map $\\phi_j: U_j \\to \\mathbb{C}^n$ for each $j$. For any $[w] \\in U_j$, we know $w_j \\neq 0$. We can use the freedom in choosing a representative to select a unique one whose $j$-th coordinate is $1$. Specifically, the representative is $w' = (1/w_j)w$:\n$$w' = \\left(\\frac{w_0}{w_j}, \\dots, \\frac{w_{j-1}}{w_j}, 1, \\frac{w_{j+1}}{w_j}, \\dots, \\frac{w_n}{w_j}\\right)$$\nThe chart map $\\phi_j$ is defined by taking the $n$ coordinates of this unique representative that are not fixed to $1$:\n$$\\phi_j([w]) = \\left(\\frac{w_0}{w_j}, \\dots, \\frac{w_{j-1}}{w_j}, \\frac{w_{j+1}}{w_j}, \\dots, \\frac{w_n}{w_j}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{C}^n$$\nThis map is a bijection. Its inverse, $\\phi_j^{-1}: \\mathbb{C}^n \\to U_j$, is given by:\n$$\\phi_j^{-1}(z_0, \\dots, z_{j-1}, z_{j+1}, \\dots, z_n) = [z_0, \\dots, z_{j-1}, 1, z_{j+1}, \\dots, z_n]$$\nwhere the tuple of $z_i$ constitutes the coordinates in $\\mathbb{C}^n$. Both $\\phi_j$ and $\\phi_j^{-1}$ are continuous, making each $(U_j, \\phi_j)$ a valid chart.\n\nTo verify smoothness, we must analyze the transition maps $\\psi_{kj} = \\phi_k \\circ \\phi_j^{-1}$ on the overlaps $U_j \\cap U_k$ for $j \\neq k$. The domain of $\\psi_{kj}$ is $\\phi_j(U_j \\cap U_k)$. A point $[w]$ is in $U_j \\cap U_k$ if both $w_j \\neq 0$ and $w_k \\neq 0$.\nLet $\\boldsymbol{z}^{(j)} = (z_0, \\dots, \\widehat{z_j}, \\dots, z_n)$ be a point in the domain $\\phi_j(U_j \\cap U_k)$, where the hat denotes omission. Applying $\\phi_j^{-1}$ gives the point in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$:\n$$[w] = \\phi_j^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{z}^{(j)}) = [z_0, \\dots, z_{j-1}, 1, z_{j+1}, \\dots, z_n]$$\nHere, the homogeneous coordinates are $w_i = z_i$ for $i \\neq j$, and $w_j = 1$. The condition $[w] \\in U_k$ implies $w_k \\neq 0$, which for this representative means $z_k \\neq 0$. Thus, the domain of $\\psi_{kj}$ is the open subset of $\\mathbb{C}^n$ where the $k$-th component (among the $n$ coordinates) is non-zero.\n\nNow we apply $\\phi_k$ to $[w]$ to find the coordinates $\\boldsymbol{z}^{(k)} = (y_0, \\dots, \\widehat{y_k}, \\dots, y_n) = \\psi_{kj}(\\boldsymbol{z}^{(j)})$.\n$$\\boldsymbol{z}^{(k)} = \\phi_k([w]) = \\left(\\frac{w_0}{w_k}, \\dots, \\widehat{\\frac{w_k}{w_k}}, \\dots, \\frac{w_n}{w_k}\\right)$$\nThe components $y_i$ of $\\boldsymbol{z}^{(k)}$ are given by $y_i = w_i/w_k$ for $i \\neq k$. Substituting the expressions for $w_i$ in terms of $\\boldsymbol{z}^{(j)}$:\nFor $i \\neq j$ and $i \\neq k$: $y_i = \\frac{w_i}{w_k} = \\frac{z_i}{z_k}$.\nFor $i=j$: $y_j = \\frac{w_j}{w_k} = \\frac{1}{z_k}$.\nThese component functions are rational functions of the complex coordinates $\\boldsymbol{z}^{(j)}$. As such, they are holomorphic on their domain where $z_k \\neq 0$. A function that is holomorphic is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) when viewed as a map between real vector spaces. Therefore, the transition maps $\\psi_{kj}$ are smooth.\n\nThe collection of charts $\\{(U_j, \\phi_j)\\}_{j=0}^n$ constitutes a smooth atlas for $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$, which endows it with the structure of a smooth manifold.\n\nThe dimension of a manifold is the dimension of the Euclidean space to which its charts map. In our construction, each chart map $\\phi_j$ is a map from an open set $U_j \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ to the complex vector space $\\mathbb{C}^n$. The number of parameters is consistent across all charts.\nThe space $\\mathbb{C}^n$ consists of $n$-tuples of complex numbers $(z_1, \\dots, z_n)$. Each complex number $z_k$ can be written as $z_k = x_k + i y_k$, where $x_k$ and $y_k$ are real numbers. An ordered list of $n$ complex numbers is thus determined by $2n$ independent real parameters $(x_1, y_1, \\dots, x_n, y_n)$. This means that $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ as a real vector space.\nSince the charts for $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ are homeomorphisms to $\\mathbb{C}^n$, which is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, the real dimension of the manifold $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ is $2n$. This count of degrees of freedom is independent of the chosen chart.\n\nThe real dimension of $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ is therefore given by the analytic expression $2n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2n}$$", "id": "3047368"}, {"introduction": "While constructing an atlas from scratch is foundational, other powerful techniques can certify that a given set is a manifold.

Consider the linear map $R_{i}: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ which reflects a vector across the hyperplane defined by $y_i=0$. This map is given by:\n$R_{i}(y_1, \\dots, y_i, \\dots, y_{n+1}) = (y_1, \\dots, -y_i, \\dots, y_{n+1})$\nThis map is an isometry of the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ because it preserves the standard Euclidean norm:\n$\\|R_{i}(\\mathbf{y})\\|^2 = y_1^2 + \\dots + (-y_i)^2 + \\dots + y_{n+1}^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{n+1} y_j^2 = \\|\\mathbf{y}\\|^2$\nfor any vector $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\nSince $R_i$ preserves the norm, it maps the unit sphere $S^n = \\{\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \\|\\mathbf{y}\\| = 1\\}$ to itself. Let $\\phi: S^n \\to S^n$ be the restriction of $R_i$ to $S^n$. We will show that $\\phi$ is an isometry of the Riemannian manifold $(S^n, g)$, where $g$ is the induced metric.\n\nThe metric $g$ on $S^n$ is induced by the Euclidean inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}$ of the ambient space. An isometry is a diffeomorphism that preserves the metric. The map $\\phi$ is a diffeomorphism of $S^n$ onto itself; it is its own inverse, $\\phi \\circ \\phi = \\text{id}_{S^n}$. For $\\phi$ to be an isometry, it must satisfy $g_p(v,w) = g_{\\phi(p)}(d\\phi_p(v), d\\phi_p(w))$ for all $p \\in S^n$ and all tangent vectors $v,w \\in T_p S^n$. This is equivalent to showing that the pullback of the metric tensor by $\\phi$ is the metric tensor itself, i.e., $\\phi^*g = g$.\nSince $g$ is the restriction of the Euclidean inner product and $\\phi$ is the restriction of the linear isometry $R_i$, the differential $d\\phi_p$ is just the linear map $R_i$ acting on the tangent space $T_p S^n$. Since $R_i$ is an orthogonal transformation, it preserves the inner product: $\\langle R_i(v), R_i(w) \\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} = \\langle v, w \\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}$.

If $\\phi$ is an isometry of $(M, g)$, then for any measurable subset $A \\subset M$, the volume of $A$ is equal to the volume of its image, $\\mu(A) = \\mu(\\phi(A))$.

For any point $p = (y_1, \\dots, y_{n+1}) \\in S^n$, the function $x_i$ is defined by $x_i(p) = y_i$. The map $\\phi$ acts as:\n$\\phi(p) = R_i(p) = (y_1, \\dots, -y_i, \\dots, y_{n+1})$\nApplying the function $x_i$ to the point $\\phi(p)$ gives the $i$-th coordinate of $\\phi(p)$, which is $-y_i$.
