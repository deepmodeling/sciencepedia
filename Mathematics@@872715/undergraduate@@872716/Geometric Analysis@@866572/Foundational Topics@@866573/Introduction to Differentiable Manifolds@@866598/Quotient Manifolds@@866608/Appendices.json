We will address the four specified tasks sequentially to characterize the surface $M$ and compute its Euler characteristic, $\\chi(M)$.\n\n### 1. Justification as a Compact, Connected, Hausdorff 2-Manifold without Boundary\n\n**Compactness and Connectedness:**\nThe space $Q=[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ is a closed and bounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. By the Heine-Borel theorem, $Q$ is compact. The space $M=Q/\\sim$ is the image of $Q$ under the continuous quotient map $\\pi:Q\\to M$. Since the continuous image of a compact space is compact, $M$ is a compact topological space.\nSimilarly, $Q$ is path-connected and therefore connected. The continuous image of a connected space is connected, so $M$ is a connected topological space.\n\n**Manifold Structure:**\nTo demonstrate that $M$ is a $2$-dimensional topological manifold without boundary, we must show that every point $p \\in M$ possesses an open neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open disk in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Let $p = \\pi(q)$ for some $q \\in Q$. We consider three cases for the location of $q$:\n\n-   **Case 1: Interior points.** If $q$ lies in the interior of the square, $(0,1)\\times(0,1)$, then the equivalence class of $q$ is the singleton set $\\{q\\}$. The quotient map $\\pi$ is a homeomorphism on a sufficiently small open disk around $q$ contained entirely within the interior of $Q$. Thus, $p$ has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open disk.\n\n-   **Case 2: Edge points (not corners).** If $q$ lies on an edge but is not a vertex, its equivalence class consists of two points.\n    -   If $q_1 = (x_0, 0)$ for some $x_0 \\in (0,1)$, its equivalence class is $\\{q_1, q_2\\}$ where $q_2 = (x_0, 1)$. A neighborhood of $p=\\pi(q_1)$ in $M$ is formed by the image of two semi-disks in $Q$ centered at $q_1$ and $q_2$ respectively. When glued along their diameters by the identification, they form a neighborhood homeomorphic to a full open disk.\n    -   If $q_1 = (0, y_0)$ for some $y_0 \\in (0,1)$, its equivalence class is $\\{q_1, q_2\\}$ where $q_2 = (1, 1-y_0)$. A similar argument shows that gluing the neighborhoods of $q_1$ and $q_2$ results in a neighborhood of $p=\\pi(q_1)$ homeomorphic to an open disk.\n\n-   **Case 3: Corner points.** The four corners of the square are $v_1=(0,0)$, $v_2=(1,0)$, $v_3=(1,1)$, and $v_4=(0,1)$. We trace their identifications:\n    -   From $(x,0)\\sim(x,1)$: setting $x=0$ gives $(0,0)\\sim(0,1)$ ($v_1 \\sim v_4$), and setting $x=1$ gives $(1,0)\\sim(1,1)$ ($v_2 \\sim v_3$).\n    -   From $(0,y)\\sim(1,1-y)$: setting $y=0$ gives $(0,0)\\sim(1,1)$ ($v_1 \\sim v_3$), and setting $y=1$ gives $(0,1)\\sim(1,0)$ ($v_4 \\sim v_2$).\n    -   By transitivity, all four vertices are identified to a single point in $M$: $v_1 \\sim v_4 \\sim v_2 \\sim v_3$. A neighborhood of this single vertex point in $M$ is formed by gluing the four quarter-disks at each corner of $Q$. These four quarter-disks smoothly join to form a single neighborhood homeomorphic to an open disk.\n\nSince every point in $M$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open disk, $M$ is a $2$-dimensional topological manifold without boundary.\n\n**Hausdorff Property:**\nA topological manifold is, by definition, locally Euclidean and thus locally Hausdorff. A standard theorem in topology states that a compact, locally Hausdorff space is Hausdorff. Since we have already established that $M$ is compact and a manifold (hence locally Hausdorff), it follows that $M$ is a Hausdorff space.\n\n### 2. Orientability\n\nA surface is nonorientable if it contains a Möbius strip as a subspace. Let's analyze the effect of the identifications. The identification $(x,0)\\sim(x,1)$ glues the top and bottom edges of the square to form a cylinder. The second identification, $(0,y)\\sim(1,1-y)$, glues the two boundary circles of this cylinder. This second gluing involves a reversal of orientation.\n\nConsider a horizontal strip $S = [0,1] \\times [y_1, y_2]$ with $0 < y_1 < y_2 < 1$. The quotient space $\\pi(S)$ is formed by identifying the left edge $\\{0\\}\\times[y_1, y_2]$ with the right edge $\\{1\\}\\times[y_1, y_2]$ via the map $(0,y) \\mapsto (1,1-y)$. If we trace a path upward along the left edge from $(0,y_1)$ to $(0,y_2)$, the corresponding path on the right edge travels downward from $(1, 1-y_1)$ to $(1, 1-y_2)$. This orientation-reversing gluing of the ends of a rectangular strip is the definition of a Möbius strip. Since $M$ contains a Möbius strip, it is a nonorientable surface.\n\n### 3. Euler Characteristic\n\nThe Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$ can be computed using a cell decomposition of $M$ induced by the square $Q$ and its identifications, using the formula $\\chi(M) = V - E + F$, where $V$, $E$, and $F$ are the number of vertices ($0$-cells), edges ($1$-cells), and faces ($2$-cells) in the decomposition.\n\n-   **Faces (F):** The interior of the square $Q$ forms a single $2$-cell in $M$. Thus, $F=1$.\n-   **Edges (E):** The boundary of $Q$ consists of four edges. The identification $(x,0)\\sim(x,1)$ merges the top and bottom edges into a single $1$-cell in $M$. The identification $(0,y)\\sim(1,1-y)$ merges the left and right edges into a second $1$-cell in $M$. Thus, there are $E=2$ edges in the cell structure of $M$.\n-   **Vertices (V):** As established in Part 1, all four vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(1,1)$, and $(0,1)$ of the square are identified to a single point in $M$. Thus, there is $V=1$ vertex in the cell structure of $M$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the Euler characteristic:\n$$\n\\chi(M) = V - E + F = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0\n$$\n\n### 4. Surface Identification\n\nThe classification theorem for closed surfaces states that every compact, connected $2$-manifold without boundary is homeomorphic to exactly one surface from a standard list. The surface is uniquely determined by its orientability and Euler characteristic.\n\nWe have found that $M$ is a nonorientable surface with an Euler characteristic of $\\chi(M)=0$. The classification includes the family of nonorientable surfaces, which are the connected sums of $k$ real projective planes, denoted $P^k = \\underbrace{P^2 \\# \\dots \\# P^2}_{k \\text{ copies}}$. The Euler characteristic of such a surface is given by the formula $\\chi(P^k) = 2 - k$.\n\nTo identify $M$, we set its Euler characteristic equal to this formula:\n$$\n\\chi(M) = 2 - k = 0\n$$\nSolving for $k$ gives $k=2$. Therefore, $M$ is homeomorphic to the connected sum of two projective planes, $P^2 \\# P^2$. This surface is commonly known as the Klein bottle. This identification is consistent with the standard polygonal presentation of the Klein bottle, which uses the same edge identifications as those given for $M$.\nThe final required quantity is the Euler characteristic of $M$.\n$$\n\\chi(M)=0\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3060149"}, {"introduction": "A powerful method for constructing manifolds with a high degree of symmetry is to consider quotients of Lie groups, known as homogeneous spaces.

We use standard spherical coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi)$, where $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi)$ is the polar angle measured from the positive $z$-axis and $\\varphi \\in (0,2\\pi)$ is the azimuthal angle in the $xy$-plane from the positive $x$-axis.

A point with Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$ is given by:\n$$\nx = \\sin\\theta \\cos\\varphi\n$$\n$$\ny = \\sin\\theta \\sin\\varphi\n$$\n$$\nz = \\cos\\theta\n$$\nThus, the parametrization is given by the vector function:\n$$\nX(\\theta, \\varphi) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\varphi \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\sin\\varphi \\\\ \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Induced Metric and $\\lambda$**\n\nThe metric $g_{S^2}$ on the quotient manifold $S^2 \\simeq G/H$ is defined by the condition that the projection map $\\pi \\colon G \\to S^2$ is a Riemannian submersion. This means that for any point $p \\in S^2$ and any pair of tangent vectors $u, v \\in T_p S^2$, their inner product is given by\n$$\ng_{S^2}(u, v)_p = g_{G}(\\tilde{u}, \\tilde{v})_R\n$$\nwhere $R$ is any element in $G$ such that $\\pi(R) = p$, and $\\tilde{u}, \\tilde{v}$ are the unique horizontal lifts of $u, v$ to the tangent space $T_R G$. The horizontal space $\\mathcal{H}_R$ is the orthogonal complement of the vertical space $\\mathcal{V}_R = \\ker(d\\pi_R)$ with respect to the metric $g_G$.\n\nThe metric on $G=SO(3)$ is left-invariant, originating from the inner product $\\langle A, B \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{tr}(AB)$ on the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3) = T_e G$. The vertical space at the identity, $\\mathcal{V}_e$, is the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ of the subgroup $H=SO(2)$. The horizontal space at the identity, $\\mathcal{H}_e$, is the orthogonal complement of $\\mathfrak{h}$ in $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$. Due to the left-invariance of the metric, the horizontal space at any $R \\in G$ is $\\mathcal{H}_R = dL_R(\\mathcal{H}_e)$, where $L_R$ is left multiplication by $R$.\n\nThe differential of $\\pi$ at an element $R \\in G$ applied to a vector $Y = dL_R(A) \\in T_R G$ (for $A \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$) is $d\\pi_R(Y) = \\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} \\pi(R\\exp(tA)) = R(A e_3)$.\nA vector $Y=dL_R(A)$ is a horizontal lift of $u \\in T_p S^2$ if $A \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ and $d\\pi_R(Y) = u$. That is, $A \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ and $R A e_3 = u$.\nThe metric computation then simplifies to $g_{S^2}(u, v)_p = \\langle A_u, A_v \\rangle$, where $A_u, A_v \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ are such that $R A_u e_3 = u$ and $R A_v e_3 = v$ for any $R$ with $\\pi(R)=p$.\n\nLet's establish a basis for $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$. The standard basis for $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ consists of the infinitesimal generators of rotations about the coordinate axes:\n$$\nL_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad L_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad L_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$H=SO(2)$ is the group of rotations about the $z$-axis, so its Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{h} = \\operatorname{span}\\{L_3\\}$. This is the vertical subalgebra $\\mathcal{V}_e$.\nThe horizontal subalgebra $\\mathcal{H}_e$ is the orthogonal complement of $\\mathfrak{h}$. For any $A \\in \\mathfrak{h}$ and $B \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$, we must have $\\langle A, B \\rangle = 0$. The basis $\\{L_1, L_2, L_3\\}$ is orthonormal with respect to the given inner product:\n$$\n\\langle L_i, L_j \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(L_i L_j) = \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nFor instance, $\\langle L_1, L_1 \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(L_1^2) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\operatorname{diag}(0, -1, -1)\\right) = 1$. The orthogonality, e.g. $\\langle L_1, L_2 \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(L_1 L_2) = 0$, can be checked similarly.\nThus, $\\mathcal{H}_e = \\operatorname{span}\\{L_1, L_2\\}$.\n\nTo find $\\lambda$, we compute the metric components at a convenient, non-singular point. Let's choose the point $p = (1,0,0) \\in S^2$, which corresponds to coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi) = (\\pi/2, 0)$. The tangent vectors for the coordinate system at this point are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\theta}\\bigg|_{(\\pi/2, 0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\pi/2)\\cos(0) \\\\ \\cos(\\pi/2)\\sin(0) \\\\ -\\sin(\\pi/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -e_3\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\varphi}\\bigg|_{(\\pi/2, 0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin(0) \\\\ \\sin(\\pi/2)\\cos(0) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = e_2\n$$\nThe metric components are $g_{\\theta\\theta} = g_{S^2}(-e_3, -e_3)_p$, $g_{\\varphi\\varphi} = g_{S^2}(e_2, e_2)_p$, and $g_{\\theta\\varphi} = g_{S^2}(-e_3, e_2)_p$.\n\nWe need an $R \\in SO(3)$ such that $\\pi(R) = R e_3 = p = e_1$. A rotation by $\\pi/2$ about the $y$-axis works:\n$$\nR = R_y(\\pi/2) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\pi/2) & 0 & \\sin(\\pi/2) \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\sin(\\pi/2) & 0 & \\cos(\\pi/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIndeed, $R e_3 = (1,0,0)^T = e_1 = p$.\n\nNow we find the horizontal pre-images in $\\mathcal{H}_e = \\operatorname{span}\\{L_1, L_2\\}$ for our tangent vectors.\nFor $u = -e_3$, we seek $A \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ such that $R A e_3 = -e_3$. Let $A = c_1 L_1 + c_2 L_2$.\n$A e_3 = c_1(L_1 e_3) + c_2(L_2 e_3) = c_1(-e_2) + c_2(e_1) = (c_2, -c_1, 0)^T$.\n$R(A e_3) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_2 \\\\ -c_1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -c_1 \\\\ -c_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe set this equal to $-e_3 = (0,0,-1)^T$, which gives $-c_1 = 0$ and $-c_2 = -1$, so $c_1=0, c_2=1$. The pre-image is $A = L_2$.\nThe metric component is $g_{\\theta\\theta} = \\langle A, A \\rangle = \\langle L_2, L_2 \\rangle = 1$.\n\nFor $v = e_2$, we seek $B \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ such that $R B e_3 = e_2$. Let $B = d_1 L_1 + d_2 L_2$.\n$R(B e_3) = (0, -d_1, -d_2)^T$.\nWe set this equal to $e_2 = (0,1,0)^T$, which gives $-d_1 = 1$ and $-d_2=0$, so $d_1=-1, d_2=0$. The pre-image is $B = -L_1$.\nThe metric component is $g_{\\varphi\\varphi} = \\langle B, B \\rangle = \\langle -L_1, -L_1 \\rangle = \\langle L_1, L_1 \\rangle = 1$.\n\nThe off-diagonal component is $g_{\\theta\\varphi} = \\langle A, B \\rangle = \\langle L_2, -L_1 \\rangle = -\\langle L_2, L_1 \\rangle = 0$ due to orthogonality.\n\nSo at $(\\theta, \\varphi) = (\\pi/2, 0)$, the metric is $ds^2 = g_{\\theta\\theta}d\\theta^2 + g_{\\varphi\\varphi}d\\varphi^2 = 1 \\cdot d\\theta^2 + 1 \\cdot d\\varphi^2$.\nWe compare this to the asserted general form $g = \\lambda (d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\varphi^2)$. At $\\theta = \\pi/2$, $\\sin\\theta = 1$, so this form becomes $g = \\lambda (d\\theta^2 + d\\varphi^2)$.\nComparing our computed metric with this expression, we find $1 \\cdot (d\\theta^2 + d\\varphi^2) = \\lambda (d\\theta^2 + d\\varphi^2)$, which implies $\\lambda=1$.\nSince the metric on $SO(3)$ is bi-invariant and the action of $SO(3)$ on $S^2$ is transitive, the induced metric is $SO(3)$-invariant. The unique (up to scaling) $SO(3)$-invariant metric on $S^2$ is the standard round metric. Therefore, the constant $\\lambda$ determined at one point is valid for the entire sphere. The specific normalization $\\langle A, B \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(AB)$ on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is precisely what yields the standard unit sphere metric on $S^2$, for which $\\lambda=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3060085"}, {"introduction": "The structure of a quotient manifold has profound consequences for analysis, particularly for the solutions of differential equations defined on it.

Applying the periodicity condition:\n$$\nC \\exp(i\\omega_j(x_j+1)) = C \\exp(i\\omega_j x_j)\n$$\nAssuming $C \\neq 0$ for a non-trivial solution, we can divide to get:\n$$\n\\exp(i\\omega_j x_j) \\exp(i\\omega_j) = \\exp(i\\omega_j x_j)\n$$\nThis implies $\\exp(i\\omega_j) = 1$. From Euler's formula, $\\exp(i\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)$, the condition $\\exp(i\\omega_j) = 1$ is satisfied if and only if $\\omega_j$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. That is:\n$$\n\\omega_j = 2\\pi k_j \\quad \\text{for some integer } k_j \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nThis includes the case $k_j=0$, which corresponds to $\\omega_j=0$ and a constant solution $X_j(x_j) = C$.\nThe separation constants $\\lambda_j$ are therefore quantized:\n$$\n\\lambda_j = \\omega_j^2 = (2\\pi k_j)^2 = 4\\pi^2 k_j^2\n$$\nThe eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is indexed by the vector of integers $k = (k_1, \\dots, k_n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$ is the sum of the corresponding $\\lambda_j$:\n$$\n\\lambda_k = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\lambda_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} 4\\pi^2 k_j^2\n$$\nThis can be factored to give the general closed-form expression for the eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\lambda_k = 4\\pi^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k_j^2\n$$\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are of the form $u_k(x) = \\exp(i 2\\pi k \\cdot x) = \\exp\\left(i 2\\pi \\sum_{j=1}^n k_j x_j\\right)$. The set of these eigenfunctions for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ forms a complete basis of $L^2(T^n)$, confirming that we have found all the eigenvalues of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on the flat torus.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4\\pi^{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k_{j}^{2}}\n$$", "id": "3060126"}]}
