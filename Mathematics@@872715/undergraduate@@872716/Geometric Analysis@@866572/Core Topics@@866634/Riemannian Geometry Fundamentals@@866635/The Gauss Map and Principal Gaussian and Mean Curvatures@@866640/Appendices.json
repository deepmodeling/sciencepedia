So the point on the surface is the origin, $P=(0,0,0)$.\n\nNext, we verify that $(0,0)$ is a critical point of $f$.

Since $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236  3$, both $\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2$ are positive. This confirms that $P$ is an elliptic point.\nThe sign of $K$ is given by $K = \\kappa_1 \\kappa_2 = (3+\\sqrt{5})(3-\\sqrt{5}) = 9-5=4$. Since both principal curvatures are positive, their product $K$ is positive. At an elliptic point, the surface is locally dome-like or bowl-like, lying entirely on one side of its tangent plane.\nThe sign of $H$ is determined by $H = \\frac{1}{2}(\\kappa_1 + \\kappa_2) = \\frac{1}{2}((3+\\sqrt{5})+(3-\\sqrt{5})) = 3$. Since both principal curvatures are positive, their average $H$ is also positive. This indicates that the surface is, on average, curving in the direction of the normal vector $N$. Since $N$ points in the positive $z$-direction at $P$, a positive mean curvature implies the surface is shaped like a bowl opening upwards, which corresponds to a local minimum of the function $f(x,y)$. The second derivative test for $f$ at $(0,0)$ confirms this: $D = f_{xx}f_{yy}-f_{xy}^2 = K = 4 > 0$ and $f_{xx}=4>0$, indicating a local minimum.\n\nThe final computed values for the ordered pair $(H,K)$ at $P$ are $(3,4)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3  4 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3069493"}, {"introduction": "How does the curvature of an object change if we simply scale it to be larger or smaller?

All quantities for the scaled surface will be denoted with a subscript $\\lambda$.\n\nFirst, we compute the tangent vectors for $S_{\\lambda}$ by differentiating $X_{\\lambda}$ with respect to the parameters $u$ and $v$:\n$$\nX_{\\lambda, u} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(\\lambda X) = \\lambda \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial u} = \\lambda X_{u}\n$$\n$$\nX_{\\lambda, v} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}(\\lambda X) = \\lambda \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial v} = \\lambda X_{v}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form of $S_{\\lambda}$, denoted $E_{\\lambda}$, $F_{\\lambda}$, and $G_{\\lambda}$. These are defined by the inner products of the tangent vectors.\n$$\nE_{\\lambda} = \\langle X_{\\lambda, u}, X_{\\lambda, u} \\rangle = \\langle \\lambda X_{u}, \\lambda X_{u} \\rangle = \\lambda^{2} \\langle X_{u}, X_{u} \\rangle = \\lambda^{2} E\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\lambda} = \\langle X_{\\lambda, u}, X_{\\lambda, v} \\rangle = \\langle \\lambda X_{u}, \\lambda X_{v} \\rangle = \\lambda^{2} \\langle X_{u}, X_{v} \\rangle = \\lambda^{2} F\n$$\n$$\nG_{\\lambda} = \\langle X_{\\lambda, v}, X_{\\lambda, v} \\rangle = \\langle \\lambda X_{v}, \\lambda X_{v} \\rangle = \\lambda^{2} \\langle X_{v}, X_{v} \\rangle = \\lambda^{2} G\n$$\nThe matrix of the first fundamental form for $S_{\\lambda}$ is $\\mathcal{I}_{\\lambda} = \\begin{pmatrix} E_{\\lambda}  F_{\\lambda} \\\\ F_{\\lambda}  G_{\\lambda} \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda^{2} \\begin{pmatrix} E  F \\\\ F  G \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda^{2} \\mathcal{I}$.\n\nNow, we determine the unit normal vector $N_{\\lambda}$ for the scaled surface.\n$$\nX_{\\lambda, u} \\times X_{\\lambda, v} = (\\lambda X_{u}) \\times (\\lambda X_{v}) = \\lambda^{2} (X_{u} \\times X_{v})\n$$\nThe magnitude is $|X_{\\lambda, u} \\times X_{\\lambda, v}| = |\\lambda^{2} (X_{u} \\times X_{v})| = \\lambda^{2} |X_{u} \\times X_{v}|$ since $\\lambda  0$.\nThe unit normal vector is therefore:\n$$\nN_{\\lambda} = \\frac{X_{\\lambda, u} \\times X_{\\lambda, v}}{|X_{\\lambda, u} \\times X_{\\lambda, v}|} = \\frac{\\lambda^{2} (X_{u} \\times X_{v})}{\\lambda^{2} |X_{u} \\times X_{v}|} = \\frac{X_{u} \\times X_{v}}{|X_{u} \\times X_{v}|} = N\n$$\nThe unit normal vector is invariant under the homothety.\n\nNext, we compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form of $S_{\\lambda}$, denoted $e_{\\lambda}$, $f_{\\lambda}$, and $g_{\\lambda}$. We first need the second partial derivatives of $X_{\\lambda}$:\n$$\nX_{\\lambda, uu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} (\\lambda X_{u}) = \\lambda X_{uu}\n$$\n$$\nX_{\\lambda, uv} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} (\\lambda X_{u}) = \\lambda X_{uv}\n$$\n$$\nX_{\\lambda, vv} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} (\\lambda X_{v}) = \\lambda X_{vv}\n$$\nUsing these and the fact that $N_{\\lambda} = N$, we find the coefficients:\n$$\ne_{\\lambda} = \\langle X_{\\lambda, uu}, N_{\\lambda} \\rangle = \\langle \\lambda X_{uu}, N \\rangle = \\lambda \\langle X_{uu}, N \\rangle = \\lambda e\n$$\n$$\nf_{\\lambda} = \\langle X_{\\lambda, uv}, N_{\\lambda} \\rangle = \\langle \\lambda X_{uv}, N \\rangle = \\lambda \\langle X_{uv}, N \\rangle = \\lambda f\n$$\n$$\ng_{\\lambda} = \\langle X_{\\lambda, vv}, N_{\\lambda} \\rangle = \\langle \\lambda X_{vv}, N \\rangle = \\lambda \\langle X_{vv}, N \\rangle = \\lambda g\n$$\nThe matrix of the second fundamental form for $S_{\\lambda}$ is $\\mathcal{II}_{\\lambda} = \\begin{pmatrix} e_{\\lambda}  f_{\\lambda} \\\\ f_{\\lambda}  g_{\\lambda} \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} e  f \\\\ f  g \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda \\mathcal{II}$.\n\nThe shape operator $S$ is a linear map on the tangent space. Its matrix representation $W$ in the basis $\\{X_u, X_v\\}$ is given by $W = \\mathcal{I}^{-1}\\mathcal{II}$. Similarly, the matrix representation $W_{\\lambda}$ of the shape operator $S_{\\lambda}$ in the basis $\\{X_{\\lambda,u}, X_{\\lambda,v}\\}$ is given by:\n$$\nW_{\\lambda} = \\mathcal{I}_{\\lambda}^{-1} \\mathcal{II}_{\\lambda} = (\\lambda^{2} \\mathcal{I})^{-1} (\\lambda \\mathcal{II}) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^{2}} \\mathcal{I}^{-1} \\lambda \\mathcal{II} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} (\\mathcal{I}^{-1} \\mathcal{II}) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} W\n$$\nThe principal curvatures $k_1, k_2$ of $S$ are the eigenvalues of the matrix $W$. The principal curvatures $k_{1,\\lambda}, k_{2,\\lambda}$ of $S_{\\lambda}$ are the eigenvalues of the matrix $W_{\\lambda}$. If $v$ is an eigenvector of $W$ with eigenvalue $k$, i.e., $Wv = kv$, then for $W_{\\lambda}$ we have:\n$$\nW_{\\lambda} v = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda} W\\right) v = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} (Wv) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} (kv) = \\left(\\frac{k}{\\lambda}\\right) v\n$$\nThis shows that the eigenvalues of $W_{\\lambda}$ are the eigenvalues of $W$ divided by $\\lambda$. Thus, the principal curvatures of the scaled surface are:\n$$\nk_{1,\\lambda} = \\frac{k_{1}}{\\lambda} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k_{2,\\lambda} = \\frac{k_{2}}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nFrom this result, we can deduce the scaling laws for the mean and Gaussian curvatures.\nThe mean curvature $H_{\\lambda}$ of $S_{\\lambda}$ is:\n$$\nH_{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2}(k_{1,\\lambda} + k_{2,\\lambda}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{\\lambda} + \\frac{k_{2}}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(k_{1} + k_{2})\\right) = \\frac{H}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe Gaussian curvature $K_{\\lambda}$ of $S_{\\lambda}$ is:\n$$\nK_{\\lambda} = k_{1,\\lambda} k_{2,\\lambda} = \\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{\\lambda}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_{2}}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{k_{1} k_{2}}{\\lambda^{2}} = \\frac{K}{\\lambda^{2}}\n$$\n\nIn summary, under a homothety with factor $\\lambda$, the principal curvatures and the mean curvature are scaled by a factor of $1/\\lambda$, while the Gaussian curvature is scaled by a factor of $1/\\lambda^{2}$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing $(k_{1,\\lambda}, k_{2,\\lambda}, H_{\\lambda}, K_{\\lambda})$ expressed in terms of the original curvatures and $\\lambda$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{k_{1}}{\\lambda}  \\frac{k_{2}}{\\lambda}  \\frac{H}{\\lambda}  \\frac{K}{\\lambda^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3069506"}]}
