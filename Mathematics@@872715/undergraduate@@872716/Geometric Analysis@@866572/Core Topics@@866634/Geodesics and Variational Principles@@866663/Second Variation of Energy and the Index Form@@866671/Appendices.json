The problem is well-posed, with a clear sequence of tasks leading to a unique and meaningful numerical answer. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. It is a canonical example within the topic of the second variation of energy and the index form, for which Jacobi fields are the central object of study. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by deriving and solving the Jacobi equation under the specified conditions.\n\n1.  **Derivation of the Jacobi Equation**\n    The general form of the Jacobi equation for a vector field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is\n    $$\n    \\nabla_t^2 J(t) + R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0\n    $$\n    where $\\nabla_t$ denotes the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ (i.e., $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$), and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n\n    In $\\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with the standard Euclidean metric, the geometric structures simplify considerably.\n    First, the problem states that the Riemann curvature tensor is zero. This is a fundamental property of flat spaces like $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Consequently, the curvature term in the Jacobi equation vanishes:\n    $$\n    R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0\n    $$\n    Second, the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ in Euclidean space is simply the standard directional derivative of vector fields. For a vector field $J(t)$ defined along a curve $\\gamma(t)$, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_t J(t)$ is the ordinary component-wise derivative of $J$ with respect to the parameter $t$.\n    $$\n    \\nabla_t J(t) = J'(t) = \\frac{dJ(t)}{dt}\n    $$\n    The second covariant derivative is therefore the second ordinary derivative:\n    $$\n    \\nabla_t^2 J(t) = \\nabla_t (\\nabla_t J(t)) = \\nabla_t (J'(t)) = J''(t) = \\frac{d^2J(t)}{dt^2}\n    $$\n    Substituting these simplifications into the general Jacobi equation, we obtain the specific form for Euclidean space:\n    $$\n    J''(t) + 0 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad J''(t) = 0\n    $$\n\n2.  **General Solution of the Jacobi Equation**\n    We need to solve the second-order vector ordinary differential equation $J''(t) = 0$, where $J(t)$ is a vector-valued function in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We can integrate this equation twice with respect to $t$.\n    Integrating once gives:\n    $$\n    J'(t) = A\n    $$\n    where $A$ is a constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n    Integrating a second time gives:\n    $$\n    J(t) = At + B\n    $$\n    where $B$ is another constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Thus, any Jacobi field along a geodesic in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ must be a linear function of the parameter $t$. The vectors $A$ and $B$ are determined by initial conditions. Any such linear field is a Jacobi field, which can be seen by considering the variation of geodesics $c_s(t) = \\gamma(t) + s(At+B)$.\n\n3.  **Imposition of Boundary Conditions**\n    The problem asks for Jacobi fields that satisfy the boundary conditions $J(0)=0$ and $J(1)=0$. We apply these to the general solution $J(t) = At + B$.\n    Applying the first condition, $J(0)=0$:\n    $$\n    J(0) = A \\cdot 0 + B = B\n    $$\n    So, we must have $B=0$. The Jacobi field is now of the form $J(t) = At$.\n    Applying the second condition, $J(1)=0$:\n    $$\n    J(1) = A \\cdot 1 = A\n    $$\n    So, we must have $A=0$.\n    Since both constant vectors $A$ and $B$ must be the zero vector, the only Jacobi field that satisfies $J(0)=0$ and $J(1)=0$ is the trivial Jacobi field, $J(t) = 0$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\n4.  **Absence of Conjugate Points**\n    A point $\\gamma(t_1)$ for $t_10$ is defined as being conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ along the geodesic $\\gamma$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ (i.e., $J(t)$ is not identically zero) along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_1)=0$.\n    Let's check this condition for any $t_1 \\in (0,1]$. We require a non-trivial solution to $J(t)=At+B$ with $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_1)=0$.\n    The condition $J(0)=0$ implies $B=0$, so $J(t)=At$.\n    The condition $J(t_1)=0$ implies $At_1=0$. Since $t_1  0$, we can divide by $t_1$ to find $A=0$.\n    Thus, $A=0$ and $B=0$, which means $J(t)=0$ for all $t$. This is the trivial Jacobi field.\n    Since no non-trivial Jacobi field exists that vanishes at both $t=0$ and $t=t_1$ for any $t_10$, we conclude that there are no points conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma$. This is a characteristic feature of flat manifolds.\n\n5.  **Dimension of the Solution Space**\n    The final task is to determine the dimension of the $\\mathbb{R}$-vector space of Jacobi fields along $\\gamma$ that satisfy $J(0)=0$ and $J(1)=0$. As demonstrated in part 3, the only solution under these boundary conditions is the zero vector field, $J(t)=0$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\n    The set of all such solutions is $\\{0\\}$, the trivial vector space containing only the zero element.\n    By definition, the dimension of the trivial vector space $\\{0\\}$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3061442"}, {"introduction": "Having seen that geodesics in flat space do not refocus, we now turn to the canonical example of a positively curved manifold: the unit sphere $S^n$.

The manifold is the unit $n$-sphere $S^n$, which has constant sectional curvature $K=+1$. The variation vector field is $V(t) = \\sin(\\pi t) E(t)$, where $E(t)$ is a parallel vector field ($D_t E(t)=0$) along the unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ ($|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)|=1$), and $E(t)$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ ($\\langle E(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$) and has unit length ($|E(t)|=1$).\n\nFirst, we compute the term $\\langle D_t V, D_t V \\rangle$:\n$D_t V(t) = D_t (\\sin(\\pi t) E(t)) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\sin(\\pi t)) E(t) + \\sin(\\pi t) D_t E(t)$.\nSince $D_t E(t) = 0$, we have $D_t V(t) = \\pi\\cos(\\pi t) E(t)$.\nThe inner product is:\n$$ \\langle D_t V, D_t V \\rangle = \\langle \\pi\\cos(\\pi t) E(t), \\pi\\cos(\\pi t) E(t) \\rangle = \\pi^2\\cos^2(\\pi t) \\langle E(t), E(t) \\rangle = \\pi^2\\cos^2(\\pi t) |E(t)|^2 $$\nGiven $|E(t)|=1$, this simplifies to $\\langle D_t V, D_t V \\rangle = \\pi^2\\cos^2(\\pi t)$.\n\nNext, we compute the curvature term $\\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle$. For a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Riemann tensor is given by $R(X,Y)Z = K(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y)$. In our case, $K=+1$, $X=V(t)$, $Y=\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, and $Z=\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$.\n$$ R(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 1 \\cdot (\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle V - \\langle V, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma}) $$\nSince $\\gamma$ is unit-speed, $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle = |\\dot{\\gamma}|^2 = 1$.\nThe inner product $\\langle V, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle = \\langle \\sin(\\pi t)E(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = \\sin(\\pi t)\\langle E(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle$.\nGiven $\\langle E(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$, we have $\\langle V(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$.\nSo, the curvature action simplifies to $R(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 1 \\cdot ((1)V - (0)\\dot{\\gamma}) = V$.\nThe curvature term in the integrand is:\n$$ \\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle = \\langle V, V \\rangle = |V(t)|^2 $$\n$|V(t)|^2 = |\\sin(\\pi t)E(t)|^2 = \\sin^2(\\pi t)|E(t)|^2 = \\sin^2(\\pi t)$, since $|E(t)|=1$.\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the integral for the index form:\n$$ I(V,V) = \\int_{0}^{1} (\\pi^2\\cos^2(\\pi t) - \\sin^2(\\pi t)) \\,dt $$\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the trigonometric identities $\\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$ and $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$ with $\\theta = \\pi t$.\n\\begin{align*}\nI(V,V) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( \\pi^2 \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\pi t)}{2} - \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\pi t)}{2} \\right) \\,dt \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} (\\pi^2 + \\pi^2\\cos(2\\pi t) - 1 + \\cos(2\\pi t)) \\,dt \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} ((\\pi^2 - 1) + (\\pi^2 + 1)\\cos(2\\pi t)) \\,dt \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\pi^2 - 1)t + (\\pi^2 + 1)\\frac{\\sin(2\\pi t)}{2\\pi} \\right]_{0}^{1} \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left( (\\pi^2 - 1)(1) + (\\pi^2 + 1)\\frac{\\sin(2\\pi)}{2\\pi} \\right) - \\left( (\\pi^2 - 1)(0) + (\\pi^2 + 1)\\frac{\\sin(0)}{2\\pi} \\right) \\right) \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2} ((\\pi^2 - 1) + 0 - 0 - 0) \\\\\n= \\frac{\\pi^2 - 1}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nThe value of the index form is $\\frac{\\pi^2-1}{2}$.\n\nFinally, we determine the sign of $I(V,V)$.

Consequently, the index form $I(V,V) = \\frac{\\pi^2-1}{2}$ is positive. The positive sign of the index form indicates that, for this particular variation, the energy of the geodesic $\\gamma$ is a local minimum.

Let us define a linear differential operator $L$ acting on functions $y$ satisfying the Dirichlet boundary conditions:\n$$\nLy = -y'' - \\kappa y = \\left(-\\frac{d^2}{dt^2} - \\kappa\\right)y.\n$$\nIn terms of this operator, the index form is simply the inner product of $y$ with $Ly$:\n$$\nI_{\\kappa}[y] = \\langle y, Ly \\rangle.\n$$\nThe Rayleigh quotient can now be expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{\\kappa}[y] = \\frac{\\langle y, Ly \\rangle}{\\langle y, y \\rangle}.\n$$\nAccording to the principles of spectral theory for self-adjoint operators (which $L$ is, on the specified domain), the minimum value of this Rayleigh quotient over all nonzero admissible functions is the smallest eigenvalue of the operator $L$. The minimizer $y(t)$ is the corresponding eigenfunction.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues of $L$, we must solve the eigenvalue equation $Ly = \\lambda y$ subject to the boundary conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y(1) = 0$.\n$$\n-y'' - \\kappa y = \\lambda y \\implies -y'' = (\\lambda + \\kappa)y.\n$$\nLet us define $\\mu = \\lambda + \\kappa$. The eigenvalue problem becomes the standard Sturm-Liouville problem for the operator $A = -\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}$ on $[0,1]$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions:\n$$\n-y'' = \\mu y, \\quad y(0) = 0, \\quad y(1) = 0.\n$$\nThe set of eigenvalues $\\{\\mu_n\\}$ of this operator is precisely the *Dirichlet spectrum* mentioned in the problem statement. We solve for these eigenvalues:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If $\\mu \\le 0$, the general solution to $y'' + \\mu y = 0$ does not allow for a nontrivial solution satisfying the boundary conditions. For $\\mu=0$, $y(t) = c_1 t + c_2$, and the boundary conditions force $c_1=c_2=0$. For $\\mu  0$, $y(t) = c_1 \\cosh(\\sqrt{-\\mu}t) + c_2 \\sinh(\\sqrt{-\\mu}t)$, which also forces $c_1=c_2=0$.\n    \\item If $\\mu  0$, the general solution is $y(t) = c_1 \\cos(\\sqrt{\\mu} t) + c_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\mu} t)$. The condition $y(0) = 0$ implies $c_1 = 0$. The solution is of the form $y(t) = c_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\mu} t)$. The condition $y(1) = 0$ requires $c_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\mu}) = 0$. For a nontrivial solution ($c_2 \\ne 0$), we must have $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\mu}) = 0$. This implies $\\sqrt{\\mu} = n\\pi$ for any positive integer $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThus, the eigenvalues of the operator $A = -\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}$ are $\\mu_n = (n\\pi)^2$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. The corresponding eigenfunctions are $y_n(t) = \\sin(n\\pi t)$.\n\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ of the original operator $L$ are related to $\\mu_n$ by $\\mu_n = \\lambda_n + \\kappa$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\lambda_n = \\mu_n - \\kappa = (n\\pi)^2 - \\kappa.\n$$\nThe spectrum of $L$ is $\\{\\pi^2 - \\kappa, (2\\pi)^2 - \\kappa, (3\\pi)^2 - \\kappa, \\dots\\}$.\nThe minimum of the Rayleigh quotient $\\mathcal{R}_{\\kappa}[y]$ is the smallest eigenvalue in this set, which corresponds to $n=1$:\n$$\n\\min_{y\\ne 0} \\mathcal{R}_{\\kappa}[y] = \\lambda_1 = \\pi^2 - \\kappa.\n$$\nThe minimizer is the eigenfunction $y_1(t) = \\sin(\\pi t)$, which confirms that the minimum is attained by an eigenfunction. This is a general principle: any admissible function $y$ can be expanded in the orthogonal basis of eigenfunctions $y_n(t)$, i.e., $y = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n y_n$. The Rayleigh quotient becomes $\\mathcal{R}_{\\kappa}[y] = (\\sum_n c_n^2 \\lambda_n \\|y_n\\|^2) / (\\sum_n c_n^2 \\|y_n\\|^2)$, which is a weighted average of the eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$. This average is clearly minimized when only the coefficient $c_1$ corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ is non-zero, i.e., when $y$ is the first eigenfunction.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to explain when the index form is positive for all nontrivial admissible $y$. The index form $I_{\\kappa}[y]$ is positive definite if and only if the Rayleigh quotient $\\mathcal{R}_{\\kappa}[y] = I_{\\kappa}[y] / \\int_0^1 y^2 dt$ is positive for all nonzero $y$. This is equivalent to requiring that the minimum value of the quotient be positive.\n$$\n\\min \\mathcal{R}_{\\kappa}[y]  0 \\implies \\pi^2 - \\kappa  0 \\implies \\kappa  \\pi^2.\n$$\nIn the context of Riemannian geometry, this condition means there are no points conjugate to $t=0$ along the geodesic in the interval $(0, 1]$. If $\\kappa = \\pi^2$, there is a conjugate point at $t=1$, and the index form is only positive semi-definite; its minimum is $0$.\n\nThe final answer required is the exact minimum of the Rayleigh quotient.\n$$\n\\text{min } \\mathcal{R}_{\\kappa}[y] = \\pi^2 - \\kappa.\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pi^2 - \\kappa}\n$$", "id": "3061414"}]}
