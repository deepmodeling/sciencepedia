Its tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = \\frac{dr}{ds}\\partial_r + \\frac{d\\theta}{ds}\\partial_\\theta = \\dot{r}(s)\\partial_r + \\dot{\\theta}(s)\\partial_\\theta$.\n\nThe given Riemannian metric is\n$$g \\;=\\; \\frac{4}{(1 - r^2)^2}\\,dr^2 + \\frac{4r^2}{(1 - r^2)^2}\\,d\\theta^2$$\nIn the coordinate basis $(\\partial_r, \\partial_\\theta)$, the components of the metric tensor are:\n$$g_{rr} = \\frac{4}{(1-r^2)^2}, \\quad g_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{4r^2}{(1-r^2)^2}, \\quad g_{r\\theta} = g_{\\theta r} = 0$$\n\nThe problem states that $\\partial_\\theta$ is a Killing field, and for a unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(s)$, the quantity $g(\\dot\\gamma, \\partial_\\theta)$ is conserved. Let's compute this quantity:\n$$g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\partial_\\theta) = g(\\dot{r}\\partial_r + \\dot{\\theta}\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_\\theta)$$\nUsing the bilinearity of the metric and the orthogonality of the coordinate basis vectors ($g_{r\\theta}=0$):\n$$g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\partial_\\theta) = \\dot{r}\\,g(\\partial_r, \\partial_\\theta) + \\dot{\\theta}\\,g(\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_\\theta) = \\dot{r}(0) + \\dot{\\theta}\\,g_{\\theta\\theta} = g_{\\theta\\theta}\\dot{\\theta}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $g_{\\theta\\theta}$:\n$$g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\partial_\\theta) = \\frac{4r(s)^2}{\\big(1 - r(s)^2\\big)^2}\\,\\dot{\\theta}(s)$$\nThis quantity is a constant along the geodesic. Let's call this constant $C$.\n$$C = \\frac{4r^2}{(1 - r^2)^2}\\,\\dot{\\theta}$$\nThis equation is the first integral of motion derived from the rotational symmetry. We can now analyze the nature of the geodesics by considering the possible values of $C$.\n\n**Case 1: $C=0$**\nIf the constant $C$ is zero, then we have:\n$$\\frac{4r(s)^2}{\\big(1 - r(s)^2\\big)^2}\\,\\dot{\\theta}(s) = 0$$\nFor a path not confined to the origin (where $r=0$), we must have $r(s) > 0$. Therefore, it must be that $\\dot{\\theta}(s) = 0$ for all $s$. This implies $\\theta(s) = \\theta_0$ for some constant angle $\\theta_0$. A curve of constant $\\theta$ is a radial line passing through the origin. In the context of the Poincaré disk, these are the diameters of the unit disk.\n\n**Case 2: $C \\neq 0$**\nIf the constant $C$ is non-zero, then $\\dot{\\theta}(s)$ is never zero. This means the geodesic is not a radial line and its angle $\\theta(s)$ is strictly monotonic.\n\nSince $\\gamma(s)$ is a unit-speed geodesic, we have $g(\\dot\\gamma, \\dot\\gamma) = 1$:\n$$1 = g_{rr}\\dot{r}^2 + g_{\\theta\\theta}\\dot{\\theta}^2 = \\frac{4}{(1-r^2)^2}\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{4r^2}{(1-r^2)^2}\\dot{\\theta}^2$$\nWe can substitute $\\dot{\\theta}$ from our conservation law, $\\dot{\\theta} = C \\frac{(1-r^2)^2}{4r^2}$:\n$$1 = \\frac{4}{(1-r^2)^2}\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{4r^2}{(1-r^2)^2} \\left[ C \\frac{(1-r^2)^2}{4r^2} \\right]^2$$\n$$1 = \\frac{4}{(1-r^2)^2}\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{C^2(1-r^2)^2}{4r^2}$$\nSolving for $\\dot{r}^2$:\n$$\\dot{r}^2 = \\frac{(1-r^2)^2}{4} \\left( 1 - \\frac{C^2(1-r^2)^2}{4r^2} \\right)$$\nFor $\\dot{r}$ to be a real number, the term in the parenthesis must be non-negative. This implies that the geodesic has a turning point in its radial coordinate, i.e., a point of closest approach to the origin, where $\\dot{r}=0$. This is inconsistent with the shape of a spiral but is consistent with a curve that approaches the origin from the boundary and then recedes back to the boundary.\n\nA full integration of this system of differential equations, or an analysis using other geometric methods (e.g., conformal mapping to the upper half-plane model), confirms that these trajectories are arcs of Euclidean circles. Furthermore, for these circular arcs to be geodesics in this metric, they must intersect the boundary of the Poincaré disk (the unit circle $\\{|z|=1\\}$) orthogonally.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The conserved quantity implied by rotational symmetry is $g(\\dot\\gamma,\\partial_\\theta) = r(s)\\,\\dot\\theta(s)$, hence it follows that $r(s)\\,\\dot\\theta(s)$ is constant and the image of any geodesic is a Euclidean circle tangent to the unit circle.**\nThe claim that the conserved quantity is $r(s)\\dot\\theta(s)$ is incorrect. This quantity relates to angular momentum in a flat Euclidean plane, not the hyperbolic plane with the given metric. As derived, the conserved quantity is $\\frac{4r^2}{(1-r^2)^2}\\dot\\theta$. The conclusion that geodesics are Euclidean circles *tangent* to the unit circle is also incorrect; such curves are horocycles, not geodesics (unless they are a straight line through the origin, which is a degenerate case).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. The conserved quantity implied by rotational symmetry is $g(\\dot\\gamma,\\partial_\\theta) = \\dfrac{4\\,r(s)^2}{\\big(1 - r(s)^2\\big)^2}\\,\\dot\\theta(s)$, which is constant along $\\gamma$. If this constant vanishes, $\\gamma$ is a Euclidean diameter (i.e., $\\theta(s)$ is constant); if it is nonzero, the image of $\\gamma$ in the disk is a Euclidean circle that intersects the unit circle $\\{|z|=1\\}$ orthogonally.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the conserved quantity, as derived above. It then correctly analyzes the two cases. If the constant is zero, $\\dot\\theta=0$, which corresponds to a radial line (a diameter). If the constant is non-zero, it correctly states the geometric result that the geodesics are Euclidean circles orthogonal to the boundary of the disk. This statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Because $\\partial_\\theta$ generates isometries, the only geodesics are curves of constant angle, $\\theta(s) \\equiv \\theta_0$, so every geodesic is a radial line.**\nThis statement makes a fallacious argument. The existence of a symmetry (generated by a Killing field) implies a conservation law, not that all motion must be along curves invariant under the symmetry group. While curves of constant angle (radial lines) are indeed geodesics, they are not the *only* ones. This reasoning is flawed and the conclusion is incomplete.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. For any unit-speed geodesic, the Euclidean curvature of its image in the disk vanishes, so the image is always a Euclidean straight line segment (possibly truncated by the unit circle).**\nThis statement is false. Geodesics are \"straight lines\" only with respect to the intrinsic metric of the manifold. In general, they are not straight lines in an embedding Euclidean space. For the Poincaré disk, only the geodesics that pass through the origin (diameters) are Euclidean straight line segments. All other geodesics are arcs of circles and thus have non-zero Euclidean curvature.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3069708"}]}
