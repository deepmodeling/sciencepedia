For $z=y^*=(y',-y_n)$:\n   $\\partial_{x_{n}}p(t,x,y^{*}) = p(t,x,y^{*})\\left(\\frac{-y_{n}-x_{n}}{2t}\\right) = -p(t,x,y^{*})\\left(\\frac{y_{n}+x_{n}}{2t}\\right)$\n\nSumming these gives the derivative of the Neumann kernel:\n$$\n\\partial_{x_{n}}K^{N}(t,x,y) = p(t,x,y)\\frac{y_{n}-x_{n}}{2t} - p(t,x,y^{*})\\frac{y_{n}+x_{n}}{2t}\n$$\nNow we take the limit as $x_n \\to 0^+$. Since all functions involved are continuous for $x_n \\ge 0$ (given $y_n0, t0$), this is equivalent to evaluating at $x_n=0$. Let $x_b = (x',0)$ be a point on the boundary.\nWe must evaluate the kernels $p(t,x,y)$ and $p(t,x,y^*)$ at $x_n=0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{x_n \\to 0^+} |x-y|^2 = |x'-y'|^2 + (0-y_n)^2 = |x'-y'|^2 + y_n^2\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{x_n \\to 0^+} |x-y^*|^2 = |x'-y'|^2 + (0-(-y_n))^2 = |x'-y'|^2 + y_n^2\n$$\nThe squared distances are equal on the boundary. Consequently, the values of the kernels are also equal on the boundary:\n$$\n\\lim_{x_n \\to 0^+} p(t,x,y) = \\lim_{x_n \\to 0^+} p(t,x,y^*) = (4\\pi t)^{-n/2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x'-y'|^2+y_n^2}{4t}\\right)\n$$\nLet this common value be $P_b$. Now we can evaluate the limit of the derivative:\n$$\n\\lim_{x_{n}\\to 0^{+}}\\partial_{x_{n}}K^{N}(t,x,y) = \\lim_{x_{n}\\to 0^{+}}\\left(p(t,x,y)\\frac{y_{n}-x_{n}}{2t} - p(t,x,y^{*})\\frac{y_{n}+x_{n}}{2t}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= P_b \\frac{y_n-0}{2t} - P_b \\frac{y_n+0}{2t} = P_b \\frac{y_n}{2t} - P_b \\frac{y_n}{2t} = 0\n$$\nThe boundary condition is satisfied. The boundary normal derivative is $0$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of this limit as the final answer. Based on the direct calculation above, the value is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3070120"}]}
