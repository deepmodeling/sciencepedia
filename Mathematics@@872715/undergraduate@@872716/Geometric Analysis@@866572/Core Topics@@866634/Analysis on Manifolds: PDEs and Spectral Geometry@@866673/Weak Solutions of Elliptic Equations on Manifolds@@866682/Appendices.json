All terms like $L^{p}$ spaces, Riemannian manifolds, volume growth, and the Bishop-Gromov theorem are well-established. The volume growth conditions are characteristic of manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. The problem is well-posed, as it asks for a specific value derived from a clear and formalizable definition of \"borderline convergence\" of an integral. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and does not suffer from any contradictions or missing information. The question is a fundamental calculation in the analysis of partial differential equations on manifolds, not trivial or pseudo-profound.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nA function $u$ belongs to the Lebesgue space $L^{p}(M)$ if its $L^{p}$-norm is finite. The $p$-th power of this norm is given by the integral:\n$$ \\|u\\|_{L^{p}(M)}^{p} = \\int_{M} |u(x)|^{p}\\, d\\mu_{g} $$\nThe function $u$ is given to be radial, i.e., $u(x) = \\varphi(r)$ where $r = d(o,x)$. We can express the integral in geodesic polar coordinates around the point $o$. Using the coarea formula, the volume measure $d\\mu_{g}$ can be written as $d\\mu_{g} = A(r) \\, dr$, where $A(r)$ is the $(n-1)$-dimensional volume of the geodesic sphere $\\partial B(o,r)$ of radius $r$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\|u\\|_{L^{p}(M)}^{p} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\varphi(r)|^{p} A(r) \\, dr $$\nThe problem states that the volume growth conditions are compatible with a radial density that \"behaves like $r^{n-1}$\". This is a key simplification, which is exact in the model case of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In this case, $A(r) = C_{n}r^{n-1}$, where $C_{n}$ is the surface area of the $(n-1)$-dimensional unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Therefore, the convergence of the integral is determined by the behavior of:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\varphi(r)|^{p} r^{n-1} \\, dr $$\nWe are given that the function has an asymptotic power-type decay, $\\varphi(r) \\approx r^{-\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha  0$, for small and large $r$. Substituting this into the integral, we analyze the convergence of:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |r^{-\\alpha}|^{p} r^{n-1} \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (r^{-\\alpha})^{p} r^{n-1} \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{-p\\alpha} r^{n-1} \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{n-1-p\\alpha} \\, dr $$\nTo determine the convergence of this improper integral, we must analyze its behavior at both limits of integration, $r \\to 0$ and $r \\to \\infty$. We split the integral at an arbitrary point, for instance $r=1$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{n-1-p\\alpha} \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{1} r^{n-1-p\\alpha} \\, dr + \\int_{1}^{\\infty} r^{n-1-p\\alpha} \\, dr $$\nThis is an integral of the form $\\int r^{k} \\, dr$ with $k = n-1-p\\alpha$.\nFor the integral to converge near $r=0$, the exponent must be greater than $-1$:\n$$ n - 1 - p\\alpha > -1 \\implies n - p\\alpha > 0 \\implies n > p\\alpha \\implies \\alpha  \\frac{n}{p} $$\nFor the integral to converge near $r=\\infty$, the exponent must be less than $-1$:\n$$ n - 1 - p\\alpha  -1 \\implies n - p\\alpha  0 \\implies n  p\\alpha \\implies \\alpha > \\frac{n}{p} $$\nThese two conditions, $\\alpha  \\frac{n}{p}$ and $\\alpha > \\frac{n}{p}$, are mutually exclusive. This means that a function with the exact form $u(x) = |x|^{-\\alpha}$ can never be in $L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$, as the integral for its norm will always diverge at either the origin or at infinity.\n\nThe problem, however, asks for the critical exponent $\\alpha_{c}$, which is defined as the value of $\\alpha$ for which the \"radial $p$-energy density\" $r^{n-1}|r^{-\\alpha}|^{p}$ has \"borderline convergence\" at both $r \\to 0$ and $r \\to \\infty$. The radial $p$-energy density is the integrand $r^{n-1-p\\alpha}$. The borderline case for convergence of the integral $\\int r^{k} \\, dr$ at both $r=0$ and $r=\\infty$ occurs precisely when the exponent $k$ is equal to $-1$. In this case, the primitive function is $\\ln(r)$, which diverges at both $r \\to 0$ and $r \\to \\infty$. This is the mathematical formalization of \"borderline convergence\" at both ends.\n\nThus, we must set the exponent of $r$ in the integrand to $-1$:\n$$ n - 1 - p\\alpha_{c} = -1 $$\nSolving for the critical exponent $\\alpha_{c}$:\n$$ n - p\\alpha_{c} = 0 $$\n$$ p\\alpha_{c} = n $$\n$$ \\alpha_{c} = \\frac{n}{p} $$\nThis value $\\alpha_{c} = \\frac{n}{p}$ represents the critical decay exponent. For a function to be in $L^p$, it generally needs to be less singular than $r^{-n/p}$ at the origin and decay faster than $r^{-n/p}$ at infinity.
