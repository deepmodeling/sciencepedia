## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the principles and mechanisms of the Sunada construction, a profound group-theoretic method for generating [isospectral manifolds](@entry_id:190488). We have seen that this construction provides a definitive negative answer to the question "Can one [hear the shape of a drum](@entry_id:187233)?", demonstrating that the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator does not uniquely determine the geometry of a manifold up to [isometry](@entry_id:150881). This chapter moves beyond the core theorem to explore its broader implications and applications. We will examine how the abstract algebraic framework is realized in concrete geometric contexts, how the method is extended to more general settings, and what its consequences are for the [inverse spectral problem](@entry_id:634757). This exploration will reveal the Sunada construction not as an isolated curiosity, but as a versatile tool that forges deep connections between [spectral geometry](@entry_id:186460), representation theory, number theory, and topology.

### Canonical Examples and Constructions

The power of Sunada's method lies in its ability to translate a problem in [spectral geometry](@entry_id:186460) into a question in [finite group theory](@entry_id:146601)—namely, finding a "Sunada triple" $(G, H_1, H_2)$ where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are almost conjugate but not [conjugate subgroups](@entry_id:140560) of a [finite group](@entry_id:151756) $G$. The existence of such triples is a purely algebraic fact. The geometric part of the construction then requires realizing this algebraic data, which typically involves finding a suitable manifold $\tilde{M}$ on which $G$ acts freely and isometrically. The following examples illustrate how this is achieved in diverse and important geometric settings. [@problem_id:3064293]

#### Arithmetic Surfaces and Number Theory

A particularly rich source of Sunada triples and their geometric realizations is found at the interface of hyperbolic geometry and number theory. Arithmetic surfaces, which are quotients of the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}$ by [congruence subgroups](@entry_id:195720) of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, provide a fertile ground for the construction. The key insight is that the arithmetic nature of these groups provides a natural way to generate the necessary finite [group actions](@entry_id:268812). Specifically, for a [congruence](@entry_id:194418) subgroup $\Gamma \subset \mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, the process of reducing matrix entries modulo an integer $N$ gives rise to group homomorphisms $\rho_N: \Gamma \to \mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$. For many choices of $N$ (e.g., prime numbers), the Strong Approximation Theorem guarantees that these maps are surjective, or at least have a large image $G$. This provides the [finite group](@entry_id:151756) $G$ and the requisite homomorphism from the fundamental group of a base surface. The remaining task is to find almost conjugate, non-[conjugate subgroups](@entry_id:140560) within finite groups like $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Such pairs are known to exist, for instance, within certain $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ groups, providing an abundant supply of the ingredients for Sunada's construction. This connection highlights a deep interplay, where number theory provides the algebraic tools to construct geometric objects with specific spectral properties.

#### Flat Manifolds and Crystallographic Groups

While hyperbolic geometry offers a rich landscape, the Sunada construction can also be implemented in the geometrically simpler context of flat manifolds. A prime example involves constructing isospectral flat tori. Consider the $6$-dimensional torus $\widetilde{M} = \mathbb{T}^6 = \mathbb{R}^6/\mathbb{Z}^6$. By the Bieberbach theorems, it is possible to construct a free, isometric action of the [symmetric group](@entry_id:142255) $G = S_6$ on $\mathbb{T}^6$ via affine transformations. The group theory of $S_6$ provides a classic example of a non-conjugate, almost conjugate pair of subgroups. The symmetric group $S_4$ can be embedded into $S_6$ in two standard ways that are not conjugate: one as the stabilizer of two points (e.g., [permutations](@entry_id:147130) of $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$), and another arising from the action of $S_4$ (the [isometry group](@entry_id:161661) of a tetrahedron) on the six edges of the tetrahedron. These two subgroups, both isomorphic to $S_4$, are a well-known Gassmann equivalent pair. Applying Sunada's theorem to this setup, with $\widetilde{M} = \mathbb{T}^6$ and these two subgroups of $S_6$, yields a pair of isospectral, non-isometric 6-dimensional flat manifolds. This example demonstrates that the intricate geometry of [constant negative curvature](@entry_id:269792) is not essential for the construction; the purely algebraic conditions can be realized in the context of [nilmanifolds](@entry_id:147370), of which flat tori are the simplest case. [@problem_id:3064317]

#### The "Sound of a Drum" and Boundary Transplantation

Perhaps the most famous application related to Sunada's ideas is the construction of isospectral planar domains by Gordon, Webb, and Wolpert, which provided a definitive "no" to Mark Kac's question. While their method, known as boundary transplantation, is not a direct application of the quotient construction, it is animated by the same core principle: isospectrality arising from an [intertwining operator](@entry_id:139675) that swaps underlying symmetries. The construction involves dissecting two different planar domains into a set of congruent tiles (e.g., triangles) and then showing that the gluing maps that define the domains are related by an intertwining matrix. This matrix allows one to "transplant" an eigenfunction of the Laplacian on one domain to an eigenfunction with the same eigenvalue on the other. The group-theoretic backbone of their original example is, in fact, the same as the most famous Sunada triple: the group $G = \mathrm{PSL}(3,2) \cong \mathrm{PSL}(2,7)$ of order $168$, and its two non-conjugate, almost [conjugate subgroups](@entry_id:140560) $H_p$ and $H_l$, which are the stabilizers of a point and a line, respectively, in the Fano plane. This connection illustrates that the fundamental concept of representation-theoretic equivalence underlying Sunada's theorem can manifest in various geometric forms, including the combinatorial gluing of domains.

### Extensions of the Core Method

The principles underpinning the Sunada construction are robust and can be extended beyond the archetypal setting of the Laplacian on closed manifolds. These generalizations further underscore the method's power and versatility.

#### Isospectrality on Differential Forms

The representation-theoretic argument for isospectrality is not specific to functions (0-forms). It can be extended to the Hodge Laplacian $\Delta_p = dd^*+d^*d$ acting on the space of differential $p$-forms. The key requirement is that the group action commutes with the operator. Since the group $G$ acts by isometries, the [pullback](@entry_id:160816) action $g^*$ commutes with the exterior derivative $d$. For it to commute with the Hodge star operator $*$, and therefore with the [codifferential](@entry_id:197182) $d^*$ and the full Hodge Laplacian $\Delta_p$, the isometries must be orientation-preserving. When a finite group $G$ acts freely by [orientation-preserving isometries](@entry_id:266073) on a manifold $\tilde{M}$, the [eigenspaces](@entry_id:147356) of $\Delta_p$ on $\tilde{M}$ are all $G$-modules. The same representation-theoretic argument then applies, proving that if $H_1$ and $H_2$ are almost [conjugate subgroups](@entry_id:140560), the [quotient manifolds](@entry_id:190622) $M_1 = \tilde{M}/H_1$ and $M_2 = \tilde{M}/H_2$ are isospectral on $p$-forms for all $p = 0, 1, \dots, n$. This powerful generalization shows that Sunada pairs are not just isospectral on functions, but their full vibrational signatures across all form degrees are identical. [@problem_id:3064320]

#### Manifolds with Boundary and Orbifolds

The construction can also be adapted to non-closed manifolds. For a [compact manifold](@entry_id:158804) $M$ with a smooth boundary $\partial M$, one can consider the spectrum of the Laplacian with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. To apply Sunada's method, the group action must respect the boundary conditions. Two primary strategies achieve this. The most direct approach is to require that the group $G$ acts by isometries that preserve the boundary $\partial M$ setwise. Under this condition, the domain of the Laplacian with either Dirichlet or Neumann conditions is a $G$-invariant subspace of functions, and the standard argument applies directly. A second, more elegant method is to use the "manifold double" construction. One glues two copies of $M$ along their common boundary to form a closed manifold $D(M)$ equipped with a natural reflection isometry. If the $G$-action on $M$ extends to $D(M)$ in a way that commutes with this reflection, one can apply the standard Sunada theorem to the closed manifold $D(M)$. The isospectrality of the doubles then descends to prove the separate isospectrality of the quotients $M/H_i$ for both the Dirichlet and Neumann problems. [@problem_id:3064295]

Furthermore, the requirement of a free group action can be relaxed. If the action of $G$ on $\tilde{M}$ has fixed points, the quotients $\tilde{M}/H_i$ are no longer smooth manifolds but become orbifolds, which possess singularities. Nonetheless, the [heat trace](@entry_id:200414) formalism of Sunada's proof remains valid. The [heat trace](@entry_id:200414) of the Laplacian on the quotient [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) can still be expressed as an average of traces of twisted heat operators over the [covering space](@entry_id:139261). The almost conjugacy condition ensures these averages are identical, proving that the resulting orbifolds are isospectral. This demonstrates the robustness of the method, extending its reach from the category of smooth manifolds to the broader category of orbifolds. [@problem_id:3064299]

### Implications for the Inverse Spectral Problem

The existence of isospectral, non-isometric manifolds, as guaranteed by Sunada's construction, has profound consequences for the [inverse spectral problem](@entry_id:634757). It forces a distinction between geometric properties that are "audible" (determined by the spectrum) and those that are not.

#### Spectral Invariants

Any geometric or topological quantity that is uniquely determined by the Laplacian spectrum is known as a spectral invariant. Since Sunada pairs are isospectral, they must share all [spectral invariants](@entry_id:200177). The primary tool for identifying such invariants is the small-time [asymptotic expansion](@entry_id:149302) of the [heat trace](@entry_id:200414), $H_M(t) = \sum_k e^{-t\lambda_k}$. As $t \to 0^+$, this function has an expansion of the form $H_M(t) \sim (4\pi t)^{-n/2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k t^k$. Since [isospectral manifolds](@entry_id:190488) have identical heat traces for all $t > 0$, their entire sequence of heat invariants $\{a_k\}$ must be identical. The first few coefficients are integrals of fundamental geometric quantities: $a_0 = \mathrm{Vol}(M)$ and $a_1 \propto \int_M R \,d\mathrm{vol}$, where $R$ is the [scalar curvature](@entry_id:157547). Consequently, any two [isospectral manifolds](@entry_id:190488)—including any Sunada pair—must have the same dimension, same volume, and same total scalar curvature. The same holds for all higher heat invariants, which are integrals of more complex curvature polynomials. [@problem_id:3064316] [@problem_id:3064351]

#### Distinguishing Isospectral Pairs

The existence of isospectral, non-isometric manifolds proves that the Laplacian spectrum is an incomplete geometric invariant. This naturally leads to the question: what finer invariants can distinguish between them? For the important case of [hyperbolic surfaces](@entry_id:185960), the Selberg trace formula establishes that isospectrality implies that the surfaces are also *iso-length-spectral*, meaning they have the same multiset of lengths of [closed geodesics](@entry_id:190155). However, this is still not enough to guarantee isometry. One can define a finer invariant, the *marked [length spectrum](@entry_id:637087)*, which is the function that assigns to each conjugacy class in the fundamental group the length of the corresponding [closed geodesic](@entry_id:186985). There exist Sunada pairs of [hyperbolic surfaces](@entry_id:185960) that are isospectral (and thus iso-length-spectral) but do not have the same marked [length spectrum](@entry_id:637087), for instance because their fundamental groups are not isomorphic. Another distinguishing feature can be the count of *simple* (non-self-intersecting) [closed geodesics](@entry_id:190155). This count is not a spectral invariant, and examples of isospectral Sunada pairs are known to exist that possess different numbers of simple [closed geodesics](@entry_id:190155) of a given length. These examples underscore that while the spectrum encodes a remarkable amount of geometric information, it does not capture the full topological and metric structure of a manifold. [@problem_id:3064343] [@problem_id:3064300]

#### Spectral Data and Topology

The connection between spectral data and geometry deepens when we consider the spectra of the Hodge Laplacians on all $p$-forms. A celebrated result known as the McKean-Singer formula states that for a closed, oriented Riemannian manifold, the Euler characteristic $\chi(M)$ can be expressed as the alternating sum of the heat traces for the $p$-form Laplacians, an expression which is remarkably independent of time $t$:
$$ \chi(M) = \sum_{p=0}^n (-1)^p \mathrm{Tr}(e^{-t\Delta_p}) $$
Now, suppose we have a Sunada pair $(M, N)$ of even dimension $n$ that is isospectral on *all* $p$-forms, a property guaranteed by the general version of Sunada's theorem. This means $\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-t\Delta_p^M}) = \mathrm{Tr}(e^{-t\Delta_p^N})$ for every $p$. It immediately follows from the McKean-Singer formula that their Euler characteristics must also be equal: $\chi(M) = \chi(N)$. This provides a beautiful example of how the complete spectral data of a manifold can determine one of its most fundamental [topological invariants](@entry_id:138526). Even though the manifolds may differ geometrically, their full spectra are constrained in a way that preserves their overall [topological complexity](@entry_id:261170) as measured by $\chi(M)$. [@problem_id:3064336]

In conclusion, the Sunada construction and its subsequent developments have fundamentally reshaped our understanding of the relationship between the spectrum and geometry of a manifold. Far from being a mere counterexample, it serves as a unifying principle that reveals deep and often surprising connections across different branches of mathematics and provides a powerful framework for exploring the subtle question of what it means to "hear the shape" of a space.
