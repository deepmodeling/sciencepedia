First, we determine the spectrum of the negative Laplace-Beltrami operator on the two-dimensional flat torus $T^2$. Second, we compute the multiplicity of a specific eigenvalue using number theory.\n\nPart 1: Eigenfunctions and Eigenvalues of $-\\Delta$ on $T^2$\n\nThe two-dimensional torus $T^{2}$ is defined as the quotient space $T^{2} = \\mathbb{R}^{2} / (2\\pi \\mathbb{Z})^{2}$. A smooth complex-valued function $u$ on $T^{2}$ can be identified with a smooth function on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that is periodic with period $2\\pi$ in each coordinate variable, $x$ and $y$. That is, for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$:\n$$u(x+2\\pi, y) = u(x, y) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u(x, y+2\\pi) = u(x, y)$$\nThe flat metric on $T^2$ is induced from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. In the local coordinates $(x,y)$, the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ is the standard Euclidean Laplacian, $\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$. We are tasked with solving the eigenvalue problem for the operator $-\\Delta$:\n$$-\\Delta u(x, y) = \\lambda u(x, y)$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the eigenvalue and $u$ is the corresponding eigenfunction. The equation in coordinates is:\n$$-\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\right) = \\lambda u$$\nWe use the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the partial differential equation yields:\n$$-\\left( \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}Y(y) + X(x)\\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2} \\right) = \\lambda X(x)Y(y)$$\nDividing by $X(x)Y(y)$ (for non-trivial solutions), we separate the variables:\n$$-\\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2} = \\lambda$$\nThe first term depends only on $x$ and the second only on $y$. For their sum to be a constant $\\lambda$ for all $(x, y)$, each term must be a constant. Let these constants be $\\lambda_x$ and $\\lambda_y$:\n$$-\\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = \\lambda_x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -\\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2} = \\lambda_y$$\nsuch that $\\lambda = \\lambda_x + \\lambda_y$. This gives two independent ordinary differential equations with periodic boundary conditions:\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda_x X(x) = 0, \\quad X(x+2\\pi) = X(x)$$\n$$Y''(y) + \\lambda_y Y(y) = 0, \\quad Y(y+2\\pi) = Y(y)$$\nLet's solve the equation for $X(x)$. We seek complex-valued solutions of the form $X(x) = C\\exp(ikx)$. Substituting into the ODE gives $(-k^2 + \\lambda_x)C\\exp(ikx) = 0$, so $\\lambda_x = k^2$. The periodicity condition $X(x+2\\pi) = X(x)$ becomes $C\\exp(ik(x+2\\pi)) = C\\exp(ikx)$, which simplifies to $\\exp(ik2\\pi) = 1$. This is satisfied if and only if $k$ is an integer. Let $k=m$, where $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, for each integer $m$, we have an eigenfunction $X_m(x) = \\exp(imx)$ with a corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda_x = m^2$.\nThe same argument applies to the equation for $Y(y)$. The solutions are $Y_n(y) = \\exp(iny)$ with eigenvalues $\\lambda_y = n^2$ for any integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe eigenfunctions of $-\\Delta$ on $T^2$ are the products $u_{m,n}(x,y) = X_m(x)Y_n(y)$:\n$$u_{m,n}(x,y) = \\exp(imx)\\exp(iny) = \\exp(i(mx+ny))$$\nwhere $(m,n)$ is any pair of integers in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. The corresponding eigenvalues $\\lambda_{m,n}$ are the sums of the individual eigenvalues:\n$$\\lambda_{m,n} = \\lambda_x + \\lambda_y = m^2 + n^2$$\nThe set of all eigenvalues, known as the spectrum of $-\\Delta$, is $\\text{spec}(-\\Delta) = \\{m^2 + n^2 \\mid m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\nThe spectrum is discrete because the eigenvalues are non-negative integers. For any value $K \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the number of eigenvalues $\\lambda_{m,n} \\leq K$ is finite. This is because the condition $m^2 + n^2 \\leq K$ implies that the integer lattice points $(m,n)$ must lie within a closed disk of radius $\\sqrt{K}$ centered at the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and any finite region of the plane contains only a finite number of lattice points. Therefore, the eigenvalues form a discrete sequence tending to infinity.\n\nAn eigenvalue $\\lambda=N$ arises whenever $N$ can be expressed as a sum of two integer squares. The multiplicity of the eigenvalue $N$ is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to it. The eigenfunctions $\\{ u_{m,n} \\mid m^2+n^2=N \\}$ are linearly independent. Therefore, the multiplicity of $N$ is equal to the number of distinct integer pairs $(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ such that $m^2+n^2=N$. Geometrically, this is the number of integer lattice points on the circle of radius $\\sqrt{N}$ in the Cartesian plane.\n\nPart 2: Multiplicity of $\\lambda = N = 5^4 \\cdot 13^2 \\cdot 17$\n\nThe multiplicity of the eigenvalue $N$ is the number of ways to write $N$ as a sum of two squares of integers, $m^2+n^2=N$, where $m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This quantity is given by the number-theoretic function $r_2(N)$. The value of $r_2(N)$ can be determined from the prime factorization of $N$ using a result known as Jacobi's two-square theorem.\n\nLet the prime factorization of $N$ be given by $N = 2^k \\prod_{i} p_i^{a_i} \\prod_{j} q_j^{b_j}$, where each $p_i$ is a distinct prime of the form $4\\ell+1$ and each $q_j$ is a distinct prime of the form $4\\ell+3$.\nThe number of representations of $N$ as a sum of two squares, $r_2(N)$, is zero if any exponent $b_j$ (of a prime congruent to $3$ modulo $4$) is odd. If all exponents $b_j$ are even, then the number of representations is given by the formula:\n$$r_2(N) = 4 \\prod_{i} (a_i+1)$$\nWe are given the eigenvalue $N = 5^{4} \\cdot 13^{2} \\cdot 17$. We can write this as $N = 5^{4} \\cdot 13^{2} \\cdot 17^{1}$. We now analyze the prime factors:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The prime $5$ has the form $4\\ell+1$ (with $\\ell=1$). Its exponent is $a_1 = 4$.\n    \\item The prime $13$ has the form $4\\ell+1$ (with $\\ell=3$). Its exponent is $a_2 = 2$.\n    \\item The prime $17$ has the form $4\\ell+1$ (with $\\ell=4$). Its exponent is $a_3 = 1$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe factorization of $N$ contains no prime factors of the form $4\\ell+3$. This means the condition for a non-zero number of solutions is satisfied (vacuously, as all exponents $b_j$ can be considered to be $0$, which is even). The factor $2^k$ is also not present, so $k=0$.\n\nWe can now apply the formula for $r_2(N)$ with the exponents $a_1=4$, $a_2=2$, and $a_3=1$:\n$$r_2(N) = 4 (a_1+1)(a_2+1)(a_3+1)$$\nSubstituting the values of the exponents:\n$$r_2(N) = 4 (4+1)(2+1)(1+1)$$\n$$r_2(N) = 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$r_2(N) = 20 \\cdot 6 = 120$$\nTherefore, the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\\lambda = N = 5^{4} \\cdot 13^{2} \\cdot 17$ is $120$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{120}$$", "id": "3045903"}, {"introduction": "For most manifolds, especially those with curvature like the sphere, explicitly computing eigenvalues is impossible.

The diameter of a Riemannian manifold is the supremum of the geodesic distance between any two of its points. For a sphere of radius $R$, the maximum distance is between antipodal points, and this distance is measured along a great circle.

Consequently, we can express the radius as $R = \\frac{D}{\\pi}$.\n\nNext, we must construct a smooth test function $f: S^{2}_{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with zero mean.

Let $S^{2}_{R}$ be centered at the origin, defined by the equation $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = R^{2}$. We choose the test function to be the restriction of the coordinate function $z$:\n$$\nf(x, y, z) = z\n$$\nThis function is smooth on $S^{2}_{R}$ as it is the restriction of a smooth function on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. It is not identically zero. To verify the zero-mean condition, $\\int_{S^{2}_{R}} f \\, d\\mu = 0$, we observe that the function $f(x,y,z)=z$ is odd with respect to reflection across the $xy$-plane ($z \\mapsto -z$), while the surface element $d\\mu$ is symmetric. The integral over the upper hemisphere ($z  0$) cancels precisely with the integral over the lower hemisphere ($z  0$), yielding a total integral of zero.
