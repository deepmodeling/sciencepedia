The characteristic equation for this ODE is $r^{2} + \\lambda = 0$, which yields $r = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\lambda}$. We analyze the nature of the solutions based on the sign of $\\lambda$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\lambda < 0$**\nLet $\\lambda = -\\mu^{2}$ for some real $\\mu > 0$. The ODE becomes $u''(x) - \\mu^{2} u(x) = 0$. The general solution can be written as $u(x) = A\\cosh(\\mu x) + B\\sinh(\\mu x)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $u(0)=0$:\n$u(0) = A\\cosh(0) + B\\sinh(0) = A(1) + B(0) = A = 0$.\nThe solution reduces to $u(x) = B\\sinh(\\mu x)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $u(L)=0$:\n$u(L) = B\\sinh(\\mu L) = 0$.\nSince $L > 0$ and $\\mu > 0$, we have $\\sinh(\\mu L) \\neq 0$. Therefore, we must have $B=0$.\nThis leads to the trivial solution $u(x) = 0$. Since eigenfunctions must be nontrivial, there are no negative eigenvalues.\n\n**Case 2: $\\lambda = 0$**\nThe ODE becomes $u''(x) = 0$. The general solution is $u(x) = Ax + B$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $u(0)=0$:\n$u(0) = A(0) + B = B = 0$.\nThe solution reduces to $u(x) = Ax$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $u(L)=0$:\n$u(L) = AL = 0$.\nSince $L > 0$, we must have $A=0$.\nThis also leads to the trivial solution $u(x) = 0$. Thus, $\\lambda=0$ is not an eigenvalue.\n\n**Case 3: $\\lambda > 0$**\nLet $\\lambda = k^{2}$ for some real $k > 0$. The ODE becomes $u''(x) + k^{2} u(x) = 0$. The general solution is $u(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $u(0)=0$:\n$u(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A(1) + B(0) = A = 0$.\nThe solution reduces to $u(x) = B\\sin(kx)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $u(L)=0$:\n$u(L) = B\\sin(kL) = 0$.\nFor a nontrivial solution, we require $B \\neq 0$. This implies that $\\sin(kL) = 0$.\nThe sine function is zero at integer multiples of $\\pi$. Thus, $kL = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nSince we defined $k > 0$ and $L > 0$, $n$ must be a positive integer, i.e., $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\nThis quantizes the possible values of $k$:\n$k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe corresponding eigenvalues are:\n$\\lambda_n = k_n^{2} = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2}$.\nThe unnormalized eigenfunctions associated with each eigenvalue $\\lambda_n$ are of the form $u_n(x) = B_n \\sin(k_n x) = B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$, where $B_n$ is an arbitrary non-zero constant.\n\n### Normalization of Eigenfunctions\n\nWe need to find the normalization constant $C_n$ such that the function $\\phi_n(x) = C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ has a norm of $1$ in $L^{2}(0,L)$. The condition is $\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_n \\rangle = 1$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\left(C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right)^{2} dx = 1\n$$\n$$\nC_n^{2} \\int_{0}^{L} \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx = 1\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the trigonometric identity $\\sin^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) dx\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ x - \\frac{L}{2n\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left(L - \\frac{L}{2n\\pi} \\sin(2n\\pi)\\right) - \\left(0 - \\frac{L}{2n\\pi} \\sin(0)\\right) \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\sin(2n\\pi) = 0$ for any integer $n$, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{1}{2}(L - 0) = \\frac{L}{2}$.\nSubstituting this back into the normalization condition:\n$C_n^{2} \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = 1 \\implies C_n^{2} = \\frac{2}{L}$.\nBy convention, we choose the positive root for the normalization constant, so $C_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}$.\nThe normalized eigenfunctions are:\n$\\phi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n### Verification of Orthonormality\n\nWe must verify that $\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_m \\rangle = \\delta_{nm}$, where $\\delta_{nm}$ is the Kronecker delta.\nThe case $n=m$ has already been established during normalization, as $\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_n \\rangle = 1$.\nNow we consider the case $n \\neq m$, where $n$ and $m$ are distinct positive integers.\n$$\n\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_m \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) dx\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx\n$$\nWe use the product-to-sum identity $\\sin(A)\\sin(B) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(A-B) - \\cos(A+B)]$.\n$$\n\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_m \\rangle = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2} \\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{(n-m)\\pi x}{L}\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{(n+m)\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right] dx\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{L} \\left[ \\frac{L}{(n-m)\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{(n-m)\\pi x}{L}\\right) - \\frac{L}{(n+m)\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{(n+m)\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L}\n$$\nSince $n \\neq m$, the denominators $n-m$ and $n+m$ are non-zero.\nEvaluating at the limits:\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{n-m} \\sin((n-m)\\pi) - \\frac{1}{n+m} \\sin((n+m)\\pi) \\right] - \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{n-m} \\sin(0) - \\frac{1}{n+m} \\sin(0) \\right]\n$$\nSince $n$ and $m$ are integers, $n-m$ and $n+m$ are also integers. The sine of any integer multiple of $\\pi$ is $0$.\nTherefore, $\\sin((n-m)\\pi)=0$ and $\\sin((n+m)\\pi)=0$.

Here $\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$ is the Laplace operator.\n\nWe use the method of separation of variables. We assume a non-trivial solution of the form $u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the PDE, we get\n$$\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) + \\lambda X(x)Y(y) = 0\n$$\nwhere $X''(x) = \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}$ and $Y''(y) = \\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2}$.

Since $m_1, m_2, n_1, n_2$ are integers, the right-hand side is a rational number. An irrational number can equal a rational number only if both are zero. This implies $m_2^2 - m_1^2 = 0$ and $n_1^2 - n_2^2 = 0$. Since $m,n$ are positive, this means $m_1=m_2$ and $n_1=n_2$. Therefore, if $\\rho^2$ is irrational, every eigenvalue is simple (has multiplicity $1$).\n\nMultiplicities greater than $1$ can occur if $\\rho^2$ is rational. This is a number theoretic condition. The most prominent special case is the square, where $a=b$. In this case, $\\rho=1$ and $\\rho^2=1$. The condition for repeated eigenvalues becomes $m_1^2 + n_1^2 = m_2^2 + n_2^2$.\nFor any pair of distinct positive integers $(m,n)$, the pairs $(m,n)$ and $(n,m)$ are distinct. However, they give the same sum $m^2+n^2=n^2+m^2$. For instance, $\\lambda_{m,n} = \\lambda_{n,m}$. This implies that for a square domain, any eigenvalue $\\lambda_{m,n}$ with $m \\neq n$ has a multiplicity of at least $2$. The eigenfunctions $u_{m,n}$ and $u_{n,m}$ are linearly independent.\n\nFinally, we specialize to the square case $a=b=L$ with $L>0$ and find the smallest eigenvalue with multiplicity strictly greater than $1$. The eigenvalues are given by:\n$$\n\\lambda_{m,n} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}(m^2+n^2), \\quad m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\n$$\nWe need to find the smallest integer value of $k = m^2+n^2$ that can be represented as a sum of two squares of positive integers in more than one way. Let's list the values of $k$ for small $m,n$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $m=1, n=1$: $k = 1^2+1^2 = 2$. The only pair of positive integers is $(1,1)$.

Therefore, each eigenvalue $\\lambda_n=n^2$ for $n \\ge 1$ has a multiplicity of $2$.\n\nCase 2: $\\lambda = 0$.\nThe equation becomes $\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = 0$. The general solution is $f(x) = Ax + B$.\nApplying the boundary condition $f(x+2\\pi) = f(x)$:\n$A(x+2\\pi) + B = Ax + B$.\nThis simplifies to $Ax + 2\\pi A + B = Ax + B$, which implies $2\\pi A = 0$, so $A = 0$.\nThe solution is $f(x) = B$, a constant function. For a non-trivial eigenfunction, we require $B \\neq 0$. Thus, $\\lambda_0 = 0$ is an eigenvalue. The corresponding eigenspace is the space of constant functions, which is one-dimensional (spanned by the function $f(x)=1$). The multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\\lambda_0=0$ is $1$.\n\nCase 3: $\\lambda < 0$.\nLet $\\lambda = -k^2$ for some real number $k > 0$. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - k^2 = 0$, with roots $r=\\pm k$. The general solution is\n$$\nf(x) = A e^{kx} + B e^{-kx}.\n$$\nApplying the boundary condition $f(x+2\\pi) = f(x)$:\n$A e^{k(x+2\\pi)} + B e^{-k(x+2\\pi)} = A e^{kx} + B e^{-kx}$.\n$A e^{kx}e^{2\\pi k} + B e^{-kx}e^{-2\\pi k} = A e^{kx} + B e^{-kx}$.\nSince $e^{kx}$ and $e^{-kx}$ are linearly independent functions, we can equate their coefficients:\n$A e^{2\\pi k} = A \\implies A(e^{2\\pi k} - 1) = 0$.\n$B e^{-2\\pi k} = B \\implies B(e^{-2\\pi k} - 1) = 0$.\nSince $k > 0$, $e^{2\\pi k} \\neq 1$ and $e^{-2\\pi k} \\neq 1$. Thus, we must have $A = 0$ and $B = 0$. This leads to the trivial solution $f(x) \\equiv 0$, which is not an eigenfunction. Therefore, there are no negative eigenvalues.\n\nSummary of Eigenvalues, Eigenfunctions, and Multiplicities:\nThe spectrum of $\\Delta$ on $S^1$ is $\\sigma(\\Delta) = \\{n^2 \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}\\}$.\n- The eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = 0^2 = 0$ has multiplicity $1$. The corresponding eigenfunction is any non-zero constant function.\n- The eigenvalues $\\lambda_n = n^2$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ each have multiplicity $2$. The eigenspace for $\\lambda_n$ is spanned by the functions $\\{\\cos(nx), \\sin(nx)\\}$.\n\nOrthonormal Basis in $L^2(S^1)$:\nThe inner product on $L^2(S^1)$ is given by $\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\int_0^{2\\pi} f(x)g(x) dx$. We normalize the basis functions.\n- For $\\lambda_0 = 0$, the eigenfunction is $f_0(x)=c$. The norm squared is $\\|c\\|^2 = \\int_0^{2\\pi} c^2 dx = 2\\pi c^2$. For this to be $1$, we choose $c = 1/\\sqrt{2\\pi}$. The normalized eigenfunction is $\\phi_0(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$.\n- For $\\lambda_n = n^2$ ($n \\ge 1$), the basis functions are $\\cos(nx)$ and $\\sin(nx)$. They are orthogonal: $\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos(nx)\\sin(nx)dx = 0$. We normalize them:\n$\\|\\cos(nx)\\|^2 = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos^2(nx) dx = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1+\\cos(2nx)}{2} dx = \\pi$.\n$\\|\\sin(nx)\\|^2 = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2(nx) dx = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1-\\cos(2nx)}{2} dx = \\pi$.\nThe normalized eigenfunctions for $\\lambda_n=n^2$ are $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\cos(nx)$ and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\sin(nx)$.\nThe complete orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions in $L^2(S^1)$ is the set:\n$$\n\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\right\\} \\cup \\left\\{ \\frac{\\cos(nx)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}, \\frac{\\sin(nx)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\right\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}.\n$$\n\nSpectral Zeta Function:\nThe spectral zeta function $\\zeta_{\\Delta}(s)$ is defined as the sum over the non-zero eigenvalues, counted with multiplicity:\n$$\n\\zeta_{\\Delta}(s) = \\sum_{\\lambda \\in \\sigma(\\Delta) \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\lambda^{-s}.\n$$\nThe non-zero eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = n^2$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$, each with multiplicity $2$. Thus,\n$$\n\\zeta_{\\Delta}(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2 \\cdot (n^2)^{-s} = 2 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-2s}.\n$$\nThe Riemann zeta function is defined for $\\text{Re}(z) > 1$ as $\\zeta(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k^{-z}$. We can therefore express $\\zeta_{\\Delta}(s)$ in terms of the Riemann zeta function:\n$$\n\\zeta_{\\Delta}(s) = 2 \\zeta(2s).\n$$\nIt is a fundamental result in analytic number theory that the Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(z)$ admits a meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$, with its only pole being a simple pole at $z=1$ with residue $1$.\nThe function $g(s) = 2s$ is an entire function. Therefore, the composite function $\\zeta_{\\Delta}(s) = 2\\zeta(2s)$ is also meromorphic on $\\mathbb{C}$. Its poles occur where $2s=1$, i.e., at $s=1/2$. This shows that $\\zeta_{\\Delta}(s)$ has a meromorphic continuation to $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nEvaluation of $\\zeta_{\\Delta}(0)$:\nWe use the expression derived above:\n$$\n\\zeta_{\\Delta}(0) = 2 \\zeta(2 \\cdot 0) = 2 \\zeta(0).\n$$\nA well-established property of the analytically continued Riemann zeta function is its value at $s=0$. This value can be derived from the functional equation for $\\zeta(s)$. The result is:\n$$\n\\zeta(0) = -\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nSubstituting this value into our expression for $\\zeta_{\\Delta}(0)$, we find:\n$$\n\\zeta_{\\Delta}(0) = 2 \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right) = -1.\n$$\nThe exact value of $\\zeta_{\\Delta}(0)$ is $-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "3063344"}]}
