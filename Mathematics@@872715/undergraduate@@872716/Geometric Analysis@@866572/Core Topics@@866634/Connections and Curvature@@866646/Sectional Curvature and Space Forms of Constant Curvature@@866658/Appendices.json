Provide the final value of the sectional curvature only as your answer. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid, self-contained, and scientifically sound. We proceed with the solution by following the fundamental definitions of Riemannian geometry as requested.\n\nThe manifold is $M=\\mathbb{S}^{1}(r)\\times \\mathbb{R}$, which is a cylinder of radius $r0$. The local coordinates are given as $(x^{1}, x^{2}) = (\\theta, z)$. The Riemannian metric is given by $g=r^{2}\\,d\\theta^{2}+dz^{2}$.\n\nThe components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ in these coordinates are:\n$g_{11} = g_{\\theta\\theta} = r^{2}$\n$g_{22} = g_{zz} = 1$\n$g_{12} = g_{21} = g_{\\theta z} = 0$\n\nThe metric tensor can be written as a matrix:\n$$\ng_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} r^{2}  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe inverse metric tensor, $g^{ij}$, is the inverse of this matrix:\n$$\ng^{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} r^{-2}  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe first step is to compute the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}$, for the Levi-Civita connection. The formula is:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{ij}^{k} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^{i}} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^{j}} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^{l}} \\right)\n$$\nIn our case, the coordinates are $x^{1}=\\theta$ and $x^{2}=z$. The components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ are all constants ($r$ is a constant parameter). Therefore, all partial derivatives of the metric components with respect to the coordinates are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^{k}} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i, j, k \\in \\{1, 2\\}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the formula for the Christoffel symbols, we find that all of them are identically zero:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{ij}^{k} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i, j, k \\in \\{1, 2\\}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the components of the Riemann curvature tensor, $R_{ijk}^{l}$. The formula is:\n$$\nR_{ijk}^{l} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma_{jk}^{l}}{\\partial x^{i}} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma_{ik}^{l}}{\\partial x^{j}} + \\sum_{s=1}^{2} \\left( \\Gamma_{is}^{l} \\Gamma_{jk}^{s} - \\Gamma_{js}^{l} \\Gamma_{ik}^{s} \\right)\n$$\nSince all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}$ are zero, their partial derivatives are also zero. The summation term consists of products of Christoffel symbols, which are also zero. Consequently, all components of the Riemann curvature tensor are zero:\n$$\nR_{ijk}^{l} = 0 - 0 + 0 - 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i, j, k, l \\in \\{1, 2\\}\n$$\n\nThe sectional curvature $K_{p}(\\sigma)$ at a point $p \\in M$ for a $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_{p}M$ is given by\n$$\nK_{p}(\\sigma) = \\frac{g(R(u,v)v, u)}{g(u,u)g(v,v) - (g(u,v))^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\{u, v\\}$ is any basis for the plane $\\sigma$. Since the manifold $M$ is $2$-dimensional, at any point $p$, the tangent space $T_{p}M$ is a $2$-dimensional vector space. Thus, there is only one $2$-plane $\\sigma$ at each point, namely $\\sigma = T_{p}M$ itself. We can choose the coordinate basis vectors $u = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$ and $v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ to span this plane.\n\nIn terms of components, the formula for the sectional curvature is:\n$$\nK_p(\\sigma) = \\frac{R_{1212}}{g_{11}g_{22} - (g_{12})^{2}}\n$$\nHere, $R_{1212}$ is the fully covariant component of the Riemann tensor, defined as $R_{1212} = g_{1l}R_{212}^{l}$. Since all components $R_{ijk}^{l}$ are zero, it follows that all fully covariant components are also zero:\n$$\nR_{ijkl} = g_{lm} R_{ijk}^{m} = g_{lm} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nIn particular, $R_{1212} = R_{\\theta z \\theta z} = 0$.\n\nThe denominator is calculated from the metric components:\n$$\ng_{11}g_{22} - (g_{12})^{2} = g_{\\theta\\theta}g_{zz} - (g_{\\theta z})^{2} = (r^{2})(1) - (0)^{2} = r^{2}\n$$\nSince $r0$, the denominator is non-zero, and the expression is well-defined.\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula for sectional curvature, we get:\n$$\nK_{p}(\\sigma) = \\frac{0}{r^{2}} = 0\n$$\nThis result is independent of the point $p$ and the radius $r$. The sectional curvature of the cylinder $M=\\mathbb{S}^{1}(r)\\times \\mathbb{R}$ is constant and equal to $0$ everywhere.\n\n**Geometric Interpretation:**\nA Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature equal to $0$ is called a *flat* manifold. This means that, locally, the geometry of the cylinder is identical to that of the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Any small enough region on the cylinder can be \"unrolled\" onto a plane without any distortion of distances or angles; this unrolling is a local isometry. The fact that all Christoffel symbols vanished in our chosen coordinate system is a direct manifestation of this local flatness.\n\nThe problem also mentions \"space forms of constant curvature\". A space form is, by standard definition, a **complete and simply connected** Riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature.\n1.  **Constant Curvature:** The cylinder $M$ has constant sectional curvature $K=0$.\n2.  **Completeness:** The metric on $M$ is the product of the standard metrics on $\\mathbb{S}^{1}(r)$ and $\\mathbb{R}$, both of which are complete manifolds. The product of complete manifolds is complete. So, $M$ is complete.\n3.  **Simple Connectedness:** The manifold $M = \\mathbb{S}^{1}(r) \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is homotopy equivalent to a circle, $\\mathbb{S}^{1}$. Its fundamental group is $\\pi_{1}(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, which is not trivial. Loops that wrap around the circumference of the cylinder cannot be continuously shrunk to a point. Therefore, $M$ is **not** simply connected.\n\nBecause it is not simply connected, the cylinder $M$ is not a space form. It is, however, a classic example of a complete flat manifold that is not a space form. By the Killing-Hopf theorem, any complete, connected manifold of constant curvature is isometric to a quotient $\\tilde{M}/\\Gamma$, where $\\tilde{M}$ is the corresponding space form and $\\Gamma$ is a discrete group of isometries. In our case, the $2$-dimensional space form of curvature $0$ is the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The cylinder is isometric to the quotient $\\mathbb{R}^{2}/\\Gamma$, where $\\Gamma$ is the group of integer translations in one direction, e.g., $\\Gamma = \\{ (x,y) \\mapsto (x+n \\cdot 2\\pi r, y) \\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$.\n\nIn summary, the value $K=0$ signifies that the cylinder is locally Euclidean (flat), but its global topology (being a cylinder, not a plane) prevents it from being a space form itself, though it is intimately related to one via a quotient construction. The radius $r$ affects the global geometry (the circumference $2\\pi r$) but, as shown, has no effect on the local curvature.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3061768"}, {"introduction": "Having explored a flat space, we now tackle a more surprising scenario involving a seemingly complex metric defined on the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.

For a $2$-dimensional manifold, the Gaussian curvature $K$ is related to the sole independent component of the Riemann tensor, for instance $R_{1212}$, by:\n$$K = \\frac{R_{1212}}{\\det(g)}$$\nThe $(0,4)$ Riemann tensor $R_{klij}$ is related to the $(1,3)$ tensor $R^m_{lij}$ by $R_{klij} = g_{km}R^m_{lij}$. Thus, $R_{1212} = g_{1m}R^m_{212} = g_{11}R^1_{212} + g_{12}R^2_{212}$. Since $g_{12}=0$, this simplifies to $R_{1212} = g_{11}R^1_{212}$.

For any such plane, the sectional curvature of the corresponding plane in the fiber $(\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}, g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}})$ is $1$. The sectional curvature of the tangential plane in $M$, denoted by $K_{tan}$, is:\n    $$K_{tan}(r) = \\frac{1 - \\|\\text{grad } f\\|^2}{f(r)^2} = \\frac{1 - (f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2}.$$\n\nNext, we require the manifold to have constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$. This means that the sectional curvature is independent of the point and the choice of the $2$-plane at that point. Therefore, we must have $K_{rad} = K_{tan} = \\kappa$. This gives a system of two differential equations for $f(r)$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} = \\kappa  (1) \\\\\n\\frac{1 - (f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} = \\kappa  (2)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nEquation ($1$) can be written as $f''(r) + \\kappa f(r) = 0$. This is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE).\nEquation ($2$) can be written as $(f'(r))^2 + \\kappa f(r)^2 = 1$.\nThese two equations are not independent. Differentiating the second equation with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$2f'(r)f''(r) + \\kappa(2f(r)f'(r)) = 0$$\nAssuming $f'(r)$ is not identically zero (which would imply $f$ is constant, a case that only works for $\\kappa=0$ and is not general), we can divide by $2f'(r)$ to obtain:\n$$f''(r) + \\kappa f(r) = 0$$\nwhich is the first equation. Thus, the condition for constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$ is that $f(r)$ must satisfy the ODE $f''(r) + \\kappa f(r) = 0$, along with the first-order constraint $(f'(r))^2 + \\kappa f(r)^2 = 1$. The ODE is the primary governing equation.\n\nFor the metric $g = dr^2 + f(r)^2 g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$ to be smooth at $r=0$, extending the coordinate chart to include a \"pole\" at the origin around which $(r, \\omega)$ are geodesic polar coordinates, the function $f(r)$ must satisfy certain regularity conditions. In a neighborhood of the origin, a smooth Riemannian metric must be approximated by the Euclidean metric. The Euclidean metric in polar coordinates is $dr^2 + r^2 g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$. By comparing this with the given metric, we see that $f(r)$ must behave like $r$ for small $r$. A rigorous analysis shows that the metric is smooth at the pole if and only if $f(r)$ is a smooth, odd function of $r$. The Taylor series expansion of $f(r)$ around $r=0$ must begin as $f(r) = r + O(r^3)$. This implies the following conditions at $r=0$:\n1.  $f(0) = 0$: This ensures the sphere of radius $r=0$ shrinks to a point.\n2.  $f'(0) = 1$: This ensures the metric is locally Euclidean at the pole, avoiding a conical singularity.\n\nThese two conditions, $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$, are the required regularity conditions. Note that these conditions, together with the ODE $f''(r) + \\kappa f(r)=0$, automatically imply that $f$ is an odd function, as $f''(0) = -\\kappa f(0) = 0$, $f'''(0) = -\\kappa f'(0) = -\\kappa$, and so on, with all even-order derivatives at $r=0$ vanishing.\n\nFinally, we specialize to the case of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa = -1$. The ODE becomes:\n$$f''(r) - f(r) = 0$$\nThe general solution to this linear ODE can be written as $f(r) = A e^r + B e^{-r}$ or, more conveniently for initial value problems at $r=0$, in terms of hyperbolic functions:\n$$f(r) = C \\cosh(r) + D \\sinh(r)$$\nwhere $C$ and $D$ are constants. We apply the regularity conditions to determine these constants.\n1.  Using $f(0)=0$:\n    $$f(0) = C \\cosh(0) + D \\sinh(0) = C \\cdot 1 + D \\cdot 0 = C$$\n    Thus, we must have $C=0$. The function is of the form $f(r) = D \\sinh(r)$.\n2.  Using $f'(0)=1$:\n    The derivative is $f'(r) = D \\cosh(r)$.\n    $$f'(0) = D \\cosh(0) = D \\cdot 1 = D$$\n    Thus, we must have $D=1$.\n\nThe unique smooth warping function for $\\kappa=-1$ satisfying the regularity conditions is $f(r) = \\sinh(r)$. This results in the standard metric for $n$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sinh(r)}$$", "id": "3061722"}]}
