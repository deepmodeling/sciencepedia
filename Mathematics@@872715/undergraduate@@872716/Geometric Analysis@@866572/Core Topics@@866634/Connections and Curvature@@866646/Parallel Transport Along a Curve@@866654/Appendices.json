The metric tensor is $g_{11}=1$, $g_{22}=r^2$, $g_{12}=0$. The inverse is $g^{11}=1$, $g^{22}=1/r^2$. The only non-zero partial derivative of the metric components is $\\partial_r g_{\\theta\\theta} = 2r$.\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n$$\n\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} (-\\partial_r g_{\\theta\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{2}(1)(-2r) = -r\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\theta\\theta} (\\partial_r g_{\\theta\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{r^2} (2r) = \\frac{1}{r}\n$$\nAll other $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are zero.\n\nThe curve is $\\gamma_1(t) = (R, \\omega t)$, so $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t) = (\\frac{dr}{dt}, \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}) = (0, \\omega)$.\n\n**Analysis on $M_2 = (S^2, ds^2 = d\\varphi^2 + \\sin^2(\\varphi) d\\theta^2)$**\n\nLet $(x^1, x^2) = (\\varphi, \\theta)$. The metric is $g_{11}=1$, $g_{22}=\\sin^2(\\varphi)$, $g_{12}=0$. The inverse is $g^{11}=1$, $g^{22}=1/\\sin^2(\\varphi)$. The only non-zero partial derivative of the metric components is $\\partial_\\varphi g_{\\theta\\theta} = 2 \\sin(\\varphi) \\cos(\\varphi)$.\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n$$\n\\Gamma^\\varphi_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\varphi\\varphi} (-\\partial_\\varphi g_{\\theta\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{2}(1)(-2 \\sin(\\varphi) \\cos(\\varphi)) = -\\sin(\\varphi)\\cos(\\varphi)\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\varphi\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta\\varphi} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\theta\\theta} (\\partial_\\varphi g_{\\theta\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{\\sin^2(\\varphi)} (2 \\sin(\\varphi) \\cos(\\varphi)) = \\cot(\\varphi)\n$$\nAll other $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are zero.\n\nThe curve is $\\gamma_2(t) = (\\varphi_0, \\omega t)$, so $\\dot{\\gamma}_2(t) = (\\frac{d\\varphi}{dt}, \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}) = (0, \\omega)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe parallel transport equation for a vector field $V(t) = (V^r(t), V^\\theta(t))$ or $(V^\\varphi(t), V^\\theta(t))$ along a curve $\\gamma(t)$ is $\\frac{dV^k}{dt} + \\sum_{i,j} \\Gamma^k_{ij} V^i \\frac{d\\gamma^j}{dt} = 0$. The geodesic equation for a curve $\\gamma(t)$ is $\\frac{d^2\\gamma^k}{dt^2} + \\sum_{i,j} \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{d\\gamma^i}{dt} \\frac{d\\gamma^j}{dt} = 0$.\n\n**A. On $M_1$, the vector field $V(t)$ along $\\gamma_1$ with constant polar components $V^r(t) = 0$ and $V^\\theta(t) = c$ (for a constant $c \\neq 0$) is parallel transported along $\\gamma_1$.**\n\nWe test the parallel transport equations for $V(t) = (0, c)$ along $\\gamma_1(t)=(R, \\omega t)$.\nHere, $\\frac{dV^r}{dt}=0$, $\\frac{dV^\\theta}{dt}=0$, $\\dot{r}=0$, $\\dot{\\theta}=\\omega$.\nFor $k=r$:\n$$ \\frac{dV^r}{dt} + \\Gamma^r_{rr}V^r\\dot{r} + \\Gamma^r_{r\\theta}V^r\\dot{\\theta} + \\Gamma^r_{\\theta r}V^\\theta\\dot{r} + \\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}V^\\theta\\dot{\\theta} = 0 $$\n$$ 0 + (0)(0)(0) + (0)(0)(\\omega) + (\\frac{1}{R})(c)(0) + (-R)(c)(\\omega) = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to $-R c \\omega = 0$. Since $R>0$, $c \\neq 0$, and $\\omega \\neq 0$ are given, the product $-R c \\omega$ is non-zero. The equation is not satisfied. The vector field is not parallel transported.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. On $M_1$, the circle $\\gamma_1(t) = (R, \\omega t)$ is a geodesic.**\n\nWe test the geodesic equations for $\\gamma_1(t)=(R, \\omega t)$.\nHere, $\\ddot{r}=0$, $\\ddot{\\theta}=0$, $\\dot{r}=0$, $\\dot{\\theta}=\\omega$.\nFor $k=r$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2r}{dt^2} + \\Gamma^r_{rr}\\dot{r}^2 + 2\\Gamma^r_{r\\theta}\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} + \\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}\\dot{\\theta}^2 = 0 $$\n$$ 0 + (0)(0)^2 + 2(0)(0)(\\omega) + (-R)(\\omega)^2 = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to $-R \\omega^2 = 0$. Since $R>0$ and $\\omega\\neq 0$, the product $-R \\omega^2$ is non-zero. The equation is not satisfied. The circle is not a geodesic. This is expected, as geodesics in the Euclidean plane are straight lines.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. On $M_1$, if a vector field along $\\gamma_1$ has constant components in the polar coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_r,\\partial_\\theta\\}$, then it is parallel transported along $\\gamma_1$.**\n\nLet $V(t) = (c_1, c_2)$ for constants $c_1, c_2$. We test the parallel transport equations.\nFor $k=r$: As shown in the analysis for A, the equation is $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} V^\\theta \\dot{\\theta} = -R c_2 \\omega = 0$. This requires $c_2 = 0$.\nFor $k=\\theta$:\n$$ \\frac{dV^\\theta}{dt} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{rr}V^r\\dot{r} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta}V^r\\dot{\\theta} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r}V^\\theta\\dot{r} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta\\theta}V^\\theta\\dot{\\theta} = 0 $$\n$$ 0 + (0)(c_1)(0) + (\\frac{1}{R})(c_1)(\\omega) + (\\frac{1}{R})(c_2)(0) + (0)(c_2)(\\omega) = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{c_1 \\omega}{R} = 0$. This requires $c_1 = 0$.\nFor a general vector field with constant components to be parallel transported, we must have $c_1=0$ and $c_2=0$. This means only the zero vector field satisfies the condition. The statement implies this is true for any such vector field, which is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. On $M_2$, the latitude circle $\\gamma_2(t) = (\\varphi_0, \\omega t)$ is a geodesic if and only if $\\varphi_0 = \\pi/2$.**\n\nWe test the geodesic equations for $\\gamma_2(t) = (\\varphi_0, \\omega t)$.\nHere, $\\ddot{\\varphi}=0$, $\\ddot{\\theta}=0$, $\\dot{\\varphi}=0$, $\\dot{\\theta}=\\omega$.\nFor $k=\\varphi$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\varphi}{dt^2} + \\Gamma^\\varphi_{\\varphi\\varphi}\\dot{\\varphi}^2 + 2\\Gamma^\\varphi_{\\varphi\\theta}\\dot{\\varphi}\\dot{\\theta} + \\Gamma^\\varphi_{\\theta\\theta}\\dot{\\theta}^2 = 0 $$\n$$ 0 + (0)(0)^2 + 2(0)(0)(\\omega) + (-\\sin(\\varphi_0)\\cos(\\varphi_0))(\\omega)^2 = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to $-\\omega^2 \\sin(\\varphi_0)\\cos(\\varphi_0) = 0$. Since $\\omega \\neq 0$ and $\\varphi_0 \\in (0, \\pi)$ (so $\\sin(\\varphi_0) > 0$), this equation holds if and only if $\\cos(\\varphi_0) = 0$. For $\\varphi_0 \\in (0, \\pi)$, this occurs precisely when $\\varphi_0 = \\pi/2$.\nFor $k=\\theta$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\varphi\\varphi}\\dot{\\varphi}^2 + 2\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\varphi\\theta}\\dot{\\varphi}\\dot{\\theta} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta\\theta}\\dot{\\theta}^2 = 0 $$\n$$ 0 + (0)(0)^2 + 2(\\cot(\\varphi_0))(0)(\\omega) + (0)(\\omega)^2 = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to $0=0$, which is always satisfied.\nThus, the curve $\\gamma_2(t)$ is a geodesic if and only if the $\\varphi$-component equation is satisfied, which is if and only if $\\varphi_0 = \\pi/2$. This corresponds to the equator, which is a great circle and thus a geodesic.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. On $M_2$, there exists a nonzero vector field along $\\gamma_2$ with constant components in the coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_\\varphi,\\partial_\\theta\\}$ that is also parallel transported along $\\gamma_2$ for some choice of $\\varphi_0 \\neq \\pi/2$.**\n\nLet $V(t) = (c_1, c_2)$ be a nonzero vector field, so $(c_1, c_2) \\neq (0, 0)$. We test the parallel transport equations along $\\gamma_2(t) = (\\varphi_0, \\omega t)$.\n$\\frac{dV^\\varphi}{dt}=0$, $\\frac{dV^\\theta}{dt}=0$, $\\dot{\\varphi}=0$, $\\dot{\\theta}=\\omega$.\nFor $k=\\varphi$:\n$$ \\frac{dV^\\varphi}{dt} + \\Gamma^\\varphi_{\\varphi\\varphi}V^\\varphi\\dot{\\varphi} + \\Gamma^\\varphi_{\\varphi\\theta}V^\\varphi\\dot{\\theta} + \\Gamma^\\varphi_{\\theta\\varphi}V^\\theta\\dot{\\varphi} + \\Gamma^\\varphi_{\\theta\\theta}V^\\theta\\dot{\\theta} = 0 $$\n$$ 0 + (0)(c_1)(0) + (0)(c_1)(\\omega) + (0)(c_2)(0) + (-\\sin(\\varphi_0)\\cos(\\varphi_0))(c_2)(\\omega) = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to $-\\omega c_2 \\sin(\\varphi_0)\\cos(\\varphi_0) = 0$.\nFor $k=\\theta$:\n$$ \\frac{dV^\\theta}{dt} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\varphi\\varphi}V^\\varphi\\dot{\\varphi} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\varphi\\theta}V^\\varphi\\dot{\\theta} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta\\varphi}V^\\theta\\dot{\\varphi} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta\\theta}V^\\theta\\dot{\\theta} = 0 $$\n$$ 0 + (0)(c_1)(0) + (\\cot(\\varphi_0))(c_1)(\\omega) + (\\cot(\\varphi_0))(c_2)(0) + (0)(c_2)(\\omega) = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to $\\omega c_1 \\cot(\\varphi_0) = 0$, which is $\\omega c_1 \\frac{\\cos(\\varphi_0)}{\\sin(\\varphi_0)}=0$.\nThe problem specifies a choice of $\\varphi_0 \\neq \\pi/2$. For such $\\varphi_0 \\in (0, \\pi)$, we have $\\cos(\\varphi_0) \\neq 0$ and $\\sin(\\varphi_0) \\neq 0$. Also $\\omega \\neq 0$.\nThe first equation, $-\\omega c_2 \\sin(\\varphi_0)\\cos(\\varphi_0) = 0$, implies $c_2 = 0$.\nThe second equation, $\\omega c_1 \\cot(\\varphi_0) = 0$, implies $c_1 = 0$.\nTherefore, for any choice of $\\varphi_0 \\neq \\pi/2$, the only vector field with constant components that is parallel transported along $\\gamma_2$ is the one with $c_1=0$ and $c_2=0$, i.e., the zero vector field. The statement requires a *nonzero* vector field. No such vector field exists.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "3058576"}]}
