The problem provides the definitions of the Riemann curvature tensor $R$, the sectional curvature $K$, the Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$, and the scalar curvature $S$.\n\nA manifold of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$ is characterized by a specific form of its Riemann curvature tensor. For any tangent vectors $X, Y, Z$ at a point $p \\in M$, the $(1,3)$-tensor $R$ is given by:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = \\kappa \\left( g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y \\right)\n$$\nWe can verify that this formula is consistent with the provided definition of sectional curvature. Let $\\{u,v\\}$ be an orthonormal pair of vectors spanning a $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p M$. The sectional curvature is defined as $K(\\sigma) = g(R(u,v)v, u)$. Using the formula for $R$:\n$$\ng(R(u,v)v, u) = g(\\kappa(g(v,v)u - g(u,v)v), u)\n$$\nSince $u$ and $v$ are orthonormal, $g(u,u) = 1$, $g(v,v) = 1$, and $g(u,v) = 0$. Substituting these values gives:\n$$\ng(\\kappa(1 \\cdot u - 0 \\cdot v), u) = g(\\kappa u, u) = \\kappa g(u,u) = \\kappa \\cdot 1 = \\kappa\n$$\nThis confirms that the formula for $R$ correctly reproduces the constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$. The problem statement mentions Schur's lemma, which for $n \\ge 3$ ensures that if the sectional curvature at each point is isotropic (independent of the $2$-plane), it must be constant throughout the connected manifold. Here, we are given that the sectional curvature is a global constant $\\kappa$, so this condition is already satisfied.\n\nNext, we compute the Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$. Let $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_p M$. The Ricci tensor component $\\operatorname{Ric}(e_j, e_j)$ for a basis vector $e_j$ is given by the trace of the curvature operator:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(e_j, e_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g(R(e_j, e_i)e_i, e_j)\n$$\nWe can analyze the terms in this summation.\nThe term for $i=j$ is $g(R(e_j, e_j)e_j, e_j)$. The Riemann tensor is antisymmetric in its first two arguments, so $R(e_j, e_j)Z = 0$ for any vector $Z$. Thus, this term is $0$.\n\nThe sum is therefore taken over all indices $i \\neq j$. For each such term, we use the explicit formula for $R$:\n$$\ng(R(e_j, e_i)e_i, e_j) = g(\\kappa(g(e_i, e_i)e_j - g(e_j, e_i)e_i), e_j)\n$$\nSince $\\{e_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, we have $g(e_i, e_i) = 1$ and $g(e_j, e_i) = \\delta_{ji}$. As we are considering $i \\neq j$, $g(e_j, e_i) = 0$. Substituting these values:\n$$\ng(\\kappa(1 \\cdot e_j - 0 \\cdot e_i), e_j) = g(\\kappa e_j, e_j) = \\kappa g(e_j, e_j) = \\kappa \\cdot 1 = \\kappa\n$$\nEach term in the sum for $i \\neq j$ is equal to $\\kappa$. There are $n-1$ such terms (for $i=1, \\dots, n$ with $i \\neq j$). Therefore, the Ricci curvature in the direction $e_j$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(e_j, e_j) = \\sum_{i=1, i \\neq j}^{n} \\kappa = (n-1)\\kappa\n$$\nSince the choice of orthonormal basis was arbitrary, this holds for any unit vector. This implies that the Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric, $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1)\\kappa g$, and the manifold is an Einstein manifold.\n\nFinally, we compute the scalar curvature $S$, which is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric $g$. Using the same orthonormal basis $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\operatorname{Ric}(e_j, e_j)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression we found for $\\operatorname{Ric}(e_j, e_j)$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (n-1)\\kappa\n$$\nThe term $(n-1)\\kappa$ is a constant with respect to the summation index $j$. We are summing this constant term $n$ times:\n$$\nS = n(n-1)\\kappa\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the scalar curvature of a manifold of dimension $n$ with constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$.

In local coordinates, this is $S = g^{ij}\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}$.\nSubstituting the expression for the Ricci tensor:\n$$S = g^{ij}(K g_{ij}) = K (g^{ij}g_{ij}) = K \\delta^i_i = K \\cdot \\operatorname{dim}(M) = 2K$$\nSo, for any surface, the scalar curvature is twice the Gaussian curvature.\n\nThe statement becomes:\n$$ \\int_{M} (2K)\\, d\\mu_{g} = 4\\pi\\, \\chi(M) $$\nDividing by $2$, we get:\n$$ \\int_{M} K\\, d\\mu_{g} = 2\\pi\\, \\chi(M) $$\nThis is the celebrated Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a closed, oriented surface $M$.

The identity states that for any Riemannian manifold, the divergence of the Ricci tensor is related to the gradient of the scalar curvature:\n$$ \\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{Ric}) = \\frac{1}{2} dS $$\nIn local coordinates, this is $\\nabla^{j}\\operatorname{Ric}_{ji} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_{i}S$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the scalar curvature $S$ from the given condition $\\operatorname{Ric} = \\varphi g$:\n$$ S = \\operatorname{tr}_{g}(\\operatorname{Ric}) = g^{ij}\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = g^{ij}(\\varphi g_{ij}) = \\varphi (g^{ij}g_{ij}) = \\varphi \\delta^{i}_{i} = n\\varphi $$\nThus, $S = n\\varphi$. The right-hand side of the Bianchi identity becomes $\\frac{1}{2} d(n\\varphi) = \\frac{n}{2} d\\varphi$.\n\nNext, let's compute the divergence of the Ricci tensor from the condition $\\operatorname{Ric} = \\varphi g$. Using the product rule and the fact that the metric is covariant constant ($\\nabla g = 0$):\n$$ (\\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{Ric}))_{i} = \\nabla^{j}\\operatorname{Ric}_{ji} = \\nabla^{j}(\\varphi g_{ji}) = (\\nabla^{j}\\varphi)g_{ji} + \\varphi(\\nabla^{j}g_{ji}) $$\nSince $\\nabla g = 0$, the second term vanishes. This gives:\n$$ (\\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{Ric}))_{i} = g^{jk}(\\nabla_{k}\\varphi)g_{ji} = \\delta^{k}_{i}(\\nabla_{k}\\varphi) = \\nabla_{i}\\varphi $$\nThis means $\\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{Ric}) = d\\varphi$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the divergence of the Ricci tensor:\n$$ d\\varphi = \\frac{n}{2} d\\varphi $$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$ \\left(1 - \\frac{n}{2}\\right) d\\varphi = 0 $$\nThe problem specifies that the dimension $n \\geq 3$. For any such $n$, the pre-factor $\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{2}\\right)$ is non-zero. For example, if $n=3$, it is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, we must have $d\\varphi = 0$. On a connected manifold, $d\\varphi=0$ implies that the function $\\varphi$ is constant. This result is a variation of Schur's Lemma.\n\nVerdict for B: **Correct**.\n\n**Statement C: If $\\left(M^{2},g\\right)$ is connected and satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric} = \\varphi\\, g$ for a smooth function $\\varphi$, then $\\varphi$ must be constant on $M$.**\n\nLet's re-examine the argument from statement B for the case $n=2$. The identity derived from the contracted second Bianchi identity is $\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{2}\\right) d\\varphi = 0$.\nWhen $n=2$, this becomes:\n$$ \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{2}\\right) d\\varphi = (1-1)d\\varphi = 0 \\cdot d\\varphi = 0 $$\nThis equation is a tautology ($0=0$) and imposes no restriction on $d\\varphi$. Thus, $\\varphi$ is not necessarily constant.\n\nAs established in the analysis of statement A, for any $2$-dimensional manifold, we have $\\operatorname{Ric} = K g$, where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature. So, the condition $\\operatorname{Ric} = \\varphi g$ is always satisfied with $\\varphi = K$.\nThe statement is therefore equivalent to asserting that the Gaussian curvature $K$ of any connected surface must be constant. This is demonstrably false.\nFor a counterexample, consider an ellipsoid of revolution that is not a sphere. Its Gaussian curvature is a non-constant function of position. Yet, it is a connected surface that satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric} = K(x) g$.\n\nVerdict for C: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Statement D: For any closed oriented surface $\\left(M^{2},g\\right)$ with $S \\geq 0$ everywhere, the Euler characteristic satisfies $\\chi(M) \\geq 0$.**\n\nAs shown in the analysis of statement A, the scalar curvature $S$ and Gaussian curvature $K$ of a surface are related by $S = 2K$.\nThe condition $S \\ge 0$ everywhere is equivalent to the condition $K \\ge 0$ everywhere.\nThe Gauss-Bonnet theorem states:\n$$ \\int_{M} K\\, d\\mu_{g} = 2\\pi\\, \\chi(M) $$\nIf $K \\ge 0$ for all points on $M$, and since the volume form $d\\mu_g$ is everywhere positive, the integrand $K$ is non-negative. Therefore, the integral must also be non-negative:\n$$ \\int_{M} K\\, d\\mu_{g} \\geq 0 $$\nThis implies $2\\pi\\, \\chi(M) \\geq 0$, which in turn means $\\chi(M) \\geq 0$.\nFor instance, the sphere $S^2$ has $K > 0$ and $\\chi(S^2) = 2 \\ge 0$. The torus $T^2$ can be equipped with a flat metric where $K=0$ everywhere, and $\\chi(T^2) = 0 \\ge 0$. Surfaces of genus $g \\ge 2$ have $\\chi = 2-2g  0$, and by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, they cannot admit a metric with $K \\ge 0$ everywhere.\n\nVerdict for D: **Correct**.\n\n**Statement E: If $\\left(M^{n},g\\right)$ is connected and has constant scalar curvature $S \\equiv c$, then it has constant sectional curvature.**\n\nThis statement is false. A manifold with constant sectional curvature has a very restricted geometry. Its Riemann curvature tensor is of the form $R_{ijkl} = C(g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk})$. This implies that the Ricci tensor is $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1)Cg$ and the scalar curvature is $S = n(n-1)C$, both of which are constant multiples of the metric or constant functions. The converse, however, is not true. Having constant scalar curvature is a much weaker condition.\n\nA standard counterexample is the product manifold $M = S^k \\times S^l$ with the standard product metric, where $S^k$ is the $k$-dimensional sphere with radius $1$.\nLet's consider $M = S^2 \\times S^2$, a $4$-dimensional manifold. The scalar curvature of a product manifold $M_1 \\times M_2$ is $S_{M_1 \\times M_2} = S_{M_1} + S_{M_2}$.\nFor the standard $2$-sphere $S^2$ with radius $1$, the Gaussian curvature is $K=1$, so its scalar curvature is $S_{S^2} = 2K = 2$.\nThus, the scalar curvature of $S^2 \\times S^2$ is $S = 2+2=4$, which is constant.\nHowever, $S^2 \\times S^2$ does not have constant sectional curvature.\nTo see this, consider a $2$-plane $\\Pi$ at a point $(p,q) \\in S^2 \\times S^2$.\n-   If $\\Pi$ is spanned by two orthonormal vectors both tangent to the first $S^2$ factor, its sectional curvature is the Gaussian curvature of that $S^2$, which is $1$.\n-   If $\\Pi$ is spanned by one vector tangent to the first $S^2$ and one vector tangent to the second $S^2$, its sectional curvature is $0$.\nSince the sectional curvature can take different values (e.g., $1$ and $0$), it is not constant.\nTherefore, $S^2 \\times S^2$ is a connected manifold with constant scalar curvature that does not have constant sectional curvature.\n\nVerdict for E: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Summary**\n-   Statement A: True.\n-   Statement B: True.\n-   Statement C: False.\n-   Statement D: True.\n-   Statement E: False.\n\nThe true statements are A, B, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "3061253"}, {"introduction": "This final practice takes our understanding to the next level by exploring a more complex and physically significant class of manifolds.

Then $f'(r)=0$ and $f''(r)=0$. The formula gives $R(g) = \\frac{m(m-1)\\kappa}{c^2} = \\frac{\\bar{R}}{c^2}$. This is correct, as $(M,g)$ becomes the product manifold $(\\mathbb{R}, dr^2) \\times (F, c^2 g_F)$. The scalar curvature of a product is the sum of the scalar curvatures of the factors. $R(\\mathbb{R}) = 0$. The scalar curvature of $(F, c^2 g_F)$ is $c^{-2} \\bar{R}$, as scaling a metric by a constant $c^2$ scales its scalar curvature by $c^{-2}$. Thus, $R(g) = 0 + c^{-2}\\bar{R}$, which matches our result.\n\nThe mention of Schur's lemma for dimension $m+1 \\ge 3$ is also consistent. If we impose the condition that all sectional curvatures are equal to a constant $C$ at a point, we get a differential equation for $f(r)$. For example, taking $m+1=3$ (so $m=2$), isotropy requires $K(E_1, E_2) = K(E_0, E_1)$, which means $\\frac{\\kappa}{f^2} - (\\frac{f'}{f})^2 = -\\frac{f''}{f}$. This is the condition for space forms, which are the only manifolds with constant sectional curvature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{m(m-1)\\kappa}{f(r)^2} - \\frac{m(m-1)f'(r)^2}{f(r)^2} - \\frac{2mf''(r)}{f(r)}}$$", "id": "3061255"}]}
