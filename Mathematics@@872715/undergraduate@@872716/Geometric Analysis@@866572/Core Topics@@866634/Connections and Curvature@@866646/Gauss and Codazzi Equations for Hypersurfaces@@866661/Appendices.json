Therefore, the components of the second fundamental form in the basis of principal directions are:\n$$h_{ij} = \\kappa_i \\delta_{ij}$$\nThis shows that the matrix representation of the second fundamental form is diagonal in this basis, with the principal curvatures as its diagonal entries. Specifically, $h_{ii} = \\kappa_i$ and $h_{ij} = 0$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe next step is to use the Gauss equation. The Gauss equation relates the intrinsic Riemann curvature tensor $R$ of the hypersurface $M^n$ to the curvature tensor $\\bar{R}$ of the ambient space $\\bar{M}$ and the second fundamental form $h$. For any tangent vectors $X, Y, Z, W \\in T_pM^n$, the equation is:\n$$\\langle R(X,Y)Z, W \\rangle = \\langle \\bar{R}(X,Y)Z, W \\rangle + h(X,W)h(Y,Z) - h(X,Z)h(Y,W)$$\nThe ambient space $\\bar{M}^{n+1}$ is a space form of constant sectional curvature $c$. This implies its Riemann curvature tensor has a specific, simple form:\n$$\\bar{R}(X,Y)Z = c(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y)$$\nTaking the inner product with $W$ gives:\n$$\\langle \\bar{R}(X,Y)Z, W \\rangle = c(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle \\langle X,W \\rangle - \\langle X,Z \\rangle \\langle Y,W \\rangle)$$\nSubstituting this into the Gauss equation yields:\n$$\\langle R(X,Y)Z, W \\rangle = c(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle \\langle X,W \\rangle - \\langle X,Z \\rangle \\langle Y,W \\rangle) + h(X,W)h(Y,Z) - h(X,Z)h(Y,W)$$\nLet's find the components $R_{ijkl} = \\langle R(e_i, e_j)e_k, e_l \\rangle$ of the Riemann tensor in our chosen orthonormal basis by setting $X=e_i$, $Y=e_j$, $Z=e_k$, and $W=e_l$.\n$$R_{ijkl} = c(\\langle e_j, e_k \\rangle \\langle e_i, e_l \\rangle - \\langle e_i, e_k \\rangle \\langle e_j, e_l \\rangle) + h(e_i,e_l)h(e_j,e_k) - h(e_i,e_k)h(e_j,e_l)$$\nUsing the orthonormality condition $\\langle e_a, e_b \\rangle = \\delta_{ab}$ and the component notation $h_{ab} = h(e_a, e_b)$, we get:\n$$R_{ijkl} = c(\\delta_{jk}\\delta_{il} - \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}) + h_{il}h_{jk} - h_{ik}h_{jl}$$\nThe problem asks for the intrinsic sectional curvature $K_{ij}$ of the $2$-plane spanned by $e_i$ and $e_j$. By definition, for an orthonormal pair of vectors, this is given by:\n$$K_{ij} = \\langle R(e_i, e_j)e_j, e_i \\rangle = R_{ijji}$$\nWe can find this by setting the indices $k=j$ and $l=i$ in the expression for $R_{ijkl}$. We assume $i \\neq j$, as sectional curvature is defined for a $2$-plane.\n$$K_{ij} = R_{ijji} = c(\\delta_{jj}\\delta_{ii} - \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{ji}) + h_{ii}h_{jj} - h_{ij}h_{ji}$$\nNow, we evaluate the terms:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\delta_{ii} = 1$ and $\\delta_{jj} = 1$.\n    \\item Since $i \\neq j$, we have $\\delta_{ij} = 0$ and $\\delta_{ji} = 0$.\n    \\item The curvature term from the ambient space is $c(1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 0) = c$.\n    \\item From our previous derivation, $h_{ab} = \\kappa_a \\delta_{ab}$. Thus:\n        \\begin{itemize}\n            \\item $h_{ii} = \\kappa_i \\delta_{ii} = \\kappa_i$.\n            \\item $h_{jj} = \\kappa_j \\delta_{jj} = \\kappa_j$.\n            \\item $h_{ij} = \\kappa_i \\delta_{ij} = 0$ (since $i \\neq j$).\n            \\item $h_{ji} = \\kappa_j \\delta_{ji} = 0$ (since $j \\neq i$).\n        \\end{itemize}\n    \\item The term from the second fundamental form is $h_{ii}h_{jj} - h_{ij}h_{ji} = (\\kappa_i)(\\kappa_j) - (0)(0) = \\kappa_i \\kappa_j$.\n\\end{itemize}\nCombining these results, we substitute them back into the expression for $K_{ij}$:\n$$K_{ij} = c + \\kappa_i \\kappa_j$$\nThis is the final expression for the sectional curvature of the plane spanned by the principal directions $e_i$ and $e_j$ in terms of the ambient space curvature $c$ and the corresponding principal curvatures $\\kappa_i$ and $\\kappa_j$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{c + \\kappa_{i}\\kappa_{j}}\n$$", "id": "3049736"}]}
