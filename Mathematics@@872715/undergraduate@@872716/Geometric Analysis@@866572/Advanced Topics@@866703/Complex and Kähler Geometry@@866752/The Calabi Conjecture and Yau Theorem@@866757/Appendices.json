Your final answer must be a single expression. No rounding is required and no physical units are involved.", "solution": "The analysis of this problem begins with a precise characterization of the geometric objects involved. The manifold is $M = \\mathbb{C}^{n}$ with standard complex coordinates $z_j = x_j + i y_j$ for $j = 1, \\dots, n$. The metric $g$ is the standard flat Hermitian metric induced by the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.\n\nLet us first express the metric tensor in these complex coordinates. The standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is given by $ds^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (dx_j^2 + dy_j^2)$. We have the relations $dz_j = dx_j + i dy_j$ and $d\\bar{z}_j = dx_j - i dy_j$. Inverting these, we find $dx_j = \\frac{1}{2}(dz_j + d\\bar{z}_j)$ and $dy_j = \\frac{1}{2i}(dz_j - d\\bar{z}_j)$. Substituting these into the expression for $ds^2$ yields:\n$$\nds^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(dz_j + d\\bar{z}_j)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2i}(dz_j - d\\bar{z}_j)\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nds^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ (dz_j^2 + 2 dz_j d\\bar{z}_j + d\\bar{z}_j^2) - (dz_j^2 - 2 dz_j d\\bar{z}_j + d\\bar{z}_j^2) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nds^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{4} [4 dz_j d\\bar{z}_j] = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dz_j d\\bar{z}_j\n$$\nThis is the expression for the metric $g$ in local complex coordinates. A Hermitian metric is locally written as $g = \\sum_{j,k} g_{j\\bar{k}} dz_j \\otimes d\\bar{z}_k$. By comparing with our result, we identify the components of the metric tensor as $g_{j\\bar{k}} = \\delta_{jk}$ (the Kronecker delta) and $g_{jk} = g_{\\bar{j}\\bar{k}} = 0$. The inverse metric tensor has components $g^{j\\bar{k}} = \\delta_{jk}$.\n\nThe problem states that $\\omega$ is the associated Kähler form. A metric is called Kähler if its associated $(1,1)$-form $\\omega$ is closed ($d\\omega = 0$). The form $\\omega$ is defined by:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} g_{j\\bar{k}} dz_j \\wedge d\\bar{z}_k\n$$\nSubstituting the components $g_{j\\bar{k}} = \\delta_{jk}$, we obtain the Kähler form for flat $\\mathbb{C}^n$:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dz_j \\wedge d\\bar{z}_j\n$$\nThis form is indeed closed, as $d\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} d(dz_j \\wedge d\\bar{z}_j) = 0$ because $d^2=0$ and the coefficients are constant.\n\nNext, we must compute the Ricci form, $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega)$, using the curvature of the Chern connection. The Chern connection is the unique connection on the holomorphic tangent bundle that is compatible with both the metric and the complex structure. Its connection 1-forms, which form a matrix $\\theta = (\\theta^j_k)$, are given by the formula $\\theta = g^{-1} \\partial g$. In components, this is:\n$$\n\\theta^j_k = \\sum_{l=1}^{n} g^{j\\bar{l}} \\partial g_{k\\bar{l}}\n$$\nwhere $\\partial$ is the Dolbeault operator, $\\partial = \\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_m} dz_m$. In our case, the metric components $g_{k\\bar{l}} = \\delta_{kl}$ are constant functions on $\\mathbb{C}^n$. Therefore, all their partial derivatives are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g_{k\\bar{l}}}{\\partial z_m} = \\frac{\\partial \\delta_{kl}}{\\partial z_m} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k,l,m.\n$$\nThis implies that $\\partial g_{k\\bar{l}} = 0$ for all $k,l$. Consequently, the connection 1-forms are all identically zero:\n$$\n\\theta^j_k = \\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\delta_{jl} \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } j,k.\n$$\nThis result signifies that the connection is flat.\n\nThe curvature of the connection is described by the matrix of curvature 2-forms, $\\Theta = (\\Theta^j_k)$, which is defined by the second Cartan structural equation:\n$$\n\\Theta = d\\theta + \\theta \\wedge \\theta\n$$\nIn component form, this is:\n$$\n\\Theta^j_k = d\\theta^j_k + \\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\theta^j_l \\wedge \\theta^l_k\n$$\nSince we have established that the connection forms are all zero, $\\theta^j_k = 0$, it immediately follows that the curvature forms are also all zero:\n$$\n\\Theta^j_k = d(0) + \\sum_{l=1}^{n} 0 \\wedge 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } j,k.\n$$\nThis confirms that the Riemann curvature tensor of the flat metric on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is zero.\n\nFinally, the Ricci form, $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega)$, is defined as the trace of the matrix of curvature 2-forms.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\Theta^j_j\n$$\nSince every component $\\Theta^j_k$ of the curvature matrix is zero, the diagonal components $\\Theta^j_j$ are also zero. Therefore, their sum is zero:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} 0 = 0\n$$\nThe Ricci form for the standard flat metric on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is the zero 2-form.

The calculation was performed in the chart $U_0$. To show it is global, we must show that the forms $\\omega_{FS}$ and $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{FS})$ are invariant under patching with other charts, e.g., $U_k = \\{ Z_k \\neq 0 \\}$. The Kähler potential in a chart $U_k$ is $\\Phi_k = \\ln(\\sum_{j=0}^n |Z_j|^2) - \\ln(|Z_k|^2)$. In the chart $U_0$, it was $\\Phi_0 = \\ln(\\sum_{j=0}^n |Z_j|^2) - \\ln(|Z_0|^2)$. On the overlap $U_0 \\cap U_k$, the difference is $\\Phi_k - \\Phi_0 = \\ln(|Z_0|^2) - \\ln(|Z_k|^2) = \\ln(|Z_0/Z_k|^2)$. In coordinates $z_j=Z_j/Z_0$, this is $-\\ln(|z_k|^2) = -\\ln(z_k) - \\ln(\\bar{z}_k)$. The difference is the sum of a holomorphic function and an anti-holomorphic function. When we apply the operator $\\partial\\bar{\\partial}$, this difference vanishes: $\\partial\\bar{\\partial}(\\ln(z_k)) = 0$ and $\\partial\\bar{\\partial}(\\ln(\\bar{z}_k))=0$. Therefore, $\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\Phi_k = \\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\Phi_0$ on the overlap. This shows that $\\omega_{FS}$ is a globally well-defined $(1,1)$-form on $\\mathbb{CP}^n$. Since the Ricci form is just a constant multiple of $\\omega_{FS}$, $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{FS})$ is also globally well-defined.\n\nFinally, we connect this result to the first Chern class of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$. For any Kähler manifold, the de Rham cohomology class of its first Chern class, $c_1(T\\mathbb{CP}^n)$, is represented by the 2-form $\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega)$, where $\\omega$ is any Kähler metric on the manifold. Using our result for the Fubini-Study metric:\n$$\nc_1(\\mathbb{CP}^n) = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{FS}) \\right] = \\left[ \\frac{n+1}{2\\pi}\\omega_{FS} \\right]\n$$\nThis result reflects a fundamental property of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$. The cohomology class of the normalized Fubini-Study form, $[\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\omega_{FS}]$, is the generator of $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^n, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and corresponds to the hyperplane class $H$. Thus, our calculation shows that $c_1(\\mathbb{CP}^n) = (n+1)H$. This agrees with the fact that the canonical bundle of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is $K_{\\mathbb{CP}^n} = \\mathcal{O}(-(n+1))$, and $c_1(T\\mathbb{CP}^n) = -c_1(K_{\\mathbb{CP}^n}) = (n+1) c_1(\\mathcal{O}(1)) = (n+1)H$. The fact that the Ricci form is a positive multiple of the metric form, $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{FS})=(n+1)\\omega_{FS}$ with $n+10$, means that the Fubini-Study metric is a Kähler-Einstein metric with positive scalar curvature. This is a key example in the theory of Calabi-Yau manifolds and Yau's theorem, as it provides an explicit solution to the Kähler-Einstein equation on $\\mathbb{CP}^n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{FS}) = (n+1)\\omega_{FS}}$$", "id": "3066672"}]}
