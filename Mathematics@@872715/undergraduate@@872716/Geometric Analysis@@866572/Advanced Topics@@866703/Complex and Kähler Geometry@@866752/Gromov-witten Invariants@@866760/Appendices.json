The second part is to use this result to derive the expected real dimension of the moduli space of genus $0$ stable maps to $\\mathbb{C}P^n$, denoted $\\mathcal{M}_{0,k}(\\mathbb{C}P^n, d)$.\n\nPart 1: Computation of $c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^n)$.\nWe are given the Euler sequence for the tangent bundle of complex projective space $\\mathbb{C}P^n$:\n$$0\\longrightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\longrightarrow \\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus (n+1)}\\longrightarrow T\\mathbb{C}P^{n}\\longrightarrow 0$$\nThis is a short exact sequence of complex vector bundles over $\\mathbb{C}P^n$, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the trivial complex line bundle and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is the hyperplane line bundle.\n\nThe first Chern class $c_1$ is additive over short exact sequences of vector bundles.

The philosophy is to count the number of complex parameters describing the maps and subtract the dimension of the symmetries.\n\nA point in the moduli space corresponds to a holomorphic map $f: \\mathbb{C}P^1 \\to \\mathbb{C}P^n$ with $k$ marked points on the domain $\\mathbb{C}P^1$, up to reparameterization of the domain.\nThe parameters are:\n1. The deformation parameters of the map $f$. The space of infinitesimal deformations is identified with the space of global sections of the pullback of the tangent bundle, $H^0(\\mathbb{C}P^1, f^*T\\mathbb{C}P^n)$. The obstruction space is $H^1(\\mathbb{C}P^1, f^*T\\mathbb{C}P^n)$. The expected complex dimension of the space of deformations is the index of the associated linearized Cauchy-Riemann operator, which is given by the Euler characteristic $\\chi(f^*T\\mathbb{C}P^n) = h^0(f^*T\\mathbb{C}P^n) - h^1(f^*T\\mathbb{C}P^n)$.\n2. The parameters for the positions of the $k$ marked points on the domain $\\mathbb{C}P^1$.

We are given that its complex dimension is $3$.\n\nThe expected complex dimension of $\\mathcal{M}_{0,k}(\\mathbb{C}P^n, d)$ is thus:\n$$\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{M}_{0,k}(\\mathbb{C}P^{n},d) = \\chi(f^*T\\mathbb{C}P^n) + k - \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbb{C}))$$\nWe use the provided Riemann-Roch theorem for a holomorphic vector bundle $E$ on $\\mathbb{C}P^1$, which states $\\chi(E) = \\mathrm{rank}(E) + \\deg(E)$.

We will solve this by following the three steps outlined in the problem.\n\nFirst, we compute the expected complex dimension of the moduli space $\\overline{M}_{0,2}(X, H)$ and verify the well-posedness of the integral definition of the invariant. The general formula for the expected complex dimension of the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{vdim}_{\\mathbb{C}} \\overline{M}_{g,n}(X, \\beta) = (1-g)(\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} X - 3) + n + \\int_{\\beta} c_1(TX)\n$$\nIn our specific case, the genus is $g=0$, the number of marked points is $n=2$, the target space is $X = \\mathbb{C}P^2$, and the curve homology class is $\\beta = H$, the hyperplane class.\n\nThe complex dimension of the target space is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} X = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} \\mathbb{C}P^2 = 2$.\nTo find the integral term $\\int_{H} c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2)$, we first need the first Chern class $c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2)$ of the tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{C}P^2$. The tangent bundle $T\\mathbb{C}P^2$ fits into the Euler exact sequence:\n$$\n0 \\to \\mathcal{O} \\to \\mathcal{O}(H)^{\\oplus 3} \\to T\\mathbb{C}P^2 \\to 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{O}$ is the trivial line bundle and $\\mathcal{O}(H)$ is the hyperplane line bundle whose first Chern class is $c_1(\\mathcal{O}(H)) = H$. Using the multiplicativity of the total Chern class $c$, we have $c(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = c(\\mathcal{O}(H)^{\\oplus 3}) / c(\\mathcal{O}) = (c(\\mathcal{O}(H)))^3$.\nSince $c(\\mathcal{O}(H)) = 1 + c_1(\\mathcal{O}(H)) = 1+H$, the total Chern class of $T\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is:\n$$\nc(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = (1+H)^3 = 1 + 3H + 3H^2 + H^3\n$$\nIn the cohomology ring $H^*(\\mathbb{C}P^2; \\mathbb{Z})$, the class $H^k = 0$ for $k > 2$ since $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathbb{C}P^2 = 2$. Thus, $H^3=0$ and $c(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = 1 + 3H + 3H^2$.\nThe first Chern class is the term of degree $2$, so $c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = 3H$.\nNow we can compute the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{H} c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = \\int_{H} 3H = 3 \\int_{\\mathbb{C}P^2} H \\smile H = 3 \\int_{\\mathbb{C}P^2} H^2\n$$\nThe intersection number $\\int_{\\mathbb{C}P^2} H^2$ is the self-intersection of a generic line in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$, which corresponds to the degree of the projective line, equal to $1$. More formally, in the Chow ring, $H^2$ is the class of a point, so the integral evaluates to $1$. Thus, $\\int_{H} c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = 3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n\nSubstituting all values into the dimension formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{vdim}_{\\mathbb{C}} \\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, H) = (1-0)(2 - 3) + 2 + 3 = -1 + 2 + 3 = 4\n$$\nThe expected complex dimension of the moduli space is $4$. The virtual fundamental class $[\\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, H)]^{\\mathrm{vir}}$ is therefore a homology class of real dimension $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nThe invariant is defined by the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{[\\overline{M}_{0,2}(X,H)]^{\\mathrm{vir}}} \\mathrm{ev}_1^{*}(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt})) \\smile \\mathrm{ev}_2^{*}(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt}))\n$$\nThe Poincaré dual of a point class in $X=\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is a cohomology class $\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt}) \\in H^{2 \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} X}(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = H^4(\\mathbb{C}P^2; \\mathbb{Z})$. The degree of this class is $4$.\nThe evaluation maps $\\mathrm{ev}_1, \\mathrm{ev}_2$ pull this class back to the moduli space. The pullback classes $\\mathrm{ev}_1^*(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt}))$ and $\\mathrm{ev}_2^*(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt}))$ are elements of $H^4(\\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, H); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe cup product of these two classes is the integrand:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ev}_1^{*}(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt})) \\smile \\mathrm{ev}_2^{*}(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt})) \\in H^{4+4}(\\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, H); \\mathbb{Z}) = H^8(\\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, H); \\mathbb{Z})\n$$\nThe integral pairs an $8$-dimensional homology class (the virtual fundamental class) with an $8$-th degree cohomology class (the integrand). The degrees match, so the result of the integration is a number, as expected.\n\nSecond, we argue that the invariant counts the number of degree-$1$ curves passing through two generic points. The Gromov-Witten invariant is constructed to provide a rigorous count of such curves. The constraints $\\mathrm{ev}_1^*(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt}))$ and $\\mathrm{ev}_2^*(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt}))$ impose the geometric conditions that the images of the two marked points, $\\mathrm{ev}_1(f)$ and $\\mathrm{ev}_2(f)$, must lie on the submanifolds Poincaré dual to $\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt})$. For a point class, this submanifold is simply a point. If we choose two generic points $p_1, p_2 \\in \\mathbb{C}P^2$, the constraints become $\\mathrm{ev}_1(f) = p_1$ and $\\mathrm{ev}_2(f) = p_2$. In this case, for generic points, transversality holds, and the virtual fundamental class can be identified with the ordinary fundamental class of the moduli space (which is a smooth manifold of the expected dimension in this simple case). The integral then counts the number of points in the moduli space satisfying these conditions. A point in $\\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, H)$ is a stable map $f: C \\to \\mathbb{C}P^2$ where $C$ is a genus-$0$ curve, the degree of the image is $1$ (a line), and there are two marked points on $C$. The conditions $\\mathrm{ev}_1(f) = p_1$ and $\\mathrm{ev}_2(f) = p_2$ mean that the image of the curve $f(C)$ must contain both points $p_1$ and $p_2$. Therefore, the invariant $\\langle \\mathrm{pt}, \\mathrm{pt} \\rangle_{0,H}$ counts the number of complex projective lines in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ that pass through two given generic points $p_1$ and $p_2$.\n\nThird, we determine this number using classical projective geometry. A point in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is represented by a 1-dimensional subspace in $\\mathbb{C}^3$. Two distinct generic points $p_1$ and $p_2$ in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ correspond to two distinct 1-dimensional subspaces in $\\mathbb{C}^3$, spanned by linearly independent vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in \\mathbb{C}^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. A complex projective line in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is the projectivization of a 2-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{C}^3$. A line passes through $p_1$ and $p_2$ if and only if the corresponding 2-dimensional subspace in $\\mathbb{C}^3$ contains the 1-dimensional subspaces spanned by $v_1$ and $v_2$. Since $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent, they span a unique 2-dimensional subspace, namely $\\mathrm{span}(v_1, v_2)$. The projectivization of this unique 2-dimensional subspace gives the unique complex projective line passing through $p_1$ and $p_2$.\n\nAlternatively, a line in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is defined by a linear equation $a_0 x_0 + a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 = 0$, where $[a_0: a_1: a_2]$ are the homogeneous coordinates of the line in the dual projective plane $(\\mathbb{C}P^2)^*$. Let $p_1 = [v_0: v_1: v_2]$ and $p_2 = [w_0: w_1: w_2]$. For a line to pass through both points, its coefficients must satisfy:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\na_0 v_0 + a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 = 0 \\\\\na_0 w_0 + a_1 w_1 + a_2 w_2 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is a system of two linear equations for the three unknowns $(a_0, a_1, a_2)$. Since $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distinct, the vectors $v = (v_0, v_1, v_2)$ and $w = (w_0, w_1, w_2)$ are linearly independent. The coefficient matrix of this system has rank $2$. The solution space for the vector $a=(a_0, a_1, a_2)$ is therefore 1-dimensional. A 1-dimensional vector space of coefficients corresponds to a single point in the dual projective plane $(\\mathbb{C}P^2)^*$, and thus to a single unique line in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$.\n\nBoth geometric arguments lead to the conclusion that there is exactly $1$ line passing through two generic points in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$.\nTherefore, the value of the Gromov-Witten invariant is $1$.\n\n$$\n\\langle \\mathrm{pt}, \\mathrm{pt} \\rangle_{0,H} = 1\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3050949"}, {"introduction": "Gromov-Witten theory is governed by a set of powerful axioms that unveil its rich algebraic structure and dramatically simplify computations.

The formula becomes:\n$$ \\mathrm{vdim}_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\overline{M}_{g,k}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1},d)) = (1-g)(1 - 3) + 2d + k = 2d - 2(1-g) + k $$\nThe invariant $\\langle \\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_k \\rangle_{g,\\beta}$ is a non-zero number only if the sum of the degrees of the cohomology classes equals the real dimension of the virtual fundamental class:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^k \\deg(\\alpha_i) = 2 \\cdot \\mathrm{vdim}_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\overline{M}_{g,k}(X,\\beta)) $$\nFor the invariant in question, $\\langle H, H \\rangle_{0,1}$, we have $g=0$, $k=2$, $d=1$, $\\alpha_1=H$, $\\alpha_2=H$. The degree of $H \\in H^2(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^1)$ is $2$.\n-   LHS: $\\deg(H) + \\deg(H) = 2+2=4$.\n-   RHS: $2 \\cdot \\mathrm{vdim}_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1},1)) = 2 \\cdot (2(1) - 2(1-0) + 2) = 2 \\cdot (2 - 2 + 2) = 4$.\nSince LHS = RHS, the invariant is well-defined. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nWe are asked to compute $\\langle H, H \\rangle_{0,1}$ for $X=\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}$, where $H$ is the class dual to a point. The computation must use the divisor axiom and the definition of Gromov-Witten invariants.\n\n**Step 1: Application of the Divisor Axiom**\n\nThe divisor axiom states:\n$$ \\langle \\mathrm{PD}[D],\\alpha_2,\\dots,\\alpha_k\\rangle_{g,\\beta} = (\\beta\\cdot [D])\\,\\langle \\alpha_2,\\dots,\\alpha_k\\rangle_{g,\\beta} $$\nIn our case, $\\alpha_1 = H = \\mathrm{PD}[D]$ and the remaining insertion is $\\alpha_2=H$. The curve class $\\beta$ is of degree $1$. The divisor $D$ is a point, so its homology class is $[D] = [\\text{pt}]$. The intersection number $(\\beta \\cdot [D])$ is the evaluation of the Poincaré dual class $\\mathrm{PD}[D]=H$ on the class $\\beta$:\n$$ \\beta \\cdot [D] = \\int_{\\beta} \\mathrm{PD}[D] = \\int_{[\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}]} H $$\nBy definition of a generator of $H^2(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^1)$, this integral is $1$. Thus, $(\\beta \\cdot [D]) = 1$.\n\nApplying the divisor axiom to our invariant $\\langle H, H \\rangle_{0,1}$:\n$$ \\langle H, H \\rangle_{0,1} = (1) \\cdot \\langle H \\rangle_{0,1} = \\langle H \\rangle_{0,1} $$\nThe problem of computing the $2$-point invariant is reduced to computing a $1$-point invariant.\n\n**Step 2: Computation of the 1-point Invariant from the Definition**\n\nNow we must compute $\\langle H \\rangle_{0,1}$ using its definition:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle_{0,1} = \\int_{[\\overline{M}_{0,1}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1},1)]^{\\mathrm{vir}}} \\mathrm{ev}_1^{*}(H) $$\nWe first check that this invariant is well-defined. For $g=0$, $k=1$, $d=1$, insertions $\\{H\\}$:\n-   LHS (sum of degrees): $\\deg(H)=2$.\n-   RHS (real vdim): $2 \\cdot \\mathrm{vdim}_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\overline{M}_{0,1}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1},1)) = 2 \\cdot (2(1) - 2(1-0) + 1) = 2 \\cdot (2 - 2 + 1) = 2$.\nThe invariant is well-defined.\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we must identify the moduli space $\\overline{M}_{0,1}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1},1)$ and the evaluation map $\\mathrm{ev}_1$.\nA point in $\\overline{M}_{0,1}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1},1)$ is an isomorphism class of stable maps $(f, C, p_1)$ where $C$ is a genus-$0$ curve, $p_1 \\in C$ is a marked point, and $f:C \\to \\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}$ is a degree-$1$ map.\n-   A degree-$1$ map from a genus-$0$ curve is necessarily from an irreducible domain, so $C \\cong \\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}$, and the map $f$ is an automorphism of $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}$, i.e., $f \\in \\mathrm{PGL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$.\n-   Two maps $(f, \\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}, p_1)$ and $(f', \\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}, p'_1)$ are isomorphic if there exists a $\\psi \\in \\mathrm{PGL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ such that $f' = f \\circ \\psi$ and $p'_1 = \\psi^{-1}(p_1)$.\n-   Let's fix a reference map, the identity $f'=\\mathrm{id}$. For any map $f \\in \\mathrm{PGL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$, we can choose $\\psi=f^{-1}$. Then $f' = f \\circ f^{-1} = \\mathrm{id}$. The marked point becomes $p'_1 = (f^{-1})^{-1}(p_1) = f(p_1)$. This means every stable map $(f, \\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^1, p_1)$ is isomorphic to one of the form $(\\mathrm{id}, \\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^1, q_1)$, where $q_1 = f(p_1)$.\n-   Since $f$ can be any automorphism and $p_1$ any point, the image point $q_1$ can be any point in $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}$.\n-   Therefore, the moduli space $\\overline{M}_{0,1}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1},1)$ is parameterized by the position of this image point $q_1$. This gives an isomorphism $\\overline{M}_{0,1}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1},1) \\cong \\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}$.\n-   For this space, the virtual dimension matches the actual complex dimension ($1$), so the virtual fundamental class is the standard fundamental class: $[\\overline{M}_{0,1}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1},1)]^{\\mathrm{vir}} = [\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}]$.\n\nThe evaluation map $\\mathrm{ev}_1: \\overline{M}_{0,1}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1},1) \\to \\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}$ sends a stable map to the image of its marked point. For the point in the moduli space represented by $(\\mathrm{id}, \\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^1, q_1)$, the image is $\\mathrm{id}(q_1) = q_1$. Under the isomorphism $\\overline{M}_{0,1}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1},1) \\cong \\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}$, the evaluation map is simply the identity map.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle_{0,1} = \\int_{[\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}]} \\mathrm{id}^{*}(H) = \\int_{\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{1}} H $$\nBy the definition of Poincaré duality and the choice of $H$ as the generator of $H^2(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^1)$, the integral of $H$ over the fundamental class of $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^1$ is $1$.\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle_{0,1} = 1 $$\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\nFrom Step 1, we found that $\\langle H, H \\rangle_{0,1} = \\langle H \\rangle_{0,1}$. From Step 2, we computed $\\langle H \\rangle_{0,1} = 1$. Therefore, the value of the requested invariant is $1$.\n$$ \\langle \\mathrm{PD}[D],\\mathrm{PD}[D]\\rangle_{0,\\beta} = 1 $$\nThis is an exact integer as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3050923"}]}
