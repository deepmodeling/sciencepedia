First, to derive the general coordinate expression for the Hessian of a smooth function $f$. Second, to compute this Hessian explicitly for a radial function $f(x)=F(r)$.\n\nThe Hessian of a smooth function $f$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is a symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor field, denoted $\\nabla^2 f$, defined as the covariant derivative of the gradient of $f$. The gradient of $f$ is a vector field, conventionally denoted $\\nabla f$, whose components in a local coordinate system are given by $(\\nabla f)^i = g^{ij}\\partial_j f$. However, it is more direct to consider the differential of $f$, $df$, which is a covector field (a $(0,1)$-tensor) with components $(df)_j = \\partial_j f$. The Hessian is then defined as the covariant derivative of $df$, such that $(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = (\\nabla(df))_{ij}$.\n\nThe components of the covariant derivative of a covector field $\\omega$ with components $\\omega_j$ are given by the formula:\n$$(\\nabla_i \\omega)_j = \\partial_i \\omega_j - \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\omega_k$$\nwhere $\\partial_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ and $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the second kind associated with the Levi-Civita connection of the metric $g$.\n\nTo find the components of the Hessian, we substitute $\\omega_j = (df)_j = \\partial_j f$ into the formula:\n$$(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\nabla_i (\\partial_j f) = \\partial_i(\\partial_j f) - \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\partial_k f$$\nThis expression is more commonly written as:\n$$(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^i \\partial x^j} - \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^k}$$\nThis is the general coordinate expression for the components of the Hessian of a function $f$. It is a standard result that for the torsion-free Levi-Civita connection, the Hessian is symmetric, i.e., $(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = (\\nabla^2 f)_{ji}$.\n\nNow, we specialize this result to the manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^{n},\\delta)$, where $\\delta$ is the Euclidean metric. In standard Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, the components of the metric tensor are given by the Kronecker delta, $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, which are constants. The Christoffel symbols are calculated from the derivatives of the metric components:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right)$$\nSince all components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ are constant, all their partial derivatives are zero. Consequently, all Christoffel symbols are zero: $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all $i, j, k$.\n\nSubstituting $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ into the general expression for the Hessian, we find that for the Euclidean metric in Cartesian coordinates, the Hessian components simplify to the ordinary second partial derivatives of the function:\n$$(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}$$\n\nThe final part of the problem requires computing these components for a radial function $f(x)=F(r)$, where $r = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + \\dots + x_n^2}$. We proceed by applying the chain rule.\n\nFirst, we compute the first partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x_i$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{dF}{dr} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x_i}$$\nWe need the partial derivative of $r$.
