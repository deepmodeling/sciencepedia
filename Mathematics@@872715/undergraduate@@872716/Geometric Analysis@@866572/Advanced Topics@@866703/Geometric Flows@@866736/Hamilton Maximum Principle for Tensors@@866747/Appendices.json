The evolution of $T$ is governed by the parabolic partial differential equation $\\partial_{t} T = \\Delta T + \\mathcal{N}(T)$, where $\\Delta$ is the rough Laplacian and $\\mathcal{N}(T)$ is a tensorial nonlinearity.

The definition of $R^{\\#}$ states:\n$$\\langle R^{\\#}X, Y \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{tr}\\!\\left( \\operatorname{ad}_{X} \\circ R \\circ \\operatorname{ad}_{Y} \\circ R \\right)$$\nTo compute this, we first establish the matrix representations of the operators $R$ and $\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{i}}$ with respect to the basis $\\{ e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3} \\}$.\nThe matrix representation of $R$, denoted $[R]$, is diagonal:\n$$[R] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\mu_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\mu_{3} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe matrices for the adjoint operators $\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{i}}$ are derived from the Lie bracket relations $[e_{i}, e_{j}] = \\varepsilon_{ijk} e_{k}$.\nFor $\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}$:\n$\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}(e_{1}) = [e_{1}, e_{1}] = 0$\n$\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}(e_{2}) = [e_{1}, e_{2}] = e_{3}$\n$\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}(e_{3}) = [e_{1}, e_{3}] = -e_{2}$\nThe matrix $[\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}]$ is therefore:\n$$[\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nBy cyclic permutation of indices $(1, 2, 3)$, we obtain the matrices for $\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{2}}$ and $\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{3}}$:\n$$[\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{2}}] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad [\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{3}}] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow, let's compute the first diagonal entry of $R^{\\#}$, which is $\\langle R^{\\#}e_{1}, e_{1} \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle R^{\\#}e_{1}, e_{1} \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{tr}\\!\\left( \\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}} \\circ R \\circ \\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}} \\circ R \\right)$$\nIn terms of matrix representations, this is $-\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{tr}( [\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}] [R] [\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}] [R] )$. Let's compute the matrix product:\n$$[\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}] [R] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\mu_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\mu_{3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\mu_{3} \\\\ 0 & \\mu_{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$([\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}] [R]) [\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\mu_{3} \\\\ 0 & \\mu_{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\mu_{3} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\mu_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$([\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}] [R] [\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}]) [R] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\mu_{3} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\mu_{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\mu_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\mu_{3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\mu_{3}\\mu_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\mu_{2}\\mu_{3} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe trace of this matrix is $\\operatorname{tr}(...) = 0 - \\mu_{2}\\mu_{3} - \\mu_{2}\\mu_{3} = -2\\mu_{2}\\mu_{3}$.\nThus, the first diagonal entry of $R^{\\#}$ is:\n$$\\langle R^{\\#}e_{1}, e_{1} \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2} (-2\\mu_{2}\\mu_{3}) = \\mu_{2}\\mu_{3}$$\nDue to the symmetric structure of the Lie algebra and the diagonal form of $R$, the other diagonal entries of $R^{\\#}$ can be found by cyclic permutation of the indices $(1, 2, 3)$:\n$$\\langle R^{\\#}e_{2}, e_{2} \\rangle = \\mu_{3}\\mu_{1}$$\n$$\\langle R^{\\#}e_{3}, e_{3} \\rangle = \\mu_{1}\\mu_{2}$$\nWe can also verify that the off-diagonal terms are zero. For instance, for $\\langle R^{\\#}e_{1}, e_{2} \\rangle$, the trace involves the matrix product $[\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}] [R] [\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{2}}] [R]$.\n$$[\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}] [R] [\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{2}}] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\mu_{3} \\\\ 0 & \\mu_{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\mu_{3} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$([\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{1}}] [R] [\\operatorname{ad}_{e_{2}}]) [R] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\mu_{3} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\mu_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\mu_{3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\mu_{3}\\mu_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe trace is $0$, so $\\langle R^{\\#}e_{1}, e_{2} \\rangle = 0$. By symmetry, all off-diagonal entries are zero, confirming that $R^{\\#}$ is also diagonal in this basis.\n\nThe diagonal entries of $R^{\\#}$ are $(\\mu_{2}\\mu_{3}, \\mu_{3}\\mu_{1}, \\mu_{1}\\mu_{2})$.\n\nFinally, we find the diagonal entries of $Q(R) = R^{2} + R^{\\#}$. Since both $R^{2}$ and $R^{\\#}$ are diagonal operators in the basis $\\{e_i\\}$, their sum $Q(R)$ is also diagonal. The diagonal entries of $Q(R)$ are the sums of the corresponding diagonal entries of $R^{2}$ and $R^{\\#}$.\nLet the diagonal entries of $Q(R)$ be $(Q_{1}, Q_{2}, Q_{3})$.\n$$Q_{1} = (\\text{diag } R^{2})_{1} + (\\text{diag } R^{\\#})_{1} = \\mu_{1}^{2} + \\mu_{2}\\mu_{3}$$\n$$Q_{2} = (\\text{diag } R^{2})_{2} + (\\text{diag } R^{\\#})_{2} = \\mu_{2}^{2} + \\mu_{3}\\mu_{1}$$\n$$Q_{3} = (\\text{diag } R^{2})_{3} + (\\text{diag } R^{\\#})_{3} = \\mu_{3}^{2} + \\mu_{1}\\mu_{2}$$\nThe ordered triple of diagonal entries is $(\\mu_{1}^{2} + \\mu_{2}\\mu_{3}, \\mu_{2}^{2} + \\mu_{1}\\mu_{3}, \\mu_{3}^{2} + \\mu_{1}\\mu_{2})$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_{1}^{2} + \\mu_{2}\\mu_{3} & \\mu_{2}^{2} + \\mu_{1}\\mu_{3} & \\mu_{3}^{2} + \\mu_{1}\\mu_{2} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3051318"}]}
