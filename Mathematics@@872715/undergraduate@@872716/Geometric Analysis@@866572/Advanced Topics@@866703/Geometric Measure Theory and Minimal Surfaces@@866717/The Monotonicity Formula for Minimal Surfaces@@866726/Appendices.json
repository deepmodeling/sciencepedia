It is set within the standard framework of geometric measure theory. An affine plane is a precise mathematical object, as are the Hausdorff measure and Euclidean balls. The density ratio is a standard definition used, for example, in the study of minimal surfaces and rectifiable sets. There are no scientific or factual contradictions, no ambiguities in terminology, and no missing information. The problem is a foundational calculation in its field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the expression for the density ratio:\n$$\n\\theta_{M}(x_{0},r) = \\frac{\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(M \\cap B_{r}(x_{0})\\right)}{\\omega_{m}\\, r^{m}}\n$$\nWe must first analyze the numerator, $\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(M \\cap B_{r}(x_{0})\\right)$. This term represents the $m$-dimensional measure of the intersection of the affine plane $M$ and the open ball $B_{r}(x_{0})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nBy definition, $M$ is an $m$-dimensional affine plane. Since it contains the point $x_0$, it can be represented as the translation of an $m$-dimensional linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $V$ be this $m$-dimensional vector subspace. Then, $M = x_0 + V = \\{x_0 + v : v \\in V\\}$.\n\nThe intersection $M \\cap B_{r}(x_{0})$ is the set of points $y \\in M$ such that $|y - x_0|  r$. Since any $y \\in M$ can be written as $y = x_0 + v$ for a unique $v \\in V$, the condition becomes:\n$$\n|(x_{0} + v) - x_{0}|  r\n$$\nwhich simplifies to:\n$$\n|v|  r\n$$\nThis means that the intersection $M \\cap B_{r}(x_{0})$ corresponds to the set of points $\\{x_0 + v : v \\in V, |v|  r\\}$. Let's call the set of vectors $\\{v \\in V : |v|  r\\}$ as $B_r^V(0)$. This is an $m$-dimensional open ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin within the subspace $V$. Thus, the intersection is $x_0 + B_r^V(0)$.\n\nNow, we use the fundamental properties of the $m$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\\mathcal{H}^{m}$.\n1.  **Invariance under Euclidean Isometries**: $\\mathcal{H}^m$ is invariant under translations and rotations.\n    -   Using invariance under the translation by $-x_0$, we have:\n        $$\n        \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(M \\cap B_{r}(x_{0})\\right) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(x_0 + B_r^V(0)\\right) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(B_r^V(0)\\right)\n        $$\n    -   The $m$-dimensional linear subspace $V$ is isometrically isomorphic to the standard Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^m$. Let $T: V \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ be a linear isometry. Such a map preserves norms, so it maps the ball $B_r^V(0)$ in $V$ to the standard $m$-dimensional ball $B_r^m(0) = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^m : |z|  r\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. The Hausdorff measure is invariant under this isometry $T$:\n        $$\n        \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(B_r^V(0)\\right) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(T(B_r^V(0))\\right) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(B_r^m(0)\\right)\n        $$\n    Combining these steps, the numerator becomes $\\mathcal{H}^{m}(B_r^m(0))$.\n\n2.  **Homogeneity under Dilations**: For any measurable set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^m$ and any scaling factor $\\lambda  0$, the Hausdorff measure obeys the scaling law $\\mathcal{H}^m(\\lambda A) = \\lambda^m \\mathcal{H}^m(A)$.\n    The ball $B_r^m(0)$ can be expressed as a dilation of the unit ball $B_1^m(0)$ by a factor of $r$. That is, $B_r^m(0) = r \\cdot B_1^m(0)$. Applying the scaling property with $\\lambda=r$:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(B_r^m(0)\\right) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(r \\cdot B_1^m(0)\\right) = r^m \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(B_1^m(0)\\right)\n    $$\n\nBy definition given in the problem, $\\omega_m = \\mathcal{H}^{m}(B_1^m(0))$, which is the volume of the unit $m$-ball.\nSubstituting this into our expression for the numerator, we get:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(M \\cap B_{r}(x_{0})\\right) = r^m \\omega_m\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the density ratio $\\theta_{M}(x_{0},r)$ by substituting this result back into the original formula:\n$$\n\\theta_{M}(x_{0},r) = \\frac{r^m \\omega_m}{\\omega_m r^m}\n$$\nProvided that $r  0$ and $\\omega_m  0$ (which is true for any integer $m \\ge 1$), the terms $\\omega_m$ and $r^m$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out.\n$$\n\\theta_{M}(x_{0},r) = 1\n$$\nThe result is the constant value $1$. This result is independent of the radius $r$ (for $r  0$) and the choice of point $x_0$ (as long as $x_0 \\in M$).

The Euclidean metric $ds_{Euc}^2$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ takes the form of a warped product in these coordinates:\n$$\nds_{Euc}^2 = ds^2 + s^2 g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}\n$$\nwhere $g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$ is the standard round metric on the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$.\n\nThe cone $C(\\Sigma) \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is parameterized by points $(s, \\theta)$ where $s \\in (0, \\infty)$ and $\\theta \\in \\Sigma$.

A set $K$ is a cone if for any point $p \\in K$ and any scalar $t \\ge 0$, the point $t p$ is also in $K$. Our set $C$ satisfies this property: if $(x,y) \\in C$, then $|x|=|y|$.

Thus, $C$ is a cone.\n\nTo compute the measure $\\mathcal{H}^{7}(C \\cap B_r(0))$, we utilize the structure of the cone. The measure of the portion of a $k$-dimensional cone $K$ inside a ball of radius $r$ can be related to the measure of its intersection with the unit sphere, known as the link of the cone. Let $f: K \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be the function $f(p) = |p|$. This function is Lipschitz. The coarea formula applied to $f$ on the manifold $K \\cap B_r(0)$ states:\n$$\n\\int_{K \\cap B_r(0)} |\\nabla_K f| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^k = \\int_0^r \\mathcal{H}^{k-1}(K \\cap S_t^{n-1}) \\, dt\n$$\nwhere $S_t^{n-1}$ is the sphere of radius $t$ centered at the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and $\\nabla_K f$ is the tangential gradient of $f$ on $K$.

We first compute the $3$-dimensional measure of a single sphere $S^3(R)$ of radius $R$. The surface area (or $(m-1)$-dimensional measure) of an $(m-1)$-sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\text{Area}(S^{m-1}) = \\frac{2\\pi^{m/2}}{\\Gamma(m/2)}\n$$\nFor a $3$-sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, we have $m=4$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^3(S^3) = \\frac{2\\pi^{4/2}}{\\Gamma(4/2)} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{\\Gamma(2)} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{1!} = 2\\pi^2\n$$\nThe measure of a sphere scales with its radius $R$ as $R^{m-1}$. Thus, for $S^3(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})$ with $R = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and dimension $m-1=3$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^3\\left(S^3\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^3 \\mathcal{H}^3(S^3) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} (2\\pi^2) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe measure of the product manifold $\\Sigma$ is the product of the measures of its factors:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^6(\\Sigma) = \\mathcal{H}^3\\left(S^3\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right) \\times \\mathcal{H}^3\\left(S^3\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi^4}{2}\n$$\n\nStep 3: Compute the volume of the unit $7$-ball, $\\omega_7$.\nThe volume of the unit $n$-ball, $\\omega_n$, is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\omega_n = \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}\n$$\nFor $n=7$, we have:\n$$\n\\omega_7 = \\frac{\\pi^{7/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{7}{2}+1)} = \\frac{\\pi^{7/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{9}{2})}\n$$\nWe compute the Gamma function value using the property $\\Gamma(z+1) = z\\Gamma(z)$ and $\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\sqrt{\\pi}$:\n$$\n\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{105}{16}\\sqrt{\\pi}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\omega_7$:\n$$\n\\omega_7 = \\frac{\\pi^{7/2}}{\\frac{105}{16}\\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\frac{16\\pi^3}{105}\n$$\n\nStep 4: Compute the final density $\\Theta_C(0,r)$.\nWe now substitute the values of $\\mathcal{H}^6(\\Sigma)$ and $\\omega_7$ into our expression for the density:\n$$\n\\Theta_{C}(0,r) = \\frac{\\mathcal{H}^{6}(\\Sigma)}{7 \\omega_{7}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi^4}{2}}{7 \\cdot \\frac{16\\pi^3}{105}}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\n\\Theta_{C}(0,r) = \\frac{\\pi^4}{2} \\cdot \\frac{105}{7 \\cdot 16\\pi^3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cdot \\frac{105}{112}\n$$\nWe simplify the fraction $\\frac{105}{112}$ by noting that $105 = 7 \\cdot 15$ and $112 = 7 \\cdot 16$:\n$$\n\\frac{105}{112} = \\frac{15}{16}\n$$\nFinally, we obtain the exact value for the density:\n$$\n\\Theta_{C}(0,r) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cdot \\frac{15}{16} = \\frac{15\\pi}{32}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the density, which is a constant independent of $r$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{15\\pi}{32}}$$", "id": "3036221"}]}
