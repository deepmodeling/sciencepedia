The function $H(x)$, the interval $[-1,1]$, and the definition of total variation are all standard concepts in real analysis. The problem is a direct application of a core definition to a fundamental example function. It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains no ambiguities, contradictions, or missing information. The calculation is straightforward and leads to a unique, meaningful solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nTo compute the total variation $V_{-1}^{1}(H)$, we will use the given definition. Let $P = \\{x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$ be an arbitrary partition of the interval $[-1, 1]$, such that $-1 = x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_n = 1$. The sum for this partition is given by\n$$ S(P) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |H(x_i) - H(x_{i-1})| $$\nThe function $H(x)$ is defined as\n$$ H(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } x \\in [-1, 0] \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } x \\in (0, 1] \\end{cases} $$\nThe values of $H(x)$ are restricted to the set $\\{0, 1\\}$. Therefore, for any two points $x_{i-1}$ and $x_i$ in the partition, the term $|H(x_i) - H(x_{i-1})|$ can only take one of the following values: $|0-0|=0$, $|1-1|=0$, $|1-0|=1$, or $|0-1|=1$. A term in the sum is non-zero if and only if its value is $1$, which occurs when $H(x_i) \\neq H(x_{i-1})$.\n\nThis inequality $H(x_i) \\neq H(x_{i-1})$ holds if and only if one of the points $x_{i-1}, x_i$ lies in the interval $[-1, 0]$ and the other lies in $(0, 1]$. Since the partition points are ordered ($x_{i-1} < x_i$), this condition is met precisely when $x_{i-1} \\le 0 < x_i$.\n\nFor any partition $P$ of $[-1, 1]$, we will now show that there exists exactly one index $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ for which the condition $x_{k-1} \\le 0 < x_k$ is satisfied.\nSince $x_0 = -1 \\le 0$ and $x_n = 1 > 0$, the set of indices $j$ such that $x_j > 0$ is non-empty. Let $k$ be the smallest index in this set. Then $x_k > 0$. By the minimality of $k$, the previous point in the partition, $x_{k-1}$, must satisfy $x_{k-1} \\le 0$. Thus, for this index $k$, we have $x_{k-1} \\le 0 < x_k$. This proves the existence of such an index.\nTo prove uniqueness, assume there is another index $j$ such that $x_{j-1} \\le 0 < x_j$.\nIf $j < k$, this contradicts the choice of $k$ as the minimal index for which $x_k > 0$.\nIf $j > k$, then $j-1 \\ge k$. From the ordering of the partition, this implies $x_{j-1} \\ge x_k$. Since $x_k > 0$, we have $x_{j-1} > 0$. This contradicts the assumption that $x_{j-1} \\le 0$.\nTherefore, the index $k$ is unique for any given partition $P$.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the sum $S(P)$ for an arbitrary partition $P$.\nThe sum consists of terms $|H(x_i) - H(x_{i-1})|$.\n- For all indices $i < k$, we have $x_i \\le x_{k-1} \\le 0$. Thus, both $x_{i-1}$ and $x_i$ are in $[-1, 0]$. This means $H(x_{i-1}) = 0$ and $H(x_i) = 0$. The corresponding term in the sum is $|0-0| = 0$.\n- For the index $i=k$, we have $x_{k-1} \\le 0$ and $x_k > 0$. This implies $H(x_{k-1}) = 0$ and $H(x_k) = 1$. The term is $|H(x_k) - H(x_{k-1})| = |1 - 0| = 1$.\n- For all indices $i > k$, we have $x_{i-1} \\ge x_k > 0$. Thus, both $x_{i-1}$ and $x_i$ are in $(0, 1]$. This means $H(x_{i-1}) = 1$ and $H(x_i) = 1$. The corresponding term is $|1-1| = 0$.\n\nSo, for any partition $P$ of $[-1, 1]$, the sum is\n$$ S(P) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |H(x_i) - H(x_{i-1})| = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} 0\\right) + 1 + \\left(\\sum_{i=k+1}^{n} 0\\right) = 1. $$\nThis shows that the sum of variations is exactly $1$ for *every* possible partition of the interval. The set of values of these sums is therefore the singleton set $\\{1\\}$.\n\nThe total variation $V_{-1}^{1}(H)$ is the supremum of this set of sums.\n$$ V_{-1}^{1}(H) = \\sup \\{ S(P) : P \\text{ is a partition of } [-1, 1] \\} = \\sup\\{1\\} = 1. $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3049112"}, {"introduction": "While the classical definition is intuitive, the modern theory of bounded variation is built upon the more powerful framework of distributional derivatives.

Computation of the Distributional Derivative $Du$**\n\nThe distributional derivative $Du$ of a function $u \\in L_{loc}^{1}(\\Omega)$ is a distribution defined by its action on a test function $\\phi \\in C_c^{\\infty}(\\Omega)$ (the space of infinitely differentiable functions with compact support in $\\Omega$). The action is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\langle Du, \\phi \\rangle = - \\langle u, \\phi' \\rangle = - \\int_{\\Omega} u(x) \\phi'(x) \\, dx\n$$\nSubstituting our specific function $u(x) = \\chi_{(0,1)}(x)$:\n$$\n\\langle Du, \\phi \\rangle = - \\int_{-2}^{2} \\chi_{(0,1)}(x) \\phi'(x) \\, dx = - \\int_{0}^{1} \\phi'(x) \\, dx\n$$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate this integral:\n$$\n- \\int_{0}^{1} \\phi'(x) \\, dx = -[\\phi(x)]_{0}^{1} = -(\\phi(1) - \\phi(0)) = \\phi(0) - \\phi(1)\n$$\nThe Dirac delta measure centered at a point $a$, denoted $\\delta_a$, is defined by its action on a test function as $\\langle \\delta_a, \\phi \\rangle = \\phi(a)$. Using this definition, we can express the action of $Du$ as:\n$$\n\\langle Du, \\phi \\rangle = \\phi(0) - \\phi(1) = \\langle \\delta_0, \\phi \\rangle - \\langle \\delta_1, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle \\delta_0 - \\delta_1, \\phi \\rangle\n$$\nSince this equality holds for all $\\phi \\in C_c^{\\infty}(\\Omega)$, we can identify the distributional derivative $Du$ with the signed measure $\\delta_0 - \\delta_1$.\n$$\nDu = \\delta_0 - \\delta_1\n$$\n\n**3. Justification that $u \\in BV(\\Omega)$**\n\nAccording to the definition, a function $u \\in L^{1}(\\Omega)$ is of bounded variation if $Du$ is a finite Radon measure on $\\Omega$. A measure $\\mu$ is finite on $\\Omega$ if its total variation $|\\mu|(\\Omega)$ is finite. The points $0$ and $1$ are both within the domain $\\Omega=(-2,2)$.\n\nThe measure $Du = \\delta_0 - \\delta_1$ is a signed Radon measure. Its total variation measure is $|Du| = |\\delta_0 - \\delta_1| = \\delta_0 + \\delta_1$. The total variation of this measure on $\\Omega$ is:\n$$\n|Du|(\\Omega) = \\int_{\\Omega} d|Du| = \\int_{-2}^{2} d(\\delta_0 + \\delta_1) = (\\delta_0 + \\delta_1)((-2,2))\n$$\nSince the support of $\\delta_0$ is $\\{0\\}$ and the support of $\\delta_1$ is $\\{1\\}$, and both $\\{0\\} \\subset \\Omega$ and $\\{1\\} \\subset \\Omega$, we have:\n$$\n|Du|(\\Omega) = \\delta_0(\\Omega) + \\delta_1(\\Omega) = 1 + 1 = 2\n$$\nSince the total variation $|Du|(\\Omega) = 2$ is finite, $Du$ is a finite Radon measure on $\\Omega$.\nWe have shown that $u \\in L^1(\\Omega)$ and its distributional derivative $Du$ is a finite Radon measure. Therefore, by definition, $u \\in BV(\\Omega)$.\n\n**4. Justification that $u \\notin W^{1,1}(\\Omega)$**\n\nA function $u$ is in the Sobolev space $W^{1,1}(\\Omega)$ if both $u \\in L^1(\\Omega)$ and its weak derivative (which is the distributional derivative $Du$) can be represented by a function in $L^1(\\Omega)$. That is, there must exist a function $g \\in L^1(\\Omega)$ such that $Du=g$. This means that for all test functions $\\phi \\in C_c^{\\infty}(\\Omega)$:\n$$\n\\langle Du, \\phi \\rangle = \\int_{\\Omega} g(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx\n$$\nFrom our calculation, we know $\\langle Du, \\phi \\rangle = \\phi(0) - \\phi(1)$. Thus, for $u$ to be in $W^{1,1}(\\Omega)$, there must exist a function $g \\in L^1(\\Omega)$ such that:\n$$\n\\int_{-2}^{2} g(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx = \\phi(0) - \\phi(1) \\quad \\forall \\phi \\in C_c^{\\infty}(\\Omega)\n$$\nThis is not possible. The Radon-Nikodym theorem states that a measure $\\mu$ can be represented by an $L^1$ function with respect to the Lebesgue measure $\\mathcal{L}^1$ if and only if $\\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\\mathcal{L}^1$. A measure $\\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\\mathcal{L}^1$ if for every set $E$ with $\\mathcal{L}^1(E)=0$, it holds that $\\mu(E)=0$.\n\nLet us check this condition for our measure $Du = \\delta_0 - \\delta_1$. Consider the set $E = \\{0, 1\\}$. The Lebesgue measure of this two-point set is $\\mathcal{L}^1(E) = 0$. However, the measure $Du$ of this set is:\n$$\nDu(E) = (\\delta_0 - \\delta_1)(\\{0, 1\\}) = \\delta_0(\\{0, 1\\}) - \\delta_1(\\{0, 1\\}) = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\nThe total variation measure $|Du|$, however, gives:\n$$\n|Du|(E) = (\\delta_0 + \\delta_1)(\\{0, 1\\}) = \\delta_0(\\{0, 1\\}) + \\delta_1(\\{0, 1\\}) = 1 + 1 = 2\n$$\nThe condition for absolute continuity must hold for the total variation measure. Since $\\mathcal{L}^1(E)=0$ but $|Du|(E)=2 \\neq 0$, the measure $Du$ is not absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.\nTherefore, by the Radon-Nikodym theorem, there is no function $g \\in L^1(\\Omega)$ that can represent the distribution $Du$. The derivative $Du$ is a purely singular measure.\nSince $Du$ is not in $L^1(\\Omega)$, the function $u$ is not in $W^{1,1}(\\Omega)$.\n\nThe explicit measure expression for $Du$ has been computed as $Du = \\delta_0 - \\delta_1$.

The closure of $D^-$ is $\\bar{D}^- = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid (x+2)^2 + y^2 \\le 1\\}$. The closure of $D^+$ is $\\bar{D}^+ = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid (x-2)^2 + y^2 \\le 1\\}$. The closure of the rectangle $R_k$ is $\\bar{R}_k = [-1,1] \\times [-\\varepsilon_k/2, \\varepsilon_k/2]$.\nThe intersections of these closed sets are:\n$\\bar{D}^- \\cap \\bar{D}^+ = \\emptyset$.\n$\\bar{D}^- \\cap \\bar{R}_k = \\emptyset$.\n$\\bar{D}^+ \\cap \\bar{R}_k = \\emptyset$.\nSince the open sets $D^-$, $R_k$, and $D^+$ are mutually disjoint, the characteristic function of their union is the sum of their characteristic functions: $\\chi_{E_k} = \\chi_{D^-} + \\chi_{R_k} + \\chi_{D^+}$. Similarly, $\\chi_E = \\chi_{D^-} + \\chi_{D^+}$.\n\n**A. $\\chi_{E_k} \\to \\chi_E$ in $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^2)$ as $k \\to \\infty$.**\n\nTo verify convergence in $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^2)$, we must show that $\\|\\chi_{E_k} - \\chi_E\\|_{L^1(\\mathbb{R}^2)} \\to 0$ as $k \\to \\infty$.\n$\\|\\chi_{E_k} - \\chi_E\\|_{L^1(\\mathbb{R}^2)} = \\mathcal{L}^2(E_k \\Delta E)$.\nThe symmetric difference $E_k \\Delta E$ is $(E_k \\setminus E) \\cup (E \\setminus E_k)$.\nSince $E = D^- \\cup D^+$ and $E_k = D^- \\cup R_k \\cup D^+$, it is clear that $E \\subset E_k$.\nTherefore, $E \\setminus E_k = \\emptyset$.\nThe set $E_k \\setminus E = (D^- \\cup R_k \\cup D^+) \\setminus (D^- \\cup D^+) = R_k \\setminus (D^- \\cup D^+)$.\nThe open sets $D^-$, $D^+$, and $R_k$ are disjoint. Thus, $R_k \\setminus (D^- \\cup D^+) = R_k$.\nSo, $E_k \\Delta E = R_k$.\nWe compute the Lebesgue measure of $R_k$:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}^2(R_k) = \\text{width} \\times \\text{height} = (1 - (-1)) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_k}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_k}{2}\\right)\\right) = 2 \\cdot \\varepsilon_k = \\frac{2}{k}. $$\nThe limit as $k \\to \\infty$ is:\n$$ \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\mathcal{L}^2(E_k \\Delta E) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\frac{2}{k} = 0. $$\nThis confirms that $\\chi_{E_k} \\to \\chi_E$ in $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^2)$.\n\nVerdict for A: **Correct**.\n\n**B. There exists $C>0$ such that $P(E_k) \\le C$ for all $k$.**\n\nThe perimeter $P(F)$ is the total variation of $\\chi_F$. For a set $F$ with a piecewise $C^1$ boundary (a Lipschitz set), $P(F) = \\mathcal{H}^{1}(\\partial F)$. The sets $E_k$ and $E$ are of this type.\nSince the sets $D^-$, $R_k$, and $D^+$ are disjoint and separated, the perimeter of their union is the sum of their individual perimeters.\n$P(E_k) = P(D^-) + P(R_k) + P(D^+)$.\n*   $P(D^-)$, the perimeter of a disk of radius $1$, is $2\\pi(1) = 2\\pi$.\n*   $P(D^+)$, the perimeter of a disk of radius $1$, is $2\\pi(1) = 2\\pi$.\n*   $P(R_k)$, the perimeter of the rectangle $R_k$, is $2 \\times (\\text{width}) + 2 \\times (\\text{height}) = 2(2) + 2(\\varepsilon_k) = 4 + 2\\varepsilon_k = 4 + \\frac{2}{k}$.\nSumming these gives the perimeter of $E_k$:\n$$ P(E_k) = 2\\pi + 2\\pi + 4 + \\frac{2}{k} = 4\\pi + 4 + \\frac{2}{k}. $$\nFor any $k \\ge 1$, we have $0 < \\frac{2}{k} \\le 2$.

The set $E = D^- \\cup D^+$ is a union of two disjoint open disks. Their boundaries are disjoint. Thus, perimeter is additive:\n$$ P(E) = P(D^-) + P(D^+) = 2\\pi + 2\\pi = 4\\pi. $$\nComparing the two results:\n$$ \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} P(E_k) = 4\\pi + 4 \\neq 4\\pi = P(E). $$\n\nVerdict for C: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Lower semicontinuity of perimeter fails in this example, i.e., $P(E) > \\liminf_{k\\to\\infty} P(E_k)$.**\n\nA fundamental property of sets of finite perimeter is the lower semicontinuity of the perimeter with respect to $L^1$ convergence. It states that if $\\chi_{F_k} \\to \\chi_F$ in $L^1$, then $P(F) \\le \\liminf_{k\\to\\infty} P(F_k)$.\nFrom A, we know that $\\chi_{E_k} \\to \\chi_E$ in $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^2)$. So the theorem applies. Let's check the inequality with our computed values:\n$P(E) = 4\\pi$.\nThe sequence $P(E_k) = 4\\pi + 4 + \\frac{2}{k}$ is monotonically decreasing, so $\\liminf_{k\\to\\infty} P(E_k) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} P(E_k) = 4\\pi + 4$.\nThe inequality is $4\\pi \\le 4\\pi + 4$, which is true.\nLower semicontinuity holds. The statement D says it fails and that the inequality is strict in the other direction ($P(E) > \\liminf P(E_k)$), which is $4\\pi > 4\\pi+4$. This is false.\n\nVerdict for D: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $\\chi_{E_k} \\to \\chi_E$ in the $BV(\\mathbb{R}^2)$ norm.**\n\nA sequence of functions $\\{u_k\\}$ converges to $u$ in the $BV(\\mathbb{R}^2)$ norm if $\\|u_k - u\\|_{BV(\\mathbb{R}^2)} \\to 0$. The BV norm is defined as $\\|u\\|_{BV} = \\|u\\|_{L^1} + TV(u)$, where $TV(u)$ is the total variation of $u$. For a characteristic function $\\chi_F$, $TV(\\chi_F)=P(F)$.\nWe test the convergence of $\\chi_{E_k}$ to $\\chi_E$:\n$$ \\|\\chi_{E_k} - \\chi_E\\|_{BV(\\mathbb{R}^2)} = \\|\\chi_{E_k} - \\chi_E\\|_{L^1(\\mathbb{R}^2)} + P(E_k \\Delta E). $$\nFrom A, we know $E_k \\Delta E = R_k$, and $\\|\\chi_{E_k} - \\chi_E\\|_{L^1} = \\mathcal{L}^2(R_k) = 2/k \\to 0$.\nThe perimeter term is $P(E_k \\Delta E) = P(R_k)$. From our calculation in B, $P(R_k) = 4 + 2\\varepsilon_k = 4 + 2/k$.\nThe limit of the perimeter term is:\n$$ \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} P(R_k) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\left(4 + \\frac{2}{k}\\right) = 4. $$\nSo, $\\|\\chi_{E_k} - \\chi_E\\|_{BV(\\mathbb{R}^2)} = \\|\\chi_{R_k}\\|_{BV(\\mathbb{R}^2)} = \\frac{2}{k} + 4 + \\frac{2}{k} \\to 4 \\neq 0$.\nThe sequence does not converge in the BV norm.\n\nVerdict for E: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. Strict lower semicontinuity holds in this example, i.e., $P(E) < \\liminf_{k\\to\\infty} P(E_k)$.**\n\nThis statement claims that the inequality from the lower semicontinuity property is strict for this example.\nWe have already computed both sides of the inequality:\n$P(E) = 4\\pi$.\n$\\liminf_{k\\to\\infty} P(E_k) = 4\\pi + 4$.\nThe inequality is $4\\pi < 4\\pi+4$, which is true.\nThis example is a classic illustration of when the perimeter is not continuous under $L^1$ convergence and the inequality in the lower semicontinuity theorem is strict. The extra perimeter from the \"neck\" $R_k$ does not vanish in the limit, even though the neck's area does.\n\nVerdict for F: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABF}$$", "id": "3049141"}]}
