The $n$-torus is defined as the quotient space $\\mathbb{T}^{n} = \\mathbb{R}^{n}/\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. This means we can identify a function $u: \\mathbb{T}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ with a function on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that is periodic with period $1$ in each coordinate variable $x_i$, for $i=1, \\dots, n$. The metric on $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$ is the flat metric inherited from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In the natural coordinate system $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ on $\\mathbb{T}^n$, the metric tensor is given by $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe Laplace–Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ is defined as the divergence of the gradient, $\\Delta u = \\mathrm{div}(\\nabla u)$. In local coordinates, this is given by $\\Delta u = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\sum_{i,j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\left( \\sqrt{\\det(g)} g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x^j} \\right)$. For the flat metric on $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$, we have $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, so the inverse metric is $g^{ij} = \\delta^{ij}$ and the determinant is $\\det(g) = 1$. The formula for the Laplacian simplifies to the standard Euclidean Laplacian:\n$$ \\Delta u = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{(\\partial x^i)^2} $$\nThe eigenvalue problem is stated as $- \\Delta u = \\lambda u$, which becomes:\n$$ - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{(\\partial x^i)^2} = \\lambda u $$\nWe are instructed to use a Fourier series representation. A smooth, square-integrable function $u(x)$ on $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$ can be expanded in a Fourier series:\n$$ u(x) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n} c_k e^{i 2\\pi \\langle k, x \\rangle} $$\nwhere $k = (k_1, \\dots, k_n)$ is a vector of integers, $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ is the coordinate vector, and $\\langle k, x \\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k_j x_j$ is the standard dot product. The functions $u_k(x) = e^{i 2\\pi \\langle k, x \\rangle}$ form a complete orthonormal basis for $L^2(\\mathbb{T}^n)$. We test whether these basis functions are eigenfunctions of the operator $- \\Delta$.\n\nLet us apply the operator to a single basis function $u_k(x) = e^{i 2\\pi \\langle k, x \\rangle}$ for a fixed $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$.\nThe partial derivative with respect to $x_j$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} e^{i 2\\pi \\sum_{l=1}^n k_l x_l} = (i 2\\pi k_j) e^{i 2\\pi \\langle k, x \\rangle} $$\nThe second partial derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u_k}{(\\partial x_j)^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left( (i 2\\pi k_j) u_k(x) \\right) = (i 2\\pi k_j)^2 u_k(x) = -4\\pi^2 k_j^2 u_k(x) $$\nNow, we compute $-\\Delta u_k$:\n$$ -\\Delta u_k = - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2 u_k}{(\\partial x_j)^2} = - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (-4\\pi^2 k_j^2 u_k(x)) = \\left( 4\\pi^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k_j^2 \\right) u_k(x) $$\nLet $|k|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k_j^2$ be the squared Euclidean norm of the integer vector $k$. The equation becomes:\n$$ -\\Delta u_k = (4\\pi^2 |k|^2) u_k $$\nThis confirms that $u_k(x) = e^{i 2\\pi \\langle k, x \\rangle}$ is an eigenfunction of $-\\Delta$ with the corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda_k = 4\\pi^2 |k|^2$.\n\nSince the set of functions $\\{u_k(x)\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n}$ forms a complete basis for $L^2(\\mathbb{T}^n)$, we have found the complete set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.\nThe eigenfunctions are $u_k(x) = e^{i 2\\pi \\langle k, x \\rangle}$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$.\nThe set of eigenvalues is $\\{\\lambda_k = 4\\pi^2 |k|^2 \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n\\}$.\n\nNext, we must determine the first positive eigenvalue, denoted $\\lambda_1$. The eigenvalues are determined by the squared norm of integer vectors $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$.\nFor $k = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$, we have $|k|^2 = 0$, which gives the eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = 4\\pi^2(0) = 0$. The corresponding eigenfunction is $u_0(x) = e^0 = 1$, the constant function. This is a non-positive eigenvalue.\n\nThe first positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ corresponds to the smallest non-zero value of $|k|^2$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The quantity $|k|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n k_j^2$ is a sum of squares of integers. For this sum to be non-zero, at least one $k_j$ must be a non-zero integer. The smallest non-zero integer squares are $(\\pm 1)^2 = 1$. Thus, the minimum non-zero value of $|k|^2$ is $1$. This minimum is achieved when exactly one component $k_j$ is equal to $\\pm 1$ and all other components are $0$. For example, for $k=(1, 0, \\dots, 0)$, we have $|k|^2 = 1^2 + 0^2 + \\dots + 0^2 = 1$.\nThe first positive eigenvalue is therefore:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = 4\\pi^2 \\cdot \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}} |k|^2 = 4\\pi^2 \\cdot 1 = 4\\pi^2 $$\n\nFinally, we must explain how this result is consistent with the Lichnerowicz estimate. The Lichnerowicz estimate for a compact $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ states that if the Ricci curvature tensor satisfies $\\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) \\geq (n-1) K g(v, v)$ for some constant $K$, then the first positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ of the operator $-\\Delta$ is bounded below by $\\lambda_1 \\geq nK$.\nFor the flat torus $\\mathbb{T}^n$, the metric is flat, which means its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. Consequently, its Ricci curvature tensor is also identically zero, $\\mathrm{Ric} = 0$. This satisfies the condition $\\mathrm{Ric} \\geq (n-1)K g$ with the constant $K=0$.\nApplying the Lichnerowicz estimate with $K=0$, we get the lower bound:\n$$ \\lambda_1 \\geq n \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nOur calculated value for the first positive eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = 4\\pi^2$. Since $4\\pi^2 > 0$, our result is fully consistent with the Lichnerowicz estimate.

The function in question is $f: S^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$, which is the restriction of the linear function $F: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $F(y) = \\langle a, y \\rangle$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is a fixed unit vector, i.e., $|a|=1$. For any point $x \\in S^n$, the position vector $x$ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the sphere at that point. The tangent space $T_x S^n$ is the set of vectors $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ such that $\\langle v, x \\rangle = 0$.\n\nFirst, we compute the gradient of $f$, denoted $\\nabla f$. According to the provided rule (i), the gradient of $f$ on the submanifold $S^n$ is the tangential projection of the gradient of the ambient function $F$. The gradient of $F(y) = \\langle a, y \\rangle$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is the constant vector field $\\tilde{\\nabla} F(y) = a$.\nTo project a vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ onto the tangent space $T_x S^n$, we use the projection operator $P_x(v) = v - \\langle v, x \\rangle x$.\nApplying this to $\\tilde{\\nabla} F(x) = a$, we find the gradient of $f$ at $x \\in S^n$:\n$$\n\\nabla f(x) = P_x(a) = a - \\langle a, x \\rangle x\n$$\nBy definition, $f(x) = \\langle a, x \\rangle$, so we can write the gradient field as:\n$$\n\\nabla f(x) = a - f(x)x\n$$\nThis vector is indeed in $T_x S^n$ since $\\langle \\nabla f(x), x \\rangle = \\langle a - f(x)x, x \\rangle = \\langle a, x \\rangle - f(x)\\langle x, x \\rangle = f(x) - f(x)(1) = 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the Hessian of $f$, defined by $\\nabla^2 f(X, Y) = \\langle \\nabla_X \\nabla f, Y \\rangle$ for tangent vector fields $X, Y$. The term $\\nabla_X \\nabla f$ is the covariant derivative of the gradient field $\\nabla f$ in the direction of $X$.
