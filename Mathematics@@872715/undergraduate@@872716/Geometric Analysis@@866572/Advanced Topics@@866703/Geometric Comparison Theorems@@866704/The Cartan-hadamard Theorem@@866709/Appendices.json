The proof hinges on showing that for any point $p \\in M$, the exponential map $\\exp_p: T_pM \\to M$ is a diffeomorphism. A key step in this proof is to establish that $\\exp_p$ is a local diffeomorphism, which is equivalent to showing that there are no conjugate points to $p$ along any geodesic starting at $p$.\n\nThe absence of conjugate points is a direct consequence of the condition $K \\le 0$.

For a Jacobi field $J(t)$ that is everywhere orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ (which we can assume without loss of generality for $J(0)=0$), the Jacobi equation can be used to analyze the evolution of its length.

It does not imply that each individual sectional curvature $K(\\text{span}\\{v, e_i\\})$ is non-positive. It is possible for some sectional curvatures to be positive, as long as they are balanced by other negative sectional curvatures.\n\nLet's evaluate each option in light of this.\n\n**A. The condition $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$ only controls an average of sectional curvatures through each direction and allows some $2$-planes to have $K  0$, which can create conjugate points via the Jacobi equation, so the exponential map need not be a covering map.**\nThis statement is perfectly accurate. As explained above, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$ is an average condition. If a Jacobi field $J(t)$ happens to lie in a $2$-plane (spanned by $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$) that has positive sectional curvature, $K  0$, the term $-K\\|J\\|^2$ in the equation for $f''(t)$ becomes negative. This introduces a focusing effect, which can cause $f(t) = \\|J(t)\\|^2$ to decrease and return to zero for some $t_1  0$. The existence of such a conjugate point means that $\\exp_p$ is not a local diffeomorphism at $t_1 \\dot{\\gamma}(0)$, and therefore cannot be a covering map. This breaks the proof of the Cartan-Hadamard theorem.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. There exist complete, simply connected manifolds with $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$ that are not diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (for example, compact simply connected Ricci-flat manifolds in dimension $n \\ge 4$), so the Cartan–Hadamard conclusion fails under $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$.**\nThis statement provides a concrete class of counterexamples to the generalized theorem. If we can find a single manifold that satisfies the hypotheses (complete, simply connected, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$) but does not satisfy the conclusion (diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$), then the generalization fails.\nBy the result of Yau's proof of the Calabi conjecture, any compact Kähler manifold with vanishing first Chern class admits a unique Ricci-flat ($ \\operatorname{Ric} = 0 $) Kähler metric. Examples of such manifolds include K3 surfaces (real dimension $n=4$) and more general Calabi-Yau manifolds. These manifolds are known to be simply connected. As compact manifolds, they are complete. Thus, they satisfy:\n1. Complete\n2. Simply connected\n3. $\\operatorname{Ric} = 0$, which implies $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$.\nHowever, being compact, they are manifestly not diffeomorphic to the non-compact space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This provides a definitive counterexample, proving that the conclusion of the Cartan-Hadamard theorem does not hold under the weaker hypothesis $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. The condition $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$ forces $\\pi_1(M)$ to be infinite, hence $M$ cannot be simply connected; therefore the hypotheses of the Cartan–Hadamard theorem can never be met under $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$.**\nThis statement is false. The condition $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$ does not force the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ to be infinite. In fact, many simply connected manifolds have $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$. For instance, Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has $\\operatorname{Ric}=0$ and is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}^n) = \\{e\\}$). The K3 surfaces mentioned in the analysis of option B are also simply connected and have $\\operatorname{Ric}=0$. The Bonnet-Myers theorem states that positive lower bounds on Ricci curvature lead to a finite fundamental group, but non-positive Ricci curvature does not have such a strong implication in the other direction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The condition $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$ forces $M$ to be flat, so the theorem would still hold; the problem is instead that completeness fails in general.**\nThis statement contains two errors. First, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$ does not imply that the manifold is flat ($K=0$). For example, hyperbolic space $H^n$ for $n \\ge 2$ has constant sectional curvature $K=-1$, which implies its Ricci curvature is $\\operatorname{Ric} = -(n-1)g  0$. It is not flat. Second, the problem is explicitly set up with \"$M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold\", so arguing that completeness fails contradicts the premises.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. By Bishop–Gromov volume comparison under $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$, the exponential map at any point is injective, so failure of the Cartan–Hadamard conclusion cannot be due to conjugate points but must be due to nonuniqueness of geodesics.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The claim that the exponential map is injective under $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$ is false. The injectivity of $\\exp_p$ on $T_pM$ is equivalent to $M$ being diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (for a complete, simply connected manifold). As established in options A and B, this conclusion fails. Specifically, the existence of conjugate points is precisely why the exponential map fails to be a local diffeomorphism, and thus fails to be injective globally. For instance, on the compact K3 surface counterexample, any point has conjugate points along some geodesic. The Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem provides volume estimates for manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded *below*, but it does not imply the injectivity of the exponential map under a $\\operatorname{Ric} \\le 0$ condition. The failure of the theorem's conclusion *is* due to the possible existence of conjugate points.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "3068554"}]}
