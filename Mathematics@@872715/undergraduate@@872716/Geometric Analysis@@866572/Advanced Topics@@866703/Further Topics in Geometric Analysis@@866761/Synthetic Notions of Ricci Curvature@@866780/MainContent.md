## Introduction
The notion of Ricci curvature is a cornerstone of Riemannian geometry, linking the local geometry of a manifold to its global topological and analytic properties. However, the classical definition, which relies on a [smooth structure](@entry_id:159394) and the Riemann [curvature tensor](@entry_id:181383), is inadequate for studying a wide range of geometric objects, such as the singular spaces that arise as limits of [smooth manifolds](@entry_id:160799). This gap has motivated the development of a synthetic theory of Ricci curvature, a powerful framework that extends the concept of a lower Ricci [curvature bound](@entry_id:634453) to the much broader setting of [metric measure spaces](@entry_id:180197).

This article provides a comprehensive introduction to the modern synthetic theory of Ricci curvature, primarily the one developed by John Lott, Karl-Theodor Sturm, and Cédric Villani. It addresses the central challenge of defining curvature without [differentiability](@entry_id:140863) by leveraging the geometric structure of the space of probability measures endowed with the Wasserstein metric from [optimal transport](@entry_id:196008). Across three chapters, you will gain a deep understanding of this elegant and powerful theory. The first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** will lay the theoretical groundwork, introducing [metric measure spaces](@entry_id:180197), the fundamentals of [optimal transport](@entry_id:196008), and the crucial concept of displacement convexity that defines the curvature-dimension condition. The second chapter, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,"** will demonstrate the theory's power by showing how it recovers and generalizes classical theorems of Riemannian geometry and forges deep connections with modern analysis and PDEs. Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** section will offer concrete exercises to solidify your understanding of these abstract concepts.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The synthetic theory of Ricci curvature provides a robust framework for extending the geometric and analytic consequences of lower Ricci [curvature bounds](@entry_id:200421) from the classical setting of smooth Riemannian manifolds to the much broader category of [metric measure spaces](@entry_id:180197). This generalization is not merely an abstract exercise; it allows for the rigorous study of singular spaces that arise as limits of [smooth manifolds](@entry_id:160799), such as Alexandrov spaces or measured Gromov-Hausdorff limits. The theory, pioneered by John Lott, Karl-Theodor Sturm, and Cédric Villani, is founded on the geometric properties of [optimal transport](@entry_id:196008). This chapter elucidates the core principles and mechanisms underpinning this modern approach to geometry.

### The Stage: Metric Measure Spaces

The fundamental object of study in this theory is the **[metric measure space](@entry_id:182495)**, a triple $(X, d, \mathfrak{m})$ that combines topological, metric, and measure-theoretic structures. To support the sophisticated machinery of optimal transport and calculus of variations, these components must satisfy certain minimal requirements [@problem_id:3064691].

1.  The space $(X, d)$ must be a **Polish space**, which is a **complete** and **separable** metric space. Completeness, the property that all Cauchy sequences converge, is essential for the existence of solutions to [variational problems](@entry_id:756445) and for the convergence of various analytic processes, such as [gradient flows](@entry_id:635964). Separability, the existence of a [countable dense subset](@entry_id:147670), ensures that the space is not "too large" from a measure-theoretic perspective. It guarantees that the space of probability measures is well-behaved and that certain classes of functions are sufficiently rich for analysis.

2.  The measure $\mathfrak{m}$ serves as a reference volume measure on $X$. It is required to be a **Borel measure**—that is, a measure defined on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra generated by the open sets of the [metric topology](@entry_id:155862). This ensures compatibility between the metric and measure structures. Furthermore, $\mathfrak{m}$ must be **finite on [bounded sets](@entry_id:157754)**. This [local finiteness](@entry_id:154085) condition ensures that the geometry is non-degenerate at small scales; for any point $x \in X$, any ball $B_r(x) = \{y \in X \mid d(x,y) \le r\}$ of finite radius $r$ has [finite measure](@entry_id:204764), $\mathfrak{m}(B_r(x))  \infty$. While the total measure $\mathfrak{m}(X)$ can be infinite, this local constraint is crucial for the theory's primarily local characterizations of curvature to be meaningful.

Examples of [metric measure spaces](@entry_id:180197) are ubiquitous and diverse. A canonical example is the Euclidean space $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_{\text{Euc}}, \mathcal{L}^n)$ with its standard distance and Lebesgue measure. A more exotic example is $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_{\text{Euc}}, \mathfrak{m})$ where $\mathfrak{m}$ is the Gaussian measure with density $\rho(x) = c \exp(-|x|^2)$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Discrete structures also fit this framework; for instance, the vertex set of a connected, locally finite graph can be endowed with the shortest-[path metric](@entry_id:262152) and the [counting measure](@entry_id:188748), forming a valid [metric measure space](@entry_id:182495) [@problem_id:3064691].

### The Tool: Optimal Transport on Metric Spaces

The key innovation of the Lott-Sturm-Villani theory is to define and detect curvature not on the space $X$ itself, but on the space of probability measures on $X$. To do this, one must first endow the space of measures with a [metric geometry](@entry_id:185748). This is achieved through the theory of [optimal transport](@entry_id:196008).

#### The Kantorovich Problem and Wasserstein Distance

Let $(X, d)$ be a Polish space. We consider the space $\mathcal{P}(X)$ of all Borel probability measures on $X$. The problem of [optimal transport](@entry_id:196008), in its modern formulation due to Leonid Kantorovich, seeks the most efficient way to transport the "mass" of a measure $\mu_0$ to match the distribution of another measure $\mu_1$.

A **transport plan**, or **coupling**, between $\mu_0$ and $\mu_1$ is a probability measure $\pi$ on the product space $X \times X$ whose marginals are $\mu_0$ and $\mu_1$. This means that for any Borel set $A \subseteq X$, we have $\pi(A \times X) = \mu_0(A)$ and $\pi(X \times A) = \mu_1(A)$. We denote the set of all such couplings by $\Pi(\mu_0, \mu_1)$. A coupling can be thought of as a probabilistic description of a transport strategy: $\pi(A \times B)$ is the amount of mass moved from set $A$ to set $B$.

Given a cost function $c(x,y)$ representing the cost of moving a unit of mass from $x$ to $y$, the Kantorovich problem is to find the plan that minimizes the total transport cost. For the synthetic theory of Ricci curvature, the most relevant cost is the **quadratic cost**, $c(x,y) = d(x,y)^2$. The minimal cost defines the **2-Wasserstein distance** $W_2$ between the measures [@problem_id:3064715]:
$$
W_2(\mu_0, \mu_1)^2 = \inf_{\pi \in \Pi(\mu_0, \mu_1)} \int_{X \times X} d(x,y)^2 \, d\pi(x,y).
$$
This distance is defined on the **Wasserstein space** $\mathcal{P}_2(X)$, which is the subset of $\mathcal{P}(X)$ consisting of measures with finite second moment, i.e., measures $\mu$ for which $\int_X d(x, x_0)^2 \, d\mu(x)  \infty$ for some (and hence any) $x_0 \in X$. This finiteness condition is precisely what ensures that the [infimum](@entry_id:140118) in the definition of $W_2$ is finite.

A fundamental theorem in [optimal transport](@entry_id:196008) guarantees the existence of a minimizer for this problem. That is, if $(X,d)$ is a Polish space and $\mu_0, \mu_1 \in \mathcal{P}_2(X)$, there always exists an **[optimal transport](@entry_id:196008) plan** $\pi^* \in \Pi(\mu_0, \mu_1)$ that attains the [infimum](@entry_id:140118). The proof is a classic application of [the direct method in the calculus of variations](@entry_id:188864). It relies on two key properties [@problem_id:3064715]:
1.  **Compactness:** The set of all couplings $\Pi(\mu_0, \mu_1)$ is compact with respect to the [weak topology](@entry_id:154352) on measures. This follows from Prokhorov's theorem, which relates tightness of a family of measures to its relative [weak compactness](@entry_id:270233). For a Polish space, any individual probability measures $\mu_0, \mu_1$ are tight, which implies the entire set of their couplings is tight and thus relatively compact.
2.  **Lower Semicontinuity:** The total [cost functional](@entry_id:268062) $\pi \mapsto \int_{X \times X} d(x,y)^2 \, d\pi(x,y)$ is lower semicontinuous with respect to the [weak topology](@entry_id:154352).

A weakly lower semicontinuous functional on a non-empty weakly [compact set](@entry_id:136957) always attains its minimum. This guarantees that [optimal transport](@entry_id:196008) plans exist, making the Wasserstein distance and its associated geometry well-defined.

#### Geodesics in the Wasserstein Space: Displacement Interpolation

The Wasserstein distance $W_2$ endows the space $\mathcal{P}_2(X)$ with a metric structure. A curve of measures $(\mu_t)_{t \in [0,1]}$ is a **[constant-speed geodesic](@entry_id:634525)** in $(\mathcal{P}_2(X), W_2)$ if it connects $\mu_0$ to $\mu_1$ and satisfies $W_2(\mu_s, \mu_t) = |t-s| W_2(\mu_0, \mu_1)$ for all $s,t \in [0,1]$.

A beautiful and powerful construction, known as **displacement interpolation**, allows one to build such geodesics by "lifting" the geodesic structure of the underlying space $(X,d)$ to the Wasserstein space $(\mathcal{P}_2(X), W_2)$ [@problem_id:3064723]. The procedure is as follows:
1.  Let $\mu_0, \mu_1 \in \mathcal{P}_2(X)$ be two probability measures. Find an optimal transport plan $\gamma \in \Pi(\mu_0, \mu_1)$ for the quadratic cost.
2.  Assume $(X,d)$ is a geodesic space. For $\gamma$-almost every pair of points $(x,y) \in X \times X$, let $\sigma^{x,y}: [0,1] \to X$ be a [constant-speed geodesic](@entry_id:634525) in $(X,d)$ connecting $x$ to $y$ (i.e., $\sigma^{x,y}(0)=x$ and $\sigma^{x,y}(1)=y$).
3.  For each $t \in [0,1]$, define the [evaluation map](@entry_id:149774) $G_t(x,y) = \sigma^{x,y}(t)$. This map pushes the coupled points $(x,y)$ to their intermediate positions at time $t$ along the geodesics connecting them.
4.  The interpolated measure $\mu_t$ is then defined as the pushforward of the optimal plan $\gamma$ by the map $G_t$: $\mu_t = (G_t)_{\#}\gamma$.

Intuitively, this construction takes the "blueprint" for transport given by the optimal plan $\gamma$ and executes it over time by moving mass along the straightest possible paths in the base space. Crucially, the optimality of the initial plan $\gamma$ ensures that the resulting curve $(\mu_t)$ is indeed a [constant-speed geodesic](@entry_id:634525) in the Wasserstein space. If a non-optimal plan were used, the resulting curve would not have minimal length.

### The Definition of Curvature: Displacement Convexity

The central thesis of the synthetic theory is that the Ricci curvature of the underlying space $(X, d, \mathfrak{m})$ is encoded in the [convexity](@entry_id:138568) properties of certain functionals along these Wasserstein geodesics.

#### The Euclidean Prototype: McCann's Theorem

The guiding principle comes from the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$. Here, thanks to Brenier's theorem, [optimal transport](@entry_id:196008) between absolutely continuous measures is deterministic: there exists a [convex function](@entry_id:143191) $\psi$ such that the optimal map is $T = \nabla \psi$. The unique $W_2$-geodesic between $\mu_0$ and $\mu_1 = T_{\#}\mu_0$ is given by linear interpolation of particle positions: $\mu_t = ((1-t)\mathrm{id} + tT)_{\#}\mu_0$.

In a seminal work, Robert McCann studied the behavior of "internal energy" functionals of the form $\mathcal{U}_U(\mu) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} U(\rho) \, d\mathcal{L}^n$, where $\mu = \rho \mathcal{L}^n$. He proved that the map $t \mapsto \mathcal{U}_U(\mu_t)$ is convex for all $W_2$-geodesics if and only if the integrand $U$ belongs to a specific class of functions, denoted $\mathcal{DC}_n$ [@problem_id:3064721]. This class is characterized by the condition that the transformed function $s \mapsto s^n U(s^{-n})$ is convex and non-increasing on $(0, \infty)$. A key example is the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy functional, where $U(s) = s \ln s$, which corresponds to $N=\infty$ in the later theory. This result, known as **displacement convexity**, establishes a direct link between the geometry of transport in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the convexity of specific functionals.

#### The General Curvature-Dimension Condition: $CD(K,N)$

The Lott-Sturm-Villani theory elevates this observation to a definition. A [metric measure space](@entry_id:182495) $(X, d, \mathfrak{m})$ is said to satisfy the **curvature-dimension condition $CD(K,N)$**, for $K \in \mathbb{R}$ and $N \in [1, \infty]$, if a suitable entropy functional is "displacement convex" along all $W_2$-geodesics, with the degree of [convexity](@entry_id:138568) depending on the parameters $K$ and $N$.

While the definition is often given in terms of the [convexity](@entry_id:138568) of an entropy functional, an equivalent and perhaps more geometrically intuitive characterization is given by a pointwise inequality governing the evolution of the density of the measure along transport paths [@problem_id:3064711]. Let $(\mu_t = \rho_t \mathfrak{m})_{t \in [0,1]}$ be a $W_2$-geodesic. This geodesic is induced by an optimal plan concentrated on a set of geodesics $\{\gamma\}$ in the base space $X$. The $CD(K,N)$ condition is equivalent to the following inequality holding for almost every such geodesic $\gamma$:
$$
\rho_t(\gamma_t)^{-1/N} \ge \tau_{K,N}^{(1-t)}\big(d(\gamma_0,\gamma_1)\big)\,\rho_0(\gamma_0)^{-1/N} + \tau_{K,N}^{(t)}\big(d(\gamma_0,\gamma_1)\big)\,\rho_1(\gamma_1)^{-1/N}.
$$
Here, the **distortion coefficients** $\tau_{K,N}^{(t)}(\theta)$ are special functions derived from the geometry of the $N$-dimensional model space of constant Ricci curvature $K$. For the flat case $K=0$, $\tau_{0,N}^{(t)}(\theta) = t$, and the inequality reduces to the statement that the function $t \mapsto \rho_t(\gamma_t)^{-1/N}$ is convex. For non-zero curvature, the linear weights $(1-t)$ and $t$ are replaced by these distortion coefficients, which encode how volumes contract or expand in a [curved space](@entry_id:158033). This inequality provides a precise, quantitative "microscopic" expression of the curvature-dimension bound.

### Connecting Synthetic and Classical Curvature

A crucial test for any synthetic theory is whether it correctly reproduces the classical theory in the smooth setting. The $CD(K,N)$ condition passes this test with flying colors.

#### From Riemannian Geometry to $CD(K,N)$

It is a fundamental theorem that a smooth, complete, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with Ricci [curvature bounded below](@entry_id:186568) by $\mathrm{Ric}_g \ge K g$ satisfies the condition $CD(K,n)$ when equipped with its [geodesic distance](@entry_id:159682) and Riemannian volume measure [@problem_id:3064736]. The proof beautifully synthesizes [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818) and optimal transport. The key steps are:
1.  The density evolution along a $W_2$-geodesic is governed by the **Monge-Ampère equation**, which relates the density $\rho_t$ at time $t$ to the initial density $\rho_0$ via the Jacobian determinant of the transport map: $\rho_0(x) = \rho_t(T_t(x)) \det(dT_t(x))$.
2.  The Jacobian determinant $\det(dT_t(x))$ measures the distortion of volume along the transport flow. Its evolution is described by **Jacobi fields**.
3.  The Jacobi equation, which governs the behavior of Jacobi fields, explicitly involves the Ricci curvature. A lower bound on the Ricci curvature provides a lower bound on the Jacobian determinant, often expressed using distortion coefficients.
4.  This Jacobian lower bound, when plugged into the Monge-Ampère equation, translates directly into a pointwise [convexity](@entry_id:138568)-like inequality for a power of the density, which upon integration yields the displacement [convexity](@entry_id:138568) of entropy required by the $CD(K,n)$ condition.

This shows that the synthetic definition is a valid generalization of the classical notion of a Ricci curvature lower bound.

#### The Bakry-Émery Perspective

An alternative but equivalent approach to curvature-dimension conditions on smooth manifolds was developed by Dominique Bakry and Michel Émery, using the tools of [semigroup theory](@entry_id:273332) and the Bochner identity. For a weighted manifold $(M, g, e^{-V}\mathrm{vol}_g)$ with associated [diffusion operator](@entry_id:136699) $L = \Delta - \langle \nabla V, \cdot \rangle$, they defined a condition, now called the Bakry-Émery $CD(K,N)$ condition, via an inequality involving the operator $L$ and its associated *carré du champ* operator. A calculation shows that this analytic condition is equivalent to a lower bound on a generalized Ricci tensor [@problem_id:3064678]:
$$
\mathrm{Ric}_{V,N} := \mathrm{Ric}_g + \nabla^2 V - \frac{1}{N-n} \nabla V \otimes \nabla V \ge K g.
$$
For the "infinite-dimensional" case $N=\infty$, this simplifies to a lower bound on the **Bakry-Émery Ricci tensor** $\mathrm{Ric}_\infty := \mathrm{Ric}_g + \nabla^2 V$. A profound result is that on a smooth manifold, this analytic Bakry-Émery condition is completely equivalent to the geometric Lott-Sturm-Villani $CD(K,N)$ condition. This equivalence provides a deep link between [optimal transport](@entry_id:196008), [diffusion processes](@entry_id:170696), and classical [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818).

### Refining the Notion: The $RCD(K,N)$ Condition

The $CD(K,N)$ condition is very general; it is satisfied by spaces that can be quite different from Riemannian manifolds, such as certain Finsler manifolds where the notion of length depends on direction. To single out the subclass of [metric measure spaces](@entry_id:180197) that are "Riemannian-like", a stronger condition is needed. This is the **Riemannian curvature-dimension condition, $RCD(K,N)$** [@problem_id:3064708].

An $RCD(K,N)$ space is a $CD(K,N)$ space that is also **infinitesimally Hilbertian**. This additional property concerns the first-order calculus on the space. The energy of a function is measured by the **Cheeger energy** $\mathrm{Ch}(f)$, a functional on $L^2(X, \mathfrak{m})$ that generalizes the classical Dirichlet energy $\frac{1}{2} \int |\nabla f|^2 d\mathfrak{m}$. A space is infinitesimally Hilbertian if this Cheeger energy is a **[quadratic form](@entry_id:153497)**, meaning it satisfies the [parallelogram law](@entry_id:137992):
$$
\mathrm{Ch}(f+g) + \mathrm{Ch}(f-g) = 2(\mathrm{Ch}(f) + \mathrm{Ch}(g)).
$$
This is equivalent to the Sobolev space $W^{1,2}(X)$ (the domain of the Cheeger energy) being a Hilbert space. Geometrically, this quadratic nature of the energy ensures that the infinitesimal "unit balls" are ellipsoids (given by an inner product), as in Riemannian geometry, rather than other convex shapes, as in Finsler geometry. Analytically, this property is equivalent to the **linearity of the heat flow**, which is the gradient flow of the Cheeger energy.

The definition $RCD(K,N) = CD(K,N) + \text{infinitesimally Hilbertian}$ successfully isolates the Riemannian-like spaces. For instance, a smooth Riemannian manifold with a lower Ricci bound is an $RCD(K,n)$ space, whereas a non-Riemannian Finsler manifold, even if it satisfies $CD(K,N)$, will not be an $RCD(K,N)$ space because its Cheeger energy is not quadratic.

### Properties and Further Concepts

The synthetic theory is rich with consequences and connections to other geometric notions.

#### Measure Contraction Property (MCP)

The **Measure Contraction Property $MCP(K,N)$** is another synthetic formulation of a lower Ricci [curvature bound](@entry_id:634453), defined by Ohta and Sturm [@problem_id:3064712]. Unlike the $CD$ condition, which compares the transport between two arbitrary measure distributions, the MCP compares the measure of a set to the measure of its image when contracted along a spray of geodesics emanating from a single point. It asserts that the measure of the contracted set is bounded below by what it would be in the corresponding $N$-dimensional [model space](@entry_id:637948) of [constant curvature](@entry_id:162122) $K$.

The MCP is a weaker condition than the CD condition. It is known that on essentially non-branching spaces, $CD(K,N)$ implies $MCP(K,N)$, but the converse is not true in general. However, MCP is strong enough to imply many classical results, most notably a synthetic version of the **Bishop-Gromov relative volume [comparison theorem](@entry_id:637672)**, which controls the growth rate of the volume of [geodesic balls](@entry_id:201133).

#### Stability under Geometric Convergence

One of the most powerful features of the synthetic theory is its robustness. Both the $CD(K,N)$ and $RCD(K,N)$ conditions are **stable under measured Gromov-Hausdorff (mGH) convergence** [@problem_id:3064698]. This means that if a sequence of [metric measure spaces](@entry_id:180197) $(X_i, d_i, \mathfrak{m}_i)$, each satisfying $RCD(K,N)$ for fixed $K$ and $N$, converges to a limit space $(X, d, \mathfrak{m})$, then the limit space also satisfies $RCD(K,N)$.

This stability is a highly non-trivial result. The proof for the stability of $CD(K,N)$ relies on the stability of optimal transport under mGH convergence, which allows one to pass the displacement convexity of entropy to the limit. To prove the stability of $RCD(K,N)$, one must additionally show that the infinitesimally Hilbertian property is preserved. This is achieved by demonstrating that the Cheeger energies of the approximating spaces converge to the Cheeger energy of the limit space in a variational sense known as **Mosco convergence**. A key property of Mosco convergence is that the limit of a sequence of [quadratic forms](@entry_id:154578) is again a quadratic form, thus ensuring the limit space remains infinitesimally Hilbertian. This stability allows geometers to use the tools of Ricci curvature to study the structure of highly singular spaces that arise as [limits of sequences](@entry_id:159667) of smooth manifolds.
