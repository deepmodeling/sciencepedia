Express your final answer as a single exact number with no units, and do not round.", "solution": "The problem asks for the injectivity radius of the flat $n$-torus $T^{n}=\\mathbb{R}^{n}/\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ at any point. The torus is endowed with the Riemannian metric induced from the standard Euclidean inner product on its universal cover $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Due to the homogeneity of the torus (the group of isometries acts transitively), the injectivity radius is constant for all points $p \\in T^n$. We can therefore perform the computation at a specific, convenient point, such as $p_0 = \\pi(0)$, where $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to T^n$ is the canonical covering projection and $0$ is the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nThe injectivity radius at a point $p$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$, denoted $\\text{inj}(p)$, is defined as the supremum of radii $r  0$ for which the exponential map $\\exp_p: B(0, r) \\subset T_pM \\to M$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image. Here, $T_pM$ is the tangent space at $p$ and $B(0, r)$ is the open ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin of $T_pM$.\n\nFor the flat torus $T^n$, the tangent space at any point can be canonically identified with $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Let us make this identification at our chosen point $p_0$: $T_{p_0}T^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$. Geodesics on $T^n$ starting at $p_0$ with an initial velocity vector $v \\in T_{p_0}T^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$ are the projections of straight lines in the universal cover $\\mathbb{R}^n$ starting at the origin $0$ with velocity $v$. The straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by the path $\\gamma_v(t) = t v$. The corresponding geodesic on the torus is $\\pi(\\gamma_v(t))$. The exponential map therefore takes a simple form: for a vector $v \\in T_{p_0}T^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$, the point reached after time $1$ along the geodesic is $\\exp_{p_0}(v) = \\pi(v)$.\n\nThe exponential map $\\exp_{p_0}: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to T^n$ fails to be injective if there exist two distinct vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\\exp_{p_0}(v_1) = \\exp_{p_0}(v_2)$. Using the explicit form of the exponential map, this condition becomes $\\pi(v_1) = \\pi(v_2)$. By the definition of the quotient manifold $T^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$, two points in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ project to the same point in $T^n$ if and only if their difference is a non-zero vector in the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Thus, $\\pi(v_1) = \\pi(v_2)$ for $v_1 \\neq v_2$ is equivalent to $v_1 - v_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nWe seek the largest radius $r  0$ such that the map $\\exp_{p_0}$ is injective on the open ball $B(0, r) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$. This means that for any two distinct vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in B(0, r)$, their difference $v_1 - v_2$ must not be a non-zero lattice vector. The set of all possible differences $\\{v_1 - v_2 \\mid v_1, v_2 \\in B(0,r)\\}$ is the open ball $B(0, 2r)$. Therefore, the condition for injectivity on $B(0,r)$ is that the ball $B(0, 2r)$ contains no non-zero lattice points:\n$$\nB(0, 2r) \\cap (\\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}) = \\emptyset\n$$\nThis implies that the radius $2r$ must be less than or equal to the norm of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Let $\\|k\\|$ be the standard Euclidean norm of a vector $k \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. The condition is:\n$$\n2r \\le \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|k\\|\n$$\nThe injectivity radius $\\text{inj}(p_0)$ is the supremum of all such $r$. This gives:\n$$\n\\text{inj}(p_0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|k\\|\n$$\nThis result connects the injectivity radius to the geometry of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Geometrically, the injectivity radius is half the length of the shortest non-trivial geodesic loop based at $p_0$. A geodesic loop at $p_0$ corresponds to a straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ from the origin $0$ to some lattice point $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The length of this loop is $\\|k\\|$. The shortest such loop corresponds to the lattice vector $k$ with the minimum non-zero norm.\n\nThe problem requires justification using the Dirichlet-Voronoi cell. The Dirichlet-Voronoi cell of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ centered at the origin is the set of points in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ that are closer to the origin than to any other lattice point:\n$$\nD = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid \\|x\\| \\le \\|x-k\\| \\text{ for all } k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n\\}\n$$\nThe interior of $D$ is a fundamental domain for the action of $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and the projection map $\\pi$ is injective on this interior. The injectivity radius at $p_0$ is the radius of the largest open ball centered at the origin that can be inscribed within this fundamental domain. The boundary of the Voronoi cell is composed of portions of the perpendicular bisector hyperplanes for segments connecting the origin to other lattice points $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The point on the boundary of $D$ closest to the origin will lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment $[0, k_0]$, where $k_0$ is a shortest non-zero lattice vector. This closest point is precisely the midpoint $\\frac{1}{2}k_0$. The distance from the origin to this point is $\\|\\frac{1}{2}k_0\\| = \\frac{1}{2}\\|k_0\\|$. This distance is the radius of the inscribed ball, which is the injectivity radius.\n\nNow, we compute this value. A vector in the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ is of the form $k = (k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_n)$ where each $k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The squared norm is $\\|k\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n k_i^2$. We need to find the minimum of this value for $k \\neq 0$. Since the components $k_i$ are integers, the smallest possible non-zero value for any $k_i^2$ is $1^2=1$. To minimize the sum, we can choose one component to be $\\pm 1$ and all other components to be $0$. For example, let $k_0 = (1, 0, \\dots, 0)$. The norm is $\\|k_0\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + \\dots + 0^2} = 1$. Any other non-zero lattice vector would have a norm greater than or equal to $1$. For instance, if two components are non-zero (e.g., $(1,1,0,\\dots,0)$), the norm is $\\sqrt{1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{2}  1$. If one component has magnitude $2$, the norm is $2  1$. Therefore, the minimum non-zero norm is indeed $1$:\n$$\n\\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|k\\| = 1\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the injectivity radius:\n$$\n\\text{inj}(p_0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nAs argued earlier, the injectivity radius is constant over the entire torus $T^n$.

The solution will be constructed by following the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nAn element of the torus $T_i^2 = \\mathbb{R}^2 / \\Lambda_i$ is an equivalence class of points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let a point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ be denoted by a vector $(x,y)$. A point in $T_i^2$ is an equivalence class $[(x,y)]_i$, where $(x_1, y_1) \\sim (x_2, y_2)$ if $(x_1-x_2, y_1-y_2)$ is an integer linear combination of $v_i = (\\varepsilon_i, 0)$ and $w=(0,L)$. That is, $x_1-x_2 = k\\varepsilon_i$ and $y_1-y_2 = mL$ for some integers $k,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The distance $d_i$ on $T_i^2$ is the quotient metric inherited from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe circle $S^1_L = \\mathbb{R} / L\\mathbb{Z}$ consists of equivalence classes $[y]_S$ of real numbers, where $y_1 \\sim y_2$ if $y_1-y_2 = mL$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The distance $d_S$ is the standard quotient metric.\n\n**Step 1: Construction of the maps $p_i : T_i^2 \\to S^1_L$**\n\nWe define a map from the universal covers, $\\tilde{p} : \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, by projecting onto the second coordinate: $\\tilde{p}((x,y)) = y$. We wish to show this descends to a well-defined map $p_i: T_i^2 \\to S^1_L$.\nLet $[(x_1,y_1)]_i = [(x_2,y_2)]_i$ be two representations of the same point in $T_i^2$. Then, for some integers $k$ and $m$, we have $x_2 = x_1 + k\\varepsilon_i$ and $y_2 = y_1+mL$.\nThe image of $(x_1,y_1)$ under $\\tilde{p}$ is $y_1$. The image of $(x_2,y_2)$ is $y_2 = y_1+mL$. In the quotient space $S^1_L = \\mathbb{R}/L\\mathbb{Z}$, the points $y_1$ and $y_1+mL$ belong to the same equivalence class, i.e., $[y_1]_S = [y_1+mL]_S$.\nThus, the map $p_i([(x,y)]_i) = [y]_S$ is well-defined.\n\nNext, we show that $p_i$ is $1$-Lipschitz. Let $P_1 = [(x_1,y_1)]_i$ and $P_2 = [(x_2,y_2)]_i$ be two points in $T_i^2$. Their distance is\n$$d_i(P_1,P_2) = \\min_{k,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\sqrt{(x_1 - (x_2+k\\varepsilon_i))^2 + (y_1-(y_2+mL))^2}$$\nThe distance between their images $p_i(P_1)=[y_1]_S$ and $p_i(P_2)=[y_2]_S$ is\n$$d_S([y_1]_S, [y_2]_S) = \\min_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |y_1 - (y_2+mL)|$$\nLet $k_0, m_0$ be the integers that realize the minimum for $d_i(P_1, P_2)$. Then\n$$d_i(P_1,P_2) = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2 - k_0\\varepsilon_i)^2 + (y_1-y_2-m_0L)^2} \\ge \\sqrt{0 + (y_1-y_2-m_0L)^2} = |y_1-y_2-m_0L|$$\nBy definition of the minimum, we have $|y_1-y_2-m_0L| \\ge \\min_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |y_1-y_2-mL| = d_S([y_1]_S, [y_2]_S)$.\nCombining these inequalities, we get $d_i(P_1,P_2) \\ge d_S(p_i(P_1), p_i(P_2))$. This shows that $p_i$ is a $1$-Lipschitz map. The map is also surjective since for any $[y]_S \\in S^1_L$, the point $[(0,y)]_i \\in T_i^2$ maps to it.\n\n**Step 2: Diameter of the fibers of $p_i$**\n\nA fiber of $p_i$ over a point $[y_0]_S \\in S^1_L$ is the set $p_i^{-1}([y_0]_S) = \\{[(x,y)]_i \\in T_i^2 \\mid [y]_S=[y_0]_S\\}$.\nWe can choose a representative for each point in the fiber of the form $(x,y_0)$. The set of such points is $\\{[(x,y_0)]_i \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\nTwo such points $[(x_1,y_0)]_i$ and $[(x_2,y_0)]_i$ are identical if and only if $x_1-x_2 = k\\varepsilon_i$ and $y_0-y_0 = mL$ for some integers $k,m$. The second condition implies $m=0$.\nSo the equivalence relation on the fiber is purely on the first coordinate: $x_1 \\sim x_2$ if $x_1-x_2=k\\varepsilon_i$.\nThis means the fiber is the space $\\mathbb{R}/\\varepsilon_i\\mathbb{Z}$ equipped with the metric induced by the standard metric on $\\mathbb{R}$. This space is a circle of circumference $\\varepsilon_i$.\nThe diameter of a circle of circumference $C$ is $C/2$. Therefore, the diameter of any fiber $p_i^{-1}([y_0]_S)$ is $\\varepsilon_i/2$.\nThis shows that $\\sup_{[y]_S \\in S^1_L} \\text{diam}(p_i^{-1}([y]_S)) = \\varepsilon_i/2$, confirming the required bound.\n\n**Step 3: Gromov–Hausdorff Convergence**\n\nTo show that $d_{GH}(T_i^2, S^1_L) \\to 0$ as $i \\to \\infty$, we estimate the distortion of the correspondence defined by the graph of $p_i$. Let $C_i = \\{(P,Q) \\in T_i^2 \\times S^1_L \\mid p_i(P)=Q\\}$. This is a correspondence since $p_i$ is surjective. The distortion is $\\text{dis}(C_i) = \\sup |d_i(P_1,P_2) - d_S(Q_1,Q_2)|$ where $(P_1,Q_1),(P_2,Q_2) \\in C_i$.\nWe have $d_S(p_i(P_1),p_i(P_2)) \\le d_i(P_1,P_2)$.\nFor the other inequality, let $P_1=[(x_1,y_1)]_i$ and $P_2=[(x_2,y_2)]_i$. The distance from $P_1$ to the fiber $p_i^{-1}(p_i(P_2))$ is\n$$d_i(P_1, p_i^{-1}(p_i(P_2))) = \\inf_{P' \\in p_i^{-1}(p_i(P_2))} d_i(P_1, P') = d_S(p_i(P_1), p_i(P_2))$$\nThis holds because the projection $p_i$ is a Riemannian submersion. To demonstrate from basics:\n$$d_i(P_1, p_i^{-1}([y_2]_S))^2 = \\inf_{u \\in \\mathbb{R}, k,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\|(x_1,y_1) - ((u,y_2) + (k\\varepsilon_i, mL))\\|^2$$\n$$= \\inf_{u, k, m} ((x_1-u-k\\varepsilon_i)^2 + (y_1-y_2-mL)^2)$$\nThe infimum over $u$ and $k$ makes the first term $0$. Thus,\n$$d_i(P_1, p_i^{-1}([y_2]_S))^2 = \\inf_m (y_1-y_2-mL)^2 = (\\min_m |y_1-y_2-mL|)^2 = d_S([y_1]_S, [y_2]_S)^2$$\nLet $P_2'$ be a point in the fiber $p_i^{-1}(p_i(P_2))$ such that $d_i(P_1,P_2') = d_i(P_1, p_i^{-1}(p_i(P_2)))$. Such a point exists by compactness of the fiber.\nUsing the triangle inequality:\n$$d_i(P_1,P_2) \\le d_i(P_1,P_2') + d_i(P_2',P_2)$$\nWe have $d_i(P_1,P_2') = d_S(p_i(P_1), p_i(P_2))$. Since $P_2$ and $P_2'$ lie in the same fiber, $d_i(P_2',P_2) \\le \\text{diam}(p_i^{-1}(p_i(P_2))) = \\varepsilon_i/2$.\nSo, $d_i(P_1,P_2) \\le d_S(p_i(P_1),p_i(P_2)) + \\varepsilon_i/2$. This gives $|d_i(P_1,P_2) - d_S(p_i(P_1),p_i(P_2))| \\le \\varepsilon_i/2$.\nThe distortion is bounded, $\\text{dis}(C_i) \\le \\varepsilon_i/2$.\nBy definition of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, $d_{GH}(T_i^2, S^1_L) = \\frac{1}{2}\\inf_C \\text{dis}(C) \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\text{dis}(C_i) \\le \\frac{1}{2}(\\varepsilon_i/2) = \\varepsilon_i/4$.\nSince $\\varepsilon_i \\to 0$ as $i \\to \\infty$, we have $\\lim_{i\\to\\infty} d_{GH}(T_i^2, S^1_L) = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: The limiting space and its radius**\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the sequence $\\{T_i^2\\}$ is the metric space $(S^1_L, d_S)$. The space $S^1_L = \\mathbb{R}/L\\mathbb{Z}$ is a $1$-dimensional manifold.

The Riemann tensor component $R^i_{jkl}$ is given by\n$$\nR^i_{jkl} = \\partial_k \\Gamma^i_{jl} - \\partial_l \\Gamma^i_{jk} + \\Gamma^m_{jl} \\Gamma^i_{mk} - \\Gamma^m_{jk} \\Gamma^i_{ml}.\n$$\nLet's compute $R^1_{212}$:\n$$\nR^1_{212} = \\partial_1 \\Gamma^1_{22} - \\partial_2 \\Gamma^1_{21} + \\Gamma^m_{22} \\Gamma^1_{m1} - \\Gamma^m_{21} \\Gamma^1_{m2}.\n$$\nUsing the computed Christoffel symbols (and that $\\Gamma^1_{21}=0$, $\\Gamma^m_{22}\\Gamma^1_{m1} = \\Gamma^1_{22}\\Gamma^1_{11} + \\Gamma^2_{22}\\Gamma^1_{21} = 0$, and $\\Gamma^m_{21}\\Gamma^1_{m2} = \\Gamma^1_{21}\\Gamma^1_{12} + \\Gamma^2_{21}\\Gamma^1_{22}$):\n$$\nR^1_{212} = \\partial_1(-a_k a_k') - 0 + 0 - \\left( \\frac{a_k'}{a_k} \\right)(-a_k a_k') = -(a_k')^2 - a_k a_k'' + (a_k')^2 = -a_k a_k''.\n$$\nThen, we lower the index: $R_{1212} = g_{1i}R^i_{212} = g_{11}R^1_{212} = 1 \\cdot (-a_k a_k'') = -a_k(x)a_k''(x)$.\nThe determinant of the metric is $\\det(g_{ij}) = g_{11}g_{22} = a_k(x)^2$.\nSo, the Gaussian curvature is:\n$$\nK_k(x) = \\frac{R_{1212}}{g_{11}g_{22}} = \\frac{-a_k(x)a_k''(x)}{a_k(x)^2} = -\\frac{a_k''(x)}{a_k(x)}.\n$$\n\n2) Uniform bound on curvature.\n\nWe are given $a_k(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{k^2} \\sin(kx)$. We compute its derivatives:\n$$\na_k'(x) = \\frac{1}{k}\\cos(kx),\n$$\n$$\na_k''(x) = -\\sin(kx).\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $K_k(x)$:\n$$\nK_k(x) = -\\frac{-\\sin(kx)}{1 + \\frac{1}{k^2}\\sin(kx)} = \\frac{\\sin(kx)}{1 + \\frac{1}{k^2}\\sin(kx)}.\n$$\nTo show that $\\sup_M |K_k|$ is bounded independently of $k$, we bound the numerator and denominator. The numerator is bounded by $|\\sin(kx)| \\le 1$. For the denominator, since $k \\ge 2$, we have $k^2 \\ge 4$. Therefore $|\\frac{1}{k^2}\\sin(kx)| \\le \\frac{1}{k^2} \\le \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThis implies the denominator is bounded as:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\le 1 + \\frac{1}{k^2}\\sin(kx) \\le 1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\implies \\frac{3}{4} \\le 1 + \\frac{1}{k^2}\\sin(kx) \\le \\frac{5}{4}.\n$$\nThe denominator is strictly positive and bounded away from zero. Thus, we can bound $|K_k(x)|$:\n$$\n|K_k(x)| = \\frac{|\\sin(kx)|}{|1 + \\frac{1}{k^2}\\sin(kx)|} \\le \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{k^2}} = \\frac{k^2}{k^2-1}.\n$$\nThe function $f(k) = \\frac{k^2}{k^2-1}$ is a decreasing function for $k \\ge 2$. Its maximum value on this domain occurs at $k=2$, which is $f(2) = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nTherefore, for all $k \\ge 2$, $\\sup_M |K_k| \\le \\frac{4}{3}$. This demonstrates that the Gaussian curvature is uniformly bounded.\n\n3) Gradient of curvature and the limit $L$.\n\nThe gradient of a scalar function $f$ is the vector field $\\nabla f$ with components $(\\nabla f)^i = g^{ij}\\partial_j f$. Since $K_k$ only depends on $x=x^1$, we have:\n$$\n(\\nabla K_k)^1 = g^{11}\\partial_1 K_k = 1 \\cdot \\frac{dK_k}{dx}, \\qquad (\\nabla K_k)^2 = g^{22}\\partial_2 K_k = 0.\n$$\nThe squared magnitude of the gradient is $|\\nabla K_k|^2 = g_{ij}(\\nabla K_k)^i(\\nabla K_k)^j = g_{11}(\\frac{dK_k}{dx})^2 = (\\frac{dK_k}{dx})^2$. Thus, $|\\nabla K_k| = |\\frac{dK_k}{dx}|$.\nWe compute the derivative of $K_k(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dK_k}{dx} = \\frac{(k\\cos(kx))\\left(1+\\frac{1}{k^2}\\sin(kx)\\right) - (\\sin(kx))\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\cos(kx)\\right)}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{k^2}\\sin(kx)\\right)^2}\n= \\frac{k\\cos(kx) + \\frac{1}{k}\\cos(kx)\\sin(kx) - \\frac{1}{k}\\cos(kx)\\sin(kx)}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{k^2}\\sin(kx)\\right)^2}\n= \\frac{k\\cos(kx)}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{k^2}\\sin(kx)\\right)^2}.\n$$\nSo, $|\\nabla K_k| = \\frac{k|\\cos(kx)|}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{k^2}\\sin(kx)\\right)^2}$. To find its supremum, we can evaluate the expression at $x=0$, where $\\cos(kx)=1$ and $\\sin(kx)=0$:\n$$\n|\\nabla K_k|(0) = \\frac{k\\cdot 1}{(1+0)^2} = k.\n$$\nThe analysis of the function $h(u) = \\frac{|\\cos u|}{(1+\\epsilon \\sin u)^2}$ with $\\epsilon=1/k^2$ shows its supremum is very close to $1$ for small $\\epsilon$, and is achieved near $u=n\\pi$. A more detailed calculation shows the supremum is $k(1+O(k^{-4}))$. Therefore, $\\sup_M |\\nabla K_k|$ behaves as $k$ for large $k$.\n\nNext, we relate $|\\nabla \\mathrm{Rm}|$ to $|\\nabla K|$. In dimension $2$, $R_{ijkl} = K(g_{ik}g_{jl}-g_{i\\ell}g_{jk})$.\nTaking the covariant derivative and using metric compatibility ($\\nabla_m g_{ij} = 0$):\n$$\n\\nabla_m R_{ijkl} = (\\nabla_m K)(g_{ik}g_{jl}-g_{i\\ell}g_{jk}) = (\\partial_m K)(g_{ik}g_{jl}-g_{i\\ell}g_{jk}).\n$$\nThe squared norm of the tensor $\\nabla \\mathrm{Rm}$ is $|\\nabla \\mathrm{Rm}|^2 = g^{mp}(\\nabla_m R_{ijkl})(\\nabla_p R^{ijkl})$.\n$$\n|\\nabla \\mathrm{Rm}|^2 = g^{mp}(\\partial_m K)(\\partial_p K) \\cdot \\left[ (g_{ik}g_{jl}-g_{i\\ell}g_{jk})(g^{ia}g^{jb}g^{kc}g^{ld}(g_{ac}g_{bd}-g_{ad}g_{bc})) \\right].\n$$\nThe first term is $g^{mp}(\\partial_m K)(\\partial_p K) = |\\nabla K|^2$. The term in brackets is the squared norm of the tensor $S_{ijkl}=g_{ik}g_{jl}-g_{i\\ell}g_{jk}$, which is $|S|^2 = 2n(n-1)$. For $n=2$, $|S|^2=4$.\nSo, $|\\nabla \\mathrm{Rm}|^2 = 4|\\nabla K|^2$, which implies $|\\nabla \\mathrm{Rm}| = 2|\\nabla K|$ pointwise.\nFinally, we compute the limit $L$:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{k}\\,\\sup_{M} |\\nabla \\mathrm{Rm}(g_{k})| = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{k}\\,\\sup_{M} (2|\\nabla K_k|) = 2 \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{k}\\,\\sup_{M} |\\nabla K_k|.\n$$\nAs established, $\\sup_M |\\nabla K_k| = k \\sup_u \\frac{|\\cos u|}{(1+(1/k^2)\\sin u)^2} = k \\cdot C_k$, where $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} C_k = 1$.\n$$\nL = 2 \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{k} (k \\cdot C_k) = 2 \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} C_k = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2.\n$$\n\n4) Explanation regarding precompactness.\n\nCheeger-Gromov compactness theory states that a sequence of pointed Riemannian manifolds with uniform lower bounds on injectivity radius and uniform bounds on sectional curvature is precompact in the $C^{1,\\alpha}$ topology. Here, the manifold $M$ is fixed, the injectivity radius is uniformly bounded below, and the Gaussian (sectional) curvature $K_k$ is uniformly bounded. These conditions guarantee $C^{1,\\alpha}$ precompactness for any $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$.\n\nHowever, $C^{m,\\alpha}$ precompactness for $m \\ge 2$ requires stronger conditions, namely uniform bounds on the curvature tensor and its first $m-2$ covariant derivatives. For $C^{2,\\alpha}$ precompactness, a uniform bound on $|\\nabla \\mathrm{Rm}|$ is needed. In our case:\n$$\n\\sup_M |\\nabla \\mathrm{Rm}(g_k)| = 2 \\sup_M |\\nabla K_k| \\approx 2k.\n$$\nThis quantity is not uniformly bounded as $k \\to \\infty$. The lack of a uniform bound on the first derivative of the curvature tensor is precisely the reason why the sequence fails to be precompact in the $C^{2,\\alpha}$ topology.\n\nIn the framework of elliptic regularity, this can be understood by considering harmonic coordinates. In such coordinates, the metric components $g_{ij}$ satisfy a system of elliptic partial differential equations of the form $\\Delta_g g_{ij} \\approx \\mathrm{Ric}(g)_{ij}$. Standard Schauder estimates from elliptic theory state that if the source term (the Ricci tensor) is uniformly bounded in $C^{m-2,\\alpha}$, then the solution (the metric) is uniformly bounded in $C^{m,\\alpha}$.\n\nFor $C^{2,\\alpha}$ regularity of the metric, we would need the Ricci tensor to be uniformly in $C^{0,\\alpha}$. In dimension $2$, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = K g_{ij}$. As the metrics $g_k$ are uniformly controlled, this essentially requires the Gaussian curvature functions $K_k$ to be uniformly bounded in $C^{0,\\alpha}$. A uniform $C^{0,\\alpha}$ bound implies that the functions are uniformly Lipschitz (for $\\alpha=1$) or at least uniformly Hölder continuous. A necessary condition for a sequence of functions to be uniformly Lipschitz is that their gradients are uniformly bounded.\n\nWe found that $\\sup_M |\\nabla K_k| \\to \\infty$. This implies that the sequence of functions $\\{K_k\\}$ is not uniformly Lipschitz, and therefore not uniformly bounded in any $C^{0,\\alpha}$ space for $\\alpha \\in (0,1]$. Consequently, the source term in the elliptic equation for the metric is not regular enough to guarantee $C^{2,\\alpha}$ estimates on the metric itself. This failure of the functions $K_k$ to be equicontinuous is the manifestation of the high-frequency oscillations $\\sin(kx)$ which, while small in amplitude ($1/k^2$), have large derivatives.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3042389"}]}
