This means there exists a fixed point $p \\in N$ such that $u(x) = p$ for all $x \\in M$. We will analyze each of the quantities mentioned in the problem statement under this condition.\n\nFirst, we consider the differential of $u$, denoted $du$. The differential $du$ is a section of the tensor bundle $T^*M \\otimes u^*TN$. At any point $x \\in M$, $(du)_x$ is a linear map from the tangent space $T_xM$ to the tangent space $T_{u(x)}N = T_p N$. For any tangent vector $X \\in T_xM$, the vector $(du)_x(X) \\in T_pN$ is defined as the derivative of the curve $t \\mapsto u(c(t))$ at $t=0$, where $c$ is any smooth curve in $M$ with $c(0)=x$ and $c'(0)=X$. Since $u(c(t)) = p$ for all $t$, the curve $u \\circ c$ is constant. Its derivative is therefore the zero vector in $T_pN$. Thus, we have:\n$$ (du)_x(X) = 0 $$\nfor all $X \\in T_xM$ and for all $x \\in M$. This implies that the differential $du$ is the zero section of the bundle $T^*M \\otimes u^*TN$, which we write as $du \\equiv 0$.\n\nNext, we analyze the energy density of $u$, defined as $e(u) = \\frac{1}{2}|du|^2$. The squared norm $|du|^2$ at a point $x \\in M$ is given by $\\operatorname{tr}_g(du^* \\circ du)$, where $du^*$ is the adjoint of $du$. In local coordinates, $|du|^2 = g^{ij}h_{\\alpha\\beta} (du)_i^\\alpha (du)_j^\\beta$. Since $du \\equiv 0$, its components $(du)_i^\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial u^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i}$ are all zero. Consequently, its norm is zero at every point:\n$$ |du|^2(x) = 0 \\quad \\forall x \\in M $$\nTherefore, the energy density $e(u)$ is the constant function $0$ on $M$:\n$$ e(u) = \\frac{1}{2} (0) = 0 $$\n\nThe Bochner identity in question has the Laplace-Beltrami operator applied to the energy density, $\\Delta e(u)$, as its left-hand side. The Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ acts on a smooth function $\\phi$ by $\\Delta \\phi = \\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{grad} \\phi)$. Since $e(u)$ is the constant function $0$ on $M$, its gradient is the zero vector field, $\\operatorname{grad}(e(u)) = 0$. The divergence of the zero vector field is zero. Hence, the left-hand side of the Bochner identity vanishes identically:\n$$ \\Delta e(u) = \\Delta(0) = 0 $$\n\nNow, we examine the terms on the right-hand side of the identity. The problem states that this side is a linear combination of complete contractions of the tensors $du$, $\\nabla du$, $\\tau(u)$, $R^N$ pulled back via $du$, and $\\operatorname{Ric}^M$ acted upon by $du$. We will show that each of these fundamental building blocks is zero.\n\nWe have already established that $du \\equiv 0$.\n\nLet's consider the covariant derivative of $du$, denoted $\\nabla du$. This is the covariant derivative of the zero tensor field. The covariant derivative of a constant tensor field (in this case, the zero tensor) is zero. To be explicit, the formula for the components of $\\nabla du$ is:\n$$ (\\nabla_k du)_i^\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial (du)_i^\\alpha}{\\partial x^k} - \\Gamma_{ki}^j (du)_j^\\alpha + {^N\\Gamma}_{\\beta\\gamma}^\\alpha(u) \\frac{\\partial u^\\beta}{\\partial x^k} (du)_i^\\gamma $$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ and $^N\\Gamma$ are the Christoffel symbols for $(M,g)$ and $(N,h)$ respectively. Since $u$ is constant, $\\frac{\\partial u^\\beta}{\\partial x^k}=0$, which means $(du)_k^\\beta=0$. As $du$ is the zero tensor field, all its components $(du)_i^\\alpha$ are zero, and so are their partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial (du)_i^\\alpha}{\\partial x^k}$. All three terms on the right-hand side of the equation for $(\\nabla_k du)_i^\\alpha$ are zero. Thus, $\\nabla du \\equiv 0$.\n\nNext, we consider the tension field $\\tau(u)$, which is defined as the trace of $\\nabla du$:\n$$ \\tau(u) = \\operatorname{tr}_g(\\nabla du) $$\nIn local coordinates, $\\tau(u)^\\alpha = g^{ij}(\\nabla_i du)_j^\\alpha$. Since we have shown that $\\nabla du \\equiv 0$, all of its components are zero. It follows that its trace must also be zero. Thus, $\\tau(u) \\equiv 0$.\n\nAny summand on the right-hand side of the Bochner identity is a complete contraction of a tensor product involving one or more of the following tensors:\n1.  $du$: Any term that is a multilinear function of $du$ (e.g., a contraction of a tensor product containing $du$ as a factor) must be zero, as we are contracting with a zero tensor.\n2.  $\\nabla du$: Similarly, any term involving $\\nabla du$ as a factor must be zero. A common term in Bochner identities is $|\\nabla du|^2$, which is clearly $0$ since $\\nabla du \\equiv 0$.\n3.  $\\tau(u)$: Any term involving the tension field $\\tau(u)$ as a factor must be zero.\n4.  $R^N$ pulled back via $du$: Terms involving the curvature of the target manifold $N$ are typically of the form $\\langle R^N(du(X), du(Y))du(Z), du(W)\\rangle$. Since $du$ maps every vector to the zero vector, these terms take the form $\\langle R^N(0,0)0,0\\rangle$. By the multilinearity of the Riemann tensor $R^N$, this expression is zero.\n5.  $\\operatorname{Ric}^M$ acted upon by $du$: Terms involving the Ricci curvature of the domain manifold $M$ are typically of the form $\\operatorname{tr}_g(X \\mapsto \\langle du(\\operatorname{Ric}^M(X)), du(Y)\\rangle)$ for some $Y$ also constructed from basis vectors. Since $du \\equiv 0$, the expression inside the trace is always zero. For example, a standard term is $-\\operatorname{tr}_g(du \\circ \\operatorname{Ric}^M \\circ du^*)$, which is zero if $du=0$.\n\nSince every one of the fundamental tensors $du$, $\\nabla du$, and $\\tau(u)$ is identically zero for a constant map $u$, any term constructed as a contraction of a tensor product involving any of these tensors must also be zero. The problem statement guarantees that all terms on the right-hand side are of this nature. Therefore, every summand on the right-hand side of the identity is pointwise zero on $M$. The sum of these terms is consequently zero.\n\nIn conclusion, for a constant map $u$, both the left-hand side, $\\Delta e(u)$, and the right-hand side of any standard Bochner identity for harmonic maps are identically zero as functions on $M$. The common value of the two sides at any point of $M$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3025936"}, {"introduction": "After confirming the formula for a trivial map, we now explore the simplest non-trivial case: a linear map between flat Euclidean spaces.

For a hypersurface, this equation simplifies. For any tangent vectors $X, Y, Z, W \\in T_pM$ at a point $p \\in M$, the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ of $M$ satisfies:\n$$g(R(X,Y)Z, W) = \\bar{g}(\\bar{R}(X,Y)Z, W) + g(II(X,W), II(Y,Z)) - g(II(X,Z), II(Y,W))$$\nSince $\\bar{R} = 0$, the Gauss equation becomes:\n$$g(R(X,Y)Z, W) = g(II(X,W), II(Y,Z)) - g(II(X,Z), II(Y,W))$$\nThe term on the right-hand side represents a product of scalars, as the second fundamental form $II$ is scalar-valued.\n\nOur first step is to compute the second fundamental form $II$ for the embedding $S^m \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$. The second fundamental form is defined by $II(X,Y) = g(S(X),Y)$, where $S$ is the shape operator (or Weingarten map).
