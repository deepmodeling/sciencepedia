We will address them sequentially.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the first five von Neumann ordinals**\n\nWe start with the definition of the first ordinal, $0$, as the empty set and iteratively apply the successor operation $S(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\cup \\{\\alpha\\}$ to construct the subsequent ordinals. The notation for a finite ordinal $n$ corresponds to the set of all preceding ordinals: $n = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\nThe first five ordinals are denoted $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.

This verification applies for $\\alpha \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\n- For $\\alpha = 0$:\n$$S(0) = 0 \\cup \\{0\\} = \\emptyset \\cup \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$$\nThis is precisely our constructed ordinal $1$.

It is a limit ordinal. Therefore, to compute $1+\\omega$, we must use the third case of the recursive definition with $\\alpha = 1$ and $\\lambda = \\omega$. The ordinals $\\gamma$ such that $\\gamma  \\omega$ are precisely the finite ordinals, which we denote by $n$.\n\n$$1+\\omega = \\sup_{n  \\omega} (1+n)$$\n\nLet us examine the terms $1+n$ for finite ordinals $n \\in \\omega$:\n- For $n=0$: $1+0 = 1$.\n- For $n=1$: $1+1 = (1+0)+1 = 1+1 = 2$.\n- For $n=2$: $1+2 = (1+1)+1 = 2+1 = 3$.\n- In general, for any finite ordinal $n$, the sum $1+n$ corresponds to the standard addition of natural numbers and results in the ordinal successor of $n$. That is, for $n \\in \\omega$, $1+n$ is the standard finite ordinal $n+1$.\n\nThe set of ordinals for which we must compute the supremum is therefore:\n$$\\{1+n \\mid n  \\omega\\} = \\{1+0, 1+1, 1+2, \\dots\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$$\nThis is the set of all non-zero finite ordinals.

This illustrates that ordinal addition is not commutative, as we will see that $\\omega+1 \\neq \\omega$.\n\n**Computation of $\\omega+1$**\n\nTo compute $\\omega+1$, we use the second case of the recursive definition for a successor ordinal. Here, $\\alpha = \\omega$ and the second term is $1$, which is the successor of $0$, i.e., $1 = 0+1$.\n\n$$\\omega+1 = \\omega + (0+1)$$\nApplying the rule $\\alpha + (\\beta+1) = (\\alpha+\\beta)+1$ with $\\beta=0$:\n$$\\omega + (0+1) = (\\omega+0)+1$$\nNext, we apply the base case of the recursion, $\\alpha+0 = \\alpha$, with $\\alpha=\\omega$:\n$$\\omega+0 = \\omega$$\nSubstituting this result back gives:\n$$\\omega+1 = (\\omega)+1 = \\omega+1$$\nThe expression $\\omega+1$ is itself a closed-form ordinal expression. By definition, it is the successor of $\\omega$, which is the ordinal $\\omega \\cup \\{\\omega\\}$. This is the smallest ordinal that is strictly greater than $\\omega$. It is distinct from $\\omega$, since $\\omega \\notin \\omega$ but $\\omega \\in \\omega \\cup \\{\\omega\\}$. Therefore, the result is simply $\\omega+1$.\n\n**Computation of $\\omega+\\omega$**\n\nTo compute $\\omega+\\omega$, we again recognize that the second term, $\\omega$, is a limit ordinal. We apply the third case of the definition with $\\alpha = \\omega$ and $\\lambda = \\omega$.\n\n$$\\omega+\\omega = \\sup_{n  \\omega} (\\omega+n)$$\nThe set of ordinals for which we must take the supremum is $\\{\\omega+n \\mid n  \\omega\\}$.

This is by definition the limit of the sequence $\\omega, \\omega+1, \\omega+2, \\dots$. This ordinal is commonly denoted as $\\omega+\\omega$ or, using ordinal multiplication, as $\\omega \\cdot 2$. To formally justify this, we can show that $\\omega+\\omega$ matches the recursive definition of $\\omega \\cdot 2$.\n\nOrdinal multiplication $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ is defined by:\n1.  $\\alpha \\cdot 0 = 0$\n2.  $\\alpha \\cdot (\\beta+1) = (\\alpha \\cdot \\beta) + \\alpha$\n3.  $\\alpha \\cdot \\lambda = \\sup_{\\gamma  \\lambda} (\\alpha \\cdot \\gamma)$ for a limit ordinal $\\lambda$.\n\nLet's compute $\\omega \\cdot 2$:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot 2 = \\omega \\cdot (1+1) $$\nUsing the second rule with $\\beta=1$:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot (1+1) = (\\omega \\cdot 1) + \\omega $$\nNow we must compute $\\omega \\cdot 1$:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega \\cdot (0+1) = (\\omega \\cdot 0) + \\omega = 0 + \\omega $$\nUsing the limit rule for addition, we have $0+\\omega = \\sup_{n  \\omega} (0+n) = \\sup_{n  \\omega} n = \\omega$.\nSo, $\\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\omega \\cdot 2$:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot 2 = (\\omega) + \\omega = \\omega+\\omega $$\nThis confirms that the sum $\\omega+\\omega$ is precisely the ordinal $\\omega \\cdot 2$. This represents the order type of two copies of $\\omega$ placed sequentially. It is the least upper bound of the set $\\{\\omega+n \\mid n  \\omega\\}$. The expression $\\omega \\cdot 2$ is the standard closed form.\n\nIn summary, the three computations yield:\n1.  $1+\\omega = \\omega$\n2.  $\\omega+1$\n3.  $\\omega+\\omega = \\omega \\cdot 2$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\omega  \\omega+1  \\omega \\cdot 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2978529"}, {"introduction": "Why is ordinal multiplication not commutative?

Proof that $(X,\\prec_{A})$ and $(X,\\prec_{B})$ are well-orders.**\n\nA total order is a well-order if and only if every non-empty subset has a least element.\n\nFor $(X, \\prec_{A})$: Let $S$ be a non-empty subset of $X$. Let $\\pi_1: X \\to \\mathbb{N}$ be the projection onto the first coordinate, so $\\pi_1(n,i) = n$. Consider the set $S_N = \\pi_1(S) = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\exists i \\in \\{0,1\\}, (n,i) \\in S \\}$. Since $S$ is non-empty, $S_N$ is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{N}$. Because $(\\mathbb{N},)$ is a well-order, $S_N$ has a least element, which we denote by $n_0$. Now, consider the set $S_I = \\{ i \\in \\{0,1\\} \\mid (n_0, i) \\in S \\}$. This set is a non-empty subset of $\\{0,1\\}$. As $\\{0,1\\}$ with the order $01$ is well-ordered, $S_I$ has a least element, which we denote by $i_0$. The element $(n_0, i_0)$ belongs to $S$. We claim it is the least element of $S$ under $\\prec_A$. Let $(m,j)$ be an arbitrary element of $S$. By the definition of $n_0$, we have $n_0 \\leq m$.\n- If $n_0  m$, then by the definition of $\\prec_A$, $(n_0, i_0) \\prec_A (m,j)$.\n- If $n_0 = m$, then $(m,j)$ is of the form $(n_0, j)$. Since $(n_0, j) \\in S$, it follows that $j \\in S_I$. By the definition of $i_0$, we have $i_0 \\leq j$. If $i_0  j$, then $(n_0, i_0) \\prec_A (n_0, j)$. If $i_0 = j$, then $(n_0, i_0) = (n_0, j) = (m,j)$.\nThus, for any $(m,j) \\in S$, we have $(n_0, i_0) \\preceq_A (m,j)$. Therefore, $(n_0, i_0)$ is the least element of $S$. This proves that $(X, \\prec_A)$ is a well-order.\n\nFor $(X, \\prec_{B})$: Let $S$ be a non-empty subset of $X$. Let $\\pi_2: X \\to \\{0,1\\}$ be the projection onto the second coordinate. The set $S_I = \\pi_2(S) = \\{ i \\in \\{0,1\\} \\mid \\exists n \\in \\mathbb{N}, (n,i) \\in S \\}$ is a non-empty subset of $\\{0,1\\}$. Since $\\{0,1\\}$ is well-ordered, $S_I$ has a least element, $i_0$. Now, consider the set $S_N = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid (n, i_0) \\in S \\}$. This set is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ (because $i_0$ was chosen from $S_I$). Since $\\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered, $S_N$ has a least element, $n_0$. The element $(n_0, i_0)$ is in $S$. We claim it is the least element of $S$ under $\\prec_B$. Let $(m,j)$ be an arbitrary element of $S$. By the definition of $i_0$, we have $i_0 \\leq j$.\n- If $i_0  j$, then by the definition of $\\prec_B$, $(n_0, i_0) \\prec_B (m,j)$.\n- If $i_0 = j$, then $(m,j)$ is of the form $(m, i_0)$. Since $(m, i_0) \\in S$, it follows that $m \\in S_N$. By the definition of $n_0$, we have $n_0 \\leq m$. If $n_0  m$, then $(n_0, i_0) \\prec_B (m, i_0)$. If $n_0 = m$, then $(n_0, i_0) = (m,i_0) = (m,j)$.\nThus, for any $(m,j) \\in S$, we have $(n_0, i_0) \\preceq_B (m,j)$. Therefore, $(n_0, i_0)$ is the least element of $S$. This proves that $(X, \\prec_B)$ is a well-order.\n\n**2. Determination of Order Types and Cantor Normal Forms.**\n\nFor $(X, \\prec_{A})$: The order relation $(n,i)\\prec_{A}(m,j)$ prioritizes the first coordinate $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This is the standard lexicographical order on $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\{0,1\\}$. This structure corresponds to an $\\omega$-sequence of blocks, where each block is indexed by $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and has the order type of $\\{0,1\\}$, which is $2$.\n$$\n\\underbrace{(0,0), (0,1)}_{\\text{block } n=0} \\prec_{A} \\underbrace{(1,0), (1,1)}_{\\text{block } n=1} \\prec_{A} \\underbrace{(2,0), (2,1)}_{\\text{block } n=2} \\prec_{A} \\cdots\n$$\nThis arrangement corresponds to the ordinal sum $2+2+2+\\cdots$ ($\\omega$ times). According to the standard definition of ordinal multiplication, an $\\omega$-indexed sum of the ordinal $2$ is the product $2 \\cdot \\omega$. The order type is $2 \\cdot \\omega = \\omega$. This can be seen by the explicit order-isomorphism $f: X \\to \\mathbb{N}$ given by $f(n,i) = 2n+i$. The Cantor Normal Form of $\\omega$ is $\\omega^1 \\cdot 1$.\n\nFor $(X, \\prec_{B})$: The order relation $(n,i)\\prec_{B}(m,j)$ prioritizes the second coordinate $i \\in \\{0,1\\}$. This is the anti-lexicographical order. It divides $X$ into two main blocks corresponding to $i=0$ and $i=1$.\n- The first block consists of all elements $(n,0)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, ordered by $n$. This is the set $\\{(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), \\ldots \\}$, which is order-isomorphic to $\\mathbb{N}$ and has order type $\\omega$.\n- The second block consists of all elements $(n,1)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, ordered by $n$. This is the set $\\{(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), \\ldots \\}$, which is also order-isomorphic to $\\mathbb{N}$ and has order type $\\omega$.\nEvery element in the first block comes before every element in the second block. The overall structure is a copy of $\\omega$ followed by another copy of $\\omega$. This is precisely the definition of the ordinal sum $\\omega+\\omega$. Using the definition of ordinal multiplication where $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ is a $\\beta$-indexed sum of $\\alpha$, this structure corresponds to the product $\\omega \\cdot 2$. The order type is $\\omega \\cdot 2 = \\omega+\\omega$. The Cantor Normal Form of $\\omega \\cdot 2$ is $\\omega^1 \\cdot 2$.\n\n**3. Explanation of Non-Commutativity of Ordinal Multiplication.**\n\nOur analysis has shown that $\\text{type}(X, \\prec_A) = 2 \\cdot \\omega = \\omega$ and $\\text{type}(X, \\prec_B) = \\omega \\cdot 2 = \\omega + \\omega$. The ordinals $\\omega$ and $\\omega+\\omega$ are not equal, demonstrating the non-commutativity of ordinal multiplication. This inequality can be explained by examining the structural differences in the placement of limit points.\n\nAn element $y$ in a well-ordered set is a limit element if it is not the minimum element and has no immediate predecessor.\n- In $(X, \\prec_A)$, which has order type $\\omega$: The elements are $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), \\ldots$. The first element $(0,0)$ is the minimum. Every other element has an immediate predecessor: the predecessor of $(n,1)$ is $(n,0)$ for any $n$, and the predecessor of $(n,0)$ for $n>0$ is $(n-1,1)$. Thus, there are no limit elements within the set $(X, \\prec_A)$. The order type $\\omega$ is itself a limit ordinal, signifying the order has no largest element, but no element *in* the ordering is a limit point.\n\n- In $(X, \\prec_B)$, which has order type $\\omega \\cdot 2$: The elements are an $\\omega$-sequence $\\{(n,0)\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ followed by another $\\omega$-sequence $\\{(n,1)\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$. Consider the element $(0,1)$, which is the first element of the second sequence. The set of its predecessors is the entire first sequence, $P = \\{(n,0) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. This set $P$ has no maximal element, since for any $(n,0) \\in P$, the element $(n+1,0)$ is also in $P$ and is greater. Therefore, $(0,1)$ has no immediate predecessor. Since it is not the minimum element of $(X, \\prec_B)$, it is a limit element.\n\nThe set of \"tails\" refers to subsets of the form $\\{x \\in S \\mid x \\ge y\\}$ for some $y \\in S$. In $(X, \\prec_B)$, the tail starting from $(0,1)$ is the set $\\{(n,1) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, and its least element, $(0,1)$, is a limit point. In contrast, in $(X, \\prec_A)$, no tail has a limit point as its least element.\n\nThe existence of a limit element in $(X, \\prec_B)$ and the absence of any in $(X, \\prec_A)$ is a fundamental structural difference. An order-isomorphism must preserve the property of being a limit element. Since $(X, \\prec_A)$ and $(X, \\prec_B)$ differ in their sets of limit elements, they cannot be order-isomorphic. Consequently, their order types, $2 \\cdot \\omega = \\omega$ and $\\omega \\cdot 2$, must be different.
