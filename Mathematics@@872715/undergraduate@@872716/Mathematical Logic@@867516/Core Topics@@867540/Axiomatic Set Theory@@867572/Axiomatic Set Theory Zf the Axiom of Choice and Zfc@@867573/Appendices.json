The starting sets are $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\n1.  Let $S_1 = \\{a, b\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Pairing to the sets $a$ and $b$.\n2.  Let $S_2 = \\{c\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Pairing to the set $c$ with itself, i.e., $\\{c,c\\}$.\n3.  Let $S_3 = \\{S_1, S_2\\} = \\{\\{a, b\\}, \\{c\\}\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Pairing to the sets $S_1$ and $S_2$, which were constructed in the previous steps.\n4.  Let $S_4 = \\bigcup S_3 = \\bigcup \\{\\{a, b\\}, \\{c\\}\\} = \\{a,b,c\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Union to the set $S_3$.\n\nThis sequence of 4 distinct axiom applications successfully constructs the set $\\{a,b,c\\}$. Therefore, the minimal number of applications, $N_3$, is at most $4$.\n\nTo prove that $N_3=4$, we must show that it is not possible to construct $\\{a,b,c\\}$ in fewer than $4$ steps.\n-   The set $\\{a,b,c\\}$ has $3$ elements. The Axiom of Pairing can create sets with at most $2$ distinct elements. Therefore, the final step in any a construction of $\\{a,b,c\\}$ must be an application of the Axiom of Union.\n-   Let this final, $k^{th}$, step be the formation of $\\{a,b,c\\} = \\bigcup X$ for some set $X$. For this to be possible, the set $X$ must be available after $k-1$ steps.\n-   The set $X$ must be a set of sets, for instance $X=\\{A,B\\}$, such that $A \\cup B = \\{a,b,c\\}$. If $X$ were a-singleton, say $X=\\{Y\\}$, then $\\bigcup X=Y$. This would imply $Y=\\{a,b,c\\}$, meaning the set we aim to construct must already exist before the final step, which is a contradiction. Thus, $X$ must have at least two elements.\n-   The simplest such set $X$ to construct is a pair, $X=\\{A,B\\}$. Creating $X$ via the Axiom of Pairing requires $1$ application, and this can only be done after both $A$ and $B$ are available.\n-   Let's consider the most efficient partition of $\\{a,b,c\\}$ into two sets, for example $A=\\{a,b\\}$ and $B=\\{c\\}$.\n-   The set $A=\\{a,b\\}$ is not one of the initial sets, so it must be constructed. This requires $1$ application of the Axiom of Pairing.\n-   The set $B=\\{c\\}$ is also not one of the initial sets. It must be constructed, requiring $1$ application of the Axiom of Pairing ($B = \\{c,c\\}$).\n-   To construct $X=\\{A,B\\}$, we need both $A$ and $B$ to be available. The construction of $A$ and $B$ requires a total of $2$ axiom applications.\n-   So, a minimal sequence of applications is as follows:\n    1.  Application 1: Construct $A=\\{a,b\\}$.\n    2.  Application 2: Construct $B=\\{c\\}$.\n    3.  Application 3: With $A$ and $B$ now available, construct $X=\\{A,B\\}$.\n    4.  Application 4: With $X$ now available, construct $\\bigcup X = \\{a,b,c\\}$.\n-   This timeline shows that a minimum of $4$ applications are necessary. At the end of $2$ steps, we can have $A$ and $B$. At the end of $3$ steps, we can have $X$. The final set $\\{a,b,c\\}$ can thus only be obtained at step $4$. Any other partition of $\\{a,b,c\\}$ (e.g., $A=\\{a\\}$ and $B=\\{b,c\\}$, or $A=\\{a,b\\}$ and $B=\\{a,c\\}$) leads to the same minimal count of $4$ steps.\n-   Therefore, $N_3 = 4$.\n\n### Construction and Calculation of $N_4$\n\nNext, we provide an explicit construction of the set $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$. The starting sets are $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\n1.  Let $T_1 = \\{a, b\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Pairing.\n2.  Let $T_2 = \\{c, d\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Pairing.\n3.  Let $T_3 = \\{T_1, T_2\\} = \\{\\{a, b\\}, \\{c, d\\}\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Pairing to the sets $T_1$ and $T_2$.\n4.  Let $T_4 = \\bigcup T_3 = \\bigcup \\{\\{a, b\\}, \\{c, d\\}\\} = \\{a,b,c,d\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Union to the set $T_3$.\n\nThis sequence of 4 axiom applications constructs the set $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$. Thus, $N_4 \\le 4$.\n\nTo prove $N_4 = 4$, we use the same reasoning as for $N_3$.\n-   The construction of a $4$-element set must terminate with the Axiom of Union. Let the final step be $\\{a,b,c,d\\} = \\bigcup X$.\n-   The set $X$ must be a set of sets, constructed in the preceding steps. As before, $X$ cannot be a singleton.\n-   The most efficient way to form $X$ is as a pair, $X=\\{A,B\\}$, where $A \\cup B = \\{a,b,c,d\\}$. This requires $1$ application of Pairing, once $A$ and $B$ are available.\n-   The most efficient partition of $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$ is into two pairs, for instance $A=\\{a,b\\}$ and $B=\\{c,d\\}$.\n-   The construction of $A=\\{a,b\\}$ requires $1$ application of Pairing.\n-   The construction of $B=\\{c,d\\}$ requires $1$ application of Pairing.\n-   Thus, a total of $2$ applications are needed to have $A$ and $B$ available.\n-   The minimal sequence of applications is:\n    1.  Application 1: Construct $A=\\{a,b\\}$.\n    2.  Application 2: Construct $B=\\{c,d\\}$.\n    3.  Application 3: Construct $X=\\{A,B\\}$.\n    4.  Application 4: Construct $\\bigcup X = \\{a,b,c,d\\}$.\n-   This demonstrates that a minimum of 4 applications are necessary to construct $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$.\n-   Therefore, $N_4=4$.\n\nThe minimal number of axiom applications required to obtain $\\{a,b,c\\}$ is $N_3=4$. The minimal number of axiom applications required to obtain $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$ is $N_4=4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4  4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3038052"}, {"introduction": "Having learned to construct sets from the ground up, we now turn to refining them.

This axiom allows us to form subsets of *pre-existing* sets. It cannot create a set whose elements are \"too large\" to be collected into an already existing container set.\n- **Axiom Schema of Replacement:** Given a set $A$ and a definable function $F$ whose domain includes $A$, the image collection $F[A] = \\{F(x) : x \\in A\\}$ is a set. This axiom is more powerful because it can create new sets without needing a pre-existing container set. It guarantees that the \"size\" of the image collection is not an obstacle, as long as the domain is a set.\n\nThe task is to find an example where the elements of the image $F[X]$ have ranks or sizes that grow in such a way that no single set, constructible with the ZF axioms minus Replacement, can contain all of them.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Let $X = \\omega$ and define $F(n) = \\mathcal{P}^{n}(\\emptyset)$, where $\\mathcal{P}^{0}(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$ and $\\mathcal{P}^{n+1}(\\emptyset) = \\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}^{n}(\\emptyset))$. Then $F$ is definable and functional on $X$. The collection $F[X] = \\{\\mathcal{P}^{n}(\\emptyset) : n \\in \\omega\\}$ is not a subset of any previously given set by the basic axioms, so the Axiom Schema of Separation cannot be applied to produce it. The Axiom Schema of Replacement is needed to ensure that the image $F[\\omega]$ is a set.**\n\n- **Analysis:** The function $F(n) = \\mathcal{P}^n(\\emptyset)$ is definable by recursion, which is formalizable in ZF. The domain is $X = \\omega$, which is a set by the Axiom of Infinity. The image is $F[\\omega] = \\{\\emptyset, \\mathcal{P}(\\emptyset), \\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(\\emptyset)), \\dots\\}$.\n- Let's consider the ranks of the elements in the image. The rank of a set is a measure of its complexity. We have $\\text{rank}(\\emptyset) = 0$ and $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{P}(S)) = \\text{rank}(S) + 1$. Thus, $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{P}^n(\\emptyset)) = n$. The set of ranks of the elements in $F[\\omega]$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\} = \\omega$.\n- For $F[\\omega]$ to be a subset of some set $Y$, all its elements must have ranks less than $\\text{rank}(Y)$. However, the ranks of the elements of $F[\\omega]$ are unbounded. In the theory ZF without Replacement (let's call it ZF-R), there is no axiom that guarantees the existence of a set $Y$ that could contain all sets $\\mathcal{P}^n(\\emptyset)$ for $n \\in \\omega$. Consequently, the Axiom Schema of Separation cannot be applied, as there is no initial \"container\" set.\n- The Axiom Schema of Replacement, however, applies directly. Since $F$ is a definable function and $\\omega$ is a set, $F[\\omega]$ is a set.\n- The explanation provided in the option is entirely correct.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Let $X = \\omega$ and define $F(n) = n + 1$. Then $F$ is definable and functional and $F[X] \\subseteq \\omega$. Therefore the Axiom Schema of Separation suffices to produce $F[X]$ as a subset of $\\omega$, and the Axiom Schema of Replacement is not needed.**\n\n- **Analysis:** The function is $F(n) = n+1$ on the domain $X = \\omega$. The image is $F[\\omega] = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. This image is clearly a subset of $\\omega = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. The Axiom of Infinity guarantees that $\\omega$ is a set. We can use the Axiom Schema of Separation on the set $\\omega$ with the property $\\psi(z) := z \\neq 0$. This gives the set $\\{z \\in \\omega : z \\neq 0\\}$, which is precisely $F[\\omega]$.\n- The option correctly states that Separation is sufficient and Replacement is not needed. Therefore, this is not an example of the type requested by the problem.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Let $X$ be any set and define $F(x) = \\{x\\}$. Then $F$ is definable and functional and $F[X] \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(X)$. Therefore the Axiom Schema of Separation suffices to produce $F[X]$ as a subset of $\\mathcal{P}(X)$, and the Axiom Schema of Replacement is not needed.**\n\n- **Analysis:** The function is $F(x) = \\{x\\}$ on a domain set $X$. The image is $F[X] = \\{\\{x\\} : x \\in X\\}$. For any element $x \\in X$, the singleton set $\\{x\\}$ is a subset of $X$. By definition, any subset of $X$ is an element of the power set of $X$, denoted $\\mathcal{P}(X)$. Therefore, for all $x \\in X$, we have $\\{x\\} \\in \\mathcal{P}(X)$. This implies $F[X] \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(X)$.\n- By the Axiom of Power Set, $\\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a set. We can then apply the Axiom Schema of Separation to $\\mathcal{P}(X)$ to form the set $F[X]$.\n- The option correctly states that Separation is sufficient. This is not the example requested.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Let $X = \\omega$ and define $F(n) = V_{n}$, where $V_{0} = \\emptyset$ and $V_{n+1} = \\mathcal{P}(V_{n})$.

The collection $F[X] = \\{V_{n} : n \\in \\omega\\}$ is not provably a subset of any previously given set by the basic axioms alone, so the Axiom Schema of Separation cannot be applied to produce it. The Axiom Schema of Replacement is needed to ensure that the image $F[\\omega]$ is a set.**\n\n- **Analysis:** The definition given for $V_n$ is recursive: $V_0 = \\emptyset$ and $V_{n+1} = \\mathcal{P}(V_n)$. This is the standard construction of the finite levels of the von Neumann hierarchy.\n- Let us compare this to Option A. Option A defines $A_n = \\mathcal{P}^n(\\emptyset)$ with $A_0 = \\emptyset$ and $A_{n+1} = \\mathcal{P}(A_n)$. The definitions are identical. Thus, the function and the image set in this option are the same as in Option A.\n- $F[\\omega] = \\{V_0, V_1, V_2, \\dots\\} = \\{\\emptyset, \\mathcal{P}(\\emptyset), \\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(\\emptyset)), \\dots\\}$.\n- As analyzed for Option A, the ranks of the sets $V_n$ are unbounded. This prevents the construction of a containing set without the Axiom of Replacement. Replacement is necessary and sufficient to prove $F[\\omega]$ is a set. The explanation given is correct. In fact, the existence of the set $\\{V_n : n \\in \\omega\\}$ allows one to construct $V_\\omega = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\omega} V_n$, and it is a classic result that the existence of $V_\\omega$ is not provable in ZF without Replacement.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**E. Let $X = \\omega$ and define $F(n)$ to be the set ${}^{n}n$ of all functions from $n$ to $n$. Then $F$ is definable and functional. The collection $F[X]$ is a subset of $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(\\omega \\times \\omega))$, so the Axiom Schema of Separation suffices to produce $F[X]$ as a set, and the Axiom Schema of Replacement is not needed.**\n\n- **Analysis:** The domain is $X = \\omega$. We use the standard set-theoretic definition of natural numbers where $n = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. A function $f: n \\to n$ is a set of ordered pairs, so $f \\subseteq n \\times n$. The set of all such functions is ${}^n n$. Thus, ${}^n n \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(n \\times n)$.\n- Since $n \\in \\omega$, we have $n \\subseteq \\omega$. This implies $n \\times n \\subseteq \\omega \\times \\omega$.\n- If $A \\subseteq B$, then $\\mathcal{P}(A) \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(B)$. So, $\\mathcal{P}(n \\times n) \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(\\omega \\times \\omega)$.\n- Combining these facts, ${}^n n \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(n \\times n) \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(\\omega \\times \\omega)$. This means that the set ${}^n n$ is an element of the power set of $\\mathcal{P}(\\omega \\times \\omega)$, i.e., ${}^n n \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(\\omega \\times \\omega))$.\n- This holds for all $n \\in \\omega$. Therefore, the entire image set $F[\\omega] = \\{{}^n n : n \\in \\omega\\}$ is a subset of $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(\\omega \\times \\omega))$.\n- The set $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(\\omega \\times \\omega))$ can be constructed in ZF-R: $\\omega$ exists by Infinity, $\\omega \\times \\omega$ can be constructed, and the Power Set axiom can be applied twice.\n- Since we have found a container set, Separation is sufficient to form $F[\\omega]$. The option's reasoning is correct. This is not an example of the required type.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions A and D both present a correct example and a correct justification.
