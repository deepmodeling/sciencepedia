The Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder (CBS) theorem states that if $|A| \\le |B|$ and $|B| \\le |A|$, then $|A| = |B|$. In the language of ordered relations, this means that $\\le$ is antisymmetric (when we identify sets with the same cardinality). The relation $\\le$ is also reflexive ($|A| \\le |A|$ via the identity map) and transitive (if $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to C$ are injections, then $g \\circ f: A \\to C$ is an injection, so $|A| \\le |B|$ and $|B| \\le |C|$ implies $|A| \\le |C|$).\n\nFor cardinalities to be \"comparable\" in the usual sense of a linear or total order, the relation $\\le$ must be total, meaning for any two sets $A$ and $B$, we must have either $|A| \\le |B|$ or $|B| \\le |A|$. This property is known as the Law of Trichotomy for cardinals. This law is not a theorem of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF). Its truth is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice (AC). Therefore, within ZF alone, one cannot be certain that any two cardinals are comparable. The CBS theorem only provides a conclusion ($|A| = |B|$) when the premise (injections in both directions) is met; it does not guarantee that the premise for comparability (an injection in at least one direction) is ever met for arbitrary sets $A$ and $B$.\n\nWith this foundation, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In ZF, for all sets $A$ and $B$, either $|A| \\le |B|$ or $|B| \\le |A|$. Therefore, CBS suffices to compare arbitrary cardinals.**\nThis statement's premise is factually incorrect. The assertion \"for all sets $A$ and $B$, either $|A| \\le |B|$ or $|B| \\le |A|$\" is the Law of Trichotomy for cardinal numbers. This principle is not provable in ZF set theory. In fact, it is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice (AC). As the premise is false, the conclusion derived from it is unsound.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Assuming AC, every set can be well-ordered, hence any two cardinals are comparable. Equivalently, for any sets $A$ and $B$, either there is an injection $A \\to B$ or an injection $B \\to A$, so combined with CBS, cardinalities are linearly ordered.**\nThis statement is entirely correct. The Axiom of Choice (AC) is equivalent to the Well-Ordering Theorem, which asserts that any set can be endowed with a well-ordering. For any two well-ordered sets, one must be order-isomorphic to an initial segment of the other. This implies the existence of an order-preserving injection from one into the other. Consequently, for any two sets $A$ and $B$, assuming AC, there exists an injection in at least one direction, meaning either $|A| \\le |B|$ or $|B| \\le |A|$. This establishes that the relation $\\le$ on cardinals is total. When combined with reflexivity, transitivity, and the antisymmetry guaranteed by CBS, it confirms that cardinalities are linearly ordered under the assumption of AC (i.e., in ZFC).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Without AC, there are models in which there exist infinite sets $A$ and $B$ such that neither $|A| \\le |B|$ nor $|B| \\le |A|$, so CBS cannot be used to decide which of $|A|$ and $|B|$ is larger.**\nThis statement is correct. It is a fundamental result in modern set theory, established by Paul Cohen, that if ZF is consistent, then so is ZF + $\\neg$AC. In models of ZF + $\\neg$AC, it is possible for there to exist sets $A$ and $B$ (so-called \"incomparable cardinals\") for which there is no injection $A \\to B$ and no injection $B \\to A$. In such a scenario, the condition for comparability is not met. The CBS theorem is irrelevant to this pair of sets, as its hypothesis ($|A| \\le |B|$ and $|B| \\le |A|$) is not satisfied, and there is no basis to establish any ordering between $|A|$ and $|B|$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D.

Cantor's theorem demonstrates that for any set $A$, its power set $\\mathcal{P}(A)$ has a strictly greater cardinality. This is a powerful result for generating an infinite hierarchy of larger and larger cardinals (e.g., $|\\mathbb{N}|  |\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})|  |\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N}))|  \\dots$). However, it provides no information about the comparability of two *arbitrary* sets, $A$ and $B$, which may not be related through the power set operation. The combination of Cantor's theorem and CBS does not suffice to prove the Law of Trichotomy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In ZF, every surjection $B \\twoheadrightarrow A$ yields an injection $A \\hookrightarrow B$, so CBS can be applied using surjections in place of injections to compare cardinals.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The assertion that for every surjection $f: B \\to A$ there exists an injection $g: A \\to B$ is a well-known equivalent of the Axiom of Choice. To construct such an injection $g$, one must, for each element $a \\in A$, choose exactly one element from its non-empty preimage set $f^{-1}(\\{a\\})$. Performing this simultaneous selection for all $a \\in A$ requires AC if $A$ is infinite. Thus, this principle is not available in ZF alone.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. The Continuum Hypothesis by itself does not guarantee that for arbitrary $A$ and $B$ one of $|A| \\le |B|$ or $|B| \\le |A|$ holds, so without AC, CBS still does not compare arbitrary cardinals even if CH is assumed.**\nThis statement is correct. The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is a specific claim about the cardinality of the continuum: it asserts there is no cardinal number strictly between $|\\mathbb{N}|$ (the cardinality of the natural numbers) and $|\\mathbb{R}| = |\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})|$ (the cardinality of the real numbers). This is a statement about a particular \"gap\" in the hierarchy of infinite cardinals. It is not a general principle about the structure of the class of all cardinals. It is known that CH does not imply AC. Therefore, one can have models of set theory that satisfy ZF + CH + $\\neg$AC.

There exists an injective function $f:A \\to B$. This is the definition of $|A| \\le |B|$.\n$2$. There exists a surjective function $g:B \\to A$.\n\nLet's analyze the implications between these two statements within ZF and ZFC (ZF + AC).\n\n**Implication 1: `Surjection implies Injection`**\nIf there exists a surjective function $g:B \\to A$, does there exist an injective function $f:A \\to B$?\nTo construct such an $f$, for each $a \\in A$, we must choose an element from the non-empty preimage set $g^{-1}(a)=\\{b \\in B \\mid g(b)=a\\}$. Let's define $f(a)$ to be this chosen element. For $f$ to be a function, we must make one such choice for every $a \\in A$. The Axiom of Choice (AC) guarantees the existence of a \"choice function\" that performs this selection simultaneously for all $a \\in A$. The resulting function $f$ is injective because if $a_1 \\neq a_2$, their preimages $g^{-1}(a_1)$ and $g^{-1}(a_2)$ are disjoint, so the chosen elements must be distinct.\nThus, the implication $(\\exists g: B \\to A \\text{ surjective}) \\implies (\\exists f: A \\to B \\text{ injective})$ is provable in ZFC. Without AC, this implication is not generally true. In fact, this implication is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice.\n\n**Implication 2: `Injection implies Surjection`**\nIf there exists an injective function $f:A \\to B$, does there exist a surjective function $g:B \\to A$?\nLet $f:A \\to B$ be an injection. Let $A' = f(A)$ be the image of $A$ in $B$. Since $f$ is an injection, it defines a bijection between $A$ and $A'$, so its inverse $f^{-1}:A' \\to A$ is well-defined. We can define a function $g:B \\to A$ as follows:\n$$ g(b) = \\begin{cases} f^{-1}(b)  \\text{if } b \\in A' \\\\ a_0  \\text{if } b \\in B \\setminus A' \\end{cases} $$\nFor this definition to be valid, we need to be able to pick an element $a_0 \\in A$. This is only possible if $A$ is non-empty. If $A \\neq \\varnothing$, we can pick such an $a_0$, and the function $g$ is well-defined. This function $g$ is surjective because for any $a \\in A$, the element $f(a) \\in A'$, and $g(f(a)) = f^{-1}(f(a)) = a$. This construction does not use the Axiom of Choice.\nTherefore, the implication $(\\exists f: A \\to B \\text{ injective}) \\implies (\\exists g: B \\to A \\text{ surjective})$ is provable in ZF, provided $A \\neq \\varnothing$.\nIf $A = \\varnothing$, then an injection $f:\\varnothing \\to B$ exists for any set $B$ (the empty function). However, a surjection $g:B \\to \\varnothing$ exists only if $B = \\varnothing$. If $B$ is non-empty, no function from $B$ to $\\varnothing$ can exist.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) without the Axiom of Choice (AC), for all sets $A$ and $B$, $|A|\\le |B|$ if and only if there exists a surjection $g:B\\to A$.**\n\nThis statement claims the equivalence $|A|\\le |B| \\iff \\exists g:B \\to A \\text{ surjective}$ holds in ZF for all sets $A$ and $B$.\nLet's check both directions.\n$(\\Leftarrow)$: $\\exists g:B \\to A \\text{ surjective} \\implies |A|\\le |B|$. As discussed, proving this requires the Axiom of Choice. It is known to be unprovable in ZF alone.\n$(\\Rightarrow)$: $|A|\\le |B| \\implies \\exists g:B \\to A \\text{ surjective}$. As discussed, this fails if $A=\\varnothing$ and $B \\neq \\varnothing$. For example, let $A=\\varnothing$ and $B=\\{1\\}$. Then $|A|=0 \\le |B|=1$, so an injection from $A$ to $B$ exists. But there is no function from $B$ to $A$, let alone a surjection.\nSince the equivalence fails in both directions for certain cases in ZF, the statement is false.\n\nVerdict on A: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF), if $A\\neq \\varnothing$ and there exists an injection $f:A\\to B$, then there exists a surjection $g:B\\to A$.**\n\nThis is precisely the second implication analyzed above, with the crucial condition $A \\neq \\varnothing$ included. As demonstrated, we can construct the surjective function $g:B \\to A$ within ZF. The construction relies on being able to pick a single element $a_0 \\in A$ (which is possible since $A$ is non-empty) to map all elements of $B$ that are not in the image of $f$. This does not require the Axiom of Choice.\n\nVerdict on B: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The schema “for all sets $A,B$, if there exists a surjection $g:B\\to A$ then there exists an injection $f:A\\to B$” is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice (AC).**\n\nThis statement asserts that AC is equivalent to the proposition $P: \\forall A,B ((\\exists g:B \\to A \\text{ surjective}) \\implies (\\exists f:A \\to B \\text{ injective}))$. This is a standard result in axiomatic set theory.\n- **AC $\\implies P$**: This is the easy direction. Assuming AC, we can form the family of non-empty sets $\\{g^{-1}(a)\\}_{a \\in A}$. AC guarantees the existence of a choice function that selects one element from each set. This selection process defines an injective function from $A$ to $B$.\n- **$P \\implies$ AC**: This is a more advanced result, first proven by A. C. Diaconescu in $1982$. It shows that assuming this principle allows one to prove the Axiom of Choice within ZF.\n\nTherefore, the schema described is indeed equivalent to the Axiom of Choice over ZF.\n\nVerdict on C: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Cantor’s theorem implies that for every set $A$, there is no surjection $h:A\\to \\mathcal{P}(A)$; consequently, by the injection-based definition of cardinal comparison, $|A||\\mathcal{P}(A)|$.**\n\nLet's break down this compound statement.\n$1$. \"Cantor’s theorem implies that for every set $A$, there is no surjection $h:A\\to \\mathcal{P}(A)$\". This is the standard statement of Cantor's theorem, proven by a diagonalization argument. This part is correct.\n$2$. \"...consequently... $|A||\\mathcal{P}(A)|$\". The notation $|A||\\mathcal{P}(A)|$ means $|A| \\le |\\mathcal{P}(A)|$ and $|A| \\neq |\\mathcal{P}(A)|$.\n- Does $|A| \\le |\\mathcal{P}(A)|$ hold? Yes, the function $f:A \\to \\mathcal{P}(A)$ defined by $f(a) = \\{a\\}$ is an injection. This is provable in ZF.\n- Does $|A| \\neq |\\mathcal{P}(A)|$ hold? By definition, $|A| = |\\mathcal{P}(A)|$ means there exists a bijection between $A$ and $\\mathcal{P}(A)$. A bijection is, in particular, a surjection. Since Cantor's theorem shows there is no surjection from $A$ to $\\mathcal{P}(A)$, there cannot be a bijection. Therefore, $|A| \\neq |\\mathcal{P}(A)|$.\nThe logic presented is that the lack of a surjection from $A$ to $\\mathcal{P}(A)$ leads to the conclusion $|A||\\mathcal{P}(A)|$. This reasoning is sound and holds within ZF. The \"consequently\" is justified.\n\nVerdict on D: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Assuming the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), the equivalence between “$|A|\\le |B|$” and “there exists a surjection $g:B\\to A$” holds for all sets $A,B$.**\n\nThe equivalence in question is $|A|\\le |B| \\iff \\exists g:B \\to A \\text{ surjective}$.\nAs noted in the analysis of option A, this equivalence fails for $A=\\varnothing, B\\neq\\varnothing$, regardless of any additional axioms like CH.\nEven if we restrict the statement to non-empty sets $A, B$, the equivalence is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice. The question then becomes: does CH imply AC?\nCH is the statement $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_1$. It is a famous result in set theory (by Gödel and Cohen) that CH is independent of ZFC (ZF+AC). It is also known (from work by Feferman and Levy) that CH is consistent with the negation of AC. That is, the system ZF + CH + $\\neg$AC is consistent (if ZF is). Therefore, CH does not imply AC.\nSince the equivalence is equivalent to AC, and CH does not imply AC, assuming CH is not sufficient to prove the equivalence holds for all sets.\n\nVerdict on E: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCD}$$", "id": "3038131"}, {"introduction": "The Axiom of Choice is so foundational to modern mathematics that it can be difficult to imagine a universe where it fails.

Specifically, we will analyze the concept of Dedekind-finiteness and amorphous sets, using the described Fraenkel-Mostowski model as a guide.\n\nFirst, let us clarify the definitions. In $\\mathsf{ZF}$ set theory, a set is called finite if it can be put into a bijection with a natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. A set is infinite if it is not finite. A set $X$ is Dedekind-infinite if there is an injection $f: X \\to X$ such that $f(X)$ is a proper subset of $X$, denoted $f(X) \\subsetneq X$. A set is Dedekind-finite if it is not Dedekind-infinite. In $\\mathsf{ZFC}$ (that is, $\\mathsf{ZF}$ with $\\mathsf{AC}$), the notions of \"infinite\" and \"Dedekind-infinite\" are equivalent. However, without $\\mathsf{AC}$, this equivalence fails. There can exist sets that are infinite but Dedekind-finite. The model described in the problem is a canonical example of a setting where such sets exist.\n\nLet's proceed with an option-by-option analysis.\n\n**A. In $\\mathsf{ZF}$ there is a model in which an infinite set $A$ exists but $A$ is Dedekind-finite; such a model can be obtained by taking the symmetric submodel $M$ of a $\\mathsf{ZFA}$ universe built from permutations of an infinite set of atoms and the normal filter generated by pointwise stabilizers of finite supports.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The construction described is the first Fraenkel model. In this model, the set of atoms $A$ is infinite by construction. As will be shown in the analysis of option C, this set $A$ is Dedekind-finite within the symmetric submodel $M$. This provides a model of $\\mathsf{ZFA}$ (set theory with atoms) where an infinite, Dedekind-finite set exists. The statement asserts the existence of such a model for $\\mathsf{ZF}$ (standard set theory without atoms). This is also true due to transfer theorems, most notably the Jech-Sochor embedding theorem. This theorem shows that consistency results obtained in $\\mathsf{ZFA}$ via permutation models can be transferred to $\\mathsf{ZF}$ via forcing, proving the consistency of corresponding statements with $\\mathsf{ZF}$. Therefore, since it is consistent with $\\mathsf{ZFA}$ to have an infinite, Dedekind-finite set, it is also consistent with $\\mathsf{ZF}$. The statement correctly identifies the method that originally established this consistency result.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. By Cantor’s theorem $|\\mathcal{P}(X)||X|$, so every infinite set $X$ in $\\mathsf{ZF}$ must be Dedekind-infinite; therefore the failure of $\\mathsf{AC}$ is irrelevant to Dedekind-finiteness.**\n\nThis statement contains a logical flaw. Cantor's theorem states that there is no surjection from a set $X$ to its power set $\\mathcal{P}(X)$. While this establishes a fundamental hierarchy of cardinalities, it does not, in itself, provide a method to construct an injection from an infinite set $X$ to a proper subset of itself. The proof that every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite relies on the Axiom of Countable Choice ($\\mathsf{AC}_\\omega$), a weak form of $\\mathsf{AC}$. Specifically, to show an infinite set $X$ is Dedekind-infinite, one first needs to find a countably infinite subset $S \\subseteq X$. The existence of such a subset for any infinite $X$ is not provable in $\\mathsf{ZF}$ alone. Once such a subset $S = \\{s_0, s_1, s_2, \\dots \\}$ is found, one can define the required injection $f: X \\to X$, but the first step requires choice. Thus, the conclusion that the failure of $\\mathsf{AC}$ is irrelevant is incorrect; it is precisely the failure of choice principles that allows for the existence of infinite, Dedekind-finite sets.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In the symmetric model $M$ described, the set of atoms $A$ is amorphous: for any $B\\subseteq A$ with $B\\in M$, either $B$ is finite or $A\\setminus B$ is finite; consequently $A$ has no countably infinite subset and is Dedekind-finite despite being infinite.**\n\nThis statement is a correct and detailed analysis of the properties of the set of atoms $A$ in the described model.\n1.  **$A$ is amorphous in $M$**: Let $B$ be a subset of $A$ in the model $M$. By the properties of the Fraenkel-Mostowski construction, $B$ must have a finite support, say $E \\subset A$. This means that for any permutation $\\pi$ of $A$ that fixes every element of $E$ (i.e., $\\pi(e)=e$ for all $e \\in E$), we must have $\\pi(B) = B$. Consider any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A \\setminus E$. The transposition $\\pi = (a_1 \\ a_2)$ is a permutation of $A$ that fixes $E$ pointwise. Therefore, $\\pi(B) = B$. This implies that $a_1 \\in B$ if and only if $\\pi(a_1) = a_2 \\in B$. This holds for any pair of elements outside the support $E$. Consequently, either all elements of $A \\setminus E$ are in $B$, or none of them are.\n    *   Case 1: $(A \\setminus E) \\subseteq B$. Then $A \\setminus B \\subseteq E$. Since $E$ is finite, $A \\setminus B$ is finite, so $B$ is cofinite.\n    *   Case 2: $(A \\setminus E) \\cap B = \\emptyset$. Then $B \\subseteq E$. Since $E$ is finite, $B$ is finite.\n    Thus, any subset of $A$ in $M$ is either finite or cofinite. Since $A$ itself is infinite, this is the definition of an amorphous set.\n2.  **Amorphous $\\implies$ no countably infinite subset**: Suppose, for contradiction, that $A$ has a countably infinite subset $S \\in M$. Then $S$ is an infinite subset, so by the amorphous property, its complement $A \\setminus S$ must be finite. But this is impossible: $A$ is infinite, and removing a finite number of elements from an infinite set leaves an infinite set. So $A \\setminus S$ must be infinite. This contradicts the amorphous property, as we have found a subset $S$ which is neither finite nor cofinite. Therefore, $A$ cannot have a countably infinite subset in $M$.\n3.  **No countably infinite subset $\\implies$ Dedekind-finite**: Suppose, for contradiction, that $A$ is Dedekind-infinite. Then there exists an injection $f: A \\to A$ with $f(A) \\subsetneq A$. Let $a_0 \\in A \\setminus f(A)$. We can define a sequence by recursion: $a_{n+1} = f(a_n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Since $f$ is an injection and $a_0$ is not in the image of $f$, all elements of the sequence $\\{a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots \\}$ are distinct. This sequence forms a countably infinite subset of $A$. This contradicts our derived property that $A$ has no countably infinite subset. Therefore, $A$ must be Dedekind-finite.\n\nThe statement provides a complete and correct chain of reasoning.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. The existence of an amorphous set in such a symmetric model settles the Continuum Hypothesis by forcing $2^{\\aleph_0}=\\aleph_1$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The Continuum Hypothesis ($\\mathsf{CH}$) is a statement about the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers, which are well-ordered sets. It posits that there is no cardinal number strictly between $\\aleph_0$ (the cardinality of the natural numbers) and $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum). The existence of \"pathological\" sets like amorphous sets, which are not well-orderable, is a feature of models where $\\mathsf{AC}$ fails. However, the truth or falsity of $\\mathsf{CH}$ is independent of $\\mathsf{ZF} + \\neg \\mathsf{AC}$. One can construct models of set theory that contain amorphous sets and in which $\\mathsf{CH}$ is true, and other models that contain amorphous sets and in which $\\mathsf{CH}$ is false. The construction of an amorphous set does not settle the continuum problem one way or the other. Also, forcing is a different technique from the permutation model construction described, although the two are related via transfer theorems.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The Axiom of Choice implies that every infinite set $X$ admits an injection $f:X\\to X$ with $f(X)\\subsetneq X$ (for example, by well-ordering $X$ and shifting the first $\\omega$-many elements), so every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite; hence the existence of an amorphous set in a model demonstrates the failure of $\\mathsf{AC}$ in that model.**\n\nThis statement is correct.\n1.  **$\\mathsf{AC} \\implies$ Every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite**: The Axiom of Choice implies the Axiom of Countable Choice ($\\mathsf{AC}_\\omega$), which states that any countably infinite collection of non-empty sets has a choice function. For any infinite set $X$, $\\mathsf{AC}_\\omega$ is sufficient to prove that $X$ has a countably infinite subset, let's call it $S = \\{s_0, s_1, s_2, \\dots \\}$. We can then define an injection $f: X \\to X$ as follows:\n    *   $f(x) = s_{i+1}$ if $x = s_i \\in S$.\n    *   $f(x) = x$ if $x \\in X \\setminus S$.\n    This function is an injection, and its image is $f(X) = (X \\setminus S) \\cup \\{s_1, s_2, \\dots\\} = X \\setminus \\{s_0\\}$. Since $s_0 \\in X$ but $s_0 \\notin f(X)$, the image $f(X)$ is a proper subset of $X$. Therefore, $X$ is Dedekind-infinite.\n2.  **Existence of amorphous set $\\implies \\neg\\mathsf{AC}$**: An amorphous set is, by definition, an infinite set. As established in the analysis of option C, an amorphous set is also Dedekind-finite. Therefore, an amorphous set is an example of an infinite, Dedekind-finite set. From the first part of this analysis, we know that in any model satisfying $\\mathsf{AC}$, no such set can exist. The existence of an amorphous set in a model is therefore a direct contradiction to the consequences of $\\mathsf{AC}$. Thus, any model containing an amorphous set must be a model where $\\mathsf{AC}$ fails. The reasoning is sound.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "3038152"}]}
