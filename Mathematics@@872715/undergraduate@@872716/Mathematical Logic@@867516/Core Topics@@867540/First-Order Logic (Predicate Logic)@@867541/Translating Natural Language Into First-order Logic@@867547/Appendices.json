Compute $N$ and provide it as an exact integer. No rounding is required.", "solution": "We start from the core semantics of first-order logic quantifiers. The universal quantifier $\\forall x$ expresses that a property holds for every element $x$ in the domain, and the existential quantifier $\\exists y$ expresses that there is at least one element $y$ in the domain satisfying a given property. In a single-sorted setting with a domain including both students and non-students, a natural language restriction such as \"for all students\" is represented by universally quantifying over the entire domain and placing the restriction $S(x)$ into the antecedent of an implication. This adheres to the standard method of representing restricted quantification: \"for all $x$ such that $S(x)$\" becomes $\\forall x\\,(S(x) \\rightarrow \\dots)$, ensuring that the consequent need only hold for those $x$ that satisfy $S(x)$.\n\nThe sentence \"for all students there exists a course they like\" asserts a dependency of a course on each student: for each student $x$, there should exist at least one course $y$ such that $y$ is a course and $x$ likes $y$. This dependency is captured by placing $\\exists y$ within the scope of the universal quantifier $\\forall x$, ensuring that the chosen $y$ may vary with $x$. Therefore the high-level scopal structure is $\\forall x \\,(\\text{if } S(x) \\text{ then } \\exists y\\,\\Phi(x,y))$ for an appropriate $\\Phi(x,y)$.\n\nThe internal content $\\Phi(x,y)$ must express that $y$ is a course and that $x$ likes $y$. Conjunctive linkage is appropriate because both properties must hold of the same $y$. Thus we use $C(y) \\land L(x,y)$. Putting these components together yields the closed sentence:\n$$\n\\forall x \\bigl(S(x) \\rightarrow \\exists y \\bigl(C(y) \\land L(x,y)\\bigr)\\bigr).\n$$\n\nWe briefly justify the binding and scopal decisions:\n\n- The variable $x$ is bound by the outermost universal quantifier $\\forall x$, reflecting \"for all students\" as a restriction over the full domain using the implication antecedent $S(x)$. This avoids incorrectly asserting that every domain element is a student; for instance, the form $\\forall x\\,(S(x) \\land \\dots)$ would require every element to be a student, which is stronger than intended.\n\n- The variable $y$ is bound by the existential quantifier $\\exists y$ that lies within the scope of $\\forall x$. This expresses that the choice of course $y$ may depend on which student $x$ is under consideration, matching the intended dependency.\n\n- The conjunct $C(y) \\land L(x,y)$ ensures that the same $y$ is both a course and liked by the particular $x$ in context.\n\nNow we compute $N$ as defined. The final sentence is:\n$$\n\\forall x \\bigl(S(x) \\rightarrow \\exists y \\bigl(C(y) \\land L(x,y)\\bigr)\\bigr).\n$$\nWe identify the atomic formulas within this sentence:\n- $S(x)$,\n- $C(y)$,\n- $L(x,y)$.\n\nWe count occurrences of each bound variable symbol within these atomic formulas:\n\n- For $x$ (bound by $\\forall x$): $x$ appears in $S(x)$ once and in $L(x,y)$ once, for a total of $2$ occurrences.\n\n- For $y$ (bound by $\\exists y$): $y$ appears in $C(y)$ once and in $L(x,y)$ once, for a total of $2$ occurrences.\n\nBy definition, $N$ is the product of these counts, so\n$$\nN \\;=\\; 2 \\times 2 \\;=\\; 4.\n$$\nTherefore, the exact integer value of $N$ is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3058358"}, {"introduction": "Unlike the precise language of logic, natural language is often ambiguous. This practice explores one of the most famous examples of ambiguity: quantifier scope. The sentence \"All the students read a book\" can mean two very different things, and first-order logic provides the tools to distinguish them precisely. This exercise challenges you not only to formulate both interpretations but also to analyze the logical relationship between them, demonstrating how one reading is logically stronger than the other [@problem_id:3058338].", "problem": "Consider a single-sorted First-Order Logic (FOL) language with domain of discourse $D$.

Using only the standard quantifiers $\\forall$ and $\\exists$, construct two FOL formulas that capture the two scopal readings of the sentence: one in which there is a single shared book read by all students, and another in which each student may have read a (possibly different) book. Your constructions must respect the following principles: the syntax and semantics of quantifiers must be those of standard Tarskian model theory; variable bindings must be correct; and the predicates $S$, $B$, and $R$ must be used explicitly to constrain the domain to students, books, and the reading relation, respectively. Then, using the standard semantics of the quantifiers, justify that one of your formulas logically implies the other, and rigorously demonstrate they are not logically equivalent by providing a finite structure that makes the weaker reading true while falsifying the stronger reading.

We will construct two formulas representing the two possible readings.\n\n**1. Formulation of the Two Scopal Readings**\n\nThe two readings depend on whether the existential quantifier for \"a book\" takes wide scope over the universal quantifier for \"all students\", or narrow scope within it.\n\n**Reading 1 (Wide scope existential):** There exists a single book that is read by every student.\nThis reading gives the existential quantifier $\\exists y$ wide scope. The structure is: \"There exists a $y$ such that $y$ is a book, AND for all $x$, if $x$ is a student, then $x$ reads $y$.\" The correct formalization uses a conjunction with the existential quantifier to assert the existence of an object with the desired properties, and an implication with the universal quantifier to restrict its domain to students.\n\nLet this formula be $\\Phi_1$:\n$$ \\Phi_1 \\equiv \\exists y (B(y) \\land \\forall x (S(x) \\rightarrow R(x, y))) $$\n\n**Reading 2 (Narrow scope existential):** For each student, there exists some book that they read. The book may be different for each student.\nThis reading gives the universal quantifier $\\forall x$ wide scope. The structure is: \"For all $x$, if $x$ is a student, THEN there exists a $y$ such that $y$ is a book AND $x$ reads $y$.\"\n\nLet this formula be $\\Phi_2$:\n$$ \\Phi_2 \\equiv \\forall x (S(x) \\rightarrow \\exists y (B(y) \\land R(x, y))) $$\n\n**2. Logical Implication**\n\nWe will now demonstrate that $\\Phi_1$ logically implies $\\Phi_2$. That is, $\\Phi_1 \\models \\Phi_2$. We must show that any model that satisfies $\\Phi_1$ also satisfies $\\Phi_2$.\n\nAssume an arbitrary structure $\\mathcal{M} = (D, I)$ satisfies $\\Phi_1$. By the semantics of FOL, this means:\n$$ \\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists y (B(y) \\land \\forall x (S(x) \\rightarrow R(x, y))) $$\nThis implies there exists an element $b \\in D$ such that the formula inside the existential quantifier is true when $y$ is assigned $b$. So, for this specific $b \\in D$, two conditions hold:\n(i) $b$ is in the extension of $B$, i.e., $B^{\\mathcal{M}}(b)$ is true.\n(ii) $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x (S(x) \\rightarrow R(x, b))$. This means for any element $a \\in D$, if $S^{\\mathcal{M}}(a)$ is true, then $R^{\\mathcal{M}}(a, b)$ is true.\n\nNow, we must show that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Phi_2$, which is $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x (S(x) \\rightarrow \\exists y (B(y) \\land R(x, y)))$.\nTo prove this universal statement, we take an arbitrary element $a \\in D$. We must show that $\\mathcal{M} \\models S(a) \\rightarrow \\exists y (B(y) \\land R(a, y))$.\nTo prove this implication, we assume its antecedent is true: assume $S^{\\mathcal{M}}(a)$ is true.\nNow we must prove the consequent: $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists y (B(y) \\land R(a, y))$.\nTo prove this existential statement, we must find a \"witness\" element in $D$. Let us propose the element $b$ from our initial assumption as the witness. We must check if it satisfies the condition $B(b) \\land R(a, b)$.\n- From assumption (i), we have that $B^{\\mathcal{M}}(b)$ is true.\n- From assumption (ii), since we assumed $S^{\\mathcal{M}}(a)$ is true for our chosen $a$, it follows that $R^{\\mathcal{M}}(a, b)$ must also be true.\nBoth parts of the conjunction $B(b) \\land R(a, b)$ are true. Therefore, the existential statement $\\exists y (B(y) \\land R(a, y))$ is true for our chosen $a$.\nSince we assumed $S^{\\mathcal{M}}(a)$ and showed the consequent is true, the implication $S(a) \\rightarrow \\exists y (B(y) \\land R(a, y))$ holds for the arbitrary element $a$.\nAs $a$ was arbitrary, the universal statement $\\forall x (S(x) \\rightarrow \\exists y (B(y) \\land R(x, y)))$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$.\nThus, we have shown that if $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Phi_1$, then $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Phi_2$. The implication $\\Phi_1 \\models \\Phi_2$ holds. $\\Phi_1$ is the stronger reading.\n\n**3. Non-Equivalence and Countermodel**\n\nTo demonstrate that the formulas are not logically equivalent, we must show that the reverse implication $\\Phi_2 \\models \\Phi_1$ does not hold. We do this by constructing a finite countermodel $\\mathcal{M}$ in which $\\Phi_2$ is true and $\\Phi_1$ is false.\n\nLet the structure $\\mathcal{M}$ be defined as follows:\n- Domain of discourse: $D = \\{s_1, s_2, b_1, b_2\\}$\n- Interpretation of predicates:\n  - $S^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{s_1, s_2\\}$ (There are two students, $s_1$ and $s_2$)\n  - $B^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{b_1, b_2\\}$ (There are two books, $b_1$ and $b_2$)\n  - $R^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{(s_1, b_1), (s_2, b_2)\\}$ ($s_1$ reads $b_1$, and $s_2$ reads $b_2$)\n\nNow we evaluate $\\Phi_1$ and $\\Phi_2$ in this model $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\n- **Evaluation of $\\Phi_2 \\equiv \\forall x (S(x) \\rightarrow \\exists y (B(y) \\land R(x, y)))$:**\nWe must check this for all elements in $D$.\n  - For $x = s_1$: $S(s_1)$ is true. We must check if $\\exists y (B(y) \\land R(s_1, y))$ is true. Let $y = b_1$. $B(b_1)$ is true and $R(s_1, b_1)$ is true. So the existential is satisfied. The implication holds.\n  - For $x = s_2$: $S(s_2)$ is true. We must check if $\\exists y (B(y) \\land R(s_2, y))$ is true. Let $y = b_2$. $B(b_2)$ is true and $R(s_2, b_2)$ is true. So the existential is satisfied. The implication holds.\n  - For $x = b_1$ or $x = b_2$: The antecedent $S(x)$ is false, so the implication is vacuously true.\nSince the formula holds for all elements in $D$, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Phi_2$.\n\n- **Evaluation of $\\Phi_1 \\equiv \\exists y (B(y) \\land \\forall x (S(x) \\rightarrow R(x, y)))$:**\nWe must check if there is any element in $D$ that can serve as a witness for $y$. The potential witnesses are elements for which $B(y)$ is true, i.e., $b_1$ and $b_2$.\n  - Let's test $y = b_1$. Is it true that $\\forall x (S(x) \\rightarrow R(x, b_1))$? Let's test this for all students.\n    - For $x = s_1$: $S(s_1) \\rightarrow R(s_1, b_1)$ is (True $\\rightarrow$ True), which is True.\n    - For $x = s_2$: $S(s_2) \\rightarrow R(s_2, b_1)$ is (True $\\rightarrow$ False), since $(s_2, b_1) \\notin R^{\\mathcal{M}}$. This implication is False.\n    The universal statement $\\forall x (S(x) \\rightarrow R(x, b_1))$ is false. So $b_1$ is not a valid witness.\n  - Let's test $y = b_2$. Is it true that $\\forall x (S(x) \\rightarrow R(x, b_2))$?\n    - For $x = s_1$: $S(s_1) \\rightarrow R(s_1, b_2)$ is (True $\\rightarrow$ False), since $(s_1, b_2) \\notin R^{\\mathcal{M}}$. This implication is False.\n    The universal statement is false. So $b_2$ is not a valid witness.\nThere are no other books in the domain. Since no element $y$ in $D$ satisfies the condition $B(y) \\land \\forall x (S(x) \\rightarrow R(x, y))$, the formula $\\Phi_1$ is false in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nSince we have found a model $\\mathcal{M}$ where $\\Phi_2$ is true and $\\Phi_1$ is false, the implication $\\Phi_2 \\models \\Phi_1$ does not hold. Therefore, $\\Phi_1$ and $\\Phi_2$ are not logically equivalent.\n\n**4. Number of Logically Distinct Scopal Readings**\n\nThe natural language sentence \"All the students read a book\" involves two quantified noun phrases: \"All the students\" ($\\forall$) and \"a book\" ($\\exists$). The constraints of the problem require using standard FOL, which includes restricting quantifiers appropriately (using $\\rightarrow$ with $\\forall$ and $\\land$ with $\\exists$). Within these constraints, the only source of ambiguity is the relative scope of these two quantifiers.\n\nThe possible orderings of the two quantifiers are:\n1. $\\exists \\forall$: The existential quantifier has scope over the universal quantifier. This corresponds to the formula $\\Phi_1$.\n2. $\\forall \\exists$: The universal quantifier has scope over the existential quantifier. This corresponds to the formula $\\Phi_2$.\n\nAs demonstrated above, these two formulations are logically distinct. There are no other ways to arrange the scopes of the two quantifiers. Any other attempted formalization would either be logically equivalent to one of these two, or it would fail to be a faithful representation of the natural language sentence (e.g., by using incorrect connectives, which is ruled out by the problem's constraints of correctness). Therefore, there are exactly two logically distinct scopal readings.\n\nThe number of logically distinct scopal readings is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3058338"}, {"introduction": "The expressive power of first-order logic allows us to move beyond simple claims of existence to specify exact quantities.

This leads to a formula with the structure $\\forall x (Paper(x) \\rightarrow \\dots)$, which states that for any object $x$, if $x$ is a paper, then a certain property holds for it.\n\nThe property to be formalized is that paper $x$ \"has exactly one corresponding author\". The concept of \"exactly one\" is a combination of two conditions:\n1.  **Existence (at least one):** There exists at least one corresponding author for the paper.\n2.  **Uniqueness (at most one):** There is no more than one corresponding author for the paper.\n\nThe phrase \"corresponding author\" itself combines two predicates: the entity must be an author, `Author(y)`, and must be a corresponding author for paper $x$, `Corr(x,y)`. So, the property of \"$y$ is a corresponding author of $x$\" is formalized as the conjunction `Author(y) ∧ Corr(x,y)`.\n\nWe can express \"exactly one\" using the standard quantifiers and equality.
