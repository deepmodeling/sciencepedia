The provided information is complete and consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe two sentences are:\n$\\Phi_{1} \\equiv \\forall x \\exists y \\, (x = y)$\n$\\Phi_{2} \\equiv \\exists y \\forall x \\, (x = y)$\n\nThe structure $\\mathcal{A}$ has the domain $D = \\{0, 1\\}$. The equality symbol '$=$' is interpreted as the standard identity relation on this domain. We will now evaluate the truth of each sentence in this structure.\n\nEvaluation of $\\Phi_{1} \\equiv \\forall x \\exists y \\, (x = y)$:\nThis sentence asserts that for every element $x$ in the domain $D$, there exists an element $y$ in $D$ such that $x$ is equal to $y$.

The sentence becomes $\\exists y \\, (0 = y)$. We need to determine if there is an element $y$ in $D = \\{0, 1\\}$ that satisfies this. If we choose $y=0$, the statement $0=0$ is true. Thus, for $x=0$, the inner existential quantification holds.\n\nCase 2: Let $x$ be assigned the value $1$. The sentence becomes $\\exists y \\, (1 = y)$. We need to determine if there is an element $y$ in $D = \\{0, 1\\}$ that satisfies this. If we choose $y=1$, the statement $1=1$ is true. Thus, for $x=1$, the inner existential quantification holds.\n\nSince for every possible value of $x \\in D$, we have found a corresponding $y \\in D$ such that $x=y$, the sentence $\\forall x \\exists y \\, (x = y)$ is true in the structure $\\mathcal{A}$.

The statement to check is $\\forall x \\, (x = 1)$, where $x$ ranges over $D=\\{0,1\\}$.\n- For $x=0$, we have $0=1$, which is false.\nSince we have found a counterexample ($x=0$), the condition $x=1$ does not hold for all $x \\in D$.

One of the most common and serious errors during PNF conversion is \"variable capture,\" where moving a quantifier accidentally alters the bindings of variables in its scope.

We will address each of the three tasks in sequence.\n\nFirst, we analyze the structure of $\\varphi$. The sentence is formed by an existential quantifier $\\exists x$ whose scope is the formula $\\bigl(P(x)\\land \\forall x\\,Q(x)\\bigr)$. Within this scope, there is a universal quantifier $\\forall x$ whose scope is $Q(x)$. The occurrence of the variable $x$ in $P(x)$ is bound by the outer quantifier $\\exists x$. The occurrence of $x$ in $Q(x)$ is bound by the inner quantifier $\\forall x$. The two quantifiers bind distinct occurrences of the variable named $x$.\n\n**1. Variable Capture from Naive Quantifier Lifting**\n\nThe process of converting a formula to prenex normal form (PNF) involves moving all quantifiers to the front of the formula. A naive attempt to convert $\\varphi$ to PNF might involve directly lifting the inner quantifier $\\forall x$ to the front, alongside the existing $\\exists x$. This would transform the sentence into a new sentence, let's call it $\\psi$:\n$$ \\psi \\equiv \\exists x \\forall x\\, \\bigl(P(x) \\land Q(x)\\bigr) $$\nThis transformation, however, is invalid because it causes **variable capture**.\n\nIn the original sentence $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists x\\,\\bigl(P(x)\\land \\forall x\\,Q(x)\\bigr)$, the occurrence of $x$ in the subformula $P(x)$ is bound by the outer quantifier $\\exists x$. Its meaning is tied to the existence of some element with property $P$.\n\nIn the transformed sentence $\\psi \\equiv \\exists x \\forall x\\, \\bigl(P(x) \\land Q(x)\\bigr)$, the scope of the inner quantifier $\\forall x$ is the formula $\\bigl(P(x) \\land Q(x)\\bigr)$. According to the rules of variable binding, a variable occurrence is bound by the innermost quantifier whose scope contains that occurrence. Therefore, in $\\psi$, both the $x$ in $P(x)$ and the $x$ in $Q(x)$ are bound by the inner quantifier $\\forall x$.\n\nThe occurrence of $x$ in $P(x)$, which was originally bound by $\\exists x$, has been \"captured\" by the quantifier $\\forall x$ as it was moved. This alters the logical meaning of the sentence.\n\nTo see why the truth-conditions change, let's analyze the semantics of both $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$.\nThe sentence $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists x\\,\\bigl(P(x)\\land \\forall x\\,Q(x)\\bigr)$ contains the subformula $\\forall x\\,Q(x)$, which is a closed formula (a sentence). Its truth value is independent of the variable assignment for the outer quantifier. Therefore, we can validly move it outside the scope of the $\\exists x$ quantifier, yielding the logically equivalent form:\n$$ \\varphi \\equiv (\\exists x\\, P(x)) \\land (\\forall x\\, Q(x)) $$\nThis sentence is true if and only if there exists at least one element in the domain with property $P$, AND every element in the domain has property $Q$.\n\nNow consider the malformed sentence $\\psi \\equiv \\exists x \\forall x\\, \\bigl(P(x) \\land Q(x)\\bigr)$. The outer quantifier $\\exists x$ is vacuous because the variable $x$ does not appear free in its scope, $\\forall x\\,(P(x) \\land Q(x))$. A vacuously quantified formula $\\exists y\\,\\chi$ is logically equivalent to $\\chi$ if $y$ is not free in $\\chi$. Thus:\n$$ \\psi \\equiv \\forall x\\, \\bigl(P(x) \\land Q(x)\\bigr) $$\nThis is equivalent to $(\\forall x\\, P(x)) \\land (\\forall x\\, Q(x))$. This sentence is true if and only if every element has property $P$ AND every element has property $Q$.\n\nThe condition for $\\psi$ to be true ($\\forall x\\, P(x)$) is strictly stronger than the condition for $\\varphi$ to be true ($\\exists x\\, P(x)$). For example, in a domain with two elements $\\{a, b\\}$ where $P(a)$ is true, $P(b)$ is false, and both $Q(a)$ and $Q(b)$ are true, $\\varphi$ is true but $\\psi$ is false. The naive quantifier lifting leads to a logically distinct sentence.\n\n**2. Capture-Avoiding Conversion to Prenex Normal Form**\n\nTo correctly convert $\\varphi$ to PNF, we must first perform a capture-avoiding renaming of a bound variable, a process known as **$\\alpha$-conversion**. The conflict arises from the use of the same variable name $x$ in both quantifiers. We can resolve this by renaming one of them. Let's rename the bound variable in the inner quantified subformula from $x$ to $y$.\n\nThe subformula $\\forall x\\,Q(x)$ is logically equivalent to $\\forall y\\,Q(y)$ by $\\alpha$-conversion, provided $y$ is a fresh variable that does not appear in $Q(x)$. This is a fundamental principle of logic: the name of a bound variable is a placeholder and can be changed without altering the meaning.\n\nApplying this to $\\varphi$, we get an equivalent sentence $\\varphi'$:\n$$ \\varphi' \\equiv \\exists x\\,\\bigl(P(x)\\land \\forall y\\,Q(y)\\bigr) $$\nNow, the variables are distinct, and we can safely lift the inner quantifier. The rule for lifting a universal quantifier through an existential quantifier in a conjunction is: $\\exists x\\,(A(x) \\land \\forall y\\,B(y)) \\equiv \\exists x \\forall y\\,(A(x) \\land B(y))$, provided that $y$ is not free in $A(x)$ and $x$ is not free in $\\forall y\\,B(y)$.\nIn our case, $A(x)$ is $P(x)$, which has no free $y$. The formula $\\forall y\\,B(y)$ is $\\forall y\\,Q(y)$, which is a sentence and thus has no free $x$. The conditions are met.\n\nApplying this rule to $\\varphi'$, we obtain the prenex normal form:\n$$ \\varphi_{PNF} \\equiv \\exists x \\forall y\\,\\bigl(P(x) \\land Q(y)\\bigr) $$\nThis sentence has a quantifier prefix $\\exists x \\forall y$ followed by a quantifier-free matrix $P(x) \\land Q(y)$.\n\nTo argue for the logical equivalence of $\\varphi$ and $\\varphi_{PNF}$, we chain the equivalences already established:\n$1$. $\\varphi \\equiv \\varphi'$ by $\\alpha$-conversion.\n$2$. $\\varphi' \\equiv \\varphi_{PNF}$ by the quantifier lifting rule.\nTherefore, $\\varphi \\equiv \\varphi_{PNF}$.\n\nWe can also verify this semantically. As shown before, $\\varphi \\equiv (\\exists x\\, P(x)) \\land (\\forall x\\, Q(x))$.\nThe sentence $\\varphi_{PNF} \\equiv \\exists x \\forall y\\,\\bigl(P(x) \\land Q(y)\\bigr)$ asserts that there exists an element, say $c$, such that for all elements $d$, the statement $P(c) \\land Q(d)$ is true. This can be rewritten as \"There exists $c$ such that ($P(c)$ is true and for all $d$, $Q(d)$ is true)\". The truth of \"for all $d$, $Q(d)$\" does not depend on the choice of $c$. Thus, this is equivalent to \"(There exists $c$ such that $P(c)$ is true) and (for all $d$, $Q(d)$ is true)\". In formal notation, this is $(\\exists x\\,P(x)) \\land (\\forall y\\,Q(y))$.\nSince $\\forall x\\,Q(x) \\equiv \\forall y\\,Q(y)$, we have confirmed that $\\varphi_{PNF}$ is logically equivalent to $\\varphi$.\n\n**3. Computation of $m(\\varphi)$**\n\nThe quantity $m(\\psi)$ is defined as the minimal number of bound-variable renamings ($\\alpha$-conversions) required to convert a sentence $\\psi$ to a capture-free prenex normal form. We need to compute $m(\\varphi)$.\n\nThe sentence is $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists x\\,\\bigl(P(x)\\land \\forall x\\,Q(x)\\bigr)$.\nThe conflict arises from the two quantifiers both using the variable $x$. To avoid capture when pulling the inner quantifier $\\forall x$ to the front, at least one of these two variables must be renamed.\n\n- **Option A: No renamings.** As established in the first part, attempting to lift the quantifier without any renamings results in variable capture. This is not a \"capture-free\" conversion, so this path is invalid. This implies $m(\\varphi) > 0$.\n\n- **Option B: One renaming.**\n    - Case $B1$: Rename the inner bound variable. We change $\\forall x\\,Q(x)$ to $\\forall y\\,Q(y)$, requiring $1$ renaming. The formula becomes $\\exists x\\,\\bigl(P(x)\\land \\forall y\\,Q(y)\\bigr)$. As shown in part $2$, this can be converted to the PNF $\\exists x \\forall y\\,(P(x) \\land Q(y))$ without any capture. The number of renamings is $1$.\n    - Case $B2$: Rename the outer bound variable. We change $\\exists x$ and its bound occurrence in $P(x)$ to use a new variable, say $z$. This single $\\alpha$-conversion results in $\\exists z\\,\\bigl(P(z)\\land \\forall x\\,Q(x)\\bigr)$. In this form, the inner quantifier $\\forall x$ can be lifted without capture, resulting in the PNF $\\exists z \\forall x\\,(P(z) \\land Q(x))$. The number of renamings is $1$.\n\n- **Option C: Two renamings.** We could rename both variables, for example transforming $\\varphi$ into $\\exists z\\,\\bigl(P(z)\\land \\forall y\\,Q(y)\\bigr)$. This would require $2$ renamings and would also lead to a capture-free PNF. However, this is not minimal, as we have already found a valid procedure using only $1$ renaming.\n\nThe minimum number of renamings required is the minimum over all valid capture-free procedures. We have shown that it is not possible with $0$ renamings, but it is possible with $1$ renaming. Therefore, the minimal number of renamings is $1$.\n$$ m(\\varphi) = 1 $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "3049219"}, {"introduction": "With the rules for correct PNF conversion in hand, we can move from simple correctness to strategic optimization.
