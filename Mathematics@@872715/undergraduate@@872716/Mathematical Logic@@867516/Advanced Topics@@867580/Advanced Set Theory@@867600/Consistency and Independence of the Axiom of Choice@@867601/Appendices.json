This first practice challenges you to solidify your understanding of this crucial boundary by distinguishing between what can be built step-by-step versus what requires a true axiom to guarantee its existence [@problem_id:3038981].", "problem": "Let $ZF$ denote Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, $AC$ denote the Axiom of Choice, and $AC_{\\omega}$ (Axiom of Countable Choice) denote the scheme that every countable family of nonempty sets has a choice function.

Finite choice states that if $I$ is finite and each $A_i$ is nonempty, then there is a choice function; this is provable in $ZF$ by induction on $|I|$. Countable choice ($AC_{\\omega}$) asserts the same for $I=\\mathbb{N}$ and is independent of $ZF$. A valid example is: a countable family $(A_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ where each $A_n$ is a two-element subset of $\\mathbb{R}$; in some models of $ZF$ there is no function $f:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ with $f(n)\\in A_n$ for all $n$, although for every finite subfamily a choice function exists by finite induction in $ZF$.\n\nB. Finite choice can fail in $ZF$ because induction does not apply to arbitrary finite families, whereas $AC_{\\omega}$ is equivalent to $AC$.

Finite choice guarantees a choice function for every finite subfamily, but $AC_{\\omega}$ holds outright in $ZF$ whenever all the sets in the family are isomorphic. For instance, for the countable family $\\{X_n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ with each $X_n=X$ for some fixed nonempty set $X$, there need not be a choice function unless $AC$ holds, so this gives a family where countable choice may fail even though finite choice holds.", "solution": "Option A is correct. The principle of finite choice is a theorem of ZF, provable by finite induction. For any finite number of non-empty sets, one can make one choice, then another, and so on, building a choice function step-by-step. This argument fails for a countably infinite family, as it would require an infinite number of steps, which induction does not permit. To make infinitely many choices simultaneously requires a new axiom, the Axiom of Countable Choice ($AC_{\\omega}$), which is known to be independent of ZF. The classic example of a family for which $AC_{\\omega}$ might fail is a countable collection of pairs of objects that have no definable distinguishing property (such as a countable collection of pairs of socks, in Russell's analogy).

The Fraenkel-Mostowski method provides a classic and intuitive way to build such models by introducing \"atoms\" (urelements) and leveraging symmetry to make certain choices impossible. This practice guides you through the foundational definitions of this powerful technique, showing how a group of permutations can create a \"symmetric\" submodel where choice fails [@problem_id:3038975].", "problem": "An advanced undergraduate seminar in mathematical logic is studying how the Axiom of Choice (AC) can be made to fail via the Fraenkel-Mostowski permutation model method. The seminar uses Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with atoms ($ZFA$), in which the universe contains both sets and special objects called atoms (urelements), and then introduces a group of permutations of the atoms together with a normal filter of subgroups to define a symmetric, hereditarily closed submodel. Starting from the following fundamental bases: (i) the schema of axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ($ZF$), (ii) the descriptive clause for urelements in $ZFA$ that atoms have no members and Extensionality compares only sets, (iii) the definition of a group action and of a filter on a partially ordered set (here, the poset of subgroups of a given group under inclusion), and (iv) the notion of a normal filter (closed under conjugation by the ambient group), select all correct statements from the list below that accurately define $ZFA$ and correctly describe the construction of permutation models using a group $G$ of permutations of atoms and a normal filter of subgroups.\n\nA. In $ZFA$, the universe consists of sets and atoms. An atom $a$ satisfies $\\forall x\\,(x \\notin a)$; distinct atoms are permitted even though they have no members.

In the permutation construction for $ZFA$, the filter $\\mathcal{F}$ is taken on the set $A$ of atoms (rather than on subgroups of $G$) and is required only to be closed under supersets and arbitrary unions; a set $x$ is symmetric if there exists a large subset $S \\subseteq A$ from $\\mathcal{F}$ such that every atom in $S$ individually fixes $x$.\n\nD. If $G$ is chosen to be the trivial group acting on $A$, then the class of hereditarily symmetric sets always violates $AC$, because no nontrivial permutations exist to provide supports for choice functions.\n\nE.

We will check in relevant options that each $\\dot{A}_n$ and $\\dot{\\mathcal{A}}$ are hereditarily symmetric. The crucial step for failure of choice is the standard automorphism argument: if a name $\\dot{f}$ is hereditarily symmetric and purports to be a choice function on $\\dot{\\mathcal{A}}$, then some finite support $E$ witnesses $\\operatorname{Fix}(E)\\in\\mathcal{F}\\subseteq \\operatorname{sym}(\\dot{f})$. Choosing $m$ outside the projection of $E$ onto $\\omega$, there is an automorphism $\\pi$ fixing $E$ but flipping the two coordinates at $m$, which forces $\\dot{f}(\\check{m})$ to be simultaneously $\\dot{c}_{m,0}$ and $\\dot{c}_{m,1}$, a contradiction. We now verify which options satisfy the hypotheses needed for this argument.\n\nOption A. Here $\\mathbb{P}$ is the finite-support product of Cohen forcings at coordinates $(n,i)\\in\\omega\\times 2$. The group $\\mathcal{G}$ consists of all automorphisms $\\pi_{\\sigma,\\varepsilon}$ given by\n$$\n\\pi_{\\sigma,\\varepsilon}(n,i)=(\\sigma(n), i\\oplus \\varepsilon(n)),\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma\\in\\operatorname{Sym}(\\omega)$ and $\\varepsilon:\\omega\\to 2$ has finite support (so only finitely many $n$ have $\\varepsilon(n)=1$). This defines order-automorphisms of $\\mathbb{P}$ by permuting coordinates coordinatewise. The normal filter $\\mathcal{F}$ is generated by pointwise stabilizers $\\operatorname{Fix}(E)$ of finite $E\\subseteq \\omega\\times 2$.\n\nFirst, each $\\dot{A}_n$ is hereditarily symmetric: it is fixed by $\\operatorname{Fix}(\\{(n,0),(n,1)\\})$, which lies in $\\mathcal{F}$, since any $\\pi\\in \\operatorname{Fix}(\\{(n,0),(n,1)\\})$ leaves both $\\dot{c}_{n,0}$ and $\\dot{c}_{n,1}$ intact and hence fixes their unordered pair. Moreover, the whole family $\\dot{\\mathcal{A}}=\\{\\dot{A}_n:n\\in\\omega\\}$ is hereditarily symmetric because for any finite $E\\subseteq\\omega\\times 2$, the subgroup $\\operatorname{Fix}(E)$ fixes $\\dot{\\mathcal{A}}$ setwise and pointwise fixes each $\\dot{A}_n$ for $n$ with $\\{(n,0),(n,1)\\}\\subseteq E$, and invariance under the group action suffices for symmetry of the name collecting all $\\dot{A}_n$.\n\nNow suppose toward a contradiction that there is a hereditarily symmetric name $\\dot{f}$ and a condition $p\\in\\mathbb{P}$ such that\n$$\np\\Vdash \\text{“} \\dot{f}\\text{ is a function with domain } \\check{\\omega} \\text{ and } \\forall n\\in\\check{\\omega},\\, \\dot{f}(\\check{n})\\in \\dot{A}_n \\text{.”}\n$$\nBy definition of symmetry, there is a finite $E\\subseteq \\omega\\times 2$ with $\\operatorname{Fix}(E)\\in\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\operatorname{Fix}(E)\\leq \\operatorname{sym}(\\dot{f})$. Let $F=\\{n\\in\\omega:\\ (n,0)\\in E\\ \\text{or}\\ (n,1)\\in E\\}$, which is finite. Choose $m\\in \\omega\\setminus F$. Consider the automorphism $\\pi\\in\\mathcal{G}$ given by $\\sigma=\\operatorname{id}_\\omega$ and $\\varepsilon(m)=1$, $\\varepsilon(n)=0$ for $n\\neq m$, i.e., $\\pi$ flips exactly the two coordinates $(m,0)$ and $(m,1)$. Then $\\pi\\in \\operatorname{Fix}(E)$, hence $\\pi\\in \\operatorname{sym}(\\dot{f})$ and $\\pi p$ and $p$ are compatible (indeed equal on $E$). Using the standard automorphism lemma (if $p\\Vdash \\varphi(\\dot{x})$ then $\\pi p\\Vdash \\varphi(\\pi\\dot{x})$), from\n$$\np\\Vdash \\dot{f}(\\check{m})\\in \\{\\dot{c}_{m,0},\\dot{c}_{m,1}\\}\n$$\nwe get\n$$\n\\pi p \\Vdash \\dot{f}(\\check{m})=\\pi\\dot{f}(\\check{m})\\in \\{\\pi\\dot{c}_{m,0},\\pi\\dot{c}_{m,1}\\}=\\{\\dot{c}_{m,1},\\dot{c}_{m,0}\\}.\n$$\nBecause $p$ and $\\pi p$ are compatible and $\\dot{f}$ is fixed by $\\pi$, it follows that no condition can force a definite value for $\\dot{f}(\\check{m})$, contradicting that $p$ forces $\\dot{f}$ to be a function. More formally, if some extension decided $\\dot{f}(\\check{m})=\\dot{c}_{m,0}$, applying $\\pi$ would decide it as $\\dot{c}_{m,1}$, contradicting the uniqueness of values of a function. Therefore, there is no hereditarily symmetric name for a choice function on $\\dot{\\mathcal{A}}$, and in the symmetric submodel $N$ the family $\\mathcal{A}$ has no choice function. Thus A is Correct.\n\nOption B. The forcing $\\mathbb{P}$ is the same as in A, but the group $\\mathcal{G}$ now consists only of permutations of the first coordinate, i.e., maps of the form $(n,i)\\mapsto (\\sigma(n),i)$ with no flips $i\\mapsto 1-i$ allowed. The filter $\\mathcal{F}$ is generated by pointwise stabilizers of finite subsets of $\\omega$ (viewed naturally as acting on indices $n$). In this setting, define a name $\\dot{f}$ by\n$$\n\\dot{f}=\\{\\, (1_{\\mathbb{P}}, \\langle \\check{n}, \\dot{c}_{n,0}\\rangle ) : n\\in\\omega \\,\\},\n$$\nso that $1_{\\mathbb{P}}\\Vdash \\dot{f}(\\check{n})=\\dot{c}_{n,0}$ for all $n$. This name is fixed by any permutation of $\\omega$ because each coordinate choice is made uniformly by the rule “choose the element at second coordinate $0$,” which is invariant under reindexing of $n$. Therefore $\\operatorname{sym}(\\dot{f})=\\mathcal{G}$, and in particular $\\operatorname{sym}(\\dot{f})\\in\\mathcal{F}$. Hence $\\dot{f}$ is hereditarily symmetric and yields in the symmetric submodel $N$ a bona fide choice function on $\\mathcal{A}$. Consequently, the option’s claim that no choice function exists fails. Thus B is Incorrect.\n\nOption C. Here $N=V[G]$ is the full generic extension. Since $V\\models\\mathrm{ZFC}$ and forcing preserves the Axiom of Choice (the full generic extension by a set forcing still satisfies $\\mathrm{ZFC}$), we have $V[G]\\models\\mathrm{ZFC}$. In particular, every family of nonempty sets, including $\\mathcal{A}=\\{\\{c_{n,0},c_{n,1}\\}:n\\in\\omega\\}$, has a choice function in $V[G]$. Therefore, the claim that $\\mathcal{A}$ has no choice function is false. Thus C is Incorrect.\n\nOption D. The forcing $\\mathbb{P}$ and group $\\mathcal{G}$ are as in A, but the filter $\\mathcal{F}$ is generated by pointwise stabilizers of countable sets $E\\subseteq \\omega\\times 2$. Note that $\\operatorname{Fix}(\\omega\\times 2)=\\{\\operatorname{id}\\}$ is the trivial subgroup, and since $\\omega\\times 2$ is countable, $\\operatorname{Fix}(\\omega\\times 2)$ is one of the generators of $\\mathcal{F}$. Hence the trivial subgroup lies in $\\mathcal{F}$, and by upward closure of filters, every subgroup of $\\mathcal{G}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$. Consequently, every name is symmetric (its symmetry group contains the trivial subgroup), and every name is hereditarily symmetric. The symmetric submodel $N$ therefore coincides with the full generic extension $V[G]$, which satisfies the Axiom of Choice. In particular, $\\mathcal{A}$ has a choice function in $N$. Thus D is Incorrect.\n\nConclusion. Only Option A correctly specifies a forcing, group, and normal filter that produce, via the symmetric submodel method, a countable family of $2$-element sets with no choice function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3038980"}]}
