The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The set of all possible valuations for two propositional variables $\\{p, q\\}$ is finite, consisting of $2^2 = 4$ distinct valuations.

The definition of a valuation and the formula are clear. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nLet the set of truth values be $\\mathbb{B} = \\{0, 1\\}$, where $0$ corresponds to 'false' and $1$ corresponds to 'true'. A valuation $v$ on the set of propositional variables $\\{p, q\\}$ is a function $v: \\{p, q\\} \\to \\mathbb{B}$. The domain of valuations for two variables is the set of all such functions. There are $2^{|\\{p,q\\}|} = 2^2 = 4$ distinct valuations. We can represent each valuation by the pair of values $(v(p), v(q))$. The four possible valuations are:\n1.  $v_1$, where $v_1(p) = 0$ and $v_1(q) = 0$.\n2.  $v_2$, where $v_2(p) = 0$ and $v_2(q) = 1$.\n3.  $v_3$, where $v_3(p) = 1$ and $v_3(q) = 0$.\n4.  $v_4$, where $v_4(p) = 1$ and $v_4(q) = 1$.\n\nThe problem requires us to analyze the formula $p \\to q$. The truth value of a conditional formula $A \\to B$ under a valuation $v$, denoted $v(A \\to B)$, is defined by the standard truth-functional semantics of the material conditional. Specifically, $v(A \\to B) = 0$ if and only if $v(A) = 1$ and $v(B) = 0$. In all other cases, $v(A \\to B) = 1$. This can be expressed arithmetically as $v(p \\to q) = \\max(1-v(p), v(q))$ or as $v(p \\to q) = 1 - v(p)(1 - v(q))$.\n\nWe now compute the truth value of $p \\to q$ for each of the four possible valuations.\n\nCase 1: Valuation $v_1$, where $v_1(p) = 0$ and $v_1(q) = 0$.\nAccording to the definition, the conditional is not of the form $1 \\to 0$. Therefore, $v_1(p \\to q) = 1$.\n\nCase 2: Valuation $v_2$, where $v_2(p) = 0$ and $v_2(q) = 1$.\nThe conditional is of the form $0 \\to 1$. This is not the case $1 \\to 0$. Therefore, $v_2(p \\to q) = 1$.\n\nCase 3: Valuation $v_3$, where $v_3(p) = 1$ and $v_3(q) = 0$.\nThe conditional is of the form $1 \\to 0$. This is the sole case where the material conditional is defined to be false. Therefore, $v_3(p \\to q) = 0$.\n\nCase 4: Valuation $v_4$, where $v_4(p) = 1$ and $v_4(q) = 1$.\nThe conditional is of the form $1 \\to 1$. This is not the case $1 \\to 0$. Therefore, $v_4(p \\to q) = 1$.\n\nThe set of all possible truth values for the formula $p \\to q$ is the set of values computed across all valuations: $\\{v_1(p \\to q), v_2(p \\to q), v_3(p \\to q), v_4(p \\to q)\\} = \\{1, 1, 0, 1\\}$.\nThe distinct values obtained are $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nThe minimum possible truth value, $m$, is the minimum of this set.\n$$m = \\min\\{0, 1\\} = 0$$\nThe maximum possible truth value, $M$, is the maximum of this set.\n$$M = \\max\\{0, 1\\} = 1$$\n\nTo justify that these extrema are attained, we exhibit the specific valuations:\n-   The minimum value $m=0$ is attained by the valuation $v_3$, where $v_3(p) = 1$ and $v_3(q) = 0$. For this valuation, $v_3(p \\to q) = 0$.\n-   The maximum value $M=1$ is attained by, for example, the valuation $v_1$, where $v_1(p) = 0$ and $v_1(q) = 0$. For this valuation, $v_1(p \\to q) = 1$. (Valuations $v_2$ and $v_4$ also result in this maximum value).\n\nThus, the minimum possible truth value of $v(p \\to q)$ is $0$, and the maximum is $1$. The final answer is to be presented as the row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} m  M \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSubstituting the determined values, we get $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3058525"}, {"introduction": "Having explored a formula that can be either true or false, we now advance to using truth tables as a tool for proof.
