A set of Boolean functions is functionally complete if and only if it is not a subset of any of the five maximal clones (Post's classes):\n$1.$ $T_0$: The set of $0$-preserving functions, for which $f(0, 0, \\dots, 0) = 0$.\n$2.$ $T_1$: The set of $1$-preserving functions, for which $f(1, 1, \\dots, 1) = 1$.\n$3.$ $L$: The set of linear functions, which can be expressed as $f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = a_0 \\oplus a_1 x_1 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_n x_n$ for some constants $a_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $\\oplus$ denotes addition modulo $2$ (XOR).\n$4.$ $M$: The set of monotonic functions. A function $f$ is monotonic if for any two input vectors $a=(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ and $b=(b_1, \\dots, b_n)$, if $a_i \\le b_i$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, then $f(a) \\le f(b)$.\n$5.$ $S$: The set of self-dual functions. A function $f$ is self-dual if $f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\neg f(\\neg x_1, \\dots, \\neg x_n)$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties of $\\neg$ and $\\to$ with respect to these five classes.\n\nAnalysis of $\\neg p$:\n- $T_0$: $\\neg p$ is not $0$-preserving because $\\neg 0 = 1 \\ne 0$. So, $\\neg \\notin T_0$.\n- $T_1$: $\\neg p$ is not $1$-preserving because $\\neg 1 = 0 \\ne 1$. So, $\\neg \\notin T_1$.\n- $L$: $\\neg p$ is linear, as it can be written as $1 \\oplus p$. So, $\\neg \\in L$.\n- $M$: $\\neg p$ is not monotonic. We have $0 \\le 1$, but $\\neg 0 = 1$ and $\\neg 1 = 0$, and it is not the case that $1 \\le 0$. So, $\\neg \\notin M$.\n- $S$: $\\neg p$ is self-dual because $\\neg(\\neg(\\neg p)) = \\neg p$. So, $\\neg \\in S$.\n\nAnalysis of $p \\to q$:\n- $T_0$: $p \\to q$ is not $0$-preserving because $0 \\to 0 = 1 \\ne 0$. So, $\\to \\notin T_0$.\n- $T_1$: $p \\to q$ is $1$-preserving because $1 \\to 1 = 1$. So, $\\to \\in T_1$.\n- $L$: $p \\to q$ is not linear. Its algebraic normal form is $p \\to q \\equiv 1 \\oplus p \\oplus pq$. The presence of the second-degree term $pq$ makes it non-linear. So, $\\to \\notin L$.\n- $M$: $p \\to q$ is not monotonic. Consider the input vectors $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$. Component-wise, $(0,0) \\le (1,0)$. However, $(0 \\to 0) = 1$ and $(1 \\to 0) = 0$, and it is not the case that $1 \\le 0$. So, $\\to \\notin M$.\n- $S$: $p \\to q$ is not self-dual. We check if $p \\to q = \\neg((\\neg p) \\to (\\neg q))$. The right side is $\\neg(\\neg(\\neg p) \\lor (\\neg q)) = \\neg(p \\lor \\neg q) = \\neg p \\land q$. This is not equivalent to $p \\to q$. For $p=0, q=0$, $p \\to q = 1$ while $\\neg p \\land q = 1 \\land 0 = 0$. So, $\\to \\notin S$.\n\nNow we evaluate $\\mathcal{I}(S)$ for each subset $S \\subseteq C$.\n\n1.  For $S = \\emptyset$: The empty set of connectives is not functionally complete. With no operators, one can only represent the identity functions on the variables (i.e., $f(p)=p$), but not even constant functions like $f(p)=0$ or $f(p)=1$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{I}(\\emptyset) = 0$.\n\n2.  For $S = \\{\\neg\\}$: As requested, we test the completeness of this singleton. The set $\\{\\neg\\}$ is not functionally complete. All functions that can be generated are unary (e.g., $\\neg p$, $\\neg\\neg p = p$). It is impossible to generate any function of arity $n \\ge 2$, such as conjunction ($p \\land q$). In the context of Post's criterion, the set of functions generated by $\\{\\neg\\}$ is entirely contained within the class of linear functions $L$ and the class of self-dual functions $S$. Since the set is subsumed by a maximal clone, it is not functionally complete. Thus, $\\mathcal{I}(\\{\\neg\\}) = 0$.\n\n3.  For $S = \\{\\to\\}$: We also test this singleton. The set $\\{\\to\\}$ is not functionally complete. Our analysis showed that the implication connective $\\to$ is a member of the class $T_1$ (functions preserving $1$). Any function constructed using only variables and the $\\to$ connective will also be in $T_1$. Specifically, if all propositional variables in a formula built from $\\{\\to\\}$ are assigned the value $1$, every sub-expression of the form $A \\to B$ evaluates to $1 \\to 1 = 1$, and thus the entire formula evaluates to $1$. This means any expressible function $f$ must satisfy $f(1, 1, \\dots, 1) = 1$. However, there are many Boolean functions that do not have this property, such as $f(p) = \\neg p$. Since not all functions can be generated, $\\{\\to\\}$ is not functionally complete. Thus, $\\mathcal{I}(\\{\\to\\}) = 0$.\n\n4.  For $S = \\{\\neg, \\to\\}$: We check if this set is functionally complete. Using Post's criterion, a set of connectives is complete if, for each of the five maximal clones, at least one connective in the set is not in that clone.\n    - $T_0$: The set $\\{\\neg, \\to\\}$ is not a subset of $T_0$ because $\\neg \\notin T_0$.\n    - $T_1$: The set is not a subset of $T_1$ because $\\neg \\notin T_1$.\n    - $L$: The set is not a subset of $L$ because $\\to \\notin L$.\n    - $M$: The set is not a subset of $M$ because $\\neg \\notin M$ (and also $\\to \\notin M$).\n    - $S$: The set is not a subset of $S$ because $\\to \\notin S$.\n    Since the set $\\{\\neg, \\to\\}$ is not contained in any of the five maximal clones, it is functionally complete.\n    Alternatively, working from first principles, we can show that a known complete set of connectives, like $\\{\\neg, \\land\\}$, can be constructed. We already have $\\neg$. Conjunction ($p \\land q$) can be expressed using $\\neg$ and $\\to$ as $\\neg(p \\to \\neg q)$, since $p \\to \\neg q \\equiv \\neg p \\lor \\neg q$, and $\\neg(\\neg p \\lor \\neg q) \\equiv p \\land q$. Since we can construct a complete set, $\\{\\neg, \\to\\}$ is itself functionally complete.\n    Therefore, $\\mathcal{I}(\\{\\neg, \\to\\}) = 1$.\n\nThe problem also implicitly asks about the minimality of $C = \\{\\neg, \\to\\}$. A set is minimal functionally complete if it is functionally complete and no proper subset is. We have shown that $\\{\\neg, \\to\\}$ is functionally complete, while its proper non-empty subsets $\\{\\neg\\}$ and $\\{\\to\\}$ are not. This confirms that $C$ is a minimal functionally complete set.\n\nFinally, we compute the required sum $N$:\n$$\nN \\;=\\; \\sum_{S\\subseteq C}\\mathcal{I}(S) \\;=\\; \\mathcal{I}(\\emptyset) + \\mathcal{I}(\\{\\neg\\}) + \\mathcal{I}(\\{\\to\\}) + \\mathcal{I}(\\{\\neg, \\to\\})\n$$\nSubstituting the values we have determined:\n$$\nN \\;=\\; 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 \\;=\\; 1\n$$\nThe result is a single integer, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3042442"}, {"introduction": "Not all sets of connectives are powerful enough to express every Boolean function, and this practice problem presents a set, $\\{\\to, \\leftrightarrow\\}$, that is fundamentally limited.

The class $T_0$ of functions that preserve $0$ (falsehood-preserving). A function $f(p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n)$ is in $T_0$ if $f(0, 0, \\dots, 0) = 0$.\n$2$.

The class $L$ of linear functions.

We need to check if both $\\to$ and $\\leftrightarrow$ belong to any one of these classes.\n\nLet us define the truth values of the connectives as functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^2$ to $\\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe implication connective, denoted $f_{\\to}(p, q)$, is defined by the following truth table:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cc|c}\np & q & p \\to q \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe biconditional connective, denoted $f_{\\leftrightarrow}(p, q)$, is defined by the following truth table:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cc|c}\np & q & p \\leftrightarrow q \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{array}\n$$\nNow, we test for membership in Post's classes. Let's start with the class $T_1$.\n\nA function $f$ is in $T_1$ if, when all its inputs are $1$, its output is $1$.\nFor the implication connective, we check $f_{\\to}(1, 1)$. From its truth table, we see that $1 \\to 1 = 1$. Therefore, the implication function $f_{\\to}$ is in $T_1$.\nFor the biconditional connective, we check $f_{\\leftrightarrow}(1, 1)$. From its truth table, we see that $1 \\leftrightarrow 1 = 1$. Therefore, the biconditional function $f_{\\leftrightarrow}$ is also in $T_1$.\n\nSince both connectives $\\to$ and $\\leftrightarrow$ are members of the class $T_1$, the set $\\{\\to, \\leftrightarrow\\}$ is a subset of $T_1$.\n\nThe class $T_1$ is closed under composition. This means that any function constructed by composing functions that are in $T_1$ will also be in $T_1$. To demonstrate this, consider a formula $\\phi$ built from variables $p_1, \\dots, p_n$ and connectives from the set $\\{\\to, \\leftrightarrow\\}$. We can prove by induction on the structure of $\\phi$ that the function it represents is in $T_1$.\n- Base case: If $\\phi$ is a variable $p_i$, then when $p_i$ is assigned $1$, the value of $\\phi$ is $1$.\n- Inductive step: Assume $\\phi$ is of the form $\\psi_1 \\to \\psi_2$ or $\\psi_1 \\leftrightarrow \\psi_2$, where the functions represented by $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$ are in $T_1$. By the induction hypothesis, when all primitive variables are set to $1$, both $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$ evaluate to $1$. The value of $\\phi$ is then either $1 \\to 1$ or $1 \\leftrightarrow 1$. In both cases, the result is $1$.\nTherefore, any function that can be expressed using only the connectives from $\\{\\to, \\leftrightarrow\\}$ must be in $T_1$.\n\nThis property restricts the set of expressible functions. For a set of connectives to be functionally complete, it must be able to express all possible Boolean functions. However, we have shown that $\\{\\to, \\leftrightarrow\\}$ can only express functions in $T_1$. There exist Boolean functions that are not in $T_1$. A canonical example is the negation function, $f_{\\neg}(p)=\\neg p$. For this function, $f_{\\neg}(1) = \\neg 1 = 0$. Since $f_{\\neg}(1) \\neq 1$, the negation function is not in $T_1$ and thus cannot be expressed using the connectives $\\to$ and $\\leftrightarrow$.\n\nBecause the entire set of connectives $\\{\\to, \\leftrightarrow\\}$ is contained within the maximal closed class $T_1$, by Post's theorem, this set is not functionally complete.\n\nThe problem defines an indicator value $I$ which is $1$ if the set is functionally complete and $0$ otherwise. Since we have concluded that the set is not functionally complete, the value of $I$ must be $0$.\nThe specific justification is that all formulas built from $\\{\\to, \\leftrightarrow\\}$ belong to the Post's closed class $T_1$ (the set of truth-preserving functions). This containment follows from the fact that both primitive connectives $\\to$ and $\\leftrightarrow$ are themselves in $T_1$, and $T_1$ is closed under functional composition.\n\nTherefore, $I=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3042474"}, {"introduction": "To truly master functional completeness, one must be able to analyze any set of connectives, including those less common in introductory texts.

For an arity-$0$ function, this condition becomes $f()=0$.\n- For $c_0$: $c_{0}() = 0$. Thus, $c_0 \\in T_0$.\n- For $c_1$: $c_{1}() = 1 \\neq 0$. Thus, $c_1 \\notin T_0$.\n- For $\\mathrm{maj}$: $\\mathrm{maj}(0,0,0) = 1$ iff $0+0+0 \\ge 2$, which is false. So, $\\mathrm{maj}(0,0,0) = 0$. Thus, $\\mathrm{maj} \\in T_0$.\nSince $c_1 \\notin T_0$, the basis $B$ is not a subset of $T_0$. Therefore, $[\\{\\mathrm{maj}, c_{0}, c_{1}\\}] \\not\\subseteq T_0$.

The value of $\\mathrm{maj}(z_1, z_2, z_3)$ is non-decreasing as the sum $\\sum z_i$ increases. If $\\mathrm{maj}(a)=1$, then $\\sum x_i \\geq 2$.

The functions are identical. Thus, $\\mathrm{maj} \\in S$.\nSince $c_0 \\notin S$ and $c_1 \\notin S$, the basis $B$ is not a subset of $S$.

That is, $f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = a_0 \\oplus a_1x_1 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_nx_n$ for some coefficients $a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n- For $c_0$: $c_0()=0$ is an affine polynomial of degree $0$ (with $a_0 = 0$). Thus, $c_0 \\in L$.\n- For $c_1$: $c_1()=1$ is an affine polynomial of degree $0$ (with $a_0 = 1$). Thus, $c_1 \\in L$.\n- For $\\mathrm{maj}$: We can determine its ANF.\n$\\mathrm{maj}(x,y,z) = (x \\land y) \\lor (y \\land z) \\lor (z \\land x)$.\nUsing $a \\lor b = a \\oplus b \\oplus ab$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n$\\mathrm{maj}(x,y,z) = (xy \\lor yz) \\lor zx = (xy \\oplus yz \\oplus (xy)(yz)) \\lor zx$\n$= (xy \\oplus yz \\oplus xyz) \\lor zx$\n$= (xy \\oplus yz \\oplus xyz) \\oplus zx \\oplus (xy \\oplus yz \\oplus xyz)(zx)$\n$= xy \\oplus yz \\oplus xyz \\oplus zx \\oplus x^2yz \\oplus yz^2x \\oplus x^2yz^2$\nSince $v^2=v$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n$= xy \\oplus yz \\oplus xyz \\oplus zx \\oplus xyz \\oplus xyz \\oplus xyz$\n$= xy \\oplus yz \\oplus zx \\oplus (1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1)xyz = xy \\oplus yz \\oplus zx$.\nThe ANF is $\\mathrm{maj}(x,y,z) = xy \\oplus xz \\oplus yz$. This polynomial has degree $2$, which is greater than $1$. Thus, $\\mathrm{maj}$ is not an affine function. $\\mathrm{maj} \\notin L$.\nSince $\\mathrm{maj} \\notin L$, the basis $B$ is not a subset of $L$. Therefore, $[\\{\\mathrm{maj}, c_{0}, c_{1}\\}] \\not\\subseteq L$. This class counts towards $N$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe clone $[\\{\\mathrm{maj}, c_{0}, c_{1}\\}]$ is not a subset of the following classes:\n- $T_0$ (due to $c_1$)\n- $T_1$ (due to $c_0$)\n- $S$ (due to $c_0$ and $c_1$)\n- $L$ (due to $\\mathrm{maj}$)\n\nThe number of such classes is $4$.\nThe clone is a subset only of the class $M$.\nThe value of $N$ is the number of classes for which the clone is not a subset.\nSo, $N = 4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3042445"}]}
