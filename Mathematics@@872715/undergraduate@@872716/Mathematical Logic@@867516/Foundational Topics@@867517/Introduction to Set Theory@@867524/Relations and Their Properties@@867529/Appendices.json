The relation $\\leq_R$ is defined as the smallest relation on $X$ that is reflexive, transitive, and contains the pairs $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, $(2,4)$, and $(3,5)$. This construction defines $\\leq_R$ as the reflexive transitive closure of the base relation $R_0 = \\{(1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,5)\\}$.\n\nFirst, we must explicitly determine the pairs in $\\leq_R$.\nThe relation must be reflexive, so it contains all pairs $(x,x)$ for $x \\in X$:\n$\\{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)\\}$\n\nThe relation must contain the generating pairs:\n$\\{(1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,5)\\}$\n\nThe relation must be transitive. We find all pairs implied by the transitivity property:\n- $1 \\leq_R 2$ and $2 \\leq_R 4 \\implies 1 \\leq_R 4$. So, the pair $(1,4)$ must be in $\\leq_R$.\n- $1 \\leq_R 3$ and $3 \\leq_R 5 \\implies 1 \\leq_R 5$. So, the pair $(1,5)$ must be in $\\leq_R$.\nThere are no other composition chains of length greater than $1$. For instance, there is no $z$ such that $4 \\leq_R z$ or $5 \\leq_R z$ with $z \\neq 4$ or $z \\neq 5$, so no further pairs are generated.\n\nCombining all these pairs, the full relation $\\leq_R$ is the set:\n$\\leq_R = \\{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,5), (1,4), (1,5)\\}$\n\nWith this explicit definition, we can proceed with the tasks.\n\nTask 1: Show that $\\leq_R$ is a partial order on $X$.\nA relation is a partial order if it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.\n- **Reflexivity**: The relation $\\leq_R$ was constructed to be the smallest relation containing all pairs $(x,x)$ for $x \\in X$. Thus, for every $x \\in X$, $x \\leq_R x$. The relation is reflexive by definition.\n- **Transitivity**: The relation $\\leq_R$ was constructed as the transitive closure of a base set of pairs. Thus, if $x \\leq_R y$ and $y \\leq_R z$, the pair $(x,z)$ must be in $\\leq_R$. The relation is transitive by definition.\n- **Antisymmetry**: We must show that for any $x, y \\in X$, if $x \\leq_R y$ and $y \\leq_R x$, then $x=y$. This is equivalent to showing that for any distinct elements $x \\neq y$, it is not possible to have both $(x,y) \\in \\leq_R$ and $(y,x) \\in \\leq_R$. We can verify this by inspecting all non-reflexive pairs in $\\leq_R$:\n    - $(1,2) \\in \\leq_R$, but $(2,1) \\notin \\leq_R$.\n    - $(1,3) \\in \\leq_R$, but $(3,1) \\notin \\leq_R$.\n    - $(2,4) \\in \\leq_R$, but $(4,2) \\notin \\leq_R$.\n    - $(3,5) \\in \\leq_R$, but $(5,3) \\notin \\leq_R$.\n    - $(1,4) \\in \\leq_R$, but $(4,1) \\notin \\leq_R$.\n    - $(1,5) \\in \\leq_R$, but $(5,1) \\notin \\leq_R$.\nSince no such symmetric pairs exist for distinct elements, the relation is antisymmetric.\nAs $\\leq_R$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, it is a partial order on $X$.\n\nTask 2: Identify whether a least element and a greatest element exist.\n- **Least Element**: A least element is an element $\\ell \\in X$ such that for all $x \\in X$, $\\ell \\leq_R x$. Let's test the element $1$. We check if $1 \\leq_R x$ for all $x \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$:\n    - $1 \\leq_R 1$: True, from reflexivity.\n    - $1 \\leq_R 2$: True, it is a generating pair.\n    - $1 \\leq_R 3$: True, it is a generating pair.\n    - $1 \\leq_R 4$: True, by transitivity ($1 \\leq_R 2$ and $2 \\leq_R 4$).\n    - $1 \\leq_R 5$: True, by transitivity ($1 \\leq_R 3$ and $3 \\leq_R 5$).\nSince $1 \\leq_R x$ for all $x \\in X$, the element $1$ is the least element of $(X, \\leq_R)$.\n\n- **Greatest Element**: A greatest element is an element $g \\in X$ such that for all $x \\in X$, $x \\leq_R g$.\nFor an element to be the greatest, it must be comparable with and greater than or equal to all other elements. Let's consider the elements $4$ and $5$. The pair $(4,5)$ is not in $\\leq_R$, so $4 \\not\\leq_R 5$. The pair $(5,4)$ is also not in $\\leq_R$, so $5 \\not\\leq_R 4$. The elements $4$ and $5$ are incomparable.\nIf a greatest element $g$ existed, we would have to have $4 \\leq_R g$ and $5 \\leq_R g$. However, there is no element $y$ such that $4 \\leq_R y$ (for $y \\neq 4$) and no element $z$ such that $5 \\leq_R z$ (for $z \\neq 5$). The incomparability of elements $4$ and $5$ is sufficient to prove that no greatest element exists.\n\nTask 3: Identify the sets of minimal and maximal elements.\n- **Minimal Elements**: A minimal element is an element $m \\in X$ such that there is no $y \\in X$ with $y \\leq_R m$ and $y \\neq m$.\n    - We test element $1$: The only $y \\in X$ for which $y \\leq_R 1$ is $y=1$ (by inspection of the relation $\\leq_R$). Thus, $1$ is a minimal element.\n    - For any other element $x \\in \\{2,3,4,5\\}$, we have $1 \\leq_R x$ and $1 \\neq x$. Therefore, none of these elements can be minimal.\n    - The set of minimal elements is $\\{1\\}$. This is consistent with the fact that $1$ is the least element; if a least element exists, it is the unique minimal element.\n\n- **Maximal Elements**: A maximal element is an element $M \\in X$ such that there is no $y \\in X$ with $M \\leq_R y$ and $M \\neq y$.\n    - We test element $1$: $1 \\leq_R 2$ and $1 \\neq 2$, so $1$ is not maximal.\n    - We test element $2$: $2 \\leq_R 4$ and $2 \\neq 4$, so $2$ is not maximal.\n    - We test element $3$: $3 \\leq_R 5$ and $3 \\neq 5$, so $3$ is not maximal.\n    - We test element $4$: We check if there exists any $y \\in X$ such that $4 \\leq_R y$ and $4 \\neq y$. By inspecting the set $\\leq_R$, there is no pair $(4,y)$ with $y \\neq 4$. Therefore, $4$ is a maximal element.\n    - We test element $5$: We check if there exists any $y \\in X$ such that $5 \\leq_R y$ and $5 \\neq y$. By inspecting the set $\\leq_R$, there is no pair $(5,y)$ with $y \\neq 5$. Therefore, $5$ is a maximal element.\n    - The set of maximal elements is $\\{4, 5\\}$.\n\nTask 4: Determine the number of maximal elements in $(X,\\leq_R)$.\nFrom the analysis in Task $3$, the set of maximal elements is $\\{4, 5\\}$. The number of elements in this set is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3050566"}, {"introduction": "Equivalence relations are fundamental tools for classifying objects by grouping them into collections of \"similar\" items, effectively partitioning a set.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for a five-part analysis of a relation on the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$, culminating in the determination of the cardinality of the automorphism group of a resulting algebraic structure.\n\nFirst, we address step 1: Prove that the relation $\\sim$ defined by $x \\sim y \\iff (x - y)$ is divisible by $3$ is an equivalence relation. An equivalence relation must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n\nReflexivity: For any integer $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we must show $x \\sim x$. The difference is $x - x = 0$. Since $0 = 3 \\times 0$, $0$ is divisible by $3$. Thus, $x \\sim x$ holds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSymmetry: For any two integers $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we must show that if $x \\sim y$, then $y \\sim x$. Assume $x \\sim y$. By definition, this means $x - y$ is divisible by $3$. Therefore, there exists an integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $x - y = 3k$. To check if $y \\sim x$, we examine the difference $y - x$. We have $y - x = -(x - y) = -(3k) = 3(-k)$. Since $k$ is an integer, $-k$ is also an integer. This shows that $y - x$ is divisible by $3$, which means $y \\sim x$.\n\nTransitivity: For any three integers $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we must show that if $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$, then $x \\sim z$. Assume $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$. This implies that $x - y$ is divisible by $3$ and $y - z$ is divisible by $3$. So, there exist integers $k, j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $x - y = 3k$ and $y - z = 3j$. To check if $x \\sim z$, we examine the difference $x - z$. We can write $x - z = (x - y) + (y - z) = 3k + 3j = 3(k+j)$. Since $k$ and $j$ are integers, their sum $k+j$ is also an integer. This demonstrates that $x - z$ is divisible by $3$, which means $x \\sim z$.\n\nSince the relation $\\sim$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it is proven to be an equivalence relation on $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSecond, for step 2, we construct the quotient set $\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$. The quotient set is the set of all distinct equivalence classes. The equivalence class of an integer $a$, denoted $[a]$, is the set of all integers related to $a$: $[a] = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid x \\sim a\\}$. The condition $x \\sim a$ is equivalent to $x-a$ being a multiple of $3$, or $x-a = 3k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This is equivalent to $x = a + 3k$. This means that an integer $x$ belongs to $[a]$ if and only if $x$ has the same remainder as $a$ upon division by $3$. By the Division Algorithm, any integer has a unique remainder of $0$, $1$, or $2$ when divided by $3$. This leads to exactly three distinct equivalence classes:\n$[0] = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid x = 3k, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\{..., -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, ...\\}$\n$[1] = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid x = 3k + 1, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\{..., -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, ...\\}$\n$[2] = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid x = 3k + 2, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\{..., -4, -1, 2, 5, 8, ...\\}$\nThe quotient set is therefore $\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim = \\{[0], [1], [2]\\}$.\n\nThird, for step 3, we analyze the operation $+$ on $\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$ defined by $[a] + [b] = [a + b]$. We first prove it is well-defined. Let $[a] = [a']$ and $[b] = [b']$. This means $a \\sim a'$ and $b \\sim b'$. So, $a - a' = 3k$ and $b - b' = 3j$ for integers $k, j$. We must show that the result of the operation is independent of the choice of representatives, i.e., $[a+b] = [a'+b']$. This is true if $(a+b) \\sim (a'+b')$. We check the difference: $(a+b) - (a'+b') = (a-a') + (b-b') = 3k + 3j = 3(k+j)$. Since $k+j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the difference is divisible by $3$, confirming that $(a+b) \\sim (a'+b')$. Thus, the operation is well-defined.\nNext, we verify that $(\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim, +)$ is an Abelian group.\nClosure: For any $[a], [b] \\in \\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$, $[a] + [b] = [a+b]$. Since $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $a+b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, so $[a+b] \\in \\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$. The set is closed under the operation.\nAssociativity: For any $[a], [b], [c] \\in \\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$, we have $([a] + [b]) + [c] = [a+b] + [c] = [(a+b)+c]$. Also, $[a] + ([b] + [c]) = [a] + [b+c] = [a+(b+c)]$. Since integer addition is associative, $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$, so the operation is associative.\nIdentity Element: The element $[0]$ is the identity, since for any $[a] \\in \\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$, we have $[a] + [0] = [a+0] = [a]$ and $[0] + [a] = [0+a] = [a]$.\nInverse Element: For any $[a] \\in \\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$, the element $[-a]$ is its inverse, because $[a] + [-a] = [a+(-a)] = [0]$. Specifically, for $[0]$, the inverse is $[0]$; for $[1]$, the inverse is $[-1] = [2]$ (since $-1-2 = -3$); for $[2]$, the inverse is $[-2] = [1]$ (since $-2-1 = -3$). Every element has an inverse.\nCommutativity: For any $[a], [b] \\in \\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$, we have $[a] + [b] = [a+b]$. Since integer addition is commutative, $a+b = b+a$, so $[a+b] = [b+a]$. This equals $[b] + [a]$. Thus, the operation is commutative.\nSince all axioms are satisfied, $(\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim, +)$ is an Abelian group.\n\nFourth, for step 4, we identify the isomorphism class of this group. The group $G = (\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim, +)$ has order $|\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim| = 3$. Any group of prime order is cyclic. Let's check the element $[1]$. The powers of $[1]$ are $[1]^1 = [1]$, $[1]^2 = [1]+[1]=[2]$, and $[1]^3 = [1]+[1]+[1]=[3]=[0]$. Since $[1]$ generates all elements of the group, $G$ is a cyclic group of order $3$. A familiar example of a cyclic group of order $3$ is $(\\mathbb{Z}_3, +)$, the group of integers under addition modulo $3$. All cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic. A concrete isomorphism $\\phi: (\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim, +) \\to (\\mathbb{Z}_3, +)$ is the natural map $\\phi([a]) = a \\pmod 3$. This map is a homomorphism and a bijection, hence an isomorphism. The isomorphism class is that of the cyclic group of order $3$, denoted $C_3$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\nFifth, for step 5, we determine the cardinality of the automorphism group $\\text{Aut}(G)$. An automorphism is an isomorphism from a group to itself. A fundamental property of homomorphisms, and thus automorphisms, is that they map generators to generators. The generators of a cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ are the elements $k$ such that $\\text{gcd}(k, n) = 1$. For our group $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3$, the elements are $\\{[0], [1], [2]\\}$. The generators are those elements $[k]$ where $k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ since $\\text{gcd}(1, 3)=1$ and $\\text{gcd}(2, 3)=1$. Thus, the generators are $[1]$ and $[2]$.\nAn automorphism $f: G \\to G$ is completely determined by its action on a single generator, for instance $[1]$. The image $f([1])$ must be a generator of $G$. There are two choices for $f([1])$:\n1. $f_1([1]) = [1]$. This extends to the identity map: $f_1([x]) = [x]$ for all $[x] \\in G$.\n2. $f_2([1]) = [2]$. This extends to a non-trivial automorphism where $f_2([2]) = f_2([1]+[1]) = f_2([1])+f_2([1]) = [2]+[2] = [4] = [1]$, and $f_2([0]) = [0]$.\nSince there are two possible images for the generator $[1]$, there are exactly two automorphisms of $G$.\nThe number of automorphisms of a cyclic group of order $n$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(n)$. For $n=3$, the number of automorphisms is $\\phi(3)$. Since $3$ is prime, $\\phi(3) = 3-1=2$. The cardinality of the automorphism group is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3050594"}, {"introduction": "To analyze complex relationships, especially in computer science, we often need a computational approach.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective. All necessary information is provided, and the terminology is standard in discrete mathematics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the given set be $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ and the binary relation $R$ on $A$ be represented by its adjacency matrix $M_R$. The size of the set is $d = |A| = 5$. The entries of $M_R$, denoted $(M_R)_{ij}$, are in the set $\\{0, 1\\}$. By definition, $(M_R)_{ij} = 1$ if and only if $(i, j) \\in R$, which corresponds to the existence of a path of length $1$ from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ in the directed graph corresponding to $R$.\n\nFirst, we establish what the entries of the Boolean power $M_R^n$ represent for a positive integer $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We use induction on $n$.\nThe base case is $n=1$. As defined, $(M_R^1)_{ij} = (M_R)_{ij} = 1$ if and only if there is a path of length $1$ from $i$ to $j$.\nFor the inductive step, assume that for some $k \\ge 1$, the entry $(M_R^k)_{ij} = 1$ if and only if there is a path of length $k$ from $i$ to $j$. We consider the matrix $M_R^{k+1} = M_R^k \\wedge M_R$. The matrix multiplication is over the Boolean semiring $(\\{0, 1\\}, \\vee, \\wedge)$, where $\\vee$ is addition and $\\wedge$ is multiplication. The $(i, j)$-th entry of $M_R^{k+1}$ is given by:\n$$ (M_R^{k+1})_{ij} = \\bigvee_{p=1}^{d} \\left( (M_R^k)_{ip} \\wedge (M_R)_{pj} \\right) $$\nThis entry $(M_R^{k+1})_{ij}$ is $1$ if and only if there exists at least one element $p \\in A$ such that both $(M_R^k)_{ip} = 1$ and $(M_R)_{pj} = 1$. By the inductive hypothesis, $(M_R^k)_{ip} = 1$ means there is a path of length $k$ from $i$ to $p$. By definition, $(M_R)_{pj} = 1$ means there is a path of length $1$ from $p$ to $j$. Concatenating these two paths gives a path of length $k+1$ from $i$ to $j$ via the intermediate vertex $p$. Conversely, any path of length $k+1$ from $i$ to $j$ must pass through some vertex $p$ at step $k$. Thus, the existence of a path of length $k+1$ from $i$ to $j$ is equivalent to $(M_R^{k+1})_{ij} = 1$. By the principle of mathematical induction, the $(i, j)$-th entry of $M_R^n$ is $1$ if and only if there is a path of length $n$ from $i$ to $j$.\n\nNext, we establish how the Boolean sum $\\bigvee_{n \\ge 1} M_R^n$ represents the transitive closure of $R$. The transitive closure of $R$, denoted $R^+$, is the smallest transitive relation containing $R$. An ordered pair $(i, j)$ is in $R^+$ if and only if there exists a path of any finite length $n \\ge 1$ from $i$ to $j$. Let $M_{R^+}$ be the adjacency matrix of $R^+$. Then $(M_{R^+})_{ij} = 1$ if and only if $(i, j) \\in R^+$. This is equivalent to stating that there exists some integer $n \\ge 1$ such that there is a path of length $n$ from $i$ to $j$. From our previous result, this is true if and only if there exists an $n \\ge 1$ such that $(M_R^n)_{ij} = 1$. In the language of the Boolean semiring, this is:\n$$ (M_{R^+})_{ij} = \\bigvee_{n=1}^\\infty (M_R^n)_{ij} $$\nThis holds for all $i,j \\in A$, so the matrix for the transitive closure is $M_{R^+} = \\bigvee_{n=1}^\\infty M_R^n$.\n\nNow, we justify a finite cutoff for the sum. The set $A$ is finite with size $d=5$. If a path exists from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, there must exist a simple path (a path with no repeated vertices). The maximum possible length of a simple path in a graph with $d$ vertices is $d-1$ (if $i \\ne j$) or $d$ (if $i=j$ and the path is a cycle through all vertices). Any path longer than $d$ must contain a cycle, which can be removed to yield a shorter path between the same endpoints. Therefore, if there is a path of any length from $i$ to $j$, there must be a path of length at most $d$. This implies that any pair $(i,j)$ in the transitive closure $R^+$ corresponds to a path of length $n$ for some $1 \\le n \\le d$. Thus, the infinite sum can be truncated:\n$$ M_{R^+} = \\bigvee_{n=1}^{d} M_R^n = \\bigvee_{n=1}^{5} M_R^n $$\nWe now compute the required matrices.\nGiven $M_R = M_R^1$:\n$$ M_R^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  1  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute $M_R^2 = M_R \\wedge M_R$:\n$$ M_R^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  1  0  0  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNext, $M_R^3 = M_R^2 \\wedge M_R$:\n$$ M_R^3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  1  0  0  1 \\\\ 0  0  1  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNext, $M_R^4 = M_R^3 \\wedge M_R$:\n$$ M_R^4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0  0  1 \\\\ 0  0  1  1  1 \\\\ 1  0  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFinally, $M_R^5 = M_R^4 \\wedge M_R$:\n$$ M_R^5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1  1  1 \\\\ 1  0  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  1  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we construct the adjacency matrix of the transitive closure, $M_{R^+} = \\bigvee_{n=1}^{5} M_R^n$. We can compute this as a running sum $S_k = \\bigvee_{n=1}^{k} M_R^n$.\n$S_1 = M_R^1$.\n$S_2 = S_1 \\vee M_R^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  1  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\vee \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  1  0  0  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  1  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  1  1  1 \\\\ 1  1  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$S_3 = S_2 \\vee M_R^3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  1  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  1  1  1 \\\\ 1  1  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\vee \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  1  0  0  1 \\\\ 0  0  1  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1  1  1 \\\\ 1  1  1  1  1 \\\\ 1  1  1  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$S_4 = S_3 \\vee M_R^4$. Every entry in $M_R^4$ that is $1$ corresponds to an entry in $S_3$ that is also $1$. For instance, $(M_R^4)_{12}=1$ and $(S_3)_{12}=1$. Thus, $S_4 = S_3$.\nSimilarly, $S_5 = S_4 \\vee M_R^5 = S_3 \\vee M_R^5$. Every entry in $M_R^5$ that is $1$ corresponds to an entry in $S_3$ that is also $1$. For instance, $(M_R^5)_{21}=1$ and $(S_3)_{21}=1$. Thus, $S_5 = S_3$.\nThe sum has stabilized at $k=3$, so the matrix of the transitive closure is:\n$$ M_{R^+} = S_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1  1  1 \\\\ 1  1  1  1  1 \\\\ 1  1  1  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFinally, we determine $N$, the number of ordered pairs in the transitive closure of $R$. This is the total count of $1$-entries in $M_{R^+}$.\nCounting the $1$s in each row of $M_{R^+}$:\nRow $1$: $5$\nRow $2$: $5$\nRow $3$: $5$\nRow $4$: $2$\nRow $5$: $2$\nThe total number of $1$s is $N = 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 19$.\nThis corresponds to the fact that the graph has a strongly connected component on vertices $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and another on $\\{4, 5\\}$, with a path from the first component to the second ($3 \\to 4$). Thus, any vertex in $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ can reach any vertex in $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, yielding $3 \\times 5 = 15$ pairs. Any vertex in $\\{4, 5\\}$ can reach any vertex in $\\{4, 5\\}$, yielding $2 \\times 2 = 4$ pairs. The total is $15 + 4 = 19$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{19}$$", "id": "3050563"}]}
