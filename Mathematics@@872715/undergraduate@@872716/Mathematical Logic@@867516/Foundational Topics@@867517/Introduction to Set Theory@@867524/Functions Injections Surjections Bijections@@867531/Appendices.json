No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a function $f$ between two finite sets, $A=\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ and $B=\\{a, b, c, d, e\\}$. The function is defined by the following mappings: $f(0)=a$, $f(1)=b$, $f(2)=c$, $f(3)=c$, $f(4)=d$, $f(5)=a$, and $f(6)=b$. We must determine if the function is injective or surjective, find the image and its cardinality, and compute the size of the fiber for each element in the codomain.\n\nFirst, we address the properties of injectivity and surjectivity using their formal definitions.\n\nA function $f: X \\to Y$ is defined as injective (or one-to-one) if for any two distinct elements $x_1, x_2 \\in X$ with $x_1 \\neq x_2$, their images are also distinct, i.e., $f(x_1) \\neq f(x_2)$. An equivalent statement is that if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then it must be that $x_1 = x_2$. To show that $f$ is not injective, we need to find a counterexample: two distinct elements in the domain $A$ that map to the same element in the codomain $B$.\nFrom the definition of $f$, we observe multiple such instances:\n1. $f(0) = a$ and $f(5) = a$. Since $0 \\neq 5$, the condition for injectivity is violated.\n2. $f(1) = b$ and $f(6) = b$. Since $1 \\neq 6$, this also violates the condition.\n3. $f(2) = c$ and $f(3) = c$. Since $2 \\neq 3$, this provides a third violation.\nCiting any one of these pairs is sufficient to prove that the function $f$ is not injective. For example, the elements $0$ and $5$ in the domain $A$ are distinct, yet they both map to the element $a$ in the codomain $B$.\n\nA function $f: X \\to Y$ is defined as surjective (or onto) if its image is equal to its codomain, i.e., $\\operatorname{im}(f) = Y$. This means that for every element $y \\in Y$, there must exist at least one element $x \\in X$ such that $f(x) = y$. To show that $f$ is not surjective, we must find an element in the codomain $B$ that is not the image of any element in the domain $A$.\nThe codomain is given as $B = \\{a, b, c, d, e\\}$. Let us examine the set of output values produced by $f$:\n- $a$ is an output, since $f(0) = a$.\n- $b$ is an output, since $f(1) = b$.\n- $c$ is an output, since $f(2) = c$.\n- $d$ is an output, since $f(4) = d$.\nThe element $e \\in B$ is never produced as an output; there is no $x \\in A$ for which $f(x) = e$. Since the image of $f$ does not include every element of the codomain $B$, the function $f$ is not surjective. A corollary of this is that for a function between finite sets $f:A \\to B$, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for surjectivity is $|A| \\ge |B|$. Here, $|A|=7$ and $|B|=5$, so surjectivity is possible, but the specific mapping of $f$ prevents it.\n\nNext, we determine the image of $f$, denoted $\\operatorname{im}(f)$, which is the set of all values that the function $f$ actually outputs.\n$\\operatorname{im}(f) = \\{ f(x) \\mid x \\in A \\} = \\{ f(0), f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), f(5), f(6) \\}$.\nSubstituting the defined values, we get the multiset of outputs $\\{a, b, c, c, d, a, b\\}$. Since a set contains only unique elements, we write:\n$\\operatorname{im}(f) = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$.\nThe cardinality of the image, $|\\operatorname{im}(f)|$, is the number of elements in this set. Therefore, $|\\operatorname{im}(f)| = 4$.\n\nFinally, we compute the size of the fiber for each element $y \\in B$. The fiber of $y$, denoted $f^{-1}(y)$, is the set of all elements in the domain that map to $y$. Its size is the cardinality of this set, $|f^{-1}(y)|$. This is also known as the size of the preimage of $y$.\n- For $y=a$: The fiber is $f^{-1}(a) = \\{ x \\in A \\mid f(x)=a \\}$. From the function definition, we find that $f(0)=a$ and $f(5)=a$. Thus, $f^{-1}(a) = \\{0, 5\\}$. The size of this fiber is $|f^{-1}(a)| = 2$.\n- For $y=b$: The fiber is $f^{-1}(b) = \\{ x \\in A \\mid f(x)=b \\}$. We have $f(1)=b$ and $f(6)=b$. Thus, $f^{-1}(b) = \\{1, 6\\}$. The size of this fiber is $|f^{-1}(b)| = 2$.\n- For $y=c$: The fiber is $f^{-1}(c) = \\{ x \\in A \\mid f(x)=c \\}$. We have $f(2)=c$ and $f(3)=c$. Thus, $f^{-1}(c) = \\{2, 3\\}$. The size of this fiber is $|f^{-1}(c)| = 2$.\n- For $y=d$: The fiber is $f^{-1}(d) = \\{ x \\in A \\mid f(x)=d \\}$. We have $f(4)=d$. Thus, $f^{-1}(d) = \\{4\\}$. The size of this fiber is $|f^{-1}(d)| = 1$.\n- For $y=e$: The fiber is $f^{-1}(e) = \\{ x \\in A \\mid f(x)=e \\}$. As established earlier, no element in $A$ maps to $e$. Thus, $f^{-1}(e) = \\emptyset$, the empty set. The size of this fiber is $|f^{-1}(e)| = 0$.\n\nAs a check, the sum of the sizes of all fibers must equal the size of the domain:\n$|f^{-1}(a)| + |f^{-1}(b)| + |f^{-1}(c)| + |f^{-1}(d)| + |f^{-1}(e)| = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 7$.\nThis matches the cardinality of the domain, $|A|=7$, so the calculation is consistent.\n\nThe required final answer is a row matrix containing the values $(|\\operatorname{im}(f)|, |f^{-1}(a)|, |f^{-1}(b)|, |f^{-1}(c)|, |f^{-1}(d)|, |f^{-1}(e)|)$.\nSubstituting the computed values, we have $(4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4  2  2  2  1  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3042673"}, {"introduction": "After grasping the basic properties of functions, it's vital to refine our understanding of what defines a function itself.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Core Principles**\nBefore evaluating the options, we must state the governing definitions.\n1.  **Image of a Function:** For a function $h: A \\to B$, its image, denoted $h[A]$, is the subset of the codomain $B$ consisting of all values that the function actually outputs. Formally, $h[A] = \\{y \\in B \\mid \\exists x \\in A \\text{ such that } h(x)=y\\}$.\n2.  **Equality of Functions:** Two functions $f: A \\to B$ and $g: A \\to B$ are defined to be equal, written $f=g$, if and only if they have the same domain ($A$), the same codomain ($B$), and $f(x)=g(x)$ for all $x \\in A$. This is known as pointwise equality.\n3.  **Relationship between Image and Function Equality:** If two functions are equal ($f=g$), then they must have the same image ($f[A]=g[A]$). However, the converse is not true; having the same image does not imply that the functions are equal. Thus, $f=g \\implies f[A]=g[A]$, but the implication $f[A]=g[A] \\implies f=g$ is generally false.\n\nWe will now analyze each option against criteria (i) and (ii).\n\n**Option A**\n-   The functions are specified as:\n    -   $f(1)=u, f(2)=u, f(3)=v, f(4)=v$\n    -   $g(1)=v, g(2)=u, g(3)=v, g(4)=u$\n-   **Analysis of Condition (i):**\n    -   Are the functions distinct?

Then $h(n) = h(2k+1) = (k,1)$.\nSo, $f(n) = f(2k+1) = g(k,1) = \\beta(k) = \\beta((n-1)/2)$. The image is in $B$.\n\nThis construction satisfies the interleaving condition. The explicit formula for $f(n)$ is:\n$$ f(n) = \\begin{cases} \\alpha(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor)  \\text{if } n \\pmod 2 = 0 \\\\ \\beta(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor)  \\text{if } n \\pmod 2 = 1 \\end{cases} $$\n\n**Proof that $f$ is a bijection:**\nA composition of two bijections is a bijection. We have already proven that $h$ is a bijection. We will now prove that $g$ is a bijection.\n\n_1. Injectivity of $g$:_\nLet $(k_1, i_1)$ and $(k_2, i_2)$ be elements of $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\{0,1\\}$ such that $g(k_1, i_1) = g(k_2, i_2)$. Let this common value be $y$.\n- Case 1: $i_1=0$. Then $y = g(k_1, 0) = \\alpha(k_1)$. By definition of $\\alpha$, $y \\in A$.\nIf $i_2=1$, then $g(k_2, 1) = \\beta(k_2) = y$. Thus $y \\in B$. This implies $y \\in A \\cap B$. But we are given that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, so $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $i_2$ cannot be $1$, so $i_2=0$.\nWith $i_1=i_2=0$, we have $g(k_1, 0) = \\alpha(k_1)$ and $g(k_2, 0) = \\alpha(k_2)$. The equality $g(k_1, 0) = g(k_2, 0)$ implies $\\alpha(k_1) = \\alpha(k_2)$. Since $\\alpha$ is a bijection, it is injective, so $k_1=k_2$.\nThus, $(k_1, i_1) = (k_2, i_2)$.\n- Case 2: $i_1=1$. Then $y = g(k_1, 1) = \\beta(k_1)$, so $y \\in B$.\nA similar argument shows that this forces $i_2=1$. Then $\\beta(k_1) = \\beta(k_2)$, and since $\\beta$ is injective, $k_1=k_2$. Again, $(k_1, i_1) = (k_2, i_2)$.\nIn all cases, $g(k_1, i_1) = g(k_2, i_2)$ implies $(k_1, i_1) = (k_2, i_2)$. So, $g$ is injective.\n\n_2. Surjectivity of $g$:_\nLet $y$ be an arbitrary element in the codomain $A \\cup B$.\n- Case 1: $y \\in A$. Since $\\alpha: \\mathbb{N} \\to A$ is a bijection, it is surjective. Therefore, there exists a $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\alpha(k) = y$. Consider the pair $(k,0) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\{0,1\\}$. By definition, $g(k,0) = \\alpha(k) = y$. We have found a preimage for $y$.\n- Case 2: $y \\in B$. Since $\\beta: \\mathbb{N} \\to B$ is a bijection, it is surjective. Therefore, there exists a $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\beta(k) = y$. Consider the pair $(k,1) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\{0,1\\}$. By definition, $g(k,1) = \\beta(k) = y$. We have found a preimage for $y$.\nSince $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, any $y \\in A \\cup B$ belongs to exactly one of these cases. Thus, for any element in the codomain, a preimage exists. So, $g$ is surjective.\n\nSince $g$ is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection.\n\nNow we can conclude about $f = g \\circ h$.\n- **Injectivity of $f$**: Let $n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and assume $f(n_1)=f(n_2)$. This means $g(h(n_1)) = g(h(n_2))$. Since $g$ is injective, we must have $h(n_1)=h(n_2)$. Since $h$ is injective, we must have $n_1=n_2$. Thus $f$ is injective.\n- **Surjectivity of $f$**: Let $y \\in A\\cup B$. Since $g$ is surjective, there exists a pair $(k,i) \\in \\mathbb{N}\\times\\{0,1\\}$ such that $g(k,i)=y$. Since $h$ is surjective, there exists an integer $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $h(n)=(k,i)$. Then, for this $n$, we have $f(n) = g(h(n)) = g(k,i) = y$. Thus for any $y \\in A \\cup B$, there is a preimage $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ under $f$. So $f$ is surjective.\n\nSince $f$ is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $A \\cup B$.
