She has collected the following 20 recent earthquake magnitudes, measured on the Moment Magnitude Scale ($M_w$):\n\n3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.4, 4.5, 5.8, 5.9, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.7, 6.9\n\nTo visualize the data, she considers constructing two different histograms. For both histograms, the bins are defined as left-inclusive and right-exclusive intervals (e.g., $[a, b)$).\n\n- **Histogram 1**: Uses a bin width of 2.0, with the first bin starting at a magnitude of 3.0.\n- **Histogram 2**: Uses a bin width of 0.5, with the first bin starting at a magnitude of 3.0.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate comparison of the insights derived from these two histograms?\n\nA. The wider bin width (2.0) is superior because it clearly reveals a bimodal distribution with peaks centered at 4.0 and 6.0.\n\nB. The narrower bin width (0.5) is misleading because it creates the artificial appearance of gaps and multiple peaks, obscuring what is actually a simple, unimodal distribution.\n\nC. The wider bin width (2.0) obscures the bimodal nature of the data and the significant gap between the two clusters of magnitudes, making the distribution appear deceptively uniform.\n\nD. Both bin widths lead to the same conclusion: that the earthquake magnitudes are uniformly distributed across the observed range.\n\nE. The narrower bin width (0.5) incorrectly suggests the data is skewed to the right, while the wider bin width correctly shows a symmetric distribution.", "solution": "We begin by listing the data in increasing order (already provided): $3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.4, 4.5, 5.8, 5.9, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.7, 6.9$. Observe there is a gap from just above $4.5$ to $5.8$, i.e., no observations in $(4.5,5.8)$.\n\nFor Histogram 1 (bin width $w=2.0$, start at $3.0$), the bins are $[3.0,5.0)$, $[5.0,7.0)$, $[7.0,9.0)$, etc. Counting observations:\n- $[3.0,5.0)$ contains $3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.4, 4.5$ so $n_{[3,5)}=10$.\n- $[5.0,7.0)$ contains $5.8, 5.9, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.7, 6.9$ so $n_{[5,7)}=10$.\n- All other bins have count $0$.\nIn a frequency histogram, bar heights are $h_{j}=n_{j}$; in a density histogram with equal widths $w$, heights are $h_{j}=\\frac{n_{j}}{n w}$. Because $n_{[3,5)}=n_{[5,7)}$ and $w$ is the same for both bins, the two visible bars have equal height. The internal gap $(4.5,5.8)$ is split across these two wide bins and is not visible. Thus this histogram can make the distribution appear flat across $[3,7)$ and obscures the bimodality and the gap.\n\nFor Histogram 2 (bin width $w=0.5$, start at $3.0$), the relevant bins and counts are:\n- $[3.0,3.5)$: $3.2$ so count $1$.\n- $[3.5,4.0)$: $3.5, 3.6, 3.9$ so count $3$.\n- $[4.0,4.5)$: $4.0, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.4$ so count $5$.\n- $[4.5,5.0)$: $4.5$ so count $1$.\n- $[5.0,5.5)$: none so count $0$.\n- $[5.5,6.0)$: $5.8, 5.9$ so count $2$.\n- $[6.0,6.5)$: $6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.2, 6.3$ so count $5$.\n- $[6.5,7.0)$: $6.5, 6.7, 6.9$ so count $3$.\nThis finer binning reveals two clusters (near $[3.5,4.5)$ and $[6.0,7.0)$), a bin with zero count $[5.0,5.5)$, and very low counts in adjacent bins, thus clearly displaying a bimodal pattern and a substantial gap.\n\nComparing insights:\n- The wider bin width $2.0$ masks the internal gap and bimodality by aggregating both clusters into two equal-height bars, making the distribution appear deceptively uniform across $[3,7)$.\n- The narrower bin width $0.5$ appropriately reveals the bimodal structure and the real gap.\n\nTherefore, the statement that best captures this comparison is that the wider bin width obscures the bimodal nature and the significant gap, making the distribution appear deceptively uniform.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1920583"}, {"introduction": "Beyond examining single variables, graphics are powerful tools for exploring relationships between two variables.
