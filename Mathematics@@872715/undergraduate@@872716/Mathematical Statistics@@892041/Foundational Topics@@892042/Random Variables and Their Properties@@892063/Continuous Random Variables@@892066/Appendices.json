During stress testing, a sample is subjected to a normalized strain level, $x$, which can vary from $x=0$ (no strain) to $x=2$ (the maximum design strain). The scientist models the likelihood of a microscopic fracture occurring at a specific strain level with a Probability Density Function (PDF), denoted $f(x)$.\n\nBased on initial observations, the proposed model for this PDF is given by:\n$$ f(x) = \\begin{cases} C(2x - x^2)  \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le 2 \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nHere, $C$ is a positive constant that ensures the function is properly normalized. For $f(x)$ to be a mathematically valid PDF, the total probability over its entire domain must be equal to 1.\n\nDetermine the exact numerical value of the normalization constant $C$.", "solution": "For the function $f(x)$ to be a valid Probability Density Function (PDF), it must satisfy two primary conditions:\n1. $f(x) \\ge 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n2. The total integral of $f(x)$ over its domain must equal 1, i.e., $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\,dx = 1$.\n\nLet's first verify the non-negativity condition. The problem states that $C$ is a positive constant. The function is defined as $f(x) = C(2x - x^2)$ on the interval $[0, 2]$. We can factor the polynomial part as $x(2-x)$. For any $x$ in the interval $[0, 2]$, the term $x$ is non-negative and the term $(2-x)$ is also non-negative. Therefore, their product $x(2-x)$ is non-negative on this interval. Since $C  0$, the function $f(x) = C(2x - x^2)$ is greater than or equal to zero for $x \\in [0, 2]$. Outside this interval, $f(x) = 0$, so the non-negativity condition is satisfied for all real $x$.\n\nNext, we apply the normalization condition. The integral of $f(x)$ over all real numbers must be equal to 1. Since $f(x)$ is zero everywhere except on the interval $[0, 2]$, the integral simplifies to:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\,dx = \\int_{0}^{2} C(2x - x^2) \\,dx = 1 $$\n\nWe can pull the constant $C$ out of the integral:\n$$ C \\int_{0}^{2} (2x - x^2) \\,dx = 1 $$\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral. The antiderivative of $2x - x^2$ is found by integrating term by term:\n$$ \\int (2x - x^2) \\,dx = 2\\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{3} = x^2 - \\frac{x^3}{3} $$\n\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we evaluate the definite integral from $0$ to $2$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{2} (2x - x^2) \\,dx = \\left[ x^2 - \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{2} $$\n\nSubstitute the limits of integration:\n$$ \\left[ x^2 - \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{2} = \\left( (2)^2 - \\frac{(2)^3}{3} \\right) - \\left( (0)^2 - \\frac{(0)^3}{3} \\right) $$\n$$ = \\left( 4 - \\frac{8}{3} \\right) - (0) $$\n$$ = \\frac{12}{3} - \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{4}{3} $$\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the normalization equation:\n$$ C \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right) = 1 $$\n\nFinally, we solve for $C$:\n$$ C = \\frac{3}{4} $$\n\nThus, the value of the normalization constant is $\\frac{3}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$$", "id": "1909879"}, {"introduction": "The parameters that define a probability distribution, such as the interval endpoints for a uniform distribution, have a direct impact on its statistical properties like mean and variance.

The problem states that $T$ follows an exponential distribution.\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) of an exponential distribution is given by $f(t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for $t \\ge 0$, where $\\lambda$ is the rate parameter. The mean of the exponential distribution is related to the rate parameter by $\\mu = 1/\\lambda$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the mean time between detections is $\\tau = 40.0$ seconds.\nTherefore, the rate parameter $\\lambda$ is:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{40.0} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that a particle is detected within the next $t_{interval} = 15.0$ seconds, given that no particle has been detected for the past $t_{wait} = 60.0$ seconds. This is a conditional probability.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that a particle is detected within the time interval $(t_{wait}, t_{wait} + t_{interval})$. This can be written as $t_{wait}  T  t_{wait} + t_{interval}$.\nLet $B$ be the event that no particle was detected in the first $t_{wait}$ seconds. This can be written as $T  t_{wait}$.\n\nWe need to calculate $P(A | B) = P(t_{wait}  T  t_{wait} + t_{interval} | T  t_{wait})$.\nLet's substitute the given values:\n$t_{wait} = 60.0$ s\n$t_{interval} = 15.0$ s\nThe probability we need to find is $P(60.0  T  75.0 | T  60.0)$.\n\nA key feature of the exponential distribution is its **memoryless property**. This property states that for any $s  0$ and $t  0$:\n$$ P(T  s + t | T  s) = P(T  t) $$\nThis means the probability that the event occurs in the next $t$ seconds is independent of how long we have already waited ($s$ seconds).\n\nWe are seeking the probability of detection *within* the next interval, which is the complement of *not* detecting in that interval. Let's rephrase our problem using the survival function $P(Tt)$. The probability we want is:\n$$ P(T  60.0 + 15.0 | T  60.0) = 1 - P(T  60.0 + 15.0 | T  60.0) $$\n$$ = 1 - P(T  75.0 | T  60.0) $$\nApplying the memoryless property with $s = 60.0$ and $t = 15.0$:\n$$ P(T  75.0 | T  60.0) = P(T  15.0) $$\nSo, the probability we seek becomes:\n$$ 1 - P(T  15.0) = P(T \\le 15.0) $$\nThis confirms that due to the memoryless nature of the process, the 60.0 seconds of waiting has no effect on the future probability.
