The outcome of the first die is represented by the random variable $D_1$, and the outcome of the second die is represented by the random variable $D_2$. The rolls are independent events. Since the dice are fair, the outcome of each die follows a discrete uniform distribution, meaning each face has an equal probability of landing up.\n\nFor the specific case where each die has $N=8$ sides, derive the probability that the absolute difference between the outcomes of the two dice is equal to 2.", "solution": "We roll two fair $N$‐sided dice.
