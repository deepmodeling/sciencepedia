A critical quality control metric is the proportion of manufactured pixels that are \"dead-on-arrival\" (DOA), meaning they do not light up. After producing a large pilot batch, a random sample of pixels is tested. The company's statistics team analyzes the sample data and constructs a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of DOA pixels in the entire batch. The resulting interval is reported as $[0.0415, 0.0585]$.\n\nFor a management briefing, two summary statistics are required: the single best point estimate for the proportion of DOA pixels, and the margin of error for this estimate. Determine these two values based on the provided confidence interval.", "solution": "Let the given confidence interval for the true proportion $p$ be denoted by $[L, U]$, where $L$ is the lower bound and $U$ is the upper bound. In this problem, $L = 0.0415$ and $U = 0.0585$.\n\nA confidence interval is constructed around a point estimate. For a proportion, the point estimate is the sample proportion, denoted by $\\hat{p}$. The interval takes the general form $(\\hat{p} - E, \\hat{p} + E)$, where $E$ is the margin of error.\n\nFrom this general form, we can establish a system of two linear equations:\n1. The lower bound of the interval is $L = \\hat{p} - E$.\n2. The upper bound of the interval is $U = \\hat{p} + E$.\n\nTo find the point estimate $\\hat{p}$, we can add the two equations together:\n$L + U = (\\hat{p} - E) + (\\hat{p} + E)$\n$L + U = 2\\hat{p}$\n$\\hat{p} = \\frac{L + U}{2}$\n\nThis shows that the point estimate $\\hat{p}$ is the midpoint of the confidence interval. Substituting the given values:\n$\\hat{p} = \\frac{0.0415 + 0.0585}{2} = \\frac{0.1000}{2} = 0.0500$\n\nTo find the margin of error $E$, we can subtract the first equation from the second:\n$U - L = (\\hat{p} + E) - (\\hat{p} - E)$\n$U - L = 2E$\n$E = \\frac{U - L}{2}$\n\nThis shows that the margin of error is half the width of the confidence interval. Substituting the given values:\n$E = \\frac{0.0585 - 0.0415}{2} = \\frac{0.0170}{2} = 0.0085$\n\nThus, the point estimate for the proportion of DOA pixels is $0.0500$, and the margin of error is $0.0085$.

This interval is extremely informative but difficult to compute.", "solution": "The goal is to determine the 100% confidence interval for a population mean $\\mu$ and assess its utility.\n\nA confidence interval is an interval estimate for a population parameter. Its defining property is the confidence level, $(1-\\alpha)100\\%$, which represents the long-run proportion of such intervals (computed from repeated random sampling) that would contain the true parameter value. A $(1-\\alpha)100\\%$ confidence interval $(L, U)$ for a parameter $\\theta$ satisfies the probability statement $P(L < \\theta < U) = 1-\\alpha$.\n\nThe problem specifies a 100% confidence level. This corresponds to setting the confidence level $1-\\alpha = 1$, which implies the significance level $\\alpha = 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the construction of a typical confidence interval for the mean $\\mu$. If we assume the sample comes from a normal distribution with known variance $\\sigma^2$, the $(1-\\alpha)100\\%$ confidence interval is given by:\n$$ \\bar{x} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\nHere, $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $n$ is the sample size, and $z_{\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution $Z \\sim N(0,1)$ such that $P(Z > z_{\\alpha/2}) = \\alpha/2$.\n\nFor a 100% confidence level, $\\alpha = 0$. We need to find the critical value $z_{0/2} = z_0$. This value must satisfy $P(Z > z_0) = 0$. The probability density function of the standard normal distribution is positive for all real numbers. The only way for the probability in the upper tail to be zero is if the tail starts at infinity. That is, $z_0 = \\infty$. A similar conclusion is reached if we use the t-distribution when the variance is unknown; the t-quantile $t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}$ also approaches infinity as $\\alpha \\to 0$.\n\nSubstituting $z_0 = \\infty$ into the formula for the confidence interval, the half-width of the interval becomes infinitely large:\n$$ \\text{Width} = 2 \\times z_{\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\to \\infty $$\nThus, the interval itself expands to cover the entire real line. The 100% confidence interval for $\\mu$ is $(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\nThis result is intuitive. To be 100% certain that our interval contains the true value of $\\mu$, without making any prior assumptions that would restrict the possible range of $\\mu$, our interval must include every possible value that $\\mu$ could take. Since the problem states $\\mu$ can be any real number, the interval must be the set of all real numbers, $(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\nNow, we must assess the practical utility of this interval. The purpose of constructing a confidence interval is to use sample data to narrow down the plausible range for an unknown parameter. The interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ tells us that the mean is a real number. This is a statement we knew to be true *before* collecting any data. It provides no new information and does not reduce our uncertainty in any way. Therefore, a 100% confidence interval is practically useless or uninformative.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n- A: Incorrect. The sample mean $\\bar{x}$ is a point estimate. For a continuous population, the probability that $\\mu = \\bar{x}$ is zero. This is not an interval with 100% coverage probability.\n- B: Correct. The interval is indeed $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, and it is uninformative for the reason stated.\n- C: Incorrect. It is theoretically possible to construct a 100% confidence interval, as shown above, even though the result is not useful.\n- D: Incorrect. The interval defined by the sample minimum and maximum does not guarantee containing the population mean. For any finite sample, there is a non-zero probability that the true mean lies outside the observed range of the data.\n- E: Incorrect. Any finite interval corresponds to a confidence level strictly less than 100% for a parameter whose domain is the entire real line. No matter how large the constant multiplier (like 100) is, there is always a non-zero probability ($\\alpha > 0$) that the true mean lies outside this finite range.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1908753"}]}
