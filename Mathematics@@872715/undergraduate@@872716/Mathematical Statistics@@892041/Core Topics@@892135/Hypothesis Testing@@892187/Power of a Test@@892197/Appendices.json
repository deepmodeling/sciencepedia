The quality of a production batch is assessed by randomly sampling two components and counting the number of defective ones, denoted by the random variable $X$. Thus, $X$ can take values in the set $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n\nThe standard manufacturing process is considered 'in control' if the probability of a single component being defective is $p = 0.10$. This corresponds to the null hypothesis, $H_0$. A production malfunction could increase this probability, leading to an alternative hypothesis, $H_A$, where the defect probability is $p = 0.45$. Assume that the number of defects $X$ in a sample of two components follows a Binomial distribution.\n\nA simple statistical test is implemented to monitor the process: the null hypothesis is rejected if and only if both sampled components are found to be defective.\n\nCalculate the power of this test.

The alternative hypothesis, $H_A$, is that a blade is defective due to micro-cracks.\n\nA Type I error (a false positive) occurs when a safe blade is incorrectly classified as defective, leading to its unnecessary and costly disposal.

Each batch, referred to as a \"lot,\" contains 100 CPUs. According to the quality standards, a lot is deemed acceptable if its proportion of defective CPUs is 2% or less. The engineer's inspection protocol consists of selecting a random sample of 10 CPUs from each lot *without replacement*. If this sample contains one or more defective CPUs, the entire lot is rejected.\n\nSuppose a particular lot of 100 CPUs has a true defective rate of 10%. What is the probability that the engineer's inspection protocol will correctly lead to the rejection of this lot?\n\nCalculate this probability and round your final answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability of rejecting a lot under a specific condition. Let's define the parameters and the events involved.\n\nThe lot size is $N = 100$ CPUs.\nThe sample size is $n = 10$ CPUs.\nThe sampling method is without replacement.\n\nThe decision rule is to reject the lot if the number of defective CPUs found in the sample, let's call this random variable $X$, is greater than or equal to 1. So, the rejection event is $X \\ge 1$.\n\nWe are given that the specific lot being tested has a true defective rate of 10%. This is the condition under which we must calculate the probability of rejection. In a lot of $N=100$ CPUs, a 10% defective rate means there are $K = 100 \\times 0.10 = 10$ defective CPUs.

It is simpler to calculate the probability of the complementary event, $P(X=0)$, and subtract it from 1. The event $X=0$ corresponds to finding zero defective CPUs in the sample (i.e., accepting the lot).\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$$\n\nLet's calculate $P(X=0)$ using the hypergeometric formula with $k=0$, $N=100$, $K=10$, and $n=10$:\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{\\binom{10}{0} \\binom{100-10}{10-0}}{\\binom{100}{10}} = \\frac{\\binom{10}{0} \\binom{90}{10}}{\\binom{100}{10}}$$\n\nNow we evaluate the binomial coefficients:\n- $\\binom{10}{0} = 1$\n- $\\binom{90}{10} = \\frac{90!}{10!(90-10)!} = \\frac{90!}{10!80!}$\n- $\\binom{100}{10} = \\frac{100!}{10!(100-10)!} = \\frac{100!}{10!90!}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(X=0)$:\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{1 \\times \\frac{90!}{10!80!}}{\\frac{100!}{10!90!}} = \\frac{90!}{10!80!} \\times \\frac{10!90!}{100!} = \\frac{90! \\times 90!}{80! \\times 100!}$$\nThis can be simplified by expanding the factorials:\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{90 \\times 89 \\times 88 \\times 87 \\times 86 \\times 85 \\times 84 \\times 83 \\times 82 \\times 81}{100 \\times 99 \\times 98 \\times 97 \\times 96 \\times 95 \\times 94 \\times 93 \\times 92 \\times 91}$$\nThis is equivalent to the probability of drawing 10 non-defective CPUs in a sequence without replacement.\n\nNow let's compute the value of $P(X=0)$:\n$$P(X=0) \\approx 0.330476307$$\nThe probability of rejecting the lot is the power of the test for this alternative.\n$$P(\\text{Reject}) = P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - 0.330476307 = 0.669523693$$\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$0.669523693 \\approx 0.6695$$\nThus, the probability that the engineer will correctly reject the lot is approximately 0.6695.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6695}$$", "id": "1945734"}]}
