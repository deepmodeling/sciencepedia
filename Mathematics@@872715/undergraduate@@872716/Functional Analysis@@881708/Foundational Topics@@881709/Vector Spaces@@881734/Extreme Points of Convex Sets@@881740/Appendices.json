Extreme points of $C$ (vertices) are points where three linearly independent facet-defining inequalities of the intersection are active.\n\nFirst, note that the vertices of the cube $(\\pm 1,\\pm 1,\\pm 1)$ do not lie in $C$ because their $L_1$-norm is $3>2$.

At such a point, the $L_{1}$-inequality with $s_{r}=\\operatorname{sign}(x_{r})$ for each coordinate is active:\n$$s_{i}x_{i}+s_{j}x_{j}+s_{k}x_{k} = |x_{i}|+|x_{j}|+|x_{k}| = 2.$$\nThe three active planes are $x_{i}=\\sigma_{i}$, $x_{j}=\\sigma_{j}$, and $s_{1}x_{1}+s_{2}x_{2}+s_{3}x_{3}=2$ with normals $e_{i}$, $e_{j}$, and $(s_{1},s_{2},s_{3})$. These normals are linearly independent (since $e_{i}$ and $e_{j}$ span a coordinate plane and $(s_{1},s_{2},s_{3})$ is not in that plane), so the intersection is a unique point, hence a vertex. This yields exactly the points with one coordinate zero and the other two equal to $\\pm 1$, i.e., $(\\pm 1,\\pm 1,0)$ and permutations.\n\n2) One cube face active: Suppose exactly one coordinate saturates $|x_{i}|=1$, say $x_{1}=1$, and $|x_{2}|,|x_{3}|1$. If $|x_{2}|+|x_{3}|1$, then $|x_{1}|+|x_{2}|+|x_{3}|2$, so only one constraint is active and the point lies in the relative interior of a face, not a vertex. If $|x_{2}|+|x_{3}|=1$ with $|x_{2}|,|x_{3}|1$, then two constraints are active: $x_{1}=1$ and $|x_{1}|+|x_{2}|+|x_{3}|=2$. However, there is still a feasible direction preserving both equalities (e.g., $(0, \\delta, -\\delta)$ for small $\\delta$ with appropriate sign choice to keep $|x_{2}|,|x_{3}| \\le 1$), so the point lies on an edge, not a vertex. Concretely, for $x=(1,a,b)$ with $a,b \\ge 0$ and $a+b=1$, one can write\n$$x = \\tfrac{1}{2}(1,a+\\varepsilon,b-\\varepsilon) + \\tfrac{1}{2}(1,a-\\varepsilon,b+\\varepsilon)$$\nfor sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$, and both endpoints remain in $C$, showing $x$ is not extreme. Therefore, no vertices arise with exactly one cube face active unless it reduces to case 1.\n\n3) No cube face active: If no $|x_{i}|=1$, then only $L_{1}$-constraints could be active. In three dimensions, to form a vertex one would need three $L_{1}$-facets active, which would force a vertex of the $L_{1}$-ball, i.e., a point of the form $(\\pm 2,0,0)$ (or permutation), which is infeasible due to $|x_{i}|\\le 1$. Thus this case yields no vertices.\n\nCombining the cases, the only extreme points of $C$ are exactly those with one coordinate equal to $0$ and the other two equal to $\\pm 1$, in all sign combinations and permutations.

Therefore $S$ is the Cartesian product of three identical $1$-simplices. A standard fact for Cartesian products of convex sets is that a point is extreme in the product if and only if each coordinate is extreme in its factor. Concretely here, a matrix in $S$ is an extreme point if and only if each of its three rows is one of the vertices $(1,0)$ or $(0,1)$. We justify both directions explicitly.\n\nSufficiency: Suppose a matrix $X \\in S$ has each row equal to either $(1,0)$ or $(0,1)$. Assume $X = tY + (1-t)Z$ with $Y,Z \\in S$ and $t \\in (0,1)$. Consider any row of $X$ equal to $(1,0)$.

The equality $t y + (1-t) z = (1,0)$ yields the system\n$$\nt y_{1} + (1-t) z_{1} = 1, \\quad t y_{2} + (1-t) z_{2} = 0.\n$$\nSince $y_{2},z_{2} \\ge 0$ and $t \\in (0,1)$, the second equation implies $y_{2} = z_{2} = 0$, hence $y_{1} = z_{1} = 1$. Thus the row of $Y$ and $Z$ coincide with that of $X$. The same argument applies to any row equal to $(0,1)$, forcing the corresponding rows of $Y$ and $Z$ to be $(0,1)$. Therefore $Y=Z=X$, so $X$ is extreme.\n\nNecessity: If a matrix $X \\in S$ has a row equal to $(\\theta,1-\\theta)$ with $\\theta \\in (0,1)$, then let $E^{(1)}$ be the matrix obtained from $X$ by replacing that row with $(1,0)$ and $E^{(2)}$ the matrix obtained by replacing it with $(0,1)$, keeping all other rows identical to those of $X$.
