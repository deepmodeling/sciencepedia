A metric space is complete if it contains the limits of all its Cauchy sequences—in essence, it has no \"holes.\" This exercise asks you to investigate the set of rational numbers, the archetypal example of an incomplete space, by finding a sequence of rational numbers that attempts to converge to a point outside the set. [@problem_id:1850254]", "problem": "Consider the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ equipped with the standard metric $d(x, y) = |x - y|$.

We consider $S$ as a metric space with the metric $d$ inherited from $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nRecall that a metric space is defined as 'complete' if every Cauchy sequence of points within that space converges to a limit that is also an element of the space.\n\nBased on this definition, which of the following statements correctly assesses the completeness of the metric space $(S, d)$?\n\nA. Yes, the space $(S, d)$ is complete because $S$ is a subset of a bounded interval $[0, 5]$ and is therefore a bounded set.\n\nB. Yes, the space $(S, d)$ is complete because the interval $[0, 5]$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nC. No, the space $(S, d)$ is not complete because there exists at least one Cauchy sequence in $S$ whose limit is not in $S$.\n\nD. No, the space $(S, d)$ is not complete because $S$ contains its endpoints 0 and 5, making it not an open set.", "solution": "To determine if the metric space $(S, d)$, where $S = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 5]$, is complete, we must check if every Cauchy sequence in $S$ converges to a limit that is also in $S$. If we can find a single counterexample—a Cauchy sequence of points in $S$ whose limit is not in $S$—then the space is not complete.\n\nLet's choose an irrational number that lies within the interval $[0, 5]$. A classic example is the square root of 2, $\\sqrt{2}$. We know that $1^2 = 1$ and $2^2 = 4$, which implies that $1  \\sqrt{2}  2$. Therefore, $\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of the interval $[0, 5]$. However, $\\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number, so by definition, $\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$. Consequently, $\\sqrt{2}$ is not an element of our set $S = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 5]$.\n\nNow, we will construct a sequence $(x_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ of points in $S$ that converges to $\\sqrt{2}$. Let the sequence be the successive decimal approximations of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n$x_1 = 1.4$\n$x_2 = 1.41$\n$x_3 = 1.414$\n$x_4 = 1.4142$\n...and so on.\n\nLet's verify that this sequence $(x_n)$ has the required properties.\n1. Each term $x_n$ is a terminating decimal. Any terminating decimal can be written as a fraction with a power of 10 in the denominator, so each $x_n$ is a rational number. For example, $x_3 = 1.414 = \\frac{1414}{1000}$.\n2. Each term $x_n$ is in the interval $[0, 5]$. As we saw, $1  \\sqrt{2}  2$, and the sequence of decimal approximations monotonically increases towards $\\sqrt{2}$, so all terms will be between 1 and 2. Thus, all $x_n$ are in $[0, 5]$.\n3. Combining these two facts, every term $x_n$ is a rational number in $[0, 5]$, which means $(x_n)$ is a sequence in $S$.\n\nNext, we must verify that $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence. In the larger space $\\mathbb{R}$, this sequence converges to the limit $L = \\sqrt{2}$. A fundamental theorem of metric spaces states that any convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence. Therefore, $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{R}$. Since the metric $d$ on $S$ is the same as the metric on $\\mathbb{R}$, the condition for being a Cauchy sequence is identical. Thus, $(x_n)$ is also a Cauchy sequence in $S$.\n\nFinally, we examine the limit of this sequence. The limit is $L = \\sqrt{2}$. As established earlier, $\\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number and is therefore not an element of $S$.\n\nWe have successfully constructed a sequence $(x_n)$ of points in $S$ which is a Cauchy sequence, but its limit, $\\sqrt{2}$, does not belong to $S$. By the definition of completeness, the metric space $(S, d)$ is not complete.\n\nThis directly corresponds to option C. Let's analyze the other options:\n- Option A is incorrect. While $S$ is indeed bounded, boundedness alone is not sufficient for completeness. The Heine-Borel theorem states that a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact (and thus complete) if and only if it is closed and bounded. $S$ is not a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$ because it does not contain all of its limit points (e.g., $\\sqrt{2}$).\n- Option B is incorrect. The fact that the interval $[0, 5]$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$ means any convergent sequence of points from $[0, 5]$ will have its limit in $[0, 5]$. However, our sequence of *rational* points has an *irrational* limit, which is not in our subspace $S$. The property of the containing interval does not guarantee completeness for the subspace of rationals.\n- Option D is incorrect. Whether a set is open or closed is relevant to completeness (a subspace of a complete space is complete iff it is closed), but being \"not open\" is not the reason for being \"not complete\". For example, $[0, 1]$ as a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}$ is not open, but it is complete.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1850254"}, {"introduction": "Why is the concept of completeness so fundamental in analysis?
