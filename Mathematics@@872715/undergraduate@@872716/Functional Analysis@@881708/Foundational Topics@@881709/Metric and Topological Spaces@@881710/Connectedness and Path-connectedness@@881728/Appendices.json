Each polynomial $p(x) = x^2 + bx + c$ is uniquely determined by its coefficients $(b,c)$. The mapping $\\phi: X \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ given by $\\phi(p) = (b,c)$ is a bijection. The topology on $X$ is induced by the supremum norm, and on the finite-dimensional space of coefficients, all norms are equivalent. For example, for two polynomials $p_1(x) = x^2+b_1x+c_1$ and $p_2(x) = x^2+b_2x+c_2$, their difference norm is $\\|p_1 - p_2\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} |(b_1 - b_2)x + (c_1 - c_2)|$. This norm on the coefficient space $(b,c)$ is equivalent to any standard norm on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (like the Euclidean norm $\\|(b_1-b_2, c_1-c_2)\\|_2$). Therefore, studying the topological properties of $S \\subset X$ is equivalent to studying the topological properties of the corresponding set of coefficients $\\mathcal{S} = \\phi(S) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ with its standard topology.\n\nA polynomial $p(x) = x^2 + bx + c$ has at least one root in $[0,1]$ if and only if one of two conditions is met, based on the behavior of the upward-opening parabola $y=p(x)$:\n\n1.  The values of the polynomial at the endpoints of the interval, $p(0)$ and $p(1)$, have non-positive product. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, if $p(0)p(1)  0$, there must be a root in $(0,1)$. If $p(0)=0$ or $p(1)=0$, then $0$ or $1$ is a root.\n    - We have $p(0) = c$ and $p(1) = 1 + b + c$.\n    - This condition is $p(0)p(1) \\le 0$, which translates to the inequality for the coefficients: $c(1+b+c) \\le 0$.\n    - Let's call the set of points $(b,c)$ satisfying this condition $R_1$. This is the closed region in the $bc$-plane between the lines $L_0: c=0$ and $L_1: c=-b-1$. This region is unbounded but path-connected, as any two points in the region can be connected by a path that remains within it.\n\n2.  The values $p(0)$ and $p(1)$ are both non-negative, but the parabola dips low enough to have roots within $[0,1]$. (The case where both are non-positive is handled by case 1, as the vertex must be even more negative).\n    - This condition implies that the vertex of the parabola lies between $x=0$ and $x=1$, and the value at the vertex is non-positive.\n    - The vertex of $p(x)$ is at $x_v = -b/2$. So we require $0 \\le -b/2 \\le 1$, which means $-2 \\le b \\le 0$.\n    - The value at the vertex is $p(x_v) = p(-b/2) = (-b/2)^2 + b(-b/2) + c = c - b^2/4$. We require $p(x_v) \\le 0$, so $c \\le b^2/4$.\n    - The condition that $p(0)$ and $p(1)$ are non-negative gives $c \\ge 0$ and $1+b+c \\ge 0$.\n    - Let's call the set of points $(b,c)$ satisfying this second set of conditions $R_2$.\n    - $R_2 = \\{(b,c) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid -2 \\le b \\le 0, c \\ge 0, 1+b+c \\ge 0, \\text{ and } c \\le b^2/4\\}$.\n    - The set $R_2$ is defined by the intersection of regions defined by linear inequalities ($b \\ge -2$, $b \\le 0$, $c \\ge 0$, $1+b+c \\ge 0$) and one quadratic inequality ($c - b^2/4 \\le 0$). The function $g(b,c) = c-b^2/4$ is a convex function, so the set where $g(b,c) \\le 0$ is a convex set. The intersection of convex sets is convex. Thus, $R_2$ is a convex set. A non-empty convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is path-connected.\n\nThe total set of coefficients is the union $\\mathcal{S} = R_1 \\cup R_2$. We have established that both $R_1$ and $R_2$ are path-connected. A union of two path-connected sets is path-connected if their intersection is non-empty. Let's analyze the intersection $R_1 \\cap R_2$.\n- A point $(b,c)$ is in $R_1$ if $c(1+b+c) \\le 0$.\n- A point $(b,c)$ is in $R_2$ if it satisfies the conditions listed for $R_2$, which include $c \\ge 0$ and $1+b+c \\ge 0$. For these points, the product $c(1+b+c)$ must be non-negative.\n- Therefore, for a point to be in the intersection $R_1 \\cap R_2$, we must have $c(1+b+c)=0$. This means the intersection consists of points in $R_2$ that lie on the boundaries $c=0$ or $c=-b-1$.\n- If $c=0$: The conditions for $R_2$ become $-2 \\le b \\le 0$, $1+b \\ge 0$ (so $b \\ge -1$), and $0 \\le b^2/4$ (always true). So, this part of the intersection is the line segment $\\{(b,0) \\mid -1 \\le b \\le 0\\}$.\n- If $c=-b-1$: The conditions for $R_2$ become $-2 \\le b \\le 0$, $-b-1 \\ge 0$ (so $b \\le -1$), and $-b-1 \\le b^2/4$. The last inequality simplifies to $0 \\le b^2/4 + b + 1 = (b/2+1)^2$, which is always true. So this part of the intersection is the line segment $\\{(b, -b-1) \\mid -2 \\le b \\le -1\\}$.\n- The intersection $R_1 \\cap R_2$ is the union of two line segments: one from $(-1,0)$ to $(0,0)$, and the other from $(-2,1)$ to $(-1,0)$. These two segments meet at the point $(-1,0)$. Thus, their union is a non-empty, path-connected set.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{S} = R_1 \\cup R_2$ is a union of two path-connected sets ($R_1$ and $R_2$) with a non-empty (and path-connected) intersection, the set $\\mathcal{S}$ is path-connected. Consequently, the original set of polynomials $S$ is path-connected.\n\nSince path-connectedness implies connectedness, option A is correct, while B and C are incorrect.\n\nLet's check the other options.\n- D. Is $S$ compact? The corresponding set $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. The set $R_1$ contains, for example, the points $(b,1)$ for all $b$ such that $1(1+b+1) \\le 0$, i.e., $b+2 \\le 0$, so $b \\le -2$. This is an unbounded set of points. Since $\\mathcal{S}$ is unbounded, it is not compact. So D is incorrect.\n- E. Is $S$ an open set? The set $\\mathcal{S}$ is defined by non-strict inequalities ($\\le, \\ge$) of continuous functions, which means $\\mathcal{S}$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. For instance, the polynomial $p(x)=x^2$ (with $(b,c)=(0,0)$) has a root at $x=0$, so it lies in $S$. However, any open ball around $(0,0)$ in the coefficient space contains points $(0, \\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon  0$. The polynomial $p(x)=x^2+\\epsilon$ has no real roots and thus is not in $S$.
