A projection is an element $x$ in the algebra such that it is self-adjoint ($x^* = x$) and idempotent ($x^2 = x$). The defining relations for the algebra $A$ are therefore $p^* = p$, $p^2 = p$, $q^* = q$, $q^2 = q$, and $pq = qp$.

The Gelfand-Naimark theorem states that $A$ is isometrically *-isomorphic to the algebra $C(X)$ of continuous functions on its character space $X$. The points of $X$ are the characters of $A$, which are non-zero *-homomorphisms $\\chi: A \\to \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nA character $\\chi \\in X$ is a multiplicative linear functional that also satisfies $\\chi(a^*) = \\overline{\\chi(a)}$ for all $a \\in A$. Since $p$ and $q$ (along with the identity element $1$) generate the algebra $A$, any character $\\chi$ is completely determined by its values on $p$ and $q$.\n\nLet's determine the possible values for $\\chi(p)$ and $\\chi(q)$.\nSince $p$ is a projection, it satisfies $p^2 = p$. Applying the character $\\chi$, which is multiplicative, we get:\n$$ \\chi(p^2) = \\chi(p) $$\n$$ (\\chi(p))^2 = \\chi(p) $$\nLet $z = \\chi(p)$. The equation $z^2 = z$ has two solutions in $\\mathbb{C}$: $z=0$ and $z=1$.\nAdditionally, since $p$ is self-adjoint ($p^*=p$), we must have:\n$$ \\chi(p^*) = \\overline{\\chi(p)} $$\n$$ \\chi(p) = \\overline{\\chi(p)} $$\nThis means $\\chi(p)$ must be a real number. The values $0$ and $1$ are both real, so this condition is consistent. Therefore, for any character $\\chi$, we must have $\\chi(p) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nExactly the same argument applies to the projection $q$, so we must also have $\\chi(q) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nThese constraints imply that there are at most $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible characters, determined by the pairs of values $(\\chi(p), \\chi(q))$. The possible pairs are:\n1.  $(0, 0)$\n2.  $(0, 1)$\n3.  $(1, 0)$\n4.  $(1, 1)$\n\nThe question now is whether each of these four possibilities corresponds to an actual character in the space $X$. For a character to exist for each case, we must show that none of the cases lead to a contradiction within the algebra. The algebra $A$ is \"universal,\" meaning it has no relations other than those specified. This implies that any element that is not forced to be zero by the defining relations is indeed non-zero.\n\nLet's construct four elements in $A$ that correspond to these four possibilities. Since $p$ and $q$ commute, we can define the following four elements:\n- $e_{00} = (1-p)(1-q)$\n- $e_{01} = (1-p)q$\n- $e_{10} = p(1-q)$\n- $e_{11} = pq$\n\nLet's check the properties of these elements. They are all projections. For example, for $e_{11}$:\n$e_{11}^* = (pq)^* = q^*p^* = qp = pq = e_{11}$ (self-adjoint).\n$e_{11}^2 = (pq)^2 = pqpq = ppqq = p^2q^2 = pq = e_{11}$ (idempotent).\nA similar check confirms that all four $e_{ij}$ are projections.\n\nThese four projections are mutually orthogonal. For instance:\n$e_{10} e_{11} = (p(1-q))(pq) = p(1-q)pq = p(p-qp)q = p(p-pq)q = (p^2-p^2q)q = (p-pq)q = pq - pq^2 = pq - pq = 0$.\n\nTheir sum is the identity element:\n$e_{00} + e_{01} + e_{10} + e_{11} = (1-p-q+pq) + (q-pq) + (p-pq) + pq = 1$.\n\nIn the universal algebra $A$, each of these projections $e_{ij}$ is non-zero. If any were zero, it would impose an additional relation on $p$ and $q$ (e.g., if $pq=0$). Since each $e_{ij}$ is a non-zero projection, there must exist a character $\\chi_{ij}$ such that $\\chi_{ij}(e_{ij}) = 1$.\n\n- If $\\chi_{11}(e_{11}) = \\chi_{11}(pq) = 1$, then by multiplicativity, $\\chi_{11}(p)\\chi_{11}(q) = 1$. Since $\\chi_{11}(p)$ and $\\chi_{11}(q)$ can only be 0 or 1, this forces $\\chi_{11}(p)=1$ and $\\chi_{11}(q)=1$. This realizes the pair $(1,1)$.\n- If $\\chi_{10}(e_{10}) = \\chi_{10}(p(1-q)) = 1$, then $\\chi_{10}(p)(1-\\chi_{10}(q)) = 1$. This forces $\\chi_{10}(p)=1$ and $1-\\chi_{10}(q)=1$, which means $\\chi_{10}(q)=0$. This realizes the pair $(1,0)$.\n- If $\\chi_{01}(e_{01}) = \\chi_{01}((1-p)q) = 1$, then $(1-\\chi_{01}(p))\\chi_{01}(q) = 1$. This forces $1-\\chi_{01}(p)=1$ and $\\chi_{01}(q)=1$, which means $\\chi_{01}(p)=0$. This realizes the pair $(0,1)$.\n- If $\\chi_{00}(e_{00}) = \\chi_{00}((1-p)(1-q)) = 1$, then $(1-\\chi_{00}(p))(1-\\chi_{00}(q)) = 1$. This forces $1-\\chi_{00}(p)=1$ and $1-\\chi_{00}(q)=1$, which means $\\chi_{00}(p)=0$ and $\\chi_{00}(q)=0$. This realizes the pair $(0,0)$.\n\nSince all four potential pairs of values $(\\chi(p), \\chi(q))$ are realized by actual characters, the character space $X$ contains exactly four points. For a C*-algebra, the character space is always a compact Hausdorff space. A finite set with the discrete topology is compact and Hausdorff. Thus, the character space is a four-point discrete space.\n\nThe algebra $A$ is therefore isomorphic to $C(X) \\cong \\mathbb{C}^4$, where the isomorphism maps an element $a \\in A$ to the 4-tuple $(\\chi_{00}(a), \\chi_{01}(a), \\chi_{10}(a), \\chi_{11}(a))$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1891581"}]}
