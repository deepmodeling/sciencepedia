Therefore, we are looking for the values of $c$ such that $0 \\in \\sigma(p(T))$.\n\nWe can solve this using the Spectral Mapping Theorem for polynomials. The theorem states that if $T$ is a bounded linear operator on a Banach space and $p$ is a polynomial, then the spectrum of the operator $p(T)$ is given by the image of the spectrum of $T$ under the polynomial $p$.

This is a quadratic function, representing a downward-opening parabola. The extreme values on a closed interval will occur either at the boundaries of the interval or at a critical point within the interval.\n\nFirst, we find the critical points by taking the derivative of $f(\\lambda)$ with respect to $\\lambda$ and setting it to zero:\n$$ f'(\\lambda) = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}(5\\lambda - \\lambda^2) = 5 - 2\\lambda $$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$ 5 - 2\\lambda = 0 \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 $$\nSince this critical point $\\lambda = 2.5$ lies within our interval $[0, 4]$, it is a candidate for an extremum. As the second derivative is $f''(\\lambda) = -2  0$, this point corresponds to a local maximum, which is the global maximum for the parabola.\n\nNow, we evaluate the function $f(\\lambda)$ at this critical point and at the endpoints of the interval $[0, 4]$:\n1. At the left endpoint, $\\lambda = 0$:\n   $f(0) = 5(0) - 0^2 = 0$.\n2. At the right endpoint, $\\lambda = 4$:\n   $f(4) = 5(4) - 4^2 = 20 - 16 = 4$.\n3. At the critical point, $\\lambda = 2.5$:\n   $f(2.5) = 5(2.5) - (2.5)^2 = 12.5 - 6.25 = 6.25$.\n\nComparing these values, the minimum value of $f(\\lambda)$ on the interval $[0, 4]$ is $0$ (which occurs at $\\lambda=0$) and the maximum value is $6.25$ (which occurs at $\\lambda=2.5$).\n\nTherefore, the range of the function $f(\\lambda)$ on the interval $[0, 4]$ is $[0, 6.25]$. This is precisely the set of all possible values for $c$ such that the equation $c = 5\\lambda - \\lambda^2$ has a solution for $\\lambda \\in [0, 4]$.\n\nThus, the set of all real values of $c$ for which $p(T)$ is non-invertible is the closed interval $[0, 6.25]$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. $[0, 4]$\nB. $[-6.25, 0]$\nC. $[0, 6.25]$\nD. $[-4, 0]$\nE. $(-\\infty, 6.25]$\n\nThe correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1902417"}]}
