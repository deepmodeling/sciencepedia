## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the formal definitions and fundamental properties of closable operators and their closures. While these concepts may seem abstract, they are in fact indispensable tools in modern mathematics and theoretical sciences. Many of the most important operators encountered in physics and analysis—particularly differential operators—are unbounded and cannot be defined on an [entire function](@entry_id:178769) space. The framework of closable operators and their closures provides the essential mechanism for handling these operators in a rigorous and meaningful way. This chapter will explore how the principles of closability are applied in diverse fields, demonstrating their power to extend classical calculus, to provide a firm mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics, and to build new analytical frameworks for [stochastic processes](@entry_id:141566).

### The Role of Closure in Extending and Regularizing Operators

At its core, the process of taking the closure of an operator is an act of extension and regularization. We often begin with an operator defined on a small, convenient domain of "well-behaved" elements, such as smooth functions or sequences with finite support. The closure then extends this operator to the largest possible domain on which its action remains coherent.

#### From Dense Domains to Bounded Operators

A foundational application of closure arises when an operator defined on a [dense subspace](@entry_id:261392) is known to be bounded. In this scenario, its closure becomes a [bounded operator](@entry_id:140184) defined on the entire space. This serves as a powerful extension principle.

A classic example is a multiplication operator on a [function space](@entry_id:136890). Consider the operator $T$ defined by the action $(Tf)(t) = t \cdot f(t)$ on the domain of polynomial functions $\mathcal{P}[0,1]$ within the Hilbert space $L^2[0,1]$. The polynomials are dense in $L^2[0,1]$, but they do not constitute the entire space. The operator $T$ as defined is not closed because its domain is not a [closed subspace](@entry_id:267213). However, one can show that $T$ is closable. Its closure, $\overline{T}$, is the multiplication operator defined on the entire space $L^2[0,1]$. Since the function $m(t)=t$ is bounded on $[0,1]$, this extended operator is a [bounded operator](@entry_id:140184). The closure process has thus "completed" the operator, extending its domain from the [dense subspace](@entry_id:261392) of polynomials to the full space [@problem_id:1848460]. A similar principle applies in the context of [sequence spaces](@entry_id:276458). For instance, a [diagonal operator](@entry_id:262993) defined by a bounded sequence, such as $(Tx)_n = \frac{n}{n+1} x_n$, initially defined on the [dense subspace](@entry_id:261392) $c_{00}$ of finitely non-zero sequences in $\ell^2$, has a closure that is a [bounded operator](@entry_id:140184) on all of $\ell^2$ [@problem_id:1848438].

This idea is formalized by one of the most important results in [operator theory](@entry_id:139990). If a [closable operator](@entry_id:271727) $T$ on a Banach space $X$ is such that the domain of its closure, $D(\overline{T})$, is the entire space $X$, then the Closed Graph Theorem implies that the closure $\overline{T}$ must be a [bounded operator](@entry_id:140184). This provides a profound link between the domain of a [closed operator](@entry_id:274252) and its [topological properties](@entry_id:154666) [@problem_id:1848447]. It is worth noting that many [integral operators](@entry_id:187690), such as the Volterra operator on $C[0,1]$, are bounded and defined on the entire space, making them closed and thus trivially closable from the outset [@problem_id:1848475].

#### Defining Unbounded Operators on Natural Domains

The true power of closure becomes apparent when dealing with [unbounded operators](@entry_id:144655), most notably differentiation. The differentiation operator, $D$, defined on the space of polynomials $\mathcal{P}[0,1]$ within the Banach space $C[0,1]$, is an [unbounded operator](@entry_id:146570). It is not closed, as a sequence of polynomials can converge uniformly to a [non-differentiable function](@entry_id:637544). However, $D$ is closable. The domain of its closure, $D(\overline{D})$, consists of all continuous functions that are uniform limits of polynomials $p_n$ for which the sequence of derivatives $p_n'$ also converges uniformly. The action of $\overline{D}$ on such a limit function is precisely the limit of the derivatives. This extends the notion of differentiation to a much larger class of functions, namely the space of continuously differentiable functions $C^1[0,1]$, in a rigorous manner [@problem_id:1848458].

This concept is absolutely central to the modern theory of partial differential equations (PDEs), where solutions are often not smooth in the classical sense. Consider the derivative operator $T_0 f = f'$ on the domain of infinitely differentiable functions with [compact support](@entry_id:276214) in $(0,1)$, denoted $C_c^{\infty}(0,1)$, within the space $L^2(0,1)$. This operator is closable. Its closure, $\overline{T_0}$, is an operator whose domain is precisely the Sobolev space $H_0^1(0,1)$, which consists of functions in $L^2(0,1)$ that have a "[weak derivative](@entry_id:138481)" also in $L^2(0,1)$ and which vanish at the boundaries. The action of $\overline{T_0}$ is this [weak derivative](@entry_id:138481). For example, the function $f(x) = \sin(\pi x)$ is not in the initial domain $C_c^{\infty}(0,1)$, but it lies in the domain of the closure, $H_0^1(0,1)$, and the action of the [closed operator](@entry_id:274252) yields its standard derivative, $\pi \cos(\pi x)$ [@problem_id:2657127]. Thus, the abstract process of taking the closure of a simple [differential operator](@entry_id:202628) on smooth functions formally constructs the Sobolev spaces that are the natural setting for modern PDE theory.

### Applications in Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics provides one of the most compelling arenas for the application of [operator theory](@entry_id:139990). A core postulate of the theory is that [physical observables](@entry_id:154692) (like position, momentum, and energy) are represented by [self-adjoint operators](@entry_id:152188) on a Hilbert space of states. Since many fundamental [observables](@entry_id:267133) correspond to unbounded differential operators, the concepts of dense domains, symmetry, closability, and self-adjointness are not mere technicalities but are at the heart of the theory's mathematical consistency.

#### The Momentum Operator: From Symmetric to Self-Adjoint

The one-dimensional momentum operator, formally given by $P = -i\hbar \frac{d}{dx}$, is a canonical example. To define it rigorously, we must specify a domain. A natural starting point is the dense domain of "very nice" functions, such as the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing functions or the space of smooth functions with [compact support](@entry_id:276214), $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, within the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{R})$.

On such a domain, integration by parts shows that the operator is symmetric, meaning $\langle \psi, P\phi \rangle = \langle P\psi, \phi \rangle$ for all functions $\psi, \phi$ in the domain. This property is crucial as it guarantees that the expectation values of momentum are real numbers, a physical necessity. However, on this restricted domain, the operator is not self-adjoint. The condition for self-adjointness is $P = P^\dagger$, which requires both the operator action and the domains to be identical, i.e., $D(P) = D(P^\dagger)$. For the [momentum operator](@entry_id:151743) $P_0$ defined on $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, its adjoint $P_0^\dagger$ acts as $-i\hbar \frac{d}{dx}$ but on a much larger domain: the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ [@problem_id:2912042].

The initial operator $P_0$ is closable, but it is not closed. The process of finding a physically correct [self-adjoint operator](@entry_id:149601) involves extending $P_0$. The closure of $P_0$ is the first step in this process. For the [momentum operator](@entry_id:151743) on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, its closure is the self-adjoint operator with domain $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ [@problem_id:1848486, @problem_id:2912042].

#### The Laplacian, Hamiltonians, and Boundary Conditions

The Hamiltonian operator, representing energy, for a free particle is proportional to the Laplacian, $H = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\Delta$. When defined on $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the Laplacian is **essentially self-adjoint**. This is a special and important property, meaning its closure is the *unique* [self-adjoint extension](@entry_id:151493). This unique operator corresponds to the physically unambiguous situation of a particle moving freely in space without boundaries [@problem_id:2972806].

The situation changes dramatically for a particle confined to a bounded domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ (a "particle in a box"). The operator $A_0 = -\Delta$ on the domain $C_c^\infty(D)$ is still symmetric and closable, but it is **not** essentially self-adjoint. It admits infinitely many [self-adjoint extensions](@entry_id:264525), each corresponding to a different physical behavior at the boundary $\partial D$. The closure of $A_0$, known as the minimal operator, is symmetric but not self-adjoint. Other [self-adjoint extensions](@entry_id:264525), like the Neumann Laplacian (corresponding to [reflecting boundaries](@entry_id:199812)), exist. The most "natural" extension from the perspective of the initial operator's quadratic form (the Dirichlet energy $\int_D |\nabla u|^2 dx$) is the **Friedrichs extension**. This extension corresponds to the Dirichlet Laplacian, whose domain includes the condition that functions vanish at the boundary. This operator generates the [semigroup](@entry_id:153860) for a Brownian motion that is "killed" upon hitting the boundary. Thus, the abstract choice of a [self-adjoint extension](@entry_id:151493), a process deeply connected to the theory of [closures](@entry_id:747387), directly encodes the physics at the boundary of the system [@problem_id:2972806, @problem_id:2972806].

### Applications in Partial Differential Equations and Harmonic Analysis

As hinted at earlier, the closure of differential operators is the primary tool for defining [weak derivatives](@entry_id:189356) and the Sobolev spaces in which modern PDE theory is formulated.

The domain of the closure of the derivative operator $\frac{d}{dx}$ on $C_c^\infty(0,1)$ is $H_0^1(0,1)$. This provides a rigorous definition of a "derivative" for functions that are not classically differentiable but are limits of [smooth functions](@entry_id:138942) in an appropriate sense. This framework allows us to make sense of and find solutions to differential equations whose solutions lack classical smoothness.

The utility of closure extends to more exotic operators that are central to modern harmonic analysis. The **fractional Laplacian**, $(-\Delta)^{s/2}$, is an operator that generalizes the notion of differentiation to non-integer orders and plays a key role in models involving anomalous diffusion or [long-range interactions](@entry_id:140725). It is most conveniently defined via the Fourier transform, where it acts as multiplication by $|\xi|^{2s}$. To define this operator in the original function space, one typically starts with its action on the Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. This operator is closable, and its closure defines the fractional Laplacian on its natural domain. This domain is the fractional Sobolev space $H^s(\mathbb{R}^n)$, which is characterized by the condition that $\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |\xi|^{2s} |\hat{f}(\xi)|^2 d\xi  \infty$. Again, the abstract closure procedure constructs the precise [function space](@entry_id:136890) required by the theory [@problem_id:1848492].

Furthermore, for problems involving multiple variables, such as PDEs on domains like $[0,1]^2$ or multi-particle quantum systems, operators are constructed via tensor products. For example, the operator $S_0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \otimes I + I \otimes \frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ is the generator for two-dimensional Brownian motion. When defined on a domain of [smooth functions](@entry_id:138942), its closure extends it to the Sobolev space $H^1([0,1]^2)$, allowing it to act on functions that are not continuously differentiable [@problem_id:1849255].

### Applications in Stochastic Analysis

The concept of closure is fundamental to one of the cornerstones of modern probability theory: Malliavin calculus, or the stochastic calculus of variations. This field provides a [differential calculus](@entry_id:175024) on [infinite-dimensional spaces](@entry_id:141268), such as the space of paths of a Brownian motion (Wiener space).

Defining a derivative in this context is highly non-trivial. The standard approach is to first define a derivative operator, $D$, on a small, [dense subset](@entry_id:150508) of "smooth" random variables, known as smooth cylindrical functionals. These are random variables of the form $F = f(W(h_1), \dots, W(h_n))$, where $f$ is an infinitely [differentiable function](@entry_id:144590) and $W(h_i)$ are Gaussian random variables. On this domain, the operator $D$ is defined via a chain rule. This operator, mapping from $L^2(\Omega)$ to a space of Hilbert space-valued random variables $L^2(\Omega; H)$, is closable.

The domain of the closure of $D$ is defined to be the stochastic Sobolev space $\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$. This space is the completion of the smooth cylindrical functionals under the [graph norm](@entry_id:274478). This procedure, relying entirely on the closability of the initially defined operator, provides a rigorous and powerful framework for differentiation of random variables, underpinning integration-by-parts formulas on Wiener space, the analysis of [stochastic partial differential equations](@entry_id:188292), and pricing models in [mathematical finance](@entry_id:187074) [@problem_id:2980970].

### Structural Properties and Operator Calculus

The property of closability is well-behaved with respect to common operator constructions, making it a robust component of [operator theory](@entry_id:139990).

- **Composition:** The composition of a [closable operator](@entry_id:271727) with a [bounded operator](@entry_id:140184) results in another [closable operator](@entry_id:271727). If $T$ is closable and $S$ is bounded, then the operator $ST$ is closable. This allows for the construction of complex models from simpler, well-understood components [@problem_id:1848488].

- **Direct Sums:** If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are closable operators on Hilbert spaces $X$ and $Y$ respectively, their [direct sum](@entry_id:156782) $T_1 \oplus T_2$ is a [closable operator](@entry_id:271727) on the product space $X \times Y$. This is vital for describing compound systems, such as non-interacting multi-particle systems in quantum mechanics [@problem_id:18511].

- **Spectral Theory:** The [spectrum of an operator](@entry_id:272027), which corresponds to physically observable quantities like energy levels, is invariant under closure. The [resolvent set](@entry_id:261708) $\rho(T)$ of a [closable operator](@entry_id:271727) $T$ is identical to the [resolvent set](@entry_id:261708) $\rho(\overline{T})$ of its closure. Moreover, their resolvent operators are the same on this set. This powerful result means that for the purposes of spectral analysis, one may work with either the original, [densely defined operator](@entry_id:264952) or its closure, whichever is more convenient, without altering the physical predictions of the model [@problem_id:1848509].

### Conclusion

The journey through the applications of closable operators reveals that this concept is far from a mere abstraction. It is a fundamental, unifying principle that enables the rigorous mathematical formulation of unbounded processes across a vast range of scientific disciplines. From defining [quantum observables](@entry_id:151505) and their dynamics to constructing the very function spaces in which partial differential equations are solved, the closure of an operator provides the "correct" extension from an idealized domain of [smooth functions](@entry_id:138942) to a more realistic domain that accommodates the complexities of physical and [stochastic systems](@entry_id:187663). It is the essential bridge that connects the elegance of formal differential and integral expressions to the rigorous, functional analytic framework required for modern science.
