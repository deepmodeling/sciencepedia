The range of $T$ is the set of all possible output functions $g(x) = Tf(x)$ for any input function $f(t) \\in C[0,1]$.\n\nThe definition of the operator is:\n$$Tf(x) = \\int_0^1 (x+t+xt) f(t) dt$$\nThe kernel of this integral operator is $k(x,t) = x+t+xt$. We can rewrite this kernel by separating the variables $x$ and $t$. A useful algebraic manipulation is to add and subtract 1:\n$$k(x,t) = 1 + x + t + xt - 1 = (1+x)(1+t) - 1$$\nSubstituting this form of the kernel back into the operator definition:\n$$Tf(x) = \\int_0^1 \\left[ (1+x)(1+t) - 1 \\right] f(t) dt$$\nBy the linearity of the integral, we can split this into two parts:\n$$Tf(x) = \\int_0^1 (1+x)(1+t) f(t) dt - \\int_0^1 f(t) dt$$\nIn the first integral, the term $(1+x)$ does not depend on the integration variable $t$, so we can factor it out of the integral:\n$$Tf(x) = (1+x) \\int_0^1 (1+t) f(t) dt - \\int_0^1 f(t) dt$$\nFor any given function $f \\in C[0,1]$, the two integrals in this expression evaluate to real numbers (constants). Let's define these constants:\n$$C_1 = \\int_0^1 (1+t) f(t) dt$$\n$$C_2 = \\int_0^1 f(t) dt$$\nNow, we can express the output function $Tf(x)$ in terms of these constants:\n$$Tf(x) = C_1 (1+x) - C_2$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$Tf(x) = C_1 + C_1 x - C_2 = (C_1 - C_2) \\cdot 1 + C_1 \\cdot x$$\nThis equation shows that any function in the range of $T$ is a linear combination of the two functions $g_1(x) = 1$ and $g_2(x) = x$. Therefore, the range of $T$ is a subspace of the vector space spanned by the set $\\{1, x\\}$.\n$$\\text{Im}(T) \\subseteq \\text{span}\\{1, x\\}$$\nThe functions $1$ and $x$ are linearly independent on the interval $[0,1]$ because if $a \\cdot 1 + b \\cdot x = 0$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$, setting $x=0$ implies $a=0$, and then setting $x=1$ implies $b=0$. Since the spanning set $\\{1, x\\}$ consists of two linearly independent functions, the dimension of $\\text{span}\\{1, x\\}$ is 2.\nThis implies that $\\dim(\\text{Im}(T)) \\le 2$, so the rank of $T$ is at most 2.\n\nTo determine if the rank is exactly 2, we must check if the range $\\text{Im}(T)$ is equal to $\\text{span}\\{1, x\\}$ or if it is a proper subspace of dimension 0 or 1. We can do this by finding two input functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ such that their images $Tf_1$ and $Tf_2$ are linearly independent.\n\nLet's choose a simple input function, $f_1(t) = 1$.\nThe corresponding constants are:\n$$C_1 = \\int_0^1 (1+t) (1) dt = \\left[t + \\frac{t^2}{2}\\right]_0^1 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n$$C_2 = \\int_0^1 (1) dt = [t]_0^1 = 1$$\nThe output function is:\n$$Tf_1(x) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2} - 1\\right) \\cdot 1 + \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot x = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}x$$\n\nNow let's choose another simple input function, $f_2(t) = t$.\nThe corresponding constants are:\n$$C_1 = \\int_0^1 (1+t) t \\, dt = \\int_0^1 (t+t^2) dt = \\left[\\frac{t^2}{2} + \\frac{t^3}{3}\\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\n$$C_2 = \\int_0^1 t \\, dt = \\left[\\frac{t^2}{2}\\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe output function is:\n$$Tf_2(x) = \\left(\\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot 1 + \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot x = \\frac{2}{6} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot x = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{5}{6}x$$\nWe now have two functions in the range of $T$: $g_1(x) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}x$ and $g_2(x) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{5}{6}x$. These two functions are linearly independent because neither is a scalar multiple of the other. For them to be linearly dependent, there would have to be a constant $k$ such that $g_1(x) = k g_2(x)$. This would require $\\frac{1}{2} = k \\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{3}{2} = k \\frac{5}{6}$. The first equation gives $k = 3/2$, while the second gives $k = (3/2) \\cdot (6/5) = 9/5$. Since these values for $k$ are different, the functions are linearly independent.\n\nSince we have found two linearly independent functions in the range of $T$, the dimension of the range must be at least 2, i.e., $\\dim(\\text{Im}(T)) \\ge 2$.\nCombining our findings, we have $\\dim(\\text{Im}(T)) \\le 2$ and $\\dim(\\text{Im}(T)) \\ge 2$.
