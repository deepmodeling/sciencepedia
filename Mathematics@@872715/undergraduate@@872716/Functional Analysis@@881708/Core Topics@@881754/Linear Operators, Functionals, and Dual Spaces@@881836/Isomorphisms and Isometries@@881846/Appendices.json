The problem statement already establishes that $T$ is a linear operator.\n\n1.  **Continuity of T**\n\nA linear operator between normed spaces is continuous if and only if it is bounded. An operator $T$ is bounded if there exists a constant $M \\ge 0$ such that $\\|T(x)\\|_\\infty \\le M \\|x\\|_\\infty$ for all $x \\in c_0$.\n\nLet's compute the norm of $T(x)$:\n$$ \\|T(x)\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{n \\ge 1} |\\lambda_n x_n| $$\nIf the sequence $(\\lambda_n)$ is bounded, i.e., $(\\lambda_n) \\in \\ell^\\infty$, then there exists a constant $C = \\sup_{n \\ge 1} |\\lambda_n| < \\infty$.\nWe can then write:\n$$ \\|T(x)\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{n \\ge 1} |\\lambda_n x_n| \\le (\\sup_{n \\ge 1} |\\lambda_n|) (\\sup_{n \\ge 1} |x_n|) = C \\|x\\|_\\infty $$\nThis shows that if $(\\lambda_n) \\in \\ell^\\infty$, then $T$ is bounded (and thus continuous).\n\nConversely, if $T$ is bounded, its operator norm $\\|T\\| = \\sup_{\\|x\\|_\\infty = 1} \\|T(x)\\|_\\infty$ must be finite. Consider the standard basis elements $e_k = (0, \\dots, 0, 1, 0, \\dots)$, where the 1 is in the $k$-th position. For each $k$, $e_k \\in c_0$ and $\\|e_k\\|_\\infty = 1$. The action of $T$ on $e_k$ is $T(e_k) = \\lambda_k e_k$, and $\\|T(e_k)\\|_\\infty = |\\lambda_k| \\|e_k\\|_\\infty = |\\lambda_k|$.\nSince $\\|T\\| = \\sup_{\\|x\\|_\\infty = 1} \\|T(x)\\|_\\infty \\ge \\|T(e_k)\\|_\\infty$ for any $k$, we must have $\\|T\\| \\ge |\\lambda_k|$ for all $k$. This implies $\\|T\\| \\ge \\sup_{k \\ge 1} |\\lambda_k|$. If $T$ is bounded, then $\\sup_{k \\ge 1} |\\lambda_k|$ is finite, which means $(\\lambda_n) \\in \\ell^\\infty$.\n\nThus, $T$ is continuous if and only if $(\\lambda_n) \\in \\ell^\\infty$.\n\n2.  **Bijectivity of T**\n\na.  **Injectivity (one-to-one):**\nAn operator is injective if its kernel is trivial, i.e., $\\ker(T) = \\{0\\}$.\nLet $x \\in \\ker(T)$. Then $T(x) = 0$, which means $(\\lambda_n x_n) = (0, 0, \\dots)$.\nThis implies $\\lambda_n x_n = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$. Since we are given that $\\lambda_n \\neq 0$ for all $n$, this forces $x_n = 0$ for all $n$.\nSo, $x = (0, 0, \\dots)$ is the zero vector in $c_0$.\nTherefore, $\\ker(T) = \\{0\\}$, and $T$ is always injective under the given conditions.\n\nb.  **Surjectivity (onto):**\nFor $T$ to be surjective, for any $y = (y_n) \\in c_0$, there must exist an $x = (x_n) \\in c_0$ such that $T(x) = y$.\nThis equation is $(\\lambda_n x_n) = (y_n)$, which we can solve for $x_n$: $x_n = y_n / \\lambda_n$.\nThis defines a sequence $x$. The question is whether this sequence $x$ is in $c_0$ for *every* choice of $y \\in c_0$. We need $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (y_n / \\lambda_n) = 0$.\n\nSuppose the sequence $(1/\\lambda_n)$ is not bounded. This means $\\inf_{n \\ge 1} |\\lambda_n| = 0$. Then we can find a subsequence $(n_k)$ such that $|\\lambda_{n_k}| \\to 0$ as $k \\to \\infty$. Let's construct a sequence $y \\in c_0$. Let $y_{n_k} = \\sqrt{|\\lambda_{n_k}|}$ and $y_n = 0$ for $n$ not in the subsequence $(n_k)$. Since $\\lambda_{n_k} \\to 0$, we have $y_{n_k} \\to 0$, so $y \\in c_0$.\nThe corresponding pre-image would be $x$ with components $x_{n_k} = y_{n_k} / \\lambda_{n_k} = \\sqrt{|\\lambda_{n_k}|} / \\lambda_{n_k}$. The magnitude is $|x_{n_k}| = 1/\\sqrt{|\\lambda_{n_k}|}$. As $k \\to \\infty$, $|\\lambda_{n_k}| \\to 0$, so $|x_{n_k}| \\to \\infty$. Thus, the sequence $x$ is not in $c_0$. This shows that if $(1/\\lambda_n)$ is not bounded, $T$ is not surjective.\n\nNow, suppose the sequence $(1/\\lambda_n)$ is bounded, i.e., $(1/\\lambda_n) \\in \\ell^\\infty$. This means there is a constant $C' = \\sup_{n \\ge 1} |1/\\lambda_n| < \\infty$.\nFor any $y \\in c_0$, consider $x_n=y_n/\\lambda_n$. We have $|x_n| = |y_n|/|\\lambda_n| = |y_n| \\cdot |1/\\lambda_n| \\le C'|y_n|$.\nSince $y \\in c_0$, we know $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} y_n = 0$, which implies $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |y_n| = 0$.\nBy the Squeeze Theorem, since $0 \\le |x_n| \\le C'|y_n|$, we have $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |x_n| = 0$, which means $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = 0$. So, $x \\in c_0$.\nTherefore, $T$ is surjective if and only if $(1/\\lambda_n) \\in \\ell^\\infty$.\n\n3.  **Continuity of T⁻¹**\n\nIf $T$ is bijective, its inverse $T^{-1}: c_0 \\to c_0$ is given by $T^{-1}(y) = (y_n / \\lambda_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$.\nThis is another diagonal operator, let's call it $S$, defined by the sequence $(\\mu_n) = (1/\\lambda_n)$. So $S(y) = (\\mu_n y_n)$.\nFrom our analysis in step 1, the operator $S=T^{-1}$ is continuous if and only if the sequence defining it, $(\\mu_n) = (1/\\lambda_n)$, is an element of $\\ell^\\infty$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n\nFor $T$ to be a topological isomorphism, it must be continuous, and its inverse must exist and be continuous.\n-   Continuity of $T$ requires $(\\lambda_n) \\in \\ell^\\infty$.\n-   Existence and continuity of $T^{-1}$ requires $T$ to be bijective and $T^{-1}$ to be bounded. We found that injectivity is always satisfied. Surjectivity holds if and only if $(1/\\lambda_n) \\in \\ell^\\infty$. The continuity of $T^{-1}$ also holds if and only if $(1/\\lambda_n) \\in \\ell^\\infty$.\n\nCombining these conditions, $T$ is a topological isomorphism on $c_0$ if and only if both $(\\lambda_n) \\in \\ell^\\infty$ and $(1/\\lambda_n) \\in \\ell^\\infty$. This means the sequence $(\\lambda_n)$ must be both bounded and bounded away from zero. This corresponds to option D.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n-   A is not sufficient because it doesn't guarantee surjectivity (e.g., $\\lambda_n = 1/n$).\n-   B is not sufficient because it doesn't guarantee continuity of $T$ (e.g., $\\lambda_n = n$).\n-   C is a sufficient condition, as a sequence converging to a non-zero limit is both bounded and bounded away from zero. However, it is not a necessary condition (e.g., $\\lambda_n = 2 + (-1)^n$ is in $\\ell^\\infty$ and its inverse is in $\\ell^\\infty$, but it doesn't converge).\n-   E describes a scenario where $T$ is not even a well-defined bounded operator from $c_0$ to $c_0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1868057"}]}
