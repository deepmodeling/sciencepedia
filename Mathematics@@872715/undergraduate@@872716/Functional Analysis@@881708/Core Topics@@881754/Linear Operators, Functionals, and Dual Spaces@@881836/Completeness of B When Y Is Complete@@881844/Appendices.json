Therefore, $x^*$ is not in $\\ell^1$.\n\nWe have successfully constructed a Cauchy sequence in $(\\ell^1, \\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$ whose limit exists but is not in $\\ell^1$. This demonstrates that the space is not complete. Hence, $(\\ell^1, \\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$ is not a Banach space.\n\nThis conclusion invalidates option B.
