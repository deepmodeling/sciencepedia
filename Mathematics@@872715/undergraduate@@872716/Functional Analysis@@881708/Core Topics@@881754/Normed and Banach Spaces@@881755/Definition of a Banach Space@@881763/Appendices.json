Is the space $(S, ||\\cdot||_1)$ complete?\n\n**Step 1: Verify if $S$ is a vector space.**\n$S$ is a subset of the vector space $C([0,1])$. We can use the subspace test to check if $S$ is a vector space.\n- The zero function, $z(t) = 0$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$, is continuous and $z(1/2) = 0$. Thus, the zero vector is in $S$, so $S$ is non-empty.\n- Let $f, g \\in S$ and let $\\alpha$ be any real scalar. By definition of $S$, $f(1/2) = 0$ and $g(1/2) = 0$.\n- Consider the linear combination $h = f + \\alpha g$. To check if $h \\in S$, we evaluate it at $t=1/2$:\n$h(1/2) = (f + \\alpha g)(1/2) = f(1/2) + \\alpha g(1/2) = 0 + \\alpha \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nSince $f$ and $g$ are continuous, their linear combination $h$ is also continuous. As $h(1/2)=0$, we have $h \\in S$.\n- Therefore, $S$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, which means it is a vector subspace of $C([0,1])$. So, $S$ is a vector space. This eliminates option (C).\n\n**Step 2: Verify if $||\\cdot||_1$ is a norm.**\nWe check the three properties of a norm for $||f||_1 = \\int_{0}^{1} |f(t)| dt$ on the space $S$.\n- **Positive definiteness:** For any $f \\in S$, $|f(t)| \\ge 0$, so the integral $||f||_1 \\ge 0$. If $||f||_1 = 0$, then $\\int_{0}^{1} |f(t)| dt = 0$. Since $f$ is a continuous function and $|f(t)|$ is non-negative, this equality implies that $|f(t)| = 0$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$. This means $f(t)=0$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$, which is the zero vector in $S$.\n- **Homogeneity:** For any scalar $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $f \\in S$:\n$||\\alpha f||_1 = \\int_{0}^{1} |\\alpha f(t)| dt = \\int_{0}^{1} |\\alpha| |f(t)| dt = |\\alpha| \\int_{0}^{1} |f(t)| dt = |\\alpha| ||f||_1$.\n- **Triangle inequality:** For any $f, g \\in S$:\n$||f+g||_1 = \\int_{0}^{1} |f(t) + g(t)| dt$. By the triangle inequality for real numbers, $|f(t) + g(t)| \\le |f(t)| + |g(t)|$. Integrating both sides gives:\n$\\int_{0}^{1} |f(t) + g(t)| dt \\le \\int_{0}^{1} (|f(t)| + |g(t)|) dt = \\int_{0}^{1} |f(t)| dt + \\int_{0}^{1} |g(t)| dt = ||f||_1 + ||g||_1$.\nAll three properties hold.

For all $n \\ge N$, we have $f_n(t) = 1$.

So, the sequence $(f_n)$ converges to $f$ in the $||\\cdot||_1$ norm.\n\n- Finally, we confirm $(f_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence. For any $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$,\n$$\n||f_m - f_n||_1 = ||(f_m - f) - (f_n - f)||_1 \\le ||f_m - f||_1 + ||f_n - f||_1 = \\frac{1}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2n}\n$$\nFor any $\\epsilon  0$, we can choose $N$ such that for $m,n  N$, $\\frac{1}{2m}  \\epsilon/2$ and $\\frac{1}{2n}  \\epsilon/2$.

By definition, this means the space $(S, ||\\cdot||_1)$ is not complete.\nSince the space is not complete, it cannot be a Banach space. This supports option (D) and eliminates option (A).\n\nConclusion: The space $(S, ||\\cdot||_1)$ is a normed vector space, but it is not complete.
