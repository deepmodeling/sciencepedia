We calculate the norm of a generic element $x_n$ from the sequence. By the definition of the $\\ell^2$ norm and the definition of $x_n$:\n$$\n\\|x_n\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty ((x_n)_k)^2}\n$$\nThe sequence $(x_n)_k$ has only one non-zero component, which is $(x_n)_n = 1$. All other components are 0. Therefore, the sum under the square root simplifies significantly:\n$$\n\\|x_n\\|_2 = \\sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + \\dots + 1^2 + 0^2 + \\dots} = \\sqrt{1^2} = 1\n$$\nThis holds for every $n \\ge 1$. Thus, the sequence of norms is $\\{\\|x_n\\|_2\\}_{n=1}^\\infty = \\{1, 1, 1, \\dots\\}$. This is a constant sequence. A constant sequence always converges to its constant value. So, the sequence of norms $\\{\\|x_n\\|_2\\}$ converges to 1.\nThis finding immediately allows us to eliminate options B and D. Option B states the sequence of norms does not converge, which is false. Option D states the sequence of norms converges to 0, which is also false (it converges to 1). We also rule out E, because for each $n$, $\\|x_n\\|_2 = 1  \\infty$, which means each $x_n$ is indeed an element of $\\ell^2$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the convergence of the sequence of vectors $\\{x_n\\}$. A sequence of vectors $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to a limit vector $x$ in a normed space if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|x_n - x\\|_2 = 0$. If a sequence converges, it must be a Cauchy sequence. A sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence if for any $\\epsilon  0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n  N$, we have $\\|x_n - x_m\\|_2  \\epsilon$. Let's test this condition.\n\nConsider two distinct elements of the sequence, $x_n$ and $x_m$, where $n \\neq m$. Let's compute the distance between them using the $\\ell^2$ norm:\n$$\n\\|x_n - x_m\\|_2^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty ((x_n)_k - (x_m)_k)^2\n$$\nThe vector $x_n - x_m$ has the component $(x_n)_n - (x_m)_n = 1 - 0 = 1$ at the $n$-th position, the component $(x_n)_m - (x_m)_m = 0 - 1 = -1$ at the $m$-th position, and all other components are $0-0=0$. So the sum of squares is:\n$$\n\\|x_n - x_m\\|_2^2 = 1^2 + (-1)^2 = 2\n$$\nTherefore, the distance between any two distinct vectors in the sequence is:\n$$\n\\|x_n - x_m\\|_2 = \\sqrt{2} \\quad \\text{for all } n \\neq m\n$$\nThe distance between any two distinct terms of the sequence is constant and equal to $\\sqrt{2}$. For the sequence to be Cauchy, this distance must become arbitrarily small for sufficiently large $n$ and $m$. However, it is always $\\sqrt{2}$. For example, if we choose $\\epsilon = 1$, we can never find an $N$ such that for $n, m  N$ with $n \\neq m$, $\\|x_n - x_m\\|_2 = \\sqrt{2}  1$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is not a Cauchy sequence.\nIn a complete metric space like $\\ell^2$ (which is a specific example of a Hilbert space, and thus a Banach space), every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence. Since $\\{x_n\\}$ is not a Cauchy sequence, it cannot be a convergent sequence.\n\nSo, we have concluded that the sequence of norms $\\{\\|x_n\\|_2\\}$ converges (to 1), but the sequence of vectors $\\{x_n\\}$ does not converge. This corresponds to statement C.\n\nLet's review the options again:\nA. The sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to the zero vector. False, the sequence does not converge.\nB. The sequence of norms does not converge, but the sequence of vectors converges. False on both counts.\nC. The sequence of norms converges, but the sequence of vectors does not converge. True.\nD. Both the sequence of vectors and the sequence of norms converge to 0. False, the vectors don't converge and the norms converge to 1.\nE. The elements are not in $\\ell^2$.
