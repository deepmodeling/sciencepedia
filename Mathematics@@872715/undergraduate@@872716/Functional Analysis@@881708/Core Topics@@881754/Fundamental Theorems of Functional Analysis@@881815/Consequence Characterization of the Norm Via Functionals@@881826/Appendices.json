The space $\\ell^2$ is a Hilbert space with the inner product $\\langle x, y \\rangle = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} x_n y_n$.\n\nFirst, let's address if $f$ is well-defined. We can view the sum defining $f(x)$ as the inner product of the sequence $x = (x_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ and the sequence $y = (1/n)_{n=1}^\\infty$. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for series states that if $\\sum a_n^2  \\infty$ and $\\sum b_n^2  \\infty$, then the series $\\sum a_n b_n$ converges, and moreover, $|\\sum a_n b_n| \\le (\\sum a_n^2)^{1/2} (\\sum b_n^2)^{1/2}$.\n\nLet $x = (x_n)$ be an arbitrary element of $\\ell^2$.

Since this sum is finite, the sequence $y = (1/n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ is an element of $\\ell^2$.\n\nNow we can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the series defining $f(x)$:\n$$|f(x)| = \\left| \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} x_n \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\right| \\leq \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} x_n^2\\right)^{1/2} \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2}$$\nSubstituting the definitions of the norms and the given series value:\n$$|f(x)| \\leq \\|x\\| \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\right)^{1/2} = \\|x\\| \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{6}}$$\nThis inequality demonstrates two things. First, since the right-hand side is finite for any $x \\in \\ell^2$, the series defining $f(x)$ must converge, so the functional is well-defined. Second, it shows that $f$ is a bounded linear functional, because we have found a constant $M = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{6}}$ such that $|f(x)| \\leq M \\|x\\|$.\n\nBy the definition of the norm of a functional, $\\|f\\|$ is the smallest such $M$.
