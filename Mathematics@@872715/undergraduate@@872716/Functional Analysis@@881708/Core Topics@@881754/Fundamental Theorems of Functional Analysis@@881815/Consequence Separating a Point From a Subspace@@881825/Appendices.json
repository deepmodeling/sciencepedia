The subspace $M$ is a plane passing through the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The equation of the plane is $x + 2y - z = 0$, which can be written as an inner product. A normal vector to this plane is given by the coefficients of $x, y, z$, so we have $n = (1, 2, -1)$.\n\nThe distance from a point $p$ to a plane through the origin defined by $\\langle v, n \\rangle = 0$ is the length of the projection of the vector $p$ onto the normal vector $n$. This distance is given by the formula:\n$$d(p, M) = \\frac{|\\langle p, n \\rangle|}{\\|n\\|_2}$$\nWe compute the terms in this formula. The inner product of $p$ and $n$ is:\n$$\\langle p, n \\rangle = \\langle (1, 1, 1), (1, 2, -1) \\rangle = (1)(1) + (1)(2) + (1)(-1) = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2$$\nThe norm of the normal vector $n$ is:\n$$\\|n\\|_2 = \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = \\sqrt{6}$$\nSubstituting these values into the distance formula gives:\n$$d(p, M) = \\frac{|2|}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{6} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$$\nThis is the first part of our answer.\n\nSecond, we need to find the linear functional $f: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the three given conditions. Since $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with the standard inner product is a Hilbert space, the Riesz Representation Theorem states that any continuous linear functional $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ can be represented by a unique vector $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $f(v) = \\langle v, u \\rangle$ for all $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. Furthermore, the norm of the functional is equal to the norm of this representing vector, $\\|f\\| = \\|u\\|_2$.\n\nWe will use the three conditions to determine the vector $u = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$.\n\nCondition 1: $f(m) = 0$ for all $m \\in M$.\nThis means $\\langle m, u \\rangle = 0$ for all $m$ in the plane $M$. This implies that the vector $u$ must be orthogonal to the subspace $M$. Therefore, $u$ must be parallel to the normal vector $n = (1, 2, -1)$. We can write $u$ as a scalar multiple of $n$:\n$$u = k \\cdot n = k(1, 2, -1) = (k, 2k, -k)$$\nfor some real scalar $k$.\n\nCondition 3: $\\|f\\| = 1$.\nAs stated, $\\|f\\| = \\|u\\|_2$. So we must have $\\|u\\|_2 = 1$.\n$$\\|u\\|_2 = \\|k(1, 2, -1)\\|_2 = |k| \\cdot \\|(1, 2, -1)\\|_2 = |k|\\sqrt{6}$$\nSetting this equal to 1 gives $|k|\\sqrt{6} = 1$, which means $|k| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$.\n\nCondition 2: $f(p) = d(p, M)$.\nWe have $f(p) = \\langle p, u \\rangle$ and $d(p, M) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}$.\n$$f(p) = \\langle (1, 1, 1), (k, 2k, -k) \\rangle = 1(k) + 1(2k) + 1(-k) = k + 2k - k = 2k$$\nSo, we must have $2k = d(p, M) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}$.\nSolving for $k$ gives $k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$.\n\nThis value $k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$ is positive, which is consistent with the requirement $|k| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$ from Condition 3.\nNow we can determine the vector $u$:\n$$u = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} (1, 2, -1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}, \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right)$$\nThe functional $f$ is given by $f(v) = \\langle v, u \\rangle$. For a general vector $v = (x, y, z)$, this is:\n$$f(x, y, z) = \\left\\langle (x, y, z), \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}, \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right) \\right\\rangle = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{6}} + \\frac{2y}{\\sqrt{6}} - \\frac{z}{\\sqrt{6}}$$\n$$f(x, y, z) = \\frac{x + 2y - z}{\\sqrt{6}}$$\nThis is the second part of our answer. We can rationalize the denominator for a cleaner representation: $f(x, y, z) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6}(x+2y-z)$. Both forms are equivalent.
