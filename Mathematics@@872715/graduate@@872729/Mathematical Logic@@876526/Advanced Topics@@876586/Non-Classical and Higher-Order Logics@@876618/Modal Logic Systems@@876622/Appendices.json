This means from world $w$, one can access worlds $a$ and $b$; from world $a$, one can only access world $a$; and from world $b$, one can only access world $b$.\n- The valuation function $V$ for the atomic proposition $p$ is given by $V(p) = \\{a\\}$. This means the proposition $p$ is true only at world $a$. We denote this as $\\mathcal{M},x \\vDash p$ if and only if $x \\in V(p)$.\n- Thus, $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash p$, while $\\mathcal{M}, w \\nvDash p$ and $\\mathcal{M}, b \\nvDash p$.\n\nWe must determine the set of worlds at which the formulas $\\Box p$, $\\Diamond p$, and $\\Box\\Diamond p$ are true. We proceed by applying the standard Kripke truth clauses for the modal operators.\n\n**1. Evaluation of $\\Box p$**\nThe formula $\\Box p$ is true at a world $x \\in W$ if and only if for all worlds $y \\in W$ such that $(x,y) \\in R$, the formula $p$ is true at $y$ (i.e., $\\mathcal{M}, y \\vDash p$). We evaluate this condition for each world in $W$:\n\n- For world $w$: The worlds accessible from $w$ are $\\{a, b\\}$. For $\\mathcal{M}, w \\vDash \\Box p$ to hold, we need both $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash p$ and $\\mathcal{M}, b \\vDash p$. We know $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash p$ is true, but $\\mathcal{M}, b \\vDash p$ is false. Since the condition does not hold for all accessible worlds, we conclude $\\mathcal{M}, w \\nvDash \\Box p$.\n\n- For world $a$: The only world accessible from $a$ is $a$ itself. For $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash \\Box p$ to hold, we need $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash p$. This is true by the given valuation. Therefore, $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash \\Box p$.\n\n- For world $b$: The only world accessible from $b$ is $b$ itself. For $\\mathcal{M}, b \\vDash \\Box p$ to hold, we need $\\mathcal{M}, b \\vDash p$. This is false. Therefore, $\\mathcal{M}, b \\nvDash \\Box p$.\n\nThe set of worlds where $\\Box p$ is true is $\\{a\\}$.\n\n**2. Evaluation of $\\Diamond p$**\nThe formula $\\Diamond p$ is true at a world $x \\in W$ if and only if there exists a world $y \\in W$ such that $(x,y) \\in R$ and $\\mathcal{M}, y \\vDash p$.\n\n- For world $w$: The accessible worlds are $\\{a, b\\}$. We need to check if there exists a world $y \\in \\{a, b\\}$ such that $\\mathcal{M}, y \\vDash p$. Since $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash p$, such a world exists (namely, $a$). Therefore, $\\mathcal{M}, w \\vDash \\Diamond p$.\n\n- For world $a$: The only accessible world is $a$. We need to check if $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash p$. This is true. Therefore, $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash \\Diamond p$.\n\n- For world $b$: The only accessible world is $b$. We need to check if $\\mathcal{M}, b \\vDash p$. This is false. Therefore, there is no accessible world where $p$ is true, so $\\mathcal{M}, b \\nvDash \\Diamond p$.\n\nThe set of worlds where $\\Diamond p$ is true is $\\{w, a\\}$.\n\n**3. Evaluation of $\\Box\\Diamond p$**\nTo evaluate $\\Box\\Diamond p$, we first need the truth set of the inner formula, $\\Diamond p$, which we have just determined to be $\\{w, a\\}$. Let $\\psi = \\Diamond p$. We are evaluating $\\Box\\psi$. The formula $\\Box\\psi$ is true at a world $x$ if, for all worlds $y$ accessible from $x$, $\\psi$ is true at $y$.\n\n- For world $w$: The accessible worlds are $\\{a, b\\}$. For $\\mathcal{M}, w \\vDash \\Box\\Diamond p$ to hold, we need both $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash \\Diamond p$ and $\\mathcal{M}, b \\vDash \\Diamond p$. From our previous step, we know $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash \\Diamond p$ is true, but $\\mathcal{M}, b \\vDash \\Diamond p$ is false. Since the condition does not hold for all accessible worlds, we conclude $\\mathcal{M}, w \\nvDash \\Box\\Diamond p$.\n\n- For world $a$: The only accessible world is $a$. For $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash \\Box\\Diamond p$ to hold, we need $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash \\Diamond p$. We have already established this to be true. Therefore, $\\mathcal{M}, a \\vDash \\Box\\Diamond p$.\n\n- For world $b$: The only accessible world is $b$. For $\\mathcal{M}, b \\vDash \\Box\\Diamond p$ to hold, we need $\\mathcal{M}, b \\vDash \\Diamond p$. We have established this to be false. Therefore, $\\mathcal{M}, b \\nvDash \\Box\\Diamond p$.\n\nThe set of worlds where $\\Box\\Diamond p$ is true is $\\{a\\}$.\n\n**4. Encoding the Results**\nThe problem requires encoding each truth set $S \\subseteq \\{w, a, b\\}$ as an integer using the formula:\n$\\mathrm{code}(S) = b_{w} \\cdot 4 + b_{a} \\cdot 2 + b_{b} \\cdot 1$, where $b_x=1$ if $x \\in S$ and $b_x=0$ otherwise.\n\n- For $\\Box p$, the truth set is $S_1 = \\{a\\}$. The characteristic bits are $(b_w, b_a, b_b) = (0, 1, 0)$.\n$\\mathrm{code}(S_1) = 0 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n\n- For $\\Diamond p$, the truth set is $S_2 = \\{w, a\\}$. The characteristic bits are $(b_w, b_a, b_b) = (1, 1, 0)$.\n$\\mathrm{code}(S_2) = 1 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 4 + 2 = 6$.\n\n- For $\\Box\\Diamond p$, the truth set is $S_3 = \\{a\\}$. The characteristic bits are $(b_w, b_a, b_b) = (0, 1, 0)$.\n$\\mathrm{code}(S_3) = 0 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n\nThe final result is the ordered triple of these integer codes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 6 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2975798"}, {"introduction": "Beyond abstract theory, modal logic is a powerful tool for formal reasoning in fields like philosophy, computer science, and AI safety.

A Kripke model is a pair $(F,V)$ where $V$ is a valuation mapping each propositional variable to a subset of $W$.

This means $z \\notin V(p)$.\n\nFrom condition (1), $(F,V), w \\models \\Diamond \\Box p$, it follows from the definition of $\\Diamond$ that there must exist a world, let's call it $u \\in W$, such that $wRu$ and $(F,V), u \\models \\Box p$.\n\nThe condition $(F,V), u \\models \\Box p$ means that for all worlds $v \\in W$ such that $uRv$, it holds that $(F,V), v \\models p$, i.e., $v \\in V(p)$.\nSince the frame is for system $\\mathrm{S4}$, the relation $R$ is reflexive. Therefore, $uRu$ must hold. From the fact that $(F,V), u \\models \\Box p$, it follows that $u$ itself must satisfy $p$. Thus, $(F,V), u \\models p$, which means $u \\in V(p)$.\n\nFrom our analysis, we have derived the existence of two worlds, $u$ and $z$, both accessible from $w$. For these worlds, we have $u \\in V(p)$ and $z \\notin V(p)$. This implies that $u$ and $z$ must be distinct worlds, i.e., $u \\ne z$.\n\nNow we determine the minimal cardinality of $W$.\n\nCase $|W| = 1$:\nLet $W = \\{w\\}$. As $R$ is reflexive, the only relation is $wRw$.\nTo falsify the formula, we need both $(F,V),w \\models \\Diamond \\Box p$ and $(F,V),w \\not\\models \\Box p$.\nThe condition $(F,V),w \\models \\Diamond \\Box p$ implies that there is a successor of $w$, which can only be $w$ itself, such that $(F,V),w \\models \\Box p$.\nThis leads to the contradiction that we must have both $(F,V),w \\models \\Box p$ and $(F,V),w \\not\\models \\Box p$. Therefore, no counter-model exists with $|W|=1$. The minimal cardinality must be greater than $1$.\n\nCase $|W|=2$:\nLet $W = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$. We attempt to construct a counter-model. Let the world where the formula is falsified be $w_1$.\nFrom the general analysis, we require the existence of two worlds $u$ and $z$ accessible from $w_1$ such that:\n(a) $u \\ne z$\n(b) $u \\models p$\n(c) $z \\not\\models p$\n(d) $u \\models \\Box p$\n\nWe also know from our reasoning that the world $w$ where the formula is falsified cannot be the same as the world $u$ where $\\Box p$ holds. If $w_1 = u$, then $w_1 \\models \\Box p$, which would contradict the requirement that $w_1 \\not\\models \\Box p$. Thus, $w_1 \\ne u$.\nSince we are in a $2$-world frame, and the falsifying world is $w_1$, the world $u$ must be $w_2$. So, $u = w_2$.\nThis requires $w_1 R w_2$.\n\nThe world $z$ must satisfy $w_1 R z$ and $z \\not\\models p$. Since $z \\ne u$ and $u=w_2$, we must have $z \\ne w_2$. The only remaining possibility in our set $W$ is $z = w_1$.\nThis requires $w_1 R w_1$ and $w_1 \\not\\models p$. The relation $w_1 R w_1$ is guaranteed by reflexivity.\n\nSo, the requirements for a $2$-world counter-model are:\n- Worlds: $W = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$.\n- Falsification at $w_1$.\n- Valuation: $w_1 \\not\\models p$ and $w_2 \\models p$. This is achieved by setting $V(p) = \\{w_2\\}$.\n- Relations: $R$ must be reflexive and transitive, and contain $w_1 R w_2$. The minimal such relation is $R = \\{(w_1, w_1), (w_2, w_2), (w_1, w_2)\\}$. This relation is indeed reflexive. For transitivity, we check if for any $(a,b) \\in R$ and $(b,c) \\in R$, we have $(a,c) \\in R$. The only non-trivial case is $(w_1, w_2) \\in R$ and $(w_2, w_2) \\in R$, which must imply $(w_1, w_2) \\in R$. This holds. So, this frame is an $\\mathrm{S4}$ frame.\n\nLet's verify this construction.\n- Frame: $F=(W,R)$ with $W = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$ and $R = \\{(w_1, w_1), (w_2, w_2), (w_1, w_2)\\}$.\n- Model: Let the valuation be $V(p) = \\{w_2\\}$.\n- We check the satisfaction of $\\varphi := \\Diamond \\Box p \\to \\Box p$ at world $w_1$.\n\n1. Check $(F,V), w_1 \\not\\models \\Box p$:\nWe must find a successor of $w_1$ where $p$ is false. The successors of $w_1$ are $w_1$ and $w_2$.\nAt $w_1$, we have $w_1 \\notin V(p)$, so $(F,V), w_1 \\not\\models p$. Since $w_1 R w_1$, we have found a successor where $p$ is false. Thus, $(F,V), w_1 \\not\\models \\Box p$. This condition is satisfied.\n\n2. Check $(F,V), w_1 \\models \\Diamond \\Box p$:\nWe must find a successor of $w_1$ where $\\Box p$ is true. The successors are $w_1$ and $w_2$.\nWe already know $(F,V), w_1 \\not\\models \\Box p$.\nLet's check world $w_2$. $(F,V), w_2 \\models \\Box p$ if for all successors $v$ of $w_2$, $(F,V), v \\models p$. The only successor of $w_2$ is $w_2$ itself. We must check if $(F,V), w_2 \\models p$. Since $w_2 \\in V(p)$, this is true. Thus, $(F,V), w_2 \\models \\Box p$.\nSince $w_1 R w_2$ and $(F,V), w_2 \\models \\Box p$, the condition $(F,V), w_1 \\models \\Diamond \\Box p$ is satisfied.\n\nBoth conditions for falsifying the implication are met.
