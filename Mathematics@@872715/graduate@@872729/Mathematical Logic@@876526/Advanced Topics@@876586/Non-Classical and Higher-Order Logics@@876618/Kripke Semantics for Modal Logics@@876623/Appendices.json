All definitions are standard.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The Kripke model is fully and unambiguously specified. The task is to evaluate a finite set of well-formed formulas at a finite set of worlds using deterministic rules. A unique solution exists.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem statement is formal, precise, and free of any subjective content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** as it is well-posed, scientifically sound, and objective. A detailed solution is provided below.\n\nWe are given the Kripke model $M=(W, R, V)$ with $W=\\{w_0, w_1\\}$, $R=\\{(w_0, w_1)\\}$, and $V(p)=\\{w_1\\}$. We will evaluate the truth of each formula at each world, encoding truth as $1$ and falsehood as $0$.\n\n**Analysis at world $w_0$:**\n\n1.  **$M, w_0 \\vDash p$**: This is true if and only if $w_0 \\in V(p)$. Given $V(p) = \\{w_1\\}$, we see that $w_0 \\notin V(p)$. Thus, the formula is false. Value: $0$.\n\n2.  **$M, w_0 \\vDash \\neg p$**: This is true if and only if it is not the case that $M, w_0 \\vDash p$. Since $M, w_0 \\vDash p$ is false, $M, w_0 \\vDash \\neg p$ is true. Value: $1$.\n\n3.  **$M, w_0 \\vDash \\Box p$**: This is true if and only if for all $u$ such that $(w_0, u) \\in R$, we have $M, u \\vDash p$. The only world accessible from $w_0$ is $w_1$. So we must check if $M, w_1 \\vDash p$. This is true if and only if $w_1 \\in V(p)$. Since $V(p) = \\{w_1\\}$, $w_1 \\in V(p)$ is true. Therefore, $M, w_0 \\vDash \\Box p$ is true. Value: $1$.\n\n4.  **$M, w_0 \\vDash \\Diamond p$**: This is true if and only if there exists a world $u$ such that $(w_0, u) \\in R$ and $M, u \\vDash p$. The world $u=w_1$ satisfies $(w_0, w_1) \\in R$. We have already established that $M, w_1 \\vDash p$ is true. Thus, such a world exists, and $M, w_0 \\vDash \\Diamond p$ is true. Value: $1$.\n\n5.  **$M, w_0 \\vDash \\Box\\Diamond p$**: This is true if and only if for all $u$ such that $(w_0, u) \\in R$, we have $M, u \\vDash \\Diamond p$. The only accessible world is $w_1$. We need to check if $M, w_1 \\vDash \\Diamond p$. This, in turn, is true if and only if there exists a world $v$ with $(w_1, v) \\in R$ such that $M, v \\vDash p$. The relation $R$ is $\\{(w_0, w_1)\\}$, so there are no worlds accessible from $w_1$. The set of such worlds $v$ is empty, so the existential condition cannot be satisfied. Thus, $M, w_1 \\vDash \\Diamond p$ is false. Since the condition $M, u \\vDash \\Diamond p$ fails for $u=w_1$, $M, w_0 \\vDash \\Box\\Diamond p$ is false. Value: $0$.\n\n6.  **$M, w_0 \\vDash \\Diamond\\Box p$**: This is true if and only if there exists a world $u$ such that $(w_0, u) \\in R$ and $M, u \\vDash \\Box p$. The only accessible world is $w_1$. We need to check if $M, w_1 \\vDash \\Box p$. This is true if and only if for all worlds $v$ with $(w_1, v) \\in R$, we have $M, v \\vDash p$. As established, the set of worlds accessible from $w_1$ is empty. A universal quantification over an empty set is vacuously true. Therefore, $M, w_1 \\vDash \\Box p$ is true. Since a world $u=w_1$ exists that is accessible from $w_0$ and at which $\\Box p$ holds, $M, w_0 \\vDash \\Diamond\\Box p$ is true. Value: $1$.\n\nThe sequence of truth values at $w_0$ for $p$, $\\neg p$, $\\Box p$, $\\Diamond p$, $\\Box\\Diamond p$, $\\Diamond\\Box p$ is $(0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1)$.\n\n**Analysis at world $w_1$:**\n\n1.  **$M, w_1 \\vDash p$**: This is true if and only if $w_1 \\in V(p)$. Given $V(p) = \\{w_1\\}$, this is true. Value: $1$.\n\n2.  **$M, w_1 \\vDash \\neg p$**: This is true if and only if it is not the case that $M, w_1 \\vDash p$. Since $M, w_1 \\vDash p$ is true, $M, w_1 \\vDash \\neg p$ is false. Value: $0$.\n\n3.  **$M, w_1 \\vDash \\Box p$**: This is true if and only if for all $u$ such that $(w_1, u) \\in R$, we have $M, u \\vDash p$. There are no worlds accessible from $w_1$. The condition is vacuously true. Thus, $M, w_1 \\vDash \\Box p$ is true. Value: $1$.\n\n4.  **$M, w_1 \\vDash \\Diamond p$**: This is true if and only if there exists a world $u$ such that $(w_1, u) \\in R$ and $M, u \\vDash p$. There are no worlds accessible from $w_1$, so no such $u$ exists. Thus, $M, w_1 \\vDash \\Diamond p$ is false. Value: $0$.\n\n5.  **$M, w_1 \\vDash \\Box\\Diamond p$**: This is true if and only if for all $u$ such that $(w_1, u) \\in R$, we have $M, u \\vDash \\Diamond p$. The set of worlds accessible from $w_1$ is empty, so the condition is vacuously true. Hence, $M, w_1 \\vDash \\Box\\Diamond p$ is true. Value: $1$.\n\n6.  **$M, w_1 \\vDash \\Diamond\\Box p$**: This is true if and only if there exists a world $u$ such that $(w_1, u) \\in R$ and $M, u \\vDash \\Box p$. There are no worlds accessible from $w_1$, so no such $u$ exists. Hence, $M, w_1 \\vDash \\Diamond\\Box p$ is false. Value: $0$.\n\nThe sequence of truth values at $w_1$ for $p$, $\\neg p$, $\\Box p$, $\\Diamond p$, $\\Box\\Diamond p$, $\\Diamond\\Box p$ is $(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)$.\n\nCombining these results in the specified order (sequence for $w_0$ followed by sequence for $w_1$) gives the final $12$-element vector.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\pmatrix{\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\n}\n}\n$$", "id": "2975790"}, {"introduction": "The expressive power of modal logic lies in its ability to describe relational structures.
