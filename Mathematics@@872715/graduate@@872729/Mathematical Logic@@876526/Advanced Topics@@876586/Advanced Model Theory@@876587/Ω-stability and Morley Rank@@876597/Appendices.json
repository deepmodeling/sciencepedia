All premises are factually sound and all terms are well-defined. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe goal is to compute the Morley rank $\\mathrm{RM}(X)$ and Morley degree $\\mathrm{dM}(X)$ of the definable set $X = \\{(x,y) \\in K^2 : y=x^2\\}$, and the Morley rank $\\mathrm{RM}(\\pi(X))$ and Morley degree $\\mathrm{dM}(\\pi(X))$ of its projection $\\pi(X)$, where $\\pi(x,y)=x$. The theory is $T=\\mathrm{ACF}_0$, the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the set $X = \\{(x,y) \\in K^2 : y = x^2\\}$. This set is the graph of the polynomial function $f: K \\to K$ defined by $f(x) = x^2$. Let us consider the map $g: K \\to X$ given by $g(x) = (x, x^2)$. This map is definable in the language of rings, as its graph is the set $\\{(t, (x, y)) \\in K^3 : x=t \\land y=t^2\\}$, which is defined by polynomial equations.\n\nWe demonstrate that $g$ is a bijection between the affine line $K$ and the set $X$.\n1.  Injectivity: Suppose $g(a) = g(b)$ for some $a, b \\in K$. By definition, $(a, a^2) = (b, b^2)$. This implies $a=b$. Thus, $g$ is injective.\n2.  Surjectivity: Let $(x,y)$ be an arbitrary element of $X$. By the definition of $X$, the coordinates must satisfy the equation $y=x^2$. Therefore, $(x,y) = (x, x^2) = g(x)$. This means any element of $X$ is in the image of $g$. Thus, $g$ is surjective onto $X$.\n\nSince $g: K \\to X$ is a definable bijection, and the problem states that definable bijections preserve both Morley rank and Morley degree, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RM}(X) = \\mathrm{RM}(K)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{dM}(X) = \\mathrm{dM}(K)\n$$\nOur task thus reduces to computing the Morley rank and degree of the affine line $K$.\n\nThe theory $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$ admits quantifier elimination. A known consequence of this is that any definable subset of $K$ (in one free variable) is either a finite set or a cofinite set (the complement of a finite set).\nThe Morley rank $\\mathrm{RM}(S)$ of a definable set $S$ is defined inductively. A non-empty set $S$ has $\\mathrm{RM}(S) \\ge 0$. For an integer $n \\ge 0$, $\\mathrm{RM}(S) \\ge n+1$ if there exists an infinite family of pairwise disjoint, non-empty, definable subsets $\\{S_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ of $S$, each with $\\mathrm{RM}(S_i) \\ge n$. A key property is that a definable set has Morley rank $0$ if and only if it is finite.\n\nLet's compute $\\mathrm{RM}(K)$.\n1.  The field $K$ is infinite, so $\\mathrm{RM}(K) > 0$.\n2.  To check if $\\mathrm{RM}(K) \\ge 1$, we need an infinite collection of disjoint non-empty definable subsets $\\{S_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ with $\\mathrm{RM}(S_i) \\ge 0$. We can choose $S_i = \\{c_i\\}$ for an infinite set of distinct constants $c_i \\in K$. Each $\\{c_i\\}$ is a definable set, non-empty, and has $\\mathrm{RM}(\\{c_i\\}) = 0$. This collection satisfies the condition, so $\\mathrm{RM}(K) \\ge 1$.\n3.  To check if $\\mathrm{RM}(K) \\ge 2$, we would need an infinite collection of pairwise disjoint definable subsets $\\{U_j\\}_{j \\in J}$ of $K$ where each $U_j$ has $\\mathrm{RM}(U_j) \\ge 1$. A definable subset of $K$ has Morley rank at least $1$ if and only if it is infinite. In $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$, infinite definable subsets of $K$ are precisely the cofinite sets. Let $U_1 = K \\setminus F_1$ and $U_2 = K \\setminus F_2$ be two such sets, where $F_1$ and $F_2$ are finite. Their intersection is $U_1 \\cap U_2 = K \\setminus (F_1 \\cup F_2)$. Since $F_1 \\cup F_2$ is finite, $U_1 \\cap U_2$ is cofinite and therefore non-empty. Thus, it is impossible to find even two disjoint definable subsets of $K$ both having Morley rank at least $1$.\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{RM}(K)$ cannot be greater than or equal to $2$.\nFrom these points, we conclude that $\\mathrm{RM}(K) = 1$.\n\nNext, we compute the Morley degree $\\mathrm{dM}(K)$. For a set $S$ with $\\mathrm{RM}(S)=n$, the Morley degree $\\mathrm{dM}(S)$ is the maximum integer $d$ such that $S$ can be partitioned into a disjoint union of $d$ definable subsets, each of Morley rank $n$.\nWe found $\\mathrm{RM}(K) = 1$. The Morley degree $\\mathrm{dM}(K)$ is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint definable subsets of $K$, each of rank $1$. As established, any definable subset of $K$ with rank $1$ must be infinite (cofinite), and any two such sets have a non-empty intersection. Therefore, it is impossible to partition $K$ into two or more disjoint subsets of rank $1$. The only such decomposition is the trivial one where $K$ is the single subset.\nThus, the Morley degree is $1$. So, $\\mathrm{dM}(K) = 1$.\n\nCombining these results, we find for the set $X$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RM}(X) = \\mathrm{RM}(K) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{dM}(X) = \\mathrm{dM}(K) = 1\n$$\n\nNow, we analyze the projection $\\pi(X)$. The map $\\pi: K^2 \\to K$ is given by $\\pi(x,y)=x$. The image of $X$ under $\\pi$ is the set:\n$$\n\\pi(X) = \\{x \\in K : \\exists y \\in K, (x,y) \\in X \\}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $X$:\n$$\n\\pi(X) = \\{x \\in K : \\exists y \\in K, y=x^2 \\}\n$$\nFor any element $x$ in the field $K$, its square $x^2$ is also an element of $K$. Therefore, for any $x \\in K$, there exists a $y \\in K$ (namely $y=x^2$) such that the condition is satisfied. This means that the set of such $x$ is the entire field $K$.\n$$\n\\pi(X) = K\n$$\nWe need to compute the Morley rank and degree of $\\pi(X)$, which is equivalent to computing the Morley rank and degree of $K$.

The analysis is conducted within the theory of algebraically closed fields, $\\mathrm{ACF}$.\n\nFirst, we consider the group $G = (K^n, +)$. The underlying set is the affine space $K^n$. As an algebraic set, $K^n$ is the entire space defined by the zero ideal, $(0)$, in the polynomial ring $K[X_1, \\ldots, X_n]$. Since $K$ is a field, the polynomial ring $K[X_1, \\ldots, X_n]$ is an integral domain. The zero ideal in an integral domain is a prime ideal. By the fundamental correspondence between algebraic sets and ideals, a prime ideal defines an irreducible Zariski closed set. Therefore, $K^n$ is an irreducible algebraic set.\n\nAccording to the provided foundational inputs, for an irreducible algebraic set in $\\mathrm{ACF}$, the Morley rank is equal to its Zariski (Krull) dimension.

Justification of $\\Omega$-stability and well-defined Morley Rank.\n\nThe theory $T$ of algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$, denoted $\\text{ACF}_0$, is known to admit quantifier elimination in the language of rings $\\{+, \\cdot, -, 0, 1\\}$. A theory is $\\Omega$-stable if, for any countable set of parameters $A \\subset \\mathfrak{C}$, the set of complete $n$-types over $A$, denoted $S_n(A)$, is countable for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. In $\\text{ACF}_0$, because of quantifier elimination, a type $p \\in S_n(A)$ is uniquely determined by the ideal of polynomials in $A[x_1, \\dots, x_n]$ that a realization of $p$ must satisfy. When $A$ is a countable set, the ring of polynomials $A[x_1, \\dots, x_n]$ is also countable. This implies that the set of ideals, and thus the set of types, is countable. Therefore, $T$ is $\\Omega$-stable.\n\nIn any $\\Omega$-stable theory, every definable set has a well-defined Morley rank ($\\mathrm{RM}$), which is an ordinal (or the symbol $-1$ for the empty set). The rank is defined recursively:\n- $\\mathrm{RM}(Y) \\geq 0$ if and only if $Y \\neq \\emptyset$.\n- For an ordinal $\\alpha$, $\\mathrm{RM}(Y) \\geq \\alpha+1$ if and only if there exists an infinite sequence $\\{Y_i\\}_{i \\in \\omega}$ of pairwise disjoint definable subsets of $Y$ with $\\mathrm{RM}(Y_i) \\geq \\alpha$ for all $i$.\n- For a limit ordinal $\\lambda$, $\\mathrm{RM}(Y) \\geq \\lambda$ if and only if $\\mathrm{RM}(Y) \\geq \\beta$ for all $\\beta  \\lambda$.\n- $\\mathrm{RM}(Y)$ is the supremum of all ordinals $\\alpha$ for which $\\mathrm{RM}(Y) \\geq \\alpha$. By convention, $\\mathrm{RM}(\\emptyset) = -1$.\n\nThe problem states that in the monster model $\\mathfrak{C}$, any definable subset of $\\mathfrak{C}$ is either finite or cofinite. This is a direct consequence of quantifier elimination. For each parameter $a \\in \\mathfrak{C}$, the set $X_a$ is a definable subset of $\\mathfrak{C}$, hence it is either finite or cofinite. We can determine the Morley rank for these two cases.\n\nCase (i): $Y \\subseteq \\mathfrak{C}$ is a non-empty finite definable set.\nAny definable subset of $Y$ must also be finite. A finite set cannot be partitioned into infinitely many non-empty subsets (definable or not). Thus, there cannot be an infinite sequence of disjoint non-empty definable subsets of $Y$. This means $\\mathrm{RM}(Y)$ cannot be $\\geq 1$. As $Y$ is non-empty, $\\mathrm{RM}(Y) \\geq 0$. Therefore, for any non-empty finite definable subset $Y \\subset \\mathfrak{C}$, $\\mathrm{RM}(Y) = 0$.\n\nCase (ii): $Y \\subseteq \\mathfrak{C}$ is an infinite definable set (i.e., cofinite).\nFirst, we determine the rank of the entire field $\\mathfrak{C}$. Since $\\mathfrak{C}$ is non-empty, $\\mathrm{RM}(\\mathfrak{C}) \\geq 0$. We can exhibit an infinite collection of pairwise disjoint, non-empty definable subsets of $\\mathfrak{C}$. For example, consider the singletons $\\{n\\}$ for each integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Each singleton $\\{n\\}$ is definable by the formula $x-n=0$ (where $n$ is short for $1+\\dots+1$). Each $\\{n\\}$ is non-empty and finite, so $\\mathrm{RM}(\\{n\\}) = 0$. The family $\\{\\{n\\}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ is an infinite family of pairwise disjoint definable subsets of $\\mathfrak{C}$, each of rank $\\geq 0$. By the recursive definition, this implies $\\mathrm{RM}(\\mathfrak{C}) \\geq 0+1=1$.\nNow, can $\\mathrm{RM}(\\mathfrak{C}) \\geq 2$? This would require an infinite family of disjoint definable subsets of $\\mathfrak{C}$, each of rank $\\geq 1$. A definable subset of $\\mathfrak{C}$ with rank $\\geq 1$ must be infinite (i.e., cofinite). Let $Y_1, Y_2$ be two cofinite subsets of $\\mathfrak{C}$. Then $Y_1 = \\mathfrak{C} \\setminus F_1$ and $Y_2 = \\mathfrak{C} \\setminus F_2$ for some finite sets $F_1, F_2$. Their intersection is $Y_1 \\cap Y_2 = \\mathfrak{C} \\setminus (F_1 \\cup F_2)$, which is non-empty since $F_1 \\cup F_2$ is finite. Thus, it is impossible to find even two disjoint cofinite subsets of $\\mathfrak{C}$. Therefore, we cannot find an infinite family of them, which means $\\mathrm{RM}(\\mathfrak{C})  2$.\nSince $1 \\leq \\mathrm{RM}(\\mathfrak{C})  2$, and the rank is an ordinal, we must have $\\mathrm{RM}(\\mathfrak{C}) = 1$.\nNow, if $Y$ is any cofinite subset of $\\mathfrak{C}$, then $Y = \\mathfrak{C} \\setminus F$ where $F$ is a finite set. We have $\\mathfrak{C} = Y \\cup F$. Using the property $\\mathrm{RM}(A \\cup B) = \\max(\\mathrm{RM}(A), \\mathrm{RM}(B))$, we get $\\mathrm{RM}(\\mathfrak{C}) = \\max(\\mathrm{RM}(Y), \\mathrm{RM}(F))$. Since $F$ is a finite non-empty set (if $F$ is empty, $Y=\\mathfrak{C}$ and $\\mathrm{RM}(Y)=1$), $\\mathrm{RM}(F)=0$. So, $1 = \\max(\\mathrm{RM}(Y), 0)$, which implies $\\mathrm{RM}(Y)=1$.\n\nIn summary, for any definable set $Y \\subseteq \\mathfrak{C}$: $\\mathrm{RM}(Y) = -1$ if $Y = \\emptyset$, $\\mathrm{RM}(Y) = 0$ if $Y$ is finite and non-empty, and $\\mathrm{RM}(Y) = 1$ if $Y$ is infinite. As each $X_a$ is a definable subset of $\\mathfrak{C}$, its Morley rank is well-defined and must be one of these values.\n\n2. Computation of $\\mathrm{RM}(X_{a})$.\n\nFor each $a \\in \\mathfrak{C}$, the fiber $X_a$ is the set $\\{x \\in \\mathfrak{C} : a \\cdot x \\neq 0\\}$. We analyze this based on the value of the parameter $a$.\n\nCase (i): $a \\neq 0$.\nThe condition is $a \\cdot x \\neq 0$. Since $\\mathfrak{C}$ is a field and $a \\neq 0$, $a$ has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$. We can multiply the inequality by $a^{-1}$ to get $x \\neq 0 \\cdot a^{-1}$, which simplifies to $x \\neq 0$.\nSo, for $a \\neq 0$, the set is $X_a = \\{x \\in \\mathfrak{C} : x \\neq 0\\} = \\mathfrak{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nThis set is the complement of the finite set $\\{0\\}$, so it is a cofinite subset of $\\mathfrak{C}$. As established in the first part, any infinite (cofinite) definable subset of $\\mathfrak{C}$ has Morley rank $1$.\nThus, for all $a \\in \\mathfrak{C}$ with $a \\neq 0$, we have $\\mathrm{RM}(X_a) = 1$.\n\nCase (ii): $a = 0$.\nThe condition is $0 \\cdot x \\neq 0$. This simplifies to the statement $0 \\neq 0$, which is false for any choice of $x \\in \\mathfrak{C}$.\nSo, for $a = 0$, the set is $X_0 = \\{x \\in \\mathfrak{C} : \\text{false}\\} = \\emptyset$.\nBy definition, the Morley rank of the empty set is $-1$.\nThus, for $a = 0$, we have $\\mathrm{RM}(X_0) = -1$.\n\n3. Computation of the drop locus $D$.\n\nThe supremum of the ranks is $r := \\sup\\{\\mathrm{RM}(X_{a}) : a \\in \\mathfrak{C}\\}$.\nFrom part 2, the set of possible rank values is $\\{1, -1\\}$. The supremum of this set is $r = 1$.\n\nThe drop locus is defined as $D := \\{a \\in \\mathfrak{C} : \\mathrm{RM}(X_{a})  r\\}$.\nSubstituting $r=1$, we get $D = \\{a \\in \\mathfrak{C} : \\mathrm{RM}(X_{a})  1\\}$.\nBased on our calculations, the only value of $a$ for which the rank is less than $1$ is $a=0$, where the rank is $-1$. For all other values of $a$, the rank is exactly $1$.\nTherefore, the drop locus is the set $D = \\{0\\}$.\n\nThis set $D$ is a proper subset of $\\mathfrak{C}$ (since $\\mathfrak{C}$ is infinite) and is definable by the formula $a=0$.\nWe are asked to express $D$ as a Zariski closed set, defined by the vanishing of a single polynomial in the parameter $a$. The set $\\{0\\}$ is the zero set of a polynomial $p(a)$ in the variable $a$. The simplest non-zero polynomial that vanishes precisely at $a=0$ is $p(a) = a$.\nThe zero set of this polynomial is $\\{a \\in \\mathfrak{C} : a = 0\\}$, which is exactly the set $D$.\n\nThe polynomial expression whose zero set is $D=\\{0\\}$ is simply $a$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{a}\n$$", "id": "2988700"}]}
