Let $S$ be this set of indices:\n$$\nS \\coloneqq \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} : K_n \\models \\varphi \\}.\n$$\nOur goal is to determine this set $S$ and then check if $S \\in U$.\n\nWe must analyze the truth of $\\varphi$ in each field $K_n$. This requires us to examine the properties of the squaring map on finite fields.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is an even number.\nIn this case, $K_n = \\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$. This is a finite field of characteristic $2$. In any field of characteristic $2$, the map $f(x) = x^2$ is a field homomorphism, known as the Frobenius endomorphism. This is because $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = a^2 + b^2$ and $(ab)^2 = a^2 b^2$. Any field homomorphism is injective. Since $K_n$ is a finite set, an injective map from $K_n$ to itself must also be surjective. Therefore, for every element $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$, there exists a (unique) element $y \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ such that $y^2 = x$. This means the sentence $\\varphi \\equiv \\forall x \\, \\exists y \\, (y^{2} = x)$ is true in $K_n$ for all even $n$.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is an odd number.\nIn this case, $K_n = \\mathbb{F}_{3^n}$. This is a finite field of characteristic $3$, which is an odd prime. Consider a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ where the characteristic is not $2$. The squaring map $s: x \\mapsto x^2$ on the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times$ is a group homomorphism. Its kernel is $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^\\times : x^2 = 1\\}$. Since the characteristic is not $2$, $1 \\neq -1$, and the equation $x^2-1=0$ has exactly two distinct roots, $1$ and $-1$. Thus, the kernel has size $2$. By the first isomorphism theorem for groups, the size of the image of this map (the set of non-zero quadratic residues) is $|\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times| / |\\ker(s)| = (q-1)/2$. Since $n$ is odd, $q = 3^n \\ge 3$, so $(q-1)/2 < q-1$. This shows that the squaring map is not surjective on the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times$. There exist non-zero elements in $K_n$ that do not have a square root in $K_n$. Therefore, the sentence $\\varphi$ is false in $K_n$ for all odd $n$.\n\nCombining these two cases, we can identify the set $S$:\n$$\nS = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} : K_n \\models \\varphi \\} = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} : n \\text{ is even} \\}.\n$$\nThis is precisely the set $E$ defined in the problem statement.\n\nThe problem specifies that the ultrafilter $U$ contains the set $E$. That is, $E \\in U$.\nSince we have found that $S = E$, it follows that $S \\in U$.\n\nBy Łoś's theorem, $K \\models \\varphi$ if and only if $S \\in U$.

This analysis serves to demonstrate that Łoś's theorem, a cornerstone result for ultraproducts, does not generally hold for reduced products over filters that are not ultrafilters. Finally, we must compute a truth indicator $t$.\n\nThe language is $\\mathcal{L} = \\{R, c\\}$, where $R$ is a unary relation symbol and $c$ is a constant symbol. The index set is $I = \\mathbb{N}$.

We consider the reduced product $\\mathcal{M} = \\prod_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathcal{M}_{i} / \\mathcal{F}$. The formula in question is $\\varphi = \\lnot R(c)$. The element $[a]$ is the equivalence class of the constant sequence $a(i) = c^{\\mathcal{M}_i} = 0$ for all $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe interpretation of the constant $c$ in the reduced product $\\mathcal{M}$ is defined as the equivalence class of the sequence of its interpretations in each structure $\\mathcal{M}_i$.\n$$c^{\\mathcal{M}} = [(c^{\\mathcal{M}_i})_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}] = [(0, 0, 0, \\dots)]$$\nThis is precisely the element $[a]$ defined in the problem. Thus, evaluating $\\varphi([a])$ is equivalent to evaluating $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi(c)$, which is $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\lnot R(c)$.\n\nAccording to Tarski's truth definition, for any structure $\\mathcal{A}$ and sentence $\\psi$, $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\lnot \\psi$ if and only if it is not the case that $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\psi$. Applied to our problem, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\lnot R(c)$ if and only if $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models R(c)$.\n\nWe must therefore determine whether $\\mathcal{M} \\models R(c)$ holds. The problem states that the interpretation of relation symbols in the reduced product is defined at the atomic level. For an atomic formula such as $R(c)$, its satisfaction in $\\mathcal{M}$ is defined as:\n$$\\mathcal{M} \\models R(c) \\iff \\{i \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\mathcal{M}_i \\models R(c^{\\mathcal{M}_i})\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}$$\n\nLet's identify the set $S = \\{i \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\mathcal{M}_i \\models R(c^{\\mathcal{M}_i})\\}$. Since $c^{\\mathcal{M}_i} = 0$ for all $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$, this simplifies to:\n$$S = \\{i \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\mathcal{M}_i \\models R(0)\\}$$\nThe condition $\\mathcal{M}_i \\models R(0)$ is equivalent to $0 \\in R^{\\mathcal{M}_i}$. By the definition of the structures $\\mathcal{M}_i$, this holds if and only if $i$ is a perfect square. Assuming $\\mathbb{N}=\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$, the set of perfect squares is $S = \\{k^2 : k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} = \\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, \\dots\\}$.\n\nNow we must check if $S \\in \\mathcal{F}$. A set belongs to the Fréchet filter $\\mathcal{F}$ if and only if its complement in $\\mathbb{N}$ is finite. The complement of $S$ is $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus S$, which is the set of natural numbers that are not perfect squares. This set is clearly infinite. For any integer $n > 1$, the integers $n^2+1, n^2+2, \\dots, n^2+2n$ are all not perfect squares. Since this is true for all $n$, the set $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus S$ is infinite.\nSince $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus S$ is infinite, $S$ does not belong to the filter $\\mathcal{F}$, i.e., $S \\notin \\mathcal{F}$.\n\nBecause the set $\\{i \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\mathcal{M}_i \\models R(c^{\\mathcal{M}_i})\\} = S$ is not in $\\mathcal{F}$, the condition for satisfaction of the atomic formula is not met. Therefore, $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models R(c)$.\nFrom this, by the definition of logical negation, we conclude that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\lnot R(c)$.\nThis means $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi([a])$ is a true statement.\n\nThe problem asks to construct a counterexample to Łoś's theorem for proper filters. Łoś's theorem states that for an ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$, $\\prod \\mathcal{M}_i / \\mathcal{U} \\models \\psi([a])$ if and only if $\\{i : \\mathcal{M}_i \\models \\psi(a(i))\\} \\in \\mathcal{U}$. We have a filter $\\mathcal{F}$ that is not an ultrafilter. We must show that this equivalence fails for our formula $\\varphi$.\n\nWe have already shown that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi([a])$. Now we examine the set on the right side of the equivalence:\nLet $T = \\{i \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\mathcal{M}_i \\models \\varphi(a(i))\\}$.\nSince $\\varphi = \\lnot R(c)$ and $a(i) = c^{\\mathcal{M}_i} = 0$ for all $i$, this set is:\n$$T = \\{i \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\mathcal{M}_i \\models \\lnot R(0)\\}$$\nThe condition $\\mathcal{M}_i \\models \\lnot R(0)$ is true if and only if $\\mathcal{M}_i \\not\\models R(0)$, which means $0 \\notin R^{\\mathcal{M}_i}$.\nBy definition of $R^{\\mathcal{M}_i}$, this occurs precisely when $i$ is not a perfect square. Thus, $T$ is the set of non-perfect squares, which is $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus S$.\nFor $T$ to be in the Fréchet filter $\\mathcal{F}$, its complement $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus T$ must be finite.\nThe complement of $T$ is $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus T = \\mathbb{N} \\setminus (\\mathbb{N} \\setminus S) = S$. As established before, $S$ is the infinite set of perfect squares.\nSince $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus T = S$ is an infinite set, $T$ does not belong to the filter $\\mathcal{F}$, i.e., $T \\notin \\mathcal{F}$.\n\nIn summary:\n1.  $\\prod_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathcal{M}_{i} / \\mathcal{F} \\models \\varphi([a])$ is true.\n2.  $\\{i \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\mathcal{M}_{i} \\models \\varphi(a(i))\\} \\notin \\mathcal{F}$.\n\nThis demonstrates the failure of Łoś's theorem for the reduced product over the Fréchet filter, as the truth of the formula $\\varphi = \\lnot R(c)$ in the reduced product does not correspond to the set of indices where it holds being in the filter. This happens because $\\mathcal{F}$ is not an ultrafilter, and for the set $S$ of perfect squares, neither $S$ nor its complement $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus S$ belongs to $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the truth indicator $t$, defined as:\n$$t = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } \\prod_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathcal{M}_{i} / \\mathcal{F} \\models \\varphi([a]), \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases}$$\nWe have rigorously shown that $\\prod_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathcal{M}_{i} / \\mathcal{F} \\models \\varphi([a])$ is true.\nTherefore, the value of $t$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2973064"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice explores a more complex logical statement within an ultraproduct of familiar algebraic structures, the rings $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$.
