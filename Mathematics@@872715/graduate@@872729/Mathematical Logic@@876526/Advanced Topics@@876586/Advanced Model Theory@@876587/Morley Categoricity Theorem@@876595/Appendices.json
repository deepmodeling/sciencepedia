The language is $\\mathcal{L}_{K} = \\{+, 0, (f_c)_{c \\in K}\\}$, where $f_c$ is the unary function for scalar multiplication by $c$. The theory $T$ is known to admit quantifier elimination. A direct consequence of quantifier elimination is that any definable subset of a model $\\mathfrak{C} \\models T$ is a Boolean combination of affine subspaces.\n\nA critical property of $T$ is that the formula $x=x$ defines a strongly minimal set. That is, any definable subset of the universe $\\mathfrak{C}$ is either finite or cofinite. To see this, consider a formula $\\psi(x)$ in one free variable $x$. By quantifier elimination, $\\psi(x)$ is equivalent to a Boolean combination of atomic formulas of the form $g(x) = 0$, where $g(x)$ is a term. In the language $\\mathcal{L}_K$, any such term is of the form $g(x) = c \\cdot x + v$ for some scalar $c \\in K$ and some parameter $v \\in \\mathfrak{C}$ (built from the constants in the formula).\nThe equation $c \\cdot x + v = 0$ has a unique solution $x = -c^{-1}v$ if $c \\neq 0$, and has no solution (if $v \\neq 0$) or is trivially true (if $v=0$) if $c=0$. Therefore, any atomic formula defines either a singleton set, the empty set, or the entire universe $\\mathfrak{C}$. A Boolean combination of such sets will be either a finite set or a cofinite set (the complement of a finite set). This establishes that $\\mathfrak{C}$ is a strongly minimal set.\n\nBy the foundational definitions of Morley rank and degree, a strongly minimal set has Morley rank $1$ and Morley degree $1$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\operatorname{MR}(\\mathfrak{C}) = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\deg(\\mathfrak{C}) = 1.\n$$\n\nWe are asked to find the Morley rank and degree of the solution set $S = \\varphi(\\mathfrak{C})$ of the homogeneous linear equation\n$$\na_{1} x_{1} + a_{2} x_{2} + \\cdots + a_{n} x_{n} = 0,\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{x} = (x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\mathfrak{C}^n$ and the scalars $a_1, \\dots, a_n \\in K$ are not all zero. The set $S$ is a definable $K$-vector subspace of $\\mathfrak{C}^n$.\n\nSince not all scalars $a_i$ are zero, we may assume without loss of generality that $a_n \\neq 0$. The defining equation of $S$ can then be rewritten to express $x_n$ as a linear combination of the other variables:\n$$\nx_{n} = -a_{n}^{-1} (a_{1} x_{1} + a_{2} x_{2} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} x_{n-1}).\n$$\nThis equation shows that the first $n-1$ coordinates of any vector in $S$ can be chosen freely in $\\mathfrak{C}$, and the $n$-th coordinate is uniquely determined by them. This suggests a bijective correspondence between $S$ and the space $\\mathfrak{C}^{n-1}$.\n\nLet us formalize this.

The map is injective because if two vectors in $S$ have the same first $n-1$ coordinates, their $n$-th coordinates must also be equal by the explicit formula for $x_n$.\n\nThus, $\\pi$ is a definable bijection between $S$ and $\\mathfrak{C}^{n-1}$.

The solution proceeds by connecting the model-theoretic concepts provided in the problem statement to their algebraic counterparts in the context of field theory.\n\n1.  **Interpretation of Model-Theoretic Notions in ACF$_0$**\n\n    The theory $T = \\text{ACF}_0$ is the complete theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$. The language is the language of rings, $\\{+, \\cdot, -, 0, 1\\}$. Any model $M$ of this theory is an algebraically closed field containing the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ as its prime subfield.\n\n    The problem defines a pregeometry on the universe $M$ (denoted as the set $D$) using the model-theoretic algebraic closure operator, $\\operatorname{acl}$. For any subset $A \\subseteq M$, the algebraic closure $\\operatorname{acl}_M(A)$ is the set of all elements in $M$ that belong to a finite set definable with parameters from $A$. In the specific context of $\\text{ACF}_0$, this notion has a well-known algebraic characterization: $\\operatorname{acl}_M(A)$ is precisely the field-theoretic algebraic closure of the subfield generated by $A$ and the prime field $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let us denote this subfield by $\\mathbb{Q}(A)$. Since $M$ is itself algebraically closed, $\\operatorname{acl}_M(A)$ consists of all elements in $M$ that are algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}(A)$.\n\n2.  **Dimension and Algebraic Independence**\n\n    The $D$-dimension of a set $X$, $\\dim_D(X)$, is defined as the cardinality of a maximal subset of $X$ that is independent with respect to the $\\operatorname{acl}$ pregeometry. A set $B \\subseteq M$ is $\\operatorname{acl}$-independent if for every element $b \\in B$, $b \\notin \\operatorname{acl}_M(B \\setminus \\{b\\})$.\n\n    Using the algebraic characterization of $\\operatorname{acl}$ from the previous step, the condition for independence translates to: for every $b \\in B$, $b$ is not algebraic over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(B \\setminus \\{b\\})$. This is the definition of $B$ being an algebraically independent set over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n    Consequently, $\\dim_D(M)$ is the cardinality of a maximal algebraically independent subset of $M$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. In field theory, such a set is called a transcendence basis of the field extension $M/\\mathbb{Q}$. The cardinality of any transcendence basis for a given field extension is an invariant of the extension, known as the transcendence degree, denoted $\\text{tr.deg}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(M)$.\n\n    Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the transcendence degree of $M$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n    $$ \\dim_D(M) = \\text{tr.deg}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(M) $$\n\n3.  **Cardinality of an Algebraically Closed Field**\n\n    Let $\\kappa = \\text{tr.deg}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(M)$. Let $B$ be a transcendence basis of $M$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $|B| = \\kappa$. By definition of a transcendence basis, $M$ is an algebraic extension of the purely transcendental extension $\\mathbb{Q}(B)$. Since $M$ is algebraically closed, it is, up to isomorphism, the algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{Q}(B)$.\n    $$ M \\cong \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}(B)} $$\n    We must now determine the cardinality of $M$, $|M|$, as a function of $\\kappa$. This requires cardinal arithmetic.\n\n    The cardinality of the base field is $|\\mathbb{Q}| = \\aleph_0$.\n    The field of rational functions $\\mathbb{Q}(B)$ consists of ratios of polynomials from $\\mathbb{Q}[B]$. The cardinality of $\\mathbb{Q}(B)$ is thus equal to the cardinality of the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{Q}[B]$. An element of $\\mathbb{Q}[B]$ is a polynomial in a finite number of variables from $B$.\n    \n    We consider two cases for the cardinal $\\kappa$:\n\n    Case 1: $\\kappa$ is a finite integer, $\\kappa = n \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$.\n    In this case, a transcendence basis $B$ has $n$ elements. The field $\\mathbb{Q}(B)$ is the field of rational functions in $n$ variables over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its cardinality is $|\\mathbb{Q}(B)|=|\\mathbb{Q}| = \\aleph_0$. The algebraic closure $M \\cong \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}(B)}$ is the set of roots of polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(B)$. The number of such polynomials is $|\\mathbb{Q}(B)[t]| = \\aleph_0 \\cdot |\\mathbb{Q}(B)| = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$. Since each polynomial has finitely many roots, the cardinality of the algebraic closure is $|M| = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\n    Case 2: $\\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal.\n    In this case, since $\\kappa$ is infinite, the number of finite subsets of $B$ is $|[B]^{\\aleph_0}| = \\kappa$. The cardinality of the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{Q}[B]$ is $|\\mathbb{Q}[B]| = |[B]^{\\aleph_0}| \\cdot |\\mathbb{Q}| = \\kappa \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\kappa$. Thus, the cardinality of the field of rational functions is $|\\mathbb{Q}(B)| = \\kappa$.\n    The algebraic closure $M \\cong \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}(B)}$ is the set of roots of polynomials in $\\mathbb{Q}(B)[t]$. The cardinality of the set of such polynomials is $|\\mathbb{Q}(B)[t]| = |\\mathbb{Q}(B)| \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\kappa \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\kappa$. As each polynomial contributes at most countably many roots, the total cardinality of the algebraic closure is $|M| = \\kappa \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\kappa$.\n\n    In summary, the relationship between the cardinality of the model, $|M|$, and its transcendence degree, $\\kappa$, is:\n    $$ |M| = \\max(\\aleph_0, \\kappa) $$\n\n4.  **Final Derivation**\n\n    The problem states that $|M| = \\lambda$ and that $\\lambda$ is an uncountable cardinal. This means $\\lambda > \\aleph_0$.\n    We have the equation derived from the structure of the field:\n    $$ \\lambda = \\max(\\aleph_0, \\kappa) $$\n    where $\\kappa = \\dim_D(M)$.\n\n    Since $\\lambda$ is uncountable, it is strictly greater than $\\aleph_0$. For the equation to hold, $\\kappa$ must be an infinite cardinal. If $\\kappa$ were finite, $|M|$ would be $\\aleph_0$, contradicting the uncountability of $\\lambda$.\n\n    With $\\kappa$ being an infinite cardinal, the equation simplifies. Since $\\lambda > \\aleph_0$, the maximum of $\\aleph_0$ and $\\kappa$ must be equal to $\\lambda$. This implies $\\kappa \\ge \\lambda$. However, we also have that the transcendence basis $B$ is a subset of $M$, so $\\kappa = |B| \\leq |M| = \\lambda$.\n    The conditions $\\kappa \\geq \\lambda$ and $\\kappa \\leq \\lambda$ together imply $\\kappa = \\lambda$.\n\n    Therefore, the $D$-dimension of $M$ is equal to its cardinality.\n    $$ \\dim_D(M) = \\lambda $$\n\nThe fact that any two uncountable, algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$ with the same cardinality are isomorphic is the substance of the categoricity of ACF$_0$ in uncountable cardinals, a cornerstone result mentioned in the problem preamble.

In a stable theory, the induced pregeometry via algebraic closure $\\operatorname{acl}$ on a strongly minimal set $D$ admits independent sets and bases, and any two bases have the same cardinality (the dimension).\n- In a countable uncountably categorical theory, by the Baldwin–Lachlan analysis, there is a strongly minimal set $D$ such that every model is (up to isomorphism) prime over an independent set $B \\subseteq D$, and the isomorphism type is determined by the dimension data (i.e., the cardinalities of bases for the nonorthogonal strongly minimal types).

In a countable uncountably categorical theory $T$ with a single nonorthogonality class of strongly minimal types, a model prime over a basis $B \\subseteq D$ is determined up to isomorphism by $|B|$, and different values $|B| \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\} \\cup \\{\\aleph_0\\}$ produce (when they occur) distinct countable models, since $\\operatorname{acl}(B)$ is countable in each of these cases.\n\nB. If $T$ is uncountably categorical, then it is also $\\aleph_0$-categorical. Hence there is exactly one isomorphism type of countable model.\n\nC. For Algebraically Closed Fields (ACF) of fixed characteristic, the construction via transcendence bases realizes the scheme above: the model is prime over a transcendence basis $B$, the cardinality $|B|$ classifies the field up to isomorphism, there are countably many nonisomorphic countable algebraically closed fields (one for each $|B| \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\} \\cup \\{\\aleph_0\\}$), and exactly one in each uncountable cardinal.\n\nD.
