Since $\\,L(p)\\,$ is the arithmetization of the length-of-proof function, this property is provable within $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\,$. Specifically, the predicate $\\,\\mathrm{Prf}_{\\mathrm{PA}}(p,y)\\,$ is true only if $\\,p\\,$ codes a valid proof object, and for any such object, its length is at least $\\,1\\,$. Therefore, $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\,$ can prove that any proof has a length of at least $\\,1\\,$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PA}\\vdash\\forall p \\forall y \\big(\\mathrm{Prf}_{\\mathrm{PA}}(p,y) \\rightarrow L(p)\\ge\\overline{1}\\big)\n$$\nInstantiating the universally quantified variable $\\,y\\,$ with the Gödel code $\\,\\ulcorner 0=0\\urcorner\\,$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PA}\\vdash\\forall p \\big(\\mathrm{Prf}_{\\mathrm{PA}}(p,\\ulcorner 0=0\\urcorner) \\rightarrow L(p)\\ge\\overline{1}\\big)\n$$\nThis is logically equivalent to:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PA}\\vdash\\forall p \\neg\\big(\\mathrm{Prf}_{\\mathrm{PA}}(p,\\ulcorner 0=0\\urcorner) \\wedge L(p)<\\overline{1}\\big)\n$$\nThis statement is precisely the negation of $\\,\\varphi_{1}\\,$.

So $\\,\\varphi_{2}\\,$ asserts that there exists a one-line proof of $\\,0=0\\,$.\n\nThe problem states that $\\,0=0\\,$ is a logical axiom instance in the Hilbert system for $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\,$, and that axioms are admissible as one-line proofs. This means a proof of $\\,0=0\\,$ exists which consists of a single line: the axiom $\\,0=0\\,$ itself.\n\nLet $\\,p_{1}\\,$ be the Gödel number of this specific one-line proof. The following are true facts about $\\,p_{1}\\,$:\n1.  The length of the proof coded by $\\,p_{1}\\,$ is $\\,1\\,$.\n2.  $\\,p_{1}\\,$ is a correct $\\,\\mathrm{PA}$-proof of the formula $\\,0=0\\,$.\n\nThe functions/predicates $\\,L(p)\\,$ and $\\,\\mathrm{Prf}_{\\mathrm{PA}}(p,y)\\,$ are primitive recursive and are arithmetized in $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\,$. A key property of the arithmetization of primitive recursive relations in $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\,$ is that for any specific inputs, if the relation is true, $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\,$ proves the corresponding formula.\nThus, for the standard numeral $\\,\\overline{p_1}\\,$ corresponding to $\\,p_1\\,$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PA}\\vdash L(\\overline{p_1}) = \\overline{1}\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\mathrm{PA}\\vdash \\mathrm{Prf}_{\\mathrm{PA}}(\\overline{p_1}, \\ulcorner 0=0\\urcorner)\n$$\nFrom $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\vdash L(\\overline{p_1}) = \\overline{1}\\,$, it follows by the properties of order in $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\,$ that:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PA}\\vdash L(\\overline{p_1}) < \\overline{2}\n$$\nCombining these two provable statements, $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\,$ proves their conjunction:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PA}\\vdash L(\\overline{p_1}) < \\overline{2} \\wedge \\mathrm{Prf}_{\\mathrm{PA}}(\\overline{p_1}, \\ulcorner 0=0\\urcorner)\n$$\nNow, by applying the logical rule of Existential Generalization within $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\,$, we can conclude:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PA}\\vdash\\exists p \\big(L(p)<\\overline{2}\\,\\wedge\\,\\mathrm{Prf}_{\\mathrm{PA}}(p,\\ulcorner 0=0\\urcorner)\\big)\n$$\nThis is precisely a proof of $\\,\\varphi_{2}\\,$.

The complex machinery related to GL is not required for this direct proof, and can be seen as a distraction or a test of identifying the most direct path. An attempt to use this machinery without care can lead to contradictions; for example, if one were to erroneously invoke the general principle of $\\,\\Sigma_{1}$-reflection (which is not on the allowed list) for $\\,\\varphi_1\\,$, one would wrongly conclude $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\vdash\\varphi_1\\,$ via Löb's theorem, contradicting $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\vdash\\neg\\varphi_1\\,$ and implying $\\,\\mathrm{PA}\\,$ is inconsistent.

I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n## PRINCIPLE-BASED DERIVATION\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the connection between the modal fixed point lemma in $GL$ and the arithmetical Diagonal Lemma in $PA$ (and its extensions $T$).\n\nThe modal fixed point lemma guarantees the existence of a sentence $F$ within the logic $GL$ satisfying the equivalence $GL \\vdash F \\leftrightarrow A(\\Box F)$, provided the variable $p$ (for which $F$ is a fixed point) appears only under the scope of $\\Box$ in the formula $A(p)$.\n\nThe arithmetical Diagonal Lemma guarantees for any arithmetical formula $\\psi(x)$ the existence of a sentence $\\theta$ in the language of arithmetic such that the theory $T$ proves the equivalence $T \\vdash \\theta \\leftrightarrow \\psi(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner)$. This is the primary mechanism for constructing self-referential sentences in arithmetic.\n\nThe connection is established via the arithmetical interpretation of the modal language. We seek an arithmetical sentence $\\theta$ that is the counterpart to the modal sentence $F$. The desired arithmetical equivalence should mirror the modal one: $\\theta$ should be provably equivalent in $T$ to the arithmetical translation of $A(\\Box F)$.\n\nLet us formalize this. Under an arithmetical realization (interpretation), let the modal sentence $F$ correspond to the arithmetical sentence $\\theta$. The modal formula $\\Box F$ is then interpreted as the arithmetical sentence $Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner)$. Consequently, the modal formula $A(\\Box F)$ is interpreted as an arithmetical formula, which we denote $\\widehat{A}(Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner))$, where $\\widehat{A}$ represents the translation of the logical structure of $A$ into arithmetic.\n\nThe arithmetical fixed-point equation we want to satisfy is:\n$$T \\vdash \\theta \\leftrightarrow \\widehat{A}(Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner))$$\n\nTo show such a sentence $\\theta$ exists, we define an arithmetical formula with one free variable, $x$. Let this formula be $\\Psi(x) \\equiv \\widehat{A}(Pr_T(x))$. This is a legitimate formula in the language of arithmetic. The arithmetical Diagonal Lemma states that for any such formula $\\Psi(x)$, there must exist a sentence $\\theta$ such that:\n$$T \\vdash \\theta \\leftrightarrow \\Psi(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner)$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\Psi(x)$, we obtain:\n$$T \\vdash \\theta \\leftrightarrow \\widehat{A}(Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner))$$\nThis demonstrates that the arithmetical Diagonal Lemma is the precise tool required to construct the arithmetical analogue of a modal fixed point. The modal lemma guarantees existence in the abstract logic $GL$, while the Diagonal Lemma guarantees the existence of a concrete instance in any sufficiently strong arithmetical theory $T$.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n### Option A\n**Statement:** For every modal formula $A(p)$ in which $p$ occurs only under $\\Box$, there exists a modal sentence $F$ with $GL \\vdash F \\leftrightarrow A(\\Box F)$. Moreover, under the standard arithmetical interpretation into $T$ (using $Pr_T$ and the Hilbert-Bernays derivability conditions), there exists an arithmetical sentence $\\theta$ with $$T \\vdash \\theta \\leftrightarrow \\widehat{A}\\big(Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner)\\big),$$ where $\\widehat{A}$ is the arithmetical translation of $A$.\n\n**Analysis:** The first part of the statement is a correct restatement of the modal fixed point lemma given in the problem. The second part claims the existence of an arithmetical counterpart. As shown in the derivation above, by defining the arithmetical formula $\\Psi(x) \\equiv \\widehat{A}(Pr_T(x))$ and applying the arithmetical Diagonal Lemma to $\\Psi(x)$, we can prove the existence of a sentence $\\theta$ such that $T \\vdash \\theta \\leftrightarrow \\widehat{A}(Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner))$. This statement correctly describes the relationship and the role of the Diagonal Lemma.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Option B\n**Statement:** For $A(p)=\\neg \\Box p$, one can find a modal fixed point $F$ and an arithmetical sentence $\\theta$ such that $$GL \\vdash F \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\Box \\Box F \\quad \\text{and} \\quad T \\vdash \\theta \\leftrightarrow \\neg Pr_T\\big(\\ulcorner Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urCTC) \\urcorner\\big).$$\n\n**Analysis:** This option applies the general principle to the specific case $A(p) = \\neg \\Box p$.\n1.  **Modal Part**: The modal fixed point lemma states $GL \\vdash F \\leftrightarrow A(\\Box F)$. Substituting $A(p) = \\neg \\Box p$, we replace $p$ with $\\Box F$ to get $A(\\Box F) = \\neg \\Box(\\Box F)$. Thus, the modal fixed point equivalence is $GL \\vdash F \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\Box \\Box F$. This part is correct.\n2.  **Arithmetical Part**: We need to find the arithmetical translation of $\\neg \\Box \\Box F$. Let the sentence $F$ be realized as the arithmetical sentence $\\theta$.\n    - The innermost formula is $F$, realized as $\\theta$.\n    - The next layer is $\\Box F$, realized as the sentence $Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner)$. Let's call this sentence $S_1$.\n    - The next layer is $\\Box(\\Box F)$, realized as $Pr_T(\\ulcorner S_1 \\urcorner)$, which is $Pr_T(\\ulcorner Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner) \\urcorner)$.\n    - The full formula is $\\neg \\Box \\Box F$, realized as $\\neg Pr_T(\\ulcorner Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner) \\urcorner)$.\n    The arithmetical fixed-point equation is therefore $T \\vdash \\theta \\leftrightarrow \\neg Pr_T(\\ulcorner Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner) \\urcorner)$. The option provides precisely this equation.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Option C\n**Statement:** In Solovay’s arithmetical soundness, the arithmetical realization $r$ can be chosen to depend on $r(F)$, so the arithmetical Diagonal Lemma is not needed to produce $\\theta$ with $$T \\vdash \\theta \\leftrightarrow \\widehat{A}\\big(Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner)\\big).$$\n\n**Analysis:** This statement claims that the arithmetical Diagonal Lemma is not necessary for constructing the self-referential sentence $\\theta$. This is fundamentally incorrect. The sentence $\\theta$ must be provably equivalent to a formula that contains its own Gödel number, $\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner$. The Diagonal Lemma is the central result in formal arithmetic that guarantees the existence of such self-referential sentences. Any proof of the existence of $\\theta$ must, explicitly or implicitly, rely on the method of diagonalization that underpins the lemma. The phrasing \"the arithmetical realization $r$ can be chosen to depend on $r(F)$\" is an obscure and confusing attempt to suggest an alternative, but it does not represent a valid method for bypassing the need for diagonalization.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n### Option D\n**Statement:** The positivity of occurrences of $p$ is strictly necessary in the modal fixed point lemma; even if $p$ occurs only under $\\Box$, fixed points can fail without positivity.\n\n**Analysis:** This statement is false. The condition for the modal fixed point lemma, as stated in the problem description and in standard literature on provability logic, is that the variable $p$ must be *modalized* (i.e., appear only within the scope of a $\\Box$ operator). The lemma does *not* require that these occurrences be positive (i.e., not under an odd number of negations). A famous counterexample to the claim is the very formula being considered in the problem context: $A(p) = \\neg \\Box p$. Here, $p$ is modalized but occurs negatively. As established in the analysis of option B, a fixed point for this formula exists. The requirement of positive occurrences pertains to a different, simpler version of the fixed point theorem where an explicit form of the fixed point can be given, not to the general existence theorem.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n### Option E\n**Statement:** Starting from a modal fixed point for $A(p)=\\neg p$ and the corresponding arithmetical sentence $\\theta$ with $$T \\vdash \\theta \\leftrightarrow \\neg Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner),$$ one can directly derive Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem by proving $$T \\vdash \\neg Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner).$$\n\n**Analysis:** This statement is flawed for two major reasons.\n1.  **Invalid Premise**: The modal fixed point lemma, as stated, applies only when $p$ is modalized (occurs within $\\Box$). In $A(p) = \\neg p$, $p$ is not modalized. Therefore, one cannot start from the \"modal fixed point for $A(p)=\\neg p$\" using the lemma provided. While the arithmetical sentence $\\theta \\leftrightarrow \\neg Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner)$ (the Gödel sentence, $G$) exists via the Diagonal Lemma, it does not correspond to a modal fixed point in the sense of the lemma given.\n2.  **Incorrect Derivation of G2**: The statement claims G2 is derived by proving $T \\vdash \\neg Pr_T(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner)$. Let $\\theta$ be the Gödel sentence $G$. The equivalence $T \\vdash G \\leftrightarrow \\neg Pr_T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$ holds. Therefore, proving $T \\vdash \\neg Pr_T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$ is equivalent to proving $T \\vdash G$. However, Gödel's *first* incompleteness theorem (G1) states that if $T$ is consistent, then $T \\not\\vdash G$. Thus, the statement proposes deriving G2 by proving something that G1 shows to be unprovable (assuming $T$'s consistency). The actual formal derivation of G2 ($T \\not\\vdash Con(T)$) involves formalizing the proof of G1 inside $T$ to show $T \\vdash Con(T) \\rightarrow G$, from which G2 follows.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2971584"}, {"introduction": "With the bridge between $GL$ and $PA$ established, we can use modal logic as a powerful tool to investigate the structure of arithmetical theories.

The definitions are precise and sufficient to attempt a solution.\n-   **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and devoid of subjectivity.\n-   **No other flaws detected:** The problem is complete, consistent, formalizable, and non-trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Equivalence of $[\\langle n \\rangle \\top]^{*}$ and $Con^{n}(PA)$**\n\nWe are asked to show that for each natural number $n \\geq 1$, the arithmetical sentence $[\\langle n \\rangle \\top]^{*}$ is provably equivalent in $PA$ to $Con^{n}(PA)$. We proceed by induction on $n$.\n\n**Base Case ($n=1$):**\nWe need to show $PA \\vdash [\\langle 1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow Con^{1}(PA)$.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is $[\\langle 1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} = [\\Diamond \\top]^{*}$. According to the given arithmetical interpretation, $[\\Diamond \\varphi]^{*} = \\neg \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner (\\neg \\varphi)^{*} \\urcorner)$.\nLet $\\varphi = \\top$. A standard arithmetical representation for $\\top$ is a simple true statement like $0=0$. Its negation, $\\neg\\top$, is represented by $0 \\neq 0$ or, as is common, $0=1$, which represents falsity ($\\bot$).\nSo, $(\\neg \\top)^{*}$ is the sentence $0=1$.\nThus, $[\\Diamond \\top]^{*} = \\neg \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner)$.\nThe provability predicate $\\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(y)$ is defined as $\\exists p \\, \\operatorname{Proof}_{PA}(p, y)$.\nTherefore, $[\\Diamond \\top]^{*} = \\neg (\\exists p \\, \\operatorname{Proof}_{PA}(p, \\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner))$, which is logically equivalent to $\\forall p \\, \\neg \\operatorname{Proof}_{PA}(p, \\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner)$.\nThis is precisely the definition of $Con(PA)$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is $Con^{1}(PA)$. By definition, $Con^{n+1}(PA) := Con(T_n)$. For $n=0$, this gives $Con^{1}(PA) = Con(T_0)$. Since $T_0 := PA$, we have $Con^{1}(PA) = Con(PA)$.\nThus, LHS and RHS are both identical to $Con(PA)$, so $PA \\vdash [\\langle 1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow Con^{1}(PA)$. The base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nAssume for some $k \\geq 1$ that $PA \\vdash [\\langle k \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow Con^{k}(PA)$.\nWe want to show that $PA \\vdash [\\langle k+1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow Con^{k+1}(PA)$.\n\nLet's analyze the LHS: $[\\langle k+1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} = [\\Diamond (\\langle k \\rangle \\top)]^{*}$.\nUsing the arithmetical interpretation, this is $\\neg \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner (\\neg \\langle k \\rangle \\top)^{*} \\urcorner)$.\nThe translation of negation is standard, so $(\\neg \\langle k \\rangle \\top)^{*} = \\neg ([\\langle k \\rangle \\top]^{*})$.\nBy the inductive hypothesis, $PA \\vdash [\\langle k \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow Con^{k}(PA)$. Since this equivalence is provable in $PA$, $PA$ can also prove the equivalence of their negations and the corresponding provability statements. Therefore,\n$$PA \\vdash \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg ([\\langle k \\rangle \\top]^{*}) \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg Con^{k}(PA) \\urcorner)$$\nThis implies:\n$$PA \\vdash [\\langle k+1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg Con^{k}(PA) \\urcorner)$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the RHS: $Con^{k+1}(PA)$.\nBy definition, $Con^{k+1}(PA) = Con(T_k)$. As will be proven in Part 3, $PA \\vdash Con^{m+1}(PA) \\to Con^{m}(PA)$ for all $m \\ge 0$. This implies that the theories $T_k = PA+Con(T_0)+\\dots+Con(T_{k-1})$ and $PA+Con(T_{k-1})$ are equivalent, since adding $Con(T_{k-1})$ as an axiom allows one to prove all previous consistency statements $Con(T_i)$ for $i<k-1$. Thus, provably in $PA$, $Th(T_k) = Th(PA+Con(T_{k-1}))$.\nTherefore, $PA \\vdash Con(T_k) \\leftrightarrow Con(PA+Con(T_{k-1}))$.\nUsing the problem's notation, this means $PA \\vdash Con^{k+1}(PA) \\leftrightarrow Con(PA+Con^k(PA))$.\n\nA standard result in the metamathematics of arithmetic (formalized deduction theorem) states that for a recursively enumerable theory $S$ and a sentence $\\psi$, $PA \\vdash \\operatorname{Pr}_{S+\\psi}(\\ulcorner \\chi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\operatorname{Pr}_{S}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\to \\chi \\urcorner)$. Setting $S=PA$ and $\\chi=\\bot$, we get $\\operatorname{Pr}_{PA+\\psi}(\\ulcorner \\bot \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\to \\bot \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg \\psi \\urcorner)$.\nTaking the negation of both sides gives $Con(PA+\\psi) \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg \\psi \\urcorner)$.\nLetting $\\psi = Con^k(PA)$, we have:\n$$PA \\vdash Con(PA+Con^k(PA)) \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg Con^k(PA) \\urcorner)$$\nCombining our findings for the RHS, we have:\n$$PA \\vdash Con^{k+1}(PA) \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg Con^{k}(PA) \\urcorner)$$\nComparing the equivalences for the LHS and RHS, we conclude that $PA \\vdash [\\langle k+1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow Con^{k+1}(PA)$.\nThe induction is complete.\n\n**Part 2: Arithmetical Hierarchy Classification**\n\nWe need to determine the classification of the sentence $Con^n(PA)$ in the arithmetical hierarchy ($\\Sigma^0_k, \\Pi^0_k$) for a fixed $n \\geq 1$.\nThe arithmetical hierarchy classifies formulas based on the alternation of unbounded quantifiers, assuming the quantifier-free part is recursive. A formula is $\\Pi_k^0$ if it is of the form $\\forall x_1 \\exists x_2 \\dots Q x_k R(\\dots)$ with $R$ recursive, and $\\Sigma_k^0$ if it starts with $\\exists$.\n\nConsider $Con^1(PA) = Con(PA) = \\forall p \\, \\neg \\operatorname{Proof}_{PA}(p, \\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner)$.\nThe set of axioms of $PA$ is recursive. The relation $\\operatorname{Proof}_{PA}(p,y)$, which states that $p$ is the Gödel number of a valid proof in $PA$ of the formula with Gödel number $y$, is therefore a primitive recursive relation. A primitive recursive relation is decided by an algorithm that always halts, and its defining logical formula is $\\Delta_1^0$ (equivalent to both a $\\Sigma_1^0$ and a $\\Pi_1^0$ formula). Let's denote the recursive kernel by $R(p,y)$.\nThus, $Con(PA)$ has the form $\\forall p \\, \\neg R(p, \\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner)$. This is a universal quantifier over a recursive predicate, which by definition is a $\\Pi_1^0$ formula.\n\nNow consider $Con^n(PA)$ for an arbitrary fixed $n > 1$.\n$Con^n(PA) = Con(T_{n-1})$.\nThe theory $T_{n-1}$ is defined by the progression $T_0 = PA$, $T_{k+1} = T_k + Con(T_k)$.\nFor any fixed $n$, the theory $T_{n-1}$ is $PA$ augmented with a finite number of axioms: $Con(T_0), Con(T_1), \\dots, Con(T_{n-2})$.\nLet $A_k$ be the axiom set of $T_k$. Then $A_k = A_{k-1} \\cup \\{ Con(T_{k-1}) \\}$.\nFor any given formula $\\phi$, one can algorithmically decide if it belongs to this set: check if it is an axiom of $PA$ (recursive check), or if it is one of the finitely many sentences $Con(T_0), \\dots, Con(T_{n-2})$. Since $n$ is fixed, this is a finite list of sentences to check against.\nTherefore, for any fixed $n$, the axiom set of $T_{n-1}$ is a recursive set.\n\nSince $T_{n-1}$ has a recursive set of axioms, the proof predicate $\\operatorname{Proof}_{T_{n-1}}(p,y)$ is a recursive relation, just as in the case for $PA$.\nThe sentence $Con^{n}(PA) = Con(T_{n-1})$ is defined as:\n$$Con(T_{n-1}) := \\forall p \\, \\neg \\operatorname{Proof}_{T_{n-1}}\\!\\left(p, \\ulcorner 0 = 1 \\urcorner\\right)$$\nThis formula consists of a single universal quantifier over a recursive predicate. Hence, for any fixed $n \\geq 1$, the sentence $Con^n(PA)$ is a $\\Pi_1^0$ sentence. While this might seem counter-intuitive to the idea of the Turing progression generating ever-more-complex statements of unprovability, it is the direct consequence of the definitions provided and standard hierarchy classification. The complexity increase in the Turing progression is often discussed in terms of the strength of the theories or non-uniform complexity, but for a fixed $n$, the syntactic form of the standard consistency statement remains $\\Pi_1^0$.\n\n**Part 3: Monotonicity of Iterated Consistency**\n\nWe need to prove in $PA$ that for every $n \\geq 0$, $Con^{n+1}(PA) \\to Con^{n}(PA)$.\n\nCase $n=0$: We must show $PA \\vdash Con^{1}(PA) \\to Con^{0}(PA)$.\nBy definition, $Con^{1}(PA) = Con(PA)$ and $Con^{0}(PA) = \\top$. The statement is $PA \\vdash Con(PA) \\to \\top$. This is an instance of the logical tautology $A \\to \\top$, which is provable in any standard logical system, including the one underlying $PA$.\n\nCase $n \\geq 1$: We must show $PA \\vdash Con^{n+1}(PA) \\to Con^{n}(PA)$.\nBy definition, $Con^{n+1}(PA) = Con(T_n)$ and $Con^{n}(PA) = Con(T_{n-1})$. So we need to show $PA \\vdash Con(T_n) \\to Con(T_{n-1})$.\n\nThe theory $T_n$ is defined as $T_{n-1} + Con(T_{n-1})$. This means the set of axioms of $T_{n-1}$ is a subset of the set of axioms of $T_n$.\nAny proof in $T_{n-1}$ is also a valid proof in $T_n$.\nThis implies that any sentence provable in $T_{n-1}$ is also provable in $T_n$.\nThis reasoning can be formalized within $PA$. Let $Pr_{S}(\\ulcorner\\phi\\urcorner)$ be the formula asserting that $\\phi$ is provable in theory $S$. The inclusion of axiom sets implies:\n$$PA \\vdash Pr_{T_{n-1}}(\\ulcorner\\phi\\urcorner) \\to Pr_{T_n}(\\ulcorner\\phi\\urcorner)$$\nfor any sentence $\\phi$. Let us set $\\phi$ to be the sentence for falsity, $0=1$.\n$$PA \\vdash Pr_{T_{n-1}}(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner) \\to Pr_{T_n}(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner)$$\nBy taking the contrapositive of this implication within PA's logic, we get:\n$$PA \\vdash \\neg Pr_{T_n}(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner) \\to \\neg Pr_{T_{n-1}}(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner)$$\nBy the definition of the consistency operator $Con(\\cdot)$, this is precisely:\n$$PA \\vdash Con(T_n) \\to Con(T_{n-1})$$\nSubstituting the definitions for iterated consistency:\n$$PA \\vdash Con^{n+1}(PA) \\to Con^{n}(PA)$$\nThis holds for all $n \\geq 1$. Combining with the $n=0$ case, the property is proven for all $n \\geq 0$.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe problem asks for the hierarchy class computed in Part 2. As demonstrated, for any fixed $n \\geq 1$, the sentence $Con^n(PA)$ is a $\\Pi_1^0$ sentence. The symbolic expression for this class is $\\Pi_1^0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\Pi^{0}_{1}}$$", "id": "2980183"}]}
