The validation process confirms the problem is valid, well-posed, and grounded in established mathematical principles. We will now proceed with a detailed analysis of each option.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\nThe statement claims that for every total computable function $f \\colon \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$, there exists a term $t_f(x)$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}_A = \\{0, S, +, \\times, \\}$ that represents the function. A term in $\\mathcal{L}_A$ involving a free variable $x$ is constructed from $x$, the constant $0$, and the function symbols $S$, $+$, and $\\times$. When interpreted in the standard model of arithmetic $\\mathbb{N}$, any such term defines a polynomial function with non-negative integer coefficients. For example, the term $(x \\times x) + S(S(0))$ corresponds to the function $p(n) = n^2 + 2$.\n\nThe set of total computable functions is a much larger class than the set of polynomials. For instance, the exponential function $f(n) = 2^n$ is a well-known primitive recursive (and therefore total computable) function. However, it is not a polynomial, and thus there is no term $t(x)$ in $\\mathcal{L}_A$ that represents it. Consequently, the first part of the statement is false.\n\nThe second part of the statement, \"$Q$ proves $\\forall x \\, \\big(t_{f}(x) = \\overline{f(x)}\\big)$\", is syntactically ill-formed. The expression $\\overline{f(x)}$ is not a valid term in $\\mathcal{L}_A$; the overline notation $\\overline{n}$ applies to a specific natural number $n$ from the metatheory to produce a specific term, not to a function of a formal variable $x$. The standard way to express function properties is through representing formulas, not terms.\n\nBecause not all total computable functions are representable by terms in $\\mathcal{L}_A$, the statement is fundamentally incorrect.\n\nVerdict for A: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nThis statement consists of two claims.\n\nFirst, \"There exists a primitive recursive function $\\mathrm{num} \\colon \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ that outputs the Gödel code of the numeral $\\overline{n}$\". A numeral $\\overline{n}$ is the term $S(S(\\dots S(0)\\dots))$ with $n$ applications of the successor symbol $S$. Let $\\ulcorner \\cdot \\urcorner$ denote the Gödel numbering function. The function $\\mathrm{num}(n) = \\ulcorner \\overline{n} \\urcorner$ can be defined by primitive recursion:\n- Base case: $\\mathrm{num}(0) = \\ulcorner 0 \\urcorner$, which is a specific constant.\n- Recursive step: $\\mathrm{num}(n+1) = \\ulcorner S(\\overline{n}) \\urcorner$. The Gödel code of the term $S(t)$ is a primitive recursive function of the Gödel code of the term $t$. For instance, a common Gödel scheme might define $\\ulcorner S(t) \\urcorner = 2^{\\ulcorner S \\urcorner} \\cdot 3^{\\ulcorner (\\urcorner} \\cdot 5^{\\ulcorner t \\urcorner} \\cdot 7^{\\ulcorner) \\urcorner}$. All operations involved (exponentiation, multiplication) are primitive recursive. Thus, $\\mathrm{num}(n+1)$ is a primitive recursive function of $\\mathrm{num}(n)$. This structure fits the definition of a primitive recursive function.\n\nSecond, \"...consequently the substitution function $\\mathrm{Sub}(x,y)$ that returns the Gödel code of the result of substituting the numeral $\\overline{y}$ for a fixed free variable in the formula coded by $x$ is primitive recursive.\" Let the fixed variable be $v_0$. The general substitution function, $\\mathrm{subst}(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner, \\ulcorner v \\urcorner, \\ulcorner \\tau \\urcorner)$, which computes the Gödel code of $\\phi(\\tau/v)$, is known to be primitive recursive. This is a cornerstone of the arithmetization of syntax. The function in the statement, $\\mathrm{Sub}(x, y)$, can be defined as $\\mathrm{Sub}(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner, n) = \\mathrm{subst}(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner, \\ulcorner v_0 \\urcorner, \\ulcorner \\overline{n} \\urcorner) = \\mathrm{subst}(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner, \\ulcorner v_0 \\urcorner, \\mathrm{num}(n))$. Since $\\mathrm{subst}$ and $\\mathrm{num}$ are primitive recursive, and the class of primitive recursive functions is closed under composition, $\\mathrm{Sub}$ is also primitive recursive.\n\nBoth claims are standard and correct results in recursion theory.\n\nVerdict for B: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\nThis statement makes two claims about Rosser's strengthening of Gödel's theorem.\n\nFirst, \"Rosser's argument avoids any use of numerals by quantifying over proof objects as sets, thereby requiring second-order arithmetic...\". This is incorrect on multiple levels. Rosser's argument is a first-order argument, formalizable in weak first-order theories like $Q$. It quantifies over the Gödel numbers of proofs, which are natural numbers, not sets. The Rosser sentence $R$ is equivalent to the formal statement, \"For any proof of $R$, there exists a proof of $\\neg R$ with a smaller Gödel number.\" This is formalized as $\\forall y (\\mathrm{Proof}(y, \\ulcorner R \\urcorner) \\to \\exists z (z  y \\wedge \\mathrm{Proof}(z, \\ulcorner \\mathrm{neg}(\\ulcorner R \\urcorner) \\urcorner)))$. Here, $y$ and $z$ are variables ranging over natural numbers. Furthermore, the construction of the sentence $R$ itself relies on the Fixed-Point Lemma, which explicitly uses a numeral $\\overline{\\ulcorner R_{form} \\urcorner}$ to achieve self-reference, where $R_{form}$ is a formula with one free variable. Numerals are thus essential, not avoided.\n\nSecond, \"...moreover, the ordering relation $$ on proof codes cannot be represented in $Q$.\" This is also false. Proof codes are natural numbers. The ordering relation $$ on natural numbers is directly part of the language $\\mathcal{L}_A$. A key property of Robinson's Arithmetic $Q$ is that for any two natural numbers $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, if $m  n$ then $Q \\vdash \\overline{m}  \\overline{n}$, and if $m \\not n$ then $Q \\vdash \\neg(\\overline{m}  \\overline{n})$. This means the standard ordering relation is decidable in $Q$ for any pair of numerals, which is a form of representability sufficient for Rosser's proof.\n\nBoth claims in the statement are incorrect.\n\nVerdict for C: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThis statement makes two related claims.\n\nFirst, \"The evaluation of closed $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-terms in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$ is primitive recursive in the Gödel code of the term...\". A closed term in $\\mathcal{L}_A$ is built from $0$ using $S$, $+$, and $\\times$. We can define a function $\\mathrm{eval}(\\ulcorner \\tau \\urcorner)$ that computes the value of the closed term $\\tau$. This function is defined by recursion on the structure of the term, which can be implemented as a primitive recursion on the Gödel number. For example, $\\mathrm{eval}(\\ulcorner \\tau_1 + \\tau_2 \\urcorner) = \\mathrm{eval}(\\ulcorner \\tau_1 \\urcorner) + \\mathrm{eval}(\\ulcorner \\tau_2 \\urcorner)$. The parsing of the Gödel number $\\ulcorner \\tau_1 + \\tau_2 \\urcorner$ into its constituent parts $\\ulcorner \\tau_1 \\urcorner$ and $\\ulcorner \\tau_2 \\urcorner$ is a primitive recursive operation. This makes the $\\mathrm{eval}$ function itself primitive recursive. This is a standard result.\n\nSecond, \"...and for each closed term $\\tau$, $Q$ proves the specific equality $\\tau = \\overline{n}$ where $n$ is the value of $\\tau$ in $\\mathbb{N}$.\" This is a fundamental property of Robinson Arithmetic $Q$. While $Q$ is a very weak theory (it lacks induction for general formulas), its axioms for $S, +, \\times$ are sufficient to prove any specific numerical identity. This can be demonstrated by a meta-theoretic induction on the complexity of the closed term $\\tau$. For example, if $Q \\vdash \\tau_1 = \\overline{n_1}$ and $Q \\vdash \\tau_2 = \\overline{n_2}$, then the axioms of $Q$ are strong enough to prove $\\overline{n_1} + \\overline{n_2} = \\overline{n_1+n_2}$, and therefore $Q \\vdash \\tau_1 + \\tau_2 = \\overline{n_1+n_2}$. This property ensures that $Q$ can \"compute\" the value of any closed term.\n\nBoth parts of the statement are correct and crucial for the role of $Q$ as a base theory for incompleteness.\n\nVerdict for D: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\n\nThis statement describes the Gödel fixed-point construction, also known as the Diagonal Lemma. The lemma states that for any formula $\\varphi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in a sufficiently strong theory $T$ (like $Q$), there exists a sentence $G$ such that $T \\vdash G \\leftrightarrow \\varphi(\\overline{\\ulcorner G \\urcorner})$. The statement accurately reflects this result.\n\nThe construction of $G$ involves arithmetizing the act of substitution. A formula $\\theta(z)$ is constructed which effectively says \"the formula resulting from substituting the numeral of $z$ into the formula with Gödel number $z$ satisfies $\\varphi$\". The sentence $G$ is then defined as $\\theta(\\overline{k})$, where $k = \\ulcorner \\theta(z) \\urcorner$. The theory $T$ is then able to prove that $G$ is equivalent to $\\varphi(\\overline{\\ulcorner G \\urcorner})$.\n\nThe statement correctly highlights that this construction \"explicitly [relies] on the fact that numerals are terms of $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$ that denote the standard natural numbers used in the self-reference.\" This is the core of the technique: the syntax has a way to refer to specific numbers (via numerals), and numbers can be used to code syntax (via Gödel numbering). The substitution of the numeral $\\overline{\\ulcorner G \\urcorner}$ for the variable $x$ in the formula $\\varphi(x)$ is the linchpin that creates the self-reference. The numeral is the syntactic object within the formal language that bridges the gap between the formula $G$ and its own code $\\ulcorner G \\urcorner$.\n\nThe statement is a correct and insightful summary of the Fixed-Point Lemma and the role of numerals within it.\n\nVerdict for E: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BDE}$$", "id": "2973587"}, {"introduction": "Once the machinery for self-reference is in place, we can construct sentences that assert their own unprovability.

For any recursively axiomatizable extension $T$ of $Q$ that is consistent, both $R_T$ and $\\neg R_T$ are unprovable in $T$, whereas showing the unprovability of $\\neg G_T$ for $G_T$ in general uses a hypothesis stronger than mere consistency (such as $\\omega$-consistency).**\n\nThis statement accurately captures the essence of Rosser's strengthening of Gödel's first incompleteness theorem.\n1.  **Rosser's Theorem:** This theorem states that for any consistent, recursively axiomatizable, and sufficiently strong theory $T$, both the Rosser sentence $R_T$ and its negation $\\neg R_T$ are unprovable in $T$. The proof relies only on the consistency of $T$.\n2.  **Gödel's Theorem:** Showing $T \\not\\vdash G_T$ requires only that $T$ is consistent. The argument is as follows: if $T \\vdash G_T$, then there is a proof of $G_T$, so $\\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$ is a true $\\Sigma_1^0$ sentence. Since $T$ is sufficiently strong, $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. However, by definition, $T \\vdash G_T \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$, so $T \\vdash \\neg \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. Thus $T$ is inconsistent.\n    However, to show $T \\not\\vdash \\neg G_T$, one needs a stronger assumption. If $T \\vdash \\neg G_T$, then $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$, i.e., $T \\vdash \\exists x \\operatorname{Prf}_T(x, \\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. But if $T$ is consistent, it does not prove $G_T$, so for every standard numeral $\\overline{n}$, $\\neg \\operatorname{Prf}_T(\\overline{n},\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$ is true, and since this is a true primitive recursive statement, $T \\vdash \\neg \\operatorname{Prf}_T(\\overline{n},\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. Thus, we have $T \\vdash \\exists x \\operatorname{Prf}_T(x, \\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$ and for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $T \\vdash \\neg \\operatorname{Prf}_T(\\overline{n}, \\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. This configuration is a direct violation of $\\omega$-consistency. Therefore, if $T$ is $\\omega$-consistent, then $T \\not\\vdash \\neg G_T$. Mere consistency is insufficient, as there exist consistent but $\\omega$-inconsistent theories that do prove $\\neg G_T$.\n\nThe statement is a correct summary of these fundamental results.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The Gödel sentence $G_T$ is logically equivalent in $T$ to a sentence of the arithmetical class $\\Pi_1^0$, but any Rosser sentence $R_T$ must have arithmetical complexity strictly above $\\Pi_1^0$ (for example $\\Pi_2^0$), due to the comparison of proof codes.**\n\nThe first part of the statement is correct; as shown in the preliminaries, $G_T$ is a $\\Pi_1^0$ sentence. However, the second part is incorrect. As also shown, the formula for $R_T$ is $\\forall x\\, \\neg \\mathbf{RPrf}_T(x, \\ulcorner R_T \\urcorner)$, where $\\mathbf{RPrf}_T(x,y)$ is a $\\Delta_0$ formula. The \"comparison of proof codes\" is handled by a bounded quantifier ($\\forall z  x$), which does not increase the complexity beyond $\\Delta_0$. Therefore, $R_T$ is also a $\\Pi_1^0$ sentence.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Rosser's strengthening relies on the Hilbert–Bernays derivability conditions (HB) for the provability predicate of $T$ in order to eliminate $\\omega$-consistency, while Gödel's original argument does not require them.**\n\nThis statement misattributes the use of the Hilbert-Bernays (HB) conditions. The proofs of the first incompleteness theorem, both Gödel's and Rosser's versions (i.e., the unprovability of $G_T$, $R_T$, and their negations under appropriate conditions), primarily rely on the representability of all primitive recursive relations in $T$. The full HB conditions, particularly $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\urcorner)$, are essential for the proof of Gödel's *second* incompleteness theorem (the unprovability of the consistency statement, $\\operatorname{Con}(T)$). Neither Gödel's first theorem nor Rosser's strengthening requires these conditions.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If $T$ is merely consistent but not $1$-consistent, it is possible that $T \\vdash \\neg G_T$; however, for the Rosser sentence $R_T$, mere consistency suffices to rule out both $T \\vdash R_T$ and $T \\vdash \\neg R_T$.**\n\nThis statement is a more precise version of statement A.\n1.  **Possibility of $T \\vdash \\neg G_T$**: A theory $T$ is $1$-consistent if it proves no false $\\Sigma_1^0$ sentences. If $T \\vdash \\neg G_T$, it means $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. The sentence $\\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$ is a $\\Sigma_1^0$ sentence. If $T$ is consistent, then $T \\not\\vdash G_T$, which means there is no proof of $G_T$ in $T$. Therefore, the sentence $\\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$ is false in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$. If $T$ proves this false $\\Sigma_1^0$ sentence, $T$ cannot be $1$-consistent. Conversely, it is known that one can construct a consistent theory $T$ which is not $1$-consistent and for which $T \\vdash \\neg G_T$. Thus, the first part of the statement is correct.\n2.  **Sufficiency of consistency for $R_T$**: As established in the analysis of option A, this is the main result of Rosser's theorem. Mere consistency is indeed sufficient to establish that both $R_T$ and $\\neg R_T$ are independent of $T$.\n\nThis statement provides an accurate and precise comparison.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. For any sound theory $T$ extending $Q$, both $G_T$ and $R_T$ are true in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$, but $R_T$ can fail to be $\\Pi_1^0$; hence, the truth of $R_T$ in $\\mathbb{N}$ cannot be settled by $1$-consistency alone.**\n\nA sound theory $T$ proves only sentences true in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$. Soundness implies $\\omega$-consistency, which in turn implies $1$-consistency and consistency.\n1.  **Truth of $G_T$ and $R_T$**: Since a sound theory $T$ is consistent, $T \\not\\vdash G_T$ and $T \\not\\vdash R_T$. The statement $G_T$ asserts the unprovability of $G_T$ in $T$, and $R_T$ asserts its own \"Rosser-unprovability\". As argued in the analysis of option A, since $T \\not\\vdash R_T$, the condition $\\operatorname{RPrf}_T(n, \\ulcorner R_T \\urcorner)$ is false for every natural number $n$, so $\\forall x \\neg \\operatorname{RPrf}_T(x, \\ulcorner R_T \\urcorner)$ is true. Thus both $G_T$ and $R_T$ are true in $\\mathbb{N}$. The first part is correct.\n2.  **Complexity of $R_T$**: As shown in the analysis of option B, the claim that \"$R_T$ can fail to be $\\Pi_1^0$\" is false. $R_T$ is constructed to be a $\\Pi_1^0$ sentence.\n3.  **Conclusion**: The word \"hence\" indicates that the conclusion follows from the premise about complexity. Since the premise is false, the argument is unsound.\n\nThe overall statement is flawed due to the incorrect assertion about the arithmetical complexity of $R_T$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2973586"}]}
