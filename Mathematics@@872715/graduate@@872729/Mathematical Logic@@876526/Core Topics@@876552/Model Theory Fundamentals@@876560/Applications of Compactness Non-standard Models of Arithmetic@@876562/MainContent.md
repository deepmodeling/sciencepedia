## Introduction
The natural numbers, governed by the principles of Peano Arithmetic (PA), seem to form a unique and unassailable structure. Yet, a profound consequence of [first-order logic](@entry_id:154340) is the existence of "[non-standard models](@entry_id:151939)" of arithmetic—structures that satisfy every axiom of PA but contain "infinite" numbers, making them fundamentally different from the familiar set $\mathbb{N}$. This article explores this fascinating paradox, revealing it not as a flaw, but as a deep insight into the nature of logical expression and mathematical truth. It addresses the knowledge gap between the intuitive certainty of arithmetic and the formal limitations of its first-order axiomatization, demonstrating how these limitations give rise to an unexpectedly rich universe of arithmetical structures.

This exploration begins by covering the foundational principles and mechanisms that give rise to [non-standard models](@entry_id:151939), focusing on the Compactness Theorem and construction techniques. The article then examines the applications and broader implications of these models, from the expressive limits of logic to connections with advanced number theory. Finally, a series of hands-on problems are provided in the appendices to solidify your understanding of the construction and properties of these remarkable mathematical objects.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the foundational principles and constructive mechanisms that govern the existence and structure of [non-standard models of arithmetic](@entry_id:151387). We will begin by examining the Compactness Theorem of first-order logic, the central tool for these investigations, exploring its origins in the finitary nature of logical proofs. Subsequently, we will deploy this theorem to construct [non-standard models](@entry_id:151939), first through a classic argument and then via the more algebraic method of ultrapowers. We will then probe the intricate architecture of these models, distinguishing between different types of extensions and exploring the limits of definability within them. Finally, we will place our findings in a broader context by contrasting the properties of first-order logic with those of second-order logic, thereby illuminating why the phenomena we study are unique to the first-order setting.

### The Compactness Theorem: The Central Tool

The Compactness Theorem is arguably the most powerful tool in the model theorist's arsenal. Its statement is deceptively simple, yet its consequences are profound, chief among them the guaranteed existence of models with properties not immediately apparent from their axioms. To understand this principle, we must first look to the nature of formal proofs in [first-order logic](@entry_id:154340).

#### The Finite Nature of First-Order Proofs

Standard deductive systems for [first-order logic](@entry_id:154340), such as [natural deduction](@entry_id:151259) or Hilbert-style systems, are fundamentally **finitary**. This means that a proof is a finite sequence of formulas, where each formula is either an axiom, a premise from a given set of sentences $\Gamma$, or derived from a finite number of preceding formulas by an inference rule. Because any proof is a finite object, a proof of a sentence $\sigma$ from a set of premises $\Gamma$ can only ever utilize a finite subset of $\Gamma$.

This observation gives rise to a crucial property of the first-order consequence relation, denoted by $\vdash$. This relation is said to have **finite character**: if $\Gamma \vdash \sigma$, then there must exist a finite subset $\Delta \subseteq \Gamma$ such that $\Delta \vdash \sigma$. This property is a direct consequence of the finite structure of proofs.

The finitary nature of [first-order logic](@entry_id:154340) is not a universal feature of all logical systems. One could, for example, augment a system with an infinitary rule like the **ω-rule**, which allows one to infer $\forall x \, \varphi(x)$ from the infinite set of premises $\{\varphi(\overline{0}), \varphi(\overline{1}), \varphi(\overline{2}), \dots \}$. In such a system, the consequence relation no longer has finite character. For instance, the set $\Gamma = \{\varphi(\overline{n}) : n \in \mathbb{N}\} \cup \{\neg \forall x \, \varphi(x)\}$ is inconsistent under the ω-rule, as one can derive $\forall x \, \varphi(x)$ from its infinite subset and immediately find a contradiction. However, every finite subset of $\Gamma$ is consistent, as the ω-rule cannot be invoked. This failure of finite character is the primary reason why compactness does not hold for such infinitary logics [@problem_id:2984986].

#### From Finitude to Compactness

The finite character of the first-order consequence relation is the key ingredient in the syntactic proof of the Compactness Theorem. The proof often proceeds via **Lindenbaum's Lemma**, which states that any consistent set of sentences can be extended to a maximally consistent set. The proof of this lemma relies on Zorn's Lemma. To apply Zorn's Lemma, one must show that the union of any chain of consistent theories is itself consistent. It is precisely the finite character of $\vdash$ that guarantees this: if the union of a chain were inconsistent, there would be a finite proof of a contradiction from a finite subset of the union. This finite subset, by the nature of chains, must be contained within some single theory in the chain, contradicting the assumption that all theories in the chain were consistent. This argument breaks down in systems lacking finite character, such as the one with the ω-rule described above [@problem_id:2984986].

Once a consistent theory $\Gamma$ is extended to a maximal consistent and Henkin-[complete theory](@entry_id:155100) $\Gamma^*$, a model can be constructed from the terms of the language. This route, which establishes the **Completeness Theorem** (a theory is consistent if and only if it is satisfiable), leads directly to the **Compactness Theorem**.

**The Compactness Theorem:** A set of first-order sentences $\Gamma$ has a model if and only if every finite subset of $\Gamma$ has a model.

One direction is trivial: if $\Gamma$ has a model $\mathcal{M}$, then $\mathcal{M}$ is also a model for every subset of $\Gamma$. The profound direction states that if every finite subset $\Gamma_0 \subseteq \Gamma$ is satisfiable (has a model), then the entire set $\Gamma$ is satisfiable. This can be proven by assuming, for contradiction, that $\Gamma$ is unsatisfiable. By the Completeness Theorem, $\Gamma$ must be inconsistent. This means $\Gamma \vdash \bot$ (where $\bot$ is a contradiction). By the finite character of the consequence relation, there must be a finite subset $\Gamma_0 \subseteq \Gamma$ such that $\Gamma_0 \vdash \bot$. This implies $\Gamma_0$ is inconsistent and, by Completeness again, unsatisfiable. This contradicts our initial assumption that every finite subset of $\Gamma$ was satisfiable [@problem_id:2968357].

### Constructing Non-Standard Models of Arithmetic

The primary application we will explore is the use of the Compactness Theorem to prove the existence of mathematical structures that are elementarily equivalent to the standard model of [natural numbers](@entry_id:636016), $\mathbb{N}$, yet are not isomorphic to it. These are the **[non-standard models of arithmetic](@entry_id:151387)**.

#### Formal Theories of Arithmetic: PA and Q

The standard first-order theory for arithmetic is **Peano Arithmetic (PA)**. It is formulated in the language $\mathcal{L}_{\text{PA}} = \{0, S, +, \cdot, \}$, where $S$ is the successor function. PA consists of a [finite set](@entry_id:152247) of base axioms governing the behavior of these symbols, plus the **first-order induction schema**. This schema is not a single axiom but an infinite collection of axioms, one for each formula $\varphi(x, \vec{y})$ in the language:
$$ \big( \varphi(0, \vec{y}) \land \forall x (\varphi(x, \vec{y}) \to \varphi(Sx, \vec{y})) \big) \to \forall x \, \varphi(x, \vec{y}) $$
Because there are infinitely many formulas in $\mathcal{L}_{\text{PA}}$, PA is an infinitely axiomatized theory. However, since the structure of an induction axiom is algorithmically recognizable, PA is a **recursively axiomatizable** theory. This is in contrast to weaker, finitely axiomatized theories like **Robinson Arithmetic (Q)**, which includes only the basic [recursive definitions](@entry_id:266613) for addition and multiplication and lacks any form of induction [@problem_id:2968359]. It is the power of the full induction schema that allows PA to prove many fundamental theorems of number theory.

#### The Classic Compactness Argument

Despite the power of PA, its first-order nature makes it susceptible to the consequences of the Compactness Theorem. This allows us to prove the existence of [non-standard models](@entry_id:151939). The construction is elegant in its simplicity. We expand the language $\mathcal{L}_{\text{PA}}$ with a new constant symbol, $c$. Consider the following infinite set of sentences:
$$ T = \text{PA} \cup \{ \overline{n}  c : n \in \mathbb{N} \} $$
Here, $\overline{n}$ represents the numeral for the natural number $n$, which is the term $S(S(\dots S(0)\dots))$ with $n$ applications of the successor function $S$. The new axioms state that the element denoted by $c$ is larger than every standard natural number.

To apply the Compactness Theorem, we must verify that every finite subset of $T$ has a model. Let $T_{fin}$ be an arbitrary finite subset of $T$. It will contain the axioms of PA (or, more precisely, a finite number of them, though since all models of PA satisfy all its axioms, we can just say it's PA) and a finite number of new axioms of the form $\{\overline{n_1}  c, \overline{n_2}  c, \dots, \overline{n_k}  c\}$. Let $N = \max\{n_1, n_2, \dots, n_k\}$. We can easily find a model for $T_{fin}$: the standard model $\mathbb{N}$ itself. We interpret the symbols of PA as usual and interpret the new constant $c$ as the natural number $N+1$. In this interpretation, all axioms of PA are true, and all sentences $\overline{n_i}  c$ become true statements in $\mathbb{N}$ (i.e., $n_i  N+1$).

Since every finite subset of $T$ is satisfiable, the Compactness Theorem guarantees that the entire set $T$ has a model, which we will call $\mathcal{M}^*$. This model $\mathcal{M}^*$ satisfies all the axioms of PA, so it is a model of Peano Arithmetic. However, it also satisfies the infinite set of axioms $\{\overline{n}  c : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. This means the element interpreting $c$ in $\mathcal{M}^*$ is an object that is larger than the interpretation of $\overline{0}$, $\overline{1}$, $\overline{2}$, and so on. This element is a **non-standard integer**. The existence of even one such element means that $\mathcal{M}^*$ cannot be isomorphic to $\mathbb{N}$. Thus, PA must have [non-standard models](@entry_id:151939) [@problem_id:2968357] [@problem_id:2968359].

#### The Ultrapower Construction: An Algebraic Alternative

A more explicit, algebraic method for constructing [non-standard models](@entry_id:151939) is the **[ultrapower construction](@entry_id:148329)**. This method depends on the existence of a **[non-principal ultrafilter](@entry_id:153994)** on the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$, the existence of which is guaranteed by the Axiom of Choice.

A filter on $\mathbb{N}$ is a collection of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ that contains $\mathbb{N}$, is closed under finite intersections and supersets, and does not contain the [empty set](@entry_id:261946). An ultrafilter is a maximal filter. An ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $\mathbb{N}$ is **non-principal** if it contains no finite sets. A key property of such [ultrafilters](@entry_id:155017) is that they must contain all **cofinite** sets (sets whose complement in $\mathbb{N}$ is finite) [@problem_id:2968353] [@problem_id:2968355]. If we were to use a **principal [ultrafilter](@entry_id:154593)**—one generated by a single element $i_0 \in \mathbb{N}$, i.e., $\mathcal{U}_{i_0} = \{ A \subseteq \mathbb{N} : i_0 \in A \}$—the resulting [ultrapower](@entry_id:635017) would be isomorphic to the original structure, $\mathbb{N}$, and thus would not be non-standard [@problem_id:2968353].

Given a [non-principal ultrafilter](@entry_id:153994) $\mathcal{U}$ on $\mathbb{N}$, we construct the [ultrapower](@entry_id:635017) $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}/\mathcal{U}$. The domain of this new structure is the set of all functions $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, factored by an equivalence relation: $f \sim g$ if and only if the set of points where they agree, $\{n \in \mathbb{N} : f(n) = g(n)\}$, is a member of the [ultrafilter](@entry_id:154593) $\mathcal{U}$. We denote the equivalence class of a function $f$ by $[f]$. The operations and relations of arithmetic are defined pointwise. For example, $[f] + [g]$ is defined as the class of the function $h(n) = f(n) + g(n)$, and $[f]  [g]$ holds if and only if $\{n \in \mathbb{N} : f(n)  g(n)\} \in \mathcal{U}$.

The behavior of this structure is governed by **Łoś's Theorem**, which is the fundamental theorem of [ultraproducts](@entry_id:148557). It states that a first-order formula $\varphi([f_1], \dots, [f_m])$ is true in the [ultrapower](@entry_id:635017) if and only if the set of indices $n$ for which the formula $\varphi(f_1(n), \dots, f_m(n))$ is true in the original structure $\mathbb{N}$ is in the [ultrafilter](@entry_id:154593) $\mathcal{U}$ [@problem_id:2968355].
$$ \mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}/\mathcal{U} \models \varphi([f_1], \dots, [f_m]) \iff \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : \mathbb{N} \models \varphi(f_1(n), \dots, f_m(n)) \} \in \mathcal{U} $$
A direct consequence of Łoś's Theorem is that the [ultrapower](@entry_id:635017) $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}/\mathcal{U}$ is **elementarily equivalent** to $\mathbb{N}$; it satisfies the exact same first-order sentences. The diagonal embedding map $j: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}/\mathcal{U}$, which sends each standard integer $k$ to the class of the [constant function](@entry_id:152060) $c_k(n) = k$, is an **[elementary embedding](@entry_id:155980)** [@problem_id:2968355].

To see that this structure is non-standard, consider the [identity function](@entry_id:152136) $\text{id}(n) = n$. Its [equivalence class](@entry_id:140585), $[\text{id}]$, is an element of the [ultrapower](@entry_id:635017). Let us compare it to any standard integer $k$, represented by the class $[c_k]$. The relation $[\text{id}] > [c_k]$ holds if and only if the set $\{n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{id}(n) > c_k(n)\} = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : n > k\}$ is in $\mathcal{U}$. This set is cofinite for any given $k$. Since $\mathcal{U}$ is a [non-principal ultrafilter](@entry_id:153994), it contains all cofinite sets. Therefore, $[\text{id}]$ is an element of the [ultrapower](@entry_id:635017) that is greater than every standard integer. This makes $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}/\mathcal{U}$ a [non-standard model of arithmetic](@entry_id:148348) [@problem_id:2968353] [@problem_id:2968355]. The Keisler-Shelah Theorem provides a profound connection between these two construction methods, stating that two structures are elementarily equivalent if and only if they have isomorphic ultrapowers, thereby unifying the abstract [existence proof](@entry_id:267253) from compactness with the algebraic [ultrapower construction](@entry_id:148329) [@problem_id:2968353].

### The Structural Richness of Non-Standard Models

The existence of [non-standard models](@entry_id:151939) opens up a new field of inquiry: what is their structure? These models are not simply copies of $\mathbb{N}$ with "infinity points" tacked on at the end. Their order structure can be remarkably complex.

#### Elementary vs. End Extensions

To discuss the structure of [non-standard models](@entry_id:151939), we need two key definitions [@problem_id:2968358]:

1.  An **[elementary extension](@entry_id:153360)** of a model $M$ is a model $N$ such that $M$ is a substructure of $N$ ($M \subseteq N$) and for every formula $\varphi(\bar{x})$ and every tuple of parameters $\bar{a}$ from $M$, we have $M \models \varphi(\bar{a})$ if and only if $N \models \varphi(\bar{a})$. This is denoted $M \prec N$. All truths about elements of $M$, expressible in first-order logic, remain the same in the larger model $N$.

2.  An **end extension** of an ordered model $M$ is a model $N$ such that $M \subseteq N$ and there are no "new" elements of $N$ located between "old" elements of $M$. Formally, for any $a \in M$ and $b \in N$, if $N \models b  a$, then it must be that $b \in M$. This means the elements of $M$ form an initial segment of the elements of $N$.

The [ultrapower construction](@entry_id:148329) of $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}/\mathcal{U}$ yields an [elementary extension](@entry_id:153360) of $\mathbb{N}$. The classic compactness argument that introduces a constant $c$ with axioms $c > \overline{n}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ also produces an end extension. Any model $N$ of $Th(\mathbb{N})$ generated this way is an end extension of its standard part because any element smaller than a standard number $\overline{n}$ must be one of the standard numbers $\{\overline{0}, \dots, \overline{n-1}\}$, a fact provable from the axioms [@problem_id:2968358].

However, it is a common misconception that these two properties are linked. They are, in fact, independent. We can use the Compactness Theorem to construct elementary extensions that are not end extensions. For example, let $M$ be a non-standard model of PA and let $a \in M$ be a non-standard element. We can introduce a new constant $c$ and consider the theory consisting of the full theory of $M$ along with axioms stating $\{c  a\} \cup \{c \neq m \text{ for all } m \in M\}$. Since the set of elements smaller than the non-standard element $a$ is infinite in $M$, any finite subset of these axioms is satisfiable in $M$. By compactness, there exists a model $N$ with a new element $c^N$ that is smaller than $a$ (an "old" element) but is not one of the original elements of $M$. This model $N$ is an [elementary extension](@entry_id:153360) of $M$ but is not an end extension [@problem_id:2968358]. This demonstrates the existence of models with a dense, complex structure of non-standard numbers.

#### Satisfaction Classes and Tarski's Theorem

The complexity of [non-standard models](@entry_id:151939) can be further appreciated by considering their capacity to model their own semantics. A **full satisfaction class** for a model $M \models \text{PA}$ is an interpretation of a new binary predicate, $\mathsf{Sat}(u, s)$, in an expanded model $(M, \mathsf{Sat})$ that behaves like a truth predicate for formulas of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{PA}}$. Here, $u$ is the Gödel code of a formula and $s$ codes a variable assignment. The predicate must satisfy the Tarskian compositional axioms for all formulas (standard and non-standard) coded within $M$. For example:
-   $\mathsf{Sat}(\ulcorner \varphi \land \psi \urcorner, s) \leftrightarrow \mathsf{Sat}(\ulcorner \varphi \urcorner, s) \land \mathsf{Sat}(\ulcorner \psi \urcorner, s)$
-   $\mathsf{Sat}(\ulcorner \exists v_i \varphi \urcorner, s) \leftrightarrow \exists a \in M \; \mathsf{Sat}(\ulcorner \varphi \urcorner, s[v_i \mapsto a])$

A crucial result, a relativized version of **Tarski's Undefinability of Truth Theorem**, shows that such a satisfaction predicate $\mathsf{Sat}$ cannot be definable by a formula within the original language $\mathcal{L}_{\text{PA}}$. If it were, one could use the Diagonal Lemma to construct a sentence that asserts its own falsehood, leading to a contradiction [@problem_id:2968354].

While a model of PA cannot define its own truth predicate, the Compactness Theorem can be used to show that a model can be extended to one that *possesses* such a (non-definable) predicate. The theory consisting of the complete diagram of a model $M$ plus the infinite set of Tarskian axioms for $\mathsf{Sat}$ is finitely satisfiable. Thus, by compactness, there exists an expansion of $M$ that contains a full satisfaction class. The existence of such models that can "talk about truth" internally, even if non-definably, is a testament to the rich possibilities within the universe of [non-standard arithmetic](@entry_id:149151).

### Context and Limitations: The Case of Second-Order Logic

To fully appreciate the significance of compactness in [first-order logic](@entry_id:154340), it is instructive to examine a logic where it fails: **second-order logic (SOL)** with [standard semantics](@entry_id:634682). In SOL, one can quantify not only over individual elements but also over sets of elements, relations, and functions.

#### Categoricity of Second-Order Arithmetic (PA₂)

This added [expressive power](@entry_id:149863) allows for a much stronger axiomatization of arithmetic. The second-order induction axiom is a single sentence that quantifies over all subsets of the domain:
$$ \forall X \big( (0 \in X \land \forall y (y \in X \to Sy \in X)) \to \forall z (z \in X) \big) $$
This single axiom is so powerful that the resulting theory, **second-order Peano Arithmetic (PA₂)**, is **categorical**. This means that any two models of PA₂ are isomorphic. Since the standard model $\mathbb{N}$ is a model of PA₂, it follows that *all* models of PA₂ are isomorphic to $\mathbb{N}$. Consequently, there are no [non-standard models](@entry_id:151939) of [second-order arithmetic](@entry_id:151825) [@problem_id:2968356].

#### The Failure of Compactness in SOL

The [categoricity](@entry_id:151177) of PA₂ provides a [direct proof](@entry_id:141172) that the Compactness Theorem must fail for SOL. If compactness were to hold for SOL, we could take the theory PA₂ (which has an infinite model, $\mathbb{N}$) and, just as in the first-order case, add an infinite number of new constants and axioms stating they are all distinct. Every finite subset of this expanded theory would be satisfiable in $\mathbb{N}$. If compactness held, the entire theory would have a model, which would necessarily be uncountable. But this would contradict the [categoricity](@entry_id:151177) of PA₂, which dictates that all models must be countable and isomorphic to $\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, compactness does not hold for SOL with [standard semantics](@entry_id:634682) [@problem_id:2968356].

The very property of SOL that allows it to uniquely characterize the [natural numbers](@entry_id:636016) (its [expressive power](@entry_id:149863)) is what causes it to lose a key property of FOL (compactness). This trade-off is fundamental. The existence of [non-standard models of arithmetic](@entry_id:151387) is not a flaw of [first-order logic](@entry_id:154340), but rather a direct and profound consequence of its most essential and useful metalogical properties: the finitude of proof and the resulting compactness of the logic [@problem_id:2968356].
