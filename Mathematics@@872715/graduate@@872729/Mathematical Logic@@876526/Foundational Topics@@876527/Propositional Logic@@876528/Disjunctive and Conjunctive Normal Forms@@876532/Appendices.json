It is a well-posed problem in classical propositional logic, free of scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, or contradiction. All necessary definitions and constraints are provided to proceed with a rigorous derivation and proof.\n\nThe core of the problem is to derive and validate minimal normal forms for the exclusive-or operator, $p \\oplus q$, based on its semantic definition.\n\n**1. Derivation and Minimality of the Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)**\n\nThe semantic definition states that $p \\oplus q$ is true if and only if exactly one of the propositional variables $p$ or $q$ is true. This can be expressed as a disjunction of the two cases where this condition holds:\nCase 1: $p$ is true and $q$ is false. This corresponds to the conjunction $p \\land \\neg q$.\nCase 2: $p$ is false and $q$ is true. This corresponds to the conjunction $\\neg p \\land q$.\n\nCombining these two mutually exclusive cases with a disjunction ($\\lor$) gives the logical expression equivalent to $p \\oplus q$:\n$$ (p \\land \\neg q) \\lor (\\neg p \\land q) $$\nThis formula is in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), as it is a disjunction of conjunctive terms. Let the terms be $T_1 = p \\land \\neg q$ and $T_2 = \\neg p \\land q$.\n\nTo prove that this is a minimal DNF, we must show that it is an irredundant disjunction of all the prime implicants of $p \\oplus q$.\n\nAn implicant of a formula $F$ is a term $T$ such that $T \\models F$. A prime implicant is an implicant from which no literal can be removed without it ceasing to be an implicant.\n\nLet's analyze the term $T_1 = p \\land \\neg q$.\nBy construction, $(p \\land \\neg q) \\models (p \\oplus q)$, so $T_1$ is an implicant.\nTo check if it is prime, we test removing each literal:\n- Removing $p$ leaves $\\neg q$. The statement $\\neg q \\models (p \\oplus q)$ is false. A counterexample is when $p$ is false and $q$ is false. In this case, $\\neg q$ is true, but $p \\oplus q$ is false.\n- Removing $\\neg q$ leaves $p$. The statement $p \\models (p \\oplus q)$ is false. A counterexample is when $p$ is true and $q$ is true. In this case, $p$ is true, but $p \\oplus q$ is false.\nSince no literal can be removed, $T_1 = p \\land \\neg q$ is a prime implicant.\n\nBy symmetry, the same reasoning applies to the term $T_2 = \\neg p \\land q$. It is also a prime implicant.\n\nAre there any other prime implicants? We can analyze the truth table for $p \\oplus q$:\n| $p$ | $q$ | $p \\oplus q$ | Minterms |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | |\n| $0$ | $1$ | $1$ | $\\neg p \\land q$ |\n| $1$ | $0$ | $1$ | $p \\land \\neg q$ |\n| $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | |\nThe function $p \\oplus q$ is the disjunction of its minterms, which are precisely $T_1$ and $T_2$. In a Karnaugh map, these two '1's are isolated and cannot be combined into larger groups. This visually confirms that $\\neg p \\land q$ and $p \\land \\neg q$ are the only prime implicants.\n\nThe minimal DNF is formed by the disjunction of a set of prime implicants that is both complete (covers all true cases) and irredundant (no term can be removed). The set $\\{p \\land \\neg q, \\neg p \\land q\\}$ contains all prime implicants of the function. Removing either term would cause the expression to no longer be equivalent to $p \\oplus q$. For example, removing $\\neg p \\land q$ would make the expression false for $p=0, q=1$. Therefore, the DNF $(p \\land \\neg q) \\lor (\\neg p \\land q)$ is irredundant.\n\nThis DNF has $2$ terms. Since any equivalent DNF must be built from prime implicants, and we have shown there are exactly two, no equivalent DNF can have fewer than $2$ terms. Thus, this DNF is minimal in the number of terms. We denote this minimal number by $t$, so $t=2$.\nFurthermore, it contains a total of $4$ literals. Since the two prime implicants each require two literals, any DNF with $2$ terms must have at least $4$ literals. Therefore, this DNF also minimizes the total number of literal occurrences.\n\n**2. Derivation and Minimality of the Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)**\n\nA Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) can be derived by considering the negation of the formula, $\\neg(p \\oplus q)$. A formula is false if and only if its negation is true. $p \\oplus q$ is false if and only if $p$ and $q$ have the same truth value. This gives two cases:\nCase 1: $p$ is true and $q$ is true, corresponding to $p \\land q$.\nCase 2: $p$ is false and $q$ is false, corresponding to $\\neg p \\land \\neg q$.\nThus, the DNF for $\\neg(p \\oplus q)$ is $(p \\land q) \\lor (\\neg p \\land \\neg q)$.\n\nTo find the CNF for $p \\oplus q$, we negate the DNF of its negation and apply De Morgan's laws:\n$$ p \\oplus q \\equiv \\neg(\\neg(p \\oplus q)) \\equiv \\neg( (p \\land q) \\lor (\\neg p \\land \\neg q) ) $$\nApplying De Morgan's law $\\neg(A \\lor B) \\equiv \\neg A \\land \\neg B$:\n$$ \\equiv \\neg(p \\land q) \\land \\neg(\\neg p \\land \\neg q) $$\nApplying De Morgan's law $\\neg(A \\land B) \\equiv \\neg A \\lor \\neg B$ to both conjuncts:\n$$ \\equiv (\\neg p \\lor \\neg q) \\land (\\neg(\\neg p) \\lor \\neg(\\neg q)) $$\nApplying the law of double negation $\\neg(\\neg A) \\equiv A$:\n$$ \\equiv (\\neg p \\lor \\neg q) \\land (p \\lor q) $$\nThis expression is in CNF. It is the conjunction of two clauses: $C_1 = \\neg p \\lor \\neg q$ and $C_2 = p \\lor q$.\n\nTo prove minimality, we show that these are the only prime implicates of $p \\oplus q$. An implicate of a formula $F$ is a clause $C$ such that $F \\models C$. A prime implicate is one from which no literal can be removed without it ceasing to be an implicate.\n\nLet's analyze the clause $C_1 = \\neg p \\lor \\neg q$.\nThe statement $(p \\oplus q) \\models (\\neg p \\lor \\neg q)$ is true, because if $p \\oplus q$ is true, it is not the case that both $p$ and $q$ are true, which is exactly what $\\neg p \\lor \\neg q$ asserts.\nTo check if it is prime, we remove literals:\n- Removing $\\neg p$ leaves $\\neg q$. The statement $(p \\oplus q) \\models \\neg q$ is false. A counterexample is $p=0, q=1$. Here, $p \\oplus q$ is true, but $\\neg q$ is false.\n- Removing $\\neg q$ leaves $\\neg p$. The statement $(p \\oplus q) \\models \\neg p$ is false. A counterexample is $p=1, q=0$. Here, $p \\oplus q$ is true, but $\\neg p$ is false.\nThus, $C_1$ is a prime implicate.\n\nLet's analyze the clause $C_2 = p \\lor q$.\nThe statement $(p \\oplus q) \\models (p \\lor q)$ is true, because if $p \\oplus q$ is true, at least one of $p$ or $q$ must be true.\nTo check if it is prime, we remove literals:\n- Removing $p$ leaves $q$. The statement $(p \\oplus q) \\models q$ is false. A counterexample is $p=1, q=0$.\n- Removing $q$ leaves $p$. The statement $(p \\oplus q) \\models p$ is false. A counterexample is $p=0, q=1$.\nThus, $C_2$ is also a prime implicate.\n\nThe minimal CNF is the conjunction of all prime implicates. The two false entries in the truth table for $p \\oplus q$ occur at $p=0, q=0$ and $p=1, q=1$. These correspond to the maxterms $(p \\lor q)$ and $(\\neg p \\lor \\neg q)$, respectively. Analysis of a Karnaugh map for the '0's shows they are isolated, confirming these are the only two prime implicates.\nThe CNF $(\\neg p \\lor \\neg q) \\land (p \\lor q)$ is irredundant because removing either clause would make the expression true for an input where it should be false (e.g., removing $p \\lor q$ makes it true for $p=0, q=0$).\n\nThis CNF has $2$ clauses. Since there are exactly two prime implicates, no equivalent CNF can have fewer clauses. Thus, it is minimal in the number of clauses. We denote this minimal number by $c$, so $c=2$.\nIt contains $4$ literals. Since the two prime implicates have two literals each, no $2$-clause CNF can have fewer literals. The CNF is therefore minimal in both clause count and literal count.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nWe have determined the minimal number of clauses in a CNF for $p \\oplus q$ to be $c=2$, and the minimal number of terms in a DNF to be $t=2$.\nThe problem asks for the computation of the binomial coefficient $\\binom{c+t}{c}$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\binom{c+t}{c} = \\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} $$\nThe value of $\\binom{4}{2}$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 $$\nThe result is a single exact number, $6$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{6} $$", "id": "2971857"}, {"introduction": "While converting between normal forms is always possible, the naive application of distributive laws can lead to an exponential increase in formula size.

To obtain a DNF from the given CNF, we must distribute the $\\land$ operators over the $\\lor$ operators until the expression is a disjunction of terms, where each term is a conjunction of literals. A close examination of the distributive law reveals that each final conjunctive term is formed by selecting exactly one literal from each of the original $k$ disjunctive clauses.\n\nFor example, a term in the final DNF will have the general form:\n$$\n(a_{1,j_1} \\land a_{2,j_2} \\land \\cdots \\land a_{k,j_k})\n$$\nwhere $a_{1,j_1}$ is a literal chosen from the first clause, $a_{2,j_2}$ is a literal chosen from the second clause, and so on, up to $a_{k,j_k}$ from the $k$-th clause. The index $j_i$ for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ must satisfy $1 \\le j_i \\le n_i$.\n\nThe problem specifies that this is a \"naive syntactic process\" and that simplifications are forbidden. This means that every unique combination of choices (one literal from each clause) will result in a distinct conjunctive term in the final DNF. Therefore, the task reduces to a combinatorial counting problem: how many ways are there to form such conjunctive terms?\n\nThis is a direct application of the fundamental principle of counting (also known as the rule of product). We are performing a sequence of $k$ independent choices:\n1.  Choose one literal from the first clause, $(\\bigvee_{j=1}^{n_1} a_{1j})$. There are $n_1$ literals to choose from.\n2.  Choose one literal from the second clause, $(\\bigvee_{j=1}^{n_2} a_{2j})$. There are $n_2$ literals to choose from.\n3.  ...\n$k$. Choose one literal from the $k$-th clause, $(\\bigvee_{j=1}^{n_k} a_{kj})$. There are $n_k$ literals to choose from.\n\nSince the choice from each clause is independent of the choices from the other clauses, the total number of distinct combinations is the product of the number of options available at each step.\n\nLet's use the provided example to illustrate: $\\varphi = (p \\lor q \\lor r) \\land (s \\lor t \\lor u)$.\nHere, $k=2$, the first clause has size $n_1=3$ (literals $\\{p, q, r\\}$), and the second clause has size $n_2=3$ (literals $\\{s, t, u\\}$).\nTo form a conjunctive term in the DNF, we must pick one literal from $\\{p, q, r\\}$ and one from $\\{s, t, u\\}$.\nThe possible pairs of choices are:\n$(p, s), (p, t), (p, u)$\n$(q, s), (q, t), (q, u)$\n$(r, s), (r, t), (r, u)$\nThis gives a total of $3 \\times 3 = 9$ terms in the final DNF:\n$(p \\land s) \\lor (p \\land t) \\lor (p \\land u) \\lor (q \\land s) \\lor (q \\land t) \\lor (q \\land u) \\lor (r \\land s) \\lor (r \\land t) \\lor (r \\land u)$.\nThe number of terms is $N(3, 3) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nGeneralizing this result, the total number of conjunctive terms, $N(n_1, \\dots, n_k)$, is the product of the sizes of all the clauses:\n$$\nN(n_1, \\dots, n_k) = n_1 \\times n_2 \\times \\cdots \\times n_k\n$$\nThis can be expressed in closed form using product notation:\n$$\nN(n_1, \\dots, n_k) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} n_i\n$$\nThis formula precisely counts the number of leaves in the syntactic tree of the final DNF, as stipulated by the problem's constraints.

All terms are standard and the request is internally consistent.\n\nThe problem asks for several related tasks concerning the propositional formula $\\Phi$ given by $x \\leftrightarrow (y \\land z)$. We will address each in turn.\n\nFirst, we derive a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for $\\Phi$ by decomposing the biconditional into two implications, as stipulated. The biconditional $A \\leftrightarrow B$ is logically equivalent to the conjunction of two implications, $(A \\to B) \\land (B \\to A)$. Applying this to our formula $\\Phi$:\n$$\nx \\leftrightarrow (y \\land z) \\equiv (x \\to (y \\land z)) \\land ((y \\land z) \\to x)\n$$\nWe now convert each implication into its equivalent clausal form. The general form of an implication $A \\to B$ is equivalent to $\\neg A \\lor B$.\n\nLet's convert the first implication, $\\Phi_1: x \\to (y \\land z)$.\n$$\n\\Phi_1 \\equiv \\neg x \\lor (y \\land z)\n$$\nTo transform this into CNF, we apply the distributive law, $P \\lor (Q \\land R) \\equiv (P \\lor Q) \\land (P \\lor R)$.\n$$\n\\neg x \\lor (y \\land z) \\equiv (\\neg x \\lor y) \\land (\\neg x \\lor z)\n$$\nThis gives us two clauses: $C_1 = (\\neg x \\lor y)$ and $C_2 = (\\neg x \\lor z)$.\n\nNext, we convert the second implication, $\\Phi_2: (y \\land z) \\to x$.\n$$\n\\Phi_2 \\equiv \\neg (y \\land z) \\lor x\n$$\nUsing De Morgan's laws, $\\neg (P \\land Q) \\equiv \\neg P \\lor \\neg Q$, we get:\n$$\n\\neg (y \\land z) \\lor x \\equiv (\\neg y \\lor \\neg z) \\lor x\n$$\nBy the associativity of the disjunction operator $\\lor$, this is a single clause:\n$$\nC_3 = (x \\lor \\neg y \\lor \\neg z)\n$$\nThe final CNF encoding, which we shall call $\\Psi$, is the conjunction of all derived clauses:\n$$\n\\Psi \\equiv C_1 \\land C_2 \\land C_3 \\equiv (\\neg x \\lor y) \\land (\\neg x \\lor z) \\land (x \\lor \\neg y \\lor \\neg z)\n$$\n\nSecond, we must prove that this CNF, $\\Psi$, is equi-satisfiable with the original formula, $\\Phi$. Two formulas are equi-satisfiable if one is satisfiable if and only if the other is satisfiable. A stronger condition is logical equivalence, which states that two formulas have the same truth value under every possible truth assignment for their variables. Logical equivalence implies equi-satisfiability. In this case, since no new auxiliary variables were introduced, the derived formula $\\Psi$ is in fact logically equivalent to the original formula $\\Phi$. We can prove this by showing that the derivation from $\\Phi$ to $\\Psi$ used only equivalence-preserving rules of propositional logic:\n\\begin{align*}\nx \\leftrightarrow (y \\land z) \\equiv (x \\to (y \\land z)) \\land ((y \\land z) \\to x)  \\text{(Definition of } \\leftrightarrow \\text{)} \\\\\n\\equiv (\\neg x \\lor (y \\land z)) \\land (\\neg(y \\land z) \\lor x)  \\text{(Definition of } \\to \\text{)} \\\\\n\\equiv ((\\neg x \\lor y) \\land (\\neg x \\lor z)) \\land (\\neg y \\lor \\neg z \\lor x)  \\text{(Distributive and De Morgan's laws)} \\\\\n\\equiv (\\neg x \\lor y) \\land (\\neg x \\lor z) \\land (x \\lor \\neg y \\lor \\neg z)  \\text{(Associativity of } \\land \\text{)}\n\\end{align*}\nSince each step in the derivation preserves logical equivalence, the final CNF formula $\\Psi$ is logically equivalent to the initial formula $\\Phi$. This formally proves that they have the same set of satisfying assignments, and thus are equi-satisfiable.\n\nThird, we explain the role of equi-satisfiability in the Tseitin transformation. The Tseitin transformation is an algorithm to convert any propositional formula into an equi-satisfiable formula in CNF, with the size of the resulting formula being linear with respect to the size of the original. This is achieved by introducing a new, auxiliary propositional variable for each non-atomic subformula. For each subformula $\\sigma$, a new variable $a_{\\sigma}$ is introduced along with clauses representing the biconditional $a_{\\sigma} \\leftrightarrow \\sigma$. The final CNF is the conjunction of the clause for the top-level formula's auxiliary variable and all the clauses generated for the subformulas.\n\nThe resulting formula is not logically equivalent to the original because it contains new variables. However, it is equi-satisfiable: any satisfying assignment for the original formula can be extended to a satisfying assignment for the transformed formula, and any satisfying assignment for the transformed formula, when restricted to the original variables, satisfies the original formula. The purpose of this trade-off—sacrificing logical equivalence for equi-satisfiability—is to avoid the potential for an exponential increase in formula size that can occur when converting to CNF using only distributivity. For applications like automated theorem proving with SAT solvers, determining satisfiability is the core task, so preserving only equi-satisfiability is sufficient and computationally advantageous. The subproblem $x \\leftrightarrow (y \\land z)$ is a canonical example of the constraint clauses introduced for a subformula $(y \\land z)$ where $x$ plays the role of the auxiliary variable.\n\nFinally, we compute the exact number of distinct truth assignments to $\\{x, y, z\\}$ that satisfy the CNF. Since we have proven that the CNF is logically equivalent to the original formula $x \\leftrightarrow (y \\land z)$, we can count the satisfying assignments for the original, simpler formula. A formula $A \\leftrightarrow B$ is true precisely when $A$ and $B$ have the same truth value.\n\nCase 1: Both sides are true.\n$v(x) = \\text{True}$ and $v(y \\land z) = \\text{True}$.\nFor $v(y \\land z)$ to be true, both $v(y)$ and $v(z)$ must be true.

The assignments for $(y, z)$ that satisfy this are $(\\text{True}, \\text{False})$, $(\\text{False}, \\text{True})$, and $(\\text{False}, \\text{False})$. Since $v(x)$ must be false, this gives three satisfying assignments for $(x, y, z)$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $(\\text{False}, \\text{True}, \\text{False})$\n    \\item $(\\text{False}, \\text{False}, \\text{True})$\n    \\item $(\\text{False}, \\text{False}, \\text{False})$\n\\end{enumerate}\nIn total, the number of distinct satisfying assignments is the sum from both cases: $1 + 3 = 4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "2971889"}]}
