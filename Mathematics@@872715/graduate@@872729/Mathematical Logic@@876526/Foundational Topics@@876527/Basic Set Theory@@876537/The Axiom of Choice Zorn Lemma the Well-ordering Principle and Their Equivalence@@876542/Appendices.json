All definitions are standard and correct. The task is to find a flaw in a presented mathematical argument, which is a well-defined logical problem. The setting is purely abstract mathematics. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, self-contained, and poses a non-trivial conceptual challenge.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution and option analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the presented argument lies in applying Zorn's Lemma to the poset $P$ of finitely generated subgroups of a group $G$, ordered by inclusion $\\subseteq$. To apply Zorn's Lemma, one must verify its hypothesis: that every chain in $P$ has an upper bound *in* $P$.\n\nLet $C = \\{H_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ be a chain of finitely generated subgroups of $G$. The union $U = \\bigcup_{i \\in I} H_i$ is indeed a subgroup of $G$ and is a clear candidate for an upper bound since $H_i \\subseteq U$ for all $i \\in I$. For $U$ to be an upper bound *in* $P$, $U$ itself must be an element of $P$, which means $U$ must be finitely generated.\n\nThe faulty argument makes the claim: \"since each $H \\in C$ is finitely generated, the union of their finite generating sets generates $U$, so $U$ is finitely generated.\" Let $S_i$ be a finite generating set for $H_i$. Then $S = \\bigcup_{i \\in I} S_i$ is a generating set for $U$. However, the chain $C$ can be infinite (i.e., the index set $I$ can be infinite). The union of an infinite number of finite sets is not necessarily finite. If $S$ is an infinite set, then we have only shown that $U$ is generated by $S$, not that $U$ is finitely generated.\n\nThe claim that $U$ is always finitely generated is false. This can be demonstrated with a counterexample. Consider the additive group of rational numbers, $G = (\\mathbb{Q}, +)$. Any finitely generated subgroup of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is of the form $\\langle \\frac{p_1}{q_1}, \\ldots, \\frac{p_k}{q_k} \\rangle$, which is cyclic and can be written as $\\langle \\frac{a}{b} \\rangle$ for some $\\frac{a}{b} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. For instance, $\\langle \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3} \\rangle = \\langle \\frac{1}{6} \\rangle$. Now, consider the chain of subgroups $C = \\{H_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ where $H_n = \\langle \\frac{1}{n!} \\rangle$. Each $H_n$ is finitely (even singly) generated, so $H_n \\in P$. This is a chain because if $m \\le n$, then $n!$ is a multiple of $m!$, so $\\frac{1}{m!} \\in H_n$, which implies $H_m \\subseteq H_n$. The union is $U = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} H_n$. Any rational number $\\frac{p}{q}$ can be written as $\\frac{p(q-1)!}{q!}$, so it lies in $H_q$. Therefore, $U = \\mathbb{Q}$. However, the group $(\\mathbb{Q}, +)$ is not finitely generated. Thus, the union $U$ is not in the set $P$. This chain $C$ does not have an upper bound in $P$, so the hypothesis of Zorn's Lemma fails.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The claim that $U = \\bigcup_{H \\in C} H$ is finitely generated is false in general. For $G = \\bigoplus_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathbb{Z}$, let $H_n = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{Z}$. Then $\\{H_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is a chain in $P$, but $\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} H_n = G$, which is not finitely generated. Hence the chain-upper-bound hypothesis fails and Zorn’s lemma cannot be applied. A correct use of Zorn’s lemma in algebra is to consider the partially ordered set of linearly independent subsets of a vector space ordered by inclusion, where unions of chains remain linearly independent, yielding the existence of a basis.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the central flaw: the union of a chain of finitely generated subgroups is not necessarily finitely generated. It provides a perfect and standard counterexample. Let $G = \\bigoplus_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathbb{Z}$ be the direct sum of countably many copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$. $G$ is not finitely generated. Let $H_n = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{Z}$ be the subgroup consisting of sequences where only the first $n$ components can be non-zero. Each $H_n$ is generated by the first $n$ standard basis vectors, so it is finitely generated. The sequence of subgroups $\\{H_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ forms a chain under inclusion. Their union is $\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} H_n = G$, which is not finitely generated. This demonstrates that the hypothesis of Zorn's lemma is not met. The second part of the option correctly contrasts this with a valid use of Zorn's lemma (existence of a vector space basis), highlighting the key property required for the union to remain in the poset.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Since the Well-Ordering Principle is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice, well-order the elements of $G$ and select a minimal generating set for $G$. This guarantees a maximal finitely generated subgroup, so the original argument is essentially correct after appealing to well-ordering.**\n\nThis option is incorrect for several reasons. First, it does not identify the error in the given argument but rather dismisses it as \"essentially correct\" and proposes a different, flawed argument. The concept of a \"minimal generating set\" for a general group is not sufficient to solve the problem; for the group $G = \\bigoplus_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathbb{Z}$, a minimal generating set is infinite. The existence of such a set does not imply the existence of a maximal *finitely generated* subgroup. The reasoning is a non-sequitur.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The error is confusing a maximal element with a maximum. Because there is no largest finitely generated subgroup, Zorn’s lemma cannot be used. If one could show a largest finitely generated subgroup exists, then Zorn’s lemma would apply and the argument would be repaired.**\n\nThis option fundamentally misrepresents Zorn's Lemma. The lemma's purpose is to prove the existence of *maximal* elements, not necessarily a *maximum* (largest) element. The lack of a maximum element does not preclude the use of Zorn's lemma; in fact, this is a common scenario for its application. The statement \"If one could show a largest finitely generated subgroup exists, then Zorn’s lemma would apply\" is backwards; if a largest element is known to exist, it is trivially a maximal element, and Zorn's lemma is unnecessary to prove its existence. The original argument did not confuse maximal with maximum.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The union argument fails only if the chain has infinitely many members. Restrict attention to chains of strictly increasing finitely generated subgroups; the union of finitely many finite generating sets is finite, so every such chain has a finitely generated upper bound. This suffices for Zorn’s lemma.**\n\nThis option correctly observes that the argument only fails for infinite chains. However, its proposed solution is fatally flawed. The hypothesis of Zorn's lemma must hold for *all* chains in the poset, not just finite ones or some other restricted class. Verifying the condition for finite chains is always trivial (the largest element of the finite chain is an upper bound) and is never sufficient to apply the lemma in a non-trivial case. The power and purpose of Zorn's lemma is precisely to handle the consequences of properties holding over infinite chains.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Reverse the order on $P$ by defining $H_1 \\preceq H_2$ if $H_2 \\subseteq H_1$. Then every chain has an upper bound given by the intersection of the chain, and intersections of finitely generated subgroups are finitely generated. Therefore Zorn’s lemma applies and yields a minimal finitely generated subgroup.**\n\nThis option proposes a different argument which is also flawed. The claim that \"intersections of finitely generated subgroups are finitely generated\" is false. A well-known counterexample is in the free group on two generators, $F_2 = \\langle a, b \\rangle$. The intersection of the finitely generated subgroups $\\langle a, bab^{-1} \\rangle$ and $\\langle b, aba^{-1} \\rangle$ is the commutator subgroup $[F_2, F_2]$, which is a free group of infinite rank and thus not finitely generated. Since the premise of this alternative argument is false, its conclusion that Zorn's lemma applies is invalid.

The relation $\\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}}$ is defined on $P$ by $f \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}} g$ if and only if $\\operatorname{dom}(f) \\subseteq \\operatorname{dom}(g)$.\n    -   Is $(P, \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}})$ a partially ordered set?

This holds.\n        -   Transitivity: If $f \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}} g$ and $g \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}} h$, then $\\operatorname{dom}(f) \\subseteq \\operatorname{dom}(g)$ and $\\operatorname{dom}(g) \\subseteq \\operatorname{dom}(h)$. This implies $\\operatorname{dom}(f) \\subseteq \\operatorname{dom}(h)$, so $f \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}} h$. This holds.\n        -   Antisymmetry: If $f \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}} g$ and $g \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}} f$, then $\\operatorname{dom}(f) = \\operatorname{dom}(g)$. Does this imply $f=g$? No. Consider $\\mathcal{F} = \\{\\{1, 2\\}\\}$. Let $f_1$ be the function with domain $\\{\\{1, 2\\}\\}$ such that $f_1(\\{1, 2\\}) = 1$. Let $f_2$ be the function with domain $\\{\\{1, 2\\}\\}$ such that $f_2(\\{1, 2\\}) = 2$. Then $\\operatorname{dom}(f_1) = \\operatorname{dom}(f_2)$, so $f_1 \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}} f_2$ and $f_2 \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}} f_1$, but $f_1 \\neq f_2$. Thus, antisymmetry fails, and $(P, \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}})$ is not a partially ordered set. It is a preorder.\n    -   Furthermore, consider a chain $C$ in $(P, \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}})$. The candidate for an upper bound is $U = \\bigcup_{f \\in C} f$. For $U$ to be a function, if $(X, y_1) \\in U$ and $(X, y_2) \\in U$, we must have $y_1=y_2$. This means there exist $f_1, f_2 \\in C$ such that $f_1(X)=y_1$ and $f_2(X)=y_2$. Since $C$ is a chain, either $f_1 \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}} f_2$ or $f_2 \\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}} f_1$. But this only relates their domains; it does not require that $f_1(X) = f_2(X)$ on the intersection of their domains. The functions may be incompatible. For example, using $f_1$ and $f_2$ from above, a chain could be $\\{g_0, g_1, ...\\}$ where $g_0$ is an empty function, and for $i>0$, $g_i$ contains $f_1$ or $f_2$ on some sets. The union might not be a function.\n\n2.  The relation $\\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is defined on $P$ by $f \\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}} g$ if and only if $f \\subseteq g$ as sets of ordered pairs. This means $\\operatorname{dom}(f) \\subseteq \\operatorname{dom}(g)$ and for all $X \\in \\operatorname{dom}(f)$, $f(X)=g(X)$.\n    -   Is $(P, \\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ a partially ordered set?\n        -   Reflexivity: $f \\subseteq f$, so $f \\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}} f$. This holds.\n        -   Antisymmetry: If $f \\subseteq g$ and $g \\subseteq f$, then $f=g$ by the definition of set equality.

This is the correct structure to use.\n    -   Now, we check the condition for Zorn's Lemma. Let $C$ be a chain in $(P, \\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}})$. Let $U = \\bigcup_{f \\in C} f$.\n        -   Is $U$ a function? Suppose $(X, y_1) \\in U$ and $(X, y_2) \\in U$. There exist $f_1, f_2 \\in C$ such that $(X, y_1) \\in f_1$ and $(X, y_2) \\in f_2$. Since $C$ is a chain, either $f_1 \\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}} f_2$ or $f_2 \\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}} f_1$. Assume $f_1 \\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}} f_2$. This means $f_1 \\subseteq f_2$. Since $X \\in \\operatorname{dom}(f_1)$, it must be that $f_2(X) = f_1(X)$. So $y_2 = y_1$. Thus, $U$ is a function.\n        -   Is $U$ in $P$? The domain of $U$ is $\\bigcup_{f \\in C} \\operatorname{dom}(f) \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$. If $(X, y) \\in U$, then $(X,y) \\in f$ for some $f \\in C$. Since $f \\in P$, $y=f(X) \\in X$. Thus $U(X) \\in X$ for all $X \\in \\operatorname{dom}(U)$. So $U \\in P$.\n        -   Is $U$ an upper bound for $C$? For any $f \\in C$, we have $f \\subseteq \\bigcup_{g \\in C} g = U$. This means $f \\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}} U$. So $U$ is an upper bound for $C$.\n    -   All conditions of Zorn's Lemma are met for $(P, \\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}})$. Therefore, there exists a maximal element $m \\in P$.\n    -   To finish the proof of AC, one shows that this maximal element $m$ must have domain $\\mathcal{F}$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\operatorname{dom}(m) \\neq \\mathcal{F}$. Then there exists some $X_0 \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with $X_0 \\notin \\operatorname{dom}(m)$. Since $X_0$ is nonempty, we can choose an element $x_0 \\in X_0$. Define a new function $m' = m \\cup \\{(X_0, x_0)\\}$. Then $m'$ is a partial choice function, $m \\subseteq m'$, and $m \\neq m'$. This means $m \\prec_{\\mathrm{ext}} m'$, contradicting the maximality of $m$. Therefore, the assumption must be false, so $\\operatorname{dom}(m) = \\mathcal{F}$. This maximal element $m$ is the required choice function.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\nA. The underlying error is ordering by $\\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}}$; replacing it with $\\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ ensures that the union of any chain is a function and an upper bound. With this fix, Zorn’s Lemma yields a maximal partial choice function whose domain is all of $\\mathcal{F}$, establishing the Axiom of Choice.\n- This statement accurately summarizes the entire correct proof strategy derived above. It correctly identifies the flaw ($\\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}}$), the fix ($\\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}}$), why the fix works (union of a chain is an upper bound), and the final step of the proof (the maximal element is a total choice function).\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Even with $\\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, the union of an arbitrary chain of partial choice functions can fail to be a function unless the chain is well-ordered; therefore one must first well-order the chain via the Well-Ordering Principle.\n- This is incorrect. As shown in the derivation above, the union of *any* chain in $(P, \\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ is guaranteed to be a function. The compatibility is enforced by the definition of the $\\preceq_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ relation itself ($g$ must extend $f$). No additional condition like being well-ordered is necessary. Moreover, invoking the Well-Ordering Principle to prove the Axiom of Choice is logically circuitous, as they are equivalent axioms.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The relation $\\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}}$ is not a partial order (antisymmetry can fail), and it also permits chains containing incompatible functions, so the union need not be a function. Passing to equivalence classes modulo equality of domain does not fix the upper-bound problem because the upper bounds then live only at the level of domains and are not functions.\n- This statement correctly diagnoses two fatal flaws with the $\\preceq_{\\mathrmdom}$ approach. First, as demonstrated with the counterexample $f_1(\\{1,2\\})=1$ and $f_2(\\{1,2\\})=2$, $\\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}}$ is not antisymmetric and hence not a partial order. Second, it correctly notes that this relation allows incompatible functions in a chain, so their union is not a function. The final part is also a sharp insight: if one tries to repair the failure of antisymmetry by considering the set of domains, partially ordered by inclusion, one can find upper bounds for chains of domains (their unions), but this process loses the function information needed to construct the actual choice function. This is a correct and detailed analysis of the failure.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. One can avoid the incompatibility by keeping $\\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}}$ and restricting attention to chains that are directed (every pair has an upper bound). Zorn’s Lemma applies with this restriction, and the union of any directed family of partial choice functions is a function.\n- This statement is confused. A chain is by definition a set in which every pair of elements is comparable. This automatically implies that for any pair $\\{a, b\\}$ in a chain, the larger one is an upper bound for the pair, so any chain is a directed set. The phrase \"restricting attention to chains that are directed\" is therefore redundant. Even if the statement meant to consider general directed subsets (not necessarily chains), the fundamental problem remains. The relation $\\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}}$ does not enforce compatibility. The union of a directed set of functions under $\\preceq_{\\mathrm{dom}}$ can fail to be a function for the same reason a union of a chain can: the relation only constrains the domains, not the values.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2984613"}, {"introduction": "While Zorn's Lemma provides one path to the Axiom of Choice, the Well-Ordering Principle (WOP) offers another, employing a distinct and elegant technique.

Tagging ensures that for each $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ the set $A \\times \\{A\\}$ is disjoint from $B \\times \\{B\\}$ when $B \\neq A$, so the definition\n$$\nm_A \\;=\\; \\min_{\\prec}\\bigl( A \\times \\{A\\} \\bigr), \\qquad g(A) \\;=\\; \\pi_1(m_A),\n$$\nis unambiguous once a well-order $\\prec$ of $D$ is fixed, and $g \\colon \\mathcal{F} \\to \\bigcup \\mathcal{F}$ is well-defined.\n\nC. It is impossible to well-order the set $D$ without first assuming the Axiom of Choice (AC), since the sets $A \\times \\{A\\}$ cannot all be simultaneously handled by the Well-Ordering Principle when overlaps occur among the $A$’s.\n\nD. If $\\prec$ well-orders $D$, then the map $g \\colon \\mathcal{F} \\to \\bigcup \\mathcal{F}$ defined by $g(A) = \\pi_1\\!\\bigl(\\min_{\\prec}(A \\times \\{A\\})\\bigr)$ is a choice function for $\\mathcal{F}$, and this construction uses only the Well-Ordering Principle (WOP) as assumed, with no additional appeal to AC.\n\nE. If one seeks a system of distinct representatives (SDR), meaning a function $h \\colon \\mathcal{F} \\to \\bigcup \\mathcal{F}$ such that $h(A) \\in A$ for all $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $h$ is injective, then tagging together with WOP is sufficient: well-order $\\bigcup \\mathcal{F}$ and perform a transfinite greedy selection to avoid collisions.\n\nF. Assuming Zorn’s Lemma, let $P$ be the partially ordered set of partial choice functions $p \\colon \\operatorname{dom}(p) \\to \\bigcup \\mathcal{F}$ with $\\operatorname{dom}(p) \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$ and $p(A) \\in A$, ordered by extension. Every chain in $P$ has an upper bound given by the union of the chain, and Zorn’s Lemma yields a maximal $p$ that must be defined on all of $\\mathcal{F}$, hence a choice function; tagging is not required in this approach.\n\nG. The sethood of the disjointification $D$ follows from the Axiom of Replacement and the Axiom of Union: the definable mapping $A \\mapsto A \\times \\{A\\}$ sends the set $\\mathcal{F}$ to the set $\\{A \\times \\{A\\} \\mid A \\in \\mathcal{F}\\}$ by Replacement, and then $D = \\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{F}} (A \\times \\{A\\})$ is a set by Union.", "solution": "Begin by recalling the foundational definitions. A well-order on a set $X$ is a binary relation $$ that is a linear (total) order on $X$ such that every nonempty subset $Y \\subseteq X$ has a $$-least element. The Well-Ordering Principle (WOP) states that every set admits a well-order. The Axiom of Choice (AC) asserts that for every set $\\mathcal{F}$ of nonempty sets there exists a function $f \\colon \\mathcal{F} \\to \\bigcup \\mathcal{F}$ with $f(A) \\in A$ for all $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$; such $f$ is called a choice function. Zorn’s Lemma is the statement that if a partially ordered set has the property that every chain has an upper bound, then there exists at least one maximal element. We also use standard Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, notably the Axiom of Replacement and the Axiom of Union, to justify that certain collections are sets.\n\nThe core technique in the problem is disjointification by tagging: for a family $\\mathcal{F}$, replace each $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ by $A \\times \\{A\\}$, so members are distinguished by their tag, even if they were equal as elements of $\\bigcup \\mathcal{F}$. Under WOP, we may well-order the set $D = \\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{F}} (A \\times \\{A\\})$. Then for each $A$, since $A \\times \\{A\\}$ is nonempty and a subset of $D$, it has a least element with respect to the chosen well-order $\\prec$ of $D$. Projecting that least pair $(a, A)$ to $a$ defines a choice function.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. The claim is that selecting minima of the untagged sets $A$ under a well-ordering of $\\bigcup \\mathcal{F}$ may fail to produce a function because two different sets could choose the same element. However, a function $f \\colon \\mathcal{F} \\to \\bigcup \\mathcal{F}$ may legitimately take the same value at different inputs; functions need not be injective. If we well-order $\\bigcup \\mathcal{F}$ by $$ and define $f(A)$ as the $$-least element of $A$, then $f$ is well-defined and is a choice function, regardless of collisions across different $A$. Therefore the reason given — “violates the definition of a function” — is incorrect. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. Tagging ensures disjointness: for $A \\neq B$, we have $(A \\times \\{A\\}) \\cap (B \\times \\{B\\}) = \\varnothing$. Under a well-order $\\prec$ of $D$, each $A \\times \\{A\\}$ has a unique $\\prec$-least element $m_A$, and defining $g(A) = \\pi_1(m_A)$ yields an unambiguous value in $A$. This addresses any potential ambiguity at the level of the tagged union and then returns to the original elements via the first projection $\\pi_1$. The construction is legitimate and precise. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. This asserts that well-ordering $D$ is impossible without AC, especially due to overlaps among the $A$’s. In the present context we explicitly assume WOP (“every set admits a well-order”), and $D$ is a set (see Option G). Therefore $D$ can be well-ordered directly by WOP, independently of any separate invocation of AC. Moreover, overlaps among the original $A$’s do not obstruct well-ordering of $D$ because the disjoint copies $A \\times \\{A\\}$ are pairwise disjoint. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Suppose $\\prec$ is a well-order of $D$. For each $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$, the subset $A \\times \\{A\\} \\subseteq D$ is nonempty, hence has a $\\prec$-least element $m_A = (a_A, A)$. Defining $g(A) = \\pi_1(m_A) = a_A$ gives $g(A) \\in A$, so $g$ is a choice function. This construction relies only on the assumption WOP to obtain a well-order on the set $D$; once $\\prec$ is fixed, no further appeal to AC is needed to define $g$. In fact, the standard proof that WOP implies AC follows precisely this pattern (tagging is conceptually helpful but not strictly required to produce a choice function; see A and B). Verdict: Correct.\n\nE. A system of distinct representatives (SDR) for $\\mathcal{F}$ is an injective function $h \\colon \\mathcal{F} \\to \\bigcup \\mathcal{F}$ with $h(A) \\in A$ for all $A$. The existence of an SDR is strictly stronger than the existence of a choice function and is governed by structural conditions (for finite families, Hall’s Marriage Theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions; for general families, analogous conditions are required). Neither WOP nor AC alone guarantees an SDR. A greedy procedure along a well-order of $\\bigcup \\mathcal{F}$ can fail when the Hall-type constraints are not met; collisions cannot always be avoided. Thus the claim that tagging plus WOP suffices, via a transfinite greedy selection, is false. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nF. Define $P$ to be the set of partial choice functions on $\\mathcal{F}$:\n$$\nP \\;=\\; \\bigl\\{\\, p \\mid \\operatorname{dom}(p) \\subseteq \\mathcal{F},\\; p \\colon \\operatorname{dom}(p) \\to \\bigcup \\mathcal{F},\\; \\forall A \\in \\operatorname{dom}(p),\\; p(A) \\in A \\,\\bigr\\},\n$$\nordered by extension: $p \\leq q$ iff $\\operatorname{dom}(p) \\subseteq \\operatorname{dom}(q)$ and $q\\!\\upharpoonright_{\\operatorname{dom}(p)} = p$. If $C \\subseteq P$ is a chain, its union $u = \\bigcup C$ is a function whose domain is $\\bigcup_{p \\in C} \\operatorname{dom}(p)$, and for each $A$ in that domain we have $u(A) \\in A$ because the chain condition guarantees coherence of values. Thus every chain has an upper bound in $P$. By Zorn’s Lemma, $P$ contains a maximal element $p$. If $\\operatorname{dom}(p) \\neq \\mathcal{F}$, pick $A_0 \\in \\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\operatorname{dom}(p)$; since $A_0$ is nonempty, choose any $a_0 \\in A_0$ and extend $p$ by setting $p'(A_0) = a_0$, contradicting maximality. Therefore $\\operatorname{dom}(p) = \\mathcal{F}$ and $p$ is a choice function. This route requires no tagging. Note that choosing $a_0 \\in A_0$ uses only the fact that $A_0$ is nonempty; a single existential choice from a given nonempty set is justified in ZF. Verdict: Correct.\n\nG. To verify that $D$ is a set, observe that the mapping $A \\mapsto A \\times \\{A\\}$ is definable on the set $\\mathcal{F}$. By the Axiom of Replacement, the image $\\{A \\times \\{A\\} \\mid A \\in \\mathcal{F}\\}$ is a set of sets. Then, by the Axiom of Union, the union $D = \\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{F}} (A \\times \\{A\\})$ is a set. This justifies the applicability of WOP to $D$.
