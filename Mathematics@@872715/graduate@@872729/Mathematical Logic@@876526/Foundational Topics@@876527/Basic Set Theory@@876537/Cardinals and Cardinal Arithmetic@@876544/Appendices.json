We are also given that $|\\mathbb{Q}| = |\\mathbb{N}| = \\aleph_0$.\n\nWe will now compute the required cardinalities by constructing the necessary injections.\n\n### 1. Computation of $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}|$\n\nWe will use the Schröder–Bernstein theorem on the sets $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Injection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$:**\nWe must exhibit an injection $f_1: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$. Consider the function defined by $f_1(x) = (x, 0)$ for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. To verify that $f_1$ is injective, assume $f_1(x_1) = f_1(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. By definition, this means $(x_1, 0) = (x_2, 0)$, which implies $x_1 = x_2$. Thus, $f_1$ is an injection. The existence of this injection establishes that $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}|$.\n\n**Injection from $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$:**\nNext, we must exhibit an injection $g_1: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. As established, there exist bijections between $\\mathbb{R}$ and $2^{\\mathbb{N}}$. Let $\\phi: \\mathbb{R} \\to 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ be such a bijection. We can construct the desired injection $g_1$ as a composition of three functions:\n\n1.  A bijection $\\alpha: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\times 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ defined as $\\alpha((x, y)) = (\\phi(x), \\phi(y))$. Since $\\phi$ is a bijection, $\\alpha$ is also a bijection, and thus an injection.\n\n2.  An injection $\\beta: 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\times 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\to 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$. An element of $2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\times 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ is a pair of infinite binary sequences, $(s, t)$, where $s = (s_0, s_1, s_2, \\dots)$ and $t = (t_0, t_1, t_2, \\dots)$, with $s_i, t_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. We define the function $\\beta$ by interleaving these two sequences into a single sequence $u = \\beta((s, t))$. The sequence $u = (u_0, u_1, u_2, u_3, \\dots)$ is defined by setting $u_{2k} = s_k$ and $u_{2k+1} = t_k$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This function is injective: if $\\beta((s, t)) = \\beta((s', t'))$, the resulting interleaved sequences are identical. This implies that their even-indexed terms are the same (so $s=s'$) and their odd-indexed terms are the same (so $t=t'$). Thus, $(s, t)=(s', t')$. In fact, $\\beta$ is a bijection.\n\n3.  The bijection $\\phi^{-1}: 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. This exists because $\\phi$ is a bijection.\n\nThe composite function $g_1 = \\phi^{-1} \\circ \\beta \\circ \\alpha$ is a mapping from $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. Since it is a composition of injective functions (two of which are bijections), $g_1$ is an injection. The existence of this injection establishes that $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\nSince we have shown $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}|$ and $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\mathbb{R}|$, the Schröder–Bernstein theorem implies that $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}| = |\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n### 2. Computation of $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}|$\n\nWe proceed similarly, using the Schröder–Bernstein theorem on the sets $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Injection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$:**\nWe define an injection $f_2: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$. Let $q_0$ be any fixed rational number, for instance $q_0 = 0$. Consider the function $f_2(x) = (x, q_0)$. This function is injective because if $f_2(x_1) = f_2(x_2)$, then $(x_1, q_0) = (x_2, q_0)$, which implies $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}|$.\n\n**Injection from $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$:**\nNext, we construct an injection $g_2: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. We use the bijections $\\phi: \\mathbb{R} \\to 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ and $\\psi: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ (since $|\\mathbb{Q}| = |\\mathbb{N}|$). The injection $g_2$ is constructed from the following composition:\n\n1.  A bijection $\\gamma: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q} \\to 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ defined by $\\gamma((x, q)) = (\\phi(x), \\psi(q))$. This is a bijection because $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are bijections.\n\n2.  An injection $\\delta: 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$. Let an element of $2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ be a pair $(s, n)$, where $s = (s_0, s_1, s_2, \\dots)$ is an infinite binary sequence and $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We define a new sequence $v = \\delta((s, n))$ by prefixing $s$ with a representation of $n$. A simple injective map is to prepend $n$ copies of the digit $1$ followed by a $0$ to the sequence $s$. Formally, the sequence $v = (v_0, v_1, v_2, \\dots)$ is defined as:\n    $v_k = 1$ for $0 \\le k  n$\n    $v_n = 0$\n    $v_k = s_{k-(n+1)}$ for $k > n$\n    This function $\\delta$ is injective. If $\\delta((s, n)) = \\delta((s', n'))$, the resulting sequences are identical. The position of the first $0$ in the sequence $\\delta((s,n))$ is at index $n$. Thus, if the sequences are identical, their first $0$ must be at the same position, which means $n=n'$. With $n=n'$, the remaining parts of the sequences (after the prefix) must also be identical, which means $s=s'$. Therefore, $(s, n) = (s', n')$, and $\\delta$ is an injection.\n\n3.  The bijection $\\phi^{-1}: 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe composite function $g_2 = \\phi^{-1} \\circ \\delta \\circ \\gamma$ is an injection from $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. The existence of this injection establishes that $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}| \\le |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\nSince we have shown $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}|$ and $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}| \\le |\\mathbb{R}|$, the Schröder–Bernstein theorem implies that $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}| = |\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nIn summary, both cardinalities are equal to the cardinality of the continuum.\n$|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$\n$|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2^{\\aleph_0}  2^{\\aleph_0}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2969942"}, {"introduction": "Moving from products to powers, this exercise explores cardinal exponentiation, which corresponds to the size of function spaces.

The existence of such a bijection implies that the two sets have the same cardinality:\n    $$|\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{N}| = |\\mathbb{N}|$$\n    Therefore, we can conclude:\n    $$\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$$\n    Substituting this result back, we find the cardinality of $\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{Q}$:\n    $$|\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{Q}| = \\aleph_0$$\n\n2.  **Computation of $|\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{Q}}|$**\n    The cardinality of the set of all functions from a set $B$ to a set $A$, denoted $A^B$, is given by cardinal exponentiation: $|A^B| = |A|^{|B|}$.\n    Applying this definition, we have:\n    $$|\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{Q}}| = |\\mathbb{N}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|}$$\n    Substituting the known cardinalities, we need to compute the value of $\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0}$:\n    $$|\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{Q}}| = \\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0}$$\n    To evaluate this expression, we will use the given fact (iv), the Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder (CBS) theorem. The theorem states that if there exist injective functions $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to A$ between two sets $A$ and $B$, then there exists a bijection between them, which implies $|A| = |B|$.

We will show that $\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n    First, we establish the inequality $2^{\\aleph_0} \\le \\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    By definition, $2^{\\aleph_0} = |\\{0, 1\\}^{\\mathbb{N}}|$ and $\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0} = |\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{N}}|$.\n    Consider the set of all functions from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\{0, 1\\}$, which is $\\{0, 1\\}^{\\mathbb{N}}$. Since $\\{0, 1\\} \\subset \\mathbb{N}$, any function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ is also a function from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\mathbb{N}$. This means $\\{0, 1\\}^{\\mathbb{N}} \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{N}}$.

The Role of Cofinality**\n\nLet $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ be cardinals. We are given the definition $\\kappa^{\\lambda} = \\sup\\{\\kappa^{\\mu} : \\mu\\lambda\\}$. Let $C$ be a cofinal subset of the ordinal $\\lambda$. This means that for any ordinal $\\alpha  \\lambda$, there exists an ordinal $\\mu \\in C$ such that $\\alpha \\le \\mu$. We want to show that $\\sup\\{\\kappa^{\\mu}:\\mu\\in C\\}=\\sup\\{\\kappa^{\\mu}:\\mu\\lambda\\}$.\n\nLet $S_C = \\sup\\{\\kappa^{\\mu}:\\mu\\in C\\}$ and $S_\\lambda = \\sup\\{\\kappa^{\\mu}:\\mu\\lambda\\}$.\n\nFirst, we show that $S_C \\le S_\\lambda$. Since $C$ is a subset of $\\lambda$, the set of cardinals $\\{\\kappa^\\mu : \\mu \\in C\\}$ is a subset of the set of cardinals $\\{\\kappa^\\mu : \\mu  \\lambda\\}$. The least upper bound of a subset of an ordered class cannot be greater than the least upper bound of the class itself. Hence, $S_C \\le S_\\lambda$.\n\nNext, we show that $S_\\lambda \\le S_C$. Let $\\alpha$ be any cardinal such that $\\alpha  \\lambda$. Since $C$ is cofinal in $\\lambda$, there exists a cardinal $\\mu \\in C$ such that $\\alpha \\le \\mu$. Cardinal exponentiation is a non-decreasing function of its exponent; that is, if $\\alpha \\le \\mu$, then $\\kappa^\\alpha \\le \\kappa^\\mu$. This is because any function from a set of size $\\alpha$ to a set of size $\\kappa$ can be extended to a function from a set of size $\\mu$ to a set of size $\\kappa$ (e.g., by mapping all elements in the difference to a fixed element of $\\kappa$), which provides an injection from the set of functions ${}^\\alpha\\kappa$ into ${}^\\mu\\kappa$.\nSo, for any cardinal $\\alpha  \\lambda$, we have found a $\\mu \\in C$ such that $\\kappa^\\alpha \\le \\kappa^\\mu$.\nBy the definition of the supremum, $\\kappa^\\mu \\le S_C$.\nTherefore, for any cardinal $\\alpha  \\lambda$, we have $\\kappa^\\alpha \\le S_C$. This means that $S_C$ is an upper bound for the set of cardinals $\\{\\kappa^\\alpha : \\alpha  \\lambda\\}$. Since $S_\\lambda$ is the *least* upper bound of this set, we must have $S_\\lambda \\le S_C$.\n\nCombining the two inequalities, we conclude that $S_C = S_\\lambda$. That is, $\\sup\\{\\kappa^{\\mu}:\\mu\\in C\\}=\\sup\\{\\kappa^{\\mu}:\\mu\\lambda\\}$.\n\nThis result shows that the supremum is determined by the values of $\\kappa^\\mu$ on any cofinal subset of $\\lambda$. The cofinality, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda)$, is defined as the least order type of a cofinal subset of $\\lambda$. This means there always exists a cofinal subset $C \\subseteq \\lambda$ with order type $\\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda)$.\n\n- If $\\lambda$ is a regular cardinal, then $\\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda)=\\lambda$. This means the smallest order type for any cofinal subset is $\\lambda$ itself. We can simply choose $C=\\lambda$, which is cofinal in $\\lambda$ and has order type $\\lambda$. Any cofinal subset of a regular cardinal $\\lambda$ must have order type $\\lambda$.\n- If $\\lambda$ is a singular cardinal, then $\\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda)\\lambda$. By the very definition of cofinality, there exists a cofinal subset $C \\subseteq \\lambda$ with order type $\\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda)$. This allows us to reduce the calculation of the supremum over all $\\mu  \\lambda$ to a calculation over a smaller, more structured set of cardinals.\n\n**2.

Thus, $\\omega^n = \\omega$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\nThe set of cardinals whose supremum we seek is $\\{1, \\omega, \\omega, \\omega, \\dots\\}$.\nThe least upper bound of this set is $\\omega$.\nTherefore, $\\omega^{\\omega} = \\omega$.\n\n**(B) $\\kappa = \\omega$ and $\\lambda = \\omega_\\omega$ (Singular case)**\n\nWe need to compute $\\omega^{\\omega_\\omega}$.\nThe cardinal $\\lambda = \\omega_\\omega$ is the limit of the sequence of cardinals $\\langle \\omega_n : n  \\omega \\rangle$. It is a singular cardinal with cofinality $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_\\omega) = \\omega$.\nFollowing the reasoning in Part 1, we can compute the supremum over a cofinal subset of $\\omega_\\omega$ with order type $\\omega$. A natural choice for such a set is $C = \\{\\omega_n : n  \\omega\\}$. This set is cofinal in $\\omega_\\omega$ by definition of a limit ordinal which is a supremum of a sequence.\nUsing the result from Part 1:\n$$ \\omega^{\\omega_\\omega} = \\sup\\{\\omega^\\mu : \\mu  \\omega_\\omega\\} = \\sup\\{\\omega^{\\omega_n} : n  \\omega\\} $$\nNow, we must evaluate the terms $\\omega^{\\omega_n}$. For any infinite cardinal $\\mu$, we can show that $\\omega^\\mu = 2^\\mu$.\nFirst, since $2  \\omega$, we have $2^\\mu \\le \\omega^\\mu$.\nFor the other direction, since $\\mu$ is infinite, $\\omega = \\aleph_0 \\le \\mu$. Because cardinal exponentiation is non-decreasing in the base (for exponents $0$), we have $\\omega^\\mu \\le \\mu^\\mu$. A standard result of cardinal arithmetic states that $\\mu^\\mu = 2^\\mu$ for any infinite cardinal $\\mu$. Thus, $\\omega^\\mu \\le 2^\\mu$.\nCombining these inequalities, we have $\\omega^\\mu = 2^\\mu$.\nApplying this to our case, where $\\mu = \\omega_n$ (which is infinite for all $n\\omega$), we get $\\omega^{\\omega_n} = 2^{\\omega_n}$.\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $\\omega^{\\omega_\\omega}$:\n$$ \\omega^{\\omega_\\omega} = \\sup_{n\\omega} 2^{\\omega_n} $$\nThis expression represents the least cardinal that is greater than or equal to every cardinal in the sequence $\\langle 2^{\\omega_n} : n  \\omega \\rangle$. The values of $2^{\\omega_n}$ are not determined by the axioms of ZFC alone (their relation to the aleph scale depends on axioms like the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis). Therefore, this expression cannot be simplified further within ZFC to a single aleph number. This is the exact value expressed in standard cardinal arithmetic notation.\n\nThe two computed values are $\\omega$ and $\\sup_{n\\omega} 2^{\\omega_n}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\omega  \\sup_{n\\omega} 2^{\\omega_n} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2969901"}]}
