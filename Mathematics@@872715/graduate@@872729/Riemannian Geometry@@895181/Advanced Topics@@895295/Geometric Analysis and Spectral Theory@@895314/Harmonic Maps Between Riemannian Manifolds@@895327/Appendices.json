For a mapping problem with fixed Dirichlet boundary conditions, the energy functional $E(u)$ is strictly convex when the target manifold $(N,h)$ is a Hadamard manifold (a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature $K \\le 0$) or, more generally, a $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space. This strict convexity guarantees that if an energy minimizer exists, it is unique. The problem asks for counterexamples where this uniqueness fails, which must occur when the target space $N$ is not a Hadamard manifold or $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space.\n\nFor the special case of maps $u$ from the domain $M=[0,1]$ to a target $N$, weak harmonic maps are geodesics of $N$. An energy-minimizing map for fixed boundary data $u(0)=p$ and $u(1)=q$ corresponds to a constant-speed geodesic that minimizes length among all paths connecting $p$ and $q$. Therefore, finding multiple weak harmonic maps with the same boundary data is equivalent to finding a target space $N$ and two points $p, q \\in N$ that are connected by at least two distinct minimizing geodesics.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option based on this principle.\n\n### Option A\n\nThis option proposes the domain $[0,1]$ and the target as the unit circle $S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}$ with its standard round metric. The boundary values are $u(0)=1$ and $u(1)=-1$, which are antipodal points.\n\n1.  **Target Space**: The target space $N=S^1$ is a compact Riemannian manifold. Its sectional curvature is constant and positive, $K=1 > 0$. It is also not simply connected. Therefore, it is not a Hadamard manifold or a $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space. This is a valid setting for a potential counterexample.\n\n2.  **Proposed Maps**: The proposed maps are $\\gamma_{+}(t)=e^{i\\pi t}$ and $\\gamma_{-}(t)=e^{-i\\pi t}$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n    -   **Boundary Conditions**:\n        -   $\\gamma_{+}(0) = e^{i\\pi(0)} = 1$, $\\gamma_{+}(1) = e^{i\\pi(1)} = -1$.\n        -   $\\gamma_{-}(0) = e^{-i\\pi(0)} = 1$, $\\gamma_{-}(1) = e^{-i\\pi(1)} = -1$.\n        Both maps satisfy the prescribed boundary conditions.\n    -   **Distinctness**: For any $t \\in (0,1)$, $e^{i\\pi t} \\neq e^{-i\\pi t}$, so the maps are distinct.\n    -   **Harmonicity and Energy**: To check if they are weak harmonic maps, we verify if they are constant-speed geodesics.\n        -   The velocity vectors are $\\dot{\\gamma}_{+}(t) = i\\pi e^{i\\pi t}$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_{-}(t) = -i\\pi e^{-i\\pi t}$.\n        -   The speeds are $|\\dot{\\gamma}_{+}(t)| = |i\\pi||e^{i\\pi t}| = \\pi$ and $|\\dot{\\gamma}_{-}(t)| = |-i\\pi||e^{-i\\pi t}| = \\pi$.\n        Since the speeds are constant, both curves are constant-speed parametrizations of geodesics (the two semicircles connecting $1$ and $-1$). As constant-speed geodesics, they are weak harmonic maps in $W^{1,2}([0,1], S^1)$.\n    -   **Energy Minimization**: The length of both curves is $L(\\gamma_{\\pm}) = \\int_{0}^{1} |\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\pm}| dt = \\int_{0}^{1} \\pi dt = \\pi$. The distance between antipodal points on the unit circle is $\\pi$, so these are length-minimizing geodesics. The energy functional is $E(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^1 |\\dot{u}|^2 dt$. For a constant-speed curve, this is $E(u) = \\frac{1}{2} L(u)^2$.\n        -   $E(\\gamma_{\\pm}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} \\pi^2 dt = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi^2$.\n        For any other path $u \\in W^{1,2}$ connecting these points, its length $L(u) \\ge \\pi$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, its energy satisfies $E(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^1 |\\dot{u}|^2 dt \\ge \\frac{1}{2} (\\int_0^1 |\\dot{u}| dt)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} L(u)^2 \\ge \\frac{1}{2}\\pi^2$.\n        Thus, $\\gamma_{+}$ and $\\gamma_{-}$ both achieve the minimum possible energy.\n\nThis option correctly identifies two distinct energy-minimizing weak harmonic maps for the same Dirichlet data. This non-uniqueness is a direct consequence of the positive curvature of $S^1$, which allows for multiple minimizing geodesics between antipodal points.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n### Option B\n\nThis option proposes the domain $[0,1]$ and the target $\\mathbb{R}$, with boundary data $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=1$.\n\n1.  **Target Space**: The target space $N=\\mathbb{R}$ is a complete, simply connected manifold with sectional curvature identically zero. It is a Hadamard manifold and a $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space. The uniqueness theorem for energy minimizers applies in this setting. Therefore, this option cannot serve as a counterexample to uniqueness due to failure of non-positive curvature.\n2.  **Proposed Maps**: It suggests two maps: the affine map $u_1(t)=t$ and a \"piecewise constant map that jumps\".\n    -   The map $u_1(t)=t$ is the unique minimizing geodesic between $0$ and $1$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. Its energy is $E(u_1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^1 1^2 dt = \\frac{1}{2}$. It is the unique energy-minimizing weak harmonic map.\n    -   A map with a jump discontinuity is not in the Sobolev space $W^{1,2}([0,1], \\mathbb{R})$, as elements of this space must be absolutely continuous. If we interpret \"jumps\" as a limit of steep functions, such as $u_{\\epsilon}(t)$ which is $0$ on $[0,1-\\epsilon]$ and rises linearly to $1$ on $[1-\\epsilon, 1]$, its derivative is $1/\\epsilon$ on an interval of length $\\epsilon$. The energy is $E(u_{\\epsilon}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{1-\\epsilon}^1 (1/\\epsilon)^2 dt = \\frac{1}{2\\epsilon}$, which diverges to $\\infty$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. Such a map is not an energy minimizer.\n\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. The target space ensures uniqueness, and the proposed second map is not a valid competitor for energy minimization.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Option C\n\nThis option proposes the domain as the unit disk $D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ and the target as a Hadamard manifold $N$. It claims that for any continuous boundary map $f:\\partial D \\to N$, there are always at least two distinct energy-minimizing weak harmonic maps.\n\n1.  **Target Space**: The target $N$ is explicitly defined as a Hadamard manifold (complete, simply connected, $K \\le 0$).\n2.  **Claim**: The statement claims non-uniqueness of energy minimizers. This is a direct contradiction of a fundamental result in the theory of harmonic maps, established by Hartman. The theorem states that for a domain $M$ with boundary $\\partial M$ and a target Hadamard manifold $N$, given a suitable map $f: \\partial M \\to N$, there exists a unique harmonic map $u: M \\to N$ with $u|_{\\partial M} = f$, and this map is the unique minimizer of the energy functional in its homotopy class. The conditions specified in this option are precisely those that guarantee uniqueness.\n\nThis option misstates a major theorem.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Option D\n\nThis option proposes the domain $[0,1]$ and the target as the flat $2$-torus $\\mathbb{T}^2 = \\mathbb{R}^2 / \\mathbb{Z}^2$. The boundary values are $p=[0,0]$ and $q=[\\frac{1}{2},0]$.\n\n1.  **Target Space**: The flat torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$ has sectional curvature identically $0$, so it is non-positively curved. However, it is not simply connected (its fundamental group is $\\mathbb{Z}^2$). Therefore, it is not a Hadamard manifold and not a $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space. This setting is a valid candidate for a counterexample.\n2.  **Proposed Maps**: The maps are $\\gamma_1(t) = [\\frac{t}{2}, 0]$ and $\\gamma_2(t) = [-\\frac{t}{2}, 0]$.\n    -   **Boundary Conditions**:\n        -   $\\gamma_1(0)=[0,0]=p$, $\\gamma_1(1)=[\\frac{1}{2},0]=q$.\n        -   $\\gamma_2(0)=[0,0]=p$, $\\gamma_2(1)=[-\\frac{1}{2},0]$. On the torus, $[-\\frac{1}{2},0]$ is identified with $[-\\frac{1}{2}+1,0] = [\\frac{1}{2},0]=q$.\n        Both maps satisfy the boundary conditions.\n    -   **Distinctness**: For $t \\in (0,1)$, we have $t \\in (0,1)$. The points $[\\frac{t}{2},0]$ and $[-\\frac{t}{2},0]$ are distinct, since $\\frac{t}{2} - (-\\frac{t}{2}) = t$ is not an integer.\n    -   **Harmonicity and Energy**: The maps are projections of straight lines in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to the torus. We check their speed. The lifts to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are $\\tilde{\\gamma}_1(t) = (\\frac{t}{2}, 0)$ and $\\tilde{\\gamma}_2(t) = (-\\frac{t}{2}, 0)$.\n        -   The velocities are $\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}_1(t) = (\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$ and $\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}_2(t) = (-\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$.\n        -   The speeds are constant: $|\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)| = |\\dot{\\gamma}_2(t)| = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n        Both are constant-speed geodesics and thus are weak harmonic maps.\n    -   **Energy Minimization**: The length of both curves is $L(\\gamma_{1,2}) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{2} dt = \\frac{1}{2}$. The distance between $p$ and $q$ on $\\mathbb{T}^2$ is the minimum of $\\sqrt{(\\frac{1}{2}+m)^2 + n^2}$ over integers $m,n$, which is achieved for $m=n=0$, giving a distance of $\\frac{1}{2}$. Both curves are length-minimizing geodesics.\n        -   The energy is $E(\\gamma_{1,2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^1 (\\frac{1}{2})^2 dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n        As constant-speed length-minimizing geodesics, they are both energy minimizers.\n\nThis option correctly identifies two distinct energy-minimizing weak harmonic maps.
