The solution will be constructed in three main steps: first, establishing upper and lower bounds on the volume of geodesic balls using the Bishop-Gromov comparison theorem; second, using a packing argument to relate the covering number to a ratio of volumes; and third, combining these results to derive and evaluate an explicit bound.\n\nLet $(M, g)$ be a complete, connected, $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, so its dimension is $n=3$. The sectional curvature $K$ is bounded by $|K| \\leq 1$, which is equivalent to the two inequalities $-1 \\leq K \\leq 1$. The diameter of the manifold is bounded by $\\operatorname{diam}(M) \\leq D$, with $D=2$. We are asked to find an upper bound on $N(1)$, the minimal number of geodesic balls of radius $r=1$ needed to cover $M$.\n\nThe Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem is a central tool. It relates the volume of geodesic balls in a manifold $M$ to those in a space of constant sectional curvature. Let $V_k(s)$ denote the volume of a geodesic ball of radius $s$ in the simply connected $n$-dimensional space form of constant curvature $k$.\nIf the Ricci curvature on $M$ satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric} \\geq (n-1)kg$, then for any $p \\in M$, the function $s \\mapsto \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}(B_s(p))}{V_k(s)}$ is non-increasing for $s > 0$.\nIf the sectional curvature on $M$ satisfies $K \\leq k'$, then for any $p \\in M$, the function $s \\mapsto \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}(B_s(p))}{V_{k'}(s)}$ is non-decreasing for $s \\in [0, \\pi/\\sqrt{k'}]$ (if $k'>0$). This result is often called Bishop's inequality.\n\nFirst, we estimate $\\operatorname{vol}(B_s(p))$.\nThe lower bound on sectional curvature is $K \\geq -1$. For an $n$-dimensional manifold, if the sectional curvature is bounded below by $k$, i.e., $K \\geq k$, then the Ricci curvature is bounded below by $\\operatorname{Ric} \\geq (n-1)kg$. In our case, $n=3$ and $k=-1$, so $\\operatorname{Ric} \\geq (3-1)(-1)g = -2g$.\nWe can apply the Bishop-Gromov theorem with $k=-1$. The comparison space is the $3$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^3$. The function $s \\mapsto \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}(B_s(p))}{V_{-1}(s)}$ is non-increasing. Since $\\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}(B_s(p))}{V_{-1}(s)} = 1$, we must have $\\frac{\\operatorname{vol}(B_s(p))}{V_{-1}(s)} \\leq 1$ for all $s > 0$. This provides an upper bound on the volume of a ball:\n$$ \\operatorname{vol}(B_s(p)) \\leq V_{-1}(s) $$\nThe volume of a ball of radius $s$ in $\\mathbb{H}^3$ is given by $V_{-1}(s) = \\omega_2 \\int_0^s (\\sinh\\rho)^2 d\\rho$, where $\\omega_2 = 4\\pi$ is the area of the unit $2$-sphere.\n$$ V_{-1}(s) = 4\\pi \\int_0^s \\frac{\\cosh(2\\rho)-1}{2} d\\rho = 2\\pi \\left[\\frac{\\sinh(2\\rho)}{2} - \\rho\\right]_0^s = \\pi(\\sinh(2s) - 2s) $$\n\nThe upper bound on sectional curvature is $K \\leq 1$. We apply Bishop's inequality with the comparison space being the unit $3$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^3$, which has constant curvature $k'=1$. For any $p \\in M$ and for $s \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $\\operatorname{vol}(B_s(p)) \\geq V_1(s)$. This provides a lower bound on the volume of a ball.\nThe volume of a ball of radius $s$ in $\\mathbb{S}^3$ is given by $V_1(s) = \\omega_2 \\int_0^s (\\sin\\rho)^2 d\\rho$:\n$$ V_1(s) = 4\\pi \\int_0^s \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\rho)}{2} d\\rho = 2\\pi \\left[\\rho - \\frac{\\sin(2\\rho)}{2}\\right]_0^s = \\pi(2s - \\sin(2s)) $$\n\nNext, we establish a bound on the covering number $N(1)$ using a packing argument. Let $r=1$ be the radius of the covering balls. Consider a maximal set of points $\\{q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_k\\} \\subset M$ such that the geodesic distance between any two distinct points is at least $r=1$, i.e., $d(q_i, q_j) \\geq 1$ for $i \\neq j$.\nBy the triangle inequality, the open geodesic balls $B_{r/2}(q_j) = B_{1/2}(q_j)$ are pairwise disjoint. If $x \\in B_{1/2}(q_i) \\cap B_{1/2}(q_j)$, then $d(q_i, q_j) \\leq d(q_i, x) + d(x, q_j)  1/2 + 1/2 = 1$, a contradiction.\nSince the set $\\{q_j\\}$ is maximal, any point $p \\in M$ must be within a distance of $r=1$ from at least one $q_j$. If not, $p$ could be added to the set, contradicting its maximality. Thus, the collection of closed balls $\\{B_1(q_j)\\}_{j=1}^k$ forms a cover of $M$.\nThe number of balls in this specific covering is $k$. Therefore, the minimal number of balls, $N(1)$, is bounded above by $k$: $N(1) \\leq k$.\n\nWe now bound $k$. The disjoint balls $B_{1/2}(q_j)$ are all contained within $M$. Therefore, the sum of their volumes is less than or equal to the total volume of $M$:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^k \\operatorname{vol}(B_{1/2}(q_j)) \\leq \\operatorname{vol}(M) $$\nUsing the volume lower bound derived from $K \\leq 1$, we have $\\operatorname{vol}(B_{1/2}(q_j)) \\geq V_1(1/2)$ for all $j$. This holds since the radius $s=1/2$ is less than $\\pi$.\n$$ V_1(1/2) = \\pi(2(1/2) - \\sin(2(1/2))) = \\pi(1 - \\sin(1)) $$\nSubstituting this into the sum, we get:\n$$ k \\cdot V_1(1/2) \\leq \\operatorname{vol}(M) \\implies k \\leq \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}(M)}{V_1(1/2)} $$\nTo get an upper bound for $k$, we need an upper bound for $\\operatorname{vol}(M)$. The diameter of $M$ is bounded by $\\operatorname{diam}(M) \\leq 2$. For any point $p \\in M$, the entire manifold is contained within the ball $B_2(p)$. Thus, $\\operatorname{vol}(M) \\leq \\operatorname{vol}(B_2(p))$.\nUsing the volume upper bound derived from $K \\geq -1$, we have $\\operatorname{vol}(B_2(p)) \\leq V_{-1}(2)$.\n$$ V_{-1}(2) = \\pi(\\sinh(2 \\cdot 2) - 2 \\cdot 2) = \\pi(\\sinh(4) - 4) $$\nSo, we have an upper bound for the total volume: $\\operatorname{vol}(M) \\leq V_{-1}(2)$.\n\nCombining all inequalities, we obtain the upper bound for $N(1)$:\n$$ N(1) \\leq k \\leq \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}(M)}{V_1(1/2)} \\leq \\frac{V_{-1}(2)}{V_1(1/2)} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $V_{-1}(2)$ and $V_1(1/2)$:\n$$ N(1) \\leq \\frac{\\pi(\\sinh(4) - 4)}{\\pi(1 - \\sin(1))} = \\frac{\\sinh(4) - 4}{1 - \\sin(1)} $$\nThis is the desired explicit upper bound expression in terms of special functions.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this bound numerically. The angle $1$ in $\\sin(1)$ is in radians.\nUsing a calculator for the values:\n$\\sinh(4) \\approx 27.289917$\n$\\sin(1) \\approx 0.841471$\nThe value of the bound is:\n$$ N(1) \\leq \\frac{27.289917 - 4}{1 - 0.841471} = \\frac{23.289917}{0.158529} \\approx 146.9113 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $147$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{147}$$", "id": "2970560"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the technique of volume comparison, we now explore the profound connection between geometric constraints and topological properties.

It is a well-posed problem within the established framework of Riemannian geometry. We will now proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine if the genus $g$ of a closed, oriented Riemannian surface $(M,g)$ is controlled by uniform bounds on its sectional curvature and diameter. Specifically, given that the sectional curvature $K$ satisfies $|K| \\le \\Lambda$ and the diameter $\\operatorname{diam}(M) \\le D$, we must derive an upper bound $G(\\Lambda,D)$ for $g$.\n\nOur derivation will proceed in two main steps. First, we will use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to establish a relationship between the genus $g$ and the total area of the surface, $\\operatorname{Area}(M)$. Second, we will use the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem to find an upper bound for $\\operatorname{Area}(M)$ in terms of the given constants $\\Lambda$ and $D$.\n\n**Step 1: Application of the Gauss–Bonnet Theorem**\n\nThe Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a closed, oriented Riemannian surface $M$ states that the integral of its Gaussian curvature $K$ over the entire surface is proportional to its Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$:\n$$ \\int_M K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\chi(M) $$\nwhere $dA$ is the area element induced by the metric $g$. For a closed, oriented surface of genus $g$, the Euler characteristic is given by $\\chi(M) = 2 - 2g$. Substituting this into the Gauss-Bonnet formula, we obtain:\n$$ \\int_M K \\, dA = 2\\pi(2 - 2g) = 4\\pi(1 - g) $$\nWe are given the condition $|K| \\le \\Lambda$, which implies $-\\Lambda \\le K(p) \\le \\Lambda$ for all points $p \\in M$.

Integrating this inequality over $M$ gives:\n$$ \\int_M K \\, dA \\ge \\int_M (-\\Lambda) \\, dA = -\\Lambda \\int_M dA = -\\Lambda \\operatorname{Area}(M) $$\nCombining this with the Gauss-Bonnet result yields:\n$$ 4\\pi(1 - g) \\ge -\\Lambda \\operatorname{Area}(M) $$\nWe can now rearrange this inequality to solve for an upper bound on $g$. Note that the problem specifies $g \\ge 2$, so $1-g$ is negative.\n$$ 4\\pi - 4\\pi g \\ge -\\Lambda \\operatorname{Area}(M) $$\n$$ 4\\pi g \\le 4\\pi + \\Lambda \\operatorname{Area}(M) $$\n$$ g \\le 1 + \\frac{\\Lambda}{4\\pi} \\operatorname{Area}(M) $$\nThis inequality demonstrates that an upper bound on the area of $M$ will provide an upper bound on its genus.\n\n**Step 2: Bounding the Area using Bishop–Gromov Comparison**\n\nTo bound $\\operatorname{Area}(M)$, we employ the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem. For a complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature satisfying $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)k$ for some constant $k$, the theorem states that the ratio of the volume of a geodesic ball $B(p,r)$ in the manifold to the volume of a ball of the same radius $V_{k,n}(r)$ in the $n$-dimensional space form of constant sectional curvature $k$ is a non-increasing function of the radius $r$.\n\nIn our case, $M$ is a $2$-dimensional surface ($n=2$), so the Ricci curvature is simply the sectional (Gaussian) curvature, $\\operatorname{Ric}(X,X) = K(p)$ for a unit tangent vector $X$. The given curvature bound $|K| \\le \\Lambda$ provides the lower bound $K \\ge -\\Lambda$. Therefore, we can apply the Bishop-Gromov theorem with the comparison curvature $k = -\\Lambda$. The theorem implies that for any $p \\in M$ and any radius $r > 0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}(B(p,r))}{V_{-\\Lambda,2}(r)} \\le \\lim_{s \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}(B(p,s))}{V_{-\\Lambda,2}(s)} = 1 $$\nThis gives us the volume bound $\\operatorname{vol}(B(p,r)) \\le V_{-\\Lambda,2}(r)$.\n\nNext, we calculate the volume $V_{-\\Lambda,2}(r)$ of a geodesic ball of radius $r$ in the $2$-dimensional space form of constant sectional curvature $-\\Lambda$ (the hyperbolic plane of curvature $-\\Lambda$). The metric in geodesic polar coordinates is $ds^2 = d\\rho^2 + S_{-\\Lambda}(\\rho)^2 d\\theta^2$, where $S_{-\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\Lambda}\\rho)$.

Let $p$ be an arbitrary point in $M$. By definition of diameter, any point $q \\in M$ is at a distance $d(p,q) \\le \\operatorname{diam}(M)$. Therefore, the entire manifold $M$ is contained within the closed geodesic ball $\\bar{B}(p, \\operatorname{diam}(M))$.
