It is scientifically grounded in the principles of special relativity and Lorentzian geometry, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and stated in objective, formal language. The problem is a standard exercise in calculating the Lorentzian distance between two timelike separated events.\n\nWe are asked to compute the Lorentzian distance $d(p,q)$ between the events $p = (0,0)$ and $q = (3,2)$ in $1+1$-dimensional Minkowski space $\\mathbb{R}^{1,1}$ with the metric $g = -dt^{2} + dx^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we must verify that event $q$ lies in the causal future of event $p$. The displacement four-vector (in this case, two-vector) is $\\Delta v = q-p = (t_q-t_p, x_q-x_p) = (3-0, 2-0) = (3,2)$. Let $\\Delta t = 3$ and $\\Delta x = 2$. The squared spacetime interval between $p$ and $q$ is:\n$$ (\\Delta s)^{2} = g(\\Delta v, \\Delta v) = -(\\Delta t)^{2} + (\\Delta x)^{2} = -(3)^{2} + (2)^{2} = -9 + 4 = -5 $$\nSince $(\\Delta s)^{2}  0$, the interval is timelike. Since $\\Delta t = 3 > 0$, the event $q$ is in the future light cone of $p$. Thus, $q$ is in the causal future of $p$, and the Lorentzian distance $d(p,q)$ will be non-zero.\n\nThe Lorentzian distance $d(p,q)$ is defined as the supremum of the proper time $\\tau(\\gamma)$ over all future-directed causal curves $\\gamma$ from $p$ to $q$. A future-directed causal curve $\\gamma(\\lambda) = (t(\\lambda), x(\\lambda))$ is a piecewise smooth curve with tangent vector $\\dot{\\gamma} = (\\dot{t}, \\dot{x})$ satisfying $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\le 0$ (causality) and $\\dot{t} > 0$ (future-directed). The proper time is given by the functional:\n$$ \\tau(\\gamma) = \\int \\sqrt{-g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})} \\, d\\lambda = \\int \\sqrt{(\\dot{t}(\\lambda))^{2} - (\\dot{x}(\\lambda))^{2}} \\, d\\lambda $$\nWe wish to find the supremum of this value. Let the curve be parameterized such that $\\lambda$ runs from $0$ to $1$. Then, the total coordinate displacements are $\\int_{0}^{1} \\dot{t}(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda = \\Delta t = 3$ and $\\int_{0}^{1} \\dot{x}(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda = \\Delta x = 2$.\n\nWe can establish an upper bound for $\\tau(\\gamma)$ using the reversed Minkowski-Schwarz inequality for integrals, which states that for functions $f(\\lambda)$ and $g(\\lambda)$ satisfying $f(\\lambda) \\ge |g(\\lambda)|$, we have:\n$$ \\left( \\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{f(\\lambda)^{2} - g(\\lambda)^{2}} \\, d\\lambda \\right)^{2} \\le \\left( \\int_{a}^{b} f(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda \\right)^{2} - \\left( \\int_{a}^{b} g(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda \\right)^{2} $$\nThe causality condition $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\le 0$ implies $-(\\dot{t})^{2} + (\\dot{x})^{2} \\le 0$, or $(\\dot{t})^{2} \\ge (\\dot{x})^{2}$. Since $\\dot{t} > 0$, we have $\\dot{t} \\ge |\\dot{x}|$. This allows us to apply the inequality with $f(\\lambda) = \\dot{t}(\\lambda)$ and $g(\\lambda) = \\dot{x}(\\lambda)$.\n$$ (\\tau(\\gamma))^{2} = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} \\sqrt{(\\dot{t})^{2} - (\\dot{x})^{2}} \\, d\\lambda \\right)^{2} \\le \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} \\dot{t} \\, d\\lambda \\right)^{2} - \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} \\dot{x} \\, d\\lambda \\right)^{2} $$\nSubstituting the total displacements:\n$$ (\\tau(\\gamma))^{2} \\le (\\Delta t)^{2} - (\\Delta x)^{2} = 3^{2} - 2^{2} = 9 - 4 = 5 $$\nThis shows that the proper time along any causal path from $p$ to $q$ cannot exceed $\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe supremum is achieved when equality holds in the Minkowski-Schwarz inequality. This occurs when the path is a geodesic, which in flat Minkowski space is a straight line. Let's consider the straight-line path $\\gamma_0(\\lambda) = (t_0(\\lambda), x_0(\\lambda)) = (3\\lambda, 2\\lambda)$ for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$. The tangent vector is constant: $\\dot{\\gamma}_0 = (3,2)$.\nThe proper time along this path is:\n$$ \\tau(\\gamma_0) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sqrt{(\\dot{t}_0)^{2} - (\\dot{x}_0)^{2}} \\, d\\lambda = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sqrt{3^{2} - 2^{2}} \\, d\\lambda = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sqrt{5} \\, d\\lambda = \\sqrt{5} $$\nSince we found a path that achieves the upper bound $\\sqrt{5}$, the supremum of proper times is indeed $\\sqrt{5}$. Therefore, the Lorentzian distance is:\n$$ d(p,q) = \\sqrt{5} $$\nNext, we compute the Euclidean distance $d_{E}(p,q)$ between $p=(0,0)$ and $q=(3,2)$:\n$$ d_{E}(p,q) = \\sqrt{(t_{q} - t_{p})^{2} + (x_{q} - x_{p})^{2}} = \\sqrt{(3-0)^{2} + (2-0)^{2}} = \\sqrt{9+4} = \\sqrt{13} $$\nFinally, we compare the two distances, $d(p,q) = \\sqrt{5}$ and $d_{E}(p,q) = \\sqrt{13}$. The difference arises directly from the structure of the metric tensor, which encodes causality. The Euclidean metric $g_E = dt^{2} + dx^{2}$ is positive-definite, treating time and space coordinates symmetrically. The Euclidean distance is the length of the shortest path between two points (a straight line).\n\nThe Lorentzian metric $g = -dt^{2} + dx^{2}$ has a non-positive-definite signature. The minus sign imposes a fundamental causal structure on spacetime. The causality condition, $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\le 0$, implies that the speed of any physical path, $|v| = |\\dot{x}/\\dot{t}|$, must not exceed the speed of light, which is set to $c=1$. The Lorentzian \"distance\" is not a distance in the metric space sense; it represents the maximum proper time an observer can experience traveling between two events. The maximization of this proper time leads to the reversed triangle inequality: the straight-line (inertial) path between two timelike separated events is the path of longest proper time. Any deviation from this straight line (i.e., any acceleration) results in a shorter elapsed proper time for the traveler. This is the essence of the twin paradox.\n\nThe mathematical expressions make this explicit: $d(p,q)^{2} = (\\Delta t)^{2} - (\\Delta x)^{2}$ while $d_E(p,q)^{2} = (\\Delta t)^{2} + (\\Delta x)^{2}$. The causality constraint, embodied by the minus sign in the metric, is the sole reason for the difference between the two results.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}$$", "id": "2970318"}, {"introduction": "Moving from flat to curved spacetime, this practice explores how gravity affects the propagation of light through the phenomenon of geodesic focusing.

It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of Lorentzian geometry and general relativity. The problem is well-posed, providing a specific metric (a plane-fronted wave with parallel rays, or pp-wave), a specific null geodesic, and a clear definition of the task, which is to find the first conjugate point along this geodesic. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The language is objective and formal. The required analysis involves standard, albeit detailed, calculations from differential geometry.\n\nWe begin by analyzing the geometry of the given spacetime. The metric is\n$$\ng \\;=\\; -2\\,du\\,dv \\;+\\; H(u,x,y)\\,du^{2} \\;+\\; dx^{2} \\;+\\; dy^{2}\n$$\nwith the profile function $H(u,x,y) = -\\omega^{2}\\,(x^{2} + y^{2})$. The coordinates are $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (u,v,x,y)$. The non-zero components of the metric tensor $g_{ab}$ are $g_{uu} = H(u,x,y)$, $g_{uv} = g_{vu} = -1$, $g_{xx}=1$, and $g_{yy}=1$. The inverse metric $g^{ab}$ has non-zero components $g^{uv} = g^{vu} = -1$, $g^{xx}=1$, $g^{yy}=1$, and $g^{vv}=-H(u,x,y)$.\n\nThe specified null geodesic is $\\gamma(\\lambda) = (\\lambda, 0, 0, 0)$, so along $\\gamma$ we have $u(\\lambda)=\\lambda$, $v(\\lambda)=0$, $x(\\lambda)=0$, and $y(\\lambda)=0$. The tangent vector is $k^{a} = \\frac{d\\gamma^{a}}{d\\lambda}$, which has components $k^u=1$ and $k^v=k^x=k^y=0$. We can verify that $\\gamma$ is a null geodesic: $g_{ab}k^a k^b = g_{uu}k^u k^u + 2g_{uv}k^u k^v = H(\\lambda,0,0)(1)^2 + 2(-1)(1)(0) = 0$, since $H(\\lambda,0,0)=0$.\n\nTo use the Jacobi equation, we first need to compute the Riemann curvature tensor components $R^{a}{}_{bcd}$ along the geodesic $\\gamma$. A convenient way to do this is to first compute the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^{a}_{bc}$. Along $\\gamma$, we have $x=0$ and $y=0$. The profile function $H = -\\omega^2(x^2+y^2)$ has the following properties along $\\gamma$:\n$$\nH|_\\gamma = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}|_\\gamma = -2\\omega^2 x|_\\gamma = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}|_\\gamma = -2\\omega^2 y|_\\gamma = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial u}|_\\gamma = 0\n$$\nSince all first derivatives of the metric components vanish along $\\gamma$, all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^{a}_{bc}|_{\\gamma}$ are zero. This simplifies the Jacobi equation significantly.\n\nThe Jacobi equation is $\\frac{D^{2} J^{a}}{d\\lambda^{2}} \\;+\\; R^{a}{}_{bcd}\\,k^{b} J^{c} k^{d} = 0$.\nThe covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ is $\\frac{DJ^a}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{dJ^a}{d\\lambda} + \\Gamma^a_{bc} k^b J^c$. Since $\\Gamma^a_{bc}|_\\gamma = 0$, this simplifies to $\\frac{DJ^a}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{dJ^a}{d\\lambda}$.\nConsequently, the second covariant derivative is $\\frac{D^2J^a}{d\\lambda^2} = \\frac{d^2J^a}{d\\lambda^2}$.\nThe tangent vector is $k^a = (1,0,0,0)^T$, so the Jacobi equation along $\\gamma$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2} J^{a}}{d\\lambda^{2}} \\;+\\; R^{a}{}_{ucu d}|_{\\gamma} J^{c} \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nThe Riemann tensor formula is $R^a{}_{bcd} = \\partial_c \\Gamma^a_{db} - \\partial_d \\Gamma^a_{cb} + \\Gamma^a_{c e}\\Gamma^e_{db} - \\Gamma^a_{d e}\\Gamma^e_{cb}$. Since the Christoffel symbols vanish on $\\gamma$, the quadratic terms also vanish. The expression simplifies to $R^a{}_{bcd}|_\\gamma = \\left(\\partial_c \\Gamma^a_{db} - \\partial_d \\Gamma^a_{cb}\\right)|_\\gamma$.\n\nWe need the components of the \"tidal tensor\" $\\mathcal{R}^{a}{}_{c} \\equiv R^{a}{}_{ucu c}|_{\\gamma}$. The relevant Christoffel symbols are $\\Gamma^x_{uu} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{xx}\\partial_x g_{uu} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_x H$ and $\\Gamma^y_{uu} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{yy}\\partial_y g_{uu} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_y H$. All other $\\Gamma^a_{bc}$ that could contribute are zero even before evaluating on the geodesic, or their relevant derivatives vanish.\nFor example, a component like $R^u{}_{uxu}$ involves $\\Gamma^u_{uu}$ and $\\Gamma^u_{xu}$, which are identically zero. A component like $R^v{}_{uxu}$ would involve derivatives of $\\Gamma^v_{uu}$ and $\\Gamma^v_{xu}$, which depend on $\\partial_u H$ and $\\partial_x H$. Since $\\partial_u H$ is identically zero and $\\partial_x H$ is zero on $\\gamma$, these curvature components are zero. The only non-vanishing components are in the transverse space $(x,y)$.\n\nLet's compute the transverse components:\n$R^{x}{}_{uxu}|_{\\gamma} = (\\partial_x \\Gamma^x_{uu} - \\partial_u \\Gamma^x_{xu})|_{\\gamma}$. We know $\\Gamma^x_{xu} = \\Gamma^x_{ux}=0$. So, $R^{x}{}_{uxu}|_{\\gamma} = \\partial_x(-\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_x H)|_{\\gamma} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_x^2 H|_{\\gamma}$.\n$R^{y}{}_{uyu}|_{\\gamma} = (\\partial_y \\Gamma^y_{uu} - \\partial_u \\Gamma^y_{yu})|_{\\gamma} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_y^2 H|_{\\gamma}$.\n$R^{x}{}_{uyu}|_{\\gamma} = (\\partial_y \\Gamma^x_{uu} - \\partial_u \\Gamma^x_{yu})|_{\\gamma} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_y\\partial_x H|_{\\gamma}$.\nThe second partial derivatives of $H = -\\omega^2(x^2+y^2)$ are: $\\partial_x^2 H = -2\\omega^2$, $\\partial_y^2 H = -2\\omega^2$, and $\\partial_x\\partial_y H=0$. These are constant everywhere.\nSo, the non-zero tidal tensor components are:\n$$\nR^{x}{}_{uxu}|_{\\gamma} = -\\frac{1}{2}(-2\\omega^2) = \\omega^2\n$$\n$$\nR^{y}{}_{uyu}|_{\\gamma} = -\\frac{1}{2}(-2\\omega^2) = \\omega^2\n$$\nThe Jacobi equations for the components of $J^a = (J^u, J^v, J^x, J^y)$ become:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 J^u}{d\\lambda^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{d^2 J^v}{d\\lambda^2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 J^x}{d\\lambda^2} + \\omega^2 J^x = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 J^y}{d\\lambda^2} + \\omega^2 J^y = 0\n$$\nThese equations are subject to the orthogonality condition $g_{ab} k^a J^b = 0$. Along $\\gamma$, this is $g_{uv}k^u J^v = (-1)(1)J^v = -J^v = 0$, so $J^v(\\lambda) = 0$ for all $\\lambda$. This is consistent with its equation of motion and initial conditions (since $E_0^a$ must also be orthogonal to $k^a$, $E_0^v=0$).\nThe initial conditions are $J^a(0)=0$ and $\\frac{dJ^a}{d\\lambda}(0) = E_0^a$. A conjugate point $\\gamma(\\lambda_c)$ exists if $J^a(\\lambda_c)=0$ for a non-trivial Jacobi field.\nFrom $\\frac{d^2 J^u}{d\\lambda^2}=0$ with $J^u(0)=0$ and $\\frac{dJ^u}{d\\lambda}(0)=E_0^u$, we get $J^u(\\lambda) = E_0^u \\lambda$. For a conjugate point to exist at $\\lambda_c > 0$, we must have $J^u(\\lambda_c)=0$, which implies $E_0^u=0$. Therefore, to find a conjugate point, we must consider an initial deviation vector $E_0^a$ purely in the transverse space, i.e., $E_0^u=E_0^v=0$. Since $E_0^a$ must be non-zero, at least one of $E_0^x$ or $E_0^y$ must be non-zero.\n\nThe transverse Jacobi equations are those of a simple harmonic oscillator. The solution for $J^x(\\lambda)$ with\ninitial conditions $J^x(0)=0$ and $\\frac{dJ^x}{d\\lambda}(0) = E_0^x$ is:\n$$\nJ^x(\\lambda) = \\frac{E_0^x}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega\\lambda)\n$$\nSimilarly, for $J^y(\\lambda)$:\n$$\nJ^y(\\lambda) = \\frac{E_0^y}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega\\lambda)\n$$\nA conjugate point occurs at $\\lambda_c>0$ where $J^a(\\lambda_c)=0$. This requires $J^x(\\lambda_c)=0$ and $J^y(\\lambda_c)=0$. Since we require a non-trivial Jacobi field, $(E_0^x, E_0^y) \\neq (0,0)$. Thus, both equations are satisfied if and only if $\\sin(\\omega\\lambda_c)=0$.\nThis condition implies $\\omega\\lambda_c = n\\pi$ for an integer $n$. The earliest positive value for $\\lambda_c$ corresponds to $n=1$.\nTherefore, the first conjugate point occurs at $\\lambda_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}$.\n\nCausal Significance: The existence of conjugate points on a null geodesic has profound implications for the causal structure of spacetime. A Jacobi field $J^a(\\lambda)$ represents the separation vector between infinitesimally nearby geodesics. The conditions $J^a(0)=0$ and $\\frac{dJ^a}{d\\lambda}|_{0} \\neq 0$ describe a congruence of null geodesics emanating from a single point $\\gamma(0)$ and initially diverging. A conjugate point $\\gamma(\\lambda_c)$, where $J^a(\\lambda_c)=0$, is a point where these geodesics reconverge, or focus. This focusing is caused by the spacetime curvature, represented by the $R_{abcd}$ term in the Jacobi equation. In this problem, the positive terms $\\omega^2 J^x$ and $\\omega^2 J^y$ indicate a focusing (attractive) effect.\n\nThe boundary of the causal future of a point $p$, denoted $\\partial I^+(p)$, is generated by null geodesics starting at $p$. If a null geodesic generator $\\gamma$ of this boundary has a point $q=\\gamma(\\lambda_c)$ that is conjugate to $p=\\gamma(0)$, then $\\gamma$ ceases to form the boundary of $I^+(p)$ for all points beyond $q$. The focusing of null geodesics allows timelike curves from $p$ to \"go around\" $\\gamma$ and reach events on the geodesic past $q$. This means points on $\\gamma$ with parameter $\\lambda > \\lambda_c$ lie in the interior of the causal future, $I^+(p)$, not on its boundary. The collection of conjugate points forms caustics, where the intensity of light would diverge in the approximation of geometric optics. The occurrence of such focusing is a key ingredient in the Penrose singularity theorem, which states that under generic conditions (including a suitable trapping condition for null geodesics), spacetime must be null geodesically incomplete.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}}\n$$", "id": "2970325"}, {"introduction": "This final practice shifts focus from individual geodesics to the global causal structure of spacetime, which is essential for a well-posed initial value formulation in general relativity.

I will proceed with the detailed solution.\n\n### Solution and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem asks to identify the correct statement among the given options concerning the consequences of a set $S$ not being achronal. A key concept in the initial value formulation of general relativity is that of a Cauchy surface, which is an achronal set whose domain of dependence is the entire spacetime, $D(S) = M$. If $S$ is a Cauchy surface, $(M,g)$ is globally hyperbolic. The problem explores what happens when the achronality condition is dropped.\n\n**A. Let $M = \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the Minkowski metric $g = -dt^{2} + dx^{2}$, and let $S = \\{(t,x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : x = 0\\}$. Then $S$ is not achronal. Moreover, $D(S) = M$, but $(D(S),g)$ is not globally hyperbolic because it contains inextendible timelike lines.**\n\n-   **Analysis of $S$**: The set $S$ is the time axis. Let $p_1 = (t_1, 0)$ and $p_2 = (t_2, 0)$ be two distinct points in $S$, with $t_2 > t_1$. The straight line segment connecting them is a future-directed timelike curve, since its tangent vector is $(1, 0)$ (after reparametrization), which has a squared norm of $-1^2 + 0^2 = -1  0$. Therefore, $S$ is **not achronal**. This part is correct.\n-   **Analysis of $D(S)$**: The definition of $D(S)$ requires that *every* inextendible causal curve through a point $p \\in D(S)$ must intersect $S$. Consider a point $p = (t_p, x_p)$ with $x_p \\neq 0$. The curve $\\gamma(s) = (s, x_p)$ is an inextendible timelike curve passing through $p$ (at $s=t_p$). This curve is a line parallel to the $t$-axis and never intersects $S$ (the line $x=0$). Because we have found an inextendible causal curve through $p$ that does not intersect $S$, the point $p$ is not in $D(S)$. This holds for any point not on the $t$-axis. Therefore, $D(S) = S$. The claim that $D(S) = M$ is false.\n-   **Conclusion**: Since a key part of the statement, $D(S)=M$, is false, the option is incorrect.\n\n**B. Let $M = \\mathbb{R}_{x} \\times \\mathbb{S}^{1}_{t}$ be the flat Lorentzian cylinder with metric $g = -dt^{2} + dx^{2}$, where $t$ is periodic with period $1$. Let $S = \\{(x,[t]) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{S}^{1} : [t] = [0]\\}$. Then $S$ is not achronal. Moreover, $D(S) = M$, but $(D(S),g)$ is not globally hyperbolic because strong causality fails due to the presence of closed timelike curves.**\n\n-   **Analysis of $S$**: The set $S$ is the circle at $t=0$. Let $p_1 = (x_1, [0])$ and $p_2 = (x_2, [0])$ be two distinct points in $S$ such that $|x_2 - x_1|  1$. Consider the curve $\\gamma(\\tau) = (x_1 + (x_2-x_1)\\tau, [\\tau])$ for $\\tau \\in [0, 1]$. This curve starts at $\\gamma(0)=(x_1, [0])=p_1$ and ends at $\\gamma(1)=(x_2, [1])=(x_2, [0])=p_2$. The tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma} = (x_2-x_1, 1)$. Its squared norm is $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) = -1^2 + (x_2-x_1)^2$. Since $|x_2-x_1|  1$, we have $(x_2-x_1)^2  1$, so $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})  0$. The curve is a future-directed timelike curve connecting two distinct points in $S$. Therefore, $S$ is **not achronal**. This part is correct.\n-   **Analysis of $D(S)$**: An inextendible causal curve in $M$ can be lifted to an inextendible causal curve in its universal covering space, $(\\mathbb{R}^2, g)$. In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, these are infinite straight lines with slope $|dx/dt| \\le 1$. Any such line, being infinite in the time direction, will eventually pass through all values of $t$. In particular, it will intersect the lines $t=n$ for all integers $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. When projected back to the cylinder $M$, this means the original curve intersects the set $S$ (where $[t]=[0]$) infinitely many times. Since this is true for any inextendible causal curve through any point $p \\in M$, we conclude that $D(S) = M$. This part is correct.\n-   **Analysis of Global Hyperbolicity**: The spacetime $M$ (the flat cylinder) contains closed timelike curves (CTCs). For any $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the curve $\\gamma(\\tau) = (x_0, [\\tau])$ for $\\tau \\in [0,1]$ is a CTC. A spacetime with CTCs is not causal, and therefore not strongly causal. Strong causality is a necessary condition for global hyperbolicity. Thus, $(M,g)$ is not globally hyperbolic. As $D(S)=M$, $(D(S),g|_{D(S)})$ is not globally hyperbolic. The justification given is correct.\n-   **Conclusion**: Every part of this statement is correct.\n\n**C. Let $M = \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the Minkowski metric $g = -dt^{2} + dx^{2}$, and let $S = \\{(t,x) : t = 0\\} \\cup \\{(t,x) : t = 1\\}$. Then $S$ is not achronal, and $D(S)$ fails to be well-defined because many inextendible causal curves intersect $S$ more than once, so there is no consistent notion of predictability from $S$.**\n\n-   **Analysis of $S$**: Let $p_1=(0,0) \\in S$ and $p_2=(1,0) \\in S$. The vector connecting them is $\\Delta v = (1,0)$, and its squared interval is $-(\\Delta t)^2 + (\\Delta x)^2 = -1^2+0^2 = -1  0$. Thus there is a timelike curve connecting $p_1$ and $p_2$. $S$ is **not achronal**. This part is correct.\n-   **Analysis of $D(S)$**: The statement claims \"$D(S)$ fails to be well-defined\". This is mathematically incorrect. The definition of the set $D(S)$ is precise: $D(S) = \\{p \\in M \\mid \\text{every inextendible causal curve through } p \\text{ intersects } S\\}$. This definition can be applied to any set $S$, and it produces a well-defined subset of $M$. Let's compute it. In 2D Minkowski space, inextendible causal curves are infinite straight lines. Any such line will intersect both the hyperplane $t=0$ and the hyperplane $t=1$. Therefore, every inextendible causal curve through any point $p \\in M$ must intersect $S$. This means $D(S) = M$. The set $D(S)$ is well-defined; it is the entire spacetime. The justification given, that curves intersect $S$ more than once, explains why $S$ is not a good surface for initial data (failure of predictability), but it does not mean the set $D(S)$ is ill-defined.\n-   **Conclusion**: The statement that $D(S)$ fails to be well-defined is false. The option is incorrect.\n\n**D. Let $M$ be Misner space (the quotient of a wedge of $2$-dimensional Minkowski space by a Lorentz boost), and let $S$ be a spacelike curve that crosses the Cauchy horizon into the region with closed timelike curves. Then $S$ is not achronal, but $D(S)$ is globally hyperbolic because $S$ intersects every inextendible causal curve exactly once.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: Misner space has a region with closed timelike curves (CTCs) and a Cauchy horizon that separates this region from a globally hyperbolic part. If a set $S$ enters the CTC region, it cannot be achronal. For any point $p \\in S$ inside the CTC region, there is a CTC passing through it. This CTC can be used to connect $p$ to another point $q \\in S$ on the same CTC segment, making $S$ **not achronal**. So the first part of the premise is plausible.\n-   **Contradiction in Justification**: The statement provides a justification for why $D(S)$ would be globally hyperbolic: \"because $S$ intersects every inextendible causal curve exactly once\". This is the definition of a Cauchy surface. A fundamental theorem states that a set is a Cauchy surface if and only if it is achronal and $D(S)=M$. The property of intersecting every inextendible causal curve exactly once *implies* that the set is achronal. This directly contradicts the premise that $S$ is not achronal. A non-achronal set cannot intersect every inextendible causal curve exactly once.\n-   **Further Analysis**: Furthermore, if $S$ enters the CTC region, its domain of dependence $D(S)$ would also contain points in that region. A spacetime region containing CTCs cannot be strongly causal, and thus cannot be globally hyperbolic. The claim that $D(S)$ is globally hyperbolic is false.\n-   **Conclusion**: The option contains a self-contradiction and makes a false claim. It is incorrect.\n\nFinal Summary: Only option B provides a correct example and a correct, consistent justification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2970328"}]}
