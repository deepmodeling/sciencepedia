A point $\\gamma(s_*)$ is conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ along a unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(s)$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(s_*)=0$. The Jacobi field $J$ is further constrained to be orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}$ at all points, i.e., $\\langle J(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s) \\rangle = 0$ for all $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe starting point for this analysis is the geodesic deviation equation, also known as the Jacobi equation:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(s) + R(J(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s))\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = 0 $$\nwhere $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ is the covariant derivative along the curve $\\gamma$, and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n\nThe manifold is specified as having constant sectional curvature $K$. For such a manifold, the Riemann tensor has a specific, simplified form:\n$$ R(X, Y)Z = K(\\langle Y, Z \\rangle X - \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y) $$\nfor any vector fields $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. We apply this formula to the curvature term in the Jacobi equation by setting $X=J(s)$, $Y=\\dot{\\gamma}(s)$, and $Z=\\dot{\\gamma}(s)$:\n$$ R(J(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s))\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = K(\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s) \\rangle J(s) - \\langle J(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s) \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma}(s)) $$\nThe problem states that $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, which means its velocity vector has a constant length of $1$, so $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s) \\rangle = 1$. It is also given that the Jacobi field $J(s)$ is everywhere orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(s)$, which means $\\langle J(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s) \\rangle = 0$. Substituting these two conditions into the expression for the curvature term gives:\n$$ R(J(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s))\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = K(1 \\cdot J(s) - 0 \\cdot \\dot{\\gamma}(s)) = K J(s) $$\nSubstituting this simplified term back into the Jacobi equation yields a much simpler differential equation:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(s) + K J(s) = 0 $$\nTo solve this vector differential equation, we introduce a suitable basis. Let $\\{e_1(s), e_2(s), \\dots, e_n(s)\\}$ be an orthonormal frame of vector fields along $\\gamma(s)$ that is parallel transported along $\\gamma$. We choose this frame such that $e_1(s) = \\dot{\\gamma}(s)$ for all $s$. The condition that the frame is parallel transported means $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} e_i(s) = 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nSince $J(s)$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = e_1(s)$, it must lie in the subspace spanned by $\\{e_2(s), \\dots, e_n(s)\\}$. We can therefore express $J(s)$ as a linear combination:\n$$ J(s) = \\sum_{i=2}^{n} y_i(s) e_i(s) $$\nwhere $y_i(s)$ are scalar functions of the parameter $s$. Now we compute the covariant derivatives of $J(s)$. Since the basis vectors $e_i(s)$ are parallel transported, the covariant derivative acts only on the component functions:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(s) = \\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\frac{dy_i}{ds} e_i(s) $$\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(s) = \\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\frac{d^2y_i}{ds^2} e_i(s) $$\nSubstituting this into the simplified Jacobi equation, we get:\n$$ \\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\frac{d^2y_i}{ds^2} e_i(s) + K \\sum_{i=2}^{n} y_i(s) e_i(s) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\left( \\frac{d^2y_i}{ds^2} + K y_i(s) \\right) e_i(s) = 0 $$\nSince the vectors $\\{e_2(s), \\dots, e_n(s)\\}$ are linearly independent, the coefficient of each must be zero. This decouples the vector equation into a system of $n-1$ identical scalar ordinary differential equations:\n$$ \\frac{d^2y_i}{ds^2} + K y_i(s) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\} $$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. Since $K0$ is given, the characteristic equation $r^2 + K = 0$ has imaginary roots $r = \\pm i\\sqrt{K}$. The general solution for each component $y_i(s)$ is:\n$$ y_i(s) = A_i \\cos(\\sqrt{K} s) + B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{K} s) $$\nwhere $A_i$ and $B_i$ are constants of integration.\n\nThe conditions for a conjugate point are that $J(0)=0$ and $J(s_*)=0$ for some $s_*0$, with $J(s)$ not being identically zero.\nThe condition $J(0)=0$ implies that $y_i(0)=0$ for all $i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}$. Applying this to the general solution:\n$$ y_i(0) = A_i \\cos(0) + B_i \\sin(0) = A_i \\cdot 1 + B_i \\cdot 0 = A_i $$\nThus, we must have $A_i=0$ for all $i$. The solution for a Jacobi field vanishing at $s=0$ must therefore be of the form:\n$$ y_i(s) = B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{K} s) $$\nThe Jacobi field itself is $J(s) = \\left( \\sum_{i=2}^{n} B_i e_i(s) \\right) \\sin(\\sqrt{K} s)$.\nFor $J(s)$ to be a non-trivial field, at least one of the constants $B_i$ must be non-zero. Let's assume this is the case.\n\nNow we apply the second condition, $J(s_*)=0$, for some $s_*0$:\n$$ J(s_*) = \\left( \\sum_{i=2}^{n} B_i e_i(s_*) \\right) \\sin(\\sqrt{K} s_*) = 0 $$\nSince at least one $B_i$ is non-zero, the vector $\\sum_{i=2}^{n} B_i e_i(s_*)$ is a non-zero vector. Therefore, for the entire expression to be zero, the scalar part must vanish:\n$$ \\sin(\\sqrt{K} s_*) = 0 $$\nThis equation holds if the argument of the sine function is an integer multiple of $\\pi$. That is:\n$$ \\sqrt{K} s_* = m \\pi, \\quad \\text{for some integer } m $$\nThe problem asks for conjugate points for $s_*0$, so we must have $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. The sequence of parameter values for conjugate points along the geodesic $\\gamma$ is given by:\n$$ s_{*,m} = \\frac{m \\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}, \\quad m = 1, 2, 3, \\dots $$\nThe first conjugate point corresponds to the smallest positive value of $s_*$, which occurs for $m=1$:\n$$ s_{*,1} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} $$\nSubsequent conjugate points occur at integer multiples of this fundamental distance. The distance between the $m$-th and $(m+1)$-th conjugate point is:\n$$ s_{*, m+1} - s_{*, m} = \\frac{(m+1)\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} - \\frac{m\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} $$\nThis demonstrates that subsequent conjugate points occur at equal parameter separations, a direct consequence of the periodic nature of the solution to the harmonic oscillator equation governing the Jacobi field components. The period of oscillation is determined by the constant curvature $K$.\n\nThe parameter distance to the first conjugate point along $\\gamma$ is thus $\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}}$$", "id": "2976440"}, {"introduction": "Having established the geometric principle of focusing, we now apply it to a concrete physical scenario within General Relativity.

We begin by stating the fundamental relations.\n\nThe convergence $\\kappa$ is the projected surface mass density $\\Sigma$ scaled by the critical surface density $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$\n\\kappa(R) = \\frac{\\Sigma(R)}{\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}}\n$$\nThe surface mass density $\\Sigma(R)$ is obtained by integrating the three-dimensional density profile $\\rho(r)$ along the line of sight ($z$-axis), where $r^2 = R^2 + z^2$ and $R$ is the projected radius in the lens plane:\n$$\n\\Sigma(R) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho(\\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}) dz\n$$\nFor a circularly symmetric lens, the tangential shear $\\gamma_t$ is related to the convergence $\\kappa(R)$ and the average convergence $\\bar{\\kappa}(R)$ within a radius $R$ by:\n$$\n\\gamma_t(R) = \\bar{\\kappa}(R) - \\kappa(R)\n$$\nThe average convergence $\\bar{\\kappa}(R)$ is the mean of $\\kappa(R')$ over a circular area of radius $R$:\n$$\n\\bar{\\kappa}(R) = \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2} \\int_0^R 2\\pi R' \\kappa(R') dR' = \\frac{2}{R^2} \\int_0^R R' \\kappa(R') dR'\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $\\bar{\\kappa}(R) = \\bar{\\Sigma}(R) / \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, where $\\bar{\\Sigma}(R)$ is the average surface mass density within radius $R$.\n\n### Part 1: Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS)\n\nThe three-dimensional density profile for an SIS is given by:\n$$\n\\rho(r) = \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{2\\pi G r^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_v$ is the one-dimensional velocity dispersion and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nFirst, we calculate the surface mass density $\\Sigma(R)$ by projecting $\\rho(r)$:\n$$\n\\Sigma(R) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{2\\pi G (R^2+z^2)} dz = \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{2\\pi G} \\left[ \\frac{1}{R} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{z}{R}\\right) \\right]_{z=-\\infty}^{z=\\infty}\n$$\n$$\n\\Sigma(R) = \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{2\\pi G R} (\\frac{\\pi}{2} - (-\\frac{\\pi}{2})) = \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{2GR}\n$$\nThe convergence $\\kappa(R)$ is then:\n$$\n\\kappa(R) = \\frac{\\Sigma(R)}{\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{2GR\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}}\n$$\nNext, we find the average convergence $\\bar{\\kappa}(R)$. We can first find the average surface density $\\bar{\\Sigma}(R)$:\n$$\nM(R) = \\int_0^R 2\\pi R' \\Sigma(R') dR' = \\int_0^R 2\\pi R' \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{2GR'}\\right) dR' = \\frac{\\pi\\sigma_v^2}{G} \\int_0^R dR' = \\frac{\\pi\\sigma_v^2 R}{G}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{\\Sigma}(R) = \\frac{M(R)}{\\pi R^2} = \\frac{\\pi\\sigma_v^2 R/G}{\\pi R^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{GR}\n$$\nSo, the average convergence is:\n$$\n\\bar{\\kappa}(R) = \\frac{\\bar{\\Sigma}(R)}{\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{GR\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the tangential shear $\\gamma_t(R)$:\n$$\n\\gamma_t(R) = \\bar{\\kappa}(R) - \\kappa(R) = \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{GR\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}} - \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{2GR\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{2GR\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}}\n$$\nFor the SIS profile, we find that the convergence and tangential shear are equal: $\\kappa(R) = \\gamma_t(R) = \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{2GR\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}}$.\n\n### Part 2: Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) Profile\n\nThe NFW profile has a three-dimensional density given by:\n$$\n\\rho(r) = \\frac{\\rho_s}{\\left(\\frac{r}{r_s}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_s}\\right)^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_s$ is a scale density and $r_s$ is a scale radius. We introduce the dimensionless radius $x \\equiv R/r_s$.\n\nThe calculation of the projected surface density $\\Sigma(x)$ and the mean enclosed surface density $\\bar{\\Sigma}(x)$ are standard but lengthy derivations. We state the established results.\nThe surface density is $\\Sigma(x) = 2\\rho_s r_s f(x)$, where the function $f(x)$ is given by:\n$$\nf(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{x^2-1}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\arccos x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\right)  x1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{3}  x=1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{x^2-1}\\left(1-\\frac{\\arccosh x}{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}\\right)  x1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nUsing the definitions $\\kappa(x) = \\Sigma(x)/\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ and $\\kappa_s = \\rho_s r_s / \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, we find the convergence for the NFW profile:\n$$\n\\kappa(x) = 2\\kappa_s f(x)\n$$\nExplicitly:\n$$\n\\kappa(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{2\\kappa_s}{1-x^2}\\left(\\frac{\\arccos x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}-1\\right)  x1 \\\\ \\frac{2\\kappa_s}{3}  x=1 \\\\ \\frac{2\\kappa_s}{x^2-1}\\left(1-\\frac{\\arccosh x}{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}\\right)  x1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe value $f(1)=1/3$ is confirmed by direct evaluation of the projection integral at $R=r_s$.\n\nNext, we require the average convergence $\\bar{\\kappa}(x)$. The mean enclosed surface density is given by $\\bar{\\Sigma}(x) = 4\\rho_s r_s h(x)$, where $h(x)$ is:\n$$\nh(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) + H(x)\\right) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad H(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\arccos x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}  x1 \\\\ 1  x=1 \\\\ \\frac{\\arccosh x}{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}  x1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe average convergence is therefore $\\bar{\\kappa}(x) = 4\\kappa_s h(x)$:\n$$\n\\bar{\\kappa}(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{4\\kappa_s}{x^2}\\left(\\ln(x/2) + \\frac{\\arccos x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\right)  x1 \\\\ 4\\kappa_s(1-\\ln(2))  x=1 \\\\ \\frac{4\\kappa_s}{x^2}\\left(\\ln(x/2) + \\frac{\\arccosh x}{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}\\right)  x1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe value at $x=1$ is found by taking the limit: $\\lim_{x\\to1} H(x)=1$.\n\nThe tangential shear is $\\gamma_t(x) = \\bar{\\kappa}(x) - \\kappa(x) = 4\\kappa_s h(x) - 2\\kappa_s f(x)$. This gives:\n$$\n\\gamma_t(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{4\\kappa_s}{x^2}\\left(\\ln(x/2) + \\frac{\\arccos x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\right) - \\frac{2\\kappa_s}{1-x^2}\\left(\\frac{\\arccos x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}-1\\right)  x1 \\\\ 4\\kappa_s(1-\\ln(2)) - \\frac{2\\kappa_s}{3}  x=1 \\\\ \\frac{4\\kappa_s}{x^2}\\left(\\ln(x/2) + \\frac{\\arccosh x}{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}\\right) - \\frac{2\\kappa_s}{x^2-1}\\left(1-\\frac{\\arccosh x}{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}\\right)  x1 \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Evaluation of NFW Tangential Shear at the Scale Radius\n\nThe final task is to evaluate the tangential shear $\\gamma_t(x)$ at the scale radius, i.e., at $x=1$. We use the expressions derived for $\\bar{\\kappa}(1)$ and $\\kappa(1)$:\n$$\n\\kappa(1) = \\frac{2\\kappa_s}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{\\kappa}(1) = 4\\kappa_s (1-\\ln(2))\n$$\nThe tangential shear at $x=1$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\gamma_t(1) = \\bar{\\kappa}(1) - \\kappa(1) = 4\\kappa_s (1-\\ln(2)) - \\frac{2\\kappa_s}{3}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\n\\gamma_t(1) = \\kappa_s \\left( 4 - 4\\ln(2) - \\frac{2}{3} \\right) = \\kappa_s \\left( \\frac{12-2}{3} - 4\\ln(2) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_t(1) = \\kappa_s \\left( \\frac{10}{3} - 4\\ln(2) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required simplified analytic expression for the NFW tangential shear at the scale radius.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\kappa_{s} \\left( \\frac{10}{3} - 4\\ln(2) \\right)}$$", "id": "2976452"}]}
