The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information ($a=3$, $b=2$, $\\gamma=\\pi/3$) to define a unique comparison triangle and thus find a unique, sharp upper bound for $c$. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria listed in the prompt.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nLet $\\Delta$ be the geodesic triangle in the CAT$(0)$ space $\\left(X,d\\right)$ with vertices $p$, $x$, and $y$. The lengths of the sides are given as $d(p,x) = a = 3$, $d(p,y) = b = 2$, and $d(x,y) = c$. The interior angle at vertex $p$ is $\\gamma = \\pi/3$.\n\nThe definition of a CAT$(0)$ space is based on a comparison with the model space of constant curvature $k=0$, which is the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{E}^2$. For any geodesic triangle $\\Delta$ in $X$, we construct a corresponding comparison triangle $\\bar{\\Delta}$ in $\\mathbb{E}^2$.\n\nSpecifically for the given triangle $\\Delta$, we construct a comparison triangle $\\bar{\\Delta}$ in $\\mathbb{E}^2$ with vertices $\\bar{p}$, $\\bar{x}$, and $\\bar{y}$. This comparison triangle is defined to have two sides and the included angle identical to those of $\\Delta$. That is, the lengths of the sides adjacent to vertex $\\bar{p}$ are $d_E(\\bar{p}, \\bar{x}) = a = 3$ and $d_E(\\bar{p}, \\bar{y}) = b = 2$, and the angle at $\\bar{p}$ is $\\bar{\\gamma} = \\gamma = \\pi/3$. Here, $d_E$ denotes the standard Euclidean distance. Let the length of the third side of this Euclidean triangle be $\\bar{c} = d_E(\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})$.\n\nThe CAT$(0)$ inequality, one of the fundamental consequences of the CAT$(0)$ axiom (often called the \"thin triangle\" property or Toponogov's theorem for metric spaces), states that for any geodesic triangle in the space $X$, the length of any one side is less than or equal to the length of the corresponding side in its Euclidean comparison triangle. Applying this to the side of length $c$, we have:\n$$\nc = d(x,y) \\le d_E(\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}) = \\bar{c}\n$$\nThis inequality establishes that $\\bar{c}$ is an upper bound for $c$. To show that this is a *sharp* upper bound, denoted $c_{\\ast}$, we must demonstrate that this bound can be attained or approached arbitrarily closely. The Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{E}^2$ is itself a complete geodesic CAT$(0)$ space. If we choose $X = \\mathbb{E}^2$, then the geodesic triangle $\\Delta$ is a standard Euclidean triangle, and we have $c = \\bar{c}$. Therefore, the bound is attainable, which confirms that it is the sharpest possible upper bound. Thus, $c_{\\ast} = \\bar{c}$.\n\nOur task reduces to calculating the length $\\bar{c}$ of the third side of the Euclidean triangle $\\bar{\\Delta}$. We can use the Law of Cosines in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{E}^2$:\n$$\n\\bar{c}^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(\\bar{\\gamma})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $a=3$, $b=2$, and $\\bar{\\gamma}=\\pi/3$:\n$$\n\\bar{c}^2 = 3^2 + 2^2 - 2(3)(2)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\n$$\nThe cosine of $\\pi/3$ is a standard value:\n$$\n\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\bar{c}^2$:\n$$\n\\bar{c}^2 = 9 + 4 - 2(3)(2)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{c}^2 = 13 - 6\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{c}^2 = 7\n$$\nTaking the square root to find the length $\\bar{c}$:\n$$\n\\bar{c} = \\sqrt{7}\n$$\nSince the sharp upper bound is $c_{\\ast} = \\bar{c}$, we conclude that $c_{\\ast} = \\sqrt{7}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{7}}\n$$", "id": "2970197"}, {"introduction": "A powerful consequence of the $\\mathrm{CAT}(k)$ condition is the well-behaved nature of metric projections onto closed convex sets, a property with far-reaching implications in optimization and analysis.

The space is the upper half-plane model with the metric $ds^{2} = \\frac{dx^{2} + dy^{2}}{y^{2}}$, which is a $\\operatorname{CAT}(-1)$ space. The points are $A=(0,1)$, $B=(0,5)$, and $P=(3,4)$. The segment $[A,B]$ lies on the vertical geodesic defined by $x=0$.\n\nFirst, we determine the metric projection of $P$ onto the closed geodesic segment $[A,B]$. In a $\\operatorname{CAT}(k)$ space, the metric projection of a point onto a closed convex set exists and is unique. A geodesic segment is a closed convex set. The projection is the point on the set that is closest to the given point.\n\nLet $L$ be the complete geodesic containing the segment $[A,B]$. In the upper half-plane model, this is the vertical line $\\{x=0\\}$. The projection of $P$ onto $L$ is the point $Q_L \\in L$ such that the geodesic segment $[P, Q_L]$ is orthogonal to $L$. Geodesics in $\\mathbb{H}^2$ are Euclidean semicircles with centers on the real axis, or vertical lines. A geodesic is orthogonal to the vertical line $x=0$ if and only if it is a semicircle centered at the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nThe geodesic through $P=(3,4)$ that is orthogonal to $L$ must therefore be a semicircle centered at the origin. Its equation is of the form $x^2+y^2=R^2$. Since it must pass through $P=(3,4)$, we can find the radius $R$:\n$$3^2 + 4^2 = R^2 \\implies 9 + 16 = 25 = R^2$$\nThus, the geodesic arc is part of the circle $x^2+y^2=25$ with $y0$. To find the projection point $Q_L$ on the line $L=\\{x=0\\}$, we find the intersection of this semicircle with $L$:\n$$0^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies y=5 \\quad (\\text{since } y0)$$\nSo, the projection of $P$ onto the entire geodesic line $L$ is $Q_L = (0,5)$.\n\nNow, we consider the projection onto the segment $[A,B]$, where $A=(0,1)$ and $B=(0,5)$. In a $\\operatorname{CAT}(k)$ space, the projection onto a geodesic segment is found by first projecting onto the full geodesic line. If this projection point lies within the segment, it is the desired projection. If it lies outside the segment, the projection is the closest endpoint of the segment.\nIn our case, the projection point $Q_L=(0,5)$ is precisely the endpoint $B$ of the segment $[A,B]$. Therefore, $Q_L$ lies on the segment, and the metric projection of $P$ onto $[A,B]$ is $Q = B = (0,5)$.\n\nSecond, we verify the orthogonality condition at the projection point $Q=B=(0,5)$. The projection $Q$ of a point $P$ onto a convex set $C$ is uniquely characterized by the condition that for any other point $X \\in C$, the Alexandrov angle at $Q$ subtended by $P$ and $X$, denoted $\\angle_Q(P,X)$, satisfies $\\angle_Q(P,X) \\ge \\pi/2$.\n\nSince the projection point is an endpoint, $Q=B=(0,5)$, the directions \"into\" the convex set $[A,B]$ are all along the geodesic segment towards the other endpoint, $A=(0,1)$. Thus, we must verify the condition for $X=A$. We need to show that $\\angle_B(P,A) \\ge \\pi/2$.\n\nIn a smooth Riemannian manifold like $\\mathbb{H}^2$, the Alexandrov angle is the standard angle between the tangent vectors of the geodesics at the point of intersection. Since the upper half-plane metric is conformal to the Euclidean metric, hyperbolic angles are identical to Euclidean angles.\nThe geodesic segment $[B,A]$ lies on the vertical line $x=0$. The tangent vector to this geodesic at $B=(0,5)$ pointing towards $A=(0,1)$ is in the Euclidean direction $(0,-1)$.\nThe geodesic segment $[B,P]$ lies on the semicircle $x^2+y^2=25$. The tangent to this circle at a point $(x,y)$ is orthogonal to the radial vector $(x,y)$. At $B=(0,5)$, the radial vector is $(0,5)$. An orthogonal vector, representing the tangent, is $(1,0)$ (or $(-1,0)$). The tangent line is horizontal.\nThe angle between the vertical tangent vector $(0,-1)$ and the horizontal tangent vector $(1,0)$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians.\nSince $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the angle condition is satisfied. This confirms that $B=(0,5)$ is indeed the metric projection.\n\nFinally, we compute the hyperbolic distance from $P$ to the segment $[A,B]$, which is the distance from $P$ to its projection $Q=B$.\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}^{2}}(P, [A,B]) = d_{\\mathbb{H}^{2}}(P, B) = d_{\\mathbb{H}^{2}}((3,4), (0,5))$$\nThe distance formula for two points $P_1=(x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2=(x_2, y_2)$ in $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is:\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}^{2}}(P_1, P_2) = \\arccosh \\left( 1 + \\frac{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}{2 y_1 y_2} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the coordinates of $P=(3,4)$ and $B=(0,5)$:\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}^{2}}(P, B) = \\arccosh \\left( 1 + \\frac{(0-3)^2 + (5-4)^2}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} \\right)$$\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}^{2}}(P, B) = \\arccosh \\left( 1 + \\frac{(-3)^2 + 1^2}{40} \\right)$$\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}^{2}}(P, B) = \\arccosh \\left( 1 + \\frac{9+1}{40} \\right)$$\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}^{2}}(P, B) = \\arccosh \\left( 1 + \\frac{10}{40} \\right) = \\arccosh \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\arccosh \\left( \\frac{5}{4} \\right)$$\nTo find the exact value, we use the identity $\\arccosh(z) = \\ln(z + \\sqrt{z^2 - 1})$ for $z \\ge 1$.\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}^{2}}(P, B) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{5}{4} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2 - 1} \\right)$$\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}^{2}}(P, B) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{5}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16} - \\frac{16}{16}} \\right)$$\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}^{2}}(P, B) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{5}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16}} \\right)$$\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}^{2}}(P, B) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} \\right) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{8}{4} \\right) = \\ln(2)$$\nThus, the exact hyperbolic distance from the point $P$ to the segment $[A,B]$ is $\\ln(2)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\ln(2)}$$", "id": "2970168"}, {"introduction": "Beyond analyzing existing spaces, a central theme in metric geometry is the construction of new ones with controlled curvature properties.

The link at a point $p$ in the interior of the seam $s$:\nA point $p$ in the interior of $s$ lies on the boundary of both $T_1$ and $T_2$.

The space of directions at $p$ pointing into $T_1$ forms a geodesic arc of length $\\pi$. Similarly, the space of directions pointing into $T_2$ is an arc of length $\\pi$. The link at $p$, denoted $\\mathrm{Link}_X(p)$, is the union of these two arcs with their endpoints identified. This forms a metric circle. The total length of this circle is the sum of the lengths of the two arcs: $L(\\mathrm{Link}_X(p)) = \\pi + \\pi = 2\\pi$. Thus, the link is a circle of length $2\\pi$.\n\n2. The link at the endpoint $v_{\\alpha}$ of $s$:\nThe vertex $v_{\\alpha}$ in $X$ is formed by identifying the two vertices from $T_1$ and $T_2$ that have an interior angle of $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.
