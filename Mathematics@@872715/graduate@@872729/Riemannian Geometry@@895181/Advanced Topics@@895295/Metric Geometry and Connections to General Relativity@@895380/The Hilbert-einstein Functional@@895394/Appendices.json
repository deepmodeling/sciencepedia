The manifold is an $n$-dimensional torus $\\mathbb{T}^{n} = \\mathbb{R}^{n} / \\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is a full-rank lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This is a closed (compact and without boundary) manifold.\n2.

The task is to determine $E(g)$ for $(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g)$ using foundational definitions.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in Riemannian geometry. The data provided are sufficient and unambiguous. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nOur objective is to compute $E(g) = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{n}} R_{g} \\, d\\mu_{g}$. This requires determining the scalar curvature $R_g$ of the metric $g$. We will do this by first analyzing the geometry of the covering space $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_E)$, where $g_E$ is the standard Euclidean metric, and then using the properties of the covering map $\\pi$.\n\nLet $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_E)$ be the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. In the standard Cartesian coordinate system $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$, the components of the Euclidean metric tensor $g_E$ are constant, given by $g_{E, ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe first step is to compute the Levi-Civita connection for this metric. The Christoffel symbols of the connection, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$, are given by the formula:\n$$\n\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g_E^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{E, jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{E, il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{E, ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right)\n$$\nHere, $g_E^{kl}$ are the components of the inverse metric, which are also $\\delta^{kl}$. Since the components $g_{E, ij}$ are constants ($1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ otherwise), all their partial derivatives are zero: $\\frac{\\partial g_{E, ij}}{\\partial x^k} = 0$ for all $i,j,k$. Consequently, all the Christoffel symbols are zero:\n$$\n\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the Riemann curvature tensor, whose components $R^l_{ijk}$ in terms of the Christoffel symbols are:\n$$\nR^l_{ijk} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{ik}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{jk}}{\\partial x^i} + \\Gamma^p_{ik} \\Gamma^l_{jp} - \\Gamma^p_{jk} \\Gamma^l_{ip}\n$$\nSince all the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are identically zero, their partial derivatives are also zero. Therefore, every term on the right-hand side is zero, which implies that the components of the Riemann curvature tensor are all zero:\n$$\nR^l_{ijk} = 0\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the Riemann curvature tensor of Euclidean space, $Riem_{g_E}$, is the zero tensor. A manifold with a zero Riemann curvature tensor is called a flat manifold. Thus, $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_E)$ is flat.\n\nNow, we relate the geometry of $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_E)$ to that of the torus $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g)$. The problem states that the metric $g$ on $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is induced by the standard Euclidean metric $g_E$ via the covering projection $\\pi : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{T}^n$. By definition of an induced metric via a covering map, $\\pi$ is a local isometry. This means that for any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that the restriction of $\\pi$ to $U$, denoted $\\pi|_U$, is an isometry from $(U, g_E|_U)$ to its image $(\\pi(U), g|_{\\pi(U)})$.\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor is a local geometric invariant. A key property of isometries is that they preserve the curvature tensor. If $\\phi: (M_1, g_1) \\to (M_2, g_2)$ is an isometry, then $\\phi^* Riem_{g_2} = Riem_{g_1}$. Since $\\pi$ is a local isometry, the curvature tensor $Riem_g$ of the torus at any point $q \\in \\mathbb{T}^n$ must be equal to the curvature tensor $Riem_{g_E}$ of the Euclidean space at any corresponding point $p \\in \\pi^{-1}(q)$. As we have established that $Riem_{g_E}$ is the zero tensor everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, it follows that the Riemann curvature tensor $Riem_g$ of the torus must also be the zero tensor everywhere on $\\mathbb{T}^n$.\n\nFrom the Riemann curvature tensor, we derive the Ricci curvature tensor, $Ric_g$, by a contraction: $(Ric_g)_{ij} = R^k_{ikj}$. Since all components of the Riemann tensor $Riem_g$ are zero, it immediately follows that all components of the Ricci tensor are zero:\n$$\n(Ric_g)_{ij} = 0\n$$\n\nThe scalar curvature, $R_g$, is then obtained by contracting the Ricci tensor with the inverse metric $g^{ij}$:\n$$\nR_g = g^{ij} (Ric_g)_{ij}\n$$\nSince $(Ric_g)_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j$, the scalar curvature is identically zero:\n$$\nR_g = 0\n$$\n\nFinally, we are in a position to calculate the value of the Hilbert–Einstein functional $E(g)$:\n$$\nE(g) = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{n}} R_{g} \\, d\\mu_{g}\n$$\nSubstituting the result $R_g = 0$, we find:\n$$\nE(g) = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{n}} 0 \\cdot d\\mu_{g} = 0\n$$\nThe value of the integral of a function that is identically zero over any domain is zero.

The scalar curvature $R_{g_{hyp}}$ is again constant and given by:\n$$\nR_{g_{hyp}} = n(n-1)(-1) = -n(n-1)\n$$\nSimilar to the first case, the integrand $(R_{g_{hyp}} - 2\\Lambda)$ is constant over $M^{n}$.
