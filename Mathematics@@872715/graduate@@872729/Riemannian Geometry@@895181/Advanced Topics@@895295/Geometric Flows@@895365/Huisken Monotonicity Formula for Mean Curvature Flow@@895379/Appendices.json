The problem's context implies a simplified covariance structure, specifically an isotropic Gaussian where the covariance matrix is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, $\\Sigma = \\sigma^2 I_n$. In this case, $\\det(\\Sigma) = (\\sigma^2)^n$ and $\\Sigma^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} I_n$. The term $(x-\\mu)^T I_n (x-\\mu)$ is simply the squared Euclidean norm $|x-\\mu|^2$.
