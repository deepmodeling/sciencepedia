It asks for a standard derivation based on fundamental principles of tensor calculus and the definition of the Ricci flow. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is scientifically grounded and objective.\n\nWe are given the evolution equation for a one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics $g_{ij}(t)$ under the Ricci flow:\n$$ \\partial_{t} g_{ij} = -2 R_{ij} $$\nwhere $R_{ij}$ denotes the components of the Ricci curvature tensor of the metric $g(t)$. The inverse metric, with components $g^{ij}(t)$, is defined by the identity:\n$$ g^{ik} g_{kj} = \\delta^{i}_{\\; j} $$\nHere, $\\delta^{i}_{\\; j}$ is the Kronecker delta, whose components are constant in any coordinate system. The Einstein summation convention is used, implying a sum over any repeated index pair where one is a superscript and one is a subscript (in this case, the index $k$).\n\nTo derive the evolution law for the inverse metric components $g^{ij}$, we differentiate the defining identity with respect to the parameter $t$.

This operation is, by definition, the raising of the first index of the Ricci tensor, yielding the mixed tensor $R^{i}_{\\; j}$:\n$$ R^{i}_{\\; j} \\equiv g^{ik} R_{kj} $$\nSubstituting this definition into our equation gives:\n$$ (\\partial_{t} g^{ik}) g_{kj} = 2 R^{i}_{\\; j} $$\nOur goal is to solve for the term $\\partial_{t} g^{ik}$. To do this, we must \"invert\" the contraction with $g_{kj}$. This is accomplished by contracting the entire equation with the inverse metric component $g^{jl}$.

Substituting this identity yields:\n$$ (\\partial_{t} g^{ik}) \\delta_{k}^{\\; l} = 2 R^{i}_{\\; j} g^{jl} $$\nContraction with the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{k}^{\\; l}$ has the effect of replacing the index $k$ with $l$.
