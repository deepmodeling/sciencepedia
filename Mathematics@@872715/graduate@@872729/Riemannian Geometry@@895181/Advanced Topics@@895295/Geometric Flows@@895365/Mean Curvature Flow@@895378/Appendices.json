The problem states that the curve evolves by $\\partial_{t}\\gamma=\\kappa\\,\\mathbf{n}$, where $\\kappa$ is the signed curvature and $\\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal. This defining equation for curve shortening flow means that the normal component of the velocity of any point on the curve is equal to the curvature at that point.

We choose the upward-pointing unit normal vector:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{n} = \\frac{(-v'(x), 1)}{\\sqrt{1 + (v'(x))^2}}\n      $$\n    - The signed curvature $\\kappa$ for a graph $y=v(x)$, corresponding to this choice of normal, is given by the formula:\n      $$\n      \\kappa = \\frac{v''(x)}{(1 + (v'(x))^2)^{3/2}}\n      $$\n\n3.  **Normal Velocity**: The normal velocity is the projection of the velocity vector $\\partial_t \\gamma$ onto the unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$:\n    $$\n    \\text{Normal Velocity} = (\\partial_t \\gamma) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = (0, c) \\cdot \\frac{(-v'(x), 1)}{\\sqrt{1 + (v'(x))^2}} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{1 + (v'(x))^2}}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Derive the Condition on $c$**: We equate the normal velocity to the curvature $\\kappa$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{1 + (v'(x))^2}} = \\frac{v''(x)}{(1 + (v'(x))^2)^{3/2}}\n    $$\n    Multiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{1 + (v'(x))^2}$ yields the condition that $c$ must satisfy:\n    $$\n    c = \\frac{v''(x)}{1 + (v'(x))^2}\n    $$\n    Since $v(x) = u(x)+ct$, its derivatives with respect to $x$ are the same as for $u(x)$: $v'(x)=u'(x)$ and $v''(x)=u''(x)$. So, the condition is:\n    $$\n    c = \\frac{u''(x)}{1 + (u'(x))^2}\n    $$\n    For this to be a valid translating solution with a constant $c$, the expression on the right-hand side must be constant for all $x$ in the domain.\n\n5.  **Calculate $c$ for the given function**: We are given $u(x) = -\\ln(\\cos x)$ for $x \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. We compute its first and second derivatives:\n    - First derivative:\n      $$\n      u'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (-\\ln(\\cos x)) = - \\frac{1}{\\cos x} (-\\sin x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\tan x\n      $$\n    - Second derivative:\n      $$\n      u''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (\\tan x) = \\sec^2 x\n      $$\n    Now, we substitute these derivatives into the condition for $c$:\n    $$\n    c = \\frac{\\sec^2 x}{1 + (\\tan x)^2}\n    $$\n    Using the trigonometric identity $1 + \\tan^2 x = \\sec^2 x$, we find:\n    $$\n    c = \\frac{\\sec^2 x}{\\sec^2 x} = 1\n    $$\n    The value of the expression is indeed constant and equal to $1$.

Let $X: M^n \\times [0, T) \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be the family of immersions.\n\n1.  **Translating Soliton Condition**: The solution is a translating solution, which means the hypersurface translates with a constant velocity vector $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The position vector at time $t$ is given by:\n    $$\n    X(p, t) = X_0(p) + tV\n    $$\n    where $p \\in M^n$ is a point on the abstract manifold and $X_0$ is the initial immersion.\n    The velocity of any point on the hypersurface is $\\partial_t X = V$. The MCF equation is $\\partial_t X = H\\mathbf{n}$, where $H$ is the mean curvature and $\\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal. For a translating solution, we must therefore have:\n    $$\n    V = H\\mathbf{n}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Laplace-Beltrami Operator Identity**: A fundamental identity for a hypersurface in Euclidean space relates its position vector $X$ to its mean curvature vector $H\\mathbf{n}$ via the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta_M$ on the hypersurface:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_M X = H\\mathbf{n}\n    $$\n    This identity holds for any hypersurface in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\n3.  **Combining Identities**: By combining the translating soliton condition with the Laplace-Beltrami identity, we obtain an equation on the hypersurface $M_t$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_M X = V\n    $$\n\n4.  **Application of Maximum Principle**: Let's consider the scalar function $f: M^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by the dot product of the position vector $X$ with the constant translation vector $V$:\n    $$\n    f(p) = V \\cdot X(p, t)\n    $$\n    We apply the Laplace-Beltrami operator to $f$. Since $V$ is a constant vector and $\\Delta_M$ is a linear operator which acts component-wise on vector-valued functions, we have:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_M f = \\Delta_M(V \\cdot X) = V \\cdot (\\Delta_M X)\n    $$\n    Substituting $\\Delta_M X = V$ into this equation, we get:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_M f = V \\cdot V = |V|^2\n    $$\n    The hypersurface $M_t$ is assumed to be closed, which means it is a compact manifold without boundary. The function $f$ is a smooth function on this compact manifold. The equation $\\Delta_M f = |V|^2$ indicates that $f$ is a subharmonic function, since $\\Delta_M f \\ge 0$.\n\n    By the maximum principle on compact manifolds, a smooth subharmonic function must be a constant. (This can be seen by integrating the equation over the manifold: $\\int_M \\Delta_M f \\, d\\mu = 0$ by the divergence theorem. Since the integrand $\\Delta_M f = |V|^2$ is non-negative, it must be zero everywhere. Thus $\\Delta_M f=0$.)\n\n    Since $f$ must be constant, its Laplacian must be zero: $\\Delta_M f = 0$.\n    Comparing this with our derived equation, we must have:\n    $$\n    |V|^2 = 0\n    $$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The condition $|V|^2 = 0$ implies that the vector $V$ is the zero vector, $V = \\mathbf{0}$. This means that any closed translating solution to the mean curvature flow must be a trivial solution, corresponding to a stationary hypersurface ($M_t=M_0$ for all $t$). Therefore, no nontrivial ($V \\neq \\mathbf{0}$) compact translating solutions exist for closed hypersurfaces under mean curvature flow.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the constant $c$ found in Part 1.\nBased on the derivation in Part 1, the value is $c=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3036003"}]}
