Our goal is to compute $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(S^{2}(\\mathfrak{m}^{\\ast})^{H})$.\n\nLet $\\rho: H \\to \\operatorname{GL}(\\mathfrak{m})$ be the isotropy representation, given by $\\rho(h) = \\operatorname{Ad}(h)\\!\\restriction_{\\mathfrak{m}}$ for any $h \\in H$. A symmetric bilinear form $B: \\mathfrak{m} \\times \\mathfrak{m} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ belongs to $S^{2}(\\mathfrak{m}^{\\ast})^{H}$ if and only if it is invariant under the action of $H$, which means:\n$$B(\\rho(h)X, \\rho(h)Y) = B(X, Y) \\quad \\forall h \\in H, \\forall X, Y \\in \\mathfrak{m}$$\n\nSince $G$ acts by isometries on $(M, g)$, the metric $g$ at the base point $o \\in M$ induces an inner product, let's denote it by $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$, on the tangent space $T_oM \\cong \\mathfrak{m}$. The stabilizer $H$ acts by isometries on $T_oM$, so this inner product is $\\operatorname{Ad}(H)$-invariant. That is, the representation $\\rho$ consists of orthogonal transformations with respect to this inner product:\n$$\\langle \\rho(h)X, \\rho(h)Y \\rangle = \\langle X, Y \\rangle \\quad \\forall h \\in H, \\forall X, Y \\in \\mathfrak{m}$$\nThis means $\\rho(H) \\subseteq O(\\mathfrak{m}, \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle)$.\n\nAny symmetric bilinear form $B$ on $\\mathfrak{m}$ can be uniquely represented by a self-adjoint linear operator $A: \\mathfrak{m} \\to \\mathfrak{m}$ via the relation $B(X, Y) = \\langle AX, Y \\rangle$. The operator $A$ is self-adjoint, meaning $A^* = A$, where the adjoint is taken with respect to the inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$.\n\nWe can now express the invariance condition for $B$ in terms of the operator $A$:\n$$B(\\rho(h)X, \\rho(h)Y) = \\langle A(\\rho(h)X), \\rho(h)Y \\rangle$$\nSince $\\rho(h)$ is an orthogonal operator, its adjoint is its inverse: $\\rho(h)^* = \\rho(h)^{-1}$. So, we can write:\n$$\\langle A(\\rho(h)X), \\rho(h)Y \\rangle = \\langle \\rho(h)^* A \\rho(h) X, Y \\rangle = \\langle \\rho(h)^{-1} A \\rho(h) X, Y \\rangle$$\nThe invariance condition $B(\\rho(h)X, \\rho(h)Y) = B(X, Y)$ is equivalent to $\\langle \\rho(h)^{-1} A \\rho(h) X, Y \\rangle = \\langle AX, Y \\rangle$ for all $X, Y \\in \\mathfrak{m}$. This holds if and only if:\n$$\\rho(h)^{-1} A \\rho(h) = A \\quad \\forall h \\in H$$\nMultiplying by $\\rho(h)$ on the left, we get $A \\rho(h) = \\rho(h) A$. This means the operator $A$ must commute with every operator $\\rho(h)$ in the representation. Such an operator is called an intertwining operator. The set of all linear operators on $\\mathfrak{m}$ that commute with the action of $H$ forms a real algebra known as the commutant of the representation, denoted $\\operatorname{End}_H(\\mathfrak{m})$.\n\nThus, the space $S^{2}(\\mathfrak{m}^{\\ast})^{H}$ is linearly isomorphic to the space of self-adjoint operators within the commutant $\\operatorname{End}_H(\\mathfrak{m})$. Our problem reduces to finding the dimension of this space of self-adjoint operators.\n\nThe problem states that the representation $\\rho: H \\to \\operatorname{GL}(\\mathfrak{m})$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{R}$. We now apply Schur's lemma for real representations, which asserts that if $\\rho$ is a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of a group $H$ on a real vector space $\\mathfrak{m}$, then its commutant $\\operatorname{End}_H(\\mathfrak{m})$ is a real associative division algebra.\n\nBy the Frobenius theorem, there are only three finite-dimensional associative division algebras over the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, up to isomorphism:\n1.  The real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.\n2.  The complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$.\n3.  The quaternions $\\mathbb{H}$.\n\nWe must determine the dimension of the subspace of self-adjoint elements in each of these three cases.\n\nCase 1: $\\operatorname{End}_H(\\mathfrak{m}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe elements of the commutant are scalar multiples of the identity operator, $A = c \\cdot Id$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The adjoint is $A^* = (c \\cdot Id)^* = c \\cdot Id^* = c \\cdot Id = A$. Thus, every element is self-adjoint. The space of self-adjoint operators is the entire commutant, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ and has dimension $1$.\n\nCase 2: $\\operatorname{End}_H(\\mathfrak{m}) \\cong \\mathbb{C}$.\nThe commutant algebra is generated by the identity $Id$ and an operator $J \\in \\operatorname{End}_H(\\mathfrak{m})$ such that $J^2 = -Id$. Any element can be written as $A = a \\cdot Id + b \\cdot J$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The adjoint $J^*$ must also be in the commutant $\\operatorname{End}_H(\\mathfrak{m})$. An operator in $\\operatorname{End}_H(\\mathfrak{m})$ that is not a scalar multiple of the identity cannot be self-adjoint if the representation is irreducible (otherwise its eigenspaces would be proper non-trivial invariant subspaces). Since $J^2 = -Id$, $J$ is not a scalar multiple of $Id$, so $J^* \\neq J$. A more detailed argument based on the trace shows that with respect to the $H$-invariant inner product, we can and must have $J^* = -J$. That is, $J$ is skew-adjoint.\nThe adjoint of a general element $A$ is:\n$$A^* = (a \\cdot Id + b \\cdot J)^* = a \\cdot Id^* + b \\cdot J^* = a \\cdot Id - b \\cdot J$$\nFor $A$ to be self-adjoint, we need $A = A^*$, which implies:\n$$a \\cdot Id + b \\cdot J = a \\cdot Id - b \\cdot J \\implies 2b \\cdot J = 0$$\nSince $J \\neq 0$, we must have $b=0$. The self-adjoint operators are precisely the elements of the form $A = a \\cdot Id$. This is a $1$-dimensional real vector space.\n\nCase 3: $\\operatorname{End}_H(\\mathfrak{m}) \\cong \\mathbb{H}$.\nThe commutant is isomorphic to the algebra of quaternions. It is generated by $Id$ and three operators $J_1, J_2, J_3 \\in \\operatorname{End}_H(\\mathfrak{m})$ satisfying the quaternion relations: $J_1^2 = J_2^2 = J_3^2 = -Id$ and $J_1 J_2 = -J_2 J_1 = J_3$, etc. Any element can be written as $A = a \\cdot Id + b \\cdot J_1 + c \\cdot J_2 + d \\cdot J_3$ for $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nAs in the complex case, since the representation is irreducible, none of $J_1, J_2, J_3$ can be self-adjoint. With respect to the $H$-invariant inner product, they are skew-adjoint: $J_k^* = -J_k$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The adjoint of a general element $A$ is:\n$$A^* = (a \\cdot Id + b \\cdot J_1 + c \\cdot J_2 + d \\cdot J_3)^* = a \\cdot Id - b \\cdot J_1 - c \\cdot J_2 - d \\cdot J_3$$\nFor $A$ to be self-adjoint, $A=A^*$, which implies:\n$$2(b \\cdot J_1 + c \\cdot J_2 + d \\cdot J_3) = 0$$\nSince $J_1, J_2, J_3$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$, we must have $b=c=d=0$. The self-adjoint operators are again precisely the elements of the form $A = a \\cdot Id$. This is a $1$-dimensional real vector space.\n\nIn all three possible cases allowed by Schur's lemma for a real irreducible representation, the space of self-adjoint operators in the commutant is the $1$-dimensional space of real scalar multiples of the identity operator.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the space $S^{2}(\\mathfrak{m}^{\\ast})^{H}$ of $\\operatorname{Ad}(H)$-invariant symmetric bilinear forms on $\\mathfrak{m}$ is $1$.

We will do this by computing a specific quantity, $S = \\langle \\alpha_{X}X, e_{3}\\rangle$, and showing it is non-zero.\n\nFirst, let's establish the theoretical framework. The space $(SU(2), g)$ is a homogeneous Riemannian manifold, modeled as $G/K$ where $G=SU(2)$ and the isotropy subgroup $K$ is the trivial group $\\{e\\}$. The tangent space at the identity $e$ is identified with the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{su}(2)$.

For a Lie group $G$ itself, we have $\\mathfrak{k}=\\{0\\}$ and $\\mathfrak{m}=\\mathfrak{g}$. The Nomizu map $\\alpha_U V$ for $U, V \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ is identified with the value of the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla_U V$ at the identity, where $U$ and $V$ are considered as left-invariant vector fields.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ for a left-invariant metric on a Lie group is given at the identity by the formula, derived from the Koszul formula, for any $U,V,W \\in \\mathfrak{g}$:\n$$\n2\\langle \\nabla_U V, W \\rangle = \\langle [U, V], W \\rangle - \\langle [U, W], V \\rangle - \\langle [V, W], U \\rangle\n$$\nHere, we identify $\\alpha_U V$ with $\\nabla_U V$.\n\nA homogeneous Riemannian manifold is a geodesic orbit (g.o.) manifold if and only if for every tangent vector $Y$ at a point, the geodesic starting in the direction of $Y$ is an orbit of a one-parameter subgroup of isometries. For a homogeneous space $G/K$ like ours, this condition is equivalent to the algebraic condition that for every $Y \\in \\mathfrak{g}$, the vector $\\alpha_Y Y$ must be parallel to $Y$. That is, $\\alpha_Y Y = \\lambda Y$ for some scalar $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo verify the failure of the g.o. condition, we need to find a single vector $X \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ for which $\\alpha_X X$ is not parallel to $X$. The problem proposes we use $X=e_1+e_2$.\nA simple way to check if two vectors are not parallel is to show that one has a non-zero projection onto a direction orthogonal to the other. Let's check if the vector $e_3$ is orthogonal to $X$:\n$$\n\\langle X, e_3 \\rangle = \\langle e_1+e_2, e_3 \\rangle = \\langle e_1, e_3 \\rangle + \\langle e_2, e_3 \\rangle\n$$\nSince the basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ is given as orthogonal, we have $\\langle e_1, e_3 \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle e_2, e_3 \\rangle = 0$. Thus, $\\langle X, e_3 \\rangle = 0$, meaning $e_3$ is orthogonal to $X$.\n\nIf $\\alpha_X X$ were parallel to $X$, it would be of the form $\\alpha_X X = \\lambda X$ for some $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In this case, its inner product with $e_3$ would be:\n$$\n\\langle \\alpha_X X, e_3 \\rangle = \\langle \\lambda X, e_3 \\rangle = \\lambda \\langle X, e_3 \\rangle = \\lambda \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nTherefore, if we compute $S = \\langle \\alpha_X X, e_3 \\rangle$ and find it to be non-zero, we will have proven that $\\alpha_X X$ is not parallel to $X$, and consequently, that $(SU(2), g)$ is not a g.o. manifold.\n\nWe now compute $S = \\langle \\alpha_X X, e_3 \\rangle$.

We are given $\\langle e_1, e_1 \\rangle = a$ and $\\langle e_2, e_2 \\rangle = b$.\n$$\n\\langle e_1-e_2, e_1+e_2 \\rangle = a + 0 - 0 - b = a-b\n$$\nThus, $\\langle [X, e_3], X \\rangle = 2(a-b)$.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the equation for $2S$:\n$$\n2S = 0 - 2\\langle [X, e_3], X \\rangle = -2(2(a-b)) = -4(a-b)\n$$\nSolving for $S$, we get:\n$$\nS = -2(a-b) = 2(b-a)\n$$\nThe problem states that $a$ and $b$ are distinct, i.e., $a \\neq b$. Therefore, $b-a \\neq 0$, which implies $S \\neq 0$.\n\nThe non-vanishing of $S = \\langle \\alpha_X X, e_3 \\rangle$ certifies the failure of the g.o. condition. The vector $\\alpha_X X$ has a non-zero component in the direction of $e_3$, which is orthogonal to $X$. This means $\\alpha_X X$ is not parallel to $X$.

For a rank-one symmetric space like $\\mathbb{C}P^n$, these representations are inequivalent and each appears with multiplicity one.\n\nThe Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ is a $G$-invariant differential operator. By Schur's Lemma, it must act as a scalar on each irreducible subspace $V_k$. Let $\\Omega$ be the quadratic Casimir element of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{su}(n+1)$. The Laplacian $\\Delta$ is proportional to the operator induced by $\\Omega$. We write this relationship as $\\Delta = C \\cdot \\Omega$, where $C$ is a constant determined by the normalization of the metric on $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ and the Killing form on $\\mathfrak{g}$.

Our first task is to identify the spherical representations $V_k$ and compute their Casimir eigenvalues $c_k$.\n\nThe space of smooth functions on $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ can be identified with the $U(1)$-invariant functions on the sphere $S^{2n+1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. The spherical harmonics on $S^{2n+1}$ are restrictions of harmonic polynomials on $\\mathbb{C}^{n+1} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2n+2}$.

For the function to be $U(1)$-invariant, we require $p=q$.

For the standard normalization of the inner product for the root system $A_n$, the inner products of fundamental weights are $\\langle \\Lambda_i, \\Lambda_j \\rangle = \\frac{i(n+1-j)}{n+1}$ for $i \\le j$.\nOur highest weight is $\\Lambda_k = k(\\Lambda_1 + \\Lambda_n)$.\n$$c_k = \\langle k(\\Lambda_1+\\Lambda_n), k(\\Lambda_1+\\Lambda_n) + 2\\sum_{j=1}^n \\Lambda_j \\rangle$$\n$$c_k = k^2 \\langle \\Lambda_1+\\Lambda_n, \\Lambda_1+\\Lambda_n \\rangle + 2k \\langle \\Lambda_1+\\Lambda_n, \\sum_{j=1}^n \\Lambda_j \\rangle$$\nWe compute the inner products:\n$\\langle \\Lambda_1, \\Lambda_1 \\rangle = \\frac{n}{n+1}$, $\\langle \\Lambda_n, \\Lambda_n \\rangle = \\frac{n}{n+1}$, $\\langle \\Lambda_1, \\Lambda_n \\rangle = \\frac{1}{n+1}$.\n$\\langle \\Lambda_1+\\Lambda_n, \\Lambda_1+\\Lambda_n \\rangle = \\frac{n}{n+1} + \\frac{n}{n+1} + 2\\frac{1}{n+1} = \\frac{2n+2}{n+1} = 2$.\n$\\langle \\Lambda_1, \\sum_{j=1}^n \\Lambda_j \\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{1(n+1-j)}{n+1} = \\frac{1}{n+1} \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\frac{n}{2}$.\n$\\langle \\Lambda_n, \\sum_{j=1}^n \\Lambda_j \\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{j(n+1-n)}{n+1} = \\frac{1}{n+1} \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\frac{n}{2}$.\n$\\langle \\Lambda_1+\\Lambda_n, \\sum_{j=1}^n \\Lambda_j \\rangle = \\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} = n$.\nSubstituting these values back:\n$$c_k = k^2(2) + 2k(n) = 2k(k+n)$$\n\n**3. Normalization Constant**\n\nWe fix the constant $C$ by examining the case $n=1$. The manifold is $\\mathbb{C}P^1 = \\mathrm{SU}(2)/\\mathrm{S}(\\mathrm{U}(1)\\mathrm{U}(1)) \\cong \\mathrm{SU}(2)/\\mathrm{U}(1)$, which is isometric to the $2$-sphere $S^2$. The normalization of the Fubini-Study metric to have holomorphic sectional curvature $1$ makes $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ isometric to the round $2$-sphere of radius $R=1$. The eigenvalues of the Laplacian on the unit $2$-sphere are famously given by $\\lambda'_l = l(l+1)$ for $l \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$, with multiplicity $2l+1$.\n\nFor $n=1$, our index $k$ corresponds to the representations $\\mathcal{H}_{k,k}(\\mathbb{C}^2)$. The dimension of this space is $m_k = \\dim \\mathcal{H}_{k,k}(\\mathbb{C}^2) = (k+1)^2 - k^2 = 2k+1$. This matches the multiplicity on $S^2$ if we identify our index $k$ with the spherical harmonic degree $l$, i.e., $l=k$. Therefore, the eigenvalues on $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ must be $\\lambda_k = k(k+1)$.\n\nOur derived Casimir eigenvalue for $n=1$ is $c_k = 2k(1+k)$. The relation $\\lambda_k=C \\cdot c_k$ becomes:\n$$k(k+1) = C \\cdot 2k(k+1)$$\nFor $k0$, this implies $C = 1/2$. Assuming this normalization constant is independent of $n$, the general formula for the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ is:\n$$\\lambda_k = C \\cdot c_k = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2k(k+n) = k(k+n)$$\n\n**4. Multiplicity of Eigenvalues**\n\nThe multiplicity $m_k$ of the eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$ is the dimension of the corresponding representation space $V_k = \\mathcal{H}_{k,k}(\\mathbb{C}^{n+1})$. The dimension can be computed from the exact sequence relating spaces of polynomials $\\mathcal{P}$ and harmonic polynomials $\\mathcal{H}$:\n$$\\dim \\mathcal{H}_{p,q}(\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}) = \\dim \\mathcal{P}_{p,q}(\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}) - \\dim \\mathcal{P}_{p-1,q-1}(\\mathbb{C}^{n+1})$$\nThe dimension of the space of polynomials of bidegree $(p,q)$ on $\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ is the product of the dimensions of the spaces of homogeneous polynomials of degrees $p$ and $q$:\n$$\\dim \\mathcal{P}_{p,q}(\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}) = \\binom{p+n}{n} \\binom{q+n}{n}$$\nFor $p=q=k$, the multiplicity is:\n$$m_k = \\dim \\mathcal{H}_{k,k}(\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}) = \\binom{k+n}{n}^2 - \\binom{k-1+n}{n}^2$$\nFor $k=0$, this gives $m_0 = \\binom{n}{n}^2 - \\binom{n-1}{n}^2 = 1^2 - 0 = 1$, corresponding to the constant functions. For $k \\ge 1$, we can simplify the expression by factoring the difference of squares:\n$$m_k = \\left( \\binom{k+n}{n} - \\binom{k+n-1}{n} \\right) \\left( \\binom{k+n}{n} + \\binom{k+n-1}{n} \\right)$$\nUsing the identity $\\binom{N}{K} - \\binom{N-1}{K} = \\binom{N-1}{K-1}$, the first factor is:\n$$\\binom{k+n}{n} - \\binom{k+n-1}{n} = \\binom{k+n-1}{n-1}$$\nThe second factor can be simplified as:\n$$\\binom{k+n}{n} + \\binom{k+n-1}{n} = \\frac{(k+n)!}{n!k!} + \\frac{(k+n-1)!}{n!(k-1)!} = \\frac{(k+n-1)!(k+n+k)}{n!k!} = \\frac{2k+n}{n} \\frac{(k+n-1)!}{(n-1)!k!} = \\frac{2k+n}{n}\\binom{k+n-1}{k}$$\nCombining these and using the identity $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$, we have $\\binom{k+n-1}{k} = \\binom{k+n-1}{n-1}$.\n$$m_k = \\binom{k+n-1}{n-1} \\cdot \\frac{2k+n}{n} \\binom{k+n-1}{n-1} = \\frac{2k+n}{n} \\left(\\binom{k+n-1}{n-1}\\right)^2$$\nThis formula is also valid for $k=0$, as it gives $m_0 = \\frac{n}{n} \\binom{n-1}{n-1}^2 = 1$.\n\nThe complete spectrum of the Laplacian on $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ is given by the eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$ and its multiplicity $m_k$.\n\nEigenvalue: $\\lambda_k = k(k+n)$\nMultiplicity: $m_k = \\frac{2k+n}{n} \\binom{k+n-1}{n-1}^2$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nk(k+n)  \\frac{2k+n}{n} \\binom{k+n-1}{n-1}^{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2979659"}]}
