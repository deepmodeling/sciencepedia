If $M$ is of noncompact type, then the sectional curvature is nonpositive, which prevents geodesics from closing; therefore the isotropy subgroup $K$ must be compact.", "solution": "We analyze from first principles and well-established facts in Riemannian geometry and Lie theory.\n\nFirst, recall the setting and key definitions. A Riemannian symmetric space $M$ is a connected Riemannian manifold such that for each $p \\in M$, there is an isometry $s_p$ with $p$ as an isolated fixed point and $ds_p|_p = -\\mathrm{id}$. When $M$ is presented as $M = G/K$, $G$ is a connected Lie group of isometries acting transitively and effectively, and $K$ is the stabilizer (isotropy subgroup) at a base point $o$. For $M$ of noncompact type, $M$ is simply connected, nonpositively curved, and has no flat factor; in particular, $M$ is complete. For $G$ a connected linear semisimple Lie group, $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a semisimple Lie algebra and $G$ admits a Cartan involution.\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\nOption A:\n- Foundational fact: The full isometry group $\\mathrm{Isom}(M)$ of a complete Riemannian manifold acts properly on $M$; this is a standard theorem derivable from equicontinuity and completeness (one route is via the Myers-Steenrod theorem and Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, ensuring sequences of isometries with bounded displacement have convergent subsequences, which yields properness).\n- For a proper action of a topological group $H$ on a Hausdorff space $X$, the stabilizer $H_x$ of any point $x \\in X$ is compact. To see this: consider the map $\\Phi \\colon H \\times X \\to X \\times X$ given by $\\Phi(h,x) = (hx,x)$; properness means $\\Phi$ is a proper map. The stabilizer $H_x = \\{h \\in H : hx = x\\}$ is homeomorphic to $\\Phi^{-1}(\\{(x,x)\\})$ intersected with $H \\times \\{x\\}$, hence is compact as a fiber of a proper map over a point.\n- In our setting, $M$ of noncompact type is complete, so the action of $\\mathrm{Isom}(M)$ is proper. Since $G$ is a closed subgroup of $\\mathrm{Isom}(M)$ acting by isometries, the stabilizer $K$ of $o$ in $G$ is a closed subgroup of the compact stabilizer in $\\mathrm{Isom}(M)$, hence compact. Therefore, the reasoning in A correctly justifies compactness of $K$ for $M$ of noncompact type.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nOption B:\n- Foundational facts from semisimple Lie theory: For a connected linear semisimple Lie group $G$, there exists a Cartan involution $\\theta \\colon G \\to G$, an involutive automorphism whose differential at the identity, still denoted $\\theta$, is an involution of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ giving the Cartan decomposition $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{k} \\oplus \\mathfrak{p}$ with $\\mathfrak{k} = \\{X \\in \\mathfrak{g} : \\theta X = X\\}$ and $\\mathfrak{p} = \\{X \\in \\mathfrak{g} : \\theta X = -X\\}$. Let $K = G^\\theta$ be the fixed-point subgroup of $\\theta$.\n- The Killing form $B$ on $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nondegenerate and invariant. Define $B_\\theta(X,Y) := -B(X,\\theta Y)$. For semisimple $G$ and Cartan involution $\\theta$, $B_\\theta$ is a positive-definite inner product on $\\mathfrak{g}$. Moreover, for $k \\in K$, we have $\\theta \\circ \\operatorname{Ad}(k) = \\operatorname{Ad}(k) \\circ \\theta$, and the $B$-invariance yields\n  $$B_\\theta(\\operatorname{Ad}(k)X,\\operatorname{Ad}(k)Y) = -B(\\operatorname{Ad}(k)X, \\theta \\operatorname{Ad}(k)Y) = -B(X, \\operatorname{Ad}(k)^{-1} \\theta \\operatorname{Ad}(k)Y) = -B(X, \\theta Y) = B_\\theta(X,Y),$$\n  so $\\operatorname{Ad}(K) \\subset O(\\mathfrak{g},B_\\theta)$, a compact Lie group.\n- The adjoint representation $\\operatorname{Ad} \\colon G \\to \\operatorname{GL}(\\mathfrak{g})$ has kernel equal to the center $Z(G)$ of $G$. For connected semisimple $G$, $Z(G)$ is finite. Hence the restriction $\\operatorname{Ad} \\colon K \\to O(\\mathfrak{g},B_\\theta)$ has finite kernel. The image $\\operatorname{Ad}(K)$ is a closed subgroup of a compact group, hence compact. A Lie group homomorphism with finite kernel is a finite covering map onto its image; therefore, $K$ is a finite covering of the compact Lie group $\\operatorname{Ad}(K)$, and a finite covering of a compact space is compact. Thus $K$ is compact.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nOption C:\n- The assertion that every closed subgroup of a Lie group is compact is false. A standard counterexample is the additive group $\\mathbb{R}$, which is a closed subgroup of the Lie group $\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$ (via diagonal embeddings or translations), but is not compact. Being closed in a Lie group does not imply compactness; compactness requires additional structure (e.g., inclusion in a compact ambient group).\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D:\n- The exponential map $\\exp \\colon \\mathfrak{k} \\to K$ is a local diffeomorphism near the identity but is not globally a diffeomorphism in general. Many compact Lie groups are not diffeomorphic to their Lie algebra; they may have nontrivial topology (e.g., fundamental group, higher homotopy) incompatible with a vector space. Surjectivity of $\\exp$ can fail globally for arbitrary compact Lie groups, and even when surjective (as happens for compact, connected, semisimple groups), it is not injective. Therefore, the claimed diffeomorphism is false, and the argument does not justify compactness.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption E:\n- Nonpositive sectional curvature in a symmetric space of noncompact type does not directly imply statements about closure of geodesics determining the compactness of isotropy. The existence or nonexistence of closed geodesics is unrelated to whether the isotropy subgroup $K$ is compact. Compactness of $K$ must be established via group action properties (e.g., properness of the isometry action) or via structural Lie-theoretic arguments (e.g., Cartan involution and the adjoint representation), not via curvature preventing geodesic closure. Hence this reasoning is invalid.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nIn summary, the valid justifications are those in A and B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2991892"}, {"introduction": "While noncompact symmetric spaces are topologically simple—they are all diffeomorphic to Euclidean space—their compact duals exhibit a rich and varied topological structure.

The metric at $p$ is given by $(L_g)_* B$.\n\nLet $a = \\exp(H)$ for $H \\in \\mathfrak{a}^{+}$. The tangent space at $p_H = a \\cdot o$ is spanned by vectors arising from infinitesimal variations of the coordinates $(k,H)$ around $(e,H)$.\n1.  Variation in $H$: Let $H' \\in \\mathfrak{a}$. The curve $t \\mapsto \\exp(H+tH') \\cdot o$ has tangent vector at $t=0$ given by $(L_a)_* H'$. These vectors form a subspace $(L_a)_* \\mathfrak{a} \\subset T_{p_H} M$.\n2.  Variation in $k$: Let $X \\in \\mathfrak{k}$. The curve $t \\mapsto \\exp(tX) a \\cdot o$ has tangent vector at $t=0$ given by the fundamental vector field $X_M$ at $p_H$. This vector is $(d\\pi)_a(Xa)$, where $\\pi:G \\to G/K$ is the projection. To analyze this vector in our framework, we push it back to $T_o M \\cong \\mathfrak{p}$ via $(L_{a^{-1}})_*$:\n$$ (L_{a^{-1}})_* (X_M(p_H)) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} a^{-1} \\exp(tX) a \\cdot o = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\exp(t \\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X) \\cdot o $$\nThe corresponding element in $\\mathfrak{p}$ is the $\\mathfrak{p}$-part of $\\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X$, which we denote by $(\\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X)_\\mathfrak{p}$. Thus, the tangent vectors arising from infinitesimal variations in $k$ are of the form $(L_a)_* ((\\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X)_\\mathfrak{p})$ for $X \\in \\mathfrak{k}$.\n\nThese two families of tangent vectors are orthogonal. For $H' \\in \\mathfrak{a}$ and $X \\in \\mathfrak{k}$:\n$$ g_{p_H}((L_a)_* H', (L_a)_* ((\\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X)_\\mathfrak{p})) = B(H', (\\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X)_\\mathfrak{p}) $$\nSince $H' \\in \\mathfrak{p}$ and $\\mathfrak{k}$ and $\\mathfrak{p}$ are orthogonal under $B$, this is equal to $B(H', \\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X)$. The Killing form is Ad-invariant, but $a \\notin K$. We use the property $B(\\mathrm{Ad}(g)U, V) = B(U, \\mathrm{Ad}(g^{-1})V)$.\n$$ B(H', \\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X) = B(\\mathrm{Ad}(a)H', X) $$\nSince $H, H' \\in \\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathfrak{a}$ is abelian, $\\mathrm{Ad}(a)H' = \\mathrm{Ad}(\\exp H)H' = e^{\\mathrm{ad} H}H' = H'$. Thus, the inner product is $B(H', X)=0$ as $H' \\in \\mathfrak{p}, X \\in \\mathfrak{k}$.\n\nThe tangent space $T_{p_H} M$ thus decomposes into an orthogonal direct sum $(L_a)_* \\mathfrak{a} \\oplus (L_a)_* \\mathcal{V}_H$, where $\\mathcal{V}_H = (\\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})\\mathfrak{k})_\\mathfrak{p}$. The Jacobian $J(H)$ is the volume distortion factor for the map from $\\mathfrak{k} \\times \\mathfrak{a}$ to $T_{p_H} M$. The space $\\mathfrak{a}$ is mapped isometrically to $(L_a)_*\\mathfrak{a}$. The Jacobian is therefore determined by the volume distortion of the linear map $T_H: \\mathfrak{k} \\to \\mathfrak{p}$ defined by $X \\mapsto (\\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X)_\\mathfrak{p}$.\n\nThe centralizer $M = Z_K(A)$ of $A$ in $K$ has Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{m} = \\{X \\in \\mathfrak{k} : [X,H]=0 \\text{ for all } H \\in \\mathfrak{a}\\}$. For $X \\in \\mathfrak{m}$, $\\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X = X$, and since $X \\in \\mathfrak{k}$, its $\\mathfrak{p}$-part is $0$. Thus, $T_H$ vanishes on $\\mathfrak{m}$, which corresponds to the fact that the map $\\Psi$ factors through $K/M$. We need to compute the determinant of $T_H$ acting on a complement to $\\mathfrak{m}$ in $\\mathfrak{k}$.\n\nWe use the restricted root space decomposition $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{g}_0 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{\\alpha \\in \\Sigma} \\mathfrak{g}_\\alpha$, where $\\mathfrak{g}_0 = \\mathfrak{m} \\oplus \\mathfrak{a}$. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{k}$ decomposes as $\\mathfrak{k} = \\mathfrak{m} \\oplus \\bigoplus_{\\alpha \\in \\Sigma^+} \\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha$, where $\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha = \\mathfrak{k} \\cap (\\mathfrak{g}_\\alpha \\oplus \\mathfrak{g}_{-\\alpha})$. The map $T_H$ preserves this decomposition in the sense that $T_H(\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha) \\subset \\mathfrak{p}_\\alpha = \\mathfrak{p} \\cap (\\mathfrak{g}_\\alpha \\oplus \\mathfrak{g}_{-\\alpha})$. The dimension of $\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_\\alpha$ is the root multiplicity $m_\\alpha$. The overall determinant is the product of determinants of the restrictions $T_H|_{\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha}$.\n\nLet $X \\in \\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha$. $a=\\exp H$.\n$T_H(X) = (\\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X)_\\mathfrak{p} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X - \\theta(\\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1})X))$.\nUsing $\\theta(a^{-1})=a$ and $\\theta(X)=X$, this simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathrm{Ad}(a^{-1}) - \\mathrm{Ad}(a))X = -\\sinh(\\mathrm{ad} H)X$.\nOn the space $\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha$, the operator $(\\mathrm{ad} H)^2$ acts as multiplication by $-\\alpha(H)^2$.\nSo, $(T_H)|_{\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha} = -\\sinh(\\mathrm{ad} H)|_{\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha} = -(\\mathrm{ad} H)|_{\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\mathrm{ad} H)^{2k}}{(2k+1)!} = -\\frac{\\sinh(\\alpha(H))}{\\alpha(H)} (\\mathrm{ad} H)|_{\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha}$.\nThe map $\\mathrm{ad} H: \\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha \\to \\mathfrak{p}_\\alpha$ is an isomorphism for $H \\in \\mathfrak{a}^+$. Its determinant can be computed. Let $\\{X_j\\}_{j=1}^{m_\\alpha}$ be an orthonormal basis for $\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha$. Then $B([H,X_i],[H,X_j]) = -B(X_i, [H,[H,X_j]]) = -B(X_i, -\\alpha(H)^2 X_j) = \\alpha(H)^2 \\delta_{ij}$. Thus, $\\{ \\frac{1}{\\alpha(H)}[H,X_j] \\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $\\mathfrak{p}_\\alpha$. With respect to these bases, the matrix of $\\mathrm{ad} H$ is diagonal with entries $\\alpha(H)$.\nHence, $\\det((\\mathrm{ad} H)|_{\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha}) = (\\alpha(H))^{m_\\alpha}$.\nThe determinant of $T_H$ restricted to $\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha$ is:\n$$ \\det((T_H)|_{\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha}) = \\left(-\\frac{\\sinh(\\alpha(H))}{\\alpha(H)}\\right)^{m_\\alpha} \\det((\\mathrm{ad} H)|_{\\mathfrak{k}_\\alpha}) = \\left(-\\frac{\\sinh(\\alpha(H))}{\\alpha(H)}\\right)^{m_\\alpha} (\\alpha(H))^{m_\\alpha} = (-\\sinh(\\alpha(H)))^{m_\\alpha} $$\nThe Jacobian $J(H)$ is the product of the absolute values of these determinants over all $\\alpha \\in \\Sigma^+$:\n$$ J(H) = \\prod_{\\alpha \\in \\Sigma^+} |(-\\sinh(\\alpha(H)))^{m_\\alpha}| = \\prod_{\\alpha \\in \\Sigma^+} (\\sinh \\alpha(H))^{m_\\alpha} $$\nsince for $H \\in \\mathfrak{a}^+$, we have $\\alpha(H)>0$ for all $\\alpha \\in \\Sigma^+$.\n\nNow, we specialize to $G/K = \\mathrm{SL}(3,\\mathbb{R})/\\mathrm{SO}(3)$.\nThe Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{sl}(3,\\mathbb{R})$, the space of $3 \\times 3$ real matrices with trace $0$.\nThe Cartan involution is $\\theta(X)=-X^T$.\n$\\mathfrak{k} = \\{X \\in \\mathfrak{g} | \\theta(X)=X\\} = \\{X | -X^T=X \\}$, the skew-symmetric matrices, which is $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$.\n$\\mathfrak{p} = \\{X \\in \\mathfrak{g} | \\theta(X)=-X\\} = \\{X | X^T=X \\}$, the symmetric trace-zero matrices.\nA maximal abelian subspace of $\\mathfrak{p}$ is given by the diagonal matrices:\n$\\mathfrak{a} = \\{ \\mathrm{diag}(h_1, h_2, h_3) \\mid h_1+h_2+h_3=0 \\}$. Let $H = \\mathrm{diag}(h_1, h_2, h_3)$.\nThe restricted roots $\\alpha \\in \\mathfrak{a}^*$ are the eigenvalues of the action $\\mathrm{ad}(H)$ on $\\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{g}_0$.\nLet $E_{ij}$ be the matrix unit with a $1$ in the $(i,j)$ position and zeros elsewhere. For $i \\neq j$, $E_{ij}$ is an eigenvector for $\\mathrm{ad}(H)$:\n$$ [H, E_{ij}] = H E_{ij} - E_{ij} H = h_i E_{ij} - h_j E_{ij} = (h_i-h_j) E_{ij} $$\nThe restricted roots are $\\alpha_{ij}(H) = h_i - h_j$ for $i \\neq j$. The root space $\\mathfrak{g}_{\\alpha_{ij}}$ is the one-dimensional space spanned by $E_{ij}$. Thus, all root multiplicities $m_{\\alpha}$ are $1$.\nThe set of all roots is $\\Sigma = \\{L_i-L_j \\mid i \\neq j, i,j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}\\}$, where $L_i(H)=h_i$.\n\nThe problem specifies the positive Weyl chamber $\\mathfrak{a}^+$ by the inequalities $h_1 \\geq h_2 \\geq h_3$. A choice of positive roots $\\Sigma^+$ consistent with this chamber is the set of roots $\\alpha$ for which $\\alpha(H) \\geq 0$ for all $H \\in \\mathfrak{a}^+$.\nThese are:\n$\\alpha_1(H) = h_1 - h_2 \\ge 0$\n$\\alpha_2(H) = h_2 - h_3 \\ge 0$\n$\\alpha_3(H) = h_1 - h_3 = (h_1-h_2)+(h_2-h_3) \\ge 0$\nSo, $\\Sigma^+ = \\{L_1-L_2, L_2-L_3, L_1-L_3\\}$.\n\nWe can now substitute these roots and their multiplicities ($m_\\alpha=1$ for all $\\alpha$) into the general formula for the Jacobian $J(H)$:\n$$ J(H) = \\prod_{\\alpha \\in \\Sigma^+} (\\sinh \\alpha(H))^{m_\\alpha} = \\sinh(h_1-h_2) \\cdot \\sinh(h_2-h_3) \\cdot \\sinh(h_1-h_3) $$\nThis is the explicit closed-form expression for the Jacobian in terms of $h_1, h_2, h_3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sinh(h_{1}-h_{2}) \\sinh(h_{2}-h_{3}) \\sinh(h_{1}-h_{3})}$$", "id": "2991901"}]}
