The term $X(\\psi)$ denotes the directional derivative of the components of $\\psi$ in a trivialization of the spinor bundle. Since the spinor bundle over $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is trivial, we can identify $\\psi$ with a function from $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to a fixed vector space (the spinor space), and $X(\\psi)$ is the standard directional derivative of this vector-valued function.\n\nLet us specialize this formula to $X = e_{i}$. The connection coefficients (or Christoffel symbols) of $\\nabla^{\\text{LC}}$ in the frame $\\{e_{j}\\}$ are defined by $\\nabla_{e_{i}}^{\\text{LC}} e_{j} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\Gamma_{ij}^{k} e_{k}$.

That is, $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k} = 0$ for all $i, j, k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.

The action of $e_{i}$ is simply the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate $x_{i}$:\n$$\ne_{i}(\\psi) = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x_{i}}\n$$\nThus, the spinor covariant derivative simplifies to the ordinary partial derivative:\n$$\n\\nabla_{e_{i}}\\psi = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x_{i}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this simplified expression back into the original definition of the Dirac operator:\n$$\nD\\psi = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c(e_{i}) \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x_{i}}\\right)\n$$\nThe final step is to use the provided identification of the Clifford multiplication endomorphisms $c(e_{i})$ with a fixed representation by constant matrices $\\gamma_{i}$.

We are given the tautological exact sequence of complex vector bundles over $M$:\n$$0 \\to S \\to \\underline{\\mathbb{C}}^3 \\to Q \\to 0$$\nwhere $S = \\mathcal{O}(-1)$ is the tautological line bundle, $\\underline{\\mathbb{C}}^3$ is the trivial rank-$3$ complex vector bundle, and $Q$ is the universal quotient bundle of rank $2$.\n\nThe Whitney sum formula for Chern classes states that for a short exact sequence of vector bundles $0 \\to E' \\to E \\to E'' \\to 0$, the total Chern class satisfies $c(E) = c(E')c(E'')$. Applying this to our sequence:\n$$c(\\underline{\\mathbb{C}}^3) = c(S) c(Q)$$\nThe total Chern class of a trivial bundle is $1$. Therefore, $c(\\underline{\\mathbb{C}}^3) = 1$. This implies:\n$$c(Q) = c(S)^{-1}$$\nThe bundle $S$ is the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(-1)$. Its dual is $S^{*} = \\mathcal{O}(1)$. The problem states that the first Chern class of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ generates $H^2(M; \\mathbb{Z})$, and we denote it by $H = c_1(\\mathcal{O}(1))$. The first Chern class of the dual bundle is the negative of the original bundle's first Chern class:\n$$c_1(S) = c_1(\\mathcal{O}(-1)) = -c_1(\\mathcal{O}(1)) = -H$$\nSince $S$ is a line bundle (rank $1$), its total Chern class is $c(S) = 1 + c_1(S) = 1 - H$.\n\nThe cohomology ring of $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is $H^{*}(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[H]/\\langle H^{3} \\rangle$.

The Stiefel-Whitney classes of $TM$ are related to the Chern classes of $T^{1,0}M$.

The existence of a spinor bundle is equivalent to the existence of a spin structure. Since $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is not a spin manifold, it does not possess a spinor bundle. Consequently, the untwisted Dirac operator does not exist on $\\mathbb{C}P^2$.\n- **Harmonic Spinors and the Lichnerowicz Formula**: Harmonic spinors are sections $\\psi$ of the spinor bundle that lie in the kernel of the Dirac operator, $D\\psi = 0$. The Lichnerowicz formula for a spin manifold is $D^2 = \\nabla^{*}\\nabla + \\frac{1}{4}\\mathrm{Scal}$, where $\\nabla$ is the connection on the spinor bundle and $\\mathrm{Scal}$ is the scalar curvature. On a compact spin manifold endowed with a metric of positive scalar curvature ($\\mathrm{Scal} > 0$), this formula implies that the only harmonic spinor is the zero spinor. $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ with its standard Fubini-Study metric has positive scalar curvature. However, the Lichnerowicz vanishing theorem is not applicable, as the prerequisite of being a spin manifold is not met. The reason for the absence of non-trivial harmonic spinors on $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is more fundamental: the space of spinors itself is not defined, so the space of harmonic spinors is trivially the zero vector space.\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nWe need to compute the value of $\\langle w_2(TM),[\\mathbb{C}P^1]\\rangle \\in \\{0,1\\}$. This is the evaluation of the cohomology class $w_2(TM) \\in H^2(M; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ on the homology class represented by $[\\mathbb{C}P^1]$. Since $w_2(TM)$ is a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-class, the evaluation takes values in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. We shall evaluate it on the homology class $[\\mathbb{C}P^1]_2 \\in H_2(M; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ corresponding to $[\\mathbb{C}P^1] \\in H_2(M; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe evaluation pairing is compatible with coefficient homomorphisms. This means we can use the given integer pairing and reduce the result modulo $2$:\n$$\\langle w_2(TM),[\\mathbb{C}P^1]_2 \\rangle = \\langle \\bar{H}, [\\mathbb{C}P^1]_2 \\rangle = (\\langle H, [\\mathbb{C}P^1] \\rangle) \\pmod{2}$$\nThe problem states that $\\langle H,[\\mathbb{C}P^1]\\rangle=1$.\nTherefore:\n$$\\langle w_2(TM),[\\mathbb{C}P^1]\\rangle = 1 \\pmod{2} = 1$$\nThe value of the pairing is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2995193"}, {"introduction": "A central theme in modern geometry is understanding how geometric quantities change when the metric is conformally scaled.
