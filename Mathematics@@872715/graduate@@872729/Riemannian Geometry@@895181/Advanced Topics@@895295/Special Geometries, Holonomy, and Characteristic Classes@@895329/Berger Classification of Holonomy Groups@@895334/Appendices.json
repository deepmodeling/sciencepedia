Let $(M,g)$ represent either the $n$-sphere $(S^n, g_{S^n})$ with constant positive sectional curvature or the $n$-dimensional real hyperbolic space $(\\mathbb{H}^n, g_{\\mathbb{H}^n})$ with constant negative sectional curvature. In both cases, $M$ is an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant, non-zero sectional curvature $\\kappa$, and for $n \\geq 2$, it is simply-connected and oriented.\n\nOur goal is to determine the Lie group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}(M)$ for an arbitrary point $p \\in M$. The strategy is to first determine its Lie algebra, $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M)$, and then deduce the structure of the group itself.\n\nAccording to the Ambrose–Singer theorem, a provided fact, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M)$ is generated by the set of curvature endomorphisms. As $S^n$ and $\\mathbb{H}^n$ are homogeneous spaces (specifically, symmetric spaces), the algebraic structure of the curvature tensor is the same at every point. Therefore, the set of generators for $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M)$ can be simplified to the set of endomorphisms $\\{ R(X,Y) : T_{p}M \\to T_{p}M \\mid X,Y \\in T_{p}M \\}$, without needing to consider parallel transport from other points.\n\nThe given form of the curvature tensor for a manifold of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa \\neq 0$ is:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = \\kappa \\big( \\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y \\big)\n$$\nwhere $X, Y, Z$ are tangent vectors in $T_{p}M$.\n\nTo analyze the Lie algebra generated by these endomorphisms, let us choose an orthonormal basis $\\{e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_n\\}$ for the tangent space $T_{p}M$. With respect to this basis, $T_{p}M$ can be identified with $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and the inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ becomes the standard dot product. An endomorphism is then represented by an $n \\times n$ matrix.\n\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be vectors in $T_pM$, represented as column vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The action of the endomorphism $R(X,Y)$ on a vector $Z$ is:\n$R(X,Y)Z = \\kappa \\big( (Y^T Z) X - (X^T Z) Y \\big)$.\nThis can be rewritten using matrix multiplication as:\n$R(X,Y)Z = \\kappa \\big( X(Y^T Z) - Y(X^T Z) \\big) = \\kappa \\big( (XY^T)Z - (YX^T)Z \\big) = \\kappa (XY^T - YX^T)Z$.\nThus, the matrix representing the curvature endomorphism $R(X,Y)$ is $\\kappa (XY^T - YX^T)$. The matrix $XY^T - YX^T$ is skew-symmetric, since $(XY^T - YX^T)^T = (Y^T)^T X^T - (X^T)^T Y^T = YX^T - XY^T = -(XY^T - YX^T)$.\n\nThe set of all $n \\times n$ real skew-symmetric matrices is the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$ of the special orthogonal group $\\mathrm{SO}(n)$. To determine $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M)$, we need to find the Lie algebra generated by all matrices of the form $\\kappa(XY^T - YX^T)$ for all $X,Y \\in T_{p}M$. Since $\\kappa \\neq 0$, this is the same as the algebra generated by matrices of the form $XY^T - YX^T$.\n\nLet us show that these generators span the entire space $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$. A standard basis for $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$ is given by the set of matrices $\\{E_{ij} - E_{ji} \\mid 1 \\leq i  j \\leq n\\}$, where $E_{ij}$ is the matrix with a $1$ in the $(i,j)$ position and zeros elsewhere.\nLet us choose $X=e_i$ and $Y=e_j$ from our orthonormal basis. The corresponding curvature operator matrix (ignoring the factor $\\kappa$) is:\n$e_i e_j^T - e_j e_i^T = E_{ij} - E_{ji}$.\nBy choosing all possible pairs of distinct basis vectors $e_i, e_j$, we can construct all the basis elements of $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$. Therefore, the set of curvature endomorphisms $\\{ R(X,Y) \\mid X,Y \\in T_pM \\}$ generates the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$.\nThus, by the Ambrose–Singer theorem, we have:\n$$\n\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M) = \\mathfrak{so}(n)\n$$\nThis result holds for both $M=S^n$ and $M=\\mathbb{H}^n$.\n\nNow we must determine the holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}(M)$ from its Lie algebra. We are given that $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}(M)$ is a subgroup of the orthogonal group $\\mathrm{O}(n)$. Let $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^0(M)$ be the connected component of the identity of $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}(M)$. $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^0(M)$ is a connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M) = \\mathfrak{so}(n)$.

The full holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}(M)$ is obtained by considering all closed loops based at $p$. The relationship between the full and restricted holonomy groups is that $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}(M)/\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^0(M)$ is a quotient group isomorphic to a subgroup of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M,p)$.\n\nWe are given as a foundational fact that for $n \\geq 2$, both $S^n$ and $\\mathbb{H}^n$ are simply-connected.

We will proceed by first constraining the holonomy group using the Kähler property of the space, then fully determining it using the properties of symmetric spaces, and finally calculating its dimension.\n\nLet $(M, g)$ be the Riemannian manifold $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}$ with the Fubini-Study metric $g$. Let $p \\in M$ be a point. The holonomy group at $p$, denoted $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g)$, is a subgroup of the orthogonal group $\\mathrm{O}(T_{p}M, g_p)$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathrm{O}(2n)$ since the real dimension of $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}$ is $2n$.\n\nFirst, we use the fact that $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}$ with the Fubini-Study metric is a Kähler manifold. By definition, this means there exists a complex structure $J: T_{p}M \\to T_{p}M$ with $J^{2} = -I$ which is compatible with the metric (i.e., $g(JX, JY)=g(X, Y)$ for all $X, Y \\in T_{p}M$) and is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$, i.e., $\\nabla J = 0$.\n\nThe condition $\\nabla J = 0$ implies that parallel transport commutes with $J$. Specifically, for any piecewise smooth loop $\\gamma$ based at $p$, the parallel transport map $P_{\\gamma}: T_{p}M \\to T_{p}M$ satisfies $P_{\\gamma} \\circ J = J \\circ P_{\\gamma}$. Since the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g)$ is generated by all such maps $P_{\\gamma}$, every element $h \\in \\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g)$ must commute with $J$.\n\nAn element of $\\mathrm{O}(2n)$ that commutes with the complex structure $J$ is, by definition, a unitary transformation. The group of such transformations on the tangent space $T_{p}M \\cong \\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is the unitary group $\\mathrm{U}(n)$. Therefore, the holonomy group must be a subgroup of $\\mathrm{U}(n)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g) \\subseteq \\mathrm{U}(n)\n$$\n\nNext, we use the information that $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}$ is an irreducible Riemannian symmetric space. For a simply connected symmetric space represented as a quotient $M = G/K$, where $G$ is the connected component of the identity of the isometry group and $K$ is the isotropy subgroup at a point $p$, a fundamental theorem states that the connected component of the holonomy group, $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}^{0}(g)$, coincides with the image of the connected component of the isotropy group $K_0$ under the isotropy representation. Since $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ for $n \\ge 1$ is simply connected, its holonomy group is connected, so $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(g) = \\mathrm{Hol}_p^0(g)$.\n\nThe problem provides that the isometry group is $G = \\mathrm{SU}(n+1)$ and the isotropy group at a point is $K = S(\\mathrm{U}(n)\\mathrm{U}(1))$. The group $K$ is connected. Thus, $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g)$ is the image of the isotropy representation $\\rho: K \\to \\mathrm{GL}(T_pM)$.\n\nLet us identify the structure of $K$ and its action on $T_pM$. Let the point $p$ be represented by the homogeneous coordinates $[1:0:\\dots:0]$ in $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}$. The isotropy group $K$ at $p$ is the subgroup of $G = \\mathrm{SU}(n+1)$ that fixes the complex line $\\mathbb{C} \\cdot (1,0,\\dots,0)^T$.

The condition that $k \\in \\mathrm{SU}(n+1)$ imposes $\\det(k) = 1$, which means $a \\det(B) = 1$. This is precisely the definition of the group $K = S(\\mathrm{U}(n)\\times\\mathrm{U}(1))$.\n\nThe tangent space $T_{p}(\\mathbb{C}P^{n})$ can be identified with the orthogonal complement of the line $\\mathbb{C} \\cdot (1,0,\\dots,0)^T$ in $\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, which is the space spanned by the standard basis vectors $\\{e_2, \\dots, e_{n+1}\\}$. This space is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. A tangent vector $v \\in T_{p}M$ can be written as $v = (0, w)^T$, where $w \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n}$.\n\nThe isotropy representation $\\rho$ describes the action of $K$ on $T_pM$. For $k \\in K$ and $v \\in T_pM$ as above, the action is given by matrix multiplication:\n$$\n\\rho(k)v = k v = \\begin{pmatrix} a  0 \\\\ 0  B \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ w \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ Bw \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIdentifying $T_{p}M$ with $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ via the map $(0, w)^T \\mapsto w$, the action of $k$ on $w$ is simply $w \\mapsto Bw$. The holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g)$ is the group of all such linear transformations on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. We must determine the set of all matrices $B$ that can appear.\n\nAn element $B \\in \\mathrm{U}(n)$ appears as the lower-right block of some $k \\in K$ if and only if there exists an $a \\in \\mathrm{U}(1)$ such that $a \\det(B) = 1$. For any given $B \\in \\mathrm{U}(n)$, its determinant $\\det(B)$ is a complex number of modulus $1$, i.e., $\\det(B) \\in \\mathrm{U}(1)$. We can always choose $a = (\\det(B))^{-1}$, which is also in $\\mathrm{U}(1)$. With this choice, the matrix $k = \\mathrm{diag}(a, B)$ is an element of $K$. This means that for any $B \\in \\mathrm{U}(n)$, there is a corresponding element in $K$. Therefore, the image of the isotropy representation is the entire unitary group $\\mathrm{U}(n)$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g) = \\mathrm{U}(n)\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the initial constraint $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g) \\subseteq \\mathrm{U}(n)$. The irreducibility of $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ implies that the holonomy group must act irreducibly on $T_p M$, and $\\mathrm{U}(n)$ is indeed a maximal subgroup of $\\mathrm{O}(2n)$ with an irreducible action on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\cong \\mathbb{C}^n$ (for $n1$; for $n=1$, $\\mathrm{U}(1) \\cong \\mathrm{SO}(2)$ is irreducible), confirming our finding.\n\nFinally, we compute the real dimension of the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g) = \\mathrm{U}(n)$. The dimension of a Lie group is the dimension of its Lie algebra. The Lie algebra of $\\mathrm{U}(n)$, denoted $\\mathfrak{u}(n)$, consists of all $n \\times n$ complex matrices $A$ that are skew-hermitian, i.e., $A^{\\dagger} = -A$.\n\nLet an arbitrary matrix $A \\in \\mathfrak{u}(n)$ be written as $A = X + iY$, where $X$ and $Y$ are $n \\times n$ real matrices. The condition $A^{\\dagger}=-A$ becomes:\n$$\n(X + iY)^{\\dagger} = X^T - iY^T = -(X+iY) = -X - iY\n$$\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get two conditions on the real matrices $X$ and $Y$:\n1. $X^T = -X$: $X$ must be a skew-symmetric matrix.\n2. $Y^T = Y$: $Y$ must be a symmetric matrix.\n\nThe real dimension of the space of $n \\times n$ real skew-symmetric matrices is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\nThe real dimension of the space of $n \\times n$ real symmetric matrices is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\n\nThe dimension of $\\mathfrak{u}(n)$ is the sum of these dimensions:\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\mathrm{U}(n)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\mathfrak{u}(n)) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\frac{n^{2} - n + n^{2} + n}{2} = \\frac{2n^{2}}{2} = n^{2}\n$$\nThus, the real dimension of the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g)$ is $n^{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{n^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2968941"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves from high-level structural properties to direct computation using Cartan's powerful moving frame formalism.

Here, $E_i$ are the vector fields dual to the $1$-forms $e^i$.\n\nAs a consequence, the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}(p)$ is a subgroup of $\\mathrm{SO}(3) \\times \\mathrm{SO}(1)$. Since $\\mathrm{SO}(1)$ is the trivial group, $\\mathrm{Hol}(p) \\subseteq \\mathrm{SO}(3)$. The manifold is locally a Riemannian product $(N^3, g_N) \\times (\\mathbb{R}, g_{\\mathbb{R}})$, and the holonomy group of the product is the product of the holonomy groups. The holonomy of $\\mathbb{R}$ is trivial, so $\\mathrm{Hol}(p)$ is isomorphic to the holonomy group of the $3$-dimensional factor $N^3$.\n\nThe Ambrose-Singer theorem states that the Lie algebra of the holonomy group, $\\mathfrak{hol}(p)$, is generated by the curvature operators $R(X,Y)$ for all $X,Y \\in T_pM$. The curvature forms determine the Riemann tensor components via $\\Omega^{i}{}_{j} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k,l} R^{i}{}_{jkl} e^k \\wedge e^l$.\nThe matrix of the curvature operator $R(E_k, E_l)$ has entries $(R(E_k,E_l))^i{}_j = -R^i{}_{jkl}$.\n\nLet's consider the action on the non-trivial subspace $V_3$.\nFrom $\\Omega^{1}{}_{2} = \\lambda^{2} e^{1}\\wedge e^{2}$, we find $R^{1}{}_{212} = \\lambda^{2}$ (and $R^{1}{}_{221} = -\\lambda^{2}$).\nThe operator $R(E_1,E_2)$ has matrix elements $-R^{i}{}_{j12}$. This operator acts non-trivially only on $V_3$. Its matrix representation in the basis $\\{E_1, E_2, E_3\\}$ is:\n$$ [R(E_1,E_2)]_{V_3} = \\begin{pmatrix} -R^1{}_{112}  -R^1{}_{212}  -R^1{}_{312} \\\\ -R^2{}_{112}  -R^2{}_{212}  -R^2{}_{312} \\\\ -R^3{}_{112}  -R^3{}_{212}  -R^3{}_{312} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -\\lambda^2  0 \\\\ \\lambda^2  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis matrix is an element of $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$, specifically $\\lambda^{2}$ times a standard generator.\n\nSimilarly, from $\\Omega^{1}{}_{3} = \\lambda^{2} e^{1}\\wedge e^{3}$ ($R^1{}_{313}=\\lambda^2$) and $\\Omega^{2}{}_{3} = \\lambda^{2} e^{2}\\wedge e^{3}$ ($R^2{}_{323}=\\lambda^2$), we find the matrices for $R(E_1,E_3)$ and $R(E_2,E_3)$ restricted to $V_3$:\n$$ [R(E_1,E_3)]_{V_3} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  -\\lambda^2 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ \\lambda^2  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad [R(E_2,E_3)]_{V_3} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  -\\lambda^2 \\\\ 0  \\lambda^2  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThese three matrices are scalar multiples (by $\\pm\\lambda^2$) of the standard basis matrices for the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$. Since $\\lambda \\neq 0$, these three matrices span $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$. Therefore, the Lie algebra of the holonomy group restricted to $V_3$ is $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$.\n\nThis implies that the holonomy group acts irreducibly on the subspace $V_3$. This action corresponds to the \"irreducible factor\" mentioned in the problem. The Lie algebra of the full holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}^0(p)$ is $\\mathfrak{hol}(p) \\cong \\mathfrak{so}(3)$. A manifold whose holonomy group is $\\mathrm{SO}(n)$ is a space of constant curvature (if it's not a symmetric space, which is also covered by Berger's classification). Our calculation for the sectional curvatures confirms this for the $V_3$ subspace: $K(E_i,E_j)=R_{ijij} = g_{ik}R^k{}_{jij} = \\lambda^2$ for distinct $i,j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. The $3$-dimensional factor is a space of constant positive curvature $\\lambda^2$. For such a space, the holonomy group is $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$.\n\nThe identity component of the holonomy group is the connected Lie group corresponding to the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}(p)$.\nSince $\\mathfrak{hol}(p) = \\mathfrak{so}(3)$, the group $\\mathrm{Hol}^{0}(p)$ is $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$.\nThe dimension of a Lie group is the dimension of its Lie algebra. The dimension of $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is given by $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$.\n\nThus, the dimension of the identity component of the Riemannian holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}^{0}(p)$ is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2968958"}]}
