The bundle $E$ is endowed with the standard Hermitian metric $h$, which corresponds to the standard inner product on $\\mathbb{C}^2$. The frame $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ is given as a constant holomorphic frame, which we take to be the standard basis of $\\mathbb{C}^2$. This frame is orthonormal, i.e., $h(e_i, e_j) = \\delta_{ij}$. Since both the frame and the metric are constant, the associated connection matrix is zero. The Chern connection $D$ on a trivial bundle with a flat metric is simply the exterior derivative $d$. We verify this against the defining properties:\n1.  $D^{0,1} = \\overline{\\partial}$: For any section $u = u_1(z)e_1 + u_2(z)e_2$, $Du = du = (du_1)e_1 + (du_2)e_2$. The $(0,1)$-part is $D^{0,1}u = (\\overline{\\partial}u_1)e_1 + (\\overline{\\partial}u_2)e_2 = \\overline{\\partial}u$, which matches the component-wise Dolbeault operator.\n2.  $D h = 0$: For sections $u, v$, we must have $d(h(u,v)) = h(Du,v) + h(u,Dv)$. Since $h$ is given by the constant matrix $I$, $h(u,v) = u_1\\overline{v_1} + u_2\\overline{v_2}$. Then $d(h(u,v)) = d(u_1\\overline{v_1} + u_2\\overline{v_2}) = (du_1)\\overline{v_1} + u_1 d(\\overline{v_1}) + (du_2)\\overline{v_2} + u_2 d(\\overline{v_2})$. On the other hand, $h(Du,v) = h((du_1)e_1+(du_2)e_2, v_1e_1+v_2e_2) = (du_1)\\overline{v_1}+(du_2)\\overline{v_2}$. Similarly, $h(u,Dv) = h(u_1e_1+u_2e_2, (dv_1)e_1+(dv_2)e_2) = u_1\\overline{dv_1} + u_2\\overline{dv_2}$. As $d(\\overline{f}) = \\overline{\\overline{\\partial}f + \\partial f} = \\partial\\overline{f} + \\overline{\\partial}\\overline{f} = d\\overline{f}$, we see that $u_1 d(\\overline{v_1}) = u_1 \\overline{dv_1}$, and so the condition is satisfied.\nThus, $D=d = \\partial + \\overline{\\partial}$, which implies $D^{1,0} = \\partial$.\n\n### Part 1: General Expression for the Second Fundamental Form\n\nThe line subbundle $S$ is generated by the holomorphic section $s(z) = e_1 + a(z)e_2$. We first construct an orthonormal frame for $E$ adapted to the orthogonal decomposition $E = S \\oplus S^\\perp$.\n\nThe norm-squared of the section $s$ is:\n$$h(s,s) = h(e_1+a(z)e_2, e_1+a(z)e_2) = h(e_1, e_1) + a(z)\\overline{a(z)}h(e_2,e_2) = 1 + |a(z)|^2$$\nA unit frame for $S$ is thus:\n$$\\widehat{s}(z) = \\frac{s(z)}{\\sqrt{1+|a(z)|^2}} = \\frac{e_1+a(z)e_2}{\\sqrt{1+|a(z)|^2}}$$\nTo find a frame for the orthogonal complement $S^\\perp$, we seek a section $v(z)$ such that $h(s,v)=0$. Let $v=v_1 e_1 + v_2 e_2$. The condition $h(s,v) = h(e_1+ae_2, v_1e_1+v_2e_2) = 1\\cdot\\overline{v_1} + a\\cdot\\overline{v_2} = 0$. A simple non-trivial choice is $\\overline{v_1} = -a$ and $\\overline{v_2} = 1$, which gives $v_1 = -\\overline{a}$ and $v_2=1$. So, a spanning section for $S^\\perp$ is $v(z) = -\\overline{a(z)}e_1 + e_2$.\nThe norm-squared of $v$ is:\n$$h(v,v) = h(-\\overline{a}e_1+e_2, -\\overline{a}e_1+e_2) = (-\\overline{a})\\overline{(-\\overline{a})}h(e_1,e_1) + 1\\cdot\\overline{1}h(e_2,e_2) = |a|^2+1$$\nA unit frame for $S^\\perp$ is:\n$$\\widehat{v}(z) = \\frac{v(z)}{\\sqrt{1+|a(z)|^2}} = \\frac{-\\overline{a(z)}e_1+e_2}{\\sqrt{1+|a(z)|^2}}$$\nThe second fundamental form $B$ is defined as $B = P^\\perp \\circ D^{1,0}|_S$. We wish to find $b(z)$ in the expression $B(\\widehat{s}) = b(z)dz \\otimes \\widehat{v}$.\nInstead of computing $D^{1,0}\\widehat{s}$ directly, we compute $B(s)$ first. As $s$ is a holomorphic section, $\\overline{\\partial}s=0$, so $Ds = ds = \\partial s$.\n$$D^{1,0}s = \\partial s = \\partial(e_1 + a(z)e_2) = (\\partial a)e_2$$\nSince $a(z)$ is a holomorphic function, its derivative is a $(1,0)$-form: $\\partial a = \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial z} dz = a'(z)dz$.\n$$D^{1,0}s = a'(z)dz \\otimes e_2$$\nThe projection onto $S^\\perp$ is given by $P^\\perp(w) = h(w, \\widehat{v})\\widehat{v}$ for any $w \\in \\Gamma(E)$. Thus,\n$$B(s) = P^\\perp(D^{1,0}s) = h(a'(z)dz \\otimes e_2, \\widehat{v})\\widehat{v} = (a'(z)dz) \\otimes h(e_2, \\widehat{v})\\widehat{v}$$\nWe compute the inner product:\n$$h(e_2, \\widehat{v}) = h\\left(e_2, \\frac{-\\overline{a}e_1+e_2}{\\sqrt{1+|a|^2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+|a|^2}} h(e_2, -\\overline{a}e_1+e_2)$$\n$$h(e_2, -\\overline{a}e_1+e_2) = \\overline{(-\\overline{a})}h(e_2,e_1) + \\overline{1}h(e_2,e_2) = a \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$$\nSo, $h(e_2, \\widehat{v}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+|a|^2}}$. Substituting this back, we get:\n$$B(s) = \\frac{a'(z)}{\\sqrt{1+|a|^2}} dz \\otimes \\widehat{v}$$\nThe operator $B$ is a tensor, which is linear over the ring of smooth functions. Using $\\widehat{s} = (1+|a|^2)^{-1/2}s$, we have:\n$$B(\\widehat{s}) = B\\left((1+|a|^2)^{-1/2}s\\right) = (1+|a|^2)^{-1/2}B(s)$$\n$$B(\\widehat{s}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+|a|^2}} \\left( \\frac{a'(z)}{\\sqrt{1+|a|^2}} dz \\otimes \\widehat{v} \\right) = \\frac{a'(z)}{1+|a(z)|^2} dz \\otimes \\widehat{v}$$\nComparing this with the desired form $B(\\widehat{s}) = b(z)dz \\otimes \\widehat{v}$, we identify the scalar function $b(z)$ as:\n$$b(z) = \\frac{a'(z)}{1+|a(z)|^2}$$\n\n### Part 2: Concrete Case $a(z)=z^2$\n\nWe are given the specific holomorphic function $a(z) = z^2$.\nThe $(1,0)$-derivative is $a'(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}(z^2) = 2z$.\nThe modulus squared is $|a(z)|^2 = |z^2|^2 = (|z|^2)^2 = |z|^4$.\nSubstituting these into our general expression for $b(z)$:\n$$b(z) = \\frac{2z}{1+|z|^4}$$\n\n### Part 3: Condition for a Parallel Subbundle\n\nAccording to the problem definition, the subbundle $S$ is parallel with respect to the Chern connection $D$ if and only if its second fundamental form $B$ is identically zero, i.e., $B \\equiv 0$.\nThe operator $B$ acts on sections of $S$. For $B$ to be identically zero, its action on any section must be zero. It suffices to check this on the frame field $\\widehat{s}$.\nThe condition $B \\equiv 0$ is equivalent to $B(\\widehat{s}) \\equiv 0$. From Part 1, we have:\n$$B(\\widehat{s}) = \\frac{a'(z)}{1+|a(z)|^2} dz \\otimes \\widehat{v}$$\nThe section $\\widehat{v}$ is non-zero, and the form $dz$ is non-zero on the disk $X$. The denominator $1+|a(z)|^2 \\geq 1$ and is never zero. Therefore, $B(\\widehat{s})$ is identically zero if and only if its scalar coefficient is identically zero.\nThe necessary and sufficient pointwise condition on $B$ for $S$ to be parallel is that its coefficient form $b(z)dz$ is zero. This requires $b(z)$ to be identically zero for all $z \\in X$.\nIn terms of the function $a$, this means:\n$$\\frac{a'(z)}{1+|a(z)|^2} \\equiv 0 \\quad \\iff \\quad a'(z) \\equiv 0$$\nSince $a(z)$ is a holomorphic function on a connected domain $X$ (the unit disk), the condition $a'(z) \\equiv 0$ implies that $a(z)$ must be a constant, say $a(z)=c$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThis result is conceptually sound. If $a(z)=c$ is a constant, then the subbundle $S$ is spanned by the constant section $s = e_1+ce_2$. The Chern connection is $D=d$. For any section $\\sigma(z)=f(z)s \\in \\Gamma(S)$, its covariant derivative is $D\\sigma = d(fs) = (df)s + f(ds)$. Since $s$ is constant, $ds=0$. Thus $D\\sigma = (df)s$, which is again a section of $S$ (tensored with $\\Omega^1(X)$). This means $D$ preserves the subbundle $S$, i.e., $D(\\Gamma(S)) \\subset \\Gamma(S \\otimes \\Omega^1(X))$. By definition, $S$ is a parallel subbundle. Consequently, the second fundamental form $B$, which measures the failure of $D$ to preserve $S$ by projecting the derivative into the orthogonal complement, must be zero. This confirms our derived condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2z}{1+|z|^{4}}}$$", "id": "2993362"}]}
