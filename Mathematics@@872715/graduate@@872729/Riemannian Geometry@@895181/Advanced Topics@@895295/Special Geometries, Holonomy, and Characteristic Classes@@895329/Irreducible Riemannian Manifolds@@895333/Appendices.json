We will address the three parts of the problem in sequence.\n\n1.  We first demonstrate that the canonical splitting of the tangent bundle $T(S^2 \\times S^2) = E_1 \\oplus E_2$ is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ of $g$. Let $(M_1, g_1)$ and $(M_2, g_2)$ be two Riemannian manifolds. Their Riemannian product is the manifold $M = M_1 \\times M_2$ with the metric $g = g_1 \\oplus g_2$. Let us use local coordinates $(x^i)$ for a chart on $M_1$ and $(y^a)$ for a chart on $M_2$. Then $(x^i, y^a)$ form local coordinates for a chart on $M$. The metric tensor $g$ on $M$ has components $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ which form a block-diagonal matrix:\n    $$\n    (g_{\\mu\\nu}) = \\begin{pmatrix} (g_{1, ij}(x)) & 0 \\\\ 0 & (g_{2, ab}(y)) \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    where $g_{1, ij}$ are the components of $g_1$ depending only on the $x^i$ coordinates, and $g_{2, ab}$ are the components of $g_2$ depending only on the $y^a$ coordinates. The Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}$ of the Levi-Civita connection are given by the Koszul formula. Due to the block-diagonal structure of the metric and its inverse $g^{\\mu\\nu}$, and the separate dependence of the blocks on their respective coordinates, the Christoffel symbols are zero unless all three indices belong to the same coordinate group. That is, the only potentially non-zero symbols are $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ (computed from $g_1$) and $\\Gamma^c_{ab}$ (computed from $g_2$). All mixed-index Christoffel symbols, such as $\\Gamma^k_{ab}$, $\\Gamma^a_{ij}$, $\\Gamma^i_{ja}$, etc., are identically zero.\n\n    The subbundle $E_1$ is the distribution of vectors tangent to the first $S^2$ factor, and $E_2$ is the distribution tangent to the second. A local basis for $E_1$ is $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\}$ and for $E_2$ is $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}\\}$. To show $E_1$ is parallel, we must show that for any vector field $X \\in \\mathfrak{X}(M)$ and any section $Y \\in \\Gamma(E_1)$, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_X Y$ is also a section of $E_1$. Let $Y=Y^j(x,y)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$. We calculate its covariant derivative along a basis vector field, say $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}$:\n    $$\n    \\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} Y = \\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} \\left(Y^j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial Y^j}{\\partial y^a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} + Y^j \\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\n    $$\n    Using the definition of Christoffel symbols, $\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} = \\Gamma^k_{aj} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k} + \\Gamma^c_{aj} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^c}$. Since the mixed symbols $\\Gamma^k_{aj}$ and $\\Gamma^c_{aj}$ are zero, we have $\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} = 0$. Thus, $\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} Y = \\frac{\\partial Y^j}{\\partial y^a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$, which is a section of $E_1$. A similar calculation for $\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}} Y$ also results in a section of $E_1$. Since any vector field $X$ is a linear combination of these basis fields, it follows by linearity that $\\nabla_X Y \\in \\Gamma(E_1)$. Therefore, $E_1$ is a parallel subbundle. An identical argument holds for $E_2$.\n\n2.  Next, we analyze the manifold in the context of the de Rham decomposition theorem.\n    The $2$-sphere $S^2$ with its standard round metric is a compact Riemannian manifold. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, a compact Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete. The Riemannian product of two complete manifolds is itself complete. Thus, $M = S^2 \\times S^2$, being the product of two complete manifolds, is complete.\n    The fundamental group of a product space is the product of the fundamental groups: $\\pi_1(X \\times Y) \\cong \\pi_1(X) \\times \\pi_1(Y)$. For the sphere $S^n$ with $n \\ge 2$, the fundamental group is trivial, i.e., $\\pi_1(S^n)=\\{e\\}$. Thus, $\\pi_1(M) = \\pi_1(S^2 \\times S^2) \\cong \\pi_1(S^2) \\times \\pi_1(S^2) \\cong \\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$, which is the trivial group. This establishes that $M$ is simply connected.\n\n    The de Rham decomposition theorem states that any complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ splits uniquely (up to isometry and reordering) as a Riemannian product $(M,g) \\cong (\\mathbb{R}^k, g_{Euc}) \\times (M_1, g_1) \\times \\dots \\times (M_r, g_r)$, where $(\\mathbb{R}^k, g_{Euc})$ is a Euclidean factor and each $(M_i, g_i)$ is an irreducible, complete, and simply connected Riemannian manifold. A manifold is irreducible if its holonomy group acts irreducibly on its tangent space.\n    The parallel splitting $TM = E_1 \\oplus E_2$ implies that the holonomy group of $M$ is reducible, as any parallel transported vector initially in $E_1$ (or $E_2$) remains in $E_1$ (or $E_2$). Therefore, $(M,g)$ is a reducible manifold. The de Rham theorem guarantees that this corresponds to a product decomposition. The factors correspond to the integral manifolds of the parallel distributions $E_1$ and $E_2$, which are precisely the two $S^2$ factors. The decomposition is $(M,g) \\cong (S^2, g_{S^2}) \\times (S^2, g_{S^2})$.\n    To confirm this is the final decomposition into irreducible factors, we must check that $(S^2, g_{S^2})$ is irreducible. The holonomy group of the standard $n$-sphere ($n \\ge 2$) at any point $p$ is $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(S^n) = \\mathrm{SO}(n)$. For $S^2$, this is $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(S^2) = \\mathrm{SO}(2)$. The group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ acts on the tangent space $T_p S^2 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ by rotations. This action is irreducible because there is no non-trivial proper subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that is invariant under all rotations. Thus, $(S^2, g_{S^2})$ is an irreducible Riemannian manifold. The de Rham decomposition of $(M,g)$ is therefore into the two irreducible factors: $(S^2, g_{S^2}) \\times (S^2, g_{S^2})$.\n\n3.  Finally, we determine the restricted holonomy group at $o=(p,q) \\in M$. As $M$ is simply connected, the restricted holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_o^0(M)$ is the same as the full holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_o(M)$. For a Riemannian product $M_1 \\times M_2$, the holonomy group at a point $(p_1, p_2)$ is isomorphic to the direct product of the holonomy groups of the factors: $\\mathrm{Hol}_{(p_1,p_2)}(M_1 \\times M_2) \\cong \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_1}(M_1) \\times \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_2}(M_2)$.\n    Applying this to our case, $\\mathrm{Hol}_o(M) \\cong \\mathrm{Hol}_p(S^2) \\times \\mathrm{Hol}_q(S^2)$. Since $\\mathrm{Hol}(S^2) = \\mathrm{SO}(2)$, we have $\\mathrm{Hol}_o(M) \\cong \\mathrm{SO}(2) \\times \\mathrm{SO}(2)$.\n    This group acts on the tangent space $T_oM = T_pS^2 \\oplus T_qS^2$. The action is reducible, with $T_pS^2$ and $T_qS^2$ being invariant subspaces. Let us choose an orthonormal basis for $T_oM$ adapted to this splitting. Let $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $T_pS^2$ and $\\{e_3, e_4\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $T_qS^2$. Then $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $T_oM$.\n    A general element of $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ can be represented by a rotation matrix $R(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    A typical element of the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_o(M)$ corresponds to a pair of rotations, one acting on $T_pS^2$ with angle $\\theta_1$ and another acting on $T_qS^2$ with angle $\\theta_2$. In the chosen basis, this element is represented by a $4 \\times 4$ block-diagonal matrix:\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    R(\\theta_1) & \\mathbf{0}_{2\\times2} \\\\\n    \\mathbf{0}_{2\\times2} & R(\\theta_2)\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\cos\\theta_1 & -\\sin\\theta_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    \\sin\\theta_1 & \\cos\\theta_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & \\cos\\theta_2 & -\\sin\\theta_2 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & \\sin\\theta_2 & \\cos\\theta_2\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    This is the explicit matrix representation of a general element of the restricted holonomy group at $o$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\theta_{1} & -\\sin\\theta_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\sin\\theta_{1} & \\cos\\theta_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cos\\theta_{2} & -\\sin\\theta_{2} \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\sin\\theta_{2} & \\cos\\theta_{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2994424"}, {"introduction": "Not all reducible manifolds arise from non-trivial product decompositions. This practice explores the important case of a flat complex torus, where the holonomy group is trivial—the most extreme form of reducibility.

This is a complex torus of complex dimension $n$, which has a real dimension of $2n$. The manifold $X$ is obtained as a quotient of $\\mathbb{C}^{n} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ by a full lattice $\\Lambda$. The projection map $\\pi: \\mathbb{C}^{n} \\to X$ is the universal covering map. The metric $g$ on $X$ is induced from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, which we can write in standard coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^{2n})$ as $ds^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{2n} (dx^i)^2$. In these coordinates, the metric tensor components are constant: $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ associated with the metric $g$ is characterized by the Christoffel symbols, $\\Gamma_{ij}^k$, which are computed using the formula:\n$$ \\Gamma_{ij}^k = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right) $$\nSince the metric components $g_{ij}$ are constant in the Euclidean coordinates on the universal cover $\\mathbb{C}^n$, all their partial derivatives are zero. Consequently, all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma_{ij}^k$ are identically zero in this coordinate system.\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is determined by the Christoffel symbols. Its components in a coordinate basis are given by:\n$$ R^i_{jkl} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^i_{jl}}{\\partial x^k} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^i_{jk}}{\\partial x^l} + \\sum_{m=1}^{2n} \\left( \\Gamma^m_{jl}\\Gamma^i_{mk} - \\Gamma^m_{jk}\\Gamma^i_{ml} \\right) $$\nSince all $\\Gamma_{ij}^k = 0$, it immediately follows that the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is identically zero. This confirms that the metric $g$ is flat, meaning the manifold $(X, g)$ is locally isometric to Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.\n\nNext, we compute the parallel transport operator. The equation for a vector field $V$ to be parallel along a curve $\\gamma(t)$ is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)}V = 0$. In our chosen coordinates, this equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dV^k}{dt} + \\sum_{i,j=1}^{2n} \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{dx^i}{dt} V^j = 0 $$\nBecause $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$, the condition for parallel transport becomes simply $\\frac{dV^k}{dt} = 0$ for each component $k=1, \\dots, 2n$. This means that the components of a vector with respect to the standard constant orthonormal frame $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2n}}\\}$ on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ remain constant during parallel transport. On the universal cover $\\mathbb{C}^n$, parallel transport along any path is equivalent to the identity map on the vector components.\n\nNow, consider a loop $\\gamma: [0,1] \\to X$ based at a point $p \\in X$. Such a loop can be lifted to a path $\\tilde{\\gamma}: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{C}^n$ in the universal cover. Let $\\tilde{p} \\in \\mathbb{C}^n$ be a point such that $\\pi(\\tilde{p})=p$. We set $\\tilde{\\gamma}(0) = \\tilde{p}$. Since $\\gamma(1) = \\gamma(0) = p$, the endpoint of the lifted path, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)$, must lie in the fiber over $p$, which is the set of points $\\{\\tilde{p} + \\lambda \\mid \\lambda \\in \\Lambda\\}$. Thus, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1) = \\tilde{p} + \\lambda_{\\gamma}$ for some unique lattice vector $\\lambda_{\\gamma} \\in \\Lambda$. The problem asks to consider a loop $\\gamma$ that is a generator of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X,p)$. The fundamental group is isomorphic to the lattice, $\\pi_1(X,p) \\cong \\Lambda$. So, such a loop corresponds to a path $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ connecting $\\tilde{p}$ to $\\tilde{p}+\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is a generator of the lattice $\\Lambda$.\n\nTo compute the parallel transport operator $P_{\\gamma}: T_p X \\to T_p X$, we take a vector $v \\in T_p X$. We lift it to a vector $\\tilde{v} \\in T_{\\tilde{p}}\\mathbb{C}^n$ via the inverse of the differential of the projection map, $(d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}})^{-1}$. We then parallel transport $\\tilde{v}$ along the lifted path $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ from $\\tilde{p}$ to $\\tilde{p}+\\lambda$. As established, the components of the transported vector, $\\tilde{v}' \\in T_{\\tilde{p}+\\lambda}\\mathbb{C}^n$, are identical to the components of $\\tilde{v}$ in the constant orthonormal frame. Finally, we project $\\tilde{v}'$ back down to $T_p X$ via the map $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}+\\lambda}$.\nThe tangent spaces $T_q \\mathbb{C}^n$ for any $q \\in \\mathbb{C}^n$ are canonically identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, and the differentials $d\\pi_q$ provide isometries to $T_{\\pi(q)}X$. The constant orthonormal frame field on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ gives a basis for each tangent space. Since the components of the vector do not change during parallel transport on $\\mathbb{C}^n$, and the identifications of tangent spaces at $\\tilde{p}$ and $\\tilde{p}+\\lambda$ with $T_pX$ are compatible, the resulting vector in $T_p X$ is identical to the original vector $v$.\nTherefore, the parallel transport operator $P_{\\gamma}$ is the identity map on $T_p X$. Expressed as a matrix with respect to any basis (including the specified constant global orthonormal frame), this is the $2n \\times 2n$ identity matrix, which we denote by $I_{2n}$.\n\nThe holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_p(g)$ is the group of all such parallel transport operators $P_{\\gamma}$ for all piecewise smooth loops $\\gamma$ based at $p$. Since the operators corresponding to the generators of $\\pi_1(X,p)$ are all the identity matrix, and any loop is homotopic to a composition of such generators, the parallel transport for any loop is also the identity. Thus, the holonomy group is the trivial group: $\\operatorname{Hol}_p(g) = \\{I_{2n}\\}$.\n\nFinally, we address why the holonomy is trivial and not $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$, despite $(X,g,J)$ being a compact Kähler manifold with first Chern class $c_1(X)=0$.\n1.  A key theorem, stemming from Yau's proof of the Calabi conjecture, states that a compact, *simply connected* Kähler manifold with $c_1=0$ admits a unique Ricci-flat Kähler metric, and its holonomy group is a subgroup of $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$ (specifically $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$ or $\\mathrm{Sp}(m)$ if irreducible). The complex torus $X$ is not simply connected; its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\Lambda \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{2n}$. This is a crucial distinction.\n2.  For any Riemannian manifold, the holonomy algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}(g)$ (the Lie algebra of the *restricted* holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(g)$) is generated by the curvature operators. Since our metric is flat, the Riemann curvature tensor is zero, $R=0$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{hol}(g) = \\{0\\}$, which implies that the restricted holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(g)$ (from contractible loops) is the trivial group $\\{I_{2n}\\}$.\n3.  The general result for a compact Kähler manifold with $c_1=0$ is that its restricted holonomy group is a subgroup of $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$, i.e., $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(g) \\subseteq \\mathrm{SU}(n)$. Our finding that $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(g) = \\{I_{2n}\\}$ is perfectly consistent with this, as the trivial group is a subgroup of any group, including $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$.\n4.  The full holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}(g)$ can be larger than $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(g)$ on non-simply connected manifolds. However, as we calculated directly, the parallel transport around non-contractible loops is also trivial for this specific flat metric. Therefore, the full holonomy group is also trivial, $\\operatorname{Hol}(g)=\\{I_{2n}\\}$.\n5.  In the context of Berger's classification and the de Rham decomposition theorem, any compact Kähler manifold with $c_1=0$ splits isometrically into a product $T^k \\times M_1 \\times \\dots \\times M_r$, where $T^k$ is a flat torus and each $M_i$ is a simply connected manifold with holonomy $\\mathrm{SU}(n_i)$ or $\\mathrm{Sp}(m_i)$. The manifold in this problem, $X$, corresponds to the case where the product is just the torus factor. Manifolds with holonomy $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$ are Ricci-flat but are not flat ($R\\neq 0$). The flat torus is the unique case of a compact Ricci-flat Kähler manifold that is also flat, and its flatness forces the holonomy to be trivial.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{I_{2n}}\n$$", "id": "2968934"}, {"introduction": "After examining reducible cases, we now turn to a constructive example of an irreducible manifold, which often cannot be decomposed as a product.

As the base manifold is Kähler, this structure is also normal, making $(P, \\eta, \\xi, \\Phi, g)$ a Sasakian manifold.\n\nEssential identities for a Sasakian manifold (scaled by $k$) include the covariant derivatives of $\\xi$ and $\\Phi$.\nFor a horizontal vector field $X$, the covariant derivative of $\\xi$ is given by $\\nabla_X \\xi = -k\\Phi X$. This can be derived from the Koszul formula or O'Neill's formulas. Furthermore, $\\nabla_\\xi \\xi = 0$ as $\\xi$ defines a flow of isometries and has unit length, making its integral curves geodesics.\nThe covariant derivative of $\\Phi$ is given by $(\\nabla_X \\Phi)Y = k(g(X,Y)\\xi - \\eta(Y)X)$ for any vector fields $X, Y$.\n\nStep 2: The Riemann Curvature Tensor\nThe Ambrose-Singer theorem states that the Lie algebra of the holonomy group, $\\mathfrak{hol}(p)$, is generated by the curvature endomorphisms $R(U,V) = \\nabla_U \\nabla_V - \\nabla_V \\nabla_U - \\nabla_{[U,V]}$ for all $U,V \\in T_p P$. We compute the key components of $R$.\n\n- Curvature for horizontal inputs: For horizontal vector fields $X, Y, Z$, the curvature $R(X,Y)Z$ can be related to the curvature $R^B$ of the base manifold $B$ by O'Neill's formula, which for a Sasakian manifold over a Kähler manifold simplifies to:\n$$R(X,Y)Z = R^B(X,Y)Z - k^2 \\left( g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y + g(\\Phi Y,Z)\\Phi X - g(\\Phi X,Z)\\Phi Y - 2g(\\Phi X,Y)\\Phi Z \\right)$$\nwhere $R^B(X,Y)Z$ is the horizontal lift of $R^B_{\\pi_*X, \\pi_*Y}(\\pi_*Z)$.\nFurthermore, $R(X,Y)\\xi = 0$. This indicates that curvature operators with only horizontal inputs preserve the horizontal-vertical decomposition.\n\n- Curvature with a vertical input: The crucial components are those involving $\\xi$, as they can mix the horizontal and vertical subspaces. We compute $R(X,\\xi)Y$ for horizontal $X,Y$:\n$$R(X,\\xi)Y = \\nabla_X(\\nabla_\\xi Y) - \\nabla_\\xi(\\nabla_X Y) - \\nabla_{[X,\\xi]}Y$$\nUsing Sasakian identities, one can show $\\nabla_\\xi Y = -k\\Phi Y - [\\xi,X]_h$ for a horizontal $Y$. If we choose a basic horizontal field $Y$ (lift of a field from $B$), then $[\\xi,Y]=0$ and $\\nabla_\\xi Y = -k\\Phi Y$.\n$\\nabla_X(\\nabla_\\xi Y) = \\nabla_X(-k\\Phi Y) = -k(\\nabla_X\\Phi)Y - k\\Phi(\\nabla_X Y) = -k(k g(X,Y)\\xi) - k\\Phi(\\nabla_X Y)$.\n$\\nabla_\\xi(\\nabla_X Y)$ can also be computed, and the result simplifies to:\n$$R(X,\\xi)Y = -k^2 g(X,Y)\\xi$$\nThis shows that $R(X,\\xi)$ maps a horizontal vector $Y$ to a vertical vector.\n\nNext, we compute the action on $\\xi$:\n$$R(X,\\xi)\\xi = \\nabla_X(\\nabla_\\xi\\xi) - \\nabla_\\xi(\\nabla_X\\xi) - \\nabla_{[X,\\xi]}\\xi$$\nSince $\\nabla_\\xi\\xi=0$ and $\\nabla_X\\xi=-k\\Phi X$, we have:\n$$R(X,\\xi)\\xi = -\\nabla_\\xi(-k\\Phi X) - \\nabla_{[X,\\xi]}\\xi$$\nAssuming a basic field $X$, $[\\xi,X]=0$. Then $(\\nabla_\\xi \\Phi)X = 0$. Thus, $\\nabla_\\xi(-k\\Phi X) = -k\\Phi(\\nabla_\\xi X) = -k\\Phi(-k\\Phi X) = k^2\\Phi^2 X = -k^2 X$.\nSo, $R(X,\\xi)\\xi = -(-k^2 X) = k^2 X$.\nThis shows that $R(X,\\xi)$ maps the vertical vector $\\xi$ to a horizontal vector.\n\nStep 3: Irreducibility of the Holonomy Representation\nThe holonomy representation on $T_p P$ is irreducible if there are no proper non-trivial subspaces of $T_p P$ that are invariant under all curvature endomorphisms $R(U,V)$.\nLet $W$ be an invariant subspace of $T_p P$.\n- Suppose $W$ contains a non-zero horizontal vector $X_0 \\in H_p$. Then for any $Y \\in H_p$ such that $g(X_0, Y) \\neq 0$ (e.g., $Y=X_0$), the vector $R(X_0, \\xi)Y = -k^2 g(X_0,Y)\\xi$ must be in $W$. Since $k \\neq 0$ and $g(X_0,X_0) \\neq 0$, this implies that $\\xi \\in W$.\n- Suppose $W$ contains the vector $\\xi$. Then for any non-zero horizontal vector $X \\in H_p$, the vector $R(X,\\xi)\\xi = k^2 X$ must be in $W$. Since $k \\neq 0$, this means every horizontal vector $X$ is in $W$. Thus, $H_p \\subseteq W$.\n\nCombining these, if a non-zero invariant subspace $W$ contains any single non-zero vector (horizontal or vertical), it must contain all of $H_p$ and $\\operatorname{span}\\{\\xi\\}$, so $W=T_p P$. The only invariant subspaces are $\\{0\\}$ and $T_p P$.\nTherefore, the holonomy representation is irreducible. The condition for this is $k \\neq 0$, which is given in the problem statement.\n\nStep 4: Identification of the Holonomy Algebra and its Dimension\nSince $(P,g)$ is a simply connected (or considering the restricted holonomy group on a non-simply connected space) irreducible Riemannian manifold of dimension $2n+1$, its holonomy group must be on Berger's list. For an odd-dimensional manifold of dimension $m=2n+1 \\ge 5$ (since $n \\ge 2$), the only possibilities for a non-symmetric space are $\\operatorname{SO}(2n+1)$ or, if $2n+1=7$, the exceptional group $G_2$. A $G_2$ manifold must be Ricci-flat. The Ricci tensor of $(P,g)$ is not zero (e.g., $R(\\xi,\\xi)=2nk^2$), so the holonomy cannot be $G_2$.\nThe holonomy group must therefore be $\\operatorname{SO}(2n+1)$.\n\nWe can confirm this by examining the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}(p)$ generated by the curvature endomorphisms.\nThe operators $R(X,\\xi)$ for $X \\in H_p$ generate a subspace of $\\mathfrak{hol}(p)$. Let's consider the commutator of two such operators, $[R(X,\\xi), R(Y,\\xi)]$.\nA direct computation shows that for any $Z \\in H_p$:\n$$[R(X,\\xi), R(Y,\\xi)](Z) = k^4 (g(X,Z)Y - g(Y,Z)X)$$\nAnd $[R(X,\\xi), R(Y,\\xi)](\\xi)=0$.\nThe set of operators $Z \\mapsto g(X,Z)Y - g(Y,Z)X$ for all $X,Y \\in H_p$ generates the entire Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(H_p) \\cong \\mathfrak{so}(2n)$. Since $k \\neq 0$, the commutators generate a subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{hol}(p)$ isomorphic to $\\mathfrak{so}(2n)$, which acts on $H_p$.\nThe algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}(p)$ also contains the operators $R(X,\\xi)$ themselves, which provide the \"mixing\" components between $H_p$ and $V_p$. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(2n+1)$ can be represented by block matrices $\\begin{pmatrix} A & -v^T \\\\ v & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ where $A \\in \\mathfrak{so}(2n)$ and $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. Our generated algebra contains all such matrices.\nThus, the Lie algebra of the restricted holonomy group is $\\mathfrak{hol}(p) = \\mathfrak{so}(2n+1)$.\n\nThe restricted holonomy group is $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(P,g) = \\operatorname{SO}(2n+1)$.\nThe problem asks for the real dimension of this group. The dimension of the special orthogonal group $\\operatorname{SO}(m)$ is given by $\\binom{m}{2} = \\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$.\nFor $m=2n+1$, the dimension is:\n$$\\dim(\\operatorname{SO}(2n+1)) = \\frac{(2n+1)((2n+1)-1)}{2} = \\frac{(2n+1)(2n)}{2} = n(2n+1) = 2n^2 + n$$\nThis is the real dimension of the restricted holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(P,g)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2n^{2} + n}$$", "id": "2981105"}]}
