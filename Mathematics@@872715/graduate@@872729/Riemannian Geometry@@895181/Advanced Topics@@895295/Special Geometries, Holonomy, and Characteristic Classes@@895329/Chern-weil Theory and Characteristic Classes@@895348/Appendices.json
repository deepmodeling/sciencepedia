For a short exact sequence of vector bundles $0 \\to E' \\to E \\to E'' \\to 0$, the Whitney sum property implies that the total Chern class of the middle bundle is the product of the total Chern classes of the outer bundles: $c(E) = c(E') c(E'')$.\n\nApplying this to our sequence, we get:\n$$c(\\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus 3}) = c(\\mathcal{O}) c(T^{1,0}M)$$\nThe total Chern class of the trivial line bundle $\\mathcal{O}$ is $c(\\mathcal{O}) = 1$. The total Chern class of a direct sum (Whitney sum) of bundles is the product of their individual total Chern classes.

The power sum symmetric polynomials $p_k = \\sum_{i=1}^r x_i^k$ are related to the elementary symmetric polynomials $e_k = c_k = \\sum_{1 \\le i_1 < \\dots < i_k \\le r} x_{i_1}\\dots x_{i_k}$. We have $p_1 = e_1$ and $p_2 = e_1 p_1 - 2e_2$.\nIn our notation, $\\sum x_i = c_1$ and $\\sum x_i^2 = c_1^2 - 2c_2$.\nThus, the degree-$4$ component is:\n$$ [\\mathrm{ch}(E)]_4 = \\frac{1}{2}(c_1^2 - 2c_2) = \\frac{1}{2}c_1^2 - c_2 $$\nSo, the expansion of the Chern character up to degree $4$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{ch}(E) = r + c_1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}c_1^2 - c_2\\right) + \\dots $$\n\nNext, we expand the Todd class $\\mathrm{Td}(E)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Td}(E) = \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{x_i}{1 - \\exp(-x_i)} $$\nFirst, we find the Taylor series for the generating function $f(x) = \\frac{x}{1 - \\exp(-x)}$:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{x}{1 - \\left(1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\dots\\right)} = \\frac{x}{x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{6} - \\dots} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x^2}{6} - \\dots} $$\nUsing the geometric series expansion $1/(1-u) = 1+u+u^2+\\dots$ with $u = \\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{x^2}{6} + \\dots$:\n$$ f(x) = 1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{x^2}{6}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 + O(x^3) = 1 + \\frac{x}{2} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)x^2 + O(x^3) = 1 + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x^2}{12} + O(x^3) $$\nNow we compute the product for $\\mathrm{Td}(E)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Td}(E) = \\prod_{i=1}^r \\left(1 + \\frac{x_i}{2} + \\frac{x_i^2}{12} + \\dots\\right) $$\nDegree-$0$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_0 = 1 $$\nDegree-$2$: This comes from picking the $\\frac{x_i}{2}$ term from one factor and $1$ from all others.\n$$ [\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_2 = \\sum_{i=1}^r \\frac{x_i}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^r x_i = \\frac{1}{2}c_1 $$\nDegree-$4$: This has two contributions: picking $\\frac{x_i^2}{12}$ from one factor and $1$ from others, or picking $\\frac{x_i}{2}$ from one factor and $\\frac{x_j}{2}$ from another ($i \\ne j$).\n$$ [\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_4 = \\sum_{i=1}^r \\frac{x_i^2}{12} + \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le r} \\left(\\frac{x_i}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{x_j}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{12}\\sum_{i=1}^r x_i^2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le r} x_i x_j $$\nUsing $\\sum x_i^2 = c_1^2 - 2c_2$ and $\\sum_{i<j} x_i x_j = c_2$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_4 = \\frac{1}{12}(c_1^2 - 2c_2) + \\frac{1}{4}c_2 = \\frac{1}{12}c_1^2 - \\frac{2}{12}c_2 + \\frac{3}{12}c_2 = \\frac{1}{12}(c_1^2 + c_2) $$\nSo, the expansion of the Todd class up to degree $4$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Td}(E) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}c_1 + \\frac{1}{12}(c_1^2 + c_2) + \\dots $$\n\nFinally, we compute the degree-$4$ component of the product $\\mathrm{ch}(E)\\,\\mathrm{Td}(E)$. The degree-$4$ component of the product is:\n$$ [\\mathrm{ch}(E)\\,\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_4 = [\\mathrm{ch}(E)]_0 \\cdot [\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_4 + [\\mathrm{ch}(E)]_2 \\cdot [\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_2 + [\\mathrm{ch}(E)]_4 \\cdot [\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_0 $$\nSubstituting the components we found:\n$$ [\\mathrm{ch}(E)\\,\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_4 = r \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{12}(c_1^2 + c_2)\\right) + c_1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}c_1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}c_1^2 - c_2\\right) \\cdot 1 $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{ch}(E)\\,\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_4 = \\frac{r}{12}c_1^2 + \\frac{r}{12}c_2 + \\frac{1}{2}c_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}c_1^2 - c_2 $$\nNow we collect coefficients for $c_1^2$ and $c_2$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{ch}(E)\\,\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_4 = \\left(\\frac{r}{12} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)c_1^2 + \\left(\\frac{r}{12} - 1\\right)c_2 $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{ch}(E)\\,\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_4 = \\left(\\frac{r}{12} + \\frac{12}{12}\\right)c_1^2 + \\left(\\frac{r}{12} - \\frac{12}{12}\\right)c_2 $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{ch}(E)\\,\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_4 = \\frac{r+12}{12}c_1^2 + \\frac{r-12}{12}c_2 $$\nThis can be written as a single fraction:\n$$ [\\mathrm{ch}(E)\\,\\mathrm{Td}(E)]_4 = \\frac{1}{12}\\left((r+12)c_1^2 + (r-12)c_2\\right) $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}\\left((r+12)c_1^2 + (r-12)c_2\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2970927"}]}
