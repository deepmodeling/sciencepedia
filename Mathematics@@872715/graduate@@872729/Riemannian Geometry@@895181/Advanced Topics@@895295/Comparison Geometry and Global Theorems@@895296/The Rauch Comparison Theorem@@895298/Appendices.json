A standard formulation of the theorem is as follows:\n\nLet $(M_1, g_1)$ and $(M_2, g_2)$ be Riemannian manifolds. Let $\\gamma_1:[0,L] \\to M_1$ and $\\gamma_2:[0,L] \\to M_2$ be unit-speed geodesics. Let $J_1$ and $J_2$ be Jacobi fields along $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ respectively, such that $J_i(0)=0$, $J_i(t)$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}_i(t)$, and $\\|J_1'(0)\\| = \\|J_2'(0)\\|$. If the sectional curvatures $K_1$ and $K_2$ satisfy $K_1(\\sigma_1) \\le K_2(\\sigma_2)$ for all $t \\in [0,L]$ and all $2$-planes $\\sigma_i \\subset T_{\\gamma_i(t)}M_i$, then $\\|J_1(t)\\| \\ge \\|J_2(t)\\|$ for all $t \\in [0,L]$.\n\nThe rigidity part of the theorem states that if $\\|J_1(t_0)\\| = \\|J_2(t_0)\\|$ for some $t_0 \\in (0,L]$, then the equality $\\|J_1(t)\\| = \\|J_2(t)\\|$ must hold for all $t \\in [0,t_0]$, and the sectional curvatures $K_1(\\Pi_t)$ and $K_2(\\Pi_t)$ must be equal for all $2$-planes $\\Pi_t$ containing $\\dot{\\gamma}_i(t)$ and spanned by parallel-transported vectors corresponding to $J_i'(0)$. For spaces of constant curvature, this implies $k_1=k_2$.\n\nNow, let us analyze the given problem in light of this theorem.\n1.  **Why single-point equality does not imply $k_{1}=k_{2}$:**\n    The curvatures are given as $k_{1}=1$ and $k_{2}=4$, so $k_{1}  k_{2}$. The Rauch comparison theorem in its standard form (as stated above) would compare a manifold with curvature less than or equal to another. To align with this, we can think of comparing $\\mathbb{M}_{k_{1}}$ (lower curvature) with $\\mathbb{M}_{k_{2}}$ (higher curvature).\n    The crucial premise of the Rauch theorem (and its rigidity statement) is that the initial conditions on the Jacobi fields are matched, specifically $\\|J_{1}'(0)\\| = \\|J_{2}'(0)\\|$, which means $v_{1}=v_{2}$.\n    In this problem, we have explicitly shown that to achieve $\\|J_{1}(t_{0})\\|=\\|J_{2}(t_{0})\\|$ with $k_{1} \\neq k_{2}$, we must have $v_{2} = v_{1}\\sec(t_{0})$. Since $t_{0} \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, $\\sec(t_{0})  1$, which implies $v_{2}  v_{1}$.\n    Therefore, the condition $\\|J_{1}'(0)\\| = \\|J_{2}'(0)\\|$ is violated. We have engineered the equality of norms at a single point $t_{0}$ precisely by setting different initial derivative norms. The higher curvature of $\\mathbb{M}_{k_{2}}$ has a stronger focusing effect on geodesics, which would naturally make $\\|J_{2}(t)\\|$ smaller than $\\|J_{1}(t)\\|$ if $v_{1}=v_{2}$. To counteract this, we gave $J_{2}$ a larger initial \"velocity\" ($v_{2}v_{1}$), allowing its norm to \"catch up\" to the norm of $J_{1}$ at the specific time $t_{0}$.\n    The problem itself is a constructed counterexample: we have $k_{1} \\neq k_{2}$ and $\\|J_{1}(t_{0})\\|=\\|J_{2}(t_{0})\\|$, which is possible because we did not satisfy all the hypotheses required for the rigidity conclusion of the Rauch theorem.\n\n2.  **Additional hypotheses for rigidity:**\n    Based on the discussion above, for the conclusion of rigidity (i.e., $k_{1}=k_{2}$) to follow from an equality of Jacobi field norms, the following additional hypotheses are necessary:\n    a) **Equality of Initial Conditions:** The initial derivative norms must be equal: $\\|J_{1}'(0)\\| = \\|J_{2}'(0)\\|$, i.e., $v_{1} = v_{2}$. This is the fundamental starting point for a fair comparison.\n    b) **Equality over an Interval:** The equality of norms, $\\|J_{1}(t)\\|=\\|J_{2}(t)\\|$, must hold not just at a single isolated time $t_{0}0$, but for all $t$ in a continuous interval, e.g., $t \\in [0, L]$ for some $L0$ (where $L$ is less than the first conjugate point distance for both manifolds). Equality at $t=0$ is trivial, so the non-trivial condition is equality for $t \\in (0,L]$.\n\n    If we assume $k_{1} \\le k_{2}$ and both hypotheses (a) and (b) are satisfied, then the rigidity part of the Rauch comparison theorem can be invoked to conclude that $k_{1}=k_{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{v_{1}\\sec(t_{0})}$$", "id": "3036470"}, {"introduction": "With a solid grasp of the model spaces and the theorem's subtleties, we can now apply it to a more realistic geometric problem.

The sectional curvature for a plane spanned by a vector tangent to the radial direction $\\partial/\\partial r$ and a vector tangent to the sphere is given by the standard formula $K_r(r) = -f''(r)/f(r)$. A radial geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ from the pole with unit speed is parameterized by arc length $t$, so $r(t)=t$. The tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\partial/\\partial r$. The Jacobi equation along a geodesic $\\gamma$ is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. For a normal Jacobi field $J(t)$, its length $y(t) = |J(t)|$ simplifies to $y''(t) + K(\\sigma(t))y(t) = 0$, where $K(\\sigma(t))$ is the sectional curvature of the plane $\\sigma(t)$ spanned by $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. In our case, this is the radial sectional curvature $K_r(t)$. Thus, the scalar normal Jacobi equation is $y''(t) + K_r(t)y(t)=0$.\n\nNext, we solve this ODE for the given warping function $f(r) = r - ar^3$ and initial conditions $y(0)=0, y'(0)=1$.\nFor a rotationally symmetric manifold, a normal Jacobi field vanishing at the pole $t=0$ has scalar part $y(t)$ given by $y(t) = f(t)$. Let's verify this. We need to check if $y(t)=f(t)$ satisfies the ODE and the initial conditions.\nThe ODE is $y'' + K_r(t)y = 0$, which is $y'' - \\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)} y = 0$.\nIf we substitute $y(t)=f(t)$, we get $f''(t) - \\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)}f(t) = f''(t) - f''(t) = 0$. So $y(t)=f(t)$ is a solution.\nNow we check the initial conditions.\nFrom the problem statement $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$.\nSo, $y(0) = f(0) = 0$, and $y'(0) = f'(0) = 1$. Both initial conditions are satisfied.\nTherefore, the solution to the Jacobi equation with the specified initial conditions is simply the warping function evaluated at $r=t$.\nFor $f(r) = r(1-ar^2)$, the solution is $y(t) = f(t) = t(1-at^2) = t - at^3$.\n\nThe conjugate radius $t_c$ is the first positive time $t0$ where the Jacobi field vanishes, i.e., $y(t_c)=0$.\nWe solve $y(t) = t(1-at^2) = 0$.\nThe solutions are $t=0$ and $1-at^2=0$.\n$1-at^2=0$ implies $t^2 = 1/a$. Since $t$ must be positive, we take the positive root.\nThe first positive zero is $t_c = 1/\\sqrt{a}$.\n\nFinally, we apply the Rauch comparison theorem.\nFirst, we compute the radial sectional curvature $K_r(t)$ for our manifold.\n$f(t) = t - at^3$.\n$f'(t) = 1 - 3at^2$.\n$f''(t) = -6at$.\n$K_r(t) = -\\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)} = -\\frac{-6at}{t - at^3} = \\frac{6at}{t(1-at^2)} = \\frac{6a}{1-at^2}$.\nWe are to compare this to a model space $(\\tilde{M}, \\tilde{g})$ of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa = 6a$.\nFor $t \\in (0, t_c) = (0, 1/\\sqrt{a})$, we have $0  t  1/\\sqrt{a}$, which implies $0  t^2  1/a$, so $0  at^2  1$.\nThis gives $0  1 - at^2  1$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{1}{1-at^2}  1$.\nSince $a0$, we have $K_r(t) = 6a \\left(\\frac{1}{1-at^2}\\right)  6a = \\kappa$.\nSo, the sectional curvature of our manifold $M$ is strictly greater than the curvature of the comparison space $\\tilde{M}$ for all $t \\in (0, t_c)$.\n\nThe Rauch comparison theorem states that if $K_M \\ge K_{\\tilde{M}}$, then the first conjugate point in $M$ occurs no later than the first conjugate point in $\\tilde{M}$. That is, $t_c \\le \\tilde{t}_c$.\nLet's find the conjugate radius $\\tilde{t}_c$ for the constant curvature space. The scalar Jacobi equation is $\\tilde{y}''(t) + \\kappa \\tilde{y}(t) = 0$, which is $\\tilde{y}''(t) + 6a \\tilde{y}(t) = 0$.\nThe general solution is $\\tilde{y}(t) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{6a}t) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{6a}t)$.\nThe initial conditions are $\\tilde{y}(0)=0$ and $\\tilde{y}'(0)=1$.\n$\\tilde{y}(0) = A = 0$.\n$\\tilde{y}'(t) = B\\sqrt{6a}\\cos(\\sqrt{6a}t)$.\n$\\tilde{y}'(0) = B\\sqrt{6a} = 1 \\implies B = 1/\\sqrt{6a}$.\nSo, $\\tilde{y}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6a}}\\sin(\\sqrt{6a}t)$.\nThe first positive conjugate point $\\tilde{t}_c$ occurs at the first positive zero of $\\tilde{y}(t)$. We must have $\\sin(\\sqrt{6a}\\tilde{t}_c) = 0$, which means $\\sqrt{6a}\\tilde{t}_c = \\pi$.\nThis gives $\\tilde{t}_c = \\pi/\\sqrt{6a}$.\n\nThe Rauch theorem predicts $t_c \\le \\tilde{t}_c$, which is $1/\\sqrt{a} \\le \\pi/\\sqrt{6a}$.\nThis inequality simplifies to $1 \\le \\pi/\\sqrt{6}$, or $\\sqrt{6} \\le \\pi$.\nSquaring both sides gives $6 \\le \\pi^2$. Since $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$, so the inequality $6 \\le \\pi^2$ is true. This confirms the theorem's application.\nThe interpretation of this inequality is that a region of higher curvature focuses geodesics more strongly. Since $K_r(t)  \\kappa$, our manifold is more curved along the geodesic path than the comparison space. This stronger focusing causes geodesics emanating from the pole to reconverge faster, leading to a smaller conjugate radius ($t_c  \\tilde{t}_c$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}}$$", "id": "3036482"}]}
