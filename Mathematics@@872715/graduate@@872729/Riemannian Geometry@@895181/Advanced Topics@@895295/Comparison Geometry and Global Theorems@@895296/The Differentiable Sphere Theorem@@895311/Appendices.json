The sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)$ of a real two-dimensional plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p\\mathbb{C}P^n$ spanned by an orthonormal pair of vectors $\\{u, v\\}$ is defined as $K(\\sigma) = R(u,v,v,u)$, where $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. The problem provides the formula for the curvature tensor of a complex space form with constant holomorphic sectional curvature $c$:\n$$R(X,Y,Z,W) = \\frac{c}{4}\\Big( \\langle X,W\\rangle \\langle Y,Z\\rangle - \\langle X,Z\\rangle \\langle Y,W\\rangle + \\langle JX,W\\rangle \\langle JY,Z\\rangle - \\langle JX,Z\\rangle \\langle JY,W\\rangle - 2\\,\\langle JX,Y\\rangle \\langle JZ,W\\rangle \\Big)$$\nTo find $K(\\sigma)$, we substitute $X=u$, $Y=v$, $Z=v$, and $W=u$ into this formula:\n$$K(\\sigma) = R(u,v,v,u) = \\frac{c}{4}\\Big( \\langle u,u\\rangle \\langle v,v\\rangle - \\langle u,v\\rangle \\langle v,u\\rangle + \\langle Ju,u\\rangle \\langle Jv,v\\rangle - \\langle Ju,v\\rangle \\langle Jv,u\\rangle - 2\\,\\langle Ju,v\\rangle \\langle Jv,u\\rangle \\Big)$$\nWe simplify this expression using the properties of the orthonormal basis $\\{u,v\\}$ and the complex structure $J$.\nSince $\\{u,v\\}$ is an orthonormal pair, we have:\n$\\langle u,u \\rangle = 1$\n$\\langle v,v \\rangle = 1$\n$\\langle u,v \\rangle = 0$\n\nThe complex structure $J$ is part of a Kähler structure, which implies it is an isometry, i.e., $\\langle JX, JY \\rangle = \\langle X, Y \\rangle$ for any vectors $X, Y$. It also satisfies $J^2 = -I$. This leads to the property of skew-symmetry with respect to the metric $g = \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$:\n$\\langle JX, Y \\rangle = \\langle JX, -J^2Y \\rangle = \\langle JX, -J(JY) \\rangle$. Using the isometry property with $X \\to X$ and $Y \\to JY$, we get $\\langle JX, J(JY) \\rangle = \\langle X, JY \\rangle$. Thus, $\\langle JX, Y \\rangle = - \\langle X, JY \\rangle$.\nA direct consequence of skew-symmetry is that for any vector $X$, $\\langle JX, X \\rangle = 0$.\n\nApplying these properties to the terms in the expression for $K(\\sigma)$:\n$\\langle Ju,u \\rangle = 0$\n$\\langle Jv,v \\rangle = 0$\nLet $a = \\langle Ju, v\\rangle$, as defined in the problem.

This requires determining the range of possible values for $a^2$. The quantity $a$ is defined as $a = \\langle Ju, v \\rangle$. Since $\\{u, v\\}$ are tangent vectors, we can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n$$|a| = |\\langle Ju, v \\rangle| \\le \\|Ju\\| \\|v\\|$$\nSince $u$ and $v$ are unit vectors, $\\|u\\|=1$ and $\\|v\\|=1$. The complex structure $J$ is an isometry, so $\\|Ju\\| = \\|u\\| = 1$.\nTherefore, $|a| \\le (1)(1) = 1$, which implies $0 \\le a^2 \\le 1$.\n\nThe two extremal values of $a^2$ are attainable.\nThe value $a^2=1$ (i.e., $a = \\pm 1$) occurs when $v$ is parallel to $Ju$. Since both are unit vectors, this means $v = \\pm Ju$. The plane $\\sigma = \\text{span}\\{u, v\\}$ is then $\\text{span}\\{u, Ju\\}$, which is a $J$-invariant plane, also known as a holomorphic plane. The sectional curvature of such a plane is precisely the holomorphic sectional curvature.\nThe value $a^2=0$ (i.e., $a=0$) occurs when $v$ is orthogonal to $Ju$. This is possible provided the dimension of the tangent space is large enough. The vectors $\\{u, Ju\\}$ form an orthonormal pair. If the real dimension of the tangent space $2n \\ge 4$ (i.e., $n \\ge 2$), the orthogonal complement of $\\text{span}\\{u, Ju\\}$ is non-trivial, so we can choose a unit vector $v$ in this complement. Such a choice gives $\\langle u, v \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle Ju, v \\rangle = 0$. The plane $\\sigma = \\text{span}\\{u, v\\}$ is then a totally real plane.\n\nThe expression $K(\\sigma) = \\frac{c}{4}(1 + 3a^2)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $a^2$. Thus, its minimum and maximum values are attained at the bounds of the interval for $a^2$, which is $[0, 1]$.\nThe minimum sectional curvature $K_{\\min}$ occurs at $a^2=0$:\n$$K_{\\min} = \\frac{c}{4}(1 + 3(0)) = \\frac{c}{4}$$\nThe maximum sectional curvature $K_{\\max}$ occurs at $a^2=1$:\n$$K_{\\max} = \\frac{c}{4}(1 + 3(1)) = \\frac{c}{4}(4) = c$$\nThe range of sectional curvatures for a complex space form with positive holomorphic sectional curvature $c$ is $[\\frac{c}{4}, c]$.\n\nThird, we specialize to the case of $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ with the given normalization, where the constant holomorphic sectional curvature $c=4$.\nSubstituting $c=4$ into our expressions for $K_{\\min}$ and $K_{\\max}$:\n$$K_{\\min} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$$\n$$K_{\\max} = 4$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{K_{\\min}}{K_{\\max}}$.\n$$\\frac{K_{\\min}}{K_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThis ratio is a well-known characteristic of $\\mathbb{C}P^n$, often referred to as the $\\frac{1}{4}$-pinching of its sectional curvatures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "2994701"}, {"introduction": "To fully appreciate the power of a theorem, it is essential to understand why its hypotheses are necessary.

This property means that for ANY orthonormal $4$-frame at any point, the isotropic curvature values (which are certain linear combinations of curvature components, like the one in Part 1) are all non-negative. Our calculation of $I=0$ for a particularly chosen frame is consistent with this fact, and shows that the isotropic curvature is not strictly positive.\n\nNow, we analyze the sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)$ of $M$, where $\\sigma$ is a $2$-dimensional plane in a tangent space $T_pM$. Let $\\{u, v\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $\\sigma$. We can decompose these vectors along the factors: $u = u_1+u_2$ and $v = v_1+v_2$, where $u_1, v_1 \\in T_{p_1}S^2(r)$ and $u_2, v_2 \\in T_{p_2}S^2(r)$. The sectional curvature is given by:\n$$\nK(\\sigma) = \\langle R(u, v)v, u \\rangle = \\langle R(u_1+u_2, v_1+v_2)(v_1+v_2), u_1+u_2 \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the bilinearity of $R$ and the properties of product manifolds, this simplifies to:\n$$\nK(\\sigma) = \\langle R(u_1, v_1)v_1, u_1 \\rangle + \\langle R(u_2, v_2)v_2, u_2 \\rangle\n$$\nThe terms on the right are the sectional curvatures spanned by the projected vectors in each factor. For a space of constant curvature $\\kappa = 1/r^2$, $\\langle R(X,Y)Y,X \\rangle = \\kappa (\\|X\\|^2 \\|Y\\|^2 - \\langle X,Y \\rangle^2)$.\nThus,\n$$\nK(\\sigma) = \\kappa (\\|u_1\\|^2 \\|v_1\\|^2 - \\langle u_1, v_1 \\rangle^2) + \\kappa (\\|u_2\\|^2 \\|v_2\\|^2 - \\langle u_2, v_2 \\rangle^2)\n$$\nThis can be written using the wedge product norm as $K(\\sigma) = \\kappa (\\|u_1 \\wedge v_1\\|^2 + \\|u_2 \\wedge v_2\\|^2)$.\nSince $\\kappa>0$, all sectional curvatures are non-negative, $K(\\sigma) \\ge 0$.\n\nLet's find the range of $K(\\sigma)$:\n-   **Maximum Curvature**: If the plane $\\sigma$ is contained entirely within one of the factors, for instance $\\sigma \\subset T_{p_1}S^2(r)$, we can choose $u=e_1, v=e_2$. Then $u_1=e_1, u_2=0, v_1=e_2, v_2=0$. In this case, $K(\\sigma) = \\langle R^1(e_1, e_2)e_2, e_1 \\rangle = \\kappa = 1/r^2$. This is the maximum possible value.\n-   **Minimum Curvature**: If the plane $\\sigma$ is a \"mixed plane\", spanned by one vector from each factor, e.g., $u=e_1, v=e_3$. Then $u_1=e_1, u_2=0, v_1=0, v_2=e_3$. The formula gives $K(\\sigma) = \\kappa (\\|e_1 \\wedge 0\\|^2 + \\|0 \\wedge e_3\\|^2) = 0$.\n\nThe range of sectional curvatures on $M$ is $[0, 1/r^2]$.\nA manifold is said to have strictly $\\delta$-pinched positive sectional curvature if at every point, the sectional curvatures $K$ satisfy $\\delta K_{\\text{max}} < K \\le K_{\\text{max}}$ for some $\\delta > 0$. Since the minimum sectional curvature of $M$ is $0$, the pinching constant is $\\delta = K_{\\text{min}}/K_{\\text{max}} = 0$. This is not strictly positive, so the manifold's curvature is not strictly pinched.\n\n**Part 3: Relation to the Differentiable Sphere Theorem**\n\nThe Differentiable Sphere Theorem states that a complete, simply connected $n$-manifold ($n \\ge 2$) with strictly $\\frac{1}{4}$-pinched positive sectional curvature is homeomorphic to $S^n$. The modern diffeomorphism version requires $n \\geq 4$ and can drop the simply connected assumption for even $n$ if the pinching is strong enough, but the core curvature condition is strict pinching.\nThe problem provides a simplified statement: \"a compact $n$-manifold $M^{n}$, $n \\geq 4$, with pointwise strictly $\\frac{1}{4}$-pinched positive sectional curvature is diffeomorphic to the standard sphere $S^{n}$.\"\n\nOur manifold $M = S^2(r) \\times S^2(r)$ is compact and has dimension $n=4$. However, as shown in Part 2, its sectional curvatures range from $0$ to $1/r^2$. The pinching constant is $\\delta=0$. The condition for the sphere theorem is $\\delta > 1/4$. Since $0 \\ngtr 1/4$, the hypothesis of the theorem is not satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the theorem (that $M$ is diffeomorphic to $S^4$) does not apply. This is consistent with the known topology of $M$. For example, their homology groups differ significantly. By the Künneth formula, the second homology group of the product is $H_2(S^2 \\times S^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_2(S^2)\\otimes H_0(S^2) \\oplus H_0(S^2)\\otimes H_2(S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$, whereas for the sphere $H_2(S^4; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Thus, $S^2 \\times S^2$ is not even homotopy equivalent, let alone diffeomorphic, to $S^4$.\n\nIn summary, the manifold $S^2(r) \\times S^2(r)$ serves as a critical example that lies on the boundary of the conditions of the sphere theorem.

The linear transformation defined by $\\gamma^k$ is unitary, because:\n    $$ \\langle \\gamma^{k} u, \\gamma^{k} v \\rangle = (\\omega_{1}^{k} u_{1})\\overline{(\\omega_{1}^{k} v_{1})} + (\\omega_{q}^{k} u_{2})\\overline{(\\omega_{q}^{k} v_{2})} = |\\omega_{1}^{k}|^{2}u_{1}\\bar{v}_{1} + |\\omega_{q}^{k}|^{2}u_{2}\\bar{v}_{2} = u_{1}\\bar{v}_{1} + u_{2}\\bar{v}_{2} = \\langle u, v \\rangle $$\n    A unitary transformation preserves the norm and hence distances in $\\mathbb{C}^{2}$. Since $\\gamma^k$ is an isometry of the ambient space $\\mathbb{C}^{2}$ and it maps $\\mathbb{S}^{3}$ to itself, its restriction to $\\mathbb{S}^{3}$ is an isometry of $(\\mathbb{S}^{3}, g_{\\text{round}})$.\n\n3.  **The action is free.**\n    An action is free if the only group element that fixes any point is the identity element. The identity element in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is $k=0 \\pmod p$. We need to show that if $\\gamma^k \\cdot z = z$ for some $z \\in \\mathbb{S}^3$ and $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, p-1\\}$, then we have a contradiction.\n    The condition $\\gamma^k \\cdot (z_1, z_2) = (z_1, z_2)$ means:\n    $$ \\omega_{1}^{k} z_{1} = z_{1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\omega_{q}^{k} z_{2} = z_{2} $$\n    This is equivalent to:\n    $$ (\\exp(2\\pi i k/p) - 1)z_1 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (\\exp(2\\pi i k q/p) - 1)z_2 = 0 $$\n    For $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, p-1\\}$, the term $k/p$ is not an integer, so $\\exp(2\\pi i k/p) \\neq 1$. Therefore, the first equation implies $z_1 = 0$.\n    For the second equation, $\\exp(2\\pi i k q/p) = 1$ if and only if $kq/p$ is an integer. Since $\\gcd(p,q)=1$, this would imply that $p$ divides $k$. However, $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, p-1\\}$, so $p$ cannot divide $k$. Thus, $\\exp(2\\pi i k q/p) \\neq 1$, and the second equation implies $z_2 = 0$.\n    The only fixed point is $(z_1, z_2) = (0,0)$. But this point is not on the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{3}$, since $|0|^2 + |0|^2 = 0 \\neq 1$. Therefore, no point on $\\mathbb{S}^{3}$ is fixed by any non-identity element of the group. The action is free.\n\nSince the action of the finite group $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is smooth, free, and by isometries on the manifold $\\mathbb{S}^3$, a standard result in differential geometry (the Quotient Manifold Theorem) asserts that the orbit space $L(p,q) = \\mathbb{S}^{3}/\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a smooth manifold. Furthermore, there is a unique Riemannian metric on $L(p,q)$ such that the quotient map $\\pi: \\mathbb{S}^{3} \\to L(p,q)$ is a Riemannian submersion. Because the fibers (the orbits of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$) are discrete, $\\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism, and since the action is by isometries, it is a local isometry. Such a map is known as a Riemannian covering.\n\nNow, we determine the scalar curvature $R$ of $L(p,q)$.\nA fundamental property of a Riemannian covering map $\\pi: M \\to N$ is that it is a local isometry. This means that for any point $y \\in N$ and any point $x \\in \\pi^{-1}(y)$, the differential $d\\pi_x: T_x M \\to T_y N$ is a linear isometry between the tangent spaces. As a consequence, all local, intrinsic geometric quantities are preserved. This includes the Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci tensor, and the scalar curvature.\nTherefore, the scalar curvature of the lens space $L(p,q)$ at any point is equal to the scalar curvature of the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{3}$ at any point. Since $\\mathbb{S}^{3}$ is a homogeneous space, its scalar curvature is constant.\n\nWe now compute the scalar curvature of the unit $3$-sphere, $\\mathbb{S}^{3}$. The unit $n$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$ embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is a space of constant sectional curvature $K=1$. For a manifold of dimension $n$ with constant sectional curvature $K$, the scalar curvature $R$ is given by the formula:\n$$ R = n(n-1)K $$\nFor the unit $3$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{3}$, we have dimension $n=3$ and constant sectional curvature $K=1$. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n$$ R_{\\mathbb{S}^{3}} = 3(3-1)(1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6 $$\nSince the scalar curvature of $L(p,q)$ is the same as that of $\\mathbb{S}^{3}$, we have:\n$$ R_{L(p,q)} = 6 $$\nNote that the scalar curvature is independent of the parameters $p$ and $q$, which determine the global topology of the lens space but not its local Riemannian geometry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2994675"}]}
