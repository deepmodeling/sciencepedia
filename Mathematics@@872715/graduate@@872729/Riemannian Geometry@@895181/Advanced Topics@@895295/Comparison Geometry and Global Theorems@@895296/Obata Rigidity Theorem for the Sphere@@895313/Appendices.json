The metric is given by $g_{c} = c^{2} g_{\\mathrm{can}}$, where $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ is the standard metric on the unit sphere $S^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and $c  0$ is a constant. The computation is to be performed by analyzing the function $f(x) = x_{n+1}$ and the Hessian equation it satisfies.\n\nFirst, let us establish the relationship between the geometric quantities associated with the metrics $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and $g_{c}$. Let $\\nabla$ and $\\nabla^{c}$ be the Levi-Civita connections corresponding to $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and $g_{c}$, respectively. For any vector fields $X, Y, Z$ on $S^{n}$, Koszul's formula for $\\nabla^{c}$ is:\n$$2g_{c}(\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y, Z) = X(g_{c}(Y,Z)) + Y(g_{c}(X,Z)) - Z(g_{c}(X,Y)) + g_{c}([X,Y],Z) - g_{c}([X,Z],Y) - g_{c}([Y,Z],X)$$\nSubstituting $g_{c} = c^{2} g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and noting that $c$ is a constant, we have:\n$$2c^{2}g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y, Z) = c^{2} \\left[ X(g_{\\mathrm{can}}(Y,Z)) + \\dots \\right] = c^{2} \\left[ 2g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z) \\right]$$\nThis implies $g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y, Z) = g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z)$. Since this holds for any vector field $Z$, we conclude that the Levi-Civita connection is invariant under constant scaling of the metric:\n$$\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y = \\nabla_{X}Y$$\n\nNext, we compute the Hessian of the function $f(x) = x_{n+1}$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$. Let $\\tilde{f}: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be the linear function $\\tilde{f}(x) = x_{n+1}$ whose restriction to $S^{n}$ is $f$. Let $D$ denote the flat connection on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The gradient of $\\tilde{f}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is the constant vector field $D\\tilde{f} = E_{n+1} = (0, \\dots, 0, 1)$.\n\nThe gradient of $f$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$, denoted $\\mathrm{grad}_{g_{\\mathrm{can}}} f$, is the tangential projection of $D\\tilde{f}$ onto the tangent spaces of $S^{n}$. At a point $p \\in S^{n}$, the outward unit normal vector is $N(p) = p$. The tangential projection of a vector $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is $V^{\\top} = V - g_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}(V, N)N$. Thus,\n$$\\mathrm{grad}_{g_{\\mathrm{can}}} f (p) = (E_{n+1})^{\\top} = E_{n+1} - g_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}(E_{n+1}, p) p = E_{n+1} - p_{n+1} p$$\nSince $f(p) = p_{n+1}$, we can write this vector field as $G(p) = E_{n+1} - f(p)N(p)$.\n\nThe Hessian tensor $\\nabla^{2}f$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$ is given by $(\\nabla^{2}f)(X,Y) = g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla_{X}(\\mathrm{grad}_{g_{\\mathrm{can}}}f), Y)$. The covariant derivative $\\nabla_{X}G$ is the tangential projection of the ambient derivative $D_{X}G$:\n$$\\nabla_{X}G = (D_{X}G)^{\\top} = (D_{X}(E_{n+1} - fN))^{\\top}$$\nWe compute the ambient derivative term by term for a tangent vector field $X$:\n$$D_{X}(E_{n+1} - fN) = D_{X}E_{n+1} - D_{X}(fN)$$\nSince $E_{n+1}$ is a constant vector field, $D_{X}E_{n+1} = 0$. Using the product rule for $D_{X}(fN)$:\n$$D_{X}(fN) = (Xf)N + f(D_{X}N)$$\nFor the unit sphere $S^{n}$, the shape operator $S(X) = -D_{X}N$ is given by $S(X)= -X$ (with the choice of outward normal $N(p)=p$, we have $D_X N = D_X p = X$, so $S(X)=-X$). The second fundamental form is $\\mathrm{II}(X,Y) = g_{\\mathrm{can}}(S(X),Y) = -g_{\\mathrm{can}}(X,Y)$. From $S(X) = -D_X N$, we have $D_X N = X$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $D_X(fN)$:\n$$D_{X}(fN) = (Xf)N + fX$$\nTherefore, $D_{X}G = -((Xf)N + fX)$. Taking the tangential projection:\n$$\\nabla_{X}G = (- (Xf)N - fX)^{\\top} = -fX$$\nsince $X$ is tangent and $N$ is normal.\nThe Hessian of $f$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$ is then:\n$$(\\nabla^{2}f)(X,Y) = g_{\\mathrm{can}}(-fX, Y) = -f g_{\\mathrm{can}}(X,Y)$$\nThis means the Hessian tensor is $\\nabla^{2}f = -f g_{\\mathrm{can}}$.\n\nNow we consider the Hessian $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f$ with respect to the metric $g_{c}$. The Hessian as a bilinear form is defined by $(\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f)(X,Y) = X(Y(f)) - (\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y)(f)$. Since $\\nabla^{c} = \\nabla$, we have:\n$$(\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f)(X,Y) = X(Y(f)) - (\\nabla_{X}Y)(f) = (\\nabla^{2}f)(X,Y)$$\nSo, the Hessian tensor is unchanged: $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f = \\nabla^{2}f = -f g_{\\mathrm{can}}$.\n\nThe problem asks to find the constant $k$ such that $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f + kfg_{c} = 0$. We substitute our result for $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f$:\n$$-f g_{\\mathrm{can}} + kfg_{c} = 0$$\nUsing the relation $g_{c} = c^{2}g_{\\mathrm{can}}$, we get:\n$$-f g_{\\mathrm{can}} + kf(c^{2}g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = 0$$\n$$f(-1 + kc^{2})g_{\\mathrm{can}} = 0$$\nSince this equation must hold for all points on $S^{n}$, and $f$ is not identically zero, the term in the parenthesis must be zero:\n$$-1 + kc^{2} = 0 \\implies k = \\frac{1}{c^{2}}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta_{g_{c}}f$. This operator is defined as the trace of the Hessian with respect to the metric $g_{c}$:\n$$\\Delta_{g_{c}}f = \\mathrm{tr}_{g_{c}}(\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f)$$\nUsing the Hessian equation $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f = -kfg_{c} = -\\frac{1}{c^{2}}fg_{c}$, we find:\n$$\\Delta_{g_{c}}f = \\mathrm{tr}_{g_{c}}\\left(-\\frac{1}{c^{2}}fg_{c}\\right) = -\\frac{f}{c^{2}} \\mathrm{tr}_{g_{c}}(g_{c})$$\nThe trace of the metric tensor on an $n$-dimensional manifold is the dimension $n$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{tr}_{g_{c}}(g_{c}) = n$.\nThe Laplacian of $f$ is thus:\n$$\\Delta_{g_{c}}f = -\\frac{n}{c^{2}}f$$\nThe eigenvalue equation for the Laplacian is conventionally written as $\\Delta \\phi = -\\lambda \\phi$. Comparing this with our result, we identify the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ associated with the eigenfunction $f$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{n}{c^{2}}$$\nThe function $f(x)=x_{n+1}$ is a coordinate function restricted to the sphere, which is a spherical harmonic of degree $1$. It is a classical result that such functions are eigenfunctions corresponding to the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian on the sphere.

Provide a single exact value with no rounding.", "solution": "The problem asks for the supremum of the diameters of $n$-spheres of radius $r$ under a specific Ricci curvature constraint. We proceed by following the outlined steps.\n\nFirst, we determine the sectional and Ricci curvatures of the sphere $\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$. The $n$-dimensional sphere of radius $r$ is a canonical example of a space of constant sectional curvature. The standard unit sphere, denoted $(S^n_1, g_1)$, has constant sectional curvature $K_1 = 1$. The metric $g_r$ of a sphere of radius $r$ is related to the metric $g_1$ of the unit sphere by a scaling factor of $r^2$, i.e., $g_r = r^2 g_1$. The sectional curvature $K$ scales inversely with the square of the scaling factor of the metric. Thus, the sectional curvature of $\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$ is given by\n$$K = \\frac{1}{r^2}$$\nUsing the provided Fact (i), for a space of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$ is given by $\\operatorname{Ric}=(n-1)K\\,g$. For $\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$, this becomes:\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{r}} = (n-1)K g_r = (n-1)\\frac{1}{r^2} g_r$$\n\nSecond, we compute the diameter of $\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$. According to Fact (ii), geodesics on a sphere are great circles. The diameter of a Riemannian manifold, $\\operatorname{diam}(M,g)$, is defined as the supremum of the geodesic distance $d_g(x,y)$ over all pairs of points $x,y \\in M$. On a sphere, the maximum distance occurs between a point and its antipodal point. The length of a great circle on a sphere of radius $r$ is $2\\pi r$. The distance between antipodal points is half of this length. Therefore, the diameter of $\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$ is:\n$$\\operatorname{diam}\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\pi r) = \\pi r$$\n\nThird, we impose the pointwise tensor inequality $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{r}}\\ge (n-1)g_{r}$ to determine the allowed range for the radius $r$. Substituting the expression for $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{r}}$, we have:\n$$(n-1)\\frac{1}{r^2} g_r \\ge (n-1)g_r$$\nFor a non-degenerate sphere, we assume $n \\ge 2$, so $(n-1)  0$. We can divide by this positive scalar factor without changing the inequality:\n$$\\frac{1}{r^2} g_r \\ge g_r$$\nThis tensor inequality holds if and only if the corresponding scalar inequality $\\frac{1}{r^2} \\ge 1$ holds. Since the problem specifies $r0$, we can rearrange this to $1 \\ge r^2$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $1 \\ge |r|$. As $r$ is a positive radius, the allowed range is $0  r \\le 1$.\n\nWe are now tasked with finding the supremum of the set of diameters for spheres satisfying this condition:\n$$S = \\sup\\left\\{\\operatorname{diam}\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right): r0,\\ \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{r}}\\ge (n-1)g_{r}\\right\\}$$\nUsing our results, this set is equivalent to:\n$$S = \\sup\\left\\{\\pi r: r \\in (0, 1]\\right\\}$$\nThe function $f(r) = \\pi r$ is a strictly increasing function of $r$. The supremum of $f(r)$ on the interval $(0, 1]$ is its value at the rightmost point, $r=1$. Therefore, the supremum is:\n$$S = \\pi \\cdot 1 = \\pi$$\n\nFinally, we briefly explain the connection to the Obata rigidity theorem. The Bonnet–Myers theorem (Fact (iii)) states that for any complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ satisfying $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)g$, its diameter must be less than or equal to $\\pi$. Our analysis shows that within the family of spheres $(S^n_r, g_r)$, this condition restricts the radius to $r \\le 1$, and consequently their diameters $\\pi r$ are all less than or equal to $\\pi$. The maximal diameter $\\pi$ is achieved if and only if $r=1$. This case, $(S^n_1, g_1)$, corresponds to the standard unit sphere, for which we have exact equality: $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_1} = (n-1)g_1$ and $\\operatorname{diam}(S^n_1, g_1) = \\pi$. This demonstrates that the upper bound in the Bonnet-Myers theorem is sharp. The Obata rigidity theorem makes a stronger statement: it asserts that any complete manifold $(M,g)$ satisfying $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)g$ and achieving the maximal diameter $\\operatorname{diam}(M,g)=\\pi$ must be isometric to the standard unit sphere. The sphere is thus \"rigid\" in the sense that it is the unique geometric structure that saturates this diameter bound under the given Ricci curvature constraint. Our calculation provides a concrete illustration of this principle for the family of spherical geometries.\n\nThe exact value of the supremum of the diameters is $\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi}$$", "id": "3036312"}, {"introduction": "A key consequence of the Obata theorem's equality case is not just the geometric identification of the manifold with a sphere, but also a precise characterization of its first eigenspace.

It correctly identifies the map between the space of linear functionals and the eigenspace. It correctly states that the map is a linear isomorphism because it is surjective (by hypothesis) and injective. The justification for injectivity—that a linear functional vanishing on the sphere $S^n$ must be the zero functional—is correct because the sphere spans $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

First, non-zero constant functions are eigenfunctions for the eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = 0$, not the first non-zero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=n$. They belong to the eigenspace $E_0(M)$. The zero linear functional gives rise to the zero function, which belongs to every eigenspace but does not increase the dimension. Second, this leads to an incorrect count of $n+2$. The argument fundamentally confuses the eigenspaces corresponding to different eigenvalues.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Even if injectivity of the restriction map were unavailable, there are at least $n+1$ distinct linear functionals, hence at least $n+1$ distinct eigenfunctions; but the multiplicity could be strictly larger because quadratic polynomials on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ may also restrict to first eigenfunctions on $S^n$.\n\nThis argument is flawed. The existence of $n+1$ distinct eigenfunctions does not imply they are linearly independent, which is required to establish a lower bound on the dimension. More critically, the argument contradicts the premise of the problem by suggesting the multiplicity could be larger. The hypothesis explicitly states that $E_1(M)$ consists *only* of restrictions of linear functionals. Furthermore, the claim that restrictions of quadratic polynomials could be first eigenfunctions is false. On the sphere $S^n$, restrictions of harmonic homogeneous polynomials of degree $k$ are eigenfunctions with eigenvalue $k(n+k-1)$. For $k=2$, the eigenvalue is $2(n+1)$, which is not equal to $n$ for any $n \\ge 1$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. For each $1\\le i \\le n+1$, the coordinate function $x_i$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ restricts to an eigenfunction on $S^n$ solving $\\Delta_{S^n} x_i + n x_i = 0$, and these are linearly independent on $S^n$. Since $F$ is an isometry, their pullbacks give $n+1$ linearly independent first eigenfunctions on $M$. Moreover, by the identification hypothesis, any first eigenfunction lies in the span of restrictions of linear functionals, which is exactly the degree-$1$ spherical harmonics, so there are precisely $n+1$ degrees of freedom.\n\nThis argument is a concrete and correct justification. It first establishes that the multiplicity is at least $n+1$ by constructing $n+1$ linearly independent eigenfunctions. These are the pullbacks via the isometry $F$ of the coordinate functions restricted to $S^n$. The linear independence of these pullbacks follows from the linear independence of the coordinate functions on $S^n$. Then, it correctly uses the given identification to argue that the multiplicity is at most $n+1$, since the entire eigenspace is generated by the space of linear functionals on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, which has dimension $n+1$. Combining the lower bound ($\\dim E_1(M) \\ge n+1$) and the upper bound ($\\dim E_1(M) \\le n+1$) proves that the dimension is exactly $n+1$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. The identification with linear functions only shows that the multiplicity is at most $n+1$, because different linear functionals can agree on $M$; for instance, if $M$ sits in a hyperplane of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ then two distinct linear functionals can coincide on $M$.\n\nThis argument is incorrect. While it correctly notes that the identification implies an upper bound of $n+1$ on the dimension, its reasoning for why the dimension might be smaller is flawed. It claims that the restriction map might not be injective (\"different linear functionals can agree on $M$\"). The example provided to support this claim is that $M$ might sit in a hyperplane. However, under the problem's conditions, $M$ is isometric to the unit sphere $S^n$. The unit sphere $S^n$ does not lie in any hyperplane of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$; it spans the entire space. Therefore, the premise of the example is false in this context. As shown in the analysis for option A, the restriction map is indeed injective. The argument's conclusion is based on a faulty premise.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3036310"}]}
