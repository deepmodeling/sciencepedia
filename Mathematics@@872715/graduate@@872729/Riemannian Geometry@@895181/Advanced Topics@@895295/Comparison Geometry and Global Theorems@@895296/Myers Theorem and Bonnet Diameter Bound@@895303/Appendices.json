For such a manifold, the curvature tensor has a specific form. For any vectors $X, Y, Z$ in a tangent space, the curvature operator is given by:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = \\kappa (g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y)\n$$\nWe apply this formula to the Jacobi equation, setting $X=J$, $Y=\\dot{\\gamma}$, and $Z=\\dot{\\gamma}$:\n$$\nR(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = \\kappa (g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})J - g(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma})\n$$\nThe problem provides two key properties of $\\gamma$ and $J$:\n1.  $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, which means $g(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t)) = 1$ for all $t$.\n2.  $J(t)$ is everywhere normal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, which means $g(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t)) = 0$ for all $t$.\n\nSubstituting these properties into the expression for the curvature term, we get:\n$$\nR(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = \\kappa (1 \\cdot J - 0 \\cdot \\dot{\\gamma}) = \\kappa J\n$$\nThe Jacobi equation thus simplifies significantly to:\n$$\nJ''(t) + \\kappa J(t) = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation for the vector field $J(t)$. To solve it, we introduce a parallel orthonormal frame along the geodesic $\\gamma$. Let $\\{E_1(t), \\dots, E_n(t)\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(t)}M$ such that each $E_i(t)$ is parallel-transported along $\\gamma$. This means $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}E_i(t) = 0$ for all $i$ and $t$. We can choose this frame such that $E_n(t) = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)$.\n\nSince $J(t)$ is normal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, it lies in the subspace spanned by $\\{E_1(t), \\dots, E_{n-1}(t)\\}$.

This is consistent with the problem statement that $J$ is a nontrivial Jacobi field.\n\nThe Jacobi field $J(t)$ is therefore given by:\n$$\nJ(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}t) E_i(t) = \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}t) \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} B_i E_i(t)\n$$\nWe are looking for the smallest positive time $t_1 > 0$ such that $J(t_1) = 0$.\n$$\nJ(t_1) = \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}t_1) \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} B_i E_i(t_1) = 0\n$$\nThe vector sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} B_i E_i(t_1)$ represents the parallel transport of the vector $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} B_i E_i(0)$.

We shall proceed by addressing each part of the problem sequentially.\n\nLet $S^n$ be the $n$-dimensional sphere of radius $r > 0$ embedded in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The sphere is defined as the set of points $\\{p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : |p|^2 = r^2\\}$. The Riemannian metric $g$ on $S^n$ is the one induced by the standard Euclidean dot product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The problem specifies the radius $r = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ for some constant $\\kappa > 0$. We are given that $n \\geq 2$.\n\n**Part 1: Curvature of the Sphere**\n\nWe first determine the curvature of $(S^n, g)$ using the Gauss equation for a hypersurface. Let $i: S^n \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be the inclusion map. The ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is flat, so its Riemann curvature tensor $\\bar{R}$ is identically zero. Let $N$ be the outward-pointing unit normal vector field on $S^n$. At a point $p \\in S^n$, $N_p = p/r$.\n\nThe second fundamental form $II(X,Y)$ can be derived from the relation $II(X,Y) = -g(Y, \\bar{\\nabla}_X N)$, where $\\bar{\\nabla}$ is the covariant derivative in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. For $X \\in T_pS^n$, we compute the derivative of the normal vector:\n$$ \\bar{\\nabla}_X N = \\frac{1}{r} \\bar{\\nabla}_X p = \\frac{1}{r} X $$\nTherefore, the second fundamental form is $II(X,Y) = -g(Y, \\frac{1}{r}X) = -\\frac{1}{r}g(X,Y)$. Depending on the sign convention for the shape operator, $II$ may have the opposite sign, but this does not affect the final Riemann tensor as $II$ appears quadratically.\n\nThe Gauss equation relates the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ of $S^n$ to the second fundamental form $II$:\n$$ R(X,Y,Z,W) = II(X,W)II(Y,Z) - II(X,Z)II(Y,W) $$\nSubstituting our expression for $II$:\n$$ R(X,Y,Z,W) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{r}g(X,W)\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{r}g(Y,Z)\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{r}g(X,Z)\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{r}g(Y,W)\\right) $$\n$$ R(X,Y,Z,W) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left( g(X,W)g(Y,Z) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) \\right) $$\nGiven $r = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$, we have $1/r^2 = \\kappa$. Thus, the Riemann curvature tensor is:\n$$ R(X,Y,Z,W) = \\kappa \\left( g(Y,Z)g(X,W) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) \\right) $$\nFrom this, we can find the $(1,3)$-tensor $R(X,Y)Z$:\n$$ g(R(X,Y)Z, W) = \\kappa \\left( g(Y,Z)g(X,W) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) \\right) = g(\\kappa(g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y), W) $$\nSince this holds for any vector field $W$, we identify:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = \\kappa \\left( g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y \\right) $$\nThis confirms that $S^n$ is a space of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$. Now, we compute the Ricci curvature tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$. Let $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be a local orthonormal frame for the tangent bundle $TS^n$.

Therefore:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\kappa (n \\cdot g(Y,Z) - g(Y,Z)) = (n-1)\\kappa g(Y,Z) $$\nThis holds for all vector fields $Y, Z$, so we have verified that $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)\\kappa g$.\n\n**Part 2: Diameter of the Sphere**\n\nThe geodesics on the round sphere $(S^n,g)$ are its great circles. A great circle is the intersection of the sphere with a $2$-dimensional plane passing through the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\nThe geodesic distance $d(p,q)$ between two points $p, q \\in S^n$ is the length of the shorter arc of the great circle connecting them. If $\\theta$ is the angle (in radians, $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$) between the position vectors $p$ and $q$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, the arc length is given by $d(p,q) = r\\theta$. The angle is given by $\\theta = \\arccos(\\langle p,q \\rangle / r^2)$.\n\nThe diameter of a Riemannian manifold is the supremum of the geodesic distances between all pairs of its points:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(S^n) = \\sup_{p,q \\in S^n} d(p,q) $$\nThe maximum distance occurs when the angle $\\theta$ is maximized, which is $\\theta = \\pi$. This corresponds to pairs of antipodal points, i.e., $q = -p$.\nTherefore, the diameter of the sphere is:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(S^n) = r \\cdot \\pi $$\nSubstituting $r = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$, we find the exact diameter:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(S^n) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} $$\n\n**Part 3: Bonnet–Myers Theorem and Comparison**\n\nThe Bonnet–Myers theorem states that if $(M,g)$ is a complete, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature satisfying $\\mathrm{Ric}(v,v) \\geq (n-1)K g(v,v)$ for all tangent vectors $v$ and for some constant $K > 0$, then $M$ is compact and its diameter is bounded above by $\\pi/\\sqrt{K}$.\n\nFrom Part 1, we established that the Ricci curvature of $(S^n,g)$ is precisely $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)\\kappa g$. This can be written as:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(v,v) = (n-1)\\kappa g(v,v) $$\nThis satisfies the condition of the Bonnet–Myers theorem with the constant $K = \\kappa$. The sphere $S^n$ is complete and compact. The theorem thus provides the following upper bound for its diameter:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(S^n) \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} $$\nComparing this result with the actual diameter calculated in Part 2, we see that the upper bound provided by the Bonnet–Myers theorem is sharp and is achieved by the sphere:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(S^n)_{\\text{actual}} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} = \\operatorname{diam}(S^n)_{\\text{Bonnet-Myers bound}} $$\nThis equality is a hallmark of spaces of constant curvature, which serve as the model spaces in comparison geometry.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nThe final task is to compute the value of the expression $\\kappa \\cdot (\\operatorname{diam}(S^n))^2$. Using the result from Part 2:\n$$ (\\operatorname{diam}(S^n))^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2}{\\kappa} $$\nNow, we multiply by $\\kappa$:\n$$ \\kappa \\cdot (\\operatorname{diam}(S^n))^2 = \\kappa \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^2}{\\kappa} = \\pi^2 $$\nThe value of the expression is $\\pi^2$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\pi^2} $$", "id": "2984947"}, {"introduction": "To fully grasp the power of a theorem, one must understand its limitations and the necessity of its hypotheses.

The first part requires an explanation for why the flat $n$-torus $T^{n}$ does not satisfy the hypothesis of the Bonnet–Myers theorem. The second part requires the computation of its diameter.\n\nPart 1: Validation of the Bonnet–Myers Theorem Hypothesis\n\nThe Bonnet–Myers theorem applies to complete Riemannian manifolds $(M, g)$ of dimension $n$. Its crucial hypothesis is the existence of a strictly positive lower bound on the Ricci curvature. Specifically, it requires that there exists a constant $k > 0$ such that for any tangent vector $v \\in T_p M$ at any point $p \\in M$, the Ricci curvature satisfies $\\text{Ric}(v, v) \\ge (n-1)k \\|v\\|^2$.\n\nThe problem provides the necessary principles to analyze the curvature of the flat $n$-torus $T^{n} = \\mathbb{R}^{n} / \\Lambda$.\n\n1.  The starting point is the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ equipped with the standard Euclidean metric. As stated in the provided principles, the Euclidean metric is flat, which means its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero everywhere. Let $R_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}$ be this tensor; then $R_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\equiv 0$.\n\n2.  The Ricci curvature tensor, $\\text{Ric}$, is obtained by taking a trace of the Riemann curvature tensor. In local coordinates, if $R_{ijkl}$ are the components of the Riemann tensor, the components of the Ricci tensor are given by $\\text{Ric}_{ik} = g^{jl} R_{jikl}$. Since all components of the Riemann tensor on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are zero, all components of its Ricci tensor must also be zero. Thus, $\\text{Ric}_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\equiv 0$.\n\n3.  The torus $T^{n}$ is constructed as the quotient of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by the lattice $\\Lambda$, which acts by isometries (translations). The problem statement notes that a quotient of a Riemannian manifold by a free, properly discontinuous action by isometries inherits a locally isometric structure. This means that the metric on $T^n$ is locally indistinguishable from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Consequently, the Riemann curvature tensor on $T^{n}$, denoted $R_{T^{n}}$, is also identically zero.\n\n4.  Following the same logic as for $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, since the Riemann curvature tensor of $T^{n}$ is zero, its Ricci curvature tensor must also be zero, i.e., $\\text{Ric}_{T^{n}} \\equiv 0$.\n\nThe hypothesis of the Bonnet–Myers theorem requires the existence of a constant $k > 0$ such that the Ricci curvature is bounded below by this positive value. For the flat torus $T^{n}$, the Ricci curvature is exactly $0$. Therefore, for any choice of $k > 0$, the inequality $\\text{Ric}_{T^{n}} \\ge (n-1)k > 0$ is false. The condition is not met, a fact directly following from the flat nature of the manifold.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the Diameter\n\nThe diameter of a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is defined as the supremum of the geodesic distance over all pairs of points in the manifold:\n$$\n\\text{diam}(M) = \\sup_{p, q \\in M} d(p, q)\n$$\nFor the torus $T^{n} = \\mathbb{R}^{n} / \\Lambda$, the points are equivalence classes $[x]$ of points $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The geodesic distance between two points $[x]$ and $[y]$ is given by the infimum of the Euclidean distances between their representatives in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, taken over all possible lattice translations of one of the points. As provided in the problem statement:\n$$\nd_{T^n}([x], [y]) = \\inf_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} d_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(x, y+\\lambda)\n$$\nHere, $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ and $y = (y_1, \\dots, y_n)$ are points in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and $\\Lambda$ is the lattice generated by the vectors $\\{a_1 e_1, \\dots, a_n e_n\\}$. Any lattice vector $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$ can be written as $\\lambda = (k_1 a_1, \\dots, k_n a_n)$ for some integers $k_1, \\dots, k_n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe squared Euclidean distance in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $d_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(x, z)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - z_i)^2$.

This is the shortest distance from the point $(x_i - y_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ to a point in the one-dimensional lattice $a_i \\mathbb{Z} = \\{k_i a_i \\mid k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. This minimum distance is achieved by choosing $k_i a_i$ to be the nearest multiple of $a_i$ to $(x_i - y_i)$. The value of this minimum distance can be found by reducing the difference $(x_i - y_i)$ modulo $a_i$ to the interval $[-a_i/2, a_i/2]$. Let this reduced value be $\\delta_i^{\\prime}$. Then $\\inf_{k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |x_i - y_i - k_i a_i| = |\\delta_i^{\\prime}|$.\n\nTo find the diameter of $T^{n}$, we must find the supremum of $d_{T^n}([x], [y])$ over all pairs of points $[x], [y] \\in T^{n}$. This is equivalent to finding points $x, y$ that maximize the distance expression derived above. The maximization can be performed for each coordinate component independently. For each $i$, we need to maximize the term $\\inf_{k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} (x_i - y_i - k_i a_i)^2$.\n\nThe value $|\\delta_i^{\\prime}|$ lies in the interval $[0, a_i/2]$. The maximum value it can attain is $a_i/2$. This occurs when the difference $(x_i - y_i)$ is exactly halfway between two consecutive multiples of $a_i$, for example, when $x_i - y_i$ is congruent to $a_i/2$ modulo $a_i$.\n\nWe can choose points $[x]$ and $[y]$ in $T^{n}$ such that this condition is met for all coordinates simultaneously. For instance, let $[y]$ be the equivalence class of the origin, $y = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$. Now we choose a point $[x]$ whose representative $x$ maximizes the distance. We can choose $x = (a_1/2, a_2/2, \\dots, a_n/2)$. The difference vector is $x-y = (a_1/2, \\dots, a_n/2)$.\nFor this pair of points, the squared distance on the torus is:\n$$\nd_{T^n}([x], [y])^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\inf_{k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\left| \\frac{a_i}{2} - k_i a_i \\right| \\right)^2\n$$\nFor each $i$, the infimum $\\inf_{k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |\\frac{a_i}{2} - k_i a_i|$ is achieved for $k_i=0$ (or $k_i=1$), yielding a value of $a_i/2$. Therefore, the squared distance is:\n$$\n\\sup_{[x],[y] \\in T^n} d_{T^n}([x], [y])^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{a_i}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2\n$$\nThis represents the squared distance between the \"most distant\" points on the torus. The diameter is the square root of this value.\n$$\n\\text{diam}(T^n) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the diameter of the flat $n$-torus.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}} } $$", "id": "2984968"}]}
