We can represent this path by a function $x(t)$ where $x(t)$ is the coordinate of the point $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. The tangent vector to the curve is $\\dot{\\gamma}_{x_0}(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt}(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}|_{x(t)}$. The vector field is given as $X(x) = x^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$.\n\nThe condition for an integral curve, $\\dot{\\gamma}_{x_0}(t) = X(\\gamma_{x_0}(t))$, translates into the following ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the coordinate function $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2\n$$\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = x_0$. We are asked to consider the case where $x_0  0$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the integral curves $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$**\n\nThe ODE is separable. For $x \\neq 0$, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^2} = dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a generic time $t$, and correspondingly from the initial position $x_0$ to $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{x_0}^{x(t)} \\frac{1}{\\xi^2} d\\xi = \\int_0^t d\\tau\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\xi} \\right]_{x_0}^{x(t)} = \\left[ \\tau \\right]_0^t\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(t)} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{x_0}\\right) = t - 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x_0} - \\frac{1}{x(t)} = t\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{1}{x_0} - t = \\frac{1 - x_0 t}{x_0}\n$$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides gives the solution for the integral curve:\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{x_0}{1 - x_0 t}\n$$\nThis function represents the integral curve $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ in the standard coordinate on $\\mathbb{R}$. The domain of this solution, starting from $t=0$, is the interval where the denominator is non-zero. Since $x_00$, the denominator is positive near $t=0$. The solution is defined until the denominator becomes zero, which occurs at $t = 1/x_0$. Thus, the maximal interval of definition containing $t=0$ is $(-\\infty, 1/x_0)$.\n\n**2. Explanation of Finite-Time Blow-up and Incompleteness**\n\nThe fundamental extension criterion for ODEs on a manifold $M$ states that if a maximal integral curve $\\gamma: (a,b) \\to M$ has $b  \\infty$, then for any compact set $K \\subset M$, the curve $\\gamma(t)$ must eventually leave $K$ as $t \\to b^-$. That is, there exists some $t_K \\in (a,b)$ such that for all $t \\in (t_K, b)$, $\\gamma(t) \\notin K$.\n\nIn our case, the manifold is $M=\\mathbb{R}$. A compact set $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is, by the Heine-Borel theorem, closed and bounded. Therefore, for any compact set $K$, there exists a real number $R0$ such that $K \\subseteq [-R, R]$.\n\nThe forward-time part of the maximal interval of existence for the integral curve $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ is $[0, 1/x_0)$. The right endpoint is finite: $b = 1/x_0$. To show the curve blows up in finite time, we examine its behavior as $t$ approaches $1/x_0$ from below:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to (1/x_0)^-} x(t) = \\lim_{t \\to (1/x_0)^-} \\frac{x_0}{1 - x_0 t}\n$$\nSince $x_0  0$, as $t \\to (1/x_0)^-$, the denominator $(1 - x_0 t)$ approaches $0$ from the positive side. Thus, the limit of $x(t)$ is $+\\infty$.\n\nThis means that for any compact set $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, which is necessarily bounded, the curve $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ will eventually exceed the bounds of $K$. Specifically, for $K \\subseteq [-R, R]$, the curve leaves $K$ when $|x(t)|  R$. Since $x_00$ and $t \\in [0, 1/x_0)$, $x(t)$ is always positive, so we need $x(t)  R$. We solve for $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{x_0}{1 - x_0 t}  R \\implies x_0  R(1 - x_0 t) \\implies x_0  R - R x_0 t \\implies R x_0 t  R - x_0 \\implies t  \\frac{R-x_0}{Rx_0} = \\frac{1}{x_0} - \\frac{1}{R}\n$$\nFor any $R  x_0$, the time $t_K = \\frac{1}{x_0} - \\frac{1}{R}$ is in the interval $(0, 1/x_0)$. For any $t$ in the interval $(t_K, 1/x_0)$, the value $x(t)$ is greater than $R$, so $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ is not in $K$. This formally verifies the condition of the extension criterion. The integral curve cannot be extended beyond $t=1/x_0$ because it \"escapes to infinity\" in finite time.\n\nA vector field is complete if its flow is defined for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The flow $\\Phi_t(x_0)$ is given by $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$. Since for any $x_0  0$, the integral curve $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ is not defined for $t \\ge 1/x_0$, the flow is not defined for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, the vector field $X(x) = x^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ is not complete.\n\n**3. Determination of the Supremum of Forward Times $T(x_0)$**\n\nThe problem defines $T(x_0)$ as the supremum of positive times $T$ such that the integral curve with initial condition $\\gamma_{x_0}(0)=x_0$ remains defined for all $t \\in [0, T)$.\n\nFrom the analysis above, the solution $x(t) = \\frac{x_0}{1 - x_0 t}$ is defined on the maximal interval $I_{x_0} = (-\\infty, 1/x_0)$. The set of non-negative times for which the solution is defined is $[0, 1/x_0)$. The question asks for the supremum of values $T$ such that $[0,T) \\subseteq [0, 1/x_0)$. The largest such value is clearly $1/x_0$.\n\nTherefore, the supremum of forward times is:\n$$\nT(x_0) = \\sup\\{T  0 \\mid \\gamma_{x_0}(t) \\text{ is defined for all } t \\in [0,T)\\} = \\frac{1}{x_0}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{x_0}}\n$$", "id": "2980926"}, {"introduction": "While integral curves describe individual trajectories, the true power of a vector field lies in its ability to generate a \"flow,\" a local family of transformations of the manifold itself.

It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed as specified.\n\nThe construction of the coordinate system $(u,v)$ will be carried out in the prescribed sequence of steps.\n\n**Step 1: Find an invariant function $v$ satisfying $X(v) = 0$.**\nAn integral curve of $X$, denoted by $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$, is a solution to the system of ordinary differential equations given by $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = X(\\gamma(t))$. For $X = \\partial_{x} + x \\partial_{y}$, this corresponds to the system:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = x(t)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nIntegrating the first equation, we find $x(t) = t + C_1$. Let the initial condition at $t=0$ be $(x_0, y_0)$, so $x(0) = x_0$, which gives $C_1 = x_0$. Thus, $x(t) = t + x_0$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives $\\frac{dy}{dt} = t + x_0$. Integrating with respect to $t$ yields $y(t) = \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + x_0 t + C_2$. Using the initial condition $y(0) = y_0$, we get $C_2 = y_0$. The integral curve is therefore $\\gamma(t) = (t+x_0, \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + x_0 t + y_0)$.\n\nAn invariant function $v(x,y)$ is constant along these integral curves. We can find such a function by eliminating $t$ from the equations for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$. From $x = t+x_0$, we have $t = x-x_0$. Substituting this into the equation for $y$:\n$$y = \\frac{1}{2}(x-x_0)^2 + x_0(x-x_0) + y_0$$\n$$y = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 2xx_0 + x_0^2) + x_0x - x_0^2 + y_0$$\n$$y = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - xx_0 + \\frac{1}{2}x_0^2 + x_0x - x_0^2 + y_0$$\n$$y = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}x_0^2 + y_0$$\nRearranging this equation gives $y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2 = y_0 - \\frac{1}{2}x_0^2$. The expression on the left, $y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2$, depends only on the point $(x,y)$ and is constant along any given integral curve. We can therefore define our invariant function $v$ as:\n$$v(x,y) = y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2$$\nTo confirm, we check if $X(v)=0$:\n$$X(v) = (\\partial_{x} + x \\partial_{y})(y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2) = \\partial_{x}(y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2) + x \\partial_{y}(y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2) = (-x) + x(1) = 0$$\nThis confirms our choice of $v$.\n\n**Step 2: Find a coordinate function $u$ satisfying $X(u) = 1$.**\nWe need to solve the first-order linear partial differential equation $X(u)=1$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + x \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 1$$\nWe seek a simple solution. Let's test a function of $x$ alone, $u(x,y) = f(x)$. The equation becomes $f'(x) + x \\cdot 0 = 1$, which means $f'(x) = 1$. Integrating gives $f(x)=x+C$. The simplest choice is to take the constant $C=0$. Let's propose:\n$$u(x,y) = x$$\nWe verify this choice:\n$$X(u) = (\\partial_{x} + x \\partial_{y})(x) = \\partial_{x}(x) + x \\partial_{y}(x) = 1 + x(0) = 1$$\nThis is a valid choice for the coordinate function $u$. Our proposed coordinate system is $(u,v)$ defined by the transformation:\n$$u(x,y) = x$$\n$$v(x,y) = y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2$$\n\n**Step 3: Verify the transformation and the result.**\nFirst, we must verify that the map $(x,y) \\mapsto (u(x,y), v(x,y))$ is a local diffeomorphism near $(0,0)$. This is established by computing the Jacobian determinant and checking that it is non-zero. The Jacobian matrix of the transformation is:\n$$J = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ -x  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant of the Jacobian is:\n$$\\det(J) = (1)(1) - (0)(-x) = 1$$\nSince $\\det(J) = 1 \\neq 0$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the transformation is a local diffeomorphism everywhere, and thus certainly near $(0,0)$.\n\nSecond, we must verify that the vector field $X$ becomes $\\partial_{u}$ in the new coordinates. We can express the original basis vectors $\\partial_x$ and $\\partial_y$ in terms of the new basis vectors $\\partial_u$ and $\\partial_v$ using the chain rule:\n$$\\partial_{x} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\partial_{u} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\partial_{v} = (1)\\partial_{u} + (-x)\\partial_{v} = \\partial_{u} - x\\partial_{v}$$\n$$\\partial_{y} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\partial_{u} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\\partial_{v} = (0)\\partial_{u} + (1)\\partial_{v} = \\partial_{v}$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the definition of $X$:\n$$X = \\partial_{x} + x \\partial_{y} = (\\partial_{u} - x\\partial_{v}) + x(\\partial_{v}) = \\partial_{u} - x\\partial_{v} + x\\partial_{v} = \\partial_{u}$$\nThe transformation is successful. In the coordinate system $(u,v) = (x, y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2)$, the vector field $X$ is given by $\\partial_{u}$.\n\nThe explicit coordinate transformation is the pair of functions $(u(x,y), v(x,y))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx  y - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3037091"}, {"introduction": "Vector fields are intrinsic geometric objects, meaning their definition does not depend on a particular choice of coordinates.
