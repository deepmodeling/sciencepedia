Let $A=Q\\operatorname{diag}(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2})Q^{T}$ with $Q\\in O(2)$ and orthonormal eigenvectors $u_{1},u_{2}$.

Hence every scalar matrix is a singular point.\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the other options. Not all diagonal matrices are singular; if $A=\\operatorname{diag}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ with $\\alpha\\ne\\beta$, then $A$ is regular by Step 1, so option A is false. Matrices with $\\det(A)=0$ may have distinct eigenvalues (for instance $\\lambda_{1}=0$, $\\lambda_{2}\\ne 0$), so many such $A$ are regular; option C is false. Similarly, $\\operatorname{tr}(A)=0$ with distinct eigenvalues (e.g., $\\lambda_{1}=-\\lambda_{2}\\ne 0$) gives regular points; option D is false.
