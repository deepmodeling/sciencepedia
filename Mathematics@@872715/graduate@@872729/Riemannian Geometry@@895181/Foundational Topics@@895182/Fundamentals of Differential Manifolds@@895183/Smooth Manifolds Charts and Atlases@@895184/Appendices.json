A chart on a topological manifold $M$ is a pair $(U,\\varphi)$ with $U \\subset M$ open and $\\varphi:U \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ a homeomorphism onto its image. An atlas is a collection of charts whose domains cover $M$ and whose transition maps are smooth. A smooth atlas determines a smooth structure on $M$. For product manifolds $M \\times N$, one obtains an atlas from the product of atlases on $M$ and $N$, with transition maps given by the product of the corresponding transition maps on the factors. We will use stereographic projection to construct an atlas on $S^{1}$.\n\nStep $1$: Constructing charts on $S^{1}$ via stereographic projection. We define two charts using stereographic projection from the north pole $N=(0,1)$ and the south pole $S=(0,-1)$ onto the $x$-axis.\nThe first chart is $(S^1 \\setminus \\{N\\}, \\varphi_N)$, where the map $\\varphi_N: (x,y) \\mapsto t = \\frac{x}{1-y}$. Its inverse, $\\varphi_N^{-1}: \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1 \\setminus \\{N\\}$, is given by $t \\mapsto \\left(\\frac{2t}{1+t^2}, \\frac{t^2-1}{1+t^2}\\right)$.\nThe second chart is $(S^1 \\setminus \\{S\\}, \\varphi_S)$, where the map $\\varphi_S: (x,y) \\mapsto u = \\frac{x}{1+y}$.\nOn the overlap $S^1 \\setminus \\{N, S\\}$, the transition map $\\varphi_S \\circ \\varphi_N^{-1}$ takes a coordinate $t$ to its corresponding coordinate $u$. We find this by applying $\\varphi_S$ to the output of $\\varphi_N^{-1}(t)$:\n$$\nu = \\varphi_S\\left(\\frac{2t}{1+t^2}, \\frac{t^2-1}{1+t^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\frac{2t}{1+t^2}}{1 + \\frac{t^2-1}{1+t^2}} = \\frac{\\frac{2t}{1+t^2}}{\\frac{(1+t^2)+(t^2-1)}{1+t^2}} = \\frac{2t}{2t^2} = \\frac{1}{t}.\n$$\nThe transition map is $u=1/t$. This is smooth on $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, and its inverse $\\varphi_{N}\\circ \\varphi_{S}^{-1}(u)=1/u$ is also smooth. Hence the two stereographic charts form a smooth atlas on $S^{1}$.\n\nStep $2$: Product atlas on $T^{2}=S^{1}\\times S^{1}$. Form the product charts by taking products of the above charts on each factor. There are four such product charts:\n- $(U_{NN},\\Phi_{NN})$ with $U_{NN} = (S^{1}\\setminus\\{N\\})\\times (S^{1}\\setminus\\{N\\})$ and $\\Phi_{NN}(p,q) = (\\varphi_{N}(p),\\varphi_{N}(q)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n- $(U_{NS},\\Phi_{NS})$ with $U_{NS} = (S^{1}\\setminus\\{N\\})\\times (S^{1}\\setminus\\{S\\})$ and $\\Phi_{NS}(p,q) = (\\varphi_{N}(p),\\varphi_{S}(q))$.\n- $(U_{SN},\\Phi_{SN})$ with $U_{SN} = (S^{1}\\setminus\\{S\\})\\times (S^{1}\\setminus\\{N\\})$ and $\\Phi_{SN}(p,q) = (\\varphi_{S}(p),\\varphi_{N}(q))$.\n- $(U_{SS},\\Phi_{SS})$ with $U_{SS} = (S^{1}\\setminus\\{S\\})\\times (S^{1}\\setminus\\{S\\})$ and $\\Phi_{SS}(p,q) = (\\varphi_{S}(p),\\varphi_{S}(q))$.\n\nOn pairwise overlaps, the transition maps are products of the one-dimensional transition maps on $S^{1}$. For example, on $U_{NN}\\cap U_{SS} = (S^{1}\\setminus\\{N,S\\})\\times (S^{1}\\setminus\\{N,S\\})$, the transition map\n$$\n\\Phi_{SS}\\circ \\Phi_{NN}^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{x=0 \\text{ or } y=0\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{x=0 \\text{ or } y=0\\}\n$$\nis given by\n$$\n(x,y) \\mapsto \\left(\\frac{1}{x}, \\frac{1}{y}\\right),\n$$\nsince each factor uses the $t \\mapsto 1/t$ transition of $S^{1}$. This is smooth wherever $x\\neq 0$ and $y\\neq 0$. Similar reasoning applies to all other overlaps, proving that the product charts define a smooth atlas on $T^{2}$.\n\nStep $3$: Jacobian determinant of the transition map at the specified point. We are asked to compute the determinant of the Jacobian of the map\n$$\nF(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{x}, \\frac{1}{y}\\right)\n$$\nat the point $(x,y)=(2,-\\tfrac{1}{3})$, which lies in the overlap domain since $x\\neq 0$ and $y\\neq 0$.\n\nCompute the Jacobian matrix $DF(x,y)$.

From this definition, it is clear that the unit sphere $S^{n}$ is precisely the level set of $F$ corresponding to the value $1$, i.e., $S^{n} = F^{-1}(1)$.\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the regular value characterization of smooth submanifolds. The Regular Value Theorem (also known as the Preimage Theorem) states that if $c$ is a regular value of a smooth map $f: M \\to N$ between smooth manifolds, then the preimage $f^{-1}(c)$ is a smooth submanifold of $M$. Furthermore, for any point $p \\in f^{-1}(c)$, the tangent space to the submanifold at $p$ is given by the kernel of the differential of $f$ at $p$:\n$$T_{p}(f^{-1}(c)) = \\ker(df_{p})$$\n\nIn our context, the ambient manifold is $M = \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, the target manifold is $N = \\mathbb{R}$, the function is $F(x) = \\langle x, x \\rangle$, and the level set corresponds to the value $c=1$. To apply the theorem, we must first verify that $1$ is a regular value of $F$.\n\nA value $c \\in N$ is a regular value of $f: M \\to N$ if for every point $p \\in f^{-1}(c)$, the differential $df_{p}: T_{p}M \\to T_{c}N$ is a surjective (onto) linear map.\n\nHere, we consider a point $p \\in S^n = F^{-1}(1)$. The differential of $F$ at $p$, denoted $dF_{p}$, is a linear map from $T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ to $T_{1}\\mathbb{R}$. We can canonically identify the tangent spaces $T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and $T_{1}\\mathbb{R}$ with $\\mathbb{R}$. The action of the differential $dF_{p}$ on a tangent vector $v \\in T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is given by the directional derivative of $F$ at $p$ in the direction of $v$:\n$$dF_{p}(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} F(p + tv)$$\nSubstituting the definition of $F$:\n$$dF_{p}(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\langle p + tv, p + tv \\rangle$$\nUsing the bilinearity of the inner product, we expand the expression:\n$$\\langle p + tv, p + tv \\rangle = \\langle p, p \\rangle + t\\langle p, v \\rangle + t\\langle v, p \\rangle + t^2\\langle v, v \\rangle$$\nSince the standard Euclidean inner product is symmetric, $\\langle p, v \\rangle = \\langle v, p \\rangle$. Thus:\n$$\\langle p + tv, p + tv \\rangle = \\langle p, p \\rangle + 2t\\langle p, v \\rangle + t^2\\langle v, v \\rangle$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $t$ and evaluate at $t=0$:\n$$dF_{p}(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (\\langle p, p \\rangle + 2t\\langle p, v \\rangle + t^2\\langle v, v \\rangle) = 2\\langle p, v \\rangle + 2t\\langle v, v \\rangle \\bigg|_{t=0} = 2\\langle p, v \\rangle$$\nSo, the differential is the linear map $dF_{p}: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ given by $v \\mapsto 2\\langle p, v \\rangle$.\n\nFor $1$ to be a regular value, this map must be surjective for every $p \\in S^{n}$. The codomain is $\\mathbb{R}$, a $1$-dimensional vector space. A linear map to a $1$-dimensional space is surjective if and only if it is not the zero map. The map $dF_{p}$ is the zero map if and only if $2\\langle p, v \\rangle = 0$ for all vectors $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. This condition, $\\langle p, v \\rangle = 0$ for all $v$, implies that $p$ must be the zero vector, $p=0$.\n\nHowever, we are restricted to points $p \\in S^{n}$. By definition, any point $p \\in S^{n}$ satisfies $\\langle p, p \\rangle = \\|p\\|^2 = 1$. This implies that $p$ is never the zero vector. Therefore, for any $p \\in S^{n}$, the differential $dF_{p}$ is a non-zero linear functional and is, consequently, surjective.\n\nThis confirms that $1$ is a regular value of $F$. By the Regular Value Theorem, $S^{n}$ is a smooth submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The theorem also provides the characterization of the tangent space $T_{p}S^{n}$ as the kernel of the differential $dF_{p}$:\n$$T_{p}S^{n} = \\ker(dF_{p})$$\nThe kernel of $dF_{p}$ is the set of all vectors $v \\in T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that are mapped to zero by $dF_{p}$:\n$$T_{p}S^{n} = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\mid dF_{p}(v) = 0\\}$$\nSubstituting our expression for the differential, we get:\n$$T_{p}S^{n} = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\mid 2\\langle p, v \\rangle = 0\\}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$T_{p}S^{n} = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\mid \\langle p, v \\rangle = 0\\}$$\nThis expression provides the canonical identification of the tangent space $T_{p}S^{n}$ as a subspace of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. It is the set of all vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that are orthogonal to the position vector $p$.

Derivation of the Transition Map**\nThe transition map is $\\psi = \\phi_1 \\circ \\phi_0^{-1}$, and its domain is $\\phi_0(U_0 \\cap U_1)$.\n\nFirst, let's characterize the intersection $U_0 \\cap U_1$. A point $p \\in M$ is in $U_0 \\cap U_1$ if it has a preimage in $W_0$ and a preimage in $W_1$. Let $p = \\pi(x_0, y_0)$ with $(x_0, y_0) \\in W_0$. For $p$ to also be in $U_1$, it must be the image of some point $(x_1, y_1) \\in W_1$. The relation $\\pi(x_0, y_0) = \\pi(x_1, y_1)$ implies there exists an integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $(x_1, y_1) = T^n(x_0, y_0) = (x_0+n, (-1)^n y_0)$.\nWe have $x_0 \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ and $x_1 = x_0+n \\in (1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon)$. This gives $1-\\epsilon-x_0 < n < 1+\\epsilon-x_0$. Since $-\\epsilon < x_0 < \\epsilon$, we have $1-2\\epsilon < n < 1+2\\epsilon$. Given $\\epsilon \\in (0, \\frac{1}{2})$, we have $0 < 1-2\\epsilon < 1$ and $1 < 1+2\\epsilon < 2$. The only integer $n$ satisfying this is $n=1$.\nThus, a point $p \\in U_0$ represented by $(x_0, y_0) \\in W_0$ is in $U_1$ if and only if $T^1(x_0, y_0) = (x_0+1, -y_0)$ is in $W_1$. The condition $x_0+1 \\in (1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon)$ simplifies to $x_0 \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$, which is always true for $(x_0, y_0) \\in W_0$. The condition $-y_0 \\in (-1,1)$ is also always true. Therefore, $U_0 \\subseteq U_1$.\nA similar argument starting with $p \\in U_1$ represented by $(x_1,y_1) \\in W_1$ shows that $p \\in U_0$ if and only if $T^{-1}(x_1,y_1) = (x_1-1, -y_1) \\in W_0$. This is true for all points in $W_1$. Thus, $U_1 \\subseteq U_0$.\nWe conclude that $U_0 = U_1$. The domain of $\\psi$ is $\\phi_0(U_0) = V_0 = (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\times (-1,1)$.\n\nLet $(t,s) \\in V_0$. We want to compute $\\psi(t,s) = \\phi_1(\\phi_0^{-1}(t,s))$.\n- Step 1: $\\phi_0^{-1}$ maps the coordinate $(t,s)$ to the point $p \\in M$. By definition of $\\phi_0$, $p = \\pi(t,s)$, where $(t,s) \\in W_0$.\n- Step 2: We apply $\\phi_1$ to $p$. By definition of $\\phi_1$, we must first find the unique preimage of $p$ in $W_1$. We seek $(x',y') \\in W_1$ such that $\\pi(x',y') = p = \\pi(t,s)$. As shown above, this means $(x',y') = T^1(t,s) = (t+1, -s)$.\n- Step 3: We apply the translation $S$:\n$$ \\psi(t,s) = \\phi_1(p) = S(x',y') = S(t+1, -s) = ((t+1)-1, -s) = (t, -s) $$\nSo, the transition map is $\\psi: (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\times (-1,1) \\to (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\times (-1,1)$ given by:\n$$ \\psi(t,s) = (t, -s) $$\n\n**3.

The Jacobian matrix of $\\psi$ at a point $(t,s)$ is given by:\n$$ J_{\\psi}(t,s) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\psi_1}{\\partial t} & \\frac{\\partial \\psi_1}{\\partial s} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\psi_2}{\\partial t} & \\frac{\\partial \\psi_2}{\\partial s} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\psi_1}{\\partial t} = 1, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\psi_1}{\\partial s} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\psi_2}{\\partial t} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\psi_2}{\\partial s} = -1 $$\nThe Jacobian matrix is therefore constant for all $(t,s)$ in the domain:\n$$ J_{\\psi}(t,s) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n$$ \\det(J_{\\psi}(t,s)) = (1)(-1) - (0)(0) = -1 $$\nThe determinant is $-1$.
