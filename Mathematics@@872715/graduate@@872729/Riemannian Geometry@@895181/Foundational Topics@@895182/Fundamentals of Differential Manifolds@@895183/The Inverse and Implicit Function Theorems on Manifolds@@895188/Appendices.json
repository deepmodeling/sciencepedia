It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with all necessary definitions provided or implied by the standard context of the field. We proceed with the solution.\n\nOur objective is to compute the differential of the exponential map $\\exp_{p} \\colon T_{p}M \\to M$ at the origin $0 \\in T_{p}M$. This differential is a linear map $d(\\exp_{p})_{0} \\colon T_{0}(T_{p}M) \\to T_{\\exp_{p}(0)}M$.\n\nFirst, we identify the domain and codomain of this linear map. The domain is the tangent space to the manifold $T_{p}M$ at the point $0$. Since $T_{p}M$ is a vector space, there exists a canonical isomorphism between its tangent space at any point and the vector space itself. Thus, we have the identification $T_{0}(T_{p}M) \\simeq T_{p}M$.\n\nNext, we identify the point $\\exp_{p}(0)$ in the codomain manifold $M$. By definition, $\\exp_{p}(0) = \\gamma_{0}(1)$, where $\\gamma_{0}$ is the geodesic starting at $p$ with initial velocity $0$. The curve $\\gamma_{0}(t) = p$ for all $t$ satisfies these conditions: $\\gamma_{0}(0) = p$ and its tangent vector $\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}(t)$ is the zero vector for all $t$. The geodesic equation $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}} \\dot{\\gamma}_{0} = \\nabla_{0} 0 = 0$ is trivially satisfied. Thus, the constant curve at $p$ is the required geodesic. It follows that $\\exp_{p}(0) = \\gamma_{0}(1) = p$. Consequently, the codomain of the differential is $T_{p}M$.\n\nUnder these identifications, the differential is a linear map $d(\\exp_{p})_{0} \\colon T_{p}M \\to T_{p}M$.\n\nTo compute this map, we use the definition of the differential applied to a vector $W \\in T_{p}M$. We choose a curve in the domain $T_{p}M$ that starts at $0$ and has initial velocity $W$. The simplest such curve is $\\alpha(s) = sW$ for $s \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$. Here, $\\alpha(0) = 0$ and the tangent vector $\\alpha'(s)$ is identified with $W$ for all $s$ under the canonical identification $T_{sW}(T_p M) \\simeq T_p M$. Thus $\\alpha'(0)$ corresponds to $W$.\n\nThe differential $d(\\exp_{p})_{0}$ applied to $W$ is then the tangent vector at $s=0$ to the curve in $M$ given by the composition $\\exp_{p} \\circ \\alpha$:\n$$\nd(\\exp_{p})_{0}(W) = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} (\\exp_{p} \\circ \\alpha)(s) = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} \\exp_{p}(sW)\n$$\n\nTo evaluate this derivative, we employ the theory of geodesic variations and Jacobi fields, as suggested by the problem. Consider the two-parameter variation of geodesics $F \\colon (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\times [0, 1] \\to M$ defined by\n$$\nF(s, t) = \\exp_{p}(t(sW)) = \\exp_{p}(tsW)\n$$\nFor a fixed $s$, the curve $t \\mapsto F(s,t)$ is the geodesic starting at $p$ with initial velocity $sW$.\nThe vector we wish to compute is the variational vector field along the curve $t \\mapsto F(0,t)$ evaluated at $t=1$. This is $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial s}(0, 1)$.\n\nThe vector field $J(t) = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial s}(0, t)$ is a Jacobi field along the base geodesic $\\gamma(t) = F(0, t)$. The base geodesic is $\\gamma(t) = \\exp_{p}(t \\cdot 0 \\cdot W) = \\exp_{p}(0) = p$. This is the constant geodesic at $p$, so its velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0$ for all $t$.\n\nA Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\nabla_{t}^{2} J(t) + R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_{t}$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. Since $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0$, the curvature term vanishes, and the Jacobi equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla_{t}^{2} J(t) = 0\n$$\nSince the base geodesic is a single point $p$, covariant differentiation along $\\gamma$ is just ordinary differentiation of vectors in the fixed tangent space $T_pM$. The equation becomes $\\frac{d^{2}J}{dt^{2}} = 0$, and its general solution is a linear function of $t$:\n$$\nJ(t) = A + tB\n$$\nwhere $A, B \\in T_pM$ are constant vectors determined by the initial conditions of the Jacobi field at $t=0$.\n\nThe initial conditions are $J(0)$ and its covariant derivative $\\nabla_{t}J(0)$.\nFirst, $J(0) = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial s}(0, 0)$. Since $F(s, 0) = \\exp_{p}(0 \\cdot sW) = \\exp_{p}(0) = p$ for all $s$, we have:\n$$\nJ(0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}\\bigg|_{s=0} p = 0 \\in T_{p}M\n$$\nNext, we compute $\\nabla_{t}J(0)$. Using the symmetry of the connection for coordinate vector fields (which we can extend to variational fields), we have $\\nabla_{t} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial s} = \\nabla_{s} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t}$. We evaluate this at $(s,t)=(0,0)$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{t}J(0) = \\nabla_{s}\\bigg|_{s=0} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t}(s, t) \\right)\\bigg|_{t=0}\n$$\nThe vector field $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t}(s,t)$ is the velocity vector of the geodesic $t \\mapsto F(s,t)$. At $t=0$, this is the initial velocity, which is $sW$. So, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t}(s,0) = sW$.\nWe now need to compute the covariant derivative with respect to $s$ of the vector field $s \\mapsto sW$ at $s=0$. Since this is a curve of vectors within the single vector space $T_pM$, the covariant derivative is just the ordinary derivative:\n$$\n\\nabla_{s}\\bigg|_{s=0} (sW) = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} (sW) = W\n$$\nSo, the initial conditions for the Jacobi field are $J(0) = 0$ and $\\nabla_{t}J(0) = W$.\n\nSubstituting these into the general solution $J(t) = A + tB$:\n$J(0) = A = 0$.\n$\\nabla_{t}J(t) = B$, so $\\nabla_{t}J(0) = B = W$.\nTherefore, the Jacobi field is given by $J(t) = tW$.\n\nFinally, the vector we want to compute is $d(\\exp_{p})_{0}(W)$, which is given by the Jacobi field at $t=1$:\n$$\nd(\\exp_{p})_{0}(W) = J(1) = 1 \\cdot W = W\n$$\nSince this holds for any arbitrary vector $W \\in T_{p}M$, the map $d(\\exp_{p})_{0} \\colon T_{p}M \\to T_{p}M$ is the identity map, $d(\\exp_{p})_{0} = \\mathrm{Id}_{T_p M}$.\n\nThis result allows us to invoke the inverse function theorem on manifolds. The theorem states that if $f \\colon N_{1} \\to N_{2}$ is a smooth map between manifolds, and its differential $df_{q} \\colon T_{q}N_{1} \\to T_{f(q)}N_{2}$ is a linear isomorphism at a point $q \\in N_{1}$, then $f$ is a local diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of $q$ to a neighborhood of $f(q)$.\n\nIn our case, the map is $\\exp_{p} \\colon T_{p}M \\to M$ and the point is $0 \\in T_{p}M$. We have computed its differential at this point, $d(\\exp_{p})_{0} \\colon T_{p}M \\to T_{p}M$, to be the identity map $\\mathrm{Id}_{T_p M}$. The identity map on a vector space is trivially a linear isomorphism (it is its own inverse). Therefore, by the inverse function theorem, $\\exp_{p}$ is a local diffeomorphism from some neighborhood of $0$ in $T_{p}M$ to a neighborhood of $\\exp_{p}(0)=p$ in $M$.

This is equivalent to requiring that the vector $f'(\\theta)$ is never the zero vector $(0,0)$.\n    $f'(\\theta) = (0,0)$ requires both $2\\cos(2\\theta) = 0$ and $3\\cos(3\\theta) = 0$.\n    1.  $\\cos(2\\theta) = 0 \\implies 2\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi \\implies \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2}$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    2.  $\\cos(3\\theta) = 0 \\implies 3\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi \\implies \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\frac{m\\pi}{3}$ for $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Equating the expressions for $\\theta$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\frac{m\\pi}{3}\n    $$\n    Multiplying by $\\frac{12}{\\pi}$ gives $3 + 6k = 2 + 4m$, which simplifies to $1 + 6k = 4m$. The left side of this equation is always odd, while the right side is always even. Thus, there are no integer solutions for $k$ and $m$. This proves that $f'(\\theta)$ is never the zero vector. Therefore, $f$ is an immersion at every point of $S^1$.\n*   An **embedding** is an immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image. A homeomorphism must be injective. As noted, $f([0]) = (0,0)$ and $f([\\pi]) = (0,0)$. Since $[0] \\neq [\\pi]$ in $S^1$, the map $f$ is not injective. A non-injective map cannot be a homeomorphism.\n*   Thus, $f$ is an immersion but not an embedding. The reason given (non-injectivity) is correct.\n\n**Verdict for A:** Correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\n*   The Inverse Function Theorem on manifolds states that if a smooth map $F \\colon M \\to N$ has an invertible differential $dF_p$ at a point $p \\in M$, then $F$ is a local diffeomorphism at $p$.\n*   A necessary condition for the differential $dF_p \\colon T_p M \\to T_{F(p)} N$ to be invertible is that the tangent spaces have the same dimension, i.e., $\\dim(M) = \\dim(N)$.\n*   In our case, the domain is $M = S^1$ with $\\dim(S^1)=1$, and the codomain is $N = \\mathbb{R}^2$ with $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^2)=2$.\n*   Since the dimensions are not equal, the differential $d f_p$ cannot be an isomorphism for any $p \\in S^1$. Therefore, the Inverse Function Theorem cannot be applied to conclude that $f$ is a local diffeomorphism.\n\n**Verdict for B:** Incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\n*   The Constant Rank Theorem is a generalization of the Inverse and Implicit Function Theorems. One of its main consequences is the local normal form for immersions.\n*   Since $f \\colon S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ is an immersion, the rank of its differential $df_{[\\theta]}$ is constant and equal to $\\dim(S^1)=1$ for all $[\\theta] \\in S^1$.\n*   The theorem states that for any point $p \\in S^1$, there exist charts $(U, \\phi)$ centered at $p$ and $(V, \\psi)$ centered at $f(p)$ such that the local representation of $f$ is given by $\\psi \\circ f \\circ \\phi^{-1}(t) = (t, 0)$.\n*   Option C applies this theorem to the points $p_1 = [0]$ and $p_2 = [\\pi]$. It correctly states that for each point $p_i$ ($i=1, 2$), one can find a pair of charts $(U_i, \\phi_i)$ and $(V_i, \\psi_i)$ that \"straighten out\" the corresponding branch of the curve near $q=f(p_i)$. The theorem guarantees the existence of such charts for each branch independently. The notation appropriately indicates that the charts $(V_1, \\psi_1)$ and $(V_2, \\psi_2)$ for the target space may be different.\n\n**Verdict for C:** Correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\n*   Two immersed curves intersecting at a point $q$ are said to intersect transversely if the sum of their tangent spaces at $q$ spans the tangent space of the ambient manifold. Here, we analyze the intersection of the two branches of $f(S^1)$ at $q=(0,0)$.\n*   The tangent spaces of the branches are the images of the differential at the corresponding preimages.\n*   The preimages of $q=(0,0)$ are $p_1=[0]$ and $p_2=[\\pi]$.\n*   The tangent vector for the branch corresponding to $p_1= [0]$ is:\n    $$\n    v_1 = f'(0) = (2\\cos(0), 3\\cos(0)) = (2, 3)\n    $$\n    The image of the tangent space is the line spanned by $v_1$, i.e., $\\text{Im}(df_{p_1}) = \\text{span}\\{(2,3)\\}$.\n*   The tangent vector for the branch corresponding to $p_2=[\\pi]$ is:\n    $$\n    v_2 = f'(\\pi) = (2\\cos(2\\pi), 3\\cos(3\\pi)) = (2(1), 3(-1)) = (2, -3)\n    $$\n    The image of the tangent space is the line spanned by $v_2$, i.e., $\\text{Im}(df_{p_2}) = \\text{span}\\{(2,-3)\\}$.\n*   The intersection is transverse if these two lines are distinct, which is equivalent to the vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ being linearly independent. We check this by computing the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors:\n    $$\n    \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\\\ 3 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(-3) - (2)(3) = -6 - 6 = -12 \\neq 0\n    $$\n*   Since the determinant is non-zero, the vectors are linearly independent. Thus, the tangent lines are distinct, and their sum spans $T_q \\mathbb{R}^2 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$. The intersection is transverse.\n\n**Verdict for D:** Correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\n\n*   This option claims the existence of a single coordinate chart $(V, \\psi)$ around $q=(0,0)$ in which the two intersecting branches take a specific graphical form. This is a statement about the local normal form for a transverse intersection.\n*   We can construct such a chart using the Inverse Function Theorem. Let $\\gamma_1(t) = f(t)$ for $t$ near $0$, and $\\gamma_2(s) = f(\\pi+s)$ for $s$ near $0$. We have $\\gamma_1(0)=\\gamma_2(0)=q$ and tangent vectors $\\gamma_1'(0)=v_1=(2,3)$ and $\\gamma_2'(0)=v_2=(2,-3)$.\n*   Define a map $\\Phi \\colon \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ from a neighborhood of $(0,0)$ by $\\Phi(t,s) = \\gamma_1(t) + \\gamma_2(s) - q$.\n*   The differential of $\\Phi$ at $(0,0)$ has as columns the vectors $\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial t}(0,0) = \\gamma_1'(0) = v_1$ and $\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial s}(0,0) = \\gamma_2'(0) = v_2$. The Jacobian matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\\\ 3 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is invertible as shown in D.\n*   By the IFT, $\\Phi$ is a local diffeomorphism. Its inverse $\\psi = \\Phi^{-1}$ is a valid coordinate chart around $q = \\Phi(0,0)$.\n*   Let's find the representation of the branches in this chart $\\psi$.\n    - For the first branch, note that $\\Phi(t,0) = \\gamma_1(t) + \\gamma_2(0) - q = \\gamma_1(t) + q - q = \\gamma_1(t) = f(t)$. Applying $\\psi$ gives $\\psi(f(t)) = \\psi(\\Phi(t,0)) = (t,0)$. This curve is of the form $\\{(t, g_1(t))\\}$ with $g_1(t) \\equiv 0$, so $g_1(0)=0$ and $g_1'(0)=0$.\n    - For the second branch, note that $\\Phi(0,s) = \\gamma_1(0) + \\gamma_2(s) - q = q + \\gamma_2(s) - q = \\gamma_2(s) = f(\\pi+s)$. Applying $\\psi$ gives $\\psi(f(\\pi+s)) = \\psi(\\Phi(0,s)) = (0,s)$. This curve is of the form $\\{(h_2(s), s)\\}$ with $h_2(s) \\equiv 0$, so $h_2(0)=0$ and $h_2'(0)=0$.\n*   The constructed chart $\\psi$ satisfies the conditions of the statement.\n\n**Verdict for E:** Correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option F**\n\n*   An embedded submanifold is a subset of a manifold which is itself a manifold with the subspace topology. A necessary condition is that every point in the subset must have a neighborhood (in the subset topology) that is homeomorphic to an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ for some fixed $k$.\n*   Consider the self-intersection point $q=(0,0)$ in the image $f(S^1)$. Any neighborhood of $q$ in $f(S^1)$ contains parts of four distinct arcs meeting at $q$ (corresponding to $\\theta$ near $0$, $2\\pi$, and $\\pi$). This neighborhood is topologically a cross ('X').\n*   If we remove the point $q$ from such a neighborhood, the space becomes disconnected into four components. An open interval in $\\mathbb{R}^1$ (the model for a $1$-dimensional manifold) becomes disconnected into two components upon removal of a point. Since the number of connected components is a topological invariant, a neighborhood of $q$ in $f(S^1)$ is not homeomorphic to an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}^1$.\n*   Therefore, $f(S^1)$ is not a manifold, and consequently cannot be an embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. It is an example of an immersed submanifold that is not embedded.\n\n**Verdict for F:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDE}$$", "id": "2999397"}]}
