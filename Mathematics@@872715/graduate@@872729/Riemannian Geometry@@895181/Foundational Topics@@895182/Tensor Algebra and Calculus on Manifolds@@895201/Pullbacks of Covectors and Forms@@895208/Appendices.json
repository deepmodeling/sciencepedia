We must first show that the pullback $f^*\\omega$ of any nonzero $2$-form $\\omega$ on $N$ vanishes identically. Then, we must interpret this result in terms of the differential of $f$ and the Brouwer degree of $f$, and finally compute this degree.\n\nLet the manifolds $M$ and $N$ be represented by the torus $T^2$ with coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi)$, where $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The smooth map $f: M \\to N$ is given by $f(\\theta, \\phi) = (\\theta, 0)$.\n\nFirst, we will show that $f^*\\omega = 0$. The pullback of a differential $k$-form $\\alpha$ on $N$ by a smooth map $f: M \\to N$ is a $k$-form $f^*\\alpha$ on $M$ defined at each point $p \\in M$ and for any set of tangent vectors $v_1, \\dots, v_k \\in T_pM$ by\n$$\n(f^*\\alpha)_p(v_1, \\dots, v_k) = \\alpha_{f(p)}(df_p(v_1), \\dots, df_p(v_k)),\n$$\nwhere $df_p: T_pM \\to T_{f(p)}N$ is the differential (or pushforward) of the map $f$ at $p$.\n\nIn our case, $\\omega$ is a $2$-form on $N=T^2$. The pullback $f^*\\omega$ is a $2$-form on $M=T^2$. To check if $f^*\\omega$ is identically zero, it is sufficient to evaluate it on a basis of the tangent space $T_pM$ for an arbitrary point $p=(\\theta_0, \\phi_0) \\in M$. A natural basis for $T_pM$ is given by the coordinate vectors $(\\partial_{\\theta}|_p, \\partial_{\\phi}|_p)$.\n\nWe must first compute the differential $df_p$. Let the coordinates on $M$ be $(x^1, x^2) = (\\theta, \\phi)$ and on $N$ be $(y^1, y^2) = (\\theta, \\phi)$. The map $f$ is given in these coordinates by $y^1(x^1, x^2) = x^1$ and $y^2(x^1, x^2) = 0$. The matrix of the differential $df_p$, also known as the Jacobian matrix, is\n$$\nJ_f(p) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial y^1}{\\partial x^1}  \\frac{\\partial y^1}{\\partial x^2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y^2}{\\partial x^1}  \\frac{\\partial y^2}{\\partial x^2} \\end{pmatrix}_p = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\theta}  \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\phi} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial 0}{\\partial \\theta}  \\frac{\\partial 0}{\\partial \\phi} \\end{pmatrix}_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe action of the differential $df_p$ on the basis vectors is:\n$$\ndf_p(\\partial_{\\theta}|_p) = 1 \\cdot \\partial_{\\theta}|_{f(p)} + 0 \\cdot \\partial_{\\phi}|_{f(p)} = \\partial_{\\theta}|_{f(p)}\n$$\n$$\ndf_p(\\partial_{\\phi}|_p) = 0 \\cdot \\partial_{\\theta}|_{f(p)} + 0 \\cdot \\partial_{\\phi}|_{f(p)} = 0_{f(p)}\n$$\nwhere $0_{f(p)}$ denotes the zero vector in the tangent space $T_{f(p)}N$.\n\nNow we can compute the value of the pullback form $(f^*\\omega)_p$ on the basis vectors:\n$$\n(f^*\\omega)_p(\\partial_{\\theta}|_p, \\partial_{\\phi}|_p) = \\omega_{f(p)}(df_p(\\partial_{\\theta}|_p), df_p(\\partial_{\\phi}|_p)) = \\omega_{f(p)}(\\partial_{\\theta}|_{f(p)}, 0_{f(p)}).\n$$\nSince $\\omega$ is a $2$-form, it is a bilinear map on each tangent space. By the property of bilinearity, for any vector $v$, $\\omega(v, 0) = 0$. Thus,\n$$\n(f^*\\omega)_p(\\partial_{\\theta}|_p, \\partial_{\\phi}|_p) = 0.\n$$\nA $2$-form on a $2$-dimensional manifold is completely determined by its value on any pair of basis vectors of the tangent space. Since $(f^*\\omega)_p$ vanishes on the basis $(\\partial_{\\theta}|_p, \\partial_{\\phi}|_p)$ for any arbitrary point $p \\in M$, the form $f^*\\omega$ is identically zero on $M$.\n\nNext, we interpret this result. The fact that $f^*\\omega$ vanishes for any top-degree form $\\omega$ is a direct consequence of the rank of the differential $df_p$. The rank of the Jacobian matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ is $1$. Since $\\text{rank}(df_p) = 1  2 = \\dim(M) = \\dim(N)$, the differential $df_p$ is not surjective for any $p \\in M$. This means that every point $p \\in M$ is a critical point of $f$. The image of the tangent space $T_pM$ under $df_p$ is a $1$-dimensional subspace of $T_{f(p)}N$, spanned by $\\partial_{\\theta}|_{f(p)}$. When the pullback $(f^*\\omega)_p$ is evaluated on any two vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in T_pM$, their images $df_p(v_1)$ and $df_p(v_2)$ are both in this $1$-dimensional subspace and are therefore linearly dependent. Since $\\omega$ is an alternating $2$-form, its value on a linearly dependent set of vectors is zero: $\\omega_{f(p)}(df_p(v_1), df_p(v_2)) = 0$. This gives a general explanation for why $f^*\\omega \\equiv 0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Brouwer degree of $f$, denoted $\\text{deg}(f)$. For a smooth map $f: M \\to N$ between compact, connected, oriented $n$-manifolds, the degree is an integer that relates the integrals of forms via the pullback. Specifically, for any $n$-form $\\alpha$ on $N$, the following relationship holds:\n$$\n\\int_M f^*\\alpha = \\text{deg}(f) \\int_N \\alpha.\n$$\nTo determine $\\text{deg}(f)$, we can choose any $2$-form $\\omega$ on $N$ for which $\\int_N \\omega \\neq 0$. Such a form exists because $N$ is a compact, oriented, connected $2$-manifold (e.g., any volume form associated with a Riemannian metric on $N$ would have a positive integral). Let's take such a form $\\omega$.\n\nWe have already proven that for our specific map $f$, the pullback $f^*\\omega$ is identically zero for *any* $2$-form $\\omega$ on $N$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\int_M f^*\\omega = \\int_M 0 = 0.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the degree formula, we get:\n$$\n0 = \\text{deg}(f) \\int_N \\omega.\n$$\nSince we chose $\\omega$ such that $\\int_N \\omega \\neq 0$, the only way for this equation to hold is if the integer $\\text{deg}(f)$ is zero.\n$$\n\\text{deg}(f) = 0.\n$$\nThis result is consistent with another interpretation of the degree. The degree of a map can be computed at any regular value $y \\in N$ by summing the signs of the determinants of the differentials at the preimage points $f^{-1}(y)$. A map with no regular values is not surjective, and if it's not surjective, its degree must be $0$. In our case, every point in $M$ is a critical point, so $f$ has no regular points, and consequently, no regular values. The image of $f$ is the circle $\\{(\\theta, 0) | \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)\\}$, which has measure zero in $N$. Any point $y$ not on this circle has an empty preimage, leading to a degree of $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2987837"}]}
