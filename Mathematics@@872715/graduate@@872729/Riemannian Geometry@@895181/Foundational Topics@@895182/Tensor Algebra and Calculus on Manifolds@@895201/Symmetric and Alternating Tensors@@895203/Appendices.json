Construction of a Symmetric Tensor $T$**\n\nSince the dimension of $V$ is $n \\geq 3$, we can choose at least three linearly independent basis vectors. Let us pick two distinct basis vectors, $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$. We need to construct a nonzero tensor $T \\in V^{\\otimes 3}$ that is symmetric in the first two slots. A tensor $T$ is symmetric in the first two slots if it is invariant under the action of the transposition $\\tau_{12}$ which swaps the first two factors, i.e., $\\tau_{12} \\cdot T = T$.\n\nLet's construct the simplest such tensor using our chosen basis vectors. Consider the tensor:\n$$ T = e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2} $$\nThis tensor is nonzero because it is formed from basis vectors. Let's verify its symmetry. The action of $\\tau_{12}$ on $T$ is:\n$$ \\tau_{12} \\cdot T = \\tau_{12} \\cdot (e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2}) $$\nBy definition, $\\tau_{12}$ swaps the first two vectors in the tensor product. In this case, both vectors are $e_{1}$. So,\n$$ \\tau_{12} \\cdot T = e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2} = T $$\nThus, $T = e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2}$ is symmetric in the first two tensor slots as required.\n\n**2. Explicit Computation of $\\operatorname{Alt}(T)$**\n\nWe now compute $\\operatorname{Alt}(T)$ for our chosen tensor $T = e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2}$. The symmetric group $S_3$ has $3! = 6$ elements. We list their actions on $T$ and their signs.\nThe elements of $S_3$ are:\n- The identity permutation, $id$, with $\\operatorname{sgn}(id) = +1$.\n- The three transpositions: $\\tau_{12}=(12)$, $\\tau_{13}=(13)$, $\\tau_{23}=(23)$, all with sign $-1$.\n- The two $3$-cycles: $\\sigma_{123}=(123)$ and $\\sigma_{132}=(132)$, both with sign $+1$.\n\nLet's compute the action of each permutation on $T = e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2}$:\n- $id \\cdot T = e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2}$\n- $\\tau_{12} \\cdot T = e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2}$ (swaps the first two factors, which are identical)\n- $\\tau_{13} \\cdot T = e_{2} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{1}$ (swaps the first and third factors)\n- $\\tau_{23} \\cdot T = e_{1} \\otimes e_{2} \\otimes e_{1}$ (swaps the second and third factors)\n- $\\sigma_{123} \\cdot T = \\sigma_{123} \\cdot (e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2}) = e_{2} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{1}$ (sends factor at position $1 \\to 2$, $2 \\to 3$, $3 \\to 1$)\n- $\\sigma_{132} \\cdot T = \\sigma_{132} \\cdot (e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2}) = e_{1} \\otimes e_{2} \\otimes e_{1}$ (sends factor at position $1 \\to 3$, $3 \\to 2$, $2 \\to 1$)\n\nNow, we apply the alternation formula:\n$$ \\operatorname{Alt}(T) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\operatorname{sgn}(id)(id \\cdot T) + \\operatorname{sgn}(\\tau_{12})(\\tau_{12} \\cdot T) + \\operatorname{sgn}(\\tau_{13})(\\tau_{13} \\cdot T) + \\operatorname{sgn}(\\tau_{23})(\\tau_{23} \\cdot T) + \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma_{123})(\\sigma_{123} \\cdot T) + \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma_{132})(\\sigma_{132} \\cdot T) \\right) $$\nSubstituting the results and signs:\n$$ \\operatorname{Alt}(T) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( (+1)(e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2}) + (-1)(e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2}) + (-1)(e_{2} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{1}) + (-1)(e_{1} \\otimes e_{2} \\otimes e_{1}) + (+1)(e_{2} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{1}) + (+1)(e_{1} \\otimes e_{2} \\otimes e_{1}) \\right) $$\nGrouping the terms:\n$$ \\operatorname{Alt}(T) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ (e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2} - e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{2}) + (e_{2} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{1} - e_{2} \\otimes e_{1} \\otimes e_{1}) + (e_{1} \\otimes e_{2} \\otimes e_{1} - e_{1} \\otimes e_{2} \\otimes e_{1}) \\right] $$\n$$ \\operatorname{Alt}(T) = \\frac{1}{6} [0 + 0 + 0] = 0 $$\nThe result of the computation is the zero tensor in $V^{\\otimes 3}$, which corresponds to the zero element in $\\Lambda^{3}V$.\n\n**3. Rigorous Justification**\n\nWe now provide a more general and abstract justification for why the alternation of any tensor symmetric in two slots must vanish. This argument relies on the group structure of $S_3$ and the definition of the alternation operator.\n\nLet $T \\in V^{\\otimes 3}$ be any tensor that is symmetric in the first two slots. This property is expressed as $\\tau_{12} \\cdot T = T$, where $\\tau_{12}$ is the transposition $(12)$.\n\nThe set of permutations $S_3$ can be partitioned into the set of even permutations, $A_{3} = \\{id, \\sigma_{123}, \\sigma_{132}\\}$, and the set of odd permutations, $O_{3} = \\{\\tau_{12}, \\tau_{13}, \\tau_{23}\\}$.\nThe alternation operator can be written by summing over these two sets:\n$$ \\operatorname{Alt}(T) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\sum_{\\sigma \\in A_{3}} \\sigma \\cdot T - \\sum_{\\pi \\in O_{3}} \\pi \\cdot T \\right) $$\nLet's analyze the sum over the odd permutations. Right multiplication by the transposition $\\tau_{12}$ defines a bijection from the set of even permutations to the set of odd permutations: $\\phi: A_{3} \\to O_{3}$ given by $\\phi(\\sigma) = \\sigma \\tau_{12}$. For every odd permutation $\\pi \\in O_{3}$, there is a unique even permutation $\\sigma \\in A_{3}$ such that $\\pi = \\sigma \\tau_{12}$.\n\nWe can therefore re-index the sum over $O_{3}$ using $\\sigma \\in A_{3}$:\n$$ \\sum_{\\pi \\in O_{3}} \\pi \\cdot T = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in A_{3}} (\\sigma \\tau_{12}) \\cdot T $$\nUsing the property that the group action is associative, $(\\sigma \\tau_{12}) \\cdot T = \\sigma \\cdot (\\tau_{12} \\cdot T)$.\n$$ \\sum_{\\pi \\in O_{3}} \\pi \\cdot T = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in A_{3}} \\sigma \\cdot (\\tau_{12} \\cdot T) $$\nNow, we use the crucial hypothesis that $T$ is symmetric in the first two slots, meaning $\\tau_{12} \\cdot T = T$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ \\sum_{\\pi \\in O_{3}} \\pi \\cdot T = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in A_{3}} \\sigma \\cdot T $$\nThis shows that the sum over the odd permutations is identical to the sum over the even permutations.\n\nFinally, substitute this result back into the expression for $\\operatorname{Alt}(T)$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Alt}(T) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\sum_{\\sigma \\in A_{3}} \\sigma \\cdot T - \\sum_{\\sigma \\in A_{3}} \\sigma \\cdot T \\right) = \\frac{1}{6} (0) = 0 $$\nThis rigorously proves that for any tensor $T \\in V^{\\otimes 3}$ that is symmetric in its first two slots, its alternation $\\operatorname{Alt}(T)$ is the zero tensor. This is a fundamental result connecting symmetry and antisymmetry: the process of antisymmetrizing a tensor that possesses a symmetry between two of its slots results in zero.\n\nThe value of the alternation of the constructed tensor $T$ is therefore the zero element of the space $\\Lambda^{3}V$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3034058"}, {"introduction": "Our exploration culminates with the sophisticated machinery used to handle tensors that are neither fully symmetric nor fully alternating, but possess a 'mixed' symmetry.

We compute this product in the group algebra $\\mathbb{R}[S_3]$:\n$$y = (id + (12))(id - (13)) = id \\cdot id - id \\cdot (13) + (12) \\cdot id - (12) \\cdot (13)$$\n$$y = id + (12) - (13) - (12)(13)$$\nThe composition of permutations is performed from right to left.
