Let $q=(0,0,1)$ be the north pole. The manifold in question is $M = S^2 \\setminus \\{q\\}$ with the induced metric $g|_M$ and the corresponding intrinsic distance $d_M$.\n\n#### Metric Incompleteness\n\nTo prove that the metric space $(M, d_M)$ is incomplete, we must construct a Cauchy sequence of points in $M$ that does not converge to a point in $M$.\n\nConsider the great circle on $S^2$ lying in the $xz$-plane. We can define a sequence of points $\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ along this great circle that approaches the north pole $q$. Let the points be defined in spherical coordinates by colatitude $\\phi_n = \\frac{1}{n}$ and longitude $\\theta=0$. In Cartesian coordinates, this corresponds to:\n$$\nx_n = \\left(\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\cos(0), \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\sin(0), \\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right), 0, \\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nFor each $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, $\\frac{1}{n} \\in (0, \\pi]$, so $\\sin(1/n) \\neq 0$ unless $1/n=\\pi$, which is not the case for integer $n$. The point $x_n$ is the north pole $q=(0,0,1)$ only if its colatitude is $0$. Since $\\frac{1}{n}  0$ for all $n \\ge 1$, $x_n \\neq q$, and thus $x_n \\in M$ for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $\\frac{1}{n} \\to 0$. By the continuity of sine and cosine functions, we have:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n = \\left(\\sin(0), 0, \\cos(0)\\right) = (0,0,1) = q\n$$\nSince the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to $q$ in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and $q \\notin M$, the sequence cannot converge to any point within $M$.\n\nNext, we show that $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence with respect to the metric $d_M$. The distance $d_M(x_n, x_m)$ is the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise $C^1$ paths in $M$ connecting $x_n$ and $x_m$. The ambient space $(S^2, g)$ is a complete Riemannian manifold. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, the distance $d_{S^2}(x_n, x_m)$ is realized by the length of a minimizing geodesic. On the unit sphere, this distance is the angle between the position vectors, given by $d_{S^2}(u, v) = \\arccos(u \\cdot v)$. The points $x_n$ and $x_m$ both lie on the arc of the great circle in the $xz$-plane connecting the equator to the north pole. The unique minimizing geodesic in $S^2$ between $x_n$ and $x_m$ is the segment of this great circle connecting them. This segment does not contain the north pole $q$. Thus, this minimizing geodesic is a path entirely contained within $M$. Consequently, the intrinsic distance in $M$ is the same as the distance in $S^2$:\n$$\nd_M(x_n, x_m) = d_{S^2}(x_n, x_m)\n$$\nThe distance is the difference in their geodesic parameter (colatitude):\n$$\nd_{S^2}(x_n, x_m) = \\left| \\phi_n - \\phi_m \\right| = \\left| \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{m} \\right|\n$$\nThe sequence of real numbers $\\{1/n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence. For any $\\epsilon  0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $n, m  N$, we have $|1/n - 1/m|  \\epsilon$. This implies that for any $\\epsilon  0$, there exists $N$ such that for all $n, m  N$, $d_M(x_n, x_m)  \\epsilon$. Therefore, $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(M, d_M)$.\n\nWe have constructed a Cauchy sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ in $(M, d_M)$ that does not converge to a point in $M$. By definition, $(M, d_M)$ is not a complete metric space.\n\n#### Geodesic Incompleteness\n\nThe Hopf-Rinow theorem states that for a connected Riemannian manifold, metric completeness is equivalent to geodesic completeness. Since we have shown that $(M, d_M)$ is not metrically complete, it follows that $(M, g|_M)$ is not geodesically complete.\n\nTo explicitly demonstrate this, we must exhibit a geodesic in $M$ that cannot be extended for all parameter time in $M$. Geodesics on $(S^2, g)$ are great circles. Consider the great circle in the $xz$-plane, parameterized by arc length $t$:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, 0, \\sin t)\n$$\nThe velocity vector is $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, 0, \\cos t)$, and its norm is $|\\gamma'(t)| = \\sqrt{(-\\sin t)^2 + 0^2 + (\\cos t)^2} = 1$. Thus, $\\gamma(t)$ is a unit-speed geodesic in $(S^2, g)$.\n\nThis geodesic passes through the north pole $q=(0,0,1)$ when $\\sin t = 1$, which occurs at $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$.\nLet's consider the geodesic starting at the point $(1,0,0)$ at $t=0$ and moving towards $q$. This is the curve $\\gamma: [0, \\infty) \\to S^2$. As a curve in $M$, its domain must exclude any $t$ for which $\\gamma(t)=q$. Let's focus on the segment $\\alpha(t) = \\gamma(t)$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi/2)$. The curve $\\alpha: [0, \\pi/2) \\to M$ is a geodesic in $M$ since for any $t_0 \\in [0, \\pi/2)$, there is a neighborhood of $t_0$ where $\\alpha(t)$ is a geodesic in $S^2$ and remains in $M$. The length of this geodesic path is finite, $L(\\alpha) = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} |\\alpha'(t)| dt = \\pi/2$.\n\nAs $t \\to (\\pi/2)^-$, the point $\\alpha(t)$ approaches $q$. The geodesic $\\alpha$ cannot be extended to the parameter value $t=\\pi/2$ (or any larger value) *as a curve in M*, because its limit point $\\lim_{t\\to\\pi/2} \\alpha(t) = q$ is not in $M$. A geodesically complete manifold requires every geodesic to be extendable for all time $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since we have found a maximal geodesic defined on a finite interval $[0, \\pi/2)$, the manifold $(M, g|_M)$ is not geodesically complete.\n\n### Part 2: Computation of $\\overline{d}(p,q)$\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of $\\overline{d}(p,q)$ for the point $p = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\in M$, where\n$$\n\\overline{d}(p,q) := \\inf\\left\\{L_{g}(\\gamma) : \\gamma \\text{ is piecewise } C^{1} \\text{ in } M,\\ \\gamma(0)=p,\\ \\text{and there exists a sequence } \\{y_{k}\\} \\subset \\operatorname{Im}(\\gamma) \\text{ with } y_{k} \\to q \\text{ in } \\mathbb{R}^{3}\\right\\}.\n$$\nThe definition describes the infimum of lengths of all paths in $M$ that start at $p$ and get arbitrarily close to $q$. This is precisely the definition of the distance between $p$ and $q$ in the metric completion of $(M, d_M)$. The metric completion of the punctured sphere $(M, d_M)$ is the complete sphere $(S^2, d_{S^2})$. Therefore, the quantity $\\overline{d}(p,q)$ is equal to the standard intrinsic distance $d_{S^2}(p,q)$ on the complete sphere $S^2$.\n\nWe can formalize this argument.\n1. Let $\\gamma_{min}$ be a minimizing geodesic in $S^2$ connecting $p$ to $q$. Since $S^2$ is complete, such a geodesic exists. Its length is $L_g(\\gamma_{min}) = d_{S^2}(p,q)$. Consider the path $\\gamma_0$ which is $\\gamma_{min}$ truncated just before its endpoint $q$. This path lies entirely in $M$, starts at $p$, and has a sequence of points on its image that converges to $q$. The length of $\\gamma_0$ is $d_{S^2}(p,q)$. Since $\\gamma_0$ is one of the paths in the set over which the infimum is taken, we must have $\\overline{d}(p,q) \\le L_g(\\gamma_0) = d_{S^2}(p,q)$.\n\n2. Let $\\gamma$ be any piecewise $C^1$ path in $M$ starting at $p$ and approaching $q$. We can view this path as a path in the larger space $S^2$ which starts at $p$ and \"ends\" at $q$. The length of any such path must be greater than or equal to the length of the shortest path (the minimizing geodesic) between $p$ and $q$ in $S^2$. Thus, $L_g(\\gamma) \\ge d_{S^2}(p,q)$. Since this is true for all such paths $\\gamma$, the infimum of their lengths must also satisfy this inequality: $\\overline{d}(p,q) = \\inf\\{L_g(\\gamma)\\} \\ge d_{S^2}(p,q)$.\n\nCombining both inequalities, we conclude that $\\overline{d}(p,q) = d_{S^2}(p,q)$.\n\nThe distance between two points $u, v$ on the unit sphere $S^2$ is the great-circle distance, given by the angle between their position vectors:\n$$\nd_{S^2}(u,v) = \\arccos(u \\cdot v)\n$$\nWe need to calculate this for $p = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$ and $q=(0,0,1)$.\nFirst, we compute the dot product:\n$$\np \\cdot q = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(0) + (0)(0) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the distance:\n$$\n\\overline{d}(p,q) = d_{S^2}(p,q) = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe principal value of the arccosine of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$.

For this manifold $(M,g)$, the Christoffel symbols are all zero, which means the geodesics are straight lines, just as in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The Riemannian distance $d_g(p,q)$ between two points $p, q \\in M$ is the length of the shortest path between them that lies entirely within $M$. Since $M$ is a convex set, the straight line segment connecting any two points $p, q \\in M$ is contained in $M$. This straight line is the unique geodesic between $p$ and $q$, and its length is the Euclidean distance $\\|p-q\\|$. Therefore, the induced distance function $d_g$ is identical to the standard Euclidean distance on $M$.\n\nFirst, we address the task of showing that $(M,g)$ is not complete. We must exhibit a unit-speed geodesic that leaves $M$ in finite time and use this to show the failure of metric completeness as per the provided definitions.\nLet us consider a geodesic starting at the origin $p_0 = 0 \\in M$. A unit-speed geodesic starting from the origin can be parametrized as $\\gamma(t) = t v$, where $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a unit vector, i.e., $\\|v\\|=1$. For definiteness, we can choose $v = e_1 = (1, 0, \\dots, 0)$. The geodesic is then $\\gamma(t) = t e_1$. This path is a straight line. The condition for the path to be within $M$ is $\\|\\gamma(t)\\|  1$. We have $\\|\\gamma(t)\\| = \\|t e_1\\| = |t| \\|e_1\\| = |t|$. Thus, the geodesic is contained in $M$ for $t \\in (-1, 1)$. At $t=1$, the geodesic reaches the point $e_1$, for which $\\|e_1\\|=1$. This point lies on the boundary of $M$ and is therefore not in $M$. Similarly, at $t=-1$, it reaches $-e_1 \\notin M$. The maximal interval of definition for this geodesic is $(-1, 1)$, which is not all of $\\mathbb{R}$. This demonstrates that $(M,g)$ is not geodesically complete.\nTo show this implies metric incompleteness, consider the sequence of points $p_k = \\gamma(1 - \\frac{1}{k}) = (1 - \\frac{1}{k})e_1$ for integer $k \\ge 2$. Each point $p_k$ is in $M$ since $\\|p_k\\| = 1 - \\frac{1}{k}  1$. Let's check if this sequence is a Cauchy sequence with respect to $d_g$. For any integers $k, j \\ge 2$, the distance is:\n$$d_g(p_k, p_j) = \\|p_k - p_j\\| = \\left\\|\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k}\\right)e_1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{j}\\right)e_1\\right\\| = \\left|\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{j}\\right)\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1}{j} - \\frac{1}{k}\\right|$$\nAs $k,j \\to \\infty$, this distance approaches $0$. Thus, $\\{p_k\\}_{k\\ge2}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(M, d_g)$. However, the limit of this sequence in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} p_k = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} (1 - \\frac{1}{k})e_1 = e_1$. The point $e_1$ is not in $M$ because $\\|e_1\\|=1$. Therefore, the Cauchy sequence $\\{p_k\\}$ does not converge to a point within $M$. By the definition of metric completeness, $(M,g)$ is not a complete metric space.\n\nNext, we construct a subset $S \\subset M$ that is closed in $M$ and bounded with respect to $d_g$, but is not compact. A key consequence of a metric space not being complete is that the Heine-Borel property (a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded) fails. We will construct such a set $S$ that \"reaches for\" the boundary of $M$ at two opposite points. Let $e_1$ be the first standard basis vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We define the set $S$ as:\n$$S = \\{ x e_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid x \\in (-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1) \\}$$\nLet's verify the properties of $S$:\n1.  **$S$ is bounded with respect to $d_g$**: For any point $p = x e_1 \\in S$, we have $|x|  1$, so $\\|p\\| = |x|  1$. The set $S$ is contained within the unit ball, and its diameter is finite (as we will compute), so it is bounded.\n2.  **$S$ is closed in $M$**: A set $A \\subset M$ is closed in the subspace topology of $M$ if $A = \\bar{A} \\cap M$, where $\\bar{A}$ is the closure of $A$ in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. For our set $S$, its closure in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ includes the limit points. The set of scalar values is a union of two intervals, so its closure is $\\bar{I} = [-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$. The closure of $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is thus $\\bar{S} = \\{ x e_1 \\mid x \\in \\bar{I} \\}$. We find the intersection of $\\bar{S}$ with $M$:\n    $$\\bar{S} \\cap M = \\{ p \\in \\bar{S} \\mid \\|p\\|  1 \\} = \\{ x e_1 \\mid x \\in \\bar{I} \\text{ and } \\|x e_1\\|  1 \\}$$\n    The condition $\\|x e_1\\| = |x|  1$ applied to $x \\in [-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$ excludes the endpoints $x=-1$ and $x=1$. This leaves the set of values $(-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1)$, which is the original set of scalars defining $S$. Thus, $\\bar{S} \\cap M = S$, which proves that $S$ is a closed set in $M$.\n3.  **$S$ is not compact**: We demonstrate this by showing $S$ is not sequentially compact. Consider the sequence $\\{q_k\\}_{k\\ge2}$ given by $q_k = (1 - \\frac{1}{k})e_1$. Every point $q_k$ is in $S$ since $\\frac{1}{2} \\le 1 - \\frac{1}{k}  1$ for $k \\ge 2$. This sequence converges to $e_1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Since any subsequence of $\\{q_k\\}$ must also converge to $e_1$, and $e_1 \\notin M$, no subsequence of $\\{q_k\\}$ can converge to a limit inside $M$. Therefore, we have found a sequence in $S$ that has no convergent subsequence with a limit in $M$. This shows $S$ is not sequentially compact and hence not compact.\n\nFinally, we compute the diameter of our constructed set $S$ with respect to the induced Riemannian distance $d_g$. The diameter is defined as $\\operatorname{diam}(S) = \\sup_{p,q \\in S} d_g(p,q)$.\nAs established, $d_g(p,q) = \\|p-q\\|$. Let $p = x e_1$ and $q = y e_1$ be two points in $S$, where $x, y \\in (-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. The distance between them is:\n$$d_g(p,q) = \\|x e_1 - y e_1\\| = \\|(x-y)e_1\\| = |x-y|$$\nWe need to find the supremum of $|x-y|$ for all possible choices of $x$ and $y$ from the set $I = (-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. The distance $|x-y|$ is maximized when $x$ and $y$ are chosen from the opposite ends of the interval set $I$. We want to find:\n$$\\operatorname{diam}(S) = \\sup_{x, y \\in I} |x-y|$$\nThis is equivalent to $\\sup(I) - \\inf(I)$.\nThe supremum of the set $I$ is:\n$$\\sup\\left( (-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1) \\right) = 1$$\nThe infimum of the set $I$ is:\n$$\\inf\\left( (-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1) \\right) = -1$$\nThe diameter of $S$ is therefore:\n$$\\operatorname{diam}(S) = 1 - (-1) = 2$$\nThe diameter of the set $S$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2972388"}, {"introduction": "Incompleteness is not always caused by obvious topological features like punctures or missing boundaries.

The Christoffel symbol $\\Gamma^{1}_{11}$ is:\n$$ \\Gamma^{1}_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}g_{11}}{\\mathrm{d}r} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g_{11}}{\\mathrm{d}r} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g_{11}}{\\mathrm{d}r}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g_{11}}{\\mathrm{d}r} $$\nThe derivative of the metric component is:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g_{11}}{\\mathrm{d}r} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}r}(r^{-4}) = -4 r^{-5} $$\nSubstituting this into the formula for $\\Gamma^{1}_{11}$:\n$$ \\Gamma^{1}_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} (r^{4})(-4 r^{-5}) = -2 r^{-1} = -\\frac{2}{r} $$\nThus, the geodesic equation is:\n$$ \\ddot{r} - \\frac{2}{r}\\dot{r}^{2} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\dot{r} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}t}$ and $\\ddot{r} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}r}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}}$.\n\nNext, we impose the unit-speed condition. The squared speed of the curve $r(t)$ is given by $v^{2} = g_{rr}(\\dot{r})^{2}$. For a unit-speed geodesic, $v^{2}=1$:\n$$ r^{-4} \\dot{r}^{2} = 1 $$\nThis implies $\\dot{r}^{2} = r^{4}$, and therefore $\\dot{r} = \\pm r^{2}$. The problem states that the initial velocity points toward increasing $r$, which means $\\dot{r}(0)  0$. Evaluating at $t=0$, we have $\\dot{r}(0) = \\pm r(0)^{2} = \\pm r_{0}^{2}$. Since $r_{0}  1$, $r_{0}^{2}$ is positive. To satisfy $\\dot{r}(0)  0$, we must choose the positive sign. Thus, the velocity of the geodesic is governed by the first-order differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}t} = r^{2} $$\nThis equation must hold for all $t$ for which the geodesic is defined, as the speed of a geodesic is constant. We can verify that any solution to $\\dot{r} = r^{2}$ satisfies the geodesic equation. Differentiating $\\dot{r} = r^{2}$ with respect to $t$ gives $\\ddot{r} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(r^{2}) = 2r \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 2r\\dot{r}$. Substituting $\\ddot{r}=2r\\dot{r}$ and $\\dot{r}^2 = r^4$ into the geodesic equation:\n$$ (2r\\dot{r}) - \\frac{2}{r}(\\dot{r})^{2} = 2r(r^2) - \\frac{2}{r}(r^4) = 2r^3 - 2r^3 = 0 $$\nThe equation is satisfied.\n\nWe now solve the ordinary differential equation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}t} = r^{2}$ with the initial condition $r(0) = r_{0}$. This is a separable equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{r^{2}} = \\mathrm{d}t $$\nIntegrating from the initial state $(0, r_{0})$ to $(t, r(t))$:\n$$ \\int_{r_{0}}^{r(t)} \\frac{1}{\\rho^{2}} \\,\\mathrm{d}\\rho = \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathrm{d}\\tau $$\n$$ \\left[-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\right]_{r_{0}}^{r(t)} = \\left[\\tau\\right]_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{r(t)} + \\frac{1}{r_{0}} = t $$\nSolving for $r(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r(t)} = \\frac{1}{r_{0}} - t = \\frac{1 - r_{0}t}{r_{0}} $$\n$$ r(t) = \\frac{r_{0}}{1 - r_{0}t} $$\nThis is the explicit solution for the unit-speed geodesic starting at $r_{0}$ with positive initial velocity.\n\n#### 2. Demonstration of Geodesic Incompleteness\nThe geodesic $r(t) = \\frac{r_{0}}{1 - r_{0}t}$ is defined for $t \\ge 0$. The expression for $r(t)$ has a singularity when the denominator is zero, which occurs at $t = \\frac{1}{r_{0}}$. Since $r_{0}  1$, this is a finite positive time.\n\nAs $t$ approaches this value from below, $t \\to (\\frac{1}{r_{0}})^{-}$, the denominator $1 - r_{0}t$ approaches $0$ from the positive side. Since the numerator $r_{0}$ is positive, we have:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to (1/r_{0})^{-}} r(t) = +\\infty $$\nThis shows that the particle traveling along the geodesic \"escapes to infinity\" in the finite parameter time $T = \\frac{1}{r_{0}}$.\n\nAny compact subset $K$ of $M = (1, \\infty)$ is bounded, meaning there exists a real number $B  1$ such that for all $p \\in K$, $p \\le B$. Since $r(t) \\to \\infty$ as $t \\to T$, for any such $B$, there exists a time $t_{B}  T$ such that for all $t \\in (t_{B}, T)$, $r(t)  B$. This means the geodesic leaves the set $K$ and does not return. Therefore, the geodesic leaves every compact subset of $M$.\n\nA Riemannian manifold is defined as geodesically complete if every geodesic can be extended for all time, i.e., its parameter domain can be taken to be $\\mathbb{R}$. We have found a geodesic that is defined only on a finite time interval $[0, \\frac{1}{r_{0}})$. The existence of such a maximally defined geodesic over a finite parameter interval demonstrates that the manifold $(M,g)$ is geodesically incomplete.\n\nThe finite escape time $T$ is the supremum of the parameter values $t \\ge 0$ for which the geodesic $r(t)$ remains in $M$. The domain of definition for the geodesic starting at $t=0$ is the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{r_{0}})$. The supremum of this interval is:\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{r_{0}} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{r_{0}}}$$", "id": "2972408"}]}
