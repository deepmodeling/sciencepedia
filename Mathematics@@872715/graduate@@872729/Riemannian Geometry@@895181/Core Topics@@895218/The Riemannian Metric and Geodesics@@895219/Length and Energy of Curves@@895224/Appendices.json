The right side becomes $(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{\\ell_i^2}{\\tau_i}) (\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\tau_i)$.\nUsing the energy expression $E(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{\\ell_i^2}{\\tau_i}$ and the constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\tau_i = T$, the inequality becomes:\n$$L^2 \\leq (2 E(\\gamma)) (T)$$\nRearranging for the energy, we obtain a lower bound:\n$$E(\\gamma) \\geq \\frac{L^2}{2T}$$\nThe minimum energy $E_{min}$ is this lower bound, provided it is achievable. The equality in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds if and only if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other, i.e., $\\mathbf{a} = c \\mathbf{b}$ for some constant $c$. This means $\\frac{\\ell_i}{\\sqrt{\\tau_i}} = c \\sqrt{\\tau_i}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, k$.\nThis condition simplifies to $\\ell_i = c \\tau_i$, or $\\frac{\\ell_i}{\\tau_i} = c$. Since $v_i = \\ell_i/\\tau_i$, this implies that the speed $v_i$ must be constant for all segments, i.e., $v_i = v$ for all $i$. The optimal parameterization corresponds to traversing the curve at a constant speed.\n\nWe can determine this constant speed $v$ using the total time constraint:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\tau_i = T \\implies \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{\\ell_i}{v} = T \\implies \\frac{1}{v} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\ell_i = T \\implies \\frac{L}{v} = T$$\nThis gives the optimal speed as $v = L/T$, the average speed over the whole curve. The optimal time allocation for each segment is then $\\tau_i^* = \\frac{\\ell_i}{v} = \\frac{\\ell_i T}{L} = \\frac{\\ell_i T}{\\sum_{j=1}^k \\ell_j}$.\nSubstituting these optimal durations back into the energy formula is not necessary, as we know the minimum value is given by the equality condition in our derived inequality. The minimal energy is:\n$$E_{min} = \\frac{L^2}{2T} = \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\ell_i\\right)^2}{2T}$$\n\nTo explain how redistributing time affects the total energy, we analyze the energy expression $E(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{\\ell_i^2}{\\tau_i}$. The energy contribution from each segment, $E_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\ell_i^2/\\tau_i$, is inversely proportional to the time $\\tau_i$ spent on that segment. For a segment of fixed length $\\ell_i$, traveling faster (decreasing $\\tau_i$) significantly increases the energy cost for that segment, while traveling slower (increasing $\\tau_i$) reduces it.\nThe function $f(\\tau) = 1/\\tau$ is a strictly convex function for $\\tau  0$. The total energy is a sum of these convex functions with positive coefficients $(\\ell_i^2/2)$, so $E(\\{\\tau_i\\})$ is a strictly convex function of the time allocations $\\{\\tau_i\\}$. Jensen's inequality (or simply the property of convexity) implies that \"averaging\" leads to a lower value. Any deviation from the optimal uniform-speed configuration (where $\\tau_i$ is proportional to $\\ell_i$) involves speeding up on some segments (decreasing their $\\tau_i$) and slowing down on others (increasing their $\\tau_i$) to keep the sum $\\sum \\tau_i = T$ constant. Due to the convexity, the energy penalty incurred from the segments that are sped up is greater than the energy savings from the segments that are slowed down. Thus, any non-uniform speed profile results in a higher total energy than the constant speed profile, which achieves the minimum energy. This is precisely what the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality demonstrates: the minimum is achieved only when the speeds are equalized across all segments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\ell_i\\right)^{2}}{2T}}$$", "id": "2982927"}]}
