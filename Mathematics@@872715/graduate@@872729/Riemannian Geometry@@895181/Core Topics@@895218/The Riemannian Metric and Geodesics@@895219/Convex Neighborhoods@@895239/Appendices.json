The definitions and properties provided are standard in Riemannian geometry. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe $n$-dimensional sphere $S^n$ is a homogeneous space; its group of isometries (the orthogonal group $O(n+1)$) acts transitively. This means that the local geometry is the same at every point. Consequently, the injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ and the convexity radius $r_{c}(p)$ are constant for all points $p \\in S^n$. We can, without loss of generality, choose $p$ to be a specific point, such as the \"north pole\" in the standard embedding in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\n**1. Determination of the Injectivity Radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$**\n\nThe injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ is the distance from $p$ to its cut locus. The cut locus of $p$ is the set of points $q$ for which there is more than one minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$, or the set of points where geodesics starting at $p$ cease to be minimizing.\n\nThe problem states that geodesics on $S^n$ are great circles. A great circle is the intersection of the sphere with a $2$-dimensional plane passing through the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $p \\in S^n$ be our chosen point. Any geodesic starting at $p$ is an arc of a great circle passing through $p$.\n\nAll great circles passing through $p$ intersect again at a single common point: the antipodal point to $p$, which we denote as $-p$. The distance between $p$ and $-p$ along any such great circle is half the circumference of the circle. Since $S^n$ is a unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, all great circles are unit circles in their respective planes and thus have a circumference of $2\\pi$. The distance along the sphere is the arc length. Therefore, the distance from $p$ to its antipodal point $-p$ is $d(p, -p) = \\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi) = \\pi$.\n\nFor any point $q \\in S^n$ except $-p$, there is a unique shortest geodesic from $p$ to $q$. At the point $q = -p$, all geodesics starting from $p$ reconverge. Thus, there are infinitely many minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $-p$, each of length $\\pi$. The cut locus of $p$ consists of the single point $\\{-p\\}$.\n\nThe injectivity radius is the distance from $p$ to its cut locus.\n$$\n\\operatorname{inj}(p) = d(p, \\text{cut locus}(p)) = d(p, -p) = \\pi\n$$\nThe exponential map $\\exp_p: B_r(0) \\subset T_p S^n \\to S^n$ is a diffeomorphism for any radius $r  \\pi$. For $r=\\pi$, all vectors on the boundary of the ball $B_\\pi(0)$ in $T_p S^n$ are mapped to the same point $-p$, so the map is not injective. The supremum of such radii is $\\pi$.\n\n**2. Determination of the Convexity Radius $r_c(p)$**\n\nThe convexity radius $r_c(p)$ is the supremum of radii $r  0$ such that for any two points $q_1, q_2$ in the open geodesic ball $B_r(p)$, the unique minimizing geodesic joining them is entirely contained within $B_r(p)$. An open geodesic ball is defined as $B_r(p) = \\{q \\in S^n \\mid d(p, q)  r \\}$. The condition for the geodesic segment $\\gamma$ connecting $q_1$ and $q_2$ to be in $B_r(p)$ is $d(p, \\gamma(t))  r$ for all $t$ in its domain.\n\nFirst, for any two points in $B_r(p)$ to be joined by a unique minimizing geodesic, the ball cannot contain any pair of antipodal points. The diameter of $B_r(p)$ is $2r$. Thus, we must have $2r  \\pi$, or $r  \\pi/2$. This provides an initial upper bound on $r_c(p)$.\n\nWe will analyze the convexity of $B_r(p)$ in two cases.\n\n**Case 1: $r \\le \\pi/2$**\nLet $q_1, q_2 \\in B_r(p)$. This means $d(p, q_1)  r$ and $d(p, q_2)  r$. Since $r \\le \\pi/2$, we have $d(p, q_1)  \\pi/2$ and $d(p, q_2)  \\pi/2$. In the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, this means $\\langle p, q_1 \\rangle = \\cos(d(p, q_1))  \\cos(r) \\ge 0$ and $\\langle p, q_2 \\rangle = \\cos(d(p, q_2))  \\cos(r) \\ge 0$.\n\nLet $\\gamma(t)$ be the unit-speed minimizing geodesic from $q_1$ to $q_2$ of length $L = d(q_1, q_2)$, with $\\gamma(0)=q_1$ and $\\gamma(L)=q_2$. Any point on the minimal geodesic arc is a convex combination of $q_1$ and $q_2$ in a specific sense (e.g., spherical linear interpolation). This implies that if $\\langle p, q_1 \\rangle  0$ and $\\langle p, q_2 \\rangle  0$, then for any point $\\gamma(t)$ on the minimal arc, we also have $\\langle p, \\gamma(t) \\rangle  0$. This means the entire geodesic segment is contained in the open hemisphere centered at $p$, i.e., $d(p, \\gamma(t))  \\pi/2$.\n\nTo show the more specific condition $d(p, \\gamma(t))  r$, we use the provided property that for a geodesic $\\gamma$, the function $h(t) = \\langle p, \\gamma(t) \\rangle$ satisfies the differential equation $h''(t) + h(t) = 0$. Since we have established that $h(t)  0$ for all $t \\in [0, L]$, the equation $h''(t) = -h(t)$ implies that $h''(t)  0$. The function $h(t)$ is therefore strictly concave on the interval $[0, L]$.\n\nThe minimum value of a strictly concave function on a closed interval occurs at one of the endpoints. Thus, for any $t \\in [0, L]$:\n$$\nh(t) \\ge \\min(h(0), h(L)) = \\min(\\langle p, q_1 \\rangle, \\langle p, q_2 \\rangle)\n$$\nIn terms of distances, this is:\n$$\n\\cos(d(p, \\gamma(t))) \\ge \\min(\\cos(d(p, q_1)), \\cos(d(p, q_2)))\n$$\nSince $d(p, q_1)  r$ and $d(p, q_2)  r$, and the cosine function is strictly decreasing on $[0, \\pi]$, we have $\\cos(d(p, q_1))  \\cos(r)$ and $\\cos(d(p, q_2))  \\cos(r)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\cos(d(p, \\gamma(t)))  \\cos(r)\n$$\nApplying the strictly decreasing function $\\arccos$ to both sides reverses the inequality:\n$$\nd(p, \\gamma(t))  r\n$$\nThis holds for all $t \\in [0, L]$, so the entire geodesic segment is contained in $B_r(p)$. This demonstrates that for any $r \\le \\pi/2$, the ball $B_r(p)$ is a convex set.\n\n**Case 2: $r  \\pi/2$**\nLet $r \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi)$. We will show that $B_r(p)$ is not convex by finding a pair of points $q_1, q_2 \\in B_r(p)$ for which the connecting geodesic is not fully contained in $B_r(p)$.\nConsider two points $q_1, q_2$ on the boundary of the ball, $\\partial B_r(p)$, such that $d(p, q_1) = d(p, q_2) = r$. Let $\\gamma$ be the minimizing geodesic between them of length $L=d(q_1,q_2)$. By symmetry, the point on $\\gamma$ that is furthest from $p$ is its midpoint, $m = \\gamma(L/2)$. The distance of the midpoint $m$ from $p$ is given by the formula (derived from spherical trigonometry or vector analysis):\n$$\n\\cos(d(p, m)) = \\frac{\\langle p, q_1 \\rangle + \\langle p, q_2 \\rangle}{\\|q_1+q_2\\|} = \\frac{\\cos(r) + \\cos(r)}{2\\cos(L/2)} = \\frac{\\cos(r)}{\\cos(L/2)}\n$$\nWe want to check if $d(p, m)  r$. This is equivalent to $\\cos(d(p, m))  \\cos(r)$ because $d(p,m)$ and $r$ are in $[0,\\pi]$ and $\\cos$ is decreasing. So we must check if $\\frac{\\cos(r)}{\\cos(L/2)}  \\cos(r)$.\n\nSince $r \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi)$, we have $\\cos(r)  0$. Multiplying the inequality by $\\cos(r)$ reverses the sign:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\cos(L/2)}  1\n$$\nThis would imply $\\cos(L/2)  1$, which is impossible for any real $L$. For any distinct points $q_1, q_2$, we have $L  0$, which means $\\cos(L/2)  1$. Thus, the inequality $\\frac{1}{\\cos(L/2)}  1$ is never satisfied. On the contrary, we have $\\frac{1}{\\cos(L/2)}  1$.\nThis leads to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\cos(r)}{\\cos(L/2)}  \\cos(r)\n$$\nApplying $\\arccos$ reverses the inequality again:\n$$\nd(p, m) = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\cos(r)}{\\cos(L/2)}\\right)  \\arccos(\\cos(r)) = r\n$$\nThis shows that for any two points $q_1, q_2$ on the boundary of $B_r(p)$ (with $r\\pi/2$), the midpoint of the geodesic connecting them lies outside the ball $B_r(p)$. By continuity, we can choose points just inside the open ball $B_r(p)$ whose geodesic midpoint will also lie outside $B_r(p)$. Thus, for any $r  \\pi/2$, the ball $B_r(p)$ is not convex.\n\n**Conclusion for $r_c(p)$**\nWe have shown that $B_r(p)$ is convex for all $r \\le \\pi/2$ and not convex for any $r  \\pi/2$. The supremum of such radii $r$ is therefore $\\pi/2$.\n$$\nr_c(p) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\n\n**Final Result**\nThe convexity radius is $r_c(p) = \\pi/2$ and the injectivity radius is $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\pi$.

The manifold is the cylinder $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$, where $S^1$ is a circle of circumference $C  0$. We can parametrize $S^1$ by an angle coordinate $\\theta \\in [0, C)$, representing arc length. The manifold $M$ can be described by coordinates $(\\theta, z) \\in [0, C) \\times \\mathbb{R}$. The product Riemannian metric is locally given by the metric tensor $g = d\\theta^2 + dz^2$. This metric is flat, meaning its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero.\n\nThe universal cover of $M$ is the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with the standard Euclidean metric. We can identify $M$ with the quotient space $\\mathbb{R}^2 / \\sim$, where $(x, z) \\sim (x', z')$ if and only if $x - x' = kC$ for some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $z=z'$.

The open geodesic ball $B_r(p) \\subset M$ of radius $r$ centered at $p$ is the set of points $q \\in M$ such that the geodesic distance $d(p, q)  r$.

Let's analyze these two conditions for a ball $B_r(p)$. Let $p_1, p_2$ be any two points in $B_r(p)$.\n\n1.  **Uniqueness of the Minimizing Geodesic:**\n    Let $\\tilde{p}_1$ and $\\tilde{p}_2$ be the lifts of $p_1$ and $p_2$ that lie in the disk $D_r(O)$. Let their coordinates be $\\tilde{p}_1 = (x_1, z_1)$ and $\\tilde{p}_2 = (x_2, z_2)$. The set of all lifts of $p_2$ is given by $\\{\\tilde{p}_{2,k} = (x_2 + kC, z_2) \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The distance between $p_1$ and $p_2$ is the minimal Euclidean distance between $\\tilde{p}_1$ and any lift of $p_2$:\n    $$ d(p_1, p_2) = \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\| \\tilde{p}_1 - \\tilde{p}_{2,k} \\| = \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2 - kC)^2 + (z_1 - z_2)^2} $$\n    A unique minimizing geodesic exists if and only if this minimum is achieved for a single integer $k$. A non-unique minimizing geodesic exists if the minimum is achieved for two or more different values of $k$. This occurs if $p_2$ lies on the cut locus of $p_1$.\n    Let's compare the squared distances for different $k$. The condition for non-uniqueness, e.g., for $k=0$ and $k=1$, is $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 - x_2 - C)^2$. This implies $x_1 - x_2 = -(x_1 - x_2 - C)$, which simplifies to $2(x_1 - x_2) = C$, or $x_1 - x_2 = C/2$. Similarly, multiple minima can occur if $|x_1 - x_2| = m C/2$ for some non-zero integer $m$. The smallest such separation corresponds to $|x_1 - x_2| = C/2$.\n\n    For $B_r(p)$ to be strongly convex, we must not be able to find two points $p_1, p_2 \\in B_r(p)$ for which uniqueness fails. This means for any choice of lifts $\\tilde{p}_1, \\tilde{p}_2 \\in D_r(O)$, we must have $|x_1 - x_2| \\neq C/2$. Since $\\tilde{p}_1, \\tilde{p}_2 \\in D_r(O)$, we have $\\|\\tilde{p}_1\\|  r$ and $\\|\\tilde{p}_2\\|  r$. This implies $|x_1|  r$ and $|x_2|  r$. By the triangle inequality, $|x_1 - x_2| \\le |x_1| + |x_2|  r + r = 2r$.\n    To ensure $|x_1 - x_2|  C/2$ for all pairs, we require $2r \\le C/2$, which means $r \\le C/4$. If $r \\le C/4$, then for any $\\tilde{p}_1, \\tilde{p}_2 \\in D_r(O)$, we have $|x_1-x_2|2r \\le C/2$. Since the points are in the *open* ball, we have strict inequalities $\\|\\tilde{p}_1\\|  r$ and $\\|\\tilde{p}_2\\|  r$, which means $|x_1|r$ and $|x_2|r$. This leads to $|x_1-x_2|2r \\le C/2$. Equality $|x_1-x_2|=C/2$ is not possible if $r \\le C/4$. Thus, for any $r \\le C/4$, the minimizing geodesic between any two points in $B_r(p)$ is unique.\n\n    Conversely, if $r  C/4$, we can find points in $B_r(p)$ for which uniqueness fails. Let $r = C/4 + \\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon  0$. Consider the points $p_1, p_2$ corresponding to lifts $\\tilde{p}_1 = (C/4, 0)$ and $\\tilde{p}_2 = (-C/4, 0)$. Both lifts have norm $C/4$, which is less than $r$. Thus, $p_1, p_2 \\in B_r(p)$. For this pair, $x_1 - x_2 = C/4 - (-C/4) = C/2$. This leads to two minimizing geodesics between $p_1$ and $p_2$. Therefore, for any $r  C/4$, the ball $B_r(p)$ is not strongly convex.\n    This establishes that $r_{\\ast} \\le C/4$.\n\n2.  **Containment of the Geodesic:**\n    Now we must verify that for $r \\le C/4$, the unique minimizing geodesic segment is entirely contained in $B_r(p)$. For any $p_1, p_2 \\in B_r(p)$, we have shown that the unique minimizing geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is the projection of the straight line segment $[\\tilde{p}_1, \\tilde{p}_2]$ in the universal cover, where $\\tilde{p}_1, \\tilde{p}_2 \\in D_r(O)$. Let $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = (1-t)\\tilde{p}_1 + t\\tilde{p}_2$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n    The condition that $\\gamma(t) \\in B_r(p)$ for all $t$ is equivalent to $d(p, \\gamma(t))  r$ for all $t$. This is equivalent to $\\|\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)\\|  r$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\n    The function $f(t) = \\|\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)\\|^2$ is a convex function of $t$ (a quadratic with non-negative $t^2$ coefficient). Its maximum value on the interval $[0,1]$ must be attained at one of the endpoints, $t=0$ or $t=1$.\n    $$ \\max_{t \\in [0,1]} \\|\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)\\| = \\max(\\|\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)\\|, \\|\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)\\|) = \\max(\\|\\tilde{p}_1\\|, \\|\\tilde{p}_2\\|) $$\n    Since $p_1, p_2 \\in B_r(p)$, we have $\\|\\tilde{p}_1\\|  r$ and $\\|\\tilde{p}_2\\|  r$. Therefore, $\\max(\\|\\tilde{p}_1\\|, \\|\\tilde{p}_2\\|)  r$. This proves that the entire geodesic segment $\\gamma$ is contained strictly inside $B_r(p)$.\n\nPutting these results together:\n- For any $r \\in (0, C/4]$, the ball $B_r(p)$ is strongly convex.\n- For any $r  C/4$, the ball $B_r(p)$ is not strongly convex.\n\nThe problem asks for the supremum $r_{\\ast}$ such that for all $0  r  r_{\\ast}$, the ball $B_r(p)$ is strongly convex.

The cut locus of $p=\\pi(\\tilde{p})$ consists of points $q=\\pi(\\tilde{q})$ for which there are at least two minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$. This occurs when the two paths on the sphere, from $\\tilde{p}$ to $\\tilde{q}$ and from $\\tilde{p}$ to $-\\tilde{q}$, have the same length. That is, $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q}) = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{q})$. Since $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{q}) = \\pi - d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q})$, this equality implies $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q}) = \\pi/2$. The distance from $p$ to such a point $q$ is precisely $d_M(p, q) = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q}) = \\pi/2$. So, the cut locus is at a constant distance of $\\pi/2$ from $p$, confirming that $\\operatorname{inj}(M) = \\pi/2$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Strong Convexity Radius $r^{\\ast}$**\n\nA set $U \\subset M$ is defined as strongly convex if for any two points $x, y \\in U$, there is a unique minimizing geodesic segment between $x$ and $y$, and this entire segment is contained in $U$. We seek the largest radius $r^{\\ast}  0$ such that for any $r \\in (0, r^{\\ast})$, every open geodesic ball $B(p, r)$ is strongly convex.\n\nLet's analyze the two conditions for strong convexity for an open ball $B(p, r) \\subset M$. Let $p \\in M$ be the center of the ball, and let $\\tilde{p} \\in S^n$ be a lift of $p$. For $r \\in (0, \\operatorname{inj}(M)) = (0, \\pi/2)$, the ball $B(p, r)$ in $M$ is isometric to the ball $B(\\tilde{p}, r)$ in $S^n$.\n\nLet $x, y$ be two distinct points in $B(p, r)$. Let their lifts be $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y} \\in B(\\tilde{p}, r)$. This means $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{x})  r$ and $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{y})  r$. The geodesics in $M$ from $x$ to $y$ are projections of geodesics in $S^n$ connecting a lift of $x$ to a lift of $y$. The two lifts of $y$ are $\\tilde{y}$ and $-\\tilde{y}$. So we must consider geodesics from $\\tilde{x}$ to $\\tilde{y}$ and from $\\tilde{x}$ to $-\\tilde{y}$. Their lengths are $L_1 = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y})$ and $L_2 = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, -\\tilde{y})$. The distance in $M$ is $d_M(x, y) = \\min(L_1, L_2)$.\n\n**Condition 1: Uniqueness of the minimizing geodesic.**\nFor the minimizing geodesic to be unique, we must have $L_1 \\neq L_2$, which is equivalent to $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}) \\neq \\pi/2$. We must ensure this holds for any pair of points $x, y \\in B(p, r)$.\nBy the triangle inequality in $S^n$:\n$L_1 = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}) \\le d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{p}) + d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{y})  r + r = 2r$.\nSince $x, y$ are in the open ball, the distances from the center are strictly less than $r$. The supremum of the distance between two points in an open ball of radius $r$ is $2r$. Thus, for any $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y} \\in B(\\tilde{p}, r)$, we have $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y})  2r$.\nTo guarantee uniqueness, we must prevent this distance from reaching $\\pi/2$. We must impose $2r \\le \\pi/2$, which implies $r \\le \\pi/4$.\nIf $r \\le \\pi/4$, then for any $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y} \\in B(\\tilde{p}, r)$, we have $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y})  2r \\le \\pi/2$. The strict inequality $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y})  \\pi/2$ holds, ensuring uniqueness.\nSpecifically, for $r \\le \\pi/4$, we have $L_1  \\pi/2$. Also, by the reverse triangle inequality, $L_2 = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, -\\tilde{y}) \\ge |d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{x}) - d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p},-\\tilde{y})| = |d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{x}) - (\\pi-d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p},\\tilde{y}))|$. A more useful bound is $L_2 \\ge d_{S^n}(\\tilde{q}, -\\tilde{y}) - d_{S^n}(\\tilde{q}, \\tilde{x})$ for any $\\tilde{q}$. Using $\\tilde{q}=\\tilde{p}$: $L_2 \\ge d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{y}) - d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{x}) = (\\pi - d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{y})) - d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{x})  \\pi - r - r = \\pi - 2r$.\nFor $r \\le \\pi/4$, $\\pi - 2r \\ge \\pi/2$. So $L_2  \\pi/2$ while $L_1  \\pi/2$. Thus $L_1$ is strictly smaller, and the minimizing geodesic is unique. It is the projection of the geodesic segment in $S^n$ between $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{y}$.\n\n**Condition 2: Containment of the geodesic.**\nThe unique minimizing geodesic must lie entirely within $B(p, r)$. This means its lift, the segment from $\\tilde{x}$ to $\\tilde{y}$, must lie within $B(\\tilde{p}, r)$. This is a convexity property of balls in $S^n$. A geodesic ball of radius $\\rho$ in a space of constant curvature $K=1$ is convex if $\\rho \\le \\pi/(2\\sqrt{K}) = \\pi/2$.\nSince our condition so far is $r \\le \\pi/4$, which satisfies $r  \\pi/2$, the ball $B(\\tilde{p}, r)$ in $S^n$ is convex. This means for any $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y} \\in B(\\tilde{p}, r)$, the minimizing geodesic between them is contained in $B(\\tilde{p}, r)$.\nSo, for any $r \\in (0, \\pi/4]$, both conditions for strong convexity are met for any open ball $B(p, r)$.\n\n**Finding the largest radius $r^{\\ast}$.**\nWe have shown that for any $r \\in (0, \\pi/4)$, the ball $B(p, r)$ is strongly convex. So $r^{\\ast} \\ge \\pi/4$.\nNow we must show that for any $r  \\pi/4$, there exists a ball $B(p, r)$ that is not strongly convex.\nLet $r  \\pi/4$. Choose a radius $r'$ such that $\\pi/4  r'  r$.\nLet $\\tilde{p} \\in S^n$ be a point, say the north pole. Consider two points $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}$ at spherical distance $r'$ from $\\tilde{p}$, chosen to lie on the same great circle passing through $\\tilde{p}$ but on opposite sides. For instance, if $\\tilde{p} = \\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$, we can choose $\\tilde{x} = (\\sin r') \\mathbf{e}_1 + (\\cos r') \\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$ and $\\tilde{y} = (-\\sin r') \\mathbf{e}_1 + (\\cos r') \\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$.\nThe points $x=\\pi(\\tilde{x})$ and $y=\\pi(\\tilde{y})$ are in $B(p, r)$ because $d_M(p, x) = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{x}) = r'  r$, and similarly for $y$.\nLet's find the minimizing geodesic between $x$ and $y$. We compare the lengths of the paths lifted to $S^n$:\n$L_1 = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}) = \\arccos(\\langle \\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y} \\rangle) = \\arccos(-\\sin^2 r' + \\cos^2 r') = \\arccos(\\cos(2r')) = 2r'$.\n$L_2 = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, -\\tilde{y})$. Here $-\\tilde{y} = (\\sin r') \\mathbf{e}_1 - (\\cos r') \\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$.\n$d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, -\\tilde{y}) = \\arccos(\\langle \\tilde{x}, -\\tilde{y} \\rangle) = \\arccos(\\sin^2 r' - \\cos^2 r') = \\arccos(-\\cos(2r')) = \\pi - 2r'$.\nSince we chose $r'  \\pi/4$, we have $2r'  \\pi/2$. Thus $L_1  \\pi/2$.\nConversely, $\\pi - 2r'  \\pi/2$. So $L_2  L_1$.\nThe unique minimizing geodesic between $x$ and $y$ is the projection of the geodesic segment $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ in $S^n$ from $\\tilde{x}$ to $-\\tilde{y}$.\nNow we check if this geodesic segment is contained in $B(p, r)$. This requires its lift $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ to be contained in $B(\\tilde{p}, r)$. Let's find the point on $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ that is furthest from $\\tilde{p}$. By symmetry, this will be the midpoint of $\\tilde{\\gamma}$.\nThe midpoint $\\tilde{z}$ of the geodesic arc from $\\tilde{x}$ to $-\\tilde{y}$ is proportional to $\\tilde{x} + (-\\tilde{y}) = (2 \\sin r')\\mathbf{e}_1$. Normalizing, we get $\\tilde{z} = \\mathbf{e}_1$.\nThe distance from $\\tilde{p} = \\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$ to this midpoint is $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{z}) = \\arccos(\\langle \\mathbf{e}_{n+1}, \\mathbf{e}_1 \\rangle) = \\arccos(0) = \\pi/2$.\nSo, the minimizing geodesic between $x$ and $y$ contains a point $z = \\pi(\\tilde{z})$ whose distance from $p$ is $d_M(p, z) = d_M(\\pi(\\tilde{p}), \\pi(\\tilde{z})) = \\min(d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p},\\tilde{z}), d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p},-\\tilde{z})) = \\min(\\pi/2, \\pi/2) = \\pi/2$.\nFor the geodesic to be contained in the open ball $B(p, r)$, this point $z$ must satisfy $d_M(p, z)  r$. This requires $\\pi/2  r$.\nHowever, our construction works for any $r  \\pi/4$. If we take $r$ such that $\\pi/4  r \\le \\pi/2$, we have found two points $x,y \\in B(p,r)$ whose minimizing geodesic contains a point $z$ at distance $\\pi/2$ from $p$. Since $r \\le \\pi/2$, this point $z$ is not in the open ball $B(p, r)$. Thus, the ball is not strongly convex.\nThis shows that for any $r  \\pi/4$, there is a ball of radius $r$ which is not strongly convex. Therefore, the largest radius $r^{\\ast}$ for which the property holds for all $r \\in (0, r^{\\ast})$ is $\\pi/4$.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The injectivity radius is $\\operatorname{inj}(M) = \\pi/2$.\n- The largest radius for strong convexity of open balls is $r^{\\ast} = \\pi/4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\pi}{2}  \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2972842"}]}
