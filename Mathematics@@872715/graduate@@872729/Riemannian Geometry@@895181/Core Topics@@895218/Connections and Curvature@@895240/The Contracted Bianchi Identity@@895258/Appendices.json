Derivation of the differential Bianchi identity from the Jacobi identity.\n2.  Contraction of the Bianchi identity to relate the divergence of the Ricci tensor to the gradient of the Ricci scalar.\n3.  Calculation of the divergence of the Einstein tensor.\n\n#### Part 1: Derivation of the Differential Bianchi Identity\n\nThe Jacobi identity for three operators $A$, $B$, and $C$ is $[[A,B],C] + [[B,C],A] + [[C,A],B] = 0$. We apply this identity to the covariant derivative operators $A=\\nabla_c$, $B=\\nabla_d$, and $C=\\nabla_e$ acting on an arbitrary vector field $v^b$.\n\nLet's compute the first term, $[[\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d], \\nabla_e] v^b$:\n$$\n[[\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d], \\nabla_e] v^b = [\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d](\\nabla_e v^b) - \\nabla_e([\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d] v^b)\n$$\nThe first term on the right-hand side is the commutator acting on the tensor $\\nabla_e v^b$, which we can denote as $T^b_e$. The general formula for the commutator acting on a type-$(1,1)$ tensor is $[\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d] T^b_e = R^b_{~kcd} T^k_e - R^k_{~ecd} T^b_k$. Applying this, we get:\n$$\n[\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d](\\nabla_e v^b) = R^b_{~kcd}(\\nabla_e v^k) - R^k_{~ecd}(\\nabla_k v^b)\n$$\nThe second term on the right-hand side is, using the given commutator rule:\n$$\n\\nabla_e([\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d] v^b) = \\nabla_e(R^b_{~kcd} v^k) = (\\nabla_e R^b_{~kcd}) v^k + R^b_{~kcd}(\\nabla_e v^k)\n$$\nCombining these results, the first term of the Jacobi identity is:\n$$\n[[\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d], \\nabla_e] v^b = \\left(R^b_{~kcd}(\\nabla_e v^k) - R^k_{~ecd}(\\nabla_k v^b)\\right) - \\left((\\nabla_e R^b_{~kcd}) v^k + R^b_{~kcd}(\\nabla_e v^k)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= -(\\nabla_e R^b_{~kcd}) v^k - R^k_{~ecd}(\\nabla_k v^b)\n$$\nSumming this expression over cyclic permutations of the indices $(c,d,e)$ must yield zero:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\text{cyc}(c,d,e)} [[\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d], \\nabla_e] v^b = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\left( (\\nabla_e R^b_{~kcd} + \\nabla_c R^b_{~kde} + \\nabla_d R^b_{~kec}) v^k \\right) - \\left( (R^k_{~ecd} + R^k_{~cde} + R^k_{~dec}) (\\nabla_k v^b) \\right) = 0\n$$\nThe second term in parentheses vanishes due to the first (algebraic) Bianchi identity, which for a torsion-free connection states $R^k_{~e[cd]} + R^k_{~[cd]e} + R^k_{~[de]c} = 0$, or explicitly $R^k_{~ecd} + R^k_{~cde} + R^k_{~dec} = 0$.\nTherefore, the first term must also vanish. Since this must hold for any arbitrary vector field $v^k$, its coefficient must be zero:\n$$\n\\nabla_e R^b_{~kcd} + \\nabla_c R^b_{~kde} + \\nabla_d R^b_{~kec} = 0\n$$\nThis is the differential Bianchi identity (also known as the second Bianchi identity).\n\n#### Part 2: Contraction of the Bianchi Identity\n\nWe now perform two contractions on the differential Bianchi identity to find a relation between the Ricci tensor divergence and the Ricci scalar gradient. For clarity, let's relabel the indices:\n$$\n\\nabla_k R^i_{~jlm} + \\nabla_l R^i_{~jmk} + \\nabla_m R^i_{~jkl} = 0\n$$\nFirst, we contract the indices $i$ and $l$. Setting $i=l$ and summing gives:\n$$\n\\nabla_k R^l_{~jlm} + \\nabla_l R^l_{~jmk} + \\nabla_m R^l_{~jkl} = 0\n$$\nUsing the definition of the Ricci tensor, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} \\equiv R^c_{~acb}$, and the antisymmetry of the Riemann tensor in its last two indices ($R^\\dots_{~kl} = -R^\\dots_{~lk}$), we can identify two of these terms:\n- $R^l_{~jlm} = \\operatorname{Ric}_{jm}$\n- $R^l_{~jkl} = -R^l_{~jlk} = -\\operatorname{Ric}_{jk}$\n\nSubstituting these into the contracted identity gives the once-contracted Bianchi identity:\n$$\n\\nabla_k \\operatorname{Ric}_{jm} - \\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} + \\nabla_l R^l_{~jmk} = 0\n$$\nNow, we perform a second contraction by multiplying by the inverse metric $g^{jm}$:\n$$\ng^{jm}(\\nabla_k \\operatorname{Ric}_{jm}) - g^{jm}(\\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk}) + g^{jm}(\\nabla_l R^l_{~jmk}) = 0\n$$\nWe use metric compatibility ($\\nabla_k g^{ab} = 0$) to move the metric inside the derivatives.\n- The first term becomes: $\\nabla_k (g^{jm}\\operatorname{Ric}_{jm}) = \\nabla_k R$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar.\n- The second term becomes: $-\\nabla_m (g^{jm}\\operatorname{Ric}_{jk})$. For a Levi-Civita connection, the Ricci tensor is symmetric ($\\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} = \\operatorname{Ric}_{kj}$). So, $-\\nabla_m (g^{mj}\\operatorname{Ric}_{kj}) = -\\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}^m_{~k} = -\\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk}$.\n- The third term becomes: $\\nabla_l (g^{jm}R^l_{~jmk})$. Let's examine the tensor part: $g^{jm}R^l_{~jmk} = R^{l~m}_{~~mk}$. By contracting the upper index with the third lower index, this becomes the mixed Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}^l_{~k}$. Thus, this term is $\\nabla_l \\operatorname{Ric}^l_{~k} = \\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk}$.\n\nCombining these terms, the twice-contracted Bianchi identity is:\n$$\n\\nabla_k R - \\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} - \\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{kj} = 0\n$$\nUsing the symmetry $\\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} = \\operatorname{Ric}_{kj}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla_k R - 2 \\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} = 0\n$$\nRearranging gives the desired relation:\n$$\n\\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} = \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_k R\n$$\nRelabeling indices from $(j,k)$ to $(b,a)$, we have:\n$$\n\\nabla^b \\operatorname{Ric}_{ba} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_a R\n$$\n\n#### Part 3: Divergence of the Einstein Tensor\n\nThe Einstein tensor is defined as $G_{ab} \\equiv \\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R\\,g_{ab}$. We wish to compute its divergence, $\\nabla^b G_{ab}$. We use the contravariant index $b$ to indicate contraction with the metric, i.e., $\\nabla^b = g^{bc}\\nabla_c$.\n$$\n\\nabla^b G_{ab} = \\nabla^b \\left( \\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R\\,g_{ab} \\right)\n$$\nApplying the covariant derivative and using the product rule:\n$$\n\\nabla^b G_{ab} = \\nabla^b \\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla^b(R\\,g_{ab})\n$$\n$$\n= \\nabla^b \\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (\\nabla^b R)g_{ab} + R(\\nabla^b g_{ab}) \\right)\n$$\nDue to metric compatibility, $\\nabla^b g_{ab} = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla^b G_{ab} = \\nabla^b \\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2} g_{ab} \\nabla^b R\n$$\nNote that $g_{ab}\\nabla^b R = g_{ab}g^{bc}\\nabla_c R = \\delta_a^c \\nabla_c R = \\nabla_a R$. So,\n$$\n\\nabla^b G_{ab} = \\nabla^b \\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_a R\n$$\nSince the Ricci tensor is symmetric, $\\nabla^b \\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} = \\nabla^b \\operatorname{Ric}_{ba}$. Substituting the result from Part 2:\n$$\n\\nabla^b G_{ab} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_a R\\right) - \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_a R = 0\n$$\nThe divergence of the Einstein tensor is zero. The derivation confirms that no sign ambiguities arise when the specified conventions are used consistently.\n\nThe final closed-form expression for $\\nabla^b G_{ab}$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2993785"}, {"introduction": "After establishing the theoretical origins of the identity, it is crucial to see it in action in a concrete geometric context.

The first Bianchi identity: $R(X,Y,Z,W) + R(Y,Z,X,W) + R(Z,X,Y,W) = 0$.\n\nA general tensor possessing these symmetries on an $n$-dimensional space for $n \\ge 3$ is uniquely determined by the sectional curvatures of all $2$-planes at a point. For a space of constant sectional curvature, there is a unique candidate tensor, up to scaling. Let us propose the following form for the Riemann tensor:\n$$\nR(X,Y,Z,W) = C \\left( g(X,W)g(Y,Z) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) \\right),\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant to be determined. In index notation, this is $R_{abcd} = C(g_{ad}g_{bc} - g_{ac}g_{bd})$. We must verify that this tensor satisfies the required symmetries and yields the correct sectional curvature.\n\nLet's check the symmetries for the proposed tensor $T(X,Y,Z,W) = g(X,W)g(Y,Z) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W)$:\n1. $T(Y,X,Z,W) = g(Y,W)g(X,Z) - g(Y,Z)g(X,W) = -T(X,Y,Z,W)$. (Skew in first two slots)\n2. $T(X,Y,W,Z) = g(X,Z)g(Y,W) - g(X,W)g(Y,Z) = -T(X,Y,Z,W)$. (Skew in last two slots)\n3. $T(Z,W,X,Y) = g(Z,Y)g(W,X) - g(Z,X)g(W,Y) = g(Y,Z)g(X,W) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) = T(X,Y,Z,W)$.

Now we determine the constant $C$ by substituting it into the definition of sectional curvature.\n$$\nR(X,Y,Y,X) = C \\left( g(X,X)g(Y,Y) - g(X,Y)g(Y,X) \\right).\n$$\nComparing this with the given relation $R(X,Y,Y,X) = K \\left( g(X,X)g(Y,Y) - g(X,Y)^2 \\right)$, and noting that $g(Y,X)=g(X,Y)$, we see that $C=K$.\n\nThus, the Riemann curvature tensor for a space of constant sectional curvature $K$ is given by\n$$\nR(X,Y,Z,W) = K \\left( g(X,W)g(Y,Z) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) \\right).\n$$\nIn component form, this is\n$$\nR_{abcd} = K \\left( g_{ad}g_{bc} - g_{ac}g_{bd} \\right).\n$$\n\nPart 2: Ricci tensor and scalar curvature.\n\nThe Ricci tensor $R_{ab}$ is obtained by contracting the Riemann tensor. The specific contraction convention can vary, but any standard choice will lead to the same final result for Part 3. We adopt the convention $R_{ab} = R^c_{acb}$, which in component form is $R_{ab} = g^{cd}R_{adcb}$.\nUsing the expression for $R_{abcd}$ from Part 1, we first find $R_{adcb}$:\n$$\nR_{adcb} = K \\left( g_{ab}g_{dc} - g_{ac}g_{db} \\right).\n$$\nNow we contract with $g^{cd}$:\n$$\nR_{ab} = g^{cd} R_{adcb} = g^{cd} K \\left( g_{ab}g_{dc} - g_{ac}g_{db} \\right) = K \\left( g_{ab} (g^{cd}g_{dc}) - (g^{cd}g_{ac})g_{db} \\right).\n$$\nWe evaluate the two metric contractions:\n- $g^{cd}g_{dc} = \\delta^c_c = n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the manifold.\n- $g^{cd}g_{ac} = \\delta^d_a$.\n\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $R_{ab}$:\n$$\nR_{ab} = K \\left( g_{ab} \\cdot n - \\delta^d_a g_{db} \\right) = K (n g_{ab} - g_{ab}) = (n-1)K g_{ab}.\n$$\nThe Ricci tensor is $R_{ab} = (n-1)K g_{ab}$.\n\nThe scalar curvature $R$ is found by contracting the Ricci tensor with the inverse metric:\n$$\nR = g^{ab}R_{ab} = g^{ab} \\left( (n-1)K g_{ab} \\right) = (n-1)K (g^{ab}g_{ab}).\n$$\nThe contraction $g^{ab}g_{ab} = \\delta^a_a = n$.

A convenient form of the second Bianchi identity is:\n$$\\nabla_k R^l{}_{mij} + \\nabla_m R^l{}_{ijk} + \\nabla_i R^l{}_{jkm} = 0$$\nWe contract this identity over the indices $l$ and $j$:\n$$\\nabla_k R^l{}_{mil} + \\nabla_m R^l{}_{ikl} + \\nabla_i R^l{}_{lkm} = 0$$\nUsing the definition of the Ricci tensor $R_{ab} = R^c{}_{acb}$, we can identify the contracted terms:\n-   $R^l{}_{mil} = R_{mi}$\n-   $R^l{}_{ikl} = R_{ik}$\n-   $R^l{}_{lkm} = R_{km}$\nSubstituting these into the contracted identity gives:\n$$\\nabla_k R_{mi} + \\nabla_m (-R_{ik}) + \\nabla_i R_{km} = 0$$\nHere we used the antisymmetry property $R^l{}_{ikl} = -R^l{}_{kil}$, and $R^l{}_{kil} = R_{ki}$. Due to the symmetry of the Ricci tensor for a Levi-Civita connection ($R_{ki} = R_{ik}$), this leads to $\\nabla_k R_{mi} - \\nabla_m R_{ik} + \\nabla_i R_{km} = 0$.\n\nNow, we contract this equation with the inverse metric $g^{ik}$:\n$$g^{ik}(\\nabla_k R_{mi} - \\nabla_m R_{ik} + \\nabla_i R_{km}) = 0$$\nUsing metric compatibility, $\\nabla_j g^{ik} = 0$, we can move the metric inside the derivatives:\n$$\\nabla_k (g^{ik}R_{mi}) - \\nabla_m (g^{ik}R_{ik}) + \\nabla_i (g^{ik}R_{km}) = 0$$\nLet's analyze each term. Let $R^a{}_{b} = g^{ac}R_{cb}$.\n-   $\\nabla_k (g^{ik}R_{mi}) = \\nabla_k R^k{}_{m}$\n-   $\\nabla_m (g^{ik}R_{ik}) = \\nabla_m R$ (since $g^{ik}R_{ik}$ is the scalar curvature $R$)\n-   $\\nabla_i (g^{ik}R_{km}) = \\nabla_i R^i{}_{m}$\nThe identity becomes:\n$$\\nabla_k R^k{}_{m} - \\nabla_m R + \\nabla_i R^i{}_{m} = 0$$\nRenaming the dummy summation index $k$ to $i$ in the first term, we get:\n$$\\nabla_i R^i{}_{m} - \\nabla_m R + \\nabla_i R^i{}_{m} = 0$$\n$$2\\nabla_i R^i{}_{m} - \\nabla_m R = 0$$\nThis leads to the contracted Bianchi identity:\n$$\\nabla_i R^i{}_{m} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_m R$$\nOr, raising the free index $m$ and renaming indices, $\\nabla_a R^{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R$.\n\nNow we compute the divergence of the Einstein tensor $G^{ab} = R^{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R g^{ab}$:\n$$\\nabla_a G^{ab} = \\nabla_a \\left(R^{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R g^{ab}\\right) = \\nabla_a R^{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_a(R g^{ab})$$\nUsing the product rule and metric compatibility ($\\nabla_a g^{ab} = 0$):\n$$\\nabla_a G^{ab} = \\nabla_a R^{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}g^{ab}\\nabla_a R = \\nabla_a R^{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R$$\nSubstituting the contracted Bianchi identity $\\nabla_a R^{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R$:\n$$\\nabla_a G^{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R = 0$$\nThus, the Einstein tensor is divergence-free, $\\nabla_a G^{ab} = 0$.\n\nNext, we analyze the equation $\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a)$ and its implications for $\\nabla_b R$. From part (a), we have the identity $G^a{}_a = R(1 - \\frac{n}{2})$. Taking the covariant derivative (which is just the gradient for a scalar field):\n$$\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a) = \\nabla_b\\left[R\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{2}\\right)\\right] = \\left(1 - \\frac{n}{2}\\right)\\nabla_b R$$\nThis identity holds for any Riemannian manifold. The divergence-free condition $\\nabla_a G^{ab} = 0$ is a separate consequence of the Bianchi identity. We now analyze the interplay in the specified cases.\n\n**General dimension $n$**:\nThe relation is $\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a) = (1 - \\frac{n}{2})\\nabla_b R$. If $n \\neq 2$, this means that the gradient of the scalar curvature $\\nabla_b R$ is zero if and only if the gradient of the trace of the Einstein tensor $\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a)$ is zero. The divergence-free condition $\\nabla_a G^{ab}=0$ does not, in general, impose any constraint on the trace $G^a{}_a$ or its gradient. Therefore, for a general manifold, $\\nabla_b R$ is not constrained to be zero.\n\n**Special case $n=2$**:\nIn two dimensions, the relation becomes:\n$$\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a) = \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{2}\\right)\\nabla_b R = 0 \\cdot \\nabla_b R = 0$$\nThis is an identity $0=0$, because for $n=2$, the Einstein tensor is identically zero, $G_{ab} \\equiv 0$. This can be shown by noting that in $2$D, $R_{ab} = K g_{ab}$ where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature, and $R=g^{ab}R_{ab}=2K$. Thus, $G_{ab} = R_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R g_{ab} = K g_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}(2K)g_{ab} = 0$. Consequently, its trace $G^a{}_a$ is also zero, and so is its gradient. The relation $\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a)=(1-n/2)\\nabla_b R$ becomes trivial and provides no information whatsoever on $\\nabla_b R$. The scalar curvature $R$ (and Gaussian curvature $K$) can be a non-constant function on a 2D surface.\n\n**Einstein metrics $R_{ab}=\\lambda\\,g_{ab}$**:\nAn Einstein manifold is defined by $R_{ab} = \\lambda g_{ab}$ where $\\lambda$ is a constant.\nThe scalar curvature is $R = g^{ab}R_{ab} = g^{ab}(\\lambda g_{ab}) = \\lambda(g^{ab}g_{ab}) = \\lambda n$. Since both $\\lambda$ and $n$ are constants, $R$ is constant, which implies $\\nabla_b R = 0$.\nThe trace relation $\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a) = (1 - \\frac{n}{2})\\nabla_b R$ becomes $\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a) = 0$, which is consistent since $G^a{}_a = n\\lambda(1-n/2)$ is also a constant.\nThe crucial insight here comes from the contracted Bianchi identity, not the trace relation. If we assume $R_{ab} = \\lambda(x) g_{ab}$ where $\\lambda$ could be a function, the contracted Bianchi identity $\\nabla_a R^{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R$ imposes a strong constraint.\n-   $\\nabla_a R^{ab} = \\nabla_a(\\lambda g^{ab}) = g^{ab}\\nabla_a \\lambda = \\nabla^b \\lambda$.\n-   $\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b (n\\lambda) = \\frac{n}{2}\\nabla^b \\lambda$.\nThe condition becomes $\\nabla^b \\lambda = \\frac{n}{2}\\nabla^b \\lambda$, which simplifies to $(1 - \\frac{n}{2})\\nabla^b \\lambda = 0$.\nIf $n>2$, this forces $\\nabla^b \\lambda = 0$, meaning $\\lambda$ must be constant (this is Schur's Lemma for $n>2$). Thus, for $n>2$, any manifold satisfying $R_{ab} = \\lambda g_{ab}$ is an Einstein manifold with constant $\\lambda$, which in turn forces $\\nabla_b R = 0$. The constancy of $R$ is a consequence of the Bianchi identity.\nIf $n=2$, the equation becomes $0=0$, placing no restriction on $\\lambda(x)$, consistent with our finding for the general $n=2$ case.\n\nIn summary, the divergence-free condition $\\nabla_a G^{ab}=0$ and the constancy of scalar curvature on Einstein manifolds (for $n>2$) are both consequences of the second Bianchi identity. The trace relation from part (a) is an algebraic identity that is consistent with these facts but does not, by itself, generate them.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{R\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{2}\\right)}$$", "id": "2993781"}]}
