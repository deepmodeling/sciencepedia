The derivation shall proceed from the Gauss equation, followed by tensor contractions.\n\nLet $i: S^n(r) \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be the inclusion map, where $S^n(r) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \\|x\\|^2 = r^2\\}$. The metric $g \\equiv g_{\\mathrm{round}}$ on $S^n(r)$ is the metric induced by the standard Euclidean metric $\\bar{g}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $p \\in S^n(r)$ be a point on the sphere.

We choose the outward-pointing unit normal vector field $N$ on $S^n(r)$, given by $N(p) = \\frac{p}{r}$.\n\nThe derivation requires the second fundamental form, which is determined by the shape operator (or Weingarten map) $L$. The shape operator $L_p: T_p S^n(r) \\to T_p S^n(r)$ is defined by the Weingarten equation, which relates the ambient covariant derivative $\\bar{\\nabla}$ (which is the standard directional derivative in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$) to $L$. One common convention for the Weingarten equation is $\\bar{\\nabla}_X N = -L(X)$ for any tangent vector field $X$ on $S^n(r)$. Let us adopt the convention $\\bar{\\nabla}_X N = L(X)$.\nLet $X \\in T_p S^n(r)$. We compute $\\bar{\\nabla}_X N$ at $p$. Let $\\gamma(t)$ be a curve on $S^n(r)$ such that $\\gamma(0) = p$ and $\\gamma'(0) = X$.\n$$\nL(X) = \\bar{\\nabla}_X N |_p = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} N(\\gamma(t)) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\frac{\\gamma(t)}{r} = \\frac{\\gamma'(0)}{r} = \\frac{X}{r}\n$$\nThe vector $X/r$ is in $T_p S^n(r)$, so this is consistent. The shape operator is a tensor field on $S^n(r)$ given by $L = \\frac{1}{r}\\mathrm{Id}$, where $\\mathrm{Id}$ is the identity operator on each tangent space.\n\nThe second fundamental form, $II$, is a symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor field defined by $II(X,Y) = g(L(X), Y)$ for tangent vector fields $X,Y$.\nSubstituting the expression for $L$, we get:\n$$\nII(X,Y) = g\\left(\\frac{1}{r}X, Y\\right) = \\frac{1}{r}g(X,Y)\n$$\n\nThe next step is to use the Gauss equation, which relates the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ of the hypersurface $S^n(r)$ to the Riemann curvature tensor $\\bar{R}$ of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and the second fundamental form $II$. For any tangent vector fields $X, Y, Z, W$ on $S^n(r)$, the Gauss equation is:\n$$\ng(R(X,Y)Z, W) = \\bar{g}(\\bar{R}(X,Y)Z, W) + II(X,W)II(Y,Z) - II(X,Z)II(Y,W)\n$$\nThe ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is flat, which means its Riemann curvature tensor $\\bar{R}$ is identically zero. Thus, the Gauss equation simplifies to the \"Theorema Egregium\":\n$$\ng(R(X,Y)Z, W) = II(X,W)II(Y,Z) - II(X,Z)II(Y,W)\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for the second fundamental form, $II(U,V) = \\frac{1}{r}g(U,V)$:\n$$\ng(R(X,Y)Z, W) = \\left(\\frac{1}{r}g(X,W)\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{r}g(Y,Z)\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{r}g(X,Z)\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{r}g(Y,W)\\right)\n$$\n$$\ng(R(X,Y)Z, W) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[ g(Y,Z)g(X,W) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) \\right]\n$$\nThis equation defines the $(0,4)$ Riemann curvature tensor, $R_{ijkl}$. By the non-degeneracy of the metric $g$, we can determine the $(1,3)$ tensor $R(X,Y)Z$. It is the unique vector satisfying the above relation for all $W$. By inspection, we find:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[ g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y \\right]\n$$\nThis is the expression for the Riemann curvature tensor of a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K = \\frac{1}{r^2}$.\n\nNow, we contract the Riemann tensor to obtain the Ricci tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$. The Ricci tensor is a $(0,2)$-tensor defined as the trace of the map $X \\mapsto R(X,Y)Z$. Let $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be a local orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_p S^n(r)$, so $g(e_i, e_j) = \\delta_{ij}$. The component $\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z)$ is given by the trace:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\mathrm{tr}_{g}(X \\mapsto R(X,Y)Z) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g(R(e_i,Y)Z, e_i)\n$$\nUsing the expression for the Riemann tensor:\n$$\nR(e_i,Y)Z = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[ g(Y,Z)e_i - g(e_i,Z)Y \\right]\n$$\nWe take the inner product with $e_i$:\n$$\ng(R(e_i,Y)Z, e_i) = g\\left(\\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[ g(Y,Z)e_i - g(e_i,Z)Y \\right], e_i\\right)\n$$\nBy linearity of the metric:\n$$\ng(R(e_i,Y)Z, e_i) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[ g(Y,Z)g(e_i,e_i) - g(e_i,Z)g(Y,e_i) \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\{e_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, $g(e_i,e_i) = 1$.\n$$\ng(R(e_i,Y)Z, e_i) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[ g(Y,Z) - g(Z,e_i)g(Y,e_i) \\right]\n$$\nNow, we sum over $i$ from $1$ to $n$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[ g(Y,Z) - g(Z,e_i)g(Y,e_i) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g(Y,Z) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g(Y,e_i)g(Z,e_i) \\right]\n$$\nThe first summation gives $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g(Y,Z) = n \\cdot g(Y,Z)$. The second summation is the definition of the inner product $g(Y,Z)$ in terms of the orthonormal basis (Parseval's identity): $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g(Y,e_i)g(Z,e_i) = g(Y,Z)$.\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for the Ricci tensor:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[ n \\cdot g(Y,Z) - g(Y,Z) \\right] = \\frac{n-1}{r^2} g(Y,Z)\n$$\nSo, the Ricci tensor is $\\mathrm{Ric} = \\frac{n-1}{r^2} g$. This shows that $S^n(r)$ is an Einstein manifold.\n\nFinally, we derive the scalar curvature $S$ by contracting the Ricci tensor. The scalar curvature is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric:\n$$\nS = \\mathrm{tr}_{g}(\\mathrm{Ric})\n$$\nUsing the same orthonormal basis $\\{e_i\\}$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathrm{Ric}(e_i, e_i)\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for the Ricci tensor:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(e_i, e_i) = \\frac{n-1}{r^2} g(e_i, e_i) = \\frac{n-1}{r^2} (1) = \\frac{n-1}{r^2}\n$$\nThe scalar curvature is the sum of these $n$ identical terms:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{n-1}{r^2} = n \\left( \\frac{n-1}{r^2} \\right)\n$$\nThus, the scalar curvature of the $n$-sphere of radius $r$ is:\n$$\nS = \\frac{n(n-1)}{r^2}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n(n-1)}{r^2}}$$", "id": "3002125"}, {"introduction": "Having analyzed a single manifold, we now explore how curvature behaves when we construct new spaces from old ones.

The metric on $M$ is the product metric $G = \\gamma \\oplus \\sigma$. The derivation must proceed from first principles.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Connection and Curvature Structure\n\nLet $(M_1, g_1) = (\\Sigma_g, \\gamma)$ and $(M_2, g_2) = (S^2, \\sigma)$. The product manifold is $M = M_1 \\times M_2$, and its metric is $G = g_1 \\oplus g_2$. The tangent space at any point $p=(p_1, p_2) \\in M$ decomposes as a direct sum $T_p M = T_{p_1}M_1 \\oplus T_{p_2}M_2$. We refer to vectors in $T_{p_1}M_1$ as \"horizontal\" and vectors in $T_{p_2}M_2$ as \"vertical\". The product metric $G$ by definition satisfies $G(X,Y) = 0$ if $X$ is horizontal and $Y$ is vertical. For two horizontal vectors $X, Y$, $G(X,Y) = g_1(X,Y)$, and for two vertical vectors $U, V$, $G(U,V) = g_2(U,V)$. We will work with vector fields on $M$ which are either purely horizontal or purely vertical. For such fields, if $X$ is horizontal and $U$ is vertical, their Lie bracket is zero: $[X, U] = 0$.\n\n**1) Levi-Civita Connection on $(M, G)$**\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ on $(M,G)$ is uniquely defined by two properties: it is torsion-free ($[X,Y] = \\nabla_X Y - \\nabla_Y X$) and compatible with the metric ($\\nabla_Z G(X,Y) = G(\\nabla_Z X, Y) + G(X, \\nabla_Z Y)$). Let $\\nabla^1$ and $\\nabla^2$ be the Levi-Civita connections on $(M_1, g_1)$ and $(M_2, g_2)$ respectively. We determine the components of $\\nabla$.\n\n*   **Horizontal-Horizontal Input:** Let $X, Y$ be horizontal vector fields.\n    Let $Z$ be a vertical vector field. From metric compatibility, we have:\n    $$ \\nabla_Z G(X,Y) = G(\\nabla_Z X, Y) + G(X, \\nabla_Z Y) $$\n    Since $G(X,Y)=g_1(X,Y)$ depends only on the coordinates of $M_1$, its derivative along a vertical field $Z$ is zero, so $\\nabla_Z G(X,Y) = Z(g_1(X,Y)) = 0$. Thus, $G(\\nabla_Z X, Y) + G(X, \\nabla_Z Y) = 0$.\n    From the torsion-free property, $\\nabla_Z X = \\nabla_X Z + [Z,X]$. Since $[X,Z]=0$, we get $\\nabla_Z X = \\nabla_X Z$. Substituting this into the previous equation gives $G(\\nabla_X Z, Y) + G(X, \\nabla_Z Y) = 0$.\n    Now consider the connection applied to a mixed pair. For any horizontal $X$ and vertical $U$:\n    $$ \\nabla_X G(Y, U) = G(\\nabla_X Y, U) + G(Y, \\nabla_X U) $$\n    Since $G(Y,U)=0$, the left side is $X(0)=0$. Thus, $G(\\nabla_X Y, U) = -G(Y, \\nabla_X U)$.\n    Combining these facts, we can show that $\\nabla$ respects the horizontal/vertical splitting. Let $X,Y$ be horizontal and $U$ be vertical. $G(\\nabla_X Y, U) = 0$. This implies $\\nabla_X Y$ is horizontal. Symmetrically, $\\nabla_U V$ is vertical for vertical $U,V$.\n    Thus, for horizontal $X, Y$, $\\nabla_X Y$ can be identified with $\\nabla^1_X Y$.\n    Similarly, for vertical $U, V$, $\\nabla_U V$ can be identified with $\\nabla^2_U V$.\n*   **Mixed Input:** Let $X$ be horizontal and $U$ be vertical.\n    We need to determine $\\nabla_X U$. Let $Y$ be any horizontal vector.\n    $$ G(\\nabla_X U, Y) = -G(U, \\nabla_X Y) $$\n    Since $\\nabla_X Y = \\nabla_X^1 Y$ is horizontal, $G(U, \\nabla_X Y) = 0$. So $\\nabla_X U$ has no horizontal component.\n    Now let $V$ be any vertical vector.\n    Metric compatibility gives $\\nabla_X G(U,V) = G(\\nabla_X U, V) + G(U, \\nabla_X V)$.\n    The term $G(U,V)=g_2(U,V)$ depends only on the $M_2$ coordinates, so its derivative along a horizontal field $X$ is zero. So $G(\\nabla_X U, V) + G(U, \\nabla_X V)=0$.\n    Using torsion-free property, $\\nabla_X V = \\nabla_V X + [X,V]$. With $[X,V]=0$, this becomes $\\nabla_X V = \\nabla_V X$.\n    So $G(\\nabla_X U, V) + G(U, \\nabla_V X)=0$.\n    This must hold for any $X,U,V$. The only way this identity holds is if both terms are individually zero. For example, by the Koszul formula one can show $\\nabla_X U = 0$.\n    By torsion-free property, $\\nabla_U X = \\nabla_X U + [U,X] = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n\nIn summary, the connection $\\nabla$ on the product manifold is given by:\n$$ \\nabla_{X_1+X_2}(Y_1+Y_2) = \\nabla^1_{X_1} Y_1 + \\nabla^2_{X_2} Y_2 $$\nwhere $X_1, Y_1$ are horizontal parts and $X_2, Y_2$ are vertical parts.\n\n**2) Riemann and Ricci Curvature Tensors on $(M, G)$**\nThe Riemann curvature tensor is defined as $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$. We use the connection decomposition derived above. Let $R^M, R^\\gamma, R^\\sigma$ be the curvature tensors of $M, \\Sigma_g, S^2$.\n\n*   **Purely Horizontal Inputs:** Let $X, Y, Z$ be horizontal vector fields.\n    $R^M(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X(\\nabla_Y Z) - \\nabla_Y(\\nabla_X Z) - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$.\n    Since $\\nabla_Y Z = \\nabla^\\gamma_Y Z$, which is a horizontal field, $\\nabla_X(\\nabla_Y Z)$ is also just $\\nabla^\\gamma_X(\\nabla^\\gamma_Y Z)$. The same applies to all other terms.\n    $$ R^M(X,Y)Z = \\nabla^\\gamma_X(\\nabla^\\gamma_Y Z) - \\nabla^\\gamma_Y(\\nabla^\\gamma_X Z) - \\nabla^\\gamma_{[X,Y]}Z = R^\\gamma(X,Y)Z $$\n*   **Purely Vertical Inputs:** Similarly, for vertical $U, V, W$:\n    $$ R^M(U,V)W = R^\\sigma(U,V)W $$\n*   **Mixed Inputs:** Consider $R^M(X,U)Y$ where $X,Y$ are horizontal and $U$ is vertical.\n    $$ R^M(X,U)Y = \\nabla_X(\\nabla_U Y) - \\nabla_U(\\nabla_X Y) - \\nabla_{[X,U]}Y $$\n    Using the connection rules: $\\nabla_U Y=0$, $\\nabla_X Y = \\nabla^\\gamma_X Y$ (horizontal), $[X,U]=0$.\n    $$ R^M(X,U)Y = \\nabla_X(0) - \\nabla_U(\\nabla^\\gamma_X Y) - \\nabla_0 Y = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0 $$\n    The term $\\nabla_U(\\nabla^\\gamma_X Y)$ is zero because $\\nabla^\\gamma_X Y$ is a horizontal field, and the connection acts as zero when the differentiating direction is vertical and the field is horizontal.\nAll other types of mixed inputs for the Riemann tensor similarly yield zero.\nThus, the Riemann tensor of the product manifold decomposes. In an orthonormal basis $\\{e_a\\}$ for the horizontal space and $\\{f_i\\}$ for the vertical space, the only non-zero curvature components $R^M_{ABCD}$ are those of the form $R^M_{abcd} = R^\\gamma_{abcd}$ and $R^M_{ijkl} = R^\\sigma_{ijkl}$.\n\nThe Ricci tensor is the trace of the Riemann tensor: $Ric(X,Y) = \\text{tr}(Z \\mapsto R(Z,X)Y)$. Let $\\{E_A\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $T_pM$, composed of horizontal vectors $\\{e_a\\}$ and vertical vectors $\\{f_i\\}$.\n$$ Ric^M(X,Y) = \\sum_A G(R^M(E_A, X)Y, E_A) $$\n*   **Horizontal Inputs:** Let $X, Y$ be horizontal.\n    $$ Ric^M(X,Y) = \\sum_a G(R^M(e_a, X)Y, e_a) + \\sum_i G(R^M(f_i, X)Y, f_i) $$\n    The second sum is zero because $R^M(f_i,X)Y = 0$. The first sum uses purely horizontal components, so:\n    $$ Ric^M(X,Y) = \\sum_a \\gamma(R^\\gamma(e_a, X)Y, e_a) = Ric^\\gamma(X,Y) $$\n*   **Vertical Inputs:** For vertical $U, V$, a similar calculation gives:\n    $$ Ric^M(U,V) = Ric^\\sigma(U,V) $$\n*   **Mixed Inputs:** For horizontal $X$ and vertical $U$:\n    $$ Ric^M(X,U) = \\sum_a G(R^M(e_a, X)U, e_a) + \\sum_i G(R^M(f_i, X)U, f_i) = 0 $$\n    Both terms are zero due to the vanishing of mixed curvature terms.\nIn summary, the Ricci tensor also decomposes as a direct sum: $Ric^M = Ric^\\gamma \\oplus Ric^\\sigma$.\n\n### Part 2: Scalar Curvature Calculation\n\nThe scalar curvature $S_G$ of $(M,G)$ is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric $G$. Using an orthonormal basis $\\{e_a, f_i\\}$ as before:\n$$ S_G = \\text{tr}_G(Ric^M) = \\sum_A Ric^M(E_A, E_A) = \\sum_a Ric^M(e_a, e_a) + \\sum_i Ric^M(f_i, f_i) $$\nUsing the decomposition of the Ricci tensor:\n$$ S_G = \\sum_a Ric^\\gamma(e_a, e_a) + \\sum_i Ric^\\sigma(f_i, f_i) $$\nThese are the definitions of the scalar curvatures of the factor manifolds, $S_\\gamma$ and $S_\\sigma$.\n$$ S_G = S_\\gamma + S_\\sigma $$\nThis general formula shows that the scalar curvature of a Riemannian product is the sum of the scalar curvatures of its factors.\n\nNow we evaluate this for the given metrics. For a $2$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the scalar curvature $S$ is related to the Gauss curvature $K$ by the formula $S=2K$.\n\n*   For $(\\Sigma_g, \\gamma)$, we have constant Gauss curvature $K_\\Sigma = -1$.\n    The scalar curvature is $S_\\gamma = 2 K_\\Sigma = 2(-1) = -2$.\n*   For $(S^2, \\sigma)$, we have constant Gauss curvature $K_{S^2} = +1$.\n    The scalar curvature is $S_\\sigma = 2 K_{S^2} = 2(+1) = +2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $S_G$:\n$$ S_G = S_\\gamma + S_\\sigma = -2 + 2 = 0 $$\nThe scalar curvature of the product manifold $(M,G)$ is identically zero.\n\n### Part 3: Justification of Non-triviality\n\nThe problem asks why this example is non-trivial, in the sense that the full Riemann curvature tensor $R^M$ of $(M,G)$ is not identically zero, even though its scalar curvature $S_G$ is zero.\n\nThe scalar curvature is the full trace of the Ricci tensor, which is itself a partial trace of the Riemann tensor. Vanishing scalar curvature is a much weaker condition than the vanishing of the Riemann tensor (which signifies a flat manifold).\n\nFrom Part 1, we established that the components of $R^M$ are directly inherited from the components of $R^\\gamma$ and $R^\\sigma$. Let's examine if these factor-manifold curvatures are zero.\nFor a $2$-dimensional manifold, the Riemann tensor is non-zero if and only if the Gauss curvature is non-zero. The components of the Riemann tensor in an orthonormal basis $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ are determined by $R_{1212} = K$.\n\n*   For $(\\Sigma_g, \\gamma)$, $K_\\Sigma = -1 \\neq 0$. Therefore, its Riemann tensor $R^\\gamma$ is not identically zero. For example, in a local orthonormal frame $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ for $\\Sigma_g$, the component $R^\\gamma_{1212} = -1$.\n*   For $(S^2, \\sigma)$, $K_{S^2} = +1 \\neq 0$. Therefore, its Riemann tensor $R^\\sigma$ is not identically zero. In a local orthonormal frame $\\{f_3, f_4\\}$ for $S^2$, $R^\\sigma_{3434} = +1$.\n\nSince the Riemann tensor $R^M$ of the product manifold contains these non-zero blocks, $R^M$ itself is not identically zero. In a local orthonormal frame $\\{e_1, e_2, f_3, f_4\\}$ for $M$, we have specific non-zero components:\n$$ R^M_{1212} = R^\\gamma_{1212} = -1 \\neq 0 $$\n$$ R^M_{3434} = R^\\sigma_{3434} = +1 \\neq 0 $$\nThe existence of any non-zero component means the tensor is not identically zero.\n\nTherefore, the manifold $(M,G)$ is curved ($R^M \\neq 0$). It is not even Ricci-flat, because $Ric^M = Ric^\\gamma \\oplus Ric^\\sigma$, and neither $Ric^\\gamma$ nor $Ric^\\sigma$ are zero (for a 2-manifold, $Ric=Kg$, so $Ric^\\gamma = -\\gamma$ and $Ric^\\sigma = \\sigma$). The scalar curvature $S_G$ vanishes due to a precise cancellation between the positive curvature of the sphere and the negative curvature of the hyperbolic surface.

The dimension of $M$ is $n$.\n\nA standard formula for the scalar curvature of a warped product metric of this form is:\n$$\nS_{g}(t) = \\frac{S_{\\bar{g}}}{f(t)^{2}} - 2(n-1)\\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)} - (n-1)(n-2)\\frac{(f'(t))^{2}}{f(t)^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $S_{\\bar{g}}$ is the scalar curvature of the fiber manifold $(N, \\bar{g})$, and derivatives of $f$ are with respect to $t$.\n\nWe need to compute the terms in this formula for our specific case.\n\n1.  **Scalar Curvature of the Fiber Manifold**:\n    The fiber manifold is the standard unit $(n-1)$-sphere, $(S^{n-1}, g_{S^{n-1}})$. Its scalar curvature $S_{\\bar{g}}$ is a well-known constant:\n    $$\n    S_{\\bar{g}} = S_{S^{n-1}} = (n-1)((n-1)-1) = (n-1)(n-2)\n    $$\n\n2.  **Warping Function and its Derivatives**:\n    The given warping function is $f(t) = (\\delta^2 + t^2)^{1/2}$ with $\\delta > 0$.
