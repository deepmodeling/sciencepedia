Similarly, $g(F,F)=1$. And $g(E,F)=g_{1}(E_{1},F_{1}) + g_{2}(0,0) = 0$. So $\\{E,F\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $\\sigma$.\nNow we compute $R(E,F)F$:\n$$\nR(E,F)F = R((E_{1}, 0), (F_{1}, 0))(F_{1}, 0) = \\left(R_{S^{2}}(E_{1}, F_{1})F_{1}, R_{S^{2}}(0, 0)0\\right)\n$$\nSince the Riemann tensor is multilinear, $R_{S^{2}}(0,0)0$ is the zero vector. So, $R(E,F)F = (R_{S^{2}}(E_{1}, F_{1})F_{1}, 0)$.\nThe sectional curvature is:\n$$\nK(\\sigma) = g(R(E,F)F, E) = g\\left((R_{S^{2}}(E_{1}, F_{1})F_{1}, 0), (E_{1}, 0)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nK(\\sigma) = g_{1}(R_{S^{2}}(E_{1}, F_{1})F_{1}, E_{1}) + g_{2}(0, 0) = g_{1}(R_{S^{2}}(E_{1}, F_{1})F_{1}, E_{1})\n$$\nThis is precisely the sectional curvature $K_{S^{2}}$ of the plane in $S^{2}$ spanned by $E_{1}$ and $F_{1}$. The problem states that $S^{2}$ has constant sectional curvature $+1$. Therefore, for any unmixed plane, the sectional curvature is $1$.\n\nCase 2: Mixed planes.\nA mixed plane $\\sigma$ is spanned by one vector from each factor. Let the spanning vectors be $E$ and $F$, where $E$ is tangent to the first factor and $F$ to the second. We can write them as $E=(E_{1}, 0)$ and $F=(0, F_{2})$. We can choose $E_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ to be unit vectors, so $g_{1}(E_{1},E_{1})=1$ and $g_{2}(F_{2},F_{2})=1$.\nOn $M$, these vectors are orthonormal: $g(E,E) = g_{1}(E_{1},E_{1}) + g_{2}(0,0) = 1$. $g(F,F) = g_{1}(0,0) + g_{2}(F_{2},F_{2}) = 1$. $g(E,F) = g_{1}(E_{1},0) + g_{2}(0,F_{2}) = 0$.\nNow we compute $R(E,F)F$:\n$$\nR(E,F)F = R((E_{1}, 0), (0, F_{2}))(0, F_{2})\n$$\nUsing the curvature formula with $X=(E_{1},0)$, $Y=(0,F_{2})$, and $Z=(0,F_{2})$, we have $X_{1}=E_{1}, X_{2}=0$, $Y_{1}=0, Y_{2}=F_{2}$, and $Z_{1}=0, Z_{2}=F_{2}$.\n$$\nR(E,F)F = \\left(R_{S^{2}}(E_{1}, 0)0, R_{S^{2}}(0, F_{2})F_{2}\\right)\n$$\nAgain, by the multilinearity of the Riemann tensor, both components are the zero vector. $R(E,F)F = (0, 0)$.\nThe sectional curvature is thus:\n$$\nK(\\sigma) = g(R(E,F)F, E) = g((0,0), (E_{1}, 0)) = 0\n$$\nTherefore, for any mixed plane, the sectional curvature is $0$.\n\nThe three requested results are: the expression for the Riemann curvature endomorphism, the sectional curvature of an unmixed plane, and the sectional curvature of a mixed plane.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} (R_{S^{2}}(X_1,Y_1)Z_1, R_{S^{2}}(X_2,Y_2)Z_2) & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3002331"}]}
