We will address the problem by working from first principles as required.\n\nLet $G$ be a Lie group with a left-invariant Riemannian metric $g$. Its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is endowed with an inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ induced by $g$ at the identity. For any $X, Y, Z \\in \\mathfrak{g}$, we identify them with the corresponding left-invariant vector fields on $G$.

A non-abelian nilpotent Lie group with a left-invariant metric can have positive sectional curvature. It is a known result that such groups must also have some negative sectional curvature, but this does not preclude the existence of positive curvatures. We will prove this by providing a constructive example as requested in Part 2. The calculation below shows that for the Heisenberg group, certain planes have strictly positive sectional curvature.\n\nBefore the specific calculation, let us analyze the curvature of a plane containing a central element. Let $Z \\in Z(\\mathfrak{g})$ be a non-zero vector in the center of the Lie algebra, i.e., $[Z,U]=0$ for all $U \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. Let $X \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ be a vector such that $\\{X,Z\\}$ form an orthonormal pair.\nWe compute $K(X,Z) = \\langle R(X,Z)Z, X \\rangle$.\n$R(X,Z)Z = \\nabla_X\\nabla_Z Z - \\nabla_Z\\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Z]}Z$.\nSince $Z$ is central, $[X,Z]=0$, so the third term vanishes.\nLet's compute $\\nabla_Z Z$. For any vector $W \\in \\mathfrak{g}$:\n$2\\langle \\nabla_Z Z, W \\rangle = \\langle [Z,Z], W \\rangle - \\langle [Z,W], Z \\rangle - \\langle [Z,W], Z \\rangle = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0$.\nAs this holds for all $W$, we must have $\\nabla_Z Z = 0$.\nThe curvature tensor expression simplifies to $R(X,Z)Z = -\\nabla_Z(\\nabla_X Z)$.\nThen, $K(X,Z) = \\langle -\\nabla_Z(\\nabla_X Z), X \\rangle$.\nUsing metric compatibility, $\\langle \\nabla_U V, W \\rangle = -\\langle V, \\nabla_U W \\rangle$, we have:\n$K(X,Z) = -(-\\langle \\nabla_X Z, \\nabla_Z X \\rangle) = \\langle \\nabla_X Z, \\nabla_Z X \\rangle$.\nFrom the torsion-free property, $\\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_Z X = [X,Z]$. Since $Z$ is central, $[X,Z]=0$, which implies $\\nabla_X Z = \\nabla_Z X$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for curvature, we get:\n$$K(X,Z) = \\langle \\nabla_X Z, \\nabla_X Z \\rangle = \\|\\nabla_X Z\\|^2$$\nThis remarkable result shows that the sectional curvature of any plane spanned by a central vector $Z$ and another vector $X$ orthogonal to it is non-negative. It will be strictly positive if $\\nabla_X Z$ is non-zero.\n\n**Part 2: Explicit Computation for the Heisenberg Group**\nWe are given the $3$-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ with an orthonormal basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ satisfying the commutation relations $[e_1,e_2]=c\\,e_3$, $[e_1,e_3]=0$, and $[e_2,e_3]=0$, for a constant $c>0$.\nFrom the brackets, it is clear that $e_3$ is a central element, $e_3 \\in Z(\\mathfrak{g})$.\nWe are asked to compute the sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)$ for the $2$-plane $\\sigma=\\mathrm{span}\\{e_1,e_3\\}$.

The formula simplifies to:\n$2\\langle \\nabla_{e_1} e_3, e_i \\rangle = -\\langle [e_1,e_i], e_3 \\rangle$.\n\nLet's evaluate this for $i=1, 2, 3$:\n- For $i=1$: $2\\langle \\nabla_{e_1} e_3, e_1 \\rangle = -\\langle [e_1,e_1], e_3 \\rangle = -\\langle 0, e_3 \\rangle = 0$.\n- For $i=2$: $2\\langle \\nabla_{e_1} e_3, e_2 \\rangle = -\\langle [e_1,e_2], e_3 \\rangle = -\\langle c\\,e_3, e_3 \\rangle = -c\\langle e_3, e_3 \\rangle = -c\\|e_3\\|^2 = -c$, since $\\{e_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis.\n- For $i=3$: $2\\langle \\nabla_{e_1} e_3, e_3 \\rangle = -\\langle [e_1,e_3], e_3 \\rangle = -\\langle 0, e_3 \\rangle = 0$.\n\nThese components determine the vector $\\nabla_{e_1} e_3$ in the basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$.\n$\\nabla_{e_1} e_3 = \\langle \\nabla_{e_1} e_3, e_1 \\rangle e_1 + \\langle \\nabla_{e_1} e_3, e_2 \\rangle e_2 + \\langle \\nabla_{e_1} e_3, e_3 \\rangle e_3 = 0 \\cdot e_1 + (-\\frac{c}{2}) e_2 + 0 \\cdot e_3 = -\\frac{c}{2}e_2$.\n\nNow we can compute the sectional curvature:\n$K(e_1, e_3) = \\|\\nabla_{e_1} e_3\\|^2 = \\left\\|-\\frac{c}{2}e_2\\right\\|^2 = \\left(-\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2 \\|e_2\\|^2 = \\frac{c^2}{4}(1) = \\frac{c^2}{4}$.\n\nSince $c>0$, the sectional curvature $K(\\mathrm{span}\\{e_1,e_3\\}) = \\frac{c^2}{4}$ is strictly positive.

In components, this is $\\Gamma_{ij}^k - \\Gamma_{ji}^k = c_{ij}^k$. This allows us to find the remaining coefficients, e.g., $\\Gamma_{21}^3 = \\Gamma_{12}^3 - c_{12}^3 = (2t - \\frac{1}{t}) - 2t = -\\frac{1}{t}$.\nThis leads to the following expressions for the connection:\n$\\nabla_{e_1} e_1 = 0, \\quad \\nabla_{e_2} e_2 = 0, \\quad \\nabla_{e_3} e_3 = 0.$\n$\\nabla_{e_1} e_2 = \\Gamma_{12}^3 e_3 = (2t - \\frac{1}{t}) e_3, \\quad \\nabla_{e_2} e_1 = (\\Gamma_{12}^3 - c_{12}^3)e_3 = -\\frac{1}{t} e_3.$\n$\\nabla_{e_2} e_3 = \\Gamma_{23}^1 e_1 = \\frac{1}{t} e_1, \\quad \\nabla_{e_3} e_2 = (\\Gamma_{23}^1 - c_{23}^1)e_1 = (\\frac{1}{t} - \\frac{2}{t})e_1 = -\\frac{1}{t} e_1.$\n$\\nabla_{e_3} e_1 = \\Gamma_{31}^2 e_2 = \\frac{1}{t}e_2, \\quad \\nabla_{e_1} e_3 = (\\Gamma_{31}^2 - c_{31}^2)e_2 = (\\frac{1}{t}-2t)e_2.$\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor is given by $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]} Z$. The sectional curvature of the plane spanned by orthonormal vectors $X, Y$ is $K(X \\wedge Y) = \\langle R(X,Y)Y, X \\rangle$.\nWe compute the sectional curvatures for the planes spanned by the basis vectors:\n$K(e_1 \\wedge e_2) = \\langle R(e_1, e_2)e_2, e_1 \\rangle$.\n$R(e_1, e_2)e_2 = \\nabla_{e_1}(\\nabla_{e_2}e_2) - \\nabla_{e_2}(\\nabla_{e_1}e_2) - \\nabla_{[e_1,e_2]}e_2 = 0 - \\nabla_{e_2}((2t-\\frac{1}{t})e_3) - \\nabla_{2t e_3}e_2$\n$= -(2t-\\frac{1}{t})\\nabla_{e_2}e_3 - 2t\\nabla_{e_3}e_2 = -(2t-\\frac{1}{t})(\\frac{1}{t}e_1) - 2t(-\\frac{1}{t}e_1) = (-2+\\frac{1}{t^2})e_1 + 2e_1 = \\frac{1}{t^2}e_1.$\nSo, $K(e_1 \\wedge e_2) = \\langle \\frac{1}{t^2}e_1, e_1 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{t^2}.$\n\n$K(e_1 \\wedge e_3) = \\langle R(e_1, e_3)e_3, e_1 \\rangle$.\n$R(e_1, e_3)e_3 = \\nabla_{e_1}(\\nabla_{e_3}e_3) - \\nabla_{e_3}(\\nabla_{e_1}e_3) - \\nabla_{[e_1,e_3]}e_3 = 0 - \\nabla_{e_3}((\\frac{1}{t}-2t)e_2) - \\nabla_{-2t e_2}e_3$\n$= -(\\frac{1}{t}-2t)\\nabla_{e_3}e_2 + 2t\\nabla_{e_2}e_3 = -(\\frac{1}{t}-2t)(-\\frac{1}{t}e_1) + 2t(\\frac{1}{t}e_1) = (\\frac{1}{t^2}-2)e_1 + 2e_1 = \\frac{1}{t^2}e_1.$\nSo, $K(e_1 \\wedge e_3) = \\langle \\frac{1}{t^2}e_1, e_1 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{t^2}.$\n\n$K(e_2 \\wedge e_3) = \\langle R(e_2, e_3)e_3, e_2 \\rangle$.\n$R(e_2, e_3)e_3 = \\nabla_{e_2}(\\nabla_{e_3}e_3) - \\nabla_{e_3}(\\nabla_{e_2}e_3) - \\nabla_{[e_2,e_3]}e_3 = 0 - \\nabla_{e_3}(\\frac{1}{t}e_1) - \\nabla_{\\frac{2}{t}e_1}e_3$\n$= -\\frac{1}{t}\\nabla_{e_3}e_1 - \\frac{2}{t}\\nabla_{e_1}e_3 = -\\frac{1}{t}(\\frac{1}{t}e_2) - \\frac{2}{t}(\\frac{1}{t}-2t)e_2 = -\\frac{1}{t^2}e_2 - (\\frac{2}{t^2}-4)e_2 = (4-\\frac{3}{t^2})e_2.$\nSo, $K(e_2 \\wedge e_3) = \\langle (4-\\frac{3}{t^2})e_2, e_2 \\rangle = 4-\\frac{3}{t^2}.$\n\nThe Ricci tensor is computed using the formula $\\operatorname{Ric}(v,v) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\langle R(e_i,v)v, e_i \\rangle$ for $v$ in the orthonormal basis. This is equivalent to summing the sectional curvatures: $\\operatorname{Ric}(e_j, e_j) = \\sum_{i \\neq j} K(e_i \\wedge e_j)$.\n$\\operatorname{Ric}(e_1, e_1) = K(e_2 \\wedge e_1) + K(e_3 \\wedge e_1) = K(e_1 \\wedge e_2) + K(e_1 \\wedge e_3) = \\frac{1}{t^2} + \\frac{1}{t^2} = \\frac{2}{t^2}.$\n$\\operatorname{Ric}(e_2, e_2) = K(e_1 \\wedge e_2) + K(e_3 \\wedge e_2) = K(e_1 \\wedge e_2) + K(e_2 \\wedge e_3) = \\frac{1}{t^2} + (4-\\frac{3}{t^2}) = 4-\\frac{2}{t^2}.$\n$\\operatorname{Ric}(e_3, e_3) = K(e_1 \\wedge e_3) + K(e_2 \\wedge e_3) = \\frac{1}{t^2} + (4-\\frac{3}{t^2}) = 4-\\frac{2}{t^2}.$\n\nNow, we substitute the specified value $t^2 = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nThe plane is $\\sigma = \\operatorname{span}\\{e_2, e_3\\}$. The sectional curvature is $K(\\sigma) = K(e_2 \\wedge e_3)$.\n$K(\\sigma) = 4 - \\frac{3}{t^2} = 4 - \\frac{3}{2/3} = 4 - \\frac{9}{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}.$\nThe diagonal components of the Ricci tensor are:\n$\\operatorname{Ric}(e_1, e_1) = \\frac{2}{t^2} = \\frac{2}{2/3} = 3.$\n$\\operatorname{Ric}(e_2, e_2) = 4 - \\frac{2}{t^2} = 4 - \\frac{2}{2/3} = 4 - 3 = 1.$\n$\\operatorname{Ric}(e_3, e_3) = 4 - \\frac{2}{t^2} = 4 - 3 = 1.$\n\nThe requested values are $[K(\\sigma), \\operatorname{Ric}(e_1,e_1), \\operatorname{Ric}(e_2,e_2), \\operatorname{Ric}(e_3,e_3)]$.\nThis gives the vector $[-\\frac{1}{2}, 3, 1, 1]$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2}  3  1  1 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2989801"}]}
