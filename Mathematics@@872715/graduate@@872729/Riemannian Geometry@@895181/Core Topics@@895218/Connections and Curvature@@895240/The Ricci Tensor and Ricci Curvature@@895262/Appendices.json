Let $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_pM$, so that $g_p(e_i, e_j) = \\delta_{ij}$ for $i,j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\nThe Ricci tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$, is defined at $p$ by its action on a pair of tangent vectors $X, Y \\in T_pM$. In an orthonormal basis, its components $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = \\mathrm{Ric}(e_i, e_j)$ are given by the trace of the curvature operator $Z \\mapsto R(Z, e_j)e_i$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^2 g_p(R(e_k, e_j)e_i, e_k) $$\nWe compute the components of the Ricci tensor at $p$:\n\n1.

Thus,\n    $$ \\mathrm{Ric}_{11} = g_p(R(e_2, e_1)e_1, e_2) $$\n    By definition, the Gaussian curvature $K(p)$ is the sectional curvature of the tangent plane $T_pM$. For an orthonormal basis $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$, this is given by:\n    $$ K(p) = g_p(R(e_1, e_2)e_2, e_1) $$\n    Using the symmetries of the Riemann tensor, $g(R(X,Y)Z,W) = g(R(Z,W)X,Y)$, we have:\n    $$ g_p(R(e_2, e_1)e_1, e_2) = g_p(R(e_1, e_2)e_2, e_1) = K(p) $$\n    Therefore, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{11} = K(p)$.\n\n2.  For $\\mathrm{Ric}_{22}$:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Ric}_{22} = g_p(R(e_1, e_2)e_2, e_1) + g_p(R(e_2, e_2)e_2, e_2) $$\n    The second term is zero, so:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Ric}_{22} = g_p(R(e_1, e_2)e_2, e_1) = K(p) $$\n\n3.

For the first term, we use another symmetry of the Riemann tensor: $g(R(X,Y)Z,W) = -g(R(X,Y)W,Z)$. Setting $Z=W=e_1$, we find:\n    $$ g_p(R(e_1, e_2)e_1, e_1) = -g_p(R(e_1, e_2)e_1, e_1) \\implies g_p(R(e_1, e_2)e_1, e_1) = 0 $$\n    Thus, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{12} = 0$.

Let $\\gamma(r)$ be a unit-speed radial geodesic starting at $p$, i.e., $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(0)\\|_{g_p}=1$. The velocity vector field along the geodesic is $T(r) = \\dot{\\gamma}(r) = \\partial_r$.\n\nA geodesic circle of radius $r$ is formed by the endpoints of geodesics of length $r$ emanating from $p$. The velocity vector of this circle is tangent to the circle and its length gives the rate of change of arc length of the circle with respect to the angle $\\theta$. This velocity vector is a Jacobi field.\n\nConsider a variation of geodesics $\\alpha(s,r) = \\exp_p(r V(s))$, where $V(s)$ is a smooth curve of unit vectors in $T_pM$ with $V(0) = \\dot{\\gamma}(0)$. The variation field along $\\gamma(r)=\\alpha(0,r)$ is $J(r) = \\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial s}|_{s=0}$. $J(r)$ satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$ \\nabla_T \\nabla_T J + R(T, J)T = 0 $$\nThe field $J(r)$ describes the infinitesimal separation of geodesics. The tangent vector to the geodesic circle at a point $\\gamma(r)$ has length $\\|J(r)\\|$. Due to the rotational symmetry in the construction, $\\|J(r)\\|$ is independent of the initial direction $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$. The circumference $C(r)$ is then given by integrating this length over all angles from $0$ to $2\\pi$:\n$$ C(r) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\|J_\\theta(r)\\| d\\theta = 2\\pi \\|J(r)\\| $$\nwhere $J(r)$ is a Jacobi field resulting from a unit-speed rotation of the initial geodesic velocity.\n\nThe initial conditions for this Jacobi field $J(r)$ are derived from its definition. At $r=0$, $J(0) = \\frac{\\partial\\alpha}{\\partial s}|_{(0,0)} = 0$. The covariant derivative at $r=0$ is $\\nabla_T J(0) = \\frac{DV(s)}{ds}|_{s=0}$, which is the initial velocity of the variation, a unit vector orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$. Let's call it $E_2(0)$.\n\nLet $\\{E_1(r), E_2(r)\\}$ be an orthonormal frame parallel-transported along $\\gamma(r)$, with $E_1(r) = T(r)$ and $E_1(0)=\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$, $E_2(0)$ orthogonal to $E_1(0)$. The Jacobi field $J(r)$ is orthogonal to $T(r)$ for all $r$, so we can write $J(r) = f(r) E_2(r)$ for some scalar function $f(r)$.\n\nSubstituting $J(r) = f(r) E_2(r)$ into the Jacobi equation:\n$\\nabla_T (\\nabla_T (f(r) E_2(r))) + R(T, f(r) E_2(r))T = 0$\n$\\nabla_T (f'(r) E_2(r)) + f(r) R(E_1(r), E_2(r))E_1(r) = 0$ (since $E_2$ is parallel)\n$f''(r) E_2(r) + f(r) R(E_1(r), E_2(r))E_1(r) = 0$\n\nTaking the inner product with $E_2(r)$:\n$f''(r) + f(r) g(R(E_1(r), E_2(r))E_1(r), E_2(r)) = 0$\nThe term $g(R(E_1, E_2)E_1, E_2)$ is the sectional curvature of the plane spanned by $E_1(r)$ and $E_2(r)$, which is the Gaussian curvature $K(\\gamma(r))$ at the point $\\gamma(r)$. This yields the ODE:\n$$ f''(r) + K(\\gamma(r)) f(r) = 0 $$\nThe initial conditions for $J(r)$ translate to conditions for $f(r)$:\n$J(0) = f(0)E_2(0) = 0 \\implies f(0) = 0$.\n$\\nabla_T J(0) = f'(0)E_2(0)$. Since $\\nabla_T J(0)$ is a unit vector, we have $|f'(0)|=1$. We choose $f'(0)=1$.\n\nWe seek a series expansion for $f(r)$ up to the $r^3$ term. We use Taylor's theorem:\n$$ f(r) = f(0) + f'(0)r + \\frac{f''(0)}{2!}r^2 + \\frac{f'''(0)}{3!}r^3 + O(r^4) $$\nThe coefficients are found by differentiating the ODE:\n1.  $f(0) = 0$\n2.  $f'(0) = 1$\n3.  $f''(r) = -K(\\gamma(r))f(r)$. At $r=0$: $f''(0) = -K(\\gamma(0))f(0) = -K(p) \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n4.  $f'''(r) = -K'(\\gamma(r))f(r) - K(\\gamma(r))f'(r)$, where $K' = \\frac{dK}{dr}$. At $r=0$:\n    $f'''(0) = -K'(p)f(0) - K(p)f'(0) = -K'(p) \\cdot 0 - K(p) \\cdot 1 = -K(p)$.\n\nThe coefficient of $r^3$, $f'''(0)/3!$, depends only on $K(p)$. To explain why derivatives of curvature do not affect this term, we can examine the next derivative:\n$f^{(4)}(r) = -K''(r)f(r) - 2K'(r)f'(r) - K(r)f''(r)$.\nAt $r=0$:\n$f^{(4)}(0) = -K''(p)f(0) - 2K'(p)f'(0) - K(p)f''(0) = - K''(p) \\cdot 0 - 2K'(p) \\cdot 1 - K(p) \\cdot 0 = -2K'(p)$.\nThe coefficient of $r^4$, which is $f^{(4)}(0)/4! = -K'(p)/12$, depends on the first derivative of the curvature, $K'(p) = (\\nabla_{\\partial_r} K)(p)$. Thus, derivatives of curvature contribute starting from the $r^4$ term, and do not affect the $r^3$ coefficient.\n\nSubstituting the calculated derivatives into the Taylor series for $f(r)$:\n$$ f(r) = 0 + (1)r + \\frac{0}{2}r^2 + \\frac{-K(p)}{6}r^3 + O(r^4) = r - \\frac{K(p)}{6}r^3 + O(r^4) $$\nThe circumference is $C(r) = 2\\pi f(r)$. Truncating to the $r^3$ term as requested:\n$$ C(r) = 2\\pi \\left( r - \\frac{K(p)}{6}r^3 \\right) = 2\\pi r - \\frac{\\pi K(p)}{3}r^3 $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2\\pi r - \\frac{\\pi K(p)}{3}r^3} $$", "id": "3002151"}, {"introduction": "Warped products are a fundamental construction for building new Riemannian manifolds, appearing frequently in both pure geometry and models of spacetime in physics.

An orthonormal basis for the orthogonal complement of $E_k$ is $\\{E_1, \\dots, E_{k-1}, E_{k+1}, \\dots, E_{n-1}, E_n\\}$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}_g(E_k, E_k) = \\sum_{j=1, j\\neq k}^{n-1} K_g(E_k, E_j) + K_g(E_k, E_n)\n$$\nThere are $(n-2)$ terms in the sum. Using the curvature formulas:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}_g(E_k, E_k) = (n-2) \\frac{\\kappa_{\\Sigma} - (f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} - \\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}\n$$\nThe condition $\\operatorname{Ric}_g \\geq c\\,g$ for some constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ means that $\\operatorname{Ric}_g(X, X) \\geq c\\,g(X, X)$ for any tangent vector $X$. This is equivalent to requiring the eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor (viewed as an endomorphism $g^{-1}\\operatorname{Ric}_g$) to be at least $c$. In our chosen orthonormal basis, the matrix of the Ricci tensor is diagonal, and its diagonal entries are the eigenvalues. These are the values $\\operatorname{Ric}_g(E_i, E_i)$ we just computed.\n\nTherefore, the condition $\\operatorname{Ric}_g \\geq c\\,g$ is equivalent to the following two inequalities holding for all $r \\in I$:\n1.  $\\operatorname{Ric}_g(E_n, E_n) \\geq c \\implies -(n-1)\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} \\geq c$\n2.  $\\operatorname{Ric}_g(E_k, E_k) \\geq c \\implies -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} + (n-2) \\frac{\\kappa_{\\Sigma} - (f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} \\geq c$\n\nThese are the necessary and sufficient pointwise conditions on the function $f(r)$.\n\n**Part 2: Specialization to $f(r) = \\sin r$ on $(0,\\pi) \\times S^{n-1}$**\n\nWe are given the specific case where $\\Sigma = S^{n-1}$ with its standard round metric, which has constant sectional curvature $\\kappa_{\\Sigma}=1$. The warping function is $f(r) = \\sin r$ on the interval $I=(0,\\pi)$. On this interval, $f(r)  0$. The metric is $g = dr^2 + (\\sin r)^2 g_{S^{n-1}}$, which is the standard metric on the $n$-sphere $S^n$ of radius $1$.\n\nWe calculate the derivatives of $f(r)$:\n$$\nf(r) = \\sin r \\quad \\implies \\quad f'(r) = \\cos r \\quad \\implies \\quad f''(r) = -\\sin r\n$$\nNow we substitute these into the two inequalities derived in Part 1.\n\nFor the first condition (radial direction):\n$$\n-(n-1)\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} = -(n-1)\\frac{-\\sin r}{\\sin r} = -(n-1)(-1) = n-1\n$$\nThe inequality becomes $n-1 \\geq c$. This is independent of $r$.\n\nFor the second condition (tangential directions):\n$$\n-\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} + (n-2) \\frac{\\kappa_{\\Sigma} - (f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} = -\\frac{-\\sin r}{\\sin r} + (n-2) \\frac{1 - (\\cos r)^2}{(\\sin r)^2}\n$$\n$$\n= 1 + (n-2) \\frac{\\sin^2 r}{\\sin^2 r} = 1 + (n-2)(1) = n-1\n$$\nThis inequality also becomes $n-1 \\geq c$, and it is also independent of $r$.\n\nBoth conditions require that $c \\leq n-1$. For the inequality $\\operatorname{Ric}_g \\geq c\\,g$ to hold everywhere on $M$, $c$ must satisfy this relation. We are looking for the maximal such constant $c$. Since both Ricci eigenvalues are identically equal to $n-1$ on the entire manifold, the minimum value they attain is $n-1$. Therefore, the maximal possible value for the constant $c$ is $n-1$.\nThis result is consistent with the known fact that the standard $n$-sphere $S^n$ is an Einstein manifold with $\\operatorname{Ric}_g = (n-1)g$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{n-1}$$", "id": "3002144"}]}
