Second, we explain why these results are not valid at the apex ($\\rho=0$).

The principal direction for $\\kappa_2$ is along $X_{\\theta}$, tangent to the circular cross-sections.\n\nFrom the principal curvatures, we compute the Gaussian curvature $K$ and mean curvature $H$:\nThe Gaussian curvature is the product of the principal curvatures:\n$$\nK = \\kappa_1 \\kappa_2 = 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\cot\\alpha}{\\rho} = 0\n$$\nThe mean curvature is the average of the principal curvatures:\n$$\nH = \\frac{1}{2}(\\kappa_1 + \\kappa_2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(0 + \\frac{\\cot\\alpha}{\\rho}\\right) = \\frac{\\cot\\alpha}{2\\rho}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Failure of Formulas at the Apex**\n\nThe formulas for $H$ and $K$ are derived under the assumption that the surface is smooth (a regular surface). The apex of the cone, corresponding to $\\rho=0$, is a singular point of the parametrization and the surface itself.\n1.  **Parametrization Singularity**: At $\\rho=0$, $X(0, \\theta) = (0,0,0)$ for all $\\theta \\in (0, 2\\pi)$. The map is not a homeomorphism from the parameter space to the surface.\n2.  **Degenerate Tangent Space**: The tangent vector $X_{\\theta}$ becomes the zero vector at $\\rho=0$. A basis for the tangent space cannot be formed, so a tangent plane is not defined in the standard way.\n3.  **Degenerate Metric**: The determinant of the first fundamental form is $\\det(g_{ij}) = EG - F^2 = \\rho^2 \\sin^2\\alpha$, which is $0$ at $\\rho=0$. This indicates a breakdown of the local diffeomorphism property.\n4.  **Divergence of Curvature**: The formula for mean curvature, $H = \\frac{\\cot\\alpha}{2\\rho}$, shows that $H \\to \\infty$ as $\\rho \\to 0$. Classical curvature is undefined at this point. In essence, the cone is not a smooth manifold at its apex.\n\n**Part 3: Curvature at the Apex**\n\nAlthough the differential-geometric definitions of curvature fail at the apex, its curvature is manifested in a global sense. This is rigorously described by considering the cone as a metric space and applying the concept of angle deficit.\n\nIf we cut the cone along a generator line and unroll it onto a plane, it forms a circular sector. The radius of this sector is the slant height $\\rho$ of the cone. The circumference of a circular cross-section on the cone at a given $\\rho$ is $C = 2\\pi r$, where the radius of the circle is $r = \\rho\\sin\\alpha$. Thus, $C = 2\\pi\\rho\\sin\\alpha$. This circumference becomes the arc length of the planar sector.\nThe arc length $L_{arc}$ of a sector with radius $R_{sector}$ and angle $\\Theta$ is $L_{arc} = R_{sector} \\cdot \\Theta$. Here, $R_{sector}=\\rho$ and $L_{arc} = 2\\pi\\rho\\sin\\alpha$. So,\n$$\n2\\pi\\rho\\sin\\alpha = \\rho \\cdot \\Theta \\implies \\Theta = 2\\pi\\sin\\alpha\n$$\nFor a flat plane, the angle around a point is $2\\pi$. For the unrolled cone, the angle is $\\Theta = 2\\pi\\sin\\alpha$. Since $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, we have $0  \\sin\\alpha  1$, so $\\Theta  2\\pi$.\nThe *angle deficit* at the apex is the difference between the angle of a flat plane and the angle of the sector:\n$$\n\\delta = 2\\pi - \\Theta = 2\\pi - 2\\pi\\sin\\alpha = 2\\pi(1 - \\sin\\alpha)\n$$\nThis positive angle deficit is the manifestation of positive curvature concentrated at the apex. The generalized Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature over a region, plus the sum of angle deficits at any conical singularities, is equal to $2\\pi$ times the Euler characteristic of the region. For the cone, the Gaussian curvature is $K=0$ everywhere except the apex. The total curvature is concentrated at this one point and is equal to the angle deficit $2\\pi(1-\\sin\\alpha)$. This is a form of distributional curvature, sometimes written using a Dirac delta function.\n\nIn summary, while the smooth curvature $K$ vanishes away from the apex, the apex itself holds the entirety of the cone's Gaussian curvature, quantified by the angle deficit.\nThe final answer requires only the expressions for $H(\\rho)$ and $K(\\rho)$ for $\\rho0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\cot\\alpha}{2\\rho}  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2986720"}]}
