For such a field, the term $\\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma}$ vanishes. The Jacobi equation for a normal Jacobi field therefore reduces to the simpler second-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\nJ'' + k J = 0.\n$$\nTo solve this equation, we consider a basis for the normal bundle of $\\gamma$. Let $\\{E_1(0), \\dots, E_{n-1}(0)\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for the orthogonal complement of $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$ in the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(0)}M$.

A tangential Jacobi field has the form $(at+b)\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. The condition $J(0)=0$ implies $b=0$, and $J(t_0)=0$ for $t_00$ implies $a=0$. Thus, the only tangential Jacobi field vanishing at two distinct points is the trivial one. Consequently, any nontrivial Jacobi field witnessing a conjugate point must be a normal Jacobi field.\n\nWe apply the boundary conditions to our solutions $j_i(t)$:\n$1$. $J(0) = 0 \\implies j_i(0)=0$ for all $i$.\n$j_i(0) = A_i \\cos(0) + B_i \\sin(0) = A_i$.

The multiplicity is the dimension of the vector space of Jacobi fields $J$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_1)=0$. As we have shown, any such Jacobi field must be normal and of the form\n$$\nJ(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{k}t) E_i(t).\n$$\nFor $t=t_1 = \\pi/\\sqrt{k}$, we have $\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t_1)=\\sin(\\pi)=0$, so the condition $J(t_1)=0$ is satisfied for any choice of coefficients $B_i$.\nThe space of such Jacobi fields is spanned by the set of fields $\\{ \\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)E_1(t), \\dots, \\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)E_{n-1}(t) \\}$.

The dimension of this space is the number of independent choices for the coefficients $B_i$, which is $n-1$.\n\nTherefore, the multiplicity of the first conjugate point (and all subsequent conjugate points) is $n-1$.\n\nThe final answer is a row vector containing the first positive conjugate time $t_1$ and its multiplicity.\nFirst entry: $t_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$.\nSecond entry: multiplicity $= n-1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}  n-1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2972036"}, {"introduction": "In stark contrast to positively curved spaces, manifolds with negative curvature, like hyperbolic space, exhibit geodesic spreading.

We denote the coordinates as $(x^1, x^2) = (t, \\theta)$.\n\n#### Gaussian Curvature $K(t)$\n\nThe Gaussian curvature $K$ for a 2D manifold with an orthogonal metric $ds^2 = E(x^1, x^2)(dx^1)^2 + G(x^1, x^2)(dx^2)^2$ is given by the formula:\n$$\nK = -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{EG}} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^1}\\left(\\frac{G_{x^1}}{\\sqrt{EG}}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^2}\\left(\\frac{E_{x^2}}{\\sqrt{EG}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nIn our case, $E = g_{11} = 1$ and $G = g_{22} = f(t)^2$. These components depend only on $t=x^1$. Therefore, any partial derivative with respect to $\\theta=x^2$ is zero, simplifying the formula. We have $\\sqrt{EG} = \\sqrt{1 \\cdot f(t)^2} = f(t)$ (since $f(t)0$). The partial derivative $G_{x^1}$ is $G_t = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(f(t)^2) = 2f(t)f'(t)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the curvature formula:\n$$\nK(t) = -\\frac{1}{2f(t)} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\frac{2f(t)f'(t)}{f(t)}\\right) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{2f(t)} \\left[ \\frac{d}{dt}(2f'(t)) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nK(t) = -\\frac{1}{2f(t)} [2f''(t)] = -\\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the Gaussian curvature of the surface of revolution along the meridian.\n\n#### The Scalar Jacobi Equation\n\nA Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is an infinitesimal variation of geodesics and satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. Let's denote the covariant derivative operator as $D_t = \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$.\n\nThe problem considers a unit-speed meridian geodesic $\\gamma(t)$. In the given coordinates, this is $\\gamma(t) = (t, \\theta_0)$ for some constant $\\theta_0$. The tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\partial_t$. Since $g(\\partial_t, \\partial_t) = g_{11}=1$, this is indeed a unit-speed curve (and it can be verified to be a geodesic).\n\nFor a two-dimensional manifold, the Riemann curvature term simplifies considerably:\n$$\nR(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = K \\left( g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})J - g(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} \\right)\n$$\nGiven that $\\gamma$ is unit-speed, $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) = 1$. The problem specifies that $J(t)$ arises from an orthogonal variation, which means $J(t)$ is everywhere orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, i.e., $g(J, \\dot{\\gamma}) = 0$.\nThe curvature term thus reduces to $R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = K \\cdot J$.\nThe Jacobi equation simplifies to:\n$$\nD_t D_t J + K(t) J = 0\n$$\nThe Jacobi field $J$ is normal to $\\dot{\\gamma}=\\partial_t$, so it must be proportional to $\\partial_\\theta$. We define the unit normal vector field $N(t)$ along $\\gamma(t)$ as:\n$$\nN(t) = \\frac{1}{\\|\\partial_\\theta\\|} \\partial_\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{g(\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_\\theta)}} \\partial_\\theta = \\frac{1}{f(t)} \\partial_\\theta\n$$\nThe Jacobi field $J(t)$ can be expressed as $J(t) = j(t)N(t)$, where $j(t)$ is the scalar normal component we need to find the equation for.\n\nTo proceed, we compute the covariant derivatives of $J(t)$. First, we show that the unit normal field $N(t)$ is parallel-transported along the meridian $\\gamma(t)$, i.e., $D_t N = \\nabla_{\\partial_t} N = 0$.\n$$\nD_t N = \\nabla_{\\partial_t} \\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)}\\partial_\\theta\\right) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)}\\right)\\partial_\\theta + \\frac{1}{f(t)} \\nabla_{\\partial_t} \\partial_\\theta\n$$\nThe Christoffel symbol needed is $\\Gamma^k_{12}$, for $\\nabla_{\\partial_t} \\partial_\\theta = \\Gamma^k_{12}\\partial_k$. We find $\\Gamma^1_{12}=0$ and $\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)}$.\nThus, $\\nabla_{\\partial_t} \\partial_\\theta = \\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)}\\partial_\\theta$.\nSubstituting this back, along with $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\frac{1}{f}) = -\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)^2}$:\n$$\nD_t N = -\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)^2} \\partial_\\theta + \\frac{1}{f(t)} \\left(\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} \\partial_\\theta\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)^2} + \\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)^2}\\right) \\partial_\\theta = 0\n$$\nSince $N(t)$ is parallel-transported, the covariant derivatives of $J(t)=j(t)N(t)$ simplify greatly:\n$$\nD_t J = D_t(jN) = \\frac{dj}{dt}N + j(D_t N) = j'(t)N(t)\n$$\n$$\nD_t D_t J = D_t(j'N) = \\frac{dj'}{dt}N + j'(D_t N) = j''(t)N(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the simplified Jacobi equation $D_t D_t J + K J = 0$:\n$$\nj''(t)N(t) + K(t)j(t)N(t) = 0 \\implies \\left(j''(t) + K(t)j(t)\\right)N(t) = 0\n$$\nAs $N(t)$ is a non-zero vector field, the scalar part must be zero. This yields the final scalar ordinary differential equation for $j(t)$:\n$$\nj''(t) + K(t)j(t) = 0\n$$\n\n### Solution of Test Cases\nThe problem is now reduced to solving the initial value problem $j''(t) + K(t)j(t) = 0$ with $j(0)=0$ and $j'(0)=1$.\n\n#### Case A (Constant Positive Curvature)\n- $f(t)=\\sin t$.\n- $f'(t)=\\cos t$, $f''(t)=-\\sin t$.\n- $K(t) = -f''(t)/f(t) = -(-\\sin t)/\\sin t = 1$.\n- The ODE is $j''(t) + j(t) = 0$.\n- The general solution is $j(t) = C_1 \\cos t + C_2 \\sin t$.\n- Applying initial conditions:\n  - $j(0)=0 \\implies C_1 \\cos 0 + C_2 \\sin 0 = C_1 = 0$.\n  - $j'(t) = C_2 \\cos t$. So $j'(0)=1 \\implies C_2 \\cos 0 = C_2 = 1$.\n- The solution is $j(t) = \\sin t$.\n- At $L=\\pi/3$, $j(\\pi/3) = \\sin(\\pi/3) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n#### Case B (Constant Negative Curvature)\n- $f(t)=\\sinh t$.\n- $f'(t)=\\cosh t$, $f''(t)=\\sinh t$.\n- $K(t) = -f''(t)/f(t) = -(\\sinh t)/\\sinh t = -1$.\n- The ODE is $j''(t) - j(t) = 0$.\n- The general solution is $j(t) = C_1 \\cosh t + C_2 \\sinh t$.\n- Applying initial conditions:\n  - $j(0)=0 \\implies C_1 \\cosh 0 + C_2 \\sinh 0 = C_1 = 0$.\n  - $j'(t) = C_2 \\cosh t$. So $j'(0)=1 \\implies C_2 \\cosh 0 = C_2 = 1$.\n- The solution is $j(t) = \\sinh t$.\n- At $L=1$, $j(1) = \\sinh(1)$.\n\n#### Case C (Zero Curvature)\n- $f(t)=\\alpha t$ with $\\alpha=0.8$.\n- $f'(t)=\\alpha$, $f''(t)=0$.\n- $K(t) = -f''(t)/f(t) = -0/(\\alpha t) = 0$.\n- The ODE is $j''(t) = 0$.\n- The general solution is $j(t) = C_1 t + C_2$.\n- Applying initial conditions:\n  - $j(0)=0 \\implies C_1 \\cdot 0 + C_2 = C_2 = 0$.\n  - $j'(t) = C_1$. So $j'(0)=1 \\implies C_1 = 1$.\n- The solution is $j(t) = t$.\n- At $L=2$, $j(2) = 2$.\n\n#### Case D (Variable Curvature)\n- $f(t)=R + r \\cos(t/r)$ with $R=2, r=0.5$.\n- $f'(t) = -\\sin(t/r)$.\n- $f''(t) = -(1/r)\\cos(t/r)$.\n- $K(t) = -f''(t)/f(t) = \\frac{(1/r)\\cos(t/r)}{R+r\\cos(t/r)}$.\n- The ODE is $j''(t) + \\frac{(1/r)\\cos(t/r)}{R+r\\cos(t/r)}j(t) = 0$.\n- This linear second-order ODE with variable coefficients does not have a simple analytical solution. It must be solved numerically. We convert it to a system of two first-order ODEs. Let $y_1(t) = j(t)$ and $y_2(t) = j'(t)$.\n- The system is:\n  $$\n  y_1' = y_2\n  $$\n  $$\n  y_2' = -K(t) y_1 = -\\left(\\frac{(1/r)\\cos(t/r)}{R+r\\cos(t/r)}\\right) y_1\n  $$\n- The initial conditions are $y_1(0)=j(0)=0$ and $y_2(0)=j'(0)=1$.\n- We integrate this system from $t=0$ to $L=1.5$ to find $j(1.5) = y_1(1.5)$.
