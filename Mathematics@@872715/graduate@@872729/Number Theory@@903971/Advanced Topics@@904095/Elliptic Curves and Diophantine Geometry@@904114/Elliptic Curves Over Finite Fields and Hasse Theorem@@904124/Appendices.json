The number of solutions for $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_p$ to the equation $y^2 = f(x)$ depends on whether $f(x)$ is a quadratic residue, a quadratic non-residue, or zero modulo $p$. This can be expressed using the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{a}{p})$, which is defined for an integer $a$ and a prime $p$.\n- If $(\\frac{f(x)}{p}) = 1$, then $f(x)$ is a non-zero quadratic residue modulo $p$, and there are two solutions for $y$.\n- If $(\\frac{f(x)}{p}) = -1$, then $f(x)$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$, and there are no solutions for $y$.\n- If $(\\frac{f(x)}{p}) = 0$, then $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, and there is one solution for $y$, namely $y=0$.\n\nIn all cases, the number of solutions for $y$ is given by $1 + (\\frac{f(x)}{p})$. Therefore, we can express the total number of affine points as a sum over all $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$:\n$$\n\\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p} \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x^3 - x}{p}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe total cardinality of $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is then:\n$$\n\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p) = 1 + \\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p} \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x^3 - x}{p}\\right)\\right) = 1 + \\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p} 1 + \\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p} \\left(\\frac{x^3 - x}{p}\\right)\n$$\nThe first summation is simply the number of elements in $\\mathbb{F}_p$, which is $p$.\n$$\n\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p) = 1 + p + \\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p} \\left(\\frac{x^3 - x}{p}\\right)\n$$\nLet's analyze the remaining sum, which we denote by $S$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p} \\left(\\frac{x^3 - x}{p}\\right)\n$$\nWe can perform a change of variables in the summation. As $x$ runs through all elements of $\\mathbb{F}_p$, so does $-x$. Let's substitute $u = -x$.\n$$\nS = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{F}_p} \\left(\\frac{(-u)^3 - (-u)}{p}\\right) = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{F}_p} \\left(\\frac{-u^3 + u}{p}\\right) = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{F}_p} \\left(\\frac{-(u^3 - u)}{p}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the multiplicative property of the Legendre symbol, $(\\frac{ab}{p}) = (\\frac{a}{p})(\\frac{b}{p})$, we get:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{F}_p} \\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{u^3 - u}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right) \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{F}_p} \\left(\\frac{u^3 - u}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right) S\n$$\nThis gives us the equation $S = (\\frac{-1}{p}) S$, which can be rewritten as $S \\left(1 - (\\frac{-1}{p})\\right) = 0$.\n\nNow, we use the given condition that $p$ is an odd prime with $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. For any odd prime $p$, it is a standard result from number theory that the value of the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{-1}{p})$ is given by $(-1)^{(p-1)/2}$.\nSince $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, we can write $p = 4k+3$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$.\nThen, the exponent is $(p-1)/2 = (4k+3-1)/2 = (4k+2)/2 = 2k+1$, which is an odd integer.\nTherefore, $(\\frac{-1}{p}) = (-1)^{2k+1} = -1$.\nSubstituting this result into our equation for $S$:\n$$\nS(1 - (-1)) = 0 \\implies S(2) = 0 \\implies 2S = 0\n$$\nSince $S$ is a sum of integers, $S$ itself must be an integer. The only integer solution to $2S=0$ is $S=0$.\n\nHaving shown that the sum is zero, we can now find the exact cardinality of $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$:\n$$\n\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p) = p + 1 + S = p + 1 + 0 = p + 1\n$$\n\nNext, we must explain why this curve is supersingular for these primes. The explanation must use the definition of the trace of Frobenius and Hasse's theorem.\n\nThe trace of Frobenius of an elliptic curve $E$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$, denoted $a_p$, is defined by the relation:\n$$\n\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p) = p + 1 - a_p\n$$\nUsing our calculated cardinality for the curve $E: y^2 = x^3 - x$ with $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$:\n$$\na_p = p + 1 - \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p) = p + 1 - (p+1) = 0\n$$\nAn elliptic curve $E$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is defined to be supersingular if its trace of Frobenius $a_p$ is divisible by $p$, i.e., $a_p \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince we have found that $a_p = 0$ for the primes in question, and $0$ is divisible by any non-zero integer, the condition $a_p \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ is satisfied. This directly implies that the curve $E$ is supersingular for all primes $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nHasse's theorem on elliptic curves provides a fundamental bound on the trace of Frobenius:\n$$\n|a_p| \\le 2\\sqrt{p}\n$$\nNow, let's consider the interplay between the supersingularity condition and Hasse's bound. If a curve is supersingular, then $a_p = kp$ for some integer $k$. Combining this with the Hasse bound gives:\n$$\n|kp| \\le 2\\sqrt{p}\n$$\nSince $p>0$, we can divide by $\\sqrt{p}$:\n$$\n|k|\\sqrt{p} \\le 2\n$$\nIf we consider primes $p \\ge 5$, then $\\sqrt{p} > 2$. For the inequality $|k|\\sqrt{p} \\le 2$ to hold, we must have $|k| < 1$. Since $k$ is an integer, the only possibility is $k=0$. This implies that for any prime $p \\ge 5$, an elliptic curve is supersingular if and only if its trace of Frobenius is exactly $a_p = 0$.\nFor the case $p=3$, which satisfies $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the Hasse bound is $|a_3| \\le 2\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.46$. The supersingularity condition $a_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$ allows for the possibilities $a_3 \\in \\{-3, 0, 3\\}$.\nOur direct calculation that $a_p=0$ for all primes $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ is therefore fully consistent with the consequences of Hasse's bound and the definition of supersingularity. The computed trace $a_p=0$ satisfies the Hasse bound $|0| \\le 2\\sqrt{p}$ and also fulfills the divisibility requirement $0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. Thus, the curve is supersingular.\n\nThe final answer is the closed-form expression for $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{p})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{p+1}\n$$", "id": "3012997"}]}
