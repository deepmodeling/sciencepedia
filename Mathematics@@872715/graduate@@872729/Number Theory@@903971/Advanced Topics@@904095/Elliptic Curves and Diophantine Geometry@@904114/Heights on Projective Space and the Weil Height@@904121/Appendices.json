The subgroup $P_k\\subset I_k$ of principal fractional ideals has finite index; indeed, the quotient $I_k/P_k\\cong \\operatorname{Cl}_k$ is the ideal class group, which is finite. Therefore, $P_k$ is a subgroup of finite index in a free abelian group of infinite rank.

Properness is directly tied to the height machinery used in Mordell–Weil. The group $\\mathbb{G}_a(k)$ has only one torsion point, namely $0$, so it does not have infinitely many torsion points. The product formula does not imply that $k^\\times$ is finite; $k^\\times$ is infinite and, as explained, not finitely generated. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This option incorrectly claims that a finite-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is finitely generated as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module. As shown, even $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not finitely generated as an abelian group, hence neither is $k$. It also incorrectly concludes that $k^\\times/\\mathcal{O}_k^\\times$ is finite from the finiteness of the class group; although $I_k/P_k\\cong \\operatorname{Cl}_k$ is finite, the group $P_k$ itself is of infinite rank. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. The first sentence correctly notes that non-properness obstructs the construction of a positive-definite canonical height with the Northcott property. However, the claim that choosing generators of principal prime ideals yields infinitely many elements of uniformly bounded logarithmic height is not generally correct; the logarithmic heights of such generators typically grow with the norms of the prime ideals. Therefore, the asserted height-based demonstration for $\\mathbb{G}_m$ is flawed. The argument for $\\mathbb{G}_a(k)$ containing $\\mathbb{Q}$ is correct, but the option as a whole is not accurate.

The problem provides the qualitative form of Vojta’s conjecture for a variety $X$, a divisor $D$, a finite set of places $S$, any ample divisor $A$, and any $\\varepsilon > 0$.
