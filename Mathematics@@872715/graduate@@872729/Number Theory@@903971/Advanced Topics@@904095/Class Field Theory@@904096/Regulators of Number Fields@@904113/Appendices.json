No numerical approximation is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the regulator $R_K$ for the number field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The derivation must proceed from first principles, following the specified steps.\n\nFirst, we identify the given number field and its properties. The field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which is a real quadratic field of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d=2$. Since $d=2$ is a square-free integer and $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers of $K$ is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}]$. The elements of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ are of the form $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers, $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNext, we identify the embeddings of $K$ into the field of complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$. As $K$ is a real quadratic field, there are two distinct real embeddings and no non-real complex embeddings. These embeddings, $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2: K \\to \\mathbb{R}$, are given by:\n$\\sigma_1(a+b\\sqrt{2}) = a+b\\sqrt{2}$ (the identity embedding)\n$\\sigma_2(a+b\\sqrt{2}) = a-b\\sqrt{2}$ (the conjugation embedding)\nThe number of real embeddings is $r_1=2$, and the number of pairs of complex conjugate embeddings is $r_2=0$.\n\nAccording to the Dirichlet Unit Theorem, the group of units of $\\mathcal{O}_K$, denoted $\\mathcal{O}_K^\\times$, is a finitely generated abelian group with the structure $\\mathcal{O}_K^\\times \\cong \\mu(K) \\times \\mathbb{Z}^r$. Here, $\\mu(K)$ is the finite group of roots of unity in $K$, and the rank $r$ of the free part of the group is given by the formula $r = r_1 + r_2 - 1$. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the rank is $r = 2 + 0 - 1 = 1$. Since $K$ is a subfield of $\\mathbb{R}$, the only roots of unity it contains are $\\{1, -1\\}$, so $\\mu(K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, the unit group is $\\mathcal{O}_K^\\times \\cong \\{\\pm 1\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. This implies the existence of a fundamental unit, $\\epsilon > 1$, which generates the free part of the group. Any unit $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_K^\\times$ can be uniquely expressed as $u = \\pm \\epsilon^n$ for some integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTo find this fundamental unit $\\epsilon$, we must find the units in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. An element $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is a unit if and only if its field norm, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$, is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}$, which means $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\pm 1$. The norm is calculated as:\n$$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\\sqrt{2}) = (a+b\\sqrt{2})(a-b\\sqrt{2}) = a^2 - 2b^2$$\nFinding units is thus equivalent to finding integer solutions $(a, b)$ to the Pell-type equation $a^2 - 2b^2 = \\pm 1$. The fundamental unit is the smallest unit that is greater than $1$. We search for the solution with the smallest positive values of $a$ and $b$ that yields a unit greater than $1$. Let's test integer values for $b$, starting from $b=1$.\nFor $b=1$, the equation becomes $a^2 - 2(1)^2 = \\pm 1$, or $a^2 = 2 \\pm 1$.\nThe case $a^2 = 3$ yields no integer solution for $a$.\nThe case $a^2 = 1$ yields $a=1$ (we seek a unit greater than $1$, which implies $a>0, b>0$ for $a+b\\sqrt{2}$).\nThe solution $(a,b) = (1,1)$ gives the algebraic integer $1+\\sqrt{2}$. Its norm is $1^2 - 2(1)^2 = -1$, confirming it is a unit. Its value is $1+\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.414$, which is greater than $1$. As this unit arises from the smallest possible positive integer solution $(a,b)=(1,1)$ to the Pell-type equation, $1+\\sqrt{2}$ is the smallest unit greater than $1$. Thus, the fundamental unit of $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\epsilon = 1+\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the regulator $R_K$. The regulator is defined in terms of the logarithmic embedding of the units. For a general number field, the logarithmic map is $\\ell: \\mathcal{O}_K^\\times \\to \\mathbb{R}^{r_1+r_2}$, given by $u \\mapsto (\\log|\\sigma_1(u)|, \\dots, 2\\log|\\sigma_{r_1+r_2}(u)|)$. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, this becomes $\\ell: u \\mapsto (\\log|\\sigma_1(u)|, \\log|\\sigma_2(u)|)$. The regulator $R_K$ is the absolute value of the determinant of the $r \\times r$ matrix formed by taking the vectors $\\ell(\\epsilon_i)$ for a basis of fundamental units $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}_{i=1,\\dots,r}$ and dropping one of the rows (any one).\nIn our case, $r=1$, and the basis consists of the single fundamental unit $\\epsilon=1+\\sqrt{2}$. The logarithmic vector is:\n$$\\ell(\\epsilon) = (\\log|\\sigma_1(1+\\sqrt{2})|, \\log|\\sigma_2(1+\\sqrt{2})|)$$\n$$\\ell(\\epsilon) = (\\log|1+\\sqrt{2}|, \\log|1-\\sqrt{2}|) = (\\log(1+\\sqrt{2}), \\log(\\sqrt{2}-1))$$\nTo compute the regulator, we form a $1 \\times 1$ matrix by taking one component, for instance, the first one. The regulator is the absolute value of its determinant:\n$$R_K = |\\det(\\log(1+\\sqrt{2}))| = \\log(1+\\sqrt{2})$$\nThe value is positive since $1+\\sqrt{2} > 1$. If we had chosen the second component, we would get $|\\log(\\sqrt{2}-1)| = |-\\log(1+\\sqrt{2})| = \\log(1+\\sqrt{2})$, the same result. This is guaranteed because for any unit $u$, the sum of the components of $\\ell(u)$ is $\\log|N(u)| = \\log(1) = 0$.\nThe problem's mention of the \"covolume interpretation\" refers to the fact that $R_K$ is the volume of the fundamental domain of the lattice $\\ell(\\mathcal{O}_K^\\times / \\mu(K))$ in the trace-zero hyperplane. The calculation performed is precisely this volume. For a real quadratic field, the regulator is simply $R_K = \\log(\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the fundamental unit greater than $1$.\n\nThus, the exact value of the regulator for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\log(1+\\sqrt{2})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\ln(1+\\sqrt{2})}$$", "id": "3022829"}, {"introduction": "Not all number fields have an infinite group of units, and understanding these cases is just as crucial. This next exercise explores the Gaussian number field, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(i)$, where the rank of the unit group is zero.

Finally, apply the analytic class number formula to compute the exact value of the residue at $s=1$ of the Dedekind zeta function $\\zeta_{K}(s)$. Express your final answer as a closed-form analytic expression. No rounding is required.", "solution": "This problem concerns the Gaussian number field, defined as $K=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit satisfying $i^2 = -1$. We will follow the prescribed four steps to compute the residue of the Dedekind zeta function $\\zeta_{K}(s)$ at $s=1$.\n\nFirst, we determine the signature of $K$. The field extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ has degree $n = [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$, as the minimal polynomial of $i$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2+1=0$. The embeddings of $K$ into the field of complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ are determined by the images of $i$, which must be the roots of this polynomial. The roots are $i$ and $-i$. This gives two embeddings: the identity map $\\sigma_1(a+bi) = a+bi$ and the complex conjugation map $\\sigma_2(a+bi) = a-bi$. The number of real embeddings, $r_1$, is the number of embeddings $\\sigma_j$ such that $\\sigma_j(K) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. Since neither $i$ nor $-i$ are real numbers, there are no real embeddings, so $r_1=0$. The number of pairs of complex conjugate embeddings, $r_2$, is such that $n = r_1 + 2r_2$. Substituting the known values, we have $2 = 0 + 2r_2$, which yields $r_2=1$. The signature of $K$ is therefore $(r_1, r_2) = (0,1)$.\n\nNext, we find $w_K$, the number of roots of unity in $K$. The ring of integers of $K$ is the ring of Gaussian integers, $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[i]$. A root of unity $\\zeta \\in K$ must be an algebraic integer, so $\\zeta \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. Let $\\zeta = a+bi$ where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. It must also satisfy $|\\zeta|=1$. The squared norm is $N(\\zeta) = \\zeta\\overline{\\zeta} = a^2+b^2$, and for a root of unity, this must be $1$. The integer solutions to the equation $a^2+b^2=1$ are $(a,b) = (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)$. These correspond to the elements $\\{1, -1, i, -i\\}$. This is the cyclic group of order $4$, so the number of roots of unity is $w_K=4$.\n\nSecond, we analyze the structure of the unit group $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$. Dirichlet's unit theorem states that $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$ is an abelian group of rank $r = r_1+r_2-1$. Using our previously calculated signature, the rank is $r = 0+1-1=0$. A rank of $0$ implies that the free part of the unit group is trivial. Thus, the unit group consists solely of the roots of unity: $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times} = \\{1, -1, i, -i\\}$. The regulator $R_K$ is, by definition, the absolute value of the determinant of an $r \\times r$ matrix constructed from the logarithms of the absolute values of a set of fundamental units. Since the rank $r=0$, this requires finding the determinant of a $0 \\times 0$ matrix. By convention, the determinant of a $0 \\times 0$ matrix is $1$. Therefore, the regulator is $R_K=1$.\n\nThird, we determine the class number $h_K$ and the discriminant $D_K$. The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unique factorization domain (UFD). A fundamental theorem of algebraic number theory states that for a ring of integers, being a UFD is equivalent to being a principal ideal domain (PID). The class number $h_K$ is the order of the ideal class group, which measures the extent to which the ring of integers fails to be a PID. Since $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a PID, every ideal is principal, the ideal class group is trivial, and thus its order, the class number, is $h_K=1$. To find the discriminant, we can use the formula for a quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d$ square-free. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$, we have $d=-1$. Since $-1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the discriminant is given by $D_K = 4d = 4(-1) = -4$. The absolute value is $|D_K|=4$.\n\nFinally, we apply the analytic class number formula. This formula connects the invariants of a number field to the residue of its Dedekind zeta function at the simple pole $s=1$:\n$$ \\lim_{s \\to 1} (s-1)\\zeta_K(s) = \\frac{2^{r_1}(2\\pi)^{r_2} h_K R_K}{w_K \\sqrt{|D_K|}} $$\nWe have all the necessary components:\n- $r_1=0$\n- $r_2=1$\n- $h_K=1$\n- $R_K=1$\n- $w_K=4$\n- $|D_K|=4$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ \\lim_{s \\to 1} (s-1)\\zeta_K(s) = \\frac{2^0 (2\\pi)^1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}{4 \\sqrt{4}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot 2\\pi}{4 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} $$\nThe residue of $\\zeta_K(s)$ at $s=1$ is therefore $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. This result is famously connected to the Leibniz formula for $\\pi$, as it is equal to the value $L(1,\\chi_{-4}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\dots$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$$", "id": "3022871"}, {"introduction": "While direct calculation is feasible for simple fields, computing regulators for higher-degree fields requires a computational approach.

These roots correspond to the values of $\\theta$ under the embeddings. Roots with an imaginary part close to zero are classified as real. The remaining complex roots are grouped into conjugate pairs. We count the number of real roots, $r_1$, and complex conjugate pairs, $r_2$. The rank of the unit group is then $r = r_1+r_2-1$. If $r=0$, the regulator is $1$ by convention.\n\n2.  **Construct Logarithmic Embedding Vectors:** For each provided basis unit $u_i = p_{u_i}(\\theta)$, we first compute its image under each embedding by evaluating the polynomial $p_{u_i}(x)$ at the corresponding root of $f(x)$. We then construct the logarithmic vector $\\ell(u_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r_1+r_2}$ using the formula above.\n\n3.  **Ensure Numerical Stability via Projection:** Due to finite-precision arithmetic, the computed vectors $\\ell(u_i)$ may not have components that sum exactly to zero. To enforce this property and improve numerical stability, each vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\ell(u_i)$ is projected onto the hyperplane $H$ via the transformation $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{proj}} = \\mathbf{v} - \\bar{v}\\mathbf{1}$, where $\\bar{v}$ is the mean of the components of $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{1}$ is the vector of all ones.\n\n4.  **Compute Regulator via Minor Determinant:** The regulator is the absolute value of the determinant of any $r \\times r$ matrix formed by removing an arbitrary row from the $(r_1+r_2) \\times r$ matrix $L$ whose columns are the (projected) logarithmic embedding vectors. After forming the matrix $L$, we can, for instance, remove the first row to obtain an $r \\times r$ matrix $L'$. The regulator is then given by:\n    $$\n    R_K = |\\det(L')|\n    $$\n    The projection step in (3) ensures that this value is independent of the row chosen for deletion, even with numerical inaccuracies.\n\nThis procedure provides a complete and numerically stable algorithm for approximating the regulator.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_regulator(poly_f_asc, poly_units_asc):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the regulator of a number field K specified by a minimal polynomial\n    and a set of fundamental units.\n\n    Args:\n        poly_f_asc (list): Coefficients of the minimal polynomial f(x) of a\n                           primitive element theta, in ascending powers.\n        poly_units_asc (list): A list of polynomials representing the units.\n                               Each polynomial is a list of coefficients in\n                               ascending powers. u_i = p_i(theta).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The computed regulator R_K.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Numpy expects coefficients in descending order of powers.\n    poly_f_desc = np.array(poly_f_asc[::-1], dtype=float)\n\n    # Step 1: Compute embeddings and find the signature (r1, r2)\n    roots = np.roots(poly_f_desc)\n\n    real_roots = []\n    complex_reps = []\n    # A tolerance for classifying roots as real\n    tol = 1e-9\n\n    # Sort roots to have a canonical order\n    sorted_roots = sorted(roots, key=lambda z: (z.real, z.imag))\n    \n    processed_roots = set()\n    for z in sorted_roots:\n        if z in processed_roots:\n            continue\n        \n        if abs(z.imag)  tol:\n            real_roots.append(z.real)\n            processed_roots.add(z)\n        elif z.imag > 0: # Take only one from a conjugate pair\n            complex_reps.append(z)\n            processed_roots.add(z)\n            processed_roots.add(z.conjugate())\n\n    r1 = len(real_roots)\n    r2 = len(complex_reps)\n    rank = r1 + r2 - 1\n\n    # Handle r=0 case\n    if rank == 0:\n        return 1.0\n\n    # These are the specific roots corresponding to our chosen embeddings\n    embedding_roots = real_roots + complex_reps\n\n    # Step 2: Construct Logarithmic Embedding Vectors\n    log_vectors = []\n    for p_u_asc in poly_units_asc:\n        p_u_desc = np.array(p_u_asc[::-1], dtype=float)\n        log_vec = np.zeros(r1 + r2)\n\n        for i, z in enumerate(embedding_roots):\n            # Evaluate u = p_u(z)\n            u_val = np.polyval(p_u_desc, z)\n            \n            # Take log of absolute value\n            log_abs_u = np.log(np.abs(u_val))\n\n            # Weight by 1 for real, 2 for complex embeddings\n            weight = 1 if i  r1 else 2\n            log_vec[i] = weight * log_abs_u\n        \n        log_vectors.append(log_vec)\n    \n    # Step 3: Projection onto the trace-zero hyperplane for numerical stability\n    projected_vectors = []\n    for v in log_vectors:\n        v_proj = v - np.mean(v)\n        projected_vectors.append(v_proj)\n\n    # The number of provided units must match the rank\n    if len(projected_vectors) != rank:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Expected {rank} units for rank {rank} field, but got {len(projected_vectors)}.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Compute regulator via determinant of a minor\n    # Form the matrix L with projected vectors as columns\n    L = np.array(projected_vectors).T\n\n    # Delete the first row to get an r x r matrix.
