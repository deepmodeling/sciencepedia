Let $\\mathcal{O}_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$. For a rational prime $p$, the law of decomposition of the ideal $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ into prime ideals in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is determined by the value of the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)$.\n\n(a) Justification of the classification of prime splitting.\n\nA prime $p$ is said to ramify in $K$ if and only if $p$ divides the discriminant of the field, which is $d$. The Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)$ is defined to be $0$ if and only if $p|d$. Specifically: for an odd prime $p$, $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=0$ iff $p|d$; for $p=2$, $\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)=0$ iff $d$ is even, which for a fundamental discriminant means $d \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$ and thus $2|d$. Therefore, $p$ ramifies in $K$ if and only if $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=0$. This justifies the third case.\n\nTo analyze the unramified primes, where $p \\nmid d$ and $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right) \\in \\{1, -1\\}$, we use Dedekind's factorization theorem. This theorem relates the factorization of $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ to the factorization of the minimal polynomial of a generator $\\theta$ of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$, modulo $p$. We must consider two cases for the structure of $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nCase 1: $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nIn this case, $d$ is a square-free integer. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ with $\\theta = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$. The minimal polynomial of $\\theta$ is $f(x) = x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4}$. Since $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$, Dedekind's theorem applies for all primes $p$. The factorization of $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ mirrors the factorization of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$.\n\n- Let $p$ be an odd prime. The discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $1^2 - 4(1)(\\frac{1-d}{4}) = d$. The factorization of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ depends on whether its discriminant $d$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$.\n    - If $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=1$, $d$ is a nonzero square modulo $p$, so $f(x)$ has two distinct roots in $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Thus $f(x)$ factors into two distinct linear polynomials, and $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ splits into two distinct prime ideals: $p\\mathcal{O}_K=\\mathfrak{p}\\,\\overline{\\mathfrak{p}}$ with $N\\mathfrak{p}=p$.\n    - If $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=-1$, $d$ is a non-square modulo $p$, so $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Thus $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ remains prime (is inert), and $N(p\\mathcal{O}_K) = p^2$.\n\n- Let $p=2$. Since $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, $d$ is odd, so $2 \\nmid d$ and $2$ is unramified. We examine $f(x) = x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4}$ modulo $2$.\n    - If $\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)=1$, then by definition of the Kronecker symbol, $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. This implies $1-d$ is a multiple of $8$, so $\\frac{1-d}{4}$ is an even integer. Modulo $2$, $f(x) \\equiv x^2 - x \\equiv x(x-1) \\pmod 2$. The polynomial splits into two distinct linear factors. Thus, $2\\mathcal{O}_K$ splits.\n    - If $\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)=-1$, then $d \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$. This implies $1-d = 1-(8k+5) = -4-8k$, so $\\frac{1-d}{4} = -1-2k$ is an odd integer. Modulo $2$, $f(x) \\equiv x^2 - x + 1 \\equiv x^2+x+1 \\pmod 2$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Thus, $2\\mathcal{O}_K$ is inert.\n\nCase 2: $d=4m$ with $m$ square-free and $m \\equiv 2$ or $3 \\pmod 4$.\nThe ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K=\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ with $\\theta=\\sqrt{m}$. The minimal polynomial of $\\theta$ is $g(x)=x^2-m$.\n\n- Let $p$ be an odd prime. Since $p \\nmid d$, it follows that $p \\nmid m$. The factorization of $g(x)=x^2-m$ modulo $p$ depends on whether $m$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$, which is determined by the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right)$. We relate this to the Kronecker symbol: $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4m}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2^2}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right)$.\n    - If $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=1$, then $\\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right)=1$. So $x^2-m$ has two distinct roots modulo $p$. Thus $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ splits.\n    - If $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=-1$, then $\\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right)=-1$. So $x^2-m$ is irreducible modulo $p$. Thus $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ is inert.\n\n- For $p=2$, the discriminant $d=4m$ is even, so $2|d$. As established, this means $2$ ramifies and $\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)=0$. To verify with Dedekind's theorem, we check $g(x)=x^2-m$ modulo $2$.\n    - If $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$, $g(x) \\equiv x^2-2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$. It has a repeated root.\n    - If $m \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, $g(x) \\equiv x^2-3 \\equiv x^2+1 \\equiv (x+1)^2 \\pmod 2$. It also has a repeated root.\n    In both cases, $2\\mathcal{O}_K=\\mathfrak{p}^2$ for a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of norm $2$. This confirms that $2$ ramifies.\n\nThis comprehensive analysis demonstrates that for any prime $p$, the splitting behavior in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is correctly classified by the value of the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)$.\n\n(b) Density of splitting primes via Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\nThe extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, as $K$ is a quadratic field. The Galois group is $G = \\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = \\{1, \\sigma\\}$, where $1$ is the identity automorphism and $\\sigma$ is the non-trivial automorphism defined by $\\sigma(\\sqrt{d})=-\\sqrt{d}$. The order of the group is $|G|=2$. Since $G$ is abelian, every element forms its own conjugacy class. The conjugacy classes are $C_1 = \\{1\\}$ and $C_2 = \\{\\sigma\\}$.\n\nThe Chebotarev Density Theorem (CDT) states that for a given conjugacy class $C \\subseteq G$, the set of unramified primes $p$ of $\\mathbb{Q}$ whose Frobenius conjugacy class $\\mathrm{Frob}_p$ equals $C$ has a natural density of $\\frac{|C|}{|G|}$.\n\nWe need to identify which conjugacy class corresponds to the primes that split in $K$. A rational prime $p$ (unramified in $K$) splits in $K$ if and only if its residue degree $f$ is $1$. The Frobenius element $\\mathrm{Frob}_p$ is the element $\\phi \\in G$ that acts as the Frobenius automorphism on the residue field extension. Specifically, for a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{P}$ of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ above $p$, $\\phi(x) \\equiv x^p \\pmod{\\mathfrak{P}}$ for all $x \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\n- If $p$ splits, the residue degree is $f_p=1$. This means the residue field $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{P}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{F}_p$. For any element $y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$, we have $y^p=y$. So the condition becomes $\\phi(x) \\equiv x \\pmod{\\mathfrak{P}}$ for all $x \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. This implies that $\\phi$ is the identity element of the Galois group. Thus, for splitting primes, $\\mathrm{Frob}_p = \\{1\\}$.\n\n- If $p$ is inert, the residue degree is $f_p=2$. The residue field $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{P}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. The map $y \\mapsto y^p$ is the non-trivial Frobenius automorphism of $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}/\\mathbb{F}_p$. This corresponds to the action of the non-identity element $\\sigma \\in G$. So, for inert primes, $\\mathrm{Frob}_p = \\{\\sigma\\}$.\n\nFrom part (a), we know that a prime $p$ splits in $K$ if and only if $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=1$ (for unramified primes). We have just shown that $p$ splits if and only if $\\mathrm{Frob}_p = \\{1\\}$. Therefore, the condition $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=1$ is equivalent to the condition $\\mathrm{Frob}_p = \\{1\\}$ for unramified primes.\n\nWe are seeking the natural density of primes $p$ for which $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=1$. This is the density of primes for which $\\mathrm{Frob}_p = \\{1\\}$. The relevant conjugacy class is $C = \\{1\\}$, with size $|C|=1$. The size of the Galois group is $|G|=2$.\n\nApplying the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density is:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{|\\{1\\}|}{|\\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})|} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe set of ramified primes is finite (the prime factors of $d$), so its density is $0$. Thus, including them does not change the density calculation for the set of splitting primes.\nThe natural density of rational primes $p$ for which $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=1$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "3025445"}, {"introduction": "Cyclotomic fields provide a rich testing ground for the Chebotarev Density Theorem and are central to number theory.

The extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension. Its Galois group, $G = \\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is canonically isomorphic to the group of units of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$, denoted by $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The isomorphism is given by mapping an integer $a$ coprime to $m$ to the automorphism $\\sigma_a \\in G$ defined by $\\sigma_a(\\zeta_m) = \\zeta_m^a$. The order of this group is $|G| = \\varphi(m)$, where $\\varphi$ is Euler's totient function.\n\nThe field $K^{+} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m + \\zeta_m^{-1})$ is the subfield of $K$ fixed by the action of complex conjugation. Complex conjugation maps $\\zeta_m$ to $\\overline{\\zeta_m} = \\zeta_m^{-1}$. The corresponding automorphism in $G$ is $\\sigma_{-1}: \\zeta_m \\mapsto \\zeta_m^{-1}$. Let $H$ be the subgroup of $G$ corresponding to the Galois group $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/K^{+})$. By Galois theory, $K^{+}$ is precisely the fixed field of $H$. Since $K^{+}$ is the maximal real subfield, $H$ is the subgroup generated by complex conjugation, so $H = \\{\\operatorname{id}, \\sigma_{-1}\\}$. The identity element corresponds to $1 \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ and $\\sigma_{-1}$ to $-1 \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. Since $m \\geq 3$, we have $1 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod m$, so the subgroup $H$ has order $|H|=2$.\n\nThe extension $K^{+}/\\mathbb{Q}$ is also a Galois extension, as it is an intermediate field of a Galois extension and $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ (because $G$ is abelian). The Galois group of this extension is the quotient group $\\operatorname{Gal}(K^{+}/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong G/H$. The degree of this extension is $[K^{+}:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G/H| = |G|/|H| = \\frac{\\varphi(m)}{2}$.\n\nThe splitting behavior of a rational prime $p$ in a Galois extension of number fields is determined by its Frobenius element. A prime $p$ (which we assume does not ramify, i.e., $p \\nmid m$) splits completely in a Galois extension $F/\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if its Frobenius element, denoted $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$, is the identity element in $\\operatorname{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nWe are interested in the primes $p$ that split completely in $K^{+}/\\mathbb{Q}$. This is equivalent to the condition that the Frobenius element for the extension $K^{+}/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the identity. The Frobenius element for the extension a quotient field, $\\operatorname{Frob}_p(K^{+}/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the image of the Frobenius element for the larger extension, $\\operatorname{Frob}_p(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, under the natural projection map $\\pi: G \\to G/H$.\nTherefore, a prime $p$ splits completely in $K^{+}$ if and only if $\\pi(\\operatorname{Frob}_p(K/\\mathbb{Q}))$ is the identity in $G/H$. This is equivalent to the condition that $\\operatorname{Frob}_p(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ lies in the kernel of the projection $\\pi$, which is precisely the subgroup $H$.\nSo, the condition for a prime $p$ to split completely in $K^{+}$ is $\\operatorname{Frob}_p(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\in H = \\{\\operatorname{id}, \\sigma_{-1}\\}$.\n\nFor the cyclotomic extension $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)/\\mathbb{Q}$, the Frobenius element at an unramified prime $p$ is well-known to be the automorphism $\\sigma_p: \\zeta_m \\mapsto \\zeta_m^p$. Under the isomorphism $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, $\\operatorname{Frob}_p(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ corresponds to the residue class $p \\pmod m$. The subgroup $H$ corresponds to the set $\\{1, -1\\} \\subseteq (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$.\n\nThus, the condition $\\operatorname{Frob}_p(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\in H$ translates to the arithmetic condition $p \\pmod m \\in \\{1, -1\\}$. This means the primes that split completely in $K^{+}$ are precisely those primes $p$ (not dividing $m$) such that either $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$ or $p \\equiv -1 \\pmod m$.\n\nWe can now determine the natural density of this set of primes using the Chebotarev density theorem (CDT) or its specialization to abelian extensions, the Dirichlet theorem on arithmetic progressions. The CDT states that for a Galois extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ and a conjugacy class $C \\subseteq \\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$, the set of unramified primes $p$ whose Frobenius conjugacy class equals $C$ has natural density $\\frac{|C|}{|\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})|}$.\n\nIn our case, the extension is $K/\\mathbb{Q}$, which is abelian. Thus, every element of $G = \\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ forms its own conjugacy class of size $1$. We are interested in the set of primes where $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$ is either $\\operatorname{id}$ or $\\sigma_{-1}$.\n- The set of primes $S_1 = \\{p \\text{ prime} \\mid p \\equiv 1 \\pmod m\\}$ corresponds to $\\operatorname{Frob}_p = \\operatorname{id}$. According to CDT, its density is $\\delta(S_1) = \\frac{1}{|\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})|} = \\frac{1}{\\varphi(m)}$.\n- The set of primes $S_2 = \\{p \\text{ prime} \\mid p \\equiv -1 \\pmod m\\}$ corresponds to $\\operatorname{Frob}_p = \\sigma_{-1}$. Its density is $\\delta(S_2) = \\frac{1}{|\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})|} = \\frac{1}{\\varphi(m)}$.\n\nSince $m \\geq 3$, we have $1 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod m$, so the sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ are disjoint. The set of primes that split completely in $K^{+}$ is the disjoint union $S_1 \\cup S_2$ (ignoring the finite set of ramified primes, which has density $0$). The density of the union is the sum of the densities:\n$$ \\delta(S_1 \\cup S_2) = \\delta(S_1) + \\delta(S_2) = \\frac{1}{\\varphi(m)} + \\frac{1}{\\varphi(m)} = \\frac{2}{\\varphi(m)} $$\nThis is the natural density of primes that split completely in $K^{+}$.\n\nFor comparison, the density of primes that split completely in the full cyclotomic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{m})$ is the density of the set $S_1$ alone, which is $\\frac{1}{\\varphi(m)}$. This is because splitting completely in $K$ requires $\\operatorname{Frob}_p = \\operatorname{id}$, which corresponds to $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$.\nThe density of primes that split completely in $K^{+}$ is $\\frac{2}{\\varphi(m)}$, which is exactly twice the density of primes that split completely in $K$.
