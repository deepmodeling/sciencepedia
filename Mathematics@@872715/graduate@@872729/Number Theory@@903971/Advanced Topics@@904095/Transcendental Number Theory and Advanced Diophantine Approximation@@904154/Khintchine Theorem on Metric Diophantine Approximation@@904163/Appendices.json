The process will be conducted by adhering strictly to the provided definitions and first principles.\n\nLet $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\psi: \\mathbb{N} \\to (0,1)$. The set $E_q \\subset [0,1]$ is defined as\n$$\nE_q = \\bigcup_{a=0}^{q} I'_a, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad I'_a = \\left( \\left[ \\frac{a}{q} - \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q},\\, \\frac{a}{q} + \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} \\right] \\cap [0,1] \\right).\n$$\nHere, $m(\\cdot)$ denotes the Lebesgue measure.\n\nFirst, we derive the specified upper bound for $m(E_q)$. The set $E_q$ is a finite union of measurable sets $I'_a$. By the property of subadditivity of the Lebesgue measure, the measure of a union of sets is less than or equal to the sum of the measures of the individual sets.\n$$\nm(E_q) = m\\left(\\bigcup_{a=0}^{q} I'_a\\right) \\le \\sum_{a=0}^{q} m(I'_a).\n$$\nFor each $a \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, q\\}$, the set $I'_a$ is contained within the interval $I_a = \\left[ \\frac{a}{q} - \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q},\\, \\frac{a}{q} + \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} \\right]$. The length, or Lebesgue measure, of $I_a$ is\n$$\nm(I_a) = \\left(\\frac{a}{q} + \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{a}{q} - \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}\\right) = \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}.\n$$\nSince $I'_a \\subseteq I_a$, we have $m(I'_a) \\le m(I_a) = \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}$. The summation has $q+1$ terms, corresponding to $a=0, 1, \\dots, q$. Summing these upper bounds gives:\n$$\nm(E_q) \\le \\sum_{a=0}^{q} \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q} = (q+1) \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}.\n$$\nThis establishes the first inequality. To establish the second, we analyze the factor multiplying $\\psi(q)$:\n$$\n(q+1) \\frac{2}{q} = 2 \\frac{q+1}{q} = 2\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{q}\\right).\n$$\nSince $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $q \\ge 1$, which implies $0  \\frac{1}{q} \\le 1$. Therefore, $1  1 + \\frac{1}{q} \\le 2$. This leads to:\n$$\n2\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{q}\\right) \\psi(q) \\le 2(2) \\psi(q) = 4\\psi(q).\n$$\nCombining these results, we have shown from first principles that\n$$\nm(E_q) \\le 2(q+1)\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} \\le 4\\psi(q).\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the sharpness of this bound by computing $m(E_q)$ exactly under the specific condition $0  \\psi(q) \\le \\frac{1}{2}$. We must first determine if the intervals constituting $E_q$ are disjoint under this condition. Let us consider the full intervals $I_a = \\left[ \\frac{a}{q} - \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q},\\, \\frac{a}{q} + \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} \\right]$. The centers of two adjacent intervals, $I_a$ and $I_{a+1}$, are $\\frac{a}{q}$ and $\\frac{a+1}{q}$. The distance between these centers is $\\frac{1}{q}$. The radius of each interval is $r = \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}$. For these two intervals to be disjoint, the distance between their centers must be at least the sum of their radii, which is $2r = \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}$.\nThe condition for disjointness (or touching at endpoints) is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{q} \\ge \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q} \\iff 1 \\ge 2\\psi(q) \\iff \\psi(q) \\le \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThis is precisely the assumption given. Therefore, under the condition $\\psi(q) \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, the intervals $I_a$ for $a \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, q\\}$ are pairwise disjoint. Since $I'_a \\subset I_a$, the sets $I'_a$ are also pairwise disjoint.\nThis disjointness implies that the measure of the union is the sum of the measures:\n$$\nm(E_q) = m\\left(\\bigcup_{a=0}^{q} I'_a\\right) = \\sum_{a=0}^{q} m(I'_a).\n$$\nWe now compute the measure of each $I'_a$:\n1.  For $a=0$: $I'_0 = \\left[ -\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}, \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} \\right] \\cap [0,1] = \\left[0, \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}\\right]$. Thus, $m(I'_0) = \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}$.\n2.  For $a=q$: $I'_q = \\left[ 1-\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}, 1+\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} \\right] \\cap [0,1] = \\left[1-\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}, 1\\right]$. Thus, $m(I'_q) = 1 - \\left(1-\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}\\right) = \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}$.\n3.  For $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, q-1\\}$: The interval is $I_a = \\left[ \\frac{a-\\psi(q)}{q}, \\frac{a+\\psi(q)}{q} \\right]$. We verify if it lies entirely within $[0,1]$.\n    The left endpoint is $\\frac{a-\\psi(q)}{q}$. Since $a \\ge 1$ and $\\psi(q) \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $a-\\psi(q) \\ge 1-\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} > 0$.\n    The right endpoint is $\\frac{a+\\psi(q)}{q}$. Since $a \\le q-1$ and $\\psi(q) \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $a+\\psi(q) \\le (q-1)+\\frac{1}{2} = q-\\frac{1}{2}  q$.\n    Thus, for $a \\in \\{1, \\dots, q-1\\}$, the interval $I_a$ is fully contained in $(0,1)$, meaning $I'_a = I_a$. The measure is $m(I'_a) = m(I_a) = \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}$.\n\nSumming these measures:\nIf $q=1$, the indices are $a=0,1$. $m(E_1) = m(I'_0) + m(I'_1) = \\frac{\\psi(1)}{1} + \\frac{\\psi(1)}{1} = 2\\psi(1)$.\nIf $q \\ge 2$, there are $q-1$ interior intervals.\n$$\nm(E_q) = m(I'_0) + m(I'_q) + \\sum_{a=1}^{q-1} m(I'_a) = \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} + \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} + (q-1) \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}\n$$\n$$\nm(E_q) = \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q} + \\frac{(2q-2)\\psi(q)}{q} = \\frac{(2 + 2q - 2)\\psi(q)}{q} = \\frac{2q\\psi(q)}{q} = 2\\psi(q).\n$$\nThe formula $m(E_q) = 2\\psi(q)$ holds for $q=1$ as well. Thus, for any $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any function $\\psi$ such that $0  \\psi(q) \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, the exact measure is $m(E_q)=2\\psi(q)$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to find the smallest constant $C  0$ such that the uniform inequality $m(E_q) \\le C\\psi(q)$ holds for all $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and all $\\psi(q) \\in (0, \\frac{1}{2}]$.\nFrom our exact computation, we have $m(E_q) = 2\\psi(q)$ for all parameters in the specified range.

Since we found that the ratio $\\frac{m(E_q)}{\\psi(q)}$ is always equal to $2$, the supremum of this ratio over the domain is $2$.\nFor the inequality $\\frac{m(E_q)}{\\psi(q)} \\le C$ to hold universally, $C$ must be greater than or equal to this supremum.

Let $E_q$ be the set of $x \\in [0,1]$ satisfying the inequality for a given $q$:\n$$\nE_q = \\{ x \\in [0,1] : \\|q x\\|  \\psi(q) \\}.\n$$\nThen $W(\\psi) = \\bigcap_{N=1}^\\infty \\bigcup_{q=N}^\\infty E_q = \\limsup_{q\\to\\infty} E_q$.\n\nThe condition $\\|q x\\|  \\psi(q)$ means that there exists an integer $p$ such that $|q x - p|  \\psi(q)$, which is equivalent to $x \\in \\left(\\frac{p-\\psi(q)}{q}, \\frac{p+\\psi(q)}{q}\\right)$.\nTo find the measure of $E_q$, we consider the union of these intervals intersected with $[0,1]$:\n$$\nE_q = \\bigcup_{p=0}^{q} \\left(\\frac{p-\\psi(q)}{q}, \\frac{p+\\psi(q)}{q}\\right) \\cap [0,1].\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\psi(q) \\in [0, 1/4]$, which ensures $2\\psi(q) \\le 1/2  1$. This guarantees that the intervals for different values of $p$ are disjoint.\nThe length of an interior interval (for $p = 1, \\dots, q-1$) is $\\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}$. There are $q-1$ such intervals.\nThe intervals at the endpoints ($p=0$ and $p=q$) contribute lengths of $\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}$ each within $[0,1]$.\nThe total measure is the sum of the lengths of these disjoint intervals:\n$$\nm(E_q) = (q-1) \\cdot \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} = \\frac{2(q-1)\\psi(q) + 2\\psi(q)}{q} = \\frac{2q\\psi(q)}{q} = 2\\psi(q).\n$$\nThe problem of determining $m(W(\\psi))$ is related to the convergence or divergence of the series $\\sum_{q=1}^\\infty m(E_q) = 2\\sum_{q=1}^\\infty \\psi(q)$. The first Borel–Cantelli lemma states that if this series converges, then $m(W(\\psi))=0$. The second Borel–Cantelli lemma states that if the series diverges AND the events $E_q$ are independent, then $m(W(\\psi))=1$. However, the events $E_q$ are not independent.\n\nThe definitive result for this problem is Khintchine's theorem for one-dimensional inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation. It states:\nLet $\\psi: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$ be a function.\n1.  **Convergence Case:** If $\\sum_{q=1}^\\infty \\psi(q)$ converges, then $m(W(\\psi)) = 0$.\n2.  **Divergence Case:** If $\\psi$ is a nonincreasing function and $\\sum_{q=1}^\\infty \\psi(q)$ diverges, then $m(W(\\psi)) = 1$.\n\nThe problem states that $\\psi$ is constructed to be nonincreasing on $\\mathbb{N}$. We must therefore analyze the convergence of the series $\\sum_{q=1}^\\infty \\psi(q)$. Since the sum's convergence is determined by its tail, we study $\\sum_{q=q_0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{q\\,\\log q\\,\\log\\log q}$.\n\nWe use the Integral Test for series convergence. The function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x\\,\\log x\\,\\log\\log x}$ is positive and decreasing for $x \\ge q_0$. The series converges if and only if the integral $\\int_{q_0}^\\infty f(x) \\,dx$ converges.\n$$\n\\int_{q_0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{x\\,\\log x\\,\\log\\log x} \\,dx\n$$\nWe perform a substitution. Let $u = \\log x$, so $du = \\frac{1}{x} \\,dx$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $u \\to \\infty$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\log q_0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{u\\,\\log u} \\,du\n$$\nWe perform a second substitution. Let $v = \\log u$, so $dv = \\frac{1}{u} \\,du$. As $u \\to \\infty$, $v \\to \\infty$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\log(\\log q_0)}^\\infty \\frac{1}{v} \\,dv = \\left[ \\log v \\right]_{\\log(\\log q_0)}^\\infty = \\lim_{V\\to\\infty} \\log V - \\log(\\log(\\log q_0)) = \\infty.\n$$\nSince the integral diverges, the series $\\sum_{q=q_0}^\\infty \\psi(q)$ diverges by the Integral Test. Consequently, the full series $\\sum_{q=1}^\\infty \\psi(q)$ also diverges.\n\nWe have a nonincreasing function $\\psi$ for which $\\sum \\psi(q)$ diverges. By the divergence part of Khintchine's theorem, we conclude that $m(W(\\psi)) = 1$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For $q \\ge q_0$, the series $\\sum_{q=q_0}^{\\infty} \\psi(q)$ diverges, and since $\\psi$ is eventually nonincreasing, the divergence half of Khintchine's theorem applies to yield $m(W(\\psi)) = 1$.**\nOur analysis confirms every part of this statement. We proved that the series $\\sum_{q=q_0}^{\\infty} \\psi(q)$ diverges using the integral test. The problem specifies that $\\psi$ is made nonincreasing on all of $\\mathbb{N}$, which is a sufficient condition. Applying the divergence part of Khintchine's theorem correctly yields $m(W(\\psi)) = 1$. Hence, this statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. The series $\\sum_{q=q_0}^{\\infty} \\psi(q)$ converges, and by the first Borel–Cantelli lemma, $m(W(\\psi)) = 0$.**\nThe premise that the series converges is false, as we have shown it diverges. Therefore, this statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Although $\\sum_{q=q_0}^{\\infty} \\psi(q)$ diverges, the dependence among the events $\\{\\|q x\\|  \\psi(q)\\}$ prevents any divergence law from yielding full measure, so in fact $m(W(\\psi)) = 0$.**\nThis statement is a common misconception. While the events $E_q$ are indeed not independent, the nonincreasing condition on $\\psi$ in Khintchine's theorem is precisely the sufficient condition needed to overcome this dependence and prove the full measure result. The theorem shows that the dependence does not prevent the divergence law from applying. The conclusion $m(W(\\psi))=0$ is false. Therefore, this statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. To obtain full measure, one must replace $\\psi(q)$ by a slower-decaying function of the form $\\psi(q) = 1/\\big(q\\,(\\log q)\\,(\\log\\log q)^{\\alpha}\\big)$ with some $\\alpha > 0$, since the given $\\psi$ decays too fast for full measure.**\nOur result is that for the given $\\psi$ (which corresponds to $\\alpha=1$), the measure is already full ($m(W(\\psi))=1$). The premise that the function decays \"too fast for full measure\" is false. Therefore, this statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. For the one-parameter family $\\psi_{\\alpha}(q) = 1/\\big(q\\,(\\log q)\\,(\\log\\log q)^{\\alpha}\\big)$ defined for all $q \\ge q_0(\\alpha)$ large enough so that $\\log\\log q  0$ and extended to be nonincreasing on $\\mathbb{N}$, one has $m(W(\\psi_{\\alpha})) = 1$ if and only if $\\alpha \\le 1$, and $m(W(\\psi_{\\alpha})) = 0$ if $\\alpha  1$, by the divergence/convergence of $\\sum_{q} \\psi_{\\alpha}(q)$ together with the zero–one law provided by Khintchine's theorem in one dimension.**\nWe analyze the series $\\sum \\psi_{\\alpha}(q)$ using the same integral test as before.\n$$\n\\int^\\infty \\frac{dx}{x\\,\\log x\\,(\\log\\log x)^\\alpha} \\quad \\xrightarrow{v=\\log\\log x} \\quad \\int^\\infty \\frac{dv}{v^\\alpha}.\n$$\nThis p-integral converges if and only if $\\alpha > 1$, and diverges if and only if $\\alpha \\le 1$.\nThe function $\\psi_{\\alpha}(q)$ can be extended to be nonincreasing on $\\mathbb{N}$ for any $\\alpha$. Applying Khintchine's theorem gives:\n- If $\\alpha \\le 1$, $\\sum \\psi_\\alpha(q)$ diverges $\\implies m(W(\\psi_\\alpha))=1$.\n- If $\\alpha > 1$, $\\sum \\psi_\\alpha(q)$ converges $\\implies m(W(\\psi_\\alpha))=0$.\nThis matches the statement in the option perfectly. The problem's specific function corresponds to the borderline case $\\alpha=1$, which correctly falls into the divergence category. This statement provides a complete and correct picture of the behavior for this family of functions. Hence, this statement is **Correct**.\n\nBoth statements A and E are correct.
