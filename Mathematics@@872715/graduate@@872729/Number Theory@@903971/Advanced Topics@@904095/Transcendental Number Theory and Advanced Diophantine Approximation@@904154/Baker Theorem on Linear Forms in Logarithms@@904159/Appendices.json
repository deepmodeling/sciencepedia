The concepts of number fields, logarithmic heights, and linear forms in logarithms are standard in this domain.\n    2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific linear form, a defined context (the field $\\mathbb{Q}$), and a clear procedure for applying a specific theorem. The goal is to compute a single, concrete value (an analytic expression for the bound).

It is a valid problem in number theory.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary task is to determine if the set of integers $\\{6, 10, 15\\}$ is multiplicatively independent. By definition, this requires checking if the only integer solution $(x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3$ to the equation\n$$\n6^x 10^y 15^z = 1\n$$\nis the trivial solution $(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\nA standard and effective method for this is to use prime factorization. The prime factors involved are $2$, $3$, and $5$. We can write the base integers in terms of these primes:\n*   $6 = 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^0$\n*   $10 = 2^1 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^1$\n*   $15 = 2^0 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1$\n\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$$\n(2^1 \\cdot 3^1)^x (2^1 \\cdot 5^1)^y (3^1 \\cdot 5^1)^z = 1\n$$\nUsing the laws of exponents, we gather the powers of each prime:\n$$\n2^{x+y} \\cdot 3^{x+z} \\cdot 5^{y+z} = 2^0 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^0\n$$\nBy the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (uniqueness of prime factorization), the exponents of each corresponding prime base must be equal. This yields a system of linear homogeneous equations for the integer unknowns $x, y, z$:\n1.  $x + y = 0$\n2.  $x + z = 0$\n3.  $y + z = 0$\n\nWe can solve this system. From equation (1), $y = -x$. From equation (2), $z = -x$. Substituting these into equation (3) gives:\n$$\n(-x) + (-x) = 0 \\implies -2x = 0 \\implies x = 0\n$$\nSince $x=0$, it follows that $y = -0 = 0$ and $z = -0 = 0$. The only integer solution is $(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\nTherefore, the set $\\{6, 10, 15\\}$ is multiplicatively independent.\n\nThis analysis corresponds to the first part of the method requested in the problem. The second part involves applying Baker's theorem. The analysis above proves that the linear form $\\Lambda(x, y, z) = x \\log 6 + y \\log 10 + z \\log 15$ is equal to zero if and only if $(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$. For any non-zero triple of integers $(x, y, z)$, the linear form is non-zero. Baker's theorem then provides a quantitative statement about these non-zero values: there exist effectively computable constants $c > 0$ and $A > 0$ such that for any $(x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3 \\setminus \\{(0, 0, 0)\\}$,\n$$\n|x \\log 6 + y \\log 10 + z \\log 15| > c \\cdot (\\max\\{|x|, |y|, |z|\\})^{-A}\n$$\nThis theorem provides a \"repulsion\" property, guaranteeing that no non-trivial integer combination of these logarithms can be arbitrarily close to zero. This is crucial for, among other things, establishing the rigor of numerical checks.\n\nWith this foundation, we can evaluate the provided options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Factor each integer: $6=2\\cdot 3$, $10=2\\cdot 5$, $15=3\\cdot 5$. Introduce unknowns $(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{Z}^3$ for the exponents of $(6,10,15)$. Apply the $p$-adic valuations $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_5$ to the identity $6^x 10^y 15^z=1$ to obtain linear equations $x+y=0$, $x+z=0$, $y+z=0$, whose only integer solution is $(x,y,z)=(0,0,0)$; hence the set is multiplicatively independent. Furthermore, Baker’s theorem yields effectively computable constants $c,A>0$ (depending only on $6,10,15$) such that for any $(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{Z}^3\\setminus\\{(0,0,0)\\}$ with $H=\\max\\{|x|,|y|,|z|\\}$ one has $\\left|x\\log 6+y\\log 10+z\\log 15\\right|> c\\,H^{-A}$. Consequently, any high-precision numerical check of $\\Lambda(x,y,z)$ to accuracy $<\\tfrac{1}{2}c\\,H^{-A}$ can certify that no accidental near-cancellation occurs for a given $(x,y,z)$, and combined with the valuation test (which already excludes nontrivial solutions), this yields a rigorous verification.**\n\nThis option accurately describes the two-part process. The first part, using $p$-adic valuations (which is a formal way of stating the exponent counting from prime factorization), correctly derives the linear system and its unique trivial solution, proving multiplicative independence. The second part correctly states the consequence of Baker's theorem for this set and correctly explains its utility in providing rigorous certification for numerical computations by establishing a minimum distance from zero. The entire description is mathematically sound and follows the structure requested by the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Observe that $\\log 6/\\log 10$ is irrational, which implies that $\\log 6,\\log 10,\\log 15$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, without any further work, the set is multiplicatively independent.**\n\nThis option contains a severe logical flaw. The irrationality of $\\log 6 / \\log 10$ establishes the multiplicative independence of $\\{6, 10\\}$, which is equivalent to the linear independence of $\\{\\log 6, \\log 10\\}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. However, the linear independence of a subset does not imply the linear independence of the entire set. For a counterexample, the set $\\{\\log 2, \\log 3\\}$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$, but the set $\\{\\log 2, \\log 3, \\log 6\\}$ is not, since $\\log 6 - \\log 2 - \\log 3 = 0$. The reasoning presented is invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Compute the $3\\times 3$ matrix whose first row is $(\\log 6,\\log 10,\\log 15)$ and remaining rows are $(1,1,1)$ and $(0,0,0)$, and check numerically that its determinant is nonzero. This numerical nonvanishing suffices to prove multiplicative independence, making any appeal to Baker’s theorem unnecessary.**\n\nThis option is nonsensical. Any matrix with a row consisting entirely of zeros has a determinant of zero. Therefore, the determinant of the proposed matrix is always $0$, regardless of the other entries. Furthermore, a \"numerical check\" for non-vanishing is not a rigorous proof in general, as a true zero value might be computed as a small non-zero floating-point number due to precision errors. The claim that this suffices and makes Baker's theorem unnecessary is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A necessary and sufficient condition for multiplicative independence of integers $a_1,\\dots,a_n\\ge 2$ is that they be pairwise coprime. Since $6,10,15$ are not pairwise coprime, they are multiplicatively dependent.**\n\nThis statement is mathematically false. While being pairwise coprime is a *sufficient* condition for multiplicative independence, it is not a *necessary* one. As proven above, the set $\\{6, 10, 15\\}$ is multiplicatively independent, yet its members are not pairwise coprime (e.g., $\\gcd(6, 10) = 2 \\neq 1$). The conclusion drawn from the false premise is also incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Baker’s theorem states that any nontrivial linear form $\\sum_i b_i \\log a_i$ is bounded away from $0$, so there can never be an exact relation $\\prod_i a_i^{b_i}=1$ with integers $b_i$ unless all $b_i=0$. Therefore, one can skip checking integer solutions and directly conclude multiplicative independence from Baker’s theorem alone.**\n\nThis option misinterprets the logical structure of Baker's theorem. The theorem's premise is that the linear form in logarithms is *non-zero*. It states: IF $\\sum_i b_i \\log a_i \\neq 0$, THEN $|\\sum_i b_i \\log a_i| > \\text{bound}$. It does not, by itself, prove that the form is non-zero for non-trivial integer coefficients $b_i$. That is a separate question—the very question of multiplicative independence. One cannot use a theorem whose hypothesis is `P` to prove `P`. The check for integer solutions (as in option A) is precisely the step required to establish that the linear form is non-zero for non-trivial coefficients.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3008814"}, {"introduction": "The true power of Baker's theorem is revealed in its applications to Diophantine equations.

Use the lower bound to deduce\n$$\ny \\leq Y_{\\mathrm{Baker}} := \\left\\lfloor \\log_{b}\\!\\big(2|c|/L\\big) \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\log_{b}\\!\\big(2|c|\\,U^{K}\\big) \\right\\rfloor.\n$$\n4. Set the maximum $y$ to enumerate as\n$$\ny_{\\max} = \\min\\!\\big(B_{\\mathrm{enum}},\\,\\max(1,\\,\\max(Y_{\\mathrm{Baker}},\\,y_{\\tfrac{1}{2}}-1))\\big).\n$$\n5. For each $y$ in $1 \\leq y \\leq y_{\\max}$, apply modular pruning with a small suite of moduli (for example $m \\in \\{4,5,7,8,9,11,13\\}$). If any modulus rules out $y$, skip it. Otherwise, perform targeted enumeration of $x$:\n   - If $y < y_{\\tfrac{1}{2}}$, enumerate all $x$ with $1 \\leq x \\leq B_{\\mathrm{enum}}$.\n   - If $y \\geq y_{\\tfrac{1}{2}}$, use the inequality\n     $$\n     \\big|x - y \\tfrac{\\log b}{\\log a}\\big| \\leq \\frac{2|c|}{b^{y}\\log a}\n     $$\n     to restrict $x$ to a narrow interval around $y \\frac{\\log b}{\\log a}$, and only enumerate integer $x$ within a small safety margin of that interval (you may expand the interval by a small fixed integer margin to account for coarse constants).\n   - For each candidate $x$ in the narrowed interval, check whether $a^{x} - b^{y} = c$ holds in exact integer arithmetic.\n6. If any $(x,y)$ pair satisfies the equation, then small-exponent solutions have not been ruled out; return a boolean value of $\\mathrm{False}$ for that test case. Otherwise, return $\\mathrm{True}$ indicating that, with the given explicit bound and modular constraints, small-exponent solutions up to the prescribed range are ruled out.\n\nTest Suite and required final output:\n\nUse the following six test cases, each given as $(a,b,c,B_{\\mathrm{enum}},U,K)$ with $\\log$ as the natural logarithm:\n\n- Case $1$: $(2,3,5,50,1000,6)$.\n- Case $2$: $(3,2,7,50,1000,6)$.\n- Case $3$: $(5,3,2,30,1000,6)$.\n- Case $4$: $(7,2,3,40,1000,6)$.\n- Case $5$: $(2,3,-1,50,1000,6)$.\n- Case $6$: $(2,3,4,50,1000,6)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[r_{1},r_{2},\\dots,r_{6}]$), where each $r_{i}$ is a boolean indicating whether small-exponent solutions have been ruled out for that case by the described strategy. No physical units or angle units are involved; all logarithms are natural logarithms, and the output must be in the exact specified list format.", "solution": "The problem provides a detailed algorithm for finding or ruling out small-exponent integer solutions $(x,y)$ to the exponential Diophantine equation $a^x - b^y = c$. The approach combines a theoretical bound derived from Baker's theory of linear forms in logarithms with practical computational search techniques, namely modular arithmetic and targeted enumeration.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\nFirst, a critical validation of the problem statement is performed.\n\n1.  **Givens Extraction**:\n    -   The equation is $a^x - b^y = c$ for integers $x \\geq 1$, $y \\geq 1$.\n    -   Constants are integers $a \\geq 2$, $b \\geq 2$, and $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    -   The algorithm is defined by a sequence of computational steps involving:\n        -   An enumeration bound $B_{\\mathrm{enum}}$.\n        -   Parameters $U, K$ for an explicit lower bound $|\\Lambda(x,y)| \\geq U^{-K}$ on the linear form in logarithms $\\Lambda(x,y) = x \\log a - y \\log b$.\n        -   A threshold $y_{\\tfrac{1}{2}} = \\lceil \\log_{b}(2|c|) \\rceil$.\n        -   An upper bound $Y_{\\mathrm{Baker}} = \\lfloor \\log_{b}(2|c|\\,U^{K}) \\rfloor$.\n        -   A search limit $y_{\\max} = \\min(B_{\\mathrm{enum}}, \\max(1, \\max(Y_{\\mathrm{Baker}}, y_{\\tfrac{1}{2}}-1)))$.\n        -   Modular pruning using moduli $m \\in \\{4,5,7,8,9,11,13\\}$.\n        -   Targeted enumeration for $x$, with the search interval for $y \\ge y_{\\tfrac{1}{2}}$ given by $|x - y\\frac{\\log b}{\\log a}| \\le \\frac{2|c|}{b^y \\log a}$.\n    -   The test suite consists of six tuples $(a,b,c,B_{\\mathrm{enum}},U,K)$.\n\n2.  **Validation Check**:\n    -   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in number theory. The use of linear forms in logarithms is a standard and powerful technique for solving Diophantine equations. The inequalities presented are mathematically correct consequences of the theory.\n    -   **Well-Posedness**: The problem specifies a deterministic algorithm with clear inputs and a uniquely defined output format. The computational steps are unambiguous, leading to a single, verifiable result for each test case.\n    -   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language, free from any subjectivity.\n    -   **Completeness and Consistency**: All required constants, formulas, and test cases are provided. The theoretical underpinnings are consistent with the algorithmic steps. The minor ambiguity of a \"small safety margin\" is a practical detail in implementation and can be resolved by choosing a reasonable fixed integer, such as $2$. The assumption $c \\neq 0$ is implicit in the formulas involving $\\log|c|$ and holds for all test cases. The multiplicative independence of $(a,b)$ pairs is also satisfied for all test cases, ensuring $\\Lambda(x,y) \\neq 0$.\n\n3.  **Verdict**: The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution involves implementing the algorithm as described. A function is designed to process each test case, returning `True` if no solution is found within the specified search space (i.e., solutions are ruled out) and `False` if a solution is found.\n\nThe main steps for a given test case $(a,b,c,B_{\\mathrm{enum}},U,K)$ are as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization and Pre-computation**:\n    -   The set of moduli for pruning is $M = \\{4,5,7,8,9,11,13\\}$.\n    -   To apply modular constraints efficiently, for each modulus $m \\in M$, we pre-compute the set of residues $R_m = \\{a^x \\pmod m \\mid x \\ge 1\\}$. This set is finite since the sequence of powers is periodic.\n\n2.  **Compute Search Bounds for $y$**:\n    -   The threshold $y_{\\tfrac{1}{2}}$ is computed. For $y \\ge y_{\\tfrac{1}{2}}$, the inequality $|\\log(1 + c/b^y)| \\le 2|c|/b^y$ is valid.\n        $y_{\\tfrac{1}{2}} = \\max(1, \\lceil \\log_b(2|c|) \\rceil)$.\n    -   The theoretical upper bound on $y$ from Baker's method is computed:\n        $Y_{\\mathrm{Baker}} = \\lfloor \\log_b(2|c|\\,U^K) \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{\\log(2|c|) + K\\log U}{\\log b} \\rfloor$.\n    -   The final effective search limit for $y$ is determined by combining these with the given enumeration bound $B_{\\mathrm{enum}}$:\n        $y_{\\max} = \\min(B_{\\mathrm{enum}}, \\max(1, Y_{\\mathrm{Baker}}, y_{\\tfrac{1}{2}}-1))$.\n\n3.  **Iterative Search**: The algorithm iterates through each integer $y$ from $1$ to $y_{\\max}$. For each $y$:\n\n    -   **Modular Pruning**: Each modulus $m \\in M$ is used to test for the possibility of a solution. For a given $y$, we compute the right-hand side of the congruence $a^x \\equiv b^y+c \\pmod m$. If this value, $(b^y+c) \\pmod m$, is not in the pre-computed set of residues $R_m$, then no integer $x \\ge 1$ can satisfy the congruence. Thus, this value of $y$ is ruled out, and the algorithm proceeds to the next $y$.\n\n    -   **Targeted Enumeration of $x$**: If $y$ survives the modular pruning, a search for $x$ is conducted.\n        -   If $y < y_{\\tfrac{1}{2}}$, the linear form approximation is not guaranteed. A direct search for $x$ is performed from $1$ to $B_{\\mathrm{enum}}$.\n        -   If $y \\ge y_{\\tfrac{1}{2}}$, we use the inequality $|x \\log a - y \\log b| \\le \\frac{2|c|}{b^y}$, which implies $|x - y\\frac{\\log b}{\\log a}| \\le \\frac{2|c|}{b^y\\log a}$. This confines $x$ to a very small interval around the real number $y \\frac{\\log b}{\\log a}$. We enumerate integers $x$ in this interval, expanded by a small safety margin (e.g., $2$ on each side) to account for approximations.\n\n    -   **Solution Check**: For each candidate pair $(x,y)$ generated, the equation $a^x - b^y = c$ is checked using exact integer arithmetic. Python's arbitrary-precision integers are suitable for this, as the powers can become very large. If a solution is found, the function immediately returns `False`.\n\n4.  **Final Result**: If the entire loop over $y$ from $1$ to $y_{\\max}$ completes without finding any solution, the function returns `True`, indicating that small-exponent solutions have been ruled out under the given constraints.\n\nAs an example, for Case 6, $2^x - 3^y = 4$, the algorithm will quickly determine that no solutions exist. The modular constraint with $m=4$ is $2^x - (-1)^y \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. If $x=1$, this is $2 - (-1)^y \\not\\equiv 0$. If $x \\ge 2$, this is $0 - (-1)^y \\not\\equiv 0$. Since this holds for no combination of $x,y \\ge 1$, the modular check will rule out every $y$, and the algorithm will correctly return `True`. For the other cases, small solutions will be found, resulting in a `False` output.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the exponential Diophantine equation a^x - b^y = c for small integer solutions\n    using the specified algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # (a, b, c, B_enum, U, K)\n        (2, 3, 5, 50, 1000, 6),\n        (3, 2, 7, 50, 1000, 6),\n        (5, 3, 2, 30, 1000, 6),\n        (7, 2, 3, 40, 1000, 6),\n        (2, 3, -1, 50, 1000, 6),\n        (2, 3, 4, 50, 1000, 6),\n    ]\n\n    MODULI = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13]\n    SAFETY_MARGIN = 2\n\n    def get_residues(base, mod):\n        \"\"\"Computes the set of residues {base^x mod mod} for x >= 1.\"\"\"\n        if mod == 1:\n            return {0}\n        residues = set()\n        val = base % mod\n        while val not in residues:\n            residues.add(val)\n            val = (val * base) % mod\n            if val == 0 and 0 in residues: # Handle cycles that hit 0\n                break\n        return residues\n\n    def check_case(a, b, c, B_enum, U, K):\n        \"\"\"\n        Implements the specified algorithm for a single test case.\n        Returns True if solutions are ruled out, False if a solution is found.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Pre-compute modular residues for a^x for each modulus\n        ax_residues = {m: get_residues(a, m) for m in MODULI}\n\n        # The problem formulation implies c != 0, which is true for all test cases.\n        # If c were 0, log(2*abs(c)) would be undefined.\n        \n        # Calculate bounds on y\n        log_b = np.log(b)\n        \n        # y_1/2: threshold for the validity of the log inequality\n        # This is ceil(log_b(2*|c|))\n        if 2 * abs(c) <= 1:\n            y_one_half = 1\n        else:\n            y_one_half = math.ceil(np.log(2 * abs(c)) / log_b)\n        y_one_half = max(1, y_one_half)\n        \n        # Y_Baker: upper bound on y from Baker's theory\n        # This is floor(log_b(2*|c|*U^K))\n        log_U = np.log(U)\n        y_baker = math.floor((np.log(2 * abs(c)) + K * log_U) / log_b)\n        \n        # y_max: final enumeration bound for y\n        y_max = min(B_enum, max(1, y_baker, y_one_half - 1))\n\n        # Main search loop over y\n        for y in range(1, y_max + 1):\n            # 1.
