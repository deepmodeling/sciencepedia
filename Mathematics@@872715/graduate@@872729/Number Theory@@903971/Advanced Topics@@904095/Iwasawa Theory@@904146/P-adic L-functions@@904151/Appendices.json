No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks us to validate that the Dirac distribution $\\delta_a$ is a $p$-adic measure and then to compute a specific integral with respect to it. We will address these two parts in sequence.\n\nFirst, we prove that $\\delta_a$ is a $\\mathbb{C}_p$-valued measure on $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\nLet $p$ be a fixed prime number. The space under consideration is the ring of $p$-adic integers, $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. A $\\mathbb{C}_p$-valued measure on $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is defined as a bounded, finitely additive set function $\\mu$ from the ring $\\mathcal{R}$ of compact-open subsets of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ to the field $\\mathbb{C}_p$. The ring $\\mathcal{R}$ is generated by sets of the form $c + p^m\\mathbb{Z}_p$ for $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ and $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$. The Dirac distribution at a point $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ is given by the set function $\\delta_a$ defined on any compact-open subset $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_p$ as:\n$$ \\delta_a(U) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } a \\in U \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } a \\notin U \\end{cases} $$\nTo show that $\\delta_a$ is a $\\mathbb{C}_p$-valued measure, we must verify two properties: boundedness and finite additivity.\n\n1.  **Boundedness**: The function $\\delta_a$ maps any set $U \\in \\mathcal{R}$ to either $0$ or $1$. The target space is $\\mathbb{C}_p$ equipped with the $p$-adic norm $|\\cdot|_p$. The values are integers, so their $p$-adic norms are $|0|_p = 0$ and $|1|_p = 1$. Thus, for any $U \\in \\mathcal{R}$, we have $|\\delta_a(U)|_p \\leq 1$. This means the measure is bounded, with a bound of $M=1$.\n\n2.  **Finite Additivity**: Let $\\{U_1, U_2, \\ldots, U_k\\}$ be a finite collection of pairwise disjoint sets in $\\mathcal{R}$. Let their union be $U = \\bigcup_{i=1}^k U_i$, which is also in $\\mathcal{R}$. We must show that $\\delta_a(U) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\delta_a(U_i)$. We analyze two cases based on the position of the point $a$.\n\n    Case (i): $a \\notin U$.\n    If $a$ is not in the union $U$, then by definition, $\\delta_a(U) = 0$. Since $a \\notin \\bigcup_{i=1}^k U_i$, it follows that $a \\notin U_i$ for every $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$. Consequently, $\\delta_a(U_i) = 0$ for all $i$. The sum is $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\delta_a(U_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^k 0 = 0$. The equality $\\delta_a(U) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\delta_a(U_i)$ holds, as $0=0$.\n\n    Case (ii): $a \\in U$.\n    If $a$ is in the union $U$, then by definition, $\\delta_a(U) = 1$. Since the sets $U_i$ are pairwise disjoint, the point $a$ can belong to at most one of them. As $a \\in U$, it must belong to exactly one set, say $U_j$ for a unique index $j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$. For this index $j$, we have $a \\in U_j$, so $\\delta_a(U_j) = 1$. For all other indices $i \\neq j$, we have $a \\notin U_i$, so $\\delta_a(U_i) = 0$. The sum is then $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\delta_a(U_i) = \\delta_a(U_j) + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\delta_a(U_i) = 1 + \\sum_{i \\neq j} 0 = 1$. The equality $\\delta_a(U) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\delta_a(U_i)$ holds, as $1=1$.\n\nSince $\\delta_a$ is both bounded and finitely additive, it is a $\\mathbb{C}_p$-valued measure on $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\n\nNext, we address the second part of the problem. We must show that the binomial polynomial function, $\\binom{\\cdot}{n} \\colon \\mathbb{Z}_p \\to \\mathbb{Q}_p$, is continuous and compute its integral against $\\delta_a$. The binomial polynomial is defined as $\\binom{x}{n} = \\frac{x(x-1)\\cdots(x-n+1)}{n!}$ for $n \\geq 0$.\n\n1.  **Continuity**: Let $P_n(x) = x(x-1)\\cdots(x-n+1)$. This is a polynomial in $x$ with integer coefficients. Any polynomial with integer coefficients is a continuous function from $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. For $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$, the expression $P_n(x) - P_n(y)$ is divisible by $x-y$. So, we can write $P_n(x) - P_n(y) = (x-y)Q(x,y)$, where $Q(x,y)$ is a polynomial in $x$ and $y$ with integer coefficients. As $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$, $Q(x,y)$ evaluates to an element of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, so $|Q(x,y)|_p \\le 1$. From this it follows that $|P_n(x) - P_n(y)|_p \\leq |x-y|_p$. This shows that $P_n$ is a Lipschitz continuous function, which implies it is continuous. The function $\\binom{x}{n}$ is the product of the continuous function $P_n(x)$ and the constant $(n!)^{-1} \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p$. Since multiplication by a constant is a continuous operation, the function $\\binom{\\cdot}{n}$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ with values in $\\mathbb{Q}_p \\subset \\mathbb{C}_p$.\n\n2.  **Integration**: We need to compute $\\int_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\binom{x}{n} \\, d\\delta_a(x)$. The integral of a continuous function $f \\colon \\mathbb{Z}_p \\to \\mathbb{C}_p$ with respect to a measure $\\mu$ is defined by extending the integral from locally constant functions. For the Dirac measure $\\delta_a$, this process yields a simple, fundamental result: for any continuous function $f$, the integral is the value of the function at the point $a$. Let's quickly re-derive this.\n\nLet $f_m$ be a function that is constant on the cosets of $p^m\\mathbb{Z}_p$. We can write $f_m(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{p^m-1} c_j \\mathbf{1}_{j+p^m\\mathbb{Z}_p}(x)$. The integral is defined by linearity from the integral of characteristic functions: $\\int \\mathbf{1}_U d\\mu = \\mu(U)$.\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} f_m(x) \\, d\\delta_a(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{p^m-1} c_j \\delta_a(j+p^m\\mathbb{Z}_p) $$\nThere is a unique $j_0$ such that $a \\in j_0+p^m\\mathbb{Z}_p$, so $\\delta_a(j_0+p^m\\mathbb{Z}_p)=1$ and all other terms are zero. The integral is $c_{j_0}$. But $c_{j_0}$ is the value of $f_m$ on this coset, so $c_{j_0} = f_m(a)$. Thus, for any locally constant function $f_m$, $\\int f_m \\, d\\delta_a = f_m(a)$.\n\nFor a general continuous function $f$, which is a uniform limit of locally constant functions $f_m$, the integral is:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} f(x) \\, d\\delta_a(x) = \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} \\int_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} f_m(x) \\, d\\delta_a(x) = \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} f_m(a) $$\nSince uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence, $\\lim_{m\\to\\infty} f_m(a) = f(a)$. Therefore, for any continuous function $f$:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} f(x) \\, d\\delta_a(x) = f(a) $$\nApplying this general property to the specific function $f(x) = \\binom{x}{n}$, which we have shown to be continuous, we obtain the result:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\binom{x}{n} \\, d\\delta_a(x) = \\binom{a}{n} $$\nThis expression represents the $n$-th moment of the Dirac measure $\\delta_a$.

The term $m! \\binom{x}{m}$ is the falling factorial $x^{\\underline{m}} = x(x-1)\\cdots(x-m+1)$. This identity is a standard result in combinatorial theory.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $j^k$ into the sum, we get:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{p^n-1} j^k = \\sum_{j=0}^{p^n-1} \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{k} S(k,m) \\, m! \\binom{j}{m} \\right)\n$$\nSince the summation over $m$ is finite, we can interchange the order of summation:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{p^n-1} j^k = \\sum_{m=0}^{k} S(k,m) \\, m! \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{p^n-1} \\binom{j}{m} \\right)\n$$\nThe inner sum is a sum of binomial coefficients. We use the fundamental combinatorial identity, often referred to as the hockey-stick identity:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=m}^{N-1} \\binom{j}{m} = \\binom{N}{m+1}\n$$\nFor $j<m$, the term $\\binom{j}{m}$ is zero.

The binomial coefficient is defined as:\n$$\n\\binom{p^n}{m+1} = \\frac{p^n(p^n-1)(p^n-2)\\cdots(p^n-m)}{(m+1)!}\n$$\nTherefore, the term whose limit we seek is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{p^n} \\binom{p^n}{m+1} = \\frac{(p^n-1)(p^n-2)\\cdots(p^n-m)}{(m+1)!}\n$$\nThe limit is evaluated in the $p$-adic topology. In this topology, the sequence $p^n$ converges to $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$, because its $p$-adic absolute value is $|p^n|_p = p^{-n}$, which tends to $0$. Consequently, for any integer $i$, $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (p^n - i) = -i$.
