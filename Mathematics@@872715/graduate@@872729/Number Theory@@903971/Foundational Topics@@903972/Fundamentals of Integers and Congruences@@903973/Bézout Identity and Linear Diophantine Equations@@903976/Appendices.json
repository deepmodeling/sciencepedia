Your final answer must be the minimal nonnegative representative $x$. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The given problem is to determine the minimal non-negative integer $x$ that satisfies the linear congruence $97x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{256}$. The solution process must justify the existence of such an $x$, explicitly compute it using the extended Euclidean algorithm, and verify the uniqueness of the solution class modulo $256$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the given congruence and a linear Diophantine equation. The congruence $97x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{256}$ is equivalent, by definition, to the statement that $256$ divides the quantity $97x - 1$. This implies that there exists an integer, let's call it $y'$, such that $97x - 1 = 256y'$. Rearranging this equation gives $97x - 256y' = 1$. By letting $y = -y'$, we can express this in the standard form of a linear Diophantine equation:\n$$97x + 256y = 1$$\nSolving the congruence is therefore equivalent to finding an integer solution $(x, y)$ to this equation.\n\nThe existence of integer solutions to an equation of the form $ax + by = c$ is governed by Bézout's identity. The identity states that such an equation has integer solutions for $x$ and $y$ if and only if the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$, denoted $\\gcd(a, b)$, is a divisor of $c$. In our case, $a=97$, $b=256$, and $c=1$. Thus, a solution exists if and only if $\\gcd(97, 256)$ divides $1$. Since $\\gcd(97, 256)$ must be a positive integer, this condition is equivalent to $\\gcd(97, 256) = 1$.\n\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of $97$ and $256$.\n$$256 = 2 \\cdot 97 + 62$$\n$$97 = 1 \\cdot 62 + 35$$\n$$62 = 1 \\cdot 35 + 27$$\n$$35 = 1 \\cdot 27 + 8$$\n$$27 = 3 \\cdot 8 + 3$$\n$$8 = 2 \\cdot 3 + 2$$\n$$3 = 1 \\cdot 2 + 1$$\n$$2 = 2 \\cdot 1 + 0$$\nThe last non-zero remainder in the sequence is $1$. Therefore, we have conclusively shown that $\\gcd(97, 256) = 1$. According to Bézout's identity, this guarantees the existence of integers $x$ and $y$ satisfying $97x + 256y = 1$. Taking this equation modulo $256$ yields $97x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{256}$, which confirms the existence of the modular inverse $x$.\n\nNext, we employ the constructive extended Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution for $x$. This is achieved by working backward through the steps of the Euclidean algorithm to express the gcd, $1$, as a linear combination of $97$ and $256$.\n\nFrom the second to last step of the algorithm, we have $1 = 3 - 1 \\cdot 2$.\nWe substitute the remainder from the previous step, $2 = 8 - 2 \\cdot 3$, into this expression:\n$$1 = 3 - 1 \\cdot (8 - 2 \\cdot 3) = 3 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 3 = 3 \\cdot 3 - 1 \\cdot 8$$\nNext, we substitute $3 = 27 - 3 \\cdot 8$:\n$$1 = 3 \\cdot (27 - 3 \\cdot 8) - 1 \\cdot 8 = 3 \\cdot 27 - 9 \\cdot 8 - 1 \\cdot 8 = 3 \\cdot 27 - 10 \\cdot 8$$\nNext, we substitute $8 = 35 - 1 \\cdot 27$:\n$$1 = 3 \\cdot 27 - 10 \\cdot (35 - 1 \\cdot 27) = 3 \\cdot 27 - 10 \\cdot 35 + 10 \\cdot 27 = 13 \\cdot 27 - 10 \\cdot 35$$\nNext, we substitute $27 = 62 - 1 \\cdot 35$:\n$$1 = 13 \\cdot (62 - 1 \\cdot 35) - 10 \\cdot 35 = 13 \\cdot 62 - 13 \\cdot 35 - 10 \\cdot 35 = 13 \\cdot 62 - 23 \\cdot 35$$\nNext, we substitute $35 = 97 - 1 \\cdot 62$:\n$$1 = 13 \\cdot 62 - 23 \\cdot (97 - 1 \\cdot 62) = 13 \\cdot 62 - 23 \\cdot 97 + 23 \\cdot 62 = 36 \\cdot 62 - 23 \\cdot 97$$\nFinally, we substitute $62 = 256 - 2 \\cdot 97$:\n$$1 = 36 \\cdot (256 - 2 \\cdot 97) - 23 \\cdot 97 = 36 \\cdot 256 - 72 \\cdot 97 - 23 \\cdot 97$$\nThis simplifies to the desired form:\n$$1 = 36 \\cdot 256 - 95 \\cdot 97$$\nRearranging to match the form $97x + 256y = 1$, we have:\n$$97(-95) + 256(36) = 1$$\nFrom this equation, we identify a particular solution for $x$ as $x_0 = -95$. This value satisfies the congruence $97 \\cdot (-95) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{256}$. The problem requires the minimal non-negative integer $x$. We find this by computing the value of $x_0$ modulo $256$:\n$$x \\equiv -95 \\pmod{256}$$\n$$x \\equiv -95 + 256 \\pmod{256}$$\n$$x \\equiv 161 \\pmod{256}$$\nThus, the minimal non-negative integer solution is $x = 161$.\n\nFinally, we must provide a first-principles argument for the uniqueness of the solution class modulo $256$. Let us assume that both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are integer solutions to the congruence.\n$$97x_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{256}$$\n$$97x_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{256}$$\nBy the property of reflexivity, $1 \\equiv 97x_2 \\pmod{256}$. By transitivity, we have $97x_1 \\equiv 97x_2 \\pmod{256}$.\nSubtracting $97x_2$ from both sides gives:\n$$97x_1 - 97x_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{256}$$\n$$97(x_1 - x_2) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{256}$$\nBy the definition of modular congruence, this implies that $256$ divides the product $97(x_1 - x_2)$, which we write as $256 | 97(x_1 - x_2)$.\nWe have already established that $\\gcd(97, 256) = 1$. A fundamental lemma in number theory (a corollary of Bézout's identity, often called Euclid's lemma) states that if an integer $n$ divides a product $ab$ and is coprime to $a$ (i.e., $\\gcd(n, a) = 1$), then $n$ must divide $b$. In our context, $n=256$, $a=97$, and $b=(x_1 - x_2)$.\nSince $256 | 97(x_1 - x_2)$ and $\\gcd(256, 97) = 1$, we must conclude that $256 | (x_1 - x_2)$.\nThis divisibility condition is, by definition, equivalent to the statement $x_1 \\equiv x_2 \\pmod{256}$.\nThis proves that any two solutions to the original congruence must be congruent to each other modulo $256$. Hence, while there are infinitely many integer solutions, they all belong to a single, unique congruence class modulo $256$. The minimal non-negative representative of this class is the unique solution in the ring of integers modulo $256$, which is the value $x=161$ we found.\nWe can verify this result: $97 \\times 161 = 15617$. Dividing by $256$, we find $15617 = 61 \\times 256 + 1$, confirming that $97 \\times 161 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{256}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{161}$$", "id": "3009032"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond equations of the form $ax+by=1$, we now explore the general linear Diophantine equation $ax+by=c$.

In this case, $a=5$, $b=7$, and $c=100$. The greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(5, 7)=1$. Since $1$ divides any integer, it certainly divides $100$. Thus, integer solutions exist.\n\nThe next step is to find a particular solution $(x_0, y_0)$ to the equation. We begin by finding a particular solution $(u_0, v_0)$ to the associated Bézout's identity, $5u + 7v = 1$. This can be done using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or by inspection. By inspection, we can see that\n$$5(3) + 7(-2) = 15 - 14 = 1$$\nSo, a particular solution to $5u+7v=1$ is $(u_0, v_0) = (3, -2)$.\n\nTo find a particular solution to the original equation, $5x+7y=100$, we can multiply the identity $5(3) + 7(-2) = 1$ by $100$:\n$$100 \\times (5(3) + 7(-2)) = 100 \\times 1$$\n$$5(3 \\times 100) + 7(-2 \\times 100) = 100$$\n$$5(300) + 7(-200) = 100$$\nThis gives us a particular solution $(x_0, y_0) = (300, -200)$.\n\nThe problem statement requires us to characterize the entire lattice of integer solutions.
