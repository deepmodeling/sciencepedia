Over a field, Lagrange’s theorem asserts that a nonzero polynomial of degree $d$ has at most $d$ roots. In contrast, over rings with zero divisors this can fail.\n\nWork in the specific ring $\\mathbb{Z}/420\\mathbb{Z}$ and analyze the congruence $x^{2}\\equiv x \\pmod{420}$ using only foundational tools: the definitions of roots of a polynomial in a commutative ring, the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), basic divisibility in the integers, and the fact that $\\gcd(x,x-1)=1$ for every integer $x$.

Provide this count as your final answer. This computation will exhibit a concrete counterexample to the field version of Lagrange’s bound for the number of roots.\n\nYour final answer must be a single integer. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed question in elementary number theory, grounded in the established principles of modular arithmetic and the structure of rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. It is self-contained, objective, and its resolution requires a direct application of standard, non-trivial mathematical reasoning.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the number of solutions to the polynomial congruence $x^2 \\equiv x \\pmod{420}$. This is equivalent to finding the number of roots of the polynomial $f(x) = x^2 - x$ in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/420\\mathbb{Z}$. Such roots are known as idempotent elements of the ring.\n\nThe core strategy is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). First, we find the prime factorization of the modulus $n=420$.\n$$420 = 42 \\times 10 = (6 \\times 7) \\times (2 \\times 5) = (2 \\times 3 \\times 7) \\times (2 \\times 5) = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1$$\nThe congruence $x^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{420}$ holds if and only if the following system of congruences is satisfied simultaneously:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} \\\\\nx^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nx^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\\\\nx^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe will now determine the number of solutions for each of these congruences. Let $N_{p^k}$ be the number of solutions to $x^2-x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^k}$.\n\nCase 1: Modulo $p$ for primes $p \\in \\{3, 5, 7\\}$.\nThe congruence is $x^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, which can be written as $x(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $p$ is a prime number, the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ is a field. A field is an integral domain, meaning it has no zero divisors. Therefore, for the product $x(x-1)$ to be congruent to $0$, at least one of the factors must be congruent to $0$.\nThis leads to two possibilities:\n- $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$\n- $x - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, which implies $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$\nThese two solutions are distinct for any prime $p$.\nThus, for $p=3$, we have $2$ solutions: $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. So, $N_3 = 2$.\nFor $p=5$, we have $2$ solutions: $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. So, $N_5 = 2$.\nFor $p=7$, we have $2$ solutions: $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$ and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. So, $N_7 = 2$.\n\nCase 2: Modulo $4$.\nThe congruence is $x^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, which is $x(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe ring $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ is not a field and contains a zero divisor ($2$, since $2 \\cdot 2 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$). Therefore, we cannot simply conclude that one of the factors must be zero.\nHowever, we can use the provided hint that for any integer $x$, the numbers $x$ and $x-1$ are consecutive integers. Consequently, their greatest common divisor is $1$, i.e., $\\gcd(x, x-1) = 1$.\nThis means that $x$ and $x-1$ share no common prime factors. The prime factorization of $4$ is $2^2$. For the product $x(x-1)$ to be divisible by $4$, the factor of $4$ cannot be split between $x$ and $x-1$. Thus, one of the factors must be divisible by $4$ entirely.\nThis gives two mutually exclusive possibilities:\n- $4$ divides $x$, which means $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n- $4$ divides $x-1$, which means $x-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, or $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nWe can verify these are indeed solutions:\n- If $x=0$, then $0^2 - 0 = 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n- If $x=1$, then $1^2 - 1 = 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\nOther residues modulo $4$ are not solutions:\n- If $x=2$, then $2^2 - 2 = 2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n- If $x=3$, then $3^2 - 3 = 6 \\equiv 2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\nSo, there are exactly $2$ solutions modulo $4$. Thus, $N_4 = 2$.\n\nFinal Step: Combining solutions using the CRT.\nWe have found the number of solutions for each prime power modulus:\n- $N_4 = 2$ solutions for $x \\pmod{4}$.\n- $N_3 = 2$ solutions for $x \\pmod{3}$.\n- $N_5 = 2$ solutions for $x \\pmod{5}$.\n- $N_7 = 2$ solutions for $x \\pmod{7}$.\nFor any combination of choices of one solution from each of these individual congruences, the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees the existence of a unique solution modulo $420$. The total number of solutions is therefore the product of the number of solutions for each individual modulus.\nTotal number of solutions $= N_4 \\times N_3 \\times N_5 \\times N_7 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe polynomial $f(x)=x^2-x$ has degree $2$, but it possesses $16$ distinct roots in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/420\\mathbb{Z}$, concretely demonstrating that Lagrange's theorem on the number of roots of a polynomial does not hold for general commutative rings.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{16}\n$$", "id": "3021109"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of the field structure, we now turn to a powerful computational technique for root-finding in finite fields.

Our task is to find the monic greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x^{31}-x$, and then use it to determine all distinct roots of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the polynomial $x^{31}-x$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any element $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{31}$, we have $a^{31} \\equiv a \\pmod{31}$, which is equivalent to $a^{31} - a = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$.

Since the degree of $x^{31}-x$ is $31$, and there are $31$ elements in the field $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$, the roots of $x^{31}-x$ are precisely all the elements of $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$.

Since the roots of $x^{31}-x$ comprise the entire field $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$, the roots of $\\gcd(f(x), x^{31}-x)$ are precisely the roots of $f(x)$ that lie in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$.\n\nLet's denote $g(x) = \\gcd(f(x), x^{31}-x)$. We are asked to first determine the monic form of $g(x)$. Let's decompose $f(x)$ into its factors in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}[x]$:\nLet $f_1(x) = x^{4} - 10 x^{2} + 9$ and $f_2(x) = x^{2} + 1$.\nThen $f(x) = f_1(x)^2 f_2(x)$.\nUsing the property $\\gcd(ab, c) = \\gcd(a, c) \\gcd(b, c)$ when $\\gcd(a, b)=1$, we analyze the factors separately. The gcd of $f(x)$ and $x^{31}-x$ depends on the gcd of its factors with $x^{31}-x$.\n$$\ng(x) = \\gcd(f_1(x)^2 f_2(x), x^{31}-x)\n$$\nLet's first find $\\gcd(f_2(x), x^{31}-x) = \\gcd(x^2+1, x^{31}-x)$. A non-trivial gcd would imply a common root. A root of $x^2+1=0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$ must satisfy $x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{31}$. We determine if $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $31$ using the Legendre symbol:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}\n$$\nFor $p=31$, we have:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{-1}{31}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{31-1}{2}} = (-1)^{15} = -1\n$$\nSince the value is $-1$, $-1$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $31$. Therefore, the polynomial $f_2(x) = x^2+1$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$. As all irreducible factors of $x^{31}-x$ are linear, $f_2(x)$ can share no factors with $x^{31}-x$. Thus, $\\gcd(f_2(x), x^{31}-x) = 1$.\n\nThis simplifies the overall gcd calculation:\n$$\ng(x) = \\gcd(f_1(x)^2, x^{31}-x)\n$$\nNow we analyze $f_1(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 9$. We can factor it as:\n$$\nf_1(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 9)\n$$\nThe roots of $f_1(x)$ are the solutions to $x^2=1$ and $x^2=9$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$.\nFor $x^2=1$, the roots are $x=1$ and $x=-1 \\equiv 30 \\pmod{31}$.\nFor $x^2=9$, the roots are $x=3$ and $x=-3 \\equiv 28 \\pmod{31}$.\nAll four roots, $\\{1, 3, 28, 30\\}$, are distinct and are elements of $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$.\nSince $f_1(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $4$ and we have found $4$ distinct roots in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$, it must be that $f_1(x)$ is a product of distinct linear factors over $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$:\n$$\nf_1(x) = (x-1)(x-30)(x-3)(x-28)\n$$\nSince all roots of $f_1(x)$ are in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$, each linear factor $(x-r)$ of $f_1(x)$ is also a factor of $x^{31}-x$. Because $f_1(x)$ has no repeated roots, $f_1(x)$ itself must divide $x^{31}-x$.\nLet $x^{31}-x = f_1(x) \\cdot q(x)$ for some polynomial $q(x) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{31}[x]$. The roots of $q(x)$ are the elements of $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$ that are not roots of $f_1(x)$. Therefore, $\\gcd(f_1(x), q(x)) = 1$.\n\nWe can now determine $g(x)$:\n$$\ng(x) = \\gcd(f_1(x)^2, x^{31}-x) = \\gcd(f_1(x)^2, f_1(x)q(x))\n$$\nUsing the property $\\gcd(a^2, ab) = a \\cdot \\gcd(a, b)$, we get:\n$$\ng(x) = f_1(x) \\cdot \\gcd(f_1(x), q(x)) = f_1(x) \\cdot 1 = f_1(x)\n$$\nSo the monic greatest common divisor is $g(x) = f_1(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 9$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to use this gcd to find all distinct roots of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$. As established, the roots of the gcd are precisely these roots. We must find the roots of $g(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 9 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$.\n$$\n(x^2-1)(x^2-9) = 0\n$$\nThis leads to two separate equations:\n$1$. $x^2 - 1 = 0$, which gives $x^2 = 1$.

We need the multiplicative inverse of $2$ modulo $19$, which is $10$ since $2 \\times 10 = 20 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$.\n    $$ x_1 = 10 \\times (3+2) = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{19} $$\n    $$ x_2 = 10 \\times (3-2) = 10 \\times 1 = 10 \\pmod{19} $$\n    The three distinct roots are $10$, $12$, and $16$. The polynomial is separable, as expected, and splits completely. The factorization is $f(x) \\equiv (x-10)(x-12)(x-16) \\pmod{19}$. The number of distinct solutions is $3$.\n\n**Case 3: $p = 3$**\n1.  **Prediction**: We reduce the discriminant modulo $3$:\n    $$ \\bar{\\Delta} \\equiv 81 \\pmod{3} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $$\n    Since the discriminant is zero, the polynomial $\\bar{f}(x)$ must have a multiple root. This implies it is not separable and the number of distinct roots is less than the degree, i.e., at most $2$.\n\n2.  **Justification**: We reduce the polynomial $f(x)$ modulo $3$:\n    $$ f(x) = x^3 - 3x - 1 \\equiv x^3 - 0x - 1 \\equiv x^3 - 1 \\pmod{3} $$\n    Using the property $(a-b)^p \\equiv a^p - b^p \\pmod p$ for a prime $p$ (Freshman's Dream):\n    $$ f(x) \\equiv x^3 - 1^3 \\equiv (x-1)^3 \\pmod{3} $$\n    The factorization is $(x-1)^3$. This shows that $x=1$ is a root with multiplicity $3$.\n    Therefore, there is only one distinct solution, $x=1$. The polynomial is inseparable, as predicted. Its formal derivative is $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, which confirms that every root is a multiple root. The number of distinct solutions is $1$.\n\n**Summary of Results**\n- For $p=7$, the number of distinct roots is $0$.\n- For $p=19$, the number of distinct roots is $3$.\n- For $p=3$, the number of distinct roots is $1$.\n\nThe required ordered triple is $(0, 3, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  3  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3021118"}]}
