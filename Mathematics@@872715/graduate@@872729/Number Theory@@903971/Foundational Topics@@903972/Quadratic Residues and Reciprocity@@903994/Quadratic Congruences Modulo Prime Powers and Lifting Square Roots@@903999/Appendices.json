The solution process involves finding the square roots of the discriminant $\\Delta = b^2 - 4c$ modulo $p^k$ and then using them to determine the values of $x$.\n\nThe given congruence is $x^2 - 34x + 17 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19^4}$. Since the modulus $19^4$ is a power of an odd prime $p=19$, we can complete the square. Multiplying the congruence by $4$, which is invertible modulo $19^4$, we get:\n$$4x^2 - 4bx + 4c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^k}$$\n$$(2x - b)^2 - b^2 + 4c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^k}$$\n$$(2x - b)^2 \\equiv b^2 - 4c \\pmod{p^k}$$\nLet $\\Delta = b^2 - 4c$ be the discriminant. The congruence becomes $(2x - b)^2 \\equiv \\Delta \\pmod{p^k}$. To solve for $x$, we must first find the square roots of $\\Delta$ modulo $p^k$. Let $y$ be such a square root, i.e., $y^2 \\equiv \\Delta \\pmod{p^k}$. Then we have:\n$$2x - b \\equiv \\pm y \\pmod{p^k}$$\n$$2x \\equiv b \\pm y \\pmod{p^k}$$\nSince $p=19$ is odd, $2$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $p^k$. Thus, the two solutions for $x$ are given by:\n$$x \\equiv 2^{-1}(b \\pm y) \\pmod{p^k}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the discriminant $\\Delta$ with the given values $b=34$ and $c=17$:\n$$\\Delta = 34^2 - 4(17) = 1156 - 68 = 1088$$\nSo we need to solve $y^2 \\equiv 1088 \\pmod{19^4}$. The procedure is to first find a square root modulo $p=19$, and then lift this root sequentially to moduli $19^2$, $19^3$, and $19^4$ using Hensel's Lemma.\n\nStep 1: Find square roots of $\\Delta$ modulo $p=19$.\nWe need to solve $y_1^2 \\equiv 1088 \\pmod{19}$.\n$1088 = 57 \\times 19 + 5$, so $1088 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{19}$.\nWe need to find $y_1$ such that $y_1^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{19}$. We can test values: $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, ..., $9^2 = 81 = 4 \\times 19 + 5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{19}$.\nSo, one square root is $y_1 = 9$. The other is $-y_1 \\equiv -9 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{19}$. We choose $y_1 = 9$ to begin the lifting process.\n\nStep 2: Lift the root from modulo $19$ to modulo $19^2$.\nLet $f(y) = y^2 - \\Delta$. We have a root $y_1 = 9$ of $f(y) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$. We seek a root $y_2$ modulo $19^2$ of the form $y_2 = y_1 + 19t_1$.\nAccording to Hensel's Lemma, the correction term $t_1$ is found by solving the linear congruence:\n$$f(y_1) + f'(y_1) (19 t_1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19^2}$$\n$$(y_1^2 - \\Delta) + (2y_1)(19t_1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19^2}$$\nDividing by $19$ (since $y_1^2 - \\Delta$ is a multiple of $19$):\n$$\\frac{y_1^2 - \\Delta}{19} + 2y_1 t_1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$$\n$$t_1 \\equiv -\\frac{y_1^2 - \\Delta}{19} (2y_1)^{-1} \\pmod{19}$$\nWe calculate the components:\n$y_1^2 - \\Delta = 9^2 - 1088 = 81 - 1088 = -1007$.\n$\\frac{y_1^2 - \\Delta}{19} = \\frac{-1007}{19} = -53$.\n$-53 \\equiv -53 + 3 \\times 19 = -53 + 57 = 4 \\pmod{19}$.\n$f'(y_1) = 2y_1 = 2(9) = 18 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{19}$. The inverse is $(f'(y_1))^{-1} \\equiv (-1)^{-1} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{19}$.\nSo, $t_1 \\equiv - (4) \\cdot (-1) \\equiv 4 \\pmod{19}$.\nThe lifted root is $y_2 = y_1 + 19t_1 = 9 + 19(4) = 9 + 76 = 85$.\nCheck: $y_2^2 = 85^2 = 7225$. $y_2^2 - \\Delta = 7225 - 1088 = 6137$. And $6137 = 17 \\times 361 = 17 \\times 19^2$. So $y_2^2 \\equiv 1088 \\pmod{19^2}$.\n\nStep 3: Lift the root from modulo $19^2$ to modulo $19^3$.\nWe seek a root $y_3$ modulo $19^3$ of the form $y_3 = y_2 + 19^2 t_2$. The correction $t_2$ is given by:\n$$t_2 \\equiv -\\frac{y_2^2 - \\Delta}{19^2} (2y_2)^{-1} \\pmod{19}$$\nWe have $y_2^2 - \\Delta = 6137$.\n$\\frac{y_2^2 - \\Delta}{19^2} = \\frac{6137}{361} = 17$.\n$2y_2 = 2(85) = 170$.

The correction $t_3$ is:\n$$t_3 \\equiv -\\frac{y_3^2 - \\Delta}{19^3} (2y_3)^{-1} \\pmod{19}$$\n$y_3^2 = 6222^2 = 38713284$.\n$y_3^2 - \\Delta = 38713284 - 1088 = 38712196$.\n$\\frac{y_3^2 - \\Delta}{19^3} = \\frac{38712196}{6859} = 5644$.\nModulo $19$, $5644 = 297 \\times 19 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$.\n$2y_3 = 2(6222) = 12444$. Modulo $19$, $6222 = 327 \\times 19 + 9 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{19}$. So $2y_3 \\equiv 2(9) = 18 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{19}$.\nThus $(2y_3)^{-1} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{19}$.\n$t_3 \\equiv - (1) \\cdot (-1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$.\nThe final lifted root is $y = y_4 = y_3 + 19^3 t_3 = 6222 + 6859(1) = 13081$.\nSo, one square root of $\\Delta = 1088$ modulo $19^4 = 130321$ is $y = 13081$. The other is $-y \\equiv -13081 \\equiv 130321 - 13081 = 117240 \\pmod{130321}$.\n\nStep 5: Compute the solutions for $x$.\nThe solutions are found by solving $2x \\equiv b \\pm y \\pmod{19^4}$. We have $b = 34$ and $y = 13081$, and the modulus is $m=19^4 = 130321$.\n\nSolution 1: $2x_1 \\equiv b + y = 34 + 13081 = 13115 \\pmod{130321}$.\nSince $13115$ is odd and the modulus $130321$ is odd, we can write $2x_1 \\equiv 13115 + 130321 \\pmod{130321}$, which makes the right-hand side even.\n$2x_1 \\equiv 143436 \\pmod{130321}$.\n$x_1 \\equiv \\frac{143436}{2} = 71718 \\pmod{130321}$.\n\nSolution 2: $2x_2 \\equiv b - y = 34 - 13081 = -13047 \\pmod{130321}$.\nWe can write $2x_2 \\equiv -13047 + 130321 \\pmod{130321}$ to make the right-hand side positive and even.\n$2x_2 \\equiv 117274 \\pmod{130321}$.\n$x_2 \\equiv \\frac{117274}{2} = 58637 \\pmod{130321}$.\n\nThe two solutions for $x$ in the interval $[0, 19^4-1]$ are $71718$ and $58637$.\n\nStep 6: Final Answer.\nThe problem asks for the least nonnegative solution. Comparing the two solutions, $58637 < 71718$.\nTherefore, the least nonnegative solution is $58637$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{58637}\n$$", "id": "3021640"}, {"introduction": "Before finding solutions, it is crucial to understand how many to expect.

The analysis will proceed by first decomposing the problem using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and then analyzing the number of solutions modulo prime powers, paying special attention to the difference between odd primes and the prime $p=2$.\n\nLet the prime factorization of $n$ be $n = 2^{k} \\prod_{i=1}^{r} p_{i}^{e_{i}}$, where each $p_{i}$ is a distinct odd prime, $e_{i} \\geq 1$, and $k \\ge 0$. The congruence $x^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$ is equivalent, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, to the system of congruences:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^k} \\\\\nx^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_1^{e_1}} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_r^{e_r}}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nIf we denote the number of solutions to $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$ as $N(m)$, the total number of solutions modulo $n$ is the product of the number of solutions for each prime power component:\n$$N(n) = N(2^k) \\cdot N(p_1^{e_1}) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot N(p_r^{e_r}) = N(2^k) \\prod_{i=1}^{r} N(p_i^{e_i})$$\n\nFirst, we analyze the case for an odd prime power, $p^e$.\nThe congruence is $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^e}$, which is equivalent to $p^e | (x^2 - 1)$, or $p^e | (x-1)(x+1)$.\nThe greatest common divisor of $(x-1)$ and $(x+1)$ is $\\gcd(x-1, (x+1)-(x-1)) = \\gcd(x-1, 2)$. Since $p$ is an odd prime, $p$ does not divide $2$. Therefore, $p$ cannot divide both $(x-1)$ and $(x+1)$ simultaneously. This implies that the full power of $p$, which is $p^e$, must divide either $(x-1)$ or $(x+1)$.\nThis leads to two possibilities:\n$1.$ $x-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^e} \\implies x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^e}$.\n$2.$ $x+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^e} \\implies x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p^e}$.\nThese two solutions, $1$ and $-1$, are distinct modulo $p^e$ because $p^e | (1 - (-1))$ would mean $p^e | 2$, which is impossible for an odd prime $p$ and $e \\ge 1$.\nThus, for any odd prime $p$ and integer $e \\ge 1$, there are exactly $2$ solutions to $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^e}$. This can also be confirmed using Hensel's Lemma. Let $f(x) = x^2 - 1$. The base case is $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, which has solutions $x_0 = 1$ and $x_0 = -1$. The derivative is $f'(x) = 2x$. For both solutions, $f'(x_0) = \\pm 2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$ since $p$ is odd. Hensel's Lemma guarantees that each of these solutions lifts uniquely to a solution modulo $p^e$ for any $e \\ge 1$. This confirms $N(p_i^{e_i}) = 2$ for all $i=1, \\dots, r$.\n\nNext, we analyze the case for powers of $2$, which is fundamentally different.\nThe congruence is $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^k}$.\nCase $k=1$: $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. The only solution is $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. So, $N(2) = 1$.\nCase $k=2$: $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. By testing residues $1^2 \\equiv 1$ and $3^2=9 \\equiv 1$, we find two solutions: $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. So, $N(4) = 2$.\nCase $k \\ge 3$: $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^k}$. A solution $x$ must be odd, so $\\gcd(x, 2^k)=1$. We are looking for elements of order $1$ or $2$ in the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/2^k \\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. For $k \\ge 3$, this group is not cyclic; it has the structure $(\\mathbb{Z}/2^k \\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2 \\times C_{2^{k-2}}$, where $C_m$ is the cyclic group of order $m$. An element has order dividing $2$ if and only if its components in the direct product have order dividing $2$.\nIn $C_2$, both elements (the identity and the generator) have order dividing $2$.\nIn $C_{2^{k-2}}$, there are exactly two elements whose order divides $2$: the identity and the unique element of order $2$ (which is $2^{k-3}$ in the additive group, corresponding to $1+2^{k-1}$ multiplicatively).\nTherefore, there are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ such elements in the direct product group. These correspond to four distinct solutions modulo $2^k$:\n$1.$ $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^k}$\n$2.$ $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2^k}$\n$3.$ $x \\equiv 1+2^{k-1} \\pmod{2^k}$\n$4.$ $x \\equiv -1+2^{k-1} \\pmod{2^k}$ (which is also $2^{k-1}-1 \\pmod{2^k}$)\nThese four solutions are distinct for $k \\ge 3$. Thus, $N(2^k) = 4$ for $k \\ge 3$.\n\nThe structural difference arises from the properties of the group of units. For an odd prime $p$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^e \\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic, and a cyclic group has exactly two square roots of unity. For $p=2$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2^k \\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is not cyclic for $k \\ge 3$, which allows for more square roots of unity.\n\nCombining these results, the total number of solutions for $n = 2^{k} \\prod_{i=1}^{r} p_{i}^{e_{i}}$ is:\n$N(n) = N(2^k) \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{r} N(p_i^{e_i}) = N(2^k) \\cdot 2^r$.\nThe value depends on $k$:\n- If $k=0$ or $k=1$ (i.e., $n$ is odd or twice an odd number), $N(n) = 1 \\cdot 2^r = 2^r$.\n- If $k=2$ (i.e., $n=4m$ with $m$ odd), $N(n) = 2 \\cdot 2^r = 2^{r+1}$.\n- If $k \\ge 3$ (i.e., $8 \\mid n$), $N(n) = 4 \\cdot 2^r = 2^{r+2}$.\nThe presence of the prime $p=2$ with a high enough power ($k \\ge 2$) increases the number of solutions beyond the baseline of $2^r$ for an odd number.\n\nFor the specific example $n = 2^{7} \\cdot 3^{3} \\cdot 5^{2}$:\nThe modulus $n$ is composed of three prime power factors: $2^7$, $3^3$, and $5^2$. We find the number of solutions for each component.\n$1.$ For $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^7}$: Here, the power of $2$ is $k=7$.

Thus, there are $N(5^2) = 2$ solutions.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the total number of distinct solutions modulo $n$ is the product of the number of solutions for each prime power factor:\nTotal number of solutions $= N(2^7) \\cdot N(3^3) \\cdot N(5^2) = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 16$.\nThis matches the formula derived above.

As with modulus $5$, the solutions are $x \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{3}$.\nFor an odd prime $p$, solutions to $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^k}$ can be found by lifting the solutions from modulo $p$.

In the residue system $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, the representative for $-x$ is $n-x$ (for $x \\neq 0$).\nSince $1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod n$, $x=0$ is not a solution. Thus, for every solution $x$, $n-x$ is also a potential solution.\nThe solutions can be grouped into pairs $\\{x, n-x\\}$, provided that $x \\neq n-x$. If $x = n-x$, then $2x=n$, which implies $x = n/2$. We must check if $x=n/2$ is a solution to the congruence.\nHere, $n=2160$, so $n/2 = 1080$. We check if $x=1080$ satisfies $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2160}$.\n$1080^2 = (1080)(1080) = \\frac{2160}{2} \\cdot 1080 = 2160 \\cdot 540$\nSo, $1080^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2160}$.\nSince $0 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2160}$, $x=1080$ is not a solution.\nThis confirms that for every solution $x \\in X$, $n-x$ is also a solution and $x \\neq n-x$. Therefore, the $16$ solutions can be partitioned into $16/2 = 8$ distinct pairs of the form $\\{x_i, n-x_i\\}$.\n\nThe sum of the elements in each such pair is $x_i + (n-x_i) = n$.\nThe total sum $S$ is the sum of these $8$ pairs:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} (x_i + (n-x_i)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} n = 8n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of $S$:\n$$n = 2160$$\n$$S = 8 \\times 2160 = 17280$$\n\nThe sum of all distinct solutions is $17280$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{17280}$$", "id": "3021642"}]}
