This exercise provides a crucial counterexample that highlights the true nature of the Jacobi symbol, showing how it can equal $1$ even when the corresponding congruence has no solution.

The prime factorization of $n$ is $15 = 3 \\times 5$.\n\nBy definition, for an odd composite integer $n = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, the Jacobi symbol $\\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right)$ is defined as the product of the Legendre symbols for each prime factor:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a}{p_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{a}{p_2}\\right) \\cdots \\left(\\frac{a}{p_k}\\right)\n$$\nFor $n=15$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{a}{15}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a}{3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{a}{5}\\right)\n$$\nWe are given the condition $\\left(\\frac{a}{15}\\right) = 1$.

This law can be extended via the Jacobi symbol to hold for any pair of odd integers $p, q > 1$.\n\n### $1.$ Algorithm Specification\n\nThe algorithm computes $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)$ by iteratively reducing the pair $(a, p)$ to a simpler pair while keeping track of a sign multiplier. Let the state of the computation be represented by the triplet $(k, n, d)$, where we seek to compute the value $k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)$. Initially, this state is $(1, a, p)$. The algorithm terminates when $n$ becomes $0$ or $1$.\n\n**Initialization:**\n$1.$ Set the initial accumulated sign $k = 1$.\n$2.$ The initial numerator is the input integer $a$. The initial denominator is the odd prime $p$.\n$3.$ Apply the property $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a \\pmod p}{p}\\right)$. Replace $a$ with $a \\pmod p$. After this step, we have $0 \\le a  p$.\n\n**Iteration:**\nThe core of the algorithm is a loop that continues as long as $a \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step $1$: Base Cases.**\n- If $a = 0$, the Legendre symbol is $0$. The algorithm terminates and returns $0$.\n- If $a = 1$, the symbol is $1$. The value is determined by the accumulated sign $k$. The algorithm terminates and returns $k$.\n\n**Step $2$: Factoring out powers of $2$.**\nThe numerator $a$ is factored into $a = 2^s \\cdot m$, where $m$ is odd. Using multiplicativity, we have $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2^s m}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{p}\\right)^s \\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right)$.\n- Find the number of factors of $2$ in $a$. Let this be $s$.\n- If $s$ is odd, the accumulated sign $k$ must be multiplied by $\\left(\\frac{2}{p}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{p^2-1}{8}}$. This is equivalent to flipping the sign of $k$ if $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$ or $p \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$.\n- After accounting for the sign change, replace $a$ with its odd part, $m$.\n- After this step, $a$ is odd. We must re-check the base case $a=1$, as the original $a$ could have been a power of $2$. If $a=1$, terminate and return the current sign $k$.\n\n**Step $3$: Applying Quadratic Reciprocity.**\nAt this point, $a$ is an odd integer such that $1  a  p$.\n- We have $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{a}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{a-1}{2}\\frac{p-1}{2}}$.\n- The sign $k$ is updated by multiplying it by the reciprocity factor $(-1)^{\\frac{a-1}{2}\\frac{p-1}{2}}$. This is equivalent to flipping the sign of $k$ if and only if both $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ and $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\n- The problem of computing $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)$ is swapped for computing $\\left(\\frac{p}{a}\\right)$. The roles of numerator and denominator are interchanged.\n- The new pair becomes $(p, a)$. To continue the iteration in a manner that ensures termination, we reduce the new numerator modulo the new denominator. The new state for the next iteration is defined by the pair $(p \\pmod a, a)$. So we set the new $a$ to be $p \\pmod a$ and the new $p$ to be the old $a$. The loop then continues from Step $1$.\n\n### $2.$ Proof of Termination\n\nThe algorithm's termination is guaranteed by the fact that one of the integer arguments strictly decreases at each reciprocity step.\n\nLet the pair of integers being processed at the start of an iteration of the main loop be $(a_i, p_i)$.\n$1.$ The initial step reduces the input $a_{in}$ to $a_0 = a_{in} \\pmod p$, so $0 \\le a_0  p$. The initial denominator is $p_0=p$.\n$2.$ Inside the loop, $a_i$ is first processed to extract factors of $2$, resulting in an odd integer $a'_i \\le a_i$. The denominator $p_i$ is unchanged.\n$3.$ The reciprocity step transforms the pair $(a'_i, p_i)$ into a new pair for the next iteration, $(a_{i+1}, p_{i+1})$, where $a_{i+1} = p_i \\pmod{a'_i}$ and $p_{i+1} = a'_i$.\n$4. $ Since $a'_i$ is odd and $1  a'_i  p_i$ (if $a'_i > 1$), we have $0 \\le p_i \\pmod{a'_i}  a'_i$.\n$5.$ The sequence of denominators is $p_0, p_1, p_2, \\ldots$. From the update rule, $p_{i+1} = a'_i$. Since $a'_i \\le a_i  p_i$, we have $p_{i+1}  p_i$.\n$6.$ The sequence of denominators $\\{p_i\\}$ is a strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers.\n$7.$ Any strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers must be finite. It must eventually reach a state where the loop terminates. The loop terminates if $a_i$ becomes $0$ or $1$.\n\nThis argument structure is analogous to the proof of termination for the Euclidean algorithm. The values of the denominators form a strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers, which guarantees the process will end.\n\n### $3.$ Proof of Correctness\n\nThe correctness of the algorithm is established by showing that the value $V = k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)$ is an invariant throughout the execution of the loop, where $k$ is the accumulated sign and $(a, p)$ is the current pair of numerator and denominator.\n\n**Initial State:**\nInitially, $k=1$, and the pair is $(a_{in}, p_{in})$. The first step computes $a_0 = a_{in} \\pmod{p_{in}}$. The invariant at this point is $V_0 = 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{a_0}{p_{in}}\\right)$. By the property of the Legendre symbol, $\\left(\\frac{a_{in}}{p_{in}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a_{in} \\pmod{p_{in}}}{p_{in}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a_0}{p_{in}}\\right)$. So the invariant holds. Note that this initial reduction correctly handles negative $a_{in}$ due to the definition of the modulo operator.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nLet the state at the beginning of an iteration be $(k_i, a_i, p_i)$, with the invariant value $V_i = k_i \\left(\\frac{a_i}{p_i}\\right)$.\n\n$1.$ **Factoring out $2$s:** Let $a_i = 2^s \\cdot m$, where $m$ is odd. The algorithm updates $k_{i+1} = k_i \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{p_i}\\right)^s$ and $a_{i+1} = m$. The denominator $p_{i+1} = p_i$ is unchanged for this step.\nThe new invariant value is $V_{i+1} = k_{i+1} \\left(\\frac{a_{i+1}}{p_{i+1}}\\right) = \\left(k_i \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{p_i}\\right)^s\\right) \\left(\\frac{m}{p_i}\\right) = k_i \\left(\\frac{2^s m}{p_i}\\right) = k_i \\left(\\frac{a_i}{p_i}\\right) = V_i$. The value is preserved.\n\n$2.$ **Reciprocity Step:** After factoring out $2$s, we have a state $(k_j, a_j, p_j)$ where $a_j$ is odd. The algorithm updates the sign to $k_{j+1} = k_j \\cdot (-1)^{\\frac{a_j-1}{2}\\frac{p_j-1}{2}}$. It then sets the new pair for the next loop iteration to $(a_{j+1}, p_{j+1}) = (p_j \\pmod{a_j}, a_j)$. The value we want to preserve is $V_j = k_j \\left(\\frac{a_j}{p_j}\\right)$.\nBy the law of quadratic reciprocity, $\\left(\\frac{a_j}{p_j}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p_j}{a_j}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{a_j-1}{2}\\frac{p_j-1}{2}}$.\nSo, $V_j = k_j \\left(\\frac{p_j}{a_j}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{a_j-1}{2}\\frac{p_j-1}{2}}$.\nThe value represented by the next state is $V_{next} = k_{j+1} \\left(\\frac{a_{j+1}}{p_{j+1}}\\right) = \\left( k_j (-1)^{\\frac{a_j-1}{2}\\frac{p_j-1}{2}} \\right) \\left(\\frac{p_j \\pmod{a_j}}{a_j}\\right)$.\nUsing the property $\\left(\\frac{p_j \\pmod{a_j}}{a_j}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p_j}{a_j}\\right)$, we have $V_{next} = k_j (-1)^{\\frac{a_j-1}{2}\\frac{p_j-1}{2}} \\left(\\frac{p_j}{a_j}\\right)$.\nThis is exactly equal to $V_j$. The invariant is preserved across the reciprocity step.\n\n**Termination:**\nThe algorithm terminates when $a$ becomes $0$ or $1$.\n- If $a=0$, the algorithm returns $0$. The invariant value at this point would be $k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0}{p}\\right) = k \\cdot 0 = 0$. This is correct.\n- If $a=1$, the algorithm returns the accumulated sign $k$. The invariant value is $k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right) = k \\cdot 1 = k$. This is also correct.\n\nSince the invariant $V$ is preserved at every step of the algorithm and the final value computed at termination is correct, the initial value $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)$ is correctly computed.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by computing the Legendre symbol for a list of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def legendre_symbol(a: int, p: int) - int:\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the Legendre symbol (a/p) using an iterative algorithm based\n        on quadratic reciprocity and supplementary laws.\n\n        Args:\n            a: An integer.\n            p: An odd prime number.\n\n        Returns:\n            The value of the Legendre symbol, which is -1, 0, or 1.\n        \"\"\"\n        if p = 2 or p % 2 == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"p must be an odd prime.\")\n            \n        # Step 1: Reduce a modulo p.
