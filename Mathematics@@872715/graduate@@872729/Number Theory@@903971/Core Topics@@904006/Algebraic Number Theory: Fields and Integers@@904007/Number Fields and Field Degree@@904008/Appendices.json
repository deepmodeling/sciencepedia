The solution must be based on the principle that the degree of a simple algebraic extension equals the degree of the minimal polynomial of the generating element, and on the multiplicativity of degrees in a tower of field extensions.\n\nLet the algebraic number be denoted by $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$. The field extension in question is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of this extension, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$, is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Our first step is to find this minimal polynomial.\n\nWe start by manipulating the expression for $\\alpha$ to eliminate the square roots and find a polynomial with rational coefficients that has $\\alpha$ as a root.\n$$ \\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} $$\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n$$ \\alpha^2 = (\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3})^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3} + (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2 + 2\\sqrt{6} + 3 = 5 + 2\\sqrt{6} $$\nNow, we isolate the remaining square root term:\n$$ \\alpha^2 - 5 = 2\\sqrt{6} $$\nSquaring both sides again eliminates the final square root:\n$$ (\\alpha^2 - 5)^2 = (2\\sqrt{6})^2 $$\n$$ \\alpha^4 - 10\\alpha^2 + 25 = 4 \\times 6 = 24 $$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain a polynomial equation with $\\alpha$ as a root:\n$$ \\alpha^4 - 10\\alpha^2 + 1 = 0 $$\nThus, $\\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$. The degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ must divide the degree of any polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ for which $\\alpha$ is a root. Therefore, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] \\le 4$. To show that $P(x)$ is the minimal polynomial, we must prove that it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWe can test for irreducibility. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of $P(x)$ must be a divisor of the constant term $1$, so the only possible rational roots are $\\pm 1$.\nFor $x=1$: $P(1) = 1^4 - 10(1)^2 + 1 = 1 - 10 + 1 = -8 \\neq 0$.\nFor $x=-1$: $P(-1) = (-1)^4 - 10(-1)^2 + 1 = 1 - 10 + 1 = -8 \\neq 0$.\nSince $P(x)$ has no rational roots, it has no linear factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nNext, we check for quadratic factors. If $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it must be the product of two quadratic polynomials. By Gauss's Lemma, if it can be factored over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it can be factored over the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$. Let us assume such a factorization exists:\n$$ x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) $$\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Expanding the right side gives:\n$$ x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (b+d+ac)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd $$\nComparing coefficients with $x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$:\n$1.$ Coefficient of $x^3$: $a+c = 0 \\implies c = -a$.\n$2.$ Coefficient of $x$: $ad+bc = 0 \\implies ad-ab = 0 \\implies a(d-b) = 0$. This implies either $a=0$ or $d=b$.\n$3.$ Constant term: $bd = 1$. Since $b, d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the only possibilities are $(b,d) = (1,1)$ or $(b,d) = (-1,-1)$.\n$4.$ Coefficient of $x^2$: $b+d+ac = -10 \\implies b+d-a^2 = -10$.\n\nLet's examine the cases from condition $2$:\nCase I: $a=0$. Then $c=0$. The fourth equation becomes $b+d = -10$.\nIf $(b,d)=(1,1)$, then $1+1=2 \\neq -10$.\nIf $(b,d)=(-1,-1)$, then $-1+(-1)=-2 \\neq -10$.\nSo, this case leads to a contradiction.\n\nCase II: $d=b$. This is consistent with condition $3$, which gives $b^2=1$, so $b=\\pm 1$. The fourth equation becomes $2b - a^2 = -10$.\nIf $b=d=1$, then $2(1) - a^2 = -10 \\implies a^2 = 12$. There is no integer $a$ such that $a^2=12$.\nIf $b=d=-1$, then $2(-1) - a^2 = -10 \\implies -2 - a^2 = -10 \\implies a^2 = 8$. There is no integer $a$ such that $a^2=8$.\nSince both cases lead to contradictions, our assumption that $P(x)$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients is false. Therefore, $P(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince $P(x)$ is the irreducible polynomial for $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it is the minimal polynomial. The degree of the minimal polynomial is $4$. Consequently, the degree of the field extension is:\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(P(x)) = 4 $$\n\nNow, we analyze the compositum field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$ and compute its degree over $\\mathbb{Q}$ using the tower law. Consider the tower of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$.\nThe degree of the first extension is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]$. The minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2-2=0$, which is of degree $2$. Thus, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\nThe second part of the tower is the extension of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ by $\\sqrt{3}$, i.e., $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}) = (\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}))(\\sqrt{3})$. The degree $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})]$ is the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{3}$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The polynomial $x^2-3=0$ has $\\sqrt{3}$ as a root. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSuppose $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Then $\\sqrt{3}$ could be written as $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ for some $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Squaring this gives $3 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$. Since $\\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\}$ is a basis for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, this implies $2ab\\sqrt{2}=0$ and $a^2+2b^2=3$. The first equation means $a=0$ or $b=0$. If $a=0$, then $2b^2=3 \\implies b^2=3/2$, which has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}$. If $b=0$, then $a^2=3$, which also has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and the polynomial $x^2-3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSo, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2$.\n\nBy the tower law for field extension degrees:\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4 $$\n\nWe now compare the fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$.\nFirst, since $\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$, their sum $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$ must be an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ is the smallest field containing $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\alpha$, it must be a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$. This gives the inclusion $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$.\n\nWe have the tower of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$. Applying the tower law again:\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] $$\nSubstituting the degrees we calculated:\n$$ 4 = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})] \\cdot 4 $$\nThis equation implies that $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})] = 1$. A field extension of degree $1$ means the fields are identical. Therefore, we conclude that:\n$$ \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}) $$\n\nThe final output required is the integer value of $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}]$.

It is a well-posed problem in abstract algebra, specifically field theory, with all terms clearly defined and no internal contradictions or scientific inaccuracies.

Since $\\omega \\neq 1$, it must be a root of the cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_3(x) = x^2+x+1$. This quadratic polynomial has discriminant $1^2 - 4(1)(1) = -3  0$, so it has no real roots and thus no rational roots. Therefore, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of several field extension degrees. We will address them systematically.\n\n**1. Degree of $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$**\nThe element $\\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial $p(x) = x^3 - 2$. By Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, this polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $p(x)$ is monic and irreducible and has $\\alpha$ as a root, it is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of a simple algebraic extension is the degree of the minimal polynomial of the adjoined element.\nTherefore, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(x^3 - 2) = 3$.\n\n**2. Degree of $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}]$**\nThe element $\\beta$ is defined as $\\omega\\alpha$. Let's compute $\\beta^3$:\n$$ \\beta^3 = (\\omega\\alpha)^3 = \\omega^3\\alpha^3 $$\nGiven $\\omega^3=1$ and $\\alpha^3=2$, we have:\n$$ \\beta^3 = (1)(2) = 2 $$\nThis shows that $\\beta$ is also a root of the polynomial $x^3-2$. As established, $x^3-2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, it must also be the minimal polynomial of $\\beta$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(x^3 - 2) = 3$.\n\n**3. Degree of $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}]$**\nAs established earlier, the minimal polynomial of $\\omega$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\Phi_3(x) = x^2+x+1$.\nTherefore, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(x^2+x+1) = 2$.\n\n**4. Degree of $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}]$**\nThe field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ is the smallest field containing $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$. Since $\\beta = \\omega\\alpha$ and $\\alpha \\neq 0$, we can express $\\omega$ as $\\omega = \\beta/\\alpha$. This implies that $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$. Conversely, since $\\beta = \\omega\\alpha$, we have $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega)$. This shows that the fields are the same: $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega)$.\nWe can compute the degree of this extension using the Tower Law:\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] $$\nWe already know $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]=3$. The degree $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)]$ is the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\omega$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$. The minimal polynomial of $\\omega$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2+x+1$. This polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ if and only if its roots, $\\omega$ and $\\omega^2$, are elements of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nThe field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$ is a subfield of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, as $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The roots of $x^2+x+1$ are $\\omega = \\frac{-1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\\omega^2 = \\frac{-1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, which are complex and not real. Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ contains only real numbers, $\\omega \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nTherefore, the polynomial $x^2+x+1$ remains irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nSo, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)] = \\deg(x^2+x+1) = 2$.\nApplying the Tower Law:\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6 $$\n\n**5. Degree of $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}]$**\nLet $\\gamma = \\alpha+\\beta$. We can express $\\gamma$ in terms of $\\alpha$ and $\\omega$:\n$$ \\gamma = \\alpha + \\beta = \\alpha + \\omega\\alpha = \\alpha(1+\\omega) $$\nFrom the minimal polynomial of $\\omega$, we have $\\omega^2+\\omega+1=0$, which implies $1+\\omega = -\\omega^2$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma = \\alpha(-\\omega^2) = -\\alpha\\omega^2 $$\nTo find the minimal polynomial of $\\gamma$, we compute powers of $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma^3 = (-\\alpha\\omega^2)^3 = (-1)^3 (\\alpha^3) (\\omega^2)^3 = -1 \\cdot (2) \\cdot (\\omega^3)^2 = -2 \\cdot (1)^2 = -2 $$\nSo, $\\gamma$ is a root of the polynomial $q(x) = x^3+2$. By Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, $q(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, $x^3+2$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\gamma$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe degree of the extension is the degree of this minimal polynomial.\nTherefore, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(x^3+2) = 3$.\n\n**Proof that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta)$ is a proper subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$**\nFirst, we show inclusion. The element $\\alpha+\\beta$ is formed from elements $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$. Since a field is closed under addition, $\\alpha+\\beta \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$. The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta)$ is, by definition, the smallest field containing $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\alpha+\\beta$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$.\nNext, to show the subfield is proper, we must show $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$. We can compare their degrees over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = 3 $$\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = 6 $$\nSince the degrees are not equal ($3 \\neq 6$), the fields cannot be equal.

Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\theta)$ be a cubic number field, where $\\theta$ is a root of a monic, irreducible polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $3$. An element $\\alpha \\in K$ is called an algebraic integer if it is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. The set of all algebraic integers in $K$ forms a ring, $\\mathcal{O}_K$, which is the ring of integers of $K$. As a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module, $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is free of rank $3$, which means it possesses an integral basis $\\{\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\omega_3\\}$ such that any element in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ can be written uniquely as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of these basis elements.\n\nThe set $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta] = \\{a_0 + a_1\\theta + a_2\\theta^2 \\mid a_0, a_1, a_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ forms a subring of $\\mathcal{O}_K$, called an order.

This value is equal to the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$, denoted $\\text{disc}(f)$. The discriminant of the field $K$, denoted $D_K$, is defined as the discriminant of any integral basis of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. These discriminants are related by the crucial formula:\n$$\n\\text{disc}(f) = [\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]^2 D_K\n$$\nwhere $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$ is the index of the $\\mathbb{Z}$-module $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. This index is a positive integer.\n\nThe algorithm to find an integral basis for $K$ can be outlined as follows:\n\n$1$. **Identify candidate primes:** From the index formula, if a prime number $p$ divides the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$, then $p^2$ must divide $\\text{disc}(f)$. This is because $D_K$ is an integer. Thus, the set of prime numbers that can obstruct $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ from being the full ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is limited to those primes $p$ for which $p^2$ divides $\\text{disc}(f)$. If $\\text{disc}(f)$ is a square-free integer, it immediately follows that the index must be $1$, which means $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta] = \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\n$2$. **Check for index divisibility:** For each prime $p$ identified in the previous step, we must determine if $p$ actually divides the index. A key result, the Dedekind-Kummer theorem and its refinements, provides a criterion. A prime $p$ divides the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$ if and only if the reduction of the polynomial $f(x)$ modulo $p$, denoted $\\bar{f}(x)$, has a repeated irreducible factor in the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$.

Suppose the factorization modulo $p$ is $f(x) \\equiv g(x)^2 h(x) \\pmod{p}$, where $g(x)$ is a monic irreducible polynomial in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$. We can construct a candidate for a new integral element $\\alpha$ that is not in the current order. A standard choice is $\\alpha = \\frac{T(\\theta)}{p}$, where $T(x)$ is a monic lift to $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ of a specific polynomial related to the factorization, for instance, $g(x)h(x)$. One must then verify if $\\alpha$ is indeed an algebraic integer by computing its characteristic polynomial and checking if its coefficients are all integers. If $\\alpha$ is integral, we form a new, larger order $\\mathcal{O}' = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta, \\alpha]$. We find a basis for this new order, compute its discriminant (which will be $\\text{disc}(f)/p^{2k}$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$), and repeat the process starting from step $1$ with this new order and its discriminant. This procedure is repeated for each prime $p$ until no further enlargements are possible. The final basis obtained is an integral basis for $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nNow, we apply this algorithm to the specific case where $f(x) = x^3 - x - 1$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\theta)$ with $f(\\theta) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we confirm $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer that divides the constant term $-1$. The only possibilities are $\\pm 1$.\n$f(1) = 1^3 - 1 - 1 = -1 \\neq 0$.\n$f(-1) = (-1)^3 - (-1) - 1 = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \\neq 0$.\nSince $f(x)$ has no rational roots and is a cubic polynomial, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nNext, we establish our initial order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ with basis $\\{1, \\theta, \\theta^2\\}$. We compute its discriminant, which is equal to the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$. The discriminant of a cubic polynomial $x^3+ax+b$ is given by the formula $-4a^3 - 27b^2$. For $f(x) = x^3 - x - 1$, we have $a = -1$ and $b = -1$.\nSo, the discriminant is:\n$$\n\\text{disc}(f) = -4(-1)^3 - 27(-1)^2 = -4(-1) - 27(1) = 4 - 27 = -23.\n$$\nThe discriminant of the basis $\\{1, \\theta, \\theta^2\\}$ is $-23$.\n\nNow we invoke the index formula:\n$$\n\\text{disc}(f) = [\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]^2 D_K\n$$\nSubstituting the value we found:\n$$\n-23 = [\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]^2 D_K\n$$\nThe index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$ must be a positive integer. Its square must be an integer that divides $-23$. The number $-23$ is a prime number. The only perfect square that is an integer divisor of $-23$ is $1$.\nTherefore, we must have $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]^2 = 1$, which implies the index is $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]] = 1$.\n\nAn index of $1$ means that the order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ is identical to the full ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$. So, $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$, and $\\{1, \\theta, \\theta^2\\}$ is an integral basis for $K$.\nThis conclusion is also reached by applying step $1$ of the algorithm directly: we must check for primes $p$ such that $p^2$ divides $\\text{disc}(f) = -23$. As $-23$ is square-free, there are no such primes. The algorithm thus terminates immediately, confirming that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ is the maximal order.\n\nThe discriminant of the field, $D_K$, is the discriminant of an integral basis. Since $\\{1, \\theta, \\theta^2\\}$ is an integral basis, its discriminant is the field discriminant.\n$$\nD_K = \\text{disc}(1, \\theta, \\theta^2) = \\text{disc}(f) = -23.\n$$\nThe ring of integers of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\theta)$ is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$, and the field discriminant is $D_K = -23$.\nThe problem requires the field discriminant $D_K$ as the final value.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-23}\n$$", "id": "3020048"}]}
