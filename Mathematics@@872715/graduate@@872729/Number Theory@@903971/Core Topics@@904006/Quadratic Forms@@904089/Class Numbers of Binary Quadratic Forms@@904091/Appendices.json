All givens are consistent, mathematically sound, and grounded in established number theory. The definitions of a primitive positive definite form, equivalence via $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ action, and a reduced form are standard. The discriminant of the initial form $[103, 78, 59]$ is correctly calculated as $D = 78^{2} - 4(103)(59) = 6084 - 24308 = -18224$. The form is primitive as $\\gcd(103, 78, 59) = 1$ (since $103$ and $59$ are prime numbers not dividing $78$) and positive definite as $a=103 > 0$ and $D < 0$. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe reduction of a primitive positive definite binary quadratic form $[a,b,c]$ is an algorithmic procedure to find a unique representative in its equivalence class that satisfies the conditions $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$, with $b \\geq 0$ if $|b|=a$ or $a=c$. The algorithm repeatedly applies two types of transformations from $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ until the form is reduced:\n\n1.  **Swap:** If $a > c$, apply the transformation corresponding to $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This maps $[a,b,c]$ to $[c, -b, a]$.\n2.  **Shear:** If $|b| > a$, apply the transformation corresponding to $T_k = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ for an appropriate integer $k$. This transformation maps $(x,y) \\mapsto (x+ky, y)$ and changes the form $[a,b,c]$ to $[a, b+2ak, a k^2+b k+c]$. The integer $k$ is chosen to make the new middle coefficient $b' = b+2ak$ satisfy $|b'| \\leq a$.\n\nLet us now execute the reduction procedure for the given form $[a,b,c] = [103, 78, 59]$.\n\n**Path 1: Standard Reduction Algorithm**\n\n1.  **Initial Form:** $[a_0, b_0, c_0] = [103, 78, 59]$.\n    We check the reduction conditions: $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$.\n    - $|78| \\leq 103$: This is true.\n    - $103 \\leq 59$: This is false.\n    Since $a_0 > c_0$, we must apply the Swap transformation.\n    The new form is $[a_1, b_1, c_1] = [59, -78, 103]$.\n\n2.  **Second Form:** $[a_1, b_1, c_1] = [59, -78, 103]$.\n    We check the reduction conditions:\n    - $|-78| \\leq 59$: This is false, as $78 > 59$.\n    Since $|b_1| > a_1$, we must apply a Shear transformation. We need to choose an integer $k$ such that the new middle coefficient, $b_2 = b_1 + 2a_1k$, satisfies $|b_2| \\leq a_1$.\n    We must solve the inequality for an integer $k$:\n    $$|-78 + 2(59)k| \\leq 59$$\n    $$-59 \\leq -78 + 118k \\leq 59$$\n    Adding $78$ to all parts gives:\n    $$19 \\leq 118k \\leq 137$$\n    Dividing by $118$ gives:\n    $$\\frac{19}{118} \\leq k \\leq \\frac{137}{118}$$\n    Numerically, this is approximately $0.161 \\leq k \\leq 1.161$. The unique integer $k$ in this interval is $k=1$.\n    We apply the transformation with $k=1$ to the form $[59, -78, 103]$.\n    - $a_2 = a_1 = 59$.\n    - $b_2 = b_1 + 2a_1k = -78 + 2(59)(1) = -78 + 118 = 40$.\n    - $c_2 = a_1k^2 + b_1k + c_1 = 59(1)^2 + (-78)(1) + 103 = 59 - 78 + 103 = 84$.\n    The new form is $[a_2, b_2, c_2] = [59, 40, 84]$.\n\n3.  **Third Form:** $[a_2, b_2, c_2] = [59, 40, 84]$.\n    We check the reduction conditions:\n    - $|40| \\leq 59$: True.\n    - $59 \\leq 84$: True.\n    Both conditions $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$ are satisfied. We also check the boundary cases: $|b| = a$ ($40 \\neq 59$) and $a=c$ ($59 \\neq 84$) are not met, so no further conditions on $b$ apply.\n    The form $[59, 40, 84]$ is the reduced representative.\n\n**Path 2: Alternative Sequence of Substitutions**\n\nTo verify uniqueness, we start again with $[a_0, b_0, c_0] = [103, 78, 59]$ but choose a different initial transformation. Instead of the standard step of applying $S$, we will apply a different elementary transformation, corresponding to the matrix $M_k = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ k & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This transformation sends $(x,y) \\mapsto (x, kx+y)$ and maps the form $[a,b,c]$ to $[a+bk+ck^2, b+2ck, c]$.\n\n1.  **Initial Form:** $[a_0, b_0, c_0] = [103, 78, 59]$.\n    We apply the transformation and choose an integer $k$ to minimize the new leading coefficient, $a_1 = a_0+b_0k+c_0k^2 = 103+78k+59k^2$. This is a quadratic in $k$ which opens upwards, so its minimum is near the vertex at $k = -b_0/(2c_0) = -78/(2 \\times 59) = -39/59 \\approx -0.66$. The integer $k$ that minimizes $a_1$ is the nearest integer to this value, which is $k=-1$.\n    With $k=-1$, applying this to $[103, 78, 59]$:\n    - $a_1 = 103 + 78(-1) + 59(-1)^2 = 103 - 78 + 59 = 84$.\n    - $b_1 = 78 + 2(59)(-1) = 78 - 118 = -40$.\n    - $c_1 = 59$.\n    The new form is $[a_1, b_1, c_1] = [84, -40, 59]$.\n\n2.  **Second Form:** $[a_1, b_1, c_1] = [84, -40, 59]$.\n    We check the reduction conditions:\n    - $|-40| \\leq 84$: True.\n    - $84 \\leq 59$: False.\n    Since $a_1 > c_1$, we must now apply the Swap transformation ($S$). This maps $[a,b,c]$ to $[c,-b,a]$.\n    The new form is $[a_2, b_2, c_2] = [59, -(-40), 84] = [59, 40, 84]$.\n\n3.  **Third Form:** $[a_2, b_2, c_2] = [59, 40, 84]$.\n    This is the same form obtained at the end of Path 1. As established before, it is reduced.\n\nBoth paths, despite starting with different valid unimodular substitutions, converge to the same unique reduced form $[59, 40, 84]$.\n\n**Conclusion on the Class Number**\n\nThe class number $h(D)$ for a given discriminant $D$ is the number of distinct equivalence classes of primitive positive definite binary quadratic forms. The reduction algorithm is a constructive proof that every such form is equivalent to at least one reduced form. A deeper result, which our exercise illustrates, is that this reduced representative is *unique*.\n\nOur demonstration that two different sequences of valid transformations applied to the same initial form lead to the identical reduced form provides empirical evidence for this uniqueness property. Because every form in an equivalence class reduces to the same unique representative, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of equivalence classes and the set of reduced forms of that discriminant.\n\nFurthermore, the conditions for a form $[a,b,c]$ to be reduced ($|b| \\leq a \\leq c$ and $b^2-4ac = D < 0$) imply that there are only a finite number of such forms for any given $D$. Specifically, $3a^2 \\leq 4a^2 - b^2 \\leq 4ac - b^2 = -D$, so $a \\leq \\sqrt{|D|/3}$. This bounds $a$, and therefore also $b$, and for each pair $(a,b)$, $c$ is determined. Since there are finitely many choices for $a$ and $b$, there are finitely many reduced forms.\n\nThe uniqueness of the reduced representative guarantees that we can find the class number by simply enumerating this finite set of reduced forms. This ensures that the class number is a well-defined, finite integer, a fundamental concept in algebraic number theory.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 59 & 40 & 84 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3010008"}, {"introduction": "The set of equivalence classes for a given discriminant is not just a set; it forms a finite abelian group.

The entire problem is contained within the established framework of number theory. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks to perform three tasks related to the composition of two primitive, positive definite, integral binary quadratic forms, $f(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ and $f'(x',y') = a'x'^2 + b'x'y' + c'y'^2$.\nThe specific forms are given by $[a,b,c]=[2,1,3]$ and $[a',b',c']=[3,1,2]$. Both have the discriminant $D = -23$.\n\nThe composed form is denoted by $[A,B,C]$.\n\n- **Justification of the leading coefficient $A=a\\,a'$**\n\nThe law of composition for two binary quadratic forms $[a,b,c]$ and $[a',b',c']$ of the same discriminant $D$ provides a method to construct a composite form $[A,B,C]$. For the special but important case where the leading coefficients are coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(a,a')=1$, Dirichlet's method defines the leading coefficient of the composite form as $A=a\\,a'$. In this problem, we are given $a=2$ and $a'=3$, and indeed $\\gcd(2,3)=1$. The justification for this choice of $A$ is that it is the first step in a constructive algorithm that is guaranteed to produce a valid composite form. The subsequent steps demonstrate that integers $B$ and $C$ can be found such that $[A,B,C] = [a\\,a', B, C]$ is an integral form of discriminant $D$. The coprimality condition $\\gcd(a,a')=1$ is crucial as it guarantees, via the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the existence and uniqueness of the integer $B$ (modulo $2aa'$) that satisfies the required congruences, which we will now determine.\n\n- **Determination of the integer $B$**\n\nThe integer $B$ is uniquely determined by a system of congruences and an inequality. The given parameters are $a=2$, $b=1$, $a'=3$, $b'=1$, $D=-23$.\nThe leading coefficient of the composed form is $A=a\\,a' = (2)(3) = 6$.\n\nThe conditions for $B$ are:\n1.  $B \\equiv b \\pmod{2a}$. Substituting the values, we get $B \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2(2)}$, which is $B \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n2.  $B \\equiv b' \\pmod{2a'}$. Substituting the values, we get $B \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2(3)}$, which is $B \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$.\n3.  $B^2 \\equiv D \\pmod{4A}$. Substituting the values, we get $B^2 \\equiv -23 \\pmod{4(6)}$, which is $B^2 \\equiv -23 \\pmod{24}$.\n4.  $-A < B \\leq A$. Substituting the value of $A$, we get $-6 < B \\leq 6$.\n\nWe first solve the system of linear congruences for $B$:\nFrom $B \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, we can write $B = 4k+1$ for some integer $k$.\nSubstituting this into the second congruence:\n$4k+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$\n$4k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}$\nThis implies that $4k$ is a multiple of $6$. Let $4k = 6j$ for some integer $j$. Dividing by $2$ gives $2k = 3j$. Since $\\gcd(2,3)=1$, $k$ must be a multiple of $3$. So, we can write $k=3m$ for some integer $m$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $B$:\n$B = 4(3m)+1 = 12m+1$\nThis means $B$ must satisfy the congruence $B \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$. This single condition encapsulates the first two congruences.\n\nNow, we check this result against the third condition, $B^2 \\equiv -23 \\pmod{24}$.\nSince $-23 = -1 \\times 24 + 1$, we have $-23 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{24}$. So the condition becomes $B^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{24}$.\nIf $B = 12m+1$, then\n$B^2 = (12m+1)^2 = 144m^2 + 24m + 1 = 24(6m^2+m) + 1$.\nThus, $B^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{24}$. The condition is satisfied for any integer $m$.\n\nFinally, we use the inequality $-6 < B \\leq 6$ to find the unique value of $B$. We are looking for an integer $B$ of the form $12m+1$ in this interval.\nIf $m=0$, then $B=1$. This value satisfies $-6 < 1 \\leq 6$.\nIf $m=1$, then $B=13$, which is outside the interval.\nIf $m=-1$, then $B=-11$, which is also outside the interval.\nTherefore, the unique integer $B$ satisfying all conditions is $B=1$.\n\n- **Verification that $C$ is an integer**\n\nThe coefficient $C$ of the composite form is defined as $C = \\frac{B^2 - D}{4A}$.\nUsing the values $B=1$, $D=-23$, and $A=6$, we calculate $C$:\n$$ C = \\frac{1^2 - (-23)}{4(6)} = \\frac{1+23}{24} = \\frac{24}{24} = 1 $$\nSince $C=1$, $C$ is an integer.\nThis confirms that $[A,B,C]=[6,1,1]$ is a valid integral binary quadratic form. Let's check its discriminant: $B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4(6)(1) = 1-24 = -23$, which is the correct discriminant $D$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $B$.

For $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, it is $[1, 1, (1-D)/4]$.\n\nAn ambiguous class is a class $[f] \\in \\mathrm{Cl}(D)$ that is equal to its own inverse. The inverse of a class represented by the form $(a,b,c)$ is the class represented by $(a,-b,c)$. Thus, a class $[a,b,c]$ is ambiguous if and only if $[a,b,c] = [a,-b,c]$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all ambiguous classes in $\\mathrm{Cl}(D)$.\n\n**Part 1: The Set of Ambiguous Classes as a Subgroup**\n\nWe want to show that $S$ is a subgroup of $\\mathrm{Cl}(D)$. We use the one-step subgroup test. The definition of an ambiguous class $[f]$ is $[f] = [f]^{-1}$. Multiplying by $[f]$ on the right, we get an equivalent condition: $[f]^2 = [I]$, where $[I]$ is the identity class. So, the set of ambiguous classes is precisely the set of elements in $\\mathrm{Cl}(D)$ of order $1$ or $2$. This is also known as the $2$-torsion subgroup of $\\mathrm{Cl}(D)$, often denoted $\\mathrm{Cl}(D)[2]$.\n\n1.  **Non-emptiness**: The identity class $[I]$ satisfies $[I]^2 = [I]$, so $[I] \\in S$. Thus, $S$ is not empty.\n\n2.  **Closure under the group operation**: Let $[f_1]$ and $[f_2]$ be two elements of $S$. By definition, $[f_1]^2 = [I]$ and $[f_2]^2 = [I]$. We must show that their product, $[f_1][f_2]$, is also in $S$. We check if $([f_1][f_2])^2 = [I]$.\n    $$ ([f_1][f_2])^2 = ([f_1][f_2])([f_1][f_2]) $$\n    Since $\\mathrm{Cl}(D)$ is an abelian group under Gauss composition, we can commute the elements:\n    $$ ([f_1][f_2])^2 = [f_1]^2 [f_2]^2 = [I][I] = [I] $$\n    Thus, $[f_1][f_2] \\in S$, so $S$ is closed under the group operation.\n\n3.  **Closure under inverses**: Let $[f] \\in S$. We must show that its inverse, $[f]^{-1}$, is also in $S$. The condition for an element to be in $S$ is that its square is the identity. We check $([f]^{-1})^2$:\n    $$ ([f]^{-1})^2 = ([f]^2)^{-1} = [I]^{-1} = [I] $$\n    Thus, $[f]^{-1} \\in S$. (Alternatively, since $[f] \\in S$ means $[f] = [f]^{-1}$, the inverse of $[f]$ is $[f]$ itself, which is in $S$ by assumption).\n\nSince $S$ is a non-empty subset of $\\mathrm{Cl}(D)$ that is closed under the group operation and under taking inverses, $S$ is a subgroup of $\\mathrm{Cl}(D)$.\n\n**Part 2: The Exponent of the Subgroup of Ambiguous Classes**\n\nThe exponent of a group $G$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $g^n=e$ for all $g \\in G$, where $e$ is the identity element.\nFor the subgroup $S$ of ambiguous classes, every element $[f] \\in S$ satisfies $[f]^2 = [I]$ by definition.\nThe order of the identity element $[I]$ is $1$, and $[I]^2=[I]$. The order of any non-identity element in $S$ is $2$.\nThe exponent is the least common multiple of the orders of all elements in the subgroup. If $S$ contains only the identity, the exponent is $1$. If $S$ contains any element of order $2$, the exponent must be a multiple of $2$. Since $g^2=e$ for all $g \\in S$, the exponent is at most $2$. Therefore, if $S$ is not the trivial group, its exponent is exactly $2$.\n\n**Part 3: Size of the Ambiguous Subgroup for $D=-20$**\n\nThe discriminant is $D=-20$. This is a fundamental discriminant because $D/4 = -5$, which is square-free, and $-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\nTo find the size of the subgroup of ambiguous classes, we first determine the structure of the entire class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(-20)$ by finding all its elements. The elements of the class group are in one-to-one correspondence with the primitive positive definite binary quadratic forms $(a,b,c)$ that are reduced.\n\nA form $(a,b,c)$ with $D<0$ is reduced if $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$, and if either $|b|=a$ or $a=c$, then $b \\geq 0$. We need to find all integer triples $(a,b,c)$ satisfying these conditions and $b^2 - 4ac = -20$, with $\\gcd(a,b,c)=1$.\n\nFrom $b^2 - 4ac = -20$, we have $4ac = b^2+20$. Since the form is positive definite, $a>0$. The condition $|b| \\leq a$ implies $b^2 \\leq a^2$. The condition $a \\leq c$ implies $4a^2 \\leq 4ac$.\nCombining these, we get $4a^2 \\leq 4ac = b^2+20 \\leq a^2+20$.\nThis leads to the inequality $3a^2 \\leq 20$, which implies $a^2 \\leq 20/3 \\approx 6.67$.\nThe possible integer values for $a$ are $1$ and $2$.\n\nCase 1: $a=1$.\nFrom $|b| \\leq a=1$, we have $b \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n- If $b=0$: $4(1)c = 0^2+20 \\implies 4c=20 \\implies c=5$. This gives the form $(1,0,5)$.\n  We check if it is reduced: $|0| \\leq 1 \\leq 5$. Yes.\n  We check if it is primitive: $\\gcd(1,0,5)=1$. Yes.\n  This form is the principal form for $D=-20$, representing the identity class $[I]$.\n\n- If $b = \\pm 1$: $4(1)c = (\\pm 1)^2+20 \\implies 4c=21$. This does not yield an integer solution for $c$.\n\nCase 2: $a=2$.\nFrom $|b| \\leq a=2$, we have $b \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$.\n- If $b=0$: $4(2)c = 0^2+20 \\implies 8c=20$. No integer solution for $c$.\n- If $b=\\pm 1$: $4(2)c = (\\pm 1)^2+20 \\implies 8c=21$. No integer solution for $c$.\n- If $b=\\pm 2$: $4(2)c = (\\pm 2)^2+20 \\implies 8c=24 \\implies c=3$. This gives forms $(2,2,3)$ and $(2,-2,3)$.\n  For $(2,2,3)$: We check if it is reduced. $|2| \\leq 2 \\leq 3$ is true. Since $|b|=a$, we must have $b \\geq 0$. As $b=2$, this condition is met. So $(2,2,3)$ is a reduced form.\n  Primitivity: $\\gcd(2,2,3)=1$. Yes.\n  For $(2,-2,3)$: We check if it is reduced. $|-2| \\leq 2 \\leq 3$ is true. However, $|b|=a$ holds, and the condition $b \\geq 0$ is not met since $b=-2$. Thus, $(2,-2,3)$ is not a reduced form. It is properly equivalent to $(2,2,3)$.\n\nThe set of reduced forms for $D=-20$ is $\\{(1,0,5), (2,2,3)\\}$.\nThis means the class number is $h(-20)=2$. The class group is $\\mathrm{Cl}(-20) = \\{[1,0,5], [2,2,3]\\}$. Any group of order $2$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group $C_2$.\n\nNow we must identify which of these classes are ambiguous. An ambiguous class is an element $[f]$ such that $[f]^2=[I]$.\n1. The identity class, $[1,0,5]$, is always ambiguous as $[I]^2=[I]$. Its inverse is $[1,-0,5]=[1,0,5]$.\n2. The other class is $[2,2,3]$. Since the group has order $2$, this element must have order $2$. Therefore, $[2,2,3]^2 = [1,0,5] = [I]$. This means $[2,2,3]$ is also an ambiguous class. We can also verify this by checking its inverse: the inverse of $[2,2,3]$ is $[2,-2,3]$. As noted earlier, the form $(2,-2,3)$ is properly equivalent to $(2,2,3)$, so $[2,-2,3]=[2,2,3]$, which is the definition of an ambiguous class.\n\nBoth classes in $\\mathrm{Cl}(-20)$ are ambiguous. The subgroup of ambiguous classes is the entire group $\\mathrm{Cl}(-20)$.\nThe size of this subgroup is therefore the order of the group, which is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3009979"}]}
