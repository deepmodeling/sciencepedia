It provides a set of definitions and foundational theorems and asks for a derivation of a standard criterion, an explanation of a related theorem, and a verification of the result in a specific case. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains sufficient information for a rigorous solution.\n\nLet $L/K$ be a finite Galois extension of number fields with Galois group $G=\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)$. Let $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ and $\\mathcal{O}_{L}$ be the respective rings of integers. Let $\\mathfrak{p}$ be a nonzero prime ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$, and let $\\mathfrak{P}$ be a prime ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_{L}$ lying above $\\mathfrak{p}$, i.e., $\\mathfrak{p} = \\mathfrak{P} \\cap \\mathcal{O}_{K}$.\n\nThe decomposition group of $\\mathfrak{P}$ is defined as the subgroup of $G$ that fixes $\\mathfrak{P}$:\n$$D(\\mathfrak{P}) = \\{ \\sigma \\in G \\mid \\sigma(\\mathfrak{P}) = \\mathfrak{P} \\}$$\nEach $\\sigma \\in D(\\mathfrak{P})$ induces a well-defined automorphism $\\bar{\\sigma}$ of the residue field $\\mathcal{O}_{L}/\\mathfrak{P}$ given by $\\bar{\\sigma}(x + \\mathfrak{P}) = \\sigma(x) + \\mathfrak{P}$. This automorphism fixes the subfield $\\mathcal{O}_{K}/\\mathfrak{p}$. The mapping $\\sigma \\mapsto \\bar{\\sigma}$ constitutes a group homomorphism from $D(\\mathfrak{P})$ to the Galois group of the residue field extension, $\\operatorname{Gal}((\\mathcal{O}_{L}/\\mathfrak{P})/(\\mathcal{O}_{K}/\\mathfrak{p}))$.\n\nThe inertia subgroup of $\\mathfrak{P}$, denoted $I(\\mathfrak{P})$, is the kernel of this homomorphism:\n$$I(\\mathfrak{P}) = \\{ \\sigma \\in D(\\mathfrak{P}) \\mid \\forall x \\in \\mathcal{O}_{L}, \\; \\sigma(x) \\equiv x \\pmod{\\mathfrak{P}} \\}$$\n$I(\\mathfrak{P})$ is a normal subgroup of $D(\\mathfrak{P})$. Trivial inertia at $\\mathfrak{P}$ means $I(\\mathfrak{P})$ is the trivial group, containing only the identity element.\n\nWe now derive the criterion for trivial inertia.\nThe problem provides two foundational facts:\n1. The different ideal $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$ of the extension $L/K$ is an ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_{L}$. A prime $\\mathfrak{p} \\subset \\mathcal{O}_K$ ramifies in $L/K$ if and only if there exists a prime $\\mathfrak{P} \\subset \\mathcal{O}_L$ lying above $\\mathfrak{p}$ such that $\\mathfrak{P}$ divides $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$.\n2. The relative discriminant $\\Delta_{L/K}$ is an ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ defined as the norm of the different: $\\Delta_{L/K} = \\operatorname{Norm}_{L/K}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K})$.\n\nA prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ is said to be unramified in $L$ if the ramification index $e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$ is equal to $1$ for all primes $\\mathfrak{P}$ lying above $\\mathfrak{p}$. If the extension is Galois, the ramification indices for all primes $\\mathfrak{P}$ above a given $\\mathfrak{p}$ are equal, so we can speak of the ramification index $e_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ of $\\mathfrak{p}$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified if and only if $e_{\\mathfrak{p}} = 1$.\n\nA fundamental theorem connecting the different to ramification states that for any prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ of $\\mathcal{O}_L$ lying over $\\mathfrak{p}$, the exponent of $\\mathfrak{P}$ in the prime factorization of the different, $v_{\\mathfrak{P}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K})$, satisfies $v_{\\mathfrak{P}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}) \\geq e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) - 1$. Crucially, $\\mathfrak{P}$ is unramified, i.e., $e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})=1$, if and only if $v_{\\mathfrak{P}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K})=0$. This is equivalent to saying $\\mathfrak{P}$ does not divide $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$.\n\nCombining this with the first foundational fact, $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified if and only if no prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ above $\\mathfrak{p}$ divides $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$.\n\nNow we relate this to the discriminant $\\Delta_{L/K}$. The norm of an ideal is multiplicative. Let the prime factorization of the different in $\\mathcal{O}_L$ be $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K} = \\prod_{i} \\mathfrak{P}_i^{a_i}$. Then the discriminant is\n$$ \\Delta_{L/K} = \\operatorname{Norm}_{L/K}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}) = \\operatorname{Norm}_{L/K}\\left(\\prod_{i} \\mathfrak{P}_i^{a_i}\\right) = \\prod_{i} \\left(\\operatorname{Norm}_{L/K}(\\mathfrak{P}_i)\\right)^{a_i} $$\nLet $\\mathfrak{p}_i = \\mathfrak{P}_i \\cap \\mathcal{O}_K$. By definition of the norm of a prime ideal, $\\operatorname{Norm}_{L/K}(\\mathfrak{P}_i) = \\mathfrak{p}_i^{f(\\mathfrak{P}_i/\\mathfrak{p}_i)}$.\nA prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ divides $\\Delta_{L/K}$ if and only if there is a prime factor $\\mathfrak{p}_i$ in the factorization of $\\Delta_{L/K}$ with $\\mathfrak{p}_i = \\mathfrak{p}$. This occurs if and only if there is some prime factor $\\mathfrak{P}_i$ of $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$ such that $\\mathfrak{P}_i$ lies over $\\mathfrak{p}$.\nTherefore, we have the following chain of equivalences:\n$\\mathfrak{p}$ divides $\\Delta_{L/K}$ $\\iff$ there exists $\\mathfrak{P} \\mid \\mathfrak{p}$ such that $\\mathfrak{P}$ divides $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$ $\\iff$ there exists $\\mathfrak{P} \\mid \\mathfrak{p}$ such that $v_{\\mathfrak{P}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K})  0$ $\\iff$ there exists $\\mathfrak{P} \\mid \\mathfrak{p}$ such that $e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})  1$ $\\iff$ $\\mathfrak{p}$ ramifies in $L/K$.\nConsequently, $\\mathfrak{p}$ does not divide $\\Delta_{L/K}$ if and only if $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified, meaning $e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) = 1$ for all $\\mathfrak{P}$ above $\\mathfrak{p}$.\n\nNext, we explain why $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$ for a Galois extension. The homomorphism $\\phi: D(\\mathfrak{P}) \\to \\operatorname{Gal}((\\mathcal{O}_{L}/\\mathfrak{P})/(\\mathcal{O}_{K}/\\mathfrak{p}))$ is surjective. Its kernel is $I(\\mathfrak{P})$. By the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, we have:\n$$ D(\\mathfrak{P})/I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\cong \\operatorname{Gal}((\\mathcal{O}_{L}/\\mathfrak{P})/(\\mathcal{O}_{K}/\\mathfrak{p})) $$\nThe order of the Galois group of the residue field extension is the degree of this extension, which is the residue degree $f(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$. Thus, $\\lvert D(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert / \\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = f(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$.\nFor a Galois extension, it is a fundamental result that the order of the decomposition group is $\\lvert D(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) f(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$.\nSubstituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) f(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})}{\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert} = f(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) $$\nwhich simplifies to $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$.\n\nFinally, we conclude that trivial inertia at $\\mathfrak{P}$ is equivalent to $\\mathfrak{p}$ not dividing $\\Delta_{L/K}$.\nTrivial inertia at $\\mathfrak{P}$ means $I(\\mathfrak{P}) = \\{1_{\\text{id}}\\}$, which is equivalent to $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = 1$.\nFrom the relation just derived, $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = 1$ is equivalent to $e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) = 1$.\nSince the extension is Galois, $e(\\mathfrak{P}'/\\mathfrak{p}) = e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$ for any other prime $\\mathfrak{P}'$ above $\\mathfrak{p}$. So, $e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})=1$ means that $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified.\nAs established earlier, $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified if and only if $\\mathfrak{p}$ does not divide the relative discriminant $\\Delta_{L/K}$.\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNow, we verify this criterion for $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{21})$ over $K=\\mathbb{Q}$ and the prime $p=5$.\nThis is a quadratic extension of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d=21$. Since $d$ is square-free and $21 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_{L} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{21}}{2}]$, and the absolute discriminant is $\\Delta_{L/\\mathbb{Q}} = d = 21$.\nThe principal ideal generated by the discriminant in $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}$ is $(21)$. The prime factors of this ideal are $(3)$ and $(7)$.\nAccording to our criterion, a rational prime $p$ ramifies in $L$ if and only if its corresponding ideal $(p)$ divides the discriminant ideal $(21)$, which means $p$ must be $3$ or $7$. All other primes are unramified.\n\nWe are asked to consider the prime $p=5$. Since $5$ does not divide $21$, the prime $(5)$ is unramified in $L$. This means the ramification index $e(\\mathfrak{P}/(5))$ must be $1$ for any prime ideal $\\mathfrak{P}$ in $\\mathcal{O}_L$ lying above $(5)$.\nThe problem asks for the order of the inertia group, $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert$. Using the established relation for Galois extensions:\n$$ \\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = e(\\mathfrak{P}/(5)) $$\nSince $(5)$ is unramified, we have $e(\\mathfrak{P}/(5)) = 1$.\nTherefore, $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = 1$.\nThis verifies the criterion: the prime $p=5$ does not divide the discriminant $\\Delta_{L/\\mathbb{Q}} = 21$, and the corresponding inertia subgroup is indeed trivial, having order $1$.\n\nTo be explicit, we can check the behavior of the prime $5$ using the Legendre symbol. For a prime $p$ not dividing $2d$, its behavior in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is determined by $(\\frac{d}{p})$.\nHere, $d=21$ and $p=5$. We compute the Legendre symbol:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{21}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{21 \\pmod 5}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 1 $$\nSince the symbol is $1$, the prime $5$ splits in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{21})$. This means the ideal $(5)\\mathcal{O}_L$ factors into two distinct prime ideals, $(5) = \\mathfrak{P}_1 \\mathfrak{P}_2$. The number of primes above $(5)$ is $g=2$. For a Galois extension, we have the relation $efg = [L:K] = 2$. With $g=2$, we have $e \\cdot f \\cdot 2 = 2$, which implies $ef=1$. Since $e$ and $f$ are positive integers, this requires $e=1$ and $f=1$.\nThe ramification index is $e=1$, which confirms our previous conclusion. The order of the inertia group for any prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ above $(5)$ is $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = e = 1$.\nThe final answer is the integer value of $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3027273"}, {"introduction": "Having established the global criterion for ramification, we now zoom into the local picture to dissect the structure of the inertia group itself.

Since the degree $n$ is coprime to the residue characteristic $p$, this is a a tamely ramified extension.\n\nTo find the ramification breaks, we must compute the valuation $v_{L_{1}}(\\gamma(\\pi_{1})-\\pi_{1})$ for any non-identity element $\\gamma \\in G$. Any such element is of the form $\\sigma^{k}$ for some $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$.\n\nThe action of $\\sigma^{k}$ on $\\pi_{1}$ is $\\sigma^{k}(\\pi_{1}) = \\zeta_{n}^{k}\\pi_{1}$. We compute the valuation:\n$$v_{L_{1}}(\\sigma^{k}(\\pi_{1})-\\pi_{1}) = v_{L_{1}}(\\zeta_{n}^{k}\\pi_{1}-\\pi_{1}) = v_{L_{1}}(\\pi_{1}(\\zeta_{n}^{k}-1))$$\nUsing the properties of valuations, this is:\n$$v_{L_{1}}(\\pi_{1}(\\zeta_{n}^{k}-1)) = v_{L_{1}}(\\pi_{1}) + v_{L_{1}}(\\zeta_{n}^{k}-1)$$\nWe have $v_{L_{1}}(\\pi_{1})=1$. The element $\\zeta_{n}^{k}-1$ is in the base field $K$, so $v_{L_{1}}(\\zeta_{n}^{k}-1) = n \\cdot v_{K}(\\zeta_{n}^{k}-1)$.\n\nThe problem states as a fact that $v_{K}(\\zeta_{n}-1)=0$ because $\\gcd(n,p)=1$. For any $k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, $\\zeta_{n}^{k}$ is an $n$-th root of unity different from $1$. The minimal polynomial of $\\zeta_n^k$ over the prime field has coefficients that are integers.

This is consistent with $L_{1}/K$ being tamely ramified, for which the wild inertia subgroup $G_{1}$ must be trivial.\n\n**Part 2: The Wild Extension $L_{2}/K$**\n\nThe extension $L_{2}/K$ is defined by adjoining a root $\\pi_{2}$ of the polynomial $X^{p}-\\pi_{K}=0$. This is a totally ramified extension of degree $[L_{2}:K]=p$. The valuation $v_{L_{2}}$ on $L_{2}$ is related to $v_{K}$ by $v_{L_{2}}(x) = p \\cdot v_{K}(x)$ for any $x \\in K$.\n\nSimilar to the first case, $\\pi_{2}$ is a uniformizer for $L_{2}$, and $v_{L_{2}}(\\pi_{2})=1$.\n\nThe Galois group $H = \\mathrm{Gal}(L_{2}/K)$ is cyclic of order $p$, generated by an element $\\tau$ such that $\\tau(\\pi_{2})=\\zeta_{p}\\pi_{2}$ for a primitive $p$-th root of unity $\\zeta_{p} \\in K$. Since the degree $p$ is equal to the residue characteristic, this is a wildly ramified extension.\n\nWe compute $v_{L_{2}}(\\gamma(\\pi_{2})-\\pi_{2})$ for any non-identity element $\\gamma=\\tau^{k} \\in H$, where $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, p-1\\}$.\n$$v_{L_{2}}(\\tau^{k}(\\pi_{2})-\\pi_{2}) = v_{L_{2}}(\\zeta_{p}^{k}\\pi_{2}-\\pi_{2}) = v_{L_{2}}(\\pi_{2}) + v_{L_{2}}(\\zeta_{p}^{k}-1) = 1 + p \\cdot v_{K}(\\zeta_{p}^{k}-1)$$\nWe are given the fact that $v_{K}(\\zeta_{p}-1)=\\frac{1}{p-1}$. For $k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, p-1\\}$, we have the identity $\\zeta_{p}^{k}-1 = (\\zeta_{p}-1)(1+\\zeta_{p}+\\dots+\\zeta_{p}^{k-1})$.\nThe valuation is $v_{K}(\\zeta_{p}^{k}-1) = v_{K}(\\zeta_{p}-1) + v_{K}(1+\\zeta_{p}+\\dots+\\zeta_{p}^{k-1})$.\nGiven $v_{K}(\\zeta_{p}-1)  0$, we have $\\zeta_{p} \\equiv 1$ modulo the maximal ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. Thus, the sum $1+\\zeta_{p}+\\dots+\\zeta_{p}^{k-1}$ is congruent to $k$ modulo the maximal ideal. Since $k$ is not a multiple of $p$, $v_K(k)=0$ and $k$ is a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Therefore, $v_{K}(1+\\zeta_{p}+\\dots+\\zeta_{p}^{k-1})=0$.\nThis implies $v_{K}(\\zeta_{p}^{k}-1) = v_{K}(\\zeta_{p}-1) = \\frac{1}{p-1}$ for all $k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, p-1\\}$.\n\nSubstituting this into our calculation:\n$$v_{L_{2}}(\\tau^{k}(\\pi_{2})-\\pi_{2}) = 1 + p \\cdot \\frac{1}{p-1} = \\frac{p-1+p}{p-1} = \\frac{2p-1}{p-1}$$\nThis value is constant for all non-identity elements of $H$. Let $v = \\frac{2p-1}{p-1}$.\n\nNow we determine the ramification groups $H_{i} = \\{\\gamma \\in H : v_{L_{2}}(\\gamma(\\pi_{2})-\\pi_{2}) \\geq i+1\\}$.\nA non-identity element $\\gamma$ is in $H_{i}$ if and only if $v \\geq i+1$.\n$$v = \\frac{2p-1}{p-1} = \\frac{2(p-1)+1}{p-1} = 2 + \\frac{1}{p-1}$$\nThe condition is $2 + \\frac{1}{p-1} \\geq i+1$, which is equivalent to $i \\leq 1 + \\frac{1}{p-1}$.\nSince $p \\geq 3$ is a prime, $p-1 \\geq 2$, so $0  \\frac{1}{p-1} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- For $i=0$: $0 \\leq 1+\\frac{1}{p-1}$ is true. So $H_{0}=H$.\n- For $i=1$: $1 \\leq 1+\\frac{1}{p-1}$ is true. So $H_{1}=H$.\n- For $i=2$: $2 \\leq 1+\\frac{1}{p-1}$ simplifies to $1 \\leq \\frac{1}{p-1}$, or $p-1 \\leq 1$, so $p \\leq 2$. This contradicts $p \\geq 3$. Thus, for $i \\geq 2$, no non-identity element satisfies the condition, so $H_{i}=\\{1\\}$.\n\nThe chain of ramification subgroups is $H = H_{0} = H_{1} \\supsetneq H_{2} = \\{1\\}$.\nThe ramification break occurs at an integer $b$ where $H_{b} \\supsetneq H_{b+1}$.\n- For $b=0$: We have $H_{0}=H_{1}=H$, so $b=0$ is not a break point.\n- For $b=1$: We have $H_{1}=H$ and $H_{2}=\\{1\\}$, so $H_{1} \\supsetneq H_{2}$.

We must derive the structure of the extension, the order of its inertia group, and its unique upper ramification break from first principles.\n\n**1. Degree and Structure of the Extension $L/K$**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^p - x - a \\in K[x]$. The extension $L$ is the splitting field of $f(x)$ since if $\\alpha$ is a root, then so are $\\alpha+1, \\alpha+2, \\ldots, \\alpha+(p-1)$, and these are all distinct as the characteristic is $p$. Hence, $L/K$ is a Galois extension.\n\nTo find the degree $[L:K]$, we check the irreducibility of $f(x)$. Assume $f(x)$ has a root $\\beta \\in K$. Thus, $\\beta^p - \\beta = a$. We analyze this equation using the valuation $v_K$.\n- If $v_K(\\beta)  0$, then $v_K(\\beta^p) = p \\cdot v_K(\\beta)  v_K(\\beta)$. The valuation of a sum is the minimum of the valuations, so $v_K(\\beta^p - \\beta) = v_K(\\beta^p) = p \\cdot v_K(\\beta)$. Equating valuations, we have $p \\cdot v_K(\\beta) = v_K(a) = -m$. Since $v_K(\\beta)$ must be an integer, this implies $p$ divides $m$. This contradicts the given condition $\\gcd(m,p)=1$.\n- If $v_K(\\beta) \\ge 0$, then $\\beta$ is in the valuation ring $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Consequently, $\\beta^p - \\beta$ is also in $\\mathcal{O}_K$, meaning $v_K(\\beta^p - \\beta) \\ge 0$. However, $v_K(a) = -m  0$. This is a contradiction.\n\nSince no root of $f(x)$ lies in $K$, and the degree of $f(x)$ is the prime $p$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $K$.\nTherefore, $[L:K] = p$. The Galois group is $G = \\operatorname{Gal}(L/K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$, with automorphisms $\\sigma_c: \\alpha \\mapsto \\alpha+c$ for $c \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\n**2. Ramification and the Inertia Group**\n\nLet $e$ be the ramification index and $f$ be the inertia degree of the extension $L/K$. We have the fundamental relation $ef = [L:K] = p$. Since $p$ is prime, either ($e=1, f=p$) or ($e=p, f=1$).\n\nLet $v_L$ be the unique extension of the valuation $v_K$ to $L$. The value group of $v_L$ is $\\frac{1}{e}\\mathbb{Z}$.\nIf the extension were unramified, we would have $e=1$. Then the value group of $v_L$ would be the same as for $v_K$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nAs shown above, any root $\\beta$ of $f(x)=0$ must satisfy $v_L(\\beta)  0$. For our root $\\alpha \\in L$, this condition gives $p \\cdot v_L(\\alpha) = v_L(a) = v_K(a) = -m$. This implies $v_L(\\alpha) = -m/p$. If $e=1$, $v_L(\\alpha)$ must be an integer, but $-m/p$ is not an integer since $\\gcd(m, p)=1$.\nTherefore, the extension cannot be unramified. We must have $e=p$ and $f=1$. This means the extension $L/K$ is totally ramified.\n\nSince the extension is totally ramified, the inertia group $I_v$ is the entire Galois group $G$.\nThe order of the inertia group is $\\lvert I_v \\rvert = \\lvert G \\rvert = [L:K] = p$.\n\n**3. Ramification Groups and the Lower Ramification Break**\n\nTo find the ramification break, we study the ramification groups $G_i$. It is convenient to use the normalized valuation $w_L$ on $L$, for which a uniformizer $\\pi_L$ has valuation $w_L(\\pi_L)=1$. This is related to $v_L$ by $w_L(x) = e \\cdot v_L(x) = p \\cdot v_L(x)$. The value group of $w_L$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's find the valuation of $\\alpha$. From $\\alpha^p - \\alpha = a$, and $v_L(\\alpha)  0$, we have:\n$w_L(\\alpha^p - \\alpha) = w_L(a) \\implies w_L(\\alpha^p) = w_L(a)$.\n$p \\cdot w_L(\\alpha) = p \\cdot v_L(a) = p \\cdot v_K(a) = p(-m) = -mp$.\nThus, $w_L(\\alpha) = -m$.\n\nThe ramification groups $G_i$ for $i \\ge 0$ are defined as:\n$$G_i = \\{ \\sigma \\in G_0 \\mid w_L(\\sigma(x)-x) \\geq i+1 \\text{ for all } x \\in \\mathcal{O}_L \\}$$\nwhere $G_0 = I_v = G$. Since $L/K$ is a totally ramified extension of prime degree, its ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_L$ is generated over $\\mathcal{O}_K$ by any uniformizer $\\pi_L$, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathcal{O}_K[\\pi_L]$. The condition for $\\sigma \\in G_i$ simplifies to checking the valuation of $\\sigma(\\pi_L)-\\pi_L$.\n\nWe need to find a uniformizer $\\pi_L$. The valuation of the uniformizer $\\pi$ of $K$ is $w_L(\\pi) = p \\cdot v_K(\\pi) = p \\cdot 1 = p$. We have $w_L(\\alpha) = -m$. We seek an element $\\pi_L = \\pi^i \\alpha^j$ such that $w_L(\\pi_L)=1$.\n$w_L(\\pi^i \\alpha^j) = i \\cdot w_L(\\pi) + j \\cdot w_L(\\alpha) = ip - jm$.\nWe need to solve $ip - jm = 1$. Since $\\gcd(p,m)=1$, by Bezout's identity, integers $i_0, j_0$ exist. Let's fix such a pair. Then $\\pi_L = \\pi^{i_0} \\alpha^{j_0}$ is a uniformizer for $L$.\n\nNow we compute $w_L(\\sigma_c(\\pi_L) - \\pi_L)$ for a non-trivial automorphism $\\sigma_c \\in G$ (where $c \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^*$).\n$\\sigma_c(\\pi_L) - \\pi_L = \\pi^{i_0}(\\alpha+c)^{j_0} - \\pi^{i_0}\\alpha^{j_0} = \\pi^{i_0}\\alpha^{j_0} \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{c}{\\alpha}\\right)^{j_0} - 1 \\right)$.\nThe valuation of $c/\\alpha$ is $w_L(c/\\alpha) = w_L(c) - w_L(\\alpha) = 0 - (-m) = m$. Since $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{0}$, $w_L(c/\\alpha)  0$. We can apply the binomial expansion for $(1+x)^k$ where $x=c/\\alpha$:\n$\\left(1 + \\frac{c}{\\alpha}\\right)^{j_0} - 1 = j_0\\left(\\frac{c}{\\alpha}\\right) + \\binom{j_0}{2}\\left(\\frac{c}{\\alpha}\\right)^2 + \\dots$\nThe valuation of the first term is $w_L(j_0 c \\alpha^{-1}) = w_L(j_0) + w_L(c) - w_L(\\alpha)$. The integer $j_0$ cannot be a multiple of $p$ (from $i_0p-j_0m=1$), so $w_L(j_0)=0$. Also, $w_L(c)=0$. So, the valuation is $-w_L(\\alpha)=m$. Each subsequent term in the series has a strictly higher valuation. Thus, the valuation of the entire series is $m$.\n$w_L(\\sigma_c(\\pi_L)-\\pi_L) = w_L(\\pi_L) + w_L\\left(\\left(1 + \\frac{c}{\\alpha}\\right)^{j_0} - 1\\right) = 1 + m$.\n\nThis valuation is independent of the choice of $c \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^*$.\nFor a non-trivial $\\sigma \\in G$, we have $w_L(\\sigma(\\pi_L)-\\pi_L) = m+1$.\nAn automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ belongs to $G_i$ if and only if $w_L(\\sigma(\\pi_L)-\\pi_L) \\ge i+1$.\nFor $\\sigma \\neq 1$, this means $m+1 \\ge i+1$, which simplifies to $i \\le m$.\nSo, the filtration of lower-numbered ramification groups is:\n$G_i = G$ for $i \\le m$.\n$G_i = \\{1\\}$ for $i \\ge m+1$.\nThe sequence of ramification groups has a single jump at the index $i=m$. This is the lower ramification break.\n\n**4. The Upper Ramification Break**\n\nThe upper numbering for ramification groups is obtained from the lower numbering via the Herbrand function $\\phi_{L/K}(s)$. For a real number $s \\ge -1$, it is defined by\n$$\\phi(s) = \\int_0^s \\frac{dt}{[G_0:G_t]}$$\nwhere $G_t = G_{\\lceil t \\rceil}$.\nThe indices of our ramification groups are integers, so $G_t=G_{\\lfloor t \\rfloor+1}$ if $t$ is not an integer or $G_t=G_t$ if $t$ is an integer. Let's use $G_t = G_i$ for $i \\le t  i+1$.\nFrom our filtration:\n- For $0 \\le t \\le m$, $G_t = G$. Thus $[G_0:G_t] = [G:G] = 1$.\n- For $t  m$, $G_t = \\{1\\}$. Thus $[G_0:G_t] = [G:\\{1\\}] = p$.\n\nWe can now compute $\\phi(s)$:\n- For $0 \\le s \\le m$: $\\phi(s) = \\int_0^s 1 \\, dt = s$.\n- For $s  m$: $\\phi(s) = \\int_0^m 1 \\, dt + \\int_m^s \\frac{1}{p} \\, dt = m + \\frac{s-m}{p}$.\n\nThe upper ramification breaks are the images of the lower ramification breaks under $\\phi$. The unique lower break is at $s=m$. The corresponding upper break $u$ is:\n$u = \\phi(m) = m$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- The extension $L/K$ is a totally ramified cyclic extension of degree $p$.\n- The order of the inertia group is $\\lvert I_v \\rvert = p$.\n- The unique upper ramification break is $u=m$.\n\nThe question asks for the final result as a single row matrix with the upper ramification break $u$ as the first entry and the order of the inertia group $\\lvert I_v \\rvert$ as the second entry.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} m  p \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3027288"}]}
