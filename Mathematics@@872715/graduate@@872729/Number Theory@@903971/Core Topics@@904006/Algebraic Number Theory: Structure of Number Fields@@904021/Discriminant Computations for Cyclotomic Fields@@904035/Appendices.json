The absolute discriminant is then reconstructed using the formula:\n$$\n|\\mathrm{Disc}(K)| = \\prod_{p \\text{ prime}} p^{v_{p}(|\\mathrm{Disc}(K)|)}\n$$\nA prime $p$ ramifies in a cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{n})$ if and only if $p$ divides $n$. For $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{3})$, the only prime that can ramify is $p=3$. All other primes $p \\neq 3$ are unramified.\n\nFor an unramified prime $p$, the ramification index $e$ of any prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ lying above $p$ is $1$. The $p$-adic valuation of the discriminant, $v_{p}(\\mathrm{Disc}(K))$, is related to the different ideal $\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}$ by $v_{p}(\\mathrm{Disc}(K)) = \\sum_{\\mathfrak{p}|p} f(\\mathfrak{p}|p) v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}})$.

The ideal is $\\mathfrak{p}_{3} = (3, \\zeta_{3}-1)$. The ramification index is $e=2$.\n\nNext, we must determine if the ramification is tame or wild. A prime $p$ is said to be wildly ramified if $p$ divides the ramification index $e$. Otherwise, the ramification is tame. In our case, $p=3$ and $e=2$. Since $3$ does not divide $2$, the ramification is tame.\n\nFor a tamely ramified prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$, the exponent of $\\mathfrak{p}$ in the prime factorization of the different ideal $\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}$ is given by $v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}) = e-1$. For the prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_{3}$ above $3$, we have $e=2$, so:\n$$\nv_{\\mathfrak{p}_{3}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}) = 2-1 = 1\n$$\nThe $p$-adic valuation of the discriminant is given by the formula:\n$$\nv_{p}(\\mathrm{Disc}(K)) = \\sum_{\\mathfrak{p}|p} f(\\mathfrak{p}|p) v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}})\n$$\nFor $p=3$, there is only one prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_{3}$ above it, for which $f=1$ and $v_{\\mathfrak{p}_{3}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}) = 1$.\n$$\nv_{3}(\\mathrm{Disc}(K)) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n$$\nSo, we have found that $v_{3}(|\\mathrm{Disc}(K)|)=1$ and $v_{p}(|\\mathrm{Disc}(K)|)=0$ for all other primes $p$.

Express your final answer as a single exact integer.", "solution": "The problem is to compute the absolute discriminant of the cyclotomic field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{5})$ and relate the result to ramification theory.\n\nFirst, we establish the properties of the field extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial of a primitive fifth root of unity, $\\zeta_5$, over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the fifth cyclotomic polynomial, $\\Phi_5(x)$. This can be found from the factorization $x^5-1 = (x-1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)$. Since $\\zeta_5$ is a root of $x^5-1$ but not of $x-1$, it must be a root of $\\Phi_5(x) = x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, the degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(\\Phi_5(x)) = 4$.\n\nThe problem states that the ring of integers of $K$ is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_5]$. This means that the set $\\{1, \\zeta_5, \\zeta_5^2, \\zeta_5^3\\}$ forms an integral basis for $K$. The discriminant of the field $K$, denoted $\\mathrm{Disc}(K)$, is defined as the discriminant of this integral basis.\n\nFor a power basis $\\{1, \\alpha, \\alpha^2, \\dots, \\alpha^{n-1}\\}$ generated by an element $\\alpha$ with minimal polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $n$, the discriminant is given by the formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{Disc}(1, \\alpha, \\dots, \\alpha^{n-1}) = (-1)^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(f'(\\alpha)) $$\nIn our case, $n=4$, $\\alpha=\\zeta_5$, and $f(x) = \\Phi_5(x)$. The prefactor is $(-1)^{\\frac{4(4-1)}{2}} = (-1)^{6} = 1$. Thus, the discriminant is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Disc}(K) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\Phi_5'(\\zeta_5)) $$\nTo find $\\Phi_5'(\\zeta_5)$, we use the identity $x^5 - 1 = (x-1)\\Phi_5(x)$. Differentiating both sides with respect to $x$ using the product rule gives:\n$$ 5x^4 = \\frac{d}{dx}(x-1) \\cdot \\Phi_5(x) + (x-1) \\cdot \\Phi_5'(x) $$\n$$ 5x^4 = 1 \\cdot \\Phi_5(x) + (x-1) \\Phi_5'(x) $$\nWe evaluate this identity at $x=\\zeta_5$. Since $\\zeta_5$ is a root of $\\Phi_5(x)$, we have $\\Phi_5(\\zeta_5)=0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ 5\\zeta_5^4 = (\\zeta_5-1) \\Phi_5'(\\zeta_5) $$\nSolving for $\\Phi_5'(\\zeta_5)$, we get:\n$$ \\Phi_5'(\\zeta_5) = \\frac{5\\zeta_5^4}{\\zeta_5-1} $$\nNow we compute the norm of this element to find the discriminant. The norm is multiplicative, so we have:\n$$ \\mathrm{Disc}(K) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}\\left(\\frac{5\\zeta_5^4}{\\zeta_5-1}\\right) = \\frac{N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(5\\zeta_5^4)}{N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\zeta_5-1)} $$\nWe compute the norms of the numerator and denominator separately.\nFor the numerator:\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(5\\zeta_5^4) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(5) \\cdot N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\zeta_5^4) $$\nThe norm of a rational number $q$ in a degree $n$ extension is $q^n$. Here, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(5) = 5^4 = 625$.\nThe norm of $\\zeta_5^4$ is the product of its Galois conjugates. The conjugates of $\\zeta_5$ are $\\zeta_5^j$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\zeta_5^4) = \\prod_{j=1}^{4} (\\zeta_5^4)^j = \\zeta_5^{4(1+2+3+4)} = \\zeta_5^{40} = (\\zeta_5^5)^8 = 1^8 = 1 $$\nSo the numerator is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(5\\zeta_5^4) = 5^4 \\cdot 1 = 5^4$.\n\nFor the denominator, we need to compute $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\zeta_5-1)$. The conjugates of $\\zeta_5-1$ are $\\zeta_5^j-1$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\zeta_5-1) = \\prod_{j=1}^{4} (\\zeta_5^j-1) = (-1)^4 \\prod_{j=1}^{4} (1-\\zeta_5^j) = \\prod_{j=1}^{4} (1-\\zeta_5^j) $$\nThis product is precisely the value of the cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_5(x)$ at $x=1$:\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\zeta_5-1) = \\Phi_5(1) = 1^4+1^3+1^2+1+1 = 5 $$\nCombining these results, we find the discriminant:\n$$ \\mathrm{Disc}(K) = \\frac{5^4}{5} = 5^3 = 125 $$\nThe absolute value of the discriminant is $|\\mathrm{Disc}(K)| = |125| = 125$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the exponent of the prime $5$ in $|\\mathrm{Disc}(K)|$ and its relation to ramification theory. From our calculation, $|\\mathrm{Disc}(K)| = 5^3$, so the exponent of $5$ is $3$.\n\nNow we analyze the ramification of the rational prime $p=5$ in the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$. A prime $p$ ramifies if and only if it divides the discriminant. Since $5$ divides $125$, the prime $5$ ramifies in $K$. To determine if the ramification is tame or wild, we must check if $p$ divides the ramification index $e$.\n\nThe factorization of the ideal $(5)$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is related to the element $1-\\zeta_5$. The norm of this element is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1-\\zeta_5) = \\Phi_5(1) = 5$. Since the norm of the principal ideal $(1-\\zeta_5)$ is the prime ideal $(5) \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$, the ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = (1-\\zeta_5)$ must be a prime ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of norm $5$.\nThe factorization of the ideal $(5)$ is given by:\n$$ (5) = (\\Phi_5(1)) = \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{4} (1-\\zeta_5^j)\\right) $$\nFor any $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, the element $\\frac{1-\\zeta_5^j}{1-\\zeta_5} = 1+\\zeta_5+\\dots+\\zeta_5^{j-1}$ is a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. This means that the ideals $(1-\\zeta_5^j)$ and $(1-\\zeta_5)$ are the same for all $j=1, \\dots, 4$.\nTherefore, the factorization of the ideal $(5)$ is:\n$$ (5) = (1-\\zeta_5)(1-\\zeta_5^2)(1-\\zeta_5^3)(1-\\zeta_5^4) = (1-\\zeta_5)^4 \\cdot u $$\nwhere $u$ is a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Thus, we have the ideal factorization $(5) = \\mathfrak{p}^4$ where $\\mathfrak{p}=(1-\\zeta_5)$.\nThis shows that the ramification index is $e=4$ and the residue field degree is $f=1$ (since $ef = [K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$).\n\nRamification of a prime $p$ is defined as **tame** if $p$ does not divide the ramification index $e$. Here, $p=5$ and $e=4$. Since $5$ does not divide $4$, the ramification is tame.\n\nThe \"tame ramification prediction\" refers to the Dedekind-Kummer theorem relating the discriminant and the different ideal. For a prime $p$ with factorization $(p) = \\prod \\mathfrak{p}_i^{e_i}$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$, the exponent of $p$ in the absolute discriminant is given by $v_p(|\\mathrm{Disc}(K)|) = \\sum_i f_i v_{\\mathfrak{p}_i}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}})$, where $\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}$ is the different ideal and $f_i$ is the residue degree of $\\mathfrak{p}_i$.\nFor a tamely ramified prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_i$, the exponent of $\\mathfrak{p}_i$ in the different is $v_{\\mathfrak{p}_i}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}) = e_i - 1$.\nIn our case, for $p=5$, there is only one prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ above it, with $e=4$ and $f=1$. Since the ramification is tame, this formula applies:\n$$ v_5(|\\mathrm{Disc}(K)|) = f \\cdot (e-1) = 1 \\cdot (4-1) = 3 $$\nThis theoretical prediction for the exponent of $5$ in the discriminant perfectly matches our direct computation, which yielded $5^3$. This confirms the consistency of the theory.\n\nThe final answer requested is the single exact integer value for $|\\mathrm{Disc}(K)|$.\n$$ |\\mathrm{Disc}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_5))| = 125 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{125}$$", "id": "3012095"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice advances to a composite modulus, $n=12$, which provides a more complete picture of the theory.

For the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$, a prime $p$ ramifies if and only if $p$ divides $n$. In our case, $n=12$, so the primes that ramify are $2$ and $3$. The prime factorization of $|d_K|$ will thus be of the form $2^a 3^b$. We must determine the exponents $a=v_2(d_K)$ and $b=v_3(d_K)$.\n\nThe problem requires using the formula relating the discriminant to the different ideal $\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}$. The discriminant ideal $(d_K)$ is the norm of the different ideal, $(d_K) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}})$. Taking the $p$-adic valuation for a prime $p$, we have:\n$$v_p(d_K) = v_p(N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}))$$\nThis can be expressed in terms of local data. If $p\\mathcal{O}_K = \\prod_{i=1}^g \\mathfrak{p}_i^{e_i}$ is the prime factorization of $p$ in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$, the formula is:\n$$v_p(d_K) = \\sum_{i=1}^{g} f(\\mathfrak{p}_i|p) \\cdot v_{\\mathfrak{p}_i}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}})$$\nwhere $f(\\mathfrak{p}_i|p)$ is the residue degree of the prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_i$ over $p$, and $v_{\\mathfrak{p}_i}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}})$ is the different exponent $d(\\mathfrak{p}_i|p)$.\n\nLet's compute $v_3(d_K)$.\nWe consider the prime $p=3$. We write $n=12 = 3^1 \\cdot 4$. For the extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$, the ramification index $e$ of a prime above $p$ is given by $e = \\phi(p^k)$ where $p^k$ is the highest power of $p$ dividing $n$. Here, $k=1$, so $e = \\phi(3^1) = 2$.\nThe residue degree $f$ is the multiplicative order of $p$ modulo $m = n/p^k$. Here, $m=4$, so $f$ is the order of $3$ modulo $4$. Since $3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ and $3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we have $f=2$.\nThe number of primes $g$ lying over $p$ is given by $efg = [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\phi(12) = 4$. Thus, $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot g = 4$, which implies $g=1$. So, there is a unique prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ lying over $3$, and its factorization is $3\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathfrak{p}_3^2$.\nA prime $p$ is tamely ramified if its ramification index $e$ is not divisible by $p$. Here, $p=3$ and $e=2$, so $3 \\nmid 2$. The ramification is tame. For a tamely ramified prime $\\mathfrak{p}$, the different exponent is given by $d(\\mathfrak{p}|p) = e-1$.\nIn our case, $d(\\mathfrak{p}_3|3) = 2-1 = 1$.\nNow we compute $v_3(d_K)$:\n$$v_3(d_K) = f(\\mathfrak{p}_3|3) \\cdot d(\\mathfrak{p}_3|3) = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$$\n\nNext, we compute $v_2(d_K)$.\nWe consider the prime $p=2$. We write $n=12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$. The ramification index is $e = \\phi(2^2) = \\phi(4) = 2$.\nThe residue degree $f$ is the order of $p=2$ modulo $m = 3$. Since $2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ and $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, we have $f=2$.\nThe number of primes $g$ lying over $2$ is given by $efg = \\phi(12)=4$. Thus, $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot g = 4$, which implies $g=1$. There is a unique prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ lying over $2$, with factorization $2\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathfrak{p}_2^2$.\nA prime $p$ is wildly ramified if its ramification index $e$ is divisible by $p$.

The different satisfies the tower law: $\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} = \\mathfrak{D}_{K/L} \\cdot (\\mathfrak{D}_{L/\\mathbb{Q}}\\mathcal{O}_K)$.\nThe extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is ramified only at $p=2$. The ramification is wild with $2\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathfrak{q}^2$, where $\\mathfrak{q}=(1+i)$. The different $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/\\mathbb{Q}}$ is generated by $\\Phi'_4(\\zeta_4) = 2\\zeta_4 = 2i$. The $\\mathfrak{q}$-valuation of this ideal is $v_{\\mathfrak{q}}(2i) = v_{\\mathfrak{q}}(2) = 2$. So the $2$-part of $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/\\mathbb{Q}}$ is $\\mathfrak{q}^2$.\nThe extension $K/L$ is $L(\\zeta_3)/L$, which has relative degree $2$. The minimal polynomial of $\\zeta_3$ over $L$ is $X^2+X+1=0$, whose discriminant is $-3$. Ramification in $K/L$ can only occur at primes of $L$ lying over $3$. The prime $\\mathfrak{q}$ of $L$ lies over $2$, so it is unramified in $K/L$. This implies that the different $\\mathfrak{D}_{K/L}$ is not divisible by any prime of $K$ lying over $\\mathfrak{q}$.\nTherefore, the $\\mathfrak{p}_2$-valuation of $\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}$ comes entirely from the term $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/\\mathbb{Q}}\\mathcal{O}_K$:\n$$v_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}) = v_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/\\mathbb{Q}}\\mathcal{O}_K)$$\nTo evaluate this, we must know how $\\mathfrak{q}$ behaves in the extension $K/L$. The residue field of $\\mathfrak{q}$ is $\\mathcal{O}_L/\\mathfrak{q} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{F}_2$. The decomposition of $\\mathfrak{q}$ is determined by the factorization of the minimal polynomial $X^2+X+1$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{q}$ is inert in $K/L$, and the unique prime $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ over $2$ in $K$ is the extension of $\\mathfrak{q}$, i.e., $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = \\mathfrak{q}\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nNow we compute the valuation:\n$$v_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/\\mathbb{Q}}\\mathcal{O}_K) = v_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}((\\mathfrak{q}\\mathcal{O}_K)^2) = v_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}(\\mathfrak{p}_2^2) = 2$$\nSo, the different exponent is $d(\\mathfrak{p}_2|2) = 2$.\nFinally, we compute $v_2(d_K)$:\n$$v_2(d_K) = f(\\mathfrak{p}_2|2) \\cdot d(\\mathfrak{p}_2|2) = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$$\n\nWe have found $v_2(d_K)=4$ and $v_3(d_K)=2$. Since no other primes ramify, the absolute value of the discriminant is $|d_K| = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2$.\nThe sign of the discriminant is $(-1)^{s_2}$, where $s_2$ is the number of pairs of complex conjugate embeddings. The degree $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. Since $K$ is not a subfield of $\\mathbb{R}$ (as $\\zeta_{12} \\notin \\mathbb{R}$), all embeddings are complex. So, $r_1=0$ and $2s_2=4$, which means $s_2=2$. The sign is $(-1)^2=1$.\nThus, the discriminant is $d_K = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2^{4} \\cdot 3^{2}}\n$$", "id": "3012089"}]}
