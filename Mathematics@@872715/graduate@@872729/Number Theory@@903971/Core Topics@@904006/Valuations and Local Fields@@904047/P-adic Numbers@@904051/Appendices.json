The valuation $v_{p}(n)$ of an integer $n$ is defined as the exponent of the highest power of the prime $p$ that divides $n$. For a rational number $x = \\frac{m}{n}$, the valuation is defined as $v_{p}(x) = v_{p}(m) - v_{p}(n)$. This definition is consistent with the given property $v_{p}(a/b)=v_{p}(a)-v_{p}(b)$.\n\nWe find the $7$-adic valuation of $a$ and $b$. By inspecting the prime factorization of $a$, we see that the exponent of the prime $p=7$ is $3$. All other prime factors ($2$, $11$, $13$) are not equal to $7$. Therefore, the $7$-adic valuation of $a$ is:\n$$\nv_{7}(a) = v_{7}(2^{10} \\cdot 7^{3} \\cdot 11^{2} \\cdot 13) = 3\n$$\nSimilarly, by inspecting the prime factorization of $b$, we find the exponent of the prime $p=7$ is $5$. The other prime factors ($3$, $5$) are not equal to $7$. Therefore, the $7$-adic valuation of $b$ is:\n$$\nv_{7}(b) = v_{7}(3^{4} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7^{5}) = 5\n$$\nUsing the property $v_{p}(x/y) = v_{p}(x) - v_{p}(y)$, we compute the valuation of the fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$:\n$$\nv_{7}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = v_{7}(a) - v_{7}(b) = 3 - 5 = -2\n$$\nNext, we compute the $7$-adic absolute value. The definition provided is $|x|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(x)}$. For our case, $p=7$ and $x = \\frac{a}{b}$. We use the valuation we just calculated:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{a}{b}\\right|_{7} = 7^{-v_{7}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)} = 7^{-(-2)} = 7^{2} = 49\n$$\nNow, we interpret these results.\n\nIn terms of divisibility, the $p$-adic valuation measures how many factors of $p$ are present in a number.\n- $v_{7}(a) = 3$ signifies that $a$ is divisible by $7^3$ but not by $7^4$.\n- $v_{7}(b) = 5$ signifies that $b$ is divisible by $7^5$ but not by $7^6$.\n- When we form the quotient $\\frac{a}{b}$, the factors of $7$ cancel.\n$$\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{2^{10} \\cdot 7^{3} \\cdot 11^{2} \\cdot 13}{3^{4} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7^{5}} = \\frac{2^{10} \\cdot 11^{2} \\cdot 13}{3^{4} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7^{2}}\n$$\nThe result $v_{7}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = -2$ reflects that, after simplification, the denominator of the fraction contains a factor of $7^2$. A negative valuation indicates that the number is \"divisible by $p^{-1}$\", meaning $p$ is in its denominator.\n\nIn terms of the decomposition of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{\\times}$, there is a canonical isomorphism $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{\\times} \\cong p^{\\mathbb{Z}} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{\\times}$. Any non-zero $p$-adic number $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{\\times}$ can be uniquely written as $x = p^{n}u$, where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is an integer and $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{\\times}$ is a $p$-adic unit. A $p$-adic unit is an element of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ with a multiplicative inverse, which is equivalent to the condition $|u|_{p}=1$, or $v_{p}(u)=0$. The integer $n$ in this decomposition is precisely the $p$-adic valuation of $x$, so $n=v_{p}(x)$.\n\nFor our problem, $x = \\frac{a}{b}$ and $p=7$. We calculated $v_{7}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = -2$. Therefore, the exponent $n$ in the decomposition is $n = -2$. The number $\\frac{a}{b}$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{a}{b} = 7^{-2} \\cdot u\n$$\nwhere $u$ is a $7$-adic unit. We can find $u$ explicitly:\n$$\nu = \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot 7^{2} = \\left(\\frac{2^{10} \\cdot 7^{3} \\cdot 11^{2} \\cdot 13}{3^{4} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7^{5}}\\right) \\cdot 7^{2} = \\frac{2^{10} \\cdot 11^{2} \\cdot 13}{3^{4} \\cdot 5}\n$$\nThe valuation of $u$ is $v_{7}(u) = 0$, since its numerator and denominator are not divisible by $7$, confirming it is a $7$-adic unit. The result $v_{7}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = -2$ identifies the discrete part of the number in the decomposition of $\\mathbb{Q}_{7}^{\\times}$. The absolute value $|\\frac{a}{b}|_{7} = 49$ measures the \"size\" of the number in the $7$-adic metric, which is determined entirely by this discrete valuation part, since $|x|_{p} = |p^{n}u|_{p} = |p^{n}|_{p} |u|_{p} = p^{-n} \\cdot 1 = p^{-v_{p}(x)}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -2  49 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3028374"}, {"introduction": "Beyond arithmetic, the p-adic world hosts a rich theory of analysis, where familiar functions like the logarithm and exponential are defined by power series whose convergence is governed by the non-Archimedean metric.

The $5$-adic valuation of this term is:\n$$ v_5(T_n) = v_5(5^n) - v_5(n) = n - v_5(n) $$\nWe need to determine how many terms of the series must be summed to achieve the desired precision. We will sum the terms $T_n$ up to an index $k$ such that the remainder, $R_k = \\sum_{n=k+1}^\\infty T_n$, has a valuation of at least $4$. By the non-Archimedean property, $v_5(R_k) \\ge \\min_{n \\ge k+1} \\{v_5(T_n)\\}$.

Thus $n-v_5(n) = 5^k m - k \\ge 5^k - k \\ge 23 \\ge 5$.\nIn all cases for $n \\ge 6$, we find $v_5(T_n) \\ge 5$. This means the remainder $R_5 = \\sum_{n=6}^\\infty T_n$ has valuation $v_5(R_5) \\ge \\min_{n \\ge 6} v_5(T_n) \\ge 5$.\nTherefore, $\\log_5(1+5) \\equiv \\sum_{n=1}^5 T_n \\pmod{5^5}$, which is more than the required precision.

The congruence becomes $12A \\equiv 410 \\pmod{625}$.\nWe need the inverse of $12$ modulo $625$. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm for $625$ and $12$:\n$625 = 52 \\times 12 + 1$. Thus $1 = 625 - 52 \\times 12$, which implies $12^{-1} \\equiv -52 \\equiv 573 \\pmod{625}$.\nNow we solve for $A$:\n$$ A \\equiv 410 \\times 12^{-1} \\equiv 410 \\times 573 \\pmod{625} $$\n$410 \\times 573 = 234930$.

This requires $3n + S_5(n) \\ge 20$.\n-   For $n=6 = 1 \\cdot 5^1 + 1 \\cdot 5^0$, $S_5(6) = 1+1=2$. $3(6)+2 = 20$. So $v_5(U_6) = 20/4 = 5$.\n-   For $n6$, the function $f(n)=3n+S_5(n)$ is strictly increasing.

The field extension $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)/\\mathbb{Q}_3$ has degree equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial $f(x)$, which is $2$.\nA standard theorem in algebraic number theory states that an extension generated by a root of an Eisenstein polynomial is totally ramified. Since $f(x)$ is an Eisenstein polynomial of degree $2$, the extension $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)/\\mathbb{Q}_3$ is a totally ramified quadratic extension. The ramification index is $e=2$ and the residue field degree is $f=1$.\n\nTo compute $|\\alpha|_3$, we use the defining relation $f(\\alpha)=0$, which is $\\alpha^2 - 3 = 0$, or $\\alpha^2=3$. We take the $3$-adic absolute value of both sides:\n$$|\\alpha^2|_3 = |3|_3$$\nUsing the property $|x^n|_p = |x|_p^n$ and the normalization $|3|_3 = 3^{-1}$, we get:\n$$|\\alpha|_3^2 = 3^{-1}$$\nTaking the square root of this real-valued equation, we find:\n$$|\\alpha|_3 = (3^{-1})^{1/2} = 3^{-1/2}$$\nIn terms of valuations, this corresponds to $v_3(\\alpha) = 1/2$. The fact that the valuation group of $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)$ contains a non-integer value ($1/2$) confirms that the extension is ramified.\n\n**Part 2: Krasner bound $\\delta(\\alpha)$**\n\nThe Krasner bound $\\delta(\\alpha)$ is the minimum $p$-adic distance from $\\alpha$ to any of its Galois conjugates other than itself. The polynomial $f(x)=x^2-3$ has degree $2$, so $\\alpha$ has exactly one other conjugate. Since $f(x)$ has coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}_3$, if $\\alpha$ is a root, then so is $-\\alpha$, because $(-\\alpha)^2 - 3 = \\alpha^2 - 3 = 0$. As $\\alpha^2=3 \\neq 0$, we have $\\alpha \\neq 0$, so $\\alpha \\neq -\\alpha$. Thus, the unique non-trivial conjugate of $\\alpha$ is $\\sigma(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$.\n\nThe Krasner bound is therefore:\n$$\\delta(\\alpha) = |\\sigma(\\alpha) - \\alpha|_3 = |-\\alpha - \\alpha|_3 = |-2\\alpha|_3$$\nUsing the properties of the non-Archimedean absolute value:\n$$\\delta(\\alpha) = |-1|_3 \\cdot |2|_3 \\cdot |\\alpha|_3$$\nWe evaluate each term:\n-   $|-1|_3 = 1$.\n-   Since $3$ is a prime and $3 \\nmid 2$, $2$ is a $3$-adic unit. Therefore, $|2|_3 = 3^{-v_3(2)} = 3^0 = 1$.\n-   From Part 1, we computed $|\\alpha|_3 = 3^{-1/2}$.\n\nSubstituting these values, we get the Krasner bound:\n$$\\delta(\\alpha) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3^{-1/2} = 3^{-1/2}$$\n\n**Part 3: Compute $|\\beta-\\alpha|_3$ and comparison**\n\nWe are given $\\beta = 0 \\in \\mathbb{Q}_3$. We compute the distance $|\\beta-\\alpha|_3$:\n$$|\\beta-\\alpha|_3 = |0-\\alpha|_3 = |-\\alpha|_3 = |-1|_3 \\cdot |\\alpha|_3 = 1 \\cdot |\\alpha|_3 = |\\alpha|_3$$\nUsing our result from Part 1, this is:\n$$|\\beta-\\alpha|_3 = 3^{-1/2}$$\nComparing this with the Krasner bound from Part 2, we see that:\n$$|\\beta-\\alpha|_3 = \\delta(\\alpha) = 3^{-1/2}$$\nThe problem points out that the Krasner bound is \"not strictly satisfied\". This refers to Krasner's Lemma, which states:\n*If $\\alpha \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_p$ is algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, and $\\beta \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_p$ satisfies $|\\beta-\\alpha|_p  \\delta(\\alpha)$, then $\\mathbb{Q}_p(\\alpha) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}_p(\\beta)$.*\n\nIn our case, with $p=3$, we have found that $|\\beta-\\alpha|_3 = \\delta(\\alpha)$. The strict inequality required by Krasner's Lemma is not satisfied. Therefore, the conclusion of the lemma, $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}_3(\\beta)$, is not guaranteed.\n\nWe can check the extensions directly to see that they differ.\n-   The extension generated by $\\beta$ is $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\beta) = \\mathbb{Q}_3(0) = \\mathbb{Q}_3$. This is the base field itself, a degree $1$ extension.\n-   The extension generated by $\\alpha$ is $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)$, which, as established in Part 1, is a degree $2$ extension over $\\mathbb{Q}_3$.\n\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)$ is a proper extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_3$, it is manifest that $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}_3(\\beta)$ and, in particular, $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha) \\not\\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}_3(\\beta)$. This situation demonstrates that the strict inequality in Krasner's Lemma is a crucial condition. When the distance from $\\beta$ to $\\alpha$ is exactly the minimal distance from $\\alpha$ to its conjugates, it is possible for the conclusion of the lemma to fail, as it does in this case.\n\nThe final answer is the value of $|\\beta-\\alpha|_3$.\n$$|\\beta-\\alpha|_3 = 3^{-1/2}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3^{-1/2}}$$", "id": "3020585"}]}
