Let $p$ be a fixed prime number.\n\nFirst, we establish whether $(s_{N})$ is a Cauchy sequence with respect to each absolute value. A sequence $(x_{n})$ is Cauchy if for any $\\varepsilon  0$, there exists an integer $K$ such that for all $m, n \\geq K$, the distance $d(x_{m}, x_{n})  \\varepsilon$.\n\n**Analysis with the usual Archimedean absolute value $|\\cdot|$**\nLet $m, N$ be integers with $m  N$. The distance between $s_{m}$ and $s_{N}$ is given by:\n$$|s_{m} - s_{N}| = \\left| \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{m} p^{n}\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{N} p^{n}\\right) \\right| = \\left| \\sum_{n=N+1}^{m} p^{n} \\right|$$\nSince $p$ is a prime number, $p \\geq 2$. Thus, all terms $p^{n}$ are positive. The absolute value can be removed:\n$$|s_{m} - s_{N}| = \\sum_{n=N+1}^{m} p^{n} = p^{N+1} + p^{N+2} + \\dots + p^{m}$$\nTo test the Cauchy condition, we must be able to make this distance arbitrarily small by choosing $N$ large enough. However, the sum is always greater than or equal to its first term:\n$$|s_{m} - s_{N}| \\geq p^{N+1}$$\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, the term $p^{N+1}$ grows without bound since $p \\geq 2$. For instance, if we choose $\\varepsilon = 1$, there is no $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $m  N$, $|s_{m} - s_{N}|  1$, because $p^{N+1} \\geq 2^{N+1} \\geq 2^{1} = 2  1$ for all $N \\geq 0$. Therefore, the sequence $(s_{N})$ is **not** a Cauchy sequence with respect to the usual absolute value $|\\cdot|$.\n\nConsequently, the series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^{n}$ does not converge in $\\mathbb{R}$. The question of absolute summability concerns the convergence of $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} |p^{n}|$. Since $p  0$, $|p^{n}| = p^{n}$. The series is $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^{n}$, which is a geometric series with ratio $r=p$. Since $p \\geq 2$, the condition for convergence $|r|1$ is not met. Thus, the series is **not** absolutely summable.\n\n**Analysis with the $p$-adic absolute value $|\\cdot|_{p}$**\nAgain, let $m, N$ be integers with $m  N$. The distance is now $|s_{m} - s_{N}|_{p}$.\n$$s_{m} - s_{N} = \\sum_{n=N+1}^{m} p^{n} = p^{N+1} + p^{N+2} + \\dots + p^{m} = p^{N+1} (1 + p + \\dots + p^{m-N-1})$$\nUsing the multiplicative property of the $p$-adic absolute value, $|x y|_{p} = |x|_{p} |y|_{p}$:\n$$|s_{m} - s_{N}|_{p} = |p^{N+1}|_{p} |1 + p + \\dots + p^{m-N-1}|_{p}$$\nFrom the definition $|a|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(a)}$, we have $|p^{N+1}|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(p^{N+1})} = p^{-(N+1)}$.\nNow, let $K = 1 + p + \\dots + p^{m-N-1}$. $K$ is an integer. To find $|K|_{p}$, we need its $p$-adic valuation, $v_{p}(K)$. Notice that $K \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, which means that $K$ is not divisible by $p$. Thus, $v_{p}(K) = 0$.\nThis implies $|K|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(K)} = p^{-0} = 1$.\nSubstituting these results back, we get:\n$$|s_{m} - s_{N}|_{p} = p^{-(N+1)} \\cdot 1 = p^{-(N+1)}$$\nTo check the Cauchy condition, for any $\\varepsilon  0$, we need to find an integer $K$ such that for all $m  N \\geq K$, $|s_{m} - s_{N}|_{p}  \\varepsilon$. This inequality becomes $p^{-(N+1)}  \\varepsilon$. As $N \\to \\infty$, $N+1 \\to \\infty$, so $-(N+1) \\to -\\infty$, and $p^{-(N+1)} \\to 0$. Thus, for any given $\\varepsilon  0$, we can always find a sufficiently large $K$ that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the sequence $(s_{N})$ is **a Cauchy sequence** with respect to the $p$-adic absolute value $|\\cdot|_{p}$.\n\n**Finding the limit in $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$**\nThe problem states that $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ is the completion of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with respect to $|\\cdot|_{p}$. Since $(s_{N})$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(\\mathbb{Q}, |\\cdot|_{p})$, it must converge to a limit in $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. Let this limit be $S = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} s_{N}$. The problem asks to identify this limit as an element of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWe use the well-known formula for the partial sum of a geometric series:\n$$s_{N} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} p^{n} = \\frac{1 - p^{N+1}}{1 - p}$$\nWe can now take the limit as $N \\to \\infty$ in the $p$-adic metric.\n$$S = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} s_{N} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1 - p^{N+1}}{1 - p}$$\nSince the algebraic operations are continuous with respect to the metric, we can write:\n$$S = \\frac{\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} (1 - p^{N+1})}{\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} (1 - p)} = \\frac{1 - \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{N+1}}{1 - p}$$\nWe must evaluate $\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{N+1}$ in $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. A sequence $(a_n)$ converges to $L$ if $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} |a_n - L|_p = 0$. Here, we test for convergence to $0$:\n$$\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} |p^{N+1} - 0|_{p} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} |p^{N+1}|_{p} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{-(N+1)} = 0$$\nThus, $\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{N+1} = 0$ in the $p$-adic metric.\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{1 - 0}{1 - p} = \\frac{1}{1-p}$$\nThis limit is a rational number, so it lies in $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$.
