A residue class $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ is a root of $f(x)$ modulo $3$ if $f(a) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.

Since there are no roots of $f(x)$ modulo $3$, it follows immediately that there are no simple roots of $f(x)$ modulo $3$.\n\nThe absence of a root modulo $3$ is a critical obstruction to the existence of a root in $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. To rigorously justify this, we relate any hypothetical root in $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ to its image under the canonical reduction homomorphism $\\pi: \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a root $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_3$ such that $f(\\alpha)=0$. By definition of a root, this means $\\alpha^2+1=0$ in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\nThe map $\\pi$ is a ring homomorphism. Applying this homomorphism to the equation $f(\\alpha)=0$ gives:\n$$\\pi(\\alpha^2+1) = \\pi(0)$$\nBecause $\\pi$ is a homomorphism, it preserves addition and multiplication. The coefficients of $f(x)$ are integers, which are elements of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, and $\\pi(c)=c \\pmod 3$ for any integer $c$.

This is a direct application of the constructive principle underlying Hensel's Lemma for polynomial factorization.\n\nFirst, we verify the provided information. The polynomial is $f(x)=x^{3}+3x^{2}+2x+6$. The prime is $p=7$. The proposed factors modulo $7$ are $g(x)=x-4$ and $h(x)=x^{2}+2$. All coefficients are interpreted as elements of $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$, so $x-4$ is equivalent to $x+3$.\nLet us compute the product $g(x)h(x)$ in $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})[x]$:\n$$g(x)h(x) = (x-4)(x^{2}+2) = x^{3}-4x^{2}+2x-8$$\nReducing the coefficients modulo $7$:\n$$x^{3}-4x^{2}+2x-8 \\equiv x^{3}+3x^{2}+2x-1 \\equiv x^{3}+3x^{2}+2x+6 \\pmod{7}$$\nThis is identical to $f(x) \\pmod{7}$. The factorization $f(x) \\equiv g(x)h(x) \\pmod{7}$ is correct.\n\nNext, we verify that $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are relatively prime in $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})[x]$. The polynomial $g(x)=x-4$ has a single root $x=4$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$. To check for common factors, we evaluate $h(x)$ at this root:\n$$h(4) = 4^{2}+2 = 16+2 = 18 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$$\nSince $h(4) \\neq 0$, $g(x)$ does not divide $h(x)$. As $g(x)$ is a linear polynomial, its only non-trivial factors are associates of itself. Thus, $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ share no common factors, and their greatest common divisor is $1$. They are indeed relatively prime.\n\nThe problem asks for the algebraic condition that the correction polynomials $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ must satisfy, and for their explicit computation. We are given the lifted factorization form modulo $7^2=49$:\n$$G(x)H(x) \\equiv f(x) \\pmod{49}$$\nwhere $G(x) = g(x)+7u(x)$ and $H(x) = h(x)+7v(x)$. The polynomials $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ have coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$, and satisfy degree constraints $\\deg u  \\deg g = 1$ and $\\deg v  \\deg h = 2$.\n\nWe substitute the forms of $G(x)$ and $H(x)$ into the congruence:\n$$(g(x)+7u(x))(h(x)+7v(x)) \\equiv f(x) \\pmod{49}$$\nExpanding the left side, we obtain:\n$$g(x)h(x) + 7g(x)v(x) + 7h(x)u(x) + 49u(x)v(x) \\equiv f(x) \\pmod{49}$$\nThe term $49u(x)v(x)$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $49$, so it can be omitted:\n$$g(x)h(x) + 7(h(x)u(x) + g(x)v(x)) \\equiv f(x) \\pmod{49}$$\nThis can be rearranged to isolate the correction term:\n$$7(h(x)u(x) + g(x)v(x)) \\equiv f(x) - g(x)h(x) \\pmod{49}$$\nThe initial condition states $f(x) \\equiv g(x)h(x) \\pmod{7}$, which implies that the polynomial $f(x) - g(x)h(x)$ has all its coefficients divisible by $7$. Let us define a polynomial $c(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that:\n$$f(x) - g(x)h(x) = 7c(x)$$\nSubstituting this into the congruence gives:\n$$7(h(x)u(x) + g(x)v(x)) \\equiv 7c(x) \\pmod{49}$$\nDividing the entire congruence by $7$, which is a valid operation in integer arithmetic that changes the modulus from $49$ to $7$, we arrive at the central algebraic condition that $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ must satisfy in $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})[x]$:\n$$h(x)u(x) + g(x)v(x) \\equiv c(x) \\pmod{7}$$\nThis is the required condition derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we must compute $c(x)$. We work with polynomials in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ for this step:\n$$f(x) = x^{3}+3x^{2}+2x+6$$\n$$g(x)h(x) = (x-4)(x^{2}+2) = x^{3}-4x^{2}+2x-8$$\nThe difference is:\n$$f(x) - g(x)h(x) = (x^{3}+3x^{2}+2x+6) - (x^{3}-4x^{2}+2x-8) = 7x^{2}+14$$\nThus, $7c(x) = 7(x^2+2)$, which implies $c(x) = x^{2}+2$.\nReducing $c(x)$ modulo $7$, we find $c(x) \\equiv x^{2}+2 \\pmod{7}$. We observe that this is precisely the polynomial $h(x)$ in $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})[x]$.\n\nSo, the congruence we need to solve for $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ in $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})[x]$ is:\n$$h(x)u(x) + g(x)v(x) \\equiv h(x) \\pmod{7}$$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$g(x)v(x) \\equiv h(x) - h(x)u(x) \\pmod{7}$$\n$$g(x)v(x) \\equiv h(x)(1 - u(x)) \\pmod{7}$$\nWe have already established that $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are relatively prime in the unique factorization domain $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})[x]$. By Euclid's lemma for polynomials, if $g(x)$ divides the product $h(x)(1-u(x))$ and is coprime to $h(x)$, then $g(x)$ must divide $(1-u(x))$.\nThus, there must exist a polynomial $q_1(x) \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})[x]$ such that:\n$$1 - u(x) = q_1(x)g(x)$$\nSimilarly, $h(x)$ must divide $g(x)v(x)$, and being coprime to $g(x)$, it must divide $v(x)$. So, there exists a polynomial $q_2(x) \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})[x]$ such that:\n$$v(x) = q_2(x)h(x)$$\nNow we apply the degree constraints. We are given $\\deg v  \\deg h$. From the relation $v(x) = q_2(x)h(x)$, we have $\\deg v = \\deg q_2 + \\deg h$. For the degree constraint to hold, we must have $\\deg q_2 + \\deg h  \\deg h$, which implies $\\deg q_2  0$. The only polynomial with a negative degree is the zero polynomial. Therefore, $q_2(x) = 0$, which in turn implies $v(x) = 0 \\cdot h(x) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $v(x)=0$ back into the congruence $g(x)v(x) \\equiv h(x)(1 - u(x)) \\pmod{7}$:\n$$g(x) \\cdot 0 \\equiv h(x)(1-u(x)) \\pmod{7}$$\n$$0 \\equiv h(x)(1-u(x)) \\pmod{7}$$\nSince $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})[x]$ is an integral domain and $h(x) = x^2+2$ is not the zero polynomial, we must have:\n$$1 - u(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$$\nThis implies $u(x) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nFinally, we check the degree constraint for $u(x)$. The polynomial $u(x)=1$ is a constant, so its degree is $0$. The constraint is $\\deg u  \\deg g = 1$. Since $0  1$, this condition is satisfied.\nThe explicit correction polynomials are $u(x)=1$ and $v(x)=0$ in $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})[x]$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3015650"}, {"introduction": "The standard form of Hensel's Lemma requires the derivative at the approximate root to be a $p$-adic unit, i.e., non-zero modulo $p$.

We are given the singular condition, $f(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$ and $f'(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, which in terms of the $p$-adic valuation $v_p$ is $v_p(f(a_0)) \\ge 1$ and $v_p(f'(a_0)) \\ge 1$. We seek sufficient conditions on the valuations of $f(a_0)$ and $f'(a_0)$ to guarantee the existence of a true root $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ near $a_0$.\n\nCase A: $v_p(f'(a_0))$ is finite.\nLet $j=v_p(f(a_0))$ and $k=v_p(f'(a_0))$, with $j \\ge 1$ and $k \\ge 1$. A standard approach is to use a $p$-adic version of the Newton-Raphson method to construct a sequence of better approximations:\n$$ a_{n+1} = a_n - \\frac{f(a_n)}{f'(a_n)} $$\nLet's analyze the first step, from $a_0$ to $a_1$. Let $\\delta_0 = a_1 - a_0 = -f(a_0)/f'(a_0)$.\nThe valuation of this correction term is $v_p(\\delta_0) = v_p(f(a_0)) - v_p(f'(a_0)) = j - k$.\nFor the sequence $(a_n)$ to converge, we require $v_p(a_{n+1}-a_n) \\to \\infty$, so we should at least have $j-k > 0$, i.e., $j>k$.\nLet's examine the derivative at $a_1 = a_0 + \\delta_0$. By Taylor's theorem for polynomials:\n$$ f'(a_1) = f'(a_0+\\delta_0) = f'(a_0) + f''(a_0)\\delta_0 + \\frac{f'''(a_0)}{2}\\delta_0^2 + \\dots $$\nThe valuation of the second term is $v_p(f''(a_0)\\delta_0) = v_p(f''(a_0)) + v_p(\\delta_0) \\ge 0 + j-k$. To ensure that the valuation of the derivative remains stable, $v_p(f'(a_1))=v_p(f'(a_0))=k$, we need the subsequent terms in the expansion to have a strictly larger valuation than the first term. This means we require $v_p(f''(a_0)\\delta_0) > k$, which implies $j-k > k$, or $j > 2k$.\nNow let's examine $f(a_1)$:\n$$ f(a_1) = f(a_0+\\delta_0) = f(a_0) + f'(a_0)\\delta_0 + \\frac{f''(a_0)}{2}\\delta_0^2 + \\dots $$\nBy construction of $\\delta_0$, the first two terms cancel: $f(a_0) + f'(a_0)(-\\frac{f(a_0)}{f'(a_0)}) = 0$.

Thus, $v_p(f(a_1)) \\ge 2v_p(\\delta_0) = 2(j-k)$. For the error $f(a_n)$ to decrease (in the $p$-adic sense, for its valuation to increase), we need $v_p(f(a_1)) > v_p(f(a_0))$, which is $2(j-k) > j$, or $j > 2k$.\nThis reveals the sufficient condition: if $v_p(f(a_0)) > 2v_p(f'(a_0))$, the Newton-Raphson sequence converges to a root $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$. This root will be unique within the disk $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p : |z-a_0|_p \\le p^{-(j-k)}\\}$. A stronger inequality provides a more precise and uniquely determined lift.\n\nCase B: $f'(a_0) = 0$.\nThe Newton-Raphson method is undefined. We use a different approach based on Taylor's theorem. Let $x$ be a potential root near $a_0$. Write $x=a_0+y$.\n$$ f(x) = f(a_0+y) = f(a_0) + f'(a_0)y + \\frac{f''(a_0)}{2}y^2 + \\frac{f'''(a_0)}{6}y^3 + \\dots $$\nSince $f'(a_0)=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ f(x) = f(a_0) + \\frac{f''(a_0)}{2}y^2 + \\dots $$\nWe want to solve $f(x)=0$. If we can neglect the higher-order terms in $y$, we are led to solve approximately $f(a_0) + \\frac{f''(a_0)}{2}y^2 = 0$, which gives $y^2 = -\\frac{2f(a_0)}{f''(a_0)}$.\nThis suggests a sufficient condition: if $v_p(f''(a_0))=0$ (i.e., $f''(a_0)$ is a $p$-adic unit) and the quantity $d = -2f(a_0)/f''(a_0)$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, then a solution exists. An element $d \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ if it can be written as $d = u \\cdot p^{2m}$ for some integer $m \\ge 0$ and $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$ is a $p$-adic unit whose reduction modulo $p$ is a quadratic residue. If this holds, standard Hensel's lemma guarantees that $y^2=d$ has a solution (in fact, two, $\\pm \\sqrt{d}$) in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. The lifts are then $x = a_0 \\pm \\sqrt{d}$. In general, this provides two distinct lifts, so uniqueness is not expected.

We test the approximate solution $a_0=0$, which satisfies $a_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$.\n- First, we verify the initial congruences.\n  $f(a_0) = f(0) = -98 = -2 \\cdot 7^2$. Since $f(0)$ is a multiple of $7$, we have $f(0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$.\n- Next, we check the derivative. $f'(x)=2x$.\n  $f'(a_0) = f'(0) = 0$. Thus, $f'(0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$.\nThe conditions of the problem are met. Since $f'(0)=0$, we are in Case B from Part 1. We compute the second derivative: $f''(x)=2$.\nSo, $f''(a_0)=f''(0)=2$. This is a $7$-adic unit, as $v_7(2)=0$.\nThe condition for lifting a root requires us to check if $d = -2f(0)/f''(0)$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$.\n$$ d = \\frac{-2(-98)}{2} = 98 = 2 \\cdot 49 = 2 \\cdot 7^2 $$\nHere, in the form $u \\cdot p^{2m}$, we have $u=2$, $p=7$, and $m=1$. For $d$ to be a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$, the unit part $u=2$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_7^\\times$. This is true if and only if $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $7$. We check the squares modulo $7$: $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2=9 \\equiv 2$.\nSince $3^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$, $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $7$. Therefore, by the standard (non-singular) Hensel's lemma applied to $g(y)=y^2-2$, there exist two solutions for $y^2=2$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$. Let these solutions be denoted by $\\pm \\sqrt{2}$.\nThe roots $x^*$ of $f(x)=0$ are then $x^* = a_0 \\pm \\sqrt{d} = 0 \\pm \\sqrt{98} = \\pm \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 7^2} = \\pm 7\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7$ be a solution to $y^2=2$. Then $x^*=7y$ is a solution to $f(x)=x^2-98=0$. This is the requested parametrization.\nThe two possible residue classes of $y$ modulo $7$ are the solutions to $y^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$. As computed above, these are $y \\equiv 3 \\pmod 7$ and $y \\equiv -3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7$.\n\n3) Computation of $v_7\\big(f'(x^{\\ast})\\big)$.\n\nWe have found that any lifted root $x^*$ takes the form $x^*=7y$ for some $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7$ satisfying $y^2=2$.\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x)=2x$. At a lifted root $x^*$, its value is:\n$$ f'(x^*) = 2x^* = 2(7y) = 14y $$\nWe need to compute the $7$-adic valuation of this expression:\n$$ v_7\\big(f'(x^*)\\big) = v_7(14y) $$\nUsing the property $v_p(ab)=v_p(a)+v_p(b)$ of the valuation, we have:\n$$ v_7(14y) = v_7(14) + v_7(y) $$\nWe compute each term separately.\n- For $v_7(14)$: we write $14=2 \\cdot 7$. So, $v_7(14) = v_7(2) + v_7(7)$. Since $7$ is not a factor of $2$, $v_7(2)=0$. By definition, $v_7(7)=1$. Thus, $v_7(14)=0+1=1$.\n- For $v_7(y)$: $y$ is a solution to $y^2=2$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$. As we found in Part 2, the possible residue classes for $y$ modulo $7$ are $3$ and $4$. In either case, $y \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$, which means $y$ is not divisible by $7$. By definition, this means $y$ is a $7$-adic unit ($y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7^\\times$), and its valuation is $v_7(y)=0$.\nCombining these results, we get:\n$$ v_7\\big(f'(x^*)\\big) = 1 + 0 = 1 $$\nThis result holds for any of the lifted roots $x^*$ satisfying $x^* \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3015677"}]}
