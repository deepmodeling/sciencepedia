It requests the derivation of the Minkowski bound for a cubic number field $K$ with signature $(r_1, r_2) = (1, 1)$, which is a well-defined and scientifically grounded task.\n\nLet $K$ be a cubic number field with signature $(r_1, r_2) = (1, 1)$. The degree of the extension is $n=r_1+2r_2 = 1+2(1)=3$. Let $\\mathcal{O}_K$ be its ring of integers and $d_K$ its discriminant. The Minkowski embedding is a homomorphism $\\iota: K \\to \\mathbb{R}^{r_1} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{r_2}$, which in this case is $\\iota: K \\to \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{C}$. We identify the target space $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{C}$ with $\\mathbb{R}^3$ via the map $(x, u+iv) \\mapsto (x, u, v)$. The standard Euclidean volume element on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is $dx\\,du\\,dv$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{C}$ be an ideal class in the class group of $K$. To find an integral ideal $J \\in \\mathcal{C}$ with a small norm, we begin by choosing a fractional ideal $I \\in \\mathcal{C}^{-1}$. Then for any $\\alpha \\in I$, the ideal $(\\alpha)I^{-1}$ is an integral ideal belonging to the class $\\mathcal{C}$. Our strategy is to find a non-zero element $\\alpha \\in I$ such that its norm $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|$ is small, which will impose a bound on the norm of the corresponding integral ideal $J = (\\alpha)I^{-1}$. For our derivation, we may choose $I$ to be an integral ideal without loss of generality.\n\nThe image $\\iota(I)$ is a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ whose covolume is given by $\\text{covol}(\\iota(I)) = 2^{-r_2} N(I) \\sqrt{|d_K|}$. For our case, this is $\\text{covol}(\\iota(I)) = 2^{-1} N(I) \\sqrt{|d_K|}$.\n\nWe employ Minkowski's convex body theorem. We must construct a suitable centrally symmetric convex set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$. A standard choice, which connects the geometry to the arithmetic norm via the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean (AGM) inequality, is the set $S_t$ defined for a parameter $t0$:\n$$S_t = \\{ (x, z) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{C} \\mid |x| + 2|z| \\le t \\}$$\nThis set is centrally symmetric since if $(x, z) \\in S_t$, then $|-x| + 2|-z| = |x| + 2|z| \\le t$, so $(-x, -z) \\in S_t$. It is convex due to the properties of the absolute value (triangle inequality).\n\nNext, we calculate the volume of $S_t$. Identifying $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{C}$ with $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (coordinates $(x,u,v)$ where $z=u+iv$), the condition becomes $|x| + 2\\sqrt{u^2+v^2} \\le t$.\n$$ \\text{Vol}(S_t) = \\iiint_{|x| + 2\\sqrt{u^2+v^2} \\le t} dx \\, du \\, dv $$\nWe can integrate with respect to $x$ first, for which $|x| \\le t - 2\\sqrt{u^2+v^2}$.

Thus:\n$$ |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)| \\le \\left(\\frac{t}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{t^3}{27} $$\nSubstituting the value of $t^3$:\n$$ |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)| \\le \\frac{1}{27} \\left( \\frac{24}{\\pi} N(I) \\sqrt{|d_K|} \\right) = \\frac{8}{9\\pi} N(I) \\sqrt{|d_K|} $$\nThe ideal $J = (\\alpha)I^{-1}$ is integral and belongs to the class $\\mathcal{C}$. Its norm is $N(J) = N((\\alpha))N(I)^{-1} = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|/N(I)$. Substituting this into the inequality:\n$$ N(J)N(I) \\le \\frac{8}{9\\pi} N(I) \\sqrt{|d_K|} $$\nDividing by $N(I)$ (which is non-zero), we obtain the bound on the norm of $J$:\n$$ N(J) \\le \\frac{8}{9\\pi} \\sqrt{|d_K|} $$\nThis shows that every ideal class $\\mathcal{C}$ contains an integral ideal $J$ whose norm is bounded by $M_K = \\frac{8}{9\\pi}\\sqrt{|d_K|}$.\n\nThe problem also asks for an explanation of the origin of the multiplicative factor associated with $r_2=1$. The general Minkowski bound is $M_K = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\sqrt{|d_K|}$. For our case, this is $\\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^1 \\frac{3!}{3^3} \\sqrt{|d_K|} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\frac{6}{27} \\sqrt{|d_K|} = \\frac{8}{9\\pi}\\sqrt{|d_K|}$, which matches our result. The factor in question is $\\frac{4}{\\pi}$. Its origin lies in the interplay between three components of the derivation for each complex embedding:\n1.  **Volume of the Convex Body**: The presence of a complex embedding $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ means we integrate over a two-dimensional real space. The change of variables from Cartesian $(u,v)$ to polar $(r,\\theta)$ coordinates for $z$ introduces a factor of $2\\pi$ from the angular integration $\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta$. The term $2|z|$ in the body's definition $S_t$ means the radius of integration is effectively scaled by $1/2$, leading to a scaling of the volume (area) by $(1/2)^2=1/4$. This combines with other factors in the volume integral to produce an overall coefficient of $(\\pi/2)^{r_2}$ in the general volume formula $\\text{Vol}(S_t) = 2^{r_1} (\\pi/2)^{r_2} t^n/n!$. For $r_2=1$, this introduces a factor of $\\pi/2$.\n2.  **Covolume of the Lattice**: The formula for the covolume of $\\iota(I)$ contains a factor of $2^{-r_2}$. This is a standard normalization in the theory. For $r_2=1$, this is a factor of $1/2$.\n3.  **Minkowski's Theorem Threshold**: The theorem's threshold is $2^n$. With $n=r_1+2r_2$, this is $2^{r_1+2r_2}$.\n\nThe bound on $t^n$ is proportional to $\\frac{2^n \\cdot 2^{-r_2}}{\\text{volume coefficient from complex part}}$. For each unit of $r_2$, this ratio becomes $\\frac{2^{2r_2} \\cdot 2^{-r_2}}{(\\pi/2)^{r_2}} = \\frac{2^{r_2}}{(\\pi/2)^{r_2}} = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2}$. Specifically, for $r_2=1$, the condition $\\text{Vol}(S_t) \\ge 2^3 \\text{covol}(\\iota(I))$ involves $2^3=8$ on the right, which combines with the covolume factor $2^{-1}$ to give a net factor of $4$. The volume $\\text{Vol}(S_t) = (\\pi/6)t^3$ has the factor $\\pi$. The condition $t^3 \\propto 4/\\pi$ results from this, which propagates to the final bound $M_K$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8}{9\\pi}\\sqrt{|d_{K}|}}$$", "id": "3017779"}, {"introduction": "With the formula for the Minkowski bound in hand, we can now witness its power in action.

Any such ideal $\\mathfrak{b}$ has a prime factorization $\\mathfrak{b} = \\prod \\mathfrak{p}_i^{e_i}$. Since the norm is multiplicative, $N(\\mathfrak{b}) = \\prod N(\\mathfrak{p}_i)^{e_i}$. This implies that each prime factor $\\mathfrak{p}_i$ must satisfy $N(\\mathfrak{p}_i) \\le N(\\mathfrak{b}) \\le M_K$.\nTherefore, the class group $Cl(K)$ is generated by the classes of prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $N(\\mathfrak{p}) \\le M_K$.\n\nFor the specific field $K$ in question, the Minkowski bound is $M_K = \\frac{14}{9} \\approx 1.556$.\nWe need to find the prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}$ such that $N(\\mathfrak{p}) \\le \\frac{14}{9}$. The norm of any non-zero ideal is an integer, so we are looking for ideals with norm $1$.

The above result implies that the class group is generated by the classes of prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}$ whose norms satisfy $N(\\mathfrak{p}) \\le \\lfloor M_K \\rfloor = 2$. If $\\mathfrak{a}$ is an ideal with $N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\le 2$, then its prime factorization $\\mathfrak{a} = \\prod \\mathfrak{p}_i^{e_i}$ implies $N(\\mathfrak{a}) = \\prod N(\\mathfrak{p}_i)^{e_i}$. Since $N(\\mathfrak{p}_i) \\ge 2$ for any prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_i$, an ideal with norm $N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ must either be the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ itself (if $N(\\mathfrak{a})=1$) or a prime ideal of norm $2$ (if $N(\\mathfrak{a})=2$).\n\nAn ideal of norm $1$ can only be $\\mathcal{O}_K = (1)$, which is principal and represents the identity element of the class group. To find any non-trivial generators of the class group, we must investigate the existence and principality of prime ideals of norm $2$. This concludes the first part of the reasoning: to find $h_K$, it is sufficient to analyze the ideals of norm at most $2$.\n\n### Step 2: Factorization of the Rational Prime 2\n\nTo determine if there are any prime ideals of norm $2$, we must study the factorization of the rational prime $p=2$ in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$. A prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ has norm $N(\\mathfrak{p}) = p^f$ for some integer $f \\ge 1$, where $p$ is the unique rational prime lying below $\\mathfrak{p}$ (i.e., $p\\mathbb{Z} = \\mathfrak{p} \\cap \\mathbb{Z}$). Thus, a prime ideal of norm $2$ must lie above the rational prime $2$.\n\nWe are given that $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ where $\\alpha = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{29}}{2}$. We find the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$:\n$$ 2\\alpha = 1+\\sqrt{29} \\implies 2\\alpha - 1 = \\sqrt{29} $$\n$$ (2\\alpha - 1)^2 = 29 \\implies 4\\alpha^2 - 4\\alpha + 1 = 29 \\implies 4\\alpha^2 - 4\\alpha - 28 = 0 $$\n$$ \\alpha^2 - \\alpha - 7 = 0 $$\nThe minimal polynomial is $f(x) = x^2 - x - 7$. The discriminant of this polynomial is $(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-7) = 1+28=29$, which matches the field discriminant $d_K=29$. This confirms that $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]=1$, so we can apply Dedekind's factorization theorem.\n\nAccording to this theorem, the factorization of the ideal $(2)=2\\mathcal{O}_K$ mirrors the factorization of the polynomial $f(x)$ modulo $2$. We consider $f(x)$ in the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_2[x]$:\n$$ f(x) \\equiv x^2 - x - 7 \\pmod 2 $$\n$$ f(x) \\equiv x^2 + x + 1 \\pmod 2 $$\nTo check for irreducibility of this quadratic polynomial over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, we test for roots in $\\mathbb{F}_2 = \\{0, 1\\}$:\n$$ f(0) \\equiv 0^2 + 0 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2 $$\n$$ f(1) \\equiv 1^2 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2 $$\nSince $f(x)$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_2$, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nBy Dedekind's theorem, since the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $2$, the ideal $(2)$ is a prime ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. This is the case where the prime $2$ is said to be inert in the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe single prime ideal lying above $2$ is thus $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (2)$. The inertia degree $f$ is the degree of the irreducible factor polynomial, so $f=2$. The norm of this prime ideal is:\n$$ N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = N((2)) = 2^f = 2^2 = 4 $$\nThis result shows that there are no prime ideals in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $2$. The only prime ideal above $2$ has norm $4$.\n\n### Step 3: Computation of the Class Number $h_K$\n\nFrom Step 1, we established that the class group $\\text{Cl}(K)$ is generated by the classes of prime ideals with norm at most $2$. This means we need to consider ideals with norm $1$ and $2$.\n\n- **Norm 1**: The only integral ideal with norm $1$ is $\\mathcal{O}_K = (1)$. This ideal is principal by definition and represents the trivial class in the class group.\n\n- **Norm 2**: We seek ideals $\\mathfrak{a}$ with $N(\\mathfrak{a})=2$. Since $2$ is a prime number, any such ideal must be a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$. In Step 2, we analyzed the prime ideals lying above the rational prime $2$ and found that there is only one such prime ideal, namely $(2)$ itself, and its norm is $4$. We therefore concluded that there are no prime ideals of norm $2$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Consequently, there are no integral ideals of norm $2$.\n\nEvery ideal class in $\\text{Cl}(K)$ must contain an integral ideal representative with norm at most $2$. The set of such ideals is $\\{\\mathcal{O}_K\\}$. Since the only such representative is the principal ideal $\\mathcal{O}_K$, every ideal class must be the principal class.\nThis implies that the class group is trivial: $\\text{Cl}(K) = \\{[\\mathcal{O}_K]\\}$.\nThe class number, $h_K$, is the order of the class group. Therefore, the class number of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{29})$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3017778"}]}
