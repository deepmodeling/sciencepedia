This bound is to be determined using a specific line of reasoning based on first principles and should depend only on the Lebesgue measure of the disk, $\\mu(S)$.\n\nThe problem is a specific instance of Blichfeldt's theorem in the geometry of numbers. We will follow the requested steps to derive and justify the bound.\n\nFirst, we compute the Lebesgue measure of the set $S$. Since $S$ is a closed disk in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ of radius $R$, its area (Lebesgue measure) is given by:\n$$\n\\mu(S) = \\pi R^2\n$$\n\nNext, we establish the lower bound. Let $L = \\mathbb{Z}^2$ be the integer lattice and $F = [0,1)^2$ be the half-open fundamental domain. The plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be tiled by translates of $F$ by lattice vectors, i.e., $\\mathbb{R}^2 = \\bigsqcup_{v \\in L} (v+F)$. This tiling allows us to identify the torus $\\mathbb{T}^2 = \\mathbb{R}^2/L$ with $F$. Let $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to F$ be the canonical projection map, defined by $\\pi(x) = x - v$ where $v \\in L$ is the unique lattice vector such that $x-v \\in F$.\n\nFor any measurable set $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$, consider the function $g_A: F \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ defined as:\n$$\ng_A(p) = \\#\\{v \\in L : p+v \\in A\\}\n$$\nThis function counts, for each point $p$ in the fundamental domain, how many points in the fiber $\\{p+v\\}_{v \\in L}$ are contained in the set $A$. Essentially, it counts the number of \"layers\" of $A$ that stack up over the point $p$ when $A$ is \"folded\" into the fundamental domain $F$.\n\nWe can compute the integral of $g_A$ over $F$. Using the definition of $g_A$ and swapping the order of summation and integration (justified by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, as the indicator function is non-negative):\n$$\n\\int_F g_A(p) \\,d\\mu(p) = \\int_F \\sum_{v \\in L} \\mathbf{1}_A(p+v) \\,d\\mu(p) = \\sum_{v \\in L} \\int_F \\mathbf{1}_A(p+v) \\,d\\mu(p)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}_A$ is the indicator function of the set $A$. For each term in the sum, we perform a change of variables $u = p+v$. The differential is $du=dp$ as the Jacobian of the translation is $1$. The domain of integration changes from $F$ to $v+F$.\n$$\n\\int_F \\mathbf{1}_A(p+v) \\,d\\mu(p) = \\int_{v+F} \\mathbf{1}_A(u) \\,d\\mu(u) = \\mu(A \\cap (v+F))\n$$\nSumming over all $v \\in L$ yields:\n$$\n\\int_F g_A(p) \\,d\\mu(p) = \\sum_{v \\in L} \\mu(A \\cap (v+F)) = \\mu\\left(\\bigcup_{v \\in L} (A \\cap (v+F))\\right) = \\mu(A)\n$$\nThe last equality holds because the sets $v+F$ form a partition of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nApplying this result to our set $S$, we have $\\int_F g_S(p) \\,d\\mu(p) = \\mu(S)$.\nLet $m$ be an integer. The core of the argument, which is a continuous version of the pigeonhole principle, is as follows: If $\\mu(S)  m-1$, then there must exist a point $p_0 \\in F$ such that $g_S(p_0) \\ge m$.\nTo prove this, we argue by contradiction. Assume that $g_S(p) \\le m-1$ for all $p \\in F$. Since $g_S(p)$ is integer-valued, this is equivalent to $g_S(p)  m$. Integrating this inequality over $F$:\n$$\n\\int_F g_S(p) \\,d\\mu(p) \\le \\int_F (m-1) \\,d\\mu(p) = (m-1)\\mu(F)\n$$\nSince $\\mu(F) = \\mu([0,1)^2) = 1$, we get $\\int_F g_S(p) \\,d\\mu(p) \\le m-1$.\nThis contradicts our premise that $\\mu(S) = \\int_F g_S(p) \\,d\\mu(p)  m-1$.\nTherefore, if $\\mu(S)  m-1$, there must exist a point $p_0 \\in F$ where $g_S(p_0) \\ge m$.\n\nBy definition of $g_S$, the existence of such a $p_0$ implies that there are at least $m$ distinct lattice vectors, say $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_m \\in L$, such that $p_0+v_i \\in S$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$. Let us define the points $x_i = p_0+v_i$. All these $m$ points belong to $S$.\n\nNow, we must find a translate of $S$ that contains $m$ lattice points. Consider the translation of $S$ by the vector $t = -x_1$. The translated set is $S+t = S-x_1$.\nFor each $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$, the point $x_i$ is in $S$, so the point $x_i - x_1$ must be in the translated set $S-x_1$.\nLet's examine these points:\n$$\nx_i - x_1 = (p_0+v_i) - (p_0+v_1) = v_i - v_1\n$$\nSince $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_m$ are distinct lattice vectors, the differences $v_i - v_1$ are also $m$ distinct lattice vectors (one of which is $v_1-v_1=0$).\nThus, we have found $m$ distinct lattice points $\\{v_1-v_1, v_2-v_1, \\dots, v_m-v_1\\}$ inside the translated set $S-x_1$. This demonstrates that $\\#((S-x_1) \\cap L) \\ge m$.\n\nThe question is, what is the largest integer $m$ for which this guarantee holds? We can guarantee $m$ points as long as $\\mu(S)  m-1$. This is equivalent to $m  \\mu(S)+1$. The largest integer $m$ satisfying this condition is $\\lceil \\mu(S) \\rceil$. Let's verify:\n- If $\\mu(S)$ is not an integer, let $\\mu(S) = I+f$ where $I$ is an integer and $0f1$. Then $\\lceil \\mu(S) \\rceil = I+1$. We must check if $\\mu(S)  (I+1)-1 = I$. This is true since $I+f  I$.\n- If $\\mu(S)$ is an integer, let $\\mu(S)=I$. Then $\\lceil \\mu(S) \\rceil = I$. We must check if $\\mu(S)  I-1$. This is true since $I  I-1$ for any integer $I$.\nSo, we can always guarantee the existence of a translate containing at least $m = \\lceil \\mu(S) \\rceil$ lattice points.\n\nTherefore, a lower bound for the maximum number of points is $\\lceil \\mu(S) \\rceil$.\n$$\n\\max_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}}\\#\\big((S+t)\\cap L\\big) \\ge \\lceil \\mu(S) \\rceil\n$$\n\nFinally, we must justify that this bound is sharp among all bounds that depend only on the measure $\\mu(S)$. To do this, we must show that for any given value $V0$, we can construct a set $A_V$ with $\\mu(A_V) = V$ such that no translate of $A_V$ contains more than $\\lceil V \\rceil$ lattice points. This proves that no function of the measure can provide a universally better lower bound.\n\nLet $V  0$ be a given measure, and let $k = \\lceil V \\rceil$. We know that $k-1  V \\le k$.\nConsider the set $A_V = [0, 1) \\times [0, V)$. The measure is $\\mu(A_V) = 1 \\cdot V = V$.\nLet's count the number of lattice points in an arbitrary translate $A_V+t$ for $t=(t_x, t_y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n$$\nA_V+t = [t_x, t_x+1) \\times [t_y, t_y+V)\n$$\nA lattice point $(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ is in $A_V+t$ if and only if $t_x \\le m  t_x+1$ and $t_y \\le n  t_y+V$.\nThe first condition, $m \\in [t_x, t_x+1)$, allows for at most one integer value for $m$, since the interval has length $1$.\nThe second condition, $n \\in [t_y, t_y+V)$, constrains $n$ to an interval of length $V$. The number of integers in such an interval is at most $\\lceil V \\rceil$.\nThus, the total number of lattice points in $A_V+t$ is at most $1 \\cdot \\lceil V \\rceil = \\lceil V \\rceil$.\nSince we have constructed, for any $V0$, a set of measure $V$ for which the maximum number of included lattice points in any translate is $\\lceil V \\rceil$, no larger lower bound that depends only on the measure can be established.\nThe bound $m = \\lceil \\mu(S) \\rceil$ is therefore sharp.\n\nSubstituting $\\mu(S) = \\pi R^2$, the sharp lower bound is $\\lceil \\pi R^2 \\rceil$.\n\nThe required expression for $m(R)$ is this lower bound.\n$$\nm(R) = \\lceil \\pi R^2 \\rceil\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\lceil \\pi R^2 \\rceil}$$", "id": "3009289"}, {"introduction": "A central application of Blichfeldt's principle is to answer questions about geometric constraints, such as \"how large must a set be to guarantee it contains a certain lattice point configuration?\".

Blichfeldt's principle directly implies the condition stated in the problem. If $\\mu(S_\\lambda) > \\text{covolume}(L)$, then by the principle, there exist $s_1, s_2 \\in S_\\lambda$ with $s_1 \\neq s_2$ such that their difference $v = s_1 - s_2$ is a non-zero vector in $L$.\nLet us choose the translation vector $t = -s_2$. The translated set is $t+S_\\lambda$. Consider the images of $s_1$ and $s_2$ under this translation:\n- $t+s_1 = -s_2 + s_1 = v$\n- $t+s_2 = -s_2 + s_2 = 0$\nBoth $0$ and $v$ are points in the lattice $L=\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Since $s_1 \\neq s_2$, $v \\neq 0$, so these are two distinct lattice points. Both points belong to the translated set $t+S_\\lambda$. Therefore, the condition from Blichfeldt's principle is sufficient to guarantee the existence of such a translate.\n\nThe lattice is $L=\\mathbb{Z}^n$, whose fundamental domain is the unit hypercube $[0,1)^n$. The covolume of $L$ is $\\mu([0,1)^n) = 1$.\nThe condition from Blichfeldt's principle is thus $\\mu(S_\\lambda) > 1$.\n\nUsing the result from Part 1, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda^n}{n!} > 1 $$\nSolving for $\\lambda$ (since $\\lambda>0$):\n$$ \\lambda^n > n! $$\n$$ \\lambda > (n!)^{1/n} $$\n\nThis result shows that for any $\\lambda > (n!)^{1/n}$, the property stated in the problem holds.
