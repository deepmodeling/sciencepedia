The derivation must proceed from Minkowski's convex body theorem and the change-of-variables formula for volumes.\n\nFirst, we establish the general existence criterion for a nonzero integer vector $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ satisfying a system of inequalities $|L_i(x)| \\le b_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$. The linear forms $L_i(x)$ can be represented by a matrix $A$ such that $L(x) = Ax$, where $L=(L_1, \\dots, L_n)^T$.\n\nMinkowski's convex body theorem states that if a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is convex, centrally symmetric with respect to the origin, and has a volume $\\mathrm{Vol}(S)$ satisfying $\\mathrm{Vol}(S) > 2^{n}$, it must contain at least one nonzero integer point $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. If $S$ is additionally compact (closed and bounded), the condition can be relaxed to $\\mathrm{Vol}(S) \\ge 2^{n}$.\n\nThe set in this problem is defined as $S = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} : |L_{i}(x)| \\le b_{i} \\text{ for } i=1,2,3\\}$. This set is a generalized parallelepiped. It is convex because it is an intersection of half-spaces. It is centrally symmetric because if a vector $x$ satisfies $|L_i(x)| \\le b_i$, then the vector $-x$ also satisfies $|L_i(-x)| = |-L_i(x)| = |L_i(x)| \\le b_i$. Because the inequalities are not strict $(\\le)$ and the bounds $b_i$ are finite, the set $S$ is closed and bounded in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, and therefore compact. Thus, we can use the version of Minkowski's theorem for compact sets, which guarantees a nonzero integer point if $\\mathrm{Vol}(S) \\ge 2^{3}$.\n\nTo apply this criterion, we must compute the volume of $S$. We use the change-of-variables formula for integration. Let the linear transformation be $y = L(x) = Ax$. Provided that the matrix $A$ is invertible, we can write $x = A^{-1}y$. The volume element $d^{3}x$ is related to $d^{3}y$ by the absolute value of the Jacobian determinant of the transformation $x(y) = A^{-1}y$. The Jacobian matrix is $A^{-1}$, so its determinant is $\\det(A^{-1}) = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)}$. Therefore, $d^{3}x = |\\det(A^{-1})| d^{3}y = \\frac{1}{|\\det(A)|} d^{3}y$.\n\nThe set $S$ in $x$-space is the preimage of a rectangular box $B$ in $y$-space, where $B = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} : |y_1| \\le b_1, |y_2| \\le b_2, |y_3| \\le b_3 \\}$. The volume of $S$ is then:\n$$ \\mathrm{Vol}(S) = \\int_{S} d^{3}x = \\int_{B} \\frac{1}{|\\det(A)|} d^{3}y = \\frac{1}{|\\det(A)|} \\mathrm{Vol}(B). $$\nThe volume of the box $B$ is the product of the lengths of its sides, which are $2b_1$, $2b_2$, and $2b_3$.\n$$ \\mathrm{Vol}(B) = (2b_1)(2b_2)(2b_3) = 8 b_1 b_2 b_3 = 2^{3} b_1 b_2 b_3. $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the volume of $S$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Vol}(S) = \\frac{2^{3} b_1 b_2 b_3}{|\\det(A)|}. $$\nThe condition from Minkowski's theorem, $\\mathrm{Vol}(S) \\ge 2^{3}$, becomes:\n$$ \\frac{2^{3} b_1 b_2 b_3}{|\\det(A)|} \\ge 2^{3}. $$\nDividing by $2^{3}$ yields the general existence criterion for a nonzero integer solution in $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$:\n$$ \\frac{b_1 b_2 b_3}{|\\det(A)|} \\ge 1. $$\nNow, we apply this result to the given data. Here, $n=3$. The coefficient matrix is $A = \\mathrm{diag}(2, 3, \\pi)$. Its determinant is $\\det(A) = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\pi = 6\\pi$. The absolute value is $|\\det(A)| = 6\\pi$. The bounds are $b_1 = 2$, $b_2 = 3$, and $b_3 = 2\\pi$. The product of the bounds is $b_1 b_2 b_3 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2\\pi = 12\\pi$.\n\nWe check the existence criterion:\n$$ \\frac{b_1 b_2 b_3}{|\\det(A)|} = \\frac{12\\pi}{6\\pi} = 2. $$\nSince $2 \\ge 1$, the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the existence of a nonzero integer vector $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ satisfying the inequalities is guaranteed.\n\nNext, we construct such a vector. The inequalities are:\n$|L_1(x)| = |2x_1| \\le 2 \\implies |x_1| \\le 1$.\n$|L_2(x)| = |3x_2| \\le 3 \\implies |x_2| \\le 1$.\n$|L_3(x)| = |\\pi x_3| \\le 2\\pi \\implies |x_3| \\le 2$.\n\nSince $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ must be an integer vector, its components must be integers satisfying these bounds:\n$x_1 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n$x_2 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n$x_3 \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$.\n\nWe need a nonzero vector. Many simple options exist. For instance, consider the vector $x = (1, 0, 0)$. This is a nonzero integer vector. We verify if it lies in $S$:\n$|L_1(x)| = |2 \\cdot 1| = 2$. This satisfies $2 \\le 2$.\n$|L_2(x)| = |3 \\cdot 0| = 0$. This satisfies $0 \\le 3$.\n$|L_3(x)| = |\\pi \\cdot 0| = 0$. This satisfies $0 \\le 2\\pi$.\nAll conditions are met, so $x = (1, 0, 0)$ is a valid nonzero integer vector in $S$.\n\nFinally, we compute the exact value of the ratio $R = \\frac{b_1 b_2 b_3}{|\\det(A)|}$. This is precisely the value computed during the existence check.\n$$ R = \\frac{b_1 b_2 b_3}{|\\det(A)|} = \\frac{(2)(3)(2\\pi)}{|6\\pi|} = \\frac{12\\pi}{6\\pi} = 2. $$\nThe exact value of the ratio $R$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3017960"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond straightforward computation, this exercise focuses on building geometric intuition for the theorem.

The rectangle $R$ is bounded by four lines: $y_1 = 3$, $y_1 = -3$, $y_2 = 4$, and $y_2 = -4$. A fundamental property of an invertible linear transformation is that it maps lines to lines. Consequently, its inverse transformation, $T^{-1}$, also maps lines to lines. The boundary of $S$ is the preimage of the boundary of $R$.\nThe preimages of the boundary lines of $R$ are:\n1. The line $y_1 = 3$ is mapped from the line $L_1(\\mathbf{x}) = 4x_1 + x_2 = 3$ in the $\\mathbf{x}$-plane.\n2.

A quadrilateral enclosed by two pairs of parallel lines is, by definition, a parallelogram.

This demonstrates that the condition $\\prod c_i \\ge \\Delta$ is met with equality. Thus, the setup realizes the equality case of the condition in Minkowski's theorem for linear forms.\n\nTo connect this to the volume of the region $P$, we use the change of variables from $(m,n)$ to $(y_1, y_2)$.

The inequalities become:\n$|k_1| \\le \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$\n$|k_2| \\le \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$\n\nFor an integer $k$, $|k| \\le \\sqrt{2}$ implies that $k$ can only be $-1$, $0$, or $1$. So, we must have $k_1, k_2 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\nTo find the integer solutions $(m,n)$, we solve the system of equations for $m$ and $n$ in terms of $k_1$ and $k_2$:\n$m+n = k_1$\n$m-n = k_2$\nAdding the equations gives $2m = k_1+k_2$, so $m = \\frac{k_1+k_2}{2}$.\nSubtracting the second from the first gives $2n = k_1-k_2$, so $n = \\frac{k_1-k_2}{2}$.\n\nFor $m$ and $n$ to be integers, the sums $k_1+k_2$ and $k_1-k_2$ must both be even.

This is the zero vector, which we must exclude.\n\n2.
