{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey into Dirichlet L-functions often begins by building upon the familiar landscape of the Riemann zeta function, $\\zeta(s)$.

Then, using the analyticity of any auxiliary factors you identify, compute the residue of $L(s,\\chi_{0})$ at $s=1$. Express your final answer exactly; no rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed question in analytic number theory based on standard, correct definitions and established mathematical facts.\n\nThe problem asks for two main results: first, an expression for the Dirichlet $L$-function $L(s, \\chi_0)$ associated with the principal character modulo $4$ in terms of the Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$, and second, the residue of $L(s, \\chi_0)$ at the point $s=1$.\n\nLet's begin by analyzing the given character $\\chi_0$. It is the principal Dirichlet character modulo $4$, defined as:\n$$\n\\chi_0(n) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if } \\gcd(n,4)=1 \\\\\n0  \\text{if } \\gcd(n,4) \\neq 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe condition $\\gcd(n,4)=1$ is true if and only if $n$ is not divisible by $2$, i.e., $n$ is an odd integer. The condition $\\gcd(n,4) \\neq 1$ is true if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2$, i.e., $n$ is an even integer. Therefore, the character can be described more simply as:\n$$\n\\chi_0(n) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\\\\n0  \\text{if } n \\text{ is even}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe Dirichlet $L$-function is defined for $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  1$ by the series $L(s, \\chi_0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\chi_0(n)n^{-s}$. Using our characterization of $\\chi_0$, this sum only includes terms where $n$ is odd:\n$$ L(s, \\chi_0) = \\sum_{n \\text{ odd}, n \\ge 1} \\frac{1}{n^s} $$\nTo relate this to the Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$, we shall use the Euler product representations. For $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  1$, the Riemann zeta function is given by the Euler product over all prime numbers $p$:\n$$ \\zeta(s) = \\prod_{p \\text{ prime}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p^s}\\right)^{-1} $$\nSince the character $\\chi_0$ is completely multiplicative, its $L$-function also has an Euler product representation for $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  1$:\n$$ L(s, \\chi_0) = \\prod_{p \\text{ prime}} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\chi_0(p)}{p^s}\\right)^{-1} $$\nWe need to evaluate $\\chi_0(p)$ for prime numbers $p$. According to the definition of $\\chi_0$:\n- If $p=2$, then $p$ is even, so $\\chi_0(2)=0$.\n- If $p$ is any other prime, then $p$ is odd, so $\\chi_0(p)=1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the Euler product for $L(s, \\chi_0)$:\n$$ L(s, \\chi_0) = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\chi_0(2)}{2^s}\\right)^{-1} \\prod_{p \\text{ odd prime}} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\chi_0(p)}{p^s}\\right)^{-1} $$\n$$ L(s, \\chi_0) = \\left(1 - \\frac{0}{2^s}\\right)^{-1} \\prod_{p \\text{ odd prime}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p^s}\\right)^{-1} $$\n$$ L(s, \\chi_0) = (1-0)^{-1} \\prod_{p \\text{ odd prime}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p^s}\\right)^{-1} = \\prod_{p \\text{ odd prime}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p^s}\\right)^{-1} $$\nNow, we can relate this to the Euler product for $\\zeta(s)$ by separating the term for $p=2$ in the product for $\\zeta(s)$:\n$$ \\zeta(s) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2^s}\\right)^{-1} \\prod_{p \\text{ odd prime}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p^s}\\right)^{-1} $$\nBy comparing the two expressions, we see that the product over odd primes is a common factor.\n$$ \\prod_{p \\text{ odd prime}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p^s}\\right)^{-1} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2^s}\\right) \\zeta(s) $$\nTherefore, the explicit expression for $L(s, \\chi_0)$ in terms of $\\zeta(s)$ for $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  1$ is:\n$$ L(s, \\chi_0) = \\left(1 - 2^{-s}\\right)\\zeta(s) $$\nThis equation provides the meromorphic continuation of $L(s, \\chi_0)$ to the entire complex plane, inheriting the analytic properties of $\\zeta(s)$ and the factor $(1 - 2^{-s})$.\n\nNext, we compute the residue of $L(s, \\chi_0)$ at $s=1$. The problem states that $\\zeta(s)$ is meromorphic with a simple pole at $s=1$ with residue $1$. The residue of $\\zeta(s)$ at $s=1$ is thus given as:\n$$ \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} \\zeta(s) = 1 $$\nWe need to find $\\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} L(s, \\chi_0)$. Using the expression we derived:\n$$ \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} L(s, \\chi_0) = \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} \\left[ \\left(1 - 2^{-s}\\right)\\zeta(s) \\right] $$\nLet's define a function $f(s) = 1 - 2^{-s}$. This function is an entire function, meaning it is analytic on the entire complex plane. If a function $g(s)$ has a simple pole at $s=a$, and $f(s)$ is analytic at $s=a$, the residue of their product is given by the rule:\n$$ \\operatorname{Res}_{s=a} [f(s) g(s)] = f(a) \\cdot \\operatorname{Res}_{s=a} g(s) $$\nIn our case, $g(s) = \\zeta(s)$ and the pole is at $a=1$. The function $f(s)=1-2^{-s}$ is analytic at $s=1$. Applying the rule, we get:\n$$ \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} L(s, \\chi_0) = \\left(1 - 2^{-1}\\right) \\cdot \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} \\zeta(s) $$\nWe evaluate the factor at $s=1$:\n$$ 1 - 2^{-1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} L(s, \\chi_0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe residue of $L(s, \\chi_0)$ at $s=1$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. This result is consistent with the general theory of Dirichlet $L$-functions, which states that for a modulus $q$, the $L$-function $L(s, \\chi)$ is entire unless $\\chi$ is the principal character, in which case it has a simple pole at $s=1$ with residue $\\frac{\\phi(q)}{q}$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.

A character is primitive modulo $q$ if it does not factor through a character modulo any proper divisor of $q$. If $\\chi$ modulo $q$ is induced from a primitive character $\\psi$ modulo $q_{0}\\mid q$, then for $\\gcd(n,q)=1$ one has $\\chi(n)=\\psi(n)$ and otherwise $\\chi(n)=0$. The conductor $q_{0}$ of $\\chi$ is the minimal such $q_{0}$.\n\nFor $\\operatorname{Re}(s)1$, the Dirichlet $L$-function $L(s,\\chi)$ is defined by the series\n$$\nL(s,\\chi)\\;=\\;\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\chi(n)}{n^{s}},\n$$\nand admits the Euler product\n$$\nL(s,\\chi)\\;=\\;\\prod_{p} \\left(1-\\frac{\\chi(p)}{p^{s}}\\right)^{-1},\n$$\nwhere the product ranges over all primes $p$, with the convention that if $\\chi(p)=0$ (i.e., $p\\mid q$), then the factor equals $1$ and contributes trivially. The same holds for $L(s,\\psi)$ with modulus $q_{0}$.\n\nStep 1: Determination of the conductor $q_{0}$.\n\nBy construction, $\\chi$ modulo $12$ is induced from $\\psi$ modulo $3$ in the sense that for $\\gcd(n,12)=1$ we set $\\chi(n)=\\psi(n)$ and for $\\gcd(n,12)1$ we set $\\chi(n)=0$. Therefore, $\\chi$ is induced from the primitive character $\\psi$ modulo $3$. We must verify that no smaller modulus $q_{0}'$ with $q_{0}'\\mid 12$ induces $\\chi$.\n\nThe proper divisors of $12$ are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $6$.\n\n- If $q_{0}'=1$, then the only character modulo $1$ is the trivial character, which on integers coprime to $12$ would be identically $1$. But $\\chi(5)=\\psi(5)$. Since $5\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$, we have $\\psi(5)=-1$, hence $\\chi(5)=-1\\neq 1$. Thus $q_{0}'\\neq 1$.\n\n- If $q_{0}'=2$, the only character modulo $2$ is the principal character on odd integers, taking the value $1$ on all odd integers. Again $\\chi(5)=-1$, so $q_{0}'\\neq 2$.\n\n- If $q_{0}'=3$, there exists a primitive nontrivial character modulo $3$, namely $\\psi$. Our $\\chi$ clearly coincides with $\\psi$ on all integers coprime to $12$ (and thus coprime to $3$) and vanishes otherwise. Hence $q_{0}=3$ is admissible.\n\n- For $q_{0}'=4$ or $6$, if $\\chi$ were induced from a primitive character modulo $4$ or $6$, its restriction to integers coprime to $12$ would be periodic modulo $4$ or $6$ respectively and arise from those moduli. However, on integers coprime to $12$, $\\chi(n)=\\psi(n)$ depends only on $n\\bmod 3$. There is no nontrivial primitive character modulo $4$ whose restriction to units modulo $12$ matches $\\psi$, because the unit groups modulo $4$ and modulo $12$ have different structures with respect to residue classes modulo $3$, and in particular the value at $n\\equiv 5\\bmod 12$ would force a sign inconsistent with any such induction from $4$. Similarly for modulus $6$, any candidate would necessarily factor through modulus $3$ due to the $3$-part, and the $2$-part would force values $1$ on all odd integers, contradicting $\\chi(5)=-1$. Therefore, neither $4$ nor $6$ is a valid conductor.\n\nConsequently, the minimal modulus from which $\\chi$ is induced is $q_{0}=3$.\n\nStep 2: Euler factor modification relating $L(s,\\chi)$ and $L(s,\\psi)$.\n\nLet $q=12$ and $q_{0}=3$.

For primes $p\\mid q$, there are two cases:\n\n- If $p\\mid q_{0}$ as well, then both $\\chi(p)=0$ and $\\psi(p)=0$, so each of the two Euler factors is $(1-0\\cdot p^{-s})^{-1}=1$; thus they match and contribute trivially.\n\n- If $p\\mid q$ but $p\\nmid q_{0}$, then $\\chi(p)=0$ (since $p\\mid q$) but $\\psi(p)\\neq 0$ (since $p\\nmid q_{0}$).
