The Burgess method for bounding $|S(N,H)|$ proceeds by applying the $r$-fold differencing and Hölder inequality for a fixed integer $r \\geq 2$, together with the Weil bound for character sums over finite fields. A standard consequence of these steps is that there exists a parameter $U$ with $1 \\leq U \\leq H$ for which one obtains a bound of the schematic form\n$$\n|S(N,H)| \\ll H^{\\,1 - 1/r}\\,\\Big( q^{\\,1/(2r)}\\,U \\;+\\; q^{\\,1/(2r^{2})}\\,U^{-1} \\Big),\n$$\nwhere the factor $H^{\\,1 - 1/r}$ arises from the $r$-th moment via Hölder inequality, and the $q$-powers reflect inputs of square-root cancellation from the Weil bound and the distribution of the $r$-fold differencing variables.

This strongly suggests a method that balances the two terms, such as the arithmetic mean–geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality. Although the problem mentions a contextual constraint $1 \\leq U \\leq H$, the instruction to treat $U$ as a positive real variable for optimization, combined with the goal of \"compressing\" the terms, implies we should find the unconstrained global minimum of $f(U)$ for $U  0$. The minimum for the constrained problem might occur at a boundary and would not involve \"compressing\" the two terms into one.\n\nWe will use the AM-GM inequality, which states that for any non-negative real numbers $x$ and $y$, their arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to their geometric mean: $\\frac{x+y}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{xy}$, with equality holding if and only if $x=y$.\n\nLet $x = q^{\\frac{1}{2r}}\\,U$ and $y = q^{\\frac{1}{2r^2}}\\,U^{-1}$.

Validation against Criteria:**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in analytic number theory. Dirichlet characters, character sums, the Pólya–Vinogradov inequality, and Burgess's bound are all standard, well-established concepts. The value $q=10^7=2^7 \\cdot 5^7$ is not cube-free, for which the constants in Burgess's bound may have additional dependencies (e.g., on the number of prime factors).

Verdict:**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Calculation of Bounds\n\nLet $S(H) = \\sum_{n=1}^{H} \\chi(n)$ be the character sum for a primitive nonprincipal character $\\chi$ modulo $q$. We are given $H=10^3$ and $q=10^7$.\n\n**2.1. Trivial Bound**\nThe most straightforward bound is obtained by applying the triangle inequality:\n$$|S(H)| = \\left|\\sum_{n=1}^{H} \\chi(n)\\right| \\leq \\sum_{n=1}^{H} |\\chi(n)|$$\nFor any integer $n$, the value of a Dirichlet character $\\chi(n)$ is either a root of unity or $0$.

Pólya–Vinogradov Bound**\nThe \"standard completion technique\" mentioned in the problem refers to writing the character $\\chi(n)$ in terms of its finite Fourier series and summing over $n$. This procedure leads to the Pólya–Vinogradov inequality. For a primitive character $\\chi$ modulo $q$, the bound is:\n$$|S(H)| \\leq C \\sqrt{q} \\ln(q)$$\nwhere $C$ is some absolute constant. The problem instructs us to normalize all implied constants and logarithmic losses to $1$. Under this normalization, the bound becomes:\n$$|S(H)|_{\\text{P-V}} \\approx q^{1/2}$$\nSubstituting $q=10^7$:\n$$|S(H)|_{\\text{P-V}} \\approx (10^7)^{1/2} = 10^{3.5} = 10^3 \\sqrt{10} \\approx 1000 \\times 3.16227... \\approx 3162.28$$\nThis bound is independent of the sum length $H$ and is non-trivial (i.e., better than the trivial bound $H$) only for $H \\gtrsim \\sqrt{q}$. In our case, $H=10^3  \\sqrt{10^7} \\approx 3162$, so the trivial bound is stronger.\n\n**2.3. Burgess's Bound**\nBurgess's method provides a significant improvement for character sums where the length $H$ is in an intermediate range, typically $q^{1/4}  H  q^{1/2}$. The general form of the Burgess bound for a primitive character $\\chi$ modulo $q$ is:\n$$|S(H)| \\ll_{\\epsilon, r} H^{1 - 1/r} q^{(r+1)/(4r^2) + \\epsilon}$$\nfor any integer $r \\ge 1$. The term $\\epsilon$ can often be replaced by logarithmic factors. As per the problem's normalization rule, we set all implied constants, logarithmic factors, and any $\\epsilon$ terms to $1$. The bound is therefore taken to be:\n$$|S(H)|_{\\text{Burgess}} \\approx H^{1 - 1/r} q^{(r+1)/(4r^2)}$$\nThe problem asks for the \"exponent pair\" that encodes the dependence on $H$ and $q$. This refers to the exponents in the bound. For a general $r$, this pair is $(1 - \\frac{1}{r}, \\frac{r+1}{4r^2})$.\n\nThe problem specifies using the parameter $r=3$. Substituting $r=3$ into the exponents:\n- Exponent of $H$: $1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n- Exponent of $q$: $\\frac{3+1}{4(3^2)} = \\frac{4}{36} = \\frac{1}{9}$\n\nThus, the exponent pair is $(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{1}{9})$, and the specific Burgess bound to be used is:\n$$|S(H)|_{\\text{Burgess}} \\approx H^{2/3} q^{1/9}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for $H = 10^3$ and $q = 10^7$:\n$$|S(H)|_{\\text{Burgess}} \\approx (10^3)^{2/3} (10^7)^{1/9}$$\nWe compute the powers of $10$:\n$$(10^3)^{2/3} = 10^{3 \\times (2/3)} = 10^2$$\n$$(10^7)^{1/9} = 10^{7/9}$$\nCombining these results:\n$$|S(H)|_{\\text{Burgess}} \\approx 10^2 \\cdot 10^{7/9} = 10^{2 + 7/9} = 10^{18/9 + 7/9} = 10^{25/9}$$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we compute $10^{25/9}$:\n$$10^{25/9} \\approx 10^{2.7777...} \\approx 599.48425$$\nThe problem requires this value rounded to $4$ significant figures.
