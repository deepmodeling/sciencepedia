It states that if two disjoint hypersurfaces evolve by the same geometric law, they will remain disjoint.\nWe are given that at $t=0$, $M_0$ is strictly contained in the region bounded by $S_0$. We want to show that $M_t$ remains strictly contained in the region bounded by $S_t$ for $t0$.\nThe argument is by contradiction. Assume there is a first time $t_0  0$ where the two hypersurfaces touch at a point $p$. At this point of first contact:\n1.  The hypersurfaces $M_{t_0}$ and $S_{t_0}$ must be tangent.\n2.  Their outward unit normal vectors must coincide: $\\nu_M(p, t_0) = \\nu_S(p, t_0)$.\n3.  Since $M_t$ was contained in $S_t$ for $t  t_0$, the curvature of the inner surface $M_{t_0}$ must be greater than or equal to the curvature of the outer surface $S_{t_0}$ at $p$. This means the mean curvature of the inner surface is greater than or equal to that of the outer one: $H_M(p, t_0) \\geq H_S(p, t_0)$.\n\nNow, we compare the normal velocities of the two surfaces at $(p, t_0)$.\nThe velocity of $M_t$ is $V_M(p, t_0) = H_M(p, t_0) + c$.\nThe velocity of $S_t$ is $V_S(p, t_0) = H_S(p, t_0) + c$.\nUsing the curvature inequality, we find the relationship between the velocities:\n$$\nH_M(p, t_0) \\geq H_S(p, t_0) \\implies H_M(p, t_0) + c \\geq H_S(p, t_0) + c \\implies V_M(p, t_0) \\geq V_S(p, t_0)\n$$\nThis means that at the point of first contact, the inner surface $M_{t_0}$ is moving outwards at a speed at least as great as the outer surface $S_{t_0}$. The strong maximum principle forbids even a tangential touch, implying a strict inequality that leads to a contradiction: for the surfaces to meet at $t_0$, the inner one must have been moving faster, which means it would have already crossed the outer one at a time slightly before $t_0$.\n\nThe added constant speed $c$ has no effect on this comparison argument. The constant $c$ is added to the velocity of both surfaces, so it cancels out when comparing their relative speeds. The avoidance principle holds for this modified flow for the same reason it holds for standard mean curvature flow.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{n}{c} \\left( 1 + W_{-1}\\left( \\left(-\\frac{cR_0+n}{n}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{cR_0+n}{n} - \\frac{c^2t}{n}\\right) \\right) \\right)}\n$$", "id": "3027477"}]}
