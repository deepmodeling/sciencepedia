It is a standard exercise in Riemannian geometry and the theory of Ricci flow. All definitions and premises are correct and self-contained. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem consists of two main parts. First, we compute the Ricci tensor for a Riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$. Second, we use this result to solve the Ricci flow equation for two specific initial metrics.\n\nPart 1: Computation of the Ricci Tensor\n\nWe are given the definition of the Ricci tensor as a contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor:\n$$R_{ij} = g^{kl}R_{kilj}$$\nWe are also given the expression for the $(0,4)$ Riemann tensor for a space of constant sectional curvature $K$:\n$$R_{abcd} = K(g_{ac}g_{bd} - g_{ad}g_{bc})$$\nTo find the components $R_{kilj}$, we substitute the indices $a \\to k$, $b \\to i$, $c \\to l$, and $d \\to j$ into the general formula:\n$$R_{kilj} = K(g_{kl}g_{ij} - g_{kj}g_{il})$$\nNow, we substitute this expression into the definition of the Ricci tensor:\n$$R_{ij} = g^{kl} \\left[ K(g_{kl}g_{ij} - g_{kj}g_{il}) \\right]$$\nSince $K$ is a constant scalar, we can factor it out of the sum:\n$$R_{ij} = K \\left[ g^{kl}(g_{kl}g_{ij}) - g^{kl}(g_{kj}g_{il}) \\right]$$\nLet's analyze the two terms in the bracket separately. The summation is over the dummy indices $k$ and $l$.\n\nFor the first term, $g_{ij}$ does not have indices $k$ or $l$, so it can be factored out of the summation:\n$$g^{kl}g_{kl}g_{ij} = g_{ij} (g^{kl}g_{kl})$$\nThe quantity $g^{kl}g_{kl}$ is the trace of the identity matrix, which is the dimension of the manifold, $n$.\n$$g^{kl}g_{kl} = \\sum_{k,l} g^{kl}g_{kl} = \\sum_k (g^{-1}g)_{kk} = \\mathrm{tr}(I) = n$$\nSo, the first term is $n g_{ij}$.\n\nFor the second term, we have the contraction $g^{kl}g_{kj}g_{il}$. We can regroup the summation. Let's contract over the index $k$ first. By the symmetry of the metric tensor, $g_{kj} = g_{jk}$.\n$$g^{kl}g_{kj} = g^{kl}g_{jk}$$\nThe expression $\\sum_k g^{kl}g_{jk}$ is the $(l,j)$-th component of the matrix product $G^{-1}G$, where $G$ is the matrix of the metric and $G^{-1}$ has components $g^{ij}$. Thus, $\\sum_k g^{kl}g_{jk} = \\delta^l_j$.\nThe second term becomes:\n$$g^{kl}g_{kj}g_{il} = \\sum_{l} \\left( \\sum_k g^{kl}g_{kj} \\right) g_{il} = \\sum_{l} \\delta^l_j g_{il} = g_{ji}$$\nSince the metric tensor is symmetric, $g_{ji} = g_{ij}$. So, the second term is $g_{ij}$.\n\nCombining the two terms, we find the expression for the Ricci tensor:\n$$R_{ij} = K ( n g_{ij} - g_{ij} ) = K(n-1)g_{ij}$$\nThis shows that any Riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$ is an Einstein manifold, with the Ricci tensor being proportional to the metric tensor. The constant of proportionality, $\\lambda$, is given by:\n$$\\lambda = K(n-1)$$\n\nNow we apply this result to the two cases given:\n1.  For the round sphere $(S^n, g_{\\mathrm{round}})$, the sectional curvature is constant $K=1$. The Ricci tensor is:\n    $$R_{ij} = 1 \\cdot (n-1)g_{ij} = (n-1)g_{ij}$$\n    So, $\\lambda = n-1$.\n\n2.  For the flat torus $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_{\\mathrm{flat}})$, the sectional curvature is constant $K=0$. The Ricci tensor is:\n    $$R_{ij} = 0 \\cdot (n-1)g_{ij} = 0$$\n    So, $\\lambda = 0$.\n\nPart 2: Solving the Ricci Flow Equation\n\nThe Ricci flow equation is given by the PDE:\n$$\\partial_t g_{ij}(t) = -2 R_{ij}(t)$$\nWe are asked to justify and use the homothetic ansatz $g_{ij}(t) = s(t) g_{ij}(0)$, where $s(t)$ is a time-dependent scaling factor and $g_{ij}(0)$ is the initial metric.\n\nThe justification for this ansatz lies in the scaling properties of the Ricci tensor. For a metric $g' = c g$ where $c$ is a constant, the Ricci tensor is invariant: $R_{ij}(cg) = R_{ij}(g)$. This is because the Christoffel symbols are invariant under constant scaling, and so is the $(1,3)$ Riemann tensor $R^i{}_{jkl}$. While the $(0,4)$ tensor scales as $R'_{ijkl} = c R_{ijkl}$, the Ricci tensor $R'_{ij} = g'^{kl}R'_{kilj} = c^{-1}g^{kl} (c R_{kilj}) = R_{ij}(g)$.\n\nApplying the ansatz $g_{ij}(t) = s(t) g_{ij}(0)$ to the Ricci flow equation:\nThe left-hand side is the time derivative:\n$$\\partial_t g_{ij}(t) = \\partial_t [s(t) g_{ij}(0)] = s'(t) g_{ij}(0)$$\nwhere $s'(t) = \\frac{ds}{dt}$.\n\nThe right-hand side is:\n$$-2 R_{ij}(g(t)) = -2 R_{ij}(s(t)g(0))$$\nSince at any given time $t$, $s(t)$ is a constant scaling factor, the Ricci tensor of the scaled metric is the same as the Ricci tensor of the original metric:\n$$-2 R_{ij}(s(t)g(0)) = -2 R_{ij}(g(0))$$\nFrom Part 1, we know that the initial metrics are Einstein, so $R_{ij}(g(0)) = \\lambda g_{ij}(0)$.\nThus, the right-hand side becomes:\n$$-2 \\lambda g_{ij}(0)$$\nEquating the left and right sides of the PDE:\n$$s'(t) g_{ij}(0) = -2 \\lambda g_{ij}(0)$$\nSince this equation must hold for all components, we can cancel the tensor $g_{ij}(0)$ to obtain an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the scaling factor $s(t)$:\n$$s'(t) = -2\\lambda$$\nThe initial condition is $g(0) = g_{ij}(0)$, which implies $s(0)g_{ij}(0) = g_{ij}(0)$, so $s(0)=1$.\nWe integrate the ODE:\n$$\\int_{s(0)}^{s(t)} ds = \\int_0^t -2\\lambda d\\tau$$\n$$s(t) - s(0) = -2\\lambda t$$\nWith $s(0)=1$, the solution is:\n$$s(t) = 1 - 2\\lambda t$$\n\nNow we solve for the specific cases:\n1.  For the flat torus, $\\lambda=0$. The solution is $s(t) = 1 - 0 = 1$. This means $g(t) = g(0)$ for all time $t$. A flat metric is a fixed point of the Ricci flow, as expected, since its Ricci tensor is zero.\n\n2.  For the round sphere, $\\lambda = n-1$. The solution for the scaling factor is:\n    $$s(t) = 1 - 2(n-1)t$$\n    This shows the sphere shrinks homothetically under the Ricci flow. The volume of the manifold, which scales as $s(t)^{n/2}$, goes to zero in finite time.\n\nThe spherical extinction time $T$ is defined by the condition $s(T)=0$. We set the expression for $s(t)$ to zero and solve for $T$:\n$$1 - 2(n-1)T = 0$$\n$$2(n-1)T = 1$$\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2(n-1)}$$\nThis expression is the final answer.

To compute this, we rely on three fundamental principles of Riemannian geometry:\n\n1.  **Ricci Tensor of a Product Manifold**: For a Riemannian product manifold $(M, g) = (M'_1, g'_1) \\times (M'_2, g'_2)$, the Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}(g)$ is the direct sum of the Ricci tensors of the factor manifolds, $\\mathrm{Ric}(g'_1)$ and $\\mathrm{Ric}(g'_2)$. That is, $\\mathrm{Ric}(g) = \\mathrm{Ric}(g'_1) \\oplus \\mathrm{Ric}(g'_2)$.\n2.  **Scaling of the Ricci Tensor**: If a metric $g'$ is scaled by a positive constant $c$, giving a new metric $\\tilde{g} = c g'$, the Ricci tensor is invariant: $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\tilde{g}) = \\mathrm{Ric}(g')$.\n3.  **Ricci Tensor of a Space Form**: For a Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$ with constant sectional curvature $k$, its Ricci tensor is given by $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)k g$.\n\nAt any given time $t$, the metric $g(t) = a(t)\\, g_{1} \\oplus b(t)\\, g_{2}$ can be viewed as the metric of the product manifold $(M_1, a(t)g_1) \\times (M_2, b(t)g_2)$.\n\nUsing Principle 1, the Ricci tensor of $g(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t)) = \\mathrm{Ric}(a(t)g_1) \\oplus \\mathrm{Ric}(b(t)g_2)\n$$\n\nNow, we apply Principle 2. At any fixed time $t$, $a(t)$ and $b(t)$ are constant scaling factors for the metrics $g_1$ and $g_2$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(a(t)g_1) = \\mathrm{Ric}(g_1)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(b(t)g_2) = \\mathrm{Ric}(g_2)\n$$\nThis simplifies the expression for the Ricci tensor of $g(t)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t)) = \\mathrm{Ric}(g_1) \\oplus \\mathrm{Ric}(g_2)\n$$\n\nNext, we use Principle 3. Since $(M_1, g_1)$ is a space of dimension $n_1$ with constant sectional curvature $k_1$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(g_1) = (n_1 - 1) k_1 g_1\n$$\nSimilarly, for $(M_2, g_2)$ of dimension $n_2$ and constant sectional curvature $k_2$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(g_2) = (n_2 - 1) k_2 g_2\n$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for $\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t)) = \\left( (n_1 - 1) k_1 g_1 \\right) \\oplus \\left( (n_2 - 1) k_2 g_2 \\right)\n$$\nThis expression is valid for all $t$ for which the solution exists.\n\nNow, we can write the full Ricci flow equation:\n$$\na'(t)\\, g_{1} \\oplus b'(t)\\, g_{2} = -2 \\left[ \\left( (n_1 - 1) k_1 g_1 \\right) \\oplus \\left( (n_2 - 1) k_2 g_2 \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\na'(t)\\, g_{1} \\oplus b'(t)\\, g_{2} = \\left( -2(n_1 - 1) k_1 g_1 \\right) \\oplus \\left( -2(n_2 - 1) k_2 g_2 \\right)\n$$\nSince the tensors $g_1$ and $g_2$ form the block components of the metric, we can equate the coefficients of each block separately:\nFor the $M_1$ component:\n$$\na'(t) g_1 = -2(n_1 - 1) k_1 g_1\n$$\n$$\n\\implies a'(t) = -2(n_1 - 1) k_1\n$$\nFor the $M_2$ component:\n$$\nb'(t) g_2 = -2(n_2 - 1) k_2 g_2\n$$\n$$\n\\implies b'(t) = -2(n_2 - 1) k_2\n$$\nThese equations give the rates of change for all $t$. The initial rates are found by evaluating at $t=0$. Since the expressions are constant, the rates are constant:\n$$\na'(0) = -2(n_1 - 1) k_1\n$$\n$$\nb'(0) = -2(n_2 - 1) k_2\n$$\nThe problem also asks to determine if the product structure is preserved for short time. Our calculation shows that if we assume a product structure $g(t) = a(t)g_1 \\oplus b(t)g_2$, its Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))$ also has a product structure, specifically $C_1 g_1 \\oplus C_2 g_2$ where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants. The Ricci flow equation $\\partial_t g(t) = -2 \\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))$ thus preserves the block-diagonal form of the metric, since no off-diagonal terms are generated by the flow.

Since scalar component multiplication is commutative, $h_{\\alpha a} = h_{a\\alpha}$.\nUsing $h_{\\alpha a} = h_{a\\alpha}$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}(h)_{a \\alpha} = - (p-1)\\kappa_p h_{a\\alpha} - (q-1)\\kappa_q h_{a\\alpha}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}(h)_{a \\alpha} = \\left( -((p-1)\\kappa_p + (q-1)\\kappa_q) \\right) h_{a\\alpha}\n$$\nThis is of the form $\\mathcal{C}(h)_{a \\alpha} = \\lambda h_{a \\alpha}$. By comparing the expressions, we identify the proportionality factor $\\lambda$.\n\nThe proportionality factor $\\lambda$ is:\n$$\n\\lambda = -((p-1)\\kappa_p + (q-1)\\kappa_q)\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-( (p-1)\\kappa_p + (q-1)\\kappa_q )}\n$$", "id": "3036545"}]}
