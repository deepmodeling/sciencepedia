The problem states that the hypersurface is $M_t = \\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\{0\\}$, which is identified with $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The induced measure $d\\mu_t$ is the standard $n$-dimensional Lebesgue measure, which we denote as $dx$.

The problem's context implies a simplified covariance structure, specifically an isotropic Gaussian where the covariance matrix is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, $\\Sigma = \\sigma^2 I_n$. In this case, $\\det(\\Sigma) = (\\sigma^2)^n$ and $\\Sigma^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} I_n$. The quadratic form $(x-\\mu)^T I_n (x-\\mu)$ is simply the squared Euclidean norm $|x-\\mu|^2$.
