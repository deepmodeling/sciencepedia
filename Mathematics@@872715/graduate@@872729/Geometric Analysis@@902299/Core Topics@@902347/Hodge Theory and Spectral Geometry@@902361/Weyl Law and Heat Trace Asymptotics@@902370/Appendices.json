A highly accurate uniform asymptotic approximation for the zeros $j_{m,k}$ is derived from the Debye asymptotic expansion of $J_m(z)$ for large arguments. For a large value $z > m$, the zeros are given by the solutions to:\n$$\n\\sqrt{z^2 - m^2} - m \\arccos\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right) - \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\approx (k-1)\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\left( k - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\pi\n$$\nSolving for $k$, we find the number of zeros up to a value $z$ for a given $m$:\n$$\nk \\approx \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\sqrt{z^2 - m^2} - m \\arccos\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right) \\right) + \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nSo, for $z=L$, the number of zeros $K_m(L)$ is the number of integers $k \\geq 1$ satisfying this condition.
