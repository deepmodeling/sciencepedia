The metric is given by $g_{c} = c^{2} g_{\\mathrm{can}}$, where $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ is the standard metric on the unit sphere $S^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and $c > 0$ is a constant. The computation is to be performed by analyzing the function $f(x) = x_{n+1}$ and the Hessian equation it satisfies.\n\nFirst, let us establish the relationship between the geometric quantities associated with the metrics $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and $g_{c}$. Let $\\nabla$ and $\\nabla^{c}$ be the Levi-Civita connections corresponding to $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and $g_{c}$, respectively. For any vector fields $X, Y, Z$ on $S^{n}$, Koszul's formula for $\\nabla^{c}$ is:\n$$2g_{c}(\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y, Z) = X(g_{c}(Y,Z)) + Y(g_{c}(X,Z)) - Z(g_{c}(X,Y)) + g_{c}([X,Y],Z) - g_{c}([X,Z],Y) - g_{c}([Y,Z],X)$$\nSubstituting $g_{c} = c^{2} g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and noting that $c$ is a constant, we have:\n$$2c^{2}g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y, Z) = c^{2} \\left[ X(g_{\\mathrm{can}}(Y,Z)) + \\dots \\right] = c^{2} \\left[ 2g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z) \\right]$$\nThis implies $g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y, Z) = g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z)$. Since this holds for any vector field $Z$, we conclude that the Levi-Civita connection is invariant under constant scaling of the metric:\n$$\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y = \\nabla_{X}Y$$\n\nNext, we compute the Hessian of the function $f(x) = x_{n+1}$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$. Let $\\tilde{f}: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be the linear function $\\tilde{f}(x) = x_{n+1}$ whose restriction to $S^{n}$ is $f$. Let $D$ denote the flat connection on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The gradient of $\\tilde{f}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is the constant vector field $D\\tilde{f} = E_{n+1} = (0, \\dots, 0, 1)$.\n\nThe gradient of $f$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$, denoted $\\mathrm{grad}_{g_{\\mathrm{can}}} f$, is the tangential projection of $D\\tilde{f}$ onto the tangent spaces of $S^{n}$. At a point $p \\in S^{n}$, the outward unit normal vector is $N(p) = p$. The tangential projection of a vector $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is $V^{\\top} = V - g_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}(V, N)N$. Thus,\n$$\\mathrm{grad}_{g_{\\mathrm{can}}} f (p) = (E_{n+1})^{\\top} = E_{n+1} - g_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}(E_{n+1}, p) p = E_{n+1} - p_{n+1} p$$\nSince $f(p) = p_{n+1}$, we can write this vector field as $G(p) = E_{n+1} - f(p)N(p)$.\n\nThe Hessian tensor $\\nabla^{2}f$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$ is given by $(\\nabla^{2}f)(X,Y) = g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla_{X}(\\mathrm{grad}_{g_{\\mathrm{can}}}f), Y)$. The covariant derivative $\\nabla_{X}G$ is the tangential projection of the ambient derivative $D_{X}G$:\n$$\\nabla_{X}G = (D_{X}G)^{\\top} = (D_{X}(E_{n+1} - fN))^{\\top}$$\nWe compute the ambient derivative term by term for a tangent vector field $X$:\n$$D_{X}(E_{n+1} - fN) = D_{X}E_{n+1} - D_{X}(fN)$$\nSince $E_{n+1}$ is a constant vector field, $D_{X}E_{n+1} = 0$. Using the product rule for $D_{X}(fN)$:\n$$D_{X}(fN) = (Xf)N + f(D_{X}N)$$\nFor the unit sphere $S^{n}$, the shape operator $S(X) = -D_{X}N$ is given by $S(X)= -X$ (with $N(p)=p$, the ambient derivative $D_X N = D_X p = X$, so $S(X)=-X$). The second fundamental form is $\\mathrm{II}(X,Y) = g_{\\mathrm{can}}(S(X),Y) = -g_{\\mathrm{can}}(X,Y)$. From the definition $S(X) = -D_X N$ and the result $S(X)=-X$, we have $D_X N = X$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $D_X(fN)$:\n$$D_{X}(fN) = (Xf)N + fX$$\nTherefore, $D_{X}G = -((Xf)N + fX)$. Taking the tangential projection:\n$$\\nabla_{X}G = (- (Xf)N - fX)^{\\top} = -fX$$\nsince $X$ is tangent and $N$ is normal.\nThe Hessian of $f$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$ is then:\n$$(\\nabla^{2}f)(X,Y) = g_{\\mathrm{can}}(-fX, Y) = -f g_{\\mathrm{can}}(X,Y)$$\nThis means the Hessian tensor is $\\nabla^{2}f = -f g_{\\mathrm{can}}$.\n\nNow we consider the Hessian $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f$ with respect to the metric $g_{c}$. The Hessian as a bilinear form is defined by $(\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f)(X,Y) = X(Y(f)) - (\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y)(f)$. Since $\\nabla^{c} = \\nabla$, we have:\n$$(\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f)(X,Y) = X(Y(f)) - (\\nabla_{X}Y)(f) = (\\nabla^{2}f)(X,Y)$$\nSo, the Hessian tensor is unchanged: $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f = \\nabla^{2}f = -f g_{\\mathrm{can}}$.\n\nThe problem asks to find the constant $k$ such that $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f + kfg_{c} = 0$. We substitute our result for $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f$:\n$$-f g_{\\mathrm{can}} + kfg_{c} = 0$$\nUsing the relation $g_{c} = c^{2}g_{\\mathrm{can}}$, we get:\n$$-f g_{\\mathrm{can}} + kf(c^{2}g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = 0$$\n$$f(-1 + kc^{2})g_{\\mathrm{can}} = 0$$\nSince this equation must hold for all points on $S^{n}$, and $f$ is not identically zero, the term in the parenthesis must be zero:\n$$-1 + kc^{2} = 0 \\implies k = \\frac{1}{c^{2}}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta_{g_{c}}f$. This operator is defined as the trace of the Hessian with respect to the metric $g_{c}$:\n$$\\Delta_{g_{c}}f = \\mathrm{tr}_{g_{c}}(\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f)$$\nUsing the Hessian equation $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f = -kfg_{c} = -\\frac{1}{c^{2}}fg_{c}$, we find:\n$$\\Delta_{g_{c}}f = \\mathrm{tr}_{g_{c}}\\left(-\\frac{1}{c^{2}}fg_{c}\\right) = -\\frac{f}{c^{2}} \\mathrm{tr}_{g_{c}}(g_{c})$$\nThe trace of the metric tensor on an $n$-dimensional manifold is the dimension $n$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{tr}_{g_{c}}(g_{c}) = n$.\nThe Laplacian of $f$ is thus:\n$$\\Delta_{g_{c}}f = -\\frac{n}{c^{2}}f$$\nThe eigenvalue equation for the Laplacian is conventionally written as $\\Delta \\phi = -\\lambda \\phi$. Comparing this with our result, we identify the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ associated with the eigenfunction $f$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{n}{c^{2}}$$\nThe function $f(x)=x_{n+1}$ is a coordinate function restricted to the sphere, which is a spherical harmonic of degree $1$. It is a classical result that such functions are eigenfunctions corresponding to the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian on the sphere.

The components of the metric $g$ are denoted by $g_{ij}$, and the components of its inverse are $g^{ij}$. For the rescaled metric $g_{r}$, the components are $(g_{r})_{ij} = r^{2} g_{ij}$, and the components of its inverse are $(g_{r})^{ij} = (r^{2} g_{ij})^{-1} = r^{-2} g^{ij}$. The determinant of the metric matrix scales as $\\det(g_{r}) = \\det(r^{2} [g_{ij}]) = (r^{2})^{n} \\det(g) = r^{2n} \\det(g)$.

Thus, $\\Omega(y) = \\frac{2}{1+|y|^2}$.\n\nNext, we write the metric in the Yamabe-conformal form $g = u(y)^{\\frac{4}{n-2}} g_{\\mathbb{R}^n}$.\nBy comparison, we have $u(y)^{\\frac{4}{n-2}} = \\Omega(y)^2 = \\frac{4}{(1+|y|^2)^2}$.\nRaising both sides to the power of $\\frac{n-2}{4}$:\n$$\nu(y) = \\left( \\frac{4}{(1+|y|^2)^2} \\right)^{\\frac{n-2}{4}} = 4^{\\frac{n-2}{4}} \\left( (1+|y|^2)^{-2} \\right)^{\\frac{n-2}{4}} = (2^2)^{\\frac{n-2}{4}} (1+|y|^2)^{-\\frac{n-2}{2}}\n$$\n$$\nu(y) = 2^{\\frac{n-2}{2}} (1+|y|^2)^{-\\frac{n-2}{2}} = \\left( \\frac{2}{1+|y|^2} \\right)^{\\frac{n-2}{2}}\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for $u(y)$.\n\nNow we derive the PDE for $u$. The scalar curvature $R_g$ of a conformal metric $g = u^{\\frac{4}{n-2}}g_0$ is related to the scalar curvature $R_{g_0}$ of the background metric $g_0$ by the transformation law:\n$$\nR_g = u^{-\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} \\left( R_{g_0} u - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\Delta_{g_0} u \\right)\n$$\nIn our case, $g_0 = g_{\\mathbb{R}^n}$ is the flat Euclidean metric, so $R_{g_0} = 0$. The metric $g$ is isometric to the round metric on the unit sphere $S^n$, so its scalar curvature $R_g$ must be that of the unit sphere, which is $R_{S^n} = n(n-1)$.\nSubstituting these values into the transformation law:\n$$\nn(n-1) = u^{-\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} \\left( - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^n} u \\right)\n$$\nAssuming $u>0$ and since $n \\ge 3$, we can rearrange to find the PDE for $u$:\n$$\nn(n-1) u^{\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} = - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\Delta u\n$$\nDividing by $n-1$:\n$$\nn u^{\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} = - \\frac{4}{n-2} \\Delta u \\implies \\Delta u = - \\frac{n(n-2)}{4} u^{\\frac{n+2}{n-2}}\n$$\nThis is the Yamabe equation on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nWe must verify that our explicit $u(y) = C(1+|y|^2)^{-p}$ with $C=2^{\\frac{n-2}{2}}$ and $p=\\frac{n-2}{2}$ is a solution. Let $r = |y|$. The function is radial, $u(r) = C(1+r^2)^{-p}$.

Thus, our explicit function $u(y)$ solves the Yamabe equation.\n\nThis calculation connects to the Obata rigidity theorem by providing the canonical model for its conclusion. The theorem states, in one form, that a complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ admitting a non-trivial function $f$ satisfying $\\operatorname{Hess}(f) = -c f g$ for some constant $c>0$ must be isometric to a round sphere. The existence of such a function $f$ is a very strong condition. Our calculation demonstrates the conformal equivalent of this situation. We began with the round sphere and showed it is conformally equivalent to Euclidean space with a metric defined by the function $u(y)$. This function $u(y)$ is a solution to the Yamabe equation, which is the conformal version of a constant scalar curvature condition. The \"rigidity\" aspect, established by the work of Caffarelli, Gidas, and Spruck, is that (up to translations and dilations, which correspond to conformal transformations of $S^n$) the function $u(y)$ we found is the *unique* positive solution to this Yamabe equation on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Therefore, any complete, conformally flat metric on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with constant positive scalar curvature must be defined by one of these functions, and is therefore isometric to the round sphere. Our calculation explicitly constructs the fundamental solution that serves as the unique model, thereby illustrating the mechanism of rigidity: the strict constraints of the conformally invariant PDE permit only this highly symmetric family of solutions, which all correspond to the same geometric object, the round sphere.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{2}{1+|y|^{2}} \\right)^{\\frac{n-2}{2}}}$$", "id": "3036327"}]}
