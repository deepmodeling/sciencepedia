Since $\\gamma$ is a minimizing geodesic, the second variation of the arc length functional must be non-negative for any proper variation of $\\gamma$. The second variation is given by the index form $I\\left(V, V\\right)$, where $V$ is a piecewise smooth vector field along $\\gamma$ such that $V(0) = 0$ and $V(L) = 0$. The formula for the index form is:\n$$ I\\left(V, V\\right) = \\int_0^L \\left( g\\left(\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}V, \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}V\\right) - g\\left(R\\left(V, \\dot{\\gamma}\\right)\\dot{\\gamma}, V\\right) \\right) dt $$\nwhere $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.

This implies $L^2 > \\pi^2$, and so $\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}  1$. Consequently, the term $\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} - 1\\right)$ is negative. Since $n \\ge 2$ and $L>0$, the entire expression is negative:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} I\\left(V_i, V_i\\right)  0 $$\nIf the sum of these terms is negative, at least one of the terms must be negative. That is, there exists some $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ such that $I(V_j, V_j)  0$. This contradicts the fact that $\\gamma$ is a length-minimizing geodesic, for which the second variation must be non-negative for all proper variations.\nTherefore, the assumption $L > \\pi$ must be false. We conclude that $L \\le \\pi$ for any minimizing geodesic. Since the diameter is the supremum of lengths of minimizing geodesics, $\\operatorname{diam}(M,g) \\le \\pi$.\n\n**Part 2: The general case with $k>0$**\n\nNow we consider the general case where $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g}\\left(v,v\\right) \\geq \\left(n-1\\right)k\\,g\\left(v,v\\right)$ for some constant $k>0$. We will rescale the metric $g$ to a new metric $g'$ to normalize the curvature bound, apply the result from Part 1, and then transfer the result back to the original metric $g$.\n\nLet $g' = \\alpha g$ for a constant $\\alpha > 0$ to be determined. We must analyze how the geometric quantities transform.\nThe Christoffel symbols of the connection $\\nabla'$ for $g'$ are identical to those of $\\nabla$ for $g$. This is because $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ij}^l = \\frac{1}{2} (g')^{lm} (\\partial_i g'_{jm} + \\partial_j g'_{im} - \\partial_m g'_{ij}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{\\alpha}g^{lm} (\\alpha \\partial_i g_{jm} + \\dots) = \\Gamma_{ij}^l$.\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor $R^l{}_{ijk}$ (type (1,3)) depends only on the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives, so its components are invariant under this scaling: $R'^l{}_{ijk} = R^l{}_{ijk}$.\nThe Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}$ (type (0,2)) components are given by the contraction $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = R^l{}_{ilj}$. Thus, the components of the Ricci tensor are also invariant under scaling: $\\operatorname{Ric}'_{ij} = \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the Ricci curvature as a quadratic form on tangent vectors. For a vector $v$, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}_{g'}(v,v) = \\operatorname{Ric}'_{ij}v^iv^j = \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}v^iv^j = \\operatorname{Ric}_g(v,v) $$\nHowever, the metric itself scales:\n$$ g'(v,v) = g'_{ij}v^iv^j = \\alpha g_{ij}v^iv^j = \\alpha g(v,v) $$\nWe are given the condition $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g}\\left(v,v\\right) \\geq \\left(n-1\\right)k\\,g\\left(v,v\\right)$. We want to choose $\\alpha$ such that the new metric $g'$ satisfies the normalized condition $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g'}\\left(v,v\\right) \\geq \\left(n-1\\right) \\cdot 1 \\cdot g'\\left(v,v\\right)$.\nSubstituting our findings:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}_{g'}(v,v) = \\operatorname{Ric}_{g}(v,v) \\ge (n-1)k \\, g(v,v) $$\nWe need this to be greater than or equal to $(n-1)g'(v,v) = (n-1)\\alpha g(v,v)$. This requires:\n$$ (n-1)k \\, g(v,v) \\ge (n-1)\\alpha g(v,v) $$\nfor the comparison to hold. To make the bound tight and normalized (i.e., with constant $1$), we should have equality between the lower bounds:\n$$ (n-1)k \\, g(v,v) = (n-1)\\alpha g(v,v) $$\nThis implies we must choose $\\alpha = k$. So, the correctly scaled metric is $g' = k g$. With this choice, $(M, g')$ is a complete, connected Riemannian manifold satisfying $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g'} \\ge (n-1)g'$, which are the hypotheses of Part 1.\n\nThe length of a curve $\\gamma$ with respect to $g'$ is\n$$ L_{g'}(\\gamma) = \\int \\sqrt{g'(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})} dt = \\int \\sqrt{k g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})} dt = \\sqrt{k} \\int \\sqrt{g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})} dt = \\sqrt{k} L_g(\\gamma) $$\nSince distance is the infimum of curve lengths, the distances scale accordingly: $d_{g'}(p,q) = \\sqrt{k} d_g(p,q)$.\nConsequently, the diameters are related by $\\operatorname{diam}(M, g') = \\sqrt{k} \\operatorname{diam}(M, g)$.\n\nFrom Part 1, we know that for the manifold $(M, g')$, the diameter is bounded:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(M, g') \\le \\pi $$\nSubstituting the relation between the diameters:\n$$ \\sqrt{k} \\operatorname{diam}(M, g) \\le \\pi $$\nSince $k>0$, we can solve for the diameter with respect to the original metric $g$:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(M, g) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}} $$\nThis is the celebrated Bonnet-Myers diameter bound. This bound is known to be sharp; for instance, the $n$-sphere of radius $R=1/\\sqrt{k}$ has constant Ricci curvature $(n-1)k$ and diameter $\\pi R = \\pi/\\sqrt{k}$.

It is a valid problem in differential geometry.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Analysis of the core problem**\n\nThe problem asks for an explanation of two related facts:\n1.  Why the diameter of Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_0)$ is infinite.\n2.  How this fact demonstrates the necessity of the strict inequality $k0$ in the hypothesis $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge (n-1)k$ of the Bonnet–Myers theorem.\n\nFirst, let us establish the diameter of $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_0)$. The metric $g_0$ is the standard Euclidean metric, whose geodesics are straight lines. The geodesic distance $d_{g_0}(x,y)$ between two points $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the length of the straight line segment connecting them, which is given by the Euclidean norm of the vector difference: $d_{g_0}(x,y) = \\|x-y\\|$. The diameter is the supremum of these distances over all pairs of points: $\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0) = \\sup_{x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n} \\|x-y\\|$. For any real number $R0$, we can choose points $x$ and $y$ such that their distance is $R$. For example, let $x$ be the origin $(0,\\dots,0)$ and $y$ be the point $(R,0,\\dots,0)$. Then $d_{g_0}(x,y) = \\|(R,0,\\dots,0)\\| = R$. Since $R$ can be arbitrarily large, the supremum is not finite. Therefore, $\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0) = \\infty$.\n\nSecond, let us connect this to the Bonnet–Myers theorem. The theorem states that if a complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ has Ricci curvature satisfying $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)k g$ for a constant $k0$, then $M$ is compact and its diameter is bounded above by $\\pi/\\sqrt{k}$.\nFor $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_0)$, the manifold is complete and the Ricci curvature is identically zero, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$. This satisfies the condition $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)k g$ for $k=0$, but it does not satisfy the condition for any $k0$. We have just shown that the conclusion of the Bonnet–Myers theorem (finite diameter) does not hold for $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_0)$. This shows that the hypothesis cannot be relaxed from $k0$ to $k \\ge 0$. The case of $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_0)$ serves as a crucial example demonstrating that the strict positivity of the Ricci curvature lower bound is essential for the theorem's conclusion.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. In $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$ one has $d_{g_0}(x,y)=\\|x-y\\|$, so for any $R0$ there exist points $x,y$ with $d_{g_0}(x,y)=R$. Hence $\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)=\\infty$. This shows that without a strictly positive lower bound on $\\operatorname{Ric}$ one cannot conclude a finite diameter.**\nThis statement is entirely correct. It begins by accurately calculating the diameter of $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_0)$ as infinite. It then correctly concludes that this example, having $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$ (a non-strictly positive lower bound), demonstrates that the strict positivity condition in the Bonnet–Myers theorem is necessary to guarantee a finite diameter. The logic is sound and directly follows the analysis above.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Because $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$ on $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$, there must be directions of strictly negative sectional curvature somewhere, which implies infinite volume growth and therefore infinite diameter.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The premise that $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$ implies the existence of strictly negative sectional curvature is false. For $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$, the sectional curvature is identically zero for all $2$-planes at all points. The Ricci curvature is an average of sectional curvatures; it is possible for it to be zero while the sectional curvatures are a mix of positive and negative, but it is not a necessity. Since the initial logical step is flawed, the entire statement is invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. By the Hopf–Rinow theorem, geodesic completeness implies compactness of the manifold. Since $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$ is geodesically complete, it must be compact, and hence it has finite diameter. The claim of infinite diameter therefore contradicts Hopf–Rinow.**\nThis statement fundamentally misrepresents the Hopf–Rinow theorem. Geodesic completeness does *not* imply compactness of the entire manifold. The theorem states that for a connected Riemannian manifold, completeness is equivalent to the property that all closed and bounded subsets are compact. A complete manifold is compact if and only if it is also bounded (has finite diameter). $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_0)$ is a standard example of a complete but non-compact manifold. Its existence does not contradict the Hopf–Rinow theorem; rather, it illustrates this exact distinction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The failure of strict positivity is essential: there exist complete Riemannian manifolds with $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$ and infinite diameter, and $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$ is a basic example. Conversely, $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$ does not force infinite diameter in general (for example, flat tori are compact with finite diameter), so strict positivity $k0$ is precisely the hypothesis that ensures a universal diameter bound via Bonnet–Myers.**\nThis statement provides a sophisticated and accurate analysis. It correctly identifies $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$ as a prime example of a complete manifold with $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$ and infinite diameter. It then astutely introduces the counterexample of a flat torus ($\\mathbb{T}^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\Gamma$ for a lattice $\\Gamma$), which also has $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$ but is compact and has finite diameter. The comparison of these two cases—Euclidean space and the torus—perfectly illustrates that the condition $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$ is insufficient to determine whether the diameter is finite or infinite. This correctly leads to the conclusion that the strict inequality, $k0$, is the crucial part of the Bonnet-Myers hypothesis needed to force a finite diameter.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Even with only $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$, the Bonnet–Myers theorem provides a dimension-dependent finite upper bound for the diameter. In the case of $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$, this bound becomes infinite, so the theorem predicts $\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)=\\infty$ directly from $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The Bonnet–Myers theorem, as stated, applies only when $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)k$ for some $k0$. It makes no claim about the case $k=0$ (i.e., $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$). While one can observe that the bound $\\pi/\\sqrt{k}$ approaches infinity as $k \\to 0^+$, this is a heuristic limit, not part of the theorem's statement. The theorem does not \"predict\" an infinite diameter; it simply does not apply. Theorems such as the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem address the $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$ case, but that is a different result.

I will proceed with the solution by addressing the three required parts in sequence.\n\nThe given manifold is $(M^n, g_k)$, where $n \\ge 2$ and $k>0$. It is constructed from the product of the interval $I=[0, \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}]$ and the unit $(n-1)$-sphere $(S^{n-1}, g_{S^{n-1}})$ with the warped product metric\n$$\ng_k = dt^2 + f_k(t)^2 g_{S^{n-1}}\n$$\nwhere the warping function is $f_k(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)$. The boundary components at $t=0$ and $t=\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$ are collapsed to points, which we will refer to as the south pole $P_S$ and north pole $P_N$, respectively.\n\n**1. Verification of Smoothness**\n\nTo verify that the metric $g_k$ is smooth on the entire manifold $M^n$, including the poles $P_S$ and $P_N$, we must check the behavior of the warping function $f_k(t)$ at the endpoints of the interval $I$.\n\nA metric of the form $g=dt^2 + f(t)^2 g_{S^{n-1}}$ on $[0, a) \\times S^{n-1}$ extends smoothly to a metric on the $n$-disk $D^n$ (by collapsing the boundary $\\{0\\} \\times S^{n-1}$ to the origin) if and only if $f$ is a smooth function on $[0, a)$ satisfying:\n(i) $f(t) > 0$ for $t \\in (0, a)$,\n(ii) $f(0) = 0$,\n(iii) $f'(0) = 1$,\n(iv) all even-order derivatives of $f$ vanish at $t=0$, i.e., $f^{(2j)}(0)=0$ for all integers $j \\ge 0$. This is equivalent to $f$ being the restriction of a smooth, odd function defined on $(-a, a)$.\n\nLet's check these conditions for $f_k(t)$ at $t=0$.\nThe function $f_k(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)$ is smooth for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n(i) For $t \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}})$, we have $\\sqrt{k}t \\in (0, \\pi)$, so $\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t) > 0$, and thus $f_k(t)>0$.\n(ii) $f_k(0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(0) = 0$.\n(iii) The first derivative is $f_k'(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} \\cdot \\sqrt{k}\\cos(\\sqrt{k}t) = \\cos(\\sqrt{k}t)$. At $t=0$, $f_k'(0) = \\cos(0) = 1$.\n(iv) The higher-order derivatives are $f_k^{(m)}(t) = k^{(m-1)/2} \\sin(\\sqrt{k}t + \\frac{(m-1)\\pi}{2})$ or similar forms. More easily, we see that $f_k''(t) = -\\sqrt{k}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)$. In general, the even derivatives $f_k^{(2j)}(t)$ will be proportional to $\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)$, while odd derivatives $f_k^{(2j+1)}(t)$ will be proportional to $\\cos(\\sqrt{k}t)$. Therefore, $f_k^{(2j)}(0)$ is always proportional to $\\sin(0) = 0$.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied at $t=0$, so the metric is smooth across the south pole $P_S$.\n\nNow, let's examine the north pole $P_N$ at $t = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$. We introduce a new coordinate $\\tau = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}} - t$. As $t \\to \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$, we have $\\tau \\to 0^+$. The interval for $\\tau$ is $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}]$.\nIn terms of $\\tau$, the metric becomes $g_k = d\\tau^2 + f_k(\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}-\\tau)^2 g_{S^{n-1}}$. Let's define a new warping function $\\tilde{f}_k(\\tau) = f_k(\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}-\\tau)$.\n$$\n\\tilde{f}_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin\\left(\\sqrt{k}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}-\\tau\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\pi - \\sqrt{k}\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}\\tau)\n$$\nThis is exactly the same functional form as $f_k(t)$. Thus, $\\tilde{f}_k(\\tau)$ satisfies the same smoothness conditions at $\\tau=0$ as $f_k(t)$ does at $t=0$. The metric is therefore also smooth across the north pole $P_N$.\nThis completes the verification that $(M^n, g_k)$ is a smooth Riemannian manifold.\n\n**2. Computation of Ricci Curvature**\n\nWe will compute the sectional curvatures of $(M^n, g_k)$ first. For a warped product $I \\times_f S^{n-1}$, the sectional curvatures are given by two formulas.\nLet $X = \\partial_t$ be the unit vector field tangent to the base interval $I$. Let $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^{n-1}$ be a local orthonormal frame for the fiber $(S^{n-1}, g_{S^{n-1}})$. Then $\\{\\partial_t, \\frac{1}{f_k(t)}E_1, \\dots, \\frac{1}{f_k(t)}E_{n-1}\\}$ is a local orthonormal frame for $(M^n, g_k)$.\n\n(a) For a plane spanned by a vector tangent to the base and a vector tangent to the fiber, e.g., $\\partial_t$ and $\\frac{1}{f_k}E_i$, the sectional curvature is:\n$$\nK(\\partial_t, \\frac{1}{f_k}E_i) = -\\frac{f_k''(t)}{f_k(t)}\n$$\nWe compute the second derivative of $f_k(t)$:\n$f_k'(t) = \\cos(\\sqrt{k}t)$\n$f_k''(t) = -\\sqrt{k}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t) = -k \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)\\right) = -k f_k(t)$.\nSo, $\\frac{f_k''(t)}{f_k(t)} = -k$.\nThe sectional curvature is $K(\\partial_t, \\frac{1}{f_k}E_i) = -(-k) = k$.\n\n(b) For a plane spanned by two vectors tangent to the fiber, e.g., $\\frac{1}{f_k}E_i$ and $\\frac{1}{f_k}E_j$ for $i \\ne j$, the sectional curvature is:\n$$\nK(\\frac{1}{f_k}E_i, \\frac{1}{f_k}E_j) = \\frac{K_{fiber} - (f_k'(t))^2}{f_k(t)^2}\n$$\nwhere $K_{fiber}$ is the sectional curvature of the fiber. The fiber is the unit $(n-1)$-sphere, which has constant sectional curvature $K_{S^{n-1}} = 1$.\n$$\nK(\\frac{1}{f_k}E_i, \\frac{1}{f_k}E_j) = \\frac{1 - (f_k'(t))^2}{f_k(t)^2}\n$$\nUsing $f_k'(t) = \\cos(\\sqrt{k}t)$ and $f_k(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)$, we get:\n$$\nK(\\frac{1}{f_k}E_i, \\frac{1}{f_k}E_j) = \\frac{1 - \\cos^2(\\sqrt{k}t)}{(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t))^2} = \\frac{\\sin^2(\\sqrt{k}t)}{\\frac{1}{k}\\sin^2(\\sqrt{k}t)} = k\n$$\nSince all sectional curvatures are constant and equal to $k$, $(M^n, g_k)$ is a space of constant curvature $k$.\nFor a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Ricci tensor is given by $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1)K g$. In our case, $K=k$, so\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_k} = (n-1)k g_k\n$$\nThis shows that $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_k} \\ge (n-1)k g_k$ is satisfied (as an equality).\n\n**3. Computation of Diameter**\n\nThe diameter of a Riemannian manifold is the supremum of the geodesic distance over all pairs of points.\nLet $P_S$ and $P_N$ be the south and north poles of $M^n$, corresponding to $t=0$ and $t=\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$, respectively. Let's compute the distance between them along a meridian. A meridian is a curve $\\gamma(t) = (t, \\sigma_0)$, where $\\sigma_0 \\in S^{n-1}$ is a fixed point. The tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\partial_t$.\nThe length of this curve is:\n$$\nL(\\gamma) = \\int_{0}^{\\pi/\\sqrt{k}} \\sqrt{g_k(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\pi/\\sqrt{k}} \\sqrt{g_k(\\partial_t, \\partial_t)} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\pi/\\sqrt{k}} \\sqrt{1} dt = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}\n$$\nThese meridional curves are geodesics. This can be seen from the fact that the Christoffel symbol component $\\Gamma_{tt}^k$ for the coordinate system $(t,\\sigma_1,...,\\sigma_{n-1})$ is zero.\nSo, the geodesic distance between $P_S$ and $P_N$ is $d(P_S, P_N) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$. This provides a lower bound for the diameter:\n$$\n\\operatorname{diam}(M^n, g_k) \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}\n$$\nOn the other hand, from Part 2, we showed that $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_k} = (n-1)k g_k$. Since $k>0$, the Ricci curvature is uniformly bounded below by a positive constant. The Bonnet-Myers theorem states that for a complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)k_0 g$ for some constant $k_0>0$, the manifold is compact and its diameter is bounded above by $\\operatorname{diam}(M) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k_0}}$.\nIn our case, $k_0=k$, so we have the upper bound:\n$$\n\\operatorname{diam}(M^n, g_k) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}\n$$\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we conclude that the diameter is exactly\n$$\n\\operatorname{diam}(M^n, g_k) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}\n$$\nThis is the maximal distance between any two points on the manifold, realized by any pair of antipodal points, such as the north and south poles. Geometrically, $(M^n, g_k)$ is isometric to the standard $n$-sphere of radius $R = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}$, whose diameter is $\\pi R$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}}\n$$", "id": "3034329"}]}
