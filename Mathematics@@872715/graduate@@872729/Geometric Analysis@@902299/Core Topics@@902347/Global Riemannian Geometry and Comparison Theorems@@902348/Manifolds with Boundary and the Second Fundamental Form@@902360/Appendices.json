No rounding is required, and no units are involved.", "solution": "The problem is divided into three parts. We will address each in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Computation of the geodesic curvature $k_g$.\n\nLet $M$ be the upper hemisphere of the unit $2$-sphere $S^2$, defined by $S^2 = \\{ (x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1 \\}$ and $M = \\{ (x,y,z) \\in S^2 : z \\ge 0 \\}$. The boundary $\\partial M$ is the equator, a circle $C = \\{ (x,y,z) \\in S^2 : z = 0 \\}$. $M$ is endowed with the Riemannian metric induced from the Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nThe boundary curve $C$ can be parameterized by its arc length $s$. A suitable parameterization is $\\gamma(s) = (\\cos(s), \\sin(s), 0)$ for $s \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The unit tangent vector to the curve $C$ is given by the derivative with respect to arc length:\n$$ T(s) = \\gamma'(s) = (-\\sin(s), \\cos(s), 0) $$\nThe acceleration vector of the curve in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is:\n$$ \\gamma''(s) = (-\\cos(s), -\\sin(s), 0) = -\\gamma(s) $$\nFor any point $p \\in M$, the outward unit normal vector to the surface $M$ is given by the position vector of the point itself, since $M$ is a subset of the unit sphere centered at the origin. So, at a point $p=\\gamma(s)$ on the boundary $C$, the unit normal vector $\\nu$ to the surface $M$ is:\n$$ \\nu(s) = \\gamma(s) = (\\cos(s), \\sin(s), 0) $$\nThe acceleration vector $\\gamma''(s)$ can be decomposed into its component normal to the surface and its component tangent to the surface. The tangential component is the covariant derivative of $T$ along $T$, denoted $\\nabla_T T$.\n$$ \\gamma''(s) = (\\gamma''(s))^{\\perp} + (\\gamma''(s))^{\\top} $$\nwhere $(\\gamma''(s))^{\\perp} = \\langle \\gamma''(s), \\nu(s) \\rangle \\nu(s)$ is the component normal to the surface, and $(\\gamma''(s))^{\\top} = \\nabla_T T$ is the component tangent to the surface.\n\nLet's compute the inner product $\\langle \\gamma''(s), \\nu(s) \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle \\gamma''(s), \\nu(s) \\rangle = \\langle -\\gamma(s), \\gamma(s) \\rangle = -|\\gamma(s)|^2 = -1 $$\nwhere $|\\gamma(s)|=1$ because it lies on the unit sphere.\nNow we can compute the covariant derivative $\\nabla_T T$:\n$$ \\nabla_T T = \\gamma''(s) - \\langle \\gamma''(s), \\nu(s) \\rangle \\nu(s) = -\\gamma(s) - (-1)\\gamma(s) = -\\gamma(s) + \\gamma(s) = 0 $$\nThe geodesic curvature $k_g$ is defined by the relation $\\nabla_T T = k_g n$, where $n$ is the unit co-normal vector, which is tangent to $M$ and orthogonal to $T$. Since $\\nabla_T T = 0$, we have $k_g n = 0$. As $n$ is a unit vector, $|n|=1$, this implies that the geodesic curvature must be zero.\n$$ k_g = 0 $$\nThis result is expected, as the equator $C$ is a great circle on the sphere $S^2$, and great circles are the geodesics of the sphere. By definition, geodesics have zero geodesic curvature.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the quantity $S$.\n\nThe quantity $S$ is defined as:\n$$ S = \\int_{M} K \\, dA + \\int_{\\partial M} k_{g} \\, ds $$\nFrom Part 1, we found that the geodesic curvature $k_g = 0$ along the entire boundary $\\partial M = C$. Therefore, the boundary integral vanishes:\n$$ \\int_{\\partial M} k_{g} \\, ds = \\int_{C} 0 \\, ds = 0 $$\nThe expression for $S$ simplifies to the integral of the Gaussian curvature $K$ over the hemisphere $M$:\n$$ S = \\int_{M} K \\, dA $$\nThe Gaussian curvature $K$ of a sphere of radius $R$ is constant and is given by $K = 1/R^2$. For the unit sphere $S^2$, the radius is $R=1$, so the Gaussian curvature is $K=1$ everywhere on $S^2$, and thus everywhere on $M \\subset S^2$.\nSubstituting $K=1$ into the integral for $S$:\n$$ S = \\int_{M} 1 \\, dA = \\text{Area}(M) $$\nThe manifold $M$ is the upper hemisphere of a unit sphere. The total surface area of a sphere of radius $R$ is $4\\pi R^2$. For the unit sphere ($R=1$), the total area is $4\\pi$. The area of the hemisphere $M$ is half of the total area.\n$$ \\text{Area}(M) = \\frac{1}{2} (4\\pi(1)^2) = 2\\pi $$\nTherefore, the value of $S$ is:\n$$ S = 2\\pi $$\n\nPart 3: Euler characteristic and verification.\n\nThe problem asks to determine the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$ of the hemisphere $M$ and verify the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The manifold $M$ is the closed upper hemisphere, which is topologically equivalent to a closed disk. A closed disk is a contractible space. The Euler characteristic of any contractible space, such as a point or a disk, is $1$. This can be seen by considering a simple triangulation of a disk, for example, a triangle, which has $V=3$ vertices, $E=3$ edges, and $F=1$ face. The Euler characteristic is $\\chi = V - E + F = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1$. So, for the hemisphere $M$:\n$$ \\chi(M) = 1 $$\nThe Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a compact, oriented $2$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with boundary $\\partial M$ states that:\n$$ \\int_{M} K \\, dA + \\int_{\\partial M} k_{g} \\, ds = 2\\pi \\chi(M) $$\nThe left-hand side of this equation is precisely the quantity $S$ we computed in Part 2.\n$$ S = \\int_{M} K \\, dA + \\int_{\\partial M} k_{g} \\, ds = 2\\pi $$\nThe right-hand side of the theorem is:\n$$ 2\\pi \\chi(M) = 2\\pi (1) = 2\\pi $$\nComparing the two sides, we find $2\\pi = 2\\pi$, which verifies the expected relationship given by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for the specific case of the hemisphere.\n\nThe question asks for the final result for $S$.

The Frobenius inner product $\\langle T, \\nu \\otimes X \\rangle$ is given by $\\mathrm{tr}(T^T (\\nu \\otimes X))$. Since $T$ is the identity endomorphism, it is self-adjoint ($T^T=T=\\mathrm{Id}$), so the inner product is $\\mathrm{tr}(\\nu \\otimes X)$.

Since the ambient space is Euclidean, its curvature is zero. Thus, $\\text{Ric}_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(\\nu, \\nu) = 0$.\n2.  **Minimal Hypersurface**: $\\Sigma = B^n \\cap \\{x_n = 0\\}$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional flat disk. Since it is flat, its second fundamental form $A_\\Sigma$ is identically zero, so $|A_\\Sigma|^2 = 0$.\n3.  **Boundary Term**: The boundary of the ambient manifold is $\\partial M = S^{n-1}$. Let $\\eta$ be the outward unit normal to $S^{n-1}$ at a point $p \\in S^{n-1}$. For the unit sphere centered at the origin, $\\eta(p) = p$. The second fundamental form of $S^{n-1}$ is given by $h_{S^{n-1}}(X, Y) = \\langle \\nabla_X \\eta, Y \\rangle$. In Euclidean space, $\\nabla_X \\eta = \\nabla_X p = X$. Therefore, for vectors $X, Y$ tangent to $S^{n-1}$, $h_{S^{n-1}}(X, Y) = \\langle X, Y \\rangle$. The normal to our disk $\\Sigma$ is $\\nu = e_n = (0, \\dots, 0, 1)$. At any point $p \\in \\partial\\Sigma = S^{n-2} \\subset \\{x_n=0\\}$, the position vector is $p=(p_1, \\dots, p_{n-1}, 0)$. The inner product $\\langle \\nu, \\eta(p) \\rangle = \\langle e_n, p \\rangle = 0$, which means that the normal vector $\\nu$ to the disk is tangent to the sphere $S^{n-1}$ at every point along the boundary of the disk. We can thus evaluate $h_{S^{n-1}}(\\nu, \\nu) = \\langle \\nu, \\nu \\rangle = |e_n|^2 = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these components into the index form, we obtain:\n$$ Q(u,u) = \\int_{\\Sigma} |\\nabla_\\Sigma u|^2 dV_\\Sigma - \\int_{\\partial \\Sigma} u^2 dS_{\\partial \\Sigma} $$\n\n### Step 3: The Associated Eigenvalue Problem\nTo find the eigenvalues of the index form, we identify the associated Jacobi operator and boundary condition. Using integration by parts (Green's first identity):\n$$ \\int_{\\Sigma} |\\nabla_\\Sigma u|^2 dV_\\Sigma = \\int_{\\Sigma} u(-\\Delta_\\Sigma u) dV_\\Sigma + \\int_{\\partial \\Sigma} u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\mu} dS_{\\partial \\Sigma} $$\nwhere $\\Delta_\\Sigma$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $\\Sigma$, and $\\mu$ is the outward-pointing unit normal to $\\partial \\Sigma$ within $\\Sigma$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $Q(u,u)$:\n$$ Q(u,u) = \\int_{\\Sigma} u(-\\Delta_\\Sigma u) dV_\\Sigma + \\int_{\\partial \\Sigma} u \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\mu} - u \\right) dS_{\\partial \\Sigma} $$\nThe spectrum of the index form corresponds to the eigenvalue problem for the Jacobi operator $L = -\\Delta_\\Sigma$ with the natural boundary condition that causes the boundary term to vanish. The problem is therefore:\n$$ -\\Delta_\\Sigma u = \\lambda u \\quad \\text{in } \\Sigma $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\mu} = u \\quad \\text{on } \\partial \\Sigma $$\nThe Morse index is the number of negative eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of this boundary value problem.\n\n### Step 4: Spectral Analysis\nWe solve the eigenvalue problem on the $(n-1)$-dimensional disk $\\Sigma = D^{n-1}$. We use separation of variables in polar coordinates, $u(r, \\theta) = R(r) Y_k(\\theta)$, where $Y_k$ is a spherical harmonic of degree $k$ on the sphere $S^{n-2}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\nThe radial part $R(r)$ must satisfy a Bessel-type differential equation, and the boundary condition on $\\partial\\Sigma$ (where $r=1$ and $\\mu = \\partial/\\partial r$) becomes $R'(1) = R(1)$.\n\nWe seek negative eigenvalues, so we set $\\lambda = -\\gamma^2$ for $\\gamma > 0$. The radial equation's regular solution at $r=0$ involves modified Bessel functions of the first kind, $I_\\beta$. The eigenvalue condition becomes an equation relating these functions and their derivatives. A standard analysis shows that this condition simplifies to:\n$$ \\gamma I_{k+(n-1)/2}(\\gamma) = (1-k) I_{k+(n-3)/2}(\\gamma) $$\nWe analyze this condition for non-negative integer values of $k$:\n-   **Case $k=0$**: $\\gamma I_{(n-1)/2}(\\gamma) = I_{(n-3)/2}(\\gamma)$. Let $\\nu = (n-3)/2$. The function $h(\\gamma) = \\gamma \\frac{I_{\\nu+1}(\\gamma)}{I_\\nu(\\gamma)}$ is strictly increasing for $\\gamma > 0$ from $h(0)=0$ to $h(\\infty)=\\infty$, assuming $n \\ge 2$. Therefore, the equation $h(\\gamma)=1$ has exactly one solution $\\gamma_0>0$. This corresponds to one negative eigenvalue. The eigenfunction is radial, so its multiplicity is 1.\n\n-   **Case $k=1$**: $\\gamma I_{(n+1)/2}(\\gamma) = (1-1) I_{(n-1)/2}(\\gamma) = 0$. For $\\gamma>0$, both $\\gamma$ and the modified Bessel function $I_{(n+1)/2}(\\gamma)$ are strictly positive. Thus, there is no solution for $\\gamma>0$. There are no negative eigenvalues for $k=1$.\n\n-   **Case $k \\ge 2$**: The equation is $\\gamma I_{k+(n-1)/2}(\\gamma) = (1-k) I_{k+(n-3)/2}(\\gamma)$. For $\\gamma>0$, the left-hand side is strictly positive. Since $k \\ge 2$, the term $(1-k)$ is negative, so the right-hand side is strictly negative. Thus, there are no solutions for $k \\ge 2$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe analysis shows there is a negative eigenvalue only for the angular mode $k=0$. This eigenvalue is unique and its corresponding eigenspace is one-dimensional (spanned by a radial function). Therefore, the total number of negative eigenvalues, which is the Morse index of the flat disk, is 1.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "3032054"}]}
