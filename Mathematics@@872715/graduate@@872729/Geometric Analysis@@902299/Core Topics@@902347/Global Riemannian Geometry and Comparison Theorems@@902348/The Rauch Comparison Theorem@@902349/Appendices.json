Under these conditions, the curvature term simplifies to:\n$$ R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = k(1 \\cdot J - 0 \\cdot \\dot{\\gamma}) = k J $$\nThe Jacobi equation for a normal Jacobi field $J$ (i.e., $J \\perp \\dot{\\gamma}$) on a space of constant sectional curvature $k$ thus reduces to a much simpler ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ \\frac{D^2 J}{dt^2} + k J = 0 $$\nTo solve this vector ODE, we introduce a parallel orthonormal frame $\\{E_1(t), \\dots, E_{n-1}(t)\\}$ along $\\gamma$ such that each $E_i(t)$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. Any normal Jacobi field $J$ can be written as a linear combination $J(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} y_i(t) E_i(t)$. Since the frame vectors are parallel, their covariant derivatives are zero: $\\frac{D E_i}{dt} = 0$.

The first conjugate time $t_c$ is the infimum of such positive times, which corresponds to $m=1$.\n$$ \\sqrt{k}t_c = \\pi \\implies t_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}} $$\n\nCase 2: The Euclidean case, $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $k = 0$.\nThe ODE is $y'' = 0$. The general solution is $y(t) = A + Bt$.\nThe initial condition $y(0)=0$ implies $A=0$. So, the solution is $y(t) = Bt$.\nFor a non-trivial solution, we need $B \\neq 0$, which corresponds to $y'(0) = B \\neq 0$.\nThe second condition is $y(t_c) = 0$ for some $t_c  0$. This gives $B t_c = 0$.\nSince $B \\neq 0$, this implies $t_c=0$. However, the definition of a conjugate point requires $t_c  0$. Thus, there is no positive time $t_c$ for which a non-trivial Jacobi field vanishes. There are no conjugate points along any geodesic in Euclidean space.\nThe first conjugate time is therefore $t_c = +\\infty$.\n\nCase 3: The hyperbolic case, $\\mathbb{H}^{n}_{k}$ with $k  0$.\nLet us write $k = -\\kappa^2$ where $\\kappa = \\sqrt{-k}  0$. The ODE is $y'' - \\kappa^2 y = 0$.\nThe general solution can be written as $y(t) = A \\cosh(\\kappa t) + B \\sinh(\\kappa t)$.\nThe initial condition $y(0)=0$ implies $A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) = A = 0$. So, the solution must be of the form $y(t) = B \\sinh(\\kappa t)$.\nFor a non-trivial solution, we need $B \\neq 0$, which corresponds to $y'(0) = B\\kappa \\neq 0$.\nThe second condition is $y(t_c) = 0$ for some $t_c  0$. This gives $B \\sinh(\\kappa t_c) = 0$.\nSince $B \\neq 0$, we must have $\\sinh(\\kappa t_c) = 0$. The hyperbolic sine function $\\sinh(x)$ is zero only when its argument $x$ is zero. Thus, we need $\\kappa t_c = 0$.\nSince $\\kappa = \\sqrt{-k}  0$, this implies $t_c=0$. As in the Euclidean case, this does not satisfy the requirement $t_c  0$. There are no conjugate points along any geodesic in hyperbolic space.\nThe first conjugate time is therefore $t_c = +\\infty$.\n\nIn summary, the first conjugate times for the three model spaces are:\n- For $\\mathbb{S}^{n}_{k}$ ($k0$): $t_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$\n- For $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ($k=0$): $t_c = \\infty$\n- For $\\mathbb{H}^{n}_{k}$ ($k0$): $t_c = \\infty$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}  \\infty  \\infty\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3036455"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the behavior of Jacobi fields in constant-curvature spaces, we can now apply the full power of the Rauch Comparison Theorem to a variable-curvature setting.

In our coordinate system, let $X = \\partial/\\partial r$. The formula is $K(X,Y) = -\\frac{1}{f(r)} g_I(\\nabla_X (\\text{grad}_I f), X)$.\nThe base manifold is the real line with metric $g_I=dr^2$. The gradient of the function $f(r)$ on the base is $\\text{grad}_I f = f'(r) (\\partial/\\partial r)$.\nWe compute the covariant derivative: $\\nabla_X (\\text{grad}_I f) = \\nabla_{\\partial/\\partial r} (f'(r) \\partial/\\partial r)$. Since the base is flat, the Christoffel symbols are zero, and the covariant derivative is just the partial derivative of the components, so $\\nabla_{\\partial/\\partial r} (\\partial/\\partial r) = 0$.

The tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\partial/\\partial r$. A radial plane is any plane containing $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. The sectional curvature of such planes, denoted $K_r(t)$, is therefore $K_r(t)|_{r=t} = -f''(t)/f(t)$.\nThe Jacobi equation along a geodesic $\\gamma$ is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. For a normal Jacobi field $J(t)$ (i.e., $g(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))=0$), its length squared is $|J|^2=y^2$. The Jacobi equation for the scalar function $y(t) = |J(t)|$ simplifies to $y''(t) + K(\\sigma(t))y(t) = 0$, where $K(\\sigma(t))$ is the sectional curvature of the plane $\\sigma(t)$ spanned by $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. In our case, this is the radial sectional curvature $K_r(t)$. Thus, the scalar normal Jacobi equation is $y''(t) + K_r(t)y(t)=0$.\n\nNext, we solve this ODE for the given warping function $f(r) = r - ar^3$ and initial conditions $y(0)=0, y'(0)=1$.\nFor a rotationally symmetric manifold, a normal Jacobi field vanishing at the pole $t=0$ has scalar part $y(t)$ given by $y(t) = f(t)$. Let's verify this. We need to check if $y(t)=f(t)$ satisfies the ODE and the initial conditions.\nThe ODE is $y'' + K_r(t)y = 0$, which is $y'' - \\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)} y = 0$.\nIf we substitute $y(t)=f(t)$, we get $f''(t) - \\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)}f(t) = f''(t) - f''(t) = 0$. So $y(t)=f(t)$ is a solution.\nNow we check the initial conditions.\nFrom the problem statement $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$.\nSo, $y(0) = f(0) = 0$, and $y'(0) = f'(0) = 1$. Both initial conditions are satisfied.\nTherefore, the solution to the Jacobi equation with the specified initial conditions is simply the warping function evaluated at $r=t$.\nFor $f(r) = r(1-ar^2)$, the solution is $y(t) = f(t) = t(1-at^2) = t - at^3$.\n\nThe conjugate radius $t_c$ is the first positive time $t0$ where the Jacobi field vanishes, i.e., $y(t_c)=0$.\nWe solve $y(t) = t(1-at^2) = 0$.\nThe solutions are $t=0$ and $1-at^2=0$.\n$1-at^2=0$ implies $t^2 = 1/a$. Since $t$ must be positive, we take the positive root.\nThe first positive zero is $t_c = 1/\\sqrt{a}$.\n\nFinally, we apply the Rauch comparison theorem.\nFirst, we compute the radial sectional curvature $K_r(t)$ for our manifold.\n$f(t) = t - at^3$.\n$f'(t) = 1 - 3at^2$.\n$f''(t) = -6at$.\n$K_r(t) = -\\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)} = -\\frac{-6at}{t - at^3} = \\frac{6at}{t(1-at^2)} = \\frac{6a}{1-at^2}$.\nWe are to compare this to a model space $(\\tilde{M}, \\tilde{g})$ of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa = 6a$.\nFor $t \\in (0, t_c) = (0, 1/\\sqrt{a})$, we have $0  t  1/\\sqrt{a}$, which implies $0  t^2  1/a$, so $0  at^2  1$.\nThis gives $0  1 - at^2  1$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{1}{1-at^2}  1$.\nSince $a0$, we have $K_r(t) = 6a \\left(\\frac{1}{1-at^2}\\right)  6a = \\kappa$.\nSo, the sectional curvature of our manifold $M$ is strictly greater than the curvature of the comparison space $\\tilde{M}$ for all $t \\in (0, t_c)$.\n\nThe Rauch comparison theorem states that if $K_M \\ge K_{\\tilde{M}}$, then the first conjugate point in $M$ occurs no later than the first conjugate point in $\\tilde{M}$. That is, $t_c \\le \\tilde{t}_c$.\nLet's find the conjugate radius $\\tilde{t}_c$ for the constant curvature space.

We must have $\\sin(\\sqrt{6a}\\tilde{t}_c) = 0$, which means $\\sqrt{6a}\\tilde{t}_c = \\pi$.\nThis gives $\\tilde{t}_c = \\pi/\\sqrt{6a}$.\n\nThe Rauch theorem predicts $t_c \\le \\tilde{t}_c$, which is $1/\\sqrt{a} \\le \\pi/\\sqrt{6a}$.\nThis inequality simplifies to $1 \\le \\pi/\\sqrt{6}$, or $\\sqrt{6} \\le \\pi$.\nSquaring both sides gives $6 \\le \\pi^2$. Since $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$, so the inequality $6 \\le \\pi^2$ is true. This confirms the theorem's application.\nThe physical interpretation of this inequality is that a region of higher curvature focuses geodesics more strongly. Since $K_r(t)  \\kappa$, our manifold is more curved along the geodesic path than the comparison space. This stronger focusing causes geodesics emanating from the pole to reconverge faster, leading to a smaller conjugate radius ($t_c  \\tilde{t}_c$).\n\nThe problem asks for the single analytic expression of the conjugate radius $t_c$ as a function of $a$. This was found to be $t_c = 1/\\sqrt{a}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}}$$", "id": "3036482"}]}
