In this problem, $M = N = S^2$, the unit two-dimensional sphere, and $g$ and $h$ are the standard round metric on $S^2$.

Substituting this into the degree formula gives:\n$$\\int_{S^2} J(u) \\, d\\mu_g = 4\\pi k$$\n\nThe core of the derivation is a pointwise inequality relating $|du|^2$ and $J(u)$. Let $p \\in S^2$. The differential $du_p: T_pS^2 \\to T_{u(p)}S^2$ is a linear map between two-dimensional inner product spaces. Let $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ be the singular values of $du_p$. These are non-negative real numbers. In a suitable choice of orthonormal bases for $T_pS^2$ and $T_{u(p)}S^2$, the matrix representation of $du_p$ is diagonal with entries $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$.\nThe Hilbert-Schmidt norm squared is the sum of squares of the singular values:\n$$|du_p|^2 = \\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2$$\nThe Jacobian determinant is the product of the singular values, up to a sign depending on orientation:\n$$|J(u)_p| = \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2$$\nBy the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality, or by noting that $(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 \\ge 0$, we have $\\sigma_1^2 - 2\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 + \\sigma_2^2 \\ge 0$, which implies $\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2 \\ge 2\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$.

If $k  0$, we must have $J(u) \\ge 0$, meaning the map is orientation-preserving. If $k  0$, we must have $J(u) \\le 0$, meaning the map is orientation-reversing. If $k=0$, the bound is $0$, which is trivially achieved by any constant map ($du=0$).\n\nThus, the energy bound $E(u) = 4\\pi|k|$ is achieved if and only if $u$ is a conformal map that is orientation-preserving (for $k0$) or orientation-reversing (for $k0$).\n\nThis result connects directly to the theory of harmonic maps. A harmonic map is a critical point of the energy functional $E(u)$. The Euler-Lagrange equation for this functional is $\\tau(u) = 0$, where $\\tau(u)$ is the tension field of the map. Any map that minimizes energy within its homotopy class must necessarily be a harmonic map. Our derivation shows that $4\\pi|k|$ is the infimum of the energy for all maps of degree $k$. If there exists a map $u_k$ of degree $k$ such that $E(u_k) = 4\\pi|k|$, then this map must be an energy-minimizing map in its homotopy class, and therefore must be harmonic.\n\nFor maps from the sphere $S^2$ to itself (or more generally from any Riemann surface to a Kähler manifold), it is a fundamental result that conformal maps are harmonic.\nIdentifying $S^2$ with the Riemann sphere $\\mathbb{C} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$, the conditions for equality are met by specific classes of maps:\n- For $k  0$, any rational function $f(z) = P(z)/Q(z)$ of degree $k$ is a holomorphic map from $\\mathbb{C} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ to itself. Holomorphic maps are conformal and orientation-preserving. The topological degree of such a map is precisely $k$.\n- For $k  0$, the complex conjugate of a rational function of degree $|k|$, for example $\\overline{f(z)}$, is an anti-holomorphic map. These maps are conformal and orientation-reversing, and they have topological degree $k$.\n- For $k=0$, a constant map is harmonic and has energy $0$.\n\nSince these maps (rational functions and their conjugates) exist for every integer degree $k$ and satisfy the conditions for equality, they are the energy-minimizing harmonic representatives in their respective homotopy classes.

A key consequence of flatness is that the Christoffel symbols vanish in the standard Cartesian coordinates. Let $(x^1, x^2)$ be the coordinates on the universal cover $\\mathbb{R}^2$ of $M$, and let $F = (F^1, F^2, F^3)$ be the coordinate representation of a lift of $f$ to the universal covers, $F: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$.

The fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, generated by loops corresponding to the basis vectors $e_1 = (1,0)$ and $e_2 = (0,1)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The homomorphism $\\rho: \\pi_1(M) \\to \\pi_1(N)$ maps these generators according to the matrix $A$.

Such a map is always harmonic as its second derivatives are zero, so $\\Delta L = 0$. This implies we must have $\\Delta P = 0$. Since $P$ is periodic, it descends to a map from the compact torus $M$ to $\\mathbb{R}^3$. By the maximum principle, a harmonic function on a compact manifold without boundary must be constant. Therefore, each component of $P$ must be constant, meaning $P(x)$ is a constant vector.\n\nThus, any harmonic lift $F$ must be an affine map:\n$$\nF(x^1, x^2) = B \\begin{pmatrix} x^1 \\\\ x^2 \\end{pmatrix} + c\n$$\nfor some $B \\in \\mathrm{Mat}_{3\\times 2}(\\mathbb{R})$ and $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nWe apply the quasi-periodicity conditions to this affine form. For $v = e_1 = (1,0)$:\n$$\nF(x+e_1) - F(x) = (B(x+e_1)+c) - (Bx+c) = Be_1\n$$\nThis must equal $Ae_1$. Similarly, for $v=e_2=(0,1)$, we find $Be_2=Ae_2$. Since this must hold for the basis vectors, we must have $B=A$.\n\nSo, any harmonic lift must be of the form:\n$$\nF_c(x) = A x + c = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x^1 \\\\ x^2 \\end{pmatrix} + c\n$$\nfor some constant vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nEach such lift $F_c$ projects to a harmonic map $f_c: M \\to N$. We now determine the space of such maps. Two different lifts, $F_{c_1}$ and $F_{c_2}$, project to the same map on the tori if and only if their values are congruent modulo the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n$$\nF_{c_1}(x) \\equiv F_{c_2}(x) \\pmod{\\mathbb{Z}^3} \\implies Ax + c_1 \\equiv Ax + c_2 \\pmod{\\mathbb{Z}^3}\n$$\nThis simplifies to $c_1 - c_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3$.\nTherefore, the set of distinct harmonic maps in the given homotopy class is parametrized by the choice of the constant vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ modulo the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^3$. This parameter space is precisely the target torus:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_A = \\{f_c: M \\to N\\} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3/\\mathbb{Z}^3 = N\n$$\nThe problem asks for the dimension $d$ of this set of harmonic maps. Since the set is diffeomorphic to the target manifold $N$, its dimension is the dimension of $N$. The manifold $N = \\mathbb{R}^3/\\mathbb{Z}^3$ is the $3$-dimensional torus.\n\nThus, the dimension of the set of harmonic maps is $3$.\n\nWe can also interpret this through the action of the target torus on a fixed harmonic map. Let $f_0$ be the harmonic map corresponding to $c=0$, with lift $F_0(x) = Ax$. Any other harmonic map $f_c$ in the same homotopy class is given by the lift $F_c(x) = Ax+c$. Projecting to the torus $N$, this corresponds to post-composition by a translation:\n$$\nf_c([x]) = [F_c(x)] = [Ax+c] = [Ax] + [c] = f_0([x]) + [c]\n$$\nwhere $[x] \\in M$ and $[c] \\in N$, and the addition is the group operation on the torus $N$. The group of translations on $N$ is isomorphic to $N$ itself, which is a compact Lie group of dimension $3$. The set of harmonic maps in the specified homotopy class is the orbit of $f_0$ under the action of this group of translations. This orbit is diffeomorphic to the group itself. Therefore, the dimension of the set of harmonic maps is $\\dim(N) = 3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "3034994"}]}
