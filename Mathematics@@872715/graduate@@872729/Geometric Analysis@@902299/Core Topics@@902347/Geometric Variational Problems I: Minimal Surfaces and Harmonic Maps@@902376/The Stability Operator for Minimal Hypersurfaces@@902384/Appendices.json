The solution must adhere to the conventions established in the main text.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Stability Operator $L$\n\nThe general stability operator $L$ for a minimal hypersurface $\\Sigma^k \\subset M^{k+1}$, as defined in the main text, acts on smooth functions $f$ on $\\Sigma$ and is given by the formula:\n$$\nL(f) = -\\Delta_{\\Sigma}f - (|A|^2 + \\operatorname{Ric}_M(\\nu, \\nu))f\n$$\nHere, $-\\Delta_{\\Sigma}$ is the negative of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $\\Sigma$ (a non-negative operator), $A$ is the second fundamental form, $|A|^2$ is its squared norm, $\\operatorname{Ric}_M$ is the Ricci curvature tensor of the ambient manifold $M$, and $\\nu$ is a unit normal vector field to $\\Sigma$.\n\nWe apply this formula to the specific case:\n1.  The hypersurface is $\\Sigma = S^{n-1}$ embedded as a **totally geodesic** equator in $M = S^n$. By definition, this means its second fundamental form is identically zero, so $|A|^2 = 0$.\n\n2.  The ambient manifold is the unit $n$-sphere $S^n$. A space of constant sectional curvature $K=1$ has a Ricci curvature tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}_{S^n} = (n-1)g_{S^n}$. For the unit normal vector $\\nu$ to $\\Sigma$, we have $\\operatorname{Ric}_{S^n}(\\nu, \\nu) = n-1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formula for $L$ gives the explicit form of the operator for the equator $\\Sigma = S^{n-1}$:\n$$\nL(f) = -\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}f - (0 + (n-1))f = -\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}f - (n-1)f\n$$\nThus, the operator is $L = -\\Delta_{S^{n-1}} - (n-1)I$, where $I$ is the identity operator.\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of the Spectral Value\n\nTo find the eigenvalues of $L$, we need the spectrum of the operator $-\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}$ on the standard unit $(n-1)$-sphere. Its eigenvalues are given by:\n$$\n\\lambda_k = k(k+n-2) \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\nIf $\\phi_k$ is an eigenfunction of $-\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$, we can apply $L$ to it:\n$$\nL(\\phi_k) = (-\\Delta_{S^{n-1}})\\phi_k - (n-1)\\phi_k = \\lambda_k\\phi_k - (n-1)\\phi_k = (\\lambda_k - (n-1))\\phi_k\n$$\nThis shows that the eigenvalues of $L$, which we denote by $\\mu_k$, are related to the eigenvalues of $-\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}$ by $\\mu_k = \\lambda_k - (n-1)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the spectral value of $L$ for eigenfunctions \"arising from the lowest eigenvalue of $\\Delta_{\\Sigma}$\". The spectrum of $\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}$ is $\\{-\\lambda_k\\}_{k=0}^\\infty$. The lowest eigenvalue (in magnitude) is 0, which corresponds to $k=0$ in the formula for $\\lambda_k$. The eigenfunctions for $k=0$ (i.e., for $\\lambda_0=0$) are the constant functions on $S^{n-1}$.\n\nFor these constant eigenfunctions, the corresponding eigenvalue of $L$ is $\\mu_0$:\n$$\n\\mu_0 = \\lambda_0 - (n-1) = 0 - (n-1) = -(n-1)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the \"smallest spectral value of $L$ among\" this class of eigenfunctions. Since the eigenspace for $\\lambda_0=0$ corresponds to a single eigenvalue $\\mu_0=-(n-1)$ for $L$, this value is trivially the smallest (and only) one in that class.\n\n### Step 3: Stability Analysis\n\nA minimal hypersurface is **stable** if and only if the lowest eigenvalue of its stability operator $L$ is non-negative ($\\lambda_1(L) \\ge 0$). The lowest eigenvalue of $L$ corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue of $-\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}$, which is $\\lambda_0=0$. This gives the eigenvalue $\\mu_0 = -(n-1)$ for $L$.\nSince $n \\ge 2$ for the equator $S^{n-1}$ to be defined in $S^n$, this eigenvalue is negative: $\\mu_0  0$.

We analyze the quadratic form $Q(f)$ which is the Rayleigh quotient for $L$. For a Fourier mode $f_k(u,v) = \\phi_k(v)e^{iku}$:\n$$\nQ(f_k) = \\int_{\\Sigma} \\left( |\\nabla f_k|^2 - |A|^2 f_k^2 \\right) d\\mu\n$$\nWe have $|\\nabla f_k|^2 = g^{ij}\\partial_i f_k \\partial_j \\bar{f_k} = \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(v)}\\left(|\\partial_u f_k|^2 + |\\partial_v f_k|^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(v)}\\left(k^2\\phi_k^2 + (\\phi_k')^2\\right)$.\nThe area element is $d\\mu = \\sqrt{EG-F^2}dudv = \\cosh^2(v)dudv$.\nThe integral becomes:\n\\begin{align*}\nQ(f_k) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(v)}(k^2\\phi_k^2 + (\\phi_k')^2) - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^4(v)}\\phi_k^2 \\right] \\cosh^2(v) dv du \\\\\n= 2\\pi \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( (\\phi_k')^2 + k^2\\phi_k^2 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}\\phi_k^2 \\right) dv \\\\\n= 2\\pi \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( (\\phi_k')^2 + \\left(k^2 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}\\right)\\phi_k^2 \\right) dv\n\\end{align*}\nThis quadratic form is associated with the one-dimensional Schrödinger operator $L_k = -\\frac{d^2}{dv^2} + V_k(v)$, where the potential is $V_k(v) = k^2 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}$. The Morse index is the total number of negative eigenvalues of the operators $L_k$ for all integer values of $k$, counting multiplicities. Note that for $k \\ne 0$, the modes $e^{iku}$ and $e^{-iku}$ (or $\\cos(ku)$ and $\\sin(ku)$ in real form) are distinct, so each negative eigenvalue for $k > 0$ contributes $2$ to the index.\n\nThe potential in $L_k$ is a shifted Pöschl-Teller potential. Let's analyze the spectrum of the base operator $H = -\\frac{d^2}{dv^2} - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}$. This corresponds to the Pöschl-Teller potential $V(v) = -s(s+1)/\\cosh^2(v)$ with $s(s+1) = 2$, which gives $s=1$ (taking $s>0$). The discrete spectrum of such an operator is given by $E_n = -(s-n)^2$ for $n=0, 1, \\dots, \\lfloor s \\rfloor$. With $s=1$, the only allowed value is $n=0$, giving a single bound state with eigenvalue $E_0 = -(1-0)^2 = -1$.\n\nThe operator for the $k$-th mode is $L_k = H + k^2$. Its eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of $H$ shifted by $k^2$. The lowest eigenvalue of $L_k$ is therefore $\\epsilon_{k,0} = E_0 + k^2 = -1 + k^2$. The continuous spectrum of $L_k$ starts from $k^2$.\n\nWe need to find for which integer values of $k$ the lowest eigenvalue $\\epsilon_{k,0}$ is negative:\n$$\n-1 + k^2  0 \\implies k^2  1\n$$\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the only value that satisfies this inequality is $k=0$.\n\nFor $k=0$: The operator is $L_0 = -\\frac{d^2}{dv^2} - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}$. Its lowest eigenvalue is $\\epsilon_{0,0} = -1 + 0^2 = -1$. This is a negative eigenvalue. The mode is independent of $u$ (radially symmetric), so it corresponds to a single eigenfunction. This contributes $1$ to the Morse index.\n\nFor $|k|=1$: The operator is $L_1 = -\\frac{d^2}{dv^2} + 1 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}$. Its lowest eigenvalue is $\\epsilon_{1,0} = -1 + 1^2 = 0$. Since the lowest eigenvalue is zero and the rest of the spectrum is positive (the continuous part starts at $1^2=1$), there are no negative eigenvalues for this mode. Jacobi fields (eigenfunctions with eigenvalue $0$) do not contribute to the Morse index.\n\nFor $|k| \\ge 2$: The operator is $L_k = -\\frac{d^2}{dv^2} + k^2 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}$. Its lowest eigenvalue is $\\epsilon_{k,0} = -1 + k^2 \\ge -1 + 4 = 3  0$. There are no negative eigenvalues for these modes.\n\nSumming up the contributions from all modes, only the $k=0$ mode yields a negative eigenvalue. There is exactly one such eigenvalue.
