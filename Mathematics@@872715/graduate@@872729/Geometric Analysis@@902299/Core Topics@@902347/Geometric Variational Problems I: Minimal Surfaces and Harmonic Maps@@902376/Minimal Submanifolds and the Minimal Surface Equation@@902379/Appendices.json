It is a standard exercise in the calculus of variations and its application to the differential geometry of minimal surfaces.\n\nThe first task is to derive the Euler–Lagrange equation for the area functional $\\mathcal{A}[u]$. This functional represents the area of the surface defined by the graph of a function $u(x,y)$ over a domain $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. The functional is given by\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}[u] = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u(x,y)|^{2}} \\, dx\\,dy.\n$$\nThis is an integral of the form $\\int_{\\Omega} L(\\nabla u) \\, dx\\,dy$, where $L$ is the Lagrangian, which depends only on the partial derivatives of $u$.

Recognizing that the gradient of $u$ is the vector $\\nabla u = (u_x, u_y)$ and its squared norm is $|\\nabla u|^2 = u_x^2 + u_y^2$, we can write the vector field inside the derivatives as $\\frac{\\nabla u}{\\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u|^2}}$.

The fundamental group $\\pi_1(\\Sigma)$ is generated by a single loop $\\gamma$ enclosing the origin, which we can take as a positively oriented unit circle. The periods are calculated using the residue theorem: $\\oint_\\gamma f(z) dz = 2\\pi i \\operatorname{Res}(f, 0)$.\n\nLet's compute the components of the period vector $\\Pi = (P_1, P_2, P_3)$:\n- $P_1 = \\oint_\\gamma \\phi_1 = \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\oint_\\gamma (\\alpha^{-1} z^{-2m} - \\alpha) dz$. The integrand is a Laurent series. A non-zero residue exists only if a term has power $z^{-1}$. The term $-\\alpha$ is constant. The term $\\alpha^{-1} z^{-2m}$ has a non-zero residue only if $-2m = -1$, which is impossible for an integer $m$. Thus, $P_1 = 0$ for all $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n- $P_2 = \\oint_\\gamma \\phi_2 = \\frac{i\\beta}{2} \\oint_\\gamma (\\alpha^{-1} z^{-2m} + \\alpha) dz$. By the same reasoning as for $P_1$, $P_2 = 0$ for all $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n- $P_3 = \\oint_\\gamma \\phi_3 = \\beta \\oint_\\gamma z^{-m} dz$. This integral is non-zero if and only if $-m = -1$, which implies $m=1$. If $m=1$, the integrand is $\\beta z^{-1}$ and $\\operatorname{Res}(\\beta z^{-1}, 0) = \\beta$. The period is $P_3 = 2\\pi i \\beta$. If $m \\neq 1$, $P_3 = 0$.\n\nIf $m \\neq 1$, the period vector $\\Pi$ is $(0, 0, 0)$, so the closing condition $\\operatorname{Re}(\\Pi)=0$ is trivially satisfied. This would correspond to a minimal surface of finite topology that can be extended across the puncture $z=0$. The catenoid, however, is a surface of infinite topology with two ends, corresponding to $z \\to 0$ and $z \\to \\infty$. A characteristic of these ends is a non-zero period of the height differential, which provides the translational symmetry of the surface. A zero period vector would not produce a catenoid.\n\nTherefore, we must have $m=1$, which yields a non-trivial period vector $\\Pi = (0, 0, 2\\pi i \\beta)$.\nThe period closing condition is $\\operatorname{Re}(\\Pi) = \\operatorname{Re}(0, 0, 2\\pi i \\beta) = (0, 0, 0)$.\nLet $\\beta = \\beta_R + i \\beta_I$ where $\\beta_R, \\beta_I \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $\\operatorname{Re}(2\\pi i \\beta) = \\operatorname{Re}(2\\pi i (\\beta_R + i \\beta_I)) = \\operatorname{Re}(2\\pi i \\beta_R - 2\\pi \\beta_I) = -2\\pi \\beta_I$.\nThe condition $-2\\pi \\beta_I = 0$ implies $\\beta_I = 0$. Thus, $\\beta$ must be a real number, $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $\\beta \\neq 0$, we have $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Regularity Condition**\nA branch point would occur if the metric induced by the immersion degenerates. The metric is $ds^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(|g|^{-1}+|g|)^2 |h'|^2 |dz|^2$, where $h'(z) = \\beta z^{-m}$.\nSubstituting the data, the metric coefficient is $\\frac{1}{4}(|\\alpha z^m|^{-1} + |\\alpha z^m|)^2 |\\beta z^{-m}|^2$. Since $\\alpha, \\beta, z$ are all non-zero in $\\Sigma$, this coefficient is strictly positive and finite. Thus, there are no branch points in $\\Sigma = \\mathbb{C}^*$.\n\nThe term \"regularity\" for a specific surface like the catenoid also implies having the correct end structure. A catenoid has two embedded ends. In the Weierstrass representation, this typically requires that at a puncture corresponding to an end, the Gauss map function $g$ has a simple pole or zero, and the height differential function $h'$ has a simple zero or pole, respectively.\nWith our data, at $z=0$:\n- $g(z) = \\alpha z^m$. For $m0$, this is a zero of order $m$. For $m0$, it's a pole of order $|m|$.\n- $h'(z) = \\beta z^{-m}$. For $m0$, this is a pole of order $m$. For $m0$, it's a zero of order $|m|$.\n\nThe structure of an embedded end requires the orders to be simple, i.e., $m=1$ or $m=-1$. As established in Step 1, the requirement of a non-trivial height period already forced $m=1$. The case $m=-1$ corresponds to the same surface up to an isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so we proceed with $m=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Normalization of $\\alpha$**\nThe Weierstrass representation is subject to certain invariances. A reparametrization of the domain $w = c z$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{C}^*$ leaves the geometric surface unchanged.\nLet's apply the reparametrization $w = \\alpha z$ (since $\\alpha \\neq 0$). Then $z=w/\\alpha$ and $dz = dw/\\alpha$.\nThe new Weierstrass data $(g', dh')$ in the $w$-coordinate are:\n- $g'(w) = g(z(w)) = \\alpha (w/\\alpha)^m = \\alpha^{1-m} w^m$.\n- $dh'(w) = \\beta (z(w))^{-m} dz(w) = \\beta (w/\\alpha)^{-m} (dw/\\alpha) = \\beta \\alpha^m \\alpha^{-1} w^{-m} dw = (\\beta \\alpha^{m-1}) w^{-m} dw$.\n\nFor our case $m=1$:\n- $g'(w) = \\alpha^{1-1} w^1 = w$.\n- $dh'(w) = (\\beta \\alpha^{1-1}) w^{-1} dw = \\beta w^{-1} dw$.\nThis procedure transforms the parameter $\\alpha$ to $1$ while leaving $\\beta$ unchanged. Thus, without loss of generality, we can set $\\alpha=1$.\n\n**Step 4: Final determination of $\\beta$**\nWe now have $m=1$, $\\alpha=1$, and $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The Weierstrass data are $g(z)=z$ and $dh=\\beta z^{-1}dz$. Let's compute the immersion to fix $\\beta$.\nThe 1-forms are:\n$\\phi_1 = \\frac{\\beta}{2}(z^{-2}-1)dz$, $\\phi_2 = \\frac{i\\beta}{2}(z^{-2}+1)dz$, $\\phi_3 = \\beta z^{-1}dz$.\nIntegrating from a base point $z_0=1$ to $z=re^{i\\theta}$:\n$X_1(z) = \\operatorname{Re} \\int_1^z \\phi_1 = \\operatorname{Re} \\left[ \\frac{\\beta}{2}(-z^{-1}-z) \\right]_1^z = \\operatorname{Re} \\left[ \\frac{\\beta}{2}(-z^{-1}-z+2) \\right]$.\n$X_2(z) = \\operatorname{Re} \\int_1^z \\phi_2 = \\operatorname{Re} \\left[ \\frac{i\\beta}{2}(-z^{-1}+z) \\right]_1^z = \\operatorname{Re} \\left[ \\frac{i\\beta}{2}(-z^{-1}+z) \\right]$.\n$X_3(z) = \\operatorname{Re} \\int_1^z \\phi_3 = \\operatorname{Re} \\left[ \\beta \\ln z \\right]_1^z = \\operatorname{Re}[\\beta \\ln z] = \\beta \\ln r$.\n\nLet us write the coordinates explicitly, ignoring the constant shift from the base point which only translates the surface:\n$X_1 = \\operatorname{Re}\\left[-\\frac{\\beta}{2}(r^{-1}e^{-i\\theta} + re^{i\\theta})\\right] = -\\frac{\\beta}{2}(r^{-1}+r)\\cos\\theta = -\\beta \\cosh(\\ln r) \\cos\\theta$.\n$X_2 = \\operatorname{Re}\\left[-\\frac{i\\beta}{2}(r^{-1}e^{-i\\theta} - re^{i\\theta})\\right] = \\operatorname{Re}\\left[-\\frac{i\\beta}{2}((r^{-1}-r)\\cos\\theta - i(r^{-1}+r)\\sin\\theta)\\right] = -\\frac{\\beta}{2}(r^{-1}+r)\\sin\\theta = -\\beta \\cosh(\\ln r) \\sin\\theta$.\n$X_3 = \\beta \\ln r$.\n\nThe surface is one of revolution around the $X_3$-axis. The radius of a horizontal circle at a given height $X_3$ is $R = \\sqrt{X_1^2+X_2^2} = \\sqrt{\\beta^2 \\cosh^2(\\ln r)(\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta)} = |\\beta| \\cosh(\\ln r)$.\nFrom $X_3 = \\beta \\ln r$, we have $\\ln r = X_3/\\beta$.\nSo, the profile curve of the catenoid is $R = |\\beta| \\cosh(X_3/\\beta)$.\nThe waist of the catenoid occurs at the minimum radius, which is when the argument of $\\cosh$ is zero, i.e., $X_3=0$.\nThe waist radius is $R_{waist} = |\\beta| \\cosh(0) = |\\beta|$.\nThe problem requires the waist radius to be $1$. Therefore, $|\\beta|=1$.\nSince we've already established that $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we must have $\\beta = 1$ or $\\beta = -1$. Both choices yield the same geometric surface (up to a reflection across the $z=0$ plane). We choose the conventional value $\\beta=1$.\n\nThe final parameter triple is $(m, \\alpha, \\beta) = (1, 1, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3032216"}]}
