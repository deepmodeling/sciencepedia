Let $\\phi \\in C^{\\infty}_{c}(M)$ be a nonnegative cutoff function supported in a geodesic ball. In the localization step of Yau's gradient estimate for harmonic functions, one studies the quantity $Q = \\phi^{2} |\\nabla f|^{2}$ and expands $\\Delta Q$ using the product rule together with the Bochner formula. A key component of this expansion is a mixed term of the form $\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla \\phi^{2} \\rangle$, which must be controlled in a way that can be absorbed into dominant positive terms via an $\\varepsilon$-inequality.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of the gradient, the pointwise inner product, and the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, and using Young's inequality with a parameter $\\varepsilon > 0$, derive an upper bound for the absolute value $|\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla \\phi^{2} \\rangle|$ that is suitable for absorption in the sense of Yau's method.

The gradient operator $\\nabla$ satisfies the Leibniz rule for the product of two smooth functions $h_1, h_2 \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$: $\\nabla(h_1 h_2) = h_1 \\nabla h_2 + h_2 \\nabla h_1$.

The pointwise inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ induced by the metric $g$ is bilinear. Since $\\phi$ is a scalar function, we can factor out the term $2\\phi$:\n    $$\n    \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla \\phi^{2} \\rangle = \\langle \\nabla f, 2\\phi \\nabla \\phi \\rangle = 2\\phi \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla \\phi \\rangle\n    $$\n\n3.  **Taking the Absolute Value**: The problem asks for a bound on the absolute value. Since the function $\\phi$ is given as nonnegative, we have $|\\phi| = \\phi$.\n    $$\n    |\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla \\phi^{2} \\rangle| = |2\\phi \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla \\phi \\rangle| = 2\\phi |\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla \\phi \\rangle|\n    $$\n\n4.  **Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality**: For any two 1-forms (or vector fields) $X$ and $Y$ on $M$, the pointwise Cauchy–Schwarz inequality states that $|\\langle X, Y \\rangle| \\le |X| |Y|$, where $|X| = \\sqrt{\\langle X, X \\rangle}$ is the pointwise norm.

Subject to the constraint $AB=1$ for positive $A$ and $B$, the sum $A+B$ is minimized when $A=B=1$. This choice represents the most \"balanced\" distribution of the inequality's power and is the standard selection in this context. Choosing $A=1$ yields $B=1$. These are the smallest positive integers satisfying the constraint.\n\n6.  **Final Bound**: Setting $A=1$ and $B=1$ (and thus $\\delta = \\varepsilon$) in our derived inequality, we have:\n    $$\n    2\\phi |\\nabla f| |\\nabla \\phi| \\le \\varepsilon \\phi^2 |\\nabla f|^2 + \\varepsilon^{-1} |\\nabla \\phi|^2\n    $$\n    Since we established that $|\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla \\phi^{2} \\rangle| \\le 2\\phi |\\nabla f| |\\nabla \\phi|$, we arrive at the final upper bound:\n    $$\n    |\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla \\phi^{2} \\rangle| \\le \\varepsilon \\phi^{2} |\\nabla f|^{2} + \\varepsilon^{-1} |\\nabla \\phi|^{2}\n    $$\n    This expression matches the required form with $A=1$ and $B=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\varepsilon \\phi^{2} |\\nabla f|^{2} + \\varepsilon^{-1} |\\nabla \\phi|^{2}}$$", "id": "3037391"}, {"introduction": "A fundamental question to ask of any inequality in mathematics is whether it is \"sharp,\" meaning its constants cannot be improved.

We are given that the Busemann function $b_{\\xi}(x)$ satisfies $|\\nabla b_{\\xi}| = 1$ and $\\Delta b_{\\xi} = (n-1)\\kappa$.\n\nFirst, we will demonstrate that $u$ is a positive harmonic function. A function is harmonic if its Laplacian is zero. We use the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula for the Laplacian of a composite function $G(f(x))$, which is a general chain rule:\n$$\n\\Delta(G(f)) = G''(f) |\\nabla f|^2 + G'(f) \\Delta f\n$$\nIn our case, $G(y) = \\exp(y)$, so its derivatives are $G'(y) = \\exp(y)$ and $G''(y) = \\exp(y)$.

Using the linearity of the Laplacian operator:\n$$\n\\Delta f = \\Delta\\left(-(n-1)\\kappa b_{\\xi}\\right) = -(n-1)\\kappa \\Delta b_{\\xi}\n$$\nWe are given that $\\Delta b_{\\xi} = (n-1)\\kappa$.

Because the exponential function and the real-valued function $b_{\\xi}(x)$ produce a positive output, $u(x) = \\exp(-(n-1)\\kappa b_{\\xi}(x)) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\\kappa}$. Thus, $u$ is a positive harmonic function.\n\nSecond, we compute the pointwise ratio $|\\nabla u|/u$.

Therefore, the ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\nabla u|}{u} = |\\nabla f|\n$$\nWe have already computed $|\\nabla f|^2 = (n-1)^2 \\kappa^2$.

For a complete Riemannian manifold $(M^n, g)$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below by $\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge -(n-1)K g$ for some constant $K \\ge 0$, Yau's estimate for any positive harmonic function $u$ on $M$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\nabla u|}{u} \\le (n-1)\\sqrt{K}\n$$\nThe space $\\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\\kappa}$ has constant sectional curvature $-\\kappa^2$. The Ricci curvature tensor of a space with constant sectional curvature $C$ is given by $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)Cg$. For $\\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\\kappa}$, we have $C = -\\kappa^2$, so its Ricci curvature is exactly:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_{\\kappa}} = -(n-1)\\kappa^2 g_{\\kappa}\n$$\nComparing this with the lower bound form $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_{\\kappa}} \\ge -(n-1)K g_{\\kappa}$, we have:\n$$\n-(n-1)\\kappa^2 g_{\\kappa} \\ge -(n-1)K g_{\\kappa}\n$$\nThis implies $\\kappa^2 \\le K$. The sharpest (i.e., largest) lower bound corresponds to choosing the smallest possible $K$, which is $K = \\kappa^2$.\nWith $K = \\kappa^2$, Yau's gradient estimate for any positive harmonic function $u$ on $\\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\\kappa}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\nabla u|}{u} \\le (n-1)\\sqrt{\\kappa^2} = (n-1)\\kappa\n$$\nOur computation for the specific function $u(x) = \\exp(-(n-1)\\kappa b_{\\xi}(x))$ yielded the result $\\frac{|\\nabla u|}{u} = (n-1)\\kappa$.

Actual: $e^\\lambda\\cos(\\lambda x)$. These are not equal for $\\lambda \\ge 1$.\n\nThe proposed function $u_\\lambda$ does not satisfy the boundary conditions ascribed to it. Therefore, the construction as stated is not rigorous or self-consistent.\n\nEven if we were to disregard the contradictory claim about boundary data and analyze the function $u_\\lambda(x,t) = e^{\\lambda t}\\cos(\\lambda x)$ on its own merits, it would still fail to be a valid counterexample. While this function is harmonic ($\\Delta u_\\lambda = \\frac{\\partial^2 u_\\lambda}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_\\lambda}{\\partial t^2} = -\\lambda^2 e^{\\lambda t}\\cos(\\lambda x) + \\lambda^2 e^{\\lambda t}\\cos(\\lambda x) = 0$), its boundary values are $u_\\lambda|_{\\partial M} = \\{\\cos(\\lambda x) \\text{ on } \\mathbb{S}^1\\times\\{0\\}, e^\\lambda\\cos(\\lambda x) \\text{ on } \\mathbb{S}^1\\times\\{1\\}\\}$. The $L^\\infty$-norm of this boundary data is $\\|u_\\lambda|_{\\partial M}\\|_{L^\\infty} = \\max(1, e^\\lambda) = e^\\lambda$. This is not uniformly bounded as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$, which violates a crucial condition for the counterexample.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3037416"}]}
