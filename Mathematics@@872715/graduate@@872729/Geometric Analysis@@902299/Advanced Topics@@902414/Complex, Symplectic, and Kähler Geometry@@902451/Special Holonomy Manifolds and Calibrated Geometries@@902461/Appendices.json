This first exercise provides a foundational calculation, anchoring the abstract theory in the concrete and familiar setting of a Riemann surface.

It is scientifically grounded in differential geometry, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\nLet $\\Sigma$ be a connected complex one-dimensional manifold, which is equivalent to a connected real two-dimensional manifold (a surface). At any point $x \\in \\Sigma$, the tangent space $T_x\\Sigma$ is a one-dimensional complex vector space and thus a two-dimensional real vector space. The holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{x}(\\nabla)$ at a point $x$ is a subgroup of the general linear group of the tangent space, $\\mathrm{GL}(T_x\\Sigma)$.\n\nThe problem states that the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ of the metric $g$ preserves $g$, i.e., $\\nabla g = 0$. This fundamental property implies that parallel transport along any piecewise smooth loop based at $x$ is an isometry of the tangent space $T_x\\Sigma$. Consequently, the holonomy group is a subgroup of the orthogonal group of $T_x\\Sigma$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathrm{O}(2)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_{x}(\\nabla) \\subseteq \\mathrm{O}(2)\n$$\nFurthermore, since $\\Sigma$ is a complex manifold, it is orientable. The Levi-Civita connection preserves orientation, which restricts the holonomy group to be a subgroup of the special orthogonal group, $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_{x}(\\nabla) \\subseteq \\mathrm{SO}(2)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $(\\Sigma, g, J, \\omega)$ is a Kähler manifold. This means the metric $g$ is a Hermitian metric with respect to the complex structure $J$, and a fundamental theorem of Kähler geometry states that the Levi-Civita connection of a Kähler metric preserves the complex structure, i.e., $\\nabla J = 0$.\n\nThis condition, $\\nabla J = 0$, implies that parallel transport operators must commute with the complex structure $J$. Therefore, for any element $A \\in \\mathrm{Hol}_{x}(\\nabla)$, the relation $A J_x = J_x A$ must hold.\n\nAn alternative and more direct perspective is to view $T_x\\Sigma$ as a one-dimensional complex vector space. The metric $g$ is a Hermitian inner product on this space. The group of complex linear transformations of a one-dimensional complex vector space that preserve a Hermitian inner product is, by definition, the unitary group $\\mathrm{U}(1)$. The conditions $\\nabla g=0$ and $\\nabla J=0$ together are precisely the statement that the holonomy is contained in this group:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_{x}(\\nabla) \\subseteq \\mathrm{U}(1)\n$$\nThe group $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ is the group of complex numbers with modulus $1$, denoted $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |z| = 1 \\}$. This group is isomorphic to $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$, so the constraints are consistent. The task now is to identify which subgroup of $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ is the holonomy group.\n\nThe Ambrose-Singer theorem establishes a crucial link between curvature and holonomy. It states that the Lie algebra of the holonomy group, $\\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla)$, is generated by curvature endomorphisms $P_{\\gamma}^{-1} R_y(u,v) P_{\\gamma}$ for all points $y \\in \\Sigma$ and all vectors $u, v \\in T_y\\Sigma$, where $P_{\\gamma}$ denotes parallel transport along a path $\\gamma$ from $x$ to $y$.\n\nFor a Kähler manifold of complex dimension $1$ (a Riemann surface), the entire Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is determined by the Gaussian curvature $K$. The curvature operator $R(u,v): T_x\\Sigma \\to T_x\\Sigma$ can be expressed as $R(u,v)w = K \\omega(u,v) Jw$. The Lie algebra of $\\mathrm{U}(1)$, denoted $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$, is a one-dimensional real Lie algebra. On $\\mathbb{R}^2$, its representation $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$ is spanned by the matrix representation of $J_x$. The curvature operators $R(u,v)$ are thus elements of this Lie algebra, specifically scalar multiples of $J_x$.\n\nThe problem states that the Gaussian curvature $K$ is not identically zero on the connected manifold $\\Sigma$. This implies that there exists at least one point $y \\in \\Sigma$ where $K(y) \\neq 0$. At such a point, the curvature tensor is non-zero. By the Ambrose-Singer theorem, the holonomy Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla)$ must therefore be non-trivial (i.e., not the zero algebra $\\{0\\}$).\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla)$ is a subalgebra of the one-dimensional Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$. The only subalgebras of a one-dimensional Lie algebra are the trivial algebra $\\{0\\}$ and the algebra itself. Since we have established that $\\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla)$ is non-trivial, it must be that:\n$$\n\\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla) = \\mathfrak{u}(1)\n$$\nThe holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_x(\\nabla)$ is a Lie subgroup of $\\mathrm{U}(1)$. For a connected manifold, its identity component, the restricted holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_x^0(\\nabla)$, is a connected Lie group whose Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla)$. Since $\\mathfrak{hol}_x^0(\\nabla) = \\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla) = \\mathfrak{u}(1)$, and $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ is itself a connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$, we must conclude that the identity component of the holonomy group is the entire group $\\mathrm{U}(1)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_x^0(\\nabla) = \\mathrm{U}(1)\n$$\nThe full holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_x(\\nabla)$ contains the restricted holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_x^0(\\nabla)$. Therefore, we have the following inclusions:\n$$\n\\mathrm{U}(1) = \\mathrm{Hol}_x^0(\\nabla) \\subseteq \\mathrm{Hol}_x(\\nabla) \\subseteq \\mathrm{U}(1)\n$$\nThis sequence of inclusions forces the holonomy group to be equal to $\\mathrm{U}(1)$.\nIn summary, the holonomy group of a connected one-dimensional Kähler manifold is trivial if and only if the manifold is flat ($K \\equiv 0$). If the manifold is not flat ($K \\not\\equiv 0$), as specified in the problem, the holonomy group is the full unitary group $\\mathrm{U}(1)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mathrm{U}(1)}$$", "id": "3033725"}, {"introduction": "We now shift our focus to the closely related theory of calibrated geometry, which provides a powerful method for identifying area-minimizing submanifolds.

The definitions provided for minimal submanifolds, calibrations, and calibrated submanifolds are standard and correct.

It is a standard conceptual question in differential geometry. The solution proceeds by analyzing each option.\n\nThe core principle to be used is the theorem of Harvey and Lawson, which states that a compact, oriented, calibrated submanifold is area-minimizing in its homology class. Let $M^k$ be a compact submanifold calibrated by a $k$-form $\\varphi$. Let $N^k$ be any other compact, oriented submanifold that is homologous to $M$ (i.e., $[M] = [N]$ in homology). The proof relies on three key properties:\n1.  **Calibrated Property**: By definition, the restriction of $\\varphi$ to $M$ is its volume form $dV_M$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{Area}(M) = \\int_M dV_M = \\int_M \\varphi$.\n2.  **Closed Property**: Since $\\varphi$ is closed ($d\\varphi = 0$) and $M$ and $N$ are homologous ($N-M = \\partial C$ for some $(k+1)$-chain $C$), Stokes' theorem implies $\\int_N \\varphi - \\int_M \\varphi = \\int_{N-M} \\varphi = \\int_{\\partial C} \\varphi = \\int_C d\\varphi = 0$. Thus, $\\int_N \\varphi = \\int_M \\varphi$.\n3.  **Comass Property**: The comass of $\\varphi$ is at most $1$ ($\\|\\varphi\\|^* \\le 1$). This means that on any oriented tangent $k$-plane, the value of $\\varphi$ is less than or equal to the volume of that plane. For the submanifold $N$, this implies $\\varphi|_{T_p N} \\le dV_N$ at every point $p \\in N$. Integrating over $N$ gives $\\int_N \\varphi \\le \\int_N dV_N = \\mathrm{Area}(N)$.\n\nCombining these facts yields the conclusion: $\\mathrm{Area}(M) = \\int_M \\varphi = \\int_N \\varphi \\le \\mathrm{Area}(N)$. This shows that $M$ is an absolute area minimizer in its homology class. A minimal submanifold, in contrast, is only guaranteed to be a stationary point (a local extremum or saddle point) of the area functional.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The catenoid in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ spanning two coaxial circles is a minimal surface but not calibrated; the reason calibrations give stronger global minimization than stationarity is that a closed $k$-form $\\varphi$ of comass at most $1$ yields, for any homologous competitor $N$, the inequalities $\\int_{M}\\varphi=\\int_{N}\\varphi\\le \\mathrm{Area}(N)$ while $\\mathrm{Area}(M)=\\int_{M}\\varphi$, so $\\mathrm{Area}(M)\\le \\mathrm{Area}(N)$ for all such $N$.**\n\n-   **Example Analysis**: The catenoid is a classical example of a minimal surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, with mean curvature $H=0$. However, it is well-known that for a given boundary of two coaxial circles, if the circles are sufficiently far apart, the surface of least area spanning them is not the catenoid but rather the pair of discs enclosed by the circles. Since the catenoid is not globally area-minimizing for this boundary condition, it cannot be a calibrated submanifold. Thus, it is a correct example of a minimal submanifold that is not calibrated.\n-   **Explanation Analysis**: The explanation provided is a concise and accurate summary of the proof outlined above. It correctly combines the consequences of $\\varphi$ being closed (leading to $\\int_M \\varphi = \\int_N \\varphi$ by Stokes' theorem), the definition of a calibrated submanifold $M$ (leading to $\\mathrm{Area}(M) = \\int_M \\varphi$), and the comass condition (leading to $\\int_N \\varphi \\le \\mathrm{Area}(N)$).

The restriction of $\\varphi$ to the line segment is its own volume form. Therefore, the example is incorrect.\n-   **Explanation Analysis**: The explanation that \"calibrations only imply vanishing first variation\" is fundamentally false. The entire power of the theory of calibrations is that it provides a tool for proving *global* area minimization in a homology class, a much stronger property than mere stationarity ($H=0$).\n\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C.

The $2$-form $\\varphi = dx_1 \\wedge dx_2$ is a calibration on $\\mathbb{R}^4$ (it is closed and has comass $1$), and its restriction to the plane is exactly the volume form of the plane. Hence, the example is incorrect.\n-   **Explanation Analysis**: The explanation is incorrect on two counts. First, calibrations provide area comparisons for *homologous* competitors, not merely homotopic ones. Homology is the correct algebraic-topological framework for the argument via Stokes' theorem. Second, the comparison is global and not restricted to \"sufficiently small variations\".
