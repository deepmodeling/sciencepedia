First, we must derive the Bochner formula for a smooth function $u$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M^n, g)$. Second, we must apply this formula under specific geometric conditions to determine the supremum of the norm of the gradient of a harmonic function.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Bochner Formula**\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for $\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{g}|\\nabla u|^{2}$. We begin with the definition of the squared norm of the gradient, $|\\nabla u|^{2} = g(\\nabla u, \\nabla u)$. We use abstract index notation where repeated upper and lower indices imply summation (Einstein notation). Let $\\nabla_i$ denote the covariant derivative with respect to the $i$-th coordinate vector field, and $(\\nabla u)^i = g^{ij}\\nabla_j u$ be the components of the gradient vector field.\n\nThe squared norm is $|\\nabla u|^{2} = g_{ij}(\\nabla u)^i (\\nabla u)^j = g^{ij}(\\nabla_i u)(\\nabla_j u)$. We wish to compute the Laplacian of this scalar function, $\\Delta_g |\\nabla u|^2 = g^{kl}\\nabla_k \\nabla_l (|\\nabla u|^2)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the first covariant derivative of $|\\nabla u|^{2}$:\n$$ \\nabla_l (|\\nabla u|^2) = \\nabla_l (g^{ij}(\\nabla_i u)(\\nabla_j u)) $$\nSince the Levi-Civita connection is compatible with the metric, $\\nabla_l g^{ij} = 0$. Using the product rule for covariant differentiation:\n$$ \\nabla_l (|\\nabla u|^2) = g^{ij} [(\\nabla_l \\nabla_i u)(\\nabla_j u) + (\\nabla_i u)(\\nabla_l \\nabla_j u)] $$\nThe Hessian $\\nabla^2 u$ is a symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor, which means $\\nabla_l \\nabla_i u = \\nabla_i \\nabla_l u$. This symmetry simplifies the expression:\n$$ \\nabla_l (|\\nabla u|^2) = g^{ij} [(\\nabla_i \\nabla_l u)(\\nabla_j u) + (\\nabla_i u)(\\nabla_j \\nabla_l u)] = 2 g^{ij} (\\nabla_i \\nabla_l u)(\\nabla_j u) $$\nNow, we compute the second covariant derivative, $\\nabla_k \\nabla_l (|\\nabla u|^2)$, and contract with $g^{kl}$ to find the Laplacian.\n$$ \\nabla_k \\nabla_l (|\\nabla u|^2) = \\nabla_k [2 g^{ij} (\\nabla_i \\nabla_l u)(\\nabla_j u)] $$\nAgain using the product rule and $\\nabla_k g^{ij}=0$:\n$$ \\nabla_k \\nabla_l (|\\nabla u|^2) = 2 g^{ij} [(\\nabla_k \\nabla_i \\nabla_l u)(\\nabla_j u) + (\\nabla_i \\nabla_l u)(\\nabla_k \\nabla_j u)] $$\nThe Laplacian is obtained by contracting with $g^{kl}$:\n$$ \\Delta_g (|\\nabla u|^2) = g^{kl} \\nabla_k \\nabla_l (|\\nabla u|^2) = 2 g^{kl} g^{ij} [(\\nabla_k \\nabla_i \\nabla_l u)(\\nabla_j u) + (\\nabla_i \\nabla_l u)(\\nabla_k \\nabla_j u)] $$\nLet's analyze the two terms in the brackets separately.\n\nThe second term is:\n$$ 2 g^{kl} g^{ij} (\\nabla_i \\nabla_l u)(\\nabla_k \\nabla_j u) = 2 (g^{ki}\\nabla_i \\nabla_l u)(g^{lj}\\nabla_k \\nabla_j u) = 2 (\\nabla^k \\nabla_l u)(\\nabla^l \\nabla_k u) $$\nThis is twice the squared norm of the Hessian tensor, $2|\\nabla^2 u|^2$. The squared norm of the Hessian is $|\\nabla^2 u|^2 = g^{ik}g^{jl}(\\nabla_i \\nabla_j u)(\\nabla_k \\nabla_l u)$. The expression matches by relabeling indices.\n\nThe first term is:\n$$ 2 g^{kl} g^{ij} (\\nabla_k \\nabla_i \\nabla_l u)(\\nabla_j u) $$\nTo evaluate this, we use the Ricci identity for commuting covariant derivatives. For a $(0,2)$-tensor like $\\nabla^2 u$, the identity is $\\nabla_k \\nabla_i T_{lj} - \\nabla_i \\nabla_k T_{lj} = -R_{kil}{}^p T_{pj} - R_{kij}{}^p T_{lp}$. This is too complex. It is simpler to commute derivatives acting on the 1-form $du$ (with components $\\nabla_j u$). The Ricci identity is $\\nabla_k \\nabla_i (\\nabla_l u) - \\nabla_i \\nabla_k (\\nabla_l u) = -R_{kil}{}^p \\nabla_p u$.\nUsing symmetry of the Hessian, we have $\\nabla_i\\nabla_l u = \\nabla_l\\nabla_i u$. So we have $\\nabla_k (\\nabla_i \\nabla_l u)$. We want to reorder the derivatives to isolate the Laplacian.\n$$ \\nabla_k \\nabla_i \\nabla_l u = \\nabla_l \\nabla_k \\nabla_i u + R_{kli}{}^p \\nabla_p u $$\nSubstituting this into the first term:\n$$ 2 g^{ij}g^{kl}(\\nabla_l \\nabla_k \\nabla_i u + R_{kli}{}^p \\nabla_p u)(\\nabla_j u) = 2 g^{ij}g^{kl}(\\nabla_l \\nabla_k \\nabla_i u)(\\nabla_j u) + 2 g^{ij}g^{kl}(R_{kli}{}^p \\nabla_p u)(\\nabla_j u) $$\nLet's analyze these two new expressions.\nThe first part is:\n$$ 2 g^{ij}g^{kl}(\\nabla_l \\nabla_k \\nabla_i u)(\\nabla_j u) = 2 g^{kl} (\\nabla_l \\nabla_k (g^{ij}\\nabla_i u)) (\\nabla_j u) $$\nThe order of covariant derivatives and contractions can be interchanged. This term is not what we want.\n\nLet's retry the commutation.\n$$ \\nabla_k\n\\nabla_i \\nabla_l u = \\nabla_i \\nabla_k \\nabla_l u - R_{kil}{}^p\\nabla_p u $$\nThe term becomes $2 g^{kl}g^{ij}(\\nabla_i \\nabla_k \\nabla_l u)(\\nabla_j u) - 2 g^{kl}g^{ij}(R_{kil}{}^p\\nabla_p u)(\\nabla_j u)$.\nThe first part is $2 g^{ij} \\nabla_i (g^{kl} \\nabla_k \\nabla_l u) \\nabla_j u = 2 g^{ij} (\\nabla_i \\Delta_g u) (\\nabla_j u) = 2 \\langle \\nabla (\\Delta_g u), \\nabla u \\rangle$.\nThe second part is $-2 (g^{ij}R_{kil}{}^p) (g^{kl} \\nabla_p u \\nabla_j u)$. The Ricci tensor is defined as $R_{lp} = g^{ik}R_{ilpk}$. The term in parentheses is $g^{ij}R_{kil}{}^p = g^{ij}g^{pq}R_{kilq}$. Using symmetries of the Riemann tensor, $g^{ij}R_{kilq} = g^{ij}R_{lqki} = R_{lq}{}^{q}{}_{k}$. No, this is incorrect. The contraction $g^{ik}R_{iklp}$ gives the Ricci tensor $R_{lp}$.\nLet's contract $g^{ij}R_{kilp}$. This is $-g^{ij}R_{iklp} = -R_{klp}{}^i$. This is not Ricci.\nCorrect contraction for Ricci is $R_{lp} = g^{ik}R_{ilpk}$. Let's use index $j$ for the second slot: $R_{jp} = g^{ik}R_{ijkp}$.\nOur term is $g^{ij}g^{kl}R_{kilp}\\nabla^p u \\nabla_j u = g^{ij}R_{i}{}^{l}{}_{lp} \\nabla^p u \\nabla_j u$. $R_{i}{}^{l}{}_{lp}=R_{ip}$, which is the Ricci tensor.\nSo the term is $2(R_{ip}\\nabla^p u g^{ij}\\nabla_j u)=2 R_{ip}\\nabla^p u \\nabla^i u = 2 \\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla u, \\nabla u)$.\n\nPutting all pieces together:\n$$ \\Delta_g (|\\nabla u|^2) = 2 \\langle \\nabla(\\Delta_g u), \\nabla u \\rangle + 2 \\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla u, \\nabla u) + 2 |\\nabla^2 u|^2 $$\nDividing by $2$ gives the Bochner formula for functions:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{g}|\\nabla u|^{2} = |\\nabla^{2}u|^{2} + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla u, \\nabla u) + \\langle \\nabla(\\Delta_{g}u), \\nabla u \\rangle $$\n\n**Part 2: Application to a Harmonic Function on a Closed Manifold**\n\nWe are given that $(M^n, g)$ is a closed manifold (compact and without boundary) with non-negative Ricci curvature, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$. The function $u$ is harmonic, meaning $\\Delta_g u = 0$ on $M$. We are asked to find $\\sup_{x \\in M} |\\nabla u(x)|$ using the derived formula.\n\nLet's apply the given conditions to the Bochner formula:\n1.  Since $u$ is harmonic, $\\Delta_g u = 0$ everywhere on $M$. Consequently, the gradient of the constant function $0$ is the zero vector field, so $\\nabla(\\Delta_g u) = 0$. The third term in the formula vanishes: $\\langle \\nabla(\\Delta_g u), \\nabla u \\rangle = \\langle 0, \\nabla u \\rangle = 0$.\n2.  The Ricci curvature is non-negative, meaning $\\operatorname{Ric}(X,X) \\ge 0$ for any tangent vector $X$. In particular, for $X = \\nabla u(x)$, we have $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla u(x), \\nabla u(x)) \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in M$.\n3.  The term $|\\nabla^2 u|^2$ is the squared norm of the Hessian tensor, so it is non-negative, $|\\nabla^2 u|^2 \\ge 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the Bochner formula, we get a simplified inequality:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{g}|\\nabla u|^{2} = |\\nabla^{2}u|^{2} + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla u, \\nabla u) \\ge 0 + 0 = 0 $$\nLet $f(x) = |\\nabla u(x)|^2$. The inequality is $\\Delta_g f \\ge 0$. A function whose Laplacian is non-negative is called a subharmonic function.\n\nThe manifold $M$ is closed, which means it is compact and has no boundary. By the weak maximum principle for elliptic operators, a subharmonic function on a compact manifold must attain its maximum on the boundary. Since $M$ has no boundary, we invoke the strong maximum principle. It states that any non-constant subharmonic function on a connected open manifold cannot attain a local maximum. As $M$ is a manifold without boundary, every point is an interior point. If we assume $M$ is connected (which is standard for such problems), the function $f = |\\nabla u|^2$ must be constant on $M$. If $f$ were not constant, it would have to attain a maximum at some point $p \\in M$, which would contradict the strong maximum principle.\n\nTherefore, $|\\nabla u|^2$ is a constant function on $M$. Let $|\\nabla u|^2 = C$ for some constant $C \\ge 0$.\nSince $|\\nabla u|^2$ is constant, its Laplacian is zero: $\\Delta_g(|\\nabla u|^2) = \\Delta_g(C) = 0$.\nPlugging this back into our simplified Bochner formula:\n$$ 0 = |\\nabla^{2}u|^{2} + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla u, \\nabla u) $$\nThis is an equation where a sum of two non-negative terms equals zero. This is only possible if both terms are identically zero everywhere on $M$:\n1.  $|\\nabla^2 u(x)|^2 = 0$ for all $x \\in M$, which implies $\\nabla^2 u \\equiv 0$.\n2.  $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla u(x), \\nabla u(x)) = 0$ for all $x \\in M$.\n\nThe condition $\\nabla^2 u = 0$ means that the $1$-form $du$ is parallel, $\\nabla(du) = 0$. A parallel form on a Riemannian manifold is always harmonic with respect to the Hodge Laplacian.\nIndependently, the definition of the gradient implies that the $1$-form $du$ is exact, as it is the exterior derivative of the $0$-form (function) $u$.\n\nSo, the $1$-form $du$ is both harmonic and exact on the closed manifold $M$. By a fundamental result of Hodge theory, any form that is both harmonic and exact on a closed manifold must be the zero form. We can show this using the $L^2$ inner product on forms. Let $\\omega = du$. Since $\\omega$ is harmonic, its Hodge Laplacian is zero, $\\Delta_H \\omega = (d\\delta + \\delta d)\\omega = 0$. This implies $d\\omega = 0$ and $\\delta\\omega = 0$.\nThe squared $L^2$-norm of $\\omega$ is:\n$$ \\|\\omega\\|^2_{L^2} = \\int_M \\langle \\omega, \\omega \\rangle \\, dV_g = \\int_M \\langle du, \\omega \\rangle \\, dV_g $$\nUsing the property that the exterior derivative $d$ and the codifferential $\\delta$ are formal adjoints with respect to this inner product on a closed manifold, we have $\\langle d\\alpha, \\beta \\rangle_{L^2} = \\langle \\alpha, \\delta\\beta \\rangle_{L^2}$. Applying this:\n$$ \\|\\omega\\|^2_{L^2} = \\langle du, \\omega \\rangle_{L^2} = \\langle u, \\delta\\omega \\rangle_{L^2} $$\nSince $\\omega=du$ is harmonic, we have $\\delta \\omega = 0$. Thus:\n$$ \\|\\omega\\|^2_{L^2} = \\langle u, 0 \\rangle_{L^2} = 0 $$\nThe norm of $\\omega = du$ is zero, which implies that the form itself must be identically zero, $du=0$.\n\nIf the differential $du$ is the zero $1$-form, then its corresponding vector field, the gradient $\\nabla u$, must be the zero vector field.\n$$ \\nabla u(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in M $$\nConsequently, the norm of the gradient is zero everywhere:\n$$ |\\nabla u(x)| = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in M $$\nThe supremum of a function that is identically zero is zero.\n$$ \\sup_{x \\in M} |\\nabla u(x)| = 0 $$\nThis result is a specific case of the Bochner vanishing theorem. It implies that any harmonic function on a closed manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature must be constant.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3029659"}, {"introduction": "After mastering the scalar case, we extend the Bochner technique to analyze maps between manifolds, a subject central to geometric analysis.

The Riemann curvature tensor $R^N$ of such a space is given by the formula:\n$$\nR^{N}(U,V)W = K \\left( \\langle V, W \\rangle_{h} U - \\langle U, W \\rangle_{h} V \\right)\n$$\nFor any vectors $U,V,W \\in T_{u(p)}S^m$. Since $K=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nR^{N}(U,V)W = \\langle V, W \\rangle_{h} U - \\langle U, W \\rangle_{h} V\n$$\nWe substitute this into the definition of $\\mathcal{C}(p)$, setting $U=X_a$, $V=X_b$, and we need to compute the inner product of $R^N(X_a, X_b)X_a$ with $X_b$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}(p) = \\sum_{a,b=1}^{n} \\left\\langle R^{N}(X_{a},X_{b})X_{a}, X_{b} \\right\\rangle_{h}\n$$\nLet's first compute the term inside the summation:\n$$\nR^{N}(X_{a},X_{b})X_{a} = \\langle X_{b}, X_{a} \\rangle_{h} X_{a} - \\langle X_{a}, X_{a} \\rangle_{h} X_{b}\n$$\nNow, we take the inner product with $X_{b}$:\n$$\n\\left\\langle R^{N}(X_{a},X_{b})X_{a}, X_{b} \\right\\rangle_{h} = \\left\\langle \\langle X_{b}, X_{a} \\rangle_{h} X_{a} - \\langle X_{a}, X_{a} \\rangle_{h} X_{b}, X_{b} \\right\\rangle_{h}\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_{h}$:\n$$\n= \\langle X_{b}, X_{a} \\rangle_{h} \\langle X_{a}, X_{b} \\rangle_{h} - \\langle X_{a}, X_{a} \\rangle_{h} \\langle X_{b}, X_{b} \\rangle_{h}\n$$\n$$\n= \\langle X_{a}, X_{b} \\rangle_{h}^{2} - |X_{a}|_{h}^{2} |X_{b}|_{h}^{2}\n$$\nNow, we sum over all $a, b$ from $1$ to $n$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}(p) = \\sum_{a,b=1}^{n} \\left( \\langle X_{a}, X_{b} \\rangle_{h}^{2} - |X_{a}|_{h}^{2} |X_{b}|_{h}^{2} \\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Expression in terms of Singular Values**\n\nThe quantity $\\mathcal{C}(p)$ is a scalar invariant, meaning its value does not depend on the choice of the $g$-orthonormal basis $\\{e_a\\}$ for $T_pM$. We can exploit this by choosing a basis adapted to the linear map $du_p$.\nBy the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) theorem, there exists a $g$-orthonormal basis $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ of $T_pM$ and an $h$-orthonormal set of vectors $\\{v_i\\}_{i=1}^r$ in $T_{u(p)}S^m$ such that:\n$$\ndu_p(e_i) = \\sigma_i v_i \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, \\dots, r\n$$\n$$\ndu_p(e_i) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i = r+1, \\dots, n\n$$\nwhere $\\{\\sigma_i\\}_{i=1}^r$ are the positive singular values of $du_p$, and $r = \\operatorname{rank}(du_p)$. We can extend this by setting $\\sigma_i = 0$ for $i > r$.\n\nLet us use this basis, relabeling $e_i$ as $e_a$. Then $X_a = du_p(e_a)$.\nThe inner product of two such vectors is:\n$$\n\\langle X_{a}, X_{b} \\rangle_{h} = \\langle \\sigma_{a} v_{a}, \\sigma_{b} v_{b} \\rangle_{h} = \\sigma_{a} \\sigma_{b} \\langle v_{a}, v_{b} \\rangle_{h}\n$$\nSince $\\{v_i\\}$ is an orthonormal set, $\\langle v_a, v_b \\rangle_h = \\delta_{ab}$ (the Kronecker delta). Thus:\n$$\n\\langle X_{a}, X_{b} \\rangle_{h} = \\sigma_{a} \\sigma_{b} \\delta_{ab}\n$$\nThis holds for all $a, b \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ because if $a > r$ or $b > r$, then $\\sigma_a=0$ or $\\sigma_b=0$.\nThe squared norm of $X_a$ is:\n$$\n|X_a|_h^2 = \\langle X_a, X_a \\rangle_h = \\sigma_a^2\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\mathcal{C}(p)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}(p) = \\sum_{a,b=1}^{n} \\left( (\\sigma_{a} \\sigma_{b} \\delta_{ab})^{2} - (\\sigma_{a}^{2})(\\sigma_{b}^{2}) \\right)\n$$\nThe first term simplifies due to the Kronecker delta: $\\delta_{ab}^2 = \\delta_{ab}$, and the sum over $b$ collapses.\n$$\n\\sum_{a,b=1}^{n} \\sigma_{a}^{2} \\sigma_{b}^{2} \\delta_{ab} = \\sum_{a=1}^{n} \\sigma_{a}^{2} \\sigma_{a}^{2} = \\sum_{a=1}^{n} \\sigma_{a}^{4}\n$$\nThe second term is a product of two independent sums:\n$$\n\\sum_{a,b=1}^{n} \\sigma_{a}^{2} \\sigma_{b}^{2} = \\left( \\sum_{a=1}^{n} \\sigma_{a}^{2} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{b=1}^{n} \\sigma_{b}^{2} \\right) = \\left( \\sum_{a=1}^{n} \\sigma_{a}^{2} \\right)^{2}\n$$\nCombining the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}(p) = \\sum_{a=1}^{n} \\sigma_{a}^{4} - \\left( \\sum_{a=1}^{n} \\sigma_{a}^{2} \\right)^{2}\n$$\nSince $\\sigma_i = 0$ for $i > r$, we can write this sum up to $r$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}(p) = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\sigma_{i}^{4} - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\sigma_{i}^{2} \\right)^{2}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Sign of $\\mathcal{C}(p)$ and Equality Case**\n\nThe problem asks to explain the sign of $\\mathcal{C}(p)$. Note that the curvature term defined in the problem is related to the sectional curvature of the target manifold. For any two vectors $U, V$, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states $\\langle U, V \\rangle^2 \\le |U|^2 |V|^2$. In our earlier expression, $\\mathcal{C}(p) = \\sum_{a,b=1}^{n} \\left( \\langle X_a, X_b \\rangle_h^2 - |X_a|_h^2 |X_b|_h^2 \\right)$, each term in the sum is non-positive. Therefore, $\\mathcal{C}(p) \\le 0$.\n\nWe can see this more explicitly from the expression in terms of singular values. Let $y_i = \\sigma_i^2$ for $i=1, \\dots, r$.

All terms used, such as Kähler manifold, Chern connection, Chern curvature, symmetric powers of vector bundles, and the Bochner identity, are standard concepts in this field. The assumptions, including the compactness of the manifold and the positivity of a certain curvature operator, are typical for proving vanishing theorems of the Kodaira-Nakano type. The problem is self-contained, logically consistent, and well-posed, asking for a specific calculation and a subsequent theoretical explanation. It is a standard, non-trivial problem in geometric analysis. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Solution\n\nLet $(M^n, g)$ be a compact Kähler manifold with Kähler form $\\omega$. Let $E = T^{1,0}M$ be the holomorphic tangent bundle, equipped with its Chern connection $\\nabla$ and curvature two-form $\\Theta_E$. The curvature is an $\\operatorname{End}(E)$-valued $(1,1)$-form. The problem considers the operator $\\mathcal{R}_E = \\sqrt{-1}\\,\\Lambda\\,\\Theta_E$, where $\\Lambda$ is the contraction operator with $\\omega$. This operator $\\mathcal{R}_E$ is a Hermitian endomorphism of the bundle $E$.\n\nWe are given a holomorphic section $s$ of the bundle of symmetric $m$-tensors, $V = S^m E$. At a point $p \\in M$, we are given a local unitary frame $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ for $E_p$ that diagonalizes $\\mathcal{R}_E$. Specifically, $\\mathcal{R}_E(e_k) = \\rho_k e_k$ for $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, with eigenvalues $\\rho_k > 0$.\n\nThe section $s$ at $p$ is written as $s=\\sum_{i_{1},\\dots,i_{m}=1}^{n} s^{i_{1}\\cdots i_{m}}\\,e_{i_{1}}\\odot\\cdots\\odot e_{i_{m}}$. The coefficients $s^{i_1 \\cdots i_m}$ are complex numbers, symmetric in their indices. The notation requires careful interpretation. We identify the space of symmetric tensors $S^m E$ as a subspace of the $m$-fold tensor product $E^{\\otimes m}$. An element $s \\in S^m E_p$ is represented by a tensor in $E_p^{\\otimes m}$ which is invariant under the action of the symmetric group. In the given local frame $\\{e_k\\}$, such a tensor $s$ can be written as:\n$$\ns = \\sum_{i_1, \\dots, i_m=1}^n s^{i_1 \\dots i_m} e_{i_1} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes e_{i_m}\n$$\nwhere the components $s^{i_1 \\dots i_m}$ satisfy $s^{i_{\\sigma(1)} \\dots i_{\\sigma(m)}} = s^{i_1 \\dots i_m}$ for any permutation $\\sigma$. The frame $\\{e_{i_1} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes e_{i_m}\\}_{1 \\le i_k \\le n}$ is an orthonormal basis for $E_p^{\\otimes m}$. The inner product on $S^m E_p$ is inherited from $E_p^{\\otimes m}$. For two sections $s, t \\in S^m E_p$ with components $s^I$ and $t^I$ (where $I = (i_1, \\dots, i_m)$), their inner product is:\n$$\n\\langle s, t \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_I s^I e_{i_1} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes e_{i_m}, \\sum_J t^J e_{j_1} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes e_{j_m} \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{I,J} s^I \\overline{t^J} \\delta_{I,J} = \\sum_{i_1, \\dots, i_m=1}^n s^{i_1 \\dots i_m} \\overline{t^{i_1 \\dots i_m}}\n$$\nThe problem's notation involving $\\odot$ and \"orthonormal symmetric basis\" is understood as a reference to this standard framework.\n\nThe Chern curvature of the symmetric power bundle $S^m E$ is induced from the curvature of $E$. The functoriality of the connection implies that the curvature operator $\\mathcal{R}_{S^m E} = \\sqrt{-1}\\,\\Lambda\\,\\Theta_{S^m E}$ acts on a simple symmetric tensor $v_1 \\odot \\dots \\odot v_m$ according to the Leibniz rule:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{S^m E} (v_1 \\odot \\dots \\odot v_m) = \\sum_{j=1}^m v_1 \\odot \\dots \\odot \\mathcal{R}_E(v_j) \\odot \\dots \\odot v_m\n$$\nApplying this to our representation of $s$ in $E^{\\otimes m}$, the operator $\\mathcal{R}_{S^m E}$ is the restriction of the operator on $E^{\\otimes m}$ given by $\\mathcal{R}_{E^{\\otimes m}} = \\sum_{j=1}^m \\operatorname{Id} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes \\mathcal{R}_E \\otimes \\dots \\otimes \\operatorname{Id}$ (where $\\mathcal{R}_E$ is in the $j$-th slot). Applying this to $s$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{S^m E}(s) = \\sum_{i_1, \\dots, i_m=1}^n s^{i_1 \\dots i_m} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^m e_{i_1} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes \\mathcal{R}_E(e_{i_j}) \\otimes \\dots \\otimes e_{i_m} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the fact that $\\{e_k\\}$ is an eigenbasis for $\\mathcal{R}_E$ with $\\mathcal{R}_E(e_k) = \\rho_k e_k$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{S^m E}(s) = \\sum_{i_1, \\dots, i_m=1}^n s^{i_1 \\dots i_m} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^m \\rho_{i_j} \\right) (e_{i_1} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes e_{i_m})\n$$\nThe resulting tensor has components $s^{i_1 \\dots i_m} (\\rho_{i_1} + \\dots + \\rho_{i_m})$, which remain symmetric because the sum of eigenvalues is symmetric under permutation of indices.\n\nWe can now compute the desired curvature term $\\langle \\mathcal{R}_{S^m E}\\,s,\\,s\\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathcal{R}_{S^m E}\\,s,\\,s\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_I s^I \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^m \\rho_{i_j}\\right) e_{i_1}\\otimes \\dots \\otimes e_{i_m}, \\sum_K s^K e_{k_1}\\otimes \\dots \\otimes e_{k_m} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis $\\{e_{i_1} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes e_{i_m}\\}$:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathcal{R}_{S^m E}\\,s,\\,s\\rangle = \\sum_{I,K} s^I \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^m \\rho_{i_j}\\right) \\overline{s^K} \\delta_{IK} = \\sum_I \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^m \\rho_{i_j}\\right) s^I \\overline{s^I}\n$$\nThis gives the final expression for the curvature term at point $p$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sqrt{-1}\\,\\Lambda\\,\\Theta_{S^{m}T^{1,0}M}\\,s,\\,s\\rangle = \\sum_{i_1,\\dots,i_m=1}^{n} (\\rho_{i_1}+\\cdots+\\rho_{i_m}) |s^{i_1\\cdots i_m}|^2\n$$\n\nTo explain the vanishing of holomorphic sections, we use the integrated Bochner-Weitzenböck formula for a holomorphic section $s \\in \\Gamma(S^m T^{1,0}M)$. For any such section, $\\bar{\\partial}s=0$. The identity, integrated over the compact manifold $M$, is:\n$$\n\\int_M |\\nabla s|^2 \\,dV + \\int_M \\langle \\sqrt{-1}\\,\\Lambda\\,\\Theta_{S^{m}T^{1,0}M}\\,s,\\,s\\rangle \\,dV = 0\n$$\nwhere $dV$ is the volume form of the Kähler metric. The term $|\\nabla s|^2 = \\langle \\nabla s, \\nabla s \\rangle$ is the squared norm of the covariant derivative of $s$, which is non-negative. Thus, its integral is non-negative: $\\int_M |\\nabla s|^2 \\,dV \\ge 0$.\n\nThe second term is the integral of the curvature expression we just computed. By assumption, all eigenvalues $\\rho_k$ are strictly positive, $\\rho_k > 0$. Therefore, for any multi-index $(i_1, \\dots, i_m)$, the sum $\\rho_{i_1}+\\cdots+\\rho_{i_m}$ is strictly positive. The term $|s^{i_1\\cdots i_m}|^2$ is non-negative. The entire sum $\\sum_{i_1,\\dots,i_m=1}^{n} (\\rho_{i_1}+\\cdots+\\rho_{i_m}) |s^{i_1\\cdots i_m}|^2$ is a sum of non-negative numbers, so it is non-negative. This holds at every point on $M$. The integral of this non-negative function is therefore also non-negative:\n$$\n\\int_M \\langle \\sqrt{-1}\\,\\Lambda\\,\\Theta_{S^{m}T^{1,0}M}\\,s,\\,s\\rangle \\,dV \\ge 0\n$$\nThe Bochner identity states that the sum of these two non-negative terms is zero. This is possible only if both terms are individually zero.\n$$\n\\int_M |\\nabla s|^2 \\,dV = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\int_M \\langle \\sqrt{-1}\\,\\Lambda\\,\\Theta_{S^{m}T^{1,0}M}\\,s,\\,s\\rangle \\,dV = 0\n$$\nSince the integrands are non-negative and continuous, they must be identically zero everywhere on $M$. From the second equation, we have:\n$$\n\\langle \\sqrt{-1}\\,\\Lambda\\,\\Theta_{S^{m}T^{1,0}M}\\,s,\\,s\\rangle = \\sum_{i_1,\\dots,i_m=1}^{n} (\\rho_{i_1}+\\cdots+\\rho_{i_m}) |s^{i_1\\cdots i_m}|^2 = 0\n$$\nat every point. Since $\\rho_{i_1}+\\cdots+\\rho_{i_m} > 0$, this equality can only hold if $|s^{i_1\\cdots i_m}|^2 = 0$ for all multi-indices $(i_1, \\dots, i_m)$. This implies $s^{i_1\\cdots i_m} = 0$ for all indices, which means the section $s$ is identically zero everywhere on $M$.\n\nTherefore, any holomorphic section of $S^m T^{1,0}M$ must be the zero section, i.e., $H^0(M, S^m T^{1,0}M) = \\{0\\}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sum_{i_{1},\\dots,i_{m}=1}^{n} (\\rho_{i_{1}}+\\cdots+\\rho_{i_{m}}) |s^{i_{1}\\cdots i_{m}}|^{2}}$$", "id": "3026001"}]}
