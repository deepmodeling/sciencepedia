We shall address these two parts in sequence, adhering strictly to the definitions specified.\n\nThe integral current $T$ is defined as $T = \\llbracket B_{r}(0) \\cap P, \\tau, Q \\rrbracket$. Here, the underlying rectifiable set is $M = B_{r}(0) \\cap P$, where $P$ is an $m$-dimensional linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ and $B_{r}(0)$ is the open ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin. Since $P$ is a linear subspace, the intersection $M$ is an $m$-dimensional open disk of radius $r$ lying within $P$. The orientation is determined by the unit simple $m$-vector $\\tau$ associated with $P$, and the multiplicity is a constant integer function $\\theta(x) = Q$ for all $x \\in M$. For the purpose of integration, we will consider the closure of this set, which does not change the value of the integral. The support of $T$, denoted $\\mathrm{spt}(T)$, is the closure of $M$, i.e., the closed $m$-disk $\\overline{B_r(0) \\cap P}$.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the Mass $\\mathbf{M}(T)$**\n\nWe are instructed to use the area formula for an integer rectifiable current $T = \\llbracket M, \\vec{\\xi}, \\theta \\rrbracket$, which states that its mass $\\mathbf{M}(T)$ is given by the integral of its multiplicity function over the rectifiable set with respect to the $m$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\\mathcal{H}^m$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}(T) = \\int_{M} \\theta(x) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^m(x)\n$$\nIn our case, the set is $M = B_{r}(0) \\cap P$ and the multiplicity function is the constant $\\theta(x) = Q$ for $x \\in M$.\nSubstituting these into the area formula, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}(T) = \\int_{B_{r}(0) \\cap P} Q \\, d\\mathcal{H}^m(x)\n$$\nSince $Q$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}(T) = Q \\int_{B_{r}(0) \\cap P} d\\mathcal{H}^m(x)\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{B_{r}(0) \\cap P} d\\mathcal{H}^m(x)$ is simply the $m$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the set $B_{r}(0) \\cap P$. This set is an $m$-dimensional ball of radius $r$. The $m$-dimensional measure of an $m$-ball of radius $r$ is given by $\\omega_{m} r^m$, where $\\omega_{m}$ is the measure of the unit $m$-ball.\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^m(B_{r}(0) \\cap P) = \\omega_{m} r^m\n$$\nThe mass of the current $T$ is thus:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}(T) = Q \\omega_{m} r^m\n$$\nThe problem provides the constant $\\omega_{m} = \\frac{\\pi^{m/2}}{\\Gamma\\!\\left(\\frac{m}{2}+1\\right)}$. Substituting this expression, we obtain the final formula for the mass:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}(T) = Q \\frac{\\pi^{m/2}}{\\Gamma\\!\\left(\\frac{m}{2}+1\\right)} r^m\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Verification of Area-Minimization**\n\nTo verify that $T$ is area-minimizing among all integral $m$-currents $S$ with $\\partial S = \\partial T$, we will employ the calibration method. A calibration for $T$ is a closed differential $m$-form $\\phi$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ (i.e., $d\\phi = 0$) with comass at most one everywhere (i.e., $\\|\\phi(x)\\|^* \\le 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$), such that it orients the tangent planes of $T$ maximally. Specifically, for $T = \\llbracket M, \\tau, Q \\rrbracket$, the orienting $m$-vector field is $\\vec{T}(x) = Q \\tau(x)$. The calibration condition is $\\langle \\vec{T}(x), \\phi(x) \\rangle = Q$ for $\\mathcal{H}^m$-almost every $x \\in M$. This is equivalent to $\\langle \\tau(x), \\phi(x) \\rangle = 1$, since $\\tau$ is a unit $m$-vector field.\n\nLet's construct such a form $\\phi$. We can choose an orthonormal coordinate system $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_{m+n}\\}$ for $\\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ such that the subspace $P$ is spanned by the first $m$ basis vectors $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_m\\}$. In these coordinates, $P = \\{ (x_1, \\dots, x_m, 0, \\dots, 0) \\}$. The orientation of $P$ can be taken as the simple $m$-vector $\\tau = e_1 \\wedge e_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_m$. This orientation is constant over $P$.\n\nConsider the constant differential $m$-form $\\phi$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ given by:\n$$\n\\phi = dx_1 \\wedge dx_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx_m\n$$\nWe must verify that $\\phi$ satisfies the three properties of a calibration for $T$.\n\n_1. $\\phi$ is closed ($d\\phi = 0$):_\nThe exterior derivative of $\\phi$ is $d\\phi = d(dx_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx_m)$. Since the coordinate functions $x_i$ have continuous second partial derivatives (all zero), we have $d(dx_i) = 0$. By the product rule for exterior derivatives, $d\\phi=0$.\n\n_2. $\\phi$ has comass at most $1$ ($\\|\\phi\\|^* \\le 1$):_\nThe comass of an $m$-form at a point $x$ is defined as $\\|\\phi(x)\\|^* = \\sup \\{ \\langle \\xi, \\phi(x) \\rangle \\mid \\xi \\text{ is a unit simple } m\\text{-vector at } x \\}$. For our constant form $\\phi$, the value $\\phi(x)$ is the same tensor at every point. The value of $\\langle \\xi, \\phi \\rangle$ is the determinant of the matrix whose columns are the coordinate representations of the vectors spanning $\\xi$ with respect to the basis $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_m\\}$. This is geometrically interpreted as the signed $m$-volume of the projection of the parallelepiped defined by $\\xi$'s spanning vectors onto the subspace $P$. The volume of a projection is always less than or equal to the original volume. Since $\\xi$ is a unit $m$-vector, it is spanned by an orthonormal set of vectors, defining a parallelepiped of volume $1$. Thus, $|\\langle \\xi, \\phi \\rangle| \\le 1$ for any unit simple $m$-vector $\\xi$. The maximum value of $1$ is achieved when $\\xi$ is the orienting vector $\\tau = e_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_m$ itself. Therefore, $\\|\\phi\\|^* = 1$.\n\n_3. $\\phi$ calibrates $T$ ($T(\\phi) = \\mathbf{M}(T)$):_\nThe action of $T$ on $\\phi$ is given by\n$$\nT(\\phi) = \\int_{M} Q \\langle \\tau, \\phi(x) \\rangle \\, d\\mathcal{H}^m(x)\n$$\nFor any $x \\in M \\subset P$, the orienting $m$-vector is $\\tau = e_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_m$. We evaluate the pairing:\n$$\n\\langle \\tau, \\phi(x) \\rangle = \\phi(\\tau) = (dx_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx_m)(e_1, \\dots, e_m) = \\det(\\delta_{ij}) = 1\n$$\nThis holds for all $x \\in M$. Substituting this into the integral for $T(\\phi)$:\n$$\nT(\\phi) = \\int_{M} Q \\cdot 1 \\, d\\mathcal{H}^m(x) = Q \\int_{M} d\\mathcal{H}^m(x) = Q \\mathcal{H}^m(M) = Q \\omega_m r^m\n$$\nThis is precisely the mass $\\mathbf{M}(T)$ we computed in the first part. So, $T(\\phi)=\\mathbf{M}(T)$.\n\nNow, we use the calibration $\\phi$ to prove area-minimization. Let $S$ be any other integral $m$-current in $\\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ such that $\\partial S = \\partial T$. The difference $S-T$ is an integral $m$-current with no boundary, i.e., $\\partial(S-T) = \\partial S - \\partial T = 0$. Thus, $S-T$ is an integral $m$-cycle. Since $\\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ is contractible, its integer-coefficient homology groups are trivial for dimensions greater than $0$. In particular, $H_m(\\mathbb{R}^{m+n}, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This implies that any $m$-cycle is an $m$-boundary. Therefore, there exists an integral $(m+1)$-current $R$ such that $S-T = \\partial R$.\n\nBy Stokes' theorem for currents, for any closed form $\\omega$ (i.e., $d\\omega = 0$), we have $(\\partial R)(\\omega) = R(d\\omega)$. Applying this to our cycle $S-T$ and the closed calibration form $\\phi$:\n$$\n(S-T)(\\phi) = (\\partial R)(\\phi) = R(d\\phi) = R(0) = 0\n$$\nThis implies $S(\\phi) = T(\\phi)$.\n\nFrom the definition of the mass of a current, we have $\\mathbf{M}(S) = \\sup \\{ S(\\omega) \\mid \\|\\omega\\|^* \\le 1 \\}$. Since our calibration $\\phi$ has comass $\\|\\phi\\|^*=1$, it is a valid test form in the supremum. Therefore,\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}(S) \\ge S(\\phi)\n$$\nCombining our findings, we have the chain of relations:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}(S) \\ge S(\\phi) = T(\\phi) = \\mathbf{M}(T)\n$$\nThis inequality, $\\mathbf{M}(S) \\ge \\mathbf{M}(T)$, holds for any integral current $S$ with the same boundary as $T$. This concludes the verification that $T$ is area-minimizing.\n\nThe problem requires a single analytic expression as the final answer.

This is precisely an $m$-dimensional ball of radius $r$ lying within the subspace $P$.\n\nThe $m$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\\mathcal{H}^{m}$ when restricted to an $m$-dimensional affine subspace (such as $P$ translated by $-x$) coincides with the $m$-dimensional Lebesgue measure on that subspace. Therefore, the $\\mathcal{H}^{m}$-measure of this $m$-dimensional ball is its $m$-dimensional volume.\n\nThe volume of an $m$-dimensional ball of radius $r$ is, by definition of $\\omega_m$, given by $\\omega_{m} r^{m}$.

We are guided to use the coarea formula. Let $f: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be the radial function $f(x) \\coloneqq |x|$.

For the cone $C$, the approximate tangent plane $T_{x}C$ at any point $x \\in C \\setminus \\{0\\}$ contains the radial vector $\\frac{x}{|x|}$. The gradient of $f(x)=|x|$ is $\\nabla f(x) = \\frac{x}{|x|}$.

Since $b$ is a nonzero vector, $|b| \\neq 0$, and for $r \\in (0,1)$, $H_u(r) \\neq 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the Dirichlet energy $D_{u}(r) = \\int_{B_{r}} |\\nabla u|^{2} \\, dx$.\nThe gradient of $u(x_1, x_2) = b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2$ is $\\nabla u = (b_1, b_2) = b$.\nThe squared magnitude of the gradient is $|\\nabla u|^{2} = |b|^{2}$, which is a constant.\nThe Dirichlet energy is the integral of this constant over the disk $B_r$:\n$$D_{u}(r) = \\int_{B_{r}} |b|^{2} \\, dx = |b|^{2} \\cdot \\text{Area}(B_{r}) = |b|^{2} (\\pi r^{2})$$\n\nFinally, we compute Almgren's frequency function $N_{u}(r)$:\n$$N_{u}(r) = \\frac{r \\, D_{u}(r)}{H_{u}(r)} = \\frac{r \\, (\\pi |b|^{2} r^{2})}{\\pi |b|^{2} r^{3}} = \\frac{\\pi |b|^{2} r^{3}}{\\pi |b|^{2} r^{3}} = 1$$\nThe value $N_{u}(r)$ is constant for all $r \\in (0,1)$. So, $N_{\\mathrm{reg}} = 1$.\n\nPart (2): Model branch point\n\nWe are given the $2$-valued map $U(r e^{\\mathrm{i}\\theta}) = \\left\\{ \\pm \\, r^{\\alpha} \\cos(\\alpha \\theta) \\right\\}$ with $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$. The two sheets are $v_{1}(r, \\theta) = r^{\\alpha} \\cos(\\alpha \\theta)$ and $v_{2}(r, \\theta) = -r^{\\alpha} \\cos(\\alpha \\theta)$. We need to compute $N_{U}(r) = \\frac{r \\, D_{U}(r)}{H_{U}(r)}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the height $H_{U}(r) = \\int_{\\partial B_{r}} \\sum_{i=1}^{2} v_{i}^{2} \\, d\\sigma$.\nThe sum of squares is $v_{1}^{2} + v_{2}^{2} = (r^{\\alpha} \\cos(\\alpha \\theta))^{2} + (-r^{\\alpha} \\cos(\\alpha \\theta))^{2} = 2 r^{2\\alpha} \\cos^{2}(\\alpha \\theta)$.\nOn $\\partial B_r$, the radius is fixed at $r$ and $d\\sigma = r d\\theta$.\n$$H_{U}(r) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} 2 r^{2\\alpha} \\cos^{2}(\\alpha \\theta) \\, r d\\theta = 2 r^{2\\alpha+1} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos^{2}(\\alpha \\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\nWe use $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos^{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{2} \\theta\\right) d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1 + \\cos(3\\theta)}{2} d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\theta + \\frac{1}{3}\\sin(3\\theta) \\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi) = \\pi$$\nThe height is $H_{U}(r) = 2 \\pi r^{2\\alpha+1}$. Substituting $\\alpha=\\frac{3}{2}$, we get $2\\alpha+1 = 2(\\frac{3}{2})+1 = 4$. So, $H_{U}(r) = 2\\pi r^{4}$.\n\nNext, we compute the Dirichlet energy $D_{U}(r) = \\int_{B_{r}} \\sum_{i=1}^{2} |\\nabla v_{i}|^{2} \\, dx$.\nWe work in polar coordinates $(s, \\theta)$, where the area element is $dx = s \\, ds \\, d\\theta$. The gradient squared is $|\\nabla v|^{2} = (\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial s})^{2} + \\frac{1}{s^{2}} (\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\theta})^{2}$.\nLet's compute this for $v_{1}(s, \\theta) = s^{\\alpha} \\cos(\\alpha \\theta)$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial v_{1}}{\\partial s} = \\alpha s^{\\alpha-1} \\cos(\\alpha \\theta)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial v_{1}}{\\partial \\theta} = - \\alpha s^{\\alpha} \\sin(\\alpha \\theta)$$\n$$|\\nabla v_{1}|^{2} = (\\alpha s^{\\alpha-1} \\cos(\\alpha \\theta))^{2} + \\frac{1}{s^{2}}(-\\alpha s^{\\alpha} \\sin(\\alpha \\theta))^{2}$$\n$$|\\nabla v_{1}|^{2} = \\alpha^{2} s^{2\\alpha-2} \\cos^{2}(\\alpha \\theta) + \\alpha^{2} s^{2\\alpha-2} \\sin^{2}(\\alpha \\theta) = \\alpha^{2} s^{2\\alpha-2}(\\cos^{2}(\\alpha \\theta) + \\sin^{2}(\\alpha \\theta)) = \\alpha^{2} s^{2\\alpha-2}$$\nSince $v_{2} = -v_{1}$, we have $\\nabla v_{2} = -\\nabla v_{1}$, and thus $|\\nabla v_{2}|^{2} = |\\nabla v_{1}|^{2}$.\nThe integrand is $\\sum_{i=1}^{2} |\\nabla v_{i}|^{2} = 2 |\\nabla v_{1}|^{2} = 2 \\alpha^{2} s^{2\\alpha-2}$.\nNow we integrate over the disk $B_r$:\n$$D_{U}(r) = \\int_{0}^{r} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} (2 \\alpha^{2} s^{2\\alpha-2}) s \\, d\\theta \\, ds = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{r} 2 \\alpha^{2} s^{2\\alpha-1} \\, ds$$\n$$D_{U}(r) = 4\\pi \\alpha^{2} \\left[ \\frac{s^{2\\alpha}}{2\\alpha} \\right]_{0}^{r} = 4\\pi \\alpha^{2} \\frac{r^{2\\alpha}}{2\\alpha} = 2\\pi \\alpha r^{2\\alpha}$$\nSubstituting $\\alpha=\\frac{3}{2}$, we get $D_{U}(r) = 2\\pi (\\frac{3}{2}) r^{2(3/2)} = 3\\pi r^{3}$.\n\nFinally, we compute Almgren's frequency function $N_{U}(r)$:\n$$N_{U}(r) = \\frac{r \\, D_{U}(r)}{H_{U}(r)} = \\frac{r (3\\pi r^{3})}{2\\pi r^{4}} = \\frac{3\\pi r^{4}}{2\\pi r^{4}} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\nThe value $N_{U}(r)$ is constant for all $r \\in (0,1)$. So, $N_{\\mathrm{branch}} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the ordered pair $(N_{\\mathrm{reg}}, N_{\\mathrm{branch}})$. Based on our calculations, this is $(1, \\frac{3}{2})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\frac{3}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3025294"}]}
