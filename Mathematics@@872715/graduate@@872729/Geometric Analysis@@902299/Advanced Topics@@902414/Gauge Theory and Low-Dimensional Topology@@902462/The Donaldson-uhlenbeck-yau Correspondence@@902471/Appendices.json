We are to use this result to explain the failure of existence of a Hermitian-Einstein metric on $E$ via the Donaldson–Uhlenbeck–Yau (DUY) correspondence. The final answer required is the Harder–Narasimhan slope vector.\n\nFirst, let us establish the foundational definitions. Let $F$ be a holomorphic vector bundle over the compact Kähler manifold $(X, \\omega)$, where $X=\\mathbb{P}^{1}$ has complex dimension $n=1$. The Kähler form $\\omega$ is the Fubini-Study form, normalized such that the degree of the hyperplane bundle $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is $1$.\n\nThe **rank** of $F$, denoted $\\text{rank}(F)$, is the complex dimension of its fibers.\nThe **degree** of $F$ is defined as $\\deg(F) = \\int_{X} c_1(F)$, where $c_1(F)$ is the first Chern class of the determinant line bundle $\\det(F)$. For a line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ on $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$, its degree is $\\deg(\\mathcal{O}(k)) = k$. For a direct sum of bundles, the degree is additive: $\\deg(F_1 \\oplus F_2) = \\deg(F_1) + \\deg(F_2)$.\nThe **slope** of $F$ is the ratio $\\mu(F) = \\frac{\\deg(F)}{\\text{rank}(F)}$.\nA bundle $E$ is **slope-stable** if for every proper, non-zero holomorphic subbundle $F \\subset E$ (i.e., $0  \\text{rank}(F)  \\text{rank}(E)$), the inequality $\\mu(F)  \\mu(E)$ holds. It is **slope-semistable** if $\\mu(F) \\le \\mu(E)$ holds for all such $F$. A bundle that is not semistable is called **unstable**.\nThe **Harder–Narasimhan (HN) filtration** of a bundle $E$ is a unique filtration by saturated holomorphic subbundles $0 = E_0 \\subsetneq E_1 \\subsetneq \\dots \\subsetneq E_k = E$ where each graded quotient $Q_i = E_i/E_{i-1}$ is slope-semistable and the slopes are strictly decreasing: $\\mu(Q_1)  \\mu(Q_2)  \\dots  \\mu(Q_k)$.\n\nLet's apply these definitions to the given bundle $E = \\mathcal{O}(a)\\oplus\\mathcal{O}(b)$ with $a>b$.\n\n1.  **Properties of the bundle $E$**:\n    The rank of $E$ is $\\text{rank}(E) = \\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}(a)) + \\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}(b)) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    The degree of $E$ is $\\deg(E) = \\deg(\\mathcal{O}(a)) + \\deg(\\mathcal{O}(b)) = a+b$.\n    The slope of $E$ is $\\mu(E) = \\frac{\\deg(E)}{\\text{rank}(E)} = \\frac{a+b}{2}$.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Stability and Construction of the HN Filtration**:\n    To determine if $E$ is stable, we must examine its subbundles. According to Grothendieck's splitting theorem, any holomorphic vector bundle on $\\mathbb{P}^1$ splits into a direct sum of line bundles. This simplifies the analysis of subbundles.\n    Consider the natural inclusion of the direct summand $\\mathcal{O}(a)$ into $E$. This gives us a holomorphic subbundle $F = \\mathcal{O}(a)$.\n    The properties of this subbundle are:\n    $\\text{rank}(F) = 1$.\n    $\\deg(F) = a$.\n    $\\mu(F) = \\frac{\\deg(F)}{\\text{rank}(F)} = a$.\n\n    Now we compare the slope of the subbundle $F$ with the slope of the ambient bundle $E$:\n    $\\mu(F) = a$ and $\\mu(E) = \\frac{a+b}{2}$.\n    Since we are given $a > b$, we have $a+a > a+b$, which implies $2a > a+b$, and therefore $a > \\frac{a+b}{2}$.\n    Thus, we have found a subbundle $F = \\mathcal{O}(a)$ such that $\\mu(F) > \\mu(E)$. This violates the condition for slope-semistability, so the bundle $E$ is unstable.\n\n    Since $E$ is unstable, it admits a non-trivial Harder-Narasimhan filtration. For a rank-$2$ bundle, this filtration will be of the form $0 = E_0 \\subsetneq E_1 \\subsetneq E_2 = E$.\n    The subbundle $E_1$ in the HN filtration is the unique saturated subbundle of maximal slope. Any line subbundle $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ of $E = \\mathcal{O}(a)\\oplus\\mathcal{O}(b)$ must have $k \\le a$, because a non-zero homomorphism $\\mathcal{O}(k) \\to \\mathcal{O}(a)\\oplus\\mathcal{O}(b)$ requires a non-zero map to at least one of the components, and $\\text{Hom}(\\mathcal{O}(k), \\mathcal{O}(j)) \\neq 0$ only if $j-k \\ge 0$. Since $a>b$, the highest possible degree for a line subbundle is $a$. The slope of such a subbundle $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ is $k$. To maximize the slope, we must choose the maximal possible degree, which is $a$.\n    So, we identify $E_1$ with the subbundle $\\mathcal{O}(a)$. We must verify that $E_1$ is a saturated subbundle. A subbundle is saturated if the quotient $E/E_1$ is torsion-free. In this case, the quotient is $E/E_1 = (\\mathcal{O}(a)\\oplus\\mathcal{O}(b))/\\mathcal{O}(a) \\cong \\mathcal{O}(b)$. Since $\\mathcal{O}(b)$ is a line bundle, it is locally free and therefore torsion-free. Thus, $E_1 = \\mathcal{O}(a)$ is a saturated subbundle.\n\n    The Harder-Narasimhan filtration of $E$ is therefore:\n    $$0 = E_0 \\subset E_1 = \\mathcal{O}(a) \\subset E_2 = \\mathcal{O}(a)\\oplus\\mathcal{O}(b)$$\n\n3.  **Identification of Graded Quotients and Slopes**:\n    The graded quotients (or HN factors) of this filtration are:\n    $Q_1 = E_1/E_0 = E_1 = \\mathcal{O}(a)$.\n    $Q_2 = E_2/E_1 = (\\mathcal{O}(a)\\oplus\\mathcal{O}(b))/\\mathcal{O}(a) \\cong \\mathcal{O}(b)$.\n\n    Both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are line bundles. A line bundle is always stable, and therefore also semistable.\n    The slopes of these quotients are:\n    $\\mu_1 = \\mu(Q_1) = \\mu(\\mathcal{O}(a)) = \\frac{\\deg(\\mathcal{O}(a))}{\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}(a))} = \\frac{a}{1} = a$.\n    $\\mu_2 = \\mu(Q_2) = \\mu(\\mathcal{O}(b)) = \\frac{\\deg(\\mathcal{O}(b))}{\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}(b))} = \\frac{b}{1} = b$.\n\n    The condition for the HN filtration is that the slopes of the quotients must be strictly decreasing. Indeed, we have $\\mu_1 = a$ and $\\mu_2 = b$, and we are given $a > b$, so $\\mu_1 > \\mu_2$. This confirms that we have correctly identified the HN filtration.\n    The corresponding Harder-Narasimhan slope vector for $E$ is $(\\mu_1, \\mu_2)$.\n\n4.  **Implications for the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau Correspondence**:\n    The Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem states that a holomorphic vector bundle admits a Hermitian-Einstein metric if and only if it is **polystable**. A bundle is polystable if it is a direct sum of stable bundles, all of which have the same slope.\n    The bundle in question is $E = \\mathcal{O}(a) \\oplus \\mathcal{O}(b)$. It is a direct sum of $\\mathcal{O}(a)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(b)$. As line bundles, $\\mathcal{O}(a)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(b)$ are stable. However, for $E$ to be polystable, its stable summands must have the same slope.\n    The slopes are $\\mu(\\mathcal{O}(a)) = a$ and $\\mu(\\mathcal{O}(b)) = b$.\n    Since $a > b$, the slopes are unequal. Therefore, $E$ is not a polystable bundle.\n    According to the DUY correspondence, because $E$ is not polystable, it cannot admit a Hermitian-Einstein metric.\n    Our explicit computation of the Harder-Narasimhan filtration serves as the definitive proof of this conclusion. The existence of a non-trivial HN filtration (i.e., one where the graded pieces are proper subquotients) with strictly decreasing slopes demonstrates that the bundle is unstable. An unstable bundle cannot be polystable, as polystability implies semistability. The fact that $\\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2$ is the direct contradiction to the polystability condition.\n\nThe Harder-Narasimhan slope vector of $E$ is $(\\mu_1, \\mu_2)=(a,b)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na  b\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3034918"}, {"introduction": "When a vector bundle is polystable and thus admits a Hermitian-Einstein metric, its curvature satisfies the equation $\\sqrt{-1}\\,\\Lambda_\\omega F_h=\\lambda\\,\\mathrm{Id}_E$.
