The concepts of Hilbert spaces, bounded linear operators, compact operators, and Fredholm operators are all well-established and fundamental. The problem is firmly grounded in mathematical theory.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for the construction of an operator with specific properties. Such operators exist, and the properties can be rigorously verified. The most common examples are the unilateral shift operators. The problem is well-posed as it admits a unique and meaningful solution for any valid construction.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise mathematical language. The terms used ($\\ell^{2}$ space, bounded linear operator, compact operator, Fredholm operator, Fredholm index) have unambiguous, standard definitions in mathematics. There is no subjective or opinion-based content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and conforms to all criteria for a solvable mathematical problem. Proceeding to the solution.\n\nWe will construct the unilateral right shift operator and verify its properties.\n\nLet $\\ell^{2}$ be the Hilbert space of complex sequences $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots)$ such that $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} |x_k|^{2}  \\infty$. The inner product is $\\langle x, y \\rangle = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x_k \\overline{y_k}$ and the norm is $\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle x, x \\rangle}$.\n\n**1. Construction of the Operator**\nWe define the operator $T: \\ell^{2} \\to \\ell^{2}$ as the unilateral right shift operator, which we will denote by $S$. For any sequence $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots) \\in \\ell^{2}$, its action is given by:\n$$S(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots) = (0, x_1, x_2, \\dots)$$\n\n**2. Verification of Properties**\n\n**A. Bounded Linear Operator**\n- **Linearity**: Let $x, y \\in \\ell^{2}$ and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n$$S(\\alpha x + \\beta y) = S(\\alpha x_1 + \\beta y_1, \\alpha x_2 + \\beta y_2, \\dots)$$\n$$= (0, \\alpha x_1 + \\beta y_1, \\alpha x_2 + \\beta y_2, \\dots)$$\n$$= (0, \\alpha x_1, \\alpha x_2, \\dots) + (0, \\beta y_1, \\beta y_2, \\dots)$$\n$$= \\alpha(0, x_1, x_2, \\dots) + \\beta(0, y_1, y_2, \\dots) = \\alpha S(x) + \\beta S(y)$$\nThus, $S$ is a linear operator.\n- **Boundedness**: We compute the norm of $S(x)$:\n$$\\|S(x)\\|^{2} = |0|^{2} + |x_1|^{2} + |x_2|^{2} + \\dots = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} |x_k|^{2} = \\|x\\|^{2}$$\nThis shows that $\\|S(x)\\| = \\|x\\|$ for all $x \\in \\ell^{2}$. The operator norm is $\\|S\\| = \\sup_{\\|x\\|=1} \\|S(x)\\| = \\sup_{\\|x\\|=1} \\|x\\| = 1$. Since the norm is finite, $S$ is a bounded operator.\n\n**B. Not a Compact Operator**\nA linear operator $K$ on a Banach space is compact if for every bounded sequence $(x_n)$, the sequence $(Kx_n)$ contains a convergent subsequence.\nLet $\\{e_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be the standard orthonormal basis for $\\ell^{2}$, where $e_n$ is the sequence with a $1$ in the $n$-th position and $0$s elsewhere. The sequence $(e_n)$ is bounded, as $\\|e_n\\| = 1$ for all $n$.\nLet us examine the sequence $(Se_n)$:\n$$S(e_n) = e_{n+1}$$\nThe sequence of images is $(Se_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} = (e_2, e_3, e_4, \\dots)$. This is an orthonormal sequence. For any two distinct terms $Se_n = e_{n+1}$ and $Se_m = e_{m+1}$ with $n \\neq m$, we have:\n$$\\|Se_n - Se_m\\|^{2} = \\|e_{n+1} - e_{m+1}\\|^{2} = \\langle e_{n+1} - e_{m+1}, e_{n+1} - e_{m+1} \\rangle$$\n$$= \\|e_{n+1}\\|^{2} - \\langle e_{n+1}, e_{m+1} \\rangle - \\langle e_{m+1}, e_{n+1} \\rangle + \\|e_{m+1}\\|^{2}$$\nSince the basis is orthonormal, $\\langle e_{j}, e_{k} \\rangle = \\delta_{jk}$, so $\\langle e_{n+1}, e_{m+1} \\rangle = 0$.\n$$\\|Se_n - Se_m\\|^{2} = 1^{2} - 0 - 0 + 1^{2} = 2$$\nTherefore, $\\|Se_n - Se_m\\| = \\sqrt{2}$ for all $n \\neq m$.\nA sequence $(y_n)$ can only contain a convergent subsequence if it contains a Cauchy subsequence. The sequence $(Se_n)$ cannot contain a Cauchy subsequence because the distance between any two distinct terms is fixed at $\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, $(Se_n)$ has no convergent subsequence.\nSince we found a bounded sequence $(e_n)$ for which the image sequence $(Se_n)$ has no convergent subsequence, the operator $S$ is not compact.\n\n**C. Fredholm Operator**\nAn operator $T$ is Fredholm if its kernel is finite-dimensional, its range is closed, and its cokernel is finite-dimensional.\n- **Kernel of S**: The kernel of $S$ is the set $\\ker(S) = \\{x \\in \\ell^{2} \\mid S(x) = 0\\}$.\n$$S(x) = (0, x_1, x_2, \\dots) = (0, 0, 0, \\dots)$$\nThis implies that $x_k = 0$ for all $k \\geq 1$. Therefore, $x$ must be the zero vector.\n$$\\ker(S) = \\{0\\}$$\nThe dimension of the kernel is $\\dim(\\ker(S)) = 0$, which is finite.\n\n- **Range of S and its closure**: The range of $S$ is the set $\\text{ran}(S) = \\{y \\in \\ell^{2} \\mid y = S(x) \\text{ for some } x \\in \\ell^{2}\\}$.\nFrom the definition of $S$, any vector $y \\in \\text{ran}(S)$ must have its first component equal to $0$. Let's denote the first component of $y$ by $y_1$.\n$$\\text{ran}(S) = \\{y = (y_1, y_2, \\dots) \\in \\ell^{2} \\mid y_1 = 0\\}$$\nTo show this subspace is closed, let $(y^{(n)})$ be a sequence in $\\text{ran}(S)$ that converges to a limit $y \\in \\ell^{2}$. For each $n$, $y^{(n)}_1 = 0$. Since convergence in $\\ell^{2}$ implies coordinate-wise convergence, we have $y_1 = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y^{(n)}_1 = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 0 = 0$. Thus, the limit vector $y$ has its first component equal to $0$, which means $y \\in \\text{ran}(S)$. Therefore, $\\text{ran}(S)$ is a closed subspace of $\\ell^{2}$.\n\n- **Cokernel of S**: The cokernel of $S$ is the quotient space $\\text{coker}(S) = \\ell^{2} / \\text{ran}(S)$. The dimension of the cokernel is the codimension of the range. For a closed subspace $M$ of a Hilbert space $H$, we have the isomorphism $H/M \\cong M^{\\perp}$, where $M^{\\perp}$ is the orthogonal complement of $M$.\nThus, $\\dim(\\text{coker}(S)) = \\dim((\\text{ran}(S))^{\\perp})$.\nLet's find the orthogonal complement of $\\text{ran}(S)$. A vector $z = (z_1, z_2, \\dots) \\in \\ell^{2}$ is in $(\\text{ran}(S))^{\\perp}$ if and only if $\\langle z, y \\rangle = 0$ for all $y \\in \\text{ran}(S)$.\nFor any $k \\geq 2$, the basis vector $e_k$ is in $\\text{ran}(S)$ since $e_k = S(e_{k-1})$. Therefore, for $z \\in (\\text{ran}(S))^{\\perp}$, we must have:\n$$\\langle z, e_k \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\geq 2$$\nThe inner product gives $\\langle z, e_k \\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} z_j \\overline{(e_k)_j} = z_k$.\nSo, we must have $z_k = 0$ for all $k \\geq 2$. This means $z$ must be of the form $(z_1, 0, 0, \\dots) = z_1 e_1$.\n$$(\\text{ran}(S))^{\\perp} = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\}$$\nThe dimension of this subspace is $1$.\n$$\\dim(\\text{coker}(S)) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{e_1\\}) = 1$$\nThis dimension is finite.\n\nSince $\\dim(\\ker(S))=0$, $\\text{ran}(S)$ is closed, and $\\dim(\\text{coker}(S))=1$, the operator $S$ is a Fredholm operator by definition.\n\n**3. Computation of the Fredholm Index**\nThe Fredholm index of an operator $T$ is defined as:\n$$\\text{ind}(T) = \\dim(\\ker(T)) - \\dim(\\text{coker}(T))$$\nFor our operator $S$, we have found $\\dim(\\ker(S))=0$ and $\\dim(\\text{coker}(S))=1$.\n$$\\text{ind}(S) = 0 - 1 = -1$$\nThe Fredholm index of the right shift operator is $-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "3028097"}, {"introduction": "This next exercise elevates the concept by exploring how the index is revealed in more abstract algebraic structures, particularly those that are precursors to geometric settings like Dirac operators [@problem_id:3028128].

This is a classic result in the index theory of elliptic operators on manifolds with cylindrical ends.\n\nThe Fredholm index of $D_{\\delta}$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ind}(D_{\\delta}) = \\dim \\ker(D_{\\delta}) - \\dim \\mathrm{coker}(D_{\\delta})\n$$\nThe values of $\\delta$ for which $D_{\\delta}$ is not Fredholm are precisely the eigenvalues of $A$, known as the indicial roots. The index is constant on any interval $(\\lambda_i, \\lambda_{i+1})$ between two consecutive indicial roots. We are interested in the jump of the index when $\\delta$ crosses the indicial root $\\lambda_3 = 3$.\n\nA key result in this theory states that for an operator of the form $D = \\partial_t + A$ with $A$ self-adjoint, the jump in the index as the weight $\\delta$ increases across an eigenvalue $\\lambda_0$ of $A$ is given by minus the multiplicity of that eigenvalue.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ind}(D_{\\delta_{+}}) - \\mathrm{Ind}(D_{\\delta_{-}}) = -m_0,\n$$\nwhere $m_0$ is the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 \\in (\\delta_{-}, \\delta_{+})$. Let's briefly explain why this is the case.\n\nThe dimension of the kernel, $\\dim\\ker(D_\\delta)$, changes because membership in the weighted space depends on the asymptotic decay rate of solutions to $Du=0$. A solution on the cylindrical end has the form $u(t,y) \\sim e^{-\\lambda_j t} v_j(y)$ where $Av_j = \\lambda_j v_j$. Such a solution belongs to the weighted space $W^{1,2}_\\delta$ if and only if $\\delta  \\lambda_j$. As $\\delta$ increases past an eigenvalue $\\lambda_0$, solutions corresponding to that eigenvalue are no longer in the kernel because they fail the decay condition. Thus, the kernel dimension decreases by the number of such solutions, which is the multiplicity $m_0$.\n$$\n\\Delta(\\dim \\ker) = \\dim \\ker(D_{\\delta_{+}}) - \\dim \\ker(D_{\\delta_{-}}) = -m_0\n$$\n\nThe dimension of the cokernel, $\\dim \\mathrm{coker}(D_\\delta) = \\dim \\ker(D_\\delta^*)$, also changes. The formal adjoint operator on the cylinder is $D^* = -\\partial_t + A$ (since $A$ is self-adjoint). A solution to the adjoint equation $D^*w=0$ has the form $w(t,y) \\sim e^{\\lambda_j t}v_j(y)$. For this to belong to the dual weighted space (which has weight $-\\delta$), we need $-\\delta > \\lambda_j$, or $\\delta  -\\lambda_j$. As $\\delta$ increases past $\\lambda_0 > 0$, it is moving away from any values $-\\lambda_j$, so the dimension of the cokernel does not change due to solutions decaying at $+\\infty$. For an operator of the form $\\partial_t+A$, it is a standard result that the dimension of the cokernel remains constant as $\\delta$ crosses an eigenvalue of $A$.\n$$\n\\Delta(\\dim \\mathrm{coker}) = \\dim \\mathrm{coker}(D_{\\delta_{+}}) - \\dim \\mathrm{coker}(D_{\\delta_{-}}) = 0\n$$\n\nCombining these, the index jump is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ind}(D_{\\delta_{+}}) - \\mathrm{Ind}(D_{\\delta_{-}}) = \\Delta(\\dim \\ker) - \\Delta(\\dim \\mathrm{coker}) = -m_0 - 0 = -m_0\n$$\n\nIn our specific problem, the weight $\\delta$ increases from $\\delta_{-} = 2.6$ to $\\delta_{+} = 3.4$. The only eigenvalue (indicial root) crossed in this interval is $\\lambda_3 = 3$. The multiplicity of this eigenvalue is given as $m_3 = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the index jump is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ind}(D_{3.4}) - \\mathrm{Ind}(D_{2.6}) = -m_3 = -4\n$$\nThis jump is equal to the negative of the dimension of the space of \"extended solutions\" at the threshold, which are solutions that behave like $e^{-3t}v(y)$ on the cylindrical end, where $v$ is an eigensection for the eigenvalue 3. The dimension of this space of sections $v$ is precisely the multiplicity, $m_3=4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-4}\n$$", "id": "3028106"}]}
