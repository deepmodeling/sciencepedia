This yields the relation:\n$$c\\left(\\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus (n+1)}\\right) = c(\\mathcal{O}) \\cdot c(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n})$$\nTo find an expression for $c(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n})$, we must first determine the total Chern classes $c(\\mathcal{O})$ and $c\\left(\\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus (n+1)}\\right)$.\n\n1.  **Total Chern class of the trivial line bundle, $c(\\mathcal{O})$:**\n    The trivial line bundle $\\mathcal{O}$ is flat, so all its Chern classes of positive degree are zero. Specifically, its first Chern class is $c_{1}(\\mathcal{O}) = 0$. For any line bundle $L$, its total Chern class is given by $c(L) = 1 + c_{1}(L)$. Therefore, for the trivial bundle $\\mathcal{O}$:\n    $$c(\\mathcal{O}) = 1 + c_{1}(\\mathcal{O}) = 1 + 0 = 1$$\n\n2.  **Total Chern class of the direct sum, $c\\left(\\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus (n+1)}\\right)$:**\n    Another fundamental property of Chern classes, which follows from the splitting principle, is that the total Chern class of a direct sum of vector bundles is the cup product of their individual total Chern classes. For $E = V_{1} \\oplus V_{2} \\oplus \\dots \\oplus V_{k}$, we have $c(E) = c(V_{1}) c(V_{2}) \\cdots c(V_{k})$.\n    In our case, the bundle is a direct sum of $n+1$ identical copies of the hyperplane line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(1)$:\n    $$c\\left(\\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus (n+1)}\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n+1} c(\\mathcal{O}(1)) = \\left(c(\\mathcal{O}(1))\\right)^{n+1}$$\n    The problem states that the first Chern class of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is $h \\in H^{2}(\\mathbb{C}P^{n};\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is a line bundle, its total Chern class is:\n    $$c(\\mathcal{O}(1)) = 1 + c_{1}(\\mathcal{O}(1)) = 1 + h$$\n    Substituting this result into the expression for the direct sum, we obtain:\n    $$c\\left(\\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus (n+1)}\\right) = (1 + h)^{n+1}$$\n\nNow we substitute these computed total Chern classes back into the original equation from the Whitney sum formula:\n$$\\underbrace{(1 + h)^{n+1}}_{c\\left(\\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus (n+1)}\\right)} = \\underbrace{1}_{c(\\mathcal{O})} \\cdot c(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n})$$\nSolving for $c(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n})$, we arrive at the closed-form expression for the total Chern class of the tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}$:\n$$c(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n}) = (1 + h)^{n+1}$$\nThis expression is an element of the cohomology ring $H^{\\ast}(\\mathbb{C}P^{n};\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nFinally, we use this result to verify the identity $c_{1}(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n}) = (n+1)h$. The total Chern class is by definition the sum of the individual Chern classes: $c(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} c_{k}(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n})$. The class $c_{k}$ resides in $H^{2k}(\\mathbb{C}P^n; \\mathbb{Z})$. In our polynomial representation, this corresponds to the coefficient of $h^k$. We can expand our derived expression for $c(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n})$ using the binomial theorem:\n$$c(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n}) = (1 + h)^{n+1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \\binom{n+1}{k} h^k = 1 + \\binom{n+1}{1}h + \\binom{n+1}{2}h^2 + \\dots$$\nThe first Chern class, $c_{1}(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n})$, is the component in degree $2$, which corresponds to the term with $h^{1}$. By comparing the expansion with the definition of the total Chern class, we identify:\n$$c_{1}(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n}) = \\binom{n+1}{1}h = (n+1)h$$\nThis verifies the required identity. The calculation takes place in the ring $H^{\\ast}(\\mathbb{C}P^{n};\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[h]/(h^{n+1})$, where the relation $h^{n+1}=0$ holds. Our full expression for the total Chern class is $c(T\\mathbb{C}P^{n}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n+1}{k} h^k$, which is precisely the polynomial $(1+h)^{n+1}$ truncated by the relation $h^{n+1}=0$. The compact form $(1+h)^{n+1}$ is the standard and most useful representation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(1+h)^{n+1}}\n$$", "id": "3026504"}, {"introduction": "After determining the characteristic classes of an ambient space like $\\mathbb{C}P^n$, a natural next step is to study the geometry of its submanifolds.
