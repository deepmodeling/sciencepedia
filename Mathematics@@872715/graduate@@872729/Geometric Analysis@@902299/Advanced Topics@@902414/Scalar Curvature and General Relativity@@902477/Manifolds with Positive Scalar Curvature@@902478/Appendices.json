It is a well-defined question in differential geometry that is scientifically sound, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\n### Derivation of Scalar Curvature\n\nWe begin with the general formula for the scalar curvature $\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}$ of a warped product manifold $M = B \\times_f F$ with metric $g = g_B + f^2 g_F$. Let $\\dim(B) = m$ and $\\dim(F) = k$. The formula is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Scal}_{g} = \\operatorname{Scal}_{g_B} + \\frac{1}{f^2}\\operatorname{Scal}_{g_F} - \\frac{2k}{f} \\Delta_B f - \\frac{k(k-1)}{f^2} |\\nabla_B f|_{g_B}^2\n$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{Scal}_{g_B}$ and $\\operatorname{Scal}_{g_F}$ are the scalar curvatures of the base manifold $(B, g_B)$ and fiber manifold $(F, g_F)$ respectively. $\\Delta_B$ and $\\nabla_B$ are the Laplace-Beltrami operator and the gradient on the base manifold $(B, g_B)$.\n\nIn the given problem, we have:\n- **Base Manifold**: $(B, g_B) = (I, dt^2)$. This is a $1$-dimensional interval with the standard Euclidean metric. Thus, $m=1$.\n- **Fiber Manifold**: $(F, g_F) = (S^{n-1}, g_{S^{n-1}})$. The dimension is $k = n-1$.\n\nWe now compute each term in the general formula for our specific case.\n\n1.  **Curvature of the Base**: The base manifold $(I, dt^2)$ is a one-dimensional real interval, which is intrinsically flat. Therefore, its scalar curvature is zero:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{Scal}_{g_B} = 0\n    $$\n\n2.  **Curvature of the Fiber**: The fiber is the $(n-1)$-dimensional unit sphere $S^{n-1}$ with its standard round metric of constant sectional curvature $K = +1$. The scalar curvature of a $k$-dimensional manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$ is given by $k(k-1)K$. For the fiber, $k=n-1$, so:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{Scal}_{g_F} = (n-1)((n-1)-1)(+1) = (n-1)(n-2)\n    $$\n\n3.  **Gradient of the Warping Function**: The warping function $f(t)$ depends only on the coordinate $t$ of the base manifold $I$. The gradient $\\nabla_B f$ on $(I, dt^2)$ is given by:\n    $$\n    \\nabla_B f = \\frac{df}{dt} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = f'(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\n    $$\n    The squared norm of this gradient with respect to the metric $g_B = dt^2$ is:\n    $$\n    |\\nabla_B f|_{g_B}^2 = g_B\\left(f'(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, f'(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right) = (f'(t))^2\n    $$\n\n4.  **Laplacian of the Warping Function**: The Laplace-Beltrami operator on $(I, dt^2)$ acting on a function $f(t)$ is simply the second derivative with respect to $t$. In coordinates, $\\Delta_B f = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}} \\partial_i (\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} g^{ij} \\partial_j f)$. Here, $g_{tt}=1$, $g^{tt}=1$, and $\\det(g_{ij})=1$, so:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_B f = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(1 \\cdot \\frac{df}{dt}\\right) = \\frac{d^2f}{dt^2} = f''(t)\n    $$\n\nNow, we substitute these components back into the general formula for $\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}$. We have $k = n-1$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}(t) = 0 + \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{f(t)^2} - \\frac{2(n-1)}{f(t)} f''(t) - \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{f(t)^2} (f'(t))^2\n$$\nCombining the terms with $f(t)^2$ in the denominator, we arrive at the final expression for the scalar curvature:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}(t) = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{f(t)^2} \\left[1 - (f'(t))^2\\right] - \\frac{2(n-1)}{f(t)} f''(t)\n$$\nThis can be written in a more compact form:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}(t) = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)(1 - (f'(t))^2)}{f(t)^2} - \\frac{2(n-1)f''(t)}{f(t)}\n$$\n\n### Condition for Positive Scalar Curvature (PSC)\n\nThe problem asks for the pointwise conditions on $f$ that ensure PSC, i.e., $\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}(t) > 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)(1 - (f'(t))^2)}{f(t)^2} - \\frac{2(n-1)f''(t)}{f(t)} > 0\n$$\nSince $n \\ge 3$, the term $n-1$ is positive. We can divide the inequality by $n-1$ without changing its direction:\n$$\n\\frac{(n-2)(1 - (f'(t))^2)}{f(t)^2} - \\frac{2f''(t)}{f(t)} > 0\n$$\nGiven that $f(t) > 0$, we can multiply by $f(t)^2$ to clear the denominators:\n$$\n(n-2)(1 - (f'(t))^2) - 2f(t)f''(t) > 0\n$$\nThis inequality is the pointwise condition on the warping function $f(t)$ for the manifold to have positive scalar curvature. For instance, a sufficient (but not necessary) set of conditions could be that $f$ is concave ($f''(t) \\le 0$) and its slope is controlled, $|f'(t)|  1$. Another important case is $f''(t) = -\\frac{n-2}{2f(t)}(1-(f')^2)$, which yields zero scalar curvature. Any function $f$ satisfying the strict inequality above will generate a metric with PSC. A classic example is the round sphere $S^n$ itself, which can be described by a metric of this form with $f(t)=\\cos(t)$ on $I=(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$, for which the inequality becomes $n(\\cos(t))^2 > 0$, which holds on the open interval.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be the closed-form expression for $\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}(t)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)(1 - (f'(t))^2)}{f(t)^2} - \\frac{2(n-1)f''(t)}{f(t)}}\n$$", "id": "3032064"}, {"introduction": "With the curvature formula for warped products in hand, we can move from calculation to creation.

Thus, its intrinsic curvature is zero, $R_B=0$. The dimension is $k=1$.\n-   The fiber is the $(n-1)$-sphere $S^{n-1}$ with the standard metric $g_{S^{n-1}}$ of constant sectional curvature $+1$. The dimension of the fiber is $m=n-1$. The scalar curvature $R_F$ of a space of constant sectional curvature $K$ is $m(m-1)K$. Here, $m=n-1$ and $K=1$, so $R_F = (n-1)(n-1-1)(1) = (n-1)(n-2)$.\n-   The warping function $f$ depends only on the base coordinate $r$.

For $r \\in (0,L)$, the function $f(r)>0$ and $n \\geq 3$, so the prefactor $\\frac{n-1}{f(r)^2}$ is strictly positive. The sign of $R_g(r)$ is determined by the sign of the expression in the brackets:\n$$S(r) = (n-2)(1 - (f'(r))^2) - 2f(r)f''(r)$$\nThe properties of a torpedo profile are:\n(i) $f(r) \\equiv \\rho > 0$ on a closed interval $I=[a, a+\\ell] \\subset (0,L)$.\n(ii) $f''(r) \\leq 0$ for all $r \\in (0,L/2]$.\n(iii) $f'(r)$ is nonincreasing on $[0,L/2]$, which implies $0 \\leq f'(r) \\leq 1$ on this interval, given $f'(0)=1$ and the existence of a cylindrical part where $f'(r)=0$.\n\nLet's analyze $S(r)$ on different parts of the interval $(0,L)$. By the symmetry condition $f(L-r)=f(r)$, it suffices to analyze $r \\in (0, L/2]$.\n-   For $r \\in (0, L/2]$, property (iii) states $0 \\leq f'(r) \\leq 1$, so $(f'(r))^2 \\leq 1$. This implies $1 - (f'(r))^2 \\geq 0$. As $n \\geq 3$, the term $(n-2)(1 - (f'(r))^2)$ is non-negative.\n-   For $r \\in (0, L/2]$, property (ii) states $f''(r) \\leq 0$. Since $f(r)>0$, the term $-2f(r)f''(r)$ is also non-negative.\n-   Thus, $S(r)$ is the sum of two non-negative terms for $r \\in (0, L/2]$, which means $R_g(r) \\geq 0$.\n\nTo show strict positivity, we must demonstrate that both terms do not vanish simultaneously.\n-   Consider the region $(0,a)$, which is the part of the profile before the cylindrical band. For the smooth function $f$ to connect the pole (where $f'(0)=1$) to the cylinder (where $f'(r)=0$ for $r \\geq a$), its derivative $f'(r)$ must be strictly between $0$ and $1$ for $r \\in (0,a)$. Therefore, $1 - (f'(r))^2 > 0$ on $(0,a)$. The first term of $S(r)$, $(n-2)(1 - (f'(r))^2)$, is strictly positive on $(0,a)$. Since the second term $-2f(r)f''(r)$ is non-negative, their sum $S(r)$ is strictly positive.\n-   Consider the interior of the cylindrical band, $r \\in (a, a+\\ell)$. Here, $f(r)=\\rho$, so $f'(r)=0$ and $f''(r)=0$.\n    $$S(r) = (n-2)(1-0^2) - 2\\rho(0) = n-2$$\n    Since $n \\geq 3$, $S(r)=n-2 \\geq 1 > 0$. Thus, $R_g(r)$ is strictly positive on the cylindrical band.\n-   At the connection points, like $r=a$, smoothness of $f$ ensures $f'(a)=0$ and $f''(a)=0$. So $R_g(a)$ is also positive for the same reason.\n\nBy symmetry, the scalar curvature is also strictly positive on $(L/2,L)$. Therefore, for any torpedo profile, the metric $g$ has strictly positive scalar curvature for all $r \\in (0,L)$.\n\nSecond, we explain why the metric does not have constant sectional curvature. A warped product metric of the form $dr^2 + f(r)^2 g_{S^{n-1}}$ has constant sectional curvature $K$ if and only if the warping function $f(r)$ has one of the following forms:\n-   $f(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{K}}\\sin(\\sqrt{K}r)$ for $K>0$.\n-   $f(r) = r$ for $K=0$.\n-   $f(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{-K}}\\sinh(\\sqrt{-K}r)$ for $K0$.\nEach of these functions is analytic. An analytic function that is constant on any open interval must be constant everywhere. The torpedo profile specifies that $f(r) \\equiv \\rho$ on the interval $I=[a, a+\\ell]$, but $f(r)$ is not constant everywhere (e.g., $f(0)=0 \\neq \\rho$). Therefore, the warping function $f(r)$ for a torpedo profile cannot be one of the functions required for constant sectional curvature. Consequently, the resulting metric $g$ does not have constant sectional curvature.\n\n(3) Computation of the scalar curvature on the cylindrical band.\n\nOn the equatorial cylindrical band $I=[a, a+\\ell]$, the warping function is constant: $f(r) \\equiv \\rho$.\nThis implies that its first and second derivatives are zero for any $r$ in the interior of $I$:\n$$f'(r) = 0$$\n$$f''(r) = 0$$\nDue to the smoothness requirement on $f$, these conditions also hold at the endpoints of the interval $I$.\nWe substitute these values into the scalar curvature formula derived in part (1):\n$$R_g(r) = \\frac{n-1}{f(r)^2} \\left[ (n-2)(1 - (f'(r))^2) - 2f(r)f''(r) \\right]$$\n$$R_g(r) = \\frac{n-1}{\\rho^2} \\left[ (n-2)(1 - 0^2) - 2\\rho(0) \\right]$$\n$$R_g(r) = \\frac{n-1}{\\rho^2} \\left[ (n-2)(1) - 0 \\right]$$\n$$R_g(r) = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{\\rho^2}$$\nThis is the constant value of the scalar curvature on the entire cylindrical band $I$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{\\rho^2}}$$", "id": "3032119"}, {"introduction": "The existence of a positive scalar curvature metric is not merely a geometric curiosity; it imposes profound constraints on the topology of a manifold.

The problem states we may assume the Gromov–Lawson connected sum theorem. The dimension of our manifolds is $n = 2m-1$. Since $m \\geq 2$, the dimension is $n \\geq 3$. The theorem states that if two closed manifolds of dimension at least $3$ admit metrics of positive scalar curvature, so does their connected sum.\n\nSince both $L_1$ and $L_2$ have metrics of positive scalar curvature, the theorem directly implies that their connected sum, $M$, also admits a metric $g$ with positive scalar curvature, $\\kappa_g > 0$, everywhere on $M$. The construction of $g$ involves a careful surgery procedure, where the metrics $g_1$ and $g_2$ on $L_1 \\setminus B_1$ and $L_2 \\setminus B_2$ are smoothly joined by a \"neck\" or \"bridge\" region (diffeomorphic to $S^{2m-2} \\times I$) whose metric is specifically constructed to have positive scalar curvature. The existence of such a neck metric is guaranteed for dimensions $n \\geq 3$.\n\n**Task 2: Spin Structure of M and Definition of the Rosenberg Index**\n\nA smooth manifold is called spin if its second Stiefel-Whitney class, $w_2$, vanishes. For a connected sum of two manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$, the second Stiefel-Whitney class satisfies $w_2(M_1 \\# M_2) = w_2(M_1) + w_2(M_2)$.\n\nWe must determine if $L^{2m-1}(p)$ and $L^{2m-1}(r)$ are spin. A standard result in algebraic topology states that the odd-dimensional lens space $L^{2k-1}(n)$ is spin if and only if $n$ is an odd integer. In our problem, the dimension is $2m-1$, and the orders of the cyclic groups are $p$ and $r$. We are given that $p$ and $r$ are odd integers. Therefore, both $L^{2m-1}(p)$ and $L^{2m-1}(r)$ are spin manifolds.\n\nThis implies their second Stiefel-Whitney classes are zero:\n$$w_2(L^{2m-1}(p)) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad w_2(L^{2m-1}(r)) = 0$$\nConsequently, for the connected sum $M$, we have:\n$$w_2(M) = w_2(L^{2m-1}(p)) + w_2(L^{2m-1}(r)) = 0 + 0 = 0$$\nThus, $M$ is a spin manifold.\n\nAs a closed spin manifold, $M$ possesses a spin structure and a corresponding spin Dirac operator, which we denote by $D$. The fundamental group is $\\Gamma = \\pi_1(M)$. The Rosenberg index, $\\alpha(M)$, is defined as the higher index of the spin Dirac operator twisted by the Mishchenko-Fomenko bundle. This bundle is a flat $C^*_r(\\Gamma)$-vector bundle over $M$ associated with the left regular representation of $\\Gamma$ on the Hilbert space $\\ell^2(\\Gamma)$. Let this twisted Dirac operator be $D_E$. The Rosenberg index is its K-theory index class:\n$$\\alpha(M) := \\text{ind}(D_E) \\in K_{2m-1}(C^*_r(\\Gamma))$$\nwhere $2m-1$ is the dimension of $M$.\n\n**Task 3: Computation of the Rosenberg Index $\\alpha(M)$**\n\nFrom Task 1, we have a metric $g$ on $M$ with strictly positive scalar curvature, $\\kappa_g(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in M$. Since $M$ is compact, there exists a constant $\\kappa_0 > 0$ such that $\\kappa_g(x) \\geq \\kappa_0$ for all $x \\in M$.\n\nThe problem provides the Lichnerowicz formula for the *square* of the Dirac operator. A generalized version of this formula applies to the twisted operator $D_E$:\n$$D_E^2 = \\nabla_E^* \\nabla_E + \\frac{\\kappa_g}{4} \\text{Id}$$\nHere, $\\nabla_E$ is the connection on the twisted spinor bundle (spinor bundle tensored with the Mishchenko-Fomenko bundle $E$), $\\nabla_E^* \\nabla_E$ is the connection Laplacian, and $\\text{Id}$ is the identity operator.\n\nThe operator $\\nabla_E^* \\nabla_E$ is a non-negative operator. That is, for any smooth section $\\psi$ of the twisted spinor bundle, the $L^2$-inner product satisfies $\\langle \\nabla_E^* \\nabla_E \\psi, \\psi \\rangle = \\langle \\nabla_E \\psi, \\nabla_E \\psi \\rangle_{L^2} = \\|\\nabla_E \\psi\\|_{L^2}^2 \\geq 0$.\n\nNow consider the inner product $\\langle D_E^2 \\psi, \\psi \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle D_E^2 \\psi, \\psi \\rangle = \\langle (\\nabla_E^* \\nabla_E + \\frac{\\kappa_g}{4}) \\psi, \\psi \\rangle = \\|\\nabla_E \\psi\\|_{L^2}^2 + \\frac{1}{4} \\int_M \\kappa_g(x) |\\psi(x)|_x^2 \\, dV_g$$\nUsing the fact that $\\kappa_g(x) \\geq \\kappa_0 > 0$, we can establish a lower bound:\n$$\\langle D_E^2 \\psi, \\psi \\rangle \\geq 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\int_M \\kappa_0 |\\psi(x)|_x^2 \\, dV_g = \\frac{\\kappa_0}{4} \\|\\psi\\|_{L^2}^2$$\nThis inequality shows that if $\\psi$ is a non-zero section, then $\\langle D_E^2 \\psi, \\psi \\rangle > 0$. This means that $0$ is not an eigenvalue of the operator $D_E^2$. Since $D_E$ is a self-adjoint operator, its spectrum is real. If $\\lambda$ were an eigenvalue of $D_E$, then $\\lambda^2$ would be an eigenvalue of $D_E^2$. As $0$ is not an eigenvalue of $D_E^2$, $0$ cannot be an eigenvalue of $D_E$. Therefore, the kernel of $D_E$ is trivial, $\\ker(D_E) = \\{0\\}$, which implies that the operator $D_E$ is invertible.\n\nThe Rosenberg index $\\alpha(M) = \\text{ind}(D_E)$ is an element of the K-theory group $K_{2m-1}(C^*_r(\\Gamma))$. In operator K-theory, the index class of an invertible operator is the zero element of the group. The K-theory index essentially measures the obstruction to deforming an operator into an invertible one. Since our operator $D_E$ is already invertible (due to the existence of the PSC metric), there is no obstruction, and its index class is trivial.\n\nTherefore, the value of the Rosenberg index is zero.\n$$\\alpha(M) = 0$$\n\n**Task 4: Summary and Influence of the Fundamental Group**\n\nThe fundamental group of the connected sum $M = L^{2m-1}(p) \\# L^{2m-1}(r)$ is given by the free product of the fundamental groups of the constituent manifolds:\n$$\\Gamma = \\pi_1(M) \\cong \\pi_1(L^{2m-1}(p)) * \\pi_1(L^{2m-1}(r))$$\nThe fundamental group of the lens space $L^{n}(k)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_k$. Thus,\n$$\\Gamma \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_p * \\mathbb{Z}_r$$\nSince $p \\geq 3$ and $r \\geq 3$, this is a non-trivial, infinite, non-abelian group.\n\nThe Rosenberg index $\\alpha(M)$ is an element of the group $K_{2m-1}(C^*_r(\\Gamma))$, which, by the given Bott periodicity, is isomorphic to $K_1(C^*_r(\\mathbb{Z}_p * \\mathbb{Z}_r))$. The structure of this K-theory group can be quite complex and is studied via tools like the Baum-Connes conjecture. Its non-triviality suggests that there is, in principle, room for a non-zero index invariant $\\alpha(M)$.\n\nHowever, our calculation in Task 3 demonstrates a profound principle: the geometry of the manifold severely constrains the possible values of this topological invariant. The existence of a metric with positive scalar curvature, regardless of the complexity of the fundamental group $\\Gamma$ and the target K-theory group $K_{2m-1}(C^*_r(\\Gamma))$, forces the twisted Dirac operator to be invertible. An invertible operator always has a trivial K-theory index.\n\nIn conclusion, although the fundamental group $\\Gamma \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_p * \\mathbb{Z}_r$ dictates the (potentially very complicated) algebraic structure of the target group for the index, the geometric condition of positive scalar curvature on $M$ ensures that the actual computed value of the index $\\alpha(M)$ is the zero element of that group. This result is a specific instance of the celebrated Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture (now a theorem in dimensions $n \\ge 5$), which states that a closed spin manifold admits a PSC metric if and only if its Rosenberg index vanishes. Our derivation provides a direct proof of the \"only if\" part for the manifold $M$.\n\nThe final value of the index is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3032115"}]}
