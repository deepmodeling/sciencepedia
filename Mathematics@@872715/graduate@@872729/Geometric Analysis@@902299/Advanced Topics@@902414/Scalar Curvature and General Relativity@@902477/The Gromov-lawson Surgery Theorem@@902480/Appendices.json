It is scientifically grounded in standard Riemannian geometry, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information and no contradictions. The problem can be solved using established principles of differential geometry.\n\nThe solution will proceed in three main steps. First, we will establish the scalar curvature of the standard $n$-sphere of radius $1$. Second, we will derive the transformation law for scalar curvature under a homothetic scaling of the metric. Third, we will apply this law to the standard sphere metric to find the scalar curvature for a sphere of general radius $r$.\n\nThe problem states that $S^n$ for $n \\ge 2$ is realized as the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, equipped with the metric $g_1$ induced by the standard Euclidean inner product. This manifold, $(S^n, g_1)$, is a classic example of a space form. It is a maximally symmetric space with constant positive sectional curvature. It is a well-established fact from the geometry of submanifolds that the sectional curvature of $S^n(1) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is constant and equal to $K=+1$.\n\nWe begin by computing the scalar curvature of $(S^n, g_1)$ from this fundamental property.\nLet $g_1$ denote the standard round metric on the unit sphere $S^n$. The sectional curvature $K_{g_1}$ for any $2$-plane $\\sigma$ in any tangent space $T_p S^n$ is constant, $K_{g_1}(\\sigma) = 1$.\n\nThe Ricci tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}$, is defined by its action on tangent vectors $X, Y \\in T_p S^n$. If we choose an orthonormal basis $\\{E_1, \\dots, E_n\\}$ for $T_p S^n$, the component $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(E_i, E_j)$ is given by\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(E_i, E_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^n R_{g_1}(E_k, E_i, E_k, E_j)\n$$\nwhere $R_{g_1}$ is the $(0,4)$-Riemann tensor. For a space of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Riemann tensor has a specific form:\n$$\nR_{g_1}(X,Y,Z,W) = K (g_1(X,W)g_1(Y,Z) - g_1(X,Z)g_1(Y,W))\n$$\nSetting $K=1$, we find the Ricci tensor components:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(E_i, E_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^n (g_1(E_k,E_j)g_1(E_i,E_k) - g_1(E_k,E_k)g_1(E_i,E_j))\n$$\nSince $\\{E_k\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, $g_1(E_a, E_b) = \\delta_{ab}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(E_i, E_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^n (\\delta_{kj}\\delta_{ik} - \\delta_{kk}\\delta_{ij}) = \\delta_{ij} - n \\delta_{ij} = (1-n)\\delta_{ij}\n$$\nThis calculation is slightly incorrect. Let's re-evaluate using the definition of Ricci curvature as a trace of the curvature operator. A more direct route is to relate Ricci curvature to sectional curvatures. For a unit vector $X \\in T_p S^n$, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(X,X)$ is the sum of sectional curvatures of all planes containing $X$. Let $\\{E_1, \\dots, E_n\\}$ be an orthonormal basis with $E_1=X$. Then\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(X,X) = \\sum_{j=2}^n K_{g_1}(\\mathrm{span}\\{E_1, E_j\\}) = \\sum_{j=2}^n 1 = n-1\n$$\nSince this holds for any unit vector $X$, the Ricci tensor must be proportional to the metric:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1} = (n-1)g_1\n$$\nThe scalar curvature, $S_{g_1}$, is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric $g_1$. Using our orthonormal basis $\\{E_i\\}$:\n$$\nS_{g_1} = \\mathrm{tr}_{g_1}(\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(E_i, E_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (n-1) = n(n-1)\n$$\nSince $n \\ge 2$, $S_{g_1} = n(n-1) > 0$. Thus, $(S^n, g_1)$ indeed has positive scalar curvature.\n\nNext, we derive the transformation law for scalar curvature under the homothetic scaling $g \\mapsto \\tilde{g} = c g$ for a constant $c>0$.\nLet $\\nabla$ and $\\tilde{\\nabla}$ be the Levi-Civita connections of $g$ and $\\tilde{g}$ respectively. The connection is determined by the Koszul formula. For any vector fields $X, Y, Z$:\n$$\n2 \\tilde{g}(\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y, Z) = X(\\tilde{g}(Y,Z)) + Y(\\tilde{g}(X,Z)) - Z(\\tilde{g}(X,Y)) + \\tilde{g}([X,Y],Z) - \\tilde{g}([X,Z],Y) - \\tilde{g}([Y,Z],X)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\tilde{g}=cg$ and using that $c$ is a constant:\n$$\n2c g(\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y, Z) = c \\left( X(g(Y,Z)) + Y(g(X,Z)) - Z(g(X,Y)) + g([X,Y],Z) - g([X,Z],Y) - g([Y,Z],X) \\right)\n$$\nThe expression in the parenthesis is $2g(\\nabla_X Y, Z)$. Therefore,\n$$\n2c g(\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y, Z) = 2c g(\\nabla_X Y, Z)\n$$\nwhich implies $\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y = \\nabla_X Y$ for all $X, Y$. The Levi-Civita connection is invariant under constant scaling of the metric.\n\nNow we examine the Riemann curvature tensor, which is defined in its $(1,3)$-form as $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$. Since the connection is invariant, the $(1,3)$-tensor is also invariant:\n$$\n\\tilde{R}(X,Y)Z = \\tilde{\\nabla}_X \\tilde{\\nabla}_Y Z - \\tilde{\\nabla}_Y \\tilde{\\nabla}_X Z - \\tilde{\\nabla}_{[X,Y]}Z = R(X,Y)Z\n$$\nThe Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}}$ is the trace of the curvature operator. Let $\\{E_i\\}$ be a $g$-orthonormal basis. Then $\\{\\tilde{E}_i = E_i / \\sqrt{c}\\}$ forms a $\\tilde{g}$-orthonormal basis. The Ricci tensor (as a bilinear form) is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}}(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\tilde{g}(\\tilde{R}(X, \\tilde{E}_i)Y, \\tilde{E}_i)\n$$\nUsing $\\tilde{R}=R$ and $\\tilde{g}=cg$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}}(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^n c g(R(X, E_i/\\sqrt{c})Y, E_i/\\sqrt{c}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n c \\frac{1}{c} g(R(X, E_i)Y, E_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(R(X, E_i)Y, E_i) = \\mathrm{Ric}_{g}(X,Y)\n$$\nThus, the Ricci tensor, as a $(0,2)$-tensor, is also invariant under constant metric scaling: $\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}} = \\mathrm{Ric}_{g}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the scalar curvature $S_{\\tilde{g}}$, which is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to its metric $\\tilde{g}$.\n$$\nS_{\\tilde{g}} = \\mathrm{tr}_{\\tilde{g}}(\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}}(\\tilde{E}_i, \\tilde{E}_i)\n$$\nUsing the invariance of the Ricci tensor and the definition of $\\tilde{E}_i$:\n$$\nS_{\\tilde{g}} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{Ric}_{g}(\\frac{E_i}{\\sqrt{c}}, \\frac{E_i}{\\sqrt{c}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{c} \\mathrm{Ric}_{g}(E_i, E_i) = \\frac{1}{c} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{Ric}_{g}(E_i, E_i)\n$$\nThe sum on the right is the scalar curvature $S_g$. So, we arrive at the scaling law:\n$$\nS_{\\tilde{g}} = \\frac{1}{c} S_g\n$$\nThe problem specifies the family of metrics $g_r = r^2 g_1$. This corresponds to the scaling factor $c=r^2$. Applying the derived law:\n$$\nS_{g_r} = \\frac{1}{r^2} S_{g_1}\n$$\nSubstituting the value $S_{g_1} = n(n-1)$:\n$$\nS_{g_r} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{r^2}\n$$\nFor any choice of $r>0$, since $n \\ge 2$, the scalar curvature $S_{g_r}$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the family $(S^n, g_r)$ for $r>0$ provides an explicit construction of metrics with positive scalar curvature on $S^n$.\n\nAs a brief contextual remark related to the Gromov-Lawson surgery theorem, this family of metrics is fundamental. When performing surgery on a manifold, one excises a region and glues in a new piece. The \"neck\" of this surgery region is topologically $S^{k} \\times S^{n-k-1} \\times [0,1]$. A key step in the proof of the surgery theorem is to show that if one starts with a positive scalar curvature (PSC) metric, the new manifold after surgery also admits a PSC metric (provided the surgery codimension is at least $3$). This is accomplished by carefully constructing a metric on the neck region modeled on a cylinder $S^{n-1} \\times I$. The metric on the cross-sectional sphere $S^{n-1}$ can be chosen from the family $(S^{n-1}, g_r)$. The positive scalar curvature of these spheres, $S_{g_r} = (n-1)(n-2)/r^2$, is essential. By making the radius $r$ of the neck very small, the contribution of the cross-sectional curvature becomes large and positive, which can be used to dominate any negative curvature contributions that might arise from gluing, ultimately allowing for the construction of a new, global PSC metric.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n(n-1)}{r^2}}$$", "id": "3035445"}, {"introduction": "The theory of positive scalar curvature would be limited if spheres were our only examples. A crucial step in enlarging our collection of PSC manifolds is to understand how geometric properties behave under standard constructions like the Riemannian product.

The entire analysis will be conducted from first principles.\n\nLet the two Riemannian manifolds be $(M_1, g_1)$ and $(M_2, g_2)$. The product manifold is $M = M_1 \\times M_2$ equipped with the product metric $g = g_1 \\oplus g_2$. At any point $(x,y) \\in M_1 \\times M_2$, the tangent space splits as $T_{(x,y)}M \\cong T_x M_1 \\oplus T_y M_2$. For vector fields $X, Y$ that are lifts of vector fields from $M_1$ and $Z, W$ that are lifts of vector fields from $M_2$, the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ of the product metric satisfies:\n$\\nabla_X Y$ is the lift of the corresponding covariant derivative on $M_1$.\n$\\nabla_Z W$ is the lift of the corresponding covariant derivative on $M_2$.\n$\\nabla_X Z = \\nabla_Z X = 0$.\nFrom this, it follows that the Riemann curvature tensor of the product manifold has no mixed terms. The non-zero components are those with all vectors belonging to either $T_x M_1$ or $T_y M_2$. Consequently, the Ricci tensor also splits. The scalar curvature $R(g)$ at a point $(x,y) \\in M_1 \\times M_2$ is the sum of the scalar curvatures of the component manifolds at $x$ and $y$:\n$$\nR_g(x,y) = R_{g_1}(x) + R_{g_2}(y)\n$$\nIn our case, the manifold is $M = S^p \\times S^q$, and the metric is $g_{a,b} = (a^2 g_{S^p}) \\oplus (b^2 g_{S^q})$. The component manifolds are $(S^p, a^2 g_{S^p})$ and $(S^q, b^2 g_{S^q})$. Let us denote $g_1 = a^2 g_{S^p}$ and $g_2 = b^2 g_{S^q}$. The total scalar curvature $R(g_{a,b})$ will be the sum of the scalar curvatures of the two component manifolds, $R(g_1)$ and $R(g_2)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the scalar curvature of a standard $n$-dimensional unit sphere, $(S^n, g_{S^n})$. A unit sphere embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is a space of constant sectional curvature $K=1$. For such a space, the Ricci tensor is given by $\\text{Ric} = (n-1)K g$. The scalar curvature $R$ is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric $g$. In an orthonormal basis, $R = \\text{tr}_g(\\text{Ric}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\text{Ric}(e_i, e_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (n-1)K g(e_i, e_i) = n(n-1)K$. For the unit sphere $S^n$, $K=1$, so its scalar curvature is a constant given by:\n$$\nR(g_{S^n}) = n(n-1)\n$$\nApplying this to our specific spheres, we have:\n$$\nR(g_{S^p}) = p(p-1)\n$$\n$$\nR(g_{S^q}) = q(q-1)\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine how the scalar curvature behaves under a constant scaling of the metric. Let $(M, g)$ be a Riemannian manifold and let $\\tilde{g} = c^2 g$ for a constant $c > 0$. The metric tensor and its inverse in local coordinates are related by $\\tilde{g}_{ij} = c^2 g_{ij}$ and $\\tilde{g}^{ij} = c^{-2} g^{ij}$. The Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection are given by:\n$$\n\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})\n$$\nFor the scaled metric $\\tilde{g}$, the Christoffel symbols are:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Gamma}^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{g}^{kl} (\\partial_i \\tilde{g}_{jl} + \\partial_j \\tilde{g}_{il} - \\partial_l \\tilde{g}_{ij}) = \\frac{1}{2} (c^{-2} g^{kl}) (c^2 \\partial_i g_{jl} + c^2 \\partial_j g_{il} - c^2 \\partial_l g_{ij}) = \\Gamma^k_{ij}\n$$\nThe Christoffel symbols are invariant under constant scaling. The components of the Ricci tensor are given by $R_{ij} = \\partial_k \\Gamma^k_{ij} - \\partial_j \\Gamma^k_{ik} + \\Gamma^k_{kl}\\Gamma^l_{ij} - \\Gamma^k_{jl}\\Gamma^l_{ik}$. Since the Christoffel symbols are invariant, the components of the Ricci tensor $\\text{Ric}_{ij}$ are also invariant under constant scaling, i.e., $\\widetilde{\\text{Ric}}_{ij} = \\text{Ric}_{ij}$.\nThe scalar curvature is the trace of the Ricci tensor:\n$$\nR(\\tilde{g}) = \\tilde{g}^{ij} \\widetilde{\\text{Ric}}_{ij} = (c^{-2} g^{ij}) (\\text{Ric}_{ij}) = c^{-2} (g^{ij} \\text{Ric}_{ij}) = c^{-2} R(g)\n$$\nSo, for a metric $\\tilde{g} = c^2 g$, the scalar curvature scales as $R(\\tilde{g}) = \\frac{1}{c^2} R(g)$.\n\nNow we can calculate the scalar curvatures of the component manifolds.\nFor the first component $(S^p, g_1)$ where $g_1 = a^2 g_{S^p}$, the scaling constant is $c=a$. The scalar curvature is:\n$$\nR(g_1) = R(a^2 g_{S^p}) = \\frac{1}{a^2} R(g_{S^p}) = \\frac{p(p-1)}{a^2}\n$$\nFor the second component $(S^q, g_2)$ where $g_2 = b^2 g_{S^q}$, the scaling constant is $c=b$. The scalar curvature is:\n$$\nR(g_2) = R(b^2 g_{S^q}) = \\frac{1}{b^2} R(g_{S^q}) = \\frac{q(q-1)}{b^2}\n$$\nSince the scalar curvature of the product manifold is the sum of the scalar curvatures of its components, we have:\n$$\nR(g_{a,b}) = R(g_1) + R(g_2) = \\frac{p(p-1)}{a^2} + \\frac{q(q-1)}{b^2}\n$$\nThis is the explicit analytic expression for the scalar curvature of the manifold $(S^p \\times S^q, g_{a,b})$.\n\nWe now use this expression to explain why this metric has positive scalar curvature (PSC). We are given $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, which implies $a^2 > 0$ and $b^2 > 0$. We are also given the condition $p \\ge 2$ and $q \\ge 2$.\nFor $p \\ge 2$, the term $p-1 \\ge 1$, so the product $p(p-1) \\ge 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$. Thus, $p(p-1) > 0$.\nFor $q \\ge 2$, the term $q-1 \\ge 1$, so the product $q(q-1) \\ge 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$. Thus, $q(q-1) > 0$.\nThe scalar curvature is a sum of two terms:\n$$\nR(g_{a,b}) = \\underbrace{\\frac{p(p-1)}{a^2}}_{>0} + \\underbrace{\\frac{q(q-1)}{b^2}}_{>0}\n$$\nEach term is the ratio of a strictly positive number to another strictly positive number, and is therefore strictly positive. The sum of two strictly positive numbers is strictly positive. Hence, $R(g_{a,b}) > 0$ for all $a, b > 0$ and for all integers $p, q \\ge 2$.\n\nThis result is fundamental in the context of the Gromov-Lawson surgery theorem. The theorem provides a method to construct new manifolds with positive scalar curvature from existing ones. A crucial starting point for this theory is the existence of a supply of manifolds that are known to admit PSC metrics. Spheres $S^n$ for $n \\ge 2$ are the archetypal examples. The calculation above demonstrates that the property of admitting a PSC metric is preserved under the operation of taking products, provided the component manifolds have dimensions at least $2$. The product $S^p \\times S^q$ (for $p,q \\ge 2$) is therefore a basic but important example of a simply connected manifold that is not a sphere but carries a PSC metric. The Gromov-Lawson theorem then implies that any manifold obtained by performing surgery in codimension $\\ge 3$ on $S^p \\times S^q$ will also admit a metric of positive scalar curvature. The condition $p, q \\ge 2$ is vital; if, for example, $p=1$, the manifold is $S^1 \\times S^q$, and the term $p(p-1)$ becomes $0$, leading to $R(g_{a,b}) = q(q-1)/b^2 \\ge 0$. If $q$ were also $1$, the result is the flat torus $S^1 \\times S^1$, which does not admit any PSC metric. The problem's constraints are thus perfectly aligned with the known theory of PSC metrics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{p(p-1)}{a^2} + \\frac{q(q-1)}{b^2}}$$", "id": "3035423"}, {"introduction": "The genius of the Gromov-Lawson surgery theorem lies in the explicit construction of a PSC metric on the resulting manifold.

In our orthonormal frame, this is the sum of the diagonal components:\n$R_g = \\mathrm{Ric}_g(\\partial_r, \\partial_r) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\mathrm{Ric}_g(E_i, E_i)$.\nSubstituting the expressions for the components:\n$R_g = -(n-1)\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\left( \\frac{n-2}{f(r)^2} - \\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} - (n-2)\\frac{(f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} \\right)$.\n$R_g = -(n-1)\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} + (n-1)\\left( \\frac{n-2}{f(r)^2} - \\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} - (n-2)\\frac{(f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} \\right)$.\n$R_g = -2(n-1)\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} + \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{f(r)^2} - \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{f(r)^2}(f'(r))^2$.\nUsing the given scalar curvature of the sphere $R_h = (n-1)(n-2)$, we obtain the formula:\n$R_g = -2(n-1)\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} - (n-1)(n-2)\\frac{(f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} + \\frac{R_h}{f(r)^2}$.\nThis derivation confirms the formula provided in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 2: Solving the Differential Equation**\n\nThe problem asks for a function $f(r)$ that yields a constant scalar curvature $R_g = c > 0$. Thus, we set the expression for $R_g$ equal to $c$:\n$-2(n-1)\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} - (n-1)(n-2)\\frac{(f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} + \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{f(r)^2} = c$.\n\nThis is a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation for $f(r)$. To solve it, we first rearrange the terms. Multiplying by $f(r)^2$ and dividing by $n-1$:\n$-2f(r)f''(r) - (n-2)(f'(r))^2 + (n-2) = \\frac{c}{n-1}f(r)^2$.\n$2f(r)f''(r) + (n-2)(f'(r))^2 = (n-2) - \\frac{c}{n-1}f(r)^2$.\n\nThis is an autonomous equation since $r$ does not appear explicitly. We use the standard substitution $p(f) = f'(r)$, which implies $f''(r) = \\frac{dp}{dr} = \\frac{dp}{df}\\frac{df}{dr} = p\\frac{dp}{df}$.\nSubstituting into the equation gives:\n$2fp\\frac{dp}{df} + (n-2)p^2 = (n-2) - \\frac{c}{n-1}f^2$.\nLet $u(f) = p^2 = (f')^2$. Then $\\frac{du}{df} = 2p\\frac{dp}{df}$. The equation becomes a first-order linear ODE for $u(f)$:\n$f\\frac{du}{df} + (n-2)u = (n-2) - \\frac{c}{n-1}f^2$.\nDividing by $f$:\n$\\frac{du}{df} + \\frac{n-2}{f}u = \\frac{n-2}{f} - \\frac{c}{n-1}f$.\n\nWe solve this using an integrating factor $I(f)$:\n$I(f) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{n-2}{f} df\\right) = \\exp((n-2)\\ln f) = f^{n-2}$.\nMultiplying the ODE by $I(f)$:\n$f^{n-2}\\frac{du}{df} + (n-2)f^{n-3}u = (n-2)f^{n-3} - \\frac{c}{n-1}f^{n-1}$.\nThe left side is the derivative of the product $I(f)u(f)$:\n$\\frac{d}{df}(f^{n-2}u) = (n-2)f^{n-3} - \\frac{c}{n-1}f^{n-1}$.\nIntegrating with respect to $f$ (valid for $n \\ge 3$):\n$f^{n-2}u = \\int \\left((n-2)f^{n-3} - \\frac{c}{n-1}f^{n-1}\\right) df = f^{n-2} - \\frac{c}{n(n-1)}f^n + C_1$, where $C_1$ is an integration constant.\nSolving for $u$:\n$u(f) = 1 - \\frac{c}{n(n-1)}f^2 + C_1 f^{-(n-2)}$.\n\nRecalling that $u = (f')^2$, we have:\n$(f'(r))^2 = 1 - \\frac{c}{n(n-1)}f(r)^2 + C_1 f(r)^{-(n-2)}$.\nWe use the initial conditions $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$ to determine $C_1$. As $r \\to 0$, we have $f(r) \\approx f'(0)r = r$.\nThe left side of the equation approaches $(f'(0))^2 = 1^2 = 1$. On the right side, the first two terms approach $1-0=1$. The term $C_1 f(r)^{-(n-2)}$ behaves like $C_1 r^{-(n-2)}$. Since $n \\ge 3$, the exponent $-(n-2)$ is less than or equal to $-1$. If $C_1 \\neq 0$, this term would diverge as $r \\to 0$. To maintain the equality, we must have $C_1 = 0$.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$(f'(r))^2 = 1 - \\frac{c}{n(n-1)}f(r)^2$.\nLet $k^2 = \\frac{c}{n(n-1)}$. Since $c>0$ and $n \\ge 3$, $k$ is a positive real constant: $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{n(n-1)}}$.\nThe ODE is $(f')^2 = 1 - k^2 f^2$.\nTaking the square root gives $f'(r) = \\pm\\sqrt{1 - k^2 f(r)^2}$. From the initial condition $f'(0)=1 > 0$, we must choose the positive root for $r$ near $0$. By continuity, we take the positive root for all $r \\in (0,L)$.\n$\\frac{df}{dr} = \\sqrt{1 - k^2 f^2}$.\nThis is a separable equation:\n$\\frac{df}{\\sqrt{1 - k^2 f^2}} = dr$.\nIntegrating both sides from $0$ to $r$:\n$\\int_0^{f(r)} \\frac{d\\tilde{f}}{\\sqrt{1 - k^2 \\tilde{f}^2}} = \\int_0^r d\\tilde{r}$.\nThe left integral is $\\left[\\frac{1}{k}\\arcsin(k\\tilde{f})\\right]_0^{f(r)} = \\frac{1}{k}\\arcsin(kf(r))$. The right integral is $r$.\n$\\frac{1}{k}\\arcsin(kf(r)) = r$.\nSolving for $f(r)$:\n$\\arcsin(kf(r)) = kr$\n$kf(r) = \\sin(kr)$\n$f(r) = \\frac{1}{k}\\sin(kr)$.\n\nSubstituting back the expression for $k$:\n$f(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{n(n-1)}{c}} \\sin\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{n(n-1)}} r\\right)$.\n\nThis is the closed-form solution for the warping function $f(r)$ that satisfies the given conditions. Let us verify the initial conditions:\n$f(0) = \\frac{1}{k}\\sin(0) = 0$.\n$f'(r) = \\frac{1}{k} \\cos(kr) \\cdot k = \\cos(kr)$, so $f'(0) = \\cos(0) = 1$.\nBoth conditions are satisfied.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{n(n-1)}{c}} \\sin\\left(r\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{n(n-1)}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3035418"}]}
