The equality holds if the second term is zero. This occurs if either $\\tanh(|x|^2)=0$ (which means $x=0$) or if $e(x) \\cdot \\xi = 0$. For any $x \\neq 0$, the vector $e(x)$ is non-zero. Since the dimension $n \\ge 2$, we can always choose a non-zero vector $\\xi$ that is orthogonal to $e(x)$ (and thus to $x$). For such a choice of $\\xi$, we have $e(x) \\cdot \\xi = 0$, which gives $p(x,\\xi) = |\\xi|^2$.\nThus, the minimum value of the ratio $\\frac{p(x,\\xi)}{|\\xi|^2}$ is exactly $1$.

Let's compute $|e(x)|^2$:\n$$\n|e(x)|^2 = \\left|\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+|x|^2}}\\right|^2 = \\frac{|x|^2}{1+|x|^2}\n$$\nTherefore, for all $x, \\xi$:\n$$\n\\frac{p(x,\\xi)}{|\\xi|^2} \\leq 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\tanh\\big(|x|^{2}\\big)\\,\\frac{|x|^2}{1+|x|^2}\n$$\nTo find the sharp constant $\\Lambda$, we must find the supremum of the right-hand side over all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.

We will address each part of the query in sequence: justification of harmonicity, explanation for the existence of a Taylor series, identification of the lowest-degree term, and computation of the vanishing order.\n\nTo simplify the analysis, we introduce a new coordinate system $y = (y_1, y_2, y_3)$ centered at $x_0$:\n$$ y_1 = x_1 - 1 $$\n$$ y_2 = x_2 - (-2) = x_2 + 2 $$\n$$ y_3 = x_3 - 3 $$\nIn terms of these new coordinates, the function $u$ takes a simpler form. Let us also define the complex variable $\\zeta = y_1 + i y_2$. The expression for $u$ becomes:\n$$ u(x) = u(x_0+y) = \\operatorname{Re}(\\zeta^3) + y_3 \\operatorname{Re}(\\zeta^2) + \\operatorname{Re}(\\zeta^5) $$\nWe will work with this expression of $u$ as a function of $y$. The Laplace operator $\\Delta = \\partial_{x_1}^2 + \\partial_{x_2}^2 + \\partial_{x_3}^2$ is invariant under translation, so in the $y$-coordinates, it is $\\Delta = \\partial_{y_1}^2 + \\partial_{y_2}^2 + \\partial_{y_3}^2$.\n\n**1. Justification that $u$ is harmonic on $\\mathbb{R}^3$**\n\nA function is harmonic if it satisfies the Laplace equation, $\\Delta u = 0$. We can analyze the function $u$ by decomposing it into three parts:\n$u_1(y) = \\operatorname{Re}(\\zeta^3)$, $u_2(y) = y_3 \\operatorname{Re}(\\zeta^2)$, and $u_3(y) = \\operatorname{Re}(\\zeta^5)$.\nSince the Laplacian is a linear operator, $\\Delta u = \\Delta u_1 + \\Delta u_2 + \\Delta u_3$. We check each term individually.\n\nFor $u_1(y) = \\operatorname{Re}(\\zeta^3)$ and $u_3(y) = \\operatorname{Re}(\\zeta^5)$: The functions $f_k(\\zeta) = \\zeta^k$ for $k=3, 5$ are analytic functions of the complex variable $\\zeta = y_1 + i y_2$. A fundamental property of analytic functions is that their real and imaginary parts are harmonic functions in their variables. Let $v(y_1, y_2) = \\operatorname{Re}(f_k(\\zeta))$. Then $v$ satisfies the two-dimensional Laplace equation $(\\partial_{y_1}^2 + \\partial_{y_2}^2)v = 0$. Since $u_1$ and $u_3$ do not depend on $y_3$, their second partial derivative with respect to $y_3$ is zero, i.e., $\\partial_{y_3}^2 u_k = 0$ for $k=1,3$. Therefore, $\\Delta u_1 = 0$ and $\\Delta u_3 = 0$.\n\nFor $u_2(y) = y_3 \\operatorname{Re}(\\zeta^2)$: First, we write $\\operatorname{Re}(\\zeta^2) = \\operatorname{Re}((y_1+iy_2)^2) = \\operatorname{Re}(y_1^2 + 2iy_1y_2 - y_2^2) = y_1^2 - y_2^2$.\nSo, $u_2(y) = y_3(y_1^2 - y_2^2)$. We compute its second partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial y_1} = 2y_1y_3 \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 u_2}{\\partial y_1^2} = 2y_3 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial y_2} = -2y_2y_3 \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 u_2}{\\partial y_2^2} = -2y_3 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial y_3} = y_1^2 - y_2^2 \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 u_2}{\\partial y_3^2} = 0 $$\nThe Laplacian of $u_2$ is the sum of these terms:\n$$ \\Delta u_2 = \\frac{\\partial^2 u_2}{\\partial y_1^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_2}{\\partial y_2^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_2}{\\partial y_3^2} = 2y_3 - 2y_3 + 0 = 0 $$\nThus, $u_2$ is also a harmonic function.\n\nSince $u$ is a sum of three harmonic functions ($u_1, u_2, u_3$), it is itself a harmonic function on all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**2. Explanation for the existence of a Taylor expansion**\n\nThe Laplace equation, $\\Delta u = 0$, is a second-order linear partial differential equation. The coefficients of the Laplace operator $\\Delta = \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\partial_{x_j}^2$ are all constant functions equal to $1$, which are real-analytic on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The Laplace equation is the canonical example of an elliptic PDE with analytic coefficients. A fundamental result of the theory of elliptic regularity states that any solution to an elliptic equation with analytic coefficients must be real-analytic.\nSince we have shown that $u$ is a solution to $\\Delta u = 0$ over the entire domain $\\mathbb{R}^3$, $u$ is a real-analytic function on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. By definition, a function that is real-analytic at a point $x_0$ can be represented by a convergent Taylor series in a neighborhood of $x_0$. Hence, $u$ admits a Taylor expansion at $x_0$.\n\n**3. Identification of the lowest-degree nonzero homogeneous harmonic polynomial and computation of the vanishing order**\n\nThe Taylor expansion of $u$ at $x_0$ is an expansion in powers of the components of $y = x - x_0$. As shown earlier, in these centered coordinates, $u$ is given by:\n$$ u(x_0+y) = \\operatorname{Re}((y_1+iy_2)^3) + y_3 \\operatorname{Re}((y_1+iy_2)^2) + \\operatorname{Re}((y_1+iy_2)^5) $$\nThis expression is a finite polynomial in the variables $y_1, y_2, y_3$. For a polynomial, its Taylor expansion about the origin is the polynomial itself. We can group the terms by their total degree in $y$.\nLet's expand each term:\n$$ \\operatorname{Re}((y_1+iy_2)^3) = y_1^3 - 3y_1y_2^2 $$\nThis is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $3$.\n$$ y_3 \\operatorname{Re}((y_1+iy_2)^2) = y_3(y_1^2 - y_2^2) $$\nThis is a product of a degree-$1$ polynomial ($y_3$) and a degree-$2$ polynomial ($y_1^2 - y_2^2$), resulting in a homogeneous polynomial of degree $3$.\n$$ \\operatorname{Re}((y_1+iy_2)^5) = y_1^5 - 10y_1^3y_2^2 + 5y_1y_2^4 $$\nThis is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $5$.\n\nThus, the expansion of $u$ around $x_0$ is a sum of homogeneous polynomials in $y = x - x_0$:\n$$ u(x) = H_3(x-x_0) + H_5(x-x_0) $$\nwhere\n$$ H_3(y) = (y_1^3 - 3y_1y_2^2) + y_3(y_1^2 - y_2^2) $$\n$$ H_5(y) = y_1^5 - 10y_1^3y_2^2 + 5y_1y_2^4 $$\nThe Taylor series for $u$ at $x_0$ has no terms of degree $0, 1, 2,$ or $4$. The first non-vanishing term is $H_3(x-x_0)$, which is of degree $3$.\n\nThe vanishing order of $u$ at $x_0$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $m$ such that the $m$-th order homogeneous term in the Taylor expansion of $u$ at $x_0$ is non-zero. From the expansion $u(x) = H_3(x-x_0) + H_5(x-x_0)$, the homogeneous terms are of degrees $3$ and $5$. The lowest degree of a non-zero term is $3$.\nThe problem notes correctly that the Taylor expansion of a harmonic function is a sum of homogeneous harmonic polynomials. We have shown that the components of $u$ are harmonic; therefore, $H_3(y)$ (as a sum of two harmonic polynomials) and $H_5(y)$ are themselves homogeneous harmonic polynomials.\n\nThe lowest-degree nonzero homogeneous harmonic polynomial in the Taylor expansion of $u$ at $x_0$ is $H_3(x-x_0)$, which is:\n$$ \\left((x_1-1)^3 - 3(x_1-1)(x_2+2)^2\\right) + (x_3-3)\\left((x_1-1)^2 - (x_2+2)^2\\right) $$\nThe degree of this polynomial is $3$. Consequently, the vanishing order of $u$ at $x_0$ is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3036931"}, {"introduction": "Modern proofs of unique continuation, such as those based on Carleman estimates, rely on deep connections between the operator and the geometry of the underlying phase space.

The Poisson bracket is defined by\n$$\n\\{a,b\\} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial \\xi_j} \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x_j} - \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial x_j} \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial \\xi_j} \\right).\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the required partial derivatives of $p$ and $\\varphi$.\nFor $p(x, \\xi) = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x_k} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}.\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\xi_k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi_k} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j^2 \\right) = 2\\xi_k \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}.\n$$\nIn vector notation, $\\partial_x p = \\vec{0}$ and $\\partial_{\\xi} p = 2\\xi$.\n\nFor $\\varphi(x, \\xi) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^n x_j^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial x_k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^n x_j^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(2x_k) = x_k \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}.\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial \\xi_k} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}.\n$$\nIn vector notation, $\\partial_x \\varphi = x$ and $\\partial_{\\xi} \\varphi = \\vec{0}$.\n\nNow we can compute the first Poisson bracket, which we denote by $q(x, \\xi) = \\{p, \\varphi\\}(x, \\xi)$:\n$$\nq(x, \\xi) = \\{p, \\varphi\\} = \\partial_{\\xi} p \\cdot \\partial_x \\varphi - \\partial_x p \\cdot \\partial_{\\xi} \\varphi\n$$\n$$\nq(x, \\xi) = (2\\xi) \\cdot (x) - (\\vec{0}) \\cdot (\\vec{0}) = 2(\\xi \\cdot x) = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j x_j.\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the double Poisson bracket $\\{p, q\\} = \\{p, \\{p, \\varphi\\}\\}$. We need the partial derivatives of $q(x, \\xi) = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j x_j$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x_k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} \\left( 2 \\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j x_j \\right) = 2\\xi_k \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}.\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial \\xi_k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi_k} \\left( 2 \\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j x_j \\right) = 2x_k \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}.\n$$\nIn vector notation, $\\partial_x q = 2\\xi$ and $\\partial_{\\xi} q = 2x$.\n\nNow we compute the second Poisson bracket, $\\{p, q\\}$:\n$$\n\\{p, q\\} = \\partial_{\\xi} p \\cdot \\partial_x q - \\partial_x p \\cdot \\partial_{\\xi} q\n$$\nSubstituting the derivatives we have found:\n$$\n\\{p, \\{p, \\varphi\\}\\}(x, \\xi) = (2\\xi) \\cdot (2\\xi) - (\\vec{0}) \\cdot (2x) = 4(\\xi \\cdot \\xi) - 0.\n$$\nTherefore, the result is:\n$$\n\\{p, \\{p, \\varphi\\}\\}(x, \\xi) = 4|\\xi|^2.\n$$\n\nThe problem also asks to use this computation to verify positivity. The result is $4|\\xi|^2$. For any vector $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, the squared Euclidean norm $|\\xi|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j^2$ is non-negative. It is strictly positive for any non-zero covector $\\xi \\neq \\vec{0}$. Thus, $\\{p, \\{p, \\varphi\\}\\} \\ge 0$. This strict positivity away from the zero section $\\xi=0$ establishes the strict pseudoconvexity condition required for the application of Hörmander's theorems on unique continuation.\n\nThe final task is to provide the closed-form analytic expression for the double bracket as a function of $\\xi$. Our result, $4|\\xi|^2$, is precisely this expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4|\\xi|^2}$$", "id": "3036932"}]}
