We will proceed to solve it by direct application of the provided definitions.\n\nThe complex manifold is a torus $X = \\mathbb{C}^{n} / \\Lambda$. The problem provides the flat Kähler form $\\omega_{0}$ on $X$, which is induced from the standard Hermitian metric on its universal cover $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. In the global linear holomorphic coordinates $z^{1},\\dots,z^{n}$ on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, this form is given by:\n$$\n\\omega_{0} = \\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} dz^{i} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{i}\n$$\nA general Kähler form $\\omega$ is expressed in local holomorphic coordinates in terms of the components of its associated Kähler metric tensor $g_{i\\bar{j}}$ as:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} g_{i\\bar{j}} dz^{i} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j}\n$$\nBy comparing the specific expression for $\\omega_{0}$ with the general one, we identify the components of its metric tensor. We can rewrite the sum for $\\omega_{0}$ using the Kronecker delta symbol, $\\delta_{ij}$, which is $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ otherwise:\n$$\n\\omega_{0} = \\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\delta_{ij} dz^{i} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j}\n$$\nThis comparison reveals that the components of the metric tensor for $\\omega_{0}$ are $g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\delta_{ij}$. The matrix of these coefficients, $(g_{i\\bar{j}})$, is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, $I_{n}$. As correctly stated in the problem, these coefficients are constant functions on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$.\n\nThe first task is to compute the Ricci form, $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0})$. The definition provided is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega) = - \\sqrt{-1} \\,\\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\log \\det(g_{i\\bar{j}})\n$$\nWe apply this formula to our metric $g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\delta_{ij}$.\nFirst, we compute the determinant of the metric tensor matrix:\n$$\n\\det(g_{i\\bar{j}}) = \\det(I_{n}) = 1\n$$\nNext, we take the logarithm of this determinant:\n$$\n\\log \\det(g_{i\\bar{j}}) = \\log(1) = 0\n$$\nThe result is the constant function $0$ on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Now, we apply the Dolbeault operators $\\partial$ and $\\bar{\\partial}$. For any constant function $c$, its derivatives are zero. Therefore:\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial} (\\log \\det(g_{i\\bar{j}})) = \\bar{\\partial}(0) = 0\n$$\nAnd subsequently:\n$$\n\\partial \\bar{\\partial} (\\log \\det(g_{i\\bar{j}})) = \\partial(0) = 0\n$$\nThe resulting $(2,2)$-form is the zero form. Substituting this into the definition of the Ricci form:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0}) = - \\sqrt{-1} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThe Ricci form of the flat Kähler metric on the torus is the zero $2$-form.\n\nThe calculation was performed in the global coordinates of $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Since the metric coefficients $g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\delta_{ij}$ are constant everywhere on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, the result $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0}) = 0$ is valid globally on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Both the metric form $\\omega_{0}$ and its Ricci form $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0})=0$ are invariant under translations $z \\mapsto z + \\lambda$ for $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$. Therefore, they descend to well-defined global forms on the quotient space $X = \\mathbb{C}^{n} / \\Lambda$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0})$ vanishes globally on the torus $X$. A Kähler manifold with a vanishing Ricci form is known as a Calabi-Yau manifold (or Ricci-flat Kähler manifold), and the flat torus is a fundamental example.\n\nThe second task is to justify that the solution to the unnormalized Kähler-Ricci flow, $\\partial_{t}\\omega(t) = - \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t))$, with initial data $\\omega(0) = \\omega_{0}$, is stationary.\nAt time $t=0$, the flow equation is:\n$$\n\\partial_{t}\\omega(t)|_{t=0} = - \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(0)) = - \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0})\n$$\nUsing our previously computed result, $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0}) = 0$, we find:\n$$\n\\partial_{t}\\omega(t)|_{t=0} = 0\n$$\nThis indicates that the initial \"velocity\" of the form is zero. Let us test the hypothesis that the solution is stationary, i.e., $\\omega(t) = \\omega_{0}$ for all time $t \\geq 0$.\nFor this proposed solution, the left-hand side of the flow equation is the time derivative of a constant form:\n$$\n\\partial_{t}\\omega(t) = \\partial_{t}(\\omega_{0}) = 0\n$$\nThe right-hand side of the flow equation for this solution is:\n$$\n- \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t)) = - \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0}) = 0\n$$\nSince both the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation equal zero, the proposed stationary solution $\\omega(t) = \\omega_{0}$ is a valid solution. By the short-time existence and uniqueness theorem for the Kähler-Ricci flow, this is the unique solution for the given initial condition.
