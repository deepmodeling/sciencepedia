A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe harmonic map heat flow is the $L^{2}$ gradient flow for the Dirichlet energy functional $E$. The flow equation is given by\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = - \\text{grad}_{L^2} E(\\psi)\n$$\nwhere $\\text{grad}_{L^2} E(\\psi)$ is the gradient of the energy functional $E$ with respect to the $L^{2}$ inner product.\n\nTo find the gradient, we compute the first variation of the energy $E(\\psi)$. Let $\\eta(\\theta)$ be a smooth, time-independent variation, and consider the family of maps $\\psi_s(\\theta) = \\psi(\\theta,t) + s\\eta(\\theta)$ for a small real parameter $s$. The Dirichlet energy of this varied map is\n$$\nE(\\psi_s) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\left|\\partial_{\\theta}(\\psi + s\\eta)\\right|^{2}\\,d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\left( (\\partial_{\\theta}\\psi) + s(\\partial_{\\theta}\\eta) \\right)^{2}\\,d\\theta\n$$\n$$\nE(\\psi_s) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\left( (\\partial_{\\theta}\\psi)^{2} + 2s(\\partial_{\\theta}\\psi)(\\partial_{\\theta}\\eta) + s^{2}(\\partial_{\\theta}\\eta)^{2} \\right)\\,d\\theta\n$$\nThe first variation is the derivative with respect to $s$ evaluated at $s=0$:\n$$\n\\delta E(\\psi)[\\eta] = \\left. \\frac{dE(\\psi_s)}{ds} \\right|_{s=0} = \\left. \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\left( (\\partial_{\\theta}\\psi)(\\partial_{\\theta}\\eta) + s(\\partial_{\\theta}\\eta)^{2} \\right)\\,d\\theta \\right|_{s=0} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}(\\partial_{\\theta}\\psi)(\\partial_{\\theta}\\eta)\\,d\\theta\n$$\nWe apply integration by parts to this expression. The term $\\int u dv = [uv] - \\int v du$ translates here to\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}(\\partial_{\\theta}\\psi)(\\partial_{\\theta}\\eta)\\,d\\theta = \\left[ (\\partial_{\\theta}\\psi)\\eta \\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} - \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}(\\partial_{\\theta}^{2}\\psi)\\eta\\,d\\theta\n$$\nSince $\\psi$ and $\\eta$ are functions on the circle $S^1$, they are periodic with period $2\\pi$. Thus, the boundary term vanishes: $\\left[ (\\partial_{\\theta}\\psi)\\eta \\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 0$. This leaves\n$$\n\\delta E(\\psi)[\\eta] = - \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}(\\partial_{\\theta}^{2}\\psi)\\eta\\,d\\theta\n$$\nBy definition, the first variation is also related to the gradient by the $L^{2}$ inner product:\n$$\n\\delta E(\\psi)[\\eta] = \\langle \\text{grad}_{L^2} E(\\psi), \\eta \\rangle_{L^2} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}(\\text{grad}_{L^2} E(\\psi))\\,\\eta\\,d\\theta\n$$\nComparing the two expressions for the first variation, we have\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}(\\text{grad}_{L^2} E(\\psi))\\,\\eta\\,d\\theta = - \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}(\\partial_{\\theta}^{2}\\psi)\\eta\\,d\\theta\n$$\nSince this equality must hold for all smooth variations $\\eta$, it follows from the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations that the integrands must be equal:\n$$\n\\text{grad}_{L^2} E(\\psi) = -\\partial_{\\theta}^{2}\\psi\n$$\nSubstituting this into the gradient flow equation gives the harmonic map heat flow PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = - (-\\partial_{\\theta}^{2}\\psi) = \\partial_{\\theta}^{2}\\psi\n$$\nThis is the standard one-dimensional heat equation for the function $\\psi(\\theta,t)$.\n\nNow, we restrict our attention to the specific family of maps given by\n$$\n\\psi(\\theta,t) = \\theta + \\phi(t)\n$$\nWe substitute this form into the heat flow equation $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial \\theta^2}$.\nFirst, we compute the left-hand side:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\theta + \\phi(t)) = \\frac{d\\phi}{dt}\n$$\nNext, we compute the right-hand side by taking derivatives with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(\\theta + \\phi(t)) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial \\theta^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(1) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the heat flow PDE yields the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $\\phi(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = 0\n$$\nWe must solve this ODE subject to the initial condition derived from $\\psi(\\theta,0)=\\theta+\\phi_{0}$. At $t=0$, our specific form for $\\psi$ gives\n$$\n\\psi(\\theta,0) = \\theta + \\phi(0)\n$$\nComparing this with the given initial condition, we find that\n$$\n\\phi(0) = \\phi_{0}\n$$\nIntegrating the ODE $\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = 0$ with respect to time $t$ gives\n$$\n\\phi(t) = C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. Applying the initial condition $\\phi(0) = \\phi_0$, we find $C = \\phi_0$.\nTherefore, the explicit solution for $\\phi(t)$ is\n$$\n\\phi(t) = \\phi_0\n$$\nThis result is expected. The initial map $\\psi(\\theta,0) = \\theta + \\phi_0$ is a rotation, which is an isometry and thus a harmonic map. Harmonic maps are, by definition, critical points of the Dirichlet energy, meaning the gradient of the energy at these maps is zero. Since the harmonic map heat flow evolves a map in the direction of the negative gradient, a map starting at a critical point will not evolve in time; it is a fixed point of the flow.

We begin by calculating the differential $du$ and its squared norm $|du|^2$.\nThe differential $du$ is a section of the bundle $T^*T^m \\otimes u^*(TT^n)$. In the standard local coordinates, its components are given by the partial derivatives of the map $u$:\n$$ (du)_i^\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial u^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i} $$\nFor the given affine map, we have:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^m A_{\\alpha j} x^j + b^\\alpha \\right) = A_{\\alpha i} $$\nThe components of the differential are the constant entries of the matrix $A$.\n\nThe pointwise Hilbert-Schmidt norm squared of the differential, $|du|^2$, is defined as the trace of the pullback of the target metric, which in local coordinates is given by:\n$$ |du|^2 = g^{ij} h_{\\alpha\\beta} \\frac{\\partial u^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial u^\\beta}{\\partial x^j} $$\nUsing the summation convention, we substitute the components of our metrics and differential:\n$$ |du|^2 = \\delta_{ij} \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} (A_{\\alpha i}) (A_{\\beta j}) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^n (A_{\\alpha i})^2 $$\nThis expression is the sum of the squares of all the entries of the matrix $A$. It is a constant value, independent of the point $x \\in T^m$. Let us denote this constant by $C = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^n (A_{\\alpha i})^2$.\n\nNext, we compute the action of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta_g$ on the function $|du|^2=C$.

The formula simplifies to the standard Euclidean Laplacian:\n$$ \\Delta_g f = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{(\\partial x^i)^2} $$\nWe apply this operator to the function $|du|^2 = C$. Since $C$ is a constant, its partial derivatives of any order are zero.\n$$ \\Delta_g(|du|^2) = \\Delta_g(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{(\\partial x^i)^2} = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}(0) = 0 $$\nThus, the first part of the problem yields the result $\\Delta_g(|du|^2) = 0$.\n\nSecond, we must justify from first principles why the curvature contribution from the target manifold $T^n$ vanishes in the Bochner identity. The Bochner identity for a harmonic map $u: (M,g) \\to (N,h)$ relates the Laplacian of the energy density to several terms, including one that depends on the Riemann curvature tensor of the target manifold, $R^N$. This term is typically of the form $-\\operatorname{tr}_g \\langle R^N(du(\\cdot), du(\\cdot))du(\\cdot), du(\\cdot) \\rangle_h$.

In the standard coordinate system $(y^1, \\dots, y^n)$, the components of the metric tensor are constant: $h_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$.\nConsequently, all partial derivatives of the metric components are zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial y^\\gamma} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} $$\nSubstituting this into the formula for the Christoffel symbols, we find that they are all identically zero:\n$$ \\Gamma^\\gamma_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2} h^{\\gamma\\delta} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0 $$\nNow, substituting $\\Gamma^\\gamma_{\\alpha\\beta} = 0$ into the formula for the Riemann curvature tensor, all terms vanish:\n$$ R^\\delta_{\\ \\alpha\\beta\\gamma} = 0 - 0 + 0 - 0 = 0 $$\nSince all components of the Riemann curvature tensor of the target manifold $(T^n, h)$ are zero, the tensor itself is identically zero ($R^N \\equiv 0$).

A key consequence of flatness is that the Christoffel symbols vanish in the standard Cartesian coordinates. Let $(x^1, x^2)$ be the coordinates on the universal cover $\\mathbb{R}^2$ of $M$, and let $F = (F^1, F^2, F^3)$ be the coordinate representation of a lift of $f$ to the universal covers, $F: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$.

This imposes quasi-periodicity conditions on its lift $F$. The fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, generated by loops corresponding to the basis vectors $e_1 = (1,0)$ and $e_2 = (0,1)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The homomorphism $\\rho: \\pi_1(M) \\to \\pi_1(N)$ maps these generators according to the matrix $A$.

Since $F$ must be harmonic, $\\Delta F = \\Delta L + \\Delta P = 0$. An affine map from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is of the form $L(x) = Bx + c$ for a matrix $B \\in \\mathrm{Mat}_{3\\times 2}(\\mathbb{R})$ and vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. Such a map is always harmonic as its second derivatives are zero, so $\\Delta L = 0$. This implies we must have $\\Delta P = 0$. Since $P$ is periodic, it descends to a map from the compact torus $M$ to $\\mathbb{R}^3$. By the maximum principle, a harmonic function on a compact manifold without boundary must be constant. Therefore, each component of $P$ must be constant, meaning $P(x)$ is a constant vector.\n\nThus, any harmonic lift $F$ must be an affine map:\n$$\nF(x^1, x^2) = B \\begin{pmatrix} x^1 \\\\ x^2 \\end{pmatrix} + c\n$$\nfor some $B \\in \\mathrm{Mat}_{3\\times 2}(\\mathbb{R})$ and $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nWe apply the quasi-periodicity conditions to this affine form. For $v = e_1 = (1,0)$:\n$$\nF(x+e_1) - F(x) = (B(x+e_1)+c) - (Bx+c) = Be_1\n$$\nThis must equal $Ae_1$. Similarly, for $v=e_2=(0,1)$, we find $Be_2=Ae_2$. Since this must hold for the basis vectors, we must have $B=A$.\n\nSo, any harmonic lift must be of the form:\n$$\nF_c(x) = A x + c = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x^1 \\\\ x^2 \\end{pmatrix} + c\n$$\nfor some constant vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nEach such lift $F_c$ projects to a harmonic map $f_c: M \\to N$. We now determine the space of such maps. Two different lifts, $F_{c_1}$ and $F_{c_2}$, project to the same map on the tori if and only if their values are congruent modulo the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n$$\nF_{c_1}(x) \\equiv F_{c_2}(x) \\pmod{\\mathbb{Z}^3} \\implies Ax + c_1 \\equiv Ax + c_2 \\pmod{\\mathbb{Z}^3}\n$$\nThis simplifies to $c_1 - c_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3$.\nTherefore, the set of distinct harmonic maps in the given homotopy class is parametrized by the choice of the constant vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ modulo the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^3$. This parameter space is precisely the target torus:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_A = \\{f_c: M \\to N\\} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3/\\mathbb{Z}^3 = N\n$$\nThe problem asks for the dimension $d$ of this set of harmonic maps. Since the set is diffeomorphic to the target manifold $N$, its dimension is the dimension of $N$. The manifold $N = \\mathbb{R}^3/\\mathbb{Z}^3$ is the $3$-dimensional torus.\n\nThus, the dimension of the set of harmonic maps is $3$.\n\nWe can also interpret this through the action of the target torus on a fixed harmonic map. Let $f_0$ be the harmonic map corresponding to $c=0$, with lift $F_0(x) = Ax$. Any other harmonic map $f_c$ in the same homotopy class is given by the lift $F_c(x) = Ax+c$. Projecting to the torus $N$, this corresponds to post-composition by a translation:\n$$\nf_c([x]) = [F_c(x)] = [Ax+c] = [Ax] + [c] = f_0([x]) + [c]\n$$\nwhere $[x] \\in M$ and $[c] \\in N$, and the addition is the group operation on the torus $N$. The group of translations on $N$ is isomorphic to $N$ itself, which is a compact Lie group of dimension $3$. The set of harmonic maps in the specified homotopy class is the orbit of $f_0$ under the action of this group of translations. This orbit is diffeomorphic to the group itself. Therefore, the dimension of the set of harmonic maps is $\\dim(N) = 3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "3034994"}]}
