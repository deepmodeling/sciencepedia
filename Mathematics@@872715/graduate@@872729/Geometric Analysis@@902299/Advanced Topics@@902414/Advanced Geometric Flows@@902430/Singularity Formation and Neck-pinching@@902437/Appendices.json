The initial sphere at time $t=0$ has radius $R(0) = R_{0}$.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the sphere and the isotropic nature of the mean curvature, the evolving hypersurface $M_{t}$ remains a sphere for all $t \\in [0, T)$. Let its radius at time $t$ be $R(t)$. We can place the center of the sphere at the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ without loss of generality.\n\nA point on the sphere at time $t$ is represented by a position vector $x(t)$. The length of this vector is the radius of the sphere: $|x(t)| = R(t)$. The outward unit normal vector $\\nu(t)$ at the point $x(t)$ is given by $\\nu(t) = \\frac{x(t)}{|x(t)|} = \\frac{x(t)}{R(t)}$.\n\nThe problem provides the evolution law for MCF:\n$$ \\partial_{t} x = -H \\nu $$\nWe are also given that the mean curvature $H$ of a sphere of radius $R(t)$ is:\n$$ H = \\frac{n}{R(t)} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $H$ and $\\nu$ into the MCF equation, we get:\n$$ \\partial_{t} x = -\\left(\\frac{n}{R(t)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{x}{R(t)}\\right) = -\\frac{n}{R(t)^{2}} x $$\nNow, consider the time derivative of the position vector $x(t)$ from another perspective. The direction of a point on the shrinking sphere remains constant, so we can write $x(t) = R(t) \\hat{u}$, where $\\hat{u}$ is a constant unit vector. Differentiating with respect to time $t$ gives:\n$$ \\partial_{t} x = \\frac{d}{dt}(R(t) \\hat{u}) = \\frac{dR}{dt} \\hat{u} $$\nSince $\\hat{u} = \\frac{x(t)}{R(t)}$, we can write:\n$$ \\partial_{t} x = \\left(\\frac{dR}{dt}\\right) \\frac{x}{R(t)} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\partial_{t} x$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{dR}{dt}\\right) \\frac{x}{R(t)} = -\\frac{n}{R(t)^{2}} x $$\nFor any point $x \\neq 0$ on the sphere, we can cancel the vector $x$ and one factor of $R(t)^{-1}$ from both sides, which yields an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the radius $R(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = -\\frac{n}{R} $$\nThis is a separable ODE. We can rewrite it as:\n$$ R \\, dR = -n \\, dt $$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial time $t=0$ to a general time $t$.

The first interpretation would imply that the position vector $X$ is always normal to the surface, a condition met only by spheres centered at the origin. The second interpretation allows for a tangential component to the velocity, corresponding to a reparameterization of the surface, and correctly accommodates non-spherical solutions like planes and cylinders. In the context of geometric analysis, this latter interpretation is standard. Given that the problem explicitly asks to classify planes and cylinders, it is clear that the standard interpretation $(\\partial_{t}X)^{\\perp}=-H\\nu$ is intended.

The problem is self-contained and internally consistent, guiding the solver through a logical sequence of steps.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** under the standard interpretation of the Mean Curvature Flow equation. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Self-Shrinker Equation\n\nLet $X(p, t)$ be the position vector of a point $p \\in \\Sigma$ at time $t$. The self-similar ansatz is given as $X(p, t) = \\sqrt{-t} \\, X(p, -1)$ for $t \\in (-\\infty, 0)$. Let $X_0(p) = X(p, -1)$ be the embedding of the initial hypersurface $\\Sigma = \\Sigma_{-1}$. Then $X(p, t) = \\sqrt{-t} \\, X_0(p)$.\n\nThe velocity vector of a point on the evolving hypersurface is the partial derivative with respect to time:\n$$\n\\partial_t X(p, t) = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\sqrt{-t}) X_0(p) = -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{-t}} X_0(p)\n$$\nWe can express $X_0(p)$ in terms of $X(p, t)$ as $X_0(p) = \\frac{X(p, t)}{\\sqrt{-t}}$. Substituting this back gives the velocity vector at time $t$:\n$$\n\\partial_t X(p, t) = -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{-t}} \\left( \\frac{X(p, t)}{\\sqrt{-t}} \\right) = \\frac{X(p, t)}{2t}\n$$\nThe Mean Curvature Flow equation specifies the normal component of this velocity: $(\\partial_t X)^{\\perp} = -H\\nu$. The vector $X(p,t)$ can be decomposed into its tangential and normal components, $X = X^{\\top} + X^{\\perp}$. The normal component of the velocity is:\n$$\n(\\partial_t X)^{\\perp} = \\left(\\frac{X}{2t}\\right)^{\\perp} = \\frac{1}{2t} X^{\\perp}\n$$\nThe normal component of the position vector is given by $X^{\\perp} = \\langle X, \\nu \\rangle \\nu$. Thus,\n$$\n(\\partial_t X)^{\\perp} = \\frac{\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle}{2t} \\nu\n$$\nEquating this with the MCF equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle}{2t} \\nu = -H\\nu\n$$\nThis implies a relationship between the mean curvature $H$, the position vector $X$, and the normal $\\nu$:\n$$\nH = -\\frac{\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle}{2t}\n$$\nThis equation must hold for any self-shrinking solution at any time $t  0$. To obtain the static equation for the hypersurface $\\Sigma = \\Sigma_{-1}$, we evaluate this at $t=-1$:\n$$\nH = -\\frac{\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle}{2(-1)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle\n$$\nThis is the self-shrinker equation that the hypersurface $\\Sigma$ must satisfy.\n\n### Classification of Homogeneous Self-Shrinkers\n\nThe problem states that any complete, embedded, homogeneous hypersurface in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is a plane, a round sphere, or a generalized cylinder. We analyze each case using the self-shrinker equation $H = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle$. We adopt the convention where principal curvatures of a convex surface are positive with respect to the outward-pointing normal.\n\n**Case 1: Plane $\\mathbb{R}^n$**\nA plane in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ can be described by the equation $\\langle X, a \\rangle = c$, where $a$ is a constant unit vector and $c$ is a constant. We can choose the normal vector $\\nu = a$. The principal curvatures of a plane are all zero, $\\kappa_i = 0$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$. Consequently, the mean curvature is $H = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\kappa_i = 0$.\nThe self-shrinker equation becomes:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle X, a \\rangle = \\frac{c}{2}\n$$\nThis implies $c=0$. Therefore, the plane must pass through the origin. Any hyperplane through the origin is a trivial self-shrinker. The principal curvatures are all $0$.\n\n**Case 2: Round Sphere $S^n(r)$**\nLet us consider a sphere of radius $r  0$ centered at the origin. The position vector $X$ of any point on the sphere satisfies $|X|=r$. We choose the outward unit normal $\\nu = X/r$. The $n$ principal curvatures of a sphere of radius $r$ are all equal, $\\kappa_i = 1/r$. The mean curvature is the sum of these:\n$$\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{n}{r}\n$$\nThe term $\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle$ in the self-shrinker equation is:\n$$\n\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle = \\left\\langle X, \\frac{X}{r} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{|X|^2}{r} = \\frac{r^2}{r} = r\n$$\nSubstituting these into the self-shrinker equation $H = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\frac{n}{r} = \\frac{1}{2} r \\implies r^2 = 2n \\implies r = \\sqrt{2n}\n$$\nThus, a sphere centered at the origin is a self-shrinker if and only if its radius is $r = \\sqrt{2n}$. The principal curvatures are all equal to $\\kappa_i = 1/r = 1/\\sqrt{2n}$.\n\n**Case 3: Generalized Cylinder $S^k(r) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n-k}$**\nWe consider a generalized cylinder for $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. We can orient the coordinate system such that the cylinder is the set of points $X=(x_1, \\dots, x_{k+1}, y_1, \\dots, y_{n-k}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ where the first $k+1$ coordinates describe a sphere $S^k(r)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$, and the last $n-k$ coordinates are free. The axis of the cylinder, the $\\mathbb{R}^{n-k}$ factor, must pass through the origin for $\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle$ to be constant.\nA point $X$ on the cylinder can be written as $X=(x_p, y_p)$ where $x_p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ with $|x_p|=r$ and $y_p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n-k}$. The outward unit normal vector is $\\nu = (x_p/r, 0)$, where $0$ is the zero vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{n-k}$.\n\nThe principal curvatures are:\n- $k$ curvatures corresponding to the directions tangent to the $S^k$ factor, which are all $\\kappa_i = 1/r$.\n- $n-k$ curvatures corresponding to the directions along the $\\mathbb{R}^{n-k}$ factor, which are all $\\kappa_i = 0$.\n\nThe mean curvature is the sum:\n$$\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{r} + \\sum_{i=k+1}^n 0 = \\frac{k}{r}\n$$\nThe term $\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle$ is:\n$$\n\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle = \\langle (x_p, y_p), (x_p/r, 0) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{r} \\langle x_p, x_p \\rangle + \\langle y_p, 0 \\rangle = \\frac{|x_p|^2}{r} = \\frac{r^2}{r} = r\n$$\nSubstituting into the self-shrinker equation $H = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle X, \\nu \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\frac{k}{r} = \\frac{1}{2} r \\implies r^2 = 2k \\implies r = \\sqrt{2k}\n$$\nA generalized cylinder $S^k(r) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n-k}$ is a self-shrinker if its axis passes through the origin and its radius is $r = \\sqrt{2k}$. The principal curvatures are $k$ values of $1/\\sqrt{2k}$ and $n-k$ values of $0$.\n\n### Conclusion for the Final Answer\n\nThe problem asks for the common nonzero principal curvature, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{cyl}}(k)$, of the generalized cylinder $S^{k}(r)\\times \\mathbb{R}^{n-k}$ when it satisfies the self-shrinker equation.\nThe nonzero principal curvatures are all equal to $1/r$.

To find the governing equation for $a(t)$, we evaluate the PDE at $z=0$. The problem states that the neck at $z=0$ is a point of symmetry, which implies that the tangent to the generating curve is horizontal at the neck for all times $t$ before the pinch. Mathematically, this means $r_{z}(0,t) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $z=0$ and $r_z(0,t)=0$ into the evolution PDE, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{d a(t)}{d t} = \\frac{r_{zz}(0,t)}{1 + 0^{2}} - \\frac{1}{r(0,t)}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d a}{d t} = r_{zz}(0,t) - \\frac{1}{a(t)}\n$$\nThis is an exact equation, but it is not yet a closed ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $a(t)$ because of the term $r_{zz}(0,t)$, which describes the axial curvature of the neck.\n\nHere, we apply the slender-neck assumption. We are given a length scale $L$ such that at $t=0$, $r_{zz}(0,0) \\sim L^{-1}$ and $r_0 \\ll L$. This implies that the initial meridional curvature at the neck, $r_{zz}(0,0)$, is much smaller in magnitude than the initial azimuthal curvature, $1/r(0,0)=1/r_0$, since $L^{-1} \\ll r_{0}^{-1}$.\nIt is a standard result in the analysis of MCF that for such a slender neck, the neck profile evolves much more slowly than the neck radius contracts. As $a(t)$ decreases, the azimuthal curvature term $-1/a(t)$ grows and becomes even more dominant over the meridional curvature term $r_{zz}(0,t)$, which is assumed to remain bounded. Therefore, to leading order, the evolution of the neck is governed by the azimuthal curvature alone. This is equivalent to modeling the neck locally as a shrinking cylinder.\n\nThe leading-order ODE for $a(t)$ is thus obtained by neglecting the $r_{zz}(0,t)$ term:\n$$\n\\frac{d a}{d t} = -\\frac{1}{a}\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ODE. We can solve it subject to the initial condition $a(0) = r_0$.\n$$\na \\frac{d a}{d t} = -1 \\implies a \\, da = -dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state $(t=0, a=r_0)$ to a later state $(t, a(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{r_0}^{a(t)} a' \\, da' = \\int_{0}^{t} -1 \\, d\\tau'\n$$\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (a')^{2} \\right]_{r_0}^{a(t)} = \\left[ -\\tau' \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} a(t)^{2} - \\frac{1}{2} r_{0}^{2} = -t\n$$\nSolving for $a(t)^{2}$:\n$$\na(t)^{2} = r_{0}^{2} - 2t\n$$\nThe radius is a positive quantity, so we take the positive square root:\n$$\na(t) = \\sqrt{r_{0}^{2} - 2t}\n$$\nThe neck-pinch occurs at a finite time $t_{\\mathrm{pinch}}$ when the radius vanishes, i.e., $a(t_{\\mathrm{pinch}}) = 0$.\nSetting $a(t_{\\mathrm{pinch}}) = 0$ in the solution:\n$$\n0 = \\sqrt{r_{0}^{2} - 2 t_{\\mathrm{pinch}}}\n$$\n$$\nr_{0}^{2} - 2 t_{\\mathrm{pinch}} = 0\n$$\n$$\n2 t_{\\mathrm{pinch}} = r_{0}^{2}\n$$\nThis yields the expression for the pinching time:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{pinch}} = \\frac{r_{0}^{2}}{2}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{r_{0}^{2}}{2}}$$", "id": "3033520"}]}
