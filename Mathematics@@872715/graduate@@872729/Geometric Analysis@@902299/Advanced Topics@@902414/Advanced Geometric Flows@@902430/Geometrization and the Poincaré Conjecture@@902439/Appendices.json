It is a well-posed mathematical derivation task, firmly grounded in the established principles of Riemannian geometry and the theory of Ricci flow. The language is objective and formal, and all necessary components for the derivation are either provided or are standard theorems that can be invoked under the label \"general first-variation formula\". We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is to derive the evolution equations for two geometric quantities: the scalar curvature $R$ and the Riemannian volume form $d\\mu$. We will derive each in turn, starting only from the ingredients specified in the problem statement. The manifold is a closed, oriented $3$-manifold denoted by $M^3$, and the family of metrics is $\\{g(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,T)}$ evolving by the Ricci flow $\\partial_t g = -2\\operatorname{Ric}$. All tensorial objects are functions of time $t$, though this dependence is often suppressed for notational clarity.\n\nFirst, we derive the evolution of the volume form $d\\mu$.\nThe volume form is defined in local coordinates $(x^1, x^2, x^3)$ by $d\\mu = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$. Since the coordinate system is fixed, the evolution of $d\\mu$ is determined by the evolution of the scalar factor $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}$. We use the chain rule to compute its time derivative:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}} \\partial_{t}(\\det(g_{ij}))\n$$\nThe problem specifies to use the Jacobi formula for the derivative of a determinant. For a time-dependent invertible matrix $A(t)$, this formula states $\\partial_t(\\det A) = (\\det A) \\operatorname{tr}(A^{-1} \\partial_t A)$. Applying this to the metric tensor $g= (g_{ij})$, with its inverse $g^{-1} = (g^{ij})$, we have:\n$$\n\\partial_{t}(\\det(g_{ij})) = (\\det(g_{ij})) \\operatorname{tr}(g^{-1} \\partial_{t}g_{ij}) = (\\det(g_{ij})) g^{kl} (\\partial_{t}g_{kl})\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $\\partial_t \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}} \\left( (\\det(g_{ij})) g^{kl} (\\partial_{t}g_{kl}) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} (g^{kl} \\partial_{t}g_{kl})\n$$\nNow we introduce the Ricci flow equation, $\\partial_t g_{ij} = -2\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}$.\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} (g^{kl}(-2\\operatorname{Ric}_{kl})) = -\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} (g^{kl}\\operatorname{Ric}_{kl})\n$$\nThe expression $g^{kl}\\operatorname{Ric}_{kl}$ is the definition of the scalar curvature $R$. Thus,\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = -R \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}\n$$\nThis directly gives the evolution of the volume form $d\\mu$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} d\\mu = \\left(\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}\\right) dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 = (-R\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}) dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 = -R \\, d\\mu\n$$\nThe right-hand side of the evolution equation for $d\\mu$ is therefore $-R\\,d\\mu$.\n\nNext, we derive the evolution of the scalar curvature $R$.\nThe problem allows the use of the general first-variation formula for $R$ under a metric variation $v_{ij} = \\partial_t g_{ij}$. The standard form of this formula, consistent with the specified sign convention for the Laplacian $\\Delta = g^{ij}\\nabla_i\\nabla_j$, is:\n$$\n\\partial_t R = -\\Delta(\\operatorname{tr}_{g}v) + \\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{div} v) - \\langle v, \\operatorname{Ric} \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{tr}_g v = g^{ij}v_{ij}$, $\\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{div} v) = \\nabla^i\\nabla^j v_{ij}$, and $\\langle v, \\operatorname{Ric} \\rangle = v_{ij}\\operatorname{Ric}^{ij}$. For the Ricci flow, we substitute $v_{ij} = -2\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}$ and evaluate each term.\n\n1.  The trace term: The trace of the variation $v$ is\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{tr}_g v = g^{ij}v_{ij} = g^{ij}(-2\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}) = -2(g^{ij}\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}) = -2R\n    $$\n    The first term in the evolution equation is therefore $-\\Delta(\\operatorname{tr}_g v) = -\\Delta(-2R) = 2\\Delta R$.\n\n2.  The divergence term: The double divergence of $v$ is\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{div} v) = \\nabla^i \\nabla^j v_{ij} = \\nabla^i \\nabla^j (-2\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}) = -2\\nabla^i(\\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij})\n    $$\n    We apply the contracted second Bianchi identity, given as $\\nabla^i \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_j R$. By relabeling indices, we have $\\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{ji} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_i R$. Since the Ricci tensor is symmetric ($\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = \\operatorname{Ric}_{ji}$), this becomes $\\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_i R$. Substituting this into our expression:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{div} v) = -2\\nabla^i\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_i R\\right) = -\\nabla^i\\nabla_i R\n    $$\n    By raising the second index, $\\nabla^i\\nabla_i R = g^{ij}\\nabla_j\\nabla_i R$. Since covariant derivatives commute when acting on a scalar function ($R$), $\\nabla_j\\nabla_i R = \\nabla_i\\nabla_j R$. Therefore,\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{div} v) = -g^{ij}\\nabla_i\\nabla_j R = -\\Delta R\n    $$\n\n3.  The inner product term: The inner product of $v$ with the Ricci tensor is\n    $$\n    \\langle v, \\operatorname{Ric} \\rangle = v_{ij}\\operatorname{Ric}^{ij} = (-2\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij})\\operatorname{Ric}^{ij} = -2|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2\n    $$\n    where $|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2 = \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}\\operatorname{Ric}^{ij}$ is the squared norm of the Ricci tensor. The third term in the evolution equation is $-\\langle v, \\operatorname{Ric} \\rangle = -(-2|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2) = 2|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2$.\n\nFinally, we sum the three contributions to find the evolution equation for $R$:\n$$\n\\partial_t R = (2\\Delta R) + (-\\Delta R) + (2|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2) = \\Delta R + 2|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2\n$$\nThe right-hand side of the evolution equation for $R$ is $\\Delta R + 2|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2$. This derivation holds in any dimension, and no further simplification based on the specific dimension $n=3$ is required by the problem statement, as the result is already in terms of fundamental geometric quantities.\n\nThe final answer requires the right-hand sides of the two derived evolution equations to be presented as entries in a single row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta R + 2|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2  -R \\, d\\mu \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2997867"}, {"introduction": "With the fundamental evolution equations in hand, we can now study the behavior of Ricci flow in a concrete setting.

First, we compute the left-hand side (LHS), which is the time derivative of the metric tensor:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\partial_{t} \\left( r(t)^{2}\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}} \\right)\n$$\nSince $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ is independent of time, the derivative acts only on the scalar function $r(t)^{2}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\left( \\frac{d}{dt}r(t)^{2} \\right) g_{\\mathrm{can}} = \\left( 2\\,r(t)\\,\\frac{dr}{dt} \\right) g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\nLet us denote $\\frac{dr}{dt}$ by $r'(t)$. The LHS is then:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = 2\\,r(t)\\,r'(t)\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the right-hand side (RHS) of the Ricci flow equation. The problem provides the formula for the Ricci tensor of a round $3$-sphere with metric $g$ and radius $r$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g) = \\frac{2}{r^{2}}\\,g\n$$\nIn our case, the metric at time $t$ is $g(t)$ and the radius is $r(t)$. Therefore, the Ricci tensor at time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\frac{2}{r(t)^{2}}\\,g(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $g(t) = r(t)^{2}\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ into this formula, we get:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\frac{2}{r(t)^{2}}\\,(r(t)^{2}\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = 2\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\nNow, the RHS of the Ricci flow equation is $-2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))$:\n$$\n-2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = -2\\,(2\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = -4\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\n\nEquating the LHS and RHS, we have:\n$$\n2\\,r(t)\\,r'(t)\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}} = -4\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\nSince $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ is a non-degenerate metric tensor, we can equate the scalar coefficients on both sides:\n$$\n2\\,r(t)\\,r'(t) = -4\n$$\nThis simplifies to the following ordinary differential equation for the radius $r(t)$:\n$$\nr(t)\\,\\frac{dr}{dt} = -2\n$$\n\nThis is a separable first-order ODE. We can write it as:\n$$\nr\\,dr = -2\\,dt\n$$\nTo find the solution $r(t)$, we integrate both sides. We integrate from the initial time $t=0$ to an arbitrary time $t$, and correspondingly from the initial radius $r(0)=r_{0}$ to the radius $r(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{r_{0}}^{r(t)} r'\\,dr' = \\int_{0}^{t} -2\\,d\\tau\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(r')^{2} \\right]_{r_{0}}^{r(t)} = \\left[ -2\\,\\tau \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}r(t)^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}r_{0}^{2} = -2\\,t\n$$\nNow, we solve for $r(t)^{2}$:\n$$\nr(t)^{2} = r_{0}^{2} - 4\\,t\n$$\nSince the radius $r(t)$ must be positive, we take the positive square root:\n$$\nr(t) = \\sqrt{r_{0}^{2} - 4\\,t}\n$$\nThis expression describes the radius of the sphere as it evolves under Ricci flow.\n\nThe extinction time $T$ is the finite time at which the manifold shrinks to a point, meaning its radius becomes zero. We find $T$ by setting $r(T)=0$:\n$$\n0 = \\sqrt{r_{0}^{2} - 4\\,T}\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$\n0 = r_{0}^{2} - 4\\,T\n$$\nSolving for $T$, we obtain:\n$$\n4\\,T = r_{0}^{2}\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{r_{0}^{2}}{4}\n$$\nThis is the finite time at which the sphere collapses to a point under the Ricci flow.
