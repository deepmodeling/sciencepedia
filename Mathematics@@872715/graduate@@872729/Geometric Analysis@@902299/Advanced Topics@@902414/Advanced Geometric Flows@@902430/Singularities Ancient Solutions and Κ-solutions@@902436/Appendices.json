This requires understanding how the Ricci tensor behaves under a constant scaling of the metric. Let $\\tilde{g} = c\\,g$ where $c$ is a positive constant. We need to relate $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\tilde{g})$ to $\\operatorname{Ric}(g)$. In local coordinates, the components of the metric tensors are related by $\\tilde{g}_{ij} = c\\,g_{ij}$, and the components of their inverses are related by $\\tilde{g}^{ij} = c^{-1}g^{ij}$. The Christoffel symbols of the connection are given by\n$$ \\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ij}^{k} = \\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{g}^{kl}\\left(\\partial_{i}\\tilde{g}_{jl} + \\partial_{j}\\tilde{g}_{il} - \\partial_{l}\\tilde{g}_{ij}\\right) $$\nSince $c$ is a constant, its partial derivatives are zero.

The components of the Riemann curvature tensor of type $(1,3)$ are defined in terms of the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives:\n$$ \\tilde{R}_{ijk}^{l} = \\partial_{j}\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ik}^{l} - \\partial_{i}\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{jk}^{l} + \\tilde{\\Gamma}_{jp}^{l}\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ik}^{p} - \\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ip}^{l}\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{jk}^{p} $$\nSince $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ij}^{k} = \\Gamma_{ij}^{k}$, it follows immediately that the components are also invariant: $\\tilde{R}_{ijk}^{l} = R_{ijk}^{l}$.\nThe Ricci tensor components are obtained by contracting the Riemann tensor: $\\tilde{R}_{ik} = \\tilde{R}_{ijk}^{j}$. As the Riemann tensor components are invariant, so are the Ricci tensor components:\n$$ \\tilde{R}_{ik} = R_{ijk}^{j} = R_{ik} $$\nThis means that in any coordinate system, the components of $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\tilde{g})$ are identical to the components of $\\operatorname{Ric}(g)$. This implies that the tensor fields themselves are equal: $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\tilde{g}) = \\operatorname{Ric}(g)$.\n\nApplying this result to our problem, for any fixed time $t$, the scalar factor $\\rho(t)$ is a constant with respect to spatial variables. Thus, we have the relation:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\operatorname{Ric}\\left(\\rho(t)\\,g_{0}\\right) = \\operatorname{Ric}(g_{0}) $$\nNow we can write the RHS of the Ricci flow equation as:\n$$ \\text{RHS} = -2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = -2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g_{0}) $$\nThe problem states that the initial metric $g_0$ is Einstein with a positive Einstein constant $\\lambda > 0$, meaning it satisfies the condition $\\operatorname{Ric}(g_{0}) = \\lambda g_{0}$. Substituting this into the RHS gives:\n$$ \\text{RHS} = -2\\,\\left(\\lambda g_{0}\\right) = (-2\\lambda) g_{0} $$\nNow we equate the LHS and RHS:\n$$ \\left(\\partial_{t}\\rho(t)\\right)g_{0} = (-2\\lambda) g_{0} $$\nSince $g_{0}$ is a metric, it is a non-degenerate tensor field. Therefore, we can equate the scalar coefficients, which yields the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $\\rho(t)$:\n$$ \\partial_{t}\\rho(t) = -2\\lambda $$\nTo solve this ODE, we need an initial condition for $\\rho(t)$. From the problem statement, $g(0) = g_{0}$. From the ansatz, $g(0) = \\rho(0)g_{0}$. Comparing these two, we find $\\rho(0)g_{0} = g_{0}$, which implies $\\rho(0)=1$.\n\nWe now solve the initial value problem:\n$$ \\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = -2\\lambda, \\quad \\rho(0)=1 $$\nIntegrating the ODE with respect to $t$ gives:\n$$ \\rho(t) = \\int (-2\\lambda) dt = -2\\lambda t + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Using the initial condition $\\rho(0)=1$:\n$$ \\rho(0) = -2\\lambda(0) + C = 1 \\implies C=1 $$\nSo, the solution for the scale factor is:\n$$ \\rho(t) = 1 - 2\\lambda t $$\nThe singular (extinction) time $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is the time at which the metric becomes singular. For the ansatz $g(t) = \\rho(t)g_{0}$, this corresponds to the time when the scaling factor $\\rho(t)$ becomes zero, causing the manifold to collapse homothetically to a point (i.e., its volume vanishes). We find $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ by setting $\\rho(T_{\\mathrm{ext}}) = 0$:\n$$ 1 - 2\\lambda T_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 0 $$\nSolving for $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, we get:\n$$ 2\\lambda T_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 1 $$\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} $$\nSince we are given that $\\lambda > 0$, the extinction time $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is a positive and finite value, which is characteristic for Ricci flow on manifolds with positive Ricci curvature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2\\lambda}}$$", "id": "3033472"}, {"introduction": "Having observed the dynamic collapse of a sphere, we now investigate its underlying geometric structure.

To determine the nature of $f$ and the value of $C$, we can take the trace of this tensor equation with respect to the metric $g$.\n\nThe trace of the Hessian, $\\mathrm{tr}_{g}(\\nabla^{2}f)$, is the Laplacian of $f$, which we denote by $\\Delta f$.

The result we have just derived, $\\mu(ag, a\\tau) = \\mu(g, \\tau)$ for any $a0$, provides the justification. This equation demonstrates that the $\\mu$-entropy is invariant under parabolic scaling.\n\nThis invariance has a powerful consequence. For any geometric state defined by a pair $(g, \\tau)$ with $\\tau0$, we can find a corresponding state at the canonical time $\\tau'=1$ that has the same $\\mu$-entropy. Specifically, by choosing the scaling factor $a = 1/\\tau$, we have:\n$$\n\\mu(g, \\tau) = \\mu\\left(a^{-1} g, a^{-1} \\tau\\right) = \\mu\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau}g, 1\\right).\n$$\nThis identity shows that the entropy of a manifold $(M,g)$ at time-scale $\\tau$ is equal to the entropy of the rescaled manifold $(M, g/\\tau)$ at the fixed time-scale $\\tau=1$.\n\nThis property is fundamental in the analysis of singularities of the Ricci flow. Tangent flows, which model the geometry near a singularity, are obtained by a blow-up procedure, which consists of a sequence of parabolic rescalings. The limiting objects of these blow-ups are often self-similar solutions, such as shrinking Ricci solitons. These special solutions, known as ancient solutions or $\\kappa$-solutions, are the universal models for singularity formation.\n\nBy normalizing to $\\tau=1$, we effectively factor out the scaling degree of freedom from the problem. Instead of studying the behavior of $\\mu(g(\\tau), \\tau)$ for a Ricci flow solution $g(\\tau)$, one can equivalently study the entropy functional $\\mu(\\cdot, 1)$ evaluated on the family of normalized metrics $\\tilde{g}(\\tau) = g(\\tau)/\\tau$. For a self-similar solution, this normalized family $\\tilde{g}(\\tau)$ evolves in a much simpler way (e.g., it is stationary for a soliton, up to diffeomorphisms). Thus, fixing $\\tau=1$ is a natural choice that simplifies the analysis by focusing on the intrinsic, scale-invariant geometric properties of the flow, which is precisely what is needed to classify singularities and understand their structure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3033486"}]}
