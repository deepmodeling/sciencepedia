This local resemblance is formalized through the concept of charts. A chart on a manifold $M$ is a pair $(U, \\phi)$, where $U$ is an open subset of $M$ and $\\phi: U \\to V$ is a homeomorphism from $U$ to an open subset $V$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. A collection of charts that covers the entire manifold, i.e., $\\bigcup_i U_i = M$, is called an atlas.\n\nConsider the 2-torus, $T^2$, which can be visualized as the surface of a doughnut. Topologically, it is defined as the product space $S^1 \\times S^1$, where $S^1$ is the unit circle. It is a well-known result that the 2-torus is a smooth 2-manifold but that a single chart is insufficient to form a complete atlas for it.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct and most fundamental reason for this fact?\n\nA. The 2-torus is a compact topological space. Any chart must map it homeomorphically to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. However, a non-empty open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ cannot be compact, and a homeomorphism must preserve the property of compactness. This leads to a contradiction.\n\nB. The 2-torus is not simply connected, meaning it has \"holes\". Any chart must map to an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, all of which are simply connected. A homeomorphism must preserve simple-connectedness, so a non-simply connected space cannot be mapped to a simply connected one.\n\nC. The 2-torus is an orientable surface. A single chart would define a global orientation, but for a surface with non-trivial topology like the torus, a global orientation can only be consistently defined by checking the compatibility of at least two overlapping charts.\n\nD. The standard flat metric on the 2-torus gives it zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. Any chart covering the whole torus would have to be an isometry to an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (which is also flat). However, no such global isometry exists because the torus is a finite-volume space while any open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ has infinite volume.\n\nE. The 2-torus is a manifold without a boundary. A chart would map the entire torus to an open set $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$.

Analyze the following statements and determine which one is correct.\n\nA. $M$ is a smooth 1-dimensional submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ because it is the graph of a continuous function, $f(x)=|x|$.\n\nB. An atlas can be constructed for $M$ using two charts, $(\\mathcal{U}_1, \\phi_1)$ and $(\\mathcal{U}_2, \\phi_2)$, where $\\mathcal{U}_1 = \\{(x,x) \\in M \\mid x>0\\}$ with $\\phi_1(x,x)=x$ and $\\mathcal{U}_2 = \\{(x,-x) \\in M \\mid x<0\\}$ with $\\phi_2(x,-x)=x$. As $\\mathcal{U}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{U}_2$ is empty, the transition map condition is vacuously satisfied, thus making $M$ a smooth manifold.\n\nC. The map $\\psi: \\mathbb{R} \\to M$ defined by $\\psi(t) = (t^3, |t^3|)$ can serve as the inverse of a smooth chart map, $\\psi = \\phi^{-1}$, valid for a neighborhood of the origin $p_0$, thereby providing a smooth chart structure around $p_0$.\n\nD. For any chart $(\\mathcal{U}, \\phi)$ where $p_0 \\in \\mathcal{U}$ and $\\phi(p_0) = 0$, the corresponding local parameterization $g(t) = (i \\circ \\phi^{-1})(t)$ (where $i: M \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ is the inclusion map) must have a zero derivative vector, $g'(0) = (0,0)$.", "solution": "We consider the subset $M=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:y=|x|\\}$ and the point $p_{0}=(0,0)$.

Being the graph of a continuous function is not sufficient for being a smooth submanifold. At $x=0$, the function $f(x)=|x|$ is not differentiable, so $M$ does not arise as the graph of a $C^{1}$ function near $p_{0}$, and the embedded submanifold criterion fails at $p_{0}$. Hence A is false.\n\nAnalyze statement B. The proposed charts $\\mathcal{U}_{1}=\\{(x,x)\\in M:x>0\\}$ and $\\mathcal{U}_{2}=\\{(x,-x)\\in M:x<0\\}$ do not cover $p_{0}$, so they do not form an atlas for $M$. An atlas must cover all of $M$. Moreover, any attempt to add a chart at $p_{0}$ must satisfy regularity, which will fail as shown below. Hence B is false.\n\nAnalyze statement C. The map $\\psi(t)=(t^{3},|t^{3}|)$ is a continuous bijection $\\mathbb{R}\\to M$ with continuous inverse $\\phi(x,|x|)=\\sqrt[3]{x}$, so topologically it gives a chart.

Compute the derivative at $0$:\n- The first component $t^{3}$ has derivative $0$ at $0$.\n- For the second component, write $u(t)=t^{3}$; then $u'(0)=0$. A standard fact is that if $u$ is differentiable at $0$ with $u(0)=0$, then the derivative at $0$ of $|u(t)|$ exists only if $u'(0)=0$, and in that case it equals $0$. Therefore $\\frac{d}{dt}|t^{3}|\\big|_{t=0}=0$.\nThus $\\psi'(0)=(0,0)$, violating regularity. Hence C is false.\n\nAnalyze statement D.

Then $g$ is smooth (hence differentiable) and a homeomorphism onto $\\mathcal{U}$. Consider the $x$-coordinate $h(t)=\\pi_{x}(g(t))$, where $\\pi_{x}(x,y)=x$. Because $(x,|x|)\\mapsto x$ is a homeomorphism from any neighborhood of $p_{0}$ in $M$ to an open interval $J\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ containing $0$, and $g$ is a homeomorphism $I\\to\\mathcal{U}$, it follows that $h:I\\to J$ is a homeomorphism with $h(0)=0$. Since $g$ is differentiable, so is $h$, and we set $a=h'(0)$.\n\nWrite $g(t)=(h(t),k(t))$ with $k(t)=|h(t)|$ because $g(I)\\subset M$. Since $g$ is differentiable at $0$, both $h$ and $k$ must be differentiable at $0$. We now show that this forces $a=0$ and hence $g'(0)=(0,0)$.\n\nLet $h(t)=a t+r(t)$ with $\\lim_{t\\to 0}\\frac{r(t)}{t}=0$. Then\n$$\n\\frac{k(t)-k(0)}{t}=\\frac{|h(t)|}{t}=\\frac{|a t+r(t)|}{t}.\n$$\nFor $t\\to 0^{+}$,\n$$\n\\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{|h(t)|}{t}=\\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}}\\left|a+\\frac{r(t)}{t}\\right|=|a|.\n$$\nFor $t\\to 0^{-}$,\n$$\n\\lim_{t\\to 0^{-}}\\frac{|h(t)|}{t}=\\lim_{t\\to 0^{-}}-\\left|a+\\frac{r(t)}{t}\\right|=-|a|.\n$$\nThus the two-sided derivative $k'(0)$ exists if and only if $|a|=0$, i.e., $a=0$, and then $k'(0)=0$. Therefore $h'(0)=0$ and $k'(0)=0$, which implies\n$$\ng'(0)=(h'(0),k'(0))=(0,0).\n$$\nThis shows that for any chart around $p_{0}$, the induced local parameterization has zero derivative at $0$, violating the regularity requirement for an embedded smooth $1$-submanifold.
