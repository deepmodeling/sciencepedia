The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we establish the transformation law for the components of a $(2,0)$-tensor field under a change of coordinates. Let $T$ be a $(2,0)$-tensor. In a coordinate system $(x^a)$, it can be expressed as $T = \\sum_{a,b} T^{ab} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^a} \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^b}$. In another coordinate system $(u^i)$, it is $T = \\sum_{i,j} T'^{ij} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^i} \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^j}$. The basis vectors themselves transform according to the chain rule as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^a} = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^i}$. Substituting this into the first expression for $T$:\n$$T = \\sum_{a,b} T^{ab} \\left(\\sum_i \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^i}\\right) \\otimes \\left(\\sum_j \\frac{\\partial u^j}{\\partial x^b} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^j}\\right) = \\sum_{i,j} \\left(\\sum_{a,b} T^{ab} \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^a} \\frac{\\partial u^j}{\\partial x^b}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^i} \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^j}$$\nBy comparing coefficients, we derive the transformation law for the contravariant components:\n$$T'^{ij} = \\sum_{a,b=1}^2 T^{ab} \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^a} \\frac{\\partial u^j}{\\partial x^b}$$\nIn matrix notation, this is $T' = A T A^T$, where $(A)^i{}_a = \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^a}$ is the Jacobian matrix of the transformation.\n\nNext, we compute the necessary quantities at the point $p=(x,y)=(1,1)=(x^1,x^2)$. The coordinate transformation is given by $u^1=u=x^2+y$ and $u^2=v=x+y^2$. The Jacobian matrix $A$ of the transformation $\\Phi$ has components $A^i{}_a = \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^a}$:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u^1}{\\partial x^1} & \\frac{\\partial u^1}{\\partial x^2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u^2}{\\partial x^1} & \\frac{\\partial u^2}{\\partial x^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2y \\end{pmatrix}$$\nEvaluating at $p=(1,1)$:\n$$A_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(1) & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe components of the tensor field $T$ in the $(x,y)$ coordinates at $p$ are:\n$T^{11}(1,1) = 1+1=2$\n$T^{12}(1,1) = (1)(1)=1$\n$T^{21}(1,1) = 1^2=1$\n$T^{22}(1,1) = 1^2=1$\nIn matrix form, the components at $p$ are represented by the matrix $T_p$:\n$$T_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe now apply the transformation law $T'_p = A_p T_p A_p^T$ to find the components $T'^{ij}$ in the $(u,v)$ coordinates at $p$:\n$$T'_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$T'_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(2)+1(1) & 2(1)+1(1) \\\\ 1(2)+2(1) & 1(1)+2(1) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$T'_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 5(2)+3(1) & 5(1)+3(2) \\\\ 4(2)+3(1) & 4(1)+3(2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 13 & 11 \\\\ 11 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThus, the correctly transformed components are $T'^{11}=13$, $T'^{12}=11$, $T'^{21}=11$, and $T'^{22}=10$.\n\nThe final task is to calculate the squared Frobenius norm of the violation term, $\\|P'-T'\\|_{F}^{2}$. The violation is defined by $P'^{ij}-T'^{ij}=\\delta^{ij}(\\det A)^{2}$.\nFirst, we compute the determinant of the Jacobian matrix $A_p$:\n$$\\det A_p = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (1)(1) = 3$$\nThe square of the determinant is $(\\det A_p)^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\nThe components of the violation tensor $P'^{ij}-T'^{ij}$ are:\n$P'^{11} - T'^{11} = \\delta^{11} (9) = 1 \\cdot 9 = 9$\n$P'^{12} - T'^{12} = \\delta^{12} (9) = 0 \\cdot 9 = 0$\n$P'^{21} - T'^{21} = \\delta^{21} (9) = 0 \\cdot 9 = 0$\n$P'^{22} - T'^{22} = \\delta^{22} (9) = 1 \\cdot 9 = 9$\nThe squared Frobenius norm of this violation is the sum of the squares of its components:\n$$\\|P'-T'\\|_{F}^{2} = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{2} (P'^{ij}-T'^{ij})^2 = (9)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 + (9)^2$$\n$$\\|P'-T'\\|_{F}^{2} = 81 + 0 + 0 + 81 = 162$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{162}\n$$", "id": "3034075"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding what tensors are, it is crucial to master the algebraic operations that combine them.

We can find the component expression for $\\beta$. Let $X = X^{l} \\partial_{l}$ be a vector field.\nFirst, we apply the tensor field $A$ to $X$:\n$$\nA(X) = (A^{i}{}_{j} \\partial_{i} \\otimes dx^{j})(X^{l} \\partial_{l}) = A^{i}{}_{j} X^{l} (\\partial_{i} \\otimes dx^{j})(\\partial_{l}) = A^{i}{}_{j} X^{l} \\partial_{i} dx^{j}(\\partial_{l})\n$$\nUsing the property that $dx^{j}(\\partial_{l}) = \\delta^{j}_{l}$, where $\\delta^{j}_{l}$ is the Kronecker delta, we have:\n$$\nA(X) = A^{i}{}_{j} X^{l} \\partial_{i} \\delta^{j}_{l} = A^{i}{}_{j} X^{j} \\partial_{i}.\n$$\nThe resulting vector field, let's call it $Y = A(X)$, has components $Y^{i} = A^{i}{}_{j} X^{j}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the $1$-form $\\omega$ on this vector field $Y$:\n$$\n\\beta(X) = \\omega(A(X)) = \\omega(Y) = (\\omega_{k} dx^{k})(Y^{i} \\partial_{i}) = \\omega_{k} Y^{i} dx^{k}(\\partial_{i})\n$$\nUsing $dx^{k}(\\partial_{i}) = \\delta^{k}_{i}$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\beta(X) = \\omega_{k} Y^{i} \\delta^{k}_{i} = \\omega_{i} Y^{i} = \\omega_{i} (A^{i}{}_{j} X^{j}).\n$$\nIf we write $\\beta$ in its component form, $\\beta = \\beta_{j} dx^{j}$, its action on $X$ is $\\beta(X) = (\\beta_{j} dx^{j})(X^{l} \\partial_{l}) = \\beta_{j} X^{l} \\delta^{j}_{l} = \\beta_{j} X^{j}$.\nComparing the two expressions for $\\beta(X)$, we have $\\beta_{j} X^{j} = (\\omega_{i} A^{i}{}_{j}) X^{j}$.

In matrix notation, the row vector of components of $\\beta$ is the product of the row vector of components of $\\omega$ and the matrix of components of $A$.\n\n### Part 2: Smoothness of $\\beta$\n\nA tensor field is smooth if its component functions are smooth in a smooth coordinate system. We are using the standard Cartesian coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, which constitute a smooth chart.\nThe components of the tensor field $A$, $A^{i}{}_{j}(x,y,z)$, are given as:\n$A^{1}{}_{1}=x^{2}$, $A^{1}{}_{2}=yz$, $A^{1}{}_{3}=\\sin(x)$, $A^{2}{}_{1}=\\exp(y)$, $A^{2}{}_{2}=xz$, $A^{2}{}_{3}=y^{2}$, $A^{3}{}_{1}=z$, $A^{3}{}_{2}=\\cos(xy)$, $A^{3}{}_{3}=x+y+z$.\nAll of these are elementary functions (polynomials, trigonometric, exponential) which are infinitely differentiable ($C^{\\infty}$ or smooth) on their entire domain, $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\nThe components of the $1$-form $\\omega$, $\\omega_{k}(x,y,z)$, are given as:\n$\\omega_{1}=xy$, $\\omega_{2}=\\cos(z)$, $\\omega_{3}=x-yz$.\nThese are also polynomial and trigonometric functions, and thus are smooth on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nThe components of $\\beta$ are given by $\\beta_{j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\omega_{i} A^{i}{}_{j}$. For example,\n$$\n\\beta_{1} = \\omega_{1} A^{1}{}_{1} + \\omega_{2} A^{2}{}_{1} + \\omega_{3} A^{3}{}_{1} = (xy)(x^{2}) + (\\cos(z))(\\exp(y)) + (x-yz)(z).\n$$\nThe set of smooth functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is closed under addition and multiplication. Since each $\\beta_{j}$ is constructed by summing products of the component functions of $\\omega$ and $A$, which are all smooth, each component $\\beta_{j}$ is also a smooth function on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Therefore, the covector field $\\beta$ is a smooth covector field.\n\n### Part 3: Computation of $\\beta_{p}(v)$\n\nWe need to compute the value of $\\beta_{p}(v)$ at the point $p=(0,0,0)$ for the vector $v = 2\\,\\partial_{x}\\big|_{p} - 1\\,\\partial_{y}\\big|_{p} + 3\\,\\partial_{z}\\big|_{p}$.\nIn components, $p$ corresponds to $(x,y,z) = (0,0,0)$, and the vector $v$ has components $(v^1, v^2, v^3) = (2, -1, 3)$.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the components of the tensor $A$ and the covector $\\omega$ at the point $p=(0,0,0)$.\nFor $A_{p}$:\n$A^{1}{}_{1}(p) = 0^{2} = 0$\n$A^{1}{}_{2}(p) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n$A^{1}{}_{3}(p) = \\sin(0) = 0$\n$A^{2}{}_{1}(p) = \\exp(0) = 1$\n$A^{2}{}_{2}(p) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n$A^{2}{}_{3}(p) = 0^{2} = 0$\n$A^{3}{}_{1}(p) = 0$\n$A^{3}{}_{2}(p) = \\cos(0 \\cdot 0) = 1$\n$A^{3}{}_{3}(p) = 0+0+0 = 0$\n\nThe matrix of components for $A_{p}$ is:\n$$\n[A^{i}{}_{j}(p)] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFor $\\omega_{p}$:\n$\\omega_{1}(p) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n$\\omega_{2}(p) = \\cos(0) = 1$\n$\\omega_{3}(p) = 0 - 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n\nThe components of $\\omega_{p}$ are $(\\omega_{1}(p), \\omega_{2}(p), \\omega_{3}(p)) = (0, 1, 0)$.\n\nNow we compute $\\beta_{p}(v) = \\omega_{p}(A_{p}(v))$.

The non-zero inverse metric components are $g^{\\theta\\theta}=1$ and $g^{\\phi\\phi} = (\\sin^2(\\theta))^{-1}$.\nThe only non-zero partial derivative of a metric component with respect to the coordinates is $\\partial_{\\theta} g_{\\phi\\phi} = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$.\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n$$ \\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\phi\\phi} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\theta l}(-\\partial_l g_{\\phi\\phi}) = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{\\theta\\theta}(\\partial_{\\theta}g_{\\phi\\phi}) = -\\frac{1}{2}(1)(2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)) = -\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) $$\n$$ \\Gamma^{\\phi}_{\\theta\\phi} = \\Gamma^{\\phi}_{\\phi\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\phi l}(\\partial_l g_{\\theta\\phi} + \\partial_\\theta g_{\\phi l} - \\partial_\\phi g_{\\theta l}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\phi\\phi} \\partial_{\\theta} g_{\\phi\\phi} = \\frac{1}{2\\sin^2(\\theta)}(2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)) = \\frac{\\cos(\\theta)}{\\sin(\\theta)} = \\cot(\\theta) $$\nAll other Christoffel symbols are zero.\n\nNext, we compute the components of the covariant derivative of $X$, $\\nabla_k X^i = \\partial_k X^i + \\Gamma^i_{kl}X^l$. Since the components of $X$ are constant ($X^{\\theta}=0, X^{\\phi}=1$), their partial derivatives are zero, so $\\nabla_k X^i = \\Gamma^i_{kl}X^l = \\Gamma^i_{k\\phi}X^{\\phi} = \\Gamma^i_{k\\phi}$.\nWe specifically need $\\nabla_{\\phi}X^{\\theta}$:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\phi}X^{\\theta} = \\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\phi\\phi} = -\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) $$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $(\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi}$:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\nabla_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} - (T^{\\phi}{}_{\\phi} - T^{\\theta}{}_{\\theta})(-\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)) $$\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\nabla_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} + T^{\\phi}{}_{\\phi}\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) - T^{\\theta}{}_{\\theta}\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) $$\n\nNow, we compute the component $\\nabla_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi}$. The formula for the covariant derivative of a $(1,1)$-tensor is $\\nabla_k T^{i}{}_{j} = \\partial_k T^{i}{}_{j} + \\Gamma^{i}_{kl}T^{l}{}_{j} - \\Gamma^{l}_{kj}T^{i}{}_{l}$.\nFor $\\nabla_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi}$, we have $i=\\theta, j=\\phi, k=\\phi$:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\partial_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} + \\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\phi l} T^{l}{}_{\\phi} - \\Gamma^{l}_{\\phi\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{l} $$\nExpanding the sums over $l \\in \\{\\theta, \\phi\\}$:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\partial_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} + (\\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\phi\\theta}T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} + \\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\phi\\phi}T^{\\phi}{}_{\\phi}) - (\\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\phi\\phi}T^{\\theta}{}_{\\theta} + \\Gamma^{\\phi}_{\\phi\\phi}T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi}) $$\nSubstituting the values of the Christoffel symbols ($\\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\phi\\theta}=0, \\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\phi\\phi}=-\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta), \\Gamma^{\\phi}_{\\phi\\phi}=0$):\n$$ \\nabla_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\partial_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} + (0 - \\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)T^{\\phi}{}_{\\phi}) - (-\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)T^{\\theta}{}_{\\theta} + 0) $$\n$$ \\nabla_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\partial_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} - T^{\\phi}{}_{\\phi}\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) + T^{\\theta}{}_{\\theta}\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) $$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $\\nabla_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi}$ back into our equation for $(\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi}$:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\left( \\partial_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} - T^{\\phi}{}_{\\phi}\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) + T^{\\theta}{}_{\\theta}\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) \\right) + T^{\\phi}{}_{\\phi}\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) - T^{\\theta}{}_{\\theta}\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) $$\nAll terms involving the Christoffel symbols and tensor components cancel out, leaving:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\partial_{\\phi} T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} $$\nThis result demonstrates that for a coordinate vector field whose components are constant in that coordinate system (as is the case for $X=\\partial_\\phi$), the Lie derivative acts simply by partial differentiation on the tensor components.\n\nThe problem provides the component $T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)$. We perform the partial differentiation with respect to $\\phi$:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi} \\left( \\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi) \\right) $$\nSince $\\sin(\\theta)$ is treated as a constant with respect to $\\phi$:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\sin(\\theta) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}(\\sin(\\phi)) = \\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi) $$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi)}\n$$", "id": "3034082"}]}
