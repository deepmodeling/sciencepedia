Both are smooth functions on $\\Omega$. Their weak partial derivatives are equal to their classical partial derivatives:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x_1} = 1, \\quad \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x_2} = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_1} = 1, \\quad \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_2} = 0\n    $$\n    These derivatives are constant functions, which are integrable over any bounded set $\\Omega$.

The weak gradient of $u$, denoted by the matrix $\\nabla u$, is given almost everywhere by the classical Jacobian matrix:\n    $$\n    \\nabla u(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Analyze the function $\\phi(z) = \\|z\\|_{\\infty}$:**\n    The function $\\phi(z) = \\max\\{|z_1|, |z_2|\\}$ is the supremum norm on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. It is a convex and Lipschitz continuous function with a Lipschitz constant of $1$. By Rademacher's theorem, $\\phi$ is differentiable almost everywhere in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The points of non-differentiability occur precisely where the `max` is not uniquely attained or the absolute value is non-differentiable. This occurs on the set $S = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : |z_1|=|z_2|\\}$. This set $S$ is the union of two lines, $z_1 = z_2$ and $z_1 = -z_2$, and has Lebesgue measure zero in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    The classical derivative (gradient) $D\\phi(z)$ where it exists is:\n    $$\n    D\\phi(z) = \\begin{cases} (\\mathrm{sgn}(z_1), 0)  \\text{if } |z_1|  |z_2| \\\\ (0, \\mathrm{sgn}(z_2))  \\text{if } |z_2|  |z_1| \\end{cases}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Analyze the composition $w(x) = (\\phi \\circ u)(x)$:**\n    Substituting $u(x)=(x_1, x_1)$ into $\\phi$, we get:\n    $$\n    w(x) = \\phi(x_1, x_1) = \\max\\{|x_1|, |x_1|\\} = |x_1|\n    $$\n    The function $w(x)$ is a function on $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$.

Its weak gradient is given a.e. by:\n    $$\n    \\nabla w(x) = \\nabla(|x_1|) = (\\mathrm{sgn}(x_1), 0)\n    $$\n    This is the left-hand side of the chain rule we want to evaluate: $\\nabla(\\phi \\circ u)(x) = (\\mathrm{sgn}(x_1), 0)$ for a.e. $x \\in \\Omega$.\n\n4.  **Assess the Naive Chain Rule:**\n    The naive chain rule is $\\nabla(\\phi\\circ u) = D\\phi(u) \\nabla u$. Let's examine the right-hand side. It requires the existence of $D\\phi(u(x))$ for almost every $x \\in \\Omega$.\n    The image of $u$ is $u(\\Omega) \\subset \\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : z_1 = z_2\\}$. This line is a subset of the set $S$ where $\\phi$ is *not* differentiable.\n    Thus, for any $x \\in \\Omega$ (except on the measure-zero set where $x_1=0$), the point $u(x)$ lies in the set of non-differentiability of $\\phi$.\n    This means that the classical derivative $D\\phi(u(x))$ fails to exist for almost every $x \\in \\Omega$. Consequently, the expression $D\\phi(u)\\,\\nabla u$ is not well-defined in the classical sense, and the naive chain rule is meaningless as written.\n\n5.  **Apply the Generalized Chain Rule:**\n    For a Lipschitz function $\\phi$ and a Sobolev function $u \\in W^{1,1}$, the composition $\\phi \\circ u$ is in $W^{1,1}$, and a valid chain rule exists. It states that for almost every $x \\in \\Omega$,\n    $$\n    \\nabla(\\phi\\circ u)(x) = g(x) \\nabla u(x)\n    $$\n    where $g(x)$ is some measurable function (a row vector) such that $g(x) \\in \\partial\\phi(u(x))$ for a.e. $x$. Here $\\partial\\phi(z)$ is the Clarke subdifferential of $\\phi$ at $z$.\n    Let's compute $\\partial\\phi(z)$ for $z$ on the line $z_1=z_2$. Let $z=(t,t)$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The subdifferential is the convex hull of the limits of gradients on sequences converging to $z$.\n    -   If $z_k \\to (t,t)$ with $|(z_k)_1|  |(z_k)_2|$, then $D\\phi(z_k) \\to (\\mathrm{sgn}(t), 0)$.\n    -   If $z_k \\to (t,t)$ with $|(z_k)_2|  |(z_k)_1|$, then $D\\phi(z_k) \\to (0, \\mathrm{sgn}(t))$.\n    Therefore, for $t \\neq 0$:\n    $$\n    \\partial\\phi(t, t) = \\mathrm{conv} \\{ (\\mathrm{sgn}(t), 0), (0, \\mathrm{sgn}(t)) \\} = \\{ (\\lambda\\,\\mathrm{sgn}(t), (1-\\lambda)\\,\\mathrm{sgn}(t)) : \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\}\n    $$\n    We need to find a measurable selection $g(x) = (g_1(x), g_2(x))$ with $g(x) \\in \\partial\\phi(x_1, x_1)$ such that $g(x) \\nabla u(x) = \\nabla(\\phi \\circ u)(x)$ for a.e. $x$.\n    $$\n    g(x) \\nabla u(x) = (g_1(x), g_2(x)) \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} = (g_1(x)+g_2(x), 0)\n    $$\n    We require this to be equal to $\\nabla(\\phi \\circ u)(x) = (\\mathrm{sgn}(x_1), 0)$ a.e. This gives the condition:\n    $$\n    g_1(x) + g_2(x) = \\mathrm{sgn}(x_1)\n    $$\n    Let's check if there exists $g(x) \\in \\partial\\phi(x_1, x_1)$ satisfying this.

For instance, we can choose the simple measurable selection $g(x) = (\\mathrm{sgn}(x_1), 0)$. This selection is in $\\partial\\phi(x_1, x_1)$ (it corresponds to $\\lambda=1$). With this choice, the generalized chain rule holds.\n    The statement about the approximate differential $d_{\\mathrm{ap}}$ is equivalent, as for a Sobolev function $v$, the matrix of $d_{\\mathrm{ap}}v$ is $\\nabla v$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A.

In the same setup, the naive chain rule holds almost everywhere because $\\phi$ is differentiable almost everywhere in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, hence $D\\phi(u(x))$ exists for almost every $x\\in\\Omega$.**\n    This option contains a logical fallacy. While it is true that $\\phi$ is differentiable a.e. in its domain $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (by Rademacher's theorem), this does not imply that the composition $D\\phi(u(x))$ is defined a.e. for $x \\in \\Omega$. The latter depends on the measure of the pre-image of the non-differentiable set, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}^2(\\{x \\in \\Omega : u(x) \\in S\\})$. In this problem, this pre-image has full measure, so $D\\phi(u(x))$ is undefined for a.e. $x$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. In the same setup, the correct chain rule must include a nonzero singular measure supported on the zero set of $u$, namely $D(\\phi\\circ u)=D\\phi(u)\\,Du+\\mu,\\quad \\mu\\neq 0\\text{ singular with }\\mathrm{supp}(\\mu)\\subset\\{x\\in\\Omega:u(x)=0\\}.$**\n    This formula is incorrect for this context. A cornerstone result is that if $\\phi$ is Lipschitz and $u \\in W^{1,p}(\\Omega)$, then the composition $\\phi \\circ u$ is also in $W^{1,p}(\\Omega)$. This means its weak derivative, $D(\\phi \\circ u)$, is a function in $L^p(\\Omega)$, not a general measure with a singular part. Formulas involving singular measures arise in the theory of BV functions, not generally for compositions in Sobolev spaces.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. For every Lipschitz scalar-valued $\\phi$ and every $u\\in W^{1,1}(\\Omega)$, one always has $\\nabla(\\phi\\circ u)=\\phi'(u)\\,\\nabla u$ if one defines $\\phi'$ arbitrarily at points where $\\phi$ is not classically differentiable.**\n    This is false. The replacement for the derivative at non-differentiable points cannot be chosen arbitrarily. As our derivation shows, the replacement must be a measurable selection from the subdifferential $\\partial\\phi(u(x))$ satisfying the chain rule equation. An arbitrary choice will generally fail. For instance, in our example, selecting $g(x) = (1,1)$ for $x_1  0$ is an \"arbitrary\" definition, but it is not in $\\partial \\phi(u(x))$ and leads to the wrong result $(2,0) \\neq (1,0)$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. A universally correct replacement for the chain rule in this setting is $\\nabla(\\phi\\circ u)=h(u)\\,\\nabla u,\\quad h(t)=\\lim_{r\\to 0}\\frac{\\phi(t+r)-\\phi(t)}{r},$ where one may choose any one-sided limit when the two-sided limit does not exist.**\n    This statement is notationally flawed and conceptually wrong. The term $t$ should be a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and $r$ is a scalar. The limit expression resembles a Gâteaux derivative, but it's not properly specified (e.g., $t+r$ is ill-defined). Even if interpreted as a directional derivative, the assertion that one can choose *any* one-sided limit is false. The correct generalization involves the entire set of possible limiting gradients (the subdifferential), not a single, arbitrarily chosen one.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3037167"}]}
