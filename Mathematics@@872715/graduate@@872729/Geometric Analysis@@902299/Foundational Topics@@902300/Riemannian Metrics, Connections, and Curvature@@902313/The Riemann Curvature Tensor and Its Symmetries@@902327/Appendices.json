We are constrained to use only the fundamental definitions of the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ and the Riemann curvature tensor $R$.\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is defined by its action on vector fields $X, Y, Z$ as\n$$R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]} Z$$\nLet's evaluate this in the coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\}$. The commutator of coordinate basis vectors is zero, i.e., $[\\partial_i, \\partial_j] = 0$. Thus, the definition simplifies to\n$$R(\\partial_j, \\partial_k)\\partial_l = \\nabla_j \\nabla_k \\partial_l - \\nabla_k \\nabla_j \\partial_l$$\nwhere we use the shorthand $\\nabla_i \\equiv \\nabla_{\\partial_i}$. The components of the Riemann tensor are defined by $R(\\partial_j, \\partial_k)\\partial_l = R^i{}_{jkl} \\partial_i$.\n\nThe action of the covariant derivative on a basis vector is given by the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ of the Levi-Civita connection: $\\nabla_j \\partial_k = \\Gamma^m_{jk} \\partial_m$. We apply the operator $\\nabla_j$ to the vector field $\\nabla_k \\partial_l = \\Gamma^m_{kl} \\partial_m$:\n$$ \\nabla_j (\\nabla_k \\partial_l) = \\nabla_j(\\Gamma^m_{kl} \\partial_m) = (\\nabla_j \\Gamma^m_{kl})\\partial_m + \\Gamma^m_{kl}(\\nabla_j \\partial_m) $$\nSince $\\Gamma^m_{kl}$ is a scalar function (a component of a tensor), its covariant derivative is its partial derivative, $\\nabla_j \\Gamma^m_{kl} = \\partial_j \\Gamma^m_{kl}$. Substituting this and the definition for $\\nabla_j\\partial_m$ gives:\n$$ \\nabla_j \\nabla_k \\partial_l = (\\partial_j \\Gamma^m_{kl})\\partial_m + \\Gamma^m_{kl} \\Gamma^i_{jm} \\partial_i $$\nRelabeling the dummy summation index $m$ to $i$ in the first term, we get\n$$ \\nabla_j \\nabla_k \\partial_l = (\\partial_j \\Gamma^i_{kl} + \\Gamma^m_{kl}\\Gamma^i_{jm}) \\partial_i $$\nThe $i$-th component of $R(\\partial_j, \\partial_k)\\partial_l$ is therefore\n$$ R^i{}_{jkl} = (\\partial_j \\Gamma^i_{kl} + \\Gamma^m_{kl}\\Gamma^i_{jm}) - (\\partial_k \\Gamma^i_{jl} + \\Gamma^m_{jl}\\Gamma^i_{km}) $$\nNormal coordinates centered at $p$ are defined by the properties that, at the point $p$, the metric is Euclidean, $g_{ij}(p) = \\delta_{ij}$, and the Christoffel symbols vanish, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}(p) = 0$.\nEvaluating the expression for $R^i{}_{jkl}$ at $p$, the terms quadratic in the Christoffel symbols vanish:\n$$ R^i{}_{jkl}(p) = \\partial_j \\Gamma^i_{kl}(p) - \\partial_k \\Gamma^i_{jl}(p) $$\nThe fully covariant components of the Riemann tensor are given by $R_{ijkl} = g_{im} R^m{}_{jkl}$.

Differentiating the formula for $\\Gamma^i_{kl}$ with respect to $x^j$ and evaluating at $p$:\n$$ \\partial_j \\Gamma^i_{kl}(p) = \\frac{1}{2} \\partial_j\\left[g^{im}(\\partial_k g_{lm} + \\partial_l g_{km} - \\partial_m g_{kl})\\right](p) $$\nUsing the product rule, one term contains $\\partial_j g^{im}(p)$ and the other contains second derivatives of $g$. Since $\\partial_m g_{ij}(p)=0$, the first partial derivatives of the inverse metric $g^{im}$ must also vanish at $p$.

The entire space $\\Lambda^{2}(T_{p}M)$ is the eigenspace for this eigenvalue.\n\nFinally, we compute the characteristic polynomial $p_{\\mathcal{R}_{p}}(\\lambda)$. We adopt the standard convention $p_{A}(\\lambda) = \\det(\\lambda \\cdot \\text{Id} - A)$. The operator $\\mathcal{R}_p$ acts on the vector space $V = \\Lambda^{2}(T_{p}M)$. The dimension of this space, let's call it $d$, is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\nd = \\dim(\\Lambda^{2}(T_{p}M)) = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n$$\nThe characteristic polynomial of $\\mathcal{R}_{p}$ is:\n$$\np_{\\mathcal{R}_{p}}(\\lambda) = \\det(\\lambda \\cdot \\text{Id} - \\mathcal{R}_{p})\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathcal{R}_{p} = \\kappa \\cdot \\text{Id}$:\n$$\np_{\\mathcal{R}_{p}}(\\lambda) = \\det(\\lambda \\cdot \\text{Id} - \\kappa \\cdot \\text{Id}) = \\det((\\lambda - \\kappa) \\cdot \\text{Id})\n$$\nIn terms of matrices, if we choose any basis for $\\Lambda^{2}(T_{p}M)$, the operator $(\\lambda - \\kappa) \\cdot \\text{Id}$ is represented by a $d \\times d$ diagonal matrix with $(\\lambda - \\kappa)$ on each diagonal entry. The determinant of such a matrix is the product of its diagonal entries:\n$$\np_{\\mathcal{R}_{p}}(\\lambda) = (\\lambda - \\kappa)^{d} = (\\lambda - \\kappa)^{\\binom{n}{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting the formula for $d$:\n$$\np_{\\mathcal{R}_{p}}(\\lambda) = (\\lambda - \\kappa)^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\n$$\nThis is the characteristic polynomial of the curvature operator $\\mathcal{R}_{p}$ on a manifold of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(\\lambda - \\kappa)^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}}\n$$", "id": "3002440"}]}
