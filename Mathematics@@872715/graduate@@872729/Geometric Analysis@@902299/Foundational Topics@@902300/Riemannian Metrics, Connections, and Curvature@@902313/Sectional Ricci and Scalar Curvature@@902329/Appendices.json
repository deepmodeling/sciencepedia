It is mathematically well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the algebraic form of the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ for a Riemannian manifold $(M^n, g)$ of pointwise constant sectional curvature $K$, and then to compute its Ricci and scalar curvatures.\n\nThe sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)$ of a $2$-plane $\\sigma = \\operatorname{span}\\{u,v\\}$ at a point $p \\in M$ is given by\n$$\nK(\\sigma) = \\frac{R(u,v,v,u)}{g(u,u)g(v,v) - g(u,v)^2}\n$$\nwhere $R(X,Y,Z,W) = g(R(X,Y)Z,W)$. The assumption of pointwise constant sectional curvature $K$ means that for any point $p \\in M$ and any $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p M$, $K(\\sigma)=K$. This implies the following relation for any two linearly independent vectors $u, v \\in T_p M$:\n$$\nR(u,v,v,u) = K \\left( g(u,u)g(v,v) - g(u,v)^2 \\right)\n$$\nThis equality also holds if $u$ and $v$ are linearly dependent, as both sides become zero.\n\nWe seek a $(0,4)$-tensor with the algebraic symmetries of the Riemann tensor that satisfies this condition. The space of such tensors at a point is one-dimensional for $n \\ge 2$. Let us propose the following form for $R$:\n$$\nR_0(X,Y,Z,W) = C \\left( g(X,Z)g(Y,W) - g(X,W)g(Y,Z) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. This tensor satisfies all the required algebraic symmetries:\n1. $R_0(X,Y,Z,W) = -R_0(Y,X,Z,W)$ (skew-symmetry in the first two slots)\n2. $R_0(X,Y,Z,W) = -R_0(X,Y,W,Z)$ (skew-symmetry in the last two slots)\n3. $R_0(X,Y,Z,W) = R_0(Z,W,X,Y)$ (block symmetry)\n4. $R_0(X,Y,Z,W) + R_0(Y,Z,X,W) + R_0(Z,X,Y,W) = 0$ (first Bianchi identity)\n\nBy a standard result in linear algebra (the Schur-Weyl duality for the orthogonal group, or more simply, polarization), any tensor possessing these symmetries is uniquely determined by the values of $R(u,v,v,u)$. We must find the constant $C$ such that $R_0$ matches the given condition for sectional curvature. Let's evaluate $R_0(u,v,v,u)$:\n$$\nR_0(u,v,v,u) = C \\left( g(u,v)g(v,u) - g(u,u)g(v,v) \\right) = -C \\left( g(u,u)g(v,v) - g(u,v)^2 \\right)\n$$\nComparing this with the condition $R(u,v,v,u) = K \\left( g(u,u)g(v,v) - g(u,v)^2 \\right)$, we must have $-C = K$, which implies $C = -K$.\n\nTherefore, the unique algebraic form for the Riemann curvature tensor is:\n$$\nR(X,Y,Z,W) = -K \\left( g(X,Z)g(Y,W) - g(X,W)g(Y,Z) \\right) = K \\left( g(X,W)g(Y,Z) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) \\right)\n$$\nIn index notation, this is $R_{ijkl} = K(g_{il}g_{jk} - g_{ik}g_{jl})$.\n\nNext, we compute the Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}$. Its components are obtained by contracting the Riemann tensor. The standard definition is $\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\operatorname{tr}_g(X \\mapsto R(X,Y)Z)$. Let $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be a local orthonormal basis at a point $p$. The components of the Ricci tensor are given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{jk} = \\mathrm{Ric}(e_j, e_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(R(e_i, e_j)e_k, e_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n R(e_i,e_j,e_k,e_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n R_{ijki}\n$$\nUsing the derived formula for $R_{ijkl}$ and the fact that $g_{ab} = \\delta_{ab}$ in an orthonormal basis:\n$$\nR_{ijki} = K(g_{ii}g_{jk} - g_{ik}g_{ji}) = K(\\delta_{ii}\\delta_{jk} - \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{ji}) = K(\\delta_{jk} - \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{ij})\n$$\nNow, we sum over the index $i$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{jk} = \\sum_{i=1}^n K(\\delta_{jk} - \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{ij}) = K \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_{jk} - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{ij} \\right)\n$$\nThe first summation is $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_{jk} = n\\delta_{jk}$. The second summation is $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{ij} = \\delta_{kj} = \\delta_{jk}$.\nSubstituting these back, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{jk} = K(n\\delta_{jk} - \\delta_{jk}) = (n-1)K\\delta_{jk}\n$$\nThis holds in an orthonormal frame. To express this in a general coordinate-free form, we replace $\\delta_{jk}$ with the metric tensor components $g_{jk}$. Thus, the Ricci tensor is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)K g\n$$\nFinally, we compute the scalar curvature $S$, which is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric $g$:\n$$\nS = \\operatorname{tr}_g(\\mathrm{Ric}) = g^{jk}\\mathrm{Ric}_{jk} = g^{jk} \\left( (n-1)K g_{jk} \\right) = (n-1)K g^{jk}g_{jk}\n$$\nThe contraction $g^{jk}g_{jk} = \\delta^j_j = n$.

The conditions $f(0)=0$ and $f(\\pi)=0$ mean the surface closes at two poles. The conditions $f'(0)=1$ and $f'(\\pi)=-1$ ensure smoothness at these poles. If we consider an embedding into $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with $r$ as the arc length parameter of the profile curve from the north pole, this corresponds to the standard unit sphere $S^2$, which can be parameterized as $(\\sin(r)\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(r)\\sin(\\theta), \\cos(r))$. The topology of this surface is that of a $2$-sphere.\nThe Euler characteristic of the $2$-sphere is $\\chi(S^2)=2$.\nAccording to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the total curvature must be:\n$$\n\\int_M K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\chi(S^2) = 2\\pi(2) = 4\\pi\n$$\nThis value matches our direct calculation.

Thus, $g(\\nabla_{\\bar{X}_1}\\bar{X}_2, \\bar{X}_3) = g_M(\\nabla^M_{X_1}X_2, X_3)$.\n    If we test against a vertical field $W=\\bar{Y}_3$, all terms in the Koszul formula vanish. For instance, $U(g(V, W)) = \\bar{X}_1(g(\\bar{X}_2, \\bar{Y}_3)) = \\bar{X}_1(0) = 0$. $W(g(U,V)) = \\bar{Y}_3(g_M(X_1,X_2)) = 0$ as $g_M(X_1,X_2)$ is a function on $M$ and its derivative in a vertical direction is zero. All bracket terms are also zero.\n    Thus, $g(\\nabla_{\\bar{X}_1}\\bar{X}_2, \\bar{Y}_3) = 0$. This means $\\nabla_{\\bar{X}_1}\\bar{X}_2$ is purely horizontal.\n    We conclude: $\\nabla_{\\bar{X}_1}\\bar{X}_2 = \\overline{\\nabla^M_{X_1}X_2} = (\\nabla^M_{X_1}X_2, 0)$.\n\n2.  **Connection of two vertical fields:** By symmetry, $\\nabla_{\\bar{Y}_1}\\bar{Y}_2 = \\overline{\\nabla^N_{Y_1}Y_2} = (0, \\nabla^N_{Y_1}Y_2)$.\n\n3.  **Connection of mixed fields:** Let $U = \\bar{X}$, $V = \\bar{Y}$. We compute $\\nabla_{\\bar{X}}\\bar{Y}$.\n    Let's test against a horizontal field $W = \\bar{X}'$.\n    $g(V,W)=g(\\bar{Y},\\bar{X}')=0$. $U(g(V,W)) = 0$.\n    $g(U,W)=g(\\bar{X},\\bar{X}')=g_M(X,X')$. $V(g(U,W)) = \\bar{Y}(g_M(X,X'))=0$.\n    $g(U,V)=g(\\bar{X},\\bar{Y})=0$. $W(g(U,V))=0$.\n    The Lie brackets are $[\\bar{Y},\\bar{X}']=0$, $[\\bar{X},\\bar{X}'] = \\overline{[X,X']}$, and $[\\bar{X},\\bar{Y}]=0$.\n    The bracket terms in Koszul's formula are $g(\\bar{X},0)=0$, $g(\\bar{Y},\\overline{[X,X']})=0$, and $g(\\bar{X}',0)=0$.\n    All terms on the right side of the Koszul formula are zero. So $g(\\nabla_{\\bar{X}}\\bar{Y}, \\bar{X}') = 0$.\n    Now test against a vertical field $W = \\bar{Y}'$.\n    $g(V,W) = g(\\bar{Y},\\bar{Y}')=g_N(Y,Y')$. $U(g(V,W)) = \\bar{X}(g_N(Y,Y')) = 0$.\n    $g(U,W)=0$ and $g(U,V)=0$.\n    The Lie brackets are $[\\bar{Y},\\bar{Y}']=\\overline{[Y,Y']}$, $[\\bar{X},\\bar{Y}']=0$, and $[\\bar{X},\\bar{Y}]=0$.\n    The bracket terms give $g(\\bar{X}, \\overline{[Y,Y']})=0$, $g(\\bar{Y},0)=0$, and $g(\\bar{Y}',0)=0$.\n    Again, all terms are zero, so $g(\\nabla_{\\bar{X}}\\bar{Y}, \\bar{Y}') = 0$.\n    Since $\\nabla_{\\bar{X}}\\bar{Y}$ is orthogonal to all horizontal and vertical fields, it must be the zero vector field.\n    $\\nabla_{\\bar{X}}\\bar{Y} = 0$. By torsion-freeness, $\\nabla_{\\bar{Y}}\\bar{X} = \\nabla_{\\bar{X}}\\bar{Y} - [\\bar{Y},\\bar{X}] = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the Riemann curvature tensor $R(U,V)W = \\nabla_U\\nabla_V W - \\nabla_V\\nabla_U W - \\nabla_{[U,V]}W$ for the specific plane in question. The plane is $\\sigma = \\mathrm{span}\\{(X_p,0),(0,Y_q)\\}$. Let $U_0 = (X_p,0)$ and $V_0 = (0,Y_q)$. We choose vector field extensions $\\bar{X}=(X,0)$ and $\\bar{Y}=(0,Y)$ such that $\\bar{X}_{(p,q)} = U_0$ and $\\bar{Y}_{(p,q)} = V_0$. The value of the tensor $R(U_0,V_0)V_0$ is given by evaluating $R(\\bar{X},\\bar{Y})\\bar{Y}$ at $(p,q)$.\n\nWe compute $R(\\bar{X},\\bar{Y})\\bar{Y}$:\n$$\nR(\\bar{X},\\bar{Y})\\bar{Y} = \\nabla_{\\bar{X}}\\nabla_{\\bar{Y}}\\bar{Y} - \\nabla_{\\bar{Y}}\\nabla_{\\bar{X}}\\bar{Y} - \\nabla_{[\\bar{X},\\bar{Y}]}\\bar{Y}\n$$\nUsing the connection formulas derived above:\n-   The first term: $\\nabla_{\\bar{Y}}\\bar{Y} = \\overline{\\nabla^N_Y Y}$. Let $Z = \\nabla^N_Y Y$. This is a vector field on $N$. Then we have $\\nabla_{\\bar{X}}(\\overline{\\nabla^N_Y Y}) = \\nabla_{\\bar{X}}\\bar{Z}$. Since this is a covariant derivative of a vertical field in a horizontal direction, it is zero: $\\nabla_{\\bar{X}}\\bar{Z}=0$.\n-   The second term: $\\nabla_{\\bar{X}}\\bar{Y} = 0$. Therefore, $\\nabla_{\\bar{Y}}(\\nabla_{\\bar{X}}\\bar{Y}) = \\nabla_{\\bar{Y}}(0) = 0$.\n-   The third term: $[\\bar{X},\\bar{Y}] = 0$. Therefore, $\\nabla_{[\\bar{X},\\bar{Y}]}\\bar{Y} = \\nabla_0 \\bar{Y} = 0$.\n\nCombining these, we find that $R(\\bar{X},\\bar{Y})\\bar{Y} = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0$.\nThis holds for all points in $M \\times N$. In particular, at $(p,q)$, we have $R(U_0,V_0)V_0 = 0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)$. The formula is:\n$$\nK(\\sigma) = \\frac{g\\big(R(U_0,V_0)V_0,U_0\\big)}{\\|U_0\\|^{2}\\|V_0\\|^{2} - g(U_0,V_0)^{2}}\n$$\nThe numerator is $g(0, U_0) = 0$.\nFor the denominator, we verify it is non-zero.\n$U_0=(X_p,0)$ and $V_0=(0,Y_q)$, with $X_p \\in T_pM$ and $Y_q \\in T_qN$ being nonzero vectors.\n$\\|U_0\\|^2 = g(U_0,U_0) = g_M(X_p,X_p) + g_N(0,0) = \\|X_p\\|_{g_M}^2  0$.\n$\\|V_0\\|^2 = g(V_0,V_0) = g_M(0,0) + g_N(Y_q,Y_q) = \\|Y_q\\|_{g_N}^2  0$.\n$g(U_0,V_0) = g_M(X_p,0) + g_N(0,Y_q) = 0$.\nThe denominator is $\\|X_p\\|_{g_M}^2 \\|Y_q\\|_{g_N}^2 - 0^2$, which is strictly greater than zero.\nTherefore, the sectional curvature is:\n$$\nK(\\sigma) = \\frac{0}{\\|X_p\\|_{g_M}^2 \\|Y_q\\|_{g_N}^2} = 0\n$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0} $$", "id": "3033424"}]}
