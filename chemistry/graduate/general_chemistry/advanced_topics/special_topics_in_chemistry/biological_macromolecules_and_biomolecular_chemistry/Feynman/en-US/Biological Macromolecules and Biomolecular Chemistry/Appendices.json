To achieve this, it is first necessary to determine the standard molar enthalpy of association in aqueous solution, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{aq}}$, using the provided data. The problem can be solved by constructing a thermodynamic cycle based on Hess's law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a chemical process is independent of the pathway taken.\n\nLet us define the processes involved:\n$1$. Gas-phase association: $D(\\mathrm{g}) + A(\\mathrm{g}) \\to DA(\\mathrm{g})$ with enthalpy change $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{gas}}$.\n$2$.

We can equate the enthalpy changes for the two possible paths in the cycle.\n\nPath $1$ (top route then down): First, association in the gas phase, followed by hydration of the complex.\n$$ \\Delta H_1 = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{gas}} + \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(DA) $$\n\nPath $2$ (down route then right): First, hydration of the individual reactants, followed by association in the aqueous phase.\n$$ \\Delta H_2 = \\left( \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(D) + \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(A) \\right) + \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{aq}} $$\n\nEquating the two paths, $\\Delta H_1 = \\Delta H_2$:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{gas}} + \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(DA) = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(D) + \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(A) + \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{aq}} $$\n\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for the unknown quantity, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{aq}}$:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{aq}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{gas}} + \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(DA) - \\left( \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(D) + \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(A) \\right) $$\n\nThis equation shows that the enthalpy of association in solution is the gas-phase enthalpy corrected for the difference in hydration enthalpies between the product and the reactants. The term $- (\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(D) + \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(A))$ represents the enthalpic cost of desolvating the donor $D$ and acceptor $A$, while $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(DA)$ is the enthalpic gain from solvating the complex $DA$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{gas}} = -31.8\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(D) = -41.4\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(A) = -62.9\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(DA) = -86.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{aq}}$:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{aq}} = (-31.8) + (-86.0) - \\left( (-41.4) + (-62.9) \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{aq}} = -31.8 - 86.0 - (-104.3) $$\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{aq}} = -117.8 + 104.3 $$\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{aq}} = -13.5\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol}^{-1} $$\n\nThe enthalpy of association is significantly less favorable in the aqueous phase ($-13.5\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol}^{-1}$) than in the gas phase ($-31.8\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol}^{-1}$). This is physically correct, as the formation of the hydrogen bond in the complex $DA$ must compete with the strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the individual reactants ($D$ and $A$) and the solvent (water). The energetic penalty associated with removing water molecules from the reactants (desolvation) is not fully compensated by the solvation of the resulting complex.\n\nFinally, we compute the required fraction $f$:\n$$ f = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{aq}}}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}}^{\\mathrm{gas}}} = \\frac{-13.5}{-31.8} $$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{kJ\\ mol}^{-1}$ cancel, and the negative signs cancel, yielding a dimensionless positive number.\n$$ f = \\frac{13.5}{31.8} \\approx 0.4245283... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ f \\approx 0.425 $$",

            "solution": "The problem is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and complete. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe dissociation of the monovalent weak acid $\\mathrm{HA}$ is represented by the equilibrium:\n$$ \\mathrm{HA} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}^{+} + \\mathrm{A}^{-} $$\nThe thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K_{a}^{\\circ}$, is defined in terms of the activities ($a_{i}$) of the species involved, relative to a standard state of unit concentration ($c^{\\circ} = 1\\,\\text{M}$).\n$$ K_{a}^{\\circ} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} a_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}}{a_{\\mathrm{HA}}} $$\nThe activity of each species $i$ is related to its molar concentration $c_{i}$ and its activity coefficient $\\gamma_{i}$ by the definition $a_{i} = \\gamma_{i} (c_{i} / c^{\\circ})$. Substituting this into the expression for $K_{a}^{\\circ}$ gives:\n$$ K_{a}^{\\circ} = \\frac{[\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} (c_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}/c^{\\circ})] [\\gamma_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}} (c_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}/c^{\\circ})]}{[\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HA}} (c_{\\mathrm{HA}}/c^{\\circ})]} = \\left(\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} c_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}}{c_{\\mathrm{HA}}}\\right) \\frac{1}{c^{\\circ}} \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HA}}}\\right) $$\nWe define the apparent concentration-based equilibrium constant as $K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} c_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}}{c_{\\mathrm{HA}}}$. This constant has units of concentration. The expression for $K_{a}^{\\circ}$ becomes:\n$$ K_{a}^{\\circ} = \\frac{K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}}}{c^{\\circ}} \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HA}}}\\right) $$\nTo work with the given $p K_{a}$ values, we take the negative base-$10$ logarithm of both sides. We define the apparent $p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}}$ as the dimensionless quantity $p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}} / c^{\\circ})$.\n$$ -\\log_{10}(K_{a}^{\\circ}) = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}}}{c^{\\circ}}\\right) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HA}}}\\right) $$\nThis yields the relationship:\n$$ p K_{a}^{\\circ} = p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}} - \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}) - \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}) + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HA}}) $$\nRearranging to solve for the apparent $p K_{a}$ gives:\n$$ p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}} = p K_{a}^{\\circ} + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}) + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}) - \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HA}}) $$\nThe problem requires the use of the Debye–Hückel limiting law (DHLL) to estimate the activity coefficients. At $T=298\\,\\text{K}$ in water, the DHLL for an ion $i$ with charge $z_i$ is given by:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\gamma_i) = -A z_i^2 \\sqrt{I} $$\nwhere $A = 0.509$ and $I$ is the ionic strength of the solution. For the ions involved in the dissociation:\nFor $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, the charge is $z_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = +1$, so $\\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}) = -A (+1)^{2} \\sqrt{I} = -A\\sqrt{I}$.\nFor $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$, the charge is $z_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}} = -1$, so $\\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}) = -A (-1)^{2} \\sqrt{I} = -A\\sqrt{I}$.\nFor the neutral acid $\\mathrm{HA}$, its charge is $z_{\\mathrm{HA}} = 0$. The DHLL predicts $\\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HA}}) = 0$, which implies $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HA}} = 1$. This is consistent with the problem's explicit instruction to assume the activity coefficient of the neutral acid is unity.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}}$:\n$$ p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}}(I) = p K_{a}^{\\circ} + (-A\\sqrt{I}) + (-A\\sqrt{I}) - (0) $$\nThis simplifies to the derived expression for the apparent $p K_{a}$ as a function of ionic strength:\n$$ p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}}(I) = p K_{a}^{\\circ} - 2A\\sqrt{I} $$\nNext, we must calculate the ionic strength $I$ of the solution. The ionic strength is defined as $I = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j} c_{j} z_{j}^{2}$, where the sum is over all ionic species in the solution. The solution contains a $1{:}1$ background electrolyte (e.g., $\\mathrm{NaCl}$) at a concentration of $0.10\\,\\text{M}$. Let the electrolyte be $\\mathrm{M}^{+}\\mathrm{X}^{-}$. Then $c_{\\mathrm{M}^{+}} = 0.10\\,\\text{M}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{X}^{-}} = 0.10\\,\\text{M}$. The concentrations of $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$ originating from the dissociation of the weak acid are small compared to the concentration of the background electrolyte, and their contribution to the total ionic strength can be neglected as a valid approximation.\nThus, the ionic strength is determined primarily by the background electrolyte:\n$$ I \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\left( c_{\\mathrm{M}^{+}} z_{\\mathrm{M}^{+}}^{2} + c_{\\mathrm{X}^{-}} z_{\\mathrm{X}^{-}}^{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (0.10)(+1)^{2} + (0.10)(-1)^{2} \\right] $$\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} (0.10 + 0.10) = 0.10\\,\\text{M} $$\nFor the calculation using the DHLL constant $A$, we use the numerical value of $I$, which is $0.10$.\n\nNow, we can compute the value of $p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}}$. We are given $p K_{a}^{\\circ} = 4.75$ and $A = 0.509$.\n$$ p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}} = 4.75 - 2 \\times 0.509 \\times \\sqrt{0.10} $$\n$$ p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}} = 4.75 - 1.018 \\times 0.316227... $$\n$$ p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}} = 4.75 - 0.32188... $$\n$$ p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}} = 4.42811... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}} = 4.428$.\n\nFinally, a discussion on the validity of this estimate is required. The Debye-Hückel limiting law is derived under several key assumptions: ions are treated as point charges, the solvent is a structureless continuum with a constant dielectric permittivity, and the Poisson-Boltzmann equation is linearized. These assumptions are only valid in the limit of infinite dilution ($I \\to 0$). Practically, the DHLL provides accurate results only for very low ionic strengths, typically $I < 0.01\\,\\text{M}$. The ionic strength in this problem is $I = 0.10\\,\\text{M}$, which is an order of magnitude larger than the accepted range of validity for the limiting law. Therefore, our calculated $p K_{a}^{\\mathrm{app}}$ is an approximation, and its deviation from the true experimental value is expected to be significant.\nThe leading-order correction to the DHLL is to account for the finite size of ions, which becomes important as concentration increases and ions cannot approach each other arbitrarily closely. This correction leads to the **Extended Debye-Hückel Equation**:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\gamma_i) = -\\frac{A z_i^2 \\sqrt{I}}{1 + B a \\sqrt{I}} $$\nHere, the parameter '$a$' represents the effective hydrated radius of the ion, and '$B$' is another constant dependent on solvent properties and temperature. This extension reduces the magnitude of the correction to the activity coefficient at higher ionic strengths, providing better agreement with experimental data over a wider concentration range (up to approximately $I \\approx 0.1\\,\\text{M}$).",

Thus, the problem is valid, and a solution can be constructed.\n\n**1) Grand Canonical Partition Function, $Z(pH)$**\n\nThe system consists of three independent titratable sites. For an independent site $i$, the grand canonical partition function, $z_i$, can be constructed by summing the statistical weights of its accessible protonation states. Let a site have two states: protonated ($P_i$) and deprotonated ($D_i$). The equilibrium between them is $P_i \\rightleftharpoons D_i + \\mathrm{H}^+$.\n\nThe ratio of the populations, which is equal to the ratio of their statistical weights ($w$), is governed by the equilibrium constant $K_{a,i}$ and the hydrogen ion activity $a_{\\mathrm{H}^+}$.\n$$ \\frac{[D_i]}{[P_i]} = \\frac{w_{D_i}}{w_{P_i}} = \\frac{K_{a,i}}{a_{\\mathrm{H}^+}} $$\nUsing the definitions $pK_{a,i} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a,i})$ and $pH = -\\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{H}^+})$, we have $K_{a,i} = 10^{-pK_{a,i}}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{H}^+} = 10^{-pH}$.\n$$ \\frac{w_{D_i}}{w_{P_i}} = \\frac{10^{-pK_{a,i}}}{10^{-pH}} = 10^{pH - pK_{a,i}} $$\nWe can define a reference state and assign it a weight of $1$. Let us choose the protonated state $P_i$ as the reference, so $w_{P_i}=1$. Then the weight of the deprotonated state is $w_{D_i} = 10^{pH - pK_{a,i}}$. This choice is arbitrary and does not affect the final physical observables.\n\nThe single-site partition function $z_i(pH)$ is the sum of the weights of its states:\n$$ z_i(pH) = w_{P_i} + w_{D_i} = 1 + 10^{pH - pK_{a,i}} $$\nSince the three sites are assumed to be independent, the total grand canonical partition function for the tripeptide, $Z(pH)$, is the product of the individual site partition functions:\n$$ Z(pH) = z_{\\mathrm{Lys}}(pH) \\cdot z_{\\mathrm{His}}(pH) \\cdot z_{\\mathrm{Asp}}(pH) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for each site, we obtain the closed-form expression for $Z(pH)$:\n$$ Z(pH) = \\left(1 + 10^{pH - pK_a^{\\mathrm{Lys}}}\\right) \\left(1 + 10^{pH - pK_a^{\\mathrm{His}}}\\right) \\left(1 + 10^{pH - pK_a^{\\mathrm{Asp}}}\\right) $$\nwhere $pK_a^{\\mathrm{Lys}} = 10.53$, $pK_a^{\\mathrm{His}} = 6.00$, and $pK_a^{\\mathrm{Asp}} = 3.90$.\n\n**2) Expected Net Charge $\\langle Q(pH)\\rangle$ and Equation for $pI$**\n\nThe expected net charge of the peptide, $\\langle Q(pH)\\rangle$, is the sum of the expected charges of the individual sites due to the linearity of expectation:\n$$ \\langle Q(pH) \\rangle = \\langle q_{\\mathrm{Lys}} \\rangle + \\langle q_{\\mathrm{His}} \\rangle + \\langle q_{\\mathrm{Asp}} \\rangle $$\nThe expected charge of a single site $\\langle q_i \\rangle$ is the sum of the charge of each state multiplied by its probability.

Let's analyze the function $f(pI) = \\langle Q(pI) \\rangle$. We are looking for the root of this function.\nThe species with zero net charge is $(+1, 0, -1)$ for (Lys, His, Asp). This species is expected to be most populated in the $pH$ range between $pK_a^{\\mathrm{His}}=6.00$ and $pK_a^{\\mathrm{Lys}}=10.53$. A common approximation for the $pI$ is the average of the two $pK_a$ values that bracket the neutral state: $pI \\approx \\frac{6.00 + 10.53}{2} = 8.265$. Let us use this value as an initial guess for a numerical method like Newton-Raphson, or use a numerical solver.\n\nLet us rewrite the equation by bringing all terms to one side:\n$$ f(pI) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pI - 10.53}} + \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pI - 6.00}} - \\frac{10^{pI - 3.90}}{1 + 10^{pI - 3.90}} = 0 $$\nUsing a numerical solver for this equation yields the root:\n$$ pI \\approx 8.2667367... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ pI \\approx 8.267 $$\nThis value is physically reasonable, as it lies between the $pK_a$ of the two basic groups, histidine and lysine, and it is far from the $pK_a$ of the acidic group, aspartate. At this $pH$, the aspartate side chain is almost fully deprotonated (charge $\\approx -1$), while the lysine side chain is almost fully protonated (charge $\\approx +1$). The net charge is primarily determined by the titration of the histidine side chain, and the point where $\\langle Q(pI) \\rangle = 0$ is where the partial positive charge on His balances the small deviations of Lys and Asp charges from $+1$ and $-1$, respectively.",
