We shall proceed with its solution using the calculus of variations.\n\nThe total free energy per unit area, $F_{A}$, of the nematic liquid crystal cell is the sum of the bulk elastic energy integrated over the cell thickness $d$, and the surface anchoring energy at the substrate located at $z=0$. The expression is:\n$$ F_{A}[\\theta(z)] = \\int_{0}^{d} f_{b} dz + f_{s}(\\theta(0)) $$\nThe bulk energy density, within the one-constant approximation, is given as $f_{b} = \\frac{1}{2} K (\\frac{d\\theta}{dz})^{2}$.

We apply the calculus of variations. Let the equilibrium profile be perturbed by a small variation $\\delta\\theta(z)$, such that $\\theta(z) \\rightarrow \\theta(z) + \\delta\\theta(z)$. The first variation of the free energy, $\\delta F_{A}$, must be zero for the functional to be at an extremum.\n$$ \\delta F_{A} = \\delta \\left( \\int_{0}^{d} \\frac{1}{2} K \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}\\right)^{2} dz + \\frac{1}{2} W [\\theta(0)]^{2} \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\delta F_{A} = \\int_{0}^{d} K \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}\\right) \\delta\\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}\\right) dz + W \\theta(0) \\delta\\theta(0) $$\nRecognizing that $\\delta(\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}) = \\frac{d}{dz}(\\delta\\theta)$, we integrate the first term by parts:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{d} K \\theta'(z) \\frac{d}{dz}(\\delta\\theta(z)) dz = \\left[ K \\theta'(z) \\delta\\theta(z) \\right]_{0}^{d} - \\int_{0}^{d} K \\theta''(z) \\delta\\theta(z) dz $$\nHere, $\\theta'(z)$ denotes $\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$.

First, considering variations $\\delta\\theta(z)$ that are zero at the boundaries ($z=0$ and $z=d$), the integral term must be zero. This yields the Euler-Lagrange equation for the bulk:\n$$ K \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2} = 0 $$\nThe solution to this differential equation is a linear profile: $\\theta(z) = A z + B$.\n\nNext, the boundary terms in the variation $\\delta F_{A}$ must also sum to zero:\n$$ K \\theta'(d) \\delta\\theta(d) + \\left[ W \\theta(0) - K \\theta'(0) \\right] \\delta\\theta(0) = 0 $$\nSince the variation $\\delta\\theta(0)$ at the surface $z=0$ is arbitrary, its coefficient must be zero.

This signifies that the system is in the strong-anchoring regime. The physical meaning of the extrapolation length is the characteristic scale over which surface anchoring forces dominate elastic forces. A small $\\ell$ relative to the system size $d$ implies that the surface enforces its preferred alignment very effectively, and any deviation from this easy axis is confined to a very thin layer near the surface relative to the total cell thickness. The director orientation is thus \"strongly\" fixed at the boundary.\n\nThe problem asks for only the numerical value of $\\ell$.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound and well-posed. We shall proceed with its solution. The problem consists of two parts: first, a derivation of the relationship between macroscopic optical birefringence, $\\Delta n$, and the nematic scalar order parameter, $S$; second, a calculation of $S$ using provided data.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Relationship between $\\Delta n$ and $S$.\n\nAt optical frequencies, the magnetic permeability of the medium is effectively that of free space, $\\mu_r \\approx 1$. The refractive index, $n$, is therefore related to the relative dielectric permittivity, $\\epsilon_r$, by the Maxwell relation $n^2 = \\epsilon_r$. For an anisotropic medium like a uniaxial nematic liquid crystal, both the dielectric permittivity and the refractive index are tensorial quantities. Let the director, which is the axis of macroscopic uniaxial symmetry, be aligned with the $z$-axis of our laboratory coordinate system. The dielectric tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is diagonal in this frame, with components $\\epsilon_{zz} = \\epsilon_{\\parallel}$ and $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon_{yy} = \\epsilon_{\\perp}$. Consequently, the refractive indices for light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the director are $n_{\\parallel} = \\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\parallel}}$ and $n_{\\perp} = \\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\perp}}$, respectively. The birefringence is defined as $\\Delta n = n_{\\parallel} - n_{\\perp}$.\n\nThe macroscopic dielectric permittivity arises from the collective response of the molecular electric dipoles to an applied electric field. The induced dipole moment $\\mathbf{p}$ of a single molecule is given by $\\mathbf{p} = \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\mathbf{E}_{\\text{loc}}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ is the molecular polarizability tensor and $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{loc}}$ is the local electric field experienced by the molecule. The macroscopic polarization is $\\mathbf{P} = N \\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle$, where $N$ is the number density of molecules and $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes an ensemble average over the molecular orientations.\n\nThe molecular polarizability tensor, in the frame of a rod-like molecule (with its long axis along $z'$), is also uniaxial and diagonal: $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{\\text{mol}} = \\text{diag}(\\alpha_{\\perp,m}, \\alpha_{\\perp,m}, \\alpha_{\\parallel,m})$, where $\\alpha_{\\parallel,m}$ and $\\alpha_{\\perp,m}$ are the polarizabilities parallel and perpendicular to the molecular long axis. To find the macroscopic permittivity, we must average the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ in the lab frame. If $\\theta$ is the angle between the molecular long axis ($z'$) and the director ($z$), the components of the polarizability tensor for a single molecule in the lab frame are:\n$$\n\\alpha_{zz} = \\alpha_{\\parallel,m} \\cos^2\\theta + \\alpha_{\\perp,m} \\sin^2\\theta\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{xx} = (\\alpha_{\\parallel,m} \\sin^2\\theta + \\alpha_{\\perp,m} \\cos^2\\theta)\\cos^2\\phi + \\alpha_{\\perp,m} \\sin^2\\phi\n$$\nwhere $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. Due to the uniaxial symmetry about the director, we average over $\\phi$ to find $\\langle \\alpha_{xx} \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_{yy} \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_{\\perp} \\rangle$.\nThe ensemble-averaged components are:\n$$\n\\langle \\alpha_{\\parallel} \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_{zz} \\rangle = \\alpha_{\\parallel,m} \\langle \\cos^2\\theta \\rangle + \\alpha_{\\perp,m} \\langle \\sin^2\\theta \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\alpha_{\\perp} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle \\alpha_{xx} + \\alpha_{yy} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\alpha_{\\parallel,m}\\sin^2\\theta + \\alpha_{\\perp,m}(\\cos^2\\theta+1) \\rangle\n$$\nThe nematic order parameter is defined as $S = \\langle \\frac{3\\cos^2\\theta-1}{2} \\rangle$.

In this case, $n_{\\parallel} \\approx \\bar{n}$ and $n_{\\perp} \\approx \\bar{n}$, so $n_{\\parallel} + n_{\\perp} \\approx 2\\bar{n}$.\nThe second assumption is that this average refractive index $\\bar{n}$ is effectively constant with respect to changes in the order parameter $S$. This is a valid assumption if the number density $N$ does not change significantly as $S$ varies (e.g., with temperature). The problem specifies that the comparison is made at the same density.\nUnder these assumptions:\n$$\n\\Delta n \\approx \\left(\\frac{C}{2\\bar{n}}\\right) S\n$$\nThis establishes the leading-order linear proportionality between the birefringence $\\Delta n$ and the order parameter $S$. We can write this as $\\Delta n = K \\cdot S$, where $K$ is the proportionality constant.\n\nTo determine $K$, we consider the hypothetical state of perfect molecular alignment. In this state, $\\theta=0$ for all molecules, and the order parameter $S$ takes its maximum value, $S = \\frac{3\\cos^2(0)-1}{2} = 1$. The birefringence in this state is given as $\\Delta n_0$. Substituting this into our linear relation:\n$$\n\\Delta n_0 = K \\cdot (1) \\implies K = \\Delta n_0\n$$\nTherefore, the relationship is:\n$$\n\\Delta n = S \\cdot \\Delta n_0\n$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of $S$.\n\nWe are given the following values:\nThe measured birefringence, $\\Delta n = 0.15$.\nThe birefringence for a perfectly aligned state, $\\Delta n_0 = 0.25$.\n\nUsing the derived relation, we can solve for the order parameter $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\Delta n}{\\Delta n_0}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\nS = \\frac{0.15}{0.25} = \\frac{15}{25} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported to three significant figures.\n$$\nS = 0.600\n$$\nThis value is physically reasonable, as typical nematic liquid crystals at intermediate temperatures exhibit order parameters in the range of $0.4$ to $0.7$.",
