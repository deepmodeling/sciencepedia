The final answer for $\\mu_{\\text{so}}$ should be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, relying on the well-established principles of Crystal Field Theory to explain the electronic properties of transition metal complexes. It is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data ($\\Delta_o$, $P$, energy level definitions) to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free from internal contradictions or factual inaccuracies. The provided values for $\\Delta_o$ and $P$ are physically reasonable for a first-row transition metal complex. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nWe begin by determining the electron configurations and total energies for the high-spin and low-spin cases for a $d^6$ octahedral complex. The total energy, $E$, is the sum of the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE) and the total pairing energy.\n\n1.  **High-Spin ($HS$) Configuration**\n    For a $d^6$ configuration, to maximize spin multiplicity (Hund's rule), electrons are placed singly in all five $d$-orbitals ($t_{2g}$ and $e_g$) before any pairing occurs. The sixth electron then pairs up in one of the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n    - The electronic configuration is $(t_{2g})^4(e_g)^2$.\n    - There are $4$ electrons in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals and $2$ electrons in the $e_g$ orbitals.\n    - The CFSE for the high-spin case is calculated as:\n      $$\n      \\text{CFSE}_{HS} = (4 \\times -0.4\\,\\Delta_o) + (2 \\times +0.6\\,\\Delta_o) = -1.6\\,\\Delta_o + 1.2\\,\\Delta_o = -0.4\\,\\Delta_o\n      $$\n    - In this configuration, there is one pair of electrons in one of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. According to the problem definition, this contributes an energy of $1 \\times P$.\n    - The total electronic energy for the high-spin case, $E_{HS}$, is:\n      $$\n      E_{HS} = \\text{CFSE}_{HS} + \\text{Pairing Energy} = -0.4\\,\\Delta_o + P\n      $$\n\n2.  **Low-Spin ($LS$) Configuration**\n    For the low-spin case, electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals available, which are the $t_{2g}$ orbitals, before occupying the higher-energy $e_g$ orbitals.\n    - All $6$ electrons occupy the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. The electronic configuration is $(t_{2g})^6(e_g)^0$.\n    - There are $6$ electrons in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals and $0$ electrons in the $e_g$ orbitals.\n    - The CFSE for the low-spin case is:\n      $$\n      \\text{CFSE}_{LS} = (6 \\times -0.4\\,\\Delta_o) + (0 \\times +0.6\\,\\Delta_o) = -2.4\\,\\Delta_o\n      $$\n    - In this configuration, the $6$ electrons form $3$ pairs within the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals. This contributes a total pairing energy of $3 \\times P$.\n    - The total electronic energy for the low-spin case, $E_{LS}$, is:\n      $$\n      E_{LS} = \\text{CFSE}_{LS} + \\text{Pairing Energy} = -2.4\\,\\Delta_o + 3P\n      $$\n\n3.  **Condition for Low-Spin Preference**\n    The low-spin configuration is energetically preferred when its total energy is less than that of the high-spin configuration, i.e., $E_{LS} < E_{HS}$.\n    - We set up the inequality:\n      $$\n      -2.4\\,\\Delta_o + 3P < -0.4\\,\\Delta_o + P\n      $$\n    - Rearranging the terms to solve for the relationship between $\\Delta_o$ and $P$:\n      $$\n      3P - P < -0.4\\,\\Delta_o + 2.4\\,\\Delta_o\n      $$\n      $$\n      2P < 2.0\\,\\Delta_o\n      $$\n      $$\n      P < \\Delta_o\n      $$\n    - Thus, the low-spin configuration is favored when the octahedral splitting energy, $\\Delta_o$, is greater than the mean pairing energy, $P$.\n\n4.  **Determination of Spin State and Magnetic Moment**\n    We are given the values $\\Delta_o = 10000\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $P = 15000\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n    - We test the condition for low-spin preference: Is $\\Delta_o > P$?\n    - Substituting the values: Is $10000\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}} > 15000\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$?\n    - The inequality is false. Since $\\Delta_o < P$, the system will adopt the configuration with the lower pairing energy cost, which is the high-spin configuration.\n    - The favored spin state is **high-spin**.\n    - The high-spin configuration is $(t_{2g})^4(e_g)^2$. The electron arrangement is $(\\uparrow\\downarrow \\uparrow \\uparrow)$ in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals and $(\\uparrow \\uparrow)$ in the $e_g$ orbitals.\n    - The number of unpaired electrons, $n$, is the sum of unpaired electrons in both sets of orbitals: $n = 2 (\\text{from } t_{2g}) + 2 (\\text{from } e_g) = 4$.\n    - The spin-only magnetic moment, $\\mu_{\\text{so}}$, is calculated using the formula:\n      $$\n      \\mu_{\\text{so}} = \\sqrt{n(n+2)}\\ \\mu_B\n      $$\n    - Substituting $n=4$:\n      $$\n      \\mu_{\\text{so}} = \\sqrt{4(4+2)}\\ \\mu_B = \\sqrt{4 \\times 6}\\ \\mu_B = \\sqrt{24}\\ \\mu_B\n      $$\n    - Now we compute the numerical value and round to $3$ significant figures:\n      $$\n      \\mu_{\\text{so}} \\approx 4.898979...\\ \\mu_B\n      $$\n      $$\n      \\mu_{\\text{so}} \\approx 4.90\\ \\mu_B\n      $$\nThe final required answer is the numerical value of the magnetic moment.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the average formal oxidation state of iron in two different redox states of the P-cluster of nitrogenase, which has an inorganic core idealized as $\\mathrm{Fe}_{8}\\mathrm{S}_{7}$. The fundamental principle governing this calculation is the conservation of charge. The sum of the formal oxidation states of all constituent atoms in a polyatomic ion must equal the net charge of that ion.\n\nLet $N_{Fe}$ represent the number of iron atoms and $N_{S}$ represent the number of sulfur atoms in the cluster core.

The problem states that every sulfide is a formal sulfide, which has an oxidation state of $-2$. Let us denote this as $x_{S}$.\n$$ x_{S} = -2 $$\n\nThe total charge, $Q$, of the inorganic core is the sum of the charges contributed by all iron and sulfur atoms.

The formal description would be a mixture of $\\mathrm{Fe}^{0}$, $\\mathrm{Fe}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$, or $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ions, with the average oxidation state being $+\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nFor the more oxidized state, $P^{OX}$:\nThe problem provides the total charge $Q = -5$.

The difference in total charge between $P^{OX}$ and $P^{N}$ is $((-5) - (-7)) = +2$, corresponding to a two-electron oxidation. This two-electron change distributed over $8$ iron atoms results in an increase of the average oxidation state by $\\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard problem in chemical kinetics, specifically pseudo-order reactions, based on established principles of bioinorganic chemistry. All data are provided and are physically plausible. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, of the active enzyme, $\\mathrm{E_{act}}$, which undergoes inactivation via an elementary bimolecular reaction with molecular oxygen, $\\mathrm{O_2}$.\nThe reaction is given as:\n$$ \\mathrm{E_{act}} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{E_{inact}} $$\nThe rate of this reaction, defined as the rate of disappearance of $\\mathrm{E_{act}}$, is governed by the law of mass action. For an elementary step, the rate is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants. Let $[\\mathrm{E_{act}}]$ and $[\\mathrm{O_2}]$ be the molar concentrations of the active enzyme and dissolved oxygen, respectively. The rate law is:\n$$ \\text{Rate} = -\\frac{d[\\mathrm{E_{act}}]}{dt} = k [\\mathrm{E_{act}}] [\\mathrm{O_2}] $$\nHere, $k$ is the second-order rate constant, given as $k = 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nA critical piece of information is that the concentration of dissolved oxygen, $[\\mathrm{O_2}]$, is maintained at a constant value of $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$. This is a key approximation. It is physically justified by the problem statement: the oxygen concentration is buffered by surrounding compartments, and the total enzyme concentration is low enough not to deplete the local oxygen pool significantly. This condition simplifies the kinetics from second-order to pseudo-first-order.\n\nWe can combine the constant terms $k$ and $[\\mathrm{O_2}]$ into a new, effective rate constant, which we shall call the pseudo-first-order rate constant, $k'$.\n$$ k' = k [\\mathrm{O_2}] $$\nThe rate law now takes the form of a first-order reaction:\n$$ -\\frac{d[\\mathrm{E_{act}}]}{dt} = k' [\\mathrm{E_{act}}] $$\nTo find the concentration of $\\mathrm{E_{act}}$ as a function of time, we must solve this linear first-order ordinary differential equation.
