            "problem": "An octahedral complex with octahedral symmetry ($O_h$) exhibits a measured octahedral crystal-field splitting $\\Delta_{o} = 18000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ from its lowest-energy spin-allowed $d \\rightarrow d$ absorption band. Using the framework of Ligand Field Theory (LFT), and starting from the definitions of the octahedral barycenter and the degeneracies of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ sets, derive the relative energetic positions of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ levels with respect to the barycenter. Then, assuming a low-spin $d^4$ configuration, determine the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE) relative to the barycenter and convert this energy to $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. \n\nIn your derivation, explicitly identify:\n- The electron occupation of $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ for a low-spin $d^4$ ion in an octahedral field.\n- The relationship between $\\Delta_{o}$ and the energy offsets of $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ from the barycenter, without invoking any memorized shortcut expressions.\n- Your assumptions for converting wavenumbers (in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) to molar energy, including any physical constants you assume and the reference medium (for example, vacuum values for the speed of light).\n\nAssume that the CFSE you report excludes explicit electron pairing-energy contributions and Jahn–Teller distortions.

The final answer must be a single real number.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. It presents a standard application of Ligand Field Theory and is therefore valid for a full analysis. We shall proceed by deriving the required quantities from first principles, as is proper.\n\nThe central concept is the splitting of the five degenerate $d$-orbitals of a transition metal ion under the influence of an octahedral ligand field. In $O_h$ symmetry, these orbitals split into two sets: a triply degenerate set of lower energy, labeled $t_{2g}$, and a doubly degenerate set of higher energy, labeled $e_g$.\n\nThe barycenter, or the weighted-average energy of the orbitals, must be conserved. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the ligand field perturbs the orbital energies but does not add or remove energy from the system as a whole. Let the energy of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals relative to the barycenter be $E_{t_{2g}}$ and the energy of the $e_g$ orbitals be $E_{e_g}$. The degeneracies of these sets are $g(t_{2g})=3$ and $g(e_g)=2$. The barycenter rule is expressed mathematically as:\n$$g(t_{2g}) \\cdot E_{t_{2g}} + g(e_g) \\cdot E_{e_g} = 0$$\n$$3 E_{t_{2g}} + 2 E_{e_g} = 0$$\nThis is our first equation.\n\nThe octahedral crystal-field splitting parameter, $\\Delta_{o}$, is defined as the energy difference between the $e_g$ and $t_{2g}$ levels.\n$$E_{e_g} - E_{t_{2g}} = \\Delta_o$$\nThis is our second equation. We now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $E_{t_{2g}}$ and $E_{e_g}$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we express $E_{e_g}$ in terms of $E_{t_{2g}}$:\n$$E_{e_g} = E_{t_{2g}} + \\Delta_o$$\nSubstituting this into the first equation yields:\n$$3 E_{t_{2g}} + 2(E_{t_{2g}} + \\Delta_o) = 0$$\n$$3 E_{t_{2g}} + 2 E_{t_{2g}} + 2 \\Delta_o = 0$$\n$$5 E_{t_{2g}} = -2 \\Delta_o$$\n$$E_{t_{2g}} = -\\frac{2}{5} \\Delta_o = -0.4 \\Delta_o$$\nThe $t_{2g}$ orbitals are thus stabilized by an amount of $0.4\\,\\Delta_o$ relative to the barycenter.\n\nNow, we solve for $E_{e_g}$:\n$$E_{e_g} = E_{t_{2g}} + \\Delta_o = -\\frac{2}{5} \\Delta_o + \\Delta_o = \\frac{3}{5} \\Delta_o = +0.6 \\Delta_o$$\nThe $e_g$ orbitals are destabilized by an amount of $0.6\\,\\Delta_o$ relative to the barycenter. This completes the required derivation.\n\nThe problem specifies a low-spin $d^4$ configuration. In a low-spin octahedral complex, the field splitting $\\Delta_o$ is large enough to overcome the electron pairing energy. Therefore, electrons fill the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals completely before occupying the higher-energy $e_g$ orbitals. For a $d^4$ ion, all four electrons will occupy the $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\nThe electron configuration is therefore $(t_{2g})^4 (e_g)^0$.\n\nThe Crystal Field Stabilization Energy ($\\mathrm{CFSE}$) is the net energy change of the $d$-electrons relative to the barycenter. It is calculated by summing the energies of each electron.\n$$\\mathrm{CFSE} = n_{t_{2g}} \\cdot E_{t_{2g}} + n_{e_g} \\cdot E_{e_g}$$\nwhere $n_{t_{2g}}$ and $n_{e_g}$ are the numbers of electrons in the respective orbitals.\n$$\\mathrm{CFSE} = 4 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{2}{5} \\Delta_o\\right) + 0 \\cdot \\left(+\\frac{3}{5} \\Delta_o\\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{CFSE} = -\\frac{8}{5} \\Delta_o = -1.6 \\Delta_o$$\nNote that this calculation, as per the problem's directive, excludes the pairing energy ($P$) required to place two electrons in the same $t_{2g}$ orbital.\n\nA brief comment on the Jahn-Teller effect: The Jahn-Teller theorem predicts that a non-linear molecule with an electronically degenerate ground state will distort to remove this degeneracy and lower its energy. For a low-spin $d^4$ configuration, $(t_{2g})^4 (e_g)^0$, the $t_{2g}$ orbitals are asymmetrically occupied (e.g., $(d_{xy})^2 (d_{xz})^1 (d_{yz})^1$). This leads to a triply degenerate ground state term ($^3T_{1g}$), so a Jahn-Teller distortion is indeed expected. However, distortions arising from degeneracy within the $t_{2g}$ set are typically weaker than those from degeneracy within the $e_g$ set.\n\nWe now proceed to the numerical calculation. The problem provides $\\Delta_o = 18000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nFirst, we find the $\\mathrm{CFSE}$ in units of wavenumbers ($\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$):\n$$\\mathrm{CFSE} = -1.6 \\times 18000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = -28800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nTo convert this energy to $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, we use the relation $E = hc\\bar{\\nu}$, where $E$ is the energy of a photon, $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\bar{\\nu}$ is the wavenumber. To find the molar energy, we multiply by Avogadro's constant, $N_A$.\n$$E_{\\text{molar}} = N_A h c \\bar{\\nu}$$\nWe assume the use of the following fundamental constants (CODATA 2018 values):\n- Planck's constant, $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- Speed of light in vacuum, $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Avogadro's constant, $N_A = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n\nThe wavenumber $\\bar{\\nu}$ must be in units of $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ for dimensional consistency. We convert from $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ by multiplying by $100\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}/\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n$$E_{\\text{molar}} (\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) = N_A h c \\times \\bar{\\nu}(\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\times 100$$\nLet's compute the conversion factor:\n$$N_A h c \\times 100 = (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}) \\times (6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}) \\times (2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}) \\times 100$$\n$$N_A h c \\times 100 \\approx 11.9626565\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\text{ per }\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\nTo get the energy in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, we divide by $1000$.\n$$E_{\\text{molar}} (\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) = \\bar{\\nu}(\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\times 0.0119626565 \\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}$$\nNow, we calculate the final numerical value for the $\\mathrm{CFSE}$:\n$$\\mathrm{CFSE} = -28800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\times 0.0119626565 \\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}$$\n$$\\mathrm{CFSE} \\approx -344.5245\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested gives $-344.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.

A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three required tasks in sequence.\n\n1) Derivation of Total Electronic Energy Expressions\n\nIn an octahedral ligand field, the five degenerate $d$-orbitals of the free metal ion are split into two sets: a lower-energy, triply degenerate $t_{2g}$ set and a higher-energy, doubly degenerate $e_{g}$ set. The energy of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals is $-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o}$ and the energy of the $e_{g}$ orbitals is $+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{o}$ relative to the barycenter of the $d$-orbitals.\n\nThe total electronic energy ($E$) of a given configuration is the sum of the energies of all electrons in their respective orbitals (the crystal field stabilization energy, CFSE) and the total energy cost of pairing electrons within the same orbital ($N_{pairs}P$), where $N_{pairs}$ is the total number of electron pairs.\n$E = \\text{CFSE} + N_{pairs}P = \\left( n_{t_{2g}} \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) + n_{e_{g}} \\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) \\right) + N_{pairs}P$\n\nFor a $d^{6}$ configuration, two spin states are possible: high-spin (HS) and low-spin (LS).\n\nHigh-Spin (HS) Configuration:\nElectrons are placed to maximize the total spin, following Hund's rule as much as possible. This leads to the configuration $(t_{2g})^{4}(e_{g})^{2}$.\n- Number of electrons in $t_{2g}$, $n_{t_{2g}} = 4$.\n- Number of electrons in $e_{g}$, $n_{e_{g}} = 2$.\n- The distribution is $(\\uparrow\\downarrow)_{t_{2g}} (\\uparrow)_{t_{2g}} (\\uparrow)_{t_{2g}} (\\uparrow)_{e_{g}} (\\uparrow)_{e_{g}}$.\n- This configuration contains one pair of electrons. Thus, $N_{pairs, HS} = 1$.\nThe total electronic energy for the high-spin state is:\n$E_{HS} = \\left( 4 \\times \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) + 2 \\times \\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) \\right) + 1 \\times P$\n$E_{HS} = \\left(-\\frac{8}{5}\\Delta_{o} + \\frac{6}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) + P$\n$E_{HS} = -\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o} + P$\n\nLow-Spin (LS) Configuration:\nElectrons are placed to fill the lowest energy orbitals first, which may require pairing them against Hund's rule. This leads to the configuration $(t_{2g})^{6}(e_{g})^{0}$.\n- Number of electrons in $t_{2g}$, $n_{t_{2g}} = 6$.\n- Number of electrons in $e_{g}$, $n_{e_{g}} = 0$.\n- The distribution is $(\\uparrow\\downarrow)_{t_{2g}} (\\uparrow\\downarrow)_{t_{2g}} (\\uparrow\\downarrow)_{t_{2g}}$.\n- This configuration contains three pairs of electrons. Thus, $N_{pairs, LS} = 3$.\nThe total electronic energy for the low-spin state is:\n$E_{LS} = \\left( 6 \\times \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) + 0 \\times \\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) \\right) + 3 \\times P$\n$E_{LS} = -\\frac{12}{5}\\Delta_{o} + 3P$\n\n2) Determination of the Thermodynamically Favored Spin State\n\nThe ground state of the complex will be the spin state with the lower total electronic energy. We compare $E_{HS}$ and $E_{LS}$ using the given values: $\\Delta_{o} = 15000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $P = 17000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\n$E_{HS} = -\\frac{2}{5}(15000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) + (17000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) = -6000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} + 17000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 11000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$E_{LS} = -\\frac{12}{5}(15000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) + 3(17000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) = -36000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} + 51000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 15000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n\nSince $E_{HS} (11000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) < E_{LS} (15000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$, the **high-spin state** is thermodynamically favored and represents the electronic ground state.\n\nNext, we evaluate if thermal population of the higher-energy low-spin state is significant at $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$. The energy difference between the states is:\n$\\Delta E = E_{LS} - E_{HS} = 15000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 11000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 4000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nThe thermal energy available at $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ is $k_{B}T$. We must express this in the same units as $\\Delta E$.\n$k_{B}T (\\text{in cm}^{-1}) = \\frac{k_{B}T}{hc} = \\frac{(1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(298\\ \\mathrm{K})}{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})(2.998 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1})} \\approx 207\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nThe ratio of the population of the excited (LS) state, $N_{LS}$, to the ground (HS) state, $N_{HS}$, is given by the Boltzmann distribution, accounting for degeneracies ($g$):\n$\\frac{N_{LS}}{N_{HS}} = \\frac{g_{LS}}{g_{HS}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_{B}T}\\right)$\n\nThe degeneracies ($g = \\text{spin multiplicity} \\times \\text{orbital degeneracy}$) are:\n- For HS $d^{6}$ ($(t_{2g})^4(e_{g})^2$), the ground term is $^{5}T_{2g}$. Spin multiplicity $2S+1 = 5$. Orbital degeneracy is $3$. Total degeneracy $g_{HS} = 5 \\times 3 = 15$.\n- For LS $d^{6}$ ($(t_{2g})^6$), the ground term is $^{1}A_{1g}$. Spin multiplicity $2S+1 = 1$. Orbital degeneracy is $1$. Total degeneracy $g_{LS} = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nThe population ratio is:\n$\\frac{N_{LS}}{N_{HS}} = \\frac{1}{15} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}{207\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{15} \\exp(-19.3) \\approx 4.6 \\times 10^{-10}$.\n\nThis ratio is exceedingly small. The population of the low-spin excited state is negligible at room temperature. Therefore, the complex can be considered to exist exclusively in the high-spin ground state.\n\n3) Estimation of the Spin-Only Magnetic Moment\n\nThe spin-only magnetic moment, $\\mu_{\\text{so}}$, is calculated from the number of unpaired electrons, $n$, using the formula:\n$\\mu_{\\text{so}} = \\sqrt{n(n+2)}$ (in units of Bohr magnetons, BM).\n\nAs established, the ground state is the high-spin $d^{6}$ configuration, $(t_{2g})^{4}(e_{g})^{2}$. The electron arrangement is:\n- $t_{2g}$ orbitals: one is doubly occupied, two are singly occupied.\n- $e_{g}$ orbitals: both are singly occupied.\nThe number of unpaired electrons is $n = 2 (\\text{from } t_{2g}) + 2 (\\text{from } e_{g}) = 4$.\n\nSubstituting $n=4$ into the formula:\n$\\mu_{\\text{so}} = \\sqrt{4(4+2)} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 6} = \\sqrt{24}$ BM.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value and round to three significant figures:\n$\\mu_{\\text{so}} = \\sqrt{24} \\approx 4.898979...$ BM.\nRounding to three significant figures gives $\\mu_{\\text{so}} = 4.90$ BM.\n\nThe problem specified that weak Jahn-Teller distortions should be ignored for the purpose of this estimate. The ground state term $^5T_{2g}$ is indeed orbitally degenerate and susceptible to such distortion. However, as instructed, this does not change the number of unpaired electrons, so our calculation of $n=4$ remains correct under the problem's constraints.",

Using the first transition:\n$$\nE_{1} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{1} = 12,420\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{E_{1}}{B} = 18.0 \\implies B = \\frac{E_{1}}{18.0} = \\frac{12,420\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}{18.0} = 690\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nTo ensure consistency, we verify this result using the second transition:\n$$\nE_{2} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{2} = 18,630\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{E_{2}}{B} = 27.0 \\implies B = \\frac{E_{2}}{27.0} = \\frac{18,630\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}{27.0} = 690\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe results are identical, which confirms our value of $B = 690\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we determine the ligand field splitting parameter $\\Delta_{o}$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{o} = 20 \\times B = 20 \\times 690\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 13,800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the nephelauxetic ratio, $\\beta$, which measures the reduction of the interelectronic repulsion parameter in the complex compared to the free ion. It is defined as $\\beta = B/B_{0}$. The problem provides the free-ion Racah parameter for $\\mathrm{V}^{3+}$ as $B_{0} = 860\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{B}{B_{0}} = \\frac{690\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}{860\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}} = \\frac{69}{86}\n$$\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$$\n\\beta \\approx 0.8023255...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\beta \\approx 0.8023\n$$\nThis value indicates a significant degree of covalency in the metal-ligand bonds, as expected.",
