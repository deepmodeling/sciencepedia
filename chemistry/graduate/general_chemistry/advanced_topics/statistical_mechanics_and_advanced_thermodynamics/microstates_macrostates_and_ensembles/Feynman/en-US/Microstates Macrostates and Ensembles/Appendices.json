This exercise provides a fundamental hands-on application of this principle.

We need to find the number of microstates, $\\Omega$, corresponding to this macrostate.\n\n1.  **Define particle distribution:** Let $n_0$ be the number of atoms in the ground state (energy $\\epsilon_0=0$) and $n_1$ be the number of atoms in the excited state (energy $\\epsilon_1=\\epsilon$).\n\n2.  **Apply physical constraints:** The system is defined by two conservation laws:\n    -   Conservation of particles: The total number of atoms is fixed.\n        $$ n_0 + n_1 = N $$\n    -   Conservation of energy: The total energy of the system is fixed.\n        $$ n_0 \\epsilon_0 + n_1 \\epsilon_1 = E $$\n        Substituting the energy values, we get:\n        $$ n_0 \\cdot 0 + n_1 \\cdot \\epsilon = E $$\n        $$ n_1 \\epsilon = E $$\n\n3.  **Determine the number of atoms in each state:** From the energy constraint, we can directly solve for the number of atoms in the excited state:\n    $$ n_1 = \\frac{E}{\\epsilon} $$\n    Note that for this to be physically possible, $E$ must be an integer multiple of $\\epsilon$.\n    Now, using the particle conservation equation, we find the number of atoms in the ground state:\n    $$ n_0 = N - n_1 = N - \\frac{E}{\\epsilon} $$\n    For a valid configuration, we must have $0 \\le n_1 \\le N$, which implies $0 \\le E \\le N\\epsilon$.\n\n4.  **Count the number of microstates:** A specific microstate corresponds to a specific assignment of states to each of the $N$ distinguishable atoms. We can calculate the total number of ways to realize the macrostate $(N, E)$ in two steps:\n    -   **Step A: Distributing the atoms.** We need to choose which of the $N$ distinguishable atoms will be in the excited state. The number of ways to choose $n_1$ atoms from a set of $N$ is given by the binomial coefficient:\n        $$ C(N, n_1) = \\binom{N}{n_1} = \\frac{N!}{n_1!(N-n_1)!} $$\n    -   **Step B: Arranging atoms within the energy levels.** We must account for the degeneracy of the energy levels.\n        -   The $n_1$ atoms in the excited state can each occupy any of the $g$ available degenerate states. Since the atoms are distinguishable, the total number of ways to arrange them in the excited sublevels is $g^{n_1}$.\n        -   The $n_0$ atoms in the ground state are in a non-degenerate level ($g_0=1$). There is only one state available for each, so there is only $1^{n_0} = 1$ way to arrange them.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of microstates:** The total number of accessible microstates, $\\Omega(N, E, g)$, is the product of the number of possibilities from each step.\n    $$ \\Omega = \\binom{N}{n_1} \\times g^{n_1} \\times 1^{n_0} $$\n    Substituting the expressions for $n_1$ and $n_0$:\n    $$ \\Omega(N, E, g) = \\binom{N}{E/\\epsilon} \\cdot g^{E/\\epsilon} \\cdot 1^{N-E/\\epsilon} $$\n    $$ \\Omega(N, E, g) = \\binom{N}{E/\\epsilon} g^{E/\\epsilon} $$\n    Expanding the binomial coefficient, we arrive at the final expression:\n    $$ \\Omega(N, E, g) = \\frac{N!}{(E/\\epsilon)!(N - E/\\epsilon)!} g^{E/\\epsilon} $$",

            "solution": "The system consists of a collection of non-interacting, distinguishable molecules. For such a system, the total partition function is the product of the single-molecule partition functions. We are asked for properties on a per-molecule basis, so we begin by constructing the canonical partition function for a single molecule, denoted by $Z$.\n\nA single molecule has two accessible energy levels, $E_1 = 0$ and $E_2 = \\epsilon$, both of which are nondegenerate (degeneracy $g_1 = 1$, $g_2 = 1$). The single-molecule partition function $Z$ is defined as the sum over all states $i$ of the Boltzmann factor $\\exp(-\\beta E_i)$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n$$Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} g_i \\exp(-\\beta E_i) = g_1 \\exp(-\\beta E_1) + g_2 \\exp(-\\beta E_2)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$Z = 1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\beta \\cdot 0) + 1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon) = 1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)$$\nThis is the single-molecule partition function.\n\nNext, we derive the mean energy per molecule, $\\langle E \\rangle$. This is obtained from the partition function using the relation:\n$$\\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial \\beta}$$\nWe first compute the derivative of $Z$ with respect to $\\beta$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} (1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)) = -\\epsilon \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)$$\nNow, substituting this into the expression for $\\langle E \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)} (-\\epsilon \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)) = \\frac{\\epsilon \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)}$$\nThis is the mean energy per molecule. It can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(\\beta \\epsilon)$:\n$$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\exp(\\beta \\epsilon) + 1}$$\n\nThe constant-volume heat capacity per molecule, $C_V$, is defined as the partial derivative of the mean energy with respect to temperature at constant volume:\n$$C_V = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\langle E \\rangle}{\\partial T} \\right)_V$$\nIt is more convenient to perform the differentiation with respect to $\\beta$. Using the chain rule, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} = \\frac{d\\beta}{dT} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}$, and noting that $\\frac{d\\beta}{dT} = \\frac{d}{dT} (k_B T)^{-1} = -k_B (k_B T)^{-2} = -k_B \\beta^2$, we have:\n$$C_V = -k_B \\beta^2 \\frac{\\partial \\langle E \\rangle}{\\partial \\beta}$$\nWe differentiate the expression for $\\langle E \\rangle = \\epsilon ( \\exp(\\beta \\epsilon) + 1 )^{-1}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\langle E \\rangle}{\\partial \\beta} = \\epsilon \\cdot (-1) (\\exp(\\beta \\epsilon) + 1)^{-2} \\cdot (\\epsilon \\exp(\\beta \\epsilon)) = -\\frac{\\epsilon^2 \\exp(\\beta \\epsilon)}{(\\exp(\\beta \\epsilon) + 1)^2}$$\nSubstituting this derivative back into the expression for $C_V$:\n$$C_V = -k_B \\beta^2 \\left( -\\frac{\\epsilon^2 \\exp(\\beta \\epsilon)}{(\\exp(\\beta \\epsilon) + 1)^2} \\right) = k_B (\\beta \\epsilon)^2 \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\epsilon)}{(\\exp(\\beta \\epsilon) + 1)^2}$$\nThis characteristic temperature dependence of the heat capacity for a two-level system is known as a Schottky anomaly.\n\nTo find the temperature $T^{\\star}$ at which $C_V$ is maximum, we must find the extremum of $C_V$ with respect to temperature, or equivalently, with respect to $\\beta$. Let us define a dimensionless variable $x = \\beta \\epsilon = \\epsilon / (k_B T)$. The heat capacity can be written as a function of $x$:\n$$C_V(x) = k_B \\frac{x^2 \\exp(x)}{(\\exp(x) + 1)^2}$$\nTo find the maximum, we set the derivative of $C_V(x)$ with respect to $x$ to zero. To simplify the differentiation, we can analyze the function $f(x) = x^2 \\exp(x) (\\exp(x) + 1)^{-2}$ and find where its derivative is zero. Taking the logarithmic derivative is an efficient approach:\n$$\\ln f(x) = 2 \\ln x + x - 2 \\ln(\\exp(x) + 1)$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{1}{f(x)} \\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{2}{x} + 1 - 2 \\frac{\\exp(x)}{\\exp(x) + 1}$$\nSetting the derivative to zero implies the right-hand side is zero:\n$$\\frac{2}{x} + 1 - \\frac{2 \\exp(x)}{\\exp(x) + 1} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{2}{x} = \\frac{2 \\exp(x)}{\\exp(x) + 1} - 1 = \\frac{2 \\exp(x) - (\\exp(x) + 1)}{\\exp(x) + 1} = \\frac{\\exp(x) - 1}{\\exp(x) + 1}$$\nThis can be simplified by recognizing the hyperbolic tangent function, $\\tanh(y) = \\frac{\\exp(2y)-1}{\\exp(2y)+1}$. Here we have:\n$$\\frac{\\exp(x) - 1}{\\exp(x) + 1} = \\frac{\\exp(x/2) (\\exp(x/2) - \\exp(-x/2))}{\\exp(x/2) (\\exp(x/2) + \\exp(-x/2))} = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$$\nSo, the condition for the maximum is:\n$$\\frac{2}{x} = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2 = x \\tanh\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for the value of $x$, let's call it $x^{\\star}$, that maximizes the heat capacity. It must be solved numerically. Let $y = x/2$, the equation becomes $2y \\tanh(y) = 2$, or $y \\tanh(y) = 1$. This is equivalent to $y = \\coth(y)$.\n\nNumerical solution of $y = \\coth(y)$ yields a value $y^{\\star} \\approx 1.19967864$.\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that maximizes $C_V$ is $x^{\\star} = 2y^{\\star} \\approx 2.39935728$.\n\nThe problem asks for the quantity $T^{\\star} (k_B / \\epsilon)$, where $T^{\\star}$ is the temperature at which $C_V$ is maximized.\nWe have $x^{\\star} = \\epsilon / (k_B T^{\\star})$. Rearranging for the desired quantity gives:\n$$\\frac{T^{\\star} k_B}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{x^{\\star}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical value of $x^{\\star}$:\n$$\\frac{T^{\\star} k_B}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{2.39935728} \\approx 0.4167793$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the result is $0.4168$.",
