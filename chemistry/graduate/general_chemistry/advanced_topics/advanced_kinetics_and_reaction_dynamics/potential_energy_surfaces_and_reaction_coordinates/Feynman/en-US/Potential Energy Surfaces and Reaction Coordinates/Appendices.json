This first practice uses a classic one-dimensional double-well potential, a fundamental model that captures the essence of a simple isomerization or transfer reaction. By analytically finding the stationary points and examining their stability, you will solidify your understanding of reactant states, product states, and the transition state that lies between them, and derive the characteristic imaginary frequency that defines the unstable motion along the reaction coordinate at the transition state .",

Let $m$ denote the constant effective mass associated with motion along the reaction coordinate $q$. The transition state (also called the saddle point) along the reaction coordinate is defined as a stationary point of $V(q)$ with negative curvature along $q$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed problem in classical mechanics and physical chemistry, grounded in the standard theoretical framework of reaction dynamics on a potential energy surface. All terms are clearly defined, and sufficient information is provided to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe potential energy surface, $V(q)$, is given by the one-dimensional quartic function:\n$$V(q) = a q^4 - b q^2$$\nwhere $a > 0$ and $b > 0$. The parameters ensure a symmetric double-well potential, with two minima separated by a barrier.\n\nFirst, we must identify the stationary points of the potential. Stationary points are locations where the force, and thus the gradient of the potential, is zero. We compute the first derivative of $V(q)$ with respect to the reaction coordinate $q$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dq} = \\frac{d}{dq}(a q^4 - b q^2) = 4 a q^3 - 2 b q$$\nSetting $\\frac{dV}{dq} = 0$:\n$$4 a q^3 - 2 b q = 0$$\n$$2q(2aq^2 - b) = 0$$\nThis equation yields three solutions for the coordinates of the stationary points:\n$$q = 0$$\nand\n$$q^{2} = \\frac{b}{2a} \\implies q = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$$\n\nNext, we must distinguish between minima (stable states) and the transition state (saddle point) by examining the curvature of the potential at these stationary points. The curvature is given by the second derivative, $V''(q)$.\n$$V''(q) = \\frac{d^{2}V}{dq^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dq}(4 a q^{3} - 2 b q) = 12 a q^{2} - 2 b$$\nWe evaluate $V''(q)$ at each stationary point:\n1.  For $q=0$:\n    $$V''(0) = 12 a (0)^{2} - 2 b = -2b$$\n    Since $b > 0$, the curvature $V''(0)$ is negative. A stationary point with negative curvature along the reaction coordinate is, by definition, the transition state. Therefore, the coordinate of the transition state is $q^\\ddagger = 0$.\n\n2.  For $q = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$:\n    $$V''\\left(\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}\\right) = 12 a \\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right) - 2b = 6b - 2b = 4b$$\n    Since $b > 0$, the curvature is positive. These points correspond to the potential energy minima.\n\nHaving identified the transition state coordinate as $q^\\ddagger=0$, we now determine the characteristic frequency of motion near this point. The equation of motion for a particle of effective mass $m$ along the coordinate $q$ is given by Newton's second law:\n$$m \\frac{d^{2}q}{dt^{2}} = -\\frac{dV}{dq}$$\nNear the transition state $q^\\ddagger$, we can approximate the potential $V(q)$ using a second-order Taylor series expansion around $q^\\ddagger$:\n$$V(q) \\approx V(q^\\ddagger) + \\frac{dV}{dq}\\bigg|_{q=q^\\ddagger}(q-q^\\ddagger) + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^{2}V}{dq^{2}}\\bigg|_{q=q^\\ddagger}(q-q^\\ddagger)^{2}$$\nAt a stationary point, $\\frac{dV}{dq}\\big|_{q=q^\\ddagger} = 0$. Let $\\delta q = q - q^\\ddagger$. The potential becomes:\n$$V(q) \\approx V(q^\\ddagger) + \\frac{1}{2}V''(q^\\ddagger)(\\delta q)^{2}$$\nThe force near the transition state is then:\n$$-\\frac{dV}{dq} \\approx -V''(q^\\ddagger)(\\delta q)$$\nSubstituting this force into the equation of motion:\n$$m \\frac{d^{2}(\\delta q)}{dt^{2}} = -V''(q^\\ddagger)(\\delta q)$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}(\\delta q)}{dt^{2}} + \\left(\\frac{V''(q^\\ddagger)}{m}\\right)(\\delta q) = 0$$\nThis is the standard form of an oscillator equation, $\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + \\omega^{2}x = 0$, where the square of the angular frequency is $\\omega^{2} = \\frac{V''(q^\\ddagger)}{m}$.\nAt the transition state $q^\\ddagger=0$, we found $V''(0) = -2b$. Substituting this value:\n$$(\\omega^\\ddagger)^{2} = \\frac{-2b}{m}$$\nThe angular frequency $\\omega^\\ddagger$ is therefore imaginary, which is characteristic of an unstable mode at a saddle point, representing exponential divergence from the transition state rather than stable oscillation.\n$$\\omega^\\ddagger = \\sqrt{\\frac{-2b}{m}} = i\\sqrt{\\frac{2b}{m}}$$\nwhere $i$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe problem requires the coordinate $q^\\ddagger$ and the imaginary angular frequency $\\omega^\\ddagger$. We have found:\n$$q^\\ddagger = 0$$\n$$\\omega^\\ddagger = i\\sqrt{\\frac{2b}{m}}$$\nThe final answer is presented as a single row vector.",

To determine this sign, we inspect the trace of the Hessian, which is the sum of the eigenvalues.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{H}(P_2)) = \\frac{c^2 - 2ab}{b} + 2b = \\frac{c^2 - 2ab + 2b^2}{b}\n$$\nThe numerator consists of three positive terms ($c^2 > 0$, $-2ab > 0$, $2b^2 > 0$), so the numerator is positive. The denominator $b$ is negative. Therefore, the trace is negative:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{H}(P_2)) < 0\n$$\nSince the trace (sum of eigenvalues) is negative and the determinant (product of eigenvalues) is positive, both eigenvalues must be negative. This means $P_2$ is a local maximum (an index-$2$ stationary point).\n\nThe problem defines the transition state as an index-$1$ saddle point. Our analysis shows that only $P_1 = (0,0)$ fits this definition. Therefore, the transition state is located at the origin.\n\nThe final task is to find the reaction-coordinate curvature, which is defined as the negative eigenvalue of the Hessian at the transition state. We must find the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{H}(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2a & c \\\\ c & 2b \\end{pmatrix}$. The characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 - \\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{H})\\lambda + \\det(\\mathbf{H}) = 0$.\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - (2a+2b)\\lambda + (4ab - c^2) = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_{\\pm}$ are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{(2a+2b) \\pm \\sqrt{(2a+2b)^2 - 4(4ab - c^2)}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = (a+b) \\pm \\sqrt{(a+b)^2 - (4ab - c^2)}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = (a+b) \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - 4ab + c^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = (a+b) \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - 2ab + b^2 + c^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = (a+b) \\pm \\sqrt{(a-b)^2 + c^2}\n$$\nThe term $\\sqrt{(a-b)^2 + c^2}$ is strictly positive. To find the negative eigenvalue, we must compare the magnitude of $\\sqrt{(a-b)^2 + c^2}$ with $|a+b|$.\nNote that $(a-b)^2 > (a+b)^2$ since $(a-b)^2 - (a+b)^2 = -4ab > 0$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{(a-b)^2 + c^2} > \\sqrt{(a-b)^2} = |a-b|$.\nAlso, $\\sqrt{(a-b)^2+c^2} > \\sqrt{(a+b)^2-4ab+c^2} > \\sqrt{(a+b)^2} = |a+b|$.\nTherefore, the term $(a+b) - \\sqrt{(a-b)^2+c^2}$ is always negative. The negative eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{-} = (a+b) - \\sqrt{(a-b)^2+c^2}\n$$\nThis expression is the reaction-coordinate curvature at the transition state, as per the problem definition. It is a function of $a$, $b$, and $c$ only, which is consistent with the problem's requirement for the final answer. The parameter $d$ determined the location of the non-TS stationary point but did not affect the properties of the transition state at the origin.",
