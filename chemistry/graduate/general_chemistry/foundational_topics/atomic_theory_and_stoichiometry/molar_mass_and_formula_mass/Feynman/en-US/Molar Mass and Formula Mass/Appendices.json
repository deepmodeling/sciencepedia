            "problem": "A phosphate mineral sample is chemically identified as calcium phosphate with formula unit $\\mathrm{Ca_3(PO_4)_2}$. For an ionic solid, there is no discrete molecule; instead, a repeating lattice is characterized by a smallest electrically neutral composition, the formula unit. The formula mass (relative formula mass) of such a compound is defined by the sum, over all elements in the formula unit, of each element’s relative atomic mass multiplied by its stoichiometric coefficient. The molar mass is related to the relative formula mass by the definition of the mole and the Avogadro constant, such that numerical values coincide when the molar mass is expressed in $\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\nUsing the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) conventional relative atomic masses $A_{r}^{\\circ}(\\mathrm{Ca})=40.078$, $A_{r}^{\\circ}(\\mathrm{P})=30.973762$, and $A_{r}^{\\circ}(\\mathrm{O})=15.999$, compute the molar mass of $\\mathrm{Ca_3(PO_4)_2}$ from first principles of these definitions. Then, analyze how rounding each $A_{r}^{\\circ}$ to fewer significant figures propagates to the final value. Express the final numerical result for the molar mass in $\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, and round the reported value to six significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem presented is a straightforward application of fundamental chemical principles and definitions. It is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the calculation as requested.\n\nThe molar mass of a substance, denoted by $M$, is the mass of one mole of that substance. For an ionic compound, which exists as a crystal lattice rather than discrete molecules, we consider the formula unit. The formula unit for calcium phosphate is given as $\\mathrm{Ca_3(PO_4)_2}$.\n\nThe problem correctly states that the numerical value of the molar mass, when expressed in units of grams per mole ($\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$), is equal to the relative formula mass, $M_r$. The relative formula mass is a dimensionless quantity calculated by summing the relative atomic masses, $A_r$, of the constituent elements, each multiplied by its stoichiometric coefficient in the formula unit.\n\nFirst, we must determine the stoichiometric coefficient for each element in the formula unit $\\mathrm{Ca_3(PO_4)_2}$. The formula indicates:\n- $3$ atoms of Calcium ($\\mathrm{Ca}$)\n- $2$ phosphate groups ($\\mathrm{PO_4}$)\n\nWithin each phosphate group, there is $1$ atom of Phosphorus ($\\mathrm{P}$) and $4$ atoms of Oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}$). Therefore, the total count of atoms for each element in one formula unit is:\n- Calcium ($\\mathrm{Ca}$): $n_{\\mathrm{Ca}} = 3$\n- Phosphorus ($\\mathrm{P}$): $n_{\\mathrm{P}} = 2 \\times 1 = 2$\n- Oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}$): $n_{\\mathrm{O}} = 2 \\times 4 = 8$\n\nThe relative formula mass, $M_r(\\mathrm{Ca_3(PO_4)_2})$, is calculated according to the definition provided:\n$$M_r = n_{\\mathrm{Ca}} \\times A_r(\\mathrm{Ca}) + n_{\\mathrm{P}} \\times A_r(\\mathrm{P}) + n_{\\mathrm{O}} \\times A_r(\\mathrm{O})$$\nThe molar mass, $M$, in $\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$ has the same numerical value. We are provided with the IUPAC conventional relative atomic masses, $A_{r}^{\\circ}$:\n- $A_{r}^{\\circ}(\\mathrm{Ca}) = 40.078$\n- $A_{r}^{\\circ}(\\mathrm{P}) = 30.973762$\n- $A_{r}^{\\circ}(\\mathrm{O}) = 15.999$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the molar mass:\n$$M(\\mathrm{Ca_3(PO_4)_2}) = (3 \\times 40.078) + (2 \\times 30.973762) + (8 \\times 15.999)$$\nWe perform the calculation for each term:\n- Contribution from Calcium: $3 \\times 40.078 = 120.234$\n- Contribution from Phosphorus: $2 \\times 30.973762 = 61.947524$\n- Contribution from Oxygen: $8 \\times 15.999 = 127.992$\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total molar mass:\n$$M = 120.234 + 61.947524 + 127.992 = 310.173524~\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of how rounding the initial atomic masses propagates error. Let us consider the calculation using typical textbook values, which are often rounded. For example, rounding to four significant figures or two decimal places:\n- $A_r(\\mathrm{Ca}) \\approx 40.08$\n- $A_r(\\mathrm{P}) \\approx 30.97$\n- $A_r(\\mathrm{O}) \\approx 16.00$\n\nRecalculating with these rounded values gives a new molar mass, $M'$:\n$$M' = (3 \\times 40.08) + (2 \\times 30.97) + (8 \\times 16.00)$$\n$$M' = 120.24 + 61.94 + 128.00 = 310.18~\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nComparing this result to the more precise value, we find a discrepancy:\n$$\\Delta M = |M' - M| = |310.18 - 310.173524| = 0.006476~\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nThis demonstrates a fundamental principle of scientific measurement and calculation: premature rounding of intermediate values or constants degrades the precision of the final result. The use of high-precision IUPAC values is necessary for accurate work, and rounding should only be performed at the final step, according to the desired precision of the outcome.\n\nThe problem demands the final numerical result to be rounded to six significant figures. Our calculated value is $310.173524$. The first six significant figures are $3$, $1$, $0$, $1$, $7$, and $3$. The seventh figure is $5$, which requires rounding up the preceding digit.\nTherefore, the value rounded to six significant figures is $310.174$.",

It is free from subjectivity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a formalizable and solvable problem in quantitative chemistry.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe molar mass, $M$, of the compound $\\mathrm{Li_2B_4O_7}$ is defined as the stoichiometry-weighted sum of the atomic masses, $A_r$, of its constituent elements. The chemical formula indicates stoichiometric coefficients of $2$ for lithium ($\\mathrm{Li}$), $4$ for boron ($\\mathrm{B}$), and $7$ for oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}$). The governing equation is:\n$$M(A_r(\\mathrm{Li}), A_r(\\mathrm{B}), A_r(\\mathrm{O})) = 2 \\cdot A_r(\\mathrm{Li}) + 4 \\cdot A_r(\\mathrm{B}) + 7 \\cdot A_r(\\mathrm{O})$$\nThe atomic masses of the elements are not single values but are given as intervals due to natural isotopic variation. Let the intervals be $I_{\\mathrm{Li}} = [6.938,\\,6.997]$, $I_{\\mathrm{B}} = [10.806,\\,10.821]$, and $I_{\\mathrm{O}} = [15.99903,\\,15.99977]$.\n\n**Task 1: Determine the molar mass interval $[M_{\\min},\\,M_{\\max}]$**\n\nThe function $M$ is a linear combination of the atomic masses with strictly positive coefficients ($2$, $4$, $7$). Therefore, to find the minimum possible value of the molar mass, $M_{\\min}$, one must use the minimum value of each atomic mass from its respective interval.\n$$M_{\\min} = 2 \\cdot A_{r, \\min}(\\mathrm{Li}) + 4 \\cdot A_{r, \\min}(\\mathrm{B}) + 7 \\cdot A_{r, \\min}(\\mathrm{O})$$\nSubstituting the given lower bounds:\n$$M_{\\min} = 2 \\cdot (6.938) + 4 \\cdot (10.806) + 7 \\cdot (15.99903)$$\n$$M_{\\min} = 13.876 + 43.224 + 111.99321$$\n$$M_{\\min} = 169.09321~\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\nConversely, to find the maximum possible value of the molar mass, $M_{\\max}$, one must use the maximum value of each atomic mass from its respective interval.\n$$M_{\\max} = 2 \\cdot A_{r, \\max}(\\mathrm{Li}) + 4 \\cdot A_{r, \\max}(\\mathrm{B}) + 7 \\cdot A_{r, \\max}(\\mathrm{O})$$\nSubstituting the given upper bounds:\n$$M_{\\max} = 2 \\cdot (6.997) + 4 \\cdot (10.821) + 7 \\cdot (15.99977)$$\n$$M_{\\max} = 13.994 + 43.284 + 111.99839$$\n$$M_{\\max} = 169.27639~\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nThus, the attainable molar mass interval for $\\mathrm{Li_2B_4O_7}$ is $[169.09321, 169.27639]$.\n\n**Task 2: Determine the optimal single-number value $M^{\\ast}$**\n\nThe problem requires selecting a single value $M^{\\ast}$ that minimizes the maximum absolute deviation from any possible molar mass $M$ in the interval $[M_{\\min},\\,M_{\\max}]$. This is formally stated as finding $M^{\\ast}$ that solves the minimax problem:\n$$\\min_{M^{\\ast}} \\left( \\max_{M \\in [M_{\\min}, M_{\\max}]} |M - M^{\\ast}| \\right)$$\nThe principle for solving this is to choose the center of the interval. For any interval $[a, b]$, the value $x^{\\ast}$ that minimizes $\\max_{x \\in [a, b]} |x - x^{\\ast}|$ is the midpoint $x^{\\ast} = (a+b)/2$. The maximum deviation is then half the width of the interval, $(b-a)/2$. Any other choice for $x^{\\ast}$ would result in a larger maximum deviation from one of the endpoints.\n\nApplying this principle, the optimal value $M^{\\ast}$ is the arithmetic mean of $M_{\\min}$ and $M_{\\max}$:\n$$M^{\\ast} = \\frac{M_{\\min} + M_{\\max}}{2}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$M^{\\ast} = \\frac{169.09321 + 169.27639}{2} = \\frac{338.3696}{2}$$\n$$M^{\\ast} = 169.1848~\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\n**Task 3: Round the value and discuss uncertainty**\n\nThe calculated value $M^{\\ast} = 169.1848$ must be rounded to five significant figures as requested. The first five significant figures are $1$, $6$, $9$, $1$, and $8$. The subsequent digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nThe rounded value is $169.18$.\n\nFor the purposes of rigorous quantitative analysis, reporting only a single value is incomplete. The uncertainty associated with using this single value must be communicated. The uncertainty $U$ is the maximum deviation, which is half the width of the interval:\n$$U = \\frac{M_{\\max} - M_{\\min}}{2} = \\frac{169.27639 - 169.09321}{2} = \\frac{0.18318}{2} = 0.09159$$\nTherefore, in a laboratory report, the molar mass should be stated as $M = 169.1848 \\pm 0.09159~\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$. This uncertainty contribution must be propagated into the uncertainty budget of any final analytical result derived using this molar mass.\n\nHowever, the question asks only for the rounded single-number value $M^{\\ast}$ as the final answer.\nFinal value: $M^{\\ast}_{\\text{rounded}} = 169.18$.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It presents a standard chemical analysis task based on fundamental principles of mass spectrometry and isotopic abundance. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of physical law. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part analysis for the proposed molecular formula $\\mathrm{C_{10}H_{14}N_2O}$. The analysis proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, the theoretical intensity ratios of the isotopic peaks, $R_k = I(M+k)/I(M)$, are derived from first principles. The intensity of any mass spectral peak is proportional to the probability of occurrence of the corresponding isotopologues. The $M$ peak corresponds to the molecule containing only the most abundant isotopes ($^{12}\\mathrm{C}$, $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$, $^{16}\\mathrm{O}$). Its probability, $P(M)$, serves as the reference.\nLet the molecular formula be $\\mathrm{C}_{n_C}\\mathrm{H}_{n_H}\\mathrm{N}_{n_N}\\mathrm{O}_{n_O}$, where $n_C=10$, $n_H=14$, $n_N=2$, and $n_O=1$. Let $p_i$ denote the natural abundance (mole fraction) of an isotope $i$. The probability of the monoisotopic species is $P(M) = (p_{^{12}C})^{n_C}(p_{^{1}H})^{n_H}(p_{^{14}N})^{n_N}(p_{^{16}O})^{n_O}$.\n\nThe $M+1$ peak arises from the incorporation of a single nucleus with a mass number increase of one: $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$, $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$, or $^{17}\\mathrm{O}$. The total probability $P(M+1)$ is the sum of probabilities for each of these mutually exclusive events. For example, the probability of having exactly one $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atom and all other atoms being the most abundant is given by the binomial distribution: $\\binom{n_C}{1} p_{^{13}C} (p_{^{12}C})^{n_C-1} \\times (p_{^{1}H})^{n_H}(p_{^{14}N})^{n_N}(p_{^{16}O})^{n_O}$. The ratio of this probability to $P(M)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\binom{n_C}{1} p_{^{13}C} (p_{^{12}C})^{n_C-1} (p_{^{1}H})^{n_H} (p_{^{14}N})^{n_N} (p_{^{16}O})^{n_O}}{(p_{^{12}C})^{n_C}(p_{^{1}H})^{n_H}(p_{^{14}N})^{n_N}(p_{^{16}O})^{n_O}} = n_C \\frac{p_{^{13}C}}{p_{^{12}C}} = n_C \\frac{p_{^{13}C}}{1-p_{^{13}C}} $$\nThe total theoretical ratio for the $M+1$ peak, $R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{1}$, is the sum of such terms for all possible $+1$ isotopic substitutions. For oxygen, which has three stable isotopes ($^{16}\\mathrm{O}$, $^{17}\\mathrm{O}$, $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$), the abundance of the lightest isotope is $p_{^{16}O} = 1 - p_{^{17}O} - p_{^{18}O}$.\n$$ R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{1} = \\frac{I(M+1)}{I(M)} \\approx \\frac{P(M+1)}{P(M)} = \\frac{n_C p_{^{13}C}}{1-p_{^{13}C}} + \\frac{n_H p_{^{2}H}}{1-p_{^{2}H}} + \\frac{n_N p_{^{15}N}}{1-p_{^{15}N}} + \\frac{n_O p_{^{17}O}}{1-p_{^{17}O}-p_{^{18}O}} $$\n\nThe $M+2$ peak arises from two types of events: ($1$) a single substitution of a $+2$ isotope ($^{18}\\mathrm{O}$), and ($2$) two separate substitutions of $+1$ isotopes. The total ratio $R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{2}$ is the sum of probabilities for these events, divided by $P(M)$.\nThe contribution from a single $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ is analogous to the $M+1$ terms:\n$$ R_{M+2}(^{18}\\mathrm{O}) = \\frac{n_O p_{^{18}O}}{1-p_{^{17}O}-p_{^{18}O}} $$\nThe contribution from two $+1$ substitutions is a sum over all pairs of substitutions. For two substitutions on the same element (e.g., two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms), the ratio term is $\\binom{n_C}{2} (\\frac{p_{^{13}C}}{1-p_{^{13}C}})^2$. For substitutions on different elements (e.g., one $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ and one $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$), the term is $(n_C \\frac{p_{^{13}C}}{1-p_{^{13}C}})(n_H \\frac{p_{^{2}H}}{1-p_{^{2}H}})$. Summing all such combinations, the total contribution from two $+1$ substitutions simplifies to a compact expression. Let $r_i = \\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}$ for a given $+1$ isotope. The sum of all pairwise products is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{2}\\left( (\\sum n_i r_i)^2 - \\sum (n_i r_i)^2 \\right) + \\sum \\binom{n_i}{2}r_i^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{1})^2 - \\sum n_i r_i^2 \\right)$. Thus, the full expression for the $M+2$ ratio is:\n$$ R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{2} = \\frac{I(M+2)}{I(M)} \\approx \\frac{n_O p_{^{18}O}}{1-p_{^{17}O}-p_{^{18}O}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{1}\\right)^2 - \\sum_{i \\in \\{^{13}\\mathrm{C}, ^{2}\\mathrm{H}, ^{15}\\mathrm{N}, ^{17}\\mathrm{O}\\}} n_i \\left( \\frac{p_i}{1-p_i'} \\right)^2 \\right] $$\nwhere $p_i$ is the abundance of the $+1$ isotope and $1-p_i'$ is the abundance of the corresponding lightest isotope.\n\nSecond, these expressions are evaluated numerically using the provided data: $n_C=10, n_H=14, n_N=2, n_O=1$, and abundances $p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}=0.01070$, $p_{^{2}\\mathrm{H}}=0.000155$, $p_{^{15}\\mathrm{N}}=0.00364$, $p_{^{17}\\mathrm{O}}=0.00038$, $p_{^{18}\\mathrm{O}}=0.00205$.\nThe denominators for the ratios are $1-p_{^{13}C} = 0.98930$, $1-p_{^{2}H} = 0.999845$, $1-p_{^{15}N} = 0.99636$, and $1-p_{^{17}O}-p_{^{18}O} = 0.99757$.\nThe individual ratio terms for $R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{1}$ are:\n- Carbon: $10 \\times \\frac{0.01070}{0.98930} \\approx 0.108157$\n- Hydrogen: $14 \\times \\frac{0.000155}{0.999845} \\approx 0.002170$\n- Nitrogen: $2 \\times \\frac{0.00364}{0.99636} \\approx 0.007307$\n- Oxygen ($^{17}\\mathrm{O}$): $1 \\times \\frac{0.00038}{0.99757} \\approx 0.000381$\nSumming these yields $R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{1} = 0.108157 + 0.002170 + 0.007307 + 0.000381 = 0.118015$.\n\nFor $R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{2}$, the term for single $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ substitution is $1 \\times \\frac{0.00205}{0.99757} \\approx 0.002055$.\nThe correction term requires $\\sum n_i r_i^2$:\n- Carbon: $10 \\times (\\frac{0.01070}{0.98930})^2 \\approx 0.0011698$\n- Hydrogen: $14 \\times (\\frac{0.000155}{0.999845})^2 \\approx 3.36 \\times 10^{-7}$\n- Nitrogen: $2 \\times (\\frac{0.00364}{0.99636})^2 \\approx 2.67 \\times 10^{-5}$\n- Oxygen ($^{17}\\mathrm{O}$): $1 \\times (\\frac{0.00038}{0.99757})^2 \\approx 1.45 \\times 10^{-7}$\nThe sum is $\\approx 0.001197$.\n$$ R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{2} \\approx 0.002055 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (0.118015)^2 - 0.001197 \\right] = 0.002055 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 0.0139275 - 0.001197 \\right] = 0.002055 + 0.006365 = 0.008420 $$\nSo, the calculated ratios are $R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{1} = 0.118015$ and $R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{2} = 0.008420$.\n\nThird, the calculated ratios are compared to the observed ratios, $R^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{1}=0.1178$ and $R^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{2}=0.00840$, using the root-mean-square fractional deviation (RMSFD).\n$$ \\mathrm{RMSFD} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k\\in\\{1,2\\}}\\left(\\frac{R^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{k}-R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{k}}{R^{\\mathrm{calc}}_{k}}\\right)^{2}} $$\nThe fractional deviations are:\n- For $k=1$: $\\frac{0.1178 - 0.118015}{0.118015} \\approx -0.00182$\n- For $k=2$: $\\frac{0.00840 - 0.008420}{0.008420} \\approx -0.00237$\nPlugging these into the RMSFD formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{RMSFD} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left( (-0.00182)^2 + (-0.00237)^2 \\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left( 3.31 \\times 10^{-6} + 5.62 \\times 10^{-6} \\right)} = \\sqrt{4.465 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 0.00211 $$\nSince $\\mathrm{RMSFD} \\approx 0.00211 < 0.02$, the observed isotopic envelope is highly consistent with the proposed formula $\\mathrm{C_{10}H_{14}N_2O}$.\n\nFourth, the average molar mass of $\\mathrm{C_{10}H_{14}N_2O}$ is calculated from the given average atomic weights: $A_r(\\mathrm{C}) = 12.011$, $A_r(\\mathrm{H}) = 1.00794$, $A_r(\\mathrm{N}) = 14.0067$, and $A_r(\\mathrm{O}) = 15.9994$.\nThe molar mass $M$ is the sum of the average atomic masses of the constituent elements, multiplied by their counts in the molecular formula.\n$$ M = 10 \\cdot A_r(\\mathrm{C}) + 14 \\cdot A_r(\\mathrm{H}) + 2 \\cdot A_r(\\mathrm{N}) + 1 \\cdot A_r(\\mathrm{O}) $$\n$$ M = 10 \\cdot (12.011) + 14 \\cdot (1.00794) + 2 \\cdot (14.0067) + 1 \\cdot (15.9994) $$\n$$ M = 120.11 + 14.11116 + 28.0134 + 15.9994 $$\n$$ M = 178.23396~\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nRounding to $6$ significant figures as requested, the final answer for the average molar mass is $178.234~\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$.",
