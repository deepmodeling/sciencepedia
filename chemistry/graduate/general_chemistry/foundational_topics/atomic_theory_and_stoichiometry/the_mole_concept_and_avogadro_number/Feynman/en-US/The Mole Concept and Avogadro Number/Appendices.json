This first practice challenges you to apply this modern definition directly, reinforcing the link between the macroscopic 'mole' and the microscopic count of entities. By considering the propagation of uncertainty, you will explore the profound metrological shift this redefinition represents for chemical measurement .",

            "problem": "In $2019$, the International System of Units (SI) was redefined so that one mole is the amount of substance containing exactly $N_A$ specified elementary entities, where $N_A$ (the Avogadro constant) is defined to be exactly $6.02214076\\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. Relying only on this definitional base and the core definition of amount of substance, determine the number of molecules present in $2.50\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol}$ of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$. Round your answer to three significant figures, and express the final result as a pure count of molecules (no units). In addition, briefly discuss, within your reasoning, the significance of the exactness of the conversion factor for how uncertainty propagates from amount of substance to entity counts.",
            "solution": "The fundamental base is the definition of the mole in the redefined International System of Units (SI): one mole contains exactly $N_A$ elementary entities, with $N_A=6.02214076\\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ by definition. Let $n$ denote the amount of substance in moles and $N$ the number of discrete entities (here, molecules of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$). By the definition, exactly one mole corresponds to exactly $N_A$ entities. Because amount of substance is extensive and scales linearly with the number of entities, $n$ moles correspond to\n$$\nN \\;=\\; n\\,N_A.\n$$\nThis relation is not an empirical shortcut but a direct consequence of the definitional identification that $1\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\leftrightarrow N_A$ entities and the linear scaling of counts with sample size.\n\nGiven $n=2.50\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol}$ and $N_A=6.02214076\\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ (exact), we compute\n$$\nN \\;=\\; \\left(2.50\\times 10^{-9}\\right)\\left(6.02214076\\times 10^{23}\\right)\n\\;=\\; 15.0553519\\times 10^{14}\n\\;=\\; 1.50553519\\times 10^{15}.\n$$\nBecause $N_A$ is exact, the only limitation on the reported significant figures comes from the stated precision of $n$. The given $n=2.50\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol}$ has three significant figures, so the appropriate report for $N$ is to three significant figures:\n$$\nN \\;\\approx\\; 1.51\\times 10^{15}.\n$$\n\nSignificance of exactness: Prior to the $2019$ redefinition, the numerical value of $N_A$ carried a measured uncertainty, so converting between $n$ and $N$ propagated both the measurement uncertainty in $n$ and the constant’s uncertainty. After the redefinition, $N_A$ is an exact constant that defines the mole, so the conversion factor $N_A$ introduces no additional uncertainty. All uncertainty in $N$ arises solely from the uncertainty in $n$. Physically, $N$ must be an integer, but when $n$ is given with finite precision, $N$ is reported as a rounded real-number estimate consistent with the uncertainty in $n$; the exactness of $N_A$ ensures that no further uncertainty is added by the conversion itself.",

This exercise is a thought experiment that explores a hypothetical scenario where the mole is defined not by carbon-12, but by silicon-28 . By working through the consequences of this alternative standard, you will develop a deeper, more flexible understanding of the relationship between atomic mass units, mass, and the mole itself, moving beyond rote application of the familiar rules.",

            "problem": "In the system of units prior to the 2019 SI redefinition, the molar mass of carbon-12 was exactly 12 g/mol by definition, and the atomic mass unit (u) was defined as 1/12th of the mass of a single carbon-12 atom. This established a direct numerical correspondence where a substance with an atomic or molecular mass of $X$ u had a molar mass of $X$ g/mol.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical alternate reality where the scientific community chose a different reference standard.

            "introduction": "The power of the mole concept extends beyond simply quantifying static amounts of substance; it is the cornerstone for describing dynamic chemical change. This problem introduces the 'extent of reaction' ($\\xi$), an elegant and powerful variable that unifies the stoichiometric changes of all reactants and products into a single parameter . Deriving the relationships between the amount of each species and $\\xi$ provides a foundational skill for the study of chemical equilibrium and kinetics.",

            "problem": "A closed, well-mixed batch system at fixed temperature and pressure contains chemical species $\\mathrm{A}$, $\\mathrm{B}$, and $\\mathrm{C}$ that undergo the single, elementary stoichiometric transformation $\\mathrm{A} + 2\\,\\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}$ with no side reactions. Let $n_{\\mathrm{A},0}$, $n_{\\mathrm{B},0}$, and $n_{\\mathrm{C},0}$ denote the initial amounts of substance (in moles) of $\\mathrm{A}$, $\\mathrm{B}$, and $\\mathrm{C}$, respectively. Define the extent of reaction $\\xi$ as a scalar measure of advancement that is common to all species in this reaction.

            "solution": "The stoichiometric transformation is given as $\\mathrm{A} + 2\\,\\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}$. This relationship can be written in a general algebraic form $\\sum_{i} \\nu_i \\mathrm{X}_i = 0$, where $\\mathrm{X}_i$ represents the chemical species and $\\nu_i$ are the stoichiometric numbers. By convention, reactants are assigned negative stoichiometric numbers and products are assigned positive ones. For the given reaction, we have:\n- For species $\\mathrm{A}$: $\\nu_{\\mathrm{A}} = -1$\n- For species $\\mathrm{B}$: $\\nu_{\\mathrm{B}} = -2$\n- For species $\\mathrm{C}$: $\\nu_{\\mathrm{C}} = +1$\n\nThe extent of reaction, $\\xi$, is defined to quantify the progress of a chemical reaction. It has units of moles. The change in the amount of substance (in moles) of any species $i$, denoted $dn_i$, is related to the change in the extent of reaction, $d\\xi$, through its stoichiometric number, $\\nu_i$. This relationship formalizes the principle of conservation of atoms, as it ensures that all species are consumed or produced in fixed stoichiometric proportions. The definition is:\n$$d\\xi = \\frac{dn_i}{\\nu_i}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the change in the amount of each species:\n$$dn_i = \\nu_i d\\xi$$\nTo find the amount of substance $n_i$ at any extent of reaction $\\xi$, we integrate this differential equation from the initial state (where $\\xi = 0$ and the amount of substance is $n_{i,0}$) to a subsequent state (with extent $\\xi$ and amount $n_i(\\xi)$):\n$$\\int_{n_{i,0}}^{n_i(\\xi)} dn_i = \\int_0^{\\xi} \\nu_i d\\xi$$\nSince the stoichiometric number $\\nu_i$ is a constant for a given reaction, the integration is straightforward:\n$$n_i(\\xi) - n_{i,0} = \\nu_i (\\xi - 0)$$\nThis gives the general equation for the amount of any species $i$ as a function of the extent of reaction:\n$$n_i(\\xi) = n_{i,0} + \\nu_i \\xi$$\nWe now apply this general formula to each species in the reaction $\\mathrm{A} + 2\\,\\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}$ using their respective initial amounts and stoichiometric numbers.\n\nFor species $\\mathrm{A}$, with initial amount $n_{\\mathrm{A},0}$ and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{A}} = -1$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{A}}(\\xi) = n_{\\mathrm{A},0} + (-1)\\xi = n_{\\mathrm{A},0} - \\xi$$\nFor species $\\mathrm{B}$, with initial amount $n_{\\mathrm{B},0}$ and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{B}} = -2$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\xi) = n_{\\mathrm{B},0} + (-2)\\xi = n_{\\mathrm{B},0} - 2\\xi$$\nFor species $\\mathrm{C}$, with initial amount $n_{\\mathrm{C},0}$ and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{C}} = +1$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{C}}(\\xi) = n_{\\mathrm{C},0} + (+1)\\xi = n_{\\mathrm{C},0} + \\xi$$\nThese three expressions represent the amount of substance for each species as a function of the extent of reaction.\n\nThe physical interpretation of the signs of the stoichiometric numbers is rooted in the link between the macroscopic description (moles) and the microscopic reality (discrete entities like molecules). The amount of substance, $n_i$, is related to the number of entities, $N_i$, by the Avogadro constant, $N_A$: $n_i = N_i / N_A$.\nThe change in the number of entities $\\Delta N_i$ for a reaction advancement of $\\xi$ moles is:\n$$\\Delta N_i = \\Delta n_i \\times N_A = (n_i(\\xi) - n_{i,0}) \\times N_A$$\nSubstituting the derived relations, we get:\n$$\\Delta N_i = (\\nu_i \\xi) \\times N_A$$\nThe quantity $\\xi$ is the number of moles of reaction events. Therefore, the product $\\xi N_A$ represents the total number of elementary reaction events that have occurred. For each single, elementary reaction event ($\\mathrm{A} + 2\\,\\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}$), the number of molecules of $\\mathrm{A}$ decreases by $1$, the number of molecules of $\\mathrm{B}$ decreases by $2$, and the number of molecules of $\\mathrm{C}$ increases by $1$.\nThus, the stoichiometric number $\\nu_i$ is precisely the change in the number of entities of species $i$ per single reaction event.\n- A negative sign ($\\nu_{\\mathrm{A}} = -1$, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{B}} = -2$) signifies that the species is a reactant and is consumed. The number of entities of that species decreases as the reaction proceeds in the forward direction ($\\xi > 0$).\n- A positive sign ($\\nu_{\\mathrm{C}} = +1$) signifies that the species is a product and is formed. The number of entities of that species increases as the reaction proceeds.\nThe Avogadro constant $N_A$ serves as the fundamental bridge, ensuring that the macroscopic changes in moles described by the extent of reaction $\\xi$ are consistent with the microscopic changes in the number of molecules dictated by the stoichiometry of a single reaction event.",
