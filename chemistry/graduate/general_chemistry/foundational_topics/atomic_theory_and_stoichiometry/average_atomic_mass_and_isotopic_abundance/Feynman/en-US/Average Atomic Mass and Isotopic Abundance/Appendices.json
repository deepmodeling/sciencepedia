It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary data for a unique solution. The task is to construct a quantitative counterexample to the misconception that average atomic mass is the simple arithmetic mean of isotope mass numbers. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe physically correct average atomic mass, $\\bar{m}$, of an element is the weighted average of the exact masses of its naturally occurring isotopes. The weight for each isotope is its fractional abundance. This is an application of the concept of an expectation value for a discrete probability distribution. For an element with $N$ isotopes, where the $i$-th isotope has an exact mass $m_i$ and a fractional abundance $x_i$, the average atomic mass is given by the formula:\n$$ \\bar{m} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i m_i $$\nThe problem provides data for the $N=3$ stable isotopes of magnesium ($^{24}\\mathrm{Mg}$, $^{25}\\mathrm{Mg}$, and $^{26}\\mathrm{Mg}$).\nThe givens are:\nFor $^{24}\\mathrm{Mg}$: $x_{24} = 0.7899$, $m_{24} = 23.9850417$ u.\nFor $^{25}\\mathrm{Mg}$: $x_{25} = 0.1000$, $m_{25} = 24.98583692$ u.\nFor $^{26}\\mathrm{Mg}$: $x_{26} = 0.1101$, $m_{26} = 25.98259297$ u.\n\nFirst, we calculate the correct average atomic mass of magnesium, which we will denote $\\bar{m}_{\\text{Mg}}$.\n$$ \\bar{m}_{\\text{Mg}} = x_{24} m_{24} + x_{25} m_{25} + x_{26} m_{26} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\bar{m}_{\\text{Mg}} = (0.7899 \\times 23.9850417) + (0.1000 \\times 24.98583692) + (0.1101 \\times 25.98259297) $$\nPerforming the multiplication for each term:\n$$ \\text{Contribution from } ^{24}\\mathrm{Mg} = 18.94578443883 \\text{ u} $$\n$$ \\text{Contribution from } ^{25}\\mathrm{Mg} = 2.498583692 \\text{ u} $$\n$$ \\text{Contribution from } ^{26}\\mathrm{Mg} = 2.860683485997 \\text{ u} $$\nSumming these contributions gives the true average atomic mass:\n$$ \\bar{m}_{\\text{Mg}} = 18.94578443883 + 2.498583692 + 2.860683485997 = 24.305051616827 \\text{ u} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the value based on the stated misconception. The misconception is that the average atomic mass is the simple arithmetic mean of the integer mass numbers of the isotopes. Let us denote this erroneous quantity as $\\bar{A}_{\\text{erroneous}}$.

This error arises from two fundamental misunderstandings: ($1$) confusing the integer mass number (a count of nucleons) with the precise, non-integer isotopic mass (which includes effects of nuclear binding energy and the masses of electrons), and ($2$) using a simple (unweighted) arithmetic mean, which implicitly and incorrectly assumes the isotopes are present in equal abundances (i.e., $x_i = 1/3$ for all $i$).\n\nFinally, the problem requires the absolute value of the difference, $\\Delta$, between the physically meaningful average atomic mass and the erroneous value.\n$$ \\Delta = |\\bar{m}_{\\text{Mg}} - \\bar{A}_{\\text{erroneous}}| $$\n$$ \\Delta = |24.305051616827 - 25| $$\n$$ \\Delta = |-0.694948383173| $$\n$$ \\Delta = 0.694948383173 \\text{ u} $$\n\nThe problem specifies that this final result must be rounded to five significant figures. The first five significant figures of the number $0.69494838...$ are $6, 9, 4, 9, 4$. The sixth significant digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we must round up the fifth digit. The fifth digit, $4$, is rounded up to $5$.\nTherefore, the rounded difference is $0.69495$.",

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with sufficient and consistent data for a unique solution.

The general formula is:\n$$m_{avg} = \\sum_{i} a_i m_i$$\n\nFor the natural silicon sample with isotopes $^{28}\\mathrm{Si}$, $^{29}\\mathrm{Si}$, and $^{30}\\mathrm{Si}$, the average atomic mass, which we denote as $m_{nat}$, is given by:\n$$m_{nat} = a_{28} m_{28} + a_{29} m_{29} + a_{30} m_{30}$$\nHere, $a_{28}$, $a_{29}$, and $a_{30}$ are the natural fractional abundances, and $m_{28}$, $m_{29}$, and $m_{30}$ are the exact isotopic masses. The sum of the abundances is normalized to unity: $a_{28} + a_{29} + a_{30} = 1$.\n\nFor the enriched sample, the isotopic masses remain unchanged. However, the fractional abundances are altered. Let us denote the new abundances by $a'_{28}$, $a'_{29}$, and $a'_{30}$. According to the problem statement:\n- The abundance of $^{28}\\mathrm{Si}$ is unchanged: $a'_{28} = a_{28}$.\n- The abundance of $^{29}\\mathrm{Si}$ is reduced by an amount $\\delta$: $a'_{29} = a_{29} - \\delta$.\n- The abundance of $^{30}\\mathrm{Si}$ is increased by the same amount $\\delta$: $a'_{30} = a_{30} + \\delta$.\n\nThe normalization condition for the new abundances is maintained:\n$$a'_{28} + a'_{29} + a'_{30} = a_{28} + (a_{29} - \\delta) + (a_{30} + \\delta) = a_{28} + a_{29} + a_{30} = 1$$\n\nThe average atomic mass of the enriched sample, denoted as $m_{enr}$, is:\n$$m_{enr} = a'_{28} m_{28} + a'_{29} m_{29} + a'_{30} m_{30}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the new abundances, we obtain:\n$$m_{enr} = a_{28} m_{28} + (a_{29} - \\delta) m_{29} + (a_{30} + \\delta) m_{30}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the change in average atomic mass, $\\Delta m$, defined as the mass of the enriched sample minus the mass of the natural sample:\n$$\\Delta m = m_{enr} - m_{nat}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $m_{enr}$ and $m_{nat}$:\n$$\\Delta m = [a_{28} m_{28} + (a_{29} - \\delta) m_{29} + (a_{30} + \\delta) m_{30}] - [a_{28} m_{28} + a_{29} m_{29} + a_{30} m_{30}]$$\nWe expand the terms and regroup:\n$$\\Delta m = (a_{28} m_{28} - a_{28} m_{28}) + (a_{29} m_{29} - \\delta m_{29} - a_{29} m_{29}) + (a_{30} m_{30} + \\delta m_{30} - a_{30} m_{30})$$\nThe terms corresponding to the natural abundances cancel out, leaving only the terms involving $\\delta$:\n$$\\Delta m = -\\delta m_{29} + \\delta m_{30}$$\nFactoring out $\\delta$, we arrive at the final derived expression for the change in average atomic mass:\n$$\\Delta m = \\delta (m_{30} - m_{29})$$\nThis expression is derived from first principles as required.

Consider a well-mixed macroscopic sample of $E$ formed exclusively by two isotopes of exact (in the sense of the unified atomic mass scale) masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$.

            "solution": "The starting point is the following set of foundational definitions and facts:\n\n- Isotopic abundance as a mole fraction: if a sample contains amounts of substance (in moles) $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ of isotopes with exact atomic masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, then the mole fractions are $x_{1} = \\dfrac{n_{1}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}$ and $x_{2} = \\dfrac{n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}$, with $x_{1}+x_{2}=1$.\n\n- Additivity of mass in mixtures: for a collection of noninteracting particles, the total mass is the sum of the individual masses.\n\n- The standard relative atomic mass $A_{r}(E)$ is the ratio of the mean atomic mass of element $E$ in the given sample to one twelfth of the mass of a ground-state $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atom.

Let the sample contain $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ atoms of $E$, with fractions $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ belonging to isotopes of masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, respectively.

Let $u = (1,\\dots,1)^{\\top}$ and $m = (m_{1},\\dots,m_{N})^{\\top}$. The constraint matrix with rows $u^{\\top}$ and $m^{\\top}$ has rank $2$ provided $u$ and $m$ are linearly independent, which is the generic case when not all $m_{i}$ are equal. Therefore, generically, the solution set is an affine subspace of dimension $N - 2$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{S} \\;=\\; \\left\\{\\, x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N} \\;:\\; u^{\\top} x = 1,\\; m^{\\top} x = A_{r}(E) \\,\\right\\},\n\\qquad\n\\dim(\\mathcal{S}) = N - 2.\n$$\nImposing the additional physical constraints $x_{i} \\geq 0$ restricts $\\mathcal{S}$ to a convex polytope (a slice of the simplex), but does not change the generic non-uniqueness. Hence, from a single scalar average $A_{r}(E)$ and normalization alone, $(x_{1},\\dots,x_{N})$ is not uniquely identifiable unless $N = 2$.\n\nTo restore identifiability in principle for $N \\geq 3$, one must supply $N - 2$ additional independent scalar measurements that provide linearly independent constraints on $x$. For example, if one can measure mixture-averaged values of $N - 2$ additional isotope-weighted properties yielding linear forms $p^{(k)\\top} x = P_{k}$, $k = 1,\\dots,N-2$, with the vectors $u$, $m$, and $p^{(1)},\\dots,p^{(N-2)}$ linearly independent, then the full $N \\times N$ system is generically invertible and the abundances are uniquely determined (subject to physical feasibility $x_{i} \\geq 0$). A canonical parametrization of the underdetermined case is obtained by selecting $N - 2$ indices as free parameters $t_{j} = x_{j}$ and solving the two linear equations for the remaining two $x_{i}$ in terms of the $t_{j}$, with feasibility further restricting the allowable range of the $t_{j}$.",
