            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in dimensional analysis within the context of general chemistry. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is free of contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to convert a given mass concentration, $C_{mass} = 5.0\\ \\text{mg L}^{-1}$, into an amount concentration, $C_{amount}$, expressed in the coherent SI base unit form of $\\text{mol m}^{-3}$. This conversion will be performed in terms of the solute's molar mass, $M$, which is given in units of $\\text{g mol}^{-1}$. The derivation will rely exclusively on dimensional analysis, applying a series of conversion factors derived from fundamental definitions.\n\nThe initial concentration is given as:\n$$\nC_{mass} = 5.0\\ \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}}\n$$\nWe must convert the mass unit in the numerator from milligrams ($\\text{mg}$) to amount of substance in moles ($\\text{mol}$), and the volume unit in the denominator from liters ($\\text{L}$) to cubic meters ($\\text{m}^3$). This can be accomplished by multiplying the initial value by a chain of conversion factors, each of which is equivalent to the number $1$.\n\nThe required conversion factors are as follows:\n\n1.  **Mass Conversion from Milligrams to Grams**: The SI prefix 'milli-' (m) represents a factor of $10^{-3}$. The relationship between milligrams and grams is therefore $1 \\text{ mg} = 10^{-3} \\text{ g}$. To convert from milligrams, we construct the conversion factor:\n    $$\n    \\frac{10^{-3} \\text{ g}}{1 \\text{ mg}} = 1\n    $$\n\n2.  **Conversion from Mass to Amount of Substance**: The amount of substance, $n$ (in $\\text{mol}$), is related to its mass, $m$ (in $\\text{g}$), and its molar mass, $M$ (in $\\text{g mol}^{-1}$), by the fundamental equation $n = \\frac{m}{M}$. This provides a substance-specific conversion factor between mass and moles:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1 \\text{ mol}}{M \\text{ g}} = 1\n    $$\n\n3.  **Volume Conversion from Liters to Cubic Meters**: The liter ($\\text{L}$) is a non-SI unit for volume, defined as $1 \\text{ L} = 1 \\text{ dm}^3$. The SI prefix 'deci-' (d) represents a factor of $10^{-1}$, so $1 \\text{ dm} = 10^{-1} \\text{ m}$. The relationship between liters and cubic meters is therefore:\n    $$\n    1 \\text{ L} = (1 \\text{ dm})^3 = (10^{-1} \\text{ m})^3 = 10^{-3} \\text{ m}^3\n    $$\n    Since the liter unit is in the denominator of the concentration expression, we need the reciprocal conversion factor, which is also equal to $1$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{10^{-3} \\text{ m}^3} = 1\n    $$\n\nNow, we construct the full conversion expression by multiplying the initial concentration by these three factors:\n$$\nC_{amount} = \\left( 5.0\\ \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{10^{-3} \\text{ g}}{1 \\text{ mg}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1 \\text{ mol}}{M \\text{ g}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{10^{-3} \\text{ m}^3} \\right)\n$$\nTo verify the correctness of this construction, we first analyze the cancellation of units:\n$$\n\\frac{\\cancel{\\text{mg}}}{\\cancel{\\text{L}}} \\times \\frac{\\cancel{\\text{g}}}{\\cancel{\\text{mg}}} \\times \\frac{\\text{mol}}{\\cancel{\\text{g}}} \\times \\frac{\\cancel{\\text{L}}}{\\text{m}^3} = \\frac{\\text{mol}}{\\text{m}^3}\n$$\nThe units cancel to yield the desired units of $\\text{mol m}^{-3}$, confirming the dimensional correctness of the setup.\n\nNext, we evaluate the numerical and symbolic components of the expression:\n$$\nC_{amount} = 5.0 \\times \\frac{10^{-3}}{1} \\times \\frac{1}{M} \\times \\frac{1}{10^{-3}}\n$$\nWe group the numerical terms and the symbolic term $M$:\n$$\nC_{amount} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 1}{M \\times 10^{-3}}\n$$\nThe powers of $10$ are simplified using the property of exponents $a^x / a^x = 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{10^{-3}}{10^{-3}} = 10^{-3 - (-3)} = 10^0 = 1\n$$\nThe expression simplifies to:\n$$\nC_{amount} = \\frac{5.0}{M}\n$$\nThus, the concentration of $5.0 \\text{ mg L}^{-1}$ is equivalent to $\\frac{5.0}{M}\\ \\text{mol m}^{-3}$, where $M$ is the molar mass in $\\text{g mol}^{-1}$. This result stems from the fact that the conversion factor from $\\text{mg}$ to $\\text{g}$ ($10^{-3}$) is exactly cancelled by the conversion factor from $\\text{L}^{-1}$ to $\\text{m}^{-3}$ ($1/10^{-3}$).",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded and well-posed. It requires the derivation of the relationship between the concentration-based equilibrium constant, $K_c$, and the dimensionless thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K$, followed by a numerical calculation. We shall proceed with the solution, beginning from fundamental principles.\n\nThe chemical potential, $\\mu_i$, of a species $i$ in an ideal solution is defined in terms of its activity, $a_i$, by the relation:\n$$ \\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln a_i $$\nwhere $\\mu_i^\\circ$ is the standard chemical potential of species $i$ at the standard state, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The activity $a_i$ is a dimensionless quantity that represents the effective concentration of the species. For a solute $i$, the activity is defined as:\n$$ a_i = \\gamma_i \\frac{c_i}{c^\\circ} $$\nHere, $c_i$ is the molar concentration of the species, $c^\\circ$ is the standard state concentration (typically $1\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$ or $1\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ dm^{-3}}$), and $\\gamma_i$ is the dimensionless activity coefficient. Since the problem assumes ideal-solution behavior, the activity coefficient for all species is unity, $\\gamma_i = 1$. Therefore, the activity simplifies to the ratio of the concentration to the standard state concentration:\n$$ a_i = \\frac{c_i}{c^\\circ} $$\nAs $c_i$ and $c^\\circ$ have the same units, their ratio, $a_i$, is inherently dimensionless.\n\nFor a general chemical reaction, $\\sum_i \\nu_i X_i = 0$, the condition for chemical equilibrium is that the change in Gibbs free energy for the reaction, $\\Delta_rG$, is zero. This is expressed in terms of chemical potentials as:\n$$ \\Delta_rG = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i = 0 $$\nThe stoichiometric coefficients $\\nu_i$ are positive for products and negative for reactants. Substituting the expression for $\\mu_i$ yields:\n$$ \\sum_i \\nu_i (\\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln a_i) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\sum_i \\nu_i \\ln a_i = 0 $$\nThe term $\\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i^\\circ$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change of the reaction, $\\Delta_rG^\\circ$. The logarithmic term can be rewritten using the properties of logarithms:\n$$ \\Delta_rG^\\circ + RT \\ln \\left( \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i} \\right) = 0 $$\nThis defines the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K$:\n$$ K \\equiv \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i} $$\nSince each activity $a_i$ is dimensionless, the product $K$ must also be dimensionless. The equilibrium condition becomes the fundamental relation $\\Delta_rG^\\circ = -RT \\ln K$.\n\nNow, we apply this formalism to the specific reaction given:\n$$ 2\\,\\mathrm{A(aq)} + \\mathrm{B(aq)} \\rightleftharpoons 2\\,\\mathrm{C(aq)} $$\nThe stoichiometric coefficients are $\\nu_\\mathrm{A} = -2$, $\\nu_\\mathrm{B} = -1$, and $\\nu_\\mathrm{C} = +2$. The thermodynamic equilibrium constant $K$ is:\n$$ K = \\frac{a_\\mathrm{C}^2}{a_\\mathrm{A}^2 a_\\mathrm{B}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for activity, $a_i = c_i/c^\\circ$, we get:\n$$ K = \\frac{(c_\\mathrm{C}/c^\\circ)^2}{(c_\\mathrm{A}/c^\\circ)^2 (c_\\mathrm{B}/c^\\circ)} = \\frac{c_\\mathrm{C}^2}{c_\\mathrm{A}^2 c_\\mathrm{B}} \\cdot \\frac{(c^\\circ)^{-2}}{(c^\\circ)^{-2} (c^\\circ)^{-1}} = \\left(\\frac{c_\\mathrm{C}^2}{c_\\mathrm{A}^2 c_\\mathrm{B}}\\right) (c^\\circ)^{1} $$\nThe concentration-based equilibrium constant, $K_c$, is defined as the ratio of equilibrium concentrations raised to their stoichiometric powers:\n$$ K_c = \\frac{c_\\mathrm{C}^2}{c_\\mathrm{A}^2 c_\\mathrm{B}} $$\nThus, the relationship between the dimensionless constant $K$ and the dimensionful constant $K_c$ is:\n$$ K = K_c \\cdot c^\\circ $$\nMore generally, the relationship is $K = K_c (c^\\circ)^{-\\Delta\\nu}$, where $\\Delta\\nu = \\sum_i \\nu_i$ is the change in the sum of stoichiometric coefficients. For this reaction, $\\Delta\\nu = 2 - (2+1) = -1$. Therefore, $K = K_c (c^\\circ)^{-(-1)} = K_c c^\\circ$, which confirms our specific derivation.\n\nWe proceed to the calculation.

Scientific protocol dictates that the result of a multiplication with an exact number (like the conversion factor $10^3$) should retain the number of significant figures of the measurement. Thus, the result should be reported as $0.758$. However, the problem explicitly instructs to round the answer to four significant figures.
