            "solution": "The problem statement has been scrutinized and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. The premises are physically realistic and all necessary information for a unique solution is provided. The task is a standard application of the principles of uncertainty propagation in metrology, a fundamental concept in experimental science. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the relative standard uncertainty of the equilibrium constant, $u_r(K)$, given the relative standard uncertainties of the concentrations from which it is derived. The equilibrium constant $K$ is defined by the function:\n$$K = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{P}}}{\\left(c_{\\mathrm{R}}\\right)^{2}}$$\nwhere $c_{\\mathrm{P}}$ is the molar concentration of the product and $c_{\\mathrm{R}}$ is the molar concentration of the reactant. The problem states that the measurements of $c_{\\mathrm{P}}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{R}}$ are statistically independent.\n\nFor a general function of the form $Y = f(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)$, where the input quantities $X_i$ are independent, the square of the combined standard uncertainty, $u^2(Y)$, is given by the law of propagation of uncertainty:\n$$u^2(Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X_i}\\right)^2 u^2(X_i)$$\nThis can be expressed in terms of relative uncertainties. For a function that is a product of powers, such as $Y = C X_1^{a_1} X_2^{a_2} \\cdots X_n^{a_n}$, where $C$ is a constant with no uncertainty, the square of the relative standard uncertainty, $u_r^2(Y)$, simplifies to a weighted sum of the squares of the individual relative standard uncertainties:\n$$u_r^2(Y) = \\left(\\frac{u(Y)}{Y}\\right)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 \\left(\\frac{u(X_i)}{X_i}\\right)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 u_r^2(X_i)$$\nThe equilibrium constant is of this form, which can be written as $K = c_{\\mathrm{P}}^{1} c_{\\mathrm{R}}^{-2}$. The variables are $c_{\\mathrm{P}}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{R}}$, with corresponding exponents $a_{\\mathrm{P}} = 1$ and $a_{\\mathrm{R}} = -2$.\n\nApplying the simplified rule for propagation of relative uncertainties, the square of the relative standard uncertainty of $K$ is:\n$$u_r^2(K) = (a_{\\mathrm{P}})^2 u_r^2(c_{\\mathrm{P}}) + (a_{\\mathrm{R}})^2 u_r^2(c_{\\mathrm{R}})$$\nSubstituting the exponents $a_{\\mathrm{P}} = 1$ and $a_{\\mathrm{R}} = -2$:\n$$u_r^2(K) = (1)^2 u_r^2(c_{\\mathrm{P}}) + (-2)^2 u_r^2(c_{\\mathrm{R}})$$\n$$u_r^2(K) = u_r^2(c_{\\mathrm{P}}) + 4 u_r^2(c_{\\mathrm{R}})$$\nThe problem provides the following relative standard uncertainties:\n$$u_{r}(c_{\\mathrm{P}}) = 5\\% = 0.05$$\n$$u_{r}(c_{\\mathrm{R}}) = 2\\% = 0.02$$\nWe substitute these numerical values into the derived equation:\n$$u_r^2(K) = (0.05)^2 + 4(0.02)^2$$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$u_r^2(K) = 0.0025 + 4(0.0004)$$\n$$u_r^2(K) = 0.0025 + 0.0016$$\n$$u_r^2(K) = 0.0041$$\nTo find the relative standard uncertainty $u_r(K)$, we take the square root of this value:\n$$u_r(K) = \\sqrt{0.0041}$$\n$$u_r(K) \\approx 0.06403124237$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The first non-zero digit is $6$, so the three significant figures are $6$, $4$, and $0$.\n$$u_r(K) = 0.0640$$\nThis is the final numerical answer expressed as a pure decimal.",

            "problem": "You are modeling measurement and reporting for a spectroscopy-based concentration assay in general chemistry under a physically meaningful censoring constraint. A detector returns a baseline-corrected absorbance $A$ that, by the physics of absorption and the calibration pipeline, must satisfy $A \\ge 0$. The pre-censoring noise can be modeled with a Normal distribution with mean $\\mu_A$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_A$, which is a widely accepted empirical model for many instrumental noise sources. The concentration $c$ of the analyte is related to the absorbance by a linear calibration that follows Beer–Lambert law: $c = A / (\\varepsilon \\, \\ell)$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the molar absorptivity and $\\ell$ is the optical path length. You will demonstrate that Monte Carlo propagation can directly accommodate the censoring $A \\ge 0$ by sampling from the correctly truncated distribution, and you will show how censoring affects the mean and the central $95\\%$ credible interval of $c$ compared to an uncensored model.\n\nFundamental bases you may use: the law of large numbers, definitions of expected value and quantiles, properties of the Normal distribution, and the Beer–Lambert law. Do not use any closed-form formulas for truncated Normal moments. You must approximate by Monte Carlo sampling.\n\nDefinitions to use:\n- The expected value of a random variable $Z$ is $\\mathbb{E}[Z]$.\n- The central $95\\%$ credible interval of a sample of $Z$ is the interval between the empirical quantiles at probabilities $0.025$ and $0.975$.\n- A censored (truncated) Normal for $A$ enforces $A \\ge 0$ by drawing from the Normal distribution and rejecting values $A < 0$; programmatically you must draw directly from the truncated distribution to avoid inefficiency.\n- For reporting with significant figures, let $m$ be the Monte Carlo estimate of the mean of $c$ and let $L$ and $U$ be the lower and upper bounds of the central $95\\%$ credible interval. Define the half-width $h = (U - L)/2$.

            "solution": "The problem presented requires a quantitative analysis of a physically motivated censoring constraint in a common analytical chemistry scenario. We are to compare an idealized, uncensored model of a measurement with a more realistic, censored model where the physical quantity, absorbance, cannot be negative. The comparison is to be performed using Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation. The problem, as stated, is scientifically sound, well-posed, and provides all necessary information for a rigorous computational solution. We shall proceed.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the propagation of uncertainty from a noisy absorbance measurement, $A$, to a derived concentration, $c$. The relationship between these quantities is given by the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$ c = \\frac{A}{\\varepsilon \\ell} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is the molar absorptivity and $\\ell$ is the optical path length. For convenience, we define a constant $k = \\varepsilon \\ell$ for each experimental setup, so that $c = A/k$.\n\nThe problem specifies two models for the absorbance measurement, $A$:\n\n1.  **Uncensored Model**: This is an idealized model where the measurement noise is assumed to be perfectly Gaussian. We generate a large number, $N$, of absorbance samples, $\\{A_{\\mathrm{unc}, i}\\}_{i=1}^N$, by drawing from a Normal distribution, $A_{\\mathrm{unc}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_A, \\sigma_A^2)$. This model can produce non-physical negative absorbance values.\n\n2.  **Censored Model**: This model incorporates the physical constraint that absorbance cannot be negative, $A \\ge 0$. We generate $N$ samples, $\\{A_{\\mathrm{cen}, i}\\}_{i=1}^N$, by drawing from the same Normal distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_A, \\sigma_A^2)$, but truncated to the interval $[0, \\infty)$. This is the correct statistical representation of a measurement process that is fundamentally non-negative. Programmatically, this is achieved by sampling from a truncated Normal distribution, which is more efficient than a naive reject/accept loop.\n\nFor both models, each absorbance sample $A_i$ is transformed into a concentration sample $c_i = A_i/k$. This yields two sets of concentration samples, $\\{c_{\\mathrm{unc}, i}\\}$ and $\\{c_{\\mathrm{cen}, i}\\}$.\n\nFrom these samples, we perform statistical analysis as prescribed. For each set:\n- The mean concentration, $m$, is estimated as the sample mean: $m \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i$.\n- The central $95\\%$ credible interval, $[L, U]$, is determined by the empirical quantiles of the concentration samples at probabilities $p=0.025$ and $p=0.975$.\n- A reporting-friendly interval is constructed based on a specified rounding procedure. The half-width of the credible interval, $h = (U - L)/2$, is calculated and rounded to one significant figure to obtain $h_{\\mathrm{rounded}}$. The mean, $m$, is then rounded to the same decimal place as $h_{\\mathrm{rounded}}$, yielding $m_{\\mathrm{rounded}}$. The final reported interval is $[m_{\\mathrm{rounded}} - h_{\\mathrm{rounded}}, m_{\\mathrm{rounded}} + h_{\\mathrm{rounded}}]$, and the reported triple is $(m_{\\mathrm{rounded}}, L_{\\mathrm{rounded}}, U_{\\mathrm{rounded}})$.\n\nThe implementation uses `numpy` for array operations and random number generation, and `scipy.stats.truncnorm` for efficient sampling from the truncated Normal distribution. The parameters for `truncnorm` are derived from the problem's $\\mu_A$, $\\sigma_A$, and the lower truncation bound of $a=0$. The corresponding standardized lower bound is $\\alpha = (a - \\mu_A) / \\sigma_A = -\\mu_A / \\sigma_A$, while the upper bound is $\\beta = \\infty$. A fixed random seed ensures the reproducibility of the Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nThe selected test cases will illustrate the varying impact of censoring:\n- **Case 1 ($\\mu_A = 0.500, \\sigma_A = 0.010$)**: Here $\\mu_A \\gg \\sigma_A$, so the probability of $A<0$ is negligible. The censored and uncensored results should be nearly identical.\n- **Case 2 ($\\mu_A = 0.050, \\sigma_A = 0.050$)**: With $\\mu_A = \\sigma_A$, a significant fraction of the uncensored distribution is negative. Censoring will truncate this tail, leading to a higher mean concentration and a right-skewed distribution.\n- **Case 3 ($\\mu_A = 0.005, \\sigma_A = 0.010$)**: With $\\mu_A < \\sigma_A$, the censoring effect is even more pronounced. The mean of the censored distribution will be substantially shifted to a positive value, and the distribution will be highly distorted compared to the parent Normal.\n- **Case 4 ($\\mu_A = -0.002, \\sigma_A = 0.005$)**: The true mean absorbance is negative, a scenario that can occur due to baseline overcorrection. The uncensored model would yield an unphysical negative mean concentration. The censored model correctly reflects the physical reality, producing only non-negative absorbances and thus a physically meaningful, positive mean concentration. This case highlights the critical importance of proper physical modeling.",
