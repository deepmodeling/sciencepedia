The problem is well-posed, providing a complete set of definitions from which to derive the requested relationships. The language is objective and unambiguous. It is a standard problem designed to test fundamental understanding.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived from the provided first principles.\n\nWe begin by deriving the relationship between the reaction Gibbs energy, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G$, and a quotient of activities. Let the forward reaction be denoted with the subscript 'f'.\nThe reaction Gibbs energy is given by:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\sum_i \\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}} \\mu_i $$\nSubstituting the definition of chemical potential, $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_i$:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\sum_i \\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}} (\\mu_i^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_i) = \\sum_i \\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}} \\mu_i^{\\circ} + \\sum_i \\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}} RT \\ln a_i $$\nThe first term is the standard reaction Gibbs energy, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ} = \\sum_i \\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}} \\mu_i^{\\circ}$. Using the properties of logarithms, the second term becomes $RT \\sum_i \\ln(a_i^{\\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}}}) = RT \\ln (\\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}}})$.\nThis leads to the expression:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln \\left( \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}}} \\right) $$\nThe term $\\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}}}$ is the reaction quotient, $Q$. For the forward reaction, let us denote it $Q_{\\mathrm{f}}$.\n$$ Q_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}}} $$\nThus, we have derived the fundamental relation $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln Q_{\\mathrm{f}}$.\nAt chemical equilibrium, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}} = 0$, and the reaction quotient becomes the equilibrium constant, $Q_{\\mathrm{f}} = K_{\\mathrm{f}}$. This gives the relationship $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{f}}$.\n\nNow, consider the reversed reaction, denoted by the subscript 'r'. Reversing the reaction implies changing the sign of all stoichiometric numbers: $\\nu_{i,\\mathrm{r}} = -\\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}}$.\nThe reaction Gibbs energy for the reversed reaction, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{r}}$, at the same composition (same set of activities $a_i$) is:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{r}} = \\sum_i \\nu_{i,\\mathrm{r}} \\mu_i = \\sum_i (-\\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}}) \\mu_i = - \\left( \\sum_i \\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}} \\mu_i \\right) = -\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}} $$\nThe standard reaction Gibbs energy for the reversed reaction is:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{r}}^{\\circ} = \\sum_i \\nu_{i,\\mathrm{r}} \\mu_i^{\\circ} = \\sum_i (-\\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}}) \\mu_i^{\\circ} = - \\left( \\sum_i \\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}} \\mu_i^{\\circ} \\right) = -\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ} $$\nThe reaction quotient for the reversed reaction, $Q_{\\mathrm{r}}$, is constructed using the new stoichiometric numbers:\n$$ Q_{\\mathrm{r}} = \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_{i,\\mathrm{r}}} = \\prod_i a_i^{-\\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}}} = \\left( \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_{i,\\mathrm{f}}} \\right)^{-1} = (Q_{\\mathrm{f}})^{-1} = \\frac{1}{Q_{\\mathrm{f}}} $$\nThe equilibrium constant for the reversed reaction, $K_{\\mathrm{r}}$, is related to its standard reaction Gibbs energy: $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{r}}^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{r}}$.\nSubstituting our derived relations:\n$$ -\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{r}} $$\n$$ -(-RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{f}}) = -RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{r}} $$\n$$ RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{f}} = -RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{r}} \\implies \\ln K_{\\mathrm{f}} = -\\ln K_{\\mathrm{r}} = \\ln(K_{\\mathrm{r}}^{-1}) $$\nThis implies $K_{\\mathrm{f}} = K_{\\mathrm{r}}^{-1}$, or $K_{\\mathrm{r}} = K_{\\mathrm{f}}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{K_{\\mathrm{f}}}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. When the reaction is reversed, the activity-based reaction quotient $Q$ is inverted and the equilibrium constant $K$ is inverted; consequently, at any fixed composition and temperature, the reaction Gibbs energy for the reversed reaction equals the negative of that for the forward reaction.\nOur derivations show that $Q_{\\mathrm{r}} = 1/Q_{\\mathrm{f}}$, $K_{\\mathrm{r}} = 1/K_{\\mathrm{f}}$, and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{r}} = -\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}}$. All parts of this statement are correct. The final conclusion follows directly from the change in sign of the stoichiometric numbers, as shown in the derivation of $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{r}}$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. If $Q_{\\mathrm{f}}<K_{\\mathrm{f}}$ for the forward reaction, then $Q_{\\mathrm{r}}<K_{\\mathrm{r}}$ for the reversed labeling; nonetheless, both labelings predict motion toward the products of the forward reaction.\nGiven the inequality $Q_{\\mathrm{f}} < K_{\\mathrm{f}}$, and knowing that all these quantities are positive, taking the reciprocal of both sides reverses the inequality sign: $1/Q_{\\mathrm{f}} > 1/K_{\\mathrm{f}}$. From our derivations, this is equivalent to $Q_{\\mathrm{r}} > K_{\\mathrm{r}}$. The first part of the statement is therefore false. The condition $Q_{\\mathrm{f}} < K_{\\mathrm{f}}$ implies $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}} < 0$, so the reaction proceeds spontaneously in the forward direction. The condition $Q_{\\mathrm{r}} > K_{\\mathrm{r}}$ implies $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{r}} > 0$, meaning the reverse of the 'r' reaction is spontaneous. The reverse of the 'r' reaction is the 'f' reaction, so this also predicts motion toward the products of the forward reaction. While the second part of the statement is correct, the first part is false, making the entire statement incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. In the general activity-based definition with stoichiometric numbers, reversing the reaction changes the sign of every $\\nu_i$, which implies $\\ln Q$ changes sign. Therefore, for any composition with $Q_{\\mathrm{f}}=10$, one has $Q_{\\mathrm{r}}=0.10$, and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{r}}=-\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}}$ at that composition.\nWe have $\\ln Q = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\ln a_i$. When reversing the reaction, $\\nu_i \\to -\\nu_i$, so $\\ln Q \\to \\sum_i (-\\nu_i) \\ln a_i = -(\\sum_i \\nu_i \\ln a_i) = -\\ln Q$. Thus, $\\ln Q$ changes sign. This implies $\\ln Q_{\\mathrm{r}} = -\\ln Q_{\\mathrm{f}}$, or $Q_{\\mathrm{r}} = 1/Q_{\\mathrm{f}}$. If $Q_{\\mathrm{f}} = 10$, then $Q_{\\mathrm{r}} = 1/10 = 0.10$. This numerical example is correct. Finally, as derived earlier, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{r}} = -\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G_{\\mathrm{f}}$ for any given composition. The statement is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. In highly nonideal solutions, because activity coefficients differ between reactants and products, the inversion property can fail, so one can have $Q_{\\mathrm{r}}\\neq 1/Q_{\\mathrm{f}}$ even when the same standard states are used.\nThe relationship $Q_{\\mathrm{r}} = 1/Q_{\\mathrm{f}}$ is a direct mathematical consequence of the definition $Q = \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i}$ and the reversal of signs of the exponents $\\nu_i$. The concept of activity, $a_i$, is specifically defined to preserve this thermodynamic formalism regardless of the nonideality of the mixture. Nonideality is accounted for within the activities themselves (e.g., via activity coefficients, $a_i = \\gamma_i x_i$). The relationship between the forward and reverse reaction quotients is therefore independent of the ideality of the solution. The statement is based on a flawed premise.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. If all stoichiometric numbers are rescaled by a positive factor $\\alpha$ (i.e., the reaction is written with coefficients multiplied by $\\alpha$), then $Q$ is replaced by $Q^{\\alpha}$ and $K$ by $K^{\\alpha}$; as a result, the truth value of $Q<K$ is invariant under such rescaling, but it flips under reaction reversal because both sides are inverted.\nLet the new stoichiometric numbers be $\\nu'_i = \\alpha \\nu_i$. The new quotient is $Q' = \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu'_i} = \\prod_i a_i^{\\alpha \\nu_i} = (\\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i})^{\\alpha} = Q^{\\alpha}$. The new standard Gibbs energy is $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G'^{\\circ} = \\alpha\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G^{\\circ}$, which leads to $-RT\\ln K' = \\alpha(-RT \\ln K)$, so $K' = K^{\\alpha}$. This confirms the first part of the statement. Since $\\alpha > 0$, the function $f(x)=x^{\\alpha}$ is strictly increasing for $x>0$. Therefore, $Q<K \\iff Q^{\\alpha}<K^{\\alpha}$ (i.e., $Q'<K'$), so the truth value of the inequality is invariant. Under reaction reversal ($\\alpha=-1$ effectively, though the statement treats reversal separately), $Q \\to 1/Q$ and $K \\to 1/K$. Since the function $g(x)=1/x$ is strictly decreasing for $x>0$, the inequality $Q<K$ becomes $1/Q>1/K$. The truth value of a \"<\" comparison flips. The entire statement is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.",

We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is constructed in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: The Reaction Quotient, Q**\n\nFor a general chemical reaction $\\sum_i \\nu_i X_i = 0$, where $\\nu_i$ are the stoichiometric coefficients (positive for products, negative for reactants) and $X_i$ are the chemical species, the reaction quotient $Q$ is defined as the product of the activities $a_i$ raised to the power of their respective stoichiometric coefficients:\n$$Q = \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i}$$\nThe given half-reaction is $\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}} + \\mathrm{e^{-}} \\to \\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$. This can be written in the general form as $\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}} - \\mathrm{Fe^{3+}} - \\mathrm{e^{-}} = 0$.\nThe species are $X_1 = \\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$, $X_2 = \\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}$, and $X_3 = \\mathrm{e^{-}}$. The corresponding stoichiometric coefficients are $\\nu_1 = 1$, $\\nu_2 = -1$, and $\\nu_3 = -1$.\nApplying the definition of $Q$:\n$$Q = a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}}^{1} \\cdot a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}}^{-1} \\cdot a_{\\mathrm{e^{-}}}^{-1} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}} a_{\\mathrm{e^{-}}}}$$\nThis expression includes the thermodynamic activity of the electron, $a_{\\mathrm{e^{-}}}$. For an electron involved in a half-reaction at a metallic electrode, the standard convention is to assume the electron exists in its standard state, which is that of a pure conductor (the electrode itself). By definition, the activity of a pure substance in its standard state is unity.\n**Assumption:** The activity of the electron is unity, $a_{\\mathrm{e^{-}}} = 1$.\nUnder this standard and necessary assumption, the reaction quotient for the half-reaction simplifies to:\n$$Q = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}}}$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Electrode Potential Expression**\n\nWe begin with the fundamental thermodynamic definition of chemical potential, $\\mu_i$, for a species $i$ at temperature $T$:\n$$\\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln a_i$$\nwhere $\\mu_i^\\circ$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $a_i$ is the activity of species $i$.\n\nThe Gibbs energy of reaction, $\\Delta_rG$, is the sum of the chemical potentials of the products minus the sum of the chemical potentials of the reactants, weighted by their stoichiometric coefficients:\n$$\\Delta_rG = \\sum \\nu_p \\mu_p - \\sum \\nu_r \\mu_r$$\nFor the reaction $\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}} + \\mathrm{e^{-}} \\to \\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$:\n$$\\Delta_rG = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}} - (\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{e^{-}}})$$\nSubstituting the expression for chemical potential for each species:\n$$\\Delta_rG = (\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}}^\\circ + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}}) - [(\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}}^\\circ + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}}) + (\\mu_{\\mathrm{e^{-}}}^\\circ + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{e^{-}}})]$$\nWe group the standard potential terms and the logarithmic terms:\n$$\\Delta_rG = (\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}}^\\circ - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}}^\\circ - \\mu_{\\mathrm{e^{-}}}^\\circ) + RT(\\ln a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}} - \\ln a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}} - \\ln a_{\\mathrm{e^{-}}})$$\nThe term in the first parenthesis is the standard Gibbs energy of reaction, $\\Delta_rG^\\circ$:\n$$\\Delta_rG^\\circ = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}}^\\circ - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}}^\\circ - \\mu_{\\mathrm{e^{-}}}^\\circ$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, the second term simplifies:\n$$RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}} a_{\\mathrm{e^{-}}}} \\right) = RT \\ln Q$$\nwhere $Q$ is the full reaction quotient derived in Part 1. Thus, the Gibbs energy expression is:\n$$\\Delta_rG = \\Delta_rG^\\circ + RT \\ln Q$$\nThe third given principle is the relation between the reaction Gibbs energy and the maximum electrical work done by an electrochemical cell, which equals the cell potential, $E$:\n$$\\Delta_rG = -nFE$$\nHere, $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the balanced reaction, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. For the half-reaction $\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}} + \\mathrm{e^{-}} \\to \\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$, $n=1$.\n$$\\Delta_rG = -FE$$\nUnder standard conditions (all species at unit activity), this relation is:\n$$\\Delta_rG^\\circ = -nFE^\\circ = -FE^\\circ$$\nwhere $E^\\circ$ is the standard electrode potential.\nSubstituting these electrochemical relations into the thermodynamic Gibbs energy equation:\n$$-FE = -FE^\\circ + RT \\ln Q$$\nDividing the entire equation by $-F$ yields the final expression for the electrode potential, known as the Nernst equation:\n$$E = E^\\circ - \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln Q$$\nThis equation relates the half-cell potential $E$ under non-standard conditions to its standard potential $E^\\circ$ and the reaction quotient $Q$.

A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the error factor $E \\equiv \\frac{Q_{\\text{ideal}}}{Q_{\\text{fug}}}$ and to compute its numerical value for the given gas-phase reaction:\n$$ \\mathrm{CO(g)} + \\mathrm{H_2O(g)} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO_2(g)} + \\mathrm{H_2(g)} $$\nThe stoichiometric coefficients for the species are $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CO}} = -1$, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = -1$, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = 1$, and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 1$. It is important to note that the sum of the stoichiometric coefficients is $\\sum_i \\nu_i = (-1) + (-1) + 1 + 1 = 0$.\n\nThe reaction quotient, $Q$, is defined in terms of the activities, $a_i$, of the reacting species as:\n$$ Q = \\prod_{i} a_i^{\\nu_i} $$\nFor the specific reaction under consideration, this becomes:\n$$ Q = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} a_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{a_{\\mathrm{CO}} a_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} $$\nThe activity $a_i$ of a component $i$ in a gas mixture is defined as the ratio of its fugacity, $f_i$, in the mixture to its standard-state fugacity, which is typically the standard pressure $p^{\\circ}$:\n$$ a_i = \\frac{f_i}{p^{\\circ}} $$\nSubstituting this definition into the expression for the reaction quotient gives the rigorous, fugacity-based reaction quotient, $Q_{\\text{fug}}$:\n$$ Q_{\\text{fug}} = \\frac{(f_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}/p^{\\circ})(f_{\\mathrm{H_2}}/p^{\\circ})}{(f_{\\mathrm{CO}}/p^{\\circ})(f_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}/p^{\\circ})} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} f_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{f_{\\mathrm{CO}} f_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{p^{\\circ}} \\right)^{\\sum_i \\nu_i} $$\nSince $\\sum_i \\nu_i = 0$ for this reaction, the term involving the standard pressure becomes $(1/p^{\\circ})^0 = 1$. Thus, for this specific reaction:\n$$ Q_{\\text{fug}} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} f_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{f_{\\mathrm{CO}} f_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} $$\nThe fugacity $f_i$ of a component $i$ in a gas mixture is related to its fugacity coefficient $\\phi_i$, its mole fraction $y_i$, and the total pressure $P$ by the relation:\n$$ f_i = \\phi_i y_i P $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $Q_{\\text{fug}}$:\n$$ Q_{\\text{fug}} = \\frac{(\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} y_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} P)(\\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2}} P)}{(\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO}} y_{\\mathrm{CO}} P)(\\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} P)} = \\left(\\frac{y_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{y_{\\mathrm{CO}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}\\right) P^{\\sum_i \\nu_i} $$\nAgain, since $\\sum_i \\nu_i = 0$, the pressure term $P^0 = 1$, and we have:\n$$ Q_{\\text{fug}} = \\left(\\frac{y_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{y_{\\mathrm{CO}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}\\right) $$\nThe ideal-gas reaction quotient, $Q_{\\text{ideal}}$, is obtained by assuming ideal gas behavior for all components. This assumption is equivalent to setting all fugacity coefficients to unity, i.e., $\\phi_i = 1$ for all $i$. Applying this condition to the expression for $Q_{\\text{fug}}$:\n$$ Q_{\\text{ideal}} = \\left(\\frac{y_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{y_{\\mathrm{CO}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1 \\cdot 1}{1 \\cdot 1}\\right) = \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{y_{\\mathrm{CO}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} $$\nNow, we can derive the expression for the multiplicative error factor $E$, which is defined as $E \\equiv \\frac{Q_{\\text{ideal}}}{Q_{\\text{fug}}}$.\n$$ E = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{y_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{y_{\\mathrm{CO}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{y_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{y_{\\mathrm{CO}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}\\right)} $$\nThe terms involving mole fractions cancel, yielding the final symbolic expression for $E$:\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}} = \\frac{\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2}}} $$\nThis expression can be written generally as $E = \\prod_i \\phi_i^{-\\nu_i}$. This completes the derivation.\n\nThe final step is to evaluate $E$ numerically using the provided data: $\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO}} = 0.72$, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 0.88$, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = 0.95$, and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 1.08$.\n$$ E = \\frac{(0.72)(0.88)}{(0.95)(1.08)} $$\nFirst, we compute the numerator and the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = 0.72 \\times 0.88 = 0.6336 $$\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = 0.95 \\times 1.08 = 1.026 $$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$ E = \\frac{0.6336}{1.026} \\approx 0.617543859... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives:\n$$ E \\approx 0.6175 $$\nThis value represents the factor by which the ideal-gas approximation of the reaction quotient over- or underestimates the true, fugacity-based quotient. Since $E < 1$, the ideal-gas quotient is smaller than the fugacity-based quotient in this case. Correction, the ratio is $E \\equiv Q_{\\text{ideal}} / Q_{\\text{fug}}$, so $Q_{\\text{ideal}} = E \\times Q_{\\text{fug}}$. My definition of E was correct. The value $E \\approx 0.6175$ means the ideal-gas reaction quotient is approximately $61.75\\%$ of the true fugacity-based reaction quotient under these conditions.",
