We observe that the target reaction requires $\\ce{CaCO3(s)}$ and $\\ce{CO2(aq)}$ as reactants, and $\\ce{Ca^{2+}(aq)}$ and two equivalents of $\\ce{HCO3^{-}(aq)}$ as products.\nWe can construct the target reaction by the following algebraic sum of chemical equations:\n1.  Reaction 1 (as is): $\\ce{CaCO3(s) => Ca^{2+}(aq) + CO3^{2-}(aq)}$\n2.  Reaction 2 (as is): $\\ce{CO2(aq) + H2O(l) => H^{+}(aq) + HCO3^{-}(aq)}$\n3.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in chemical thermodynamics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we must derive an expression for the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant, $K$. Second, we compute a specific temperature, $T^\\star$, for given thermodynamic data.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the van 't Hoff Equation\n\nThe derivation begins from two fundamental thermodynamic equations. The first relates the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta_{r} G^\\circ$, to the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K$, at an absolute temperature $T$:\n$$ \\Delta_{r} G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant. This equation can be rearranged to express $\\ln K$:\n$$ \\ln K = -\\frac{\\Delta_{r} G^\\circ}{RT} $$\nThe second fundamental equation is the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, which describes the temperature dependence of the Gibbs free energy. For a chemical reaction under standard conditions, it is written as:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dT}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_{r} G^\\circ}{T}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta_{r} H^\\circ}{T^2} $$\nwhere $\\Delta_{r} H^\\circ$ is the standard reaction enthalpy. The problem states that $\\Delta_{r} H^\\circ$ is independent of temperature in the range of interest.\n\nTo find the temperature derivative of $\\ln K$, we can substitute the first relation into the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. From the first equation, we have $\\frac{\\Delta_{r} G^\\circ}{T} = -R \\ln K$. Substituting this into the left-hand side of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dT}(-R \\ln K) = -\\frac{\\Delta_{r} H^\\circ}{T^2} $$\nSince $R$ is a constant, it can be taken out of the derivative:\n$$ -R \\frac{d(\\ln K)}{dT} = -\\frac{\\Delta_{r} H^\\circ}{T^2} $$\nDividing both sides by $-R$ yields the desired expression, which is known as the van 't Hoff equation:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\ln K)}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta_{r} H^\\circ}{RT^2} $$\nThis equation quantifies how the natural logarithm of the equilibrium constant changes with temperature, as a function of the standard reaction enthalpy and temperature. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Transition Temperature $T^\\star$\n\nThe second part asks for the absolute temperature, $T^\\star$, at which the equilibrium constant is equal to unity, i.e., $K(T^\\star) = 1$.\nWhen $K = 1$, the natural logarithm of the equilibrium constant is zero:\n$$ \\ln K = \\ln(1) = 0 $$\nSubstituting $\\ln K = 0$ into the fundamental relation $\\Delta_{r} G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K$, we find that the standard Gibbs free energy change must also be zero at this specific temperature $T^\\star$:\n$$ \\Delta_{r} G^\\circ(T^\\star) = -RT^\\star \\ln(1) = 0 $$\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change is also related to the standard reaction enthalpy, $\\Delta_{r} H^\\circ$, and the standard reaction entropy, $\\Delta_{r} S^\\circ$, by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta_{r} G^\\circ = \\Delta_{r} H^\\circ - T \\Delta_{r} S^\\circ $$\nAt the temperature $T^\\star$ where $\\Delta_{r} G^\\circ = 0$, this becomes:\n$$ 0 = \\Delta_{r} H^\\circ - T^\\star \\Delta_{r} S^\\circ $$\nThis temperature $T^\\star$ represents the point where the reaction transitions from being spontaneous ($\\Delta_{r} G^\\circ  0$) to non-spontaneous ($\\Delta_{r} G^\\circ  0$), or vice versa, under standard conditions. We can solve for $T^\\star$:\n$$ T^\\star \\Delta_{r} S^\\circ = \\Delta_{r} H^\\circ $$\n$$ T^\\star = \\frac{\\Delta_{r} H^\\circ}{\\Delta_{r} S^\\circ} $$\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\n$$ \\Delta_{r} H^\\circ = -57.20\\ \\text{kJ}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta_{r} S^\\circ = -175.83\\ \\text{J}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{K}^{-1} $$\nBefore substituting these values, we must ensure unit consistency. The enthalpy is given in kilojoules, while the entropy is in joules.

The numerator, derived from $\\Delta_{r} H^\\circ$, has four significant figures. Thus, the result must be reported with four significant figures.\n$$ T^\\star \\approx 325.3\\ \\text{K} $$\nThe information that the reaction is exothermic ($\\Delta_{r} H^\\circ  0$) and results in a decrease in the number of gas molecules (implying $\\Delta_{r} S^\\circ  0$) is consistent with the provided data and leads to a physically meaningful positive absolute temperature.",

For simplicity in notation, we assume concentrations $[i]$ are implicitly dimensionless ratios $[i]/c^{\\circ}$, so $a_i = \\gamma_i [i]$.\n\n**1. Derivation of pH from the Conditional Constant ($\\text{pH}_{\\text{cond}}$)**\nThe conditional constant, $K_{a}'$, is defined on the concentration scale:\n$$\nK_{a}' = \\frac{[\\ce{H+}][\\ce{A-}]}{[\\ce{HA}]}\n$$\nWe relate this to the thermodynamic constant $K_a$ by substituting $a_i = \\gamma_i [i]$ into the expression for $K_a$:\n$$\nK_{a} = \\frac{(\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}}[\\ce{H+}])(\\gamma_{\\ce{A-}}[\\ce{A-}])}{(\\gamma_{\\ce{HA}}[\\ce{HA}])} = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}}\\gamma_{\\ce{A-}}}{\\gamma_{\\ce{HA}}}\\right) \\frac{[\\ce{H+}][\\ce{A-}]}{[\\ce{HA}]} = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}}\\gamma_{\\ce{A-}}}{\\gamma_{\\ce{HA}}}\\right) K_{a}'\n$$\nRearranging gives the expression for $K_{a}'$:\n$$\nK_{a}' = K_{a} \\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{HA}}}{\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}}\\gamma_{\\ce{A-}}}\n$$\nThe \"conditional constant approach\" typically involves calculating equilibrium concentrations using $K_a'$ and then determining the pH. A common but flawed shortcut in this method is to equate $\\mathrm{pH}$ with $\\mathrm{p[H^{+}]} = -\\log_{10}([\\ce{H+}])$. This implies an incorrect assumption that $\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}} = 1$. We will proceed with this interpretation, as it is the only way to generate a non-zero difference between the two methods as implied by the problem statement.\nFrom the definition of $K_{a}'$, we have $[\\ce{H+}] = K_{a}' \\frac{[\\ce{HA}]}{[\\ce{A-}]}$.\nThe \"pH\" predicted by this method, $\\text{pH}_{\\text{cond}}$, is thus:\n$$\n\\text{pH}_{\\text{cond}} = -\\log_{10}([\\ce{H+}]) = -\\log_{10}\\left(K_{a}' \\frac{[\\ce{HA}]}{[\\ce{A-}]}\\right) = \\mathrm{p}K_{a}' + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\ce{A-}]}{[\\ce{HA}]}\\right)\n$$\nFor the given buffer, the formal concentrations are equal, $[\\ce{HA}]_{0} = [\\ce{A-}]_{0} = 0.0100 \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. The extent of dissociation or hydrolysis is minimal, so we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations as $[\\ce{HA}] \\approx [\\ce{HA}]_{0}$ and $[\\ce{A-}] \\approx [\\ce{A-}]_{0}$. The concentration ratio is therefore unity, and the logarithm term is zero.\n$$\n\\text{pH}_{\\text{cond}} \\approx \\mathrm{p}K_{a}' = -\\log_{10}\\left(K_{a} \\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{HA}}}{\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}}\\gamma_{\\ce{A-}}}\\right) = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} - \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ce{HA}}) + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}}) + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ce{A-}})\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of pH from the Activity-Based Method ($\\text{pH}_{\\text{act}}$)**\nThis method is thermodynamically rigorous. We start with the expression for $K_a$ and rearrange it to solve for $a_{\\ce{H+}}$:\n$$\na_{\\ce{H+}} = K_{a} \\frac{a_{\\ce{HA}}}{a_{\\ce{A-}}}\n$$\nBy definition, $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(a_{\\ce{H+}})$. Taking the negative base-10 logarithm of the equation gives the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in its proper activity form:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a}) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{a_{\\ce{HA}}}{a_{\\ce{A-}}}\\right) = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{a_{\\ce{A-}}}{a_{\\ce{HA}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the expression for $\\text{pH}_{\\text{act}}$. We now substitute $a_i = \\gamma_i [i]$ and use the same buffer concentration approximation, $[\\ce{HA}] \\approx [\\ce{HA}]_{0}$ and $[\\ce{A-}] \\approx [\\ce{A-}]_{0}$.\n$$\n\\text{pH}_{\\text{act}} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{A-}}[\\ce{A-}]}{\\gamma_{\\ce{HA}}[\\ce{HA}]}\\right) \\approx \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{A-}}[\\ce{A-}]_{0}}{\\gamma_{\\ce{HA}}[\\ce{HA}]_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nSince $[\\ce{HA}]_{0} = [\\ce{A-}]_{0}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{pH}_{\\text{act}} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{A-}}}{\\gamma_{\\ce{HA}}}\\right) = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ce{A-}}) - \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ce{HA}})\n$$\n\n**3. Symbolic Formula for $\\Delta \\text{pH}$ and Numerical Evaluation**\nWe now find the difference $\\Delta \\text{pH} = \\text{pH}_{\\text{cond}} - \\text{pH}_{\\text{act}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{pH} = (\\mathrm{p}K_{a} - \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ce{HA}}) + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}}) + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ce{A-}})) - (\\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ce{A-}}) - \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ce{HA}}))\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{pH} = \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}})\n$$\nThis symbolic result reveals the origin of the discrepancy. The difference between the rigorous activity-based calculation and the simplified conditional constant method (which incorrectly assumes $\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p[H^+]}$) is precisely the logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity coefficient.\n\nTo evaluate this numerically, we must compute $\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}}$ using the Davies equation at ionic strength $I = 0.100$. For a monovalent ion like $\\ce{H+}$ (or $\\ce{A-}$), the charge number is $z_{i} = 1$, so $z_{i}^{2} = 1$. The constant $A = 0.509$.\n$$\n-\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}} = A z_{\\ce{H+}}^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}}-0.3\\,I\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}} = (0.509)(1^{2})\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{0.100}}{1+\\sqrt{0.100}}-0.3(0.100)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}} = 0.509 \\left(\\frac{0.316227...}{1.316227...}-0.03\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}} = 0.509 (0.24025... - 0.03) = 0.509 (0.21025...)\n$$\n$$\n-\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}} = 0.107018...\n$$\nThe value required is $\\Delta \\text{pH} = \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}})$, which is the negative of the value just calculated.\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{pH} = -0.107018...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required gives $\\Delta \\text{pH} = -0.1070$. The negative sign indicates that the simplified conditional method overestimates the pH compared to the rigorous activity-based method. This is because in an ionic solution $\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}}  1$, which makes its logarithm negative.",
