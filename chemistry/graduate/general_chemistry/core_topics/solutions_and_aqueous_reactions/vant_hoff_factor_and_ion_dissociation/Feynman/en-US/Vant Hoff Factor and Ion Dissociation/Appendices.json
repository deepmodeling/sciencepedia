In this first exercise, we will explore this fundamental connection in the context of a simple dissociation equilibrium.

            "problem": "A nonelectrolyte produces colligative effects proportional to the number of solute particles present. For an electrolyte that may dissociate, the observed colligative response is often summarized by the van’t Hoff factor $i$, defined operationally from any colligative property as the ratio of the measured effect to the value expected for the same molality if no dissociation or association occurred.

            "solution": "The starting point is the particle-number interpretation of colligative properties: for a solute that can dissociate or associate, the magnitude of any colligative property at fixed composition is proportional to the total number of solute particles present. The van’t Hoff factor $i$ is defined as the ratio of the actual number of solute particles in solution to the number of formula units that would be present if no dissociation or association occurred, evaluated at the same overall composition. For a dissociating solute, this is equivalently the ratio of the actual total solute particle molality to the initial formula-unit molality.\n\nLet the solute be the $1{:}1$ electrolyte $AB$ that can dissociate according to\n$$\nAB \\rightleftharpoons A^{+} + B^{-}.\n$$\nLet the initial formula-unit molality of $AB$ (before dissociation) be $m_{0}$. The degree of dissociation (fraction dissociated) is denoted by $\\alpha$, so that a fraction $\\alpha$ of $AB$ dissociates and a fraction $1-\\alpha$ remains as undissociated $AB$.\n\nAccounting for conservation of the total amount of solute (in formula units) and using molality as the concentration measure, the molalities of each chemical species after dissociation are\n$$\nm_{AB} = m_{0}\\left(1-\\alpha\\right), \\quad m_{A^{+}} = m_{0}\\alpha, \\quad m_{B^{-}} = m_{0}\\alpha.\n$$\nThe total solute particle molality present is the sum\n$$\nm_{\\text{particles}} = m_{AB} + m_{A^{+}} + m_{B^{-}} = m_{0}\\left(1-\\alpha\\right) + m_{0}\\alpha + m_{0}\\alpha = m_{0}\\left(1+\\alpha\\right).\n$$\nBy the operational definition of the van’t Hoff factor,\n$$\ni = \\frac{m_{\\text{particles}}}{m_{0}} = \\frac{m_{0}\\left(1+\\alpha\\right)}{m_{0}} = 1 + \\alpha.\n$$\nThus, for a $1{:}1$ electrolyte, the degree of dissociation is directly\n$$\n\\alpha = i - 1.\n$$\n\nThe problem gives $m_{0} = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ and $i = 1.20$.

Provide $\\nu$ as an integer. The final numerical response must be dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the van't Hoff factor, $i$, and the stoichiometric number of ions, $\\nu$, for an unknown strong electrolyte in an aqueous solution. The analysis will proceed from the fundamental principles of colligative properties.\n\nThe boiling-point elevation, $\\Delta T_b$, is a colligative property that depends on the total molality of solute particles in a solution. For an electrolyte that dissociates into multiple ions, the effective molality is the product of the stoichiometric molality, $m$, and the van't Hoff factor, $i$. The relationship is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta T_b = i \\cdot K_b \\cdot m\n$$\nwhere $K_b$ is the ebullioscopic constant of the solvent.\n\nFirst, we must validate the given units. The boiling-point elevation is given as $\\Delta T_b = 0.384\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. A temperature difference in degrees Celsius is numerically identical to a temperature difference in Kelvin, so we can state $\\Delta T_b = 0.384\\ \\mathrm{K}$. The ebullioscopic constant for water is $K_b = 0.512\\ \\mathrm{K\\,kg\\,mol^{-1}}$, and the solute molality is $m = 0.300\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$. All units are consistent within the SI system.\n\nTo determine the van't Hoff factor, $i$, we rearrange the boiling-point elevation equation:\n$$\ni = \\frac{\\Delta T_b}{K_b \\cdot m}\n$$\nSubstituting the provided numerical values:\n$$\ni = \\frac{0.384\\ \\mathrm{K}}{(0.512\\ \\mathrm{K\\,kg\\,mol^{-1}}) \\cdot (0.300\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}})}\n$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\ni = \\frac{0.384}{0.1536} = 2.50\n$$\nThe problem requests the value of $i$ to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $2.50$, which satisfies this requirement.\n\nNext, we must infer the most likely integer value for $\\nu$, the number of ions produced per formula unit of the solute upon dissociation. The van't Hoff factor is related to $\\nu$ and the degree of dissociation, $\\alpha$, by the following expression:\n$$\ni = 1 + \\alpha(\\nu - 1)\n$$\nThe degree of dissociation, $\\alpha$, is constrained to the interval $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$. From this constraint, we can derive a fundamental relationship between $i$ and $\\nu$:\nSince $\\alpha \\ge 0$, it follows that $i = 1 + \\alpha(\\nu - 1) \\ge 1 + 0(\\nu - 1) = 1$.\nSince $\\alpha \\le 1$, it follows that $i = 1 + \\alpha(\\nu - 1) \\le 1 + 1(\\nu - 1) = \\nu$.\nThus, the van't Hoff factor must satisfy the condition $1 \\le i \\le \\nu$.\n\nGiven our calculated value $i = 2.50$, we must have $\\nu \\ge 2.50$. Since $\\nu$ must be an integer representing the number of discrete ions, the smallest possible integer value for $\\nu$ is $3$.\n\nLet us examine the possible integer values for $\\nu$ and the corresponding degree of dissociation, $\\alpha$, required to produce $i = 2.50$.\nRearranging the formula for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{i - 1}{\\nu - 1}\n$$\nWe test plausible integer values for $\\nu \\ge 2$ (since it is an electrolyte).\n\nCase $1$: $\\nu = 2$.\nThis would correspond to a solute that dissociates into $2$ ions (e.g., NaCl). The theoretical range for $i$ would be $1 \\le i \\le 2$. Our experimental value of $i = 2.50$ falls outside this range. Therefore, $\\nu$ cannot be $2$.\n\nCase $2$: $\\nu = 3$.\nThis corresponds to a solute dissociating into $3$ ions (e.g., $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2$ or $\\mathrm{Na}_2\\mathrm{SO}_4$). The theoretical range for $i$ is $1 \\le i \\le 3$. Our value $i = 2.50$ is within this range. Let us calculate the corresponding degree of dissociation:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{2.50 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\frac{1.50}{2} = 0.75\n$$\nA degree of dissociation of $\\alpha = 0.75$, or $75\\%$, is a high value, which is consistent with the characterization of the solute as a \"strong electrolyte.\" The deviation from complete dissociation ($\\alpha=1$) is expected in non-ideal solutions due to inter-ionic attractions (ion pairing).\n\nCase $3$: $\\nu = 4$.\nThis corresponds to a solute dissociating into $4$ ions (e.g., $\\mathrm{FeCl}_3$). The theoretical range for $i$ is $1 \\le i \\le 4$. Our value $i = 2.50$ is within this range. The required degree of dissociation would be:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{2.50 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\frac{1.50}{3} = 0.50\n$$\nA degree of dissociation of $\\alpha = 0.50$, or $50\\%$, is significantly lower and less characteristic of a \"strong\" electrolyte, which by definition dissociates almost completely.\n\nCase $4$: $\\nu = 5$.\nThis corresponds to a solute dissociating into $5$ ions (e.g., $\\mathrm{Al}_2(\\mathrm{SO}_4)_3$). The required degree of dissociation would be:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{2.50 - 1}{5 - 1} = \\frac{1.50}{4} = 0.375\n$$\nThis value of $\\alpha$ is even lower and less plausible for a substance described as a strong electrolyte.\n\nBased on this analysis, the value $\\nu=3$ yields a degree of dissociation $\\alpha=0.75$, which is the most physically plausible scenario for a strong electrolyte under the given conditions. Higher values of $\\nu$ would imply progressively weaker dissociation, contradicting the problem statement. Therefore, the most likely integer value for $\\nu$ is $3$.\n\nThe final results are the van't Hoff factor $i = 2.50$ and the stoichiometric ion count $\\nu = 3$.",
