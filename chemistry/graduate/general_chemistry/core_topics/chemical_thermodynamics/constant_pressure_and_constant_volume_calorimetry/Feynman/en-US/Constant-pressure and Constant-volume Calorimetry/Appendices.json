            "introduction": "An accurate calorimetric measurement is impossible without a precise value for the heat capacity of the calorimeter itself, often termed the calorimeter's energy equivalent, $C_{cal}$.

            "problem": "A rigid, well-stirred bomb calorimeter is electrically calibrated using a resistive immersion heater powered by a programmable supply. The calorimeter is operated with an isothermal jacket adjusted such that, during a short heating pulse, heat exchange with the surroundings is negligible relative to the electrical energy delivered. The calorimeter is therefore effectively adiabatic over the pulse, and the pressure-volume work is zero because the volume is fixed. The goal is to determine the calorimeter energy equivalent (calorimeter heat capacity), denoted $C_{\\text{cal}}$, defined for small temperature excursions by the proportionality between the energy absorbed and the temperature rise.\n\nStarting from first principles, formulate the energy balance for the calorimeter treated as a closed system that includes the water, vessel, and immersed heater but excludes the external power supply. Use the First Law of Thermodynamics and the definition of electrical work in terms of charge transfer across an electrical potential difference to obtain a general expression for the total electrical energy delivered over a finite time interval in terms of the measurable voltage and current signals applied to the heater. Then, under the experimental conditions described above, connect this energy input to the measured temperature rise to obtain a closed-form expression for $C_{\\text{cal}}$ in terms of the time-resolved electrical signals and the observed temperature change.\n\nFor a particular calibration run, the measured heater voltage and current during the pulse of duration $0 \\le t \\le \\tau$ are modeled by\n$$V(t) = V_0 \\exp\\!\\big(-t/\\tau_e\\big), \\quad I(t) = I_0 \\exp\\!\\big(-t/\\tau_e\\big),$$\nwith $V_0 = 24.000\\ \\mathrm{V}$, $I_0 = 2.0000\\ \\mathrm{A}$, $\\tau_e = 60.00\\ \\mathrm{s}$, and $\\tau = 180.00\\ \\mathrm{s}$.

            "solution": "We begin by applying the First Law of Thermodynamics to the calorimeter, which is treated as a closed system. The differential change in internal energy, $dU$, is given by:\n$$ dU = dq + dw $$\nwhere $dq$ is the heat added to the system and $dw$ is the work done on the system.\n\nThe problem specifies several conditions for the calibration process:\n1.  The calorimeter is effectively adiabatic, so there is no heat exchange with the surroundings. Thus, $dq = 0$.\n2.  The calorimeter is a rigid bomb calorimeter, meaning its volume is constant. Consequently, the pressure-volume work is zero: $w_{PV} = -\\int p_{ext} dV = 0$.\n3.  The only work performed on the system is electrical work, $dw_{\\text{elec}}$, delivered by the immersion heater.\n\nUnder these conditions, the total work is $dw = dw_{\\text{elec}}$, and the First Law of Thermodynamics simplifies to:\n$$ dU = dw_{\\text{elec}} $$\n\nThe change in internal energy of the calorimeter system at constant volume is related to its temperature change, $dT$, by the calorimeter's energy equivalent, $C_{\\text{cal}}$. This quantity, $C_{\\text{cal}}$, is essentially the heat capacity of the entire calorimeter assembly at constant volume. For a small temperature change, we can assume $C_{\\text{cal}}$ is constant. The relationship is:\n$$ dU = C_{\\text{cal}} dT $$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $dU$ gives:\n$$ C_{\\text{cal}} dT = dw_{\\text{elec}} $$\n\nThe electrical work is done over time. The instantaneous electrical power, $P(t)$, is the product of the voltage, $V(t)$, and the current, $I(t)$. The differential of electrical work done on the system in a time interval $dt$ is:\n$$ dw_{\\text{elec}} = P(t) dt = V(t)I(t) dt $$\n\nWe can now integrate the energy balance equation over the entire duration of the electrical pulse, from time $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$.
