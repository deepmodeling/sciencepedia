It is a standard, fundamental exercise in quantum mechanics concerning the derivation of spherical harmonics from the Schrödinger equation. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information and constraints for a rigorous solution.

Substituting this into the TISE and dividing by $\\psi = RY$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R} \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{d}{d r}\\left(r^2\\frac{d R}{d r}\\right) \\right) + V(r) + \\frac{1}{Y} \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu r^2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\left(\\sin\\theta\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 Y}{\\partial \\phi^2} \\right] \\right) = E\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\frac{2\\mu r^2}{\\hbar^2}$ and rearranging to separate the radial and angular variables, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R}\\frac{d}{d r}\\left(r^2\\frac{d R}{d r}\\right) - \\frac{2\\mu r^2}{\\hbar^2}(V(r)-E) = -\\frac{1}{Y}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\left(\\sin\\theta\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial\\theta}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 Y}{\\partial\\phi^2}\\right]\n$$\nThe left-hand side depends only on $r$, and the right-hand side depends only on $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. For this equality to hold for all $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we shall call $\\lambda$.\n\nThis procedure gives the angular equation, which is derived from the right-hand side:\n$$\n-\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\left(\\sin\\theta\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial\\theta}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 Y}{\\partial\\phi^2}\\right] = \\lambda Y\n$$\nThe operator on the left is recognized as $\\frac{\\hat{L}^2}{\\hbar^2}$, where $\\hat{L}^2$ is the square of the orbital angular momentum operator. The eigenvalues of $\\hat{L}^2$ are known to be $\\hbar^2 l(l+1)$, where $l$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, a non-negative integer ($l=0, 1, 2, \\dots$). Therefore, the separation constant is $\\lambda = l(l+1)$.

Substituting this into the angular equation and multiplying by $\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{\\Theta\\Phi}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\Theta}\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left(\\sin\\theta\\frac{d\\Theta}{d\\theta}\\right) + l(l+1)\\sin^2\\theta = -\\frac{1}{\\Phi}\\frac{d^2\\Phi}{d\\phi^2}\n$$\nThe left side depends only on $\\theta$, the right side only on $\\phi$. Both must equal a constant, which we denote as $m^2$. This yields two ordinary differential equations.\n\nThe azimuthal equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\Phi}{d\\phi^2} = -m^2 \\Phi\n$$\nThe general solution is $\\Phi(\\phi) = A \\exp(im\\phi)$. The physical requirement of single-valuedness, $\\Phi(\\phi) = \\Phi(\\phi+2\\pi)$, implies that $\\exp(im2\\pi) = 1$, which constrains $m$ to be an integer ($m = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\dots$). For the specific case $m=0$, the equation becomes $\\frac{d^2\\Phi}{d\\phi^2}=0$, with solution $\\Phi(\\phi) = A_0$, a constant.\n\nThe polar equation (for $\\Theta(\\theta)$) is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left(\\sin\\theta\\frac{d\\Theta}{d\\theta}\\right) + \\left[l(l+1) - \\frac{m^2}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\right]\\Theta = 0\n$$\nThis is the associated Legendre equation. We are tasked to solve it for $l=1$ and $m=0$. Substituting these values gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left(\\sin\\theta\\frac{d\\Theta}{d\\theta}\\right) + (1(1+1) - 0)\\Theta = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}\\left(\\cos\\theta \\frac{d\\Theta}{d\\theta} + \\sin\\theta \\frac{d^2\\Theta}{d\\theta^2}\\right) + 2\\Theta = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\Theta}{d\\theta^2} + \\cot\\theta \\frac{d\\Theta}{d\\theta} + 2\\Theta = 0\n$$\nLet us test a simple solution of the form $\\Theta(\\theta) = C_1 \\cos\\theta$.\nThe derivatives are $\\frac{d\\Theta}{d\\theta} = -C_1 \\sin\\theta$ and $\\frac{d^2\\Theta}{d\\theta^2} = -C_1 \\cos\\theta$.\nSubstituting into the differential equation:\n$$\n(-C_1 \\cos\\theta) + \\cot\\theta (-C_1 \\sin\\theta) + 2(C_1 \\cos\\theta) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-C_1 \\cos\\theta - C_1 \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta} \\sin\\theta + 2C_1 \\cos\\theta = 0\n$$\n$$\n-C_1 \\cos\\theta - C_1 \\cos\\theta + 2C_1 \\cos\\theta = 0\n$$\n$$\n0 = 0\n$$\nThe solution $\\Theta(\\theta) = C_1 \\cos\\theta$ is correct. It is regular (finite) at the poles $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi$. Combining with the constant $\\Phi(\\phi)=A_0$, the unnormalized angular function is $Y_{1}^{0}(\\theta, \\phi) = N \\cos\\theta$, where $N$ is a new constant.\n\nWe normalize this function over the unit sphere. The normalization condition is $\\int |Y_{1}^{0}|^2 d\\Omega = 1$, where the element of solid angle is $d\\Omega = \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{0}^{\\pi} |N \\cos\\theta|^2 \\sin\\theta d\\theta = 1\n$$\n$$\n|N|^2 \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\cos^2\\theta \\sin\\theta d\\theta = 1\n$$\nThe integral over $\\phi$ evaluates to $2\\pi$. The integral over $\\theta$ can be solved by substitution $u=\\cos\\theta$, $du = -\\sin\\theta d\\theta$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\cos^2\\theta \\sin\\theta d\\theta = \\int_{\\cos(0)}^{\\cos(\\pi)} u^2 (-du) = \\int_{1}^{-1} -u^2 du = \\int_{-1}^{1} u^2 du = \\left[\\frac{u^3}{3}\\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{-1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe normalization condition becomes:\n$$\n|N|^2 (2\\pi) \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 1 \\implies |N|^2 = \\frac{3}{4\\pi}\n$$\nChoosing the conventional real and positive phase for $N$, we find $N = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi}}$.\nThe normalized angular function is therefore:\n$$\nY_{1}^{0}(\\theta, \\phi) = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi}} \\cos\\theta\n$$\nFinally, we identify the nodal surfaces.

For $Y_{1}^{0}$, this occurs when:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi}} \\cos\\theta = 0\n$$\nThis condition is met when $\\cos\\theta = 0$, which implies $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The surface defined by $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ in spherical coordinates corresponds to the $xy$-plane in a Cartesian system where the $z$-axis is the axis of polar symmetry.

The time derivative of $\\rho$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial t}\\psi + \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t}\n$$\nSubstituting the time derivatives from the TDSE and its conjugate:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = \\left(\\frac{1}{-i\\hbar} \\hat{H}\\psi^*\\right)\\psi + \\psi^*\\left(\\frac{1}{i\\hbar} \\hat{H}\\psi\\right) = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left( (\\hat{H}\\psi^*)\\psi - \\psi^*(\\hat{H}\\psi) \\right)\n$$\nExpanding the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left( \\left[\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu}\\nabla^2 + V\\right)\\psi^*\\right]\\psi - \\psi^*\\left[\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu}\\nabla^2 + V\\right)\\psi\\right] \\right)\n$$\nThe potential terms cancel, $V\\psi^*\\psi - \\psi^*V\\psi = 0$, leaving:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu}\\right) \\left( (\\nabla^2\\psi^*)\\psi - \\psi^*(\\nabla^2\\psi) \\right) = -\\frac{i\\hbar}{2\\mu} \\left( \\psi\\nabla^2\\psi^* - \\psi^*\\nabla^2\\psi \\right)\n$$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\cdot (A\\nabla B - B\\nabla A) = A\\nabla^2 B - B\\nabla^2 A$, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar}{2i\\mu} \\left( \\psi^*\\nabla\\psi - \\psi\\nabla\\psi^* \\right) \\right]\n$$\nComparing this with the continuity equation, we identify the probability current density $\\mathbf{j}$ as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{j}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2i\\mu} \\left( \\psi^*\\nabla\\psi - \\psi\\nabla\\psi^* \\right)\n$$\nThis can also be expressed compactly using the momentum operator $\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} = -i\\hbar\\nabla$ as $\\mathbf{j} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\text{Re}[\\psi^* \\hat{\\mathbf{p}} \\psi]$.\n\nNow, we specialize to the given stationary state wavefunction:\n$$\n\\psi_{nlm}(r,\\theta,\\phi,t) = \\psi_{nlm}(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{i E_{n}}{\\hbar} t\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\psi_{nlm}(\\mathbf{r}) = R_{nl}(r)Y_{l}^{m}(\\theta,\\phi)$.\n\nFirst, we demonstrate that the probability density $\\rho$ is time-independent for such a state.\n$$\n\\rho = |\\psi_{nlm}(r,\\theta,\\phi,t)|^2 = \\psi_{nlm}^*\\psi_{nlm} = \\left[\\psi_{nlm}^*(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\exp\\left(\\frac{i E_{n}}{\\hbar} t\\right)\\right] \\left[\\psi_{nlm}(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{i E_{n}}{\\hbar} t\\right)\\right] = |\\psi_{nlm}(\\mathbf{r})|^2\n$$\nThe time-dependent exponential factors cancel, proving that $\\rho$ is constant in time, which is the defining characteristic of a stationary state.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\mathbf{j}$ for this state. The time-dependent factors also cancel in the expression for $\\mathbf{j}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{j} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2i\\mu} \\left( \\psi_{nlm}^*(\\mathbf{r})\\nabla\\psi_{nlm}(\\mathbf{r}) - \\psi_{nlm}(\\mathbf{r})\\nabla\\psi_{nlm}^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\right)\n$$\nThe current $\\mathbf{j}$ can be nonzero if the spatial part of the wavefunction, $\\psi_{nlm}(\\mathbf{r})$, is intrinsically complex. The spherical harmonic $Y_l^m(\\theta, \\phi)$ contains a factor of $\\exp(im\\phi)$.\n$$\nY_l^m(\\theta, \\phi) = C_{lm} P_l^{|m|}(\\cos\\theta) \\exp(im\\phi)\n$$\nwhere $P_l^{|m|}$ is an associated Legendre polynomial and $C_{lm}$ is a real normalization constant. Since the radial function $R_{nl}(r)$ is real, the complexity of $\\psi_{nlm}(\\mathbf{r})$ arises entirely from the $\\exp(im\\phi)$ term. Let us write $\\psi_{nlm}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\chi(r, \\theta) \\exp(im\\phi)$, where $\\chi(r, \\theta) = R_{nl}(r) C_{lm} P_l^{|m|}(\\cos\\theta)$ is a real function.\n\nThe problem asks for the azimuthal component $v_\\phi = j_\\phi / \\rho$. The component $j_\\phi$ is the projection of $\\mathbf{j}$ onto the azimuthal unit vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}$. In spherical coordinates, the $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}$ component of the gradient operator is $\\frac{1}{r\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}$.\n$$\nj_\\phi = \\mathbf{j} \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2i\\mu} \\left(\\psi_{nlm}^* (\\nabla\\psi_{nlm})\\cdot\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} - \\psi_{nlm} (\\nabla\\psi_{nlm}^*)\\cdot\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nj_\\phi = \\frac{\\hbar}{2i\\mu r\\sin\\theta} \\left(\\psi_{nlm}^* \\frac{\\partial\\psi_{nlm}}{\\partial\\phi} - \\psi_{nlm} \\frac{\\partial\\psi_{nlm}^*}{\\partial\\phi} \\right)\n$$\nWe compute the derivatives with respect to $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\psi_{nlm}}{\\partial\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}[\\chi(r,\\theta)\\exp(im\\phi)] = im\\,\\chi(r,\\theta)\\exp(im\\phi) = im\\,\\psi_{nlm}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\psi_{nlm}^*}{\\partial\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}[\\chi(r,\\theta)\\exp(-im\\phi)] = -im\\,\\chi(r,\\theta)\\exp(-im\\phi) = -im\\,\\psi_{nlm}^*\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $j_\\phi$:\n$$\nj_\\phi = \\frac{\\hbar}{2i\\mu r\\sin\\theta} \\left( \\psi_{nlm}^* (im\\,\\psi_{nlm}) - \\psi_{nlm} (-im\\,\\psi_{nlm}^*) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nj_\\phi = \\frac{\\hbar}{2i\\mu r\\sin\\theta} \\left( im\\,|\\psi_{nlm}|^2 + im\\,|\\psi_{nlm}|^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar(2im)}{2i\\mu r\\sin\\theta} |\\psi_{nlm}|^2\n$$\nThe imaginary units cancel. Recognizing that $|\\psi_{nlm}|^2 = \\rho$, we get:\n$$\nj_\\phi = \\frac{\\hbar m \\rho}{\\mu r\\sin\\theta}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that for $m \\neq 0$, the spatial phase gradient $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}\\exp(im\\phi)$ generates a persistent, non-zero azimuthal probability current, even in a stationary state. If $m=0$, the wavefunction is real, and the current $\\mathbf{j}$ is zero everywhere.\n\nThe local velocity field is defined as $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{j}/\\rho$. Its azimuthal component is $v_\\phi = j_\\phi/\\rho$.\n$$\nv_{\\phi}(r,\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar m \\rho}{\\mu r\\sin\\theta} \\right)\n$$\nThus, the final expression for the azimuthal component of the local velocity field is:\n$$\nv_{\\phi}(r,\\theta) = \\frac{\\hbar m}{\\mu r \\sin\\theta}\n$$\nThis result is independent of the principal quantum number $n$ and the orbital quantum number $l$ (except through the requirement that $|m| \\leq l$), and depends on the spatial coordinates $r$ and $\\theta$. The velocity diverges on the $z$-axis ($\\theta=0, \\pi$), where the coordinate system is singular and the probability density for $m \\neq 0$ is zero. It also diverges at the origin ($r=0$). This is a known feature of this simplified model of intra-atomic electron motion.",
