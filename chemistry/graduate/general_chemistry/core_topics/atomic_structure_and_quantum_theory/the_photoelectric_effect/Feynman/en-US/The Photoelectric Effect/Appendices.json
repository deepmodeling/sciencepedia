This exercise explores such a scenario, where the work function $\\phi$ of a material is not constant but changes linearly along its surface. By applying the fundamental energy-conservation principle of the photoelectric effect, you will determine the spatial limits of photoemission, a skill essential for designing and characterizing position-sensitive photodetectors and graded materials.
