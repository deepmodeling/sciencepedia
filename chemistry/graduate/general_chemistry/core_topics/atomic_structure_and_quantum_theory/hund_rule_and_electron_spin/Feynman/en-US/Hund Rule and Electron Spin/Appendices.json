This foundational exercise guides you through the process of deriving all allowed spectroscopic terms for two equivalent $p$-electrons, a configuration denoted as $p^2$. By applying the Pauli exclusion principle and the rules of angular momentum addition, you will build the complete set of term symbols from first principles, providing a crucial underpinning for understanding atomic structure .",

Starting from first principles, use the indistinguishability of electrons, the Pauli exclusion principle, and angular momentum addition rules to determine the allowed total orbital angular momentum $L$ and total spin $S$ values for this $p^2$ configuration by the method of equivalent electrons. Then, validate your result by an explicit microstate enumeration based on counting distinct two-electron spin-orbitals and their exchange symmetries.

Express your final answer as a single integer with no units and no rounding.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of all allowed Russell-Saunders (LS) terms for a $p^2$ electronic configuration, where two equivalent electrons occupy a subshell with orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$. The solution must be derived from first principles, validated by an independent method, and concluded with a calculation of the total number of microstates.\n\nFor two equivalent electrons, the principal quantum numbers are identical, $n_1 = n_2$, and the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are identical, $l_1 = l_2 = 1$. The total wavefunction, $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$, must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of the two electrons, as dictated by the Pauli exclusion principle. In the LS coupling scheme, the total wavefunction can be approximated as a product of a spatial part and a spin part: $\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = \\psi_{\\text{spatial}} \\times \\chi_{\\text{spin}}$. For $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$ to be antisymmetric, one of the factors must be symmetric and the other antisymmetric with respect to particle exchange.\n\nFirst, let us determine the possible values for the total orbital angular momentum, $L$, and total spin, $S$.\nFor two electrons, each with spin $s = \\frac{1}{2}$, the total spin quantum number $S$ is given by the addition of their angular momenta: $S$ can take values from $|s_1 - s_2|$ to $s_1 + s_2$ in integer steps.\n$$\nS \\in \\left\\{ \\left|\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right|, \\dots, \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\} = \\{0, 1\\}\n$$\nThe spin state with $S=1$ is a triplet, which is symmetric under electron exchange. The spin state with $S=0$ is a singlet, which is antisymmetric under electron exchange.\n\nFor two $p$-electrons, each with orbital angular momentum $l=1$, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ is given by:\n$$\nL \\in \\{ |1-1|, \\dots, 1+1 \\} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}\n$$\nThese correspond to $S$, $P$, and $D$ terms, respectively.\n\nThe symmetry of the spatial part of the wavefunction, $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}$, for two equivalent electrons with individual orbital angular momentum $l$ coupled to a total $L$, is given by the factor $(-1)^{L}$.\n- For $L=0$ (S term), the spatial part is symmetric ($(-1)^0 = 1$).\n- For $L=1$ (P term), the spatial part is antisymmetric ($(-1)^1 = -1$).\n- For $L=2$ (D term), the spatial part is symmetric ($(-1)^2 = 1$).\n\nWe now combine the spatial and spin parts to form a total wavefunction that is antisymmetric:\n1.  **Symmetric $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}$ and Antisymmetric $\\chi_{\\text{spin}}$**:\n    -   Symmetric spatial wavefunctions correspond to $L=0$ and $L=2$.\n    -   The antisymmetric spin wavefunction corresponds to the singlet state, $S=0$.\n    -   This combination yields the terms where $(L, S) = (0, 0)$ and $(L, S) = (2, 0)$. In spectroscopic notation, these are the $^1S$ and $^1D$ terms.\n\n2.  **Antisymmetric $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}$ and Symmetric $\\chi_{\\text{spin}}$**:\n    -   The antisymmetric spatial wavefunction corresponds to $L=1$.\n    -   The symmetric spin wavefunction corresponds to the triplet state, $S=1$.\n    -   This combination yields the term where $(L, S) = (1, 1)$. This is the $^3P$ term.\n\nTherefore, the allowed LS terms for the $p^2$ configuration are $^1S$, $^1D$, and $^3P$.\n\nTo validate this result, we perform an enumeration of all possible microstates. For a $p$ subshell ($l=1$), there are $2l+1 = 3$ spatial orbitals ($m_l = -1, 0, 1$). Including spin ($m_s = \\pm\\frac{1}{2}$), there are $2(2l+1)=6$ available spin-orbitals. The total number of ways to place two indistinguishable electrons into these $6$ spin-orbitals, without two electrons occupying the same spin-orbital, is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\n\\text{Total microstates} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n$$\nEach microstate is characterized by the total projection of orbital angular momentum, $M_L = \\sum m_{li}$, and the total projection of spin angular momentum, $M_S = \\sum m_{si}$. By enumerating all $15$ distinct microstates, we can construct a table of counts for each $(M_L, M_S)$ pair:\n\n```\n+----------------+----+---+---+\n| M_L \\ M_S      | -1 | 0 | 1 |\n+----------------+----+---+---+\n|  2             |  0 | 1 | 0 |\n|  1             |  1 | 2 | 1 |\n|  0             |  1 | 3 | 1 |\n| -1             |  1 | 2 | 1 |\n| -2             |  0 | 1 | 0 |\n+----------------+----+---+---+\n```\n\nWe now decompose this table to identify the LS terms:\n-   The highest value of $M_L$ is $2$. It appears only with $M_S=0$. This indicates the presence of a term with $L=2$ and $S=0$, which is a $^1D$ term. A $^1D$ term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (5)(1) = 5$ microstates, one for each $M_L \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$ at $M_S=0$. Subtracting these $5$ states leaves a table of remaining microstates.\n-   In the remaining table, the highest $M_L$ is $1$. It appears with $M_S \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. This rectangular block of states indicates a term with $L=1$ and $S=1$, which is a $^3P$ term. A $^3P$ term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (3)(3) = 9$ microstates, corresponding to all combinations of $M_L \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and $M_S \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n-   After removing the $^1D$ and $^3P$ states, the only remaining microstate is $(M_L, M_S) = (0, 0)$. This corresponds to a term with $L=0$ and $S=0$, which is a $^1S$ term. This term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (1)(1) = 1$ microstate.\n\nThe microstate enumeration confirms that the allowed terms are indeed $^1S$, $^1D$, and $^3P$.\n\nFinally, we compute the total number of microstates accounted for by these allowed LS terms. This is the sum of their degeneracies:\n-   Degeneracy of $^1S$ ($L=0, S=0$): $(2 \\cdot 0 + 1)(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n-   Degeneracy of $^3P$ ($L=1, S=1$): $(2 \\cdot 1 + 1)(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n-   Degeneracy of $^1D$ ($L=2, S=0$): $(2 \\cdot 2 + 1)(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) = 5 \\times 1 = 5$.\n\nThe total number of microstates is the sum of these degeneracies:\n$$\n\\text{Total Microstates} = 1 + 9 + 5 = 15\n$$\nThis sum correctly matches the total number of microstates calculated from the combinatorial formula $\\binom{6}{2}=15$. The calculation is self-consistent and validated.",

            "solution": "The determination of the lowest-energy (ground) term symbol follows a set of rules established by Friedrich Hund, which are a direct consequence of the quantum mechanical treatment of electron-electron repulsion and spin-orbit interaction within the $LS$ coupling approximation.\n\nA $p$-subshell has an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$.

The total capacity of a $p$-subshell is $2(2l+1) = 6$ electrons.\n\nWe apply Hund's rules sequentially for each configuration $p^n$.\n1.  **Hund's First Rule (Maximization of Spin Multiplicity):** The term with the maximum possible value of total spin $S$ has the lowest energy. This is achieved by placing electrons into different orbitals with parallel spins for as long as the Pauli exclusion principle permits.\n2.  **Hund's Second Rule (Maximization of Total Orbital Angular Momentum):** For a given value of $S$, the term with the maximum possible value of total orbital angular momentum $L$ has the lowest energy. This is achieved by filling orbitals with the highest $m_l$ values first.\n3.  **Hund's Third Rule (Determination of Total Angular Momentum):** For a given term (fixed $S$ and $L$), the energy ordering of the levels, characterized by the total angular momentum quantum number $J$, depends on the subshell filling. $J$ takes values from $|L-S|$ to $L+S$ in integer steps.\n    - For a subshell that is less than half-filled ($n < 2l+1$), the level with the minimum value of $J$ has the lowest energy.\n    - For a subshell that is more than half-filled ($n > 2l+1$), the level with the maximum value of $J$ has the lowest energy.\n    - For a half-filled subshell ($n = 2l+1$), $L=0$ and there is only one possible $J$ value, $J=S$.\n\nWe now analyze each configuration:\n\n**Case $p^1$ ($n=1$):**\n- One electron. Its spin is $s=1/2$, so the total spin must be $S=1/2$. The spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2(1/2)+1 = 2$.\n- The electron is in an $l=1$ orbital, so the total orbital angular momentum is $L=1$. The letter code for $L=1$ is P.\n- The term is $^2P$.\n- For $S=1/2$ and $L=1$, the possible $J$ values are $J = |1 - 1/2|, 1 + 1/2$, so $J \\in \\{1/2, 3/2\\}$.\n- The subshell is less than half-filled ($1 < 3$). Hund's third rule dictates that the minimum $J$ value corresponds to the lowest energy.\n- The ground term is $^2P_{1/2}$.\n\n**Case $p^2$ ($n=2$):**\n- To maximize $S$, we place the two electrons in different orbitals with parallel spins. For instance, in $m_l=+1$ and $m_l=0$, both with $m_s=+1/2$. Total spin is $S = 1/2+1/2 = 1$. Multiplicity is $2(1)+1 = 3$.\n- To maximize $L$ for this $S=1$ state, we place the electrons in the orbitals that maximize $M_L = \\sum m_l$. With parallel spins, they must occupy different orbitals. The combination is $\\{m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\} = \\{+1, 0\\}$, which gives a maximum $M_L = 1+0=1$. Thus, $L=1$. The letter code is P.\n- The ground term is $^3P$.\n- For $S=1$ and $L=1$, the possible $J$ values are $J = |1-1|, ..., 1+1$, so $J \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n- The subshell is less than half-filled ($2 < 3$). The minimum $J$ value gives the lowest energy.\n- The ground term is $^3P_0$.\n\n**Case $p^3$ ($n=3$):**\n- To maximize $S$, we place one electron in each of the three orbitals ($m_l=+1, 0, -1$) with parallel spins ($m_s=+1/2$). This gives $S = 1/2+1/2+1/2 = 3/2$. Multiplicity is $2(3/2)+1 = 4$.\n- The total magnetic orbital quantum number for this configuration is $M_L = (+1) + (0) + (-1) = 0$. Since this is the only arrangement that gives $S=3/2$, the maximum $L$ for this multiplicity must be $L=0$. The letter code is S.\n- The ground term is $^4S$.\n- For $S=3/2$ and $L=0$, the only possible $J$ value is $J = |0 - 3/2| = 3/2$.\n- The subshell is exactly half-filled ($3 = 3$). Hund's third rule is not required for selection as only one $J$ value exists.\n- The ground term is $^4S_{3/2}$.\n\n**Case $p^4$ ($n=4$):**\n- This configuration can be treated as having $6-4=2$ holes in a filled shell. The resulting terms are the same as for $p^2$, but the fine structure splitting is inverted. The ground term will be a $^3P$ term.\n- Derivation: To maximize $S$, we first half-fill the subshell with three electrons with parallel spin, then add the fourth electron with opposite spin. Configuration: $\\{m_l=+1, m_s=\\pm 1/2\\}$, $\\{m_l=0, m_s=+1/2\\}$, $\\{m_l=-1, m_s=+1/2\\}$.\n- Total spin is $S = (1/2-1/2) + 1/2 + 1/2 = 1$. Multiplicity is $3$.\n- To maximize $L$ for $S=1$, we pair the electron in the orbital that minimizes the loss of $L$. We want to keep electrons in high $m_l$ orbitals. The configuration with maximum $M_L$ for $S=1$ is $(m_l=+1, \\uparrow\\downarrow), (m_l=0, \\uparrow), (m_l=-1, \\uparrow)$. Thus $M_L = 2(+1) + 1(0) + 1(-1) = 1$. So $L=1$, which is a P term.\n- The ground term is $^3P$.\n- The possible $J$ values are $J \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n- The subshell is more than half-filled ($4 > 3$). Hund's third rule dictates that the maximum $J$ value corresponds to the lowest energy.\n- The ground term is $^3P_2$.\n\n**Case $p^5$ ($n=5$):**\n- This configuration corresponds to one hole in a filled shell, so its terms are identical to $p^1$, but with inverted fine structure. The ground term will be a $^2P$ term.\n- Derivation: Five electrons will fill two orbitals and half-fill the third. Configuration: $\\{m_l=+1, \\uparrow\\downarrow\\}, \\{m_l=0, \\uparrow\\downarrow\\}, \\{m_l=-1, \\uparrow\\}$.\n- Total spin is $S=1/2$. Multiplicity is $2$.\n- Total $M_L = 2(+1) + 2(0) + 1(-1) = 1$. So $L=1$, which is a P term.\n- The ground term is $^2P$.\n- The possible $J$ values are $J \\in \\{1/2, 3/2\\}$.\n- The subshell is more than half-filled ($5 > 3$).

Determining the sign of the spin-orbit constant $A$ from this ordering.\n3.  Comparing these findings with the prediction of Hund's third rule.\n\n**1. Inference of Experimental Energy Ordering**\n\nThe problem states that the observed spectral lines are *emission* lines. In spectroscopy, an emission line results from a transition of an atom from a state of higher energy to a state of lower energy, with the energy difference released as a photon.\n\n- The first transition is $^{3}P_{1}\\to {}^{3}P_{2}$. Since this is an emission, the initial state $^{3}P_{1}$ must have a higher energy than the final state $^{3}P_{2}$. This gives the inequality: $E(^{3}P_{1}) > E(^{3}P_{2})$.\n- The second transition is $^{3}P_{0}\\to {}^{3}P_{1}$. Similarly, the initial state $^{3}P_{0}$ must have a higher energy than the final state $^{3}P_{1}$. This gives the inequality: $E(^{3}P_{0}) > E(^{3}P_{1})$.\n\nCombining these two inequalities, we establish a complete ordering of the energy levels:\n$$E(^{3}P_{0}) > E(^{3}P_{1}) > E(^{3}P_{2})$$\nThis type of multiplet, where the energy increases as the total angular momentum quantum number $J$ decreases, is known as an **inverted multiplet**. The ground state (the level with the lowest energy) is $^{3}P_{2}$.\n\n**2. Determination of the Sign of the Spin-Orbit Constant $A$**\n\nWithin the Russell-Saunders ($LS$) coupling approximation, the spin-orbit interaction perturbs the energy of a term. The energy correction, $E_{SO}$, for a state with quantum numbers $L$, $S$, and $J$ is given by the expectation value of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_{SO} = A \\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{S}$. This energy is:\n$$E_{SO}(J) = \\frac{A}{2} [J(J+1) - L(L+1) - S(S+1)]$$\nFor the $^{3}P$ term of oxygen:\n- The multiplicity $2S+1=3$ implies a total spin quantum number $S=1$.\n- The term symbol 'P' implies a total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L=1$.\n- The possible values for $J$ are $|L-S|, \\dots, L+S$, which are $|1-1|, \\dots, 1+1$, giving $J=0, 1, 2$.\n\nThe experimental ordering is $E(J=2) < E(J=1) < E(J=0)$. This means that the energy of the levels decreases as $J$ increases. The energy's dependence on $J$ is given by $\\frac{A}{2}J(J+1)$. Since $J(J+1)$ is a monotonically increasing function for non-negative $J$, the only way for the overall energy to decrease with increasing $J$ is if the constant of proportionality, $A$, is negative. Therefore, $A < 0$.\n\n**3. Comparison with Hund's Third Rule**\n\nHund's third rule concerns the energy ordering of the $J$-levels within a ground term:\n- For a subshell that is **less than half-filled**, the level with the lowest $J$ value has the lowest energy (a \"normal\" multiplet, corresponding to $A>0$).\n- For a subshell that is **more than half-filled**, the level with the highest $J$ value has the lowest energy (an \"inverted\" multiplet, corresponding to $A<0$).\n\nThe oxygen atom has the configuration $1s^2\\,2s^2\\,2p^4$. The outermost subshell is $2p^4$. A $p$-subshell ($l=1$) can contain a maximum of $2(2l+1) = 6$ electrons. A half-filled $p$-subshell contains $3$ electrons. Since the $2p$ subshell of oxygen contains $4$ electrons, it is **more than half-filled**.\n\nAccording to Hund's third rule, for a more than half-filled subshell, the level with the highest $J$ value should be the lowest in energy. For the $^{3}P_J$ term, the possible $J$ values are $0, 1, 2$. The highest value is $J=2$. Therefore, Hund's third rule predicts that the $^{3}P_2$ level has the lowest energy, leading to the ordering:\n$$E(^{3}P_{2}) < E(^{3}P_{1}) < E(^{3}P_{0})$$\nThis predicted inverted multiplet structure implies that the spin-orbit constant $A$ should be negative ($A<0$).\n\nThe conclusion from the experimental data ($E(^{3}P_{2}) < E(^{3}P_{1}) < E(^{3}P_{0})$ and $A<0$) is in perfect **agreement** with the prediction from Hund's third rule for the $2p^4$ configuration.\n\nThis analysis confirms that Option A is the only correct statement.",
