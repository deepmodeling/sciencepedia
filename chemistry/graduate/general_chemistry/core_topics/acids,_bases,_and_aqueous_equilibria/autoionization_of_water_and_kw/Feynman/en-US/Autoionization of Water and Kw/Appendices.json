Thus, Model B is a three-parameter model ($k=3$).\n\n**Computational Methodology**\n\nFor each dataset, temperatures given in degrees Celsius ($T_{^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}}$) are converted to Kelvin ($T_{\\mathrm{K}}$) using $T_{\\mathrm{K}} = T_{^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} + 273.15$. The regression models are fitted using ordinary least squares (OLS). For a model of the form $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, the OLS estimate of the parameter vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}$.\n\nFor Model A, $pK_{\\mathrm{w}}(T) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (1/T)$, the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}_A$ for $n$ data points is:\n$$\\mathbf{X}_A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/T_1 \\\\ 1 & 1/T_2 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & 1/T_n \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFor Model B, $pK_{\\mathrm{w}}(T) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (1/T) + \\beta_2 \\ln T$, the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}_B$ is:\n$$\\mathbf{X}_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/T_1 & \\ln T_1 \\\\ 1 & 1/T_2 & \\ln T_2 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & 1/T_n & \\ln T_n \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe performance and complexity of the models are evaluated using:\n1.  **Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE)**: $\\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - \\hat{y}_{i})^{2}}$, where $y_i$ are the observed $pK_{\\mathrm{w}}$ values and $\\hat{y}_i$ are the model predictions.\n2.  **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**: $\\mathrm{AIC} = n \\ln(\\frac{\\mathrm{RSS}}{n}) + 2k$, where $\\mathrm{RSS} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - \\hat{y}_{i})^{2}$ is the residual sum of squares and $k$ is the number of fitted parameters ($k_A=2$, $k_B=3$).\n\nModel A (the simpler model) is declared adequate if $\\mathrm{AIC}_{A} \\le \\mathrm{AIC}_{B} + 2$. This criterion balances the goodness of fit with model parsimony, penalizing the additional parameter in Model B unless it provides a sufficiently large improvement in fit.",
