            "problem": "A sparingly soluble, symmetric electrolyte $MX$ crystallizes as a fully dissociated $1{:}1$ salt according to the dissolution reaction $MX(s) \\rightleftharpoons M^{+}(aq) + X^{-}(aq)$. At temperature $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the thermodynamic solubility product constant $K_{sp}$ for this reaction is $K_{sp} = 3.70 \\times 10^{-6}$. The solution contains an inert background electrolyte that fixes the ionic strength at $I = 0.050$, and the contribution of the dissolving salt $MX$ to $I$ is negligible. Treat the activity of the solid as unity, and take the standard concentration as $c^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$ so that activities of solutes are $a_{i} = \\gamma_{i}\\,[i]/c^{\\circ}$. The Debye–Hückel limiting law holds under these conditions, with $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{i} = -A z_{i}^{2}\\sqrt{I}$ and $A = 0.509$ for water at $298\\ \\mathrm{K}$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and well-posed. All necessary data and definitions are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution based on fundamental principles of chemical thermodynamics. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe dissolution of the sparingly soluble salt $MX$ is described by the equilibrium:\n$$MX(s) \\rightleftharpoons M^{+}(aq) + X^{-}(aq)$$\nThe condition for chemical equilibrium is the equality of the chemical potentials of the reactants and products. For this reaction, the condition is:\n$$\\mu_{MX(s)} = \\mu_{M^{+}(aq)} + \\mu_{X^{-}(aq)}$$\nThe chemical potential $\\mu_i$ of a species $i$ is related to its standard chemical potential $\\mu_i^{\\circ}$ and its activity $a_i$ by the expression $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_i$, where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Substituting this into the equilibrium condition yields:\n$$\\mu_{MX(s)}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{MX(s)} = (\\mu_{M^{+}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{M^{+}}) + (\\mu_{X^{-}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{X^{-}})$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{a_{M^{+}} a_{X^{-}}}{a_{MX(s)}} \\right) = \\mu_{MX(s)}^{\\circ} - \\mu_{M^{+}}^{\\circ} - \\mu_{X^{-}}^{\\circ} = -\\Delta_r G^{\\circ}$$\nwhere $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ}$ is the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction. The standard Gibbs free energy is related to the thermodynamic equilibrium constant $K_{sp}$ by $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K_{sp}$. Therefore, we have:\n$$RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{a_{M^{+}} a_{X^{-}}}{a_{MX(s)}} \\right) = RT \\ln K_{sp}$$\nThis simplifies to the definition of the thermodynamic solubility product:\n$$K_{sp} = \\frac{a_{M^{+}} a_{X^{-}}}{a_{MX(s)}}$$\nThe problem states that the activity of the solid phase is unity, $a_{MX(s)} = 1$. The expression becomes:\n$$K_{sp} = a_{M^{+}} a_{X^{-}}$$\nThe activity of an aqueous solute $i$ is defined as $a_{i} = \\gamma_{i}\\,[i]/c^{\\circ}$, where $\\gamma_i$ is its activity coefficient, $[i]$ is its molar concentration, and $c^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$ is the standard concentration. Let $s$ be the molar solubility of $MX$ in $\\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$. For the $1{:}1$ electrolyte, the dissolution stoichiometry implies that at equilibrium, $[M^{+}] = s$ and $[X^{-}] = s$. Substituting these into the expression for $K_{sp}$:\n$$K_{sp} = \\left( \\gamma_{M^{+}}\\frac{s}{c^{\\circ}} \\right) \\left( \\gamma_{X^{-}}\\frac{s}{c^{\\circ}} \\right) = \\gamma_{M^{+}}\\gamma_{X^{-}}\\left(\\frac{s}{c^{\\circ}}\\right)^2$$\nWe define the mean ionic activity coefficient $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ for a $1{:}1$ electrolyte as $\\gamma_{\\pm} = \\sqrt{\\gamma_{M^{+}}\\gamma_{X^{-}}}$. The expression for $K_{sp}$ is then:\n$$K_{sp} = \\gamma_{\\pm}^2 \\left(\\frac{s}{c^{\\circ}}\\right)^2$$\nSolving for the molar solubility $s$, we obtain the general expression:\n$$s = c^{\\circ} \\frac{\\sqrt{K_{sp}}}{\\gamma_{\\pm}}$$\nSince $c^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$, the numerical value of $s$ in units of $\\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$ is given by $\\frac{\\sqrt{K_{sp}}}{\\gamma_{\\pm}}$.\n\nFirst, we consider the ideal assumption. In an ideal solution, all activity coefficients are unity by definition. Thus, $\\gamma_{M^{+}} = 1$, $\\gamma_{X^{-}} = 1$, and $\\gamma_{\\pm} = 1$. The ideal solubility, $s_{\\text{ideal}}$, is:\n$$s_{\\text{ideal}} = c^{\\circ} \\sqrt{K_{sp}}$$\nUsing the given value $K_{sp} = 3.70 \\times 10^{-6}$:\n$$s_{\\text{ideal}} = (1\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}) \\sqrt{3.70 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 1.9235 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$$\n\nSecond, we consider the activity-corrected solubility, $s_{I}$, at a fixed ionic strength $I = 0.050$. We must calculate the mean ionic activity coefficient $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ using the Debye–Hückel limiting law:\n$$\\log_{10}\\gamma_{i} = -A z_{i}^{2}\\sqrt{I}$$\nFor the cation $M^{+}$ with charge $z_{M^{+}} = +1$:\n$$\\log_{10}\\gamma_{M^{+}} = -(0.509)(+1)^2\\sqrt{0.050}$$\nFor the anion $X^{-}$ with charge $z_{X^{-}} = -1$:\n$$\\log_{10}\\gamma_{X^{-}} = -(0.509)(-1)^2\\sqrt{0.050}$$\nSince the charge magnitudes are identical, $\\gamma_{M^{+}} = \\gamma_{X^{-}}$. Consequently, the mean ionic activity coefficient is $\\gamma_{\\pm} = \\gamma_{M^{+}} = \\gamma_{X^{-}}$.\nWe calculate the numerical value of $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm}$:\n$$\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm} = -(0.509)\\sqrt{0.050} \\approx -(0.509)(0.223607) \\approx -0.113816$$\nNow, we find $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ by taking the antilogarithm:\n$$\\gamma_{\\pm} = 10^{-0.113816} \\approx 0.76946$$\nAs expected for a solution with non-zero ionic strength, the activity coefficient is less than unity. The activity-corrected solubility $s_{I}$ is then:\n$$s_{I} = \\frac{s_{\\text{ideal}}}{\\gamma_{\\pm}} = \\frac{1.9235 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}}{0.76946} \\approx 2.4998 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$$\nThe presence of an inert electrolyte screens the electrostatic attraction between the dissolving ions, thus increasing the solubility relative to the ideal case. This is the salt effect.\n\nFinally, we compute the fractional change in solubility, $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta \\equiv \\frac{s_{I} - s_{\\text{ideal}}}{s_{\\text{ideal}}}$$\nSubstituting the relationship $s_I = s_{\\text{ideal}}/\\gamma_{\\pm}$:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{s_{\\text{ideal}}/\\gamma_{\\pm} - s_{\\text{ideal}}}{s_{\\text{ideal}}} = \\frac{s_{\\text{ideal}}(1/\\gamma_{\\pm} - 1)}{s_{\\text{ideal}}} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{\\pm}} - 1$$\nUsing our calculated value for $\\gamma_{\\pm}$:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{1}{0.76946} - 1 \\approx 1.29960 - 1 = 0.29960$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we obtain $\\Delta = 0.2996$.",

            "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in aqueous equilibrium chemistry, requiring a rigorous, non-approximative solution. My validation concludes that the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique, physically meaningful solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is a saturated solution of a sparingly soluble hydroxide, $M(OH)_2(s)$, in pure water at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The relevant chemical equilibria are the dissolution of the solid and the autoionization of water.\n\nThe chemical species present in the aqueous phase are the solvent, $H_2O(l)$, and the dissolved ions: the metal cation $M^{2+}(aq)$, the hydroxide ion $OH^-(aq)$, and the hydronium ion $H^+(aq)$. We seek the equilibrium concentrations of these ions: $[M^{2+}]$, $[OH^-]$, and $[H^+]$. To solve for these three unknowns, a system of three independent equations is required. These equations are derived from fundamental principles of equilibrium and mass and charge balance.\n\nThe governing equations are as follows:\n\n1.  **Solubility Product Equilibrium**: The dissolution of the solid $M(OH)_2(s)$ is described by the reaction:\n    $$M(OH)_2(s) \\rightleftharpoons M^{2+}(aq) + 2OH^-(aq)$$\n    The equilibrium expression for this process is given by the solubility product constant, $K_{sp}$:\n    $$K_{sp} = [M^{2+}][OH^-]^2 \\quad (\\text{Equation } 1)$$\n\n2.  **Water Autoionization Equilibrium**: Water undergoes autoionization according to the reaction:\n    $$H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$$\n    The equilibrium for this reaction is governed by the ion product of water, $K_{w}$, which at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is given as $1.0\\times 10^{-14}$.\n    $$K_{w} = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0\\times 10^{-14} \\quad (\\text{Equation } 2)$$\n\n3.  **Charge Balance (Electroneutrality Principle)**: The solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of the molar concentrations of positive charges must equal the sum of the molar concentrations of negative charges. The ions contributing to charge are $M^{2+}$, $H^+$, and $OH^-$.\n    $$2[M^{2+}] + [H^+] = [OH^-] \\quad (\\text{Equation } 3)$$\n    The coefficient $2$ for $[M^{2+}]$ arises from the $+2$ charge of the metal cation.\n\nThis system of three equations is complete and sufficient to solve for the three unknown concentrations. The problem demands a solution without simplifying assumptions, such as assuming $[OH^-] \\gg [H^+]$. We will therefore combine these equations into a single equation for one variable. Let us choose $[OH^-]$ as the master variable, as it appears in all three equations.\n\nFrom Equation $1$, we can express $[M^{2+}]$ in terms of $[OH^-]$:\n$$[M^{2+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^2}$$\n\nFrom Equation $2$, we can express $[H^+]$ in terms of $[OH^-]$:\n$$[H^+] = \\frac{K_{w}}{[OH^-]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $[M^{2+}]$ and $[H^+]$ into the charge balance equation (Equation $3$):\n$$2\\left(\\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^2}\\right) + \\frac{K_{w}}{[OH^-]} = [OH^-]$$\n\nTo eliminate the denominators, we multiply the entire equation by $[OH^-]^2$, assuming $[OH^-] \\neq 0$, which is physically necessary.\n$$2K_{sp} + K_{w}[OH^-] = [OH^-]^3$$\n\nRearranging this into a standard polynomial form, we obtain a cubic equation in the variable $[OH^-]$:\n$$[OH^-]^3 - K_{w}[OH^-] - 2K_{sp} = 0$$\n\nLet $x = [OH^-]$. The equation is $f(x) = x^3 - K_{w}x - 2K_{sp} = 0$. For a solution to be physically meaningful, the root $x$ must be real and positive. We can analyze the function $f(x)$ for $x > 0$. At $x=0$, $f(0) = -2K_{sp} < 0$. The derivative is $f'(x) = 3x^2 - K_{w}$. There is a local minimum at $x = \\sqrt{K_{w}/3}$, where the function's value is negative. As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) \\to \\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist exactly one positive real root for $x$. This confirms that our formulation is well-posed and will yield a unique physical solution for $[OH^-]$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1.  For each given value of $K_{sp}$, construct the coefficients of the cubic polynomial $x^3 + 0x^2 - K_{w}x - 2K_{sp} = 0$.\n2.  Solve this polynomial equation numerically to find its roots.\n3.  Select the single unique positive real root, which corresponds to the equilibrium concentration $[OH^-]$.\n4.  Calculate the remaining quantities using the value of $[OH^-]$:\n    -   $[M^{2+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^2}$\n    -   $[H^+] = \\frac{K_{w}}{[OH^-]}$\n    -   $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([H^+])$\n5.  Report the final values for $([M^{2+}], [OH^-], \\mathrm{pH})$, rounded to six significant figures as specified.\n\nThis rigorous method avoids any potentially invalid simplifying assumptions and is applicable across a wide range of $K_{sp}$ values, including those where the contribution of water autoionization to the hydroxide concentration is significant.",

Compute the fixed quantities:\n$$\n[OH^{-}] = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M},\\quad K_{sp} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-17},\\quad K_{f} = 1.0 \\times 10^{8},\\quad C_M^{\\mathrm{T}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}.\n$$\nThe saturation free metal concentration is\n$$\ns_0 = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^{-}]^{2}} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-17}}{\\left(1.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\right)^{2}} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-17}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-10}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}.\n$$\nThen\n$$\nC_M^{\\mathrm{T}} - s_0 = 1.00 \\times 10^{-5} - 3.0 \\times 10^{-7} = 9.70 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M},\n$$\n$$\nK_{f}\\,s_0 = \\left(1.0 \\times 10^{8}\\right)\\left(3.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\right) = 3.0 \\times 10^{1} = 30.\n$$\nHence\n$$\n\\frac{C_M^{\\mathrm{T}} - s_0}{K_{f}\\,s_0} = \\frac{9.70 \\times 10^{-6}}{30} \\approx 3.23 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M},\n$$\nand the threshold ligand concentration is\n$$\nC_L^{*} = 3.23 \\times 10^{-7} + 9.70 \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 1.003 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}.\n$$\nThus, the correct criterion and numerical threshold are those in option A.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: States $C_L^{*} = \\dfrac{C_M^{\\mathrm{T}} - s_0}{K_{f}\\,s_0} + \\left(C_M^{\\mathrm{T}} - s_0\\right)$ with $s_0 = \\dfrac{K_{sp}}{[OH^{-}]^{2}}$, exactly as derived from mass balances and the law of mass action at the saturation boundary. The numerical value $C_L^{*} \\approx 1.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ matches our calculation. Verdict — Correct.\n\n- Option B: Retains only the first term $\\dfrac{C_M^{\\mathrm{T}} - s_0}{K_{f}\\,s_0}$ and omits the additive $(C_M^{\\mathrm{T}} - s_0)$ from ligand mass balance. This underestimates the ligand required by neglecting that most ligand must be present to bind almost all metal (except $s_0$) when no solid forms. Verdict — Incorrect (incomplete mass balance).\n\n- Option C: Uses $C_L^{*} = C_M^{\\mathrm{T}} - s_0$, which corresponds to the $K_{f} \\to \\infty$ limit (infinitely strong complex) and ignores finite $K_{f}$. Although numerically close here because $K_{f}\\,s_0 \\gg 1$, it is not the correct general criterion and is low by about $3\\,\\%$ under the given constants. Verdict — Incorrect (neglects finite complex stability).\n\n- Option D: Proposes $C_L^{*} = \\dfrac{1}{K_{f}}\\dfrac{K_{sp}}{[OH^{-}]^{2}} = \\dfrac{s_0}{K_{f}}$, which would arise from forcing $K_{f}\\,[L] \\approx 1$ with $[L] \\approx C_L^{\\mathrm{T}}$ and ignoring the metal mass balance. It grossly underestimates the ligand needed because it does not account for the necessity to complex essentially the entire metal inventory above $s_0$. Verdict — Incorrect (violates the coupled metal–ligand mass balances).\n\nTherefore, option A is the only response that correctly encodes the mass-balance framework and predicts the threshold in $C_L^{\\mathrm{T}}$ separating precipitation and complexation dominance at the stated conditions.",
