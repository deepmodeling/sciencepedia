            "introduction": "The most fundamental property of a crystalline material is its chemical composition. Crystallography provides a direct link between the atomic arrangement within a unit cell and the material's empirical formula. This practice solidifies your ability to perform this essential task by applying the atom-sharing rules for corners, edges, and faces, while also incorporating the realistic complication of lattice vacancies. Successfully determining the stoichiometry  is the first step towards understanding and predicting a material's behavior.",

            "problem": "A novel ternary intermetallic compound containing Promethium (Pm), Samarium (Sm), and Europium (Eu) is being investigated for its magnetic properties. X-ray crystallography reveals that the compound has a cubic unit cell. Within this unit cell, Pm atoms are located at the corner positions, Sm atoms are at the face-centered positions, and Eu atoms are positioned at the edge-centered positions. The crystal lattice is not perfect; detailed analysis indicates that, on average, one corner site is vacant and two edge-centered sites are vacant in each unit cell. All face-centered sites are occupied. Determine the simplest empirical formula for this non-stoichiometric compound. The formula should be written in the format Pm$_a$Sm$_b$Eu$_c$, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are the smallest possible integers.",
            "solution": "A cubic unit cell has 8 corner sites, 6 face-centered sites, and 12 edge-centered sites. The contributions to the unit cell are $1/8$ per corner atom, $1/2$ per face-centered atom, and $1/4$ per edge-centered atom.\n\nGiven that Pm occupies corners with one corner vacancy per unit cell, the number of Pm atoms per unit cell is\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{Pm}} = (8 - 1)\\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}.\n$$\nSm occupies all face-centered sites fully, so\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{Sm}} = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3.\n$$\nEu occupies edges with two edge vacancies per unit cell, so\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{Eu}} = (12 - 2)\\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{5}{2}.\n$$\n\nThe empirical formula is proportional to $N_{\\mathrm{Pm}} : N_{\\mathrm{Sm}} : N_{\\mathrm{Eu}} = \\frac{7}{8} : 3 : \\frac{5}{2}$. To convert to the smallest integers, multiply by the least common multiple of denominators, which is $8$:\n$$\na = 8 \\times \\frac{7}{8} = 7, \\quad b = 8 \\times 3 = 24, \\quad c = 8 \\times \\frac{5}{2} = 20.\n$$\nSince $\\gcd(7,24,20) = 1$, these are already the smallest integers.

Planar atomic density is a critical parameter that influences surface phenomena such as catalysis, corrosion, and thin-film growth.

The side length of its conventional unit cell, known as the lattice constant, is denoted by $a$. An important characteristic of a crystal is its planar atomic density, which influences properties like surface energy and chemical reactivity. For a specific crystallographic plane, this density is defined as the total number of atoms effectively centered on that plane within a single unit cell, divided by the total area of the plane's cross-section within that same unit cell.\n\nCalculate the planar atomic density for the (110) plane of this FCC crystal.

The side lengths of this rectangle are $a$ and the diagonal of a face, which is $\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = a\\sqrt{2}$.\n    Therefore, the area of the plane's cross-section within the unit cell is:\n    $$\n    A = a \\times a\\sqrt{2} = a^2\\sqrt{2}.\n    $$\n\n2.  **Number of Atoms on the Plane:**\n    For an FCC lattice, atoms are located at the corners and face centers of the conventional unit cell. We count the atoms whose centers lie on this rectangular area. The 2D unit cell for this plane is a rectangle containing:\n    - Atoms at the 4 corners of the rectangle. Each corner atom is shared by 4 adjacent planar unit cells.\n    - 1 atom at the center of the rectangle.
