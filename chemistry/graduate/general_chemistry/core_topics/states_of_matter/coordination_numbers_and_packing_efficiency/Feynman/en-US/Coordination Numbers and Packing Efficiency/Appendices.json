Compute the packing fraction.\n\n2.  **Validation Verdict**: The problem is **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of crystallography, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, precise terms. It is a fundamental problem that tests core concepts without fallacy or ambiguity.\n\nWe will now proceed with the solution in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Relation between Atomic Radius ($r$) and Lattice Parameter ($a$)**\n\nThe body-centered cubic (bcc) unit cell is a cube of side length $a$ with atoms at each of the $8$ corners and one atom at the geometric center of the cube. Under the hard-sphere model, atoms are assumed to be in contact with their nearest neighbors. In the bcc structure, the corner atoms do not touch each other along the edges or face diagonals. Contact occurs along the body diagonal of the cube, which connects opposite corners and passes through the central atom.\n\nThe length of the body diagonal, $d_{body}$, of a cube with edge length $a$ is found using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions:\n$$d_{body} = \\sqrt{a^2 + a^2 + a^2} = \\sqrt{3a^2} = a\\sqrt{3}$$\nThis diagonal passes through the center of the atom at one corner (radius $r$), the full diameter of the central atom (diameter $2r$), and the center of the atom at the opposite corner (radius $r$). The total length along this line occupied by the touching spheres is therefore:\n$$d_{body} = r + 2r + r = 4r$$\nBy equating the geometric length of the body diagonal with the length required for the hard spheres to touch, we establish the fundamental relationship for the bcc structure:\n$$4r = a\\sqrt{3}$$\nThis gives the atomic radius $r$ as a function of the lattice parameter $a$:\n$$r = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}$$\nFor tungsten, the given lattice parameter is $a = 3.1652\\ \\text{\\AA}$. Substituting this value into the derived relation yields the atomic radius:\n$$r = \\frac{(3.1652\\ \\text{\\AA})\\sqrt{3}}{4}$$\nNumerically, this is calculated as:\n$$r \\approx \\frac{(3.1652)(1.7320508)}{4}\\ \\text{\\AA} \\approx \\frac{5.48303}{4}\\ \\text{\\AA} \\approx 1.370757\\ \\text{\\AA}$$\nAs requested, rounding this value to four significant figures gives:\n$$r \\approx 1.371\\ \\text{\\AA}$$\n\n**Part 2: Coordination Number and Nearest-Neighbor Distance**\n\nThe coordination number (CN) is defined as the number of nearest neighbors to a given atom in the crystal lattice. By symmetry, every atom in the bcc lattice is equivalent, so we may analyze the environment of any single atom. It is most convenient to consider the atom at the body center of the unit cell, located at fractional coordinates $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n\nThe neighbors to this central atom are the $8$ atoms located at the corners of the same unit cell. The corner positions are $(0, 0, 0)$, $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$, $(0, 0, 1)$, $(1, 1, 0)$, $(1, 0, 1)$, $(0, 1, 1)$, and $(1, 1, 1)$. The distance, $d_{nn}$, from the central atom to any of these corner atoms is identical. Let us calculate this distance to the corner at $(0, 0, 0)$:\n$$d_{nn} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}a - 0\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}a - 0\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}a - 0\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3a^2}{4}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nThis is the nearest-neighbor distance. According to the hard-sphere model, this distance must be equal to the sum of two atomic radii, $2r$. Using our result from Part 1, $r = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}$, we can verify this:\n$$2r = 2\\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right) = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nThis confirms the consistency of the geometry. Since the central atom is equidistant from all $8$ corner atoms, it has $8$ nearest neighbors.\n\nTo confirm that these are indeed the *nearest* neighbors, we must identify the next-nearest neighbors and show their distance is greater. The next-nearest neighbors to the central atom are the central atoms of the $6$ adjacent unit cells, which are located at positions such as $(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$, $(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$, etc. The distance to these atoms is simply the lattice parameter, $a$.\nAlternatively, considering the atom at the origin $(0,0,0)$, its next-nearest neighbors are the atoms at the corners of its own cell that it does not touch, such as the one at $(1,0,0)$. The distance is $a$.\nWe compare the nearest-neighbor distance $d_{nn}$ with the next-nearest-neighbor distance $d_{nnn}$:\n$$d_{nn} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866a$$\n$$d_{nnn} = a$$\nSince $d_{nn}  d_{nnn}$, the set of $8$ neighbors at distance $\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is exhaustive. Therefore, the coordination number for the bcc structure is $8$.\n\n**Part 3: Packing Fraction**\n\nThe packing fraction (PF), or atomic packing factor (APF), is the fraction of the total volume of the unit cell that is occupied by atoms. It is defined as:\n$$PF = \\frac{N \\times V_{atom}}{V_{cell}}$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of atoms per unit cell, $V_{atom}$ is the volume of a single atom, and $V_{cell}$ is the volume of the unit cell.\n\nFor the bcc structure, the number of atoms per unit cell, $N$, is calculated as:\n- $1$ atom at the body center (fully contained within the cell): $1 \\times 1 = 1$\n- $8$ atoms at the corners, each shared by $8$ adjacent cells: $8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$\nTotal atoms per unit cell: $N = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe volume of the cubic unit cell is $V_{cell} = a^3$.\nThe volume of a single spherical atom is $V_{atom} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\n\nSubstituting these into the packing fraction formula gives its dependence on $a$ and $r$:\n$$PF = \\frac{2 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}{a^3} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}\\pi r^3}{a^3}$$\nTo obtain a dimensionless value, we use the relationship $r = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ derived in Part 1 to eliminate the variables $a$ and $r$:\n$$PF = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^3}{a^3} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a^3 (\\sqrt{3})^3}{4^3}\\right)}{a^3}$$\nThe $a^3$ terms cancel, as expected for a structural constant:\n$$PF = \\frac{8\\pi}{3} \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{64} = \\frac{24\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{192} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8}$$\nThis is the exact analytical expression for the packing fraction of a bcc lattice.\n\nThe consistency of this result with the coordination number analysis is qualitative. A higher coordination number generally corresponds to a more efficient packing of spheres. The bcc structure, with $CN=8$, is more densely packed than the simple cubic structure ($CN=6$, $PF = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\approx 0.5236$), but less dense than the close-packed structures (fcc and hcp, with $CN=12$, $PF = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.7405$). The calculated PF for bcc fits logically within this hierarchy.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the packing fraction and round it to five significant figures as requested:\n$$PF = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8} \\approx \\frac{(3.14159265...)(1.73205081...)}{8} \\approx \\frac{5.441397...}{8} \\approx 0.680174...$$\nRounding to five significant figures gives:\n$$PF \\approx 0.68017$$\nThis completes the required analysis.",

            "problem": "An ionic compound of stoichiometry $AB$ is to be designed such that the cation $A^{z_+}$ achieves coordination number $8$ by occupying a cubic interstice formed by eight anions $B^{z_-}$. Assume the hard-sphere model with $A$ and $B$ represented as non-deformable spheres of radii $r_A$ and $r_B$, respectively. The crystal is proposed to adopt the cesium chloride (CsCl) arrangement, in which one species resides at the simple-cubic lattice points and the other at the body centers of the cubes. Using only geometric constraints and the definition of coordination number, determine the critical minimum radius ratio $x_{\\min} = r_A/r_B$ such that the cation $A$ just fits into the cubic site formed by the eight $B$ anions without forcing $B$–$B$ separation beyond contact at the instability threshold.

Do not provide any verbal assessment in your final answer. You may assume that all electrostatic considerations are subordinate to the hard-sphere geometric criterion at the stability threshold, and that the conventional cubic cell edge length is $a$ where appropriate.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed geometric problem from solid-state chemistry that can be resolved using fundamental principles of crystallography and the hard-sphere model.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first establishing the geometric relationships within the cesium chloride (CsCl) crystal lattice structure. In this arrangement, we conceptualize the anions $B^{z_-}$ as occupying the vertices of a simple cubic unit cell, with the cation $A^{z_+}$ situated at the body-center position. Let the edge length of this cubic cell be denoted by the parameter $a$.\n\nThe first critical condition is that the cation $A$ is in direct contact with its $8$ nearest-neighbor anions $B$. The distance from the body center of the cube (with fractional coordinates $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$) to any corner (e.g., coordinates $(0, 0, 0)$) is half the length of the space diagonal of the cube. The length of the space diagonal is $\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2 + a^2} = a\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the center-to-center distance between the cation $A$ and an anion $B$ is given by $\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. According to the hard-sphere model, for these particles to be in contact, this distance must be equal to the sum of their radii, $r_A + r_B$. This gives our first equation:\n$$r_A + r_B = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\n\nThe second critical condition, which defines the instability threshold and thus the minimum radius ratio for this coordination number, is that the anions $B$ are also in mutual contact. In the simple cubic arrangement of anions, the closest distance between the centers of two adjacent anions is along the edge of the cube. This distance is simply the lattice constant, $a$. For these anions to be in contact, this distance must be equal to the sum of their radii, which is $r_B + r_B = 2r_B$. This establishes our second equation:\n$$a = 2r_B$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations that must be satisfied simultaneously at the specified geometric limit. We can substitute the expression for $a$ from the second equation into the first equation to eliminate the lattice parameter $a$ and establish a direct relationship between the radii $r_A$ and $r_B$.\nSubstituting $a = 2r_B$ into the first equation yields:\n$$r_A + r_B = \\frac{(2r_B)\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nSimplifying the right side of the equation gives:\n$$r_A + r_B = r_B\\sqrt{3}$$\nTo find the relationship between $r_A$ and $r_B$, we isolate the term $r_A$:\n$$r_A = r_B\\sqrt{3} - r_B$$\nFactoring out $r_B$ from the right-hand side, we obtain:\n$$r_A = r_B(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$$\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the critical minimum radius ratio, defined as $x_{\\min} = \\frac{r_A}{r_B}$. We can find this value by dividing the last equation by $r_B$:\n$$\\frac{r_A}{r_B} = \\sqrt{3} - 1$$\nThis result represents the ideal radius ratio where the cation just fits into the cubic void created by eight mutually-touching anions. If the ratio $\\frac{r_A}{r_B}$ were any smaller, the cation would be too small to maintain simultaneous contact with all eight anions, leading to a \"rattling\" condition and an energetically unfavorable configuration, likely resulting in a transition to a structure with a lower coordination number (e.g., $6$). Thus, this value is correctly identified as the critical minimum radius ratio, $x_{\\min}$.",

            "problem": "An approximate hard-sphere model links coordination number to the ability of a cation of radius $r_{+}$ to fit into interstitial voids formed by a close-packed array of anions of radius $r_{-}$, with higher coordination requiring larger $r_{+}/r_{-}$. In real solids, strong directional (covalent) bonding can reduce the effective packing efficiency and drive coordination numbers lower than the hard-sphere prediction. Consider the following choices, each pairing a compound with a proposed reason for a deviation from the radius ratio rule. Using first principles of interstitial geometry for close-packed anion arrays and the concept of directional bonding, decide which choice(s) correctly identify an example where the radius ratio rule fails because of strong directional bonding and correctly articulate the underlying electronic-structure reason. Use the following approximate ionic radii (in Å) to estimate $r_{+}/r_{-}$ when needed: $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ $1.02$, $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ $1.81$, $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ $0.72$, $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ $1.40$, $\\mathrm{Ag}^+$ $1.15$, $\\mathrm{I}^-$ $2.20$, $\\mathrm{Cu}^+$ $0.77$, $\\mathrm{F}^-$ $1.33$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{2+}$ $0.27$.\n\nA. $\\mathrm{AgI}$ at ambient conditions adopts a tetrahedrally coordinated wurtzite or zinc blende network even though $r_{+}/r_{-}$ places it in the range usually associated with octahedral coordination.

This deviation arises from strong directional bonding associated with the $d^{10}$ configuration of $\\mathrm{Cu}^+$ and second-order Jahn–Teller coupling with $4s/4p$ states, together with the appreciable polarizability of $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$, all of which favor four-coordinate, less efficiently packed frameworks.\n\nE. $\\mathrm{BeF}_2$ at ambient conditions is an example of failure because $r_{+}/r_{-}$ implies octahedral coordination, yet it adopts a tetrahedrally coordinated quartz-like network due to $p\\pi$–$d\\pi$ bonding on beryllium that creates directional preferences.\n\nSelect all that apply. Justify your choice(s) by starting from interstitial void geometry in close-packed anion arrays and the physical meaning of directional bonding and packing efficiency. Do not assume any empirical “exceptions” without analysis.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an evaluation of several assertions regarding the failure of the hard-sphere radius ratio model for predicting coordination numbers in ionic solids. The central premise is that strong directional covalent bonding can favor structures with lower coordination numbers and packing efficiencies than those predicted by a simple ionic model based on maximizing electrostatic interactions in a close-packed lattice.\n\nFirst, we must establish the theoretical framework. The radius ratio rule provides a geometric prediction for the stable coordination number (CN) of a cation with radius $r_{+}$ surrounded by anions of radius $r_{-}$. The critical radius ratios are derived from the geometry of interstitial sites in an array of anions:\n-   For tetrahedral coordination (CN = $4$), the ideal ratio is $r_{+}/r_{-} = \\sqrt{3/2} - 1 \\approx 0.225$. The typical range is $0.225 \\le r_{+}/r_{-}  0.414$.\n-   For octahedral coordination (CN = $6$), the ideal ratio is $r_{+}/r_{-} = \\sqrt{2} - 1 \\approx 0.414$. The typical range is $0.414 \\le r_{+}/r_{-}  0.732$.\n-   For cubic coordination (CN = $8$), the ideal ratio is $r_{+}/r_{-} = \\sqrt{3} - 1 \\approx 0.732$. The typical range is $0.732 \\le r_{+}/r_{-}  1.0$.\n\nA deviation from this rule, specifically adopting a lower CN than predicted, suggests that factors other than simple ionic packing are dominant. The problem posits that strong directional covalent bonding is such a factor. We will now evaluate each option against this framework using the provided ionic radii.\n\n**A. $\\mathrm{AgI}$**\n1.  **Radius Ratio Calculation:** For $\\mathrm{AgI}$, the cation is $\\mathrm{Ag}^+$ with $r_{+} = 1.15$ Å, and the anion is $\\mathrm{I}^-$ with $r_{-} = 2.20$ Å. The radius ratio is:\n    $$ \\frac{r_{+}}{r_{-}} = \\frac{1.15}{2.20} \\approx 0.523 $$\n2.  **Hard-Sphere Prediction:** This value falls squarely in the range for octahedral coordination ($0.414 \\le 0.523  0.732$). The predicted CN is $6$.\n3.  **Actual Structure and Deviation:** The problem states that $\\mathrm{AgI}$ adopts the wurtzite or zinc blende structure, where the coordination is tetrahedral (CN = $4$). This represents a clear deviation from the hard-sphere prediction; the coordination number is lower than expected.\n4.  **Evaluation of Explanation:** The explanation attributes this deviation to the $d^{10}$ configuration of $\\mathrm{Ag}^+$ ($[Kr]4d^{10}$). It proposes a second-order Jahn-Teller (SOJT) or pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect involving mixing between the filled valence $4d$ orbitals and the low-lying empty $5s/5p$ orbitals. This $d-s-p$ mixing is symmetry-allowed in a tetrahedral environment but not in a centrosymmetric octahedral one, and it facilitates the formation of four strong, directional covalent bonds. This covalent stabilization outweighs the loss of Madelung energy from adopting a lower coordination number. The high polarizability ('softness') of the large $\\mathrm{I}^-$ anion is crucial as it enhances orbital overlap and covalent character. This is a standard and correct explanation for the structural preferences of many $d^{10}$ metal compounds. The statement accurately identifies a deviation and provides a sound, scientifically correct electronic-structure reason.\n\nTherefore, statement A is **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\mathrm{NaCl}$**\n1.  **Radius Ratio Calculation:** For $\\mathrm{NaCl}$, $r_{\\mathrm{Na}^+} = 1.02$ Å and $r_{\\mathrm{Cl}^-} = 1.81$ Å.\n    $$ \\frac{r_{+}}{r_{-}} = \\frac{1.02}{1.81} \\approx 0.564 $$\n2.  **Hard-Sphere Prediction:** This ratio is within the range for octahedral coordination ($0.414 \\le 0.564  0.732$). The predicted CN is $6$.\n3.  **Actual Structure and Deviation:** $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ adopts the rock-salt structure, which has octahedral coordination (CN = $6$). There is no deviation; the compound follows the radius ratio rule. The premise of the option is that the rule is violated, which is false.\n4.  **Evaluation of Explanation:** The explanation invokes $p\\pi$–$d\\pi$ backbonding from $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ to $\\mathrm{Na}^+$. This is chemically baseless. The $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ ion has a noble gas configuration ($[Ne]$). Its valence shell is $n=2$ and it has no low-lying $d$ orbitals to accept electron density via $\\pi$-bonding. This mechanism is impossible for sodium.\n\nTherefore, statement B is **Incorrect**. It is wrong about the deviation and wrong about the electronic chemistry.\n\n**C. $\\mathrm{MgO}$**\n1.  **Radius Ratio Calculation:** For $\\mathrm{MgO}$, $r_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}} = 0.72$ Å and $r_{\\mathrm{O}^{2-}} = 1.40$ Å.\n    $$ \\frac{r_{+}}{r_{-}} = \\frac{0.72}{1.40} \\approx 0.514 $$\n2.  **Hard-Sphere Prediction:** This ratio is in the range for octahedral coordination ($0.414 \\le 0.514  0.732$). The predicted CN is $6$.\n3.  **Actual Structure and Deviation:** $\\mathrm{MgO}$ adopts the rock-salt structure (CN = $6$). As with $\\mathrm{NaCl}$, there is no deviation. The premise of the option is false.\n4.  **Evaluation of Explanation:** The explanation states that the \"small and hard\" $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ion forms directional bonds. This is a contradiction in terms. $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ is a classic example of a hard, non-polarizable cation with a stable noble gas configuration ($[Ne]$) that forms bonds with very high ionic character. Its interactions are predominantly electrostatic and non-directional, which is precisely why it conforms so well to the ionic model.\n\nTherefore, statement C is **Incorrect**. The premise of a violation is false, and the chemical reasoning is flawed.\n\n**D. $\\mathrm{CuCl}$**\n1.  **Radius Ratio Calculation:** For $\\mathrm{CuCl}$, $r_{\\mathrm{Cu}^+} = 0.77$ Å and $r_{\\mathrm{Cl}^-} = 1.81$ Å.\n    $$ \\frac{r_{+}}{r_{-}} = \\frac{0.77}{1.81} \\approx 0.426 $$\n2.  **Hard-Sphere Prediction:** This ratio is just above the threshold of $0.414$, placing it in the range for octahedral coordination ($0.414 \\le 0.426  0.732$). The predicted CN is $6$.\n3.  **Actual Structure and Deviation:** The problem states $\\mathrm{CuCl}$ adopts the zinc blende structure, which has tetrahedral coordination (CN = $4$). This is a deviation from the prediction, favoring a lower coordination number.\n4.  **Evaluation of Explanation:** The explanation is analogous to that for $\\mathrm{AgI}$. It cites the $d^{10}$ configuration of $\\mathrm{Cu}^+$ ($[Ar]3d^{10}$), SOJT coupling with empty $4s/4p$ states, and the polarizability of $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$. This combination promotes strong, directional, tetrahedral covalent bonding via $d-s-p$ hybridization. While $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ is less polarizable than $\\mathrm{I}^-$, it is sufficiently polarizable to allow for significant covalent character with the \"soft\" $\\mathrm{Cu}^+$ cation. The energetic gain from forming these four strong covalent bonds overcomes the preference for a higher coordination number based on ionic packing considerations. The explanation is scientifically sound.\n\nTherefore, statement D is **Correct**.\n\n**E. $\\mathrm{BeF}_2$**\n1.  **Radius Ratio Calculation:** For $\\mathrm{BeF}_2$, $r_{\\mathrm{Be}^{2+}} = 0.27$ Å and $r_{\\mathrm{F}^{-}} = 1.33$ Å.\n    $$ \\frac{r_{+}}{r_{-}} = \\frac{0.27}{1.33} \\approx 0.203 $$\n2.  **Hard-Sphere Prediction:** This ratio is very small, falling below the minimum for stable tetrahedral coordination ($r_{+}/r_{-}  0.225$). The hard-sphere model would predict a coordination number of $3$ or possibly $4$ if the anions are not in contact. The statement's claim that the ratio \"implies octahedral coordination\" is grossly incorrect.\n3.  **Actual Structure and Deviation:** The compound adopts a tetrahedrally coordinated network (CN = $4$). Given the very low ratio, achieving even tetrahedral coordination indicates significant covalent bonding is overriding the geometric constraints, but the premise of the question is flawed.\n4.  **Evaluation of Explanation:** The explanation invokes \"$p\\pi$–$d\\pi$ bonding on beryllium\". This is chemically impossible. Beryllium is a second-period element; its valence shell ($n=2$) contains no $d$ orbitals. The lowest unoccupied $d$ orbitals (the $3d$ set) are far too high in energy to participate in bonding. The significant covalent character and tetrahedral structure of $\\mathrm{BeF}_2$ are due to the high polarizing power of the tiny $\\mathrm{Be}^{2+}$ ion leading to $sp^3$ hybridization, not any involvement of $d$ orbitals.\n\nTherefore, statement E is **Incorrect**. The premise regarding the predicted CN is false, and the electronic explanation is impossible.\n\nIn summary, only options A and D correctly identify compounds that deviate from the radius ratio rule and provide a valid, sophisticated explanation based on the electronic structure of $d^{10}$ cations leading to directional covalent bonding.",
